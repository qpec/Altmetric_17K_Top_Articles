Abstract
Objective—To present comprehensive descriptive summaries of program interruptions and short-
stay transfers among Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries receiving inpatient rehabilitation 
following stroke, traumatic brain injury (TBI), and traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI).
Design—Retrospective cohort study of Medicare beneficiaries with any of the three conditions of 
interest who were admitted to inpatient rehabilitation directly from an acute hospital between July 
1, 2012 and November 15, 2013.
Results—In the final sample (stroke: n=71 769; TBI: n=7109; SCI: n=659), program interruption 
rates were 0.9% (stroke), 0.8% (TBI), and 1.4% (SCI). Short-stay transfer rates were 22.3% 
(stroke), 21.8% (TBI), and 31.6% (SCI). 14.7% of short-stay transfers and 12.3% of interruptions 
resulting in a return to acute care were identified as potentially preventable among those with 
stroke, 10.2% of transfers and 11.7% of interruptions among those with TBI, and 3.8% of transfers 
and 11.1% of interruptions among those with SCI.
Conclusions—Broad healthcare policies aimed at improving quality and reducing costs are 
currently being implemented. Reducing program interruptions and short-stay transfers during 
inpatient rehabilitative care represents a potential target for care-improvement efforts. Future 
research focused on identifying modifiable risk factors for potentially undesirable outcomes will 
allow for targeted preventative interventions.

 INTRODUCTION
Policy reforms aimed at improving quality and reducing costs of healthcare are currently 
being implemented.1 Inpatient rehabilitation facilities are a focus of many initiatives, as 
these facilities provide intensive rehabilitative care in a medical setting and are often viewed 
as a costly postacute care alternative.2 For this level of care to be “reasonable and 
necessary,” the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) require that patients be 
sufficiently stable at the time of admission, need at least two modalities of therapy, be able to 
actively participate in and benefit from intensive therapy, and require supervision by a 
physician.3 Potential patients are screened prior to admission and evaluated post-admission 
by a physician to ensure eligibility.4 Despite these requisites, not all patients complete their 
rehabilitation programs as planned. Program interruptions and short-stay transfers are 
undesirable outcomes that may impact patient recovery and healthcare expenditures.5-7
CMS defines a program interruption as a transfer from an inpatient rehabilitation facility to 
another setting with a return to the facility within three days to continue rehabilitation.8 A 
program interruption often represents a complication that results in disrupted rehabilitative 
care. Between 2002 and 2008 the program interruption rate ranged from 0.9% to 1.6% for 
patients receiving rehabilitation following stroke9 and 1.0% to 1.8% for patients receiving 
rehabilitation following traumatic brain injury (TBI).10 Between 2002 and 2010 the program 
interruption rate for patients with traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) ranged from 1.6% to 
3.5% for those who used a wheelchair for locomotion and from 0.9% to 2.1% for those who 
were ambulatory.11 Although program interruptions are an undesirable outcome, only 
incidence has been reported.9-12
Short-stay transfers are defined by CMS as a transfer from an inpatient rehabilitation facility 
to another institutional setting prior to the length of stay projected for the patient. This 
length of stay is based on the average length of stay given the patient's Case-Mix Group and 
comorbidities. Case-Mix Groups are assigned by CMS at inpatient rehabilitation admission 
and reflect the patients’ diagnosis, age, and functional status.4 Short-stay transfers should 
not be confused with another similarly named CMS outcome- short stays. Short stays are 
stays that are three days or less.13 For clarification, short-stay transfers are the outcome 
referred to in this article. In other words, we were interested in inpatient rehabilitation stays 
longer than 3 days that ended in a transfer to another institutional setting prior to the average 
length of stay given the patient's Case-Mix Group and comorbidities. Short-stay transfers 
may represent truncated rehabilitative care.
Previous investigations have focused on transfers from inpatient rehabilitation facilities to 
acute care settings occurring at any point during the rehabilitation stay or within three days 
of admission, not on CMS-defined short-stay transfers.5,14-16 Short-stay transfers differ from 
the typically reported return to acute care outcome in two important ways. First, short-stay 
transfers have a time-dependent definition (i.e. prior to average length of stay given the 
patient's Case-Mix Group and comorbidities).13 Additionally, short-stay transfers encompass 
transfers to any institutional setting accepting payment from CMS, not just acute care.17 
Although these patients met the criteria for inpatient rehabilitation admission, they were 
discharged to institutional care rather than returning to the community. The Medicare

 Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) considers this a poor outcome for the patient and 
may reflect an inefficient use of resources.3 As with program interruptions, basic descriptive 
information on short-stay transfers is limited.
Improving postacute outcomes is a current focus of CMS quality improvement initiatives.4 
In addition to the established metrics, program interruptions and short-stay transfers may be 
sensible provider performance measures. What is needed now is a better understanding of 
potential sociodemographic and clinical characteristics associated with program 
interruptions and short-stay transfers as well as percentages of these disruptive outcomes 
that may be potentially preventable. In turn, this may provide insight into whether these 
outcomes represent targets for care-improvement efforts.3 The objective of this study was to 
present comprehensive descriptive summaries of program interruptions and short-stay 
transfers among Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries receiving inpatient rehabilitation 
following stroke, TBI, and traumatic SCI. These three diagnostic categories were selected 
because they represent 1) an increasing percentage of the inpatient rehabilitation case mix2 
and 2) patients at increased risk for negative outcomes during and/or following post-acute 
care.14-16,18 We hypothesized that both the rates of and the reasons for program interruptions 
and short-stay transfers would differ across the diagnostic categories. Such findings would 
have important implications for policy-makers and providers if either outcome were selected 
as a performance measure.
METHODS
Data Sources
Data were extracted from the following 2012 to 2013 100% Medicare files: Inpatient 
Rehabilitation Facility-Patient Assessment Instrument (IRF-PAI), Medicare Provider 
Analysis and Review (MedPAR), and Beneficiary Summary files. The IRF-PAI file was used 
for sample selection, and then patient data from the MedPAR and Beneficiary Summary files 
were linked and integrated with the IRF-PAI data. The study was approved by the University 
Institutional Review Board, and a Data Use Agreement was completed following CMS 
requirements.
Patient Population
IRF-PAI assessment records for all patients admitted between July 1, 2012 and November 
15, 2013 were reviewed for inclusion. This time frame was selected to allow a 6-month look 
back before admission, while accounting for maximum inpatient rehabilitation (45 days) 
lengths of stays. The population of interest was patients admitted directly from acute care for 
initial rehabilitation for stroke, TBI, or traumatic SCI. Patients who had inpatient 
rehabilitation stays of less than three days were excluded, as stays less than three days are 
recognized by CMS as a separate outcome from short-stay transfers.19 Additionally, those 
who did not survive their stay, were discharged against medical advice, were not admitted to 
acute care and inpatient rehabilitation for the same diagnosis (i.e. stroke, TBI, SCI), or were 
not Medicare-feefor-service over the relevant period (6 months prior to index hospitalization 
through inpatient rehabilitation) were excluded (Figure 1). To determine if patients were 
admitted to acute care and inpatient rehabilitation for the same diagnosis, the patient's

 primary hospital diagnosis (ICD-9 code) was compared to their inpatient rehabilitation 
impairment group. The list of ICD-9 codes related to inpatient rehabilitation impairment 
groups available in The Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility- Patient Assessment Instrument 
(IRF-PAI) Training Manual was used to verify matching diagnoses.20
Outcomes
We defined a program interruption as a three day or less claim from another inpatient 
provider occurring during an inpatient rehabilitation stay.8 A short-stay transfer was defined 
as discharge to an institutional setting prior to the average length of stay for the patient's 
Case-Mix Group and comorbidities.4 Patients are classified at admission to rehabilitation 
into a Case-Mix Group based on their primary impairment, functional status, and age. 
Patients within the same Case Mix Group are predicted to require similar resource 
utilization, for example length of stay. Accordingly, each Case Mix Group and comorbidity 
tier combination has an associated average length of stay, which is updated annually by 
CMS and used for payment purposes.4 Patients who did not experience a program 
interruption or short-stay transfer were considered to have an “uninterrupted stay” for 
comparative purposes.
Potentially preventable program interruptions and short-stay transfers to acute care settings 
were identified using the Prevention Quality Indicators developed by the Agency for 
Healthcare Research and Quality.21 This approach identifies hospital admissions for 
“ambulatory care sensitive conditions;” conditions that should not occur under appropriate 
outpatient care.21 Accordingly, these conditions should also not occur while receiving care 
in an inpatient facility. Examples of potentially preventable diagnoses include urinary tract 
infections, dehydration, bacterial pneumonia, and heart failure. A detailed description of the 
Prevention Quality Indicators is available through the Agency for Healthcare Research and 
Quality.21
Descriptors
Based on a review of the literature and clinical judgment, the following sociodemographic 
and clinical variables were selected for a descriptive analysis of program interruptions and 
short-stay transfers among patients receiving inpatient rehabilitation following stroke, TBI, 
and traumatic SCI. The sociodemographic characteristics extracted were patient age 
(continuous), gender (male/female), race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic 
Black, Hispanic/Latino, or Other), disability entitlement (yes/no, disability original reason 
for Medicare enrollment), and dual eligibility (yes/no, Medicare and Medicaid eligible). The 
clinical descriptors extracted were number of hospital admissions over the six months prior 
to the index hospital admission (count), index hospital length of stay (days), comorbidity tier 
(no tier, low, medium, high), and functional status (continuous, FIMs™ instrument).
Comorbidity Tier—At inpatient rehabilitation admission, patients are assigned to one of 
four comorbidity tiers developed by CMS as part of the inpatient rehabilitation prospective 
payment system.2 Reimbursement under the prospective payment system is based on patient 
characteristics and subsequent expected resource utilization. The CMS comorbidity tiers 
reflect the severity of patients’ comorbid conditions and are weighted based on the relative

 cost of treating patients within in that tier compared to the average patient. Comorbid 
conditions in the higher tier are projected to require greater resource utilization, which is 
reflected in Medicare reimbursement.19 The CMS comorbidity tiers may provide a proxy for 
a patient's overall health beyond the inpatient rehabilitation admitting diagnosis (e.g. stroke, 
TBI, traumatic SCI).
Functional Status—In the inpatient rehabilitation setting, functional status is evaluated at 
admission and discharge as part of the IRF-PAI using items from the FIM instrument.8 The 
FIM assesses patient independence during performance of 18 items rated on a seven-point 
scale (1=total assistance, 7=complete independence, score range 18-126 points). The 
instrument covers self-care, sphincter control, transfers, locomotion, communication, and 
social cognition and can be subdivided into separate Motor (13 items, score range 13-91 
points) and Cognitive (5 items, score range 5-35 points) scales.
Data Analysis
Patients within each diagnostic category (stroke, TBI, traumatic SCI) were classified into 
one of three outcome groups: “Uninterrupted Stay”, “Program Interruption”, or “Short-stay 
Transfer.” Short-stay transfers were further dichotomized into transfers to an acute care 
setting (short-stay acute care hospital, long-term acute care hospital, or psychiatric hospital) 
and transfers to a non-acute care setting (skilled nursing facility or another inpatient 
rehabilitation facility). Descriptive statistics (means, standard deviations, counts, 
percentages) were calculated for the selected variables within each outcome group.
RESULTS
Study Samples
The final sample included 71 769 individuals with stroke, 7109 individuals with TBI, and 
659 individuals with SCI. Sample characteristics by diagnostic category (stroke, TBI, SCI) 
and outcome (uninterrupted stay, program interruption, short-stay transfer) are presented in 
Tables 1-3.
Program Interruptions
The program interruption rates were 0.9% for individuals with stroke, 0.8% for individuals 
with TBI, and 1.4% for individuals with SCI (Tables 1-3). Descriptive statistics for 
individuals with SCI experiencing program interruptions are not presented in Table 3 due to 
the low occurrence of this outcome. In accordance with CMS data use guidelines, cell sizes 
less than 11 are suppressed. An acute hospital was the setting for 99.8% of program 
interruptions among individuals with stroke and 100% of program interruptions among those 
with TBI and those with SCI. Reasons for hospital admission varied across the diagnostic 
groups (Table 4). Individuals with stroke or TBI were admitted most frequently for stroke or 
brain injury-related complications.
Within program interruptions, 12.3% were identified as potentially preventable among 
individuals with stroke, 11.7% among individuals with TBI, and 11.1% among individuals 
with SCI. Of the potentially preventable conditions resulting in program interruptions, the

 most frequent were dehydration conditions (35.9%) and urinary tract infections (28.2%) 
among patients with stroke, and urinary tract infections (42.9%) and heart failure (28.6%) 
among individuals with TBI.
Short-Stay Transfers
The short-stay transfer rates were 22.3% among individuals with stroke, 21.8% among 
individuals with TBI, and 31.6% among individuals with SCI. The percentage of transfers to 
an acute setting versus a non-acute setting varied across the diagnostic categories: 46.7% of 
short-stay transfers were to an acute setting among individuals with TBI, 38.9% among 
individuals with traumatic SCI, and 32.5% among individuals with stroke.
Short-Stay Transfers to Acute Care Setting—Short-stay transfer to an acute care 
setting rates ranged from 7.2% (stroke) to 12.3% (SCI) (Tables 1-3). Reasons for transfer to 
acute care differed across the diagnostic categories (Table 5). The only common reason for 
acute care admission was infection.
Of the short-stay transfers to acute care, 14.7% were identified as potentially preventable 
among those with stroke, 10.2% among those with TBI, and 3.8% among those with SCI. 
Among patients with stroke, 30.6% of the potentially preventable short-stay transfers were 
for dehydration and 26.8% were for heart failure. Among patients with TBI, 26.4% of the 
potentially preventable short-stay transfers were for dehydration and 26.4% were for 
bacterial pneumonia. Finally, among patients with traumatic SCI, 66.7% of the potentially 
preventable transfers were for bacterial pneumonia and 33.3% for urinary tract infections.
Short-Stay Transfers to Non-Acute Care Setting—Short-stay transfer to a non-acute 
care setting rates were 15.1% among individuals with stroke, 11.6% among individuals with 
TBI, and 19.3% among individuals with SCI (Tables 1-3). A majority of these transfers 
were to skilled nursing facilities (99.9% among individuals with stroke and individuals with 
TBI, 100% among individuals with SCI).
DISCUSSION
Program interruptions and short-stay transfers are considered undesirable inpatient 
rehabilitation outcomes by the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission with the potential 
to impact patient recovery and healthcare expenditures.3 In our sample of Medicare fee-for-
service beneficiaries, 0.9% of patients receiving rehabilitation following a stroke, 0.8% of 
patients receiving rehabilitation following TBI, and 1.4% of patients receiving rehabilitation 
following SCI experienced a program interruption; 22.3% of patients with stroke, 21.8% of 
patients with TBI, and 31.6% of patients with SCI had rehabilitation programs that ended in 
a short-stay transfer.
The program interruption rates observed in our sample demonstrate slight improvement over 
the most recently reported rates. In 2008, a 1.1% program interruption rate was reported for 
individuals with stroke9 and a 1.0% rate for individuals with TBI.10 Our observed 
2012-2013 rates were 0.9% for individuals with stroke and 0.8% for individuals with TBI. 
For individuals with SCI, the previously reported rates from 2010 were 2.2% for individuals

 who used a wheelchair for locomotion and 1.0%11 for those who were ambulatory. Our 
sample combined individuals who used a wheelchair and individuals who were ambulatory, 
and the resultant program interruption rate observed in 2012-2013 was 1.4%. Although it 
appears that program interruption rates may be improving, comparisons with the previously 
reported rates should be interpreted with caution. The previously reported rates represent 
patients from all payers,9-11 whereas our rates represent Medicare fee-for-service 
beneficiaries only. Patient characteristics, such as age, also differed between our sample and 
those included in previous reports, with our sample being older. On average, individuals in 
our sample with stroke were 5.9 years older, individuals with TBI were 24.9 years older, and 
individuals with SCI were 23.9 years older.9-11
Our findings indicate that almost all program interruptions are temporary transfers to an 
acute care hospital (versus another setting submitting claims to CMS). Readmission to an 
acute care setting increases healthcare expenditures.22 Among diagnoses commonly 
receiving post-acute care, rehospitalization for potentially preventable conditions doubles 
the cost for an episode of care.22 The additional hospitalization exposure is also associated 
with increased risk for adverse outcomes, such as functional decline,23 pressure ulcers,24 
thrombosis,25 in-hospital falls,26 hospital-acquired infections,27 and one-year mortality.28
To our knowledge, this study is the first to report descriptive statistics for short-stay transfers 
among individuals receiving inpatient rehabilitation following stroke, TBI, and traumatic 
SCI. Previous reports have focused on returns to acute care at any point during 
rehabilitation,5,14-16 not transfers to any institutional setting occurring prior to the average 
length of stay given the patient's case-mix group and comorbidity tier. The relatively high 
rates observed in our sample indicate that one-fifth to one-third of patients receiving 
inpatient rehabilitation following stroke, TBI, or traumatic SCI experience this outcome.
The overarching goal of CMS's quality initiative is to “build a healthcare delivery system 
that is better, smarter, and healthier.”29 The “Triple Aim” will be achieved by “improving 
the individual experience of care; improving the health of populations; and reducing the per 
capita costs of care for populations.”1 Reducing program interruptions and/or short-stay 
transfer rates could achieve all three aims. At the individual level, preventing program 
interruptions and short-stay transfers could improve the patient's experience of care. At the 
population level, reducing rates of program interruptions and short-stay transfers could 
improve the health of the inpatient rehabilitation population and reduce per capita healthcare 
costs. Reducing rates of program interruptions and short-stay transfers align with the 
overarching goal of CMS's quality initiative and warrant consideration as quality metrics. 
Publicly reporting these rates could improve patients’ and caregivers’ abilities to make 
informed decisions regarding inpatient rehabilitation.30 Informed decision-making is a key 
element of patient-centered care.
Program interruptions and short-stay transfers may be more reflective of quality of care than 
post-discharge readmissions, as these outcomes occur while the patient is under the care of 
the facility. Moreover, there are two unique requirements for inpatient rehabilitation care that 
ideally should minimize the need for patients to be transferred prior to completing their 
rehabilitation program: 1) facilities are responsible for pre-screening and selecting patients

 that are appropriate for intensive rehabilitation and 2) care must be provided in a medical 
setting under the supervision of a physician.2 Examining the destinations of and reasons for 
program interruptions and short-stay transfers is an important first step in evaluating the 
appropriateness of interruptions and transfers as provider quality performance measures.
Not all short-stay transfers represent “undesirable” outcomes. For example, patients may be 
transferred in order to be closer to family. In our sample, almost all short-stay transfers to a 
non-acute setting were to skilled nursing facilities. Skilled nursing facilities provide a lower 
level of rehabilitative care, but are not the ideal or desired discharge setting for patients 
admitted to an inpatient rehabilitation facility. This is recognized at the policy-level, and 
rates of discharge to skilled nursing facilities is one of the metrics the Medicare Payment 
Advisory Commission tracks and reports to Congress as an indicator of quality of care in the 
inpatient rehabilitation setting.3 Such transfers may be unavoidable, if for example, the 
patient's family determines they are no longer able to provide the support required for the 
patient to safely discharge to the community. Transfer to a skilled nursing facility would also 
be an appropriate outcome for a patient residing in a nursing facility prior to their 
hospitalization. The inpatient rehabilitation stay may have been a planned step in their 
recovery allowing them to safely return to their prior living setting. However, patients 
transferred from inpatient rehabilitation to skilled nursing facilities may also represent 
inappropriately selected patients, as the transfer may suggest these patients were either 
unable to tolerate intensive therapy or not achieving the expected functional gains. The 
Medicare Payment Advisory Committee reported variation in the rates of discharge to 
skilled nursing facilities across inpatient rehabilitation facilities,3 indicating there may be 
room for improvement on this outcome.
Nearly all program interruptions and one-third of short-stay transfers were returns to acute 
care. The reasons for return to acute care should be considered to determine if any are 
potentially preventable. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality has established a 
list of potentially preventable diagnoses. These diagnoses were identified by the Agency as 
“ambulatory care sensitive conditions”; conditions that should not occur under appropriate 
outpatient care.21 If the conditions are manageable under outpatient care, they should not 
have occurred under inpatient care. In our sample, approximately 12% of program 
interruptions and 14% of short-stay transfers to acute care were for potentially preventable 
conditions. These rates are relatively low and suggest inpatient rehabilitation facilities are 
performing well in preventing complications. However, given that more than one in ten of 
the rehospitalized patients returned to acute care for a potentially avoidable condition, there 
is still room for improvement.
Prevention of even a small percent of these rehospitalizations has the potential to impact a 
large number of patients. Readmissions that are potentially preventable are clear targets for 
care-improvement efforts. By tracking reasons for potentially preventable readmissions to 
acute care, providers may be able to implement targeted programs within their facilities and 
reduce patients’ risk of rehospitalization.
Although reducing rates of program interruptions and short-stay transfers to acute care may 
represent targets for care-improvement efforts, unintended consequences would need to be

 monitored. Unintended consequences are a concern with the implementation of any quality 
metric. A concern with measures related to hospital readmissions, such as program 
interruptions and short-stay transfers to acute care, is decreased access to care for more 
medically complex patients.31 Monitoring for unintended consequences will be important if 
these outcomes are selected for quality reporting.
Reducing rates of program interruptions and short-stay transfers will not just improve patient 
experiences of care, they will also likely translate to lower Medicare spending per 
beneficiary.32 This outcome will become increasingly important as bundled payment models 
are implemented. CMS is currently testing four bundled payment models in the Bundled 
Payments for Care Improvement initiative.33 Although the structures differ, all models place 
the accountable entity in charge of coordinating a patient's care across multiple providers 
and settings for “episodes of care” lasting 30, 60, or 90 days. Only one payment is made per 
episode, and providers must work together to deliver quality, cost-effective care within the 
constraints of the “bundled” payment.34 Preliminary findings from the Bundled Payments 
for Care Improvement initiative appear positive and CMS recently implemented mandatory 
bundled payments for lower extremity joint replacements in certain geographic areas.35,36 
As bundled payments become a reality, providers (hospitals) will be incentivized to partner 
with other providers who deliver efficient quality care, for example those with low program 
interruption and transfer rates. Our findings provide initial insight into the current rates of 
program interruptions and short-stay transfers among Medicare beneficiaries receiving 
inpatient rehabilitation following stroke, TBI, and traumatic SCI.
Limitations
A limitation when using administrative datasets is the lack of information regarding the 
consistency and accuracy of data entry.37 However, these datasets allow for the inclusion of 
a nationally representative sample, which is important for descriptive analyses. Our 
descriptive analyses were limited to individuals receiving inpatient rehabilitation in the early 
stages following stroke, TBI, or traumatic SCI. The findings may not be generalizable to 
individuals in the chronic phases of these conditions or to patients receiving rehabilitative 
care for other diagnoses.
Another consideration is our use of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's list of 
potentially preventable diagnoses. These diagnoses were developed for identifying 
potentially preventable acute care admissions among individuals under outpatient care, not 
among patients in an inpatient setting. Potentially preventable hospital readmission measures 
for patients under the care of inpatient rehabilitation facilities are currently under 
development and build on the Agency's list.38 Future research will benefit from the 
availability of a list of potentially preventable diagnoses developed for this specific 
population.
There are limitations associated with our definition of a program interruption as “a three day 
or less claim from another inpatient provider occurring during an inpatient rehabilitation 
stay”. Program interruptions do not always generate claims, as a patient may have briefly 
discharged home or to another non-Medicare covered setting. Therefore, we may have 
underestimated rates of program interruptions.

 The descriptive statistics reported represent the Medicare-fee-for service population. This 
population is older than the average TBI and traumatic SCI populations receiving inpatient 
rehabilitation, and results should be interpreted accordingly.10,11 Additionally, we are using 
Medicare defined outcomes (i.e. “program interruption” and “short-stay transfer”). These 
outcomes may not be viewed as adverse by all patients, providers, and payers. However, 
these outcomes were selected because they represent potential targets for improving the care 
of Medicare beneficiaries. A final consideration is that our analyses are descriptive only; 
conclusions cannot be drawn regarding patient- and facility-level predictors of program 
interruptions and short-stay transfers.
Conclusions
Our findings indicate that program interruptions and short-stay transfers represent targets for 
care-improvement efforts among Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries receiving inpatient 
rehabilitation following stroke, TBI, and SCI. Future research focused on identifying 
modifiable risk factors for these outcomes will allow for targeted preventative interventions. 
Further research is also needed in other patient populations. Importantly, longitudinal 
analyses should be conducted to observe trends in program interruptions and short-stay 
transfers as policy and payment reforms are implemented.
