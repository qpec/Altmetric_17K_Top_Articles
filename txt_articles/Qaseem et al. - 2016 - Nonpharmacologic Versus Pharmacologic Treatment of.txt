 Nonpharmacologic Versus Pharmacologic Treatment of Adult Patients
With Major Depressive Disorder: A Clinical Practice Guideline From the
American College of Physicians
Amir Qaseem, MD, PhD, MHA; Michael J. Barry, MD; and Devan Kansagara, MD, MCR, for the Clinical Guidelines Committee of
the American College of Physicians
Description: The American College of Physicians (ACP) devel-
oped this guideline to present the evidence and provide clinical
recommendations on the comparative effectiveness of treatment
with second-generation antidepressants versus nonpharmaco-
logic treatments for major depressive disorder in adults.
Methods: This guideline is based on a systematic review of pub-
lished, English-language, randomized, controlled trials from
1990 through September 2015 identified using several data-
bases and through hand searches of references of relevant stud-
ies. Interventions evaluated include psychotherapies, comple-
mentary and alternative medicines (including acupuncture, �-3
fatty acids, S-adenosyl-L-methionine, St. John's wort [Hypericum
perforatum]), exercise, and second-generation antidepressants.
Evaluated outcomes included response, remission, functional
capacity, quality of life, reduction of suicidality or hospitalizations,
and harms. The target audience for this guideline includes all
clinicians, and the target patient population includes adults with
major depressive disorder. This guideline grades the evidence
and recommendations using ACP's clinical practice guidelines
grading system.
Recommendation: ACP recommends that clinicians select be-
tween either cognitive behavioral therapy or second-generation
antidepressants to treat patients with major depressive disorder
after discussing treatment effects, adverse effect profiles, cost,
accessibility, and preferences with the patient (Grade: strong rec-
ommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

epressive disorders are a major health care issue
and one of the foremost causes of disability in
adults around the world, resulting in significant costs to
society and health care systems (1). The estimated eco-
nomic burden associated with depression was $83.1
billion in 2000 and is probably higher today (2). De-
pressive disorders include major depressive disorder
(MDD); dysthymia; and subsyndromal depression, in-
cluding minor depression. Major depressive disorder is
the most prevalent depressive disorder, with an esti-
mated lifetime prevalence of 16% in the United States
(3). An average of 8 million ambulatory care visits per
year result in a primary diagnosis of MDD (4). The
American Psychiatric Association (5) defines MDD as
depressed mood or loss of pleasure or interest along
with other symptoms, including significant change in
weight or appetite, insomnia or hypersomnia, psy-
chomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day, fa-
tigue or loss of energy, feelings of worthlessness or
excessive or inappropriate guilt, indecisiveness or de-
creased ability to concentrate, and recurrent thoughts
of death or suicide, that last for at least 2 weeks and
affect normal functioning. Dysthymia is less severe, but
symptoms last for 2 or more years. In contrast, subsyn-
dromal depression is associated with less severe symp-
toms of depression that do not qualify for MDD or dys-
thymia diagnoses.
The treatment of depression can be characterized
by 3 phases (Figure 1): acute (6 to 12 weeks), continu-
ation (4 to 9 months), and maintenance (≥1 year) (7).
Relapse is defined as the return of depressive symp-
toms during the acute or continuation phases and is
therefore considered part of the same depressive epi-
sode, whereas recurrence is defined as the return of
depressive symptoms during the maintenance phase
and is considered a new, distinct episode. Response to
treatment (typically defined as ≥50% reduction in mea-
sured severity) can be quantified using various tools,
such as the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) (7)
or the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) (8).
Various treatment approaches can be used to man-
age MDD, such as psychotherapy, complementary and
alternative medicine (CAM), exercise, and pharmaco-
therapy. The psychological interventions used to treat

 depression include acceptance and commitment ther-
apy, cognitive therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy
(CBT),
interpersonal
therapy,
and
psychodynamic
therapies (Table 1). The CAM treatments include acu-
puncture, meditation, �-3 fatty acids, S-adenosyl-L-
methionine (SAMe), St. John's wort, and yoga. Exercise
includes a broad range of activities that can be done
for varying durations, in classes, individually, or in infor-
mal groups. For pharmacologic therapy, the scope of
this guideline is limited to second-generation anti-
depressants (SGAs) (selective serotonin reuptake inhib-
itors, serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors,
and selective serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhib-
itors). First-generation antidepressants (tricyclic anti-
depressants and monoamine oxidase inhibitors) are
very rarely used because SGAs have lower toxicity in
overdose than first-generation antidepressants and
similar efficacy.
GUIDELINE FOCUS AND TARGET POPULATION
The purpose of this guideline from the American
College of Physicians (ACP) is to summarize and grade
the evidence on the comparative effectiveness and
safety of nonpharmacologic treatments and SGAs (in-
cluding serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin norepi-
nephrine reuptake inhibitors, bupropion, mirtazapine,
nefazodone, and trazodone), alone or in combination,
for MDD. The target audience for this guideline in-
cludes all clinicians, and the target patient population
includes all adults with MDD. These recommendations
are based on a background evidence article (9) and a
systematic evidence review sponsored by the Agency
for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) (6).
METHODS
Systematic Review of the Evidence
The systematic evidence review was conducted by
the AHRQ's RTI International–University of North Caro-
lina at Chapel Hill Evidence-based Practice Center (6).
Additional methodological details can be found in the
Appendix (available at www.annals.org), accompany-
ing background evidence article (9), and full report (6).
Reviewers searched several databases for studies pub-
lished in English, German, or Italian from 1 January
1990 through September 2015. Studies on efficacy
were limited to randomized, controlled trials and sys-
tematic reviews and meta-analyses, although evidence
on harms included observational studies. Reviewers
combined data when possible using meta-analysis and
assessed the risk of bias and quality of studies accord-
ing to established methods. The study population in-
cluded adult outpatients (aged ≥18 years) with MDD

 during either an initial or a second treatment attempt
who did not remit after an initial adequate trial with an
SGA.
The review evaluated the following classes of inter-
ventions: depression-focused psychotherapy, CAM, ex-
ercise, and SGAs. Outcomes assessed included bene-
fits in response (often defined as ≥50% improvement in
HAM-D scores), remission (often defined as a HAM-D
score ≤7), speed of response, speed of remission, re-
lapse, quality of life, functional capacity (as assessed by
various scales), reduction of suicidality, or reduction of
hospitalization. Harms assessed included overall ad-
verse events, withdrawals because of adverse events,
serious adverse events, and specific adverse events.
Quality of life, functional status, suicidality, and hospi-
talizations were rarely reported.
Grading the Evidence and Developing
Recommendations
This guideline was developed by the ACP Clinical
Guidelines Committee according to the ACP guideline
development process, which has been described (10).
The Clinical Guidelines Committee used the evidence
tables in the accompanying systematic review and full
report (9) when reporting the evidence and graded the
recommendations using ACP's guideline grading sys-
tem (Table 2).
Peer Review
The AHRQ evidence review was sent to invited
peer reviewers and posted on the AHRQ Web site for
public comments. The guideline was peer-reviewed
through the journal and was posted online for com-
ments from ACP Governors and Regents.
COMPARATIVE BENEFITS OF PHARMACOLOGIC
VERSUS NONPHARMACOLOGIC TREATMENT
OPTIONS FOR INITIAL MANAGEMENT
Refer to Appendix Table 1 (available at www.annals
.org) and the accompanying systematic review (9) for
additional details of the evidence.
SGA Versus Psychological Interventions
SGA Versus CBT
Monotherapy.
Moderate-quality evidence from 5
trials (11–15) showed no difference in response when
comparing SGAs (fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine,
or sertraline) with CBT in patients with MDD after 8 to
52 weeks of treatment. Low-quality evidence from 3 tri-
als (11, 14, 15) showed no difference between remis-
sion rates (fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and paroxetine) and
functional capacity (14) (fluvoxamine and paroxetine)
for SGAs compared with CBT.
Combination Therapy. Low-quality evidence from
2 trials (14, 16) showed no difference in response or
remission when comparing monotherapy using SGAs
(escitalopram, fluvoxamine, or paroxetine) with combi-
nation therapy using SGAs plus CBT (problem-solving
therapy or telephone-based CBT) in patients with MDD
after 12 to 52 weeks of treatment. Low-quality evidence
from 2 trials (14, 16) assessed function, and 1 trial
showed that patients who received the combination
therapy reported more improvement on 3 of 5 work-
functioning measures than those who received SGA
monotherapy, although clinically important differences
on these measures are uncertain.
SGA Versus Interpersonal Therapy
Monotherapy.
Low-quality evidence showed no
difference in response (1 trial; escitalopram) (17) or re-
mission (2 trials; citalopram, escitalopram, or sertraline)
(17, 18) for SGAs compared with interpersonal therapy
for patients with MDD after 12 weeks of treatment.
Combination Therapy. Low-quality evidence from
1 trial (19) showed increased remission for SGA mono-
therapy compared with SGA combined with interper-
sonal therapy (with nefazodone) in patients with MDD
after 12 weeks of treatment.
SGA Versus Psychodynamic Therapies
Monotherapy.
Low-quality evidence from 1 trial
(20) showed no difference in remission for fluoxetine
compared with psychodynamic monotherapy in pa-
tients with MDD after 16 weeks of treatment. Low-
quality evidence from 2 trials (20, 21) showed few dif-
ferences in functional capacity between the treatments.
Combination Therapy. Low-quality evidence from
1 trial (21) showed no difference in functional capacity
for SGA monotherapy compared with SGA plus psy-
chodynamic combination therapy.
SGA Versus CAM Interventions
SGA Versus Acupuncture
Monotherapy.
Low-quality evidence from 2 trials
(22, 23) showed no difference in treatment response
when
comparing
fluoxetine
with
acupuncture
monotherapy for patients with MDD after 6 weeks of
treatment.
Combination Therapy. Low-quality evidence from
2 trials (24, 25) showed that combination therapy of
SGAs with acupuncture improved treatment response
compared with monotherapy with SGAs (fluoxetine or
paroxetine) in patients with MDD after 6 weeks of treat-
ment. However, low-quality evidence from 1 trial (24)
showed no difference in remission when comparing
paroxetine monotherapy with paroxetine plus acupunc-
ture combination therapy.

 SGA Versus ω-3 Fatty Acids
Monotherapy. Low-quality evidence from network
meta-analysis showed that SGAs (fluoxetine) were asso-
ciated with a greater response than �-3 fatty acids in
patients with MDD.
SGA Versus SAMe
Monotherapy. Low-quality evidence from network
meta-analysis showed no difference in response be-
tween treatment with escitalopram and SAMe in pa-
tients with MDD after 12 weeks of treatment.
SGA Versus St. John's Wort
Monotherapy.
Low-quality evidence from 9 trials
(26–34) showed no difference in response or remission
(26, 27, 33–35) when comparing treatment using SGAs
with St. John's wort in patients with MDD after 4 to 12
weeks of treatment. Levels of SGAs used in the compar-
ative effectiveness studies with St. John's wort were
capped at levels lower than usual dosing ranges in
comparative studies. Thus, this evidence is rated as low
quality.
SGA Versus Yoga
The evidence is insufficient to compare SGAs with
meditation or yoga because there were no eligible
trials.
SGA Versus Exercise
Monotherapy. Low-quality evidence from network
meta-analysis showed no difference in response for
SGAs versus exercise. Moderate-quality evidence from
2 trials (36, 37) showed no difference in remission for
sertraline compared with exercise in patients with MDD
after 16 weeks of treatment.
Combination Therapy. Low-quality evidence from
1 trial (38, 39) showed no difference in remission for
treatment with sertraline compared with combination
therapy of sertraline and exercise in patients with MDD
after 16 weeks of treatment.
COMPARATIVE EFFECTIVENESS OF SWITCHING
OR AUGMENTING STRATEGIES INVOLVING
SGAS
Refer to Appendix Table 2 (available at www.annals
.org) and the accompanying systematic review (9) for
additional details of the evidence.
Switching to Other SGAs
Moderate-quality evidence from 1 trial (40) showed
no difference in response when switching from 1 SGA
to another (bupropion vs. sertraline or venlafaxine and
sertraline vs. venlafaxine). Low-quality evidence from 1
trial (40) showed no difference in remission (bupropion
vs. sertraline or venlafaxine and sertraline vs. venlafax-
ine) or depression severity (venlafaxine vs. citalopram)
when switching from 1 SGA to another.
Low-quality evidence showed no difference in risk
for overall adverse events, discontinuation due to seri-
ous adverse events, overall discontinuation rates, or
suicidal thoughts associated with switching to venlafax-
ine versus switching to citalopram (40, 41).
Switching From an SGA to a Different SGA
Versus Switching to Cognitive Therapy
Low-quality evidence from 1 trial (42) showed no
difference in response or remission when switching
from 1 SGA to another (sertraline, bupropion, or venla-
faxine) compared with switching to cognitive therapy.
Low-quality evidence also showed no difference in
discontinuation due to adverse events when switching
from 1 SGA (citalopram) to another (sertraline, bupro-
pion, or venlafaxine) compared with switching to cog-
nitive therapy (42).
Augmenting With Another SGA
Low-quality evidence from 1 trial (43) showed no
difference in response or remission for augmentation
of citalopram treatment with bupropion compared with
augmentation with buspirone. However, augmenting
with bupropion decreases depression severity more
than augmentation with buspirone (43).
Low-quality evidence showed no difference in sui-
cidal ideas and behavior or serious adverse events, and
moderate-quality evidence showed that discontinua-
tion due to adverse events was lower with bupropion
than with buspirone (43).
Augmenting With Another SGA Versus
Augmenting With Cognitive Therapy
Low-quality evidence from 1 trial (43) showed no
difference in response, remission, or depression sever-
ity for augmentation of citalopram treatment with an-
other SGA (bupropion or buspirone) versus augmenta-
tion with cognitive therapy.
Low-quality evidence showed no difference be-
tween augmenting with bupropion or buspirone for se-
rious adverse events or discontinuation due to adverse
events (43).

crease in discontinuation due to adverse events with
SGAs compared with CBT at 8 to 14 weeks of follow-up.
Combination Therapy. Low-quality evidence from

 CBT. Low-quality evidence showed a non–statistically
significant increase in discontinuation due to adverse
events with SGAs compared with CBT (14, 16).
SGA Versus Interpersonal Therapy
Monotherapy. The evidence is insufficient to deter-
mine the comparative risk of treatment with SGAs ver-
sus interpersonal therapy.
Combination Therapy. Low-quality evidence from
1 trial (19) showed no difference in overall discontinu-
ation rates for treatment with nefazodone versus a com-
bination of nefazodone and interpersonal therapy.
SGA Versus Third-Wave CBT
Low-quality evidence from 2 trials (15, 45) showed
that overall discontinuation rates and discontinuation
due to adverse events were higher in patients treated
with SGAs than with third-wave CBT.
SGA Versus Psychodynamic Therapies
Monotherapy.
Low-quality evidence from 1 trial
showed no difference between SGAs and psychody-
namic therapy for suicidality at 96 weeks of follow-up
(21) or overall discontinuation rates at 8 to 16 weeks
(20, 46, 47), 48 weeks (20), or 96 weeks (21) of
follow-up.
Combination Therapy. Low-quality evidence from
1 trial (21) showed that overall discontinuation rates
were lower for patients treated with fluoxetine than for
those treated with fluoxetine combined with psychody-
namic therapy. Low-quality evidence from 1 trial (21)
showed a non–statistically significant increase in suicid-
ality when comparing SGAs with a combination of
SGAs and psychodynamic therapy after 96 weeks of
follow-up.
SGA Versus CAM Interventions
SGA Versus Acupuncture
Monotherapy.
Moderate-quality evidence from a
systematic review of 21 trials (48) showed that the over-
all risk for adverse events is higher with SGAs than with
acupuncture.
Combination Therapy. Low-quality evidence from
1 trial showed no difference in risk for overall adverse
events (49), and low-quality evidence from 2 trials
showed no difference in overall discontinuation rates
(24, 25) or discontinuation due to adverse events (24,
49) for SGA monotherapy versus a combination of SGA
plus acupuncture.
SGA Versus ω-3 Fatty Acids
Monotherapy.
Low-quality evidence from 1 trial
(50) showed no difference in overall discontinuation
rates of treatment using SGAs compared with �-3 fatty
acids.
Combination Therapy. Low-quality evidence from
2 trials (51, 52) showed no difference in overall discon-
tinuation rates for SGA monotherapy compared with
combination therapy of SGAs plus �-3 fatty acids.
SGA Versus SAMe
Monotherapy.
Low-quality evidence from 1 trial
(52) showed no difference in overall discontinuation
rates between treatment with SGAs or SAMe.
SGA Versus St. John's Wort
Monotherapy.
Moderate-quality evidence from 9
trials (25–29, 31–33, 53) showed increased risks for dis-
continuation and discontinuation due to adverse events
with SGAs compared with St. John's wort. Moderate-
quality evidence from 8 trials (27, 29–34, 54) also
showed a non–statistically significant increase in the risk
for overall adverse events with SGAs compared with St.
John's wort. Low-quality evidence from 4 trials (27, 30,
31, 34) showed no difference in serious adverse events
with SGAs compared with St. John's wort.
SGA Versus Yoga
The evidence is insufficient to compare SGAs with
meditation or yoga because there were no eligible
trials.
SGA Versus Exercise
Monotherapy.
Low-quality evidence from 2 trials
(36, 38) showed that sertraline was associated with an
increased risk for discontinuation due to adverse ef-
fects compared with exercise, although both had simi-
lar overall discontinuation rates.
Combination Therapy.
Low-quality evidence from
1 trial (38) showed no difference in overall discontinu-
ation rates or discontinuation due to adverse events for
sertraline monotherapy compared with combination
therapy of sertraline plus exercise.
VARIATION IN RISKS FOR BENEFITS AND
HARMS BY SEVERITY OF MDD
The evidence is inconclusive about whether MDD
severity is a predictor of the risk for harms, serious ad-
verse events, or discontinuation of treatment.
COMPARATIVE BENEFITS AND RISKS FOR
HARMS FOR SELECTED SUBGROUPS
For demographic characteristics, no trials assessed
the difference in benefits or harms between sexes or by
race/ethnicity. For accompanying psychiatric symp-
toms, no trials assessed coexisting anxiety, insomnia,
low energy, or somatization.
Low-quality evidence from 1 trial (54) showed no
difference in response rates, overall adverse events, or
discontinuation due to adverse effects when compar-
ing treatment using SGAs with St. John's wort in older
adults (aged 60 to 80 years).

treatments in patients with MDD. Moderate-quality evi-
dence showed no difference in response or discontin-
uation of treatment when comparing SGAs with CBT.
Patients are often treated for depression by pri-
mary care physicians who frequently prescribe SGAs
(55, 56). A previous systematic review and the 2008
ACP guideline (57, 58) have shown similar safety and
efficacy among the different SGAs. Most patients do
not achieve remission after initial treatment with SGAs
(59), in which case switching therapies or augmenting
with additional interventions may be warranted. Table
3 summarizes the typical duration, dosages, and com-
parative adverse effects associated with SGAs (60).
Adverse effects commonly associated with SGAs
include constipation, diarrhea, dizziness, headache, in-
somnia, nausea, sexual adverse events, and somno-
lence (58). Adverse effects associated with St. John's
wort include gastrointestinal symptoms, dizziness or
confusion, and fatigue or sedation.
For second-line treatment after unsuccessful treat-
ment with SGAs, low-quality evidence showed that
strategies to switch to or augment with another drug or
nonpharmacologic therapy are similarly effective. Most
evidence came from the STAR*D (Sequenced Treat-
ment Alternatives to Relieve Depression) study (40, 42,
43).
Data on population subgroups were limited; how-
ever, in older persons, St. John's wort was equally ef-
fective and had similar rates of adverse events com-
pared with SGAs (low-quality evidence). Evidence was
insufficient to determine whether depression severity
was a modulator of treatment efficacy or harms.
ST. JOHN'S WORT
Low-quality evidence showed that St. John's wort
may be as effective as SGAs for treating MDD, and
moderate-quality evidence showed that St. John's wort
was better tolerated than SGAs. However, St. John's
wort is not currently regulated by the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration, and there is no current standard
in place about the contents and potency of the medi-
cation. Therefore, patients in the United States may not
be able to get a quality-controlled medication or reli-
ably obtain preparations with similar effectiveness as
those used in the included studies. Adverse effects as-
sociated with St. John's wort may include mild gastro-
intestinal symptoms, skin reactions, fatigue, sedation,
restlessness, dizziness, headache, and dry mouth (61,
62). St. John's wort is associated with important drug–
drug interactions and is known to induce cytochrome
P450 isoenzyme 3A4 (63). It may reduce the bioavail-
ability or efficacy of some drugs, such as oral contra-
ceptives and immunosuppressants, and is contraindi-
cated in patients receiving monoamine oxidase or
serotonin reuptake inhibitors (64–66).
RECOMMENDATION
Recommendation: ACP recommends that clinicians
select between either cognitive behavioral therapy or
second-generation antidepressants to treat patients
with major depressive disorder after discussing treat-
ment effects, adverse effect profiles, cost, accessibility,
and preferences with the patient. (Grade: strong recom-
mendation, moderate-quality evidence)
Moderate-quality evidence shows that CBT and
SGAs
are
similarly
effective
treatments
for
MDD.
Moderate-quality evidence suggests that discontinua-
tion rates are similar for CBT and SGAs, although dis-
continuation due to adverse events is non–statistically
significantly increased with SGAs. However, harms as-
sociated with SGAs are probably underrepresented in
the included trials. Thus, we conclude that CBT has no
more—and probably fewer—adverse effects than SGAs.
In addition, lower relapse rates have been reported
with CBT than SGAs (11, 15). Although SGAs are often
initially prescribed for patients with depression, CBT is
a reasonable approach for initial treatment and should
be strongly considered as an alternative treatment to

 SGAs where available. Further, there are reported dif-
ferences among SGAs in mild (constipation, diarrhea,
dizziness, headache, insomnia, nausea, and somno-
lence) to major (sexual dysfunction and suicidality) ad-
verse effects. Bupropion is associated with a lower rate
of sexual adverse events than fluoxetine and sertraline,
whereas paroxetine has higher rates of sexual dysfunc-
tion than fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, nefazodone, and ser-
traline (57). Physicians and patients should discuss ad-
verse event profiles before selecting a medication.
Figure 2 summarizes the recommendations and
clinical considerations.

Summary of the American College of Physicians Guideline on Nonpharmacologic Versus Pharmacologic Treatment With Second-Generation Antidepressants
for Adult Patients With Major Depressive Disorder
Disease/Condition
Major depressive disorder
Target Audience
Internists, family physicians, and other clinicians
Target Patient Population
Adults with major depressive disorder
Interventions Evaluated
Second generation antidepressants; psychotherapies for treating depression; and complementary and alternative medicines, 
including acupuncture, ω
ω-3 fatty acids, S-adenosyl-L-methionine, St. John’s wort (Hypercium perforatum), and exercise 
Outcomes Evaluated
Response, remission, functional capacity, quality of life, reduction of suicidality or hospitalizations, and harms
Benefits 
Response and remission from depression and increased functional capacity
Rates were similar when comparing different treatment methods to SGAs with the exception of the following:
   increased functional capacity for SGA + CBT combination therapy vs. SGA monotherapy;
   increased remission for SGA + IT combination therapy vs. SGA monotherapy;
   increased response for SGA + acupuncture combination therapy vs. SGA monotherapy; and
   increased response for SGA vs. ω-3 fatty acids monotherapy.
Harms 
SGAs: constipation, diarrhea, dizziness, headache, insomnia, nausea, sexual adverse events, and somnolence
Psychotherapies: sparsely reported
St. John’s wort: gastrointestinal symptoms, dizziness or confusion, and tiredness or sedation
Exercise: none reported
Similar rates of adverse events and discontinuation of treatment were noted when comparing different treatment methods
with the exception of the following:
   increased overall discontinuation of treatment with SGA compared to CBT monotherapy;
   increased overall discontinuation of treatment with SGA + PSYD combination therapy vs. SGA monotherapy;
   increased overall discontinuation of treatment and discontinuation due to adverse events with SGA vs. third-wave CBT 
      monotherapy;
   increased overall risk of adverse events with SGA vs. acupuncture; 
   increased discontinuation of treatment, and discontinuation of treatment due to adverse events with SGA vs. St. John’s wort; 
      and
   increased discontinuation of treatment due to adverse events with SGA vs. exercise.
Recommendations
Recommendation: ACP recommends that clinicians select between either cognitive behavioral therapy or second-
generation antidepressants to treat patients with major depressive disorder after discussing treatment effects, adverse 
effect profiles, cost, accessibility, and preferences with the patient. (Grade: strong recommendation, moderate-quality 
evidence) 
Clinical Considerations
Preparations of St. John’s wort differ widely, and there are currently no standards for purity or potency in the United States. 
The evidence on efficacy is limited to preparations used in the included studies.
St. John’s wort is associated with drug–drug interactions and is known to induce CYP 3A4.
CBT = cognitive behavioral therapy; CYP 3A4 = cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 3A4; IT = interpersonal therapy; PSYD = psychodynamic therapy;
SGA = second-generation antidepressant.

 INCONCLUSIVE AREAS OF EVIDENCE
Evidence was insufficient to determine the compar-
ative effectiveness of SGAs to third-wave CBT. Further,
there was insufficient evidence to determine the com-
parative harms of SGAs versus monotherapy using in-
terpersonal therapy or combination therapy with SGAs.
For second-line therapy of switching or augmentation
strategies, no studies directly compared SGAs with
CAM or exercise. No studies directly compared switch-
ing versus augmentation strategies. Evidence was in-
sufficient to determine whether the comparative effec-
tiveness of SGAs to other treatments is a function of
disease severity, and there were limited data on assess-
ing the efficacy of treatments for MDD based on the
subgroups of populations. In addition, there is insuffi-
cient evidence about the applicability of studies of St.
John's wort to patients in the United States, especially
about the purity and potency of St. John's wort prepa-
rations available in this country.

APPENDIX: DETAILED METHODS
The evidence review was conducted by the AH-
RQ's RTI International–University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill Evidence-based Practice Center. Details of
the ACP guideline development process can be found
in ACP's methods paper (10).
Key Questions Addressed
Key Question 1a: In adult patients with MDD who
are attempting initial treatment, what is the effective-
ness of SGA monotherapy compared with either non-
pharmacologic monotherapy or combination therapy
(involving nonpharmacologic treatments alone or in
combination with an SGA)?
Key Question 1b: Does comparative treatment ef-
fectiveness vary by MDD severity?
Key Question 2a: In adult patients with MDD who
did not achieve remission after an initial adequate trial
with 1 SGA, what is the comparative effectiveness of
second-line therapies?
Key Question 2b: Does comparative treatment ef-
fectiveness vary by MDD severity?
Key Question 3a: In adult patients with MDD, what
are the comparative risks for harms of these treatment
options for those attempting initial treatment or those
who did not achieve remission after an initial adequate
trial with an SGA?
Key Question 3b: Do the comparative risks for
treatment harms vary by MDD severity?
Key Question 4: Do the benefits and risks for harms
of these treatment options differ by subgroups of pa-
tients with MDD defined by common accompanying
psychiatric symptoms (coexisting anxiety, insomnia, low
energy, or somatization) or demographic characteris-
tics (age, sex, race, or ethnicity)?
The Clinical Guidelines Committee was particularly
interested in comparative effectiveness of treatment ac-
cording to MDD severity (key questions 1b, 2b, and 3b)
because depression screening is becoming more wide-
spread, which will tend to increase the proportion of
patients being diagnosed with milder MDD.
Search Strategy
Reviewers
searched
MEDLINE
(via
PubMed),
EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, AMED, PsycINFO, and
CINAHL from 1 January 1990 through September 2015
for studies in English, German, or Italian. Studies on
efficacy were limited to randomized, controlled trials
and systematic reviews and meta-analyses, although
evidence on harms included observational studies. For
additional information, including inclusion and exclu-
sion criteria, refer to the accompanying systematic re-
view (9) and the full evidence report sponsored by
AHRQ (6). Further, there were no limitations on study
duration or length of follow-up.
Meta-analysis and Network Meta-analysis
Direct comparisons were made using meta-analytic
techniques. Network meta-analysis was used when
there was a lack of studies on direct comparisons. The
reviewers used a hierarchical frequentist approach and
random-effects models, including placebo- and active-
controlled randomized, controlled trials that were ho-
mogenous in study populations and outcome assess-
ments and were part of a connected network (67, 68).
Quality Assessment
The quality of studies was assessed using the
AHRQ handbook (69). The risk of bias for studies was
assessed using AHRQ guidance (70) and the Cochrane
Risk of Bias tool (71). Tests for publication bias had low
sensitivity because of the small number of studies. This
guideline rates the evidence and recommendations us-
ing ACP's guideline grading system (Table 1).
Population
The population included adult outpatients (aged
≥18 years) with MDD during either an initial or a sec-
ond treatment attempt who did not remit after an initial
adequate trial with an SGA.
Interventions Evaluated
The
interventions
evaluated
are
as
follows:
depression-focused psychotherapy; CAM, including
acupuncture, meditation (for example, mindfulness-
based stress reduction), �-3 fatty acids, SAMe, St.
John's wort (Hypericum perforatum), and yoga; exer-
cise; and SGAs, including bupropion, citalopram, des-
venlafaxine, duloxetine, fluoxetine, escitalopram, flu-
voxamine, levomilnacipran, mirtazapine, nefazodone,
paroxetine,
sertraline,
trazodone,
venlafaxine,
vila-
zodone, and vortioxetine. Drugs evaluated for combi-

 nation or augmentation therapies included atypical
antipsychotics (aripiprazole, asenapine maleate, cloza-
pine,
iloperidone,
lurasidone,
olanzapine,
paliperi-
done, quetiapine, risperidone, and ziprasidone), psy-
chostimulants
(amphetamine–dextroamphetamine,
armodafinil, dexmethylphenidate, dextroamphetamine,
lisdexamfetamine, methylphenidate, and modafinil),
buspirone, L-thyroxine (T4), lithium, and pindolol tri-
iodothyronine (T3).
Comparators
The SGAs were compared with monotherapy that
involved nonpharmacologic interventions or combina-
tion therapies of SGAs and nonpharmacologic inter-
ventions. To assess second-line treatment, modifica-
tions of initial treatment with SGAs were compared with
nonpharmacologic interventions; other pharmacologic
interventions, including CAM; or combinations of non-
pharmacologic and pharmacologic strategies as either
switches to new treatment or augmentation of existing
therapy.
Outcomes
Benefits assessed included response (often de-
fined as ≥50% improvement in HAM-D scores), remis-
sion (often defined as a HAM-D score ≤7), speed of
response, speed of remission, relapse, quality of life,
functional capacity (as assessed by various scales), re-
duction of suicidality, or reduction of hospitalization.
Quality of life, functional status, suicidality, and hospi-
talizations were rarely reported.
Harms assessed included overall adverse events,
withdrawals because of adverse events, serious ad-
verse events, specific adverse events (including hypo-
natremia, seizures, suicidality, hepatotoxicity, weight
gain, gastrointestinal symptoms, and sexual adverse
events),
withdrawals
because
of
specific
adverse
events, or drug interactions.
Target Audience
The target audience for this guideline includes
all clinicians, patients, health system leaders, and
policymakers.
Target Patient Population
The target patient population includes all adults
with MDD.
Peer Review
The AHRQ evidence review was sent to invited
peer reviewers and posted on the AHRQ Web site for
public comments. The guideline underwent a peer-
review process through the journal and was posted on-
line for comments from ACP Governors and Regents.
