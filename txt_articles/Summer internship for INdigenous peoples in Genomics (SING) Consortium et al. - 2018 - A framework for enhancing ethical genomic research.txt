Integration of genomic technology into healthcare settings establishes new capabilities to
predict disease susceptibility and optimize treatment regimes. Yet, Indigenous peoples
remain starkly underrepresented in genetic and clinical health research and are unlikely to
benefit from such efforts. To foster collaboration with Indigenous communities, we propose
six principles for ethical engagement in genomic research: understand existing regulations,
foster collaboration, build cultural competency, improve research transparency, support
capacity building, and disseminate research findings. Inclusion of underrepresented com-
munities in genomic research has the potential to expand our understanding of genomic
influences on health and improve clinical approaches for all populations.
T
he integration of genomics into healthcare has advanced the ability of researchers and
clinicians to predict disease susceptibility and optimize treatment regimens that have the
potential to reduce the risk of certain diseases. Routine genome sequencing has become
possible with the expanded availability and affordability of next-generation sequencing tech-
nology. Recent initiatives such as the All of Us research program seek to advance health data
integration by collecting genetic information and medical and lifestyle histories from one million
individuals (https://allofus.nih.gov/). However, Indigenous peoples, including American Indians
(AI), Alaska Natives (AN), and Native Hawaiians (NH), remain underrepresented and under-
studied in genetic and clinical health research1–3, despite facing disproportionately higher rates
of cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer, diabetes, and infectious disease compared with non-
Hispanic whites4,5. Large-scale research consortia such as the eMERGE Network, CSER, and the
International HapMap consortia6–8 have successfully recruited only few, if any, Indigenous
individuals despite attempts to achieve a representative sample. In fact, despite a numerical
increase in participants, the percentage of Indigenous people represented in genome-wide
association studies worldwide decreased from 0.06% to 0.05% between 2009 and 20161,9. As
such, they are less likely to benefit from genomic research seeking to elucidate the biological

 etiology of disease, which could aid in disease prevention and
treatment and reduce future healthcare disparities10.
Globally, Indigenous people are underrepresented in genomic
research studies for a variety of reasons including researchers’
failure to engage Indigenous communities in ethical and inclusive
ways, lack of study transparency, and historical and recent
research malpractice11–13, all of which have sowed mistrust and
justified peoples’ unwillingness to share personal health infor-
mation, including DNA, with the research community. We briefly
describe two examples of research misconduct and lapses in
research ethics. First, the Human Genome Diversity Project
(HGDP) and subsequent large-scale efforts such as the National
Genographic Project began as endeavors to study worldwide
human genetic diversity and global migration patterns. However,
these projects failed to fully consider the damaging social and
political implications to Indigenous communities that, in the case
of the HGDP, prompted strong resistance by the Indigenous
Peoples’ Council on Biocolonialism (http://www.ipcb.org/) and
tarnished future trust in research and researchers14–16. Second, the
Havasupai Tribe filed a lawsuit against the Arizona Board of
Regents over lack of informed consent and a violation of civil
rights in addition to unapproved genetic research with DNA
samples17–19. The case raised awareness of cultural and political
sensitivities around what constitutes appropriate research20.
These two examples have raised concerns about the negative
impacts that research harms (e.g., stigmatization, violation of
individuals’ rights, lack of benefit, and cultural incongruence) can
have on Indigenous communities.
Despite decades of scientific transgressions across the globe,
many Indigenous communities worldwide continue to be inter-
ested in genetic research. Some Indigenous communities have
developed their own policies to promote responsible conduct of
research and have created research review boards to implement
mechanisms of accountability that position themselves as part-
ners in research. Some voices within biomedical research have
advocated for approaches centered on creating active roles for
research participants, community consultation, and research
transparency with Indigenous communities—themes embedded
in
a
community-based
participatory
research
(CBPR)
approach14,21–23. In one case, the San people of Southern Africa,
who have been a focal point of genetic research for over 60 years
(more recently with a focus on whole-genome studies)24–26,
issued a code of ethics in early 2017 for researchers conducting
studies with their communities27. This step was prompted by
concerns over the use of insulting terminology in reference to the
community, failure to communicate findings to the community,
direct recruitment without governance authority, and a lack of
investment in the community28,29. In other cases, research
guidelines such as Te Mata Ira: Guidelines for Genomic Research
with Maori in New Zealand and the Human Heredity and Health
(H3Africa) Guidelines for Community Engagement in Africa have
empowered Indigenous communities to seek positive outcomes
from genomic research30–32. Furthermore, the Navajo Nation in
the United States (US) has begun to develop a strong cultur-
allyinformed genetic research policy in place of an existing 16-
year moratorium on genetic research33. Importantly, these
emerging guidelines arose from active and frequent commu-
nication between researchers (including Indigenous researchers)
and community members over many years comprised of multiple
training workshops, community meetings, and development of
digital and print informational materials. Such efforts to bridge
the divide between genomic research and Indigenous peoples will
likely alleviate tensions and concerns34. While these examples
highlight the ongoing concerns of global Indigenous commu-
nities, we offer potential solutions to achieve greater equity in
genetic research.
The six principles
Ethical framework. As Indigenous scientists and allies of the
Summer internship for INdigenous peoples in Genomics (SING)
Consortium35 and also as members of our own tribal commu-
nities, we recognize the potential for Indigenous communities to
benefit from genomic research. Over the past 2 years, we devel-
oped this framework in which we propose the following set of
principles (Fig. 1 and Table 1), informed by CBPR approaches, to
engage Indigenous people and communities in genomic research.
This framework includes six principles: (1) understand existing
regulations, (2) foster collaboration, (3) build cultural compe-
tency, (4) improve transparency, (5) support capacity, and (6)
disseminate research findings. The goals of the framework are to
build trust, increase inclusion of diverse groups in genomic
research, and enhance ethical research practices that promote
tribal research regulations (e.g., tribal oversight and consultation)
and benefits to participants and their communities. Our ethical
framework extends beyond the current US federal requirements
for biomedical and behavioral research (as described by the
recently revised Common Rule36), which draws upon the prin-
ciples of bioethics (respect for persons, beneficence, and justice
from the Belmont Report), and community-engaged research.
Although we focus primarily on Indigenous groups of the US
(AI, AN, and NH), this framework can inform research practices
in many Indigenous communities to incorporate cultural views
and acknowledge local research review boards. Few studies have
engaged Indigenous communities in genomic research, yet some
supportive research collaborations guided by CBPR principles
have been ongoing for decades and can serve as examples of what
is possible. We illustrate the principles listed below with examples
of genetic research with tribes, and highlight how studies have
effectively incorporated some of the principles that we present in
our ethical framework. Thus, we provide this framework to
promote inclusion of historically underrepresented communities

Fig. 1 An ethical framework for enhancing genomic research with
Indigenous communities. The recognition of tribal sovereignty and research
regulations are at the core of our ethical framework. Moving outward from
the center, community engagement is necessary to build a foundation to
create a collaborative partnership among researchers and community
members. Starting from the right going clockwise, researchers should
incorporate cultural competency, transparency, capacity building, and
dissemination strategies to build trust, increase inclusion of diverse groups
in genomic research, and enhance ethical research practices. The diagonal
words represent core values that should be used throughout the research

 in future genomic research, which will expand genomic and
health knowledge for diverse populations37,38.
Understand tribal sovereignty and research regulation. Within
the US, interactions between researchers and Indigenous people
require attention to political considerations as well as the ethical
considerations described above. We focus on AI/AN tribes in the
US and recognize they are distinct from other underrepresented
minorities and global Indigenous groups in that the US govern-
ment recognizes tribes as domestic-dependent nations and many
tribal nations function as sovereign entities (i.e., an autonomous
government with the authority to govern and uphold a range of
laws including research codes)39; however, Native Hawaiians and
some US-based tribes remain unrecognized at the state and fed-
eral levels40,41. In research endeavors involving AI/AN tribes or
tribal members, researchers must recognize any existing tribal
sovereignty or local governance structures (e.g., the local laws and
regulations) before engaging in research42. This recognition
should be extended to all Indigenous groups regardless of federal
or state recognition, as they are distinct and cohesive commu-
nities who possess their own social and cultural infrastructures.
Many tribes have regulatory research review structures that may
include their community-guided Institutional Review Board (IRB)
(e.g., tribal, Indian Health Service (IHS), or healthcare corporation
IRB) or tribal councils from which researchers will have to seek
approval in addition to their university IRBs. The local review
boards (e.g., community IRB or committee) oversee research
protocols and may dictate the types of required consent, data and
sample usage, and dissemination of research findings in particular
communities. Within the US, there are currently 25 IRBs serving
tribes and urban Indian communities that are registered with the
US Department of Health and Human Services (https://www.ihs.
gov/dper/research/hsrp/instreviewboards/). Some IRBs, such as
the intertribal Rocky Mountain/Great Plains Tribal Region IRB
have created rigorous regulations that promote Indigenous values
and community participation for collaborating researchers and
serve multiple independent tribes43. There is strong support
among tribes for “data-sharing procedures that take into account
tribal sovereignty and appropriate oversight of research,”44 which
would be under the purview of the tribal IRBs or research review
boards. Policies relating to biospecimen handling and ownership,
data storage, and the ultimate return or destruction of samples
should be developed early in the research process in collaboration
with the local oversight structures.
Engage and collaborate with the tribal community. To best
promote respectful and mutually beneficial research, it is
important to recognize the role of historical and current social,
political, economic, and environmental influences on health. A
comprehensive approach to research that utilizes elements of
“community-based research” (also known as community-engaged
research) integrates many of these factors45,46. Community-based
approaches have enhanced research with diverse populations in
public health and the social sciences, and the approach has also
been endorsed by researchers, funding agencies, and national
organizations47. Utilizing these approaches, researchers can
carefully design studies to build long-term partnerships/colla-
borations that acknowledge Indigenous peoples’ longstanding
knowledge systems and tribal sovereignty (if applicable), account
for variables within studies that are not obvious to researchers,
and honor Indigenous community values in a culturally respectful
manner.
Engaging the community in research can occur at various levels
and take many forms. To facilitate community involvement, it is
crucial to develop an engagement plan for the research study
before its onset and to develop engagement activities for all phases
of research. Discussing all aspects of a research study with
Indigenous community members and involving them, from the
conceptual design to data analysis to the conclusions, can
positively impact the research by identifying priority topic areas
and questions that are relevant to the community. This, in turn,
can generate innovative ideas, more robust hypotheses, and
reduce scientific biases. Integrating Indigenous knowledge and
perspectives in the research process could be particularly valuable
for the analysis, interpretation, and dissemination of the study
results.
Building relationships with community members throughout
the study increases the likelihood of successfully completing the
study and the possibility of developing subsequent long-term
partnerships. Collaboration builds trust and can enhance research
participation throughout the study’s duration. In some tribal
partnerships, one favorable engagement activity has been to
implement a tribal advisory council that meets regularly to
provide feedback about the ongoing studies and fosters educa-
tional opportunities for all participating entities48.

 The Center for Alaska Native Health Research (CANHR) team
incorporated principles of CBPR throughout the initiation and
development of their center, with researchers initially generating
the questions and then approaching the community partners to
determine which questions were of interest49. The research
questions, study methodology, and dissemination plan were
continually refined to reflect community interests through an
iterative process of communication and collaboration with a
community advisory group (CAG) that ultimately settled on
investigations of obesity and diabetes. In particular, the genetic
component of the study necessitated the creation of a space for
discussing genetic topics between tribal partners and CANHR
researchers. The research team utilized the Genetic Education for
Native Americans program to conduct a 2-day workshop about
basic cell biology, risks and benefits of genetic research, and
cultural considerations50. The resulting strong collaborative
relationship is essential to the longstanding success of the
CANHR partnership with tribal communities.
Build cultural competency. Cultural competency is the ability to
acknowledge, communicate, and understand cultural differences
while interacting effectively with individuals across cultures.
Striving to attain cultural competency is essential for researchers
to work toward understanding a community’s cultural values and
norms. Researchers should enter Indigenous communities with
humility, empathy, and willingness to listen and learn. Without
adequate cultural competency in a research project, Indigenous
communities may feel that their perspectives and knowledge are
devalued or not respected. In particular with biological specimen
collection, many Indigenous groups feel that their blood and
other tissue samples remain contiguous with the spiritual and
physical person throughout their life51. In addition, under-
standing the social, cultural, and structural determinants of health
within Indigenous communities (e.g., poverty, barriers to edu-
cation and employment, and cultural traditions that foster resi-
liency) is important for contextualizing interactions with the
community, creating project objectives, interpreting results, and
conducting culturally sustainable science. Therefore, sensitivity to
community values, worldviews, restrictions, social circumstances,
and the social and economic structures must be practiced when
proposing a genomic research study.
Cultural competency also entails working alongside partners
with different skills and worldviews. Spending time in the
community and being visibly present, through formal research
planning meetings and participation in community events, is
critical to understand their perspectives, questions, and concerns
and for developing relationships. These interactive approaches
may allow researchers to identify an appropriate cultural adviser
who can aid in navigating the community dynamics. Various
resources exist for cultural competency and ethics training for
researchers intending to engage with Indigenous communities.
There are online and in-person resources for cultural competency
training through the Association of American Medical Colleges
Tool for Assessing Cultural Competence Training (TACCT). In
addition, the National Congress of American Indians (NCAI) AI/
AN Genetics Resource Guide (http://genetics.ncai.org) and the
Collaborative Research Center for American Indian Health
(CRCAIH) offer guidance for researchers to orient themselves
to the broader tribal perspective52. More recently, the Ethics
Training for Health in Indigenous Communities Study (ETHICS)
created an alternative training option through the online
Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI) research
ethics training course that is tailored for federally-funded
researchers working with AI/AN communities53. Building a
culturally-adept foundation demonstrates respect and enables
bidirectional communication, which can further fulfill commu-
nity needs and provide an indigenized perspective for future
research projects.
An example of cultural competency integration in research is
found in the Northwest-Alaska Pharmacogenomics Research
Network (NWA-PGRN), a collaborative partnership between
various research institutions and tribal organizations to study and
improve drug response in AI/AN people54. The NWA-PGRN
established a CAG within each of its participating tribal
communities to initiate research on genomic-pharmaceutical
drug interactions48,55. Central to this collaboration was a
bidirectional flow of knowledge: CAG members instructed
researchers in cultural competency, traditional knowledge, and
science, while researchers conducted workshops and presenta-
tions on pharmacogenetics in a community setting (e.g., in
the local community rather than at a research institution).
Improve transparency of research practices. Academic and
community goals often differ, necessitating open communication
between researchers and community members. To promote
transparency, researchers should strive for clarity about the
project’s goals in project documents (e.g., research protocol,
recruitment materials, consent forms, research results, etc.) and
use accessible language. Ideally, the materials should be deliber-
ated upon and approved by community partners and their local
review committees before they are disseminated, then revised
with feedback as appropriate. Many Indigenous communities
may decide to participate in research for the perceived benefits,
even if the benefits are not yet realized. As such, researchers must
be careful to avoid over-promising benefits from their studies. For
example, results that are generated from genomic research often
takes years to interpret and disseminate in ways that allow
communities to benefit. Even if a new genetic test is produced, it
may not offer a health benefit without proper treatment and
prevention in place. In addition, if research goals change during
the study, it is necessary to keep the community informed. When
collected data spurs new hypotheses, the community should be
engaged in the formulation of new research directions. To build
understanding and trust, community partners can be invited into
the laboratory and shown where samples are stored, how they are
processed, and how the data are generated. Finally, the antici-
pated future use of data, samples, and long-term ownership/sto-
rage of sequence data must be discussed thoroughly before the
study begins. To formalize partnerships, there are various
examples of potential agreements such as a Memorandum of
Understanding that should be considered by all parties involved
and the future disposition of data and samples defined in a
Materials Transfer Agreement or Data Sharing Agreement.
Ethical concerns and lack of transparency led some academic
institutions to initiate moratoriums on research of archived
Indigenous materials, as occurred at the Australian National
University in the 1990s. Following this decision, the National
Center for Indigenous Genomics (http://ncig.anu.edu.au/) was
created in 2013 to regulate archived materials and promote
genomic research of benefit to Indigenous Australians. The Center
is under Indigenous governance, composed of an Indigenous-
majority
Board,
who
ensures
Indigenous
custodianship
of
biological samples, proper engagement, insight into research
directions and programming, and dissemination of information.
Build tribal research capacity. Building tribal research capacity
by which Indigenous scientists can lead research that is directly
aligned with community values is essential for long-term cultu-
rally sustainable science. From 2004–2014, the percentages of
doctoral degrees awarded annually in science and engineering to

 Indigenous people in the US was less than 0.4% (in 2014, 110 AI/
AN and 33 NH out of 38,939 nationwide were awarded doctoral
degrees), which highlights the disparity in the number of trained
Indigenous researchers56,57. The participation of Indigenous
people and other underrepresented minority populations in Sci-
ence, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) fields
remains shockingly low, and Indigenous students often face
various barriers that preclude them from pursuing or continuing
careers in STEM fields57, such as inadequate academic prepara-
tion, competing family or cultural demands, conflicting epis-
temologies, income barriers, and poor mentorship. Allies in
leadership positions at academic and federal institutions can play
an important role in building research capacity to increase
training opportunities for Indigenous scientists to conduct health
and genomic studies within their communities. Therefore, the
research community should actively work to continually train,
engage, mentor, and support emerging Indigenous scientists from
the trainee level to beyond the early career scientist stage.
Further tensions surrounding genomic research may stem from a
disconnect between scientists and the Indigenous communities
involved in research. Around the world, social and economic
inequities have contributed to the lack of recruitment and inclusion
of Indigenous people in genomic studies, education, and training.
Indigenous people are more likely to live in locations distant from
the universities and institutions conducting the research and thus
may have less experience working with researchers. In closing this
divide, Indigenous scientists can act as cultural brokers and serve as
liaisons
between
their
communities
and
academic
research
institutions with a capacity to lead future projects. Ultimately, a
critical mass of Indigenous scientists can become self-sustaining,
providing beneficial impact within both the broader scientific
community and their own communities.
Building research capacity within Indigenous communities
strengthens inclusivity in biomedical research and promotes the
use of culturally appropriate frameworks. Inclusion of commu-
nity and Indigenous researchers can bring greater transparency of
the research process to Indigenous communities and provide
training opportunities for them to become involved in the
research. Those seeking guidance beyond local tribal governance
may also contact the newly appointed Director of Tribal Health
Research Office, which coordinates NIH research related to the
health of AI/AN across the NIH Institutes, Centers, and Offices,
and recently released a Tribal Consultation Policy (https://dpcpsi.
nih.gov/thro).
An example of a study that has built research capacity in tribal
communities is the Strong Heart Study (SHS). SHS was founded in
1988 to investigate CVD among 12 participating tribes across the
country and stands as the largest epidemiological study to date
among AIs and the second longest running study of CVD in the
US58. Recent investigations focus on identifying genetic risk factors
of CVD in participating families recruited from health centers
and academic institutions59–61. To build trust across these distinct
communities, SHS investigators worked closely with community
leaders to identify specific questions of interest within the scope of
the study and hired community members to work within the study
group. Consequently, SHS maintains 90% retention rates across
study phases and has incorporated dozens of AI/AN investigators
who participate in active research teams, including the training of
many Indigenous PhDs, MDs, nurses, and other medical profes-
sionals from tribal communities62. SHS has served as an important
model for collaborative efforts with Indigenous groups.
Disseminate
findings
in
a
community-accessible
format.
Research findings are usually published in academic journals, yet
the publications are rarely accessible to Indigenous communities
nor do they tend to enter the community discourse, thus limiting
the impact to community knowledge and benefit. Soliciting
community input regarding best practices to disseminate research
findings to participating and affected communities can reverse this
trend. Broadening the format of disseminated research results
using creative solutions offers community partners greater access
to the materials (e.g., digital storytelling, community newsletters or
reports, social media, radio, and small grassroots interventions).
For example, rural AN communities have used digital storytelling
(culturallyimmersed videos) to share knowledge about health
promotion and cancer awareness within their community63.
Inspired by TED Talks, video-based content has also been
developed through RED Talks, an online YouTube channel
designed to share solution-based ideas, tribal research and policies,
and success stories across tribes. With access to such information,
communities can generate tool kits and further policies.
Acknowledging the contributions of community partners is
imperative for strengthening partnerships. Researchers can do this
by inviting community members who contributed in meaningful
ways to the research process to be co-authors or acknowledging
their contributions in publications, disseminated materials, or
presentations. Lack of acknowledgment actively disengages partner
communities from the research process, removing their insight,
efforts, and work in the research process. At a minimum,
communities should be included in the acknowledgements to
indicate their central role in all completed studies. Ownership of the
study is thus transferred back to the community while instilling
added confidence in future research endeavors.
Our framework considerations are multifaceted and inter-
connected. Each research study will have different levels of
collaboration and be unique in its own way. Depending on the
Indigenous community, some research projects may need to
apply only a few of the principles outlined above. Ultimately, the
study goals and the dynamics of the community–researcher
partnership will evolve throughout the duration of the project.
Application of these principles, as demonstrated by collaborative
genomic research projects such as those between the White
Mountain Apache and the National Institutes of Health64, or the
Maori tribes in New Zealand and the University of Otago (https://
www.otago.ac.nz/full-circle/), suggest that research programs
between Indigenous people and scientific communities can
flourish when commitment and transparency are prioritized.
Future directions
The suggested framework requires deliberate investments in time
and effort by researchers and Indigenous collaborators. Building
strong and equal partnerships is necessary for establishing long-
lasting successful relationships that have the potential to greatly
benefit future research endeavors. Acknowledging the commitment
required to incorporate these ethical principles of genetic research in
Indigenous communities means new supportive policies and sub-
stantial investments from federal agencies and institutions will be
necessary. Given that diversity in research is a top priority for many
agencies and universities65,66, their commitment to this effort must
be demonstrated by actions that enable and facilitate our framework
for underrepresented communities. Without such policies, entire
communities of Indigenous people will continue to be ignored,
despite research programs’ best intentions.
Moving forward, genomic research partnerships between aca-
demic institutions and Indigenous peoples can be fostered by
viewing participating groups as collaborators instead of research
subjects. Presently, with the new All of Us research program,
technological advancements, and increased awareness of enligh-
tened research approaches, we have the opportunity to usher in an
era of widespread respectful and beneficial research that has the

 potential to truly engage Indigenous and other underrepresented
populations in genomic research. This framework offers an
opportunity for researchers to begin working with Indigenous
communities, which provides a richness of discoveries that are both
scientifically and ethically motivated. As ethical researchers, we
must strive to incorporate the presented framework into the current
research paradigm and undertake this challenge of collaborating
and engaging with Indigenous communities to address the health
challenges faced by these communities. More broadly, other Indi-
genous communities can choose to use this framework to promote
stronger engagement so that the benefits from scientific advances
are distributed more meaningfully and equitably.
