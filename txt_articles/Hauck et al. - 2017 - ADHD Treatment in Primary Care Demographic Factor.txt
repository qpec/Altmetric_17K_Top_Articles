Abstract
Background: The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence and characteristics of youth with attention-deficit
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in Ontario, Canada, and to determine the predictors of psychotropic medication prescrip-
tions in youth with ADHD.
Method: This is a cross-sectional retrospective chart abstraction of more than 250 000 medical records from youth aged 1 to
24 years in a large geographical region in Ontario, Canada, linked to population-based health administrative data. A total of
10 000 charts were randomly selected and manually reviewed using predetermined criteria for ADHD and comorbidities.
Prevalence, comorbidities, demographic indicators, and health service utilization characteristics were calculated. Predictors of
treatment characteristics were determined using logistic regression modelling.
Results: The prevalence of ADHD was 5.4% (7.9% males, 2.7% females). Youth with ADHD had significant psychiatric
comorbidities. The majority (70.0%) of ADHD patients received prescriptions for stimulant or nonstimulant ADHD medi-
cation. Antipsychotic prescriptions were provided to 11.9% of ADHD patients versus 0.9% of patients without ADHD.
Antidepressant prescriptions were provided to 19.8% versus 5.4% of patients with and without ADHD, respectively.
Predictors of antidepressant prescriptions were increasing age (odds ratio [OR], 1.14; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.07 to
1.21), psychiatric consultation (OR, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.16 to 3.58), and diagnoses of both anxiety and depression (OR, 18.4; 95%
CI, 8.03 to 42.1), whereas the only predictor of antipsychotic prescriptions was psychiatric consultation (OR, 3.85; 95% CI,
2.11 to 7.02).
Conclusions: Youth with ADHD have more psychiatric comorbidities than youth without ADHD. The majority of youth
with ADHD received stimulant medications, and a significant number received additional psychotropic medications, with
psychiatric consultation predicting medication use.

If mental health is “the leading children’s health problem
today,”1 Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)
is of particular concern given that ADHD has a significant
impact on functional outcomes,2,3 and its prevalence appears
to be increasing.4 To promote the health of children with
ADHD, it is important to understand the prevalence of both
this diagnosis and associated comorbidities and the factors
that determine treatment outcomes. ADHD treatment can be
challenging for clinicians, as first-line treatment involves the
use of stimulant medications, which may be abused and pose
the risk of psychosis (although rare).5,6 Beyond drug misuse
and serious adverse effects, there is considerable variability
in how ADHD is treated, including the use of off-label,
nonstimulant medication, such as antipsychotics.7 A com-
parison of guidelines between the United States and the
United Kingdom indicates that American guidelines (Amer-
ican Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry) suggest
“medications not FDA approved” as a treatment option if
first-line treatment fails in preschool children, whereas the
United Kingdom (National Institute for Health and Care
Excellence) guidelines say, “drug treatment is not
recommended” in preschool children who do not respond
to first-line treatment.8
Despite the widespread use of antipsychotics for ADHD,
the evidence for their use is sparse. Risperidone has a mod-
erate impact on certain behaviours in youth with ADHD,9,10
such as oppositional and aggressive behavior, but there is
limited evidence to support the use of other antipsychotic
medications, and they are not indicated for the core
symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity.11 There are lim-
ited data concerning longer-term efficacy of antipsychotics
for disruptive behavior and appropriate timelines for discon-
tinuation.11 A recent study revealed that children with
ADHD who are prescribed antipsychotics have higher health
care resource use than children who are not prescribed such
medications.12 ADHD is common, and the treatment for
ADHD appears to be highly varied and includes medications
such as atypical antipsychotics, for which there is little evi-
dence of benefit and substantial evidence of potential harm
(weight gain, dyslipidemia, extrapyramidal side effects).13
Consequently, it is important to understand why these med-
ications are being used. Population-based primary care data
are a good source of information for understanding the cir-
cumstances in which nonstimulant medications are being
used to treat ADHD.
The objective of this study was to determine the preva-
lence of ADHD and to compare demographic, comorbidity,
health service utilization, and medication use between
ADHD and non-ADHD subjects. We also evaluated predic-
tors of nonstimulant medication use among children and
youth with ADHD.
Methods
Data Sources and Chart Abstraction
At the time of this study, there were more than 250 000
patients contained in the previously described Electronic
394
The Canadian Journal of Psychiatry 62(6)
 Medical Record Administrative data Linked Database
(EMRALD) primary care electronic medical record data
set.14 EMRALD is a collection of data from family physi-
cians in Ontario and includes the contents of medical charts,
such as test results, prescriptions, visit notes, consultation
correspondence, and notes about the patients’ medical his-
tory. Selection criteria (described in Figure 1) were applied,
resulting in 29 256 children and youth patients who met
eligibility criteria of persons aged 1 to 24 years. Of these,
10 000 were randomly selected and were individually read
and manually abstracted for 9 mental health diagnoses by
trained abstractors. A medical expert (T.S.H.) reviewed all
definite and possible cases of ADHD and adjudicated ques-
tionable cases. ADHD diagnosis was abstracted from
EMRALD, as were consultations with paediatricians, psy-
chiatrists, psychologists, and social workers available in the
entire chart. Comorbid diagnoses (alcohol abuse, anxiety,
depression, autism/Asperger’s, bipolar disorder, drug abuse,
eating disorders, and psychotic disorders) were also
abstracted at the same time as ADHD diagnoses.
The 10 000 abstracted charts were linked to population-
based administrative health records housed at the Institute
for Clinical Evaluative Sciences (ICES). ICES is an inde-
pendent, nonprofit research organization that holds
population-level data, including administrative data, for the
purpose of evaluating health care services and their effec-
tiveness in Ontario. Patient-level records in these data are
linked to each other with a unique encoded identifier using
the Registered Persons Database (RPDB) for every Ontario
resident with an assigned health card number. The RPDB
was used to measure demographic variables such as age,
neighbourhood income quintile (derived from Statistics
Canada Census data), and rural residence. Income quintile
measures household income and adjusts for household size
and community size (quintile 1 is the lowest income). This is
derived by linking the postal code of the patient to national
Canadian census data. Rurality is an indicator of the size of
the patient’s community, where a community smaller than
10 000 people is defined as being rural. The Ontario Health
Insurance Plan (OHIP) lists medical service billings by
Ontario physicians since 1991 and was used to measure
visits to family doctors, psychiatrists, paediatricians, and
neurologists (family doctors include general practitioners).
As children and youth may be in the electronic medical
record (EMR) for variable amounts of time, the duration of
OHIP eligibility was assessed. The Canadian Institute for
Health Information–National Ambulatory Care Reporting
System (CIHI-NACRS), includes patient-level details on
hospital visits and community-based ambulatory care, out-
patient clinics, day surgery, and emergency department (ED)
visits since 2002 and provided information on the number of
ED visits. The look-back period for family physician (gen-
eral practitioner) billings was 1 year from the look-back date
of April 1, 2012. The look-back period for specialist billings
and health service use was 10 years from the same date
(April 1, 2012).
Subjects
As illustrated in Figure 1, inclusion criteria were applied
prior to randomly selecting the 10 000 EMRALD subjects.
Inclusion criteria included the following: age of 1 to 24 years
as of December 31, 2011, valid date of birth, rostered/regis-
tered with a family doctor, active/practicing physician who
has used an EMR for more than 2 years, patient alive at the
time the EMR data were extracted, and patient present in the
EMR for at least 1 year. Within the EMRALD database,
ADHD cases were ascertained by applying predetermined
selection criteria developed by the EMRALD team consist-
ing of both family doctors and psychiatrists. Definite cases
of ADHD were charts in which the family physician
recorded a diagnosis of attention-deficit disorder/ADHD, if
a neuropsychological test or report indicated a diagnosis, or
if correspondence from a school/school board indicated a
diagnosis of ADHD. All other EMRALD subjects were
controls. The ascertainment of ADHD resulted in a
prevalence-based cohort. We were not able to determine the
date of first ADHD diagnosis within the EMR data, as the
diagnosis may have occurred prior to the start of the EMR
record and diagnosis dates were not consistently recorded.
Outcomes
For the ADHD prevalence objective, the outcome was a
diagnosis of ADHD (and these subjects were compared with
youth with no ADHD diagnosis). For the nonstimulant or
adjuvant treatment ADHD treatment objective, the primary
outcomes were prescriptions for antipsychotics and antide-
pressants from the family physician.

 Covariates
We measured demographic characteristics such as age, sex,
neighbourhood income quintile (using census data), and
rural residence. We also measured visits with paediatricians,
psychiatrists, and neurologists in the previous 10-year period
based on OHIP billings. OHIP billings were used to deter-
mine the number of total, mental health–related, and non–
mental health–related family physician visits in the past
year. Mental health– and non–mental health–related
physician visits were distinguished based on a validated
algorithm.15 We measured the number of ED visits in the
past 10-year period for psychiatric and nonpsychiatric rea-
sons. Psychiatric ED visits were those in which the reason
for visit ICD10 diagnosis was F00 to F99 OR X60-X84;
nonpsychiatric ED visits were ED visits for any other diag-
nosis. Finally, we measured notes and consultation letters
(social workers, paediatricians, psychiatrists, and psycholo-
gists) available from the EMRALD medical chart.
Statistical Analyses
Continuous data were summarized using means, standard
deviations, and medians. Categorical data were summarized
using frequencies and percentages. Patient demographics
and health service use between the ADHD and non-ADHD
cohort were compared by using a chi-squared test for cate-
gorical variables and 1-way analysis of variance for contin-
uous variables.
Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate the
factors that influenced whether an ADHD patient received a
prescription drug (antipsychotics or antidepressants).
Explanatory variables included patient and geographic char-
acteristics and frequency of health care services use. During
the model-building process, a univariate analysis was
performed for each variable to evaluate significance for
inclusion into the model. Variables that were hypothesized
a priori to have clinical relevance were also included in the
final multivariable regression model. All analyses were
performed using SAS statistical software (version 9.4, SAS
Institute Inc., Cary, NC).
Results
Demographics
Abstraction yielded 540 definite cases of ADHD; 4 of these
cases were rejected during confirmation or adjudication,
resulting in a final ADHD sample of 536 subjects (99.3%
agreement) and an overall prevalence of 5.4% (7.9% males,
2.7% females), as seen in Supplementary Table 1. Individu-
als diagnosed with ADHD were older than those without
ADHD, and boys in particular acquired the diagnosis with
increasing age, with noticeable increases in prevalence
among boys 14 to 17 years (11.7%) versus girls (4.9%;
Suppl. Table 1). There were no significant differences in
income distribution or rural residence between those with
and without an ADHD diagnosis (Suppl. Table 2). Addi-
tional measures of socioeconomic status and marginalization
were not significantly different between those with and with-
out ADHD and are not shown.
Health Service Use
Children and youth with ADHD had significantly more visits
to family doctors for mental health–related conditions but
not more visits for non–mental health–conditions (Suppl.
Table 3). They also had significantly greater psychiatrist and
paediatrician visits, although not neurology visits (Table 1).
Patients with ADHD were much more likely to visit a psy-
chiatrist more than twice in 10 years (27.7% for males with
ADHD versus 3.2% for males without ADHD). ED visits for
psychiatric conditions were low throughout the sample, but
youth with ADHD were more likely to visit an ED for non-
psychiatric conditions, and 62.6% of youth with ADHD ver-
sus 48.9% of males without ADHD visited an ED for
nonpsychiatric reasons more than twice in 10 years.
Consultations available in the EMR were significantly
higher for youth with ADHD for paediatricians, psychia-
trists, psychologists, and social workers, with 23.5% of
males without ADHD having a paediatric consultation ver-
sus 50.4% with the diagnosis (Table 1). The burden of
comorbid psychiatric illness was much higher in the cases
with ADHD, and rates of alcohol abuse, anxiety, depression,
autism spectrum disorder, bipolar disorder, and other drug
abuse were all significantly higher among youth with
ADHD. Eating disorders and psychotic disorders did not
vary significantly between the 2 groups. Anxiety was more
than 4 times more prevalent among youth with ADHD
(13.2% of males and 14.8% of females) compared with
youth without ADHD (3.3% of males and 4.4% of females;
Table 1).
Prescriptions
Table 2 shows prescriptions based on ADHD status. For all 4
classes of medications (antidepressants, antipsychotics,
ADHD medications, and benzodiazepines), ADHD patients
received significantly more prescriptions. Of the 64 patients
with ADHD who received a prescription for an antipsycho-
tic, 18 (28.1%) had no other mental health diagnoses based
on the chart abstraction.
Figure 2A shows the breakdown of antipsychotic pre-
scriptions by age and sex. Prescriptions are significantly
higher in individuals with a diagnosis of ADHD and increase
with age in both groups. The most prescribed antipsychotic
among individuals with a diagnosis of ADHD was
risperidone, and it represented 55.8% of antipsychotic
prescriptions. Among individuals without ADHD, the most
commonly prescribed antipsychotic was quetiapine, and it
represented 51.3% of antipsychotic prescriptions. Figure 2B
shows the breakdown of antidepressant prescriptions by age
and sex. Prescriptions for antidepressants are also

 significantly higher in individuals who have a diagnosis of
ADHD and increase with age regardless of diagnosis.
Of ADHD patients taking antidepressants, 7.5% had
received a prescription for bupropion (further breakdown
is not possible because the number of patients become too
small). In patients without ADHD, 0.4% received a prescrip-
tion for bupropion.
ADHD medications (stimulants and atomoxetine) were
routinely prescribed to individuals with a diagnosis of
ADHD (70.0%) and minimally prescribed to individuals
without a diagnosis of ADHD (0.5%) and did not vary
significantly by age or sex. Of patients with ADHD on a
stimulant, 50% received a prescription of a short-acting
stimulant and 81.1% received a prescription for a long-acting
stimulant. Of individuals with ADHD, 10.3% received a
prescription for atomoxetine. The numbers for patients with-
out a diagnosis of ADHD cannot be shown for atomoxetine
as the numbers of cases are too low.
In terms of polypharmacy, 25 individuals (4.7%) with
ADHD received prescriptions for at least 1 antidepres-
sant, antipsychotic, and ADHD medication in their elec-
tronic chart, whereas 5 or fewer individuals without an
ADHD diagnosis received prescriptions for all 3 classes
of medication.
Logistic Regression Models
The outcomes of the regression modeling were predictors for
receiving an antipsychotic prescription and receiving an
antidepressant prescription among the ADHD population.

 Univariate analyses were performed for the following pre-
dictors: age, sex, rural residence, consultations in the EMR
(social worker, psychiatrist, psychologist, paediatrician),
psychiatric comorbidities (anxiety and depression, anxiety,
depression, autism, bipolar disorder, drug abuse, psychotic
disorder, alcohol abuse, eating disorder), income by quintile,
GP visits (overall, mental health), specialist billings (psy-
chiatry, paediatrics, neurology), and ED visits (psychiatric,
nonpsychiatric). Based on the univariate parameters, a priori
hypothesis, and sample size limits,16 a common multivariate
model was developed that included age, sex, consultation
with a psychiatrist, income quintile, and ED visits for psy-
chiatric conditions as predictors. Results are shown in Table 3.
Antipsychotic prescriptions were significantly associated with
psychiatric consultation (odds ratio [OR], 3.85; 95% confi-
dence interval [CI], 2.11 to 7.02). Antidepressant prescrip-
tions were also associated with psychiatric consultation
(OR, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.16 to 3.58) as well as comorbidities
of both depression and anxiety (OR, 18.4; 95% CI, 8.03 to
42.1) and increasing age (OR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.07 to 1.21).
Discussion
Our study revealed an overall ADHD prevalence of 5.4%,
with a higher prevalence in males, but not females, in older
cohorts, although the reasons for higher prevalence in older
age categories are unclear. There were no statistically sig-
nificant differences in income or rural versus urban resi-
dence between those with and without a diagnosis of
ADHD. In terms of health service use, individuals with a
diagnosis of ADHD were more likely to visit their general
practitioner or family physician, particularly for mental
health conditions. Compared with individuals without
ADHD, ADHD patients had overall higher health service
utilization, including specialist consultations, and had a
higher burden of psychiatric comorbidities. A substantial
number of individuals with ADHD received antipsychotic
medications (with the majority of prescriptions for risperi-
done) and antidepressants. Increasing age, diagnoses of both
anxiety and depression, and seeing a psychiatrist were fac-
tors for predicting antidepressant prescriptions, whereas only
consultation with a psychiatrist predicted antipsychotic
prescriptions.
The prevalence found in this study is comparable
to national and international prevalence for ADHD,
particularly with respect to meta-analyses of ADHD
prevalence.1,17-27 The patterns of medication use are also
very similar to studies conducted in Canada and the United
States28,29 and confirm that the number of prescriptions is
high even in a diverse study of youth across Ontario. This
study also confirms, in the form of health care and ED visits,
that patients with ADHD require greater health care
resources than those without the disorder.12 Given the known
socioeconomic determinants of health,1 it is surprising that
income quintile was not significantly associated with ADHD
diagnosis and not predictive of prescriptions. However,
recent literature suggests that ADHD is increasing similarly
in both the general population and children receiving Sup-
plemental Security Income,30 and past studies have not
found an association between poverty or socioeconomic sta-
tus and mental illness or ADHD diagnosis.31,32 However,
summary health statistics show that ADHD is more common
among children of single mothers, black children, and chil-
dren identified as “poor.”33 It is also possible that socioeco-
nomic factors simultaneously increase prescriptions (when
children without psychosocial supports are encouraged to
use medications for behavioural control) or decrease pre-
scriptions (if these children have a lower chance of affording
these drugs, which are not covered by the provincial health
plan), and such factors may complicate a possible
association.
Antipsychotic medications are prescribed for ADHD
and for other psychiatric diagnoses in children and youth,34
and a recent Canadian study identified the prevalence of
antipsychotic combination therapy to be 10.8%.28 In the
United States, a recent study showed that antipsychotics
were used in addition to stimulant medications in 5.8% to
6.8% of children and adolescents.35 A recent follow-up
study of children with severe ADHD who did not respond
to behaviour therapy showed rates of antipsychotic use as
high as 13.4%.36 In the United States, ADHD was the most
common diagnosis among children and youth treated with
antipsychotics,37 and nearly 1 in 5 children on Medicaid
with ADHD are treated with antipsychotics and long-acting
stimulants concurrently.29
With respect to antidepressants, predictors of prescrip-
tions in this study included age, psychiatric consultation, and
a diagnosis of both anxiety and depression. It is reasonable
that older individuals in this cohort, with multiple comorbid-
ities, would be prescribed such medications. Anxiety and
depression are more common among the youth with ADHD,
and these are indications for the prescribed antidepressant
medications.
More than 1 in 10 individuals with ADHD received a
prescription for an antipsychotic medication, numbers that
are similar to those recently reported elsewhere.28,36 Risper-
idone is the most commonly prescribed antipsychotic in this
population, and it has the most evidence for use in ADHD.11
The multivariable regression model did not show that age,
sex, or income predict antipsychotic prescriptions. While
previous studies have identified socioeconomic predictors
of health service use such as single-parent families,38 a
recent study also failed to find a relationship between service
use and factors such as neighbourhood advantage and care-
giver education level.39 In this study, the only predictor
found for antipsychotics was psychiatric consultation (OR,
3.85; 95% CI, 2.11 to 7.02), which is surprising. Psychosis is
very low in this population (below 1%) and does not appear
to explain the use of antipsychotics. Involvement of a psy-
chiatrist suggests that these individuals may have a high
burden of illness and complexity. Our data support this, with

 comorbidity in males and females with ADHD compared
with those without. Furthermore, Table 1 shows much
higher rates of consultation of specialists, especially
psychiatrists, in individuals with ADHD. However, given
the known adverse consequences of antipsychotic exposure
in youth, such as metabolic consequences,40 and the limited
evidence for their use in ADHD treatment, the circum-
stances and outcomes related to antipsychotic use in ADHD
need further exploration.
This study had several unique strengths relative to exist-
ing literature on ADHD prevalence and treatment patterns.
Manual abstraction of psychiatric diagnoses allows the data
set to reflect a clinically representative sample of youth with
ADHD, and the manner in which they are treated in the
community, although the way in which they were diagnosed
with ADHD is not known. This study does not rely on self-
report or symptom-based scales. The large data set consists
of 10 000 charts, which were randomly identified from
across the province and allows for good representation of
Ontario’s socioeconomically and demographically diverse
region. With linkage to ICES administrative data, it has been
possible to link these carefully abstracted cases to physician
billing information and health service utilization information
and thereby provide detailed information about the state of
youth with ADHD in North America. Children are identified
as having ADHD if their primary health practitioner
believes them to have ADHD, regardless of how the family
physician came to this diagnosis (patient history, psychia-
tric consultation, psychoeducational assessment, screening
questionnaires, etc.), and this has enabled a greater under-
standing of children with ADHD in Canada and how they
are treated. A further strength of this study is that it includes
all patients treated by family physicians, rather than study-
ing prescriptions based on a particular prescriber, such as
Medicaid, and is not limited to patients who are supported
by social assistance.
However, there are several important methodological
limitations when considering these data. This data set
includes a broad sample of youth across rural and urban
settings in a large and ethnically diverse Ontario province,
but it does not include patients who exclusively see paedia-
tricians for their medical care as this was a family physician/
general practitioner EMR data set. This is likely not a sig-
nificant limitation in Ontario because the vast majority of
children and youth access family physicians for their pri-
mary health care,41 and the majority of mental health ser-
vices are provided by family physicians in Ontario.42 It also
does not include individuals who are not registered or ros-
tered with a family physician and may include relatively
fewer children who are in foster care or otherwise frequently
moving within the province. This study shows only prescrip-
tions, and the degree of medication adherence and whether
or not the prescriptions were filled are not known. These are
prescriptions provided or recorded by the family physician,
and prescriptions from other providers are variably popu-
lated in the family physician EMR. The timing of
prescriptions (sequential, overlapping) and duration of use
are not known, limiting our ability to know if a patient was
taking a medication such as bupropion before or after a trial
of a stimulant or simultaneously. It should also be noted that
oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, and disrup-
tive mood dysregulation disorder (added to the Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition, in
2013) were not abstracted in this data set, and these diag-
noses are often indications for antipsychotic prescription
use. Further stratification of diagnosis, age, and sex within
ADHD and non-ADHD cohorts would be of interest, but it
was not possible as the numbers become too small to publish.
This study provides a unique perspective of youth with
ADHD who receive treatment from their family physicians.
By using family physician EMR data, this article is able to
study those individuals who have a diagnosis of ADHD
recorded in their primary care record. This study was gen-
erated from large, robust data, and manual review of charts
was used to confirm the diagnoses. A significant number of
youth with ADHD receive prescriptions for antipsychotics,
and these youth suffer from significant psychiatric comor-
bidities. This subset of patients requires further study to
determine the impact of antipsychotic medications on their
overall health and the interventions that are most helpful in
light of their complex psychiatric needs.
