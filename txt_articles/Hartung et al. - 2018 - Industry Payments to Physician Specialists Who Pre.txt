Abstract
IMPORTANCE Despite great expense and little evidence supporting use over corticosteroids,
prescriptions for repository corticotropin (H. P. Acthar Gel; Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals) have
increased markedly. Aggressive sales tactics and payments from the manufacturer may influence
prescribing behavior for this expensive medication.
OBJECTIVE To characterize industry payments to physician specialists who prescribe corticotropin
in the Medicare program.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This study was a cross-sectional analysis of Centers for
Medicare & Medicaid Services 2015 Part D prescribing data linked to 2015 Open Payments data.
Nephrologists, neurologists, and rheumatologists with more than 10 corticotropin prescriptions
(frequent prescribers) in 2015 were included.
EXPOSURES Frequency, category, and magnitude of corticotropin-related payments from
Mallinckrodt recorded in the Open Payments database.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Frequency, category, and magnitude of corticotropin-related
payments from Mallinckrodt, as well as corticotropin prescriptions and expenditures for Medicare
beneficiaries.
RESULTS Of the 235 included physicians, 65 were nephrologists; 59, neurologists; and 111,
rheumatologists. A majority of frequent corticotropin prescribers (207 [88%]) received
corticotropin-related payments from Mallinckrodt. The median (range) total payment for 2015 was
$189 ($11-$138 321), with the highest payments ranging from $56 549 to $138 321 across the
specialties. More than 20% of frequent prescribers received more than $10 000 and the top quartile
of recipients received a median (range) of $33 190 ($9934-$138 321) in total payments per prescriber.
Payments for compensation for services other than consulting contributed the most to the total
amount. Mallinckrodt payments were positively associated with greater Medicare spending on
corticotropin (β = 1.079; 95% CI, 1.044-1.115; P < .001), with every $10 000 in payments associated
with a 7.9% increase (approximately $53 000) in Medicare spending on corticotropin. There was no
association between corticotropin-related payments and spending on prescriptions for synthetic
corticosteroids.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this study, most nephrologists, neurologists, and
rheumatologists who frequently prescribe corticotropin received corticotropin-related payments
from Mallinckrodt. These findings suggest that financial conflicts of interest may be driving use of
corticotropin in the Medicare program.

 Introduction
It is well documented that the pharmaceutical industry spends a substantial amount of money to
influence the decisions of physicians who use their products.1,2 In 2016, pharmaceutical,
biotechnology, and device manufacturers paid 631 000 physicians more than $2 billion in food and
beverages, gifts, educational materials, and speaker and consulting services.3 Although physicians
often deny these payments affect their prescribing decisions, the evidence suggests the contrary.4-11
Studies consistently demonstrate pharmaceutical industry payments are associated with more
prescriptions, greater prescription costs, and higher branded drug prescribing.5,9,11,12 Furthermore,
several well-designed studies have demonstrated association specificity and a response gradient
(higher payments associated with greater prescribing), suggesting the association is causal.5,7,10
As high-priced therapies become the norm for many conditions, it is imperative that prescrib-
ing decisions are evidence based and free from undue commercial influence. Expensive therapies
with uncertain or insufficient evidence supporting their use should be particularly scrutinized. A
prime example of such a treatment is repository corticotropin (H. P. Acthar Gel; Mallinckrodt Phar-
maceuticals). Originally approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1952, cortico-
tropin has received considerable attention in recent years because of the dramatic increase in its
cost. Corticotropin is a porcine-derived biologic preparation with a proprietary manufacturing pro-
cess and for decades was available for less than $50 per vial. In 2007, Questcor Pharmaceuticals,
who acquired the license for corticotropin in 2001 for $100 000, raised the acquisition price for a
5-mL vial from $1650 to $23 269 (a 14-fold increase).13 Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals, which
acquired Questcor in 2014, has continued to raise the price to its current acquisition cost of
$38 892.14
There is a lack of evidence supporting the use of corticotropin for most indications.15
Corticotropin was approved prior to the 1962 Kefauver-Harris Amendment to the US Food, Drug, and
Cosmetics Act, which added the requirement of evidence of efficacy to the FDA approval process.16
As a consequence, corticotropin’
s original label lacked evidence derived from controlled clinical trials
that meet current standards for FDA approval for any indication. Over the ensuing years,
corticotropin’
s label has been revised several times, first as part of the FDA’
s Drug Efficacy Study
Implementation review in 1971, and then with the addition of indications for the treatment of
relapses of multiple sclerosis in 1979 and infantile spasms in 2010.17 The only randomized clinical
trials of corticotropin to treat relapses of multiple sclerosis show it to be more effective than placebo
(n = 197) but no better than methylprednisolone (n = 61).18,19 The use of corticotropin for infantile
spasms is supported by 5 controlled clinical trials of between 24 and 50 (mean, 34) participants.20-24
Corticotropin is also indicated and promoted on its website for systemic lupus erythematosus,
proteinuria in nephrotic syndrome, dermatomyositis and polymyositis, rheumatoid arthritis,
symptoms of sarcoidosis, and inflammatory conditions of the eye, such as uveitis. With the exception
of a small placebo-controlled trial of 38 individuals with systemic lupus erythematosus
demonstrating equivocal efficacy compared with placebo,25 the clinical evidence supporting the
efficacy of corticotropin for these indications generally consists of small (n < 25) uncontrolled trials
and case reports.26
Because of its very high price, corticotropin is a major expenditure for public insurance
programs in the United States. From 2011 to 2015, spending on corticotropin in the US Medicare
program increased 10-fold, totaling more than $1 billion during this period.27 In 2015 alone, Medicare
spent more than $500 million on corticotropin, making it one of the most expensive drugs paid for
by the program.28 The continued growth in corticotropin use is peculiar given its very high cost,
widespread negative media coverage, and notable lack of evidence supporting its use over lower-
cost synthetic corticosteroids.29,30 Our experience suggests aggressive marketing of the drug partly
accounts for increasing use. While media reports also indicate that industry payments to
corticotropin prescribers may have a role, the prevalence, magnitude, and effect of corticotropin-
related payments have not been systematically described.30 The goal of this research was to

 characterize payments to physicians who frequently prescribe corticotropin to Medicare
beneficiaries and determine whether payment amounts are positively correlated with prescribing
intensity.
Methods
Study Sample and Data Sources
Using several publicly accessible databases provided by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid
Services (CMS), we conducted a cross-sectional study to describe pharmaceutical industry payments
to nephrologists, neurologists, and rheumatologists who frequently prescribe corticotropin in the
Medicare Part D program. To identify Medicare prescribers of corticotropin, we used Medicare Part
D Public Use Files (PUFs) from 2015.31 Medicare Part D PUFs contain prescription information
aggregated at different levels for drugs paid for by Medicare Part D stand-alone plans and Medicare
Advantage plans and include data for 71% of all 56 million Medicare beneficiaries.28 The Detailed
Prescriber PUF summarizes total prescriptions and costs for every drug with more than 10
prescriptions by a prescriber. We used the Detailed Prescriber PUF to identify and determine the
specialty of physicians who prescribed corticotropin in 2015. Drugs with 10 or fewer prescriptions per
prescriber are suppressed by CMS to protect patient confidentiality. We focused on rheumatology,
neurology, and nephrology specialists, who are the largest prescribers of corticotropin.27 Because
this study used publicly available data, the Oregon Health & Science University institutional review
board deemed it exempt from review. Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in
Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guidelines were followed.
To summarize characteristics of these frequent corticotropin prescribers, we used the Medicare
Part D Prescriber PUF and data from CMS Physician Compare. The Part D Prescriber PUF contains
drug utilization data (eg, total prescriptions, beneficiaries, and expenditures for Medicare) for all
participating Part D prescribers. We used the CMS Physician Compare data set to characterize other
practice-related data, such as year of graduation from medical school and practice size. The CMS
Physician Compare data set contains general demographic, training, and practice site information for
all health care professionals who provide Medicare services. For comparison, we also summarized
Part D prescribing and practice characteristics for all other neurologists, rheumatologists, and
nephrologists who provide Medicare services.
To obtain information on industry payments, we used 2015 calendar year files from the Open
Payments website. The Open Payments program began collecting information about payments from
drug and device companies to physicians and teaching hospitals in 2013.32 Reported payments
include consulting fees, honoraria, gifts, entertainment, food and beverage, travel, and research
payments and ownership interests.33 All payments with a cash value of at least $10, or $100 in
aggregate in 1 calendar year, must be reported. The payment data also report the specific product
(eg, drugs, devices, biologics) to which the payment was related.
For corticotropin prescribers identified in the Medicare Part D PUF, we manually reviewed his or
her Open Payments physician demographic characteristics record to verify concordance. While PUFs
are indexed by each prescriber’
s National Prescriber Identifier, Open Payments only includes name
and location as identifiers. If prescriber specialty differed between the Medicare Part D PUF and
Open Payments data, we used CMS Physician Compare data to verify the physician’
s specialty. If a
prescriber was not found within Open Payments, we verified their specialty in Physician Compare
and considered them to not have received any industry payments. Only 1 prescriber’
s specialty
designation was misclassified in the Medicare PUF.
After we verified the linkage between each corticotropin prescriber and his or her Open
Payments record, we extracted information from the Open Payments data on total payment
amounts, number of transactions, and types of payments from Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals in 2015.
We only included Mallinckrodt payments if the payment indicated it was for corticotropin. Our
analysis included general payments (eg, honoraria or consulting), research payments, and ownership

 payments. We also extracted and summarized payments from Mallinckrodt unrelated to
corticotropin and all other companies.
Statistical Analysis
We analyzed the prevalence, frequency, category, and monetary amount of corticotropin-related
payments by Mallinckrodt. Physician and payment characteristics were summarized with descriptive
statistics as appropriate depending on their nature and distribution.
We evaluated the association between payment amounts and Medicare expenditures on
corticotropin in 2 ways. First, we grouped prescribers into categories by the total dollar amounts of
corticotropin-related payments received from Mallinckrodt and examined the trend in total
corticotropin prescriptions and expenditures using the Kendall rank correlation coefficient statistic
(Kendall τ). We also conducted multivariable linear regression analyses to evaluate whether payment
amounts were positively correlated with corticotropin Medicare expenditures. Our dependent
variable was the dollar amount that Medicare spent on corticotropin. The primary independent
variable was the total Mallinckrodt corticotropin-related payment to these specialists. Similar to
DeJong et al,7 we controlled for the following covariates: physician specialty, sex, group practice size,
years since graduation from medical school, and geographic region. To adjust for differences in other
prescribing behaviors, we included covariates measuring the number of noncorticotropin
prescriptions per beneficiary and the cost of noncorticotropin prescriptions per claim. We also
adjusted for total payments unrelated to corticotropin from industry (eg, payments from other
companies) to control for differences in engagement with other companies. For our primary analysis,
we transformed the dependent variable with natural logarithmic transformation because Medicare
spending data were right skewed. Relative to an untransformed model, using a logarithmic-
transformed dependent variable resulted in improved model fit and diagnostic performance.
Finally, to assess the specificity of the association between corticotropin-related payments and
corticotropin spending, we conducted a falsification test to evaluate the association between
corticotropin-related payments and synthetic corticosteroid spending. Using the same modeling
approach, we tested the association between corticotropin-related payments and spending for
prednisone, methylprednisolone, prednisolone, dexamethasone, and cortisone. A positive
relationship between corticotropin-related payments and corticosteroid spending would suggest
any observed association between corticotropin-related payments and corticotropin spending may
be confounded by other factors, such as patient severity of illness. For prescribers with no recorded
corticosteroid spending, we imputed 0.001 before performing log transformation.
Analyses were conducted using SAS statistical software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute), and R
statistical software, version 3.3.3 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing). All tests were 2-sided and
P values less than .05 were considered statistically significant.
Results
In 2015, Medicare spent $504 million for 11 209 corticotropin prescriptions written by 1743
prescribers. More than half of this expenditure ($266 197 661) was attributable to 300 prescribers
(17.2%) with more than 10 corticotropin prescriptions. Most of these prescribers (n = 235) were
identified, and verified, as rheumatologists (n = 111), neurologists (n = 59), or nephrologists (n = 65).
Of the remaining 65 frequent prescribers, 24 were listed as internists, 19 were pulmonologists, 8 had
other specialty designations (1 each for allergy and immunology, dermatology, diagnostic radiology,
emergency medicine, family practice, neurosurgery, ophthalmology, and pain management), and 14
were other midlevel practitioners (9 nurse practitioners and 5 physician assistants).
The characteristics of the 235 frequent corticotropin prescribers and all other Medicare
prescribers in their specialty groups (n = 26 046) are summarized in Table 1. In 2015, Medicare spent
a total of $203 255 335 for corticotropin prescribed by these 235 physicians (median [interquartile
range], $678 706 [$465 974-$984 020] per prescriber). Expenditures for corticotropin among

 frequent prescribers accounted for 37% of their total Part D expenditures, but ranged from 21% for
neurologists to 54% for nephrologists. Frequent corticotropin prescribers were more likely to
practice in smaller practices, write more prescriptions, and prescribe more expensive drugs than
their specialty peers. Frequent corticotropin prescribers also prescribed more synthetic
corticosteroids than their peers. Of these 235 physician prescribers of corticotropin, 25 (11%)
practiced within an academic medical center.
In 2015, Mallinckrodt paid $11 442 866 ($7 325 957 in general payments and $4 116 908 in
research payments) to 10 491 physicians for corticotropin (10 452 for general payments and 97 for
research payments). Among frequent corticotropin prescribers in our study, Mallinckrodt made a
total of 5315 corticotropin-related payments to 207 prescribers (88% of frequent corticotropin
specialist prescribers), totaling $2 213 727 ($1 986 926 in general payments and $226 801 in research
payments). Table 2 summarizes the distribution and types of corticotropin-related payments made
by Mallinckrodt to these frequent prescribers. Most nephrologists and nearly all neurologists and
rheumatologists received at least 1 corticotropin-related payment from Mallinckrodt. Overall, while
the median (range) total payment amounts during the year were modest at $189 ($11-$138 321),
maximum total payment amounts were as high as $56 549 for nephrology, $120 387 for neurology,
and $138 321 for rheumatology. The median (range) total payment for the top quartile of the 207
prescribers who received at least 1 payment was $33 190 ($9934-$138 321) overall, but ranged from
$5249 for nephrologists to $41 405 for neurologists. Neurologists were the most likely to receive a
payment (93.2% vs 78.5% for nephrologists and 91.0% for rheumatologists), had the greatest
number of transactions (20 vs 5 for nephrologists and 13 for rheumatologists), and received the
highest median total dollar amount over the year ($476 vs $118 for nephrologists and $207 for
rheumatologists). Differences in total payments were driven by a higher likelihood of consulting,

 travel, and compensation for services other than consulting. Payments to neurologists for services
other than consulting contributed the most to this difference (median [range] total payment amount,
$15 865 [$1990-$91 400]). Research-related payments totaled $226 801 for 12 prescribers (5.1%).
They were particularly high for 4 rheumatologists, who received a total of $214 281 (median [range],
$53 208 [$32 865-$75 000]) during the year. No prescribers received ownership-related payments.
As shown in eTable 1 in the Supplement, payments to these prescribers unrelated to corticotropin
were also common and substantial.
In Table 3 and the Figure, we summarize corticotropin use by corticotropin-related payment
amount categories. Among the 50 prescribers (21.3%) who received more than $10 000 in payments
during the year, corticotropin expenditures per prescriber (mean [SD], $1 304 884 [$1 022 937])
were more than double that of the 45 prescribers (19.2%) who received $25 dollars or less (mean
[SD], $594 976 [$256 357]). There were 4 prescribers who received more than $100 000 in
payments from Mallinckrodt. There were significant associations between payment amount
category and corticotropin expenditures (Kendall τ = 0.29; P < .001) and payment amount category
and number of prescriptions (Kendall τ = 0.252; P < .001) among these frequent prescribers.
Our multivariable regression analysis is summarized in Table 4 and shows that Medicare
spending on corticotropin increased by 7.9% (approximately $53 000) for every $10 000 increase
in payments to prescribers (β = 1.079; 95% CI, 1.044-1.115; P < .001). The only other significant
predictors of Medicare spending on corticotropin were prescriber specialty and sex. In contrast,
there was no association between corticotropin-related payments and Medicare spending on
corticosteroids (eTable 2 in the Supplement).
Discussion
In our study, 207 of 235 frequent corticotropin prescribers (88%) received a corticotropin-related
payment from Mallinckrodt. In 2015, Mallinckrodt made a total of $7 325 957 in general

 non–research-related corticotropin payments to 10 452 physicians. Of this amount, $1 986 926
(27%) was paid to the 207 frequent corticotropin prescribers (2% of all physicians receiving
Mallinckrodt payments for corticotropin) in our study. In contrast, a recent population-based study
found that among all specialists, only 35% receive payments from industry.34 Although the median
total payment for the year was only $189, more than 20% of prescribers received more than
$10 000, the top quartile of prescribers received more than $30 000, and several physicians
received more than $100 000. The larger dollar amounts given to neurologists were attributable to
a higher prevalence of consulting payments or compensation for services other than consulting
among these specialists. In general, the category of compensation for services other than consulting
had the largest dollar amount per transaction. This category is defined by CMS as “payments made
to physicians for speaking, training, and education engagements that are not for continuing
education.”3 Although precise definitions of reporting categories are not provided, this category
likely includes serving on industry speakers’bureaus and other activities that involve giving talks to
physician groups. Finally, we found a significant association between the magnitude of payments and
total corticotropin expenditures. Our analysis suggests that every $10 000 spent by Mallinckrodt for
payments to physicians is associated with a 7.9% increase in Medicare spending on corticotropin.
Based on a median Medicare expenditure per prescriber of $678 706, we would expect a $10 000
increase in payments to yield approximately $53 000 in additional Medicare spending.
Our findings are consistent with other research that examines both the prevalence and extent
of influence of pharmaceutical industry payments on physicians. Three large cross-sectional studies
that used a similar approach for other medications found that industry payments were positively
correlated with increased drug-specific prescribing.7-9 These studies provide evidence that even
small payments, such as meals, are consistently associated with increased prescribing behavior.

 Additionally, studies focusing on payments by specific manufacturers in several medical specialties
report results similar to our own. Two studies evaluating the use of anti–vascular endothelial growth
factor injections for eye diseases found payments by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Genentech
were associated with a higher likelihood of using aflibercept or ranibizumab, respectively, vs lower
cost, off-label bevacizumab.10,35 Studies of the impact of industry payments on urologists or
oncologists treating prostate cancer reveal similar patterns.6,36,37
Our findings contrast with the prior literature arising from Open Payments data in several ways.
First, about 90% of physicians who frequently prescribed corticotropin received at least 1 payment
from Mallinckrodt. Among the ophthalmologists,10 urologists,37 and oncologists36 examined in
recent studies of other expensive medications, only 34% to 57% of identified drug prescribers
received a manufacturer-related payment. Additionally, payments by Mallinckrodt in the present
study appear to be larger than the amounts reported in other studies. In this report, almost a third of
frequent prescribers received more than $1000 from Mallinckrodt. In contrast, only 3.8% of
prescribers of anti–vascular endothelial growth factor received more than $1000 from the associated
manufacturer.10 While the reasons for this discrepancy are unclear, it may be attributable to the
extent to which Mallinckrodt’
s product portfolio depends on corticotropin, which accounted for
more than a third of total sales in 2016.38 Alternatively, a higher-stakes sales approach may be
required to compensate for the lack of compelling evidence justifying corticotropin use over
standard synthetic steroids. The most common prescribers of corticotropin are rheumatologists,
neurologists, and nephrologists,27 suggesting the use of corticotropin in individuals with rheumatic
disorders, multiple sclerosis, and nephrotic syndrome. Among these conditions, controlled clinical
trial data only support corticotropin use to treat exacerbations of multiple sclerosis,18,19 although it is
no more effective than methylprednisolone. The use of corticotropin for rheumatoid arthritis,39
dermatomyositis and polymyositis,40-42 systemic lupus erythematosus,25,43 and nephrotic
syndrome44-48 is largely supported by small uncontrolled studies or case series.
Limitations
Our study has several limitations. First, CMS suppresses prescription information for drugs that have
10 or fewer prescriptions in the Medicare PUF files. Although frequent corticotropin prescribers
account for more than half of all corticotropin expenditures by Medicare, it is unclear to what extent
our observations generalize to the other 1443 corticotropin prescribers who cannot be identified in
the data set. Another issue relates to the accuracy of the Open Payments and Medicare PUF data
sets. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services allows and recommends that physicians review
payment data and dispute any errors in their records. However, residual inaccuracies may persist.
Additionally, Medicare expenditure data do not include any proprietary discounts or rebates, and are
therefore likely an overestimate of the net cost to Medicare. Rebates for corticotropin for Medicare
are less than federal Medicaid mandatory rebates and are likely around 10%.32 Finally, although these
data may indicate a causal association between Mallinckrodt payments and corticotropin
prescriptions, our study was cross-sectional and the temporal sequence between payments and
prescriptions cannot be definitely established. It is conceivable that the company preferentially
sought out and supported prominent prescribers of corticotropin.
Conclusions
Corticotropin is an expensive drug of questionable clinical value that is a large and growing expense
for the Medicare program, and perhaps other payers. Our results show that most frequent
prescribers of corticotropin in the Medicare program received financial payments from Mallinckrodt,
the drug’
s maker. Furthermore, we observed a positive association between the amount of money
paid to these prescribers, their prescribing intensity, and corticotropin expenditures in the Medicare
program with a return on investment for Mallinckrodt of about 5:1. Transparency remains a necessary
part of conflict of interest management, and we advocate that physicians who receive significant

 payments from Mallinckrodt disclose this to patients before prescribing corticotropin for them or
consider not receiving any payments from Mallinckrodt. However, disclosure alone may not be
sufficient. While academic medical institutions49 have implemented conflict of interest policies
intended to limit many of the activities observed in this study, those in private practice, like most
prescribers in this study, are subject to little oversight. Given the financial consequences for many
expensive therapies (both new and old), other stakeholders, including payers, may need to explore
other strategies to manage these conflicts.
