Abstract
We performed a population-based case–control study of United States Medicare
beneficiaries age 60–90 in 2009 with prescription data (48,295 incident Parkin-
son disease cases and 52,324 controls) to examine the risk of Parkinson disease
in relation to use of immunosuppressants. Inosine monophosphate dehydroge-
nase inhibitors (relative risk = 0.64; 95% confidence interval 0.51–0.79) and
corticosteroids (relative risk = 0.80; 95% confidence interval 0.77–0.83) were
both associated with a lower risk of Parkinson disease. Inverse associations for
both remained after applying a 12-month exposure lag. Overall, this study pro-
vides evidence that use of corticosteroids and inosine monophosphate dehydro-
genase inhibitors might lower the risk of Parkinson disease.
Introduction
Numerous studies have attempted to identify neuropro-
tective medications to slow the progression of Parkinson
disease (PD), but all have failed to meet primary end-
points.1–5 As a result, there are no approved medications
that alter PD progression. One potential reason for the
failure of these clinical trials is that all attempts to modify
disease course with putative neuroprotective medications
were in patients with established PD. In an attempt to
identify PD patients during their prodromal phase, we
recently developed a PD predictive model that uses
administrative data from the Medicare program.6 In this
model,
several
diagnoses
commonly
treated
with
immunosuppressants were inversely associated with PD.
In this study, we performed a targeted pharmacoepidemi-
ology analysis to investigate the risk of PD in relation to
immunosuppressant use.

 Methods
Study design
We conducted a population-based case–control study
using Medicare claims data from the United States
(U.S.), following approval from the Centers for Medicare
and
Medicaid
(CMS),
and
the
Institutional
Review
Board at Washington University in St. Louis. Medicare
is the U.S. national health insurance for those 65 and
older, as well as the disabled, and provides health care
for 98% of the U.S. population age 65 and older.
Approximately, 25% of those age 65–90 who receive
Medicare use a Medicare Advantage plan, which does
not report claims data to the CMS. As a result, data
from those patients cannot be included in this study.
Approximately, 50% of those with traditional fee-for-ser-
vice Medicare use Medicare Part D to pay for prescrip-
tion
medication
costs.
All
participants
were
U.S.
residents who were age 66–90 years old and relied solely
on Medicare for health insurance (Parts A/B) in 2009.6
For the present analysis, we further focused on benefi-
ciaries with Medicare Part D (pharmacy) coverage with
at least one prescription drug claim (medication fill) in
2008–2009.
Among beneficiaries who met these criteria, we deter-
mined PD status from comprehensive (inpatient, skilled
nursing
facility,
outpatient,
physician/carrier,
durable
medical equipment, and home health care) Part A and B
Medicare
claims
data
for
2004–2009.
PD
cases
(n = 48,295) had at least one International Classification
of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-
9) diagnosis code for PD (332 or 332.0) in 2009 and no
prior PD codes. Using this case definition, we have been
able to replicate all of the well-established PD-disease/
demographic associations.6 Controls (n = 52,324) were
from a random sample of beneficiaries who met the same
criteria, but without PD codes. These beneficiaries repre-
sented 54% of cases and 44% of controls from the origi-
nal
case–control
study,6
which
included
all
newly
diagnosed PD cases in 2009 and a 0.5% random sample
of all noncases who met study criteria. We avoided
matching controls to cases so that we could obtain unbi-
ased risk estimates for demographic factors known to be
associated with PD and, hence, include them in a predic-
tive model of PD, the primary purpose of the sample.6
Regression models that adjust for potential matching vari-
ables are a suitable alternative to matching,7 especially
when there is sufficient overlap between cases and con-
trols on matching factors, as in our study. This approach
also avoids potential loss in statistical power due to
matching.8
Assessment of covariates and
immunosuppressant use
We identified ever/never use of seven immunosuppressant
drug classes and 26 specific medications in those classes
in 2008–2009, prior to PD diagnosis/reference, using Part
D data. The categories included calcineurin inhibitors (cy-
closporine, tacrolimus); Inosine monophosphate dehydro-
genase (IMDH) inhibitors
(azathioprine,
leflunomide,
mycophenolate);
dihydrofolate
reductase
inhibitors
(methotrexate);
biologics
(abatacept,
adalimumab,
anakinra, certolizumab, etanercept); corticosteroids (pred-
nisone,
prednisolone,
methylprednisolone,
dexametha-
sone,
cortisone,
hydrocortisone);
and
miscellaneous
(hydroxychloroquine,
sulfasalazine,
mesalamine,
inter-
feron beta-1a, thalidomide, lenalidomide, glatiramer acet-
ate,
flingolimod,
and
dimethyl
fumarate).
Other
immunosuppressants were used too infrequently to be
included in these analyses. Only oral, rectal, or parenteral
forms of medications were considered for these analyses.
We used ICD-9 and Current Procedural Terminology
(CPT) codes from 2004 to 2009, up to the time of PD
diagnosis/reference, to assess ever/never tobacco smoking.
Because there were no specific incentives for physicians to
code smoking behaviors during the time window of this
study, we estimated and validated the probability of hav-
ing ever smoked based on >600 codes, sex, race/ethnicity,
and birth year.6 The relationship between this smoking
variable and PD risk reasonably approximated the known
inverse association demonstrated in numerous previous
studies.6,9 We also calculated the total number of unique
diagnosis codes prior to PD diagnosis/reference as a mea-
sure of overall use of medical care.
Statistical analysis
We used Stata MP version 14.2 (College Station, Texas)
to construct logistic regression models with PD as the
outcome and specific immunosuppressants as indepen-
dent variables. We used the odds ratios (ORs) and 95%
confidence intervals (CIs) from these models to estimate
relative risk (RR), since PD is uncommon. We adjusted
for age, sex, race/ethnicity, smoking, and count of unique
diagnosis codes a priori.6 We also examined the effect of
lagging medication exposure by 12 months. The purpose
of lagging the medication exposure was to minimize any
effect on the association with PD due to reverse causa-
tion, whereby, symptoms of prodromal PD result in pref-
erential use or avoidance of a medication. We applied
this lag by ignoring immunosuppressant use that occurred
in the 12 months prior to the PD diagnosis date or con-
trol reference date, and excluding cases and controls who

 had no fills of any medication prior to that 12-month
period. To investigate for potential confounding by indi-
cation, we tested the effect of including every ICD-9/CPT
code, individually, in the association models for corticos-
teroids and IMDH inhibitors. We retained in the final
model any code that altered the respective PD-immuno-
suppresant RR by more than 10% and was a code that
was a medically appropriate indication for immunosup-
pressants.

Results
Characteristics of cases and controls
Most
cases
and
controls
were
non-Hispanic
white
(Table 1), consistent with demographic characteristics of
the general adult and PD population in the U.S. We
observed the expected greater risk of PD with increasing
age (case mean 78.6 years, control mean 76.4 years), male
sex, and lower risk with tobacco use (all P < 0.001).
Immunosuppressant class and PD risk
Of the six categories of immunosuppressants, two were
clearly associated with a lower risk of PD: Corticosteroids
(RR = 0.80; 95% CI 0.77–0.83) and IMDH inhibitors
(RR = 0.64; 95% CI 0.51–0.79). (Tables 2 and 3) These
findings were consistent when imposing a 12-month lag
on medication “exposure” (Tables 2 and 3) or adjusting
for indications associated with smoking (e.g., chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma (results not
shown)). The other classes of immunosuppressants were
not as clearly inversely associated with PD risk, although
those taking methotrexate had a borderline lower risk of
PD (RR = 0.84; 95% CI 0.74–0.95). When we investigated
for confounding by indication, no ICD-9/CPT codes
altered the respective PD-immunosuppresant RR by more
than 10% and were a medically appropriate indication for
immunosuppressant use.
Specific IMDH inhibitors and corticosteroids
and PD risk
When we considered medications within the IMDH inhi-
bitor category, each was consistently associated with a
lower risk of PD. Mycophenolate was associated with the
lowest
risk
of
PD
(RR = 0.55;
95%
CI
0.31–0.98),

 0.88); methylprednisolone (RR = 0.80; 95% CI 0.76–
0.84). For those taking both a corticosteroid and an
IMDH inhibitor, risk of PD was 0.53 (95% CI 0.40–0.70)
in the unlagged model and 0.60 (95% CI 0.42–0.84) in
the 12-month lagged model.
Discussion
In this large population-based study, use of immunosup-
pressants, namely corticosteroids and IMDH inhibitors,
was associated with a lower risk of PD, even after impos-
ing an “exposure” lag. This relationship was consistent
across most of drugs in these two classes. IMDH inhibi-
tors appeared to be the most strongly protective, although
RRs for medications within this class were imprecise
because these medications were used infrequently. The
potentially
protective
effect
from
corticosteroids
was
somewhat weaker, and we cannot completely rule out the
possibility that this inverse association is due to con-
founding by smoking, since corticosteroids are used fre-
quently for pulmonary symptoms related to smoking.
Although both IMDH inhibitors and corticosteroids are
associated with serious potential morbidity with long-
term use, physicians often employ corticosteroid-sparing
strategies, in patients requiring chronic immunosuppres-
sion, to avoid morbidities such as metabolic dysfunction,
osteoporosis, and cardiovascular disease.10 As such, the
IMDH inhibitors may be the preferable category of
immunosuppressants to consider pursuing for potential
PD neuroprotection.
While corticosteroids affect both acute and chronic
inflammation by multiple mechanisms, the IMDH inhibi-
tor mechanism is much more specific. IMDH inhibitors
block DNA synthesis by inhibition of inosine monophos-
phate dehydrogenase, the rate-limiting step in synthesis of
guanosine nucleotides, which preferentially impacts T-
cells.11 This inhibition synthesis of cellular adhesion
receptors involved in cell-to-cell contacts. The immuno-
suppressant effects of these medications are likely due to
suppression of T-cell response to allogeneic cells and anti-
gens.12 Although it is not clear that these medications
cross an intact blood–brain barrier,12,13 the potential neu-
roprotective mechanism could be entirely due to periph-
eral
suppression
of
T-cell
activity.
For
example,
suppression of T-cell activity might suppress propagation
of peripheral a-synuclein aggregation in the gastrointesti-
nal tract, which may be an important peripheral site that
initiates the PD neurodegenerative cascade.14,15 Alterna-
tively, there is growing evidence that neuroinflammation
may play a critical role in the pathogenesis of neurode-
generative diseases, including PD, and these drugs could
impact the neuroinflammatory component of PD neu-
rodegeneration through peripheral T-cell immunomodu-
lation.16–18 Although we can only speculate as to the
potential mechanism of these immunomodulatory drugs
on PD, this pharmacoepidemiology study provides addi-
tional evidence of a potential role of the immune system
in disease risk and potential therapeutic targets to modify
risk of PD and possibly even PD progression.
While our study has considerable strengths, including
size and comparability of cases and controls, there are a
few limitations. Since Medicare provides insurance cover-
age for the elderly U.S. population, we could not estimate
the risk of PD in relation to these immunosuppressants
in younger patients. We were also limited to a relatively
narrow window of exposure and have to assume that
patients took these medications for extended periods dur-
ing their lives, limiting our ability to make causal infer-
ence and to conduct analyses that consider cumulative
dose. While this assumption of long-term use may be true
for IMDH inhibitors, it is probably less true for corticos-
teroids, which are used more episodically for numerous
conditions. As with any administrative data study, we also
could
not
confirm
patient
adherence,

4Adjusted for age (two linear splines with a knot at 85 years), sex,
race/ethnicity (7 categories), probability of ever/never smoking (contin-
uous), and total count of unique diagnosis codes (continuous for the
respective period, that is, up to PD diagnosis/control reference date or
up to 12 months prior to that date).
5Includes methotrexate.
6Includes abatacept, anakinra, certolizumab, but respective RRs could
not be estimated due to small numbers.
7Includes interferon beta-1a, glatiramer acetate, flingolimod, dimethyl
fumarate but respective RRs could not be estimated due to small
numbers.

Immunosuppressants and Parkinson Disease
B. A. Racette et al.
 prescriptions filled are a reasonable proxy for use, and it
is unlikely that lack of patient adherence could have cre-
ated the particularly strong inverse association for IMDH
inhibitors. Nonetheless, we acknowledge that the number
of patients taking IMDH inhibitors and some of the other
individual medications was quite small relative to the
overall size of the dataset, making some of the estimated
ORs imprecise. Future studies with longer windows of
exposure will be necessary to investigate dose-response
relations between these medications and PD risk.
Finally, there are likely multiple mechanisms to the
corticosteroid
immunosuppressant
effects,10
making
potential
neuroprotective
mechanisms
less
targeted.
Therefore, the IMDH inhibitors may represent the most
promising potential drug class for PD neuroprotection.
