Abstract Salicylate and acetylsalicylic acid are potent and widely used anti-inflammatory drugs.
They are thought to exert their therapeutic effects through multiple mechanisms, including the
inhibition of cyclo-oxygenases, modulation of NF-kB activity, and direct activation of AMPK.
However, the full spectrum of their activities is incompletely understood. Here we show that
salicylate specifically inhibits CBP and p300 lysine acetyltransferase activity in vitro by direct
competition with acetyl-Coenzyme A at the catalytic site. We used a chemical structure-similarity
search to identify another anti-inflammatory drug, diflunisal, that inhibits p300 more potently than
salicylate. At concentrations attainable in human plasma after oral administration, both salicylate
and diflunisal blocked the acetylation of lysine residues on histone and non-histone proteins in cells.
Finally, we found that diflunisal suppressed the growth of p300-dependent leukemia cell lines
expressing AML1-ETO fusion protein in vitro and in vivo. These results highlight a novel epigenetic
regulatory mechanism of action for salicylate and derivative drugs.

Introduction
The anti-inflammatory activity of salicylate was first described by the Greek physician Hippocrates.
One of its widely used derivatives, acetylsalicylic acid (Aspirin), inhibits prostaglandin biosynthesis by
irreversibly inactivating cyclooxygenases via non-enzymatic acetylation of a single serine residue
(Warner et al., 1999). Interestingly, salicylic acid does not possess this acetylating activity (since it is
lacking the acetyl group) and does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in vitro.
However, salicylic acid blocks cyclooxygenase expression at the transcriptional level thereby
explaining its anti-inflammatory properties (Xu et al., 1999). In addition, both salicylic acid and aspi-
rin inhibit nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) activity (Kopp and Ghosh, 1994) by inhibiting IkB kinase b
(IKKb) (Yin et al., 1998). Other possible mechanisms of action have been proposed that include JNK
pathway inhibition (Schwenger et al., 1997) and direct allosteric activation of AMP kinase (AMPK)

 (Hawley et al., 2012). However, the pleiotropic effects of salicylate treatment on different cell types
remain incompletely understood.
Salsalate, a salicylate precursor, is an effective therapy for type 2 diabetes (Goldfine et al.,
2010), a metabolic disorder associated with insulin resistance and a strong pro-inflammatory compo-
nent dependent on NF-kB (Donath and Shoelson, 2011). The efficacy of salicylates on insulin resis-
tance is thought to reflect its anti-inflammatory activity and to be mediated by IKKb inhibition
(Yin et al., 1998).
Interestingly, examination of the chemical structure of anacardic acid, a previously reported p300
inhibitor,
revealed
that
it
contained
a
salicylic
acid
moiety
linked
to
a
long
alkyl
chain
(Balasubramanyam et al., 2003; Sung et al., 2008). Previously, we showed that full activation of
NF-kB activity requires the reversible acetylation of NF-kB by CBP/p300 histone acetyltransferases
(HATs) (Chen et al., 2001). Here, we have tested the possibility that salicylic acid might exert its
transcriptional inhibitory activity by directly affecting NF-kB acetylation via inhibition of CBP/p300
acetyltransferase activity.
Results
Salicylate inhibits CBP/p300 acetyltransferase activity by directly
competing with acetyl-CoA in vitro
To
determine
whether
salicylate
inhibits
p300
and
other
acetyltransferases,
we
used
in
vitro acetylation assays with purified histones and a recombinant p300 catalytic domain. Salicylate
effectively inhibited p300 dependent acetyltransferase activity (IC50 = 10.2 mM) and CBP-mediated
acetyltransferase activity (IC50 = 5.7 mM) in vitro, but did not detectably inhibit PCAF or GCN5 ace-
tyltransferases (Figure 1A) in vitro.
To confirm that salicylate binds to p300, we used thermal stability assays. A p300 HAT domain
construct (residues 1279–1666) bearing an inactivating Tyr1467Phe mutation to facilitate purification
of homogeneously hypoacetylated p300 was expressed and purified with an N-terminal 6-His tag
from E. coli cells. The protein was further purified by chromatography and incubated with increasing
concentrations of sodium salicylate for 30 min and with SYPRO orange dye (Invitrogen). Thermal
melt curves were obtained by heating the protein from 20–95˚C and monitoring fluorescence at 590
nm. This experiment revealed that the thermal unfolding temperature of p300/acetyl-CoA was
eLife digest People have been using a chemical called salicylate, which was once extracted
from willow tree bark, as medicine for pain, fever and inflammation since ancient Greece. Aspirin is
derived from salicylate but is a more potent drug. Aspirin exerts its anti-inflammatory effect by
shutting down the activity of proteins that would otherwise boost inflammation. Aspirin achieves this
by releasing a chemical marker, called an acetyl group, to be added to these proteins via a process
known as protein acetylation. However, salicylate cannot trigger protein acetylation and so it was
not clear how it reduces inflammation.
An anti-diabetes drug that is converted into salicylate in the body reduces inflammation by
inhibiting a protein called NF-kB. In 2001, a group of researchers reported that NF-kB becomes
active when an enzyme called p300 adds an acetyl group to it. This raised the question: does
salicylate reduce inflammation by blocking, instead of triggering, protein acetylation.
Now, Shirakawa et al. – who include a researcher involved in the 2001 study – show that salicylate
does indeed block the activity of the p300 enzyme. Shirakawa et al. then searched a database
looking for drugs that have salicylate as part of their molecular structure. The search led to a drug
called diflunisal, which was even more effective at blocking p300 in laboratory tests.
Some cancers, including a blood cancer, rely on p300 to grow; diflunisal was shown to stop this
kind of cancer cell from growing, both in the laboratory and in mice. Together, the experiments
suggest that salicylate and drugs that share some of its structure might represent useful treatments
for certain cancers, as well as other diseases that involve the p300 enzyme.

 48.6˚C, while treatment with 10 and 25 mM salicylate reduced the unfolding temperature to 46.1˚C
and 40.8˚C, respectively (Figure 1B). Kinetic analysis of p300 acetyltransferase activity with various
concentrations of acetyl-CoA (Figure 1C) and histone (Figure 1D) substrates revealed that salicylate
exhibits direct competitive p300 inhibition against acetyl-CoA and noncompetitive inhibition against
histones. Taking this data together, we surmised that salicylate inhibits p300 acetyltransferase activ-
ity by directly competing with acetyl-CoA binding near its binding site on CBP and p300.

 Salicylate inhibits specific lysine acetylation of histone and non-histone
proteins independently of AMPK activation
To determine whether salicylate induces histone deacetylation directly in cells, we treated HEK293T
cells with various concentrations of salicylate. Western blot analysis with antibodies against various
specific acetyl-lysine modifications of histone H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 showed that addition of salicy-
late correlated with the deacetylation of H2AK5/K9, H2BK12/K15, and H3K56 in a dose-dependent man-
ner (Figure 2A and Figure 2—figure supplement 1). Other histone residues, including H3K9, K14,
K27, K36 and H4K5, K8, K12, K16, have also been reported to be acetylated by CBP/p300 (Schiltz et al.,
1999; Kouzarides, 2007), but their acetylation state did not change in response to salicylate, possi-
bly as a consequence of redundant activity of other acetyltransferases in the cellular environment
(Kouzarides, 2007) or opposing effects caused by inhibition of its previously characterized targets.
The IC50 for salicylate-mediated inhibition of H2B acetylation (4.8 mM) was close to the IC50 of CBP
measured in vitro and to the plasma concentrations of salicylate (1–3 mM) in humans after oral
administration (Goldfine et al., 2010; 2013).
To further test the hypothesis that p300 is a relevant target of salicylate in vivo, we overexpressed
exogenous p300 at different levels and determined whether it suppresses the effect of salicylate on
histone H2B acetylation. HEK293T cells were transfected with wild type (WT) p300, catalytically inac-
tive p300 Y1503A and F1504A mutants (Suzuki et al., 2000), or PCAF, and the acetylation state of
H2BK12/15 was assessed after salicylate treatment. Overexpression of WT p300 suppressed the effect
of salicylate in a dose-dependent manner and increased H2BK12/K15 acetylation (Figure 2B), but
overexpression of catalytically inactive p300 mutants (Figure 2C) and PCAF did not (Figure 2D and
Figure 2—figure supplement 2). Furthermore, the IC50 of salicylate strongly correlated with the
amount of transfected p300 but not PCAF (Figure 2E). These findings support the hypothesis that
salicylate-mediated H2B deacetylation is specifically due to inhibition of p300 acetyltransferase
activity.
To determine whether salicylate down-regulates the acetylation of non-histone proteins, we over-
expressed NF-kB and p53 in 293T cells, treated the cells with salicylate, and assessed acetylation of
these proteins with specific antibody against acetyl NF-kBK310 and acetyl p53K382 (Figure 2F and G).
Salicylate decreased acetylation of both NF-kB and p53 in a dose-dependent manner. These findings
strongly support the hypothesis that p300 acetyltransferase activity is a biologically relevant target
for salicylate in vivo in cultured cells.
Recently, salicylate was reported to activate AMPK by allosteric binding to its AMP binding site.
(Hawley et al., 2012) To confirm this finding, we treated HEK293T cells with various doses of salicy-
late. The levels of a phosphorylated form of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), an established AMPK tar-
get, increased in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 2G). Compound C, an AMPK inhibitor,
suppressed p-ACC accumulation in response to salicylate, but did not inhibit deacetylation of

PCAF, treated with sodium salicylate for 24 hr, and analyzed by Western blotting analysis with an antiserum specific for acetyl histone H2BK12/K15. Bands
were quantified with Image J software. Acetylation was normalized to that of untreated control. Average levels of relative acetylation are plotted and
error bars indicate SEM. Representative results are shown in Supplementary Figure 2—figure supplement 2. (E) IC50 values generated from all curves

 acetylated H2BK12/K15 or acetyl-p53K382. This experiment demonstrates that salicylate-mediated pro-
tein deacetylation is not dependent on AMPK activation and activity (Figure 2G).
Structural homology search identifies diflunisal as a potent p300
inhibitor
Next, we tested a series of other drugs that contain a salicylic acid moiety. A substructural homology
search of the DrugBank database (www.drugbank.ca) (Wishart et al., 2006; 2008) identified five
additional FDA-approved drugs: 4-aminosalicylic acid, 5-aminosalicylic acid, diflunisal, mycophenolic
acid, and repaglinide that contain salicylic acid. We tested their ability to inhibit CBP/p300 acetyl-
transferase activity in in vitro HAT assays. All five drugs inhibited p300 with different IC50 (Figure 3A
and B). Three of the drugs inhibited p300 more potently than salicylate: the antidiabetes drug repa-
glinide (IC50 = 374 mM), the immunosuppressant mycophenolic acid (IC50 = 664 mM), and diflunisal,
an older nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (IC50 = 996 mM) (Figure 3, A and B).
Since repaglinide induces insulin secretion at nanomolar concentration, it is likely that its ability to
inhibit p300 with an IC50 of 374 mM is irrelevant to its antidiabetic activity. We therefore selected
diflunisal for further analysis. Diflunisal induced deacetylation of specific histone residues, H2AK5, K9,
H2BK12/K15, H3K56 (Figure 3C and Figure 3—figure supplement 1), a pattern of histone acetylation
similar to that induced by salicylate. Importantly, the IC50 for H2BK12/K15 inhibition in cells was
160 mM, which is within the range of plasma concentrations of diflunisal (150–350 mM) after daily
oral administration (Nuernberg et al., 1991; Mano et al., 2006). Overexpression of WT p300 sup-
pressed the effect of diflunisal in a dose-dependent manner and increased H2BK12/K15 acetylation
(Figure 3D, Figure 3—figure supplement 2), but overexpression of catalytically inactive p300
mutants did not (Figure 3E, Figure 3—figure supplement 2). Diflunisal also suppressed acetylation
of the nonhistone proteins NF-kB p65K310 (Figure 3F) and p53K382 (Figure 3G). Here also, Com-
pound C, an AMPK inhibitor, suppressed p-ACC accumulation in response to diflunisal, but did not
inhibit deacetylation of acetylated H2BK12/K15 or acetyl-p53K382, indicating that AMPK is not neces-
sary for these effects (Figure 3G). These findings support the model that diflunisal also targets p300
acetyltransferase activity independently of AMPK.
Salicylate and diflunisal decrease acetylation of AML1-ETOK43/K24 and
block the growth of t(8;21) leukemia cells by inducing apoptosis
Previously, we reported that the leukemogenicity of the AML1-ETO fusion protein, generated by a
t(8;21) translocation in acute myelogenous leukemia, is regulated by p300-mediated acetylation of
lysine 43 of the fusion protein (Wang et al., 2011). To investigate a potential application of our
newly characterized salicylate- and diflunisal-mediated inhibition of CBP/p300 activity, we tested the
effects of various doses of salicylate and diflunisal on two AML1-ETO expressing cancer cell lines
(human Kasumi-1 cells and a mouse AE9a-driven AML cell line that we generated). In support of our
model, K24 and K43 acetylation of AML1-ETO were decreased in a dose-dependent manner by
salicylate (Figure 4A, left) and by diflunisal (Figure 4A, right). Salicylate inhibited cell proliferation at

 concentrations as low as 1 mM (Figure 4B). This growth inhibition was caused in part by increased
apoptosis, as shown by annexin V/7AAD double staining (Figure 4C). Diflunisal also increased apo-
ptosis in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 4D). Additional measurements of nuclear DNA distribu-
tion showed a dose-dependent increase of the sub-G1 cell fraction, highly suggestive of apoptotic
fragmentation by salicylate (Figure 4E) and diflunisal (Figure 4F). We also noted an increased frac-
tion of G1 cells and a decreased fraction of S and G2/M cells after salicylate treatment, consistent
with reports that CBP/p300 is required for the G1/S transition (data not shown) (Ait-Si-Ali et al.,
2000; Iyer et al., 2007). Salicylate did not affect the surface expression of differentiation-related
antigens (CD11b and CD34 in Kasumi-1, Mac-1 and C-kit in AE9a) (data not shown), in accordance
with our previous finding that acetylation of AML1-ETO is required for self-renewal and leukemogen-
esis but not for its ability to block cell differentiation (Wang et al., 2011). To further test whether
p300 is the relevant target of diflunisal in Kasumi-1 cells, we transduced lentiviral expression vectors
for p300 or empty control into Kasumi-1 cells (Figure 4G). Cells transduced with the empty vector
showed inhibition of growth by diflunisal, similar to untransduced cells (Figure 4H). In contrast,
p300-transduced cells were significantly more resistant to diflunisal (Figure 4H and I), and exhibit
less apoptotis measured by annexin V positive cells (Figure 4J) and sub-G1 fraction (Figure 4K).
These results support the model that diflunisal kills Kasumi-1 cells by apoptosis due to p300
inhibition.
Salicylate and diflunisal inhibit AML1-ETO leukemia cell growth in mice
Finally, to examine whether diflunisal inhibits leukemia development in vivo, we inoculated SCID
mice with Kasumi-1 cells. Starting 3 weeks after inoculation, the mice were treated daily with diflu-
nisal (50 or 100 mg/kg orally) or vehicle. Diflunisal reduced tumor volumes in a dose-dependent
manner (Figure 5A) and had minimal effects on body weight (Figure 5B). After 3 weeks of treat-
ment, the tumors were significantly smaller in diflunisal-treated mice than in vehicle-treated controls
(Figure 5C), and most of the tumors had disappeared in mice treated with the higher dose of diflu-
nisal (Figure 5D).
Discussion
This study shows that salicylate inhibits CBP/p300 acetyltransferase activity by directly competing
with acetyl-CoA, and it down-regulates the specific acetylation of histones and non-histone proteins
in cells. We also found that diflunisal, an FDA-approved drug containing a salicylic acid substructure,
inhibited CBP/p300 more potently than salicylate. Both drugs inhibited p300-dependent AML-ETO
leukemic cell growth in vitro and in vivo. Thus, diflunisal and salicylate have promise as a oral therapy
for patients with acute myelogenous leukemia associated with a t(8;21) translocation, an exciting
potential application of our observations..
In plants, from where it was originally isolated, salicylate acts as an immune signal to induce sys-
temic acquired resistance. It specifically activates the transcription cofactor NPR1 (nonexpressor of
PR genes 1) by binding to its paralogs NPR3 and NPR4 (Fu et al., 2012). Since plants contain an
ortholog of p300/CBP (Bordoli et al., 2001), some of its activities in plants could also be mediated
by inhibition of the plant ortholog of p300 or CBP.
In animals, salicylate is an extensively studied small compound widely used as an anti-inflamma-
tory drug. Many mechanisms of action have been proposed for the anti-inflammatory effects of salic-
ylate in mammalian cells, including weak inhibition of cyclooxygenase (Warner et al., 1999),
inhibition of IKKb inhibition (Yin et al., 1998) and topoisomerase II (Cox et al., 2011), modulation of
NF-kB (Kopp and Ghosh, 1994), and activation of AMPK (Hawley et al., 2012). The simple struc-
ture of salicylate might enable it to interact with different affinities with many cellular proteins, which
could explain its pleiotropic effects. While we cannot completely rule out the possibility that the
effects of salicylate on acetylation may derive in part from off-target effects, in addition to the direct
interaction with CBP/p300 reported here, our study demonstrate a direct inhibition of p300 and CBP
by salicylate, diflunisal and their metabolites (see discussion below).
We observed that the acetylation of both histones and non-histone proteins (NF-kB) is sup-
pressed in cells treated with either salicylate or diflunisal. We identified histone AcH3K56 as the
most sensitive histone acetyl mark to inhibition by both drugs. This results is highly consistent with
the literature showing that CBP (also known as Nejire) in flies and CBP and p300 in humans acetylate

 H3K56 (Das et al., 2009). We also note that the pattern of histone marks inhibition are remarkably
similar between the two drugs, but at different concentrations in agreement with their relative abili-
ties to inhibit p300/CBP in vitro. In terms of what is observed for the other histone aceylated sites,
the situation is more complex. Indeed, many histone modifications are regulated by multiple HAT
enzymes. For example, acetyl H4K5 is regulated by HAT1, CBP, p300, Tip60, HB01 whereas acetyl
H3 K14 is regulated by CBP, p300, PCAF, gcn5, ScSAS3 (Kouzarides, 2007). We therefore interpret
the observed lack of inhibition of some histone H3 or H4 acetylation sites by salicylate or diflunisal
to reflect the compensating activities or other histone acetyltransferases that target the same sites.
We also observed inhibition of NF-kB acetylation by both salicylate and diflunisal (Figures 2D
and 3D). The NF-kB subunit RelA is acetylated on lysines 218, 221, and 310 and these modifications
are required for full NF-kB activation (Chen et al., 2001; 2002). Therefore, salicylate’s NF-kB inhibi-
tory effect can be at least partly explained by p300 inhibition. AMPK is reported to inhibit p300 ace-
tyltransferase activity by phosphorylating p300 at serine 89 (Zhang et al., 2011), suggesting that
AMPK activation by allosteric salicylate binding might inhibit p300 indirectly. However, our findings
clearly showed that salicylate does not inhibit p300 by activating AMPK since the p300 inhibition is
insensitive to an AMPK inhibitor (Figure 2G).
Overall, our findings suggest that many of the pleiotropic effects of salicylate on different cell
types and in diseases, including leukemia, are mediated by specific inhibition of CBP/p300 acetyl-
transferase activity, leading to deacetylation of histones and non-histone proteins.
Interestingly, the IC50 for p300 inhibition by both salicylic acid and diflunisal was significantly
lower in HEK293T cells (Figure 2A) than in HAT assays in vitro (Figure 1A). A number of mechanisms
discussed below could account for these differences.
First, AMPK activation in cells might enhance the p300 inhibitory effect of salicylate in cells
(Zhang et al., 2011).
Second, we have also observed that short-term treatment of cells with salicylate or diflunisal is
associated with a decreased in the expression p300 (see Figure 2F and 3D). This phenomenon is
accentuated when cells are treated longer with salicylate or diflunisal (data not shown). Other mole-
cules have been shown to induce p300 degradation through the activation of different signaling
transduction cascades (Chen and Li, 2011) and the autoacetylation of p300 is important for its enzy-
matic activity (Thompson et al., 2004). While we have not further explored this interesting observa-
tion here, we could envisage a mechanism by which inhibition of p300 autoacetylation would both
contribute to the inactivation of the enzyme but also to a change in its stability.
Third, metabolism of salicylic acid and diflunisal may also contribute to increased cellular potency
in vivo. Indeed, we have found that salicyl-CoA, a known major intermediate of salicylate metabolism
(Knights et al., 2007), inhibits CBP/p300 with 28-fold increased potency in comparison with salicy-
late: IC50=220 mM for salicyl-CoA vs 6.12 mM for salicylate (Figure 1—figure supplement 1). A simi-
lar 52-fold increase in potency is observed with diflunisal-CoA in comparison to diflunisal: IC50=20
mM for diflunisal-CoA vs 1.05 mM for diflunisal (Figure 1—figure supplement 1). Although further
investigation will be required to understand the relative contribution of both salicylic acid, diflunisal
and their metabolites to the novel in vivo effects of salicylate reported here, these observations pro-
vide a potential mechanistic basis for the potent cell-based effects of these compounds.
Fourth, it should be noted that a fragment of p300 consisting of its HAT domain is used in our in
vitro experiments and in all other published studies using recombinant p300 protein. It is possible
that the sensitivity of this subdomain to salicylate inhibition might be significantly different from the
full-length protein present in cells.

 Most of the non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) inhibit both COX-1 and COX-2,
although they vary in their relative potencies against the two isozymes (Patrignani et al., 1997).
However, salicylate does not, unlike its acetylated derivative aspirin, inhibit COX-1 and COX-2 activ-
ity in vitro (Vane, 1971) (Vargaftig, 1978; Mitchell et al., 1993); (Cromlish and Kennedy, 1996).
However, salicylate has been shown to exert a comparable analgesic and anti-inflammatory action as
aspirin. Salicylates have been proposed to exert their pharmacological effects via inhibition of the
transcription factor nuclear factor NF-|B and other targets. In these experimental systems, the con-
centrations used were in the same range as used in the experiments described in our paper (5–
20 mM)
(Kopp
and
Ghosh,
1994)
(Pierce
et
al.,
1996;
Oeth
and
Mackman,
1995;
Schwenger et al., 1996; 1997; 1999).
Further, it should also be noted that salicylate plasma concentrations in patients taking salicylic
acid (3–4 g/day) range between 1–3 mM, a concentration at which partial inhibition of p300/CBP is
observed. These data are therefore consistent with the proposed model that partial or complete
inhibition of p300 by salicylate represents one of its relevant biological targets. It is important to
note that a small molecule the size of salicylic acid used at such high concentrations is expected to
interact with a number of cellular proteins and that our discovery that salicylic acid targets p300
does not imply that previous targets are not also part of the cellular response to these drugs.

 Several other FDA-approved drugs with substructures similar to that of salicylate also directly
inhibited p300 acetyltransferase activity (Figure 3A). The salicylate substructure is now identified in
three HAT inhibitors, including anacardic acid (6-nonadecyl salicylic acid) (Balasubramanyam et al.,
2003), salicylic acid and diflunisal and might therefore represent an important scaffold for develop-
ing new p300 inhibitors.
Recently, p300 has emerged as a potential therapeutic target for respiratory diseases, HIV infec-
tion, metabolic diseases, and cancer (Dekker and Haisma, 2009). Indeed, our findings show that
salicylate and the related compound diflunisal exhibit anti-tumor activity against a specific leukemia
carrying a t(8;21) translocation, a tumor previously reported to be dependent on p300 in vitro and in
vivo (Wang et al., 2011). We have tested whether other NSAIDs, including acetaminophen and
indomethacin, also inhibit p300 acetyltransferase in vitro, but did not detect any inhibitory activity
(data not shown). Importantly, NSAIDs that lack p300 inhibitory activity failed to inhibit Kasumi-1
cells growth (data not shown).
These results identify a novel epigenetic therapeutic target for salicylate, the epigenetic regulator
CBP/p300. Further efforts will focus on unraveling the relative roles of different cellular targets of
salicylate, such as CBP/p300, cyclooxygenases, IKKb, and AMPK. Our results also suggest that salicy-
late may be useful for treating inflammation, diabetes, neurodegenerative disease, and other pathol-
ogies in which CBP/p300 has a critical role.
Materials and methods
In vitro HAT assay
Recombinant HAT (1 mg), either p300, CBP, PCAF, or GCN5 (Enzo Life Sciences), and 10 mg of his-
tones (Sigma) were incubated with sodium salicylate (Sigma) in reaction buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH
8.0, 10% glycerol, 1 mM) at 30˚C for 30 min and then with 0.1 mCi of 14C acetyl-CoA at 30˚C for
60 min. Reactions were stopped by adding 6x sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The gels
were dried, and signals were obtained by autoradiography and quantified with Image J software. To
quantify acetylated histone levels, we generated a standard curve from signals of lanes loaded with
2.5, 5, and 10 g of 14C labeled histones.
Thermal stability assay
A thermal stability assay was used to assess the binding of salicylate to the p300 HAT domain. A
p300 HAT domain construct (residues 1279–1666) bearing an inactivating Tyr1467Phe mutation to
facilitate purification of homogeneously hypoacetyalted p300 was cloned into a pET-DUET vector
with an N-terminal 6-His tag and expressed in BL21 (DE3) E. coli cells. Cells were grown at 37˚C until
they reached an optical density (600 nm) of 0.8, incubated with 0.5 mM IPTG (Isopropyl b-D-1-thio-
galactopyranoside) overnight at 18˚C to induce protein expression, harvested, and lysed by sonica-
tion in lysis buffer (25 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, and 5 mM �-mercaptoethanol). The lysate
was cleared by centrifugation and applied to a Ni-NTA affinity column. The protein was eluted from
the column with increasing concentrations of imidazole in lysis buffer (20–250 mM) and treated over-
night with TEV protease to cleave the 6-His tag. The protein was further purified by passage through
a HiTrap SP HP ion-exchange column and a size-exclusion Superdex 200 column equilibrated with
25 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, and 5 mM -mercaptoethanol.
X-ray crystallography showed that the purified p300 HAT domain protein binds to acetyl-CoA or
CoA (apparently from the bacterial cell) (Maksimoska et al., 2014) In thermal stability experiments
in a 384-well ABI plate (Applied Biosystems), the p300 HAT domain bound to acetyl-CoA/CoA was
incubated with increasing concentrations of sodium salicylate for 30 min. The final concentration of
p300 was 2 mM in reaction buffer (0.1 M HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, and 5 mM -mercaptoetha-
nol). Then, 4 ml of a 1:200 dilution of stock SYPRO orange dye (Invitrogen) in reaction buffer was
added to achieve a total reaction volume of 20 ml. Thermal melt curves were obtained by heating
the protein from 20–95˚C and monitoring fluorescence at 590 nm with a 7900HT Fast Real Time PCR
System (Applied Biosystems). All curves were obtained in triplicate and averaged.

 Evaluation of NSAID-CoA metabolites as p300 inhibitors
Salicyl-CoA and diflunisal-CoA were synthesized from their parent carboxylic acids and HPLC puri-
fied according to previously reported methods (Padmakumar et al., 1997). The purity of each acyl-
CoA was confirmed by analytical HPLC prior immediately prior to utilization (Montgomery et al.,
2014; Fanslau et al., 2010). P300 inhibition assays were performed using direct microfluidic mobility
shift analysis as previously described. Briefly, p300 reaction mixture (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mM
NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 2 mM DTT, 0.05% Triton-X-100, 50 nM p300, 2 mM FITC-histone H4 peptide)
was plated in 384-well plates and allowed to equilibrate at room temperature for 10 min. Reactions
were initiated by addition of acetyl-CoA (final concentration = 5 mM), bringing the final assay volume
to 30 mL. Assays were quenched after 10 min (<15% product accumulation) by addition of 5 mL of
0.5 M neutral hydroxylamine and transferred to a Perkin-Elmer Lab-Chip EZ-Reader instrument for
analysis. Separation conditions were: downstream voltage of �500 V, upstream voltage of �2500 V,
and a pressure of �1.5 psi. Percent conversion was calculated by ratiometric measurement of sub-
strate/product peak heights. Percent activity represents the percent conversion of KAT reactions
treated with inhibitors relative to untreated control KAT reactions, and corrected for nonenzymatic
acetylation. Dose-response analysis of p300 inhibition was performed in triplicate and analyzed by
nonlinear least-squares regression fit to Y = 100/(1 + 10^(Log IC50 – X)*H), where H = Hill slope (var-
iable). IC50 values represent the concentration that inhibits 50% of KAT activity. Calculations were
performed using Prism 6 (GraphPad) software.
Cell culture
HEK293T cells (ATCC) were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS. The viability of
Kasumi-1 cells and AE9a mouse leukemia cells was assessed in triplicate by trypan blue exclusion.
The

negative mycoplasma cultures were used during the conduct of these experiments.
Plasmids
pCi-p300 and pCi-PCAF are described elsewhere (Boyes et al., 1998). pcDNA3/myc-p300 and
pcDNA3/T7-p65 were described previously (Chen et al., 2001). pCi-p300 Y1503A, F1504A and
pcDNA3/T7-p65 K310R were constructed by using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit
(Promega). Lentiviral plasmids, pCSII-CMV-MCS, pCAG-HIVgp, pCMV-VSV-G-RSV-Rev are kindly
provided by H Miyoshi, RIKEN BioResource Center, Tsukuba, Japan (Bai et al., 2003). p300 CDS
was cloned into XhoI/NotI site of pCSII-CMV-MCS.
Western blot and antibodies
HEK293T cells were treated with sodium salicylate for 24 hr and lysed in lysis buffer (25 mM Tris, pH
6.8, 2% SDS, and 8% glycerol). For Western blot analysis, we used antibodies against acetyl histone
H2AK5 (ab1764, Abcam), acetyl histone H2AK9 (ab47816, Abcam), acetyl histone H2BK12/K15 (ab1759,
Abcam), acetyl histone H3K9 (06–942, Millipore), acetyl histone H3K14 (12–359, Millipore), acetyl his-
tone H3K27 (07–360, Millipore), acetyl histone H3K36 (07–540, Millipore), acetyl histone H3K56 (2134–
1, Epitomics), acetyl histone H4K5 (06-759-MN, Millipore), acetyl histone H4K8 (06-760-MN, Milli-
pore), acetyl histone H4K12 (6-761-MN, Millipore), acetyl histone H4K16 (06-762-MN, Millipore), his-
tone H2A (07–146, Millipore), histone H2B (ab1790, Abcam), histone H3 (07–690, Millipore), histone
H4 (07–108, Millipore), p300 (ab3164, Abcam), PCAF (ab96510, Abcam), tubulin (T6074, Sigma),
acetyl NF-kB p65K310 (3045, Cell Signaling), NF-kB p65 (sc-372, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and ace-
tyl lysine (9441, Cell Signaling).
Lentiviral transduction
pCSII-CMV-MCS vectors and packaging plasmids were transfected to HEK293T cells, supernatant
were collected and ultracentrifuged 48 hr after transfection. Same amount as p24 levels of lentivi-
ruses contain empty or p300 expression vectors were transduced to Kasumi-1 cells.

 Immunoprecipitation assay
Kasumi-1 cells were treated with sodium salicylate or diflunisal for 24 hr and lysed in RIPA buffer.
AML1-ETO protein in the lysate was immunoprecipitated with an anti-ETO antibody (Santa Cruz Bio-
technology). Antibodies against AML1 and acetylated AML1-ETO K24/K43 (generated in the Nimer
lab) were used for Western blotting.
Flow cytometry
Apoptosis was analyzed with an Annexin V-APC/7AAD Apoptosis kit (Becton-Dickinson) according
to manufacturer’s instructions. To assess the distribution of nuclear DNA content in the cell-cycle
analysis, cells were collected, washed in PBS, fixed overnight in 75% ethanol at –20˚C, treated with
1% RNase A for at least 15 min at 37˚C, and stained with 50 mg/ml propidium iodide. To monitor
CD34 expression, the cells were stained with an allophycocyanin-conjugated anti-CD34 antibody
(Becton Dickinson). To monitor CD11b expression, the cells were stained with a phycoerythrin-conju-
gated anti-CD11b antibody (Beckman-Coulter). To monitor C-kit and Mac-1 expression, the cells
were stained with allophycocyanin-conjugated anti-C-kit and phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-Mac-1
antibodies (Becton-Dickinson). Cells were sorted with a Becton-Dickinson FACSCalibur, and the data
were analyzed with FlowJo software.
Xenograft model
Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice were injected with 30 million Kasumi-1 cells in
100 ml of PBS and 100 ml of Matrigel. Three weeks after inoculation, when tumors can be detected,
mice were treated daily with oral diflunisal (50 or 100 mg/kg) or vehicle. Tumor volume and body
weight were recorded every 2 days. After 3 weeks of treatment, the mice were killed and tumor size
and body weight were recorded. All mice were maintained according to National Institutes of Health
guidelines and all animal use protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee.
