O
bjective: To assess the economic impact of providing real time continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) for people with type 1 
diabetes (T1D) and impaired awareness of hypoglycaemia (IAH) within North West (NW) London clinical commissioning groups 
(CCGs). Methods: The eligible population for CGM and inputs for the economic budget impact model developed were derived from 
published data. The model includes cost of CGM; cost savings associated with lower hypoglycaemia related hospital admissions, accidents 
and emergency visits; self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) strip usage; and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) reduction-related avoided 
complications and insulin pump use. Results: The cost of CGM for T1D-IAH (n=3,036) in the first year is £10,770,671 and in the fourth year is 
£11,329,095. The combined cost off-sets related to reduced hypoglycaemia admissions, SMBG strip usage and complications are £8,116,912 
and £8,741,026 in years one and four, respectively. The net budget impact within the NW London CCGs is £2,653,760; £2,588,068 in years one 
and four respectively. Conclusions: Introduction of CGM for T1D-IAH patients will have a minimal budget impact on NW London CCGs, driven 
by cost of CGM and offsets from lower hypoglycaemia-related costs, reduced SMBG strip usage, avoided HbA1c-related complications and 
lower insulin pump use.

About 10% of adults with diabetes in the United Kingdom (UK) have type 1 diabetes (T1D) and are 
treated by daily insulin doses – taken either by injections or via an insulin pump.1 Diabetes is a 
leading cause of morbidity and mortality and is associated with substantial healthcare and societal 
costs. The cost of diabetes to the National Health Service (NHS) is over £1.5m an hour or 10% of 
the total NHS budget for England and Wales. This equates to over £25,000 being spent on diabetes 
every minute.2 Intensive therapy that lowers average glucose levels has been shown to reduce the 
risk of the long-term complications of diabetes but it also increases the risk of hypoglycaemia,3–5 
which results in significant morbidity and mortality and may cause fear of hypoglycaemia which is 
a major barrier to optimising glucose control.2 
Real-time continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is the most advanced glucose monitoring 
technology that continuously measures interstitial glucose levels, displays the current glucose 
level and direction and rate of change, and uses alarms and alerts to inform patients and 
caregivers when glucose levels are exceeding or falling below specified thresholds.6,7 This 
complete picture of glycaemic activity helps guide diabetes management decisions (e.g., insulin 
dosage adjustments, changes in diet) to avoid glycaemic excursions.6,7 In the recently conducted 
DIAMOND randomised controlled trial (RCT) in T1D participants on multiple daily injections (MDI) 
with a mean baseline glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) of 70 mmol/mol (8.6%), there was a 10.9 
mmol/mol (1%) demonstrated reduction in HbA1c for the CGM group compared with 4.4 mmol/mol 
(0.4%) reduction in the self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) group at 24 weeks from baseline. 
Participants in the CGM group also spent significantly less time (p=0.002) in hypoglycaemia (duration 
of hypoglycaemia) at <2.8 mmol/L, <3.3 mmol/L and <3.9 mmol/L; had a significant reduction in 
diabetes distress (p<0.001); less fear of hypoglycaemia (p=0.02); and an increase in hypoglycaemia 
confidence (p<0.001) and well-being (p=0.01), compared with conventionally monitored patients 
using SMBG alone.8,9 Similarly, in the GOLD RCT, T1D participants on MDI and HbA1c above target, a 
significant reduction in HbA1c was seen using CGM compared with SMBG alone.10 
Recurrent hypoglycaemia induces a maladaptive response that impairs the ability of patients to 
detect the early warning signs of hypoglycaemia, a condition known as impaired awareness of 
hypoglycaemia (IAH). IAH significantly increases the risk of severe hypoglycaemia, which requires 
assistance from a third party to treat11 and often requires costly emergency medical care.12 Tools 
are needed that can help people with insulin-treated diabetes to lower their blood glucose levels

without increasing their risk of hypoglycaemia, which can potentially 
reduce the incidence of severe hypoglycaemia in people at risk for 
this costly and potentially fatal adverse event. For people with IAH, the 
alarm function of CGM devices may be their only warning of emerging 
hypoglycaemia. In contrast, traditional fingerstick SMBG, which provides 
intermittent and limited information about blood glucose concentrations 
at single point in time,6,13 may fail to detect any potentially dangerous 
glycemic excursions even when diligently performed.6,7
The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends 
the use of CGM in their NG17 guidelines for adults with T1D who have any 
of the following despite optimised use of insulin therapy and conventional 
SMBG: 1. more than one episode a year of severe hypoglycaemia 
with no obviously preventable precipitating cause; 2. complete loss 
of awareness of hypoglycaemia; 3. frequent (more than 2 episodes 
a week) asymptomatic hypoglycaemia that is causing problems with 
daily activities; 4. extreme fear of hypoglycaemia and 5. hyperglycaemia 
(HbA1c level of 75 mmol/mol [9%] or higher) that persists despite SMBG 
testing at least 10 times a day.14 
In 2016, the North West London clinical commissioning groups (NW 
London CCGs) board approved a proposal to commission CGM for a 
defined cohort of T1D patients, in line with NICE NG17.15 
With access to CGM secured in NW London CCGs, this study specifically 
estimates the budget impact of providing CGM for the highest-risk sub-
group of T1D patients with IAH.
Methods
Model structure
This analysis evaluates the budgetary impact of providing CGM devices 
with alarms for people with T1D and IAH within NW London CCGs in 
England over a 4-year period. The starting cohort for the model was 
the entire population of NW London CCGs of Brent, Hillingdon, Harrow, 
Hounslow, Ealing, West London, Central London, Hammersmith and 
Fulham. The model was developed using Microsoft Excel (version 2016).
Using the data on age-distribution and diabetes prevalence within 
these CCGs, a cohort of people with T1D was created from the starting 
population. Finally, using the prevalence of IAH, the model arrived at the 
target population of people with both T1D and IAH. Age-specific and T1D-
specific severe hypoglycaemia event rates were applied to the model 
cohort (references listed in Table 1). The model included only direct costs 
due to severe hypoglycaemia related health services utilisation such as 
ambulance call-outs, emergency attendance and hospital admissions. 
Costs related to SMBG as well as direct costs related to progression 
to complications and insulin pump usage in the short-term were also 
included in the model.
The number of severe hypoglycaemic (SH) events, the number of finger 
sticks used for SMBG by persons with diabetes (PwD)-IAH, and associated 
costs, were evaluated for both the non-intervention (SMBG only) and CGM 
intervention scenarios. For the CGM intervention scenario, reductions in 
rates of SH events were applied to the base case event rates. This rate of 
reduction was based on published clinical trials (references listed in Table 
2). Sensitivity analyses were conducted by varying key model inputs and 
assumptions in order to assess the robustness of the model results. 
Model inputs and parameter assumptions
The population of NW London CCGs was derived from the general 
practitioner (GP) registrations used by NHS England to build the financial 
allocation model for 2016–2017 budgets. The registrations represent all 
age-groups so that the population registered are adjusted to equal the 
NHS England estimate of actual population.16 
The prevalence of diabetes in persons over 16 years of age was estimated 
from the diabetes prevalence model estimates for local authorities by 
Public Health England.17 Of these, 10% of the diabetes patients were 
estimated to have T1D.1 The prevalence of T1D in children was estimated 
to be 187.7 per 100,000 people based on National Paediatric Diabetes 
Audit report.18 For persons with T1D, it was estimated that 20% of the 
persons over or equal to16 years of age and 29% of the persons under 16 
years of age have IAH based on published literature (Table 1).19,20 
Thus, the target population for this budget impact analysis was PwD-
IAH. The incidence of SH events for T1D was derived from published 
literature. Five studies of children and adolescents with T1D have 
reported rates of severe hypoglycaemia ranging from 0.16–0.38 episodes 
per patient-year.20–23 The median incidence rate from these studies was 
0.32 per patient-year after pooling the patients together. This is very 
close to the incidence rate for severe hypoglycaemia seen in the Katz et 
al. study that included children up to 15 years of age (0.38 per patient-

*The estimate of prevalence of T1D in children in England is 187.7 per 100,000. 
Number of T1D patients was directly estimated from the population aged  
<16 years in NW London CCGs. This is because the diabetes prevalence model 
estimates for local authorities by Public Health England gave the prevalence estimates 
for population ≥16 years only so the prevalence estimates for population <16 years 
had to be derived separately. CCGs = clinical commissioning groups; IAH = impaired 
awareness of hypoglycaemia; T1D = type 1 diabetes.

*NICE guideline NG18 recommends self-monitoring ≥5 times per day in children, and 
one study in the report had a 90th percentile frequency of SMBG of 37/week. The 
target population will have diabetes that is more difficult to manage than average, and 
many will wish to test more often because of a fear of hypoglycaemia. On this basis, 
the model assumes a testing frequency of eight per day. CGM = continuous glucose

year).23 Incidence rates for severe hypoglycaemia in adults with T1D 
range from 0.7–3.2 events per patient-year, with most studies reporting 
an incidence of ~1 episode per patient-year.24–31 Based on the review 
of the evidence published in literature, we assumed the annual rate of 
severe hypoglycaemia in the general adult T1DM population to be ~1 
episode per patient-year, which we believe is a conservative estimate. 
It was assumed that on average children with T1D experience 0.32 SH 
events and adults experience one SH episode per year. Importantly, for 
this model, people that have IAH will have a six-fold increase in risk for 
hypoglycaemia.19,32 
The percentage of SH events resulting in hospitalisations, accident and 
emergency (A&E) visits and ambulance call-outs were derived from a 
UK study and are shown in Table 2. The IN-CONTROL trial, a randomised, 
open-label crossover study, found that CGM reduced the incidence of 
SH events by 59% in PwD-IAH,33 which is what was used in the analyses. 
All other key inputs can be seen in Table 2. In the recently conducted 
DIAMOND RCT in people with T1D on MDI, patients who received CGM 
had a 6.6 mmol/mol (0.6%) greater reduction in HbA1c compared to 
those who used SMBG.8 Long-term (~11 years) follow-up data from 
studies such as the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) 
demonstrate that compared with patients who received conventional 
diabetes management, patients who were intensively treated during the 
DCCT experienced a significant (42%) reduction in cardiovascular (CV) 
events as well as a significant (57%) decrease in non-fatal myocardial 
infarctions, strokes, and CV deaths.34 Analyses performed 20 years after 
the DCCT showed that a mean of 6.5 years of intensive therapy aimed 
at achieving near-normal glucose levels reduced the risk of development 
and progression of retinopathy by as much as 76% compared with 
conventional therapy.35
The NICE guidance recommends insulin pump for T1D adults and 
children 12 years and older provided that: 1. attempts to achieve target 
HbA1c levels with MDI result in the person experiencing disabling 
hypoglycaemia, or 2. HbA1c levels have remained high (that is, at 8.5% 
[69 mmol/mol] or above) on MDI therapy (including, if appropriate, 
 
the use of long-acting insulin analogues) despite a high level of care.36 
In the DIAMOND RCT, 52% of the MDI patients with HbA1c ≥8.5% at the 
baseline achieved target blood glucose control at the end of 24 weeks 
of the trial.8 However, clinical trials are conducted in a well-controlled 
environment, so in this analysis, it is conservatively assumed that in the 
real world, as a result of using CGM with MDI, glycaemic targets will be 
attained (based on DIAMOND RCT) and 30% of the T1D-IAH population 
will not progress to insulin pump. In our model, we estimated the number 
of T1D patients ages <16 years and ≥16 years requiring insulin pump 
every year within NW London CCGs based on new pump prevalence 
from the insulin pump audit report for all of England.37 
The Dexcom G5® Mobile CGM System (San Diego, CA, US) is the only 
FDA-approved CGM device for the replacement of confirmatory self-
monitoring blood glucose measurements when making therapeutic 
decisions. Evidence from REPLACE-BG, a multicentre, randomised, 
noninferiority clinical trial demonstrates that the use of CGM without 
confirmatory SMBG is as safe and effective as using CGM adjunctive 
to SMBG in adults with T1D and an HbA1c close to target.38 Based on 
the trial results, the analyses assumes 2.8 fingersticks (2 fingersticks are 
required for CGM calibration) per day for people on CGM.
Cost inputs
The cost of ambulance call-outs, hospital admissions and A&E visits 
were derived from a database developed by New Economy and 
Her Majesty’s Government.39 The average cost savings per year 
due to avoided complications as a result of %HbA1c reduction for 
patients using CGM was derived from published literature (Table 3).40 
The cost per fingerstick was derived from published literature14 
and the cost of lancets was derived from drug tariff published 
 
by NHS.41 The cost of Dexcom G5 Mobile CGM was provided by the 
manufacturer.42 The G5 Mobile CGM system consists of an interstitial 
sensor, a transmitter and a dedicated receiver. A smart phone 
(or mobile device) can be used in lieu of the dedicated receiver. 
 
The labelled sensor usage is 7 days. The Dexcom G5 Mobile device has 
CE mark approval for use without the need for a receiver, and patients 
will use their existing smart phone to function as the CGM receiver. 
 
In this analysis, it was assumed (based on user experience) that 30% 
 
of the patients will use the G5 Mobile system receiver with the 
remainder of the patients using their mobile phone as the receiver. 
 
The model assumes 2.5% increase in prices every year in the analyses. 
All other cost inputs can be seen in Table 3.
Sensitivity analysis 
Sensitivity analysis was performed on the following parameters:
1. 
Sensor and receiver usage 
 
Sensitivity analysis was conducted on Dexcom G5 sensor usage. 
More specifically, it was assumed that sensors are replaced every 
10 days instead of 7 days in the base case. It was also assumed in 
this sensitivity scenario that patients do not use the receiver.
2. 
Fingerstick usage in SMBG group  
Sensitivity analysis was performed assuming SMBG group using 
a maximum of 10 fingersticks per day and a minimum of four 
fingersticks per day.
3. 
Reduction in SH events conferred by CGM 
 
Sensitivity analysis was performed assuming a minimum of 46% 
mean reduction in the incidence of SH based on the Juvenile 
Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF) RCT.43 Because the JDRF 
study excluded people with a history of SH and those with IAH, and 
was not powered to determine the impact of CGM on SH, the study 
may underestimate the potential efficacy of CGM for reducing SH 
in a high-risk population, and is therefore a conservative estimate. 
Sensitivity analysis was also performed using a maximum of 93% 
reduction in the incidence of SH events based on a retrospective 
audit of 35 patients with T1D and IAH.44

*Baxter et al. 2016 demonstrated cost reductions between £66 and £184 over 5 years 
from avoided complications if HbA1c was reduced by 0.4% from baseline. Based on 
this, we assume a median cost-reduction of £125 over 5 years that translates into 
cost-reduction of £25 per year due to avoided complications. If HbA1c reduction were 
equal to 1% from baseline (as seen in DIAMOND RCT for CGM), this equates to £63 in 
cost-reductions every year due to avoided complications. †Back calculated - Costing

Results 
For a population of 2,127,946 within NW London CCGs, it was estimated 
that there are 15,213 people with T1D, of whom 3,036 were estimated 
to have IAH. 
The cost of CGM for PwD-IAH (n=3,036) is £10,770,671 in year one, 
£10,783,195 in year two, £11,317,177 in year three and £11,329,095 in 
year four. The combined cost offsets related to reduced hypoglycaemia 
admissions, SMBG strips usage and complications is £8,116,912; 
£8,319,835; £8,527,830 and £8,741,026 in years one through four, 
respectively. The net budget impact within the NW London CCGs is 
£2,653,760; £2,463,361; £3,402,143; £2,588,068 in years one through four 
respectively (Table 4).
Sensitivity analysis
In sensitivity analysis, the net budget impact of introducing CGM 
within NW London CCGs is £815,094 in year one when it is assumed 
that patients use a sensor for 10 days each. This also assumes no 
receiver usage. When the number of fingersticks used by patients 
 
in the SMBG group is increased from eight fingersticks to 10 per day in 
sensitivity analysis, the net budget impact on the NW CCGs decreases 
to £2,353,219. When the number of fingersticks used by the patients in 
the SMBG group is decreased from eight fingersticks to four per day, the 
net budget impact increases to £3,254,840. When the reduction in the SH 
events is increased from 59% to 93% in the sensitivity analysis, the net 
budget impact in year one decreases to -£1,161,579 (cost-savings) and 
when the reduction in SH events is decreased from 59% to 46%, the net 
budget impact increases to £4,112,566 in year one (Table 5).
 
Discussion
The introduction of CGM for the high-risk sub-group of patients with IAH 
has a minimal budget impact (£2,653,760) in year one and remains stable 
for subsequent 3 years. Sensitivity analyses demonstrate the robustness 
of the model results and shows minimal budget impact due to CGM 
introduction in each of the scenarios assessed and cost-savings observed 
when the rate of severe hypoglycaemia reduction on CGM is increased to 
93%. The results of this model are intended to provide a population-level 
estimate of the healthcare costs and savings associated with reduction in 
SH events, decreased complications in the short-term due to optimised 
HbA1c control and reduced insulin pump usage within NW London CCGs. 
Several analyses have evaluated the cost-effectiveness of CGM in 
terms of incremental cost-effectiveness ratios and quality-adjusted 
life years.45–47 While these evaluations are important for determining 
the long-term societal impact of new medical interventions, they do 
not provide cost data in a context that is directly relevant to CCGs 
in England. This analysis adds to the literature by demonstrating the 
short-term budgetary impact of introducing real time CGM for T1D-IAH 
patients within NW London CCGs. However, this study is not without 
limitations, primarily because of the assumptions made in the model 
and data availability. Specifically, clinical trial data used to model the 
efficacy of the CGM intervention in terms of reduction in SH events for 
patients using CGM and the fingersticks usage by patients in the SMBG 
group may not be representative of the clinical benefits experienced 
in real-world practice. In order to address this limitation, one-way 
sensitivity analyses were conducted using a range of values around 
these inputs in the analyses. In addition, not all model inputs were 
available for T1D patients; therefore, certain data inputs were assumed. 
For instance, the percentage of patients delaying/avoiding going on 
insulin pumps due to better HbA1c control with CGM and MDI was 
derived from NICE guidance,36 clinical judgement/expert opinion and 
results of the DIAMOND clinical trial.8
Finally, it is important to note that short-term budget impact analysis does 
not incorporate the long-term clinical and economic benefits related to 
reduction in HbA1c and thus better glucose control in terms of reduced 
microvascular and macrovascular complications. 
Conclusions
Introduction of real time CGM for PwD-IAH will have a minimal budget 
impact on NW London CCGs, driven by cost of CGM and offsets from 
lower hypoglycaemia-related costs, reduced SMBG strip usage, avoided 
near term HbA1c-related complications and insulin pump usage. Given 
the established clinical benefits associated with CGM use compared 
with the potential budget impact, UK CCGs should consider providing 
real time CGM access to high-risk T1D patients.
