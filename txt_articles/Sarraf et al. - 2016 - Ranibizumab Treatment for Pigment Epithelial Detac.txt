Purpose:
To analyze the effect of baseline presence and height of pigment epithelial detachments (PEDs) on
visual and anatomic outcomes at 24 months in patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration
(AMD) treated with ranibizumab.
Design:
Post hoc analysis of HARBOR, a 24-month, phase III, randomized, multicenter, double-masked,
active treatmentecontrolled study (clinicaltrials.gov identifier, NCT00891735).
Participants:
One thousand ninety-seven patients with neovascular AMD.
Methods:
Intravitreal ranibizumab 0.5 mg or 2.0 mg monthly or pro re nata (PRN) after 3 monthly loading
doses.
Main Outcome Measures:
We evaluated the effect of presence and height of baseline PED on several
outcomes at 24 months, including best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), change in PED height, resolution of PED,
and number of injections in the PRN arms. Development of macular atrophy at month 24 by presence or absence
of PED was evaluated.
Results:
Five hundred ninety-eight (54.5%) patients showed PED at baseline. In the ranibizumab 0.5-mg
PRN group, mean numbers of injections were similar for patients with PED present or absent at baseline (14.0
vs. 12.5). Mean BCVA gains from baseline to 24 months were seen in all treatment groups and were comparable
in patients with or without PED at baseline treated with ranibizumab 0.5 mg monthly (PED present at
baseline, þ9.0 letters; PED absent at baseline, þ11.3 letters), 0.5 mg PRN (present, þ8.4; absent, þ7.9), 2.0 mg
monthly (present, þ7.1; absent, þ11.1), or 2.0 mg PRN (present, þ7.2; absent, þ8.8). When analyzed by baseline
PED height, mean BCVA gains were demonstrated and comparable in all treatment groups at 24 months except
for patients treated with ranibizumab 2.0 mg monthly in the extra-large group (PEDs �352 mm; mean BCVA
change, �0.8 letters). At 24 months, 53.2% (0.5 mg monthly), 44.5% (0.5 mg PRN), 70.4% (2.0 mg monthly), and
57.3% (2.0 mg PRN) of patients showed complete resolution of PED.
Conclusions:
Ranibizumab 0.5 mg given monthly or PRN effectively treated PEDs in patients with neo-
vascular AMD, and significant vision gains resulted regardless of PED status and height at baseline. In this
analysis,
there

Retinal pigment epithelial detachments (PEDs) are associ-
ated with many retinal diseases, including neovascular age-
related macular degeneration (AMD), can cause significant
vision loss, and are difficult to treat. Pigment epithelial de-
tachments are seen in up to 62% of patients with advanced
neovascular AMD.1,2 The pathogenesis of PEDs is not
completely understood,3 but PED at baseline has been
shown to be a predictor of vision loss in patients with
AMD.4
Approximately
50%
of
patients
with
newly
diagnosed PEDs will experience significant loss in visual

 therapy (Lucentis; Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco,
CA) in improving visual and anatomic outcomes in
patients with neovascular AMD. At 24 months in these
studies, 34% to 41% and 26% to 33% of ranibizumab-
treated patients, respectively, gained 15 letters or more in
best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) from baseline.7,8 In
these patients with neovascular AMD, ranibizumab was
associated with arrested or decreased growth of and leakage
from choroidal neovascularization (CNV). In other studies
of patients with neovascular AMD, the subgroups with PED
have been associated with worse visual acuity outcomes.4,5
Currently,
there
are
few
prospective
studies
that
demonstrate effective therapy for PEDs associated with
neovascular AMD. These analyses are limited by the use of
time-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) or do not
focus specifically on eyes with PED, providing incomplete
information regarding PED outcomes.9e14 The Prospective
Optical Coherence Tomography Imaging of Patients with
Neovascular AMD Treated with Intraocular Ranibizumab
study15,16 evaluated an OCT-guided dosing regimen with
ranibizumab 0.5 mg for the treatment of patients with neo-
vascular AMD. This study found no correlation between
PED at baseline or 3 months with visual acuity at 12
months. Additionally, limited data are available on the use
of higher doses (2.0 mg) of ranibizumab to treat PEDs. Chan

hypothesized
that
a
greater
concentration
of
ranibizumab may penetrate the retinal pigment epithelial
(RPE) barrier and suppress CNV, leading to more rapid
resolution of the PED. Although visual acuity outcomes
were no different at 12 months between the 2.0-mg and
0.5-mg arms, the 2.0-mg regimen did result in more rapid
reductions in percentage of PED height.17,18
The Phase III, Double-Masked, Multicenter, Random-
ized, Active Treatment-Controlled Study of the Efficacy and
Safety of 0.5 mg and 2.0 mg Ranibizumab Administered
Monthly or on an As-Needed Basis (PRN) in Patients with
Subfoveal Neovascular Age-Related Macular Degeneration
(HARBOR) was conducted to evaluate the potential bene-
ficial effects of both a higher dose and pro re nata (PRN)
dosing of ranibizumab in patients with subfoveal neo-
vascular AMD.19,20 Neither the higher dose nor the more
frequent dosing differed from their counterparts in the pri-
mary end point of mean change in BCVA from baseline to
month 12. At month 24, mean changes in BCVA from
baseline were similar among groups (þ9.1, þ7.9, þ8.0,
and þ7.6 letters in the 0.5-mg monthly, 0.5-mg PRN, 2.0-
mg monthly, and 2.0-mg PRN ranibizumab treatment
groups, respectively).20 This report describes the results of
an exploratory subgroup analysis of the HARBOR trial
that analyzed the effect of baseline PED status (present or
absent) and height on visual and anatomic outcomes in
patients with neovascular AMD treated with standard-dose
(0.5 mg) versus high-dose (2.0 mg) ranibizumab on a
monthly or PRN dosing regimen.
Methods
This study was a post hoc analysis of the HARBOR study, the
methods for which have been published previously.19 Briefly,
HARBOR was a 24-month, phase III, randomized, multicenter,
double-masked,
active
treatmentecontrolled
study
(clinical-
trials.gov identifier, NCT00891735) conducted at 100 investigator
sites. The study protocol was approved by the respective institu-
tional review boards before the start of the study. Written informed
consent was provided by all participants before study participation.
The study was conducted in accordance with Good Clinical
Practice (International Conference on Harmonization of Technical
Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use
E6), applicable United States Food and Drug Administration reg-
ulations, and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
Act.
Key inclusion criteria for the study eye included BCVA of
20/40 to 20/320 (Snellen equivalent) using Early Treatment
Diabetic Retinopathy Study charts at a distance of 4 m; active
subfoveal lesions with classic CNV, some classic CNV compo-
nent, or purely occult CNV; total area of lesion less than 12 disc
areas or 30.48 mm2; and total CNV area constituting 50% or more
of total lesion area based on fluorescein angiography.
In HARBOR, all included patients (1 eye per patient) were
randomized 1:1:1:1 to 1 of 4 ranibizumab treatment groups: 0.5 mg
monthly, 0.5 mg PRN, 2.0 mg monthly, or 2.0 mg PRN. Ran-
domized patients received 3 monthly doses of intravitreal ranibi-
zumab 0.5 mg or 2.0 mg at the beginning of the study. The
monthly groups then continued with monthly treatment, whereas
the PRN groups were evaluated every month and were re-treated if
there was a 5-letter (Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study)
or more reduction in vision from the previous visit or any evidence
of disease activity on spectral-domain OCT (Cirrus HD-OCT; Carl
Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, CA), including the presence of a PED.
Spectral-domain OCT was performed at each study visit and im-
ages were graded at baseline, day 7, and months 1 through 4, 6, 9,
12, 18, and 24.
Pigment epithelial detachment was defined as a discrete or
localized dome-shaped or irregular elevation of the RPE on OCT
that was optically empty (i.e., serous) with a focus of neo-
vascularization at the edge or that was comprised heterogeneous
tissue of mixed reflectivity or layering within the sub-PED
compartment. To evaluate the effect of baseline PED height on
outcomes, patients were separated into quartiles according to PED
height with spectral-domain OCT analysis (i.e., each group
comprised 25% of patients with PED at baseline in the study).
Pigment epithelial detachment type (i.e., serous, fibrovascular) at
baseline was not assessed during image grading. Pigment epithelial
detachment height was measured by a masked grader as the dis-
tance between the RPEeBruch’s membrane complex at the base
and the peak of the PED. After documenting PED presence at
baseline (PED height, >0 mm), if the PED height measurement was
0 at a subsequent visit, then the PED was considered completely
resolved. Pigment epithelial detachments in HARBOR ranged
from approximately 35 to 1400 mm in height at baseline. For the
quartile analysis, small PEDs were defined as 35 to 164 mm (mean
� standard deviation [SD], 126.0�27.7 mm), medium PEDs were
defined as 164.5 to 233 mm (mean � SD, 196.8�20.8 mm), large
PEDs were defined as 233.25 to 351 mm (mean � SD, 282.0�33.3
mm), and extra-large PEDs were defined as 352 to 1395.5 mm
(mean � SD, 515.6�161.7 mm) in height. This analysis was per-
formed on the intent-to-treat population, which included 1 patient
who was randomized but not treated. Only baseline values are
included for this patient. This subgroup analysis of the HARBOR

 study evaluated patients with or without PED at baseline and the
effect of baseline PED height across several exploratory end points
up to 24 months, including patients’ BCVA, change in BCVA
from baseline, resolution of PED, change in PED height from
baseline, and number of injections in the PRN treatment groups. In
addition, the development of macular atrophy was assessed at
month 24 in patients with no detectable atrophy at baseline (rani-
bizumab treatment groups pooled). Macular atrophy was identified
as a well-defined area of depigmentation with increased visibility
of choroidal vessels on either color fundus photography or fluo-
rescein angiography that was 250 mm or more in diameter and
corresponded to a flat area of well-demarcated staining on fluo-
rescein angiography. Any atrophy immediately within, adjacent to,
and nonadjacent to CNV lesions (active or regressed) was
included. Atrophy associated with RPE tears was excluded. The
atrophy analysis excluded 32 eyes for which atrophy status could
not be determined at month 24.
Statistical Analysis
Student t tests were used to compare differences in group means of
outcome measures by baseline PED status. To evaluate differences
between treatment groups and differences between quartiles,
analysis of variance and Tukey’s honest significant difference tests
were used. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS version
9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC).
Results
Of the 1097 included patients, 598 (54.5%) showed a PED at
baseline. Overall, 154 patients (0.5 mg monthly), 146 patients (0.5
mg PRN), 158 patients (2.0 mg monthly), and 140 patients (2.0 mg
PRN) showed a PED at baseline. One patient included in the
baseline analyses was randomized to ranibizumab 0.5 mg monthly
and had a medium PED, but was not treated. At baseline, patients
with PED had reduced central foveal thickness (328.6 vs. 363.1
mm) and higher BCVA (55.7 letters [approximate Snellen equiv-
alent, 20/80] vs. 51.9 letters [approximate Snellen equivalent,
20/100]) than patients without PED (P < 0.0001 for both com-
parisons; Table 1). Baseline characteristics were similar across
quartile groups and mean PED height measurements at baseline
were 126.0 mm (small), 196.8 mm (medium), 282.0 mm (large),
and 515.6 mm (extra large; Table 2). Additionally, baseline
characteristics were similar across treatment groups (Table 3).
Vision Outcomes
Pigment Epithelial Detachment Status at Baseline. Mean
BCVA gains from baseline to 24 months were similar in patients
with PED present at baseline who received any of the 4 ranibizu-
mab treatment regimens (Fig 1A). Mean BCVA gains from
baseline to 24 months were comparable in patients with or
without PED at baseline treated with ranibizumab 0.5 mg
monthly (PED present at baseline, þ9.0 letters; PED absent at
baseline, þ11.3 letters), ranibizumab 0.5 mg PRN (PED present
at baseline, þ8.4 letters; PED absent at baseline, þ7.9 letters), or
ranibizumab 2.0 mg PRN (PED present at baseline, þ7.2 letters;
PED absent at baseline, þ8.8 letters). In the ranibizumab 2.0-mg
monthly group, there was a trend toward greater mean BCVA
gains at 24 months in patients without PED at baseline (þ11.1
letters) compared with those with PED present at baseline (þ7.1
letters; P ¼ 0.08). In all ranibizumab groups combined, patients
with PED at baseline gained a mean of 7.9 letters at 24 months
from baseline compared with 9.7 letters in patients without PED at
baseline (P ¼ 0.08; Fig 1B). Because patients with PED started
with better vision than those without PED at baseline (55.7 vs.
51.9 letters), the month 24 mean BCVA also was better in
patients with PED at baseline (64.4 letters) compared with
patients without PED at baseline (62.0 letters; P ¼ 0.03).

groups at 24 months when analyzed by baseline PED height,
except for patients treated with ranibizumab 2.0 mg monthly in the
extra-large PED group (PEDs �352 mm; Fig 2A). In patients with
small PEDs, mean change from baseline in BCVA at month 24
was þ8.2 letters (0.5 mg monthly), þ10.0 letters (0.5 mg
PRN), þ11.1 letters (2.0 mg monthly), and þ6.7 letters (2.0 mg
PRN). Mean change from baseline in BCVA at month 24
was þ9.8 letters (0.5 mg monthly), þ12.3 letters (0.5 mg
PRN), þ8.3 letters (2.0 mg monthly), and þ7.9 letters (2.0 mg
PRN) in patients with medium PEDs. Patients with large PEDs
had mean BCVA gains at month 24 of þ11.3 letters (0.5 mg
monthly), þ7.7 letters (0.5 mg PRN), þ10.2 letters (2.0 mg
monthly), and þ6.4 letters (2.0 mg PRN). Mean changes from
baseline in BCVA at month 24 were þ6.4 letters (0.5 mg
monthly), þ5.3 letters (0.5 mg PRN), e0.8 letters (2.0 mg
monthly), and þ7.7 letters (2.0 mg PRN) in the extra-large PED
group. In all ranibizumab groups combined, patients gained a mean
of 9.1 letters (small), 9.0 letters (medium), 8.9 letters (large), and
4.7 letters (extra large; P ¼ 0.051; Fig 2B).
Anatomic Outcomes
Ranibizumab therapy led to resolution of PEDs in approximately
56% of patients at month 24. In patients with PED at baseline,
PEDs completely resolved in 53.2% and 44.5% of patients treated
with ranibizumab 0.5 mg monthly and 0.5 mg PRN, respectively
(Fig 3). There was a trend for greater PED resolution in eyes
treated with the 2.0-mg dose of ranibizumab (PED completely
resolved: 70.4% of patients treated with ranibizumab 2.0 mg
monthly and 57.3% of patients treated with 2.0 mg PRN). Pigment
epithelial detachment height decreased over 24 months in each
treatment group, with the greatest decrease from baseline occurring
in the ranibizumab 2.0-mg PRN treatment group (Fig 4). At month
24, the decreases in PED height from baseline were �155.9 mm
(0.5 mg monthly), �165.8 mm (0.5 mg PRN), �191.1 mm (2.0
mg monthly), and �201.6 mm (2.0 mg PRN).
Mean PED height decreased over 24 months regardless of PED
height at baseline (Fig 5). In the small, medium, and extra-large
PED groups, patients treated with ranibizumab 2.0 mg monthly
had a slightly greater mean decrease in PED height than those
treated with other ranibizumab regimens, but this difference was
not statistically significant (P ¼ 0.07). Patients with a small PED at
baseline demonstrated mean decreases in PED height at month 24
of �76.3 mm (0.5 mg monthly), �57.4 mm (0.5 mg PRN), �88.0
mm (2.0 mg monthly), and �73.3 mm (2.0 mg PRN; P ¼ 0.61). In
patients with a medium PED at baseline, mean decreases in PED
height at month 24 were �110.2 mm (0.5 mg monthly), �115.5 mm
(0.5 mg PRN), �165.0 mm (2.0 mg monthly), and �136.4 mm (2.0
mg PRN; P ¼ 0.06). In patients in the large PED group, the largest

 mean decrease in PED height at 24 months was seen with ranibi-
zumab 0.5 mg monthly (�204.5 mm) compared with �161.1 mm
(0.5 mg PRN), �199.06 mm (2.0 mg monthly), and �182.28 mm
(2.0 mg PRN; P ¼ 0.47). The largest mean decreases in PED
height overall at 24 months were seen in patients in the extra-large
PED group (ranibizumab 0.5 mg monthly, �257.3 mm; 0.5 mg
PRN, �277.4 mm; 2.0 mg monthly, �349.3 mm; 2.0 mg
PRN, �387.5 mm; P ¼ 0.08). Figure 6 shows a case example of a
patient with an extra-large PED at baseline that resolved by month
24 after ranibizumab 0.5-mg monthly treatment.
Number of Ranibizumab Injections
In patients with PED present at baseline in the ranibizumab 0.5-mg
PRN group, a similar number of injections was needed in all 4 PED
height quartiles over 2 years with the presence of PED as a re-
treatment criterion (small, 12.2 injections; medium, 13.6 in-
jections; large, 14.0 injections; extra large, 15.6 injections; P ¼
0.16; Fig 7). These patients required a mean of 14.0 injections over
2 years compared with 12.5 injections in patients with PED absent
at baseline. Patients treated with ranibizumab 0.5 mg PRN with
complete resolution of PED at month 24 required 12.7 injections
compared with 16.3 injections in patients without complete
resolution of PED (P ¼ 0.0004). In the ranibizumab 2.0-mg
PRN group, patients with PED present at baseline required a
mean of 11.6 injections over 2 years compared with 10.7 injections
in patients with PED absent at baseline. A similar number of in-
jections also was needed across PED height quartiles in the rani-
bizumab 2.0-mg PRN group over 2 years (small, 10.7 injections;
medium, 10.6 injections; large, 11.0 injections; extra large, 14.3
injections). Patients treated with ranibizumab 2.0 mg PRN with
PED resolution at month 24 required a mean of 10.9 injections
compared with 15.0 injections in patients without PED resolution
(P < 0.0001).
Macular Atrophy
Among study eyes with no detectable atrophy at baseline (all
ranibizumab groups pooled), a similar rate of macular atrophy was
seen at month 24 in eyes with PED at baseline (n ¼ 131/404
[32%]) and in eyes without PED at baseline (n ¼ 98/342 [29%];
Fig 8A). Among study eyes with PED at baseline and no detectable
atrophy at baseline (all ranibizumab groups pooled), a higher rate
of macular atrophy was present immediately within, adjacent to,
and nonadjacent to CNV lesions at month 24 in eyes with
complete flattening of PED (n ¼ 101 [44%]) than in eyes with
PED still present (n ¼ 30 [17%]; P < 0.0001; Fig 8B). Macular
atrophy development at month 24 was independent of PED size
at baseline (small, 29%, medium, 42%, large, 34%, extra large,
25%; P ¼ 0.09).
Retinal Pigment Epithelium Tear Analysis
Overall, 28 of 598 patients (4.7%) with a PED at baseline expe-
rienced an RPE tear during the study. The distribution of RPE tears
was similar across treatment groups, with a total of 5 patients (3%;
0.5 mg monthly), 6 patients (4%; 0.5 mg PRN), 7 patients (4%; 2.0
mg monthly), and 10 patients (7%; 2.0 mg PRN) who experienced
tears (P ¼ 0.44). There was no significant difference between the
development of RPE tear in patients treated with ranibizumab

 0.5 mg and 2.0 mg (P ¼ 0.24). Twenty-one of 150 patients (14%)
with an extra-large PED (�352 mm) at baseline demonstrated an
RPE tear compared with 5 of 149 patients (3%), 1 of 152 patients
(1%), and 1 of 147 patients (1%) in the large, medium, and small
PED groups, respectively (P < 0.0001). Mean changes in BCVA
from baseline to month 24 in patients with tears were þ8.0 letters
(small; n ¼ 1), þ15.0 letters (medium; n ¼ 1), þ9.3 letters (large;
n ¼ 4), and �3.6 letters (extra large, n ¼ 18). In the extra-large
PED group specifically, the 21 RPE tears occurred in 5 patients
(0.5 mg monthly), 5 patients (0.5 mg PRN), 5 patients (2.0 mg
monthly), and 6 patients (2.0 mg PRN; Fig 9).
Discussion
This HARBOR subanalysis is the largest prospective study
of neovascular AMD patients with PEDs treated with
intravitreal
ranibizumab
injection.
Over
24
months,
ranibizumab-treated patients with PED gained a mean visual
acuity of approximately 7 to 9 letters, and there was no
difference in mean BCVA gains when compared with pa-
tients who did not have PED at baseline. In all ranibizumab
treatment arms, PED height decreased regardless of PED
height at baseline. Although patients treated with ranibizu-
mab 2.0 mg had a slightly better anatomic response than
those treated with ranibizumab 0.5 mg (mean change from
baseline, �155.9 to �165.8 mm in the 0.5-mg group
and �191.1 to �201.6 mm in the 2.0-mg group), no addi-
tional visual acuity benefit was seen. Additionally, patients
who received a higher dose of ranibizumab (2.0 mg) also
had higher rates of PED resolution (57%e70% vs. 45%e
53% with 0.5 mg) but did not experience greater increases
from baseline in visual acuity at 24 months (approximately
7 vs. 8e9 letters with 0.5 mg). These data suggest that
complete resolution of the PED is not necessary for visual
acuity gains. In fact, patients with an extra-large PED who
received ranibizumab 2.0 mg monthly had a mean decrease
in vision at 24 months, although there was a lot of variability
in BCVA change from baseline at month 24 in these patients
(range, �62 to 30 letters).
Interestingly, in this analysis we found that patients with
PED at baseline had better vision at baseline (55.7 vs. 51.9
letters) and 24 months (64.4 vs. 62.0 letters) than patients
without PED at baseline. Typically, PEDs are considered to
be the most challenging AMD subtype to resolve anatomi-
cally. Yet, this and other analyses10,21 found that the visual
prognosis may indeed be better for these patients as long as
they do not experience RPE tears. Waldstein et al10 reported
that patients with PED at baseline had significantly better
vision than patients without PED at baseline (55 vs. 53
letters, respectively; P ¼ 0.005). At week 52, after anti-
VEGF therapy, patients with PED present still had better
vision than patients without PED present (65 vs. 60 letters,
respectively; P < 0.001). Rahimy et al21 reported that
patients with chronic multilayered fibrovascular PED have
been noted to have a favorable visual prognosis with
chronic anti-VEGF therapy.
In HARBOR, patients with PED at baseline experienced
visual acuity gains and reductions in PED height with PRN
therapy using the presence of PED as a criterion for re-
treatment. In patients with PED at baseline, gains in
BCVA at month 24 in patients treated with ranibizumab
PRN (7e8 letters) were similar to those in patients who
received monthly therapy (7e9 letters). Over 24 months,
patients with PED present at baseline required slightly more
injections (14.0 injections) than patients with PED absent at
baseline in the ranibizumab 0.5-mg PRN group (12.5 in-
jections), and patients in the ranibizumab 2.0-mg PRN
group required a similar number of injections regardless of
PED status at baseline (PED present, 11.6 injections; PED
absent, 10.7 injections). There was a trend toward more
injections being necessary in patients as PED height
increased. These data suggest that patients with PEDs,
especially larger PEDs, require close follow-up and more
treatments, but still do well with regard to vision and OCT
anatomic features with PRN therapy after 3 monthly loading
doses. It is important to note that although the presence of
PED was a re-treatment criterion in HARBOR, patients with
complete resolution of PED did not necessarily see an
additional vision benefit and were more likely to demon-
strate macular atrophy at month 24. These data suggest that
PRN treatment does not need to achieve complete resolution
of the PED.
Previous small retrospective trials report mixed results of
anti-VEGF therapy for PEDs. In a study of 125 consecutive
patients with vascularized PED and neovascular AMD,

 anti-VEGF therapy stabilized, but did not improve, vision.22
In 2 small investigations,23,24 anti-VEGF therapy was more
beneficial in patients with serous or avascular PED than
fibrovascular PED.23,24 In a prospective study of 32 patients
with vascularized PED and 29 patients with serous PED,
anti-VEGF therapy was effective in improving vision in
both arms of the trial.25 These smaller investigations22e25
prompted larger more definitive prospective studies, such
as this subanalysis of HARBOR.
Chan et al18 performed a prospective analysis similar to
the current HARBOR subanalysis, but with a smaller
number of patients (n ¼ 36) and shorter study duration
(12 months). Visual and anatomic outcomes of patients
with neovascular AMD and PED at baseline treated with
ranibizumab 0.5 mg (n ¼ 6) or 2.0 mg (n ¼ 12) monthly
for 12 months or treated with ranibizumab 0.5 mg (n ¼ 7)
or 2.0 mg (n ¼ 11) monthly for 4 months then PRN for 8
months were evaluated. In this study, 33.3%, 42.8%,
33.3%, and 18.2% of eyes had a gain of 15 letters or
more at month 12 in the 0.5-mg monthly, 0.5-mg PRN,
2.0-mg monthly, and 2.0-mg PRN groups, respectively.
Interestingly, the 0.5-mg PRN group showed the highest
percentage of patients to demonstrate a gain in vision, but no
statistically significant differences in visual or anatomic
outcomes at 12 months were identified between patients
treated with 0.5 mg or 2.0 mg ranibizumab. In an assessment
of early response at weeks 4 and 8, there were more sub-
stantial improvements in vision and reductions of subretinal

 fluid in patients who received 2.0 mg ranibizumab relative
to patients who received 0.5 mg ranibizumab. In this sub-
analysis of HARBOR, greater early decreases (months 1 and
2) in PED height were noted in the 2.0-mg groups than in
the 0.5-mg groups (notably 0.5 mg PRN), but visual acuity
gains remained similar among 0.5-mg and 2.0-mg groups
over the 24-month period, including months 1 and 2.
Another approved intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy for
treatment of neovascular AMD, aflibercept, has been studied
in patients with PED. In the VIEW (VEGF Trap-Eye:
Investigation of Efficacy and Safety in Wet AMD) studies,
patients with neovascular AMD were treated with afli-
bercept 2.0 mg every 4 weeks (n ¼ 613; 75.3% had PED at
baseline), aflibercept 2.0 mg every 8 weeks (n ¼ 607; 75.8%
had PED at baseline), or ranibizumab 0.5 mg every 4 weeks
(n ¼ 595; 73.3% had PED at baseline), although this study
was limited by the use of time-domain OCT.10 At 1 year,
complete resolution of PED occurred in 39.5% of patients
in the group receiving aflibercept 2.0 mg every 4 weeks,
34.1% of patients in the group receiving aflibercept 2.0

 mg every 8 weeks, and 28.1% of patients in the group
receiving ranibizumab 0.5 mg every 4 weeks.10 In this
HARBOR analysis, 42% to 71% of patients treated with
ranibizumab 0.5 mg or 2.0 mg had complete resolution of
PED at 1 year. In a multivariate model in VIEW, presence
of PED at baseline demonstrated a �1.88-letter impact on
change in BCVA at week 52 from baseline compared with
absence of PED in all treatment groups (aflibercept and
ranibizumab) combined.10 This is similar to what was seen
in the current analysis of HARBOR at 2 years in which
patients with PED at baseline had a �1.8-letter impact on
BCVA change from baseline compared with patients
without PED at baseline. In a further analysis of VIEW2, the
vision decline seen in eyes with PED at baseline was
increased by the occurrence of intraretinal cystoid edema
during the PRN period.9 In smaller retrospective studies of
patients with PED who were considered refractory to
ranibizumab or bevacizumab therapy and switched to
aflibercept therapy, aflibercept demonstrated reductions in
anatomic measurements, such as PED height, and either a
stabilization or decline in vision over the course of the
study,26e30 suggesting that although switching to afli-
bercept had an impact on anatomic features, there was either
no impact or a negative impact on vision outcomes.
In this exploratory analysis of HARBOR data, there was
an approximately 3-fold higher rate of macular atrophy
development in patients with complete flattening of PED
compared with patients with persistent PED at month 24
(44% vs. 17%), but no difference in rates of macular atrophy
at month 24 between patients with and without PED at
baseline (32% vs. 29%). These data further support the idea
that treatment to resolve PEDs completely may not be
necessary because more macular atrophy is seen when the
PED resolved completely. It is unclear from the data
whether macular atrophy preceded or followed PED reso-
lution, and further analysis is required to elucidate this as-
sociation. An association between PEDs and macular
atrophy was observed previously in the Inhibit VEGF in
Age-Related Choroidal Neovascularization study.31 In 12 of
18 eyes with PED at baseline that were treated with anti-
VEGF therapy and that showed macular atrophy at a
follow-up visit, the area of atrophy was localized to the site

 of PED.31 In a natural history study of patients with PED
and central serous chorioretinopathy, complete resolution
of PED was associated with atrophy development in 19 of
22 patients (86%).32 Additionally, in a study of the natural
history of drusenoid PEDs, a higher proportion of patients
with drusenoid PED demonstrated atrophy at 5 years than
patients without PED (18% vs. 7%; P < 0.001).33 These
data suggest that the pathophysiology and association
between PEDs and macular atrophy should be explored
further.
Among patients with PED and no RPE tear at baseline in
HARBOR, 28 patients experienced an RPE tear by month
24; this occurred more often in the largest PEDs, with no
association by treatment group. A previous small prospec-
tive analysis by Sarraf et al34 evaluated 37 eyes with
vascularized PED and neovascular AMD treated with
ranibizumab 0.5 mg or 2.0 mg either monthly or PRN for
12 months. Five eyes (14%) demonstrated an RPE tear.
Four of the 5 tears occurred in patients treated with
ranibizumab 2.0 mg. Additionally, an increased risk of
tear development was seen in patients with a PED height
more than 550 mm (4 of 13 patients [31%]). The rate of
RPE tears was lower in HARBOR, occurring in 5% of
patients with a PED at baseline; however, this rate
increased to 14% (a rate very similar to the overall RPE
tear rate in the study by Sarraf et al34) in the group with
larger
PEDs.
Unlike
the
previous
analysis,
which
identified more tears in patients treated with ranibizumab
2.0 mg, a similar number of tears were seen across
treatment groups. Similar to the previous analysis, most
tears occurred in patients with larger PEDs at baseline
(�352 mm; mean PED height in this group, 515.6 mm).
These
data
suggest
that
patients
with
larger
PEDs,
especially greater than 500 mm, receiving anti-VEGF
experience a higher rate of RPE tears compared with pa-
tients with smaller PEDs and confirms the results of previ-
ous smaller studies.34,35
There are a few limitations of this HARBOR subanalysis
study. This was an exploratory post hoc subgroup analysis
and the results should be interpreted with caution because
they may be the result of chance. The PED type (i.e., serous,
fibrovascular) at baseline was not assessed, and therefore the
effect of PED type on outcomes could not be evaluated at
this time. Only the height of the PED was measured in
HARBOR; 3-dimensional assessments of the PED volume
may give more information than height.36 Additionally,
height
categories
were
not
predetermined
and
were
defined by quartile assignment of the entire cohort with
PED. Although this allows for an approximately equal
comparison between PED height groups, it may not
demonstrate accurately the effect of ranibizumab on PEDs
of any specific height. In terms of the atrophy analysis,
this study lacked fundus autofluorescence imaging, which
is used routinely for evaluation of macular atrophy.
Despite these limitations, this subanalysis still provides
previously unavailable data on the efficacy of ranibizumab
therapy in approximately 600 patients with PEDs.
In conclusion, ranibizumab 0.5 mg given monthly or
PRN effectively managed PEDs in patients with neo-
vascular AMD, and significant vision gains of þ7.9 to þ9.0
letters were achieved regardless of PED height at baseline
in this analysis of 598 patients with PED. Similar vision
gains were observed with ranibizumab treatment regardless
of PED status at baseline; despite the perception that PEDs
are a more difficult anatomic subtype to treat, patients with
a PED started and completed the study with better average
vision than those without a PED. In this analysis, although

Pictures & Perspectives
Antimony Intraocular Foreign Body with an Intact Electroretinogram
A 65-year-old man with a history of trauma to the right eye 60 years previously presented with a metallic intraocular foreign body (Fig
1A, B). The object was removed via pars plana vitrectomy (Fig 1C, arrow) and found to be composed of antimony. A postoperative
maximum combined scotopic white 0-decibel electroretinogram demonstrated normal amplitude and implicit times, 209 mV and 52 ms,
respectively (Fig 1D). Antimony is well-tolerated within the eye with no indications of metallosis.
