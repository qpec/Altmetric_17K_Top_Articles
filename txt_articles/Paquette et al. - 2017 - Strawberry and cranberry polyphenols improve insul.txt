Abstract
Plant-derived foods rich in polyphenols are associated with several cardiometabolic health benefits, such as reduced postprandial
hyperglycaemia. However, their impact on whole-body insulin sensitivity using the hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp technique remains
under-studied. We aimed to determine the effects of strawberry and cranberry polyphenols (SCP) on insulin sensitivity, glucose tolerance,
insulin secretion, lipid profile, inflammation and oxidative stress markers in free-living insulin-resistant overweight or obese human subjects
(n 41) in a parallel, double-blind, controlled and randomised clinical trial. The experimental group consumed an SCP beverage (333 mg SCP)
daily for 6 weeks, whereas the Control group received a flavour-matched Control beverage that contained 0 mg SCP. At the beginning and at
the end of the experimental period, insulin sensitivity was assessed by a hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp, and glucose tolerance and
insulin secretion by a 2-h oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Insulin sensitivity increased in the SCP group as compared with the Control
group (+0·9 (SEM 0·5) × 10− 3 v. −0·5 (SEM 0·5) × 10−3 mg/kg per min per pmol, respectively, P = 0·03). Compared with the Control group, the SCP
group had a lower first-phase insulin secretion response as measured by C-peptide levels during the first 30 min of the OGTT (P = 0·002).
No differences were detected between the two groups for lipids and markers of inflammation and oxidative stress. A 6-week dietary
intervention with 333 mg of polyphenols from strawberries and cranberries improved insulin sensitivity in overweight and obese non-diabetic,
insulin-resistant human subjects but was not effective in improving other cardiometabolic risk factors.

According to the International Diabetes Federation(1), up to 592
million people worldwide (one in ten adults) will suffer from
type 2 diabetes by the year 2035. This alarming increase has
been predicted based on several factors, such as the high pre-
valence of obesity and sedentary lifestyles(2,3). Indeed in obese
humans, elevated levels of NEFA, pro-inflammatory cytokines
and other factors produced by adipose tissue are key determi-
nants of insulin resistance(4). To maintain plasma glucose at
normal levels, pancreatic β-cells must adjust their function to
compensate for insulin resistance. This leads to an exhaustion
of β-cell insulin secretion and the development of impaired
glucose tolerance (IGT) and subsequent type 2 diabetes.
In recent decades, scientific evidence has shown a link between
increased consumption of fruits and vegetables, particularly berries,
and reduced incidence of type 2 diabetes(5). Recent reviews have
indeed reported that berries, like strawberries and cranberries, can
lower markers of cardiometabolic risk(6–11) and improve markers of
the metabolic syndrome in humans(12–14). It is well-documented
that strawberries and cranberries are rich in polyphenols and
contain
a
wide
variety
of
phenolic
compounds,
ranging
from
phenolic acids (hydroxybenzoic
and hydroxycinnamic
acids), flavonoids (anthocyanins, flavonols and flavan-3-ols) to
polymerised molecules (proanthocyanidins and ellagitannins)(15).
According to several in vitro and animal studies, polyphenols may
improve glucose metabolism(16) and peripheral glucose uptake in
insulin-sensitive tissues by increasing GLUT4 translocation and
activity and reducing oxidative stress and inflammation(17,18). It has
recently been demonstrated that anthocyanin-rich bilberry

 extract reduces glycaemia and improves insulin sensitivity
in diabetic mice(19). Afrin et al.(12) reviewed six human inter-
vention studies on the impact of strawberries on the metabolic
syndrome, and specifically on the prevention of type 2 diabetes,
but none used the gold standard clamp technique to assess
insulin sensitivity.
There are several indices calculated from the oral glucose
tolerance test (OGTT), such as the Matsuda index and insulin
sensitivity
index
(ISI),
or
from
fasting
glycaemia
and/or
insulinaemia, such as the homeostasis model assessment of insulin
sensitivity (HOMA-IR) and the quantitative insulin sensitivity
check index (QUICKI), that indirectly estimate insulin sensitivity
in humans. However, these indices are not as accurate as a
direct measurement of whole-body insulin sensitivity by the
hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp(20). In this respect, the
clamp technique is recognised as the reference method for mea-
suring insulin sensitivity, and according to Antuna-Puente et al.(21),
it should be promoted in clinical human studies. So far, only two
studies have used a hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp to
assess the effect of berry polyphenols on insulin sensitivity(22,23).
According to one study in which obese non-diabetic insulin-
resistant participants received a blueberry or placebo smoothie
twice a day, the mean percentage increase in insulin sensitivity
was five times greater in the experimental group compared with
that in the placebo group(22). In the second study, a grape poly-
phenol supplement protected against a decrease in insulin sensi-
tivity caused by a fructose-rich diet in overweight subjects(23). To
the best of our knowledge, there are no human studies evaluating
the effects of strawberry and cranberry polyphenols (SCP) on
insulin sensitivity assessed by the hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic
clamp in non-diabetic insulin-resistant subjects.
The proposed study aims to test the effects of an SCP blend
incorporated in a beverage on insulin sensitivity and related
parameters in free-living overweight or obese men and women
with insulin resistance. This blend has been comprehensively
analysed and contains well-defined amounts of anthocyanins,
proanthocyanidins, ellagitannins, phenolic acids and flavonols
(quercetins)(24). The primary endpoint was the difference in the
change in insulin sensitivity after 6 weeks of SCP consumption
compared with a SCP-free Control beverage. Secondary endpoints
aimed to assess changes in glucose tolerance, insulin secretion,
plasma lipids, markers of oxidative stress and inflammation, as well
as to characterise plasma phenolic components as bioavailability
(efficacy) outcomes. We hypothesised that the consumption of SCP
improves insulin sensitivity and lipid profile and reduces inflam-
matory and oxidative stress markers in overweight/obese subjects.
Methods
Study design
This 6-week clinical trial was a randomised, double-blinded,
controlled, parallel study performed at the Institute of Nutrition
and Functional Foods (INAF) in Quebec City , Canada. The
study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of
Helsinki and all procedures involving human subjects were
approved by the Research Ethical Committee of the Quebec
University
Health
Center.
Written
informed
consent
was
obtained from all participants after reading a detailed consent
form prior to their participation in the study. This trial was
registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01766570. The study was
conducted, including analyses, between spring 2012 and
fall 2015.
Subjects
All subjects were overweight or obese (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2) and
insulin resistant based on fasting plasma insulin level >60 pmol/l
(J.-P. Després and J. Bergeron, unpublished results). Subjects
may have also displayed impaired fasting plasma glucose (IFG)
(5·6–6·9 mmol/l)
with
or
without
IGT
(7·8–11·0 mmol/l)
following a 2-h 75 g OGTT(25). Exclusion criteria included
smoking, chronic disease (diabetes, respiratory, renal, gastro-
intestinal or hepatic disease, CVD, hypertension, cancer),
metabolic or acute disease, use of medication or supplement
known to affect lipid or glucose metabolism, use of antioxidant
supplements, major surgery in the 3 months preceding the
study and significant weight change (SEM 10 %) within 6 months
prior to beginning the study.
A total of 116 subjects, recruited in the Quebec City metro-
politan area by media advertising, were first screened to
examine their eligibility to participate in this study. Of the fifty
eligible subjects who began the experimental period, forty-six
participants (twenty men and twenty-six women) aged between
40 and 70 years completed the study. However, five subjects
(three in the SCP group and two in the Control group) were
excluded from analysis because they no longer met some
inclusion criteria, leading to a total of eighteen men (nine in
each of the two groups) and twenty-three postmenopausal
women (eleven in the SCP group and twelve in the Control
group) who were included in the statistical analysis (online
Supplementary Fig. S1).
Experimental groups
The polyphenol blend and Control were provided as energy-free
beverages formulated with purified water and small amounts of
sucralose. Red food colour was added in the Control beverage.
Both beverages thus had the same taste and visual aspect. Both
were formulated in a single batch by Atrium Innovations Inc. and
were provided in dark bottles at 120ml/d. The bottles were sealed
and kept at room temperature with limited light exposure.
The polyphenol blend contained 1·84g of a mixture of dry straw-
berry (Fragaria×ananassa Duch) and cranberry (Vaccinium
macrocarpon L.) polyphenol extracts (GlucoPhenolTM; Nutra-
Canada) providing an average daily dose of 333 (SD 12)mg of
polyphenols (18 % total polyphenols in GlucoPhenolTM, as deter-
mined by Folin–Ciocalteu assay). SCP (GlucoPhenolTM) complies
with good manufacturing practices according to Health Canada
regulations. To determine the amount of polyphenols to be used
for the present study, we first conducted a bioavailability study in
rats with different doses of SCP(24). The dose of 333 mg poly-
phenols was chosen as corresponding, for a 60kg human, to the
dose (36mg/kg) that induced the highest concentration of plasma
total phenolic metabolites in the rat(24). The total phenolic content
was monitored in the SCP beverage throughout the study,
ensuring a minimum of 300 mg/d. In order to simulate the taste

 and colour of the SCP-containing beverage, a pomegranate-
derived red food colour was used in the SCP-free Control
beverage providing a small quantity of polyphenols. The two
beverages were characterised for their phenolic composition as
previously described(24) (Table 1). In brief, proanthocyanidins
were
analysed
by
normal-phase
HPLC
with
fluorescence
detection, and quantified using an epicatechin standard. Phenolic
acids were analysed using reverse-phase ultra-high performance
liquid chromatography (UHPLC) coupled with tandem MS and
their quantification was achieved using their corresponding
standard when available, or their aglycone or most similar
phenolic structure otherwise. The daily phenolic dose provided by
SCP corresponds approximately to the intake of 112g of fresh fruit
(equivalent to two servings).
Study timeline
Participants were equally divided into two groups by sex after a
2-week run-in period. During this period, subjects were asked
to maintain their usual food habits and physical activity level,
and were limited to one unit drink or less of beer or spirits
per day. The consumption of berries, wine, polyphenol sup-
plements and all products containing berries or wine was also
forbidden. Assignment of treatment was conducted through the
use of a random sequence of numbers. Allocation to treatment
was concealed by a secure computer-assisted method enabling
preservation of assignments until enrolment was assured and
confirmed. Men and women were equally distributed among
the two groups using the same computer-assisted method. The
study sponsor held the trial codes which were disclosed after
completion of the statistical analyses. Participants in the treat-
ment group consumed an SCP-containing beverage, whereas
the Control group received a flavour-matched SCP-free Control
beverage, daily for a 6-week period. During the experimental
period, subjects were asked to follow the same aforementioned
recommendations as during the run-in period. Approximately
2–3 weeks after the beginning of the experimental period,
a registered dietitian called all participants once to ensure that
they consumed the beverages daily and followed the prescribed
instructions. Subjects were instructed to shake the bottle before
consumption and drink the beverage with or without food
regardless of the time of day. To document compliance, sub-
jects were requested to bring back the unused bottles at the end
of the study. Bottle counts indicated a 99 % compliance in both
groups. Also, a 6-week checklist was provided to all participants
to identify study materials that had not been ingested, thus
providing us with a tool to confirm the compliance rate of the
participants.
Anthropometric and blood pressure measurements
Fasted body weight, height, waist and hip circumferences
were measured at the beginning and at the end of the study
using standardised methods. BMI and waist:hip ratio were
then calculated. Blood pressure was measured three times
on the right arm with an automatic tensiometer (Digital
Blood
Pressure
Monitor,
model
HEM-907XL;
OMRON®)
following a 10-min rest at the beginning and at the end of the
experimental period.
Food records and questionnaires
During the screening visit, two online self-administered ques-
tionnaires were completed by all subjects to collect information
on medical history, lifestyle, economic and socio-demographic
characteristics. Participants were also asked to complete two
online self-administered questionnaires at the beginning and at
the end of the experimental period, including a validated FFQ
to record energy and macronutrient intake for 28 consecutive
days(26) and a short physical activity questionnaire. There was
also an additional questionnaire on the subjects’ liking of the
experimental beverages (taste, texture, etc.) and on side effects,
administered at the end of the study. Changes in medication,

Hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp
A 120-min hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp was per-
formed at the beginning and at the end of the experimental
period at the Diabetes Research Unit of the Laval University
Health Center of Quebec after a 12-h overnight fast, according
to the method described by Piche et al.(27). Alcohol intake was
forbidden 48 h before the clamp. Insulin sensitivity (M/I) was
calculated from glucose infusion rate (mg/min) during the final
30 min of the clamp divided by body weight (kg) and then
divided by the mean insulin concentration during the final
30 min of the clamp (mg/kg per min per pmol)(27). For NEFA
analysis, additional blood samples were collected during the
clamp at 0, 30, 60, 90 and 120 min, centrifuged after 30 min at
room temperature and then stored at −80°C until analysis.
Oral glucose tolerance test
A 75-g OGTT was performed 2–3 d before each clamp at the
beginning and at the end of the experimental period at INAF to
assess glucose tolerance after a 12-h overnight fast. Blood
samples were collected at time points −15, 0, 15, 30, 60 and
120 min, immediately centrifuged and kept at −20°C for further
measurements of glucose, insulin and C-peptide. Alcohol intake
was forbidden 48 h before the test. For the second clamp and
OGTT, participants were asked to consume the beverage
12 h before their appointment.
Blood collection and storage
Plasma and serum samples were collected in the fasting state,
before each OGTT and clamp, and stored at −80°C for further
analysis

Glucose, insulin and C-peptide
Plasma glucose was determined using an enzymatic method(28)
and plasma insulin was measured by RIA with polyethylene
glycol separation(29). Plasma C-peptide level, an indicator of
insulin secretion used to estimate pancreatic β-cell function,
was determined using a modified version of the method of
Hedging with polyclonal antibody A-4741 from Ventrex and
polyethylene glycol precipitation(29).
Lipids
LDL and HDL were isolated from fresh blood by ultra-
centrifugation combined with a heparin–manganese chloride
precipitation(30). Then, cholesterol and TAG concentrations in
total serum and lipoproteins were determined enzymatically
by using a Technicon RA-500 analyzer (Bayer). NEFA were
determined in serum via an enzymatic colorimetric assay
(Wako Diagnostics) using a Beckman Olympus AU400 (Beck-
man Coulter Canada LP).
Inflammatory, thrombogenic and oxidative markers
Serum level of hsCRP was measured using nephelometry as
described previously(31). PAI-1, IL-6 and TNF-α were measured
in plasma at the Quebec Heart and Lung Institute, Quebec,
using commercially available Multiplex kits (EMD Millipore).
Plates were read and analysed using the Bio-Plex 200 system
(Bio-Rad). Oxidised-LDL, HMW adiponectin and RANTES were
determined using a commercially available ELISA (Mercodia;
R&D Systems) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Total
antioxidant capacity of plasma, assessed by FRAP assay, was
determined as described previously(32).
Bioavailability study
A subgroup of seventeen subjects performed an additional
bioavailability study, to identify circulating phenolic metabolites
following the administration of experimental beverages. Halfway
through the supplementation period (30 (SEM 3)d), fasted subjects
were administered their respective treatment at INAF (SCP,
n 8; Control, n 9). Blood samples were collected using EDTA-
containing syringes before and 30, 60, 120, 240 and 360 min after
the ingestion. During the experiment, all subjects were kept fasted.
Plasma samples were obtained by centrifugation (3500 rpm,
10 min at 4°C). Plasma phenolic compounds were characterised
by
UHPLC–MS/MS
as
previously
described(24),
with
slight
modifications. Acidified plasma samples (300 µl) were loaded into
preconditioned Waters OASIS HLB (Waters Ltd) µElution plates
2 mg–30 µm. The retained phenolic compounds were eluted with
75 µl of acetone–ultrapure water–acetic acid solution (70:29·5:0·5,
v/v/v) in presence of rosmarinic acid as internal standard (1µg/ml
final concentration). The eluted solutions were directly analysed
by UHPLC–MS/MS, using a Waters Xevo TQD MS (Waters Ltd)
coupled to a Waters Acquity UHPLC (Waters Ltd). Phenolic
metabolites
were
separated
and
identified
as
previously
reported(24).
Statistical analyses
We estimated sample size based on the primary endpoint of
insulin sensitivity from data published by Stull et al.(22) and
Ouellet et al.(33). For this purpose, we used the following
values: an average difference in changes from baseline (Post v.
Pre) of 17 × 10−3 mg/kg per min per pmol for insulin sensitivity
between the SCP and Control groups after 6 weeks and an
estimated SD of 18. Power calculation at 80 % with a two-sided
significance level set at 0·05 showed that a minimum of forty
subjects, twenty in each group, was required to observe sig-
nificant changes from baseline in insulin sensitivity between the
SCP and Control groups over a 6-week dietary intervention,
taking into account 25 % expected dropouts. Statistical analyses
were performed using SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute).
Paired t tests were performed to compare changes from
baseline (Post v. Pre) within the same group. Because baseline

 insulin sensitivity was correlated with M/I (rs = 0·50; n 39;
P < 0·001) only, PROC MIXED for ANCOVA with baseline
insulin sensitivity as covariate was used to compare the changes
in M/I between the two treatments. A two-way repeated-
measures ANOVA was applied for variables with repeated
measures over time (glucose, insulin, C-peptide and NEFA
concentrations during the OGTT or clamp). In this model,
no significant time-by-treatment interaction was observed.
Furthermore, positive incremental AUC (IAUC) for glucose
(mmol/l per min), insulin (pmol/l per min) and C-peptide
(pmol/l per min) up to 30 and 120 min were calculated using
the trapezoid method with baseline value corresponding to the
fasting level (time point −15 min of the OGTT). The percentage
change in IAUC ((IAUC post value − IAUC pre value) × 100/
IAUC pre value) was also calculated. PROC MIXED for a
two-way ANOVA was used to compare changes from baseline
for anthropometric and blood pressure measurements, IAUC
glucose, insulin and C-peptide during OGTT, lipid and cardio-
vascular parameters and markers of inflammation and oxidative
stress. Data from men and women were pooled together
because there was no significant sex-by-treatment interaction.
As several significant correlations were observed within and
between OGTT and lipid variables, a Bonferroni correction was
applied, setting the two-sided significance level at P < 0·004
for those variables. No Bonferroni correction was applied for
M/I, inflammatory and oxidative stress because no correlation
was observed between those and the other variables, and a
two-sided significance level was set at 0·05. PROC GLM ANOVA
was used to compare the FFQ variables.
Plasma concentrations of phenolic metabolites were mea-
sured post-ingestion in a subgroup (n 17) and were compared
using the Welch’s t test (correcting for unequal variance) when
data were assumed to be normally distributed (or met the
criteria for normality after log transformation), or using the
non-parametric Mann–Whitney test otherwise, using GraphPad
Prism 6.05 software. Correlations were assessed between
circulating concentrations of phenolic metabolites (expressed
as area under the plasma concentration (nM) time (min) curve
between 0 and 30 min after the ingestion of the beverages) and
changes in M/I and in outcomes of OGTT (expressed as the
percentage change in the IAUC for glucose, insulin and
C-peptide during the first 30 min of the OGTT). A robust
regression with M-estimations was adjusted using the procedure
ROBUSTREG of SAS 9.4. To perform an optimal selection of the
model, the smallest Akaike criterion was deemed the best
model. Considering the small size of the subgroup and the
multiplicity of analysis, a Bonferroni correction (P < 0·0025) was
performed for post-ingestion plasma concentration of phenolic
metabolites. Bonferroni correction was also applied for the
correlational analysis with the outcomes of the first 30 min
OGTT parameters (P < 0·017). Since M/I assesses insulin sensi-
tivity by hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp, correlations
with M/I changes were analysed separately from the OGTT
rate changes and remained at a statistically significant level
of P ≤ 0·05. The results are presented as means with their
standard errors.

 regarding age, body weight, BMI, waist and hip circumferences,
lipid profile, fasting plasma glucose, 2-h plasma glucose or
fasting plasma insulin.
At baseline, all subjects had a high fasting plasma insulin level
(>60 pmol/l), of whom thirty-one had fasting plasma insulin
levels
>90 pmol/l.
From
data
collected
during
the
pre-
intervention OGTT and according to the Expert Committee on
the Diagnosis and Classification of Diabetes Mellitus(25), twelve
subjects
had
both
IFG
(5·6–6·9 mmol/l)
and
IGT
(7·8–
11·0 mmol/l), seventeen subjects had IFG only, three subjects
had IGT only and nine among them had normal glucose
tolerance (fasting plasma glucose <5·6 mmol/l and plasma
glucose <7·8 mmol/l after 120 min).
Food intake and physical activity
According to FFQ data (online Supplementary Table S1), there
were no differences in baseline dietary intake or in changes
from baseline (Post v. Pre) in energy and macronutrient intake
between the two groups. In addition, no change from the level
of physical activity was perceived during the study (data not
shown). As for side effects, no major harmful or unexpected
effects were reported in either group.
Anthropometric measurements and blood pressure
Body weight, anthropometric, systolic and diastolic blood
pressure measurements were performed at the beginning and at
the end of the experimental period. No differences in changes
from baseline (Post v. Pre) were observed for these parameters
between the two groups (online Supplementary Table S2).
Insulin sensitivity and other parameters of
glucose homoeostasis
Insulin sensitivity (M/I) increased by 14% (+0·9 (SEM 0·5)×10−3mg/
kg per min per pmol) (Fig. 1) in the SCP group (P=0·05), whereas
it decreased by 7% (−0·5 (SEM 0·5)×10−3mg/kg per min per pmol)
in the Control group without achieving a level of significance
(P=0·28). When we compared the changes from baseline
(Post v. Pre) between the two treatments, the SCP group showed
significant improvement in insulin sensitivity (P=0·03) compared
with Control.
We also performed repeated measurements ANOVA for
glucose (Table 3), insulin (Table 3) and C-peptide (Fig. 2(a)
and (b)) up to 120 min during OGTT and for NEFA (online
Supplementary Fig. S2) over time during the clamp. There were
no differences between baseline values (Pre) for all glucose
metabolism parameters. Whereas glucose, insulin and NEFA
responses were not different between treatments, there was an
overall increase in C-peptide with Control compared with SCP
(P = 0·002) (Fig. 2(c)).
The mean IAUC up to 30 min corresponding to the early
phase of insulin response during the OGTT and the mean IAUC
up to 120 min after the OGTT are shown in Table 3 for plasma
glucose and insulin and in Fig. 3 and 4 for C-peptide. No dif-
ferences in changes from baseline (Post v. Pre) for plasma IAUC
glucose (Table 3), IAUC insulin (Table 3) and IAUC C-peptide
(Fig. 3) were observed up to 120 min within each group or
between the two groups. However, compared with the baseline
(Pre) values, plasma IAUC C-peptide up to 30 min was increased
by 26 % in the Control group (P= 0·003) and non-significantly
reduced by 8 % in the SCP group (P= 0·21). These changes were
different between the two groups (P = 0·002) (Fig. 4).
Lipid profile
No differences in changes from baseline (Post v. Pre) for total,
LDL- and HDL-cholesterol or TAG were observed within each
group or between the two groups (Table 4).
Inflammatory, thrombogenic and oxidative markers
The effects of SCP on inflammatory and oxidative stress markers
are shown in Table 4. No differences in changes from baseline
(Post v. Pre) for pro-inflammatory cytokines, hsCRP, HMW
adiponectin, PAI-1, oxidised-LDL, RANTES or total antioxidant
capacity of plasma (FRAP) were observed within each group or
between the two groups.
Phenolic composition and bioavailability of
experimental beverages
As shown in Table 1, SCP-containing and SCP-free Control
beverages differed significantly in terms of phenolic content.
SCP contained four times more proanthocyanidins and six times
more phenolic acids. In particular, SCP were characterised
by a very high content of coumaric acids: p-coumaric acid,
m-coumaric acid and coumaroyl glucoside. At the 30-d mid-
point of the daily consumption of the beverages, about twenty
phenolic metabolites were identified in the plasma of volun-
teers. They are present in circulation as conjugate metabolites
and
microbial
degradation
products,
because
the
native
phenolic compounds are normally extensively metabolised.

 Among these, p-coumaric acid, m-coumaric acid, ferulic acid
and
hydroxyhippuric
acid,
whose
absorption
kinetics
is
presented in Fig. 5, were detected in significantly higher con-
centration following the consumption of SCP, relative to Control
(respective AUC of 17·4 (SEM 1·8) v. 0, 85·9 (SEM 5·3) v. 0·7 (SEM
0·3), 20·3 (SEM 3·9) v. 0·9 (SEM 0·4), 204·6 (SEM 25·4) v. 38·6 (SEM
6·9); P < 0·0001). A significant negative correlation was found
between plasma concentration of p-coumaric acid (AUC 0–
30 min) and the percentage change in IAUC (before and after
treatment) of the above-mentioned C-peptide response (first
30 min of the OGTT) (P = 0·0046, r2 0·34). No correlations were
reported between the remaining metabolites and the para-
meters related to insulin sensitivity and the first 30 min OGTT.
Discussion
This study investigated the impact of daily consumption of a
333 mg SCP blend on insulin sensitivity in insulin-resistant, non-
diabetic subjects over a period of 6 weeks. The main outcomes
of this study are: (1) an improvement in insulin sensitivity, as
assessed by hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp and (2) the
prevention of further compensatory insulin secretion, as shown
Table 3. Incremental AUC (IAUC) and time point values over time during oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) for glucose and insulin before and after 6-week
consumption of strawberry and cranberry polyphenols (SCP) or Control in insulin-resistant human subjects

Polyphenols and insulin sensitivity

Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core. IP address: 77.173.35.219, on 04 Jun 2019 at 18:01:51, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use, available at https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0007114517000393
 by a lack of increase in the early C-peptide response during
an OGTT. Analysis of plasma phenolic metabolites also
revealed that the most abundant phenolic acids identified with
SCP intake were p-coumaric acid, m-coumaric acid, ferulic acid
and hydroxyhippuric acid. Interestingly, plasma p-coumaric
acid was inversely related to the early C-peptide response
during OGTT.
The hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp is the gold standard
and reference technique for assessing insulin sensitivity when
whole-body insulin sensitivity is the primary outcome(20). It is a
steady-state technique that requires a constant insulin infusion. It
is the most reliable technique in a clinical study like ours with
relatively low number of subjects. Although indirect OGTT-
derived indices (e.g. Matsuda index and ISI) may be of particular
interest in prospective studies with large cohorts, they have
potential limitations in reproducibility due to intra-individual
variation in plasma glucose and insulin responses during the
OGTT(34). With regard to the indirect indices based on fasting
levels of glucose and insulin (e.g. HOMA-IR and QUICKI), they
tend to assess hepatic insulin resistance rather than peripheral and
whole-body insulin sensitivity(35).
Our study demonstrates an improvement in insulin sensitivity
following the consumption of SCP compared with Control.
These results are in good agreement with those of Stull et al.(22)
who observed a 22 % increase in insulin sensitivity, assessed
with the hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp technique, fol-
lowing a 6-week daily dietary supplementation with whole
blueberries in obese, non-diabetic, and insulin-resistant human
subjects, and those of Hokayem et al.(23) who noted that the
negative effects of fructose used to develop insulin resistance
were counteracted by grape polyphenol supplementation in a
double-blind controlled trial. It is noteworthy that our dose of
polyphenols (a total of 333 mg of combined SCP/d), which is a
much lower dose than those used by Stull et al.(22) (1462 mg
polyphenols from blueberry powder/d) and Hokayem et al.(23)
(2 g from grape polyphenols/d), can exert a comparable effect
on insulin sensitivity. The present results with SCP are also in
good agreement with those reported by Edirisinghe et al.(36)
who observed a reduction in postprandial insulin response in
overweight adults after a single consumption of a high-
carbohydrate, moderate-fat meal with a strawberry beverage
containing 10 g of strawberries in a freeze-dried form (95 mg of
polyphenols). Furthermore, Park et al.(37) observed a reduction
in systolic and diastolic blood pressure concomitant with a
trend to improve fasting insulin and insulin sensitivity in sub-
jects with pre-hypertension consuming a grape seed extract-
containing beverage (528 mg of polyphenols). Most of these
subjects were hyperinsulinaemic or insulin resistant. This is of
interest in the present study, given the evidence supporting a
link between hypertension and insulin resistance through
insulin mediated signalling pathways(38) and NO production(39).
Similarly, Rodriguez-Mateos et al.(40) reported that endothelial
function (at 1 h) in healthy men increased in a dose-dependent
manner up to an intake of 766 mg polyphenols from a blueberry
drink and reached a plateau at higher doses. Therefore, the
present results together with those from the three latter studies
suggest that polyphenol doses lower than 800 mg may offer
metabolic benefits. Of note, the beneficial effect of SCP on
insulin sensitivity observed in the present study cannot be
explained by variations in energy and macronutrient intake,
body weight or body fat mass since no changes in these
parameters were seen between the two groups.
The progression from normal glucose tolerance to type 2
diabetes is characterised by both an increase in insulin resis-
tance and a decrease in insulin secretion caused by β-cell
dysfunction. Insulin resistance is defined as decreased tissue
sensitivity to insulin to stimulate glucose uptake and utilisation.

 In the early stages of insulin resistance, plasma glucose is
maintained at normal levels by a compensatory increase in
insulin secretion, the first abnormality being an increase in first-
phase insulin secretion by pancreatic β-cells(41). But when β-cell
compensation fails, fasting plasma glucose levels rise (IFG),
leading to IGT and eventually type 2 diabetes(42). In the context
of the present study, the beverage rich in polyphenols pre-
vented a further elevation in early-phase insulin release, as
indicated by C-peptide levels, and prevented the overall
increase of insulin secretion, suggesting that the improvement
in insulin sensitivity after consumption of the SCP beverage may
have precluded a further compensatory increase in insulin
secretion. A reducing effect of a polyphenol-rich cranberry
extract has already been observed on C-peptide levels in high-
fat/high-sucrose-fed mice(43). However, in humans, to the best
of our knowledge, this is the first report showing a beneficial
effect of a SCP extract on C-peptide response during an OGTT.
In this study, we found differences between the SCP and the
Control groups in the plasma levels of four polyphenolic
compounds and metabolites (p-coumaric acid, m-coumaric
acid, ferulic acid, hydroxyhippuric acid). These levels were
found in the same low micromolar range as that reported by
Feliciano et al.(44) and Park et al.(37), where physiological and
metabolic bioactivity is probable(45). Particularly of interest, an
increased plasma concentration of p-coumaric acid during the
30 min post-consumption was found to significantly correlate
with a reduced secretion of C-peptide compared with the
Control during the
early
phase of
the
OGTT response
(P = 0·0046, r2 0·34). Although a direct effect of p-coumaric acid
on insulin sensitivity cannot be confirmed by these results, this
compound was recently found to stimulate AMP-activated
protein kinase phosphorylation, leading to increased glucose
uptake in L6 myocytes(46). p-Coumaric acid was also found to
improve glucose uptake in vitro through synergistic interactions
with a commercial oral hypoglycaemic drug (thiazolidine-
dione)(47). Moreover, since only 5–10 % of ingested phenolic
compounds are assumed to be absorbed(48), a large amount
proceeds to the large intestine (especially polymeric forms such
as proanthocyanidins) where they can exert an activity. Indeed,
we recently showed that cranberry polyphenols can improve
insulin sensitivity in high-fat-fed mice, leading to reduced
inflammation in both intestinal and hepatic tissues, through
modulation of gut microbiota(43). In this latter study, changes in
gut microbiota were detected following 5 weeks of supple-
mentation, suggesting that 6 weeks of supplementation in
humans was very likely a period long enough to modulate their
intestinal microbiota. SCP may also improve insulin sensitivity
by increasing insulin signalling and glucose transport in skeletal
muscle cells. Indeed, Nizamutdinova et al.(17) showed that
anthocyanins administrated by gavage can improve insulin
signalling by stimulating tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin
receptors and by increasing the expression of GLUT4 in muscle
of streptozotocin-diabetic rats.
Whereas our study provides evidence for the beneficial effect
of SCP treatment on insulin sensitivity, this finding was not
associated with a decrease in other markers of cardiovascular
risk. Nutritional studies are somewhat contradictory regarding
the effects of strawberries and cranberries on cardiometabolic
markers such as plasma lipids, oxidative stress, antioxidant
capacity and inflammation. Indeed, lipid changes seen in our
study contrast with those reported by Basu et al.(7) and Lee
et al.(49) who observed a decrease in total cholesterol and LDL-
cholesterol in human subjects consuming either freeze-dried
strawberry powder(8) or cranberry extract(49). Similarly, our
findings on inflammatory and oxidative markers do not agree
with those of Moazen et al.(50) who observed a decrease in
plasma CRP and oxidised-LDL after administration of freeze-
dried strawberries, and those of Ruel et al.(9,11,51) who observed
an increase of plasma HDL-cholesterol, antioxidant capacity
and a decrease in oxidised-LDL after consumption of low-
energy cranberry drink. Additionally, some clinical studies
investigating the effects of approximately 300 mg polyphenols
from freeze-dried strawberry powder reported reducing effects
on fasting oxidised LDL for 6 weeks(9), and postprandial CRP
and IL-6(36) in an overweight, hyperlipidaemic population.
However, other clinical studies using freeze-dried strawberry
powder or reduced-energy cranberry juice have demonstrated,
as in our study, a lack of effect on antioxidant status(52), on CRP,
IL-6 and TNF-α(52,53).
Discrepancies between our results on lipids and inflamma-
tory and oxidative markers and those of the above-cited
studies(8,12,36,49–51) may stem from the delivery form of straw-
berry (freeze-dried form v. SCP extract) or cranberry (juice,
dried fruit forms or SCP extract), the experimental design (acute
v. longer term), the polyphenol dose or the population studied.
In the present study, the SCP were a SCP enriched extract
providing 333 mg/d of polyphenols and was devoid of fibres,
sugars, minerals and vitamins. On the one hand, this amount of
polyphenols, which corresponds to the quantity supplied by
about 120 g of fresh fruits, is equivalent to approximately one-
fourth the level of polyphenols present in the freeze-dried
strawberry powder used by Basu et al.(7) and Moazen et al.(50)
(1001–2006 mg
polyphenols/d)
and
in
the
low-energy
cranberry juice used in previous studies(9–12,15,51). On the
other hand, the key difference between the SCP extract used in
the present study and these other sources of polyphenols is the
lack of fermentable fibres. It is well recognised that strawber-
ries(54) and cranberries(55) contain significant amounts of fer-
mentable soluble and insoluble fibres that may reduce lipids,
inflammatory and oxidative markers(56). Therefore, the lack of
dietary fibre in our extract is among the plausible explanations
for the absence of an SCP effect on lipids, inflammatory and
oxidative markers in the current study. Moreover, the present
results and those from a study by Hokayem et al.(23) who used a
berry (grape) polyphenol extract, suggest that the various
phenol compounds present in berries may specifically improve
insulin sensitivity in humans.
The participants in this study were insulin resistant and
included
both
sexes
and
a
relatively
broad
age
range
(40–70 years). Given the free-living nature of the study, the
results can most likely apply to an overweight adult pre-diabetic
population. Despite the parallel arm design and polyphenol
content of the beverage used, the present study did allow
sufficient power to detect statistical differences on the primary
endpoint of insulin sensitivity. However, this study was not
sufficiently
powered
to
detect
differences
on
secondary

 endpoints, in particular hsCRP, TNF-α and oxidised-LDL. Yet, it
would have been interesting to obtain muscle and adipose tis-
sue biopsies to test whether SCP reduced inflammation in these
tissues. Such biopsies may have also allowed us to ascertain the
identity of the molecules involved in cellular insulin signalling.
Nonetheless, considering the robust nature of our randomised,
controlled, double-blind study, it is likely that the consumption
of SCP resulted in the improvement in the hyperinsulinaemic-
euglycaemic clamp insulin sensitivity and OGTT parameters.
Finally, since this is a proof-of-concept study, it will be necessary
to consider longer-term interventions in larger populations of
subjects to confirm the results and expand upon the potential role
of SCP in preventing or delaying the onset of type 2 diabetes.
In conclusion, our data indicate that 6-week consumption of
333 mg polyphenols from strawberries and cranberries may
improve insulin sensitivity and prevent an increase in com-
pensatory insulin secretion without affecting plasma lipids, CRP,
pro-inflammatory cytokines and antioxidant capacity. Con-
trolled dose–response trials are needed to ascertain the lower
and upper range of activity of these polyphenols, as well as
larger and longer-term studies.
