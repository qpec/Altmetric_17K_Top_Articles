Current treatment of anemia in chronic kidney disease
(CKD) with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents can lead to
substantial hemoglobin oscillations above target range and
high levels of circulating erythropoietin. Vadadustat (AKB-
6548), a novel, titratable, oral hypoxia-inducible factor
prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor induces endogenous
erythropoietin synthesis and enhances iron mobilization. In
this 20-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-
controlled, phase 2b study, we evaluated the efficacy and
safety of once-daily vadadustat in patients with stages 3a
to 5 non-dialysis-dependent CKD. The primary endpoint
was the percentage of patients who, during the last 2
weeks of treatment, achieved or maintained either a mean
hemoglobin level of 11.0 g/dl or more or a mean increase in
hemoglobin of 1.2 g/dl or more over the predose average.
Significantly, the primary endpoint was met in 54.9% of
patients on vadadustat and 10.3% of patients on placebo.
Significant increases in both reticulocytes and total iron-
binding capacity and significant decreases in both serum
hepcidin and ferritin levels were observed in patients on
vadadustat compared with placebo. The overall incidence
of adverse events was comparable between the 2 groups.
Serious adverse events occurred in 23.9% and 15.3% of the
vadadustat- and placebo-treated patients, respectively.
Three deaths occurred in the vadadustat arm. Thus, this
phase 2b study demonstrated that vadadustat raised and
maintained hemoglobin levels in a predictable and
controlled manner while enhancing iron mobilization in
patients with nondialysis-dependent CKD.

A
nemia is a common complication of chronic kidney
disease (CKD), driven predominantly by a relative
deficiency in renal erythropoietin (EPO) production,
concomitant functional and/or absolute iron deficiency, and
resistance to EPO signaling.1,2 As the severity of kidney dis-
ease progresses, anemia increases in prevalence and affects
nearly all patients with advanced-stage CKD.3 The presence of
anemia in patients with CKD is associated with increased risk
for hospitalization, cognitive impairment, reduced quality of
life, and major cardiovascular (CV) events, such as myocar-
dial infarction and stroke; furthermore, the severity of anemia
is also an independent predictor of mortality.4–7 The admin-
istration of injectable preparations of recombinant EPO
coupled with oral or i.v. iron supplementation are the current
mainstay of treatment for anemia in CKD.8,9 Though gener-
ally very effective therapeutically, the use of erythropoiesis-
stimulating
agents
(ESAs)
has
raised
significant
safety
concerns. ESA administration often results in substantial he-
moglobin (Hb) oscillations and excursions above target range,
which are associated with increased CV risk.9–12 Furthermore,
patients who require very high ESA doses to reach target Hb,
or who fail to reach target Hb levels at ESA doses that are nor-
mally effective, have increased mortality and hospitalization
rates.13–18 Meanwhile, i.v. iron supplementation may place
patients at increased risk of allergic reactions, infections,
and CV events.19,20 Therefore, a novel approach to anemia
therapy that is effective without generating supraphysiologic
plasma EPO levels and that reduces the need for iron supple-
mentation is highly desirable.
The pharmacologic targeting of the molecular machinery
that regulates the hypoxic induction of erythropoiesis has the
potential to solve some of the clinical dilemmas associated
with conventional ESA therapy. EPO synthesis in the kidney
and liver is regulated by hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-2, an
oxygen-sensitive heterodimeric transcription
factor
that,
together with HIF-1, regulates a multitude of biological
processes that help cells and tissues adapt to hypoxia.2 HIF
activity is controlled by iron- and 2-oxoglutarate–dependent
prolyl-4-hydroxylase domain (PHD) dioxygenases PHD1,
PHD2, and PHD3, which function as oxygen sensors. In
the presence of oxygen, PHD enzymes inhibit HIF activity
by
hydroxylating

proline
residues

Under
hypoxic
conditions,
PHD-
mediated hydroxylation is reduced and HIF signaling is
activated. This, in turn, results in the transcriptional activa-
tion of multiple HIF target genes, including EPO and iron
metabolism genes.21 HIF prolyl-4-hydroxylase (PH) in-
hibitors, compounds that reversibly inhibit PHD catalytic
activity, represent a promising new class of drugs that activate
HIF signaling and increase endogenous EPO production,
while also simultaneously stimulating iron metabolism.2,22
Vadadustat, also known as AKB-6548, is a novel, titratable,
oral HIF-PH inhibitor in development for the treatment of
anemia in both nondialysis-dependent (NDD) and dialysis-
dependent CKD patients. In early clinical studies, vadadu-
stat was well-tolerated in healthy volunteers and patients with
CKD, where it increased reticulocytes, plasma EPO, and Hb
levels in a dose-dependent manner.23,24 The increase in
plasma EPO levels seen with vadadustat was comparable in
magnitude to that occurring physiologically at moderate
altitude and showed a normal diurnal pattern with a return to
baseline levels prior to the next dose.24 Earlier results also
showed that vadadustat improved iron homeostasis by
decreasing hepcidin and increasing transferrin levels.23 Taken
together,
once-daily
oral
administration
of
vadadustat,
titrated to increase and maintain Hb in the target range, may
provide multiple advantages over conventional ESAs. Here we
report the results of a phase 2b study evaluating vadadustat in
NDD patients with stages 3a to 5 CKD.
RESULTS
Patient characteristics and disposition
We conducted a 20-week, phase 2b multicenter, randomized,
double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the ability of
oral, once-daily vadadustat to correct anemia in patients with
NDD-CKD. Patients with NDD-CKD stages 3a/b, 4, and 5
enrolled from 61 sites were grouped based on ESA treatment
status and Hb level at screening (Supplementary Table S1):
group 1 were ESA treatment naïve and Hb #10.5 g/dl; group
2 were previously treated with ESA and Hb #10.5 g/dl; group
3 were actively treated with ESA and Hb $9.5 g/dl to #12.0
g/dl. Within each group, patients were randomized 2:1 to
receive vadadustat or placebo and stratified according to CKD
stage and the presence or absence of diabetes mellitus.
The intent-to-treat population included 210 patients who
received the study drug (vadadustat, n ¼ 138; placebo, n ¼
72) and were included in the safety analyses. The modified
intent-to-treat population, used for all efficacy analyses,
comprised 208 patients who had a baseline and $1 post-
baseline Hb and red blood cell measurement (vadadustat, n ¼
136; placebo, n ¼ 72). The per-protocol population, pre-
specified as the primary population to be used to analyze the
primary endpoint, included all patients in the modified
intent-to-treat population who also completed the study, had
efficacy data through week 20, were $80% compliant with
study medication, and had no major protocol deviations.
There were 160 patients who qualified for the per-protocol
population (Supplementary Figure S1). Of the 210 patients
who received the study drug, 81% (n ¼ 112) in the vadadustat
group and 88% (n ¼ 63) in the placebo group completed
treatment through to week 20 of the study. Treatment groups
were matched for demographic and disease-related charac-
teristics at baseline as outlined in Table 1.
Primary endpoint
The primary endpoint of the study was the percentage of
patients who, during the last 2 weeks of treatment, achieved
or maintained a mean Hb level of $11.0 g/dl or an increase in
Hb of $1.2 g/dl over the predose average (average of the 2 Hb
values obtained before dosing at screening and baseline).
Patients who received ESA or transfusion as rescue therapy
were counted as treatment failures. Patients who received
transfusion for nonrescue reasons were excluded from the
primary analysis.
Treatment with vadadustat raised and maintained Hb
levels in patients with anemia secondary to CKD (Table 2). In
the per-protocol population, 54.9% of patients treated with

 vadadustat achieved the primary endpoint compared with
10.3% of placebo-treated patients (P < 0.0001). Based on
estimated odds ratio, patients treated with vadadustat were
approximately 11.5 times more likely than patients treated
with placebo to achieve a successful Hb response (P ¼ 0.0001)
(Table 2).
Secondary and additional endpoints
Hemoglobin.
Vadadustat increased and maintained Hb
levels in patients throughout the 20-week study (Figure 1). By
week 2, mean Hb levels in the vadadustat group had increased
significantly from baseline; Hb levels plateaued by weeks 6 to
8 and were sustained throughout the 20 weeks of treatment
(Figure 1). Hb response versus time in each of the 3 study
groups based on ESA treatment status is displayed in
Supplementary Figure S2. Hb excursions $13 g/dl occurred
in only 4.3% (6 of 138) of patients in the vadadustat group. A
post hoc analysis showed that from weeks 8 to 20, 71.2% of all
Hb measurements in the vadadustat group and 42.7% in the
placebo group were between 10 and <12 g/dl; 8.9% of Hb
measurements in the vadadustat group were between 12.0 and
12.9 g/dl and 1% was $13.0 g/dl and none in the placebo
group were $12.0 g/dl.
ESA and transfusion rescue.
Fewer patients in the vada-
dustat group (4.4%) than in the placebo group (16.7%)
received ESA rescue therapy during the study. Of the 6
vadadustat-treated patients who received ESA during the
study, 4 patients did not meet the protocol-specified criteria
for ESA rescue; of the other 2, 1 was in the previously treated
group, and 1 in the actively treated group. Of the 12 placebo
patients who received ESA rescue, 2 patients did not meet the
protocol-specified criteria; of the remaining 10, 1 was in the
treatment naïve group, 3 were in the previously treated group,
and 6 were in the actively treated group. None of the
vadadustat-treated patients and 1 placebo-treated patient
received transfusion rescue during the trial.
Absolute reticulocyte count.
An increase from baseline in
mean absolute reticulocyte count was observed in the vada-
dustat group at week 2 (þ0.022 � 106/ml) versus a slight
decrease in the placebo group (–0.005 � 106/ml; P ¼ 0.0001).
The mean reticulocyte count in the vadadustat group grad-
ually declined and plateaued by weeks 6 to 8 at a level
significantly higher than that of the placebo group, reflecting
the new Hb baseline (Figure 2).
Iron parameters.
Significant decreases in hepcidin and
ferritin, and a significant increase in total iron-binding ca-
pacity were observed in the vadadustat group compared with
the placebo group at each postbaseline assessment (Figure 3a
to c). Serum iron and transferrin saturation were similar in
the 2 treatment groups throughout the study.
At baseline, 47.1% of patients in the vadadustat group and
45.8% in the placebo group were receiving iron supplemen-
tation. At the end of the 20-week trial, 59.6% of patients in
the vadadustat group and 52.8% in the placebo group were
receiving iron supplementation. During the study, 2.9% of
patients (4 of 136) in the vadadustat group and none of the
patients in the placebo group received i.v. iron.
Dosage and compliance.
The starting dose of vadadustat
at study entry was 450 mg once daily; the mean dose of
vadadustat at week 19 was 450 mg once daily. The majority of
patients (89%, 120 of 135) in the vadadustat group achieved
and maintained a stable Hb level with #2 dose adjustments
throughout the 20-week treatment period; 24% of patients
(33 of 135) required no dose adjustment. The proportion of
patients who were >80% compliant with treatment was
92.8% (128 of 138) in the vadadustat group and 94.4% (68 of
72) in the placebo group.
Safety
The percentage of patients who experienced $1 adverse event
(AE) was comparable between the vadadustat and placebo
groups (74.6% vs. 73.6%) (Table 3). Occurrence of $1 drug-
related AE was reported in 25.4% of vadadustat-treated pa-
tients (35 of 138) and 11.1% of placebo-treated patients (8 of
72). AEs in both treatment groups were primarily mild or
moderate in severity. Most commonly reported drug-related
AEs in the vadadustat group included diarrhea (4.3%) and
nausea (4.3%), whereas diarrhea (2.8%) was the most
commonly reported drug-related AE in the placebo group.
Ten vadadustat-treated patients (7.2%) and 3 placebo-treated
patients (4.2%) discontinued the study because of AEs.
There were no observed trends (either increases or de-
creases) in systolic (or diastolic) blood pressure values over
time and the distribution of systolic blood pressure values in
patients treated with vadadustat was similar to that of patients
treated with placebo. Hypertension was reported as an AE in
8.0% of vadadustat-treated patients (11 of 138) and 2.8% of
those treated with placebo (2 of 72); all of the patients had a
preexisting history of hypertension. Of the 11 patients on
vadadustat who had an AE of hypertension during the study, 1
subject had furosemide discontinued approximately 1 month
prior to the event. Otherwise, no subject had an interruption or
decrease in the dose of antihypertensive agents prior to the
onset of the AE of hypertension and no subject discontinued
vadadustat treatment because of hypertension.

vadadustat-treated
patients
(23.9%)
reported $1 serious adverse event (SAE), as did 11 placebo-
treated patients (15.3%); the higher incidence of SAEs was
primarily due to a higher incidence of renal-related SAEs in the
vadadustat group (10.1%) compared with the placebo group
(2.8%). The requirement for initiation of dialysis, an objective
measure of the severity of renal SAEs, was evenly balanced be-
tween the vadadustat (11 of 138, 8.0%) and placebo (7 of 72,
9.7%) groups. No serious renal-related events were attributed to
the study medication based on the investigators’ decision.
Between-group analyses revealed no statistically significant
differences between the vadadustat and placebo groups in the
mean change from baseline in vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF) levels at week 12 or end of treatment
(Figure 3d). Mean decreases from baseline in cystatin C levels
were observed in the vadadustat group at week 12 and end of
treatment (nonsignificant), whereas significant mean increases
from baseline in cystatin C were observed in the placebo group.
Analysis between the 2 treatment groups showed that the mean
change from baseline to end of treatment in cystatin C levels
was significantly less in the vadadustat group (34.9 ng/ml) than
in the placebo group (298.2 ng/ml; P ¼ 0.0063). No changes
from baseline were reported in vital signs or hematological
tests. There were no reported effects of vadadustat on electro-
cardiogram measurements. With the exception of 1 patient in
the vadadustat group who had an increase in liver function test,
deemed possibly related to study medication, no other changes
in liver function tests (serum alkaline phosphatase, alanine
transaminase, aspartate transaminase, lactate dehydrogenase,
total bilirubin, albumin, or total protein), renal function tests
(serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, or cystatin C), serum
electrolytes, serum lipids (serum total cholesterol, low-density
lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, or
triglycerides), serum bicarbonate, or serum creatine kinase
were reported in either treatment group during the study.
Three deaths were reported among the 138 subjects who
were treated with vadadustat, for an overall mortality rate of
2.2%. The causes of death were sudden cardiac death, cardiac
arrest, and myocardial ischemia. A 71-year-old patient with
type 2 diabetes, hypertension, congestive heart failure, atrial
fibrillation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary
hypertension, and sleep apnea receiving continuous oxygen
died of a sudden cardiac arrest 2 days posttreatment. A 54-year-
old patient with hypertension and severe peripheral artery
disease presented to the hospital with a 4-day history of wors-
ening leg pain and was admitted to intensive care for sepsis and
an ischemic foot leading to an above-the-knee amputation.

 complications including right frontal lobe stroke, acute renal
failure, and 2 cardiac arrests. Life support was withheld
following the second cardiac arrest. The deaths in these 2
subjects were considered to be unrelated to the study medica-
tion. The third death was attributed to myocardial ischemia in a
65-year-old patient with type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and
obesity. This death was considered to have a possible relation-
ship to the study medication as the subject died at home, and no
autopsy was performed documenting the cause of death. No
deaths were reported among the 72-placebo-treated patients.
DISCUSSION
Here we report the results from a 20-week placebo-controlled
phase 2b study in patients with NDD-CKD treated with the
oral once-daily HIF-PH inhibitor vadadustat. Vadadustat
raised and maintained Hb levels in a predictable manner,
while minimizing Hb excursions >13 g/dl and increasing iron
mobilization.
Targeting the HIF oxygen-sensing pathway has the po-
tential to provide a more physiologic approach to treating
anemia than conventional ESA therapy,2,22 which relies on the
administration of high doses of recombinant EPO agents and
can result in worsening hypertension and increased CV
risk.13–18,25 Although the underlying pathogenic mechanisms
are unclear, out-of-target-range Hb oscillations and supra-
physiologic plasma EPO levels are likely to play a causal role
in the pathogenesis of adverse CVevents associated with high-
dose recombinant EPO therapy.15,26,27
Patients treated with vadadustat were approximately 11.5
times more likely than patients treated with placebo to ach-
ieve the primary endpoint. The protocol-specified algorithm
resulted in a controlled rise in Hb and maintenance of Hb
levels within the clinically desired range, while the reticulocyte
profile mimicked the predicted response to altitude-associated
hypoxia.28 Very few patients on vadadustat experienced Hb
excursions $13.0 g/dl, which have been associated with an
increased
risk
of
hypertension
and
adverse
CV out-
comes.10,11,29–31 The majority of patients required #2 dose
adjustments during the 20-week treatment period.
An improvement in parameters of iron metabolism was
also observed with vadadustat. Indeed, significant reduction
of hepcidin and ferritin levels, and increase in total iron-
binding capacity indicated enhanced iron utilization in pa-
tients treated with vadadustat, which may reduce the need for
iron supplementation compared with conventional ESA
therapies. This will be further evaluated in the phase 3 pro-
gram. Recent genetic studies in mice have shown that HIF
regulates erythropoiesis by coordinating the transcriptional
induction of EPO with the enhanced expression of multiple
genes involved in regulating iron metabolism.2 In particular,
HIF-2 appears to play a key role in iron absorption under

 hypoxic conditions, suggesting a potential mechanism by
which vadadustat directly enhances iron metabolism.32–34 The
effects of vadadustat on hepcidin levels are most likely indi-
rect, as previous studies have shown that increased erythro-
poietic activity is required for hepcidin suppression in the
context of systemic HIF activation.35–37
Because HIF is a very pleiotropic transcription factor that
regulates a multitude of physiologic hypoxia responses, HIF-
PH inhibitors have the potential to significantly impact
normal physiology and metabolic homeostasis in CKD pa-
tients. In particular, the effects of controlled, repeated sys-
temic HIF activation on the CV system, glucose and fat
metabolism, and the progression of CKD are not known. In
our phase 2b trial, vadadustat was well tolerated by patients
and its AE profile was generally similar to that of placebo,
which is consistent with previous studies, and typical of the
CKD population.23,24 The observed number of deaths in this
study was consistent with that expected (2–4 on vadadustat,
1–2 on placebo) based on the severity of disease, natural
mortality rate, and 2:1 randomization of patients.38 There
was an imbalance in SAEs reported during the study period,
primarily related to renal events and likely due to in-
consistencies in the reporting of severity for renal-associated
AEs leading to dialysis, as well as whether investigators re-
ported AEs that led to dialysis with a renal or nonrenal term.
The requirement for initiation of dialysis, an objective
measure of the severity of renal AEs, was evenly balanced
between the vadadustat and placebo groups. Additionally, the
number of patients who discontinued from the study
because of worsening CKD that required dialysis was com-
parable between the vadadustat (4.3%) and placebo (5.6%)
groups.
Preclinical studies in animal models have predicted that
systemic HIF activation has the potential to alter glucose and
fat and mitochondrial metabolism.39–41 Indeed, other HIF-
PH inhibitors, which are currently undergoing evaluation in
clinical anemia trials, have been shown to decrease serum
cholesterol levels;42 however, the molecular mechanisms that
underlie these effects are not well understood. In contrast, no
effect on serum lipid levels was associated with vadadustat
treatment.
A major safety concern of targeting the HIF pathway is the
potential for increased production of VEGF. VEGF is a HIF-
regulated
angiogenic
growth
factor
and
increasing
its
expression has been shown to disrupt vascular homeostasis,
to promote vasculopathies, and to enhance tumor progres-
sion and metastatic potential.43,44 Plasma VEGF levels were
not increased with vadadustat treatment in this phase 2b trial,
which is consistent with previous studies.23,24 Ongoing phase
3 studies will continue to monitor plasma VEGF levels in
vadadustat-treated subjects.
HIF is involved in the regulation of vascular tone and blood
pressure and is also known to contribute to the development
of pulmonary hypertension.22,45,46 Although hypertension was
reported more frequently as an AE in the vadadustat group, all
of the subjects for whom hypertension was reported as an AE
had an established history of hypertension and no general
pattern of change in blood pressure values or pulse rate was
observed during the study. Phase 3 trials comparing vadadu-
stat with ESA therapy will help elucidate any differences be-
tween these therapies on blood pressure.
In summary, we report the results of the first phase 2b
study of vadadustat, a novel HIF-PH inhibitor that provides
an effective and well-tolerated, titratable, once-daily oral
therapy for correcting anemia in patients with CKD.
Vadadustat offers several advantages over existing ESA
therapy as it generates a more physiologic profile of plasma
EPO that maintains Hb levels with minimal fluctuations and
improves iron absorption and mobilization. Our study
results provide justification for conducting phase 3 clinical
investigations to further evaluate the safety and efficacy of
vadadustat.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Ethical approval
The study (ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT01906489) was conducted

 Study design, dosing algorithm, and study conduct
Eligible patients were men and women aged 18 years or older with a
diagnosis of CKD stages 3a to 5 who were not expected to initiate
maintenance dialysis during the course of the study. Additional in-
clusion criteria included anemia secondary to CKD with an ESA
status and screening Hb level that met 1 of the 3 study groups
criteria;
a
ferritin
level
$50
ng/ml
with
a
transferrin
saturation $18%, or a ferritin level $100 ng/ml, regardless of
transferrin saturation. A comprehensive list of eligibility criteria is
provided in the Supplementary Information.
Once-daily vadadustat was initiated at 450 mg, and titrated by 1
tablet (150 mg) according to Hb response (maximum of 600 mg and
minimum of 150 mg). Dose adjustment was permitted per the
protocol-specified dosing algorithm, and suspended if Hb $13.0 g/dl.
Oral iron supplementation was permitted throughout the study to
maintain ferritin levels between 50 and 300 ng/ml; i.v. iron was only
allowed for patients who were intolerant of oral iron. Rescue therapy
with ESA was permitted (but not mandated) if Hb was #9 g/dl in
groups 1 and 2, or if Hb was #9.4 g/dl in group 3; the higher
threshold for initiation of rescue for group 3 was selected assuming
the investigators’ reluctance to permit Hb levels to decrease sub-
stantially in a previously treated population.
Clinical assessments, including Hb and other hematologic pa-
rameters, iron indices, and safety assessments were conducted at
screening, baseline (day 1), during the treatment period (weeks 2, 4,
6, 8, 12, 16, and 19), at the end-of-treatment visit (week 20 or early
withdrawal), and at the posttreatment follow-up visit that was
conducted 4 weeks after the last dose of study medication. Blood
samples for determination of hepcidin and other biomarkers were
assessed at baseline, week 12, and the end-of-treatment visits. Safety
assessments included vital signs, electrocardiograms, AEs, complete
blood counts with differential, serum chemistries, cystatin C, lipid
profiles, VEGF, and pregnancy tests.
Statistical analysis
Sample size and power were calculated using the likelihood ratio chi-
square test. Using a randomization ratio of 2:1 for vadadustat to
placebo, with a total of 160 evaluable patients for the primary
analysis, we expected 87% power to detect the difference in the
predicted success rates between vadadustat (60%) and placebo (20%)
across the 3 study groups, at the a ¼ 0.05 level. Assuming 20% of
randomized patients would be lost due to attrition, the target sample
size of 200 patients was selected in order to yield 160 evaluable
patients for the primary analysis.
Efficacy analyses conducted for the primary and secondary
endpoints used Fisher exact test to compare percentage of success of
vadadustat to placebo. Odds ratio estimates and 95% confidence
intervals were calculated for treatment comparison by adjusting
explanatory variables.
During safety analyses, treatment-emergent AEs were coded into
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA), version
16.0, System Organ Classes and Preferred Terms and displayed in a
frequency table by treatment group. Frequency tables were produced
to display all AEs by severity, relationship to study medication, SAEs,
and AEs that resulted in discontinuation of study medication.
