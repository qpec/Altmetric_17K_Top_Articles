 Abstract
Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disorder where T cells attack neurons in the central 
nervous system (CNS) leading to demyelination and neurological deficits. A driver of increased 
MS risk is the soluble form of the interleukin-7 receptor alpha chain gene (sIL7R), produced by 
alternative splicing of IL7R exon 6. Here, we identified the RNA helicase DDX39B as a potent 
activator of this exon and consequently a repressor of sIL7R, and found strong genetic association 
of DDX39B with MS risk. Indeed, we showed that a genetic variant in the 5′ UTR of DDX39B 
reduces translation of DDX39B mRNAs and increases MS risk. Importantly, this DDX39B variant 
showed strong genetic and functional epistasis with allelic variants in IL7R exon 6. This study 
establishes the occurrence of biological epistasis in humans and provides mechanistic insight into 
the regulation of IL7R exon 6 splicing and its impact on MS risk.

Increased risk for Multiple Sclerosis (MS), an autoimmune disease that damages the central 
nervous system, is associated with altered alternative splicing of Interleukin 7 receptor (IL7R) 
mRNAs that leads to elevated soluble IL7R. Here, we identify the RNA helicase DDX39B as a 
potent regulator of IL7R splicing, a repressor of soluble IL7R formation and a modifier of MS 
risk. We show that an MS-associated DDX39B 5′ UTR variant reduces DDX39B protein levels 
and shows strong genetic and functional epistasis with variants in IL7R.
Introduction
MS is characterized by self-reactive T cell mediated damage to neuronal myelin sheaths in 
the CNS that leads to axonal demyelination, neuronal death and progressive neurological 
dysfunction. This breach of immunological tolerance is thought to originate from complex 
interactions between environmental and genetic factors. Addressing the latter, we and others 
uncovered a role for IL7R in MS susceptibility (Gregory et al., 2007; International Multiple 
Sclerosis Genetics et al., 2007; Lundmark et al., 2007). Together with the common gamma

 chain (γc), IL7R forms a functional cell surface receptor for IL7, which is essential for 
survival, proliferation, maintenance and homeostasis of T cells (Fry and Mackall, 2005; 
Mazzucchelli and Durum, 2007), and may also be required for optimal TCR-mediated 
activation of CD4+ T cells (Lawson et al., 2015) thought to drive the initial inflammatory 
phase of MS (Sospedra and Martin, 2005). Importantly, IL7R expression is precisely and 
dynamically controlled throughout lymphopoiesis and upon T cell activation (Alves et al., 
2008; Mazzucchelli and Durum, 2007; Munitic et al., 2004; Park et al., 2004), and its 
modulation has profound effects on immunological function as knockout of IL7R in mice 
and loss-of-function mutations in humans cause lymphopaenia and severe combined 
immunodeficiency (Maraskovsky et al., 1996; Peschon et al., 1994; Puel et al., 1998; 
Roifman et al., 2000). Relevant to the establishment of self-tolerance, dynamic regulation of 
IL7R throughout lymphopoiesis seems critical for selection of self-tolerant T cells (Dooms, 
2013).
The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs6897932 within exon 6 of IL7R is strongly 
and reproducibly associated with MS, where the C allele of the variant is associated with 
elevated risk (Gregory et al., 2007; International Multiple Sclerosis Genetics et al., 2007; 
Lundmark et al., 2007). This variant introduces a non-synonymous threonine to isoleucine 
change at amino acid position 244, but this change does not appear to alter IL7 signaling 
(unpublished results). Importantly, we showed that the risk allele enhances skipping of exon 
6 (Evsyukova et al., 2013; Gregory et al., 2007), increasing the fraction of mRNAs that code 
for a secreted form of the receptor (sIL7R), and this correlates with increased plasma levels 
of sIL7R (Hoe et al., 2010; Lundstrom et al., 2013). Elevated levels of sIL7R have been 
shown to exacerbate the severity of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a 
mouse model of MS, presumably by enhancing the activity or bioavailability of IL7 
(Lundstrom et al., 2013). These results link alternative splicing of IL7R to the pathogenesis 
of MS.
To better understand how IL7R exon 6 is regulated, we pursued the discovery of both cis-
acting elements and trans-acting factors controlling splicing of the exon. Previously we 
identified several important cis-acting elements, among them a critically important exonic 
splicing enhancer (ESE2), immediately downstream of rs6897932, whose mutation (ΔESE2) 
inhibited inclusion of exon 6 (Evsyukova et al., 2013). By combining RNA affinity 
chromatography with mass spectrometry, we discovered factors interacting with exon 6 and 
flanking sequences (Evsyukova et al., 2013) and here we identified those that required ESE2 
to bind. We showed that knockdown of one of these factors, the DEAD Box Polypeptide 
39B (DDX39B, also known as UAP56/BAT1), increased IL7R exon 6 skipping in cell lines 
and in primary CD4+ T cells, and up-regulated sIL7R secretion. This is relevant in vivo since 
here we established that genetic variants within the DDX39B locus were associated with 
increased genetic risk of MS. We further demonstrated that the risk allele of one of these 
variants, rs2523506, reduces DDX39B protein level by diminishing the efficiency of 
DDX39B mRNA translation. Importantly, the increased risk associated with this variant 
showed significant epistasis with rs6897932 in IL7R. This study demonstrates the 
occurrence of genetic and functional epistasis of two MS risk loci in humans and provides a 
mechanistic explanation for the regulation of IL7R alternative splicing as a driver of MS 
risk. Furthermore, considering that variants in both IL7R and DDX39B have been associated

 with other autoimmune diseases (Anderson et al., 2011; Cheong et al., 2001; Degli-Esposti 
et al., 1992; Nakamura et al., 2012; Paternoster et al., 2012; Quinones-Lombrana et al., 
2008; Todd et al., 2007), the results of this study could have a broader impact on shared 
mechanisms in autoimmunity.
Results
DDX39B is a potent activator of IL7R exon 6
To identify trans-acting factors controlling splicing of IL7R exon 6, we conducted an 
unbiased proteomic screen consisting of RNA affinity chromatography and mass 
spectrometry. Using different sets of IL7R exon 6 RNAs and HeLa nuclear extracts we 
identified a total of 89 candidate trans-factors (Evsyukova et al., 2013). Importantly, we 
showed that both HeLa and Jurkat T cells recapitulate the SNP rs6897932- and ESE2-
dependent changes in IL7R exon 6 splicing (Fig. S1), implying exon 6 is similarly regulated 
in HeLa and T cells. In the experiments presented here, we used RNAs encompassing the 
first 40 nucleotides (nt) of exon 6, either wild type or ΔESE2 (both containing the C allele of 
rs6897932), to identify factors binding in the vicinity of rs6897932 and the critical ESE2. 
We identified 66 candidate factors with these short RNAs, 12 of which showed dependency 
on ESE2 (Table S1). The two top candidates whose binding was ESE2-dependent were the 
microtubule-associated protein 4 (MAP4) and the RNA helicase DDX39B. Functional 
studies ruled out a role for MAP4 in IL7R exon 6 splicing (data not shown) and thus we 
focused on DDX39B.
To determine whether DDX39B regulates splicing of IL7R exon 6, we silenced its 
expression in HeLa cells using two independent siRNAs (Fig. 1A), and determined the 
impact on exon 6 splicing in transcripts from both an IL7R reporter minigene and the 
endogenous IL7R gene. Knockdown of DDX39B caused a significant increase in exon 6 
skipping in transcripts from both the minigene (Fig. 1B) and endogenous gene (Fig. 1C). 
This effect cannot be explained by differential effects of DDX39B on stability of IL7R 
transcript isoforms as both isoforms decayed with similar rates in control and DDX39B-
depleted cells (data not shown). Importantly, we were able to rescue exon 6 splicing in 
endogenous IL7R transcripts by complementing DDX39B-depleted cells with a siRNA-
resistant cDNA trans-gene encoding wild type DDX39B (Fig. 1E) but not a helicase-
defective mutant (Fig. 1F). In these experiments, DDX39B depletion also led to elevated 
abundance of overall IL7R transcripts (confirmed by RT-qPCR; data not shown), which may 
be a secondary effect of DDX39B depletion, as it appeared only at later time points during 
knockdown. Similar rescue experiments conducted with an ESE2 mutant reporter strongly 
suggested there is no DDX39B effect in the absence of this ESE (Fig. S2). These results 
indicated the splicing phenotype observed upon transfection of DDX39B siRNAs was 
specifically driven by DDX39B protein depletion rather than an off-target effect of the 
siRNAs, and that DDX39B requires its helicase activity and an intact ESE2 to activate exon 
6 inclusion. Most importantly, we showed that DDX39B knockdown elevated the secretion 
of sIL7R (Fig. 1D).
Previous experiments suggested that DDX39B interacts with U2AF65 in the vicinity of the 
branchpoint sequence (BP) to promote constitutive pre-mRNA splicing (Fleckner et al., 
Galarza-Muñoz et al.

 1997; Shen et al., 2008; Shen et al., 2007). Since our data revealed a role for DDX39B in 
alternative splicing, we wondered whether DDX39B silencing affects other alternative 
splicing events. A pilot investigation in HeLa cells identified 75 alternative splicing events 
that were changed upon DDX39B depletion (Table S2), and a significant fraction were exon 
skipping events, consistent with DDX39B acting as a splicing activator. We also investigated 
how sensitive inclusion of IL7R exon 6 was to silencing of other RNA helicases. 
Knockdown of DDX5, a helicase implicated in both transcriptional and post-transcriptional 
control (Huang et al., 2015), and DDX23, the U5 snRNP-associated human homologue of 
PRP28 (Teigelkamp et al., 1997), caused small effects in exon 6 skipping, whereas 
knockdown of DDX17, another RNA helicase with alternative splicing activity (Honig et al., 
2002) had no effect (Fig. S3). These results suggest that IL7R exon 6 is particularly sensitive 
to DDX39B levels and indicate that this RNA helicase impacts multiple alternative splicing 
events. Collectively, these experiments demonstrated that DDX39B is an important activator 
of IL7R exon 6 splicing, and a potent repressor of sIL7R.
DDX39B is genetically associated with MS risk
To test whether genes encoding regulators of IL7R exon 6 are associated with MS 
susceptibility, we performed parallel genetic association analyses of autosomal genes 
encoding candidate trans-acting factors identified in our proteomics screen. When candidate 
factors form part of macromolecular complexes, we added the other components of such 
complexes for a total of 116 candidate genes. We combined data from six genetic cohorts of 
non-overlapping subjects of European descent from previously published meta-analyses 
(Patsopoulos et al., 2011), which included 4,088 MS cases and 7,444 controls. Genotype 
data were available for 4,882 SNPs in 96 of the 116 candidate genes (minor allele frequency 
(MAF) ≥ 1%; imputation information score ≥ 80%). Variants within +/− 10 kilobases (kb) of 
candidate genes were analyzed using meta-analytic logistic regression models adjusted for 
population stratification and cohort origin. A total of 58 SNPs reached genome-wide 
statistical significance (p ≤ 5.0 × 10−8), all of which resided within the DDX39B gene locus 
(Table S3).
The DDX39B gene is located within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). This 
region harbors the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes, the primary genetic drivers of MS 
susceptibility (International Multiple Sclerosis Genetics et al., 2015; Patsopoulos et al., 
2013), and exhibits extended linkage disequilibrium (LD) (de Bakker et al., 2006). 
Accordingly, it was imperative to establish whether DDX39B variants were associated with 
increased MS risk independent of the known HLA risk factors, rather than reporting on HLA 
risk variants in LD. To this end, we further refined our genetic model to adjust for all known 
HLA MS risk variants: HLA-DRB1*15:01, HLA-DRB1*03:01, HLA-DRB1*13:01, HLA-
DRB1*04:04, HLA-DRB1*04:01, HLA-DRB1*14:01, HLA-A*02:01, rs9277489, HLA-
B*37:01, and HLA-B*38:01 (hereafter referred to as HLA-adjusted model). There were 15 
variants in DDX39B with strong association with MS risk after correction for HLA risk 
alleles (p ≤ 5.0 × 10−8) (Fig. 2; also see Table S3 and Fig. S4). We used this HLA-adjusted 
model to inform subsequent functional analyses of DDX39B variants displaying strong 
association with MS risk. While there were four genes within the associated region (Fig. 2), 
the functional experiments demonstrating robust repression of sIL7R by DDX39B (Fig. 1)

 strongly suggested that DDX39B drives this association and reduces MS risk by decreasing 
sIL7R expression.
Allele-specific DDX39B protein expression
We next investigated whether any of the DDX39B MS-associated variants altered its activity. 
Because none of the associated variants are located in the coding region, we hypothesized 
that the functional SNP(s) act by regulating DDX39B expression. Three of the associated 
variants are located within the transcriptional unit of the gene: rs2523506 (exon 1), 
rs2523512 (intron 3) and rs2516478 (intron 9) (Fig. 3A). We tested whether rs2523512 in 
intron 3 could impact splicing of exons 3 and 4, and found no effect (data not shown). We 
next focused on rs2523506 located in the 5′ UTR of DDX39B transcripts where it could 
alter mRNA levels and/or their translation efficiency. We first asked whether rs2523506 
genotype correlated with changes in DDX39B transcript levels in peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from relapsing-remitting MS patients and healthy 
controls. Quantification of the DDX39B mRNAs showed that they did not (Fig. 3B, left), 
indicating that MS risk association could not be explained by decreased DDX39B mRNA 
levels.
We next asked whether rs2523506 could influence translational efficiency of DDX39B 
mRNAs, which would lead to differential abundances of DDX39B protein. To address this, 
we initially mined a proteomics database where relative protein abundances were quantified 
for 5,953 genes in lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) (Wu et al., 2013). We found reduced 
DDX39B protein levels in cell lines heterozygous at rs2523506 (AC) compared to cells 
homozygous for the protective allele (CC) in LCLs from an African population (Yoruba in 
Ibadan, Nigeria [YRI]) (Fig. S5A). Unfortunately, no data were available for the 
homozygous risk allele (AA). This correlation with DDX39B levels was not detected in 
LCLs from an European population (Utah residents with ancestry from northern and western 
Europe [CEU]), which also lacked data for the AA genotype (Fig. S5B), suggesting that 
regulation of DDX39B levels is complex and may be differentially modified by other loci or 
non-genetic factors between these LCL populations. Nonetheless, this analysis supported the 
hypothesis that the risk allele of rs2523506 can reduce DDX39B protein expression.
To rigorously test the correlation between DDX39B protein levels and rs2523506 alleles we 
experimentally analyzed 25 LCLs of African origin (12 CC, 11 AC and 2 AA) and 27 LCLs 
of European origin (12 CC, 12 AC and 3 AA). We used LCLs from two African populations, 
YRI and Esan in Nigeria (ESN), which were entirely distinct from the previously analyzed 
cell lines (Wu et al., 2013), thereby allowing us to test for replication of the correlation 
between rs2523506 and DDX39B protein levels. Given the lack of correlation in CEU LCLs 
and concerns associated with these cell lines being more extensively passaged than the other 
LCLs (Yuan et al., 2015), we analyzed LCLs established more recently from Iberian 
populations in Spain (IBS). We first checked levels of DDX39B mRNAs and, similar to 
findings in PBMCs, found no significant differences in DDX39B mRNA levels by 
rs2523506 genotype in either the African (YRI/ESN) or European (IBS) LCLs (Fig. 3B). 
Additionally, we assessed whether rs2523506 altered expression of genes in the vicinity of 
DDX39B (MICB, ATP6V1G2, NFKBIL1, LTA, TNF and LTB) in the African LCLs and 
Galarza-Muñoz et al.

 found no difference in RNA levels by rs2523506 genotype (Fig. S6A). Furthermore, 
silencing of vicinal genes that were expressed in HeLa cells had no effect on IL7R exon 6 
splicing (Fig. S6B). These analyses indicated rs2523506 does not affect RNA levels of other 
genes within the associated region, consistent with this variant driving MS risk via its impact 
on DDX39B protein expression.
We next analyzed DDX39B protein levels by western blot in both populations of LCL (Fig. 
3C). Analysis in the African LCLs revealed a dose-dependent correlation of the risk allele of 
rs2523506 with reduced DDX39B protein levels, with approximately 25% reduction in AC 
lines and 50% reduction in AA lines compared to CC lines (Fig. 3C, left). We observed a 
similar correlation in DDX39B protein levels in the European LCLs, albeit to a lesser extent, 
and statistically significant when comparing CC and AA lines (Fig. 3C, right). Thus, we 
concluded that the A risk allele of rs2523506 is associated with decreased DDX39B protein 
levels. Moreover, given that DDX39B mRNA levels were unaltered by rs2523506 genotype, 
we hypothesized that the rs2523506 risk allele functions by reducing the DDX39B mRNA 
translation.
rs2523506 controls translation efficiency of DDX39B mRNAs
To investigate whether rs2523506 influences translational efficiency of DDX39B transcripts, 
we generated luciferase reporters containing the DDX39B 5′ UTR variants. In addition to 
the alternative alleles of rs2523506 (C/A), the 5′ UTR of DDX39B transcripts is further 
modified by alternative 3′ splice sites (3′ss) within exon 2 (3′ss-1 and 3′ss-2 in Figure 3A). 
Therefore, to precisely mimic the naturally occurring DDX39B 5′ UTR variants, we 
generated reporters reflecting the use of the different 3′ss in exon 2 and the alternative 
alleles of rs2523506 (C/A) (Fig. 4A). These reporters were transiently transfected into HeLa 
cells together with a Firefly luciferase (F-Luc) transfection control, and translational 
efficiency was determined by quantifying mRNA and luciferase levels, each normalized to 
the F-Luc control. This analysis revealed approximately 20–30% reduction in translational 
efficiency of the reporters containing the A risk allele compared to the C allele (Fig. 4B). 
Importantly, this effect of rs2523506 on translational efficiency largely explains the 
reduction in DDX39B protein levels observed between CC and AA LCLs. Taken together 
with the results in Figure 3, we concluded that the A risk allele of rs2523506 decreases 
DDX39B protein levels by reducing the translational efficiency of DDX39B transcripts.
Gene-gene interaction between DDX39B and IL7R
Centered on the findings that the risk allele of rs2523506 reduces DDX39B protein level, 
and both the risk allele of IL7R rs6897932 and knockdown of DDX39B increased skipping 
of IL7R exon 6, we hypothesized a functional relationship between rs6897932 in IL7R and 
rs2523506 in DDX39B. This hypothesis predicted that carriers of risk alleles in both genes 
(C in IL7R, and A in DDX39B) would exhibit higher risk of MS. We therefore tested for 
evidence of multiplicative interaction (additive increase on the log odds scale) between 
rs2523506 and rs6897932 using logistic regression modeling. The interaction model 
included the main effects for rs2523506 and rs6897932, and was adjusted for population 
ancestry, cohort origin and all MHC risk variants outside the DDX39B locus (HLA-adjusted 
model) (see Table S4). There was a significant interaction between rs2523506 and

 rs6897932 (p = 0.029), which was further investigated in rs6897932-stratified analyses with 
equivalent model adjustments. This approach revealed strong association between rs2523506 
and rs6897932 with MS risk (Table 1, top). We observed no elevated MS risk associated 
with DDX39B rs2523506 among individuals homozygous for the IL7R rs6897932 
protective allele (TT, N=742, odds ratio (OR) = 0.98, p = 0.904), however an effect was 
observed among IL7R rs6897932 heterozygotes (CT, N=4251, OR = 1.26, p = 7.3 × 10−4), 
and the magnitude and significance of the effect was strongest among individuals 
homozygous for the IL7R rs6897932 risk allele (CC, N=6239, OR = 1.39, p = 4.4 × 10−9). 
When testing for the reciprocal relationship, that is the risk associated with IL7R rs6897932 
in DDX39B rs2523506 stratified analyses (Table 1, middle), we observed a subtle 
association of IL7R in non-carriers of the rs2523506 risk allele (CC, N=7834, OR = 1.10, p 
= 0.021), and this effect was drastically modified by the presence of the rs2523506 risk 
allele (AC, N=3099, OR = 1.20, p = 5.1 × 10−3; AA, N=299, OR = 2.19, p = 7.5 × 10−4). We 
further tested our hypothesis by determining the joint genotypic effect for all combinations 
of rs2523506 and rs6897932 genotypes (Table 1, bottom). This analysis uncovered a strong 
epistasis between these variants as we observed increased MS risk only in carriers of at least 
one copy of the risk alleles at both loci (IL7R CT, DDX39B AC, N=1167, OR = 1.32, p = 
0.023), and this effect was strongest in individuals homozygous for the risk allele at both 
loci (IL7R CC, DDX39B AA, N=156, OR = 2.75, p = 4.5 × 10−7).
It should be noted that interaction between DDX39B and IL7R was not due to an interaction 
between IL7R and HLA-DRB1*15:01, the main genetic driver of MS (International 
Multiple Sclerosis Genetics et al., 2015; Patsopoulos et al., 2013), as we observed no 
evidence for a multiplicative interaction between rs6897932 and HLA-DRB1*15:01 with 
MS risk (Table S5). Taken together, we concluded that the risk alleles in DDX39B and IL7R 
show strong evidence of epistasis, with a robust dose-dependent effect, suggesting that the 
MS risk associated with low levels of DDX39B can be explained by its action on IL7R.
The epistasis between DDX39B rs2523506 and IL7R rs6897932 suggested the possibility of 
a functional interplay that could enhance skipping of IL7R exon 6 in carriers of the risk 
alleles at both loci. Indeed, knockdown of DDX39B revealed higher skipping of exon 6 in 
transcripts from a reporter carrying the risk allele of rs6897932 (IL7R-C) compared to the 
protective allele (IL7R-T) (Fig. 5). This result is consistent with exon 6 skipping being 
augmented by two insults: strengthening of a weak silencer by the risk allele of rs6897932 
(Evsyukova et al., 2013; Gregory et al., 2007) and reduced expression of the activator 
DDX39B. Collectively, our genetic and functional studies indicate that carriers of both IL7R 
and DDX39B risk alleles are at highest risk of developing MS, very likely due to increased 
expression of sIL7R.
DDX39B regulates IL7R exon 6 inclusion in primary CD4+ T cells
We then explored the effect of DDX39B knockdown on IL7R exon 6 splicing in CD4+ T 
cells isolated from healthy human donors who were either CC (Fig. 6A) or CT (Fig. 6B) at 
rs6897932 in IL7R. We transduced cells from six donors with lentiviruses expressing two 
independent shRNAs against DDX39B or a non-targeting control shRNA. Even though 
DDX39B knockdown was less efficient in primary CD4+ T cells than in HeLa cells, we

 observed similar increase in exon 6 skipping upon DDX39B depletion (Fig. 6). We also 
measured sIL7R levels by ELISA and found increased levels of sIL7R upon DDX39B 
knockdown in cells from all donors with one DDX39B shRNA (sh3) but only in cells from 
two donors with the second shRNA (sh5) (Fig. S10). While the lack of correlation of sIL7R 
levels with exon 6 skipping in cells transduced with sh5 remains unexplained, we note it 
could be due to the fact that the antibody used can detect all IL7R protein isoforms. 
Importantly, we observed higher levels of exon 6 skipping upon DDX39B depletion in CD4+ 
T cells from donors homozygous for the risk allele in IL7R (CC) than those from 
heterozygous (CT) (Fig. 6A and 6B), corroborating the results obtained with the IL7R 
splicing reporters (Fig. 5). These data are consistent with the observed DDX39B—IL7R 
epistasis above (Table 1). We concluded DDX39B plays an important role in promoting 
IL7R exon 6 inclusion in primary CD4+ T cells, thereby underscoring the importance of 
DDX39B in MS pathogenesis.
Discussion
We previously showed that the rs6897932 C allele in exon 6 of IL7R, which is strongly 
associated with MS susceptibility, increases skipping of exon 6 (Evsyukova et al., 2013; 
Gregory et al., 2007), and this correlates with elevated levels of circulating sIL7R (Hoe et 
al., 2010; Lundstrom et al., 2013). This is predicted to have important repercussions on the 
pathogenesis of MS as sIL7R has been shown to exacerbate the severity of EAE, a mouse 
model of MS (Lundstrom et al., 2013). Based on these findings, we proposed that trans-
acting factors controlling exon 6 splicing would be candidate genes for MS susceptibility. 
Using a multidisciplinary approach consisting of biochemical, molecular genetic, and human 
genetic investigations, we validated this proposal and showed that the RNA helicase 
DDX39B is 1) a potent trans-activator of IL7R exon 6 in cell lines and primary human CD4+ 
T cells, 2) a repressor of sIL7R, and 3) a novel risk factor for MS. Of the numerous 
DDX39B variants found to be strongly associated with MS risk, we identified rs2523506 as 
a putative functional variant that exhibits strong correlation with reduced DDX39B protein 
expression in LCLs. Indeed, functional studies with luciferase reporters showed that the risk 
allele of this 5′ UTR variant diminishes the translational efficiency mediated by DDX39B 
5′ UTRs, thereby directly linking the SNP to the observed changes in protein levels. 
Additionally, rs2523506 does not affect expression of nearby genes, including pro-
inflammatory cytokines of the tumor necrosis factor superfamily (TNF, LTA and LTB). 
These findings suggest that increased MS risk associated with DDX39B could largely result 
from its function on IL7R splicing.
DDX39B is a DEAD-box protein with known functions in constitutive pre-mRNA splicing 
(Shen et al., 2008; Shen et al., 2007) and nuclear export of mRNAs (Luo et al., 2001; 
Masuda et al., 2005; Strasser et al., 2002). We have not ruled out the possibility that the 
increased skipping of exon 6 observed upon DDX39B knockdown results from other 
functions of DDX39B, in particular mRNA nuclear export. This is unlikely, however, as we 
have previously shown that the effects of rs6897932 and ESE2 are recapitulated in in vitro 
splicing assays with HeLa nuclear extracts (Evsyukova et al., 2013), which implies a direct 
effect on exon 6 splicing rather than nuclear export. Moreover, the role of DDX39B in 
promoting exon 6 inclusion appears to be independent of its function in constitutive pre-

 mRNA splicing, wherein DDX39B facilitates recruitment of U2 snRNP to the branchpoint 
through its interaction with U2AF65. Here, we showed that DDX39B requires an intact 
ESE2 to promote inclusion of exon 6, as functionally supported by failure to pull-down 
DDX39B with ΔESE2 exon 6 RNAs, and the inability of DDX39B to affect exon 6 inclusion 
in the absence of ESE2. Based on these results, we propose that DDX39B binds to ESE2, 
directly or indirectly, to promote inclusion of IL7R exon 6, and by doing so it decreases 
sIL7R expression and reduces MS risk.
Using powerful genetic association analyses that interrogated candidate trans-acting factors 
identified in our proteomic screen, we uncovered DDX39B as the lone candidate trans-factor 
exhibiting strong association with MS risk independently of HLA risk variants. Interestingly, 
none of the associated variants in the HLA-adjusted model had an effect before correction 
for HLA risk factors, suggesting masking by HLA associations. A similar phenomenon was 
previously reported for rs2516489, a variant located in an intergenic region within 10 kb of 
DDX39B, which showed association only after adjusting for other HLA risk variants 
(Patsopoulos et al., 2013). The authors proposed Simpson’s paradox as a likely explanation, 
wherein HLA and DDX39B variants are associated independently but the effect of DDX39B 
variants is likely masked by the effects of HLA variants. This masking by HLA variants may 
explain why associations of DDX39B with autoimmune diseases have not been as prominent 
as we would expect. Importantly, we observed dramatic allele-specific variation of DDX39B 
protein levels (up to two-fold) due to rs2523506 genotype among LCLs of African origin, 
and to a lesser extent among LCLs of European origin, which mainly results from an effect 
of rs2523506 on translational efficiency. A perplexing result is the stronger correlation of 
rs2523506 genotype with DDX39B protein levels in African than in European LCLs. While 
a complete explanation of this finding is not yet at hand, the data indicate that regulation of 
DDX39B levels is likely complex, and other genetic or epigenetic modifiers could titer 
DDX39B expression or activity. Nonetheless, it is remarkable that the correlation between 
DDX39B protein levels and rs2523506 genotype was observed by two distinct experimental 
methods, namely western blot (this work) and mass spectrometry (Wu et al., 2013), and in 
two populations of LCLs (YRI/ESN and IBS).
A critical finding in this study is the epistatic interaction between rs2523506 in DDX39B 
and rs6897932 in IL7R. This interaction was missed in a recent study that investigated 
potential polygenic interactions in MS between HLA risk alleles and established non-HLA 
MS risk variants, including IL7R, because non-HLA risk variants within the MHC, such as 
rs2516489 and rs2523506, were not interrogated (International Multiple Sclerosis Genetics 
et al., 2015). It has been long thought that functional polymorphisms affecting genes within 
the same gene network could enhance disease risk in complex genetic disorders but this has 
been difficult to prove. For instance, several studies have reported suggestive evidence for 
genetic interactions in several autoimmune diseases including Systemic Lupus 
Erythematosus (Zhou et al., 2012), Rheumatoid Arthritis (Briggs et al., 2010; Perdigones et 
al., 2010) and MS (Shahbazi et al., 2011). Nonetheless, all these cases lack functional 
validation and understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms. Here, we report 
strong evidence for epistasis between DDX39B rs2523506 and IL7R rs6897932, which 
confers higher susceptibility to MS in a dose-dependent manner. More importantly, we 
functionally demonstrated that the risk alleles at both loci work in concert to increase

 skipping of IL7R exon 6, thereby enhancing the biogenesis of sIL7R. This study represents a 
rare example where the molecular underpinnings of a pathogenic epistatic interaction are 
understood and have been functionally validated.
Lastly, our studies uncovered a protective role for DDX39B in the pathogenesis of MS, 
wherein decreased DDX39B expression results in up-regulation of sIL7R via skipping of 
IL7R exon 6. Although our multidisciplinary study centers on MS, other genetic studies 
have suggested associations of variants within DDX39B with other autoimmune diseases 
including Rheumatoid Arthritis (Kilding et al., 2004; Okamoto et al., 2003; Quinones-
Lombrana et al., 2008), Type 1 Diabetes (Barrett et al., 2009; Cheong et al., 2001; Price et 
al., 2004; Wong et al., 2003) and Atopic Dermatitis (Paternoster et al., 2012); therefore, it is 
likely that DDX39B play a similar protective role in these diseases. This is supported by 
findings of elevated plasma levels of sIL7R in patients of Rheumatoid Arthritis (Badot et al., 
2011), Type 1 Diabetes (Monti et al., 2013), and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (Lauwerys 
et al., 2014). In addition, DDX39B has also been proposed to negatively regulate production 
of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNFa, IL1, and IL6 (Allcock et al., 2001). Collectively, these 
data imply that DDX39B may play a larger role than previously appreciated in the regulation 
of immune function and in the development of autoimmunity.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Cell lines and culture conditions—HeLa and Jurkat T cells were obtained from the 
Duke University Cell Culture Facility. This facility provides authenticated cell lines free of 
mycoplasma contamination. HeLa Flp-In T-Rex cell line (Kaiser et al., 2008) was kindly 
provided by Dr. E Dobrikova (Duke University). LCLs were obtained from the Coriell 
Institute Cell Repositories. HeLa cells were grown in DMEM medium (Life Technologies), 
whereas Jurkat T cells and LCLs were grown in Advanced 1640 RPMI medium (Life 
Technologies); both medium were supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS (Gemini 
Bio-Products) and 1% antibiotics (Pen Strep; Life Technologies).
Primary human CD4+ T cells collection and culture—Informed consent was 
obtained from healthy volunteers for blood donation. Collection of blood samples was in 
accordance with the research protocol entitled “Characterizing human immune response 
signatures that predict clinical outcomes by isolating PBMCs, serum and plasma from 
normal donors which will be used for optimization, validation and serve as normal controls 
for immune profiling assays” (Protocol ID: Pro00070584, Kent Weinhold, PI) approved by 
the Institution Review Board at Duke University. Peripheral blood mononucleated cells 
(PBMCs) were extracted from whole blood using the Ficoll method and CD4+ T cells were 
further isolated using CD4+ T cell isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec). Isolated primary CD4+ T 
cells were cultured in Advanced 1640 RPMI medium supplemented with 20% heat-

 inactivated FBS, 1% antibiotics and 100 ng/mL human recombinant IL-2 (Peprotech). 48 
hours prior transduction, CD4+ T cells were activated with anti-CD3 (50 ng/mL; 
eBioscience) and anti-CD28 (100 ng/mL; BD Biosciences) antibodies in the media.
DNA and RNA collection from human PBMC and LCL—Informed consent was 
obtained from RRMS patients and healthy volunteers enrolled in the MURDOCK-MS study. 
Blood samples were drawn from these individuals for DNA and RNA isolation. Sample 
collection was in accordance with the research protocol associated with this study as 
approved by the Institution Review Board at Duke University. Genomic DNA and total RNA 
were isolated from whole blood using the QIAamp DNA Blood mini kit (QIAGEN) and 
PAXgene Blood RNA kit (QIAGEN), respectively. We point out that although these RNA 
samples were isolated from whole blood, throughout the text we referred to them as isolated 
from PBMCs, given that the majority of nucleated cells in whole blood are PBMCs. 
Additional samples from individuals enrolled at Duke University were isolated from PBMCs 
using Trizol reagent. For LCLs, total RNA was harvested using the ReliaPrep RNA Cell 
Miniprep System (Promega). All RNA samples were treated with TURBO DNase (Ambion) 
according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
METHOD DETAILS
Generation of stable cell line expressing DDX39B—HeLa cells stably expressing an 
inducible DDX39B cDNA trans-gene were generated using the Flp-In T-Rex system (Life 
Technologies) as recommended by the manufacturer. HeLa Flp-In T-Rex cell line (Kaiser et 
al., 2008) was kindly provided to our group by Dr. E Dobrikova (Duke University). The 
coding sequence of DDX39B was amplified with Phusion High-Fidelity DNA polymerase 
(New England BioLabs) using as template cDNA prepared from total RNA isolated from 
human PBMCs. Forward and reverse primers contained HindIII and XhoI restriction sites, 
respectively. The resulting PCR amplicon was cloned into pcDNA5/FRT/TO plasmid using 
HindIII and XhoI restriction sites and verified by Sanger sequencing. This plasmid was co-
transfected with pOG44 plasmid, which encodes the Flp recombinase, into HeLa Flp-In T-
Rex cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s 
instructions. Transfected cells were grown in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS 
free of tetracycline (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) under blasticidin/hygromycinB selection 
for 15 days, and resistant cells were expanded and used for subsequent experiments. 
Expression of the trans-gene was induced by addition of tetracycline at 50 μg/ml.
Genotyping of human primary cells and LCLs—DNA samples from human PBMCs 
and primary CD4+ T cells were genotyped for DDX39B rs2523506 and IL7R rs6897932 
using TaqMan genotyping assays (Applied Biosystems) or by sequencing. LCLs were 
previously genotyped in the HapMap project (International HapMap, 2003, 2005; 
International HapMap et al., 2007).
Transfection of IL7R splicing reporters—IL7R reporter minigenes, previously 
described in (Gregory et al., 2007), consisted of the genomic region of IL7R encompassing 
614 bp of intron 5, exon 6 and 573 bp of intron 6, cloned in between constitutive upstream 
(U) and downstream (D) exons in the pI-11 plasmid. Three versions of the IL7R reporter

 minigene were used containing the alternative alleles of rs6897932 (C or T) or mutation of 
ESE2 in the context of the risk C allele (ΔESE2). These IL7R splicing reporters (25 ng per 
well in 24-well format) were transfected into HeLa cells or Jurkat T cells using 
Lipofectamine 2000 or FuGENE 6 (Roche), respectively, according to the manufacturer’s 
recommendations. Total RNA was harvested 48 hours after transfection using Trizol 
Reagent (Life Technologies). Exon 6 skipping was determined for each reporter by RT-PCR 
as delineated below.
DDX39B RNAi-mediated knockdown and rescue—siRNA duplexes against 
DDX39B were purchased from Qiagen (DDX_3 = Hs_BAT1_11; DDX_4 = Hs_BAT1_13) 
and diluted to a final concentration of 10 pM upon arrival. Two independent siRNAs were 
used to account for potential off-target effects. AllStars Negative Control siRNA (Qiagen) 
was used as negative control in all knockdown experiments. Transfections were performed 
in biological triplicates for each siRNA. 24 hours prior to siRNA transfection, 5 × 104 HeLa 
cells were seeded in 500 pL of DMEM medium per well in 24-well plate format. siRNAs 
were diluted in Opti-MEM I medium (Life Technologies) and transfected at final 
concentration of 50 nM on days 1 and 3 post-seeding using Lipofectamine RNAiMax (Life 
Technologies), following the manufacturer’s recommendations. On day 5 post-seeding, the 
cells were transfected with 25 ng of the corresponding IL7R reporter minigene using 
Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies) under the manufacturer’s recommendations. Two 
versions of the IL7R reporter minigene were used containing the alternative alleles of 
rs6897932 (IL7R-C and IL7R-T): for the experiments in Figure 1 we used the IL7R-C 
reporter, whereas for the experiments in Figure 5 we used both IL7R-C and IL7R-T 
reporters. On day 7, cells were harvested with Trizol Reagent (Life Technologies) or 
ReliaPrep RNA Cell Miniprep System (Promega) for RNA isolation, or with 1X RIPA buffer 
for protein extraction. DDX39B depletion was determined by western blotting as delineated 
below. Percentage IL7R exon 6 skipping was determined by RT-PCR (see section RT-PCR 
analysis of IL7R splicing). Knockdown experiments were performed three times with 
similar results.
For the rescue experiment in Figures 1 and S3, HeLa cells stably expressing a DDX39B 
cDNA trans-gene, either wild type (wt) or a helicase mutant (D199A, previously 
characterized in (Shen et al., 2008; Shen et al., 2007)), were grown in the absence or the 
presence of tetracycline to control expression of the trans-gene. Cells were transfected with 
the corresponding siRNAs on days 1, 3 and 5 post-seeding. For this experiment we used 
DDX39B siRNA DDX_4 because it targets the 3′ UTR of the endogenous DDX39B 
transcripts, which is not present in transcripts from the cDNA trans-genes. Cells were 
harvested on day 9 with the ReliaPrep RNA Cell Miniprep System (Promega) for RNA 
isolation or with 1X RIPA buffer for western blot analysis. These experiments were 
performed at least two times with similar results. For the experiment with IL7R-ΔESE2 
splicing reporter, this reporter was transfected into cells on day 7 and cells were harvested 
on day 9 as above.
In both knockdown and rescue experiments the relative level of DDX39B protein was 
verified by western blotting. Total protein was harvested using 1X RIPA buffer (150 mM 
NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and 50 mM Tris-HCl at pH 7.5)

 freshly supplemented with 1X protease inhibitors (Roche). 10 μg of total protein were 
loaded per lane on NuPAGE 4%–12% Bis-Tris pre-cast gels (Life Technologies), transferred 
to nitrocellulose membranes (Whatman), and blotted using standard protocols with anti-
DDX39B rabbit polyclonal antibody (Abcam, ab47955) and anti-hnRNPA1 mouse 
monoclonal antibody (Abcam, ab5832) as loading control.
RNAi-mediated knockdown of other genes products—Knockdown of RNA 
helicases DDX5, DDX17 and DDX23, and of genes in the vicinity of the DDX39B locus 
(MICB, NFKBIL1, LTA and TNF) were performed in HeLa cells with at least two 
independent siRNAs and the non-silencing control siRNA (NSC). Three additional genes in 
this region (MCCD1, ATP6V1G2 and LTB) are not expressed in HeLa cells and thus were 
not tested. siRNA transfections were carried out as before but at a final siRNA concentration 
of 30 nM. Cells were harvested on day 5 post-seeding for RNA isolation using the ReliaPrep 
RNA Cell Miniprep System. Knockdown levels were quantified by RT-qPCR and 
normalized to GAPDH as detailed below. IL7R exon 6 skipping was determined by RT-PCR 
as delineated below. These experiments were performed once in biological triplicates.
Lentiviral packaging—DDX39B shRNA pLKO.1 vector (sh3 = TRCN0000286976; sh5 
= TRCN0000294383) and the Mission non-targeting control shRNA pLKO.1 vector 
(SHC002) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Lentiviral packaging of these shRNA 
constructs was carried out in 293T cells using Polyethylenimine (PEI) method. In brief, 7.5 
× 106 cells were seeded in 15-cm dishes in DMEM media supplemented with 10% FBS and 
1% antibiotics 24 hours prior transfection (3 15-cm dishes per construct). Cells were co-
transfected with 17 μg of the corresponding shRNA pLKO.1 vectors or GFP control vector 
(pLCE), 17 μg of packaging plasmid (pCMVR8.74) and 7 μg of VSV-G envelope plasmid 
(pMD2.G) in serum-free media and 120 μg PEI. DNA-PEI mixes were added drop-wise to 
the corresponding dishes and 18 hours after the medium was replaced with 20 mL fresh 
DMEM media. After 72 hours, supernatants were collected, filtered through 0.45 μm filters 
and concentrated to 6 mL in Amicon Ultra 100K centrifugal filter units (EMD Millipore). 
Concentrated lentiviral particles were stored at 4°C overnight.
Transduction of primary human CD4+ T cells—Primary CD4+ T cells from 6 
different donors were transduced following modifications to the method in (Bilal et al., 
2015). In brief, 4.0 × 106 activated primary CD4+ T cells from each donor were transduced 
with 1 mL of the corresponding concentrated lentivirus in the presence of 8 μg/mL 
hexadimethrine bromide (Sigma-Aldrich) at a final density of 1.0 × 106 cells/mL in RPMI 
media supplemented with 20% FBS, 1% antibiotics and 100 ng/mL recombinant human 
IL-2. Transductions were carried out for 72 hours, followed by antibiotic selection with 
puromycin (1.5 μg/mL) for 96 hours. Prior to the start of puromycin selection, GFP-
transduced cells were assayed for GFP expression by flow cytometry. Cells were transduced 
at 50–60% efficiency as determined by % GFP positive cells, and were enriched to >90% by 
puromycin selection. 24 hours prior to collection, cells were resuspended in RPMI media 
without puromycin and IL-2 for analysis. Supernatants were collected for quantification of 
sIL7R secretion, and cells were harvested for RNA isolation with the ReliaPrep RNA Cell 
Miniprep System (Promega) or for protein extraction with 1X RIPA buffer as before.

 Knockdown of DDX39B was determined by western blotting as before, and by RT-qPCR 
with normalization to GAPDH. IL7R exon 6 skipping and sIL7R secretion were quantified 
by RT-PCR and ELISA, respectively, as described below.
RT-PCR analyses of IL7R splicing—Total RNA was harvested using either Trizol 
Reagent (Life Technologies) or the ReliaPrep RNA Cell Miniprep System (Promega) 
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Isolated RNAs were treated with TURBO 
DNase (Ambion) or DNase I (Promega) to degrade contaminating DNA following the 
company’s recommendations. 0.2–1.0 μg of DNase-treated total RNA was used as template 
for reverse transcription using either the ImProm-II Reverse Transcription System (Promega) 
or the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription System (Applied Biosystems) and 
random hexamer primers. PCR reactions were prepared as follows: 5 μL of the 
corresponding RT reaction (diluted 1:5) was mixed with 200 nM of forward and reverse 
primers (see below), 100 nM dNTPs, 50 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.3 μL of Taq polymerase, 
and [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol, 10 mCi/mL, PerkinElmer) at a final concentration of 0.1 
μCi/μL. PCR primers for minigene constructs (IL7R-C, IL7R-T and IL7R-ΔESE2) were 
complementary to T7 (forward) and SP6 (reverse) promoter sequences present in the 
construct, respectively (Gregory et al., 2007). PCR primers for endogenous IL7R were 
complementary to exon 5 (forward) and exon 7 (reverse). PCR products were 
electrophoresed on 6% non-denaturing polyacrylamide/TBE gels, dried in a gel drier and 
exposed to a Molecular Dynamics Phosphorimager screen. Quantifications were performed 
using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). Percentage exon 6 skipping was 
determined as: [(skipped product)/(included + skipped products) × 100]. The data are 
presented as the mean of triplicate samples and error bars represent standard deviations. 
Statistical significance in knockdown and rescue experiments was assessed using Student’s 
t-test (two-sided).
Quantification of sIL7R by ELISA—Supernatants from the DDX39B knockdown 
experiments in HeLa cells and primary CD4+ T cells described above were collected and 
concentrated to 100 μl by centrifugation in Amicon Ultra 3K centrifugal filters (Millipore, 
UFC500324). Secreted sIL7R was quantified from the concentrated supernatants by ELISA 
as in (Crawley et al., 2010). In brief, 96-wells plate (R&D Systems, DY990) were coated at 
4°C overnight with a mouse anti-human IL7R monoclonal antibody (R&D Systems, 
MAB306). The next day, the plates were blocked with 3% BSA in PBS for one hour (room 
temp), followed by two-hour incubation (room temp) with the concentrated supernatants, 
and four washes with PBS-Tween (0.05%). Detection of bound sIL7R was carried out by 
one-hour incubation (room temp) with biotinylated goat anti-human IL7R polyclonal 
antibody (R&D Systems, BAF306), followed by 30-minute incubation (room temp) with 
streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (Millipore, #18-152), and 20-minute incubation (room 
temp) with TMB peroxidase substrate (SurModics BioFX, TMBW-1000-01), with four 
washes with PBS-Tween (0.05%) between manipulations. The reaction was stopped with 1N 
H2SO4, and the product was visualized in a plate reader at 450 nm. The concentration of 
samples was extrapolated from standard curves of recombinant human IL7R-Fc chimera 
(R&D Systems, 306-IR-050). Given that knockdown of DDX39B increases skipping of 
IL7R exon 6, we expected secretion of sIL7R to increase in the knockdown. For this reason,

 we used a one-sided Student’s t-test to assess statistical significance, comparing each 
independent siRNA against the negative control (Fig. 1D). This experiment was performed 
twice with similar results.
RT-qPCR expression analyses—Transcript expression analyses in PBMCs and LCLs 
were carried out by RT-qPCR. We used 0.2–0.7 pg of DNase-treated RNA as template for 
reverse transcription using the ImProm-II Reverse Transcription System (Promega) and 
oligo(dT) primers. cDNAs were diluted 1:5 and RT-qPCR reactions were carried out using 
Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), with 5 pL of the corresponding 
cDNA, and 200 nM of the corresponding forward and reverse RT-qPCR primers. The 
relative abundance of the target genes (DDX39B, MICB, MCCD1, ATP6V1G2, NFKBIL1, 
LTA, TNF and LTB) was determined with gene-specific assays spanning an exon junction 
and normalized to GAPDH. The data were stratified by rs2523506 genotypes and 
normalized to rs2523506 CC genotype. Each point in the box plots represents measurements 
in PBMCs or LCLs from one individual and is shown as the average of technical triplicates. 
Statistical significance was established using the Student’s t-test (two-sided).
Overall abundance of IL7R transcripts in rescue experiment and knockdown in primary 
CD4+ T cells was determined by RT-qPCR as before with primers complementary to the 
constitutively spliced exons 3 (forward) and 4 (reverse). IL7R levels were normalized to 
GAPDH, and the data is shown as fold-change over the negative control. Statistical 
significance was established using the Student’s t-test (two-sided).
Global splicing analysis by RNA-seq—Global assessment of alternative splicing 
events regulated by DDX39B was carried out by DDX39B knockdown followed by RNA-
seq. Knockdown was performed as before with DDX39B siRNAs DDX_3 and DDX_4, and 
control siRNA (NSC) in two independent experiments. Poly-A+ RNA was enriched from 1 
pg of total RNA and used as template to generate libraries using the Illumina TruSeq 
platform as recommended by the manufacturer. Libraries were sequenced on a 2 × 100 
format on an Illumina Hi-Seq 1500. Splicing analysis was carried out using Vast-tools 
program version 0.2.1 (Irimia et al., 2014) by aligning the paired-end reads to the vast-tools 
human database (vastdb.hsa.7.3.14) using the default parameters. Two replicates of each 
condition were compared with the diff function of vast-tools to determine differential 
splicing. Two parameters were used to establish differential splicing events: E[ΔPsi], which 
refers to the difference in splicing between the experimental siRNAs (DDX_3 or DDX_4) 
and control siRNA (NSC) (positive and negative values indicate up-regulation and down-
regulation, respectively), and max(x)@P(|ΔPsi|>x)>0.95, which indicates the change in 
splicing at 95% confidence level. To control for off-target effects, we only considered 
changes in splicing with max(x)@P(|ΔPsi|>x)>0.95 ≥ 10.0 with at least one DDX39B 
siRNA but E[ΔPsi] ≥ +/− 20.0 with both DDX39B siRNAs.
DDX39B western blot analyses in LCLs—Cell lysates were harvested from each cell 
line at two independent times using 1X RIPA buffer as before. Each cell lysate (10 μg of 
total protein per lane) was blotted twice, and the values presented correspond to the average 
of the independent measurements. To obtain more accurate measurements of relative protein 
abundance, DDX39B protein levels were normalized to either hnRNPA1 (Fig. 3C) or PTBP1

 (not shown), yielding similar results. DDX39B and hnRNPA1 were blotted as before, 
whereas PTBP1 was blotted using custom-made anti-PTB rabbit serum (Wagner and Garcia-
Blanco, 2002). We used the Student’s t-test (two-sided) to assess statistical significance of 
the findings.
Luciferase translation efficiency assays—Luciferase reporters were generated by 
cloning the different DDX39B 5′ UTR variants into pcDNA5 plasmid containing the coding 
sequence of Renilla luciferase (R-Luc). DDX39B 5′ UTR variants were synthesized as 
gBlocks (Integrated DNA Technologies) and cloned immediately upstream of the R-Luc 
ORF using HindIII (5′) and KpnI (3′) restriction sites. All constructs were verified by 
sequencing. DDX39B 5′ UTR-R-Luc reporters (25 ng/well) were independently co-
transfected with a Firefly luciferase control (F-Luc, 10 ng/well) into HeLa cells in 24-well 
format using Lipofectamine 2000 as indicated by the manufacturer. 24 hours post-
transfection cell lysates were collected for luciferase assays with Passive Lysis Buffer and 
Luciferase assays were immediately performed using the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay 
System (Promega). Total RNA was isolated from independent wells and converted into 
cDNA as above. RNA level for experimental and control reporters was quantified by RT-
qPCR as before using primers complementary to the R-Luc and F-Luc ORFs, respectively. 
Luciferase activity and RNA levels were determined by normalizing R-Luc signals to F-Luc 
signals (R-Luc/F-Luc). Translational efficiency was then determined by dividing normalized 
Luciferase activity by normalized RNA levels. Statistical significance was assessed by 
Student’s t-test (two-sided).
Genetic association and gene-gene interaction analyses—We used genotypic data 
from six genetic cohorts of non-overlapping case and control subjects of European descent, 
imputed to >37.4 million SNPs across the genome using BEAGLE and 1000 Genomes 
Interim Phase I haplotypes using standard procedures (Patsopoulos et al., 2011). We 
analyzed SNPs within 10 kilobases of autosomal candidate genes with ≥ 80% information 
and minor allele frequency > 1% (4882 SNPs in 96 of the 116 candidate genes). 
EIGENSOFT, a principle components algorithm, identified genetic outliers and calculated 
the top 10 eigenvectors of the genotype data within each cohort; the first 5 eigenvectors 
sufficiently accounted for population stratification (Patsopoulos et al., 2011). Each variant 
was analyzed using a meta-analytic logistic regression model as implemented in PLINK 
(Purcell et al., 2007), assuming alleles have an additive effect on the log-odds scale within 
each cohort. Each model included the top 5 principal components. We assumed the genetic 
effects were fixed across all cohorts, as previously performed for these data (Patsopoulos et 
al., 2013; Patsopoulos et al., 2011). One candidate gene (DDX39B) resides within the MHC, 
therefore meta-analyses for this locus were also adjusted for known HLA risk variants 
(HLA-adjusted model, included HLA-DRB1*15:01, HLA-DRB1*03:01, HLA-
DRB1*13:01, HLA-DRB1*04:04, HLA-DRB1*04:01, HLA-DRB1*14:01, HLA-A*02:01, 
rs9277489, HLA-B*37:01, and HLA-B*38:01), and subsequently for an additional non-
HLA MHC risk variant, rs2516489 (MHC-adjusted model). These risk variants within MHC 
region were imputed using BEAGLE (Browning and Browning, 2009; Patsopoulos et al., 
2013) by leveraging a collection of 2,767 individuals of the Type 1 Diabetes Genetics 
Consortium with typed classical HLA alleles as previously described and validated

 (International et al., 2010; Patsopoulos et al., 2013; Raychaudhuri et al., 2012). We used a 
logistic regression model in STATA (StataCorp) to investigate a multiplicative interaction 
between DDX39B rs2523506 and IL7R rs6897932, which was characterized further in IL7R 
rs6897932 and DDX39B rs2523506 stratified analyses. Similar methodology was employed 
to study interaction between HLA-DRB1*15:01 and IL7R rs6897932. The joint genotypic 
effect of rs2523506 and rs6897932 on MS risk was determined by comparing each 
genotypic combination to the reference (non-carriers of risk alleles at both loci). All models 
were adjusted for population stratification, cohort origin and HLA risk variants.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Molecular analyses—Statistical significance of all molecular analyses in this study was 
assessed by Student’s t-test (two-sided; *** p ≤ 0.0005; ** p ≤ 0.005; * p ≤ 0.05). Sample 
sizes for expression analyses in PBMCs and LCLs are indicated in the text and in the legend 
of the corresponding figures. Data on expression analyses in PBMCs and LCLs is shown as 
median with interquartile range, whereas data on knockdown and rescue experiments is 
presented as mean ± s.d. These measurements are indicated in the legend of the 
corresponding figures.
Genetic Association Analyses and gene-gene interaction—Logistic regression 
models were used to examine the relationship between genetic variants and multiple 
sclerosis disease status (binary trait); we report odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals in 
the text. Genome-wide statistical significance was imposed for these meta-analytic models 
(two-sided; p ≤ 5 × 10−8). Models for variants residing within the MHC: having met the 
significance threshold, were subsequently adjusted for all other known MS MHC risk 
variants; statistical significance of p ≤ 0.05 was imposed for these fully parameterized 
models. Similar significance threshold of p ≤ 0.05 was imposed for the interactions between 
IL7R rs6897932 and DDX39B rs2523506, and HLA-DRB1*15:01 and IL7R rs6897932. 
Sample sizes for these analyses are reported in the text.

 Figure 2. Variants within or adjacent to the DDX39B locus strongly associated with MS risk
Each diamond represents a variant analyzed, and the color of the diamonds indicates no 
association (gray), marginal association (yellow) or strong association (red) with MS risk. 
The variant rs2523506 is indicated with a larger diamond (see Figure 3). Black and blue 
dotted lines indicate thresholds for marginal (p ≤ 1.0 × 10−2) and strong (p ≤ 5.0 × 10−8) 
association, respectively. The location of the four genes present in this region of 
chromosome 6 is illustrated at the bottom. See also Figure S5 and Table S3.

 Figure 5. Functional interaction between DDX39B and IL7R exon 6 variants
The interaction between DDX39B and IL7R was functionally tested in DDX39B-depleted 
HeLa cells using IL7R splicing reporters carrying either the risk C allele (IL7R-C; left) or 
the protective T allele (IL7R-T; right) of rs6897932. RT-PCR analysis of exon 6 splicing 
(mean ± s.d.) reveals higher exon 6 skipping when the levels of DDX39B are reduced in the 
context of the risk C allele than of the protective T allele of rs6897932 (Student’s t-test, two-
sided; ** p ≤ 0.005).

 Figure 6. DDX39B regulates IL7R exon 6 splicing in primary CD4+ T cells
Knockdown of DDX39B in primary CD4+ T cells from six donors via lentiviral transduction 
with two independent shRNA against DDX39B (sh3 and sh5) and a non-targeting control 
shRNA (NTC). Donors are grouped by IL7R genotype: IL7R-CC (A) and IL7R-CT (B), and 
each panel illustrates DDX39B western blot analysis (top) and RT-PCR analysis of IL7R 
exon 6 splicing (bottom) for each donor individually. In each panel, the plots on the right 
show the average of % exon 6 skipping for each IL7R genotype (mean ± s.d., Student’s t-
test: ** p ≤ 0.005; * p ≤ 0.05).

Interaction between rs2523506 and rs6897932 and association with MSrisk was investigated using a logistic regression model adjusted for population stratification, cohort origin, and HLA risk variants. The 
interaction model was further investigated using analyses stratified by rs6897932 (top) and rs2523506 (middle) genotypes. The bottom panel shows joint genotypic effect of rs6897932 and rs2523506 on 
MS risk. Bolded is the joint effect in homozygous carriers of the risk allele at both loci. See also Tables S4 and S5.
