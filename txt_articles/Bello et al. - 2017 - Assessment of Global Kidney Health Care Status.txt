IMPORTANCE Kidney disease is a substantial worldwide clinical and public health problem,
but information about available care is limited.
OBJECTIVE To collect information on the current state of readiness, capacity, and
competence for the delivery of kidney care across countries and regions of the world.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Questionnaire survey administered from May to
September 2016 by the International Society of Nephrology (ISN) to 130 ISN-affiliated
countries with sampling of key stakeholders (national nephrology society leadership, policy
makers, and patient organization representatives) identified by the country and regional
nephrology leadership through the ISN.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Core areas of country capacity and response
for kidney care.
RESULTS Responses were received from 125 of 130 countries (96%), including 289 of 337
individuals (85.8%, with a median of 2 respondents [interquartile range, 1-3]), representing
an estimated 93% (6.8 billion) of the world’
s population of 7.3 billion. There was wide
variation in country readiness, capacity, and response in terms of service delivery, financing,
workforce, information systems, and leadership and governance. Overall, 119 (95%), 95
(76%), and 94 (75%) countries had facilities for hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, and kidney
transplantation, respectively. In contrast, 33 (94%), 16 (45%), and 12 (34%) countries in
Africa had facilities for hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, and kidney transplantation,
respectively. For chronic kidney disease (CKD) monitoring in primary care, serum creatinine
with estimated glomerular filtration rate and proteinuria measurements were reported as
always available in only 21 (18%) and 9 (8%) countries, respectively. Hemodialysis, peritoneal
dialysis, and transplantation services were funded publicly and free at the point of care
delivery in 50 (42%), 48 (51%), and 46 (49%) countries, respectively. The number of
nephrologists was variable and was low (<10 per million population) in Africa, the Middle East,
South Asia, and Oceania and South East Asia (OSEA) regions. Health information system
(renal registry) availability was limited, particularly for acute kidney injury (8 countries [7%])
and nondialysis CKD (9 countries [8%]). International acute kidney injury and CKD guidelines
were reportedly accessible in 52 (45%) and 62 (52%) countries, respectively. There was
relatively low capacity for clinical studies in developing nations.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This survey demonstrated significant interregional and
intraregional variability in the current capacity for kidney care across the world, including
important gaps in services and workforce. Assuming the responses accurately reflect the
status of kidney care in the respondent countries, the findings may be useful to inform efforts
to improve the quality of kidney care worldwide.

K
idney disease is a substantial worldwide clinical and
public health problem.1-3 Acute kidney injury (AKI)
and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are linked to high
health care costs, poor quality of life, and serious adverse
health outcomes (including cardiovascular disease, kidney
failure requiring kidney replacement therapy, infection,
depression, and mortality).3-7 However, despite the burden
and population health effect of kidney diseases, AKI and CKD
are often not included in the major chronic disease control
strategies. As an example, the World Health Organization’
s
(WHO’
s) Global Status Report on Noncommunicable Diseases
20148 makes almost no mention of kidney disease. This pre-
sents an obstacle for engaging with various governments in
addressing AKI and CKD.
The Closing the Gaps initiative is led by the Interna-
tional Society of Nephrology (ISN) and aims to define the
current state of kidney care (for AKI and CKD) worldwide,
including policy recommendations for improvement. As
part of this initiative, a global survey, the Global Kidney
Health Atlas (GKHA) Project, was conducted to collect in-
formation on the current state of readiness, capacity, and
competence for the delivery of kidney health care in each
country and region.
Methods
Design and Participants
The GKHA Project was a multinational survey conducted by
the ISN to assess current capacity for kidney care across the
world. The survey was administered electronically to indi-
viduals in 130 countries with ISN affiliate societies through
the ISN’
s 10 regional boards (Africa, Central and Eastern
Europe, Latin America, Middle East, North America, North
and East Asia, Oceania and South East Asia [OSEA], newly
independent states and Russia, South Asia, and Western
Europe). The project was approved by the University of
Alberta Research Ethics Committee (protocol number
PRO00063121). All individual participants provided written
informed consent.
Purposive sampling was undertaken to include at least 3
key stakeholders per country (national nephrology society
leadership, health policy makers, and patient organization/
foundation/advocacy representatives), each of whom was
identified as being knowledgeable about their country’
s kid-
ney care status and nominated by the country and regional
nephrology leadership through the ISN. In some cases, coun-
try stakeholders had a dual role (eg, both nephrology leader
and policy maker) or particular stakeholders (eg, consumer
organization representative) were unable to be identified,
such that some countries were represented by fewer than 3
key stakeholders. The key representatives were sent a letter
of invitation to participate that included a link to the survey’
s
online portal (an electronic questionnaire via SurveyMonkey
[https://www.surveymonkey.com/]). Respondents were
asked specifically about important within-country heteroge-
neity on kidney care funding and delivery and to identify
other potential key respondents, increasing the likelihood
that relevant information would be widely captured. The sur-
vey was conducted from May to September 2016. During this
period, follow-up was conducted by email and telephone to
ISN regional leaders and country leadership to facilitate
completion and timely responses. During the survey period,
each survey respondent who had not yet returned their sur-
vey received a personalized email reminder every 2 to 3
weeks up to a maximum of 3 attempts.
Development and Validation of Survey Instrument
The design of the GKHA questionnaire was meant to col-
lect information about nations’capacities and responses
about noncommunicable disease prevention and control.
The survey development process considered a number of
documents, including WHO’
s Universal Health Coverage:
Supporting Country Needs, the ISN’
s AKI “0 by 25” project,
WHO Noncommunicable Disease Surveys (2000, 2005, 2010,
and 2013), the World Heart Federation’
s “25 by 25” goal, the
International Diabetes Federation’
s Global Diabetes Atlas,
and WHO’
s Global Atlas on Cardiovascular Disease Preven-
tion and Control, as well as multiple United Nations policy
documents on strategies, and policies for noncommuni-
cable diseases.9-14 The initial survey questions were further
developed through a series of reviews with relevant experts,
the ISN Executive Committee, and regional leaderships.
The questionnaire was reviewed by the GKHA steering
committee (scientific experts) and ISN regional leaders for
content validity and comprehensiveness. The questionnaire
was piloted across the 10 ISN regional board memberships
to identify any logistical and feasibility issues (eg, need for
translation). The format and content of the questionnaire
(eAppendix 1 in the Supplement) were finalized based on
feedback and identified issues, including translating the
original English-language survey instrument into French
and Spanish by certified translators. The French and Span-
ish surveys were checked by relevant regional boards and
were back-translated into English.
The questionnaire was designed in 2 sections that
addressed the core areas of country and regional capacity
for kidney care delivery. The first section comprised 6 mod-
ules assessing country and regional profile for readiness,
Key Points
Question What is the status of kidney health care across
the world?
Findings In a survey of 125 (96%) of 130 International Society of
Nephrology–affiliated countries (representing an estimated 93%
of the world’
s population) with a response rate of 85.8% (289 of
337 individuals surveyed), the findings identified major variation in
reported service delivery, funding mechanisms for kidney
replacement therapy, and available technologies, such as facilities
for kidney disease detection and management (eg, serum
creatinine and proteinuria assessments).
Meaning These findings on the status of global kidney care may
inform efforts by governmental and nongovernmental groups to
improve the quality of kidney care worldwide.

capacity, and response to CKD and AKI premised on the 6
health system building blocks (access to essential medicines
and technologies, health systems financing, health service
delivery, health workforce, health information systems, and
leadership and governance).15 The second section contained
questions that assessed response of the nephrology com-
munity (including care guidelines, position papers, service
frameworks, and advocacy initiatives) and capacity for
research and development.
Data Handling, Analysis, and Reporting
To facilitate data collation, responses to the French and
Spanish surveys were first converted to English by certified
translators. Data from all individual questionnaires were
subsequently automatically extracted and checked for
inconsistencies, missing data, duplications, and formatting
errors. The data were then merged into a single file to create
the global database. This was housed in a secured central-
ized computer system with automated backups.
Liaison with ISN regional leaders was undertaken to
ensure that collated data were consistent with their under-
standing and were of high quality. Each of 10 regional
boards reviewed their output to clarify any ambiguity or
inconsistencies. Any major inconsistencies that remained
following the reviews were systematically addressed
by follow-up of individuals who responded to the survey.

Further validation was carried out at country and regional
levels by triangulation of the findings with published litera-
ture and other sources of information (government reports
and other sources provided by the survey respondents). For
example, among the responses for New Zealand, 2 indicated
that there was an official registry for dialysis and transplan-
tation, whereas 1 indicated that there was not an official reg-
istry. The existence of a New Zealand dialysis registry was
subsequently confirmed by cross-checking with the OSEA
Regional Board and the Australian and New Zealand Dialysis
and Transplant Registry (http://www.anzdata.org.au/).
Similarly, 2 Kenyan respondents indicated that there was
a nephrology training program in Kenya, whereas 1 respondent
said there was not a nephrology training program but also
indicated only moderate certainty of the answer. Telephone
discussion with the African Regional Board confirmed that
a nephrology training program did exist in Kenya.
The framework developed by WHO (Assessing National
Capacity for the Prevention and Control of Noncommuni-
cable Diseases) was leveraged in the approach to the statisti-
cal analysis of the collated data.16 The analysis was con-
ducted using Stata version 13 software (Stata Corp). The unit
of analysis was responding country, and results were strati-
fied by ISN region (n = 10) and World Bank country classifica-
tion (n = 4) as low-, lower middle–, upper middle–, and high-
income nations. Responses were summarized based on the
key questionnaire domains using a descriptive statistical
approach and reported as counts and percentages or medians
and interquartile ranges, as appropriate. Nonquantitative
data (text response items of the questionnaire) were themati-
cally analyzed using a standard approach.17 The results were
examined with an emphasis on identification of key gaps
and challenges across the various domains based on the pre-
existing protocol and reported according to the Guidelines
for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting
(GATHER) statement.18
Results
Response Rate
Responses were received from 125 (96%) of 130 countries,
including 289 (85.8%) of 337 individuals (median of 2
respondents per country [interquartile range, 1-3]) repre-
senting an estimated 93% (6.8 billion) of the world’
s popula-
tion of 7.3 billion (Table 1). Responses were received from
100% (18/18), 97% (34/35), 91% (32/35), and 98% (40/41) of
low-income, lower middle–income, upper middle–income,
and high-income countries, respectively (Table 1). The
respondent countries were representative of the countries
in each region by population size (Table 1). The survey
respondents consisted of nephrologists (247 [85%]), other
physicians (10 [3%]), administrators/policy makers
(16 [6%]), and others (16 [6%]) affiliated with kidney disease
patient advocacy (Table 2).
Country Readiness, Capacity, and Response to CKD and AKI
Access to Essential Medicines and Technologies
There were variations across ISN regions (n = 10) and World
Bank income groups (n = 4) in the prevalence of treated
end-stage renal disease represented by kidney replacement
therapy (kidney replacement therapy: hemodialysis, perito-
neal dialysis, and kidney transplantation), with the highest
prevalence in developed regions in comparison with devel-
oping nations (Figure 1). The reported availability and
access to essential medicines for CKD care and technologies
also showed significant variations across regions and coun-
tries (eAppendix 2 in the Supplement). Among all countries
(n=125 responding), 119 (95%), 95 (76%), and 94 (75%) had
facilities for hemodialysis, long-term peritoneal dialysis,
and kidney transplantation, respectively; 100% of high-
income countries had such facilities. In contrast, 33 (94%),
16 (45%), and 12 (34%) countries in Africa had facilities for
hemodialysis, long-term peritoneal dialysis, and kidney
transplantation, respectively (eAppendix 2).
Health Systems Financing
The number of countries (n=118 responding) that reported
complete public funding (completely free care at the point
of delivery covered by the government) for chronic hemodi-
alysis, long-term peritoneal dialysis, and kidney trans-
plantation were 50 (42%), 48 (51%), and 46 (49%), respec-
tively (Table 3). Overall, 45 (39%) and 34 (49%) countries
reported complete public funding for hemodialysis and
peritoneal dialysis, respectively, in the acute setting
(Table 4). The public funding structures for all forms of

kidney replacement therapy (hemodialysis, peritoneal
dialysis, and kidney transplantation) were less common in
the low- and lower middle–income countries (Table 3 and
Table 4). There was significant variation across regions in
access to medications for kidney care. For instance, no
country from the low-income and lower middle–income cat-
egories reported complete public funding for medications
for nondialysis CKD care (including angiotensin-converting
enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, other
antihypertensive agents, statins, and glucose-lowering
agents) (Table 5 and eAppendix 2 in the Supplement). In
contrast, 12 (32%) and 10 (32%) high- and upper middle–
income nations reported complete public funding for medi-
cations in nondialysis CKD care (Table 5).
Health Service Delivery
Globally, infrastructure available for kidney care was re-
ported to be good/above average in 48 (39%) and excellent in
11 (9%) countries for AKI. For CKD, 46 (38%) countries were
rated good/above average and 9 (7%) were rated excellent

(eTable 1 in the Supplement). Reports of extremely poor or
poor/below average infrastructure for AKI and CKD care were
highest in Africa and South Asia and lowest in Western Europe
and North America (eTable 1). Pertaining to services used for
monitoring CKD, measurement of serum creatinine reported
with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was de-
scribed as always or usually available at the primary and sec-
ondary care levels in only 21 (18%) or 23 (19%) and 43 (40%)
or 25 (23%) countries, respectively (Table 6, Table 7, and eAp-
pendix 3 in the Supplement). Pathological services for renal
biopsy were always available at the secondary care level for
27 (23%) countries but were otherwise rarely or never avail-
able in 28 (24%) and 16 (14%) countries, respectively (Table 7
and eAppendix 3).
Health Workforce
Respondents from countries were asked to provide esti-
mates of the number of trained nephrologists, as defined by
the relevant regulatory authorities, and provide an opinion
regarding shortage (yes/no) of the workforce required for
kidney care delivery. There was a low reported nephrology
workforce density (≤10 per 1 million population) for several
countries in the Africa, North and East Asia, and South Asia
regions as well as in parts of Latin America (Figure 2). There
were also wide disparities in the number of nephrologists
across countries and regions. For instance, 9 of the 10 coun-
tries with the lowest numbers of nephrologists were in sub-
Saharan Africa (eFigure 1A in the Supplement), whereas the
countries with the highest number of nephrologists were
from several regions, with Lithuania, Taiwan, and Japan
reporting the highest numbers of nephrologists per 1 million
population (eFigure 1B in the Supplement). Overall, there
were frequent reported shortages of the various categories
of other health care workers. Most countries had reported
shortages of vascular access coordinators, transplant coordi-
nators, social workers, renal pathologists, nurse practition-
ers, nephrologists, dieticians, dialysis technicians, dialysis
nurses, and counselors and psychologists (Figure 2C).
In contrast, fewer countries reported shortages of pharma-
cists, laboratory technicians, and primary care physicians
(Figure 2C). By region, shortages of other health care clini-
cians were more common in Africa, the Middle East,
Latin America, South Asia, North and East Asia, OSEA, and
East and Central Europe (eTable 2 in the Supplement). For
example, 28 (85%) countries in Africa had reported short-
ages of nephrologists compared with only 2 (20%) countries
in Western Europe with reported shortages of this category
of workforce (eTable 2).
Health Information Systems
Countries were asked to provide data on the availability of
registries (surveillance and monitoring systems) for kidney
replacement therapy and nondialysis CKD and AKI. The
prevalence of treated end-stage renal disease was compara-
tively low in some regions compared with others (Figure 1).
For instance, Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia had
low prevalence of treated end-stage renal disease in com-
parison with North America and Western Europe (where the
prevalence was generally above 1000 per 1 million popula-
tion) (Figure 1). Overall, only 9 (7.7%) and 8 (6.8%) countries
reported having registries for nondialysis CKD and AKI,
respectively (eFigure 2 and eAppendix 3 in the Supple-
ment). There was wide variation in the presence of kidney
replacement therapy registries across regions, with most
countries reporting having dialysis registries and fewer
reporting having kidney transplant registries, particularly in
Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia (eFigure 2 and eAp-
pendix 3). Dialysis and kidney transplant registries were
most commonly available in Western Europe, North and
East Asia, North America, and East and Central European
countries (eFigure 2 and eAppendix 3).
Leadership and Governance
Specific national strategies for improving the care of
patients with CKD were reported as present in only 19 coun-
tries (17%) (eTable 3 in the Supplement). There were varia-
tions in the availability of 1 or more of the various strategies
(national position paper, identification tools, incentives,
etc) for improving identification of AKI across regions;
59 countries (51%) had none of these strategies (eTable 4 in
the Supplement).
Response of the Nephrology Community
(Guidelines and Advocacy for Kidney Care)
The majority of countries reported access predominantly to
international guidelines compared with national guidelines.

Access to international CKD and AKI management guide-
lines was reported in 60 (52%) and 52 (45%) countries,
respectively (eTable 5 in the Supplement). Thirty-one coun-
tries (27%) reported availability of national guidelines for
CKD (eTable 5). In contrast, only 8 countries (7%) reported
access to national guidelines for AKI. Presence of CKD and
AKI advocacy groups were limited in most regions and were
more common for CKD than for AKI (eFigure 3 and eAppen-
dix 3 in the Supplement).
Capacity for Research and Development
Respondents rated their involvement with different phases
of clinical trials and observational research studies (avail-
able infrastructure, trained workforce, ethical frameworks,
etc). Low capacity for participation in different aspects of
clinical trials was frequently reported, especially in devel-
oping countries and regions (eAppendix 3 in the Supple-
ment). For example, only 33 (28%) and 46 (40%) countries
overall could participate in phase 1 and phase 2 clinical
trials, respectively (eTable 6 and eAppendix 3 in the Supple-
ment). Western Europe and North America reported the
highest capacity to participate in all phases of clinical trials
(eTable 6 and eAppendix 3). For instance, all countries in
these 2 regions reported capacity to participate in phase 3
and 4 trials in contrast to only 5 (17%) and 4 (13%) in Africa,
respectively (eTable 6). Although most countries described
some capacity to conduct or participate in observational
cohort studies, Africa and Middle East countries reported no
capacity to participate in transplantation cohort studies
(eTable 6). Institutional ethics approval was the most com-
mon study approval type in most countries overall and
across most regions (eTable 6).
Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first systematic assessment of
the global capacity for kidney care in terms of the key build-
ing blocks of a functional health system and readiness of
countries and regions to enhance such care. There were sig-
nificant gaps reported in services, facilities, and workforce
in some countries and regions. Most countries in Africa
described no facilities for peritoneal dialysis or kidney
transplantation. Few countries reported complete public
funding for kidney replacement therapy services and medi-
cations for CKD care (including dialysis and transplanta-
tion); there was a large private contribution toward payment
for kidney replacement therapy services and medications
reported particularly in countries across the Africa, South
Asia, and OSEA regions. Even though the infrastructure
available for AKI and CKD care was mostly rated as average
or above average, survey responses suggested that measure-
ment of serum creatinine with eGFR was common at the
primary care level in only a few countries. Availability of
pathological services for kidney biopsy was described as
very low. Overall, there was a reported shortage of nephrol-
ogy workforce and other workforce categories in many set-
tings. There was limited availability of health information
systems (renal registries), particularly for nondialysis CKD
and AKI. National or regional strategies for improving CKD

and AKI care were present in only a few countries, with
wide variations across regions on the reported availability
and access to care guidelines. The presence of CKD and AKI
advocacy groups was reported as limited in most regions
and was more common for AKI than for CKD, with more
than two-thirds of countries reporting absence of capacity
to participate in clinical research.
The status of kidney health care as suggested by this
study indicates that the health systems of many countries
face substantial challenges in closing the large gaps that are
reported to currently exist in meeting the health needs of
people with AKI and CKD around the world.1,19 First, the
reported limited availability of and public funding for AKI
and CKD care (kidney replacement therapy technologies,
essential medicines, service delivery and infrastructures,
kidney disease detection), particularly in low- and lower
middle–income countries, call for strategies at global,
regional, and national levels to make these care components
accessible and affordable to the burgeoning populace with
kidney disease.20-23 While community-based kidney disease
prevention, identification, and treatment programs repre-
sent an important low-cost strategy with the potential
for significant public health benefits,24,25 the present
study found that most countries reported inadequate
CKD detection and surveillance systems to achieve this
goal. For example, the ability to quantitatively measure
serum creatinine with eGFR reporting and proteinuria even
at secondary care levels was “always” possible in only 7
(21%) and 2 (6%) African countries, respectively. Further-
more, peritoneal dialysis tended to be relatively underuti-
lized in resource-poor countries, even though this mode is
generally considered a less expensive and technically less
demanding form of kidney replacement therapy26 that
is particularly suited to low- and lower–middle income
countries challenged by limited finances, limited nephrol-
ogy workforce, and geographical barriers.21 Developing low-
cost kidney disease detection programs (integrated with
other noncommunicable disease strategies) and low-cost
dialysis programs in resource-limited settings requires
building partnerships among industry, international health
agencies, and governments,22 as occurred with the estab-
lishment of low-cost chronic disease management programs
in Africa.22,27-29
A second challenge is the limited availability of re-
liable surveillance systems reported for both AKI and CKD
across countries and regions, which is a major impediment
to designing and implementing effective interventions to
close the identified gaps in infrastructures and services.30
Policy decisions at national and international levels
are required to support development of functional informa-
tion systems across the broad spectrum of kidney diseases
and to track and monitor burden, treatment, and related
outcomes.29,30
A third key challenge is the limited workforce capacity
reported in most countries and regions, especially dialysis
nurses, laboratory workers, dietitians, transplant coordina-
tors, and nephrologists. Because health care workforce avail-
ability is a prerequisite for effective AKI and CKD manage-
ment programs and policies,29 the challenge of health care
professional shortages will require a concerted response from
major national and international stakeholders.11,27
Fourth, the limited capacity reported in most regions
and countries to undertake clinical research calls for more
investment and a targeted research agenda to improve
understanding of kidney disease burden, process of care,
outcomes monitoring, and testing of novel interventions,
particularly in low- and lower middle–income countries.27
The key strengths of the GKHA Project were the de-
velopment of the study protocol and survey instrument,
which followed a well-validated conceptual framework

assessing capacity for other chronic diseases based on the
widely applied WHO health system building blocks.15
The survey had high external validity, involving 125 coun-
tries and including very good coverage across regions and
income levels. Data were reviewed for accuracy and validity
by regional and national stakeholders knowledgeable of the
local context across regions and countries. Furthermore,
the findings were corroborated and validated via triangula-
tion with secondary data sources based on a review of
published and other literature at country levels (provided
by survey respondents and other sources). In addition,
a future survey using similar methods may provide assess-
ments of improvements or declines in global kidney health
care status.
The GKHA Project and this study also have several limi-
tations. The use of a questionnaire survey, although an
important source of information, was potentially subjective
and highly dependent on the knowledge, expertise, and
perceptions of the respondents. Furthermore, there are no
internationally agreed on or recommended benchmarks for
health care workforce densities, and therefore, precise defi-
nition of what constitutes a health worker shortage is likely

to vary considerably between different countries. The sur-
vey questions were limited to only face validity and were
reliant on respondents answering fairly and representing
the status of services in their country accurately. To address
these potential problems, respondents with a range of kid-
ney care knowledge, expertise, and regional representation
were carefully selected in liaison with the ISN regional
boards. There was potential for social desirability bias to
have influenced some responses, which was mitigated by
corroborating findings with regional leaders as well as sec-
ondary data sources. The study also did not take into
account some important dimensions of health systems,
such as quality, efficiency, accessibility, geographic distribu-
tion, and within-country heterogeneity (particularly
between urban and rural regions).
Conclusions
This survey demonstrated significant interregional and
intraregional variability in the current capacity for kidney
care across the world, including important gaps in services
and workforce. Assuming the responses accurately reflect
the status of kidney care in the respondent countries, these
findings may be useful to inform efforts to improve the
quality of kidney care worldwide.
