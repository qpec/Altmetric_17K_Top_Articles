Oncology Guidelines Usage in a Low- and 
Middle-Income Country
INTRODUCTION
Clinical decisions that determine outcomes, 
quality of life, and survival rate are made on a 
daily basis in low- and middle-income coun-
tries (LMICs). Thus, there is a need to stream-
line the decision-making process with a set of 
instructions that offers guidance on how to man-
age a particular clinical scenario. This can be 
achieved by using clinical treatment guidelines 
also known as practicing evidence-based med-
icine. Treatment guidelines are used across all 
fields of medicine to ensure quality care, stan-
dardized care, and cost control. The Institute 
of Medicine defines clinical practice guidelines 
as “. . . statements that include recommenda-
tions intended to optimize patient care that are 
informed by a systematic review of evidence 
and an assessment of the benefits and harms of 
alternative care options.”1 These guidelines have 
been established to improve patient care.1 The 
Guidelines International Network currently con-
tains more than 6,400 guidelines from 85 coun-
tries.2 Most of these guidelines are created by 
reputable guideline development organizations 
that are based in developed countries. These 
treatment guidelines are used globally by health 
care providers; however, the use of guidelines 
by health care providers varies according to the 
region, available facilities, patient demographics, 
 
health care funding, disease presentation, health 
care personnel, and expertise in providing health 
care.
Cancer is the leading cause of death world-
wide, accounting for approximately 8.2 million 
deaths in 2012.3 In the developed world, cancer 
is regarded as a preventable and often curable 
disease. Unfortunately, in many LMICs, the mor-
tality and morbidity rates are unacceptably high, 
making cancer a death sentence.4 There is a 
growing cancer crisis in the developing world.3,5 
Purpose There is a paucity of data about current usage of oncology guidelines in low- and middle- 
income countries (LMICs), specifically in terms of the availability and quality of those guidelines. 
Our objective was to determine usage of oncology guidelines and the barriers and facilitators to 
their usage among radiation oncologists in LMICs.
Methods An online cross-sectional survey was conducted among practicing radiation oncologists 
in Nigeria via e-mail and the social media database of the Association of Radiation and Clinical 
Oncologists of Nigeria. In addition, paper questionnaires were administered at regional clinical 
meetings.
Results The survey response rate was 53.4% in a sample of 101 radiation oncologists from the 
database. Sixty-nine percent of respondents were consultants and 30% were residents. Approx-
imately 43% had < 5 years’ experience. All of the respondents were involved in administering 
chemotherapy during the treatment of patients with cancer, whereas approximately half were 
involved in diagnosing cancer. Ninety-three percent reported using guidelines in treating patients, 
the top two guidelines being those from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (90%) and 
the American Society of Clinical Oncology (50%). The two major barriers to guideline usage were 
that facilities were inadequate for proper guideline implementation and that the information in 
guidelines were too complex to understand. Potential facilitators included providing adequate 
facilities, developing local guidelines, and increasing awareness of guideline usage.
Conclusion Our study shows that clinicians involved in the treatment of patients with cancer in 
LMICs are aware of cancer treatment guidelines. However, implementation of these guidelines 
hinders their usage because the facilities are inadequate, guidelines are not applicable to the 
local setting, and the information in the guidelines is too complex.

 Annually, more than 60% of the world’s total new 
cases occur in developing countries, specifically 
in parts of Africa, Asia, Central America, and 
South America.5 It is estimated that nearly 15 mil-
lion people will have a high probability of being 
diagnosed with cancer in the year 2015, with the 
majority occurring in developing countries.5,6 This 
rapid increase has been associated with increas-
ing life expectancy, changing lifestyles, and unhy-
gienic living conditions.3,6 For example, Nigeria, 
which is categorized as an LMIC, is experiencing 
an increasing incidence of cancer cases.7 The 
most common cancers in Nigeria are cancer of 
the prostate and liver in men and cancer of the 
breast and cervix in women.7
Across Nigeria, there is currently a shortage of 
cancer specialists, such as surgeons, radiation 
oncologists, and medical oncologists—the phy-
sicians who recommend, prescribe, and admin-
ister chemotherapy—with less than five medical 
oncologists and approximately 100 radiation 
oncologists (consultants and residents in train-
ing) in the country.8 The majority of radiation 
oncologists are practicing in radiotherapy cen-
ters and are trained in the administration of che-
motherapy.8 These radiation oncologists spend a 
significant portion of their training and practice 
prescribing and administering chemotherapy and 
managing adverse effects.
In addition, patients are treated on the basis of 
access to resources at the institution that pro-
vides their care. Resources include the availability 
of cancer specialists with various levels of exper-
tise in administering chemotherapy, availability of 
anticancer agents, the cost of chemotherapy, and 
the availability of supportive care, which may lead 
to wide disparity in how patients are treated. An 
overview of the disparities in availability, usage, 
quality, and barriers to implementation of cancer 
treatment guidelines in Nigeria has not been stud-
ied. Hence, this national, cross-sectional survey 
was conducted to provide an overview of the use 
of cancer treatment guidelines among radiation 
oncologists in Nigeria.
The primary objective of this study was to mea-
sure the level of use of cancer treatment guide-
lines among health care providers in Nigeria 
who are involved in the treatment of patients 
with cancer. The secondary objectives were to 
identify potential barriers to the use of cancer 
treatment guidelines, and potential facilitators of 
their use.
METHODS
This study was implemented in two phases. In 
the first phase, reported here, we focused on 
radiation oncologists. The second phase would 
be an expansion study to include other health 
care providers involved in managing patients 
with cancer in Nigeria.
Study Design
The study used a cross-sectional, prospective 
survey conducted between December 2016 and 
February 2017. The survey examined the use of 
cancer treatment guidelines to identify potential 
barriers to and facilitators for their use.
Sample Population
The Association of Radiation and Clinical Oncol-
ogists of Nigeria (ARCON) database was used to 
capture the population of radiation oncologists 
in Nigeria. The ARCON database has approxi-
mately 100 radiation oncologists spread across 
10 states in Nigeria, which ensured that different 
parts of the country would be represented in the 
collected data.
Survey Tool
We used a self-reported questionnaire that con-
sisted of three main sections and required approxi-
mately 5 to 7 minutes to complete. The first section 
included data on guideline usage and demo-
graphic characteristics such as the participant’s 
name, institutional affiliation and location, number 
of years in practice, area of specialization, guideline 
usage, and specific guidelines used. The second 
section consisted of a self-reported 19-item scale, 
which was adapted from the validated barriers to 
research utilization scale (BARRIERS) developed 
by Funk et al9 in 1991. Respondents were asked to 
rate each item on what they perceived to be barriers 
 
to using cancer treatment guidelines in their prac-
tices on a 5-point Likert scale from 1 (strongly dis-
agree) to 5 (strongly agree). The third section, in 
an open comment format, was structured to elicit 
responses on the top three potential facilitators to 
usage of cancer treatment guidelines.
Ethical Consideration
Ethical approval was received from the ethics com-
mittee of the Lagos University Teaching Hospital.

 the study was included with the invitations to com-
plete the online questionnaire sent via e-mail, or 
via postage for paper copies. The completion of the 
questionnaire, online or in person for paper ver-
sions, was taken to imply consent to participate in 
the study. All data received from the questionnaire 
were kept confidential and were accessed only by 
the researchers. All participants in the study were 
assured that their participation was voluntary.
Data Collection
Survey data were collected electronically using 
 
the Survey Monkey platform and also by in- 
person administration of paper surveys at meet-
ings. An e-mail to request the completion of the 
questionnaire was sent to those in the ARCON 
e-mail database. The questionnaire was sent as 
a Web link (via Survey Monkey) and as a Word 
(Microsoft, Redmond, WA) attachment. In addi-
tion, the questionnaire was also distributed at 
two oncology conferences that targeted radiation 
oncologists in Nigeria. Reminders were sent via 
e-mail and by telephone on weeks 1 and 3 after 
the first e-mail invitation.
Data Analysis
All data collected electronically and on paper were 
entered manually into the Survey Monkey online 
database. Individual and summary data were 
then downloaded into an Excel file (Microsoft, 
Redmond, WA) and were numerically coded for 
quantitative analysis. Descriptive statistics such 
as frequency mean and standard deviation were 
used to describe the basic demographic charac-
teristics of the respondents and to summarize the 
modified BARRIERS scores. Data collected on 
potential facilitators was coded and analyzed.
RESULTS
Demographic Characteristics of Respondents
A total of 54 radiation oncologists completed the 
survey questionnaires, yielding a response rate 
of 53.4%. A summary of the demographic char-
acteristics of all respondents is listed in Table 1. 
A majority of the respondents (68.5%) were con-
sultants, and residents made up approximately 
30%. The percentage of respondents who had 
< 5 years of experience or between 5 and 10 
years of experience was 42.6% and 40.7%, 
respectively. Only 17% had more than 10 years 
of experience managing patients with cancer.
Experience Treating Patients With Cancer
Almost all of the radiation oncologists reported 
being involved in the radiotherapy (98%) and 
chemotherapy (100%) administration phase of 
treating patients, followed by involvement in sup-
portive care (92.6%), diagnosis (61.1%), and 
screening (51.8%). When asked if they used can-
cer treatment guidelines or any specific standard 
treatment protocol in treating patients in their 
respective practices, 92.6% said, “Yes” and 7.4% 
said, “No.” Figure 1 shows the details of specific 
guidelines that were being used. The top three 
guidelines were from the National Comprehensive 
Cancer Network (NCCN; 90%), American Society 
of Clinical Oncology (ASCO; 50%), and the Euro-
pean Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO; 46%).
Perceived Barriers to Guideline Usage
The top three major barriers identified were 
inadequate facilities for properly implementing 
guidelines, guideline information that was too 
complex or overwhelming, and guidelines that 
were not applicable to the setting with average 
ratings of 2.88, 2.57, and 2.47, respectively. 
The barriers that ranked lowest were guidelines 
that were not readily available, physicians being 
unaware of the guidelines, and the guidelines 
not being relevant to the physician’s practice. 
The 19 barriers discussed in the questionnaire 
along with their ratings are listed in Table 2.
Potential Facilitators of Guideline Usage
Data for this section were collected in an open 
comment format. Eight themes emerged from 
the qualitative analysis and were coded accord-
ingly. The frequency of response for each theme

 is shown in Figure 2. The top three facilita-
tors were providing adequate facilities (22%), 
increasing awareness of the use of guidelines 
(20%), and developing local guidelines (16%). 
Reducing the patient:physician ratio and simpli-
fying guidelines had the least support.
DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this was the first ever study 
conducted among radiation oncologists in Nige-
ria to examine guideline usage and possible 
barriers to and facilitators of their usage. One 
of the limitations of this study was the average 
response rate of the survey. The response rate 
was partly a result of the fact that the survey was 
mostly available online, and most physicians 
were either too busy to complete the survey or 
had limited access to the Internet. This average 
response rate may also be a result of clinicians 
not being familiar with the guidelines; thus, they 
were unable to comment on guideline usage. 
We made an attempt to improve coverage and 
response by administering some hard copies of 
the questionnaires at two conferences; however, 
this covered only a small percentage of the study 
population. A similar study was conducted by 
Kerr et al10 in 11 LMICs, although they focused 
mainly on guidelines for breast and lung cancer. 
They reported having 139 survey respondents, 
but they have not yet published the full details of 
the outcome of their study.10
Regarding the usage rate for cancer treatment 
guidelines, this study showed that almost all of 
the radiation oncologists sampled used some 
form of guideline document when treating their 
patients. A majority used guidelines developed by 
NCCN, followed by ASCO and ESMO. However,

 approximately half the respondents also reported 
 
that they obtained guidance from other non- 
guideline resources (eg, textbooks, manuals, or 
hospital protocols). This study reported findings 
similar to those of Kerr et al,10 who reported that 
92% of their respondents used NCCN, 55% used 
ASCO, 55% used ESMO, and 40% used national 
guidelines. Despite the high rate of usage of these 
guidelines, several barriers were reported regarding 
their proper usage or implementation, the largest of 
which was inadequate facilities (eg, lack of radi-
ation machines, infusion centers, oncology clin-
ics, and a stable electric power supply). Because 
the current guidelines were created in developed 
countries where clinical data and resources are 
readily available, implementing some of the rec-
ommendations was a major challenge in a setting 
that has suboptimal infrastructure and resources. 
However, several of the organizations that develop 
guidelines have started working toward providing 
guidance for clinicians who work in a limited- 
resource setting. For example, international orga-
nizations such as the WHO, International Agency 
for Research on Cancer, ASCO, NCCN, and Breast 
Health Global Initiative (BHGI) have ongoing pro-
grams that provide cancer treatment guidelines 
based on resource availability. For example, BHGI 
 
and NCCN have developed several resource- 
stratified guidelines, and in 2016, ASCO issued 
 
its first resource-stratified treatment guidelines 
for managing invasive cervical cancer.11
Implementing international guidelines in the 
African setting is challenging, and often, it is not 
feasible to use the guidelines for making clinical 
decisions. In Nigeria, several cancer specialists and 
local organizations continue to explore the develop-
ment of locally relevant guidelines or the modifi-
cation of international guidelines to suit the limited 
health care resource setting and diverse pattern 
of patient presentation. To address this issue, in 
2006, the Federal Ministry of Health created a 
national chemotherapy committee that developed 
a chemotherapy guideline as part of the National 
Cancer Control Plan. However, after the guideline 
was disseminated, it was not widely implemented 
in the clinical setting. Recently, the first edition of a 
breast cancer pocket guideline was developed by 
a charity in collaboration with the Federal Ministery 
of Health. It was launched in March 2017 and is 
currently being disseminated.12
The number one barrier reported in the survey 
was also the number one facilitator. Hence, if 
resources were made available to improve facil-
ities and provide more efficient infrastructures, 
implementation of these guidelines would be 
smoother and less challenging.
In summary, despite the inherent bias that comes 
with a self-reporting survey, the data generated 
from this study provide evidence that can be 
used to guide the development of future locally 
relevant cancer treatment guidelines that factor in 
existing resources and constraints and address 
how they can be optimally applied to improve 
cancer treatment outcomes.
