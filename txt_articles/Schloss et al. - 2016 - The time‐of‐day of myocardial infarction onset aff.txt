Abstract
Myocardial infarction (MI) is the leading cause of death in Western
countries. Epidemiological studies show acute MI to be more preva-
lent in the morning and to be associated with a poorer outcome in
terms of mortality and recovery. The mechanisms behind this asso-
ciation are not fully understood. Here, we report that circadian
oscillations of neutrophil recruitment to the heart determine
infarct size, healing, and cardiac function after MI. Preferential
cardiac neutrophil recruitment during the active phase (Zeitgeber
time, ZT13) was paralleled by enhanced myeloid progenitor produc-
tion, increased circulating numbers of CXCR2hi neutrophils as well
as upregulated cardiac adhesion molecule and chemokine expres-
sion. MI at ZT13 resulted in significantly higher cardiac neutrophil
infiltration compared to ZT5, which was inhibited by CXCR2 antago-
nism or neutrophil-specific CXCR2 knockout. Limiting exaggerated
neutrophilic inflammation at this time point significantly reduced
the infarct size and improved cardiac function.

Introduction
The incidence of cardiovascular events, such as MI, ischemic stroke,
and arrhythmias, exhibits time-of-day dependency in humans, peak-
ing around the sleep-to-wake transition period (Muller et al, 1987a,b;
Chen & Yang, 2015). The underlying mechanisms for this time-of-day
dependency are thought to involve circadian fluctuations of glucocor-
ticoids and catecholamines, blood pressure, heart rate, blood viscos-
ity, and platelet reactivity, thereby predisposing for plaque rupture
and thrombus formation (Tofler et al, 1987; Chen & Yang, 2015). In
addition to the increased prevalence of MI in the morning, experimen-
tal and clinical evidence suggests that the outcome after MI exhibits a
similar time-of-day dependency. A circadian variation of infarct size
has first been described in a mouse model of ischemia/reperfusion,
showing significantly larger infarct size, fibrosis, and adverse remod-
eling after ischemia onset at the sleep-to-wake transition period
(Durgan et al, 2010). Likewise, several clinical studies reported a
correlation between infarct size assessed by peak creatine kinase and
the time-of-day of ischemia onset (Suarez-Barrientos et al, 2011;
Fournier et al, 2012; Reiter et al, 2012).
In recent years, circadian oscillations of immune cell functions
and circulating mediators (e.g. hematopoietic stem cells, glucocorti-
coids) have emerged (Scheiermann et al, 2013). Circulating leuko-
cytes oscillate between blood and peripheral tissue, peaking in mice
at ZT5 (where ZT0 refers to lights on and ZT12 to lights off) in the
blood and at ZT13 in muscle tissue and bone marrow (Scheiermann
et al, 2012). In humans, which have an opposing sleep–wake cycle,
blood neutrophils oscillate throughout the day with an amplitude of
0.31 109/l and a high point around 8:30 pm (Sennels et al, 2011).
These fluctuations in immune cell trafficking into tissues coincide
with sensitivity to acute inflammatory stimuli, being highest at the
beginning of the active phase (Scheiermann et al, 2013). Whether
these oscillations in immune cell activity occur in the heart after an
infarction and which consequences this would have on myocardial
healing is unknown.
High numbers of circulating neutrophils are generally considered
detrimental for post-MI outcome (Kyne et al, 2000; Chia et al,
2009). Neutrophils massively infiltrate the ischemic myocardium
within the first 24 h post-MI, especially when reopening of the

 occluded coronary artery is achieved (Frangogiannis, 2012). Deplet-
ing neutrophils during the reperfusion phase limited acute tissue
injury in experimental models (Romson et al, 1983; Litt et al, 1989).
Nevertheless, despite their detrimental role during the acute post-
ischemic inflammatory role, a limited number of neutrophils might
be important for coordinated resolution of post-MI inflammation
and repair (Frangogiannis, 2012). This is supported by our own
recent findings that neutrophil depletion in a mouse model of
permanent LAD occlusion negatively affects cardiac healing after MI
(when induced during the acrophase of neutrophils in the blood,
ZT5; Horckmans et al, 2016).
In the present study, we raised the question whether the magni-
tude of neutrophil-driven inflammatory response and quality of the
healing response in a murine MI scenario is influenced by circadian
oscillations of neutrophil recruitment to the heart. We found that
the migration of neutrophils to the heart preferentially occurs during
the active phase (ZT13). MI at this time point resulted in signifi-
cantly higher cardiac neutrophil infiltration, in a CXCR2-dependent
manner. Consequently, an ischemic event occurring during the
active phase resulted in an exaggerated neutrophilic inflammation
and worsened cardiac repair. Limiting neutrophil counts at this time
point reduced the infarct size and improved cardiac function. Our
findings suggest that the time-of-day of ischemia onset is a critical
determinant when considering anti-inflammatory treatments for
improving MI outcome.
Results
Circadian oscillations of neutrophils in the mouse heart under
steady state
We first investigated whether a rhythmic recruitment of neutrophils
to the cardiac muscle occurs, as previously reported for skeletal
muscle (Scheiermann et al, 2012). The analysis of blood counts in
resting WT mice confirmed a peak of blood granulocyte counts at ZT5
and lowest levels around ZT13 (Fig 1A). The flow cytometric analysis
of digested hearts revealed more than twofold higher neutrophil
counts in the myocardium at ZT13 compared to ZT5 (Fig 1B). We also
performed immunohistological staining which revealed the presence
of a limited number of neutrophils in the healthy myocardium, with
markedly more cells at ZT13 compared to ZT5 (Fig 1C). In support of
enhanced adhesion and subsequent extravasation of neutrophils into
the cardiac tissue, cardiac ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 adhesion molecule
mRNA expression increased during the active phase (ZT13-17;
Fig 1D), which was paralleled by enhanced mRNA levels of chemoki-
nes mediating neutrophil chemotaxis, that is, CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL5,
CCL3, and CCL5 (Fig 1D). Analysis of the corresponding chemokine
receptor for CXCL1, CXCL2, and CXCL5 on circulating and cardiac
neutrophils, CXCR2, revealed an increased expression level in both
compartments at ZT13 (Fig 1E).
Increased cardiac neutrophil infiltration after MI during active
phase is associated with enhanced myelopoiesis and
neutrophil mobilization
We next investigated whether onset of MI during the peak of cardiac
neutrophil counts would lead to increased neutrophil recruitment.
Indeed, mice subjected to LAD occlusion at ZT13 had higher neutro-
phil counts in the heart 12–24 h post-MI compared to ZT5 infarcts
(Fig 2A). Of note, 12 h post-MI induced at ZT13 is the time point
when oscillating neutrophil counts in tissues are lowest under
steady-state condition. Neutrophils were mobilized from the bone
marrow, resulting in a significant decrease in neutrophil counts in
femurs 12–24 h post-MI, which was much more dramatic in ZT13-
infarcted mice (Fig 2B). In line with enhanced cardiac infiltration
after ZT13 MI, blood counts of granulocytes tended to be lower in
mice with ZT13 MI compared to ZT5 MI (12–24 h post-MI), albeit
the differences were not significant (Fig 2C). To confirm the rele-
vance of circadian time and light for the reported effects on cardiac
neutrophil recruitment, we entrained mice to an inverted light cycle.
Under these conditions, we found a similar increase in cardiac
neutrophil recruitment and enhanced bone marrow mobilization
24 h after ZT13 MI compared to ZT5 MI (Fig 2D).
To better understand the mechanisms of neutrophil mobilization,
we further assessed progenitor numbers in the bone marrow. We
found higher baseline granulocyte–monocyte progenitor (GMP)
counts in the bone marrow at ZT13 compared to ZT5, which were
even higher 24 h after MI (Fig 2E). In agreement with published
data (Mendez-Ferrer et al, 2008), bone marrow levels of the reten-
tion signal CXCL12 decreased from ZT5 to ZT13; however, there
was no further reduction in the bone marrow of ZT13-operated mice
(Fig 2F). We therefore reasoned that enhanced neutrophil mobiliza-
tion after MI at ZT13 might be triggered by enhanced circulating
levels of neutrophil chemoattractants. We found a remarkable
upregulation of TNF-a, CXCL1, CXCL2, CCL3, CCL5, and G-CSF
levels in the plasma of ZT13- versus ZT5-operated mice 24 h post-
MI (Fig 2G). Of note, no difference in chemokine and cytokine
plasma levels between ZT5 and ZT13 was found without infarction,
and there was no induction of CXCL5 plasma levels after MI.
MI during active phase leads to larger infarcts and reduced
cardiac function
In support of the concept that exaggerated neutrophil presence in
ZT13-infarcted hearts results in increased cardiac damage, mice
subjected to LAD occlusion at ZT13 resulted in larger infarcts
compared to mice with ZT5 MI (Fig 3A). The morphometric analysis
was confirmed by elevated plasma levels of troponin I (Fig 3B) and
higher numbers of dead cardiomyocytes after ZT13 MI (Fig 3C). A
similar increase in troponin I levels was observed in infarcted mice
with shifted light cycle (Appendix Fig S1). The mortality rate after
ZT13 MI was significantly higher than after ZT5 MI, with increased
incidence of ventricular rupture in this group (Fig 3D).
In agreement with larger infarcts, ZT13 infarcts had more
myofibroblasts 7 days after MI (Fig 3E and Appendix Fig S2A),
resulting in an increased area of fibrosis (Fig 3F). However, the
anterior wall thickness was significantly reduced in ZT13 infarcts.
More detailed analysis of the collagen composition revealed lower
density of thicker collagen type I fibers in ZT13 infarcts (Fig 3G and
Appendix Fig S2B). Thus, insufficient stabilization of the infarct scar
might contribute to the increased incidence of ventricular rupture
after ZT13 MI. Mice with ZT13 infarcts also had significantly lower
ejection fractions at day 3 to day 14 compared to mice subjected to
MI at ZT5, as well as significant increase in the left ventricular end-
diastolic and end-systolic volume (Fig 3H).

 Reduction in neutrophil-mediated inflammation during active
phase preserves cardiac function after MI
To confirm that the larger infarct size and decreased cardiac
function after ZT13 MI are mainly driven by an exaggerated
neutrophilic
inflammatory
response,
we
investigated
whether
systemic reduction in neutrophils would limit this process. Mice
subjected to MI at ZT13 received neutrophil-depleting Ly6G anti-
body (Fig 4A), resulting in a significant reduction in cardiac
neutrophils (Fig 4B), approximately to the levels observed at
ZT5 reported in Fig 3, and lower plasma levels of pro-inflamma-
tory cytokine TNF-a 24 h after MI (Fig 4C). Mice with ZT13 MI
receiving anti-Ly6G had significantly smaller infarcts and lower
plasma troponin I levels compared to isotype-treated controls,
whereas anti-Ly6G treatment of mice with ZT5 MI had no effect
(Fig 4D). This is in agreement with our recently published data
(Horckmans
et al,
2016).
Moreover,
ZT13
infarcts
of
Ly6G-
treated mice had less fibrosis and thicker left ventricular anterior
wall (Fig 4E) with significantly more collagen type I fibers (Fig 4F),
and
a
higher
ejection
fraction
as
well
as
less
ventricular
dilatation (Fig 4G).
Enhanced cardiac neutrophil recruitment during the active phase
is CXCR2 dependent
To further explore the underlying mechanisms of circadian neutro-
phil recruitment to the myocardium, we focused on CXCR2, as its
expression levels coincided with the peak of neutrophils in the heart
(Fig 1E). There is emerging evidence that circulating neutrophils are
heterogeneous, due to aging and replenishment from the bone
marrow (Casanova-Acebes et al, 2013). Previous in vitro findings
have suggested that aged neutrophils exhibit reduced chemotactic
activity and ability to respond to inflammatory stimuli (Whyte et al,
1993). Similar to the oscillations at baseline, we found significantly
higher percentage of CXCR2hi-expressing neutrophils in the blood of
mice subjected to MI at ZT13 compared to ZT5 MI, with highest
levels 8 h after ZT13 MI (Fig 5A). All cardiac neutrophils were
CXCR2 positive regardless of the time point of LAD occlusion (mea-
sured 12 h post-MI at ZT5 versus ZT13); however, the level of
CXCR2 surface expression was much higher at ZT13 compared to
ZT5 (Fig 5B). In order to clarify the causal relationship between
time-of-day-dependent changes in CXCR2 expression levels on
circulating neutrophils and their recruitment to the ischemic

 first validated the knockdown of CXCR2 on neutrophils (Fig 5F) and
confirmed that increased numbers of CXCR2hi neutrophils at ZT13
were also found in control mice transplanted with wild-type CXCR2
bone marrow, assessed 24 h after MI (Fig 5G). In agreement with
the findings of pharmacological CXCR2 antagonism, neutrophil
CXCR2 deficiency blunted the time-of-day-dependent differences in
cardiac neutrophil counts after ZT5 and ZT13 MI (Fig 5H).
CXCR2 antagonism administered shortly before reperfusion
inhibits exaggerated cardiac neutrophil recruitment at ZT13
Finally, we aimed to validate the effect of CXCR2 blockade in a
clinically more relevant scenario and therefore subjected mice to
transient LAD occlusion (Fig 6A). Similar to the effects observed
in the permanent occlusion model, we found a higher percentage
of CXCR2hi blood neutrophils at ZT13 compared to ZT5, assessed
24 h after reperfusion (Fig 6B). Moreover, vehicle-treated mice
24 h after ZT13 MI had significantly higher neutrophil counts in
the myocardium than ZT5 infarcted mice, as well as enhanced
mobilization from the bone marrow (Fig 6C and D). Administra-
tion of the CXCR2 antagonist after LAD occlusion 5 min before
reopening the vessel prevented excessive neutrophil recruitment
at ZT13 (Fig 6C and D), suggesting a potential clinical benefit for
targeting this receptor.
Discussion
In this study, we provide evidence that the time-of-day determines
the severity of MI damage and outcome. This is due to oscillations
of cardiac neutrophil recruitment regulated by modulation of their
CXCR2 receptor expression levels. Our findings thereby reveal a
potential explanation for the poorer outcomes in subjects with MI in
the early morning hours.
Circadian oscillations of leukocytes between blood and periph-
eral tissue have been previously reported, peaking at ZT5 in the
blood of mice and at ZT13 in skeletal muscle (Scheiermann et al,
2013). As humans have an opposing sleep–wake cycle, the peak of
blood neutrophils is around 8:30 pm (Sennels et al, 2011). Here, we
extended these findings to the murine myocardium: At baseline, we
found twofold higher numbers of neutrophils in the heart at ZT13
compared with ZT5. This is facilitated by enhanced cardiac expres-
sion of adhesion molecules and neutrophil chemoattractants, that is,
CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL5, CCL3, and CCL5 at this time point. Interest-
ingly, the circadian modulation of chemokine expression was only
detectable in the heart, but not systemically, suggesting a local clock
regulating chemokine expression in the myocardium. A similar
mechanism has been recently highlighted by Gibbs et al who identi-
fied a local pulmonary epithelial cell clock controlling neutrophil
recruitment to the lung under inflammatory conditions (Gibbs et al,
2014). Consequently, if an infarct occurs at ZT13, more leukocytes
are present in the heart to respond locally to the ischemic injury by
releasing pro-inflammatory mediators in order to attract more
inflammatory cells into the infarcted area. This might contribute to
the enhanced inflammatory response observed in ZT13 infarcts.
Blood neutrophils follow rhythmic cycles of release and migration
back to the bone marrow, maintained by circadian changes in bone
marrow stromal CXCL12 production and upregulation of CXCR4 by
aged neutrophils for their clearance (Casanova-Acebes et al, 2013).
These aged CXCR4hi neutrophils concomitantly decrease L-selectin
(CD62L) (Casanova-Acebes et al, 2013). Aged neutrophils are
thought to exhibit different migratory and pro-inflammatory pro-
perties (Whyte et al, 1993); however, more recent data reported
enhanced pro-inflammatory activity properties of in vivo aged

 neutrophils (Zhang et al, 2015). In support of reduced migratory
capacity of aged neutrophils, we found a low percentage of circulat-
ing CXCR2hi neutrophils at ZT5 at steady state, when high numbers
of aged CXCR4hi CD62Llo neutrophils are present in the circulation
(Casanova-Acebes et al, 2013). Conversely, circulating neutrophils
at ZT13 MI, the time point with lowest numbers of aged neutrophils
in the blood, were mostly CXCR2hi positive. Similar patterns were
observed after MI. Our blocking and genetic knockout experiments
demonstrated the requirement of CXCR2 for enhanced cardiac
neutrophil recruitment at the beginning of the active phase. Of note,
CXCR2 antagonism or neutrophil-specific knockout did not generally
block neutrophil recruitment at both time points, but only prevented
the accelerated infiltration into the myocardium at ZT13 compared
to ZT5. Accordingly, it was previously described that bone marrow
CXCR2
deficiency
did
not
affect
neutrophil
infiltration
after
ischemia/reperfusion (Liehn et al, 2013). Thus, additional neutrophil
chemoattractants and receptors seem to be involved in cardiac
neutrophil recruitment in a circadian-independent manner, whereas
the CXCR2 ligand/receptor axis follows rhythmic cycles of expression
levels in the myocardium or circulating neutrophils, respectively.
Under homeostatic conditions, we found that GMP numbers
increased in the bone marrow at ZT13, which is in agreement with
previous
findings
revealing
a
rhythmic
modulation
of
the
hematopoietic niche (Smaaland et al, 1992; Mendez-Ferrer et al,
2008). Aged neutrophils return from the circulation back into the
bone marrow and are eliminated, thereby providing a signal for
regulating
the
homeostatic
release
of
their
own
precursors
(Casanova-Acebes et al, 2013).
The retention and release of neutrophils is tightly regulated by
chemokines and their cognate receptors (Kolaczkowska & Kubes,
2013). Bone marrow stromal cells produce CXCL12, which provides
a retention signal for hematopoietic cells expressing high levels of
CXCR4. Circadian reductions in CXCL12 in the bone marrow corre-
late with oscillations of hematopoietic progenitor cells in the circula-
tion (Mendez-Ferrer et al, 2008). G-CSF, which is upregulated after
MI, is known to decrease CXCL12 in the bone marrow in order to
facilitate neutrophil mobilization. Surprisingly, there was no further
decrease in CXCL12 levels after ZT13 MI despite massive upregula-
tion of G-CSF. A possible explanation is that the CXCL12 levels
reach lowest levels at ZT13; thus, no additional decrease in a post-
MI inflammatory situation may occur. Instead, the massive release
of neutrophils from the bone marrow 24h after ZT13 MI might be
explained by the strong increase in chemokine levels in the plasma.
A well-balanced inflammatory response is needed, as dying
cardiomyocytes must be removed by phagocytes and replaced by
fibrous tissue, since mammals cannot regenerate cardiac tissue
(Frangogiannis,
2012).
In
addition to
monocytes/macrophages
(Nahrendorf et al, 2010), a sufficient number of neutrophils is
certainly needed for favorable MI healing (Frangogiannis, 2012). In
support of this hypothesis, we have recently found that neutrophils
improve cardiac healing after MI by influencing macrophage polariza-
tion toward a “reparative” phenotype (Horckmans et al, 2016).
However, an exaggerated neutrophilic inflammation, as observed
after ZT13 MI, generates an environment in which a physiological
and beneficial wound healing is impaired. The consequence is an
insufficient stabilization of the infarct area by collagen fibers,
elevated risk for ventricular rupture and worsening of cardiac
function.
Finally, we may speculate that oscillations of pro-inflammatory
Ly6Chi monocytes (Nguyen et al, 2013) contribute to the enhanced
inflammatory response after ZT13 MI. Indeed, we found elevated
numbers of monocytes in the blood and heart at ZT13 compared to
ZT5 under homeostatic conditions; however, monocyte numbers
significantly increased only 3 days after MI (data not shown). Neutro-
phils represent the predominant innate immune cell population that
massively infiltrate the infarcted myocardium within the first hours,
and we found that limiting neutrophil influx with depleting antibody
was successful to prevent excessive cardiac damage at ZT13.
Our observations in this mouse model have certainly limitations as
permanent coronary ligation does not reflect the predominant situation
in acute MI patients, in which catheter treatment is the gold standard.
Therefore, we repeated a key experiment in the ischemia/reperfusion
model, thereby confirming a potential clinical relevance for targeting
CXCR2 in situations of exaggerated neutrophil infiltration. Our data
may provide an explanation for the worse outcomes found in patients
suffering an acute MI in the early morning hours.
In conclusion, our findings suggest that the time-of-day of ischemia
onset is a critical determinant when considering anti-inflammatory
treatments targeting neutrophils for improving MI outcome.
Materials and Methods
Animal model of myocardial infarction
Adult (8–10 week old) female C57BL/6J wild-type mice (Janvier
Labs, France) were housed for at least 2 weeks under controlled
conditions in a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle with lights on at 7:30 am
(ZT0) and lights off at 7:30 pm (ZT12). Littermates were randomized
and subjected to permanent ligation of the left anterior descending
coronary artery (LAD) at ZT5 (12:30 pm) or ZT13 (8:30 pm). Mice
were
anesthetized
with
midazolam
(5 mg/kg),
medetomidine
(0.5 mg/kg), and fentanyl (0.05 mg/kg), intubated, and ventilated
with a MiniVent mouse ventilator (Harvard Apparatus). A left thora-
cotomy was performed in the 4th left intercostal space, and the peri-
cardium was incised. MI was induced by permanent ligation of the
LAD proximal to its bifurcation from the main stem with monofila-
ment nylon 8-0 sutures (Ethicon, Somerville, USA). The chest wall
and skin were closed with 5-0 nylon sutures (Ethicon). After surgery,
naloxone (1.2 mg/kg), flumazenil (0.5 mg/kg), and atipamezolhy-
drochlorid (2.5 mg/kg) were injected to reverse the effect of anesthe-
sia. Postoperative analgesia (buprenorphine, 0.1 mg/kg) was given
subcutaneously for the first 12 h after surgery. Sham-operated
animals were submitted to the same surgical protocol as described
but without LAD occlusion. For inducing changes in light regime,
mice were placed in a light cycler (Park Bioservices) for a minimum
of 2 weeks to completely establish a 12-h inverted light cycle. Under
these conditions, ZT5 corresponded to 8:30 pm and ZT13 to
12:30 pm. In additional experiments, mice subjected to MI at ZT13
were randomized in two groups to receive monoclonal neutrophil-
depleting antibody (clone 1A8; 50 lg; BioXcell) or isotype by
intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection 30 min after LAD occlusion and then
every 24 h for up to 7 days. In other experiments, mice received i.p.
injection of CXCR2 antagonist SB 225002 (Tocris, 1 mg/kg) or vehi-
cle
5 min
before
LAD
occlusion.

 ischemia followed by 24 h of reperfusion. Five min before reopening
the occluded LAD, mice received an i.p. injection of SB 225002
(1 mg/kg) or vehicle. All animal experimental procedures were
performed in strict accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use
of Laboratory Animals published by the US National Institutes of
Health (NIH publication No. 85-23, revised 1996) and were approved
by the local ethnical committee (District Government of Upper
Bavaria).
Conditional inactivation of CXCR2 in mice and generation of bone
marrow chimeras
We induced homologous recombination in embryonic stem (ES)
cells using a construct containing 4.9 kb of gDNA, including exon 1
and part of intron 1–2, an IRES-LacZ cassette and Neo Cassette were
inserted in between Frt sites, a loxP-site was introduced in 50 direc-
tion to the Neo cassette, and 2.9 kb of gDNA, including CXCR2
exons 2 and 3, was flanked by loxP sites (floxed). The construct
was finished by introducing a 3.5-kb fragment of gDNA serving as 30
recombination arm (Appendix Fig S3). Correctly targeted ES cell
clones were injected into blastocysts to produce a chimeric mouse
that transmitted the modified allele through the germ line. A male
heterozygous for the targeted allele was bred with a female express-
ing ubiquitous Flippase (Flp) transgene to ultimately produce
animals that had deleted the IRES-LacZ and Neo cassettes, preserv-
ing the loxP sites flanking exons 2 and 3. Those homozygous
animals were bred with mice expressing a MRP8-Cre transgene
(Passegue et al, 2004) to ultimately produce animals that had
deleted CXCR2 coding exons into neutrophils.
C57BL/6J wild-type mice (Janvier) underwent lethally whole
body
irradiation
(2 × 5 Gy).
Donor
bone
marrow
cells
were
obtained from Mrp8-CreCXCR2flox or CXCR2flox mice (litermates).
After flushing bones (femur, tibia, humerus), cells were washed, fil-
tered, and intravenously injected (4 × 106 cells/mouse) in sterile
saline into recipient mice 1 day after irradiation. Post-transplantation,
recipient mice were reconstituted for another 6 weeks before under-
going LAD occlusion surgical procedure.
Echocardiography
Transthoracic echocardiography was performed on mildly anes-
thetized spontaneously breathing mice (sedated by inhalation of 1%
isoflurane, 1 l/min oxygen), using a Vevo� 2100 High Resolution
Imaging system equipped with a 40-MHz transducer (VisualSonics,
Toronto, Canada). The mice were placed on a heated ECG platform.
Left parasternal long-axis view and left mid-papillary, apical and
basal short-axis views were acquired. End-diastolic volume, end-
systolic volume, and ejection fraction were evaluated on the left
parasternal long-axis and parasternal short-axis view in a blinded
manner.
Infarct size and cause of death
Hearts were perfused and harvested 24 h after LAD ligation and
sectioned into four equal transverse slices. The slices were incu-
bated in 2% triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) solution (Sigma-
Aldrich) at 37°C for 15 min and fixed overnight in 4% formol at
4°C. For quantification of the area at risk, Evan’s blue was injected
into the left ventricle to distinguish between perfused cardiac tissue
stained blue and non-perfused area at risk 24 h after MI. The area at
risk was calculated as the percentage relative to the left ventricle
(Appendix Fig S4). Images were taken at 10× magnification, and
quantification
of
viable
(red)
and
infarct
areas
(white)
was
performed in a blinded manner with ImageJ software. Each mouse
which died after surgery prior to organ harvest underwent thoracot-
omy to investigate whether there was blood inside the pericardium
indicating cardiac rupture.
Histology
Four-micrometer paraffin sections were stained with Masson’s
trichrome (Sigma-Aldrich). Fibrosis was quantified as the relative
area of blue staining (collagen) compared to the left ventricle
surface, as an average of 3–4 sections per heart at the level of the
papillary muscle, using ImageJ software. The anterior wall thickness
of the left ventricle was measured on Masson’s trichome-stained
sections as an average of 3–4 sections per heart. For Sirius Red stain-
ing of collagen, 3–4 sections per heart were incubated with 0.1%
Sirius Red (Sigma-Aldrich). Sections were photographed with identi-
cal exposure settings under ordinary polychromatic or polarized light
microscopy. Total collagen content was evaluated under polychro-
matic light. Interstitial collagen subtypes were evaluated using polar-
ized light illumination; under this condition, thicker type I collagen
fibers appeared orange or red, whereas thinner type III collagen
fibers were yellow or green. Quantifications were performed with
LAS software (Leica). For quantification of myofibroblasts, sections
were stained with an antibody against smooth muscle actin (aSMA,
clone 1A4 Sigma-Aldrich, dilution 1/300). Myofibroblast density was
quantified using ImageJ software by examining 10 fields per section
at 20× magnification, in a blinded fashion.
Cytokine and chemokine analysis
Blood was harvested by cardiac puncture, and bone marrow super-
natant was obtained by flushing femurs three times with 2 ml of
saline. Troponin I levels were measured with a precoated enzyme-
linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA, Biotrend Chemicals). G-CSF,
CXCL5, and CXCL12 in plasma and bone marrow supernatant were
quantified with ELISA DuoSets from R&D systems. All other
pro-inflammatory markers were quantified with ProcartaPlex
TM
Multiplex Immunoassay (eBioscience).
Blood counter
Freshly obtained EDTA blood harvested by cardiac puncture was
used to analyze leukocyte counts using an animal blood counter
(scil Vet ABC Hematology Analyzer).
Flow cytometry of heart and bone marrow
Hearts were harvested, perfused with saline to remove peripheral
cells, minced with fine scissors, and digested with collagenase I
(450 U/ml), collagenase XI (125 U/ml), hyaluronidase type I-s
(60 U/ml), and DNase (60 U/ml; Sigma-Aldrich and Worthington
Biochemical Corporation) at 37°C for 1 h. Bone marrow cells were
obtained by flushing femurs with 2 ml of saline and triturated

 through 70-lm nylon mesh strainer. The resulting single cell suspen-
sions were centrifuged, resuspended in PBS/BSA 1%, and incubated
with following monoclonal antibodies for 30 min at 4°C at 1/1,000
dilution: anti-CD45.2 (clone 104, BD Biosciences), anti-CD11b (clone
M1/70, BioLegend), anti-c-Kit (clone 2B8, BioLegend), anti-Sca-1

anti-CD34 (clone MEC14.7, BioLegend), anti-Ly6G (clone 1A8, BioLe-
gend), lineage cocktail (clone 17A2/RB6-8C5/RA3-6B2/Ter-119/
M1/70, BioLegend), and isotype controls (BioLegend). Anti-CD182
(CXCR2, PerCP/Cy5.5 labeled, clone TG11/CXCR2, BioLegend) was
used at 1/300 dilution. Viable cells were identified as unstained with
dead cell marker Zombie Yellow
TM (BioLegend) in a 1/100 dilution.
Data were acquired on a FACS Canto II (BD Biosciences), and
analysis was performed with FlowJo software (Ashland, USA).
Neutrophils were identified as CD45+, CD11b+, and Ly6G+; granulo-
cyte–monocyte progenitor cells (GMPs) were identified as lineage�,
Sca-1�, c-kit+, CD16/32+, and CD34+ (Fig 2); and dead cardiomy-
ocytes were identified as Zombie+, CD45�. Gating for CXCR2hi was
performed as shown in Appendix Fig S5.
Quantitative real-time PCR
Whole RNA from lysed hearts (TissueLyser LT, Qiagen) was
extracted (RNeasy mini kit, Qiagen) and reverse-transcribed (Prime-
Script
TM RT reagent kit, Clontech). Real-time PCR was performed
with the 7900HT Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems)
using the KAPA PROBE FAST Universal qPCR kit (Peqlab) and
predesigned primer and probe mix (TaqMan� Gene Expression
Assays, Life Technologies). Messenger RNA expression of markers
of interest was normalized to HPRT, and the fold induction was
calculated by the comparative Ct method.
Statistical analysis
Sample size for in vivo experiments was calculated in order to
provide a statistical power > 85% for an a < 0.05 in detecting a
population effect size > 0.8. Comparisons between two groups of
normally distributed and not connected data were performed using
the unpaired Student’s t-test. Multiple group comparisons were
performed by one-way analyses of variance analyses (ANOVA, for
one independent variable) followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison
tests or two-way ANOVA (for two independent variables) followed
by Bonferroni post hoc test. Mortality was analyzed by log-rank test.
All results are expressed as mean � SEM. P < 0.05 was considered
significant.

Problem
Mounting evidence suggests that the outcome after myocardial
infarction (MI) is time-of-day dependent. This is supported by clinical
studies reporting a correlation between infarct size assessed by
cardiac enzymes and the time-of-day of ischemia onset. The identifi-
cation of underlying mechanisms behind this association might help
developing more specialized therapies to improve prognosis after MI.
Results
We found that the heart represents an immunologically dynamic
organ with circadian fluctuations of adhesion molecule and chemo-
kine expression and recruited leukocytes. We observed that neutrophil
production and retention in the bone marrow are time-of-day depen-
dent and that circulating neutrophils at the beginning of the active
phase have higher capacity to migrate into the myocardium due to
upregulated CXCR2 expression. We conclude that MI onset during the
peak phase of CXCR2hi-expressing blood neutrophils and consequently
cardiac neutrophil accumulation promotes an exaggerated inflamma-
tory response. Reducing neutrophilic inflammation by blocking CXCR2
or partially depleting neutrophils prevents excessive cardiac damage
after MI occurring during the active phase.
Impact
Our findings provide a mechanistic explanation for the worse outcomes
in patients with MI occurring during the sleep-to-wake transition
period. Limiting exaggerated neutrophil-mediated inflammation in
these patients might improve their clinical outcome after MI.
