Fatty Liver Disease—Meta-Analytic
Assessment of Prevalence, Incidence,
and Outcomes

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a major cause of liver disease worldwide. We estimated the global prevalence,
incidence, progression, and outcomes of NAFLD and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). PubMed/MEDLINE were
searched from 1989 to 2015 for terms involving epidemiology and progression of NAFLD. Exclusions included selected
groups (studies that exclusively enrolled morbidly obese or diabetics or pediatric) and no data on alcohol consumption or
other liver diseases. Incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), cirrhosis, overall mortality, and liver-related mortality
were determined. NASH required histological diagnosis. All studies were reviewed by three independent investigators.
Analysis was stratified by region, diagnostic technique, biopsy indication, and study population. We used random-effects
models to provide point estimates (95% confidence interval [CI]) of prevalence, incidence, mortality and incidence rate
ratios, and metaregression with subgroup analysis to account for heterogeneity. Of 729 studies, 86 were included with a
sample size of 8,515,431 from 22 countries. Global prevalence of NAFLD is 25.24% (95% CI: 22.10-28.65) with highest
prevalence in the Middle East and South America and lowest in Africa. Metabolic comorbidities associated with NAFLD
included obesity (51.34%; 95% CI: 41.38-61.20), type 2 diabetes (22.51%; 95% CI: 17.92-27.89), hyperlipidemia (69.16%;
95% CI: 49.91-83.46%), hypertension (39.34%; 95% CI: 33.15-45.88), and metabolic syndrome (42.54%; 95% CI: 30.06-
56.05). Fibrosis progression proportion, and mean annual rate of progression in NASH were 40.76% (95% CI: 34.69-
47.13) and 0.09 (95% CI: 0.06-0.12). HCC incidence among NAFLD patients was 0.44 per 1,000 person-years (range,
0.29-0.66). Liver-specific mortality and overall mortality among NAFLD and NASH were 0.77 per 1,000 (range, 0.33-
1.77) and 11.77 per 1,000 person-years (range, 7.10-19.53) and 15.44 per 1,000 (range, 11.72-20.34) and 25.56 per 1,000
person-years (range, 6.29-103.80). Incidence risk ratios for liver-specific and overall mortality for NAFLD were 1.94
(range, 1.28-2.92) and 1.05 (range, 0.70-1.56). Conclusions: As the global epidemic of obesity fuels metabolic conditions,
the clinical and economic burden of NAFLD will become enormous. (HEPATOLOGY 2016;64:73-84)

onalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is
increasingly recognized as the liver disease
component of metabolic syndrome (MetS).(1)
NAFLD is defined as the presence of �5% of hepatic
steatosis (HS), in the absence of competing liver
disease etiologies, such as chronic viral hepatitis, use of
medications that induce steatosis such as amiodarone or
tamoxifen, and other chronic liver diseases, such as
autoimmune
hepatitis,
hemochromatosis,

MERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR
 disease, or significant alcohol consumption. The U.S.
Guideline for NAFLD (endorsed as the American
Association for the Study of Liver Diseases, American
College of Gastroenterology, and American Gastroen-
terological Association NAFLD Guideline) defines
significant alcohol use as current or recent alcohol con-
sumption of >21 drinks/week in men and >14 drinks/
week in women.(1) Although NAFLD is very com-
mon, a smaller subgroup of these patients can develop
nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which is a more
progressive type of liver disease. NASH is defined his-
tologically by presence of HS with evidence for hepato-
cyte damage.(1) Although some of the pathological
features can be associated with hepatic fibrosis (HF),
the most important histological feature associated with
mortality in NASH is presence of significant fibro-
sis.(2-4) Although this issue still remains controversial,
most of the fibrosis progression seems to occur in
patients with NASH.(5-7) In this context, NASH has
been recognized as one of the leading causes of cirrho-
sis in adults in the United States,(1-11) and NASH-
related cirrhosis is currently the second indication for
liver transplants in the United States.(8,9)
Clinically, NAFLD patients tend to be obese, with
insulin resistance and/or type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia,
hypertriglyceridemia, and hypertension, which are all
risk factors for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs).(10,11)
In fact, prevalence of NAFLD in patients with compo-
nents of MetS is quite high.(12,13) For instance,
NAFLD has been reported in over 76% of type 2 dia-
betics.(14) Furthermore, over 90% of severely obese
patients
undergoing
bariatric
surgery
have
NAFLD.(14-16)
Given
the
common
risk
factors
between NAFLD and CVDs, cardiac-related death is
one of the leading causes of death for NAFLD
patients.(3,17,18)
It is alarming that the prevalence of NAFLD world-
wide is thought to be on the rise. The prevalence of
NAFLD in the United States is reported to be
between 10% and 30%, with similar rates reported
from Europe and Asia.(10,19) The variability of these
rates is compounded by the technology used to estab-
lish the diagnosis of NAFLD and NASH. In order to
better estimate the global burden of NAFLD, it is
imperative to understand its reported incidence, preva-
lence, and disease progression. Therefore, the aim of
this study is to report, through a systematic review
and meta-analytic approach, the worldwide incidence,
prevalence,
disease
progression,
and
burden
of
NAFLD.
Materials and Methods
SEARCH STRATEGY
A search of PubMed and MEDLINE databases
was carried out (1989-2015) to identify English-
language
studies
published
with
information
on
NAFLD prevalence or risk factors for NAFLD
according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Sys-
tematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement for the
conduct of meta-analyses of observational studies
(http://www.prisma-statement.org/). The search terms
included: “fatty liver” AND (“NASH” OR “non-
alcoholic steatohepatitis” OR NAFLD OR non-
alcoholic fatty liver disease OR non-alcoholic) AND
(“incidence” OR “prevalence” OR “risk factors”) AND
(United States OR Europe OR Africa OR Asia OR
South America OR North America OR Middle East
OR Canada). Two readers reviewed the title and
abstract of selected articles for the determination of
inclusion as well as the full text of the selected studies.
Included studies were cross-sectional, longitudinal, or
descriptive studies conducted in adults age 18 or older
and published in peer-reviewed journals published
between 1989 and 2015.

 STUDY EXCLUSION CRITERIA
Exclusion criteria for the meta-analysis were as
follows: (1) The study was a review article or
abstract; (2) the study did not identify patients with
NAFLD; (3) The study was in a pediatric popula-
tion (<18 years old); (4) the study did not exclude
other causes of liver disease, such as viral hepatitis B
and C (HBV/HCV); (5) the study did not report
screening for excess alcohol consumption; (6) the
study included only groups with a specific metabolic
condition, such as morbidly obese and diabetics; (7)
the study was conducted in patients with pre-
existing disease, for example, human immunodefi-
ciency
virus
(HIV)
coinfected;
(8)
the
study
diagnosed NAFLD postmortem; and (9) NASH
studies were excluded if the diagnosis was not made
by histological assessment.
Please note that we did make an exclusion exception
for two studies from Finland where the NAFLD
patients were not screened for viral hepatitis.(20,21)
This exception was granted because of the very low
prevalence of HBV and HCV in the Finnish popula-
tion(20) (see Supporting Fig. 1). For our data collection
methods and statistical analysis, please the Supporting
Information.
NAFLD PREVALENCE
To calculate prevalence, any subgroups of the
screened population with significant alcohol consump-
tion were deducted from the total number of patients
screened. Given that different studies used different
techniques to establish the diagnosis of NAFLD, diag-
nostic techniques were categorized into three groups:
imaging (ultrasound, computed tomography scan and
magnetic
resonance
imaging/spectroscopy);
liver
biopsy; and blood testing (elevated liver enzymes or
fatty liver Index, etc.) For a more accurate calculation
of NAFLD prevalence, only studies that used imaging
to diagnose NAFLD (45 studies) were included in the
main analysis. However, the complete data using all
diagnostic methods is reported in the Supporting Fig-
ures and Tables.
NASH PREVALENCE
Diagnosis of NASH was based on histological fea-
tures of NASH. Studies with NASH prevalence data
were categorized by biopsy indication criteria, which
included: elevated liver enzymes; clinical signs of liver
disease; or retrospection biopsy assessment from terti-
ary care centers. Biopsies without indication were
based on the study design and fell into one of two cate-
gories: A biopsy was either offered to all identified
NAFLD study patients or was offered by random
selection.
NAFLD INCIDENCE,
PROGRESSION, AND OUTCOMES
NAFLD incidence was calculated from a subgroup
of studies that followed healthy nondrinkers without
NAFLD at baseline for development of NAFLD. To
assess NAFLD outcomes of HCC, liver-related mor-
tality, cardiac, mortality, and overall mortality, we
included longitudinal studies of NAFLD or NASH
patients. The definition of HCC included diagnosis of
primary liver cancer. A hazard ratio (HR) for mortality
in NAFLD or NASH was calculated from studies
reporting an adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) with a con-
trol
population
of
healthy
nondrinkers
without
NAFLD at baseline.
Studies that reported repeat liver biopsies were
used for identifying histological progression. We cal-
culated rate of progression (% per year) and % pro-
gressed
for
each
study.
The
rate
of
fibrosis
progression was calculated using studies that assessed
fibrosis stage and repeat biopsies using Brunt’s classi-
fication(5,6) (for references 105-108, see the Support-
ing Information).

 and three in South America), where four were prospec-
tive case series, four were retrospective case series, eight
were case control, 51 were cross-sectional, and 18 were
longitudinal/cohort (Fig. 2)(6,17,20,21,23-30) (for referen-
ces 31-101, see the Supporting Information). A total
of 57 studies reported NAFLD prevalence (Supporting
Table A). The number of studies reporting NAFLD
comorbidities are as follows: obesity, n 5 22; diabetes,
n 5 38; hyperlipidemia/dyslipidemia, n 5 10; hypertri-
glyceridemia, n 5 13; MetS, n 5 22; and hypertension,
n 5 33 (Supporting Table B). Fewer studies reported
NASH prevalence and NASH comorbidities (NASH,
n 5 15; obesity, n 5 4; diabetes, n 5 9; hyperlipidemia/
dyslipidemia,
n 5 3;
hypertriglyceridemia,
n 5 1;
MetS, n 5 2; and hypertension, n 5 4; Supporting
Table C). Furthermore, of the 85 studies, 72 diag-
nosed NAFLD by a clinical report. Of the 72 studies
in which NAFLD was diagnosed clinically, 11 were
done by blood test, 59 by imaging (43 for NAFLD),
and two by a combination of imaging and blood tests.
Mean/median age of patients ranged from 30.70 to
76.20 years; male sex distribution ranged from 0.00%
to 100.00%; white race distribution ranged from
40.70% to 95.10%; and years of publication ranged
from 1990 to 2015.
NAFLD PREVALENCE
The pooled overall global prevalence of NAFLD
diagnosed by imaging was estimated to be 25.24%
(95% confidence interval [CI]: 22.10-28.65). NAFLD
prevalence estimates were stratified by region (Fig. 3A-
F; Table 1) and by age (Table 2; for all diagnostic
modalities, please see Supporting Figs. 1A-F and 2).
The highest prevalence of NAFLD was reported from
South America and the Middle East, whereas the low-
est rate was reported from Africa (Table 1). Addition-
ally, the prevalence of NAFLD increases with age
(Table 2), though the number of studies for subjects
>70 years old is very limited.
Although we estimated the prevalence of NAFLD
by imaging from its diagnostic accuracy, a number of
studies reported the prevalence of NAFLD using
blood tests, a much less reliable method diagnosing
NAFLD. The pooled regional NAFLD prevalence
estimates among patients diagnosed by blood test were
13.00% (95% CI: 4.44-32.47) for Europe, 12.89%
(95% CI: 8.32-19.44) for North America, and 9.26%
(95% CI: 7.07-12.05) for Asia. The funnel plot for the
prevalence data is depicted in Supporting Fig. 3.
NAFLD INCIDENCE
Because of the small number of studies that con-
tained NAFLD incidence results, meta-analysis results
were obtained only for Asia (only available for China
and Japan)31,42 (for references 102 and 103, please see
the Supporting Information) and Israel (Supporting
Table D)64 (for reference 104, please see the Support-
ing Information). The pooled regional NAFLD inci-
dence rate estimates for Asia and Israel were 52.34 per
1,000 (95% CI: 28.31-96.77) and 28.01 per 1,000
person-years (95% CI: 19.34-40.57), respectively.
NASH PREVALENCE AMONG
NAFLD PATIENTS
The pooled overall NASH prevalence estimate
among biopsied NAFLD patients was 59.10% (95%
CI: 47.55-69.73). NASH prevalence estimates among
NAFLD patients were also stratified by region and
biopsy indication status (Supporting Table E). The
pooled regional NASH prevalence estimates among
NAFLD patients with an indication for biopsy were
63.45% (95% CI: 47.68-76.79) for Asia, 69.25% (95%
CI: 55.93-79.98) for Europe, and 60.64% (95% CI:
49.56-70.72) for North America. On the other hand,
NASH prevalence estimates among NAFLD patients
without an indication for biopsy were 6.67% (95% CI:
2.17-18.73) for Asia and 29.85% (95% CI: 22.72-
38.12) for North America.
OBESITY PREVALENCE AMONG
NAFLD AND NASH PATIENTS
The pooled overall obesity prevalence estimates
among NAFLD patients and among NASH patients
were 51.34% (95% CI: 41.38-61.20) and 81.83% (95%
CI: 55.16-94.28; Supporting Tables J and K), respec-
tively.
The
regional
obesity
prevalence
estimates
among NAFLD patients diagnosed by imaging were
63.96% (95% CI: 48.54-76.96) for Asia, 36.76% (95%
CI: 19.58-58.13) for Europe, and 57.02% (95% CI:
47.82-65.76) for North America. The regional obesity
prevalence estimates among NASH patients with
biopsy indication status were 89.19% (95% CI: 74.51-
95.88) for Europe, 95.24% (95% CI: 82.86-98.81) for
Oceania, and 45.45% (95% CI: 26.47-65.86) for South
America. The regional obesity prevalence estimate
among NASH patients without biopsy indication for
North America was 80.00% (95% CI: 64.83-89.67).

The pooled overall hypertriglyceridemia prevalence
estimates among NAFLD and among NASH patients
were 40.74% (95% CI: 30.80-51.50; Table 3) and
83.33% (95% CI: 36.87-97.72; Supporting Table F),
respectively. The regional hypertriglyceridemia preva-

The pooled overall hypertension prevalence esti-
mates among NAFLD and among NASH patients
were 39.34% (95% CI: 33.15-45.88) and 67.97% (95%
CI: 56.31-77.74; Supporting Tables F and G), respec-
tively. The regional hypertension prevalence estimates
among NAFLD and NASH patients are summarized
in Supporting Table F.
PREVALENCE OF MetS AMONG
NAFLD AND NASH PATIENTS
The pooled overall MetS prevalence estimates
among NAFLD and among NASH patients were
42.54% (95% CI: 30.06-56.05) and 70.65% (95% CI:
54.64-82.79), respectively. The regional MetS preva-
lence estimates among NAFLD and NASH patients
are summarized in Supporting Table F.
FIBROSIS PROGRESSION
Given the heterogeneity of definitions used to describe
non-NASH NAFLD, we limited our fibrosis progression
in those patients who had histological NASH at baseline.
Fibrosis progression rate and percent fibrosis progression
data among NAFLD patients were available from four
and six studies, respectively (Table 3). The pooled mean
annual fibrosis progression rate estimate for patients with
histological NASH was 0.09 (95% CI: 0.06-0.12) and
the percent progressed was 40.76% (95% CI: 34.69-
47.13; Supporting Table E)(5,6),31 (for references 105-
108, please see the Supporting Information).
DEVELOPMENT OF ADVANCED
FIBROSIS, HCC, LIVER-SPECIFIC
MORTALITY, AND OVERALL
MORTALITY
Incidence rates for the progression of fibrosis and
the development of HCC and mortality were stratified
by NAFLD or NASH status (Table 3 and Supporting
Tables H and I). The incidence of advanced fibrosis in
NASH was 67.95 in 1,000 person-years (95% CI:
46.84-98.59). Approximately 41% (95% CI: 34.69-
47.13) of the NASH patients experience fibrosis pro-
gression, which is an average annual progression rate of
0.09% (95% CI: 0.06-0.12). We did not calculate the
advancement rate for NAFLD patients because we felt
that the majority of NAFLD patients with biopsy may
have had NASH given that they were selected for liver
biopsy.
The annual incidence of HCC in NAFLD patients
was 0.44 per 1,000 person-years (95% CI: 0.29-0.66),
whereas for NASH the annual HCC incident rate was
5.29 per 1,000 person-years (95% CI: 0.75-37.56).
The pooled liver-specific and overall mortality inci-
dence rate estimates among NAFLD cohorts were 0.77
per 1,000 person-years (95% CI: 0.33-1.77 events) and
15.44 per 1,000 person-years (95% CI: 11.72-20.34
events; Table 3), respectively. The pooled liver-specific

 and overall mortality incidence rate estimates among
NASH cohorts were 11.77 per 1,000 person-years (95%
CI: 7.10-19.53 events) and 25.56 per 1,000 person-years
(95% CI: 6.29-103.8 events), respectively.
The pooled NAFLD versus non-NAFLD incidence
rate ratio (IRR) estimate for liver-specific mortality was
1.94 (95% CI: 1.28-2.92), whereas the pooled IRR esti-
mate for overall mortality estimate was 1.05 (95% CI:
0.70-1.56). On the other hand, the adjusted hazard ratio
(AHR) for NAFLD liver-specific mortality was 2.60
(0.91-7.42) and for overall mortality 1.04 (1.03-1.04).
STUDY HETEROGENEITY AND
BIAS
The heterogeneity between NAFLD prevalence stud-
ies was considerable, as is evident by the large worldwide
and regional I2 statistics (99.07% worldwide, 84.37% for
Africa, 99.17% for Asia, 98.78% for Europe, 98.78% for
the Middle East, 99.14% for North America, and
69.10% for South America). The univariate metaregres-
sion results indicated that publication year was the only
factor that significantly explained this heterogeneity
worldwide (6.85% of the heterogeneity [P5 0.0269];
however, after the studies that used blood tests to diagno-
sis NAFLD were removed from the analysis, publication
year was only marginally significant [P5 0.08]; Support-
ing Tables J and K). Stratifying the analysis by year cate-
gories (2000-2005, 2006-2010, and 2011-2015) indicates
that there is a steady upward trend in the prevalence esti-
mates. The pooled worldwide NAFLD prevalence esti-
mates during 2000-2005, 2006-2010, and 2011-2015
respectively were 20.13% (95% CI: 10.03-36.31), 23.75%
(95% CI: 17.86-30.84), and 26.80 (95% CI: 23.47-
30.42). The Begg-Mazumdar Test did not detect any
bias (P5 0.9532). Furthermore, neither the funnel plot
(Supporting Fig. 3) nor the Egger Test results indicated
that any publication or related biases were present
(P5 0.4522; Supporting Tables J and K). When strati-
fied by region, neither the Begg-Mazumdar Test nor the
Egger Test detected any bias (data not shown).
Discussion
This meta-analysis included 8,515,431 individuals
in order to determine the prevalence, incidence, risk
factors, and long-term outcomes of patients with
NAFLD worldwide. From the available data, we esti-
mate that 25% of the adult population in the world has
NAFLD. Although NAFLD is highly prevalent in all
continents, the highest prevalence rates were reported
from South America (31%) and the Middle East
(32%) whereas the lowest prevalence was reported
from Africa (14%). Our results also confirm previous
findings of similarity in NAFLD prevalence between
the United States and Europe.(19) However, an inter-
esting finding was the relatively high prevalence of
NAFLD found in the Asian population (27%), as well

 as their higher prevalence of obesity (64%), which may
be a result of using a lower body mass index (BMI)
cutpoint for obesity (BMI �25; for references 110-
112, please see the Supporting information).
Another significant finding in this study was the
impact of diagnostic modality that was used to diagno-
sis NAFLD. Given the known clinical presentation of
NAFLD with fluctuating liver enzymes, studies that
used liver enzyme elevation (blood testing) in the
absence of other causes of liver disease were found to
significantly underestimate the true prevalence of
NAFLD. In fact, our analysis estimating the preva-
lence of NAFLD by liver enzymes (blood tests only)
consistently yielded lower estimates than those studies
that used imaging. In North America, for example, the
prevalence of NAFLD was 24% by ultrasound, but
only 13% by blood testing. Furthermore, studies using
blood testing have little agreement in their definitions
of elevated liver enzyme tests (Supporting Table A). In
fact, aminotransferase levels may be only mildly ele-
vated in NAFLD so up to 78% of NAFLD patients
may actually have normal liver enzymes (for references
113-115, please see the Supporting information).
These findings may explain why there was no longer a
publication bias when the studies using blood tests as
their sole means of diagnosing NAFLD were removed
from the primary analysis; so, for this reason, our pri-
mary data for prevalence rates were calculated from
studies that used imaging modalities to diagnose
NALFD. These data also confirm the importance of
choosing the most accurate modality to diagnose
NAFLD such as imaging or histology (for reference
116, please see the Supporting information).
Our metaregression identified an association between
year of study publication and an increase in NAFLD
prevalence globally (15% in 2005 to 25% in 2010), which
is consistent with the increasing global prevalence of obe-
sity, a known risk factor for NAFLD.(11) Our findings
are corroborated by the findings of other multiyear studies
that have also reported a rise in NAFLD prevalence. A
recent study using data from the U.S. National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey found that NAFLD
prevalence doubled between the survey periods of 1988-
1994 and 2005-2008 (for reference 92, please see the
Supporting information). A screening center in Japan also
reported an significant increase in the prevalence of
NAFLD when they found a 2.4-fold increase in steatosis
prevalence over a 10-year period (1989-1998; for refer-
ence 117, please see the Supporting information).
Previous studies have reported that NASH was found
to be present in one third of NAFLD patients (for refer-
ences 91 and 122, please see the Supporting informa-
tion). In our meta-analysis, the global prevalence of
NASH among biopsied NAFLD patients was almost
double the previous studies’ findings at 59.1% (95% CI:
47.6-69.7). However, there may be a selection and ascer-
tainment bias in this estimate because the NAFLD
patients in our NASH studies were typically selected as
candidates for biopsy on the basis of a high index of sus-
picion for steatohepatitis, given that they were experienc-
ing elevated transaminases or other clinical signs of liver
disease. However, one can estimate that 7%-30% of
NAFLD patients who underwent voluntary liver biopsies
had NASH (Supporting Table J). This indicates that the
overall prevalence of NASH is between 1.5% and 6.45%.
As expected, there was a high burden of metabolic
comorbidities associated with NAFLD, creating implica-
tions for clinical management of the disease. Obesity was
present in 51% of individuals with NAFLD and 82% of
NASH patients, confirming previous findings that obese
individuals make up a significant proportion of NAFLD
cases (for references 93 and 123, please see the Supporting
information). Diabetes mellitus was identified in 23% of
NAFLD cases and 47% of NASH cases, which exceeds
that of the general population and is comparable to diabe-
tes prevalence among the obese (12.4%; Public Health
England). Diabetes in NAFLD is a risk factor for pro-
gression to NASH, cirrhosis, and mortality (for references
124 and 125, please see the Supporting information), and
poor glycemic control increases the risk of fibrosis in
NASH (for references 105 and 126-128, please see the
Supporting information). The prevalence of metabolic
syndrome among NAFLD patients was 41% and 71% in
NASH, with hyperlipidemia/dyslipidemia (NAFLD,
69%; NASH, 72%) common as well. The high preva-
lence of MetS and hyperlipidemia in NAFLD patients
suggests that risk stratification and aggressive treatment is
needed to control the risk of CVD in these patients (for
reference 129, please see the Supporting information).(1)
Long-term clinical outcomes of NAFLD were also
assessed in this study. We found, in those with histo-
logical NASH, that advanced fibrosis occurred at a rate
of 67.95 per 1,000 person-years, or approximately 9%
of patients with NASH have advancement of their
fibrosis. These are important findings given that recent
investigations have shown that when patients with
NASH reach the stage of cirrhosis, their odds for
developing HCC or dying increase. In fact, in one
study where the median follow-up was 3.2 years, inves-
tigators found an annual cumulative HCC incidence of
2.6% for NASH-related cirrhosis (for reference 100,
please see the Supporting Information).
YOUNOSSI ET AL.
HEPATOLOGY, July 2016
82
 We also found that the annual incidence of HCC in
NAFLD patients was 0.44 per 1,000 person-years,
suggesting that HCC is a rare complication in
NAFLD given that the incidence is 15- to 35-fold
lower than that of chronic hepatitis B (for references
130 and 135, please see the Supporting Information).
However, the incidence rate for HCC in NASH
patients was quite significant at 5.29 cases per 1,000
person-years. Though the reported incidence rates are
lower than those reported for patients with HBV or
HCV. Given the high burden of NAFLD and
NASH, the number of patients with NAFLD- and
NASH-related HCC will continue to increase. These
results have far-reaching implications for resource utili-
zation given that HCC has emerged as the sixth-most
common cancer and second-leading etiology of cancer-
related deaths worldwide (for reference 100, please see
the Supporting Information).
Our study also showed that NAFLD and, especially,
NASH patients have higher liver-specific mortality and,
possibly, overall mortality. This is consistent with previ-
ous studies that have shown that patients with NASH
can develop significant long-term outcomes. Although
the study differentiated NASH from overall NAFLD,
we believe that most of the long-term outcomes of
patients in the NAFLD category are driven by those
who have underlying NASH. In this study, it was not
possible to determine the outcomes of patients that have
non-NASH type of NAFLD (for references 130-135,
please see the Supporting Information). Consistent with
previous data, in NAFLD patients, the incidence of car-
diovascular (CV) mortality was higher than liver-related
mortality (Table 3). Nevertheless, if we included studies
that we defined NAFLD by both ultrasound and liver
enzymes, CV mortality was not increased. In contrast, if
NAFLD was diagnosed by ultrasound, IRR for CV
mortality was increased at 1.37 [95% CI (1.23-1.54)].
These data indicate the importance of accurate diagnosis
of NAFLD and the higher risk for CV mortality in
those with established diagnosis of NAFLD.
This study has several strengths. We present the
results of a literature search using targeted MESH
search terms to capture studies screening for NAFLD
geographically. Prevalence and progression were estab-
lished using a diagnosis of NAFLD that excluded etiol-
ogies for fatty liver that may bias results, such as viral
hepatitis and significant alcohol consumption. The
prevalence data reflect the general adult population,
stratified for population-based versus referral prevalence
measures. Study design was taken into account when
comparing NAFLD prevalence rates.
Limitations of the present study include high unex-
plained heterogeneity in included studies and under-
representation of underdeveloped countries in the data
set. Countries of very high human development as
defined by the 2013 Human Development Index,
which scores life expectancy, mean years of schooling,
and gross national income per capita, were over-
represented in this study’s NAFLD prevalence estima-
tion (n 5 13 of 22 countries; countries of high human
development: n 5 7 of 22), and only two countries of
medium or low human development were included.
Obesity is more prevalent in the developed world;
however, the obesity prevalence gap between the devel-
oped and developing world is narrowing (for reference
109, please see the Supporting Information). Even
impoverished, largely nonobese populations in the
developing world have been found to harbor significant
nonalcoholic fatty liver and progressive NAFLD (for
references 135 and 136, please see the Supporting
Information). Despite these limitations, this study pro-
vides the most in-depth assessment of the global epi-
demiological burden of NAFLD.
In summary, our meta-analysis clearly identifies
NAFLD as a common cause of liver disease world-
wide, which warrants the attention of primary care
physicians, specialists, and health policy makers. One
fifth to one quarter of adults in the developed world
have NAFLD, with a large proportion of these
patients having a clinical indication to undergo a
biopsy for the diagnosis of NASH. NAFLD is not
only a disease of the obese, but is typically associated
with metabolic dysfunction. The high frequency of
metabolic comorbidities in NAFLD indicates that
NAFLD patients are unhealthy and may place a grow-
ing strain on health systems from their need for man-
agement. Furthermore, the large number of NAFLD
patients with potential for progressive liver disease cre-
ates challenges for screening. Future study should be
devoted to defining the economic and public health
burden of the NAFLD pandemic.
