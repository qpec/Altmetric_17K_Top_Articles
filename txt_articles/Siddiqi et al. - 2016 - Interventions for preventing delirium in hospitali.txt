Background
Delirium is a common mental disorder, which is distressing and has serious adverse outcomes in hospitalised patients. Prevention of
delirium is desirable from the perspective of patients and carers, and healthcare providers. It is currently unclear, however, whether
interventions for preventing delirium are effective.
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of interventions for preventing delirium in hospitalised non-Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients.
Search methods
We searched ALOIS - the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group’s Specialized Register on 4 December 2015 for
all randomised studies on preventing delirium. We also searched MEDLINE (Ovid SP), EMBASE (Ovid SP), PsycINFO (Ovid SP),
Central (The Cochrane Library), CINAHL (EBSCOhost), LILACS (BIREME), Web of Science core collection (ISI Web of Science),
ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO meta register of trials, ICTRP
.
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of single and multi- component non-pharmacological and pharmacological inter-
ventions for preventing delirium in hospitalised non-ICU patients.
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors examined titles and abstracts of citations identified by the search for eligibility and extracted data independently,
with any disagreements settled by consensus. The primary outcome was incidence of delirium; secondary outcomes included duration
and severity of delirium, institutional care at discharge, quality of life and healthcare costs. We used risk ratios (RRs) as measures of
treatment effect for dichotomous outcomes; and between group mean differences and standard deviations for continuous outcomes.

 Main results
We included 39 trials that recruited 16,082 participants, assessing 22 different interventions or comparisons. Fourteen trials were
placebo-controlled, 15 evaluated a delirium prevention intervention against usual care, and 10 compared two different interventions.
Thirty-two studies were conducted in patients undergoing surgery, the majority in orthopaedic settings. Seven studies were conducted
in general medical or geriatric medicine settings.
We found multi-component interventions reduced the incidence of delirium compared to usual care (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.81;
seven studies; 1950 participants; moderate-quality evidence). Effect sizes were similar in medical (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.92; four
studies; 1365 participants) and surgical settings (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.85; three studies; 585 participants). In the subgroup of
patients with pre-existing dementia, the effect of multi-component interventions remains uncertain (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.36;
one study, 50 participants; low-quality evidence).
There is no clear evidence that cholinesterase inhibitors are effective in preventing delirium compared to placebo (RR 0.68, 95% CI,
0.17 to 2.62; two studies, 113 participants; very low-quality evidence).
Three trials provide no clear evidence of an effect of antipsychotic medications as a group on the incidence of delirium (RR 0.73, 95%
CI, 0.33 to 1.59; 916 participants; very low-quality evidence). In a pre-planned subgroup analysis there was no evidence for effectiveness
of a typical antipsychotic (haloperidol) (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.60; two studies; 516 participants, low-quality evidence). However,
delirium incidence was lower (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.52; one study; 400 participants, moderate-quality evidence) for patients
treated with an atypical antipsychotic (olanzapine) compared to placebo (moderate-quality evidence).
There is no clear evidence that melatonin or melatonin agonists reduce delirium incidence compared to placebo (RR 0.41, 95% CI
0.09 to 1.89; three studies, 529 participants; low-quality evidence).
There is moderate-quality evidence that Bispectral Index (BIS)-guided anaesthesia reduces the incidence of delirium compared to BIS-
blinded anaesthesia or clinical judgement (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.85; two studies; 2057 participants).
It is not possible to generate robust evidence statements for a range of additional pharmacological and anaesthetic interventions due to
small numbers of trials, of variable methodological quality.
Authors’ conclusions
There is strong evidence supporting multi-component interventions to prevent delirium in hospitalised patients. There is no clear
evidence that cholinesterase inhibitors, antipsychotic medication or melatonin reduce the incidence of delirium. Using the Bispectral
Index to monitor and control depth of anaesthesia reduces the incidence of postoperative delirium. The role of drugs and other
anaesthetic techniques to prevent delirium remains uncertain.

Interventions to prevent delirium in hospitalised patients, not including those on intensive care units
Review question
We reviewed the evidence for the effectiveness of interventions for preventing delirium in hospitalised patients, not including those on
intensive care units (ICU) (specialised wards for the care of critically ill patients).
Background
Delirium is a common and serious illness for people admitted to hospital. It can be distressing for patients and their families. It also
increases the chances of developing other complications in hospital, being admitted to a care home or dying in hospital. Delirium is a
very expensive condition for health services. Prevention of delirium is therefore desirable for patients, families and health services.
There are many risk factors for developing delirium (e.g. infection, dehydration, certain medications). Therefore, one approach (called
‘multi-component interventions’) to preventing delirium is to target these multiple risk factors. Some medications have effects on the
brain chemicals implicated in developing delirium, and may, therefore, have a role in prevention. There are also a number of other
interventions that target delirium risk factors related to anaesthesia and medical treatment around the time of surgery.

Interventions for preventing delirium in hospitalised non-ICU patients (Review)
Copyright © 2016 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 This evidence is current to 4 December 2015. We found 39 trials that recruited 16,082 participants testing 22 different multi-
component interventions, medications or anaesthetic interventions, compared to usual care, placebo, or different interventions.
Key findings
We found strong evidence that multi-component interventions can prevent delirium in both medical and surgical settings and less
robust evidence that they reduce the severity of delirium. Evidence about their effect on the duration of delirium is inconclusive.
There is evidence that monitoring the depth of anaesthesia can reduce the occurrence of delirium after general anaesthetic.
We found no clear evidence that a range of medications or other anaesthetic techniques or procedures are effective in preventing
delirium.
Quality of the evidence
There is moderate-quality evidence to indicate that multi-component interventions reduce the incidence of delirium. The evidence
supports implementing multi-component delirium prevention interventions into routine care for patients in hospital.
There is moderate-quality evidence that monitoring depth of general anaesthesia can be used to prevent delirium postoperatively.
The quality of the evidence for a range of medications or other anaesthetic techniques or procedures for preventing delirium is poor
(because of the small number of trials and the variable quality of trial methods), and cannot be used to inform changes to practice.

Description of the condition
Delirium is a disturbance of consciousness and cognition, which
usually has a rapid onset and a fluctuating course. It has been var-
iously termed acute organic brain syndrome, acute organic men-
tal disorder and toxic confusional state. Until the 19th century
delirium was used to describe a disorder of thinking and later de-
scriptions included disturbances of perception, often with over-
active behaviour, or impaired consciousness. The publication of
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) III (APA 1987) in 1987
brought these ideas together, combining disturbance of conscious-
ness with impairment of cognition. The core features of delirium
(disturbance in attention, changes in cognition, and acute on-
set and fluctuating course) have now been clarified in the Inter-
national Classification of Diseases version 10 (ICD-10) (WHO
1992), DSM-IV (APA 1994), and most recently DSM-V (APA
2013). This consensus has allowed some standardisation of re-
search, and greater comparability between studies, although dif-
ferences remain, such as the requirement for evidence of an un-
derlying cause in DSM-IV and DSM-V, but not in ICD-10.
Delirium is common in hospitalised patients. Ten per cent to 30%
of admissionstoageneral hospital developdelirium(Levkoff 1991;
Trzepacz 1996) and in general medical inpatients, occurrence rates
ranging from 11% to 42% have been reported (Siddiqi 2006).
Delirium has a prevalence of up to 60% in frail elderly patients
(Francis 1990), and 7% to 9.6% in elderly patients presenting
to emergency departments (Elie 2000; Hustey 2003). Following
coronary artery bypass grafting in the elderly, the incidence has
been reported as 33.6% (Santos 2004), and after bilateral knee re-
placements 41% (Williams-Russo 1992). Following hip fracture,
the overall prevalence is 43% to 61% (Holmes 2000). Cancer also
increases the risk of developing delirium; 18% of those admitted
to an oncology ward, and 26% to 44% of those admitted to hos-
pital or a hospice with a diagnosis of advanced cancer developed
delirium (Centeno 2004; Ljubisavljevic 2003). In patients with
AIDS who are unwell enough to be admitted, incidence of delir-
ium is also high, being reported as 46% (Uldall 1997).
Delirium is serious, with significant short- and long-term out-
comes. Mortality is increased (McCusker 2002), functional abili-
ties reduced (Moller 1998), admission to long-term care increased
(Inouye 1998a), and length of stay increased (McCusker 2003a;
Stevens 1998). Impairment of cognitive function can persist for
at least one year (McCusker 2001), as can the symptoms of delir-
ium, especially inattention, disorientation and impaired mem-
ory (McCusker 2003b). Increasingly recognised is the distress an
episode of delirium produces for both sufferers and their carers
(Breitbart 2002).
Research in older people has identified a range of risk factors for
delirium. The condition clearly has a multi-factorial aetiology, and
these risk factors interact (Inouye 1998b); the more risk factors
that are present, the greater the likelihood that the patient will
develop delirium. Risk factors that have so far been identified in-
clude: increased age, sensory deprivation (visual or hearing im-
pairment), sleep deprivation, social isolation, physical restraint,
use of bladder catheter, iatrogenic adverse events, poly-pharmacy
(more than three new medications added), use of psychoactive
drugs, co-morbidities, severe illness (especially infection, fracture
or stroke), prior cognitive impairment, temperature abnormality
(fever or hypothermia), dehydration, malnutrition and low serum
albumin (Inouye 1998b; Inouye 1999c; NICE 2010).
Studies in oncology patients have also identified a range of risk
factors for delirium, for example bone metastases, the presence of
haematological malignancy, advanced age, cognitive impairment,
and low albumin levels (Ljubisavljevic 2003).
The identification of such a varied list of aetiological factors sug-
gests several things. First, we may be able to identify patients at
high risk of developing delirium, and by modifying these risk fac-
tors could attempt to prevent it; such prevention strategies could
be targeted to specific groups of patients.
Second, many of these risk factors can be seen as hospital ’quality
of care’ measures, e.g. malnutrition, dehydration, use of physical
restraints, iatrogenic events. Occurrence of delirium can, there-
fore, be seen as a proxy measure of the quality of inpatient care
(Inouye 1999b; Inouye 2014); and effective interventions to pre-
vent delirium may be considered integral to quality improvement.
Qualityimprovementisamajorissue forhealthcare, particularlyin
services for older people (Institute for Innovation 2006). We know
that healthcare systems and services, internationally, have not kept
pace with demographic transitions, and often fail to meet the com-
plex needs requiring multidisciplinary care of growing numbers
of older people (Hubbard 2004). General hospitals, in fact, fre-
quently have attributes that unintentionally stimulate or aggravate
delirium (Young 2007). However, addressing this is challenging
and requires wide-ranging changes to systems of care. Focusing on
delirium prevention may help develop the necessary professional
skills, cultural aspects, and service design in such a way as to drive
up quality of care.
Prevention of delirium is clearly desirable for both patients and
carers, and can also reduce health service costs. Healthcare costs
in patients who developed delirium in intensive care units (ICUs)
were 31% higher ($41,836 versus $27,106) (Milbrandt 2004).
A non-randomised study of a multi-component intervention for
delirium also demonstrated overall improved cost-effectiveness (
Rizzo 2001).
Description of the intervention
This review assesses the effectiveness of non-pharmacological and
pharmacological interventions for preventing delirium in hospi-
talised patients, excluding the ICU setting.
A range of non-pharmacological interventions for preventing
delirium in hospitalised patients have been developed. Most have
6

 taken a multi-factorial approach to delirium prevention, attempt-
ing to prevent several risk factors by protocols, education or sys-
tems redesign, (Cole 2002; Inouye 2000; Milisen 2001), although
some target a single risk factor only. Examples include programmes
of education for ward nursing staff (Rockwood 1999), protocols
targeting specific risk factors and implemented by a trained in-
terdisciplinary team (Inouye 1999a; Young 2015), and specialist
nursing interventions to educate nursing staff, assess and change
medication, encourage mobilisationandimprove the environment
of the patient (Wanich 1992).
Pharmacological interventions are based on an understanding of
the multiple neurotransmitter pathways involved in developing
delirium and substances that might potentially modify these or
modify other important risk factors. These include, for example,
cholinesterase inhibitors, antipsychotics and analgesics. There are
also a number of other interventions that target delirium risk fac-
tors related to surgery and perioperative care, such as varying ap-
proaches to anaesthesia, optimising blood transfusion, and post-
operative pain relief.
How the intervention might work
Delirium has many risk factors and precipitating factors, some
of which may be modifiable. Previous work has suggested that a
combination of risk factors may interact to increase vulnerability
to delirium, and models to predict this risk have been developed
and validated (Inouye 1993a). Measures to reduce the number or
severity of these factors may help to prevent delirium and may
attenuate the poor outcomes associated with it.
Single- and multi-component non-pharmacological interventions
target one or more of these risk factors.
Pharmacological interventions either target the important neuro-
transmitter pathways that have been implicated in the complex
pathophysiology of delirium ((e.g. antipsychotics, cholinesterase
inhibitors) or aim to address important risk factors such as sleep
and pain (e.g. melatonin and gabapentinoids).
Various anaesthetic approaches and perioperative procedures also
address potential risk factors for delirium.
Why it is important to do this review
Given that delirium is associated with such poor outcomes (Witlox
2010), which do not appear to be modified with treatment (NICE
2010), interventions to prevent delirium may be particularly im-
portant. Previous reviews (Cole 1999; Milisen 2005) have sug-
gested a role for multi-component delirium prevention interven-
tions, but have not been systematic or have employed less rigorous
selection criteria. A previous Cochrane review of delirium preven-
tion in hospitalised patients published in 2007 found the evidence
was sparse and recommended further research was needed (Siddiqi
2007). It is currently unclear whether interventions for prevention
of delirium are effective.

Criteria for considering studies for this review
Types of studies
We only considered randomised controlled trials for this review.
Types of participants
We included patients aged 16 years or over, admitted to acute
general hospitals and at risk of developing delirium. We excluded
studies conducted in ICU as both the population and interven-
tions in this setting are likely to be very different. We also excluded
community settings e.g. nursing homes. We excluded studies in
mixed settings unless data could be extracted separately for hospi-
talised inpatients.
Types of interventions
We considered all non-pharmacological and pharmacological in-
terventionsdesignedtopreventdelirium.Trialsincludingacontrol
group receiving standard care and trials comparing two types of
intervention were included. Trials of co-ordinated multi-strategy
initiatives to prevent delirium (multi-component interventions)
were included. We defined standard care as the usual care available
on that unit.
Types of outcome measures
We identified the primary, secondary and adverse outcome mea-
sures that are important for patients, carers and for health and
social care systems.
Primary outcomes

the
Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group’s Spe-
cialized Register on 4th December 2015. The advanced search was
used to retrieve all randomised studies in which delirium was the
focus.
ALOIS is maintained by the Trials Search Co-ordinator and con-
tains studies in the areas of dementia prevention, dementia treat-
ment and cognitive enhancement in healthy. The studies were
identified from the following searches.
1. Monthly searches of a number of major healthcare
databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO and
LILACS
2. Monthly searches of a number of trial registers: ISRCTN;
UMIN (Japan’s Trial Register); the WHO portal (which covers
ClinicalTrials.gov; ISRCTN; the Chinese Clinical Trials Register;
the German Clinical Trials Register; the Iranian Registry of
Clinical Trials and the Netherlands National Trials Register, plus
others)
3. Quarterly search of The Cochrane Library’s Central Register
of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)
4. Six-monthly searches of a number of grey literature sources:

Details of the search strategies used for the retrieval of reports of
trials from the healthcare databases, CENTRAL and conference
proceedings can be viewed in the ‘Methods used in reviews’ sec-
tion within the editorial information about the Dementia and
Cognitive Improvement Group.
We performed additional searches in many of the sources listed
above to cover the time frame from the last searches performed for
ALOIS, to ensure that the search for the review was as up-to-date
and as comprehensive as possible. The search strategies used can
be seen in Appendix 1 and results of the searches in Appendix 2.
Searches conducted between October 2008 and December 2015
retrieved a total of 542 results after initial de-duplication and first
assessment by the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improve-
ment Group’s Trials Search Co-ordinator.
Searching other resources
We reviewed bibliographies of books and review articles on delir-
ium, and also references from retrieved articles. We contacted ex-
perts in this field for further references and to locate unpublished
trials. The Internet was searched using the search engines Google
and Copernic to try to find further evidence of unpublished trials
using the same terms as stated above.
We did not apply any time restrictions or language constraints.
Data collection and analysis
Selection of studies
Two review authors independently examined all titles and abstracts
of citations identified by the search for eligibility, and assessed full
texts of potentially eligible studies for inclusion. All disagreements
were resolved by consensus.

 Data extraction and management
Two review authors used a piloted data extraction form to extract
data on each study independently, and settled any disagreements
by consensus. We created a table of ’Characteristics of included
studies’ using Review Manager 5 (RevMan 2012). Review authors
were not blinded to study authors and institution for study selec-
tion, data extraction or quality assessment. Reports from the same
study were collated under a single study reference.
For delirium incidence and severity, where results were presented
for multiple time points and no summary data were available, we
used the highest recorded number or peak values for the inter-
vention and control arm. This was because we were interested in
interventions that reduced the overall burden of delirium. For ex-
ample, if delirium severity was ascertained on days one, three, and
five of the hospital stay, then we included only the highest of those
three ascertainments in our analysis of delirium severity.
For severity and duration of delirium, data were included only
from patients with delirium.
To allow use of more of the reported data for syntheses, where
medians and Interquartile ranges (IQR) or ranges were presented
rather than means and standard deviations, we converted values as
follows. We assumed the median value was equivalent to the mean.
We estimated the standard deviation as ’IQR/1.35’ or ’range/4’
(small studies, n < 70) or ’range/6’ (larger studies, n > 70).
Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
Two review authors independently assessed risks of bias for all in-
cluded studies using the criteria described in the Cochrane Hand-
bookfor Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Cochrane Handbook
2011). We assessed included trials for adequacy of sequence gen-
eration, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome
data, selective outcome reporting and other potential sources of
bias. For each domain, we made a judgement of low risk, high risk
or unclear risk of bias and presented these in a ’Risk of bias’ table
for each study. We settled any disagreements by consensus.
Measures of treatment effect
We used risk ratios (RRs) as measures of treatment effect for di-
chotomous outcomes; and between group mean differences and
standard deviations for continuous outcomes.
Dealing with missing data
Missing data and dropout rates were assessed for each of the in-
cluded studies. We reported the number of participants included
in the final analysis as a proportion of all participants in the study.
An available case analysis was performed, including data only on
those whose results were known. Incomplete outcomes assessment
was reported in the ’Risk of bias’ table for each study and discussed
in the main text to enable consideration of the potential impact
of missing data.
Data synthesis
We synthesised dichotomous outcomes for meta-analysis and cal-
culated pooled RRs with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using ran-
dom-effects methods. We synthesised continuous outcomes and
calculated pooled mean differences, or standardised mean differ-
ences with 95% CIs using random-effects inverse variance meth-
ods.
Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity
We conducted a pre-planned intervention level subgroup anal-
ysis for multi-component delirium prevention interventions in
surgical and medical settings, and for studies reporting delirium
in the presence of diagnosed dementia. We carried out a further
pre-planned intervention level subgroup analysis to investigate
whether typical and atypical antipsychotic medications were asso-
ciated with varying levels of effectiveness.
Data presentation - ’Summary of findings’ tables
We used the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment,
Development and Evaluation) approach to assess the quality of
the supporting evidence behind each estimate of treatment effect
(Schunemann 2011a; Schunemann 2011b) for selected key inter-
ventions and outcomes. We presented key findings of the review
including a summary of the amount of data, the magnitude of the
effect size and the overall quality of the evidence, in ’Summary of
findings’ tables, created using GRADEpro software (GRADEpro
2014). We selected the following interventions: multi-component
delirium prevention interventions; cholinesterase inhibitors; an-
tipsychotics; melatonin and bispectral-index guided-anaesthesia;
and the following outcomes: incidence of delirium, severity of
delirium, duration of delirium, length of admission, return to in-
dependent living and in-hospital mortality, as being most relevant
for clinical practice across a range of hospital settings.

Study design
Fourteen studies were placebo-controlled trials (Al-Aama 2011;
de Jonghe 2014; Diaz 2001; Hatta 2014; Kalisvaart 2005;
Larsen 2010; Leung 2006; Liptzin 2005; Marcantonio 2011;
Mouzopoulos 2009; Munger 2008; Pesonen 2011; Sampson
2007; Whitlock 2015). Fifteen studies evaluated a delirium pre-
vention intervention against usual care (Abizanda 2011; Aizawa
2002; Ashraf 2015; Bonaventura 2007; Boustani 2012; Fukata
2014; Gauge 2014; Gruber-Baldini 2013; Hempenius 2013; Jeffs
2013; Jia 2014; Lundstrom 2007; Marcantonio 2001; Martinez
2012; Urban 2008). Ten studies compared two different interven-
tions (Beaussier 2006; Berggren 1987; Chan 2013; Li 2013; Lurati
2012; Papaioannou 2005; Radtke 2013; Sieber 2010; Stoppe
2013;Watne 2014).
Sample Size
The sample size of included studies was highly variable, ranging
from 15 to 7507 randomised participants. Eighteen studies ran-
domised less than 100 participants, of which eight randomised
less than 50 (Aizawa 2002; Ashraf 2015; Hatta 2014; Leung 2006;
Marcantonio 2011; Munger 2008; Stoppe 2013; Urban 2008).
Setting
Thirty- two studies were conducted in patients undergoing surgery
or procedural interventions.
Orthopaedic practice was the most common setting (18 studies).
Six of these evaluated interventions in patients undergoing elec-
tive arthroplasty or joint replacement (Kalisvaart 2005; Larsen
2010; Leung 2006; Liptzin 2005; Sampson 2007; Urban 2008);
11 included patients undergoing hip fracture repair Berggren
1987; de Jonghe 2014; Diaz 2001; Gruber-Baldini 2013; Li
2013; Lundstrom 2007; Marcantonio 2001; Marcantonio 2011;
Mouzopoulos 2009; Sieber 2010; Watne 2014), and one study
was conducted in combined elective and emergency orthopaedic
settings (Munger 2008).
Four studies were in patients undergoing cardiac surgery (Gauge
2014; Pesonen 2011; Stoppe 2013; Whitlock 2015); and one
in patients undergoing inpatient cardiac catheterisation (Ashraf
2015).
Two studies were in patients undergoing surgery for cancer
(Hempenius 2013 and Jia 2014), the latter specifically for colorec-
tal cancer.
Two studies were in patients having general and colorectal surgery
or colorectal surgery alone (Aizawa 2002; Beaussier 2006).
Five studies were in patients undergoing various other elec-
tive surgical procedures (Chan 2013; Fukata 2014; Lurati 2012;
Papaioannou 2005; Radtke 2013). One of these included pa-
tients having abdominal surgery under general anaesthesia or or-
thopaedic surgery under general or spinal anaesthesia (Fukata
2014); and one study was in patients undergoing non-cardiac
surgery under general anaesthesia (Lurati 2012).
Only seven studies (2011 participants) evaluated interventions
in a general medical or geriatric medical hospital environment
(Abizanda 2011; Al-Aama 2011; Bonaventura 2007; Boustani
2012; Hatta 2014; Jeffs 2013; Martinez 2012 ).
Participants
Age
In 29 studies, participants had a mean age in both allocation arms
of more than 70 years. Six studies had a mean age of less than 70
years in one or both groups (Chan 2013; Liptzin 2005; Radtke
2013; Sampson 2007; Stoppe 2013; Whitlock 2015); and two
studies had very low mean age of included participants, Urban
2008 (mean age 53 and 48 years in the intervention and control
groups respectively) and Leung 2006 (overall mean age 59.6 years).
Two studies did not present data on the mean age of participants
(Bonaventura 2007; Papaioannou 2005).
Co-morbidities
Eight studies used the Charlson Index (Charlson 1994) (Boustani
2012; de Jonghe 2014; Hatta 2014; Jeffs 2013; Leung 2006;
Marcantonio 2001; Martinez 2012; Sieber 2010) to compare co-
morbidities between intervention and control groups. One study
(Boustani 2012), reported higher Charlson Index scores in the
usual care group.
Five studies presented the total number of co-morbidities present
for intervention and control groups (Abizanda 2011; Al-Aama
2011; Bonaventura 2007; Diaz 2001; Hempenius 2013).

 Nine studies presented the frequency of a range of specific co-
morbidities in both the intervention and control groups (Ashraf
2015; Berggren 1987; Chan 2013; Gruber-Baldini 2013; Jia 2014;
Lundstrom 2007; Lurati 2012; Pesonen 2011; Whitlock 2015).
Lundstrom 2007 reported a difference between the intervention
and control arms, with a higher rate of depression in the control
group, and Ashraf 2015 had higher rates of coronary artery dis-
ease in the usual care group and higher rates of depression in the
intervention group.
Seventeenstudiesdidnotreportco-morbiditiesatbaseline (Aizawa
2002; Beaussier 2006; Fukata 2014; Gauge 2014; Kalisvaart
2005; Larsen 2010; Li 2013; Liptzin 2005; Marcantonio 2011;
Mouzopoulos 2009; Munger 2008; Papaioannou 2005; Radtke
2013; Sampson 2007; Stoppe 2013; Urban 2008; Watne 2014).
Dementia
Eleven of the included studies excluded participants with demen-
tia. This included using dementia diagnosis as an exclusion crite-
ria (Diaz 2001; Jia 2014; Larsen 2010) or based on performance
in cognitive testing (Ashraf 2015; Berggren 1987; Bonaventura
2007; Chan 2013; Li 2013; Papaioannou 2005; Radtke 2013;
Stoppe 2013), most commonly using the Mini-Mental State Ex-
amination (MMSE) score (Folstein 1975).
There were three studies where the proportion of participants with
dementia differed between the intervention and control groups: in
Gruber-Baldini 2013, it was 27.3% in intervention versus 36.1%
in control; in Lundstrom 2007, 27.5% in intervention versus
37.1% in control; and in Marcantonio 2001, 37% in intervention
and 51% in control.
Interventions
Multi-component interventions
Seven studies (2018 participants) evaluated non-pharmacologi-
cal multi-component interventions (Abizanda 2011; Bonaventura
2007; Hempenius
2013; Jeffs 2013;
Lundstrom
2007;
Marcantonio 2001; Martinez 2012) in comparison to usual care.
Individual components of each multi-component intervention are
summarised in Table 1. The number of components varied be-
tween two (Jeffs 2013) and 13 (Hempenius 2013) (Table 1). Most
included individualised care, an educational component, reorien-
tation, and early mobilisation. Many of the delirium risk factors
targeted with multi-component interventions relate to good basic
care. The nature in which interventions were implemented varied
between the studies: some relied on a protocol-driven approach
(Bonaventura 2007; Jeffs 2013; Marcantonio 2001), whilst others
were more pragmatic in the delivery of the intervention (e.g. the
family delivered the reorientation intervention in Martinez 2012).
Twostudieswere basedontherapistinterventions (Abizanda 2011;
Jeffs 2013), one was multidisciplinary including a Comprehen-
sive Geriatric Assessment (Lundstrom 2007), and two were based
on proactive perioperative input from a geriatrician (Hempenius
2013; Marcantonio 2001).
Pharmacological interventions
Thirteen studies assessed various pharmacological agents.
Although the pathophysiology of delirium remains unclear, acetyl-
choline is the neurotransmitter that has been most implicated
in studies (Koponen 1999; Tune 1999), leading to suggestions
that cholinesterase inhibitors may have a role in delirium manage-
ment. Four studies tested the use of prophylactic cholinesterase
inhibitors (Liptzin 2005; Marcantonio 2011; Munger 2008;
Sampson 2007).
Three studies assessed antipsychotic medication (Fukata 2014;
Kalisvaart 2005; Larsen 2010).
Melatonin is a hormone that has a role in sleep/wake regulation,
and may be responsible for the disruption of the sleep/wake cycle
seen in delirium (Figueroa-Ramos 2009). This has led to sugges-
tions that it could have a role in delirium prevention (Lewis 2004).
Melatonin supplementation has been proposed as a treatment op-
tion for delirium (Bourne 2006), and there is case report evidence
of its usefulness (Hanania 2002). Two studies investigated the use
of melatonin (Al-Aama 2011; de Jonghe 2014 ); and one used a
melatonin agonist (Hatta 2014).
Citicoline (cytidine 5′-diphosphocholine (CDP-choline)), is a
drug that has been implicated in cognitive impairment and mem-
ory, and therefore has been proposed as a treatment in traumatic
brain injury, stroke, vascular dementia, Parkinson’s disease, and
brain aging (Fioravanti 2006a). Citicoline has the function in the
brain of stabilising cell membranes and reducing the presence of
free radicals. In particular, there is some evidence that citicoline
stimulates the release of dopamine neurotransmitters in the brain
(Fioravanti 2005). One study tested citicoline (Diaz 2001).
Diazepam is a long-acting benzodiazepine which is often used as
an anxiolytic and has been used in the cardiac catheterisation set-
ting with good effect (Woodhead 2007). Diphyenhydramine is
an antihistamine medication which can cause sedation and has
been used as an adjunct for individuals undergoing colonoscopy
with good effect (Tu 2006). Evidence regarding premedication and
postoperative delirium is unclear (Fines 2006) with concern that
administering these medications may increase rates of post-proce-
dure or postoperative delirium. One study evaluated the combina-
tion of diazepam and diphenhydramine as premedication before
cardiac catheterisation (Ashraf 2015).
Methylprednisolone is an intravenous steroid preparation with a
wide range of clinical uses. Steroid use has been thought to be ben-
eficial to individuals undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass, with
evidence of reduction in new onset atrial fibrillation, postopera-
tive bleeding and length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU)
(Whitlock 2008). A subsequent clinical trial failed to show bene-
13

 fit for the entire population undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass,
but subgroup analysis suggested those at higher risk of adverse
outcomes may benefit (Dieleman 2012). This formed the basis
of the design of Whitlock 2015, evaluating methylprednisolone
for those at high risk undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass, with
incidence of delirium as a safety outcome measure.
Perioperative interventions
Postoperative delirium is a common complication of surgery in
older people (Holmes 2000; Santos 2004; Williams-Russo 1992),
likely to be a consequence of the physiological and biochemical de-
rangement induced by the underlying pathology, surgical trauma
pain and anaesthesia. Perioperative care is, therefore, a potential
focus for interventions to reduce postoperative delirium.
In surgical practice, there has been a move towards a concept
of ‘enhanced recovery’ whereby surgical intervention, anaesthesia
and postoperative care are modified in such a way as to minimise
the overall impact of surgery, reducing postoperative complica-
tions and expediting recovery (Douglas 2001). Many postopera-
tive complications (e.g. ileus, respiratory depression, chest infec-
tions, and myocardial ischaemia, all of which may predispose to
delirium) could be reduced by the use of regional anaesthesia and
opioid-sparing analgesics (Bonnet 2005).
Eighteen studies tested various interventions addressing modifica-
tions to perioperative practice that might influence postoperative
delirium. These are subdivided into five broad approaches; i) those
that reduce opioid utilisation, ii) those that control/reduce depth
of general anaesthesia, iii) those that consider alternative forms
of general anaesthesia, iv) those which avoid general anaesthesia
altogether and v) a miscellaneous group including studies investi-
gating transfusion practice, fast track surgery and a ’delirium-free
protocol’.
i) Opioid-sparing measures:
Techniques to reduce opioid utilisation include the administration
of adjuvant analgesics; addition of intrathecal opioid to general
anaesthesia; and peripheral local anaesthetic blockade. These were
tested in six studies.
Gabapentinoids are commonly used for treatment of epilepsy, anx-
iety, and neuropathic pain, but also have a role as opioid-sparing
adjuncts for postoperative pain relief (Tippana 2007). Leung 2006
tested gabapentin and Pesonen 2011 tested pregabalin.
Ketamine is widely used as an adjuvant analgesic in a variety of
perioperative pain settings (Bell 2006). Urban 2008 investigated
the effect of adding ketamine at induction of anaesthesia as a
postoperative infusion.
Parecoxib sodium is an intravenous analgesic preparation called a
pro-drug of another medication, valdecoxib, which is a selective
cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitor (Cheer 2001). The use of non-opioid
adjuvant analgesia is a recognised approach to reduce the need for
opiate medication and thus the associated side effects, particularly
for older adults (Aubrun 2007). One study compared a regimen of
regular intravenous parecoxib to a dose of morphine followed by
administration of saline as postoperative analgesia, with morphine
doses available to either group based on their pain scores.
The use of a ‘single shot spinal’ combined with general anaesthesia
and patient controlled analgesia (PCA) is increasingly used as an
alternative to continuous epidural infusions for intra and postop-
erative analgesia. The premise is that intrathecal opioid, with or
without local anaesthetic adequately replaces an epidural regard-
ing its intended benefits of reduced intraoperative and immediate
postoperative opioid requirements, but without prolonged motor
block or hypotension that would impede immediate postopera-
tive mobilisation. Beaussier 2006 tested using a ’single shot spinal’
with general anaesthesia compared to general anaesthesia alone;
and Mouzopoulos 2009 tested a fascia iliac compartment block
performed every 24 hours from admission to discharge compared
to treatment with paracetamol and intramuscular pethidine for
patients with a fractured neck of femur.
ii) Controlling/reducing the depth of anaesthesia:
Finer titration of depth of anaesthesia could reduce delirium. Bis-
pectral index (BIS), a number derived from analysis of the EEG,
is increasingly used to monitor depth of anaesthesia. A BIS value
of 100 is equivalent to full awareness and a value of 0 represents
no electrical activity.
Sieber 2010 investigated light compared to deep sedation. Light
sedation was represented by a BIS value of 80 and a patient re-
sponsive to vocal commands; and deep sedation by a BIS value of
50 and a patient unresponsive to noxious stimuli (i.e. equivalent
to the effect of a general anaesthetic). Chan 2013 compared BIS-
guided anaesthesia to routine general anaesthesia with propofol.
In the BIS-guided group, the propofol infusion was titrated to
maintain a BIS value of 40 to 60, whereas in the routine group
anaesthesia was titrated according to clinical judgement. Radtke
2013 compared BIS-guided and BIS-blinded groups undergoing
induction and maintenance of general anaesthesia and postoper-
ative analgesia for a range of surgical interventions. Gauge 2014
compared targeted BIS and cerebral oxygenation monitoring for
patients undergoing coronary bypass grafting compared to no BIS
and oxygenation monitoring.
iii) Changing the mode of general anaesthesia:
Two studies explored the effect of mode of general anaesthesia,
one using propofol (Stoppe 2013) and the other xenon (Lurati
2012), compared to sevoflurane.

 iv) Avoiding general anaesthesia:
Two studies compared regional anaesthesia with general anaesthe-
sia (Berggren 1987; Papaioannou 2005).
v) Miscellaneous perioperative interventions:
The remaining three studies each tested a different perioperative
intervention.
Intraoperative blood transfusion has been implicated as a risk fac-
tor postoperative delirium (Carson 2011; Robinson 2009), al-
though there are likely to be other aspects of the individual’s con-
dition or care which also influence the risk of developing delirium
(Edelstein 2004). Gruber-Baldini 2013 tested the use of liberal
versus restrictive blood transfusion thresholds.
Jia 2014 tested fast-track surgery compared to usual care; this ap-
proach as a means of reducing delirium and postoperative cogni-
tive dysfunction has been suggested previously (Krenk 2012). The
fast-track approach tested by Jia 2014 included alterations in the
preoperative preparation, anaesthesia, pain control and postoper-
ative management compared to traditional care. This included:
bowel preparation with oral purgatives rather than enemas, shorter
period of fasting, avoidance of nasogastric tube, epidural rather
than general anaesthesia and earlier removal of urinary catheter
and mobilisation on the first postoperative day.
Aizawa 2002 tested a postoperative delirium-free protocol (DFP),
which contained benzodiazepines and pethidine compared to
usual care. They administered intramuscular diazepam at 8 pm
with a continuous infusion of flunitrazepam to maintain sleep and
pethidine for analgesia, given for eight hours for the first three
nights after surgery.
Computerised clinical decision support (CCDS)
Computerisedclinical decisionsupportsoftware (CCDS)has been
reported as an effective tool in prompting healthcare practitioners
to comply with established protocols and preventive measures (
Dexter 2001). It has also been trialled for improving the care of
patients with delirium superimposed on dementia (Fick 2011).
One study in our review (Boustani 2012), investigated the use of
CCDS in medical inpatients.
Care in geriatric medicine unit versus orthopaedic unit
following hip fracture
Individuals admitted following a fracture are typically placed un-
der the care of an orthopaedic surgeon, pending operative inter-
vention. However, the complex nature of the predominantly older
adult population who experience a hip fracture has led to the emer-
gence of orthogeriatric services, where input is also received from
geriatricians. Comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) is an ev-
idence-based “multidimensional interdisciplinary diagnostic pro-
cess used to determine the medical, psychological and functional
capabilities of a frail older person to develop a coordinated and
integrated plan for treatment and long-term follow-up” associated
with improved outcomes, particularly when delivered in a dedi-
cated ward (Ellis 2011). Watne 2014 designed their trial around
their local service reconfiguration where older adults were admit-
ted to their specialist geriatric medicine unit and received CGA
comparing this to the care received in the orthopaedic unit.
Outcomes
Primary outcome
The incidence of delirium was recorded using several validated
instruments, used singly or in combination.
In 15 studies, the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) (Inouye
1990) alone was used to determine delirium incidence (Abizanda
2011; Ashraf 2015; Beaussier 2006; Boustani 2012; Chan 2013;
Gauge 2014; Jeffs 2013; Leung 2006; Lurati 2012; Marcantonio
2001; Martinez 2012; Munger 2008; Sieber 2010; Urban 2008;
Whitlock 2015). However, Munger 2008 presented data for the
mean CAM score, rather than using the CAM score to deter-
mine delirium presence as a dichotomous outcome. The CAM-
ICU (Ely 2001) was used in two studies (Pesonen 2011; Stoppe
2013), although Pesonen 2011 used it as a continuous measure.
DiagnosticandStatistical Manual (DSM-III and DSM-IV)criteria
alone were used in five studies (Aizawa 2002; Li 2013; Lundstrom
2007; Papaioannou 2005; Radtke 2013). Jia 2014 used the DRS-
R-98 (Trzepacz 2001) to diagnose incident delirium. Berggren
1987 used the Modified Organic Brain Syndrome Scale (OBS)
(Gustafson 1985); Fukata 2014 used the NEECHAM confusion
scale (Neelon 1996); and Sampson 2007 used the Delirium Symp-
tom Interview (DSI) (Albert 1992).
Ten studies used multiple instruments for assessing delirium,
some of which included measures to assess delirium severity.
The CAM (Inouye 1990) and Memorial Delirium Assessment
Scale (MDAS) (Breitbart 1997) were used by Al-Aama 2011;
Gruber-Baldini 2013; Marcantonio 2011 and Watne 2014. How-
ever, Marcantonio 2011 only reported aggregated data for re-
peatedCAMassessmentswithinthe same participant,which could
not, therefore, be included in analysis of the primary outcome.
Bonaventura 2007 used the CAM and DRS-R-98. DSM III-R or
IV were used in addition to the CAM by Kalisvaart 2005; to which
Hatta 2014; Larsen 2010 and Mouzopoulos 2009 added the DRS-
R-98; while Liptzin 2005 added the DSI. de Jonghe 2014 also used
the Delirium Observation Screening Scale (DOSS) (Schuurmans
2003) in addition to DSM-IV. Hempenius 2013 used the DOSS
which, if positive, resulted in an assessment using DSM-IV criteria
and the DRS-R-98.

Interventions for preventing delirium in hospitalised non-ICU patients (Review)

 Nineteen studies assessed for delirium on a daily basis (Abizanda
2011; de Jonghe 2014; Diaz 2001; Fukata 2014; Hatta 2014;
Hempenius 2013; Jia 2014; Kalisvaart 2005; Larsen 2010;
Leung 2006; Liptzin 2005; Marcantonio 2001; Martinez 2012;
Mouzopoulos 2009; Munger 2008; Papaioannou 2005; Pesonen
2011; Stoppe 2013;Watne 2014 ). Marcantonio 2011 assessed for
delirium daily until discharge and again at two, four and six weeks
after recruitment.
Three studies assessed delirium several times a day: Radtke 2013
and Aizawa 2002 conducted delirium assessments twice daily and
Sampson 2007 assessed three times daily.
Delirium assessments were performed on days one, two, four and
seven following admission by Bonaventura 2007, and on the first
and seventh postoperative day by Berggren 1987. Al-Aama 2011
assessed participants every 24 to 48 hours and Jeffs 2013 assessed
every48hours.Boustani 2012 assessedparticipantseveryweekday.
Urban 2008 assessed for delirium on postoperative day (POD)
one; Lurati 2012 assessed on POD one, two and seven; and Sieber
2010 assessed on POD two and daily thereafter.
At the end of one study (Lundstrom 2007), a retrospective case
notes review was performed by a blinded independent investigator
to identify delirium according to DSM-IV criteria for each post-
operative day until discharge. A single delirium assessment with
the OBS was also performed between the third and fifth postop-
erative day in this study. In Gauge 2014, delirium assessment was
performed on day three +/- one day. Whitlock 2015 assessed only
on postoperative day three, and Li 2013 assessed on postoperative
day three and at one, three and six months. Ashraf 2015 assessed
for delirium four hours post-procedure and on the following day.
In three studies the specific frequency of delirium assessment was
unclear (Beaussier 2006; Chan 2013; Gruber-Baldini 2013), but
described as ’regularly’, ’throughout study period’ or ’multiple
times’.
Secondary outcomes
Duration of delirium was reported by 12 studies (de Jonghe 2014;
Fukata 2014; Jeffs 2013; Kalisvaart 2005; Larsen 2010; Liptzin
2005; Lundstrom 2007; Marcantonio 2001; Martinez 2012;
Mouzopoulos 2009; Sieber 2010; Watne 2014). Severity of delir-
ium was reported by 11 studies (Al-Aama 2011; de Jonghe 2014;
Gruber-Baldini 2013; Hatta 2014; Hempenius 2013; Jeffs 2013;
Kalisvaart 2005; Larsen 2010; Marcantonio 2011; Mouzopoulos
2009; Watne 2014).
Fourteen studies reported data on cognitive outcomes (Ashraf
2015; Beaussier 2006; Bonaventura 2007; Chan 2013; de
Jonghe 2014; Diaz 2001; Larsen 2010; Li 2013; Munger 2008;
Papaioannou 2005; Pesonen 2011; Radtke 2013; Sieber 2010;
Watne 2014). Mode of cognitive assessment varied: Ashraf 2015;
Bonaventura 2007, Diaz 2001, Larsen 2010; Munger 2008;
Papaioannou 2005 and Sieber 2010 used the Mini Mental State
Examination (MMSE) (Folstein 1975); Beaussier 2006 assessed
the number of days for MMSE to return to preoperative level;
Chan 2013; Li 2013; Radtke 2013 and Watne 2014 assessed
for postoperative cognitive dysfunction; Pesonen 2011 used the
CAM-ICU score on day five; and de Jonghe 2014 used IQ-
CODE (Jorm 1989) and MMSE (Folstein 1975) assessment at
three months follow-up.
Length of hospital admission was a commonly used outcome mea-
sure, with only 11 of the included studies not reporting on this out-
come (Bonaventura 2007; Diaz 2001; Fukata 2014; Gauge 2014;
Hatta 2014; Larsen 2010; Leung 2006; Lurati 2012; Marcantonio
2011; Mouzopoulos 2009; Urban 2008).
Other secondary outcomes which were reported less frequently
included: activities of daily living (Abizanda 2011; Watne 2014);
behavioural disturbance (Aizawa 2002); activities of daily living
performance (Abizanda 2011; de Jonghe 2014; Watne 2014);
psychotropic medication use (Al-Aama 2011; de Jonghe 2014;
Gruber-Baldini 2013; Pesonen 2011); return to previous residence
or independent living (Hempenius 2013; Jeffs 2013; Lundstrom
2007; Marcantonio 2001); and institutionalisation (Watne 2014).
Adverse Outcomes
Only 15 of the included studies reported data on mortality, ei-
ther in hospital or at follow-up at three or 12 months (Abizanda
2011; Al-Aama 2011; Beaussier 2006; Boustani 2012; Chan 2013;
de Jonghe 2014; Hatta 2014; Lundstrom 2007; Lurati 2012;
Mouzopoulos 2009; Radtke 2013; Sieber 2010; Stoppe 2013;
Watne 2014; Whitlock 2015).
Other adverse outcomes reported include: adverse events (
Abizanda 2011; Hatta 2014; Kalisvaart 2005; Marcantonio 2011;
Sampson 2007); physical morbidity (Berggren 1987; Boustani
2012; Gruber-Baldini 2013; Larsen 2010; Watne 2014); psy-
chological morbidity (Berggren 1987; Chan 2013; Hempenius
2013; Lundstrom 2007); postoperative complications (Chan
2013; Hempenius 2013; Jia 2014; Papaioannou 2005; Sieber
2010; Whitlock 2015); falls (Boustani 2012; Hempenius 2013;
Lundstrom 2007; Martinez 2012; Watne 2014); and pressure ul-
cers (Berggren 1987; Boustani 2012; Lundstrom 2007; Watne
2014).
Exclusion of prevalent delirium at baseline
Failure to exclude delirium at enrolment to the study was a com-
mon problem among included studies. Only 10 studies clearly
excluded or accounted for prevalent cases of delirium at baseline
(Abizanda 2011; Ashraf 2015; Boustani 2012; de Jonghe 2014;
Hatta 2014; Gruber-Baldini 2013; Jeffs 2013; Kalisvaart 2005;
Martinez 2012; Sieber 2010).
Funding sources and declarations of interest
Most of the studies (24 out of 39) were funded via academic or
governmental research institutions or grant funding schemes. Four
16

 studies were solely industry funded (Boustani 2012; Liptzin 2005;
Munger 2008; Sampson 2007) and two received joint academic
and industry funding (Lurati 2012; Radtke 2013). In nine studies
the funding source was not reported (Aizawa 2002; Ashraf 2015;
Bonaventura 2007; Diaz 2001; Gauge 2014; Jia 2014; Martinez
2012; Mouzopoulos 2009; Sieber 2010).
Eight studies reported there were potential interests to declare
related to their publication (Boustani 2012; Gruber-Baldini 2013;
Hatta 2014; Larsen 2010; Leung 2006; Liptzin 2005; Lurati 2012;
Stoppe 2013), which are listed in the Characteristics of included
studies tables. Fourteen studies did not report on a declaration
of interest (Aizawa 2002; Ashraf 2015; Beaussier 2006; Berggren
1987; Bonaventura 2007; Gauge 2014; Li 2013; Lundstrom 2007;
Marcantonio 2001; Munger 2008; Papaioannou 2005; Sampson
2007; Sieber 2010;Urban 2008).
Excluded studies
We excluded 69 studies. Reasons for exclusion are given in
Characteristics of excluded studies. Details of 27 studies identified
as ongoing are given in Characteristics of ongoing studies.
Risk of bias in included studies
’Risk of bias’ assessments are presented for each study in the ’
Characteristics of included studies’ table andare summarisedinthe
text below and graphically in Figure 2. Only one study (Whitlock
2015) was assessed as at low risk of bias across all domains.

 Allocation
Only one study (Bonaventura 2007) was assessed as high risk for
selection bias considering both allocation concealment and ran-
dom sequence generation. This was as a consequence of using
the day of admission as the basis for their randomisation, which
cannot be concealed. Nine studies (Aizawa 2002; Ashraf 2015;
Berggren 1987; Gauge 2014; Liptzin 2005; Munger 2008; Radtke
2013; Sieber 2010; Stoppe 2013) were considered as unclear risk
for selection bias on both criteria. This assessment was primarily
made on the grounds of a lack of detail in the published report
around the methods of generating the sequence and allocating
participants to groups.
Blinding
Twenty-three of the included studies (Abizanda 2011; Aizawa
2002; Ashraf 2015; Berggren 1987; Bonaventura 2007; Boustani
2012; Chan 2013; Fukata 2014; Gruber-Baldini 2013; Hatta
2014; Hempenius 2013; Jeffs 2013; Jia 2014; Lundstrom 2007;
Lurati 2012; Marcantonio 2001; Martinez 2012; Mouzopoulos
2009; Papaioannou 2005; Radtke 2013; Stoppe 2013; Urban
2008; Watne 2014) were assessed as high risk for performance
bias as participants and personnel were not blinded to their al-
location, often due to the nature of the intervention precluding
such concealment. However, only six studies (Ashraf 2015; Fukata
2014; Gruber-Baldini 2013; Lundstrom 2007; Martinez 2012;
Watne 2014) were assessed at high risk of both performance and
detection bias due to the assessors being unblinded in addition
to participants and personnel. A further eight studies (Beaussier
2006; Bonaventura 2007; Boustani 2012; Gauge 2014; Jia 2014;
Mouzopoulos 2009; Munger 2008; Papaioannou 2005) were as-
sessed as unclear risk for detection bias due to a lack of reporting.
Incomplete outcome data
Ten studies were assessed as high risk for attrition bias (Al-Aama
2011; Chan 2013; Larsen 2010; Liptzin 2005; Mouzopoulos
2009; Papaioannou 2005; Pesonen 2011; Radtke 2013; Sampson
2007; Urban 2008). This was due to incomplete reporting of losses
or concerns about reasons for exclusion of participants. In partic-
ular, there were concerns about exclusions which may influence
ascertainment of the primary outcome (delirium incidence) e.g.
participants being too unwell to be assessed or developing post-
operative complications. A further seven studies were considered
at unclear risk for attrition bias (Aizawa 2002; Diaz 2001; Fukata
2014; Gauge 2014; Hempenius 2013; Kalisvaart 2005; Munger
2008. In these cases it was not possible to assess the potential bias
associated with loss of participants due to a lack of detail in study
reports.
Selective reporting
Three studies were assessed as high risk of reporting bias (Beaussier
2006; Berggren 1987; Lurati 2012). In all cases this was due to the
reportingof outcomesnotstatedinthe protocol or the methodsfor
the study. Twelve studies were considered at low risk of reporting
bias(Abizanda 2011; deJonghe 2014; Gruber-Baldini 2013; Hatta
2014; Hempenius 2013; Jeffs 2013; Larsen 2010; Marcantonio
2011; Radtke 2013; Stoppe 2013; Watne 2014; Whitlock 2015),
with evidence of published protocols, formal trial registration or
clear statement in relation to reporting contained in the published
text. The remainder were assessed as unclear risk.
Other potential sources of bias
Seven studies were assessed as high risk of bias in this category
(Aizawa 2002; Gruber-Baldini 2013; Li 2013; Lundstrom 2007;
Marcantonio 2001; Papaioannou 2005; Watne 2014).
In Aizawa 2002 no account was taken of how delirium assessment
may have been affected by the sedating effects of the delirium-
free protocol. Similarly in Papaioannou 2005, there were concerns
about unbalanced use of neuraxial analgesia between groups, af-
fecting delirium assessment. Li 2013 administered supplementary
morphine to both groups depending on pain scores, but use of
this is significantly unbalanced and this is not accounted-for in
the interpretation of delirium findings. In Watne 2014, there are
concerns about the integrity of the intervention delivered as the
trial was conducted pragmatically and when beds were not avail-
able in the specialist unit, patients were cared-for in the corridor,
but are counted in the intervention group.
The proportion of included participants with dementia was im-
balanced in three studies (Gruber-Baldini 2013; Lundstrom 2007;
Marcantonio 2001). In all cases there was a lower proportion of
individuals with dementia in the intervention arm than the con-
trol arm. This has the potential to affect rates of incident delirium
as delirium is known to be more common in individuals with de-
mentia (Fong 2015).
Publication of two studies as abstracts (Gauge 2014; Munger
2008) gave insufficient information to allow for other sources of
bias to be assessed, resulting in an assessment of unclear risk.

1. Multi-component interventions versus usual care
Seven studies investigated the effectiveness of multi-component
interventions for the prevention of delirium (Abizanda 2011;
Bonaventura 2007; Hempenius 2013; Jeffs 2013; Lundstrom
2007; Marcantonio 2001; Martinez 2012). A summary of find-
ings for key outcomes is presented in Summary of findings for the
main comparison.
a. Primary outcome
Available case analysiswasperformedon1950of 2018randomised
participants, using data from all seven studies. Pooled analysis
showed evidence of a reduction in the incidence of delirium for
multi-component interventions compared to usual care (risk ratio
(RR) 0.69, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.59 to 0.81, I2 = 0%;
1950 participants. We assessed this as moderate-quality evidence
(downgraded due to risk of bias) (Analysis 1.1; Figure 3).
Figure 3.
Forest plot of comparison: 1 Multi-component delirium prevention intervention (MCI) versus
usual care, outcome: 1.1 Incident delirium.
b. Secondary outcomes
We pooled data on the duration of delirium from four trials (Jeffs
2013; Lundstrom 2007; Marcantonio 2001; Martinez 2012). The
mean difference between groups was -1.16 days (shorter in the
intervention group) but there was uncertainty about the size and
direction of the effect (mean difference (MD) -1.16, 95% CI -
2.96 to 0.64, I2 = 58%; 244 participants; assessed as very low-
quality evidence due to imprecision, risk of bias and inconsistency)
(Analysis 1.3).
Delirium severity was reported as an outcome in only two multi-
component intervention trials, each of which used different mea-
sures of severity (Hempenius 2013; Jeffs 2013). Compared with
usual care the standardised mean difference (SMD) in delirium
severity was -1.04 (lower with multi-component interventions)
(SMD -1.04, 95% CI -1.65 to -0.43, I2 = 25%; 67 participants;
low-quality evidence due to risk of bias and imprecision) (Analysis
1.4).
We pooled data from six studies, which reported length of hos-
pital admission (Abizanda 2011; Hempenius 2013; Jeffs 2013;
Lundstrom 2007; Marcantonio 2001; Martinez 2012). The mean
length of hospital admission was 0.01 days longer in the interven-
20

 tion compared to the usual care group (MD 0.01, 95% CI -0.48
to 0.51, I2 = 13%; 1920 participants; moderate-quality evidence
due to risk of bias) (Analysis 1.5).
One study assessed cognition (Bonaventura 2007); there was a
clinically important difference in the mean MMSE score favouring
those receiving multi-component interventions compared to usual
care (MD 9.10, 95% CI 7.20 to 11.00; 60 participants; very low-
quality evidence due to risk of bias and serious imprecision) (
Analysis 1.6).
Abizanda 2011 reported on the number of participants whose
Barthel Index score (Mahoney 1965) improved by 10 points dur-
ing admission, comparing this between the groups. There was no
evidence of effect of multi-component interventions on improve-
ments in activities of daily living compared to usual care (RR
1.15, 95%CI0.91to 1.47; 341 participants;low-qualityevidence,
downgraded due to risk of bias and imprecision) (Analysis 1.7).
Four studies (Hempenius 2013; Jeffs 2013; Lundstrom 2007;
Marcantonio 2001) reported on return to independent living.
Again, there was no evidence of effect of multi-component inter-
ventions compared to usual care (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.06,
I2 = 30%; 1116 participants; moderate-quality evidence, down-
graded due to risk of bias) (Analysis 1.8).
Lundstrom 2007 assessed depression with the Geriatric Depres-
sion Scale-15 (GDS-15) (Sheikh 1986), but found no evidence
of any important effect of the intervention on this outcome (MD
0.70, 95% CI -0.44 to 1.84; 149 participants; low-quality evi-
dence, downgraded due to risk of bias and imprecision) (Analysis
1.9).
One study reported no withdrawals from 126 participants (
Marcantonio 2001) (Analysis 1.10).
c. Adverse outcomes
Data on falls were only available from three studies (Hempenius
2013; Lundstrom 2007; Martinez 2012), there was no evidence
of effect from multi-component interventions compared to usual
care (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.16 to 2.01, I2 = 50%; 746 participants;
very low-quality evidence, downgraded due to risk of bias, serious
imprecision and inconsistency) (Analysis 1.11).
Rates of pressure ulcers were only reported in two studies
(Hempenius 2013; Lundstrom 2007) where there was evidence of
a reduced risk of pressure ulcer formation in those receiving multi-
component interventions compared to usual care (RR 0.48, 95%
CI 0.26 to 0.89, I2 = 0%; 457 participants; low-quality evidence
downgraded, due to risk of bias and imprecision) (Analysis 1.12).
Inpatient mortality was reported in three studies (Abizanda 2011;
Hempenius 2013; Lundstrom 2007), with no evidence of effect of
multi-component interventions on inpatient mortality (RR 0.90,
95% CI 0.56 to 1.43, I2 = 57%; 859 participants; very low-quality
evidence, downgraded due to risk of bias, imprecision and incon-
sistency) (Analysis 1.13).
Lundstrom 2007 also reported on 12-month mortality and found
no evidence of effect of multi-component interventions (RR 0.85,
95% CI 0.46 to 1.56; 199 participants; low-quality evidence due
to risk of bias and imprecision) (Analysis 1.14).
Hempenius 2013 reported on postoperative complications and
there was no evidence of effect of multi-component interven-
tions on cardiovascular adverse events (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.78 to
1.65; 260 participants; moderate-quality evidence due to impre-
cision) or urinary tract infections (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.45 to 3.20;
260 participants; low-quality evidence due to serious imprecision)
(Analysis 1.15; Analysis 1.16). Hempenius 2013 also reported on
psychological morbidity, reporting SF-36 scores for mental health
(Ware 1992), dichotomized to having worsened versus improve-
ment/stayed the same and there was no evidence of effect found
(RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.20; 246 participants; moderate-qual-
ity evidence due to imprecision) (Analysis 1.17).
Subgroup analysis by setting
The pre-planned subgroup analysis assessed multi-component
delirium prevention trials in four medical (Abizanda 2011;
Bonaventura 2007; Jeffs 2013; Martinez 2012) and three surgi-
cal (Hempenius 2013; Lundstrom 2007; Marcantonio 2001) set-
tings. There were similar effect sizes in medical (RR 0.63, 95% CI
0.43 to 0.92; 1365 participants) and surgical (RR 0.71, 95% CI
0.59 to 0.85; 585 participants) settings in favour of the interven-
tion reducing incident delirium (moderate-quality evidence due
to risk of bias for both) (Analysis 1.1; Figure 3).
Subgroup analysis by cognitive impairment
Only one trial (Marcantonio 2001) reported incident delirium
in patients with pre-existing dementia. In the intervention group
37% of participants were known to have dementia, compared
to 51% of those in the control group. Delirium incidence was
lower in patients receiving a multi-component intervention in this
subgroup also. However, the results are too imprecise to allow
a conclusion to be drawn (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.36; 50
participants; low-quality evidence, downgraded due to risk of bias
and imprecision) (Analysis 1.2).
2. Cholinesterase inhibitors versus placebo
Four studies investigated the effect of the cholinesterase in-
hibitor donepezil in the prevention of delirium (Liptzin 2005;
Marcantonio 2011; Munger 2008; Sampson 2007). A ’Summary
of findings’ table for key outcomes is presented in Summary of
findings 2.
a. Primary outcome
Data from only two of these four studies (Liptzin 2005; Sampson
2007) could be used to estimate the primary outcome, delirium
incidence, as Marcantonio 2011 reported repeated CAM measures
21
Interventions for preventing delirium in hospitalised non-ICU patients (Review)
Copyright © 2016 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 within the same individuals, and Munger 2008 reported mean
CAM scores only. There was no evidence of effect of cholinesterase
inhibitors on incident delirium (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.17 to 2.62, I
2 = 60%; 113 participants; very low-quality evidence due to risk of
bias, serious imprecision and inconsistency) (Analysis 2.1; Figure
4).
Figure 4.
Forest plot of comparison: 2 Prophylactic cholinesterase inhibitor versus placebo, outcome: 2.1
Incident delirium.
b. Secondary outcomes
The effect of cholinesterase inhibitors on the duration of delirium
episodes was assessed by Liptzin 2005, but no summary estimate
was calculable due to the limited data available (Analysis 2.2).
The effect of cholinesterase inhibitors on the severity of delirium
episodes was assessed by Marcantonio 2011 who reported no ev-
idence of effect (MD -0.30, 95% CI -4.17 to 3.57; 16 partici-
pants; low-quality evidence, downgraded two levels due to serious
imprecision) (Analysis 2.3).
Pooled data from three studies reporting length of hospital ad-
mission (Liptzin 2005; Munger 2008; Sampson 2007) showed a
mean difference of -0.34 days with cholinesterase inhibitor treat-
ment compared to placebo (MD -0.34, 95% CI -1.54 to 0.86, I
2 = 45%; 128 participants; low-quality evidence downgraded due
to risk of bias and imprecision) (Analysis 2.4).
One study examining the effect of cholinesterase inhibitor on cog-
nition (Munger 2008) found no evidence of effect on MMSE
(Folstein 1975) scores (MD -1.40, 95% CI -4.45 to 1.65; 15 par-
ticipants; very low-quality evidence, downgraded due to risk of
bias and serious imprecision) (Analysis 2.5).
Two studies reported withdrawals from protocol (Liptzin
2005; Marcantonio 2011), finding no evidence of effect with
cholinesterase inhibitor use compared to placebo (RR 0.95, 95%
CI 0.49 to 1.87, I2 = 0%; 96 participants; low-quality evidence,
downgraded due to risk of bias and imprecision) (Analysis 2.6).
c. Adverse outcomes
Adverse events were reported in two studies in different formats.
Sampson 2007 reported the mean adverse events in each group
and found no evidence of difference in occurrence between groups
(MD 0.13, 95% CI -0.26 to 0.52; 33 participants; low-qual-
ity evidence due to risk of bias and imprecision) (Analysis 2.7).
Marcantonio 2011 reported adverse events as a binary outcome
and found a higher rate of adverse events in the cholinesterase
inhibitor group compared to placebo (RR 6.25, 95% CI 0.35 to
112.52; 16 participants; low-quality evidence downgraded two
levels due to serious imprecision) (Analysis 2.8).
3. Antipsychotics versus placebo
Three studies investigated the effect of antipsychotic medication in
the prevention of delirium (Fukata 2014; Kalisvaart 2005; Larsen
2010). A ’Summaryof findings’ table forkeyoutcomesis presented
in Summary of findings 3.
a. Primary outcome
Two large studies evaluated antipsychotic medication versus
placebo in elderly orthopaedic patients and one smaller study
assessed those undergoing abdominal or orthopaedic surgery.
Kalisvaart 2005 assessed oral haloperidol, a first generation (typi-
cal) antipsychotic preparation in 430 participants; data were avail-
able for 395 participants for available case analysis. Fukata 2014
22
Interventions for preventing delirium in hospitalised non-ICU patients (Review)

 administered prophylactic intravenous haloperidol to 121 patients
from postoperative days one to three.Larsen 2010 tested oral olan-
zapine, a second generation (atypical) antipsychotic in 495 partic-
ipants, with data for available case analysis for 400.
Pooled analysis of all three studies was inconclusive regarding an
effect of antipsychotic treatment on incident delirium, but there
wasmoderate heterogeneitybetweenthe studies(RR0.73, 95%CI
0.33 to 1.59, I2= 90%; 916 participants; very low-quality evidence
due to risk of bias, imprecision and inconsistency) (Analysis 3.1;
Figure 5).
Figure 5.
Forest plot of comparison: 3 Prophylactic antipsychotic versus control, outcome: 3.1 Incidence of
delirium.
Subgroup analysis
The pre-planned subgroup analysis assessed the effect of typi-
cal and atypical antipsychotics separately on delirium incidence.
There was no evidence of effect of haloperidol on delirium inci-
dence (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.60, I2= 43%; two studies; 516
participants; low-quality evidence downgraded due to risk of bias
and inconsistency). However, the risk of incident delirium was
lower with olanzapine than with placebo (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.24
to 0.52; one study; 400 participants; moderate-quality evidence
due to risk of bias) (Figure 5).
b. Secondary outcomes
All three studies reported duration of delirium episodes. However,
Fukata 2014 present mean duration data without a standard de-
viation so they could not be included in the quantitative analysis.
Between the other two studies there was serious heterogeneity in
duration findings. Haloperidol showed a large effect size, with a
shorter duration of delirium in the intervention group compared
to control (MD -6.40 days, 95% CI -9.38 to -3.42; one study; 68
participants). Olanzapine showed a longer duration for the inter-
vention group (MD 0.60 days, 95% CI 0.10 to 1.10; one study;
110 participants). The pooled analysis of both showed a mean
difference in delirium duration between intervention and control
groups of -2.74 days (95% CI -9.59 to 4.11, I2 = 95%; 178 partic-
ipants; very low-quality evidence due to serious imprecision and
inconsistency) (Analysis 3.2).
Both Kalisvaart 2005 and Larsen 2010 reported severity of delir-
ium episodes, although there was serious heterogeneity between
studies as before. Haloperidol showed a large effect size, with a
reduction in severity of delirium in the intervention group com-
pared to control (MD -4.00, 95% CI -5.86 to -2.14; 68 partici-
23

 pants). Olanzapine showed an increased severity for the interven-
tion group (MD 1.90, 95% CI 0.41 to 3.39; 110 participants).
Pooled analysis showed no evidence of effect in delirium severity
with antipsychotic treatment (MD -1.02, 95% CI -6.80 to 4.76,
I2 = 96%; 178 participants; very low-quality evidence due to seri-
ous imprecision and inconsistency) (Analysis 3.3).
Length of admission was only reported in one study (Kalisvaart
2005), which showed a mean difference of -5.50 days for haloperi-
dol compared to placebo (95% CI -12.17 to 1.17; 68 participants;
low-quality evidence, downgraded two levels due to serious im-
precision in results (Analysis 3.4).
Cognitive testing, using MMSE (Folstein 1975) was performed
on the first day of the delirium episode by Larsen 2010. Those who
received olanzapine had lower MMSE scores (poorer cognitive
function) than those treated with placebo (MD -4.90, 95% CI -
7.42to-2.38; 110participants; low-qualityevidence due to serious
imprecision) (Analysis 3.5).
There was no evidence of effect of treatment allocation on with-
drawal from protocol in pooled analysis including Kalisvaart 2005
& Larsen 2010 (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.24, I2 = 0%; 925 par-
ticipants; moderate-quality evidence due to risk of bias) (Analysis
3.6).
c. Adverse outcomes
Adverse events were reported by Kalisvaart 2005; there was no
evidence of effect of haloperidol on adverse events (RR 0.39, 95%
CI 0.10 to 1.43; 430 participants; low-quality evidence due to
risk of bias and imprecision) (Analysis 3.7). Larsen 2010 report
data on the occurrence of pneumonia (RR 7.28, 95% CI 0.38 to
140.11; 400 participants), urinary tract infection (RR 0.26, 95%
CI 0.03 to 2.31; 400 participants) and congestive heart failure
(RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.07 to 16.52; 400 participants) and there
was no evidence of effect of olanzapine on the risk of developing
these adverse events (Very low-quality evidence, downgraded due
to risk of bias and serious imprecision) (Analysis 3.8; Analysis 3.9;
Analysis 3.10).
4. Melatonin or melatonin agonists versus placebo
Three studies investigated the effect of melatonin or melatonin
agonists in the prevention of delirium (Al-Aama 2011; de Jonghe
2014; Hatta 2014). Outcome data relevant to this review were
obtained from the authors of Hatta 2014 for 43 participants who
were cared for in acute medical wards rather than ICU. A ’Sum-
mary of findings’ table for key outcomes is presented in Summary
of findings 4.
a. Primary outcome
All three studies reported the primary outcome, delirium inci-
dence. The pooled analysis showed no evidence of effect of mela-
tonin on incident delirium (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.89 I2 =
78%; 529 participants; very low-quality evidence due to risk of
bias, imprecision and inconsistency) (Analysis 4.1; Figure 6).
Figure 6.
Forest plot of comparison: 4 Prophylactic melatonin versus placebo, outcome: 4.1 Incident
delirium.
b. Secondary outcomes
Duration of delirium was only reported in one study (de Jonghe
2014). There was no evidence of a difference between melatonin
and placebo groups in delirium duration (MD 0.00, 95% CI -0.57
to 0.57; 104 participants; moderate-quality evidence downgraded
due to imprecision) (Analysis 4.2) .
Severity of delirium was reported in all three studies but each
in a different way. de Jonghe 2014 reported delirium severity
as a binary outcome, severe or not severe (defined as >= 3 mg
haloperidol administered during delirium episode). There was no
evidence of a difference between melatonin and placebo groups

 in the occurrence of severe delirium (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.58 to
1.27; 104 participants; moderate-quality evidence due to impre-
cision) (Analysis 4.3) Al-Aama 2011 reported delirium severity
using MDAS (Breitbart 1997), however their results include those
with prevalent as well as incident delirium and have not been in-
cluded in the quantitative summary. Hatta 2014 reported delirium
severity using the DRS-R-98 (Trzepacz 2001). There appeared to
be a reduction in delirium severity in those receiving the melatonin
agonist (RR -4.10, 95% CI -19.47 to 11.27; six participants), but
the evidence was of low quality, downgraded two levels due to
serious imprecision (Analysis 4.4).
Length of admission was reported in two studies, and there was
no evidence of difference in admission duration between interven-
tion and control groups (MD 0.09 days, 95% CI -1.20 to 1.39
days, I2 = 0%; 500 participants; moderate-quality evidence due to
imprecision) (Analysis 4.5).
de Jonghe 2014 assessed cognitive impairment using the Charl-
son index (Charlson 1994), IQCODE (Jorm 1989) and MMSE
(Folstein 1975) at three-month follow-up. It appeared that those
in the melatonin group had a lower risk of cognitive impairment,
compared to those receiving placebo (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.70 to
1.04; 378 participants). However, this evidence was of moder-
ate quality due to imprecision of the result from a single study
(Analysis 4.6).
There was no evidence of difference in performance of activities of
daily living, using the Katz index (Katz 1970), in those receiving
melatonin found by de Jonghe 2014 (MD 0.00, 95%CI -1.20
to 1.20; 369 participants; moderate-quality evidence downgraded
due to imprecision) (Analysis 4.7).
Al-Aama 2011 examinedratesof psychotropicmedicationuse,and
reported a high proportion of participants in both melatonin and
control groups were prescribed these drugs (33/61 in melatonin
group and 38/61 in the placebo group). There was no evidence
of a difference in use, however, between groups (RR 0.87, 95%
CI 0.64 to 1.18; 122 participants; moderate-quality evidence due
to imprecision) (Analysis 4.8). de Jonghe 2014 reported use of
anti-psychotic medications and benzodiazepines on a cumulative
basis, looking at mean consumption of each drug class. There
was evidence of reduced use of both anti-psychotic medications
(MD -1.00 mg, 95% CI -1.79 to -0.21 mg; 378 participants;
moderate-quality evidence downgraded as from a single study)
and benzodiazepines (MD -11.60 mg, 95% CI -24.34 to 1.14
mg; 378 participants). However, in the case of benzodiazepine
use the evidence was of low quality, downgraded due to serious
imprecision (Analysis 4.9; Analysis 4.10).
Al-Aama 2011 and Hatta 2014 also compared withdrawals from
the study and found no evidence of a difference between melatonin
and placebo groups (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.15 to 6.87; 165 partici-
pants; low-quality evidence, due to serious imprecision) (Analysis
4.11).
c. Adverse events
In-hospital mortality was reported in all three studies and mortal-
ity at three months only by de Jonghe 2014. There was no evidence
of effect on mortality rates with melatonin compared to placebo at
either time-period: In-hospital mortality (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.37
to 1.88, I2 = 0%; 543 participants; low-quality evidence due to
imprecision and low event rate) (Analysis 4.12) and three-month
mortality (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.45; 378 participants; mod-
erate-quality evidence, downgraded due to imprecision) (Analysis
4.13).
Hatta 2014 reported adverse events and there were none reported
in either group.
5. Citicoline versus placebo
One study tested the use of citicoline (Diaz 2001).
a. Primary outcome
The incidence of delirium was lower in the group treated with
citicoline, but the results were too imprecise to allow a conclusion
to be drawn (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.22 to 2.06; 80 participants;
moderate-quality evidence) (Analysis 5.1).
b. Secondary outcomes
There was no clear evidence of effect on cognitive status with
citicoline treatment using MMSE score (MD -1.47, CI -3.85 to
0.91; 81participants; moderate-qualityevidence, downgradeddue
to imprecision) (Analysis 5.2).
c. Adverse outcomes
No data were reported for adverse outcomes.
6. Oral premedication with diazepam and
diphenhydramine versus no premedication
One study of 49 participants undergoing inpatient elective car-
diac catheterisation compared the effect of premedication with
diazepam and diphenhydramine with no premedication (Ashraf
2015).
a. Primary outcome
There were no cases of incident delirium in either group (49 par-
ticipants; low-quality evidence, downgraded due to risk of bias
and evidence from single small study).
b. Secondary outcomes
No data are reported on secondary outcomes.

 c. Adverse outcomes
No data are reported on adverse outcomes.
7. Intravenous (IV) methylprednisolone versus
placebo
One large multicentre study of 7507 participants undergoing car-
diopulmonary bypass procedures who were at high risk of morbid-
ity and mortality compared the effect of intravenous (IV) methyl-
prednisolone versus placebo and incorporated incidence of delir-
ium as a safety outcome (Whitlock 2015).
a. Primary outcome
IV Methylprednisolone has no effect on the incidence of delirium
for patients undergoing high-risk cardiopulmonary bypass proce-
dures (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.19; 7507 participants; high-
quality evidence) (Analysis 7.1).
b. Secondary outcomes
IV methylprednisolone has no effect on the length of stay for
patients undergoing high-risk cardiopulmonary bypass procedures
(RR 0.00, 95% CI -0.20 to 0.20; 7507 participants; high-quality
evidence) (Analysis 7.2).
c. Adverse outcomes
IV methylprednisolone has no effect on 30-day mortality for pa-
tients undergoing high-risk cardiopulmonary bypass procedures
(RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.07; 7507 participants; high-quality
evidence) (Analysis 7.3).
Evaluating postoperative complications, IV methylprednisolone
appears to increase the risk of myocardial injury compared to
placebo (RR 1.22, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.38; 7507 participants; high-
quality evidence) and has no effect on the risk of respiratory failure
(RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.05; 7507 participants; high-quality
evidence) and infection (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.06; 7507
participants; high-quality evidence).
8. Gabapentinoids versus placebo
Twostudiestestedgabapentinoidsagents. One assessedgabapentin
in 21 patients (Leung 2006), and the other tested the more potent
preparation, pregabalin, in 70 patients (Pesonen 2011). However,
results for these studies could not be pooled as each measured
different outcomes.
a. Primary outcome
In Leung 2006, the incidence of delirium was lower in the group
treated with gabapentin, but the results were too imprecise to allow
a conclusion to be drawn (RR 0.12, 95% CI 0.01 to 1.90; 21
participants; low-quality evidence, downgraded due to risk of bias
and imprecision) (Analysis 8.1).
Pesonen 2011 tested for postoperative delirium using a Finnish
modified CAM-ICU but reported only median scores, precluding
use of these data in the analysis .
b. Secondary outcomes
Pesonen 2011 reported effect of pregabalin compared to placebo
on length of hospital admission (MD -0.60 days 95% CI -2.12
to 0.92; 60 participants) (Analysis 8.2); cognition (measured with
the CAM-ICU on day five), (MD 1.00 95% CI -2.76 to 4.76; 60
participants) (Analysis 8.3); and use of psychotropic medication,
(RR 0.53 95% CI 0.21 to 1.38; 60 participants) (Analysis 8.4).
For all three outcomes, results were inconclusive and we judged
the evidence to be low-quality, downgraded due to imprecision
and risk of bias.
Withdrawal from protocol appeared higher in the intervention
group; however the results were too imprecise to allow a conclusion
to be drawn (RR 9.0 95% CI 0.50 to 161.13; 70 participants; very
low-quality evidence downgraded due to risk of bias and serious
imprecision) (Analysis 8.5).
c. Adverse outcomes
No data were reported for adverse outcomes.
9. Ketamine versus placebo
One study (Urban 2008) tested the use of ketamine in 26 patients
undergoing lumbar spinal fusion.
a. Primary outcome
Rates of incident delirium appeared higher among those treated
with ketamine compared to control. However, the results are too
imprecise to allow a conclusion to be drawn (RR 2.00, 95% CI
0.21 to 19.23; 24 participants; very low-quality evidence, down-
graded due to risk of bias and serious imprecision) (Analysis 9.1).
b. Secondary outcomes
There was no evidence of effect of ketamine treatment on with-
drawals from protocol (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.07 to 14.34; 26 par-
ticipants; very low-quality evidence due to risk of bias and serious
imprecision) (Analysis 9.2).

 c. Adverse outcomes
No data were reported for adverse outcomes.
10. Intravenous (IV) parecoxib sodium analgesia
versus morphine and saline
One study of 80 participants admitted as an emergency for femoral
head replacement surgery compared administration of IV pare-
coxib 12-hourly versus IV morphine (single dose) followed by IV
saline (Li 2013).
a. Primary outcome
The incidence of delirium was lower in those receiving parecoxib
compared to those receiving morphine and saline (RR 0.50, 95%
CI 0.26 to 0.98; 80 participants; low-quality evidence due to in-
directness [as the comparison tests regular analgesia to one dose of
analgesia then placebo], risk of bias and this being a single small
study) (Analysis 10.1).
b. Secondary outcomes
Individuals receiving parecoxib had a shorter length of admission
than those receiving morphine and saline (MD -0.90 days, 95%
CI -1.58 to -0.22 days; 80 participants; low-quality evidence due
to indirectness and results from a single small study) (Analysis
10.2).
Data are presented for rates of postoperative cognitive dysfunction
(POCD) at three days, one week, three months, and six months,
with evidence of a reduction in the risk of POCD at one week (RR
0.38, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.98; 80 participants; low-quality evidence
downgraded due to indirectness, imprecision and results being
from a single small study) (Analysis 10.4).
c. Adverse outcomes
No data were reported for adverse outcomes.
11. Intrathecal morphine and patient controlled
analgesia (PCA) versus saline and PCA
One study (Beaussier 2006) tested the administration of intrathe-
cal morphine preoperatively in addition to postoperative patient-
controlled intravenous morphine for pain control in 59 patients.
Both groups received postoperative PCA, but the intervention
group were given intrathecal morphine, and the control group, a
similar volume of saline preoperatively.
a. Primary outcome
There was no evidence of effect on intrathecal and PCA morphine
on rates of incident delirium (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.85; 52
participants; low-quality evidence due to risk of bias and impreci-
sion) (Analysis 11.1).
b. Secondary outcomes
Data were presented on length of admission (MD -0.50 days,
95% CI -1.51 to 0.51; 52 participants) (Analysis 11.2); days for
cognition to return to preoperative level (MD 0.20, 95% CI -
1.03 to 1.43; 52 participants) (Analysis 11.3); and withdrawals
from protocol (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.19 to 3.17; 59 participants)
(Analysis 11.4) for intrathecal PCA morphine compared to saline
and PCA. For all these outcomes, there was no clear evidence of
effect from the intervention. We judged the evidence to be of low
quality, downgraded due to risk of bias and imprecision.
c. Adverse outcomes
Mortality appeared lower in those in the intrathecal and PCA mor-
phine group, but the results were too imprecise for any conclusions
to be drawn (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.13; 59 participants; low-
quality evidence, downgraded two levels due to serious impreci-
sion) (Analysis 11.5).
12. Fascia iliaca compartment block (FICB) versus
placebo
One study (Mouzopoulos 2009) with 219 participants tested ad-
ministration of fascia iliaca compartment block (FICB) to manage
pain in hip fracture patients assessed as being at intermediate or
high risk of delirium.
a. Primary outcome
Use of a FICB reduced the risk of incident delirium compared
to placebo (RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.87; 207 participants;
moderate-quality evidence due to risk of bias) (Analysis 12.1).
b. Secondary outcomes
Use of a FICB reduced the severity of delirium episodes (MD -
4.30, 95% CI -6.81 to -1.79; 36 participants) (Analysis 12.2) and
duration of delirium episodes (MD -5.70 days, 95% CI -9.50 to
-1.90; 36 participants) (Analysis 12.3). However, we judged the
evidence to be of very low-quality, downgraded due to risk of bias
and serious imprecision.
27

 c. Adverse outcomes
There was no evidence of effect of the intervention on risk of
mortality (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.05 to 5.58; 219 participants; low-
quality evidence downgraded two levels due to serious imprecision
(Analysis 12.4).
13. Light versus deep propofol sedation
One study compared the effect of light and deep propofol sedation
on the prevalence of postoperative delirium in 114 older adult pa-
tients who underwent hip fracture repair under spinal anaesthesia
(Sieber 2010).
a. Primary outcome
The incidence of delirium was lower in those receiving light propo-
fol sedation compared to deep propofol sedation (RR 0.48, 95%
CI 0.26 to 0.89; 114 participants; moderate-quality evidence due
to risk of bias) (Analysis 13.1).
b. Secondary outcomes
There was no clear evidence of effect of level of sedation on delir-
ium duration (MD -0.60 days, 95% CI -3.30 to 2.10; 34 partic-
ipants; very low-quality evidence due to risk of bias and serious
imprecision) (Analysis 13.2).
There was no evidence of effect on level of sedation on length
of admission (MD 0.20 days, 95% CI -0.80 to 1.20 days; 114
participants; moderate-quality evidence, downgraded due to risk
of bias) (Analysis 13.3).
Light propofol sedation improved cognitive performance (on day
two postoperatively, assessed using MMSE score (Folstein 1975))
(MD 3.10, 95% CI 0.30 to 5.90; 114 participants; moderate-
quality evidence due to risk of bias) (Analysis 13.4).
c. Adverse outcomes
There was no evidence of effect of level of sedation on inpatient
mortality (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.05, to 5.36; 114 participants; low-
quality evidence downgraded two levels due to serious impreci-
sion) (Analysis 13.5). There was no evidence of effect of the inter-
vention on the risk of experiencing >=1 postoperative complica-
tion (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.26; 114 participants; low-quality
evidence due to risk of bias and imprecision) (Analysis 13.6).
14. Bispectral index (BIS)-guided anaesthesia versus
BIS-blinded anaesthesia or clinical judgement
Three studies Chan 2013 (925 participants), Radtke 2013 (1277
participants) and Gauge 2014 (81 participants) investigated the
use of BIS in anaesthesia. Only two of these presented useable data
for inclusion in the review (Chan 2013; Radtke 2013) as insuffi-
cient data were reported in Gauge 2014 (conference abstract). A
summary of findings for key outcomes is presented in Summary
of findings 5.
a. Primary outcome
BIS-guided anaesthesia was effective in reducing incident delirium
(RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.85, I2 = 0%; 2057 participants;
moderate-quality evidence due to risk of bias) (Analysis 14.1;
Figure 7).
Figure 7.
Forest plot of comparison: 11 Bispectral index (BIS)-guided anaesthesia versus BIS-blinded
anaesthesia, outcome: 11.1 Incident delirium.
b. Secondary outcomes
BIS-guided anaesthesia resulted in a shorter length of admission
than those receiving BIS-blinded anaesthesia/clinical judgement
(MD -0.94 days, 95% CI -1.45 to -0.43 days, I2 = 0%; 2057
participants; moderate-quality evidence, downgraded due to risk
of bias) (Analysis 14.2).
Use of BIS-guided anaesthesia showed evidence of reducing rates
28

 of cognitive impairment at seven days (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.71
to 1.05, I2 = 0%; 1938 participants) (Analysis 14.3) and at three
months (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.97; 1990 participants) (
Analysis 14.4). However, we considered the evidence to be of low
quality, downgraded due to risk of bias and imprecision.
c. Adverse outcomes
Chan 2013 reported SF-36 mental summary scores (Ware 1992) at
follow-up and the BIS-guided group had lower scores, indicating
a poorer assessment of their own mental health (MD -1.90, 95%
CI -3.40 to -0.40; 902 participants; moderate-quality evidence
downgraded as from a single study) (Analysis 14.5).
One study reported mortality at seven days (Chan 2013); there
was no clear evidence of any effect on mortality (RR 1.49, 95% CI
0.42 to 5.25; 921 participants; low-quality evidence, downgraded
two levels due to serious imprecision) (Analysis 14.6).
Two studies reported mortality at three months (Chan 2013;
Radtke 2013); there was no evidence of reduction in mortality (RR
1.10, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.59, I2 = 0%; 1938 participants; moderate-
quality evidence due to imprecision) (Analysis 14.7).
Chan 2013 reported rates of cardiac, respiratory and infectious
adverse events. There was no evidence of a reduction in cardiac
(RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.39; 902 participants) or respiratory
adverse events (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.07; 902 participants),
but infectious adverse events were lower in the group receiving
BIS-guided anaesthesia (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.95; 902 par-
ticipants). However, the evidence was deemed of low quality due
to risk of bias and being from a single study.
15. Sevoflurane versus propofol anaesthesia
Lurati 2012 compared sevoflurane, an inhalational anaesthetic
versus propofol, an intravenous anaesthetic to reduce periopera-
tive myocardial ischaemia in 385 patients undergoing noncardiac
surgery.
a. Primary outcome
There was no evidence of effect on rates of incident delirium with
sevoflurane anaesthesia compared to propofol anaesthesia (RR
0.79, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.34; 385 participants; low-quality evidence
downgraded due to risk of bias and imprecision) (Analysis 15.1).
b. Secondary outcomes
No data were reported for secondary outcomes.
c. Adverse outcomes
There was no evidence of a difference in mortality at 12 months
between intervention and control groups (RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.70
to 2.02; 385 participants; low-quality evidence downgraded two
levels due to serious imprecision) (Analysis 15.2).
16. Xenon versus sevoflurane anaesthesia
Stoppe 2013 conducted a pilot trial to determine the feasibility
and safety of xenon, a novel anaesthetic gas with neuroprotective
and cardioprotective properties compared with sevoflurane a con-
ventional inhalational anaesthetic in 30 patients undergoing elec-
tive coronary artery bypass grafting.
a. Primary outcome
There was no evidence of a difference in incidence of postoperative
delirium between the xenon and sevoflurane groups. The highest
incidence of delirium occurred on the second postoperative day
(RR 0.75, 95% 0.20 to 2.79; 30 participants; very low-quality
evidence due to risk of bias and serious imprecision) (Analysis
16.1).
b. Secondary outcomes
Hospital admission appeared to be longer in those treated with
xenon, but the results were too imprecise to allow conclusions
to be drawn (MD 4.00 days, 95% CI -1.72 to 9.72 days; 30
participants; very low-quality evidence, downgraded due to risk
of bias and serious imprecision) (Analysis 16.2).
c. Adverse outcomes
There were no in-hospital deaths amongst study participants
(Analysis 16.3). There was no evidence of effect on adverse events
(RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.64; 30 participants; low-quality ev-
idence downgraded due to risk of bias and imprecision) or the
incidence of sepsis (RR 1.50, 95% CI 0.29 to 7.73; 30 partici-
pants; very low-quality evidence downgraded due to risk of bias
and serious imprecision) (Analysis 16.4; Analysis 16.5).
17. Epidural anaesthesia versus general anaesthesia
Two studies compared epidural versus general anaesthesia (
Berggren 1987; Papaioannou 2005).
a. Primary outcome
We pooled data from both studies for the primary outcome of
incident delirium, but the result was too imprecise to determine an
effect (RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.69 to 2.03, I2 = 0%; 104 participants;
very low-quality evidence downgraded due to risk of bias and
serious imprecision) (Analysis 17.1).
29
Interventions for preventing delirium in hospitalised non-ICU patients (Review)

 b. Secondary outcomes
There was no evidence of reduction in admission length, evaluated
as those with a length of stay >10 days versus not (RR 0.59, 95%
CI 0.28 to 1.24; 47 participants) (Analysis 17.2) and cognitive
decline (MD0.15, 95%CI0.02 to 1.06;47 participants)(Analysis
17.3) from one study (Papaioannou 2005). For both outcomes
the result was inconclusive and we judged the evidence to be low
quality, downgraded due to risk of bias and imprecision.
c. Adverse outcomes
Berggren 1987 examined physical morbidity and found no evi-
dence of reduction in urinary tract infection (MD 1.33, 95% CI
0.57 to 3.09; 57 participants) and psychological morbidity (de-
pression) (RR 1.04; 95% CI 0.23 to 4.71; 57 participants). The
evidence for both outcomes was of low quality downgraded two
levels due to serious imprecision of results) (Analysis 17.4; Analysis
17.5).
There was no evidence for reduction in postoperative compli-
cations using epidural versus general anaesthesia reported by
Papaioannou 2005 (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.35 to 2.39; 47 partic-
ipants; very low-quality evidence due to risk of bias and serious
imprecision) (Analysis 17.6).
Berggren 1987 investigated the impact on pressure ulcers and re-
ported no evidence of effect of reduction in pressure ulcer forma-
tion between epidural and general anaesthesia groups (RR 0.62,
95% CI 0.16 to 2.36; 57 participants; low-quality evidence down-
graded two levels due to serious imprecision) (Analysis 17.7).
18. Liberal versus restrictive blood transfusion
thresholds
One study Gruber-Baldini 2013 with 139 participants compared
the use of liberal versus restrictive blood transfusion thresholds for
individuals undergoing surgical repair of hip fracture. There was
significant overlap in the volume of blood received by participants
in the liberal and restrictive groups.
a. Primary outcome
There was no evidence to support liberal transfusion thresholds
on rates of incident delirium (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.27;
108 participants; moderate-quality evidence due to risk of bias)
(Analysis 18.1).
b. Secondary outcomes
There was no evidence that liberal transfusion thresholds affected
the severity of delirium (MD -0.10 points, 95% CI -2.99 to 2.79;
38 participants; low-quality evidence due to risk of bias and im-
precision) or length of admission (MD -0.10 days, 95% CI -1.36
to 1.16 days; 138 participants; low-quality evidence downgraded
due to imprecision and risk of bias) (Analysis 18.2; Analysis 18.3).
Use of psychoactive medication appeared balanced between the
liberal and restrictive transfusion groups (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.87
to 1.12; 138 participants; low-quality evidence downgraded due
to risk of bias and as results from a single small study) (Analysis
18.4).
c. Adverse outcomes
Data were reported on the occurrence of post-randomisation ad-
verse events, specifically infections and congestive heart failure.
There was no evidence that liberal transfusions reduced the risk of
infections (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.23 to 5.22; 138 participants; very
low-quality evidence downgraded due to risk of bias and serious
imprecision) or congestive heart failure (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.05 to
5.88; 138 participants; very low-quality evidence downgraded due
to risk of bias and serious imprecision) (Analysis 18.5; Analysis
18.6).
19. Fast-track surgery versus usual care
One study Jia 2014 with 240 participants evaluated the effects of
fast-track surgery for older adults with colorectal cancer compared
to usual care.
a. Primary outcome
Evidence from this study supports fast-track surgery as an inter-
vention to reduce incident delirium (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.09 to
0.77; 233 participants; low-quality evidence, downgraded due to
imprecision of results and risk of bias) (Analysis 19.1).
b. Secondary outcomes
There is evidence to support fast-track surgery in reducing length
of admission (MD -4.20 days, 95% CI -4.60 to -3.80 days; 233
participants; high-quality evidence) (Analysis 19.2).
c. Adverse outcomes
The study reports on the occurrence of urinary tract infection and
heart failure. It appeared that fast-track surgery reduced the rate
of urinary tract infection (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.04), but
this was low-quality evidence as the result was too imprecise to
draw a conclusion and there was risk of bias in outcome assessment
(Analysis 19.3). There is evidence to support fast-track surgery
reducing the occurrence of heart failure compared to usual care
(RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.91; 233 participants; low-quality
evidence downgradeddue toriskof biasand imprecision)(Analysis
19.4)

 20. Postoperative delirium-free protocol (DFP) versus
usual care
One small study Aizawa 2002 with 42 participants evaluated a
’delirium-free protocol’ which was comprised of overnight infu-
sions of diazepam, flunitrazepam and pethidine to older postop-
erative surgical patients.
a. Primary outcome
DFP use was associated with a lower rate of incident delirium,
but the result was imprecise (RR 0.14, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.06; 40
participants; low-quality evidence downgraded due to risk of bias
and imprecision) (Analysis 20.1).
b. Secondary outcomes
There was no evidence of effect of the DFP on length of admission
(MD -4.30 days, 95% CI -12.51 to 3.91 days; 40 participants;
very low-quality evidence, downgraded due to risk of bias and
serious imprecision) (Analysis 20.2).
There was no evidence of effect of the DFP on the risk of be-
havioural disturbance (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.03 to 1.56; 40 partic-
ipants; low-quality evidence, downgraded due to risk of bias and
imprecision) (Analysis 20.3).
c. Adverse outcomes
No data were reported for adverse outcomes.
21. Computerised clinical decision support system
(CCDSS) versus usual care
One study Boustani 2012 assessed the use of a computerised clini-
cal decision support system (CCDSS) on the management of 427
older adults with cognitive impairment compared to usual care.
a. Primary outcome
There was no evidence of the effect of CCDSS in reducing inci-
dent delirium (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.43; 424 participants;
moderate-quality evidence due to risk of bias) (Analysis 21.1).
b. Secondary outcomes
There was no evidence of reduction in the length of admission
(MD 0.90 days, 95% CI -0.35 to 2.15 days; 424 participants;
low-quality evidence, downgraded due to serious imprecision) (
Analysis 21.2).
c. Adverse outcomes
There was no evidence of a change in rates of mortality within 30
daysof discharge (RR1.04, 95%CI 0.49 to 2.23;424 participants;
low-quality evidence downgraded due to serious imprecision) (
Analysis 21.3).
There was no evidence of effect on rates of falls (RR 0.93, 95%
CI 0.39 to 2.19; 424 participants) or pressure ulcers (RR 1.09,
95% CI 0.64 to 1.84; 424 participants) with use of the CCDSS
with moderate-quality evidence downgraded due to imprecision.
(Analysis 21.4; Analysis 21.5)
22. Geriatric unit care versus orthopaedic unit care
One trial of 329 older adults following hip fracture compared care
in a specialist geriatric unit and comprehensive geriatric assessment
to care in their orthopaedic unit (Watne 2014).
a. Primary outcome
There was no evidence that care in the geriatric unit reduced the
incidence of delirium compared to care in the orthopaedic unit
(RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.22; 329 participants; low-quality
evidence downgradeddue toriskof biasand imprecision)(Analysis
22.1).
b. Secondary outcomes
There was no evidence that care in the geriatric unit reduced the
duration (MD -1.00 days, 95% CI -2.04 to 0.04 days; 163 partic-
ipants) (Analysis 22.2) or severity of delirium episodes (MD 1.50
points, 95% CI -1.00 to 4.00 points; 163 participants) (Analysis
22.3) compared to the orthopaedic unit, low-quality evidence for
both outcomes, downgraded due to risk of bias and imprecision.
Care in the geriatric unit increased length of hospital admission by
a mean of three days (RR 3.00, 95% CI 1.94 to 4.06 days; mod-
erate-quality evidence downgraded due to risk of bias) compared
to the orthopaedic unit (Analysis 22.4).
Outcome assessments at four and 12 months were conducted
blinded to original allocation, unlike those conducted while in
hospital.
There was no evidence that care in the geriatric unit affected cog-
nitive function (using a composite score) at four months follow-
up (MD 1.80 points, 95% CI -5.92 to 9.52 points; 228 partici-
pants; low-quality evidence downgraded two levels due to serious
imprecision) (Analysis 22.5). Care in the geriatric unit appeared
to increase the rate of incident dementia at 12 months (RR 2.26,
95% CI 0.60 to 8.49; 193 participants) (Analysis 22.6), however,
the evidence was deemed to be of low quality and was downgraded
two levels due to serious imprecision.
There was no evidence that activities of daily living (measured by
Barthel Index (Mahoney 1965)) were affected by allocation to the
geriatric unit or the orthopaedic unit (MD 1.00, 95% CI -0.70 to
31

 2.70; moderate-quality evidence downgraded due to imprecision)
(Analysis 22.7).
There was no evidence that care in the geriatric unit affected risk
of Institutionalisation at four (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.91;
242 participants; moderate-quality evidence downgraded due to
imprecision) (Analysis 22.8) and 12 months (RR 0.86, 95% CI
0.47 to 1.59; 193 participants; moderate-quality evidence down-
graded due to imprecision) (Analysis 22.9).
c. Adverse outcomes
There was no evidence that care in the geriatric unit improved
the rate of in-hospital mortality (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.47;
329 participants; moderate-quality evidence downgraded due to
imprecision) compared to the orthopaedic unit (Analysis 22.10).
Evaluating other adverse outcomes there was no evidence that care
in the geriatric unit reduced the rate of falls (RR 1.30, 95% CI
0.61 to 2.77; 329 participants) (Analysis 22.11); pressure ulcer
formation (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.10 to 1.41; 329 participants) (
Analysis 22.12); other medical adverse events (RR 0.96, 95% CI
0.76 to 1.23; 329 participants) (Analysis 22.13); or postoperative
complications (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.20 to 2.36; 329 participants)
(Analysis 22.14) with low-quality evidence for each comparison,
downgraded due to risk of bias and imprecision.

Summary of main results
Evidence for the effectiveness of most interventions for preventing
delirium remains uncertain, with the exception of multi-compo-
nent interventions.
Multi-component interventions
There is moderate-quality evidence from seven randomised con-
trolled trials that multi-component interventions reduce delirium
incidence, with an overall reduction in the risk of delirium by
about 30% compared with usual care. Moreover, they appear to
have similar effect sizes in medical and surgical study populations.
Despite the higher risk of delirium in patients with dementia,
only one trial reported data on the incidence of delirium in this
subgroup (for 50 participants); and in this study, dementia preva-
lence was unbalanced between intervention and control groups
(Marcantonio 2001). The effectiveness of these interventions in
patients with dementia remains uncertain.
Effects on delirium duration, length of hospital admission, insti-
tutionalisation and severity of delirium are also uncertain. There
is no clear evidence of effect on mortality (either inpatient, or at
12 months); 12-month mortality was only reported in one trial
(Lundstrom 2007). Clinically important differences are reported
for cognition (in one study; 60 participants, Bonaventura 2007)
and pressure ulcers (two studies; 457 participants, Hempenius
2013; Lundstrom 2007), all in a direction favouring multi-com-
ponent interventions, although there is uncertainty in these results
due to imprecision.
Pharmacological interventions
Cholinesterase inhibitors
We foundnoclearevidence of benefitforacholinesterase inhibitor,
donepezil, in preventing delirium in an elective orthopaedic pop-
ulation without cognitive impairment. The available evidence was
judged to be very low-quality due to imprecision and considerable
inconsistency.
Antipsychotic medication
Overall, there is no clear evidence for effectiveness of antipsychotic
medications as a group in delirium prevention, although there is
uncertainty in this result because of imprecision and inconsistency.
The pre-planned subgroup analysis indicates that an atypical an-
tipsychotic drug (olanzapine) may reduce incidence of delirium,
with a potentially large effect size, but there is no clear evidence
supporting effectiveness of the typical antipsychotic, haloperidol.
However, it is possible that in one study of haloperidol, optimisa-
tion of non-pharmacological delirium prevention in both the in-
tervention and control arms precluded detection of any additional
benefit from medication. In the other study, haloperidol was ad-
ministered on the first postoperative day for three days and this
may have been too late for any preventive benefits, although this
study was also at high risk of bias due its unblinded nature.
The impact on severity and duration of delirium also differed be-
tween two studies of haloperidol and olanzapine, but paradox-
ically, favoured the intervention group for haloperidol, and the
control group for olanzapine. There is no clear evidence for effect
of antipsychotic medication on length of hospital admission.
Melatonin
There is no clear evidence to support effectiveness of melatonin
or melatonin agonists in delirium prevention. However, there is
considerable heterogeneity in results, which may have been a re-
sult of differing study populations and different dosages. Al-Aama
2011 reported a clinically important effect size in reducing delir-
ium incidence in medical inpatients using 0.5 mg melatonin daily,
(low-quality evidence because of incomplete follow-up); whilst de
Jonghe 2014 reported no effect using melatonin 3 mg daily in hip
fracture patients undergoing acute surgery. Ramelteon, a mela-
tonin agonist, has previously been proposed as a safer treatment for
insomnia (Miyamoto 2009), but we found no evidence of benefit
in delirium prevention in one trial.
Other pharmacological interventions
We found no evidence to support effectiveness of citicoline in
reducing delirium incidence.
Methylprednisolone had no effect on delirium incidence.
In one small trial of premedication using diazepam and diphen-
hydramine for elective inpatient cardiac catheterisation there were
no cases of delirium in either group; thus the evidence that choice
of premedication affects delirium incidence remains inconclusive.
Perioperative interventions
Opioid-sparing measures
The evidence about the effect of gabapentin, ketamine or intrathe-
cal and patient controlled analgesia (PCA) morphine for delirium
prevention is inconclusive.
There was evidence that intravenous (IV) parecoxib reduced the
incidence of delirium compared to morphine and saline. However,
the evidence was of low quality, from a single study and affected
by potential confounding related to the administration of supple-
mentary morphine.
There is evidence that fascia iliaca compartment block (FICB)
to manage pain in hip fracture patients is effective in reducing
incidence of delirium. Lower-quality evidence also suggested that
it could reduce the severity and length of delirium episodes.

 Reducing/controlling the depth of anaesthesia
Reduction in depth of general anaesthesia or controlling the depth
is effective in preventing delirium. Both use of light propofol seda-
tion compared to deep, and Bispectral index (BIS)-guided anaes-
thesia compared to BIS-blinded anaesthesia/clinical judgement
were effective approaches.
Changing the mode of anaesthesia
There is no evidence of difference in effect on delirium incidence
of using propofol or xenon compared to sevoflurane anaesthesia.
Avoiding general anaesthesia
The evidence for effectiveness of epidural anaesthesia compared
to general anaesthesia in delirium prevention is uncertain.
Miscellaneous perioperative interventions
There was no evidence from one study that liberal versus restrictive
blood transfusion was effective in preventing delirium.
One study of fast-track surgery in elderlycancer patients suggested
that it reduces the incidence of delirium and length of hospital
admission.
One study which used a ’delirium-free protocol’ for older adults
undergoing open laparotomy is likely to have resulted in sedation
of participants and failed to demonstrate any evidence of benefit
on delirium incidence.
Computerised clinical decision support system (CCDSS)
One study using a computerised clinical decision support system
conducted in general and geriatric medical patients did not result
in improvement in delirium incidence.
Geriatric unit care versus orthopaedic unit
There was no evidence that care in the geriatric medicine unit re-
duced the incidence duration or severity of delirium or other cog-
nitive and functional outcomes. However, geriatric unit care in-
creased length of hospital stay compared to care in the orthopaedic
unit.
Overall completeness and applicability of
evidence
Although 39 trials were identified for inclusion in this review, the
body of evidence for delirium prevention in hospitalised non-ICU
patients remains limited, except for multi-component interven-
tions (seven trials). Most other interventions were only investi-
gated in one or two small trials, with considerable heterogeneity
in the interventions, outcomes, populations and settings studied,
precluding meta-analyses. Only one study (of a multi-component
intervention in surgical patients) presented results for people with
dementia, an important subgroup to study in delirium prevention.
The effectiveness of delirium interventions might be expected to
differ given the higher prevalence of delirium and poorer outcomes
in dementia.
For multi-component interventions, it is likely that the included
trials and meta-analyses were underpowered to detect mortality
and institutionalisation (both relatively rare outcomes), and this
may explain the lack of observed impact on these endpoints, de-
spite the reduction in incident delirium.
Although there was evidence suggesting FICB, controlling depth
of anaesthesia and fast-track surgery could reduce postoperative
delirium incidence, it is important to note that in clinical prac-
tice, there will be a range of considerations apart from effective-
ness in delirium prevention (including co-morbidities, falls risk,
and rehabilitation requirements) guiding choice of approaches to
surgery and anaesthesia. Recommendations regarding surgery and
anaesthetic practice cannot, therefore, be made based on the evi-
dence from this review alone.
Most studies included delirium incidence as an outcome, and both
cognition and length of hospital admission were also frequently
reported. However, other important outcomes including delirium
duration and severity, mortality, institutionalisation, activities of
daily living (ADL) performance, and adverse outcomes were not
commonly reported. No studies investigated the impact on qual-
ity of life, carers’ psychological morbidity, staff psychological mor-
bidity, or costs. Future studies need to address these gaps in the
interventions, settings and outcomes studied.
Failure to exclude prevalent delirium at enrolment was a common
limitation of the majority of included studies (29/39). This has the
potential to reduce precision in the results as interventions cannot
prevent cases of delirium already present in recruited participants.
Quality of the evidence
We used GRADEpro software (GRADEpro 2014) to inform the
generation of evidence quality statements for five comparisons: i)
multi-componentinterventionsversususual care; ii)cholinesterase
inhibitors versus placebo; iii) antipsychotic medication versus
placebo; iv) melatonin versus placebo and v) BIS-guided versus
BIS-blinded anaesthesia/clinical judgement. Full tabulations for
each outcome are available in: Summary of findings for the main
comparison, Summary of findings 2, Summary of findings 3,
Summary of findings 4 and Summary of findings 5.
On the basis of seven randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (four
in medical patients and three in surgical patients) n = 1950 par-
ticipants, there is moderate-quality evidence that multi-compo-
nent delirium prevention interventions can reduce rates of inci-
dent delirium; this is consistent across the included trials. Evidence
has been downgraded due to the possibility of performance bias
(the nature of the intervention precludes blinding of participants
and those delivering intervention). Outcome assessors were un-
43

 blinded to the intervention in two studies, including the study
with the largest weighting and highest event rate. Furthermore,
there is a risk of other bias in two of the included studies due to an
imbalance between the intervention and control groups in respect
to the prevalence of pre-existing dementia.
Heterogeneity in the multi-component interventions studied
makes it difficult to ascertain whether specific components of the
interventions are particularly effective in the prevention of delir-
ium.
There is moderate-quality evidence that multi-component inter-
ventions have no effect on length of hospital stay (six studies, n
= 1920 participants) and moderate-quality evidence of no effect
on the likelihood of return to independent living (four studies, n
= 1116). There is considerable uncertainty regarding the effect of
multi-component interventions on the duration of delirium due
to unblinded outcome assessment in two studies, imbalance in the
prevalence of dementia in two studies and imprecise results.
On the basis of two RCTs (n = 113 participants), there is consider-
able uncertainty regarding the effect of prophylactic cholinesterase
inhibitors on reducing delirium incidence due to very low-quality
evidence. Both of these studies have missing outcome data; evi-
dence was downgraded due to imprecision and inconsistency in
the results. There is low-quality evidence for the effect of prophy-
lactic cholinesterase inhibitors on the outcome of delirium sever-
ity (one study; n = 16 participants) and length of admission (two
studies; n = 128 participants). Evidence was downgraded due to
serious imprecision of the delirium severity results and for impre-
cision and risk of bias in length of admission.
On the basis of three RCTs (n = 916 participants), there is con-
siderable uncertainty regarding the effect of antipsychotic medi-
cations on the incidence of delirium due to low-quality evidence
that has been downgraded because of risk of bias, inconsistency
and imprecise results. There is very low-quality evidence on the
effect of antipsychotic medications on the severity (two studies,
n = 178 participants) and duration of delirium (two studies, n
= 178 participants), and low-quality evidence on length of stay
because of inconsistent and very imprecise results (one study, n =
68 participants).
On the basis of three RCTs (n = 529 participants), there is consid-
erable uncertainty regarding the effect of prophylactic melatonin/
melatonin agonists on the incidence of delirium due to very low-
quality evidence that has been downgraded because of risk of bias,
imprecise and inconsistent results. There is moderate-quality ev-
idence that melatonin does not affect the duration of delirium,
downgraded as the results are from a single study (n = 104). There
is uncertainty regarding the effect of melatonin on severity of delir-
ium due to moderate-quality evidence from one study using a
binary outcome (n = 104) and low-quality evidence from a sec-
ond study downgraded due to serious imprecision (n = 6). There
is moderate-quality evidence that melatonin does not reduce the
length of stay (two studies; 500 participants); results were down-
graded for inconsistency. There is uncertainty regarding the effect
of melatonin on in-hospital mortality due to low-quality evidence
from three studies that was downgraded because of imprecise re-
sults and a very small number of events (n = 543 participants).
On the basis of two RCTs (n = 2057 participants), there is mod-
erate-quality evidence that BIS-guided anaesthesia reduces the in-
cidence of delirium compared to BIS-blinded anaesthesia/clinical
judgement. The evidence was downgraded due to the risk of bias
associated with participants and personnel being unblinded and
incomplete outcome assessment. There was also an unclear risk of
selection bias in Radtke 2013. There is also moderate-quality ev-
idence that BIS-guided anaesthesia resulted in a shorter length of
hospital admission compared to BIS-blinded anaesthesia/clinical
judgement (two studies, n = 2057 participants), also downgraded
due to risk of bias.
Potential biases in the review process
This review has followed Cochrane procedures and there were only
a small number of amendments to the review process, which are
outlined in Differences between protocol and review.
Agreements and disagreements with other
studies or reviews
The previous version of this review (Siddiqi 2007) only included
six studies, none of which assessed the same intervention. The
review highlighted the potential role for multi-component inter-
vention (a Geriatric Consultation Service) and the use of atypical
antipsychotic medication, but identified the need for a larger body
of evidence before drawing conclusions or practice recommenda-
tions. The evidence base for multi-component interventions for
the prevention of incident delirium in hospitalised non-ICU pa-
tients has expanded considerably since the previous version, and
the evidence summarised in this update supports the use of multi-
component interventions. However, we found a continuing lack
of evidence to support the use of antipsychotic medication as a
group in the prevention of delirium.
Our principal review finding of the positive role of multi-compo-
nent interventions to prevent delirium is consistent with the wider
published literature (Abraha 2015). The multi-component inter-
vention programme known as the Hospital Elder Life Program
(HELP) for Prevention of Delirium has demonstrated effective
reductions in the incidence of delirium in non-randomised trials
(Inouye 1999a; Inouye 2000). Hshieh 2015 published a meta-
analysis of intervention studies using multi-component non-phar-
macological interventions and, although identifying similar issues
with heterogeneity limiting reporting, found evidence to support
reductions in delirium incidence and falls. Two recent system-
atic reviews have reached similar conclusions to those of this re-
view. Martinez 2015 identified that multi-component interven-
tions were effective in reducing incident delirium and accidental
44

 falls for hospitalised adults. Zhang 2013 specifically reviewed the
role of interventions to prevent postoperative delirium and identi-
fied that multi-component interventions were beneficial, although
the review also identified positive benefits from sedation and an-
tipsychotic medications not replicated by our findings.
Multi-component interventions for delirium prevention are now
also recognised and recommended in practice guidelines. The UK
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guide-
lines for delirium were published in 2010 (NICE 2010). These
identified multi-component interventions as having a critical role
in identifying and addressing modifiable, clinical risk factors for
delirium prevention. Multi-component assessment and interven-
tion is recommended within 24 hours of admission for those at
risk; the intervention should be personalised to the needs of the in-
dividual and delivered by a multidisciplinary team (NICE 2010).
Cost savings are identified to be anticipated, although we found
no data on this in our review.
The lack of impact of multi-component interventions on mor-
tality and institutionalisation, despite a reduction in delirium is
a surprising finding. Falls and institutionalisation are thought to
be associated with frailty and may represent complications of the
frailty syndrome (Clegg 2013; Eeles 2012; Fried 2001). Death and
institutionalisation as endpoints may, therefore, represent non-
modifiable manifestations of frailty, and be relatively insensitive
to a reduction in incident delirium, although a recent study has
questioned the association of delirium with frailty (Joosten 2014).
Reporting baseline frailty in future trials (measured with a vali-
dated frailty assessment instrument) would help to clarify this re-
lationship.
Our findings for cholinesterase inhibitors are consistent with pre-
vious related studies. A large trial of another cholinesterase in-
hibitor, rivastigmine, for treatment of delirium in intensive care
patients was halted in 2010 following safety concerns and no evi-
dence of effectiveness (Sheldon 2010; van Eijk 2010).
Findings for antipsychotics are also consistent with a recent pub-
lished review (Fok 2015).
The heterogeneity of our results for melatonin has also been re-
ported by Chen and colleagues (Chen 2015). They conducted a
subgroup analysis, and concluded that melatonin was effective in
preventing delirium in medical, but not surgical patients.

Implications for practice
The evidence base for multi-component interventions to prevent
delirium in patients admitted to medical and surgical wards is
strong and supports the adoption of systems of care that incorpo-
rate multi-component interventions to prevent delirium in hospi-
tals as part of routine care.
Implications for research
Further “proof of concept” randomised controlled trials investi-
gating the effectiveness of multi-component interventions to pre-
vent delirium in hospitalised non-ICU patients are unwarranted
(and unethical, as an effective treatment is denied to the control
group). The focus of future research should be trials of implemen-
tation and to identify the key ’active’ components to improve our
understanding of the determinants for successful and efficient de-
ployment of multi-component interventions. Such trials should
consider cluster randomisation (to minimise performance bias);
incorporate more discriminatory baseline descriptors (to better ac-
count for delirium, frailty, and dementia interactions); and have at
least a medium-term follow-up period (to assess the personal and
system-level impact of delirium prevention). Preliminary evidence
for the content of multi-component interventions suggests that
they should include as a minimum: staff education; individualised
care (sometimes referred to as person-centred care); re-orientation
at frequent intervals; and early mobilisation, but this needs fur-
ther investigation. These areas are familiar aspects of care but are
currently poorly and unreliably delivered.
Monitoring the depth of anaesthesia through awareness of the Bis-
pectral index (BIS) and the ability to control the level of anaesthe-
sia reduced the incidence of postoperative delirium. However, the
optimal level for depth of anaesthesia has not been established in
the included studies and this remains an area for further research.
The role of drugs and other anaesthetic techniques (to reduce post-
operative delirium) in the prevention of delirium remains uncer-
tain with negative or conflicting findings. New research is justified,
particularlyregardingthe role of typical andatypical antipsychotics
and melatonin (including different settings, variations in physio-
logical melatonin levels and different doses), but should account
for developments in the understanding of the neuropathophysi-
ology of delirium. In the case of atypical antipsychotics, the asso-
ciation between antipsychotics and increased mortality amongst
older people with cognitive impairment may limit their usefulness
as a prophylactic measure in this population (Huybrechts 2012).
Furthermore, given the current evidence base supporting the use
of multi-component interventions, future trials of pharmacolog-
ical agents for delirium prevention should optimise multi-com-
ponent non-pharmacological delirium prevention in intervention
and control arms to look for any additional benefit obtained from
medication. The evidence does not support cholinesterase in-
hibitors for delirium prevention as a priority for further investiga-
tion.

physical restraints, anticholinergic drugs, or the need for ACE services;
(2) If the physician orders a urinary catheter, s/he will receive interruptive alerts to
recommending discontinuing the catheter;
(3) If the physician orders physical restraints, s/he will receive interruptive alerts recom-
mending substituting physical restraints with the use of a professional sitter or low dose
trazodone;
(4) If the physician orders any of the 18 inappropriate anticholinergics, s/he will receive
interruptive alerts recommending stopping the drug, suggesting an alternative, or rec-
ommending dose modification
(5) The physician was required to make a decision to accept, reject, or modify any of the
interruptive alerts

Interventions
Intervention: Participants randomised to the intervention arm received a graded physical
activity and orientation programme twice daily, which was delivered in addition to usual
care. A certified Allied Health Assistant, trained in administering exercise programmes,
delivered the intervention after initial assessment of the participant by a physiotherapist.
The programme started on the same day as the participant was randomised. Commen-
surate with ability, participants were prescribed one of four exercise programmes: bed,
seated, standing or rails. All programmes were customised to the participant’s ability and
were reviewed daily. Exercise programmes were modified to ensure suitable progression
for those participants who made significant gains
The orientation programme comprised formal and informal elements. The formal el-
ement of the programme comprised a series of seven questions aimed at assessing and
improving orientation (day, month, year, date, ward, bed number and name of primary
nurse). The participant was asked the questions in sequence and prompted with the cor-
rect answer if they were not able to give a correct response. The informal element of the
programme related to engaging in the exercise programme and in the social interaction
with the Allied Health Assistant and/or Physiotherapist
Control: Usual care included 24-hour nursing care, daily medical assessment and allied
health referral by medical, nursing or other staff. Allied health input was provided on
referral only, but daily ward meetings were held to review patient progress and facilitate
referrals. Patients with significant functional, cognitive or social issues could be referred to
the Aged Care medical consultation service that performed a daily round and could offer
advice regarding the recognition, investigation and management of geriatric syndromes
including delirium
Outcomes
1. Incidence of delirium, using CAM
2. Duration of delirium
3. Severity of delirium, using CAM
4. Length of stay
5. Return to previous residence

Inclusion criteria: Aged 65 years and over undergoing hip fracture repair with spinal
anaesthesia and propofol sedation
Exclusion criteria: Contraindications to spinal anaesthesia, prior hip surgery, mental or
language barriers that would preclude data collection, severe heart failure, severe COPD
Participants
Number in study: 114
Country: USA
Setting: Hip fracture patients
Age: Mean age 81.2 years (SD 7.6) in intervention group, 81.8 years (SD 6.7) in control
group
Sex: 70% female in intervention group, 75% female in control group
Co-morbidity: Mean Charlson comorbidity index score 1.6 (1.2) in intervention group,

Interventions
Intervention: Sedation was provided during surgery by a propofol infusion targeted to a
bispectral index (BIS) of 80 or higher in the light sedation group
Control: Sedation was provided during surgery by a propofol infusion targeted to a
bispectral index (BIS) of approximately 50 in the deep sedation group
In general, these targets render the light sedation group responsive to voice and the heavy
sedation group unresponsive to noxious stimuli

Interventions
Both groups received induction of anaesthesia with propofol and sufentanil. Muscle
relaxation was obtained with rocuronium. Anaesthetic depth was adjusted by titration of
end-expiratoryxenonorsevoflurane concentrationsaccordingto changesinphysiological
parameters and BIS values. During CPB, patients received a propofol infusion instead
of xenon or sevoflurane
Xenon: Maintenance of anaesthesia was achieved by continuous infusion of sufentanil
and xenon (end-expiratory concentrations of 45-50 vol%)
Sevoflurane: Maintenance of anaesthesia was achieved by continuous infusion of sufen-
tanil and sevoflurane (end-expiratory concentrations of 1-1.4 vol%)

Interventions
Intervention: Patients in the ketamine group received 0.2 mg/kg on induction of general
anaesthesia and then 2 mcg/kg/hr until discharge from the post-anaesthesia care unit
Control: All patients received a general anaesthetic with midazolam 5 mg, 70% nitrous
oxide, 0.4% isoflurane, fentanyl at 1-2 mcg/kg/hr and propofol at 70-100 mg/hr. Spinal
morphine (10 mcg/kg) was administered at instrumentation
Outcomes
1) Incident delirium, measured using CAM on postoperative day 1
Notes
Funding source: Department of Anesthesia, Hospital for Special Surgery, New York
Declarations of interest: Not reported
Delirium not excluded at enrolment
Study author conclusion: use of ketamine as an adjunct to postoperative pain manage-
ment in opioid tolerant patients after spinal fusion reduced postoperative pain. There
was no effect on delirium
Small trial (n = 24). Only reported delirium on postoperative day 1
Concern about the integrity of the intervention 3 in control failed their initial pain
management and were converted to IV ketamine

Interventions
Intervention: Acute geriatric ward - 20 bed ward mainly admitting patients suffering
from acute medical disorder superimposed upon frailty, co-morbidities and polyphar-
macy. Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment was the basis for treatment planning. Assess-
ment by geriatrician, nurse, physiotherapist and occupational therapists was expected
during their first day on the ward and this team had daily meetings to plan discharge.
Checklists and clinical routines based on published literature and previous experience.
These included medication reviews, optimal pain control, correction of physiological
disturbances preoperatively and postoperatively (hypoxaemia, anaemia, electrolyte dis-

intensive mobilisation, optimising pre and postoperative nutrition and early discharge
planning. Outpatient orthopaedic clinic at 4 months
Control: Usual care in orthopaedic ward setting. Staffing levels were similar but there
was no multidisciplinary meetings and no geriatric assessments. Early mobilisation was
emphasised and patients were seen by a physiotherapist soon after surgery. Outpatient
orthopaedic clinic at 4 months

the corridor. As a result there are concerns
about the fidelity of the intervention as a
delirium prevention intervention as not all
participants had the entire length of stay in
either unit

The original protocol was published in 2005 and stated the analysis would be performed using an intention-to-treat approach and this
was adopted in the original version of the review (Siddiqi 2007). However, for this update an available case analysis was performed
consistently, including re-analysing the six studies included in the original review.
We added adverse events (falls, pressure ulcers, mortality) as outcomes although this was not specified in the original published protocol.
We also removed physical morbidity from secondary outcomes, and instead included infections (specifically wound infections, urinary
tract infections, pneumonia) and cardiac adverse events (specifically myocardial infarction and cardiac failure) as adverse events.
’Summary of findings’ tables were added in accordance with current Cochrane Collaboration Guidance utilising GRADE assessments.
We also specified studies conducted in ICU settings would be excluded in this update.
Authorship for this update has changed with the addition of AC, ET, JH, JY, SS, and JT. AB, JH and RS are no longer authors on this
update.
