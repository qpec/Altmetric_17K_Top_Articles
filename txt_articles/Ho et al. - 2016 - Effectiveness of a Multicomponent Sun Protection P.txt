Abstract
Importance—Emphasizing sun protection behaviors among young children may minimize sun 
damage and foster lifelong sun protection behaviors that will reduce the likelihood of developing 
skin cancer, especially melanoma.
Objective—To determine whether a multicomponent sun protection program delivered in 
pediatric clinics during the summer could increase summertime sun protection among young 
children.
Design, Setting, and Participants—Randomized controlled clinical trial with 4-week follow-
up that included 300 parents or relatives (hereafter simply referred to as caregivers [mean age, 36.0 
years]) who brought the child (2-6 years of age) in their care to an Advocate Medical Group clinic 
during the period from May 15 to August 14, 2015. Of the 300 caregiver-child pairs, 153 (51.0%) 
were randomly assigned to receive a read-along book, swim shirt, and weekly text-message 
reminders related to sun protection behaviors (intervention group) and 147 (49.0%) were randomly 
assigned to receive the information usually provided at a well-child visit (control group). Data 
analysis was performed from August 20 to 30, 2015.

 Intervention—Multicomponent sun protection program composed of a read-along book, swim 
shirt, and weekly text-message reminders related to sun protection behaviors.
Main Outcomes and Measures—Outcomes were caregiver-reported use of sun protection by 
the child (seeking shade and wearing sun-protective clothing and sunscreen) using a 5-point Likert 
scale, duration of outdoor activities, and number of children who had sunburn or skin irritation. 
The biologic measurement of the skin pigment of a child's arm was performed with a 
spectrophotometer at baseline and 4 weeks later.
Results—Of the 300 caregiver-child pairs, the 153 children in the intervention group had 
significantly higher scores related to sun protection behaviors on both sunny (mean [SE], 15.748 
[0.267] for the intervention group; mean [SE], 14.780 [0.282] for the control group; mean 
difference, 0.968) and cloudy days (mean [SE], 14.286 [0.282] for the intervention group; mean 
[SE], 12.850 [0.297] for the control group; mean difference, 1.436). Examination of pigmentary 
changes by spectrophotometry revealed that the children in the control group significantly 
increased their melanin levels, whereas the children in the intervention group did not have a 
significant change in melanin level on their protected upper arms (P < .001 for skin type 1, P = .
008 for skin type 2, and P < .001 for skin types 4-6).
Conclusions and Relevance—A multicomponent intervention using text-message reminders 
and distribution of read-along books and swim shirts was associated with increased sun protection 
behaviors among young children. This was corroborated by a smaller change in skin pigment 
among children receiving the intervention. This implementable program can help augment 
anticipatory sun protection guidance in pediatric clinics and decrease children's future skin cancer 
risk.
The incidence of melanoma is 74 000 cases per year, and it is the second most common form 
of cancer among adolescents and young adults in the United States.1,2 Whether it occurs 
during childhood or adolescence, sun exposure increases the risk of skin cancer.3,4 
Emphasizing sun protection behaviors among young children may minimize sun damage 
and foster lifelong sun protection behaviors that will reduce the likelihood of developing 
melanoma.
Sun protection is one of the anticipatory guidance topics recommended by Bright Futures, a 
national health promotion and prevention initiative led by the American Academy of 
Pediatrics (https://brightfutures.aap.org/Pages/default.aspx). Handouts that pediatric 
clinicians can provide to families include age-specific information about sun protection.5 An 
estimated 43% of US children 6 to 11 years of age experience 1 or more cases of sunburn 
each year,6 thus demonstrating the need for better sun protection education of caregivers. 
Our hypothesis is that pediatricians' seasonal age-specific sun protection recommendations 
would be more effective if supported by a home program that reinforced effective strategies 
for sun protection.
Recommended strategies for sun protection include the use of sunscreen, sun avoidance, and 
the use of sun-protective clothing.1 While sunscreen use and sun avoidance were the most 
frequently used strategies (62% and 27% of children, respectively, used these strategies), the 
use of sun-protective clothing, which is effective when wet, is as effective as sunscreen in 
reducing the number of moles, which are precursors of and the strongest risk factor for the

 development of melanoma, on the bodies of children.6-9 Our objective was to determine 
whether a multicomponent intervention that gave a read-along book and a sun-protective 
swim shirt to children in pediatric clinics and sent 4 weekly text-message reminders could 
increase summertime sun protection among young children.
Methods
Study Setting and Dates
This randomized controlled clinical trial was performed from May 15 to August 14, 2015, at 
2 urban pediatric clinics with 15 participating pediatricians. The clinical locations serve 
populations in which 38% of adults older than 25 years of age hold bachelor's degrees or 
higher degrees, the median household income is approximately $69 000, and the population 
is 88%white, 3% African American, and 10% Hispanic or Latino.10 This study was 
approved by the Northwestern University institutional review board and the Advocate Health 
Care institutional review board (trial protocol in Supplement 1). Informed consent was 
obtained from all participating parents of eligible children.
Recruitment
Parents or relatives (hereafter simply referred to as caregivers [mean age, 36.0 years]) were 
enrolled in this study if they were at least 18 years of age, could read in either English or 
Spanish, brought a child between 2 and 6 years of age to a well-child visit, were able to 
receive text messages, and would return for a follow-up visit in 4to 6 weeks. The caregivers 
were recruited by on-site research assistants.
Interventions
Block randomization by day to either the intervention or control group ensured that children 
in the control group did not see the intervention materials. Pediatricians were blinded to the 
randomization and did not perform verbal sun protection counseling. Some distributed age-
appropriate Bright Futures handouts. After the conclusion of the visit with the pediatrician, 
those in the intervention group received a read-along book and a sun-protective swim shirt 
and made an appointment to return for a visit with the research coordinator in about 4 to 6 
weeks. The 13-page read-along book emphasized sun protection behaviors with child 
characters representing all ethnic/ racial groups going to a water park11 (Figure 1). Between 
baseline and follow-up visits, 4 sun protection reminders were sent weekly via text 
messages. The caregivers completed an exit survey at the follow-up visit.
After completing an exit survey, the caregivers in the control group received all study 
materials (read-along book and swim shirt) at the follow-up visit. The caregivers received a 
$20 gift card when the baseline assessment was completed and a $50 gift card when the 
follow-up assessments were completed.
Data Collection
A prospective study design was used to survey caregivers at baseline and at follow-up 4 
weeks later. Each eligible child's skin melanin content was assessed by spectrophotometry at 
base-line and follow-up (Mexameter MX18 probe; Courage + Khazaka Electronic GmbH).12

 Measures
At baseline, data on the demographic characteristics and sun sensitivity of the caregiver and 
the child were obtained. Information on the child's skin color was obtained by showing color 
bars to the caregiver, who was instructed to select the bar that most closely resembled the 
color of the child's skin on the upper inner arm and to circle 1 of 6 numbers beside the bar 
(signifying skin types 1-6).13 Children with skin type 4, 5, or 6 were grouped together 
because they are unlikely to have either sunburn or sun irritation when in temperate climates.
At baseline and follow-up, the child's sunburn or skin irritation was assessed by the 
caregiver indicating how many times in the past month the child (1) “had red or painful 
sunburn (even a small part of his/her skin) for more than 12 hours” or (2) “had skin irritation 
from the sun (even a small part of his/her skin) for more than 12 hours” (Cronbach α = .94, 
determined by use of an internal reliability test). The caregiver reported the average number 
of hours the child was outside per day between 10 AM and 4 PM in the past month (α = .
81) (survey in eAppendix in Supplement 2).
Data on sun protection by the child were provided by the caregiver reporting on the 
frequency of 5 behaviors using a 5-point Likert scale ranging from “never” to “always.” 
These behaviors were assessed separately for warm sunny days and warm cloudy days for a 
total of 10 questions at baseline and follow-up. These behaviors included wearing sunscreen, 
a shirt with sleeves covering the shoulders, a hat with a brim, and sunglasses and staying in 
the shade. The 5 questions assessing sun protection behavior during sunny days were 
summed to create an aggregate score for sunny-day behaviors (range, 5-25; α = .63 at 
baseline; α = .53 at follow-up); the 5 questions assessing sun protection behavior during 
cloudy days were aggregated to create a score for cloudy-day behaviors (range, 5-25; α = .
53 at baseline; α = .60 at follow-up).14
Another set of scales separated each of the 5 skin protection behaviors, and each scale 
consisted of the sum of 2 items: Likert scale scores for behavior frequency on a warm sunny 
day and on a warm cloudy day (range, 2-10). For example, the scores for sunscreen use on a 
sunny day and the scores for sunscreen use on a cloudy day were summed for an overall 
score of sunscreen use. All 5 scales had significant correlations between the 2 items within 
each scale (all P < .01) at both base- line and follow-up (for sunscreen behavior, r = 0.712 at 
baseline and r = 0.679 at follow-up; for shirt behavior, r = 0.830 at baseline and r = 0.815 at 
follow-up; for hat behavior, r = 0.801 at baseline and r = 0.813 at follow-up; for sunglasses 
behavior, r = 0.792 at baseline and r = 0.828 at follow-up; and for shade behavior, r = 0.770 
at baseline and r = 0.792 at follow-up).
Biologic Measure—The melanin indices of the sun-exposed right dorsal forearm and the 
sun-protected (when wearing a short-sleeved shirt) right upper outer arm near to the 
shoulder were obtained with the spectrophotometer at the baseline and follow-up visits for 
both control and intervention groups. The area under the intensity curve along the 450- to 
615- nm wavelength interval of reflected light ranges from 1 to 1000, with the lower range 
associated with light skin color.

 Intervention-Specific Measures—The weekly text messages that elicited yes or no 
responses from caregivers in the intervention group were as follows: (1) Did you read the 
book with your child? (2) During the past week, did your child wear a hat? (3) During the 
past week, did your child wear the swim shirt given at the first study visit? (4) In the past 
week, did your child get a sunburn or skin irritation on even a small part of skin?
Statistical Analysis
Based on preliminary data showing that sun protection behaviors increased 20% after 
counseling, the sample size required to detect a 20% difference in using sun protection 
between the control and intervention groups was 300 (150 in each group), assuming an α 
level of less than .05 and a power of 80% or greater in a 2-tailed test. For our comparison of 
sun protection use on both sunny and cloudy days, it was determined that we would be able 
to detect effect sizes that correspond to small η2 values (ie, proportion of explained 
variance), in the range of 2% (or smaller). The sample sizes were expected to yield a power 
of greater than 90%.
The primary outcome measure was sun protection use on both sunny days and cloudy days. 
Two 2 (condition) by 2 (time) mixed-measures analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were 
performed, one for the sunny-day behaviors scale and one for the cloudy-day behaviors 
scale.
Next, the intervention effects on specific skin protection behaviors were assessed (sunscreen, 
shirt, hat, sunglasses, and shade behaviors). For these analyses, five 2 (condition) by 2 (time) 
mixed-measures ANOVAs were performed. Lastly, to determine whether individual 
behaviors were affected by the intervention, ten 2 (condition) by 2 (time) mixed-measures 
ANOVAs were performed, one for each behavior on sunny days and one for each behavior 
on cloudy days. When omnibus significant effects were observed, post hoc pairwise 
comparisons using the Tukey test were used to compare mean values across the groups as 
recommended by Jaccard.15
Additional outcomes for participating children include change in melanin index, number of 
children who had sunburn or skin irritation from sun, and duration of outdoor activities. 
Differences between the intervention and control groups were analyzed using mixed-
measures ANOVA followed by the Tukey test, the 2-tailed t test, and the χ2 test, 
respectively.
Results
Of 347 eligible caregiver-child pairs, 300 (86.5%) participated in our study. Of the 300 
caregiver-child pairs, 153 (51.0%) were randomly assigned to receive a read-along book, 
swim shirt, and weekly text-message reminders related to sun protection behaviors 
(intervention group), and 147 (49.0%) were randomly assigned to receive the information 
usually provided at a well-child visit (control group) (Figure 2). There were significant 
differences between the groups in the type of care-giver-child relationship and in the level of 
education of the mothers and fathers. Independent-groups t tests comparing groups on 
parental history of skin cancer (t = -2.915; P = .65), parental skin sensitivity (t = -1.935; P

 = .05), and child skin sensitivity (t = -0.518; P = .61) showed no significant differences 
(Table 1).
Attrition
Of the 300 caregiver-child pairs who completed assessments at baseline, 280 finished 
assessments at follow-up (93.3% retention rate). To test for attrition bias, the caregiver-child 
pairs who did not complete assessments at follow-up were compared with those who did 
complete assessment at follow-up on baseline measures. The χ2 test was performed for 
categorical variables (eg, race), and the t test was performed for continuous variables (eg, 
sunscreen use). Owing to the number of analyses performed, an adjusted P value of less 
than .01 was used to determine statistical significance. The control and intervention groups 
were compared based on demographic characteristics and other baseline variables, with the 
χ2 test used for categorical variables (eg, race) and the t test used for continuous variables 
(eg, skin sensitivity to sun).
Compared with the caregiver-child pairs who completed the study, those who were lost to 
attrition did not differ based on any demographic characteristics. Caregivers who were lost 
to attrition had significantly lower baseline scores of care-givers' perceptions of their own 
risk of getting skin cancer (t = 3.279; P = .001) and reported that their children were less 
likely to wear a hat on a sunny day (t = −3.174; P = .004) and less likely to use sunscreen on 
a cloudy day (t = −2.219; P = .03).
Intervention Effects
Of the 153 caregiver-child pairs in the intervention group, 95 caregivers (62.1%) reported 
reading the read-along book with their child within 1 week of the baseline visit, and 88 
children (57.5%) wore the study-providedswimshirtwithin3 weeks of the baseline visit. 
There were no significant differences between intervention and control groups in duration of 
outdoor activity or in the number of children who had sunburn or skin irritation over the 
study period (Table 2).
Sunny-Day Behavior Scores—The ANOVA showed a significant interaction of time by 
group (F1,277 = 10.220; P < .01; η2 = 0.036) (Figure 3A). At baseline, the control group had 
higher scores related to sunny-day skin protection behaviors (mean difference between 
intervention and control, −0.071). Post hoc Tukey test results revealed that while the 
increase in behavior scores in the intervention group were statistically significant (mean 
difference between follow-up and baseline, 0.72), the control group significantly decreased 
their behavior scores (mean difference between follow-up and baseline, −0.72). The 
intervention group had significantly higher scores related to sun protection behaviors at 
follow-up compared with the control group (mean [SE], 15.748 [0.267] for the intervention 
group; mean [SE], 14.780 [0.282] for the control group; mean difference, 0.968).
Cloudy-Day Behavior Scores—At follow-up, the intervention group had significantly 
higher skin protection behavior scores during cloudy days than did the control group (mean 
[SE], 14.286 [0.282] for the intervention group; mean [SE], 12.850 [0.297] for the control 
group; mean difference, 1.436) (ANOVA: F1,278 = 8.054; P < .01; η2 = 0.028) (Figure 3B).

 These analyses controlled for any differences in cloudy-day behavior scores at baseline. 
Similar to sunny-day behavior scores, the intervention group increased their scores related to 
sun protection behaviors on cloudy days over the study period (mean difference between 
follow-up and baseline, 0.266), whereas the control group significantly decreased their 
scores related to sun protection behaviors from baseline to follow-up (mean difference, 
-0.782).
Skin Protection Behavior Scores—At follow-up, the intervention group had 
significantly higher scores related to sunscreen use than did the control group (mean [SE], 
7.197 [0.174] for the intervention group; mean [SE], 6.383 [0.182] for the control group; 
mean difference between intervention and control groups, 0.814) (ANOVA: F1,278 = 10.411; 
P < .01; η2 = 0.036) (Figure 3C). The intervention group significantly increased their scores 
related to sunscreen use (mean difference between baseline and follow-up, 0.496). The 
ANOVAs were not significant for seeking shade or for wearing shirts, hats, or sunglasses.
Individual Sun Protection Behaviors—The ANOVA of the interaction of group by 
time revealed significant interactions for 3 items: (1) sunscreen use on sunny days (F1,277 = 
4.912; P < .05; η2 = 0.017); (2) sunscreen use on cloudy days (F1,278 = 11.416; P < .01; η2 = 
0.039); and (3) wearing a shirt with sleeves on sunny days (F1,275 = 4.185; P < .05; η2 = 
0.015). At follow-up, the intervention group had (1) significantly higher scores related to 
sunscreen use on sunny days (mean [SE], 3.932 [0.091] for the intervention group; mean 
[SE], 3.659 [0.096] for the control group; mean difference, 0.273); (2) significantly higher 
scores related to sunscreen use on cloudy days (mean [SE], 3.265 [0.099] for the 
intervention group; mean [SE], 2.729 [0.104] for the control group; mean difference, 0.536); 
and (3) significantly higher scores related to wearing a shirt with sleeves on sunny days 
(mean [SE], 3.837 [0.091]; for the intervention group; mean [SE], 3.569 [0.0.97] for the 
control group; mean difference, 0.268).
Melanin Indices—The ANOVAs examining change in melanin index across skin types (1, 
2, and 3 for lighter skin colors and 4, 5, and 6 for darker skin colors) were exploratory owing 
to the slightly lower number of children in several skin-type categories. Results revealed 
significant increases in the melanin index in the control group from baseline to follow-up 
that were not observed in the intervention group with regard to the skin on the outer upper 
arm (Table 2). Follow-up Tukey test results revealed significant higher mean differences (all 
P = .05) from baseline to follow-up for the control group for type 1 (29.269 nm), type 2 
(41.530 nm), and types 4, 5, and 6 skin (124.666 nm). There were no other significant 
differences in change in melanin index between the control and intervention groups with 
regard to the skin on the forearm.
Discussion
This multicomponent skin protection program (composed of a read-along book, a sun-
protective swim shirt, and weekly sun protection text messages) increased the number of 
children who practiced sun protection behaviors over the summer, on both sunny and cloudy 
days. Children who were in the intervention group were more likely to use sunscreen and

 wear a shirt with sleeves. Across all skin types, the intervention group had significantly less 
change in the melanin index on the sun-protected upper arm than did the control group.
While more children in the intervention group were reported by caregivers to engage in sun 
protection behaviors, fewer children in the control group were reported by care-givers to 
engage in sun protection behaviors. The sun-protective habits of the control groups' families 
may have deteriorated over the summer for reasons related to the inconvenience of sun 
protection behaviors, particularly sunscreen use because it is the most common form of sun 
protection.6,16-19 Notably, the intervention prevented this deterioration in sun protection 
behaviors and significantly increased overall sunscreen use.
Previous attempts to improve summertime sun protection behaviors among caregivers and 
young children via increased counseling at a pediatric clinic were not effective.20,21 The lack 
of effect of counseling may contribute to 0.01% of pediatrician visits, including sun 
protection counseling.22 Promisingly, other randomized controlled clinical trials with 
distribution of sun protection products (eg, sunscreen and clothing) increased parental 
knowledge and practice of sun protection behaviors.23-25 However, none of these studies 
evaluated whether children receiving the intervention experienced less pigment change. In 
addition, the interventions in those studies tended to rely on a combination of regular follow-
up and counseling in pediatric clinics.
Our multicomponent sun protection programis unique in several aspects. It significantly 
increased caregiver-reported sun protection behaviors without clinicians providing 
anticipatory guidance. Regular text messages reinforced behavior change. Furthermore, the 
read-along book may have prompted children to request sun protection from their caregivers. 
To corroborate the survey results and provide a biologic end point of efficacy, melanin 
indices were monitored over time. The children in the intervention group had significantly 
lower increases in the melanin index on the upper arm that was covered by the shirt, which 
provided biological support for the survey results showing that children in the intervention 
group were more likely to wear a shirt with sleeves. The lack of difference in the change in 
the melanin index on the forearm between the control and intervention groups may be due to 
a failure to use sunscreen on the forearm that was not covered by the shirt or may be due to 
the use of sunscreens that do not completely block UV radiation.
Despite the present study's strengths, there are a few limitations to note. First, although there 
is very low incentive to be gained by participants' attempting to deceive study staff members, 
there is always a small possibility that the caregivers' reported data may have been 
influenced by social desirability bias. Second, the Cronbach α values for the sunny-day and 
cloudy-day behavior Likert scale scores were relatively low at baseline and follow-up. This 
suggests that participants did not engage in all the sun protection behaviors equally but, 
perhaps, displayed preferences that drove changes in the composite scale scores. Lastly, 
although the participant population was ethnically heterogeneous, the relatively small 
number of children in each minority group prevented an ethnically stratified analysis of the 
data. Future studies should examine whether the intervention affected behavior equally 
among the different ethnic groups. Finally, the number of children in some of the skin-type

 groups was lower than desired. Future studies would benefit by expanding on these findings 
with larger samples of children in each skin-type group.
Conclusions
The 2014 Recommendations for Preventive Pediatric Health Care of the American Academy 
of Pediatrics state that age-specific anticipatory guidance is to be performed at every well-
child visit.26 Pediatricians' seasonal age-specific sun protection recommendations will be 
more effective if supported by an effective, easily accessible, multicomponent program that 
can be reinforced at home. Because pediatricians distribute read-along books to improve 
literacy, they may distribute a book focusing on sun protection in the spring and summer and 
incur similar costs in doing so.27-29 Fostering sun protection behaviors in childhood may 
help children decrease their future risk of skin cancers. The multicomponent program 
presented in this study (composed of regular text-message reminders, a read-along book, and 
a swim shirt) was effective in increasing sun protection behaviors while minimizing biologic 
measures of sun damage (namely, the melanin index).

 Key Points
Question
How can pediatricians improve sun protection behaviors among young children?
Findings
In this summertime randomized clinical trial of 300 children and their caregivers, 
families that received read-along books emphasizing sun protection, sun-protective shirts, 
and weekly text-message reminders related to sun protection behaviors reported 
statistically significantly higher sun protection behavior scores. Children in the 
intervention group also had significantly less pigment darkening of the upper outer arm 
protected by the shirt.
Meaning
Pediatric anticipatory sun protection guidance can be augmented by distributing handouts 
that include age-specific information about sun protection.
