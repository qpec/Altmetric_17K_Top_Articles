Background: Durable HIV-1 remission after interruption of combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) has 
been reported in some adults who started cART during primary HIV-1 infection. However the 
possibility of long-term remission in vertically-infected children remained unclear. Here we report the 
case of a perinatally-HIV-1-infected adolescent with unprecedented HIV-1 remission. 
Methods: The patient was identified among 100 perinatally HIV-infected children followed up in the 
ANRS EPF CO10 Pediatric Cohort who initiated cART before 6 months of age. HIV-RNA and CD4+ T-
cell counts have been monitored since birth. Ultrasensitive HIV-RNA (Biocentric Ultrasensitive Generic 
HIV-1 RNA Viral Load kit), PBMC-associated HIV-DNA (Biocentric ultrasensitive Generic HIV DNA 
Cell kit), HIV-specific T-cell responses (production of cytokines and capacity to suppress HIV infection), 
reactivation of the CD4+ T-cell reservoir (measured by p24 ELISA and HIV RNA in supernatants upon 
PHA-activation of purified CD4+ T cells), and plasma concentration of antiretrovirals were evaluated 
after >11 years of control off therapy.  
Findings: One infant born from a woman with uncontrolled HIV-1 viremia received zidovudine-based 
prophylaxis during 6 weeks. HIV-RNA and DNA were not detected 3 and 14 days after birth. HIV-DNA 
was detected at 4 weeks of age. HIV-RNA reached 2.1x106 copies/ml at 3 months of age and cART 
was initiated. HIV-RNA was undetectable one month later. cART was discontinued by the family at 
some time between 5.8 and 6.8 years of age. HIV-RNA was undetectable at 6.8 years of age and 
cART was not resumed. HIV-RNA has remained <50 copies/ml and CD4+ T-cell counts stable through 
18.3 years of age. After 11 years of control off therapy, HIV-RNA was below 4 copies/ml and HIV-DNA 
was 2.2 Log copies/106 PBMC. HLA genotype showed homozygosity at several loci (A*2301-
;B*1503/4101;C*0210/0802;DRB1*1101-;DQB1*0602-). HIV-specific CD8+ T-cell responses and T-
cell activation were weak.  
Interpretation: This case suggests that long-term HIV-1 remission is possible in perinatally-infected-
early-treated children, with similar characteristics as reported in adult post-treatment controllers. 
Further studies will be necessary to understand the mechanisms associated with HIV remission and 
whether early treatment of infected children may particularly favour the conditions needed to achieve 
HIV control after treatment discontinuation.   
Funding: Study funded by ANRS.

RESEARCH IN CONTEXT 
Evidence before this study 
We searched PubMed without filters for “HIV”, “cure”, “remission” and “children”. A single report in 
2013 described the case of the in utero HIV-1-infected «Mississippi child» who exhibited transient viral 
control after interrupting very early-initiated cART. After this case was reported several studies pointed 
to the particular opportunity of tackling HIV infection in children to obtain virological remission. 
However viremia rebounded in the Mississippi child 27 months later and other recent reports have 
described viral relapse after treatment interruption in perinatally-infected children. This left unsolved 
the possibility of long-term remission in HIV-infected children.  
Added value of this study 
This study shows that a perinatally-HIV infected young patient who started cART at 3 months of age 
has been able to control HIV viremia to undetectable levels for over 12 years after treatment was 
discontinued by the family at around 6.5 years of age. This patient was not able to naturally control 
viremia without optimal cART early in life as viral load raised to high levels in two episodes of poor 
treatment compliance. Moreover the patient’s MHC background is generally associated with rapid 
progression in the absence of treatment. HIV DNA is still present in the cells from this patient and low 
levels of viral reactivation can be achieved in vitro, although at very low levels. 
Implications of all the available evidence 
Our case provides the first evidence of durable virological remission in a perinatally-HIV infected 
adolescent. The clinical history of this patient suggests a decisive role of the duration of cART to 
achieve a status that then allowed viral remission after treatment discontinuation. Although exceptional, 
this case of virological remission in a perinatally-HIV infected patient shares some characteristics with 
HIV adult patients in remission of infection; among them, the early, although not immediate, initiation 
of antiretroviral treatment.  Together with available evidence, this case strongly supports the search for 
a possible window of opportunity early after HIV infection for cART implementation in children and 
adults that might lead to the establishment of a viro-immunological context favouring HIV control after 
treatment discontinuation.

INTRODUCTION 
HIV-1 replication generally rebounds from latent cellular reservoirs after antiretroviral treatment 
interruption, but durable remission is sometimes observed when early combined antiretroviral therapy 
(cART) is discontinued.1 Recently, an infant infected by HIV-1 in utero appeared to have been 
“functionally cured” after rapid initiation of cART,2 but viral load rebounded 27 months after cART 
discontinuation.3 We report a case of ongoing virological and immunological control in a perinatally 
infected teenager who discontinued early cART more than 12 years ago. 
 
Since 1996, 173 HIV-infected children were included at birth in the French Pediatric Cohort. One 
hundred children initiated cART before 6 months of age. Among them, 15 patients interrupted cART 
while plasma HIV-RNA was below 500 copies per milliliter and with at least one measurement 
recorded after treatment interruption. These children received cART during a median duration of 33 
months. Thirteen children experienced viral rebound less than 12 months after cART interruption; one 
child maintained virological control for 3 years; one child showed unprecedented long-term virological 
remission. 
 
CASE REPORT 
The child was born in 1996 by spontaneous vaginal delivery at 37 weeks + 5 days of gestation to an 
HIV-1-infected woman who had received zalcitabine monotherapy (instead of zidovudine monotherapy 
because of severe anaemia) from the 13th week of pregnancy. Maternal viral load at delivery was 42 
000 copies per milliliter and the CD4+ T cell count was 81 per cubic millimeter. Intrapartum zidovudine 
prophylaxis was not administered. The newborn received a six-week course of zidovudine, starting on 
the day of birth. Her plasma HIV RNA load was below 1000 copies per milliliter on day 3 of life 
(Supplementary Table 1). HIV DNA was undetectable in her peripheral blood mononuclear cells 
(PBMC) at three days and two weeks of age. PBMC-associated HIV DNA and plasma HIV RNA were 
detected for the first time at respectively one and two months of age (Figure 1). cART consisting of 
zidovudine, lamivudine, didanosine and ritonavir was initiated at three months of age, when the 
plasma HIV RNA load was 2 170 000 copies per milliliter, driving her viral load to below 500 copies per 
milliliter one month later. Between 4 and 6.5 months of age her nucleoside reverse transcriptase 
inhibitors were changed three times because of severe neutropenia. Thereafter, her cART consisted of 
 5 
 
stavudine, didanosine and ritonavir. Her plasma HIV RNA remained undetectable on cART, except for 
two transient rebounds at 15 and 21 months of age. Each time, interventions to improve treatment 
adherence re-established virological control, with undetectable viral load two months later. Between 
5.8 and 6.8 years of age, the family discontinued her medical follow-up and treatment. Because her 
viral load remained undetectable at 6.8 years of age, cART was not resumed. At the ages of 11.6 and 
13.9 years, low and transient viral blips were observed (510 and 48 copies per milliliter, respectively). 
The patient has never exhibited symptoms of HIV infection, and her growth and neurological and 
pubertal development have been normal. Her CD4+ T cell percentage has remained stable. At the 
time of this report, at age 18.6 years, she has received no antiretroviral drugs for more than 12 years. 
 
Between 2013 and 2015, detailed virological and immunological studies were performed to 
characterize this unique case of long-term HIV-1 remission in a vertically infected patient (Case A). 
 
METHODS 
Subjects 
Case A was identified among patients followed up in the ANRS CO10 pediatric cohort as the only with 
long-term HIV remission after treatment interruption.  
Case B was a HIV-infected adolescent followed up in the ANRS CO10 pediatric cohort with 
uncontrolled viremia after treatment discontinuation (CD4 T cell counts of 537 cells/mm3 (20%) and a 
viral load of 1,972 HIV RNA copies/ml at the time of the analysis). This patient was treated (ZDV DDI 
Nelfinavir) since 10 weeks of age for 3.5 years. At the time of the analysis Case B had been off ART 
for 11 years. 
HIC was a treatment naive adult HIV controller from the ANRS CO21 CODEX cohort with a viral load 
controlled below 400 HIV RNA copies/ml of plasma for more than 5 years at the time of the analysis. 
 
Virological monitoring 
HIV-1 antibody testing was performed by Western blot (Biorad New Lav Blot 1, Bio-Rad, Marnes-la-
Coquette, France). Recent plasma samples were tested for HIV RNA with the Ultrasensitive Generic 
HIV-1 RNA Charge Virale kit (Biocentric, Bandol, France) and the Cobas AmpliPrep/COBAS Taqman 
HIV-1 kit version 2.0 (Roche, Paris, France).4 PBMC-associated HIV DNA levels were measured with 
 6 
 
the ultrasensitive Generic HIV DNA Cell kit (Biocentric, Bandol, France).5 The virus was subtyped by 
phylogenetic analysis of the reverse transcriptase gene sequence. 
Pharmacological testing 
At 18.3 years of age, to detect non prescribed cART, commercially available antiretrovirals (at least 15 
different antiretroviral drugs) were measured in the plasma   by liquid chromatography coupled with 
tandem mass spectrometry (Acquity UPLC/TQD, Waters Corporation Milford, MA, USA) using a 
modified method.6  
Immunological studies  
HLA typing was performed by genotype analysis with a standard reverse sequence-specific 
oligonucleotide method (LABType SSO, One Lambda, Canoga Park, USA). 
CD8+ T cell HIV suppressive capacity ex vivo was analyzed as previously described.7,8  For 
intracellular cytokine staining, PBMC were incubated for 6 hours with overlapping peptide pools 
encompassing HIV-1 clade B gag, pol and nef (2 µg/mL; NIH AIDS Reagent Program). Anti-
CD28/anti-CD49d costimulation (1 µl/mL) and the anti-CD107α marker were used in each condition. 
Phorbol myristate acetate (PMA, 80 ng/mL) and ionomycin (1 µg/mL) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Quentin 
Fallavier, France) were used as a positive control. Golgi stop (1 µg/mL; BD Biosciences, Le Pont de 
Claix, France) and Brefeldin A (10 µg/mL; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Quentin Fallavier, France) were added 
30 minutes after the start of all incubations. Cells were then stained with the LIVE/DEAD Fixable Aqua 
Dead Cell Stain kit (Life Technologies, Saint Aubin, France) and anti-CD3 and anti-CD8 antibodies. 
The Cytofix/Cytoperm kit (BD Biosciences, Le Pont de Claix, France) was used for intracellular 
staining of anti-IFN-γ, anti-IL-2 and anti-TNF-α.  
 
Detection and amplification of HIV-1 from peripheral blood CD4+ T cells 
One million CD4+ T cells were activated with phytohemagglutinin (1 µg/mL) and IL-2 (100 IU per 
milliliter). Two days later the cells were washed, mixed with 3x106 pooled PHA-activated CD4+ T cells 
from two healthy donors and cultured for 22 days with IL-2. Viral replication was monitored in the 
culture supernatant by using the Generic HIV-1 RNA Charge Virale test and by p24 ELISA 
(ZeptoMetrix Corporation, Buffalo, USA).

RESULTS 
At 3 days of life, Western blot showed reactivity to all (gp160, gp110, p68, p55, gp41, p40, p34, p25) 
but one (p18) HIV-1 protein. At 17 years of age, Western blot showed strong reactivity to p68, p55, 
p40, p34 and p24, weaker reactivity to gp160 and gp41, and no reactivity to gp110 or p18. HIV RNA 
remained undetectable at 16.9, 18.3 and 18.6 years of age (all <20 copies per milliliter by the Roche 
assay and <9, <4 and <7 copies per milliliter by the Biocentric assay, respectively). PBMC-associated 
HIV DNA levels were stable at 16.7, 16.9, 18.3 and 18.6 years of age, at between 2.1 and 2.5 log10 
copies per million PBMC. These values are within the range observed in adult post-treatment 
controllers of the ANRS VISCONTI study1 and among the lowest observed in untreated perinatally-
infected untreated children10. The virus belonged to HIV-1 subtype H. 
 
At 18.3 years of age, plasma concentrations of all antiretrovirals, measured concomitantly with plasma 
HIV RNA, were below the respective detection limits, confirming the absence of recent cART use.  
 
The HLA genotype was A*2301/-; B*1503/4101; C*0210/08:02; DRB1*1101/-; DQB1*0602/-. T cell 
activation marker expression was normal at 18.3 years of age (respectively 15%, 21% and 12% of T 
cells were CD3+/HLA-DR+, CD8+/HLA-DR+ and CD4+/HLA-DR+).11  CD8+ T cells strongly produced 
all cytokines tested and degranulated in response to PMA and ionomycin stimulation (Figure 2A, case 
A). However, responses to pools of HIV-1 peptides were barely detectable (Figure 2A and 
supplementary figure 1). The HIV-specific response was weaker in the patient than in a viremic 
perinatally infected adolescent (Case B) and an adult HIV controller (HIC) who were evaluated during 
the same period (0.069% of IFNγ+ CD8+ T cells from Case A after stimulation with Gag, Pol and Nef 
pools vs 1.295% for Case B and 1.079% for the HIC) (Figure 2A, and supplementary figure 2). The 
patient's CD8+ T cells showed no capacity to suppress HIV-1 infection of CD4+ T cells (0.23 log p24 
decrease CD4 vs CD4:CD8; 0.77 for Case B and 2.68 for the HIC)(Figure 2C).7,8 In contrast, her HIV-
specific CD4+ T cell response, as estimated in the CD8neg fraction, was within the same range than 
 8 
 
in the Case B control and the HIC (0.22% of IFNγ+ CD4+ T cells from Case A after stimulation with 
Gag, Pol and Nef pools vs 0.128% for Case B and 0.885% for the HIC)(Figure 2D and supplementary 
figure 2). Her HIV-specific T cells did not show superior polyfunctionality (Figures 2B, 2E and 
supplementary figure 3). 
 
After stimulation of CD4+ T cells, HIV-1 RNA and p24 were detected in the culture supernatant at all 
time points (Figure 2F). Her CD4+ T cells were strongly susceptible to infection with HIV-1 Bal in vitro 
(Figure 2C).   
 
DISCUSSION 
We report the case of a perinatally infected teenager who experienced long-term virological remission 
from HIV-1 infection lasting for more than 12 years after cessation of early cART. As HIV DNA and 
HIV RNA were undetectable in her blood at age 3 days, the patient was likely infected very late in 
gestation or during delivery. Of note, we cannot exclude that the AZT-based postnatal prophylaxis 
could have contributed to the late positivity of HIV-1 PCR in the baby. Indeed, in a recent analysis of 
the performance of HIV-1 DNA and HIV-1 RNA tests for early diagnosis of perinatal infection in 1567 
French infants, 11% of infected children had negative PCR results at 1 month during antiretroviral 
prophylaxis12. At 3 months of age, her plasma HIV RNA load was very high and her CD4+ T cell 
percentage severely degraded. This suggested she was infected by a highly replicative and 
pathogenic virus. Although cART rapidly controlled viremia and normalized the CD4+ T cell 
percentage, she experienced two viral rebounds, apparently associated with poor adherence, during 
her second year of life. These episodes showed that the patient was unable to control the virus without 
treatment at this age and thus suggested that her long-term treatment contributed to creating an 
optimal situation in which she could achieve durable remission. 
The HIV-1 subtype that infected our patient (H) is quite uncommon and almost exclusively found in 
central Africa. However, this clade did not seem to contribute to the post-treatment control of HIV 
replication in our patient for two reasons. First, we observed, in our previous reports, similar 
immunovirological features in children13 and adults14 infected with strains clustering with subtype H 
than in patients harbouring more frequent HIV-1 subtypes. Second, the severe immune deficiency 
observed in our patient’s mother at the time of delivery and the high HIV-1 viremia measured in both 
 9 
 
the mother and the baby (before cART initiation) suggested that the transmitted strain was not less 
pathogenic than viruses belonging to more frequent subtypes.  
Several characteristics of this patient resemble those of adult post-treatment HIV-1 controllers (PTCs) 
enrolled in the ANRS VISCONTI study1 but differ from those of adult HIV controllers.15 First, we found 
homozygosity at several HLA loci, which has been previously linked to more rapid disease 
progression.16,17 Generally unfavourable HLA genotypes are also commonly observed in adult PTCs.1 
Second, our patient showed weak T cell activation and HIV-specific CD8+ T cell responses. It should 
be noted that the use of HIV-1 subtype B consensus peptides can underestimate the response in 
subtype H infection, but also that the intensity of the patient's HIV-specific CD4+ T cell responses was 
close to that of the two control patients we analysed. Overall, our results suggest that the CD8+ T cell 
response is not the major force keeping control of viremia in this patient. The precise mechanisms 
associated to post-treatment HIV control remain unclear. Recent data obtained in adult patients from 
the ANRS VISCONTI study suggest that these patients carry NK cells with a particular phenotype and 
enhanced capacity to inhibit HIV infection.18. Whether the innate immune response plays a role in the 
control of infection in the case of this patient remains to be analysed. Another possibility is that early 
initiated and prolonged cART favoured the archiving of less fitted or less inducible viruses. The patient 
still harbors a low frequency of infected cells, from which HIV replication can be induced in vitro, albeit 
with difficulty. Weak contribution of central memory T cells to the HIV-1 reservoir has been reported in 
adult PTCs.1 Although we did not address this issue in our patient, neonates have much lower 
frequencies of central-memory-phenotype CD4+ T cells than adults, and this might protect these cell 
populations from HIV-1 infection during childhood.19,20 Moreover, in children who are treated early, 
transitional memory CD4+ T cells make a larger contribution to the viral reservoir than do longer-
lasting memory CD4+ T cells.21 However, no cases of long-term post-treatment remission have 
previously been reported in children, even in those with very low HIV blood cell reservoir levels before 
cART cessation.22-24 As indefinite antiretroviral therapy is recommended for children, only a very small 
proportion of early-treated, virologically suppressed children therefore undergo treatment interruption, 
which may explain the reported rarity of childhood PTCs worldwide. Moreover, viral suppression on 
cART is more difficult to achieve and sustain in children than in adults,25 and we cannot therefore 
exclude the possibility that a lesser proportion of early-treated children fail to achieve PTC status 
because of poor viral control during treatment.   
 10 
 
 
The “Mississippi child” maintained undetectable viremia for 27.6 months after cART discontinuation.3 
Although cART was also initiated very early, there are noteworthy differences with our patient. First, 
the Mississippi child's plasma HIV RNA load was 19 182 copies per milliliter 31 hours after birth, and 
she may thus have been infected earlier during pregnancy than our patient. Second, our patient was 
exposed longer to viral antigens after delivery, as the Mississippi child started cART immediately and 
had detectable viremia for less than a month. This markedly limited the size of the viral reservoir in the 
Mississippi child, whose HIV DNA levels were lower than in our patient despite much shorter cART. It 
is unknown whether longer exposure to viral antigens, by experiencing the immune system, might be 
important for achieving post-treatment remission. Moreover, because the immune system is immature 
in young children, longer cART might be necessary to achieve an optimal balance between a small 
pool of infected cells and potent specific immune responses. It is also unknown whether the brief 
exposure to the virus during the two brief episodes of viral relapse during the second year of life of the 
patient contributed to the optimal maturation of the immune response against HIV. Finally, it is likely 
that durable HIV-1 remission is associated with intrinsic host and viral factors that are favoured by 
early and lengthy cART.  
 
This case shows that early and prolonged cART might be followed by off-therapy viral control lasting 
several years in some perinatally infected children with no known features associated with natural 
control. A better understanding of the underlying mechanisms might lead to therapeutic approaches 
that enable more perinatally infected patients to discontinue treatment and achieve HIV-1 remission for 
long periods.

FIGURE LEGENDS 
Figure 1. Monitoring of HIV-1 viral load and CD4+ T cell counts in the child. 
HIV-1 RNA load (circles) and CD4+ T cell percentages (triangles) during the entire follow-up period, 
from birth to age 18.6 years. Red circles indicate detectable HIV-1 RNA levels. Blue circles indicate 
the assay detection limit in case of undetectable viral load. Shaded areas indicate the periods during 
which the child received antiretroviral drugs. ZDV denotes zidovudine, DDI didanosine, 3TC 
lamivudine, RTV ritonavir, and D4T stavudine. 
 
Figure 2. HIV-specific T cell responses after >10 years of remission 
Panels A and D show the frequencies of CD8+ T cells and CD8- T cells producing interferon gamma 
(IFNγ) in response to PMA/ionomycin stimulation and to pools of gag, pol and nef peptides. The test 
was performed simultaneously in the patient (Case A, light gray columns), a viremic perinatally 
infected adolescent (Case B, dark gray columns) and an adult natural HIV controller (HIC, blue 
columns). Panels B and E show the relative capacity of CD8+ T cells and CD4+ T cells from the same 
three patients to concomitantly exert (in response to a pool of gag peptides) one, two, three or four 
functions (IFN-γ, IL-2 and TNF-α production and degranulation marker CD107α expression). The size 
of the circles is proportional to the cumulative total response. Panel C shows the levels of HIV-1 p24 
detected in culture supernatants after superinfection with HIV-1 BaL of CD4+ T cells from the HIC, the 
case A patient and the Case B, cultured without or with autologous CD8+ T cells (CD4:CD8 ratio 1:1). 
The mean and standard deviation of three replicates are shown. Panel F shows levels of autologous 
HIV-1 RNA (maximum 7810 copies per milliliter, in blue) and p24 (maximum 122 pg per milliliter, in 
black) in culture supernatants after stimulation of CD4+ T cells from Case A patient with 
phytohemagglutinin. Heterologous feeder CD4+ T cells were added to the culture on day 7. p24 
production after activation of CD4+ T cells from Case B patient are shown as a reference (empty 
triangles, dot lines).
