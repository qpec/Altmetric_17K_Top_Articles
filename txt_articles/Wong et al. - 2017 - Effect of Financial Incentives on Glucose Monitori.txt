IMPORTANCE Glycemic control often deteriorates during adolescence and the transition to
young adulthood for patients with type 1 diabetes. The inability to manage type 1 diabetes
effectively during these years is associated with poor glycemic control and complications
from diabetes in adult life.
OBJECTIVE To determine the effect of daily financial incentives on glucose monitoring
adherence and glycemic control in adolescents and young adults with type 1 diabetes.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The Behavioral Economic Incentives to Improve
Glycemic Control Among Adolescents and Young Adults With Type 1 Diabetes (BE IN
CONTROL) study was an investigator-blinded, 6-month, 2-arm randomized clinical trial
conducted between January 22 and November 2, 2016, with 3-month intervention and
follow-up periods. Ninety participants (aged 14-20) with suboptimally controlled type 1
diabetes (hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c] >8.0%) were recruited from the Diabetes Center for
Children at the Children’
s Hospital of Philadelphia.
INTERVENTIONS All participants were given daily blood glucose monitoring goals of 4 or
more checks per day with 1 or more level within the goal range (70-180 mg/dL) collected
with a wireless glucometer. The 3-month intervention consisted of a $60 monthly incentive
in a virtual account, from which $2 was subtracted for every day of nonadherence to the
monitoring goals. During a 3-month follow-up period, the intervention was discontinued.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was change in HbA1c levels at
3 months. Secondary outcomes included adherence to glucose monitoring and change in
HbA1c levels at 6 months. All analyses were by intention to treat.
RESULTS Of the 181 participants screened, 90 (52 [57.8%] girls) were randomized to the
intervention (n = 45) or control (n = 45) arms. The mean (SD) age was 16.3 (1.9) years. The
intervention group had significantly greater adherence to glucose monitoring goals in the
incentive period (50.0% vs 18.9%; adjusted difference, 27.2%; 95% CI, 9.5% to 45.0%;
P = .003) but not in the follow-up period (15.3% vs 8.7%; adjusted difference, 3.9%; 95% CI,
−2.0% to 9.9%; P = .20). The change in HbA1c levels from baseline did not differ significantly
between groups at 3 months (adjusted difference, −0.08%; 95% CI, −0.69% to 0.54%;
P = .80) or 6 months (adjusted difference, 0.03%; 95% CI, −0.55% to 0.60%; P = .93).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among adolescents and young adults with type 1 diabetes,
daily financial incentives improved glucose monitoring adherence during the incentive period
but did not significantly improve glycemic control.

lycemic control in type 1 diabetes often deteriorates
during adolescence and the transition to young adult-
hood with increased risks of acute and long-term
complications.1,2 This poor control is attributed to difficul-
ties with adhering to the prescribed medical regimen.2-4
These challenges occur in the context of decreasing parental
involvement and developing psychosocial maturity.5-7
As young people prepare to transition to adult models of care
that require independent self-management skills, interven-
tions that empower them to successfully manage chronic
disease can improve outcomes.6
Daily glucose monitoring is fundamental to achieving
glycemic control in type 1 diabetes since glucose level
awareness dictates insulin dose adjustment, eating behav-
iors, and physical activity. A number of interventions have
targeted increased monitoring as a means of achieving bet-
ter control.3,8,9 However, many interventions in adolescents
and young adults that utilized family-related interventions,
motivational interviews, text messages, and training in dia-
betes management skills have demonstrated relatively small
effects (eg, mean effect of 0.5% drop in hemoglobin A1c
[HbA1c]).3,10,11
Behavioral economics is a field of study that applies
economic and psychological principles, such as immediate
gratification and loss aversion, to overcome barriers to
behavior change. Behavioral economic interventions utiliz-
ing financial incentives have been used to increase adher-
ence to chronic disease management regimens in adult
populations but have not yet been widely tested in adoles-
cents and young adults.12-16 One feasibility trial with 51 ado-
lescents and young adults with type 1 diabetes established
acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy of
increased monitoring with financial incentives that were
contingent or noncontingent on meeting glucose monitor-
ing goals.17 Two small studies (17 and 10 participants) with-
out control groups used incentives (eg, $0.10 for each test
with a bonus for 4 checks per day) for glucose testing in
youth; both studies showed improved glucose monitoring
adherence and HbA1c levels.18,19 Financial incentives have
been proposed but have infrequently been tested in other
adolescent health domains, such as exercise, nutrition,
sexual health, and preventive behaviors for sun exposure
and smoking.12,16,20-25 To our knowledge, no study has
tested loss-aversion incentives among adolescents and
young adults for self-monitoring behaviors.
In this randomized clinical trial, we sought to determine
among adolescents and young adults with type 1 diabetes
if daily financial incentives could improve adherence
to daily glucose monitoring goals and glycemic control.
To monitor adherence and provide incentives in real time,
we used wireless glucometer devices, which are readily
accepted by people in this age group.26 Such devices allow
remote self-monitoring with minimal additional effort,
especially when combined with enhanced engagement
strategies, such as financial incentives.13,27 Home-based
monitoring is particularly attractive for adolescents and
young adults who tend to access outpatient care less
frequently.28,29
Methods
Study Design and Participants
The Behavioral Economic Incentives to Improve Glycemic
Control Among Adolescents and Young Adults With Type 1
Diabetes (BE IN CONTROL) study was a 6-month randomized
clinical trial conducted between January 22 and November 2,
2016, with 3-month intervention and follow-up periods. We
enrolled 90 participants who were randomly assigned to an
incentive intervention or control arm. The protocol is re-
ported in Supplement 1. The Children’
s Hospital of Philadel-
phia and The University of Pennsylvania institutional review
boards approved this study. All participants provided elec-
tronic informed consent (≥18 years) and/or assent (14-17 years)
with parental permission. Participants received $20 for en-
rolling and $30 if they completed the HbA1c monitoring and
surveys at the end of the intervention and follow-up periods.
Participantswereaged14to20yearsandhadreceivedcare
for type 1 diabetes for at least 1 year at the Children’
s Hospital
of Philadelphia Diabetes Center for Children. Those with sub-
optimal glycemic control (defined as most recent HbA1c>8.0%
[to convert to percentage of total Hb, multiply by 0.01]) were
eligible if they had email access, had a smartphone, and were
English speaking.
Participants were recruited between October 27, 2015, and
May 6, 2016, by emailing and/or posting letters to all patients
aged 14 to 20 years with type 1 diabetes who received care at
the Children’
s Hospital of Philadelphia (approximately 1160
people), as well as by contacting them by telephone or in per-
sonattheirdiabetescarevisits.Theywereexcludediftheywere

Key Points
Question Do daily financial incentives improve adherence to daily
glucose monitoring goals and glycemic control among adolescents
and young adults with type 1 diabetes during a 3-month
intervention?
Findings In a randomized clinical trial including 90 adolescents
and young adults with poorly controlled type 1 diabetes, daily
financial incentives improved glucose monitoring in the
intervention group (50.0%) vs the control group (18.9%) but did
not affect their glycemic control.
Meaning Financial incentives showed promise for improving
glucose monitoring behaviors among adolescents and young
adults with type 1 diabetes.

 email, and intervention delivery and data capture.34 Partici-
pantswererandomlyassignedtothecontrolorincentivegroup
using a block size of 6 and stratified by baseline HbA1c (8.0%-
10.0% vs >10.0%). All investigators, statisticians, and data ana-
lysts were blinded to group assignments until the end of the
study and all analyses. Participants and the study coordina-
tor could not be blinded to arm assignment.
Procedures
Allparticipantsweregivendailybloodglucosemonitoringgoals
of 4 glucose level checks per day (separated by ≥2 hours) with
at least 1 reading within the target range (70-180 mg/dL per the
American Diabetes Association [to convert to millimoles per
liter, multiply by 0.0555]).35 We incentivized a within-range
blood glucose reading to encourage monitoring and appropri-
ate responses to high glucose level readings.
Each participant was given a glucometer (iHealth Smart
Wireless Gluco-Monitoring System; iHealth) and test strips for
the duration of the study. This glucometer syncs with a smart-
phone application via Bluetooth. Participants were enrolled
only after they synced their first glucose level reading.
We designed the daily financial incentives as loss framed
based on prior work on the motivating potential of loss
aversion.15,36-40 Participants randomized to the intervention
arm were credited $60 in a virtual account at the beginning of
each month during the 3-month (13-week) incentive period;
they lost $2 for each day of nonadherence to the glucose moni-
toringgoals.Interventionarmparticipantsreceiveddailymoni-
toring and incentive feedback during the incentive period by
emailortextmessage(pertheirpreference).Forexample,“You
met your glucose monitoring goals yesterday. Keep it up! You
have $60 remaining in your account,” or “Sorry, you did not
meet your glucose monitoring goal yesterday (at least 4 checks
with 1 in target range). You lost $2 from your account. Remain-
ing balance = $58.” Participants in the intervention arm re-
ceived their remaining virtual account balance at the end of
each incentive month on a reloadable debit card. The incen-
tives were discontinued during the follow-up period.
Participants obtained an HbA1c level within 3 weeks of the
end of the intervention (at 3 months) and follow-up (at 6
months) periods, most often during their usual diabetes clinic
visits. Online surveys were administered at the end of the in-
tervention and follow-up periods.
In addition, a sample of 20 intervention arm participants
were interviewed via telephone after completing the study.
Semistructured interviews included questions on financial in-
centives, connected glucometers, and study feedback. Inter-
views were recorded and transcribed. Responses to the semi-
structured interview questions were analyzed using thematic
content analysis by 2 of us (C.A.W. and A.M.) independently.41
Outcomes
The primary outcome measure was the change in HbA1c lev-
els at 3 months compared with baseline. Secondary outcome
measuresincludedadherencetodailyglucosemonitoringgoals
duringtheincentiveandfollow-upperiodsandchangeinHbA1c
levels at 6 months vs baseline. Adherence to daily glucose
monitoring goals was measured as the mean proportion of
participant-days achieving the daily blood glucose monitor-
ing goals. Themes from the interviews were identified.
Statistical Analysis
A priori sample size calculations were based on a clinically
relevant HbA1c difference of 1.0 between the intervention
and control groups. Assuming an HbA1c SD of 1.5, power of
0.80, 2-sided significance of P = .05, and 20% dropout rate,
we estimated a sample of 90 participants (45 per arm).
For each participant on each day of the study (participant-
day level), we obtained their glucose level readings. Data could
be missing for any day if a participant did not use the study
glucometer, although patients had the opportunity to manu-
ally enter readings from other glucometers (eg, at school).
Manually entered glucose level readings (18% of all study read-
ings)weretracked,andnosuspiciouspatternsforcheatingwere
detected.Wedichotomizedthedataattheparticipant-daylevel
to create a binary variable indicating that the participant
achieved the daily blood glucose monitoring goals or did not.
Using this binary variable, we estimated the mean proportion
of participant-days achieving the goal for the group of partici-
pants in each study group during the intervention and
follow-up periods and for each week during the study. All ran-
domly assigned participants were included in the intention-
to-treat analysis.
Mean change in HbA1c levels from baseline was calcu-
lated by arm at 3 and 6 months in separate unadjusted and ad-
justedmodels.Intheadjustedmodel,wefitaprespecifiedgen-
eralized linear regression for the change in HbA1c level,
controlling for the same baseline type 1 diabetes and demo-
graphic characteristics listed above plus calendar month fixed
effects and interval from baseline to 3- and 6-month HbA1c lev-
els (eTable 1 in Supplement 2). We used multiple imputation
to generate values for participants missing 3-month (n = 5) and
6-month (n = 11) HbA1c level measurements with the follow-
ingpredictorsin5imputations:studyarm,baselineHbA1clevel,

justed analyses), baseline type 1 diabetes measures/scales
(HbA1c level, insulin regimen, number of daily glucose checks,
complications, hypoglycemic event frequency, self-efficacy
scale, adherence to diabetes regimen scale, and diabetes sup-
port scale), and calendar month. Results were combined using
the Rubin standard rules.42 The imputed analyses were quali-
tatively similar to the nonimputed analyses (eTable 2 in
Supplement 2). The correlation between adherence quartiles
and change in HbA1c levels was evaluated by Kruskal-Wallis
tests by study arm.
We estimated the unadjusted proportion of participant-
days adherent to the blood glucose monitoring goals for each
arm and the difference between the means for the 2 arms for
the incentive period, the follow-up period, and for each week
during the study.

 fixed effects. Bootstrap methodology, which resampled par-
ticipants within each arm 150 times, was used to construct the
95% CIs for the probability of achieving the goals.43
All statistical analyses were performed using R, version
3.2.3 (R Foundation). All hypothesis tests were 2-sided, and a
significance level of P = .05 was used.
Results
We enrolled 90 participants (Figure 1). Among the 91 youths
assessed for eligibility but not randomized, age and baseline
HbA1c levels were available for 55 and 76 participants, respec-
tively. The mean age of nonenrolled (16.5 years) and enrolled
(16.3 years) participants were similar, and the mean HbA1c level
of nonenrolled participants was lower (8.63%), in part be-
cause HbA1c ≤8.0% was the most common inclusion criteria
not met.
The majority of participants identified as white non-
Hispanic and were full-time students, covered by private in-
surance, and living with family (Table 1). The mean baseline
HbA1c level was 9.88% in the control arm and 9.84% in the in-
tervention arm.
Glucose Monitoring Goals
Theproportionofparticipant-daysachievingtheglucosemoni-
toring goals during the 3-month incentive period was 18.9%
in the control group vs 50.0% in the intervention group (ad-
justed difference, 27.2%; 95% CI, 9.5% to 45.0%; P = .003)
(Table 2). Adherence to glucose monitoring goals decreased in

(adjusted difference, −0.08%; 95% CI, −0.69% to 0.54%;
P = .80) or 6 months (adjusted difference, 0.03%; 95% CI,
−0.55% to 0.60%; P = .93) (Table 2). We also found no signifi-
cant correlation between quartiles of adherence to glucose
monitoring and change in HbA1c levels (eFigure 2 in
Supplement 2).
Participant Perspectives
Participants in the intervention group had positive feedback
on the feasibility of daily financial incentives and mixed per-
spectivesontheidealincentiveamountandstructure(Table3).
Those who favored loss aversion incentives were motivated
by the loss of money that they believed was already theirs and
the cumulative money lost for repeated nonadherent days.
While some believed gain incentives (ie, winning money for
meeting the daily monitoring goals) would have been better,
others proposed alternative incentive structures, such as bo-
nuses (“If you had a week of not losing any money, maybe get
anextracouplebucksjustforareward.
”)orwhatanothercalled
“a multiplier effect” (“The first day you would lose $2.00 and
the second day you could lose $4.00. So, if you continue to
miss, it would rise at an exponential level.”). Others men-
tioned that the extrinsic financial rewards helped them to re-
alize the intrinsic value of taking care of their type 1 diabetes.
When asked about what study components were helpful,
the most common response from both arms (36% of partici-
pants) was the connected glucometers and smartphone ap-
plication. Participants liked tracking, interpreting, and shar-
ing glucose readings on the application (Table 3).
Participants noted that glucose monitoring incentives
did not always motivate other behaviors necessary for
improved glycemic control, such as appropriate responses to
high glucose level readings or accurate carbohydrate count-
ing. Other HbA1c-relevant issues that participants identified
were insulin regimen changes and life stressors (eg, busy
school semester).
Discussion
In our study of adolescents and young adults with type 1 dia-
betes, financial incentives showed promise for improving dia-
betesself-monitoringbehaviors.Dailyfinancialincentiveswere
effective in increasing adherence to blood glucose monitor-
ing goals during the incentive period, but this adherence did
not lead to an improvement in glycemic control. Those ex-
posed to the daily incentives were more than twice as likely
to meet their daily blood glucose monitoring goals. These im-
provements are noteworthy given that eligibility was limited
to youth with poor control, who have historically been diffi-
cult to engage in treatment.44
This is one of the first studies to demonstrate that finan-
cial incentives for adolescents and young adults can motivate
behavior change. Our participants identified the loss aver-
sion financial incentives, particularly the cumulative losses,
as important in motivating their increased daily blood glu-
cose monitoring. While we based the loss aversion structure
and amount of $2 per day on prior work in adults, further re-
search is needed to determine how financial incentives might
best be tailored to young people.15,27,36-39 For example, other
financial incentive structures, such as those suggested by par-
ticipants (eg, multiplier effect), may be more effective in sus-
taining the effect in the incentive and follow-up periods.
Unique opportunities exist for implementing financial in-
centives in youth, who are often financially dependent on oth-
ers. For example, parents could allow a desired privilege (eg,
later curfew) or purchase (eg, cell phone data plan) contin-
gent on meeting type 1 diabetes care goals. Financial incen-
tives may also be effective for behaviors critical for other
chronic health conditions in youth, such as medication ad-
herenceinthosewhohavereceivedtransplantsorhaveasthma.
Increaseddailybloodglucosemonitoringwiththerequire-
ment that at least 1 level per day be within the target range did
not translate to significant decreases in HbA1c levels. These

Gain vs loss
framing of
incentives
“I don’t like to lose anything…something I would
consider almost a possession. I already have $60.00 and
then that’s the equivalent of having three $20.00 bills
and every time you miss, somebody comes over and says
‘
ha,’ you owe me $2.00.”
“I think [being able to win money] would be much
better, because it was kind of stressful seeing all the
money go away… it's probably easier to keep track of
too, just adding the $2.00.”
Cumulative effect
of loss incentives
“If I had a bad day, I didn’t lose too much. But if I had a
really bad week, then I would lose a lot of money, and it
was really just when things started stacking up. Then
that’s when I kind of realized that I need to get it
together and start checking my blood sugar more or
taking care of my diabetes better.”
Personal
responsibility
“The money gave some encouragement to test myself,
but after a little, it was more about testing myself for
me and not the money.”
Wireless, Smartphone-Connected Glucometers
Tracking and
visualizing trends
“The biggest thing that's helpful is that [the glucometer]
translates data onto my phone, which lets me visually
see trends.”
“I don’t really go back and look through my [old] meter
to look at my numbers. So if you were to ask me, I
wouldn’t know. But because I had the meter that hooked
up to my phone, I had a list of all my numbers which was
helpful.”
Ubiquitous phone
use
“I was just always on my phone and I saw the app, it
would kind of remind myself oh, maybe I should check
my blood sugar now even though I wouldn’t typically be
thinking of something like that.”
Ability to easily
share glucose data
“I liked that I could connect my glucometer to other
phones so my mother didn't have to call and ask me. She
got updates sent to her phone, and it was up-to-date
technology.”
Correlation Between Adherence to Glucose Monitoring and Change in HbA1c
Believed increased
glucose
monitoring led to
improved glycemic
control
Participant with 2.2% HbA1c drop after incentive period:
“I think that mostly it was the fact that I was checking
my glucose more than I used to that really helped.”
Reasons for
imperfect
correlation
between glucose
monitoring and
HbA1c
“…because a lot of the times, I can just test my sugar
and not do my insulin because it’s in another room or
I’m busy doing something.”
Participant with 0.8% HbA1c increase after incentive
period: “I started [the study] during the second semester
of school last year…school kinda makes my blood sugars
go all over the place, and there’s just a lot of
stressfulness with my semester last year.”

 monitoring goals may not have been sufficiently stringent to
achieve an effect on HbA1c. In general, achieving substantial
improvements in glycemic control has been challenging across
multicomponent interventions promoting adherence in indi-
viduals with type 1 diabetes.10,11
In contrast to prior studies, we did not identify a correla-
tion between blood glucose monitoring frequency and glyce-
miccontrol.3,8,9Participantsidentifiedseveralfactorsthatthey
believed had a greater effect on HbA1c than adherence to glu-
cose monitoring (eg, inadequate responses to high glucose lev-
els, schedule predictability). The multifactorial influences on
glycemic control suggest that future studies should test in-
centivizingboththeprocess(eg,glucosemonitoringwithmore
readingswithinthegoalrange)andtheoutcome(eg,HbA1clevel
improvement). Adding social incentives (eg, social networks,
relative social ranking) to the intervention could further im-
prove outcomes; diabetes adherence promotion interven-
tions that targeted behavioral (eg, blood glucose monitoring)
and social processes were more potent in a meta-analysis.10
In our study, the increased level of blood glucose moni-
toring more rapidly declined after the incentives were re-
moved.Whilelonger-termhabitformationistheultimategoal,
preventing serious health deterioration from chronic disease
would be a valuable intermediate accomplishment for adoles-
cents and young adults, who are in a developmentally critical
transition period.2,45
Although this study did not test the effect of smartphone-
connected glucometers, participants in both arms were gen-
erally positive about the devices. These glucometers with au-
tomated data entry and aggregation on an application may
contribute to empowering and educating participants. Given
ubiquitous smartphone use, connected glucometers could
make self-management more convenient and engaging for
young people with type 1 diabetes.26
Limitations
Our findings should be viewed in light of several limitations.
The small sample size from a single site may limit generaliz-
ability and subgroup analyses, for example, by race/ethnicity
or socioeconomic status.46 Participants were also required to
have a smartphone, although more than three-quarters of ado-
lescents and young adults have access to a smartphone.47 The
differencesinadherencetodailyglucosemonitoringgoalsmay
be explained in part by missing glucose level readings if par-
ticipantsusedotherglucometers.However,ourqualitativedata
suggest that participants in both arms valued the study glu-
cometer’
sfeaturesandcouldmanuallyenterglucoselevelread-
ings if needed. Finally, the intervention included email or text
notifications. Given the daily loss-framed incentive design, it
was not possible to disentangle the effects of incentives and
messaging. Nonetheless, many participants stated that the
financial incentives, in and of themselves, were motivating.
Conclusions
The inability to manage type 1 diabetes effectively during the
adolescent and young adult years is associated with poor
glycemic control and complications in adult life.48 Identify-
ing interventions that empower young people to manage their
disease effectively is crucial. Financial incentives and smart-
phone-connected glucometers proved to be promising tools
that deserve further exploration in adolescents and young
adults with type 1 diabetes.
