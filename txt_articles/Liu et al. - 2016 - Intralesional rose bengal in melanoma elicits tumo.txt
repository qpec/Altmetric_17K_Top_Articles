ABSTRACT
Intralesional (IL) therapy is under investigation to treat dermal and subcutaneous 
metastatic cancer. Rose bengal (RB) is a staining agent that was originally used by 
ophthalmologists and in liver function studies. IL injection of RB has been shown to 
induce regression of injected and uninjected tumors in murine models and clinical 
trials. In this study, we have shown a mechanism of tumor-specific immune response 
induced by IL RB. In melanoma-bearing mice, IL RB induced regression of injected 
tumor and inhibited the growth of bystander lesions mediated by CD8+ T cells. IL 
RB resulted in necrosis of tumor cells and the release of High Mobility Group Box 1 
(HMGB1), with increased dendritic cell (DC) infiltration into draining lymph nodes 
and the activation of tumor-specific T cells. Treatment of DC with tumor supernatants 
increased the ability of DCs to stimulate T cell proliferation, and blockade of HMGB1 
in the supernatants suppressed DC activity. Additionally, increased HMGB1 levels 
were measured in the sera of melanoma patients treated with IL RB. These results 
support the role of IL RB to activate dendritic cells at the site of tumor necrosis for 
the induction of a systemic anti-tumor immune response.
INTRODUCTION
Immunotherapeutic strategies incorporating intrale­
sional (IL) therapy to elicit tumor-specific immune resp-
onses constitute a viable option for cutaneous neoplasms. 
These strategies can induce both local and systemic tumor 
regression. Intratumoral injection of dendritic cells (DCs), 
IL­2, GM­CSF, or Bacille Calmette­Guérin (BCG) have 
been shown to enhance anti­tumor immunity in both 
melanoma­bearing mice and in patients with advanced 
melanoma [1–6].
Rose bengal (RB) was originally used as a staining 
agent by ophthalmologists and in liver function studies 
[7, 8]. RB has a direct cytotoxic effect on microorganisms 
and cancer cells [9–15]. In tumor cells, RB selectively 
passes through the cell membrane and accumulates in 
the lysosomes resulting in autolysis [10]. IL injection of 
RB (also referred to as PV­10, an investigational drug 
formulation of 10% RB in normal saline) into tumors 
has been shown to elicit regression of both treated and 
untreated tumors [12, 16]. In murine models, IL PV­10 
induced T cell mediated tumor-specific immune responses 
in MT901 breast cancer and in B16 melanoma [16]. In a 
phase I study in metastatic melanoma patients, IL PV­10 
was well tolerated and led to a 48% objective response 
(OR) in treated lesions and a 27% OR in untreated lesions

[12]. A recent phase II clinical trial of PV­10 demonstrated 
a similar OR in treated and untreated lesions [17]. 
Additional evidence of systemic response was supported 
by the regression of untreated visceral lesions in a few 
patients. However, the underlying mechanism of induction 
of tumor immunity remains unknown.
Dying cancer cells release soluble molecules known 
as Damage­Associated Molecular Pattern Molecules 
(DAMPs), which are recognized by pattern recognition 
receptors (PRRs) [18]. DAMPs serve as powerful 
immunological adjuvants for cancer therapy. DAMPs 
can promote phagocytosis, antigen­presentation, and 
inflammasome activation in DCs, collectively fostering 
T cell priming against antigens [19]. DAMPs include 
members of the Heat Shock Protein (HSP) family, the 
S100 proteins, ATP, IL-1α, and High Mobility Group 
Box 1 (HMGB1, amphoterin) [20–25]. As the best 
characterized DAMP, HMGB1 is a ubiquitous protein 
bound to DNA in almost all eukaryotic cells. It can be 
membrane­bound or secreted into the extracellular space 
as a cytokine­like factor, or can be passively released by 
necrotic, apoptotic and autophagic cells [26–29]. HMGB1 
release by dying tumor cells can lead to the activation of 
DCs and prevention of tumor progression [25, 30–32]. 
HMGB1 putative receptors include the Receptor for 
Advanced Glycation End­products (RAGE), Toll­like 
Receptor 2 (TLR2), TLR4 and T cell immunoglobulin and 
mucin protein 3 (TIM­3) [33–35].
In this study, we investigated whether IL PV­
10 leads to the release of DAMPs contributing to the 
induction of an anti­tumor immune response.
RESULTS
IL PV-10 elicits a tumor-specific immune 
response
To investigate the underlying mechanism of the 
tumor-specific immune response elicited by PV-10, 
C57BL/6 mice were injected subcutaneously (s.c.) with 
M05 tumor cells expressing the ovalbumin (OVA) protein 
[36]. Similar to our previous findings in the B16 model, 
IL injection of PV­10 directly inhibited tumor growth 
(Figure 1A) [16]. Moreover, IL PV­10 led to increased 
OVA-specific CD8+ T cells in the draining lymph nodes 
(DLNs) of PV­10­treated mice, compared to the PBS­
treated group (Figure 1B). To determine whether IL 
PV­10 induced T cells with memory characteristics, 
splenocytes from mice treated twice with IL PV­10 
were cultured in vitro in the presence of OVA peptide 
and media supplemented with the cytokines IL­15 and 
IL­21, which are required for maintaining CD8+ T 
memory cells [37]. T cells from PV­10­treated mice 
demonstrated a ca. 2 fold increase in secretion of IFN-γ 
in response to M05 cells, compared to T cells isolated 
from PBS-treated mice (Figure 1C). To further confirm 
the induction of memory T cells, spleens, lymph nodes 
(LNs), and tumors were collected from mice 10 days 
after IL PBS or PV­10 injection. Memory T cells (CD44hi 
CD62Lhi and CD44hi CD62low) were increased in the LNs 
and spleens of mice treated with PV­10 compared to mice 
treated with PBS (Figure 1D). In contrast, there were 
decreased T memory cells in bystander tumors of treated 
mice. These results suggest that IL PV­10 can induce 
tumor-specific T cells with memory characteristics in 
M05 melanoma­bearing mice.
We next investigated whether CD8+ T cells 
mediate the tumor-specific immune response elicited by 
IL injection of PV­10. Using a lung metastasis model 
described previously, mice received B16F10 cells s.c. 
on day 0 to establish a solitary tumor on the flank and 
B16­F10­luc cells intravenously (i.v.) to establish multiple 
lung lesions [16]. On day 7, the palpable flank tumors 
were treated IL with 50 μl PBS or PV-10. Tumors in the 
lungs were monitored by bioluminescent imaging on day 
21 (Figure 1E). All mice that received IL PBS displayed 
growth of tumor in the flank and multiple lung lesions. 
In contrast, mice that received IL PV­10 developed fewer 
lung lesions (Figure 1F, p<0.05 compared to PBS­treated 
mice). To examine the role of CD8+ T cells, mice received 
a CD8 depleting antibody (clone 2.43) or the isotype 
antibody (Rat IgG). After depletion of CD8+ T cells, mice 
receiving IL PV­10 developed equivalent numbers of 
lung lesions compared to mice receiving PBS treatment 
(Figure 1F). These results show that CD8+ T cells are 
crucial for the tumor-specific immune response induced 
by IL injection of PV­10.
To monitor CD8+ T cell responses in vivo, PV­10 
or PBS was IL injected into s.c. M05 tumors on day 13, 
followed by injection of violet­dye labeled OT­1 cells. 
The average tumor size was 50 mm2 on day 13 yielding 
sufficient tumor material to dissect for examination of T cell 
proliferation after IL PV­10. OT­1 T cells are CD8+ T cells 
that specifically recognize the SIINFEKL peptide derived 
from the OVA protein. Adoptive transfer of OT­1 cells 
alone or treatment with IL PV-10 alone was not sufficient 
to prevent tumor growth when treatment began at day 13. 
The combination of IL injection of PV­10 and transfer of 
OT-1 cells significantly reduced tumor progression and 
increased survival (Figure 2A–2B). We next measured the 
proliferation of OT­1 T cells in tumors, LNs, and spleens 
after IL PV­10 injection. In the spleens of PV­10 treated 
mice, on day 4 after transfer, more than 60% of OT­1 T 
cells demonstrated at least one division, hereafter called 
“divided” T cells (Figure 2C, left panel). In contrast, there 
were fewer divided T cells in the spleens of PBS­treated 
mice (Figure 2C, right panel). IL PV­10­treated mice 
exhibited increased proliferation of OT­1 T cells in the 
spleen compared to mice treated with IL PBS (Figure 2D). 
However, when PV­10 was injected s.c. into the opposite 
flank where there was no tumor, proliferation of OT-1 T 
cells was equivalent to proliferation of OT­1 T cells in mice

that received PBS in either the opposite flank or IL into 
tumor. At the tumor site, OT­1 cells robustly proliferated 
in PV­10­ or PBS­treated mice (Figure 2E). This may be 
due to the relatively high OVA protein expression by the 
M05 tumor. A robust OT­1 T cell proliferation was also 
observed in the tumor draining LNs and no difference was 
seen between PBS­ and PV­10­treated mice (Figure 2F). 
Differences in OT­1 T cell proliferation were measured 
in the non­draining LNs of mice treated with IL PV­10 
compared to mice treated with IL PBS or treated on the 
opposite flank (Figure 2G). These data suggest that IL PV-
10 can enhance T cell proliferation.

M05 cells (3e5) were injected into one flank of C57BL/6 mice on day 0. On day 13, 50 μl PV-10 or PBS were injected IL or s.c. in the

(B) of mice were monitored (n=5 mice / group). After 4 days, cells from spleens (C, D), tumors (E), draining LNs (F) and non-draining LNs 
(G) were stained with CD45.1 and CD45.2 antibodies. Representative histograms of violet dye dilution show the progenies of CD45.1+

measured in the bystander (right flank) tumor. Data are presented as mean ± SEM from two independent experiments. P values were 
determined by an unpaired student t­test (A, D­H) or a log­rank test (B). *p< 0.05 versus control; **p<0.01.

Next, we examined whether IL PV­10 increased the 
infiltration of T cells into tumors. As IL PV-10 can ablate 
injected tumor, a bilateral tumor model was used to monitor 
the T cell infiltration. Bilateral M05 tumors were established 
in C57BL/6 mice. After 7 days, mice received IL PV­10 in the 
left flank tumor, and four hours later were i.v. injected with 
OT­1 cells. Four days later, bystander tumors were collected 
and T cell infiltration was measured. As shown in Figure 2H, 
there was a significant increase in T cells infiltrating the 
bystander tumor. Together, these data support that IL injection 
of PV-10 can boost T cell infiltration in tumors.
IL PV-10 leads to DC activation
Because DCs are capable of priming T cells, we next 
examined DCs in the spleens and LNs of mice treated with 
IL PV­10. At 24 hours after IL PV­10 injection, the number 
of infiltrating DCs increased in both draining LNs (DLNs) 
and non­draining LNs (NDLNs) (Figure 3A). The overall 
total number of cells in the LNs was not significantly 
changed after treatment. After 72 hours, the number of 
infiltrating DCs in DLN of PV-10-treated mice decreased 
to the baseline level and was equivalent to the level in the 
PBS­treated mice (data not shown), suggesting that the 
infiltration of DCs is transient. To examine whether DCs 
migrated from the site of tumor, OVA protein labeled with 
FITC (FITC­OVA) was directly injected into tumor 4 hours 
after IL injection of PV­10 or PBS. After 18 hours, lymph 
nodes were collected. We measured increased FITC+ DCs in 
the DLNs but not in the NDLNs of the PV­10­treated mice 
(Figure 3B). To assess DC activation, DLNs were collected 
from M05 bearing mice treated with IL PV­10 or PBS. DCs 
were enriched and stained with co­stimulatory markers. DCs 
isolated from the DLNs of IL PV­10 treated mice expressed 
higher levels of activation markers, including CD40, CD86 
and CD80, compared to PBS­treated mice (Figure 3C–3D). 
Together, these studies support a role for IL PV­10 to induce 
DCs to take up antigens at the tumor site, infiltrate into the 
DLN, and become functionally mature.
We next tested whether IL injection of PV­10 led 
to DC activation. Bone marrow cell (BM)­derived DCs 
were co­cultured with supernatants of M05 tumors that 
were previously treated with IL PV­10 or PBS. DCs were 
then pulsed with OVA protein and co­cultured with OT­1 
T cells. DCs cultured with supernatants derived from M05 
tumors isolated from PV­10­treated mice induced increased 
proliferation of OT­1 T cells, compared to DCs cultured 
with supernatants derived from M05 tumors from PBS­
treated mice (Figure 3E). These results suggest that PV­10­
treated tumors may release factors that activate DCs.
PV-10 treatment increases DC activation 
via HMGB1
To examine whether tumor death induced by IL PV­10 
is linked to the activation of DCs, we first investigated 
how PV­10 induces cell death. As shown in Figure 4A, 
PV­10 resulted in a dose­dependent cytotoxicity in B16 
melanoma cells, with an IC50 value of 60 μM after 48 
hours of treatment. There was less cytotoxicity in mouse 
NIH3T3 fibroblasts, with an IC50 value of 110 μM after 
48 hours of treatment with PV­10 (Figure 4A). The IC50 
value of PV­10 on B16 and 3T3 cells was similar at 6, 12, 
and 24 hours (data not shown). There was a significant 
increase in necrosis (DAPI+) of B16 cells, human 888 
melanoma cells and human primary (P1­3) melanoma 
cells after 48 hours of treatment with 50 μM of PV-10 
(Figure 4B). However, after 48 hours, a relatively small 
proportion of cells were in early apoptosis (Annexin V+ 
DAPI­, Figure 4C), with no difference after 6, 12, and 24 
hours of treatment (data not shown). This indicates that 
treatment with 50 μM of PV-10 leads to tumor cell death 
through necrosis rather than apoptosis. Little necrosis 
or apoptosis was measured in 3T3 fibroblasts or human 
embryonic kidney 293T cells in the presence of the same 
dose of PV­10 (Figure 4B and 4C). These studies suggest 
that PV­10 can kill tumor cells at a dose that is not toxic 
to non­tumor cells.
We next examined the factors that are released 
by tumor cells after treatment with PV­10. It has been 
shown that necrosis is associated with the disruption of 
the integrity of the cell membrane and the uncontrolled 
release of cytosolic contents into extracellular space, 
including DAMPs such as HMGB1, IL­1a, and HSP 
proteins. Murine B16 melanoma, human 888 melanoma 
cells and human primary melanoma cells were treated 
with 0, 100 or 200 μM PV-10 for 48 hours. The release 
of DAMPs including HMGB1, HSP70, HSP90 and IL­
1a were measured by ELISA or western blot. HSP70 and 
IL­1a were not detected and HSP90 was unchanged after 
treatment with PV­10 (data not shown). HMGB1 was 
measured in the supernatants of B16, primary melanomas, 
and 888 cells in a dose­dependent manner (Figure 5A).
To determine if secreted HMGB1 contributed to 
DC activation, BM­derived DCs were incubated for 2 
days with 20% supernatant from B16 cells treated with 
PV­10 in the presence of HMGB1 neutralizing antibody 
or isotype control antibody. Tumor supernatant from 
PV­10­treated cells led to DC maturation, with the up­
regulation of surface CD40. Neutralization of HMGB1 
in supernatants significantly decreased CD40 expression 
(Figure 5B). Treatment of DCs with PV­10 directly did not 
change CD40 expression, suggesting that PV­10 itself does 
not lead to DC maturation. Other co­stimulatory markers 
on DCs, including CD86 and CD80, were unchanged (data 
not shown).
To compare the antigen presentation capacity 
of DCs, BM­derived DCs were incubated with the 
supernatant from M05 tumor treated with IL PV­10 in 
the presence of HMGB1 neutralizing antibody or isotype 
antibody for 2 days. The pre­treated DCs were pulsed with 
OVA protein and co­cultured with OT­1 T cells. T cell

with OT­1 T cells at different ratios for 3 days. OT­1 proliferation was examined by the [3­H]­thymidine incorporation in the last 16 hours.

proliferation was measured. The blockade of HMGB1 
decreased the ability of DCs to stimulate OT­1 T cell 
proliferation (Figure 5C). This suggests that treatment 
of melanoma cells with PV­10 leads to the release of 
HMGB1, and the activation of DCs.
IL PV-10 leads to HMGB1 increase in the sera of 
melanoma patients
To determine whether HMGB1 release is relevant 
in melanoma patients treated with IL PV­10, we 
compared the level of HMGB1 in the serum of patients 
obtained before and after treatment with IL PV­10 (see 
“Materials and Methods” and Supplementary Figure S1). 
IL PV­10 led to tumor regression in both an injected and 
an uninjected bystander lesion, shown by IHC staining 
for the melanoma antigen Melan­A/MART­1 (melA) in 
the biopsy specimens (Supplementary Figure S1B­S1C). 
Notably, the concentration of HMGB1 was significantly 
increased in serum collected 7­14 days after treatment 
with IL PV­10 (Figure 6). Therefore, HMGB1 may 
contribute to the bystander effect induced by IL PV­10 in 
patients with metastatic melanoma.
The percentage of infiltrating immune cells in PV-
10 treated and bystander lesions were compared before 
and after treatment with IL PV­10. However, very few 
infiltrates were detected in the lesions that completely 
regressed, and no significant changes were measured. Thus

an alternative method was used to compare the presence 
of immune subsets in peripheral blood mononuclear 
cells (PBMCs) before and after treatment. There was 
a statistically significant increase in circulating CD8+ 
T cells, CD4+ T cells, and NKT cells after PV-10 treatment 
(Supplementary Figure S2). There was no difference in 
circulating NK cells, MDSC, CD4+FOXP3+ regulatory 
T cells or plasmacytoid DCs before and after treatment 
(data not shown).
To determine whether we could measure tumor­
specific T cell responses after PV-10 treatment, CD8+ 
T cells were purified from PBMC collected from 
7 patients before and after treatment. T cells were 
co­cultured with autologous or HLA­matched melanoma 
cell lines in vitro for 24 hours and supernatants were 
collected. A significant increase in IFN-γ production 
was measured in the CD8+ T cells isolated after 
treatment with IL PV­10 in 5 patients out of 7 patients 
that were tested. No change was measured when CD8+ 
T cells were co­cultured with HLA­mismatched cell 
lines (Supplementary Figure S3). These preliminary 
results support the role of IL PV­10 treatment to induce 
a systemic anti­tumor immune response in patients with 
metastatic melanoma.
DISCUSSION
Melanoma incidence rates have increased rapidly 
in the United States over the past 30 years and is the 
fifth most common cancer in men and the seventh 
most common cancer in women [38]. IL therapy is a 
promising treatment modality for patients with dermal 
and/or subcutaneous metastatic melanoma. Importantly, 
it may induce not only local tumor regression but also a 
systemic anti­tumor immune response. In a recent clinical 
trial in metastatic melanoma patients, IL PV­10 led to a 
50% objective response rate with mild to moderate side 
effects [17]. In treated patients, 8% had no evidence of 
disease after 52 weeks and 26% experienced complete 
regression in bystander lesions. However, the mechanism 
by which IL PV­10 leads to systemic anti­tumor immunity 
is unknown.
In this study, we showed that IL PV­10 led to the 
necrosis of melanoma cells and the release of HMGB1. 
These data are consistent with the observation that 
HMGB1 was passively released from photosensitized 
HeLa cells treated with a rose bengal analog [39]. 
Pretreatment with rose bengal acetate led to apoptosis 
and autophagy and the secretion of HSP70, HSP90 and 
HMGB1. In contrast, our results showed that PV­10 
treatment induced necrosis in melanoma cells and the 
secretion of HMGB1, but not HSP70, while the amount 
of HSP90 was unchanged. This discrepancy may be 
explained by differences in response to RB and its acetate 
analog, dose of test article, differences in the cell lines 
used, or mechanisms of ablative and photodynamic 
therapies. Moreover, HMGB1 levels in the sera of patients 
were increased after IL PV­10. This is in line with another 
study that showed increased HMGB1 levels in the serum 
of cancer patients after chemoradiation; notably, HMGB1 
levels were increased in patients with antigen-specific 
T cell responses and higher expression of HMGB1 in 
resected tumor samples was correlated with better survival 
[40].
Maturation of DCs is crucial for priming CD8+ T 
cells [41]. HMGB1 has been shown to be important for 
activation of myeloid and plasmacytoid DCs [25, 31, 42–
46]. In our model, DC maturation with up­regulation of 
CD40, CD80 and CD86 was measured in tumor draining 
LN after IL PV­10. Furthermore, our study showed that 
HMGB1 in the supernatant of tumor cells treated with 
PV­10 was responsible for the up­regulation of CD40 
expression on BM­derived DCs and for the increased 
ability of DC to stimulate T cell activation. It has been 
shown that short­term CD40 signaling augments DC 
migration to tumor­draining LNs and induced protective 
immunity. Moreover, HMGB1 has been shown to enhance 
DC responses to CCL9 and CXCL12 [47]. Interactions 
between HMGB1 and RAGE can induce the migration of 
s.c. injected DCs into DLNs [48]. In our study, IL PV­10 
increased the number of DCs migrating from the tumor 
site into the draining LNs.
In this study, we have shown a mechanism of 
tumor-specific immune response induced by IL PV-10. 
In melanoma­bearing mice, IL PV­10 induced necrosis of 
tumor cells leading to the release of HMGB1, which is 
crucial for DC activation. This resulted in DC maturation 
and infiltration into draining LNs for the activation of 
tumor-specific T cells. Additionally, increased HMGB1 
levels measured in sera of patients treated with IL PV­
10 suggests that HMGB1 may be involved in eliciting a 
systemic immune response in patients. We have shown 
that circulating T cell populations and tumor-specific 
CD8+ T cells are increased in melanoma patients after IL 
PV­10 therapy. Together these results support the design of 
additional clinical studies to measure anti­tumor immune 
responses after IL injection of PV­10 in patients with 
melanoma.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals
Female C57BL/6 mice (6–8 weeks old) were 
purchased from Harlan Laboratories. Mice were housed at 
the Animal Research Facility of the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer 
Center and Research Institute. Mice were humanely 
euthanized by CO2 inhalation according to the American 
Veterinary Medical Association Guidelines. Mice were 
observed daily and were humanely euthanized if a solitary 
subcutaneous tumor exceeded 200 mm2 in area or mice 
showed signs referable to metastatic cancer. All animal

experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal 
Care and Use Committee and performed in accordance 
with the U.S. Public Health Service policy and National 
Research Council guidelines.
Cell lines and cell culture
NIH3T3, 293T and melanoma B16 cells were 
obtained from American Type Culture Collection 
(ATCC). Human melanoma cells (526, 624 and 888) were 
obtained from the NIH. M05 tumor was generated by 
transfection of B16 melanoma with pAc­neo­OVA plasmid 
and was provided by Dr. Kenneth Rock (Dana-Farber 
Cancer Institute). M05 cells were maintained in media 
supplemented with 0.8 mg/ml G418 [36]. B16­F10­luc­G5 
cells stably expressing firefly luciferase were obtained 
from Caliper Life Sciences. All cell lines were passaged 
less than 10 times after initial revival from frozen stocks 
and tested negative for mycoplasma contamination.
Tumor supernatants and tumor digestion
PV­10 was provided by Provectus Biopharmaceuticals. 
Tumor cells were incubated with various doses of PV­10 for 
the indicated time in vitro and cell supernatant were collected. 
For generation of tumor explant supernatants (TES), when 
tumors reached 100­150 mm2, 50 ul of PBS or PV­10 were 
IL injected. After 24 hours, tumors were collected. Single­
cell suspensions were obtained by passing cells through cell 
strainers and cultured at 2 million cells per ml for 24 hours. 
TES were collected after centrifugation.
For tumor digestion, tumors were isolated from 
tumor­bearing mice treated with PV­10 or PBS and were 
digested with tumor dissociation buffer (Miltenyi Biotec) 
and GentleMACS (Miltenyi Biotec). After lysis of RBCs, 
single­cell suspensions were analyzed by FACS.
Flow cytometry, cell apoptosis assay and 
tetramer staining
Single­cell suspensions from the indicated tissues 
were prepared by pressing cells through a 70 μm cell 
strainer. After RBC lysis, cells were stained in FACS 
buffer with the following antibodies for flow cytometric 
analysis: anti­human CD3, CD4, CD8, CD25, CD11b, 
HLA-DR, CD14, FOXP3 and CD56; anti-mouse CD11c, 
I­Ab, CD45.1, CD45.2, CD8, CD4, CD3, CD86, CD80 
and CD40 (all from BD Bioscience). Cell apoptosis assays 
were performed by using Annexin V apoptosis detection 
kits (ebioscience). For tetramer staining, cells were stained 
with H-2Kb /SIINFEKL tetramer (MBL international) 
at room temperature for 20 minutes, followed by an 
additional 20 minute incubation with additional antibodies 
on ice. Live/dead fixable near-IR or aqua fluorescent 
reactive dyes (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were used to 
exclude dead cells before analysis. Cells were acquired by 
LSR II equipped with four lasers (BD Biosciences), and 
the data were analyzed with FlowJo (Tree Star).
ELISA
For detection of IFN-γ in mouse samples, splenocytes 
from PBS­ or PV­10­treated M05­bearing mice were 
expanded with 1 μg/ml SIINFEKL peptide, 20 ng/ml IL-15 
and 20 ng/ml IL­21 (R&D Systems) and then mixed with 
irradiated M05 cells at a ratio of 10:1 [49]. For detection 
of IFN-γ from human samples, CD8+ T cells were isolated 
from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with a 
human CD8+ T cell isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec). Cells 
were co­cultured with tumor cells in triplicate at a ratio of 
1:1. IFN-γ production in the supernatants was measured 
after 48 hours with an IFN-γ ELISA kit (BD bioscience). 
For detection of DAMPs in cell supernatants or in patient 
serum, an ELISA kit for HMGB1 (IBL international), IL-1α 
or HSP70 ELISA kit (both from R&D Systems) was used.
Induction of lung and subcutaneous B16 lesions
C57BL/6 mice were injected i.v. with 5e5 viable 
B16-F10-luc-G5 and s.c. in the left flank with 1e5 B16-F10 
cells. Seven days later, mice were treated by IL injection 
of the subcutaneous tumor with 50 μl PV-10 or PBS. Mice 
were treated with 100 μg of purified CD8 depleting antibody 
(2.43, BioXcell) or isotype (rat IgG2b) 2 and 3 days prior to 
PV­10 treatment and twice per week thereafter. Mice were 
shaved, intraperitoneally injected with luciferin (150 mg/
kg of body weight) and imaged with Xenogen IVIS® 200 
Image Series (PerkinElmer) on day 21.
Adoptive transfer of T cells
CD45.1+ OT-1 T cells were purified with a T cell 
enrichment column (CD3+ T cell purity >90%) (R&D 
Systems) and were incubated with CellTracer™ Violet 
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 20 min at 37°C. After two 
washes in PBS, 3e5 labeled cells were resuspended in 100 μl 
of PBS and injected i.v. into MO5 tumor­bearing mice. After 4 
days, spleens, lymph nodes (LNs) and tumors were harvested 
and stained with CD45.1, CD45.2 and CD3 antibodies. Cells 
were gated on CD45.1+CD45.2­CD3+ and cells with at least 
one division were considered “divided cells”.
Dendritic cell enrichment
M05 melanoma tumor­bearing mice were treated 
with IL PV­10 or PBS on day 7. After 18 hours, mice 
were sacrificed and tumor draining LNs were dissected 
and pooled for single cell preparation. DCs were enriched 
from pooled samples with a Pan Dendritic cell isolation 
kit (Miltenyi Biotec) and stained with antibodies against 
CD11c, MHC II, CD40, CD86 and CD80. Cells were 
analyzed on live CD11c+ MHC II+ cells.

T cell proliferation assay
Bone marrow derived DCs were purified by Opti-
prep gradient (Axis­Shield) after 5 days of BM culture with 
10 ng/ml GM­CSF and 20 ng/ml GM­CSF and 10 ng/ml 
IL­4 [50, 51]. DCs were cultured for 2 days with GM­CSF, 
IL­4 and 20% tumor supernatants (as described above). 
Next, DCs were pulsed for 2 hours with 10 μg/ml of OVA 
protein (Sigma­Aldrich). After multiple washes, DCs were 
co­cultured with 1e5 responder OT­1 T cells in triplicate, in 
U­bottom 96­well plates at different stimulator­to­responder 
ratios for 3 days. 3H-thymidine (1 μCi) was added to each 
well 18 hours prior to cell harvesting. T cell proliferation 
was measured by 3H­thymidine incorporation in a liquid 
scintillation counter Microbeta® Trilux (PerkinElmer).
HMGB-1 blockade
BM­derived DCs and 20% tumor supernatants were 
separately incubated with an antagonistic antibody against 
HMGB1 (IBL international) or the relevant isotype for 4 
hours, and then were mixed together for culture for 2 days. 
After multiple washes, DCs were pulsed with OVA protein 
and co­cultured with OT­1 T cells for T cell proliferation 
as described above.
Determination of IC50
Cells were incubated in the dark with 12.5, 25, 50, 
100, or 200 μM PV-10 or PBS in a 12-well plate for 6, 12, 
24 and 48 hours. All cells in wells were collected, mixed 
with counting beads and acquired by LSR II. DAPI was 
used to exclude dead cells before analysis. The absolute 
number of live cells was calculated by comparing the ratio 
of bead events to cell events. The half maximal inhibition 
of PV­10 on cell growth was determined as IC50 using 
GraphPad Prism.
Human subjects
Fifteen patients with dermal and/or subcutaneous 
metastatic melanoma were enrolled in a pilot study 
(NCT01760499). Peripheral blood and serum were 
collected prior to biopsy, 7­14 days after IL PV­10 
injection into a single melamona tumor, and 21­28 days 
after IL PV­10 injection. PBMCs were isolated by Ficoll–
Paque Plus (GE healthcare). Blood samples were sent 
for HLA typing to determinate HLA­matched tumor and 
HLA mismatched tumor for each patient. Serum was 
prepared by collecting the supernatant after incubation of 
blood at room temperature for 1 hour and centrifugation 
at 1,000 g. Two tumor lesions in each patient were 
sampled by biopsy pre-treatment; one of the two lesions 
was injected with IL PV­10 7 days after biopsy, then both 
residual sites were completely excised 7­14 days later. 
Biopsy specimens were fixed in formalin and embed in 
paraffin. The specimens were stained with hematoxylin 
and eosin stains for determination of pathologic complete 
response. Immunohistochemistry for melanin A (mel A) 
was performed. Flow cytometry was performed to detect 
CD3, CD4, CD8, and CD56 staining on PBMC.
Statistical analysis
The data were analyzed with a two­tailed Student 
t­test or Wilcoxon matched pairs test by GraphPad Prism. 
A p value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
