Abstract
As observed during the 2013–2016 Ebola virus disease epidemic, containment of filovirus 
outbreaks is challenging and made more difficult by the lack of approved vaccine or therapeutic 
options. Marburg and Ravn viruses are highly virulent and cause severe and frequently lethal 
disease in humans. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are a platform technology in wide use for 
autoimmune and oncology indications. Previously, we described human mAbs that can protect 
mice from lethal challenge with Marburg virus. We demonstrate that one of these mAbs, MR191-

 N, can confer a survival benefit of up to 100% to Marburg or Ravn virus–infected rhesus 
macaques when treatment is initiated up to 5 days post-inoculation. These findings extend the 
small but growing body of evidence that mAbs can impart therapeutic benefit during advanced 
stages of disease with highly virulent viruses and could be useful in epidemic settings.
INTRODUCTION
Within the Filoviridae family, Marburg marburgvirus contains two members, Marburg 
(MARV) and Ravn (RAVV) viruses. The viruses are transmitted by direct contact with 
blood, body fluids, and tissues of infected persons or animals [bats or nonhuman primates 
(NHPs)], and infection can result in high fever, headache, malaise, severe diarrhea, vomiting, 
and hemorrhagic symptoms. The mean case fatality rate of Marburg virus disease (MVD) 
outbreaks in humans since the first recognized outbreak in 1967 is about 80% (1). Concerns 
regarding natural outbreaks and weaponization of the virus (2) have made the development 
of medical countermeasures for MARV and RAVV high priorities.
Because of their high potency and specificity, as well as their clinical safety and efficacy 
record, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are an appealing platform technology for addressing 
the public health burden posed by viral infectious diseases such as MVD. With more than 45 
mAbs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines 
Agency (3), many of the manufacturing, formulation, and regulatory challenges of mAb 
drug development are well understood. The usefulness of antibodies, both naturally 
occurring and passively applied, has been evident for prevention and postexposure of viral 
infections for over a century (4, 5). However, it is only recently that evidence has 
accumulated for the efficacy of mAbs as therapeutics, even for highly virulent viral 
pathogens such as Nipah virus (6), Hendra virus (7), and Ebola virus (8, 9).
A variety of techniques have been used for therapeutic mAb discovery, including 
humanization of murine mAbs, phage display, and immunization of transgenic mice 
containing human immunoglobulin loci (10). One productive approach has been the 
isolation of human mAbs from survivors of infection (11–14), with an underlying rationale 
that naturally occurring mAbs obtained from human survivors are likely to have desirable 
safety and efficacy features based on B cell selection in vivo. We described previously a 
panel of human mAbs against the MARV glycoprotein (GP) generated from B cells of a 
survivor of MARV infection (15). All neutralizing mAbs from this panel bound to the same 
major antigenic site on the MARV GP (the receptor-binding site), and some were shown to 
cross-react with the RAVV GP. Here, down-selection of this panel of mAbs was performed 
using guinea pig models, and a lead therapeutic candidate was identified by efficacy testing 
in NHPs.
RESULTS
Pilot study in guinea pigs
Human mAbs against the MARV GP receptor-binding site have been observed to bind at 
three distinct angles of approach (15). Thus, three mAbs (MR78, MR82, and MR191), each

 representing a distinct binding angle, were selected for production in the Nicotiana 
benthamiana transient expression system (MR78-N, MR82-N, and MR191-N) (16) and 
subsequent testing in the lethal guinea pig–adapted (GPA) MARV and RAVV models (17–
19). For initial screening, guinea pigs received an intraperitoneal injection of 1000 plaque-
forming units (PFU) of GPA MARV. Two days post-inoculation (dpi), treated animals 
received a 10-mg intraperitoneal dose of mAb (or about 20 mg/kg). The dose used 
throughout these pilot studies was selected as a convenient dose consistent with dosing of 
the two mAbs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for infectious disease 
indications; palivizumab for respiratory syncytial virus is dosed at 15 mg/kg, and 
raxibacumab for anthrax is dosed at 40 mg/kg. MR82-N provided significantly less 
protection from death (P < 0.05 by Mantel-Cox test) than MR78-N or MR191-N, which 
each provided 100% protection (fig. S1A). Virus could not be detected in plasma sampled 7 
dpi in animals treated with MR78-N or MR191-N (fig. S1B), whereas virus was detected in 
the plasma of the control animal and each of the animals treated with MR82-N.
Cross-protection study in guinea pigs
To evaluate cross-protective efficacy in vivo and to further define the therapeutic window, 
we next tested MR78-N and MR191-N in GPA MARV- or RAVV-inoculated animals with a 
single 10-mg intraperitoneal dose of mAb (~20 mg/kg) 4 dpi. Sixty percent of MARV-
infected animals treated with MR78-N and 100% of animals treated with MR191-N survived 
(Fig. 1A); low levels of virus, about 1000-fold lower than controls, were detected in plasma 
7 dpi in two MR78-N–treated animals (5 × 101 and 2.2 × 102 PFU/ml) and one MR191-N–
treated animal (1 × 102 PFU/ml) (Fig. 1B). All animals had an elevated body temperature, 
and about half experienced weight loss by 4 dpi (Fig. 1, C and D), suggesting therapeutic 
rather than postexposure prophylactic efficacy by the mAbs. All GPA RAVV-inoculated 
animals treated 4 dpi with either mAb survived (Fig. 1E), with no detectable circulating 
virus 7 dpi (Fig. 1F). In contrast, both control animals succumbed by 10 dpi and had plasma 
viral loads of 1.3 × 105 or 1.4 × 105 PFU/ml.
Pilot study in NHPs
On the basis of these guinea pig data, MR191-N was selected for advancement to a MARV 
NHP pilot study. Considering that initiation of treatment 3 dpi was the latest that any drug 
candidate had been shown to protect MARV-inoculated NHPs (20), it was decided to initiate 
MR191-N dosing 4 dpi. Briefly, NHPs were inoculated with MARV and then either treated 
(n = 3) with MR191-N (50 mg/kg) intravenously 4 and 7 dpi (table S1; MARV Tx-1-3) or 
received no treatment (n = 1; table S1; MARV-1). All treated animals survived infection 
(Fig. 2A), whereas the control animal succumbed 8 dpi (P = 0.093 by Mantel-Cox test) and 
experienced severe clinical disease (Fig. 2, B and C, and table S1). Historical controls (20, 
21) with this virus stock had a MTD of 7.9 ± 0.6 dpi (n = 10; P < 0.005 compared with 
treatment group by Mantel-Cox test). On the first day of treatment 4 dpi, all NHPs were 
viremic and had an elevated body temperature (Fig. 2D; average, +0.5°C; range, +0.3° to 
0.8°C). Treatment was associated with a decline in viral load by 7 dpi with undetectable 
virus levels (limit of detection = 25 PFU/ml) by 10 dpi. In contrast, the viral load in the 
control animal increased to almost 108 PFU/ml by 8 dpi, the day the animal met clinical 
euthanasia criteria (Fig. 2B).

 Cross-protection in NHPs
To further define the therapeutic window of MR191-N, we performed a cross-protection 
study with dosing initiated 5 dpi. Groups of five animals were inoculated with an otherwise 
lethal dose of either MARV (Fig. 3) or RAVV (Fig. 4) and treated with MR191-N 
intravenously (table S1;MARVTx-4-8andRAVVTx-1-5)5and8dpi.Adoseof50mg/kg was 
chosen on the basis of dosing used in previous filovirus immunotherapy studies in NHPs (9, 
22). Eighty percent of MARV-infected (P < 0.05) and 100% of RAVV-infected (P < 0.05) 
NHPs survived, whereas the control animals succumbed on 8 dpi (MARV) or 10 dpi 
(RAVV). Compared to historical controls with the same viral stock, protection against 
MARV (P < 0.005; MTD of historical controls, 7.9 ± 0.6 dpi; n = 10) and RAVV [P < 0.01; 
MTD of historical controls (23) = 9.0 ± 1.7 dpi; n = 3] was highly significant (Figs. 3, A and 
B, and 4, A and B). On day 5, before mAb treatment, MARV-infected NHPs had viral titers 
ranging from 8.3 × 103 to 3.8 × 105 PFU/ml by plaque assay (Fig. 3C) and from 1.9 × 105 to 
8.1 × 1010 genome equivalents (GEQ)/ml by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase 
chain reaction (RT-qPCR) (Fig. 3D), as well as elevated body temperatures (average, 
+0.8°C; range, +0.2° to 1.6°C; Fig. 3E). With the exception of MARV Tx-5, all MR191-N–
treated animals had undetectable levels of circulating virus by plaque assay and RT-qPCR by 
11 dpi. MARV Tx-5 experienced a drop in viral load by both assays and then experienced a 
viral rebound detected at 14 and 15 dpi when the animal met clinical euthanasia criteria. The 
gross pathology and immunohistochemistry after necropsy observed for this animal were 
consistent with disease caused by MARV (23), whereas tissues from MR191-N–treated 
animals exhibited no evidence of disease (fig. S2). To assess whether the viral rebound was 
due to an MR191-N escape mutant, we compared the neutralization activity of MR191-N on 
virus isolated 15 dpi from MARV Tx-5 with the neutralization activity against the original 
virus used to inoculate the animals. No difference was observed, suggesting that the rebound 
was not associated with the emergence of an MR191-N escape mutant (fig. S3). In addition, 
no evidence of escape was detected by deep sequencing the viral genomic RNA 15 dpi; only 
a small population of genomes with a silent mutation in the GP gene was detected (table S2).
Before mAb treatment, all RAVV-inoculated animals had viral loads of 2 × 102 to 3 × 104 
PFU/ml by plaque assay 5 dpi (Fig. 4C) and 1 × 106 to 1.2 × 108 GEQ/ml by RT-qPCR (Fig. 
4D), and five of six NHPs had an elevated body temperature (average, +0.5°C; range, +0.1° 
to 0.8°C; Fig. 4E). Virus was not detected in MR191-N–treated animals by plaque assay 
from 8 dpi and by RT-qPCR from 11 dpi to the end of the study. The RAVV-infected control 
NHP had a peak viral load of 5.2 × 106 PFU/ml and 4 × 1010 GEQ/ml on 8 dpi, the day the 
animal met clinical euthanasia criteria. The gross pathology and immunohistochemistry after 
necropsy observed for this animal were consistent with disease caused by RAVV (23), with 
no evidence of disease in treated animals (fig. S4).
The clinical data illustrate that mAb therapy, regardless of inoculated virus, reduced 
observed clinical illness compared to controls (table S1 and Fig. 3B). Nonetheless, MR191-
N–treated NHPs had changes in hematology and blood chemistries indicative of MARV and 
RAVV infection, such as reduced lymphocyte counts and elevated liver enzymes. Unlike in 
the control animals, the clinical pathology changes resolved after MR191-N treatment 
resulted in reduced viral load, with the exception of MARV Tx-5.

 DISCUSSION
After multiple reports of an absence of benefit from antibody administration to NHPs 
infected with filoviruses (24–26), a seminal study by Dye et al. demonstrated that antibodies 
in the form of a concentrated polyclonal antibody preparation could affect survival of 
infection with EBOV or MARV in NHPs when treatment was initiated up to 2 dpi (27). 
Here, this initial finding has been extended to the use of a single recombinant mAb capable 
of protecting NHPs against both MARV and RAVV when given as late as 5 dpi. MR191 
neutralizes cell-free virus weakly, with a median inhibitory concentration of ~100 μg/ml for 
MARV (15) and >1000 μg/ml for RAVV (15). This disparity between potency in vitro and 
efficacy in vivo suggests either an artifact associated with the standard MARV and RAVV 
neutralization assays or that neutralization may only be one of the mechanisms of action by 
MR191. Most recombinant mAbs and antibodies produced in vivo are fucosylated; 
afucosylated mAbslike MR191-N have enhancedbinding to FcγRIII receptors compared to 
fucosylated mAbs, which can translate to enhanced antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity 
activity, theoretically increasing the ability of the mAb to facilitate killing of infected cells 
by the host immune system (28).
Although it is impossible to determine with certainty why MARV Tx-5 was the only 
MR191-N–treated NHP to succumb to infection, the data suggest that it was not due to 
selection of an escape mutant to the mAb. Notably, MARV Tx-5 had the highest viral load of 
any of the animals before treatment with mAb. Further, the serum concentration of MR191-
N in MARV Tx-5 was 10- to 100-fold less than that in the other NHPs 8 dpi (50 μg/ml; 
before receiving the second dose) and 2- to 6-fold less 14 dpi (70 μg/ml). These findings, 
together with the observation of high viral loads in circulation (>107 PFU/ml and >1011 
GEQ/ml) and reported in liver and spleen tissue (20) during the course of MARV infection, 
are consistent with the hypothesis that insufficient concentration of MR191-N was present in 
MARV Tx-5. The emergence and selection of escape mutant viruses during in vivo 
treatment are general concerns with mAb therapeutics, but the occurrence of these depend 
highly on the specifics of the mAb and its epitope, as well as the nature of the infectious 
agent. Cocktails of mAbs are a strategy to minimize the risk of escape mutants and are likely 
important for some indications, such as HIV immunotherapy, where the neutralizing 
epitopes have great diversity between viral clades. In other cases, one mAb may be 
sufficient; a single mAb has been shown to be an effective therapeutic in NHPs infected with 
Ebola virus (29), and the anti–respiratory syncytial virus neutralizing mAb palivizumab has 
been in widespread clinical use for over 15 years, with escape mutants having minimal 
clinical relevance (30). No evidence of escape mutants was detected in the single NHP 
(MARV Tx-5) that succumbed to infection; the conservation of the MR191 epitope among 
both members of M. marburgvirus suggests that it may be critical for viral fitness.
The work presented here has several limitations. The number of neutralizing human mAbs 
available for evaluation was limited, and, from that small number, resource constraints only 
allowed testing of three mAbs in vivo. Further studies may identify superior mAbs or 
combinations of mAbs. Measurement of viral load by plaque assay in these studies may be 
confounded by the presence of the neutralizing mAb in blood, which highlights the 
importance of testing by the orthogonal RT-qPCR method. Finally, pharmacology and

 toxicology testing, as well as manufacturing under Good Manufacturing Practices, will be 
required before MR191 can be tested clinically.
The 2013–2016 Ebola virus disease epidemic highlighted the troubling absence of 
prophylactic or therapeutic options for filoviruses. Without a clinically acceptable treatment, 
little incentive exists for infected individuals to report to a treatment unit. This dynamic 
makes it difficult to track and contain outbreaks because infected individuals continue to 
expose family and community members to the risk of transmission. Recently, promising 
results in the MARV NHP model with potential medical countermeasures have been 
reported, including 100% protection of MARV-infected NHPs treated with seven daily doses 
of lipid-encapsulated small interfering RNA (siRNA) starting up to 3 dpi (20). Additionally, 
daily dosing for 14 days with an antisense phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer (PMO) 
starting 4 dpi provided 83 to 100% protection to NHPs infected with MARV-Musoke, a 
putatively less virulent MARV isolate (1, 31). The results reported here represent a 
significant advance in that a single drug candidate, MR191-N, provided therapeutic benefit 
against both MARV and RAVV with only two doses initiated 5 dpi. The observation that all 
treated animals were viremic before dosing suggests that this time frame is a clinically 
realistic treatment window. Although siRNAs and PMOs are both promising new classes of 
experimental molecules, the safety of mAb therapy in humans is well documented, 
particularly for mAbs against nonself antigens. mAbs offer the ability to confer immediate 
and specific immunity in all populations, including the young, the elderly, and the 
immunocompromised. The evidence presented here suggests that MR191 is an effective pan-
marburgvirus mAb and one of the most promising approaches in development for treating 
disease caused by MARV and RAVV.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
Guinea pigs were used to screen candidate MARV mAbs before assessment in NHPs (n = 5 
guinea pigs per treatment group). A lead candidate mAb (MR191-N) was selected from the 
guinea pig studies for further evaluation in NHPs. Sixteen healthy adult rhesus macaques 
(Macaca mulatta) of Chinese origin (4 to 7 kg) were used to conduct three separate studies 
to test the therapeutic efficacy of MR191-N. The experimental design included an initial 
study of three treated animals and one control animal to assess the efficacy against MARV 
when treatment was initiated 4 days after exposure. The two subsequent studies assessed the 
efficacy of MR191-N using groups of n = 5 treated animals and n = 1 control animal when 
treatment was initiated beginning 5 days after either MARV or RAVV virus exposure. 
Historical controls were used to supplement treatment groups. Animals were randomized 
with Microsoft Excel into treatment or control groups. A number of parameters were 
monitored during the course of the study, including survival, clinical observations, 
hematology, serum biochemistry, viremia and viral load in tissues by RT-qPCR and plaque 
assay, and tissue pathology. The primary objective of the study was to assess survival rates, 
with all other measurements being considered secondary objectives. This study was not 
blinded. Primary data are included in table S3.

 mAb production
mAbs [MR78 and MR82, human immunoglobulin G1 κ (IgG1κ); MR191, human IgG1λ] 
(15) used in guinea pig studies were produced in tobacco (N. benthamiana) at Mapp 
Biopharmaceutical Inc., as described previously (32). mAbs used in NHP experiments were 
manufactured in N. benthamiana by Kentucky BioProcessing, as described previously (8, 
22). Consistent with previous findings (33–35), the mAb was >99% afucosylated, with 
GnGn being the predominant N-glycoform, and significant differences were not observed 
between the lots produced at the two sites.
Ethics statement
Both the guinea pig and NHP research were conducted in compliance with the Animal 
Welfare Act and other federal statutes and regulations relating to animals and experiments 
involving animals and adhered to principles stated in the eighth edition of the Guide for the 
Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (National Research Council, 2011). The facility where 
this research was conducted [University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB)] is fully 
accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care 
International and has an approved Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare Assurance 
(#A3314-01). Conducting animal studies in biosafety level 4 (BSL-4) restricts the number of 
animal subjects, the volume of biological samples that can be obtained, and the ability to 
repeat assays independently and thus limits statistical analysis. Consequently, data are 
presented as means calculated from replicate samples, not replicate assays, and error bars 
represent SD across replicates.
Guinea pig studies
MARV mAbs were down-selected for use in NHPs using female outbred Hartley strain 
guinea pigs (~350 to 400 g; Charles River Laboratories) that were inoculated with about 
1000 PFU of GPA MARV (Angola isolate) or GPA RAVV by intraperitoneal injection (18). 
Three MARV mAbs (MR82-N, MR78-N, and MR191-N) (15) were tested therapeutically 
using a 10-mg intraperitoneal dose of individual mAb at 2 dpi (n = 5 per antibody treatment) 
against GPA MARV inoculation, and two MARV mAbs, MR78-N and MR191-N, were 
tested at 4 dpi (n = 5 per antibody per virus) against GPA MARV or GPA RAVV 
inoculation. Animals were bled 7 dpi and observed for signs of disease, weight loss, 
temperature, and survival up to 28 dpi.
NHP studies
Sixteen healthy rhesus macaques (M. mulatta) of Chinese origin (4 to 7 kg) were used to 
evaluate MARV mAb MR191-N (50 mg/kg per dose) in three separate studies. In two 
studies, animals were inoculated by the intramuscular route with a target dose of 1000-PFU 
MARV Angola isolate Marburg virus H.sapiens-tc/ANG/2005/Angola {passage 2; Vero E6 
[American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), CRL-1586]} and were treated either at 4 and 7 
dpi (control, n = 1; treated, n = 3) or at 5 and 8 dpi (control, n = 1; treated, n = 5); actual 
inoculum has 1050 PFU for 4 or 7 dpi and 1240 PFU for 5 or 8 dpi studies. In a separate 
study, NHPs were inoculated with RAVV Ravn virus H.sapiens-tc/KEN/1987/Kitum 
Cave-810040 (passage 3; Vero E6), 1000-PFU intramuscular target dose (actual dose, 1100

 PFU), and were treated at 5 and 8 dpi (control, n = 1; treated, n = 5). All animals were given 
physical exams, and blood was collected at the time of inoculation and on 4 or 5, 7 or 8, 10 
or 11, 14, 21, and 28 dpi. In addition, all animals were monitored daily and scored for 
disease progression with an internal filovirus scoring protocol approved by the UTMB 
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. The scoring changes were measured from 
baseline for posture/activity level, attitude/behavior, food consumption (only the absence of 
food consumption is scored; incomplete consumption is noted as captured in table S1) and 
water intake, weight, respiration, and disease manifestations such as visible rash, 
hemorrhage, ecchymosis, or flushed skin. A set score of greater than 9 from combined signs 
was used to determine criteria for euthanasia.
MARV and RAVV seed stocks were deep-sequenced and compared to prototype isolates 
(GenBank #DQ447653 and #DQ447649) as described below. The challenge stocks were 
also tested for endotoxin in the preparations using the Endosafe–Portable Test System (PTS) 
(Charles River Laboratories). Virus preparations were diluted 1:10 in limulus amebocyte 
lysate (LAL) reagent water according to the manufacturer’s directions, and endotoxin levels 
were tested in LAL Endosafe-PTS cartridges as directed by the manufacturer; each result 
was below the limit of detection, whereas positive controls showed that the tests were valid. 
Challenge stocks were also tested for mycoplasma contamination using the e-Myco PLUS 
Mycoplasma Detection Kit (Boca Scientific), and the results were found to be below the 
limit of detection.
Detection of viremia by plaque assay
Virus titration was performed on Vero E6 (ATCC, CRL-1586) cell monolayer cultures using 
a plaque assay, as previously described (36). Briefly, increasing 10-fold dilutions of the 
samples were adsorbed to Vero E6 monolayers in duplicate wells (200 μl), and, after 7 to 9 
days, neutral red staining was used to visualize plaques; the limit of detection was 25 
PFU/ml.
Detection of viremia by RT-qPCR
RNA was isolated from whole blood using Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen) with 100 μl of 
blood into 600 μl of buffer AVL. Primers/probe targeting the nucleoprotein gene of MARV 
were used for RT-qPCR, with the probe used here being 6-carboxyfluorescein–5′-
CCCATAAGGTCACCCTCTT-3′-6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine (Life Technologies) (18). 
MARV RNA was detected using the CFX96 detection system (Bio-Rad Laboratories) in 
One-Step Probe RT-PCR kits (Qiagen) with the following cycle conditions: 50°C for 10 min, 
95°C for 10 s, and 40 cycles of 95°C for 10 s and 59°C for 30 s. Threshold cycle values 
representing MARV genomes were analyzed with CFX Manager Software, and data are 
shown as number of GEQ per milliliter. To create the GEQ standard, RNA from MARV 
stocks was extracted, and the number of MARV genomes was calculated using Avogadro’s 
number and the molecular weight of the MARV genome.

 mean corpuscular volumes, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentrations were analyzed 
from blood collected in tubes containing EDTA using a laser-based hematologic analyzer 
(Beckman Coulter). Serum samples were tested for concentrations of albumin, amylase, 
alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, γ-
glutamyltransferase, glucose, cholesterol, total protein, total bilirubin, blood urea nitrogen, 
creatinine, and C-reactive protein by using a Piccolo point-of-care analyzer and 
BioChemistry Panel Plus analyzer discs (Abaxis).
Histopathology and immunohistochemistry
Necropsy was performed on all subjects. Tissue samples of all major organs were collected 
for histopathologic and immunohistochemical (IHC) examination, immersion-fixed in 10% 
neutral buffered formalin, and processed for histopathology, as previously described (20). 
For IHC examination, specific anti-MARV VP40 protein rabbit primary antibody (Integrated 
BioTherapeutics) was used to detect MARV antigen. The secondary antibody used was 
biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Vector Laboratories), and LSAB2 streptavidin–horseradish 
peroxidase (Dako) was used to visualize antigen. Tissue sections were processed using the 
Dako Autostainer. Slides were developed with Dako diaminobenzidine chromogen and 
counterstained with hematoxylin. Non-immune rabbit IgG primary antibody was used as a 
negative control.
MR191-N neutralization analysis for the presence of potential virus escape mutant
Briefly, Vero E6 cells were seeded into six-well plates to generate a confluent monolayer on 
the day of inoculation. Neutralization assays were performed with serial dilutions of 
MR191-N prepared in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium and incubated with ~100 PFU 
of MARV in a total volume of 200 μl at 37°C for 60 min; controls with no mAb were 
included (102 ± 8 PFU; n = 6). Medium was removed from cells, the mAb-virus mixture 
was added to duplicate wells, and plates were incubated for 60 min at 37°C. The mixture 
was removed from the cells, and 2 ml of 0.9% agarose in Eagle’s minimum essential 
medium with 5% fetal bovine serum was overlaid onto each of the wells. Cells were 
observed 5 to 7 dpi, and plaques were visualized and counted using neutral red stain.
Deep sequencing analysis of RNA genome of MARV seed stock and NHP isolate
To analyze the potential for MR191-N escape mutants, virus was isolated (Passage 1; Vero 
E6) from the 15-dpi sample of MARV Tx-5 and the original stock of MARV-Angola. 
Briefly, viral RNA was isolated from a TRIzol LS (Invitrogen)/sample mixture using a 
Direct-zol RNA MiniPrep (Zymo Research) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 
About 150 ng of purified RNA was used to make complementary DNA using the Ovation 
RNA-Seq 2.0 kit (NuGEN), and this, in turn, was used for the preparation of the double-
stranded DNA library, using the Encore Ion Torrent library prep kit. Sequencing was 
performed by the UTMB Molecular Core on the Ion Torrent using 318-v2 deep sequencing 
chips. Sequence analysis was performed using SeqMan NGen software (DNASTAR) on the 
basis of unpaired analysis of 125–base pair overlaps.
