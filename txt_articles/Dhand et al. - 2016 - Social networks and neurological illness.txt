Abstract
Every patient is embedded in a social network of interpersonal connections that influence health 
outcomes. Neurologists routinely need to engage with a patient’s family and friends due to the 
nature of the illness and its social sequelae. Social isolation is a potent determinant of poor health 
and neurobiological changes, and its effects can be comparable to those of traditional risk factors. 
It would seem reasonable, therefore, to map and follow the personal networks of neurology 
patients. This approach reveals influential people, their habits, and linkage patterns that could 
facilitate or limit health behaviours. Personal network information can be particularly valuable to 
enhance risk factor management, medication adherence, and functional recovery. Here, we 
propose an agenda for research and clinical practice that includes mapping the networks of 
patients with diverse neurological disorders, evaluating the impact of the networks on patient 
outcomes, and testing network interventions.

 however, reveals that this is an inaccurate model, as every patient is embedded in a complex 
and diverse social system. A physician’s interaction with this social network is routine, 
implicit, and necessary. In neurology, an appreciation of patients’ social networks is 
especially important, as the nature of the injury or illness requires engagement with families 
and friends, sometimes to the exclusion of the patient. Systematic study of the social 
system’s constitution and natural evolution after disease, and its engagement for therapeutic 
purposes, is an important unmet need, particularly for neurological disorders.
Robust epidemiological studies conducted over three decades have shown that social 
structures influence health2–4. Social isolation and the perception of isolation, known 
commonly as loneliness, is as potent a determinant of poor health as smoking, elevated 
blood pressure, high cholesterol, and physical inactivity5–8. In cerebrovascular disease, 
social isolation has been linked to an increased risk of incident stroke9,10, and to poorer 
outcomes after stroke11–13. Conversely, an extensive social network is protective against 
dementia14,15, possibly by mitigating the effects of pathology on cognitive function16. In 
current practice, however, the social life of a patient is barely screened and rarely 
commented on in a neurologist’s final recommendations to the patient.
The interplay between social life and brain anatomy, physiology and biology is important. 
Neocortical volume co-varies with social group sizes in nonhuman primates and, possibly, 
humans17. This pattern suggests that social life is a primary evolutionary driver of 
neocortical enlargement across species17–20. Language itself might have evolved as a vehicle 
to facilitate social demands17. Pathologically, the socially isolated brain has been shown to 
have higher baseline vascular resistance, lower inflammatory control, and decreased 
neurogenesis after injury21–23. These effects of social isolation on the brain are accompanied 
by a host of systemic physiological changes, including an elevated stress response, 
inflammation, and hypertension24.
This article lays out a framework for understanding the local social structure around a 
patient. It explains the concepts and terms used in network research, outlines methods to 
elicit and analyse data, and proposes an agenda for research and clinical applications of 
network science.
Personal networks
Personal networks, also called egocentric networks, describe the relations of a set of 
individuals — the alters — around a focal individual — an ego. In accordance with the 
principles of graph theory, all individuals in the network are nodes, and their relations, which 
can be defined by emotional closeness, contact frequency or physical distance, are the ties 
that link the nodes (FIG. 1). Personal networks differ from whole networks, also known as 
sociocentric networks, which focus on patterns of relationships in a bounded group without 
a prespecified central node25. Personal networks are also distinct from social support 
studies, which focus on the quality and absolute number of a person’s social ties. By 
contrast, personal networks concentrate on a fuller view of the structure of the network, its 
components, and the types of ties26.

 Personal networks operationalize the social context into quantitative variables, thereby 
enabling evaluation of the social capital available to the individual in the form of social 
resources, cohesion, and brokering opportunities27,28. Examples of personal networks 
include individuals consulted when a person seeks a new job, or the social circle around a 
new immigrant. Research shows that the characteristics of alters and their relationships with 
each other influence the ego’s behaviour, performance, and adaptation to life events27. For 
example, perhaps counter-intuitively, an ego with weaker ties to alters who are strangers to 
one another is more likely to get a job, probably because unconnected alters provide novel 
information and contact to useful parties outside the ego’s typical social circle29. Similarly, 
individuals who assimilate into society after immigration have a tendency to maintain 
friendship groups of varying demographics earlier in life30. Delineation of the characteristics 
of such networks, in terms of face-to-face interaction versus contact mediated through 
technology and social media, is an active area of research20.
In terms of health, connected individuals often display interdependent well-being, which has 
been attributed to a variety of mechanisms31 (FIG. 2). This principle is best demonstrated in 
the context of marriage, where the illness and death of a spouse can shorten the lifespan of a 
caregiving partner — the so-called bereavement effect32. The illness and, ultimately, death 
of the spouse is thought to impose stress and deprive the caregiver of a supportive tie33 The 
bereavement effect is particularly pronounced when the spouse has a condition such as 
stroke, dementia or critical illness that can compromise physical or mental abilities. 
Caregiving partners in this scenario have among the highest hazard ratios for depression and 
mortality32,34. For the patient, having more friends beyond the caregiver is associated with 
health improvements and, complementarily, healthiness is associated with closer 
relationships among all people in the network35. As mentioned earlier, a deficient personal 
network for the patient portends poorer recovery from stroke, worse trajectories after 
dementia, and a higher risk of mortality and morbidity in general9–16. Therefore, personal 
network mapping could identify at-risk patients and caregivers, while also providing a 
means for potential intervention.
A survey is the standard instrument for the generation of data regarding personal networks, 
although derivation of nodes and ties from existing phone, email or Internet sources is also 
possible36. Typically, the survey has three components: name generator, name inter-relater, 
and name interpreter (TABLE 1). The name generator is a set of questions designed to 
identify the nodes in the network. The example questions listed in TABLE 1 are adapted 
from validated questions that are used in the General Social Survey, a population-based 
sociological survey conducted annually in the USA37. For sample sizes of up to 250, we 
recommend not capping the total number of individuals named. By following this protocol, 
researchers can avoid a ceiling effect in data gathering. The name inter-relater questions aim 
to elicit the tie pattern and strength among the named individuals. These are the critical data 
that distinguish network structure studies from social support surveys, which typically stop 
at the quantity and quality of relationships rather than the structure26,27. Finally, name 
interpreter questions generate data on the individual characteristics of each alter. Here, 
questions about health behaviour are asked with a view to understanding the local health 
environment and possible social influences acting on the ego. To avoid survey fatigue in

 patients, we only collect name inter-relater and name interpreter data for the first ten 
individuals named by the ego.
Analysis of personal networks
The analysis of personal networks is divided into composition analysis, which examines the 
range of characteristics of people around the patient, and structure analysis, which examines 
the organization of ties and their patterns in graph theoretical terms.
For composition analysis, consider two people who have experienced a stroke (FIG. 3). They 
are of similar age and stroke severity — the two strongest predictors of functional 
outcome38. However, the make-up of their social networks differs. Patient 1 (FIG. 3a) has a 
network composed totally of kin who are the same race and differing gender, and have 
similar non-healthy behaviours. Patient 2 (FIG. 3b) has a network composed of a mixture of 
kin and non-kin who are the same gender and race, and have similar healthy behaviours. An 
open question is whether these two patients will have different outcomes at 6 months that 
might be partly explained by the differences in their networks. Measures of composition 
include the standard deviation of the alters’ ages, the proportion of kin, the diversity of 
gender index, the diversity of race index, and the proportions of individuals who engage in 
healthy and unhealthy behaviours. In these measures, the amount of variation — or 
heterogeneity — in the variables is important to understand the range of diversity around the 
patient39.
The structural analysis of personal networks involves graph theoretical measurements. The 
researcher usually begins by measuring network size, which is the total number of nodes 
excluding the ego. The second step is to calculate network density. The density of personal 
networks is the extent to which alters are connected, and is calculated as the sum of ties 
divided by all possible ties excluding the ego:
where L is the number of observed ties, and N is the number of nodes40.
Certain network structural motifs offer constraints as well as opportunities for the ego. Both 
of these possibilities can be addressed by conducting a series of measurements under the 
theory of structural holes41. A structural hole is the absence of a connection between two 
alters. Although the hole can seem to be a weakness, it empirically affords an advantage to 
the ego, who is provided with an opportunity to connect or bridge the gap between the two 
parties. Bridging affords advantages such as diversity of information, non-overlapping 
resources and knowledge, and the opportunity to broker between the strangers42. In terms of 
health, bridging has been associated with increased wellness and longer life43. However, it 
also creates cognitive demands that might not be sustainable during illness43.
To measure structural holes and bridging, constraint and effective size can be calculated. 
Constraint is a measure of the extent to which the ego’s alters have ties to each other. It is

 highest in a close-knit network of individuals who are familiar to each other, such as in a 
nuclear family. Mathematically, it is the sum of direct and indirect paths from the ego to 
every alter:
where i is the ego, q and j are alters, pij is the proportional strength of i’s relationship with j, 
piq is the proportional strength of i’s relationship with q, and pqj is the proportional strength 
of q’s relationship with j (REF. 44). In this calculation, ties can be weighted to account for 
strong and weak relationships as evaluated by the patient. In such cases, we set strong ties as 
2, weak ties as 1, and no tie as 0 (REF. 44).
Effective size is the inverse of constraint and denotes the number of nonredundant nodes in 
the network:
where i is the ego, q and j are alters, and
measures the portion of i’s relationship with j that is redundant to i’s relationships with other 
primary contacts44. High effective size, which is usually accompanied by low constraint, 
indicates a network of unconnected individuals that has structural holes. Examples include 
networks centred on individuals who have located a new job quickly, or individuals engaged 
with groups in varying places such as work, church and school.
FIG. 4 shows the same patients presented in FIG. 3, but with tie information included. Both 
have relatively small networks. However, Patient 1’s (FIG. 4a) network is full of strong ties, 
creating a dense network with high constraint and low effective size, whereas Patient 2’s 
(FIG. 4b) network has more weak ties and individuals unknown to each other, resulting in a 
less dense network with lower constraint and higher effective size. This latter network 
structure might afford Patient 2 with opportunities to access differing social resources, 
engage in various social contexts, and receive novel advice.
The analysis of personal networks is facilitated by computer software in statistical packages 
such as R, UCINET, Pajek, and E-Net (REF. 25). Important additional study includes 
qualitative and longitudinal analyses, which allow investigation of mechanisms and 
explanations for the patterns observed. Posing open-ended questions to the patient about his 
or her relationships and their evolution during illness often elicits rich information. These 
types of questions can inform mechanistic hypotheses about social influence, access to

 resources and goods, and social support. For example, friendship ties for young adults might 
be a source of multidimensional support or no support at all. To fully elucidate the meaning 
of ties, and to understand the consequences of their changes on an ego, qualitative data are 
needed45. Furthermore, structural assessments over time reveal important information on 
network dynamics and adaptation to disease states46. For instance, research in older adults 
suggests that individuals who gain confidants over time report better functional and 
psychological health, whereas loss of network ties is associated with functional — but not 
psychological — decline47. In the context of neurological illness, assessing the development 
of a patient’s personal network over time can provide insight into which patients are at risk 
of poor health outcomes. One such example from the clinic is presented in BOX 1 and 
Supplementary information S1 (video), which depict the evolving social network of a patient 
with stroke, from onset to 6 months.

Network dynamics during stroke recovery
A 48-year-old married woman, who worked as a chef, had a brainstem stroke with 
moderate deficits (NIH Stroke Scale score = 5). Her personal network at the time of 
stroke is shown in panel a, and included four individuals, most of whom knew each other. 
Three of the four were family members. At 3 months (panel b), her network had shrunk 
to two family members. She scored poorly on patient-reported recovery outcomes, and 
showed increased levels of depression. At 6 months (panel c), her network had increased 
to six individuals, including three reacquainted friends. Her patient-reported recovery 
outcomes improved. She reported purposely seeking new friends to avoid being “stuck at 
home.” She and Vicky also simultaneously gave up smoking. Supplementary information 
S1 (video) shows the evolution of the network dynamics over time. Written consent for 
publication was obtained from the patient described in this case report.

 Applications in neurology
Core issues of medical care, including but not limited to risk factor management, medication 
adherence, health education, and physical and cognitive rehabilitation, involve social 
networks. Engagement — or, at least, awareness — of the behaviours of key members in a 
network enhances counselling conversations about everyday activities such as diet, smoking 
habits, and exercise.
To advance network science in neurology, at least four research priorities need to be 
addressed. The first step is to establish baseline network characteristics and their 
longitudinal changes in patients with common neurological disorders such as stroke, 
headache, seizure disorders, dementia, or movement disorders. This step requires 
establishment of a set of network instruments that are applicable to neurological patients. 
The second step is to determine which aspects of network structure and composition are 
associated with neurological outcomes. Outcomes can be in the form of patient-reported 
measures, such as the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System 
(PROMIS), and traditional functional outcome measures, such as the modified Rankin Scale. 
The third step is to identify the most important social and biological mechanisms through 
which social networks act. These mechanisms could include social influence, information 
spread, social support, and neurophysiological, neuroanatomical and inflammatory changes. 
The fourth and final step is to test promising network interventions against usual care in 
prospective and randomized studies.

 An example of social network research in neurology is our work on the impact of patients’ 
social networks on timing of hospital arrival after acute ischaemic stroke48. We examined 
the personal social networks of fast (<6 h) and slow (>6 h) responders, building on prior 
literature which showed that being unmarried and living alone were risk factors for 
delay49,50. Our preliminary analysis revealed that patients who arrived later had close-knit 
networks, that is, smaller networks with higher constraint. The underlying mechanisms 
included over-reliance on strong ties, such as those between family members, who might 
downplay symptoms, and lack of contact with weak ties, for example, a friend who is a 
nurse, who can advise on the appropriate course of action. The finding is consistent with 
extensive literature on the strength of weak ties29. Further work in this area could lead to 
stroke education that is tailored to patients’ personal network characteristics.
One of ultimate goals for network science in neurology is to build and deploy evidence-
based network interventions for neurological patients in clinical settings. A network 
intervention is the use of social network data to accelerate behavioural change51. Though not 
deliberately monitoring personal networks, Alcoholics Anonymous is one example of an 
intervention that changes personal networks by adding nodes and rewiring existing ties52. 
Also in the addiction context, ‘network therapy’ is a form of cognitive behavioural therapy 
that aims to employ the core network of family members and friends to support adherence to 
treatment53. Such strategies have been shown to improve the effectiveness of maintenance 
therapy for heroin addiction54. The Treatment and Prevention Study (TAPS) is a promising 
randomized controlled trial currently recruiting intravenous drug users. It tests the 
effectiveness of a ‘bring your friends’ personal network approach to reduce the incidence of 
hepatitis C infection55,56. Prior studies show that treating all members of the personal 
network is the most effective way to clear a communicable infection in the population. The 
personal network approach outperformed selective targeting of nodes with the most ties56.
In the neurology office, we hope that the promising data presented by network studies will 
compel clinicians to incorporate a network lens when recording the social history of a 
patient. By reimagining the patient as a social being embedded in an interpersonal web of 
relations that constrain and facilitate health-related behaviours, we can obtain valuable 
information. For example, by asking the ego a set of questions aimed at unravelling 
relationships in the network, we might identify patients who are at risk of poor outcomes. 
Questions could include: who do you discuss important matters with? Who do you socialize 
with regularly? Who supports you on a regular basis? Are these individuals as close to each 
other as they are to you? Patients who are at risk are typically surrounded by a small number 
of close-knit alters. Identifying at-risk individuals is the first step to implementing an 
effective behavioural change intervention.
Once patients with at-risk networks are identified, therapeutic network interventions can be 
tried. Initial strategies include recruitment of driver nodes, that is, individuals who hold 
particular sway regarding dietary and lifestyle behaviours in the network. Such an individual 
might not be the spouse, but, rather, a close friend or family member who holds a 
structurally pivotal position. Influential people in a network can be recruited to champion 
important and difficult behavioural changes. Secondly, network components that are, for 
example, tightly bound clusters in the networks can be targeted for team interventions, such

 as full-group smoking cessation or exercise programmes. Additionally, social expansion — a 
deliberate attempt to increase personal network size — can be tried for patients with small 
networks. Increasing the size of an individual’s personal network can extend the typical 
support group model and improve patient outcomes in both psychosocial domains — such as 
the severity of depression — and biological domains — such as the level of hypertension or 
the degree of inflammation.
Limitations of network models
As a middle-level theory, personal network approaches have limitations in both the 
individual and broader social–historical dimensions57. By definition, the network 
perspective reduces the emphasis on individual agency, defined as the view that an 
individual decides and acts independently regardless of context. Social networks are also an 
insufficient model for broader social and historical forces, such as poverty or racism. To 
address such factors, a combination of quantitative (epidemiological) and qualitative 
(ethnographic) analysis at the community and population level is needed. Networks also 
privilege human actors over technologies, animals and inanimate objects that can also have 
an impact on health. Realistically, some of these forces are beyond the purview and 
influence of an individual neurologist, and are probably more relevant to psychological, 
public health and policy strategies. Finally, more research is needed on the creation and 
execution of network interventions in clinical populations. Due to these blind spots in 
personal network approaches, we advise that a network lens should be used in combination 
with traditional clinical and epidemiological approaches.
Conclusions
Rethinking the patient as a person embedded in a social web is important in neurological 
contexts. Social networks influence health, they can be mapped in research and clinical 
contexts, and they can be utilized for therapeutic purposes. The network approach shows 
promise to improve understanding of health behaviours and create sustainable change in 
patients’ lives. Future research to foster this vision includes robust measurement of networks 
in neurological patients, association of networks to patient outcomes, establishing the role of 
social mechanisms in disease and recovery, and building evidence-based network 
interventions.

 Figure 1. The personal network of a patient
The ego (that is, the patient) is connected to members of his personal network, known as 
alters, by either a strong or a weak tie. In this figure, the personal network of the patient 
includes subgroups of family members, friends and a co-worker. By evaluating the 
architecture and composition of relationships among network members, neurologists might 
be able to identify patients who are at risk of poor outcomes.

 Figure 2. Social network mechanisms that influence health behaviour
Networks affect behaviour through at least five pathways; person to person contact, social 
engagement, social influence, access to resources and material goods, and social support31. 
Social support comes in four forms; instrumental and financial support, informational 
support, appraisal support and emotional support. Appraisal support relates to how an alter 
can provide an ego with appropriate feedback or help with decision making. The influence 
of a pathway on the ego–alter relationship can change over time. Some ties operate through 
several pathways, while others are more specialized. The ego is the patient at the centre of 
the network, an alter is an individual in a network, and a tie is the connection between 
individuals in a network.

 Figure 3. Personal network composition for two patients with stroke
The composition of a network includes information about alters and their habits, such as diet 
and the frequency of exercise. a | Patient 1 has a kin-based network with pervasive unhealthy 
habits. b | Patient 2’s network is mixed with kin and non-kin who are the same gender and 
race with healthy habits.

 Figure 4. Personal network structure for two patients with stroke
The structure of a network is the organization of ties and their patterns in quantitative terms. 
Patients who are at risk of poor outcomes are typically surrounded by a small number of 
close-knit alters. a | Patient 1 has a high-constraint network in which all members are closely 
knit together. b | Patient 2 has a low-constraint network that includes unconnected 
individuals and structural holes.

Social network survey sections and questions35,37
Survey section
Example questions
Name generator
1. From time to time, most people discuss important personal matters with other people. Looking back over the past 3 
months, who are the adults with whom you discussed an important personal matter?
2. From time to time, people socialize with other people. For instance, they visit each other, go together on a trip or to 
dinner. In the past 3 months, who are the adults with whom you usually do these things?
3. In the past 3 months, who supported you most often?
Name inter-relater
1. Compared with the others you mentioned, do you feel especially close to[Name 1]?
2. I will now focus on the relationships between each pair of people you mentioned. For example, I will ask about [Name 
1] and [Name 2]. For each pair, I will ask whether they are total strangers, especially close, or in between. By total 
strangers, I mean that they wouldn’t recognize one another if they met on the street. By especially close, I mean as close to 
each other as they are to you. By in between, I mean all other relationships. Is [Name 1] a total stranger, especially close, 
or in between with [Name 2]? (Repeat for each name pairing)
Name interpreter
1. Is [Name 1] a man or woman?
2. Does [Name 1] have a negative influence on your health? For example does he or she passively or actively encourage 
you to smoke, not eat well, or not exercise?
3. How is [Name 1] connected to you? Options include spouse, parent, sibling, child, other family, co-worker, co-member 
in organization, neighbour, friend, advisor, or other. You can choose more than one.
4. Has [Name 1] done any of the following to try and improve his or her health in the past 3 months?
•
Cut back on smoking?
•
Exercised at least three times per week?
•
Regularly taken his or her medications, meaning missed them less than once per week?
•
Attended all doctor’s appointments?
