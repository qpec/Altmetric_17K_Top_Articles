Background: Concerns about ethical conflicts, moral distress, and burnout in veterinary practice
are steadily increasing. Root causes of these problems have not been rigorously identified. Little
research has been done to evaluate the existence of moral distress in North American veterinar-
ians or to explore its impact on career sustainability and poor well-being.
Hypothesis/Objectives: Ethical conflict and resultant moral distress are common occurrences
in contemporary veterinary practice and negatively impact daily practice life, but may not be
identified or labeled by veterinarians as such.
Animals: No animals were used in this study.
Methods: Mixed methods sequential explanatory design; confidential and anonymous on-line
sampling of 889 veterinarians in North America.
Results: A majority of respondents reported feeling conflict over what care is appropriate to
provide. Over 70% of respondents felt that the obstacles they faced that prevented them from
providing appropriate care caused them or their staff moderate to severe distress. Seventy-nine
percent of participants report being asked to provide care that they consider futile. More than
70% of participants reported no training in conflict resolution or self-care.
Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Veterinarians report widespread ethical conflict and moral
distress across many practice types and demographics. Most veterinarians have little to no train-
ing on how to decrease the impact of these problems. Ethical conflict and resulting moral dis-
tress may be an important source of stress and poor well-being that is not widely recognized or
well defined. Well-researched and effective tools used to decrease moral distress in human
healthcare could be adapted to ameliorate this problem.
KEYWORDS
burnout: professional, negotiating, self-care, mental health, morals, surveys and
questionnaires, medical futility, suicidal ideation, compassion fatigue, dissent and disputes,
stress: psychological, morals, suicide, ethical theory, ethical dilemma, empathy

INTRODUCTION
The practice of veterinary medicine has a complex ethical structure
that consists of professional obligations to the animal patient, the
animal owner, other veterinary professionals and society at large.1
Ethical dilemmas, or situations where the right course of action is not
clear, occur when these obligations conflict either with one another,
with the veterinarians' own moral standards, or both.2 These types of
conflicts are ethical in nature and can cause moral distress. Because of
this complex ethical structure, veterinarians may consider moral dis-
tress an unavoidable part of veterinary practice. Although some small
scale studies have documented ethical conflict in veterinary medicine,
much of this work has been done outside of North America.3–5 Even
less has been written about how veterinarians feel about and cope
with these kinds of situations.
Moral distress as it pertains to healthcare professionals has been
discussed for over 30 years.6,7 Andrew Jameton originally defined
moral distress among nurses in 1984 as “the experience of knowing

 the right thing to do while being in a situation in which it is nearly
impossible to do it.”6 In contrast to the existing literature of the time,
Jameton focused on the psychological impact of painful feelings, psy-
chological disequilibrium, or both resulting from barriers to performing
actions consistent with one's own moral compass.7 This distinguishes
moral distress from other kinds of distress encountered in professional
work. Since that time, a large body of research and literature has
expanded the definition and application of the concept of moral dis-
tress in professional life far beyond the original application.6,8–10
Although disagreement exists about the ethical underpinnings of
healthcare provider moral distress and the scope of the definition, the
literature supports broad agreement that moral distress has measur-
able impact on patient safety, compassion fatigue, mental health, and
professional quality of life.11,12 Several authors have suggested that a
similar link exists in veterinary medicine.13,14
The purpose of our study was to investigate the hypothesis that
veterinarians frequently encounter ethical conflicts during the practice
of medicine that cause moral distress, yet may rarely label or recog-
nize these situations as ethical or moral in nature (ie, concerning
actions that run contrary to what is considered morally right, in con-
trast to other kinds of distress). The implicit assumption is that veteri-
narians may not consider commonly felt distress as being triggered by
a conflict between their actions and their personal morals. Instead,
they may perceive the situation as “sad” or “upsetting” without
acknowledging why. Our study was designed to document the exis-
tence of unlabeled ethical conflict in North American veterinary clini-
cal medicine and assess whether it is a frequent and relevant problem
for veterinarians. We sought to determine how much formal training
veterinarians received at any point in their training about how to
navigate these situations. Moreover, the frequency with which veteri-
narians disagree with requests by animal owners for certain kinds of
treatment such as futile or non-beneficial treatments was investi-
gated. Finally, we inquired about the nature and extent of the distress
that veterinarians feel in these situations and what coping methods
they have used.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Between June and September of 2017, a survey of veterinarians who
are currently or were formerly practicing in North America was
conducted. The participants were members of various professional
veterinary associations who received an email invitation to participate
directly from their organization or saw an invitation to participate in
newsletters or online postings. The professional member organiza-
tions that solicited
their members for participation were: the
University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine Alumni
Association, The International Veterinary Academy of Pain Manage-
ment, The Veterinary Emergency and Critical Care Society, The
American
College
of
Veterinary
Dentistry,
The
Massachusetts
Veterinary Medical Association, The Angell Animal Medical Center
Alumni Association, and the DVM/VMD staff members at The
ASPCA/Humane
Alliance
Shelter
Veterinarians,
The
College
of
Veterinary Medicine at Michigan State University, Angell Animal
Medical Center, and The Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine at
Tufts University. A notice soliciting participation was posted on the
message boards for the small animal internal medicine diplomates of
the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine and on the
Equine Vet-to-Vet Facebook page.
In addition to these participants, a small number of individuals
(30) who attended continuing education meetings at US veterinary
conferences in 2016 and 2017 voluntarily provided their email
addresses to the authors expressly for the purpose of taking the
survey.
No attempt was made to structure which veterinarians were
surveyed because the study was designed to use an opportunistic
sampling configuration.15

 Participants were invited to open the questionnaire in an email or
online posting that explained the purpose of the survey and contained
a URL link. Participation was entirely voluntary. Veterinarians who
chose to participate clicked on a link within the email that brought
them to an anonymous online 49 item questionnaire by Survey-
Monkey survey software. Please see the Supporting Information for
the entire set of questions posed. Although most questions had
options for answers offered via a drop down menu, some questions
asked for and allowed participants to provide free text answers.
Results were tabulated by SurveyMonkey survey software. The study
was approved by the Cambridge Health Alliance Institutional Review
Board.

See Table 1 and supporting informaion for numerical data. Eight hun-
dred and eighty-nine individuals responded to our survey. Respon-
dents were from all but 2 states in the United States, and 5% of
respondents were from Canada. Nineteen percent of our respondents
have been in practice for 1-5 years, 23.6% for 5-10 years, and 58%
for 10 years or longer. Respondents were approximately equally split
between generalist and specialist veterinarians and 93% were cur-
rently practicing veterinary medicine. A large variety of practice types
was represented, including companion animal, equine, food animal,
and exotic animal medicine. When asked about how many hours of
instruction or training they received in their veterinary training about
resolving differences of opinion about what is best care for patients,
most (71%) reported they had received no conflict resolution training.
When asked, “In your veterinary training, how many hours of instruc-
tion or training in self-care did you receive?” 79% of respondents
reported receiving no such training.

| The causes of ethical conflict
See Table 2 for numerical results. When asked how often they had
conflicts with pet owners about how to proceed with the care of their
patients, 32% said “often” and 53% said “sometimes.” Most (68%) said
they dealt with these situations by discussing them with colleagues
and 15% said they did nothing when these scenarios occurred.
Respondents were given the option of explaining in free text how
they dealt with this conflict. Many participants expressed their belief,
via free text answers, that ultimately, pet owners have the final say in
care decisions although many reported taking action when they dis-
agreed with an owner's decision. Participant responses included sev-
eral comments such as “The situations of [sic] just part of veterinary
practice” and “Honestly this doesn't bother me that much - their pet is
their property to do what they want/can do”. In contrast to those
comments, many comments indicated that, in some situations, veteri-
narians expressed their disagreement to the client and that discussion
may have included a refusal to provide continued care. Examples of
these answers included “Resolved it to our mutual satisfaction; very
rarely, have to respectfully fire the client” and “I try to find common
ground with owners. An owner cannot compel me to perform treat-
ments I consider inappropriate, just as I cannot compel them to elect
euthanasia. Rarely I have had to recuse myself from caring for a pet.”
Many veterinarians indicated, again via free text answers, that they
spend a great deal of time grappling with this problem in lengthy dis-
cussions with clients and peers.
In response to our question, “How often have you been asked to
do something in the course of your clinical practice that feels like the
wrong thing to do?” 45.3% said “sometimes” and 5.6% said “often.”
Although approximately 25% of respondents said they never complied
with these requests, 45% of respondents said they complied rarely,
23.6% said they sometimes did so, 7% said they often did so and <1%
said they always did so. Sixty-two percent of respondents stated that
sometimes or often they felt they could not “do the right thing.” Many
respondents in free text answers cited financial constraints as the
most common obstacle to doing what they felt was right, but some
also cited external pressure from an employer or management
policies.
With respect to euthanasia, 29.3% stated that they sometimes or
often receive what they consider to be inappropriate requests for the
procedure, and approximately 19% of respondents said they some-
times or often acceded to these requests. Almost 45% said it caused
them or their staff a moderate amount of distress and 18.7% reported
it caused them or their staff severe distress.
Seventy-nine percent of respondents said that they sometimes or
often have received requests to provide treatment that they consid-
ered futile. Approximately half of our respondents have refused such
requests.
3.3
| Moral distress levels and coping methods
Overall, 73% of respondents stated that not being able to do the right
thing for a patient caused their staff moderate to severe stress and
78% replied that it caused them moderate to severe distress.
Sixty-nine percent of respondents said they felt they had moder-
ate to severe amounts of distress as a result of not being able to pro-
vide care they thought was appropriate. When asked “How often
have you felt distressed or anxious about your work?” 35% of our
respondents reported “sometimes” and 43% answered “often.” When
asked how often they had been asked to do things that are outside of
their skill set for financial or other reasons, over 50% of our respon-
dents said that they sometimes or often were so asked.
Twenty-six percent of respondents said their empathy for their
patients had waned over time and 31% said that their empathy for
pet owners had waned over time, and 60% of respondents said they
feel like they have prioritized the needs of animal owners over their
patients.
When asked about coping mechanisms when they felt they could
not do the right thing, 11% said they had sought unspecified profes-
sional help. And when asked about how they coped when “a client

9% of respondents indicated that they sought professional help. In
both of these situations, over 75% of participants indicated that they
discussed the situation with a partner, friend, or colleague, whereas
approximately 20% responded that they “did nothing.”

DISCUSSION
Our study was undertaken to document and explore elements of the
problem of moral distress among North American veterinarians. After
a number of well-publicized suicides, the veterinary profession has
acknowledged the importance of good mental health and wellness as
a foundation of practice.16,17 A Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention survey of over 10 000 US veterinarians in 2014 determined
that more than 1 in 6 veterinarians might have experienced suicidal
ideation and nearly 1 in 10 may have serious psychological distress.18
Discussions of burnout, compassion fatigue and sustainability have
become regular features of continuing education seminars and, more
recently, veterinary school curricula. So far, little has been written
about the causes of these serious problems, although a reassuring sur-
vey of veterinary students disputed the suspicion that veterinarians
may be at higher risk than the general population for mental health
problems because of adverse childhood experiences.14,19,20
Our study findings show that veterinarians regularly face conflict
and ethical distress in the normal course of practice. The findings
implicate moral distress in generating feelings of burnout and compas-
sion fatigue, raising concern that moral distress may contribute to the
development of mental health problems among veterinarians. We join
other researchers in veterinary profession in urging that the roots of
stress and poor well-being in the veterinary community be fully
explored and addressed by professional societies.
Although our findings document that moral distress is common
among North American veterinarians, it differed from other related
studies conducted outside of North America in focusing more on the
impact and coping mechanisms in participant-identified clinical situa-
tions of ethical dilemmas.4,5 Additional differences from studies in
other regions likely come from differences in veterinary business
models, veterinary cultural practices, and societal norm differences.

 Our study also invited participants to contribute examples from their
own experience, adding detail to the results.
Our findings show that many veterinarians are distressed and
anxious about their work and are troubled by many of the requests
that are made of them. Many feel like they are just “going through the
motions” and although many are troubled, very few receive any pro-
fessional help. The majority of respondents who do take action to
cope with their distress talk with colleagues or others, presumably
informally, instead of seeking professional help.
Even if our findings are not broadly representative, they still are
highly concerning. They show that many veterinarians are not happy
in aspects of their work, feel discomfort and distress about various
elements of their work, and do not have many outlets for their dis-
tress. The results validate current concerns for the mental health and
well-being of veterinarians given that they suffer in the face of multi-
ple conflicts at work and utilize very few outlets for support and help.
Our study has some important limitations. Self-selection bias to
participate (particularly if respondents already felt distress) and vari-
able access to professional member organizations may have affected
the representativeness of participant characteristics and results.
Because of the structure of the survey questions, the results did not
allow tracking of responses by practice type or demographic. Although
the goal of documenting the frequency, severity, and common causes
of moral distress in individuals was achieved, the nonrandom survey
design precludes the ability to draw statistical, population-based con-
clusions about prevalence.
Given how little training participants reported in resolving differ-
ences of opinion regarding veterinary care and in personal self-care,
the implications of the findings are clear. They offer a clarion call for
increased awareness of moral distress and more instruction in ethical
conflict and self-care for veterinarians-in-training. A recent survey of
the American Veterinary Medical Association Council of Education-
accredited US veterinary school curricula found that 18 of 30 provided
dedicated courses in ethics.21 Because most respondents (>70%) did
not report any training in navigating ethical dilemmas, either the train-
ing they received did not provide enough practical guidance or ethics
in the curriculum is a relatively recent addition. Regardless of the
explanation, training in recognizing, naming, and navigating ethical
conflict as part of veterinary professional education could start to
address the problem. Normalizing the need for self-care and providing
practical training in self-care early in veterinary professional life could
help decrease the impact of ethical conflict.
Perhaps even more concerning is the idea that although US veter-
inarians are well aware of the mental and physical toll of practice,
there is little acknowledgment or understanding of the frequency and
role that ethical conflict plays. We hypothesize, based on our study
and experience in providing continuing education on navigating moral
distress to veterinarians, that several important reasons for this prob-
lem exist. The relative deficiency, compared to other regions in the
world, in the study and publication of research on veterinary ethical
conflict and moral distress is notable. Although it is unclear whether
this deficiency is cause, effect, or both, it may reflect both a lack of
ethical literacy and that these distressing situations are not viewed
through the lens of ethics. Many veterinarians wrote that they con-
sider these conflicts an inevitable part of veterinary practice. They
may accept ethical conflict as an inherent part of veterinary practice
without recognizing that it might be cumulatively damaging or that
they can mitigate its impact. One striking aspect of the comments is
that many view providing care with which they disagree as an
obligation because of animals' legal status as property although
(at least in the case of companion animals) owners strongly identify
their pets as family members rather than property, regardless of legal
definitions.22 The perception that veterinarians are duty-bound to
provide requested, but non-recommended, treatments suggests that
this feeling of obligation may come from within the veterinary culture
and professional ethics itself, perhaps reflecting a cultural conflict
between pets as family members and as property. Physicians struggle
with this feeling of obligation as well, even though they are not legally
or professionally ethically bound to provide non-beneficial care to
patients. Profession-wide discussions and exploration of the culture
surrounding provision of non-beneficial (ie, futile) care to veterinary
patients will be important in helping veterinarians decrease their moral
distress.
Recognizing, acknowledging, and labeling conflict and distress as
ethical in nature are important first steps in combating moral distress.
By means of lessons learned from research about nurses, we can work
to improve moral agency (ie, the ability or freedom to make moral
judgements and be held accountable), moral imagination (ie, viewing
conflict and situations through a lens of ethics), and developing a mor-
ally supportive community to decrease moral distress in our profes-
sion.23 We plan, in future interview-based research, to more fully
explore the obstacles faced in both recognizing and alleviating moral
distress. Our findings indicate the importance of considering moral
distress in future evaluations of risk factors for poor mental health
outcomes. We hope other investigators will undertake research to
define and examine potential links between moral distress and mental
health problems in veterinarians.
Addressing moral distress in veterinary medicine will require self-
assessment and adjustments in individual self-care, but without
changes in practice culture, business models, and other external fac-
tors that increase burnout and compassion fatigue, this problem will
only be partially solved. For example, veterinarians spend large
amounts of practice time discussing and negotiating non-medical deci-
sions with clients (eg, economic decisions, quality of life assessments).
Sharing this duty with other trained professionals, such as social
workers, might decrease the emotional burden of this kind of work.
Additionally, the relative lack of standardized guidelines for care in
veterinary medicine may improve moral agency among individual
veterinarians, but it might also increase the burden of using personal
judgment in deciding what care to offer. This may increase the ethical
dilemmas perceived by individual veterinarians. Potential institutional
solutions to moral distress include formation of ethics committees,
discussion and support groups, and ethics consultation services, as
exist in human hospitals and at 1 author's (Lisa Moses) clinical
institution.
Veterinarians would benefit from training and support in manag-
ing the distress they inevitably will feel in their everyday work. Our
findings indicate that, to date, such training and support have not yet
happened. We hope our findings as well as future research will lead to
supportive, positive changes that will make the practice of veterinary
