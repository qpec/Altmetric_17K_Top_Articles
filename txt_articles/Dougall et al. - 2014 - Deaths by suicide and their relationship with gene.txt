 Suicide is a significant public health concern in the UK and world-
wide. Contact with healthcare providers affords opportunities to
engage in suicide prevention and considerable interest exists in
establishing predictive information on which individuals accessing
healthcare services are most at risk. Consequently, studies have
explored suicide after discharge from psychiatric hospitals,
consistently reporting a peak incidence of suicide within 28
days,1–4 and a quarter of deaths occurring within 3 months, of
discharge.5 Only a few studies considered suicide after discharge
from pooled general and psychiatric hospital settings, highlighting
that most people had been in contact with healthcare services in
the year prior to death6,7 and that an estimated 7% and 13%
had been discharged within 1 month prior to death from general
and psychiatric hospitals respectively.8
This study uses records of completed suicides in Scotland over
a 30-year period to analyse patterns after last discharge by hospital
type (general or psychiatric) and according to summary categories
(psychiatric diagnosis or in a category of ‘injuries or poisonings’
coded at last general hospital episode). This UK-based study is
one of the largest to be reported, and we aimed to identify whether
there were potential alternative opportunities for suicide prevention.
Method
Study data
An extraction was made from the National Records of Scotland
(NRS) deaths register for the period from 1981 to 2010 of deaths
of people aged 15 years or older with underlying cause of death
coded as suicide as a result of intentional self-harm (ICD-9
E950–959; ICD-10 X60-84, Y87.0).9,10 The lower age cut-off was
selected as it follows other UK epidemiological studies of
suicide.11–13 Although it is conventional research practice to
subsume deaths of ‘undetermined intent’ within an overall
category of suicides, this study focused on those deaths that had
sufficient proof of suicidal intent (‘as a result of intentional self-
harm’). The NRS data-set could have been increased in size by
39% by adding in deaths coded as ‘undetermined events’
,
however we had no problems associated with sparse data, a
common
feature
of
other
suicide
studies,
and
excluding
undetermined events also ruled out any possibility of including
‘false positive’ data.
This study capitalises on Scotland’s privileged position as one
of a handful of countries that has digitised National Health Service
(NHS) hospital records that are linkable by a unique patient-
identifiable number (Community Health Index introduced in
1981).14 Up to 30 years of hospital-episode data for all deaths
by suicide was linked using the ‘Scottish Morbidity Records’
in-patient and day-case physical health episodes (‘SMR01’),
and in-patient and day-case mental health episodes (‘SMR04’).
Out-patient and maternity records were not included in the
data-set.
Problems of data quality are a well-known limitation of
administrative data sources – errors have the potential to arise,
for instance, because of coding or transcription errors in the
original production of data, and secondary researchers have little
opportunity to identify or address errors. A review of the data
revealed some anomalies that were likely to reflect data errors.
For instance, a number of the hospital episodes stemming from
individuals were erroneous and had to be excluded; some had
the wrong linked hospital records, some records were duplicates,
whereas others had valid records but contained month of

Background
Studies have rarely explored suicides completed following
discharge from both general and psychiatric hospital settings.
Such research might identify additional opportunities for
intervention.
Aims
To identify and summarise Scottish psychiatric and general
hospital records for individuals who have died by suicide.
Method
A linked data study of deaths by suicide, aged 515 years
from 1981 to 2010.
Results
This study reports on a UK data-set of individuals who died
by suicide (n = 16 411), of whom 66% (n = 10 907) had linkable
previous hospital records. Those who died by suicide were
3.1 times more frequently last discharged from general than
from psychiatric hospitals; 24% of deaths occurred within
3 months of hospital discharge (58% of these from a general
hospital). Only 14% of those discharged from a general
hospital had a recorded psychiatric diagnosis at last visit; an
additional 19% were found to have a previous lifetime
psychiatric diagnosis. Median time between last discharge
and death was fourfold greater in those without a psychiatric
history. Diagnoses also revealed that less than half of those
last discharged from general hospital had had a main
diagnosis of ‘injury or poisoning’.
Conclusions
Suicide prevention activity, including a better psychiatric
evaluation of patients within general hospital settings
deserves more attention. Improved information flow between
secondary and primary care could be facilitated by exploiting
electronic records of previous psychiatric diagnoses.

Data processing and variable operationalisation
Hospital episodes were coded on main and secondary diagnoses
contained in ICD-99 from 1981 to 1996, with a change to
ICD-1010 from 1 April 1996. Each record contained a main
diagnosis and up to ten possible secondary diagnoses. Summarising
diagnostic information at hospital visits necessitated harmonising
ICD codes to obtain consistent coding over time. We achieved this
by collapsing ICD codes into broader, clinically homogeneous
categories, using a tool called Clinical Classifications Software
(CCS) on Windows 7 Enterprise. Clinical Classifications Software
is part of a sponsored project by the US Agency for Healthcare
Research and Quality and is available to download.15,16 We used
the ‘special archival’ single-level diagnosis version, aggregating
all ICD-9 and ICD-10 diagnostic codes in our linked data-set
into 260 CCS meta-categories.
The linkage between ICD codes and CCS summary codes
required ICD codes to be stored in highly standardised formats.
Therefore,
as
is
common
practice
when
working
with
administratively collected data, substantial cleaning of the original
data was required to achieve this linkage (for example, of ‘main
diagnosis’ ICD records across all data-sets, 68% of all ICD codes
were re-processed in some manner to allow them to link with
the ICD formats used in the CCS tool). Extended algorithms were
written using Stata V11 on Windows 7 Enterprise, featuring tasks
such as removing spaces and ‘wildcard’ indicators such as ‘X’, and
changing when relevant the number of characters of detail, in
order to achieve a standardised ICD format. The Stata software
code used to do this (including the macros used to translate in
turn from ICD to CCS codes) has been published by the research
team so that it is available for other researchers. The code files are
available at www.dames.org.uk/docs/papers/appendices/smr_icd/.
These files have also been submitted to the UK’s ‘Administrative
Data Liaison Service’ (www.adls.ac.uk), which provides an online
pool for software code relevant to processing administrative data.
Following this processing exercise, approximately 5% of the
codes across the data-set could still not be successfully matched to
relevant ICD standardised codes as used in the CCS tool; for
instance 90% of these codes did not contain the expected alpha-
numeric values and the remaining 10% were conventionally
formatted ICD codes but linked to no known ICD standard. Both
patterns are consistent with data-processing errors at the point of
data collection that might be regarded as occurring randomly.
From the available diagnostic information designated by
the 260 CCS codes, we used relevant categories for psychiatric
diagnosis (CCS codes 65–75, corresponding to a broad category
approximately equating to codes 290–319 from ICD-9 and chapter
F, ICD-10). For self-harm we were restricted to using broad CCS
proxy categories of ‘any injury or poisoning’
. On SMR01, codes for
‘injury or poisoning’ generally appear as the main diagnosis code,
equating to CCS codes 225–244, with external causes of harm
(ICD-9 E-codes; ICD-10 X- and Y-codes) appearing only as
additional secondary diagnoses, equating to CCS code 260. These
codes include injury or poisoning of accidental origin as well as
assault or self-harm. Although not ideal in terms of focusing
specifically on self-harming behaviour, we decided to use these
codes in establishing any relative differences between demographic
groups.
Death record variables used included age, gender, marital
status (married/cohabiting or not) and employment status (‘not
in work’ or otherwise). We also obtained a linked Carstairs Index
quintile variable, a local area-based measure of deprivation17 that
was available for the entire time span of the data-set. Values were
individually assigned using the postcode recorded on the death
certificate. Descriptive data analysis was used in summarising
group characteristics and proportions of people who died after
different time points post last hospital discharge. We used Stata
V11 on Windows 7 Enterprise throughout.
This study was approved by Lothian Research Ethics Committee
(No.10/S1103/31), the Privacy Advisory Committee (PAC) of
NHS Information Services Division and the Registrar General of
NRS. Caldicott Guardian approval was granted as part of the
PAC approval.
Results
Overall cohort characteristics
The study time span, 1981–2010, covered 16 475 deaths by suicide,
consisting of 12 162 (74%) males and 4313 (26%) females. There
was a time-lag between deaths recorded and being linked to
hospital records; therefore we truncated the data-set at the end
of 2009, leaving 16 411 individuals for further analysis, of whom
5275 had no linked hospital records and 229 died in hospital
having no previous admission records, leaving 10 907 people with
a last discharge alive (Table 1).
Individuals who died by suicide with hospital records were
predominantly male (72%); had a mean age of 43; more
frequently living alone (63%); had a mean Carstairs quintile of
3.3 (slightly more deprived areas than population average); and
20% were not in work. Gender interacted with other measures:
males were significantly younger at death than females, and
significantly more women (34%) were not in work compared with
men (15%).

 Deaths by suicide and their relationship with hospital discharge
Comparison of people with and without previous hospital
records revealed further differences (Table 1). Men had accessed
secondary-care services less often than women (72% of deaths
with previous hospital records were men, compared with 78%
of deaths without previous records). In addition, people with
hospital records had more frequently been living alone than those
without such records (63% v. 57%) and higher proportions of
men with records were not in work compared with those without
records (15% v. 9%).
Suicide patterns in relation to last discharge from
pooled hospital settings
The 10 907 people with psychiatric or general hospital records
prior to death had a total of 66 188 records. This figure was arrived
at having removed 362 records with admission dates after the
death dates; 1016 records for being exact duplicate records of
another episode and 2002 records where the outcome was death
in hospital. The 66 188 records comprised 23% psychiatric
hospital records, however total population data from NHS
Information Services Division estimates that 32.8 million hospital
records were created nationwide over the same time span, of
which only 3% were psychiatric records.
Substantially more people who died by suicide were last
discharged from general rather than psychiatric hospitals – we
identified the last hospital discharge record for each of the
10 907, defining categories for those who had last been in general
hospital (n = 8263, 76%) or in psychiatric hospital (n = 2270,
21%). A further 374 people had ‘tied’ records, meaning they
had both general and psychiatric hospital admissions and transfers
between hospitals within the same last continuous period of care
(Table 2).
Of 16 411 deaths overall, 50% had a last discharge from
general hospital, 16% had a last discharge that included a
psychiatric hospital record and 34% had no prior hospital records.
A total of 16% of all deaths by suicide had occurred within 3
months of last discharge from any hospital (n = 2575/16 411), a
figure which amounts to about a quarter of all deaths among
previous hospital patients (n = 2575/10 907, 24%) in the same
period. Of all deaths, 9% (n = 1487/16 411) had been discharged
within 3 months from a general hospital, and a further 7%
(n = 180+908/16 411) had been discharged within 3 months from
a psychiatric hospital (including combined settings). Similarly,
32% of all deaths in Scotland by suicide were of those who had
been discharged from a hospital within the last year prior to death
(n = 5178/16 411); three-fifths of these (n = 3312) happened after
general hospital discharge and did not involve a linked psychiatric
episode.
Of the whole population who died by suicide, about half of all
male and female deaths occurred after last discharge from general
hospital (51% and 49% respectively). However, around 14% of
male compared with 22% of female deaths had occurred after last
discharge from psychiatric hospital (or a continuous episode of
care of both a general and a psychiatric hospital). This disparity
may well reflect that higher numbers of women are generally
admitted to psychiatric hospital in the first place, but may
nevertheless be indicative of how suicide prevention efforts should
be sensitive to differences between the experiences of men and
women in the hospital system.
Last discharge from general hospitals
with a diagnosis of injury or poisoning
Given the high volume of deaths arising after a last discharge from
general hospitals, we set out to provide high-level summaries of
whether people with a last discharge alive from a general hospital
had been diagnosed with ‘injury or poisoning’
, an aggregate
category of assaults, accidents and self-injuries.
Less than half of all individuals (n = 3179, 38%; Table 3) who
died after last discharge from general hospital had been given a
main or any secondary diagnosis of ‘injury or poisoning’, of whom
22% (n = 705) had completed suicide within 3 months of last
discharge, 33% (n = 1047/3179) by 6 months and two-thirds
(n = 2154) within 1 year of last discharge.
Young men were the most prominent group in this category:
men aged 15–45 comprised by far the largest category of people
who died after a last discharge with a diagnosis of ‘injury or
poisoning’ in general hospital (60% of all deaths, n= 1917). By
comparison, 19% of deaths from this group were of men aged over
45; whereas 13% were of women aged 15–45 and 9% were women
over 45 (Table 3).
Among those deaths that occurred after last discharge from
general hospital, we found that 62% (n = 5125/8263) had
previously received a diagnosis of ‘injury or poisoning’ in any of
their previous hospital records over their lifetime (within the
observation period 1981–2009). Indeed, of those with a last
discharge following a diagnosis of ‘injury or poisoning’
, 41%
(n = 1313/3179) had either a psychiatric disorder recorded at last
hospital visit, or had a psychiatric diagnosis included at any time
previously in their hospital records.
It seems likely therefore that there is potential to identify an
at-risk population in general hospital settings where prevention
work or mental health assessment could take place for those not
being currently admitted for ‘injury or poisoning’ but who have
had any previous lifetime record for ‘injury or poisoning’ or
psychiatric disorder (or both), and would otherwise appear as
‘invisible’ to healthcare staff at time of any current admission.

 Dougall et al
proportions were cohabiting than not (30% compared with 37%
respectively); but there were no other noticeable differences.
Last discharge from general hospitals
and psychiatric morbidity prevalence
Psychiatric disorders may also be relevant to suicide patterns for
those with a last discharge from general hospital. We found that
14% of all those who completed suicide after last being discharged
from general hospital had a psychiatric disorder recorded at the
last hospital episode (either as a main or secondary diagnosis).
This group had a median time to death of 7 months from last
discharge, suggesting that this is an important risk indicator
(Table 4).
The category of people who had no psychiatric disorder
recorded during their last (general hospital) episode, but did have
a psychiatric disorder recorded at some point previously in their
lifetime amounted to 19% (n = 1597/8263) of those last discharged
from general hospital, of whom 30% (n = 450/1487) died within 3
months of last discharge, and the overall median time until death
was 9 months. This indicates that in many instances where a
person is admitted to a general hospital, a prior record of
psychiatric disorder may be a relevant indicator of suicide risk.
On the other hand, 67% of those last discharged from general
hospital had no psychiatric diagnosis ever recorded anywhere in
their hospital records. In contrast to the first two groups, this
group had a much longer median time between discharge and
death (33 months).
To reiterate: those last discharged from general hospital with
the shortest median time until death (7 months) were those
who had a recorded comorbid psychiatric diagnosis at last hospital
visit, followed by those who did not have a recorded psychiatric
diagnosis at last general hospital visit but did have a diagnosis
previously within their lifetime (median time to death of
9 months).
The same proportion of men and women had psychiatric
disorders recorded at last general hospital visit (14%; Table 4).
However, substantially more men than women who died after a
recorded hospital episode had no psychiatric disorders recorded
at any point in their lifetime (69% v. 60%; Table 4), whereas fewer
men (17%) compared with women (26%) had no psychiatric
disorder recorded at last visit but did have a previous psychiatric
disorder along the life course, patterns that would be consistent
of a relative underrepresentation of men in accessing hospital
psychiatric services. Although we had expected to see an increase
in hospital records with age in line with a cumulative diagnostic
accrual along the lifespan, we found that the proportion of males

Lastly, Fig. 1 shows the percentage of suicides occurring within
different time spans since last discharge from general hospitals
(recorded in SMR01) or from psychiatric hospitals (recorded in
SMR04). Although fewer suicides involve last discharge from a
psychiatric hospital, the temporal pattern suggests that most
suicides involving people discharged from such facilities occurred
in relatively shorter time periods since the last discharge. This is in
contrast to the pattern of suicide following discharge from a
general hospital, where relatively more deaths occur at longer
intervals since the last recorded discharge. This is not so surprising
if admission/readmission patterns to hospital are related to suicide
risk and merits further analysis of hospital utilisation patterns
prior to suicide.
Discussion
Main findings
This study reports on a large linked UK data-set of individuals
who died from suicide, spanning 1981–2009. One-third of those
who died by suicide had no previous hospital records whatsoever
(although there is the possibility of previous hospital admissions
in another country), and half of all deaths by suicide were of
people who had been last discharged from general hospital.
Deaths by suicide in individuals with hospital records were
more than three times more frequently last discharged from a
general hospital than a psychiatric hospital. This was higher than
anticipated, but is perhaps not that surprising since there are
many more admissions to general than psychiatric hospital among
the national population. It is revealing however, to compare the
time spans between discharge and death in relation to last
discharge type; many deaths occurred relatively soon after a
previous discharge from either category, suggesting opportunities
for intervention may exist in both settings. Examination of
diagnoses revealed that less than half of those last discharged from
general hospital had received a diagnosis of ‘injury or poisoning’;
potentially suggestive of subsequent self-harm, with more than
half of these being younger men.
Despite having died by suicide, we found only a small minority
(14%) had a recorded comorbid psychiatric diagnosis at last general
hospital visit, but that an additional 19% had received a previous
psychiatric diagnosis during their lifetime; the median times to
death when there was a psychiatric diagnosis at last discharge was
7 months, and 9 months for those with any previous psychiatric
history; this was in marked contrast to 33 months for people
who had no (hospital) psychiatric diagnosis history whatsoever.
Limitations of the study
The general hospital data-set (SMR01) permits identification of
individuals transferred to other NHS hospitals and psychiatric
facilities but does not allow for capturing hospital episodes of
people who present to accident and emergency departments and
who subsequently self-discharge or who are not then admitted to
hospital. Therefore it is likely that there is an underrepresentation
of people in crisis in the data-set who have presented to hospital;
the numbers dying by suicide after contact with general hospitals
are likely to be higher than this analysis suggests.
This study does not link to primary care or hospital out-patient
data. An analysis of all secondary- and primary-care linked records
would have provided
a more comprehensive approach in
summarising healthcare contacts prior to suicide; however, this
was beyond the scope of this study. The data used for this study
do not contain deaths deemed to be ‘events of undetermined
intent’ and we recognise that in ruling out possible ‘false positive’
suicide deaths, we have potentially missed many additional
genuine records (estimated as an additional 6640 individuals
for the time span 1981 to 2010; see NRS official statistics, www.
gro-scotland.gov.uk/statistics/theme/vital-events/deaths/suicides/
index.html).
With respect to using the broad category of ‘injury or
poisoning’, this approach was suboptimal as a proxy for self-harm
as the data were conflated with all accidents and assaults. However,
this makes the low numbers of people last discharged from a
general hospital with a diagnosis of ‘injury or poisoning’ even
more surprising. There remains potential to use more detailed

accrual of hospital records for those who died early in the 1980s
and soon after the data-set capture of hospital records. This means
that the prior hospital episodes of some cases are left-censored
(if they had prior episodes before 1981). Such imbalances would
be quite typical of any practical system that tried to use
administrative data to enhance decision-making, for which reason
we think it was appropriate to conduct the analysis in terms of
deaths since 1981 and their relationship to hospital records since
1981. We also note that our data included months as the most
detailed time point for an episode – this raised practical, but
not insurmountable, problems in determining the last episode
(if more than one episode was held in the same month), although
again this is commensurate with the sort of data resources that
might be pragmatically available. In addition, there may be
significant disclosure risks were data provided identifying exact
dates of hospital episodes and deaths.
Finally, for operational reasons the data-set we used was
restricted to deaths by suicide. Although a strength of the data
is the nationwide coverage (with no inherent selection bias), this
was a single group study, and in further work a comparison of this
group with other non-suicide cohorts or case–controls has
obvious attractions and could yield important information on
relative risks.
Comparison with previous studies
Studies exploring suicide patterns after last discharge from pooled
clinical settings are relatively scarce and most do not have control
groups. Where studies exist, these tend to focus on patterns after
discharge from psychiatric facilities, after episodes of self-harming
behaviour, or in estimating the number and frequency of contacts
with health services in the time prior to suicide. Analyses suggest
that at least 80% of people who die by suicide had some contact
with healthcare services in the year prior to death,6,7,18 with more
than double the number of contacts being made for those who
died by suicide compared with those who did not;7 however, it
remains unclear whether these contacts with healthcare services
had a role in suicide prevention by delaying the event.
Andersen et al pooled hospital and primary care records in
Denmark to report that within the last month before death, 66%
had consulted a general practitioner and 7% and 13% had been
discharged from general and psychiatric hospitals respectively.8
We report a different pattern to that of Andersen et al, namely that
in the 3 months before death, 9% and 7% had been discharged
from
general
and
psychiatric
hospitals
respectively.
These
differences could in part be explained by the much smaller sample
size in the Andersen et al study (n = 472) but could also be a
feature of the data time span, which was restricted to the early
1990s, a period during which many European countries replaced
older psychiatric institutions with community mental health
services.
We also found that the percentage of deaths from suicide after
last discharge from general hospital continued to rise over time, in
a different pattern to that after admission to a psychiatric hospital,
which appeared to decrease in a more exponential pattern with
time since discharge, a pattern reported elsewhere.19 Considering
only those deaths by suicide following last discharge from
psychiatric hospitals, a peak incidence of suicide occurred within
the 3 months following discharge, in agreement with other studies
that report peak incidences within a month after discharge.1–4,20
However, a report from Sweden suggests that the majority of
deaths with psychiatric diagnosis had been discharged from
psychiatric treatment for more than 1 month before suicide21
and that ‘doctor shopping’ behaviour can vary markedly by age
and gender with, for example, women’s contact with psychiatrists
increasing during the year prior to suicide then dropping
significantly shortly before suicide.22
Future research
An analysis of data incorporating other healthcare records (for
example primary care, emergency department, ambulance service)
would offer a more comprehensive understanding of patterns of
service
utilisation.
Although
this
study
summarises
only
secondary-care records, there are initiatives in pooling data
sources, creating richer sources of information that may afford
opportunities to glean further insights.23 Data-sets such as the
one used in this analysis are rich sources of information and yield
further opportunities in, for example, summarising morbidity
burden, prevalent diagnoses along the life course, temporal
patterns in suicide or in making more use of individual-level data
such as ICD codes for self-harm or occupation held in the death
record.
Further exploration of reasons why relatively more men than
women who die by suicide have no psychiatric records is
warranted, and also whether this apparent underrepresentation
of men accessing hospital psychiatric services is related to gender
differences in help-seeking behaviour within primary care.
Implications for practice
This study highlights that engaging in suicide prevention within
the general hospital setting deserves much more attention.
Targeted follow-up of people admitted to general hospital with
self-harm diagnoses (in particular younger men), and screening
for psychological problems in those where there has been either
a history of self-harming or of any psychiatric condition along
the life course could be beneficial. This would require making
better use of historical and electronic health records and ensuring
all hospital staff could engage in some first-line mental health
screening in these ‘at risk’ patients.
Although we found that the majority of people discharged
from general hospital had no recorded psychiatric morbidity in
hospital records, this does not preclude the possibility of
psychiatric problems being managed exclusively in primary care.
There is potential for better information flow from primary to
secondary care (such as relevant episodes of depression or anxiety)
to yield useful additional clinical insights, which could be
particularly relevant for unscheduled admissions. Many of the
people in the study had no hospital records at all, which also
highlights the need for adequate community and primary care
mental health resources.
In summary, we report that higher percentages of people died
by suicide after 3, 6 and 12 months after last discharge from
general than from psychiatric hospitals. Less than half of these
had a main diagnosis of ‘injury of poisoning’, a category in which
young men were most affected. The median time to death was
about fourfold longer for those without any current or previous
psychiatric history. More could be done in engaging with suicide
intervention, psychiatric evaluation and follow-up of people who
are admitted to general hospitals with self-harm history or
psychiatric comorbidity, past or present.
