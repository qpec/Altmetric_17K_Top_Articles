ABSTRACT
Background Knowledge of injury patterns, an
essential step towards injury prevention, is lacking in
youth handball.
Aim To investigate if an increase in handball load is
associated with increased shoulder injury rates compared
with a minor increase or decrease, and if an association
is influenced by scapular control, isometric shoulder
strength or glenohumeral range of motion (ROM).
Methods 679 players (14–18 years) provided weekly
reports on shoulder injury and handball load (training
and competition hours) over 31 weeks using the SMS,
phone and medical examination system. Handball load in
a given week was categorised into (1) <20% increase or
decrease (reference), (2) increase between 20% and
60% and (3) increase >60% relative to the weekly
average amount of handball load the preceding 4 weeks.
Assessment of shoulder isometric rotational and
abduction strength, ROM and scapular control was
performed at baseline and midseason.
Results An increase in handball load by >60% was
associated with greater shoulder injury rate (HR 1.91;
95% CI 1.00 to 3.70, p=0.05) compared with the
reference group. The effect of an increase in handball
load between 20% and 60% was exacerbated among
players with reduced external rotational strength (HR
4.0; 95% CI 1.1 to 15.2, p=0.04) or scapular dyskinesis
(HR 4.8; 95% CI 1.3 to 18.3, p=0.02). Reduced
external rotational strength exacerbated the effect of an
increase above 60% (HR 4.2; 95% CI 1.4 to 12.8,
p=0.01).
Conclusions A large increase in weekly handball load
increases the shoulder injury rate in elite youth handball
players; particularly, in the presence of reduced external
rotational strength or scapular dyskinesis.
INTRODUCTION
Shoulder pain and problems represent a significant
health burden in senior handball, with reported
point prevalence proportions of shoulder pain
between 19% and 36% at season start,1–3 and
average weekly prevalence proportions of shoulder
problems of 28% during the season.1 Also, shoul-
der pain in senior players has been reported to
have an impact on the athletes’ performance, train-
ing activities1–3 and daily life.2 Early identification
and modification of risk factors in youth handball
are thus warranted for primary prevention of the
subsequent
musculoskeletal
disorders
in
adults.
However, knowledge about the incidence and risk
factors, the integral first step towards injury preven-
tion,4 is lacking in this age group.
Traditionally, studies have investigated associa-
tions between non-participation-related risk factors,
such as glenohumeral range of motion (ROM),1 5–8
shoulder strength1 7 9 10 and scapular control,1 11–13
and risk of shoulder injuries among overhead ath-
letes. However, sports injury research needs to move
from simple analyses of risk factors and concentrate
on how these factors interact among other determi-
nants for injury.14 Injury occurrence results from a
combination of possessing different risk factors and
participating with these risk factors.15 On this
premise, handball participation must be considered
a primary risk factor for shoulder injury, while
non-participation-related risk factors like strength,
glenohumeral ROM and scapular control influence
the amount of handball participation a player can
tolerate before shoulder injury occurs.16
As a measure of participation, several studies
have investigated the relationship between training
load and injuries in a variety of sports other than
handball, and there is growing evidence that a
rapid increase in training load increases the risk of
overall injury.17 18 However, no studies have inves-
tigated if the vulnerability to a rapid increase in
competition and training load is influenced by
non-participation-related risk factors.
The objectives of the present study of elite ado-
lescent handball players were to investigate if
increases in weekly handball load, defined as the
cumulative volume of training and competition
hours, are associated with increased shoulder injury
rates compared with a minor increase or decrease,
and if an association is influenced by scapular
control, isometric shoulder strength and glenohum-
eral ROM. The following a priori defined hypoth-
eses (H) were tested:
H1. Players who increase their handball load by
more than 60% in 1 week, relative to the weekly
average of the preceding 4 weeks of handball
load, have an increased shoulder injury rate com-
pared with those who increase or decrease below
20%.
H2. The association between a moderate increase
in handball load (i.e., 20–60% load) and shoul-
der injury rate will be exacerbated in players
with abnormal shoulder characteristics (scapular
dyskinesis, reduced shoulder isometric strength
and abnormal shoulder ROM). No exacerbation
in the association between a high increase in
weekly handball load (ie, increase above 60%)
and shoulder injury rate will exist in players with
abnormal shoulder characteristics.

The players were recruited from August to October 2013.
Players who were not enrolled at baseline were allowed to enter
the
study
at
midseason
(1
January
to
1
March
2014).
Methodological data from this study have previously been
reported
(Personal
communication,
2016.
M
Møller,

W
edderkopp, G Myklebust, et al. The SPEx sport injury surveil-
lance system is a feasible and valid approach to measure expo-
sures and injuries in elite youth sport). According to the Danish
Act on Research Ethics Review of Health Research Projects, The
Ethics Committee of Central Denmark Region deemed the
study to be exempt from full ethical review (request 89/2013)
due to the study design (observational study). Permission for the
study was granted by the Danish Data Protection Agency (File
2013-41-2137).
Participants
Players were recruited from all Danish First Division U-18
(range 16–18 years of age) teams and First Division U-16 (range
14–16 years of age) teams from clubs as described previously
(Personal communication, 2016. M Møller, et al.). All players
irrespective of current or previous shoulder pain were eligible
for participation in the study. However, players were excluded if
they reported a history of (1) previous shoulder surgery, (2) pre-
vious glenohumeral dislocation, (3) glenoid labrum tear, (4)
rotator cuff tear or (5) fracture in the shoulder region within
the previous 6 months.
Outcome
The primary outcome of interest was any new shoulder injury
in the dominant arm, defined as any handball-related shoulder
problem irrespective of the need for time loss or medical atten-
tion. Injury status was monitored continuously during follow-up
using the SMS, phone and medical examination sports injury
surveillance (SPEx) system, which has been described in detail
elsewhere (Personal communication, 2016. M Møller, et al).
Briefly, SPEx obtains weekly injury and handball participation
information from players by SMS messaging and, in a case of
injury, telephone interview, and physical examination by medical
personnel within 1–2 weeks.
The outcome was based on the players’ response to the fol-
lowing SMS question in SPEx: Have you been able to participate
in
handball
training
and
match
WITHOUT any
physical
problems (pain, discomfort, soreness, stiffness) or medical atten-
tion or illness during the past week? Injuries were classified as
shoulder injury based on the follow-up telephone interview.
Primary exposure
The primary exposure of interest was the weekly change
(increase or decrease) in handball playing load defined and cal-
culated as the amount of hours of handball playing (training
and match hours)18 derived from players’ SMS answers in SPEx
in the current week divided by the weekly average amount of
playing hours during the preceding 4 weeks.19 For the analyses,
we decided a priori to categorise the player’s weekly reports of
handball load into the following three primary exposure groups:
(1) <20% increase or decrease, (2) between 20% and 60%
increase or (3) >60% increase in handball load. The cut-off
values were chosen based on the weekly mean handball playing
hours (estimated to be ∼5 hours/week) in injury-free weeks.
Normally this is based on two to three handball-training activ-
ities and one match. An increase of 1 hour (20% increase)
would be equal to one extra weekly activity, whereas an increase
of 60% would equal two or three extra weekly handball
activities.
Also, 4-week average periods below 0.74 hours (equals a
z-score of −2) were categorised into a fourth group so that a
small increase in handball activities within a current week fol-
lowing a very low preceding 4-week average would be excluded
from the three primary groups.20 Furthermore, the first 4 weeks
of participation in the study, in which it was impossible to calcu-
late the previous 4 weeks’ average, were included in the analyses
as a fifth group.
Effect measure modifiers
Factors included in the statistical analyses as modifiers of the
effect of handball load on shoulder injuries were the shoulder
assessments for scapular control,21 isometric rotational and
abduction strength and ROM. (Personal communication, 2016.
M Møller, J Attermann, G Myklebust, et al. The reliability of
field-based measures of shoulder function in elite youth ath-
letes). All strength measures were adjusted for body weight.
W
e created cubic splines with 4 knots (using Stata’s mkspline
command; Stata 14, StataCorp LP
, College Station, T
exas, USA)
to dichotomise the continuous shoulder ROM and strength
assessments. Shoulder assessments were thus included in the
analyses as presented in table 1.
At baseline, all players attended a shoulder assessment session
in the players’ club. W
e aimed to repeat all shoulder assessments
for all accepting players during the midseason from 1 January
to 1 March 2014.
Owing to poor reliability and agreement, the isometric
strength measurement procedures were modified according to
our previous results (Personal communication, 2016. M Møller,
et al). W
e recruited four physiotherapists to perform the shoul-
der assessments for each assessment parameter. The physiothera-
pists were blinded to the player’s SMS injury and exposure
reports. For each physiotherapist, we investigated the test–retest
reliability on 19 male u-18 handball players (ROM, isometric
strength). Inter-reliability for scapular dyskinesis were evaluated
on 20 physiotherapy students. During the main study, the physio-
therapist assessing ROM stopped after baseline measurements
and was replaced with another, whose reliability previously has
been established. The shoulder assessment procedures, reliability
results and applied statistics are described in detail in online
supplementary appendices 1 and 2.

 Statistical analysis
Cox proportional hazards regression with frailty was used to
estimate hazard ratios (HRs) using calendar weeks as time-
scale.22 All observations, in which the players did not report
any playing time, were excluded from the analyses. The
primary exposure (change in handball load) was included in
the analyses as a time-dependent exposure.23 Using this
approach allowed us to take the players’ weekly change in
handball load into account by enabling all players to transit
between the three primary exposure groups by the end of each
week during the 31-week follow-up using delayed entry. The
categorisation of handball load and the corresponding transi-
tion between them was based solely on the player’s responses
to the SMS questions. Increase below 20% or decrease in
handball load was chosen as the reference group because we
hypothesised such players would have the lowest injury rate.
T
est for no difference between survival functions in the three
primary exposure groups was used to examine if a difference
across the three primary exposure groups existed. Similar to
change in handball load, the shoulder assessments (effect
measure modifiers) were included as time-dependent covari-
ates, providing players with shoulder follow-up measurements
the possibility to transit between strata after ∼15 weeks.
Players not tested at follow-up kept their baseline shoulder
assessment throughout the study. Handball-specific injuries
unrelated to dominant shoulder injuries were included as com-
peting risks. Players were not censored in case of an injury but
were censored in case of lack of motivation, or by the end of
the 31-week follow-up, whichever came first. The assumption
of proportional rates was evaluated by log-minus-log plots.
Shoulder injury incidence rate was calculated as the number of
new and recurrent injuries during the study divided by the sum
of exposure hours expressed in 1000 hours of total exposure
hours (match and training). Poisson regression was used to esti-
mate the incidence rate as a function of follow-up time in
weeks and to test if this varied over time points during the
season. p Values were considered statistically significant at
p≤0.05. Medicine students, blinded to the purpose of this
study, performed the data entry. All statistical analyses were
unblinded conducted in Stata V
.14.1 software (StataCorp,
College Station, T
exas, USA).
RESULTS
The details of the participant flow and the demographics of the
study population have previously been reported (M Møller,
et al. 2016. In review). The sample of 679 players (44%
female), representing 52 teams (of these, 37 U-18), reported
709 new injuries classified by telephone interviews via the SPEx
system. Of these, we classified 106 (14%) as shoulder injuries
(85 in the dominant arm) incurred during 73 546 playing
hours, which corresponds to an incidence rate of 1.4 (95% CI
1.2 to 1.7) per 1000 playing hours. There was a significant
change in risk of new shoulder injury during the season
(p<0.001) (figure 1).
The risk factor analysis included 68 shoulder injuries sus-
tained in the dominant arm (eight players and 17 injuries were
excluded from the analysis after excluding observations with
zero handball load the preceding week). Of the 68 injuries, six
players sustained two injuries. Thirty-three out of 68 injuries
(49%) were classified as traumatic. The number of players tested
and included for each effect measure modification analysis are
listed in figure 2.
Table 2 illustrates the number of weeks at risk by an increase
in handball load groups according to baseline factors.
The crude analysis of the increase in handball exposure above
60% was associated with an increased shoulder injury rate com-
pared with those increasing <20% (table 3).
Scapular dyskinesis and decreased external rotational strength
in 30° rotation significantly modified the effect of handball load
if players increased handball load between 20% and 60%
(scapular dyskinesis and external rotational strength) or above
60% (external rotational strength). No significant differences
across strata of shoulder ROM or abduction strength were
found (table 4). W
e found no differences between the three
primary exposure groups in any of the analyses (p values from
0.09 to 0.68).
DISCUSSION
The present study is the first large cohort study investigating the
synergy between participation-related and non-participation-
related risk factors for shoulder injuries in sports.
A noticeable effect size (HR=1.91) was observed in the crude
analysis. The injury rate was greater among players who increased

 their handball load by more than 60% compared with those
players who decreased or increased their handball load below
20%. In addition, scapular dyskinesis and decreased external
strength at 30° rotation exacerbated the effect among players
increasing in handball load to a moderate extent (20–60%).
Our a priori hypotheses were supported by these findings.
They indicate that a 60% increase in handball load can increase
the shoulder injury rate even in players with normal shoulder
characteristics. Also, scapular dyskinesis and reduced external
rotational strength make players prone to shoulder injury at a

 moderate increase in handball load, compared with players with
normal
scapular
control
and
external
rotational
strength.
Importantly, though, if players with scapular dyskinesis or
reduced external rotation strength do not increase their handball
load by more than 20%, they are not more predisposed to
shoulder injury compared with players with normal character-
istics. These findings suggest that large weekly increases in hand-
ball load are the primary risk factor for shoulder injuries in
youth handball. However, reduced external rotational strength
also accentuated the effect of handball load on shoulder injury
rate at an increase in handball load above 60%, which may indi-
cate that the cut point between a moderate and high increase in
handball load should exceed 60%.
W
e found no significant differences across strata of shoulder
abduction and ROM measurements. In fact, there were very
small differences in ROM between dominant and non-dominant
shoulders (results not shown), and it is likely that the normal
soft tissue or/and bony adaptations to the repeated throwing
reported in senior female handball2 and from a variety of other
sports8 24–28 are not yet present in youth handball players.
In general, our results cannot be compared with those of
other studies investigating non-participation-related risk factors,
as to the best of our knowledge no other studies in overhead
sport have examined the synergy between training and competi-
tion load and non-participation-related risk factors, but instead
compare the crude association between non-participation-related
risk factors and the subsequent risk of injury, or do not take
sport participation into account.1 5–13 29
The reported shoulder injury rate of 1.4 per 1000 playing
hours was 2.5 times higher (incidence rate ratio 2.5, 95% CI
1.6 to 4.0) than the reported shoulder injury rate of 0.6 per
1000 playing hours previously reported in a similar population
using a time-loss definition as injury outcome.30
Methodological considerations
The present study’s major strength is the applied statistical analysis
that takes the dynamic changing nature of risk factors into
account.15 However, our analyses are limited by the number of
events that are required to perform these analyses. The effect modi-
fier analyses were further limited by the fact that not all players
were tested, which reduced the number of included injuries.
Information problems
Recall bias is limited for injury and handball load reports owing
to the high weekly response rates (88–97%) to the SMS part in
SPEx and the 95% follow-up rates by telephone classification.
Still, the comparisons between injury outcomes from SPEx and
on-field and medical observers demonstrated that 10% of all
injury registrations were missed by the SPEx sports injury
surveillance
system,
indicating
a
risk
of
misclassification.
Furthermore, although most players responded rapidly to the
SMS messages, it is evident that some players reported their
injuries with a delay of 1 week or more (Personal communica-
tion, 2016. M Møller, N W
edderkopp, G Myklebust, et al. The
SPEx sport injury surveillance system is a feasible and valid
approach to measure exposures and injuries in elite youth
sport). This is particularly relevant in the applied analyses
where the change in handball load the week before an injury
was investigated. However, we find it plausible to assume that
the potential misclassification of injury status is similar across
handball load groups. If this is the case, such non-differential
misclassification may lead to bias towards null (no difference in
shoulder injury rate between handball load groups). Hence, the
association between change in handball load and shoulder injur-
ies is underestimated.
As regards the registration of handball load, we believe that
the use of the SPEx sports injury surveillance system ensures
more accurate results than would have been obtained in studies
analysing handball exposure at a group level using observational
methods. Still, there is a risk that some players have been mis-
classified into wrong weekly exposure groups during the season.
However, the players were unaware of the purpose of the ana-
lyses. Consequently, they likely have not been motivated to
either under-report or over-report their shoulder injuries. Any
potential misclassification must thus be non-differential leading
to an underestimation of the association between change in
handball load and shoulder injuries.
The fact that the same physiotherapists, except for ROM,
assessed the players’ shoulder profiles twice during the study in
order to accommodate the changing injury risk profile through-
out the season was a key strength of the present study. The cut
points in which the continuous strength and ROM measure-
ments could be translated into dichotomous risk factors were
defined in this study. These cut-off values would determine if a
player was at increased risk of injury or not. It should be noted
that there is a high risk of categorising players into wrong
exposure group due to random measurement error, even
though, we found no systematic bias and less wide limits of
agreement for the newly developed strength and ROM assess-
ments than previously reported (see online supplementary
appendix 2). The physiotherapists were blinded to previously
reported injuries before the follow-up, and also to the selected
cut points. This limits the risk that the physiotherapists uninten-
tionally have influenced the measurements in a particular direc-
tion. Therefore, the potential misclassification of the shoulder
assessments may have been non-differential leading to an under-
estimation between the sports participation, the given effect
modifier and the shoulder injury.
The above-mentioned potential misclassifications might have
prevented us from detecting other associations between handball
load and shoulder injury (type 2 error).
Selection problems
U-16 teams were invited to participate in this study only if their
U-18 team accepted to take part in this research. Consequently,
there is a possibility that the U-16 players included in this study
were from more elite clubs, and their handball load habits
might not reflect those u-16 players at less elite clubs. Less elite
clubs may also have limited recourses, lack of access to medical

 and support staff. Therefore, these players may sustain more
injuries than the u-16 players linked with an elite club partici-
pating in this study. This potentially skewed ‘healthy player’
selection might have led to selection bias in this age group.
W
e found no significant differences in hazards for injuries
between players who attended the shoulder assessments and
players who did not, limiting the risk of skewed selection, and
thus selection bias.
Confounding
There is a high risk of known and unknown confounding due
to the inherent nature of the prospective study design. The
potential confounders were, a priori, assumed to be playing pos-
ition and previous injuries. However, due to the low frequency
of shoulder injuries reported in the present study, it was not
possible to control for these factors within the analyses, and this
is a limitation of this study.
CONCLUSION
Our findings demonstrated that the shoulder injury rate in elite
youth handball players was nearly twice as high in the week fol-
lowing a 60% or greater increase in handball load when com-
pared with a decrease or a small-to-moderate increase in
handball load <20%.
In addition, the findings showed that an effect of a moderate
increase between 20% and 60% in handball load was exacer-
bated by the presence of reduced external rotational strength or
scapular dyskinesis and that reduced shoulder external rota-
tional strength also exacerbated the effect of large increases in
handball load above 60%. Finally, we found 2.5 times higher
shoulder injury incidence rate among 14–18-year-old handball
players than previously reported.

What are the findings?
▸ Large increase in weekly handball load is associated with an
increased rate of shoulder injuries in youth handball.
▸ Scapular dyskinesis and reduced external rotational strength
reduce the amount of increase in handball load a player can
tolerate before injury occurs.
▸ Shoulder injury incidence in youth handball is more than
twice as high as previously reported.
How might it impact on clinical practice in the future?
Coaches and support personnel should monitor youth handball
players’ handball load on an individual basis. Concerted efforts
should be made to avoid rapid increases in handball load.
Particularly for players with scapular dyskinesis and reduced
strength, because players with these certain characteristics may
be more vulnerable to shoulder injury already at a moderate
increase in handball load.
