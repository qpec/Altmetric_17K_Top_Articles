 The growing popularity of unpasteurized milk in the United 
States raises public health concerns. We estimated outbreak-
related illnesses and hospitalizations caused by the con-
sumption of cow’s milk and cheese contaminated with Shiga 
toxin–producing Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp., Listeria 
monocytogenes, and Campylobacter spp. using a model re-
lying on publicly available outbreak data. In the United States, 
outbreaks associated with dairy consumption cause, on aver-
age, 760 illnesses/year and 22 hospitalizations/year, mostly 
from Salmonella spp. and Campylobacter spp.  Unpasteurized 
milk, consumed by only 3.2% of the population, and cheese, 
consumed by only 1.6% of the population, caused 96% of 
illnesses caused by contaminated dairy products. Unpas-
teurized dairy products thus cause 840 (95% CrI 611–1,158) 
times more illnesses and 45 (95% CrI 34–59) times more 
hospitalizations than pasteurized products. As consumption 
of unpasteurized dairy products grows, illnesses will increase 
steadily; a doubling in the consumption of unpasteurized milk 
or cheese could increase outbreak-related illnesses by 96%.
C
onsumer demand for organic and natural foods (i.e., 
minimally processed foods) has been on the rise (1). 
However, in contrast to some perceptions (2), natural food 
products are not necessarily safer than conventional ones, as 
evidenced by higher rates of foodborne illnesses associated 
with unpasteurized dairy products (3–6). Pasteurization has 
greatly reduced the number of foodborne illnesses attributed 
to dairy products, and continuous efforts to reduce milk con-
tamination pre- and post-pasteurization are further decreas-
ing the disease burden (3). Yet, despite a decrease in dairy 
consumption in the United States (7), recent studies (3,6) 
suggest that over the past 15 years the number of outbreaks 
associated with unpasteurized dairy products has increased. 
In parallel with this increase, an easing of regulations has 
facilitated greater access of consumers to unpasteurized milk 
(e.g., through farm sales or cow share programs). The num-
ber of states where the sale of unpasteurized milk is prohib-
ited decreased to 20 in 2011 from 29 in 2004 (8–10). This 
trend toward increased availability of unpasteurized dairy 
products raises public health concerns, especially because 
raw milk consumers include children (2,4,6).
Our study aimed at estimating the outbreak-related 
disease burden associated with the consumption of fluid 
cow’s milk and cheese made from cow’s milk (herein also 
referred to as milk and cheese or dairy products) that are 
unpasteurized and contaminated with Campylobacter spp., 
Salmonella spp., Shiga toxin–producing Escherichia coli 
(STEC), and Listeria monocytogenes. We also assessed 
how hypothetical increases in unpasteurized dairy con-
sumption would affect this outbreak-related disease burden.
Methods
Data Sources
We used outbreak data from the National Outbreak Report-
ing System (NORS) (11) to estimate the incidence rates of 
illnesses and hospitalizations. NORS is a web-based plat-
form that stores data on all foodborne disease outbreaks 
reported by local, state, and territorial health departments 
in the United States that have occurred since 2009. We 
included all outbreaks that occurred during 2009–2014 
in which the confirmed etiologic agents were any of the 
4 pathogens of interest (Campylobacter spp., Salmo-
nella spp., STEC, and L. monocytogenes) and the impli-
cated food vehicle or contaminated ingredient was milk 
or cheese (Figure 1). Outbreaks associated with multiple 
products; processed dairy products other than milk and 
cheese (e.g., cream, butter, yogurt, and kefir); milk pro-
duced by species other than cows; and cheese originat-
ing from species other than cows were excluded from the 
analysis (online Technical Appendix 1, https://wwwnc. 
cdc.gov/EID/article/23/6/15-1603-Techapp1.xlsx).

 RESEARCH
In addition, outbreaks with a suspected etiology status or 
associated with a dairy product with an unknown pasteuri-
zation status were excluded. 
The stochastic model (Figure 2) was developed to es-
timate the following: the incidence rates of illness and hos-
pitalization for pasteurized and unpasteurized dairy prod-
ucts, the excess risk associated with unpasteurized milk and 
cheese consumption, and the effect potential increases in 
consumption of unpasteurized dairy products would have 
on the outbreak-related disease burden (online Techni-
cal Appendix 2 Tables 1–5, https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/EID/
article/23/6/15-1603-Techapp2.pdf). Inputs (other than 
the outbreak data) used in the stochastic model were de-
rived from readily available sources of information (online 
Technical Appendix 2). Dairy consumption estimates were 
derived from the Foodborne Active Surveillance Network 
(FoodNet) Population Survey (12).
Estimation of the Incidence of Outbreak-Related  
Illnesses and Hospitalizations
We modeled the uncertainty of the pathogen-specific and 
pasteurization status–specific incidence rates of illness and 
hospitalization (λ) in the United States per serving of dairy 
product using a conjugate gamma distribution (13). The num-
ber of hospitalizations and laboratory-confirmed cases occur-
ring during the study period (2009–2014) that were caused 
by a given pathogen after consumption of milk or cheese of 
a certain pasteurization status was obtained from the NORS 
database. For laboratory-confirmed cases, this number was ad-
justed for underreporting, under testing (only a proportion of 
suspected cases were sampled and tested), and underdiagnosis 
(based on diagnostic test sensitivity), in order to estimate ill-
nesses for 2009–2014. These pathogen-specific factors were 
assumed to be independent of the product consumed and its 
pasteurization status, and constant for the years considered. 
The analysis did not include adjustment factors for potential 
misclassification in terms of etiology or pasteurization status. 
These 2 outbreak characteristics were carefully reviewed, and 
any outbreak for which the information could not be verified 
was excluded. It was thus assumed that etiology and pasteuri-
zation status misclassifications were negligible in this analysis.
Because NORS is a passive surveillance system, the 
inherent underreporting associated with it needed to be 
accounted for. We estimated an underreporting factor by

using FoodNet data, which is an active surveillance sys-
tem assumed to include virtually all identified cases (on-
line Technical Appendix 2). First, we extrapolated the total 
number of laboratory-confirmed cases in the US popula-
tion during 2009–2013 using the incidence rates reported 
by FoodNet and considering the proportions of the US 
population included in FoodNet surveillance sites (14). 
Second, we estimated the total number of outbreak-related 
cases using the fraction of the US laboratory-confirmed 
cases that were outbreak-related (15). Third, we extracted 
the proportion of outbreak-related illnesses attributable to 
dairy (16). Fourth, we calculated the ratio of the number 
of outbreak-related, laboratory-confirmed cases linked to 
dairy consumption derived from the previously described 
calculations and the number of dairy-related, laboratory-
confirmed cases reported through NORS to use as the un-
derreporting factor in the analysis (online Technical Ap-
pendix 2). When estimating the underreporting factor, we 
assumed that the FoodNet surveillance population and re-
porting practices were representative of the entire United 
States and that the food source attribution pertaining to 
the illnesses from confirmed and suspected outbreaks (16) 
were equally relevant to laboratory-confirmed cases from 
outbreaks of confirmed status only. We used the sensitivity 
of the diagnostic tests as described in Scallan et al. (15) to 
estimate the proportion of false-negative, laboratory-con-
firmed cases from NORS (underdiagnosis factor). Finally, 
we derived the under-testing factor by using the ratio of 
laboratory-confirmed primary cases to the estimated total 
number of primary illnesses reported to NORS (17).
The annual number of servings of milk or cheese of a 
given pasteurization status was calculated as the product of 
the number of servings of milk or cheese per person for a 
certain year, the resident population in the United States for 
that year (18) and the percentage of the population of dairy 
consumers that consume milk or cheese of a particular pas-
teurization status.  The annual per capita consumption of a 
given dairy product (19) was divided by its average serving 
size (i.e., the amount of milk or cheese that is generally 
served) (7,20,21) to estimate the annual per capita number

of servings of milk and cheese. These totals were then 
summed across the years of the study period. The per capita 
consumption data (19) were assumed to include both pas-
teurized and unpasteurized dairy products. Because unpas-
teurized dairy products constitute a small percentage of the 
total consumption, this assumption (if inaccurate) would 
likely have only a small effect on results. We also hypoth-
esized that the serving sizes (7,20,21) were the same for 
pasteurized and unpasteurized dairy products.
The estimates of the proportion of dairy consumers 
that consume milk or cheese of a given pasteurization sta-
tus were derived from the FoodNet Atlas of Exposure (12). 
Answers from this FoodNet survey are provided as aggre-
gates per survey site, rather than per respondent. There-
fore, answers regarding milk and cheese consumption 
were treated as independent. In addition, we assumed that 
respondents who reported consumption of unpasteurized 
milk or cheese did not consume pasteurized milk or cheese. 
Because the information to calculate the overall proportion 
of the US population consuming any type of cheese was 
unavailable, we assumed it to be equal to the proportion of 
the population reporting consumption of any cheese sold as 
or cut from solid blocks (i.e., the type of cheese consumed 
most commonly). We further assumed the proportion of the 
US population consuming unpasteurized cheese to be equal 
to the proportion reporting exposure to any cheese made 
from unpasteurized milk in the previous 7 days.
Estimation of the Excess Risks Attributed to the  
Consumption of Unpasteurized Milk and Cheese
We estimated the additional risks for illness and hospital-
ization for consumers of unpasteurized dairy products com-
pared with consumers of pasteurized ones. We calculated 
excess risk using 1) risk difference (RD), which measures 
the absolute difference in the observed risks for illness and 
hospitalization between consumers of unpasteurized dairy 
products and consumers of pasteurized ones, and 2) inci-
dence rate ratio (IRR), which provides a relative compari-
son of the risks for illness and hospitalization between the 
2 exposure groups (22).
Effects of Hypothetical Changes in Consumption of 
Unpasteurized Milk or Cheese
We assessed the potential public health effects of hypothet-
ical changes in unpasteurized milk consumption. We deter-
mined the number of illnesses in 2015 in the United States 
using the pathogen-specific rates of illnesses and hospital-
izations per serving of dairy product. The number of hospi-
talizations was calculated as pathogen-specific fractions of 
these illnesses. The pathogen-specific probabilities of hos-
pitalization in cases of illness were assumed unconditional 
on the pasteurization status of the dairy product involved, 
but rather dependent on the severity of illness (23,24).
We estimated the additional illnesses and the additional 
hospitalizations for each pathogen if a hypothetical increase 
in consumption of unpasteurized milk or cheese occurred 
using 1) the change in the proportion of the population 
consuming unpasteurized milk or cheese, 2) the number of 
servings of milk or cheese for 2015, and 3) the risk differ-
ence in illnesses per serving of dairy for that pathogen. We 
assumed that the overall proportion of the US population 
consuming milk or cheese did not change; therefore, the 
increase in the proportion of the US population consum-
ing unpasteurized milk or cheese corresponded to a shift 
of dairy consumers from pasteurized to unpasteurized. Six 
hypothetical scenarios were considered: 10%, 20%, 50%, 
100%, 200%, and 500% increases in the proportion of the 
US population consuming unpasteurized milk or cheese.
Scenario and Sensitivity Analyses
We performed a sensitivity analysis to identify the param-
eters that most influenced our estimates. The sensitivity of 
the estimates to the input parameter uncertainties was cal-
culated by using conditional means as implemented in @
RISK 6.1.2 (Palisade Corporation, Ithaca, NY, USA). In 
addition, we assessed the robustness of our sensitivity anal-
ysis with a scenario analysis in which we calculated our 
estimates with different sets of outbreak data. For the main 
analysis, the model was run on outbreaks of confirmed 
etiology and pasteurization status. In the scenario analy-
sis, the model was then re-run with either of the 2 follow-
ing sets of outbreaks added to the main data set: outbreaks 
of suspected etiology status (17) and outbreaks involving 
dairy products of unspecified pasteurization status assumed 
to be caused by pasteurized dairy products.
Model Implementation
The model was developed in Excel 2010 (Microsoft Corpo-
ration, Redmond, WA, USA) with the Monte-Carlo simu-
lation add-in @RISK 6.1.2. Results are expressed as means 
and 95% credibility intervals (CrIs, a Bayesian equivalent 
to the confidence interval) or prediction intervals (PIs, 
which provides uncertainty bounds for predictions), unless 
stated otherwise.
Results
Incidence Rates and Increased Risks Associated with 
the Consumption of Unpasteurized Milk and Cheese
We used a total of 87 outbreaks causing 750 laboratory-
confirmed illnesses and 215 hospitalizations in this analysis 
(Table 1). The incidence rates of STEC, Salmonella spp., 
and Campylobacter spp. illnesses and hospitalizations per 1 
billion servings were higher for unpasteurized dairy product 
consumers than for pasteurized dairy product consumers. 
Illnesses and hospitalizations caused by L. monocytogenes

 Disease Burden and Unpasteurized Milk and Cheese
infections were more often attributed to the consumption of 
pasteurized cheese than unpasteurized cheese (Table 2). As-
suming no change in the consumption of unpasteurized dairy, 
dairy products contaminated with STEC, Salmonella spp., L. 
monocytogenes, and Campylobacter spp. were predicted to 
cause 761 (95% PI 598–994) outbreak-related illnesses and 
22 (PI 13–32) hospitalizations in 2015. Unpasteurized dairy 
products caused 96% (PI 94%–98%) of these illnesses.
We calculated the excess risk attributable to the con-
sumption of unpasteurized milk and cheese (Table 2; Figure 
3). Because no reported illnesses were caused by Salmonella 
spp. and STEC during 2009–2014 and no hospitalizations 
were caused by Campylobacter spp., the corresponding in-
cidence rates were extremely low (Table 2). Therefore, only 
RDs (and not IRRs) were reported for these pathogens. If 
all milk and cheese consumed were pasteurized, an average 
of 732 (95% PI 570–966) illnesses and 21 (95% PI 12–32) 
hospitalizations would be prevented per year in the United 
States. Of these prevented cases, 54% would be salmonello-
sis and 43% campylobacteriosis. The mean IRR of illnesses 
was 838.8 (95% CrI 611.0–1,158.0) overall from all 4 patho-
gens of interest (Figure 3), with 0.4 (95% CrI 0–1.2) from 
L. monocytogenes and 7,601 (95% CrI 3,711–15,346) from 
Campylobacter spp. The rate of hospitalization was higher 
for unpasteurized dairy consumers than for pasteurized dairy 
consumers (mean IRR 45.1, 95% CrI 33.7–59.2), with an 
IRR of 0.5 (95% CrI 0–1.7) for L. monocytogenes.
Effects of Hypothetical Scenarios
If the percentage of unpasteurized milk consumers in the 
United States were to increase to 3.8% and unpasteurized 
cheese consumers to 1.9% (i.e., an increase of 20%), the 
number of illnesses per year would increase by an aver-
age of 19% and the number of hospitalizations by 21%. If 
the percentages of unpasteurized milk and cheese consum-
ers were to double, the number of illnesses would increase 
by an average of 96%, and the number of hospitalizations 
would increase by 104%, resulting in an additional 733 
(95% PI 571–966) illnesses/year and 22 (95% PI 13–32) 
hospitalizations/year, which corresponds to a total of 1,493 
(95% PI 1,180–1,955) illnesses/year (Figure 4), most 
caused by Salmonella spp. and Campylobacter spp.
Scenario and Sensitivity Analyses

ports the change in the output mean if the input variable 
is set to its 5th and 95th percentiles while other inputs are

consumption of unpasteurized milk and cheese were most 
sensitive to the underreporting factors (γ) for Salmonella 
spp. (mean range λ 34.9–72.5), Campylobacter spp. (mean 
range λ 33.1–45.3), and STEC (mean range λ 3.1–4.1), and 
at a secondary level to the undertesting (ρ) and underdi-
agnosis (μ) factors (results not shown). The overall IRR 
of illnesses was most sensitive to the underreporting factor 
for Salmonella spp. (mean range IRR 710.1–1,049.6). The 
number of illnesses per year caused by the consumption of 
milk or cheese was most sensitive to the rates of illnesses 
caused by Salmonella spp. and Campylobacter spp., as the 
main uncertainties apply to the incidence calculations for 
all pathogens (results not shown). Including the 9 outbreaks 
with a suspected-etiology status or the outbreak of unspeci-
fied pasteurization status (Figure 1) into the main analysis 
did not change the IRRs or the predicted number of illness-
es or hospitalizations per year (results not shown). 
Discussion
Unpasteurized dairy products are responsible for almost 
all of the 761 illnesses and 22 hospitalizations in the 
United States that occur annually because of dairy-related 
outbreaks caused by STEC, Salmonella spp., L. mono-
cytogenes, and Campylobacter spp. More than 95% of 
these illnesses are salmonellosis and campylobacteriosis. 
Consumers of unpasteurized milk and cheese are a small 
proportion of the US population (3.2% and 1.6%, respec-
tively), but compared with consumers of pasteurized dairy 
products, they are 838.8 times more likely to experience 
an illness and 45.1 times more likely to be hospitalized. 
Illnesses caused by L. monocytogenes, however, were 
found to be more often associated with the consumption of 
 
pasteurized cheese, albeit only causing 1 additional out-
break-related illness per year on average.
An easing of regulations has allowed greater access to 
unpasteurized milk in recent years (8–10), and this study 
shows that illnesses and hospitalizations will rise as con-
sumption of unpasteurized dairy products increases. If such 
consumption were to double, the mean number of out-
break-related illnesses that occur every year would increase 
by 96%. Most unpasteurized dairy–related outbreaks are 
caused by pathogen contamination at the dairy farm (ver-
sus postpasteurization contamination for pasteurized prod-
ucts) (3); thus, one could assume that decreasing pathogen 
prevalence in bulk milk tanks on raw milk farms would 
help reduce illnesses. STEC has been found in 2.5% (95% 
CrI 0.1%–9.1%), Salmonella spp. in 4.6% (3.7%–5.6%), L. 
monocytogenes in 2.5% (0.1%–9.0%), and Campylobacter 
spp. in 4.7% (2.8%–7.0%) of bulk milk tanks on US raw 
milk farms (25–29). Given these low prevalences, strate-
gies for further reduction are limited and involve multiple 
aspects of unpasteurized milk production (30). Boiling 
of milk before consumption seems to be a more realistic 
mitigation strategy, but this practice is unlikely to be imple-
mented by unpasteurized dairy product advocates because 
it would affect the perceived benefits.
This study focused on the outbreak-related illnesses, 
which is only a fraction of all dairy-related illnesses in 
the United States. Two studies have documented the frac-
tion of outbreak-related cases among FoodNet laboratory-
confirmed cases (15,31); the fraction ranges from 0.5% for 
Campylobacter spp. to 19.0% for STEC according to Ebel 
et al. (31). These data suggest that the number of sporad-
ic illnesses caused by contaminated dairy products in the 
United States might be much larger than that for outbreak-
related illnesses. However, because of the lack of infor-
mation on the characteristics of sporadic illnesses (such 
as food source attribution), we restricted the scope of this 
analysis to outbreak-related disease burden.
Our analysis relied on outbreak data from NORS (11), 
which is a passive reporting system affected by underreport-
ing. We used dairy-related outbreak cases from FoodNet 
(14–16) as a comparison to estimate underreporting; there-
fore, any potential bias of this comparison was carried over 
to our estimation of outbreak-related illnesses. By extrapo-
lating incidence rates of cases from the FoodNet catchment 
areas to the overall United States, we assumed that the 
FoodNet surveillance population and reporting practices 
were representative of the entire United States. However, 
the FoodNet catchment population represents only 15% of 
the US population from 10 nonrandom sites. Also, a recent 
study (31) suggested state-to-state variations in reporting 
practices; these variations might be even greater between 
FoodNet and non-FoodNet states. This difference might 
influence state-specific incidence rates or underreporting

consumption of pasteurized and unpasteurized milk and cheese, 
United States, 2009–2014. Markers indicate mean log IRR of 
outbreak-related illnesses and hospitalizations caused by the 
food pathogens Campylobacter spp., Listeria monocytogenes, 
Salmonella spp., and Shiga toxin–producing Escherichia coli 
per 1 billion servings of unpasteurized milk or cheese relative to 
pasteurized products. Error bars indicate 95% credibility interval 
(CrI). Numbers above markers and bars are the IRR (not in 
log scale) and 95% CrI. log (IRR) = 0 indicates no difference in 
incidence rates between unpasteurized and pasteurized milk and 
cheese. IRR, incidence rate ratio.
 Disease Burden and Unpasteurized Milk and Cheese
ratios, as well as other characteristics of the reported cas-
es. For example, if a state reported the incriminated food 
source as the food item (e.g., homemade yogurt), it would 
not have been selected for inclusion in this analysis, but if 
they reported the ingredient used for preparation (e.g., in 
the case of homemade yogurt, fluid milk), it would have 
been included in our analysis. However, the size and direc-
tion of such biases and uncertainties associated with these 
complex surveillance systems (NORS and FoodNet) are 
difficult to quantify because of the paucity of data.
The rates of illnesses were most sensitive to the estimat-
ed underreporting factors, which were assumed to be associ-
ated with the severity of symptoms (23,24) and other factors, 
such as state health department resources, and thus indepen-
dent of the pasteurization status. Also, because this analysis 
only considered outbreaks involving milk and cheese (and no 
other dairy products), we are probably underestimating the 
incidence of illnesses and hospitalizations. However, milk 
and cheese are the most commonly consumed dairy sourc-
es and cause the most outbreaks (milk and cheese caused 
99% of dairy-related outbreaks reported to NORS during the 
study period), so the underestimation is likely limited. None-
theless, the overall comparison of risk between consumers of 
pasteurized and unpasteurized products should remain valid.
Estimates of the proportion of the population consum-
ing dairy products were derived from the FoodNet popula-
tion survey (12). We assumed that respondents who reported 
consumption of unpasteurized milk or cheese were not con-
suming pasteurized dairy. However, if unpasteurized milk 
or cheese only represented a fraction of their dairy con-
sumption, the number of servings of unpasteurized dairy 
products could have been overestimated, and thus the risk 
for consumers of unpasteurized dairy products might have 
been underestimated. Also, the FoodNet population survey 
is based on a relatively small convenience sample and might 
therefore not be accurate. For example, the self-reported es-
timates of consumption of unpasteurized milk and cheese 
(3.2% and 1.6%, respectively) (12) might be underestimates 
or overestimates, potentially caused by consumers confus-
ing the terms raw, organic, and natural (or other reasons). In 
addition, consumption might have changed since the 2007 
FoodNet population survey (12), which might have resulted 
in an under- or overestimation of the risk from unpasteurized 
milk products. However, because the proportion of dairy 
consumers using unpasteurized products remains small, and 
the IRRs are very large, this overestimation is likely limited, 
and the trend for additional illnesses as unpasteurized dairy 
consumption grows remains valid. Similarly, estimates of 
the consumption of pasteurized cheese are underestimates: 
data available only provide estimates of the highest expo-
sure to a single type of cheese, rather than to any type of 
cheese (12), potentially resulting in a risk overestimation for 
consumers of pasteurized dairy products. This is a limita-
tion, notably for outbreaks linked to queso fresco and other 
Mexican-style soft cheeses. Despite these limitations, to the 
authors’ knowledge, this study is based on the best avail-
able data and builds upon other well accepted risk attribution 
methods (15,16,32).
In conclusion, outbreaks linked to the consumption of 
cow’s milk and cheese were estimated to cause on average 
761 illnesses and 22 hospitalizations per year in the United 
States. Unpasteurized products are consumed by a small 
percentage of the US dairy consumers but cause 95% of 
illnesses; the risk for illness was found to be >800 times 
higher for consumers of unpasteurized milk or cheese than 
for consumers of pasteurized dairy products. Therefore, 
outbreak-related illnesses will increase steadily as unpas-
teurized dairy consumption grows, likely driven largely by 
salmonellosis and campylobacteriosis.

Figure 4. Number of dairy-related outbreak illnesses predicted per 
year in the United States if unpasteurized cow’s milk and cheese 
consumption increases 0%, 10%, 20%, 50%, 100%, 200%, and 
500%. Numbers in parentheses indicate percentage of total 
population consuming unpasteurized cow’s milk. The illnesses 
graphed are those from outbreaks associated with cow’s milk or 
cheese contaminated with Shiga toxin–producing Escherichia coli, 
Salmonella spp., Listeria monocytogenes, and Campylobacter 
spp. Markers indicate means; bars indicate 95% prediction 
intervals. The consumption estimates were based on the year 
2015, and a 0% increase corresponds to the current proportion of 
the US population consuming unpasteurized dairy products.
