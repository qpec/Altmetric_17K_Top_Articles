Opioid tolerance and the potential for addiction is a significant burden associated with pain management, yet its precise underlying
mechanism and prevention remain elusive. Immune signaling contributes to the decreased efficacy of opioids, and we recently
demonstrated that Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-mediated neuroinflammation in the periaqueductal gray (PAG) drives tolerance. Tumor
necrosis factor (TNF), a product of TLR4 signaling, promotes inflammation and facilitates glutamatergic signaling, key components of opioid
tolerance. Therefore, we hypothesize that TLR4-mediated opioid tolerance requires TNF signaling. By expression of a dominant-negative
TNF peptide via lentiviral vector injection in rat PAG to sequester soluble TNF (solTNF), we demonstrate that solTNF mediates morphine
tolerance induced by TLR4 signaling, stimulates neuroinflammation (increased IL-1β and TLR4 mRNA), and disrupts glutamate reuptake
(decreased GLT-1 and GLAST mRNA). We further demonstrate the efficacy of the brain-permeant PEGylated version of the anti-solTNF
peptide, XPro1595, injected systemically, to normalize morphine-induced CNS neuroinflammation and morphine- and endotoxin-induced
changes in glutamate transport, effectively preserving the efficacy of morphine analgesia and eliminating tolerance. Our findings provide a
novel pharmacological target for the prevention of opioid-induced immune signaling, tolerance, and addiction.

INTRODUCTION
Opioid therapy remains a common strategy for severe and
chronic pain management with 3–4% of adults in the United
States receiving long-term opioid therapy (Dowell et al,
2016). However, decreased analgesic efficacy over time (ie,
tolerance) significantly impedes treatment for ~ 60% of the
patient population (Gulur et al, 2014). Long-term opioid
therapy is associated with increased risk of abuse, depen-
dence, and dose-related fatal overdose (Dowell et al, 2016).
Immune signaling is a significant contributor to the negative
consequences of opioid therapy including tolerance, hyper-
algesia, addiction, dependence, and withdrawal (Hutchinson
et al, 2007), and has been implicated as a driving factor in a
variety of chronic pain syndromes, including rheumatoid
arthritis (RA) and fibromyalgia (Heo et al, 2011; Kosek et al,
2015). Understanding the mechanisms underlying opioid-
induced neuroinflammation is paramount to developing
effective pain management strategies that minimize the risk
of dependence, abuse, and long-term consequences of
chronic neuroinflammation.
We recently demonstrated that chronic opioid adminis-
tration in rats induces a robust neuroinflammatory response
via Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling in the periaqueductal
gray (PAG), a key site for opioid-mediated analgesia, which
drives tolerance (Wang et al, 2012; Eidson and Murphy,
2013). However, the mechanism by which TLR4 signaling
leads to opioid tolerance is unknown. Morphine-induced
TLR4 signaling increases proinflammatory cytokine produc-
tion in the central nervous system (CNS) (Raghavendra et al,
2002; Shen et al, 2011a) including tumor necrosis factor
(TNF). Here we test the hypothesis that TNF signaling is
required for TLR4-induced tolerance.
TNF drives the release of itself and other proinflammatory
cytokines (eg, IL-1β and IL-6) (Shen et al, 2011a, b; Sun et al,
2012),
and
robustly
alters
glutamate
homeostasis
and
excitatory signaling in the CNS (Stellwagen et al, 2005).
Interestingly, many proposed mechanisms of opioid toler-
ance and dependence include a role for increased glutama-
tergic and/or decreased GABAergic signaling (Vaughan et al,
1997; Bachtell et al, 2015), which ultimately oppose the
hyperpolarizing effects of morphine. TNF naturally exists in
two forms: the more common form, transmembrane TNF
(tmTNF), and the less abundant form, soluble TNF (solTNF)
(Kriegler et al, 1988). Although spinal TNF has been impli-

 cated in opioid tolerance maintenance (Shen et al, 2011a),
TNF has not been examined in isolation in the development
of opioid tolerance, and it is not known which form of
TNF mediates tolerance development and glutamatergic
signaling.
The present studies tested the hypothesis that TLR4 elicits
opioid tolerance via solTNF-mediated increases in PAG
immune signaling and disruption of glutamate reuptake. To
test this hypothesis, we manipulated PAG solTNF using a
lentivirus encoding dominant-negative TNF (DN-TNF) or
XPro1595, a PEGylated brain-permeant peptide, to sequester
solTNF and examined the impact on tolerance, cytokine
expression, and key elements of glutamate homeostasis. Our
results demonstrate for the first time that the solTNF (and
not
tmTNF)
increases
cytokine
expression
and
alters
glutamate homeostasis within the PAG, providing a potential
mechanism driving the development of opioid tolerance.
Taken together, these results suggest a novel pharmacological
target to enhance the efficacy of opioid analgesia in the clinic
while minimizing the risk of dependence and addiction.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Subjects
Male Sprague–Dawley rats (250–350 g; Charles River, MA)
were pair-housed on a 12:12 hour light–dark cycle (lights on
at 0700 hours) with ad libitum access to food and water. The
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Georgia
State University approved all studies.
Lentiviral DN-TNF
The human full-length DN-TNF DNA sequence (TNF
variant with two point mutations; A145R/I97T; Steed et al,
2003) and the enhanced green fluorescent protein DNA
sequence (green fluorescent protein (GFP); reporter) were
subcloned into a lentiviral vector under the control of
the chicken β-actin cytomegalovirus (CAG) promoter as
published previously (McCoy et al, 2008). Details of lentiviral
production and analysis of expression following behavioral
testing are described in Supplementary Information.
Lentivirus Infection and Morphine Treatment
Bilateral intra-ventrolateral PAG (vlPAG) infusion of lenti-
DN-TNF or lenti-GFP were performed as described in
Supplementary Information. After 1 week, morphine (5 mg/
kg, subcutaneously; National Institute on Drug Abuse,
Bethesda, MD) or vehicle (saline; 1 ml/kg, subcutaneously)
was administered once a day for 3 consecutive days, resulting
in four groups: lenti-DN-TNF+Morphine (n = 10), lenti-DN-
TNF+Saline
(n = 5),
lenti-GFP+Morphine
(n = 10),
and
lenti-GFP+Saline (n = 4).
Cannulation, Lentivirus Infection, and LPS
Microinfusions
Rats were implanted with bilateral cannula aimed at the
vlPAG and received bilateral infusions of lenti-DN-TNF or
lenti-GFP while under surgical anesthesia as described in the
Supplementary Information. One week following viral vector
infusion, cannulated rats received daily bilateral intra-vlPAG
lipopolysaccharide or saline for 3 days to induce a naïve
morphine tolerance, resulting in the following groups: lenti-
DN-TNF+PAG LPS (n = 9), lenti-DN-TNF+PAG Saline
(n = 6), lenti-GFP+PAG LPS (n = 4), and lenti-GFP+PAG
Saline (n = 6). See Supplementary Information for details.
XPro1595 and Morphine Treatment
XPro1595 (10 mg/kg; subcutaneously), a brain permeant
TNF variant that selectively inhibits solTNF signaling
(42500-fold) (Steed et al, 2003; Zalevsky et al, 2007), or
saline was administered 1 day before the first morphine
(5 mg/kg; subcutaneously) injection and with the final (third)
morphine injection (half-life = 18 h), resulting in the follow-
ing groups: XPro+Morphine (n = 11), XPro+Saline (n = 8),
Vehicle+Morphine (n = 11), and Vehicle+Saline (n = 8).
Behavioral Testing
Nociception (paw withdrawal latency) was assessed using the
paw thermal stimulator as described in detail in the
Supplementary Information (Hargreaves et al, 1988).
In Situ Hybridization Analysis of the Astrocytic
Glutamate Transporters GLAST and GLT-1, and the
Neuronal Excitatory Amino-Acid Carrier EAAC1
In a subset of rats (n =4–6 per group), in situ hybridization for
GLAST, GLT-1, and the neuronal excitatory amino acid carrier
1 (EAAC1) mRNA was performed using
35S-UTP-labeled
RNA probes generated from cloned fragments of cDNA
derived from rat brain tissue as described previously (Inoue
et
al,
2004).
Details

provided
in
Supplementary
Information. Changes in mRNA were assessed using ANOVA,
and Fisher’s post hoc tests when a significant main effect was
observed (SPSS). Mean specific hybridization is reported as the
disintegrations per minute per milligram of tissue (dpm/
mg) ± S.E.M.; po0.05 was considered significant.
XPro1595 Measurement
Immediately following tolerance assessment, cerebrospinal
fluid (CSF) was collected via cisterna magna, and plasma and
brains were collected (in under 2 min). Midbrain, CSF, and
plasma
XPro1595
was
quantified
as
described
in
Supplementary Information.
qPCR Analysis of Proinflammatory Cytokines and TLR4
mRNA
Brains were collected from rats (n = 5 per group treated with
XPro+Morphine, XPro+Saline, Vehicle+Morphine, and Vehi-
cle+Saline, blocked (bregma − 6.96 to − 8.52), and 1 mm
bilateral micropunches were taken through the vlPAG for
quantitative RT-PCR of proinflammatory cytokines and TLR4
mRNA as described in Supplementary Information.
Gene expression is reported as the ratio of the gene of
interest to Gapdh, and is normalized to the Vehicle+Saline
condition. Changes in mRNA between groups were assessed
using an ANOVA on ranks (Kruskal–Wallis), and Mann–
Whitney U-test post hoc comparisons (SPSS). Data are
expressed as median; po0.05 was considered significant.

 RESULTS
Sequestration of vlPAG SolTNF Eliminated Tolerance to
Systemic Morphine
Our initial series of experiments determined if sequestration
of solTNF attenuated the development of tolerance to
systemic morphine. The DN-TNF rapidly forms hetero-
trimers with native solTNF, effectively sequestering endo-
genous solTNF and inhibiting TNF receptor 1 (TNFRI)
binding (Steed et al, 2003), while sparing tmTNF signaling
(Steed et al, 2003; Zalevsky et al, 2007). Human DN-TNF
and GFP or GFP alone was bilaterally expressed in the vlPAG
of adult male rats via lentiviral infection 7 days before
systemic morphine (5 mg/kg; ED50 dose; Loyd et al, 2008) or
saline (1 ml/kg), once daily for 3 consecutive days to induce
tolerance.
Robust virus-induced GFP expression (Figure 1a) was
observed bilaterally in the vlPAG as indicated by fluorescein
isothiocyanate (FITC) microscopy (Figure 1c). Baseline and
postinjection
paw
withdrawal
latencies
did
not
differ
between lenti-DN-TNF and lenti-GFP rats treated with
systemic saline, indicating that DN-TNF expression did not
alter basal nociceptive thresholds (Figure 1b, black symbols).
Administration of morphine on Days 1 and 3 produced an
increase in both lenti-DN-TNF-treated rats and lenti-GFP
controls (red symbols). Two-way ANOVA revealed
a
significant interaction between solTNF sequestration and
morphine efficacy across time, F(9, 54) = 23.51; po0.0001.
Morphine
efficacy
did
not
differ
between
lenti-DN-
TNF+Morphine and lenti-GFP+Morphine groups on Day 1
(first morphine injection; p40.05). On Day 3, morphine was
significantly more efficacious in lenti-DN-TNF+Morphine-
treated rats compared with that in lenti-GFP+Morphine-
treated rats (third morphine injection; po0.0001) indicative
of tolerance only in the lenti-GFP+Morphine group.
Administration of cumulative doses of morphine on Day 4
produced an increase in paw withdrawal latency in all rats
tested (Figure 1d; F(3,
195) = 49.64, po0.0001). Post hoc
analysis revealed that lenti-GFP+Morphine-treated rats were
tolerant to morphine, as indicated by a threefold rightward
shift in the dose–response curve (ED50 = 7.47 mg/kg, as
compared with lenti-GFP+Saline controls, ED50 = 2.50 mg/kg;
p = 0.01; Supplementary Table 1). Intra-vlPAG pretreatment
with lenti-DN-TNF preserved the antinociceptive potency
of
morphine
(ED50 = 2.66 mg/kg)
compared
with
rats
made tolerant to morphine (lenti-DN-TNF+Morphine vs
lenti-GFP+Morphine;
p = 0.01).
Indeed,
lenti-DN-TNF
+Morphine-treated rats did not differ from rats who received
saline before the morphine challenge (p = 0.15).
Sequestration of vlPAG SolTNF Eliminated Morphine
Tolerance Induced by vlPAG LPS
To test our hypothesis that morphine acts through TLR4 to
increase solTNF signaling and decrease morphine efficacy,
we repeated the above experiment in rats that received intra-
vlPAG infusions of the prototypical TLR4 agonist LPS
for 3 days to induce a naïve tolerance to morphine. Robust

TLR4 mediates morphine tolerance via soluble TNF

Neuropsychopharmacology
 virus-induced GFP expression was observed bilaterally in the
vlPAG (Figure 1e). Consistent with our previous study
(Eidson and Murphy, 2013), intra-PAG administration of
LPS had no effect on baseline paw withdrawal latencies when
measured 24 and 72 h later (data not shown). Administration
of cumulative doses of morphine on Day 4 (first morphine
exposure) produced an increase in paw withdrawal latency in
all rats tested (Figure 1f; significant main effect of treatment:
F(3,167) = 37.31, po0.001). Three intra-vlPAG infusions of
LPS was sufficient to induce ‘naïve’ tolerance to morphine, as
indicated by a rightward shift in the morphine dose–
response curve (lenti-GFP+PAG LPS, ED50 = 6.00 mg/kg)
as
compared
with
lenti-GFP+PAG
Saline
controls
(ED50 = 2.37 mg/kg;
p = 0.02;
Supplementary
Table
1).
Intra-vlPAG pretreatment with lenti-DN-TNF preserved
the antinociceptive potency of morphine (lenti-DN-TNF
+PAG LPS, ED50 = 3.26 mg/kg) compared with rats made
tolerant to morphine by vlPAG LPS (lenti-GFP+PAG LPS;
p = 0.01). Indeed, lenti-DN-TNF+PAG LPS rats did not
differ from lenti-DN-TNF+PAG Saline controls (p = 0.07).
These results demonstrate that LPS mimics the effects of
morphine, acting through TLR4 to increase solTNF signaling
and decrease morphine efficacy (ie, induce tolerance).
Chronic Systemic Morphine Decreased vlPAG GLT-1 and
GLAST mRNA in a solTNF-Dependent Manner
We next tested the hypothesis that solTNF contributes to
tolerance development by decreasing
astrocytic GLT-1
and GLAST, the primary source of glutamate reuptake in
the brain (60–80%; Rothstein et al, 1996); changes in the
neuronal glutamate transporter EAAC1 were also investi-
gated. mRNA in the caudal vlPAG of rats treated with
lenti-GFP+Morphine, lenti-DN-TNF+Morphine, lenti-GFP+
Saline, and lenti-DN-TNF+Saline were determined using
in situ hybridization. Morphine administration for 3 days
significantly decreased vlPAG GLT-1 mRNA, as com-
pared with saline controls (main effect of treatment:
F(3,23) = 3.58, p = 0.03; lenti-GFP+Morphine vs lenti-GFP
+Saline; p = 0.004; Figure 2a). Lentiviral expression of DN-
TNF in the vlPAG rescued the expression of GLT-1 mRNA,
such that lenti-DN-TNF+Morphine rats did not differ
from lenti-GFP+Saline controls (p = 0.13). Similar to what
was noted for GLT-1 mRNA, chronic morphine significantly
decreased vlPAG GLAST mRNA as compared with saline
controls (main effect of treatment: (F(3,26) = 6.681, p = 0.002;
lenti-GFP+Morphine
vs
lenti-GFP+Saline;
po0.001;
Figure 2c). vlPAG DN-TNF expression prevented morphine-
induced decrease in vlPAG GLAST mRNA, as lenti-DN-TNF
+Morphine rats did not differ from lenti-GFP+Saline
controls (p = 0.49). No significant effect of treatment was
noted in vlPAG EAAC1 mRNA expression (F(3,26) = 0.876,
p = 0.47; Figure 2e), suggesting that morphine preferentially
alters astrocytic, and not neuronal, glutamate transport in
the vlPAG.
Chronic vlPAG TLR4 Agonism Decreased vlPAG GLT-1
and GLAST mRNA in a solTNF-Dependent Manner
Given that LPS binding to TLR4 is a potent inducer of TNF
expression, we hypothesized that GLT-1 and GLAST would
be decreased in rats made tolerant to morphine by LPS
(naïve tolerance). Consistent with our results from chronic
systemic morphine exposure, chronic vlPAG microinfusions
of LPS decreased
vlPAG GLT-1 and GLAST mRNA
(F(3,12) = 7.268, p = 0.01 and F(3,10) = 7.321, p = 0.01, respec-
tively), and did not alter vlPAG EAAC1 mRNA (F(3,10) =
1.982, p = 0.17; Figure 2b, d, and f). Lenti-GFP+PAG LPS rats
had significant decreases in GLT-1 and GLAST mRNA as
compared
with
lenti-GFP+PAG
Saline
rats
(p = 0.005
(Figures 2b) and p = 0.002 (Figure 2d), respectively). vlPAG
DN-TNF expression rescued GLT-1 mRNA (lenti-DN-TNF
+PAG
LPS
vs
lenti-GFP+PAG
Saline;
p = 0.72),
and
increased, but did not rescue, GLAST mRNA (lenti-DN-
TNF+PAG LPS vs lenti-GFP+PAG Saline; p = 0.04).
Systemic Administration of the SolTNF Inhibitor
XPro1595 Prevented Morphine Tolerance
We next tested the effect of systemic XPro1595 on morphine
tolerance using the same paradigm as above. XPro1595
(10 mg/kg;
subcutaneously)
or
vehicle
(saline;
1 ml/kg;
subcutaneously) was administered 1 day before the first
morphine/saline injection, and with the third morphine/
saline injection. Two-way ANOVA revealed a significant
interaction between solTNF sequestration and morphine
efficacy across time, F(9, 42) = 14.15; po0.0001 (Figure 3a).
Morphine efficacy did not differ between rats treated with
XPro1595+Morphine and those treated with Vehicle+Mor-
phine on Day 1 (first morphine injection; p40.05). On Day
3, morphine was significantly more efficacious in XPro1595
+Morphine-treated rats compared with that in Vehicle
+Morphine-treated rats (po0.001). Administration of cu-
mulative doses of morphine on Day 4 produced an increase
in nociceptive thresholds in all rats tested (Figure 3b;
F(3,258) = 87.31, po0.0001). Vehicle+Morphine-treated rats
were tolerant to morphine (ED50 = 8.03 mg/kg), in compar-
ison with Vehicle+Saline rats (ED50 = 2.31 mg/kg; po0.001).
Systemic pretreatment with XPro1595 preserved the anti-
nociceptive potency of morphine (XPro+Morphine; ED50 =
3.08 mg/kg) compared with vehicle-treated rats that were
tolerant to morphine (Vehicle+Morphine; po0.001). An
ELISA for human TNF (hTNF) revealed robust XPro1595
levels in plasma, CSF, and midbrain tissue (Supplementary
Figure 1). Indeed, midbrain levels strongly correlated with
CSF levels of hTNF (R2 = 0.87), indicating efficient transport
into the brain. hTNF was not detected in Vehicle+Morphine-
or Vehicle+Saline-treated rats (data not shown).
Systemic Administration of XPro1595 Abolished
Morphine-Induced Increases in vlPAG TLR4 and IL-1β
mRNA
TNF and TLR4 are major regulators of cytokine expression
in the CNS (eg, IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF), and cytokines,
including IL-1β and IL-6, have been implicated in morphine
tolerance. We tested the hypothesis that chronic morphine
increases proinflammatory cytokine expression in the vlPAG
in a solTNF-dependent manner. Changes in vlPAG TLR4
mRNA were also assayed. qPCR revealed that morphine
significantly increased vlPAG TLR4 expression (H = 7.49,
2 d.f., p = 0.02; Figure 4a), such that TLR4 gene expression
significantly increased in Vehicle+Morphine-treated rats as
compared with XPro+Saline controls (W = 15; p = 0.02).

treatment was also observed for vlPAG IL-1β mRNA by
3500% (Kruskal–Wallis, H = 8.05, 2 d.f., p = 0.02; Figure 4b)
as compared with Vehicle+Saline controls, a nearly 30-fold

 (W = 26; p = 0.84). The increase in TNF gene expression was
not statistically significant (Kruskal–Wallis, H = 4.00, 2 d.f.,
p = 0.14). No significant change in IL-6 or IL-10 mRNA
was noted.
DISCUSSION
TLR4 Signaling Contributes to the Adverse
Consequences of Chronic Opioid Use
Chronic morphine administration leads to the induction of a
neuroinflammatory response (Eidson and Murphy, 2013),
resulting in a significant increase in glutamatergic tone and
excitatory neurotransmission (Fine et al, 1996; Ogoshi et al,
2005), which together actively oppose the analgesic effect of
morphine (Trujillo and Akil, 1991; Wong et al, 2002). These
same characteristics underlie opioid dependence, with-
drawal, and addiction, implicating a common underlying
mechanism (Hutchinson et al, 2007). We recently demon-
strated that PAG TLR4 is necessary for the development of
morphine tolerance, and there is a growing body of literature
implicating TLR4 in opioid reward and reinforcement
(Bachtell et al, 2015). TLR4 binds opioids, including mor-
phine, resulting in the production of a milieu of proin-
flammatory signaling factors (eg, TNF and IL-1β; Wang et al,
2012) that increase inflammation, and ultimately increase
neuroexcitation (Stellwagen et al, 2005). There has been no
attempt to isolate the signal downstream of TLR4 that is
responsible for the adverse effects of opioids.
solTNF is a Key Proinflammatory Product of TLR4
Signaling
The present set of experiments tested the hypothesis that
TLR4 contributes to morphine tolerance via modulation of
inflammatory signaling and glutamate homeostasis in a
solTNF-dependent manner. TNF is a type 1 transmembrane
protein that naturally exists in two forms: the more common
form, tmTNF, and the less abundant form, solTNF, which is
formed after cleavage of tmTNF by ADAM17/TNF-α
Converting Enzyme (TACE) (Kriegler et al, 1988). solTNF
signals primarily through TNFRI, whereas tmTNF signals
through both TNFRI and TNFRII. As TNFRII signaling is
protective against glutamate excitotoxicity (Marchetti et al,
2004), and enhanced glutamatergic signaling contributes
to opioid tolerance, we predicted that decreasing TNFRI
signaling by selectively sequestering solTNF (while preser-
ving TNFRII signaling) would prevent tolerance to mor-
phine. Here, we manipulated PAG solTNF sequestration
using
a
lentivirus
and
brain-permeant
DN-TNF,
and
examined the impact on tolerance, cytokine release, and
key elements of glutamate homeostasis.
PAG Cytokines and TLR4 mRNA are Increased by
Chronic Morphine
In agreement with our previous findings (Eidson and
Murphy, 2013), we show that tolerance to morphine
developed rapidly. Indeed, systemic administration of one
ED50 dose of morphine for 3 days is sufficient to induce
tolerance as indicated by a threefold rightward shift in the
morphine dose–response curve. Development of morphine
tolerance is paralleled by increased gene expression of three
major proinflammatory factors in the PAG: TLR4, TNF, and
IL-1β, indicating that chronic morphine induces inflamma-
tion within the PAG and primes PAG glia to overrespond to
subsequent morphine challenges by increasing gene expres-
sion of the receptor substrate for opioid-mediated inflam-
mation (TLR4; Wang et al, 2012). Although the increase in
vlPAG TNF was not significant in the current study, and is in
contrast to what has been noted in the spinal cord (Shen
et al, 2011a), TNF is found in very low concentration in the
CNS (femtomolar to picomolar range), and binds with high
affinity to a relatively small number of receptors (Peterson
et al, 1998). In vitro, TNF protein is significantly increased by
the TLR4 agonist LPS in a TACE-dependent manner at
30 min following LPS application (von Maltzan et al, 2012).
In vivo, acute intrathecal morphine analgesia is reduced by
TNF within 5 min of morphine administration (Hutchinson
et al, 2008), suggesting that morphine leads to the quick
release of solTNF protein via TACE-mediated cleavage of
tmTNF. As TNF is primarily responsible for initiating the

 production of other proinflammatory cytokines (DeLeo et al,
2004), morphine signaling through TLR4 may induce rapid
cleavage of tmTNF to solTNF protein and stimulate the
production of IL-1β and TLR4 mRNA to modulate glutamate
homeostasis. Our findings suggest that TACE inhibition may
preserve morphine analgesia and prevent tolerance develop-
ment in the vlPAG by preventing TLR4-mediated solTNF
signaling. The PAG, along with the RVM and spinal cord,
form the descending pain modulatory circuit, and all three
regions are critical neural substrates for the analgesic effects
of morphine. In the present study, we focused on TLR4-
mediated neuroinflammation within the PAG; however,
similar neuroinflammatory spinal cord responses have been
implicated in the development of morphine tolerance
(Raghavendra et al, 2002).

morphine efficacy following chronic exposure. These data
are the first to establish a role for TNF in opiate tolerance,
and are the first to identify solTNF as a critical proin-
flammatory factor mediating opioid tolerance development.
Currently, there are FDA-approved non-selective biological
inhibitors that sequester both forms of TNF (solTNF and
tmTNF),

Morphine tolerance, induced by systemic morphine admin-
istration, decreased astrocytic (GLT-1 and GLAST), but not
neuronal (EAACI), glutamate transporter mRNA in the
vlPAG, complementing our previous findings (Eidson and
Murphy, 2013), and a vast literature demonstrating a role for
glia (Watkins et al, 2005) and excitatory neurotransmission
(McLemore et al, 1997) in morphine tolerance. Astrocytes
are responsible for the majority of glutamate uptake in the
CNS via GLT-1 and GLAST (Rothstein et al, 1996), thereby
terminating glutamatergic signaling (Kanai et al, 1993). A
significant increase in CSF glutamate and aspartate has been
reported in morphine-tolerant humans (Wong et al, 2002),
and morphine challenge increases glutamate in the CSF of
morphine-tolerant rats (Tai et al, 2006). Increased glutamate
uptake by GLT-1 attenuates morphine tolerance in mice
(Nakagawa et al, 2001). Taken together with our results,
these data suggest that a breakdown in astrocyte-mediated
glutamate homeostasis significantly contributes to opioid
tolerance. Chronic vlPAG LPS resulted in behavioral and
molecular phenotypes that paralleled morphine-treated rats,
suggesting
that
TLR4
signaling

morphine analgesia by promoting neuroinflammation and

A Proposed Inflammatory Model of Morphine Tolerance
Morphine and other opioids bind to neuronal mu opioid
receptors (MORs) (Pasternak and Pan, 2013) and elicit
analgesia, in part, by hyperpolarization of GABAergic
neurons (Basbaum and Fields, 1978; Lau and Vaughan,
2014). Indeed, opioids have a direct inhibitory effect on most
MOR-expressing neurons (Vaughan et al, 1997), including
those in the descending analgesic circuit (eg, PAG) (Vaughan
et al, 1997). Based on our current findings, we propose that
morphine binds to neuronal MOR as well as glial TLR4 in
the PAG, and that concurrent activity at these receptors
modulates the analgesic efficacy of morphine via two
opposing mechanisms: (i) opiate binding at MOR results in
hyperpolarization of GABAergic neurons and induction of
opiate analgesia; and (ii) opiate binding at glial TLR4 leads to
increased vlPAG solTNF signaling that simultaneously
promotes inflammation and disrupts the ability of astrocytes
to scavenge excess glutamate, counteracting MOR-mediated
hyperpolarization of GABAergic neurons to promote mor-
phine tolerance. Key tenants of our proposed model are
illustrated in Figure 5.
CONCLUSIONS
Our results support the use of solTNF sequestration peptides
such as XPro1595 as a potential adjunct to opioid therapy. As
tmTNF is the TNF ligand that signals through TNFRII in
physiological conditions, and TNFRII is protective against
glutamate excitotoxicity (Marchetti et al, 2004), anti-solTNF
treatment is likely to be a dually beneficial countermeasure to
the opioid-induced neuroexcitability known to contribute to
tolerance (Trujillo and Akil, 1991; McLemore et al, 1997). As
the mechanisms underlying hyperalgesia (DeLeo et al, 2004)
are strikingly similar to the mechanisms underlying opioid
tolerance development, these data suggest that selective anti-
solTNF biologics could complement opioid therapy in the
clinic by suppressing nociceptive signals at the site of injury
and in the spinal cord, as well as preserving morphine
analgesic efficacy by preventing vlPAG glia activation.
Figure 5
A schematic diagram illustrating our hypothesized model of soluble tumor necrosis factor (solTNF)-induced morphine tolerance development in
the periaqueductal gray (PAG). Based on the major conclusions of our own data and the data of others, we hypothesize that chronic morphine binds to
ventrolateral (vlPAG) Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and leads to cleavage of transmembrane TNF (tmTNF) to solTNF by TNF-converting enzyme (TACE) to
increase proinflammatory gene expression (TLR4, interleukin-1β (IL-1β)) and decrease astrocytic glutamate transporter mRNA (glutamate type I transporter
(GLT-1) and glutamate aspartate transporter (GLAST)) in the vlPAG. These changes effectively increase the availability of glutamate in the synapse, thereby
decreasing the ability of morphine to hyperpolarize GABAergic neurons. These changes associated with morphine tolerance prevent morphine from initiating
signaling through the descending analgesic circuit. A full color version of this figure is available at the Neuropsychopharmacology journal online.
