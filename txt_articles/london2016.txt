Association of Perioperative Statin Use With Mortality
and Morbidity After Major Noncardiac Surgery
Martin J. London, MD; Gregory G. Schwartz, MD, PhD; Kwan Hur, PhD; William G. Henderson, MPH, PhD
IMPORTANCE The efficacy of statins in reducing perioperative cardiovascular and other organ
system complications in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery remains controversial.
Owing to a paucity of randomized clinical trials, analyses of large databases may facilitate
informed hypothesis generation and more efficient trial design.
OBJECTIVE To evaluate associations of early perioperative statin use with outcomes in a
national cohort of veterans undergoing noncardiac surgery.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This retrospective, observational cohort analysis
included 180 478 veterans undergoing elective or emergent noncardiac surgery (including
vascular, general, neurosurgery, orthopedic, thoracic, urologic, and otolaryngologic) who
were admitted within 7 days of surgery and sampled by the Veterans Affairs Surgical Quality
Improvement Program (VASQIP). Patients were admitted to Department of Veterans Affairs
hospitals and underwent 30-day postoperative follow-up. Data were collected from October
1, 2005, to September 30, 2010, and analyzed from November 28, 2013, to October 31, 2016.
EXPOSURE Statin use on the day of or the day after surgery.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES All-cause 30-day mortality (primary outcome) and
standardized 30-day cardiovascular and noncardiovascular outcomes captured by VASQIP.
Use of statins and other perioperative cardiovascular medications was ascertained from the
Veterans Affairs Pharmacy Benefits Management research database.
RESULTS A total of 180 478 eligible patients (95.6% men and 4.4% women; mean [SD] age,
63.8 [11.6] years) underwent analysis, and 96 486 were included in the propensity
score–matched cohort (96.3% men; 3.7% women; mean [SD] age, 65.9 [10.6] years). At the
time of hospital admission, 37.8% of patients had an active outpatient prescription for a
statin, of whom 80.8% were prescribed simvastatin and 59.5% used moderate-intensity
dosing. Exposure to a statin on the day of or the day after surgery based on an inpatient
prescription was noted in 31.5% of the cohort. Among 48 243 propensity score–matched
pairs of early perioperative statin-exposed and nonexposed patients, 30-day all-cause
mortality was significantly reduced in exposed patients (relative risk, 0.82; 95% CI,
0.75-0.89; P < .001; number needed to treat, 244; 95% CI, 170-432). Of the secondary
outcomes, a significant association with reduced risk of any complication was noted (relative
risk, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.79-0.86; P < .001; number needed to treat, 67; 95% CI, 55-87); all were
significant except for the central nervous system and thrombosis categories, with the
greatest risk reduction (relative risk, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.64-0.83) for cardiac complications.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Early perioperative exposure to a statin was associated with a
significant reduction in all-cause perioperative mortality and several cardiovascular and
noncardiovascular complications. However, the potential for selection biases in these results
must be considered.

A
recent analysis of the National Health and Nutrition Ex-
amination Survey reported that as of 2012, statins were
the most commonly prescribed medication class in the
United States.1 With the release of updated national guide-
lines for cholesterol management in 2014,2 the use of statins
is expected to increase even further. Early safety concerns re-
garding perioperative statin treatment have been largely
dispelled.3,4 However, evidence for efficacy of perioperative
statin treatment in reducing adverse perioperative cardiovas-
cular and noncardiovascular outcomes remains inconclu-
sive, with most current data derived from studies in cardiac
or vascular surgery5,6 and very limited data in other catego-
ries that constitute most surgical procedures.5,7,8
Current perioperative guidelines focus primarily on con-
tinuationofexistingtherapyinlong-termstatinusers,withweak
recommendations of potential efficacy in reducing cardiovas-
cular complications.9,10 Controversy regarding the the aca-
demic integrity of several randomized clinical trials of peri-
operative statins complicate interpretation of the existing
literature.11Anearlylargeobservationalanalysis12limitedtoin-
patientbillingandadministrativedatareportedanadjustedodds

provementProgramdatabasetoevaluatetheassociationofpre-

recently, Berwanger et al,14 in a subanalysis of a multinational
cohortofpatientsundergoingnoncardiacsurgery,reportedthat
preoperative statin treatment was associated with significant
reduction in all-cause postoperative mortality, myocardial in-
jury, and stroke. However, whether statin treatment in the im-
mediate perioperative period influences the risk for complica-
tions after noncardiac surgery remains unknown. Herein, we
reportonassociationsofearlyperioperativestatinexposurewith
perioperative mortality and cardiovascular and noncardiovas-
cular outcomes in a national cohort of US veterans. Secondary
analyses considered associations of statin dosing, periopera-
tive patterns of use, subgroup interactions, and potential se-
lection biases with outcome.
Methods
Perioperative risk, process, and outcome data from patients
undergoing noncardiac surgical procedures in 7 surgical sub-
specialties (neurosurgery and vascular, general, orthopedic,
thoracic, urologic, and otolaryngologic surgery) were derived
from the Veterans Affairs (VA) Surgical Quality Improvement
Program (VASQIP) database as previously described.15 These
data were supplemented with discharge and treatment codes
from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revi-
sion, Clinical Modification. The discharge and treatment codes
wereextractedfromtheVeteransHealthAdministration(VHA)
outpatient care and patient treatment files; prescription data,
from the outpatient and inpatient Pharmacy Benefit Manage-
ment databases (eTables 1 and 2 in the Supplement).16 Data-
bases were linked by scrambled Social Security numbers. The
data collection period spanned October 1, 2005, to Septem-
ber 30, 2010. Surgical procedures performed during the first
90 days or last 30 days of this interval were excluded so that
90-day preoperative statin treatment and 30-day postopera-
tive outcomes could be assessed uniformly in all subjects. This
study was approved by the US VHA Office of Patient Care Ser-
vices and the institutional review boards of the San Francisco
and Denver Veterans Affairs Medical Centers, who waived the
need for informed consent.
We considered patients undergoing elective or emergent
surgery who were admitted to hospital on the day of or within
7 days of surgery, with a hospital stay lasting at least through
the day after surgery. Patients who died on the day of or the
dayaftersurgerywereexcluded.Forpatientswithmultiplerec-
ords in the VASQIP database within this time frame, one was
chosen randomly.
Prescription data grouped by VA National Formulary Drug
Class are shown in eTable 1 in the Supplement. We subcatego-
rizedprescriptionsintheantilipemicclassbyindividualstatins
andthedoseprescribed,allowingcategorizationbystatininten-
sitygroups(low,moderate,orhigh)pertheAmericanCollegeof

a statin and nonstatin were coded as statin combinations, with

diac risk index component variables were coded as previously
reported (eTable 3 in the Supplement).15,17

Key Points
Question Is exposure to a statin in the early perioperative period
associated with reduced postoperative complications after
noncardiac surgery?
Findings This observational cohort analysis of veterans linked risk
and outcome data from the Veterans Affairs Surgical Quality
Improvement Program database to statin prescriptions in 180 478
patients and evaluated the associations of early statin exposure on
30-day mortality. After adjustment for risk, other medications
used, and potential selection biases, 30-day mortality was
significantly reduced in the statin-exposed group.
Meaning Perioperative statin use may be beneficial in reducing
30-day mortality, although the effects of selection biases cannot
be excluded.

bosis, pulmonary embolus, and graft or prosthesis failure), in-
fection (sepsis, organ space infection, and deep wound infec-
tion), respiratory (failure to wean from mechanical ventilation,
pneumonia, and reintubation), renal (acute renal failure, re-
nalinsufficiency),oracompositeofanyofthesesecondaryout-

tory or the infection category (discussed below). Events
occurringwithinthe2-dayexposureperiodwereexcludedfrom
theanalysis,withtheexceptionoforganspaceanddeepwound
infection, for which dates of occurrence were not available in
our data set.
Statistical Analysis
DatawereanalyzedfromNovember28,2013,toOctober31,2016.
Tocontrolforpotentialtreatment-selectionbias,weperformed
apropensityscore–matchedanalysis.18Thepropensityscorees-

posure on the day of surgery or day after surgery was regressed
on risk or process variables that we considered associated with
statin exposure or any outcome with prevalence in the data set
of at least 1% (eTable 4 in the Supplement). To adjust for poten-
tialregionaleffects,weincludedavariableforeachof21admin-
istrativegeographicalregionsintheVAhealthsystem.Toavoid
immortal time bias, we performed a landmark analysis, elimi-
natingpatientswhodiedorsustainedanyofthesecondarymor-
bidity outcomes during the exposure period.21
Propensity score–matching (1:1) was conducted by match-
ing pairs of patients with statin exposure and no exposure with
a greedy matching algorithm and a caliper width of 0.2 SD of
the log odds of the estimated propensity score.22 Covariate bal-
ance between matched pairs for continuous and dichoto-
mous categorical variables was assessed using the standard-
izeddifference,withvaluesequaltoorlessthan10%indicating
minimal imbalance.23 We used the McNemar test to compare
the frequency of the primary and secondary outcomes be-
tween the matched groups.24 Relative risks (RRs) were com-
puted using methods appropriate for paired data and are pre-
sented with their 95% CIs. Numbers needed to treat were
calculated as the inverse of the absolute risk reduction esti-
mated in the propensity score–matched sample. Details of sen-
sitivity analyses for the primary and secondary outcomes are
presented in the eMethods and eResults in the Supplement.
Continuousandcategoricalvariableswerecomparedusing
parametric or nonparametric methods as appropriate. We cal-
culated RRs or ORs with 95% CIs. Categorical trends were as-
sessed using the Cochran-Armitage trend test. We used SAS
software (version 9.4; SAS Institute Inc) for all analyses, with
2-tailed P < .05 considered significant.
Results
TheinitialVASQIPcohortofpatientsundergoingsurgeryinour
selected surgical subgroups consisted of 334 130 patients. We
excluded 153 652 patients after adjustment for (1) the 90-day
prehospital admission and 30-day postoperative assessment
periods(n = 13 010);(2)admissionmorethan7daysbeforesur-
gery (n = 12 541); (3) minimum length of stay criteria
(n = 54 877) (including 468 patients dying on the day of or the
day after surgery); (4) random exclusion of patients undergo-
ing multiple surgical procedures in the assessment period
(n = 34 088); (5) admission after the date of surgery (n = 2648);
and (6) patients undergoing an assessed operation within 30
days of another procedure and combinations of any of the
abovecriteria(n = 36 488).Thefinalcohortconsistedof180 478
patients at 104 VHA hospitals (95.6% men and 4.4% women;
mean [SD] age, 63.8 [11.6] years). Of these, 52 642 (29.2%) were
admitted before the day of surgery and 127 836 (70.8%) on the
day of surgery. The propensity score–matched cohort in-
cluded 96 486 patients (96.3% men and 3.7% women; mean
[SD] age, 65.9 [10.6] years).
The 30-day all-cause mortality rate for the entire cohort
was 2.2% (n = 3975). Mortality varied significantly by surgi-
cal subgroup (vascular, 2.6%; general, 3.2%; orthopedic, 1.5%;
and aggregated remaining specialties, 1.8%; P < .001 for dif-
ferences among categories).
Pertinent demographic and clinical characteristics be-
fore and after propensity score matching are presented in
Table 1 and Table 2. Before matching, the statin-exposed group
was older and more likely to be male and had a higher burden
of existing cardiovascular risk factors, a greater prevalence of
established cardiovascular disease, more revised cardiac risk
index factors, a higher American Society of Anesthesiology
physical status classification, and a greater likelihood of un-
dergoing vascular or orthopedic surgery.
Analyses of Statin Exposure
Thedistributionofstatinexposureandcovariatemedicationuse
are presented in Table 3 in the entire and propensity score–
matchedcohorts.Intheentirecohort,anyoutpatientstatinpre-
scriptionwithinthe90-daypreadmissionperiodwasidentified
among47.2%ofpatients,including37.8%withanactiveprescrip-
tionatthetimeofhospitaladmission.Asimilarpercentageofuse
(169patients[36.1%])wasnotedamongthe468patientswhodied
within the exposure period and were excluded from the cohort
based on a landmark analysis. A new prescription for a statin
within14daysofadmissionwasissuedinonly0.9%ofpatients.
Themostcommonlyprescribedstatinwassimvastatin(80.8%).
Moderate-intensity dosing was most common (59.5% of statin
users). Statin availability at the time of admission increased
monotonically during the 5 fiscal years from 35.5% to 39.1%
(P < .001). Prescription of high- and moderate-intensity doses
relativetolow-intensitydosesincreasedfromyear1(high,7.1%;
moderate, 21.7%; and low, 6.7%) to year 5 (high, 10.6%; moder-
ate, 22.7%; and low, 5.8%) (P < .001). Significant differences in
outpatient statin use were noted among patients undergoing
vascular surgery (53.9%), general surgery (33.4%), orthopedic

Patientsinthestatin-exposedgrouphadsignificantlygreatercon-
current use of nonstatin agents to lower lipid levels and other
types of cardiovascular medications. In the propensity score–
matched cohort, differences in statin use persisted but with no
significant differences in the use of nonstatin medications.
Of the entire cohort, regardless of their outpatient status,
31.5% were exposed to a statin on the day of or the day after
surgery. Exposure rates differed significantly between surgi-
cal subgroups (vascular surgery, 50.1%; general surgery, 18.6%;
orthopedic surgery, 38.8%; and aggregated remainder, 29.7%;
P < .001). Of patients with an active outpatient prescription at
the time of admission, 62.0% were exposed to a statin on the
day of and/or the day after surgery and 38.0% were not ex-
posed. The exposure rate varied significantly between surgi-
calsubgroups(vascularsurgery,66.6%;generalsurgery,41.2%;
orthopedic surgery, 78.1%; and aggregated remainder, 62.0%;
P < .001). Of patients without an active statin prescription on
admission, 13.1% were exposed to statin on the day of and/or
the day after surgery (vascular surgery, 30.9%; general sur-
gery, 7.3%; orthopedic surgery, 15.4%; and aggregated remain-
der, 11.6%; P < .001). Patients in the statin-exposed group had
significantly greater concurrent use of nearly all of covariate
medications considered in this analysis (Table 3).
Association of Statin Exposure With Outcomes
The primary and secondary outcomes for the entire cohort
and the matched cohort are presented in Table 4. The pro-
pensity score–matched analyses for the primary and second-
ary outcomes are presented in Table 5. For the primary out-
come, we matched 96 486 patients, corresponding to 71.9%
of all patients in the cohort with an active statin prescription
on admission. Mean standardized differences before and
after matching are presented in eTable 5 in the Supplement.
All mean standardized differences were less than 10%, which
is consistent with an adequate balance of covariates. Statin
exposure on the day of or the day after surgery was associ-
ated with a reduced 30-day all-cause mortality (RR, 0.82;
95% CI, 0.75-0.89; P < .001; number needed to treat, 244;
95% CI, 170-432). Significant risk reductions were noted for
each of the secondary outcomes (RR for any, 0.82; 95% CI,
0.79-0.86; P < .001; number needed to treat, 67; 95% CI,
55-87), with the exception of central nervous system and
thrombosis categories. The greatest risk reduction (RR, 0.73;
95% CI, 0.64-0.83) was noted for cardiac complications. Con-
sidering pneumonia as a component of the respiratory or
infection categories did not alter statistical significance of
either group. The number needed to treat for the aggregate of
any complication was 67.
Of the 1659 patients identified as having a new prescrip-
tion with 14 days of admission, we noted a high unadjusted,
primary outcome event rate (198 [11.9%]) vs 3777 (2.1%) in
the remaining 178 819 patients (RR, 6.28; 05% CI, 5.39-7.31;
P < .001). New use was significantly higher in the vascular
surgery group (1.5%) compared with the general surgery
(1.0%) and orthopedic surgery (0.7%) groups and the aggre-

Discussion
The present analysis indicates that statin use on the day of
and/or the day after noncardiac surgery as defined by an
active inpatient prescription is associated with lower 30-day
all-cause mortality and reduction in a variety of postopera-
tive complications (most notably cardiac), compared with
nonuse during this period. Subanalyses indicate that
patients with ischemic heart disease or diabetes, those
younger than 75 years, those undergoing high-risk surgery,
and those receiving intensive statin therapy may have
greater risk reduction with perioperative statin treatment
and that perioperative withdrawal of statin treatment may
be associated with adverse outcomes.
Although earlier literature suggested a perioperative ben-
efitofstatintherapyinnoncardiacsurgery,thatconclusionwas
based on limited data from randomized clinical trials and pre-
dominantly small, single-center observational analyses.25,26
Meta-analyses provide conflicting evidence, depending on in-
clusion or exclusion of observational analyses along with ran-
domized clinical trials or the inclusion of controversial analy-
ses from the Erasmus University group.11 Sanders et al7
performed a meta-analysis (excluding trials from the
Erasmus University group27) and concluded that the evi-
dence was insufficient to support an effect of perioperative
statinuseonall-causeorcardiovascularmortalityorsafetyout-
comes. In contrast, Antoniou et al8 considered 4 randomized
clinical trials and 20 observational cohort analyses (includ-
ing several from the Erasmus University group) and reported
significant associations with all-cause perioperative mortal-
ity (OR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.38-0.78), myocardial infarction (OR,
0.62; 95% CI, 0.45-0.87), stroke (OR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.39-
0.67), and their composite (OR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.29-0.70), with
no reduction in cardiovascular mortality or renal injury.

users matched with 4492 controls) with cardiovascular and all-
causemortalityfromtheVascularEventsinNoncardiacSurgery

sources, outcome definitions, types of surgery, and preopera-
tive vs perioperative statin use. Effects of statins on respira-
tory or infectious complications in medical patients are con-
troversial, with limited data in the perioperative setting.
LeManachetal30reportednodifferenceinpostoperativepneu-
monia in a vascular cohort, and Yadav et al33 reported no dif-
ference in rates of early postoperative adult respiratory dis-
tress syndrome in patients undergoing aortic vascular or
thoracic surgery. However, Iannuzzi et al13 reported a reduc-
tion in an aggregated respiratory (OR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.50-
0.79) and infection-related (OR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.45-0.94) com-
plication in statin users undergoing primarily noncardiac,
nonvascular surgery.
Insensitivityanalyses(presentedintheeMethodsandeRe-
sults in the Supplement), we found evidence that periopera-
tive outcomes were favorably affected by moderate- to high-
intensity dosing (relative to no or low-intensity dosing). This
finding is concordant with observations in 5 randomized sec-
ondary prevention trials that more intensive statin therapy is
associated with fewer cardiovascular events than less inten-
sive therapy.34 The present findings also align with a recent
single-center trial of 500 patients with stable coronary artery
disease receiving long-term statin therapy who underwent
emergency noncardiac surgery.35 Patients were randomized to
continue their outpatient statin treatment or to undergo statin
reloading with atorvastatin calcium, 80 mg 2 hours before
surgery. The reloaded group had lower rates of 30-day major
adverse cardiac events and atrial fibrillation and a shorter
duration of hospitalization. Similar findings of improved out-
comes with preoperative statin therapy intensification are sug-
gested in the meta-analyses of patients undergoing percuta-
neous coronary intervention or cardiac surgery.36,37 However,
our observation of a possible association of high-intensity dos-
ing with renal injury suggests the need for further study, par-
ticularly given similar associations in 2 recent trials studying
patients undergoing cardiac surgery.38,39
Additional sensitivity analyses were performed to evalu-
ate the potential for several types of selection bias that may
confoundstatinuse.Theseincludetheeffectofprevalent(long-
term) vs incident (new) statin use and of variables that may
reflect socioeconomic status.40-42 These analyses suggest a
marginally favorable effect of longer-term use (6 months to 1
year before admission) on mortality and several complica-
tions.Withregardtonewusers,ouranalysissuggeststhatmost
(78.1%) were actually prior users with variable adherence to
themedicationregimen.Thestrikinglyhighereventratenoted
in this group suggests they belong to patient subgroups re-
cently identified at higher risk for adverse long-term cardio-
vascular outcomes with discontinuation of statin and/or an-
giotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy.43,44 The
complexities of quantifying variable patterns of statin therapy
adherence for primary or secondary prevention, their clinical
and socioeconomic predictors, and methods for prevention re-
main a focus of active research in the general medicine
setting.45-47 Analysis of available socioeconomic variables re-
vealedunexpectedfavorableassociationsofnonwhiteraceand
smoking with our primary outcome, whereas adverse asso-
ciationswithseveralofoursecondarycomplicationsweremore
consistent with healthy user bias. Consideration of addi-
tional variables related to educational level, income, number
of primary care visits, etc, might help to clarify whether se-
lection bias in statin treatment might in turn have influenced
the results of the present analysis.
A notable finding was the frequency with which outpa-
tientstatinprescriptionswerenotcontinuedinthecriticalperi-
operative period. Similar findings have been reported by oth-
ersandhavebeenassociatedwithadverseoutcome.48Because
statin exposure on the day of and the day after surgery was sig-
nificantly associated with more favorable surgical outcomes,
this observation suggests the need for medication reconcili-
ation practices to minimize interruption of established statin
therapy in patients undergoing surgery. With increased em-
phasis on such practices,4 interruption of perioperative statin
therapy may have become less frequent in years subsequent
to the analysis period of this report.
Limitations
The limitations of our study include those common to pharma-
coepidemiologicanalyseswheretheindicationsforprescription

Conclusions
Early perioperative exposure to a statin was associated with a
significant reduction in all-cause perioperative mortality and
several cardiovascular and noncardiovascular complica-
tions. However, the potential for selection biases in these re-
sults must be considered.
