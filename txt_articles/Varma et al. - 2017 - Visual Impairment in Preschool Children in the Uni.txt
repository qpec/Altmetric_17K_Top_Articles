IMPORTANCE Visual impairment (VI) in early childhood can significantly impair development.
OBJECTIVE To determine demographic and geographic variations in VI in children aged 3 to 5
years in the United States in 2015 and to estimate projected prevalence through 2060.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Descriptive study reporting statistics estimated based
on prevalence data from 2 major population-based studies conducted in the United States
between 2003 and 2011. Using US census projections, prevalence of VI and cause-specific VI
in the better eye were reported by race/ethnicity, state and region, and per capita prevalence
of VI by state. The study included preschool children in the United States. Analyses for this
study were conducted between February 2016 and March 2017.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Prevalence of VI among children aged 3 to 5 years in the
United States.
RESULTS In 2015, more than 174 000 children aged 3 to 5 years in the United States were
visually impaired. Almost 121 000 of these cases (69%) arose from simple uncorrected
refractive error, and 43 000 (25%) from bilateral amblyopia. By 2060, the number of
children aged 3 to 5 years with VI is projected to increase by 26%. In 2015, Hispanic white
children accounted for the highest number of VI cases (66 000); this group will remain the
most affected through 2060, with an increasingly large proportion of cases (37.7% in 2015
and 43.6% in 2060). The racial/ethnic group with the second most VI is projected to shift
from non-Hispanic white children (26.3% in 2015 decreasing to 16.5% in 2060) to African
American children (24.5% in 2015 and 22.0% in 2060). From 2015 to 2060, the states
projected to have the most children with VI are California (26 600 in 2015 and 38 000 in
2060), Texas (21 500 in 2015 and 29 100 in 2060), and Florida (10 900 in 2015 and 13 900
in 2060).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE These data suggest that the number of preschool children
with VI is projected to increase disproportionally, especially among minority populations.
Vision screening for refractive error and related eye diseases may prevent a high proportion
of preschool children from experiencing unnecessary VI and associated developmental
delays.

 V
isual impairment (VI) in early childhood can signifi-
cantly impair development of visual, motor, and cog-
nitive function1-3 and lead to adverse psychosocial
consequences.4Forexample,theVisioninPreschoolersstudy5
reported that VI from uncorrected hyperopia was associated
with deficits in early literacy and in other essential skills for
school readiness. More importantly, interventions, such as
spectacle correction in preschool children, have been shown
to restore the visual-motor function of affected ametropic
preschool children back to emmetropic levels.3
IntheUnitedStates,reducingVIinchildrenandadolescents
isoneoftheobjectivesofHealthyPeople2020.6However,toour
knowledge, there is no coordinated surveillance of eye and vi-
sionhealthintheUnitedStates.Asaresult,therehasbeenalack
of accurate data characterizing the prevalence of VI in the US
preschoolpopulation.Twolarge-scale,population-basedstud-
ies, the Multi-Ethnic Pediatric Eye Disease Study (MEPEDS)7,8
and the Baltimore Pediatric Eye Disease Study (BPEDS),9 were
conjointlydesignedtoestimatetheprevalenceofoculardisease
and refractive error (RE) among preschool children from the 4
most populous racial/ethnic groups (African American, Asian
American, Hispanic/Latino, and non-Hispanic white), using
shared protocols. Between 2008 and 2013, these studies pub-
lished their estimates on the prevalence of early childhood VI
based on the standardized, comprehensive ophthalmic exami-
nation of approximately 12 000 children aged 6 to 72 months.
IntheMEPEDS,ahigherprevalenceofpresentingRE-relatedVI
wasseeninAfricanAmericanandHispanicchildrenthanineither
Asian or non-Hispanic white children. Using age- and race/
ethnicity–specific prevalence data on VI from these 2 studies,
coupled with the 2015 updates in the national population pro-
jections from the US Census Bureau,10 this study provides esti-
mates of the current and expected numbers of VI cases among
preschool children in the United States from 2015 to 2060.
Furthermore, we identified subgroups (race/ethnicity and re-
gions/states) expected to experience a higher number and/or
prevalenceofVIcasesoverthenext4.5decadeswithintheUnited
States and estimated the current and expected numbers and
prevalenceofVIpotentiallyimprovedthroughrefractivecorrec-
tion (eg, glasses, contact lenses, or refractive surgery). We lim-
ited our analyses to children aged 3 to 5 years, among whom
visualacuity(VA)canbemorereliablyassessedthaninyounger
children11 and among whom VA screening is recommended.12
Findings from this study will be useful for the design of vision
screeningamongpreschoolchildren,allocationofpublichealth
resources, and policy planning.
Methods
We estimated the prevalence and number of preschool chil-
dren aged 36 to 72 months in the United States overall and in
subgroups defined by race/ethnicity and by state and region
of residence. The projected number of children with VI was
estimated by multiplying the age- and race/ethnicity–specific
prevalence rate of VI by the number of corresponding chil-
dren. For children aged 36 to 72 months, there was no evi-
dence that VI prevalence varied by sex.7,8 Neither institu-
tional review board approval nor patient consent was required
because this study was based on (1) published prevalence es-
timates by the MEPEDS and BPEDS and (2) census estimates
on US population. No individual-participant data were used.
Wecalculatedtheprevalenceandnumbersofchildrenwith
VIintheUnitedStatesfor6racial/ethnicgroups:AfricanAmeri-
canchildren,AsianAmericanchildren,Hispanicwhitechildren,
non-Hispanicwhitechildren,otherminoritychildren,andmul-
tiracial American children. The term other minority children is
based on the census data on race/ethnicity and refers to popu-
lations classified as American Indian, Alaskan Native, Native
Hawaiian, or other Pacific Islander alone. Multiracial American
childrenreferstoAmericanchildrenwhochose2ormoreracial/
ethnic categories. All US population estimates and projections
were obtained from data available at http://www.census.gov.
Hispanic origin was considered an ethnicity, and Hispanic chil-
drenmaybeofanyrace.In2015,50%ofchildrenaged3to5years
were non-Hispanic white, 22% were Hispanic white, 15% were
African American, 5% were Asian American, and 6% were
multiracial American. The corresponding figures in 2060 are
projected to be 34%, 28%, 15%, 8%, and 12%, respectively.
Age-specific prevalence of VI for African American chil-
dren, Asian American children, Hispanic white children,
and non-Hispanic white children were estimated by the
MEPEDS7,8 and the BPEDS,9 which are, to our knowledge,
the only 2 population-based pediatric eye studies under-
taken in the United States. The MEPEDS enrolled 9197 chil-
dren aged 6 to 72 months (80% participation) living in 100
selected census tracts in Los Angeles County, California, in
and around the cities of Alhambra, Inglewood, and Glendale
and in Riverside County, California, in the city of Riverside.
The BPEDS enrolled 2546 children (62% participation) aged
6 to 71 months from 54 contiguous census tracts in north-
eastern and eastern Baltimore City, Maryland, and adjacent
portions of Baltimore County. Participating children under-
went comprehensive ophthalmic evaluation including pre-
senting monocular VA testing (with correction, if worn),
cover testing, cycloplegic autorefraction, fundus evaluation,
and VA retesting with refractive correction. Visual impair-
ment was defined as decreased VA (<20/50 in children 36 to
47 months of age or <20/40 in children 48 months of age or
Key Points
Question What are the demographic and geographic variations in
visual impairment in preschool children in the United States in
2015 and what is the projected prevalence through 2060?
Findings In this prevalence study, the number of preschool
children with visual impairment is projected to increase by 26% in
2060, with 69% of visual impairment resulting from simple
uncorrected refractive error. Hispanic white children will account
for the largest number and proportion of cases, followed by
African American children.
Meaning Vision screening and early intervention targeting
preschool populations might prevent unnecessary VI and
associated developmental delays such as poor reading skills.

 older) in the better-seeing eye in the presence of an identifi-
able ophthalmic etiology. An analysis of VA norms in
MEPEDS13 showed that while 99% of children aged 48
months or older achieved at least 20/40, only 91% of chil-
dren aged younger than 48 months did; however, 96% of
these younger children achieve at least 20/50. Visual
impairment was further classified into 3 types based on the
identified ophthalmic causes: (1) simple uncorrected RE if
VA normalized with retesting (resolving) in the presence of
visually significant uncorrected RE at presentation (spheri-
cal equivalent myopia of at least −0.5 diopters [D], spherical
equivalent hyperopia of at least 3.0 D, or astigmatism of any
axis of at least 1.5 D); (2) bilateral amblyopia if VA did not
normalize with retesting (nonresolving) in the presence of
criteria for bilateral amblyopia (bilateral decreased best-
measured VA after retesting with refractive correction and 1
of the following risk factors: bilateral hyperopia of at least 4
D, bilateral myopia of at least 6 D, bilateral astigmatism of at
least 2.5 D, or bilateral form deprivation) or probable bilat-
eral amblyopia (bilateral decreased best-measured VA,
meeting risk factor criteria in 1 eye, and within 0.25 D of
meeting risk factor criteria in the other eye); and (3) ocular
disease if VA did not normalize with retesting (nonresolv-
ing) in the presence of visually significant ocular disease
(normal vision precluded by an anterior segment abnormal-
ity, fundus abnormality, or nystagmus).
Because there were no prevalence data available for other
minority children and multiracial American children, we used
the unweighted mean of the pooled age-specific rates for
non-Hispanic white children, African American children,
Hispanic white children, and Asian American children. Age-
specific prevalence of VI was assumed to be constant through-
out the projection period to 2060.
Summary descriptions of these studies are given in
eTable 1 in the Supplement. Age-specific and cause-specific
summary pooled prevalence estimates of VI and blindness
were calculated by combining age, race/ethnicity, and
cause-specific numbers from the 2 studies (eTable 2 in the
Supplement).
Statistical Methods
Estimates of pooled prevalence for VI by age and race/ethnicity
were multiplied by corresponding stratum-specific population
estimatestoobtainthenumberofchildrenaged36to72months
with VI in the United States from 2015 to 2060. Similar calcula-
tions were completed for each state and region. Prevalence per
capita was defined as the number of children aged 3 to 5 years
withVIasaproportionofthenumberofchildrenaged3to5years
in each state based on the US census. Conservative confidence
intervalsfortheestimatedprevalencewerecalculatedbasedon
aγdistributionusingtheFayandFeuer14methodavailableinSAS,
version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc).
Census estimates for state resident populations for the 6
racial/ethnic groups by single year of age are available for 2015
but not for 2060. To obtain 2060 estimates, we calculated the
stratum-specific change rates in the national population from
2015 to 2060 and applied these change rates to the stratum-
specific state populations in 2015.
Sensitivityanalyseswereperformedonprevalenceestimates
by using pooled prevalence from MEPEDS and BPEDS (eTable 3
intheSupplement:mainmodel)vsonlyfromMEPEDS(scenario
1). We then compared the estimates from scenario 1 with those
obtainedfromthemainmodel.AllreportedPvalueswere2-sided
with a significance level set at .05.
Results
Current and Projected Estimates of VI in Preschool Children
in the United States in 2015 and 2060
In 2015, for preschool children aged 36 to 72 months in the
United States, the overall estimated prevalence of VI was 1.5%
(95% CI, 1.2% to 1.8%). We based these summary estimates on
pooled prevalence estimates by age and race/ethnicity (eTable
2 in the Supplement), which reveal a higher prevalence of VI
amongHispanicAmericanandAfricanAmericanchildrenthan
among Asian American and non-Hispanic white children.
In the United States in 2015, 174 600 children aged 36 to
72 months were visually impaired (Table 1) based on present-

 ing VA of the better-seeing eye. In 2060, an estimated 220 600
children (Table 2 and Figure 1) are projected to be visually im-
paired (an increase of 26%), while the total number of chil-
dren aged 36 to 72 months is expected to increase by 14%.
In 2015, with respect to race/ethnicity, Hispanic white chil-
dren represented the largest proportion of VI cases (n = 65 942;
38%), followed by non-Hispanic white children (n = 45 960;
26%), African American children (n = 42 744; 25%), multiracial
American children (n = 11 254; 6.4%), Asian American children
(n = 5015; 2.9%), and other minority children (n = 3649; 2.1%).
Through 2060, the number of children with VI is projected to
increase for multiracial, Asian American, Hispanic white and
AfricanAmericanchildrenbutdecreasefornon-Hispanicwhite
and other minority children. By 2060, multiracial children will
havethelargestincrease(137%),followedbyAsianAmericanchil-
dren (81%), Hispanic white children (46%), and African Ameri-
can children (13%), whereas non-Hispanic white children will
have the greatest decrease (−21%), followed by other minority
children(−3%).MostVIcaseswillremainamongHispanicwhite
children but to a greater degree (44% in 2060 vs 38% in 2015,
Table2).Therace/ethnicitygroupwiththesecondhighestnum-
ber of VI cases is projected to shift from non-Hispanic white
(n = 36 422; 16.5%) to African American children (n = 48 518;
22.0%).Similarrace/ethnicity–specificpatternsareprojectedfor

GeographicDistributionoftheEstimatedNumberofPreschool
ChildrenWithVIintheUnitedStatesin2015and2060
In 2015, the 3 states with the highest numbers of children aged
36 to 72 months with VI were California, Texas, and Florida
(26 600,21 500,and10 900,respectively).In2060,thesestates
are projected to continue having the most cases (38 000,
29 100,and13 900,respectively),withincreasesof43%inCali-
fornia, 35% in Texas, and 27% in Florida. These states also rep-
resent the largest projected increase, accounting for approxi-
mately 48% of the national growth in VI cases.
In 2015, the states with the highest per capita prevalence
of VI were the District of Columbia, New Mexico, and Texas
(19.2, 18.5, and 18.0 cases per 1000 children, respectively;
Figure 2). In 2060, the prevalence of VI is projected to be high-
est in New Mexico, followed by the District of Columbia and
Texas (19.9, 19.7, and 19.4 cases per 1000 children, respec-
tively; Figure 3). By 2060, the prevalence of VI is projected to
increase and reach at least 14 per 1000 children in 29 states
and at least 17 per 1000 children in 8 states.
In 2015, most cases were located in the South (Table 1,
n = 71 400), followed by the West (n = 46 300), Midwest
(n = 30 700), and Northeast (n = 26 100). While similar geo-
graphicdistributionisprojectedfor2060(eTable4intheSupple-
ment), the region with the largest growth is projected to be the
West (38%), followed by the South (25%), Northeast (23%), and
Midwest(16%).Similargeographicdistributionwasobservedfor
VI from different causes (eFigures 2 and 3 in the Supplement).

 by bilateral amblyopia (n = 43 030; 25%) and ocular disease
(n = 10 971; 6%). By 2060, we project a 28% increase in VI from
simple uncorrected RE and a 25% increase in VI from bilat-
eral amblyopia but only a 16% increase in VI from ocular dis-
ease. Simple uncorrected RE is projected to remain the cause
of most VI cases in 2060 (70%).
Sensitivity Analysis
For the projections for 2015 and 2060, the sensitivity analy-
sesforVIrevealedminimaldifferencesbetweenmodels(eTable
3 in the Supplement), ranging from 2.5% to 3.3%.
Discussion
We estimate that in 2015 in the United States, 174 00 children
aged 3 to 5 years were visually impaired, most (n = 120 600;
69%) owing to simple uncorrected RE, and that Hispanic
white children were the most affected (n = 65 942; 38%). Our
45-year projections indicate a 26% increase in VI in 2060.
Duringthisperiod,Hispanicwhitechildrenwillremainthelarg-
est demographic group in terms of the absolute numbers of VI
cases(44%ofthetotal).MultiracialAmericanchildrenwillhave
the greatest proportional increase (137%), and non-Hispanic
whitechildrenwillhavethelargestproportionaldecrease(21%)
in the number of VI cases.
In2015,HispanicwhitechildrenandAfricanAmericanchil-
dren accounted for 62% of preschool children with VI in the
United States (n = 108 686). This was partly owing to a higher
prevalenceofVIinbothAfricanAmericanchildren(2.35%inthe
better eye) and Hispanic white children (2.47%) than in either
AsianAmericanchildren(0.81%)ornon-Hispanicwhitechildren
(0.77%). As a result, for 2015, the highest per capita prevalence
ofVIisestimatedfortheDistrictofColumbia,NewMexico,and
Texas, the district/states with the highest proportion of African
American children and Hispanic children (69%, 55%, and 59%
respectively in 2015). Over time, multiracial and Hispanic chil-
drenwillcontributetoanincreasinglylargerproportionofpreva-
lent VI. In particular, contributions from multiracial children
will increase by 137%, approaching the contribution from non-
Hispanic white children. This shift in the groups most affected
by preschool VI results from the projected trend of an increas-
inglyraciallyandethnicallydiversechildpopulationintheUnited
States.10AccordingtotheUScensus’
sprojection,duringthenext
45 years, the multiracial, Asian, and Hispanic populations will
be the fastest-growing groups, and by 2060, 64% of children
younger than 18 years will be racial and ethnic minorities.
The high prevalence of VI among Hispanic white, African
American, and multiracial children is of particular concern,
because children of these groups were shown to receive less
vision care than non-Hispanic white children. Data from the
National Health Interview Survey15 indicated that among

 children aged 6 to 17 years, Hispanic children and African
American children were more than 30% less likely to have re-
ceived eye care than non-Hispanic/nonblack children, regard-
less of age, sex, family income, health insurance, and receipt
of well-child care. In addition, several studies have indicated
that children with VI often have other disabling conditions that
would qualify them as children with special health care needs,
requiring more extensive and tailored vision care.16 This fur-
ther compounds the inequity, because children with special
health care needs of African American, Latino, and multira-
cial backgrounds were 2 to 3 times as likely to have unmet need
for vision care as white children with special health care
needs,16 even after controlling for differences in household
structure, socioeconomic status, health status, use of health
services, and perceptions of service professionals.
Refractive error is the leading cause of VI in preschool
children in the United States.7-9 We estimate that in 2015, ap-
proximately69%ofpreschoolchildrenaged3to5yearswithVI
(n = 120 600) could have experienced immediate vision im-
provementthroughproperrefractivecorrection.Inaddition,25%
of VI consisted of cases of bilateral amblyopia, almost entirely
owingtorefractiveerror.Thesedatasuggestthatahighpropor-

dren aged 36 months to younger than 72 months should be

to the National Health Interview Survey, only approximately
40% of preschool children aged 5 years and younger received

with an abnormal screening result were reportedly referred for
follow-up evaluation. This underscores the need for increased

Limitations
Our study has several limitations. First, inherent errors in the
prevalence data from the selected studies and the US census
might skew the accuracy of our predictions. For instance, the
race/ethnicity and age data in the census are self-reported and
therefore may not be accurate. Second, this projection as-
sumes that the age- and race/ethnicity–specific prevalence of
VIwillnotvarydramaticallyovertime,althoughfuturescreen-
ingandtreatmentchangescouldsubstantiallyaffectthepreva-
lence of VI in preschool children. A well-designed national sur-
veillance system that continuously collects population data in
a standardized manner is needed to detect and monitor trends
in the effect of VI and blindness across the United States.20
Third, the estimated VI among children of mixed race or other
minorities (including American Indian, Alaskan Native,
Native Hawaiian, or other Pacific Islander) may not be accu-
ratebecauseofthelackofpopulation-baseddataonthesechild
populations.21 Finally, our estimated prevalence of correct-
ableVIcouldhavebeeninflated:studieshaveshownthatsome

 preschool VI cases associated with RE and resolved through
retesting with correction may actually be attributable to poor
initial test performance. Some such cases can resolve with re-
testing alone before refractive correction.7,8,11 Despite these
limitationsandinherentuncertainties,thisstudy,usingthebest
currently available data, provides valuable insight into pro-
jected caseloads and trends with regard to VI in the preschool
population in the United States from 2015 to 2060.
Conclusions
The number of preschool children with VI is projected to in-
crease disproportionally. Given that most preschool VI can be
prevented or treated by low-cost refractive correction and that
early intervention is critical for better visual outcomes, vi-
sion screening in preschool age and follow-up care will have
a significant, prolonged effect on visual function and aca-
demic and social achievements and therefore should be rec-
ommended for all children. Hispanic white children repre-
sent most preschool VI cases and are projected to represent an
increasingly larger proportion in the next few decades. How-
ever, the largest proportional increase in VI cases is projected
to occur among multiracial children. Consequently, regions
with different demographic compositions will experience the
effect of VI differentially. A coordinated surveillance system
is needed to continuously monitor the effect of preschool VI
on the national, state, and local levels over time.
