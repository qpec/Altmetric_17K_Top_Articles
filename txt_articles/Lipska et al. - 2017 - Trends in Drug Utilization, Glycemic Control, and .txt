Glycemic Control, and Rates of
Severe Hypoglycemia, 2006–2013
Diabetes Care 2017;40:468–475 | DOI: 10.2337/dc16-0985
OBJECTIVE
To examine temporal trends in utilization of glucose-lowering medications, gly-
cemic control, and rate of severe hypoglycemia among patients with type 2 di-
abetes (T2DM).
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
Using claims data from 1.66 million privately insured and Medicare Advantage
patients with T2DM from 2006 to 2013, we estimated the annual 1) age- and sex-
standardized proportion of patients who filled each class of agents; 2) age-, sex-,
race-, and region-standardized proportion with hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) <6%,
6 to <7%, 7 to <8%, 8 to <9%, ‡9%; and 3) age- and sex-standardized rate of severe
hypoglycemia among those using medications. Proportions were calculated over-
all and stratified by age-group (18–44, 45–64, 65–74, and ‡75 years) and number
of chronic comorbidities (zero, one, and two or more).
RESULTS
From 2006 to 2013, use increased for metformin (from 47.6 to 53.5%), dipeptidyl
peptidase 4 inhibitors (0.5 to 14.9%), and insulin (17.1 to 23.0%) but declined for
sulfonylureas (38.8 to 30.8%) and thiazolidinediones (28.5 to 5.6%; all P < 0.001).
The proportion of patients with HbA1c <7% declined (from 56.4 to 54.2%; P < 0.001)
and with HbA1c ‡9% increased (9.9 to 12.2%; P < 0.001). Glycemic control varied by age
and was poor among 23.3% of the youngest and 6.3% of the oldest patients in 2013.
The overall rate of severe hypoglycemia remained the same (1.3 per 100 person-years;
P = 0.72), declined modestly among the oldest patients (from 2.9 to 2.3; P < 0.001), and
remained high among those with two or more comorbidities (3.2 to 3.5; P = 0.36).
CONCLUSIONS
During the recent 8-year period, the use of glucose-lowering drugs has changed
dramatically among patients with T2DM. Overall glycemic control has not im-
proved and remains poor among nearly a quarter of the youngest patients. The
overall rate of severe hypoglycemia remains largely unchanged.
Glycemic management of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) has changed considerably over
the past decade (1,2). Clinicians and patients can now choose from 12 different
classes of glucose-lowering medications to manage hyperglycemia. Unlike insulin or
sulfonylurea drugs, most of the newer agents have not been implicated as a cause of
hypoglycemia, which can be a serious complication of glucose-lowering therapy,
particularly in the elderly (3). However, utilization of these newer agents has sig-
nificantly contributed to increasing costs of diabetes management (4,5).

DIABETES AND AGING
 In addition to changes in drug ther-
apies to reduce glucose levels, the re-
commended target glucose levels have
changed as well. In 2009, based on new
evidence from randomized clinical trials
(6–8), the American Diabetes Association
(ADA) clinical practice guidelines specifi-
cally recommended individualization of
glycemictargetsaccordingtoageandmul-
timorbidity (9). In 2012, the ADA and the
American Geriatrics Society developed a
consensus statement that recognized
that older adults with life-limiting comor-
bidities are less likely to benefit from tight
glycemic control (i.e., reaching a hemoglo-
bin A1c [HbA1c] ,7%) and are more vul-
nerable to hypoglycemia compared with
younger, healthier patients (10). There-
fore, less stringent glycemic targets (i.e.,
HbA1c ,8 or ,9%) may be appropriate in
older patients, particularly in those with
multiple chronic conditions and estab-
lished vascular complications (11).
Given these changes in management
approaches, it is important to examine
the temporal trends in glucose-lowering
medication use, as well as resultant gly-
cemic control and rates of severe hypo-
glycemia.Thesetrendsprovideinformation
about care patterns in response to changes
in treatment options and treatment targets
and can identify gaps in diabetes care and
areas for potential improvement.
A number of studies have separately ex-
amined some of these trends (2,12–16).
Data from physician audits have shown
that patients with diabetes are being pre-
scribed an increasing number of glucose-
lowering medications in ambulatory care
settings (1,2). Separate analysis of data
from the National Health and Nutrition Ex-
amination Survey (NHANES) suggested
that glycemic control has improved, and
just over half of patients achieved an
HbA1c ,7% in 2007–2010 (13). Several
other studies indicated that treatment-re-
lated hypoglycemia continues to pose a
significant health threat, particularly for
older adults and for those with multiple
chronic conditions (12,14,15,17,18).
However, studies looking at medication
prescribing patterns were conducted at
different times and in different patient
populations compared with the studies
lookingatglycemiccontrol,precludingpo-
tential inferences about any association
between medication use, glycemic con-
trol, and hypoglycemia. Moreover, they
did not examine how these trends differ
across age and comorbidity subgroups.
Accordingly, we examined trends in
utilization of drug treatment for diabe-
tes, as well as concurrent trends in gly-
cemic control and rates of hypoglycemia
among privately insured and Medicare
Advantage patients with T2DM from
geographically diverse regions across
the U.S. using OptumLabs Data Ware-
house (OLDW). We examined these
trends in the overall population and in
subgroups of younger and older patients
and among patients with a varying num-
ber of other serious chronic conditions.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
Data Source
We conducted a retrospective analysis of
medical and pharmacy administrative
claimsfromalargedatabase,OLDW,which
includes privately insured and Medicare
Advantage enrollees throughout the U.S.
(19). The database contains data on more
than 100 million enrollees from geograph-
ically diverse regions across the U.S., with
thegreatestrepresentationfromtheSouth
and Midwest (20). We included commer-
cialhealthplansinOLDWthatprovidedfull
coverage for inpatient, outpatient, and
pharmacy services. Medical claims from
inpatient and outpatient visits include
ICD-9-CM (ICD-9, clinical modification) di-
agnosis codes, ICD-9 procedure codes,
Current Procedural Terminology, version
4 procedure codes, Healthcare Common
Procedure Coding System procedure co-
des, site of service codes, and provider
specialty codes. Pharmacy claims include
information on medications dispensed
and size and dates of prescriptions. Study
data were accessed using techniques com-
pliant with the Health Insurance Portability
and Accountability Act of 1996. Because
this study involved an analysis of preexist-
ing, de-identified data, it was exempt from
institutional review board approval.
Study Population
All adults (age $18 years) with at least
1 year of continuous enrollment between
2006 and 2013 were included if they met
criteria for T2DM during at least 1 year of
the study period. The definition of diabe-
tes was based on Health Plan Employer
Data and Information Set criteria: two
face-to-face encounters with a diagnosis
of diabetes (ICD-9 codes 250.x, 357.2,
362.0, and 366.41 [21] in any position on
the claim [22–24]) on different dates of
service in an outpatient setting or non-
acute inpatient setting, or one face-to-face
encounter in an acute inpatient or emer-
gency department (ED) setting, or use of
insulin or oral antihyperglycemic agents
(except metformin monotherapy) based
on pharmacy data. We examined claims
for diabetes ICD-9 codes over a 2-year pe-
riod, which included the year of interest
andtheprecedingyear.Oncepatientsmet
criteria for diabetes in 1 year, they were
considered to have the diagnosis in sub-
sequent years. We excluded adults with a
diagnosis of gestational diabetes (ICD-9
code 648.0) and those with codes for
T1DM (250.x1 and 250.x3). If patients
had codes for both T1DM and T2DM, we
excluded patients who had no claims for
oral glucose-lowering medications.
Main Outcomes
In each year, we determined the propor-
tion of the study population with one or
more pharmacy fills for the different clas-
ses of glucose-lowering agents. Combina-
tionagents were counted as two different
agents filled on the same date. Because
patients could fill more than one class of
agent during each year, the proportion of
patients in each year could exceed 100%.
Because patterns of medication fills may
change over time, we also calculated the
mean number of days covered for each
oral glucose-lowering class of medica-
tions in each year based on the date of
fill and days’ supply. In each year, we de-
termined glycemic control category
(HbA1c ,6, 6 to ,7, 7 to ,8, 8 to ,9,
or$9%) basedonthe last HbA1cobtained
during that calendar year. Data for HbA1c
were available for a subset of patients
based on specific lab vendor. In each
year, we also determined rates of severe
hypoglycemia requiring ED visit or hospi-
tal admission or observation stay based
on validated principal discharge diagnosis
ICD-9 codes (25) among people who filled
at least one glucose-lowering agent. These
values were reported as events per 100
person-years at risk. Person-years at risk
were calculated based on days the patient
was alive, enrolled in the health plan, and
not hospitalized. A separate analysis was
performed among people who filled insu-
lin or insulin secretagogues, other glucose-
lowering medications, and no diabetes
agents.
Independent Variables
Independent variables included baseline
age (18–44, 45–64, 65–74, and $75
years), sex, race (white, black, Hispanic,
Asian, or unknown), region (Midwest,
care.diabetesjournals.org
Lipska and Associates
469
 Northeast, South, and West), and the
number of serious chronic conditions
(zero, one, and two or more). The serious
chronic conditions were based on ICD-9
codes and included chronic kidney dis-
ease, chronic lung disease, heart failure,
myocardial infarction or coronary artery
disease,dementia, depression,atrialfibril-
lation, and stroke (see Supplementary
Table 1 for definitions). Household in-
come was based on data from AmeriLINK
(obtained through KnowledgeBase Mar-
keting) and linked to claims data.
Statistical Analyses
We summarized the characteristics of
the cohort by year. For drug utilization,
glycemic control, and rates of severe
hypoglycemia, we calculated age- and
sex-standardized rates for each year us-
ing 2013 as the reference year. Because
HbA1c was available only for a subset of
the total sample, which varied nonran-
domly by year, we estimated the annual
proportions of patients in each glycemic
control category using multinomial logis-
tic regression with HbA1c category as the
outcome and age, sex, race, and region as
independent variables. We used this
modeltoestimate the HbA1ccategory dis-
tribution for each year. We used logistic
regression to assess annual trends in the
use of each diabetes medication class and
assesstrendsin each glycemiccontrolcat-
egory from 2006 to 2013. The trend in the
number of hypoglycemia events was as-
sessed using linear regression.
Sensitivity Analyses
Some patients were captured in multiple
years of data, raising concern that in-
creasing disease severity over time could
contribute to secular trends. We per-
formed sensitivity analyses that included
only 1 year ofdata per patient, selected at
random from all available years for that
patient (2006–2013). Analyses were per-
formed using SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc.,
Cary, NC) and Stata 14.1 (Stata Corp, Col-
lege Station, TX).
RESULTS
There were 1,657,610 unique patients
with T2DM who met the inclusion criteria
between 2006 and 2013. Among the study
cohort, 33.7% were included in 1 year
only, 25.1% were included in 2 years
only, and 41.2% were included in 3 or
more years.
From 2006 to 2013, as the OLDW ex-
panded, and as diabetes prevalence
increased, the number of patients with
T2DM who contributed data nearly dou-
bled, from ;385,000 in 2006 to ;700,000
in2013(Table1).Mostnotably,theannual
proportion of patients aged 65–74 years
and 75 years or older increased over this
8-year period as OLDW captured an in-
creasing number of Medicare Advantage
enrollees. The burden of comorbidities
and the proportion of patients with two
or more serious chronic conditions also
increased during the observation period.
Drug Utilization
Standardized utilization trends are shown
in Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 2. From
2006 to 2013, use increased for metfor-
min (from 47.6 to 53.5%), dipeptidyl pep-
tidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors (0.5 to 14.9%),
glucagon-like peptide 1 agonists (3.3 to
5.0%), and insulin (17.1 to 23.0%) but de-
clined for sulfonylureas (38.8 to 30.8%)
and thiazolidinediones (28.5 to 5.6%; all
P , 0.001). The increased utilization of
insulin was primarily driven by adoption
of basal insulin analogs (10.9 to 19.3%;
P , 0.001) and rapid-acting insulin ana-
logs (6.7 to 11.6%; P , 0.001). The use of
human insulin products actually declined
(11.6 to 5.6%; P , 0.001). The proportion
of patients with a diagnosis of diabetes
who did not fill any glucose-lowering
medications declined slightly (25.7 to
24.1%; P , 0.001). When considering
treatment complexity, the use of oral
monotherapy increased slightly (from
24.3 to 26.4%) and the use of multiple
(two or more) oral agents declined (from
33.0 to 26.5%), whereas the use of insulin
alone and in combination with oral agents
increased (from 6.0 to 8.5% and from
11.1 to 14.6%, respectively; all P values
,0.001).
The mean number of days covered for
each class of oral glucose-lowering medica-
tions per year increased over the study pe-
riod(SupplementaryTable3),even fordrug
classes with reduced rates of utilization.
Drug utilization varied by age, but over-
all trends were qualitatively similar
(Supplementary Table 4). The use of met-
formin was most prevalent among the
youngestage-group(18–44years).Among
the oldest patients, metformin surpassed
sulfonylureas as the most prevalent diabe-
tes drug class after 2010. DPP-4 inhibitor
use increased among all age subgroups,
with the highest rates of use among mid-
dle-age patients (45–64 years) in 2013.
Use of any insulin increased across all
age subgroups, most steeply among
middle-age and older patients.
Drug utilization also varied by comor-
bidity burden (Supplementary Table 5).
Among patients with two or more seri-
ous comorbidities, metformin, insulin,
and sulfonylureas were all used to a sim-
ilar extent, with a slight increase in met-
formin and insulin use and slight decline
in sulfonylureas by 2013.
Glycemic Control
Laboratory testing for HbA1c was avail-
able on a subset of the total sample
(25.6%). There were regional differences
among patients with and without HbA1c
available (Supplementary Table 6).
Standardized rates of glycemic control
are shown in Fig. 2. From 2006 to 2013,
there were increasing trends in the pro-
portion of patients with HbA1c $9% and
HbA1c8to ,9%(from9.9to12.2%and9.9
to 10.6%, respectively; P , 0.001). The
trend in the proportion of patients with
HbA1c 7 to ,8% was not significant
(from 23.8 to 23.0%; P = 0.31). In contrast,
there were decreasing trends in the pro-
portion with HbA1c 6 to ,7% (41.1 to
43.1%) and HbA1c ,6% (15.3 to 13.1%;
both P , 0.001). Of note, the overall slight
decreasing trend for HbA1c 6 to ,7% oc-
curred despite a slightly higher proportion
of patients in this glycemic category in
2013. Finally, the overall proportion of pa-
tients with HbA1c ,7% declined over this
8-year period: 56.4% in 2006 and 54.2% in
2013, P , 0.001.
Glycemic control varied by age (Sup-
plementary Fig. 1) and number of serious
comorbidities (Supplementary Fig. 2).
Poor glycemic control (HbA1c $9%) was
most common among the youngest pa-
tients but increased slightly over time
across all age subgroups (among the
youngest: 21.1 to 23.3%, P = 0.001; and
among theoldest:5.3to 6.3%, P,0.001).
Similarly, poor glycemic control was most
common among patients without comor-
bidities but increased slightly across all
comorbidity subgroups (no comorbid-
ities: 14.0 to 14.8%, one comorbidity:
12.0 to 12.5%, and two or more comor-
bidities: 10.6 to 11.8%; all P , 0.001).
Severe Hypoglycemia
The age- and sex-standardized rate of se-
vere hypoglycemia among people who
filled at least one prescription for diabe-
tes medications was 1.3 events per 100
person-years in both years 2006 and
2013 (P value for trend over time 0.72)
470

 (Fig. 3A). The proportion of severe hy-
poglycemia that led to hospital admis-
sion declined from 19.2 to 18.2% over
this time period. Rates of severe hypo-
glycemia among patients using insulin or
insulin secretagogues or other glucose-
lowering agents and among those who
filled no medications are shown in Fig. 3B.
Ratesofseverehypoglycemiawerehigh-
est among the oldest patients and those
with multiple comorbidities compared with
younger, healthier adults (Supplementary
Figs.3and4).Ratesofseverehypoglycemia
increased slightly among the youngest
(from 0.8 to 0.9 events per 100 person-
years; P = 0.025) and middle-age (0.6 to
0.9 events per 100 person-years; P ,
0.001) patients and decreased among the
older (1.4 to 1.3 events per 100 person-
years; P , 0.001) and oldest (2.9 to 2.3
events per 100 person-years; P , 0.001)
patients over the study period. Rates of
severe hypoglycemia were also highest
among patients with two or more comor-
bidities compared with those with one or
no comorbidities and did not significantly
change over time (3.2 to 3.5 events per
100 person-years; P = 0.36).
Sensitivity Analyses
Analyses that included only 1 year of
data per patient showed qualitatively
similar results for trends in glycemic
control (Supplementary Table 7). How-
ever, in analyses of severe hypoglyce-
mia, the standardized rate decreased
from 1.5 to 1.2 events per 100 person-
years with a trend P value of ,0.01
(Supplementary Fig. 5).

ications available for T2DM has changed

 dramatically over the past two decades.
From 2006 to 2013, utilization of newer
glucose-lowering agents, such as DPP-4
inhibitors and newer insulin analogs and
their formulations, increased consider-
ably among privately insured patients
with T2DM. The use of older classes of
medications, such as sulfonylureas and
thiazolidinediones, declined. During this
time, glycemic control of T2DM did not
improve in the overall population and
remained poor among nearly a quarter
of the youngest patients. Rates of se-
vere hypoglycemia remained largely un-
changed, with the oldest patients and
those with multiple comorbidities at
highest risk. These findings raise ques-
tions about the value of the observed
shifts in drug utilization toward newer
and costlier medications.
Our findings are consistent with a prior
studyofdrugprescribinginU.S.ambulatory
practice conducted from 1997 to 2012 (2).
In that study, similar increases in DPP-4 in-
hibitor and insulin analog prescribing were
observed; these changes were accompa-
niedbya61%increaseindrugexpenditures
(2). Our study extends these findings to
drug utilization and demonstrates that
these increases occurred in all age and co-
morbidity subgroups.
In contrast, metformin use increased
only modestly between 2006 and 2013
and remained relatively low among older
patients and those with two or more co-
morbidities. Although metformin is rec-
ommended as first-line therapy (26), it
may be underutilized as the initial agent
for the treatment of T2DM (27). Its use
may be additionally limited by coexisting
contraindications, such as chronic kidney
disease (28). Recently, the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) issued a label-
ing change, congruent with recommenda-
tions from the ADA (26), which permits
cautious use of metformin in those with
mild to moderate kidney disease (29). As a
result, it is possible that use of metformin
in these patients may increase further.
We found no overall improvements in
glycemic control among patients with
T2DM; in fact, the proportion of patients
with poor glycemic control increased.
A prior study based on NHANES data
showed an overall 8% increase in the pro-
portion of patients with HbA1c ,7% from
1999–2002 to 2007–2010 (13). However,
the increase occurred early on in the
study, with no significant change in this
proportion from 2003–2006 to 2007–
2010. It is possible that enthusiasm for
intensive glycemic control may have
been dampened by the findings of in-
creased mortality with this strategy in
one trial published in 2008 (8) and the
lack of cardiovascular benefit reported
in two others (6,7). In addition, the ex-
pected glucose-lowering efficacy associ-
ated with some newer agents, such as
the DPP-4 inhibitors, may be relatively
modest(30).Inourstudy,themeannumber
of days covered for each class of glucose-
lowering medications increased over the
study period, thereby reducing the like-
lihood that the overall trend in poor
glycemic control was due to declining
adherence.
Sincethebalance ofbenefitsandharms
of glycemic control differs by age and co-
morbidity burden, we examined glycemic
control trends in relevant subgroups. In
our study, less than half of the youngest
patients (48.0%) but .60% of the oldest
patients (61.6%) achieved an HbA1c ,7%
by 2013. In contrast, nearly a quarter of
the youngest patients (23.3%) but only a
small minority of the oldest patients
(6.3%) had poor glycemic control at the
end of the study period. The youngest
adults in NHANES were also least likely
to achieve recommended HbA1c targets
(13). Limited access to care and lack of
insurance coverage for medications are
known to contribute to suboptimal glyce-
mic control and may partly explain poor
control among the youngest NHANES
participants (31). However, our study in-
cluded adults with full medical and
pharmacy benefits coverage, so lack of
access to care is unlikely to explain our
findings. Young age at diabetes onset
has been associated with worse glycemic
control (32) and more aggressive disease
(33,34). Younger adults also use health
care less often. However, the youngest
adults are generally expected to derive
Figure 1—Age- and sex-standardized proportion of patients with T2DM who filled each class of
glucose-lowering agents, 2006 and 2013 (see Supplementary Table 2 for annual data). Since
patients may fill more than one class in each year, percentages do not add up to 100%. Other
medications were comprised of meglitinides, a-glucosidase inhibitors, SGLT-2 inhibitors, and
amylin analogs. Patients with no fills for glucose-lowering medications were included in the “No
medications” group.

 the most benefit from glycemic control in
the long-term (35). In contrast, many
older adults are less likely to benefit and
are more likely to be harmed by overly
aggressive glycemic control, especially
those with multiple competing health
problems (10,36). At the population level,
the quality of glycemic control in our
study appears to be misaligned given the
likelihood of benefits and harms expected
from intensive glycemic control.
Greater utilization of newer, more ex-
pensive drugs that do not typically cause
hypoglycemia might be expected to re-
sult in lower rates of severe hypogly-
cemia over time. In addition, recent
guidelines have specifically called for
more relaxed glycemic targets and less
intensive treatment among patients at
risk for hypoglycemia (37). However, we
found that the rate of hypoglycemic
events leading to either ED visit or hospi-
talization did not improve over time. We
did find an overall increase in insulin use
(predominantly insulin analogs), which
could have contributed to these trends,
although we also found a decline in the
use of sulfonylureas.
Consistent with prior studies, rates of
severehypoglycemiawerehighest among
oldest adults and those with multiple co-
morbidities (18,38,39). These differences
likely reflect greater vulnerability to hypo-
glycemia among these patients, greater
prevalence of comorbidities that increase
the risk of events (such as renal failure
and dementia), as well as differences in
drug utilization among these age and co-
morbidity subgroups, as discussed above.
Despite the well-known adverse impacts
of hypoglycemia on health-related quality
of life and on multiple health outcomes
(40–42), severe hypoglycemia continues
to pose a threat to the oldest adults and
those with multiple comorbidities.
Our results should be interpreted cau-
tiously, in light of several limitations. Our
analyses were based on medical and
pharmacy claims data, supplemented by
laboratory data. Our large sample of pri-
vately insured patients with T2DM may
not be representative of all privately in-
sured patients in the U.S. Lower rates of
adoption of newer, costlier medications
might be expected in an uninsured pop-
ulation. Moreover, our database (OLDW)
included an increasing number of adults
over time, requiring us to standardize
data by age, race, sex, and region. This
may incompletely capture changes in

sion, observation stay, or emergency department visit per 100 person-years, 2006–2013. A:

 the types of patients included in the
study. Our analyses of glycemic control
relied on HbA1c obtained during routine
care in a subset of the total sample; it is
possible that differences in HbA1c testing
may have occurred over time. In addition,
some patients were captured in multiple
years of data, raising concern that in-
creasing disease severity over time con-
tributed to secular trends. Our sensitivity
analyses showed qualitatively similar
trends but with a reduction in overall hy-
poglycemia over time; however, these
analyses included the greatest represen-
tation of patients who became eligible to
enter the cohort during the last year, and
thus with the shortest duration of diabe-
tes. Our analyses of severe hypoglycemia
captured only those events that led to
hospital or emergency department use,
but did not capture events treated out-
side of those settings. Finally, our study
design precludes causal inference re-
garding the relationships between the
trends in drug utilization, glycemic con-
trol, and hypoglycemia. Therefore, our
discussion with respect to causality re-
mains speculative.
Costs of diabetes care have dramati-
cally increased (2,4,43). Between 1987
and 2011, per person medical spending
attributable to diabetes doubled (4).
More than half of the increase was due
to prescription drug spending (4). Despite
these spending increases and greater uti-
lization of newly developed medications,
we showed no concurrent improvements
in overall glycemic control or the rates of
severe hypoglycemia in our study. Al-
though the use of newer and more expen-
sive agents may have other important
benefits (44), further studies are needed
to define the value and cost-effectiveness
of current treatment options.
