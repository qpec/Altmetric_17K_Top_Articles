Abstract
The emerald jewel wasp (Ampulex compressa) is renowned 
for its ability to zombify the American cockroach (Periplaneta 
americana) with a sting to the brain. When the venom takes 
effect, the cockroach becomes passive and can be led by its 
antenna into a hole, where the wasp deposits an egg and 
then seals the exit with debris. The cockroach has the ability 
to walk, run, or fly if properly stimulated, but it does not try 
to escape as it is slowly eaten alive by the developing wasp 
larva. Although the composition and effects of the wasp’s 
venom have been investigated, no studies have detailed 
how cockroaches might prevent this grim fate. Here it is 
shown that many cockroaches deter wasps with a vigorous 
defense. Successful cockroaches elevated their bodies, 
bringing their neck out of reach, and kicked at the wasp with 
their spiny hind legs, often striking the wasp’s head multiple 
times. Failing this, the elevated, “on-guard” position allowed 
cockroaches to detect and evade the wasp’s lunging attack. 
If grasped, the cockroaches parried the stinger with their 
legs, used a “stiff-arm” defense to hold back the stinger, and 
could stab at, and dislodge, the wasp with tibial spines. Last-
ly, cockroaches bit at the abdomen of wasps delivering the 
brain sting. An aggressive defense from the outset was most 
successful. Thus, for a cockroach not to become a zombie, 
the best strategy is: be vigilant, protect your throat, and 
strike repeatedly at the head of the attacker.

Introduction
The “zombification” of the American cockroach (Peri-
planeta americana) by the emerald jewel wasp (Ampulex 
compressa) stands out as one of the most remarkable and 
well-studied examples of host behavioral manipulation 
by a parasitoid [Williams, 1942; Piek et al., 1984; Veltman 
and Wilhelm, 1991; Richardson and Paul, 1993; Fouad et 
al., 1996; Weisel-Eichler and Libersat, 2002; Haspel and 
Libersat, 2003; Haspel et al., 2003; Libersat, 2003; Gincel 
et al., 2004; Gal et al., 2005, 2014; Keasar et al., 2006; 
Moore et al., 2006; Libersat and Gal, 2007, 2013, 2014; Gal 
and Libersat, 2008, 2010a, b; Libersat et al., 2009; Fox et 
al., 2009; Kaiser and Libersat, 2015]. In order to repro-
duce, the emerald jewel wasp must somehow lead its 
much larger victim to a chamber, glue an egg to the cock-
roach in just the right spot, and seal the chamber with 
debris [Williams, 1942]. The host, which could dig its way

out, must instead remain passively in the chamber while 
it is slowly eaten alive by the developing wasp larva.
Of course, the cockroach does not start out as a willing 
participant in this macabre ritual. The wasp subdues the 
cockroach with a stereotyped attack [Williams, 1942; Piek 
et al., 1984; Veltman and Wilhelm, 1991]. The wasp begins 
by grasping the cockroach just behind the head with its 
curved mandibles (holding fast to the edge of the prono-
tum; Fig. 1) and then delivers two stings. The first sting is 
directed through the soft membranes of the lower thorax 
and thence directly at the part of the cockroach’s nerve 
cord that controls the front legs (the prothoracic ganglion), 
into which venom is delivered [Haspel and Libersat, 2003]. 
This first sting causes temporary paralysis of the front legs 
and is immediately followed by a second sting penetrating 
through the soft connective tissues of the neck and direct-
ly into the brain [Haspel et al., 2003]. This second sting 
causes 30 min of grooming [Weisel-Eichler et al., 1999] 
followed by long-lasting pacification, but not paralysis, of 
the cockroach. After the brain sting, the cockroach can 
walk, run, fly, or swim if properly stimulated, but for weeks 
it does not engage in these behaviors [Piek et al., 1984; 
Weisel-Eichler and Libersat, 2002; Libersat and Gal, 2007]. 
It is said to have lost its free will, and hence is often referred 
to as a zombie. Presumably the wasp’s unusual strategy 
evolved because it cannot carry a large, paralyzed cock-
roach. Instead it needs a walking but behaviorally pliable 
food source for its young that can be led, like a dog on a 
leash [Libersat and Gal, 2007], to a distant chamber where 
it can be safely entombed with the wasp’s egg.
The specificity of the jewel wasp’s attack, targeting ar-
eas of the cockroach’s nervous system, requires much 
greater precision than many parasitoid stings that deliver 
venom systemically into the host hemolymph. Similarly, 
the effect of the venom, which causes sequential changes 
in the cockroach’s behavior, is very specific compared to 
the effect of many parasitoid venoms that cause total pa-
ralysis [Libersat and Gal, 2007]. Yet, despite the efficacy 
of the jewel wasp’s venom, the attack is not without risk, 
nor is it sure to succeed. A number of investigators have 
reported defensive behaviors by cockroaches approached 
by a jewel wasp. Williams [1942] described an intense 
struggle between wasp and roach during which the latter 
parried with its legs and sometimes bit and killed the 
wasp. Richardson and Paul [1993] reported that wasps 
were often damaged during the attack, leading to their 
death. Fox et al. [2009] observed cockroaches preventing 
wasp attacks entirely by elevating their bodies while kick-
ing and biting at the wasps.
In addition to these defensive behaviors reported spe-
cifically during jewel wasp attacks, the more general es-
cape behaviors of the American cockroach have been a 
longstanding focus of neuroethological study, most thor-
oughly investigated for airborne cues generated by pred-
ators [Camhi and Tom, 1978; Ritzmann, 1984; Camhi, 
1988; Ritzmann et al., 1991; Nye and Ritzmann, 1992; 
Ritzmann, 1993] but also for mechanosensory stimuli ap-
plied to the body and antennae [Comer and Dowd, 1993; 
Comer et al., 1994; Schaefer et al., 1994; Ye et al., 2003]. 
These and other features of the American cockroach (e.g.,

giant neurons and large fibers) have made it a convenient 
species for both research and teaching [Oakley and Scha-
fer, 1978; Camhi, 1984].
The jewel wasp’s attack therefore presents a special op-
portunity. It provides a motivated predator that specifi-
cally targets its prey, and thus can be used to reliably and 
repeatedly test and examine the cockroach’s defensive 
repertoire. It seems likely that cockroach defenses have 
evolved in response to a wide range of different predators. 
On the other hand, every jewel wasp is “of cockroach 
born” – the result of a successful attack on a cockroach 
[Williams, 1942]. As a result, the selective pressure for the 
wasp to overcome the specific defenses of the cockroach 
could hardly be higher. We may therefore learn about the 
evolution of the wasp’s unusual attack strategy by better 
understanding the behavior of its target.
In this study, the interactions between cockroaches 
and jewel wasps were investigated by high-speed video to 
determine the range of defensive behaviors used by cock-
roaches and to document the wasp’s attack strategy. The 
aim was to add new detail to an already rich area of neu-
roethology.
Materials and Methods
Emerald jewel wasps (A. compressa) were obtained from Ha-
waii and maintained and bred in an approved insect containment 
facility (facility #3226) under permit No. P526P-17-01368. Lights 
were cycled on a 12/12-h light/dark regimen. The room tempera-
ture was approximately 23  ° C. Supplementary lighting raised the 
temperature of the BioQuip dorms to 25  ° C. Parasitized cock-
roaches were transferred to ventilated 50-mL tubes (Celltreat 
229479 Bio-Reaction Tube; Daigger Scientific Inc.) and placed into 
a separate Plexiglas chamber. Supplementary radiant heat lamps 
and a water chamber maintained the humidity above 50% in the 
chamber at a temperature between 25 and 28  ° C. Hatched wasps 
were sexed, and males were housed with 3–5 per bug dorm. Fe-
males were first introduced into the male cages and given 48 h to 
mate. After mating, each female was maintained individually in a 
1452 BioQuip Bug Dorm (BioQuip Inc., Rancho Dominguez, CA, 
USA) and provided free access to water through a wet sponge 
along with sucrose on a separate wet filter pad. Cockroaches (P. 
americana) were obtained from either a colony at Vanderbilt or 
ordered as adults from Carolina Biological (Carolina Biological 
Supply Company, Burlington, NC, USA). Up to 25 females were 
maintained at a time for several years – individual adults typically 
lived several months.
High-speed macro videos of interactions between wasps and 
cockroaches were recorded at 1,000 frames per second with a Mo-
tionXtra NX7S1 color camera (IDT Inc., Tallahassee, FL, USA) 
with a 28–105 zoom lens and with two RPS Studio CooLED 100 
RS-5610, or with two 120W Intelligent LED Luminaire strobe 
lights (Dynamic Imaging, Brentwood, TN, USA) using a circular 
buffer to capture events that occurred prior to manual triggering. 
Note that this paradigm results in an arbitrary time “zero” indi-
cated on the supplementary Movies S0–S8 (for all online suppl. 
material, see www.karger.com/doi/10.1159/000490341) and the 
Figures. For high-magnification trials, the high-speed camera was 
connected to a Wild M400 dissecting microscope. In some trials, 
cockroaches climbed onto the upper, clear plastic top of the con-
tainer, and were approached by the wasp from below. The videos 
were exported as JPEGs and then opened in QuickTime Player 7 
Pro (Apple Inc.), and the sequences were exported as QuickTime 
movies. Schematic figures were produced in Adobe Illustrator 
(Adobe Systems Inc.), and slow-motion behavioral sequences were 
illustrated by importing selected frames into the document using 
the “place” command. Photos of animal behavior were made with 
a Nikon D5 SLR (Nikon Inc., Melville, NY, USA).
For the real-time behavioral examination of cockroach defens-
es and wasp attacks, data on 37 trials were collected using a 22-cm-
diameter (3.5-cm-depth) circular chamber made from plastic and 
covered with a clear section of Plexiglas. For 18 additional real-
time behavioral trials, a second rectangular chamber measuring 
 
10 × 16 × 7 cm (L × W × H) was used. The behavior was filmed 
with a Nikon D5 camera in video mode. Lighting was provided by 
two RPS Studio CooLED 100 RS-5610 lights.
Jewel wasps had successfully attacked and entombed at least 
one cockroach prior to filming, although these may have been sub-
adult cockroaches. For the behavior trials, adult cockroaches of 
either sex were used. Each cockroach was inspected to ensure that 
all limbs were intact before the trials; those with damaged legs were 
not used. It should be noted that comparatively large cockroaches 
were used in this study (see Figures) because these were most like-
ly to exhibit defense behaviors (no subadults were used).
A cockroach was introduced into the chamber 2 min prior to 
the wasp. The wasp was transferred from the home cage to the 
filming arena in a 50-mL tube and was allowed to enter through a 
small hole in the Plexiglas cover. For the purposes of this study, a 
cockroach was scored as having successfully defended itself against 
an attacking wasp if it had not been stung after 3 min. Trials dur-
ing which the wasp did not stalk the cockroach were not included. 
In all of the real-time behavioral trials, sting 1 by the wasp was fol-
lowed by sting 2, and hence such trials were scored as a failed de-
fense.
For the purposes of this study, high-speed video was used to 
document the range of behaviors exhibited by wasps and cock-
roaches, but these short time segments were not amenable to scor-
ing relative frequencies of behaviors. Statistics (χ2 test, Wilcoxon 
rank sums) were calculated with the JPM software program ver-
sion 14 (SAS).
Results
Keasar et al. [2006] have outlined the sequence of be-
haviors exhibited by the jewel wasp from the first encoun-
ter with a cockroach to successful egg deposition and en-
tombment. They suggest 10 stages that include (1) host 
targeting, (2) thorax sting, (3) head sting, (4) host prob-
ing, (5) antennal cutting, (6) feeding from host, (7) nest 
exploration, (8) host insertion into the nest, (9) oviposi-

tion, and (10) collection of debris to stopper the nest 
opening. From start to finish, this sequence often takes 
well over 1 h to complete. The present study focuses on a 
different side of the interaction: on the behaviors of the 
cockroach during the wasp’s attack. The most relevant 
defensive behaviors occur between host targeting and the 
sting in the head. It is most informative to initially con-
sider the results of the present study in two categories: 
 
(1) cockroaches that defended themselves while being 
stalked, and (2) those that put up no initial defense.
No Defense
Many cockroaches were apparently taken by surprise 
by an aggressive jewel wasp. Others became aware of the 
attacking wasp, as evidenced by evasive turns and at-
tempted escape, but they exhibited no defense while being 
stalked. Running was not considered a defense in the con-
text of the present study, as the cockroaches were by ne-
cessity contained within a comparatively small space (but 
see Discussion). In the absence of any defensive behav-
iors, wasps were typically able to grasp the pronotum and 
rapidly position the abdomen for sting 1. In 5 such trials 
with 5 different wasps, after the pronotum had been 
grasped by the wasp, the stinger was in position for sting 
1 in half a second (mean 512 ms). Note that the latter data 
represent examples from high-speed video and are not 
included in the real-time data analysis (see Materials and 
Methods). Online supplementary Movie S0 shows an ex-
ample of the pronotum grasp in slow motion, with rapid 
stinger placement despite vigorous, but futile, escape at-
tempts by the cockroach (online suppl. Movies S6–S8 
show real-time encounters).
In 55 real-time video trials, roughly half of the cock-
roaches (n = 28) exhibited no initial defensive behaviors 
in response to the stalking wasp. Of those 28 cockroaches, 
all were grasped by the pronotum, and 24 were stung 
(both sting 1 and sting 2). The mean time from the onset 
of stalking to sting 1 in these cases was 11 s. In 4 of the 
“no-defense” trials, the cockroaches were able to subse-
quently escape from the wasp’s hold on the pronotum 
(see next section on Cockroach Defenses for escape strat-
egies) and were not stung within the next 3 min (therefore 
categorized as successful defense). Thus only 14% of the 
cockroaches that did not put up an initial defense avoided 
being stung during the first 3 min.
Cockroach Defenses
The next section describes the commonly observed de-
fensive behaviors that were exhibited while cockroaches 
were stalked and after they had been grasped by the pro-
notum. The chronological series of events that was most 
often observed is first outlined. The behaviors described 
below are not meant to represent an exhaustive list of all 
possibilities, and there are obvious limitations inherent in 
a laboratory setting. With these caveats in mind, defen-
sive behaviors included (in order of occurrence): (1) stilt-
standing, (2) kicking, (3) a contact-triggered escape re-
sponse, (4) an escape response to pronotum grasp, (5) 
raking, stabbing, and a “stiff-arm” defense with leg spines, 
and (6) biting.
In 27 of the 55 real-time video trials, the cockroach be-
gan defending itself as the wasp stalked, as indicated by 
the stilt-standing posture, usually accompanied by kicks 
(14 of 31 females and 13 of 24 males defended them-
selves). In these cases, 10 (7 females and 3 males) of the 
27 cockroaches were stung within the first 3 min, and 
hence were categorized as a failed defense. Still, it took 
successful wasps a mean time of 127 s to sting the 10 cock-
roaches that defended themselves. This was significantly 
longer than with the 24 wasps putting up no defense (p = 
0.0002; Wilcoxon rank-sum χ2 approximation). On the 
other hand, 17 of the 27 cockroaches (63%) that defended 
themselves were able to deter the wasp, or keep it at bay, 
for the first 3 min, and were thus characterized as a suc-
cessful defense. There was a significant difference in wasp 
success when attacking defending and nondefending 
cockroaches (two-tailed χ2 test, p = 0.0002). Details are 
described below.
Stilt-Standing
Once alerted to the presence of a wasp, the cockroach-
es often assumed a stilt-standing defensive posture [Bell 
and Sams, 1973]. During this behavior, the cockroach el-
evated its body by bringing the legs underneath it and 
usually maintained close to a right angle between the fe-
mur and the tibia of the mid- and hind legs (Fig. 2). From 
this “on-guard” position, the cockroach made many pos-
tural adjustments depending on the movements of the 
attacker. Figure 2b illustrates a common variant of the 
stilt-standing posture during which the cockroach rocked 
its body over the legs on the side opposite the approach-
ing wasp and simultaneously angled its body away from 
the wasp. Often, the cockroach then rotated its body to 
position the attacker to the rear (Fig. 2c). Figure 2d shows 
a typical, nondefensive cockroach body posture, which 
can be contrasted with stilt-standing (Fig. 2e, f). The latter 
stance provided a number of advantages that presumably 
generalize to a range of predators. For example, the cock-
roach’s body (and pronotum, the wasp’s target) was ele-
vated and distant from the attacker, which was instead

faced with a phalanx of tibial spines. The closest antenna 
was generally oriented toward the threat, often tracking 
the movements of the wasp through direct contact (Fig. 2f, 
g). But perhaps most importantly, the stilt-standing posi-
tion allowed the cockroach’s hind legs to move through a 
wide arc during defensive kicking at the wasp.
Kicking Defense
Although some apparently defensive extensions of the 
forelegs and midlegs were made, the hind legs were exclu-
sively used for powerful and stereotyped kicks that often 
sent the wasp careening into the walls of the filming 
chamber – or, in larger arenas, threw the wasp many cen-

timeters away (Fig. 3). The kicks had a “windup” phase 
during which the tibia was usually extended at the knee 
joint as the entire hind leg was drawn forward and up; 
then the hind leg swept down and back through the target 
with the inner or ventral surface of the tibia impacting 
(online suppl. Movie S1). The movement was reminiscent 
of a baseball bat swing, in that it required a windup phase, 
a swing phase, and considerable follow-through with the 
entire body of the cockroach. This can be appreciated, for 
example, in clip 4 of online supplementary Movie S1. In 
this trial, there was no interference with the windup (as 
may have occurred in clip 1, when the wall of the chamber

was contacted) and no interference with the swing upon 
impact with the wasp’s head. The swing phase of the kick 
is illustrated schematically in Figure 4a, which shows the 
position of the tibia every millisecond during the swing, 
relative to the starting position of the cockroach’s body. 
The duration of the swing was typical (e.g., online suppl. 
Movie S1).
In all observed cases of defensive kicking, there was di-
rect contact between the wasp and the cockroach prior to 
the kick (online suppl. Movie S1). This suggests that kicks 
are mainly elicited through mechanical cues, as has been 
reported for crickets defending themselves from digger 
wasps [Gnatzy and Heusslein, 1986; Hustert and Gnatzy, 
1995]. Strikes to the wasp’s head followed naturally from 
the probing action of the wasp’s antennae; the wasp leads 
with its head, and the wasp’s antennae usually seemed to 
be the eliciting mechanical stimulus. In addition to re-
sponding with an immediate kick following contact, the 
cockroaches often probed briefly with the distal hind leg 
before initiating a kick, apparently to gage the location of 
their target (online suppl. Movie S1, clips 2, 4, 6, and 7). 
This appeared to be a form of active sensing with the leg.
When the cockroach’s leg was stationary prior to the 
kick, it was often possible to see a specific contact point, 
and sometimes even the deflection of a single tibial spine, 
with a location and timing appropriate for eliciting the 
kick. For example, Figure 4b illustrates a trial during 
which the high-speed camera was attached to a micro-
scope, and a single tibial spine can be seen deflected by 
the antenna of the approaching wasp just prior to the kick 
(online suppl. Movie S1, clip 5).
Clip 6 of online supplementary Movie S1 shows the 
cockroach using its antenna to probe – followed by a 
probing motion with the hind leg, then contact of the 
cockroach’s abdomen with the wasp’s antenna – before 
the kick. Clips 7 and 8 show a wider view and longer en-
counters. In clip 7, the cockroach made two probing mo-
tions with its hind leg. In each case, the wasp’s antenna 
was contacted by the cockroach’s leg, followed immedi-
ately by a kick.
Finally, the role of mechanosensation in eliciting the 
kick was further supported by the serendipitous results 
shown in clip 9 of online supplementary Movie S1. In this 
trial, the wasp was kicked away by the cockroach, but the 
claws of the wasp’s right midleg caught the cockroach’s 
antenna. As the wasp was projected away, the antenna 
was pulled backwards, eventually contacting the distal 
tibia of the cockroach’s hind leg as it returned from the 
kick. The cockroach then (uncharacteristically) initiated 
a second full kick, although there was no stimulus other 
than touch by its own displaced antenna.
Escape Responses
In the trials described above, the cockroach kicked af-
ter somewhat tentative probing contact made by the ap-
proaching wasp with its legs or antennae. After being 
thrown back from a kick, many wasps quickly returned to 
their stalking behavior and were eventually able to prog-
ress to the next stage of attack, which consisted of a sud-
den lunge at the cockroach’s pronotum. When the cock-
roaches were in their stilt-standing posture, their anten-
nae and legs were favorably positioned such that the

wasps often contacted either a foreleg’s tibial spine or the 
ipsilateral antenna during the lunge. In apparent re-
sponse, some cockroaches initiated a successful, short-
latency escape that consisted of a rapid turn away from 
the wasp (Fig. 5a–c), resulting in a failed pronotum grasp 
by the wasp.
Online supplementary Movie S2 clip 1 shows an ex-
ample of a wasp contacting the leg during its attack 
(Fig. 5d). As the wasp lunged, its foreleg rapidly depressed 
and then released a single tibial spine (red arrow in online 
suppl. Movie S2, clip 1; inset in Fig. 5d). Just before the 
wasp reached the pronotum, the cockroach turned away 
in a classic escape response. In other cases, the antenna 
was contacted during the attack, with a similar result. For 
example, in clip 2 of online supplementary Movie S2, the 
wasp’s jaws impacted the antenna prior to reaching the 
pronotum, followed by a successful escape response 
(Fig. 5e). Clip 3 of online supplementary Movie S2 shows 
a similar trial during which the wasp’s antenna contacted 
the cockroach’s antenna during the lunge for the prono-
tum. In this case, the escape response had clearly begun 
prior to contact between the wasp’s jaws and the cock-
roach’s pronotum. In clip 4 of online supplementary Mov-
ie S2 (red arrow), the wasp leapt upward but contacted the 
cockroach’s antenna with its leg. Although the escape re-
sponse in the latter case occurred after contact with the 
pronotum, the short latency suggests the antennal contact 
may have triggered, or contributed to, the escape response.

The trials above were highlighted because they includ-
ed short-latency escapes that suggested the cockroach 
was responding to observable mechanical stimulation 
that occurred during the wasp’s lunge, prior to the wasp’s 
contact with the pronotum. Clearly, such escape respons-
es have greater efficacy than those in response to closure 
of the wasp’s jaws on the pronotum, at which time they 
are often too late. This interpretation is strengthened by 
the more common observation of a different class of es-
cape responses: those that occurred, with a slight delay, 
after the wasp’s jaws had closed on the pronotum (Fig. 6). 
Online supplementary Movie S2 clips 5–9 illustrate such 
escape responses, where no prior contact was evident 
during the wasp’s lunge. If not already triggered, an es-
cape response was always triggered when the wasp’s jaws 
closed on the pronotum.
Defense with Tibial Spines
Once the wasp has secured a hold on its pronotum, 
the cockroach still has a number of defenses at its dis-
posal. The most common behavior, observed in nearly 
every encounter that reached this stage, was the vigorous 
use of the spiny legs in a raking defense against the wasp. 
The utility of this defense was most obvious when the 
cockroach simply dislodged the wasp. Figure 7a illus-
trates this behavior schematically, showing the use of the 
midleg. In general, the cockroach pushed the leg against 
the wasp, securely lodging the spines against the wasp’s 
body and legs, and then simultaneously turned while 
moving its leg caudally. However, there were many vari-
ations, and the cockroaches used different legs, or com-
binations of legs, depending on the position of the wasp. 
Figure 7b and c illustrate 2 examples. Online supple-
mentary Movie S3 (clips 1–10) shows these 2 trials in 
 
full form, in addition to 8 other trials during which the 
cockroaches successfully dislodged the wasps using this 
strategy.
Even when the wasp was not dislodged, the legs – and 
the spiny tibiae in particular – could be used to lift the 
wasp’s abdomen (and stinger) away from its target, or to

hold it at bay using what might be called a “stiff-arm” de-
fense. Figure 8a illustrates this behavior schematically, 
showing the extended midleg and hind leg. Figure 8b 
shows an example of this behavior in a frame captured 
from a high-speed video (see online suppl. Movie S4, clip 
1). Often the wasp subsequently moved its abdomen to 
circumvent this obstruction. However, it was also possi-
ble for the tibial spines of the cockroach’s leg to lodge be-
tween some of the wasp’s abdominal segments during the 
struggle. An example is shown in Figure 8c. The involve-
ment of the front legs in this defensive behavior (e.g., on-
line suppl. Movie S5, clips 1 and 2) suggests the impor-
tance of sting 1 for the wasp, which would then allow for 
sting 2, into the brain, to happen without such interfer-
ence.
Finally, it should be noted that the tibial spines on the 
cockroach’s hindleg are much longer than those on the 
forelegs, and they could potentially pierce the soft tissue 
between the wasp’s abdominal segments. This possibility 
was explored with a dead wasp and a cockroach’s leg; in 
these circumstances, the tibial spines of the roach’s leg 
could be easily inserted between the wasp’s abdominal 
segments, piercing and deeply penetrating the underly-
ing connective tissue. How often this might occur in na-
ture is unknown, but it might help explain why wasps 
usually abort attacks when they grasp too far caudally, 
allowing the cockroach to effectively rake with its hind 
legs.
Biting
Although sting 1 temporarily paralyzes the front legs 
[Haspel et al., 2003], the cockroach can still bite. More-
over, depending on the particular position of the wasp’s 
grasp, while delivering sting 2, its abdomen must often 
be positioned close to the jaws. Figure 8d illustrates such 
an outcome with a frame captured from a high-speed 
video with the camera attached to a microscope. Online 
supplementary Movie S5 clip 4 shows this encounter,

and close inspection revealed a precarious situation for 
the wasp. The cockroach was able to lodge the spines of 
its forelimb under several of the wasp’s abdominal seg-
ments and then drew its leg forward along with the wasp’s 
abdomen. With its head turned and the jaws open, the 
cockroach managed to get the distal end of the wasp’s 
abdomen briefly within its jaws (arrow in online suppl. 
Movie S5, clip 4). Apparently, it was unable to secure a 
hold with its mandibles on the smooth cuticle of the 
wasp. But the encounter, along with similar observations 
(online suppl. Movie S5, clip 5), highlights the potential 
risk. These frequent attempts to bite the wasp likely ex-
plain why the wasp holds its unused legs up and distant 
from the cockroach’s head, presumably to keep them 
away from the jaws (Fig. 9). Finally, as reported by Fox 
et al. [2009], some cockroaches attempted to bite the 
wasp during the initial encounter (online suppl. Movie 
S5, clip 6).

and lodged the spines against the abdominal joint or along the ab-
domen, making it difficult for the wasp to sting. b Frame captured 
from a video showing the position of the midleg (red arrow) hold-
ing back the wasp’s abdomen. See online supplementary Movie S4

the tibial spines repeatedly against the wasp during the struggle

dominal segments. This provided purchase for pushing the abdo-
men and stinger away from the thorax. See online supplementary 
Movie S5 for this and additional examples. d Frame captured from

was apparently unable to damage the smooth, hard cuticle. See on-
line supplementary Movie S5 for this and other examples.

Discussion
Cockroaches and jewel wasps have been extensively 
studied to determine both general principles of neurobi-
ology and unique aspects of predator-prey interactions. 
For example, cockroaches have been used to investigate 
how a signal is extracted from noise when mechanosen-
sory cerci detect air movements, how air movement di-
rection is coded by the activity of giant neurons, and how 
afferents innervating tibial spines code the stimulus 
strength over time [French and Kuster, 1981], to mention 
just a few contributions. Parasitoid jewel wasps are also a 
compelling study system by virtue of their unique venom 
and hunting strategies, which allow them to alter host be-
havior with a sting to the brain. Each system is useful for 
both basic science and teaching. For the latter, cockroach-
es are tractable for many student laboratories in neurobi-
ology, whereas the ability of jewel wasps to “zombify” 
cockroaches provides a compelling framework for teach-
ing about animal behavior, neurotransmitters, and the 
coevolution of parasitoids and their hosts.
But there is a gap of sorts in our understanding of how 
these two species interact. Specifically, the American 
cockroach is renowned to both neurobiologists and 
homeowners as an escape artist; yet the jewel wasp man-
ages to sting this elusive target directly in the brain. How 
does the wasp manage to overcome the cockroach’s es-
cape mechanisms and potential defenses? This gap in our 
understanding is also a unique opportunity, because so 
much is already known about the biology of each species. 
Thus, new observations can be interpreted within the 
framework of numerous previous studies. And, in the 
spirit of the neuroethological approach, a more holistic 
understanding of the behavior of each species may be at-
tained by considering how previously described mecha-
nisms are put to use during a natural behavior – that is, 
what better way to study cockroach escape and defense 
than through the lens of a cockroach-hunting specialist?
The experimental approach was to examine these in-
teractions in slow motion, often at high magnification, to 
reveal details that are simply impossible to observe in real 
time or with the naked eye. The main finding was that 
cockroaches have a suite of defensive behaviors that can 
be used to successfully defend themselves from hunting 
wasps. Some of these behaviors provide a context for pre-
viously studied components of the cockroach’s sensory 
system (e.g., mechanosensory escape responses and tibial 
spine sensitivity), whereas others emphasize the utility of 
wasp behaviors (e.g., sting 1 paralyzes the front legs, 
thereby preventing the raking defense and stiff-arm block 
of the stinger during sting 2 in the throat). Before discuss-
ing the slow-motion, close-up interactions between the 
wasps and cockroaches, the efficacy of cockroach defens-
es is briefly recounted from the real-time trials.
Efficacy of Cockroach Defenses
One of the most obvious results is that many cock-
roaches put up a vigorous defense, and this greatly im-
proved their likelihood of survival. Only 14% of the cock-
roaches that did not put up an initial defense (while being 
stalked) avoided sting 1 within the first 3 min of the en-
counter (sting 1 always led to sting 2 in the real-time trials, 
and thus was scored as a failed defense). The cockroaches 
that survived without an initial defense were able to re-
move the wasp from the pronotum before sting 1 by rak-
ing with tibial spines. Subsequently, either they managed 
to defend themselves or the wasp did not attack again. In 
contrast, 63% of the cockroaches that put up an initial 
defense (as indicated by stilt-standing) avoided sting 1 
during the first 3 min.
Moreover, in numerous trials, wasps that encountered 
a stilt-standing and kicking cockroach seemed to give 
 
up the attack. Online supplementary Movie S7 clips 1–5 
show such examples. Often, the wasp was kicked multiple 
times in the head before it stopped stalking, suggesting 
the cockroach’s behavior deterred the wasp. In addition, 
some of the cockroaches actually approached the wasp in 
a defensive posture (e.g., online suppl. Movie S7, clip 2), 
perhaps adding to the deterrent effect by signaling their 
Fig. 9. Characteristic wasp posture during stinging. When deliver-
ing a sting, the wasps usually held their limbs up and away from 
the cockroach, in a pose reminiscent of a fencer. Presumably the 
similarity is in both form and function, as the wasp’s delicate legs 
might otherwise be damaged by the cockroach’s powerful jaws.

fitness. For the purposes of this study, a time period of 
 
3 min without a successful first sting was chosen to be 
scored as a successful defense, based on the premise that 
an uncontained, and unstung, cockroach in nature would 
eventually escape, particularly in cases during which the 
wasp gave up stalking for long intervals.
Of course, the cockroaches’ defenses often failed. Thus, 
it is also informative to consider trials during which the 
cockroach put up a strong defense, but the wasp pressed 
the attack and succeeded. Online supplementary Movie 
S8 includes the full sequence for such a case. The 2 min 
24 s interaction began with a stilt-standing cockroach that 
approached the wasp. The wasp in turn initially main-
tained its distance while continuously stalking the cock-
roach. The pronotum grasp was finally achieved when the 
wasp approached the right side of the cockroach – elicit-
ing a defensive posture oriented to the right – but then 
circled around to grasp the pronotum on the left side. 
Note that, in this regard, the pronotum on the undefend-
ed side is usually angled toward the substrate (Fig. 2g), 
thus – in contrast to the defended side – providing a par-
ticularly easy target. Although the defense ultimately 
failed, as pointed out by Gross [1993] any increase in han-
dling time can generally be considered beneficial to the 
host by providing more opportunities for escape.
The Stilt-Standing Defense
Stilt-standing was the hallmark of defensive behavior 
for the cockroaches. A review of the slow-motion interac-
tions revealed many advantages provided by stilt-stand-
ing. A somewhat theoretical advantage was the maximi-
zation of the apparent body size, not only by raising the 
body but also by turning lengthwise – a common defen-
sive strategy for prey attempting to deter a predator. But 
a more obvious advantage, specific to the jewel wasp at-
tack, was raising the pronotum away from the wasp and 
angling it toward the far side. This makes the wasp’s 
obligatory grasp on the horizontal edge of the pronotum 
much more difficult (e.g., Fig. 2g). In addition, stilt-
standing was an apparent requirement for defensive kick-
ing; no examples of kicking were observed in the absence 
of stilt-standing. This follows from the unusual style of 
the cockroach’s kick, which can be contrasted with those 
of crickets and grasshoppers. Unlike the latter, cock-
roaches do not depend on the stereotypic pre-kick flexion 
of the tibia at the knee joint followed by explosive exten-
sion, which in turn makes use of the caudal or outer sur-
face of the tibia for impact [Burrows and Wolf, 2002; Bur-
rows and Morris, 2003]. Instead, in cockroaches, the tibia 
was extended at the knee joint as the entire hind leg was 
drawn forward and up and then swept down and back 
through the target. This movement likely requires the 
space between the limb and the substrate that is provided 
by stilt-standing.
However, there is another critical advantage provided 
by stilt-standing. The cockroach is essentially “on guard,” 
with its antennae and tibial spines all positioned most fa-
vorably to detect the sudden lunge of an attacking preda-
tor. Note, in this regard, that Comer et al. [1994] have 
demonstrated short-latency, directional escape responses 
in P. americana in response to mechanosensory stimula-
tion of the antennae, legs, and pronotum. In addition, 
their experiments have indicated that small predators 
(spiders) do not generate sufficient airborne cues to acti-
vate a cercal (wind-receptor) escape response, which has 
a latency too long to account for the escapes from wasp 
lunges described in the present study [Schaefer et al., 
1994; Keasar et al., 2006]. The present results support 
their conclusions, as the high-magnification, slow-mo-
tion videos revealed multiple successful escapes that oc-
curred just after an antenna or tibial spines were deflected 
by a lunging wasp. These observations, in turn, are a tes-
tament to the selection of a high-speed escape circuitry, 
since a delay of only a few milliseconds would have re-
sulted in a successful wasp grasp in many of those trials 
(online suppl. Movie S2).
These results also highlight the utility of tibial spine 
mechanosensation, suggesting these organs play a key 
role in triggering escape responses (e.g., online suppl. 
Movie S2 and Fig. 5) and targeting defensive kicks (e.g., 
online suppl. Movie S1 and Fig. 4). The elicitation of ei-
ther a kick or an escape response is no doubt determined 
by the spine deflection rate, and therefore may provide 
some behavioral context for recordings of spine-afferent 
responses. In addition, stilt-standing cockroaches often 
actively probed with their hind leg when being stalked by 
a wasp and made contact just prior to kicking (online 
 
suppl. Movie S1). This use of the hind limb for active 
touch is a further testament to the role of mechanosensa-
tion in the cockroach’s defensive behaviors.
Additional Defenses
Once the wasp has successfully grasped the pronotum, 
the cockroach may still hold off the abdomen and dis-
lodge the wasp with its tibial spines and continue to de-
fend itself. In addition, the cockroach’s tibial spines some-
times lodge between the wasp’s abdominal segments dur-
ing the struggle (Fig. 8). These observations highlight the 
critical utility (for the wasp) of sting 1, which temporar-
ily paralyzes the cockroach’s front legs. It may be only

with great difficulty, and perhaps at great risk, that the 
wasp could manage sting 2 into the cockroach’s brain in 
the absence of sting 1, but after the wasp has stung the 
cockroach in the first thoracic ganglion, there is little 
hope of escape. Many cockroaches attempted to bite the 
wasp at this stage, but no evidence of damage to the wasp 
was observed in the present study. It seems likely that the 
smooth cuticle of the wasp’s abdomen has been selected 
for resistance to this attack, as has been suggested for the 
tarantula hawk’s cuticle, which seems generally impervi-
ous to the spider’s fangs [Petrunkevitch, 1926].
Conclusions
The results of this investigation reveal many new de-
tails on interactions between cockroaches and their arch-
enemy, the parasitoid jewel wasp. Many cockroaches de-
tected the wasp as it approached, and they were able to 
mount a successful defense by stilt-standing and kicking, 
or by removing the wasp with an escape response com-
bined with a raking defense with the tibial spines of the 
limbs. Although many studies have investigated the role 
of air movements for cockroaches’ predator detection, 
the present study emphasized the importance of mecha-
nosensation for cockroach defenses against relatively 
small attackers. Sudden contact with the tibial spines, 
pronotum, or antennae each resulted in short-latency es-
cape responses, whereas probing contact by the wasp elic-
ited violent kicking with the powerful, spiny hind limbs.
The results raise a number of interesting questions for 
further study. Are the defensive responses described here 
tailored to the jewel wasp’s attack? Is there an arms race 
of sorts between the attacking jewel wasp and the defend-
ing cockroach? Do cockroaches exhibit a different suite 
of defenses against other specific predators? Or are jewel 
wasps acting as classic “rare predators” [Dawkins, 1982], 
able to overcome a single suite of generalized defenses 
that evolved in cockroaches in response to a wide range 
of predators? How does the short-latency escape response 
to tibial spine stimulation fit into the cockroach’s neural 
circuitry [e.g., Ritzmann et al., 1991; Burdohan and Com-
er, 1996]? The accessibility of the cockroach as a study 
system may allow many of these questions to be addressed 
in future studies.
