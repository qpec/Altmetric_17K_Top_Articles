Abstract
The success of Mycobacterium tuberculosis as a human pathogen has been attributed to the ability of the bacillus to proliferate inside
macrophages and to induce cell death. This review describes how the sensors of the innate immune system modulate the cell death pathways in
infected macrophages and, consequently, the pathogenesis of tuberculosis.

1. Introduction
Tuberculosis (TB) remains a serious global health problem.
Nearly 9 million new annual cases of the disease and 1.5
million deaths per year were reported worldwide in 2013 [1].
Although the numbers of TB cases have progressively
declined in recent decades, an increment of 400,000 new cases
and 200,000 deaths was reported in the last year. The high
incidence of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection
and the increase in drug-resistant mycobacteria were impli-
cated to augment TB cases. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)
is typically transmitted by aerosolized droplets and reaches the
lungs, where the bacilli are phagocytized by alveolar macro-
phages, which are the main cell population in the front line of
host defense [2]. Inflammatory cells are recruited into the
lungs during the early infection and, in most cases, promote
non-sterile control of the bacilli. Therefore, mycobacterial
infection usually develops as a latent infection in which the
equilibrium between the bacillus and the host defense is
guaranteed by granuloma formation. The immune response
helps to control the proliferation of mycobacteria, but some
survive in the intragranulomatous necrotic masses formed as a
result of macrophage death. The reactivation of latent TB in
immunocompetent individuals occurs at rates that range from
3% to 10% per lifespan [3], and these rates are greatly
increased under immunosuppressive conditions caused by HIV
co-infection [2,4] or by therapy with anti-Tumor Necrosis
Factor (TNF)-a or interleukin (IL)-12/IL-23 blockers [4,5]. In
fact, the unbalance of the immune response can compromise
the control of Mtb and lead to the development of active TB
[5,6].
The hallmark of TB reactivation is the failure of the host
immune response to restrain the bacterial growth, inducing
new rounds of macrophage necrotic death and an increase in
granulomatous lesions, as a result of the recruitment of in-
flammatory cells [7,8]. In the aggressive cases of pulmonary
TB, the exacerbation of necrotic cell death leads to extensive

 caseous lesions and, in consequence, to the rupture of granu-
lomas into airways as well as the cavitation and dissemination
of mycobacteria [9]. Massive tissue damage compromises the
physiological function of the lungs and culminates in respi-
ratory failure and patient death. In recent years, the molecular
mechanisms involved in the death of infected macrophages
and the development of necrotic lesions have begun to be
elucidated [10e14]. This information is critical for the
development of adjunctive therapeutic approaches aimed at
decreasing TB-induced necrosis and improving disease out-
comes. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge
about the signaling pathways of the innate immune system that
modulate the death of infected macrophages during TB.
2. Cell death programs involved in the pathogenesis of TB
The death of macrophages following Mtb infection plays a
crucial role in the pathogenesis of TB. The cytotoxic activity
of mycobacteria in heavily infected macrophages allows their
dissemination and, consequently, disease progression. On the
other hand, the sensing of the intracellular bacilli by macro-
phages at the initial stage of infection can trigger host cell
death. These cell death processes may anticipate the destruc-
tion of infected cells and, therefore, contribute to mycobac-
terial control. For decades, apoptosis was considered to be the
only type of programmed cell death with important functions
in the physiology of multicellular organisms. Nevertheless,
recent efforts to understand how cells die during biological
processes (infectious or not) revealed other host programs of
cell death, e.g., pyroptose, pyronecrosis, necroptose and
ETosis or NETosis. It has been proposed that macrophage
necrosis facilitates the spread of mycobacteria [10,11,15,16],
whereas the activation of the apoptotic program contributes to
bacillus control [11,14,16]. However, although apoptosis
seems to be a good way to eliminate mycobacteria, some
studies do not support the apoptotic antimicrobial effect and
suggest that this process promotes macrophage deactivation
and consequent bacillus growth and dissemination [17,18]. In
fact, the particularities of different types of cell death in the
outcome of TB are only beginning to be elucidated.
2.1. Apoptotic cell death
Apoptosis is a non-inflammatory type of cell death in which
the fragmented nuclear and cytoplasmic contents of dying
cells are surrounded by membrane-bound vesicles called
apoptotic bodies [19]. The neighboring phagocytic cells engulf
the apoptotic bodies by a process called efferocytosis and
produce anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as Transforming
Growth Factor-b (TGF-b) and IL-10 [20]. Apoptotic cell death
is characterized by the activation of caspases-3, -7, -8, -9 and
-10; cell shrinkage; chromatic condensation; nuclear frag-
mentation; plasma membrane phospholipid flip-flop; and
plasma membrane blebbing [20e22]. Three distinct molecular
pathways can induce the apoptotic process, namely, extrinsic,
intrinsic and perforin/granzyme apoptosis. The extrinsic
pathway is triggered by ligand binding to TNF receptor
(TNFR) family proteins, e.g., TNFR1 (CD120a) and FAS
(CD95), which contain a death domain in their cytoplasmic
portion that promotes the activation of initiator caspases (8, 9
and 10) and then executioner caspases (3 and 7) [22,23]. The
activation of executioner caspases leads to the cleavage of a
large spectrum of death substrates that result in DNA frag-
mentation. In the intrinsic pathway, intracellular stress results
in mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP)
and the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol. Cytochrome c
binds to the cytosolic protein Apoptotic Protease Activating
Factor-1 (Apaf-1) and promotes the subsequent replacement of
Apaf-1-associated ADP by deoxy-ATP/ATP, which triggers
the formation of a multimeric signaling complex called the
apoptosome [24,25]. The recruitment and cleavage of pro-
caspase-9 by the apoptosome activates the executioner cas-
pases [21,25]. The B cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) family, a large
multigene family that inhibits (e.g., Bcl-2) or induces (e.g.,
Bcl-2 Interacting Mediator of Cell Death e Bim) apoptosis,
regulates the mitochondrial pathway [26]. The release of
perforin and granzyme B from the granules of cytotoxic T
lymphocytes and natural killer cells triggers the third apoptotic
pathway. Perforin creates a pore on the plasma membrane of
target cells and allows granzyme B to access the cytosol.
Granzyme B cleaves the initiator and executioner caspases
[27,28].
Several reports show that Mtb induces apoptotic cell death
by extrinsic and intrinsic pathways [16,29,30]. Upregulation of
pro-apoptotic genes, such as TNF-a, Fas, Fas ligand, Bim and
caspase-3, -5, -7 and -8 [29,31,32], is observed after Mtb
infection. Mtb-induced apoptotic gene activation results in
elevated levels of DNA fragmentation [15]; capase-3, -8 and -9
activation [29,32,33]; and, consequently, increased annexin V
staining in macrophages [34]. Interestingly, virulent myco-
bacteria are able to modulate the apoptotic cell death through
the downregulation of pro-apoptotic genes [30,35].
2.2. Necrotic cell death
Various factors external to cells or tissues, such as in-
fections, toxins or injuries, result in necrotic cell death. Ne-
crosis
is
an
inflammatory
type
of
cell
death
that
is
characterized by the swelling of the cell and organelles
accompanied by the loss of plasma membrane integrity and
release of cytoplasm and nuclear contents [36]. Consequently,
a large amount of damage-associated molecular patterns
(DAMPs) is released in the extracellular milieu. The sensing of
DAMPs by structural and resident cells (e.g., endothelial and
immunological cells) triggers inflammatory and reparatory
responses. Conventionally, necrotic cell death is a passive
process that develops without the cellular machinery. How-
ever, the discovery of necroptosis showed that cells could
execute a necrotic cell death program. This process was
originally defined as a backup defense mechanism against
viruses that ensures the elimination of infected cells by
TNFR1 and TNFR2 signaling in the presence of viral caspase-
8 inhibitors [37,38]. The immunogenicity of necroptosis helps
to target pathogens by the immune system. This process

death, Microbes and Infection (2015), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micinf.2015.09.005
 depends on the formation of a molecular complex called the
necrosome, which contains Receptor-Interacting Protein Ki-
nase 1 (RIPK1), RIPK3, Fas-Associated protein with Death
Domain (FADD) and inactive caspase-8 [39]. The necroptosis
is initiated by the phosphorylation of RIPK1 and RIPK3 and
the recruitment of Mixed Lineage Kinase domain-Like
(MLKL) [40]. Several events mediate this process, including
the depletion of NADþ and ATP, overload of Ca2þ, dysregu-
lation of the redox status, induction of reactive oxygen species
(ROS) and the presence of active phospholipases [41e43].
The final outcome of necroptosis is cellular osmotic swelling,
energetic breakdown, lipid peroxidation and lysosomal mem-
brane permeabilization (LMP), which results in the leakage of
digestive enzymes [39]. It is possible that the large amount of
TNF-a secreted during Mtb infection [44,45] is able to switch
apoptosis to necroptosis, especially if the mycobacteria were
able to secrete a caspase-8 blocker like other pathogens.
Supporting this idea, a rapid induction of macrophage nec-
roptosis and consequent bacillus dissemination was observed
in a condition of excess of TNF-a and ROS through a RIPK1/
RIPK3-dependent pathway [46]. However, an atypical necrotic
cell death was also described following macrophage infection
with
virulent
mycobacteria
[47],
which
was
RIPK1-
independent after stimulation with the Channel protein with
necrosis-inducing Toxin (CpnT) of Mtb [48].
Other types of programmed cell death that are akin to ne-
crosis, such as pyroptosis, pyronecrosis and ETosis or NETo-
sis, are associated with inflammation. The formation of the
inflammasome complex mediates both pyroptosis and pyro-
necrosis, leading as a final outcome to the production of the
inflammatory cytokines IL-1b and IL-18 and the induction of
cell lysis upon the disruption of the cellular ionic gradient
[49]. The general structure of inflammasomes includes Nod-
Like Receptors (NLRs) that interact with caspase-1 directly
or via an adaptor protein called Apoptosis-associated Speck-
like (ASC) containing a Caspase Activation and Recruitment
Domain (CARD). CARDeCARD interactions facilitate the
activation of pro-caspase-1, which is enhanced by the rapid
formation of a perinuclear structure named ASC-speck [50].
Pyroptosis is dependent on the activation of caspases-1 and
recently, caspase-11 was also implicated [49,51]. In contrast,
pyronecrosis
requires
lysosomal
cathepsin
B
and
inflammasome-component
ASC,
but
is
independent
of
caspases-1 [49,52]. Furthermore, the ASC speck that is
released during pyroptosis and pyronecrosis can activate sur-
rounding immune cells and perpetuate inflammatory responses
[50]. By using deficient macrophages or specific inhibitors
during Mtb infection, it was observed that atypical necrotic
cell death occurs independently of cathepsin B (required for
pyronecrosis) [47,53] and caspase-1/11 (required for pyrop-
tosis) [47,53,54]. Undoubtedly, it is difficult to know the exact
dependence of those molecules on the induction of certain
types of cell death, because the cell death type may vary
depending on several factors, such as the “burst size” of
intracellular bacteria loads, bacterial preparation (opsonized or
not), time-course of infection, bacterial virulence and host
cell type.
NETosis was first described in neutrophils during an
infection context, but a similar phenomenon was observed in
various innate immune cell types and named ETosis [49,55].
During this process, the release of chromatin into the extra-
cellular space leads to the formation of extracellular traps
called NETs (Neutrophil Extracellular Traps) or ETs. Due to
electrostatic interactions, unfolded DNA binds to the pathogen
and also to elastases, histones and antimicrobial peptides,
which facilitate the killing of the pathogen [56]. Additionally,
these traps may contribute to tissue damage exacerbation and
aggravate the diseases as a result of nuclear, granular and
plasma membranes bursts [57]. During Mtb infection, it has
been shown that NETs bind to heat shock protein 72 (Hsp72)
and then promote macrophage activation, resulting in the in-
duction of the early innate immune response [58]. However,
Mtb bacilli are resistant to the microbicidal effect of these
traps [59,60].
3. Mycobacterial infection sensing that is implicated in
macrophage death
Mycobacterial infection sensing by the innate immune
system modulates the cell death pathways in infected macro-
phages and, consequently, the pathogenesis of TB. Macro-
phages have a long lifespan that allows several cycles of
intracellular multiplications of Mtb bacilli. The recognition of
mycobacteria by the innate immune system is performed by
Pattern-Recognition Receptors (PRRs), including Toll-Like
Receptor (TLR)-2, TLR-4, TLR-8 and TLR-9 [61,62]; C-
type Lectin Receptors (CLRs), such as dectin-1, mannose re-
ceptor and Dendritic Cell-Specific Intercellular Adhesion
Molecule-3-Grabbing
Non-Integrin
(DC-SIGN);
NLRs
[2,63,64]; and Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING)
[65e67]. Additionally, complement receptors (CRs), such as
CR-1, CR-3 and CR-4; Fc receptors; and scavenger receptors
are implicated in mycobacterial recognition and endocytosis
[45]. Genetic mutations that impair the function of PRRs or
molecules that are required for their downstream signaling
generally increase the susceptibility and severity of TB in
humans, a phenomenon that is also observed in genetically
modified mouse models [2,45]. Among the TLRs, TLR-2 has a
critical role in the sensing of mycobacteria by the innate im-
mune system. TLR-2 can form heterodimers with both TLR-1
and TLR-6, which are expressed on the plasma membrane of
macrophages, neutrophils, DCs and lymphocytes. TLR-2-
deficient mice are susceptible to mycobacteria and develop
exacerbated inflammatory responses to infection [61,68].
TLR-2 recognizes mycobacterial glycolipids, such as lip-
oarabinomannan (LAM), lipomannan (LM), 19-kDa glyco-
protein
(also
known
as
LpqH
or
19-kDa
lipoprotein),
phosphatidylinositol mannoside (PIM), triacylated and diacy-
lated lipoprotein, as well as the Early Secreted Antigenic
Target of 6 kDa (ESAT-6) protein [62,69]. TLR-2 also senses
High-Mobility Group Box 1 (HMGB-1) [70], a non-histone
nuclear protein that is released from necrotic cells and also
it is found at high concentration in the serum during latent and
active TB [71]. The sensing of HMGB-1 by TLR-2 induces

 macrophage apoptosis in certain circumstances [72], and it is
likely that this phenomenon might occur during Mtb infection.
TLR-4 also recognizes Mtb antigens, such as heat shock
protein [73], MT 50S ribosomal protein [74] and 38-kDa
glycoprotein [75]. TLR-9 is found in endosomes and phag-
osomes where it senses mycobacterial DNA after bacillus
uptake together with TLR-2 [61]. The macrophage activation
triggered by TLR-2, TLR-4 and TLR-9 signaling requires the
engagement of an adaptor protein named Myeloid Differen-
tiation Primary Response Gene 88 (MyD88). Holscher and
colleagues showed that mice deficient in MyD88 are highly
susceptible to Mtb infection, displaying more vulnerability to
infection than TLR2/4/9�/� mice. These results suggest the
importance of MyD88 signaling to host defense against Mtb,
indicating an additional role of MyD88 besides TLR-driven
host protection [76].
TLR engagement initiates a downstream signaling cascade
that culminates in the production of cytokines and lipid me-
diators and modulates direct or indirectly the macrophage
death during Mtb infection. TLR-2 is implicated in Mtb-
induced apoptosis of macrophages through a molecular
pathway dependent on caspase-8 and independent of caspase-9
[69]. Following recognition of the 19-kDa glycoprotein from
Mtb, TLR-2 translocates to lipid rafts and induces macrophage
apoptosis through extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways
[69,77,78]. Another mycobacterial antigen that activates
apoptotic cell death through TLR-2 signaling is ESAT-6 [31].
Theoretically, TLR signaling can directly trigger the apoptotic
pathway through the binding of MyD88 to FADD protein [79].
Alternatively, mycobacterial antigen recognition by TLRs
leads to the production of cytokines and lipid mediators, which
may modulate indirectly macrophage death induction. The
production of lipid bodies and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) by
macrophages depends on the mycobacterial recognition by
TLR-2 and the scavenger receptor CD36 [77]. Additionally,
IL-1b has been implicated in the induction of PGE2 during
Mtb infection [10]. TLR-4 signaling by Mtb antigens upre-
gulates IRF3, leading to the induction of type 1 IFNs [80],
which may interfere in the balance between apoptotic and
necrotic cell death [10,72]. Moreover, the cytosolic surveil-
lance pathway also participates in the induction of type I IFNs
in Mtb-infected macrophage cultures through a mechanism
dependent on STING and IRF3 [66,67].
NLRs are cytosolic PRRs that sense intracellular myco-
bacterial compounds and mediate TLR-independent macro-
phage activation [81]. The “basis” of the molecule is formed
by the nucleotide-binding domain, named NACHT (NAIP,
CIITA, HET-E and TP-1) or NOD (nucleotide oligomerization
domain). NLRs are divided into 4 subfamilies based on the N-
terminal
domain
portion:
NLRA
(acidic
transactivating
domain), NLRB (BIR e Baculovirus Inhibitor of Apoptosis
(IAP)-Like Repeat e domain), NLRC (CARD domain) and
NLRP (Pyrin domain). Among NLRCs, NOD-1 and NOD-2
recognize peptidoglycan motifs from bacterial cell walls.
Additionally, NOD-2 is a sensor of intracellular muramyl
dipeptide (MDP) that is found in Streptococcus pneumonia
and Mtb [82]. NOD-1 and NOD-2 signaling induces RIPK2
activation and promotes the nuclear translocation of Nuclear
Factor kappa B (NF-kB), culminating in the production of
proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-a and IL-1b [83].
Although NOD-1 and NOD-2 overexpression and increased
RIPK2 activity enhance apoptotic cell death [84], NOD-2
activation by MDP or heat-killed Mtb leads to apoptosis
resistance in infected macrophages and facilitates Mtb survival
[85]. Despite this, the cytokines that are produced after NOD-1
and NOD-2 signaling are involved in macrophage activation
and death. NLRP3 is another protein belonging NLR family
that senses Mtb [86], leading to the release of bioactive IL-1b
[86e88]. IL-1b is synthesized as a pro-cytokine that is cleaved
by an enzymatic process mediated by NLRP3-inflammasome
activation during Mtb infection in vitro [86]. A growing
body of evidence shows that host and pathogen factors may
contribute to inflammasome activation [88]. Namely, the
generation of bioactive IL-1b in Mtb-infected macrophages
depends on ROS production and the lysosomal activation of
cathepsins [89]. Additionally, ESAT-6 seems to be a major
Mtb antigen that stimulates the release of bioactive IL-1b [86].
This antigen facilitates mycobacterial escape from the phag-
osome to the cytosol by mediating pore formation in the
phagolysosome membrane [90]. It is possible that ESAT-6-
mediated pore formation results in cytosol perturbation,
which could induce ROS production, Kþ efflux and lysosome
leakage. Despite the requirement of NLRP3 in vitro for IL-1b
production and macrophage death modulation, its involvement
in macrophage death induction during Mtb infection in vivo is
still unclear [53,54,87,91].
4. Inflammatory mediators that modulate macrophage
death
Some inflammatory mediators that are mainly produced by
innate immune cells can modulate the death of Mtb-infected
macrophages in an autocrine and/or paracrine manner. TNF-
a is thought to be a major cytokine for granuloma formation
[92,93]. The importance of TNF-a during mycobacterial
infection was evidenced by the increased susceptibility of
mice deficient in TNF-a or TNFR1 to mycobacteria [92,93].
Accordingly, the clinical use of anti-TNF antibodies (e.g.,
infliximab and adalimumab) enhanced the incidence of gran-
ulomatous infectious diseases, including TB [94,95]. TNF-a is
recognized by two distinct cell surface receptors, TNFR1 and
TNFR2. Although the extracellular portions of these receptors
show significant homology, only TNFR1 contains a death
domain in the cytoplasmic region. Therefore, TNFR1 induces
both cell activation and death, whereas TNFR2 promotes only
cell activation. TNFR1 and TNFR2 can also be found as sol-
uble receptors after enzymatic processing, acting as a TNF-a
blocker [96]. Balcewicz-Sablinska and colleagues observed
that the virulent H37Rv Mtb strain causes less apoptosis than
the avirulent H37Ra Mtb strain [44]. Although both myco-
bacterial strains induced the production of comparable levels
of TNF-a by alveolar macrophages, TNF-a bioactivity was
lower in the supernatants of macrophages infected with the
virulent strain. This discrepancy is associated with high levels
4

death, Microbes and Infection (2015), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micinf.2015.09.005
 of soluble TNFR2 in the supernatants of macrophages infected
with the virulent strain, which is considered to be an important
mechanism of mycobacterial evasion [97]. The expression of
TNFR1 in alveolar macrophages infected with virulent and
avirulent Mycobacterium bovis (Mbv) also correlates with the
induction of apoptosis [35]. In this case, the virulent strain
induces a lower expression of TNFR1 and causes less
apoptosis [35]. Nevertheless, the excess of TNF-a induces
high levels of ROS through a RIPK1/RIPK3-dependent
pathway and leads to the rapid induction of necroptosis and
consequent bacillus dissemination [46].
The modulation of cytokine production and lipid-derived
signaling molecules, such as eicosanoids, may also compro-
mise host resistance to infection. Recently, it was demon-
strated that the dynamic among IL-1b, PGE2 and type 1 IFNs
expression is crucial for bacterial control. The production of
type 1 IFNs also affects macrophage death during Mtb
infection. Mycobacterial strains that present a hypervirulent
profile stimulate the secretion of large amounts of type I IFNs
and induce necrotic cell death [45,98]. Although IFN-g is
critical for mouse resistance to TB, type I IFNs can negatively
regulate host defenses [99]. Accordingly, mice deficient in the
IFN-a/b receptor are resistant to mycobacteria [10,45]. Type I
IFNs may subvert anti-TB host defenses by inhibiting the
production of pro-inflammatory mediators, such as IL-12, IL-
1b and iNOS, and by inducing anti-inflammatory mediators,
such as IL-10 and IL-1R antagonist (IL-1Ra) [45,100].
Additionally, in the absence of type I IFN signaling, increased
levels of PGE2 and IL-1b and reduced levels of IL-1Ra are
found in bronchoalveolar lavages from mice infected with
H37Rv Mtb [10]. Prostaglandins, resolvins, lipoxins and leu-
kotrienes are lipid mediators that are derived from arachidonic
acid
metabolism
[101].
The
enzymes
cyclooxygenase-2
(COX-2) and 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) or 12/15-lipoxygenase
(12/15-LO) compete with each other for arachidonic acid to
generate COX-dependent prostaglandins or LO-dependent
lipoxins and leukotrienes. Mice deficient in 5-LO are resis-
tant to Mtb infection, while Ptgs2�/� mice are susceptible to
TB, suggesting that the balance of lipid mediators may affect
the outcome of disease [10,102,103]. Accordingly, the aviru-
lent H37Ra Mtb strain stimulates the release of large amounts
of PGE2 by infected macrophages, while the virulent H37Rv
Mtb strain induces less PGE2 and more lipoxin A4 (LXA4)
[103,104]. These studies also show a balance towards
apoptotic cell death in experimental conditions where PGE2 is
higher than LXA4, while massive macrophage necrosis occurs
when LXA4 predominates. Furthermore, the stimulation of
H37Rv-infected macrophages with exogenous PGE2 inhibits
necrotic death, while H37Ra-infected macrophages that are
treated with LXA4 die by necrosis [10,14]. PGE2 may inhibit
necrotic cell death by promoting plasma membrane repair, a
fundamental process that prevents the dissemination of
mycobacteria and facilitates their killing [14,104]. Mayer-
Barber and colleagues also showed that IL-1R signaling is
crucial to induce COX-2 and, consequently, to generate the
PGE2, which is required to subvert necrotic cell death, leading
to mouse protection against mycobacteria [10].
5. Sensing of extracellular ATP in aggressive forms of TB
Murine models of TB have been extremely useful to
characterize the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of
the disease and in the generation of protective immunity.
However, determining the factors responsible for the devel-
opment of lung necrosis is problematical because this process
is atypical in mice infected with virulent mycobacteria, such
as the H37Rv strain. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms
behind the development of severe TB, our research group
established murine models based on the infection of C57BL/6
mice with a low dose of hypervirulent mycobacterial strains
[11,105]. The Beijing 1471 Mtb strain and MP287/03 Mbv
strain induce extensive pulmonary inflammation and necrosis
and promote bacillus dissemination and mouse death [11].
These experimental models were used to determine whether
the innate immune response to damage signals could aggravate
the disease.
Intracellular ATP is an energy source for physiologic cell
function. ATP is also released by necrotic cells as a result of
plasma membrane permeabilization as well as by apoptotic
cells through pannexin-1 hemichannels [106]. Extracellular
ATP is a potent damage signal for immune cells and con-
tributes to inflammatory and reparatory responses [107,108].
Among the purinergic receptors that recognize ATP, the P2X7
receptor (P2X7R) is uniquely implicated in the induction of
pro-inflammatory cytokine production and cell death [109].
P2X7R engagement allows the influx of Ca2þ and efflux of
Kþ, culminating in the cytosol ionic disturbance that triggers
the NLRP3-inflammasome and promotes the release of active
IL-1b [110]. The prolonged stimulation of P2X7R leads to the
formation of large transmembrane pores and the flux of
macromolecules. The magnitude and duration of the stimulus
determine whether P2X7R activation induces apoptotic or
necrotic cell death [111]. Additionally, several reports have
highlighted the importance of P2X7R in the outcome of sterile
and infectious inflammation in different experimental models
[11,112].
Our recent study showed that extracellular ATP stimulation
has opposite outcomes in macrophages that are infected with
virulent or hypervirulent mycobacteria [11]. It has been pre-
viously shown that P2X7R engagement in macrophages
infected with avirulent BCG promotes phagolysosome fusion
and induces apoptotic cell death, thereby causing mycobac-
terial killing [113]. Accordingly, loss-of-function P2X7R
polymorphisms in human macrophages exhibit ablated ATP-
induced apoptosis and ATP-mediated killing of BCG bacilli
[114,115]. We observed that extracellular ATP induces the
P2X7R-mediated killing of H37Rv Mtb bacilli and the
P2X7R-mediated release of viable Beijing 1471 Mtb and
MP287/03 Mbv bacilli. Hypervirulent mycobacteria also show
resistance to intracellular killing in IFN-g stimulated macro-
phages [116,117], and that resistance can be attributed to the
ability of pathogenic mycobacteria to block phagolysosome
fusion [118]. Additionally, the comparison of the disease
progression in C57BL/6 and P2X7R�/� mice infected with a
low dose of H37Rv Mtb, Beijing 1471 Mtb and MP287/03

 Mbv bacilli allowed us to describe the crucial role of P2X7R
in the aggressive forms of pulmonary TB [11]. Our findings
provide a new insight into the pathogenesis of severe TB by
showing that mice that lack P2X7R have attenuated disease
with substantially reduced bacillus burdens in the lungs, livers
and spleens. The absence of P2X7R also promotes significant
reductions in pneumonia and lung necrosis in mice infected
with hypervirulent mycobacteria, which corroborates our hy-
pothesis of DAMP involvement in the pathogenesis of severe
TB. Both, a moderate extent of tissue damage, which results in
small amounts of extracellular ATP release, and a suscepti-
bility to ATP-induced intracellular killing, explain the lack of
involvement or the protective role of P2X7R in mice infected
with H37Rv Mtb bacilli [119]. Finally, loss-of-function poly-
morphisms in the human P2X7R gene have been associated
with an increased risk of pulmonary TB [120,121]. However,
there has not been a consensus in the field regarding this issue,
and other studies show a lack of association between these
parameters [122,123]. We proposed that the heterogeneity of
the samples analyzed in these studies resulted in the failure to
reach a consistent conclusion [11]. Namely, the loss-of-
function polymorphisms in the P2X7R gene may enhance
the risk of pulmonary TB for mild TB and reduce the risk of
severe TB. Additionally, the protective role of the P2X7R
functional deficiency in aggressive TB could explain why
these gene polymorphisms were maintained at high rates in the
human population. Thus, tissue damage generated through
eATP recognition by P2X7R might be a good target for the
development of new therapeutic approaches to ameliorate the
exacerbation
of
infection,
avoiding
widespread
necrotic
macrophage death and bacillus dissemination.
6. Concluding remarks
This review summarizes how the sensors of the innate
immune system define the macrophage fate during mycobac-
terial infection, modulating the type of cell death. Mycobac-
terial
recognition
by
infected
macrophages
can
trigger
Fig. 1. The signaling pathways that modulate the macrophage death. Mycobacterial sensing by PRRs induces inflammatory mediators, which regulate the infected
macrophage death. TNF-a induces both apoptosis and necroptosis. The induction of necroptosis via TNF-a supposedly occurs when caspase-8 is inhibited. IL-1b
enhances the production of TNF-a that induces apoptosis. Also, IL-1b impairs the necrotic cell death through generation of PGE2, which promotes plasma
membrane repair and apoptotic cell death. On the other hand, type 1 IFNs block IL-1b production via IL-10 and IL-1Ra induction and LXA4 generation,
facilitating the necrotic cell death. Additionally, the rapid intracellular growth of hypervirulent mycobacteria results in massive macrophage damage. The eATP
released by necrotic cells engage the P2X7R on their surfaces or on neighboring cells. P2X7R signaling cooperates with mycobacterial components exhibiting the
membrane-lysing activity and accelerates the necrotic death of infected macrophages. On the other hand, low amounts of eATP induce apoptotic cell death by a
mechanism dependent on P2X7R activation. This process is observed during infection with avirulent/virulent mycobacteria. Thus, apoptosis induction of infected
macrophages favors mycobacterial killing, whereas necrotic cell death facilitates the spread of the bacilli.

 different programs of cell death and also induce the secretion
of inflammatory mediators (Fig. 1). As a general concept,
apoptotic cell death is thought to be a host strategy to elimi-
nate the mycobacteria, whereas necrotic cell death is consid-
ered to be a pathogen strategy to promote its dissemination.
However, in certain circumstances, macrophage apoptosis fa-
cilitates bacillus spread, and the host programs of necrosis
help to target pathogens by the immune system. Therefore,
additional efforts are needed to exactly determine the relative
contributions of the different molecular pathways that antici-
pate macrophage death during TB. Furthermore, inflammatory
mediators are fundamental for modulating the macrophage
fate and might drive apoptotic or necrotic cell death. The
dynamic between these processes is fascinating from the point
of view of host/pathogen co-evolution. Both pathogen and host
are under evolutionary pressure that selects the best charac-
teristics for their survival and perpetuation over generations.
The failure of the host immune response to protect against Mtb
infection leads to the induction of necrotic macrophage death,
which might be deleterious for the host by causing a pro-
gressive disease and tissue damage that allows the spread of
the mycobacteria. Understanding the molecular mechanisms
of this process may open new perspectives to develop
adjunctive therapeutic approaches to subvert necrotic cell
death and avoid bacillus dissemination, thereby preventing the
fatal outcome of severe TB.
