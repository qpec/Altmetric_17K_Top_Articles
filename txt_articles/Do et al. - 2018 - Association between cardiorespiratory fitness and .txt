Abstract
Background: Previous literature suggests the beneficial effects of fitness on abdominal obesity may be attenuated
in obesity and abolished in severe obesity. It is unclear whether the beneficial association between fitness and
health is similarly present in those with mild and severe obesity.
Methods: Patients from the Wharton Medical Clinic (n = 853) completed a clinical examination and maximal
treadmill test. Patients were categorized into fit and unfit based on age- and sex-categories and body mass
index (BMI) class (mild: ≤ 34.9 kg/m2, moderate: 35–39.9 kg/m2 or severe obesity: ≥ 40 kg/m2).
Results: Within the sample, 41% of participants with mild obesity had high fitness whereas only 25% and
11% of the participants with moderate and severe obesity, respectively, had high fitness. BMI category was independently
associated with most of the metabolic risk factors, while fitness was only independently associated with systolic blood
pressure and triglycerides (P < 0.05). The prevalent relative risk for pre-clinical hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia
and hypoalphalipoproteinemia and pre-diabetes was only elevated in the unfit moderate and severe obesity
groups (P < 0.05), and fitness groups were only significantly different in their relative risk for prevalent pre-
clinical hypertension within the severe obesity group (p = 0.03). High fitness was associated with smaller waist
circumferences, with differences between high and low fitness being larger in those with severe obesity than
mild obesity (Men: P = 0.06, Women: P = 0.0005).
Conclusions: Thus, in contrast to previous observations, the favourable associations of having high fitness
and health may be similar if not augmented in individuals with severe compared to mild obesity.

Background
The fit-fat paradox has been the topic of investigation
for many years [1–5]. Specifically, it is suggested that
individuals with mild obesity and a high fitness may not
present with the typically expected negative health fac-
tors associated with obesity and may have lower risk of
mortality than their normal-weight unfit counterparts
[1–5]. The health benefits of having a high fitness are
thought to be in part due to reduced visceral obesity for
a given body mass index (BMI) [6]. However, the
decreased abdominal obesity associated with a high
fitness may be attenuated with higher levels of obesity,
and it is suggested that there may no differences in ab-
dominal obesity by fitness in individuals with moderate
and severe obesity [7]. Conversely, the potential benefi-
cial associations between high fitness and health may be
larger in severe obesity than milder obesity groups [6, 8],
perhaps due to the greater deterioration in health com-
monly observed in severe obesity classes. Populations
with moderate to severe obesity have increased in preva-
lence and have reached over 5% in Canada [9] but
remain a relatively understudied population. Thus, the
primary objective of this study is to determine the rela-
tionships between fitness and metabolic risk factors in
individuals with higher levels of obesity.

 Methods
Participants
The sample included 853 patients with obesity who
attended the Wharton Medical Clinic. Participants were
included if they underwent measurements of blood pres-
sure, general blood work and a standardized treadmill test
during their first 3 months of enrolling at the weight man-
agement
centre.
All
participants
provided
written
informed consent knowing their decision to participate
would not alter the care provided and that they could
withdraw consent at any time. York University Institu-
tional Review Board approved the study protocol used
(Certificates: 2013–123 and #e2017–166). The datasets
generated and analyzed during the current study are not
publicly available due to privacy laws associated with med-
ical data but are available with a data sharing agreement
as approved by the relevant institutional ethics committee
and the health information custodian (S. Wharton).
Clinical examination
Blood samples were obtained via venipuncture after at
least an 8 h fast to assess triglycerides, glucose, and high
density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol using standard
procedures by certified medical laboratories. Blood pres-
sure was measured manually at the clinic by trained
technicians. Preclinical hypertension was defined as
blood pressure ≥ 130/85 mmHg or use of hypertensive
medications. Preclinical hypertriglyceridemia was de-
fined as triglyceride > 1.7 mM or use of lipid medica-
tions. Preclinical hypoalphalipoproteinemia was defined
as HDL levels less than 1.0 mM in men or 1.3 mM in
women or use of lipid medications. Prediabetes was
defined as glucose ≥ 5.6 mM or use of diabetes medica-
tions. Waist circumference was measured at the mid-
point between the superior iliac spine and lowest rib
[10]. BMI was used to categorize obesity levels: mild:
BMI 30–24.9 kg/m2, moderate: BMI 35–39.9 kg/m2 and
severe: BMI ≥ 40 kg/m2 [11].
Maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) was estimated from
a graded multistage treadmill Bruce protocol. Treadmill
time was used to predict VO2max using sex-specific
equations [12, 13]. Participants were stratified by fitness
based on standard age- and sex- specific VO2max cutoffs:
unfit (< 20th percentile) or fit (≥ 20th percentile) [14].
Statistical analysis
ANOVA and chi-squared tests were used to determine
group differences in participant characteristics. Differ-
ences in health risk between mild, moderate or severe
obesity groups by fitness groups were assessed using
generalized linear models with obesity class (continuous
term) and fitness main effect and interaction terms
adjusting for age, sex and relevant medication use
(diabetes, lipid or blood pressure). When the interaction
term was not significant, the model was re-run without
the interaction term. When the interaction or obesity
group and/or fitness main effect was observed, the least
squared means were reported for the obesity-fitness
groups with least squared difference post hoc tests to
assess group differences.
The relative risk for prevalent preclinical risk factors
for the obesity and fitness groups was assessed using
main effects and interaction terms adjusting for age and
sex using the method proposed by Zou [15]. When the
interaction term was not significant, the model was re-
run without the interaction term. When the interaction
or obesity and/or fitness main effect was observed, a
least squared difference post hoc was conducted to as-
sess group differences. Analyses were performed using
SAS v9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
Results
Within the sample, 41% of participants with mild obesity
were fit whereas only 25% and 11% of the participants
with moderate and severe obesity, respectively, were
considered fit (Table 1). Individuals with high fitness
tended to be younger (47.6 vs 51.4 years), had a lower
BMI (35.8 vs. 41.1 kg/m2) and more likely to be female
(84.4 vs 75.9%, P < 0.05).
The mean blood pressure, glucose, triglycerides and HDL
adjusted by age and sex stratified by BMI and fitness cat-
egory are shown in Fig. 1. As expected, BMI category was
independently associated with most of the metabolic risk
factors, while fitness was independently associated with
SBP and triglycerides (P < 0.05). There were no significant
differences between fitness groups within a BMI category
(P > 0.05). Further, there were no significant differences be-
tween obesity groups within the fit category for any of the
metabolic variables (P < 0.05). Unfit, severe obesity groups
had significantly worse metabolic profiles as compared to
the fit mild obesity group (P < 0.05) and the unfit mild
obesity group (except triglycerides, P < 0.05).
Those with low fitness and higher obesity tended to
have a larger waist circumference (Fig. 2). There was a
significant BMI x fitness interaction, indicating that the
differences
in
waist
circumference
between
fitness
groups were greater in those with higher obesity classes
in men (P = 0.06) and women (P = 0.0005). However, the
difference in waist circumference between fitness groups
only attained significance in the moderate (Fit versus
Unfit: 112.1 versus 116.5 cm, P = 0.001) and severe (Fit
versus Unfit: 119.6 versus 129.2 cm, P < 0.0001) obesity
groups in women.
The prevalent relative risk for pre-clinical hyperten-
sion, hypertriglyceridemia and hypoalphalipoproteinemia
and pre-diabetes was only elevated in the unfit moderate
and severe obesity groups as compared to fit and unfit
groups with mild obesity (Fig. 3, P < 0.05). The only
Do et al. BMC Obesity  (2018) 5:5 
Page 2 of 6
 difference between fitness groups within a given BMI
category was in the relative risk for prevalent pre-clinical
hypertension within the severe obesity group (Fit versus
Unfit RR: 0.77, 0.59–0.99, p = 0.047).
Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate
that the association between fitness and health may be
similar if not augmented in individuals with severe obes-
ity as compared to mild obesity and extends previous
research done in populations with normal weight, over-
weight and mild obesity. Further, we suggest that these
differences in health risk by fitness may be related with
differences in waist circumference.
High fitness is commonly defined in the health lit-
erature as being in the top 80% of an age- and sex--
category as this is the threshold often reported as
being associated with the greatest gains in health ben-
efits [1, 2]. This means that the 10% prevalence of
high fitness observed in those with severe obesity is 8
times lower than what would be expected in the gen-
eral population. Within the present study, fitness was
predicted
using
symptom-limited
treadmill
testing.
Therefore, some individuals may have stopped due to
problems
such
as
musculoskeletal
pain
which
is
shown to be more likely in populations with obesity
[16] rather than cardiovascular fatigue. Also, certain
medications that are more prevalent in populations
with obesity, such as beta blockers, can influence
heart rate and blood pressure and increase the likeli-
hood
of
experiencing
early
cardiovascular
fatigue
during exercise [17]. Given that our sample com-
prised individuals with higher levels of obesity who
are likely to have more health problems, our ability
to accurately identify patients with high fitness may
have been reduced. Nevertheless, the concept that an
individual can present with high fitness despite severe
obesity is a novel observation that has important clin-
ical and public health implications.
Several studies have demonstrated a positive associ-
ation between obesity and metabolic risk factors, as well
as an inverse association between fitness and metabolic
risk [2, 3]. These observations are largely limited to
populations consisting of mainly normal weight, over-
weight and mild obesity [1, 2]. Borodulin et al. [8] and Lee
et al. [6] demonstrated that there was a stronger associ-
ation between CRF and systolic blood pressure with
increasing levels of adiposity. Conversely, data from the
Aerobics Centre Longitudinal Study suggest that the asso-
ciation between fitness and blood pressure may be weaker
in those with greater obesity [18]. We extend these
findings to demonstrate that the benefits of fitness for
most of the metabolic risk factors are similar for all
obesity classes. The lone exception was that those
with severe obesity, individuals who were fit were less
likely to have pre-clinical or clinical hypertension
than those were unfit.

 The health effects of fitness are suggested to be mediated
in part through the positive health benefits of engaging in
regular physical activity [2]. Physical activity has been
shown to improve fasting glucose by increasing the rate of
glucose uptake in skeletal muscle [19] and improve lipid
metabolism through increases in lipoprotein lipase in both
skeletal muscle and adipose tissue [20]. As individuals with
severe obesity are more likely to have deteriorations in
these metabolic risk factors, it may not be surprising that
the benefits of fitness may also extend to those with severe
obesity. Nevertheless, in our study and others [18, 21, 22],
obesity was more strongly associated with metabolic health
risk than fitness. However, it should be of note that within
the fit individuals, those with severe obesity did not have
significantly elevated glucose, blood pressure or lipids as
compared to those with mild obesity. This supports the po-
tentially important health benefits of having a high fitness
level, particularly for those with severe obesity.
The beneficial effects of fitness on health may also be at-
tributed to differences in abdominal obesity. Wong et al.
[5] report that in men the differences in visceral obesity
with high fitness are reduced with increasing BMI and
may be completely abolished at a BMI of ≥35 kg/m2. This
would suggest that the benefits of fitness should be
attenuated with those with moderate and severe obesity.
However, our results in women and to a lesser degree in
men, demonstrate that there was a greater difference in
waist circumference between fitness groups in the moder-
ate and severe obesity group than the mild obesity group:
an observation that mirrors our results for metabolic
health. These differences may in part steam from the sex
or other demographic differences between the ACLS and
WMC populations studied, but may suggest that fitness
may be particularly important for women with obesity.
However, these primary observations need further investi-
gation for confirmation.
The strengths and limitations of our study warrant
mention. Although this study used a larger sample size
with higher levels of obesity than previous studies, the
cross sectional design of our study does not allow us to
infer causality. Also, we were unable to adjust for other
factors such as physical activity, ethnicity, smoking sta-
tus, and education as these variables were not consist-
ently reported within our clinical population.

 population are of considerable public health importance.
We demonstrate that the benefits of fitness on metabolic
health appear similar if not augmented in those with
higher levels of obesity as compared to those with lower
levels of obesity. Thus, it may be equally if not more
important
to
promote physical
activity and fitness
behaviours to this increasingly prevalent group of indi-
viduals in order to obtain metabolic health benefits.
