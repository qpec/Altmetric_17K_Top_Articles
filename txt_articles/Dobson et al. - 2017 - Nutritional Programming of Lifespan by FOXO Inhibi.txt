SUMMARY
Consumption of unhealthy diets is exacerbating the
burden of age-related ill health in aging populations.
Such diets can program mammalian physiology
to cause long-term, detrimental effects. Here, we
show that, in Drosophila melanogaster, an unhealthy,
high-sugar diet in early adulthood programs lifespan
to curtail later-life survival despite subsequent die-
tary improvement. Excess dietary sugar promotes in-
sulin-like signaling, inhibits dFOXO—the Drosophila
homolog of forkhead box O (FOXO) transcription
factors—and represses expression of dFOXO target
genes encoding epigenetic regulators. Crucially,
dfoxo is required both for transcriptional changes
that mark the fly’s dietary history and for nutritional
programming of lifespan by excess dietary sugar,
and this mechanism is conserved in Caenorhab-
ditis elegans. Our study implicates FOXO factors,
the evolutionarily conserved determinants of animal
longevity, in the mechanisms of nutritional program-
ming of animal lifespan.
INTRODUCTION
Age is the main risk factor for a plethora of chronic human ill-
nesses (Niccoli and Partridge, 2012). Aging is influenced by
many parameters throughout the life of an individual, with most
variation in human lifespan attributable to environmental differ-
ences (Slagboom et al., 2011). Currently, one of the main envi-
ronmental insults on human health is the food we eat (Lustig
et al., 2012). Indeed, chronic diseases are on the rise globally,
due in part to aging populations (Christensen et al., 2009)
but also due to the increasing consumption of unhealthy diets
dominated by highly processed, low-cost foods (Dearden and
Ozanne, 2015; Lustig et al., 2012). For example, sugar consump-
tion has tripled over the last 50 years and is linked to a range of
detrimental health outcomes (Lustig et al., 2012). These condi-
tions underlie a pandemic of metabolic disorders, such as
obesity and diabetes, which amplify the disease burden of an
increasingly aged population.
An individual’s long-term adult health is influenced not only by
their current diet but also by dietary history. Persistent effects of
nutrition are termed nutritional programming, where a nutritional
stimulus triggers a structural change or a persistent physio-
logical state with long-term functional consequences (Lucas,
1998). In humans and other mammals, there is a wealth of epide-
miological and experimental evidence that both under- and over-
nutrition in early life can profoundly influence later-life health and
survival. Long-term effects arise during development, potentially
in early adulthood, and can be transmitted from parent to
offspring (Dearden and Ozanne, 2015; Fernandez-Twinn et al.,
2014; Gillman, 2005; Hardikar et al., 2015; Hirko et al., 2015;
Langley-Evans, 2006). Importantly, even small, persistent effects
can have important societal consequences due to the sheer
number of people consuming unhealthy diets (Lustig et al.,
2012). The molecular mechanisms that link past nutritional expe-
rience to curtailed survival and detrimental health outcomes
remain unclear.
Drosophila melanogaster is an important model in understand-
ing the interaction between nutrition and aging (Piper et al., 2011;
Simpson et al., 2015; Tatar et al., 2014). To be consistent with
their ecology, laboratory fruit flies are often fed a diet composed
of yeast (a protein source) and sugar (Bass et al., 2007). High-
protein diets shorten Drosophila lifespan (Lee et al., 2008; Par-
tridge et al., 1987; Skorupa et al., 2008), but the effects of protein
excess on mortality appear completely and rapidly reversible in
adult Drosophila (Mair et al., 2003), indicating that protein-
skewed diets do not program subsequent mortality (Mair et al.,
2003). However, some diet-induced physiological changes are
irreversible in the adult fly (van den Heuvel et al., 2014). In fruit
flies, increased mortality due to excessive dietary sugar con-
tinues after dietary change (Mair et al., 2005), whereas parental
sugar consumption enhances obese-like phenotypes in the
offspring (Buescher et al., 2013; O
¨ st et al., 2014). These studies
hint that sugar-rich diets can program Drosophila physiology and

 should be explored as a model of the mechanisms connecting
dietary history to aging.
Here, we show that consuming a diet high in sugar (sucrose) in
early adulthood curtails later-life survival in Drosophila through
nutritional programming. We show that sugar regulates the activ-
ity of the Drosophila forkhead box O (FOXO) transcription factor
(TF) to set up gene expression changes that mark the fly’s nutri-
tional history. We find that dfoxo is required to establish long-
term, detrimental effects of past excessive sugar consumption.
Importantly, this role of dfoxo is conserved in its Caenorhabditis
elegans ortholog, daf-16. Our findings reveal FOXO factors as a
mechanistic link between dietary history and later-life survival.
RESULTS
Excessive Sugar in Early Adult Fly Diet Curtails Survival
in Middle and Old Age
Can excess sugar in the adult diet program Drosophila survival?
We compared lifespans of wild-type, outbred female flies
that were continuously fed a diet containing sucrose concentra-
tion optimal for lifespan (5% sucrose, referred to as 13 sugar
[13S]; Bass et al., 2007) to that of their sisters, which were tran-
siently fed an 83 excess of sugar (83S) starting from day 2 of
adulthood (Figure 1A). 83S diet has both an increased caloric
value and skewed protein-to-carbohydrate ratio. We limited
treatment time to 3 weeks (a third of median life expectancy) to
circumvent premature mortality that results from consuming
this diet long term (Al Saud et al., 2015; Skorupa et al., 2008),
thus avoiding potential bias arising from selection of hardy indi-
viduals. Fewer than 10% of experimental flies died during treat-
ment (Figure 1B).
To evaluate the persistent, long-lasting effects of 83S diet, we
examined survival when all the flies were back on 13S food. We
found that the median lifespan of flies that had been fed 83S for
3 weeks was reduced (7%; Figure 1B). The effect could not be
attributed to changes in feeding after the exposure to 83S
food, because no differences in feeding or body mass were
observed after 1 week of recovery on 13S (Figures S1A and
S1B). Interestingly, excess sugar did not impact survival immedi-
ately after treatment but created a vulnerability to the effects of
age (Figure 1B). Statistical modeling using Cox proportional
hazards (CPHs) confirmed that the time spent on 83S before
23 days of age significantly increased the risk of death after
23 days (p < 2 3 10�16; Table S1). We noticed that different
treatment groups had different median but similar maximum life-
spans, prompting us to examine whether the effect of 83S de-
cayed with time. The increase in risk of death decayed with
time (p < 2 3 10�16; Table S1), implying either that the flies had
a heterogeneous response to sugar, potentially due to the ge-
netic variation in the outbred population, or that the effect of
83S feeding was slowly erased.
To ensure that the effect of 83S feeding was substantially long
term and to better estimate its magnitude, we examined the
demography of survival in middle and old age, between 40 and
80 days, by analyzing over 1,000 deaths. Having been exposed
to 83S in early adulthood significantly increased relative risk of
death in both mid-life (40–60 days interval) and late life (61–
80 days interval), with 3 weeks on 83S increasing the relative

 risk by �50% (Figure S1C). Notably, the magnitude of this effect
was comparable to the reported 91% increase in the relative, all-
cause mortality risk in middle-aged and older humans who were
obese as young adults independently of their BMI later in life
(Hirko et al., 2015). Hence, excess sugar consumption in early
adulthood has long-term detrimental effects in the fruit fly.
Such detrimental effects could be due to either programming
of fly physiology or accumulation of irreparable molecular dam-
age. We reasoned that, if damage caused the long-term effects
of sugar-rich diets in the first third of life, then feeding on a
healthy diet (13S) in the same period, before any major mortality
occurs, should be beneficial regardless of the subsequent diet
(Figure 1C). We found no evidence of improved survival after
feeding on 13S (Figures 1D, S1D, and S1E). This indicates
that, rather than cause irreparable damage, the relative amount
of sugar consumed in a fly’s early adulthood triggers a lasting
physiological change or program, which can be detrimental in
later life. In mammals, such persistent effects of nutrition are
referred to as nutritional programming (Lucas, 1998). Overall,
our data are consistent with nutritional programming of lifespan
by relative sugar levels encountered in early adulthood in
Drosophila.
Transcriptional Response to Sugar Implicates dFOXO
Next, we sought a regulatory mechanism whereby the 83S diet
programs lifespan. A proposed mechanism for mediating nutri-
tional programming is the regulation of gene expression (Barnes
and Ozanne, 2011; Niculescu and Lupu, 2011). We chose to
identify TFs responsive to 83S as candidates for mediating the
long-term effects of this diet. To explore the transcriptional
signature of sugar in Drosophila, we used RNA sequencing
(RNA-seq) to interrogate whole-body transcriptomes of females
fed 83S or 13S diet for 1 week, because any long-lasting pro-
grams must be a consequence of the changes occurring during
exposure to the diet. A total of 6,435 genes were differentially ex-
pressed on 83S (10% false discovery rate [FDR]; Figure 2; all
gene lists are given in Data S1). Interestingly, we found that the
promoters of genes repressed by 83S were enriched for fork-
head-like binding motifs (Data S1). FOXO TFs are evolutionarily
conserved longevity determinants: activation of FOXO orthologs
can extend lifespan in budding yeast, worms, and flies, and hu-
man Foxo3 is one of only two genes consistently associated with
longevity (Giannakou et al., 2004; Hwangbo et al., 2004; Kenyon
et al., 1993; Morris et al., 2015; Postnikoff et al., 2012).
To explore whether the sole fly FOXO ortholog, dfoxo, may be
involved in the transcriptional response to 83S, we compared
the list of sugar-responsive genes to the previously published
set of genes differentially expressed in dfoxoD females (Alic
et al., 2011). We found that the expression of 60% of sugar-
responsive genes was also altered in dfoxoD flies, representing
a highly significant overlap (p = 9.4 3 10�181; Figure 2). The tran-
scriptional changes tended to be in the same direction between
the two treatments (Figure 2), suggesting that dFOXO is inhibited
by high sugar. We used Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis
on the genes regulated by both 83S and dfoxo to predict the
functional consequences of this inhibition. We found an enrich-
ment of genes encoding chromatin modifiers, such as a range
of chromatin/nucleosome remodelers and histone-modifying
enzymes (Data S1), implicating epigenetic mechanisms in the
long-term effects of sugar downstream of dfoxo. Overall, the
transcriptional response pointed toward dFOXO as a candidate
mechanistic mediator of nutritional programming by a sugar-rich
diet in Drosophila, which we pursued further.
dFOXO Is Inhibited on Sugar-Rich Diet and Required for
Transcriptional Changes that Mark Dietary History
We next examined whether dFOXO is regulated on 83S diet.
dFOXO is inhibited by the signaling cascade initiated by
Drosophila insulin-like peptides (DILPs) (Teleman, 2009). We
found that one of these, dilp6, was induced after 1 week of
feeding on the 83S diet (p < 0.05; Figure 3A). Such an increase
in insulin/insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling is expected to
result in phosphorylation and inhibition of dFOXO (Brunet et al.,
1999; Alic et al., 2011). Indeed, we found that dFOXO phosphor-
ylation was increased on the 83S diet (p < 0.05; Figure 3B). To
confirm that this phosphorylation impacts dFOXO’s transcrip-
tional activity, we selected several genes identified as respon-
sive to both the 83S diet and dfoxo deletion and examined
whether their transcript levels were modulated by 83S in a
dfoxo-dependent manner. We focused on genes encoding
epigenetic regulators due to their likely relevance to the legacy
of the 83S diet. The transcript levels of Acf, encoding a chro-
matin assembly factor subunit, D12, a subunit of the ATAC
histone acetyltransferase complex, egg, a histone methyltrans-
ferase, HDAC1, a histone deacetylase, and Hmt4-20, a histone
methyltransferase, were all reduced in dfoxoD flies (p < 0.005)
and in the wild-type females fed 83S diet (p < 0.05; Figure 3C).
Importantly, 83S did not repress these transcripts in dfoxoD flies
(p = 6 3 10�4 for genotype by diet interaction; Figure 3C), con-
firming diet-induced changes as mediated by dFOXO inhibition.
Hence, sugar-rich diet induces dilp6 and inhibits dFOXO to
repress dFOXO target genes, including epigenetic modifiers.
Figure 2. Transcriptional Response to Sugar Implicates dFOXO
The transcriptional response to 83S is plotted against the response induced
by deletion of dfoxo. Genes with significant differential expression (FDR =
10%) in either or both conditions are indicated. Note that only the genes
present in both datasets are included. See also Data S1.

 The induction of dilp6, phosphorylation of dFOXO, and repres-
sion of its targets did not persist after recovery on 13S diet
(Figures 3A, 3B, and S2A). However, the transient repression
of dFOXO may have long-term consequences through the
observed, dfoxo-dependent regulation of epigenetic modifiers.
To find evidence of long-term changes to chromatin, we exam-
ined nuclear DNA distribution in the fat body, an adipose-like or-
gan in which dFOXO activity extends lifespan (Giannakou et al.,
2004; Hwangbo et al., 2004). Nuclear DNA distribution is indica-
tive of global chromatin arrangements (Fedorova and Zink, 2009;
Tian et al., 2016). The frequency of DNA foci staining brightly with
DAPI was increased after recovery from 83S in the wild-type, but
not dfoxoD, flies, which already displayed high levels on 13S
(Figure 3D), consistent with dfoxo-dependent resetting of chro-
matin states by 83S. Such changes in chromatin states would
be expected to result in persistent transcriptional changes. To
examine whether any such changes exist, we performed RNA-
seq on flies that consumed 83S or 13S food for 1 week and
then recovered on 13S for 1 week. This experiment was per-
formed at the same time as analysis of transcriptional changes
during 83S feeding described above, allowing us to compare
expression both before and after recovery. For an unbiased
assessment of global transcriptional changes, we performed
principal-component analysis (PCA) on all samples. PCA sug-
gested an overall difference in the transcriptomes of flies that
had recovered from the 83S diet and their sisters, which were
continuously kept on 13S, indicating there is a long-term tran-
scriptional program set up by 83S feeding (Figure 3E). This pro-
gram was distinct from the response observed before recovery
both globally (Figure 3E) and at the level of differential expression

(A) dilp6 transcript levels in wild-type females kept
on 83S or 13S for 1 week (before recovery) and
then allowed to recover on 13S for 1 week (after
recovery). Data were scaled to 13S before re-
covery and analyzed with a linear model: the
interaction between diet and time was significant
(p = 0.01; n = 4). dilp6 was induced significantly
before (p < 0.05; two-tailed t test), but not after,
recovery.
(B) Phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms
of dFOXO were separated by SDS-PAGE in whole-
fly protein extracts obtained from females kept
on 83S or 13S for 3 weeks and recovered on 13S
for 1 week. Quantifications from three repeats are
shown to the right. The data were analyzed with
a mixed-effects linear model, with repeat as a
random effect: there was no significant effect
of diet or time, but their interaction was signifi-
cant (p = 0.024). 83S was significantly different
from 13S before (t test; p < 0.05), but not after,
recovery.
(C) Transcript levels of five genes encoding chro-
matin modifiers in wild-type and dfoxoD females
after 1 week feeding on 13S or 83S. Data were
scaled to wild-type levels on 13S and analyzed
with a linear model: the effects of transcript, diet,
and genotype were significant (p < 0.005; n = 4).
Interactions between transcript and other co-
variates were not significant, and genotype inter-
acted with diet (p = 6 3 10�4): diet had a significant
effect in the wild-type (p < 0.05; t test), but not
dfoxoD.

Generalized linear model with a Poisson distribution revealed a significant effect of genotype and significant interaction of genotype with diet (n = 50–90 nuclei
from four or five animals; p < 10�4).
(E) PCA analysis of transcriptomes of flies exposed to 83S or 13S for 1 week (before recovery; see Figure 2) or those allowed to recover for 1 week on 13S (after

(F) Gnmt transcript levels in wild-type or dfoxoD females kept on 83S or 13S for 1 week and then allowed to recover on 13S for 1 week. Data are scaled to wild-
type on 13S and analyzed with a liner model: interaction between genotype and diet was significant (p = 0.03; n = 3 or 4), with Gnmt induced in the wild-type after
83S feeding (p < 0.05; t test), but not in dfoxoD.

 of individual genes (Figure S2B; Data S1), indicating it is not sim-
ply a carryover of the changes occurring before recovery. Hence,
feeding with 83S appears to place a novel, historic signature
upon the fly’s transcriptome.
Genes differentially expressed after recovery were not en-
riched for forkhead-like motifs in their promoters or for genes
differentially expressed in dfoxo nulls, consistent with cessation
of dFOXO repression after recovery. To address whether dfoxo is
required for the transcriptional legacy of the 83S diet, we
profiled the mRNA levels of the gene encoding glycine N-meth-
yltransferase (Gnmt), chosen because it was the most highly
induced gene in response to 83S after recovery (Figure S2B).
We confirmed that Gnmt mRNA levels were significantly induced
by prior exposure to 83S diet after 1 week of recovery in wild-
type flies (p < 0.05; Figure 3F). Gnmt could simply be responding
to the long-term changes in the levels of its substrate, S-adeno-
syl-methionine (SAM). However, we found that, even though
SAM levels increased on 83S diet, the increase did not persist
and could not account for increased Gnmt levels after recovery
(Figure S2C). Hence, Gnmt induction is a transcriptional marker
of the history of high-sugar feeding independent of current SAM
levels. Importantly, Gnmt induction was not observed in dfoxoD
females (p = 0.03 for genotype by sugar interaction; Figure 3F),
revealing that dfoxo is required for this transcriptional memory

of past sugar consumption. Overall, our
data imply that a high-sugar diet revers-
ibly
inhibits
dFOXO
to
cause
short-
and long-term transcriptional changes,
perhaps accounting for the programming
of lifespan observed.
dfoxo/daf-16 Are Required for
Programming of Lifespan by Early-
Life Sugar-Rich Diet
Our data suggested that altered dFOXO
activity in early life can influence subse-
quent survival. Indeed, 3-week induction
of dfoxo in the gut and fat body of adult
females using the tissue-specific, induc-
ible, S1106 driver was sufficient to extend their subsequent
lifespan (p < 0.05; Figure 4A; Giannakou et al., 2007). Impor-
tantly, dFOXO levels have been shown to revert back to normal
after induction ceases (Giannakou et al., 2007). Whereas the life-
span effect of transient induction was less than achieved by
chronic induction (Figure 4A), it confirmed that dFOXO activity
in early life can have long-term consequences.
Is dfoxo required for the long-term, detrimental effect of a
sugar-rich diet? We tested this in three independent experi-
ments. dfoxoD females are short lived, both on 13S and 83S
(Al Saud et al., 2015). To avoid bias that could result from a
strong selection on the dfoxoD population, we limited the expo-
sure to 83S in early adulthood to only 1 week in the first exper-
iment (Figure 4B). In the second, we limited the dose of sugar to
43S for 3 weeks (Figure 4C). Finally, we tested whether 2 weeks
on 83S, which resulted in nearly 50% of the dfoxoD population
dying during treatment, could elicit a response in the surviving
dfoxoD flies (Figure 4D). We assessed survival after treatment
to isolate the effects of dietary history. Transient feeding with
sugar-rich diets and the deletion of dfoxo both had a significant,
detrimental effect on subsequent survival (p < 2 3 10�16 in all
experiments; Tables S2–S4). Importantly, historical exposure
to sugar-rich diets did not further shorten the lifespan of dfoxoD
females in any experiment (p < 0.05 for interaction between

 diet and genotype; Figures 4B–4D; Tables S2–S4), revealing that
dfoxo is required for the effects of dietary history on survival. This
implies that a high-sugar diet in early adulthood acts through
dfoxo to program lifespan.
We sought to establish whether the role of dFOXO in nutritional
programming of lifespan was conserved in its worm ortholog,
DAF-16. Chronic exposure to glucose reduces worm lifespan
by inhibiting DAF-16 (Lee et al., 2009; Schulz et al., 2007), but
the effects of transient exposure have not been examined. Pres-
ence of additional glucose in the media throughout development
or during the first 6 days of adulthood (a third of median life ex-
pectancy) reduced the subsequent survival in wild-type worms
(p < 2 3 10�16; Figure 4E; Table S5), revealing a lasting detri-
mental effect equivalent to that in the fly. Importantly, the survival
of the daf-16 worms was not sensitive to glucose in early life (Fig-
ure 4E; p < 2 3 10�16 for interaction between diet and genotype;
Table S5). Hence, the role of FOXO factors in mediating
nutritional programming of lifespan is evolutionarily conserved
between flies and worms, making it likely that they play an equiv-
alent role in nutritional programming in mammals.
DISCUSSION
Epidemiological and other data have provided extensive evi-
dence that nutrition in early life can have lasting consequences
for aging and age-related disease in mammals, including hu-
mans (Alfaradhi and Ozanne, 2011; Barnes and Ozanne, 2011).
However, to date, it has been unclear whether any of the several
evolutionarily conserved, longevity-assurance mechanisms that
have been discovered in simpler animal models (Gems and Par-
tridge, 2013) connect early nutrition to health and survival in later
life. Our study strongly implicates FOXO factors as this missing
mechanistic link between early-life nutrition and longevity. The
strong evolutionary conservation of FOXO function makes it
highly likely that FOXO factors play a role in some aspect of nutri-
tional programming in mammals.
The role of dFOXO in mediating the long-term effects of a
sugar-rich diet in Drosophila is surprisingly specific. dFOXO is
not required for the lifespan benefits of a chronic reduction
in protein intake, even though its activity can modulate the
response (Giannakou et al., 2008). Similarly, the survival of
dfoxo-null flies is reduced by chronic feeding with a sugar-rich
diet to the same extent as the wild-type’s (Al Saud et al.,
2015). These differences in the role of dFOXO in response to
chronic or acute dietary regimes, or different dietary compo-
nents, may arise from the complex interactions between nutrition
and insulin/IGF-like signaling: each DILP is expressed in a unique
tissue pattern, acts in an endocrine and/or paracrine manner,
and responds distinctly to the relative amounts of protein and
carbohydrate present in the diet (Post and Tatar, 2016). This, in
turn, may specify the tissues in which dFOXO is inhibited by
specific diets and the nature of dFOXO targets affected.
In aging studies, the principal focus is on discovering and un-
derstanding mechanisms whereby lifespan can be extended and
health maintained in later life. Several instances already exist
where a transient intervention, be it during development or in
adulthood, can have prolonged beneficial consequences (Bitto
et al., 2016; Dillin et al., 2002; Schulz et al., 2007). For example,
mild impairment of mitochondrial function during worm develop-
ment can extend adult lifespan (Dillin et al., 2002), and these
long-term effects are mediated by epigenetic changes (Merk-
wirth et al., 2016; Tian et al., 2016). We have investigated how
lifespan is curtailed, rather than extended, by unhealthy nutrition
in early adulthood. Similar to transient, lifespan-extending inter-
ventions, it is likely that the long-term, detrimental effects of
diet-induced FOXO inhibition are also due to persistent epige-
netic modifications. Indeed, DAF-16 engages the SWI/SNF chro-
matin-remodeling complex to increase worm lifespan (Riedel
et al., 2013). Our gene expression data show that, in Drosophila,
a sugar-rich diet represses dFOXO to drive changes in expres-
sion of a number of epigenetic modifiers, which is likely to
have substantial consequences for the epigenome. Elucidating
these dfoxo-dependent epigenetic changes and how they could
be reversed may form the basis of future treatments to remedy
the cost of past diets.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Fly Husbandry, Food, Feeding, and Lifespan Assays
Outbred, Dahomey fly population carrying the w1118 mutation was used in all
experiments. D. melanogaster diet contained 10% yeast, 1.5% agar with
40% (83S) or 5% (13S) sucrose (all w/v). When required, RU486 (200 mM)
was included in the food. C. elegans were reared as per Brenner (1974) and
worms exposed to 2% glucose in NGM plates from embryo or from L4 stage.
RNA was isolated with Trizol for qPCR and RNA sequencing. Protein samples
were extracted in TCA and dFOXO phosphorylation assessed as described
(Alic et al., 2011; Giannakou et al., 2007). Transcriptomes were analyzed by
aligning reads to Drosophila genome dm6 in Tophat2, enumerating reads
with HTSeq, and model fitting using DESeq2. TF-binding motif enrichment
was analyzed using iRegulon. Survival was analyzed in R and JMP. See
Supplemental Experimental Procedures for full details of animal husbandry,
molecular, and data analysis.
