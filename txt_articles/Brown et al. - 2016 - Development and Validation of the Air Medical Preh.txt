Abstract
 Objective—Develop and internally validate a triage score that can identify trauma patients at 
the scene who would potentially benefit from helicopter emergency medical services (HEMS).
 Summary Background Data—Although survival benefits have been shown at the 
population level, identification of patients most likely to benefit from HEMS transport is 
imperative to justify the risks and cost of this intervention.
 Methods—Retrospective cohort study of subjects undergoing scene HEMS or ground 
emergency medical services (GEMS) in the National Trauma Databank (2007–2012). Data were 
split into training and validation sets. Subjects were grouped by triage criteria in the training set 
and regression used to determine which criteria had a survival benefit associated with HEMS. 
Points were assigned to these criteria to develop the Air Medical Prehospital Triage (AMPT) 
score. The score was applied in the validation set to determine if subjects triaged to HEMS had a 
survival benefit when actually transported by helicopter.
 Results—There were 2,086,137 subjects included. Criteria identified for inclusion in the 
AMPT score included GCS<14, respiratory rate<10 or >29, flail chest, hemo/pneumothorax, 
paralysis, and multisystem trauma. The optimal cut-off for triage to HEMS was ≥2 points. In 
subjects triaged to HEMS, actual transport by HEMS was associated with an increased odds of 
survival (AOR 1.28; 95%CI 1.21–1.36, p<0.01). In subjects triaged to GEMS, actual transport 
mode was not associated with survival (AOR 1.04; 95%CI 0.97–1.11, p=0.20).

  Conclusions—The AMPT score identifies patients with improved survival following HEMS 
transport and should be considered in air medical triage protocols.
 INTRODUCTION
Rapid transport of the patient with severe injury to the highest level of care is a cornerstone 
of modern trauma care. Delay of trauma care is a well-documented cause of mortality.1 
Helicopter emergency medical services (HEMS) have become an important component of 
trauma care and systems. Although survival benefits have been shown at the population 
level, selection of patients most likely to benefit from HEMS transport is imperative to 
justify the risks and cost of this resource intensive intervention.2–6
Prospectively identifying patients that would benefit from HEMS at the scene of injury 
remains a significant challenge. Many prior investigations evaluating HEMS outcomes 
exclude patients from study using severity indices not available in the field. Thus, a segment 
of patients who undergo HEMS transport are systematically excluded and this offers little 
guidance in selecting appropriate patients for HEMS transport after trauma. Overall, there is 
inadequate evidence to guide development of standardized HEMS triage criteria, leading to a 
lack in national HEMS triage guidelines and wide variation among regional criteria and 
compliance.7, 8
The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) developed the most recent version of the national 
field triage guidelines (NFTG) to identify patients who should be transported to a trauma 
center.9 It is not clear, however, that the same criteria used for trauma triage are equally 
effective in identifying patients that should be flown to a trauma center. Adopting this 
approach leads to high overtriage and costs, limiting the benefits. Our group previously has 
demonstrated only a subset of NFTG criteria may be useful for HEMS triage based on 
improved outcomes; however these were not further validated.10
The American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma (ACS-COT) also recently 
authored guidelines that have made research to optimize the use of HEMS a national 
priority.11 These guidelines cite a lack evidence to guide development of standardized 
HEMS triage criteria, highlighting the need for work to help policy makers develop specific 
guidelines for triage criteria and appropriate use of HEMS in trauma.
The objective of this study was to develop and internally validate a simple triage score that 
can prospectively identify trauma patients at the scene of injury who would potentially 
benefit from HEMS transport compared to ground emergency medical services (GEMS) 
transport. The study hypothesis was that a subset of existing trauma triage criteria would 
predict improved survival associated with HEMS transport and therefore would be useful to 
incorporate into an air medical triage score for injured patients.
 METHODS
 Study Population
Subjects aged ≥ 16 years undergoing either HEMS or GEMS transport from the scene of 
injury in the National Trauma Databank (NTDB) between 2007 and 2012 were eligible for

 inclusion. The NTDB represents a national database containing over 3 million injured 
patients from more than 900 hospitals in the US.12 Subjects transferred from another 
hospital or with isolated burn injury were excluded. Demographics, hospital characteristics, 
injury severity, vital signs, International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) 
diagnosis codes, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation, emergency 
department (ED) disposition, and hospital disposition were collected for each subject. The 
study sample was divided by year of admission into a training set (2007–2009) and a 
validation set (2010–2012).
 Missing Data
To address missing data, multiple imputation was performed for analysis variables missing 
between 5% and 30% of observations. Imputed variables included prehospital systolic blood 
pressure (SBP), prehospital respiratory rate (RRR, prehospital Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), 
prehospital heart rate (HR), and insurance status. Multiple imputation using chained 
equations with a fully conditional specification model based on available demographics, 
vital signs, and injury characteristics was performed using five imputation steps to develop 
five imputed datasets. Outcome models were performed using multiple imputation 
estimation techniques that combine model coefficients and standard errors from each 
imputed dataset while adjusting for the variability between imputed datasets.13 Missing data 
for imputed variables ranged from 12% (insurance status) to 27% (prehospital RR). 
Imputation procedures were performed separately for the training and validation sets. 
Sensitivity analyses with complete cases not missing any of the five imputed variables were 
performed to assess the multiple imputation procedures.
 Development of the Air Medical Prehospital Triage (AMPT) score
Available triage criteria from the NFTG and National Association of Emergency Medical 
Service Physicians air medical dispatch criteria were evaluated for inclusion in the Air 
Medical Prehospital Triage (AMPT) score.9, 14 Criteria included physiologic parameters 
(SBP<90mmHg, GCS<14, RR<10 or >29bpm), anatomic injuries (penetrating injury, 
unstable chest wall, open skull fracture, ≥ 2 proximal long bone fractures, pelvic fracture, 
crush injury, amputation, paralysis, hemo/pneumothorax, acute cardiac injury, multisystem 
trauma [>2 body regions injured]), and special considerations (age>55). Combinations of 
criteria were also considered. Criteria not feasible for field use or that resulted in 
impractically large proportions of subjects triaged to HEMS transport were omitted from the 
final AMPT score. Final criteria for potential inclusion in the AMPT score were also 
presented to prehospital providers for input on feasibility and ease of use for providers in the 
field.
To be included in the AMPT score, criteria were assessed for improved survival associated 
with HEMS transport compared to GEMS transport when present. To determine this, 
subjects were stratified by the presence or absence of each of the individual triage criteria 
described above. Subjects were then separately analyzed in these strata of individual triage 
criterion groups. A hierarchical mixed-effects logistic regression model was constructed to 
determine the independent association of HEMS compared to GEMS transport with in-
hospital survival within each individual triage criterion group. Each model included a

 random effect for centers to account for clustering at the center level and allowed for the 
possibility that the effect of transport mode on survival may differ between centers. 
Covariates in the models included gender, race, prehospital heart rate (HR), injury severity 
score (ISS), Trauma Mortality Prediction Model (TMPM) predicted mortality,15 and trauma 
center level in addition to controlling for the presence of the remaining triage criteria not 
defining the individual triage criterion group under analysis. To account for multiple model 
comparisons for each individual triage criterion group, false discovery rate correction was 
used. False discovery rate correction is a powerful method to ensure the probability of a type 
I error remains at the pre-specified level across all hypotheses tested and reports q-values 
which are false discovery rate adjusted p values.16 These q-values can be interpreted 
similarly to standard p values, and for this study a q-value ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically 
significant.
Triage criteria identified from the procedures above in the training set with improved 
survival for subjects undergoing HEMS transport were included in the AMPT score. Each 
criterion was assigned a point total based of the relative effect estimate from the adjusted 
odds ratios (AOR). Each criterion’s AOR was divided by the smallest AOR of the included 
AMPT criteria to obtain a standardized AOR. This standardized AOR was then rounded to 
the nearest integer to obtain the point assignment for the AMPT score. Combinations of 
criteria that potentially contained other AMPT criteria were assigned double points.
 Internal validation of the AMPT score
To evaluate the potential utility of AMPT criteria and whether a simple score could be used 
to predict patients most likely to benefit from HEMS transport, internal validation was 
performed using the validation set. As predictions made by regression models from the 
dataset in which they were applied are biased and overly optimistic, internal validation with 
a separate sample allows evaluation of model performance in patients other than those used 
for model development within the same underlying population.17 Further, overfitting of 
regression models may occur, particularly in large samples such as the NTDB, and lead to a 
poor prognostic model in other populations. Internal validation was used to ensure adequate 
performance of the AMPT score prior to undertaking a more complex and costly external 
validation of the score. Point totals for the AMPT score were calculated for each subject in 
the validation set. All subjects were then triaged to either HEMS or GEMS transport based 
on AMPT score total points. Various AMPT score point cutoffs were assessed for triage of a 
subject to HEMS transport, beginning with a cutoff of ≥ 1 points for triage to HEMS.
Within each AMPT score triage assignment group (HEMS or GEMS), there were some 
subjects that actually underwent HEMS transport and some that actually underwent GEMS 
transport. Validation of the AMPT score was considered successful if both of the following 
two criteria were met: (1) in the group of subjects triaged to HEMS transport by the AMPT 
score, actual HEMS transport was independently associated with increased odds of survival, 
and (2) in the group of subjects triaged to GEMS transport by the AMPT score, actual 
transport mode was not associated with survival (Fig 1).
To evaluate this, similar hierarchical mixed-effect regression models described above were 
used to determine the association of actual transport mode with in-hospital survival,

 controlling for age, gender, race, insurance status, prehospital SBP, prehospital HR, 
prehospital RR, prehospital GCS, ISS, prehospital time, TMPM predicted mortality, and 
trauma center level across both AMPT score triage assignment groups (HEMS or GEMS). 
The optimal AMPT point cutoff for determining triage to HEMS transport was considered 
the lowest single AMPT score point total that resulted in significantly increased odds of 
survival associated with actual HEMS transport for those triaged to HEMS transport, while 
actual transport mode remained unassociated with survival for those triaged to GEMS 
transport.
 Subgroup Analysis
There is population of trauma patients injured so close to a trauma center that it would be 
impractical to transport these patients by HEMS. This group of patients would not have the 
potential to undergo HEMS transport and it may be less useful to evaluate a triage scoring 
system for HEMS in these patients. Thus, to capture subjects with the potential to undergo 
HEMS transport, a subgroup analysis was performed on subjects with a transport time >15 
minutes. This transport time cut off was selected as it represents the 25th percentile of 
HEMS transport time in the validation set. To evaluate the AMPT score in these subjects, the 
same hierarchical mixed-effects models used in the primary internal validation analysis 
above were performed.
 Statistical Analysis
For univariate comparisons of baseline subject-level characteristics, Chi-square tests were 
used to compare categorical variables and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used to compare 
continuous variables. A p value ≤ 0.05 was considered significant with 2-sided tests. This 
study was determined exempt by the Institutional Review Board at the University of 
Pittsburgh. Data analysis was conducted using STATA version 13 (College Station, TX).
 RESULTS
Overall, there were 2,086,137 subjects were included in the study sample, with 12% 
undergoing HEMS transport (Fig 2). In the training set, HEMS subjects were younger, less 
likely to have penetrating injury, had higher ISS, and lower unadjusted survival (Table 1). 
When evaluating complete cases only in the training (N=457,560) and validation 
(N=792,862) datasets, no differences were seen in criteria included or performance of the 
AMPT score compared with the imputed datasets. Thus, imputed results are presented 
below.
Triage criteria evaluated for inclusion in the AMPT score are listed in Table 2 with the AOR 
of survival for HEMS compared to GEMS. Of these, eight criteria were identified for which 
subjects had increased odds of survival if transported by HEMS compared to GEMS (Table 
3). The final AMPT score is shown in Table 4 and includes seven of these criteria with 
operationalized definitions for field use.
Age >55 was excluded as it alone resulted in a 54% increase in triage to HEMS, with a 38% 
greater number of subjects triaged to HEMS than actually underwent HEMS in the 
validation set. Further analysis of age by decade revealed the survival benefit for HEMS

 transport was concentrated in older patients with age 56–75 years (AOR 1.10; 95%CI 1.01–
1.21, p=0.04), while odds of survival are lower among patients >75 years of age transported 
by HEMS (AOR 0.86; 95%CI 0.76–0.98, p=0.02). Including a criterion of age 56–75 again 
alone results in a 25% increase in triage to HEMS. Further, analysis of age<55 as a triage 
criterion also reveals HEMS is associated with an increase in odds of survival (AOR 1.11; 
95%CI 1.04–1.19, p<0.01) in this younger age group. Thus, no specific age criterion appears 
appropriate for inclusion in the AMPT score.
In the validation set, HEMS subjects were again younger, had more blunt injury, higher ISS, 
and lower unadjusted survival (Table 5). The optimal cutoff for triage to HEMS transport in 
the validation set was ≥ 2 points. When using a cutoff of ≥ 2 points for triage to HEMS 
transport, 9.9% of subjects in the validation set were triaged to HEMS transport by the 
AMPT score. Of subjects triaged to HEMS transport by the AMPT score, 23.8% actually 
underwent HEMS transport, while 9.6% of subjects triaged to GEMS by the AMPT score 
actually underwent HEMS transport.
In subjects triaged to GEMS by the AMPT score (0 or 1 point), actual transport mode was 
not associated with survival (AOR 1.04; 95%CI 0.97–1.11, p=0.20). In subjects triaged to 
HEMS by the AMPT score (≥ 2 points), actual transport by HEMS was independently 
associated with an increased odds of survival (AOR 1.28; 95%CI 1.21–1.36, p<0.01). When 
evaluating subjects with only 2 points, HEMS transport remained associated with improved 
survival (AOR 1.34, 95%CI 1.22–1.47, p<0.01).
Evaluation of alternate cutoffs (≥ 1 point, ≥3 points) for triage to HEMS transport 
demonstrated these cutoffs did not meet criteria for successful validation and confirmed a 
cutoff of ≥ 2 points as the optimal cutoff. When evaluating a cutoff of ≥ 1 point, subjects 
triaged to HEMS transport by the AMPT score with only 1 point had no association between 
actual transport mode and survival (AOR 1.04; 95%CI 0.97–1.12, p=0.26). When evaluating 
a cutoff of ≥ 3 points, subjects triaged to GEMS transport by the AMPT score had an 
increase in the odds of survival when actually transported by HEMS (AOR 1.15; 95%CI 
1.08–1.22, p<0.01).
In subgroup analysis of subjects with a transport time >15 minutes, using a cutoff of ≥ 2 
points to triage subjects to HEMS transport resulted in 8.9% of subjects in the validation set 
triaged to HEMS transport by the AMPT score. Of subjects triaged to HEMS transport by 
the AMPT score, 30.0% actually underwent HEMS transport, while 11.3% of subjects 
triaged to GEMS by the AMPT score actually underwent HEMS transport.
Within the subgroup, subjects triaged to GEMS transport by the AMPT score had no 
association between transport mode and survival (AOR 1.05; 95%CI 0.98–1.13, p=0.14), 
while subjects triaged to HEMS by the AMPT score had an increased odds of survival if 
actual transport was by HEMS (AOR 1.30; 95%CI 1.22–1.40, p<0.01). In subjects from the 
subgroup analysis triaged to HEMS with only 2 points, actual HEMS transport was also 
associated with an increased odds of survival (AOR 1.30; 95%CI 1.17–1.45, p<0.01). 
Alternate cuts of ≥ 1 point and ≥ 3 points again did not meet criteria for successful 
validation, confirming an optimal cutoff of ≥ 2 points in the subgroup analysis.

  DISCUSSION
The current results demonstrate successful development and internal validation of the AMPT 
score with the ability to discriminate which patients have a survival benefit if transported by 
HEMS in a large national dataset. Eight triage criteria were found to identify patients with 
improved survival when undergoing HEMS compared to GEMS transport. Out of these eight 
criteria, one was not included in the final AMPT score. Age >55 years was omitted as its 
inclusion resulted in an over 50% increase in triage to HEMS transport, with more patients 
being triaged to HEMS than were actually transported by HEMS in the study population. 
This is not feasible from a resource allocation standpoint and defeats the purpose of 
developing a triage tool to selectively identify patients most likely to benefit from HEMS 
transport. Further analyses of age groups reveal survival benefits for HEMS transport in 
patients ≤ 75 years, while survival appears lower in those older than 75 years, similar to 
findings from other groups.18 Thus, rather than including a specific age criterion, it may be 
more appropriate to consider applying the AMPT score only in patients ≤ 75 years, while 
those >75 years undergo ground transport. However, these age analyses are exploratory and 
require further directed study to establish what, if any, age range restriction may be 
appropriate for HEMS transport after trauma.
The seven criteria included in the AMPT score are feasible for field use by prehospital 
personnel. A primary goal for the AMPT score was to develop a tool that is simple and can 
be rapidly deployed by minimally trained first responders. These criteria are identifiable in 
the field given the limited resources in the prehospital environment, and prehospital 
personnel are familiar with them as they represent a subset existing trauma triage criteria. 
Patients with an AMPT score of ≥ 2 had improved survival if transported by HEMS, 
whereas in those with a score of 0 or 1 transport mode did not impact survival. The survival 
benefit of HEMS transport in those triaged to HEMS by the AMPT score persisted even 
when evaluating only subjects with only 2 points in the AMPT score. The AMPT score also 
performed similarly well when restricting the analysis to subjects with longer transport times 
who would have the potential to undergo HEMS transport. This score may prospectively 
identify patients most likely to benefit from HEMS transport following injury.
Recent evidence has demonstrated significant survival benefits for patients with trauma 
transported by helicopter at the population level. Our group demonstrated a significant 
survival benefit at the national level, finding HEMS patients transported from the scene of 
injury had a 22% increase in the odds of in-hospital survival compared to GEMS patients.4 
Our findings were confirmed by Sullivent et al, finding a 39% reduction in the odds of in-
hospital mortality among HEMS patients transported to a level I or II trauma center in the 
National Sample Program from the NTDB.6 Stewart et al also found a 33% reduction in the 
odds of in-hospital mortality in a state database after controlling for the likelihood of 
helicopter transport.19 More recently Galvagno and colleagues used propensity score 
matching in patients with an ISS>15, demonstrating a 16% increase in the odds of survival 
nationally among HEMS patients transported to a level I or II trauma center.5
Despite this, the risks and resources associated with HEMS transport make patient selection 
paramount. Concerns about aviation safety, cost, and over-triage have led to questions about

 the role of HEMS in trauma.2, 3, 20 Some have documented between 50% and 60% of HEMS 
transports are for patients ultimately determined to have minor injuries and may be 
unnecessary at a cost of $4,000–$5,000 per transport.3, 21, 22 Operating costs for HEMS 
programs may be as high as $1,500 per hour. Further, although both ground and helicopter 
providers are at increased risk of injury from crashes, HEMS accidents have a substantially 
higher risk of death with a rate of 0.86 fatalities per accident.2, 23
Several studies have failed to demonstrate survival benefits associated with HEMS transport 
of trauma patients.24–28 While these studies have a number of limitations, they highlight the 
need for HEMS triage and appropriate patient selection. Undoubtedly in the studies 
reporting a survival benefit for HEMS transport, not every patient is benefiting from this 
intervention, particularly when looking at large national cohorts. The survival benefit of 
HEMS transport is likely driven by some combination of speed, advanced crew capabilities 
and experience, and trauma center access.29 However, prospectively identifying patients that 
would benefit from these elements of HEMS transport using criteria available at the scene of 
injury is difficult. As a consequence, there is wide variation among regional criteria, 
compliance with local guidelines, and significant use of providers’ discretion in utilizing 
HEMS transport.7, 8, 30
Trauma triage and air medical triage address fundamentally different questions. The former 
seeks to determine what level of care the injured patient requires and helps to identify those 
that would benefit from transport to a trauma center. The latter seeks to identify those 
patients requiring a trauma center that would benefit from HEMS transport. Many patients 
may benefit from trauma center care without requiring the resources of HEMS. In other 
words, needing to go to a trauma center is not the same as needing to fly to a trauma center. 
It is imperative to recognize this distinction to optimize the use of HEMS. Adopting existing 
triage guidelines for air medical triage without modification, as many trauma systems have, 
leads to high over-triage and costs, limiting the benefits conferred by HEMS. Studies that 
demonstrate significant benefits for HEMS transport in trauma also report high rates of over-
triage. A recent analysis reported HEMS needs to save between 1–3 lives per 100 transports 
with current utilization patterns to be a cost effective intervention.21
Thus, identifying patients most likely to benefit becomes paramount. Despite this, few 
studies have evaluated air medical triage in trauma. A review article in 2009 found only five 
studies of low to moderate quality specifically addressing this issue and was unable to draw 
any substantial conclusions, noting only an altered level of consciousness may be valuable in 
identifying trauma patients for HEMS transport.7 Our group previously evaluated the NFTG 
using a similar method as the current study, finding 5 criteria that, when present, were 
associated with a survival benefit for HEMS transport.10 Patients were similarly sub-
grouped according to the presence of physiologic and anatomic NFTG criteria and survival 
was determined within each triage criterion group for HEMS compared to GEMS transport. 
Criteria that had a survival benefit associated with HEMS transport in that study included 
age >55 years, GCS<14, RR<10 or >29 breaths per minute, penetrating injury, and the 
presence of any one of the NFTG physiologic triage criteria plus any one of the NFTG 
anatomic triage criteria. All criteria but penetrating injury from our prior study were

 identified in the current data. This study represents a more robust extension of our prior 
work in an attempt to validate evidence based criteria for air medical triage in trauma.
Recently, multiple stakeholder agencies attempted to develop an evidence based guideline 
for air medical transport of trauma patients using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, 
Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology.31 This effort was hampered by very 
low quality evidence, but made the recommendation that trauma patients meeting any 
physiologic or anatomic triage criteria from the NFTG should be considered for HEMS 
transport. However, our group’s prior work and the current study demonstrate only a subset 
of the physiologic and anatomic NFTG criteria have improved survival associated with 
HEMS transport. While the NFTG criteria continue to be important in determining patient 
destination, a more selective application of evidence-based criteria for determining patient 
transport method based on improved outcomes appears warranted to reduce unnecessary 
cost and risk. Thus, efforts such as the current analysis are essential to help identify the 
optimal population of trauma patients most likely to benefit from HEMS transport and 
inform future guidelines and policy.
This work does have several limitations. First are those of a retrospective design. Second are 
those outlined by American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma for use of the 
NTDB.12 Although the NTDB data quality has improved substantially, high levels of 
missing data persist, particularly in prehospital variables. Multiple imputation was used to 
mitigate this and has been validated in this database previously.32, 33 No significant 
differences were seen for outcomes in sensitivity analysis using complete cases only, 
engendering confidence in the imputed results presented here to maintain statistical power. 
The NTDB is not a population-based dataset and skewed towards large trauma centers.34 
There were limited variables for analysis which precluded us from evaluating mechanism of 
injury criteria as potential triage criteria for inclusion in the score; however previous studies 
suggest these criteria perform poorly overall for identifying severely injured patients that 
may benefit from HEMS transport.35, 36 Anatomic criteria were derived from ICD-9 codes 
and it is unclear how reliable evaluation of these criteria are in the field based on the current 
data. We have operationalized these criteria for the final AMPT score here; however 
prospective study is necessary to ensure these criteria are identified in the field reliably and 
continue to be useful for HEMS triage. There is inevitable selection bias for allocating 
patients to HEMS or GEMS transport, and it is impossible to fully evaluate all of the factors 
that resulted in individual transport decisions in a dataset such as this. We did, however, take 
advantage of this situation to evaluate survival benefits based on actual transport mode 
compared to the AMPT allocated transport mode. Internal validation was used to evaluate 
the potential performance of the AMPT score outside the training set from which it was 
derived; however the same biases and limitations of the training set are present in the 
validation set. Despite this, we believe internal validation is a necessary first step. First, it 
demonstrated the AMPT score is potentially useful to predict patients who are most likely to 
benefit from HEMS in the same underlying population. Although the noted limitations of 
the dataset exist, the underlying population is a national sample of trauma patients and lends 
itself to generalizability. Further, since this represents the first attempt to develop a triage 
tool for HEMS transport in trauma, there is little to compare performance against and can 
serve as a benchmark for further validation. Thus, the internal validation here is necessary to

 establish preliminary data and justify the expense and efforts to move forward with a 
prospective evaluation of the AMPT score to evaluate external validity in different settings 
and populations.
Other important outcomes such as health related quality of life are not available, but remain 
important outcomes to evaluate in severely injured trauma patients. Further, we cannot 
explore the underlying mechanisms that may drive the outcome benefits seen here. Finally, it 
is important to distinguish that the AMPT score is for use in HEMS transport decisions and 
not necessarily helicopter dispatch or launch decisions.
Importantly, this score does not take into account logistical factors such as time, distance, 
and availability of transport resources, which also play a crucial role in the decision to use 
HEMS.7, 14, 37 These factors may not be amenable to evaluation using traditional outcomes 
measures such as improved survival. We did, however, find similar performance of the 
AMPT score in our subgroup of patients with longer transport times. Additionally, both the 
capabilities of GEMS providers and availability of these resources influence the role of 
HEMS in individual trauma systems. HEMS crews frequently provide a higher level of care 
than GEMS crews. HEMS providers may be trained and authorized to perform potentially 
lifesaving interventions such as rapid sequence intubation, surgical cricothyroidotomy, or 
blood product administration that GEMS providers cannot. Moreover, greater exposure to 
severely injured patients among HEMS providers may confer a volume-outcome benefit. All 
of these factors must be considered in HEMS triage guidelines. Thus the AMPT score does 
not provide a comprehensive approach to HEMS triage. It does, however, provide the first 
evidence based set of patient-level criteria that can be utilized as a starting point for 
developing tailored air medical triage guidelines within individual trauma systems.
 CONCLUSION
This study represents a novel approach with the largest and most robust evaluation of air 
medical triage criteria for trauma. The AMPT score is feasible for field use and can identify 
patients with improved outcomes following HEMS transport, targeting patients most likely 
to benefit from this resource following injury. The AMPT score directly addresses the need 
for developing standardized HEMS triage criteria raised by the ACS-COT and may help 
focus future study in this area. These findings warrant prospective validation of the AMPT 
score in further investigation. The AMPT score should be considered in conjunction with 
logistical and individual system factors when developing protocols for utilization of HEMS 
in the scene transport of injured patients.

 Figure 1. 
Validation scheme for the Air Medical Prehospital Triage (AMPT) score. For each subject in 
the validation set, the AMPT score assigned them to either helicopter emergency medical 
services (HEMS) or ground emergency medical services (GEMS) transport; however within 
each of these groups, there were some subjects that actually were transported by HEMS and 
some that were actually transported by GEMS. Successful validation of the score occurred if 
subjects assigned to HEMS transport by the AMPT score had a significant survival benefit 
when actually transported by HEMS, while in subjects assigned to GEMS transport by the 
AMPT score, actual transport mode was not associated with survival.
