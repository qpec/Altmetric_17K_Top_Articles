Abstract
Tissues with high metabolic rates often use lipid as well as glucose for energy, conferring a 
survival advantage during feast and famine.1 Current dogma suggests that high-energy consuming 
photoreceptors depend on glucose.2,3 Here we show that retina also uses fatty acids (FA) β-
oxidation for energy. Moreover, we identify a lipid sensor Ffar1 that curbs glucose uptake when 
FA are available. Very low-density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR), expressed in tissues with a high 
metabolic rate, facilitates the uptake of triglyceride-derived FA.4,5 Vldlr is present in 
photoreceptors.6 In Vldlr−/− retinas, Ffar1, sensing high circulating lipid levels despite decreased 
FA uptake5, suppresses glucose transporter Glut1. This impaired glucose entry into photoreceptors 
results in a dual lipid/glucose fuel shortage and reduction in the Krebs cycle intermediate α-
ketoglutarate (KG). Low α-KG levels promote hypoxia-induced factor-1α (Hif1a) stabilization 
and vascular endothelial growth factor (Vegfa) secretion by starved Vldlr−/− photoreceptors, 
attracting neovessels to supply fuel. These aberrant vessels invading normally avascular 
photoreceptors in Vldlr−/− retinas are reminiscent of retinal angiomatous proliferation (RAP), a 
subset of neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD)7, associated with high vitreous 
VEGF levels in humans. Dysregulated lipid and glucose photoreceptor energy metabolism may 
therefore be a driving force in neovascular AMD and other retinal diseases.
Retinal neovascularization (RAP) is seen in macular telangiectasia (MacTel)8 as well as in 
15–20% of macular neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD)7, the leading 
cause of blindness in older adults.9 Photoreceptors, densest in the macula, are amongst the 
highest energy consuming and mitochondria-rich cells2,10 consistent with high-energy 
demands causing macular neovascularization. VEGF contributes to retinal 
neovascularization, but factors that initiate VEGF secretion in macular disease remain 
largely unknown. We hypothesized that disordered photoreceptor mitochondrial energy 
metabolism might drive aberrant angiogenesis in the normally avascular photoreceptors in 
an attempt to increase fuel supply, consistent with dyslipidemia and mitochondrial 
dysfunction (associated with aging) being important risk factors of neovascular AMD.9
Retinal neurons are thought to rely on glucose for fuel.2,3 Glucose is metabolized to 
pyruvate (by glycolysis) and either converted to lactate in cytosol, or oxidized into acetyl-
CoA in mitochondria before entering the Krebs cycle to produce ATP. In photoreceptors, the 
major glucose transporter is GLUT1.11,12 Clinically, GLUT1 deficiency causes infantile 
seizures and developmental delay13, highlighting the importance of glucose metabolism in 
brain. However, GLUT1 deficient individuals have normal vision suggesting alternative 
retinal energy substrates, perhaps through lipid β-oxidation.
Lipid β-oxidation is common in heart and skeletal muscle with high metabolic rates, where 
abundant VLDLR facilitates fatty acid (FA) uptake.14 VLDLR binds chylomicrons and 
enables cleavage of long-chain FA from triglycerides (TG) by lipoprotein lipase.5 VLDLR 
fosters transcytosis of active lipoprotein lipase across endothelial cells15, to deliver free FA 
to tissue. Vldlr deletion suppresses lipid uptake and FA β-oxidation in the heart.4 We

 hypothesized a similar mechanism in Vldlr-rich, and lipid-rich photoreceptors. Lipid β-
oxidation enzymes are expressed in the eye.16 Clinically, VLDLR deletion causes 
maculopathy17 and Vldlr−/− mice develop RAP-like retinal vascular lesions (Fig. 1a).6 
Vldlr−/− mice allow exploration of the hypotheses that lipids fuel photoreceptors and fuel 
deficiency promotes neovessels.
We first linked the number of RAP-like lesions to photoreceptor energy demand. Rod 
photoreceptors consume 3–4 times more energy in darkness than in light to maintain the 
‘dark current’, an electrochemical gradient required for photon-induced depolarization.10 
Conversely, membrane turnover and visual cycle activity are decreased in darkness.10 Dark-
raised Vldlr−/− mice developed 1.5 fold more RAP-like vascular lesions than light/dark 
cycle-raised mice (Fig. 1b), suggesting that energy metabolism influences neovascular 
disease. Photoreceptors mature from the optic nerve outward towards the periphery. Energy 
consumption increases as photoreceptors mature and at P16 the more mature central retina 
had more RAP-like lesions.2,18
To determine if Vldlr loss specifically in photoreceptors was sufficient to drive pathological 
vessels, we selectively knocked down remaining Vldlr in photoreceptors (using AAV2-hRK) 
in Vldlr+/− mice with normal circulating fatty acid levels.19 RAP-like lesions developed with 
Vldlr loss in photoreceptors alone (Supplementary Fig. 1). Consistent with energy 
deficiency, Vldlr−/− photoreceptors had swollen mitochondria (3D scanning electron 
microscopy, Fig. 1c, Supplementary Videos 1,2). Moreover, Vldlr−/− retinas had lower ATP 
stores (Fig. 1d), confirming an energy deficit.
To explore the etiology of energy deficit fostering neovascularization, we examined the 
contribution of FA and glucose to WT retinal energy production (Supplementary Fig. 2a). 
The long-chain FA palmitate fueled mitochondrial β-oxidation in retinal explants, doubling 
oxygen consumption rates (OCR). Etomoxir-induced inhibition of FA transport into 
mitochondria abrogated mitochondrial respiration, confirming that FA β-oxidation 
contributes to retinal energy metabolism (Fig. 2a,b, Supplementary Fig. 2a–c). We also 
examined the contribution of glucose oxidation and found that retinal glucose could be 
oxidized by mitochondria as efficiently as FA (Supplementary Fig. 2d–f). However, as 
reported by Warburg, Cohen and Winkler3,20, the vast majority of glucose (87%) was 
converted to lactate by glycolysis rather than oxidative phosphorylation (Supplementary Fig. 
2g). Unlike WT, Vldlr−/− retinas (with limited FA uptake) did not increase mitochondrial 
respiration when exposed to palmitate (Supplementary Fig. 2h). FA therefore contributes to 
retinal energy production in addition to glucose and may be deficient in Vldlr−/− retinas.
In view of the possible role of Vldlr in retinal lipid energy metabolism, we quantified retinal 
FA uptake. Vldlr as reported was highly expressed in retinal photoreceptors (Supplementary 
Fig. 3a).21 Retinal mid/long-chain FA uptake was reduced in Vldlr−/− retinas. Serum 
turbidity reflected higher circulating lipid levels (Supplementary Fig. 3b,c). Triglycerides 
and mid/long-chain FA plasma levels (particularly palmitate) were elevated in Vldlr−/− mice 
(Fig. 2c, Supplementary Fig. 3d,e). Importantly, FA β-oxidation of lipids in mitochondria to 
produce acetyl-CoA was suppressed (Fig. 2d). In Vldlr−/− retinas, total acylcarnitine and free 
carnitine levels were reduced (Fig. 2e). Low cytosolic FA levels were associated with

 decreased peroxisome proliferative activated receptor alpha (Ppara) expression22, mainly in 
Vldlr−/− photoreceptors (Supplementary Fig. 4a,b). Ppara is a key regulator of several steps 
of FA β-oxidation22, including Cpt1a that mediates internalization of FA into mitochondria 
(Supplementary Fig. 2a). Cpt1a was enriched in WT but suppressed in Vldlr−/− 
photoreceptors (Fig. 2f). A selective Ppara agonist (WY16463) used to enhance FA β-
oxidation23, reduced RAP-like lesions in Vldlr−/− retina (Supplementary Fig. 4c). Providing 
photoreceptor (661W) cells with palmitate alone or with Ppara agonist (GW9578) further 
increased mitochondrial respiration by FA β-oxidation and not via uncoupling, since 
etomoxir abrogated the increase in respiration (Supplementary Fig. 5a–d). Extracellular 
acidification rates, reflecting lactate production from glycolysis, were not affected by a 
Ppara agonist (Supplementary Fig. 5e,f). Further exploration of the role of Ppara in 
metabolic signaling in neovascular eye disease is warranted. Collectively, our findings 
suggest that lipids are an energy substrate in retina, challenging the current dogma that 
glucose is the only fuel of photoreceptors.
We initially anticipated a compensatory upsurge in glucose uptake to mitigate FA deficiency 
in Vldlr−/− retinas. Surprisingly, retinal glucose uptake (18F-FDG) assessed by positron 
emitting tomography (PET) and retinal 18F-FDG counts was reduced compared to WT (Fig. 
2g, Supplementary Video 3), as was Glut1 expression (Fig. 2h,i), particularly in Vldlr−/− 
photoreceptors (Fig. 2h). In accord, carbohydrate metabolism was the most significantly 
regulated pathway on a gene microarray comparing Vldlr−/− to WT retinas (Supplementary 
Fig. 6a). The suppression of pyruvate kinase (Pkm2), a critical enzyme of glycolysis was 
identified by the array and confirmed by qRT-PCR (Supplementary Fig. 6b). Glut3 and 4 
were not regulated (Supplementary Fig. 6c). Hence, Vldlr−/− retinas have both lipid and 
glucose uptake deficiencies (Fig. 2) consistent with a generalized energy shortage (Fig. 1).
We posited that an abundance of lipids in Vldlr−/− serum might signal through lipid sensors 
to reduce glucose uptake and help control fuel supply to the retina (Fig. 3a). We screened for 
known FA-sensing G-protein coupled membrane receptors (GPCR) in retina. Ffar1 was the 
most abundantly expressed FA receptor in WT and increased further in Vldlr−/− retinas, 
particularly in photoreceptors (Fig. 3b,c). Ffar1, first discovered in pancreas24, governs 
glucose transport and insulin secretion in β-islet cells.25,26 High pancreatic Ffar1expression 
suppresses expression of the main endocrine pancreas glucose transporter, Glut2.27 Ffar1 has 
also been localized in brain, where its function is ill defined.28,29 In WT and Vldlr−/− retinas, 
we found that a Ffar1 agonist (GW9508) suppressed the expression of Glut112 and retinal 
glucose uptake (Fig. 3d,e, Supplementary Fig. 7a). Importantly, treatment with Ffar1 agonist 
(GW9508) more than doubled the number of RAP-like lesions in Vldlr−/− retinas compared 
to controls (Fig. 3f). Ffar1 binds lipids comprising more than 6 carbons.29 Vldlr−/− mice 
treated with Ffar1 lipid agonists medium chain triglycerides (MCT; 8–10 carbons)29 or a 
second Ffar1 selective agonist TAK-87530 had increased Glut1 suppression and more RAP-
like lesions versus controls (Supplementary Fig. 8). Deletion of Ffar1 in Vldlr−/− mice raised 
retinal glucose uptake (Fig. 3g, Supplementary Video 3) and Glut1 expression towards WT 
and Ffar1−/− levels (Fig. 3h; Supplementary Fig. 7b,c), with fewer RAP-like lesions in 
Vldlr−/−/Ffar1−/− mice (Fig. 3i). In vitro, knocking down Ffar1 or treating cells with 
MEK/ERK inhibitor (PD98059) prevented Glut1 suppression by GW9508 in photoreceptors

 (661W; Supplementary Fig. 7d–f). Therefore, Ffar1 may act as nutrient sensor, coupling 
mitochondrial metabolism with circulating substrate availability.
We hypothesized that photoreceptors challenged by a dual glucose and lipid fuel substrate 
deficiency would signal to increase vascular supply, in an attempt to restore energy 
homeostasis (Fig. 4a). Hypoxia has been assumed to be the main driver of angiogenesis, but 
inadequate nutrient availability to tissue might also control blood vessel growth. We found a 
reduction in pyruvate level, a metabolic intermediate feeding into the Krebs cycle from 
decreased glucose uptake and glycolysis (Fig. 4b) and also less acetylcarnitine from 
decreased FA uptake and β-oxidation (Fig. 4c) associated with less α-ketoglutarate (α-KG), 
an essential intermediate (Fig. 4d). Together with oxygen, α-KG is a necessary co-activator 
of propyl-hydroxylase dehydrogenase (PHD) that tags Hif1a for degradation by proline 
hydroxylation.31 Less hydroxyproline was detected in Vldlr−/− retinas, consistent with 
reduced PHD activity (Fig. 4e). Indeed, reduction in retinal glucose uptake by Ffar1 agonist 
GW9508 and glucose starvation in photoreceptors (661W) was associated with Hif1a 
stabilization (Supplementary Fig. 9a–c) and Vegfa secretion (Supplementary Fig. 9d,e). In 
vivo, Hif1a stabilization (Fig. 4f) in Vldlr−/− photoreceptors (Fig. 4g) was associated with 
Vegfa production (Fig. 4h,i). Deletion of Ffar1 in Vldlr−/− retinas suppressed Hif1a 
stabilization and Vegfa secretion (Fig. 4f,h), leading to fewer vascular lesions (Fig. 3i). 
Consistent with our results32, mice engineered to secrete Vegfa in photoreceptors develop 
retinal angiomatous proliferation comparable to Vldlr−/− mice33; Vegfa from photoreceptors 
is therefore sufficient to promote RAP-like lesions. Importantly, oxidative stress associated 
with an energy crisis may also directly stabilize Hif1a and promote Vegfa secretion in 
Vldlr−/− photoreceptors6,34,35, potentially contributing to vascular lesions. However, 
macrophages, often implicated in the etiology of AMD, were not associated with the onset 
of development of nascent RAP-like lesions, surrounding only mature vascular lesions 
(Supplementary Fig. 10). Translating these findings to human disease, higher vitreous VEGF 
levels were detected in AMD/RAP human subjects compared to controls (macular hole; Fig. 
4j). These findings imply that lipid/glucose fuel insufficiency in retina, in part through 
reduction of Krebs cycle metabolite α-KG, can drive aberrant angiogenesis in the normally 
avascular photoreceptor layer.
In the retina, the ability to use both lipids and glucose as fuel, might be beneficial in periods 
of high fuel need or fuel deprivation. Fasting liberates FA from adipose tissue that is used by 
high-energy consuming organs capable of FA β-oxidation such as heart, and perhaps retina 
(Fig. 2a–f, Supplementary Fig. 2a–c, Supplementary Fig. 5a–d). Indeed, FA β-oxidation 
disorders are associated with retinopathy.36 Tissues that use lipid as fuel curb glucose uptake 
during starvation.1,37 The capacity to sense nutrient availability and adapt fuel uptake might 
improve metabolic efficiency. G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR) are known membrane 
sensors of amino acids, glucose and lipids.38 Here we show that Ffar1 is a metabolic sensor 
of FA availability, which controls glucose entry into the retina (Fig. 3). We speculate that 
long-term suppression of glucose entry by Ffar1 in photoreceptors (perhaps secondary to 
circulating lipids) might contribute to age-related mitochondrial dysfunction in AMD or 
MacTel. Retinal effects of Ffar1 agonists considered for the treatment of type II diabetes 
should be carefully monitored, particularly in older individuals at increased risk of AMD.

 Mitochondrial metabolism may contribute to pathological angiogenesis in other diseases, 
such as cancer. To provide building blocks for proliferation, tumors promote angiogenesis at 
the cost of efficient ATP production by the Warburg effect.39 In suppressing mitochondrial 
oxidative phosphorylation, tumor cells may generate less α-KG31,40. This inhibits prolyl-
hydroxylase dehydrogenase (PHD) with ensuing HIF-1α stabilization, driving tumor 
angiogenesis required for growth. Our findings suggest the importance of mitochondrial fuel 
starvation as a driver of angiogenesis, matching energy demands with vascular supply. With 
a decline in mitochondrial function with age, this process may contribute to pathological 
angiogenesis in diseases of aging retina.
In summary, we show that lipid uptake and lipid β-oxidation are curtailed in Vldlr−/− retinas. 
Increased circulating FA can activate Ffar1, associated with decreased retinal glucose uptake 
and decreased Kreb cycle intermediate α-KG. Hif1a is stabilized and Vegfa secreted by 
Vldlr−/− photoreceptors, giving rise to pathologic RAP-like neovessels. This study 
uncovered three important novel mechanisms contributing to retinal physiology and 
neovascular AMD/RAP: (1) lipid β-oxidation is an energy source for the retina, (2) Ffar1 is 
an important nutrient sensor of circulating lipids that controls retinal glucose entry to match 
mitochondrial metabolism with available fuel substrates, and (3) nutrient scarcity is a driver 
of retinal pathological angiogenesis. These pathways may be important for discovery of new 
therapeutics.
ONLINE METHODS
Animals
All studies adhered to the NIH guide for the Care and Use of laboratory animals, the 
Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO) Statement for the Use of 
Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research and were approved by the Institutional Animal 
Care and Use Committee at Boston Children’s Hospital. Vldlr knockout mice (Vldlr−/−; 
Jackson Lab Stock: 002529) were crossed with wild type C57Bl/6 mice to obtain 
heterozygous breeders for littermate controlled experiments. Vldlr−/− mice were also crossed 
with Ffar1 knockout mice (Ffar1−/−)1 to ultimately obtain Vldlr−/−/Ffar1−/+ heterozygous 
breeders and double knockout mice (Vldlr−/−/Ffar1−/−). Pups weighing less than 5 grams or 
more than 7 grams at postnatal day (P)16 were excluded.41 Littermate Vldlr−/− pups were 
treated from P8 to P15 with WY164363 (50mg/kg once daily, intraperitoneal; Sigma), 
GW9508 (14 µM, once daily intraperitoneal; Cayman), TAK–875 (15 mg/kg twice daily, 
gavage; Selleckchem), medium chain triglyceride oil (MCT, 20µL once daily gavage; 
Nestle) or corresponding vehicle and sacrificed at P16 to quantify retinal vascular lesions. 
Mice pups of both genders were used.
Quantification of vascular lesions
For quantification of outer retina vascular lesions, reminiscent of retinal angiomatous 
proliferation (RAP) or macular telangiectasia (MacTel), mice were euthanized with a 
mixture of xylazine and ketamine and eyes were enucleated and fixed in 4% 
paraformaldehyde for 1 h at room temperature. Retinas were dissected, carefully removing 
all hyaloid vessels, and stained overnight at room temperature with fluoresceinated Isolectin

 B4 (lectin) (Alexa Fluor 594 – I21413, Molecular Probes) in 1 mM CaCl2 in PBS. Lectin-
stained retinas were whole-mounted onto Superfrost/Plus microscope slides (Fisher 
Scientific) with the photoreceptor side up and embedded in SlowFade Antifade reagent 
(Invitrogen). For quantification of retinal lesions 20 images of each whole-mounted retina 
were obtained at 10× magnification on a Zeiss AxioObserver.Z1 microscope and merged to 
form one image using AxioVision 4.6.3.0 software. Vascular lesion counts were analyzed 
using the SWIFT_MACTEL method, an adaptation of the method used to measure 
neovascularization (SWIFT_NV)42 in the oxygen induced retinopathy model.
SWIFT_MACTEL
We created a set of macros that was developed to run on ImageJ platform (National 
Institutes of Health, http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/). In brief, SWIFT_MACTEL isolates the red 
channel from a lectin-stained retinal whole mount, divides the image into four quadrants and 
removes background fluorescence to allow for the neovascularization (NV) structures to 
stand out clearly against the background fluorescence of normal vessels. Using a slide bar to 
either increase or decrease a particular quadrant’s fluorescence threshold, the 
SWIFT_MACTEL user designates a threshold that marks NV structures but not normal 
vessels to each quadrant. After setting the appropriate threshold, artifacts like cellular debris 
or hyperfluorescent retinal edges can be manually removed and excluded from 
quantification. SWIFT_MACTEL then analyzes all pixels in the image that lie above the 
chosen intensity threshold and are part of an object that has a minimum size of 100 pixels. 
By setting this cut-off in object size, small artifacts like vessel branch points are 
automatically removed. After measuring all four quadrants, SWIFT_MACTEL creates a 
composite from all four NV quadrants and calculates the total NV pixel number. Results 
from the SWIFT_NV method have been found to correlate well with results from the 
established hand measurement protocols (R2 = 0.9372) and show robust intra-individual (R2 
= 0.9376) and inter-individual (R2 = 0.9424) reproducibility42. n is number of eyes 
quantified.
Scanning electron microscopy and 3D retinal reconstruction
Tissue was processed for serial block face scanning electron microscopy (SEM) using an 
adapted version of a protocol established by Deerinck et al 20105. Whole eyes were isolated 
and fixed in Karnovsky's fixative. The cornea and lens were removed and the tissue further 
fixed in tannic acid overnight. Heavy metal infiltration was then undertaken; tissue was 
incubated in 1.5% potassium ferrocyanide, 0.5% osmium tetroxide in cacodylate buffer, 
followed by thiocarbohydrazide treatment and a second exposure to 1% osmium incubation. 
Walton’s lead aspartate exposure was not carried out, so they were finished with 1% uranyl 
acetate incubation followed by dehydration to propylene oxide and embedded in Durcupan 
ACM resin. The tissue was serially sectioned and imaged using the Gatan 3VIEW serial 
block face imaging system (Gatan, Abingdon, UK) fitted to a Zeiss Sigma variable pressure 
field emission scanning electron microscope (Zeiss, Cambridge, UK). Data was collected 
and used in Amira Software (FEI, Oregon, USA) in order to reconstruct the 3D images. 
Using the same software, photoreceptor mitochondrial volume was estimated for WT mice, 
around the lesions in Vldlr−/− mice, and away from the lesion in Vldlr−/− mice.

 ATP measurement
ATP was measured using a kit per instruction manual (Molecular Probes, A22066). Briefly, 
a standard reaction solution was made from the following components: dH2O, 20× Reaction 
Buffer, DTT (0.1 M), D-luciferin (10 mM), firefly luciferase stock solution (5 mg/mL). 
Low-concentration ATP standard solutions were prepared by diluting ATP solution (5 mM) 
in dH2O. A standard curve was generated by subtracting the background luminescence of 
the standard reaction solution from luminescence readings for a series of dilute ATP 
standard solutions. Luminescence measurements were taken for ATP-containing samples 
and the amount of ATP in experimental samples were calculated from the standard curve.
Oxygen consumption and extracellular acidification rates
All oxygen consumption rates were measured using a Seahorse XFe96 Flux Analyzer®. 
Whole retinas were isolated and 1 mm punch biopsies were loaded into the 96 well plate. 
Retinal punches were incubated in assay media (DMEM 5030 media supplemented with 12 
mM glucose, 10 mM HEPES and 26 mM NaHCO3) to measure oxygen consumption rates 
(OCR) and extracellular acidification rates (ECAR). Photoreceptor (661W) cells, were 
incubated in their assay media (DMEM 5030, 12 mM glucose, 10 mM HEPES) one hour 
prior to measurements. Fatty acid oxidation rates were determined by treating tissues or cells 
with Etomoxir (40 µM; Sigma) 40 min prior to analysis and then providing BSA (control) or 
BSA/Palmitate conjugate (Seahorse). Glucose oxidation rates were measured after injection 
of 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG, 100 mM; Sigma) or media control during data acquisition. To 
determine the maximal fatty acid or glucose oxidative capacity, the non-mitochondrial 
respiration (rate after injection of 2 µM Rotenone and 2 µM Antimycin A) was subtracted 
from the oxygen consumption rate after injection of 0.5 µM carbonyl cyanide-p-
trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP).
Glucose and lactate measurements
Whole retinas and photoreceptors (661W) were incubated in assay media (DMEM 5030, 12 
mM glucose, 10 mM HEPES) for 6 and 48 hours respectively. Media was collected, spun 
briefly (13 g) to remove cellular debris, and glucose and lactate levels measured using a 
Yellow Springs Instrument (YSI) 2950 were compared to control media that was not 
exposed to tissue or cells. To determine the conversion of glucose to lactate (the glycolytic 
rate), lactate production was divided by glucose uptake.
Retinal lipid uptake
We compared retinal long-chain fatty acid uptake of wild type and Vldlr−/− mice gavaged 
with 0.1 mg of 4,4-difluoro-5,7-dimethyl-4-bora-3a, 4a-diaza-s-indacene-3-hexadecanoic 
acid (BODIPY FL C16; Molecular Probes). Mice were euthanized 2 h later and the eyes 
were enucleated, embedded in OCT and cryo-sectioned (10 µm) for immediate imaging by 
fluorescence microscopy. Retinal FA uptake was quantitated using 14C-labeled 2-
bromopalmitate tracer injected twice daily (i.p.; 0.5 uCi per dose) from P9 to P12; total 
administered radioactivity was normalized for mouse body weight. Retinas were then 
dissected and homogenized in Ultima Gold liquid scintillation cocktail (PerkinElmer) and

 beta-counted (14C DPM) using Tri-Carb 2900TR instrument (PerkinElmer), correcting for 
background scintillation.
Plasma triglicerides (TG) and fatty acid (FA) analysis
Plasma was isolated from WT and Vldlr−/− mice by centrifugation (2000 g × 20 min; 4 °C) 
of whole blood in EDTA-coated tubes. TG were determined using the RANDOX TRIGS kit 
(TR210) per instruction manual. FAs in whole plasma were assayed as described 
previously.43 Briefly, each sample was subjected to direct trans-esterification and then 
injected into a gas chromatograph using the Agilent GC AutoSampler system (7890A). FAs 
were identified by comparison with the expected retention times of known standards and 
then analyzed with OpenLAB Software Suite (Agilent).
β-Oxidation metabolite quantification
Acylcarnitine metabolites were extracted from WT and Vldlr−/− (P12) flash frozen retinas 
using ice-cold methanol. Samples were sonicated, centrifuged and the supernatant was 
transferred to a fresh tube for nitrogen evaporation. When dry, butanolysis was performed 
(butanol-HCl, 55°C for 20 min) prior to reconstitution in mobile phase (ACN:H2O 80:20, 
formic acid 0.05%). Samples were analyzed by liquid chromatography followed by tandem 
mass spectrophotometry (LC/MS/MS, Alliance 2795 LC and Quattro micro, Waters Corp). 
Data were recorded in positive electrospray ionization and analyzed with Neolynx (Waters 
Corp).
Retinal glucose uptake
Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging studies were performed on WT, Vldlr−/−, 
Vldlr−/−/Ffar1−/− and Ffar1−/− mice (P16; Focus 120 high-resolution, Siemens), followed by 
micro CAT imaging (MicroCAT II scanner, Siemens). Fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-
FDG) was administered by intraperitoneal injection (i.p.) to obtain non-toxic radioactivity 
levels (3.7 and 37 MBq; or 0.1 to 1.0 mCi). Actual administered activity was determined 
using a dose calibrator to measure activity in the syringe before and after the injection. 
Images were acquired 60 minutes after injection to ensure radiotracer uptake. Mice were 
fasted for 6 hours prior to imaging, kept in darkness and anesthetized by inhalation of 
isoflurane (2–4%) through a nose cone for the duration of the procedure. Animals were 
imaged in a head first, prone position, and placed on a heating pad to maintain appropriate 
body temperature. Upon completion of imaging, mice were euthanized and retinas were 
dissected for precise 18F-FDG retinal activity, quantification by gamma counter, and 
corrected for decay. WT and Vldlr−/− mice pups were also injected with trace amounts 
of 3H-2-deoxyglucose (0.5 µCi daily, i.p.) and treated with GW9508 or vehicle (14 µM daily, 
i.p.) for 5 days (P7–P12). Retinas were collected and homogenized in a scintillation cocktail 
(Ecolite +, MP biomedicals) and beta-counts measured using the LS6500 Multipurpose 
Scintillation Counter (Beckman).
Laser-capture microdissection
Eyes were embedded in OCT and flash frozen immediately following enucleation. Eyes 
were cryosectioned under RNase free conditions into 10 µm sections, and collected on

 RNase-free polyethylene naphthalate glass slides (11505189, Leica). Sections were stained 
for lectin (1:50 in 1 mM CaCl2) and dehydrated with 70%, 90% and 100% ethanol washes. 
Retinal vessels and layers were microdissected with a Leica LMD 6000 system (Leica 
Microsystems) and collected directly into RNA stabilizing buffer from the RNeasy Micro kit 
(Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). RNA was extracted from microdissected tissues using the 
RNeasy Kit as described above (Qiagen), and real-time PCR was performed with the 
generated cDNA.
Reverse transcription and quantitative real-time PCR analysis
RNA samples from cell culture, whole retina or laser-captured neovessels and layers were 
treated with DNase I (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) to remove any contaminating genomic 
DNA. The DNase-treated RNA was then converted into cDNA using reverse transcriptase 
(Invitrogen). PCR primers for target genes and the control gene, cyclophilin A, were 
designed using Primer Bank and NCBI Primer Blast software. Quantitative analysis of gene 
expression was generated using an ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detection System with the 
SYBR Green Master mix kit and gene expression was calculated relative to cyclophilin A 
using the ΔcT method.
Expression Array
Illumina mouse gene microarray analysis of WT and Vldlr−/− retinas was performed in 
biological triplicate (Mouse-WG6 expression BeadChip, Illumina). The chip contains 
45,000 probe sets representing 34,000 genes. Microarray studies, from cDNA synthesis to 
raw data normalization were performed by the Molecular Genetics Core Facility at Boston 
Children’s Hospital. Briefly, total RNA (1 µg each) was reverse transcribed, followed by a 
single in vitro transcription amplification to incorporate biotin-labeled nucleotide, and 
subsequent hybridization and staining with strepatavidin-Cy3 according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions. The chip was scanned with Illumina BeadArray Reader to 
measure the signal intensity by the labeled target. Raw data were analyzed with the 
microarray software (Bead Studio Gene Expression version 3.4.0) for quality control, 
background analysis and normalization with rank invariant algorithm. Normalized data was 
further analyzed for comparative molecular and cellular pathway regulation using Ingenuity 
Pathway Analysis (p=0.05 and delta of 0.19; Quiagen).44
Immunohistochemistry
For whole mount immunohistochemistry, eyes were enucleated and fixed in 4% 
paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 1 h. The retina was isolated and stained for 
retinal vasculature and lesions with fluoresceinated Isolectin B4 (Alexa Fluor-594 in PBS 
with CaCl2 1 mM, I21413, Molecular Probes) overnight at room temperature (RT). Retinas 
were visualized using a 5× objective with a Zeiss AxioObserver.Z1 microscope, and imaged 
with a Zeiss AxioCam MRm operated by AxioVision software (version 4.6.3.0). Whole 
mounts were also fixed and permeabilized in cold methanol (20 min at –20 °C), blocked in 
3% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Triton X-100, stained with Isolectin B4 to visualize 
vessels (as above) and/or with primary antibodies against HIF1α (1:100 in TBS, NB00-134, 
Novus), VEGF (1:100, RB-222, Thermo Scientific), IBA-1 (1:200, CP290A, Biocare 
Medical UK) and blue opsin cone (1:100, sc-14365, Santa Cruz) overnight at 4 °C, followed

 by secondary antibody staining (1 h at RT; AlexaFluor 1:1000, Invitrogen). Flatmounts (and 
cross-section) were imaged with confocal microscopy (Leica TCS SP2 AOBS) and z-stacks 
were 3D reconstructed using Volocity software (Perk Elmer).
Western Blot and ELISA
Retinal samples were obtained as described above. Retinal lysate (20 µg) from three 
different animals or endothelial cells lysate (10 µg) were loaded on an SDS-PAGE gel and 
electroblotted onto a PVDF membrane. We used retinal nuclear extract (abcam, Ab113474, 
as per manufacturer’s protocol) to enrich Hif1a signals. After blocking, the membranes were 
incubated with antibodies against β-Actin (Sigma, A1978), Fibrillarin (Cell Signaling, 
2639), Hif1a (Novus, NB100-134), and Glut1 (Novus, NB300-666 and Abcam, Ab652), 
Glut3 (Millipore, AB1344) and Glut4 (Abcam, ab654) overnight (1:1000 each). After 
washing, membranes were incubated with 1:10,000 horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-
rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Amersham, NA931V and NA934V) for one hour 
at room temperature. Densitometry was analyzed using ImageJ. Retinal Vegfa concentration 
was measured by ELISA (as per manual, MMV00, R&D Systems) and normalized by doing 
a Bradford to measure the total cell protein content of each samples.
Metabolite Profiling
Metabolites of rapidly dissected WT and Vldlr−/− retinas (flash frozen less then a minute 
from euthanasia; 15–16 biological replicates) were homogenized in 80% methanol (8 µL/mg 
of tissue) containing the internal standards inosine-15N4, thymine-d4, and glycocholate-d4 
(Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) using a TissueLyser II (Qiagen) bead mill for 4 minutes at 
20 Hz. Samples were centrifuged (9,000 g, 10 min, 4 °C) to pellet debris and supernatants 
were analyzed using two liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS) 
methods to measure polar metabolites as described previously.45,46 Briefly, negative 
ionization mode multiple reaction mode (MRM) data were acquired using an ACQUITY 
UPLC (Waters) coupled to a 5500 QTRAP triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (AB 
SCIEX). The supernatants were injected directly onto a 150 × 2.0 mm Luna NH2 column 
(Phenomenex) that was eluted at a flow rate of 400 µL/min with initial conditions of 10% 
mobile phase A [20 mM ammonium acetate and 20 mM ammonium hydroxide (Sigma-
Aldrich) in water (VWR)] and 90% mobile phase B [10 mM ammonium hydroxide in 75:25 
v/v acetonitrile/methanol (VWR)] followed by a 10 min linear gradient to 100% mobile 
phase A. The ion spray voltage was –4.5 kV and the source temperature was 500°C. Positive 
ionization mode MRM data were acquired using a 4000 QTRAP triple quadrupole mass 
spectrometer (AB SCIEX) coupled to an 1100 Series pump (Agilent) and an HTS PAL 
autosampler (Leap Technologies). Cell extracts (10 µL) were diluted using 40 µL of 
74.9:24.9:0.2 (v/v/v) acetonitrile/methanol/formic acid containing stable isotope-labeled 
internal standards [0.2 ng/µL valine-d8, Isotec; and 0.2 ng/µL phenylalanine-d8 (Cambridge 
Isotope Laboratories)] and were injected onto a 150 × 2.1 mm Atlantis HILIC column 
(Waters). The column was eluted isocratically at a flow rate of 250 µL/min with 5% mobile 
phase A (10 mM ammonium formate and 0.1% formic acid in water) for 1 minute followed 
by a linear gradient to 40% mobile phase B (acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid) over 10 
minutes. The ion spray voltage was 4.5 kV and the source temperature was 450°C. Raw data 
were processed using MultiQuant 2.1 (AB SCIEX) for automated peak integration and

 metabolite peaks were manually reviewed for quality of integration and compared against 
known standards to confirm identity.
Photoreceptor (661W) cell culture
Cone photoreceptor cells47,48 (661W; from Dr. Al-Ubaidi) were cultured as monolayers at 
37 °C, 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere in DMEM with FBS 10% supplemented with 
hydrocortisone (20 µg/500 mL, H-2270, Sigma), Progesterone (20 µg/500 mL, P-8783, 
Sigma), Putrescine (0.016 g/500 mL, P-7505, Sigma) and β-mercaptoethanol (20 µL/500 
mL, M-6250, Sigma). Cells were not contaminated by mycoplasma. Equal number of 661W 
cells (0.3×106) were plated in 6-well dishes and cultured to 80% confluence. Cells were 
washed twice with PBS, starved for 4 hours (above medium without FBS) then stimulated 
with GW9508 (14 µM, Cayman) or vehicle. Photoreceptors were then collected 8 hours 
post-treatment for Hif1a protein expression (see western blot); while their medium was 
collected at 12 hours for Vegfa quantification by ELISA (as per manual, MMV00, R&D 
Systems). Vegfa concentration was normalized for the number of cells per well, by doing a 
Bradford to measure the total cell protein content of each well.
Preparation of AAV2-RK-shVldlr vector and AAV2 virus
Three independent shRNAs against mouse Vldlr were designed using a published 
algorithm49. The template oligonucleotides contain miR-30 microRNA, miR-30 loop and 
Vldlr shRNA including the sense and the antisense were synthesized (Invitrogen). DNA 
fragments were amplified, purified, digested and inserted into modified CAG-GFP-miR30 
vector (provided by Dr. Zhiqiang Lin and Dr. William T. Pu at Boston Children’s Hospital) 
according to a previous report50 and CAG promoter was replaced with rhodopsin kinase 
(RK) promoter51 that was cloned from pAAV-RK-GFP (provided by Dr. Connie Cepko and 
Dr. Tiansen Li). The Vldlr knock down efficiency was tested in pup retinas. Recombinant 
AAV2 vectors were produced as previously described52. Briefly, AAV vector, rep/cap 
packaging plasmid, and adenoviral helper plasmid were mixed with polyethylenimine and 
transfected into HEK293T cells (CRL-11268, ATCC). Seventy-two hours after transfection, 
cells were harvested and the cell pellet was resuspended in virus buffer, followed by 3 cycles 
of freeze-thaw, and homogenized. Cell debris was pelleted at 5,000 g for 20 minutes, and the 
supernatant was run on an iodixanol gradient. Recovered AAV vectors were washed 3 times 
with PBS using Amicon 100K columns (EMD Millipore). Real-time PCR was used to 
determine genome titers of the recombinant AAV. This protocol also was used to prepare a 
control AAV2-shControl. Viruses were diluted to various concentrations to test infection, 
and a concentration of approximately 2 × 1012 gc/mL was used for the experiments. The 
sequences of the mouse Vldlr siRNAs are as follows: shVldlr #1 (5’-3’), GGA AAG TTC 
AAG TGC AGA AGC G; shVldlr #2 (5’-3’), GGA ATG CCA TAT CAA CGA ATG C; 
shVldlr #3 (5’-3’), GGG ATC TGC AGT CAA ATT TGT A; Scramble shRNA control 
(5’-3’), GAT TTA AGA CAA GCG TAT AAC A.
Human samples and vitrectomy
The study conforms to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki, and approval of the human 
clinical protocol and informed consent were obtained from the Maisonneuve-Rosemont 
Hospital (HMR) ethics committee (Ref. CER: 10059). All patients previously diagnosed

 with AMD were followed and surgery was performed by a single vitreoretinal surgeon 
(F.A.R.). Vitreous samples were frozen on dry ice immediately after biopsy and stored 
(−80 °C). VEGFA ELISAs were performed according to manufacturer’s instructions 
(DVE00, R&D Systems).
Statistical analysis
We used Student’s t-test, and ANOVA with Dunnet, Bonferroni or Tukey post-hoc analysis 
(see Supplementary Table 2), to compare different groups; p<0.05 was considered 
statistically different. D’Agostino-Pearson or Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) normality test 
were used to confirm normal distribution. Data with non-Gaussian distribution was analysed 
using a Mann Whitney test (non-parametric, two groups). Animals were not randomized but 
quantifications were blinded when possible. All experiments were repeated at least 3 times. 
Values more than 2 standard deviations from the mean were considered outliers and were 
excluded. Sample size was estimated to detect a difference of 20% with a power of 80% (1-
β) and α of 0.05 in accordance with the ‘Guidelines for the Use of Animals in Neuroscience’ 
(2003). Results are presented as mean ± SEM. * P < 0.05, ** P < 0.01, *** P < 0.001.

 Figure 1. Retinal energy deficits are associated with vascular lesions in Vldlr−/−
(a) Pathologic vessels in Vldlr−/− retinas originated from the deep vascular plexus (DVP) 
and breached the outer plexiform layer (P12), extending towards photoreceptor outer 
segments (os) at P16. Scale: 200 µm. n = 5 retinas. (b) Vldlr−/− pups raised in darkness (n = 
10 retinas) compared to normal 12 hours light/dark cycle (Ctl: control, n = 28) to increase 
retinal energy demands. Scale: 1 mm (left), 0.5 mm (others). White spots label vascular 
lesions. P = 0.0031. (c) Mitochondrial volume quantified by 3D reconstruction of retinal 
scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images. Mitochondria within photoreceptors are 
pseudo-colored. n = 23 photoreceptors. Scale: 5µm. P < 0.0001. (d) Retinal ATP level was 
significantly lower in Vldlr−/− retina (n = 6) compared to littermate control wild type retinas
