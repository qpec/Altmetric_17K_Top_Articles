Concern has been raised over increased male reproductive disor-
ders in the Western world, and the disruption of male endocrinol-
ogy has been suggested to play a central role. Several studies have
shown that mild analgesics exposure during fetal life is associated
with antiandrogenic effects and congenital malformations, but the
effects on the adult man remain largely unknown. Through a
clinical trial with young men exposed to ibuprofen, we show that
the analgesic resulted in the clinical condition named “compen-
sated hypogonadism," a condition prevalent among elderly men
and associated with reproductive and physical disorders. In the
men, luteinizing hormone (LH) and ibuprofen plasma levels were
positively correlated, and the testosterone/LH ratio decreased. Us-
ing adult testis explants exposed or not exposed to ibuprofen, we
demonstrate that the endocrine capabilities from testicular Leydig
and Sertoli cells, including testosterone production, were sup-
pressed through transcriptional repression. This effect was also
observed in a human steroidogenic cell line. Our data demonstrate
that ibuprofen alters the endocrine system via selective transcrip-
tional repression in the human testes, thereby inducing compen-
sated hypogonadism.

M
uch concern has been raised over declining male re-
productive health, and the disruption of male endocrinol-
ogy has been suggested to play a central role (1, 2). Male
reproduction and general health rely on androgens, as well as on
other hormones, which are mainly produced by testicular Leydig
and Sertoli cells. In addition to the testis, the androgens act in
many somatic organs, e.g., producing anabolic effects on muscle
mass and influencing cognitive functions (3). Luteinizing hor-
mone (LH) produced by the pituitary is the primary stimulator of
testosterone production, and the testosterone/LH ratio is rou-
tinely used as a clinical marker of Leydig cell function. When
Leydig cell function is compromised, normal or nearly normal
testosterone levels can often be sustained by augmented LH
levels, as observed in the clinical entity termed “compensated
hypogonadism” (4). The essential importance of the pituitary–
gonadal axis is emphasized by the recent association of hypo-
gonadism with a wide range of risk factors and all-cause mor-
tality in men (4, 5).
The so-called “over-the-counter” mild analgesics (hereafter simply
called “analgesics”), such as acetaminophen/paracetamol, acetylsa-
licylic acid/aspirin, and ibuprofen, are among the most commonly
used pharmaceutical compounds worldwide (6, 7). Increasing evi-
dence from recent years shows that exposure to analgesics can
generate negative endocrine and reproductive effects during fetal life
(6). Nonetheless, no in-depth studies have analyzed the effect of mild
analgesics on the human pituitary–gonadal axis. In this context,
ibuprofen is especially interesting because of its increasing use in the
general population and in particular by elite athletes (8–12).
Therefore in this study we focused on how ibuprofen, used in
the general population for aches, pains, fever, and arthritis and
heavily used by athletes (13), affects the pituitary–testis axis.
Because of the intrinsic great challenge in identifying endocrine-
disrupting effects of chemicals in the adult human, we performed
a unique combination of three interconnected approaches: (i) a
randomized, controlled clinical trial; (ii) an ex vivo organ model
using adult human testis explants; and (iii) a standardized in vitro
Significance
Concern has been raised over declining male reproductive
health in humans. Our study addresses this issue by extending
data showing antiandrogen effects of analgesics and suggests
that such compounds may be involved in adult male re-
productive problems. Using a unique combination of a ran-
domized, controlled clinical trial and ex vivo and in vitro
approaches, we report a univocal depression of important as-
pects of testicular function, including testosterone production,
after use of over-the-counter ibuprofen. The study shows that
ibuprofen use results in selective transcriptional repression of
endocrine cells in the human testis. This repression results in
the elevation of the stimulatory pituitary hormones, resulting
in a state of compensated hypogonadism, a disorder associated
with adverse reproductive and physical health disorders.

Results
Ibuprofen Affects the Hormonal Balance in Adult Men. We con-
ducted a randomized, controlled clinical trial of ibuprofen ad-
ministration to identify its possible effects on pituitary–gonadal
feedback in young men. During administration, ibuprofen levels
in plasma ranged on average from 25 to 35 μg/mL (∼1.2–1.7 ×
10−4 M); the highest level measured was 100 μg/mL (4.85 × 10−4 M).
The mean of this ibuprofen concentration was in the range mea-
sured after administration of 600 mg of ibuprofen to healthy
volunteers (14). Samples drawn before administration showed that
there were no initial differences between the placebo and ibu-
profen groups for hormones or sex hormone-binding globulin
(SHBG), a liver protein that specifically binds a substantial part of
circulating testosterone (Fig. S1).
We investigated the levels of total testosterone and its direct
downstream metabolic product, 17β-estradiol. Administration of
ibuprofen did not result in any significant changes in the levels of
these two steroid hormones after 14 d or at the last day of ad-
ministration at 44 d (Fig. 1 A and C). The levels of free testos-
terone were subsequently analyzed by using the SHBG levels.
Neither free testosterone nor SHBG levels were affected by
ibuprofen during the administration (Fig. 1 A and C).
The pituitary gonadotropin hormones LH and FSH regulate
the production of testosterone and peptide hormones by acting
on Leydig and Sertoli cells, respectively. The levels of LH in the
ibuprofen group had increased by 23% after 14 d of adminis-
tration (P = 0.05) (Fig. 1A). This increase was even more pro-
nounced at 44 d, at 33% (P = 0.01) (Fig. 1C). While a slight,
nonsignificant increase in the average FSH concentration was
observed at 14 d (+5%) (Fig. 1B), no difference in the average
value of this hormone was seen at 44 d (Fig. 1D). These data
suggested a link between pituitary LH levels and ibuprofen ex-
posure. This assumption was confirmed when we investigated
ibuprofen and LH levels in plasma and found they were signifi-
cantly and positively correlated at 14 d (r = 0.73; P = 0.003) (Fig.
1E). We next calculated the free testosterone/LH ratio in the
men. We found an 18% decrease (P = 0.056) in the ibuprofen
group compared with the placebo group after 14 d (Fig. 1A) and
a 23% decrease (P = 0.02) after 44 d (Fig. 1C). Taken together,
these in vivo data suggest that ibuprofen induced a state of
compensated hypogonadism during the trial, which occurred as
early as 14 d and was maintained until the end of the trial at 44 d.
Inhibin B and anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) are peptide
hormones secreted to the blood from the Sertoli cells. The ad-
ministration of ibuprofen did not change mean inhibin B levels
(Fig. 1 B and D). To examine the stimulatory action of FSH on the
Sertoli cells, we next examined the inhibin B/FSH ratio and found
that it decreased by 4% after 14 d (Fig. 1B) and by 12% at the end
administration at 44 d (Fig. 1D). Importantly, further investigation
of Sertoli cell activity showed that AMH levels decreased signifi-
cantly with ibuprofen administration, by 9% (P = 0.02) after 14 d
(Fig. 1B) and by 7% (P = 0.05) after 44 d compared with the
placebo group (Fig. 1D). The AMH data show that the hypo-
gonadism affected not only Leydig cells but also Sertoli cells and
also occurred as early as 14 d of administration.
Ibuprofen Inhibits Steroidogenesis ex Vivo and in Vitro. To de-
termine the direct effect of ibuprofen on the testis, we next ex-
posed adult testis explants from donors to doses of 10−9–10−4 M,
which corresponded to the oral doses producing mean plasma
levels of 1.2–1.7 × 10−4 M used among the men in the trial (see
above). We first investigated testosterone production after 24 and
48 h of ibuprofen exposure to assess its effects on Leydig cell
steroidogenesis. Inhibition of testosterone levels was significant
and dose-dependent (β = −0.405, P = 0.01 at 24 h and β = −0.664,
P < 0.0001 at 48 h) (Fig. 2A) and was augmented over time (10−4 M
at 24 h and 10−5–10−4 M at 48 h, −40%) (Fig. 2A). Examination of
the effect of ibuprofen exposure on both the Δ4 and Δ5 steroid
pathways (Fig. 2B) showed that it generally inhibited all steroids from
pregnenolone down to testosterone and 17β-estradiol; the produc-
tion of each steroid measured decreased at doses of 10−5–10−4 M.
Under control conditions, production of androstenediol and dehy-
droepiandrosterone (DHEA) was below the limit of detection except
in one experiment with DHEA (Fig. 2B).
We next examined the gene expression involved in testicular
steroidogenesis ex vivo and found that levels of expression of
every gene that we studied except CYP19A1 decreased after
exposure for 48 h compared with controls (Fig. 2C). Suppression
of gene expression concerned the initial conversion of choles-
terol to the final testosterone synthesis. Hence, expression of
genes involved in cholesterol transport to the Leydig cell mito-
chondria was impaired: Compared with controls, TSPO/BZRP
fell significantly after exposure to 10−4 M; StAR expression was
suppressed at both doses of 10−5 and 10−4 M (Fig. 2C); CYP11A1,
CYP17A1, and HSD17B3 were suppressed by 40–50% at doses of
10−5–10−4 M; and HSD3B2 was reduced by about 90%.
The data from the ex vivo testis model showed inhibition of
both the Δ4 and Δ5 steroid pathways. A previous study reported
androsterone levels decreased by 63% among men receiving
400 mg of ibuprofen every 6 h for 4 wk (15), suggesting a possible
inhibitory effect on CYP17A1. We therefore exposed the NCI-
H295R cells of human origin [which, although derived from the
adrenal gland (instead of testis) and from a cancer originating in
the cortex, are considered the best in vitro model of human ste-
roidogenesis according to the Organization for Economic Co-
operation and Development (OECD) (16)] to ibuprofen and, as a
positive control, to the CYP17A1 antagonist abiraterone. The
latter compound is clinically used as an androgen biosynthesis
inhibitor (17). Before testing ibuprofen’s action on steroidogene-
sis, we verified that none of the doses used had a toxic effect on
the NCI-H295R cell line (Fig. S2 A and B). This in vitro work
confirmed the global antagonistic effect of abiraterone on
CYP17A1 (Fig. 3A). In contrast, ibuprofen significantly decreased
androstenedione and other sex steroid levels downstream from
the CYP17A1 lyase activity, including testosterone (Fig. 3 and
Table S1), complementing the results in the ex vivo testis model.
These data therefore reveal that ibuprofen, unlike abiraterone, is
not a general CYP17A1 antagonist. It is noteworthy that the NCI-
295R cell line was less sensitive to ibuprofen than were the ex vivo
cells in the organ model, likely due to its different origin (6, 18).
Measuring the mRNA expression of genes involved in steroido-
genesis in vitro showed that ibuprofen had a profound inhibitory
effect on the expression of these genes (Fig. 3 B–D), consistent with
that seen above in our ex vivo organ model. Taken together, these
data examining effects on the endocrine cells confirm that
ibuprofen-induced changes in the transcriptional machinery were
the likely reason for the inhibition of steroidogenesis.
Ibuprofen Inhibits Leydig Cell Insulin-like Factor 3 in the Adult Human
Testis ex Vivo. In addition to steroids, Leydig cells also produce
insulin-like factor 3 (INSL3) (19). Its production increased at
24 h at the 10−9 M dose and subsequently decreased at the 10−7 M
dose (Fig. 2D). These variations were transient, with no signifi-
cant effect of ibuprofen observed after 48 h. INSL3 expres-
sion decreased by 50% at a dose of 10−4 M, but expression of the
LH receptor, luteinizing hormone/choriogonadotropin receptor
(LHCGR), which is also Leydig cell specific, was not repressed
(Fig. 2E). Nonetheless, overall the changes in gene expression
indicate that the transcriptional machinery behind the endocrine ac-
tion of Leydig cells was most likely impaired by ibuprofen exposure.

 Ibuprofen Impairs Sertoli Cell Function in the Adult Human Testis ex
Vivo. Data from the trial showed that ibuprofen affected Sertoli
cells, inhibiting AMH and decreasing the inhibin B/FSH ratio. Ex
vivo, increasing doses of ibuprofen resulted in an inverse corre-
lation with inhibin B after 24 h (β = −0.467; P = 0.01), although
none of the individual ibuprofen concentrations significantly
inhibited this hormone (Fig. 4A). After 48 h of exposure, however,
ibuprofen doses of 10−7–10−4 M significantly decreased inhibin B
production, resulting in a further significant negative association
between ibuprofen concentrations and inhibin B (β = −0.739, P <
0.0001). AMH production was also negatively correlated with
increasing ibuprofen concentration (β = −0.451; P = 0.01) (Fig.
4B). Accordingly, a dose of 10−4 M repressed gene expression of
AMH and INHBB by ∼35% (Fig. 4C). Together, these data show
that ibuprofen also directly impairs Sertoli cell function ex vivo by
inhibiting transcription. Of note, no significant changes were
found in the gene expression of the Sertoli cell-specific FSH re-
ceptor (FSH-R) or of LAMA5 (Fig. 4C).
Ibuprofen Selectively Affects Peritubular Cells’ Gene Expression in the
Adult Human Testis ex Vivo. Peritubular cells lining the seminifer-
ous wall play an important role in sustaining seminiferous tubule
function (20). The peritubular cells are not broadly characterized
in terms of specific markers. Nevertheless, we investigated the
expression of a few genes that are assigned to these cells. We
found that ibuprofen selectively repressed ACTA2 and MYH-11 by
50%, but two other peritubular cell markers, THY1 and KCNIP4,
did not change significantly (Fig. 5A).
Ibuprofen Spares the Spermatogenic Cells in the Adult Human Testis
ex Vivo. Turning our attention to germ cells in the explants, we
found no significant changes in the expression of genes involved
specifically with spermatogenesis (Fig. 5B). The absence of a
change in the germ cell complement by ibuprofen was confirmed
by staining for caspase 3 after 48 h of exposure: Apoptosis did
not increase significantly in the testis after exposure (Fig. 5 C and
D), and the histopathology of the testis at the highest doses did
not differ from that of controls (Fig. 5D).
Ibuprofen Suppresses Prostaglandin Production in the Adult Human
Testis ex Vivo and in Vitro. As ibuprofen acts specifically on COX
sites of prostaglandin H2 synthase (prostaglandin endoperoxide
synthase or prostaglandin G/H synthase and cyclooxygenase,

 enzymes are widely distributed within the testis (21), we in-
vestigated prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) and E2 (PGE2) in our
culture system. Ibuprofen produced a significant dose-dependent
reduction of PGD2 (β = −0.781; P < 0.0001 at 24 h and
β = −0.797; P < 0.0001 at 48 h) (Fig. 6A) and of PGE2
(β = −0.707; P < 0.0001 and β = −0.627; P < 0.0001, respectively)
(Fig. 6B). PTGS1 and PTGS2 gene expression decreased similarly:
PTGS1 mRNA levels fell significantly by 24 and 48 h (Fig. 6C), and
PTGS2 mRNA was significantly repressed after 48 h of exposure.
These ex vivo data show that ibuprofen suppressed both PTGS
enzyme activity and PTGS gene expression in the adult testis.
To complement our ex vivo model system, we next screened
the human NCI-H295R cell line for prostaglandin production.
This screen showed that the NCI-H295R cells produced de-
tectable levels of prostaglandins, which were decreased dose
dependently with ibuprofen (Fig. 7A). As also shown in the ex-
periments presented above, ibuprofen decreased the expression
of PTGS1 and PTGS2 in the NCI-H295R cell line (Fig. 7B).
Discussion
The pituitary–gonadal axis plays key roles in growth, sex devel-
opment, metabolism, musculoskeletal build-up, strength, mood,
energy, immune system, libido, and reproduction (22–24). Fluctu-
ations in or impaired fine-tuning of the axis can result in a wide
range of endocrine disorders that may be local but severe, e.g., in-
fertility (25), or affect the entire body, as seen with adverse out-
comes involving this axis such as sexual symptoms (4), depression
(26), coronary heart disease/heart attack (27), autoimmune diseases
such as arthritis (28), and diabetes (29, 30). Testosterone forms a
negative feedback loop that inhibits the production of both LH and
gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) in the hypothalamus
(31). While testosterone plays multiple roles outside the testes, the

 extratesticular actions of inhibin B are more subtle, working
primarily to decrease FSH (32). Nonetheless, inhibin B is a key
clinical marker of reproductive health (32). The function of
AMH, also secreted by Sertoli cells, and its regulation through
FSH remain unclear in men (33). It has, however, been shown
that the AMH concentrations are lower in seminal plasma from
patients with azoospermia than from men with normal sperm
levels (32).
Our trial showed that ibuprofen use in men led to (i) elevation
of LH; (ii) a decreased testosterone/LH ratio and, to a lesser
degree, a decreased inhibin B/FSH ratio; and (iii) a reduction in
the levels of the Sertoli cell hormone AMH. The decrease in the
free testosterone/LH ratio resulted primarily from the increased
LH levels, revealing that testicular responsiveness to gonado-
tropins likely declined during the ibuprofen exposure. Our data
from the ex vivo experiments support this notion, indicating that
the observed elevation in LH resulted from ibuprofen’s direct
antiandrogenic action. Accordingly, in the trial the average in-
hibin B levels did not differ significantly in the ibuprofen-treated
men and the control group. This is consistent with a previous
report that men who volunteered to take another nonsteroidal
antiinflammatory drug (NSAID), acetylsalicylic acid, coadminis-
tered with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), which mimics
LH, had lower levels of steroidal hormones than controls exposed
to hCG but not to the analgesic (34).
AMH levels were consistently suppressed by ibuprofen both in
vivo and ex vivo, indicating that this hormone is uncoupled from
gonadotropins in adult men. The ibuprofen suppression of AMH
further demonstrated that the analgesic targeted not only the
Leydig cells but also the Sertoli cells, a feature encountered not
only in the human adult testis but also in the fetal testis (35). It is
noteworthy that ibuprofen repressed the expression of both
AMH and INHBB as well as genes encoding essential proteins
and enzymes involved in both cholesterol transport and ste-
roidogenesis. Thus, ibuprofen displayed broad transcription-
repression abilities involving steroidogenesis, peptide hormones,

 and prostaglandin synthesis. However, these repressive abilities
were selective, as a number of gene-expression patterns were
spared by ibuprofen, namely prostaglandin inhibition in Leydig
cells (CYP19A1 and LHCGR), Sertoli cells (LAMA5 and FSHR),
peritubular cells (KCNIP4 and THY1), and all those investi-
gated in germ cells. Of note, the absence of an effect of ibu-
profen on the expression levels of gonadotropin receptor genes
(LHCGR and FSHR) indicates that the responsiveness of Leydig
cells and Sertoli cells to the action of LH and FSH is likely not
affected by ibuprofen. However, more investigation is required
at this level.
Several compounds have been found to have unintentional
antiandrogenic effects, and these are normally investigated in
connection with fetal male development using rodent models
(36, 37). Our approach, using ibuprofen as an example, dem-
onstrates how a chemical compound, through its effects on the
signaling compounds, can result in changes in the testis at gene
level, resulting in perturbations at higher physiological levels in
the adult human. The analgesics acetaminophen/paracetamol
and ibuprofen have previously been shown to inhibit the post-
exercise response in muscles by repressing transcription (38–40).
However, the striking dual effect of ibuprofen observed here on
both Leydig and Sertoli cells makes this NSAID the chemical
compound, of all the chemical classes considered, with the
broadest endocrine-disturbing properties identified so far in men.
Previous ex vivo studies on adult testis have indeed pointed to an
antiandrogenicity, only on Leydig cells, of phthalates (41), aspirin,
indomethacin (42), and bisphenol A (BPA) and its analogs (43).

 However, ibuprofen’s effects were not restricted to Leydig and
Sertoli cells, as data showed that the expression of genes in
peritubular cells was also affected. Previous studies have shown
that long-term fetal exposure to acetaminophen and acetylsa-
licylic acid in mice and rats targets primordial germ cell pro-
liferation by blocking RNA synthesis and thus leads to reduced
follicle reservoir and subsequent decreased fertility in adult-
hood (44–46). By contrast, in the present study using human
testes, germ cells were the only cell category not altered by this
analgesic in our ex vivo culture conditions. However, it must be
noted that our ex vivo model systems can be used only for short-
term exposure. Therefore, determining the effect on men that
sustained exposure to ibuprofen would generate in terms of
sperm production and fertility would require designing specific
and challenging experiment(s). It is noteworthy that exposure
to analgesics in men has been associated with increased time to
pregnancy (47).
An important question is the exact relationship between the
prostaglandin-inhibitory actions of ibuprofen and its effects on
testosterone and gene expression. This has been investigated
previously in studies on rodent and human testicular develop-
ment, which showed no correlation between the endocrine-
disruptive effects of analgesics and their prostaglandin-inhibitory
actions (6, 48, 49). However, in the present study using testes
from adult men, the suppression of androgens and prostaglan-
dins occurred in parallel, and, because for several decades
prostaglandins have been known to be involved in male re-
production (50), a link between the endocrine-disruptive prop-
erties of ibuprofen and the prostaglandin-inhibitory action of
NSAIDs in the adult testis cannot be excluded.
In the clinical setting, compromised Leydig cell function
resulting in increased insensitivity to LH is defined as compen-
sated hypogonadism (4), an entity associated with all-cause
mortality (5). Therefore, investigating ibuprofen-induced com-
pensatory hypogonadism is crucial, as this clinical state is gen-
erally associated with smoking and aging (4, 51). Moreover,
compensated hypogonadic men present with an increased like-
lihood of reproductive, cognitive, and physical symptoms (4, 52–
54). Further characterizations of the state of compensated
hypogonadism induced by ibuprofen, which was already estab-
lished after 14 d of ibuprofen administration, are therefore im-
portant in determining the potential effects on healthy young
men. Several reports have stressed the high level of long-term
analgesic use among both amateur (55) and professional ath-
letes; ibuprofen has been favored in this use and abuse (56–59).
Of note, an inverse relationship was recently reported between

 endurance exercise training and male sexual libido, but the
possibility that medication uptake might interfere in this obser-
vation could not be totally excluded (22). Moreover, ibuprofen
appears to be the preferred pharmaceutical analgesic for long-
term chronic pain and arthritis (60). Therefore it is also of
concern that men with compensated hypogonadism may even-
tually progress to overt primary hypogonadism, which is char-
acterized by low circulating testosterone and prevalent symptoms
including reduced libido, reduced muscle mass and strength, and
depressed mood and fatigue (4, 60, 61).
Materials and Methods
In Vivo Intervention Trial.
Design and participants. The in vivo study was designed as a double-blinded,
placebo-controlled, randomized intervention trial in which ibuprofen or
placebo was administered to subjects for 2 wk before and 30 d after a single
exercise session. Staff not involved in the project prepared and distributed the
medication in boxes weekly. Study personnel and participants were blinded
to treatment, and all later analyses were performed blinded to the treatment
type, participant, and time point. The study was part of a broader in-
vestigation also focusing on muscle biopsies, collected on days 0, 2, 7, and
30 postexercise, a subset of which is described elsewhere (62).
The study protocol was in compliance with the Helsinki Declaration, was
approved by the Regional Scientific Ethical Committees of Copenhagen in
Denmark (Ref: HD-2008-074), and was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (no.
NCT00832663). The study recruited 31 healthy white men, age 18–35 y. Sub-
jects were included after an interview, a questionnaire assessing physical ac-
tivity status, and the results of a screening blood sample. Exclusion criteria
included body mass index above 30, knee injuries, peptic ulcers, signs of liver
or kidney dysfunction, and participation in regular physical activity (especially
strength training) apart from cycling as a means of transport. All individuals
provided written informed consent to participate in the study. Subsequently,
the subjects were assigned to either a placebo (17 subjects) or ibuprofen
(14 subjects) group; the groups were matched for age, height, and weight.
Supplementation. One group of subjects received ibuprofen, 2 × 600 mg/d,
(Ibumetin; Nycomed Denmark Aps) for a period of 6 wk, from 14 d before to
4 wk after the electrical stimulation exercise. Ibuprofen was detected only in
participants to whom ibuprofen was distributed and only after administra-
tion began. The second group received placebo pills (which were visually
indistinguishable from the ibuprofen pills) over the same period. Subjects
received the medication in Medidos No. 1 boxes (KiBodan A/S), which were
refilled every week. To verify compliance, ibuprofen levels in the blood were
determined by HPLC at every blood-sampling time point (see below). Ad-
ditionally, to monitor liver and kidney function, blood samples were ana-
lyzed for creatine, C-reactive protein, alkaline phosphates, and total
cholesterol during the study. No subjects reported any adverse signs of
taking the medication, nor did any blood parameters indicate or suggest
adverse effects.
Blood samples and hormonal analysis. A 40-mL blood sample was collected from
the antecubital vein of the nondominant arm when subjects arrived at the
laboratory for screening. Samples were also taken at 3 and 2 wk before
exercise (days −21 and −14), on the day of exercise before the exercise (day
0), after exercise (+2 h; day 0.1), and subsequently at 2, 4, 7, and 30 d after
exercise. Hence, ibuprofen and placebo administration was ongoing for
samples drawn on day 0, 0+2 h, 2, 4, 7, and 30. In the present study, we
focused on samples drawn on day 0 after 14 d of supplementation. Plasma
samples were stored at −80 °C until being assayed. The samples were ana-
lyzed for LH, FSH, testosterone, 17β-estradiol, AMH, inhibin B, and SHBG, as
previously described in Aksglaede et al. (63), and ibuprofen as previously
described in Farrar et al. (64). Of note, the LH measurements of one subject
in the placebo group were aberrant and were discarded, thus decreasing the
n value from 17 to 16.
Ex Vivo Organ Model: Testis Explant Assay. To determine the direct effect of
ibuprofen on adult human testis physiology, we used a validated organ
model assay (Testis Explant Assay) (65). Testes were obtained from prostate
cancer patients who had not undergone any antihormonal treatment or
from multiorgan donors (average age 46.9 ± 4.4 y). The protocol was ap-
proved by the local ethics committee (Agence de la Biomédine; authoriza-
tion no. PFS09-015), and informed consent was obtained from all donors or
their next of kin.
After collection of each testis, the organ was placed at 4 °C and rapidly
processed for experimentation. Observation by transillumination allowed us
to discard the rare testes not displaying spermatogenesis. Four 3-mm3 testis
explants were placed onto a polyethylene terephthalate insert (Falcon
Labware) at the interface of air in 1 mL of DMEM (Sigma-Aldrich) in a well of
a 12-well plate. The medium for exposure experiments contained 0.1%
DMSO as a control and ibuprofen at different concentrations (purity >99%)
(Sigma-Aldrich) in 0.1% DMSO. Four wells were analyzed for each condition.
Exposures lasted 24 or 48 h, with a total medium change at 24 h, in a hu-
midified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 34 °C. The culture medium was
then collected and stored at −80 °C. On the day of collection, three testis
explants for each culture condition were randomly selected and fixed in
neutral buffer, 4% formaldehyde, or Bouin’s fixative for 2 h at 4 °C, em-
bedded in paraffin, sliced into 5.0-μm-thick sections, and stored at 4 °C
until immunostaining.
Hormone levels were assayed in duplicate in the culture medium. Tes-
tosterone levels were assayed with a specific RIA (Beckman Coulter). The
intra- and interassay coefficients of variation were ≤8.6 and 11.9%, re-
spectively. Control testis explants produced an average of 10.26 ± 2.50 ng
testosterone per milliliter of explant after 24 h of culture and 8.47 ± 2.16 ng
testosterone per milliliter of explant after 48 h of culture. INSL3 production
was assayed with a commercial RIA (Phoenix France). Each sample was di-
luted twofold in RIA buffer before RIA. The intra- and interassay coefficients
of variation were ≤15 and 7%, respectively, and the lower limit of detection
was 20.17 pg/mL. Control testis explants produced an average of 0.29 ±
0.25 ng INSL3 per milliliter of explant after 24 h of culture and 0.20 ± 0.21 ng
INSL3 per milliliter of explant after 48 h of culture. Inhibin B was assayed
with a commercial ELISA kit (Beckman Coulter) according to the manufac-
turer’s instructions. Each sample was diluted twofold in sample diluent so-
lution before reactions. The intra- and interassay coefficients of variation for
serum samples were ≤5.6 and 7.6%, respectively. Control testis explants
produced an average of 570.43 ± 78.50 ng inhibin B per milliliter of
explant after 24 h of culture and 529.44 ± 79.17 ng inhibin B per milliliter of
explant after 48 h of culture. PGD2 and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) were assayed
by an ELISA method (Cayman Chemical Company), as was AMH (Immunotech).
RNA was extracted from testes with the NucleoSpin RNA II kit (Macherey-
Nagel) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and then was pre-
cipitated. Each total RNA sample (250 ng) was reverse transcribed with the
Iscript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad). Quantitative PCR was performed
according to the manufacturer’s instructions with iTaq Universal SYBR Green
Supermix (Bio-Rad) and a 2.5-μL cDNA template in a CFX384 Touch Real-
Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad). The amplification program was as
follows: an initial denaturation of 3 min at 95 °C; 40 cycles of 10-s de-
naturation at 95 °C; and 30 s at 62 °C for annealing and extension. Dissoci-
ation curves were produced with the thermal melting profile performed
after the last PCR cycle. To avoid amplification of contaminating genomic
DNA, primer pairs were selected on two different exons. Bzw1 and GusB
mRNA were used as internal controls for normalization. Results were cal-
culated by the ΔΔCT method as n-fold differences in target gene expression
with respect to the reference gene and the calibration sample.
To analyze steroidogenesis in the explants, we performed solid-phase
extraction (SPE) with C18 cartridges, reagents, and solvents from Solvent
Documentation Synthesis. Standard reference steroids were from Sigma.
Deuterated internal standards were from Steraloids. Quantification was
performed by isotopic dilution. Samples were spiked with 400 pg of internal
standards (etiocholanolone-d5, 17a-testosterone-d3, dihydrotestosterone-
d3, 19-androstenedione-d3, progesterone-d9, 17a-methyltestosterone-d3,
and 17b-estradiol-d3). Samples were applied to a C18 SPE column (2 g sta-
tionary phase) previously conditioned with 10 mL methanol and 10 mL water.
The column was washed with water (5 mL) and then with cyclohexane (5 mL),
and the steroids were eluted with methanol (10 mL). The extracts were dried
(N2, 458C), and 400 pg of external standard (norgestrel) was added. De-
rivatization procedures and measurements in GC-MS/MS in electronization
mode were performed as previously described (66, 67).
Cells were labeled with the primary rabbit antibody directed against
cleaved caspase-3 (1/100; Cell Signaling) (41, 42) to enable detection of cells
undergoing apoptosis in the explants. Slides were then scanned with a
NanoZoomer slide scanner (Hamamatsu Photonics). Caspase-3+ cells were
counted by ImageJ software, and the results were expressed as percentages
of the control values.
In Vitro: NCI-H295R Cell Line. The NCI-H295R human adrenocortical carcinoma
cell line was obtained from ATCC (CRL-2128), and experiments aiming at
completing the ex vivo experiments using human adult testis explants were
conducted in accordance with OECD guidelines (16). Steroids were analyzed
after exposure to ibuprofen, abiraterone, and PGD2 (Sigma-Aldrich). Toxicity
was evaluated with the Alamar Blue assay (Sigma-Aldrich). Deuterated ste-
roid analogs were obtained for analysis from CDN Isotopes and Toronto

 Research Chemicals, and derivatization quality-control standards (7b-17β-
estradiol-17-acetate), instrument control standards (estrone-3-methyl ether), and
derivatization reagents (N-trimethylsilylimidazole, N-methyl-N-trimethylsilyl-
trifluoroacetamide, and 1,4-dithioerythritol) were obtained from Sigma-
Aldrich. Steroid extraction and the subsequent quantification of steroid
hormones were performed according to Holm et al. (68).
For prostaglandin secretion analysis, the NIC-H295R cells were plated in 12-
well plates and were exposed overnight; the global prostaglandin synthesis
was evaluated immediately afterward with a Prostaglandin Screening ELISA
Kit (Cayman Chemical Company).
For transcriptional analysis with RT-qPCR, RNA was isolated from cells with
the All Prep DNA/RNA kit (Qiagen). RNA integrity was measured on a
NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific), and only 260/
280 and 260/230 ratios >2.0 were accepted for further processing. Quanti-
tative PCR was performed as previously described.
Statistical Analysis. For the trial, each individual’s samples were normalized
by division by the mean of the baseline samples drawn before the in-
tervention. Hence, samples from each volunteer were normalized with the
individual’s own baseline values before the administration. Unpaired Stu-
dent t tests were used to compare the placebo and ibuprofen groups after
14 and 44 d of administration. For the ex vivo experiments, data were
compared using the Mann–Whitney U test and slopes with P values and
Spearman correlation when indicated. For in vitro cell experiments, analysis
was performed with one-way ANOVA followed by a post hoc Dunnett’s
multiple comparison test. All data are expressed as mean ± SEM, and dif-
ferences were considered statistically significant when P ≤ 0.05.
