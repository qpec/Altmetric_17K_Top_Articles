 INTRODUCTION
The timeliness of cancer diagnosis in 
patients who present with symptoms has 
long been a cause of public, professional, 
and political concern. The result has 
been an increasing focus on achieving 
earlier diagnosis,1,2 supported by growing 
evidence for associations between time 
to diagnosis and clinical and patient 
experience outcomes,3,4 and evidence of 
substantial variation in clinical primary care 
practice.5 Differences in cancer outcomes 
between the UK and other comparable 
health systems are thought to partly 
reflect differences in diagnostic timeliness, 
and insights into processes that might 
underpin these differences have been 
generated through the International Cancer 
Benchmarking Partnership.6
Forming part of the National Awareness 
and Early Diagnosis Initiative,7 the 
first English National Audit of Cancer 
Diagnosis in Primary Care (NACDPC) was 
undertaken in 2009–2010 in order to gain 
an understanding of the diagnostic process 
in primary care for patients subsequently 
diagnosed with cancer.8 It included 
information on 18 879 patients diagnosed 
with cancer, identified from the registers of 
nearly 1200 practices, and provided detailed 
information on the primary care pathways 
to cancer diagnosis. 
The Achieving World Class Cancer 
Outcomes cancer strategy 2015–2020 
contained a commitment to a second 
national audit of cancer diagnosis, alongside 
specific recommendations for clinical 
practice and the organisation of diagnostic 
services.9 It suggested that precautionary 
‘safety 
netting’10,11 
becomes 
more 
established and that direct access for GPs 
to diagnostic tests be increased, additionally 
including a target for achieving diagnostic 
resolution (cancer diagnosed or ruled out) 
in most patients within 28 days of referral.9 
Building on the 2009–2010 NACDPC, a 
National Cancer Diagnosis Audit (NCDA) 
was formulated as a collaborative initiative 
between the key UK agencies in cancer 
diagnosis. 
The aim of the NCDA was to generate 
a detailed understanding of the diagnostic 
process for cancer in primary care for 
patients who were diagnosed during 
2014. At a national level, it would provide a 
baseline against which the impact of large-

Abstract
Background
Continual improvements in diagnostic 
processes are needed to minimise the 
proportion of patients with cancer who 
experience diagnostic delays. Clinical audit is a 
means of achieving this.
Aim
To characterise key aspects of the diagnostic 
process for cancer and to generate baseline 
measures for future re-audit.
Design and setting
Clinical audit of cancer diagnosis in general 
practices in England.
Method
Information on patient and tumour 
characteristics held in the English National 
Cancer Registry was supplemented by 
information from GPs in participating 
practices. Data items included diagnostic 
timepoints, patient characteristics, and clinical 
management.
Results
Data were collected on 17 042 patients with 
a new diagnosis of cancer during 2014 from 
439 practices. Participating practices were 
similar to non-participating ones, particularly 
regarding population age, urban/rural location, 
and practice-based patient experience 
measures. The median diagnostic interval for 
all patients was 40 days (interquartile range 
[IQR] 15–86 days). Most patients were referred 
promptly (median primary care interval 5 days 
[IQR 0–27 days]). Where GPs deemed diagnostic 
delays to have occurred (22% of cases), patient, 
clinician, or system factors were responsible in 
26%, 28%, and 34% of instances, respectively. 
Safety netting was recorded for 44% of patients. 
At least one primary care-led investigation was 
carried out for 45% of patients. Most patients 
(76%) had at least one existing comorbid 
condition; 21% had three or more. 
Conclusion
The findings identify avenues for quality 
improvement activity and provide a baseline 
for future audit of the impact of 2015 National 
Institute for Health and Care Excellence 
guidance on management and referral of 
suspected cancer

 scale interventions, such as the revised 
2015 National Institute for Health and Care 
Excellence (NICE) guidance for recognition 
and referral of patients with suspected 
cancer and the new national cancer strategy, 
could be re-audited in future.9,11 At a practice 
level, the indicators selected would map to 
cancer standards and guidelines in order to 
support quality improvement initiatives.
METHOD
Data
After excluding non-melanoma skin cancer, 
all incident malignant cancer cases among 
England residents in 2014 (n = 296 231) 
were assigned to the general practice in 
which they were registered at the time of 
their cancer diagnosis, using information 
from the Hospital Episodes Statistics and 
Cancer Waiting Times datasets (which hold 
patient administration and cancer target 
compliance data, respectively).
Participation in the NCDA was voluntary 
and promoted through the Royal College of 
General Practitioners’ (RCGP) website and 
e-newsletters to its members, and through 
Cancer Research UK and Macmillan 
Cancer Support primary care engagement 
processes. Once registered and verified, 
practices had access, via a secure web 
portal developed by Public Health England’s 
(PHE) National Cancer Registration and 
Analysis Service (NCRAS), to a list of all 
patients who were diagnosed with cancer 
in 2014 while registered at their practice. 
Verified GPs and other practice health 
professionals could then enter primary care 
data on the patient’s characteristics, place 
of presentation and symptoms presented, 
primary care-led investigations, the number 
of pre-referral consultations, the referral 
pathway, whether there was evidence of 
safety netting, and any diagnostic delays 
incurred. The audit portal remained open 
from September 2016 to February 2017.
Except for dates, all responses were 
selected from drop-down menus with 
predefined answers. Categories of avoidable 
delay were based on a taxonomy previously 
generated through analysis of free-text 
responses contained in the NACDPC.12 
Practices could verify screening-detection 
status but were not required to provide data 
on these cases. A payment of £10 per tumour 
record was given to participating practices 
that returned information on 95% or more 
of their NCDA patients (365 practices). Some 
clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) had 
encouraged participation through local 
incentive schemes before this funding 
became available and were later reimbursed.
Analysis
The authors describe key variables by sex, 
age group (0–24, 25–49, 50–64, 65–74, 75–84 
and ≥85 years), and cancer site (for the 20 
sites comprising >1% of the sample: bladder, 
brain, breast, cancer of unknown primary, 
colon, endometrial, leukaemia, liver, lung, 
lymphoma, melanoma, multiple myeloma, 
oesophageal, oral/oropharyngeal, ovarian, 
pancreatic, prostate, rectal, renal, stomach 
[all n ≥265]). The distribution of sex, age, 
stage at diagnosis, and cancer site of the 
NCDA cohort was compared with the 2014 
national cancer registration statistics.13 
Similarly, participating and non-participating 
practices were compared in respect of their 
key characteristics, key aspects of patients’ 
experience of primary care (access, continuity, 
satisfaction, and doctor communication) as 
reported by the 2013–2014 NHS General 
Practice Patient Survey (GPPS), https://
gp-patient.co.uk, and rates of use of the 
2-week wait (TWW) referrals for suspected 
cancer and related metrics (in England, 
clinical guidelines enable GPs to refer 
patients for specialist assessment within 
2 weeks when certain symptoms are present 
and cancer is a suspected diagnosis).11 
Primary care-led investigations were 
grouped into blood, urinary, imaging, 
endoscopy, and other tests. The number 
of pre-referral consultations and also the 
number of comorbidities were categorised 
as 0, 1, 2, and ≥3. The data from patients 
with screen-detected cancers are reported 
separately (given in tables as ‘Screening’, 
n = 1006).
The authors focus on three diagnostic 
intervals: the primary care interval (PCI), 
the diagnostic interval (DI), and the time 
from referral to the date the patient was 
How this fits in
Unlike most previous studies, the 
National Cancer Diagnosis Audit has 
collected primary care referral data for a 
comparatively large and population-based 
cohort of patients with cancer
. The audit 
aims to further understand the patient 
pathway from primary care to diagnosis, 
and to highlight where improvements can 
be made, shortening the time interval from 
presentation to diagnosis. It also provides 
a baseline for future audits to assess the 
impact of the 2015 National Institute for 
Health and Care Excellence guidelines on 
the recognition and referral of patients with 
suspected cancer
. The authors summarise 
key methodological aspects of this project 
and its principal findings.

 informed they had cancer, calculated for 
patients with available-date data. The PCI 
was defined as the number of days from 
first presentation with symptoms deemed 
to be relevant to the subsequent diagnosis 
of cancer to the date of first referral from 
primary care for suspected cancer, and the 
DI as the number of days from first relevant 
presentation to the date of diagnosis, as 
registered by NCRAS.
Interval times of <0 and >730 days 
were excluded, consistent with previous 
literature,14 or ‘interval’ hereafter. The 
median (50th), together with the 25th and 
75th centiles are described, along with the 
percentage of patients who had a primary 
care interval or diagnostic interval >60 or 
90 days (for PCI and DI), or >28 days (for 
time from referral to the date the patient 
was informed).
RESULTS
The authors report key results in this paper, 
with more detailed tables provided at www.

Sample characteristics
A total of 439 practices submitted data 
during the audit period, representing 
5% of all (approximately 8000) English 
practices. During quality assurance, 22 
patient records were excluded, chiefly 
because they represented duplicates or 
pre-2014 diagnoses. The final sample 
included 17 042 patients (6% of all cancers 
diagnosed in 2014 in England). Of those, 
50% of patients were male, the median 
age was 69 years, and the most numerous 
cancer sites were female breast (16%), 
lung (13%), prostate (13%), and colon/rectal 
cancer (12%) (Table 1). Completeness of

 were housebound or lived in a care home, 
and 10% had communication difficulties. 
Only 24% of all patients had no recorded 
comorbidities before diagnosis, while 21% 
had ≥3. The most common comorbidities 
were hypertension, cardiovascular disease, 
and arthritis/musculoskeletal disease (38%, 
21%, and 18%, respectively [Table 2]). 
Patient and practice comparisons 
Patients included in the NCDA were 
representative of the 2014 national incident 
cohort in respect of sex, age, and cancer 
site.13 Participating and non-participating 
practices were similar regarding the 
age profile of registered patients, but 
participating practices were somewhat 
larger (median 8318 versus 6197 listed 
patients) and had slightly fewer patients 
per full-time equivalent GP (median 1466 
versus 1673) (Table 3). There were relatively 
fewer participating practices in the least 
and most deprived quintiles. Participating 
and 
non-participating 
practices 
had 
similar patient experience scores, though 
differences were significant given the large 
sample size. The median rate of TWW 
referrals for suspected cancers (n per 
100 000 population per year) was higher in 
participating practices compared with non-
participating ones, though conversion and 
detection rates were similar
.
Presentation, consultations, and referrals
Most patients (72%) first presented at the GP 
surgery or had a home visit. Of these patients,

British Journal of General Practice, January 2018  e68
 11 539 (94%) had at least one recorded 
symptom. A small proportion (n = 1176, 7%) 
of patients first presented to A&E. 
Among patients with a consultation 
(n = 12 369, 73% of all patients), 74% had 
fewer than three consultations and 26% had 
three or more. The most common recorded 
reason for multiple (>3) consultations was 
symptoms suggestive of a different initial 
diagnosis (n = 1684, 11%) or comorbidity 
‘blurring the picture’ (n = 851, 5%).
Approximately 52% of patients were 
referred through the TWW route: this 
percentage was lowest in the 0–24 age 
group (Table 1), and varied greatly by cancer 
site, ranging from 9% (brain cancer) to 78% 
(endometrial cancer). 
In total, 2818 patients had an emergency 
referral (17% overall, but ranging from 0.5% 
for melanoma to 65% for brain cancer 
[Table 1]). Of those patients, 1326 (48%) 
had self-referred to A&E/hospital (26% of 
2818 patients without any previous relevant 
GP consultations, 11% while waiting for 
referral/investigation arranged by the GP, 
and 11% having previously consulted the GP 
but not awaiting previously arranged tests 
or referrals) and 1286 patients (47%) were 
referred to A&E/hospital as an emergency 
by the GP or out-of-hours service (20% 
of 2818 patients without previous relevant 
GP consultations, 8% while awaiting to be 
assessed in hospital following referral, and 
19% having previously consulted the GP but 
not awaiting previously arranged tests or 
referrals) (5% other reason). The results for 
the emergency referrals are not in a table 
within the main paper but will be supplied 
in the supplementary tables hosted on 
the following webpage: www.ncin.org.uk/
collecting_and_using_data/.
Intervals and avoidable delays
The median PCI was 5 days (interquartile 
range [IQR] 0–27 days), with 8% of patients 
having a primary care interval longer than 
90 days (Table 4). Females with breast cancer 
had the shortest PCI (median 0 days, IQR 
0–0 days), whereas patients with multiple 
myeloma had the longest (median 23.5 days, 
IQR 4–57 days). The median DI for all patients 
was 40 days (IQR 15–86 days). Patients with 
breast cancer also had the shortest DI 
(median 14 days, IQR 10–19 days), whereas 
those with prostate cancer had a median 
DI of 55.5 days (IQR 29–126 days). The time 
from referral to being told the diagnosis of 
cancer exceeded 28 days in 54% of patients: 
19% of patients with breast cancer having an 
interval longer than 28 days compared with 
74% of melanoma patients. 
For one in five patients the GP considered 
there to be an avoidable delay in the patient 
receiving their diagnosis, varying from 7% 
(breast) to 34% (stomach) (Table 5). Delays 
were most frequently attributed to the patient, 
primary/secondary care clinician, and system 
factors (26%, 28%, and 34%, respectively).
Investigations and safety netting
Primary care-led investigation before 
referral was used in 45% of all patients, 
ranging from 3% (breast cancer) to 76% 
(prostate cancer) (Table 6). For 44% of 
patients, there was evidence in the clinical 
record that safety netting had been 
used, with limited variation by patient

aIf there was a perceived avoidable delay in the patient receiving their diagnosis, the following questions gathered 
information about the nature of that delay, considering three key dimensions: where it occurred, the stage of the 
diagnostic process during which it occurred, and to whom or what factor it was attributable. Delay was defined 
as an unnecessary prolongation of the time to reach a diagnosis that has potentially adverse consequences on 
outcomes. bScreening and not applicable cases are excluded from the avoidable delay category. Percentage values 
relate to observations with non-missing information (that is, excluding ‘not-known’). This is to prevent under-
reporting of the proportion of the known categories by assuming that the not known cases are missing at random 
and therefore evenly distributed among the known groups.

cancer site. 
DISCUSSION
Summary
About one in 20 English general practices 
participated in a major national audit 
initiative providing opportunities for targeted 
significant event analysis, reflective learning, 
and action planning, and additionally 
generating detailed information about how 
patients with cancer were diagnosed. 
The 
findings 
provide 
the 
most 
detailed and accurate picture to date 
about the diagnostic process in a large, 
representative, nationwide population of 
patients with cancer
. Overall, though, the 
median diagnosis interval was 40 days with 
a median primary care interval of 5 days.
Strengths and limitations
The key strength of the NCDA is the collection 
of detailed data on the diagnostic process 
by GPs, based on in-depth understanding 
of their patients, the detailed information 
included in the primary care patient record, 
and application of clinical judgement. The 
audit employed a population-based design, 
allowing for direct comparability of patients 
included with those not included in the 
audit. It linked rigorous case ascertainment 
and staging data with information unique to 
the primary care record and not available 
without direct extraction after expert clinical 
scrutiny.
Though both the included patients 
and participating practices were largely 
representative, participating practices may 
differ from non-participating practices 
in important aspects of the diagnostic 
process for which no comparative data 
exist (for example, in how often they use 
safety netting). Therefore, caution is needed 
when interpreting the findings as nationally 
representative, though comparisons of 
other characteristics of participating and 
non-participating practices are reassuring. 
Clinical judgement is inherently needed 
for certain data items (for example, to 
establish the date of the ‘first consultation 
with relevant symptoms’ for a patient 
subsequently diagnosed with cancer, 
particularly in patients with comorbidity). 
Therefore, the assignment of first relevant 
consultation 
(and 
related 
diagnostic 
intervals) can potentially contain errors. 
It should be acknowledged that clarity 
or vagueness of presenting symptoms 
may influence both the completeness 
and accuracy of how they are recorded 
in primary care records and the ability 
of auditing GPs to accurately extract and 
record this information. Validation studies 
(involving multiple raters) in sub-samples 
of patients would be merited. Another 
limitation is the degree of missing data, 
particularly regarding diagnostic interval 
measures and the assessment of whether 
delays have occurred (Tables 4 and 5).
Comparison with existing literature
This English (2014) NCDA builds on previous 
related initiatives in England (NACDPC 
2009–2010),8 Scotland (2006–2008),15 and 
Denmark.16 It is complemented by nearly 
synchronous audits in both Scotland and 
North Wales. 
The findings presented here reaffirm 
previous evidence on key determinants of 
variation in the measures and markers of 
diagnostic timeliness, particularly in respect 
of cancer site, with patients subsequently 
diagnosed with cancers characterised 
by non-specific symptom signatures (for 
example, lung, colon, stomach, and multiple 
myeloma) typically having longer primary 
care intervals and higher percentage of 
multiple pre-referral consultations.17–19 
Furthermore, we demonstrate that this 
variation by cancer site also applies to 
the soon-to-be-implemented 28-day faster 
diagnosis standard (from referral to receipt 
of diagnosis)9 and that performance in 2014 
falls well short of the proposed 95% target 
for all sites.
The NCDA data provide information on 
referral type; this is analogous but not 
directly comparable with diagnostic route 
as described by the Routes to Diagnosis 
data.20 Nonetheless, the proportion of 
patients with an emergency referral type 
in the NCDA was of similar order to that 
of patients being diagnosed through an 
emergency presentation according to the 
Routes to Diagnosis data for 2014 (17% 
and 20%, respectively).21 In about one 
in four emergency referrals the patient 
had not previously consulted with a GP, a 
finding consistent with other evidence,22,23 
and 19% were missed opportunities for 
earlier diagnosis (associated predictor: 
no prior GP contact (OR = 3.89; 95% CI 
2.14 to 7.09). In the NCDA population, 52% 
of all patients were diagnosed following a 
TWW referral. The total number of TWW 
referrals increased by 71% in the relevant 
5-year period 2009/2010 to 2014/2015, 
though the proportion of those receiving a 
cancer diagnosis decreased from 10.8% to 
8.2%.24

aPatients could have had >1 investigation. Each investigation group has been counted once, therefore multiple blood tests are counted as blood test x1. bNumber of investigations 
include not applicable and screening patients. Percentage values relate to observations with non-missing information (that is, excluding ‘not-known’). This is to prevent under-
reporting of the proportion of the known categories by assuming that the not-known cases are missing at random and therefore evenly distributed among the known groups.
subsequent initiatives to improve cancer 
diagnosis, such as the 2015 NICE guidance 
on recognition and referral of suspected 
cancer11 and the implementation of the 
Achieving World Class Cancer Outcomes 
Cancer Strategy 2015–2020,9,25 can be 
assessed. It provides pointers to where 
implementation efforts might best be 
directed, for example, in achieving the 
28-day standard from referral to diagnosis. 
It appears that, despite efforts since 2012 to 
increase access to specialist investigations 
such as imaging or endoscopy, these are 
not widely ordered by GPs for patients 
subsequently diagnosed with cancer, who 
are however investigated after a specialist 
referral.26
Individual 
practice 
feedback 
has 
already been provided along with quality 
improvement initiatives including the Quality 
Improvement toolkit from the RCGP and 
Cancer Research UK, specifically targeted 
at the NCDA,27 and completion of cycles of 
audit. The novel methodology developed for 
this audit also permits continuous large-
scale participation by practices in the future.
