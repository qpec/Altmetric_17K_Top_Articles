IMPORTANCE Access to specialists such as dermatologists is often limited for Medicaid
enrollees. Teledermatology has been promoted as a potential solution; however, its effect on
access to care at the population level has rarely been assessed.
OBJECTIVES To evaluate the effect of teledermatology on the number of Medicaid enrollees
who received dermatology care and to describe which patients were most likely to be
referred to teledermatology.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Claims data from a large California Medicaid managed
care plan that began offering teledermatology as a covered service in April 2012 were
analyzed. The plan enrolled 382 801 patients in California’
s Central Valley, including 108 480
newly enrolled patients who obtained coverage after the implementation of the Affordable
Care Act. Rates of dermatology visits by patients affiliated with primary care practices that
referred patients to teledermatology and those that did not were compared. Data were
collected from April 1, 2012, through December 31, 2014, and assessed from March 1 to
October 15, 2015.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The percentage of patients with at least 1 visit to a
dermatologist (including in-person and teledermatology visits) and total visits with
dermatologists (including in-person and teledermatology visits) per 1000 patients.
RESULTS Of the 382 801 patients enrolled for at least 1 day from 2012 to 2014, 8614 (2.2%)
had 1 or more visits with a dermatologist. Of all patients who visited a dermatologist, 48.5%
received care via teledermatology. Among the patients newly enrolled in Medicaid, 75.7%
(1474 of 1947) of those who visited a dermatologist received care via teledermatology.
Primary care practices that engaged in teledermatology had a 63.8% increase in the fraction
of patients visiting a dermatologist (vs 20.5% in other practices; P < .01). Compared with
in-person dermatology, teledermatology served more patients younger vs older than 17 years
(2600 of 4427 [58.7%] vs 1404 of 4187 [33.5%]), male patients (1849 of 4427 [41.8%] vs
1526 of 4187 [36.4%]), nonwhite patients (2779 of 4188 [66.4%] vs 1844 of 3478 [53.0%]),
and individuals without comorbid conditions (1795 of 2464 [72.8%] vs 1978 of 3024
[65.4%]) (P < .001 for all comparisons). Conditions managed across settings varied;
teledermatology physicians were more likely to care for viral skin lesions and acne (3405 of
7287 visits [46.7%]), whereas in-person dermatologists were more likely to care for psoriasis
and skin neoplasms (10 062 of 27 347 visits [36.8%]).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The offering of teledermatology appeared to improve access
to dermatology care among Medicaid enrollees and played an especially important role for
the newly enrolled.

A
ccess to specialists such as dermatologists is limited in
the United States. In dermatology, this is due to a short-
ageofdermatologistsandgeographicmisdistribution.1,2
Access is particularly limited among patients with Medicaid
coverage and those treated by safety net primary care
professionals.1 Many dermatologists do not accept new Med-
icaid patients,3 and Medicaid patients make up a signifi-
cantly smaller fraction of dermatologists’patient population
than would be expected based on the number of Medicaid en-
rolleesintheUnitedStates.ThosewithMedicaidinsurancealso
have to wait longer than privately insured patients to obtain
appointments.4
Teledermatology, defined as the delivery of dermatology
careatadistanceusingtelecommunicationstechnologies,may
improve access. Dermatology is well suited to telehealth tech-
nology because the visual presentation of a disease is critical
for the diagnosis and management of skin conditions. Teleder-
matology is classified into several types including (1) store and
forward teledermatology, in which digital images and clinical
information are captured and transmitted to dermatologists
for asynchronous review, and (2) synchronous (interactive)
video visits. Furthermore, teledermatology can use a consul-
tative model (health care professional to health care profes-
sional) or a direct care model (health care professional to
patient).2 Consultative store and forward teledermatology, in
which a primary care physician obtains a consultation from a
remotely located dermatologist, is one of the most common
forms of telemedicine.2,5 In theory, teledermatology can im-
prove access by bringing dermatologists to underserved com-
munities and decreasing travel time for patients. Prior litera-
ture on teledermatology has demonstrated high rates of
diagnostic accuracy, diagnostic concordance, and patient and
health care professional satisfaction.2,6 However, the effect of
teledermatology on access to care at the population level has
rarely been assessed.
Our goals were to address this gap in knowledge and as-
sess the effect of a single teledermatology initiative to im-
prove access to care among Medicaid enrollees. This initia-
tive focused on San Joaquin County in California’
s Central
Valley, which has fewer dermatologists per capita than the na-
tional mean (1.2 vs 3.6 per 100 000 population).7,8 To im-
prove access to dermatologists, Health Plan of San Joaquin
(HPSJ), a Medicaid managed care plan, began covering teleder-
matology services in April 2012. The study aims were to as-
sess whether the introduction of teledermatology increased
the number of Medicaid enrollees who received dermatology
care and the characteristics of patients who were referred to
teledermatology vs in-person dermatology care.
Methods
Setting
Health Plan of San Joaquin is a Medicaid managed care plan
with 289 356 enrollees as of December 31, 2014. This study de-
scribes HPSJ’
s experience with teledermatology from April 1,
2012, through December 31, 2014. During the study period,
HPSJexperiencedconsiderablegrowth(126%)inenrollees.This
growth was fueled by geographic expansion into neighboring
Stanislaus County and Medicaid expansion after the imple-
mentation of the Affordable Care Act.5 This study was ap-
proved by the institutional review board of the RAND Corpo-
ration,whowaivedtheneedforinformedconsentforthisstudy
of deidentified HPSJ health claims data.
Teledermatology Model
In April 2012, HPSJ began covering teledermatology services
delivered by Direct Dermatology. The teledermatology model
incorporated consultative and direct care elements. Some of
the primary care physicians who referred patients to teleder-
matology provided background on and obtained digital im-
ages of the patient’
s skin problems and then uploaded the nec-
essary information to a secure website. They received a
consultation report within 2 days. However, over time, most
primary care practices that referred patients to teledermatol-
ogy used a more direct care model. Patients with skin prob-
lemswerereferredbytheirphysicianto2brickandmortarclin-
ics to have photographs taken and to be interviewed by a
teledermatology nurse. The remote dermatologist then re-
viewed the history and images, and the diagnosis and treat-
mentwasrelayedtothepatientandreferringprimarycarephy-
sician.Teledermatologynursesalsocalledthepatienttoreview
the diagnosis and treatment plan. If necessary, an in-person
follow-up visit was scheduled at the clinic, where a teleder-
matologist was regularly onsite. Most of these follow-up
appointments were to perform a biopsy or to address more
complex cases. As such, the introduction of the teledermatol-
ogy intervention in this population increased virtual and in-
person access to dermatologists. When describing visit pat-
terns, both types of visits provided by the teledermatology
vendor were labeled as teledermatology, because they were
delivered as part of a single, cohesive intervention.
Data Source
Health Plan of San Joaquin provided deidentified health plan
claims data and enrollment information for all enrollees with
at least 1 day of enrollment from July 1, 2011, through Decem-
ber 31, 2014. Data provided included enrollee sex, age, zip code
of residence, assigned primary care physician or practice, en-
rollment period, race/ethnicity, and use of health care
services (eg, site of care, date of service, and diagnoses).
Key Points
Question What is the effect of teledermatology on access to
dermatology care at the population level?
Findings In an analysis of claims data from a large California
Medicaid managed care plan that included 382 801 patients,
primary care practices that engaged in teledermatology had a 64%
increase in the fraction of patients visiting a dermatologist (vs 21%
in other practices). Compared with in-person dermatology,
teledermatology served more patients younger than 17 years,
men, and nonwhite patients.
Meaning Teledermatology can significantly increase access to
dermatology care.

Study Population
The 9-month period from July 1, 2011, to March 31, 2012, con-
stituted the preteledermatology period. When describing visit
patternsafterteledermatologywasoffered,allenrolleesinHPSJ
from April 1, 2012, through December 31, 2014 (n = 382 801),
were included. In subanalyses, the sample was restricted to
those continuously enrolled from July 1, 2011, through De-
cember 31, 2014 (continuous enrollment defined as least 5 of
6 months in 2011 and 11 of 12 months in 2012, 2013, and 2014;
57 113 patients [14.9% of the entire population]) and those
newlyenrolledin2014(enrolledfor≥1dayin2014withnoprior
enrollment; 108 480 patients [28.3%]). All enrollees were in-
cluded in our primary analysis because the continuously en-
rolled population (14.9%) is less likely to be generalizable
owing to significant instability in Medicaid plans; however, for
the primary analysis we conducted a sensitivity analysis
limited to the continuously enrolled.9
Identifying Practices With Higher Rates
of Teledermatology Use
We found a large amount of variation across practices in the
use of teledermatology. Anecdotally the variation was driven
by the primary care physician’
s comfort and knowledge of the
model as well as availability of in-person dermatology care (ie,
within their multispecialty group or geographically close by).
The following 2 categories of enrollees were developed:
those affiliated with practices that used teledermatology (user
practices) and those affiliated with practices that did not (non-
user practices). User practices were defined as those with pa-
tients who had more than 20 teledermatology visits during the
intervention period. These practices represented 12.3% of all
in-networkprimarycarepracticeswhoweretheprimaryhealth
care providers for 79.1% of all enrollees.
Health Plan of San Joaquin provided each enrollee’
s cho-
sen or designated primary care practice by month. Enrollees
were assigned to a practice (and by extension to user or non-
user practice categories) using the following steps. (1) If any
single primary care practice accounted for most of the total
enrolled days, the enrollee was assigned to that practice
(74.3% of all enrollees). (2) If no single practice accounted for
most of the days, but most days were affiliated with a set
of user practices or nonuser practices, the enrollee was
assigned to the user or nonuser practice cohort, respectively
(8.8% of all enrollees). (3) Remaining enrollees (16.9%)
remained unassigned and were excluded from the analyses
comparing the use of health care services between user and
nonuser practices.
Measuring and Describing Dermatology Visits
All visits to in-person dermatologists (primary or secondary
specialty of dermatology) and any type of visit to the teleder-
matologyprovider(whichwereflaggedbyHPSJinclaims)were
identified. The teledermatology provider also had some in-
person visits that were identified based on billing codes.
We compared the leading dermatologic conditions treated
by teledermatology, in-person dermatologists, and primary
care practices (primary specialty of family medicine, family
practice, general practice, internal medicine, or pediatrics). All
dermatology visits were categorized by the 3-digit code from
the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision; as
such, 1 visit could contribute more than 1 diagnosis. The
number of comorbid conditions was calculated using the
Charlson Comorbidity Index.10
Data Analysis
Data were analyzed from March 1 to October 15, 2015. Demo-
graphic, socioeconomic, comorbidity, and use of health care
service variables were compared across enrollees who re-
ceived care from teledermatology and in-person dermatolo-
gists using χ2 tests and unpaired t tests. Comorbidities were
identified using data from July 1, 2011, to December 31, 2012;
thus, our analyses using comorbidities were limited to a sub-
set of the enrollee population with data from this earlier pe-
riod. The main outcomes were (1) the percentage of enrollees
with at least 1 visit to an in-person dermatologist or teleder-
matology and (2) total number of visits with in-person
dermatologists or teledermatology per 1000 enrollees.
The periods before teledermatology (July 1, 2011, to March
31, 2012) and after teledermatology (July 1, 2013, to March 31,
2014) were defined to assess intervention effects. These pe-
riods were chosen to compare use of health care services in a
similar 9-month period because seasonal differences in
dermatology use could exist.
We calculated the percentage of change from before to
after the entry of teledermatology for the primary outcomes
by comparing enrollees affiliated with user vs nonuser prac-
tices and comparing the continuously and the newly
enrolled patients. For the first outcome (percentage of
enrollees with ≥1 visit to a dermatologist), an adjusted figure
is presented that controls for patient demographics (age, sex,
and race/ethnicity) and estimates the probability of at least 1
visit in a period, if the individual was enrolled for the full 9
months of the period before teledermatology or the period
after teledermatology. We needed to account for time
enrolled because in any given 9-month period, most of the
enrollees had noncontinuous enrollment that affects the
probability that they will visit a dermatologist. For this
adjustment, the log odds of at least 1 visit, controlling for
time enrolled and demographic characteristics, was mod-
eled. The model also included an indicator for teledermatol-
ogy user practices, an indicator equal to 1 for the period after
the teledermatology coverage change, and their interaction.
The marginal estimated probability of at least 1 visit from the
mean observed demographic distributions in the full sample
for each analysis, while assuming that each enrollee had the
full 9 months of enrollment, is presented. For the second
outcome (visit rate), we modeled the number of visits in
each period for user and nonuser practices, controlling for
enrollee demographics and length of time enrolled. The esti-
mated marginal mean number of visits, scaled to visits per
1000 individuals during the 9-month study period, was
reported. To accommodate the large number of zeros and
greater-than-Poisson variances observed in the data, a zero-
inflated negative binomial model was used with cluster-
adjusted standard errors to account the potential for 2 obser-
vations (1 in the period before teledermatology and 1 in the

ment effect was assessed by comparing the marginal means
of the periods before and after teledermatology in the user
vs nonuser practices.
We also compared leading diagnoses (defined as diagno-
ses that account for >5% of all skin condition visits to ≥1 of the
settings)managedbyteledermatology,in-personvisitstoader-
matologist’
s office, and visits to primary care physician of-
fices using χ2 tests. In this analysis, the health care visit was
the unit of analysis, and therefore a single enrollee could con-
tribute more than 1 visit, and individual visits could contrib-
ute more than 1 diagnosis.
Results
Of the 382 801 patients enrolled for at least 1 day from April 1,
2012, to December 31, 2014, 8614 (2.2%) had 1 or more visits
with a dermatologist. During the study period, 7287 teleder-
matology visits occurred across 4515 patients (mean of 1.6 vis-
its per patient) and 27 287 in-person dermatology visits across
4522 patients (mean of 5.4 visits per patient). Teledermatol-
ogy accounted for 21.0% of all visits with dermatologists and
served 48.5% of patients who interacted with a dermatolo-
gist. Among teledermatology visits, 80.2% were store and for-
ward visits, and 19.8% were in-person follow-up visits with
teledermatologists.
The number of dermatology visits per 1000 enrollees
(visit rate) increased from 0.50 to 1.24 from the third quar-
ter of 2011 to the first quarter of 2014, after which it fell to
0.91 in the fourth quarter of 2014 (Figure). In 2014, a rapid
influx of new enrollees occurred owing to the Affordable
Care Act. Compared with in-person dermatology visits,
teledermatology served more patients younger than 17 years
(2600 of 4427 [58.7%] vs 1404 of 4187 [33.5%]; P < .001),
male patients (1849 of 4427 [41.8%] vs 1526 of 4187 [36.4%];
P < .001), nonwhite patients (2779 of 4188 [66.4%] vs 1844
of 3478 [53.0%]; P < .001), and individuals without comor-
bid conditions (1795 of 2464 [72.8%] vs 1978 of 3024
[65.4%]; P < .001) (Table 1).
In unadjusted models, the percentage of enrollees with 1
or more visits to a dermatologist (including in-person and
teledermatology visits) increased from 0.9% to 1.3% among
user practices from the period before teledermatology to the
period after. The number of visits per 1000 enrollees
increased from 31.29 to 42.73.
When adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, and time
enrolled from the period before teledermatology to the
period after, the percentage of enrollees with 1 or more vis-
its with a dermatologist (including in-person and teleder-
matology visits) increased from 1.2% to 1.9% among user
practices and from 1.2% to 1.5% among nonuser practices.
The difference in the growth rate between user and nonuser
practices (63.8% vs 20.5%; P < .001) was statistically signifi-
cant. In addition, the number of visits per 1000 enrollees
increased from 40.55 to 66.72 among user practices and

correspond to large increases in the enrollee population at the beginning of
each calendar year.

from 37.09 to 59.38 among nonuser practices. The differ-
ence in the growth rate comparing user and nonuser prac-
tices (64.6% vs 60.1%; P < .001) was smaller but also statis-
tically significant (Table 2).
We compared the use of dermatology in 2014 among the
newly enrolled and continuously enrolled patients for the en-
tire study period. Fewer of the newly enrolled patients had 1
or more visits with a dermatologist compared with the con-
tinuously enrolled patients (2.2% vs 3.0%). They also had a
lower visit rate, with 45.50 vs 112.83 visits per 1000 enroll-
ees. Among the newly enrolled patients, a larger proportion
of overall visits with dermatologists were via teledermatol-
ogy (43.0% vs 17.5%) compared with the continuously
enrolled patients (Table 3).
The leading 2 categories of diagnoses from telederma-
tology visits were viral skin lesions and acne, which
together accounted for 3405 of 7287 visits (46.7%). In con-
trast, the leading 2 categories of diagnoses for in-person
dermatology visits were acne and neoplasms of uncertain
behavior, which together accounted for 10 062 of 27 347
visits (36.8%) (Table 4).
Our sensitivity analysis limited the before-and-after
comparison of the use of dermatology services to the continu-
ously enrolled patients who were assigned to a primary care
practice (45 113 [11.8%]). In adjusted models, user practices ex-
perienced greater growth than nonuser practices in the per-
centage of enrollees with 1 or more visits with dermatologists
(93.2% growth rate vs 59.9%; P = .07). However, nonuser prac-
tices had a slightly higher growth rate in visits per 1000
enrollees (109.3% vs 103.1%; P = .09), which was fueled by
greater use of in-person dermatologists by nonuser practices
(eAppendix in the Supplement).

Discussion
Results indicate that the introduction of teledermatology
achieved the aim of increasing access to dermatologists in a
large Medicaid managed care plan. Patients among primary
carepracticesthatengagedinteledermatologyweremorelikely
to have 1 or more visits with dermatologists, and the rate of
visits with dermatologists also increased. After it was intro-
duced, teledermatology served half of all enrollees who
received any dermatology care. Among new enrollees, teleder-
matology served three-fourths of patients with any dermatol-
ogy care in 2014.
Several types of patients were more likely to be referred
to teledermatology. Teledermatology generally served a
healthier, younger population with more targeted, poten-
tially less severe skin conditions. Although some common di-
agnoses occurred at in-person and telederamatology visits (eg,
acne), in-person dermatology visits had higher rates of use for
neoplasms and psoriasis and greater variation in diagnoses.
These patterns suggest that in-person dermatologists served
many of the patients in greatest need, but teledermatology ex-
panded access to a new group of enrollees with different de-
mographics and different needs. Teledermatology also played
an important role for the newly insured and may be a particu-
larly attractive option for those having difficulty establishing
a relationship with an in-person dermatologist. Many newly
insured patients have unmet health care needs that existing
health care professionals in a community could have diffi-
culty meeting in the near term. The dermatology visit rate
among the newly insured was less than half that of the con-
tinuously enrolled. This difference is a bit surprising given that
other work has noted that sicker patients (who have deferred
use of services on enrollment) typically enroll first. If no bar-
rierswereassociatedwithobtainingdermatologiccareasanew
patient, one would expect to see higher rates of use among
newly insured patients.11
The health plan’
s primary goal in covering teledermatol-
ogy was to increase use of dermatologic care. In the future, the
aim of teledermatology interventions may be to substitute for
in-person visits, thereby reducing costs (eg, travel time and
costs and lost productivity for patients) from a societal
perspective.2,12
While teledermatology was being implemented in HPSJ,
a substantial increase occurred in the use of in-person der-
matologists. Sensitivity analyses focused exclusively on the
continuously enrolled patients revealed that nonuser prac-
tices had a greater increase in dermatology visits per capita
than user practices. Why this is the case is unclear. The con-
tinuously enrolled patients in this particular analysis repre-
sented 11.8% of all enrollees, and they are very different
than the general Medicaid population. In general, nonuser
practices may not have referred their patients to telederma-
tology because they observed fewer barriers to dermato-

logic care and/or because of new dermatologists in their
system, and this possibility is reflected in the observed
increase of in-person dermatology visits.
Several limitations deserve consideration. First, assign-
ments (eg, user practices, assignment to a primary care prac-
tice) not directly observable had to be made to categorize and
analyze the data. Second, this study only describes the expe-
riences of HPSJ with teledermatology services in California,
and thus how generalizable our results are to other teleder-
matologyinterventionsinotherregionswithotherhealthplans
remainsunclear.Third,HPSJexperiencedagreatdealofgrowth
during the study period and as a result, enrollees had vari-
able exposure to teledermatology, and enrollees who joined
owing to the Affordable Care Act’
s Medicaid expansion are
likely different from a demographic perspective. Fourth, HPSJ
could only provide 9 months of preteledermatology data to de-
scribe baseline trends. Fifth, the study lacks an ideal control
group because all practices were eligible to use teledermatol-
ogy, but only certain practices took advantage of the service.
Finally, although teledermatology appears to have increased
access to dermatologists, whether the use of these services ob-
served after the introduction of teledermatology suggests ad-
equate access is unclear because no national standard exists
on appropriate dermatology use.
The clinical model implemented by this teledermatology
provider may have important lessons for the field of tele-
health. The model evolved from a purely virtual model to
one that incorporates brick-and-mortar clinics to accommo-
date in-person evaluations. This novel model is more
resource intensive than an exclusively virtual model, but it
was successful in expanding access. Future research should
assess the quality of services provided and the satisfaction
of patients and referring health care professionals with this
model of teledermatology compared with others. The results
show that this particular model, and teledermatology in gen-
eral, have promise for other Medicaid plans that struggle
with meeting the specialty care needs of traditional as well
as new enrollees.
Conclusions
The offering of teledermatology appears to improve access to
care among Medicaid enrollees and played an especially
important role for newly enrolled patients. This particular
model, and teledermatology in general, offer promise for other
Medicaid plans that struggle with meeting the specialty care
needs of traditional as well as new enrollees.
