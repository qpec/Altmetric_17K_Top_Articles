Abstract
Background: Adolescents are vulnerable to risky behaviours that are likely to co-occur. We examined whether
happiness, awareness of alcohol- or smoking-related harm or the size of friendship networks would be longitudinally
associated with young people’s risky behaviours.
Methods: We used available cases (N=1,729) from adolescents aged between 10 and 15 who participated in waves 2
and 3 of the UK Longitudinal Household Study that has annually collected population representative data from 40,000
UK households. The outcome variable was patterns of cigarette and alcohol use among adolescents (1= persistent
non-use; 2= ex-use; 3= initiation; 4= persistent use) that we derived by tabulating current alcohol or cigarette use at
waves 2 and 3. Explanatory variables were scores on participants’ perception of overall happiness, awareness of harm
due to alcohol and cigarette use, and supportive friendship network size, collected at wave 2. Covariates were
participants’ sex, age, base level of self-reported health status, reported religious affiliation, and household social
position. All estimates were corrected for the complex survey design and non-response. Multinomial logistic regression
was used to test assumed associations by taking persistent cigarette and alcohol use as the reference category.
Results: Findings showed higher happiness scores were longitudinally associated with adolescents’ persistent
non-use (RRR=1.06, 95% CI=1.01-1.13). Awareness of alcohol or cigarette use-related harm was longitudinally
associated with persistent non-use (RRR=1.24, 95% CI 1.15-1.35) as well as initiation of alcohol or cigarette use
(RRR=1.21, 95% CI=1.11-1.32).
Conclusion: Joint interventions to promote happiness and harm awareness could help young adolescents
from engaging with drinking alcohol or smoking cigarettes.

Background
Adolescence is a developmental stage, known to be vul-
nerable to engaging with risky health behaviours, includ-
ing drinking alcohol [1] or smoking cigarettes [2]. A
systematic review on alcohol harm showed a decreasing
trend in alcohol consumption among adolescents in the
UK [3]; a similar trend was also observed in cigarette use
among school-aged children in England [4]. However, the
profile of alcohol and cigarette use among older children
showed a different picture, with a higher prevalence of al-
cohol and cigarette use [4] and an increased likelihood of
physical harm occasioned by their risky alcohol use [3],
compared to younger children. Drinking and smoking be-
haviours were likely to co-occur in the early stage of ado-
lescence and to persist [5], increasing the risk of heavier
alcohol consumption [6]. These findings warrants our at-
tention in investigating potentially preventive factors for
adolescent alcohol and cigarettes use.
Awareness of alcohol- and cigarette-related harm
Recent work using data from the UK Millennium Cohort
Study showed that awareness of harms due to alcohol was
associated with a reduced risk of drinking among 11 year
olds [7, 8]. School policies that provide knowledge about
the harms of cigarette use were effective in altering school

 children’s perceptions [9]. Moreover, school-based inter-
ventions on alcohol education and counselling were found
to be effective in preventing school-aged children from
engaging in risky alcohol use [10]. Therefore, estimating
the potentially protective effect of harm awareness on al-
cohol or cigarette use in a contemporary UK setting could
help inform harm reduction strategies.
Other possible protective factors
Recent findings suggest potential influences for adoles-
cents’ psychosocial factors in relation to their alcohol or
cigarette use. Hostility [11] and emotional distress [12]
were identified characteristics of school-aged (between
10 and 19) smokers, while emotional distress preceded
or was concurrent with the patterns of alcohol and to-
bacco use among adolescents, aged between 15 and 18
[13]. Social isolation was another identified characteristic
linking to adolescent cigarette use [14].
Booker and others [12] showed that self-reported feel-
ings of happiness had an independent, cross-sectional
association with a range of health-related behaviours
such as drinking alcohol, smoking cigarettes, exercise,
and diet. However, prospective findings are sparse here
and this link needs to be examined further to establish a
temporal order by examining whether happiness could
protect children from using alcohol or cigarettes. Religi-
osity has been linked with adolescents’ health outcomes
[15]. Findings linking between religiosity and substance
use were inconsistent, given the multidimensional nature
of the concept [16]. Adolescents’ religious affiliation was
linked with alcohol use [16] and had shown to be pre-
dictive of their lifestyle [17]. These findings suggest that
adjustment of religious affiliation is required to examine
the independent association between adolescents’ happi-
ness and alcohol and cigarette use.
Despite peer drinking being a large driving factor for al-
cohol use among adolescents [1, 7, 8], it may be that jointly
with happiness, larger supportive friendship networks could
have the effect of distancing children from engaging with
the use of alcohol or cigarettes. The aim of this study is to
examine the roles of three possible protective factors (harm
awareness, happiness, and supportive networks) in relation
to patterns of alcohol or cigarette use among young people
in the UK, based on a population-based household study.
In this study, we specifically address the hypothesis, antici-
pating an independent longitudinal associations between
these protective factors and non-initiation of alcohol and
cigarette use among them.
Methods
Data
We used available cases (N=1,729) from young people
between aged 10 and 15 who participated in both waves
2 and 3 [18] of Understanding Society (UK Longitudinal
Household Study, UKHLS). UKHLS has collected data
representative of the population from a selected 40,000
households in the United Kingdom annually since 2009
[19]. The study invites anybody in the household aged
16 and over to participate in the main survey. Separately,
young people aged between 10 and 15 in the same
household are asked to take part in the study by com-
pleting a short questionnaire. The field work was con-
ducted during January 2010 and March 2012 for the
wave 2 and during January 2011 and July 2013 for the
wave 3. Further details regarding the sampling of
UKHLS is found in the work by Burton et al. [19] Paren-
tal consent was obtained to collect data from eligible
young people in the selected households [20]. Each child
completed a paper and pencil questionnaire which was
expected to take 10 minutes to complete, without par-
ents being present [12]. Survey weights have been de-
rived to correct estimates to reflect representativeness of
the UK population, accounting for oversampling of mi-
nority groups and response patterns [21].
We were able to match 3,019 longitudinal cases be-
tween waves 2 (n=5,020) and 3 (n=4,427); Out of these
cases, we excluded a further 1,290 cases that did not
have information on any of the study variables; the final
sample size for this study is 1729.
Ethical consideration
UKHLS data are publicly available via the UK data arch-
ive (http://ukdataservice.ac.uk/) for academic use. All
personal information that may link the data with the
participants were removed already and therefore are ex-
empt from obtaining ethical approval to use the data.
Outcome
Alcohol and cigarette use status was approximated via par-
ticipants’ response to their alcohol and cigarette use asked
about in both waves 2 and 3. We coded the positive re-
sponse to the use of either substance as ‘use’
, as opposed to
not using either of the substances (i.e. ‘non-use’). We com-
bined responses at both waves and created four use cat-
egories as: persistent non-use (=not using alcohol or
cigarettes at both waves), ex-use (=used alcohol or ciga-
rettes at wave 2, but non-use at wave 3), initiation (=non-
use at wave 2, but started using alcohol or cigarettes at
wave 3), and persistent use (=used alcohol or cigarettes at
both waves).
Explanatory variables
Happiness
In UKHLS young participants’ degree of happiness was
assessed in 6 areas of their lives: their school performance,
looks, family, friends, school, and life in general. The partic-
ipants were asked to identify their perceived happiness
from 7 levels of smiling pictured face (i.e. emoticons), 1

 being very happy and 7 being unhappy. We reversed each
code for the high score to correspond with greater happi-
ness. We adopted the approach of previous studies [12, 22]
of treating these scales as an index by adding the sum of
each scale. Cronbach’s alpha for this index was 0.75. It did
not have substantial difference with age, ranging between
0.69 and 0.76 for ages 10 and 11, while the values for ages
12 to 15 fell within the range.
Harm awareness
We used questions concerning participants’ awareness
about the harm caused by various types of alcohol or
cigarette use that were administered at wave 2. They were
asked to choose a response from no risk (=1) to great risk
(=4) on occasional smoking, daily smoking, light daily
drinking, heavy daily drinking, and heavy weekend drink-
ing. Similarly to our approach towards the happiness vari-
able, we applied principal component analysis to assess
whether these items would be integrated under one di-
mension. The results of principal component analysis con-
firmed the unidimensionality of psychometric property on
these items and we treated them as an index by summing
up each item. Cronbach’s alpha of this index was 0.74
(range 0.61-0.81 for ages 14+ and 10 respectively).
Size of supportive friendship networks
At the wave 2 survey, participants were asked to identify
the number of their friends with whom they could emo-
tionally confide. The reported numbers ranged from 0 to
97 and were highly skewed from 7 onwards. In our study
sample, nobody reported an absence of friends. We com-
bined the upper tail of the distribution to create a 6+
category.
Covariates
We included sex of the participants, age, religious affilia-
tions, health status, and household social position in the
model to account for those effects on the associations
between the explanatory variables and outcome.
Past studies showed diminishing effects of parental in-
fluence on young people during the transitional develop-
mental stage to enter adulthood [23, 24]. Our primary
focus is to examine the roles of explanatory variables, and
information about peer drinking is not available at the
wave 2 survey. Therefore we did not include parental or
peer alcohol use in the model to minimise added com-
plexity to the model. Neither did we include participants’
residential characteristics (=urban or rural) because this
factor was not significantly associated with the outcome in
our preliminary analysis.
We used participants’ age at wave 2 in the model. Partic-
ipants’ religious affiliations were only asked at wave 3. We
treated this item as a binary response, 1 having religious
affiliation and 0 being no religious affiliations. Health
status of the participants was assessed by their response to
a general health question, scored as 1 excellent to 5 poor.
We coded household social position was derived by taking
the highest occupational position of the parents that was
reported by parents and indicated by the National Statis-
tics Socio-economic classification (NS-SEC).
Analyses
We used multinomial logistic regression to assess the pres-
ence of longitudinal associations between three explanatory
variables (harm awareness, happiness, and size of friendship
networks) and the outcome (use categories), taking persist-
ent use as a reference category to address our study aim, es-
pecially the relationships between protective factors with
the non-initiation of drinking and smoking.
Stata v13 SE [25] was used for the analysis. We used the
‘svy’ command to account for the complex data structure
as well as applying the survey weights to the estimates.
Variance was scaled to a single sampling unit to deal with
the strata in the data by using the ‘single unit’ option in
the ‘svy’ command.
Results
Table 1 shows descriptive characteristics of the partici-
pants by their patterns of alcohol and cigarette use.
Close to 70% (n=1190, weighted) of the participants
were in the group of persistent non-use, while there
were similar proportions (12.7%) in the groups of initi-
ation (n=218.2, weighted) and persistent use (n=218,
weighted). The group of ex-use was the smallest of all
(n=92.91, weighted).
As a whole, the number of participants was similar be-
tween boys (n=849.2, weighted) and girls (n= 869.6,
weighted). Comparing the distribution of sex according
to the use groups, more girls were in the groups of per-
sistent use and non-use, while more boys were found in
the groups of ex-use and initiation. Nevertheless, it was
not statistically significant.
More young people aged between 10 and 12 were in
the persistent non-use group, while participants aged 13
through 14 and over were in the persistent user and ini-
tiation groups, and these differences were statistically
significant. Many of the young people, apart from those
in the group of persistent use, rated their health as very
good or excellent. Moreover, around half of the young
people, apart from those in the group of ex-use, were
from an affluent social background. However, the distri-
bution of self-reported health or household position
across use groups was not statistically significant.
In descriptive findings, young people in the persistent
non-use group showed the highest mean score on harm
awareness or happiness compared to the rest of the
groups (Table 1). In regard to the size of friendship net-
works, most of the young people had more than 6

results of multinomial logistic regression confirmed that

happiness score was equated with the relative risk ratio
of 1.06 being in the group of persistent non-use relative
to persistent use.
In addition, awareness of alcohol or cigarette use-
related harm was positively and longitudinally associated
with persistent non-use as well as with initiation. In the
fully adjusted model, the relative risk ratios were similar
between persistent non-use (RRR=1.24, 95% CI 1.14-
1.35) and initiation (RRR=1.21, 95% CI=1.11-1.32) in ref-
erence to persistent use.
The size of friendship networks was not significantly as-
sociated with any of the use groups, and none of the ex-
planatory variables were longitudinally associated with ex-
use. However, Wald tests confirmed all of the outcome
categories were significantly different from each other at

Discussion
We found that adolescents’ positive affect, indicated by
happiness and awareness of alcohol or cigarette use-
related harm had longitudinal associations with persistent
non-use as we hypothesised. Our finding offers extended
support to the study by Booker et al. [12], reporting a
cross-sectional association between these factors.
We also found that adolescents’ awareness of harm
resulting from alcohol and cigarette use was significantly
related to both initiation and persistent non-use. Prior
work has shown that alcohol harm awareness is linked to
a reduced chance of drinking in early adolescence [7, 8].
Adolescents’ expectations of gaining positive experiences
with enhanced socialisation and reduced anxiety through
alcohol use (i.e. positive expectancies) were found to be
associated with their alcohol use [1, 7, 8]. Information
about adolescents’ expectancies about alcohol or cigarettes
was not collected in the UKHLS survey; however, it is pos-
sible that their higher expectations from drinking alcohol
or smoking cigarettes may have overcome their awareness
of harm from using those substances.
We expected to find protective associations between
the size of adolescents’ supportive friendship networks
and the patterns of their use. Huang et al. [26] found
that the number of close friends obtained via social net-
work sites was not associated with alcohol use among
adolescents in the United States. However, due to data
availability we do not have detailed information about
whether the study participants’ friendship networks are
‘virtual’. Nor do we have data about peer drinking. Fur-
ther studies exploring peer usage of alcohol and ciga-
rettes within the friendship networks, and changes in
friendship networks are needed to examine how adoles-
cents’ alcohol and cigarette use takes place within the
context of friendship networks.
Strengths and limitations
In our study, we were able to statistically control covari-
ates and all reported longitudinal associations were
independent from participants’ sex, age, religious affili-
ation, health status, and household social position. As sug-
gested by Rowland et al. [27], we considered the effect of
the density of alcohol retail shops on the study’s outcome.
In our preliminary analysis, geographical location of ado-
lescents (urban or rural) was not significantly associated
with the outcome. All estimates in our analyses took ac-
count of the complexity of the UKHLS sampling frame-
work to reflect representativeness of the UK population.
We did not find that any explanatory variables were as-
sociated with stopping drinking or smoking. It is possible
that recanting on alcohol or smoking may have affected
the grouping of the outcome category even though smok-
ing status obtained from male participants or those who
started smoking at a young age has been shown elsewhere
to be less prone to recall bias [28]. We only used data
from waves 2 and 3 of the survey; using subsequent
sweeps could have ascertained the validity of each status,
especially ex-use. However, this would have led to reduced
statistical power, due to attrition and exclusion of ineli-
gible cases. In our study, we found statistical significance
between all use groups, suggesting that each status is dis-
tinctively different from all the others.
Concerning the patterns of alcohol and cigarette use, at-
tendance to church service or involvement in church ac-
tivities (i.e. public religiosity) was found to be associated
with adolescents’ cessation of cigarette use [29]. We only
had information about participants’ religious affiliation,
and it was treated as a covariate to ascertain independent
associations between explanatory factors and patterns of
adolescents’ alcohol and cigarette use. Social aspects of al-
cohol and cigarette use could have been explored if we
had a theoretically validated measurement for religiosity.
In our study adolescents’ happiness and greater aware-
ness of harm related to alcohol or cigarette use appeared
to be jointly associated with their persistence in not en-
gaging with drinking alcohol or smoking cigarettes. How-
ever, all information were collected via a self-reported
questionnaire. Therefore significant findings should be
interpreted with caution.
In UKHLS, adolescents who turn 16 at the data collec-
tion of each sweep are included in the main survey
which contains detailed information about health-related
behaviours; longitudinal analysis from early adolescence
to entering into adulthood would look further at this
longitudinal association as well as adding to our under-
standing of the formation and progression of alcohol
and cigarette use in this population.
Conclusions
In summary, adolescents’ feelings of happiness and harm
awareness appear to be jointly important for their persist-
ent non-engagement with drinking alcohol or smoking
cigarettes. Preventive interventions for alcohol or cigarette
