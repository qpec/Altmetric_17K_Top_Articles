Summary
Background Despite the heightened risk of serious infl
 uenza during infancy, vaccination is not recommended in infants 
younger than 6 months. We aimed to assess the safety, immunogenicity, and effi
  cacy of maternal immunisation with 
trivalent inactivated infl
 uenza vaccine for protection of infants against a fi
 rst episode of laboratory-confi
 rmed infl
 uenza.
Methods We did this prospective, active-controlled, observer-blind, randomised phase 4 trial at six referral centres and 
community health centres in Bamako, Mali. Third-trimester pregnant women (≥28 weeks’ gestation) were randomly 
assigned (1:1), via a computer-generated, centre-specifi
 c list with alternate block sizes of six or 12, to receive either 
trivalent inactivated infl
 uenza vaccine or quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine. Study personnel administering vaccines 
were not masked to treatment allocation, but allocation was concealed from clinicians, laboratory personnel, and 
participants. Infants were visited weekly until age 6 months to detect infl
 uenza-like illness; laboratory-confi
 rmed 
infl
 uenza diagnosed with RT-PCR. We assessed two coprimary objectives: vaccine effi
  cacy against laboratory-confi
 rmed 
infl
 uenza in infants born to women immunised any time prepartum (intention-to-treat population), and vaccine effi
  cacy 
in infants born to women immunised at least 14 days prepartum (per-protocol population). The primary outcome was 
the occurrence of a fi
 rst case of laboratory-confi
 rmed infl
 uenza by age 6 months. This trial is registered with 
ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01430689.
Findings We did this trial from Sept 12, 2011, to Jan 28, 2014. Between Sept 12, 2011, and April 18, 2013, we randomly 
assigned 4193 women to receive trivalent inactivated infl
 uenza vaccine (n=2108) or quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine 
(n=2085). There were 4105 livebirths; 1797 (87%) of 2064 infants in the trivalent inactivated infl
 uenza vaccine group and 
1793 (88%) of 2041 infants in the quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine group were followed up until age 6 months. We 
recorded 5279 infl
 uenza-like illness episodes in 2789 (68%) infants, of which 131 (2%) episodes were laboratory-
confi
 rmed infl
 uenza. 129 (98%) cases of laboratory-confi
 rmed infl
 uenza were fi
 rst episodes (n=77 in the quadrivalent 
meningococcal vaccine group vs n=52 in the trivalent inactivated infl
 uenza vaccine group). In the intention-to-treat 
population, overall infant vaccine effi
  cacy was 33·1% (95% CI 3·7–53·9); in the per-protocol population, vaccine effi
  cacy 
was 37·3% (7·6–57·8). Vaccine effi
  cacy remained robust during the fi
 rst 4 months of follow-up (67·9% [95% CI 
35·1–85·3] by intention to treat and 70·2% [35·7–87·6] by per protocol), before diminishing during the fi
 fth month 
(57·3% [30·6–74·4] and 60·7 [33·8–77·5], respectively). Adverse event rates in women and infants were similar among 
groups. Pain at the injection site was more common in women given quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine than in those 
given trivalent inactivated infl
 uenza vaccine (n=253 vs n=132; p<0·0001), although 354 [92%] reactions were mild. 
Obstetrical and non-obstetrical serious adverse events were reported in 60 (3%) women in the quadrivalent 
meningococcal vaccine group and 61 (3%) women in the trivalent inactivated infl
 uenza vaccine group. Presumed 
neonatal infection was more common in infants in the trivalent inactivated infl
 uenza vaccine group than in those in the 
quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine group (n=60 vs n=37; p=0·02). No serious adverse events were related to vaccination.
Interpretation Vaccination of pregnant women with trivalent inactivated infl
 uenza vaccine in Mali—a poorly resourced 
country with high infant mortality—was technically and logistically feasible and protected infants from laboratory-
confi
 rmed infl
 uenza for 4 months. With adequate fi
 nancing to procure the vaccine, implementation will parallel the 
access to antenatal care and immunisation coverage of pregnant women with tetanus toxoid.

Introduction 
Pregnant women and young infants are at increased risk 
of developing severe, complicated, and sometimes fatal 
infl
 uenza infection;1–4 however, no infl
 uenza vaccines are 
approved for infants younger than 6 months.5–7 Maternal 
immunisation against infl
 uenza is a promising strategy 
to reduce disease in pregnant women and young infants.8,9 
Trials in Bangladesh10 and South Africa11 showed 
protection against laboratory-confi
 rmed infl
 uenza in 
infants born to mothers who received trivalent inactivated 
infl
 uenza vaccine, but additional health benefi
 ts in those 
infants (eg, higher birthweight and reduced likelihood of 
being small for gestational age) have been inconsistent.11,12 
Remaining questions include more precise determination 
of the duration of protection for infants that can accrue 
from maternal immunisation,8 and the technical and 
logistical feasibility and eff
 ectiveness of implementation 
of programmes in resource-limited settings with high to 
moderate infant mortality rates.13
We aimed to address these questions in the course of a 
post-licensure clinical trial of the safety, immunogenicity, 
and effi
  cacy of maternal infl
 uenza immunisation for 
prevention of infl
 uenza in infants younger than 6 months 
in Mali, west Africa—one of the world’s least developed 
countries, with the world’s seventh highest infant 
mortality rate.14,15 Mali, nevertheless, maintains a vaunted 
Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) that includes 
immunisation of pregnant women with tetanus toxoid 
and the introduction of fi
 ve new EPI vaccines for infants 
since 2005.16–18 Introduction of additional vaccines for 
pregnant 
women, 
particularly 
trivalent 
inactivated 
infl
 uenza vaccine, the composition of which changes 
annually, would be challenging, but would make use of an 
existing eff
 ective vaccine delivery platform.
Methods
Study design and participants
We did this prospective, active-controlled, observer-blind, 
randomised phase 4 trial at six referral centres and 
community health centres in Bamako, Mali. In the year 
before starting the trial, infl
 uenza activity occurred from 
September to April, with peaks in October and February.
Third-trimester pregnant women (≥28 weeks’ gestation 
based on last menstrual period, ultrasound, or uterine 
height) presenting to participating health centres for 
prenatal care were eligible for inclusion. Participants had 
to be able to understand and comply with planned study 
procedures, provide written informed consent before 
initiation of any study procedures, and intend to reside in 
the study area until their newborn infants were 6 months 
old. Participants could not be members of a household 
that already had a woman who was participating or had 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Immunisation of pregnant women against infl
 uenza has been 
common practice in industrialised nations since their vulnerability 
to severe disease and adverse outcomes was recognised. 
Nevertheless, this practice has not been adopted by low-income 
countries with constrained resources. When we undertook this 
trial, maternal immunisation as a strategy to prevent infant 
illness and avert associated morbidity and mortality was gaining 
traction. We searched PubMed between April 17, 1996, and 
March 8, 2016, for clinical trials with the terms “maternal 
infl
 uenza vaccination” and “maternal infl
 uenza immunization”. 
Our search yielded 36 publications. Two publications were of 
randomised clinical trials done in low-income and middle-income 
countries that measured the effi
  cacy of maternal infl
 uenza 
vaccination in protection of infants. The fi
 rst trial, done in 
Bangladesh, reported 63% effi
  cacy in the reduction of 
laboratory-confi
 rmed infl
 uenza in infants aged up to 24 weeks. 
Furthermore, infants born to women who received infl
 uenza 
vaccine were less likely to be small for gestational age and had a 
higher mean birthweight than did those born to women in the 
control group. The next trial was done in South Africa and 
reported 48·8% effi
  cacy in infants aged up to 24 weeks; however, 
the other benefi
 ts to infants were not shown.
Added value of this study
Our trial represents the largest evaluation so far of maternal 
infl
 uenza vaccination as a strategy to prevent infl
 uenza in the 
youngest infants. Additionally, it is the fi
 rst such study to be 
completed in west Africa, specifi
 cally Mali, one of the poorest 
countries in the world. Demonstrating the effi
  cacy of 
maternal infl
 uenza vaccination in this setting is compelling. 
Moreover, establishing that effi
  cacy is highest in the fi
 rst 
4 months of life (67·9%) is important as the duration of 
protection conferred through maternal vaccination and 
anticipated benefi
 ts are assessed. Finally, the absence of an 
eff
 ect on the incidence of low birthweight is consistent with 
fi
 ndings shown in South Africa.
Implications of all the available evidence
Our study unequivocally demonstrates effi
  cacy of maternal 
infl
 uenza vaccination against laboratory-confi
 rmed infl
 uenza in 
infants and mothers. Moreover, there was high acceptability and 
logistical feasibility. However, our trial and that done in South Africa 
did not corroborate the previously reported benefi
 ts on neonatal 
outcomes. Moreover, because these trials were not designed to 
measure an eff
 ect on severe, deadly disease, there remains a notable 
gap when assessing the cost-eff
 ectiveness of this intervention. 
Although the success of maternal tetanus immunisation 
programmes suggests that implementation of infl
 uenza 
vaccination would also be successful, the related cost would need to 
be justifi
 ed by the gains of the benefi
 ts aff
 orded so that local policy 
makers and donors could invest their restricted funds.

participated in this study. Other exclusion criteria were a 
history of severe reactions following previous immuni-
sation with infl
 uenza or meningococcal vaccines; 
Guillain–Barré syndrome; known allergy or hyper-
sensitivity to eggs, egg proteins, latex, diphtheria toxoid, 
or any other components of trivalent inactivated 
infl
 uenza vaccine (Vaxigrip) and quadrivalent meningo-
coccal conjugate vaccine (Menactra); known chronic 
medical disorder that, in the judgment of the investigator, 
could compromise assessment of the study vaccine or 
put the participant at risk; known active infection with 
HIV, hepatitis B virus, or hepatitis C virus; complications 
with the ongoing pregnancy, including preterm labour 
(with cervical change), placental abruption, premature 
rupture of membranes, known major congenital 
anomaly, or pre-eclampsia; acute illness or an oral 
temperature greater than or equal to 37·8°C within 72 h 
of vaccination (resulted in a temporary delay of 
vaccination); receipt of any other vaccine, excluding 
tetanus toxoid, within 2 weeks (for inactivated vaccines) 
or 4 weeks (for live vaccines and meningococcal A 
conjugate vaccine) before vaccination in this study; 
receipt of immunoglobulins or any blood products 
within 30 days before administration of study vaccines; 
chronic administration of immuno 
suppressants or other 
immune-modifying drugs within 90 days before 
administration of study vaccines; or any disorder that, in 
the opinion of the investigator, might compromise the 
wellbeing of the participant or compliance with study 
procedures, or interfere with the assessment of study 
vaccines. We additionally excluded women who intended 
to travel out of the study area in the 40 days after delivery. 
Enrolment continued until the requisite number of 
laboratory-confi
 rmed infl
 uenza cases was detected in 
infants born to vaccinated women.
Approval for the research was obtained from the 
University of Maryland, Baltimore Institutional Review 
Board; the ethics committee of the Faculté de Médecine, 
Pharmacie et Odonto-Stomatologie of Mali; and the 
Ministry of Health of Mali. Community sensitisation was 
achieved through community leaders, health centre 
representatives and community members who attended 
community-wide meetings. All participants provided 
informed consent. If the participant was illiterate, 
consent was obtained in the presence of a literate witness 
after listening to the audiotaped version of the consent 
form in Bambara, the local language.
Randomisation and masking
Participants were randomly allocated (1:1), via a computer-
generated, centre-specifi
 c list with alternate block sizes of 
six or 12, to receive trivalent inactivated infl
 uenza vaccine 
(Vaxigrip, Sanofi
  Pasteur, Lyon, France) or quadrivalent 
meningococcal conjugate vaccine (Menactra, Sanofi
 
Pasteur, Lyon, France). At enrolment, consenting 
participants were assigned an identifi
 cation number, 
which at vaccination was referenced on the randomisation 
list and the allocated treatment given. The identifi
 cation 
numbers for ineligible participants or those who 
withdrew before vaccination were not reassigned.
Study personnel who administered study vaccines and 
were aware of treatment allocation had no contact with 
participants after vaccination and were instructed not to 
reveal the identity of the study vaccines either to 
participants or to personnel masked to treatment 
allocation. Although the syringes used to administer the 
vaccines were diff
 erent in appearance, participants were 
instructed to look away from the vaccinator and were 
unaware of the assigned intervention.
Procedures
Quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine, rather 
than placebo, was given to controls to provide a potential 
benefi
 t for all participants in this poor, mostly illiterate, 
vulnerable population of pregnant women. Moreover, 
that vaccine was unlikely to interfere with the primary 
outcome of the trial, yet would provide protection against 
meningococcal disease. Although disease due to 
serogroup A has largely disappeared from the region, 
other serogroups continue to cause epidemics in Mali.
The composition of trivalent inactivated infl
 uenza 
vaccine, supplied in prefi
 lled syringes, changed during the 
trial. From September, 2011, to November, 2012, 
A/California/7/2009(H1N1[pandemic]-like), 
A/Perth/16/
2009(H3N2)-like, 
and 
B/Brisbane/60/2008-like 
(2011 
northern hemisphere formulation and then 2012 southern 
hemisphere formulation) were administered. From 
December, 2012, to April, 2013, A/California/7/2009 
(H1N1[pandemic]-like), 
A/Victoria/361/2011(H3N2)-like 
strain, and B/Wisconsin/1/2010-like (2012 northern 
hemisphere formulation) were administered. Quadrivalent 
meningo 
coccal conjugate vaccine, composed of 4 μg each 
of Neisseria meningitidis serogroup A, C, Y, and W-135 
polysaccharides conjugated to diphtheria toxoid protein, 
was supplied in single-dose vials. A single 0·5 mL dose of 
trivalent inactivated infl
 uenza vaccine or quadrivalent 
meningococcal conjugate vaccine was injected into the 
deltoid muscle. Study vaccines were stored in secure, 
temperature-monitored refrigerators or cold rooms at 
2–8°C.
After vaccination, women were observed for 30 min. 
7 days after vaccination, fi
 eld personnel interviewed the 
women about any local and systemic reactions. 28 days 
after vaccination, participants were clinically evaluated. 
Additional visits to evaluate safety and immunogenicity in 
women and infants were done at delivery and when the 
infant was 3 months and 6 months old. Each evaluation 
included a physical examination and blood specimen 
collection. When available, the infant birth sample was 
cord blood; otherwise, the birth sample was collected 
within 7 days after birth. To determine gestational age at 
birth, the New Ballard Score was measured at delivery or 
within 7 days after birth.19 Serious adverse events were 
recorded throughout study participation.

Besides safety follow-up visits, from enrolment to 
when the infant reached age 6 months, fi
 eld personnel 
undertook weekly visits to detect infl
 uenza-like illness 
and severe acute respiratory infection. During each visit, 
the participating woman and infant (if already born) had 
their temperatures measured and were examined for 
infl
 uenza-like illness; women were additionally examined 
for severe acute respiratory infection. When case 
defi
 nitions for either disease were met (appendix p 5), 
nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs and a malaria 
blood smear were obtained. If infl
 uenza was detected by 
RT-PCR, the case was deemed to be laboratory-confi
 rmed 
infl
 uenza. Standard-of-care treatment was off
 ered.
Because the primary objective was to measure the 
effi
  cacy of maternal immunisation for prevention of 
laboratory-confi
 rmed infl
 uenza in their infants younger 
than 6 months, women were withdrawn from weekly 
surveillance of infl
 uenza-like illness following stillbirth, 
fetal death, infant death, or other events that precluded 
infant surveillance. Nevertheless, safety follow-up of 
women continued until 6 months after delivery. 
Appendix p 6 describes methods for sample collection, 
RT-PCR to detect infl
 uenza virus, virus subtyping, and 
haemagglutination inhibition antibody measurement.
Outcomes
We assessed two coprimary objectives: vaccine effi
  cacy in 
infants born to women vaccinated any time prepartum 
(intention-to-treat analysis), and vaccine effi
  cacy in infants 
born to women vaccinated at least 14 days prepartum (per-
protocol analysis). The primary outcome was the 
occurrence of a fi
 rst case of laboratory-confi
 rmed infl
 uenza 
by age 6 months. Secondary outcomes were the occurrence 
of a fi
 rst case of laboratory-confi
 rmed infl
 uenza in women 
(prepartum and post partum); occurrence of a fi
 rst case of 
febrile infl
 uenza-like illness by age 6 months in infants; 
occurrence of a fi
 rst case of febrile infl
 uenza-like illness in 
women (prepartum and post partum); occurrence of local 
and systemic reactogenicity after injection, related serious 
adverse events for the entire follow-up period, and all 
pregnancy complications; levels of infl
 uenza virus 
antibodies by haemagglutination inhibition before and 
4 weeks after vaccination, at delivery, and 3 and 6 months 
after delivery. Tertiary outcomes included the frequency of 
each infl
 uenza virus type circulating in the study 
population, the levels of maternally derived infl
 uenza virus 
haemagglutination inhibition antibodies present in infants 
at birth and at ages 3 and 6 months, birthweights of infants 
born at a health centre, and the occurrence of severe acute 
respiratory infection in pregnant women. Appendix p 6 
lists additional outcomes not included in the manuscript.
Statistical analysis
We calculated vaccine effi
  cacy with the formula:
where VE is vaccine effi
  cacy, h is the ratio of follow-up 
time up to age 6 months in infants born to recipients of 
quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine to the follow-up 
time in infants born to recipients of trivalent inactivated 
infl
 uenza vaccine, and P is the proportion of all cases of 
laboratory-confi
 rmed infl
 uenza occurring by age 
6 months in infants whose mothers received trivalent 
inactivated infl
 uenza vaccine. This calculation is 
equivalent to estimating vaccine effi
  cacy as 1–R, where 
R is the ratio of laboratory-confi
 rmed infl
 uenza incidence 
rates. We used the ratio of incidence rates, rather than 
the ratio of proportions of participants who had 
laboratory-confi
 rmed infl
 uenza to account for infants 
lost to follow-up before age 6 months. We estimated 
vaccine effi
  cacy in both the intention-to-treat and the per-
protocol populations. Only infants’ fi
 rst laboratory-
confi
 rmed infl
 uenza episodes were counted. Follow-up 
time was time from birth to fi
 rst case of laboratory-
confi
 rmed infl
 uenza, infants reaching age 6 months, or 
exiting the study. We calculated vaccine effi
  cacy for each 
month of age (0–5 months) and cumulative to each 
month of age.
For safety outcomes, we used Fisher’s exact tests and 
Student’s t tests to compare the proportion of participants 
who had each event per vaccine group. We did time-to-
event analysis using Cox proportional hazards regression 
with laboratory-confi
 rmed infl
 uenza as the outcome to 
establish whether year of vaccination or timing of 
vaccination relative to delivery had an eff
 ect on effi
  cacy. 
Birthweight analysis was limited to weights that were 
either 500 g and more or 5000 g and less. We compared 
birthweight between vaccine groups both overall and 
within infl
 uenza seasons, defi
 ned as months with higher-
than-average rates of laboratory-confi
 rmed illness 
(February to April, September to October).
Sample-size calculations were based on a comparison 
of the expected proportion, P, of all cases of laboratory-
confi
 rmed infl
 uenza that occurred by age 6 months in 
infants whose mothers received trivalent inactivated 
infl
 uenza vaccine to the null value, P0, using exact 
binomial calculations and assuming equal total follow-
up time in each vaccine group (h=1). For the intention-
to-treat analysis, we assumed a laboratory-confi
 rmed 
infl
 uenza attack rate of 2·2% by age 6 months in infants 
born to recipients of quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine 
and a 55% reduction in the attack rate in infants of 
recipients of trivalent inactivated infl
 uenza vaccine, to 
0·99%; therefore, p=0·31034 and P0=0·5. For a one-
sided α of 0·025, 77 cases of laboratory-confi
 rmed 
infl
 uenza were needed to ensure 90% power for the 
intention-to-treat analysis, implying a need for about 
4828 participants. Allowing for a 10% loss to follow-up, 
the 
sample 
size 
calculated 
became 
about 
5370 participants. For the per-protocol analysis, we 
assumed vaccine effi
  cacy to be 60%—ie, a laboratory-
confi
 rmed infl
 uenza attack rate of 0·88% by age 
6 months in infants born to recipients of trivalent

inactivated infl
 uenza vaccine. To ensure 90% power to 
show a vaccine effi
  cacy of more than 5%, 67 cases of 
laboratory-confi
 rmed infl
 uenza were needed, implying a 
sample size of 4352 participants. Allowing for a 20% loss 
to follow-up, or for the mother receiving vaccine less 
than 14 days before delivery, the sample-size requirement 
became about 5440 participants.
Enrolment was closed once 77 cases of infant 
laboratory-confi
 rmed infl
 uenza were recorded, but 
surveillance continued until the infants reached 
6 months of age. A Data Safety Monitoring Board 
oversaw the study and reviewed data on a regular basis.

Results
We did this trial from Sept 12, 2011, to Jan 28, 2014. 
Between Sept 12, 2011, and April 18, 2013, we randomly 
assigned 4193 women to receive trivalent inactivated 
infl
 uenza vaccine (n=2108) or quadrivalent meningo-
coccal vaccine (n=2085; fi
 gure 1). Baseline characteristics 
were similar between groups (table 1). One (<1%) 
woman, who was inadvertently vaccinated twice (once 
with each vaccine), was followed up as part of her initial 
assignment group. 4087 (97%) women remained in the 
study until delivery; 3661 (87%) women were followed 
up until 6 months after delivery (fi
 gure 1). There were 
4105 livebirths; 1797 (87%) of 2064 infants in the trivalent 
inactivated infl
 uenza vaccine group and 1793 (88%) of 
2041 infants in the quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine 
group were followed up until age 6 months (fi
 gure 1). 
Due to political upheaval in Mali, study personnel were 
unable to do household visits for 1 week in March, 2012, 
and 2 weeks in May, 2012.
We recorded 5279 infl
 uenza-like illness episodes in 
2789 infants younger than 6 months, of which 131 (2%) 
episodes were laboratory-confi
 rmed infl
 uenza. 129 (98%)

group vs n=52 in the trivalent inactivated infl
 uenza vaccine 
group). 116 (90%) fi
 rst episodes of laboratory-confi
 rmed 
infl
 uenza were in infants of women vaccinated at least 
14 days prepartum. The 77 cases needed to complete 
vaccine effi
  cacy analyses were reached by April 16, 2013; 
surveillance of post-partum women and their infants 
continued until infants reached age 6 months. One 
episode of laboratory-confi
 rmed infl
 uenza was associated 
with malaria parasitaemia.
Overall infant vaccine effi
  cacy was 33·1% (95% CI 
3·7–53·9) in the intention-to-treat population, and 37·3% 
(7·6–57·8) in the per-protocol population (table 2). Notably, 
cumulative vaccine effi
  cacy in infants in the intention-to-
treat population was 67·9% in the fi
 rst 4 months of follow-
up, fell to 57·3% at the fi
 fth month of surveillance, and 
dropped precipitously in the last month of follow-up, by 
which time protection was no longer evident (table 2). 
Cumulative vaccine effi
  cacy in infants in the per-protocol 
population was 70·2% in the fi
 rst 4 months of follow-up 
and 60·7% at the fi
 fth month of surveillance (table 2). 
Within the trivalent inactivated infl
 uenza vaccine group, 
Cox regression analysis of the relative risk of laboratory-
confi
 rmed infl
 uenza showed that risk of infl
 uenza 
decreased when trivalent inactivated infl
 uenza vaccine had 
been given at least 15 days prepartum (p=0·02; appendix 
p 7). As long as the vaccine was given at least 15 days before 
delivery, no additional benefi
 t was noted in women who 
had even longer intervals; women in neither the trivalent 
inactivated infl
 uenza vaccine group (Cox regression 
p=0·90) nor the quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine 
group (p=0·73) had a signifi
 cant change in rates of 
laboratory-confi
 rmed infl
 uenza as the time from delivery 
to vaccination increased above 14 days.
102 fi
 rst episodes of laboratory-confi
 rmed infl
 uenza in 
infants were due to infl
 uenza type A, including 41 H1N1, 
59 H3N2, and two non-subtypeable viruses, and to 
27 infl
 uenza B viruses (table 3). In the fi
 rst 5 months of 
life, vaccine effi
  cacy against infl
 uenza A was 64·5% 
overall, and 66·6% for H1N1 and 62·9% for H3N2 
(table 3). No vaccine was eff
 ective against infl
 uenza 
type B in infants (table 3). In the fi
 rst 6 months of life, no 
vaccine was eff
 ective against infl
 uenza-like illness 
(1% effi
  cacy, 95% CI –7·0 to 8·5).
During the 29 months of surveillance of infants for 
laboratory-confi
 rmed illness, the 131 circulating infl
 uenza 
viruses detected by RT-PCR changed over time and 
included 41 H1N1 viruses, 59 H3N2 viruses, two 
additional infl
 uenza A viruses that could not be subtyped, 
and 29 infl
 uenza B viruses (appendix p 8). We attempted 
to culture infl
 uenza virus from these 131 RT-PCR-positive 
infant clinical specimens to enable more defi
 nitive typing 
of viruses. Two contaminated samples could not be 
processed. Of the remaining 129 specimens, 65 grew 
infl
 uenza viruses, which were typed as A/California/
7/2009(H1N1[pandemic]-like; 
n=32) 
detected 
from 
March, 2012, to October, 2013; A/Victoria/361/2011
(H3N2; n=11) detected from September, 2012, to October, 
2013; and B/Brisbane/03/2007 (Yamagata lineage; n=22) 
detected from November, 2012, to November, 2013. The 
H1N1 strains matched those in the trivalent inactivated 
infl
 uenza vaccine formulations; the H3N2 strains 
matched those in the second formulation and the B 
strains were of the same lineage as that within the second 
formulation.
From Sept 12, 2011, to Jan 28, 2014, we noted 
1385 episodes of infl
 uenza-like illness in participating 
women; 52 (4%) episodes were laboratory-confi
 rmed 
illness. 51 (96%) cases of laboratory-confi
 rmed illness 
were fi
 rst episodes. One episode was associated with 
malaria parasitaemia. Appendix p 9 summarises these 
cases. There were three episodes of severe acute 
respiratory infection, all of which were infl
 uenza 
negative. Overall vaccine effi
  cacy was 70·3% (95% CI 
42·2–85·8). Effi
  cacy against infl
 uenza type A in women 
was 72·0% and against type B was 73·3% (table 3). 
Subtype-specifi
 c effi
  cacy against H1N1 was 83·3% and 
could not be measured against H3N2 due to the few 
cases detected. Vaccine effi
  cacy was 76·6% (95% CI 
28·4–94·3) in pregnant women and 70·1% (28·0–89·1) 
in the post-partum period (appendix p 9). No vaccine was 
eff
 ective against maternal infl
 uenza-like illness (2·2% 
effi
  cacy, 95% CI –10·5 to 13·5).

which we tested samples from 11 H1N1 cases (including 
a pair of twins) and 33 birthdate-matched controls (plus 
or minus 30 days). The remaining 137 pairs included 
46 pairs with an infant with laboratory-confi
 rmed illness, 
and 91 pairs with an infant who did not have laboratory-
confi
 rmed illness but might have had infl
 uenza-like 
illness; these pairs represented a convenience sample of 
participants who completed the study. By age 3 months, 
infant geometric mean titres (GMT) had decreased by 
more than 50%, although more infants in the trivalent 
inactivated infl
 uenza vaccine group had haemag-
glutination inhibition antibody titres of 40 or more 
(fi
 gure 2, appendix pp 10, 11). At age 6 months, 
haemagglutination inhibition antibody titres of 40 or 
more did not diff
 er signifi
 cantly between infants in either 
vaccine group, although maternal titres remained higher 
in the trivalent inactivated infl
 uenza vaccine group 
(appendix p 11). Of note, GMT increased in the 
quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine group at age 
6 months, probably due to natural immunity acquired 
between ages 3 and 6 months. As haemagglutination 
inhibition antibody titres decreased with age in the 
trivalent inactivated infl
 uenza vaccine group, effi
  cacy 
also decreased (fi
 gure 2).
The most frequently reported local and systemic 
reactions were pain at the injection site and febrile 
sensation (appendix p 12). Pain at the injection site was 
more commonly reported in women given quadrivalent 
meningococcal vaccine than in those given trivalent 
inactivated infl
 uenza vaccine (n=253 vs n=132; p<0·0001), 
although reactions were mostly mild (92%; appendix p 12). 
Rates of unrelated obstetrical and non-obstetrical serious 
adverse events in women were similar between groups 
(appendix p 13). The most commonly reported events 
were hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, which were 
equally common among both vaccine groups; 1% of 
participants in each group had pre-eclampsia (p=0·89; 
appendix p 13). No serious adverse event was related to 
study treatment. There were fi
 ve (<1%) unrelated deaths 
among study participants (n=2 in the trivalent inactivated 
infl
 uenza vaccine group and n=3 in the quadrivalent 
meningococcal vaccine group); two (40%) patients died 
due to obstetrical complications and three (60%) patients 
died after the 42 day period after delivery.
Although rates of serious adverse events in infants 
were similar between groups, presumed neonatal 
infection was more common in infants in the trivalent 
inactivated infl
 uenza vaccine group than in those in the 
quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine group (n=60 vs 
n=37; p=0·02; appendix p 14). No serious adverse events 
in infants were related to maternal vaccination. 89 infants 
died: 52 (59%) infants in the trivalent inactivated 
infl
 uenza vaccine group and 37 (41%) infants in the 
quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine group (p=0·13; 
appendix p 14); no deaths were due to laboratory-
confi
 rmed infl
 uenza. Appendix p 15 summarises the 
timing and causes of death.
Per-protocol analysis of the number of infants with a 
Ballard score less than 33 yielded an overall prematurity 
rate of 1·8%, which did not correlate with rates measured 
using date of last menstrual period or results of fi
 rst-
trimester ultrasounds (appendix p 16). 358 (9%) liveborn 
infants were born at a low birthweight; there was no 
diff
 erence in birthweight between vaccine groups 
(p=0·20). Furthermore, there was no diff
 erence in 
birthweight among infants born during infl
 uenza season.
Discussion
Here we report results of the largest randomised 
controlled trial so far of trivalent inactivated infl
 uenza 
vaccine in pregnant women, which was undertaken in 
Mali, where infant and maternal mortality rates are 
among the world’s highest.14 Trivalent inactivated 
infl
 uenza vaccine elicited robust antibody responses and 
women and their infants were signifi
 cantly protected 
against laboratory-confi
 rmed infl
 uenza, corroborating 
results from Bangladesh (63% vaccine effi
  cacy, 95% CI 
5–85) and South Africa (48·8%, 11·6–70·4),10,11 and 
supporting WHO recommendations that pregnant 
women should be the highest priority target for infl
 uenza 
vaccination.20 Because pregnant women and infants are 
at high risk for severe and fatal infl
 uenza illness even in 
affl
  uent countries, our fi
 ndings showing effi
  cacy of 
maternal immunisation in severely resource-constrained 
Mali, one of the world’s least developed countries, 
constitute encouraging new information.
Maternal immunisation with trivalent inactivated 
infl
 uenza vaccine provided robust protection to infants 
during the fi
 rst 4 months of life. Thereafter, as 
haemagglutination inhibition antibody titres diminished, 
effi
  cacy decreased and was no longer evident at month 6 of 
follow-up. These observations support the contention that 
transplacental maternal antibody protects infants against

laboratory-confi

infl
 uenza. 
Haemagglutination 
inhibition antibody kinetics resembled those reported in 
Bangladesh21 and South Africa,22 and align with fi
 ndings 
from seroepidemiological studies23,24 showing that by age 
6 months most Malian infants no longer have protective 
titres of maternally derived measles and Haemophilus 
infl
 uenzae type b antibodies.
Infl
 uenza vaccine was well tolerated by pregnant 
women in our study, corroborating increasing evidence 
supporting the safety of trivalent inactivated infl
 uenza 
vaccine during pregnancy.25 The Bangladesh trial 
reported that infants born during the infl
 uenza season to 
women who received infl
 uenza vaccine had higher 
birthweights than did those born to women who received 
control vaccine during that period.12 In Mali and South 
Africa there was no benefi
 cial eff
 ect of maternal 
immunisation with trivalent inactivated infl
 uenza 
vaccine on birthweight in infants born anytime during 
the study,11 including during infl
 uenza season. Exclusion 
of women with high-risk pregnancies from our study and 
inclusion of women late in pregnancy might have made 
it diffi
  cult to detect diff
 erences in birthweight due to 
maternal disorders. Moreover, infants born to women 
who had been in the study longer had higher birthweights 
than did those vaccinated closer to delivery, further 
decreasing the likelihood of detecting a diff
 erence 
between vaccine groups.
While demonstrating the effi
  cacy and safety of 
maternal infl
 uenza immunisation, we were also able to 
address the technical and logistical feasibility of 
implementation of such a programme in Mali. The trial 
was well received by the community as the study team 
worked at local health centres alongside routine prenatal 
care (that included the administration of tetanus toxoid) 
to enrol more than 4000 women. The workfl
 ow pattern 
for administration of study vaccine paralleled that of 
tetanus toxoid administration and was well accepted by 
local providers. Nevertheless, remaining aspects, such as 
the availability of an appropriate vaccine, access to 
prenatal care, and cost, would aff
 ect implementation of a 
maternal infl
 uenza immunisation programme.
We noted seasonal infl
 uenza peaks with diff
 erent 
infl
 uenza viruses from year to year, and these fl
 uctuations 
aff
 ected vaccine effi
  cacy. Notably, vaccinated mothers 
were signifi
 cantly protected against infl
 uenza B, whereas 
infants were not. The probable explanation relates to 
when diff
 erent B-virus lineages circulated. Cases of 
type B laboratory-confi
 rmed infl
 uenza in infants born to 
mothers vaccinated with trivalent inactivated infl
 uenza 
vaccine were Yamagata lineage infections, whereas 
mothers had received B/Brisbane/60/2008 (Victoria 
lineage) vaccine. By the time infants born to women 
who received Yamagata lineage-containing vaccine 
(B/Wisconsin/1/2010) were exposed to infl
 uenza, little 
type B was circulating. This fi
 nding shows the complexity 
of vaccine selection and supports the use of quadrivalent 
infl
 uenza vaccines containing both type-B lineages. 
Timeliness of importation of newly formulated vaccine, 
promptness of initiation of vaccination of pregnant 
women and the types of circulating infl
 uenza viruses in 
relation to vaccine viruses, all aff
 ect vaccine effi
  cacy. If 
maternal vaccination is to succeed in Mali, infants born 
in September to October will need to be protected. 
Because 
northern 
hemisphere 
infl
 uenza 
vaccine 
becomes available in August or September, immunisation 
will need to be implemented almost immediately upon 
vaccine importation. The second peak (February to April) 
does not present this logistical issue. An alternative 
strategy for countries with an infl
 uenza epidemiology 
similar to Mali is to use vaccine with an extended shelf-
life throughout the year.26 This approach would allow 
immunisation of Malian pregnant women in the months 
leading up to the September to October peak before the 
newer formulation is available.
Another factor infl
 uencing the overall eff
 ect and 
sustainability of maternal immunisation in countries 
such as Mali is access to health-care interventions. The 
2014 Demographic and Health Survey reported that 
whereas 95·2% of pregnant women in Bamako and 
91·8% in other urban areas had at least one prenatal visit 
during their most recent pregnancy,27 this was true for 
only 69·3% of pregnant women in rural Mali. Barriers 
limiting access to health care in rural areas should be 
overcome to achieve high maternal immunisation 
coverage.
As other similarly low-resourced countries consider the 
implementation of a maternal infl
 uenza vaccination 
programme, the cost will also aff
 ect the feasibility. Since 
we did not observe an eff
 ect of trivalent inactivated 
infl
 uenza vaccine on birthweight, the cost-eff
 ectiveness 
of implementation of the vaccine in pregnancy to prevent 
infant infl
 uenza in Mali will hinge on prevention of 
severe illness and infant deaths. However, our study was 
not powered to measure the effi
  cacy of trivalent 
inactivated infl
 uenza vaccine in the prevention of severe 
laboratory-confi
 rmed infl
 uenza. Furthermore, because 
we visited households of study participants weekly, and 
intervened when illnesses were encountered by treating 
and referring participants earlier than they might have 
sought care in our absence, we probably interrupted 
progression of illness in many infants. Addressing this 
gap will require a diff
 erent trial design and a larger 
sample size.
Our study unequivocally demonstrates effi
  cacy of 
maternal immunisation against laboratory-confi
 rmed 
infl
 uenza among infants and mothers, and shows high 
acceptability and logistical feasibility, thereby paving the 
way for a larger trial to assess prevention of severe 
laboratory-confi
 rmed infl
 uenza leading to hospital 
admission in infants. Our fi
 ndings support a vision that, 
in the future, developing countries might use the 
maternal immunisation platform to deliver vaccines 
to prevent respiratory syncytial virus,28 pertussis,29 
infl
 uenza,13,26 and tetanus.30
