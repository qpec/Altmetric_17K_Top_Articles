S
troke is currently the third leading cause of death and dis-
ability in developed countries,1 emphasizing its impor-
tance as a leading global health problem. Although the overall 
incidence of strokes has been declining in developed coun-
tries during the past 2 decades, the absolute number of people 
who have a stroke every year and live with its consequences 
is increasing.1,2 Moreover, there is troubling evidence of an 
increasing incidence of strokes among young adults.3
Studies have shown that >90% of the stroke burden is 
attributable to modifiable risk factors, such as tobacco smok-
ing, alcohol consumption, poor diet, low physical activity, 
and hypertension.1,4 It has been demonstrated that several 
of these risk factors may be already present in late adoles-
cence,5 highlighting the potential for early identification 
and intervention. Recently, a growing body of research has 
linked cannabis use to stroke, particularly to those occurring 
before 45 years of age.6,7 It seems cannabis-associated strokes 
usually occur in chronic or current cannabis users who also 
smoke tobacco,8 either in combination with or immediately 
after cannabis use. The cerebrovascular effects of cannabis 
highlighted as possible mechanisms for subsequent strokes 
include hypotension, altered cerebral vasomotor function, 
vasospasm, cerebral vasoconstriction, and swings in blood 
pressure. However, currently there is a dearth of epidemio-
logical data supporting an association between cannabis use 
and stroke.8,9
Thus, our current knowledge about cannabis-associated 
strokes is based almost exclusively on clinical reports.10 
Although there have been a few general population studies, 
these have been mostly based on hospital records and are, there-
fore, retrospective in nature. In general, many of these studies 
lack the ability to address questions of temporality, possible 
dose–response associations, and the importance of other con-
comitant factors (eg, alcohol and tobacco use). Consequently, 
whether cannabis is to be regarded as a risk factor for stroke is 
still unclear.
A recent study of the largest inpatient database in the United 
States found that cannabis use was associated with a 17% 
Background and Purpose—Current knowledge on cannabis use in relation to stroke is based almost exclusively on clinical 
reports. By using a population-based cohort, we aimed to find out whether there was an association between cannabis use 
and early-onset stroke, when accounting for the use of tobacco and alcohol.
Methods—The cohort comprises 49 321 Swedish men, born between 1949 and 1951, who were conscripted into compulsory 
military service between the ages of 18 and 20. All men answered 2 detailed questionnaires at conscription and were 
subject to examinations of physical aptitude, psychological functioning, and medical status. Information on stroke events 
up to ≈60 years of age was obtained from national databases; this includes strokes experienced before 45 years of age.
Results—No associations between cannabis use in young adulthood and strokes experienced ≤45 years of age or beyond 
were found in multivariable models: cannabis use >50 times, hazard ratios=0.93 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.34–
2.57) and 0.95 (95% CI, 0.59–1.53). Although an almost doubled risk of ischemic stroke was observed in those with 
cannabis use >50 times, this risk was attenuated when adjusted for tobacco usage: hazards ratio=1.47 (95% CI, 0.83–
2.56). Smoking ≥20 cigarettes per day was clearly associated both with strokes before 45 years of age, hazards ratio=5.04 
(95% CI, 2.80–9.06), and with strokes throughout the follow-up, hazards ratio=2.15 (95% CI, 1.61–2.88).
Conclusions—We found no evident association between cannabis use in young adulthood and stroke, including strokes 
before 45 years of age. Tobacco smoking, however, showed a clear, dose–response shaped association with stroke.

increase in the risk of hospitalization because of acute ischemic 
stroke,6 even if both tobacco and amphetamine use constituted 
bigger risks. A previous case–control study in Australia found 
that patients experiencing an ischemic stroke or transient isch-
emic attack were more likely to use cannabis than nonstroke 
patients.11 However, after adjusting for tobacco use, an asso-
ciation between cannabis and stroke could not be confirmed. 
Another cross-sectional study from the United States found 
that cannabis abuse or dependence was associated with isch-
emic but not hemorrhagic stroke.12 Furthermore, in this study, 
use of tobacco and cocaine were more strongly associated with 
stroke, and amphetamine was the only drug that increased the 
risk of death from stroke. In a recent Australian study examin-
ing 7455 adults in the general community,13 weekly cannabis 
users had a higher rate of nonfatal stroke or transient ischemic 
attack than noncannabis users. However, because this was a 
cross-sectional study, a causal relationship between stroke and 
cannabis use could not be inferred. Thus, longitudinal studies 
in the general population are lacking.
Considering the fact that cannabis is the most used illicit 
drug worldwide, with an estimated 180 million annual users,14 
the interest in its possible health risks seems warranted. The 
current wave of decriminalization and liberalization of medi-
cal marijuana in the United States and in other countries may 
lead to its more widespread use. This potential makes it impor-
tant to address the possible adverse health effects associated 
with cannabis, as they may begin to occur in the population at 
a greater frequency.15
By using a population-based cohort comprising 49 321 
Swedish men, with data on cannabis use in late adolescence 
and on tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption, and several 
other risk factors and information on strokes from national 
health registers, we aimed to clarify the association between 
cannabis use and early onset of stroke including stroke before 
45 years of age, when contrasted with tobacco and alcohol use.
Methods
Study Population
Data came from a national survey of Swedish men conscripted into 
military service in 1969/70, between 18 and 20 years of age. The 
survey has been described in detail elsewhere.16 All men underwent 
a 2-day screening procedure, including an extensive health examina-
tion and the completion of 2 questionnaires—one focusing on social 
and behavioral factors and the other on substance use. Only 2% to 
3% of the Swedish male population was exempted from conscription 
at this time, attributable to either severe disablements or congenital 
disorders.
Ethical approval was granted by the Research Ethics Committee of 
the Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm.
Assessment of Exposures (Cannabis, Tobacco,  
and Alcohol)
The conscripts were asked whether they had ever used drugs, which 
drugs they had used (from a list of alternatives), drug most commonly 
used, and frequency of use (fixed alternatives). Based on the most 
commonly used drugs and the frequency of use, we divided cannabis 
use into never, 1 to 10 times, 11 to 50 times, and >50 times. Regarding 
tobacco smoking, a single question was asked, “How many cigarettes 
do you smoke per day?” We divided tobacco smoking into no smok-
ing, 1 to 10 cigarettes per day, 11 to 20 cigarettes per day, or >20 ciga-
rettes per day. As for alcohol consumption, the conscripts were asked 
to report the average quantity and frequency of medium or strong 
beer, wine, and strong spirits that they drank. Through subsequent 
standard estimates of drink size (10–12 g 100% ethanol), consump-
tion in grams of 100% alcohol per week was calculated.17 As in pre-
vious studies of this cohort,18 we divided alcohol consumption into 
abstention/never drinking (0 g 100% alcohol/week), light (1–100 g), 
moderate (101–250 g), and high (>250 g).
Assessment of Other Risk Factors (Covariates)
The conscription examination also provided information on body 
weight and height,19 resting systolic and diastolic blood pressures,20 
cardiorespiratory fitness,21 and any disorders as diagnosed by a phy-
sician. Body weight and height were used to determine body mass 
index, that is, kilograms per meter squared. Blood pressure measure-
ments were made after 5 to 10 minutes of rest on the first day of 
the conscript examination. Cardiorespiratory fitness was rated on a 
scale from 1 to 9 based on a bicycle ergonometric test. Diagnoses 
of diabetes mellitus and migraine were recorded according to their 
International Classification of Diseases-Eighth Revision codes: 250 
and 346, respectively. In addition, studying versus not studying at 
time of conscription was used to indicate the men’s educational level. 
Furthermore, by linking conscripts’ national identity numbers with 
parental records (held by Statistics Sweden), we obtained data on their 
parental history of cardiovascular disease (CVD) (from the National 
Cause of Death Register and National Board of Health and Welfare 
in Sweden) and participants’ socioeconomic position during child-
hood.22 A parental history of CVD was defined as any CVD-related 
death (mother or father) at ≤65 years of age. Information on child-
hood socioeconomic position came from the National Population and 
Housing Census of 1960 (99% response rate) and was classified on 
the basis of the head of household’s (usually father’s) occupation.
Assessment of Stroke
Participants were followed to assess the initial occurrence of strokes 
(fatal or nonfatal) from 1971 until 2009, that is, between ages ≈20 
and ≈59 years. Information on the onset of any stroke was obtained 
by record linkage with the National Hospital Discharge Register, 
administered by the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare. 
The HDR covers all public inpatient care in Sweden and is complete 
as of 1987. As the incidence of strokes before age ≈36 to 37 years in 
general is low, only a few cases of stroke could be missed because 
of incomplete registers. Personal records were also linked with the 
National Cause of Death Register for information on death because 
of stroke. Codes according to the International Classification of 
Diseases code were as follows: 8th Revision, all strokes: 430, 431, 
433, and 434; ischemic stroke: 433 to 434; 9th Revision, all strokes: 
430 to 432, 434, and 436; ischemic stroke: 434; 10th Revision, all 
strokes, including transient ischemic attack: I60–I64, I66, and G45; 
ischemic stroke: I63.
Statistical Analysis
We used Cox proportional-hazards regression to examine cannabis 
use in young adulthood as a possible risk factor for all strokes and 
ischemic strokes until 59 years of age. Because of a limited number of 
cases, the association between cannabis use and hemorrhagic stroke 
was not examined separately. The association with strokes occur-
ring before 45 years of age was also examined, but because of low 
numbers, these cases were not examined separately by stroke type. 
Censoring was made at the time of an initial fatal or nonfatal stroke, 
time of death, date of emigration, or December 31, 2009 (whichever 
occurred first).
After computation of crude models, the following were estimated: 
(1) a model adjusting for body mass index, systolic and diastolic 
blood pressure, cardiorespiratory fitness, migraine, diabetes melli-
tus, and early parental CVD; (2) additionally adjusting for indicators 
of socioeconomic status until young adulthood; and (3) additionally 
adjusting for tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption. Statistical 
analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4 for Windows.

We had complete data for all examined variables from the 45 081 
men included in our analysis. The results from our sample were simi-
lar to those of the whole cohort when we included participants with 
missing data (8.8%).
Results
In total, 1037 first-time strokes occurred during the follow-
up period until 59 years of age. Among these, ≈48% were 
ischemic strokes (n=498) and 23% were hemorrhagic strokes 
(n=233). Before 45 years of age, 192 first-time strokes had 
occurred; ≈40% were ischemic strokes, and 27% were hemor-
rhagic strokes.
The following factors were significantly more common 
among men who had a stroke before 60 years of age: a paren-
tal history of CVD, being overweight, low cardiorespira-
tory fitness, low socioeconomic position in childhood, short 
schooling, heavy smoking, and high alcohol consumption 
(Table 1). Although not statistically significant, higher propor-
tions of men with a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus or migraine 
at the conscription examination were represented among those 
experiencing a stroke before 60 years of age. High blood pres-
sure and heavy cannabis use seemed to be more prevalent 
among the men having a stroke before 45 years of age but did 
not differ to the same extent between men with and without 
stroke when followed until 60 years of age.
Cannabis use showed no association with stroke before 45 
years of age (Table 2). Both cigarette smoking and alcohol 
use, on the contrary, showed clear dose–response shaped asso-
ciations with stroke before 45 years of age in the crude mod-
els. Specifically, the incidence of stroke before 45 years of age 
was >6 times higher among men who reported smoking >20 
cigarettes per day than in nonsmoking men and was 4 times 
higher among men reporting high alcohol consumption than 
in men reporting no alcohol use. However, in multivariable 
models, only cigarette smoking—not alcohol consumption—
seemed robustly associated with stroke before 45 years of age.
There was no significant association between canna-
bis use in young adulthood and overall incidence of stroke 
until 59 years of age (Table 3). At the same time, there was 
a clear, dose–response shaped association between cigarettes 
(tobacco) smoked and stroke, and furthermore, an associa-
tion between alcohol consumption and stroke was suggested. 
When adjusting for cigarette smoking and alcohol consump-
tion, we found that none of the cannabis groups (1–10, 11–50, 
and >50) showed an elevated hazard of stroke.
Crude models demonstrated that the hazard of ischemic 
stroke until 59 years of age was almost 2 times higher among 
men who were heavy cannabis users in young adulthood than 
among nonusers. At the same time, a dose–response shaped 
association with ischemic stroke was seen only for cigarette 
smoking, that is, not for cannabis use or alcohol consump-
tion. In multivariable-adjusted models, the elevated hazards 
of ischemic stroke were attenuated both in relation to heavy 
cannabis use and in relation to high alcohol consumption.

Discussion
Our study suggests no clear association between cannabis use 
in young adulthood and early stroke. The elevated hazard of 
ischemic stroke among heavy users of cannabis diminished 
after adjustments for cigarette smoking and alcohol consump-
tion were made. Furthermore, the association between alco-
hol consumption and stroke was weak in the fully adjusted 
model. Cigarette smoking, on the contrary, showed a clear, 
dose–response shaped association with stroke in all models.
Our results on cannabis use and stroke did not confirm pre-
vious research,13 and there are several possible explanations 
for this. First, the population-based study by Hemachandra 
et al was cross-sectional, with significantly less time occur-
ring between cannabis use (past year) and stroke than ours. 
Additionally, that study did not include any detailed informa-
tion on the amount of tobacco smoked, even though—as seen 
in our study—the number of cigarettes smoked is of clear 
importance in relation to stroke. Furthermore, it was based 
on self-reported data only and included transient ischemic 
attack, which could not be examined separately in the present 
study. In the study by Westover et al,12 cannabis abuse and 
dependence were found to be associated with ischemic stroke, 
although tobacco use constituted a bigger risk.
In contrast, Barber et al11 were not able to find an association 
between cannabis and stroke, independent of tobacco. This 
finding is in line with our results. Consistent with previous 
studies,23 we found heavy tobacco smokers in late adolescence 
to have a 2-fold risk of stroke anytime during the follow-up and 
5 times the risk of stroke before 45 years of age, compared with 
nonsmokers, after adjustment for several risk factors. However, 
unlike previous studies,24 we did not find a clear association 
between high alcohol consumption and the risk of stroke once 
tobacco smoking was included as a covariate.
Important to note is the close link between tobacco smoking 
and cannabis use in our sample. In fact, few cases of stroke 
occurred among those men who reported having used canna-
bis frequently but used tobacco or alcohol infrequently, and 
almost no cases of stroke before 45 years of age occurred 
among them. Therefore, there is little evidence of cannabis 
independently affecting stroke. Furthermore, this highlights 
the difficulty in controlling for confounds; the association 
between cannabis use and stroke is not quantifiable in both 
users and nonusers of tobacco or users and nonusers of alcohol.
Recently, the World Health Organization25 highlighted the 
urgent need for more studies on the potential health risks of 
cannabis (eg, stroke and CVD) and the need to better control 
the potential confounds of tobacco smoking. It is well known 
that cannabis and tobacco are often mixed together, and stud-
ies have reported that ≤90% of cannabis users are also tobacco 
smokers.26 Moreover, tobacco is commonly added to cannabis 
cigarettes, so-called joints, so that the 2 substances are used 
simultaneously.27 There is some evidence that tobacco may 
increase the rewarding effects of cannabis,27 which may help 
explain the high prevalence of comorbid use.
Some limitations with our study need to be acknowledged. 
First, there is no follow-up data on the baseline measurements. 
Accordingly, we have no information on body mass index, 
blood pressures, and cardiorespiratory fitness later in the life

course of these men. These are all factors that may contribute 
to, and explain, later strokes. Also, we do not know to what 
extent our sample have continued or discontinued using can-
nabis, alcohol, and tobacco into adulthood. The rate of overall 
drug use, including cannabis, in our cohort was low (11%, 
of which 9% was cannabis), and in contexts where rates are 
higher, an impact of cannabis on stroke may still be worth 
investigating. Moreover, the overall drug rate in our cohort 
was lower in comparison to the anonymous conscript surveys 
that took place both the year before and the year after (18% 
in 1968 and 16% in 1970).28 Consequently, self-reported can-
nabis use is likely subject to under-reporting. On the contrary, 
studies of the same group of Swedish conscripts have shown 
that the young men generally gave correct information on 
their drug use,29 suggesting that the material is valid for epi-
demiological analysis. Because this study only included men 
in Sweden born around 1950, the generalizability is limited. 
There are studies suggesting that some ethnic groups may face 
higher risks of stroke,30 but whether this in turn would affect 
an association between cannabis and stroke is uncertain. Also,

 270  Stroke  February 2017
a meta-analysis by Peters et al,31 reported no sex differences in 
the relationship between tobacco smoking and stroke, indicat-
ing that our results may hold for women as well.
The strengths of our study include a large population-based 
cohort of 45 081 men and the long-term follow-up, enabling 
the analyses of stroke from early adulthood to middle age. 
The Swedish conscript survey is the longest follow-up to 
date of participants with baseline data about cannabis use. 
Additionally, we had information on several potential con-
founders known to be of importance. The follow-up data were 
obtained by record linkage covering all public inpatient care 
in Sweden from 1987 onwards. As the incidence of strokes 
before age ≈ 36 to 37 years is low, few cases of stroke could 
be missed because of a lack of coverage.
Conclusions
Previous studies on cannabis and stroke are mainly clinical, 
retrospective, and cross-sectional. We have expanded current 
knowledge by examining cannabis use in young adulthood in 
relation to the subsequent risk of stroke in a large population-
based cohort. We found no evident association between can-
nabis use and stroke, including stroke before 45 years of age. 
Tobacco smoking, however, showed a clear, dose–response 
shaped association with stroke across multivariable models.
Sources of Funding
This study was supported by grants provided by the Research Council 
for Health, Working Life and Welfare (Forte 2014-0691). The fund-
ing source had no role in designing and executing the study.
