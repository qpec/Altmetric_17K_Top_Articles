BACKGROUND
Alzheimer’s disease is characterized by amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary 
tangles. The humanized monoclonal antibody solanezumab was designed to increase the 
clearance from the brain of soluble Aβ, peptides that may lead to toxic effects in the 
synapses and precede the deposition of fibrillary amyloid.
METHODS
We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial involving patients with mild 
dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease, defined as a Mini–Mental State Examination (MMSE) 
score of 20 to 26 (on a scale from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating better cognition) 
and with amyloid deposition shown by means of florbetapir positron-emission tomography 
or Aβ1-42 measurements in cerebrospinal fluid. Patients were randomly assigned to receive 
solanezumab at a dose of 400 mg or placebo intravenously every 4 weeks for 76 weeks. The 
primary outcome was the change from baseline to week 80 in the score on the 14-item 
cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog14; scores range 
from 0 to 90, with higher scores indicating greater cognitive impairment).
RESULTS
A total of 2129 patients were enrolled, of whom 1057 were assigned to receive solanezu-
mab and 1072 to receive placebo. The mean change from baseline in the ADAS-cog14 
score was 6.65 in the solanezumab group and 7.44 in the placebo group, with no sig-
nificant between-group difference at week 80 (difference, −0.80; 95% confidence interval, 
−1.73 to 0.14; P 
= 
0.10). As a result of the failure to reach significance with regard to the 
primary outcome in the prespecified hierarchical analysis, the secondary outcomes were 
considered to be descriptive and are reported without significance testing. The change 
from baseline in the MMSE score was −3.17 in the solanezumab group and −3.66 in the 
placebo group. Adverse cerebral edema or effusion lesions that were observed on mag-
netic resonance imaging after randomization occurred in 1 patient in the solanezumab 
group and in 2 in the placebo group.
CONCLUSIONS
Solanezumab at a dose of 400 mg administered every 4 weeks in patients with mild 
Alzheimer’s disease did not significantly affect cognitive decline. (Funded by Eli Lilly; 
EXPEDITION3 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01900665.)

T
he neuropathological hallmarks 
of Alzheimer’s disease include extracellu-
lar plaques containing amyloid beta (Aβ) 
and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles contain-
ing hyperphosphorylated tau protein,1 along with 
synaptic and neuronal losses.2 The Aβ hypothe-
sis of the mechanism of Alzheimer’s disease pro-
poses that early pathogenesis of the disease re-
sults from the overproduction of or reduced 
clearance of Aβ, leading to the formation of 
oligomers, fibrils, and neuritic Aβ plaques.3,4 
Treatments that slow the production of Aβ or 
that increase the clearance of Aβ may slow the 
progression of Alzheimer’s disease. Solanezumab, 
a humanized immunoglobulin G1 monoclonal 
antibody that binds to the mid-domain of the 
Aβ peptide, was designed to increase clearance 
from the brain of soluble Aβ, peptides that may 
lead to toxic effects in the synapses at a stage 
before the deposition of the fibrillary form of 
the protein.
In two completed phase 3 clinical trials 
 
(EXPEDITION and EXPEDITION2), solanezumab 
did not significantly reduce the decline in cogni-
tion or function (e.g., activities of daily living and 
community involvement) in patients who had 
received a clinical diagnosis of mild-to-moderate 
Alzheimer’s disease.5 However, in prespecified 
pooled secondary analyses, patients with mild 
Alzheimer’s disease who were treated with solanez-
umab had less cognitive decline by approximately 
34% and less functional decline by approximate-
ly 18% than did patients who received placebo.6 
We report the results of a third double-blind, 
placebo-controlled phase 3 trial (EXPEDITION3), 
which enrolled only patients who had mild Alz-
heimer’s disease, defined as a Mini–Mental State 
Examination (MMSE) score of 20 to 26 (on a 
scale from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating 
better cognition), and had biomarker evidence of 
cerebral beta-amyloid deposition. This trial was 
intended to further investigate the secondary ef-
ficacy analyses from the earlier two trials.
Methods
Patient Population and Trial Design
This international trial included male and female 
patients, 55 to 90 years of age, who met the diag-
nostic criteria for probable Alzheimer’s disease 
according to the National Institute of Neuro-
logical and Communicative Disorders and Stroke 
and the Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Disor-
ders Association.7 The exclusion criteria have been 
described previously.5,6 Unlike the EXPEDITION 
and EXPEDITION2 trials, the EXPEDITION3 trial 
included only patients with mild Alzheimer’s 
disease who had biomarker evidence of amyloid-
related disease, determined by means of either 
florbetapir positron-emission tomography (PET) 
scan or Aβ1-42 measurements in cerebrospinal 
fluid (CSF).
Patients were randomly assigned in double-
blind fashion to receive intravenous infusions of 
either solanezumab at a dose of 400 mg or pla-
cebo every 4 weeks for 76 weeks. Patients who 
completed the double-blind period could partici-
pate in an optional 24-month open-label period. 
Concomitant therapy, including treatments for 
symptoms of dementia (acetylcholinesterase in-
hibitors and memantine, alone or in combination) 
and nondrug treatments, was allowed in order 
to ensure that patients continued receiving the 
standard of care for Alzheimer’s disease. This 
article includes only the results from the double-
blind, placebo-controlled period of the trial. The 
primary objective of the trial was to test the hy-
pothesis that solanezumab would slow the cogni-
tive decline of Alzheimer’s disease, as compared 
with placebo, in patients with mild dementia 
due to Alzheimer’s disease.
Safety Assessments
Key safety assessments included routine physical 
and neurologic examinations, routine clinical 
laboratory assessment, and the collection of 
adverse-event data. Magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) was used to detect any evidence of amyloid-
related imaging abnormalities for either hemor-
rhage or hemosiderin deposition (cerebral micro-
hemorrhage or hemosiderosis) or edema or 
effusions (vasogenic edema). Adverse events that 
are associated with immunogenicity or antidrug 
antibodies were evaluated. Additional safety as-
sessments are described in the protocol, avail-
able with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.
Outcome Measures
The primary efficacy measure was the change 
from baseline to 80 weeks in the score on the 
14-item cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer’s 
Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog14; scores 
range from 0 to 90, with higher scores indicat-
ing greater cognitive impairment).8,9 Key second-

Solanezumab for Dementia Due to Alzheimer’s Disease
ary efficacy measures included scores on the fol-
lowing assessments: the MMSE10; the Alzheimer’s 
Disease Cooperative Study (ADCS) Activities of 
Daily Living Inventory (ADCS-ADL; scores range 
from 0 to 78, with lower scores indicating greater 
functional impairment); the ADCS instrumental 
subscale (ADCS-iADL), which assesses complex 
activities such as using public transportation, 
managing finances, or shopping (scores range 
from 0 to 56, with lower scores indicating 
greater functional loss)11,12; the Clinical Demen-
tia Rating Scale–Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB; scores 
range from 0 to 18, with higher scores indicating 
greater impairment)13,14; the Functional Activities 
Questionnaire (FAQ; scores range from 0 to 30, 
with higher scores indicating greater functional 
loss)15; and the Integrated Alzheimer’s Disease 
Rating Scale (iADRS; scores range from 0 to 
146, with lower scores indicating worse perfor-
mance).16 Biomarker and neuroimaging methods 
are described in the Supplementary Appendix, 
available at NEJM.org.
Oversight
The trial protocol was approved by the ethics 
and institutional review boards at all the sites. 
All the participants provided written informed 
consent before participation in the trial. The 
sponsor (Eli Lilly) designed and funded the trial, 
provided solanezumab and placebo, participated 
in writing the manuscript, and oversaw con-
tracted research organizations. The first draft of 
the manuscript was written by the first author 
and an author who was an employee of the spon-
sor. Several authors are former employees of the 
sponsor but were still employees at the time that 
the manuscript was written. All the statistical 
analyses that are reported here were performed 
by the sponsor or by a contract research organi-
zation. The statistical analysis plan is available 
with the trial protocol, and the informed-consent 
form is provided in the Supplementary Appen-
dix. All the authors attest to the fidelity of the 
trial to the protocol and to the accuracy and 
completeness of the data and analysis. All the 
authors reviewed and approved versions of the 
manuscript for submission for publication.
Statistical Analysis
Analyses were conducted on the basis of a modi-
fied intention-to-treat principle and involved only 
patients who had outcome measurements both 
at and after baseline. All the tests of effects were 
conducted at a two-sided alpha level of 0.05, un-
less otherwise specified. Patients who did not 
have a postbaseline measure were not included 
in the analyses. Additional details, including in-
formation about the weighted imputation meth-
ods for missing data, are provided in the statisti-
cal analysis plan (see the protocol).
Randomization of the patients was stratified 
according to site and according to the method 
that was used to determine the presence of 
amyloid-related disease (florbetapir PET scan 
or CSF assessment). Fisher’s exact test or Pearson’s 
chi-square test was used for trial-group compari-
sons of categorical data; analysis of variance, 
with independent factors for treatment and site, 
was used for continuous data.
The primary outcome, the change from base-
line to 80 weeks in the ADAS-cog14 score, was 
analyzed with the use of a mixed-model repeated-
measures analysis, with the change from base-
line in the ADAS-cog14 score at each scheduled 
visit at weeks 12, 28, 40, 52, 64, and 80 after 
baseline as the dependent variable. The model 
for the fixed effects included terms for seven 
effects: the baseline ADAS-cog14 score, site, trial 
group, visit, trial group–by–visit interaction, con-
comitant use of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors 
or memantine (or both) at baseline (yes or no), 
and age at baseline. Visits were considered to be 
a categorical variable, with values equal to the 
visit number at which the scales were assessed.
Each secondary efficacy outcome was assessed 
with the use of a mixed model with a repeated-
measures analysis in the following hierarchical 
order: ADCS-iADL, MMSE, and FAQ. The CDR-SB 
score was assessed only at baseline and at the 
final study visit, so the change in the CDR-SB 
score was examined with the use of an analysis 
of covariance model that contained terms for 
baseline score, site, trial group, concomitant use 
of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors or memantine 
(or both) at baseline (yes or no), and age at base-
line. The failure, at a two-sided P value of 0.05, 
of any analysis in the hierarchy would prevent 
the reporting of significance testing for all the 
items after the point of failure.
Safety was assessed by the summary and analy-
sis of clinical laboratory results, adverse events, 
MRI scans, electrocardiograms, and immuno-
genicity results. Safety analyses for the double-
blind period used comparisons between the

solanezumab group and the placebo group. No 
adjustments for multiple comparisons were made. 
Analyses comparing the proportion of patients 
with abnormalities between trial groups during 
the double-blind period included only patients 
with both a baseline and a postbaseline observa-
tion for each variable. An independent data and 
safety monitoring committee met periodically to 
monitor accruing safety data. No interim efficacy 
analyses were conducted. Statistical methods 
that were used for biomarker and neuroimaging 
assessments are provided in the Supplementary 
Appendix.
Results
Trial Population
Of 4101 patients who underwent screening, 2129 
underwent randomization between August 12, 
2013, and October 13, 2016; a total of 1822 pa-
tients (86.5% of the patients in the solanezumab 
group and 84.7% of those in the placebo group) 
completed the trial (Fig. 1). There were 210 sites 
in 11 countries, with each site contributing 1 to 
30 patients. There were no significant between-
group differences in the baseline characteristics 
of the patients with respect to age, sex, race, 
education, or apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 carrier 
status. The mean (±SD) ADAS-cog14 score at 
baseline was 28.9±8.3 in the solanezumab group, 
as compared with 29.7±8.5 in the placebo group 
(P 
= 
0.02), and the mean MMSE score at the be-
ginning of the trial was 22.8±2.8 and 22.6±2.9, 
respectively (P 
= 
0.12) Additional demographic char-
acteristics of the patients are listed in Table 1.
Outcomes
The results of the primary-outcome measure (the 
ADAS-cog14) were analyzed as the change from 
baseline over time (Fig. 2A). There was no sig-
nificant between-group difference at week 80 in 
the change in score from baseline (change, 6.65 
in the solanezumab group and 7.44 in the placebo 
group; difference, −0.80; P 
= 
0.10) (Table 2).
As a result of the failure to reach significance 
regarding the primary outcome in the prespeci-
fied hierarchical analysis, the secondary outcomes 
were considered to be descriptive and are report-
ed (as point estimates with confidence intervals) 
without significance testing. There was a decrease 
(indicating worsening) in the score on the MMSE, 
the ADCS-iADL (Fig. 2B), the ADCS-ADL, and 
the iADRS in the two trial groups and an increase 
(indicating worsening) in the score on the FAQ 
Figure 1. Enrollment, Randomization, and Trial Completion.
There were no significant between-group differences in the reasons for discontinuation. In the placebo group, one additional patient 
died after completion of the double-blind period and was included in the safety analyses.

and CDR-SB (Table 2). The raw values, the mean 
changes at week 80, between-group differences, 
and 95% confidence intervals for the secondary 
outcomes are shown in Table 2. The main re-
sults of the biomarker and neuroimaging assess-
ments are provided in the Supplementary Appen-
dix. Details of these biologic secondary outcomes 
have not been fully analyzed.
Adverse Events
A total of 891 of 1054 patients (84.5%) in the 
solanezumab group and 890 of 1067 (83.4%) in 
the placebo group had at least one adverse event 
during the double-blind period in the safety 
population. Four categories of events occurred 
significantly more frequently in the solanezumab 
group: vitamin D deficiency, nasal congestion, 
spinal osteoarthritis, and dysuria; and two cate-
gories occurred more frequently in the placebo 
group: gait disturbance and somnolence. Table 
S1 in the Supplementary Appendix lists the ad-
verse events that occurred in 2% or more of the 
patients during the double-blind period.
In the population of patients who had under-
gone randomization, 48 of 1057 patients (4.5%) 
in the solanezumab group and 39 of 1072 (3.6%) 
in the placebo group had an adverse event that 
led to discontinuation of the trial. There were no 
significant between-group differences in the 
numbers of patients who had a serious adverse

event and those who died. A total of 175 of 1054 
patients (16.6%) in the solanezumab group had 
at least one serious adverse event, as did 202 of 
1067 (18.9%) in the placebo group. A total of 
112 patients (10.6%) in the solanezumab group 
and 105 (9.8%) in the placebo group were hos-
pitalized during the trial. There were 9 deaths 
(0.9%) among patients receiving solanezumab 
and 17 (1.6%) among those receiving placebo. 
Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix lists 
the serious adverse events that occurred in 0.5% 
or more of the patients.
At baseline, before exposure to the trial regi-
men, 80 of 1034 patients (7.7%) in the solanezu-
mab group and 73 of 1048 (7.0%) in the placebo 
group had antidrug antibodies. Antidrug anti-
bodies occurred after baseline during the double-
blind period in 33 patients (3.2%) in the solanezu-
mab group and in 41 (3.9%) in the placebo 
group (P 
= 
0.41). Neutralizing antibodies were 
present in 4 patients (0.4%) in the solanezumab 
group and in 6 (0.6%) in the placebo group. 
Events that were considered to be potentially 
related to hypersensitivity were observed in 8 pa-
tients with antidrug antibodies in the solanezu-
mab group and in 15 in the placebo group.
There was one case of amyloid-related abnor-
mality of edema or effusions on cerebral imaging 
in the solanezumab group and two cases in the 
placebo group. The three patients with amyloid-
related abnormalities of edema or effusions on 
imaging were asymptomatic during the placebo-
controlled phase of the trial. There were no sig-
nificant differences between groups in amyloid-
related abnormalities on imaging with regard to 
hemorrhage or hemosiderin deposition.
Discussion
This phase 3 trial of solanezumab administered 
intravenously at a dose of 400 mg in patients 
with mild Alzheimer’s disease did not show a 
significant benefit, as compared with placebo, 
in reducing cognitive decline as measured by the 
ADAS-cog14 at 80 weeks (primary outcome). Sig-
nificance testing of the secondary cognitive and 
functional measures was not reported because 
of failure of the primary outcome in the hierar-
chical analysis. The results of this trial may be 
compared with those of earlier phase 3 trials of 
solanezumab that involved patients with more 
advanced disease. Among a limited number of 
patients who consented to undergo amyloid PET 
or have CSF assessments in substudies of the 
EXPEDITION and EXPEDITION2 trials, approxi-
mately 25% of the patients with mild Alzheimer’s 
disease did not have evidence of amyloid-related 
disease.6 These patients would not have been ex-
pected to have a response to a treatment target-

ing Aβ. The inclusion in the current trial of only 
patients with mild Alzheimer’s disease and evi-
dence of amyloid burden was expected to pro-
duce treatment outcomes of at least the same 
magnitude or greater as those seen in the previ-
ous trials. The treatment effect in the current 
trial on the rate of cognitive decline was smaller 
than that observed in the secondary analyses of 
the population of patients with mild Alzheimer’s 
disease in the two previous studies.6 The reason 
for the smaller clinical effects is unclear.
There were no significant differences between 
the solanezumab group and the placebo group 
with regard to serious adverse events. Concerns 
about potential cardiac effects of solanezumab 
arose in the previous phase 3 studies6 but did 
not do so in the current trial. Adverse events that 
are associated with amyloid-related imaging ab-
normalities of edema or effusions and hemor-
rhage or hemosiderin deposition that occurred 
with other monoclonal antibodies that directly 
target amyloid plaques17-20 were observed in only 
one participant receiving solanezumab in the cur-
rent trial. The low incidence of adverse amyloid-
related imaging abnormalities associated with 
solanezumab is consistent with the reported 
occurrence of imaging changes that are seen in 
the placebo groups of other clinical trials.21 
Therefore, it is possible that the low incidence of 
adverse amyloid-related imaging abnormalities 
associated with solanezumab administration may 
reflect the binding only to soluble Aβ, but there 
is no direct evidence to support this hypothesis.
The percentages of patients who have the 
APOE ε4 allele were higher in the EXPEDITION3 
trial (69.3% in the solanezumab group and 66.3% 
in the placebo group) than in the EXPEDITION 
and EXPEDITION2 trials (57.6% overall),6 a find-
ing that is likely to be due to the entry require-
ment for evidence of markers of amyloid-related 
disease. The completion rate of 85.6% in the 
current trial was high, with limited early with-
drawals from the trial, given that 20 intravenous 
infusions were required per the protocol over an 
18-month period.
There are several possible reasons why the 
administered dose of solanezumab did not reduce 
cognitive decline. First, the observed peripheral 
reductions in soluble free Aβ concentrations 
may not have been sufficient to reduce deposited 
cerebral amyloid, neuronal atrophy, or the patho-
biologic events that lead to clinical decline. The 
so-called peripheral sink hypothesis posits that 
reducing the free (unbound) fraction of Aβ in 
plasma would lead to the increased clearance of 
Aβ from the brain.22 The solanezumab dose that 
was administered in this trial was associated with 
a high level of peripheral target engagement, 
sufficient to reduce free plasma Aβ concentra-
tions by more than 90% (Fig. S1 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix). However, this effect did not 
produce clinical efficacy. Thus, a reduction in 
peripheral free Aβ alone is unlikely to lead to 
clinically meaningful cognitive benefits.
Second, the dose of solanezumab (400 mg, 
administered every 4 weeks) may have been insuf-
ficient to produce a meaningful effect. Solanezu-
mab penetration into the central nervous system 
(CNS), as measured by cerebrospinal fluid con-
centrations, is only approximately 0.1 to 0.3% of 
the concentration measured in plasma. The re-
sultant penetration of CNS antibody in the brain 
may have been too low to neutralize enough in-
terstitial fluid Aβ to produce a clinically mean-
ingful effect at this dose. The administered dose 
of solanezumab did not reduce the burden of 
fibrillar amyloid, as assessed by means of flor-
betapir PET imaging. A lack of an effect on pre-
existing amyloid plaques in this trial is consistent 
with the results from earlier clinical data and 
nonclinical studies in animals.23 Antibodies that 
bind soluble Aβ would be expected to have only 
marginal effects on preexisting amyloid. Dose–
response studies that have been performed with 
other antibodies that, unlike solanezumab, are 
directed against deposited amyloid (a mechanism 
dependent on antibody penetration into the CNS) 
have shown dose-proportional effects on plaque 
clearance and possible slowing of clinical de-
cline.20 Studies with these plaque-targeting anti-
bodies have also shown dose-dependent in-
creases in the incidence of CNS-associated adverse 
events.17,20
Third, the pathological changes in the mild 
stage of Alzheimer’s disease–related dementia 
may not be amenable to treatment with a drug 
targeting soluble Aβ. Some data from mouse 
models suggest that neurodegeneration in Alz-
heimer’s disease may reach a point at which it 
becomes self-propagating24 and not susceptible 
to intervention. However, it is unclear whether 
this finding is applicable to human disease or at

Solanezumab for Dementia Due to Alzheimer’s Disease
what stage it might pertain. Data from ongoing 
clinical trials involving patients at earlier stages 
of the continuum of Alzheimer’s disease, such 
as the Anti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic 
Alzheimer’s (A4) trial (ClinicalTrials.gov number, 
NCT02008357) and the Dominantly Inherited Alz-
heimer Network Trial (DIAN-TU; NCT01760005), 
may address this question.
Fourth, solanezumab was designed to increase 
the clearance of soluble Aβ from the brain, pred-
icated on the Aβ hypothesis of Alzheimer’s dis-
ease — that the disease results from the over-
production of or reduced clearance of Aβ (or 
both). Although the amyloid hypothesis is based 
on considerable genetic and biomarker data,25 if 
amyloid is not the cause of the disease, solanezu-
mab would not be expected to slow disease pro-
gression.26,27 A single study ought not to be 
viewed as disproving a hypothesis; nevertheless, 
the amyloid hypothesis will need to be consid-
ered in the context of accruing results from this 
trial and other clinical trials of antiamyloid 
therapies.
In conclusion, in patients with mild Alzheimer’s 
disease, the results of the EXPEDITION3 trial 
showed no benefit of solanezumab on the primary 
outcome of cognitive decline and did not repro-
duce the secondary analyses of the EXPEDITION 
and EXPEDITION2 trials. The rationale for fur-
ther trials with solanezumab with different doses 
and timing may require examination.
