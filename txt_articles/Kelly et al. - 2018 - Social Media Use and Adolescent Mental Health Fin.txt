Background: Evidence suggests social media use is associated with mental health in young people but underlying
processes are not well understood. This paper i) assesses whether social media use is associated with adolescents'
depressive symptoms, and ii) investigates multiple potential explanatory pathways via online harassment, sleep,
self-esteem and body image.
Methods: We used population based data from the UK Millennium Cohort Study on 10,904 14 year olds. Multivar-
iate regression and path models were used to examine associations between social media use and depressive
symptoms.
Findings: The magnitude of association between social media use and depressive symptoms was larger for girls
than for boys. Compared with 1–3 h of daily use: 3 to b5 h 26% increase in scores vs 21%; ≥5 h 50% vs 35% for
girls and boys respectively. Greater social media use related to online harassment, poor sleep, low self-esteem
and poor body image; in turn these related to higher depressive symptom scores. Multiple potential intervening
pathways were apparent, for example: greater hours social media use related to body weight dissatisfaction
(≥5 h 31% more likely to be dissatisfied), which in turn linked to depressive symptom scores directly (body dis-
satisfaction 15% higher depressive symptom scores) and indirectly via self-esteem.
Interpretation: Our findings highlight the potential pitfalls of lengthy social media use for young people's mental
health. Findings are highly relevant for the development of guidelines for the safe use of social media and calls on
industry to more tightly regulate hours of social media use.

1. Introduction
Youth mental health is a major public health concern which poses
substantial societal and economic burdens globally [1,2]. Adolescence
is a period of vulnerability for the development of depression [3] and
young people with mental health problems are at higher risk of poor
mental health throughout their lives [4]. Therefore, intervening early
could have long-term knock on benefits for population health. Social
media use, a relatively recent phenomena, has become the primary
form of communication for young people in the UK and elsewhere [5,
6]. Undoubtedly, using social media can be beneficial including as a
source of social support and knowledge acquisition, however, a mount-
ing body of evidence suggests associations with poor mental health
among young people [7,8]. Moreover, a recent report using longitudinal
data suggests that girls may be more affected than boys [9]. Amid the
public debate on the pros and cons of social media use taking place in
the UK and elsewhere, the British Secretary of State for Health has
joined recent calls for social media organisations to regulate use more
tightly [10,11] and an investigation by the Chief Medical Officer into
the links between social media use and young people's mental health
is underway.
Numerous plausible potential intervening pathways relate young
people's mental health to the amount of time they spend on social net-
working sites, and the ways in which they engage and interact online.
Widely researched are pathways via experiences of online harassment,
as victim and/or perpetrator, which have the potential to impact on
young people's mental health due to the ease of sharing of materials
that damage reputations and relationships [12–14]. It is commonplace
for young people to sleep in close proximity to their phones [15] and
sleep has been shown to be linked to mental health [16,17]. Social
media use could impact on young people's sleep in multiple ways, for
instance spending a long time on social media might lead to reduced
sleep duration, whilst incoming alerts in the night and fear of missing
out on new content could cause sleep disruptions [18–20]. Screen expo-
sure before bedtime and the consequent impact of this on melatonin

 production and the circadian rhythm are also possible mechanisms [21].
Sleep quality and quantity could also be affected by levels of anxiety and
worry resulting from experiences of online harassment. Young people
are particularly vulnerable to the development of low self-esteem [22]
and this could be exacerbated by online experiences including receipt
of negative feedback and negative social comparisons [23,24]. The abun-
dance of manipulated images of idealised ‘beauty’ online are linked to
individual perceptions of body image and self-esteem which in turn
are associated with poor mental health [25,26]. It is also important to ac-
knowledge that a cyclical relationship between social media use and
mental health could be at play, whereby young people experiencing
poor mental health might be more likely to use social media for ex-
tended periods of time. However, to our knowledge, prior research
has not examined all these potential explanatory pathways between so-
cial media use and mental health at the same time, and in an attempt to
improve understanding of the mechanisms at play, in this paper we
simultaneously examine multiple potential pathways between social
media use and a marker of young people's mental health. We
hypothesise, net of prior mental health, that: i) the relationship be-
tween social media use and depressive symptoms would be partially
mediated through poor sleep, online harassment, poor self-esteem
and body image; ii) the association of online harassment with depres-
sive symptoms would be partially mediated by poorer sleep, poor
body image and poor self-esteem; and iii) the poor body image relation-
ship with depressive symptoms would be partially mediated by poor
self-esteem (Fig. 1).
We use data from a large representative population-based cohort
study of adolescents, the Millennium Cohort Study. Given potential gen-
der differences in associations, we explore among girls and boys, the fol-
lowing objectives: 1. To assess whether social media use is associated
with depressive symptoms in adolescents, and 2. To investigate poten-
tial explanatory pathways for observed associations – via online harass-
ment, sleep, self-esteem and body image.
2. Methods
The Millennium Cohort Study (MCS) is a UK nationally representa-
tive prospective cohort study of children born into 19,244 families be-
tween September 2000 and January 2002 (http://www.cls.ioe.ac.uk/
shared/get-file.ashx?id=1806&itemtype=document). Participating
families in receipt of Child Benefit (98% of the population at the time
of sampling) were selected from a random sample of electoral wards
with a stratified sampling design to ensure adequate representation
of all four UK countries, disadvantaged and ethnically diverse areas.
The first sweep of data was collected when cohort members were
around 9 months and the subsequent five sweeps of data were col-
lected at ages 3, 5, 7, 11 and 14 years. At age 14 cohort members
and their carers were interviewed during home visits. Cohort mem-
bers self-completed computer assisted questionnaires in private in-
cluding items about social media use, mental health, online
harassment, sleep, self-esteem and body image. Carers (the majority
of whom were cohort members' parents and for ease throughout are
referred to as parents) answered questions about socioeconomic cir-
cumstances and cohort member's social and emotional difficulties at
age 11. Interview data were available for 61% of families when cohort
members were aged 14 [27].
2.1. Depressive Symptoms
Participants completed the Mood and Feelings Questionnaire – short
version (SMFQ) from which a summed score was created [28]. The
SMFQ comprises 13 items on affective symptoms in the last 2 weeks
(see Box 1). In supplementary analysis we derived a binary variable to
capture the presence of clinically relevant symptoms using a cut point
of ≥12 [29].
2.2. Social media use
Respondents were asked about their average hours of social media
use on a weekday (for details of response categories see Box 1). The
item used was developed by the Millennium Cohort Study team and is
similar to items used in other large surveys including the UK Household
Longitudinal Study [9] and Ofcom [5]. The social media measure was not
used as a continuous variable due to heteroscedasticity. We generated a
variable as follows: none, b1 h, 1 to b3 h, 3 to b5 h, ≥5 h. 1–3 h was the
most prevalent category and is used as the reference category in multi-
variate modelling.
Questionnaire items on online harassment, sleep, self-esteem
(Rosenberg scale [30]) and body image are detailed in Box 1.
The online harassment measure was treated as a categorical var-
iable due to distributional patterns. A binary variable for self-esteem
was used because of non-normal distribution for which no
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We systematically reviewed MEDLINE for studies about social
media use and mental health in adolescents published in English
between database inception and May 30, 2018, using the follow-
ing search terms: “social media”, “adolescent”, “cyberbullying”,
“mental health”, “self-esteem”, “sleep” and “body image”. Studies
suggest social media use is associated with mental health in
young people; several identified plausible potential explanations
for links between social media use and mental health, include ex-
periences of online harassment, effects on sleep, self-esteem and
body image. To our knowledge no prior studies have examined
all these potential explanations simultaneously.
Added value of this study
Using large scale data generalisable to the wider population on
more than 10,000 14 year olds, we examined multiple pathways
simultaneously finding: for girls across the range of daily social
media use, from none to 5 or more hours, a strong stepwise in-
crease in depressive symptom scores and the proportion with
clinically relevant symptoms; for boys, higher depressive symp-
tom scores were seen among those reporting 3 or more hours
daily use; for boys and girls, greater social media use related to
poor sleep, poor body image, experience of online harassment
and low self-esteem, all of which in turn related directly to de-
pressive symptoms. Multiple intervening pathways between so-
cial media use and depressive symptoms were apparent. The
most important pathways were via poor sleep and online harass-
ment. For example: more social media use linked to poor sleep
which in turn was related to depressive symptoms; experiencing
online harassment was linked to poor sleep, poor body image and
low self-esteem; and that girls and boys with poor body image
were more likely to have low self-esteem.
Implications of all the available evidence
Poor sleep, online harassment, poor body image and low self-
esteem appear important pathways via which social media use is
associated with depressive symptoms in young people. Findings
are highly relevant for the development of guidelines for the
safe use of social media and calls on industry to more tightly reg-
ulate hours of social media use.

 transformation was satisfactory, and the raw data showed significant
heteroscedasticity.
2.3. Confounders
In line with prior research [9] we controlled for the following con-
founders in our analyses: family income – equivalised fifths; family
structure (two vs one parent); and age in years. In an attempt to take ac-
count of the potentially cyclical association between social media use
and depressed mood we controlled for internalising symptoms (contin-
uous scale, derived from the parent completed Strengths and
Difficulties Questionnaire) [31] from earlier in adolescence when par-
ticipants were aged 11.
2.4. Study Sample
We analysed data on singleton-born cohort members for whom data
on depressive symptoms were available. The analytical sample was
10,904 after multiply imputing missing values on explanatory factors
due to item non-response, with the amount of missing covariate data
ranging from 0% to 8%. We employed multiple imputation which ac-
counts for uncertainty about missing values by imputing several values

Depressive symptoms
Participants completed the Mood and Feelings Questionnaire – short
version (SMFQ) from which a summed score was created. The SMFQ
comprises 13 items on affective symptoms in the last 2 weeks as
follows: felt miserable or unhappy; didn't enjoy anything at all; so
tired just sat around and did nothing; was very restless; felt I was no
good anymore; cried a lot; found it hard to think properly or
concentrate; hated myself; was a bad person; felt lonely; thought
nobody really loved me; thought I could never be as good as other
kids; did everything wrong.
Log transformed continuous variable used in
modelling; generated dichotomous variable
indicating clinically relevant symptoms (cut
point ≥ 12)
Social media usea
Respondents were asked “On a normal week day during term time,
how many hours do you spend on social networking or messaging
sites or Apps on the internet such as Facebook, Twitter and
WhatsApp?” (response categories: None, less than half an hour, half
an hour to less than 1 h, 1 h to less than 2 h, 2 h to less than 3 h, 3 h
to less than 5 h, 5 h to less than 7 h, 7 h or more).
Categories were collapsed to generate a
variable as follows: none, b1 h, 1 to b3 h, 3
to b5 h, ≥5 h.

Combined responses capturing any
involvement as victim and/or perpetrator to
generate a variable with 4 categories: no
involvement; victim; perpetrator;
perpetrator-victim. (Adapted from Fahy et al
[12])
Sleep duration
“About what time do you usually go to sleep on a school night?”
“About what time do you usually wake up in the morning on a school
day?”.
A 4-category variable was generated: 7 h or
less, 8, 9, 10+ h
Sleep latency
A sleep latency variable was constructed from answers to the
question “During the last four weeks, how long did it usually take for
you to fall asleep?”
A 3-category variable was created: 0–30,
30–60, N60mins.
Sleep disruption
Disruptions to sleep were assessed using the question “During the
last four weeks, how often did you awaken during your sleep time
and have trouble falling back to sleep again?”
A 4-category variable was created: all/most
of the time; often; a little of the time; and
none of the time.
Self-esteem c
Self-esteem was assessed using the items on self-satisfaction from
the Rosenberg scale: having good qualities; able to do things similar
to others; person of value; and feel good about oneself.
A dichotomised variable (low vs normal/high)
derived from the sum of the items, scores ≥ 7
(i.e. the top 20% of the distribution) indicate
low self-esteem.
Happiness with
appearance
Happiness with appearance was measured, as follows: “On a scale of
1 to 7 where ‘1’ means completely happy and ‘7’ means not at all
happy, how do you feel about the way you look?”
A log transformed continuous variable was
used in modelling. A dichotomised variable
(1–6 vs 7) was used for display purposes in
Tables 1 & 2.
Body weight
satisfaction
Body weight satisfaction was assessed from 3 items: “Which of these
do you think you are?” (underweight, about the right weight, slightly
overweight, very overweight), “Have you ever exercised to lose weight
or to avoid gaining weight?”, “Have you ever eaten less food, fewer
calories, or foods low in fat to lose weight or to avoid gaining weight?”.
Responses other than ‘about the right weight’
or affirmative to exercising or eating to lose or
maintain weight were combined to generate a
body satisfaction variable (satisfied vs
dissatisfied).
a Alternative specifications that assumed a continuous normal distribution were rejected due to heteroscedasticity.
b Treating the online harassment victim and -perpetrator variables as ordinal and testing for an interaction between the two variables resulted in an unwieldy number of parameters.
Assuming the variables to be continuous was not tenable due to their distributional patterns.
c The Rosenberg Scale had a distinctly non-normal distribution for which no transformation was satisfactory. Regression models using the raw scale show significant heteroscedasticity.

 for each missing data point [32]. We imputed 20 data sets, and report
consolidated results from all imputations using Rubin's combination
rules [33]. Results from the imputed analyses did not vary substantively
from the analyses using listwise deletion (analysis not shown).
2.5. Statistical Analysis
To examine whether and by how much associations between social
media use and depressive symptoms were explained by markers of on-
line harassment, sleep, self-esteem and body image we ran multivari-
able linear regression models, adding and removing variables in
separate blocks of adjustment, as follows:
Model 0 – social media use plus confounders (family income, family
structure, age, internalising symptoms at age 11)
Model 1 – M0 plus online harassment
Model 2 – M0 plus sleep quantity and quality (sleep hours, latency
and disruption)
Model 3 – M0 plus self-esteem
Model 4 – M0 plus body image (happy with appearance and body
weight satisfaction)
The potential a priori moderating effect of gender on the social
media use and depressive symptoms relationship was tested for
(using Wald t-tests) by adding in a gender by social media use interac-
tion term to Model 0 (p b 0.05). The regression model findings are
therefore presented for girls and boys separately. Wald tests assessed
the a priori role of online harassment, sleep, self-esteem and body
image as mediators between social media use and log depressive symp-
toms, by showing the significance of social media use before (Model
0) and after their introduction (Models 1–4).
In supplementary analysis, to assess consistency of findings, we ran
logistic regression models using a binary indicator for clinically relevant
symptoms.
Path models were then estimated to quantify the hypothesised ex-
planatory pathways between social media use and mental health (see
Fig. 1). A first model allowed all paths to differ by gender. Wald tests
then assessed the statistical significance of any differences, after
Bonferroni adjustment to account for the 75 tests. In the second
model, all non-significantly different paths were constrained to be
equal across gender.
The path models were estimated using the generalised structural
equation model, GSEM command in Stata, which allows for the contin-
uous, binary, categorical and ordered measures to be modelled using
linear, logistic, multinomial and ordinal logistic specifications,
respectively.
All analyses were carried out using Stata version 15.1 (Stata Corp).
Survey weights were applied throughout to take account of the unequal
probability of being sampled.
3. Role of the Funding Source
The study was funded by the Economic and Social Research Council
(ES/R008930/1). The funder had no role in the study design; in the col-
lection, analysis, and interpretation of data; or in the writing of the re-
port; or in the decision to submit the article for publication. The
corresponding author had full access to all intermediate outputs, with
the study statisticians (AZ and AS) having access to the full study
datasets. All authors had final responsibility for the decision to submit
for publication.
4. Results
The average age of participants was 14.3 (SD 0.34) years. Girls re-
ported more hours of social media use than did boys. Over two fifths
of girls used social media for 3 or more hours per day compared with
one fifth of boys (43.1% vs 21.9% respectively), and only 4% of girls re-
ported not using social media compared to 10% of boys (Table 1). Com-
pared with boys, girls were more likely to be involved in online
harassment as a victim or perpetrator (38.7% vs 25.1% respectively).
Girls were more likely to have low self-esteem (12.8% vs 8.9%), to
have body weight dissatisfaction (78.2% vs 68.3%) and to be unhappy
with their appearance (15.4% vs 11.8%). Girls were more likely to report
fewer hours of sleep compared with boys (b7 h 13.4% vs 10.8%) and to
report experiencing disrupted sleep often (27.6% vs 20.2%) or most of
the time (12.7% vs 7.4%) but were similar in reporting how long it
took them to fall asleep (Table 1).
Social media use was associated with experiences of online harass-
ment, short sleep hours, the time it takes to fall asleep, sleep disruption,
being happy with appearance and body weight satisfaction among girls

 and boys. Girls and boys living in lower income and one parent
households were more likely to use social media for 5 or more hours
daily. Having high internalising symptom scores at age 11 was associ-
ated with higher prevalences of not using social media (girls 7.0 vs
3.5%; boys 15.5 vs 8.5%). Girls with high internalising symptom scores
also had a higher prevalence of social media use for 5 or more hours
per day (Table 1).
On average girls had higher depressive symptom scores compared
with boys (geometric mean score 4.6 vs 2.5). Online harassment, sleep
hours, latency and disruption, self-esteem happiness with appearance
and body weight satisfaction were all strongly associated with depres-
sive symptom scores as were internalising symptoms from earlier in ad-
olescence for girls and boys (Table 2).
4.1. Is Social Media Use Associated With Depressive Symptoms in
Adolescence?
The association between social media use and means of log depres-
sive symptoms was stronger for girls compared with boys (test for
interaction, p b 0.001). Among girls, greater daily hours of social
media use corresponded to a stepwise increase in depressive symptom
scores and in the proportion with clinically relevant symptoms. For
boys, higher depressive symptom scores were seen among those
reporting 3 or more hours of daily social media use (Table 2).
In regression models (Table 3) Wald tests confirmed that the magni-
tude of association between social media use and depressive symptoms
scores was larger for girls than for boys. In model 0 with 1 to b3 h as the
reference category: for girls and boys using social media for 3 to b5 h
there were 26% vs 21% higher depressive symptoms scores; and for
girls and boys with ≥5 h use there were 50% vs 35% higher scores
respectively.
4.2. Are Online Harassment, Sleep, Self-esteem and Body Image Potential
Mediators of the Association Between Social Media Use and Depressive
Symptoms?
In multivariate models, adjusting for markers of online harassment,
sleep, self-esteem and body image reduced coefficients for associations

 between social media use and depressive symptom suggesting some
mediation (Table 3). Wald tests assess the null hypothesis that the 4 pa-
rameters for social media use are simultaneously equal to zero, indica-
tive of full mediation. They confirmed rejection of the null hypothesis;
social media use appeared to be partially mediated in models 1–4. Tak-
ing each of these hypothesised pathways in turn with 1 to b3 h of daily
use as the reference category, we see that adjustment for online harass-
ment (Model 1) attenuates the association between social media use
and depressive symptoms for girls and boys. For 3 to b5 h there were
17% and 16% higher scores for girls and boys; and for ≥5 h there were
30% and 27% higher scores respectively. Similarly, adjustment for
markers of sleep (Model 2) reduced depressive symptom score coeffi-
cients for girls and boys. For 3 to b5 h there was a 18% and 15% change;
and for ≥5 h 28% and 21% change for girls and boys respectively. Adjust-
ment for the marker of self-esteem (Model 3) attenuated associations
more for girls than for boys. For 3 to b5 h there was a 20% and 18%
change; and for ≥5 h a 26% and 31% change for girls and boys respec-
tively. Adjusting for markers of body image (Model 4) reduced coeffi-
cients for girls and boys. For 3 to b5 h there was a 17% change; and a
30% for ≥5 h for both genders. A similar pattern of findings was observed
when we considered clinically relevant depressive symptoms as the
outcome variable (data available on request).
4.3. What are the Potential Pathways From Social Media Use to Depressive
Symptom Scores?
The first path model (not shown) found consistent associations for
girls and boys, none of the associations reached the criterion for gender
differences. The second model estimated common pathways for girls
and boys; Fig. 2 gives a graphical indication of the overall strength of
the pathways while Table 4 provides detailed estimates. Support was
found for all the hypothesised pathways. In Fig. 2, the width of an
arrow indicates the strength of support for that pathway. The most im-
portant routes from social media use to depressive symptoms are
shown to be via poor sleep and online harassment. There was a simple
pathway from social media use to depressive symptoms via poor
sleep. The role of online harassment was more complex, with multiple
pathways through poor sleep, self-esteem and body image.
In more detail (Table 4), greater social media use was related to less
sleep, taking more time to fall asleep and more disruptions. For exam-
ple, ≥5 h using social media was associated with ≈50% lower odds of
1 h more sleep. In turn, depressive symptom scores were higher for
girls and boys experiencing poor sleep (≤7 h associated with 19% (exp
0.17) higher scores than 9 h sleep). Both ≥5 h on social media and no so-
cial media use were related to low self-esteem (56% and 75% respec-
tively, vs. 1 to b3 h). In turn, self-esteem strongly predicted higher
depressive symptom scores (75% higher). More hours using social
media was related to body weight dissatisfaction and unhappiness
with appearance (≥5 h 31% more likely to be dissatisfied and 8% higher
unhappiness with appearance scores than 1 to b3 h). In turn, body
image was linked to depressive symptom scores both directly (body dis-
satisfaction 15% higher depressive symptom scores and 10% greater un-
happiness with appearance scores with 5% (1.100.47) higher depressive
symptom scores) and indirectly via poor self-esteem. Finally, social
media use was related to involvement with online harassment (≥5 h
victim odds ratio 1.64; perpetrator 2.71; perpetrator-victim 2.69)
which had direct and indirect associations (via sleep, poor body image
and self-esteem) with depressive symptom scores. There was still an

5. Discussion
Among 14-year olds living in the UK, we found an association be-
tween social media use and depressive symptoms and that this was
stronger for girls than for boys. The magnitude of these associations re-
duced when potential explanatory factors were taken into account, sug-
gesting that experiences of online harassment, poorer sleep quantity
and quality, self-esteem and body image largely explain observed asso-
ciations. There was no evidence of differences for girls and boys in
hypothesised pathways between social media use and depressive
symptoms. Findings are based largely on cross sectional data and thus
causality cannot be inferred.
Consistent with other studies we found an association between so-
cial media use and depressive symptoms – a finding that has been rep-
licated using several cross sectional and longitudinal data sources [7,8].
Our finding of gender differences in the magnitude of association be-
tween social media use and depressive symptoms is consistent with
our previous research using prospective data from the UK Household
Longitudinal Study [9] which showed that girls with greater social
media use at the start of adolescence had poorer mental wellbeing sev-
eral years on. However, our prior work did not look at potential path-
ways between social media use and wellbeing, and in the current
study we did not find evidence to suggest differences for girls and
boys in the pathways at play. Our findings are consistent with prior re-
search which has typically investigated one or two potential mecha-
nisms at a time, for instance online harassment [12–14], sleep
[18–20], self-esteem [22] and body image [24,25]. We found support
for hypothesised mechanisms whereby social media use was associated
with poor sleep, involvement with online harassment, low self-esteem
and poor body image, which in turn were all related to depressive
symptoms. Moreover, we found support for our hypotheses linking
pathways – specifically adolescents experiencing online harassment
were more likely to have poor sleep, poor body image and low self-
esteem; and that girls and boys with poor body image were more likely
to have low self-esteem. However, caution is needed when interpreting
our findings as the data used in this paper were, for the most part, cross
sectional and the direction of association and therefore causality cannot
be inferred.
Our study has distinct strengths - firstly, we used data from a large
scale representative contemporary UK setting making our findings
generalisable to the wider population. Secondly, we were able to simul-
taneously investigate four hypothesised mechanisms – experiences of
online harassment, sleep quantity and quality, self-esteem and body
image – which have been proposed as pathways between social
media use and mental health in young people. To our knowledge, this
is the first paper to have investigated multiple potential pathways in
this way. Even though our findings are based largely on cross sectional
data, in path modelling we were able to explicitly test hypothesised
causal mechanisms adding weight to our findings. On the other hand,
in addition to cross sectionality, our study has distinct limitations. Due
to data availability we were not able to take account of some factors
hypothesised to be on the pathway between social media use and
poor mental health. For instance, research from elsewhere has
characterised types of social media use – active use being associated
with positive outcomes versus passive use which tends to be correlated
with negative outcomes [8]. We were not able to investigate the role of
level of emotional investment in time spent online and young people's
experiences of ‘fear of missing out’. Nor were we able to take account
of the time of day young people were online, night time use of screens
being linked to disrupted sleep patterns [21]. There is the distinct possi-
bility of a cyclical relationship between social media use and depressive
symptoms. In an attempt to deal with this in our modelling we took ac-
count of problems related to depressed mood from earlier in adoles-
cence to try and rule out the possibility that 11-year olds with more
negative affect would be lighter or heavier users of social media later
on in adolescence. We found that girls with higher internalising symp-
toms earlier in adolescence tended to either be non-users or particularly
heavy users of social media whilst boys with negative affect earlier in
adolescence were likely to be non-users thus underlining the likely
complex patterns at play and the importance of taking these data into
account in our analyses. There is a risk that self-reported data of time
spent on social media use might lack accuracy, use may be especially
difficult for young people to estimate in time categories as social
media is not clearly delineated, unlike other forms of screen based
media (including TV viewing and playing games). However, the ques-
tions used were similar to those from other large-scale population
based surveys including the UK Household Longitudinal Study [9] and
Ofcom [5]. Furthermore, the estimates of time spent using social
media presented in our paper are consistent with those reported from
other UK studies [9,34]. Similarly, self-reported sleep measures may
be prone to bias, but these have previously been shown to reliably cap-
ture sleep patterns in large scale surveys of adolescents [35].
Our findings add weight to the growing evidence base on the poten-
tial pitfalls associated with lengthy time spent engaging on social media.

 These findings are highly relevant to current policy development on
guidelines for the safe use of social media and calls on industry to
more tightly regulate hours of social media use for young people [10,
11]. Clinical, educational and family settings are all potential points of
contact whereby young people could be encouraged to reflect not only
on their social media use but also other aspects of their lives including
online experiences and their sleep patterns. For instance, in the home
setting all family members could reflect on patterns of use and have in
place limits for time online, curfews for use and the overnight removal
of mobile devices from bedrooms. School settings present opportunities
for children and young people to learn how to navigate online life ap-
propriately and safely and for interventions aimed at promoting self-
esteem. Clearly a large proportion of young people experience dissatis-
faction with the way they look and how they feel about their bodies and
perhaps a broader societal shift away from the perpetuation of what are
often highly distorted images of idealised beauty could help shift these
types of negative perceptions.

 Clearly there are many benefits to be gained for young people by en-
gaging online. Our results and those of others highlight the likely com-
plexity of mechanisms at play. Future research using prospectively
collected data from the same population sample with the use of re-
peated measures and the application of causal analyses will help to pro-
vide a more comprehensive picture of the relationship between social
media use and young people's mental health. Given the short- and
long-term implications of having poor mental health, improving our un-
derstanding of underlying processes could help identify opportunities
for interventions with benefits across the lifecourse [4].
