In Brief
Mosquitoes show an ability to avoid
defensive hosts, but the mechanisms
mediating these shifts in host preferences
are unclear. Vinauger et al. show that
Aedes aegypti mosquitoes rapidly learn
host odors and that learning is dependent
on the dopamine-1 receptor.
Understanding the mechanisms of
learning may provide new tools for
mosquito control.

SUMMARY
How mosquitoes determine which individuals to bite
has important epidemiological consequences. This
choice is not random; most mosquitoes specialize
in one or a few vertebrate host species, and some
individuals in a host population are preferred over
others. Mosquitoes will also blood feed from other
hosts when their preferred is no longer abundant,
but the mechanisms mediating these shifts between
hosts, and preferences for certain individuals within a
host species, remain unclear. Here, we show that
olfactory learning may contribute to Aedes aegypti
mosquito biting preferences and host shifts. Training
and testing to scents of humans and other host spe-
cies showed that mosquitoes can aversively learn the
scent of specific humans and single odorants and
learn to avoid the scent of rats (but not chickens).
Using pharmacological interventions, RNAi, and
CRISPR gene editing, we found that modification of
the dopamine-1 receptor suppressed their learning
abilities. We further show through combined electro-
physiological and behavioral recordings from teth-
ered flying mosquitoes that these odors evoke
changes in both behavior and antennal lobe (AL)
neuronal responses and that dopamine strongly
modulates odor-evoked responses in AL neurons.
Not only do these results provide direct experimental
evidence
that
olfactory
learning
in
mosquitoes
can play an epidemiological role, but collectively,
they also provide neuroanatomical and functional
demonstration of the role of dopamine in mediating
this learning-induced plasticity, for the first time in
a disease vector insect.
INTRODUCTION
Mosquitoes are notorious for their proclivity in host species
preferences, and as some of us can attest, certain individuals are
preferred over others [1–3]. In addition, many mosquito species
can shift host species when their preferred blood resource is no
longer present [4–6]. Although the abundance of certain hosts
often determines mosquito choice (especially if the species is
opportunistic), even mosquitoes with a clear host specialization
may shift when their preferred host becomes less abundant
[4, 5, 7]. For example, the generalist mosquito Culex tarsalis in
California feeds primarily on birds inthe summer but on both mam-
mals and birds in the winter [5, 8]. This alteration is linked to fall
migration of robins, the mosquitoes’ preferred host. For the highly
anthropophilic species Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto, in an
environment where humans are not readily accessible, >80% of
mosquitoes still show an innate preference for human odor, even
though the proportion of human feeds is low (<40%) [4]. Together,
these results suggest that mosquitoes can feed on a readily avail-
able but less preferred host species as well as selectively bite
certain individuals within a host population [2]
How do mosquitoes alter their preferences? Although genetic
factors may be important (e.g., presence of conserved olfactory
receptors to host odors), physiological factors and the mosqui-
toes’ learning experiences using other blood hosts are likely
mechanisms guiding these shifts [6]. Over the last decade, evi-
dence of olfactory learning in blood-feeding insects has grown
for mosquitoes [9–12] and kissing bugs [13–15]. In parallel,
research in mosquito development and arousal to hosts have
demonstrated the importance of biogenic amines [16, 17], like
dopamine and octopamine, which in other insects, are also
involved in learning and memory [18–22]. Despite these research
foci, the links between how disease vector experience and
learning influence host preferences, and the neurophysiological
bases for learning, remain unclear.
For mosquitoes, hosts serve as both prey (source of food, i.e.,
blood) and predator. The host’s anti-parasitic and defensive
behaviors are a major source of mortality for adult female
mosquitoes [23]. Here, we take advantage of host defensive
behaviors to examine the ability of mosquitoes to learn the asso-
ciation between host odors and aversive stimuli. We specifically
asked (1) whether mosquitoes can aversively learn non-human
hosts and the scent from individual humans; (2) whether the
mosquito’s dopaminergic system, similar to what is found in
other insect species, is involved in aversive learning; and
(3) how biologically important odors are represented in the
mosquito brain and how dopamine modulates those responses.
Our results show that dopamine is necessary for aversive

 learning in mosquitoes and plays an important role in modulating
olfactory responses, allowing for an increased ability to discrim-
inate between odors and hosts.
RESULTS
Mosquitoes Learn to Avoid Host Odors
When encountering a defensive host, mosquitoes are exposed
to mechanical perturbations (e.g., swatting, shivering) that can
be perceived as negative reinforcement by the insect when
paired with other host-related cues such as host odors. Learning
the association between host odor and mechanical perturbation
would allow mosquitoes to use information gathered during pre-
vious host encounters. To determine whether mosquitoes can
aversively learn human body odor, 6-day-old mated Aedes
aegypti females were trained in small individual chambers to
associate host-related odorants (conditioned stimulus [CS])
with an aversive stimulus consisting of mechanical shocks/vibra-
tions (unconditioned stimulus [US]) mimicking host defensive be-
haviors (Figures 1A and 1B). 24 hr post training, the behavioral
response of mosquitoes was assessed in a Y-maze olfactometer
in which the insects had to fly upwind and choose between one
arm delivering the test odor (i.e., the CS odor) and a control arm
carrying only the solvent control (Figures 1C and 1D).
Ae. aegypti mosquitoes have a strong preference for human
hosts [24, 25] but also show strong variation in their attraction
to the odor of different individuals [26, 27]. The body odors of in-
dividual human subjects (five males, five females) were collected
with nylon sleeves (Figure S1), and mosquito responses were
tested in the Y-maze olfactometer. Whereas naive mosquitoes
were strongly attracted to human body odors (Figure 1F), trained
mosquitoes suppressed their attraction and treated the human
body odor the same as the no-odor control. This loss of attrac-
tion shown by trained mosquitoes was not a function of the phys-
iological stress or number of active individuals but rather was an
active decision in response to the previously experienced odor
and fly into the control arm (p > 0.05, Student’s t test compari-
sons of flight velocities and activity levels, n = 24–39; t > 3.8;
for all treatments depicted in Figures 1 and S2). As an important
control, we exposed mosquitoes to the CS and US in an un-
paired way, thereby preventing the temporal contingency
between the stimuli. These mosquitoes were not significantly
different from naive (p > 0.05) and were still significantly attracted
to human odors. Interestingly, not all human subjects elicited the
same levels of attraction in naive mosquitoes, and learning per-
formances differed between groups of trained mosquitoes as a
function of the individual human body odor used as a CS (Fig-
ure S1). These responses were not correlated with the concen-
tration of an individual’s body odor (R2 = 0.12; p = 0.32).
To test whether associative learning could also affect host
selection processes at interspecific levels, rat and chicken
body odors were collected using similar nylon sleeves and
used in training. The preference of mosquitoes for one of the
two host species was tested in the Y-maze olfactometer 24 h af-
ter training. In this experiment, one arm delivered the rat odor,
while the other delivered the chicken odor. Whereas naive
mosquitoes and mosquitoes from the unpaired group were
equally attracted to the scent of the two host species, mosqui-
toes trained against the rat odor were significantly more likely
to avoid the rat arm and flew preferentially into the arm delivering
the chicken odor (Figure 1G). Conversely, training did not affect
mosquito choice when the chicken odor was used as a CS.
These results mirror those obtained in the triatomine bug
Rhodnius prolixus, where bugs successfully learned the associ-
ation between rat body odors and a mechanical shock but did
not learn as well when bird odor was used as a CS [15].
The scents emitted by humans and other hosts are complex
mixtures of hundreds of odorants, making it difficult to identify
which features the mosquitoes might be using to learn the
association. We therefore examined the learning capabilities of
mosquitoes to single odorants, several of which are emitted
from hosts. One that elicited clear learning responses was
1-octen-3-ol (octenol), a common odorant found in the head-
space of mammals [11, 28, 29] but missing in birds (Figure 1E).
We therefore used octenol to more fully explore the ability of
mosquitoes to learn the association between the shock and a
single host-related odorant. 24 hr after training, mosquitoes
remembered the association between the mechanical shock
and octenol (Figure 1H), and their aversive response was com-
parable to the responses of naive mosquitoes to 40% DEET
(N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide), a concentration corresponding
to commercially available doses of this common insect repellent.
Again, mosquitoes from the unpaired group, or mosquitoes that
were exposed to either the CS or the US only, did not show
learned responses to octenol, clearly demonstrating the asso-
ciative nature of their learning.
Aversive Learning Modifies Odor-Guided Feeding
Preferences and Tethered Flight Responses
Evidence that learning modifies mosquito olfactory flight
preference does not necessarily mean that biting and landing
preferences might also be modulated. To examine this, we
trained groups of mosquitoes using our aversive learning
paradigm (Figures 1A and 1D) and released them into a cage
in which they had access to two artificial feeders filled with
heparinized bovine blood (37�C); one feeder was scented with
octenol, while the other was unscented (Figure 2A). Significantly
fewer trained mosquitoes landed on the octenol feeder
compared to the control feeder (p < 0.0001, binomial test; Fig-
ure 2B). Once they landed, an equal proportion of trained
mosquitoes initiated probing on the two feeders (p = 0.32,
paired Student’s t test, n = 10; t = �1.03; Figure 2C), although
we did observe a tendency for the mosquitoes to feed more
on the control feeder than the octenol feeder (24.6% and
15.6% of mosquitoes that landed initiated feeding, respec-
tively; p = 0.057, binomial test; Figure S3). By contrast, naive
mosquitoes demonstrated no preference in their landing and
biting responses to the two feeders (p = 0.22, binomial test).
The unpaired group showed a slight but significant increase in
the proportion of mosquitoes that landed on the scented
feeder (p = 0.002, binomial test), suggesting that prior exposure
to octenol modified their responses in this context. Together,
these results suggest that olfactory learning mediates long-
(>1 m) and short-range (�0.1 m) discrimination by the mosqui-
toes, but once the mosquitoes land, other cues (e.g., heat,
water vapor) may partially override these responses [32, 33].
To better understand how learning modulates flight responses
and to determine whether mosquitoes fly while tethered (thereby

 allowing simultaneous behavioral analysis and electrophysiolog-
ical recordings from the antennal lobe [AL]), we positioned
mosquitoes in the center of a virtual LED arena where they
were tethered by the thorax and maintained in a laminar airflow
(Figure 2D). An infrared (IR) light and a two-sided IR sensor al-
lowed real-time measurements of the mosquitoes’ wingstroke
frequency, amplitude, and turning tendency. Results showed
that naive and unpaired mosquitoes exhibited a frequency
increase in response to a brief octenol pulse, similar to a ‘‘surge’’
exhibited by free-flying mosquitoes when encountering an
odor plume. By contrast, trained mosquitoes significantly
decreased their flight frequency in response to the same
stimulus (p = 0.013, Student’s t test, n = 34; t = 2.67; Figures
2E, 2F, and S3).

 Dopamine Is Critical for Aversive Learning
Classical insect models for studying learning and memory have
shown that dopamine is a key neuromodulator involved in aver-
sive learning [19–22]. To test whether dopamine is also impli-
cated in aversive learning in mosquitoes, we used several
ways to manipulate dopamine receptors, including dopamine
receptor antagonist injections (Figure 3A, top left), gene knock-
down via RNAi (Figure 3A, top center), and CRISPR/Cas9
gene-editing methods (Figure 3A, top right). After aversive
training to octenol, mosquitoes were tested in the Y-olfactom-
eter (Figure 1C), allowing us to quantify their flight velocities
and behavioral preferences. First, adult female mosquitoes that
received dopamine receptor antagonist injections showed sig-
nificant deficits in their learning abilities compared to uninjected
and saline-injected mosquitoes, which showed robust learning
responses (Figure 3B). Similarly, female mosquitoes that were
injected with dsRNA targeting the Dop1 gene and CRISPR
mutants with a 6-amino-acid deletion of the Dop1 receptor
(Figure S4) showed significant learning deficits compared to
the uninjected, non-target dsRNA injected and saline-injected
control groups (p < 0.05, binomial test compared to control
groups; Figures 3B and S4). There were no significant differ-
ences in the responses of mosquitoes in treatment groups in
which the dopamine receptor was manipulated (i.e., antagonist
injected, dsRNA injected, CRISPR edited; p > 0.64, binomial
test). To evaluate the effects of dopamine receptor manipulation
on flight responses, we quantified the mosquito flight trajectories
in the olfactometer. Results showed that there was no significant
difference in flight velocity between dopamine-impaired treat-
ment groups or between those groups and the saline-injected
and uninjected controls (p > 0.05, Student’s t test, pairwise com-
parisons Holm p value adjustment, n = 17–29; t < 2.03; Figure S2),
suggesting that dopamine receptor manipulation did not affect
mosquito flight-motor responses. However, it is worth noting
that dsRNA-injected mosquitoes and Dop1 mutants were signif-
icantly less aroused to the odors than the other treatment groups

 (p < 0.05, binomial test; Figure S2C). Nonetheless, when these
dopamine-impaired mosquitoes were tested against CO2 or hu-
man host odors, they all showed significant attraction (p < 0.05,
binomial test; Figures 3C and 3D), revealing that manipulating
the dopamine receptors impaired their ability to learn aversive
information but did not affect their innate olfactory behavior.
Given the inability to learn octenol by the Dop1 mutants, how
might they respond to human scent that contains hundreds of
volatiles that are highly attractive to mosquitoes? Results
showed that naive Dop1 mutants were significantly attracted to
the scent of human hosts that were also attractive to wild-type
mosquitoes (p < 0.05, binomial test; Figures 3D and S1). Trained
Dop1 mutants failed to learn the association between the shock
and human odors, exhibiting similar behavioral responses to the
naive mosquitoes (p = 0.79 when compared to the naive CRISPR
tested against human odors, binomial test; Figure 3D). More-
over, responses by the trained Dop1 mutants contrasts those
of the trained wild-type mosquitoes, which showed learned aver-
sive responses to those same hosts (Figure 1F).

(A) Left: Dopamine receptor antagonists (DAA) (SCH-23390, bulbocapnine, flupentixol, and fluphenazine) were injected in the thorax of 6-day-old female
mosquitoes that were trained 30 min post injection and tested 24 hr later. Center: Dop1 and control dsRNA were injected in 1-day-old pupae, and after 6 days post
emergence, mosquitoes were trained and tested. Right: CRISPR/Cas9 constructs were injected in embryos. Mutants were backcrossed, screened and selected
by sequencing for five to eight generations before being trained at 6 days old.
(B–D) Mosquito choice in the olfactometer represented as a preference index. Trained mosquitoes from the Rockefeller, Liverpool strain, saline-injected, and

injected with dopamine receptor antagonists (blue-green bars), dsRNA-injected (red bar), and CRISPR mosquitoes (blue bar) showed no learning. Mosquitoes
injected with dopamine receptor antagonists (SCH-23398, 10�6 M) or dsRNA, as well as CRISPR mosquitoes, were still responding to positive controls such as
CO2 (C) or host odors (D). When human scents were used during training, CRISPR mosquitoes showed no learning (p = 0.79, binomial test). Each bar (mean ± SE)

 only certain odor stimuli can be learned [12], we next examined
how mosquitoes learn different odorants and how odor stimuli
are represented in the brain. 24 hr after training, behavioral re-
sponses showed that mosquitoes did not learn all odorants
equally. For example, whereas responses to nonanol were not
influenced by aversive training, those to octenol showed learned
aversive responses and L-(+)-lactic acid caused significant
attraction (Figures 1H and 4A). To evaluate how different host-
and plant-associated odorants are represented in the mosquito
brain, we performed extracellular recordings of projection neu-
rons (PNs) and local interneurons (LNs) in the antennal lobe
(AL), simultaneous with behavioral recordings (Figure 4B). The
extracellular recording method did not allow us to distinguish be-
tween PNs and LNs, but it did provide stable recordings (>1 h) of
multiple neural units (Figure S5) while allowing us to simulta-
neously quantify odor-evoked changes in wingbeat amplitudes.

 Whereas the mineral oil (no odor) control elicited no change in
behavioral and neural responses, stimulation with octenol and
ammonia elicited strong firing-rate responses in single units (Fig-
ure 4C). Interestingly, whereas ammonia elicited a 1–2 s change
in wingstroke activity, stimulation with octenol elicited much
longer behavioral responses that lasted many seconds beyond
the duration of the stimulus (400 ms) (Figure 4C). Examining
single-unit responses across the odor panel, we found that the
majority of units (�65%) showed strong odor-evoked responses,
with the remaining units showing no significant change in activity
(Figures 4D and S5). Moreover, some units (19%) were broadly
responsive to different odorants, including units that were
responsive to aromatics (e.g., benzaldehyde) and aliphatic com-
pounds (e.g., octenol), as well as monoterpenes (e.g., D-limo-
nene) (Figure S5). By contrast, others (27%) were more narrowly
tuned, including units that only responded to one chemical class.
In these experiments, hexanol, hexanal, butyric acid, cresol,
DEET, ammonia, and breath evoked behavioral responses
that were significantly higher than observed for the control
(p < 0.05, pairwise Student’s t tests with Holm correction for mul-
tiple comparisons, n = 10–16; t > 2.38). Interestingly, the behav-
ioral state (i.e., flying or non-flying) had a significant effect for
units that showed suppressed firing activity when stimulated
with an odor (p < 0.01, Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test, c2 = 6.95)
but not for units that showed excitatory responses (p = 0.51,
Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test, c2 = 0.44). It is also worth noting
that the spontaneous activity of units was slightly (but not signif-
icantly) higher when the mosquitoes were flying (p = 0.083,
Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test, c2 = 3.01).
At the neural population level, ensemble responses showed
distinct clustering in the multivariate (principal component
analysis) space based on the type and chemical class of the
olfactory stimuli (p < 0.001, ANOSIM; Figure 4E). For example,
monoterpenes and aromatics like D-limonene, b-myrcene, benz-
aldehyde, and cresol occupied a distinct region of the olfactory
space relative to the aliphatic acids, alcohols, and aldehydes.
By contrast, odor stimuli that evoked strong responses across
the ensemble (DEET, ammonia, and breath) were grouped
together and were significantly different from the other odorants
(p < 0.001, ANOSIM), demonstrating that the AL neural ensemble
can generalize among and discriminate between olfactory
stimuli.
Dopamine Selectively Modulates AL Neurons
To examine how dopamine modulates the processing of olfac-
tory information, we first used immunohistochemistry to examine
dopaminergic innervation (via tyrosine hydroxylase, a dopamine
precursor) in the mosquito brain. We found extensive dopami-
nergic innervation across the brain but particularly concentrated
in the ALs and lateral protocerebrum, including the mushroom
bodies (Figures 5Aand 5B), which are centers that mediate olfac-
tory learning and memory in insects [35, 36]. Dopaminergic
innervation is heterogeneous in the AL (Figures 5B and 5C),
with some glomeruli being more innervated than others,
including the MD2 glomerulus that receives input from the octe-
nol-sensitive aB2 neuron in the maxillary palp. Antisera against
the D1-like dopamine receptor Dop1 reveal staining of cell
bodies around the ALs, as well as enrichment in the lateral
protocerebrum surrounding the mushroom bodies (Figure 5D).
We therefore sought to determine the effects of dopamine on
odor-evoked responses of mosquitoes’ AL neurons.
To test for the neuromodulatory role of dopamine in mosqui-
toes, we simultaneously recorded the electrophysiological and
behavioral responses evoked by a sub-panel of odorants
comprised of octenol, L-(+)-lactic acid, b-myrcene, benzalde-
hyde, and ammonia before, during, and after superfusion of
dopamine (1 mM) over the brain. Dopamine application increased
odor-evoked firing-rate responses (Figures 6A and 6B) in 69.6%
of responsive AL units, decreased responses in 21.7% of units,
and had no effect in 8.7% of units. Dopamine also increased
the sensitivity of �17% of the recorded units, leading to a higher
number of cells responding to olfactory stimuli. These effects
could be washed out in approximately 50% of units, and in
contrast to preparations that were superfused with dopamine,
additional control experiments with mosquitoes that were
continuously superfused with saline showed no change in spon-
taneous responses (p > 0.05, pairwise comparisons using t tests
with pooled SD, t < 1.52; Figures S6B and S6C). Moreover, at the
level of the neural ensemble, odorant representation significantly
changed during dopamine application compared to the pre- and
wash-phases of the experiment (p < 0.05, ANOSIM) causing
stimuli—in particular, octenol—to become more separated in
the olfactory space (Figure 6C). Interestingly, the degree of mod-
ulation was not the same for all odorants, suggesting that the
observed differences in dopaminergic innervation of glomeruli
may be functionally linked to glomerular response modulation
(Figures 5B and 6C).
DISCUSSION
Heterogeneity in mosquito biting and consequently host infec-
tion plays an important role in the spread of vector-borne dis-
eases [37, 38], and previous studies have documented interindi-
vidual differences in attractiveness to mosquitoes [2], as well as
an ability for mosquitoes to shift species when their preferred
host is no longer available [4, 39]. Despite these studies, the pro-
cesses mediating these mosquito behaviors have remained un-
clear [40]. Here, we show that learning can contribute to these
host shifts and that their direction seems to be driven by the
composition of the host odor. One interesting note is that our
results suggest that human individuals that are highly attractive
to mosquitoes are the ones that mosquitoes can learn. These re-
sponses were not a function of the concentration of an individ-
ual’s scent but rather may be associated with the composition,
or ratio, of compounds in the odor. Mosquito learning may
thus partially explain host preference heterogeneity and flexi-
bility, and it may also elucidate which olfactory channels mediate
these changes.
In this study, we employed an integrative approach to demon-
strate that mosquito learning can influence both specificity for
individual hosts and their flexibility in olfactory preferences.
The ability of mosquitoes to aversively learn depended on
odorant type, for instance, L-(+)-lactic acid, an odorant emitted
by hosts, could be learned in an appetitive but not aversive
context [12], whereas octenol—another odorant emitted by
both plants [41] and blood hosts [28, 29]—could be appetitively
and aversively learned, suggesting that certain odorants may be
encoded by specific olfactory channels that allow rapid learning

 of attractive or defensive hosts or other important odor sources
(e.g., carbohydrates). In concert with these findings, our results
indicate that dopaminergic neurons are heterogeneous in their
innervation of glomeruli in the AL, which could provide a means
for mosquitoes to process, and selectively learn, specific odor-
ants from a complex bouquet emitted from individual hosts.
Indeed, our electrophysiological recordings revealed that the
AL represented the odorants by chemical class and activity level,
and dopamine—a critical neuromodulator involved in learning
and arousal [42]—further increased the separation of certain
odorants in the AL encoding space. Dop1 is critical for mediating
this plasticity in AL responses and learning abilities, with CRISPR
mutants for this receptor showing an inability to learn. The teth-
ered preparation and results in this study provide motivation for
future studies to examine how odor representations change
during training, thereby allowing direct coupling of learning
with how odor information is modulated in the AL and higher-
order brain regions.
Host defensive behavior is a major source of mortality for
mosquitoes [23], with hosts operating as both predator and
prey. In addition, within a host species, there is strong variation
in which individuals are bitten [1–3], and this heterogeneity in
mosquito biting is thought to play an important role in disease
transmission and epidemiology [2]. The ability by mosquitoes
to possibly learn which individuals are more, or less, defensive,
will have strong fitness consequences for the mosquitoes. How-
ever, despite obvious epidemiological relevance, a characteriza-
tion of the neuroanatomical and neural processes that allow
learning-induced plasticity was hitherto missing in disease
vector insects. The present work therefore closes a critical

 knowledge gap in mosquitoes by demonstrating the role of
dopamine in olfactory learning and processing. Finally, CRISPR
has been highlighted as an important tool in the fight against vec-
tor-borne disease [43, 44]. Notably, these mutants have allowed
us to target the dopaminergic pathway and impair mosquitoes’
ability to use their experience to fine-tune their responses to
host signals. Identifying the mechanisms and pathways enabling
flexibility in mosquito behavior may provide tools for more
effective mosquito control.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Mosquitoes rearing and colony maintenance
Multiple strains of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes were used for the experiments: Rockefeller (ROCK), Liverpool (LVP-IB12) and CRISPR
transgenic line from the Liverpool strain. Mosquitoes were maintained in a climatic chamber at 25 ± 1�C, 60 ± 10% relative humidity
(RH) and under a 12-12h light-dark cycle. Mosquitoes were fed weekly using an artificial feeder (D.E. Lillie Glassblowers, Atlanta, GA,
USA; 2.5 cm internal diameter) supplied with heparinized bovine blood (Lampire Biological Laboratories, Pipersville, PA, USA) and
heated at 37�C using a water-bath circulation (HAAKE A10 and SC100, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Cotton balls soaked
with 10% sucrose were continuously provided to the mosquitoes. Eggs were hatched in deionized water that contained powdered
fish food (Hikari Tropic 382 First Bites - Petco, San Diego, CA, USA), and larvae were cultured and maintained in trays containing
deionized water and the fish food. For the experiments, groups of 100 to 120 pupae (both males and females) of the same age
were isolated in individual containers and maintained exclusively on 10% sucrose after emergence (i.e., no blood-feeding). Six-
day-old female mosquitoes were individually isolated in 15 mL conical Falcon tubes (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA,
USA) covered by a piece of fine mesh that permitted odor stimulation during training. Experiments were conducted when the mosqui-
toes were the most active and responsive to host related cues: 2 hr before their subjective night [12, 45].
Dop1 Ae. aegypti mutant generation
sgRNAs that were specific for Dop1 were generated using in vitro transcription by combining primer pairs (primers 3 and 5) to make
sgRNA-Target 1 and combining primers pairs (primers 4 and 5) to make sgRNA-Target 2 (Table S1). We then combined these sgRNAs
(40 ng/ml) with purified Cas9 protein (300 ng/ml) purchased from PNA-bio (Newbury Park, CA, USA) and pre-blastoderm embryonic
microinjections (n = 300) were performed following previously established procedures [43]. Following microinjection we individually
isolated all surviving females (n = 68), mated, blood fed, and allowed them to lay eggs. After egg laying, we isolated genomic DNA
(QIAGEN DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Hilden, Germany)) from these females (focusing only on females that laid eggs (n = 29)) and
confirmed mutations in target sequences via PCR (standard techniques) with a primer pair that spans the cleavage sites amplifying
242bp of genomic DNA (primers 1 and 2). We discovered mutations in 68% (n = 20/29) of the injected G0 females that laid eggs.
Mosquitoes were individually outcrossed, using individual female to wild-type male crosses every generation for 6 generations.
We then selected a mutant line (that stably transmitted the mutation to the offspring) that generated an 18 nucleotide – 6 amino-
acid deletion (LRRIGN) in the conserved 7tm-4 superfamily domain and homogenized them for 9 generations. Mutations were verified
using PCR/sequencing every generation (100% mutants). Mutants from this line exhibited normal circadian rhythms, blood feeding,

 and oviposition rates – one of the reasons for selecting this line –, as well as exhibiting robust flight responses in our wind tunnel
bioassays. As additional controls, randomly selected mutant mosquitoes used in behavioral and electrophysiological assays were
verified using PCR/sequencing after testing (100% were mutants), and electrophysiological AL recordings from Dop1 mutants
showed no significant changes in neuronal odor-evoked responses and spontaneous activity during dopamine superfusion
(Figure S6), verifying the efficacy of the CRISPR Dop1 mutants. Primers and sgRNA sequences can be found in Table S1;
see also Figure S2.
Rats used in scent collections
Rat (Rattus norvegicus) scent collections were conducted using 4 male Sprague Dawley rats (350–420 g; Simonsen Laboratories).
The rats were maintained on a 12 h L/D cycle (lights on at 7:00 a.m.) and all scent collections were performed during the light phase.
Each rat was allowed access to water and food ad libitum. All animal care and use were conducted in accordance with University of
Washington’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines, and all procedures were approved by the Animal Care and
Use Committee of the University of Washington (IACUC Protocol # 4385-01) and conformed to principles enunciated in the NIH guide
for the use and care for laboratory animals.
Chicken hatchlings used in scent collections
Chicken (Gallus gallus) scent collections were from 12 unsexed White Leghorn 3-7 day old hatchlings, which were hatched from fertile
eggs (Featherland Farms, Coburg, OR) and maintained in vivarium facilities at the University of Washington. Hatchlings were not
sexed because of the difficulty in accurate identifying the sex at this age. Post-hatch chickens were maintained in heater brooders
with ample food and water under a 12 h L/D cycle (lights on at 8:00 a.m.), and all scent collections were performed during the light
phase. Animal care and experimental protocols involving the chicken hatchlings were approved by the University of Washington
Animal Care Committee (IACUC Protocol # 4385-01), and conformed to principles enunciated in the NIH guide for the use and
care for laboratory animals.
Humans used in scent collections
Human scent collections were collected from 5 males and 5 female wild-type individuals on the University of Washington (Seattle)
campus (ages 23-43 years old). Volunteers were from various backgrounds: Hispanic (one male), white (three males and three
females), and Asian (one male and two females). The number of individuals and samples (3-6 per volunteer) was sufficient for statis-
tical comparison between individuals (a = 0.05). Protocols were reviewed and approved by the University of Washington Institutional
Review Board, and all human volunteers gave their informed consent to participate in the research.
METHOD DETAILS
Host odor collection and GCMS analysis
Host body odors were collected using nylon sleeves (Ililily Inc., Irvine, CA, USA) that were worn for 3.5 hr. For human scent collection,
volunteers wore a nylon sleeve around each ankle and arm. For each human individual, a sleeve from an ankle and arm were paired,
and one pair was used to train the mosquitoes, and the other ankle+arm pair were used to test the mosquitoes. Volunteers used
fragrance-free detergents and soaps to prevent bias in mosquito behavior, and prior to wearing the sleeve individuals rinsed their
arm under water for 5 minutes. In addition, we also collected headspace volatiles from adult human volunteers as previously
described [46] by wrapping a volunteer’s arm in aluminum and piercing the aluminum with a 75um CAR/PDMS SPME fiber
(57344-U; Supelco, Bellefonte PA USA). Scent from rats and chicken hatchlings (from < 2 years old male rats and < 10-day-old
chicken hatchlings; both approximately the same mass) were collected by placing a nylon sleeve around the abdomen for 3.5 hr
(IACUC Protocol # 4385-01). To discriminate between endogenous and exogenous volatiles, controls were performed by keeping
clean nylon sleeves in clean, unoccupied rearing containers for the same duration as for the odor collection procedure. Host odors
were collected by either the SPME method or by dynamic sorption. The latter method involved enclosing the nylon socks in a nylon
oven bag (Reynolds Kitchens, USA). Air was withdrawn from the bag via a diaphragm vacuum pump (400-1901, Barnant Co.,
Barrington, IL, USA) and passed through a headspace trap comprised of a Pasteur pipette with 50 mg of Porapak powder Q
80-100 mesh (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA, USA) packed between two plugs of glass wool (Restek, Belfonte, PA, USA); air
was returned to the bag through a charcoal-filter. Headspace collections lasted for 24 hr. Volatiles were eluted from the traps
with 600 mL of 99% purity hexane (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), and samples were stored in 2 mL amber borosilicate vials
(VWR, Radnor, PA, USA) with Teflon-lined caps (VWR, Radnor, PA, USA) at �80�C until they were run on a Gas Chromatograph
coupled to a Mass Spectrometer (GCMS). Fibers were exposed to host volatiles for 1 hr before being run on the GCMS.
Liquid samples were injected (or SPME fibers were exposed) into an Agilent 7890A gas chromatograph (GCMS) with a 5975C
Network Mass Selective Detector (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA). A DB-5 GC column (J&W Scientific, Folsom, CA,
USA; 30 m, 0.25 mm, 0.25 mm) was used, and helium was used as the carrier gas at a constant flow of 1 cc.min�1. The oven tem-
perature was 45�C for 3.75 min, followed by a heating gradient of 10 degrees.min-1 to 250�C, which was then held isothermally for
10 min. Chromatogram peaks were manually integrated using the ChemStation software (Agilent Technologies), tentatively identified
by the NIST library before verification using Kovats Indices and synthetic standards (Figure S1).

 Mosquito training protocol and control groups
A total of 2524 individual female mosquitoes were used in the behavioral experiments. Before each training session, individual
mosquitoes were allowed to acclimate for 1 min in the absence of stimulation, except for the delivery of a clean air at 30 cm.s-1,
room temperature (23�C) and relative humidity (50%). Mosquitoes were then simultaneously exposed to the olfactory stimulus
(e.g., octenol at 140 mM; equivalent to the concentrations used in other mosquito training experiments [12]) and a mechanical shock
that was delivered for 30 s by a vortexer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) at 1.65 g at 44 Hz. Forces were scaled to host
defensive behaviors that occur when a human slaps his/her arm to drive off biting mosquitoes (Figures 1A and 1B) as well as exposing
mosquitoes to a strong mechanical perturbation without damaging their wings or causing apparent physiological and/or physical
damage. Mosquitoes were exposed to ten training trials, each separated by a 2 min interval. During this inter-trial interval (ITI),
mosquitoes were maintained in the same experimental room and exposed to a filtered air flow. A vacuum line was used throughout
the training session to remove environmental contaminants and olfactory stimuli from the container during the ITI. After conditioning,
mosquitoes were placed in a humidified climatic chamber (25�C; 60% RH; 12-12 h L:D) and tested in the Y-olfactometer 24 hr post-
training. Four types of control groups were used to test for the effects of aversive learning: a ‘‘naive’’ untrained group; a CS only, a US
only, and an ‘‘unpaired’’ group (Figure 1D). The CS and US only control groups controlled for the effect of pre-exposure to either the
odor or the mechanical shock, respectively. The ‘‘unpaired’’ group controlled for the associative nature of the learning, by exposing
mosquitoes to the odor and the mechanical shock in a pseudo-random, unpaired sequence, i.e., in the absence of temporal contin-
gency [47]. Each of the control groups was tested 24 hr later.
Behavioral testing in the olfactometer
We used a custom-made, Plexiglas Y-maze olfactometer to evaluate and compare mosquito responses to different odor stimuli, as
previously described [12] (Figure 1C). Briefly, the olfactometer comprised of a starting chamber, allowing mosquito release, an entry
tube (30 cm long, 10 cm diameter) connected to a central box where two ‘‘choice’’ arms were attached (both 39 cm long, and 10 cm
diameter). Charcoal filtered air entered as a uniform laminar flow at 20 cm.sec-1 into the arms of the olfactometer (Figure 1C). Odor
stimuli were delivered to each choice arm via teflon tubing connected to one of two 20mL scintillation vials containing either the tested
odor or the control solution (mineral oil) (Figure 1C). Each line was connected to the corresponding choice arm of the olfactometer and
placed centrally in the olfactometer arm. All the olfactometer experiments were conducted in a well-ventilated climatic chamber
(Environmental Structures, Colorado Springs, CO, USA) at 25�C and 50% RH. After each experiment, the olfactometer, tubing
and vials were cleaned up with water followed by 70% and then 100% ethanol to avoid any contamination between experiments.
Finally, to avoid any biases, the side of the stimulus and control arms was randomized daily.
Testing sessions began when one single mosquito was placed in the starting chamber. The mosquito then flew along the entry tube
and, at the central chamber, could choose to enter one of the olfactometer arms, one emitting the trained stimulus and the other the
‘‘clean air’’ (solvent only) control [12]. We considered the first choice made by mosquitoes when they crossed the entry of an arm.
Mosquitoes that did not choose or did not leave the starting chamber were considered as not responsive and discarded from the
preference analyses. Overall, 68.5% of the females were motivated to leave the starting chamber of the olfactometer and choose
between the two choice arms. In addition, four treatments were used to ensure that contamination did not occur in the olfactometer
and to test mosquitos’ responses to innately attractive or aversive stimuli. Untrained ‘‘naive’’ mosquitoes were placed in the
olfactometer and exposed to either: (1) two clean air currents (neutral control); (2) a clean air stream versus CO2 (positive control,
[CO2] = 2300 ppm above ambient level) [48]; (3) a clean air stream versus 40% DEET (an innately aversive control); or (4) a clean
air versus octenol (i.e., naive control). Mosquito trajectories were captured with a video camera (Model C615, Logitech, Newark,
CA, USA) (Figures 1F and S2) and mosquito flight speeds were calculated for each individual.
Behavioral testing with the artificial feeder
In order to test whether mosquitoes could use learned information in the context of blood-feeding, groups of 17 female mosquitoes
were released in a cage (30.5 3 30.5 3 30.5, Bioquip, Rancho Dominguez, CA, USA) on top of which two artificial feeders containing
heparinized bovine blood, warmed up to 37�C, were positioned. One feeder was treated with the CS odor (pipetted onto a Kimwipe
(Kimberly-Clark professionals, Roswell, GA, USA) surrounding the feeder), while the control feeder (odorless) was treated with the
solvent only (i.e., MilliQ water). Two video cameras (Model C615, Logitech, Newark, CA, USA) were used to record mosquitoes’
activity at each feeder over the course of the experiment (25 min duration) (Figures 2A) and the total number of landing, piercing
and feeding events was counted for each feeder. The position of the feeder associated with the CS odor was randomized in order
to avoid any potential spatial bias.
Behavioral testing in the flight arena
Tethered flight responses by mosquitoes to the trained odor were tested in an LED-based arena [30]. Mosquitoes were cold
anesthetized on ice and tethered to a tungsten wire using UV-activated glue (Loctite 3104 Light Cure Adhesive, Loctite, Du
¨ sseldorf,
Germany) applied on the thorax. The main body axis was positioned at a 30� angle from the tether. Mosquitoes were then stored at
room temperature in a closed container for an approximate 30 minutes recovery period. Tethered mosquitoes were centered in a
hovering position within an arena composed of 12 columns of 2 panels each [30], which were arranged into a regular dodecagon
and produced a display resolution of 96 3 16 pixels (Figure 2D). Mosquitoes were placed directly under an infrared (IR) diode and
situated above an optical sensor coupled to a wingbeat analyzer [30, 49, 50] (JFI Electronics, University of Chicago). The beating
e4
Current Biology 28, 333–344.e1–e8, February 5, 2018
 wings cast a shadow onto the sensor, allowing the analyzer to track the motion of both wings and measure the amplitude and
frequency of each wing stroke. Measurements were sampled at 5 kHz and acquired with a National Instrument Acquisition board
(BNC �2090A, National Instruments, Austin, Texas, USA). The mosquito was centered between an air inlet and a vacuum line aligned
diagonally with one another, 30� from the vertical axis (Figure 2D). The air inlet was positioned 12 mm in front of and slightly above the
mosquito’s head, targeting the antennae from an angle of 15�. The vacuum line was positioned behind the mosquito 25 mm away
from the tip of the abdomen. Two different airlines independently controlled by a solenoid valve intersected this main air inlet, either
delivering clean air or an odor. A static visual pattern of alternating stripes comprised of either inactive or fully-lit LEDs, each 16 3 6
pixels in size (22.5�) was used in conjunction with the odor stimulus. Odor stimuli consisted of a 400 ms pulse followed by a 60 s inter-
trial-interval, after which the sequence was repeated for a total of 10 pulses. Three groups of mosquitoes were tested: naive (n = 16),
octenol-trained (n = 17), and unpaired (n = 18). A clean air control (n = 23) was also performed.
The wingbeat frequency and amplitude were used as proxy for changes in the flight speed of the insect, as an increase in these
signals is an indicator of ‘‘surge’’ behaviors to an odor plume in free-flight [51]. For each odor pulse, a baseline wingbeat frequency
was determined by averaging the frequency across a 1 s time window preceding the odor delivery and then subtracting this value
from the frequency values following the pulse. Trials were discarded in which mosquitoes had frequency fluctuations greater than
5 Hz in this 1 s window or frequency changes greater than 30 Hz that did not begin within the four seconds following the octenol
stimulation (as they presumably were not in response to the stimulus). On average, 5 out of the 10 trials were discarded per mosquito.
Interrogation of dopamine pathways in the mosquito brain
To evaluate the impact of dopamine on mosquito olfactory learning, we used three different approaches: 1) dopamine receptor
antagonist injections; 2) knockdown of Dop1 using RNA interference and 3) modification of Dop1 using the CRISPR/Cas9 method.
Pharmacological suppression of learning using dopamine receptor antagonists
To evaluate the impact of dopamine on mosquito olfactory learning, we used dopamine receptor antagonists that targeted
different dopamine receptor types: Bulbocapnine (Dop1 receptor antagonist - D046-25MG), SCH-23390 (Dop1 receptor
antagonist - D054-5MG), Fluphenazine (Dop1 and Dop2 receptor antagonist - F4765-1G) and Flupentixol (Dop1 and Dop2
receptor antagonist - Y0000054) (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). All antagonists were dissolved in saline and used at a
concentration of 10�6 M.
Six-day-old mated adult females, that had never been blood fed, were placed on ice to immobilize them before injection.
Borosilicate capillaries (Sutter instrument, Novato, CA, USA - #BF100-78-10,) were pulled to form micropipettes using a
P-2000 laser puller (Sutter Instrument Co., Novato, CA, USA) and filled with either the dopamine receptor antagonist or saline
as an injection control. A micropipette was then connected to a Picospritzer (Picospritzer III, Parker Hannifin, NJ, USA). In order
to calibrate injection volumes between micropipettes, the diameter of a drop of solution in mineral oil over a micrometre was
measured before each injection session. Two drops of a diameter of 500 ± 10 mm (65 nL) of the solution containing the receptor
antagonist or saline (control) were injected on the side of the thorax. After injection, mosquitoes were able to recover for 30 minutes
before being trained. A group of naive mosquitoes (injected but not trained) was used in parallel to determine whether antagonist
or saline injections influenced innate responses to carbon dioxide. The injected females were tested 24 h post-treatment in the
olfactometer as described above.
In a separate experiment, we fed mosquitoes with dopamine receptor antagonists, trained them and tested their behavioral
response to octenol as previously described. We first used bulbocapnine (10�6 M) and then tested a combination of three drugs
(bulbocapnine, SCH-23390 and fluphenazine) at either 10�6 M or 10�3 M. Ten microliters of the drug solution was diluted in
10 mL sucrose to which we added a few droplets of green food colorant in order to check for sucrose intake by female mosquitoes
through their abdomen by transparency. One microliter of 1 mM DMSO (Sigma, Saint Louis, MO, USA) was added to the solution to
help preventing any chemical degradation. Cotton balls imbibed with this solution were placed above containers with female mosqui-
toes and were given 24 hr to feed before training. Mosquitoes fed with bulbocapnine alone were still able to learn (PI = �0.46; p < 0.05,
binomial test), but those fed with the drug combination did not show learning (PI = �0.14 and 0, at 10�6 and 10�3 M respectively;
p > 0.05, binomial test; for both concentrations).
Knockdown of Dop1 using RNA interference
Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) of Dop1 and Drosophila nautilus (non-targeting control, #M68897) genes were synthesized by in vitro
transcription using the MEGAscript RNAi kit (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA - AM1626) following the manufacturer’s
recommendations. The integrity of the products was assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis (0.8%) to ensure that the fragments
were of the proper size and not degraded. After synthesis, the dsRNA was precipitated using sodium acetate and ethanol and resus-
pended in nuclease free water (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The concentration and integrity of the dsRNA were
determined by spectrometry (NanoDrop 2000c, Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, DE, USA) and electrophoresis. The dsRNA was
then kept at �80�C until the injections were performed. Before the injection, the dsRNA was thawed and diluted in water to the
desired concentration. Injections were performed using a pulled borosilicate pipette [sensu 26]. The pupae were briefly anesthetized
on ice before injection and maintained on a cold aluminum block during the whole injection process. Each pupa received a micro-
injection of 66 nL dsRNA diluted in water which represents a concentration of 100 ng of dsRNA. The injected pupae were then placed
in a plastic container of water (BioQuip, Rancho Dominguez, CA, USA - 1425DG) to recover until emergence. The injection of 100 ng
of Dop1 dsRNA led to a survival of 50% of the pupae while 95% of the pupae emerged after being injected with the non-targeting
control dsRNA (Figure S4). The level of knockdown was assessed with RT-qPCR and western blots. We observed a decrease in

 the mRNA for Dop1 in 60% of the injected mosquitoes and the knockdown was of about 30% (Figure S4), similar to what was found in
other studies [52].
After the behavioral experiments, the mosquitoes’ heads were excised on a cold aluminum block and flash frozen using liquid
nitrogen to preserve the RNA integrity. The total RNA of the mosquitoes’ heads was extracted using the RNAqueous Micro Kit
(ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA - AM1931) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The total amount of RNA per
sample was measured by spectrometry (NanoDrop 2000c, Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, DE, USA) and a 1% agarose gel was ran
to assess for RNA quality and integrity as well as for possible gDNA contamination. 80 ng of RNA were then used for the reverse tran-
scription reaction. We used the SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis Supermix for qRT-PCR kit (ThermoFisher - Cat No. 11752-250) to
produce cDNA following the manufacturer’s instructions. The qPCRs were prepared using the SYBR Select Master Mix (ThermoFisher
Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA - Cat. No. 4472903) and were performed on an ABI StepOnePlus Real Time PCR machine (ThermoFisher
Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) using specific primers (Dop1-F: 50-AACGATTTACTGGG CTACTGG-30; Dop1-R: 50-CCTTGATGT
GGATGTACCGG-30; RPS7-F: 50-TCAGTGTACAA GAAGCTGACCGGA-30; RPS7-R: 50-TTCCGCGCGCGCTCACTTATTAGATT-30 - In-
tegrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA, USA). RPS7 was used as a housekeeping gene. Triplicates of each reaction were done for a
single PCR plate (TempPlate Semi-Skirt 0.1mL PCR plates, USA Scientific, Inc., Ocala, FL, USA - Cat. No. 1402-9100; MicroAmp
Clear Adhesive Films, ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA - Cat. No. 4306311) and the reactions were performed twice.
The expression of Dop1 relative to the endogenous control was determined using the quantitative DDCt method from the StepOne
Software v2.3.
CRISPR/Cas9
The short guide RNAs (sgRNAs) used for CRISPR/Cas9 were designed to target the first exon of the conserved Dop1
(AAEL003920)(Figure S4; Table S1). To define the sgRNA genomic target sites several factors were considered. First, Ae. aegypti
transcriptional databases were utilized to confirm RNA expression of putative target regions [53]. We then performed blast searches
to hunt for conservation and discovered an important conserved receptor domain termed 7tm-4 superfamily domain (pfam13853)
that we decided to target [54]. To minimize potential off-target effects, we confirmed specificity of our sgRNAs using publicly avail-
able bioinformatic tools [55] and selected the most specific sgRNAs within our target region.
Immunohistochemistry
The polyclonal antiserum against tyrosine hydroxylase (ImmunoStar, Hudson, WI, USA - Cat. no. 22941) was used at a concentration
of 1:50 and monoclonal antisera against synapsin I (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA - Cat. No. WH0006853M7) were used at a
concentration of 1:100 for immunohistochemistry. The antibody against the D1-like dopamine receptor, Dop1 was custom made
by 21st Century Biochemicals against a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 138-154 of the Ae. aegypti protein, affinity
purified, and used at a concentration of 1:100 for immunohistochemistry. This antibody was also used at a concentration of 1:1000 for
western blot assays and recognizes a band with a mass of �72 kDa. Deglycosylation of protein samples with glycerol-free PNGase F
(New England BioLabs, Ipswich, MA, USA - Cat. No. P0705) resulted in detection of a band at the expected molecular weight of
�41 kDa. To further test specificity of this antibody, sections of Ae. aegypti brain tissue were divided into two wells and incubated
with either antibody preadsorbed with 100 mM of the Dop1 peptide (used to produce the antibody in rabbit) or with antibody alone and
then processed for immunohistochemistry, as described below. Both wells were additionally incubated with antisera against synap-
sin I as a positive control for staining. Preadsorption with peptide from Dop1 abolished Dop1-like immunoreactivity, while synapsin-
like immunoreactivity remained (Figures 5).
Animals were immobilized by refrigeration at 4�C and heads were removed into cold (4�C) fixative containing 4% paraformalde-
hyde in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4 (PBS, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA -Cat. No. P4417). Heads were fixed for 1 h
and then brains were dissected free in PBS containing 4% Triton X-100 (PBS-TX; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA - Cat. No.
X100). Brains were incubated overnight at 4�C in 4% PBS-TX. The next day, brains were washed three times over 10 minutes
each in 0.5% PBS-TX and then embedded in agarose. The embedded tissue was cut into 60 mm serial sections using a Vibratome.
Sections were placed in a well plate for further processing. Sections were washed in PBS containing 0.5% PBS-TX six times over
20 minutes. Then 50 mL normal serum was added to each well containing 1,000 mL PBS-TX. After 1 hour, primary antibody was added
to each well and the well plate was left on a shaker overnight at room temperature. The next day, sections were washed six times over
3 h in PBS-TX. Then 1,000 mL aliquots of PBS-TX were placed in tubes with 2.5 mL of secondary Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 546-
conjugated IgGs (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 15 minutes. A 900 mL aliquot of this
solution was added to each well. The well plate was left on a shaker to gently agitate the sections overnight at room temperature.
Tissue sections were then washed in PBS six times over 3 h, embedded on glass slides in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlin-
game, CA, USA - Cat. No. H-1000). Brain tissue was imaged using a Leica SP5 laser scanning confocal microscope. Maximum
intensity projections were processed using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health) and selected images were assembled using Adobe
Photoshop CS4 (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA, USA).
For western blots, brain tissue for Ae. aegypti was homogenized in lithium dodecyl sulfate (LDS) sample buffer with a protease
inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). The Novex electrophoresis system was used for protein separation [56].
Electrophysiology mosquito preparation
A total of 74 units recorded from 22 individuals, were exposed to a total of 418 odor stimulations in the electrophysiology
experiments. Mosquitoes were immobilized on ice and mounted on a custom-designed holder (Figure 4B) using UV-cured glue
e6
Current Biology 28, 333–344.e1–e8, February 5, 2018
 (Bondic, Non Toxic Liquid Plastic Welder, BondicUSA, Fairfield NJ, USA). Each mosquito was tethered to the holder by the head
capsule and the anterior-dorsal tip of the thorax, allowing steady electrophysiological recordings while the mosquito beats its wings
in a fictive form of flight (Figure 4). All six legs were removed to prolong the flight bouts. A hole was cut in the cuticle of the head
capsule to expose the antennal lobes, and then trachea and muscles 8 and 11 were removed. The brain was superfused continuously
with temperature-controlled physiological saline solution (20�C) using a bipolar temperature controller and an in-line heater/cooler
(CL-100 and SC-20, Warner Instruments).
The extracellular saline was made based on the Beyenbach and Masia recipe [57] and contained 150.0 mM NaCl, 25.0 mM
N-2-hydroxyethyl-piperazine-N’-2-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), 5.0 mM sucrose, 3.4 mM KCl, 1.8 mM NaHCO3, 1.7 mM
CaCl2, and 1.0 mM MgCl2. The pH was adjusted to 7 with 1 M NaOH. Immediately before the experiment, dopamine was dis-
solved to 1 mM in extracellular saline (this is equivalent to concentrations used in other studies of olfactory learning [58]. A drip
system comprising two 100 mL reservoirs – one containing dopamine, and the other saline – converged on the two-channel tem-
perature controller to facilitate rapid switching from normal physiological saline solution to dopamine and back. Dopamine was
superfused directly into the holder near to the opening of the head capsule and recorded neuropil. The odor-evoked responses
were first recorded under normal physiological saline solution and then repeated under dopamine diluted in normal saline solution,
and finally the normal saline wash.
Coupled extracellular and behavioral recordings, spike sorting, and analysis
The tethered mosquito was placed on a Nikon FN-1 microscope (Eclipse FN1, Nikon Instruments Inc., Melville, NY, USA) under 20X
objective (UMPlanFI, Olympus, Japan) to allow precise positioning of the recording electrode in one of the antennal lobes. Electrodes
were pulled from quartz glass capillaries using a Sutter P-2000 laser puller and filled with 0.1 M LiCl. The electrode was positioned
under visual control using the FN1 microscope and advanced slowly through the antennal lobe using a micromanipulator (PM10 -
World Precision Instruments) until spikes were apparent in the recording channel. To determine the position of the recordings, the
tip of each electrode was dipped into a solution of 2% Texas Red (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) dissolved in
0.5 M potassium chloride solution before placement in the brain. After recording experiments, brains were imaged and z stacks
were taken at 1 mm steps using a two-photon microscope (Prairie Technologies Inc.).
Electrophysiological signals were amplified 10,000X and filtered (typically 0.1–5 kHz) (A-M Systems Model 1800, Sequim, WA,
USA), recorded and digitized at 10 kHz using WinEDR software (Strathclyde Electrophysiology Software, Glasgow, UK) and a
BNC-2090A analog-to-digital board (National Instruments, Austin, TX, USA) on a personal computer. Spike data were extracted
from the recorded signal and sorted using a clustering algorithm based on the method of principal components (PCs) (Offline Sorter;
Plexon, Dallas, TX, USA). Only those clusters that were separated in three-dimensional space (PC1–PC3) after statistical verification
(multivariate ANOVA: p < 0.1) were used for further analysis (2-6 units were isolated per preparation; n = 22 preparations from as many
mosquitoes; Figure S5A). Each spike in each cluster was time-stamped, and these data were used to create raster plots and to calcu-
late peri-stimulus time histograms (PSTHs), interspike interval histograms, and rate histograms.
To couple electrophysiological and behavioral responses, we used a set-up [59, 60] where an infrared camera (PointGrey Firefly
MV FMVU-03MTC) was placed below the preparation. This set-up allowed an easy positioning of the recording electrodes, visual-
ization of the flight responses, and stimulation of the preparation with olfactory stimuli. IR LEDs were used to illuminate the wings,
abdomen and proboscis, and images were recorded at 60 frames/s. A Python-based open source software (Kinefly [61]) calculated
the wingbeat stroke amplitudes for each wing per frame. Because mosquito wing-beat frequencies are well above 400 Hz (and above
the frame rate of the camera), and since the product of frequency and amplitude rises linearly with increasing flight force [49], wing
stroke amplitude was used as a proxy for surge behavior in free flying insects. Wingstroke amplitude was timestamped and acquired
simultaneously with electrophysiological recordings. Amplitude data were averaged across preparations and depicted as the abso-
lute change in amplitude so that comparisons were possible across odors, including attractants, but also neutral and aversive
compounds.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSES
Olfactometer behavioral data analysis
Binary data collected in the olfactometer were analyzed and all statistical tests were computed using R software (R Development
Core Team [62]). Comparisons were performed by means of the Exact Binomial test (a = 0.05). For each treatment, the choice of
the mosquitoes in the olfactometer was either compared to a random distribution of 50% on each arm of the maze or to the distri-
bution of the corresponding control when appropriate. For binary data, the standard errors (SE) were calculated as in [63]:
SEM =
�pð1 � pÞ
n
�1
2
For each experimental group, a preference index (PI) was computed in the following way: PI = [(number of females in the test
arm – number of females in the control arm) / (number of females in the control arm + number of females in the test arm)]. A PI
of +1 indicates that all the motivated mosquitoes chose the test arm, a PI of 0 indicates that 50% of insects chose the test arm
and 50% the control arm, and a PI of �1 indicates that all insects chose the control arm of the olfactometer (adapted from [18]).

 Means of instantaneous flight speeds were analyzed in Excel and flight speed comparisons were made in R, by means of
Student’s t test (a = 0.05).
Flight arena behavioral data analysis
Flight arena data was analyzed by the mean response for each individual that was calculated from the saved trials and used as a
replicate to calculate the mean response for each treatment group. This latter was calculated using the difference in frequency before
(200 ms before the odor stimulation) and after the odor delivery (starting at 1 s and ending 3 s after the pulse). One-tailed Student’s t
tests for paired samples were used to test for differences from baseline and t tests for independent samples were used to test for
differences between groups. All analyses were performed in R.
Electrophysiological data analysis
Analyses of electrophysiological data were performed with R (R Core Team [62]) and Neuroexplorer (Nex Technologies, Winston-
Salem, NC, USA) using a bin width of 20 ms, unless noted otherwise. We quantified the control corrected response for every unit
by calculating a response index (RI). RI values reflect the deviation from the mean response of all units across all odors in one
ensemble, as RI = (Rodor - Rm)/SD, where Rodor is the number of spikes evoked by the test odor minus the number evoked by the
control stimulus, Rm is the mean response, and SD is the standard deviation across the data matrix.
