New Findings
r What is the central question of this study?
What are the factors influencing day–night variations in postprandial triglycerides?
r What is the main finding and its importance?
Rats show low postprandial plasma triglyceride concentrations early in the active period that
are attributable to a higher uptake by skeletal muscle and brown adipose tissue. We show
that these day–night variations in uptake are driven by the suprachiasmatic nucleus, probably
via a Rev-erbα-mediated mechanism and independent of locomotor activity. These findings
highlight that the suprachiasmatic nucleus has a major role in day–night variations in plasma
triglycerides and that disturbances in our biological clock might be an important risk factor
contributing to development of postprandial hyperlipidaemia.
Energy metabolism follows a diurnal pattern, mainly driven by the suprachiasmatic nucleus
(SCN), and disruption of circadian regulation has been linked to metabolic abnormalities.
Indeed,epidemiologicalevidenceshowsthatnightworkisariskfactorforcardiovasculardisease,
and postprandial hyperlipidaemia is an important contributor. Therefore, the aim of this work
was to investigate the factors that drive day–night variations in postprandial triglycerides (TGs).
Intact and SCN-lesioned male Wistar rats were subjected to an oral fat challenge during the
beginning of the rest phase (day) or the beginning of the active phase (night). The plasma TG
profile was evaluated and tissue TG uptake assayed. After the fat challenge, intact rats showed
lower postprandial plasma TG concentrations early in the night when compared with the day.
However, no differences were observed in the rate of intestinal TG secretion between day and
night. Instead, there was a higher uptake of TG by skeletal muscle and brown adipose tissue
early in the active phase (night) when compared with the rest phase (day), and these variations
were abolished in rats bearing bilateral SCN lesions. Rev-erbα gene expression suggests this as
a possible mediator of the mechanism linking the SCN and day–night variations in TG uptake.
These findings show that the SCN has a major role in day–night variations in plasma TGs by
promoting TG uptake into skeletal muscle and brown adipose tissue. Consequently, disturbance
of the biological clock might be an important risk factor contributing to the development of
hyperlipidaemia.

Suprachiasmatic nucleus mediates postprandial triglyceride uptake
Introduction
The circadian system co-ordinates the temporal changes
in metabolism according to the environmental light–dark
(LD) periodicity. The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN),
at the base of the anterior hypothalamus, is the master
pacemaker of the circadian system. By receiving light
input from the retinohypothalamic tract, its activity is
synchronized to the LD cycle (Meijer et al. 2010) and
drives circadian rhythms (Hastings et al. 2003; Kalsbeek
et al. 2007). The SCN has neuronal connections mainly
to hypothalamic target areas, which receive the daily
signal of the SCN and use it to adapt their output in
agreement with the time of the day. The hypothalamus is
an excellent target area for the SCN, because it is not
only essential for the control of hormonal output but
also for the autonomic control of body functions (Buijs &
Kalsbeek, 2001). Thus, the essence of SCN function is the
organization of synchrony between hormonal, autonomic
and behavioural functions. At the metabolic level, the SCN
drives daily fluctuations in body temperature (Scheer et al.
2005), glucose tolerance (Fleur et al. 2001) and peripheral
and hepatic insulin sensitivity (Coomans et al. 2013).
Indeed, disruption of circadian regulation, produced by
inadequate times of food intake (i.e. during the night in
humans and day in rodents), are suggested to promote
obesityandmetabolicabnormalities(Garauletetal.2010).
Elevated plasma triglycerides (TGs) as a part of
atherogenic
dyslipidaemia
are
associated
with
the
pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases (Hyson et al.
2003), the main cause of death worldwide (Mendis et al.
2011). In the last decade, epidemiological studies have
documented that postprandial TG concentrations are
correlated with the incidence of cardiovascular events,
suggesting that postprandial plasma TGs are a good
marker for the risk of cardiovascular disease (Miller
et al. 2011). In humans, postprandial TG responses vary
during the day, being higher during the resting phase than
during the active phase (Romon et al. 1997; Sopowski
& Hampton, 2001), suggesting the involvement of the
SCN or behavioural activity. Moreover, epidemiological
studies show that night workers, who have activity and
meal patterns shifted towards the night, have an increased
risk for cardiovascular diseases (Gu et al. 2015).
Postprandial plasma TG concentrations derive mainly
from intestinal production of lipoproteins and their
clearance by peripheral tissues. Studies in enterocytes and
intestinal loops show a circadian variation in intestinal
lipid absorption (Hussain, 2014), and lipoprotein lipase
(LPL), the enzyme responsible for TG clearance from
the circulation (Kotas et al. 2013), also shows circadian
regulation that is tissue specific (Benavides et al. 1998).
However, until now there has been no evidence in
animalmodelsofday–nightvariationsinpostprandialTG.
Recently, brown adipose tissue (BAT) has been pointed
out as a major player in plasma TG clearance (Dijk et al.
2015), where its activation by cold exposure normalized
plasma TG concentrations even in pathological situations
(Bartelt et al. 2011). Nonetheless, very little is known
about the mechanisms driving the daily fluctuations in
the postprandial TG profile. Therefore, the present study
was designed to assess, in rats, the factors influencing
day–night fluctuations in postprandial TGs. We assessed
variations between the beginning of the active (night)
and rest (day) phase in postprandial TGs, chylomicron
secretion and TG uptake by different tissues, as well as the
role of the SCN in these variations.
Methods
Ethical approval
All animal experiments were approved by the Committee
forEthicalEvaluationattheBiomedicalResearchInstitute,
Universidad Nacional Aut´
onoma de M´
exico (UNAM;
approval number 140106) and were carried out in strict
accordance with the Mexican norms for animal handling
(Norma Oficial Mexicana NOM-062-ZOO-1999) and
the policy of the Institute for Laboratory Animal
Research (ILAR) Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals. The study complied with the ethical principles
under which Experimental Physiology operates, and the
experiments complied with the journal’s animal ethics
principles and regulation checklist (Grundy et al. 2015).
After experiments using awake, freely moving animals, the
rats were deeply anaesthetized and killed by anaesthetic
overdose of sodium pentobarbital, 150 mg kg−1, I.P. (Pisa,
Mexico city, Mexico).
Animals
Male Wistar rats (Rattus norvegicus, 230–250 g), obtained
from the general vivarium at the Faculty of Medicine
in UNAM, were housed (three rats per cage) under a
12 h–12 h LD cycle, with lights on at 07.00 h considered
Zeitgeber time 0 (ZT0). Water and regular laboratory
rodent diet (Purina, Chow 5010; Richmond, IN, USA)
were provided ad libitum throughout the study, unless
stated otherwise. Rats were adapted for 1 week to housing
conditions before starting the experimental protocol.
Experimental design
Experiment 1: day–night variations in postprandial TG.
Rats were submitted to an oral fat test (OFT) 2 h after
light onset (ZT2) or 2 h after dark onset (ZT14; n = 6
per group). For this purpose, rats were trained for 5 days
consecutively to receive the intragastric cannula, in order
to avoid stress on the day of the experiment. Rats were

fasted for 24 h before the experiment, with ad libitum
access to water. Basal blood samples were collected from
the tail vein, and rats were then gavaged intragastrically
with 1 ml of melted butter. Subsequent blood samples
were collected at 15, 30, 60, 120, 180 and 240 min after
the fat gavage. Plasma was separated from whole blood
by centrifugation (4600 g; 4°C; 10 min) and TGs were
measured by using an enzymatic–photometric assay kit
(ELItech Clinical Systems, Sees, France).
Experiment 2: day–night variations in intestinal TG
secretion. For this experiment, rats used in experiment 1
were left for a 10 day washout period and then the OFT was
performed at the same time points (n = 4 per group). Rats
werefastedfor24h,basalbloodsampleswerecollectedand
followed by an I.P. injection of poloxamer 407 [150 g l−1
in saline, 1 g (kg body weight)−1; P-407; Sigma-Aldrich
Co.] to inhibit LPL activity. Forty-five minutes later,
an intragastric bolus of melted butter (1 ml per rat)
was administered to each rat. Blood was collected from
the tail vein at 1 h intervals until 4 h after gavage.
Plasma samples were collected as described previously,
for TG determination. In another set of rats (ZT2 and
ZT14; n = 3 per group) the OFT was performed, with
prior incorporation of 10 μCi of a radioactive tracer,
3H[9,10]-triolein (Perkin-Elmer, Boston, MA, USA) into
the fat bolus. Two hours after gavage, rats were deeply
anaesthetized and killed with an overdose of sodium
pentobarbital 150 mg kg−1, I.P. Plasma samples were
collected and counted on a TriCarb scintillation counter
(Perkin-Elmer, Boston, MA, USA).
Experiment 3: intravenous fat tolerance test. In another
group of rats, an intravenous fat tolerance test was
performed at ZT2 and ZT14 (n = 6 per group). For this
purpose,jugularvenouscatheterswereimplanted6–7days
before the test, under deep anaesthesia with a mixture of
ketamine (40–80 mg kg−1) and xylazine (5–8 mg kg−1)
injected I.M. Intravenous fat tolerance test was performed
by injecting rats fasted for 24 h with 400 μl of Intralipid
20% fat emulsion (Fresenius kabi, Deerfield, IL, USA).
Blood was collected from the tail vein at 5, 15, 30, 60 and
90 min after infusion. Plasma samples were collected as
described previously, for TG determination.
Experiment 4:
postprandial TG
in
rats
in
constant
darkness. The daily LD cycle is the main synchronizer
of the circadian clock, where photic information entrains
the pacemaker to a period of exactly 24 h. To exclude
a direct influence of light input rather than of the SCN
activity, we performed the OFT on rats maintained in
constant dark (DD) conditions for 36 h and tested 2 h into
the subjective light period (CT2). For this purpose, rats
were kept in DD for 36 h, and the OFT was performed
at 09.00 h, corresponding to 2 h into their subjective day
CT2 (n = 5 per group). Data were compared with values
of the ZT2 group in experiment 1.
Experiment 5: in vivo postprandial TG uptake in intact
rats. To determine the postprandial TG uptake by the
different tissues, this test was performed on intact rats
at ZT2 and ZT14 (n = 5 or 6 per group). For this
purpose, 10 μCi of a radioactive tracer, 3H[9,10]-triolein
(Perkin-Elmer, Boston, MA, USA), was included in the fat
bolus. Two hours or 4 h after gavage, rats were deeply
anaesthetized and killed with an overdose of sodium
pentobarbital 150 mg kg−1, I.P. Immediately thereafter,
they were perfused with cold saline, via the heart,
to remove blood and non-internalized triglyceride-rich
lipoproteins (TRL) from the organs. Subsequently,
samples of liver, heart, soleus muscle, epididymal white
adipose tissue (WAT), retroperitoneal WAT, subcutaneous
WAT and interscapular BAT were collected. Individual
tissues were flash frozen immediately after harvest, and
samples of the different tissues were then dissolved
in Solvable (Perkin-Elmer, Boston, MA, USA) tissue
solubilization buffer, according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Solubilized samples were bleached with
hydrogen peroxide before scintillation counting in Ultima
Gold mixture (Perkin-Elmer, Boston, MA, USA) on a
TriCarb scintillation counter (Perkin-Elmer, Boston, MA,
USA).
Experiment 6: in vivo postprandial TG uptake in rats
bearing bilateral lesions of the SCN (SCNX). The SCN
is the main pacemaker of circadian rhythms; therefore,
to test whether presence of the SCN was necessary for
the day–night variation of postprandial TG uptake, we
performed the OFT with the radioactive tracer in SCNX
rats. As these rats are arrhythmic, once arrhythmicity was
confirmed as evaluated by their locomotor activity, the
test was performed at ZT2 and ZT14 (n = 3 per group)
and data were compared with the TG uptake reported for
intact rats from experiment 5.
Stereotactic surgeries
Bilateral SCN lesions were performed under deep
anaesthesia with a mixture of ketamine (40–80 mg kg−1)
and xylazine (5–8 mg kg−1) injected I.M. Animals were
placed in the stereotactic frame (tooth bar, ±2.5 mm;
arm, 4 deg) and electrodes (0.2 mm diameter) were
placed bilaterally in the SCN (co-ordinates: −0.2 mm
from bregma; ±0.9 mm lateral from the mid-line; and
8.2–8.6 mm below the brain surface). Bilateral SCN lesions
(SCNX) were performed with a current of 0.35 mA for
45 s in each electrode (Grass DC constant current lesion
maker). To ensure the use of only complete SCNX animals,

Suprachiasmatic nucleus mediates postprandial triglyceride uptake
we selected only animals presenting arrhythmic patterns
in general activity in LD conditions. In addition, at the
end of the experiment the completeness of the lesion
was verified histologically using staining for vasoactive
intestinal peptide (VIP; Buijs et al. 1993). Animals still
showing VIP staining were discarded from the study.
Activity recording
For behavioural monitoring, intact and SCNX rats were
placed in individual cages (45 cm × 30 cm × 35 cm)
that were positioned on plates with movement sensors, in
soundproof lockers with controlled lighting conditions.
Behavioural events were collected with a digitized system
and stored automatically at 1 min intervals for further
analysis with a system developed for our laboratory
(Acosta-Galvan et al. 2011). Analysis was carried out
with the data accumulated in 15 min intervals. For each
rat, double-plotted actograms were obtained with SPAD9
analysis based on Matlab, developed for our laboratory by
the biomedical company Omnialva (Mexico city, Mexico).
Movement counts were normalized to the proportional
percentage of the daily activity, and the mean activity
waveforms were obtained for 3–5 days.
Lipoprotein lipase activity measurements
For determination of LPL activity, rats in ZT2 and ZT14
were subjected to the fat bolus as described in the previous
section. Two hours after the fat gavage, rats were deeply
anaesthetized and killed with an overdose of sodium
pentobarbital 150 mg kg−1, I.P., and immediately after
perfused with cold saline, via the heart, to remove blood
and non-internalized TRL from the organs. Subsequently,
samples of BAT were collected and homogenized at 4°C,
(1:10) in the following buffer: 25 mM NH3, 1% Triton
X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1 mg bovine serum albumin ml−1, 5 U
heparinml−1 andonepillofproteaseinhibitors(Complete
Mini, Roche) per 50 ml buffer. After centrifugation
(10,000g, for 10 min at 4°C) the clear phase was collected
and used for LPL activity determinations.
The LPL assay was performed as previously described
(Hocquette et al. 1998; Holm et al. 2001). First,
the substrate emulsion was prepared by incorporating
3H[9,10]-triolein (Perkin-Elmer; �70 μCi) into the
Intralipid emulsion 20% (Fresenius kabi, Deerfield, IL,
USA) by sonication. Then 3 μl of the samples was
incubated with incubation medium, prepared with 5 μl
emulsion, 10 μl of heat-inactivated serum as a source of
apolipoprotein CII, 60 μl of deionized water and 105 μl of
the incubation buffer (0.3 M Tris–HCl, 0.2 M NaCl, 0.2 mg
heparin ml−1, and 120 mg bovine serum albumin ml−1
at pH 8.5) in a total volume of 200 μl. The incubation
was performed for 120 min at 25°C, and the reaction was
stopped using methanol:chloroform:heptane (34:38:28).
After centrifugation, the supernatant was transferred to
scintillation vials and counted on a TriCarb scintillation
counter (Perkin-Elmer). One milliunit of enzyme activity
corresponds to 1 nmol of fatty acid released per minute
at 25°C. The assay was within the linear range, and all
samples were assayed in triplicate.
Total RNA isolation and quantitative real-time PCR
Total RNA was prepared using TRIzol R
� (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions and the RNA quality evaluated by gel
electrophoresis. Reverse transcription (RT) reaction was
performed with 800 ng total RNA from each sample
using random primers. PCR assays for each target gene
were analysed in duplicate in a 96-well assay plate with
a Lightcyler 480 Sequence Detection System (Roche
Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN, USA), using SYBR Green
for chemical detection of the PCR products. Melting curve
analysis was carried out to ensure specific amplification.
The following PCR primers were obtained from Sigma
Aldrich: Ucp1 (forward, CCGAAACTGTACAGCGGTCT;
reverse, TGACCTTCACCACCTCTGTG), Lpl (forward,
TCTAACTGCCACTTCAAC; reverse, CCAACTCTCATA

ACGTGG; reverse, TGCCAACGGAGAGACACTTC). The
relative amounts of mRNA were calculated by using the
��Ct method, with an efficiency adjustment according
to the Pfaffl equation (Pfaffl, 2001). Tbp was used as the
housekeeping gene.
Statistical analysis
Values are expressed as means ± SD. The data were
analysed by using GraphPad Prism (version 6.03;
GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA). Data were
tested for normality using the Kolmogorov–Smirnov Z
test; if data did not exhibit a normal distribution, they were
logarithmically transformed before analysis. Two-way
ANOVAforrepeatedmeasurementswasusedtodetermine
the main effects of time of the day (ZT2 versus ZT14) and
thedifferentsamplingtimepoints.Bonferroni’scorrection
was used for multiple comparison correction. The total
area under the curve (AUC) for plasma triglycerides was
calculatedusingGraphPadPrismsoftware.Thedifferences
in the AUC, TG uptake, LPL activity and gene expression
between groups were evaluated either with Student’s
unpaired t test or with one-way ANOVA. Differences were
considered significant when P < 0.05.

Results
Experiment 1: day–night variations in postprandial TG
We evaluated the postprandial TG response curve to an
OFT over a 5 h period at the beginning of the rest phase
(day; ZT2) and at the beginning of the active phase
(night; ZT14). Two hours after the fat gavage, plasma
TGs increased up to 180 mg dl−1 at ZT2, and up to
87 mg dl−1 at ZT14 (ZT2 P < 0.0001, ZT14 P < 0.01)
whencomparedwithbaseline,andremainedelevateduntil
5 and 4 h post-gavage, respectively. At ZT2, early in the rest
phase for rodents, the peak in the TG curve was observed
2 h post-gavage, whereas the peak at ZT14 (night) was
observed 4 h after the gavage. In addition, postprandial
plasma TG concentrations at ZT2 were at least two times
higher 2 h after gavage than those at ZT14 (Fig. 1A).
The day–night differences were further corroborated by
the AUC, which was 40% lower at ZT14 (P < 0.01)
whencomparedwithZT2,indicatingthatthepostprandial
plasma TG concentration induced by the OFT clearly has
a dependence on the time of the day.

Experiment 2: day–night variations in postprandial
TG are not related to differences in chylomicron
secretion rate
To investigate whether the temporal response to the
OFT in the previous experiment was attributable to the
intestinal TG secretion rate, LPL activity was inhibited
by
I.P. injection of P407, before the fat challenge.
Triglyceride accumulation in plasma after the fat gavage
was not different between ZT2 and ZT14, during the 4 h
post-gavage (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, when a radioactive
tracer (3H-triolein) was incorporated into the fat bolus,
no difference in the plasma concentrations of the tracer
between ZT2 and ZT14 were observed, indicating that
postprandial plasma TG differences are not attributable
to day–night variations in intestinal TG secretion and
suggesting differences in their clearance.
Experiment 3: intravenous fat tolerance test
Clearance of TGs from the circulation can be attributed
to a higher uptake in tissues attributable to LPL activity
(Kersten, 2014). To support the suggestion that differences
in tissue uptake were driving day–night differences in
plasma postprandial TGs, we injected an artificial TG
emulsion I.V. Rats at ZT2 and at ZT14 showed a TG peak
5 min after the infusion. Plasma TG concentrations were
significantly lower at 15 and 30 min after infusion when
administered at ZT14 versus ZT2 (Fig. 2) and remained
lower until the end of the curve. Furthermore, the AUC
was significantly lower in the night group when compared
with the day group.

Suprachiasmatic nucleus mediates postprandial triglyceride uptake
plasma postprandial TG curves in DD conditions. In
DD, the SCN maintains its own rhythmic output but
free runs with its own period, different from but close
to 24 h (Pitrosky et al. 1999). In DD conditions at CT2,
the postprandial plasma TG curve in rats was equivalent
to the curve of rats during the day (ZT2; P = 0.97;
Fig. 3), indicating that the output of the SCN and not the
difference in light input was responsible for the observed
variations.
Experiment 5: day–night variations in postprandial
TG are mainly driven by increased uptake in skeletal
muscle and BAT at the beginning of the active phase
We next investigated which tissues or organs were
responsible for the rapid clearance. To examine this, we
performed the OFT and incorporated 3H-triolein as a
tracer. Two hours post-gavage, the BAT and the soleus
muscle of rats at ZT14 showed a two times higher uptake
of fatty acids when compared with ZT2 (Fig. 4A and B),
showinganaccelerateduptakeofTGinbothtissuesduring

a trend even until 4 h post-gavage, whereas the difference
in soleus muscle disappeared. No significant differences
were observed in TG uptake between the active and rest
phase in liver, heart or white adipose tissues. As LPL is the
rate-limitingenzymeforthehydrolysisoftheTGcorefrom
chylomicrons, LPL activity in BAT was assayed 2 h after
gavage, showing a higher activity at ZT14 when compared
with ZT2 (Fig. 5).
Experiment 6: differential uptake by skeletal muscle
and BAT are driven by the SCN
To test the role of the SCN in TG uptake, we performed this
experiment in arrhythmic SCNX rats at ZT2 and ZT14.

uptake were abolished in these rats (Fig. 6A and B);
therefore, rats of these two groups were put together
for further comparisons. As shown in Fig. 7A, SCNX
rats show no rhythmic activity patterns between day and
night. When compared with intact rats, their activity
patterns are higher from ZT2 to ZT10 and lower during
the first half of the night phase (ZT12–ZT18). Despite the
higher behavioural activity in SCNX animals between ZT2
and ZT4, when compared with intact rats (Fig. 7B), TG
uptake by BAT and soleus was equivalent to intact rats in
this interval (Fig. 6C and D), indicating that day–night
variations in TG uptake depend on the SCN, and that it is
not a response solely to the level of activity.
Expression of genes involved in TG uptake
To explore the possible cellular mechanisms that could
be responsible for the higher TG or fatty acid uptake
in the beginning of the active period, we analysed the
gene expression profile of BAT and soleus, in animals
killed 2 h after the fat gavage (ZT2 and ZT14). In BAT,
genes involved in lipoprotein metabolism (Lpl, Angptl4
and Gphibp1), fatty acid uptake (Cd36) or thermogenesis
(Ucp1) showed no significant changes between ZT2 and
ZT14 or in SCNX animals (Fig. 8A). In soleus also, no
differenceswereobservedforLplandCd36geneexpression
(Fig. 8B). In contrast, the expression in BAT of Nr1d1
(known as orphan nuclear receptor Rev-erbα), which is
a major repressor involved in the clockwork machinery,
was significantly lower during the night (ZT14) when
compared with the day (ZT2), whereas SCNX rats showed
an equivalent expression to the day (Fig. 8C).
Discussion
Postprandial dyslipidaemia, the abnormal persistence
of intestinal and hepatic lipoproteins in plasma after
each meal, makes a substantial contribution to the
population-wide burden of atherosclerotic cardiovascular
disease (Williams, 2008). Given the high incidence of
cardiovascular events observed in night workers (Vyas
et al. 2012) and the absence of knowledge about the
mechanisms behind day–night variations in postprandial
dyslipidaemia, we investigated the nature of day–night
variationsinpostprandialTGsandtheroleoftheSCN.The
present study shows that rats have day–night variations in
plasma postprandial TGs that are related to an accelerated
uptake by BAT and skeletal muscle tissue during the
beginning of the active phase and that this day–night
difference is driven by the SCN, probably through a
Rev-erbα-mediated mechanism.
Plasma TG concentrations result from production of
TRLs (hepatic and intestinal) and from clearance by
peripheral tissues. Previous studies have shown that

intestinal lipid absorption and chylomicron secretion
show diurnal variations. Clock mutant mice show an
increased intestinal absorption of lipids during the day,
which was suggested to contribute to their characteristic
hyperlipidaemia(Pan&Hussain,2009).Therefore,wefirst
hypothesized that postprandial TG differences between
day and night could be related to changes in the intestinal
physiology. On inhibition of LPL, we did not find any
difference in the TG secretion rate between the active and
rest phase. It is important to mention that although this
inhibitor is not specific to LPL (Millar et al. 2005) and
can also inhibit intestinal lipase, by delivering it I.P. we
bypass the gut entirely (Coria-Avila et al. 2007; Turner
et al. 2011), and therefore we do not expect inhibition
of intestinal fat absorption. At first, these results could
seem contradictory to previous studies (Pan et al. 2010);
however, those studies were performed in enterocytes in
vitro and in intestinal loops in vivo in order to differentiate
intestinal from stomach rhythmicity (Pan & Hussain,
2009). It is known that gastric emptying and pH changes
show rhythmic behaviour (Goo et al. 1987). Given that
we administered an intragastric gavage, it is likely that
our data result from a combination between stomach and
intestinal rhythms.
In the postprandial state, the TRL pool arises mainly
from the intestinal source, as the secretion of hepatic TRLs
is suppressed by feeding in an effort to avoid excessive
increases in blood TG concentrations (Søndergaard et al.
2012). Even though we did not assess the lipoproteins
derived from the liver after the gavage, our observations
suggest that day–night differences in postprandial TGs
are mainly attributable to differences in TG uptake by
tissues. Indeed, the results of the I.V. administration of
lipid emulsion support this. The reason why the effect in
the latter circumstance was smaller is probably related to
the fact that artificial droplets have a smaller size (similar
to chylomicron remnants), less affinity to LPL binding
and are likely to be cleared more slowly (Xiang et al.

the heart were responsible for a significant portion of
postprandialTGuptake,therewerenodifferencesbetween
the rest and active phase. Instead, BAT and soleus muscle,
although with a lower uptake, seem to be the major drivers
in the circulating postprandial TG differences observed
between day and night. During the active phase (night),
BAT and soleus have an accelerated uptake compared with
the rest phase (day), resulting in a faster clearance of TGs
from the circulation. Indeed, other studies have shown
that tissues with a lower uptake of TGs, such as the lung,
can significantly impact circulating TGs (Jun et al. 2012;
Yao et al. 2013). The LPL activity assay in BAT further
showed that the higher TG uptake in ZT14 was related
to a higher LPL activity. This result concurs with previous
findingsshowingthatinBAT,LPLactivityhasitsacrophase
during the early hours of the active phase (Benavides et al.
1998),suggestingthatthehigherTGuptakeinZT14canbe
driven by circadian changes in LPL activity. Indeed, other
studies have observed a significant correlation between
TG uptake and LPL activity in adipose tissues (Laplante
et al. 2008). These differences seem not to be driven by
an upregulation in the gene expression of Lpl, because no
significant changes were observed. This is supported by
other studies that have observed significant variations in
LPL activity despite little variation in Lpl gene expression
(Drager et al. 2012).
To the best of our knowledge, there are no reports on the
mechanisms behind day–night variations in LPL activity
in BAT and skeletal muscle. Therefore, in an attempt
to explore further the possible mechanisms regulating
TG uptake we measured the gene expression of major
proteins involved in lipoprotein metabolism (ANGPTL4
and GPIHBP1; Davies et al. 2010; Dijk & Kersten, 2014)
and in fatty acid uptake (Cd36; Goudriaan et al. 2005;
Khedoe et al. 2015). In our study, we observed no
significant differences in the expression of these genes
between the active and rest phase, nor in SCNX animals. In
contrast, we did observe day–night variations in the gene
expression of Reve-erbα, which concurs with previous
studies showing the peak of this gene in BAT at around
ZT4 (Yang et al. 2006). Rev-erbα has been proposed as
an integrator between circadian rhythms and metabolism
(Duez & Staels, 2009), linking circadian and thermogenic
networks through the regulation of BAT (Gerhart-Hines
et al. 2013), and Rev-erbα knockout mice clearly present a
deregulated lipid metabolism (Duez & Staels, 2009). Thus,
we propose that the day–night variations in TG uptake in
BAT are driven by a Rev-erbα-mediated mechanism. How
precisely Rev-erbα modulates LPL activity or TG uptake
has not yet been established.
Acute exercise can increase LPL activity in skeletal
muscle (Wang & Eckel, 2009) and thus TG uptake.

Suprachiasmatic nucleus mediates postprandial triglyceride uptake
Thus, we wondered whether the changes in behavioural
activity between the rest and the active phase were
driving day–night variation in TG uptake. Interestingly,
in spite of the fact that SCNX animals are more active
between ZT2 and ZT4, lipid tracer uptake in soleus was
equivalentbetweenSCNXandintactratsatthistimepoint,
demonstrating that the observed differences between ZT2
and ZT14 are not dependent on activity.
The results in BAT are consistent with previous
experiments pointing to this tissue as a major player in
plasma TG clearance (Bartelt et al. 2011; Khedoe et al.
2015). Activation of BAT by cold exposure accelerated
TG clearance in the postprandial state and could correct
hyperlipidaemia even in pathophysiological situations. All
our experiments were performed at sub-thermoneutrality
(22°C), so even though at this temperature there is some
activation of BAT by cold, this could not explain the
observed differences.
Brown adipose tissue activity is crucially dependent
on sympathetic input (Geerling et al. 2014; Kooijman
et al. 2015b), and the SCN drives part of the sympathetic
outflow from the brain to BAT (Bartness et al. 2001).
Moreover, Rev-erbα is a key regulator in the daily
body temperature rhythm by modulating BAT activity
(Gerhart-Hines et al. 2013). Thus, we hypothesize that the
activation of BAT is driven by an enhanced sympathetic
output of the SCN to BAT, which, via suppression of
Rev-erbα, supports the higher body temperature during
the active phase (ZT14). Indeed, the fact that gene
expression of Rev-erbα in SCNX animals is equivalent
to the rest phase (day) substantiates this hypothesis.
This is in line with results demonstrating that a
prolonged day decreased sympathetic input into BAT
and concomitantly the uptake of plasma fatty acids from
triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, by selectively inhibiting
BAT uptake (Kooijman et al. 2015a). Consequently, the
observation that TG uptake in BAT and soleus in SCNX
animals does not show an enhanced uptake at ZT14
illustrates that the SCN drives the enhanced uptake in
these tissues at ZT14.
Moreover, even though light input is the most
important cue for activation and synchronization of the
SCN, under constant darkness the postprandial plasma
TG profile at CT2 was equivalent to rats at ZT2,
demonstrating that the daytime effect on postprandial TG
is independent of light input and, as already mentioned,
of behavioural activity and thus relies on SCN output,
which was confirmed by the lesion results. Taken together,
these results provide evidence that during the rest
phase the postprandial clearance of TGs is slower and
may provide a temporal window for accumulation of
atherosclerotic plaques. Indeed, it was recently suggested
that activation of BAT can combat hyperlipidaemia
and atherosclerosis (Hoeke et al. 2016). As rodents are
nocturnal animals, the daytime results of these animals are
thought to be equivalent to night in humans. Thus, this
day–night variation in TG metabolism provides a possible
explanation for the increased risk of cardiovascular
diseases seen in night workers who have shifted meal
patterns towards the night. In these individuals, increased
postprandial TG in response to food intake during the rest
phase may contribute to the development of dyslipidaemia
and the formation of an atherosclerotic lesion. Here, we
demonstrated that BAT showed not only an accelerated
but also a higher uptake of fatty acids during the active
phase when compared with the rest phase.
Conclusion
The present study shows that differences in postprandial
TGs between day and night are essentially related to a
difference in TG clearance, mainly driven by BAT and
skeletal muscle uptake. This differential uptake is driven
by the SCN, probably through a Rev-erbα-mediated
mechanism, and does not depend on light or intensity
of activity.
As postprandial TG concentrations are an important
factor in the progress of atherogenesis, these results
may have potential implications for the aetiology of
cardiovascular diseases in the context of inadequate
feeding times, shifted towards the rest phase, that
commonly occur in westernized countries (late-night
dinners) and in night workers.
