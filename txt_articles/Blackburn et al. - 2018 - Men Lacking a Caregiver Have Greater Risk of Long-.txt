Abstract
Background/Objectives—Social support can prevent or delay long-term nursing home 
placement (NHP). The purpose of our study was to understand how the availability of a caregiver 
can impact NHP following ischemic stroke, and how this differentially affects subgroups.
Design—Nested cohort study
Setting—Nationally-based REasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke 
(REGARDS) study
Participants—Stroke survivors aged 65 to 100 (n = 256 men, n = 304 women)
Measurements—Data were from Medicare claims January 2003–December 2013 and 
REGARDS baseline interviews conducted January 2003–October 2007. Caregiver support was 
measured by asking, “If you had a serious illness or became disabled, do you have someone who 
would be able to provide care for you on an on-going basis?” Diagnosis of ischemic stroke was 
derived from inpatient claims. NHP was determined using a validated claims algorithm for stays 
≥100 days. Risk was estimated using Cox regression.
Results—Within 5 years of stroke, 119 (21.3%) were observed to have NHP. Risk of NHP was 
greater among those lacking available caregivers (log-rank p <0.01). After adjustment for

 covariates, lacking an available caregiver increased the risk of NHP following stroke within 1 year 
by 70% (HR1-year 1.70, 95% CI1-year 0.97–2.99) and within 5 years by 68% (HR5-year 1.68, 95% 
CI1-year 1.10–2.58). The effect of caregiver availability on NHP was limited to men (HR5-year 3.15, 
95% CI5-year 1.49–6.67).
Conclusion—Among men over 65 years old surviving ischemic stroke, the lack of an available 
caregiver is associated with triple the risk of NHP within 5 years.

Introduction
As a leading cause of long-term disability, stroke can be devastating—permanently altering 
the ability to care for one’s self and thereby limiting the ability to live independently.1–3 In 
recent years, stroke mortality has declined due in part to improved treatments and other 
medical advancements.4 Despite these advances to lower incidence and improve survival, 
stroke remains a significant cause of impairments requiring some form of long-term care. 
Nearly 70% of those with severe stroke will require nursing home care, especially women 
and those who are older at stroke onset.5–7
When it comes to long-term care, Americans prefer to remain at home with family support 
rather than institutionalization.8 In fact, only 29% of adults say they are willing to move into 
a nursing home if they become disabled, compared with 75% who would rather rely on an 
informal caregiver.9 Although nursing home placement (NHP) is inevitable for some, social 
support can substitute or delay this outcome.5,10 While most individuals believe they have 
someone who can take care of them if they become ill or disabled, it is not known whether 
this affects NHP.11 The purpose of our study was to better understand how social support 
affects NHP following stroke. With the demand for long-term care services expected to rise 
as the U.S. population ages and workforce and nursing home bed shortfalls predicted, 
understanding factors associated with NHP and encouraging community-living is a critical 
public health challenge.12–14 We hypothesized that lacking social support, specifically 
lacking a caregiver, would be an important risk factor of NHP. Furthermore, we investigated 
whether population subgroups may be especially vulnerable, including men and those with 
low income.

 Methods
Participants
We conducted a nested cohort study within the REasons for Geographic and Racial 
Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study. REGARDS was designed to investigate causes of 
regional and black-white disparities in stroke mortality with oversampling of blacks and 
residents of the Stroke Belt.15 A detailed description of the sampling, recruitment, and 
telephone interviewing procedures for REGARDS have been described elsewhere.16 Briefly, 
using a commercially available list, REGARDS recruited participants aged 45 years or older, 
English-speaking, community-dwelling, and free of medical conditions preventing follow-
up. Baseline interviews and in-home visits were conducted from January 2003 through 
October 2007, resulting in 30,239 participants. Using a computer-assisted telephone 
interview, interviewers obtained demographics, medical history and risk factors.
We analyzed data from the participants’ baseline interviews linked with Medicare claims 
data. The methods for the linkage are described in detail elsewhere.17 Briefly, linkages were 
conducted using participants’ social security numbers with matches confirmed by sex and 
birthdate. Data were extracted from multiple Medicare files, including the beneficiary 
summary file, inpatient file, outpatient file, skilled nursing facility (SNF) file, and carrier 
file. Our analysis included participants hospitalized for ischemic stroke between September 
1, 2003 and September 30, 2013. Ischemic stroke was identified from the inpatient file by 
International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision diagnosis codes: 433.x1, 434.x1, 
and 436. These codes have been validated in the primary diagnosis position to have a 
positive predictive value of 92.6% and specificity of 99.8%.18 Using the codes in any 
position, the positive predictive value has been shown to be 79.5% and the specificity 99.7%.
19 Due to concerns with low sensitivity using only primary diagnosis (59.5%), we included 
diagnosis codes in the top three positions. 18,19 In order to ensure participants’ claims data 
were complete and they were community-dwelling, a “look-back” period of 60 days prior to 
stroke admission date was constructed (this corresponds to the Medicare SNF benefit, which 
renews after 60 days without a SNF claim). During the look-back period, participants for 
this study were required to have maintained traditional Medicare coverage, defined as parts 
A and B, without managed care (i.e. Medicare Advantage plans), and were excluded if they 
had a SNF claim during this period. A “look-forward” period was constructed beginning 
with the date of discharge following stroke through 100 days. This corresponds to the 
minimum period required to identify NHP (described below). Participants were excluded if 
they lost coverage, enrolled in managed care, or died during this period. Among 20,403 
REGARDS participants linked to Medicare claims, 960 with ischemic stroke were identified 
(1,291 events). Figure 1 details exclusion criteria, which included 128 whose strokes 
occurred prior to baseline interview, 40 participants that died during hospitalization, 58 
participants who did not meet coverage criteria, 46 participants that were <65 or >110 years 
of age, and 14 participants with SNF stays. During the look-forward period, 50 participants 
were excluded due to their Medicare coverage and 64 participants died. The final analysis 
considered 560 participants.

 Measures
The primary outcome of interest was time-to-NHP following hospital discharge for ischemic 
stroke. We defined NHP as a stay exceeding 100 days, which corresponds to depletion of the 
Medicare SNF benefit. A validated, claims-based algorithm was used to identify NHP. 20 
The algorithm relies on SNF claims paired with physician point of service claims for 
custodial care observed consecutively for at least 100 days and has 87.0% sensitivity and 
96.0% specificity.20 The date of NHP was considered date of admission for SNF stays that 
exceeded 100 days. Time-to-NHP began the day after hospital discharge until whichever 
came first: NHP, eligible Medicare coverage lost, death, or the end of available follow-up 
data (December 31, 2013). Analyses were restricted to time-to-NHP of 1 and 5 years.
The primary exposure variable was lack of an available caregiver, determined from the 
baseline interview question, “if you had a serious illness or became disabled, do you have 
someone who would be able to provide care for you on an on-going basis?” Among those 
with an available caregiver, the relationship (i.e. spouse/partner, child, sibling, other family, 
other) was collected. Other measures of social support assessed included living alone, 
marital status, and the number of relatives participants “feel close to,” categorized as ≤3, 4–
5, or ≥6.
Other baseline characteristics were selected a priori including race, sex, and income because 
of known associations with NHP.1,21 Annual household income was collected in increments 
and based on the distribution, categorized as <$20,000, $20,000 to $50,000, and ≥$50,000. 
Participants who refused to state income had different distributions of characteristics, 
including NHP, from those with known incomes. The main analysis was conducted with this 
group separately. In stratified analyses, low income was defined as annual household income 
<$20,000 compared to all other incomes, wherein this category was statistically significant 
in the main analysis. Additionally, due to similar effect sizes and direction, declining to state 
income was combined with the income group ≥$20,000 per year for stratified analyses to 
simplify the interpretation. Sensitivity analyses combining and excluding those declining to 
state income had similar results. We also conducted sensitivity analyses including dual 
Medicare and Medicaid eligibility that produced similar results. Because using the income 
variable provides more information and low income was highly correlated with dual-
eligibility (Pearson’s ρ=0.406, p<0.001), our final analyses adjust only for income.
Due to the increased risk of NHP associated with dementia and/or other forms of cognitive 
impairment, claims data were used to identify diagnoses of dementia and dementia-like 
diseases including Alzheimer’s Disease (hereafter “cognitive impairment”).1,21 We used 
International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes detailed by Taylor et al.22 
shown to have 85.0% sensitivity and 89.0% specificity in identifying dementia. Because the 
severity of the stroke is unavailable from claims, two proxy measures were considered.23 
First, inpatient length of stay categorized as ≤3 days, 4–10 days, and ≥11 days according to 
the variable’s distribution. Second, patient discharge status after the stroke hospitalization 
was grouped into four categories: “discharged to an inpatient rehabilitation facility;” 
“discharged home,” including home, home health, home with hospice, and left against 
medical advice; “discharged to SNF;” and “all other statuses” which includes long-term care 
hospitals, or other facilities that are not SNFs.

 Statistical Analysis
Descriptive analyses of the nested cohort included frequencies and mean values, reported 
among those with NHP compared to those without. A Kaplan-Meier curve of the estimated 
survival function was calculated to compare measures of social support. We used Cox 
regression to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) of 
NHP following stroke within 1 year and 5 years from discharge, adjusting for covariates. 
Evidence of association was determined by an a priori α level of 0.05. Log-log plots were 
examined for deviations from the proportional hazards assumption. To assess the interaction 
effects of caregiver availability at levels of sex and income, Cox regression models were 
estimated with individual interactions among these variables. Evidence of interaction was 
determined by an a priori α level of 0.10 and further investigated through stratification. 
Analyses were performed using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) and Stata 14 (Stata 
Corporation, College Station, TX).
Results
Among 560 eligible participants with ischemic stroke, the average age was 77.0 (±7.1) 
years, 304 (54.3%) were women, 312 (55.7%) were white, 68 (12.1%) were observed to 
have NHP within 1 year and 119 (21.3%) within 5 years of discharge (Table 1). Those with 
NHP within 5 years more frequently had no available caregiver, lower income, cognitive 
impairment, longer hospital stays, and discharge to SNF (p<0.05). Having no available 
caregiver was the only statistically significant social support measure tested, with 27.6% 
among those with NHP lacking a caregiver compared to 16.1% who were community-
dwelling (p=0.0040).
The unadjusted risk of NHP was greater among those lacking an available caregiver, log-
rank p=0.0059 (Supplemental Figure S1). After adjustment for covariates, lacking an 
available caregiver increased the risk of NHP following stroke within 1 year by 70% 
(HR1-year 1.70, 95% CI1-year 0.97–2.99) and within 5 years by 68% (HR5-year 1.68, 95% 
CI1-year 1.10–2.58) (Table 2). Predictors of NHP were similar across follow-up times, with 
some exceptions. The largest risk of NHP was discharge statuses other than home, including 
discharge to SNF (HR1-year 8.00, 95% CI1-year 3.89–16.46; HR5-year 4.53, 95% CI5-year 
2.78–7.36) and inpatient rehabilitation (HR1-year 6.07, 95% CI1-year 2.82–13.06; HR5-year 
3.36, 95% CI5-year 1.96–5.76), followed by cognitive impairment (HR1-year 2.84, 95% 
CI1-year 1.57–5.13; HR5-year 3.45, 95% CI5-year 2.21–5.38). Although consistent in direction 
and magnitude, length of hospital stay was statistically significant only within 5 years. 
Compared to hospital stays of ≤3 days, the risk of NHP increased for stays of 4–10 days 
(HR5-year 1.76, 95% CI5-year 1.09–2.85) and ≥11 days (HR5-year 2.20, 95% CI5-year 1.19–
4.06).
Only the interaction between caregiver availability and sex (p =0.0540) was observed below 
our a priori threshold for further investigation of effect modification, thus excluding low 
income (p =0.2370). Lacking an available caregiver increased the risk of NHP among men 
(HR 3.15, 95% CI 1.49–6.67), but not women (HR 1.37, 95% CI 0.80–2.35; Table 3). 
Among men, low income (<$20,000) increased the risk of NHP compared to incomes of ≥
$50,000 (HR 3.12, 95% CI 1.15–8.43). Men and women differed by the relationship to

 available caregiver, such that women identified a child (i.e. son or daughter) most frequently 
(71.6%) whereas men identified their spouse (70.5%). Comparable Cox models determined 
that type of caregiver was not a statistically significant predictor of NHP following stroke 
(available upon request).
Discussion
Our study finds men aged 65 years and older, who could not identify a potentially available 
caregiver prior to having a stroke, had greater risk of NHP following stroke than men with a 
caregiver. This was the only social support measure tested with a statistically significant 
effect, and thus a stronger predictor of NHP than marital status, living alone, and having 
relatives or close friends. Although the lack of a caregiver was statistically significant in the 
full sample, the risk of NHP was non-uniform; we observed the effect statistically significant 
only in men.
Our findings are consistent with previous research. Older adults with higher levels of social 
support, including the availability of a caregiver, have been shown to have better outcomes 
following stroke and have lower risk of institutionalization.5,21,24–30 Lacking a caregiver is 
known to be more common among men.31 However, men are also less likely to use formal 
services.32,33 For many men, it is often assumed their spouse can serve as a caregiver 
(approximately 71% within the REGARDS cohort).11,34 Perceptions of caregiver availability 
are different between men and women, such that older women may ignore some factors in 
judging the availability of potential caregivers.11,35 Although women more often act as 
caregivers, the effect of having a caregiver appears less important compared to men. Women 
are generally less reliant on spouses for caregiving than men and better connected to non-
spousal caregivers, which may explain the difference in NHP risk compared to men.11
Counter to previous research, we observed no association between marital status, living 
along, or feeling close to relatives and the risk of NHP following stroke. While these 
variables are proxy measures of having social support or a potential caregiver, our analysis 
measured caregiver availability directly and thus was less ambiguous. Our findings, which 
are specific to men, could be influenced by differences in how men and women estimate the 
ability of a family member or spouse to take on the role of caregiver—perceiving they do not 
have a caregiver when they do, or vice versa. Although we observed no effects specific to the 
available caregiver’s relation and NHP, there are likely additional familial dynamics 
predisposing men lacking caregivers to have increased risk of NHP, such divorce or the sexes 
of their children, that warrant further investigation.
We also observed low income men had an increased risk of NHP. Low income status likely 
coincides with the inability to pay for formal services and is highly correlated with Medicaid 
eligibility. Our measure of income was taken prior to stroke, and therefore is not a reflection 
of spend down or destitution resulting from the institutionalization.36 For low income men 
without caregivers, NHP may be the only option. It is unclear how home and community-
based services (HCBS), specifically Medicaid waiver programs, impact this population. Data 
were not available to assess use of HCBS within REGARDS. Future research may be able to 
elucidate whether HCBS can delay NHP for older men with low income who lack

 caregivers. As the aging U.S. population becomes less reliant on unpaid caregiving and 
increasingly uses paid caregiving, expanding the capacity of HCBS and understanding long-
term outcomes will be critical.37–39
Some important strengths of our study are the use of a population-based prospective cohort 
study linked to Medicare claims. Despite these strengths, our study should be interpreted in 
light of some limitations. Social support measures, including caregiver availability, were 
assessed in REGARDS during baseline interviews but any changes over time were not 
captured and thus could not be analyzed as time-dependent variables. We believe it more 
common to lose potential caregivers rather than gain, resulting in bias towards the null. We 
investigated single item measures of social support, and thus our findings may not represent 
index measures incorporating multiple items. No measure of stroke severity is available in 
Medicare claims, nor do we know specifically what precipitated NHP. Likewise, we did not 
have information regarding functional limitations which are associated with nursing home 
placement. Our cohort consisted of only community-dwelling participants and we included 
hospital length of stay and discharge status as proxy measures of stroke severity, however we 
acknowledge this is inferior to formal measurement.23 Our claims-based algorithm to 
identify stroke may be subject to misclassification. In an effort to determine how this may 
have impacted our findings, a sensitivity analysis was conducted using strokes identified by 
the REGARDS study team and adjudicated by an expert panel of clinicians. We found that 
95% of our sample was in agreement as an ischemic stroke; however, 50% of claims-based 
strokes were not reviewed by the REGARDS team. Reasons include medical records were 
unavailable, coding errors, diagnoses not indicative of an incident stroke. Nonetheless, 
replicating our main analysis among 282 strokes identified with both methods estimated 
qualitatively similar results—HR5-year for available caregiver was 2.69 (95% CI5-year 1.33–
5.44)—bolstering the robustness of our findings in the claims-only sample. While our 
income measure represents income at baseline when the participant was community-
dwelling and prior to their stroke, we could not assess the relationship to wealth, such as 
owning a home or net worth, which are important factors in determining future Medicaid 
eligibility for long-term care. Our stratified analysis reduced the sample size considerably. 
This limited our ability to further explore important subgroups. Finally, our sample was 
limited to REGARDS participants who were Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years and older 
with fee for service coverage and may not generalize to younger populations or those with 
managed plans.
Conclusion
Following a stroke, men who lack a caregiver have a greater risk of NHP than men with a 
caregiver. Our findings suggest clinicians remain cognizant of the important role caregivers 
play for older adults to remain independent, in particular those most vulnerable including 
men lacking caregivers. Opportunities exist for clinicians to educate and counsel families on 
the expectations of care needs and caregiving following stroke, as well as recognize the need 
for formal services and assist in aligning patients with resources. Future research efforts 
should focus on how long-term care policies, in particular those pertaining to HCBS, can 
mitigate the risk of NHP following stroke. Moreover, identifying the specific needs of 
individuals that require NHP, namely men, and the deficiencies of caregivers will enable

 better alignment of services to permit continued community residence where appropriate and 
desired. Although beyond the scope of our current analysis, a better understanding is needed 
comparing additional outcomes, including quality of life, among individuals who have 
caregivers compared with those who enter nursing homes.
