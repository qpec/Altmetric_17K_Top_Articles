E
lectronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) are novel 
devices that are designed to mimic the 
physical and tactile experience of conven-
tional cigarettes while producing a smoke-free 
vapour. They have quickly gained popularity 
despite limited evidence regarding the health risks 
associated with their use and a lack of regulation.1 
In addition, existing literature about e-cigarettes 
suggests that they may not be effective for achiev-
ing smoking reduction or cessation, a use for 
which they are often marketed.1–3 Given their 
physical similarities to conventional cigarettes, 
there are concerns that the increasing use of 
e-cigarettes may result in the “renormalization” of 
cigarette smoking.4,5 Previous studies have sug-
gested that use of e-cigarettes among adolescents 
and young adults may be associated with use of 
and exposure to tobacco.1,6,7
Rates of the use of e-cigarettes at least once 
among high school students in the United States 
have increased annually.6,8 Among adolescents in 
Canada, use of e-cigarettes is now more common

Background: Use of electronic cigarettes 
(e-cigarettes) among adolescents has not been 
fully described, in particular their motivations 
for using them and factors associated with use. 
We sought to evaluate the frequency, motiva-
tions and associated factors for e-cigarette use 
among adolescents in Ontario.
Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study 
in the Niagara region of Ontario, Canada, involv-
ing universal screening of students enrolled in 
grade 9 in co-operation with the Heart Niagara 
Inc. Healthy Heart Schools’ Program (for the 
2013–2014 school year). We used a questionnaire 
to assess cigarette, e-cigarette and other tobacco 
use, and self-rated health and stress. We assessed 
household income using 2011 Canadian census 
data by matching postal codes to census code.
Results: Of 3312 respondents, 2367 answered 
at least 1 question in the smoking section of 
the questionnaire (1274 of the 2367 respon-
dents [53.8%] were male, with a mean [SD] 
age of 14.6 [0.5] yr) and 2292 answered the 
question about use of e-cigarettes. Most 
respondents to the questions about use of 
e-cigarettes (n = 1599, 69.8%) had heard of
e-cigarettes, and 380 (23.8%) of these respon-
dents had learned about them from a store 
sign or display. Use of e-cigarettes was 
reported by 238 (10.4%) students. Most of the 
respondents who reported using e-cigarettes 
(171, 71.9%) tried them because it was “cool/
fun/new,” whereas 14 (5.8%) reported using 
them for smoking reduction or cessation. Male 
sex, recent cigarette or other tobacco use, fam-
ily members who smoke and friends who 
smoke were strongly associated with reported 
e-cigarette use. Reported use of e-cigarettes
was associated with self-identified fair/poor
health rating (odds ratio [OR] 1.9 (95% confi-
dence interval [CI] 1.2–3.0), p < 0.001), high
stress level (OR 1.7 (95% CI 1.1–2.7), p < 0.001)
and lower mean (33.4 [8.4] × $1000 v.
36.1 [10.7] × $1000, p = 0.001) and median
[interquartile range] (26.2 [5.6] × $1000 v. 28.1
[5.7] × $1000) household incomes.
Interpretation: Use of e-cigarettes is common 
among adolescents in the Niagara region and is 
associated with sociodemographic features. 
Engaging in seemingly exciting new behaviours 
appears to be a key motivating factor rather 
than smoking cessation.

than cigarette use.9 However, questions still remain 
regarding the motivations and factors associated 
with e-cigarette use among adolescents. Therefore, 
we sought to evaluate the frequency, motivations 
and associated factors for use of e-cigarettes by 
students in grade 9 who were undergoing universal 
school-based screening for cardiovascular risk fac-
tors in the Niagara region in Ontario.
Methods
Setting, participants and study design
We conducted a cross-sectional, school-based 
study of grade 9 students (aged 14–15 yr) in the 
Niagara region of Ontario during the 2013–2014 
academic school year. We undertook this study in 
co-operation with the Heart Niagara Inc. Healthy 
Heart Schools’ Program, a curriculum-enrichment 
program that provides personalized education 
about cardiometabolic risk and healthy lifestyle 
behaviours, and individualized testing for cardio-
vascular risk factors to students in the classroom 
setting. This program performs universal screen-
ing annually for students enrolled in grade 9 in the 
Niagara region. The methodology of this program 
was described previously.10,11
We obtained written consent from parents 
and written assent from students to participate 
in the assessment.
We provided students with questionnaires 
that were to be completed at home before each 
school’s predetermined screening day. The 
front page of the questionnaire contained the 
consent form for parents to complete. The first 
section of the questionnaire was an assessment 
of family history of cardiometabolic disease 
(the only section that would require parental 
assistance to complete). The student was 
expected to complete the rest of the question-
naire on their own.
For the smoking and tobacco portion of the 
questionnaire, students were asked to select only 1 
option for each question. Questions for this sec-
tion included “Have you ever taken at least one 
puff from an electronic cigarette?” and “If yes, 
why did you try an e-cigarette?” (options: “a. It’s 
cool/fun/something new; b. For the buzz; c. To 
help me quit smoking; d. To help me smoke less; 
e. To help me when I’m not allowed to smoke”). 
Regarding cigarette smoking, students were asked 
“Do you smoke now?” and “Think about the last 
30 days. Did you smoke a cigarette, even a puff?” 
Students were also asked questions about their fre-
quency of smoking, if they had used other forms 
of tobacco (e.g., cigars, cigarillos and water 
pipes), their exposure to smoke in the home, 
whether they had family members who smoked, 
whether their friends smoked and their knowledge 
of the detrimental effects of smoking. We adapted 
these questions from the Canadian Tobacco, Alco-
hol, and Drugs Use Survey,12 Ontario Student 
Drug Use and Health Survey,13 Canadian Tobacco 
Use Monitoring Survey14 and the Propel Centre 
for Population Health Impact (youth respondents 
questionnaire template).15 We also asked ques-
tions about self-perceived health and stress levels.
We recorded the residence postal codes of the 
students and, through a link with data from the 
2011 Canadian Census,16 we estimated household 
income. Completed questionnaires were returned 
to Heart Niagara Inc. during that particular 
school’s designated Healthy Heart Schools’ Pro-
gram day. Questionnaires did not need to be 
completed in their entirety to be included for data 
analysis. Teachers and other school employees 
did not have access to the individual responses.
Outcomes
Our main outcome for this study was to evaluate 
the prevalence of and motivations for using 
e-cigarettes among students in the Niagara 
region, and the sociodemographic associations 
with e-cigarette use, including concomitant 
tobacco use, use of tobacco by family and 
friends, self-rated health and stress levels, and 
socioeconomic status.
Data analysis
We reported the data either as means with stan-
dard deviations, medians with interquartile ranges 
or frequencies, as appropriate, based on the type 
and distribution of the data. We used multiple 
imputation to account for missing values. Specifi-
cally, we created 100 imputed data sets and con-
ducted logistic regression analysis to quantify the 
association between e-cigarette use and prespeci-
fied risk factors in terms of odds ratios (ORs). 
Some of the risk factors we considered included 
sex, home smoking environment, smoking status 
of responders, family members and friends, and 
self-reported health and stress levels. We used 
2-sample t tests to assess the association between 
income estimates and e-cigarette use.
All statistical analyses assumed a signifi-
cance of 5% and were performed using SAS 
version 9.4 (SAS Institute).
Ethics approval
Heart Niagara Inc. received formal ethics 
approval from the research ethics committees of 
both the Niagara Catholic District School Board 
and the District School Board of Niagara. We 
obtained approval for retrospective data analysis 
of deidentified data provided by Heart Niagara 
Inc. from the Research Ethics Board of The Hos-
pital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ont.

Results
In the 2013–2014 school year, there were 
4390 students enrolled in grade 9 in the Niagara 
region, 4109 received a questionnaire, 3312 sub-
mitted a questionnaire, 2367 answered at least 1 
question in the smoking section of the question-
naire (response rate of 57.6%) and 2292 
answered the e-cigarette use section (Table 1). 
We found no significant difference between the 
2367 students who answered at least 1 question 
in the smoking section of the questionnaire and 
the 945 students who did not answer at least 1 
question (Appendix 1, available at www.cmaj.ca/
lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.151169/-/DC1).
Sixty-six (2.8%) students reported cigarette 
use during the previous 30 days, and 174 (7.6%) 
had used cigarillos, smokeless tobacco or water 
pipes at least once (Table 1). Of 2321 respon-
dents to the environment question, 1201 (51.7%) 
had family members who smoked and 811 
(35.3%) had friends who smoked (Appendix 2, 
available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/
doi:10.1503/cmaj.151169/-/DC1). Of 2278 
respondents, 238 (10.4%) reported using 
e-cigarettes. Of these, 134 (56.3%) reported 
using them once, whereas 79 (33.2%) reported 
using them “a few times.” The most common 
reason for trying e-cigarettes was that they were 
“cool/fun/something new” (n = 171, 71.8%), 
whereas 9 (3.8%) and 5 (2.1%) respondents 
reported using them to quit smoking or smoke 
less, respectively (Figure 1). Forty-six students 
reported smoking cigarettes during the last 
30 days and reported using e-cigarettes. Of these 
respondents, 22 (47.8%) used them because they 
were “cool/fun/something new,” whereas 15 
(32.6%) respondents used e-cigarettes to help 
them quit smoking, smoke less or to help when 
they were not allowed to smoke.
Male sex, previous tobacco use, having fam-
ily members who smoke and having friends who 
smoke were all significantly associated with hav-
ing used e-cigarettes (Figure 2, Table 2). Stu-
dents who self-identified as currently smoking 
had the strongest association with using e-ciga-
rettes (OR 12.1, 95% CI 6.6–22.4). Among stu-
dents who reported smoking cigarettes during 
the last 30 days (n = 61), 41 (67.2%) had 
reported using e-cigarettes; among students who 
reported not smoking during the last 30 days 
(n = 2194), only 193 (8.8%) had reported using 
e-cigarettes (p < 0.001). Conversely, among 
those respondents who reported using e-cigarettes 
(n = 234), 41 (17.5%) reported smoking ciga-
rettes during the last 30 days compared with 20 
of 2001 (1.0%) respondents who reported never 
using e-cigarettes (p < 0.001). Reported use of 
e-cigarettes was associated with lower self-
reported health rating, higher self-reported 
stress level and lower estimated household 
income (i.e., mean [SD] (33.4 [8.4] × $1000 v. 
36.1 [10.7] × $1000, p = 0.001) and median 
[interquartile range] (26.2 [5.6] × $1000 v. 
28.1 [5.7] × $1000) household incomes) (Appen-
dix 3, available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/
doi:10.1503/cmaj.151169/-/DC1). 
Interpretation
We found that most respondents (n = 1599) to 
the survey were aware of e-cigarettes and 238 
(10.4%) had used them previously. Most users 
of e-cigarettes did so because they were “cool/
fun/new,” whereas only a few used them for 
smoking cessation. E-cigarette use was more 
common among male respondents and strongly 
associated with cigarette use, other tobacco use 
and tobacco use among family members and 
friends. Use of e-cigarettes was associated with 
lower self-identified health level, greater stress 
level and a lower estimated household income, 
which suggests that e-cigarette use may have 
some key associations that may help to identify 
adolescents at risk.

The popularity of e-cigarettes has increased 
in recent years,17 including among youth. Previ-
ous data from Canada showed use rates in ado-
lescents and young adults that ranged from 15% 
to 20%.9,18,19 In our study, the lower use rate of 
10.4% may be due to our assessment of 
younger adolescents (aged 14–15 yr). While 
e-cigarettes are frequently used as devices for 
smoking cessation in adults,3,20–22 we found 
most students in our survey (including 47.8% 
of those who recently smoked cigarettes) were 
motivated by the “cool/fun/something new” 
features of e-cigarettes. A survey involving 
adolescents in Hawaii similarly found their 
motivations to be curiosity and exploration,23

e-cigarettes found only 10% were motivated by 
curiosity.3,21 Thus, motivations for use may dif-
fer between adolescents and adults.
We found strong associations between e- 
cigarette use and recent cigarette smoking, a 
finding that has been shown both in adults8,24,25 
and youth.6,8,18,19,26 Despite these strong associa-
tions, we found 82.5% of respondents who had 
used e-cigarettes had not smoked cigarettes dur-
ing the previous 30 days. Two recent longitudinal 
studies involving adolescents and young adults 
showed significantly increased tobacco uptake 
among those who used e-cigarettes compared 
with those who had never used them.27,28 Further 
studies are required to assess whether e-cigarette 
use is a contributing factor toward increased 
future tobacco uptake among youth.
Use of e-cigarettes was greater among male 
respondents, a finding that has been noted previ-
ously.6,7,18,26 Use was also strongly associated with 
having family members and friends who smoked. 
Cardenas and colleagues similarly noted that liv-
ing with people who smoke was associated with 
increased awareness and use of e-cigarettes.7 We 
found e-cigarette use to be associated with lower 
estimated household income. Two previous stud-
ies showed use to be associated with lower educa-
tion,19,25 whereas a study involving Canadian 
youth found having more spending money was 
associated with e-cigarette use,26 and a study of 
adults noted greater use among those with greater 
incomes.2 Further studies are required to evaluate 
the associations between e-cigarette use and 
socioeconomic status.
We found strong associations between use of 
e-cigarettes and worsened perceived ratings of 
health and stress levels. Future studies will be 
required to further explore this novel finding.
Limitations
Our study had a number of limitations. 
Because it was cross-sectional, we derived 
associations rather than causations. We admin-
istered the questionnaire in only 1 region; 
therefore, the results may not be generalizable 
to the rest of Canada. However, census data 
suggest that, other than immigrant/ethnic dis-
tributions in the Niagara region population 
(lower proportion in the Niagara region com-
pared with the distribution in Ontario), the 
population distribution is quite similar to the 
broader Ontario population.29,30 We evaluated 
use of cigarettes during the previous 30 days 
rather than rates of ever having used cigaretes. 
Although the questionnaire was structured such 
that parental involvement was only required at 
the beginning (consent and family history 
assessment), it is possible that parents may 
have been able to see the students’ responses. 
This may have resulted in underreporting and 
may have contributed to our low response rate. 
Finally, use of residential postal codes and cen-
sus data may have been inaccurate at the indi-
vidual level.
Conclusion
Use of e-cigarettes is common among students 
enrolled in grade 9 in the Niagara region and is 
associated with numerous potential risk factors, 
including exposure to use of tobacco by family 
members and friends, and personal tobacco use. 
Smoking reduction and cessation do not appear to 
be motivating factors for the use of e-cigarettes 
among these respondents. Adolescents in this 
population appear to be motivated by the appeal 
of trying something new. Future studies will be 
required to assess the short- and long-term health 
impact of e-cigarettes and whether they play a 
role in the adoption of future tobacco use. Our 
findings support the ongoing implementation of 
strict regulations to help reduce e-cigarette use 
among adolescents.
