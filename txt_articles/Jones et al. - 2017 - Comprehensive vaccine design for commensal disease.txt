Commensal organisms with the potential to cause disease pose a challenge in developing treatment options.
Using the example featured in this study, pneumococcal disease begins with Streptococcus pneumoniae colonization,
followed by triggering events that prompt the release of a virulent subpopulation of bacteria. Current vaccines focus
on colonization prevention, which poses unintended consequences of serotype niche replacement. In this study, non-
covalent colocalization of two classes of complementary antigens, one to prevent the colonization of the most
aggressive S. pneumoniae serotypes and another to restrict virulence transition, provides complete vaccine effec-
tiveness in animal subjects and the most comprehensive coverage of disease reported to date. As a result, the
proposed vaccine formulation offers universal pneumococcal disease prevention with the prospect of effectively
managing a disease that afflicts tens to hundreds of millions globally. The approach more generally puts forth a
balanced prophylactic treatment strategy in response to complex commensal-host dynamics.
INTRODUCTION
Commensal microorganisms generally serve a symbiotic relationship
with the inhabited host. However, under certain circumstances, a
transition to virulence can prompt disease from a normally benign
commensal. This poses a question of whether a therapy should prevent
initial colonization, thus not only eliminating any potential for fu-
ture disease but also removing any benefit (either direct or indirect)
provided by commensal establishment, or whether a therapy should
retain colonization (and any associated benefit) while targeting the
process of virulence transition. This dilemma is well represented by
ongoing vaccination efforts to address pneumococcal disease.
Pneumococcal disease is a major global infectious disease threat that
affects millions worldwide, particularly the young, the elderly, and the
resource-limited (1–3). Disease outcomes include pneumonia, bactere-
mia, meningitis, and otitis media (middle ear infection) (4–6). As intro-
duced generally above, treating this disease is challenging because of the
scope of infection and the steps of disease progression.
More specifically, human colonization with the Streptococcus
pneumoniae bacteria responsible for pneumococcal disease is nearly
universal (7). For example, colonization occurs in more than 95% of
children in the first few years of life (8, 9). The composition of colo-
nization is complicated by >95 different serotypes of S. pneumoniae,
differentiated by the polysaccharide content coating the bacterial cell
(10). Current vaccines harvest, purify, and combine the surface capsu-
lar polysaccharides (CPSs) of S. pneumoniae serotypes associated with
aggressive invasive infection (11). The approach has been effective at
minimizing initial colonization, enabling herd immunity, and re-
ducing the disease (12).
However, the progression of pneumococcal disease requires more
than colonization. Upon acquisition, S. pneumoniae establishes residence
in the nasopharynx as an asymptomatic biofilm (13, 14). In other
words, S. pneumoniae represents an upper respiratory tract commensal.
Disease occurs upon biofilm dissemination, often prompted by dis-
ruptive events (such as viral infection) that spur a subset of bacteria
to become virulent (fig. S1) (15). Upon transition, these bacteria break
free from the biofilm, spread to the lungs, blood, middle ear, and other
locations, and cause the aforementioned disease types (16). When
viewed from this perspective, preventing colonization through current
vaccine options serves as an upstream route to eliminating subsequent
disease progression.
However, limiting colonization is only possible for the 13 to 23
serotypes covered by current vaccines, which fall well short of the >95
serotypes thus far identified (17). Hence, eliminating colonization
prevents disease from certain serotypes; but it also creates the potential
for the unintended consequence of an expanded niche in the naso-
pharynx for the remaining serotypes to establish residence and progress
to virulence (18, 19). Thus, according to this strategy, the only hypothet-
ical vaccine capable of providing universal coverage would incorpo-
rate polysaccharide surface antigens from every known serotype of
S. pneumoniae. Such an objective is prohibitively expensive from a
manufacturing perspective and still does not eliminate the danger of
niche replacement with as yet undetected S. pneumoniae serotypes or
with other upper respiratory tract commensals and pathogens (19–23).
Here, a dual-functioning liposomal formulation allowed the coloca-
lization of complementary antigen types, eachassociated with a separate
state in commensal disease progression. From a manufacturing per-
spective, theliposomaldesign allowsa cost-effective andscalableformu-
lation, in stark contrast to the production of current vaccine options.
From a potency perspective, the liposomal formulation capacity and
the broad and distinct nature of the enclosed antigens enable the most
robust and comprehensive immune response reported to date, as mea-
sured against Prevnar and Pneumovax controls, the current standards
in commercial vaccine options for pneumococcal disease.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Our initial experiments sought to establish an alternative to the Prevnar
vaccine family, which rely on covalently attaching S. pneumoniae

 polysaccharide from specific serotypes to the immunogenic CRM197
protein (an inactivated mutant of the diphtheria toxin capable of ampli-
fying immune reactivity of the conjugated polysaccharide components),
resulting in so-called glycoconjugate vaccines (for example, Prevnar 13
features 13 different serotype polysaccharides covalently attached to
CRM197). As opposed to covalent polysaccharide protein coupling,
we used liposomaltechnology to encapsulate the required polysaccharide
content and to noncovalently attach and surface-display the CRM197
protein [termed liposomalencapsulation of polysaccharides (LEPS); figs.
S2 and S3]. By doing so, we achieved an in vivo antibody shift pattern
from immunoglobulin M (IgM) to IgG and effectiveness in total anti-
body titers and protection against S. pneumoniae bacterial challenge
comparable to Prevnar 13 (Fig. 1, A to C). In these comparisons, the
Pneumovax 23 vaccine (which contains purified CPSs from 23 sero-
types) was also tested and showed reduced effectiveness (antibody class
shift and titer and bacterial challenge protection) relative to Prevnar 13
and the LEPS formulation. LEPS achieves glycoconjugate vaccine ef-
fectiveness through noncovalent colocalization of polysaccharide and
CRM197. The option to scalably encapsulate additional polysaccharides
in the LEPS formulation further highlights differences to current glyco-
conjugatevaccineoptions,whichrequiresuccessiveeffortandmanufacturing
cost with each covalent attachment of a new serotype CPS to CRM197,
thus limiting both broad vaccine coverage and global access (24).
Additional assays provided insight into the immune response af-
forded by the LEPS platform. Namely, Fig. 1D presents data from an
opsonophagocytic activity (OPA) assay in which serum from immunized
mice is added to the 19F S. pneumoniae serotype (recognized by current
Prevnar and Pneumovax formulations) before coculture with HL60
human phagocytes. Bacterial killing is readily observed for all three
vaccine formulations, with LEPS again performing at levels comparable
to current standards. Table S1 presents a more thorough comparison
of serotypes assessed via the OPAassay across the three vaccine systems.
Similarly, fig. S4 highlights the effectiveness in protection against the
serotypes covered by Prevnar 7 and Prevnar 13 in addition to the seven
nonvaccine serotypes included in the LEPS formulation. Nasal wash
experiments indicate that the 19F S. pneumoniae serotype does not
establish residence in the mouse nasopharynx because of the cor-
responding polysaccharide included in the three vaccine systems being
compared in this case (Fig. 1E). Insight into the immune response
mechanism was provided by an anti-CD4+ T cell depletion assay in
whichantibody titers were significantly reduced, indicating antigen pro-
cessing through a thymus-dependent pathway (Fig. 1F). Finally, antibody
titers and OPA activity in rabbit subjects demonstrated consistent in
vivo trends compared to those observed in mice subjects (fig. S5).
Expansive protein antigen serotype assessment and the
prospect of universal coverage
The same liposomal technology that allowed an alternative pneumo-
coccal disease vaccine has the interesting potential to address comple-
mentary aspects of commensal-based disease progression. Namely, the
formulation offers the simultaneous encapsulation of polysaccharides
(colonization immune targets) that serve as the basis for current vac-
cines in addition to the liposomal surface localization of protein anti-
gens [GlpO and PncO; identified through an antigen discovery and

 validation model (25)] that selectively target pneumococci virulence
transition (fig. S1 and table S3). Before testing this possibility, the
OPA assay enabled a more careful assessment of the GlpO and PncO
protein antigens as a correlate of protection for future immunization
experiments. In this case, however, the OPA assay assessed both col-
onization (planktonic cells containing surface CPS) and dispersion
(biofilm-released cells displaying surface protein antigen targets) as-
pects of commensal disease progression in response to the correspond-
ing polysaccharide or protein antigen component. The resulting insight
contrasts traditional OPA assays that only assess planktonic CPS
cellular targets and, hence, have an innate bias toward colonization pre-
vention. As shown in table S2 and fig. S6, Prevnar 13, Pneumovax 23,
and the GlpO/PncO protein antigens demonstrate specific activity for
their respective cellular targets. Notably, the GlpO/PncO tandem is active
for >70 biofilm-released serotypes of S. pneumoniae. This is the largest
and most comprehensive assessment of advanced antigens for pneu-
mococcaldiseaseand,togetherwiththehigh-sequenceconservation of the
glpO/pncO genes across S. pneumoniae serotypes (26), emphasizes uni-
versal protection potential for any virulence-transitioned S. pneumoniae
cell. The protein antigens were also tested more thoroughly for immune
response mechanism(eitherin orseparate from the LEPS formulation),
showing predominant T helper 2 cell (TH2) response with contributing
TH1 and TH17 activity in mice (Fig. 2, A to E) and corresponding
humoral response in rabbits (Fig. 2F). Supporting the com-
plementary aspect of the antigen types, the PncO and GlpO proteins
were tested in both coadministration and add-on format with Prevnar 7,
demonstrating protective capabilities by addressing commensal coloni-
zation, virulence transition, or both (fig. S7).
A comprehensive vaccine platform through LEPS technology
Next, coupling the PncO and GlpO protein antigens to the liposomal
containment of polysaccharide resulted in the completed LEPS vehicle
(LEPS20/PncO + GlpO; Fig. 3), thus allowing for a definitive assessment
of the commensal disease progression vaccination paradigm. From
data in Figs. 1 and 2, the complete LEPS vehicle was expected to have
ideal immune response characteristics (class switching, memory, and
broad T cell activation). A humoral response resulted for each of the
antigen types in the completed vehicle (Fig. 3A) in addition to compre-
hensive and directed protection when tested in the in vivo influenza A
virus (IAV)–prompted pneumonia model of pneumococcal disease
transition. The challenge assays across strategic serotypes [19F (fig.
S8), 11A, and 35C) confirm the protective limits of Prevnar 13 and
Pneumovax 23 and highlight the full protective capabilities of the
complete LEPS system (Fig. 3B). Emphasizing antigen complementarity,
the LEPS20/PncO + GlpO formulation provides full protection even
without the requisite CPS needed to prevent the colonization of the
11A and 35C serotypes. The associated anatomical profiling further
confirms the ability of the final LEPS formulation to inhibit disease dis-
persion of nonvaccine serotypes. Similar results are found for pneu-
monia and sepsis disease models (fig. S9).

 Although the effectiveness of the LEPS vaccine was a key result, a
broader implication is the dual potential for eliminating the colonization
of the most invasive serotypes of S. pneumoniae while simultaneously
safeguarding against virulence transition of niche-replacement serotypes
not covered by current vaccine formulations. This is possible because
of the universal protection potential of the GlpO and PncO antigens
(tables S2 and S3), aided by sequence conservation across S. pneumoniae
strains and the minimization of antigenic drift across multiple antigens

 (26). Figure 4 provides a current and predicted time line of invasive
pneumococcal disease (IPD) cases, which emphasizes the recalcitrance
of nonvaccine serotypes and the potential of the LEPS formulation to
address these concerns. Notably, the LEPS platform also provides a
technically feasible vision for universality through the prospect of
encapsulating all known S. pneumoniae serotype polysaccharides (in
addition to surface-displaying the GlpO and PncO protein antigens),
an option that is economically infeasible with polysaccharide-protein
coupling chemistry accompanying current glycoconjugate vaccine
products. Hence, the LEPS platform combines the best aspects of
current vaccines while anticipating the basic tenets of commensal dis-
ease progression.
In summary, we report on the colocalization of two complementary
antigens as a next-generation vaccine for pneumococcal disease. With-
out compromising the effectiveness of current vaccine designs, we
introduce a modification that enables universality in vaccine response
to disease. The resulting LEPS platform thus minimizes invasive sero-
type colonization while also safeguarding against virulence transition
for all colonizing serotypes. As a result, the full disease progression
pathway has guided the development of a vaccine that offers a compre-
hensive answer to the challenging aspects of addressing pneumococcal
disease. More broadly, the concept outlined in this study seeks to bal-
ance the benefits and drawbacks to microbial commensalism, with an
approach adjustable to eliminate or retain residence as a function of
maximum benefit to the host.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Experimental design
Complementary antigens derived from the understanding and anal-
ysis of commensal-based disease progression were colocalized using
a liposomal carrier platform in the context of pneumococcal disease
vaccination. Forms of assessment included liposomal vector charac-
terization; tissue-specific disease progression; antibody, cytokine, and
T cell depletion analysis; end point and time-course challenge protec-
tion assays; comprehensiveopsonophagocytic activity assays; and tests
conducted in mouse and rabbit models. Data uniformly support a
potent vaccination strategy capable of directing an immune response
across the stages of commensal-based disease, with the potential for
universal coverage in the case of pneumococcal disease.
Ethics statement
This study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommen-
dations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the
National Institutes of Health. The protocols were approved by the
InstitutionalAnimalCareandUseCommitteeattheUniversityatBuffalo.
All bacterial inoculations and treatments were performed under con-
ditions designed to minimize any potential suffering of the animals.
Reagents
Bacterial and cell culture media [including chemically defined bac-
terial growth medium (CDM)] and reagents were purchased from
Fisher Chemical and Sigma-Aldrich. Sheep blood was purchased from
Hemostat Laboratories. Lipids DOPG-Na and DSPE-PEG2000 were
obtained from NOF. DOGS-NTA-Ni was purchased from Avanti Polar
Lipids. Dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC), cholesterol, alum (as
aluminum phosphate), and polysaccharides were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich. LL-37 was purchased from InvivoGen. Prevnar 7 and
Prevnar 13 and Pneumovax 23 vaccines were obtained from Pfizer
and Merck, respectively.
Antigen preparation
All proteins [CRM197, green fluorescent protein (GFP), PspA, GlpO,
and PncO] were recombinantly produced with polyhistidine tags
through Escherichia coli. Plasmids containing the genes for GFP,
CRM197, and PspA were obtained through collaborative exchange
(26, 27). Remaining genes were polymerase chain reaction (PCR)–
amplified from S. pneumoniae genomic DNA and cloned into separate
pET21c vectors using restriction sites Sac I/Xho I (glpO) and Nde I/Xho I
(pncO) introduced to the amplified products by the PCR primers (25).
After plasmids were confirmed by restriction digestion and colony PCR,
Fig. 4. IPD incidence rates in children (age, <5) (A) and the elderly (age, ≥65)
(B) from 1998 to 2040. The total incidence rate of IPD was segmented into disease
caused by Prevnar 7 (PCV7), PCV13, PPSV23, and nonvaccine-type (NVT) serotypes.
Nonvaccine-type serotypes are defined as those not contained in PCV13 (A) or
PPSV23 (B) vaccines. Incidence rates for PCV7 serotypes from 1998 to 2007 were
obtained from Pilishvili et al. (30). Total incidence rates and incidence rates for
PCV13 serotypes were obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
tion’s Active Bacterial Core surveillance program for S. pneumoniae (www.cdc.gov/
abcs/reports-findings/survreports/spneu-types.html). Incidence rates beyond 2007
(PCV7 serotypes) and 2015 (PCV13 serotypes) were predicted from trends observed
in previous years. Reduction in the total IPD after Prevnar 15 (PCV15) introduction
was projected on the basis of the serotype invasiveness (31, 32) and previous trends
for PCV7 and PCV13 with the rates stabilizing for 4 years after the introduction of
the vaccine. Projections for IPD with (dotted lines) or without (solid lines) LEPS in-
troduction were made beyond 2030. A reduction of IPD by 80% over 4 years (A) or
90% over 10 years (B) after the introduction of LEPS was based on the 98%
sequence coverage of the GlpO and PncO protein antigens (25) and activity dem-
onstrated against 70 S. pneumoniae serotypes (fig. S2).

confirm individual expression via induction of 3 ml of lysogeny broth
cultures at OD600 (optical density at 600 nm) values of 0.4 to 0.6 using
1 mM isopropyl b-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside before analysis by SDS–
polysaccharide gel electrophoresis. Confirmed expression prompted
1-liter-scale cultures for expression and protein purification through
disruption of cells using a French press and by passing cell lysate over
a fast protein liquid chromatography column (GE Healthcare HisTrap
HP, 1 × 1 ml). Final protein products were quantified using the Pierce
Micro BCA Protein Assay kit.
LEPS preparation and characterization
Proteins and polysaccharide components were colocalized through a
liposomal delivery system. LEPS liposomal carriers were composed of
DOPC/DOPG/DOGS-NTA-Ni/cholesterol/DSPE-PEG2000 at a molar
ratio of 3:3:1:4:0.1 to a total lipid mass of 500 mg. After dissolving lipids
in chloroform, the solution was sonicated for 1 min using a Branson
450D Sonifier (at 20% amplitude using a tapered tip) and then evap-
orated using a rotary evaporator to form a film. Lipids were then
rehydrated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing the poly-
saccharide antigens to form liposomes, which were then passed 10 to
12 times through a handheld extruder (Avanti Polar Lipids) with a
pore size of 200 nm. On ice, the background liposome solution was
passed twice through a filter with 50-nm pore size and replaced each
time with PBS. Next, proteins were incubated with liposomes for 30 min
at 4°C with surface attachment mediated via polyhistidine tag–Ni
chelation. CRM197 was included in the LEPS formulations used for
Fig. 1, figs. S4, S5, and S10, and table S1; CRM197 was not included
(replaced by GlpO/PncO) in the LEPS formulations used for Figs. 2
and 3 and figs. S6, S8, and S9. At this stage, any unbound protein
and polysaccharide were separated from the final LEPS construct via
overnight dialysis (molecular weight cutoff, 100 kDa) at 4°C. Throughout
the study, final formulations used during vaccinations were composed
of mixtures of LEPS particles containing individual polysaccharides. For
example, the final 20 valent CPS LEPS formulation resulted from
mixing 20 individually prepared samples. Alternatively, a coformulation
approach was also tested (with a limited number of serotype polysac-
charides) and compared to the mixing approach described directly
above with no differences in final vaccine protection (fig. S10). All final
LEPS formulations were prepared to deliver the same amount of poly-
saccharide content (and CRM197 protein, as needed) used in Prevnar
and Pneumovax formulations, which were diluted 1:10 in PBS before
immunizations.
Characterization of the LEPS particles began by analyzing poly-
saccharide encapsulation and surface protein binding efficiency. Quan-
tification was completed over a range of polysaccharide (using 19F)– or
protein (using GFP)–to–lipid ratios to identify the crossing point of
efficiency (fig. S3). For polysaccharide evaluation, 150ml of concentrated
sulfuric acid and 30 ml of phenol [5% (w/v)] were added to 50 ml of
liposome solution, followed by incubation at 80°C for 30 min and 22°C
for 30 min before colorimetric analysis at 495 nm. Protein content was
measured via fluorescence analysis at an excitation wavelength of 359 nm
and an emission wavelength of 508 nm. Both analyses were conducted
using a Synergy 4 Multi-Mode Microplate Reader (BioTek Instruments
Inc.), and measured values were compared to standards (using either
glucose or GFP) and ratioed to initial amounts of polysaccharide and
protein introduced to the LEPS production process. Dynamic light
scattering on a Zetasizer Nano ZS90 (Malvern) was used to evaluate
the particle diameter and zeta potential of liposomes at 25°C. All
experiments were conducted using a 4-mW, 633-nm HeNe laser
as the light source at a fixed measuring angle of 90° to the incident
laser beam. Images of the LEPS particles were obtained through
JEOL JSM-CXII transmission electron microscopy analysis at 100 kV,
with samples prepared by dip-coating a 200-mesh formvar and a carbon-
coated grid (FCF-200-Cu-TB, Electron Microscopy Sciences), followed
by negative staining using a 1% solution of uranyl acetate.
Vaccine immunization
Outbred 6-week-old female CD-1 mice (Harlan Laboratories) were
used in immunization experiments. Mice were immunized by sub-
cutaneous injection (200 ml). The background solution used for the
formulations was PBS (“sham” negative controls were background
solutions administered without antigen components). Final protein
antigen levels were 12.5 mg in either naked or liposomal formulations
(GlpO, PncO, CRM197, and PspA). When combined, PncO and GlpO
were administered at 6.25 mg each. Unless indicated otherwise, alum
adjuvant was added to protein samples according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. After 14 days, mice were boosted with the same formula-
tions. Serum samples were collected on days 14 and 28 by retro-orbital
bleeding forantibody andOPA analyses. Four-month-oldNew Zealand
white rabbits (Cocalico Biologicals) were immunized through intra-
muscular administration of 500 ml of respective samples at days 0 and
14. Peripheral blood samples were collected on days 14 and 28 for
antibody and OPA analyses.
Bacterial preparation and biofilm release
Bacterial strains used in this study were initially grown on Todd Hewitt
agar plates supplemented with 0.5% yeast extract and 5% sheep blood
and incubated overnight at 37°C. Single colonies were used to inoculate
5 ml of Todd Hewitt broth containing 0.5% yeast extract and incubated
at 37°C to an OD600 of 0.6. At this point, bacteria were collected by
centrifugation, washed once with and resuspended in PBS, and quan-
tified by OD600 measurement for experiments requiring planktonic
cells. Planktonic cells were introduced to the in vitro biofilm model
and were used in all OPA assays (unless specifically indicated other-
wise), mouse colonization analyses, and in vivo influenza-induced
pneumonia models.
To establish biofilm conditions, NCI-H292 epithelial cells [CRL-
1849, American Type Culture Collection (ATCC)] were first cultured
in RPMI 1640 with the addition of fetal bovine serum in T75 flasks at
37°C and 5% CO2. After reaching 100% confluency, H292 cells were
prefixed in 4% buffered paraformaldehyde at 34°C for 48 hours,
followed by three washes with PBS. CDM-grown pneumococci were
then seeded onto fixed H292 cells with change of medium occurring
every 12 hours. Formed biofilms were exposed to heat (38.5°C) for
4 hours, and released cells were then collected by centrifugation, washed
once with and resuspended in PBS, and quantified by OD600 measure-
ment. Experiments using biofilm-released cells included in vivo sepsis
and pneumonia models.
Challenge models
Mice were challenged with 1 × 104 (sepsis model) or 1 × 106 (pneumo-
nia model) CFU of pneumococci strains through intraperitoneal or
intranasal (with isoflurane) administration, respectively. To induce col-
onization, mice were administered 1 × 106 CFU bacteria intranasally
without isoflurane. To prompt influenza-induced pneumonia,
pneumococci colonization was followed by intranasal inoculation with
40 plaque-forming units of IAV [strain A/PR/8/34 (H1N1); ATCC

 VR-95]; titers were determined by plaque assays. Mice were monitored
every 4 hours for signs of morbidity (huddling, ruffled fur, lethargy, and
abdominal surface temperature). Mice found to be moribund were
euthanized via CO2 asphyxiation and cervical dislocation.
Antibody analysis
Antigen antibody titer analysis was conducted as described previously
(26), with the method extended to include 20 polysaccharides from
associated serotypes and the GlpO and PncO protein antigens. Thus, an
analysis was extended to all antigens used in the study. Cytokine mea-
surements were accomplished using IFN-g and IL-17A ELISA kits
(R&D Systems).
Tissue bacterial count
At 5 days after colonization, samples were analyzed as presented in
Fig. 1E and fig. S7 (B and C). After influenza-induced pneumonia,
mice were analyzed at 1 and 5 days after IAV administration, as indi-
cated, or upon becoming moribund; a combination of nasopharynx
tissue, nasopharyngeal lavage fluid, lung, and blood samples was
collected, and bacterial burden was determined as described previously
(28). Briefly, tissue and organ homogenate, lavage fluid, and blood were
homogenized to ensure dissociation of bacterial aggregates and then se-
rially diluted on tryptic soy and 5% blood agar plates before enumeration.
CD4+ depletion
For in vivo CD4+ T cell depletion, 0.5 mg of anti-CD4+ monoclonal
antibody (Invitrogen) was injected intraperitoneally into the mice for
3 consecutive days. After day 6, a T cell depletion of ≥95% was con-
firmed using flow cytometry, and these mice subjects were then used
in the indicated experiments.
OPA analysis
Extending upon a previous protocol (29), human HL60 cells were
differentiated with dimethlyformamide to quantify antibody-mediated
opsonophagocytosis and killing of S. pneumoniae exposed to dilutions
of sera collected from immunized mice subjects to identify the 50%
killing end point (quantified by CFU counts). HL60 cells and
pneumococci were incubated for 75 min.
Statistical analysis
Comparisons were analyzed for statistical significance using a two-tailed
Student’s t test for unpaired data through the GraphPad Prism software
(version 6.0h.283, GraphPad Software Inc.). All data resulted from a
minimum of three samples, with animal experiments using between
4 and 12 subjects.
