SUMMARY
Netrin1 has been proposed to act from the floor plate (FP) as a long-range diffusible 
chemoattractant for commissural axons in the embryonic spinal cord. However, netrin1 mRNA 
and protein are also present in neural progenitors within the ventricular zone (VZ), raising the 
question of which source of netrin1 promotes ventrally-directed axon growth. Here, we use genetic 
approaches in mice to selectively remove netrin from different regions of the spinal cord. Our

 analyses show that the FP is not the source of netrin1 directing axons to the ventral midline while 
local VZ-supplied netrin1 is required for this step. Furthermore, rather than being present in a 
gradient, netrin1 protein accumulates on the pial surface adjacent to the path of commissural axon 
extension. Thus, netrin1 does not act as a long-range secreted chemoattractant for commissural 
spinal axons, but instead promotes ventrally-directed axon outgrowth by haptotaxis, i.e. directed 
growth along an adhesive surface.
INTRODUCTION
The establishment of neural circuits during development requires neurons to extend axons 
along precise pathways towards their synaptic targets. Axons can navigate over considerable 
distances, using molecular cues in the embryonic environment to both spatially and 
temporally orient their growth cones (Butler and Tear, 2007; Phan et al., 2010). These 
guidance cues have been proposed to fall into four major categories: attractive or repulsive 
signals that act as either long-range diffusible molecules or short-range contact-dependent 
signals, i.e. tethered to a cellular membrane or the extracellular matrix (ECM) (Tessier-
Lavigne and Goodman, 1996). Particular attention has been placed on identifying diffusible 
cues from “guidepost” source cells, which could direct axonal growth cones over long 
distances.
The textbook example of a chemotropic guidance factor is netrin1, a member of the laminin 
superfamily first characterized in the vertebrate spinal cord (Kennedy et al., 1994; Serafini et 
al., 1994). Studies in chicken and mouse led to the proposal that netrin1 emanates from the 
floor plate (FP) and acts as a diffusible chemoattractant to direct the ventral growth of spinal 
commissural axons (Kennedy et al., 1994). Considerable work using soluble netrin1 in in 
vitro assays supported the hypothesis that it can act at a distance to orient axon growth (de la 
Torre et al., 1997; Ming et al., 1997; Sloan et al., 2015). However, subsequent investigation 
in other systems, including angiogenesis and retinal, pancreatic and mammary gland 
development, have indicated that netrin1 acts between cells, and between cells and the ECM, 
to regulate cell adhesion and tissue morphogenesis (Lai Wing Sun et al., 2011). Notably, 
studies in the Drosophila nerve cord and visual system have shown that membrane-tethered 
netrin was sufficient to rescue axon guidance defects in netrinA/B mutants (Brankatschk and 
Dickson, 2006; Timofeev et al., 2012). Recently, studies using live imaging in the visual 
system have demonstrated that target-derived netrin1 is required to attach growth cones to 
source cells (Akin and Zipursky, 2016). However, despite significant progress understanding 
netrin-mediated axon guidance, it has not been resolved whether netrin1 acts from the FP as 
a diffusible chemoattractant in vivo.
In the mouse spinal cord, netrin1 is expressed by neural progenitors in ventricular zone 
(VZ), in addition to the FP (Serafini et al., 1996). Moreover, netrin1 protein has a complex 
distribution that does not fit the model of a simple continuous gradient emanating from the 
FP (Kennedy et al., 2006). In this study, we set out to determine which source of netrin1 in 
the spinal cord directs axonal growth to the FP. To resolve this question, we used conditional 
genetic approaches in mouse to remove netrin1 expression from either the VZ or the FP. In 
the absence of either netrin1 or Dcc, spinal axons aberrantly innervate the VZ and

 commissural axons either stall or are dramatically defasciculated. However, these 
phenotypes are only observed when netrin1 is ablated from the VZ, but not the FP. We thus 
demonstrate that the key source of netrin1 supplying guidance activities comes from neural 
progenitors in the VZ, rather than the FP as previously suggested. Our studies further 
demonstrate that the cellular geometry of spinal neural progenitors permits the establishment 
of a netrin1+ growth substrate along the pial surface of the spinal cord, which acts to 
position and promote fasciculated spinal axon outgrowth, in a Dcc-dependent manner. Thus, 
rather than acting as a soluble diffusible molecule produced by the FP, we propose that 
netrin1 promotes ventrally-directed axon outgrowth in the spinal cord by haptotaxis, the 
directed growth of cells along an adhesive surface (Carter, 1965).
RESULTS
FP-derived netrin1 is not required for commissural axon guidance to the FP
The canonical model for netrin1 function in the spinal cord suggests that netrin1 acts as a 
diffusible chemoattractant emanating from the FP (Serafini et al., 1996). However, netrin1 
transcript is also expressed by many progenitors in the VZ in the mouse spinal cord (Serafini 
et al., 1996), a region ubiquitously avoided by spinal axons (Figures S1A, S1B) (Butler and 
Bronner, 2015). To resolve the role of FP- versus VZ-derived netrin1, we have used multiple 
genetic approaches to determine the spatial requirement for netrin1 in the developing spinal 
cord.
First, we assessed the consequence of anatomically deleting the FP on the trajectory of 
neurofilament (NF)+ spinal axons in E11.5 mouse embryos. Gli2 is a key transcriptional 
regulator that transduces sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling (Matise et al., 1998). The FP and 
V3 interneurons are ablated in Gli2−/− mutants, resulting in the loss of FP-derived netrin1 
(Figures 1A′, 1B′, 1D′ and 1E′) (Matise et al., 1998). Critically for our studies, the VZ 
expression of netrin1 is largely unaffected in Gli2−/− mutants (Figure 1B). In contrast, 
netrin1 expression is lost from the VZ in Gli2; netrin1 double mutants (Figure 1C). 
Strikingly, the absence of the FP has no significant effect on the trajectory of NF+ axons, 
they continue to ubiquitously avoid the VZ in similar numbers to control littermates (p>0.22, 
Figures 1D, 1E, 1G′, 1H′, 1J and 1K) (Kadison et al., 2006; Matise et al., 1999). In contrast, 
NF+ axons robustly extend into the VZ in Gli2−/−; netrin1lacZ/lacZ spinal cords (Figures 1F, 
1I′–1K), in comparable numbers to those observed in netrin1lacZ/lacZ single mutants 
(Figures 1BB, 1T). Thus, NF+ axon guidance defects are only observed in the absence of 
VZ-derived netrin1.
Second, we conditionally ablated netrin1 from the FP (netrin1ΔFP) using the Shh::cre driver 
line (Harfe et al., 2004) in combination with a netrin1flox/flox allele (Brunet et al., 2014). In 
these mice, the presence of cre in the FP (Figures 1N–1N″) results in the specific loss of 
netrin1 protein from the FP (Figures 1L–1M′). Remarkably, this manipulation resulted in no 
significant disruption in axonal growth (Figures 1X–1AA). In particular, both Tag1+ and 
Robo3+ commissural spinal axons project normally around the VZ and across the FP, in 
tightly fasciculated bundles, in a manner similar to control littermates (Figures 1P–1S, 1BB 
and 1CC; p>0.31). This result is in contrast to the previously characterized loss-of function 
allele of netrin1 (netrin1lacZ/lacZ) which shows multiple perturbations in axon growth: first,

 many NF+ axons grow medially into the VZ (arrows, Figures 1U, 1BB–1CC, S1C and S1F), 
second, Robo3+ commissural axons are profoundly defasciculated (Figures 1V, S1D and 
S1G) (Laumonnerie et al., 2015) and third, Tag1+ commissural axons stall above the 
developing motor column (Serafini et al., 1996) (arrows, Figure 1W). Taken together, these 
findings indicate that the commissural axon defects previously observed in netrin1 mutants 
do not arise from the loss of netrin1 from the FP.
VZ-derived netrin1 is necessary for axon guidance to the FP
We next sought to examine whether the selective loss of netrin1 from the VZ could 
recapitulate the axon guidance defects seen in netrinlacZ/lacZ mutants. Towards this goal, we 
removed netrin1 from all dorsal spinal progenitors (netrin1ΔdVZ) by recombining the 
netrin1flox/flox allele with a Pax3::cre driver line (Lang et al., 2005) (Figure 2C). Netrin1 
protein decorates both the pial surface of the spinal cord, as well as commissural axons 
(Kennedy et al., 2006; MacLennan et al., 1997). Following cre recombination, netrin1 is 
specifically ablated from the dorsal pial surface and axons extending within the dorsal spinal 
cord (Figures 2A, 2D), repositioning these axons laterally such that they contact the 
laminin+ basement membrane (Figures 2B, 2E). Netrin1 levels in the netrin1ΔdVZ FP are 
comparable to those seen in control littermates (Figures 2F, 2G).
The netrin1ΔdVZ manipulation resulted in many guidance phenotypes similar to those 
observed in netrin1lacZ/lacZ embryos. NF+ axons aberrantly grow both dorsally towards the 
RP and medially into the dorsal VZ (Figures 2H, 2L, 2P–2S). Robo3+ commissural axons 
are also significantly defasciculated compared to control littermates (Figures 2J, 2N, 2T and 
2U). Interestingly, the extent of defasciculation is not as profound as is observed for 
netrin1lacZ/lacZ embryos (Figures S1F, S1H), perhaps because netrin1 belatedly accumulates 
on axons as they grow into the ventral netrin1+ region (arrows, Figure 2D). Nonetheless, 
fewer netrin1+ axons appear to cross the FP (arrows, Figure 2F, 2G). Tag1+ axon growth is 
also diminished, such that fewer Tag1+ fascicles extend to the FP in the netrin1ΔdVZ 
mutants compared to littermate controls (Figures 2K, 2O).
We also examined the consequence of a smaller deletion in netrin1 expression by focally 
disrupting neural progenitor maintenance. We used a Dbx1::cre driver line to functionally 
inactivate Rbpj, the key transcriptional effector of the Notch signaling pathway, specifically 
in the p0 progenitor domain (Notch OFF; Kong et al., 2015). We used a ROSA26R::gfp 
reporter line to simultaneously lineage trace Dbx1+ cells (Figures 2V, 2AA). As previously 
reported (Kong et al., 2015), silencing Notch signaling in p0 progenitors results in the loss of 
Sox2 and other neural progenitor characteristics including netrin1 expression (brackets, 
Figures 2X–2Z, 2CC–2EE). This manipulation creates two ectopic boundaries of netrin1 
expression not seen in controls (brackets, Figures 2Y, 2DD). The distribution of pial-
associated netrin1 is not significantly affected by this manipulation (data not shown). 
Nevertheless, >2-fold more NF+ axons grow into the Notch OFF GFP+ region (arrows, 
Figure 2EE), with many axons precisely following along the edge of the ectopic netrin1 
boundaries (brackets, Figures 2W, 2BB, 2EE and 2II).
This axon growth phenotype does not result as a secondary consequence of inactivating 
Notch: conditionally ablating Rbpj from the pMN alters progenitor patterning (Kong et al., 
Varadarajan et al.

 2015), but does not disrupt the expression of Sox2 (Figures 2FF and 2HH) or netrin1 
expression (data not shown). Consistent with these findings, NF+ axon trajectories were not 
affected by this manipulation (brackets, Figures 2GG and 2HH). Collectively, these 
experiments demonstrate that the axonal growth defects observed in netrin1 mutants are due 
to the loss of netrin1 derived from the VZ, not the FP.
Neural progenitors establish a netrin1+ growth substrate on the pial surface of the spinal 
cord
We next explored the role that VZ-derived netrin1 plays guiding spinal axons. Previous 
studies have suggested that there is a key difference between the distribution of netrin1 
transcript, which can be detected by in situ hybridization or genetically encoded β-
galactosidase (β-gal) from the netrin1lacZ reporter line (Serafini et al., 1996), and netrin1 
protein (Kennedy et al., 2006). While netrin1 transcript is made by neural progenitors in the 
VZ (Figures 3A, 3B), netrin1 protein decorates the laminin+ pial surface (Figure 3C) and 
commissural axons (chevrons, Figure 3C′). We observed a striking coincidence between the 
presence of netrin1 at the pial surface and the dorsal boundary of netrin1 expression in the 
VZ (dotted lines, Figures 3A–3C). This alignment suggests that netrin1 is produced by 
bipolar neural progenitors and then transported via their nestin+ radial processes to the 
basement membrane where their endfeet contact the laminin+ pial surface (Hockfield and 
McKay, 1985). Supporting this hypothesis, we are unable to detect netrin1 protein in the 
dorsal-most spinal cord (Figures 3E, 3F), further suggesting that there is limited or no 
diffusion of netrin1. In the intermediate spinal cord, netrin1 protein can be readily detected 
in nestin+ fibers (Movie S1) and endfeet as they contact the basal pial surface (arrows, 
Figure 3H). Netrin1 is also co-localized with laminin on the pial surface (Figures 3G, 3I).
There is also a striking correlation between the pattern of spinal axon extension and the 
domains of netrin1 transcript and netrin1 protein. From early stages of axiogenesis, NF+ 
axons appear to preferentially extend immediately adjacent to the netrin1+ pial substrate 
(Figures 3K, 3K′), and do not innervate the VZ (Figures 3J, 3J′). By E11.5, all axons grow 
alongside the laminin+ netrin1+ pial substrate in the dorsal-intermediate spinal cord (Figures 
3M, 3M′). Tag1+ and Robo3+ axons also project in a fasciculated manner precisely around 
the netrin1::β-gal+ VZ (Figures 3L, 3M) and then beneath the netrin1::β-gal+ cells in the FP 
(dotted lines, Figure 3L′). Together with our genetic studies, these data support the model 
that commissural axon extension is shaped by the polarized deposition of netrin1 at the pial 
surface.
As commissural axons grow alongside the netrin1+ substrate, they accumulate netrin1 
protein (chevrons, Figures 3C′, 4B). This distribution is not an artifact of our detection 
methods: netrin1 is completely absent from both the pial surface and axons in netrin1lacZ/lacZ 
mutants (Figures 4D–4F). The remaining VZ staining (Figure 4) stems from the netrin1 
antibody recognizing a cytoplasmic truncated netrin1::β-gal fusion product (Poliak et al., 
2015; Serafini et al., 1996). Remarkably, we find that the axonal distribution of netrin1 is 
dependent on Dcc, the receptor thought to mediate chemoattractive responses to netrin1 
(Kolodkin and Tessier-Lavigne, 2011). In Dcc mutants, netrin1 is present at normal levels on 
the pial surface, but is greatly reduced in axons (Figures 4G–4I). Together, these results

 suggest that netrin1 accumulates on commissural axons in a Dcc-dependent manner to 
promote fasciculated axon growth around the VZ.
Dcc mediates the activity of VZ-derived netrin1
We further assessed the model that Dcc is required to mediate the activities of pial-
associated netrin1 by examining mice mutant for either Dcc or members of the Unc5 family, 
the receptor complex that mediates the chemorepellent activities of netrin1 (Kolodkin and 
Tessier-Lavigne, 2011). Dcc is widely expressed in postmitotic neurons in the spinal cord 
(Figure S2A) and Dcc protein decorates a broad population of commissural axons (Figures 
S2D–S2F) (Phan et al., 2011). Of the Unc5 family, only Unc5a and Unc5c have detectable 
expression in postmitotic neurons in the spinal cord (Figures S2B–S2C) (Engelkamp, 2002; 
Leonardo et al., 1997; Masuda et al., 2008). Analysis of Dcc, Unc5a and Unc5c mutants, 
demonstrated that only the loss of Dcc recapitulated all of the phenotypes seen in 
netrin1lacZ/lacZ mice to quantitatively similar amounts (Figures 4P, 1CC and S2M). In the 
absence of Dcc, NF+ and Robo3+ axons profusely project into the VZ (Figures 4M–4P) and 
Robo3+ axons are highly defasciculated, extending throughout the motor column (Figure 
4O). In contrast, Robo3+ axon extension was not perturbed in the Unc5a and Unc5c mutants 
(Figures S2G–S2I, S2M). Together, these observations support the conclusion that Dcc is the 
key receptor in spinal commissural axons that orients their ventrally-directed extension 
along the pial-netrin1 substrate and permits them to grow around the VZ.
DISCUSSION
Reassessing the role of netrin1 in the spinal cord
Netrin1 was first identified in a biochemical screen for soluble factors in chicken brain 
extracts that promote axon outgrowth (Kennedy et al., 1994; Serafini et al., 1994). Through 
these experiments, netrin1 became the prototypical example of a long-range diffusible 
chemoattractant, secreted by the FP (Figure 4Q). However, our studies support an alterative 
model: VZ-derived netrin1 acts as a growth substrate that promotes ventrally-directed axonal 
growth by haptotaxis (Figure 4R) (MacLennan et al., 1997). Our conditional genetic 
analyses have distinguished between these models. Axon guidance defects are observed after 
netrin1 is removed from the VZ but not the FP (Figures 4T–4U). Thus, FP-derived netrin1 is 
not required for commissural axon guidance.
Netrin1 belongs to the laminin superfamily, most closely resembling the laminin γ chain 
(Serafini et al., 1994), making it plausible that netrin1 functions within the context of the 
ECM. Our studies show that netrin1 closely associates with the laminin along the pial 
surface of the spinal cord, to establish a local growth substrate for axons. This result is 
consistent with previous studies demonstrating that netrin1 acts locally in other systems 
(Akin and Zipursky, 2016; Baker et al., 2006; Brankatschk and Dickson, 2006; Deiner et al., 
1997; Timofeev et al., 2012). While our model is inconsistent with the observations that 
netrin1 appears to act as graded diffusible chemoattractant in in vitro assays, it is noteworthy 
that these assays usually require ECM components, such as laminin or collagen for axon 
extension (Hazen et al., 2010). These ECM factors might convert bath- or pipette-applied 
netrin1 into a tethered substrate for growth (Moore et al., 2012).

 VZ-derived netrin1 mediates axon growth in a Dcc-dependent manner
Our studies suggest that netrin1 functions as a growth substrate for axons in the developing 
spinal cord. We propose that this growth substrate is established when netrin1 protein made 
by bipolar neuroepithelial progenitors is transported to the lateral margins of the spinal cord 
via the basal progenitor endfeet, which contact the laminin+ pial surface (Figure 4S) (Rousso 
et al., 2012). Pial-associated netrin1 both orients ventrally-directed axon growth and 
promotes fasciculation. The mechanism by which the netrin1 promotes axon fasciculation 
remains unclear; however, it is intriguing that netrin1 appears to accumulate on axons after 
encountering pial-associated netrin in a Dcc-dependent manner. Thus, netrin1 is only 
observed on commissural axons as they enter the ventral spinal cord after the ablation of 
netrin1 from dorsal neural progenitors (Figure 4U). Moreover, axonal netrin1 is greatly 
diminished in Dcc mutants even though netrin1 is present at the pial surface. One possibility 
is that Dcc and netrin interact in cis in commissural axons to promote their fasciculated 
growth around the VZ (Figure 4S). Indeed, Netrin and Dcc (frazzled) have previously been 
suggested to interact within axons in Drosophila, to permit the en passant presentation of 
netrin to subsequent axons (Hiramoto et al., 2000).
The VZ-derived netrin1 guidance cue also appears to permit axons to grow precisely around 
domains of netrin1 expression. This boundary activity was most notably observed after the 
focal loss of netrin1 expression in the VZ using the Notch OFF approach. NF+ axons deviate 
from their trajectories to follow the two ectopic borders of netrin1 expression in the VZ 
(Figure 2EE). The mechanistic basis of this boundary requires further study. Is the netrin1+ 
pial substrate an adhesive “go” surface that is sufficient to promote fasciculated axon 
growth, perhaps by “pulling” axons towards it and thereby out of the VZ? Or do the netrin1-
expressing neural progenitors also represent a “no go” region which is actively avoided by 
axons?
Our studies suggest that many classes of spinal axons require netrin1 to avoid growing in the 
VZ. The Tag1+ population of dorsal commissural axons may be an exception to this general 
rule. Neither Tag1+ nor Atoh1::taugfp+ (data not shown) commissural axons grow medially 
into the VZ as robustly as Robo3/NF+ axons in netrin1/Dcc mutants, suggesting that 
additional factors may keep the dorsal-most dI1 axons from growing into the VZ. However, 
as with other populations of spinal axons, Tag1+ axon outgrowth is not dependent on signals 
from the FP. Outgrowth defects are only observed when netrin1 is ablated either entirely 
(Figure 1W, (Serafini et al., 1996)) or specifically from the VZ (Figure 2O).
In summary, our studies show that FP-derived netrin1 is not required to direct axon growth, 
suggesting that netrin1 does not act as a diffusible chemotropic guidance signal for 
commissural axon guidance in the spinal cord, We propose that VZ-derived netrin1 provides 
an adhesive axon growth substrate to orient axon extension towards the ventral midline and 
promote axon fasciculation.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Generation and analysis of mutant mice—Netrin1 (Serafini et al, 1996), Dcc (Fazeli 
et al., 1997), Gli2 (Matise et al., 1998) mice were bred into 129/Sv backgrounds; Unc5a 
(Williams et al, 2006), Unc5c (Ackerman et al., 1997), Dbx1:: cre (Bielle et al, 2005), 
Olig2::cre (Dessaud et al, 2007; Kong et al, 2015), Rosa26R::gfp (Mao et al, 2001), 
Rbpjflox/flox mice (Han et al, 2002), Netrin1flox/flox mice (Brunet et al, 2014)), Shh::cre 
(Harfe et al, 2004) and Pax3::cre (Lang et al., 2005) were maintained in C57BL/6 
backgrounds. The netrin1 mutant strain stems from lacZ having been inserted into the 
netrin1 genomic locus and is considered to be a hypomorphic allele (Serafini et al., 1996). 
While there are trace amounts of residual netrin1 expression in netrin1lacZ/lacZ FPs, there is 
no detectable netrin1 transcript in the netrin1lacZ/lacZ VZ at any stage (Figures S1C) or any 
detectable netrin1 protein at either the pial surface or on spinal axons (Figure 4E). Note that 
as previously described (Poliak et al., 2015; Serafini et al., 1996), netrin1 antibodies detect 
both the endogenous protein associated with cell membranes and the netrin1::β-gal fusion 
protein, which accumulates in the cytoplasm of mutant cells.
Mice were handled and housed in accordance with the University of California Los Angeles 
IACUC guidelines. Embryos were derived from timed matings with heterozygous mice. The 
day of the plug was counted as E0.5, and embryos were harvested at E11.5. Notch OFF mice 
were generated by crossing Dbx1::cre mice with Rbpfflox/flox mice, as previously described 
(Kong et al., 2015). Netrin1 conditional knockout embryos were generated by crossing 
Shh::cre or Pax3::cre drivers with netrin1flox/flox mice. Netrin1lacZ/lacZ, Unc5c and Dcc 
analyses used littermate wild-type controls, except in the case of Unc5a mice, which were 
bred as homozygous mutants and compared to Unc5c wild-type controls. All the conditional 
knockout analyses used heterozygous floxed littermates as controls. Genotypes were 
identified by PCR reactions using cDNA for netrin1lacZ/lacZ embryos and genomic DNA for 
all other lines.
METHOD DETAILS
Immunohistochemistry—Mouse embryonic spinal cords (E10.5-E12.5) were fixed in 
4% paraformaldehyde for 2 hours at 4°C, cryoprotected in 30% sucrose in PBS overnight 
and thin-sectioned to yield 30μm transverse sections. Antibody staining was performed by 
incubating the sections with primary antibodies at 4°C overnight, followed by fluorescently-
labeled secondary antibodies at room temperature for 2 hours. Antibodies against the 
following proteins were used for immunostaining: Rabbit: neurofilament (NF), 1:200 (Cell 
Signaling Technology C28E10); Shh, 1:200 (H4 (Ericson et al., 1996)); Laminin, 1:1000

 (3A10 DSHB); Nestin, 1:50 (Rat-401 DSHB); Chicken: GFP, 1:1000 (Aves Lab #1020); 
neurofilament, 1:2000 (Millipore #AB5539). Secondary antibodies (all from Jackson 
Immunoresearch Laboratories) were used as follows: FITC, 1:500; Alexa488, 1:1000; 
Cyanine3, 1:1000; Cyanine5 1:700.
Antigen retrieval—The netrin1 antibody signal was augmented using standard antigen 
retrieval techniques. Slides were post-fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 minutes, 
rinsed with PBS, and boiled in a 10mM sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for 3 minutes in a 
microwave. Slides were allowed to cool in the buffer solution for 20 minutes at room 
temperature, before processing for immunohistochemistry. All netrin1 immunostaining was 
performed with antigen retrieval except when used with antibodies that were affected by the 
retrieval method; for example, Tag1 antigenicity was completely lost, while laminin 
antigenicity was moderately affected post-retrieval. The netrin1 staining in Figure 3G was 
performed without retrieval to preserve the antigenicity of the sample. Netrin1 protein is 
most readily observed after antigen retrieval methods. See figures 3C and 3G for a respective 
comparison with and without antigen retrieval; the specificity of the netrin1 antibody is 
demonstrated in Figure 4B and 4E.
Confocal Imaging and 3D rendering—Images were acquired on Carl Zeiss LSM700, 
LSM800 and LSM880 with Airyscan confocal microscopes and processed using Carl Zeiss 
Zen 2012 and Adobe Photoshop CS6 software. Imaris x64 v8.3 and Imaris XT software 
from Bitplane Inc (http://bitplane.com) were used to render 3d models of images. Movies 
S1, S2, S3 were processed using Imaris and Imaris XT: the ‘spots’ function was used to 
render 3D models of netrin1 protein while the ‘surfaces’ function was used to render 3D 
models of nestin and NF. A threshold for intensity sum was used for each channel and spots 
were further classified with respect to distance from each surface using the ‘spots close to 
surface’ Matlab Imaris XTension.
In situ hybridization—Digioxigenin (DIG) labeled probes against the 3′ untranslated 
regions of genes of interest were generated using the Roche RNA Labeling Kit and were 
used on 12μm transverse sections. mRNA signal was visualized using NBT/BCIP and anti-
DIG antibody conjugated with an alkaline phosphatase fragment (Roche). Target sequences 
were amplified using cDNA from mouse embryonic spinal cord using the following primers 
that were designed with the Primer 3 program (http://primer3plus.com/):
Unc5A: forward 5′-TGAAGTTGTCCCTCGATGCT-3′, reverse 5′-
GACATTAACCCTCACTAAAGGGAGTGATCGTGTGCCTGAATCC-3′;
Unc5C: forward 5′- CCTTTGCCCATTTCTGTGTT-3′, reverse 5′-
GACTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGAAGACAGCAGGAGGGTGA-3′;
The underlined text denotes either a T3 or T7 polymerase binding site. Dcc and netrin1 
probes were described previously (Phan et al., 2011) (Serafini et al., 1996).
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample sizes, but these were similar to 
those in our previous publications (Phan et al., 2010). All quantifications were performed

 (H–K, R, T) In control littermates, NF+ axons generally avoid the VZ (I) and dorsal-most 
spinal cord (R), while Robo3+ (J) and Tag1+ (K) commissural axons project in a tightly 
fasciculated bundle around the VZ and towards the FP (arrows, T).
(L–O) In contrast, there are many axon guidance defects in the netrin1ΔdVZ embryos. NF+ 
axons extend into the dorsal VZ, with some axons reaching the roof plate (magnified panel 
in S). Robo3+ axons are defasciculated as they extend ventrally (N, arrows, U), and the 
number of Tag1+ axons reaching the FP appears to be diminished (O).
(P, Q) Quantification demonstrated that 2-fold more NF+ axons extend towards the VZ in the 
netrin1ΔdVZ embryos 29.4±0.9 NF+ axons/section; n=l02 sections from 5 embryos) 
compared to controls (l6.0±l.0 NF+ axons/section; n=64 sections from 3 embryos). These 
NF+ axons only grew into the VZ in the dorsal zones (i.e. zones l and 2), where netrin1 was 
no longer present, while no significant difference was observed in zones 3 and 4 (p>0.ll and 
p>0.32 respectively). (V–Z) The Dbx1::cre driver line targets GFP reporter gene expression 
to the p0 domain (box in V shown magnified in panel Z).
(AA–EE) The Dbx1::cre driver line is used to deplete Notch signaling from p0 domain, the 
Sox2+ progenitors in this region (brackets,CC) rapidly differentiate into post-mitotic neurons 
(Kong et al., 20l5), which do not express netrin1 (bracket, DD). NF+ axons now extend 
around the ectopic netrin1 boundary (arrows, BB).
(FF–HH) Loss of Notch signaling in the Olig2+ pMN domain has no effect on Sox2+ 
progenitors (bracket, HH), and does not create an ectopic netrin1 boundary or perturb NF+ 
axon trajectories. (II) There are >2 fold more NF+ axons/μm entering the VZ in the GFP+ p0 
region in the Notch OFF spinal cord compared to controls. Of these, 2-fold more project 
precisely along the p0 GFP boundary. There was no significant difference (p>0.15) in the 
number of NF+ axons projecting into the VZ outside the GFP+ p0 region in the Notch OFF 
and control spinal cords. Control: n=47 sections from 4 mice; Notch OFF: n= 66 sections 
from 6 mice.

E11.5 thoracic (C–G and M) netrin1+/+ mouse spinal cords. Note that for netrin1 
immunohistochemisty, panel G was processed without antigen retrieval.
(A, B) Netrin1 (A) and netrin1::β-gal (B) are both present in FP cells and neural progenitors 
in the VZ. The domain of netrin1 and netrin1::β-gal expression extends from the ventral 
midline to a dorsal boundary at the same level as the dorsal root entry zone (DREZ, dotted 
line).

 (C) In contrast, high levels of netrin1 protein are observed around the basal pial 
circumference of the spinal cord starting at the same dorsal boundary observed for netrin1 
expression (dotted line), Netrin1 is also present on commissurally projecting axons 
(chevrons, C, C′).
(D–I) Netrin1 protein co-localizes with both the nestin+ progenitor processes (arrows, H) 
and the laminin+ pial surface (I). Netrin1 is not present at the pial surface in the dorsal-most 
spinal cord, i.e. above the DREZ, where netrin1::β-gal is not present in the VZ (E, F). See 
also Movie S1.
(J, K) NF+ axon extension is co-incident with the dorsal border of both netrin1:: β-gal 
expression and netrin1 on the pial surface (dotted line, J′, K′).
(L) By Ell.5, NF+ and Tag1+ axons project around a continuous border of netrin1::β-gal+ 
cells, that spans from the dorsal VZ to the apical FP (dotted lines, L′). Commissural axons 
are most fasciculated as they project beneath the domain of netrin1:: β-gal at the FP (L′).
(L, M) Axon growth also correlates with distribution of netrin1 protein. NF+ axons and 
Tag1+ Robo3+ commissural axons extend immediately adjacent to the laminin+ netrin1+ pial 
surface in the dorsal spinal cord (M′).

 Figure 4. Dcc mediates the response to VZ-derived netrin1
(A–O) Thoracic level transverse sections of E11.5 netrin1+/+; dcc+/+ (control, A–C, J–L) 
netrin1lacZ/lacZ (D–F), and Dcc−/− (G–I, M–O) mouse spinal cords.
(A–F) Antigen retrieval (see methods) boosts the netrin1 signal in axons (chevrons, B, C) 
and the pial surface (see also Movie S2). This staining is lost in netrin1lacZ/acZ embryos (E, 
F). As previously described (Poliak et al., 2015), netrin1 antibodies detect the netrin1::β-gal 
fusion protein in VZ.
(G–I) Netrin1 accumulation in NF+ axons is greatly diminished in Dcc mutant spinal cords, 
even though pial-netrin1 remains intact (see also Movie S3).
(J–L) Control NF+ (K) and Robo3+ (L) axons project precisely around the VZ.
(M–O) In contrast, Dcc mutant NF+ and Robo3+ axons exuberantly project dorsally into the 
VZ at all levels (N, O). Robo3+ axons are also profoundly defasciculated in the motor 
columns (O).
(P) Quantification of the average number of NF+ axons extending into the VZ demonstrates 
that a comparable number of NF+ axons extend into the VZ in Dcc and netrin1 (Figure 
1BB–1CC) mutant embryos. Control: n=44 sections, 3 embryos, and Dcc−/−: n=l05 sections, 
6 embryos.
(Q) In the canonical model, netrin1 functions as a long-range chemoattractant secreted by 
cells in the FP.

 (R, S) In the growth substrate model, netrin1 produced by neural progenitors is transported 
to the pial surface in their radial processes to form a growth substrate (green line). Axons 
then extend adjacent to this substrate in a Dcc dependent manner.
(T, U) Our conditional analyses support the growth substrate model, by demonstrating the
