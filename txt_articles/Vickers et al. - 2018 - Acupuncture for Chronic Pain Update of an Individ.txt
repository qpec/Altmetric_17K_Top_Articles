Abstract
Despite wide use in clinical practice, acupuncture remains a controversial treatment for chronic 
pain. Our objective was to update an individual patient data meta-analysis to determine the effect 
size of acupuncture for four chronic pain conditions. We searched MEDLINE and the Cochrane 
Central Registry of Controlled Trials randomized trials published up until December 31, 2015. We 
included randomized trials of acupuncture needling versus either sham acupuncture or no 
acupuncture control for non-specific musculoskeletal pain, osteoarthritis, chronic headache, or 
shoulder pain. Trials were only included if allocation concealment was unambiguously determined 
to be adequate. Raw data were obtained from study authors and entered into an individual patient 
data meta-analysis. The main outcome measures were pain and function. An additional 13 trials 
were identified, with data received for a total of 20,827 patients from 39 trials. Acupuncture was 
superior to both sham and no acupuncture control for each pain condition (all p<0.001) with 
differences between groups close to 0.5 standard deviations (SD) for comparison with no 
acupuncture control and close to 0.2 SDs in comparison with sham. We also found clear evidence 
that the effects of acupuncture persist over time with only a small decrease, approximately 15%, in 
treatment effect at one year. In secondary analyses, we found no obvious association between trial 
outcome and characteristics of acupuncture treatment, but effect sizes of acupuncture were 
associated with the type of control group, with smaller effects sizes for sham controlled trials that 
used a penetrating needle for sham, and for trials that had high intensity of intervention in the 
control arm. We conclude that acupuncture is effective for the treatment of chronic pain, with 
treatment effects persisting over time. While factors in addition to the specific effects of needling 
at correct acupuncture point locations are important contributors to the treatment effect, decreases 
in pain following acupuncture cannot be explained solely in terms of placebo effects. Variations in 
the effect size of acupuncture in different trials are driven predominately by differences in 
treatments received by the control group rather than by differences in the characteristics of 
acupuncture treatment.

Introduction
Acupuncture remains a controversial treatment for chronic pain, largely due to a provenance 
outside biomedicine. Traditional acupuncture theory invokes non-anatomical structures such 
as meridians and non-physiological processes such as the flow of qi energy. Although many 
contemporary practitioners do not rely on such concepts, there remains a dearth of data on 
how insertion of needles at specific points on the body could lead to long-term decreases in 
pain. Acupuncture undoubtedly has short-term physiological effects, several of which are

 relevant to pain7, 76, 119, but there is as yet no explanation as to how such effects could 
persist.
We previously reported an individual patient data meta-analysis of high-quality trials of 
acupuncture for chronic pain.92 Differences between acupuncture and control in trials 
without sham (placebo) control were both statistically and clinically significant. 
Acupuncture was significantly superior to sham control, suggesting that acupuncture effects 
are not solely explicable in terms of placebo, although these differences were relatively 
modest. We have separately reported secondary analyses examining whether characteristics 
of acupuncture treatment65 or control groups68 influence effect size, and whether the effects 
of acupuncture treatment persist over time69. Here we update our prior analyses now 
including studies published during the last 7 years.
Methods
The full protocol of the meta-analysis93 and the results of the first individual patient data 
meta-analysis including RCTs published up to November 200892 have been published. The 
literature search was repeated to identify eligible RCTs published between December 2008 
and December 2015. Trials were considered eligible if they accrued patients with 
nonspecific back or neck pain, shoulder pain, chronic headache, or osteoarthritis; pain 
duration was at least 4 weeks for musculoskeletal disorders; at least one group received 
acupuncture needling and one group received either sham acupuncture or no acupuncture 
control; the primary endpoint was measured more than 4 weeks after the initial acupuncture 
treatment; and allocation concealment was determined unambiguously to be adequate. 
Principal investigators of eligible studies were asked to provide raw data. These raw data 
were used to replicate all analyses published in the original RCT publication to ensure data 
accuracy. Each trial was reanalyzed by analysis of covariance with the standardized primary 
endpoint (scores divided by pooled standard deviation) as the dependent variable, and the 
baseline measure of the primary endpoint and variables used to stratify randomization as 
covariates. The primary outcome for each study was that identified by the responding author 
of each study. The effect sizes for each study were then entered into a meta-analysis using 
the metan command in Stata (version 13, StataCorp, College Station, TX). Both fixed effects 
and random effects estimates were calculated. Fixed effects weights were calculated using 
inverse-variance weighting, and random effects weights were calculated using the 
DerSimonian and Laird method. We pre-specified that meta-analyses would be conducted 
separately for comparisons of acupuncture vs. sham and acupuncture vs. no acupuncture 
control, and within each pain type, and the hypothesis test would be based on the fixed 
effects analysis. In the original paper, trials for which individual patient data were not 
available were included as a sensitivity analysis; in this update, we include summary data for 
these trials in the main meta-analysis and exclude them as a sensitivity analysis.
As secondary analyses, we examined whether characteristics of acupuncture treatment 
modified treatment effects. Both trial-level and patient-level analyses were performed. For 
trial-level analyses, we used random-effects meta-regression to test the effect of each 
characteristic on the main effect estimate using the Stata command metareg. For patient-
level analyses, we created a linear regression as for the main analysis of effect size, but

 included the characteristic and an interaction term between the characteristic and treatment 
allocation. The coefficient was then entered into a meta-analysis. In both analyses, random 
effects estimates and 95% confidence intervals were reported; p values are based on the 
fixed effects analysis. We also analyzed the effect of acupuncture relative to different types 
of sham acupuncture and different types of no acupuncture control group. Three 
comparisons of sham acupuncture were investigated: penetrating needle vs both non-
penetrating needle and non-needle sham; non-penetrating needle vs non-needle sham; and 
the use of true acupuncture points vs non-acupuncture points among trials using non-
penetrating or non-needle sham. For sham arms using penetrating needles, there was also a 
comparison done between the use of deep needle penetration and shallow needle 
penetration. We entered the effect size and standard error for each trial into a meta-
regression along with the type of sham acupuncture used in that trial. For this analysis, 
smaller effect sizes indicate a smaller difference in effect between verum acupuncture and 
sham acupuncture, implying that the type of sham acupuncture used is more active and 
therefore more similar to verum acupuncture. For the analysis of acupuncture effect relative 
to no acupuncture control group, we used meta-regression to compare the effects of trials 
using no acupuncture control groups characterized as high intensity, usual care, or low 
intensity. We also repeated our prior analyses exploring possible effects of publication bias 
and exploring difference between sham acupuncture and no treatment.
Results
Systematic Review
Our systematic review93 was updated to include trials published after November 2008 and 
before December 31, 2015. We identified 75 additional RCTs, of which 13 were eligible 
(Figure 1). These 13 studies include four trials19, 56, 75, 85 included as summary data only in 
a sensitivity analysis in our first report.
Data Extraction and Quality Assessment
Individual patient data for 2,905 patients were received from 10 of these 13 studies and 
included patients from the United States, Australia, China, Germany and the UK. For one of 
the three studies for which we did not receive data, the statisticians involved in the RCT 
failed to respond to repeated enquiries despite approval for data sharing being obtained from 
the principal investigator. For the other two studies, the trial authors were contacted and 
invited to participate but we received no further response. These three studies were included 
in the analysis as summary data only using the published estimates of effect size.31, 70, 75 
Two trials from the original systematic review for which data were not received were also 
included as summary data in these analyses.23, 74
A total of 20,827 patients were included in the total 39 trials (Table 1). The trials comprised 
25 comparisons with 16,041 patients of acupuncture and no acupuncture control, and 26 
comparisons with 7,237 patients of acupuncture and sham acupuncture control. Of the trials 
on musculoskeletal pain, most had an eligibility criterion of a minimum 3 or 6 months pain 
duration. Amongst those for which individual patient data on chronicity were available, the 
median duration was 4 years (quartiles: 1.1 years, 10 years). There were two trials for which

 the time period between first symptom and evaluation of outcome could theoretically have 
been less than three months based on eligibility criteria and timing of assessment. For Irnich 
et al., the duration of disease was “4–52 weeks” for 19% of patients and longer than one 
year for the remainder.41 In the case of Kleinhenz et al., no data were provided on 
chronicity, however, the indication was rotator cuff tendinitis, which is rarely treated in the 
acute phase.52 We conclude that all but a trivial proportion of patients included in the 
analysis would have met the conventional definition of chronic pain, that is, pain lasting at 
least 3 to 6 months. Six sham RCTs were determined to have an intermediate likelihood of 
bias from unblinding.13, 26, 41, 49, 59, 103 In one trial, two types of sham acupuncture were 
used, although only one type (non-needle sham acupuncture) was found to have an 
intermediate likelihood of bias from unblinding.103 One trial (Hinman et al.) was determined 
to have a sham acupuncture arm with a high likelihood of bias from unblinding.39 This trial 
was excluded from the main analyses comparing acupuncture to sham acupuncture, but a 
sensitivity analysis including this trial was performed. None of the 10 new trials included in 
this analysis had dropout rates of higher than 25%.
Meta-analysis
Forest plots for acupuncture against sham acupuncture and against no acupuncture control 
are shown separately for each of the 4 pain conditions in Figure 2 and Figure 3. Fixed effects 
weights are reported in Figures 2 and 3; forest plots with random effects weights reported 
are presented in Figures S1 and S2 of the supplementary materials. Meta-analytic statistics 
are shown in Table 2. Consistent with the results of the originally published meta-analysis, 
acupuncture is found to be statistically superior to control for all analyses (p < 0.001). Effect 
sizes in the updated analyses are similar to those in the original analyses, with effect sizes 
changing by 0.02 or less for most comparisons. Effect sizes are close to 0.5 in comparison to 
no acupuncture control and 0.2 for comparisons with sham. To illustrate these effect sizes in 
more clinically applicable terms, if baseline pain score in a typical RCT was 60 on a scale of 
0–100, with a standard deviation of 25, follow-up scores might be 43 in a no acupuncture 
control group, 35 in a sham acupuncture group, and 30 among true acupuncture patients. If 
response were defined as a pain reduction of 50% or more, response rates would be 
approximately 30%, 42.5% and 50%, respectively. Also in keeping with the original 
analyses, significant heterogeneity was found in 5 out of 7 comparisons. Significant 
heterogeneity remained for sham-controlled musculoskeletal pain and osteoarthritis 
(p=0.001 and p<0.001, respectively) even after excluding the outlying Vas et al. trials. There 
was also significant heterogeneity for all indications in the comparison of acupuncture with 
no acupuncture control. Heterogeneity is further explored below (“Modifiers of Trial 
Outcome”).
Sensitivity Analyses
Prespecified sensitivity analyses are also shown in Table 2. The exclusion of the RCTs by 
Vas et al.89–91 repeats our prior finding that the effect sizes for comparison with sham are 
similar for musculoskeletal pain, osteoarthritis and chronic headache. However, there are 
now sufficient trials for a meta-analysis of shoulder pain trials without inclusion of Vas et al.
90 and the effect size for this indication is clearly much greater. There is also a large effect 
size for sham controlled neck pain trials when these are analyzed separately from back pain.

 Most other sensitivity analyses had little impact on the main findings. Analyses 
incorporating assessment of patient blinding, missing data or trials without individual patient 
data, all had very similar results to the primary analysis. As the primary outcome included in 
the analysis was the outcome specified by the trial authors, we also performed a sensitivity 
analysis restricted to a single endpoint (pain intensity) at a fixed follow-up time (2 – 3 
months after randomization). Results were again very similar apart from sham-controlled 
trials of musculoskeletal pain (Table 3), where effect size decreased from 0.30 to 0.13, but 
this appears to be attributable to there being only 5 out of 11 trials that measured pain 
intensity at 2–3 months, and the trials excluded happened to be those with the larger effect 
sizes.
We combined all trials into one meta-analysis for all indications to assess the possible effect 
of publication bias. As in the original analyses, we found some evidence that smaller studies 
had larger effect sizes for the sham comparison (p=0.024), but not for the no acupuncture 
comparisons (p=0.75). No significant asymmetry was seen after excluding the Vas trials and 
shoulder pain trials from the sham comparison (N=21, p=0.13), and also when excluding 
any trials with fewer than 100 patients (N=21, p=0.069). We found that the difference 
between acupuncture and control would become non-significant only if there were 51 and 
>100 unpublished trials with 100 patients and effect sizes in favor of control of 0.25 SD for 
sham and no acupuncture control respectively.
We also repeated our exploratory analysis comparing sham control with no acupuncture 
control. In a meta-analysis of 12 RCTs that had both sham and no acupuncture control arms, 
the effect sizes for sham were 0.39 (95% CI 0.33, 0.45) and 0.45 (95% CI 0.29, 0.61) for 
fixed and random effects, respectively (p<0.0001 for tests of both effect and heterogeneity).
Modifiers of trial outcome
In addition to updating the primary analyses, we also updated previously published analyses 
on how characteristics of the acupuncture and control interventions influence trial outcomes. 
Trial-level and patient-level characteristics are found in Tables 4 and 5, respectively.
Acupuncture Characteristics Analysis—We updated previously reported analyses 
examining whether characteristics of acupuncture treatment modified the effect of 
acupuncture relative to control. These analyses include both trial-level analysis, based on 
characteristics described in the study protocol, and patient-level analyses, based on data 
related to the individual patient. The results are shown in Table 6. We did not find any 
obvious association between trial outcome and characteristics such as the style of 
acupuncture (Traditional or Western), use of fixed versus individualized point selection or 
the use of electrical stimulation. The only clear finding was a dose-response effect to number 
of acupuncture treatments in trials with a no acupuncture control group (increase in effect 
size of 0.10 per five sessions, 95% CI −0.01, 0.21, p=0.001).
Sham Acupuncture Control Analysis—We also updated a previously published 
analysis looking at the effects of acupuncture relative to different types of sham acupuncture 
and no acupuncture control groups. Differences in effect between acupuncture and the 
different sham acupuncture groups are found in Table 7. The largest difference in effect

 between acupuncture and sham acupuncture was seen in trials using non-penetrating 
needles, while the smallest difference was seen in trials using needle penetration. Significant 
differences were found between trials using penetrating needle sham and those trials that 
used non-penetrating or non-needle sham (difference in SD −0.30, 95% CI −0.60, −0.00, 
p=0.047), although this result was sensitive to the exclusion of the outlying Vas trials 
(difference in SD −0.07, 95% CI −0.24, 0.10, p=0.4, Table 8), two of which used non-
penetrating controls.
No Acupuncture Control Analysis—In addition to updating the analysis comparing 
types of sham acupuncture control, we also updated the analysis comparing types of no 
acupuncture control. We updated the categorization of no acupuncture control groups, and 
categorized trials as having a high intensity, usual care, or low intensity control group. In a 
“high intensity” control group, patients received a specified course of protocol-guided 
treatment. For instance, the UK APEX trial by Foster et al.33 is considered a high intensity 
control because patients were randomized to receive a course of individualized, supervised 
physical therapy plus acupuncture vs. physical therapy alone. In a trial with “usual care” 
control, patients are able to access whatever care they might reasonably receive outside of 
the study. As an example, in the UK NHS study, patients were randomized to “use” vs. 
“avoid” acupuncture and could receive whatever other treatments were offered to them.95 A 
control group was defined as “low intensity” if patients were not allowed to receive certain 
treatments that might otherwise be available. For instance, the Acupuncture Randomized 
Trials for low back pain and osteoarthritis limited treatment of pain in the control group to 
oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, excluding other types of treatment, such as 
steroids and other classes of analgesics.11, 108 Trials were assessed and assigned a control 
group type by three collaborators, with disagreements resolved by consensus. One trial was 
excluded from this analysis as there was a reasonable argument that it involved active 
control, prespecified to be excluded.26 Differences in effect between acupuncture and no 
acupuncture control groups are presented in Table 7. Significant differences were found 
between acupuncture and control for all types of no acupuncture control group. Notably, 
however, in trials that had high intensity control groups, acupuncture had smaller effect sizes 
compared to those with low intensity controls groups (difference −0.81, 95% CI −1.26, 
−0.36, p=0.0004); similarly in trials with usual care control acupuncture had smaller effect 
sizes than trials with a low intensity control group (difference in SD −0.65, 95% CI −0.98, 
−0.31, p=0.0002, Table 8).
Time Course of Acupuncture Effects Analysis
We updated a previously published analysis assessing change in the effects of acupuncture 
over time relative to sham acupuncture and no acupuncture control69. Number of weeks of 
acupuncture treatment and the time points used in this analysis are reported in Table 9. A 
total of 14 trials and 4,124 patients were included in the analysis of acupuncture vs no 
acupuncture control. The fixed-effects estimate for the between-group comparison of 
acupuncture vs no acupuncture controls showed a decrease in the effect size of acupuncture 
of 0.019 SD per 3 months (95% CI −0.041, 0.003, p=0.096, p=0.011 for heterogeneity, 
Figure 4a). Given a difference between acupuncture and no acupuncture control of around 
0.5 SD, this is equivalent to about a 15% decrease in acupuncture effect relative to control at

 1 year after randomization, which was usually between 9 and 10 months after the end of 
treatment. In the analysis of acupuncture vs sham acupuncture, a total of 21 trials and 6,276 
patients were included. There was a non-significant decrease of 0.012 SD per 3 months in 
acupuncture relative to sham acupuncture (95% CI −0.035, 0.011, p=0.3, Figure 4b), about a 
25% decrease in acupuncture effect at 1 year after randomization. Significant heterogeneity 
among trials was seen (p<0.0001). The previous analysis found that the decrease in effect of 
acupuncture relative to sham was driven by the decrease in neck pain trials (a decrease of 
0.587 SD per 3 months, 95% CI −0.767, −0.406, p<0.0001). We also analyzed the change in 
acupuncture relative to sham excluding these trials and found a non-significant decrease of 
−0.003 SD per 3 months (95% CI −0.026, 0.020, p=0.8) with no significant heterogeneity 
among trials (p=0.12). Hence almost all the decrease in acupuncture effects in this analysis 
seems attributable to neck pain.
As a sensitivity analysis, we repeated the analyses including only trials that found a 
significant difference between acupuncture and control, as trials that showed no difference 
between groups cannot show a reduction in acupuncture effects over time. Nine trials with 
2,997 patients were included in this analysis for the comparison between acupuncture and no 
acupuncture controls. A smaller and still non-significant decrease in the effect of 
acupuncture was found (−0.008 SD per 3 months, 95% CI −0.034, 0.018, p=0.5) and 
heterogeneity between trials was reduced (p=0.082). None of the newly included trials 
showed a significant effect of acupuncture vs sham and so this analysis of sham-controlled 
trials with a significant effect contains the same 7 trials and 1,450 patients and has the same 
results as reported in the original publication (−0.049 SD per 3 months, 95% CI −0.086, 
−0.013, p=0.008, heterogeneity p<0.0001).
Discussion
We updated an individual patient data meta-analysis of high-quality trials of acupuncture for 
chronic pain with seven additional years of data. An additional 10 studies were included 
with nearly 3,000 patients. In total, our analyses include 39 studies and 20,827 patients. The 
results confirm and strengthen prior key findings that acupuncture has a clinically relevant 
effect compared to no acupuncture control. Moreover, we confirmed that, although the 
effects of acupuncture are not completely explicable in terms of placebo effects, factors 
other than the specific effects of needling at correct acupuncture point locations are 
important contributors to acupuncture treatment benefit. Effects of acupuncture appear to 
persist over at least a 12 month period.
Heterogeneity continues to be an obvious aspect of our findings, with the results of trials 
varying by more than would be expected by chance. We have presented data that 
heterogeneity is predominately driven by differences between control groups rather than by 
differences between acupuncture treatment characteristics. We did not find any obvious 
differences between the results of trials depending on treatment characteristics such as style 
of acupuncture, duration of treatment sessions or training of acupuncturists. By contrast, we 
found evidence that effect sizes of acupuncture were smaller for sham-controlled trials with 
penetrating needles and for no acupuncture control trials where patients received high 
intensity care (e.g. a trial of acupuncture plus physical therapy vs. physical therapy alone). In 
Vickers et al.

 some cases, heterogeneity was also driven by a set of outlying trials with large effect sizes. 
We have presented these analyses with and without the outlying trials to provide all 
necessary information for interpreting these results and drawing conclusions.
Another novel finding is the higher than average effects of acupuncture on upper body 
musculoskeletal pain. We now have sufficient data to conduct a meta-analysis for neck pain 
and for shoulder pain, even after exclusion of outlying trials. The effect sizes versus sham, 
0.57 for shoulder and 0.83 for neck pain, were much larger than seen for low back pain, 
osteoarthritis and headache, although we also saw evidence that treatment benefits did not 
persist for neck pain.
Since publication of our results, there has been no substantive critique of our methodology 
in the peer-reviewed literature. The main issue under discussion seems to be whether the 
effect size of acupuncture is clinically relevant94, specifically, whether clinical relevance is 
determined by the comparison with no acupuncture control or by comparison with sham. We 
have previously argued in favor of the former, on the grounds that the clinical decision made 
by a referring clinician in discussion with their patient is not between acupuncture and sham 
but between acupuncture and no acupuncture. Our argument is given the context of the 
excellent safety profile of acupuncture66, evidence that the non-specific effects of 
acupuncture are particular to acupuncture and are not easily reproduced46, 54 and evidence 
provided here and elsewhere9 that some interventions used as sham acupuncture may be 
physiologically active.
It is also illustrative to compare our results to those of other interventions routinely used in 
clinical practice. For instance, in one meta-analysis of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 
(NSAIDs) for osteoarthritis of the knee, the effect size for NSAIDs vs placebo for trials that 
did not preselect NSAID responders was 0.23;10 for chronic low back pain, the effect size 
for NSAIDs is < 0.2029.
We find several implications for research. In terms of the methodology of subsequent 
acupuncture trials for chronic pain, we find that the balance of evidence is to give a higher 
dose of acupuncture in terms of a greater number of treatments in trials without sham 
control. Although the nature of the control group in trials will naturally be driven by the 
research question, investigators should be aware of the evidence that control arms that 
incorporate a relatively intense level of intervention, such as when acupuncture is added into 
an intensive rehabilitation regimen, tend to lead to smaller effect sizes, as do sham controls 
that involve needle penetration. Further research is warranted on whether acupuncture is 
particularly effective for upper body musculoskeletal pain. An associated hypothesis is 
whether there are subtypes of other chronic pain indications that have differential response 
to acupuncture. It would naturally be ideal to know before referring a patient for treatment 
whether, say, the type of back pain they are experiencing is one that would be amenable to 
treatment with acupuncture. We will also repeat our prior call for research on how best to 
incorporate acupuncture into the multidisciplinary care of chronic pain patients.
In terms of implications for clinical practice, we have confirmed that acupuncture has a 
clinically relevant, persistent effect on chronic pain that is not completely explained by

 placebo effects. Referral for a course of acupuncture treatment is therefore a reasonable 
option for a patient with chronic pain.

 Highlights
•
Acupuncture has a clinically relevant effect on chronic pain that persists over 
time
•
The effect of acupuncture cannot be explained only by placebo effects
•
Factors in addition to the specific effects of needling are important 
contributors
•
Referral for acupuncture treatment is a reasonable option for chronic pain 
patients

 Perspective
Acupuncture is effective for the treatment of chronic musculosketal, headache and 
osteoarthritis pain. Treatment effects of acupuncture persist over time and cannot be 
explained solely in terms of placebo effects. Referral for a course of acupuncture 
treatment is a reasonable option for a patient with chronic pain.
