ABSTRACT
Infectious diseases can alter the demography of their host populations, reducing their
viability even in the absence of mass mortality. Amphibians are the most threatened
group of vertebrates globally, and emerging infectious diseases play a large role
in their continued population declines. Viruses belonging to the genus Ranavirus are
responsible for one of the deadliest and most widespread of these diseases. To date,
no work has used individual level data to investigate how ranaviruses affect
population demographic structure. We used skeletochronology and morphology
to evaluate the impact of ranaviruses on the age structure of populations of the
European common frog (Rana temporaria) in the UK. We compared ecologically
similar populations that differed most notably in their historical presence or absence
of ranavirosis (the acute syndrome caused by ranavirus infection). Our results
suggest that ranavirosis may truncate the age structure of R. temporaria populations.
One potential explanation for such a shift might be increased adult mortality
and subsequent shifts in the life history of younger age classes that increase
reproductive output earlier in life. Additionally, we constructed population projection
models which indicated that such increased adult mortality could heighten the
vulnerability of frog populations to stochastic environmental challenges.

INTRODUCTION
The emergence of infectious diseases can truncate the age structure of host populations
(Jones et al., 2008; Lachish, McCallum & Jones, 2009; Ohlberger et al., 2011;
Fitzpatrick et al., 2014). Within age-structured populations, such truncation is

 primarily caused by compensatory changes in the vital rates (rates of growth, fecundity,
and survival) of younger age classes which occur in response to elevated levels of
extrinsic adult mortality (death of adult animals attributable to external factors such as
disease or predation; Stearns, 1992; Roff, 1993). To maximise individual fitness within
an environment of high extrinsic adult mortality, selection for increased developmental
rates, decreased size, and age at sexual maturity, and an increased adult life span
(decreased intrinsic adult mortality) will occur (Stearns et al., 2000). This theory has been
empirically borne out in a number of systems in response to several different sources of
mortality, including predation (Reznick, Bryga & Endler, 1990), over-harvesting
(Olsen et al., 2004), and experimentally induced adult mortality (Stearns et al., 2000).
Changes to population demography can have profound impacts on the growth and
stability of infected populations (Saether & Bakke, 2000). This phenomenon has recently
been demonstrated by Scheele et al. (2016), who documented high adult mortality and
associated truncation of population age structure in alpine tree frog (Litoria verreauxii
alpina) populations infected with the lethal fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium
dendrobatidis. Populations with truncated age structure were shown to be more vulnerable
to decline due to stochastic recruitment failure than B. dendrobatidis-free populations
(Scheele et al., 2016). These results highlight an important, yet relatively unexplored
mechanism by which infectious diseases can negatively affect their hosts.
Infectious diseases are emerging at a faster rate and threatening a larger range of
species than at any prior point in history (Jones, Patel & Levy, 2008). Therefore, it is
imperative to better understand demographic shifts associated with disease, and their
consequence for population viability, particularly in species of conservation concern.
Worldwide, amphibians are the most imperilled class of vertebrates (Wake &
Vredenburg, 2008). Aside from threats such as habitat loss (Cushman, 2006),
over-harvesting (Xie et al., 2007), and climate change (Foden et al., 2013), one major
driver of amphibian declines is the emergence of a suite of infectious diseases
(Daszak et al., 1999). One of the most widespread and deadly of these diseases, ranavirosis,
is caused by viral pathogens belonging to the genus Ranavirus (Chinchar, 2002;
Green, Converse & Schrader, 2002). Ranaviruses are globally distributed and are capable of
infecting and killing a wide range of species from three classes of ectothermic vertebrates
(Amphibians, Cunningham et al., 1996; Fish, Whittington, Becker & Dennis, 2010;
Reptiles, Marschang, 2011). Clinical ranavirosis is often characterised by severe dermal
ulcerations (Cunningham et al., 1996), as well as haemorrhaging and lesions affecting
the internal organs (Cunningham et al., 1996; Bayley, Hill & Feist, 2013). At the population
level, acute incidences of ranavirosis often manifest in mass mortality events, with
extreme or complete population mortality reported in some instances (Green,
Converse & Schrader, 2002; Wheelwright et al., 2014). Evidence from the UK shows
that following an episode of mass mortality due to ranavirosis European common frog
(Rana temporaria) populations can decline in size by more than 80% (Teacher,
Cunningham & Garner, 2010). Though population recovery has been observed in
some instances, often population size remains supressed, and some populations decline
to local extinction (Teacher, Cunningham & Garner, 2010). Campbell et al. (2018)

 demonstrated that ranaviruses are potentially more widespread than previously
thought, and present within the environment even when resident frog populations
show no overt signs of disease. These findings suggests that whether or not an outbreak
of ranavirosis occurs may depend on currently unknown biotic or abiotic factors of an
environment, although there is evidence for a role of the cutaneous or environmental
microbiome (Campbell et al., 2018), secondary host species, and chemical usage
(North et al., 2015). Susceptibility to ranavirosis outbreaks varies among species, but a
number of ecological risk factors, including life history strategy (the species specific cycle of
growth, maturation, reproduction and death), have been identified (Hoverman et al.,
2011). To date, no work has evaluated the impact of ranavirosis on the demographic
structure of host populations using individual age data.
In this study, we used a unique comparative field system born out of the Frog Mortality
Project (FMP; see Teacher, Cunningham & Garner, 2010; Price et al., 2016 for details)
to study the impacts of ranaviral disease history on the demographic structure of wild
R. temporaria populations in the UK. Unlike in most other species of susceptible
amphibian, ranavirosis disproportionately kills adult R. temporaria, rather than tadpoles
(Duffus, Nichols & Garner, 2013). We determined population age structure using
skeletochronology (age determination by counting skeletal growth rings) to test the
hypothesis that a history of ranavirosis truncates the age structure of R. temporaria
populations. Additionally, we investigated potential mechanisms for such age truncation
by using morphometric data to explore if frogs originating from populations with a
history of ranavirosis display reduced body size or evidence of more rapid
growth compared to their counterparts from ostensibly disease-free populations.
Finally, to examine the potential effect of the demographic impacts of ranavirosis, we
used population projection modelling to simulate the dynamics of hypothetical
R. temporaria populations under a range of stochastic environmental scenarios that
impact recruitment, adult survival, or both. Based on previous evidence (Ohlberger
et al., 2011; Rouyer et al., 2012; Scheele et al., 2016), we hypothesised that age structure
truncation would heighten the vulnerability of R. temporaria populations to
environmental stochasticity.
METHODS
Ethics statement
This project was approved by the ethics boards of both the University of Exeter
and Zoological Society of London and conducted under UK Home Office project
license 80/2466. All field sampling was conducted under the personal Home Office
license 30/10730 issued to Lewis Campbell.
Field sampling
Evidence from the same populations studied herein suggests that ranaviruses may be
more ubiquitous within amphibian populations in the UK than previously thought,
being detectable even in populations with no history of ranavirosis (Campbell et al., 2018).
We therefore used a history of ranavirosis related mortality (or lack of), rather than

 detectable ranavirus burden, to differentiate between populations that are impacted by
ranaviruses and those which are not. Candidate R. temporaria populations were identified
using the FMP database of privately owned fieldsites that have experienced at least
one R. temporaria mass mortality event due to ranavirosis and a complimentary database
of fieldssites thought to have not experienced a ranavirosis outbreak, based upon
information provided by fieldsite owners. All fieldsites were urban or sub-urban gardens,
distributed throughout Southern England (Fig. 1). Although sizes varied, all fieldsites
contained an artificially constructed pond. Site owners reported that neither their
gardens nor ponds were treated with any chemicals which could harm the resident
R. temporaria populations.
Briefly, ranavirosis-positive fieldsites were classified as such if they had experienced a
confirmed ranavirosis mass mortality event between 1997 and 1998 and ongoing discovery
of frog carcasses with symptoms consistent with ranavirosis was reported by property
owners to Teacher, Cunningham & Garner (2010). Ranaviruses were confirmed as the
causative agents of mortality within these populations using a combination of post-mortem
pathological examination of frog carcasses and molecular diagnostic techniques
(Teacher, Cunningham & Garner, 2010). In order to be classified as disease-free, fieldsites
must have been owned or occupied by the same people at all times since 1997 and have

 contained a well-monitored R. temporaria population for at least as long. Owners/occupiers
of disease-free fieldsites must not have observed any signs or symptoms of ranavirosis at
any time. See Teacher, Cunningham & Garner (2010) for more detailed fieldsite selection
criteria. Fieldsite proprietors were contacted to establish their willingness to be involved in
this study. Five ranavirosis populations were successfully recruited and matched with five
populations that have remained disease-free (Fig. 1). None of our ranavirosis-positive
populations had experienced a mass mortality event within the last decade.
Fieldsites were surveyed during the spring breeding season of 2015, with each site sampled
on a single day. Sampling involved opportunistic searching for frogs within and around the
perimeter of the breeding ponds. Captured frogs were placed into plastic holding tanks
before sampling, which took place in situ. To ensure sampling effort between populations was
as equal as possible, searching took place during a 1 h, mid-morning time window.
Snout to vent length (SVL) was measured using 0.1 mm scale callipers and the distal
portion of the 1st digit of a hind limb was clipped using surgical scissors. A topical disinfectant
that contained an analgesic (Bactine; WellSpring Pharmaceutical, Sarasota, FL, USA) was
applied to the surgical area prior to the procedure. Toe clips were placed into individual
1.5 ml micro-centrifuge tubes containing 1 ml of 70% ethanol. Following sampling,
all animals were released at point of capture. The number of individuals sampled in each
population varied between 4 (Witham) and 61 (Mitcham and Palmer‚Äôs Green) with a mean of
30 animals sampled per site (Table S1). All captured frogs were considered to be part of the
breeding population, as juvenile frogs rarely return to breeding ponds (Wilbur, 1980;
Verrell, 1985), and all sampled individuals were found to be over the minimum known age
of sexual maturity for the study species (Gibbons, 1983; Miaud, Guy√©tant & Elmberg, 1999).
Age determination
The age of each frog was determined by skeletochronology, which has been calibrated
and demonstrated as a reliable method of determining the age of northern
European R. temporaria in several previous studies (Gibbons, 1983; Gibbons & McCarthy,
1986; Ryser, 1996; Miaud, Guy√©tant & Elmberg, 1999). We followed the protocol for
aging R. temporaria from (Miaud, Guy√©tant & Elmberg, 1999) with the following
modifications. The phalangeal bone was separated from soft tissues, decalcified with
5% nitric acid for 1.5 h, and washed with water over night. Cross sections (12 mm thick)
were then cut from the bone using a cryostat and stained using haematoxylin for
20 min. Lines of arrested growth (LAG) were counted using a light microscope at
200‚Äì400ÔøΩ magnification, 10‚Äì12 sections were analysed for each individual and
two different researchers verified counts. Age at sexual maturity was determined as the
youngest age at which inter-LAG space reduced in size, as juvenile inter-LAG space is
significantly wider than post-sexual maturity (Sinsch, 2015).
Statistical analyses
Body size by age and age at sexual maturity
We conducted all statistical modelling in R (R Core Team, 2014). We used linear mixed
effects regression (lmer) models, implemented in the package lme4 (Bates et al., 2015),
Campbell et al. (2018), PeerJ, DOI 10.7717/peerj.5949

 fitted with a Gaussian error structure, and a stepwise simplification procedure to
investigate the impact of population ranavirosis history on the body size (SVL) of
R. temporaria. Age, ranaviral disease history of the source population (a two level binary
factor) and their interaction were fitted as fixed effects. We controlled for variation in
SVL between sampled populations by the inclusion of population of origin as a
random effect, applied to the intercepts (Table 1). Since male and female frogs grow at
different rates (Gibbons, 1983; Ryser, 1996; Miaud, Guy√©tant & Elmberg, 1999), the datasets
of each sex were analysed separately.
A separate lmer model was fitted to investigate the impact of ranavirosis history status
of the source population on age at sexual maturity. In the full model, age at maturity
was fitted as the response variable, ranaviral disease history of source population as a
fixed effect and source population as a random effect. As female R. temporaria mature later
than males (Gibbons, 1983, Miaud, Guy√©tant & Elmberg, 1999), the datasets of
each sex were analysed separately.
Influence of ranavirus on population age structure
The impact of disease status on the age structure of R. temporaria populations was
investigated using a Bayesian ordinal mixed effects model in the package MCMCglmm
(Hadfield, 2010). We fitted age class as an ordinal response variable (nine discrete classes,
ages 2‚Äì10 years), disease status of the source population as the fixed effect, and source

 population as a random effect. We used uninformative priors for both the random
effect (G) and residual variance (R) structures, but fixed the residual variance at 1 as this
quantity cannot be estimated in ordinal models (Hadfield, 2010, 2018). The model was
run for a total of 600,000 iterations with a burn-in period of 100,000 iterations and a
thinning rate of 500, giving a final sample of 1,000 draws from the posterior distributions.
We assessed model convergence using the Gelman‚ÄìRubin (G‚ÄìR) statistic calculated
from three independent chains initiated with overdispersed starting values. All G‚ÄìR values
were <1.05, indicating convergence. Mean probability of membership and associated
95% credible intervals for each age class were calculated from the linear predictor, for each
of the two disease history groups. Age structure plots (Fig. 2) suggest that observed changes
were similar for both sexes, so the dataset was not split by sex.
Population matrix modelling
To investigate how changes in population age structure, as well as scenarios that can
bring about such changes, can impact the dynamics and stability of R. temporaria
populations, we constructed population matrix models. Comprehensive methodologies of
our matrix modelling can be found in our supplementary methods section (Methods S1).
However, in brief, we created hypothetical R. temporaria populations of 150 sexually
mature female animals and projected these populations 20 years into the future based on
two matrices which represented potential vital rates at ranavirosis-positive R. temporaria
population (increasing annual mortality in each adult age class) and a disease-free
R. temporaria population (uniform adult mortality). We populated these matrices
using the vital rates for R. temporaria published by Biek et al. (2002) except that we
increased the fecundity of each post sexual maturity age class of R. temporaria by 50 eggs
compared to the previous age class. Theoretical clutch sizes ranged from 250 eggs per year

 per 2-year-old adults to 650 eggs per year per 10-year-old adults. This increase was done
according to age by size data collected for this study and previously published work
showing that the clutch sizes of R. temporaria are tightly positively correlated with female
body size with a >3 fold increase between individuals of 50 mm versus individuals of
80 mm (Gibbons & McCarthy, 1986). To analyse the impact of these adjustments
we compared the sensitives of our adjusted matrices to one constructed with the
unadjusted vital rates of Biek et al. (2002). As previous evidence has shown that disease
induced demographic shifts or the changes in vital rates which may bring them about
can increase susceptibility to environmental change (Rouyer et al., 2012; Scheele
et al., 2017) we then modelled our populations in environmentally stochastic scenarios
which incorporated processes which may result in annual reproductive failure, mass
mortality, or in extreme cases, both simultaneously.
RESULTS
Body size by age and age at sexual maturity
We sampled 208 male and 66 female frogs, of which 103 males and 31 females were
sampled at ranavirosis-positive populations. A break-down of the number of frogs
sampled per each population can be found in Table S1. For both sexes, age had a significant
effect on SVL (males; df = 4, Chi2 = 186.38, p < 0.001, females; df = 4, Chi2 = 47.16,
p < 0.001; Fig. S1; Table 1). Mean age at sexual maturity of males from ranavirosis-positive
populations (n = 57) was 2.6 years (¬± SE 0.07) and from disease-free populations
(n = 59) it was 2.8 years (¬± SE 0.06). Mean age at sexual maturity of females from
ranavirosis-positive populations (n = 19) was 3.2 years (¬± SE 0.13) and for females from
disease-free populations (n = 17) it was 3.3 years (¬± SE 0.10), and all differences were
non-significant (Fig. S2; Table 1).
Influence of ranavirosis on population age structure
The mean age of males from ranavirosis-positive populations was 4.8-years-old (¬± SE 0.16)
compared to an average age of 6.3 years (¬± SE 0.13) at disease-free populations.
Mean female age at ranavirosis-positive populations was 5.3 years (¬± SE 0.28)
compared to 6.6 years (¬± SE 0.26) at disease-free populations.
Disease history had a significant effect on population age structure (effect size -1.43,
95% credible intervals -2.37, -0.38, p = 0.008; Fig. 2). We found populations with a
positive history of ranavirosis to be dominated by younger R. temporaria. We calculated
the difference in posterior probabilities of belonging to an age class based upon disease
history status by subtracting the posterior probability of a frog of age X being encountered
at ranavirosis-positive population from the posterior probability of a frog of age
X being found at a disease-free population. The resulting difference values show that
adults aged 2‚Äì5 years old are more likely to be encountered in positive disease history
populations, and those aged 6‚Äì10 years old are more likely to be observed at populations
where no disease has been recorded (Fig. 3). Differences in age distributions were
strongly supported for all age classes (95% credible intervals of difference do not
cross zero) except for 6-year-olds. Although 6-year-old frogs were more likely to be

 observed in disease-free populations, the 95% credible intervals incorporated 0
(mean difference = -14.41, 95% CI [-30.45 ‚Äì 3.96]; Fig. 3).
Population projection modelling
When projected based upon a matrix with constant annual adult survival, both disease-free
and ranavirosis-positive population vectors showed similar population dynamics.
Population growth initially spiked due to an influx of pre-mature age classes into the
population. This initial growth was followed by a period of attenuating oscillation,
before reaching equilibrium at around the 15th year (Fig. S3). Projected populations
starting with a truncated age structure obtained smaller population sizes per each year,
however, this difference was non-significant (Fig. S3, ANOVA; df = 1, F = 0.935, p = 0.34).
Projecting either starting population vector using a matrix incorporating reduced
annual adult survival resulted in the same pattern of population growth but further
reduced population sizes per year, with the lowest annual population sizes obtained by an
age truncated population projected with decreased annual adult survival, though this
reduction was again non-significant (Fig. S3; ANOVA; df = 3, F = 0.99, p = 0.39).
Elasticity analysis showed that both disease-free and ranavirosis-positive matrices
were similarly sensitive to the same matrix elements. However, the decreased annual adult
survival incorporated into our ranavirosis-positive matrix rendered that matrix marginally
more sensitive to fluctuations in survival of larval, juvenile and 2-year-old life stages.
Sensitivity to survival of all subsequent adult age classes was higher in our disease-free
population matrix (Fig. S4). Similarly, our ranavirosis-positive matrix was more sensitive
to changes in the fecundity of 2, 3 and 4 year old breeding adults, whereas sensitivity

97.5%) credible intervals that do not span zero suggests that influence of disease history on that age class
is significantly supported by our model. This is the case for all classes other than age 6 which although
found to be observed more often in disease-free populations has credible intervals spanning 0.

 to changes in fecundity of older adult age classes was higher in our disease-free
population matrix (Fig. S5). In concordance with the matrix constructed using
the unadjusted vital rates of Biek et al. (2002), both of our altered matrices were most
sensitive to fluctuations in the summed vital rates of post metamorphic R. temporaria life
stages, though larval survival demonstrated the highest or second highest individual
elasticity in all matrices (Fig. S4). The most noticeable dissimilarity between our adjusted
matrices and the unadjusted matrix was that matrix sensitivity was distributed
more evenly between the fecundity of all adult age classes in the former, whereas the
unadjusted matrix was extremely sensitive to the fecundity of 2-year-old breeding adults
(Fig. S5).
Our stochastic projection models showed that disease-free populations subject to a 10%
probability of recruitment failure per year were still able to consistently attain population
sizes near carrying capacity much more often than ranavirosis-positive populations
subjected to the same scenario, which attained a more variable array of population sizes
(Fig. 4; Table 2). The inclusion of potential ranavirosis mass mortality events further
destabilised ranavirosis-positive populations and under a scenario when both adult mass
mortality and reproductive failure could occur within the same year populations were
driven locally extinct in 58% of model iterations (Fig. 4; Table 2).

 DISCUSSION
The impact of disease on population demographics
Our results illustrate that a history of ranavirosis can have a significant effect on the age
structure of a population. We found that older R. temporaria (aged 6‚Äì10 years) are
significantly less likely to be found within populations with a positive history of ranavirosis
than they are in disease-free populations. Since none of our sampled populations have
experienced a significant mass mortality event within the lifetime of any of the sampled
frogs (‚àº10 years), this suggests a pattern of attritional mortality in ranavirosis-positive
populations, rather than the sudden and catastrophic loss of any particular age classes.
Attritional mortality of adults is consistent with our knowledge of ranavirosis in
R. temporaria. First, R. temporaria are highly philopatric (Brabec et al., 2009), and our study
populations occupy permanent, urban, or semi-urban garden ponds (Teacher, Cunningham &
Garner, 2010; Price et al., 2016). Ranaviruses have been shown to persist in such
water bodies (Nazir, Spengler & Marschang, 2012), particularly in the presence of secondary
host species such as fish or other, less susceptible, amphibian species (Hoverman et al., 2011;
North et al., 2015). None of our fieldsites supported natural or stocked populations of
fish, however, we did encounter the common toad (Bufo bufo) at one population of
each disease status. The presence or absence of secondary hosts therefore does not represent
a consistent confounding variable between our disease history groups. Second, mortality
due to ranavirosis is annually recurrent (Daszak et al., 1999; Teacher, Cunningham &
Garner, 2010), and unlike all other host-ranavirus systems, infection in the UK primarily
affects adult life stages of R. temporaria (Cunningham et al., 1996; Duffus, Nichols & Garner,
2013). Third, adaptive immune response to ranaviruses are apparently limited in
R. temporaria (Price et al., 2015; Campbell et al., 2018). Consequently, it is possible that adult
mortality within populations with a history of ranavirosis is maintained in such a way
that an individual is more likely to become infected and succumb to ranavirosis the more
often it returns to spawn. Such a scenario would explain the decreased likelihood of
observing individuals older than 5 years of age in populations with a history of ranavirosis.
Concurrently, we found that a significantly higher number of 2‚Äì5 year old frogs
were captured at disease-free populations than at populations with a history of ranavirosis.

 Life history theory predicts that the first compensatory response to high adult mortality
should come in the survival rates of lower age classes (Stearns, 1992). We lack any
data on the immature age classes present at our study populations and the snapshot nature
of our study means we cannot draw inference on whether the survival rates of
younger adult age classes are increased in ranavirosis-positive populations. However, it is
plausible that such an increase could result in the observed increased abundance of
younger animals.
Empirical studies conducted on populations of other vertebrates subjected to persistent
infectious diseases have detected a reduction in the age or size at sexual maturity within
diseased populations (Jones et al., 2008; Lachish, McCallum & Jones, 2009; Ohlberger
et al., 2011; Fitzpatrick et al., 2014). As such, we hypothesised that R. temporaria
originating from populations where ranavirosis causes increased adult mortality would
reach sexual maturity at an earlier age than frogs from disease-free populations. We also
hypothesised that a trade-off in the allocation of resources to early reproduction,
away from growth, would cause frogs from ranavirosis-positive populations to attain a
lower body size per age than those from disease-free populations. However, we found
that a positive history of ranavirosis is not associated with a significant impact on either age
at sexual maturity or body size throughout life. These findings are in contrast with the
findings of (Scheele et al., 2017) who found that an infectious disease (B. dendrobatidis)
reduced the size and age at sexual maturity of L. v. alpina.
The age at which R. temporaria mature is intrinsically linked to attaining a
minimum body length needed to successfully reproduce (Ryser, 1996; Miaud, Guy√©tant &
Elmberg, 1999). The age at which this length is attained has been shown to be heavily
influenced by several environmental factors such as photo-period and altitude
(Miaud, Guy√©tant & Elmberg, 1999). All frogs in our study were found to mature at
either 2, 3, or 4 years of age and this is consistent with the findings of other similar studies
on R. temporaria (Gibbons, 1983; Ryser, 1996; Miaud, Guy√©tant & Elmberg, 1999).
In fact, no previous study has found male or female R. temporaria to reach maturity
younger than 2 years of age and post-sexual maturity there is little detectable trade-off
between growth and fecundity in response to sub-prime environments (Lardner & Loman,
2003). This evidence suggests that the life history strategy of R. temporaria may already be
optimised to generate maximum reproductive fitness in light of other environmental
factors and that scope for further plasticity in traits such as age at sexual maturity and
subsequent growth rate in response to diseases may be minimal.
Given the apparent lack of compensatory change in the onset of sexual maturity an
alternative explanation for the fact that we encountered 2- and 3-year-old breeding frogs at
ranavirosis-positive populations but not disease-free populations may be behavioural
changes that enhance the life time reproductive success of individuals in the face of
high adult mortality. Participation in spawning events in exposed aquatic environments is
associated with a significant mortality risk to an individual, caused either by exposure to
predation or the act of mating itself (Beebee, 1996). Additionally, smaller R. temporaria
present in breeding populations are easily outcompeted by larger individuals, who are
better able to secure a mate and achieve amplexus (Gibbons, 1983). The loss of larger, more
Campbell et al. (2018), PeerJ, DOI 10.7717/peerj.5949
12/20
 competitive individuals at ranavirosis-positive fieldsites may release smaller R. temporaria
from this intraspecific competitive pressure. Increased opportunity for less competitive
individuals to participate successfully in reproductive events may result in animals that
would normally defer breeding until subsequent years or larger body sizes attempting to
reproduce earlier. Additionally, in environments of high adult mortality the number of
lifetime reproductive events is potentially limited. In such environments lifetime
reproductive success is likely higher when an individual exploits all possible chances to
produce offspring. Thus smaller, less competitive individuals may attempt to breed earlier
than they would do in the absence of disease induced mortality, irrespective of the odds of
being out competed by older/larger frogs.
Any or all of the potential processes outlined above could lead to the observed
truncation of age structures in R. temporaria populations with a history of ranavirosis.
While our results provide strong evidence of such truncation, they are based on data
collected from adult R. temporaria sampled during one breeding season. As such we are
unable to draw conclusions as to the mechanisms which drive observed changes to
population age structure. Additionally, due to the correlational nature of our study
we are unable to emphatically exclude the possibility that the age structure truncation
we observed is attributable to some other unmeasured variable between our studied
populations. Although the lack of systematic differences between our fieldsites other
than disease history suggests that this is unlikely. Nevertheless, our results highlight a
potentially important and as yet unexplored facet of the relationship between ranaviruses
and their amphibian hosts. The impact of demographic shifts has been demonstrated
in a number of study systems (Jones et al., 2008; Lachish, McCallum & Jones, 2009;
Ohlberger et al., 2011; Rouyer et al., 2012; Scheele et al., 2016) and as such the relationship
between ranaviruses and population demographics undoubtedly warrants further
investigation. A long-term, mark-recapture study within the same populations used
here would likely prove a critical first step in elucidating the mechanisms which bring
about shifts in R. temporaria population age structure.
The potential impact of disease on the viability of populations
Previous investigations have shown that age structure truncation, associated with an
emerging pathogen, severely reduces the viability of host populations, particularly
under variable environmental conditions (Scheele et al., 2016). We used population matrix
models to probe the potential impacts of a truncated age structure, and the demographic
processes which may bring about such changes, on the viability of R. temporaria
populations in the UK. Additionally, we introduced environmental stochasticity into
our models in order to explore the combined impact of these two challenges
simultaneously.
When modelled in the absence of increased adult mortality due to ranavirosis,
starting population vectors representing both a disease-free population and a
ranavirosis-positive population (truncated age structure) exhibited minimal difference
in their dynamics. This finding suggests that the level of age structure truncation
we document is unlikely to reduce the viability of R. temporaria populations. The same was
Campbell et al. (2018), PeerJ, DOI 10.7717/peerj.5949
13/20
 true when both population age structures were modelled in the presence of increasing
adult mortality due to ranavirosis, suggesting that even under such conditions the
relatively high survival of pre-metamorphic, juvenile and young adult age classes is enough
to maintain population viability. This suggestion is supported by the elasticity of our
population matrices which demonstrated that the survival of tadpoles, juveniles and
early adult life stages have higher predicted impact on the population growth dynamics of
our populations than the survival of older adult age classes. This result is supportive
of the findings of other investigations of amphibian population dynamics (Biek et al., 2002;
Earl & Gray, 2014).
However, under environmentally stochastic scenarios, where recruitment was reduced,
populations that were subjected to increasing adult mortality due to ranavirosis faired
much worse than ranavirosis-free populations. These results are consistent with previous
observations of age structure truncation increasing the vulnerability of populations to
environmental stochasticity (Ohlberger et al., 2011; Rouyer et al., 2012; Scheele et al., 2016).
Body size, age and fecundity are positively correlated in R. temporaria (Gibbons &
McCarthy, 1986), as well as in many other species (Blueweiss et al., 1978; Honƒõk, 1993;
Trippel, 1993; Sand, 1996; Penteriani, Balbontin & Ferrer, 2003). The relative absence of the
oldest and largest breeding animals from disease positive populations means that
per capita fecundity will be reduced and annual recruitment rates lowered. Such changes
likely heighten the impacts of any events that result in failed recruitment or further
adult mortality.
It is important to note that our matrix models are approximations of the populations
that they represent, and the results of our models are therefore demonstrative of potential
additional impacts of ranavirosis, rather than definitively demonstrating the existence
of such impacts. Although our simulations are based on published literature, they
necessarily incorporate several assumptions. A key assumption in our models is the
number of eggs produced per each individual, per each adult year of age. Although we have
strong grounds to suggest that fecundity of female R. temporaria increases with age and
size, the number of eggs produced by each frog of a given age or size is unknown in
our study populations. If a larger number of eggs are produced than represented by our
matrices, it may be that the impact of stochastic recruitment failure upon our populations
is reduced and vice versa. Similarly, we reduce the survival of each adult age class
into the next by 5% for each year of development post-sexual maturity. Whilst we found
no impact of the amount by which we reduced this annual survival parameter on the
dynamics of our modelled populations, in reality survival may not decrease annually in
such a uniform manner. Finally, we set an upper limit for our theoretical populations
of 150 female animals. However, due to the nature of our fieldsites we lack the ability to
make accurate estimations of actual population sizes at our studied populations.
Larger actual population sizes may buffer populations against the potential impacts that we
have demonstrated but smaller actual population sizes may mean that the potential
demographic impacts of ranavirosis may be even more consequential for R. temporaria
populations. Further investigation of the life history traits and an accurate estimation
of sizes of our study populations would allow for more robust parameterisation of our
Campbell et al. (2018), PeerJ, DOI 10.7717/peerj.5949
14/20
 models and the ability to more accurately predict the impact of ongoing ranavirosis
within them.
Despite these limitations, our population models corroborate previous empirical data
collected from within our study system. A long-term study of population sizes has shown
that following an outbreak of ranavirosis, characterised by a mass mortality event,
UK R. temporaria populations follow three possible trajectories. These are: (1) complete
recovery to post outbreak population levels, (2) persistence at a largely reduced population
size, or (3) local extinction (Teacher, Cunningham & Garner, 2010). Our simulated
R. temporaria populations were projected to population sizes that incorporate all of these
possible outcomes, dependant on the levels of environmental stochasticity to which a
population was subjected. Importantly, our simulations suggest that the fate of a
population subjected to ranavirosis may depend heavily upon the stability of its
environment, providing a potential explanation as to why some populations appear to
persist with endemic infectious disease, while others are driven to local extirpation.
The importance of variations in fecundity in population models
Variations in adult fecundity due to body size are often not included in population
projection modelling (Briggs et al., 2005; but see Zambrano et al., 2007). However, our
results highlight the importance of considering age or body size specific changes
in fecundity in population modelling, particularly when considered threats
disproportionately impact certain age classes. Ensuring matrix models of populations
represent the life history of the study species as closely as possible is essential,
especially when seeking to inform conservation or policy decision making.
CONCLUSION
Our results highlight an increasing need to better understand the impact of disease
on the demography of host populations and the processes which can bring about such
demographic shifts. Further investigation of this relationship, possibly via a long-term
mark-recapture study on the same populations used here could help elucidate the
exact mechanisms responsible for age structure truncation in R. temporaria populations.
This work also further suggests that the emergence of an infectious disease within a
population can heighten its vulnerability to external stressors. Although the theoretical
stressor incorporated into our models was environmental stochasticity, the same is likely to
be true for all types of stressor including anthropogenic. This result is timely given
that we live in a time of unprecedented disease emergence and anthropogenic change
(Daszak, Cunningham & Hyatt, 2001).
