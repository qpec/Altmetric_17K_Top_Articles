BACKGROUND & AIMS:
Use of targeted mass spectrometry (MS)-based methods is increasing in clinical chemistry
laboratories. We investigate whether MS-based profiling of plasma improves noninvasive risk
estimates of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) compared with routinely available clinical
parameters and patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 3 (PNPLA3) genotype at
rs738409.
METHODS:
We used MS-based analytic platforms to measure levels of lipids and metabolites in blood
samples from 318 subjects who underwent a liver biopsy because of suspected NASH. The
subjects were divided randomly into estimation (n [ 223) and validation (n [ 95) groups to
build and validate the model. Gibbs sampling and stepwise logistic regression, which fulfilled
the Bayesian information criterion, were used for variable selection and modeling.
RESULTS:
Features of the metabolic syndrome and the variant in PNPLA3 encoding I148M were significantly
more common among subjects with than without NASH. We developed a model to identify subjects
with NASH based on clinical data and PNPLA3 genotype (NASH Clin Score), which included
aspartate aminotransferase (AST), fasting insulin, and PNPLA3 genotype. This model identified
subjects with NASH with an area under the receiver operating characteristic of 0.778 (95% con-
fidence interval, 0.709–0.846). We then used backward stepwise logistic regression analyses of
variables from the NASH Clin Score and MS-based factors associated with NASH to develop the
NASH ClinLipMet Score. This included glutamate, isoleucine, glycine, lysophosphatidylcholine 16:0,
phosphoethanolamine 40:6, AST, and fasting insulin, along with PNPLA3 genotype. It identified
patients with NASH with an area under the receiver operating characteristic of 0.866 (95% con-
fidence interval, 0.820–0.913). The NASH ClinLipMet score identified patients with NASH with
significantly higher accuracy than the NASH Clin Score or MS-based profiling alone.
CONCLUSIONS:
A score based on MS (glutamate, isoleucine, glycine, lysophosphatidylcholine 16:0, phosphoe-
thanolamine 40:6) and knowledge of AST, fasting insulin, and PNPLA3 genotype is significantly
better than a score based on clinical or metabolic profiles alone in determining the risk of NASH.

 T
he spectrum of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease
(NAFLD) ranges from the nonalcoholic fatty liver
(NAFL) to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which
increases the risk of cirrhosis and mortality from
liver disease.1 Only a fraction of patients with NAFLD
progress to NASH, of which the diagnosis requires a
liver biopsy. Thus, there is a need to develop noninvasive
tools to identify patients, who might be at risk of having
NASH.
Factors such as age, sex, liver enzymes, components
of the metabolic syndrome (MetS), as well as circulating
markers of inflammation, fibrosis, apoptosis, and extra-
cellular matrix components, have been shown to be
associated with NASH.1 Genetic factors, especially the
I148M variant in patatin-like phospholipase domain-
containing protein 3 (PNPLA3), also confers suscepti-
bility to NASH.1
Ultra-performance
liquid
chromatography
mass
spectrometry (UPLC-MS)-based techniques are rapidly
entering clinical chemistry laboratories and replacing
many conventional techniques.2 Few data are available
regarding such approaches to identify new markers for
noninvasive estimation of the risk of NASH. In 24 obese
patients with NASH, 11 with steatosis, and 25 lean
controls, who did not undergo a liver biopsy, plasma
concentrations
of
glutamate
(Glu),
isoleucine
(Ile),
leucine (Leu), tyrosine (Tyr), and valine (Val) were
increased
significantly,
but
diagnostic
performance
compared with routinely available markers was not
examined.3 Barr et al4 characterized lipids and metabo-
lites in serum of 467 Caucasian patients and found
between 9 and 237 metabolites to be markers of NASH,
depending on the degree of obesity.
The human liver lipidome differs markedly between
subjects with NAFLD associated with insulin resistance
(IR NAFLD) compared with those without, and between
subjects with NAFLD and the PNPLA3 I148M genotype
(PNPLA3 NAFLD) compared with those lacking the gene
variant.5 The liver lipidome is enriched markedly with
saturated and monounsaturated triglycerides and free
fatty acids in IR NAFLD, and with polyunsaturated tri-
glycerides in PNPLA3 NAFLD.5 These differences also
influence the circulating lipidome in NAFLD in subjects
whose liver fat content has been measured using proton
magnetic resonance spectroscopy but who have not un-
dergone a liver biopsy.6 However, there are no studies in
patients who have undergone a liver biopsy that would
have determined whether knowledge of the PNPLA3
genotype influences biomarkers of NASH as compared
with non-NASH (NAFL or normal liver histology) sub-
jects. Furthermore, to our knowledge, no study has
analyzed
whether
MS-based
markers
significantly
improve predictive performance of scores based on
routinely available physical and biochemical parameters.
In the present study, we developed scores based on the
following: (1) routinely available clinical parameters and
PNPLA3 genotype, (2) UPLC-MS analyses alone, and (3)
all available information for estimation of the risk of
NASH. The diagnostic performance of the 3 models then
was compared.
Materials and Methods
Study Subjects
Metabolic studies were conducted at the University of
Helsinki (Finland) and Antwerp University Hospital
(Belgium). A total of 318 subjects were recruited among
those referred to the Department of Gastroenterology
(Finland, n ¼ 54) because of chronically increased serum
aminotransferase
concentrations
and
among
those
referred for bariatric surgery in Belgium (n ¼ 193) and
Finland (n ¼ 71). Subjects were eligible if they met the
following criteria: (1) age 18 to 75 years; (2) no known
acute or chronic disease except for obesity or type 2
diabetes on the basis of medical history, physical exami-
nation, and standard laboratory tests (blood counts,
serum creatinine, thyroid-stimulating hormone, electro-
lyte concentrations) and electrocardiogram; and (3)
alcohol consumption less than 20 g/d. Hepatitis B surface
antigen, transferrin saturation, and antibodies against
hepatitis A and C and anti–smooth muscle, antinuclear,
and antimitochondrial antibodies were measured in all
patients referred to the gastroenterologist because of
chronically increased liver function tests using routine
methods of local laboratories. Patients were excluded if
they used thiazolidinediones or were pregnant. The study
protocol was approved by the ethics committees of the
Helsinki and the Antwerp University Hospitals. Each
participant provided written informed consent.
Metabolic Study
All subjects were invited to a clinical visit 1 week before
surgery for metabolic characterization after an overnight
fast. After anthropometric measurements (body weight,
height, and waist circumference), an intravenous cannula
was inserted in an antecubital vein for withdrawal of blood
for measurement of HbA1C, glycosylated hemoglobin 1c,
serum insulin and adiponectin, plasma glucose, low-
density lipoprotein and high-density lipoprotein (HDL)
cholesterol, triglyceride, total blood counts, albumin,
aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotrans-
ferase, alkaline phosphatase, g-glutamyl transpeptidase,
and albumin concentrations, and for genotyping of PNPLA3
at rs738409 as described.7 Blood sampling was performed
before intake of any medications.
Histologic Assessment
Immediately at the beginning of the surgery, wedge
biopsy specimens of the liver were obtained. The biopsy
specimens from Belgium were sent to Finland, where
1464 Zhou et al
Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology Vol. 14, No. 10
 they were assessed simultaneously with the Finnish
samples by an experienced liver pathologist in a blinded
fashion according to the criteria proposed by Brunt
et al.8 Liver fat was quantified as the percentage of
hepatocytes with macrovesicular steatosis.
Mass Spectrometry–Based Profiling
Lipidomic analysis. An unthawed plasma sample was
used from all subjects and extracted for lipidomic and
metabolomic analysis (see later). An established platform
based on acquity UPLC quadruple time-of-flight mass
spectrometry (Hertfordshire, UK) was used to analyze
the plasma samples. The data were processed by using
MZmine 2 software (Espoo, Finland)9 and the lipid
identification was based on an internal spectral library
(see Supplementary Methods section for more detail).
Metabolomic
analysis. Polar
metabolites
were
analyzed using comprehensive 2-dimensional gas chro-
matography combined with time-of-flight mass spec-
trometry (GC � GC-TOFMS) (see Supplementary Methods
section for more detail).
Other Analytic Procedures and Measurements
Body weight, waist circumference, blood pressure,
and fasting concentrations of plasma glucose, serum-free
insulin, lipids (HDL and low-density lipoprotein choles-
terol and triacylglycerols [TGs]), and liver enzyme (AST,
alanine
aminotransferase,
and
g-glutamyl
trans-
peptidase) concentrations were measured as previously
described.9 The MetS was defined and PNPLA3 at
rs739409 was genotyped as described.9
Statistical Analyses
Assessment of
abundances
of
triacylglycerol
spe-
cies. After log2 transformation, the average abundances
of TG molecules were compared between the NASH and
non-NASH groups by Student t tests. Multiple compar-
isons were corrected by using the Benjamini–Hochberg
method10 (see the Supplementary Methods for more
detail).
Cluster
analysis
of
lipidomics
data. Lipids
were
grouped by using Bayesian model-based clustering as
previously described.11
Diagnostic model. The biopsy subjects were divided
randomly into estimation (n ¼ 223) and validation
(n ¼ 95) groups to build and validate the model, respec-
tively (see later). All study subjects (n ¼ 318) were used as
the second validation group. The Shapiro–Wilk test was
used to test the normality of the distribution. The unpaired
t test or the Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to compare
the differences between the estimation and validation
groups. Normally distributed data are shown as means �
SEM and non-normally distributed data are shown as the
median followed by the 25th and 75th quartiles. Multiple
hypotheses
testing
was
performed
by
using
the
Benjamini–Hochberg10 false-discovery rate method to
calculate q-values. In data with a large number of variables
measured by UPLC, the Gibbs sampling algorithm was
used for simulation.12 After sampling 10,000 times, the
variables were selected among the models based on
Bayesian
information
criterion.
Logistic
regression
including all of the selected variables was used to build the
scores. Variables in the scores finally were assessed by
backward stepwise regression to identify the optimal
NASH score. The area under the receiver operating char-
acteristic curve (AUROC) was used to describe the diag-
nostic accuracy of the scores. The optimal cut-off point
was calculated using the Youden index. The sensitivity,
specificity, positive predictive values, and negative pre-
dictive values for relevant cut-off values were calculated
as described.6 The AUROCs were compared using the
generalized U-statistics.13 One-way analysis of variance
was used to compare 3 groups. The Tukey Honestly
Significant Differences test was used for post hoc analyses.
A 2-sided P value of less than .05 was considered statis-
tically significant. The statistical analyses were performed
using R version 3.0.1 (http://www.r-project.org/).
Results
Characteristics of the Study Groups
Comparison of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and non-
nonalcoholic
steatohepatitis
groups. Characteristics of
the NASH and non-NASH groups are shown in Table 1.
Liver fat content and all liver enzyme levels were
significantly higher in the NASH than in the non-NASH
group (Table 1). Features of the MetS (hyperglycemia,
hypertriglyceridemia,
hypertension,
and
low
HDL
cholesterol) were significantly more common in the
NASH than in the non-NASH group. The NASH group had
a significantly increased prevalence of the PNPLA I148M
variant compared with the non-NASH group (P < .001).
These significances remained significant after adjusting
for age (data not shown).
Comparison of estimation and validation groups. The
estimation and validation groups were comparable with
respect to clinical and biochemical features such as age,
sex, body mass index, components of the MetS, preva-
lence of NASH, liver fat, liver function tests, as well as
PNPLA3 genotype (Supplementary Table 1). Within the
estimation
and
validation
cohorts
(Supplementary
Tables 2 and 3), the NASH group showed similar ab-
normalities compared with the non-NASH group, as was
observed in the entire group (Table 1).
Development of a Model to Predict
Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis
We first developed a model based on clinical pa-
rameters and the PNPLA3 genotype alone, then models

 based on MS-based profiling, and, finally, a model using
all data.
Model based on clinical parameters and I148M variant
in PNPLA3: nonalcoholic steatohepatitis clinical score. To
build the NASH Clin Score, we used variables differing
significantly between NASH and non-NASH groups in
univariate
analysis
in
the
estimation
group
(Supplementary Table 2). The model was developed using
multivariate logistic regression analysis based on clinical
variables and PNPLA3 genotype. The final model included
the same predictors as the NASH score, which was
developed recently in a group of 296 Finnish patients and
validated in a cohort of 380 Italian patients12 (ie, fasting
insulin level, AST level, and PNPLA3 genotype). The NASH
Clin Score was calculated as follows: -3.05 þ 0.562 �
PNPLA3 genotype (CC ¼ 1/GC ¼ 2/GG ¼ 3) - 0.0092 �
fasting serum (fS)-insulin level (mU/L) þ 0.0023 � AST
(IU/L) þ 0.0019 � (fS-insulin � AST).
The AUROC for the NASH Clin Score in the entire
group (n ¼ 318) was 0.778 (95% confidence interval
[CI], 0.709–0.846).
Lipidomics and metabolomics data. By using the 2
MS-based analytic platforms, a total of 597 molecular
lipids and metabolites were measured and 168 were
identified. Total fS-TG measured enzymatically was
correlated closely with the sum of plasma TGs identified
by UPLC-MS (r ¼ 0.92; P < .001).
Cluster analysis of lipidomics data. We analyzed the
global lipidome by clustering the data into a subset of
clusters using Bayesian model-based clustering. The
lipidomic platform data were decomposed into 8 lipid
clusters (LCs), which to a large extent adhered to
different lipid functional or structural group. Data on
each cluster and representative lipids are shown in
Table 2. In the NASH, compared with the non-NASH,
group, significant differences were found in 3 lipid
clusters (LC3, LC4, and LC6) (Supplementary Figure 1).
We found NASH to be associated significantly with
increased
concentrations
of
saturated
and
mono-
unsaturated TGs (LC4). In contrast, concentrations of
sphingomyelins
(LC3)
and
lysophosphatidylcholines
(lysoPC) (LC6) were significantly lower in the NASH

 than in the non-NASH group (Supplementary Figure 1,
Table 2).
Absolute and relative concentrations of triacylglycer-
ols. Absolute concentrations of circulating TGs between
the NASH and non-NASH groups are compared in a heat
map (Figure 1, left panel). In the NASH, as compared
with the non-NASH, groups, the absolute concentrations
of especially saturated and monounsaturated TGs such
as TG(46:0), TG(48:0), TG(50:0), TG(46:1), and TG(51:1)
were increased significantly.
The relative distribution of TGs (the concentration of
an individual TG divided by total TGs measured by UPLC-
MS) between the NASH and non-NASH groups is shown
in Figure 1 (right panel). The relative concentrations of
saturated and monounsaturated TGs were increased in
the NASH as compared with the non-NASH group
(Figure 1, right). Consistent with an increase in TGs
containing saturated and monounsaturated TGs, the
fold-changes (NASH/non-NASH) of absolute (r ¼ -0.75;
P < .0001) (Figure 2, left panel) and relative (r ¼ -0.75;
P < .0001) (Figure 2, right panel) concentrations of
TGs were correlated inversely with the number of double
bonds.
Lipidomics-based model. By using the lipidomics data
from the estimation cohort, we derived a logistic
regression model (see the Methods section for more
detail) for NASH. The final score based on lipidomics
data (NASH Lip Score) included 3 selected molecular
lipids, TG(48:0), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)(40:6),
and
LysoPC(16:0),
and
was
calculated
as
follows:
2.531 þ 2.334 � log10(TG[48:0]) (mmol/L) þ 1.555 �
log10(PE[40:6]) (mmol/L) - 4.081 � log10(LysoPC[16:0])
(mmol/L).
In the estimation group, the AUROC was 0.767 (95%
CI, 0.687–0.847). For the validation group (n ¼ 95), the
AUROC was 0.809 (95% CI, 0.714–0.905) and in the
entire data set (n ¼ 318) was 0.779 (95% CI, 0.717-
0.841). The negative predictive values, positive predic-
tive values, sensitivity, and specificity of the entire data
set are shown in Table 3.
Metabolomics-based model. We also derived a logistic
regression model for NASH using the metabolomics data
from the estimation cohort. The score based on metab-
olomics (NASH Met Score) included 5 selected molecular
metabolites: Glu, Ile, Tyr, glycine (Gly), and serine (Ser).
The NASH Met Score was calculated as follows: -10.701
þ 1.852 � log10(Glu) (mmol/L) þ 6.461 � log10(Ile)
(mmol/L) þ 3.556 � log10(Tyr) (mmol/L) - 3.908 �
log10(Gly) (mmol/L) - 2.822 � log10(Ser) (mmol/L).
The model had an AUROC of 0.729 (95% CI,
0.649–0.808) in the estimation cohort. In the validation
group (n ¼ 95), the AUROC was 0.710 (95% CI,
0.604–0.816). In the entire group, the AUROC was 0.719
(95% CI, 0.655–0.782) (Table 3).
Model based on all data. By applying backward step-
wise logistic regression analyses of the variables from all
of the aforementioned models, we developed the NASH
ClinLipMet Score (NASH score based on clinical vari-
ables, PNPLA3 genotype, lipidomics, and metabolomics
data, corrected for the number of variables included in
the model, which was calculated as follows: -8.167 þ
0.954 � PNPLA3 genotype (CC ¼ 1/GC ¼ 2/GG ¼ 3) þ
0.0451 � AST (IU/L) þ 0.0667 � fS-insulin (mU/L) -
3.151 � log10(LysoPC[16:0]) (mmol/L) þ 2.617 �
log10(PE[40:6]) (mmol/L) þ 2.357 � log10(Glu) (mmol/
L) þ 7.813 � log10(Ile) (mmol/L) – 6.102 � log10(Gly)
(mmol/L).
The AUROC was 0.882 (95% CI, 0.827–0.938) in the
estimation and 0.856 (95% CI, 0.774–0.938) in the
validation cohort. In the entire group, the AUROC was
0.866 (95% CI, 0.820–0.913). The sensitivity was 85.5%
and the specificity was 72.1% (Table 3).
Diagnostic Performances in the Subgroups
Because bariatric patients might differ from non-
bariatric patients, we excluded 54 patients not under-
going bariatric surgery and measured the performance of
all scores in the specific group with bariatric patients.
The AUROCs of the NASH Clin Score, NASH Lip Score, and
NASH Met Score in the bariatric surgery patients were as
follows: 0.774 (95% CI, 0.696–0.852), 0.789 (95% CI,
0.720–0.858),
and
0.738

Discussion
This study developed an MS-based model and score
for NASH and compared its diagnostic performance with
scores based on routinely available data and on PNPLA3
genotype at rs738409. We identified a set of lipids and
metabolites that significantly were associated with NASH
in a liver biopsy cohort of 318 subjects. We performed
Gibbs sampling and backward stepwise logistic regres-
sion to select variables that fulfilled Bayesian informa-
tion criterion. A model that included AST, the PNPLA3
genotype,
fasting
insulin,
LysoPC(16:0),
PE(40:6),
Glu, Ile, and Gly best predicted NASH (the NASH Clin-
LipMet Score). The AUROC of this score was 0.86, which
was significantly higher than that of the NASH Lip score,
NASH Met Score, NASH Clin Score,6 NASH Liver Fat
Score,6,9 and the NAFLD lipid triplet score.14 These data
show that MS-based profiling combined with clinical
variables may help in the development of a noninvasive
diagnosis of NASH.
The NASH group, compared with the non-NASH
group, had an absolute and relative excess of saturated
and monounsaturated TGs in their circulating lipidomics
profile (Figure 1). TGs containing saturated fatty acids
and monounsaturated fatty acid were shown previously
to be overproduced in a study involving 9 subjects by the
splanchnic area.15 De novo lipogenesis produces satu-
rated fatty acids exclusively.16 Stable isotope studies
tracing the origin of intrahepatocellular TGs suggest that
de novo lipogenesis is prominent and perhaps the only
abnormal pathway in patients with NAFLD.17 Hence,
circulating TGs containing saturated fatty acids and
monounsaturated fatty acids might reflect increased de
novo lipogenesis. Individual TGs did not, however,
remain significant independent predictors of NASH in the
final
model
including
both
clinical
and
MS-profi-
ling–based parameters (NASH ClinLipMet). This is most
likely because of multicolinearity, that is, saturated and
monounsaturated TGs were correlated closely with
features of IR such as fS insulin and thus more markers
of IR and steatosis than NASH.
Circulating LysoPC16:0 deficiency was associated
with NASH. This metabolite as well as other lysoPCs and
phosphatidylcholines (Supplementary Figure 2), which
also were deficient in NASH, are found mostly in the HDL
lipoprotein fraction, which was low in the NASH as
compared with other groups.18 LysoPC16:0 recently was
found
to
be
the
most
deficient
metabolite
when
comparing 180 metabolites between 20 insulin-resistant
and 20 insulin-sensitive morbidly obese subjects with
NAFLD.19 In 14 subjects who underwent a liver biopsy,
lysoPC16:0 levels were higher in insulin-resistant sub-
jects with a trend toward higher inflammation in their
liver.19
Low
lysoPC16:0
concentrations
also
were
observed in preadipocyte cultures from 10 metabolically
unhealthy as compared with 10 metabolically healthy
obese subjects.20
The metabolite data are consistent with data reported
in several small studies. Branch chain amino acids
(BCAA) and essential amino acids are increased in
obese/insulin-resistant subjects.21 BCAA also promote IR
induced by high-fat feeding. Increases in BCAA are
accompanied by increases in C3 and C5 acylcarnitines,
which are BCAA metabolites in the liver and in skeletal
muscle.22 The increase in the BCAA Ile, and in Glu, which
is the first step of BCAA catabolism, therefore could be
attributed to obesity/IR, which is associated with NASH.
Increases in Glu previously have been found in studies
that included 243 and 1623 patients with NASH. Very
recently, a genome-scale metabolomics model was con-
structed to interpret liver transcriptome data in NASH
patients. Altered Glu metabolism was predicted to be the
single most abnormal site of metabolism in NASH.24 The
second most common abnormality was predicted to be
Ser deficiency, which is known to characterize patients
with NASH and insulin-resistant as compared with
insulin-sensitive subjects.3,25 Consistently, Ser deficiency
also characterized the patients with NASH in the present
study. Gly is formed from Ser in a reaction catalyzed by
SHMT1, an enzyme leading to Ser formation that was
predicted to be down-regulated in NASH.24 Thus, the
observed changes in amino acid concentrations in the
NASH group compared with the non-NASH group reflect
previously described pathophysiologic changes in human
beings and in experimental animals.
Use of the predictive equation developed in this study
requires set-up of an assay specifically measuring each
component. This is feasible given that an increasing
number of analytic methods in clinical chemistry labo-
ratories use targeted MS-based methods.26 Once estab-
lished and automated, such a method requires a minute
amount of plasma and is less time consuming and
cumbersome for clinicians than assessment of the
different components, especially scores that necessitate
inclusion of parameters from physical examination such
as
waist
circumference.27
Regarding
the
cost
and
reproducibility of the “omics” technology, it is important
to establish whether screening using the NASH ClinLip-
Met Score is cost effective. This cannot be performed
based on the present study, which is a first step and
shows that it is possible to improve the diagnostic ac-
curacy of a predictive score for NASH using MS-based
analytic platforms in morbidly obese patients with a
high prevalence of NASH.
Limitations of the present study should be considered
when interpreting the results. The score was derived
from a cohort including a large number of obese patients,
which may hamper its application to the general popu-
lation. Although the histologic criteria for NASH are
1470 Zhou et al
Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology Vol. 14, No. 10
 similar irrespective of obesity, it is important to validate
the NASH ClinLipMet Score in a cohort that is not
morbidly obese. Treatment with lipid-lowering drugs
may influence their plasma lipid levels and act as a po-
tential confounder. However, the performance of the
NASH Clin Score, NASH Lip Score, NASH Met Score, and
the NASH ClinLipMet Score was not influenced by use of
lipid-lowering medications, which thus suggest that the
scores are robust and that use of lipid-lowering medi-
cations does not limit the usefulness of these scores. The
study was cross-sectional and thus the term predictor
merely denotes a factor that is associated with the risk of
NASH. Scores ideally should be validated in a longitudi-
nal study, but such a study is challenging because it is
ethically unacceptable to obtain repeated liver biopsy
specimens from individuals with no indication for such a
procedure. Although the NASH ClinLipMet Score had the
highest AUROC of 0.86 in diagnosing NASH among the
formulae tested with sensitivities and specificities of
80.6% and 75.3%, respectively, the diagnosis of NASH
will be missed in 19.4% of those with NASH and 24.7%
will be diagnosed incorrectly as having the disease. The
score developed in Finnish and Belgian Caucasian sub-
jects may not be valid in other ethnic groups.
In conclusion, use of MS-based methods helps in
improving a noninvasive diagnosis of NASH compared
with scores relying on routinely available clinical data
and PNPLA3 genotype at rs738409. In the present study,
the findings of increases of the saturated TG 48:0, Glu,
Ile, and decreases in lysoPC 16:0, Ser, and Gly in a rela-
tively large cohort of patients with NASH are consistent
with the known pathophysiology of NASH.

Lipidomic Analysis by Ultra-Performance
Liquid Chromatography–Quadruple
Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry
An aliquot (10 mL) of the plasma sample was diluted
with 10 mL of 0.15 mol/L (0.9%) sodium chloride, and 10
mL of internal standard mixture 1A was added. This
mixture contained phosphatidylcholine (17:0/0:0) and
(17:0/17:0),
PE(17:0/17:0),
phosphatidylglycerol
(17:0/17:0),
Cer(d18:1/17:0),
PS(17:0/17:0),
and
PA(17:0/17:0) (Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc, Alabaster, AL),
as
well
as
monoacylglycerol
(17:0/0:0/0:0),
diac-
ylglycerol
(17:0/17:0/0:0),
and
TG(17:0/17:0/17:0).
The lipids were extracted using a mixture of high-
performance liquid chromatography–grade chloroform
and methanol (2:1; 100 mL). The lower phase (60 mL)
was collected and 10 mL of an internal standard mixture
containing labeled phosphatidylcholine (16:1/0:0-D3),
phosphatidylcholine (16:1/16:1-D6), and TG(16:0/16:0/
16:0-13C3) was added.
The extracts were analyzed on a Waters Q-Tof Pre-
mier mass spectrometer combined with an Acquity Ultra
Performance LC. The column (at 50�C) was an Acquity
UPLC BEH C18 2.1 � 100 mm with 1.7-mm particles. The
solvent system included (A) ultrapure water including
1% 1 mol/L NH4Ac and 0.1% HCOOH) and (B) LC/MS-
grade
acetonitrile/isopropanol
(1:1,
1%
1
mol/L
NH4Ac, 0.1% HCOOH). The gradient started from 65% A/
35% B, reached 80% B in 2 minutes, 100% B in 7 mi-
nutes, and remained there for 7 minutes. The flow rate
was 0.400 mL/min and the injected amount was 2.0 mL
(Acquity Sample Organizer, at 10�C). Reserpine was used
as the lock spray reference compound. The lipid profiling
was performed using the electrospray ionization mode
and the data were collected at a mass range of m/z 300
to 1200 with a scan duration of 0.2 seconds.
The data processing included alignment of peaks,
peak integration, normalization, and identification. Lipids
were identified using an internal spectral library. The
data were normalized using 1 or more internal standards
representative of each class of lipid present in the
samples: the intensity of each identified lipid was
normalized by dividing it with the intensity of its cor-
responding standard and multiplying it by the concen-
tration of the standard. All monoacyl lipids except
cholesterol
esters,
such
as
monoacylglycerols
and
monoacylglycerophospholipids, were normalized with
phosphatidylcholine (17:0/0:0), all diacyl lipids except
ethanolamine
phospholipids
were
normalized
with
phosphatidylcholine (17:0/17:0), all ceramides with
Cer(d18:1/17:0), all diacyl ethanolamine phospholipids
with PE(17:0/17:0), and TG and cholesterol esters with
TG(17:0/17:0/17:0).
Other
(unidentified)
molecular
species
were
normalized
with
phosphatidylcholine
(17:0/0:0) for retention times shorter than 300 seconds,
phosphatidylcholine (17:0/17:0) for a retention time
between 300 and 410 seconds, and TG(17:0/17:0/17:0)
for longer retention times.
Quality control of the method showed that the day-to-
day repeatability of control serum samples, and the
relative standard deviation for values identified was on
average less than 25% and 20% for the discovery and
validation sets, respectively. The internal standards
added to all samples in the study had an average relative
standard deviation of 25% and 13% in the discovery and
validation sets, respectively.
For further identification of unknown lipids, fractions
collected from the UPLC run were infused to a LTQ-
Orbitrap (Thermo Fischer Scientific, San Jose, CA) mass
spectrometer by a TriVersa Nanomate (Advion Bio-
sciences, Ithaca, NY) using chip-based nanoelectrospray
in positive and negative ionization mode. Identifications
were based on the exact mass and MSn spectra. The in-
strument was calibrated externally according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. MS2 and MS3 were acquired
using either low resolution or high resolution up to
target mass resolution of R ¼ 60 000 at m/z 400. The
normalized collision energies of 30% to 40% were
applied in MSn experiments.
Metabolomic Analysis
Polar metabolites were analyzed using comprehen-
sive 2-dimensional gas chromatography combined with
time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC � GC - TOFMS).1
A total of 400 mL methanol and 10 mL internal stan-
dard mixture (C17:0 [93.3 mg/L], valine-d [18.5 mg/L],
and succinic acid-d4 [31.5 mg/L]) were added to 30 mL
of plasma samples. The samples were vortex mixed
(2 minutes at 20 Hz). After 30 minutes at room tem-
perature the samples were centrifuged for 5 minutes at
10,000 rpm. The supernatant was moved to a GC vial and
evaporated to dryness under nitrogen. The samples
were trimethylsilylated with 25 mL Methoxyamine (45�C,
60
min)
and
25
mL
N-Methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)tri-
fluoroacetamide (45�C, 60 min), and 5 mL of retention
index solution in hexane was added to samples (150 mg/
L C11, C15, C17, C21, and C25 alkanes).
For
metabolomics
analysis,
a
Leco
Pegasus
4D
GC�GC-TOFMS instrument (Leco Corp, St. Joseph, MI)
equipped with a cryogenic modulator was used. The GC
part of the instrument was an Agilent 6890 gas chro-
matograph (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA), equip-
ped with a split/splitless injector. The first-dimension
chromatographic column was a 10-m RTX-5 capillary
column with an internal diameter of 0.18 mm and a
stationary phase film thickness of 0.20 mm, and the
second-dimension chromatographic column was a 1.5 m
BPX-50 capillary column with an internal diameter of
100 mm and a film thickness of 0.1 mm. A methyl deac-
tivated retention gap (3 m � 0.53 mm i.d.) was used in
the front of the first column. High-purity helium was

 used as the carrier gas at a constant pressure mode
(39.6 pounds per square inch gauge). A 5-second sepa-
ration time was used in the second dimension. The MS
spectra were measured at 45 to 700 atomic mass unit
with 100 spectra/second. For the injection, a pulsed
splitless injection (0.5 mL) at 240�C was used, with a
pulse pressure of 55 psig for 1 minute. The temperature
program was as follows: the first-dimension column
oven ramp began at 40�C with a 2-minute hold, after
which the temperature was programmed to 295�C at a
rate of 7�C/min, and then held at this temperature for 3
minutes. The second-dimension column temperature
was maintained at 20�C higher than the corresponding
first-dimension column. The programming rate and hold
times were the same for the 2 columns.
ChromaTOF vendor software (Leco) was used for
within-sample data processing, including quantitation of
selected target metabolites, and Guineu software (Espoo,
Finland) was used for alignment, normalization, and
peak matching across samples.1 The peaks were first
filtered based on the number of detected peaks in the
total profile of all sample runs. The normalization was
performed by correction for internal standards. Other
mass spectra from the GC � GC - TOFMS analysis were
searched against The Palisade Complete Mass Spectral
Library, 600K Edition (Palisade Mass Spectrometry,
Ithaca, NY). Data were processed using the Guineu
software.
After nontargeted profiling of the discovery set, 13
metabolites were selected for quantitative analysis
(amino acids, free fatty acids), which then were quanti-
fied in both validation and discovery sets using external
calibration curves, after normalization with the labeled
group-specific internal standards. Quality control of the
method showed that the day-to-day repeatability of
control serum samples, and the relative standard devia-
tion for values identified was on average less than 22%
and 19% for the discovery and validation sets, respec-
tively. The internal standards added to all the samples in
the study had an average relative standard deviation of
20% and 18% in the discovery and validation sets,
respectively.

of
abundances
of
triacylglycerol
spe-
cies. Mean and standard errors of abundances of plasma
TG molecular species were calculated. After log2 trans-
formation, the average abundances of TG molecules were
compared between the NASH and non-NASH groups by
Student t tests. Multiple comparisons were corrected by
using the Benjamini–Hochberg method.2 The compari-
sons were illustrated by heat maps, which plot chain
lengths of fatty acid against the number of double bonds
for each TG. R Package, metadar (http://code.google.
com/p/metadar) was used for data analysis.

The y-axes represent the names of lipids, and
the x-axes show the groups for comparison
(NAFL vs non-NAFLD, NASH vs NAFL, and
NASH vs non-NAFLD). The Tukey honestly
significant differences post hoc test was used
to compare 2 groups after 1-way analysis of
variance. Blue represents a decrease and red
shows an increase between groups. The
brighter the red color, the greater the increase
of absolute concentration of the individual
lipid between groups. The brighter the blue
color, the greater the decrease. The signifi-
cances for the comparisons are marked as
follows: *P < .05, **P < .005, and ***P < .0005.
