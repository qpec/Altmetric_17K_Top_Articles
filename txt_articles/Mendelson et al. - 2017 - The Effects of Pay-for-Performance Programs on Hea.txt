Background: The benefits of pay-for-performance (P4P) pro-
grams are uncertain.
Purpose: To update and expand a prior review examining the
effects of P4P programs targeted at the physician, group, mana-
gerial, or institutional level on process-of-care and patient out-
comes in ambulatory and inpatient settings.
Data Sources: PubMed from June 2007 to October 2016;
MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Business Economics and Theory,
Business Source Elite, Scopus, Faculty of 1000, and Gartner Re-
search from June 2007 to February 2016.
Study Selection: Trials and observational studies in ambulatory
and inpatient settings reporting process-of-care, health, or utili-
zation outcomes.
Data Extraction: Two investigators extracted data, assessed
study quality, and graded the strength of the evidence.
Data Synthesis: Among 69 studies, 58 were in ambulatory set-
tings, 52 reported process-of-care outcomes, and 38 reported
patient outcomes. Low-strength evidence suggested that P4P
programs in ambulatory settings may improve process-of-care
outcomes over the short term (2 to 3 years), whereas data on
longer-term effects were limited. Many of the positive studies
were conducted in the United Kingdom, where incentives were
larger than in the United States. The largest improvements were
seen in areas where baseline performance was poor. There was
no consistent effect of P4P on intermediate health outcomes
(low-strength evidence) and insufficient evidence to characterize
any effect on patient health outcomes. In the hospital setting,
there was low-strength evidence that P4P had little or no effect
on patient health outcomes and a positive effect on reducing
hospital readmissions.
Limitation: Few methodologically rigorous studies; heteroge-
neous population and program characteristics and incentive
targets.
Conclusion: Pay-for-performance programs may be associated
with improved processes of care in ambulatory settings, but con-
sistently positive associations with improved health outcomes
have not been demonstrated in any setting.

P
ay-for-performance (P4P) programs provide finan-
cial rewards or penalties to individual health care
providers, groups of providers, or institutions accord-
ing to their performance on measures of quality. In the-
ory, if properly targeted and designed, P4P programs
would help drive the behavior of providers and health
care systems to improve the quality of care delivered,
reduce unnecessary use of expensive health care ser-
vices, and improve patient health outcomes (1). The
idea is particularly relevant in the United States,
where serious and broad gaps in health care quality
have been tied in part to the long-standing fee-for-
service system, which may provide incentives for ser-
vice volume rather than quality (2).
Despite their intuitive appeal, the promise of P4P
programs in improving outcomes has not been empir-
ically realized in past studies (3–6). The most recent
systematic review examining the effectiveness of P4P
programs in the United States found mixed evidence
that P4P was associated with modest improvements in
process-of-care outcomes but had little effect on pa-
tient outcomes (7). However, the literature has grown
considerably since this review (which searched through
2012), and other countries, such as the United King-
dom, have gained considerable experience with large
P4P initiatives that may provide information relevant to
the United States. The purpose of the current review is
to update and expand the prior systematic review in
order to summarize current understanding of the ef-
fects of P4P programs targeted at physicians, groups,
and institutions on process-of-care and patient out-
comes in ambulatory and outpatient settings in and
outside the United States.
METHODS
This review was conducted according to a protocol
that was developed using established reporting stan-
dards and posted to a public Web site (8) before the
study was initiated (Appendix 1 of the Supplement,
available at Annals.org). We used an analytic frame-
work based on work by Damberg and colleagues (7)
(Appendix 2 of the Supplement).
Data Sources and Searches
We searched the following databases for studies
that evaluated P4P programs: PubMed (1 June 2007 to

ness Economics and Theory, Business Source Elite, Sco-
pus, Faculty of 1000, and Gartner Research (1 June
2007 to 29 February 2016). We also performed tar-
geted Google and PubMed searches aimed at well-
known P4P demonstrations. We obtained additional
articles from reference lists of pertinent studies, re-
views, editorials, and expert recommendations. The
search strategies are detailed in Appendix 3 of the
Supplement.
Study Selection
Investigators reviewed titles and abstracts identi-
fied from literature searches. Two investigators inde-
pendently assessed each potentially relevant article for
inclusion using preestablished criteria (Appendices 4
and 5 of the Supplement). We included English-
language studies of adult patients that evaluated am-
bulatory care– or hospital-based P4P programs target-
ing health care providers at the individual, group,
managerial, or institutional level and that reported any
process-of-care,
utilization,
health,
or
intermediate
health (clinical measures, such as a laboratory value or
blood pressure) outcome. We included studies from
other countries that have health systems similar to por-
tions of the U.S. health care system. Studies examining
only patient-targeted financial incentives, as well as
payment models other than direct P4P, such as man-
aged care, capitation, bundled payments, and account-
able care organizations, were excluded. We also ex-
cluded studies that were not conducted in hospital or
ambulatory settings, such as studies in long-term care
facilities or nursing homes.
We included clinical or cluster randomized, con-
trolled trials (RCTs) of any size. We used a best-
evidence approach, which is a method of specifying
minimum inclusion criteria for nonrandomized studies
(9). Inclusion of observational studies was limited to
those with a comparison group, interrupted time series
(ITS) studies, or large (n > 10 000) cross-sectional or un-
controlled before–after studies. We excluded smaller
uncontrolled studies because we had identified a large
number of potentially relevant studies during a prelim-
inary search and because the smaller uncontrolled
studies were less likely to provide broadly applicable
information given their limited scope and inherent
methodological deficiencies.
Data Extraction and Quality Assessment
One investigator abstracted data elements from
each included study, which were reviewed for accuracy
by at least 1 additional investigator. We abstracted in-
formation on study design, sample size, country, pro-
gram description, incentive structure (size and timing),
target of the incentive, comparator, and outcomes
(grouped as health, intermediate health, process-of-
care, and utilization measures). Appendices 6 and 7 of
the Supplement report these data. We classified stud-
ies according to 4 broad groupings: RCTs, ITS studies,
controlled
before–after
studies,
and
uncontrolled
before–after studies. Two investigators independently
assessed study quality using the Newcastle-Ottawa
Scale (10) for observational studies and the Cochrane
Risk-of-Bias tool (11) for RCTs (Appendix 8 of the Sup-
plement). Disagreements were resolved by consensus.
Data Synthesis and Analysis
We qualitatively synthesized the results of ambula-
tory
and
hospital
studies
separately
and
report
process-of-care and patient outcomes for each setting.
We synthesized results for specific P4P programs when-
ever possible. The review team evaluated the strength
of the evidence according to guidance from the
Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (12). We
did not perform meta-analysis because of the marked
clinical heterogeneity across studies and the large
number of observational studies.
Role of the Funding Source
The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Quality En-
hancement Research Initiative supported this review
but had no role in the design and conduct of the study;
collection, management, analysis, and interpretation of
the data; preparation, review, or approval of the
manuscript; or decision to submit the manuscript for
publication.

 ambulatory settings (Table 1 and Appendix 6 of the
Supplement), 11 were in hospital settings (Table 2 and
Appendix 7 of the Supplement), 52 reported process-
of-care outcomes, and 38 assessed patient outcomes.
The studies examined a wide range of P4P programs
with varying incentive structures, goals, and contexts.
The programs also differed in their purposes and tar-
gets, but the largest number of studies focused on
managing chronic conditions in the primary care set-
ting. Studies were conducted in a wide range of coun-
tries, including the United Kingdom (27 studies), the
United States (17 studies), Taiwan (13 studies), France
(3 studies), the Netherlands (3 studies), Canada (3 stud-
ies), Australia (1 study), South Korea (1 study), and Italy
(1 study). There were 2 RCTs and 67 observational
studies (10 ITS studies, 37 controlled before–after stud-
ies, and 20 large uncontrolled before–after studies).
A large number of studies evaluated different as-
pects of 2 large-scale national programs: the United
Kingdom'
s Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF)
(24 studies) and Taiwan'
s diabetes mellitus (DM-P4P)
program (9 studies). The QOF is a nationwide program
that began in 2004. It incentivizes primary care prac-
tices to achieve quality indicators that support clinical
care and public health goals. Incentive payments can
comprise up to approximately 30% of total income.
Practices are aided by integrated health information
technology that delivers automated prompts and deci-
sion support (36, 83). Taiwan'
s DM-P4P program, im-
plemented in 2001, allows physicians to voluntarily en-
roll in the program, and they in turn are given freedom
to choose which patients to enroll (51). From 2001 to
2006, incentives targeted process-of-care outcomes,
which were augmented with intermediate health out-
come measures after 2006.
Ambulatory Care–Based Programs
Process-of-Care Outcomes
We found 9 studies from the United States evaluat-
ing the effects of P4P on process-of-care outcomes (14,
16–20, 22–24). Most of these studies examined out-
comes over 4 years and had an average follow-up of
2.5 years; very few studies reported longer-term data.
One RCT found that individual incentives increased ap-
propriate response to high blood pressure but not use
of guideline-recommended antihypertensive medica-
tion (14). Of the 6 studies that reported positive results
(16, 18, 19, 22–24), 1 did not have a control group (24),
and selection bias was a serious concern in 3 others
because of the way the control group was chosen (18,
22,
23).
Two
methodologically
sound
controlled
before–after studies found no improvements in pro-
cesses of care (17, 20).
In general, there was evidence across 17 studies in
the United Kingdom (26–31, 33, 36–38, 41–47) that the
QOF was associated with improvements in process-of-
care measures, although the evidence was mixed
among the more methodologically rigorous studies.
There were 6 ITS studies. One showed substantial im-
provements in the prescription of long-acting revers-
ible contraceptives (26), and another showed modest
improvement in the initiation of diabetes medications
(27). Another study found increased rates of depres-
sion screening and diagnoses, but antidepressant pre-
scribing remained unchanged (31). In the other 3 stud-
ies,
improvements
had

well
before
QOF
implementation, and postintervention trends did not
show substantial improvement and, in fact, showed
slower or decreased improvement over time (28–30).
Although many studies of Taiwan'
s DM-P4P pro-
gram showed improvement in process-of-care mea-
sures, selection bias was a major concern (51–54, 58).
Physicians voluntarily enrolled and were given discre-
tion over which patients to enroll. Because the program
lacked risk adjustment and, initially, a mechanism to
disenroll patients, physicians had a strong incentive to
enroll healthier patients (51). Indeed, enrolled patients
were much healthier than nonenrolled patients. More-
over, at participating institutions, the pool of nonen-
rolled patients became sicker over time, indicating that
healthier patients were being removed to participate in
DM-P4P. Though many studies attempted to adjust for
differences in the 2 groups by using propensity score
matching, residual confounding was still an important
potential issue given the many unmeasured factors that
were likely to be related to enrollment decision making.
We found 13 non-U.S. studies that were not part of
a larger P4P evaluation. Two of these studies were
methodologically sound observational studies from
Canada that reported contradictory results on screen-
ing and preventive measures (66, 67). An ITS study
found modest increases in colorectal cancer screening
but no effects on cervical and breast cancer screening
(66). However, a controlled before–after study found
modest increases for colorectal cancer screening,
mammography, flu shots, and Papanicolaou smears
(67). It was difficult to draw strong conclusions from the
other 11 studies because of disparities in the programs'
targets and designs and the study settings, as well as
the low quality of the study designs (49, 50, 61–65,
68–71).
Patient Outcomes
Health Outcomes.
Ten studies evaluated health
outcomes in ambulatory settings (39, 44, 51, 52, 55–57,
59–61). Eight of the studies (most of which found pos-
itive results) were conducted in Taiwan and should be
interpreted with caution due to selection bias, as de-
scribed earlier (51, 52, 55–57, 59–61). Two large un-
controlled before–after studies of QOF reported no im-
provements in health outcomes (39, 44). One assessed
the correlation among regional QOF performance, all-
cause mortality, and condition-specific mortality (39). It
found that better performance on both the aggregate
of QOF quality indicators and a subset of intermediate
outcome indicators did not correlate with reduced
mortality. Another study found that chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD) prevalence actually in-
creased from 1.27% to 1.45% after QOF implementa-
tion (44). Given the time needed to develop COPD and

 that most QOF indicators focused on managing COPD
rather than preventing it, the implications of these find-
ings are unclear.
Studies with high risk of bias generally found posi-
tive effects associated with DM-P4P (51, 52, 55–57, 59)
and the similarly structured tuberculosis P4P program
(60, 61). However, given the limitations already high-
lighted, such results are difficult to interpret.
Utilization Outcomes. We found 6 studies from the
United States (16, 17, 20–22, 24), 5 studies from Taiwan
(52–54, 58, 60), and 1 QOF study (34) reporting utiliza-
tion outcomes.
The 6 studies from the United States reported
mixed findings on the effects of P4P on utilization, al-
though studies with the strongest designs showed no
effect. One rigorously controlled study examined a P4P
intervention that provided bonuses to practices that
achieved advanced medical home status and found no
effect on all-cause hospitalizations, all-cause emer-
gency department (ED) visits, or ambulatory care–
sensitive ED visits (17). Ambulatory care–sensitive hos-
pitalizations actually increased in the second year of the
intervention. Another controlled before–after study ex-
amined P4P in 3 state Medicaid programs and found
no changes in any of the states for ED visits and incon-
sistent findings on inpatient utilization (20). A study ex-
amining a P4P program in medical homes targeting im-
proved diabetes screenings and care found reductions
in ED use and primary care visits but not in 6 other
utilization measures (21). One study of a Medicare Ad-
vantage plan that rewarded physicians for providing
evidence-based care to patients with heart failure
found no effect on acute admissions or ED visits (16).
Two
studies
lacking
appropriate
control
groups
showed improvement in ED use (22, 24).
Studies in Taiwan generally found reductions in
hospital use associated with P4P (52–54, 58, 60). Again,
due to the high likelihood of selection bias, these stud-
ies should be interpreted with caution.
A QOF study found a sustained reduction in ambu-
latory care–sensitive ED admissions (34).
Intermediate Health Outcomes. Twelve studies re-
ported 1 or more intermediate health outcomes (13,
14, 25, 32, 35, 37, 38, 40, 41, 43, 47, 48). There were 2
RCTs with low risk of bias conducted in the United
States. One RCT (n = 1503) evaluated the effect of a
P4P program on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol
levels (13). Physicians were given monthly patient prog-
ress reports and were eligible for comparatively large
P4P bonuses ($256 quarterly per patient) that were
separated from other funding sources to highlight their
relevance. Physicians received average total incentive
payments of $3246. The difference in low-density lipo-
protein cholesterol level between patients seen by phy-
sicians in the P4P and control groups was not signifi-
cant (2.8 mg/dL [95% CI, �1.7 to 7.4 mg/dL]; P = 0.66).
The other RCT (14) was included in the prior review
by Damberg and colleagues, but a substudy was re-
cently published (15). The original trial compared the
effect of financial incentives earned for controlled
blood pressure or response to uncontrolled blood
pressure across 4 groups: incentives directed to indi-
vidual physicians, practices, or both, or no incentives
(14). The study included 77 physicians; payments and
performance feedback were delivered to physicians at
the end of each 4-month performance period. The av-
erage total payment for physicians completing the en-
tire program was $2744. A higher proportion of pa-
tients achieved one or both measures in the individual
physician incentive group than the control group (dif-
ference, 8.36% [CI, 2.4% to 13.0%]; P = 0.005), al-
though the differences were not significant in the other
2 intervention groups. The recently published substudy
found that the proportion of patients achieving control
was not significantly higher in the incentive group
(15).
Ten observational studies examining QOF re-
ported mixed findings on intermediate outcomes (25,
32, 35, 37, 38, 40, 41, 43, 47, 48), but methodologically
stronger studies suggested that QOF had little effect.
Uncontrolled studies suggested large improvements in
blood pressure control, cholesterol levels, and hemo-
globin A1c (HbA1c) control. However, higher-quality
studies that accounted for time trends failed to repli-
cate these findings (25, 32). One short-term ITS study
found that blood pressure control and cholesterol lev-
els improved but HbA1c control worsened relative to
the underlying trend (32). A longer-term ITS study
found that although mean cholesterol and HbA1c levels
and blood pressure control had been improving before
QOF implementation, only systolic blood pressure con-
tinued to improve afterward. Diastolic blood pressure,
mean cholesterol levels, and HbA1c levels actually
worsened relative to the pre-QOF trend (25).
Hospital-Based Programs
Process-of-Care Outcomes
Eight studies examined process-of-care measures
in the hospital setting (74–77, 79–82). Controlled
before–after studies from the United States and Canada
generally failed to find improvements in care processes
(74, 75), although 1 study from Canada did report mod-
est reductions in ED wait times (80). One controlled
study from Taiwan found that P4P-enrolled patients
with breast cancer received better-quality care than
nonenrolled patients (79). Uncontrolled studies re-
ported larger improvements (76, 77, 81, 82).
Patient Outcomes
Health Outcomes. Pay-for-performance programs
generally did not decrease mortality or improve patient
experience in 5 studies in hospital settings (73, 74, 78,
79, 82). High-quality studies examining the U.K. Hospi-
tal Quality Incentive demonstration and the U.S. Hospi-
tal Value-Based Purchasing (HVBP) programs did not
find a link between mortality and targeted conditions
(73, 78). One short-term controlled before–after study
found no immediate change in patient experience as-
sociated with the HVBP program (74). One uncon-
trolled study found that mortality related to hemor-
rhagic strokes did not decrease after implementation of
P4P (82). A study from Taiwan indicated that P4P pa-
tients had improved breast cancer survival (79).
Utilization Outcomes.
One ITS study reported
utilization outcomes (72) and found that hospital

 readmissions among Medicare fee-for-service patients
decreased sharply for approximately 2 years after
implementation of the Hospital Readmissions Reduc-
tion Program; improvements continued thereafter but
at a substantially lower rate. Although readmission re-
ductions were seen for various conditions, they de-
creased more among the measures that were specifi-
cally targeted by the program than those that were
not.
DISCUSSION
This systematic review of 69 studies updated and
expanded on a previous review that had focused on
U.S. programs and reported similar findings (7). The
strength of the evidence and key results are summa-
rized in Table 3. Overall, in the ambulatory setting, we
found low-strength evidence that P4P programs may
improve process-of-care outcomes over the short term

 (2 to 3 years). Evidence on the longer-term effects of
P4P programs was limited. Many of the studies report-
ing positive findings were conducted in the United
Kingdom, where incentives were much larger than any
P4P programs in the United States. The largest im-
provements were seen in areas where baseline perfor-
mance was poor. We found low-strength evidence that
P4P had little to no effect on intermediate health out-
comes (changes in laboratory measures), though there
were inconsistencies among study results. The evi-
dence examining patient health outcomes was insuffi-
cient because few methodologically rigorous studies
reported these outcomes. In the hospital setting, low-
strength evidence showed that P4P had a neutral effect
on patient health outcomes and a positive effect on
reducing hospital readmissions.
Although many studies found positive effects asso-
ciated with P4P programs, the results were inconsistent
across studies, the magnitude of effect was often small,
and it was difficult to confidently ascribe observed
changes in outcomes to the intervention itself because
of the observational nature of most studies and their
specific methodological flaws. To better characterize
the breadth of programs that have been evaluated, we
included large uncontrolled studies reporting out-
comes before and after program implementation. How-
ever, in all of these studies, the 2 measurements poten-
tially reflect the peak and average of normally expected
measurement variation (a phenomenon known as re-
gression to the mean). The controlled before–after
studies do not have this same issue, but the choice of
control group was problematic in many studies be-
cause either the patients who qualified for a P4P pro-
gram differed systematically from those who did not, or
the participating providers or practices differed sub-
stantially from those that did not participate. The ITS
studies were useful because they accounted for trends
in outcomes before the intervention. Indeed, several of
these studies showed that improvements in outcomes
had begun before P4P implementation. It is unclear
whether these reflected secular trends in health care
or practice changes in anticipation of intervention
implementation.
Our findings complement and add to prior reviews,
which have also generally found that P4P programs
have not been consistently effective in improving pa-
tient outcomes (3–7). There are several reasons why this
might be the case. First, especially in the era of modern
health reform, P4P programs have been implemented
and assessed in settings where other effective quality
improvement interventions—such as public reporting,
audit and feedback, and electronic decision-support
tools—may have been deployed (84). The incremental
benefit of P4P may therefore have been more difficult
to demonstrate.
Second, it is possible that P4P programs have not
tested the “best” incentive structures and payment
mechanisms. Experts have suggested the importance
of designing P4P programs using the principles of be-
havioral economics, in which such factors as payment
size, timing, and frequency are believed to have impor-
tant influences on individual behavior (85). In health
care, we have not found strong empirical data to help
determine the most successful incentive structure (86).
It is interesting to consider the United Kingdom'
s QOF
program, which accounted for nearly 40% of the in-
cluded studies in our review, alongside U.S. efforts.
Studies of QOF found that incentivized process-of-care

 measures can lead to improvements, especially in the
early years of program implementation, but the rate of
improvement slowed over time and there was no clear
evidence
that
QOF
improved
patient
outcomes.
Whereas the P4P programs in the United States tended
to be implemented within health systems or payers and
involve relatively small incentives, QOF is the largest
P4P program ever attempted in health care. It was im-
plemented nationally with a single payer that includes
virtually all general practitioners and provides practices
with up to 30% of their annual income.
Finally, P4P programs are very complex health sys-
tem interventions that have been implemented in vari-
ous ways. In a related article, we examined the imple-
mentation factors that might mediate the potentially
beneficial and harmful effects of P4P programs (86). We
systematically reviewed studies of implementation fac-
tors and also conducted interviews with experts in the
field of P4P. Although direct evidence was inadequate
to draw strong conclusions, we found that provider
buy-in and alignment of measures with organizational
goals were likely to be important in sustaining effective
programs. We found that measures that were transpar-
ently developed from the evidence base and that were
focused on improving clinical processes and patient
outcomes rather than measures of efficiency were more
likely to be effective. We also found that the overall
number of incentives in place at any one time needs to
be carefully considered. Given the evidence that the
most substantial gains were consistently seen in areas
of poor baseline performance, we suggested that orga-
nizations use incentives in the most-needed areas, re-
view measures regularly, and discontinue them after
achieving sustained improvements.
Our review has several important limitations. The
evidence is limited by methodological flaws, variation
in program and population characteristics, and limited
reporting on secular trends in health care. We chose to
include studies from other countries because the
breadth of experience with P4P might be informative
for some U.S. health systems, but we acknowledge that
there are also limitations in applying findings from
other countries broadly in the United States. Our review
expands on a prior review, so it is possible we did not
include some individual studies that are informative,
though these probably would not have altered our
summary findings.
The policy implications of our findings are open to
interpretation. In the absence of strong evidence of
benefit, it may be particularly important to consider the
potential harms and costs associated with P4P. We re-
cently published a systematic review of the unintended
consequences of P4P: There was very limited evidence
assessing the extent of gaming, no consistent evidence
of a negative effect on health disparities, and a small
amount of evidence suggesting the potential for both
positive and negative effects on unincentivized mea-
sures (87). The costs and burden of documentation and
reporting requirements associated with P4P programs
are also important to consider but have not been stud-
ied extensively. Qualitative studies have found that
providers perceive P4P programs as imposing a con-
siderable burden and threatening clinical autonomy
(88–90). A recent survey study found that U.S. health
care providers self-report spending about 15 hours per
week reporting and interpreting data for measures,
which translates into billions of dollars in opportunity
cost (91). Indeed, the United Kingdom decided to scale
back its QOF program after 10 years of experience, in
part because of provider concerns and the inconsis-
tency of data demonstrating long-term benefit (92).
On the other hand, P4P programs have likely been
effective in some areas, most notably in improving pro-
cesses of care. The lack of evidence on patient out-
comes may reflect deficiencies in the methods that
have been used to study these effects and the likeli-
hood that it takes a long time for process-of-care im-
provements to translate into large-scale patient out-
come improvements (93).
In summary, we found low-strength, contradictory
evidence that P4P programs could improve processes
of care, but we found no clear evidence to suggest that
they improve patient outcomes. Value-based purchas-
ing is a cornerstone of the coming Medicare reform
known as the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthoriza-
tion Act, so P4P will remain a fixture in U.S. health care
for the foreseeable future (94). Whether the inconsis-
tency of positive findings suggests that P4P, broadly
speaking, is unlikely to have large effects or is related
to the marked differences in program design, patient
population, and incentive target is unclear.
