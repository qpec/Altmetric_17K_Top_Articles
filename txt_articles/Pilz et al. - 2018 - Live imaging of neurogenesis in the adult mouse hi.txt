Neural stem and progenitor cells (NSPCs) generate neurons throughout life in the
mammalian hippocampus. We used chronic in vivo imaging and followed genetically
labeled individual NSPCs and their progeny in the mouse hippocampus for up to 2
months. We show that NSPCs targeted by the endogenous Achaete-scute homolog
1 (Ascl1) promoter undergo limited rounds of symmetric and asymmetric divisions,
eliciting a burst of neurogenic activity, after which they are lost. Further, our data
reveal unexpected asymmetric divisions of nonradial glia-like NSPCs. Cell fates of
Ascl1-labeled lineages suggest a developmental-like program involving a sequential
transition from a proliferative to a neurogenic phase. By providing a comprehensive
description of lineage relationships, from dividing NSPCs to newborn neurons integrating
into the hippocampal circuitry, our data offer insight into how NSPCs support life-long
hippocampal neurogenesis.
T
he hippocampus requires new neurons in
the dentate gyrus (DG) throughout life for
learning and memory (1). Failing or altered
hippocampal neurogenesis has been impli-
cated in a variety of diseases such as major
depression and age-related cognitive decline (2, 3).
On the basis of thymidine analog labeling, in vivo
lineage tracing, and cell ablation studies, it has
been proposed that radial glia-like (R) progenitor
cells are the bona fide stem cells of the adult DG
(4–9). According to the prevailing model of adult
hippocampalneurogenesis,Rcellsself-renew—here
defined as generating a daughter cell with equiv-
alent molecular characteristics and potency—and
give rise to proliferative nonradial glia-like (NR)
cells that divide symmetrically to generate gran-
ule cells (3). However, the self-renewal capacity
and lineage relationships of R cells remain con-
troversial owing to the lack of longitudinal obser-
vations of individual R cells and their progeny
within their niche (7, 8). Similarly to previous
imaging approaches that have probed the dy-
namics of somatic stem cell behavior in the non-
mammalian nervous system and other stem cell
niches (10–17), we used chronic in vivo imaging
to track the fate of individual R cells over time
within the adult DG.
Chronic imaging of individual brain
stem cells
To label hippocampal R cells, we used mice ex-
pressing a tamoxifen (Tam)–regulable Cre re-
combinase under the control of the endogenous
Achaete-scute homolog 1 (Ascl1) promoter crossed
with a tdTomato reporter mouse line (Ascl1-
tdTomato mice) (18). Ascl1-expressing cells con-
stitute an essential population of neural stem
and progenitor cells (NSPCs) in the adult DG
(18–20). Adult Ascl1-tdTomato mice were im-
planted with a cortical window that left the
hippocampal formation intact and allowed for
two-photon imaging (Fig. 1A and fig. S1A) (21).
A single Tam injection induced sparse labeling
of Ascl1-expressing cells that were classified as
R or NR cells on the basis of morphological
features and marker expression (Fig. 1, B and
C; fig. S2; and movie S1). Only R cells were
analyzed as a starting population. Individual
clones were imaged every ~12 to 24 hours (un-
less otherwise indicated) and followed for up
to 2 months (Fig. 1, D and E, and fig. S3). Imaged
clones (n = 63) were characterized on the basis
of behavioral and morphological criteria (methods,
fig. S2, movie S2, and table S1), allowing for the
construction of individual lineage trees (Fig. 1E,
fig. S3, and movie S3). After imaging, the final
fate of progeny was confirmed using immuno-
histochemistry (Fig. 1, E and F, and fig. S4).
In agreement with previous static clonal lineage
tracing experiments, we found that in 8- to 9-week-
old Ascl1-tdTomato mice, 67% (42/63) of R cells
entered the cell cycle and became active during
the time course of imaging. Of these active R
cells, 88% (37/42) divided within the first 20 days
and, as a population, gave rise to both neuronal
and glial daughter cells (Fig. 1, D to F, and figs. S3
and S4, A to D) (19).
Once activated, cycling R cells divided 2.3 ± 0.1
times and persisted for 9.6 ± 1.4 days on average
(Fig. 2A and fig. S3). We did not find Ascl1-
targeted R cells that generated neuronal progeny
and returned to long-term (>4 weeks) quiescence
within the 2-month observational period in any
analyzed clones (Fig. 2A and figs. S3 and S4E).
This suggests that, once activated, Ascl1-targeted
R cells do not reenter long-term quiescence but
generate a burst of neurogenic activity before
committing to terminal neuronal differentiation
and loss (Fig. 2A and figs. S3 and S4, E to H). The
average clone size derived from active R cells was
4.8 ± 0.5 cells (Fig. 2B and fig. S3). We found no
evidence for terminal differentiation of R cells
into astrocytes, which had been suggested for
nestin-expressing NSPCs after several rounds of
cell division (8) (figs. S3 and S4H). Thus, the self-
renewal capacity of Ascl1-targeted R cells is tem-
porally limited; this finding is similar to previous
results obtained using population-based static
analysis of nestin-labeled NSPCs (8).
Cell division history is associated
with cell fate
We then considered the fate behavior of ac-
tivated R cells and their progeny. Previously, it
has been proposed that the predominant mode
of R cell division is asymmetric (6–8, 22). How-
ever, without access to continuous in vivo cell
tracking, evidence for asymmetric fate has been
indirect. Morphological analyses of cell body
and radial glia-like processes of R cells before
and after cell division revealed that the mor-
phology of R cells remained stable (Fig. 2, C and
D, and fig. S5A), providing direct evidence for
asymmetric cell divisions (6–8, 22). Although
the majority of observed first cell divisions were
asymmetric, generating a R cell and a NR cell
(79.3%; Fig. 2, E and F), we found that 13.8% of
first R cell divisions expanded the R cell pool
through symmetric divisions (Fig. 2, E and G),
mirroring the behavior found in static clonal
studies of R cells targeted by a nestin promoter
(7). With the further identification of direct neu-
rogenic cell divisions of R cells (Fig. 2E and figs.
S3 and S5, B and C), all three modes of division
were observed, reminiscent of the fate behavior
described for neural progenitors in the develop-
ing neocortex (23, 24). The majority (70.6%) of
all R cell divisions led to the generation of NR
cells that were identified on the basis of their
lack of a radial process, their ability to enter the
cell cycle, and their capacity to generate neu-
ronal progeny at later stages during the imaging
period (Fig. 2, E and F). In contrast to previously
suggested models (3), we found not only sym-
metric, neurogenic cell divisions of NR cells but
also a substantial fraction of asymmetric cell
divisions (24.2% of all NR divisions), yielding
one renewed NR cell and one neuronal daugh-
ter cell (Fig. 2, H to J) (9). NR cells underwent
as many as six rounds of cell division (with an
average of 2.9 ± 0.2 divisions); thus, NR cells are
a major source of clonal expansion (Fig. 2, H to
J, and fig. S3).
Chronic imaging also allowed us to analyze
whether division times (TD) are correlated with
previous cell divisions or within clonally re-
lated lineages. We analyzed the TD of R and NR

 divisions and found that, once the cells were
activated, TD remained constant (Fig. 2K). TD
times of sister cells were correlated among R cell
daughters, whereas no correlation was detected
for daughters of NR cells (Fig. 2, L and M), sug-
gesting segregation of cellular features selectively
in R cells that determine the daughter cells’ re-
entry into cell division.
Asymmetric segregation of cell death
within clonal lineages
Not all newborn cells survive and become stably
integratedintothe DGcircuitry.Two criticalperiods
of cell death have been described previously: an
early phase of cell death within the first days after
cell birth and a later phase of neuronal selection
that is activity-dependent and occurs about 1 to
3 weeks after new neurons are born (25–27). Con-
sistent with previous reports, we found an aver-
age frequency of cell death among the progeny
per lineage of 59.6% and identified two waves
of cell death occurring around 1 to 4 and 13 to
18 days after birth, respectively (Fig. 3, A and B)
(25–27). We identified interclonal variability,
with some clones showing no cell death, whereas
other clones completely disappeared over time
(Fig. 3A). Furthermore, we found differences re-
garding the susceptibility to cell death among
individual sublineages when analyzing levels of
early cell death (until 7 days after cell birth; Fig. 3,
C to F), suggesting that cell death is not evenly
distributed among progeny. The underlying cause
for the observed subtree-associated variability
of cell death remains unknown, but it may involve
intrinsicmechanisms—forexample,retrotransposon-
associated genetic alterations or unequal seg-
regation of aging factors (28, 29)—rather than
environmental, niche-dependent factors, such
as growth factor availability (3). Supporting this
interpretation, we found that surviving cells
can lie interspersed among death-prone cells
(Fig. 3G).
Developmental-like program describes
cell fate behavior
Inspection of reconstructed R cell lineages re-
vealed a wide variability in neurogenic potential
and fate outcomes (fig. S3). After induction,
some R cells differentiated early, giving rise to
one or two short-lived neurons, whereas others
gave rise to more than 10 surviving neurons (Fig.
2B and figs. S3 and S4F). Despite this variability,
some features of R cell fate behavior were con-
served among all lineage trees. In particular, we
foundnoinstanceofanasymmetricalRcelldivision
being followed by a symmetric R cell duplication
(Fig. 2E and fig. S3), suggesting either that, once
activated, R cells move sequentially from a sym-
metrically to an asymmetrically dividing phase, or
that the proliferative potential of R cells becomes
progressively exhausted so that symmetrical dupli-
cative divisions become increasingly scarce. In con-
trast, variability in the output of dividing NR cells
was indicative of a conserved pattern of stochastic

 fate, with NR cells choosing between symmetric
duplication, asymmetric division, and symmetric
differentiation with probabilities independent of
the cell generation (Fig. 2H and fig. S3).
Thus, on the basis of these observations, we
considered the quantitative fate behavior of R cells.
Given the sequential pattern of symmetric and
asymmetric divisions, we questioned whether
R cells might be following a developmental-like
program, switching irreversibly from a phase of
proliferative (symmetrical) divisions to a phase
of neurogenic (asymmetrical) divisions, as ob-
served during cortical development (Fig. 4A,
fig. S6A, and table S2) (30). Using a statistical
modeling approach, we quantitatively assessed
the viability of this hypothesis by fitting the
lengths of putative proliferative and neurogenic
phases against average clonal properties (methods).
This simple developmental-like paradigm yielded
predictions of the proliferative output, the cell
fate distributions, and the average clonal com-
position over time that were in agreement with
the observed data within the theoretically pre-
dicted variability (Fig. 4, B to D, and methods).
As a consistency check, we also assessed whether
the observed sequential fate pattern could rep-
resent the chance outcome of stochastic fate be-
havior, with R cells becoming progressively
biased away from self-renewal toward differ-
entiation over time (figs. S6 and S7). However,

 given the observed cell fate frequencies and the
number of observed lineage trees, we estimated
the chance for such an outcome to be only 2.4%
(methods). Thus, we conclude that a model in
which the sporadic entry of R cells into the cell
cycle activates a developmental-like program of
fate, leading to a burst of neurogenic activity,
provides the most plausible explanation of the
lineage data.
In this study, we used chronic imaging of in-
dividualRcellsandtheirprogenytocharacterize
thecellulardynamicsunderlyingadulthippocampal
neurogenesis. Our data show that, after activation,
Ascl1-targetedR cells enter a developmental-like
program, eliciting a burst of neurogenic activity.
However, self-renewal is temporally limited: We
did not observe repeated shuttling between quies-
cenceandproliferation,leadingtoalossofactivated

lated, and the Ascl1-targeted population analyzed
heremaynotincludeallsubtypesthatarecapable
of generating neuronal progeny in the adult DG
(33–35). Previous data suggested that about 10
to 15% of all granule cells are adult-generated
in the mouse hippocampus. This indicates that
adult neural stem cells generate 30,000 to 45,000
granule cells during the entire life span (5, 36, 37),
which, as a fraction of the total neuronal popula-
tion, appears to be lower in the rodentthan in the
human DG (38). We found that, once activated,
individual Ascl1-targeted R cells generated 4.8
neurons on average. On the basis of previous
estimates that the DG contains ~10,000 R cells in
2-month-old mice (8), the total number of cells
that can be generated by Ascl1-targeted cells with
the principles of clonal expansion described here
(~45,000) appears to be sufficient to explain a
substantial part of hippocampal neurogenesis.
Our in vivo imaging results elucidate the cellular
dynamics of physiological adult neurogenesis
and form the basis to understand the molecular
mechanisms governing the steps from dividing
stem cells to newborn neurons.
