Background: A 2007 American College of Physicians guideline
addressed nonpharmacologic treatment options for low back
pain. New evidence is now available.
Purpose: To systematically review the current evidence on non-
pharmacologic therapies for acute or chronic nonradicular or ra-
dicular low back pain.
Data Sources: Ovid MEDLINE (January 2008 through February
2016), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane
Database of Systematic Reviews, and reference lists.
Study Selection: Randomized trials of 9 nonpharmacologic op-
tions versus sham treatment, wait list, or usual care, or of 1 non-
pharmacologic option versus another.
Data Extraction: One investigator abstracted data, and a sec-
ond checked abstractions for accuracy; 2 investigators indepen-
dently assessed study quality.
Data Synthesis: The number of trials evaluating nonpharmaco-
logic therapies ranged from 2 (tai chi) to 121 (exercise). New
evidence indicates that tai chi (strength of evidence [SOE], low)
and mindfulness-based stress reduction (SOE, moderate) are ef-
fective for chronic low back pain and strengthens previous find-
ings regarding the effectiveness of yoga (SOE, moderate).
Evidence continues to support the effectiveness of exercise, psy-
chological therapies, multidisciplinary rehabilitation, spinal ma-
nipulation, massage, and acupuncture for chronic low back pain
(SOE, low to moderate). Limited evidence shows that acupunc-
ture is modestly effective for acute low back pain (SOE, low). The
magnitude of pain benefits was small to moderate and generally
short term; effects on function generally were smaller than ef-
fects on pain.
Limitation: Qualitatively synthesized new trials with prior meta-
analyses, restricted to English-language studies; heterogeneity
in treatment techniques; and inability to exclude placebo effects.
Conclusion: Several nonpharmacologic therapies for primarily
chronic low back pain are associated with small to moderate,
usually short-term effects on pain; findings include new evidence
on mind–body interventions.

L
ow back pain is very common and is associated with
more global disability than any other condition (1).
Several nonpharmacologic, noninvasive therapies are
available for low back pain, including exercise, comple-
mentary and alternative therapies (such as spinal ma-
nipulation, acupuncture, massage, and mind–body in-
terventions), psychological therapies (such as cognitive
behavioral and operant therapy), physical techniques
(such as traction, ultrasound, transcutaneous electrical
nerve stimulation, low-level laser therapy, superficial
heat or cold, and back supports), and multidisciplinary
rehabilitation.
A 2007 guideline (2) and an associated systematic
review (3) from the American College of Physicians (ACP)
and American Pain Society (APS) recommended spinal
manipulation as a treatment option for acute low back
pain and several nonpharmacologic therapies for sub-
acute or chronic low back pain. New evidence is now
available. The purpose of this article is to review the cur-
rent evidence on the benefits and harms of nonpharma-
cologic therapies for low back pain. The ACP will use this
review to develop an updated clinical practice guideline.
METHODS
Detailed methods for this review, including the an-
alytic framework, additional nonpharmacologic thera-
pies (physical techniques), medications (addressed in a
separate article) (4), search strategies, inclusion criteria,
data extraction and quality-rating methods, and addi-
tional outcomes (such as quality of life, global improve-
ment, and patient satisfaction) are available in the full
report (5). The protocol was developed by using a stan-
dardized process (6) with input from experts and the
public and is registered in the PROSPERO database (7).
This article addresses the following question: What are
the comparative benefits and harms of nonpharmaco-
logic, noninvasive therapies for acute or chronic nonra-
dicular or radicular low back pain or for symptomatic
spinal stenosis?

Study Selection
Two

independently
reviewed
ab-
stracts
and
full-text
articles
against
prespecified
eligibility criteria. The population was adults with acute
(<4 weeks), subacute (4 to 12 weeks), or chronic (≥12
weeks) nonradicular or radicular low back pain. Ex-
cluded conditions were low back pain due to cancer,
infection,
inflammatory
arthropathy,
high-velocity
trauma, or fracture; low back pain during pregnancy;
and the presence of severe or progressive neurologic
deficits. We included randomized trials of exercise,
spinal
manipulation,
acupuncture,
massage,
mind–
body interventions (yoga, tai chi, mindfulness-based
stress reduction), psychological therapies, or multidis-
ciplinary rehabilitation versus sham (functionally inert)
treatment, wait list, or usual care (usually defined as
care provided at the discretion of the clinician), as well
as comparisons between 1 therapy and another. Out-
comes were long-term (≥1 year) or short-term (≤6
months) pain, function, return to work, and harms.
Given the large number of interventions, we in-
cluded systematic reviews of randomized trials (6, 9).
For each intervention, we selected the most recent, rel-
evant, and comprehensive systematic review that was
of the highest quality on the basis of a validated assess-
ment tool (9, 10). If more than 1 good-quality system-
atic review was available, we preferentially selected up-
dates of reviews used in the ACP/APS review. We
supplemented systematic reviews with additional ran-
domized trials. We did not include systematic reviews
identified in update searches but checked reference
lists for additional studies. We excluded non–English-
language articles and abstract-only publications.
Data Extraction and Quality Assessment
One investigator extracted study data, and a sec-
ond verified the accuracy of the extractions. For system-
atic reviews, we abstracted details about review meth-
ods and results (Supplement Table 1, available at
Annals.org). For randomized trials not included in a sys-
tematic review, we abstracted details regarding the
study, population, and treatment characteristics, as well
as the results (Supplement Table 2, available at Annals
.org).
Two
investigators
independently
assessed
the
quality of each study as good, fair, or poor by using
criteria developed by the U.S. Preventive Services Task
Force (11) (for randomized trials [Supplement Table 3,
available at Annals.org]) and AMSTAR (A Measurement
Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews; for systematic re-
views [Supplement Table 4, available at Annals.org])
(9).
For primary studies included in systematic reviews,
we relied on the quality ratings as performed in the
reviews. We used the overall grade (for example, good,
fair, or poor; or high or low) as determined in the sys-
tematic review.
We classified the magnitude of effects for pain and
function by using the same system used in the ACP/
APS review (Table 1) (2, 12). We also reported risk es-
timates based on the proportion of patients achieving
successful pain or function outcomes (such as >30% or
>50% improvement).
Data Synthesis and Analysis
We synthesized data qualitatively for each interven-
tion, stratified according to the duration of symptoms
(acute, subacute, or chronic) and presence or absence
of radicular symptoms. We reported meta-analysis re-
sults from systematic reviews. If statistical heterogeneity
was present, we examined the degree of inconsistency
and evaluated subgroup and sensitivity analyses. We
did not conduct an updated meta-analysis; rather, we
qualitatively examined whether the results of new stud-
ies were consistent with pooled or qualitative findings
from previous systematic reviews. Qualitative assess-
ments were based on whether the findings from the
new studies were in the same direction as those of the
previous systematic reviews and whether the magni-
tude of effects was similar; if previous meta-analyses
were available, we assessed whether the estimates and
CIs from the new studies were encompassed in the
CIs of previous pooled estimates. We assessed the
strength of evidence (SOE) for each body of evidence

Role of the Funding Source
This project was funded by the Agency for Health-
care Research and Quality (AHRQ), U.S. Department of
Health and Human Services. Staff members of AHRQ
assisted in developing the scope and key questions.
The AHRQ had no role in study selection, quality as-
sessment, or synthesis.
RESULTS
The search and selection of articles are summa-
rized in the literature flow diagram (Figure). Database
searches resulted in 2847 potentially relevant articles.
After dual review of abstracts and titles, we selected
814 articles for full-text dual review; 114 publications
met our inclusion criteria. Details for the systematic re-
views included are shown in Supplement Table 1, and
details for additional trials included are shown in Sup-
plement Table 2; quality ratings are shown in Supple-
ment Table 3 (systematic reviews) and Supplement Ta-
ble 4 (trials).
Exercise
We found 122 trials that evaluated exercise. Three
systematic reviews included 71 unique trials (total sam-
ple sizes ranged from 1993 to 4138) (13–15), and we
identified 51 additional trials (sample sizes, ≥100 in 18
trials [16–34] and <100 in 33). One systematic review
focused on exercise for chronic low back pain (37 trials)
(14), 1 evaluated the effects of exercise on work disabil-
ity in patients with subacute or chronic low back pain
(23 trials) (15), and 1 examined the effects of motor
control exercise (MCE) (16 trials) (13). One review clas-
sified 41% of trials as low risk of bias, and another clas-
sified 62% as high quality; among the additional trials
with 100 or more patients, we rated 4 good, 7 fair, and
7 poor quality.
For acute (3 trials) or subacute (5 trials) low back
pain, the ACP/APS review previously found no differ-

 ence between exercise therapy and no exercise on
pain. Three additional trials of exercise versus no exer-
cise or usual care reported inconsistent effects on pain
and function (21, 31, 32).
For chronic low back pain, the ACP/APS review
found that exercise was associated with greater pain
relief than no exercise (19 trials: weighted mean differ-
ence [WMD], 10 on a 0- to 100-point scale [95% CI,
1.31 to 19.09]); the effects on function were small and
not statistically significant (17 trials: WMD, 3.00 on a 0-
to 100-point scale [CI, �0.53 to 6.48]). In a more recent
systematic review that used more restrictive criteria, ex-
ercise therapy was associated with less pain intensity (3
trials: WMD, �9.23 [CI, �16.02 to �2.43]) and better
function (3 randomized, controlled trials: WMD, �12.35
on a 0- to 100-point scale [CI, �23.0 to �1.69]) versus
usual care at treatment end; the effects were smaller
at long-term follow-up (mean difference, �4.94 [CI,
�10.45 to 0.58] for pain and �3.17 [CI, �5.96 to
�0.38] for function) (14). Another systematic review
found that compared with minimal intervention, MCE
decreased pain intensity (2 trials: WMD, �12.48 on a 0-
to 100-point scale [CI, �19.04 to �5.93] short term and
13.32 [CI, �19.75 to �6.90] long term) and improved
function (3 trials: WMD, �9.00 on a 0- to 100-point
scale [CI, �15.28 to �2.73] short term; 2 trials: WMD,
�6.64 [CI, �11.72 to �1.57] long term) (13). Still an-
other systematic review found an association between
exercise and a lower likelihood of work disability at
long-term follow-up (about 12 months) (10 compari-
sons in 8 trials: odds ratio, 0.66 [CI, 0.48 to 0.92]), with
no statistically significant effects in the shorter term
(15). Among trials of exercise versus no exercise or
usual care not included in the systematic reviews, 15 of
22 found exercise to be more effective for pain
and 12 of 17 found exercise to be more effective for
function.
For radicular low back pain, 3 trials (n = 181 to 348)
found exercise to be more effective than usual care or
no exercise for pain or function, but the effects were
small (16, 17, 25).
A systematic review found that compared with gen-
eral exercise, MCE was associated with less pain inten-
sity in the short term (6 trials: WMD, �7.80 on a 0- to
100-point scale [CI, �10.95 to �4.65]) and intermedi-
ate term (3 trials: WMD, �6.06 [CI, �10.94 to �1.18]);
however, the differences were smaller and no longer
statistically significant in the long term (4 trials: WMD,
�3.10 [CI, �7.03 to 0.83]) (13). In addition, MCE was
associated with better short-term (6 trials: WMD, �4.65
on a 0- to 100-point scale [CI, �6.20 to �3.11]) and
long-term (3 trials: WMD, �4.72 [CI, �8.81 to �0.63])
function. Three subsequent trials generally were consis-
tent with the systematic review in finding MCE slightly
more effective than general exercise for pain or func-
tion (30, 33, 34). For comparisons involving other types
of exercise techniques, no clear differences were ob-
served in more than 20 head-to-head trials of acute or
chronic back pain.
Tai Chi
Two fair-quality trials (n = 160 and 320) (35, 36)
found that tai chi reduced pain versus wait list or no tai
chi (mean differences, 0.9 and 1.3, respectively, on a 0-
to 10-point scale); 1 trial (35) also found greater im-
provement in function (mean difference, 2.6 on the
Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire [RDQ] [CI, 1.1 to
3.7]).
Yoga
Fourteen trials evaluated yoga for chronic low back
pain. Ten trials (n = 1056; range, 12 to 313) were in a
systematic review (37), and we identified 4 additional
trials (n = 375; range, 60 to 159) (38, 39). Eight trials in
the systematic review were rated as low risk of bias; we
rated 2 other trials as fair and 2 as good quality.
One trial found that compared with usual care,
Iyengar yoga was associated with lower pain scores (24
vs. 37 on a visual analogue scale [VAS] of 0 to 100; P <
0.001) and better function (18 vs. 21 on the 0- to 100-
point Oswestry Disability Index; P < 0.01) at 24 weeks
(40). Five trials generally found yoga to be associated
with lower pain intensity and better function versus ex-
ercise, although the effects were small and differences
were not always statistically significant (38, 41–44).
Compared with education, yoga was associated with
lower short-term pain intensity (5 trials: standardized
mean difference [SMD], �0.45 [CI, �0.63 to �0.26; I2 =
0%]), but the effects were smaller and not statistically
significant at longer-term follow-up; yoga also was as-
sociated with better function at short-term (5 trials:
SMD, 0.45 [CI, �0.65 to �0.25; I2 = 8%]) and long-term
(4 trials: SMD, 0.39 [CI, �0.66 to �0.11; I2 = 40%])
follow-up (37).
Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction
Three trials (n = 40, 282, and 342) evaluated
mindfulness-based stress reduction (8 weekly group
sessions) for chronic low back pain (45–47). Two trials
were rated as good quality (45, 47) and 1 as poor qual-
ity. In 1 trial, participants in a mindfulness-based stress
reduction program had greater improvement in short-
term back pain (difference, �0.64 point on a 0- to 10-
pont numeric rating scale) and function (difference,
�1.37 on the RDQ) at 26 weeks than those receiving
usual care (45). They also were more likely to have pain
reduction of 30% or more (relative risk, 1.64 [CI, 1.15 to
2.34]) and better function (relative risk, 1.37 [CI, 1.06 to
1.77]). The effects on pain (difference, �0.85 point) but
not function remained at 52 weeks. No differences
were observed between mindfulness-based stress re-
duction and cognitive behavioral therapy. Another
good-quality trial found that compared with an educa-
tion intervention, mindfulness-based stress reduction
led to a greater increase in function at 8 weeks (differ-
ence, �1.1 on the RDQ [CI, �2.1 to �0.01]) but no
statistically significant effects on average pain intensity
(46); no differences were seen in average pain intensity
or function at 6 months. The third trial, a small (n = 40)
pilot study, also found mindfulness-based stress reduc-
tion to be superior to an education intervention for pain

 and function, although the researchers reported base-
line differences in these measures (47).
Psychological Therapies
Thirty-two trials evaluated psychological therapies
for chronic low back pain. Of these studies, 28 were
included in a systematic review (n = 3090; range, 18 to
409) (48), and we identified 4 additional trials (n = 976;
range, 54 to 701) (49–53). The review classified 13 trials
as low risk of bias; we rated all the others as fair quality.
The systematic review found that compared with
wait-list control or no psychological therapy, progres-
sive relaxation (3 trials: mean difference, �19.77 on a 0-
to 100-point VAS [CI, �34 to �5.20]), electromyogra-
phy biofeedback (3 trials: SMD, �0.80 [CI, �1.32 to
�0.28]), operant therapy (3 trials: SMD, �0.43 [CI,
�0.75 to �0.1]), and cognitive behavioral therapy (5
trials: SMD, �0.60 [CI, �0.97 to �0.22]) resulted in
lower posttreatment pain intensity (48). Only progres-
sive relaxation was associated with beneficial effects on
function (3 trials: SMD, �0.88 [CI, �1.36 to �0.39]). No
clear differences in pain intensity were seen between
psychological therapies and exercise therapy (2 trials)
or in pain or function between psychological therapies
plus physiotherapy and physiotherapy alone (6 trials)
(48). Ten trials found no clear differences among sev-
eral psychological therapies (48).
Multidisciplinary Rehabilitation
Multidisciplinary rehabilitation was evaluated in 44
trials. Of these studies, 41 (n = 6858; range, 20 to 542)
were included in a systematic review (54), and we iden-
tified 3 others (n = 20, 20, and 70) (55–57). The system-
atic review classified 13 trials as low risk of bias; we
rated 2 others as good quality and 1 as fair quality.
The systematic review found that patients with
chronic low back pain who received multidisciplinary
rehabilitation had lower short-term pain intensity than
those who received usual care (9 trials: SMD, �0.55 [CI,
�0.83 to �0.28]), no multidisciplinary rehabilitation (3
trials: SMD, �0.73 [CI, �1.22 to �0.24]), or nonmulti-
disciplinary physical therapy (12 trials: SMD, �0.30 [CI,
�0.54 to �0.06]) (54). On a numerical rating scale of 0
to 10 points, the differences were approximately 1.4 to
1.7 points versus usual care or no multidisciplinary re-
habilitation and approximately 0.6 point versus non-
multidisciplinary physical therapy. Multidisciplinary re-
habilitation also was associated with less short-term
disability (9 trials: SMD, �0.41 [CI, �0.62 to �0.19; I2 =
58%]; 3 trials: SMD, �0.49 [CI, �0.76 to �0.22]; and 13
trials: SMD, �0.39 [CI, �0.68 to �0.10], respectively).
On the RDQ, the differences were approximately 2.5 to
2.9 points versus usual care or no multidisciplinary re-
habilitation and approximately 1.2 points versus non-

Multidisciplinary
rehabilitation also was associated with less long-term
pain intensity and disability than usual care (7 trials:
SMD, �0.21 [CI, �0.37 to �0.04], and 6 trials: SMD,
�0.23 [CI, �0.40 to �0.06], respectively) and nonmul-
tidisciplinary physical therapy (9 trials: SMD, �0.51 [CI,
�1.04 to 0.01], and 10 trials: SMD, �0.68 [CI, �1.19 to
�0.16], respectively) and with greater likelihood of re-
turn to work compared with nonmultidisciplinary reha-
bilitation (8 trials: odds ratio, 1.87 [CI, 1.39 to 2.53]),
with no difference versus usual care (7 trials: odds ratio,
1.04 [CI, 0.73 to 1.47]). Two trials in patients with sub-
acute low back pain reported findings consistent with
those in patients with chronic symptoms (55, 56).
Acupuncture
Acupuncture was evaluated in 49 trials. Of these
studies, 11 (n = 1163; range, 40 to 300) were in a sys-
tematic review of acupuncture for acute or subacute
low back pain (58) and 32 (n = 5931; range, 16 to 2831)
in a systematic review of acupuncture for chronic low
back pain (59), and we identified 6 additional trials (n =
864; range, 80 to 275) (60–64). The systematic reviews
categorized 22% and 45% of trials as low risk of bias;
we rated 3 additional trials as good, 2 as fair, and 1 as
poor quality.
For acute low back pain, a systematic review found
that acupuncture decreased pain intensity more than
sham acupuncture with nonpenetrating needles (2 tri-
als: mean difference, 9.38 on a 0-to 100-point VAS [CI,
1.76 to 17.0]) (58). Two other trials reported inconsis-
tent effects on pain intensity (61, 65). Acupuncture had
no clear effects on function (5 trials) (58, 61, 62). Com-
pared with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, acu-
puncture was associated with a slightly greater likeli-
hood of overall improvement at the end of treatment (5
trials: relative risk, 1.11 [CI, 1.06 to 1.16]).
For chronic low back pain, the systematic review
found that acupuncture was associated with lower pain
intensity (4 trials: SMD, �0.72 [CI, �0.94 to –0.49]) and
better function (3 trials: SMD, �0.94 [CI, �1.41 to
�0.47]) immediately after the intervention compared
with no acupuncture (59). Mean effects on pain ranged
from 7 to 24 points on a 0- to 100-point scale; for func-
tion, 1 trial reported an 8-point difference on a 0- to
100-point scale and 2 trials reported differences of 0.8
and 3.4 points on the RDQ. In the long term, 2 trials
showed small or no clear differences. Acupuncture also
decreased pain intensity more than sham acupuncture
immediately after the intervention (4 trials: WMD,
�16.76 [CI, �33.3 to �0.19]) and through 12 weeks (3
trials: WMD, �9.55 [CI, �16.5 to �2.58]), with no dif-
ferences in function. Five trials that could not be pooled
or were not included in the review reported results con-
sistent with these findings (60, 66–69). The systematic
review found that compared with medications (non-
steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, muscle relaxants, or
analgesics), acupuncture resulted in greater pain relief
(3 trials: WMD, �10.56 on a 0- to 100-point scale [CI,
�20.34 to �0.78]) and better function (3 trials: SMD,
�0.36 [CI, �0.67 to �0.04]) immediately after the
intervention.
Massage
Massage was evaluated in 26 trials, 13 of which (n =
1596; range, 39 to 262) were included in a systematic
review (70); we identified another 13 trials (n = 1633;
range, 15 to 579) (29, 71–82). The systematic review
classified 6 trials as low risk of bias, and we rated 3
additional trials (29, 71, 72) as good quality.
For chronic low back pain, 1 trial found that struc-
tural or relaxation massage had small effects on the
RDQ (mean, 2.0 to 2.9 points) versus usual care at 10 to
12 weeks, with smaller effects at 52 weeks (71); how-
ever, another trial found no RDQ effects from massage
(Swedish massage, soft tissue release, and stretching)
versus usual care (29). Three trials found no clear differ-
ence in pain or function between foot reflexology and
usual care or sham (light foot) massage (79, 81, 83).
Compared with several noninvasive interventions
(manipulation, exercise, relaxation therapy, acupunc-
ture, physiotherapy, transcutaneous electrical nerve
stimulation), massage had better effects on short-term
pain in 8 of 9 trials (mean differences, �0.6 to �0.94
points on a 0- to 10-point scale) and short-term function
in 4 of 5 trials (70, 82). Comparisons of various massage
techniques were heterogeneous, and estimates were
imprecise (71–74, 80, 84, 85).
Spinal Manipulation
Spinal manipulation was evaluated in 61 trials. Of
these studies, 19 (n = 2674; range, 36 to 323) were
included in a systematic review of manipulation for
acute low back pain (86) and 26 (n = 6070; range, 29 to
1334) in a systematic review of manipulation for chronic
low back pain (87), and we identified an additional 16

 trials (n = 2382; range, 40 to 400) (18, 88–102). The
reviews classified 15 trials as low risk of bias, and we
rated 1 additional trial (102) as good quality.
For acute low back pain, 2 trials found that spinal
manipulation had greater effects on function than sham
manipulation (these differences were statistically signif-
icant in 1 trial); 1 trial found no statistically significant
effects on pain (97, 103). The systematic review found
no differences in pain relief at 1 week between spinal
manipulation and treatments considered inactive (an
educational booklet, detuned ultrasound, detuned or
actual short-wave diathermy, antiedema gel, or bed
rest) (3 trials: WMD, 0.14 on a 0- to 10-point scale [CI,
�0.69 to 0.96]), although 1 trial found an association
between manipulation and greater pain relief at 3
months (mean difference, �1.20 [CI, 2.11 to �0.29]);
no differences in function were seen at 1 week (2 trials)
or 3 months (1 trial) (86). In addition, no differences
were observed in pain relief between patients receiving
spinal manipulation and those receiving interventions
considered active (primarily exercise, physical therapy,
and back school) at 1 week (3 trials: WMD, 0.06 on a 0-
to 10-point scale [CI, �0.53 to 0.65]) through 1 year (1
trial: mean difference, 0.40 [CI, �0.08 to 0.88]), nor
were any effects on function noted. A subsequent trial
reported similar findings (96).
For chronic low back pain, a systematic review
showed that spinal manipulation had small, statistically
nonsignificant effects on pain at 1 month compared
with sham manipulation (3 trials: WMD, �3.24 [CI,
�13.62 to 7.15 on a 0- to 100-point scale]); 1 trial re-
ported similar results for function (SMD, �0.45 [CI,
�0.97 to 0.06]) (87). A trial not included in the system-
atic review reported results that generally were consis-
tent with it (94). Compared with other active interven-
tions, manipulation was associated with better short-
term pain relief at 1 month (10 comparisons from 6
trials: WMD, �2.76 on a 0- to 100-point scale [CI, �5.19
to �0.32]) and 6 months (7 comparisons from 4 trials:
WMD, �3.07 [CI, �5.42 to �0.71]), although the mag-
nitude of effects was below the small or slight thresh-
old. No effect was observed at 12 months (3 trials:
WMD, �0.76 [CI, �3.19 to 1.66]). Manipulation re-
sulted in greater improvement in function than other
active interventions at 1 month (10 comparisons from 6
trials: SMD, �0.17 [CI, �0.29 to �0.06]); the effects
were smaller and no longer statistically significant
at 6 and 12 months. Three trials not included in the
systematic reviews reported consistent findings with it
(18, 90, 93).
For radicular low back pain, 1 good-quality trial
found that spinal manipulation plus home exercise and
advice resulted in greater improvement in leg and back
pain at 12 weeks than home exercise and advice alone
(mean difference, about 1 point on a 0- to 10-point
scale); the effects were smaller (0.3 to 0.7 points) and
not statistically significant at 52 weeks (99).
Harms
Across interventions, no serious harms were noted,
although the reporting of harms was suboptimal. Typi-
cal harms reported were temporary increases in low
back pain or other local effects (such as pain or bleed-
ing from insertion of acupuncture needles).
DISCUSSION
Some evidence supports the effectiveness of sev-
eral nonpharmacologic therapies for chronic low back
pain (Table 2 and Supplement Table 5, available at
Annals.org), and limited evidence shows that acupunc-
ture is effective for acute low back pain (Table 3 and
Supplement Table 6, available at Annals.org). These
benefits generally were seen for short-term pain (usu-
ally <3 months and often immediately after the inter-
vention) and of small (5 to 10 points on a 100-point
VAS) to moderate (10 to 20 points) magnitude, on the
basis of the ACP/APS categories (104). Function was
reported less consistently than pain, and effects typi-
cally were smaller or not observed. Exercise and multi-
disciplinary rehabilitation were associated with an in-
creased likelihood of return to work. As described in
the full report (5), evidence on other outcomes (such as
quality of life, mood, analgesic use, and health care
use) was sparse. Evidence on the effectiveness of non-
pharmacologic therapies for radiculopathy was very
limited (Table 4). Few clear differences were seen be-
tween various nonpharmacologic therapies in head-to-
head trials, but evidence for most comparisons was
limited.
This report updates and expands on the earlier
ACP/APS review (105) with additional interventions and
newer evidence. We found evidence that mind–body
interventions not previously addressed—tai chi (SOE,
low) and mindfulness-based stress reduction (SOE,
moderate) (45–47)—are effective for chronic low back
pain; the new evidence also strengthens previous con-
clusions regarding yoga effectiveness (SOE, moderate).
For interventions recommended as treatment options
in the 2007 ACP/APS guideline (2), our findings were
generally consistent with the prior review. Specifically,
exercise therapy, psychological therapies, multidisci-
plinary rehabilitation, spinal manipulation, massage,
and acupuncture are supported with some evidence of
effectiveness for chronic low back pain (SOE, low to
moderate). Unlike our previous report, which stated

 that
higher-intensity
multidisciplinary
rehabilitation
seemed to be more effective than lower-intensity pro-
grams, a stratified analysis based on currently available
evidence (54) did not find a clear intensity effect. Our
findings generally are consistent with recent systematic
reviews not included in our evidence synthesis (106–
117). Although harms were not well-reported, serious
adverse events were not described.
As detailed in the full report, we found little evi-
dence to support the use of most passive physical ther-
apies (such as interferential therapy, short-wave dia-
thermy, traction, ultrasound, lumbar supports, taping,
and electrical muscle stimulation) for low back pain (5).
Exceptions were superficial heat, which was more effec-
tive than a nonheated control for acute or subacute low
back pain (SOE, moderate), and low-level laser therapy,
which was more effective than sham laser for pain
(SOE, low) (118–120).
We categorized the magnitude of effects for pain
and function by using the thresholds in the ACP/APS
review. Effects classified as small (for example, 5 to 10
points on a 0- to 100-point scale for pain or function)
are below some proposed minimum thresholds for clin-
ically important differences (such as 15 points on a 0- to
100-point VAS for pain, 2 points on a 0- to 10-point
numerical rating scale for pain or function, 5 points on
the RDQ, and 10 points on the Oswestry Disability In-
dex) (12). Factors that may support the use of interven-
tions associated with small effects include low risk for
harms, low costs, and strong patient preferences. The
magnitude of effects may vary depending on baseline
severity (121); most trials enrolled patients with at least
moderate pain (for example, rated as >5 on a 0- to
10-point numeric rating scale).
Our findings have implications for clinical practice.
Current guidelines do not include mindfulness-based
stress reduction, which was as effective as cognitive be-
havioral therapy for chronic low back pain (45). Recent
guidelines recommend nonopioid over opioid therapy
for chronic pain; yet access to and reimbursement for
certain nonpharmacologic therapies remain limited
(122, 123). For acute low back pain, most patients im-
prove with or without therapy. Therefore, strategies
that target effective therapies to patients at higher risk
for chronicity may be most efficient (124).
Our review had limitations. Because of the large
number of interventions, reviewing all of the primary
literature was not feasible. We included higher-quality,
recent systematic reviews that were most relevant to
the review scope (125), supplemented with additional
primary trials. We did not update meta-analyses re-
ported in systematic reviews, but we qualitatively eval-
uated the consistency of results from new trials against
pooled estimates. We excluded non–English-language
articles and did not search for abstract-only publica-
tions. We were limited in our ability to assess for pub-
lication bias because of the small numbers of trials for
most comparisons, methodological limitations, and
study heterogeneity. We did not address some non-
pharmacologic interventions, including education (126,
127), advice to remain active (126, 128), mattresses,
and shoe insoles (129), or compare nonpharmacologic
therapies with surgical or interventional procedures.
Limitations also existed in the evidence base. Ef-
fects on pain and function typically were reported as
mean differences at or shortly after intervention, mak-
ing it difficult to determine whether benefits were sus-
tained. Few studies reported the likelihood of clinically
significant improvements (130). For each intervention,
trials were heterogeneous regarding the techniques
used, the number of treatment sessions, and the dura-
tion or intensity of sessions. For example, acupuncture
trials varied in needling sites; the length, number, and
duration of acupuncture sessions; and the type of sham
treatment (for example, nonpenetrating needles at the
acupuncture site vs. penetrating needles at the nonacu-
puncture site) (58, 59). For many nonpharmacologic in-
terventions, effectively blinding patients or care provid-
ers to treatments is difficult, so some observed effects
might have been the result of nonspecific effects re-
lated to needling, massage, manipulation, or other
treatment administration aspects (such as attentional or
placebo effects) (131, 132).
In conclusion, several nonpharmacologic therapies
for low back pain were associated with small to moder-
ate, primarily short-term effects on pain. Effects on
function generally were smaller than those on pain, and
most evidence was for chronic low back pain. New ev-
idence supports the effectiveness of mind–body inter-
ventions. More research is needed to identify effective
nonpharmacologic treatments for radicular and acute
low back pain and to understand the incremental ben-
efits of combining interventions, as well as which treat-
ment combinations and sequences are most effective.
