Abstract
Introduction: Cognitive training improves cognitive performance and delays functional impair-
ment, but its effects on dementia are not known. We examined whether three different types of
cognitive training lowered the risk of dementia across 10 years of follow-up relative to control and
if greater number of training sessions attended was associated with lower dementia risk.
Methods: The Advanced Cognitive Training in Vital Elderly (NCT00298558) study was a random-
ized controlled trial (N 5 2802) among initially healthy older adults, which examined the efficacy of
three cognitive training programs (memory, reasoning, or speed of processing) relative to a no-contact
control condition. Up to 10 training sessions were delivered over 6 weeks with up to four sessions of
booster training delivered at 11 months and a second set of up to four booster sessions at 35 months.
Outcome assessments were taken immediately after intervention and at intervals over 10 years.
Dementia was defined using a combination of interview- and performance-based methods.
Results: A total of 260 cases of dementia were identified during the follow-up. Speed training
resulted in reduced risk of dementia (hazard ratio [HR] 0.71, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.50–
0.998, P 5 .049) compared to control, but memory and reasoning training did not (HR 0.79, 95%
CI 0.57–1.11, P 5 .177 and HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.56–1.10, P 5 .163, respectively). Each additional
speed training session was associated with a 10% lower hazard for dementia (unadjusted HR,
0.90; 95% CI, 0.85–0.95, P , .001).
Discussion: Initially, healthy older adults randomized to speed of processing cognitive training had a
29% reduction in their risk of dementia after 10 years of follow-up compared to the untreated control
group.

1. Introduction
Dementia affects 14% of persons aged 71 years and
older and 30% of those over the age 90 [1]. A 2010 study
estimated that 34.4 million people have dementia world-
wide with estimated formal and informal care costs of
$422 billion [2]. Interventions that postpone dementia
onset by even two years would cut projected dementia
prevalence in 2047 by 22% [3].
Results were presented at the 2016 Alzheimer’s Association Interna-
tional Conference in Toronto, Canada.

 The Advanced Training in Vital Elderly study (ACTIVE)
[4] was a randomized trial on the efficacy of three different
types of cognitive training to preserve cognitive and daily
function in older adults. Participants were randomized to
either strategy-based memory or reasoning training, speed
of processing training, or no-contact control conditions
[4]. Cognitive training produced longitudinal improvements
on the targeted cognitive outcomes, and trained participants
self-reported less difficulty completing instrumental activ-
ities of daily living (IADL) 10 years later [5–7]. As
dementia by definition involves functional impairments, of
interest is whether these interventions reduced dementia
risk. Previous analysis of ACTIVE using a combination of
self-report and performance-based definitions of dementia
found no difference in rate of dementia by training arm at
5 years [8].
Importantly, ACTIVE subanalyses have shown that, as hy-
pothesized [4], exposure to booster training was associated
with larger improvements in cognitive performance and wider
transfer to daily function, particularly for the reasoning and
speed arms [5,9,10]. Participants randomized to greater
doses of speed training demonstrated improved functional
performance at 1, 2, and 5 years [5,9]. Exposure to booster
training was associated with additional improvement in
targeted cognitive performance at 10 years for participants
receiving reasoning and speed training [5–7,9,10]. Thus,
consideration of training dose is necessary.
Given the additional follow-up in ACTIVE and the indi-
cations that booster training enhances outcomes, it was of in-
terest to reexamine the relation between training and
dementia across 10 years. We hypothesized that exposure
to cognitive training would lower the risk of dementia and
that the benefit would be greatest for those attending more
training sessions (i.e., booster training).
2. Methods
2.1. Study design and participants
ACTIVE was a multi-site, single-blind, 4-arm, randomized
trial
(NCT00298558,
see
Fig.
1).
Participants
were
community-dwelling adults aged 65 years and older. Partici-
pants were excluded if they had significant cognitive dysfunc-
tion (Mini-mental State Examination [MMSE] , 23), any
functional impairment (self-reported difficulty indexed by
the Minimum Data Set [MDS] home care), poor vision,
self-reported diagnoses of Alzheimer’s disease, stroke, certain
cancers, or communication difficulties [4]. Written informed
consent was obtained. The study was approved by site Institu-
tional Review Boards.
2.2. Procedures
The study protocol is detailed elsewhere [4]. Briefly,
eligible participants completed baseline assessments of cogni-
tive (i.e., memory, reasoning, and speed of processing) and
functional abilities (i.e., self-report and performance-based
measures of functional abilities) and were randomized
(Fig. 1). Memory training focused on instruction and practice
in strategy use for verbal episodic memory. Reasoning
training focused on instruction and practice in strategy use
related to problem-solving and serial patterns. Speed training
focused on computerized, visual-perceptual exercises de-
signed to increase the amount and complexity of information
quickly processed. Each training arm consisted of ten 60–
75 minute sessions over 5 to 6 weeks, delivered to small
groups of participants. A subset of participants completing
at least 80% of the training sessions was randomly selected
to receive booster training (four 75-minute sessions) at 11
and 35 months after completion of the initial training. Thus,
Fig. 1. The Advanced Cognitive Training in Vital Elderly study design. Participants were randomized to one of four training arms and assessed immediately
after training or an equivalent delay. Assessments were completed at 1, 2, 3, 5, and 10 years. A subset of participants completed four additional booster training
sessions at 11 months and again at 35 months.

 the total “dose” of each type of training could range from
0–18 sessions. Outcome assessments occurred immediately
after training and at 1, 2, 3, 5, and 10 years after training.
2.3. Measures
The measures are detailed elsewhere [4], with brief descrip-
tions of those relevant to analyses provided here. The memory
composite outcome included Hopkins Verbal Learning Test,
Rey Auditory-Verbal Learning Test, and Rivermead Behav-
ioral Memory Test (immediate recall). The reasoning compos-
ite included Letter Series, Letter Sets, and Word Series. The
speed composite included the four subtests of the Useful Field
of View, reverse-scaled so that higher scores indicated better
performance. Participants’ vocabulary scores were also consid-
ered. Test scores were normalized to the control group to form
Z-scores. The average of the component Z-scores formed four
domain-specific cognitive composites.
Baseline demographic and health variables were captured
by self-report including age; sex; race; education; marital
status; smoking; alcohol consumption; depressive symptoms
(assessed by the Center for Epidemiological Scales for
Depression); and the presence of diabetes, myocardial
infarction, angina, congestive heart failure (CHF), stroke,
hypertension, and high cholesterol.
2.4. Outcome
Adapting our earlier approach [8] and consistent with
research-based diagnostic criteria [11], we defined dementia
as the first occurrence of any of the following:
1. Cognitive and functional impairment defined as fol-
lows: a) memory composite score at or below 21.5
SD of the baseline sample mean and reasoning compos-
ite, speed composite, or vocabulary score at or below
21.5 SD of the baseline mean (for assessment details
see [4]), and b) MDS IADL total score at or below
the 10th percentile of the baseline (self-reported).
2. A score of ,22 on the MMSE, with all subsequent
MMSE assessments at ,22 or missing [12].
3. Self- or proxy-report of diagnosis of dementia or Alz-
heimer’s disease during the follow-up.
Our earlier approach [8] included two additional criteria,
institutionalization and deactivation due to family refusal.
We did not include these two criteria in the primary analysis
because neither designation is specific to dementia. Demen-
tia is the cause of nursing home placement in only 48% of
admissions [13], and families may restrict participant
engagement for reasons apart from dementia. For compara-
bility to earlier analyses, we included these two markers in
sensitivity analyses (Section 2.5.1).
2.5. Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using SAS 9.4 soft-
ware. Descriptive statistics are presented using means and
standard deviations for continuous variables and frequencies
and proportions for categorical variables. The effect of
cognitive training on dementia risk was evaluated using Wei-
bull regression analyses for interval-censored data, as
markers of dementia were only known within discrete inter-
vals of time. Accelerated failure time analysis using Weibull
regression model was used to estimate training effects while
controlling for confounding effects of potential risk factors
[14]. We determined whether randomization to cognitive
training lowered dementia risk by comparing each of the
training groups to the control arm. Second, we examined
whether there was a relationship between dementia and
number of sessions attended for each training arm. Training
sessions ranged from 0 to 18 and were treated as a time-
varying covariate in the model. The approach proposed by
Sparling et al. [15] was used to handle the time-varying co-
variate for interval-censored data.
Unadjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of risk factors were first
estimated, and those significant at the .05 level were then
included in a multivariable model via a backward elimina-
tion procedure. Adjusted HRs and their 95% confidence in-
tervals (CIs) were estimated based on the final model to
assess the effect of these factors on dementia risk.
2.5.1. Sensitivity analyses
Sensitivity analyses were performed to examine the effect
of variations in dementia criteria. Training effects were esti-
mated using different combinations of the criteria (Section
2.4) including #1, #2, and #3; #1 only, #2 only, and #3
only; and #1 and #2, #1 and #3, and #2 and #3. In addition,
we examined the dementia criteria previously applied [8],
which included institutionalization and deactivation from
the study due to family refusal. These results were compared
with the primary results to examine whether the effects were
dependent on the dementia definition.
To further evaluate the effect of training sessions at-
tended, three sets of sensitivity analyses were performed.
The first set examined the effect of dementia criteria on
the relation between number of sessions attended and de-
mentia risk as detailed above.
The second set of sensitivity analyses for the effect of
training sessions attended examined whether unmeasured
participant characteristics associated with invitation to
booster training may account for the relation between
training sessions and dementia risk as there could be differ-
ences between participants who completed fewer/more
training sessions. Restricting the analysis to two subgroups
of more homogeneous participants, who initially completed
at least eight sessions of training and were or were not ran-
domized to booster training, we examined the adjusted effect
of training sessions on dementia risk and compared results to
the primary analysis. The goal was to determine whether the
relation between training and dementia risk was evident in
these two subgroups of participants.
The third set of sensitivity analyses examined the effect of
different patterns of attrition on the relation between training

s & Dementia: Translational Research & Clinical Interventions 3 (2017) 603-611
605
 sessions and dementia risk. Utilizing the ideas of pattern
mixture models, we restricted the analysis to three sub-
groups of participants by dropout patterns: early dropouts
(those who dropped out of the study before 5 years), late
dropouts (those who dropped out of the study after 5 years),
and completers (those who remained in the study at
10 years). The adjusted effect of training sessions on demen-
tia risk was estimated and compared to the primary analysis
to determine whether the relation between training sessions
and dementia risk was of similar magnitude in these three
subgroups of participants.
3. Results
3.1. Demographics
Demographics, health characteristics, and attrition were
similar by training arm (ps . .05, see Table 1). At baseline,
the overall sample had an average age of 73.6 years (SD 5.9),
preserved cognitive status as indicated by MMSE (M 27.3,
SD 2.0), and included individuals who were predominately
white (73.3%) and female (76.2%). Each training arm had
comparable rates of health conditions including diabetes,
hypertension, myocardial infarction, stroke, and depressive
symptoms. The total number of training sessions attended,
including the initial and booster sessions, were not different
across treatment arms. Of the 2785 participants in the ana-
lytic sample, 1220 completed the 10-year follow-up. Among
participants who did not complete the 10-year follow-up,
627 were censored due to death, and the remaining 938
were censored prior to the 10-year follow-up due to attrition
(30.6% attrition). The rate of nonparticipation due to death,
withdrawal, and loss to follow-up was in expected ranges
given the age of the sample at baseline, and, importantly,
did not differ by training arm.
3.2. Characteristics of participants with dementia
A total of 260 participants developed dementia during the
10-year follow-up (12% met the psychometric criteria for de-
mentia only, 28% met the MMSE criterion for dementia only,
43% met the reported diagnosis of dementia criterion only,
15% met two of the definitions, and 2% met all three of the
definitions). Participants who developed dementia during
the follow-up were older, male, of nonwhite race, less
educated, more likely nondrinkers, with more depressive
symptoms, and more likely to have diabetes or CHF (Table 2).
3.3. Cognitive training and number of sessions attended
Speed training resulted in lower risk of dementia across
10 years as compared to control (see Table 3). The hazard
of dementia was 29% lower for speed training than control
(HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.50–0.998, P 5 .049). The risk of

 dementia for memory and reasoning training was not signif-
icantly different compared to control (see Table 3). A greater
number of memory sessions was associated with reduced de-
mentia risk (HR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.90–1.00, P 5.038) but was
not significant after adjusting for risk factors. The lower risk
of dementia for speed training was more prominent for those
who completed a greater number of training sessions
(Table 3). Each additional speed training session was associ-
ated with a 10% lower hazard for dementia (unadjusted HR,
0.90, 95% CI, 0.85–0.95, P ,.001). The effect of number of
speed training sessions remained significant after controlling
for age, sex, race, depressive symptoms, diabetes, and
congestive heart failure (adjusted HR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.85–
0.95, P , .001). Among participants who completed five
or more booster training sessions, indicators of dementia
were evident in 5.9% of participants from the speed arm
and 9.7–10.1% among those completing the memory and
reasoning
booster
training
arms,
respectively
(See
Supplemental Table 1).
3.4. Sensitivity analyses for effects of cognitive training
When dementia was defined using all three criteria (Sec-
tion 2.4) in all combinations and more broadly also using the
previously applied [8] criteria (i.e., institutionalization and
deactivation due to family refusal), the hazard of dementia
was consistently lower for participants in the speed training
arm compared to controls. The estimated HR ranged from
0.64 to 0.87, magnitudes consistent with the results from
the primary analyses (Supplemental Table 2).
3.5. Sensitivity analyses for effect of training sessions
3.5.1. Variations in dementia definition
For the effect of training sessions, the estimated HRs of
dementia were again consistent with the primary analysis
when dementia was defined using different combinations
of the criteria. The estimated HRs after adjusting for age,
sex, race, depressive symptoms, and diabetes ranged from
0.90 to 0.92 (Supplemental Table 3), indicating that a greater
number of speed of processing training was associated with
lower dementia risk.

 3.5.2. Assignment to booster
Among 639 participants in the speed training arm who
completed at least 8 initial training sessions (hence eligible
for booster training), an additional training session was asso-
ciated with an 11% lower risk of dementia (adjusted HR, 0.89;
95% CI, 0.82–0.98). Similarly, the adjusted HR was 0.83
(95% CI, 0.74–0.92) for an additional training session among
365 participants in the speed training arm who completed at
least 8 initial training sessions and were randomized to
booster training. These results are consistent with the primary
analyses. That is, when two relatively homogeneous sub-
groups (8–10 initial sessions attended, 8–10 initial sessions at-
tended and randomized to booster) were selected from the
speed training arm, we still see the same trend for decreased
risk of dementia with increased training session exposure.
3.5.3. Patterns of attrition
The three dropout patterns (prior to 5-year follow-up, af-
ter 5-year follow-up, and completers) had HRs of similar
magnitude as found in the primary analysis. The HRs for
each additional training session were 0.89 for early dropouts,
0.94 for late dropouts, and 0.89 for completers. Although the
statistical significance was not consistent as in the primary
analysis (due to limited power from small subsamples), re-
sults for dropout patterns yielded effect sizes similar in
magnitude indicating lower risk of dementia associated
with attending more speed training sessions.
4. Discussion
Initially healthy, well-functioning older adults randomized
to speed of processing cognitive training had a 29% reduction
in their risk of dementia after 10 years of follow-up compared
to an untreated control group. This relationship seemed to be
driven in part by number of training sessions attended (greater
risk reduction with more training sessions attended). Cogni-
tive training focused on memory or reasoning was not associ-
ated with decreased risk of dementia. To our knowledge, this
is the first study to show that any intervention (behavioral or
pharmacologic) can lower risk of dementia.
This relationship was not detectable in the ACTIVE sam-
ple after 5 years of follow-up [8]. At 5 years, there were 189
dementia cases compared to 260 cases at 10 years. The
increased number of outcomes improved our power to detect
a relationship. We also applied new analysis by examining
the role of number of training sessions attended, and found
that is an important driver of the effect.
Speed training is distinct from memory and reasoning
training as a perceptual/cognitive technique aimed at
enhancing basic information processing efficiency with im-
plicit learning mechanisms. In contrast, the memory and
reasoning training arms are strategy-based and operate
through explicit memory systems. Older adults at higher
risk for dementia due to older age, low education, or mild
cognitive impairment are actually more likely to benefit
from speed training [9,16,17]. Meta-analysis of speed training
indicates effects are broad [18] including enhanced quality of
life [19,20], lower risk of depression [21], and improved phys-
ical function [22]. Importantly, multiple randomized trials
indicate that speed training results in improved everyday
functioning including both performance-based and self-
report indices of IADL [17,23–26]. Given that functional
decline is a hallmark of dementia [27], it is logical that speed
training reduces dementia risk. A recent critique of cognitive
training in general is that participants’ beliefs and expecta-
tions may influence their performance [28]. However, results
across randomized trials indicate that speed of processing
training produces equivalent training gains as compared to
either active control conditions or no-contact controls and
that speed training effects cannot be attributed to beliefs or ex-
pectations [18,29,30].
To place our results in a broader context, the dementia
risk reduction of 22.7% for speed training vs. 28.8% for con-
trol yields a relative risk of 78.8% across 10 years. The
magnitude of this effect is greater than the relative risk
reduction antihypertensive medications provide against ma-
jor cardiovascular events like stroke, coronary heart disease,
or heart failure, in which treatment is associated with a 20–
40% relative risk reduction over 3 to 5 years [31].
The underlying mechanism for the dementia risk reduction
is not yet clear but could relate to positive changes in brain
reserve as a result of cognitive training [32]. The brain reserve
concept arose, in part, as a way to understand the well-
documented protective effect of education on the display of
clinical brain diseases in epidemiological studies. Speed
training may lower dementia risk by increasing brain reserve
capacity through compensatory changes in function (e.g.,
enhanced capacity or efficiency of the brain) or via direct effects
promoting viability of healthy tissue or decreasing the amount
or effect of pathologic proteins and processes [8,33]. Biomarker
studies or changes in brain structure and function taken at
intervals during training may help identify mechanisms of
action underlying the protective effects of speed training.
This study includes strengths such as the experimental
design, a large diverse sample, multi-center treatment delivery
and outcome assessments, and longitudinal follow-up. Limita-
tions are also noted including the absence of a clinical diag-
nosis, attrition during follow-up, and the method of booster
training assignment. ACTIVE did not have dementia as a pri-
mary outcome, so results are from secondary analyses. We
acknowledge that the association between number of training
sessions and the risk for dementia could be due to reverse cau-
sality. As such, we have appropriately moderated the interpre-
tation of the exposure to training results toward association
with risk. Our dementia criteria were defined a priori [8]. There
are of course limitations to these criteria, for example, self- and
proxy-reports of dementia diagnosis are not infallible, MDS-
IADL function was self-reported and thus biased, low
MMSE is not a sensitive dementia marker, and overlap among
the dementia criteria was low. A definitive study of the efficacy
of cognitive training on dementia requires a clinical diagnosis
as the primary outcome. That said, our approach to
J.D. Edwards et al. / Alzheimer’
s & Dementia: Translational Research & Clinical Interventions 3 (2017) 603-611
608
 approximating a clinical diagnosis of dementia is reasonable
and yielded a similar proportion of cases with dementia as prior
research [1]. Our criteria were based on standard diagnostic
criteria and published quantitative cut points. The psychometric
criteria tie directly to the definition of dementia from the Na-
tional Institute on Aging/Alzheimer’s Association-loss of
cognitive function associated with impairment in activities of
daily living [34]. Furthermore, results confirmed that known
risk factors for dementia (e.g., age, education, CHF, and dia-
betes) were similarly associated with our dementia criteria
[35,36]. Finally, sensitivity analyses systematically examined
variations in the dementia definition and found effects of
similar magnitude with every variant.
Attrition always presents a challenge when the sample
comprises adults over age 65, and the follow-up interval is
long. Typically, such studies see attrition rates of 2.5–9%
per year [37–39]. The overall attrition rate in ACTIVE of
5.5% per year over a 10-year-period falls within this range.
Importantly, in ACTIVE, there was no differential attrition
by training arm, either quantitatively or by reason for
participant loss. Finally, our sensitivity analyses comparing
effects of early dropout, late dropouts, and completers
consistently indicated similar magnitude of speed training
effects on dementia risk reduction regardless of timing of
dropout. Thus, the results are robust and are likely a valid
indication of the influence of speed training on dementia.
A design limitation in ACTIVE was the method of assign-
ing participants to booster training after the initial training
was completed. Participants were randomized to booster,
but invitation to complete booster was conditioned on initial
training adherence. While this helps to assure delivery of the
treatment, it also opens the range of interpretation of booster
effects. One of the sensitivity analyses we conducted exam-
ined if participant factors related to completing 81 initial
sessions and hence being eligible for booster training could
explain the dementia risk reduction. The relation of
increased training exposure to lower risk of dementia was
detected in each group to the same degree; therefore, differ-
ential participant characteristics linked to booster assign-
ment is likely not responsible for our pattern of findings.
We have shown that a specific form of cognitive training,
speed of processing, reduced the risk of dementia in initially
well-functioning older adults followed up to 10 years. This is
the first report of an intervention significantly reducing de-
mentia risk. Future research should examine ways to in-
crease the potency of this form of training intrinsically
(e.g., increasing dose) and possibly by adding other putative
protective interventions (e.g., exercise and diet). Replication
of results using clinical diagnosis of dementia as a primary
outcome is needed. Further examination to elucidate mech-
anisms of action is also warranted.

RESEARCH IN CONTEXT
1. Systematic review: We conducted systematic litera-
ture reviews in Pubmed and PsychInfo to identify
randomized clinical trials of cognitive training
among healthy older adults. The Advanced Cognitive
Trial in Vital Elderly is the only randomized clinical
trial to examine the effects of cognitive training on
dementia risk.
2. Interpretation: Our results indicate that cognitive
speed of processing training, a computerized tech-
nique aimed at improving useful field of view, signif-
icantly reduced dementia risk across 10 years.
Multiple clinical trials indicate that speed training
improves older adults’ everyday function. As func-
tional decline is a hallmark of dementia, it is consis-
tent that speed training reduces dementia risk. We
provide new evidence that certain nonpharmacologi-
cal, cognitive interventions (i.e., speed of processing
training) have potential to reduce dementia risk and
improve public health.
3. Future directions: Future work should clarify the
mechanisms of effective cognitive training and deter-
mine the dose required to derive health benefits.
