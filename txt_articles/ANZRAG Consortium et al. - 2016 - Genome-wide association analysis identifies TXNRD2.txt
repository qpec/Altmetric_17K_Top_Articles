Abstract
Primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) is a leading cause of blindness world-wide. To identify new 
susceptibility loci, we meta-analyzed GWAS results from 8 independent studies from the United 
States (3,853 cases and 33,480 controls) and investigated the most significant SNPs in two 
Australian studies (1,252 cases and 2,592 controls), 3 European studies (875 cases and 4,107 
controls) and a Singaporean Chinese study (1,037 cases and 2,543 controls). A meta-analysis of 
top SNPs identified three novel loci: rs35934224[T] within TXNRD2 (odds ratio (OR) = 0.78, P = 
4.05×10−11 encoding a mitochondrial protein required for redox homeostasis; rs7137828[T] 
within ATXN2 (OR = 1.17, P = 8.73×10−10), and rs2745572[A] upstream of FOXC1 (OR = 1.17, 
P = 1.76×10−10). Using RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry, we show TXNRD2 and ATXN2 
expression in retinal ganglion cells and the optic nerve head. These results identify new pathways 
underlying POAG susceptibility and suggest novel targets for preventative therapies.
Glaucoma is a clinically and genetically complex disease that is the leading cause of 
irreversible blindness worldwide1,2. Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), the most 
common form of the disease in most populations3, is characterized by retinal ganglion cell 
apoptosis and progressive optic nerve damage4. While recent genome-wide association 
studies (GWAS) have identified interesting POAG risk loci5–9, these account for only a 
fraction of disease heritability. To identify new POAG loci, we have completed a meta-
analysis of GWAS summary findings of individuals of European descent from the United 
States with replication in an Australian study (ANZRAG) and further evaluation in a second 
Australian study (BMES), 3 European studies and a Singaporean Chinese dataset.

 For stage 1 (discovery) we meta-analyzed summary data from 8 independent datasets (3,853 
cases and 33,480 controls; Supplementary Table 1) with European ancestry from the United 
States collectively referred to as the National Eye Institute Glaucoma Human Genetics 
Collaboration Heritable Overall Operational Database (NEIGHBORHOOD). For all 8 
NEIGHBORHOOD studies cases were primarily defined as at least 1 reliable visual field 
showing loss consistent with glaucoma, without a secondary cause, or CDR (cup-to-disc 
ratio) ≥ 0.7 or CDR asymmetry ≥ 0.2 or documented progression of optic nerve degeneration 
(in the Ocular Hypertension Treatment Study [OHTS])10. Controls had CDR <0.7. 
Additionally, for all datasets except OHTS, controls had intraocular pressure (IOP) of < 21 
mmHg (Supplementary Table 2). For each dataset, site-specific quality control (sample and 
genotype call rates ≥ 95%), principal components analysis (EIGENSTRAT11), and 
imputation (IMPUTE212 or MACH13,14) were completed using the 1000 Genomes Project 
reference panel (March 2012) (Supplementary Note, Supplementary Table 3). Imputed 
variants with minor allele frequencies <5% or imputation quality scores (r2) <0.7 were 
removed prior to analysis. Dosage data, in the form of estimated genotypic probabilities, 
were analyzed in ProbABEL15 for each dataset using logistic regression models, adjusting 
for age, sex, any significant eigenvectors and study-specific covariates. Genomic inflation 
was less than 1.05 (λ-value) for each individual dataset (Supplementary Figure 1). Estimated 
genotypic probabilities for 6,425,680 variants were meta-analyzed in METAL16 using the 
inverse variance weighted method. To confirm that the results were not skewed by a 
particular dataset we completed a sensitivity analysis by selectively removing each dataset 
and meta-analyzing the remaining 7. The ORs from each grouping of 7 datasets were highly 
correlated with the results obtained from all 8 datasets (Supplementary Figure 2).
The stage 1 genome-wide association results are shown in Supplementary Figure 3, and the 
association results for all SNPs with P < 1×10−5 are shown in Supplementary Table 4. One 
SNP (rs2745572[A]) located in a novel region on 6p 50Kb 5′ of FOXC1 reached genome-
wide significance (OR = 1.25, P = 2.36×10−9) in stage 1 (Table 1). Additionally, 873 SNPs 
including SNPs located in regions not previously associated with POAG on 1p, 2p, 2q, 5p, 
6p, 6q, 10q, 12q, 20p, and 22p had P< 1×10−5 (Supplementary Table 4).
Next we investigated the associations of the most significant stage 1 SNPs (P< 1×10−5) in a 
replication dataset of European Caucasians from Australia (ANZRAG, Australian and New 
Zealand Registry of Advanced Glaucoma; 1,155 cases and 1,992 controls) (Supplementary 
Note), and performed a meta-analysis of these SNPs in the NEIGHBORHOOD and 
ANZRAG datasets using the effect sizes and their standard errors (stage 2). In the meta-
analysis, SNPs in novel regions 50kb 5′ of FOXC1 [top SNP rs2745572[[A], OR = 1.23, P = 
6.5×10−11], within intron 14 of ATXN2 [top SNP rs7137828 [T], OR = 1.18, P = 9.2×10−9] 
and within intron 11 of TXNRD2 [top SNP rs35934224[T], OR = 0.77, P = 1.8×10−9] 
reached genome-wide significance (Table 1, Supplementary Table 5). The regional 
association results for these SNPs are shown in Figure 1.
For each of the 3 novel regions reaching genome-wide significance after stage 2, we further 
examined their association with POAG in: a second Australian dataset (BMES, Blue 
Mountains Eye Study) (107 cases and 600 controls); 3 European datasets (875 cases and 
4,107 controls in total); and a study of Singaporean Chinese (1,037 cases and 2,543

 controls); (stage 3). Meta-analysis of all datasets exceeded genome-wide significance for all 
three top SNPs (Figure 2, Supplementary Figure 4): TXNRD2 rs35934224[T], combined P 
= 4.05×10−11, OR = 0.78; ATXN2 rs7137828[T], combined P = 4.40×10−10, OR = 1.17; and 
FOXC1 rs2745572[A], combined P = 1.76×10−10, OR = 1.17 (Supplementary Tables 6 and 
7). The ATXN2 top SNP (rs7137828) is very rare in the Singaporean Chinese population 
and thus could not be evaluated.
SNPs in the GAS7 region, previously associated with intraocular pressure (IOP), a 
quantitative trait that, when elevated, is a risk factor for glaucoma17–19, were significantly 
associated with POAG after stage 2 (top SNP rs9897123[T], OR = 0.83, P = 5.85×10−10) 
(Table 1). Other POAG loci identified in recent studies5–9 were also confirmed, including 
TMCO1, CDKN2BAS, SIX6, ABCA1, and AFAP1 (Table 1, Supplementary Table 8). 
PMM2 SNPs recently identified in Chinese POAG9 were nominally associated with POAG 
(top SNP rs12444233[T], OR = 1.13, P = 0.0016).
POAG, like many complex human diseases, displays clinical sub-phenotypes20,21. In 
particular, optic nerve degeneration in POAG can occur without elevation of IOP, a clinical 
subtype defined as normal-tension glaucoma (NTG)22. The NEIGHBORHOOD POAG 
dataset included 725 NTG cases (maximum IOP ≤ 21 mm Hg) and 1,868 high tension 
glaucoma (HTG) (maximum IOP > 21 mm Hg) cases (pretreatment IOP was not available 
for 1260 cases). The meta-analysis of NTG cases (using all the controls from the datasets 
with NTG cases) revealed one novel locus on chromosome 12q (rs2041895 [C], OR= 1.48, P 
= 2.41×10−8) in stage 1 (Supplementary Figure 5, Supplementary Table 9). The direction of 
effect was consistent (OR=1.15) in the ANZRAG NTG dataset, but did not reach 
significance (P=0.11) and the combined association result (NEIGHBORHOOD + 
ANZRAG) fell just short of genome-wide significance (P= 8.01×10−8), possibly due to a 
smaller number of NTG cases in the ANZRAG dataset (N=363). In the NEIGHBORHOOD 
discovery dataset we confirmed previous NTG associations on 9p7 (CDKN2BAS top SNP 
rs1333037[T], OR = 1.67, P=1.35×10−12) and 8q227 (top SNP, rs284491[T], OR = 0.66, 
P=2.30×10−8) and in the HTG subgroup, (1,868 cases) confirmed associations with 
TMCO16,17, and SIX67,23 (Supplementary Figure 6, Supplementary Table 10). The FOXC1 
region SNPs associated with POAG overall were also significant in the NEIGHBORHOOD 
HTG subgroup (most significant SNP rs2317961, OR =0.76, P = 2.58×10−8).
To assess the possible functional effects of SNPs at the three newly identified POAG loci, 
we accessed and applied data from ENCODE24, SCAN (eQTL)25, GENEVAR (eQTL)26, 
GTEx (eQTL)27 and RegulomeDBv228,29. After stage 2, seven SNPs reached genome-wide 
significance in the FOXC1 region (Supplementary Table 5) and all seven of these are located 
50Kb 5′ to FOXC1 in a region annotated by ENCODE as regulatory (Supplementary Figure 
7) and are associated with enhancers in several cell types (P=0.01, RegulomeDBv2). The 
most significant SNP (rs2745572) is evolutionarily conserved (GERP = 1.8) and alters a 
Barhl1 transcription factor binding site (RegulomeDBv2). In zebrafish Barhl1 is expressed 
in distinct retinal cell lineages and is differentially regulated by Atoh730, a retinal-specific 
transcription factor that has been previously associated with optic nerve area31 and 
glaucoma32. In the NEIGHBORHOOD meta-analysis we found nominal evidence for 
association with ATOH7 and POAG (top SNP rs1867567[A] P = 0.042, OR, 1.07).

 Four SNPs in the ATXN2 region were significantly associated with POAG after stage 2 
(Supplementary Table 5). These SNPs are located in genomic regions enriched for enhancers 
(P = 0.01) in lymphoid cells (RegulomeDBv2). The most significant SNP (rs7137828) is 
located in a SP1 transcription factor binding site, and another associated SNP, rs653178 
which is in linkage disequilibrium with rs7137828 (R2>0.8, Caucasian European Ancestry) 
is located in an Esr2 (Estrogen receptor 2) binding site. Both SP1 and Esr2 are expressed in 
retinal cells33, 34 and could influence expression of ATXN235.
The TXNRD2 region that includes 22 associated SNPs at the genome-wide level after stage 
2 (Supplementary Table 5) is significantly enriched for enhancers (P=1×10−6, 
RegulomeDBv2) and DNaseI hypersensitivity sites (P = 4.3×10−5, RegulomeDBv2) in 
multiple cell types. Additionally, 6 of the TXNRD2 SNPs are cis eQTLs significantly 
affecting TXNRD2 transcript levels in MuTHer (Multiple Tissue Human Expression 
Resource) Twins36 in lymphoblasts and skin (P=1×10−8, GENEVAR; Supplementary Figure 
8). The top SNP (rs35934224) is also an eQTL in skin using RNA seq and 1000 Genomes 
imputation (P=2.32×10−13)37. All 22 TXNRD2 SNPs are significant cis eQTLs (P<1×10−4) 
in the GTEx database27 in thyroid tissue and 19 are significant eQTLs in tibial nerve tissue 
(Supplementary Figure 9). The most significant TXNRD2 SNP (rs35934224) is located in a 
binding site for NRSF (neuron-restrictive silencer factor, also known as REST, (repressor 
element 1-silencing transcription factor), a transcription factor that potently protects neurons 
from oxidative stress38.
FOXC1 is a member of the forkhead family of transcription factors and rare coding 
sequence mutations (missense, nonsense, and CNVs) are known to cause anterior segment 
dysgenesis and early-onset glaucoma with dominant inheritance39,40. FOXC1 has not been 
previously implicated in common adult-onset forms of glaucoma including POAG or HTG. 
Interestingly, association over GMDS, located 3′ to FOXC1, has been identified in a study 
using some of the same samples used here8. In our study we found genome-wide significant 
association adjacent to FOXC1 in the 5′ regulatory region and less significant association in 
GMDS (top SNP rs9378638, OR = 0.83, P = 7.50×10−6). The top SNPs in the two regions 
are approximately 400kb apart and are not in linkage disequilibrium. Conditional analysis 
confirmed that the odds ratio and P-value for the significantly associated SNPs 5′ to FOXC1 
are unchanged by conditioning on the GMDS peak SNP, suggesting that these are 
independent associations (Supplementary Figure 10). The 5′ regulatory SNPs associated 
with POAG and HTG identified by this study could be involved in regulation of FOXC1 
expression.
The ATXN2 and TXNRD2 genomic regions have not been previously associated with 
POAG or with any glaucoma-related quantitative traits such as optic nerve parameters or 
IOP. Expansions of an ATXN2 CAG repeat can cause spinocerebellar ataxia 2 with optic 
atrophy and intermediate expansions can contribute to development of amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis (ALS)41. Interestingly, very recently two other genes known to be responsible for 
Mendelian forms of NTG have also been shown to contribute to ALS (amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis)42,43. The ATXN2-SH3 region has been associated with retinal venular caliber in 
Caucasians with European ancestry44. We analyzed the expression of ATXN2 mRNA in 
normal human ocular tissues by RT-PCR and found expression in the cornea, trabecular

 meshwork, ciliary body, retina and optic nerve (Supplementary Figure 11). Immuno-labeling 
of sections of a normal mouse eye showed evidence of Atxn2 in the retinal ganglion cells 
and optic nerve (Figure 3).
TXNRD2 codes for thioredoxin reductase 2, a mitochondrial protein necessary for reducing 
damaging reactive oxygen species generated by oxidative phosphorylation and other 
mitochondrial functions45. Cellular oxidative stress has been hypothesized as a cause of 
retinal ganglion cell dysfunction in glaucoma46 and over-expression of thioredoxin 2, the 
substrate of thioredoxin reductase 2 (encoded by TXNRD2), increased retinal ganglion cell 
survival in an experimental glaucoma model47. We confirmed by RT-PCR that TXNRD2 is 
expressed in normal human ocular tissue (Supplementary Figure 11) including the retina and 
optic nerve. Immuno-labeling in mice showed strong staining in retinal ganglion cells as 
well as in the optic nerve (Figure 3). These data suggest that reduction of reactive oxygen 
species by TXNRD2 could prevent mitochondrial dysfunction and retinal ganglion cell 
apoptosis in glaucoma. TXNRD2 is the first mitochondrial protein associated with glaucoma 
risk.
In this study, common variants near FOXC1, ATXN2 and TXNRD2 were identified as new 
risk loci for POAG. These genes suggest novel pathways that may contribute to glaucoma 
development including abnormal ocular development (FOXC1), neuro-degeneration 
(ATXN2) and mitochondrial dysfunction secondary to accumulating reactive oxygen species 
(TXNRD2). Targeting these pathways could lead to effective and potentially preventative 
glaucoma therapies.

Online Methods
Study design
Imputed genotypes (1000 Genomes panel, March 2012) for 3,853 cases and 33,480 controls 
from 8 independent datasets were used as the discovery cohort for this genome-wide 
association study for Primary Open Angle Glaucoma (POAG) (stage 1). The association 
results for the top SNPs from the discovery cohort were replicated in 1,155 cases and 1,992 
controls from an Australian POAG study of Caucasians of European ancestry (stage 2) 
followed by further replication (stage 3) in a second Australian study, BMES (Blue 
Mountains Eye Study) and 3 European studies (EPIC (European Prospective Investigation 
into Cancer-Norfolk Eye Study), GER (Germany), UK (United Kingdom); (982 cases and 
4,707 controls total), and a Singaporean Chinese datasest of 1,037 cases and 2,543 controls. 
The details for all datasets including genotyping platforms, quality control, imputation 
methods and diagnostic criteria are listed in the Supplementary Notes.
Meta-analysis (Discovery, stage 1)
Quality-control was performed for each data set as described in the Supplementary Note. 
Overall sample and genotype call rates were ≥ 95% for each site. Samples with Log R ratio 
(LRR) and B allele frequency (BAF) values suggestive of copy number variants were 
removed prior to analysis. Principal components (eigenvectors) were computed for all 
participants using EIGENSTRAT11. For each dataset logistic regression was performed in 
ProbABEL15 for all analyses (POAG overall, HTG, NTG), controlling for age, sex, and 
study-specific covariates including study-specific eigenvectors. Each analysis was evaluated 
separately for overall genomic inflation (implementing the R package GenABEL) (λ-value ≤ 
1.05 for each dataset) (Supplementary Figure 1). Results were meta-analyzed in METAL16 
implementing the inverse variance weighted method and applying genomic control 
correction.
Replication (Stage 2 and 3)
Loci of interest in the discovery cohort (NEIGHBORHOOD; P<1×10−5) were evaluated in 
the first replication cohort (ANZRAG) and meta-analyzed with the NEIGHBORHOOD 
results (stage 2). The top SNPs for the three novel regions were evaluated in 5 additional 
datasets, one Australian (BMES), 3 European (EPIC, GER, UK) and a Singaporean Chinese 
dataset.
Power calculations
Power calculations were done as described48. For the stage 1 discovery analysis, power 
calculations using disease prevalence of 2%49 indicated that there was 96% power of 
detecting loci at P < 1.0 × 10−5 (the threshold for carrying over to stage 2) at minor allele 
frequencies as low as 30% with per-allele odds ratios of 1.17. The entire sample set (stages

 1, 2 and 3) had 99% power to detect loci at P < 5.0 × 10−8 at minor allele frequencies as low 
as 30% with per-allele odds ratios as low as 1.17.
Candidate genes and functional effects
Genes of interest in the associated region were identified using Ensembl50, UCSC genome 
Bioinformatics51, and Genecards52. To predict functional effects of the top POAG associated 
SNPs, we used the ENCODE project data24, HaploReg v228 and RegulomeDB29. We used 
SCAN25, Genevar26 and GTEx27 and a study of UK twins using RNA seq and 1000 
genomes imputation37 to investigate expression quantitative trait loci within genomic 
regions of interest.
Statistical analyses
Conditional analyses were done using the top SNPs in the FOXC1, ATXN2, and TXNRD2 
regions as well as the top SNP in the previously reported GMDS region8 conditioning on the 
risk allele in the region of interest. Conditional analyses were performed using GCTA 
(Genome Complex Trait Analysis)53.
Forest plots to visualize the effect sizes of top SNPs in each region by dataset were created 
using the rmeta package in R. The odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for each 
displayed SNP were plotted and the P-values listed for each analysis (Figure 2) and each 
NEIGHBORHOOD dataset (Supplementary Figure 4).
Sensitivity analysis using the leave-one-out method was done by excluding each 
NEIGHBORHOOD dataset from a meta-analysis of the other 7 datasets. We compared the 
odds ratios from these analyses by calculating the Pearson’s product-moment correlation 
coefficient between each leave-one-out analysis and the overall meta-analysis of eight 
NEIGHBORHOOD datasets (Stage 1), as shown in Supplementary Figure 2. Correlations 
were calculated in R using the corrplot package and ellipse option.
Expression analysis of genes at associated loci in ocular tissues
Total RNA was extracted from dissected tissues from normal human donor eyes as 
previously described54,55 using an RNA isolation kit from Life Technologies (Carlsbad, CA, 
USA). Reverse Transcriptional reactions were completed using SuperScript III reverse 
transcriptase from Life Technologies. Primer sequences were designed to specifically 
amplify TXNRD2 and ATXN2. PCR reactions were performed using the recommended 
conditions with Platinum Taq DNA polymerase (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) 
using a Touch Down program. Amplified PCR products were visualized by gel 
electrophoresis with 2% agarose gel.
Immunohistochemistry
C57BL/6J mice (males and females) were maintained on a 12/12 hours light/dark cycle. All 
experiments were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee at The Jackson 
Laboratory. Eyes from 2–4 months old C57BL/6J mice were enucleated and fixed in 4% 
Paraformaldehyde for 2 hours, rinsed in 0.1M Phosphate buffer, immersed in 30% sucrose 
overnight and frozen in OCT. 15 mm sections were placed on Fisherbrand Superfrost Plus

 Slides and stored at −70°C until required. Sections were incubated overnight at 4°C in the 
following primary antibodies: rabbit anti TXNRD2 (1:50 Acris); rabbit anti-ATXN2 (1:50, 
Acris). All antibodies were diluted in PBT (1×PBS, 1% TritonX-100). Sections were 
blocked in 2.5% chicken serum (in PBT) for 1 hour, then incubated overnight at 4oC. After 
primary incubation, sections were washed 3 times in PBT and incubated with the secondary 
antibody (goat anti-rabbit IgG) for 4hrs at 4°C. All sections were then counterstained with 
DAPI and mounted with Aqua PolyMount. Images were collected on a Leica SP5 Confocal 
microscope. For each antibody, at least 3 sections from 6 eyes were assessed. Antibodies 
were obtained from Acris: Ataxin 2, Catalogue number: 21776-1 AP; Immunogen: 
Ag16470; Genebank ID (clone info): BC114546; Purification method: Antifen affinity 
purification; Txnrd2: Catalogue number: 16360-1-AP; Immunogen: Ag8367; Genebank ID 
(clone info): BC007489; Purification method: Antifen affinity purification.
All images in Figure 3 were taken on a Leica SP5 confocal microscope. Images in left and 
center panels were taken with a 20× glycerol objective, right panels were taken with a 63× 
glycerol objective. Excitation was performed using a 405 Diode laser (DAPI) and Argon 
laser (ATXN2 or TXNRD2). Collection was performed using sequential scanning: scan 1 = 
PMT 1 (gain 966) for DAPI, scan 2 = PMT 2 (gain 1013) for ATXN2 or TXNRD2.

 Figure 1. Association results for the regions reaching genome-wide significance after stage 2
These plots show the regional association and recombination rates for the top SNPs in the 
discovery cohort (NEIGHBORHOOD, 3,853 cases and 33,480 controls) after meta-analysis 
with data for these SNPs from ANZRAG (1,155 cases and 1,992 controls). In each plot, the 
solid diamond indicates the top-ranked SNP in the region based on two-sided P values. The 
colored box at the right or left corner of each plot indicates the pairwise correlation (r2) 
between the top SNP and the other SNPs in the region. The blue spikes show the estimated 
recombination rates. The box underneath each plot shows the gene annotations in the region.
