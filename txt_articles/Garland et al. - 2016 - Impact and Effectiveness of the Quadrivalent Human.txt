Prophylactic human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination programs constitute major public health initiatives worldwide. We as-
sessed the global effect of quadrivalent HPV (4vHPV) vaccination on HPV infection and disease. PubMed and Embase were
systematically searched for peer-reviewed articles from January 2007 through February 2016 to identify observational studies
reporting the impact or effectiveness of 4vHPV vaccination on infection, anogenital warts, and cervical cancer or precancerous
lesions. Over the last decade, the impact of HPV vaccination in real-world settings has become increasingly evident, especially
among girls vaccinated before HPV exposure in countries with high vaccine uptake. Maximal reductions of approximately
90% for HPV 6/11/16/18 infection, approximately 90% for genital warts, approximately 45% for low-grade cytological cervical
abnormalities, and approximately 85% for high-grade histologically proven cervical abnormalities have been reported. The full
public health potential of HPV vaccination is not yet realized. HPV-related disease remains a significant source of morbidity
and mortality in developing and developed nations, underscoring the need for HPV vaccination programs with high population
coverage.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the commonest sexually trans-
mitted virus worldwide, with first infection typically occurring
soon after sexual debut. HPV-related diseases cause substantial
morbidity and mortality globally [1]. Cervical cancer is the fourth
most frequent cancer in women, with an estimated 530 000 new
cases in 2012, accounting for 270 000 deaths (7.5% of all female
cancer deaths) [2]. HPV infection causes virtually all cervical can-
cers and high-grade dysplasias, plus approximately 90% of anal,
70% of vaginal, 50% of penile, 40% of vulvar, and 13%–72% of
oropharyngeal cancers [3–13]. The high-risk HPV genotypes 16
and 18 cause approximately 70% of cervical cancers and 80%–
90% of HPV-related neoplasms at other sites, and the low-risk
HPV genotypes 6 and 11 account for 90% of anogenital warts
[3, 5, 8, 14, 15].
Prophylactic HPV vaccines in widespread use include the
bivalent (2vHPV; Cervarix, GSK, Rixensart, Belgium) and
quadrivalent (4vHPV; Gardasil/Silgard, Merck, Kenilworth,
New Jersey) vaccines. A nonavalent (9vHPV; Gardasil 9,
Merck) vaccine has recently been approved in several countries.
All vaccines target HPV 16/18, whereas the 4vHPV vaccine also
targets HPV 6/11 and the 9vHPV vaccine adds 5 oncogenic
types (31/33/45/52/58) [14–17].
The 4vHPV vaccine was first licensed in Gabon in March 2006,
then Mexico, Australia, and the United States in June 2006, fol-
lowed by Europe in September 2006, and is now approved in
129 countries [18]. Although >60 countries include HPV vaccines
in their national immunization programs, coverage rates vary
(Supplementary Table 1). While specific indications differ some-
what by country, the 4vHPV vaccine is widely approved to pre-
vent persistent infection with HPV 6/11/16/18, low- and high-
grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN1 and CIN2/3, respec-
tively), adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS), cervical cancer, high-grade
vaginal and vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VaIN2/3 and VIN2/
3, respectively), vaginal and vulvar cancer, high-grade anal intra-
epithelial neoplasia (AIN2/3), anal cancer, and anogenital warts.
Because vaccination is most protective when administered before
HPV exposure, it is routinely recommended during preadoles-
cence (usually age 11–12 years). Concurrent catch-up vaccination
programs for older ages broaden coverage.
Programmatic implementation differs by country (Supple-
mentary Table 1). An illustration of a pragmatic approach

 quickly translating into impressive reductions in HPV infections
and related diseases due to vaccine types is the ongoing school-
based vaccination program in Australia. This initiative, which
began by temporarily offering free vaccine to females 12–26
years of age, was broadly endorsed and achieved high coverage
of both school-aged girls and the older catch-up age group.
The 4vHPV vaccine was originally tested and approved as a
3-dose regimen, with a dosing schedule of 0, 2, and 6 months.
More recently, a 2-dose schedule (6 or 12 months apart) has
been recommended by the World Health Organization for
younger age groups (eg, 9–14 years old at first dose), because
immunogenicity with 2 doses in preadolescent and early adoles-
cent girls was noninferior to antibody responses in women 16–
26 years of age receiving 3 doses [16].
More than 205 million doses of 4vHPV vaccine had been dis-
tributed worldwide as of 31 December 2015. Although high ef-
ficacy against multiple endpoints was consistently observed in
clinical trials [19], it is essential to document how trial results
translate to real-world settings. Benefits have been described
from various areas of the world subsequent to initiation of
HPV vaccination programs [20]. Vaccine impact first became
apparent for HPV infections and genital warts, which have
short incubation periods following exposure to HPV [21]. Ef-
fects on cervical lesions, which take longer to develop, are
now being documented, starting in Australia where cytological
screening is instituted at a younger age than in most countries.
Cancer rates are expected to decline only in the longer term, be-
cause carcinogenesis after HPV infection may require several
decades to become manifest.
Both vaccine effectiveness and impact aim at evaluating “real-
life benefit” and are typically measured through observational
studies [22] (Supplementary Appendix II). Vaccine effective-
ness corresponds to the proportion of infection or disease pre-
vented among vaccinated individuals, and is estimated by
comparing the incidence in vaccinated vs unvaccinated individ-
uals within similar populations. Vaccine impact denotes the
population-prevented fraction of infection or disease and is as-
sessed by comparing prevalence or incidence in the vaccine era
to a comparable population from the prevaccine era or by mea-
suring population-level trends over time.
This descriptive study coincides with the 10th anniversary of
the 4vHPV vaccine, which is the most widely used HPV vaccine
in many countries around the world. Our systematic review
comprehensively synthesizes available real-world data to quan-
tify the reported effectiveness and impact of 4vHPV vaccination
on HPV infection, anogenital warts, and cervical cytological
and histological abnormalities.
METHODS
PubMed and Embase databases were searched on 29 February
2016 for peer-reviewed manuscripts in any language published
after 1 January 2007 using prespecified search terms
(Supplementary Appendix I) [23, 24]. Observational studies
of effectiveness or impact of 4vHPV vaccination on HPV infec-
tion or disease were considered for inclusion. We also searched
the reference lists of retrieved articles for articles not identified
initially. Studies reporting exclusively on the 2vHPV vaccine, re-
view articles, data only in abstract form, burden-of-disease re-
ports with no vaccine data, health economic modeling/
simulation, and awareness studies were excluded. At least 2 re-
viewers examined articles to confirm inclusion criteria were sat-
isfied
and
to
reach
consensus
when
necessary.
The
heterogeneity of study designs and the individual circumstances
surrounding each study preclude summary estimates; conse-
quently, our review is largely descriptive in nature.
RESULTS
Search Results
After screening 903 articles (Figure 1), 58 publications (6.4%)
reporting the impact or effectiveness of 4vHPV vaccination
on HPV infection, genital warts, and low- and high-grade cer-
vical lesions from 9 countries satisfied the prespecified inclusion
criteria (Table 1). Full citations for these 58 articles [A1–A58]

 females in their teens and 20s (age groups targeted by national
immunization programs). Decreases were highest in younger
birth cohorts, reflecting a lower likelihood of prevalent
HPV infection at time of vaccination. Irrespective of study
design, declines were detected within 4 years after vaccine
availability, even in settings with comparatively low vaccine
coverage.
The effectiveness and impact of 4vHPV vaccination in reduc-
ing HPV-related infection and disease across studies depended
on vaccine coverage in the study population, age of birth

 cohorts for whom vaccination was targeted in each country, im-
plementation and duration of a catch-up program to increase
coverage in older age groups within the indicated age range,
time between program initiation and measurement of impact,
and length of follow-up time covered by the study (Supplemen-
tary Table 3). Consequently, variability in reported findings
more likely reflects operational properties inherent to each
study, rather than fundamental differences in vaccine effective-
ness among populations with otherwise similar baseline charac-
teristics. Despite the many variables involving study design, the
extent of vaccine uptake in the population under study, the
quality of the research, and coexistent circumstances, the gene-
ral findings were remarkably consistent across studies.
Reductions in HPV 6/11/16/18 Infection Prevalence
Within 6 years of 4vHPV vaccination availability, prevalent
HPV 6/11/16/18 infections among Australian women 18–24
years of age decreased by 86% after 3 doses and by 76% after
≥1 dose, compared with contemporaneous unvaccinated
women [A5, A8] (Figure 2A). In the United States, similar re-
ductions (89%) within 6 years were reported in nationally rep-
resentative samples of sexually active females aged 14–24 years
who received ≥1 dose, in comparison to unvaccinated females
in the vaccine era [A7]. In both countries, reductions were also
reported when infection prevalence in vaccinated females was
compared with the prevaccine era [A5, A7, A8] (Figure 2B). Ad-
ditionally, Australia and the United States reported decreased
infection prevalence among unvaccinated females in the vaccine
era compared to the prevaccine era, evidence potentially reflect-
ing herd protection (17%–49%).
Prevalent HPV 16/18 infections declined approximately 75%–
80% among females aged ≤25 years in Australia in the vaccine
era, in comparison to the prevaccine era [A5, A8], similar to sev-
eral studies of US teenagers (62%–88%) [A1, A7] (Figure 2C).
Among American women in their 20s, declines of 26%–56%
were reported for prevalent HPV 16 and 18 infections [A7,
A10], similar to declines (approximately 35%–45%) reported
for females aged 13–22 years in Sweden [A13], 20–25 years in
Germany [A2], and 15–19 years in Belgium [A14]. Smaller de-
clines in prevalent HPV 16 and 18 infections (14%) were
found among women 20–24 years of age in Belgium [A14].
Prevalent HPV 6/11 infections decreased approximately
75%–88% in Australian females ≤25 years old [A5, A8],
70%–80% in American teenagers [A3, A7], and 40%–50% in
American women in their 20s in the vaccine era, in comparison
to the prevaccine era [A7, A10]. Likewise, prevalent HPV 6 and
11 infection decreased by 40% and 72%, respectively, in Swedish
females aged 13–22 years [A13] (Figure 2D).
Genital Warts
Declines in the prevalence and incidence of genital warts
tracked closely with decreases in HPV 6/11 infections [A17,
A20, A23–A43] (Table 2). In countries with high vaccine uptake
(such as Australia and Denmark), marked reductions in the fre-
quency of genital warts were observed, particularly in the youn-
gest age groups at vaccination (Supplementary Table 4). In
women <21 years of age, yearly decreases of about 50% were ob-
served in several studies [A25, A27, A37, A42], and up to 92.6%
reduction was observed 4 years after vaccination program im-
plementation in Australia [A24]. Furthermore, reductions

 were observed in unvaccinated young men, consistent with herd
protection. In countries with moderate to low uptake of the vac-
cine at the time of the study (including France, United States, Can-
ada, Sweden, Belgium, Germany, and New Zealand), the
reduction in genital warts was lower (from 5.5% [A42] to 72.1%
[A17]), varying widely depending on setting, age group, and time
period considered. Reductions were mainly observed in young
women targeted by vaccination programs, and evidence of herd
protection was found in some studies [A17, A23, A24, A26, A36].
Generally high effectiveness against genital warts was ob-
served for 3 vaccine doses (76%–93% [A16–A19]), with one ex-
ception [A20] where point estimates varied between 44% and
66% depending on specificity of the case definition (Supple-
mentary Table 5).
Cervical Cytological and Histological Abnormalities
Within the first 5 years of Australia’s 4vHPV vaccination pro-
gram in Victoria, overall declines of 34% and 47% in low- and
high-grade cervical cytological abnormalities, respectively, were
evident in vaccinated cohorts of females 12–26 years of age at
the start of the program, in comparison to unvaccinated fe-
males, with the largest declines in the 20- to 23-year-old age
group (47% and 48%, respectively) [A44] (Figure 3A). Similar
declines in low-grade abnormalities (20%–40%) among vacci-
nated (2–3 doses) compared with unvaccinated females aged
11–27 years in 2007 were also observed in Queensland, Austra-
lia [A45] (Figure 3B). Two studies of primarily low-grade cyto-
logical abnormalities in Canada [A20, A47] reported declines of
approximately 20%–45% in vaccinated vs unvaccinated females
aged 14–17 years (Figure 3C). Nationwide studies in Denmark re-
ported 13%–33% estimated annual percentage declines in the in-
cidence of cytological atypia or worse among 12- to 20-year-olds
(impact) and 25%–60% declines in atypia or worse (effectiveness)
[A48, A51] (Figure 3D). In each study, the greatest declines were
among the younger age groups vaccinated with 2–3 doses. Only 1
study reported low-grade histological outcomes (CIN1) [A46],
noting a 17% decrease among vaccinated vs unvaccinated Austra-
lian females 12–17 years of age in 2007 (Figure 3A).
For CIN2, CIN3, and AIS, the largest declines were found in
younger cohorts and higher-grade lesions. In a nationwide
Swedish analysis where vaccinated and unvaccinated women
were followed for a mean of 2.6 and 5.1 years, respectively, de-
clines of CIN2+ and CIN3+ among fully vaccinated females <17
years of age at vaccination were 75% and 84%, respectively,
compared with unvaccinated and partially vaccinated females;
in contrast, among those vaccinated between 20 and 29 years
of age, declines in CIN2+ and CIN3+ were 22% and 25%, re-
spectively [A50] (Figure 3E). Similarly, in a nationwide analysis
from Denmark, respective declines for CIN2+ and CIN3+ of
73% and 80% were observed in the youngest birth cohort eligi-
ble for vaccination, and 12% and 22% in the oldest eligible birth
cohort (born 1989–1990), compared with unvaccinated women
[A48, A51] (Figure 3D). In Victoria, Australia, a similar age-re-
lated risk reduction was observed; among women vaccinated
with ≥1 dose prior to their first cervical screening who were
12–26 years of age in 2007 with a mean age at vaccination
of 21–22 years and an average follow-up <3 years, declines of
CIN2/CIN3/AIS ranged from 39% to 5% in younger and
older groups, respectively (Figure 3A), in comparison to unvac-
cinated women [A44]. In contrast, in Queensland, Australia,
among females 15–18 years of age in 2007 vaccinated with 3
doses followed for approximately 2 years, a 57% reduction in
CIN2+/AIS compared with unvaccinated women [A45] was re-
ported, whereas a 5% reduction among females 23–27 years of
age was reported in the same study (Figure 3B). In a US study of
women with a mean age at vaccination of 22 years given ≥1
dose, the greatest declines for HPV 16/18-related CIN3/
AIS (45%) and CIN2+ (72%) in comparison to unvaccinated
women were found when the Pap test leading to the diagnosis
occurred >4 years after vaccination [A49] (Figure 3F). A Cana-
dian impact study found a 69% decline in CIN2+ in screened 15-
to 17-year-olds after implementation of the HPV vaccination
program (compared with the prevaccine era), but <6% reduction
among females aged 18–22 years, who were ineligible for vacci-
nation under the school-based program [A58] (Figure 3C).
DISCUSSION
Prophylactic HPV vaccine programs constitute major public
health initiatives worldwide. We assessed the global real-world
impact and effectiveness of the 4vHPV vaccine over its first dec-
ade of use by systematically searching pertinent peer-reviewed lit-
erature. Estimates of 4vHPV vaccine effectiveness generally
corresponded to vaccine efficacy results from clinical trials [20–
22].Rapid reductions up to approximately 90% in HPV 6/11/16/
18 infections and genital warts after introduction of 4vHPV vac-
cination programs were first demonstrated in young women in
Australia, Europe, North America, and New Zealand. Availability
of population-based comparison data from the prevaccine era
[25, A7] facilitated demonstration of impact. In Australia and
the United States, decreases in the prevalence of HPV 6/11/16/
18 infection and genital warts became evident <4 years after
vaccine availability [A5, A12]. Subsequently, as successive birth
cohorts began cervical screening, reductions as high as approxi-
mately 45% in low-grade cytological abnormalities and approxi-
mately 85% in high-grade histologically confirmed cervical
lesions became apparent. For example, in Australia and Denmark
where programs had achieved high and timely coverage with
catch-up vaccination, respective reductions as high as 57% in
CIN2+ and 80% in CIN3+ lesions were reported in the youngest
cohorts vaccinated shortly after program implementation.
Caveats and Limitations
Whereas 4vHPV vaccination has consistently been successful in
reducing HPV 6/11/16/18 infection and disease, reported
Real-world Results With the 4vHPV Vaccine • CID 2016:63 (15 August) • 525
 estimates of impact vary widely. In addition to the actual effec-
tiveness of the vaccine itself, assessment of population impact
depends on multiple factors including the breadth of the immu-
nization program (cohort and catch-up), completeness and ac-
curacy of data sources, availability and utilization of screening
programs, the outcome under study, and vaccine coverage in fe-
males and males [26–30] [Supplementary Table 3]. Vaccine
coverage may in turn be affected by national priorities and
funding, access to healthcare, civil unrest, sexual practices,
and vaccine acceptance. These elements together determine
the measured impact in given populations. In this context, ex-
trapolations across studies should be interpreted cautiously,
with an emphasis on general trends rather than specific esti-
mates of percentage of reduction.
In some regions, both the 4vHPV and 2vHPV vaccines were
administered to a variable extent; however, the 4vHPV vaccine
was predominantly used in all reports in the current review.
Subsequent to 4vHPV vaccine introduction for females, some
countries (including the United States, Australia, Austria, and
Switzerland) have initiated HPV vaccination programs for
males as a gender-neutral approach.
The anticipated benefit of vaccination on HPV-related cancer
rates cannot be fully determined yet, because of the long latency
periods following exposure. As vaccinated girls reach the age of
cervical cancer screening, optimal cost-effective approaches to pri-
mary (preexposure vaccination) and secondary (periodic screen-
ing) prevention will need to be rethought [31,32].Some countries
such as Australia are already planning to change the age, method,
and frequency of screening in response to the high uptake and im-
pact of HPV vaccines [33, 34] (Supplementary Appendix II).
Future Challenges
The full potential of HPV vaccination is unfortunately far from
being realized. Despite development of efficacious prophylactic
vaccines, HPV-related diseases continue to present major pub-
lic health challenges for both developing and developed nations.
HPV vaccination rates appear to be lowest in low-income coun-
tries with the highest ongoing burden of HPV-related diseases.
Globally, only 6.2% of females reaching 15 years of age in 2014
have received the vaccine [35], even with licensure in 129 coun-
tries, with 64 countries having HPV vaccines in their national
immunization programs [18] (Supplementary Table 1). World-
wide, >600 000 new cancer cases are attributable to HPV annu-
ally, and HPV still causes nearly 10% of all new cancers in
women worldwide, disproportionately affecting women in de-
veloping-world regions where 86% of incident cervical cancer
cases and 88% of cancer deaths occur [36].
The World Health Organization recognizes the importance
of cervical cancer and other HPV-related diseases as global pub-
lic health threats and has reiterated its recommendation that
HPV vaccines should be included in national immunization
programs, provided that prevention of cervical cancer and/or
other HPV-related diseases constitutes a public-health priority,
vaccine introduction is programmatically feasible, sustainable
financing can be secured, and the cost-effectiveness of vaccina-
tion strategies in the region is considered [37].
Many diverse hurdles remain before the global burden of
HPV-related diseases can be further reduced. Unfounded no-
tions about vaccine-related adverse experiences have derailed
implementation of HPV vaccination programs in some coun-
tries, despite the positive safety profile observed over a decade
of 4vHPV vaccine use and >200 million doses distributed [38,
39]. Although no intervention is without some risk, the chal-
lenge for public health officials and individual caregivers is to
counterbalance the perceived vaccine-safety concerns against
the unacceptably high numbers of women and men currently
suffering and dying from HPV-related cancers. Explicit physi-
cian recommendations and healthcare provider reminder/recall
systems could serve to improve vaccination rates. Integrating
HPV vaccination with new, more sensitive cervical screening as-
says as part of routine primary preventive care will improve
healthcare for all women.
CONCLUSIONS
Over the last decade, the impact of the 4vHPV vaccine in real-
world settings has become increasingly documented and is at-
tributable to high vaccine effectiveness in targeted populations
with high coverage [20, 21]. The greatest impact has been seen
where the vaccine is routinely administered before HPV expo-
sure. Vaccination of catch-up cohorts has accelerated observed
benefits. Disappointingly, preventable HPV-related diseases
persist, underscoring the need for wide-reaching HPV vaccina-
tion programs with high population coverage prior to HPV ex-
posure. Universal adoption of safe and effective prophylactic
HPV vaccine programs targeting girls and boys before sexual
debut can prevent the substantial morbidity and mortality still
attributable to HPV worldwide [20, 21, 32, 40]. Ensuring broad
coverage of appropriate populations can provide a major ad-
vancement in global public health.
