Abstract
Background: The loss of skeletal muscle mass with aging has been attributed to the blunted anabolic response to protein
intake. Presleep protein ingestion has been suggested as an effective strategy to compensate for such anabolic resistance.
Objective: We assessed the efficacy of presleep protein ingestion on dietary protein digestion and absorption kinetics and
overnight muscle protein synthesis rates in older men.
Methods: In a randomized, double-blind, parallel design, 48 older men (mean 6 SEM age: 72 6 1 y) ingested 40 g casein (PRO40),
20 g casein (PRO20), 20 g casein plus 1.5 g leucine (PRO20+LEU), or a placebo before sleep. Ingestion of intrinsically L-[1-13C]-
phenylalanine– and L-[1-13C]-leucine–labeled protein was combined with intravenous L-[ring-2H5]-phenylalanine and L-[1-13C]-leucine
infusions during sleep. Muscle and blood samples were collected throughout overnight sleep.
Results: Exogenous phenylalanine appearance rates increased after protein ingestion, but to a greater extent in PRO40 than in
PRO20 and PRO20+LEU (P < 0.05). Overnight myofibrillar protein synthesis rates (based on L-[ring-2H5]-phenylalanine) were
0.033% 6 0.002%/h, 0.037% 6 0.003%/h, 0.039% 6 0.002%/h, and 0.044% 6 0.003%/h in placebo, PRO20, PRO20+LEU,
and PRO40, respectively, and were higher in PRO40 than in placebo (P = 0.02). Observations were similar based on L-[1-13C]-
leucine tracer (placebo: 0.047% 6 0.004%/h and PRO40: 0.058% 6 0.003%/h, P = 0.08). More protein-derived amino
acids (L-[1-13C]-phenylalanine) were incorporated into myofibrillar protein in PRO40 than in PRO20 (0.033 6 0.002 and
0.019 6 0.002 MPE, respectively, P < 0.001) and tended to be higher than in PRO20+LEU (0.025 6 0.002 MPE, P = 0.06).
Conclusions: Protein ingested before sleep is properly digested and absorbed throughout the night, providing precursors
for myofibrillar protein synthesis during sleep in healthy older men. Ingestion of 40 g protein before sleep increases
myofibrillar protein synthesis rates during overnight sleep. These findings provide the scientific basis for a novel nutritional
strategy to support muscle mass preservation in aging and disease. This trial was registered at www.trialregister.nl as
NTR3885.

Introduction
Age-related changes in skeletal muscle mass are attributed to a
disruption in the regulation of muscle protein synthesis and
breakdown rates. Protein ingestion stimulates muscle protein
synthesis and forms an important factor in maintaining skeletal
muscle mass over the lifespan (1). The ingestion of 20 g protein

 increases muscle protein synthesis rates by ;75% in young
individuals (2–4), whereas ;40 g protein seems to be required to
allow a similar postprandial rise in muscle protein synthesis rates
in the older population (5–8). Besides ingesting larger amounts
of protein, fortifying lower amounts of protein with free leucine
has been shown to increase postprandial muscle protein synthe-
sis rates (9–11). Instead of increasing the anabolic response to a
single meal, we recently proposed the overnight period as a
window of opportunity to stimulate muscle protein synthesis.
In a first proof-of-concept study, we showed that 40 g protein
administered via a nasogastric tube during sleep is rapidly
digested and absorbed, with dietary protein–derived amino acids
being used for de novo muscle protein synthesis during overnight
sleep (12). Intragastric feeding during sleep may represent an
interesting clinical strategy to preserve skeletal muscle mass in
hospitalized patients but does not represent a feasible dietary
strategy to support muscle mass maintenance in healthy or less
clinically compromised older individuals. We therefore propose
presleep protein ingestion as a nutritional strategy to augment
muscle protein synthesis rates during the overnight period to
support muscle mass preservation in the older population.
The present study (registered at www.trialregister.nl as
NTR3885) assessed the effect of varying amounts of protein
ingested before sleep on overnight muscle protein synthesis
during a 7.5-h postprandial period. In contrast to typical post-
prandial periods of 4–6 h (5–8), such an extended overnight
period should allow the ingested protein dose to be fully digested
and absorbed throughout the night. We hypothesized that
ingesting 40 g protein before sleep would increase overnight
plasma amino acid availability, thereby stimulating overnight
muscle protein synthesis in older individuals. Because smaller
amounts of protein would be more practical to ingest, we eval-
uated the effect of ingesting 20 g protein on overnight muscle
protein synthesis rates. We also assessed whether fortifying the
lower 20-g protein dose with 1.5 g free leucine (providing the
same amount of leucine as 40 g protein) can further augment
the overnight muscle protein synthetic response compared with
the presleep ingestion of 20 g protein.
Methods
Subjects. A total of 48 healthy, normoglycemic, older men [mean 6 SEM
age: 72 6 1 y; BMI (in kg/m2): 25.4 6 0.3; glycated hemoglobin: 5.5% 6
0.1%] participated in this study. Subjects� characteristics are presented
in Table 1. After pretesting, subjects were randomly assigned to 1 of
4 groups: 40 g casein (PRO40), 20 g casein (PRO20), 20 g casein plus
1.5 g of crystalline leucine (PRO20+LEU), or placebo. Randomization
was computer generated, and all procedures and analysis were performed
in a double-blind manner. The trial was conducted between April 2013
and October 2013 at Maastricht University Medical Centre1, Maastricht,
Netherlands. All participants were informed about the purpose of the
study, the experimental procedures, and possible risks before providing
written consent. This study is part of a greater project investigating the
effect of presleep protein ingestion on overnight muscle protein
synthesis. Data from the PRO40 group were published in recent work
that assessed the effect of physical activity performed in the evening on
overnight muscle protein synthesis (13). The present study was approved
by the Maastricht University Medical Centre1 Medical Ethical Com-
mittee, Maastricht, Netherlands, and conformed to the latest version of
the Declaration of Helsinki.
Pretesting. After an overnight fast, participants arrived at the labora-
tory at 0830 by car or public transport. All participants underwent a
medical screening to assess glycated hemoglobin, glucose tolerance,
blood pressure, weight, height, and body composition (DXA, Discovery
A; Hologic). Plasma glucose and insulin concentrations were measured
at baseline and 2 h after a 75 g glucose load was ingested to determine
oral glucose intolerance or the presence of type 2 diabetes according to
2006 American Diabetes Association guidelines (14). Inclusion criteria
were male sex, age $65 y, and a BMI from 20 to 30. Subjects were
excluded if any comorbidities or use of medication affecting muscle
metabolism and mobility of the limbs, interfering with gastrointestinal
function, neurologic or renal diseases, diagnosed diabetes mellitus,
smoking, and weight loss >3 kg in the last 3 mo, the use of protein
supplements, participation in an exercise program, or coagulation
diseases were present. All subjects were deemed healthy before the
experimental trial. See Supplemental Figure 1 for the Consolidated
Standards of Reporting Trials flow diagram. The pretesting and
experimental trials were separated by a period of $7 d.
Diet and physical activity control. All volunteers refrained from any
exhaustive physical activity and kept their diet as constant as possible
48 h before the trial. On the day of the experiment, a standardized diet
(3 meals and 2 snacks) was consumed that provided 9.3 6 0.6 MJ total
energy, 55 6 2 energy% (En%) carbohydrate, 27 6 2 En% fat, and 16 6
0.2 En% protein. The energy content of the standardized diet was based
on individual energy requirements (Harris-Benedict equation) and
adjusted with the use of a physical activity factor of 1.4 to ensure ample
energy intake. Dietary protein intake was a mean of 1.1 6 0.01 g/kg
body weight, with 35% 6 1% of the protein provided at dinner
(i.e., containing 29 6 2 g protein). A visual analog scale (VAS) was used
to assess hunger ratings before and in the morning after the intervention
(15). In the morning after the experimental trial, subjects were invited to
an ad libitum breakfast where food intake was recorded.
Experimental protocol. At 1730, participants reported to the labora-
tory where 2 catheters were inserted into an antecubital vein of both
arms. After basal blood collection at 1830 (t = 2300 min relative to
drink ingestion), subjects consumed a standardized dinner under super-
vision (2.6 6 0.1 MJ, providing 62 En% carbohydrate, 19 En% protein,
and 19 En% fat). Subjects rested until the initiation of the tracer infusion
protocol at 2100. The plasma phenylalanine, tyrosine, and leucine pools
were primed with a single intravenous dose of L-[ring-2H5]-phenylalanine
(2.0 mmol/kg), L-[ring-3,5-2H2]-tyrosine (0.6 mmol/kg), and L-[1-13C]-
leucine (4.0 mmol/kg). Thereafter, a continuous stable isotope infusion
was initiated (t = 2150 min) at an infusion rate of 0.050 mmol � kg21 �
min21 for L-[ring-2H5]-phenylalanine, 0.015 mmol � kg21 � min21 for
L-[ring-3,5-2H2]-tyrosine, and 0.100 mmol � kg21 � min21 for L-[1-13C]-
leucine. Participants rested supine for 2.5 h. At 2330 (t = 0 min), a skeletal
muscle biopsy was taken. Subjects then ingested the beverage that
contained 0, 20, or 40 g casein intrinsically labeled with L-[1-13C]-
phenylalanine and L-[1-13C]-leucine (placebo, PRO20, PRO20+LEU, or
PRO40, respectively) within 5 min and went to sleep afterward at ;0000.
During the night, blood samples (10 mL) were collected without waking
the subjects at t = 30, 60, 90, 150, 210, 270, 330, 390, and 450 min
relative to the drink ingestion (see Supplemental Methods 1 for complete
details). A second muscle biopsy was obtained from the contralateral leg
7.5 h later at ;0700 (t = 450 min). Blood samples were collected in tubes
containing EDTA and centrifuged at 1000 3 g for 10 min at 4�C. Aliquots
of plasma were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 280�C. The percuta-
neous needle biopsy technique was used to obtain muscle biopsy samples
from the middle region of the vastus lateralis, 15 cm above the patella
and ~4 cm below entry through the fascia (16). Muscle samples were dissected
carefully, freed from any visible nonmuscle material, and were immedi-
ately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 280�C until further analysis.
Production of intrinsically labeled protein and tracer infusion.
Details on the production and experimental use of intrinsically L-[1-13C]-
phenylalanine– and L-[1-13C]-leucine–labeled casein have been reported
previously (17–19). The L-[1-13C]-phenylalanine and L-[1-13C]-leucine
enrichments in casein averaged 38.7 and 9.3 mole percent excess (MPE),
respectively. The micellar casein met all chemical and bacteriologic
specifications for human consumption. Micellar casein protein was
selected for this study because it represents the more slowly digestible
protein source and should thus allow for a more sustained release of

 amino acids throughout overnight sleep (20) and was the only
intrinsically labeled protein available in our laboratory at the time. All
test beverages contained 450 mL water, with 149 or 298 g micellar casein
concentrate containing 20 or 40 g protein, respectively, and were
flavored and matched for taste by adding 1.5 mL noncaloric vanilla
flavor (Dr. Oetker). In the PRO20+LEU treatment, 1.5 g crystalline
leucine (99.95% L-leucine; Frutarom Ltd.) was added to the beverage,
matching the leucine content of the PRO40 treatment. The placebo
treatment consisted of 450 mL water with 1.5 mL vanilla flavor. The
stable
isotope
tracers
L-[ring-2H5]-phenylalanine,
L-[ring-3,5-2H2]-
tyrosine, and L-[1-13C]-leucine were purchased from Cambridge Isotopes
and dissolved in 0.9% saline before infusion (Basic Pharma). Continuous
intravenous infusions were performed with the use of a calibrated IVAC
598 Volumetric Infusion Pump (Cardinal Health).
Sleep quality assessment. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (Sleep
Medicine Institute, University of Pittsburgh) was used to assess habitual sleep
quality during pretesting, before randomization (21). Pittsburgh Sleep Quality
Index scoring (0–21 points) was used to classify subjects as ‘‘very good,’’
‘‘good,’’ ‘‘poor,’’ or ‘‘very poor’’ sleepers. Subjects that scored >5 (‘‘poor’’ or
‘‘very poor’’sleepers) were excluded from participation. Sleep behavior during
the night was monitored with wrist activity monitors and analyzed with
Actiware software (Philips Respironics) (22). Time was scored as awake
unless the following conditions were met simultaneously: 1) participant was
lying down attempting to sleep and 2) the activity counts from the monitor
were sufficiently low to indicate that the participant was immobile. Start and
end time of sleep were also recorded throughout the trial. The following
variables were derived from sleep records and activity monitors: bedtime
(clock time), get-up time (clock time), time in bed (the amount spent in bed
attempting to sleep between bedtime and get-up time), sleep onset latency (the
period between bedtime and sleep start), sleep duration (in hours), sleep
efficiency (percentage of sleep duration expressed as a percentage of time in
bed), and total sleep time (in hours: the sum of the sleep obtained at night).
Plasma analyses. Plasma glucose and insulin concentrations were ana-
lyzed with the use of commercially available kits (GLUC3, Ref: 05168791
190, and Immunologic, Ref: 12017547 122, respectively, Roche). Plasma
amino acid concentrations and enrichments were determined by GC-MS
analysis (Agilent 7890A GC/5975C; mass selective detector, Agilent
Technologies). For complete details please see Supplemental Methods 1.
Muscle analyses. Myofibrillar protein–enriched fractions were ex-
tracted from ;60 mg wet muscle tissue by hand-homogenizing on ice
with a pestle in a standard extraction buffer (7 mL/mg) (23). Myofibrillar
protein–bound L-[ring-2H5]-phenylalanine enrichments were determined
by GC-MS, and myofibrillar protein–bound L-[1-13C]-phenylalanine
enrichments were measured by gas chromatography-combustion isotope
ratio mass spectrometry (GC-CIRMS) (Trace GC Ultra, IRMS model
MAT 253; Thermo Scientific) with the use of a DB-5ms column (no. 122-
5532; Agilent J+W Scientific GC Column, GC Isolink). For complete
details please see Supplemental Methods 1.
Calculations. Ingestion of L-[1-13C]-phenylalanine–labeled protein, in-
travenous infusion of L-[ring-2H5]-phenylalanine and L-[ring-3,5-2H2]-
tyrosine, and venous blood sampling were used to assess whole-body amino
acid kinetics in non–steady-state conditions. Modified Steele�s equations
were used to calculate total, exogenous, and endogenous phenylalanine
rates of appearance (expressed as mmol phenylalanine � kg21 � min21) as
well as plasma availability of dietary protein–derived phenylalanine that
appeared in the systemic circulation as a fraction of total amount of
phenylalanine that was ingested (see Supplemental Methods 1) (24–26).
Furthermore, the total rate of phenylalanine disappearance, use of
phenylalanine for protein synthesis, and phenylalanine hydroxylation (first
step of phenylalanine conversion to tyrosine) were calculated. Whole-body
protein net balance was calculated as the AUC over the 7.5-h postprandial
phase (t = 0–450 min) by using whole-body protein synthesis minus the
endogenous rate of appearance. The fractional synthesis rate (FSR) of
myofibrillar protein was calculated by using the standard precursor-product
equation. For complete details please see Supplemental Methods 1.
Statistics. All data are expressed as mean 6 SEM. Baseline character-
istics between treatment groups were compared by using 1-factor
ANOVA. Plasma metabolite concentrations, plasma amino acid enrich-
ments, and whole-body protein kinetics measured over time were
analyzed by 2-factor repeated-measures ANOVAwith time as the within-
subjects factor and treatment group as the between-subjects factor. The
analysis was done for the period starting at the time of protein ingestion,
between t = 0 and t = 450 min. In case of significant time 3 treatment
group interactions, separate analyses were performed to determine time
effects for each treatment group (1-factor repeated-measures ANOVA)
and treatment effects for each time point (1-factor ANOVA). In addition,
1-factor ANOVA was used to determine differences between treatment
groups for peak plasma values as well as the incremental AUC and
differences in whole-body protein turnover rates and myofibrillar protein
synthesis. In case of significant main effects of treatment group, a Tukey�s
post hoc test was applied to locate group differences.
Results from our previous work (12) were used to calculate a sample
size (G*Power 3.1.9.2 software; Heinrich-Heine-University, Dusseldorf,
Germany) by using an FSR of 0.029% 6 0.0052%/h for the placebo
group and a clinically relevant difference in FSR of ;30% (5, 12). With a
power of 80%, a 2-sided significance level of 0.01 (to adjust for multiple
post hoc testing), and a dropout rate of 10%, the final number of
participants to be included after screening was calculated as n = 12/group.
No dropouts occurred in the 4 treatment groups. Statistical significance was
set at P < 0.05. All calculations were performed with SPSS Statistics 24.0
software (IBM Corp.).

 effect, P < 0.05; Supplemental Figure 2A). Plasma insulin con-
centrations increased rapidly after protein ingestion but not after
placebo (time 3 treatment group interaction, P < 0.001) and
were higher during the overnight period in PRO20+LEU and
PRO40 than in placebo (P < 0.001, Supplemental Figure 2B).
A main treatment group effect (P < 0.001) showed that peak
plasma insulin concentrations were higher in all protein groups
than in the placebo group (all P < 0.05).
Plasma amino acid concentrations are shown in Figures 1 and
2. Significant time 3 treatment group interactions were observed
for all plasma amino acid concentrations (all P < 0.001). Plasma
phenylalanine concentrations increased after protein ingestion
(main time effects in all protein groups, all P < 0.001) and were
elevated throughout the night in the protein groups compared
with the placebo group (P < 0.001; Figure 1A). Plasma tyrosine
concentrations increased after protein ingestion (main time
effects in all protein groups, all P < 0.001; Figure 1B) and were
higher than in the placebo group (P < 0.001). Plasma leucine
concentrations increased rapidly after protein ingestion (main
time effects in all protein groups, P < 0.001; Figure 2A), but to
a greater extent in PRO20+LEU (peak values: 396 6 20 mmol/L)
than in PRO40 and PRO20 (316 6 19 and 269 6 10 mmol/L,
respectively, P < 0.001). The incremental AUC (Figure 2B) did
not differ between PRO20+LEU and PRO40 (P = 0.56), but both
were higher than in PRO20 and placebo (both P < 0.001), and
PRO20 was higher than in placebo (P < 0.001).
Plasma amino acid enrichments. Significant time 3 treat-
ment group interactions were observed for all plasma amino acid
enrichments (all P < 0.05). Plasma L-[1-13C]-phenylalanine
enrichments increased after protein ingestion (main time effects
in all protein groups, all P < 0.001; Figure 3A), and peak values
were different between groups (main treatment group effect,
P < 0.001), with higher enrichments observed in PRO40 (12.9 6
0.7 MPE) than in PRO20 and PRO20+LEU (10.8 6 0.4 and
10.1 6 0.5 MPE, respectively, both P < 0.05). Plasma amino
acid availability, as a fraction from the ingested amount of
protein, differed between treatment groups (main treatment
group effect, P < 0.001) and was higher in PRO20 and PRO20
+LEU (69% 6 1% and 64% 6 2%, respectively) than in PRO40

 (53% 6 3%, both P < 0.001). The absolute amount of dietary
protein derived from the drink that appeared in the circulation
during the 7.5-h overnight postprandial period differed between
groups (main treatment group effect, P < 0.001; Figure 3B) and
was higher in PRO40 (21.3 6 1.2 g) than in PRO20 and
PRO20+LEU (13.8 6 0.3 and 12.8 6 0.4 g, respectively, both
P < 0.001), with no differences between PRO20 and PRO20+LEU
(P = 0.70; Figure 3B). Plasma L-[ring-2H5]-phenylalanine enrich-
ments were higher in the placebo group than in the PRO groups
(P < 0.001; Supplemental Figure 3A). Plasma L-[1-13C]-leucine
enrichments were higher in PRO40 than in placebo (P < 0.05;
Supplemental Figure 3B).
Whole-body amino acids kinetics. Whole-body protein
kinetics are displayed in Figure 4. A significant time 3 treatment
group interaction (P < 0.001) showed an increase in exogenous
phenylalanine rates of appearance after protein intake in all
groups (P < 0.001), which was higher in PRO40 (peak values:
0.26 6 0.02 mmol phenylalanine � kg21 � min21) than in PRO20
and PRO20+LEU (0.22 6 0.01 and 0.18 6 0.01 mmol phenyl-
alanine � kg21 � min21, respectively, both P < 0.05; Figure 4A).
Endogenous phenylalanine rates of appearance decreased in
all groups (main time effect, P < 0.001) with no differences
between groups (time 3 treatment group interaction, P = 0.30;
Figure 4B). Significant time 3 treatment group interactions were
observed for total phenylalanine rates of appearance and
disappearance (both P < 0.001). Follow-up analyses showed a
decrease in all groups in total phenylalanine rates of appearance
(P < 0.001), and higher values in the protein groups than in the
placebo group (P < 0.001; Figure 4C). Total phenylalanine rates
of disappearance were higher in all protein groups than in the
placebo group (P < 0.05; Figure 4D).
Whole-body protein metabolism is shown in Figure 5. Whole-
body protein synthesis rates differed between groups (main treatment
group effect, P < 0.001), and were higher in PRO20, PRO20+LEU,
and PRO40 than in placebo (all P < 0.05). Whole-body protein
breakdown rates did not differ between treatments (P = 0.26).
Whole-body protein oxidation rates were different between
treatments (main treatment group effect, P < 0.001) and were
higher in PRO40 and PRO20 than in placebo (both P < 0.05),
and in PRO40 than in PRO20 and PRO20+LEU (both P < 0.05).

Discussion
In the present study we show that protein ingested before sleep
was properly digested and absorbed throughout the night,
thereby increasing overnight plasma amino acid availability and
facilitating myofibrillar protein synthesis during sleep in healthy
older men. Ingestion of 40 g protein before sleep increased
overnight muscle protein synthesis rates (0.044% 6 0.003%/h)
compared with the placebo treatment (0.033% 6 0.002%/h;
P = 0.02). Ingesting a smaller (20 g) dose of protein, with or
without additional leucine, did not significantly increase over-
night muscle protein synthesis rates compared with the placebo
intervention.
Because gut motility and gastric acid secretion are affected by
circadian oscillations, the pH of the stomach has been specu-
lated to change during sleep, which may affect digestion and
absorption (i.e. clotting of the casein) (27). By combining the
ingestion of intrinsically L-[1-13C]-phenylalanine–labeled pro-
tein with primed continuous infusions of
L-[ring-2H5]-
phenylalanine we were able to quantify the rate of appearance
of dietary protein–derived amino acids during overnight sleep
(17, 18). Presleep protein ingestion increased overnight plasma
amino acid availability with 53% 6 3%, 69% 6 1%, and 64% 6
2% of protein-derived amino acids being released into the
systemic circulation during the 7.5-h overnight period in
PRO40, PRO20, and PRO20+LEU treatments, respectively
(Figure 3B). As expected, more dietary protein–derived amino
acids were released after the ingestion of 40 g than after 20 g
protein, with greater exogenous amino acid appearance rates
in the PRO40 treatment up into the later stages of overnight
sleep (Figure 4A). These data tend to be in line with our previous
work (12) showing 58% 6 4% of the protein-derived amino
acids becoming available in the circulation after the adminis-
tration of 40 g protein during sleep via a nasogastric tube. The
present study extends this prior work by showing that protein
ingested before sleep is properly digested and absorbed during
subsequent overnight sleep, with postprandial plasma amino
acid availability being similar to nasogastric tube feeding
during sleep.
The release of dietary protein–derived amino acids into the
circulation stimulated whole-body protein synthesis rates during
the overnight phase. This resulted in a positive whole-body
protein net balance during overnight sleep in all protein groups
compared with a zero net balance that was observed in the
placebo group (Figure 5). Because plasma amino acid kinetics do
not necessarily reflect changes in skeletal muscle protein
turnover (28), we also obtained skeletal muscle biopsy samples
before and after overnight sleep and measured the L-[1-13C]-
phenylalanine, L-[ring-2H5]-phenylalanine, and L-[1-13C]-leucine
incorporation into myofibrillar protein. Consequently, this
allowed us to quantify the effect of protein ingestion on over-
night muscle protein synthesis rates (Figure 6) and assess the
direct incorporation of dietary protein–derived amino acids into
de novo myofibrillar protein (Figure 7).

 The ingestion of 40 g protein before sleep increased overnight
muscle protein synthesis rates by ;33% above values observed
in the placebo group (based on the L-[ring-2H5]-phenylalanine
tracer, P = 0.02; Figure 6). Likewise, a ;25% higher FSR was
observed in PRO40 than in placebo based on the L-[1-13C]-
leucine tracer, although this difference did not reach statistical
significance (P = 0.08). These findings are in line with our first
proof-of-concept study where we reported a similar increase in
overnight muscle protein synthesis rates after the nasogastric
administration of 40 g protein during sleep in older men (12).
We extend this work by showing that ingesting protein before
sleep increases overnight amino acid availability, thereby
increasing myofibrillar protein synthesis rates during sleep in
healthy older men. Ingestion of 20 g compared with 40 g protein
did not increase overnight muscle protein synthesis rates (Figure
6), confirming our hypothesis that more protein is required to
stimulate muscle protein synthesis during the extended post-
prandial overnight period (7.5 h) in healthy older men. Because
we anticipated a lower muscle protein synthetic response after
the ingestion of 20 g protein compared with 40 g protein, we
assessed whether overnight muscle protein synthesis rates could
be further increased by ingesting 20 g protein fortified with free
leucine. Previous work has shown that increasing the leucine
content in a dose of protein or amino acids can augment the
postprandial muscle protein synthetic response in older individ-
uals (9–11).
Despite the greater plasma leucine availability after leucine
co-ingestion (Figure 2), we observed no substantial increase in
overnight muscle protein synthesis rates. The absence of a
stimulating effect after leucine co-ingestion could be attributed
to the absence of a robust insulin response during the overnight
period, the lack of sufficient amino acids as precursors for
muscle protein synthesis during the relatively long overnight
period, or simply that the stimulating properties of leucine are
less evident during sleep. We conclude that only increasing the
leucine content of a 20-g protein dose is not sufficient to drive a
similar overnight muscle protein synthetic response to the levels
observed after the presleep ingestion of 40 g protein. These data
suggest that the greater plasma amino acid availability after
ingestion of 40 g compared with 20 g protein during the longer
overnight period may be required to allow a measurable increase
in muscle protein synthesis rates.
We applied highly enriched (;39 MPE), intrinsically
L-[1-13C]-phenylalanine–labeled casein to allow assessment of
the metabolic fate of the ingested protein by measuring the
incorporation of dietary protein–derived amino acids into de
novo myofibrillar protein. Protein ingested before sleep resulted
in a substantial increase in myofibrillar protein–bound
L-[1-13C]-phenylalanine enrichments, with more dietary protein–
derived amino acids being incorporated after the ingestion of
40 g compared with 20 g protein (P < 0.001; Figure 7). Despite
the absence of a measurable increase in overnight muscle protein
synthesis rates after ingestion of 20 g protein, these data clearly
show that protein ingested before sleep provides ample precursors
that are being used to support overnight muscle protein synthesis.
Co-ingestion of free leucine with 20 g protein was not effective in
further increasing the overnight deposition of dietary protein–
derived amino acids into de novo myofibrillar protein (P = 0.17;
Figure 7).
Here, we show that presleep protein ingestion increases
overnight muscle protein synthesis rates, even in a setting where
substantial amounts (1.1 6 0.01 g � kg21 � d21) of protein are
already consumed throughout the day, with a normal protein-
rich dinner (29 6 2 g protein) ingested 5 h before sleep. Presleep
protein ingestion provides a window of opportunity to stimulate
muscle protein synthesis during a period where muscle protein
synthesis rates are typically low (12, 29). Moreover, we show
that protein ingestion before sleep provides amino acids as
precursors for de novo overnight muscle protein synthesis. This
nutritional strategy may be of relevance for older individuals
aiming to maintain skeletal muscle mass and also sarcopenic
individuals who have already lost substantial amounts of muscle
mass and strength.
Several studies have reported increases in lean body mass
after prolonged protein supplementation in various older
populations (30–32), whereas others have failed to show
measurable increases in muscle mass or strength (33–36). A
proper distribution of protein intake over the main meals has
been proposed to increase muscle protein synthesis rates
throughout the day (37–39) and is associated with higher lean
mass in older adults (40). However, whether a more balanced
protein distribution also increases skeletal muscle mass and
strength should be evaluated in long-term intervention studies.
We believe that a proper distribution (both timing and quantity)
of protein intake is essential to allow protein supplementa-
tion to increase muscle mass, strength, and function, which
includes presleep protein ingestion. Besides optimizing the
protein content with every meal, we recently showed that phys-
ical activity performed in the evening can further enhance the
overnight muscle protein synthetic response to presleep protein
ingestion in older subjects (13). As such, combining presleep
protein ingestion with physical activity may serve as an effective
strategy to preserve skeletal muscle mass with aging. Interest-
ingly, we showed that daily presleep protein ingestion increases
the gains in muscle mass and strength after 3 mo of resistance-
type exercise training in young men who were already consum-
ing ample amounts of protein in their diet (1.3 g � kg21 � d21)
(41). Future work should establish the effect of long-term
intervention programs using presleep protein ingestion (com-
bined with physical activity) on lean mass and functional capac-
ity in healthy or clinically compromised older populations. More
work is needed on the effect of protein intake distribution and
overnight muscle protein synthesis rates in older individuals.
Although ;40 g high-quality protein seems to be required to
maximize postprandial muscle protein synthesis rates in older
individuals (42), a definite upper threshold remains to be
established. Also, previous work has shown greater stimulation
of postprandial FSR after whey ingestion than after casein
ingestion (20). Yet, the anabolic response to whey protein
ingestion has also been shown to be relatively short lived. Which
protein source would be preferred to stimulate muscle protein
synthesis throughout overnight sleep clearly remains to be
determined. In addition, more work is warranted to assess the
effect of reducing the amount of time spent in a fasting state not
only on whole-body and tissue-specific protein turnover but also
on overall metabolism (43–46). Finally, we need to evaluate how
overnight muscle protein metabolism modulates protein metab-
olism during the day, and vice versa.
In conclusion, the ingestion of 40 g casein before sleep is
followed by proper protein digestion and amino acid absorption
throughout the night, thereby increasing overnight plasma
amino acid availability and stimulating overnight muscle protein
synthesis in healthy older men. Presleep ingestion of smaller
doses of protein (20 g), with or without additional free leucine,
do not seem sufficient to increase overnight muscle protein syn-
thesis rates but do provide amino acids as precursors for myo-
fibrillar protein synthesis during overnight sleep in healthy older
men. The present study introduces presleep protein ingestion

 as a practical and effective dietary strategy to stimulate overnight
muscle protein accretion and, as such, may help to attenuate or
prevent muscle loss in both health and disease.
