Abstract
The transcription factor NRF2 is a master regulator of the cellular antioxidant response and is 
often genetically activated in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancers (NSCLCs) by, for instance, mutations 
in the interacting protein KEAP1. While direct pharmacological inhibition of NRF2 has proven 
challenging, its aberrant activation rewires biochemical networks in cancer cells that may create 
special vulnerabilities. Here, we use chemical proteomics to map druggable proteins that are 
selectively expressed in KEAP1-mutant NSCLC cells. Principal among these was NR0B1, an 
atypical orphan nuclear receptor that we show engages in a multimeric protein complex to regulate 
the transcriptional output of KEAP1-mutant NSCLC cells. We further identify small molecules 
that covalently target a conserved cysteine within the NR0B1 protein interaction domain and 
demonstrate that these compounds disrupt NR0B1 complexes and impair the anchorage-

 independent growth of KEAP1-mutant cancer cells. Our findings designate NR0B1 as a 
druggable, transcriptional regulator that supports NRF2-dependent lung cancers.
Cancer cells rewire central metabolic networks to provide a steady source of energy and 
building blocks needed for cell division and rapid growth (Possemato et al., 2011; Vander 
Heiden et al., 2009). This demand for energy produces toxic metabolic byproducts, 
including reactive oxygen species (ROS), that, if left unchecked, can promote oxidative 
stress and impair cancer cell viability (Gorrini et al., 2013; Schafer et al., 2009). Many 
cancers counter a rise in oxidative stress by activating the NRF2 pathway, a master regulator 
of the cellular antioxidant response (Gorrini et al., 2013; Leinonen et al., 2014; Sporn and 
Liby, 2012). Under basal conditions, the bZip transcription factor NRF2 binds to the 
negative regulator KEAP1, which directs rapid and constitutive ubiquitination and 
proteasomal degradation of NRF2. Under conditions of oxidative stress, key cysteines in 
KEAP1 are oxidatively modified to block interaction with NRF2, stabilizing the 
transcription factor to allow for nuclear translocation and coordination of a gene expression 
program that induces detoxification and metabolic enzymes to restore redox homeostasis 
(Gorrini et al., 2013; Mitsuishi et al., 2012). Cancers stimulate NRF2 function in multiple 
ways, including genetic mutations in NRF2 and KEAP1 that disrupt their interaction and are 
found in > 20% of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) (Berger et al., 2016; Cancer 
Genome Atlas Research, 2014). Despite maturation in our understanding of how NRF2 
becomes activated and promotes a transcriptional program that responds to oxidative stress, 
the underlying molecular mechanisms by which stimulation of this pathway imparts a 
survival and growth advantage to cancer cells remain poorly defined. Moreover, to date, only 
a handful of early-stage small molecules have been identified that inhibit NRF2 function 
(Bollong et al., 2015; Lu et al., 2016), and as a consequence, oncogenic mutations in the 
KEAP1-NRF2 complex remain unactionable from a therapeutic perspective.
One amino acid residue that is particularly susceptible to oxidative modification is cysteine. 
Cysteines play important roles in proteins, including as nucleophiles in catalysis (Giles et 
al., 2003), as metal-binding residues (Pace and Weerapana, 2014), and as sites for post-
translational modification (Chung et al., 2013). While low levels of ROS can stimulate cell 
growth, excessive ROS has damaging effects on many fundamental biochemical processes in 
cells, including, for instance, metabolic (Gorrini et al., 2013) and protein homeostasis (Lee 
et al., 2013) pathways. Activation of NRF2 in cancer cells may thus serve to protect 
biochemical pathways from ROS-induced functional impairments.
Cysteine residues not only constitute sites for redox regulation of protein function, but also 
for covalent drug development (Johnson et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2013). Both catalytic and 
non-catalytic cysteines in a wide range of proteins have been targeted with electrophilic 
small molecules to create covalent inhibitors for use as chemical probes (Ostrem et al., 2013; 
Johnson et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2013) and therapeutic agents, including ibrutinib, which 
targets Bruton’s tyrosine kinase BTK for treatment of B-cell cancers (Pan, 2008) and 
afatinib and AZD9291, which target mutant forms of EGFR for treatment of lung cancer 
(Finlay et al., 2014). Recently, our lab performed a global analysis of cysteine ligandability 
in human cancer cell proteomes, revealing a rich content of cysteines amenable to

 modification by electrophilic small molecules (Backus et al., 2016). Some of these cysteines 
were found in proteins that have been historically considered undruggable, such as 
transcription factors and adaptor proteins, suggesting that cysteine-reactive covalent 
chemistry may substantially expand the portion of the human proteome that can be targeted 
by small-molecule probes.
Here, we have applied chemical proteomics to quantitatively and globally map cysteine 
reactivity in KEAP1-mutant and KEAP1-WT human NSCLC cell lines, resulting in the 
discovery of a core group of ligandable cysteines that are regulated by NRF2 and support 
key metabolic and transcriptional pathways. Chief among these was a conserved cysteine 
(C274) in the orphan nuclear receptor NR0B1, which is a strictly NRF2-regulated protein 
that supports the anchorage-independent growth of KEAP1-mutant NSCLC cells. We further 
discovered that NR0B1 forms a multimeric transcriptional complex important for regulating 
a subset of the NRF2 gene expression program in NSCLC cells. Finally, we describe 
covalent small-molecule ligands that target C274 of NR0B1 with good selectivity in cancer 
cells and find that these probes disrupt NR0B1 protein complexes and alter the 
transcriptional output and growth of NRF2-activated cancer cells.
Results
Mapping cysteine reactivity in KEAP1-WT and KEAP1-mutant NSCLC cells
We identified several human NSCLC cell lines that contain inactivating mutations in the 
gene encoding KEAP1 (H2122, H460, A549 and H1792), as well as additional NSCLC lines 
that were wild type (WT) for this gene (H1975 and H2009) (Table S1). Small hairpin RNA 
(shRNA)-mediated knockdown of NRF2 in NSCLC cell lines with KEAP1 mutations, where 
NRF2 protein levels are stabilized (Figure S1A), substantially impaired cell proliferation in 
conjunction with lowering NRF2 protein content (Figures 1A, B and S1B–D). In contrast, 
KEAP1-WT NSCLC lines were only marginally affected by NRF2-knockdown (Figures 1A 
and S1E). Depletion of NRF2 in the KEAP1-mutant NSCLC line H2122 also led to a 
marked reduction in glutathione and a concomitant rise in cytosolic H2O2 compared to 
KEAP1-WT H1975 cells. (Figure S1F, G).
We next mapped cysteine reactivities in KEAP1-mutant (H2122) and KEAP1-WT (H1975) 
NSCLC lines following shRNA-mediated knockdown of NRF2 (shNRF2) using the isoTOP-
ABPP platform, which employs a broadly reactive iodoacetamide alkyne (IA-alkyne, 1) 
probe for labeling, enriching, and quantifying cysteine residues in proteomes (Weerapana et 
al., 2010) (Figure S1H). We evaluated cells at early (24, 48 h) time points following NRF2 
knockdown (Figure S1I) to minimize changes in cysteine reactivity that may have been 
indirectly caused by proliferation defects. We defined NRF2-regulated cysteines as those 
showing ≥ 2.5-fold changes in reactivity in shNRF2 cells compared to control shRNA 
(shGFP) cells (i.e., isoTOP-ABPP Ratio (R) ≥ 2.5 for shGFP/shNRF2) and found that 156 
cysteines of > 3000 total quantified cysteines in H2122 cells satisfied this criterion (Figure 
1C and Table S1). Approximately three times as many NRF2-regulated cysteines were 
observed on day 2 versus day 1 post-NRF2 knockdown in H2122 cells (Figure S1J), which 
may reflect a proportional increase in changes caused by NRF2-regulated gene/protein 
expression (see below). In contrast, NRF2 depletion had minimal effects on cysteine

 reactivity in H1975 cells (Figure 1C and Table S1). We also noted that several cysteines with 
prominent changes in shNRF2-H2122 cells were not detected in H1975 cells, likely 
reflecting that the proteins harboring these cysteines are themselves regulated by NRF2 (see 
below). We further evaluated changes in cysteine reactivity in NSCLC cells caused by other 
anti-proliferative mechanisms – specifically treatment with the general kinase inhibitor 
staurosporine or the EGFR inhibitor AZD9291 – neither of which caused substantive 
changes in cysteine reactivity in KEAP1-mutant or KEAP1-WT cells (Figures S1K–M and 
Table S1). These results indicate that NRF2 disruption produces specific and widespread 
alterations in cysteine reactivity in KEAP1-mutant NSCLC cells.
NRF2-regulated cysteines were found in proteins from many different functional classes 
(Figure 1D). In instances where all quantified cysteines for a given protein were altered in 
shNRF2-H2122 cells, we concluded that the changes reflected an alteration in protein 
expression. In contrast, if only one of multiple cysteines for a given protein had a substantial 
reduction in IA-alkyne-reactivity (R ≥ 2.5), with the other quantified cysteines remaining 
constant (R < 1.5), we concluded that the change was reactivity-based. We supplemented 
this analysis by determining changes in gene expression in shNRF2- versus shGFP-H2122 
cells by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) (Table S2), which provided an expression estimate for 
proteins that contained only one quantified IA-alkyne-reactive cysteine. By combining our 
proteomic and gene expression analysis, we determined that ~80% of all changes in cysteine 
reactivity reflected alterations in protein abundance following NRF2-knockdown, with the 
remaining ~20% identified as alterations in reactivity (Figure 1E and Table S1). Proteins 
harboring cysteines that underwent specific reactivity changes in shNRF2-H2122 cells were 
found in central pathways that include glycolysis (GAPDH), protein folding (PDIA3), 
protein translation (EEF2), and mitochondrial respiration (UQCRC1) (Figure 1F). An 
example of a protein showing expression changes in shNRF2-H2122 cells was the canonical 
NRF2-regulated protein SQSTM1 (Figure 1G). None of these cysteines were affected by 
NRF2 knockdown in H1975 cells (Figure S1M).
A recent cysteine proteomics study performed in Kras-mutated mouse pancreatic cancer 
organoids deleted for NRF2 expression identified several redox-regulated cysteines (Chio et 
al., 2016). We noted, however, a minimal overall overlap (~3%) in NRF2-regulated cysteines 
in our results compared to this previous study, which may reflect differences in the mode of 
NRF2 activation (KEAP1 mutations versus Kras/p53 mutations) tumor of origin (NSCLC 
versus pancreatic), species (human versus mouse), and/or method of assigning changes in 
cysteine reactivity (fold-change versus statistical).
The NRF2-regulated cysteines in PDIA3 (C57) and GAPDH (C152) are catalytic residues, 
designating them as candidate sites for NRF2 control over fundamental biochemical 
pathways in cancer cells. Another quantified cysteine outside of the GAPDH active site – 
C247 (Figure 1F) – was unaltered in reactivity by NRF2 knockdown (Figure 1F), and we 
confirmed that GAPDH protein expression was unaffected in shNRF2 cells by 
immunoblotting (Figure 1H). C152 in GAPDH is a redox-sensitive residue that is subject to 
S-sulphenylation (Yang et al., 2014) and S-sulfhydration (Shestov et al., 2014) and can be 
affected by pharmacologically induced forms of oxidative stress (Yun et al., 2015). To our 
knowledge, however, the regulation of C152 by NRF2 has not been previously reported.

 Consistent with the conserved catalytic function performed by C152, shNRF2-H2122 cells, 
but not shNRF2-H1975 cells, showed a significant decrease in GAPDH activity (Figure 1I). 
NRF2 knockdown also produced reductions in basal glycolysis and maximal glycolytic rate 
that were more substantial in magnitude in H2122 cells compared to H1975 cells (Figure 
1J). These results thus illuminate a post-translational mechanism by which NRF2 preserves 
the functional state of a catalytic cysteine to support GAPDH activity and glycolysis in 
cancer cells.
Mapping cysteine ligandability in KEAP1-WT and KEAP1-mutant NSCLC cells
We next investigated the ligandability of cysteines in NRF2-regulated proteins by 
performing competitive isoTOP-ABPP of proteomes from three KEAP1-mutant (H2122, 
H460 and A549) and three KEAP1-WT (H1975, H2009 and H358) NSCLC lines with two 
electrophilic fragments – 2 and 3 (Figure 2A) – that showed broad cysteine reactivity in 
previous studies (Backus et al., 2016). We refer to these compounds as ‘scout’ fragments 
capable of providing a global portrait of covalent small molecule-cysteine interactions in 
native biological systems.
From a total of ~9700 cysteines quantified across the proteomes of six NSCLC lines, ~1100 
scout fragment-sensitive, or ‘liganded’, cysteines were identified (Figure 2A and S2A–B, 
and Table S3). We next overlayed this ligandability map with the fraction of proteins 
showing changes in cysteine reactivity and/or gene expression in shNRF2 cells (Figure S2C 
and Table S2), resulting in the identification of ~120 NRF2-regulated proteins with liganded 
cysteines (Figure 2B). These proteins populated diverse metabolic and signaling pathways 
known to be modulated by NRF2 (Figure 2C), but most were observed in both KEAP1-
mutant and KEAP1-WT cells (Figures 2D and S2D), indicating that NRF2 influenced, but 
did not strictly control the expression of these proteins in NSCLCs. Opposing this general 
profile was a much more restricted subset of liganded proteins that were exclusive to 
KEAP1-mutant cells (Figures 2D and S2D). These proteins included NR0B1 (liganded at 
C274), CYP4F11 (liganded at C45), and AKR1B10 (liganded at C299) (Figures 2D and 
S2D), which we confirmed by RNA-seq and western blotting were all decreased following 
knockdown of NRF2 in KEAP1-mutant NSCLC cells (Figures 2E and S2E–F).
A broader survey of gene expression across > 30 NSCLC lines confirmed the remarkably 
restricted expression of NR0B1, CYP4F11, and AKR1B10 to KEAP1-mutant cells (Figures 
3A and S3A). This expression profile was confirmed by western blotting (Figure S3B) and 
was also observed in primary human lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) tumors (Figure 3B). 
NR0B1 and AKR1B10 have been shown to be important for the proliferation of certain 
cancers (Garcia-Aragoncillo et al., 2008; Kinsey et al., 2009; Oda et al., 2009; Wang et al., 
2009), including KEAP1-mutant NSCLC cells (Oda et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2009). The 
role of CYP4F11 in cancer cell growth has not, to our knowledge, been examined. 
Consistent with past work, we found that shRNA knockdown of NR0B1 and AKR1B10 
impaired the three-dimensional growth of H460 (Figure 3C) and H2122 cells (Figure S3C). 
Similar effects were observed for CYP4F11 (Figures 3C and S3C). We also found that 
CRISPR-mediated knockout of NR0B1 or CYP4F11 in H460 cells strongly reduced colony

 formation (Figures 3D–E). Efforts to generate CRISPR knockout cells lacking AKR1B10 
were unsuccessful.
In summary, by integrating chemical proteomic maps of scout fragment reactivity with 
differential expression profiles, we identified ligandable proteins selectively expressed by 
and important for the growth of KEAP1-mutant NSCLCs.
NR0B1 nucleates a transcriptional complex that supports the NRF2 gene network
Considering the general druggability of enzymes and their key role in managing cellular 
redox homeostasis, it is perhaps not surprising that enzymes like AKR1B10 and CYP4F11 
comprised a major portion of the NRF2-regulated ligandability map. We also noted that 
most of these enzymes, as well as other NRF2-regulated genes and proteins, were expressed 
broadly across many human tissues (Figure S3C). NR0B1, however, stood out as a striking 
contrast, being an atypical orphan nuclear receptor with very limited normal tissue 
expression (Figure S3C). Structural studies have shown that NR0B1 possesses a very 
shallow pocket in place of the typical ligand-binding domain found in other nuclear 
receptors, indicating that NR0B1 may function as a “ligandless” adaptor or co-regulatory 
protein (Sablin et al., 2008). Consistent with this premise, NR0B1 acts as a transcriptional 
repressor of the nuclear receptors SF1 and LRH1 and supports development of Lydig and 
Serotoli cells in mice (Iyer and McCabe, 2004). Mutations in the NR0B1 gene lead to 
adrenal hypoplasia congenita (AHC) in human males (Iyer and McCabe, 2004). The 
biochemical and cellular functions of NR0B1 in human cancer and in particular, KEAP1-
mutant cancer cells, however, remain poorly understood.
We first assessed whether NR0B1 acts as a transcriptional regulator in KEAP1-mutant 
NSCLC cells. RNAseq analysis identified more than >2500 genes that were substantially 
altered (1.5-fold) in expression in shNR0B1 H460 cells (Table S2), and ~30% of these genes 
were located near transcriptional start sites (TSSs) bound by NR0B1 as determined by 
chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) (Figure 4A and Table S2). These 
results suggest that many of the NR0B1-regulated genes in NSCLC cells are in open 
chromatin under direct transcriptional control of NR0B1. Unbiased functional enrichment 
analysis (Huang da et al., 2009) revealed an overrepresentation of cell cycle-related and pro-
proliferation functions in genes reduced in expression in shNR0B1 NSCLC cells (Figure 
S4A and Table S2) that included, for instance, strong E2F and Myc gene signatures (Figure 
S4B). RNAseq analyses further revealed a substantial correlation in global gene expression 
changes induced by knockdown of NR0B1 or NRF2 in NSCLC cells (Figure 4B and Table 
S2), with > 50% of the genes with substantially altered (> 1.5 fold) expression in shNR0B1 
cells showed a similar magnitude directional change in shNRF2 cells (Figure 4B). Among 
the most co-downregulated genes were those involved in proliferation and DNA metabolism/
replication (Figure 4C), consistent with the enrichment of these terms in the NR0B1-
regulated gene set (Figure S4B).
Considering the established function of NR0B1 as a coregulatory protein that participates in 
nuclear receptor complexes (Iyer and McCabe, 2004; Sablin et al., 2008), we hypothesized 
that NR0B1 may interact with other proteins to regulate transcriptional pathways in KEAP1-
mutant cancer cells. We expressed a FLAG epitope-tagged form of NR0B1 in KEAP1-

 mutant NSCLC cells, immunoprecipitated NR0B1 from these cells, and identified associated 
proteins by mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics. Eleven proteins were substantially 
co-enriched (> 20-fold) with NR0B1 compared to a control protein METAP2 (Figure S4C 
and Table S1). A subset of these proteins, including RBM45 and SNW1, were also 
confirmed by MS-based proteomics to interact with endogenous NR0B1 (Figure 4D). Stably 
expressed FLAG-SNW1 and FLAG-RBM45, but not a control protein (FLAG-RAP2A), 
interacted with NR0B1 in multiple NSCLC cells (Figures 4E and S4D), and both SNW1 and 
RBM45, like NR0B1, were localized to the nucleus of NSCLC cells (Figure S4F). SNW1 
did not directly interact with RBM45 in the absence of NR0B1 (Figure S4E), indicating that 
NR0B1 bridges these two proteins to nucleate a multimeric protein complex (Figure 4E). 
While very little is known about RBM45, SNW1 has been implicated as a transcriptional 
activator (Zhang et al., 2003) and found to interact with multiple nuclear receptors, including 
NR0B1, in large-scale yeast two-hybrid assays (Albers et al., 2005). Consistent with this 
role and with a coordinated function for SNW1 and NR0B1 in KEAP1-mutant cancer cells, 
RNAi-mediated knockdown of SNW1 produced a similar set of gene expression changes to 
those observed in shNR0B1 cells (Figure S4G and Table S2). SNW1 knockdown also 
blocked the anchorage independent growth of KEAP1-mutant NSCLC cells (Figure S4H).
Covalent small molecules that disrupt NR0B1 protein interactions
The liganded cysteine in NR0B1 – C274 – is located within a conserved “repression helix” 
that commonly possesses a LXXLL sequence in other nuclear receptors, but, in NR0B1, has 
been replaced by a PCFXXLP sequence, where the “C” is C274 (Sablin et al., 2008). 
Missense mutations within this general region of NR0B1 have been found to cause AHC 
(Suntharalingham et al., 2015) (Figure 5A), pointing to an important functional role for the 
repression helix. The hydrophobic residues in the repression helix of NR0B1, including 
C274, are solvent-exposed and appear to contribute to protein-protein interactions (Sablin et 
al., 2008) (Figure 5A), suggesting that ligands targeting C274 might disrupt NR0B1 protein 
complexes.
We next aimed to develop a more advanced chemical probe targeting C274 of NR0B1. 
Using an in vitro binding assay (Figure 5B), we screened an ~80-member library of 
cysteine-reactive electrophilic compounds (Table S3) (Backus et al., 2016) at 50 μM for 
blockade of interactions between endogenous NR0B1 and recombinant FLAG-SNW1 in cell 
lysates (Figure 5C). Among the hits (> 50% blockade) were a series of N-disubstituted 
chloroacetamides (CAs), including BPK-26 (Figure 5D, E), that were selected for further 
investigation. The initial structure-activity relationship indicated more tolerance to 
substitution of the N-aryl compared to N-benzyl group of BPK-26, including a hit BPK-28 
where the N-aryl group was replaced with an azepane group with only modest reductions in 
potency (Figure S5A). Modifications to BPK-28, including installation of a morpholine 
group, generated compound BPK-29 (Figure 5D) that recovered potency (Figures 5E and 
S5B). Both BPK-26 and BPK-29 inhibited the NR0B1-SNW1 interaction with IC50 values 
between 10–20 μM in vitro (Figure S5C). The initial screen also identified structurally 
related, inactive control compounds – BPK-9 and BPK-27 (Figure 5C, D) – that did not 
inhibit the NR0B1-SNW1 interaction across a tested concentration range of 1–50 μM 
Bar-Peled et al.

 (Figures 5E and S5C). Finally, we confirmed by LC-MS/MS analysis that BPK-26 and 
BPK-29 covalently modified C274 of NR0B1 (Figures S5D, E and Table S3).
We also synthesized an alkyne analogue of BKP-29 (BPK-29yne) and found that this probe 
labeled WT-NR0B1, but not a C274V mutant (Figure 5G), and this labeling was blocked by 
pre-treatment with BPK-29 in a concentration dependent manner (Figures 5G and SF5). The 
C274V-NR0B1 mutant maintained binding to SNW1, but this protein-protein interaction 
was not sensitive to BPK-26 or BPK-29, supporting that these ligands disrupt the NR0B1 
protein-protein interactions by covalently modifying C274 (Figures 5G and S5G).
Cellular studies with NR0B1 ligands
IsoTOP-ABPP confirmed the cellular engagement of C274 of NR0B1 by BPK-26 and 
BPK-29 in NSCLC cells (Figure 6A and Tables 1 and S3), with both compounds achieving 
~70% target occupancy when tested at 40 μM for 3 h (Figures 6A and S6A). In contrast, the 
inactive control compounds BPK-9 and BPK-27 did not engage C274 (Figure 6A and Tables 
1 and S3). Nine additional cysteines among the > 1500 total cysteines quantified by isoTOP-
ABPP cross-reacted with BPK-26 and/or BPK-29 in NSCLC cell proteomes (Figures 6A, B 
and Tables 1 and S3), and most of these cysteines also reacted with the control compounds 
(Figures 6B and Tables 1 and S3). NR0B1 was the only target shared between BPK-26 and 
BPK-29 that did not cross-react with the control compounds (Figures 6B and Table 1). C274 
was also the only cysteine in NR0B1 engaged by BPK-26 and BPK-29 among several other 
quantified cysteines (Figure S6B). BPK-29 displayed superior potency compared to 
BPK-26, achieving > 50% engagement of C274 at 5 μM in NSCLC cells (Figure S6A). We 
finally employed the BPK-29yne probe to further characterize the protein targets of BPK-29 
in NSCLC cells following the chemical proteomic workflow outlined in Figure S6C, which 
verified most of the targets mapped by isoTOP-ABPP and revealed another seven proteins 
engaged by BPK-29, all of which also cross-reacted with the control compounds (Tables 1 
and S3). Taken together, these data indicate that BPK-26 and BPK-29 substantially engage 
NR0B1 with good overall proteomic selectivity in KEAP1-mutant NSCLCs.
We asked next asked whether BPK-26 and BPK-29 inhibited NR0B1 protein interactions in 
cells using two complementary systems. First, we generated KEAP1-null HEK293T cells 
and found that these cells show elevated expression of NR0B1 (Figure S6D). KEAP1-null 
HEK293T cells, or KEAP1-mutant NSCLC cells, were then engineered to stably express 
FLAG-tagged RMB45 or SNW1 and treated with BPK-26 and BPK-29 or inactive control 
compounds. In both cell systems, BPK-26 and BPK-29, but not control compounds, blocked 
the interactions of FLAG-tagged RMB45 or SNW1 with endogenous NR0B1 (Figures 6C 
and S6E–F). BPK-29 blocked NR0B1-protein interactions with better potency than BPK-26 
(Figures 6D and S6G).
Based on its superior in situ activity (Figures 6D and S6A, G) and selectivity (Figure 6A, B), 
BPK-29 was chosen for additional biological studies. Treatment of KEAP1-mutant NSCLC 
cells with BPK-29 (5 μM) blocked colony formation in soft agar (Figures 6E and S7A). 
Control compounds BPK-9 and BPK-27 had much less of an effect (Figures 6E and S7A). 
Exogenous expression of WT or a C274V mutant of NR0B1 significantly, albeit partially 
rescued the growth inhibition caused by BPK-29 (Figure 6F). In contrast, BPK-29 (5 μM),

 or NR0B1 knockdown, minimally affected the anchorage-independent growth of KEAP1-
WT NSCLC cells (Figure S7B–C).
BPK-29 (30 μM, 12 h) also produced some of the gene expression changes caused by 
shRNA-mediated disruption of NR0B1 or NRF2 in KEAP1-mutant NSCLC cells (Figure 
S7D, Table S2), including reductions in CRY1, DEPDC1, and CPLX2 (Figures S7E–F), 
which were not observed in KEAP1-WT NSCLC cells treated with BPK-29 (Figure S7E). 
We further confirmed that BPK-29-treated cells also showed a substantial reduction in CRY1 
protein content (Figure S7G). These gene and protein expression changes were not observed 
in KEAP1-mutant NSCLC cells treated with control compound BPK-9 (Figures S7D–G).
In the course of studying the cellular activity of BPK-29, we were perplexed by the 
relatively shallow concentration-dependent change in engagement of C274 of NR0B1 
compared to other targets of the compound (Figure S6A). Covalent ligands like BPK-29 
engage proteins in a time-dependent manner, which led us to speculate that differences in 
protein turnover rate in cells could affect the maximal absolute engagement of NR0B1 by 
BPK-29. We accordingly performed SILAC pulse-chase chemical proteomics experiments in 
Keap1-mutant NSCLC cells, which revealed that NR0B1 was among a select subset of 
NRF2-regulated proteins that exhibit rapid turnover in NSCLC cells (Figure 6G and Table 
S1). These fast-turnover proteins generally corresponded to those that displayed early time 
point changes in protein abundance in our original isoTOP-ABPP analysis of shNRF2 cells 
(Figure 6H and Table S1). Similar results were obtained in KEAP1-mutant NSCLC cells 
treated with cycloheximide, which provided a half-life estimate for NR0B1 of ~4.8 h (Figure 
S7H). These findings demonstrate that NR0B1 is a short half-life protein in KEAP1-mutant 
NSCLC cells, possibly explaining its rapid decrease following NRF2 disruption (Table S1) 
and substantive, but incomplete engagement by BPK-29 in cells (Figures 6A and S6A). 
More generally, our chemical proteomic data highlight how NRF2 can exert strict temporal 
and coordinated control over proteins in cancer cells by integrated transcriptional and post-
translational mechanisms.
Discussion
Oncogenic pathways alter the biochemical state of cancer cells to promote unregulated 
growth and survival. The extent to which genetically defined cancers depend on such 
biochemical alterations may create druggable vulnerabilities, an outcome that is especially 
relevant for oncogenes like NRF2 that have proven difficult to directly target with 
established therapeutic modalities. Here we have used chemical proteomics to discover 
proteins harboring cysteine residues that are both regulated by NRF2 and targeted by 
electrophilic small molecules. By using a pair of scout fragments found previously to show 
broad reactivity with cysteines across the human proteome (Backus et al., 2016), we 
simplified the search for ligandable cysteines in NSCLC lines, and we anticipate that this 
approach should facilitate the discovery of druggable site in other biological systems. Some 
of the liganded cysteines discovered in KEAP1-mutant cells, such as the catalytic 
nucleophiles of GADPH and PDIA3, were regulated post-translationally by NRF2, 
indicating that this transcription factor establishes a redox environment conducive to proper 
cysteine-dependent enzyme function in NSCLC cells. NRF2 disruption may also produce

 post-translational effects that indirectly regulate cysteine reactivity, such as changes in the 
structure of protein complexes or non-redox-related protein modifications (e.g., 
phosphorylation). GAPDH and PDIA3, as well as most of the other NRF2-regulated 
proteins discovered in our chemical proteomic analysis, however, are broadly expressed in 
human tissues, leading us to question their suitability as co-dependency targets specific to 
NRF2-dependent NSCLCs. The atypical orphan nuclear receptor NR0B1 stood out, 
however, as a notable exception, as it displayed a much more restricted expression profile 
that was tightly linked to the KEAP1/NRF2 mutational state of NSCLCs. NR0B1 was also 
among the most rapidly downregulated proteins in shNRF2 NSCLC cells, and we found this 
portion of the NRF2-regulated proteome was enriched in fast-turnover proteins. We 
speculate that coupling NRF2 transcription to rapid protein turnover provides cancer cells 
with a mechanism to tightly coordinate the functions of proteins like NR0B1.
Our findings furnish a model where NR0B1 promotes the expression of a specific subset of 
NRF2-regulated genes that are enriched in pro-proliferative functions, including genes that 
regulate the cell cycle and DNA synthesis. NR0B1 may serve a similar function in cancers 
that depend on other oncogenic transcription factors, such EWS/FLI-1-dependent Ewing’s 
sarcoma, where NR0B1 knockdown also suppresses cell growth and cell cycle-related gene 
expression (Garcia-Aragoncillo et al., 2008).
Considering that NR0B1 lacks a clear ligand-binding pocket, this protein may act primarily 
as a coregulatory protein to affect transcription (Iyer and McCabe, 2004). We identified 
multiple proteins (RBM45, SNW1) that interact with NR0B1 in KEAP1-mutant NSCLC 
cells and found that covalent ligands reacting with C274 of NR0B1 block these protein-
protein interactions. Mutation of C274 to valine fully protected NR0B1 protein complexes 
from covalent ligand action, but only partially rescued the growth blockade caused by these 
compounds. Potential reasons for this difference include a non-equivalent function for the 
C274V-NR0B1 mutant in NSCLC cells and/or that the covalent ligands impair cancer cell 
growth by a combination of NR0B1-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Further 
optimization of the potency and selectivity of NR0B1 ligands should enable more advanced 
biological studies, where we expect that the rapid resynthesis rate of the protein will present 
an additional challenge for covalent ligands targeting C274. NR0B1 has been shown to 
display a short half-life in other cell systems (Ehrlund et al., 2009), suggesting that this 
property is an intrinsic feature of the protein. Nonetheless, we are emboldened by the 
successful development of cysteine-reactive ligands that target other proteins with short half-
lives, where optimization of the pharmacokinetic properties of the covalent drugs proved 
critical (Thorarensen et al., 2017).
In summary, our studies have identified key transcriptional and post-translational 
mechanisms by which NRF2 regulates the proteome of human NSCLC cells. Recent studies 
have also revealed that NRF2 can control the translation machinery of mouse pancreatic 
tumor cells to promote the expression of key drivers of proliferation (Chio et al., 2016). 
While it is possible that the modulation of general cell processes, such as translation, 
glycolysis, and protein folding, by NRF2 may provide an expanded therapeutic window for 
agents that disrupt these core functions in NRF2-activated cancers, such approaches are 
ultimately predisposed to affect many cells in the body. Proteins like NR0B1, which show a

 much more restricted expression profile aligned with NRF2 activation, present a potentially 
attractive alternative. Further work is needed, however, to determine whether ligands that 
disrupt NR0B1 function can impede NRF2-dependent cancer growth in vivo, either 
independently or in combination with other targeted therapies. Beyond oncology, NR0B1 
plays an important role in testicular and adrenal gland development, where it appears to 
engage in a distinct set of protein-protein interactions that involve LRH1 and SF1 (Iyer and 
McCabe, 2004; Sablin et al., 2008; Suntharalingham et al., 2015). These interactions, as well 
as mutations that cause congenital adrenal hypoplasia (Suntharalingham et al., 2015) involve 
the repression helix region of NR0B1 containing C274, indicating that the ligands reported 
herein may serve as useful chemical probes to understand NR0B1 function in mammalian 
development and other cell biological processes. More generally, our results underscore the 
value of emerging chemical proteomic methods for mapping ligandable sites in human 
proteins (Backus et al., 2016; Niphakis et al., 2015), in this case, unveiling a cysteine in the 
protein-protein interaction domain of a transcriptional regulator that is amenable to covalent 
inactivation by small-molecule electrophiles.

with 5% CO2. HEK-293T cells were grown in DMEM (Corning) supplemented with 10% 
fetal bovine serum (FBS, Omega Scientific), penicillin (100 U/ml), streptomycin (100 
μg/ml) and L-glutamine (2 mM). H2122, H460, A549, H1975, H358, H1792, and H2009 
cells were grown in RPMI-1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented as above. H2009 cells were 
additionally supplemented with Insulin-Transferrin-Selenium (Invitrogen). For SILAC 
experiments, each cell line was passaged at least six times in SILAC RPMI (Thermo), which 
lack L-lysine and L-arginine, and supplemented with 10% (v/v) dialyzed FBS (Gemini), 
penicillin, streptomycin, L-glutamine (as above), and either [13C6, 15N2]-L-lysine and 
[13C6, 15N4]-L-arginine (100 mg/mL each) or L-lysine and L-arginine (100 mg/mL each). 
Heavy and light cells were maintained in parallel and cell aliquots were frozen after six 
passages in SILAC media and stored in liquid N2 until needed. Whenever thawed, cells were 
passaged at least three times before being used in experiments.

shRNA-encoding plasmids were co-transfected with ΔVPR envelope and CMV VSV-G 
packaging plasmids into 2.5 × 106 HEK-293T cells using the Xtremegene 9 transfection 
reagent (Sigma-Aldrich). Virus-containing supernatants were collected forty-eight hours 
after transfection and used to infect target cells in the presence of 10 μg/ml polybrene (Santa 
Cruz). Twenty-four hours post-infection, fresh media was added to the target cells which 
were allowed to recover for an additional twenty-four hours. Puromycin was then added to 
cells, which were analyzed immediately or on the 2nd or 3rd day after selection was added.
Generation of CRISPR-mediated knockout HEK-293T cell lines—sgRNAs 
targeting KEAP1 or NRF2 (described below) were designed, amplified, and cloned into 
transient pSpCas9-2A-Puro (Addgene, PX459). 1 × 106 HEK-293T cells were transfected 
with the pSpCa9-2A-Puro plasmid containing sgRNAs targeting KEAP1 or NRF2. 
Following puromycin selection, clonal cells were isolated by flow cytometry and analyzed

Mammalian lentiviral cDNA expression—Mammalian lentiviral particles harboring 
cDNA-encoding plasmids were generated as described above, with the exception that the 
viral supernatant was concentrated with LentiX (Clontech) prior to infection of target cells. 
Cells were allowed to recover for 24 h followed by continuous selection with puromycin.
Identification of NR0B1 interacting proteins—Confluent 15 cm dishes of A549 
stably or transiently expressing FLAG-NR0B1 or FLAG-METAP2, were rinsed with ice-
cold PBS and were sonicated in the presence of Chaps IP buffer (0.3% Chaps, 40mM Hepes 
pH 7.4, 50mM KCl, 5mM MgCl2 and EDTA-free protease inhibitors (Sigma)). Following 
lysis, samples were clarified by centrifugation for 10 min at 16,000 × g. FLAG-M2 beads 
(100 μL, 50:50 slurry) was added to the clarified supernatant and incubated for 3 h while 
rotating at 4°C. Beads were washed once with Chaps IP buffer and three times with Chaps 
IP buffer supplemented with 150 mM NaCl. Proteins were eluted with the FLAG peptide 
(sequence DYKDDDDK) from the FLAG-M2 beads, run on a 4–20% Tris-glycine gel 
(Invitrogen) and stained with InstantBlue (Expedeon). Each lane was cut into 10 pieces and 
in-gel trypsin (Promega) digestion was performed. The resulting digests were analyzed by 
liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). MS2 spectra data were 
extracted from the raw file using RAW Convertor (version 1.000; available at http://
fields.scripps.edu/downloads.php). MS2 spectra data were searched using the ProLuCID

 algorithm (publicly available at http://fields.scripps.edu/downloads.php) using a reverse 
concatenated, non-redundant variant of the Human UniProt database (release-2012_11). 
Cysteine residues were searched with a static modification for carboxyamidomethylation 
(+57.02146) and one differential modification for oxidized methionine (+15.9949). Spectral 
counts for proteins from FLAG-NR0B1 immunoprecipitates were compared to spectral 
counts for proteins from FLAG-METAP2 immunoprecipitates across 5–6 biological 
replicates. Interacting proteins were classified as those proteins whose corresponding 
peptides were enriched by greater that 20-fold in FLAG-NR0B1 immunoprecipitates 
compared to FLAG-METAP2 immunoprecipitates.
For identification of endogenous NR0B1 interacting proteins, A549, H2122 or H460 cell 
lysates were prepared as described above. The NR0B1 (Cell Signaling Technology), RagC 
(Cell Signaling Technology) or GAPDH (Santa Cruz) antibodies were added to each lysate 
and incubated with rotation at 4°C for 1.5 h. Subsequently, protein G sepharose beads (50 
μL, 50:50 slurry) were added to each sample and incubated for an additional 1.5 h. Beads 
were washed as described above and proteins were eluted with 8M urea at 30°C for 1 h. 
Proteins were reduced by treatment with DTT (10 mM for 30 min at 65 °C) and cysteines 
were alkylated with iodoacetamide (20 mM for 30 min at 37°C). Urea was diluted to 2M and 
proteins were digested with 2 μg of Trypsin (Promega). The resulting digests were analyzed 
by mass spectrometry as described below.
Co-transfection based interaction experiments—For transfection experiments, 4 × 
106 HEK-293T cells were plated in a 10 cm dish. The next day, cells were transfected with 
the pRK5-based cDNA expression plasmids indicated in the figures in the following 
amounts. Figure S4: 25 ng FLAG-RBM45, 100 ng FLAG-NR0B1, 200 ng HA-SNW1; 
Figure 5 and S5: for in-vitro binding experiments: 5000 ng FLAG-SNW1; for in vitro 
binding experiments with transiently transfected NR0B1: 25 ng HA-NR0B1 or HA-NR0B1-
C274V; for fluorescence experiments: 5000 ng Flag-NR0B1 or 5000 ng FLAG-NR0B1-
C274V; Figure 5S: for site of labeling experiments, 5000 ng FLAG-NR0B1. Following 
transfections, cells were grown for 48 h and processed as described below.
Compound treatment for assessment of protein-protein interactions—
Confluent 10 cm plates of indicated cell lines were rinsed once with warm PBS and 
incubated in serum/dye-free RPMI with indicated compounds or vehicle for 3 h at 37 °C. 
Cells were washed once ice-cold PBS and snap frozen.
Cell lysis and Immunoprecipitations—Cells were rinsed once with ice-cold PBS, and 
lysed by sonication in Triton IP buffer. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 16,000 × g 
for 10 min. Samples were normalized to 1 mg ml−1 and boiled following the addition of 
sample buffer. For FLAG- or HA-immunoprecipitations, FLAG or HA resins (30 μL, 50:50 
slurry) were added to the pre-cleared lysates and incubated with rotation for 3 hours at 4°C. 
Following immunoprecipitation, the beads were washed once with IP buffer followed by 3 
times with IP buffer containing 500mM NaCl. Loading buffer (40 μL) was added to the 
immunoprecipitated proteins which were subsequently denatured by boiling. Proteins were 
resolved by SDS-PAGE, analyzed by immunoblotting and relative band intensities were 
quantified using ImageJ software.

 In vitro binding assay—H2122 clarified cell lysate (100 μL, 1 mg ml−1) in IP-buffer 
were incubated with the indicated compounds or vehicle (DMSO) for 3 hours at 4°C with 
rotation. Following treatment, 3 volumes of IP-buffer was added along with immobilized 
FLAG-SNW1 beads (30 μL, 50:50 slurry), which was incubated for an additional hour at 
4°C. Beads were washed three times with IP-buffer supplemented with 500 mM NaCl. 
Immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by 
immunoblotting. NR0B1 and HA-NR0B1 levels were determined by using the NR0B1 
antibody (Cell Signaling). IC50 curves were determined using Prism 6 (Graphpad) software, 
with maximum and minimum values set at 100% NR0B1 bound 0% NR0B1 bound 
respectively.
Immunofluorescence—Samples were prepared as described in (Bar-Peled et al., 2013). 
In brief, 1 × 105 A549 cells stably expressing FLAG-RBM45 or FLAG-SNW1 were plated 
on poly-lysine coated glass coverslips in 12-well tissue culture plates. Forty-eight hours 
later, the culture media was removed and cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde 
(Electron microscopy services). The slides were rinsed three times with PBS and cells were 
permeabilized with 0.05% Triton X-100 in PBS for 1 min. The slides were rinsed four times 
with PBS and incubated with primary antibodies in 5% normal donkey serum (Thermo) 
overnight at 4°C. After rinsing four times with PBS, the slides were incubated with 
secondary antibodies conjugated to the indicated fluorophores (Invitrogen) for 1 h at room 
temperature. Following an additional four washes with PBS, the slides were stained with 
Hoechst (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Slides were mounted on glass 
coverslips using Prolong Gold® Antifade reagent (Invitrogen) and imaged on Zeiss LSM 
780 laser scanning confocal microscope. Images were processed using ImageJ software.
Measurement of glycolytic flux—Cells were plated on poly-L-lysine coated 96-well 
Seahorse plates (Seahorse Biosciences) after lentiviral infection with shNRF2 or shGFP and 
equilibrated for 1 h in DMEM (Sigma D6030) containing 2 mM glutamine in the absence of 
serum and glucose. Basal extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) was then analyzed in the 
Seahorse XFe96 flux analyzer (Seahorse Biosciences), followed by ECAR measurements 
after sequential injections of 10 mM glucose, 2 μM oligomycin and 100 mM 2-
deoxyglucose (2-DG).
Measurement of intracellular glutathione levels—H2122 or H1975 cells expressing 
shRNAs targeting a control or NRF2 were cultured in 6-well plates and total cellular 
glutathione content was determined using the Glutathione Assay Kit (Cayman Chemical) 
following the manufacturer’s protocol. Absorbance from GSH reaction with DTNB was 
measured using a Biotek Synergy 2 microplate reader (Biotek).
Measurement of GAPDH activity—2.5 × 105 H2122 or H1975 cells expressing 
shRNAs targeting a control or NRF2 were cultured in 6-well plates and GAPDH activity 
was determined using Ambion KDalert GAPDH Assay Kit (Fisher) following the 
manufacture’s protocol. This assay measures the conversion of NAD+ to NADH by GAPDH 
in the presence of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. The rate of NADH production correlated to

 an increase in fluorescence was measured by using a Biotek Synergy 2 microplate reader 
(Biotek).
Measurement of cytosolic hydrogen peroxide levels—Cytosolic hydrogen peroxide 
was measured using the Peroxyfluor-6 acetoxymethyl ester (PF6-AM) fluorescent probe as 
described in (Dickinson et al., 2011). In brief, cells were washed twice with warm PBS and 
incubated with 250 nM of PF6-AM in serum-free RPMI for 20 min at 37°C. Cells were 
allowed to recover in complete RPMI for 1 h and were subsequently harvested and 
resuspended in sorting buffer (PBS + 1% FBS). Flow cytometry acquisition was performed 
with BD FACSDiva™-driven BD™ LSR II flow cytometer (Becton, Dickinson and 
Company) which measured the increase in PF6-AM fluorescence. Data was analyzed with 
FlowJo software (Treestar Inc.)
Monolayer proliferation assay—Cells were cultured in 96-well plates at 3 × 103 cells 
per well in 100 μl of RPMI. At the indicated time points 50 μl of Cell Titer Glo reagent 
(Promega) was added to each well and the luminescence read on a Biotek Synergy 2 
microplate reader (Biotek).
Anchorage-independent growth assay—Multiple NSCLC cell lines were tested for 
their ability to form colonies in soft agar. H460 cells were seeded at concentrations between 
0.75–3.0 × 104 cells/well of a 6-well plate. H2122 cells were seeded at concentration 
between 4.0–6.0 × 104 cells/well. H2009 anchorage-independent growth was substantially 
poorer and required a higher concentration of cells (1 × 105 cells/well) to form colonies. For 
comparison of cells expressing indicated shRNAs cells were infected with virus-containing 
supernatants as described in Mammalian lentiviral shRNAs expression. 48 h after 
puromycin selection cells were seeded for experiment. For comparison of H460 cells 
expressing exogenous cDNAs, cells expressing the luciferase protein were infected with 
virus-containing supernatants as described in Mammalian lentiviral cDNA expression. 
CRISPR-mediated knockout cell lines were generated as described in Generation of 
CRISPR-mediated knockout H460 cell lines. An equal number of cells from each 
comparison group was embedded in a solution of 0.4% Noble agar solution (Difco Labs) 
and placed on top of hardened layer of 0.6% agar in a 6-well plate. For comparison of cells 
treated with indicated compound versus DMSO, compound (5 μM) or DMSO was added to 
cells in the 0.4% Noble agar solution before solidification. Cells were grown for 6–20 days 
at 37°C with 5% CO2. Fresh media (200 μL) was added every 5 days. Colony formation was 
determined by either counting colonies or bioluminescent imaging using an IVIS Spectrum 
(Caliper Life Science). Luciferin was added to cells and bioluminescence was quantified by 
measuring photon flux (photons/sec) using Living Image 3.2 software (Caliper Life Science) 
(Goodwin et al., 2014) and normalized to cells treated with vehicle (DMSO) or expressing 
shGFP.
qPCR analysis—2.5 × 105 cells/well of a 6-well plate were seeded the night before 
treatment. Cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of compound as denoted in 
the figure legends for 12 h. Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen) 
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. cDNA amplification was preformed using iScript

 Reverse Transcription Supermix kit (Bio-Rad). qPCR primer sequences were obtained from 
PrimerBank (https://pga.mgh.harvard.edu/primerbank/) (Wang et al., 2012) and are listed 
below. qPCR analysis was performed on a ABI Real Time PCR System (Applied 
Biosystems) with the SYBR green Mastermix (Applied Biosystems). Relative gene 
expression was normalized to the 18S gene.

Gel-based competition of BPK-29yne labeling of NR0B1—4 × 106 HEK-293T cells 
were seeded in poly-L-lysine coated 10 cm plates and transfected the next day with 5 μg of 
FLAG-NR0B1, FLAG-NR0B1-C274V, or FLAG-METAP2 cDNA in a pRK5-based 
expression vector. 48 h after transfection, cells were treated with indicated concentrations of 
BPK-29 or control compound BPK-27 for 3 h at 37 °C in DMEM containing 10% FBS and 
supplements as described in Cell Culture. BPK-29yne (5 μM) was then added and 
incubated for an additional 30 min at 37 °C. FLAG immunoprecipitates were prepared as 
described above and following washes, the FLAG resin was resuspended in PBS (100 μL). 
To each sample, 12 μL of a freshly prepared “click” reagent mixture was added to conjugate 
the fluorophore to probe-labeled proteins. CuAAC reaction mixture consisted of TAMRA 
azide (1 μL of 12.5 mM stocks in DMSO, final concentration = 125 μM), 1 mM tris(2-
carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP; 2 μL of fresh 50 × stock in water, final 
concentration = 1mM), ligand (6 μL 17× stock in DMSO:t-butanol 1:4, final concentration = 
100 μM) and 1 mM CuSO4 (2 μL of 50x stock in water, final concentration = 1 mM). Upon 
addition of the click mixture, each reaction was immediately mixed by vortexing and then 
allowed to react at ambient temperature for 1 h before quenching the reactions with 100 μL 
of loading buffer. Samples were boiled for 5 min and proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE 
(10% acrylamide), and visualized by in-gel fluorescence on a Bio-Rad ChemiDoc MP 
flatbed fluorescence scanner. Samples were also analyzed by immunoblotting. 
Recombinantly expressed FLAG-tagged protein levels were determined with the FLAG 
antibody (Sigma). Gel fluorescence and imaging was processed using Image Lab (v 5.2.1) 
software.
Measurement of NR0B1 degradation—7.5–8 × 105 H460 cells were seeded the night 
before per well of a 6-well plate. Cells were treated with cycloheximide (100 μg/mL) for the 
indicated time points. Cells were rinsed in ice-cold PBS, scraped on ice and processed for

 immunoblot analysis as described above. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, analyzed by 
immunoblotting and NR0B1 band intensities were quantified using ImageJ software and 
compared to a loading control (Beta-actin or GAPDH).
RNA sequencing—RNA was isolated by RNeasy Kit (Qiagen) and digested with DNase 
(Qiagen) from n=3 samples per condition (cells expressing shGFP, shNRF2_1, shNR0B1_1 
or shSNW1_1 or treated with DMSO, 30 μM BPK-29 or 30 μM BPK-9). RNA integrity 
(RIN) numbers were determined using the Agilent TapeStation prior to library preparation. 
mRNA-seq libraries were prepared using the TruSeq RNA library preparation kit (version 2) 
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Illumina). Libraries were then quantified, 
pooled, and sequenced by single-end 50 base pairs using the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform 
at the Salk Next-Generation Sequencing Core. Raw sequencing data were demultiplexed and 
converted into FASTQ files using CASAVA (version 1.8.2). Libraries were sequenced at an 
average depth of 15 million reads per sample.
The spliced read aligner STAR (Dobin et al., 2013) was used to align sequencing reads to 
the human hg19 genome. Gene-level read counts were obtained based on UCSC hg19 gene 
annotation. DESeq2 (Love et al., 2014) was used to calculate differential gene expression 
based on uniquely aligned reads, and p-values were adjusted for multiple hypothesis testing 
with the Benjamini-Hochberg method.
ChIP-seq analysis—ChIP was conducted as previously described (Komashko et al., 
2008). H460 cells were fixed in 1% formaldehyde (Sigma) for 15 minutes at 25 °C. After 
lysis, samples were sonicated using a biorupter sonicator (Diagenode) for 60 cycles (30 
seconds per cycle/30 seconds cooling) at a high power level. Chromatin sheering was 
optimized to a size range of 200 to 600 bp. Chromatin (100 μg) was immunoprecipitated 
with the NR0B1 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology). For DNA sequencing, samples were 
prepared for library construction, flow cell preparation and sequencing were performed 
according to Illumina’s protocols. Sequencing was accomplished on Illumina HiSeq 2500 
using PE 2 × 125 bp reads with over 14 million clusters per sample.
Sequencing reads were aligned to the hg19 genome using bowtie2 (Langmead and Salzberg, 
2012). Peak detection was carried out using HOMER (homer.ucsd.edu), comparing the 
NR0B1 IP sample against a whole-cell extract (WCE) with default parameters for 
transcription factor-style analysis. This requires relevant peaks to be significantly enriched 
over WCE and the local region with an uncorrected Poisson distribution-based p-value 
threshold of 0.0001 and false discovery rate threshold of 0.001. These peaks were further 
restricted to a 2kb window around annotated transcription start sites.
Correlation analysis—For shRNA gene expression analysis data, the correlation of gene 
expression levels between the shNR0B1-cells and shNRF2-cells and shNR0B1-cells and 
shSNW1-cells was calculated using Pearson’s correlation coefficient, and a correlation 
analysis was performed to calculate the p-value.
Circos plot—A graphical summary of NR0B1 genome-wide effects. The inner track shows 
the change in gene expression following NR0B1 knockdown (red indicates an increase, blue

 a decrease). The middle track shows the normalized peak height of the NR0B1 ChIP. Only 
genes with both significantly altered expression (adjusted p-value threshold of 0.01 and 1.5-
fold expression threshold) and an NR0B1 peak near a TSS are shown.
A graphical summary of liganded cysteines in KEAP1-WT and KEAP1-mutant cell lines. 
The outer track denotes total liganded cysteines in a given cell line (cysteines were defined 
as liganded if they had an average R ≥5 and were quantified in two or more replicates). Grey 
chords connect liganded cysteines that are found in two or more cell lines.
GSEA—GSEA (Subramanian et al., 2005) was carried out using pre-ranked lists from FDR 
or fold change values, setting gene set permutations to 1000 and using either c1 collection in 
MSigDB version 4.0 (Figure S4C) or c2 collection in MSigDB V.5.0 (Figure S7A).
Functional Gene Enrichment Analysis—Functional enrichment in gene sets was 
determined using the DAVID functional annotation tool (version 6.7) with “FAT” Gene 
Ontology terms (Huang da et al., 2009).
isoTOP-ABPP Sample preparation—Sample preparation and analysis were based on 
(Backus et al. 2016.) with modifications noted below.
For analysis of NR0B1 ligands or control compound reactivity, H460 cells or H460 cells 
expressing luciferase in a 10 cm plate were incubated with indicated compounds in serum/
dye-free RPMI for 3 hours at 37 °C. Cells were washed once ice-cold PBS and lysed in 1% 
Triton X-100 dissolved in PBS with protease inhibitors (Sigma) by sonication. Samples were 
clarified by centrifugation for 10 min at 16,000 × g. Lysate was adjusted to 1.5 mg ml−1 in 
500 μL.
For analysis of cysteines regulated by NRF2, H2122 or H1975 cells expressing shGFP or 
shNRF2 were lysed and processed as described above. Lysate was adjusted to 1.5 mg ml−1 
in 500 μL.
For analysis of cysteines that change following induction of apoptosis, H2122 and H1975 
cells were treated with DMSO or staurosporine (1 μM, 4 h) in full RPMI. H1975 cells were 
treated with DMSO or AZD9291 (1 μM, 24 h) in full RPMI. Cells were lysed as described 
above.
For analysis of ligandable cysteines in KEAP1-WT (H2122, H460 and A549) cells and 
KEAP1-mutant (H1975, H2009 (expressing the luciferase protein) and H358) cells, lysate 
was prepared as described in (Backus et al., 2016). Samples were treated with 500 μM of 
compound 2, 3 or vehicle for 1 h at room temperature.
isoTOP-ABPP IA-alkyne labeling and click chemistry—Samples were labeled for 1 
h at ambient temperature with 100 μM iodoacetamide alkyne (1, IA- alkyne, 5 μL of 10 mM 
stock in DMSO). Samples were conjugated by copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition 
(CuAAC) to isotopically labeled, TEV-cleavable tags (TEV-tags). Heavy CuAAC reaction 
mixtures was added to the DMSO-treated or shGFP control samples and light CuAAC 
reaction mixture was added to compound-treated or shNRF2 samples. The CuAAC reaction

 mixture consisted of TEV tags (light or heavy, 10 μL of 5 mM stocks in DMSO, final 
concentration = 100 μM), 1 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP; fresh 
50 × stock in water, final concentration = 1mM), ligand (17x stock in DMSO:t-butanol 1:4, 
final concentration = 100 μM) and 1 mM CuSO4 (50x stock in water, final concentration = 1 
mM). The samples were allowed to react for 1 h at which point the samples were centrifuged 
(16,000 × g, 5 min, 4°C). The resulting pellets were sonicated in ice-cold methanol (500 μL) 
and the resuspended light- and heavy-labeled samples were then combined pairwise and 
centrifuged (16,000 × g, 5 min, 4°C). The pellets were solubilized in PBS containing 1.2% 
SDS (1 mL) with sonication and heating (5 min, 95°C) and any insoluble material was 
removed by an additional centrifugation step at ambient temperature (14,000 × g, 1 min).
isoTOP-ABPP streptavidin enrichment—For each sample, 100 μL of streptavidin-
agarose beads slurry (Fisher) was washed in 10 mL PBS and then resuspended in 6 mL PBS 
(final concentration 0.2% SDS in PBS). The SDS-solubilized proteins were added to the 
suspension of streptavidin-agarose beads and the bead mixture was rotated for 3 h at ambient 
temperature. After incubation, the beads were pelleted by centrifugation (1,400 × g, 3 min) 
and were washed (2 × 10 mL PBS and 2 × 10 mL water).
isoTOP-ABPP trypsin and TEV digestion—The beads were transferred to eppendorf 
tubes with 1 mL PBS, centrifuged (1,400 × g, 3 min), and resuspended in PBS containing 6 
M urea (500 μL). To this was added 10 mM DTT (25 μL of a 200 mM stock in water) and 
the beads were incubated at 65 °C for 15 mins. 20 mM iodoacetamide (25 μL of a 400 mM 
stock in water) was then added and allowed to react at 37°C for 30 mins with shaking. The 
bead mixture was diluted with 900 μL PBS, pelleted by centrifugation (1,400 × g, 3 min), 
and resuspended in PBS containing 2 M urea (200 μL). To this was added 1 mM CaCl2 (2 
μL of a 200 mM stock in water) and trypsin (2 μg, Promega, sequencing grade) and the 
digestion was allowed to proceed overnight at 37 °C with shaking. The beads were separated 
from the digest with Micro Bio-Spin columns (Bio-Rad) by centrifugation (1,000 × g, 1 
min), washed (2 × 1 mL PBS and 2 × 1 mL water) and then transferred to fresh eppendorf 
tubes with 1 mL water. The washed beads were washed once further in 140 μL TEV buffer 
(50 mM Tris, pH 8, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT) and then resuspended in 140 μL TEV 
buffer. 5 μL TEV protease (80 μM) was added and the reactions were rotated overnight at 
29 °C. The TEV digest was separated from the beads with Micro Bio- Spin columns by 
centrifugation (1,400 × g, 3 min) and the beads were washed once with water (100 μL). The 
samples were then acidified to a final concentration of 5% (v/v) formic acid and stored at 
−80°C prior to analysis.
isoTOP-ABPP liquid-chromatography-mass-spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis—
Samples processed for multidimensional liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry 
(MudPIT) were pressure loaded onto a 250 μm (inner diameter) fused silica capillary 
columns packed with C18 resin (Aqua 5 μm, Phenomenex). Samples were analyzed using an 
LTQVelos Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) coupled to an Agilent 1200- 
series quaternary pump. The peptides were eluted onto a biphasic column with a 5 μm tip 
(100 μm fused silica, packed with C18 (10 cm) and bulk strong cation exchange resin (3 cm, 
SCX, Phenomenex,)) in a 5-step MudPIT experiment, using 0%, 30%, 60%, 90%, and 100%

 salt bumps of 500 mM aqueous ammonium acetate and using a gradient of 5–100% buffer B 
in buffer A (buffer A: 95% water, 5% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid; buffer B: 5% water, 
95% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid) as has been described in (Weerapana et al., 2007). Data 
were collected in data-dependent acquisition mode with dynamic exclusion enabled (20 s, 
repeat of 2). One full MS (MS1) scan (400–1800 m/z) was followed by 30 MS2 scans 
(ITMS) of the nth most abundant ions.
isoTOP-ABPP peptide and protein identification—The MS2 spectra data were 
extracted from the raw file using RAW Convertor (version 1.000; available at http://
fields.scripps.edu/downloads.php). MS2 spectra data were searched using the ProLuCID 
algorithm (publicly available at http://fields.scripps.edu/downloads.php) using a reverse 
concatenated, non-redundant variant of the Human UniProt database (release-2012_11). 
Cysteine residues were searched with a static modification for carboxyamidomethylation 
(+57.02146) and up to two differential modification for either the light or heavy TEV tags or 
oxidized methionine (+464.28595, +470.29976, +15.9949 respectively).
MS2 spectra data were also searched using the ProLuCID algorithm using a custom database 
containing only selenocysteine proteins, which was generated from a reverse concatenated, 
nonredundant variant of the Human UniProt database (release-2012_11). In the database, 
selenocysteine residues (U) were replaced with cysteine (C) and were searched with a static 
modification for carboxyamidomethylation (+57.02146) and up to two differential 
modification for either the light or heavy TEV tags or oxidized methionine (+512.2304+ or 
+518.2442 +15.9949). Peptides were required to have at least one tryptic terminus and to 
contain the TEV modification. ProLuCID data was filtered through DTASelect (version 2.0) 
to achieve a peptide false-positive rate below 1%.
isoTOP-ABPP R value calculation and processing—The isoTOP-ABPP ratios (R 
values) of heavy/light for each unique peptide (DMSO/compound treated or shGFP/
shNRF2) were quantified with in-house CIMAGE software (Weerapana et al., 2010) using 
default parameters (3 MS1 acquisitions per peak and signal to noise threshold set to 2.5). 
Site-specific engagement of cysteine residues was assessed by blockade of IA-alkyne probe 
labelling. A maximal ratio of 20 was assigned for peptides that showed a ≥95% reduction in 
MS1 peak area from the experimental proteome (light TEV tag) when compared to the 
control proteome (DMSO, shGFP; heavy TEV tag). Ratios for unique peptide sequences 
entries were calculated for each experiment; overlapping peptides with the same modified 
cysteine (for example, different charge states, MudPIT chromatographic steps or tryptic 
termini) were grouped together and the median ratio is reported as the final ratio (R). 
Additionally, ratios for peptide sequences containing multiple cysteines were grouped 
together. Biological replicates of the same treatment and cell line were averaged if the 
standard deviation was below 60% of the mean; otherwise, for cysteines with at least one R 
value <4 per treatment, the lowest value of the ratio set was taken. For cysteines where all R 
values were ≥ 4, the average was reported. The peptide ratios reported by CIMAGE were 
further filtered to ensure the removal or correction of low-quality ratios in each individual 
data set. The quality filters applied were the following: removal of half tryptic peptides; 
removal of peptides which were detected only once across all data sets reported herein; 
Bar-Peled et al.

 removal of peptides with R = 20 and only a single MS2 event triggered during the elution of 
the parent ion; manual annotation of all the peptides with ratios of 20, removing any 
peptides with low-quality elution profiles that remained after the previous curation steps.
For selenocysteines, the ratios of heavy/light for each unique peptide (DMSO/compound 
treated; isoTOP-ABPP ratios, R values) were quantified with in-house CIMAGE software 
using the default parameters described above, with the modification to allow the definition 
of selenocysteine (amino acid atom composition and atomic weights). Extracted ion 
chromatograms were manually inspected to ensure the removal of low quality ratios and 
false calls.
Cysteine residues were deemed to have significantly changed following NRF2 knockdown if 
they had R-values ≥ 2.5. Changes in cysteine reactivity were considered reactivity based if a 
cysteine for a given protein had an R-value ≥ 2.5 and all the remaining cysteines in that 
protein had R-values < 1.5. If only one cysteine was identified per protein with an R value ≥ 
2.5, and if the corresponding change in the mRNA transcript was < 1.5 (shGFP/shNRF2) 
then that change was also considered reactivity based. Changes in cysteine reactivity were 
considered expression based if a cysteine for a given protein had an R-value ≥ 2.5 and all the 
remaining cysteines in that protein had R-values ≥ 1.5. If only one cysteine was identified 
per protein with an R-value ≥ 2.5, and if the corresponding change in the mRNA transcript 
was ≥ 1.5 (shGFP/shNRF2) then than change was also considered expression based. For 
datasets corresponding to changes in cysteine reactivity in H2122 cells expressing shNRF2 
or shGFP at ‘Day1/2’ two replicates were taken from the ‘Day 1’ time point and three 
replicates were taken from the ‘Day 2 time point’ (Table S1). For datasets corresponding to 
changes in cysteine reactivity in H1975 cells expressing shNRF2 or shGFP at ‘Day1/2’ two 
replicates were taken from the ‘Day 1’ time point and two replicates were taken from the 
‘Day 2 time point’ (Table S1). For datasets corresponding to changes in cysteine reactivity in 
H2122 cells expressing shNRF2 or shGFP at ‘Day1’ three replicates were used (Table S1). 
Cysteine residues were designated as expression-based changes for this experiment if 
following NRF2 knockdown they had R-values ≥ 2.5 and were considered unchanged if they 
had R-values < 1.5 (Table S1). Cysteines were considered significantly changed following 
staurosporine or AZD9291 treatment if they had R values ≥ 2.5.
Cysteine residues were considered liganded in vitro by electrophilic fragments (compounds 
2 or 3) if they had an average R-value ≥ 5 and were quantified in at least 2 out of 3 
replicates. Targets of NR0B1 ligands or control compounds were defined as those cysteine 
residues that had R-values ≥ 3 in more than one biological replicate following ligand 
treatment in cells.
Protein turnover—For analysis of protein turnover in H460 cells, confluent 10 cm plates 
were washed twice with warm PBS, then incubated in “heavy” RPMI for 3 h. Cells were 
washed once ice-cold PBS and lysed in 1% Triton 100-X dissolved in PBS with protease 
inhibitors (Sigma) by sonication. Lysate was adjusted to 1.5 mg ml−1 in 2 × 500 μL. 
Samples were processed identically to other samples (lysates were adjusted to 1.5 mg ml−1 
in 2 × 500 μL), with the following modification: only isotopically light TEV tag was used. 
After the “click” reaction, both 2 × 500 μL were centrifuged (16,000 × g, 5 min, 4°C) and

 resuspended by sonication in ice-cold methanol (500 μL). Aliquots were then combined and 
resolubilized in PBS containing 1.2% SDS (1 mL) as detailed in isoTOP-ABPP IA-alkyne 
labeling and click chemistry. Samples were further processed and analyzed as detailed in: 
isoTOP-ABPP streptavidin enrichment, isoTOP-ABPP trypsin and TEV digestion, 
isoTOP-ABPP liquid-chromatography-mass-spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis, isoTOP-
ABPP peptide and protein identification and isoTOP-ABPP R value calculation and 
processing with the following exceptions: Samples processed for protein turnover were 
searched with ProLuCID with mass shifts of SILAC labeled amino acids (+10.0083 R, 
+8.0142 K) in addition to carboxyamidomethylation modification (+57.02146) and two 
differential modification for either the light TEV tag or oxidize methionine (+464.28595, 
+15.9949 respectively). 1 peptide identification was required for each protein. ProLuCID 
data was filtered through DTASelect (version 2.0) to achieve a peptide false-positive rate 
below 1%. Ratios of light/heavy peaks were calculated using in-house CIMAGE software. 
Median SILAC ratios from one or more unique peptides were combined to generate R 
values. Proteins were required to be quantified in at least two biological replicates. The 
mean R values and standard deviation for multiple biological experiments were calculated 
from the average ratios from each replicate. Proteins were designated as rapid turnover if 
they had R-values ≤ 8.
ABPP-SILAC sample preparation and LC-MS analysis—Isotopically labeled H460 
cell lines were generated as described above. Light and heavy cells were treated with 
compounds (20 μM) or DMSO, respectively, for 3 h, followed by labeling with the 
BPK-29yne (5 μM) for 30 min. Cells were washed once ice-cold PBS and lysed in 1% 
Triton 100-X dissolved in PBS with protease inhibitors (Sigma) by sonication. Lysate was 
adjusted to 1.5 mg ml−1 in 500 μL. Samples were conjugated by CuAAC to Biotin-PEG4-
azide (5 μL of 10 mM stocks in DMSO, final concentration = 100 μM). CuAAC “click” mix 
contained TCEP, TBTA ligand and CuSO4 as detailed for isoTOP-ABPP sample 
preparation. Samples were further processed as detailed in: isoTOP-ABPP streptavidin 
enrichment and isoTOP-ABPP trypsin TEV digestion with the following exception: after 
overnight incubation at 37 °C with trypsin, tryptic digests were separated from the beads 
with Micro Bio-Spin columns (Bio-Rad) by centrifugation (1,000 × g, 1 min). Beads were 
rinsed once with water (200 μL) and combined with tryptic digests. The samples were then 
acidified to a final concentration of 5% (v/v) formic acid and stored at −80°C prior to 
analysis. Samples were processed for multidimensional liquid chromatography tandem mass 
spectrometry (MudPIT) as described in isoTOP-ABPP liquid-chromatography-mass-
spectrometry (LC-MS) with the exception that peptides were eluted using the 5-step 
MudPIT protocol with conditions: 0%, 25%, 50%, 80%, and 100% salt bumps of 500 mM 
aqueous ammonium acetate and using a gradient of 5–100% buffer B in buffer A (buffer A: 
95% water, 5% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid; buffer B: 5% water, 95% acetonitrile, 0.1% 
formic acid).
ABPP-SILAC peptide and protein identification and R value calculation and 
processing—The MS2 spectra data were extracted and searched using RAW Convertor 
and ProLuCID algorithm as described in isoTOP-ABPP peptide and protein 
quantification. Briefly, cysteine residues were searched with a static modification for

 carboxyamidomethylation (+57.02146 C). Searches also included methionine oxidation as a 
differential modification (+15.9949 M) and mass shifts of SILAC labeled amino acids 
(+10.0083 R, +8.0142 K) and no enzyme specificity. Peptides were required to have at least 
one tryptic terminus and unlimited missed cleavage sites. 2 peptide identifications were 
required for each protein. ProLuCID data was filtered through DTASelect (version 2.0) to 
achieve a peptide false-positive rate below 1%. Ratios of heavy/light (DMSO/test 
compound) peaks were calculated using in-house CIMAGE software. Median SILAC ratios 
from two or more unique peptides were combined to generate R values. The mean R values 
and standard deviation for multiple biological experiments were calculated from the average 
ratios from each replicate. Targets of NR0B1 ligands or control compounds were defined as 
those proteins that had R-values ≥2.5 in two or more biological replicates following ligand 
treatment in cells.
Site of labeling—For site of labeling with BPK-29, 4 × 106 HEK-293T cells were seeded 
in a 10 cm plate and transfected the next day with 5 μg of FLAG-NR0B1 cDNA in a pRK5-
based expression vector. 48 hours after transfection, cells were treated with vehicle, BPK-29 
(50 μM) in serum-free RPMI for 3 h at 37 °C. FLAG immunoprecipitates were prepared as 
described above in Identification of NR0B1 interacting proteins. FLAG-NR0B1 was 
eluted from FLAG-M2 beads with 8M urea and subjected to proteolytic digestion, 
whereupon tryptic peptides harboring C274 were analyzed by LC-MS/MS. The resulting 
mass spectra were extracted using the ProLuCID algorithm designating a variable peptide 
modification (+252.986 and +386.1851 for BPK-26 and BPK-29, respectively) for all 
cysteine residues. For site of labeling with BPK-26, HEK-293T cell lysate transfected with 
FLAG-NR0B1 as described above was treated with vehicle or BPK-26 (100 μM) for 3 h at 
4°C. FLAG immunoprecipitates were processed for proteomic analysis as described above. 
See Table S3 for MS/MS spectra and fragmentation tables.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Statistical analysis was preformed using GraphPad Prism version 6 or 7 for Mac, GraphPad 
Software, La Jolla California USA, www.graphad.com or the R statistical programing 
language (www.R-project.org). Statistical values including the exact n and statistical 
significance are also reported in the Figure Legends. Inhibition curves of the NR0B1-SNW1 
interactions by NR0B1-ligand are fit as using log(inhibitor) vs % normalized remaining of 
NR0B1-SNW1 interaction and data points are plotted as the mean ± SD (n=2–5 per group). 
NR0B1 half-life was calculated from a one-phase exponential decay curve plotted as mean ± 
SD (4–10 per group). Statistical significance was defined as p< 0.05 and determined by 2-
tailed Student’s t-test (Figure 1I, S1D, 3B, 3C–F, 6E–F, S3C, S4H, S7A), two-way Anova 
with Bonferroni post-test analysis (Figure 1J) or correlation analysis using Pearson product-
moment correlation coefficient (Figures 4B, S4G).

 Figure 4. NR0B1 nucleates a transcriptional complex that supports the NRF2 gene-expression 
program
A) Intersection between NR0B1-regulated genes and transcriptional start sites (TSSs) bound 
by NR0B1. Outer circle: Chromosomes with cytogenetic bands. Middle circle: Whole 
genome plot of mapped NR0B1 reads (black) determined by ChIP-Seq corresponding to the 
transcriptional start sites (TSSs) of genes differentially expressed (up- (blue) or down- (red) 
regulated > 1.5-fold) in shNR0B1-H460 cells compared to shGFP-H460 cells (inner circle). 
See also Table S2.
B) Overlap (left) and correlation (right) between genes up- (red) or down- (blue) regulated 
(> 1.5-fold) in shNR0B1- and shNRF2-H460 cells compared to shGFP-H460 control cells. r 
and p values were determined by Pearson correlation analysis.
C) Heat map depicting RNAseq data for the indicated genes in shNR0B1-, shNRF2-, or 
shGFP-H460 cells. Expression was normalized by row. See also Table S2.
D) Heat map representing NR0B1-interacting proteins in NSCLC cells.
E) Endogenous NR0B1 co-immunoprecipitates with FLAG-RBM45 and FLAG-SNW1, but 
not control protein FLAG-RAP2A, in H460 cells, as determined by immunoblotting (left);

 Figure 5. A covalent ligand targeting C274 disrupts NR0B1 protein complexes
A) Co-crystal structure of mouse NR0B1 (white) and LRH1 (burnt orange) from (Sablin et 
al., 2008) highlighting the location of C274 (orange) at the protein interaction interface that 
is also flanked by AHC mutations: R267, V269 and L278 (red).
B) Left: Schematic for an NR0B1-SNW1 in vitro-binding assay. Right: immunoblot 
showing that NR0B1 interacts with SNW1, but not a control (METAP2) protein.
C) Small molecule screen of electrophilic compounds (50 μM) for disruption of binding of 
FLAG-SNW1 to NR0B1 as shown in (B). Percentage of NR0B1 bound to SNW1 was 
normalized to vehicle (DMSO). A hit compound BPK-26 is marked in red.
D) Structures of NR0B1 ligands (BPK-26 and BPK-29), clickable probe (BPK-29yne), and 
inactive control compounds (BPK-9 and BPK-27).
E) BPK-26 and BPK-29, but not BPK-9 and BPK-27, disrupt the in vitro interaction of 
FLAG-SWN1 with NR0B1.
F) BPK-29yne labels WT-NR0B1, but not an NR0B1-C274V mutant. HEK293T cells 
expressing the indicated proteins were treated with BPK-29 or vehicle (3 h) prior to 
treatment with BPK-29yne (30 min). Immunoprecipiated proteins were analyzed by in-gel 
fluorescence-scanning and immunoblotting.
G) BPK-29 disrupts protein interactions for NR0B1-WT, but not a NR0B1-C274V mutant. 
HEK293T cells expressing HA-NR0B1-WT or HA-NR0B1-C274V proteins were treated 
with DMSO or BPK-29, after which lysates were generated and evaluated for binding to 
FLAG-SNW1, as shown in (B).

 Figure 6. Characterization of NR0B1 ligands in KEAP1-mutant NSCLC cells
A) isoTOP-ABPP of H460 cells treated with NR0B1 ligands and control compounds (40 
μM, 3 h). Dashed lines designate R values ≥ 3 (DMSO/compound), which was used as a 
cutoff to define cysteines liganded by the indicated compounds. Insets show MS1 profiles 
for C274 in NR0B1 for DMSO (blue) versus compound (red) treatment. Data are from 
individual experiments representative of at least three biological replicates.
B) Venn diagram comparing the proteome-wide selectivity of NR0B1 ligands BPK-29 and 
BPK-26 and control compounds BPK-9 and BPK-27 in H460 cells as determined in (A). 
(See also Tables 1 and S3).
C) BPK-29 and BPK-26 block the RBM45-NR0B1 interaction in H460 cells. H460 cells 
stably expressing FLAG-RBM45 were incubated with indicated compounds for 3 h, 
whereupon FLAG immunoprecipitates were performed and analyzed by immunoblotting.
D) Concentration-dependent blockade of NR0B1 binding to FLAG-RBM45 by BPK-29 
(left) and BPK-26 (right) in H460 cells. Experiments performed as described in (C).
E) Effect of BPK-29 and control compounds (5 μM) on anchorage-independent growth of 
KEAP1-mutant H460 cells. Representative brightfield images (top) and quantification 
(bottom) of cell growth. Data represent mean values ± SD (n = 4–8 per group) and are 
representative of two to four biological replicates; ****p < 0.0001 for BPK-29 vs BPK-9 or 
BPK-27. Scale bar equals 0.75 mm.
F) Ectopic expression of NR0B1-WT or NR0B1-C274V, but not control protein (RAP2A) 
partially and significantly rescues the impairment in anchorage-independent growth 
produced by BPK-29 (5.7 μM) in H460 cells expressing luciferase. Proliferation was 
determined by colony counting and data represent mean values ± SD (n = 3/group) and 
representative of at least two biological replicates; ****p < 0.0001 for FLAG-Rap2a, 
BPK-29 vs FLAG-NR0B1-C274, BPK-29; ***p < 0.001 for FLAG-RAP2A, BPK-29 vs 
FLAG-NR0B1-WT, BPK-29. Bottom: Immunoblot showing expressed NR0B1 (or RAP2A 
control) proteins.

 G) SILAC ratio plots for light amino acid-labeled cells (pulse phase) switched into media 
containing heavy amino acids for 3 h (chase phase) followed by proteomic analysis. Dashed 
line designates R values (light/heavy) of < 8, which was used as a cutoff for fast-turnover 
proteins. Inset shows MS1 peak ratio for NR0B1, which is among the top 5% of fast-
turnover proteins. See also Table S1.
H) Proteins regulated by NRF2 in NSCLC cells are enriched in fast-turnover proteins. 
Charts comparing fraction of NRF2-regulated genes (as determined by RNAseq) for which 
the corresponding proteins are designated as fast or slow turnover (as determined in G) 
further divided into groups showing reduced expression (left) or not (right) on day 1 
following NRF2 knockdown (as determined by isoTOP-ABPP). See also Table S1.
