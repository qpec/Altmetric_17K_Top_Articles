SUMMARY
Many studies have explored how neuromodulators
affect synaptic function, yet little is known about
how they modify computations at the microcircuit
level. In the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN), a region
that integrates auditory and multisensory inputs
from two distinct pathways, serotonin (5-HT) en-
hances excitability of principal cells, predicting a
generalized reduction in sensory thresholds. Surpris-
ingly, we found that when looked at from the circuit
level, 5-HT enhances signaling only from the multi-
sensory input, while decreasing input from auditory
fibers. This effect is only partially explained by an
action on auditory nerve terminals. Rather, 5-HT
biases processing for one input pathway by simulta-
neously enhancing excitability in the principal cell
and in a pathway-specific feed-forward inhibitory
interneuron. Thus, by acting on multiple targets,
5-HT orchestrates a fundamental shift in representa-
tion of convergent auditory and multisensory path-
ways, enhancing the potency of non-auditory signals
in a classical auditory pathway.
INTRODUCTION
Convergence of inputs from multiple sensory modalities, multi-
sensory integration, is believed to enhance perceptual sensi-
tivity and selectivity, thereby improving detection, localization,
and orientation toward specific environmental cues (Stein and
Stanford, 2008). During this selective process, context- and
state-dependent patterns of neuromodulator release (e.g.,
acetylcholine, serotonin, dopamine, or norepinephrine) may re-
configure multisensory circuits, guiding behavior in adaptive
ways (Froemke et al., 2013; Kayser et al., 2008; Mu et al.,
2012; Parikh et al., 2007; Pinto et al., 2013). Serotonin (5-HT) in
particular affects diverse physiological and behavioral functions
(Lucki, 1998), and dysfunction of 5-HT signaling is implicated in a
variety of psychiatric disorders (Huot et al., 2011; Meltzer et al.,
1998). Despite evidence that 5-HT powerfully influences sensory
processing (Brunert et al., 2016; Correia et al., 2017; Hurley and
Pollak, 2005; Kapoor et al., 2016; Wood et al., 2013), it is unclear
how 5-HT regulates the convergence of inputs in multisensory
circuits.
The dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) is a well-established site of
sensory integration, critical for sound source localization and
orientation to sounds of interest (Imig et al., 2000; May, 2000;
Oertel and Young, 2004; Sutherland et al., 1998). The layout of
input pathways is clear and can be readily accessed using
in vitro preparations (Figure 1A). Fusiform principal cells receive
two distinct glutamatergic inputs: auditory input from auditory
nerve fibers (ANFs) terminating on their basal dendrites (Brown
and Ledwith, 1990; Ryugo and May, 1993; Smith and Rhode,
1985) and diverse multisensory input from parallel fibers (PFs)
that terminate on their apical dendrites (Babalian, 2005; Davis
et al., 1996; Itoh et al., 1987; Mugnaini et al., 1980; Shore
et al., 2000; Weinberg and Rustioni, 1987; Zhou and Shore,
2004). The inhibitory microcircuits of the DCN are well character-
ized. ANF and PF inputs drive spiking in several subpopulations
of inhibitory interneurons, notably vertical cells (also called tuber-
culoventral cells) (Rhode, 1999; Zhang and Oertel, 1993a) and
cartwheel cells (Berrebi and Mugnaini, 1991; Golding and Oertel,
1997; Zhang and Oertel, 1993b), respectively, and these inter-
neurons directly synapse on fusiform cells, thereby providing
modality-specific feed-forward inhibition. The DCN receives a
dense serotonergic input, originating predominantly from the
dorsal and medial raphe nuclei (Klepper and Herbert, 1991;
Steinbusch, 1981; Thompson and Thompson, 2001; Thompson
et al., 1994, 1995; Willard et al., 1984). This anatomy therefore
provides a foundation for understanding serotonergic modula-
tion of multisensory integration. Importantly, aberrant 5-HT
signaling is implicated in tinnitus, a condition associated with hy-
peractivity of the DCN (Simpson and Davies, 2000; Wu et al.,
2016). Understanding the physiological basis of 5-HT modula-
tion of the DCN may thus provide an insight into mechanisms un-
derlying tinnitus.
A mouse brain slice preparation was developed that preserved
both ANF- and PF-driven microcircuits, to determine whether
and how 5-HT regulates the convergence of auditory and
multisensory inputs in the DCN. We found that 5-HT differentially
targets auditory and multisensory components of the micro-
circuit, biasing the response of fusiform cells toward multisen-
sory transmission. This is accomplished predominantly by a
facilitating action on hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleo-
tide-gated (HCN) channels in both the fusiform cell and a
pathway-specific interneuron, the vertical cell. In this way,
the principal cell becomes consistently more responsive to

RESULTS
Pathway-Specific Effects of 5-HT on Inputs to Fusiform
Cells
We previously showed that 5-HT increases excitability of fusi-
form cells by activating HCN channels (Tang and Trussell,
2015). In the current study, we predicted that because the
enhanced excitability is postsynaptic, all excitatory synaptic
inputs should be more effective in driving the fusiform cell. We
tested this idea in vitro by recording postsynaptic potentials
and spikes in fusiform cells following 50-Hz trains of stimuli deliv-
ered to either ANFs or PFs (see Supplemental Experimental
Procedures) in the absence and presence of 5-HT (Figure 1A).
As expected (Tang and Trussell, 2015), 5-HT enhanced sponta-
neous firing of fusiform cells recorded in current-clamp (data not
shown). What was unexpected was that 10 mM 5-HT decreased
the firing probability of postsynaptic spikes triggered by stimula-
tion of ANFs (40.0% ± 9.5% decrease; p < 0.01, paired t test; n =
10; Figures 1B and 1D), yet increased the firing probability of
PF-triggered spikes (increased by 67.3% ± 22.1%; p < 0.05,
paired t test; n = 8; Figures 1C and 1E). The result of these
opposing actions was a shift in the normal balance of convergent
ANF and PF inputs toward the multisensory pathway (change
index: mean firing probability during 5-HT relative to control,
ANF: 0.60 ± 0.10, PF: 1.67 ± 0.22; p < 0.001, unpaired t test;
Figure 1F).
It seemed reasonable that the increase in PF-induced excita-
tion of fusiform cells was due to the increased postsynaptic
excitability (Tang and Trussell, 2015), and indeed 5-HT increased
spike probability of fusiform cells to PF-evoked excitatory post-
synaptic potentials (EPSPs) across a wide range of fiber stimulus
intensities (Figure S1). However, this postsynaptic change
cannot explain the decreased effectiveness of ANF input to fusi-
form cells. To determine whether 5-HT exerted a selective inhib-
itory effect specifically on auditory synapses, we recorded pairs
of excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) (termed EPSC1 and
EPSC2) in voltage-clamped fusiform cells by independently
stimulating ANFs and PFs in the presence of inhibitory synaptic
blockers (Figure 2A). Bath application of 10 mM 5-HT indeed
produced a small reduction in the amplitude of ANF EPSC1
(27.0% ± 2.8% reduction; p < 0.001, paired t test; n = 19; Figures
2B and 2C) and increased the paired-pulse ratio (PPR; EPSC2/
EPSC1) by 10.7% ± 2.9% from 0.82 to 0.90 (paired t test, p <
0.001; n = 19), suggesting that the reduction in ANF EPSCs could
be caused by a decrease in release probability. The increase in
the normalized PPR was correlated with the degree of 5-HT-
induced inhibition of ANF EPSCs (r2 = 0.21; p < 0.05; Figure 2E),
consistent with a presynaptic action of 5-HT. By contrast, 5-HT
had no effects on PF EPSCs (EPSC1: 102.0% ± 3.4% of control;
p > 0.05, n = 18; Figures 2B and 2D) or PPR (98.0% ± 1.7% of
control; p > 0.05; n = 18), and no correlation was observed
between the change in normalized PPR and the effect of 5-HT
on PF EPSC amplitude (r2 = 0.00; p = 0.98; Figure 2E). 5-HT
also reduced trains of ANF EPSCs, without affecting trains of
PF EPSCs (Figures S2A–S2D), and did not affect inward currents
evoked by direct microiontophoresis of glutamate on fusiform
cells near their basal dendrites (Figures S2E and S2F). Previous
evidence demonstrated the presence of 5-HT1A receptors
(5-HT1ARs) in the DCN (Oh et al., 1999; Thompson and Wiech-
mann, 2002; Wright et al., 1995). Indeed, we found that the
presynaptic effect of 5-HT on ANF synapses was mediated by
5-HT1ARs, because the selective agonist 8-OH-DPAT (10 mM)
reversibly decreased the EPSC1 amplitude by 32.8% ± 2.1%
(Figures 2F and 2G) and increased the PPR by 15.1% ± 5.3%
(Figure 2G). Moreover, 5-HT did not affect ANF EPSCs in the
presence of the 5-HT1AR antagonist 3 mM WAY100635 (Fig-
ure 2G). Finally, we made recordings from auditory granule cells,

 while stimulating their mossy fiber inputs (Balakrishnan and
Trussell, 2008), and did not observe significant effects of
10 mM 5-HT on the amplitude of the mossy fiber EPSCs (n = 9;
p > 0.05) or on the granule cells’ holding current (n = 14;
p > 0.05; data not shown), further supporting that the PF pathway
is not affected by 5-HT.
Pathway-Specific Enhancement of Feed-Forward
Inhibition by 5-HT
The presynaptic inhibitory effect of 5-HT on ANF EPSCs seems
to oppose the postsynaptic excitatory actions of 5-HT described
earlier, and thus cannot fully account for the inhibition of post-
synaptic spikes driven by ANF (Figure 1). Thus, we asked
whether other mechanisms might additionally reduce the impact
of ANF activity following 5-HT exposure. ANF and PF inputs not
only excite fusiform cells, but also initiate feed-forward inhibition
by way of vertical cells and cartwheel cells, respectively (Fig-
ure 1A). To address whether 5-HT could modulate synaptic
inhibition, we determined the effects of 5-HT on feed-forward
inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) in fusiform cells evoked
by ANF or PF stimuli. Feed-forward inhibition was revealed by
eliciting ANF- and PF-mediated synaptic responses in voltage-
clamped fusiform cells held at �60 mV, a voltage between the
reversal potentials for EPSCs and IPSCs (EGlu = 0 mV; ECl =
–85 mV). Typically, ANF- and PF-evoked disynaptic currents
exhibited a brief EPSC immediately followed by an IPSC; both
phases of current were completely abolished by NBQX (10 mM)
(Figure 3A), an antagonist for AMPA/kainate receptors, confirm-
ing that the inhibitory component reflects disynaptic activation of
local interneurons. Further confirmation of the disynaptic nature
of the IPSCs was seen through analysis of their latencies. EPSCs
and IPSCs were isolated by voltage clamping at their respective
reversal potentials; the latency between ANF EPSC and ANF-
triggered IPSC onsets was 1.3 ± 0.2 ms (n = 5), and the latency
between PF EPSC and PF-triggered IPSC onsets was 2.0 ±
0.1 ms (n = 7), consistent with previous studies (Doiron et al.,
2011; Sedlacek and Brenowitz, 2014). ANF-triggered IPSCs
showed depression, whereas PF-activated IPSCs showed
facilitation (Figures 3A and 3B), reflecting the short-term plas-
ticity of the excitatory ANF and PF inputs onto vertical cells
and cartwheel cells, respectively. In particular, ANF to vertical
cell excitatory inputs depress, whereas vertical cell to fusiform
cell inhibitory inputs do not (Kuo et al., 2012). Together, these
data indicate that ANF and PF inputs can drive distinct monosyn-
aptic EPSCs and disynaptic IPSCs onto fusiform cells. This disy-
naptic inhibition strongly constrained the temporal summation of
EPSCs during repetitive afferent activity (Figure 3B).
To assess the effects of 5-HT on stimulus-evoked disynaptic
IPSCs, we examined 5-HT modulation by measuring the total
outward charge in the EPSC/IPSC sequence with and without

 5-HT. 5-HT enhanced the disynaptic inhibitory current in
response to ANF stimulation, yet had no effects on the disynaptic
inhibitory current evoked by PF stimulation in fusiform cells (Fig-
ures 3B–3D; first stimulus, control: 213.3 ± 39.9 pA*ms, 5-HT:
397.5 ± 71.1 pA*ms, p < 0.01, n = 6; average of 6–10 stimuli, con-
trol: 94.0 ± 6.7 pA*ms, 5-HT: 168.0 ± 25.5 pA*ms, p < 0.05).
Moreover, 5-HT shifted the balance of excitation and inhibition
(E/I) over the entire course of the stimulus train. 5-HT decreased
the average E/I ratio for the first stimulus in a train (control: 0.68 ±
0.17, 5-HT: 0.22 ± 0.04; p < 0.05; n = 6; Figure 3D), and this
reduction was maintained throughout the train (average for
6–10 stimuli, control: 1.11 ± 0.15, 5-HT: 0.63 ± 0.15; p < 0.001)
despite ongoing synaptic depression. The decrease in inward
synaptic current likely results from a reduction of excitatory syn-
aptic transmission by activation of presynaptic 5-HT1ARs (Fig-
ure 2). Such a decrease in inward charge must contribute to

the disynaptic current evoked by PF stim-

and 3E). Thus, serotonergic modulation
of inhibition onto fusiform cells is pathway
specific.
5-HT Enhances Excitability of
Vertical Cells
To
understand
how
5-HT
selectively
enhanced inhibition during ANF stimula-
tion, we examined the effects of 5-HT on
each element of the inhibitory microcircuit. Enhanced feed-for-
ward inhibition could reflect increased excitability of vertical cells
by activation of somatodendritic 5-HT receptors, which would in
turn enable recruitment of greater numbers of vertical cells dur-
ing auditory nerve activity. Alternatively, there might be a direct
potentiation of ANF-vertical cell excitatory synapses and/or
vertical cell-fusiform cell inhibitory synapses by presynaptic
5-HT receptors. We therefore tested the effects of 5-HT on the
excitability of vertical cells, EPSCs in vertical cells evoked by
ANF stimulation, and vertical-cell-mediated IPSCs onto fusiform
cells.
Vertical cells were identified on the basis of their location and
firing pattern (Figure 4A; Kuo et al., 2012). Under current-clamp,
5-HT (10 mM) depolarized the resting membrane potential by 4.3
± 0.8 mV (p < 0.001, paired t test; n = 9; Figures 4B and 4C) in the
presence of synaptic blockers, indicating a direct postsynaptic

1847
 action of 5-HT. Accompanying the depolarization was an in-
crease of spontaneous spike activity (control: 0.48 ± 0.45 Hz,
5-HT: 13.5 ± 2.7 Hz; p < 0.001; n = 12; Figures 4B–4D). To
examine how 5-HT affects the sensitivity of vertical cells to
current stimuli, we injected a series of 0.5 s current steps into
vertical cells, starting with �20 pA and incrementing by 20 pA,
and the spike rate at each current level was measured with
and without 5-HT. 5-HT shifted the input-output relation to the
left (Figures 4E and 4F), yet did not change the resting membrane
potential or spike rate in cartwheel cells (p > 0.05; n = 9; Figures
4B–4D), the primary feed-forward inhibitory neuron of the multi-
sensory pathway.
To explore the basis of the postsynaptic effect of 5-HT on
vertical cells, we recorded in voltage-clamp configuration at
�70 mV, observing a 5-HT-induced slow inward current (Fig-
ure S3A). No effect of 5-HT was seen in recordings from
cartwheel cells (data not shown). The inward current in vertical
cells could be largely abolished by the selective 5-HT2ARs
antagonist MDL-11939 (2 mM), and was mimicked by application
of 30 mM a-methyl-5-HT, a selective agonist of 5-HT2ARs (Fig-
ures S3A and S3B), consistent with the presence of 5-HT2ARs
in the DCN (Cornea-He

Wright et al., 1995), and labeling of presumptive DCN vertical

Furthermore,
5-
HT-induced current was abolished by
intracellular GTP-g-S (1.5 mM), a non-
hydrolysable GTP analog that blocks G
protein in its activated state (Figures S3A
and S3B), confirming that the 5-HT-

signaling. Finally, we found that this cur-
rent could be largely blocked by HCN
channel blockers, Cs+ (2 mM) or ZD7288
(20 mM) (Figures S3A and S3B), indicating
that HCN channels are the primary down-
stream targets for these observed excit-
atory actions of 5-HT. These data are almost identical to results
for fusiform cells (Tang and Trussell, 2015) and suggest that fusi-
form and vertical cells may use the same pathways in their
response to 5-HT.
5-HT Does Not Affect Transmitter Release from
Vertical Cells
We next tested for effects of 5-HT on other key synapses in the
circuit. 5-HT did not change the peak amplitude or the PPR of
ANF-to-vertical cell EPSCs (Figures 5A–5C) or PF-to-cartwheel
cell EPSCs (Figures 5B and 5C). Although 5-HT did not increase
EPSCs in vertical cells, it markedly increased the firing probabil-
ity of spikes evoked by a train of suprathreshold ‘‘strong’’ stimu-
lation of ANF input (firing probability in control: 0.44 ± 0.04; firing
probability in 5-HT: 0.81 ± 0.08; p < 0.001; n = 12; Figures 5D
and 5G), indicating that 5-HT increased coupling between
EPSPs and action potential generation. Interestingly, 5-HT had
no significant effect on the latency to spiking in vertical cells
evoked by a train of strong intensity stimulation of ANF (control
2.77 ± 0.33 ms versus 5-HT 2.51 ± 0.29 ms; n = 10; p > 0.05,
paired t test) despite the larger spike probability. 5-HT also
enhanced the firing probability in response to subthreshold
EPSPs evoked by ‘‘weak’’ ANF stimulation (firing probability in
1848
Cell Reports 20, 1844–1854, August 22, 2017
 control: 0.00 ± 0.00; firing probability in 5-HT: 0.17 ± 0.03; p <
0.01; n = 5 out of 6 cells; Figures 5E–5G). These data illustrate
that the way in which 5-HT increases inhibition is specifically
by recruitment, allowing vertical cells to fire more consistently
during ANF activity, and by extension to allow more vertical cells
contacting a given fusiform cell to become active.
To test the possibility that 5-HT could directly affect inhibitory
transmission between vertical and fusiform cells, we made dual
recordings from synaptically connected vertical cell-fusiform cell
pairs (Figure S4). Unitary IPSCs in fusiform cells were triggered
by trains of spikes at 50 Hz evoked via somatic current injection
into presynaptic vertical cells. Although 5-HT depolarized the
vertical cells, it did not change the amplitude (p > 0.05; n = 5
pairs; Figures S4B and S4D) or short-term plasticity (p > 0.05)
of unitary IPSCs in fusiform cells. Similarly, 5-HT also did not
affect the unitary IPSCs in fusiform cells evoked by spikes in
connected cartwheel cells (p > 0.05; n = 6 pairs; Figures S4C
and S4E). These data suggest that 5-HT regulates feed-forward
inhibition to fusiform cells through enhanced excitability of verti-
cal cells, rather than through a direct effect on ANF-vertical cell
excitatory synapses or vertical cell-fusiform cell inhibitory
synapses.

Error bars represent SEM. **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001.
To further confirm that it is excitation of
vertical cells by 5-HT that accounts for the
enhanced feed-forward inhibition in fusi-
form cells, we made paired recordings
from synaptically coupled vertical and
fusiform cells, and monitored spike and
IPSC activity, respectively, as 5-HT was
washed into the bath (Figures 6A and
6B). 5-HT triggered copious firing in the
vertical cell and increased the frequency
of spontaneous IPSCs in the postsynaptic fusiform cell (Figures
6C–6G). 5-HT increased both the frequency and the amplitude of
IPSCs (Figures 6C–6E). Because 5-HT has no direct effect on the
inhibitory synapses, the increase in amplitude presumably arose
from an increase in spike-evoked, non-uniquantal spontaneous
events. In order to determine whether the enhanced IPSCs
were due to the vertical cell, we made presynaptic spike-trig-
gered averages, revealing that IPSCs often occurred immedi-
ately after a spontaneous (5-HT-induced) presynaptic spike.
The latency from the spike to the onset of the IPSC was consis-
tent with monosynaptic transmission from the recorded vertical
cell (Figures 6F and 6G; mean latency: 0.48 ± 0.06 ms; n = 5).
5-HT Reduces Post-excitation Pauses Identically for
ANF- and PF-Driven Spike Activity
A well-known feature of fusiform cells recorded in vivo or in vitro
is a prolonged HCN-dependent afterhyperpolarization that fol-
lows afferent activity, sufficient to eliminate the spontaneous
spike activity that is typical of these neurons (Apostolides and
Trussell, 2014; Hancock and Voigt, 2002; Rhode et al., 1983).
We found that this pause in spiking was also modulated by
5-HT; however, unlike its differential effects on afferent activity,
Cell Reports 20, 1844–1854, August 22, 2017
1849
 the pause was modulated identically for both sensory pathways,
consistent with a postsynaptic site of action of 5-HT. The dura-
tion of this pause was defined as the latency from last synaptic
stimulation to the first spontaneous spike. 5-HT reduced the
pause in response to either ANF or PF stimuli (latency in control:
572 ± 49 ms; latency in 5-HT: 300 ± 44 ms; p < 0.001; n = 11;
Figures 7A, 7B, 7D, and 7E). We reasoned that this pause could
result from the deactivation of HCN channels during spike trains,
leading to a rebound hyperpolarization after spiking ceases. As
5-HT depolarizes the neurons, this deactivation is already
partially in place prior to evoked spiking; given that the sponta-
neous firing rate is enhanced by the depolarization, both effects
should reduce the pause duration. We tested this idea by
mimicking 5-HT’s depolarizing effect by somatic current injec-
tion. As expected, somatic current injections (+50 to +100 pA)
fully mimicked the effect of 5-HT (Figures 7C and 7E). Altogether,
our data suggest an input pathway/circuit selectivity neuromo-
dulation that biases the sensitivity of the principal cell toward

 multisensory signals, while simultaneously reducing the quies-
cent state following signals from any source.
DISCUSSION
We identified a neuromodulatory circuit mechanism that sup-
pressed signaling through the auditory pathway in DCN, while
simultaneously enhancing transmission through a multisensory
pathway. Given that the primary target of the DCN is the inferior
colliculus, and given the striking convergence of multiple modal-
ities into the DCN, such pathway-selective neuromodulation
could enhance the salience of particular sensory events associ-
ated in time with a given acoustic signal, such as somatosensory
activity from pinna, head/neck movement, or trigeminal activity
(Kanold and Young, 2001; Kanold et al., 2011; Shore, 2005).
Serotonergic Regulation of Inhibitory Microcircuit Is
Cell-Type Specific
Inhibitory interneurons are critical in adjusting relative sensitivity
to the diverse inputs a neural circuit receives (Huang et al.,
2007; McBain and Fisahn, 2001; Roberts et al., 2013). Accord-
ingly, differential control of interneurons by neuromodulators is
a potent mechanism for circuit-level plasticity (Lawrence,
2008). Although vertical cells and cartwheel cells are the most
common interneuron in the DCN, their response to 5-HT is
sharply different. Indeed, the entire shift in response toward
the multimodal input can be accounted for by the actions of
the 5-HT2AR/HCN channel signaling pathway in the principal
cells and a single type of interneuron, the vertical cell, with an
additional small contribution from 5-HT1AR in presynaptic
inhibition.

Cells

inhibition. Bottom: the raster plots for the activity of spike in these two fusiform cells during (A) ANF or (B) PF stimulation presentation in the absence and presence

injection (control: black traces; current injection: green traces). Current injection reduced this pause. Bottom: an example of raster plots for the activity of spike in
the fusiform cell (A) during ANF stimulation presentation under the control and current injection conditions (current injection indicated by two dashed green lines

 Clearly, there are multiple possible ways in which this circuit
could be controlled to effect a shift from auditory to multimodal
signaling, for example, by purely presynaptic modulation at the
input level. Although 5-HT increased excitability and sponta-
neous firing of vertical cells, it did not affect strength of EPSCs
or unitary IPSCs in the ANF/vertical cell/fusiform cell inhibi-
tory sequence. 5-HT also increased the likelihood of coupling
between ANF EPSPs and action potential initiation in vertical
cell, again by a postsynaptic mechanism. Finally, dual record-
ings provided direct evidence that 5-HT increased vertical cell-
mediated inhibitory activity in fusiform cells. Given that multiple
vertical cells converge upon each fusiform cell (Kuo et al.,
2012; Voigt and Young, 1990), and the vertical cell excitability
is enhanced by 5-HT, the enhanced inhibition of the fusiform
cell’s ANF responses reflects the enhanced recruitment of inhib-
itory neurons. Intriguingly, this simple mechanism assures that
the level of inhibition would scale with the degree of auditory
activity. In contrast to 5-HT’s modulation of ANF/fusiform cell
feed-forward inhibitory microcircuit, the noradrenergic system
selectively regulates the excitability of cartwheel cells and en-
hances the signal-to-noise ratio of inhibitory signals through
the multisensory pathway (Kuo and Trussell, 2011), whereas
dopamine acts to adjust spike modes determined by cartwheel
cell axons (Bender et al., 2010). Therefore, different neuromodu-
latory systems can control DCN circuits in distinct ways, yet all
appear to have selectivity in their target inhibitory neurons, and
thereby may guide distinctly different alterations in processing.
Functional Implications of Serotonergic Modulation
What are the functional outcomes of enhanced multisensory
processing in DCN? A similar multisensory enhancement has
been reported in superior colliculus and neocortex (Alvarado
et al., 2009; Olcese et al., 2013), and proposed as a key mecha-
nism to enhance the salience of context events. Therefore, mod-
ulation of integration of sensory signals at the DCN circuit
provides flexibility in bi-modal integration (Chabrol et al., 2015;
Shore, 2005), allowing multisensory cues potentially to improve
detection and discrimination of events in the context environ-
ment. In support of this notion, behavioral studies suggest that
integration of multisensory input improves the accuracy of orien-
tation of sounds (Kanold and Young, 2001; Young et al., 1995).
Therefore, this serotonergic neural circuit could be a key compo-
nent of the DCN circuitry highlighting the response to salient
environmental events.
Studies of 5-HT actions in DCN in vivo show conflicting results
(Ebert and Ostwald, 1992; Felix et al., 2017), possibly as a result
of variations in where 5-HT is iontophoretically released relative
to the location of recorded neurons. In this study, 5-HT was
applied uniformly throughout the tissue. If it acts locally, rather
than diffusely, the inhibition ANF signals could have a more
significant outcome. In vivo studies suggested that vertical-
cell-mediated inhibition may regulate frequency and/or intensity
tuning (Nelken and Young, 1994; Spirou et al., 1999; Young and
Davis, 2002; Zhou et al., 2012). If 5-HT was released locally so as
to act on subsets of vertical cells, auditory receptive fields might
be sharpened relative to the basal discharge of the cell or may be
shifted in their borders. Thus, 5-HT-induced suppression of
auditory stimuli might refine sensory receptive fields and mini-
mize potentially distracting effects of competing stimuli, thus
providing an efficient strategy to improve sound localization in
noisy environments. Future study should explore how 5-HT
release regulates the DCN circuitry and consequently modulates
its function in living animals.
Beyond the physiological function of 5-HT, our findings may
provide insight into the biological mechanisms of tinnitus. Aber-
rant serotonergic neurotransmission is implicated in tinnitus
(Caperton and Thompson, 2011; Norena et al., 1999; Salvinelli
et al., 2003; Simpson and Davies, 2000), and enhanced activity
(hyperactivity) in fusiform cells of the DCN is also associated
with tinnitus (Brozoski et al., 2002; Dehmel et al., 2012; Li
et al., 2013). Thus, it will be important to determine whether
dysfunctional modulation of the DCN could play a role in central
tinnitus. The tonic excitation of fusiform cells is one tinnitus-like
outcome. However, studies indicate that the tinnitus can be
enhanced in many patients by movement of the head or jaw
(Levine and Oron, 2015); such an effect may be related to
increased effectiveness of somatosensory signaling in the DCN
by 5-HT. Thus, the current study may provide a basis for future
work to understand whether dysregulation of 5-HT signaling
could affect the experience of tinnitus.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Animals
All procedures were approved by the IACUC of Oregon Health and Science
University. Animals used in this study were C57BL/6J wild-type mice or trans-
genic mice. GlyT2-EGFP mice (labeling glycinergic neurons) were back-
crossed into C57BL/6J wild-type mice and maintained and genotyped as
previously described (Roberts et al., 2008). NF107-Cre-tdTomato mice (a
gift of Chip Gerfen) were generated by crossing NF107-Cre mice with an Ai9
reporter line.
Electrophysiology
Refer to Supplemental Experimental Procedures for detailed methods. For
most experiments, fusiform cell, cartwheel cell, and vertical cell were identified
based on their location, morphology, and electrophysiological properties.
Additionally, GlyT2-EGFP (all glycinergic neurons labeled) transgenic mice in
which EGFP is expressed in glycinergic neurons were used to identify vertical
and cartwheel cells. Whole-cell recordings were performed in acute conven-
tional or thick brain slices containing the DCN using patch pipettes filled
with a K+-based intracellular solution.
Paired Recordings
For paired pre- and postsynaptic recordings (vertical cell-fusiform cell or cart-
wheel cell-fusiform cell), fusiform cells were voltage-clamped with an intracel-
lular solution containing 20 mM Alexa Fluor 488 so that morphology could be
confirmed. Then, nearby (<50 mm intersomatic distance) vertical cells in the
deep layer or cartwheel cells in the molecular layer of the fusiform cell were
patched in current-clamp mode. After identifying synaptically coupled vertical
cell-fusiform cell or cartwheel cell-fusiform cell pairs and demonstrating reli-
able induction of unitary IPSCs in the postsynaptic fusiform cell upon depolar-
ization of the presynaptic vertical cell or cartwheel cell, the effects of 5-HT on
unitary IPSCs were then tested.
Statistical Analysis
All traces were acquired with pClamp 10 software (Molecular Devices) and
Axograph X. All figures were made with IgorPro (WaveMetrics). All data are
presented as mean ± SEM unless specified otherwise, and statistical signifi-
cance was assessed using Student’s t tests as appropriate: *p < 0.05; **p <
0.01; ***p < 0.001. Further details are in the Supplemental Experimental
Procedures.
