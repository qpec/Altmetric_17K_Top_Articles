IMPORTANCE Mechanical ventilation may be lifesaving, but in certain persons, such as those
with advanced dementia, it may prolong patient suffering without a clear survival benefit.
OBJECTIVE To describe the use and outcomes of mechanical ventilation and its association
with the increasing numbers of intensive care unit (ICU) beds in the United States for patients
with advanced dementia residing in a nursing home 120 days before that hospital admission.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This retrospective cohort study evaluated Medicare
beneficiaries with advanced dementia hospitalized from January 1, 2000, to December 31,
2013, using the Minimum Data Set assessments linked with Medicare part A claims. A hospital
fixed-effect, multivariable logistic regression model examined the effect of changes in ICU
beds within individual hospitals and the likelihood of receiving mechanical ventilation,
controlling for patients’demographic characteristics, function, and comorbidities.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Mechanical ventilation.
RESULTS From 2000 to 2013, a total of 635 008 hospitalizations of 380 060 eligible
patients occurred (30.5% male and 69.5% female; mean [SD] age, 84.4 [7.4] years). Use of
mechanical ventilation increased from 39 per 1000 hospitalizations in 2000 to 78 per 1000
hospitalizations in 2013 (P < .001, test of linear trend). As the number of ICU beds in a
hospital increased over time, patients with advanced dementia were more likely to receive
mechanical ventilation (ie, adjusted odds ratio per 10 ICU bed increase, 1.06; 95% CI,
1.05-1.07). In 2013, hospitals in the top decile in the number of ICU beds were reimbursed
$9611.89 per hospitalization compared with $8050.24 per hospitalization in the lower decile
(P < .001) without an improvement in 1-year mortality (65.2% vs 64.6%; P = 54).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among hospitalized nursing home residents with advanced
dementia, we found an increase in the use of mechanical ventilation over time without
substantial improvement in survival. This increase in the use of mechanical ventilation was
associated with an increase in the number of ICU beds within a hospital.

A
t present, more than 5 million persons have demen-
tia; by 2050, dementia will result in 1.6 million deaths.1
Intensive care units (ICUs) may be an appropriate lo-
cation of care for some elderly patients, but the role of the ICU
in the medical care of persons with advanced dementia raises
concerns about whether this care is consistent with informed
preferences, has the potential to improve the quality of life,
and provides increased value from a societal perspective.2-4
The disease trajectory of advanced dementia is characterized
by progressive cognitive and functional impairment, with 86%
developing eating problems that often lead to malnutrition; re-
current infections are common and are often accompanied by
burdensome patterns of hospitalizations before death.5
Striking variation in ICU use across hospitals persists
even after adjustment for health status, expected mortality,
race/ethnicity, and preferences of patients and their
families.6,7 Despite the expense and potential burdens of ICU
care, ICU admission remains one of the few Medicare sites of
care without regulatory oversight.8 Although the number of
hospital beds has decreased during the past decade, the
number of ICU beds has grown, with few hospitals account-
ing for much of this growth.9 As noted by Gooch and Kahn,10
the increase in the number of ICU beds raises a concern that
increased ICU bed capacity may result in the use of ICUs by
patients unlikely to benefit, such as persons with advanced
dementia.
Our goal is to characterize temporal trends in the use of
mechanical ventilation, the survival of patients with ad-
vanced dementia, and the association of the increased use of
mechanical ventilation in hospitals that increased their num-
ber of ICU beds. In addition, we describe the difference in the
use of health care services and costs among these patients ad-
mitted to hospitals within the lowest and highest decile re-
garding the number of ICU beds in 2013.
Methods
We obtained our study sample from a national repository of
the Minimum Data Set (MDS) assessments linked with
Medicare part A claims from January 1, 2000, to December
31, 2013. The MDS is a federally mandated nursing assess-
ment conducted on admission and at least quarterly that
contains detailed demographic and clinical information on
every resident living in all Medicare- or Medicaid-certified
US nursing facilities. A retrospective cohort of hospitalized
fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries from 2000 to 2013
was examined to see whether they were in a nursing home
during the 120 days immediately before that hospital admis-
sion. Based on that MDS assessment, we identified hospital-
izations during which the nursing home resident had a pre-
existing diagnosis of dementia (the equivalent of an MDS
Cognitive Performance Scale score of 5 or 6, indicating the
most severe cognitive impairment),11 and documentation of
impairments in 4 or more activities of daily living. This
study was reviewed and approved by the institutional
review board of Brown University, who waived the require-
ment for patient consent.
Definitions
Based on the procedure codes (96.70, 96.71, and 96.72 from
theInternationalClassificationofDiseases,NinthRevision,Clini-
cal Modification) documented in the Medicare claims data, we
identified hospitalizations during which a nursing home resi-
dent with advanced dementia received mechanical ventila-
tion. A Danish registry found that coding for mechanical ven-
tilation had a positive predictive value of 100%.12 The numbers
of ICU and ICU step-down beds were based on the American
Hospital Association (AHA) annual survey, a voluntary mea-
sure that most US hospitals complete. We used available sur-
veysthatwereconductedin2000,2005,2007,2010,and2013.
Unlike using hospital cost reports to determine the number of
ICU beds, only the AHA data are able to examine the use of ICU
step-down beds.13
Individual Characteristics
Information on the sample’
s sociodemographic characteris-
tics was based on the Medicare Beneficiary Enrollment file that
includes age, race/ethnicity, sex, and state of residence. Race/
ethnicity is based on information collected by the Social Secu-
rity Administration and was used in the analysis as a potential
confounder.Medicaldiagnoses,function,cognitivestatus,and
otherpatientcharacteristicswerebasedontheassessmentcom-
pleted as part of the MDS within 120 days of that hospitaliza-
tion.BecauseofachangeinvariablescollectedintheMDS,ver-
sion 3.0, after 2010, information on do-not-resuscitate (DNR)
orders and other restrictions on life-sustaining treatment were
included only in sensitivity analyses using data from 2000 to
2010. A DNR order, as defined by the MDS, version 2.0, instruc-
tion manual,14 includes no intubation in the event of respira-
tory or circulatory failure.
Statistical Analysis
Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the changing
use of mechanical ventilation from 2000 to 2001, 2004 to
2005, 2006 to 2007, 2009 to 2010, and 2012 to 2013 that cor-
responded to the years of available AHA annual survey data
(2000, 2005, 2007, 2010, and 2013) on the number of ICU and
ICU step-down beds in each hospital. Temporal trends were
tested using a variance-weighted least squares model for bi-
variate associations and a multivariable model that adjusted
Key Points
Question Among hospitalized patients with advanced dementia,
how is the use of mechanical ventilation associated with the
increasing number of intensive care unit (ICU) beds?
Findings In this cohort study, mechanical ventilation increased
2-fold without improved survival. Nursing home residents
admitted to a hospital that increased their ICU beds by 10 had an
increased risk for mechanical ventilation.
Meaning Increasing rates of mechanical ventilation raise the need
for multifaceted interventions to improve advance care planning in
nursing homes, decision making in the hospital, and a national
strategic plan regarding regional ICU bed growth.

for patients’sociodemographic characteristics, cognitive sta-
tus, and functional status with an indicator variable for year.
To examine the association of change in the number of ICU and
ICU step-down beds within each hospital, a multivariable hos-
pital fixed-effect logistic model was used that adjusted for a
similar set of patient-level covariates. The use of the fixed-
effect model allows us to examine the change in ICU beds and
ICU step-down beds within each hospital over time with the
riskforpersonswithadvanceddementiaundergoingmechani-
cal ventilation. The number of ICU step-down beds was en-
tered into the model as a separate independent variable based
on the hypothesis that improving staffing in an ICU step-
down unit compared with a regular hospital floor may pre-
vent the use of mechanical ventilation. We tested for a non-
linearassociationbetweenICUbedsandtheriskformechanical
ventilation with a cubic spline. Based on the MDS assessment
completed 120 days before that hospitalization, we included
in the model the following patient characteristics: (1) sociode-
mographiccharacteristics(age,sex,andrace/ethnicity);(2)cog-
nitive and functional status; (3) clinical diagnosis recorded on
the MDS assessment; (4) whether the patient had a prior hos-
pitalization in the preceding 120 days; and (5) the days from
the MDS assessment to hospitalization.
In the first sensitivity analysis, we examined whether the
association of ICU beds with the risk for mechanical ventila-
tionheldwhenadjustingforthepresenceofaDNRorder,avari-
able that is available in the MDS from 2000 to 2010 but not in
version 3.0 instituted in 2011. A second sensitivity test exam-
inedwhethertheassociationwithgrowthinthenumberofICU
beds held when only admissions for pneumonia and/or sep-
ticemia were considered. These stratified analyses allowed us
to exclude cases that were admitted for trauma or surgical con-
ditions. A third sensitivity analysis examined whether the as-
sociation held when we restricted the analyses to persons with
the equivalent of an MDS Cognitive Performance Scale score
of 6—the highest level of cognitive impairment—and persons
impaired in all 7 activities of daily living using the data from
2000 to 2013. Finally, we completed 2 additional analyses to
address concerns that, over time, hospitalizations of persons
with advanced dementia have been reduced. We estimated the
denominator of persons in a nursing home with advanced de-
mentia who met our study criteria. Inverse probability weights
were used to balance rates of risk factors across all years, en-
suring that changes in outcomes over time are not owing to
changes in patient risk profiles over time.
To better describe the clinical and financial implications
of the variation in the number of ICU beds in 2013, we char-
acterize the hospital length of stay and reimbursement for that
hospitalization after adjustment for regional variation and
graduate medical education payment. Statistical testing was
2-sided with a threshold of P < .05. All analyses were per-
formed with STATA software, version 14 (StataCorp).
Results
A total of 635 008 hospitalizations of 380 060 patients (30.5%
male and 69.5% female; mean [SD] age, 84.4 [7.4] years)
occurred in the selected years of available AHA data. Table 1
reports the distribution of age, sex, race/ethnicity, and cogni-
tive and functional status of these patients who were hospi-
talizedwithin120daysofthatassessment.In2013,98.2%(95%
CI, 98.1%-98.3%) of these patients with advanced dementia
were bed bound, 23.2% (95% CI, 22.8%-23.6%) had a feeding
tube, and 63.4% (95% CI, 62.9%-63.9%) of persons without a
feedingtubewereprescribedamechanicalsoftdiet.Overtime,
the proportion of patients who were black or Hispanic in-
creased. The mean (SD) hospital length of stay declined from
7.1 days (7.0; interquartile range, 3-9 days) in 2000 to 6.3 days
(6.0; interquartile range, 3-8 days) in 2013. Admissions to the
ICU increased from 16.9% (95% CI, 16.7%-17.1%) in 2000 to
38.5% (95% CI, 38.1%-38.8%) in 2013, whereas the mean (SD)
length of ICU stay increased from 5.0 days (6.2; interquartile
range, 2-6 days) in 2000 to 5.4 days (5.7; interquartile range,
2-7 days) in 2013.
The Figure presents the change in the proportion of hos-
pitalizationsofstudypatientswhounderwentmechanicalven-
tilation. In 2000, mechanical ventilation was used in 39 per
1000hospitaladmissionswithasteadyincreaseto78per1000
admissions in 2013 (P < .001, test of trend). Table 2 reports the
mean monthly incidence rates of hospitalization and mechani-
cal ventilation from 2000 to 2012 using the denominator of
all nursing home residents with advanced dementia and 4 or
more activities of daily living impairments. The incidence rate
of mechanical ventilation increased from 0.19% in 2000 to
0.32% in 2012. When we restricted the sample to only those
persons hospitalized with pneumonia or septicemia, the rate
of increase in the use of mechanical ventilation grew from 44.8
per 1000 admissions in 2000 to 126.8 per 1000 admissions in
2013 (Figure) (P < .001, test of trend). The overall 1-year mor-
tality for patients receiving mechanical ventilation remained
consistently greater than 80% in all cohorts. In 2012, 51.1% of
patients receiving mechanical ventilation died in the hospital
or within 30 days of admission. In 2013, the cost of care for
these patients was $95.3 million.
Table 3 presents the multivariable hospital fixed-effect
model. A fixed-effect model examines the association of
changes in ICU beds with the risk for mechanical ventilation
within each hospital over time. For each increase of 10 ICU
beds per hospital, the adjusted odds ratio (AOR) is 1.06 (95%
CI, 1.05-1.07), indicating a 6% increase in the receipt of
mechanical ventilation among hospitalized nursing home
residents with advanced dementia admitted to that hospi-
tal. An increase in ICU step-down beds did not have a pro-
tective effect, but mechanical ventilation had a slight
increase (AOR, 1.01; 95% CI, 1.004-1.01). We tested for a
nonlinear association of ICU bed growth with the risk for
mechanical ventilation with cubic spline and found that
P = .98, thus rejecting the hypothesis of nonlinearity.
We conducted 4 additional sensitivity analyses. When we
restricted our analysis to hospitalizations for patients with a
primary reason for admission of pneumonia or septicemia, we
foundtheincreaseinICUbedshadanAORof1.11(95%CI,1.09-
1.13). The second analysis restricting the sample to only those
cases with MDS Cognitive Performance Scale scores of 6 and
7 activities of daily living impairments found an AOR of 1.06

was not due to a difference in preferences for resuscitation.
A final sensitivity analysis addressed the concern of changing
characteristics of hospitalized patients (Table 3). Using in-

to document the care of 4171 persons admitted to hospitals in
the highest decile of ICU beds compared with the 4333 per-

Table 4 contrasts that proportion of persons receiving me-

stay. The health care reimbursement for admission to a hos-
pital in the highest decile of ICU beds was $9611.89 per per-
son compared with $8050.24 for persons hospitalized in the
lowest decile without a change in 1-year mortality (65.2% vs

We document a 2-fold increase in the use of mechanical venti-

vival. In 2013, Medicare expended nearly $100 million in this
high-intensity, low-value care. More important, the total num-
berofhospitalbedsintheUnitedStateshasdecreased,whereas
the number of ICU beds has increased. During times of a public
healthcrisis,suchasanearthquakeorinfluenzaepidemic,anex-
cess capacity of ICU beds may be lifesaving, but multiple

as those with advanced dementia. We found that persons with

mechanical ventilation. Such care seems inconsistent with the

Although our analysis used a hospital fixed-effect multi-
variable model that compared changes in ICU beds and in me-
chanical ventilation within individual hospitals over time, we
cannot conclude that simply reducing the number of ICU beds
will reduce the use of mechanical ventilation for persons with
advanced dementia. Rather, the increase of ICU beds may be
a marker for norms that guide and determine decision mak-
ing by clinicians, and perhaps patients and families, regard-
ing the use of the ICU toward the end of life.6,17-19 For ex-
ample, Barnato and colleagues17 conducted an ethnographic
studycomparingahospitalwithhigh-intensityend-of-lifecare
with a hospital with low-intensity end-of-life care: in the for-
mer, the cultural norm was to only discuss changing the goals
of care late in the disease course, whereas in the hospital with
low-intensitycare,theculturalnormwastotalkaboutthegoals
of care early in the hospital stay. Qualitative studies of hospi-
tals in the United States and United Kingdom similarly found
variability in communication about DNR orders, which high-
light the importance of institutional norms.20 Therefore, mul-
tifaceted interventions probably will be needed to ensure that
care is consistent with the informed preferences of the pa-
tient and his or her family.
Single-focused interventions will likely fail to address this
complexsocialinteraction.21Multifacetedandsequentialinter-
ventions are likely needed to address multiple targets, includ-

OneoftheadvantagesoftheAHAdatacomparedwithhos-

tiveness and value of step-down beds is limited. We hypoth-

acutecarebedsbutlessabilitytointervenetechnologicallythan
an ICU might prevent mechanical ventilation for these pa-
tients. However, we found that an increase in the number of
step-down beds did not result in a lower proportion of per-
sons receiving mechanical ventilation. Further research is
needed to understand the influence of the growing number of
ICU step-down beds.
Several important limitations should be acknowledged in
interpreting the findings of this study. First, our analyses are
based on Medicare claims data and the MDS. Information on
patient preferences is lacking with the exception of DNR or-
ders from 2000 to 2010. Even after adjusting for the pres-
ence of DNR orders, the association of increasing ICU beds and
use of mechanical ventilation persisted. Furthermore, prior re-
search suggests that patient preferences do not explain this
variability.22 Second, we relied on data from the AHA annual
surveyforinformationonthenumberofICUbedsandICUstep-
down beds. Not all hospitals participate in the AHA annual sur-
vey. Hospitals excluded from this analysis were smaller, less
likely to be affiliated with medical schools, and more likely to
be critical access hospitals (eMethods and eTables 1 through
5 in the Supplement). Furthermore, hospitals completing the
AHA annual survey may inaccurately report their number of
ICU step-down beds. Third, the rate of hospital admissions for
patients with advanced dementia decreased. This fact raises
the question of whether sicker persons are being admitted to
the hospital. Because of this concern, we conducted 3 sensi-
tivity analyses. Each found the same association between the
increase in the number of ICU beds and the use of mechanical
ventilation for persons with advanced dementia. Finally, de-
spite our sensitivity analyses examining preexisting DNR or-
ders,patientswithdifferentpreferencepatternsmayhavebeen
admitted over time and not been captured by our data.
Conclusions
From 2000 to 2013, the use of mechanical ventilation for hos-
pitalized persons with advanced dementia and severe func-
tional impairment increased without substantial evidence of
improved survival. These hospitalized patients were at higher
risk for mechanical ventilation when they were admitted to
hospitals that had increased their number of ICU beds. Our re-
sults call for reconsideration of the role that the excess sup-
ply of ICU beds23 plays in the ICU admission and subsequent
mechanical ventilation of patients with advanced dementia.
Furthermore, our results highlight the urgency of developing
a multifaceted approach to address the increasing intensity of
care for the growing population of patients with advanced de-
mentia. Such an approach will need to align clinical care and
financial incentives with patients’informed preferences and
provide the needed education and training for health care
professionals24toensurethatdecisionstousemechanicalven-
tilation in persons with advanced dementia are based on high-
quality shared decision making that incorporates the goals of
care of informed patients and their families.

Intensive Care Unit Bed Availability and Use
of Mechanical Ventilation in Nursing Home Residents
With Advanced Dementia
When We Build It, Why Do They Come?
Gary S. Winzelberg, MD, MPH; Laura C. Hanson, MD, MPH
Caring for the expanding population of patients with ad-
vanced dementia is one of the most important challenges for
the US health care system. Patients and families experience an
extraordinary illness trajectory including years of functional
dependency and high rates of acute and long-term health care
use. The final stage of dementia lasts more than a year and is
marked by acute comorbidities including frequent infections.1
Teno and colleagues2 examine a specific trend in treat-
ment within a national cohort of long-stay nursing home resi-
dents with advanced dementia: the use of mechanical venti-
lation in the intensive care unit (ICU). The study’
s main finding
was a 2-fold increase in me-
chanical ventilation use from
2000 to 2013 from 39 to 78
per 1000 hospitalizations.
Furthermore, there was an association between increased ICU
bed availability and mechanical ventilation use for patients
with advanced dementia, even after adjusting for multiple pa-
tient-level characteristics.
This study’
s findings both confirm and contrast with find-
ingsofpriorhealthservicesresearchdescribingtrendsininten-
sive treatment use. While in-hospital deaths decreased during
this decade, in a prior analysis Teno et al3 found increased ICU
useamongMedicarebeneficiariesinthelastmonthoflife.How-

liativecareservices,particularlyinacutecarehospitalsettings.
Taken together, findings of current research signal curiously

long life for older, seriously ill patients.
What factors promote increased use of mechanical venti-
lation for older patients with advanced dementia whose fami-
lieshavealreadyoptedforhospitalization?Astheauthorsnote,
the mere presence of an ICU bed does not cause patients with
advanced dementia to receive mechanical ventilation. While
system and hospital factors must be addressed to deliver ICU
care and mechanical ventilation use consistent with patient
preferences,effectivechangescannotbeachievedwithoutalso
addressing patient and family factors.
In this study, infections—pneumonia and septicemia—
resulted in most of the increased use of mechanical ventila-
tion for patients with advanced dementia.2 Importantly, in-
fections may be regarded by clinicians as reversible and
treatable rather than as symptomatic of the final stage of in-
curable dementia.
In the present study, Teno and colleagues2 also found
that in 2013, one-third of their study patients with advanced
dementia had a feeding tube, compared with only 5.6%
found in a national sample from the same year.4 This higher
prevalence of feeding tube use may indicate that some of the
family surrogate decision makers for patients in the present
study sought broad use of invasive interventions indepen-
dent of any clear mortality benefit, or perhaps they lacked
information regarding hospice and palliative care options in
the long-term care setting prior to hospitalization. Mechani-
cal ventilation use was also more frequent among black and
Hispanic patients, 2 ethnic groups that had increased as a
portion of the population during the study period. Finally,
unmeasured characteristics could have influenced decision
making, including families’religious and spiritual beliefs,
surrogates’degree of decisional conflict, and variation in
availability of palliative care services.
