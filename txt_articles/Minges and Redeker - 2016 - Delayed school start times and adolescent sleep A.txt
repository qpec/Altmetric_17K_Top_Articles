Review of the Experimental Evidence

Summary
Many schools have instituted later morning start times to improve sleep, academic, and other 
outcomes in response to the mismatch between youth circadian rhythms and early morning start 
times. However, there has been no systematic synthesis of the evidence on the effects of this 
practice. To examine the impact of delayed school start time on students’ sleep, health, and 
academic outcomes, electronic databases were systematically searched and data were extracted 
using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 
guidelines. Six studies satisfied selection criteria and used pre-post, no control (n=3), randomized 
controlled trial (n=2), and quasi-experimental (n=1) designs. School start times were delayed 25 to 
60 minutes, and correspondingly, total sleep time increased from 25 to 77 minutes per weeknight. 
Some studies revealed reduced daytime sleepiness, depression, caffeine use, tardiness to class, and 
trouble staying awake. Overall, the evidence supports recent non-experimental study findings and 
calls for policy that advocates for delayed school start time to improve sleep. This presents a 
potential long-term solution to chronic sleep restriction during adolescence. However, there is a 
need for rigorous randomized study designs and reporting of consistent outcomes, including 
objective sleep measures and consistent measures of health and academic performance.

 Introduction
Research conducted over the past four decades has demonstrated that acquiring adequate 
sleep and maintaining a sleep schedule that is consistent with physiological circadian 
rhythmicity is a component of normal growth and development during childhood and 
adolescence.[1] Adequate sleep is needed to achieve optimal mental and physical alertness, 
daytime functioning, and learning capacity in youth,[2, 3] qualities that are of particular 
importance in the school setting.
Although guidelines differ in terms of recommendations for total sleep time,[4] the National 
Sleep Foundation released recommendations in February 2015 that school-aged children (6 
to 13 years) and adolescents (14 to 17 years) obtain at least 9 to 11 hours and 8 to 10 hours 
of sleep per night, respectively.[5] Yet, by some estimates, only one in ten adolescents meet 
these recommendations on weeknights.[6, 7] The high prevalence of sleep restriction may be 
due to early school start times that conflict with the normal developmental shift in circadian 
biology that favors phase delay (late morning-late day activities and later bedtimes) during 
puberty development, as indicated by daily endocrine rhythms.[8, 9] In addition to the 
physiological underpinnings, evening chronotype preference may be driven by social 
pressures rooted in involuntary (e.g. staying awake to complete homework) or voluntary 
(e.g. engaging with social media) actions.[10]
The large proportion of adolescents who do not obtain optimal sleep duration [6, 7] is 
particularly alarming because chronic sleep restriction, defined as partial sleep deprivation, 
sleep loss, insufficient or deficient sleep, leads to a myriad of health, safety, behavioral, and 
cognitive and academic deficits. Disrupted sleep-wake cycles and sleep restriction also 
contribute to pathophysiological effects on the renal, cardiovascular, thermoregulatory, 
digestive, and endocrine systems.[2, 11] Sleep restriction can lead to insulin resistance and 
changes in the satiety hormones leptin and ghrelin,[12, 13] all mechanisms for the 
development of metabolic abnormalities, obesity, and type 2 diabetes.[14–17] Inadequate 
sleep is also associated with many risky health behaviors, such as lack of physical activity, 
suicidal ideation, and substance use,[6, 18–20] as well as motor vehicle accidents related to 
drowsy driving[21, 22] and sport-related injuries.[23]
Sleep restriction also contributes to several cognitive and behavioral problems that adversely 
impact academic performance and functioning. For instance, adolescents who are 
chronically sleep restricted perform academically poorer in morning classes and in overall 
performance,[24] have increased absenteeism and tardiness,[25] and a decreased ability to 
learn and retain material, actively participate in class, and perform decision-making tasks.[7, 
26, 27] Furthermore, sleep compromised adolescents are also more likely to be depressed, 
anxious, irritable, defiant, apathetic, and impulsive than adolescents who achieve optimal 
sleep.[28–31]
To address the public health issue of chronic sleep restriction among adolescents, schools 
have made efforts over the past 15 years to change start times to occur later in the morning 
to better align with adolescents’ circadian timing, social and environmental pressures, and to 
improve academic performance. Indeed, numerous cross-sectional and observational studies

 have suggested the benefit of delayed school start times. These studies usually compared one 
school district or class with another that used a later start time and revealed that adolescents 
in schools with later start times have less daytime sleepiness and sleep restriction,[8, 32–35] 
improved sleep quality,[36] better behavior, attention and concentration in class,[34, 35] less 
tardiness,[37] higher academic achievement in some[35, 38] but not all schools,[39] and 
fewer motor vehicle accidents.[21] The effects of later school start times compared favorably 
with other educational interventions in terms of overall cost and commensurate academic 
success.[40]
While these studies suggest improvements relative to other schools or classrooms, 
interpretation of these findings is limited because they do not include assessment of within-
subjects changes in sleep or other outcomes. Further, given the public advocacy for delayed 
school start times,[41] the recent policy statement from the American Academy of Pediatrics 
to delay the start of class to 8:30 a.m. or later,[42] and some estimates that over 80 U.S. 
school districts have already adopted later school start times,[43] a review of the 
experimental literature is needed. Although others have written reviews with a similar focus, 
one was published in a journal that was not peer-reviewed,[44] and a second consisted of a 
narrative review,[45] a method that is not systematic in terms of the literature search or 
appraisal of quantitative data. Further, the American Academy of Pediatrics policy statement 
has called for research to document the effects of changes in school start times over time.
[42] Thus, the purpose of this paper is to systematically review the evidence on the impact of 
delayed school start time interventions on students’ sleep, health, and academic outcomes.
Methods
Literature Search
We conducted a systematic review to synthesize the results of experimental research. The 
review began with a search of the literature to locate articles that used quantitative methods 
to assess the impact of delayed school start time interventions among youth. Relevant 
sources were identified by the first author through searches of the following electronic 
bibliographic databases in May 2014 with the assistance of a medical librarian to ensure 
balance of sensitivity and specificity: Ovid EMBASE, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid PsycINFO, 
Web of Science, Global Health, and CINAHL. The results were limited to full-article peer-
reviewed publications written in English. The search terms included the following keywords: 
“Students” AND “Schools OR Education” AND “Sleep Deprivation OR Sleep OR Circadian 
Rhythm OR School Start Time OR Start Time OR Start Late OR Start Delay OR Start 
Stagger OR Start Early OR Eveningness OR Wakefulness”. We did not search for 
intervention-related terms, as there is no clear way to capture intervention studies, especially 
those that do not use a randomized design. An example of the full search strategy is 
available (“See supplementary Table S1”). Results were not limited to chronological age of 
the student or year of publication. To identify any articles that may have been missed during 
the literature search, reference lists of candidate articles were reviewed, yielding no 
additional articles. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-
Analyses (PRISMA) reporting flowchart was used to document the literature search process 
(Figure 1).

 Study Selection Criteria
The titles and abstracts of all citations identified by the literature search were reviewed. 
Potentially relevant published articles reporting their selection criteria were retrieved. The 
selection criteria were specified in advance and included the following: 1) published in 
English in a peer-reviewed journal; 2) available in full-text; 3) primary or secondary school-
aged youth were the subject of research; 4) experimental study design (i.e. randomized 
controlled trial (RCT), quasi-experimental, pre-post no control); 5) reported total sleep time; 
and 6) studies that examined the impact of delayed school start time on the same subjects. 
Observational, correlational and descriptive studies were excluded, as were technical reports, 
reviews, editorials, unpublished manuscripts, dissertations, and abstracts. If multiple articles 
were available from a single study, the most recently published article or article containing 
the most comprehensive description of study characteristics was selected for review.
Article Review and Data Extraction
As suggested by a recent review of knowledge synthesis techniques,[46] the PRISMA 
reporting guideline was adopted for this article to improve transparency and reduce the risk 
of bias[47] (see Figure 1).
Data extraction was conducted by using a data display matrix to obtain reliable and 
consistent data from the primary studies. Information was extracted pertaining to study 
characteristics: author, year, country, study aim, school description (student body, type of 
school, location), sample description (mean age, age range, percent girls, percent non-white, 
sample size), study description (study design, sampling method, intervention intent (research 
study or policy change)), and intervention description (start time change, minutes of delayed 
start, treatment length, dates of data collection, sleep data collection instrument). A second 
data display matrix was created to extract data related to the study outcomes, including 
sleep-related outcomes (e.g. bed time, wake time, total sleep time (sleep duration), other 
sleep characteristics), health-related outcomes (e.g. body mass index (BMI), depression, 
psychosocial health, use of school nurse), and academic-related outcomes (e.g. academic 
achievement, tardiness, absenteeism, staying awake in class). Where reported, we extracted 
the results of statistical tests (95% confidence intervals or p-values) and considered the 
suitability for meta-analysis of the effects of delayed school start time on total sleep time. 
Additional information was extracted pertaining to group characteristics, including effects of 
delayed start time by gender, race/ethnicity, grade level, and day vs. boarding students. We 
also included evidence of non-significant findings.
Data Synthesis
Studies were categorized based on their year of publication and geographical affiliation. 
Where available, outcomes for each study were summarized and compared in terms of the 
net change in sleep, health, and academic characteristics. Due to significant variation in 
study designs, participants, and treatment lengths, we were unable to conduct a meta-
analysis. Furthermore, many studies failed to report confidence intervals for the main 
outcomes, thus we would have been unable to construct a forest plot.

 Results
Literature Search
A total of 1029 articles were identified and imported into Endnote software (Figure 1). 
Duplicates were removed via the Endnote duplicate function and any remaining duplicates 
were manually removed, leaving a total of 818 articles. A thorough review of all article titles 
and abstracts was conducted to identify articles to review in full-text (N = 24). The majority 
of articles excluded after review of their title or abstract was due to a cross-sectional design 
or not related to a delayed start time intervention. After full-text review, 18 of the 24 articles 
were excluded most often due to a non-experimental study design (e.g. observational, 
naturalistic, comparative design) or an ineligible intervention that assessed changes in school 
shifts, block scheduling, or the effects of a light intervention on melatonin. Thus, a final 
sample of 6 articles was identified for this review.
Characteristics of Selected Studies
The authors of all studies sought to examine the impact of a delayed school start time on at 
least one of the following outcomes: sleep characteristics (sleep patterns, sleepiness, sleep 
duration), attention performance, academic achievement, motor vehicle crashes, mood, and 
health-related outcomes (“See table 1”). The type of schools varied from private (n=2) to 
public (n=4) ownership and high school (n=4) to middle school (n=2). For those students 
enrolled in the primary studies, the mean sample size ranged from 47 to 10,656 with the 
majority of sample sizes fewer than 600 students. Participants’ mean age varied widely 
across studies, from 10.8 to 16.4 years, although all but one study had a mean age of 13 
years or older upon enrollment. In samples where the gender was reported, most had a slight 
oversampling of girls. Geographically, three studies were conducted in the United States and 
one each in China, Israel, and Norway.
Studies reported pre-post, no control (n=3), RCT (n=2), and quasi-experimental (n=1) 
designs. Most studies employed a convenience sampling recruitment technique. Two studies 
reported on the outcomes of a policy change in later school start times,[48, 49] whereas the 
remainder altered start times for experimental research purposes; it is unknown if the later 
start times were continued after the interventions concluded. All studies had a delayed start 
that ranged from 25 to 60 minutes, but treatment lengths varied from 1 week to 
indeterminate. Sleep-related data were collected by each study using a self-reported 
instrument, and one study also employed an objective measurement of sleep (i.e. 
actigraphy).
Outcomes
All six studies reported on the effect of delayed school start time on sleep outcomes; three 
reported on health-related outcomes; and five studies reported academic-related outcomes 
(“See table 2”).
Effects of Delayed School Start Time on Sleep
Total Sleep Time: All six studies reported the effects of delayed school start time on 
weekday total sleep time, the main outcome observed in our review. Relative to pre-

 intervention, there was a significant positive net change in all studies, indicating an increase 
in the total minutes of sleep. The net increase ranged from an additional 25 minutes to 77 
minutes (1:17) of sleep per weeknight. For those studies employing a control condition,[48, 
50, 51] there was a significant difference between intervention and control groups in total 
sleep time, with the intervention group having a longer sleep duration. This finding was 
confirmed by the one study that used actigraphy to objectively measure sleep, noting a net 
increase in total sleep time for intervention versus control condition (65 min. vs. −11 min., p 
≤ .01), and a sleep efficiency of 97% for the intervention group.[51]
Changes in weekend total sleep time were evaluated in three studies that used a pre-post, no 
control design.[49, 52, 53] The results were mixed in that two studies did not report a 
significant difference in weekend total sleep time, whereas one study reported a significant 
decrease of 48 minutes of weekend total sleep time.[49]
Bedtime: Five studies[48, 50–53] evaluated the effects of delayed school start times on 
bedtime. Three studies[48, 51, 52] found either no difference or earlier bedtimes in the 
intervention group before and after the delayed start time intervention. However, two studies 
reported a modest, but significant change in bedtimes, ranging from a later bedtime of 12 to 
14 minutes[50] to an earlier bedtime of 19 minutes.[53] Of these studies, those that used a 
randomized design[50] [48, 51] reported no significant difference in bedtime between the 
control and intervention groups after the delayed start time, suggesting students went to at 
the same time regardless of their assigned experimental condition.
Wake Time: Four studies reported the effect of delayed school start time on wake times,[48, 
50–53] and each found a significant net delay in wake times. Relative to pre-intervention 
assessments, wake times increased from 21 minutes to 66 minutes (1:06) later. One 
study[53] also reported on the effect of delayed school start time on weekend oversleep, or 
the difference between school day and non-school day wake times, and found a significant 
decrease of 33 minutes.
Daytime Sleepiness and Sleep Satisfaction: Five studies[48–50, 52, 53] evaluated the 
effect of delayed start times on measures of daytime sleepiness, including overall sleepiness, 
napping and assistance required to wake up in the morning (e.g. alarm clock). Each study 
found a significant improvement in measures of daytime sleepiness, with the exception of 
one that found no significant difference between intervention and control groups in 
improvements of daytime sleepiness.[48] Owens and colleagues reported change in sleep 
satisfaction and found significant improvements in perceptions of getting a good night’s 
sleep, getting enough sleep, being satisfied with sleep, and fewer sleep-wake behavior 
problems.[53]
Effects of Delayed School Start Time on Health-related Outcomes
Healthcare Utilization: One study[52] reported no significant decrease in the number of 
visits to a school clinic for fatigue-related symptoms. Yet another study[53] reported 
significantly fewer visits to the health clinic to rest (69 to 30 visits) and for fatigue-related

 symptoms (15.3% to 4.6%) upon post-intervention assessment. However, the authors of this 
study found no significant difference in number of physician visits.
Depression and Affect: Two studies[52, 53] that used a pre-post, no control design found 
significant decreases in the depression scale, depressed mood score, and proportion of 
students who were irritated or annoyed relative to post-intervention. However, one quasi-
experimental study[48] did not find a significant difference between the intervention and 
control groups in terms of positive or negative affect.
BMI: One study conducted by Li and colleagues evaluated the effects of delayed school 
start time on BMI. The authors found a decrease in BMI for the intervention groups and an 
increase in the control group, but this finding was not statistically significant.[50]
Caffeine Use: One study[52] reported the effect of delayed school start time on weekly 
caffeine use and found a significant decrease in the consumption of caffeinated beverages 
per week (7.62 to 5.89 beverages per week, p<.05).
Effects of Delayed School Start Time on Academic Outcomes
Academic Achievement, Attendance, and Attention: The two studies[52, 53] that 
evaluated the effects of delayed school start times on academic achievement found no 
significant difference in self-reported grades of B or higher from pre- to post-intervention. 
However, these two studies reported significant declines in tardiness, presenteeism 
(struggling to stay awake during class), and Owens and colleagues reported declines in 
falling asleep during class and arriving late to class due to oversleeping.[53] Both studies 
also found that significantly fewer students reported being too tired to complete schoolwork 
from pre- to post-intervention. However, one other study found no significant difference in 
the amount of hours students spent on homework.[49]
In addition, one other study found significant improvements in attention levels in class 
following the delayed school start time.[51] Another noted improved reaction test time when 
comparing control and intervention groups post-intervention.[48]
Extracurricular Activities: The two studies[49, 52] that evaluated the effects of delayed 
school start times on whether students were too tired to play sports found no significant 
change. Similarly, Danner & Phillips (2008) examined a number of other extracurricular 
activities, and found no significant difference in terms of participation in music activities, 
volunteer work, or socializing with friends from pre- to post-intervention. The latter findings 
was also noted by Boergers and colleagues.[52]
Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review conducted to evaluate and examine the 
effect of delayed school start times on sleep, health and academic parameters. Our review of 
primary experimental studies published in peer-reviewed journals provides initial, 
cumulative evidence that delaying school start times can be an effective method to improve 
important sleep outcomes, such as total sleep time and reduce daytime sleepiness; health

 outcomes, including reduced depression and caffeine use; and academic outcomes, such as 
tardiness and staying awake in class. These findings suggest that delayed school start times 
can increase sleep duration in adolescence with corresponding effects on markers of 
improved health and classroom engagement and behavior. To achieve these outcomes, we 
support the recent American Academy of Pediatrics policy statement[42] to delay middle 
and high school start times to 8:30 a.m. or later to become congruent with evening 
preference chronotype during adolescent years.[1]
Despite the range of outcomes each study reported, all of the studies reported total sleep 
time and observed a significant increase in sleep duration. The number of minutes school 
was delayed ranged from 25 to 60 minutes, and correspondingly, students’ increased their 
total sleep time from 25 to 77 minutes, suggesting a clinically meaningful dose-response 
relationship. Importantly, among the studies that examined bedtimes and wake times, 
authors found delays only in wake times while bedtimes had either no change or were 
earlier. This provides evidence countering the hypothesis that students will simply stay 
awake later if school start time is delayed, and verifies the developmental shift in circadian 
timing that favors phase delay during later childhood.[8] Increased sleep duration also 
contributed to reductions in daytime sleepiness (e.g. napping, overall sleepiness), which has 
implications for enhancing engagement in learning and achieving success in school due to 
improved cognitive functioning, problem solving, attention, decision-making, memory and 
creativity.[2, 7, 26, 27, 37, 54, 55]
Consistent with these explanations, our review found improved school-related outcomes 
following a delayed school start time intervention including decreased tardiness, 
presenteeism, falling asleep in class, being too tired to do homework, and improved reaction 
time; similar result have been observed in cross-sectional or observational studies employing 
a non-experimental design.[7, 21, 26] Interestingly, the finding that sleep duration did not 
change or significantly decreased for total weekend sleep time after the intervention suggests 
that students were not “binge-sleeping” and did not experience the jet-lag effect associated 
with weekend oversleep due to accumulated sleep debt over the course of the week, which 
has been shown to adversely impact school performance.[55] Delayed school start times also 
improved reaction time, which has implications for mitigating drowsy driving-related motor 
vehicle accidents. For instance, one observational study comparing two neighboring school 
districts in Virginia found student drowsy driving-related car crashes were 41% higher in the 
district that did not have a 75-minute delayed start.[21]
Although surrogate markers of academic achievement significantly improved relative to 
baseline or control condition, the two studies examining changes in self-reported grades 
found no overall improvement. However, because the findings were derived from self-report 
data and occurred in private boarding schools, results may be biased or not generalizable to 
the general population. Nonetheless, since students’ academic success, and public school 
funding, is often predicated on grades and standardized testing scores, and non-experimental 
studies provide initial evidence that adolescents with better grades have a longer sleep 
duration,[6] the importance of testing these outcomes in future studies cannot be overstated.

 Overall findings regarding changes in health-related outcomes were mixed with some 
studies reporting no change in health care utilization for fatigue-related visits and no change 
in BMI, while others observed a significant reduction in depression and caffeine use. 
However, too few studies were available to make substantive inferences in this domain. To 
illustrate this point, one study reported a decrease in BMI for the youth who had a delayed 
school start time compared with the control condition.[50] However, this finding was not 
statistically significant.
Despite the benefits of later school start times, school districts may encounter barriers 
related to modifying transportation schedules and the associated costs, for families where 
older siblings provide childcare for younger sibling, and delay of sports, social activities, 
part-time employment, and other afterschool extracurricular activities.[45, 56] With regard 
to the latter concern, our study found no difference following the delayed start time 
intervention among those studies that examined participation in afterschool activities. 
Another concern is that students may stay awake later in order to complete homework or 
socialize, however two of the reviewed studies found that significantly fewer students 
reported being too tired to complete schoolwork from pre- to post-intervention, and no 
studies found students went to bed at a later time following the intervention. Nevertheless, 
instituting a delay in school start times is achievable with sufficient strategizing and 
preparation[45], as demonstrated by several school districts[57, 58], and internet-based 
resources exist that address these barriers and provide guidance for school districts 
considering implementing a later school start time policy (e.g. www.SchoolStartTime.org; 
www.StartSchoolLater.net). Involving key players and gaining support of adolescents, 
parents, teachers, coaches, administrators, transportation directors, sleep professionals, and 
school boards is critical to ensuring success.
However, before suggestions are heeded for widespread dissemination and implementation 
of delaying school start times, additional experimental and more rigorous research is needed 
to determine the effectiveness of delayed school start times. Although the studies included in 
this review provide evidence that delayed school start times improve total sleep time, half of 
the studies had a non-randomized study design, and most lacked a reliable and objective 
measure of sleep. Furthermore, few studies examined the same outcomes in terms of health 
indicators (i.e., BMI) or academic parameters (i.e., test scores) to comment extensively on 
those outcomes. In light of these limitations, future studies ought to incorporate a 
randomized study design, use objective measures to quantify sleep architecture and duration 
(i.e., actigraphy), and examine the impact of delayed school start time on diverse student 
populations as well as changes in sleep architecture. Results of outcomes including total 
sleep time, BMI and academic performance, in particular, are warranted to assess whether 
delayed school start time can improve test scores while also serving as a mechanism of 
obesity prevention, and provide robust evidence to advocate for a national public policy 
debate on delaying school start times.
In addition to the methodological limitations of the primary studies included in this review, 
our findings must be interpreted in the context of the following limitations. First, although 
exhaustive search methods were used to eliminate any potential bias, it is possible that not 
all quantitative studies were identified. In addition, the exclusion of unpublished and grey

 literature may have contributed an element of publication bias, with potential implications 
for the robustness of the findings, but such studies may have lower methodological 
quality[59] and likely would not have used a within-subjects design. Furthermore, the school 
characteristics were omitted from several of the reviewed studies, potentially influencing the 
generalizability of the findings to other contexts.
In summary, the cumulative evidence from our systematic review indicates that delayed 
school start time interventions increase total sleep time, and correspondingly, wake times, 
therefore presenting a potential long-term solution to chronic sleep restriction during 
adolescence. This study also verifies the wealth of non-experimental research suggesting the 
importance of delayed school start times, particularly during adolescence, to improve 
cognitive performance, academic functioning, mood and health; all faculties that affect 
students, as well as their peers, teachers, and families. Nonetheless, additional experimental 
research is needed to examine the effectiveness of these interventions on academic and 
health outcomes.

 Practice Points
Delaying middle and high school start time to 8:30am or later can be an effective method 
to:
1.
improve important sleep outcomes in adolescence, including weeknight 
total sleep time and reduce daytime sleepiness;
2.
improve health and academic outcomes, such as depression, caffeine use, 
tardiness to class and staying awake in class; and
3.
circumvent changes in weeknight bedtime or reduced participation in 
extracurricular activities.

 Research Agenda
Future studies of delayed school start time are needed to:
1.
examine the effectiveness of delaying school start time on sleep, health, and 
academic outcomes using a randomized study design;
2.
assess academic- and BMI-related outcomes in public school settings;
3.
use objective measures to quantify sleep architecture and duration; and
4.
examine the facilitators and barriers schools encounter when adopting a 
later school start time.
