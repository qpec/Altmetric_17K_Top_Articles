Great American Smokeout —
November 17, 2016
The American Cancer Society Great American 
Smokeout is an annual event that encourages smokers to 
make a plan to quit or to plan in advance and quit smok-
ing on that day (1). The 41st annual Great American 
Smokeout will be held on November 17, 2016.
In the more than 50 years since the Surgeon General’s 
first report on smoking and health, cigarette smoking 
among U.S. adults has been reduced by approximately 
half. However, since 1964, an estimated 20 million persons 
have died because of smoking, which remains the leading 
preventable cause of disease, disability, and death in the 
United States (2).
About two out of three adult smokers want to quit smok-
ing cigarettes, and approximately half of smokers made a 
quit attempt in the preceding year (2). However, in 2015, an 
estimated 15.1% of U.S. adults (approximately 36.5 million 
persons) were current cigarette smokers (3). Getting effective 
help through counseling and medications can increase the 
chances of quitting by as much as threefold (4).
Additional information and support for quitting smoking is 
available by telephone at 800-QUIT-NOW (800-784-8669). 
CDC’s Tips From Former Smokers campaign offers addi-
tional quit resources at http://www.cdc.gov/tips.

Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable disease and 
death in the United States, and cigarettes are the most com-
monly used tobacco product among U.S. adults (1,2). To assess 
progress toward achieving the Healthy People 2020 target of 
reducing the proportion of U.S. adults who smoke cigarettes 
to ≤12.0% (objective TU1.1),* CDC assessed the most recent 
national estimates of cigarette smoking prevalence among

adults aged ≥18 years using data from the 2015 National 
Health Interview Survey (NHIS). The proportion of U.S. 
adults who smoke cigarettes declined from 20.9% in 2005 to 
15.1% in 2015, and the proportion of daily smokers declined 
from 16.9% to 11.4%. However, disparities in cigarette smok-
ing persist. In 2015, prevalence of cigarette smoking was higher 
among adults who were male; were aged 25–44 years; were 
American Indian/Alaska Native; had a General Education 
Development certificate (GED); lived below the federal poverty 
level; lived in the Midwest; were insured through Medicaid or 
were uninsured; had a disability/limitation; were lesbian, gay, 
or bisexual; or who had serious psychological distress. Proven 
population-based interventions, including tobacco price 
increases, comprehensive smoke-free laws, anti-tobacco mass 
media campaigns, and barrier-free access to tobacco cessation 
counseling and medications, are critical to reducing cigarette 
smoking and smoking-related disease and death among U.S. 
adults, particularly among subpopulations with the highest 
smoking prevalences (3).
NHIS is an annual, nationally representative, in-person 
survey of the noninstitutionalized U.S. civilian population. 
The NHIS sample adult core questionnaire is administered 
to a randomly selected (sample) adult in the household, and, 
in 2015, included 33,672 adults aged ≥18 years; the response 
rate was 55.2%. Current cigarette smokers were adults who 
smoked ≥100 cigarettes during their lifetime and, at the time 
of interview, reported smoking every day or on some days.
Data were weighted to adjust for differences in the prob-
abilities of selection and nonresponse, and to provide nationally 
representative estimates. Current smoking was assessed overall 
and by sex, age, race/ethnicity, education, poverty status,† 
U.S. region,§ health insurance coverage at the time of survey,¶ 
† Based on reported family income: 2005 estimates are based on reported family 
income and 2004 poverty thresholds published by the U.S. Census Bureau, 
and 2015 estimates are based on reported family income and 2014 poverty 
thresholds published by the U.S. Census Bureau.

disability/limitation status,** sexual orientation,†† and seri-
ous psychological distress status§§. Two different measures 
for psychological distress were assessed (e.g., a dichotomous 
(yes/no) measure for serious psychological distress, and a 
four-category (no, low, moderate, or high) measure for the 
degree of psychological distress.¶¶ The mean number of ciga-
rettes smoked per day was calculated among daily smokers. 
Differences between groups were assessed using a Wald test, 
with statistical significance defined as p<0.05. Logistic regres-
sion was used to assess linear trends using annual NHIS data 
from 2005–2015. Relative percentage changes in prevalence 
rates during 2005–2015 were calculated.***
Current cigarette smoking among U.S. adults declined from 
20.9% (an estimated 45.1 million adults) in 2005 to 15.1% 
(36.5 million) in 2015, a 27.7% decline (p for trend <0.05) 
(Figure 1). During 2005–2015, significant declines in smoking 
prevalence were observed among all subgroups by sex, poverty 
status, and U.S. region (p<0.05) (Table).
Current cigarette smoking was significantly lower in 2015 
(15.1%) than in 2014 (16.8%) (p<0.05); however, there 
were differences in smoking prevalence by sex, age group, 
race/ethnicity, educational attainment, economic status, U.S. 
region, insurance and disability status, sexual orientation, and 
serious psychological distress status. In 2015, current cigarette 
smoking prevalence was higher among males (16.7%) than 
females (13.6%) and among adults aged 25–44 years (17.7%) 
than those aged ≥65 years (8.4%). Prevalence was highest 
among American Indian/Alaska Natives (21.9%) and was more 
than three times the prevalence among non-Hispanic Asians, 
who had the lowest prevalence (7.0%). Among adults aged 
≥25 years, prevalences ranged from a high of 34.1% among 
persons with a GED to a low of 3.6% among persons with a 
graduate degree. Prevalence among persons living below the 
poverty level (26.1%) was nearly twice that of persons at or 
above this level (13.9%). By region, the highest prevalence 
was in the Midwest (18.7%) and lowest was in the West 
(12.4%). Smoking prevalence was higher among Medicaid 
enrollees (27.8%) and uninsured persons (27.4%) than 
among persons covered by private health insurance (11.1%) 
or by Medicare only (8.9%), and higher among adults with a 
disability/limitation (21.5%) than among adults reporting no 
disability/limitation (13.8%). In addition, reported smoking 
prevalence was higher among adults who were lesbian, gay, or 
bisexual (20.6%) than heterosexual adults (14.9%). In 2015, 
persons with serious psychological distress reported a higher 
smoking prevalence (40.6%) than did persons without serious 
psychological distress (14.0%) (Table). Among adults with high 
psychological distress, prevalence was highest among persons 
aged 25–44 years (44.3%) and lowest among persons aged ≥65 
years (18.9%) (Figure 2).
Among current smokers during 2005–2015, the number 
of daily smokers decreased from 36.5 million (80.8%) to

* Persons who reported smoking ≥100 cigarettes during their lifetime and who, 
at the time of interview, reported smoking every day or some days.
 ** Disability/limitation was defined based on self-reported presence of selected 
impairments including vision, hearing, cognition, and movement. 
Limitations in performing activities of daily living was defined based on 
response to the question, “Does [person] have difficulty dressing or bathing?” 
Limitations in performing instrumental activities of daily living defined 
based on response to the question, “Because of a physical, mental, or 
emotional condition, does [person] have difficulty doing errands alone such 
as visiting a doctor’s office or shopping?” Any disability/limitation was defined 
as a “yes” response pertaining to at least one of the disabilities/limitations 
listed (e.g., vision, hearing, cognition, movement, activities of daily living, 
or instrumental activities of daily living). A random sample of half the 
respondents from the 2015 Person File were asked about disability/limitation.
 †† Starting in 2013, sexual orientation questions were added to NHIS for the 
first time. To determine sexual orientation, adult respondents were asked, 
“Which of the following best represents how you think of yourself?” with a 
response options of: “gay” (“lesbian or gay” for female respondents), 
“heterosexual,” that is, “not gay” (“not lesbian or gay” for female respondents), 
“bisexual,” “something else,” and “I don’t know the answer.”
 §§ The six-question Kessler (K6) scale was developed to identify persons with a 
high likelihood of having a diagnosable mental illness and associated functional 
limitations. The K6 scale asked how often during the past 30 days the 
respondents felt a) “so sad that nothing could cheer them up”; b) “nervous”; 
c) “restless or fidgety”; d) “hopeless”; e) “that everything was an effort”; or 
f) “worthless.” Responses were on a five-point Likert scale ranging from none 
of the time to all of the time. For each question, a value of zero, one, two, 
three, or four was assigned to the response: “none of the time,” “a little of the 
time,” “some of the time,” “most of the time,” or “all of the time,” respectively. 
Responses to the six items were summed to yield a K6 score of 0–24, with 
higher scores indicating greater psychological distress. Additional information 
available at https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db203.pdf.
 ¶¶ Based on K6 scale, the degree of psychological distress is presented as a four-
category measure with no psychological distress (score = 0), low psychological 
distress (score = 1–5), moderate psychological distress (score = 6–10), and 
high psychological distress (score = 11–24) (http://www.samhsa.gov/data/

some days increased from 8.7 million (19.2%) to 8.9 million 
(24.3%) (p for trend <0.05). Among daily smokers, the mean 
number of cigarettes smoked per day declined from 16.7 in 
2005 to 14.2 in 2015 (p for trend <0.05), but did not change 
significantly between 2014 (13.8 per day) and 2015 (14.2 
per day). Moreover, despite an increase in the proportion of 
daily smokers who smoked 1–9 cigarettes per day since 2012, 
this proportion did not change significantly between 2014 
(26.9%) and 2015 (25.1%). Similarly, during 2014–2015, no 
significant change occurred in the proportion of daily smokers 
who smoked 20–29 cigarettes per day (27.4% to 29.3%) or 
≥30 cigarettes per day (6.9% to 6.8%) (Figure 3).
Discussion
During 2005–2015, the prevalence of cigarette smoking 
among U.S. adults declined from 20.9% to 15.1%, including 
a 1.7 percentage point reduction during 2014–2015 alone, 
indicating progress toward achieving the Healthy People 2020 
goal of reducing cigarette smoking prevalence to ≤12.0%. 
However, 36.5 million U.S. adults currently smoke ciga-
rettes, and disparities in smoking prevalence persist. Cigarette 
smoking prevalence was higher among adults who are male; 
younger; American Indian/Alaska Native; have less education; 
live below the federal poverty level; live in the Midwest or

South; are insured through Medicaid or are uninsured; have 
a disability/limitation; are lesbian, gay, or bisexual; or have 
serious psychological distress. Moreover, after declines during 
previous years, the mean number of cigarettes smoked per day 
among daily smokers did not change significantly from 2014 
to 2015. The Surgeon General has concluded that the burden 
of death and disease from tobacco use in the United States is 
overwhelmingly caused by cigarettes and other combusted 
tobacco products (1). Accordingly, enhanced and sustained 
implementation of proven population-level interventions, 
including tobacco price increases, anti-tobacco mass media 
campaigns, comprehensive smoke-free laws, and enhanced 
access to help in quitting tobacco use, are critical to reducing 
smoking-related disease and death in the United States (3).
Efforts to address the disparities noted in this report are 
crucial to further reducing smoking prevalence in the United 
States (1). Differences in smoking by race/ethnicity might be 
partly explained by sociocultural influences, and disparities 
by education might be partly attributable to variations in the 
understanding of the range of health hazards caused by smok-
ing (4,5). Differences by health insurance coverage might be 
partly attributable to variations in tobacco cessation coverage 
and access to evidence-based cessation treatments across insur-
ance types (6). Consistent with previous research, smoking 
prevalence was higher among persons with high or serious 
psychological distress (7,8), which could be partly explained 
by higher levels of addiction and dependence, lack of financial 
resources, less access to cessation treatments, and stressful liv-
ing conditions among these persons (7,8). Many smokers with 
behavioral health problems would like to quit and are able to 
quit with assistance (8,9). Assessing the smoking status of all 
patients served in psychiatric inpatient and outpatient settings, 
and integrating evidence-based cessation interventions such as

 *** Disability/limitation was defined based on self-reported presence of selected impairments including vision, hearing, cognition, and movement. Limitations in performing activities of 
daily living were defined based on response to the question, “Does [person] have difficulty dressing or bathing?” Limitations in performing instrumental activities of daily living were 
defined based on response to the question, “Because of a physical, mental, or emotional condition, does [person] have difficulty doing errands alone such as visiting a doctor’s office or 
shopping?” Any disability/limitation was defined as a “yes” response pertaining to at least one of the disabilities/limitations listed (i.e., vision, hearing, cognition, movement, activities of 
daily living, or instrumental activities of daily living). A random sample of half of the respondents from the 2015 Person File were asked about disability/limitation.
 ††† Questions pertaining to disabilities/limitations and sexual orientation were not included in the 2005 National Health Interview Survey.

 ¶¶¶ The Kessler psychological distress scale is a series of six questions that ask about feelings of sadness, nervousness, restlessness, worthlessness, and feeling like everything is an effort in the 
past 30 days. Participants were asked to respond on a Likert Scale ranging between “None of the time” (score = 0) and “All of the time” (score = 4). Responses were summed over the six 
questions; any person with a score of ≥13 were coded as having serious psychological distress, and respondents with a score <13 were coded as not having serious psychological distress.

counseling and medications into mental health treatment plans 
could help reduce smoking prevalence in this population (7,8).
The findings in this report are subject to at least four limita-
tions. First, smoking status was self-reported and was not vali-
dated by biochemical testing; however, self-reported smoking 
status correlates highly with serum cotinine levels (10). Second, 
because NHIS does not include institutionalized populations 
and persons in the military, results are not generalizable to these 
groups. Third, the NHIS response rate of 55.2% might have 
resulted in nonresponse bias. Finally, these estimates might 
differ from those in other surveys. These differences can be 
partially explained by varying survey methodologies, types 
of surveys administered, and definitions of current smoking; 
however, trends in prevalence are comparable across surveys (1).
Sustained comprehensive state tobacco control programs 
funded at CDC-recommended levels could accelerate progress 
in reducing adult smoking prevalence and smoking-related 
disease, death, and economic costs (3). However, during 2016, 
despite combined revenues of $25.8 billion from settlement 
payments and tobacco taxes in all states, state spending on 
tobacco control programs is projected to be $468 million (1.8% 
of revenues),††† representing <15% of the CDC-recommended 
level of funding for all states combined (3). Implementation 
of comprehensive tobacco control interventions can result in 
substantial reductions in tobacco-related disease and death and 
billions of dollars in savings from averted medical costs (1). In 
particular, the health care system offers important opportuni-
ties to reduce smoking, especially for vulnerable populations, 
by implementing system changes to make tobacco dependence 
treatment a standard of care and by working with health insur-
ers to cover evidence-based cessation treatments with minimal 
barriers and to promote their use (3,6).

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable disease and 
death in the United States, and cigarettes are the most com-
monly used tobacco product among U.S. adults.
What is added by this report?
The proportion of U.S. adults who smoke cigarettes declined 
from 20.9% in 2005 (45.1 million smokers) to 15.1% in 2015 
(36.5 million smokers), and the proportion of daily smokers 
declined from 16.9% to 11.4%. However, disparities in cigarette 
smoking persist; for example, in 2015, cigarette smoking 
prevalence was higher among persons who have serious 
psychological distress (40.6%) than among persons without 
serious psychological distress (14.0%).
What are the implications for public health practice?
Proven population-based interventions, including tobacco price 
increases, comprehensive smoke-free laws, anti-tobacco mass 
media campaigns, and barrier-free access to tobacco cessation 
counseling and medications, are critical to reducing cigarette 
smoking and smoking-related disease and death among U.S. 
adults, particularly among subpopulations with the highest 
smoking prevalence.
