IMPORTANCE Whether a reported decline in the risk of developing age-related macular
degeneration (AMD) continued for people born during the Baby Boom years (1946-1964)
or later is unknown. These data are important to plan for ocular health care needs in the
21st century.
OBJECTIVES To determine whether the 5-year risk for AMD declined by generation and to
identify factors that contributed to improvement in risk.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Data came from the longitudinal cohort Beaver Dam
Eye Study (March 1, 1988, through September 15, 1990, and March 1, 1993, through June 15,
1995) and the Beaver Dam Offspring Study (June 8, 2005, through August 4, 2008, and
July 12, 2010, through March 21, 2013). These population-based studies examined residents
of Beaver Dam, Wisconsin, aged 43 to 84 years in 1987 through 1988 and their adult offspring
aged 21 to 84 years in 2005 through 2008. A total of 4819 participants were at risk for
developing AMD based on fundus images obtained at baseline visits. Data were analyzed
from February 18, 2016, through June 22, 2017, with additional analyses ending September
22, 2017.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Fundus images were graded for AMD using the Wisconsin
Age-related Maculopathy Grading System. The incidence of AMD was defined as the
presence at the 5-year follow-up examination of pure geographic atrophy or exudative
macular degeneration, any type of drusen with pigmentary abnormalities, or soft indistinct
drusen without pigmentary abnormalities.
RESULTS Among the 4819 participants, the mean (SD) baseline age of the cohort was 54 (11)
years; 2117 were men (43.9%) and 2702 were women (56.1%). The 5-year age- and
sex-adjusted incidence of AMD was 8.8% in the Greatest Generation (born during 1901-1924),
3.0% in the Silent Generation (born during 1925-1945), 1.0% in the Baby Boom Generation
(born during 1946-1964), and 0.3% in Generation X (born during 1965-1984). Adjusting for
age and sex, each generation was more than 60% less likely to develop AMD than the
previous generation (relative risk, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.24-0.46). The generational association
(relative risk, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.28 to 0.57) remained significant after adjusting for age, sex,
smoking, educational attainment, exercise, levels of non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol
and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,
statins, and multivitamins.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The 5-year risk for AMD declined by birth cohorts throughout
the 20th century. Factors that explain this decline in risk are not known. However, this
pattern is consistent with reported declines in risks for cardiovascular disease and dementia,
suggesting that aging Baby Boomers may experience better retinal health at older ages than
did previous generations.

 T
he US population experienced increases in longevity
during the 20th century. The estimated life expec-
tancy was 59 years for white people born in the United
States in 1921, 69 years by midcentury, and 77 years by the end
of the century.1 In the United States, because of this in-
creased life expectancy and the advent of the Baby Boom
Generation (1946-1964), estimates suggest that large num-
bers of adults will experience age-related macular degenera-
tion (AMD), the leading cause of blindness in older adults, in-
creasing the need for vision care for older adults.2 However,
in addition to living longer, older adults appear to have better
health than did previous generations. Declines in the risk for
cardiovasculardisease,3,4dementias,5-7andotherchroniccon-
ditions of aging8,9 have been reported for people born in the
first half of the 20th century. The prevalence and 5-year inci-
dence of AMD declined by birth cohort from 1903 to 1942 in
theBeaverDamEyeStudy(BDES).10However,whethertherisk
for AMD has declined for the Baby Boom generation, who are
now turning 65 years of age at the rate of 10 000 individuals
per day, remains unknown.11
Rapid declines in the incidence of noncommunicable dis-
eases are considered to be strong evidence that such diseases
are partially preventable, because the effect of genetic change
is slow and difficult to detect.8 During the 20th century, tre-
mendous changes occurred in sanitation; housing; occupa-
tional safety; air and water quality and other environmental
exposures; lifestyle and behavioral factors; availability, qual-
ity, and safety of food sources; and socioeconomic condi-
tions; in addition, advances in the treatment and prevention
of medical conditions and infectious diseases occurred. Such
changes may have contributed to these improvements in risks
for noncommunicable diseases across generations.12,13 How-
ever, with increasing obesity and sedentary lifestyles, expo-
sures to new products and medications, and challenging eco-
nomicconditionsthatmayhaveunrecognizedhealthrisks,the
gains made in some health conditions in previous genera-
tions may be slowing, flattening, or disappearing, and people
born during the Baby Boom years and more recently may not
continue to experience healthier aging than their parents.14-16
The Beaver Dam Offspring Study (BOSS), which began
June 8, 2005, has been following up the adult offspring (born
during 1926-1984) of the Epidemiology of Hearing Loss
Study, an ancillary study of the BDES cohort (born during
1902-1946).10,17,18 The purpose of the present study was to ana-
lyze the 5-year incidence of AMD by generation to determine
whether the risk for AMD continued to decline for people born
during the Baby Boom years or later and to identify factors that
contributed to improvement in risk.
Methods
Analyses included data from 2 longitudinal cohort studies that
measured the 5-year incidence of AMD: the BDES and the
BOSS.10,17 The BDES is a population-based cohort study of resi-
dents of the city and town of Beaver Dam, Wisconsin, aged 43
to 84 years in 1987 to 1988.10 Participants without AMD at the
baseline examinations from March 1, 1988, through Septem-
ber 15, 1990 (at risk of developing AMD), and with 5-year fol-
low-up data from March 1, 1993, through June 15, 1995
(n = 2746), were included in these analyses. The BOSS exam-
ined the adult children (21 years or older) of the Epidemiol-
ogy of Hearing Loss Study cohort from June 8, 2005, through
August 4, 2008.17,18 BOSS participants without AMD at base-
line and with 5-year follow-up data from July 12, 2010, through
March 21, 2013 (n = 2073), were included in these analyses. Re-
tention of the at-risk group was high; 5274 of 6200 persons
(85%) returned for the 5-year follow-up visit, and of those re-
turning, 4819 (91.4%) had gradable images. Approval for this
research was obtained from the health sciences institutional
review board of the University of Wisconsin–Madison, and in-
formed written consent was obtained from all participants be-
fore each examination.
Similar standardized protocols were used in both studies
at each examination.10,17 In the BDES, 30° color fundus pho-
tographs centered on the disc (Early Treatment of Diabetic
Retinopathy Study [ETDRS] standard field 1) and macula
(ETDRS standard field 2) were taken of each eye through
pharmacologically dilated pupils. In the BOSS, 45° 8.2-
megapixel digital fundus images (ETDRS standard fields 1
and 2) were obtained through pharmacologically dilated
pupils (Cgi-45NM fundus camera; Canon Inc). Images were
graded by the University of Wisconsin Ocular Epidemiology
Reading Center using the Wisconsin Age-Related Maculopa-
thy Grading System.19 Previous studies have demonstrated
that results from the 2 imaging methods are comparable.20
Among participants without AMD at the baseline visit, inci-
dent AMD was defined as the presence of pure geographic
atrophy or exudative macular degeneration, any type of dru-
sen with pigmentary abnormalities, or soft indistinct drusen
without pigmentary abnormalities.
Measures of retinal vessel caliber were obtained using Ivan
software (Fundus Photograph Reading Center, Department of
Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, University of Wisconsin–
Madison) from fundus images centered on the optic disc. In-
dividual arterioles and venules were measured from the reti-
nal images according to standardized methods. The mean
calibers of retinal arterioles and venules were summarized as
the central retinal arteriolar equivalent and the central reti-
nal venular equivalent.21
Key Points
Question Has the risk for age-related macular degeneration
declined for people born in the latter half of the 20th century?
Findings In this longitudinal cohort study of the incidence of
age-related macular degeneration among 4819 participants, the
risk declined by 60% for each successive generation. Members of
the Baby Boom Generation was less likely to develop age-related
macular degeneration than members of the Silent or the Greatest
generations.
Meaning This dramatic decline in the incidence of age-related
macular degeneration suggests that aging Baby Boomers may
experience better retinal health longer than did previous
generations.

 Standardized questionnaires administered as interviews
were used to obtain lifestyle, behavioral medical history, and
medication data. Age was defined at the baseline examina-
tion. Generations were defined by year of birth as the Great-
est Generation (857 participants born during 1901-1924), the
Silent Generation (2068 participants born during 1925-1945),
Baby Boom Generation (1424 participants born during 1946-
1964), and Generation X (470 participants born during 1965-
1984). Smoking status was based on self-report of past, cur-
rent, or never smoking. Heavy alcohol consumption was
defined as ever consuming 4 or more alcoholic beverages
daily. Hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure of
140 mm Hg or higher, diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg
or higher, or currently taking blood pressure medication.
Height and weight were measured at the examination; obe-
sity was defined as a body mass index (calculated as weight
in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) of 30 or
greater. Diabetes status was defined as a self-report of a phy-
sician diagnosis or an elevated hemoglobin A1c level of at
least 6.5% (to convert to a proportion of total hemoglobin,
multiply by 0.01). Exercise was defined as engaging at least
once a week in physical activity long enough to work up a
sweat. Participants self-reported use of multivitamins, stat-
ins, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).
Time spent outdoors in summer was used as an indicator of
baseline sunlight exposure.
Serum total and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) choles-
terol levels were measured on nonfasting samples. Non-HDL
cholesterol level was calculated. Baseline serum high-
sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and interleukin 6 (IL-6)
assays were performed at the same laboratory at the Univer-
sity of Minnesota.22 Baseline BDES hsCRP level was mea-
sured using a latex particle–enhanced immunoturbidmetric
method (Kamiya Biomedical Company) read on a chemistry
analyzer(RocheHitachi911;RocheDiagnostics).BaselineBOSS
hsCRP levels were measured using a latex particle–enhanced
immunoturbidimetric assay from Roche Diagnostics read on
another chemistry analyzer (Roche Modular P800 Chemistry
Analyze; Roche Diagnostics). For both methods, the refer-
ence range was 0 to 5 mg/L (to convert to nanomoles per liter,
multiply by 9.524); sensitivity, 0.1 mg/L; and interassay coef-
ficientofvariation,4.5%.BaselinehsCRPlevelwasdividedinto
risk groups of less than 1.0, 1.0 to 3.0, and greater than 3.0
mg/L.22 Baseline serum IL-6 level was measured using the
quantitativesandwichenzymeimmunoassaytechnique(high-
sensitivity Quantikine kit; R&D Systems). The IL-6 reference
range was 0.45 to 9.96 pg/mL, and the laboratory interassay
coefficient of variation was 11.7%. The IL-6 levels were ana-
lyzed as tertiles.
Analyses were conducted using SAS software (version 9.4;
SAS Institute, Inc). Exact binomial CIs were calculated for in-
cidence estimates by age group and overall. Age- and sex-
adjusted relative risk (RR) estimates associated with baseline
risk factors were calculated using a modified Poisson regres-
sion approach with a robust error variance.23 This approach
was used to estimate the RR associated with each successive
generation in an age- and sex-adjusted model and a multivari-
able-adjusted model. In these models, generation was treated
asanorderedfactor,resultinginestimatedRRsassociatedwith
one generation compared with the previous generation. Esti-
mated 5-year incidence estimates by generation and by gen-
eration and age were plotted from models using the same ap-
proach. Similar models were built using indicator variables for
generation.
Results
Among the 4819 participants, 2117 were men (43.9%) and 2702
were women (56.1%); the mean (SD) age at baseline was 54 (11)
years. The overall 5-year incidence of AMD was 4.2% (204
cases) (Table 1) and increased by age group from 1 of 363 par-
ticipants (0.3%) younger than 40 years to 10 of 51 partici-
pants (19.6%) aged 80 to 86 years at baseline. Baseline char-
acteristics of those who developed incident AMD and those
who remained free of AMD are shown in Table 2. Adjusting for
age and sex, there were no associations between smoking, dia-
betes, hypertension, obesity, exercise, history of heavy alco-
hol consumption, levels of hsCRP and IL-6, nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory drug use, central retinal arteriolar and venular
equivalents, or sunlight exposure and the incidence of AMD.

tivitaminuse(RR,0.69;95%CI,0.52-0.91),statinuse(RR,0.18;
95% CI, 0.04-0.71), and educational attainment (RR, 0.53; 95%
CI, 0.30-0.93) were associated with the age- and sex-
adjusted risk for AMD; multivitamin use (RR, 0.74; 95% CI,
0.55-0.98) and educational level (RR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.46-
0.87) remained significant independent predictive factors in
a multivariable model.
As shown in Figure 1, the age- and sex-adjusted inci-
dence of AMD also varied by generation or birth cohort. The

 in the Greatest Generation, 3.0% in the Silent Generation, 1.0%
in the Baby Boom generation, and 0.3% in Generation X. Ad-
justing for age and sex, each generation was more than 65%
less likely to develop AMD than the previous generation (RR,
0.34; 95% CI, 0.24-0.46) (Table 3). Age- and generation-
specific 5-year incidences are shown in the eTable in the
Supplement.
To determine whether potential AMD risk factors medi-
ate this generational trend, we constructed a multivariable
model adjusting for age, sex, smoking, educational attain-
ment, exercise, levels of non-HDL cholesterol and hsCRP, and
use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, statins, and mul-
tivitamins. The generational effect remained statistically sig-
nificant but was slightly attenuated (RR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.28-
0.58) (Table 3). In addition to generation, only age remained
as a significant independent risk factor for AMD. Adjusting for
familyclustersdidnotaltertheseresults.Amultivariablemodel
using indicator variables for generation showed similar re-
sults for each generation. There were no cases of late AMD in
the Baby Boom or Generation X cohorts; therefore, analyses
of late-stage disease were not possible.
Figure 2 gives the estimated incidence of AMD by genera-
tion and age from the multivariable model. When comparing
across generations at a specific age, the incidence of AMD was
lower among the Baby Boom generation than in the Silent Gen-
eration, which had a lower incidence than the Greatest Gen-
eration. Generation X is young, but even at this early phase,
the estimated incidence appeared to follow this trend, and was
lower than the incidence among young Baby Boomers.
Discussion
The 5-year incidence of AMD was 60% lower for each suc-
cessive generation. Therefore, people born during the Baby
Boom years were 60% less likely to develop AMD than those
from the Silent Generation, who were 60% less likely to
develop AMD than those from the Greatest Generation. This
dramatic decline in the incidence across 3 generations sug-
gests that environmental and/or behavioral factors are
important risk factors in the etiology of AMD, because rapid
genetic changes are unlikely.8 Our results are consistent with

 the previously reported decline in risk for participants born
before 1943.10 This study extends the findings to people
born during the Baby Boom and represents the largest
cohort of aging adults to date. Although adults in Generation
X are just beginning to enter the risk years for AMD, they
also appear to be experiencing a decline in the risk for AMD,
but additional follow-up is needed to determine whether
this pattern continues when they become older adults. This
pattern is consistent with a recent report of declining preva-
lence of AMD in European countries.24
In this study, smoking, a well-recognized risk factor for
AMD,25 was not associated with the 5-year risk, which is con-
sistent with results from the 5-year follow-up of the BDES26
and Blue Mountains Eye Study.27 A decline in smoking expo-
sure in recent decades and the short follow-up may have lim-
ited our ability to detect an association. The effect of genera-
tion was slightly attenuated but remained statistically
significant in the model controlling for potential AMD risk fac-
tors,suchassmoking,markersofinflammation,non-HDLcho-
lesterol level, educational attainment, medication use, and
multivitamin use. These results suggest that other yet-to-be
identified modifiable factors may be important contributors
to the risk for AMD.
The decline in AMD is consistent with reports of declines
in the incidence of cardiovascular disease and dementia
observed in the same time period and with improvements in
longevity.1,3-7 These diseases involve vascular and inflamma-
tory pathways, consistent with the pathways hypothesized
to be important in the development of AMD. We did not have
a baseline measure of atherosclerosis in the BDES cohort;
thus, we were unable to directly control for atherosclerosis.
Controlling for inflammation did not explain the generation
effect, perhaps because short-term exposure to higher levels
of inflammation, as captured by the single measure of hsCRP
or IL-6 level, may be insufficient to cause damage leading
to AMD.
The reasons for the dramatic decline in cardiovascular dis-
ease risk, recognized as early as the 1970s, and the more re-
cently recognized decline in dementia risk remain unknown,
suggesting that we may never know the reasons for this de-
cline in AMD risk.28 These generalized improvements in health
may be attributed to broad changes in the environment, such
ascleanerairandwaterandimprovementsinsanitation,which
have reduced exposures to neurotoxins, particulates, and in-
fectious agents that may contribute to chronic diseases of
aging.12 Alternatively, with the advent of antibiotics and vac-
cines, each generation experienced fewer serious infectious
diseases of childhood, and the diseases may have been more
likely to be milder or of shorter duration.13 Infectious dis-
eases may have long-term sequelae by increasing the risk for
chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, although the
exact mechanisms are uncertain.29 Social stress, another risk
factor for chronic diseases of aging,30 has also differed across
generations, because historic events have exposed each gen-
erationtodramaticallydifferentlivingconditions,worries,and
challenges. The Greatest Generation lived through numerous
wars,theGreatDepression,andfoodrationing,whichmayhave
had adverse long-term effects on health, including ocular
health. Many age-related conditions may have their origins in

 childhood or in utero exposures31; thus, improvements in ma-
ternalhealthandchildhoodnutritionandhealthcaremayhave
contributed to the observed decline.
Aging Baby Boomers may be less likely to develop AMD
than previous generations if this trend continues as they age
into the primary risk years. Thus, projections about future
eye health care needs related to AMD may have overesti-
mated the public health burden.2 The number of older adults
in the United States is expected to increase as the Baby Boom
cohort ages,32 but AMD may be associated with increased
mortality,33 and indications suggest that previous gains in life
expectancy may not continue,34 making it difficult to accu-
rately estimate the future number of people who will need
medical care for AMD by midcentury. The implications for
research include the need for novel hypotheses to identify
new ways to reduce the risk for AMD among tomorrow’
s
elders and to determine whether the primary risk factors for
AMD vary by generation because of changes in the preva-
lence of exposures (ie, if the prevalence of a known risk fac-
tor declines substantially, another factor may emerge as
important). Because the incidence of AMD is low among the
Baby Boom generation, large studies will be needed to have
adequate power to investigate etiologic risk factors. Com-
bined with improvements in treatments, this rapid and dra-
matic decline in 5-year incidence suggests that the Baby Boom
generation may avoid the loss of vision due to AMD that has
been a major source of disability for prior generations.
Strengths and Limitations
The strengths of the study are the population-based design,
the high retention rates in both cohorts, the objective assess-
ments of AMD, and measurement of numerous potential con-
founders. The offspring design of the BOSS reduces the ge-
netic heterogeneity that would be present in unrelated cohorts
and increases the probability that any change is attributable
to differences in modifiable exposures.
This study is limited by the inability to disentangle birth
cohort from period effects. Our approach recognizes this im-
possibility and assesses the joint effect of risk in people born
in different time periods and living through different periods
at different ages. When planning for future clinical needs, it
is important to know the risk for people entering the major risk
period, rather than rely on data generated from the current or
past elderly populations.
Although these cohorts predominately consisted of
non-Hispanic white individuals, with results that may not be
generalizable to other racial/ethnic groups, non-Hispanic
white individuals are known to have a higher risk for AMD
than African American, Hispanic, and Chinese American
individuals.35 Whether other racial/ethnic groups have expe-
rienced the same declining risk across generations or
whether the risk has increased needs to be determined. The
risk among non-Hispanic white individuals may differ by
geographic region36; thus, studies of this population living in
other regions in the United States are needed (the BDES
cohort lived in a single midwestern city during 1987 to 1988).
The offspring were not geographically constrained (they
could have become adults before their parents moved to
Beaver Dam), although most lived in Wisconsin at the time
of the baseline examination during 2005 to 2008. Geo-
graphic differences also may reflect variation in environ-
mental exposures.
Some of the decline in risk among the BOSS participants
may reflect changes in the imaging methods between the 2
studies. The BDES used film-based systems, whereas the BOSS
examinations used digital imaging. However, previous work
has demonstrated that comparable results are obtained with
both systems,20 the grading for both studies was performed
by the same center, and the decline began in the generations
included in the BDES, lessening the likelihood that this pat-
tern was caused by measurement differences.
Conclusions
We demonstrated that the 5-year risk of developing AMD was
dramatically lower for generations born later in the 20th cen-
tury than those born earlier. We have extended these find-
ings to the large group of Baby Boomers currently entering the
ages at which AMD is detected. Although we were unable to
identify the factors that explained the change, this study sug-
gests that modifiable factors contribute to the etiology of AMD.
These results suggest that the current epidemic of AMD among
the current older population may wane over time and that fu-
ture research may uncover opportunities for primary preven-
tion of this vision-threatening disorder. Prospective epide-
miologic studies are needed to confirm these findings in other
populations.
