Abstract
The relationship among diet, human health, and disease is an area of growing interest in biomarker research.
Previous studies suggest that the consumption of cranberries (Vaccinium macrocarpon) could beneficially
influence urinary and digestive health. The present study sought to determine if daily consumption of sweetened
dried cranberries (SDC) changes the urinary proteome and fecal microbiome, as determined in a prospective
sample of 10 healthy individuals. Baseline urine and fecal samples were collected from the subjects in the fasted
(8–12 h) state. The subjects then consumed one serving (42 g) of SDC daily with lunch for 2 weeks. Urine and
fecal samples were collected again the day after 2 weeks of SDC consumption. Orbitrap Q-Exactive mass
spectrometry of urinary proteins showed that consumption of SDC resulted in changes to 22 urinary proteins.
Multiplex sequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA genes in fecal samples indicated changes in relative abundance of
several bacterial taxonomic units after consumption of SDC. There was a shift in the Firmicutes:Bacteroidetes
ratio, increases in commensal bacteria, and decreases or the absence of bacteria associated with negative health
effects. A decrease in uromodulin in all subjects and an increase in Akkermansia bacteria in most subjects were
observed and warrant further investigation. Future larger clinical studies with multiomics and multitissue
sampling designs are required to determine the effects of SDC consumption on nutrition and health.

Introduction
I
ntegrated studies of proteome and microbiome in
response to diet are of importance to move omics data to
tangible clinical applications. Previously, cranberry polyphe-
nol chemistry has been related to health outcomes (Burleigh
et al., 2013; Feliciano et al., 2015; Krueger et al., 2013a; Pierre
et al., 2013, 2014). In light of these past studies and the in-
crease in consumption of sweetened dried cranberries (SDC),
we determined if the consumption of SDC by healthy human
subjects results in detectable changes to the urinary proteome
and the fecal microbiome.
Cranberries contain proanthocyanidins (PACs) which im-
prove gut barrier function in mouse models (Anhe et al.,
2015; Pierre et al., 2013, 2014). Therefore, discovery and
identification of signature shifts in endogenous urinary pro-
teins or the fecal microbiome could inform the development
of new biomarkers of gut barrier function. Urine and feces, in
particular, have value as diagnostic specimens for tracking
dietary interventions for health outcomes because collection
is noninvasive. In typical human urine, the excretion of
proteins is relatively low, but the sample volume can be large.
Urine fluctuates in response to stimulants and contains po-
tential biomarkers (Chen and Kim, 2016; Thomas et al.,
2016). Diet may reversibly alter the human fecal microbiome
at the species and genera level, although the microbiome is
stable at the phylum level in long-term studies (Martinez
et al., 2013).

 The aims of this prospective study were to determine if
daily consumption of SDC alters the urinary proteome and
fecal microbiome in 2 weeks and evaluate if these changes
might be related to urinary and digestive health.
Materials and Methods
Sweetened dried cranberries
SDC were a blend from two commercial sources (Ocean
Spray Cranberries and Mariani) mixed at a 1:1 (w/w) ratio.
The blended SDC were repackaged into 42 g individual
servings (USDA, 2016) in a food grade processing facility.
SDC composition is provided in Table 1 (USDA, 2016). The
4-(dimethylamino)cinnamaldehyde (DMAC) assay was used
to quantify PAC content (Feliciano et al., 2012).
Clinical study design
Healthy human subjects (n = 10, 2 men and 8 women) be-
tween the ages of 20 and 41 (mean = 27.5 years –9.95 standard
deviation [SD]) with a body mass index of 20.5–28.7 (mean=
24.07 years –2.31SD) were recruited and screened. Volunteers
with a medical history of immune-compromising diseases, uri-
nary tract infection (UTI) within the past 6 months, chronic
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), digestive diseases, diabetes,
or cranberry allergy were excluded. Subjects who already reg-
ularly consumed cranberry products were excluded. Volunteers
disclosed prescription and over-the-counter medications, as
well as supplements, and these were taken into consideration
when we selected the study subjects. One subject maintained
a vegetarian diet during the trial period. None of the subjects
had notable dietary changes during the trial.
Those selected were enrolled under a protocol approved by
the University of Wisconsin Health Sciences Institutional
Review Board (IRB 2015-0317). A written and informed
consent was obtained from all subjects.
Subjects were directed to complete a daily diet journal for
7 days before the baseline samples. Subjects continued to
record dietary intake (including time of consumption) during
the 2-week intervention period. Exercise or other daily ac-
tivity was not recorded.
Baseline urine and fecal samples were collected from the
subjects in the fasted (8–12 h) state. The subjects then con-
sumed one serving (42 g) of SDC daily with lunch for 2
weeks. Urine and fecal samples were collected again the day
after the 2-week SDC consumption period, as was done
previously. A total of 10 paired pre- and post-consumption
samples were collected in the present study. Samples were
kept in a cooler with frozen gel packs from the time of col-
lection until the time of submission to the laboratory. Urine
samples were immediately frozen at -80�C from the time of
submission (July and August 2015) until they were defrosted
and aliquoted (4–5 mL) for analysis (December 2015). Fecal
samples were immediately aliquoted (150 mg) and frozen at
-80�C from the time of submission (July and August 2015)
until they were defrosted for analysis (December 2015).
Analysis of urinary proteome
Preparation and proteome analysis of the urine samples were
done by the UW School of Pharmacy Analytical Instrumenta-
tion Center Mass Spectrometry Facility (Fig. 1A). Using a
label-free approach (Jerebtsova and Nekhai, 2014), we used
mass spectrometry for characterization of the urinary proteome.
The Orbitrap Q-Exactive Mass Spectrometry system combines
quadrupole precursor ion selection with high-resolution accu-
rate mass Orbitrap detection to deliver very high resolving
power (up to 140,000 full width at half-maximum) to identify,
quantify, and confirm compounds in complex samples, which
facilitates proteomics, metabolomics, lipidomics, and metabo-
lomics through detection of low-abundance components in
complex samples (Michalski et al., 2011).
Each subject had a pre- and post-treatment urine sample, and
a technical replicate for each sample was run through the Or-
bitrap Q-Exactive mass spectrometer. All centrifuge steps were
spun at 4�C, 20,000 g. Four microliters urine of each sample was
concentrated to 500 lL using Amicon Ultra 3kda molecular
weight (MW) spin filters pre-wet with optima liquid chroma-
tograph mass spectrometry (LC-MS) grade water. Samples
were buffer exchanged with 3x volume of 50 mM ammonia
bicarbonate before protein quantification and digestion. Micro
BCA of all 20 samples (pre- and post-) was performed. Urinary
proteins were normalized with total ion current. Twenty mi-
crograms protein (determined by Micro BCA) of each sample
was digested as per standard digestion protocol.
Digested proteins were cleaned on C18 Zip Tips as per
manufacturer’s protocol. One microgram of each sample was
injected in duplicate on a 115 min increasing acetonitrile
(ACN) gradient. Pre- and post-Enolase QC runs to assess
mass spec performance were performed, and a 60 min blank
run between injections to clean the column and prevent car-
ryover was undertaken. Resulting raw files were searched

 thrice each (one full tryptic with modifications, one full
tryptic without modifications, and one semitryptic without
modifications) using Proteome Discoverer 1.4.1.14, SE-
QUEST HT (Thermo Fisher) against the human UniProt
database, including a decoy.
ChromAlign and peptide quantification was performed
using SIEVE 2.2 (Thermo Fisher). SIEVE data output in-
cludes protein identification for each subject, including the
number of peptides, frames, hits, and the pre/post protein
ratio calculation. Since our method used a label-free tech-
nique, results are relative. Further analysis was conducted
with the data from the semitryptic approach using proteins
composed of two or more peptides.
For proteins found to be significantly different, we con-
ducted a batch analysis of gene annotation information
through PANTHER version 10: expanded protein families
and functions and analysis tools (Mi et al., 2016) and the
PANTHER Classification system (Mi et al., 2013).
Analysis of fecal microbiome
The fecal microbiome analysis was performed by the
University of Wisconsin-Madison Biotechnology Center
(Fig. 1B). DNA was isolated from 0.15 g of fecal matter using
the OMNIgene adapted MO BIO PowerFecal DNA Isolation
Kit (Mo Bio Laboratories, Inc., Carlsbad, CA, USA). DNA
concentration was verified using the Qubit� dsDNA HS
Assay Kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Samples
were prepared as described in the 16S Metagenomic Se-
quencing Library Preparation Protocol, Part No. 15044223
Rev. B (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) with the fol-
lowing modifications: The 16S ribosomal RNA gene V3/V4
variable region was amplified with nested primers:
forward primer: 5¢-ACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGC
TCTTCCGATCTCCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG-3¢
reverse primer: 5¢-TGACTGGAGTTCAGACGTGTGCT
CTTCCGATCTGACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC-3¢
Region specific primers were previously described in
Klindworth et al., 2013, and were modified to add Illumina
adapter overhang nucleotide sequences to the gene-specific
sequences. Following initial amplification, library size was
verified on an Agilent DNA1000 chip and cleaned using a 1x
volume of AxyPrep Mag PCR clean-up beads (Axygen Bios-
ciences, Union City, CA, USA). Illumina dual indexes and
sequencing adapters were added using the following primers:

Bracketed sequences are equivalent to the Illumina Dual
Index adapters D501–D508 and D701–D712. Following
PCR, samples were cleaned using a 1x volume of AxyPrep
Mag PCR clean-up beads (Axygen Biosciences). Quality and
quantity of the finished libraries were assessed using an
Agilent DNA1000 chip and Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit,
respectively. Libraries were standardized to 2 lM and pooled
before sequencing. Paired-end 250 bp sequencing was per-
formed using the Illumina MiSeq Sequencer and a MiSeq
600 bp (v3) sequencing cartridge. A technical replicate was
run for each sample.
Raw data were analyzed using the standard Illumina Pi-
peline, version 1.8.2. OTU assignments and diversity plots
were created using QIIME analysis pipeline (Caporaso et al.,
2010). Additional analysis was done using the program
MOTHUR (Schloss et al., 2009).
Statistical analysis
We used a two-tailed binomial test with a p-value of 0.05
to determine if the number of individuals with common
proteins or bacteria changing in the same direction was sig-
nificant. Because there were only 10 subjects, we considered
results with a p-value between 0.05 and 0.10 as trending
toward significance with a view to potential leads to inform
future hypothesis-driven studies with more subjects.
Results
Sweetened dried cranberries
We tested the SDC for composition. By the DMAC assay,
we found 0.62 mg/g (A2 equivalents) of soluble PAC and
2.22 mg/g of cranberry PAC (cPAC) equivalents in the SDC
product.
Urinary proteome
Technical replicate injections had a 71% overlap at the
protein level and 68% overlap at the peptide level, which are
in line with published results (Addona et al., 2009). We de-
tected 767 proteins with two or more peptides (Supplemen-
tary Table S1). To the best of our knowledge, 464 of the 767
proteins have not been previously described in the human
urinary proteome (Adachi et al., 2006; Li et al., 2010; Mar-
imuthu et al., 2011; Santucci et al., 2015; Zerefos et al., 2012;
Fig. 2). The unique proteins we identified in this study are
listed in Supplementary Table S2. Individual variation in
both the number of proteins identified and the composition of
the proteome was high. Although 64 proteins were found in at

 least 80% of our subjects, a high percentage of proteins were
only identified in individual subjects (420/767, 54.76%).
Twenty-two proteins were found to significantly change
( p < 0.05) between the pre- and postsamples (Table 2). Col-
lectively, they belong to the gene ontology (GO) biological
process categories of platelet degranulation (53.96-fold en-
richment, p = 9.75 · 10-6) and single multicellular organism
process (3.13-fold enrichment, p = 6.41 · 10-4). Seven of
these proteins are mapped to GO pathways (Table 3).
Of the 25 proteins found in all subjects (Table 4), three
proteins, namely the vesicular integral membrane protein,
phosphoinositide 3-kinase interacting protein 1, and ur-
omodulin, were observed to significantly decrease in all
subjects after the consumption of SDC ( p = 0.000977).
Eleven proteins were observed to decrease in 9 of 10 subjects
( p=0.010742) after SDC consumption: serum albumin, clus-
terin, collagen alpha 1 (XV) chain, pro-epidermal growth factor,
insulin-like growth factor binding protein, Ig kappa chain C
region, plasma serine protease inhibitor, kininogen 1, lysosomal
alpha glucosidase, osteopontin, and basement membrane spe-
cific heparan sulfate proteoglycan core protein. Fibrillin-1 in-
creased in 8/9 subjects (p=0.019531) after SDC consumption.
Cadherin 13 and vitelline membrane outer layer protein 1 ho-
molog were found to decrease after SDC consumption in the 8
subjects in which it was detected (p=0.003906).
Fecal microbiome
A principal coordinate analysis plot of beta-diversity is
shown in Figure 3. The pre- versus post-treatment samples did
not group together. When we compared the microbial phyla
present in the initial samples versus the final samples, the dif-
ferences were not significant. Six of 10 subjects increased the
representation of Bacteroidetes and 7 of 10 subjects decreased
the representation of Firmicutes in the total bacteria present.
Taken together, 7 of 10 subjects had a decreased Firmicu-
tes:Bacteroidetes ratio. Although not significant, 7 of 10 sub-
jects had increased species diversity in the post sample, and one
subject had no change in the total number of species present.
Therefore, 8 of 10 subjects had increased or unchanged species
diversity, approaching statistical significance ( p = 0.0546875).
Nine subjects had measurable levels of Akkermansia, and 7
of 9 had a higher relative abundance of Akkermansia in the
total bacterial population in the postsample, with a p-value of
0.08984375, trending toward significance (Fig. 4). Akker-
mansia was not detected in the fecal microbiome of one
subject, while another subject had a relatively large decrease.
In contrast, five subjects had greater than a one log increase in
relative abundance of Akkermansia.

CRANBERRY EFFECTS ON PROTEOME AND MICROBIOME

 including those with food and nutrient intake. In this context,
urinary proteomics has been noted as an emergent field of
omics science and diagnostic medicine over the past decade
(Adachi et al., 2006). Seminal articles in this field (Adachi et al.,
2006; Li et al., 2010; Marimuthu et al., 2011; Santucci et al.,
2015; Zerefos et al., 2012) have described roughly 4100 urinary
proteins.
In the present study, we sought to prospectively determine
whether the effects of daily consumption of SDC would lead
to changes in the urinary proteome and fecal microbiome in
10 subjects in 2 weeks. Based on our own research (Krueger
et al., 2013b) and of others (Liu et al., 2012; Nagaraj and
Mann, 2011), we anticipated that the present sample size
would offer new insights on proteome and microbiome
changes in response to cranberry consumption. We observed
767 proteins in 10 subjects. To the best of our knowledge, 464
of those proteins have not been previously described in the
human urinary proteome.
In contrast to a previous report (Nagaraj and Mann, 2011),
we did not find a large list of proteins common to all subjects.
We observed that 420 of 767 identified proteins were unique
to a single subject.
Interestingly, of the 25 proteins found to be common in all 10
subjects in this study, LMAN2 was not previously reported in
the publications described above. LMAN2 binds the sugar res-
idues of glycoproteins and the sugar chain in bacteria (Shirakabe
et al., 2011) and is involved in protein sorting and segregation
(Fiedler et al., 1994). Two proteins, IC1 and LAIR1, found in
9 of 10 subjects, were also not a part of the common core lists.
Complement inhibitor 1 is part of the classical primary com-
plement pathway, and defects can result in a primary immune
deficiency illness (Grumach and Kirschfink, 2014). Supple-
mentation of complement inhibitor 1 slows the clotting process,
binds gram-negative bacteria, and has anti-inflammatory effects
(Landsem et al., 2016). LAIR1 is expressed on hematopoietic
cells and carries immunoreceptor motifs on its tail (Cao et al.,
2015). LAIR1 is considered an immunoinhibitory collagen re-
ceptor, and defects in LAIR1 can result in autoimmune disor-
ders, viral illnesses, and cancer (Sun et al., 2014).
Taken together, our report of 464 urinary proteins that have
not been previously reported in the literature and the addition

 of the proteins above to the common core of proteins indicate
that there is still much to learn about the urinary proteome.
Compared to a previous study using a dietary supplement
consisting of cranberry powder (Krueger et al., 2013b), only
one of the eight previously reported proteins was detected in
the current study [Ig kappa chain V_III region CLL
(P04207)]. In the current study, it was neither found to be
common to all subjects nor was it found to be significantly
different in the subjects in which it was found. The reasons
for these findings are unclear. The previous study was shorter
(6 days), and cranberry powder was administered, rather than
SDC. Alternatively, with the small sample size of that study
(n = 10) and our study (n = 10), the discrepancy may be at-
tributable to individual differences.
Uromodulin is the most abundant urinary protein pro-
duced in the kidney and is associated with an increase in
innate immune responses in the kidney (Rampoldi et al.,
2011). Mouse studies suggest that uromodulin may provide
protection to the bladder in a UTI by binding with bacteria
(Rampoldi et al., 2011). Uromodulin is also a damage as-
sociated molecular pattern that is associated with kidney
injury (Anders and Schaefer, 2014) and stimulation of a pro-
inflammatory response in the urinary tract (Darisipudi et al.,
2012; Garimella and Sarnak, 2017; Rampoldi et al., 2011).
Therefore, the function of uromodulin in the urinary tract
remains unclear. Our subjects were prescreened for UTIs
before beginning the trial. Since we assume that the subjects
maintained a healthy urinary tract system throughout the
trial, a decrease in all subjects is an important observation
regarding the relationship between uromodulin and urinary
tract health. The effect of SDC consumption on uromodulin
requires more research.
Although it is not clear if microbial dysbiosis is the cause
or effect of disease (Round and Mazmanian, 2009), charac-
terization of the microbial community can highlight such
dysbiosis. Bacterial diversity is decreased in microbial dys-
biosis (Kim et al., 2016; Zhernakova et al., 2016). Seven of
our subjects had a richer microbiota after the intervention,
and one had no change. The trend we observed may suggest
that SDC favor species richness in the gut, perhaps because
SDC contain a diversity of microbial substrates such as fiber
and polyphenols (Blumberg et al., 2016).
Another measure commonly addressed in discussions of
digestive health is the Firmicutes:Bacteroidetes ratio (Ley
et al., 2006; Mariat et al., 2009). A reduction in the ratio could
indicate an increase in Bacteroidetes, a decrease in Firmi-
cutes, or both. Firmicutes are associated with increased en-
ergy efficiency and absorption, a condition that could cause
obesity. Seven of our subjects lowered their Firmicu-
tes:Bacteroidetes ratio in the trial. Specifically, 6/10 subjects
increased Bacteroidetes and 7/10 subjects decreased Firmi-
cutes. An interesting anomaly occurred with the subject who
maintained a vegetarian diet during the trial—the ratio in-
creased. In that subject, Prevotella (a Bacteroidetes) was the
largest contributor to the microbiome in the pretrial sample,
and Ruminococcus (a Firmicutes) was the largest contributor
to the microbiome in the post-intervention sample.
Falony et al. (2016) included only the genus Bifidobacter-
ium of the phylum Actinobacteria as part of the global core
bacteria. We found both the genera Bifidobacterium and Eg-
gerthella in all our samples. Actinobacteria produce bioactive
metabolites, including antibacterials, antifungals, antivirals,
and immunomodifiers. Although it was not significant, we
found an increased representation in the total bacterial com-
munity in both genera. Based on the functions of the phylum,
SDC may be stimulating immune function in the gut.
Our previous work (Pierre et al., 2013) demonstrated that
when cPACs are added to enteral nutrition in mice, mucin
production in the gut increases. Akkermansia are mucin de-
grading bacteria. Increased mucin production could support
an increased population of Akkermansia. The presence of
Akkermansia mediates symptoms associated with metabolic
syndrome (Anhe et al., 2015, 2016; Li et al., 2016; Roopc-
hand et al., 2015; Schneeberger et al., 2015). Of our 10
subjects, 9 subjects had detectable levels of Akkermansia in
both the pretrial state and post-intervention. Of those, seven
had an increased relative abundance of Akkermansia in the
total bacterial composition.
Conclusions
The addition of SDC to the diet of 10 subjects daily for 2
weeks influenced the composition of the urinary proteome
and fecal microbiome. Twenty-two proteins were found to
have differences between pre- and post-treatment, including
uromodulin. With the function of uromodulin in the urinary
system unclear, but understood to be implicated in urinary
health, the decrease found in all subjects was intriguing.
Utilizing a labeled isotope approach to target and quantify
uromodulin in relation to SDC will be a focus in upcoming
studies. The present study also added to the number of pro-
teins found in healthy human urine by about 10%. Targeting
the genera of interest, including Akkermansia to obtain more
quantitative results, is also warranted in the future.
