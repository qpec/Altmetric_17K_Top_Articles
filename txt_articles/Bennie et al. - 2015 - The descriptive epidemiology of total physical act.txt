Abstract
Background: The current Australia's Physical Activity and Sedentary Behaviour Guidelines recommend that adults
engage in regular moderate-to-vigorous-intensity physical activity (MVPA) and strength training (ST), and minimise
time spent in sedentary behaviours (SB). However, evidence about the specific individual and concurrent distribution
of these behaviours in Australia is scarce. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and
sociodemographic correlates of MVPA, ST and SB in a national-representative sample of Australian adults.
Methods: Data were collected using face-to-face interviews, as part of the National Nutrition and Physical Activity
Survey 2011–12. The population-weighted proportions meeting the MVPA (≥150 min/week), ST (≥2 sessions/week) and
combined MVPA-ST guidelines, and proportions classified as having ‘low levels of SB’ (<480 min/day) were calculated,
and their associations with selected sociodemographic and health-related variables were assessed using
multiple logistic regression analyses. This was also done for those at potentially ‘high-risk’, defined as insufficient
MVPA-ST and ‘high-sedentary’ behaviour.
Results: Out of 9345 participants (response rate = 77.0 %), aged 18–85 years, 52.6 % (95 % CI: 51.2 %–54.0 %),
18.6 % (95 % CI: 17.5 %–19.7 %) and 15.0 % (95 % CI: 13.9 %–16.1 %) met the MVPA, ST and combined
MVPA-ST guidelines, respectively. Female gender, older age, low/medium education, poorer self-rated health,
being classified as underweight or obese, and being a current smoker were independently associated with lower odds
of meeting the MVPA, ST and combined MVPA-ST guidelines. A total of 78.9 % (95 % CI: 77.9 %–80.0 %) were classified
as having low levels of SB. Females, older adults and those with lower education were more likely to report lower
levels of SB, whilst those with poor self-rated health and obese individuals were less likely to report lower levels of SB
(i.e. SB = ≥480 min/day). A total of 8.9 % (95 % CI: 8.1 %–9.6 %) were categorised as individuals at potentially ‘high-risk’.
Those with poorer self-rated health, obese individuals, those aged 25–44, and current smokers were more likely to be
in the ‘high risk’ group.

Conclusions: The large majority of Australian adults do not meet the full physical activity guidelines and/or report
excessive SB. Our results call for public health interventions to reduce physical inactivity and SB in Australia, particularly
among the subgroups at the highest risk of these unhealthy behaviours.
Keywords: Public health surveillance, Strength training, Physical activity, Sitting
Background
Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are responsible for
68 % of all deaths worldwide [1]. Physical inactivity is
among the leading preventable causes of NCDs [2]. It is
estimated to cause 6–10 % of deaths related to coronary
heart disease, diabetes, and breast and colon cancer [3].
It is the fourth ranked mortality risk factor; after hyperten-
sion, tobacco use and high blood glucose [3, 4], and it
causes 9 % of premature mortality [3]. Estimates based on
self-report data suggest that globally 40 %–60 % of adults
are insufficiently active for health [5]. Consequently, redu-
cing rates of physical inactivity has been described as a
key 21st century public health challenge [2, 6, 7].
Until recently, physical activity recommendations were
primarily based around the accumulation of moderate-
to-vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity (MVPA)
(e.g. walking or jogging) [8, 9]. However, evidence from
epidemiological studies and controlled trials suggests
that regular participation in muscle-strengthening activ-
ities (e.g. weight or resistance training) may provide add-
itional benefits for musculoskeletal (e.g. reducing the
risk of sarcopenia, osteoporosis and osteoarthritis) [10],
metabolic (e.g. reducing the risk of metabolic syndrome
and type 2 diabetes) [11, 12] and mental health (e.g.
reducing the symptoms of anxiety) [10]. Moreover,
recent studies have shown that, when compared to one
activity mode alone, there may be greater metabolic health
benefits of combining MVPA and muscle-strengthening
activities [12–15].
In addition, sedentary behaviour (excessive sitting as
opposed to insufficient physical activity) has recently
emerged as a potential independent risk factor for poor
health [16]. Prospective studies have shown that adults
who accrue high volumes of sedentary behaviour are at a
higher risk of developing chronic diseases such as type 2
diabetes [17–19] and cardiovascular disease [20], as well as
at a higher risk of all-cause and disease-specific mortality
[21–25]. Importantly, the association between prolonged
sitting and detrimental health outcomes remains significant
even after adjustment for time spent in MVPA [16, 26–28],
indicating that, for optimal health benefits, people should
both be active and limit their time spent in sedentary
behaviour.
For the prevention and management of chronic diseases,
leading global and national health authorities, such as the
World Health Organization (WHO), the U.S. Department
of Health and Human Services and the Australian
Government, Department of Health, recommend that
adults should participate in: (i) at least 150 min/week of
moderate (e.g. brisk walking) or 75 min/week of vigorous-
intensity physical activity (e.g. jogging), or an equivalent
combination of both, and (ii) 2 or more days per week of
muscle-strengthening activities involving major muscle
groups
[7,
29–31].
Additionally,
authorities
within
Australia and the U.S. recommend that adults limit time
spent in sedentary behaviours [29, 30]. At present there is
no consensus on the threshold relationship between
sedentary behaviour and poor health [16]. Hence, current
sedentary behaviour reduction guidelines typically state
that adults should ‘limit prolonged periods of time spent
in sedentary behaviours’
, and ‘frequently break up long
periods of sitting’ [29, 30, 32].
Previous population-based studies have mostly focused
on assessing the prevalence and correlates of MVPA
[33–35]. Only few studies examined the proportion of
people meeting the recommendations for strength training
in national-representative samples.
Estimations range from 21.9 to 31.7 % within the U.S
and UK [36–40] and from 9.4 to 15.5 % in Australia
[41–43]. Data about meeting the combined MVPA-
muscle-strengthening guidelines are even scarcer. Previous
studies have shown that 18.2 to 20.6 % of U.S. adults meet
both MVPA and strength training guidelines [36, 44, 45],
but no such estimates exist for the Australian population.
Furthermore, international studies have reported that
adults from different countries sit on average between 135
and 360 min/day, whilst the prevalence rates of total
sitting time above 9 h/day ranged between 2.6 and
34.9 % [46, 47]. No previous international or national
studies have concurrently assessed the prevalence and
correlates of MVPA, muscle-strengthening activities
and sedentary behaviours, and clusters of these behaviours
in a representative sample. Such data are essential to
inform comprehensive interventions aimed to reduce
physical inactivity and prolonged sitting, and to identify
populations at the highest risk.
The aim of this study was, therefore, to determine the
prevalence of adherence to the public health MVPA and
muscle-strengthening activity guidelines, and high level
of sedentarism among a population-representative sample
of Australian adults and to investigate their sociodemo-
graphic and health-related correlates.

 Methods
This study accessed the data from the Australian Bureau
of Statistics (ABS), National Nutrition and Physical
Activity Survey (NNPAS) 2011–12. The NNPAS is a
sub-component of the larger ABS Australian Health Survey
(AHS), 2011–13, which is a national survey designed to
provide detailed information on the health and wellbeing of
the Australian population. Data from the NNPAS 2011–12
are are publicly accessible. The NNPAS 2011–12 was con-
ducted between May 2011 and June 2012, and used a strati-
fied multistage area sampling of private dwellings to ensure
recruitment of a representative sample of Australian adults.
Detailed information on the survey design, data collec-
tion, and response rates can be found elsewhere [48]. The
Australian Bureau of Statistics Research Ethics Committee
approved
all
study
protocols
and
written
informed
consent from all participants was obtained [48]. Upon
given consent, data were obtained by face-to-face inter-
views in respondents’ homes by trained interviewers using
Computer Assisted Personal Interview (CAPI) system.
The initial sample size (14,363 households) was re-
duced to 12,366 dwellings after sample loss in the field
stage. Of the remaining dwellings, 9519 (77.0 %) fully or
adequately responded to the first interview [48]. A total of
12,153 participants (aged 2–85 years) fully or adequately
completed the survey. For the present study, we used data
from adults aged 18–85 years, leaving a final sample of
9435 respondents. Each of the respondents was given a se-
lection probability weight, which is reflective of how many
people in the population they represent. More information
on weighting in the NNPAS can be found on the ABS
website [48].
Measures and data management
The questionnaire used in the NNPAS 2011–12 can be
found elsewhere [49]. For the present study, we used the
data on physical activity, strength/toning activities, seden-
tary behaviour and selected sociodemographic and health-
related variables.
Physical activity
Self-reported physical activity levels were assessed using
the Active Australia Survey which has been previously
validated among adults and older adults. The survey has
been shown to have adequate reliability for classifying
participants into insufficiently/sufficiently active groups
(Cohen’s kappa = 0.50–0.52) (ref), and adequate validity
when assessed against pedometer step counts (Spearman
rho = 0.42–0.43) [50] and against accelerometers (Spear-
man rho = 0.52) [51]. Respondents reported the number
of occasions (frequency) and estimated time spent
(duration)
in
walking
and
other
moderate-intensity
activity (e.g. gentle swimming, social tennis doubles,
golf), and vigorous physical activity (e.g. jogging, fast
cycling, circuit training, competitive tennis) over the past
week. It should be noted that these questions also covered
participation in any moderate- or
vigorous-intensity
muscle-strengthening activity. The data were scored using
established methods described in the guide for implemen-
tation of the Active Australia Survey [52]. The reported
durations for each activity were summed to estimate the
total time spent in MVPA. Based on the 2014 Australia’s
Physical Activity & Sedentary Behaviour Guidelines for
Adults [29], participants were dichotomised as either: (i)
‘meeting the MVPA guidelines’ (≥150 moderate-intensity
minutes/week or ≥75 vigorous-intensity minutes/week or
an equivalent combination of both), or (ii) ‘not meeting
the MVPA guidelines’.
Muscle-strengthening activities
To assess participation in muscle-strengthening activities,
respondents were asked, “Including any activities already
mentioned, in the last week did you do any strength or
toning activities?”. If they answered positively, they were
further asked: “How many times did you do any strength
or toning activities in the last week?”. It should be noted
that these questions covered the muscle-strengthening
activities that participants already mentioned in their
responses to questions about MVPA, and potentially any
other muscle-strengthening activities that are not of
moderate or vigorous intensity. Similar questions have
previously shown adequate reliability (Cohen’s kappa =
0.85–0.92) [53], and have been used in population studies
in Australia [41] and the US [38, 45]. For strength and
toning activities, data were missing for 1 participant. Ac-
cording to the Australian Physical Activity and Sedentary
Behaviour Guidelines [29] and consistent with previous
population studies [36, 38, 41, 43, 45], the sample was
dichotomised as either; (i) ‘meeting the strength training
guidelines’ (≥2 sessions/week), or (ii) ‘not meeting the
strength training guidelines’ (<2 sessions/week).
Meeting the combined MVPA-strength training guidelines
Consistent with previous studies [36, 45, 54], based on
the data about the participation in MVPA and muscle-
strengthening activities, the sample was dichotomised as
either (i) meeting the combined MVPA-strength training
guidelines (≥150 MVPA minutes/week and ≥2 sessions/
week of strength or toning activities) or (ii) not meet-
ing
the
MVPA-strength
training
guidelines
(<150
MVPA minutes/week or <2 sessions/week of muscle-
strengthening activities).
Sedentary behaviour
Respondents reported their time spent in sedentary behav-
iour during the last week within the following contexts: (i)
sitting at work (ii); sitting for transport (including waiting
for transport); (iii) sitting or lying down to watch
Bennie et al. BMC Public Health  (2016) 16:73 
Page 3 of 13
 television or videos; (iv) sitting or lying down to play elec-
tronic games; (v) sitting or lying down to use a computer
or the internet; (vi) sitting or lying down to use a phone
(including text messages and talking); and (vii) sitting or
lying down to do other social or leisure activities (such as
at a barbecue, for meals, at a cinema, etc.). Similar
questions have previously shown adequate reliability and
validity in adults [55, 56]. Times spent sitting in these
contexts were summed to calculate the total time spent in
sedentary behaviour during the last week, and then di-
vided by seven to report on minutes/day. Consistent with
previous population studies [46], the sitting data were
truncated at 960 min/day (16 h). A total of 45 out of 9435
cases (0.5 % of the total sample) were truncated for report-
ing sitting >960 min/day and 32 (0.3 % of the sample)
were missing data on sedentary behaviour altogether.
At present there is no official agreement around the
threshold at which sitting is considered detrimental for
health. However, a recent meta-analysis showed that
sitting for more than 8 h/day significantly increases the
risk of all-cause mortality [57]. While further research is
needed to validate this threshold, the potential for using
8 h/day as a measure of excessive engagement in seden-
tary behaviour was recently discussed by public health
experts in the development of Australian sedentary
behaviour guidelines [58, 59]. Therefore, in the present
study, we considered ≥8 h/day (≥480 min/day) as a
proxy measure of high engagement in sedentary behav-
iours, and classified participants as (i) ‘low-sedentary’
(<480 min/day) or (ii) ‘high-sedentary’ (≥480 min/day).
Participants at ‘high-risk’ - clustering of insufficient MVPA
and strength training and high levels of sedentary behaviour
Respondents were classified in the ‘high-risk’ group if they:
(i) did not meet the MVPA guidelines (<150 min/week),
and (ii) did not meet the strength training guidelines
(<2 sessions/week), and (iii) were in the ‘high-seden-
tary’ category (≥480 min/day).
Sociodemographic and lifestyle variables
Sociodemographic (sex, age, level of education) and
health related variables (self-rated health and smoking
status) were assessed during the interview using stand-
ard questions. Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated
based on objectively measured height and weight using
standard methods and categorised into: <18.5 kg/m2
(underweight); from ≥18.5 kg/m2 to <25 kg/m2 (normal/
acceptable weight range); from ≥25 kg/m2 to <30 kg/m2
(overweight); and ≥30 kg/m2 (obese). More detailed
description of the sociodemographic and health-related
data collected in NNPAS 2011–12 can be found else-
where [49].
Statistical analysis
Percentages and their 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CI)
were calculated for the following categories: (i) meeting
the MVPA guidelines; (ii) meeting the strength training
guidelines; (iii) meeting the combined MVPA-strength
training guidelines; (iv) ‘low-sedentary’ (<480 min/day);
and (v) ‘high-risk’ (not meeting the MVPA guidelines/not
meeting the strength training guidelines/‘high-sedentary’).
Chi-squared tests (either based on testing an overall asso-
ciation or trend depending on the variable) were used to
test the unadjusted differences between the prevalence
rates by selected sociodemographic (sex, age, level of
education) and health-related variables (self-rated health,
BMI, smoking status).
A series of multiple logistic regression analyses was
used to assess the associations between sociodemo-
graphic and health-related variables and: (i) meeting/not
meeting MVPA guidelines; (ii) meeting/not meeting the
strength training guidelines; (iii) meeting/not meeting
the combined MVPA-strength training guidelines; (iv)
being ‘low/high sedentary’; and (v) being/not being in
the ‘high-risk’ group (not meeting the MVPA guidelines/
not meeting the strength training guidelines/‘high-seden-
tary’). Each model included the following explanatory vari-
ables: sex (reference group [ref] = “male”); age (ref = “18–24
years”); education level (ref = “high”); self-reported general
health
status
(ref = “excellent”);
BMI
(ref = “normal
weight”);
and
smoking
status
(ref = “never
smoked”).
Adjusted odds ratios and their 95 % CIs were reported.
Statistical analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS
22.0 statistical software (SPSS Inc. an IBM Company,
Chicago, IL). For all statistical tests, a p-value of <0.05 was
used to indicate statistical significance. All estimates were
weighted using population weights provided by the ABS.
Strata were not identifiable in the data due to confidential-
ity concerns, so the effect of the sample design on the
accuracy of the estimates was accounted for by using the
delete-a-group Jackknife method to calculate the standard
error of the estimates. Replicate weights were provided by
the ABS. More detailed information can be found on the
ABS website [48].
Results
Data were available for 9435 adults aged 18–85 years
(response rate = 77.0 %). As shown in Table 1, when
compared to current Australian population estimates
[51], the proportions of the NNPAS 2011–12 sample
was largely concordant across most sociodemographic
variables. In the current study, a total of 54.1 % were
female, 45.9 % were aged 18–44 years, 25.7 % had high
education levels (degree or higher degree), 51.5 %
reported either ‘excellent’ or ‘very good’ self-rated health,
34.3 % had normal BMI status and 48.5 % reported
never smoking (Table 1).

 For the total sample, the median time spent in MVPA
was 150 min/week (95 % CI: 134–155, interquartile
range [IQR]: 365). The majority of participants reported
no
participation
in
muscle-strengthening
activities;
hence the median number of sessions per week was 0.
Among the 22.7 % of participants that did muscle-
strengthening activities, the mean number of sessions
per week was 3.66 (95 % CI: 3.34-23.86, SD = 3.01). The
median
time
spent
in
sedentary
behaviours
was
308 min/day (95 % CI: 305–314, IQR: 253).
As shown in Table 1, 52.6 % (95 % CI: 51.2 %–54.0 %)
of people met the MVPA guideline only, 18.6 % (95 %
CI: 17.5 %–19.7 %) met the strength training guideline
(ST) only and 15.0 % (95 % CI: 13.9 %–16.1 %) met both
guidelines (MVPA-ST) (Table 1). Unadjusted analyses
indicated significant differences between the proportions
of participants meeting these guidelines across all socio-
demographic and health-related variables (p < 0.001 for
almost all comparisons) (Table 1).
Accordingly, as shown in Table 2, in the adjusted ana-
lysis, all the selected sociodemographic and health-
related variables showed significant overall associations
with meeting/not meeting MVPA guideline, the strength
training guideline, and the combination of both guide-
lines (overall p < 0.05 for all explanatory variables). Spe-
cifically, females (OR = 0.76, 95 % CI: 0.61–0.93) were
less likely to meet the combined MVPA-ST guidelines
then males. When compared to adults aged 18–24 years,
all other age groups were less likely to meet the com-
bined MVPA-ST guidelines. The ORs ranged from 0.14

Compared
to
adults
reporting
‘excellent’
self-rated
health, all other groups were less likely to meet the com-
bined MVPA-ST guidelines. The ORs ranged from 0.26
(95 % CI: 0.11–0.61) for those reporting ‘poor’ health to
0.63 (95 % CI: 0.46–0.86) for those reporting ‘very good’
health. When compared to those with high education,
those with low (OR = 0.70, 95 % CI: 0.53–0.93) and
medium education (OR = 0.74, 95 % CI: 0.60–0.92) were
less likely to meet the combined MVPA-ST guidelines.
Compared to those with normal BMI (18.5–25 kg/m2),
those who were classified as obese (OR = 0.65, 95 % CI:
0.50–0.85) and underweight (OR = 0.31, 95 % CI: 0.14–
0.68) were less likely to meet the combined MVPA-ST
guidelines. Interestingly, when compared to those who
never smoked, ex-smokers were more likely (OR =1.47,
95 % CI: 1.20–1.80), whilst current smokers were less
likely (OR = 0.77, 95 % CI: 0.59–0.99) to meet the com-
bined MVPA-ST guidelines.
A total of 78.9 % (95 % CI: 77.9 %–80.0 %) were classified
as ‘low-sedentary’ (Table 1). In the adjusted analysis, overall
associations with sedentary behaviour categories were sig-
nificant for all the explanatory variables (overall p < 0.001
for all), except for smoking status (overall p = 0.49). Specif-
ically, when compared to the reference groups, females
(OR = 1.61, 95 % CI: 1.39–1.87), adults aged 65–74 years
(OR = 1.65, 95 % CI: 1.14–2.37) and ≥75 years (OR = 2.25,
95 % CI: 1.37–3.70) and those with the low (OR = 2.04,
95 % CI: 1.64–2.53) or medium level of education (OR =
1.71, 95 % CI: 1.46–2.01) were more likely to be classified
as ‘low-sedentary’. In contrast, when compared to the ref-
erence groups, obese individuals (OR = 0.77, 95 % CI:
0.63–0.93), those with poor self-related health (OR = 0.57,
95 % CI: 0.35–0.92) and those aged 25–34 years (OR =
0.70, 95 % CI: 0.54–0.91) were less likely to be classified as
‘low-sedentary’.
Overall, 8.9 % (95 % CI: 8.1–9.6) of the sample were
categorised as ‘high-risk’ with regards to their physical
activity and sedentary behaviour (Table 3). In the ad-
justed analysis, compared to adults reporting ‘excellent’
health, those in other self-rated health categories were
more likely to be in the ‘high-risk’ behaviour group
(Table 4). The ORs ranged from 1.65 (95 % CI: 1.12–2.44)
for ‘very good’ health category to 4.60 (95 % CI: 2.89–
7.33) for the ‘poor’ health category. When compared to
the youngest age group, those aged 25–34 (OR = 1.91,
95 % CI: 1.27–2.87) and 35–44 years (OR = 2.09, 95 % CI:
1.27–3.44) were more likely to be in the ‘high-risk’ group.
Current smokers (OR = 1.37, 95 % CI: 1.06–1.76) and
obese individuals (OR = 1.44, 95 % CI: 1.04–1.98) were
more likely to be classified in the ‘high-risk’ group than
those who never smoked and those with normal weight,
respectively.
Discussion
This paper is the first to concurrently establish the preva-
lence and correlates of MVPA, strength training and
sedentary behaviour among a national-representative sam-
ple of Australian adults.
The key finding of this study is that the vast majority
(85 %) of Australian adults did not meet the full physical
activity guidelines that incorporate both MVPA and
strength training. Previous studies assessing the preva-
lence of physical inactivity among Australian adults have
been solely based on MVPA levels, and show that 40 %–
50 % of Australians are insufficiently active for health
[5, 35, 60]. However, our results suggest that when
combining strength training and MVPA levels, the
prevalence of physical inactivity far exceeds previous
estimates. In fact, our findings suggest that estimating
population adherence to the physical activity recom-
mendations using only MVPA data may be largely
misleading and may not reveal the true extent of the
problem of inactivity.
When compared to the findings from U.S. population-
based studies [36, 44, 45], fewer Australian adults met
both the MVPA and strength training guidelines (15.0 %
vs. 18.2 %–20.6 %). Our prevalence estimate for meeting
the strength training guidelines is slightly higher than in
previous Australian studies. Among ~5, 800 participants
from the Australian Diabetes, Obesity and Lifestyle
(AusDiab) study [42], ~5, 700 from a sample of older
Australian adults (≥65 years) [45], and ~1, 200 adults
from regional Australia [41], the prevalence range was
9.4 %–15.5 % . However, when compared to data from
previous U.S. and UK studies, our findings suggest
that strength training participation among Australian
adults is somewhat lower (18.6 % vs. 21.9 %–31.7 %)
[36–40]. Furthermore, when compared to the most
recent
physical
activity
prevalence
data
from
the
WHO Global Health Observatory [35], the propor-
tions of Australians in our sample meeting the MVPA
guidelines is somewhat similar.
The importance of physical inactivity from a clinical
perspective
was
highlighted
in
a
recent
report
released by the Australian Institute of Health and
Welfare [61]. In that report, physical inactivity was
identified as the most prevalent risk factor for cardio-
vascular disease (57 % [note: based on insufficient
MVPA
levels
only]),
followed
by
high
cholesterol
(32.8 %) and high blood pressure (30 %). Given the
substantial
health
benefits
associated
with
regular
participation in both MVPA and strength training, the
low prevalence of Australian adults meeting these
guidelines is of serious concern for public health.
Comprehensive approaches are needed to promote
and support both aspects of physical activity concur-
rently at the population level.

 The sociodemographic correlates of strength training
and MVPA observed in this study are consistent with
existing data. Previous research has shown that older
age, lower education levels and having poor health are
associated with a lower prevalence of strength training
[62], MVPA [33] and combined strength training and
MVPA [37]. Our data underscore the importance of tar-
geting these population groups in health promotion
strategies. Particularly concerning was the finding that
over 80 % of Australians do not engage in sufficient
strength training. Research suggests that, independent of
MVPA, strength training has beneficial outcomes which
are important for health and wellbeing, such as preven-
tion and treatment of diabetes [12, 63] and cognitive de-
cline
[10]
and
improvements
and
maintenance
of
skeletal muscle mass/strength [10], bone mineral density
[64] and physical functioning [65]. More research is now
needed to examine the key factors influencing strength
training participation [66]. However, when contrasted
the decades of research examining the correlates and
predictors of leisure-time physical activity [33, 67, 68],
comparatively little is known about the key factors influ-
encing strength training.
This study examined only a small number of potential
correlates of MVPA and muscle-strengthening activities.
Future studies should move beyond this and examine
other
potential
socio-demographic,
lifestyle,
psycho-
logical (e.g. motivation, intentions), social (e.g. social
support, perceived social norms) and environmental fac-
tors (e.g. access to facilities, affordability) influencing
MVPA and strength training participation in the Austra-
lian adult population. Additionally, given that strength
training often requires equipment and specific know-
ledge in exercise instruction, future research may be
needed to evaluate the effectiveness of incentives, such
as
subsidising
equipment
(e.g.
resistance
bands,

 dumbbells) and fitness/health club memberships, to in-
crease muscle-strengthening activity participation rates.
The percentage of participants classified as ‘low-seden-
tary’ (<480 min/day) was somewhat lower than in a large
Australian study among ~6700 women [22] and in a
study from Japan among ~83,000 middle-aged and older
adults [69] (78.9 % vs. 83.5 % and 92.7 %, respectively).
These slight variations are likely to be explained by differ-
ences in samples and the use of diverse sedentary behav-
iour assessment tools. . Being classified as ‘high-sedentary’
was associated with overweight/obesity, higher education
and poorer self-rated health. These findings are somewhat
similar with research on the correlates of high volumes of
siting, which show a relationship between high sitting
volumes and poor health status, high BMI and high
education levels [46, 70]. The inverse associations between
age and sitting time are consistent with previous large-
scale studies using similar self-report measures [46, 47].
Furthermore, there are a number of other potential corre-
lates of sedentary behaviour [71]; however their analysis
was beyond the scope of this paper.
To our knowledge, this is the first study to determine
the proportion of the population at potentially high risk,
based on the clustering of ‘not meeting the MVPA
guidelines’
, ‘not meeting the strength training guidelines’
and being classified as ‘high-sedentary’. Assuming that
there may be cumulative health risks associated with
insufficient physical activity and excessive sedentary be-
haviour, this population group are of a particular public
health concern. The fact that there are up to 18.8 % of
people at the ‘high-risk’ in different population sub-
groups, should motivate public health stakeholders to
put even greater efforts in targeting prevention. The
odds of being classified as ‘high-risk’ were 4.6 times
higher among adults who reported ‘poor’ health when
compared to those who reported ‘excellent’ health.
Those classified as obese had ~44 % higher odds to be
in the ‘high-risk’ group than individuals with normal
BMI. These findings are somewhat consistent with
MVPA/strength training correlates research [33, 45], and
further underscore the need to target such groups in
health promotion strategies. Further studies using this
clustering approach of combining those with insuffi-
cient MVPA/strength training levels and high levels
of sedentary behaviour are needed to compare and
contrast our findings.
Strengths of this study include the involvement of a
large national-representative sample of Australian adults
[48]. Furthermore, the current study enabled assessment
of physical activity and sedentary behaviour across a
variety of sociodemographic and health-related variables.
A further strength was the use of standardised MVPA,
strength training and sedentary behaviour assessment
instruments, which allowed for comparisons with other
studies.
Limitations of the study were the use of self-report
measures of MVPA, strength training and sedentary
behaviour, which may have resulted in recall bias [72].
To improve the validity of estimates, future studies
might consider using accelerometers and inclinometers
to assess time spent in MVPA and sedentary behaviours/
sitting, and time-use diaries to assess strength training
participation. Nevertheless, for public health surveil-
lance, standardised self-report instruments seems to be
the method of choice for assessing the physical activity
and sedentary behaviour levels [73]. Furthermore, no
data was available on breaks in sitting time. Some of the
participants classified as ‘high sedentary’ might have re-
duced health risks of prolonged sitting by taking regular
Table 4 Adjusted odds ratiosa (OR), and their 95 % confidence
intervals (95 % CI), of being classified as ‘high-risk’, based on
reporting insufficient moderate to vigorous-intensity physical
activity (MVPA), insufficient strength training participation, and

 breaks in sedentary behaviour [74]. The frequency of
breaks in sitting time among Australian adults remains to
be explored in future national surveys. A further limitation
to this study was that, given its cross-sectional design, the
direction of causality could not have been determined. For
example, it may be that obesity lead to increased sitting
time [75], but it is also possible that the direction of
causality was opposite [76]. Furthermore, this study
investigated only a small number of selected sociode-
mographic and lifestyle variables related to MVPA,
muscle-strengthening activity and sedentary behaviour.
Future studies are needed to identify and describe
other potential correlates.
Conclusions
This study showed that the vast majority of Australian
adults do not meet the full PA recommendation that incor-
porates both MVPA and strength training. In particular,
our findings showing the low levels of strength training
among Australian adults warrant attention. While strength
training
is
an
important
component
of
physical
activity-related health, it has practically been ignored
by public health approaches to chronic disease pre-
vention. In addition to the continual population mon-
itoring of strength training and MVPA levels, public
health interventions should target subgroups at the
highest risk of low participation levels in these physical
activity-related behaviours (e.g. adults aged 55+ years,
females and those with low-education levels).
Furthermore, it seems that interventions to reduce sit-
ting time should target males, younger age groups, those
with high level of education, obese individuals and those
with poor self-rated health. Finally, multifaceted interven-
tions may be needed for those with poorer self-rated
health, obese individuals, those aged 25–44, and current
smokers, as they are at the highest risk of high sedentary
behaviour combined with insufficient MVPA and muscle-
strengthening activity.
