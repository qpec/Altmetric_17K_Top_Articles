Abstract
Background—With a growing focus on the importance of men’s reproductive health--including 
preconception health--the ways in which young men’s knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs (KAB) 
predict their reproductive paths are understudied.
Objective—To determine if reproductive KAB predicts fatherhood status, timing and residency 
(living with child or not).
Methods—Reproductive KAB and fatherhood outcomes were analyzed from the National 
Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, a 20-year, nationally representative study of individuals 
from adolescence into adulthood. Four measures of reproductive KAB were assessed during 
adolescence in Waves I and II. A generalized linear latent and mixed model predicted future

 fatherhood status (non-father, resident/nonresident father, adolescent father) and timing while 
controlling for other socio-demographic variables.
Results—Of the 10,253 males, 3425 were fathers (686 non-resident/2739 resident) by wave IV. 
Higher risky sexual behavior scores significantly increased the odds of becoming nonresident 
father (OR=1.30, p < 0.0001), resident father (OR=1.07, p = 0.007), and adolescent father 
(OR=1.71, p < 0.0001); higher pregnancy attitudes scores significantly increased the odds of 
becoming a nonresident father (OR=1.20, p < 0.0001) and resident father (O =1.11, p < 0.0001); 
higher birth control self-efficacy scores significantly decreased the odds of becoming a 
nonresident father (O =0.72, p < 0.0001), and adolescent father (OR=0.56, p = 0.01).
Conclusion—Young men’s KAB in adolescence predicts their future fatherhood and residency 
status. Strategies that address adolescent males' reproductive KAB are needed in the prevention of 
unintended reproductive consequences such as early and nonresident fatherhood.
Introduction
The field of reproductive health is turning attention toward understanding young men’s 
reproductive needs and outcomes. [1] Despite the growing recognition of the importance of 
young men in reproductive health programs and policies, [2, 3] knowledge is lacking 
regarding men’s reproductive health [4] including such factors as fatherhood status and 
timing. While many studies explore women’s knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs (KAB) and 
their reproductive outcomes, [5–7] little is known about such associations in men. Recent 
research has examined adolescent male’s reproductive KAB and their sexual behavior, 
including abstinence, and condom and contraception use;[8–10] however, due to data 
limitations these studies could not account for a central outcome--entrance into fatherhood. 
Measuring KAB during adolescence, a period when such knowledge about sexual and 
reproductive behavior is developed [11] has the potential to inform future outcomes such as 
fatherhood status, timing and residency.
Studying adolescent reproductive KAB and later fatherhood may lead to earlier 
identification of young men at-risk for becoming adolescent or nonresident fathers, and 
improve sexual education programs to address the needs of these young men thereby helping 
them take control of their reproductive outcomes. Adolescent and nonresident fathers are 
known to be younger, have less education, lower SES, and to be unemployed[12, 13] with 
nonresident fathers having less contact, involvement and quality interactions with their 
children than do resident fathers. [14–16] Though many unmarried couples are cohabitating 
at the time of the child’s birth, 63% of unmarried fathers are nonresident with their child 
after five years [14]. One compelling perspective for understanding young, nonresident 
fathers and their well-being suggests including reproductive cultural values and norms along 
with reproductive attitudes, aspirations, and resources as part of a conceptual framework of 
fatherhood. [17] The National Campaign to End Teenage and Unwanted Pregnancy lists 17 
characteristics of effective sexual education programs; paramount among them is to address 
“sexual psychosocial risk and protective factors that affect sexual behavior (e.g., knowledge, 
perceived risks, values, attitudes, perceived norms, and self-efficacy) and change them.”[18] 
Thus, education programs that focus on KAB during the formative adolescent years may be 
particular useful in preventing future unintended transitions to fatherhood.

 The primary goal of this study is to determine if certain adolescent reproductive KAB 
predict fatherhood status, timing and residency. Data come from the National Longitudinal 
Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), which followed a nationally representative 
sample of American youth from adolescence through early adulthood. This large, 
longitudinal, and nationally-representative data set allows better understanding of the 
reproductive paths young men take, fostering associations between adolescent KAB and 
later fatherhood outcomes. Understanding these connections may help identify at-risk young 
men earlier, allowing preventive interventions that address these men’s reproductive KAB.
Methods
Study Design and Sample
The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) is a longitudinal study 
of a nationally representative sample of youth focusing on social, behavioral, and biomedical 
health as they progress from adolescence into adulthood. Wave I (n=10,253 males, ages=12–
21; Response rate (RR):79%) was conducted in 1994–95; Wave II (n=7192, ages=13–21; 
RR:88.6%) in 1996; Wave III (n=7192, ages=18–28; RR:77.4%) six years later in 2001–02, 
and Wave IV (n=7347, ages=25–34; RR:80.3%) in 2007–08. Procedures for data access and 
analysis were implemented per our Institutional Review Board and in agreement with the 
Add Health data security plan.
Variables
Fatherhood status—Fatherhood status was the outcome of interest in this study. It was 
coded into three categories: non-fathers (referent), nonresident fathers, and resident fathers. 
At each wave, men reported in the household roster whether they had a biological child 
living with them; beginning in wave 3, men reported in the live child data set whether they 
fathered a biological child at all. If the same child is listed in the live child data set and the 
household roster, the father was categorized as a resident father. If a child was listed only in 
the live child data set, the father was categorized as a non-resident father. If no child was 
listed in either, the man was categorized as a non-father. If a biological child was listed only 
in the household roster (as may have occurred prior to wave 3), then the father was 
categorized as a resident father. Resident and non-resident fatherhood status was established 
at the earliest wave a biological child was listed and held constant through all future waves.
Reproductive knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs—Reproductive KAB was measured 
using four scales from data in both Waves I and II. Add Health contained no intact surveys 
or scales from pre-existing literature, building instead on a number of successful past 
surveys of adolescents and adults. [19] Three of the four measures used—1) risky sexual 
behavior scales, 2) pregnancy attitudes, and 3) birth control self-efficacy -- were 
administered in the student’s home by an interviewer. The fourth measure, 4) birth control 
attitudes, was administered via audio-CASI technology due to sensitivity. Each item was 
answered on a 5-point scale from “strongly agree” to “strongly disagree” except where 
otherwise noted. The KAB scales from both Waves I and II were used as individual variables 
in all analyses.

 The risky sexual behavior scale (RSB) is a 10-item scale assessing reasons for engaging in 
or not engaging in sexual intercourse. This scale has been used in numerous studies 
investigating sexual and contraceptive behaviors, unintended pregnancies and sexually 
transmitted infections[20–23] Participants were presented with statements such as “If you 
had sexual intercourse your friends would respect you more’’ and “If you had sexual 
intercourse, you would feel less lonely. “ Higher scores indicated a greater motivation to 
engage in risky sexual behaviors.
The pregnancy attitude scale (PA) is a 2-item scale assessing the perceived impact of a 
pregnancy on the respondent’s life. [6, 24] Participants were presented with the statements 
“Getting someone pregnant at this time in your life is one of the worst things that could 
happen to you” and “It wouldn’t be all that bad if you got someone pregnant at this time in 
your life.” Higher scores indicate a more positive attitude towards getting someone pregnant.
The birth control self-efficacy scale (BCSE) is a 3-item scale assessing the perceived ability 
to ensure the use of birth control during sexual intercourse, used previously in studies of 
adolescent contraceptive usage [23–25] Each item was answered on a 6-point scale from 
“very sure” to “very unsure”, with the additional option of “I never want to use birth 
control”. Higher scores indicated a greater sense of self-efficacy to use birth control.
The birth control attitudes scale (BCA) is a 7-item scale assessing reasons for using or not 
using birth control.[23] Participants were presented with statements such as “In general, 
birth control is too much of a hassle to use” and “Using birth control interferes with sexual 
enjoyment.” Higher scores indicated a greater motivation to use birth control.
All four KAB scales were standardized to a continuous, standard normal distribution for 
both Waves I and II.
Socio-demographic variables—Socio-demographic variables were included in the 
analyses to control for confounding effects. Mother’s education, family income and 
participant’s self-reported race measured at wave I were included in the analyses. 
Participant’s education, personal income (if family income not used), age, and general health 
(an ordinal self-reported measure assessing health on a scale from “poor” to “excellent”) 
measured at Waves I through IV were included in the analyses. Age and marital status were 
removed from the analysis of adolescent fatherhood status due to their both being perfectly 
predictive of the outcome.
Statistical Analysis
In order to diagnose measures of validity, reliability, and unidimensionality (i.e. whether the 
scales measured a single construct) of the four latent constructs for both waves, classical 
item analyses were run including Cronbach’s alphas to measure internal consistency, item-
rest correlations to measure homogeneity, and the ratio of the first two eigenvalues to assess 
dimensionality.
A logistic regressions was used to predict the odds of becoming an adolescent father given 
the KAB scales and key demographic variables (excepting age and marital status). A

 multinomial logistic regression was then used to predict the odds of becoming either a 
nonresident or resident father (compared to a non-father) given the above scales and 
independent variables. These regressions were modeled using a generalized linear latent and 
mixed model (GLLAMM), resulting in four repeated measures for each participant, and 
allowing each wave to act as a level-1 cluster. [26] Sample participants were classified 
within the GLLAMM into one of three fatherhood categories: non-fathers (referent), 
nonresident fathers, and resident fathers. When modeling the odds of becoming an 
adolescent father, the participants were classified into one of two categories: adolescent 
father (<18-years-old) and adult father (≥18-years-old; referent). To account for certain 
ethnicities being oversampled in Add Health (e.g. Blacks from higher educated families, 
Chinese, Cuban, and Puerto Rican participants), Add Health longitudinal weights were used 
in all analyses. Further, to account for this oversampling a level-2 random intercept was 
determined for race. All analyses were conducted in Stata 12.1 with multiple imputations of 
five cycles calculated to account for missing data. [27]
Results
Sample demographics
Of the 10,253 men in the sample, 3425 (33.5%) were fathers and 6828 (66.5%) were non-
fathers by Wave 4. Of the fathers, 686 (20.0%) were nonresident and 2739 (80.0%) were 
resident (Table 1). Most resident fathers were married (72%), compared with nonresident 
fathers (8%) and non-fathers (13%). Equal numbers of nonresident fathers were white and 
African American. Resident fathers and non-fathers had more education than nonresident 
fathers. Additional demographic characteristics can be found in Table 1.
KAB scale diagnostics
Table A1 (online appendix) provides descriptive statistics of each KAB scale at Waves I and 
II. Psychometric properties were assessed by the totality of the information at both waves. 
By Wave II, all of the scales had a coefficient alpha of at least 0.70 with the two shortest 
scales each being slightly under 0.7 in Wave I. The item-rest correlations for all items were 
above 0.2 and the mean item-rest correlations for each scale were above 0.4 at each Wave.
[28] The eigenvalue ratio, which determines whether the cumulative variance of the items in 
a scale can be explained by a single factor, exceeded the recommended value of 4.0 for all 
scales except the two-item Perceived Pregnancy Attitude scale.
Fatherhood status and adolescent KAB
Three of the four adolescent reproductive KAB scales collected during adolescence 
predicted future fatherhood status controlling for key socio-demographic variables for all of 
the analyses: risky sexual behaviors, pregnancy attitudes, and birth control self-efficacy 
(Table 2 and Table 3). The birth control attitudes scale was not statistically significant for 
either analysis.
Table 2 provides results of the logistic regression comparing the odds of becoming an 
adolescent father compared to an adult father. Risky sexual behaviors were positively 
associated with the odds of becoming an adolescent father compared to an adult father with

 an increase in the odds ratio by 71% (OR=1.71, p<0.0001) for every one SD increase in 
risky sexual behaviors score. A single SD increase in the birth control self-efficacy score 
was associated with a 44% decrease in the odds ratio of becoming an adolescent father 
(OR=0.56, p=0.01).
Table 3 provides results of the multinomial logistic regression comparing the odds of 
becoming either a non-resident father or resident father compared to a non-father. A one SD 
higher risky sexual behavior score increased the odds ratio of becoming a nonresident father 
by 30% (OR=1.30, p-value<0.0001) and increased the odds ratio of becoming a resident 
father by 7% (OR=1.07, p-value=0.007). A single SD higher pregnancy attitudes score was 
related to an increase of 20% in the odds ratio of becoming a nonresident father (OR=1.20, 
p-value<0.0001) and an 11% increase in the odds ratio of becoming a resident father 
(OR=1.11, p-value<0.0001). A one unit SD higher birth control self-efficacy score was 
related to a decrease in the odds ratio of becoming a nonresident father by 28% (OR=0.72, 
p-value<0.0001), as might be expected, but it was not statistically significantly related with 
the odds of becoming a resident father (OR=0.93, p-value=0.75). The birth control attitudes 
scale was not statistically significant in predicting the odds of becoming either a nonresident 
father or resident father. Figure 1 provides bar plots of the estimates of becoming an 
adolescent father (comparison is to adult father), of becoming a non-resident father, and of 
becoming a resident father (comparison is to non-fathers.).
Tables 2 and 3 also list the odds ratios of fatherhood status for the control variables. 
Mother’s education and own education decreased the odds of becoming an adolescent father 
(Table 2). When estimating the odds of becoming either a non-resident or resident father 
compared to a non-father, income level, employment status, marital status, and age were all 
positively related to the odds of becoming a resident father. However, only age was 
statistically significant among these variables when predicting the odds of becoming a 
nonresident father. Higher mother’s education decreased the odds of becoming a resident 
father but a higher personal education decreased the odds of becoming a nonresident father.
Discussion
In this study of associations between reproductive KAB and future fatherhood outcomes in a 
nationally representative sample, we find that several attitudes and beliefs identified during 
adolescence can predict both fatherhood and residency status in our sample of young adults 
up to age 34, after controlling for key variables such as age, income, race, maternal 
education, health, employment and marriage. Young men scoring higher on a risky sexual 
behavior scale during adolescence were more likely to become fathers of any type with a 
greater increase in odds for nonresident than resident father status and adolescent father 
status (<18 years) compared to adult father status. Similarly, men who had more positive 
attitudes towards pregnancy during adolescence were more likely to be fathers, with a 
greater increase in odds for nonresident father status. Greater birth control self-efficacy 
predicted lower odds of becoming a father overall but, if a father, more likely to be a resident 
father and more likely to be an adult father.

 Adolescence is a key developmental period for reproductive KAB, and many health KAB 
and behaviors established during adolescence persist into adulthood. While past studies have 
identified how adolescent reproductive KAB affects initiation of sexual intercourse, 
contraceptive use, and pregnancy during adolescence, [5–8, 10, 20, 23, 24] these studies 
were unable to address how these KAB formed during adolescence impact pregnancy 
outcomes later in life for men. As many of these prior studies focus exclusively on women, 
[5–7] it is particularly important to investigate this relationship for men in order to better 
understand the paths leading to various fatherhood states. This study establishes that many 
of the KAB that are associated with adolescents’ sexual and contraceptive behavior during 
adolescence continue to be associated with their reproductive outcomes into young 
adulthood.
Examining certain KAB responses more closely, endorsement of risky sexual behavior and 
pregnancy attitudes had the strongest associations with becoming a father, and among 
fathers, a greater odds of being a nonresident father, while greater birth control self-efficacy 
decreased the odds of becoming a father at all, or if a father, it significantly decreased the 
odds of being a nonresident father. The first two associations are likely due to the fact that 
risky sexual behavior and ambivalent attitudes toward pregnancy may contribute to a higher 
risk of unplanned pregnancy. In turn, unplanned pregnancy puts men at higher risk for 
nonresident fatherhood, with its potential detrimental effects on father involvement, child 
academic performance, and child behavioral development. [29, 30] A similar explanation 
may be applicable to birth control self-efficacy, which was only statistically significant 
among nonresident fathers. Lower birth control self-efficacy may lead to greater unprotected 
sex, which is likely to result in an unplanned pregnancy and a nonresident father. Therefore, 
for men who become resident fathers, it may be that the pregnancy is more likely to be 
planned, and thus men who have the self-efficacy and confidence [10] to avoid unprotected 
sex may be choosing to become fathers with more intention. The lack of significance around 
the birth control attitudes score may reflect the deficit in knowledge among adolescents from 
certain regions in the US regarding birth control and the reproductive system in general [23, 
39]. While birth control self-efficacy presupposes a confidence about the knowledge of using 
birth control successfully, attitudes towards birth control do not. Thus birth control attitudes 
may not be as useful an instrument for predicting fatherhood outcomes as self-efficacy.
The ability to identify young men during adolescence who have reproductive KAB that are 
predictive of non-optimal fatherhood paths has the potential to pave the way for more 
effective interventions. If those most at risk can be identified during adolescence, before they 
have entered fatherhood, educational programming and support can be provided that may 
change their reproductive trajectories, as has been shown in adolescent women.[31, 32] 
Programming and interventions for adolescent male reproductive health is an understudied 
and underdeveloped area and therefore the ideal form of such support is not evident.
As young men are historically the least likely to be engaged in the healthcare system, the 
first challenge may be finding and connecting with young males. One possibility is school-
based teen clinics, which have successfully provided interventions for adolescent females, 
although no such positive results have been found thus far for adolescent men. [33] Clinics 
outside of a school setting specifically designed to target young men, such as the Young

 Men’s Clinic at New York-Presbyterian, [34] may also serve as a base from which to 
provide interventions. Community-based programming has proven effective in addressing 
HIV risk reduction, [35] and may be a useful approach for addressing men’s’ reproductive 
KAB.
Developmentally appropriate programs designed to engage young men as they are forming 
their reproductive KAB are essential. [18, 36, 37] One promising approach is preconception 
health care for men. [36, 38] Education surrounding reproductive KAB can be part of such 
care, and begin as early as adolescence. Although ideally these young men will not be 
entering fatherhood until later in the life-course, providing support during adolescence, 
especially to men at risk for entering fatherhood early or becoming nonresident fathers, may 
have a positive effect if and when these men do become fathers. Intervening early, especially 
before the entrance into fatherhood, can help identify risks to young men’s physical and 
mental health, resulting in a potentially healthier male, partner and fathers. [39]
Our study has limitations. First, although Add Health is a longitudinal study, the 
reproductive KAB survey was only administered at waves I and II and therefore changes in 
participants later KAB are unknown. Additionally, as a longitudinal study with 4 data 
collection time points, our data cannot begin to pinpoint the exact relationship between 
KAB, sexual behaviors, and timing of fatherhood. However, identifying associations 
between adolescent KAB endorsement and time to fatherhood is contingent upon first 
identifying associations between the two as we have shown. Second, fatherhood residency is 
constrained to one entry per participant so we cannot account for changes some fathers may 
have had between non-resident and resident fatherhood. Finally, due to study design and 
timing, our sample consists of younger fathers. However, resident fathers’ age of fatherhood 
entry, 25, is the same as the National Survey of Family Growth’s age at first birth for men.
CONCLUSION
Growing attention is being paid to the importance of including young men in sexual and 
reproductive health research across the life course and how KAB in adolescence lays a 
foundation for future outcomes. In this longitudinal, nationally-representative sample of 
young men followed from adolescences through young adulthood, we find that their 
adolescent reproductive KAB predict future fatherhood and residency status. Knowing 
which young men may be at-risk for early or nonresident fatherhood allows for innovative 
educational programs and public health interventions that focus on prevention for young 
men in adolescence.
