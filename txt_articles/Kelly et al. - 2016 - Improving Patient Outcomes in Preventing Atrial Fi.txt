Background Several non–vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant (NOAC) alternatives to warfarin are available for
stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation (AF). We aimed to describe the factors associated with selection of NOACs versus
warfarin in patients with new onset AF.
Methods The ORBIT-AF II study is a national, US, prospective, observational, cohort study of anticoagulation treatment in
patients with AF receiving NOACs or warfarin in the United States from 2013 to 2016. We measured factors associated with
oral anticoagulant selection in 4,670 patients recently diagnosed with AF.
Results At baseline, 1,169 (25%) patients were started on warfarin and 3,501 (75%) on NOACs: of these latter, 259
(6%) were started on dabigatran, 1858 (40%) on rivaroxaban, and 1384 (30%) on apixaban. Those receiving NOACs were
slightly younger patients (median age 71 vs 72, P b .0001); were less likely to have prior stroke (5.3% vs 8.6%; P b .0001) or
prior bleeding (2.7% vs 4.4%; P = .005); had better kidney function (mean estimated glomerular filtration rate 91 mL/min vs
80 mL/min, P b .0001); and had fewer patients at high stroke risk (CHA2DS2-VASc score [Congestive heart failure,
Hypertension, Age ≥ 75 years, Diabetes mellitus, Prior stroke, transient ischemic attack {TIA}, or thromboembolism,Vascular
disease, Age 65–74 years, Sex category {female}] ≥ 2 in 86% vs 93%; P b .0001). In multivariable analysis, factors
associated with NOAC selection versus warfarin included renal function, prior stroke or valve replacement, rhythm control AF
management strategy, treatment by a cardiologist, and higher patient education level.
Conclusions In contemporary clinical practice, up to three-fourths of patients with new-onset AF are now initially treated
with a NOAC for stroke prevention. Those selected for NOAC treatment had lower stroke and bleeding risk profiles, were
more likely treated by cardiologists, and had higher socioeconomic status.

Clinical Investigation
 Prevention of stroke is a major priority for patients with
atrial fibrillation (AF), and there is robust clinical
evidence demonstrating that oral anticoagulation (OAC)
with vitamin K antagonists (eg, warfarin) can effectively
prevent stroke or systemic embolism and reduce
mortality in patients with AF.1,2 However, warfarin is
associated with a significant increase in bleeding,
including intracranial hemorrhage, and its other short-
comings related to adjusted dosing and myriad food and
drug interactions are well known. Therefore, the
emergence of non–vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagu-
lants (NOACs) directly targeting thrombin or factor Xa
was a welcome development for treatment of patients
with AF. In each of their respective phase 3 trials, these
agents were demonstrated to be at least as safe and as
effective as warfarin,3-6 and as a group, they appear to
hold significant advantages over warfarin.7
However, the decision among anticoagulation strategies
is primarily left to the physician, and guidelines have only
recently expressed a preference for NAOCs, as a class, over
warfarin.8,9 Physicians must first determine if a patient is
eligible for a NOAC and then decide whether to institute
NOAC or warfarin for stroke prevention. To date, little is
known about how clinicians select patients to receive
NOACs versus alternative therapy. The objectives of this
analysis are (1) to describe current patterns of OAC use
among patients initiating treatment for new-onset AF in
community practice, (2) to describe patterns of selection
for NOAC over warfarin, and (3) to describe factors
associated with selection of a NOAC (vs warfarin).
Methods
Phase II of the Outcomes Registry for Better Informed
Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation (ORBIT-AF II) is a prospec-
tive, national registry of outpatients with AF. In contrast to
the first phase, ORBIT-AF II was specifically geared toward
assessing OAC treatment decisions, particularly in patients
with new-onset AF. Therefore, the inclusion criteria
specified that the patient either (a) be recently diagnosed
with AF (within 6 months) and/or (b) be recently
transitioned to a NOAC for stroke prevention (within 3
months). Additional inclusion criteria were adult patients
21 years or older with electrocardiographically confirmed
AF not due to a reversible cause (eg, thyrotoxicosis, acute
pulmonary embolism, post–cardiac surgery) who are
followed clinically at least as frequently as every 6 months.
Consecutive, eligible patients were enrolled from a
nationally representative sample of primary care physi-
cians, cardiologists, electrophysiologists, and neurologists.
Study coordination, site management, and data analyses
were performed by the Duke Clinical Research Institute.
Data entry was performed using a Web-based case report
and derived primarily from the patient's medical record.
Data elements included patient demographics, prior
medical and surgical history, vital signs, electrocardio-
graphic data, imaging and laboratory results, and medical
and procedure therapies. Documentation of medical
therapy included OAC therapies, as well as other medical
therapies, such as antiplatelet, antiarrhythmic, and other
cardiovascular medications. For anticoagulants, dosing
was documented, as well as international normalized
ratio data (for patients on warfarin) and any contraindi-
cations to OAC (as determined by the patient's physi-
cian). Additional details of the ORBIT-AF II design and
rationale have been previously described.10
The present analysis included only patients with newly
diagnosed AF (defined as those with a new diagnosis of
AF within the previous 6 months), who were initiated on
OAC at baseline evaluation. We subsequently compared
baseline characteristics among patients receiving each
OAC therapy. Use of NOAC versus warfarin was also
compared among subgroups of interest: by age, prior
stroke, prior gastrointestinal bleeding, any prior major
bleeding, CHA2DS2-VASc score (Congestive heart failure,
Hypertension, Age ≥ 75 years, Diabetes mellitus, Prior
stroke, transient ischemic attack [TIA], or thromboem-
bolism,Vascular disease, Age 65–74 years, Sex category
[female]), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR),
payer, provider specialty, and geographic region. Prior
to multivariate comparisons, we also assessed site
variability in use of each OAC agent. Lastly, factors
associated with NOACs as class versus warfarin, and
individual NOAC versus warfarin, were assessed using
multivariable models.
Statistical methods
Univariate comparisons are presented as counts and
percentages for categorical variables and medians (inter-
quartile range) or means (standarddeviation) for continuous
variables. They were compared using the χ2 test for
categorical variables and the Wilcoxon rank sum test for
continuous variables. χ2 tests were also used to compare
rates of NOAC use among subgroups of interest.
Site variability with respect to OAC use was measured
using histograms with proportion of patients on the
x-axis and proportion of sites on the y-axis for each agent.
Sites with b10 subjects (n = 93 sites) were excluded from
this and all subsequent aspects of these analyses.
Multivariable hierarchical logistic regression was used to
identify factors significantly associated with selection of
NOAC versus warfarin. Covariates included in the final
model were determined using a backward selection
process (see candidate covariates in the Supplemental
Material, Supplementary Table 1), with an α for exclusion
of .05. Logistic regression was used for this process, and
then the final model was repeated using the hierarchical
model to account for variation in OAC use by site. All sites
were included in this analysis. Imputed data were used to
account for any missing covariate data. All continuous
variables were tested for linearity, and nonlinear relation-
ships were accounted for using linear splines. The odds

 ratio (OR) of NOAC relative to warfarin use is presented for
all covariates in the final hierarchical model, along with
their corresponding 95% CI and P value. In addition, the
median OR for site will be calculated. This measure
quantifies the variation between sites and must be equal
to 1 or greater. A value of 1 indicates that there is no
variation between sites, whereas greater numbers indicate
greater variation.
To identify factors associated with individual NOAC
selection, multivariable hierarchical logistic regression

 models were used. Covariate candidates and selection are
similar to above. Logistic regression was used for this
process, and then the final model was repeated using the
hierarchical model to account for variation in NOAC/
warfarin use by site. Because of a significant number of
sites that used either exclusively 1 OAC or warfarin and 1
specific NOAC, a single model with all NOACs could not
be created (because site was too commonly perfectly
confounded with NOAC). Therefore, pairwise models
were constructed to identify patient-related factors
associated with selection of a specific NOAC versus
warfarin. Lastly, the same methodology was used to
identify factors associated with one NOAC over another,
where sufficient patients were available in individual
drug groups.
All subjects provided written, informed consent, and
each site received institutional review board approval for
this study, pursuant to local regulations. The ORBIT-AF II
registry is sponsored by Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC,
(Raritan, NJ) and approved by the Duke University
institutional review board. Analyses of the aggregate
data were performed by the Duke Clinical Research
Institute using SAS software (version 9.4; SAS Institute,
Cary, NC). The authors are solely responsible for the
design and conduct of this study, all study analyses, the
drafting and editing of the paper, and its final contents.
Sensitivity analyses
To assess the impact of potential local site preferences,
distribution of OAC agent use across sites was measured.
The above multivariable analysis of NOAC versus warfarin
was repeated, excluding any site that used the same OAC
drug for 90% or more of their subjects (a total of 93 sites,
347 subjects excluded).
Results
The overall ORBIT-AF II population included 11,603
patients from 242 sites enrolled from February, 2013, to
January, 2016. A total of 6,933 patients were excluded
because of preexisting AF (n = 5,963), not being on any
OAC at baseline (n = 934), or use of an OAC agent used in
b5% of patients (edoxaban) at baseline (n = 36). This
yielded an analysis population of 4,670 patients receiving
OAC at baseline. Of these, 1,169 (25%) were initially
started on warfarin, 259 on dabigatran (5.5%), 1,858
(40%) on rivaroxaban, and 1,384 (30%) on apixaban.
Baseline characteristics of these groups are shown in
Table I. Patients receiving treatment with NOACs were
significantly younger than those receiving warfarin
(P b .01), were less likely to have CHA2DS2-VASc score
≥2 (P b .01), were less likely to be treated with

 (P b .01), and were more likely to receive care from an
electrophysiologist (P b .01).
Selection of NOAC versus warfarin in patients with
new-onset AF, stratified by subgroups of interest, is
shown in Figure 1. Across groups of age, prior stroke,
prior bleeding, CHA2DS2-VASc, and eGFR, patients with
lower risk were more likely to be treated with NOAC,
whereas those in the higher-risk subgroup were relatively
more likely to receive warfarin. There were significant
differences in use of NOAC versus warfarin across
provider specialty and US geographical location
(P b .01 for each).
Results of hierarchical, logistical regression to identify
factors associated with NOAC use versus warfarin use are
shown in Table II. After adjustment, factors associated
with selection of NOAC versus warfarin included
educational status, renal function, stroke and bleeding
risk, and AF treatment strategy. There was also strong
variation among sites with respect to the selection of a
NOAC (median OR for site 3.11, Figure 2).
In analysis of individual NOAC selection, logistical
regression models were created for rivaroxaban versus
warfarin and apixaban versus warfarin, as well as
rivaroxaban versus apixaban; too few patients per site
were available to accurately model dabigatran. In each of
these models, factors associated with selection of the
individual NOAC (rivaroxaban or apixaban) over warfarin
were very similar and included the following: level of
education; eGFR; hematocrit; physician specialty; and
absence of dialysis, prior stroke/TIA, heart failure, or
prior valve replacement (Table III). In a model of
rivaroxaban versus apixaban (Table IV), apixaban selec-
tion appeared associated with older age, anemia, and
underlying conduction disease (by electrocardiogram
features). However, site itself remained an important
influence on treatment selection in these models (OR
3.01 for rivaroxaban vs warfarin; OR 3.75 for apixaban vs
warfarin; OR 2.43 for rivaroxaban vs apixaban).
Sensitivity analyses
In multivariate models excluding sites that used the
same medication type (NOAC vs warfarin) for 90+% of
their patients (n = 93 sites excluded), factors associated
with NOAC use were similar to those identified by the
primary analysis. These included level of education
(P b .0001), renal function (P = .0048), prior stroke/TIA
(P = .01), and AF treatment strategy (P = .01, Supple-
mental Material, Supplementary Table II).
Discussion
Appropriate selection of stroke prevention therapy in
patients with AF is vital to improving outcomes in this
population; the time of diagnosis represents a pivotal
opportunity to meet this objective. Our analysis yields
several important findings about OAC selection in these
patients. First, NOACs have now become the primary
anticoagulation strategy for a majority of patients with
new-onset AF. Second, patients selected to receive a
NOAC were at lower risk for stroke and bleeding
compared with those treated with warfarin. Lastly,
there appear to be socioeconomic and operational factors
driving NOAC selection, such as their use in more
educated patients and in patients treated by AF

 specialists, and provider-specific considerations. These
appear to be consistent among specific NOACs compared
with warfarin.
Our study did demonstrate that there remained a
significant proportion of patients with new-onset AF who
are initially treated with warfarin. This could be due to
several factors. Some patients have known contraindica-
tions to NOACs including those with rheumatic valvular
disease, severe renal impairment, or the presence of a
mechanical valve. Second, during our study period, there
were no approved, targeted NOAC reversal agents for
patients with bleeding in the setting of a NOAC. This may
have tempered enthusiasm among some patients or
physicians. Indeed, we did find some tendency for
patients with higher risk for bleeding to be treated with
warfarin rather than a NOAC.
Familiarity with prescribing NOACs may still be a
challenge. Our data demonstrate that cardiologist and
electrophysiology subspecialists were significantly more
likely than primary care physicians to prescribe a NOAC.
Lastly, cost is often the limiting factor in treatment
selection for patients. We also found that socioeconomic
status (measured by education level) did appear to be
related to the utilization of NOAC drugs as well.
Once the decision was made to select a NOAC, our
pairwise models of rivaroxaban versus warfarin and
apixaban versus warfarin demonstrated that nearly
identical factors influenced care decisions. That is, similar
factors were associated with selection of rivaroxaban
over warfarin compared with apixaban over warfarin,
and there appeared to be significant variability by site.
When we limited the models to only rivaroxaban versus
apixaban, fewer factors were significantly associated
with selection of one NOAC over another, and
they appeared driven primarily by age; anemia; renal
function; underlying conduction disease; and, to a large
extent, site.
Together, these data demonstrate that site variability is
a major driver of anticoagulation selection for patients
newly diagnosed with AF, including selection of NOACs
over warfarin and selection of one NOAC over another.
The influence of site on selection of NOAC over warfarin
may be related to local familiarity with these agents,
similar to the influence of physician specialty—whereas
some specialists will have more comfort with newer
drugs, some sites within specialty may have more
exposure, experience, and familiarity with specific
agents. When selecting among NOACs, in the absence
of robust head-to-head data, it is not surprising that local
site factors come into play. Although there are differences
among these agents and in relation to specific subgroups,
the guidelines do not specifically discriminate among
them. Physicians tend to select those with which they are
most comfortable and knowledgeable.
These results highlight the complex, nonmedical
decision-making processes around anticoagulation therapy
for patients with new-onset AF. To realize the potential
improvement in clinical outcomes with such treatment
advances as NOACs, these data suggest further that
implementation strategies, including improved access,
patient selection, and patient and/or provider education,
may be necessary.
Limitations
Site and/or patient sampling may limit the external
validity of these data, as well as payer influences that are not
captured. We cannot exclude the possibility of unmea-
sured confounding, particularly site-specific factors, in the
multivariable results. In addition, this analysis represents a
single snapshot during a period of likely dynamic
prescribing patterns that may change and/or stabilize
over time. This is particularly important given current cost
considerations with newer medications; as they become
more affordable and as patients and physicians become
more comfortable with them, agent selection is likely to
evolve. Other national and international analyses have
identified growth in the uptake of NOACs.11,12
Conclusions
In contemporary clinical practice, NOACs account for
nearly three-fourths of all oral anticoagulation for stroke
prevention in patients with a new-diagnosis of AF. We
also found that use was still preferentially tilted toward
those who were younger and lower-risk patients. This
may shift over time as studies demonstrate relative
efficacy and safety in both low- and high-risk groups
and with the development of targeted NOAC reversal
agents. Finally, although several patient factors are
associated with NOAC use, physician preference and

 patient education levels appear to be prime drivers of
treatment decisions. Improved understanding of factors
that influence OAC selection will be important as initiatives
seek to improve stroke prevention and AF outcomes across
several levels of care, including providers, clinics, and at
the health care system level.
