Abstract
Background
In August 2014, the so-called Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) attacked the Yazidi reli-
gious minority living in the area of Mount Sinjar in Nineveh governorate, Iraq. We conducted
a retrospective household survey to estimate the number and demographic profile of Yazidis
killed and kidnapped.
Methods and findings
The survey covered the displaced Yazidi population from Sinjar residing in camps in the Kur-
distan Region of Iraq. Fieldwork took place between 4 November and 25 December, 2015.
A systematic random sample of 1,300 in-camp households were interviewed about the cur-
rent household composition and any killings and kidnappings of household members by
ISIS. Of the 1,300 interviewed households, 988 were Yazidi from Sinjar. Yazidi households
contained 6,572 living residents at the time of the survey; 43 killings and 83 kidnappings of
household members were reported. We calculated the probability of being killed and kid-
napped by dividing the number of reported killings and kidnappings by the number of sam-
pled Yazidis at risk, adjusting for sampling design. To obtain the overall toll of killings and
kidnappings, those probabilities were multiplied by the total Yazidi population living in Sinjar
at the time of the ISIS attack, estimated at roughly 400,000 by the United Nations and Kurd-
ish officials. The demographic profile of those killed and kidnapped was examined, distin-
guishing between children and adults and females and males. We estimated that 2.5% of
the Yazidi population was either killed or kidnapped over the course of a few days in August
2014, amounting to 9,900 (95% CI 7,000–13,900) people in total. An estimated 3,100
(95% CI 2,100–4,400) Yazidis were killed, with nearly half of them executed—either shot,
beheaded, or burned alive—while the rest died on Mount Sinjar from starvation, dehydra-
tion, or injuries during the ISIS siege. The estimated number kidnapped is 6,800 (95% CI

Funding: This study was funded by the Emirates

 4,200–10,800). Escapees recounted the abuses they had suffered, including forced reli-
gious conversion, torture, and sex slavery. Over one-third of those reported kidnapped were
still missing at the time of the survey. All Yazidis were targeted regardless of age and sex,
but children were disproportionately affected. They were as likely as adults to be executed
but constituted 93.0% (95% CI 71.9–98.6) of those who died on Mount Sinjar. Moreover,
children only accounted for 18.8% (95% CI 8.4–36.9) of those who managed to escape cap-
tivity. A sensitivity analysis suggests that the actual toll of killings and kidnappings may be
underestimated in our data because of survival bias. The uncertainty associated with infer-
ence from a small sample of in-camp households and the reliance on a rough figure of
400,000 for extrapolation to the total Yazidi population of Sinjar at the time of the ISIS attack
are the main limitations of this study.
Conclusions
Consistent with other existing evidence, our data provide a clear indication of the severity of
the ISIS attack against the Yazidis in terms of both the number and demographic profile of
those targeted.
Author summary
Why was this study done?
• According to lists compiled by local authorities and human rights organisations,
between 2,000 and 5,500 Yazidis were killed and more than 6,000 were kidnapped dur-
ing the ISIS attack on Mount Sinjar in August 2014.
• The United Nations has not yet been able to independently verify these figures.
• This retrospective household survey provides the first population-based estimates of the
number and demographic profile of Yazidis killed and kidnapped by ISIS.
What did the researchers do and find?
• Between 4 November and 25 December, 2015, we collected data from a random sample
of displaced Yazidi households from Sinjar living in camps in the Kurdistan Region of
Iraq.
• We used these data to estimate the overall number of killings and kidnappings and the
respective proportions of children and adults and females and males.
• Our estimated toll of killings and kidnappings corroborate the figures reported by local
authorities and human rights organisations.
• We found that executions were indiscriminate, but children accounted for nearly all
those who died on Mount Sinjar from lack of water and food or injuries during the ISIS
siege; kidnappings were also indiscriminate, but children were much less likely to escape
captivity than adults.

Introduction
During the summer of 2014, the so-called Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) subjugated
Nineveh governorate in Northern Iraq. Nineveh has historically been home to most of Iraq’s
minority groups, including Yazidis, Assyrian and Chaldean Christians, Sabaean-Mandaeans,
Turkmen, Shabak, and Kaka’i. These minorities were systematically targeted by ISIS in its vio-
lent campaign to “purify” the region from non-Islamic influences [1]. Yazidis, whom ISIS mili-
tants consider “devil worshippers,” were singled out for particularly brutal treatment [2].
The Yazidis practice an ancient religion that contains elements of Zoroastrianism, Judaism,
Christianity, and Islam. They number less than 1.5 million, living mainly in Iraq, Syria, Tur-
key, and Armenia. The largest Yazidi community—approximately 400,000 people—resided in
the area of Mount Sinjar, some 150 km west of Mosul in Nineveh governorate (Fig 1) [3,4].
The Yazidis of Sinjar have long been one of the most vulnerable and impoverished communi-
ties in Iraq. After having suffered from decades of discrimination, marginalisation, and neglect
during Saddam Hussein’s regime, in recent years they have experienced increasing persecution
by Sunni extremists [5].
On 3 August 2014, ISIS launched a coordinated attack on Sinjar City and surrounding
towns and villages, forcing Yazidis to seek refuge on Mount Sinjar. Those who could not flee
in time were either killed or kidnapped [6]. As ISIS encircled the mountain on 4 August,
tens of thousands of Yazidis remained trapped without water, food, or shelter in tempera-
tures rising above 50˚C. At the request of the Iraqi government, United States airstrikes and
humanitarian aid airdrops began on 8 August; helicopter rescue missions were initiated a
few days later. Most Yazidis were evacuated between 9–13 August when a safe corridor was
opened by Kurdish forces, allowing them to flee through Syria into the Kurdistan Region of
Iraq [7].
The vast majority of Yazidis reached Kurdistan by mid-August 2014, where they found
temporary shelter in hundreds of informal settlements, including schools, community spaces,
and unfinished buildings. As schools were needed for the beginning of the academic year and
some property owners requested the government to clear their properties, displaced Yazidis
were gradually transferred to newly built camps [8]. More than 300,000 Yazidis have settled in
Kurdistan, with over half in camps managed by the Kurdistan regional government and the
balance still scattered in construction sites and unofficial tented settlements [8,9]. A relatively
low number of Yazidis have settled elsewhere: by 2015, it was estimated that some 10,000
remained in tents on the north side of Mount Sinjar under Kurdish control, nearly 15,000
were reportedly in refugee camps in Syria, and at least 30,000 were known to have crossed into
Turkey [10–12].
Soon after the events of August 2014, the United Nations Human Rights Council dis-
patched a mission to Kurdistan to document the scope of ISIS violations of international

 human rights law. The mission report asserts that “members of ISIS may have perpetrated
genocide against the Yazidi community by killing, causing serious bodily or mental harm and
forcibly transferring members of the group, including children, in the context of a manifest
pattern of conduct aimed at the destruction of the group” and that “further investigation is
needed to establish the precise number of those who continue to be held by ISIS as well as the
numbers killed, estimated to be in the thousands” [13].
Some attempts have been made to compile lists of those affected. Kurdish authorities and
human rights organisations have reported to the United Nations that between 2,000 and 5,500
Yazidis were killed and more than 6,000 were kidnapped; however, the United Nations has
not yet been able to independently verify these figures [14]. Between 4 November and 25
December 2015, we conducted a retrospective household survey to provide the first popula-
tion-based estimates of the number and demographic profile of Yazidis killed and kidnapped
by ISIS.

 Methods
Ethical approval
The study received ethical approval from the Middle East Centre Committee of the London
School of Economics and Political Science, London, United Kingdom and the Ethics Com-
mittee of the Hawler Medical University, Erbil, Kurdistan Region of Iraq. Permission to
conduct the survey was granted by the Kurdish Board of Relief and Humanitarian Affairs,
Dohuk, Kurdistan Region of Iraq. Analysis of the data was declared exempt by the Institu-
tional Review Board of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore,
Maryland, US.
Data collection
The survey covered the displaced Yazidi population from Sinjar residing in camps in the Kur-
distan Region of Iraq. As of December 2015, the Kurdish Board of Relief and Humanitarian
Affairs (BRHA) managed 13 camps—Bajed Kandala, Bardarash, Bersive, Chamisku, Dawdiya,
Essian, Garmawa, Karbato, Khanke, Mamilian, Rwanga, Shariya, and Sheikhan—hosting
about 200,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs) from Nineveh governorate, predominantly
Yazidis. Maps were available for all camps. All shelters (tents or prefabricated caravans) within
camps were numbered.
We selected a stratified systematic random sample of 100 households per camp, yielding a
total of 1,300 households. For each camp (stratum), we determined a sampling interval k as the
ratio of camp size to sample size. We chose a random number from 1 to k to identify a starting
household and selected every kth household thereafter. We defined a household as a group of
people living together in one shelter. By this definition, a household corresponded in most
cases to a nuclear family, but if multiple nuclear families were living in one shelter, they were
still regarded as one household. In all camps, nuclear families with more than six members
were given two adjacent tents or caravans; these nuclear families were regarded as one house-
hold, even though they occupied two shelters.
The questionnaire was designed to gather information about the current household compo-
sition and the age and sex of any household member who was killed or kidnapped by ISIS.
Similar retrospective questionnaires have been used extensively to collect data on violence and
mortality in conflict-affected populations [15–22]. To avoid double counting, respondents
were asked to only report persons killed and kidnapped from their household (i.e., from the
nuclear family or families living in that shelter). The relation to respondent for each reported
household member was recorded. If killings of household members were reported, the circum-
stances of death were queried. Respondents were asked to specify whether the deceased was
executed or died on Mount Sinjar during the ISIS siege. If kidnappings were reported, respon-
dents were asked whether the person had escaped ISIS captivity or was still missing at the time
of the survey. The health status of surviving household members was also queried (the health
section of the survey will be published elsewhere).
The questionnaire was first drafted in English, then translated to Arabic, and then trans-
lated back to English. A focus group was organised at the Hawler Medical University to discuss
major issues in content, translation, and interview flow. We revised the questionnaire based
on the focus group discussion and agreed upon a consensus translation. This version of the
questionnaire was pilot tested in 100 households in Shariya camp a few days before starting the
survey, and final changes were made based on data evaluation and feedback from interviewers.
The field team consisted of four pairs of local Yazidi interviewers (one male and one female)
and one survey supervisor. Before the pilot, the interviewers were given a three-day training

 session concerning the questionnaire, sampling methods, data collection using tablets, inter-
view techniques, and basic protection principles for human subjects.
Fieldwork took place between 4 November and 25 December 2015. Interviews were con-
ducted with the household head or a responsible adult in the household. The interviewers
obtained verbal informed consent from all participants after reading a consent form outlining
the purpose of the survey, its confidentiality, and the voluntary nature of participation. If no
suitable informant was present in the household, an attempt was made to revisit the household
later on the same day. In case of noncontact or refusal to participate, the interviewers were
instructed to conduct an interview with the household living in the nearest tent or caravan. To
protect the anonymity of respondents, no unique identifiers were recorded. Data were col-
lected on tablets using Magpi 2.0. The survey supervisor was responsible for checking ques-
tionnaires for completion and quality before transmitting records from tablets to the Magpi
web account.
Statistical analysis
Data analysis was performed using Stata 14 and R 3.2, applying standard adjustment methods
for unequal probability stratified sampling and a finite population correction factor [23].
Inverse probability weights were used to account for the fact that a sample of the same size was
drawn from each camp but camp sizes varied from 900 to 6,000 shelters. Households occupy-
ing two shelters (i.e., those having more than six members) were reweighted to adjust for the
fact that they had a higher probability of being selected into the survey.
We estimated the probability of being killed or kidnapped by dividing the number of
reports by the number of sampled Yazidis at risk (i.e., excluding those born after the events on
Mount Sinjar). We did not attempt to estimate the daily rate of killings and kidnappings
because the exact timing of events as well as how many Yazidis were at risk at any given
moment is unknown in sufficient detail. To obtain the overall toll of killings and kidnappings,
those probabilities were multiplied by the total Yazidi population living in Sinjar at the time of
the ISIS attack, estimated at roughly 400,000 by the United Nations and Kurdish officials [3,4].
The demographic profile of those killed and kidnapped was examined, distinguishing between
children and adults and females and males. Consistent with previous surveys in Iraq, we
defined children as those under 15 y of age [19–22].
Our estimates are based on the assumption that Yazidis residing in BRHA camps are repre-
sentative of all Yazidis from Sinjar in terms of their exposure to the ISIS attack. We believe this
assumption is reasonable given the somewhat random process through which some families
were transferred from informal settlements (i.e., schools and unfinished buildings that needed
to be vacated) to official camps [8]. There is no indication that in-camp and out-of-camp Yazi-
dis are different in their exposure to the events of August 2014. On the contrary, the United
Nations has provided evidence that the ISIS attack was unexpected and all Yazidis living in
Sinjar were targeted [3]. The uncertainty associated with inference from a sample of in-camp
households must nevertheless be acknowledged. Without a sampling frame, those Yazidis who
were still scattered in informal settlements could not be included in the survey. The relatively
low proportion of Yazidis who have settled elsewhere than in Kurdistan could not be included
either.
Survival bias is a source of concern in this context, as there is evidence that killings and kid-
nappings were clustered within nuclear families. This is because those families who could not
flee in time were generally captured together. Since nuclear families with no survivors had
zero probability of being selected and reported in the survey, the number of killings and kid-
nappings is likely underestimated in our data. How large the downward bias is depends on the

 extent to which killings and kidnappings were clustered within families as well as the distribu-
tion of family sizes in the Yazidi population. The greater the number of families captured
together and the larger those families are, the greater the underestimate.
We conducted a sensitivity analysis to assess what the underestimate of the total number of
killings and kidnappings would be depending on the proportion of zero-survivor families in
the Yazidi population. We simulated 10,000 random samples from a mixture distribution of
family size (ni) and proportion of missing family members (pi), drawing the number of killings
and kidnappings in each ith family from a Binomial(ni, pi) distribution. The distribution of
family sizes was obtained by bootstrapping, whereas the family-specific proportion of killings
and kidnappings was drawn from a Beta(α, β) distribution, where α and β were fitted to the
data using the method of moments. This model accounts for the greater variability (overdis-
persion) in our data, relative to a standard binomial model, because of the clustering of killings
and kidnappings within families [24]. We obtained a sampling distribution of the overall pro-
portion of killings and kidnappings by summing those events in each pseudosample and divid-
ing the total by the number of individuals at risk. We used the number of nuclear families
captured together in which at least one member escaped as a reference group, and we simu-
lated what the toll of killings and kidnappings would be if a similar number of families were
still in captivity or had died in their entirety with no one surviving to report.
Results
Sample characteristics
Of the 1,300 interviewed households in BRHA camps, 988 were Yazidi from Sinjar and 19
were Yazidi from the Nineveh Plain. The rest of the sample consisted of 105 Shabak, 6 Turk-
men, 83 Sunni Kurd, 86 Sunni Arab, and 13 Assyrian Christian households. All households
had been displaced from their homes in Nineveh governorate during the ISIS attack. Ninety-
three of the selected households (7.2%) were replaced with households living in the nearest
shelter because responsible adults were absent (6.5%) or refused to be interviewed (0.7%). The
988 Yazidi households from Sinjar contained 6,572 living residents at the time of the survey.
The other 312 displaced households had 1,788 living residents (Table 1).
Yazidi interviewees from Sinjar reported 43 killings and 83 kidnappings of household
members by ISIS. Twenty-two household members were executed—either shot, beheaded or
burned alive—while 21 died from lack of water and food or injuries during the ISIS siege on
Mount Sinjar. Of the 83 kidnapped, 45 had escaped ISIS captivity by the time of the survey
while 38 were still missing. Killings and kidnappings included children and adults and females
and males (Tables 2 and 3). Among others interviewed, one killing attributed to ISIS was
reported by a Sunni Arab household from the Nineveh Plain and two kidnappings were

an adult male.
Population estimates
Table 4 shows the estimated probabilities of killings and kidnappings of Yazidis by ISIS. Nearly
25 out of 1,000 people were either killed or kidnapped (95% CI 17.5–34.6). The likelihood of
being killed was 7.6 per 1,000 (95% CI 5.3–11.0) and the likelihood of being kidnapped 17.0
per 1,000 (95% CI 10.7–26.9). Fig 2 displays the estimated toll of killings and kidnappings,
assuming a Yazidi population of 400,000 in Sinjar at the time of the ISIS attack. The overall
estimated toll is 9,900 (95% CI 7,000–13,900) people. An estimated 3,100 (95% CI 2,100–
4,400) Yazidis were killed: 1,400 (95% CI 800–2,300) were executed, and 1,700 (95% CI 1,000–
2,900) died on Mount Sinjar during the ISIS siege. The estimated number kidnapped is 6,800
(95% CI 4,200–10,800). At the time of the survey, an estimated 4,300 (95% CI 2,400–7,800)
Yazidis had escaped captivity, while an estimated 2,500 (95% CI 1,100–5,500) were still
missing.

 Killings and kidnappings were highly clustered—6.7% of nuclear families in the sample
accounted for all these events. Of those nuclear families with at least one killing or kidnapping,
13.2% had all members either killed or kidnapped but were reported in the sample because at
least one family member managed to escape ISIS captivity. In other words, nearly 1% of the
nuclear families in our sample were captured in their entirety. Had there been no one to escape
and report their fate, our estimate of the total number of killings and kidnappings would have
been 21.7% lower, suggesting that the potential underestimate is large.
Fig 3 shows the sensitivity of our estimate to the potential number of zero-survivor families.
The proportion of nuclear families in the sample who were captured in their entirety but sub-
sequently had one or more members escape provides a useful point of reference. If an equal
number of nuclear families are still missing, the toll of killings and kidnappings would be
12,900 (95% CI 9,000–17,300). Although the expected toll of killings and kidnappings increases
linearly as a function of the number of zero-survivor families, as expected, the confidence
band surrounding that number tends to widen. Contributing to the rising uncertainty are the
clustering of killings and kidnappings within families and, to a lesser extent, the variation in
family size in the population.

 Figs 4 and 5 outline the age and sex profile of Yazidis killed and kidnapped. At the time of
the ISIS attack, the proportion of children under 15 y within the population was 41.2% (95%
CI 39.6–42.9), and the proportion of females of all ages was 49.4% (95% CI 48.3–50.6). Chil-
dren were disproportionately affected by ISIS violence. They were as likely as adults to be exe-
cuted (95% CI 17.6–62.3) but constituted 93.0% (95% CI 71.9–98.6) of those who died on
Mount Sinjar. Moreover, children only accounted for 18.8% (95% CI 8.4–36.9) of those who
managed to escape captivity. Females were as likely as males to be executed (95% CI 22.7–67.2)
and to die on Mount Sinjar (95% CI 34.6–79.8). They were also as likely to be kidnapped and
still missing (95% CI 34.2–69.9).
Discussion
The Yazidi religious minority of Sinjar was devastated by the ISIS attack of August 2014. We
estimate that 2.5% of the Yazidi population was either killed or kidnapped over the course of
just a few days. Other minority groups in Nineveh governorate were also attacked on the basis
of their religious identities and forced to flee their homes, but the scale of killings and kidnap-
pings was not as high [2,3]. The Yazidis have long faced discrimination in Iraq and in recent
years have experienced increasing persecution by Sunni extremists. In 2007, two Yazidi villages
were completely destroyed in the single most devastating Islamist terror attack since the begin-
ning of sectarian conflict in the country [5].

 While violent deaths in Iraq have been typically concentrated among adult men [19–22,25],
our data show that Yazidis were targeted by ISIS regardless of age and sex. Executions were
indiscriminate, including children and adults and females and males. This finding is con-
firmed by the discoveries of 35 mass graves containing the remains of hundreds of Yazidi men,
women, and children in the Sinjar area that has been taken back from ISIS [26]. Our data
show that nearly all of those who died on Mount Sinjar from starvation, dehydration, or inju-
ries during the ISIS siege were children. This finding is consistent with a UNICEF statement
on 5 August 2014 expressing extreme concern for up to 25,000 children stranded on the
mountain “in dire need of humanitarian aid including drinking water and sanitation services”
[27]. Similar warnings appeared in contemporary news reports [28].
Kidnappings were also indiscriminate. Families in captivity were separated and forcibly
transferred to different locations in ISIS-controlled territory. Escapees recounted the abuses

 they had suffered, including forced religious conversion, torture, and sex slavery. The out-
comes of kidnapping varied. Children under 15 y of age were much less likely to escape captiv-
ity than adults. Several accounts confirm that girls were sold or gifted to ISIS fighters, while
boys were forced to attend ISIS training camps [3,29–31]. It is currently impossible to establish
how many of those still missing are alive.
We estimate that 3,100 (95% CI 2,100–4,400) Yazidis were killed and 6,800 (95% CI 4,200–
10,800) were kidnapped. These figures are aligned with the most recent counts reported to the
United Nations by Kurdish authorities and human rights organisations (i.e., between 2,000
and 5,500 killings and more than 6,000 kidnappings) [14]. The fact that multiple independent
sources arrived at similar estimates increases our confidence in the general findings [32].
Nevertheless, this survey has some limitations that must be acknowledged. First, our esti-
mates are based on a random sample of Yazidi households residing in BRHA camps, assuming
that their exposure to the ISIS attack is representative of the experience of the whole Yazidi
population from Sinjar. This assumption seems reasonable given the unexpected and indis-
criminate nature of the attack and the somewhat random process thought which some of the
displaced Yazidis were transferred from informal settlements to official camps [3,8]. However,
the possibility of a higher or lower proportion of killings and kidnappings among Yazidis who
are still scattered in informal settlements in Kurdistan or among those who have settled else-
where cannot be completely ruled out, and a survey of out-of-camp households cannot be con-
ducted under the present circumstances. Further uncertainty in our estimates is introduced by
the reliance on a rough figure of 400,000 for extrapolation to the Yazidi population of Sinjar at
the time of the attack, as the exact number is unknown [3,4].
We believe that the actual toll of killings and kidnappings may be underestimated in our
data because of survival bias. A retrospective survey requires at least one surviving member to
report killings and kidnappings in the family; hence, it is precisely the families with the largest
number of members killed or still in captivity which are excluded from our sample. Although
the number of zero-survivor families is unknown, it is possible that it is in the vicinity of the
number of families captured together who later escaped, whether in whole or in part. If this is
the case, the overall toll of killings and kidnappings would be higher than our estimate by sev-
eral thousands. New measurement methods need to be developed to address the problem of
survival bias in crisis settings, particularly in contexts where families tend to be targeted as a
whole.
Conclusion
On the occasion of the second anniversary of the August 2014 attack, the United Nations
Human Rights Council has declared that the ISIS violence against Yazidis constitutes a case of
ongoing genocide, calling for a refocus of attention on the rescue, protection, and care of the
Yazidi community and recommending the Security Council to refer the case to the Interna-
tional Criminal Court or an ad hoc tribunal with relevant geographical and temporal jurisdic-
tion [33]. The Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide
defines genocide as “any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in
part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such: (a) killing members of the group;
(b) causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; (c) deliberately inflicting
on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in
part; (d) imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group; (e) forcibly transfer-
ring children of the group to another group” [34]. A United Nations Commission of Inquiry
has recently determined that “ISIS has committed, and is committing, the prohibited acts with
the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, the Yazidis of Sinjar” [3]. Population-based estimates

 from our survey confirm the severity of the ISIS attack against the Yazidis. Combined with
other existing evidence, these estimates can contribute to documenting the full scale of viola-
tions and holding perpetrators accountable for their actions.
