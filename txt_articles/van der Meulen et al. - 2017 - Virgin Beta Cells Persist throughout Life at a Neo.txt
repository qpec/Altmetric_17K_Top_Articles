SUMMARY
Postnatal maintenance or regeneration of pancreatic
beta cells is considered to occur exclusively via the
replication of existing beta cells, but clinically mean-
ingful restoration of human beta cell mass by prolifer-
ation has never been achieved. We discovered a
population of immature beta cells that is present
throughout life and forms from non-beta precursors
at a specialized micro-environment or ‘‘neogenic
niche’’ at the islet periphery. These cells express
insulin, but lack other key beta cell markers, and
are transcriptionally immature, incapable of sensing
glucose, and unable to support calcium influx. They
constitute an intermediate stage in the transdifferen-
tiation of alpha cells to cells that are functionally
indistinguishable from conventional beta cells. We
thus identified a lifelong source of new beta cells at
a specialized site within healthy islets. By comparing
co-existing immature and mature beta cells within
healthy islets, we stand to learn how to mature insu-
lin-expressing cells into functional beta cells.
INTRODUCTION
The insulin deficiency that characterizes type 1 diabetes (T1D)
and type 2 diabetes (T2D) has led to strong interest in processes
that control beta cell mass. The current view is that beta cell
mass is determined by the net effect of islet neogenesis, beta
cell proliferation, and hyperplasia, balanced by dedifferentiation
and beta cell death through apoptosis (Bonner-Weir et al., 2010).
Mice increase beta cell mass by self-replication to compensate
for increased metabolic demand in the context of obesity or
pregnancy (Cox et al., 2016; Parsons et al., 1992), although
beta cell proliferation rates decline sharply with age (Brennand
et al., 2007; Teta et al., 2005). In humans, increases in beta cell
mass in response to similar conditions are modest at best. The
mechanisms responsible for this increase are not fully under-
stood. They have long been considered less reliant on beta cell
replication (Butler et al., 2010), although standard replication
markers may underestimate human beta cell proliferation rates
during postmortem conditions (Sullivan et al., 2015). Regardless,
the existence of progenitors within the pancreas that support the
regeneration of functional beta cells is a highly relevant—but
controversial—topic in diabetes.
Several recent reports demonstrate that forced expression of
lineage-inappropriate transcription factors causes islet cells to
switch identity (Collombat et al., 2007, 2009; Gao et al., 2014;
Papizan et al., 2011; van der Meulen and Huising, 2015), which
has been attributed to the similar chromatin states of alpha
and beta cells (Bramswig et al., 2013). This establishes that
beta cells can arise from non-beta endocrine cells in the islet
via direct transdifferentiation. Indeed, near-complete ablation
of pre-existing beta cells is eventually followed by the restoration
of beta cell mass via transdifferentiation of non-beta endocrine
cells in mice (Chera et al., 2014; Thorel et al., 2010). These
studies provided important proof of principle that insulin inde-
pendence can be regained by transdifferentiation, but have
also led to the notion that it is triggered by severe beta cell abla-
tion and the associated pancreas remodeling (Habener and Sta-
nojevic, 2012).
Instead, we demonstrate here that the islet periphery con-
tains a ‘‘neogenic niche,’’ a privileged microenvironment that
supports lifelong conversion between alpha and beta cells.
This is evident from the presence of a distinct population of
immature beta cells at the islet periphery that does not yet
express the late maturation marker Urocortin3 (Ucn3) (Blum
et al., 2012; van der Meulen and Huising, 2014; van der Meulen
et al., 2012). Similar UCN3-negative beta cells are readily iden-
tifiable in human pancreas of different ages and in donors with
T1D. Ucn3-negative beta cells are transcriptionally immature,
lack cell-surface Glut2, cannot sense glucose, and do not sup-
port calcium influx in response to depolarization. By lineage
tracing, we demonstrate that these Ucn3-negative beta cells
are ‘‘virgin’’ beta cells that represent an intermediate stage in

 the transdifferentiation of alpha cells into mature beta cells. On
the basis of their transcriptional signature and functional re-
sponses within intact islets, we demonstrate that beta cells
that arise from alpha cells at the islet edge are functionally indis-
tinguishable from conventional beta cells. Conversely, we also
observe mature beta cells that adopt an alpha cell fate and
function at the islet edge. We propose that this ongoing plas-
ticity within the neogenic niche can be targeted to regenerate
beta cells.
RESULTS
Ucn3-Negative Immature Beta Cells Persist
throughout Life
Ucn3 is a late maturation marker for primary and stem-cell-der-
ived beta cells (Blum et al., 2012; van der Meulen et al., 2012)
that continued to increase progressively weeks after beta cell
expression of Nkx6-1 and Mafa reached steady state, and coin-
cided with the gradual loss of Mafb from beta cells (Figure 1A)
(Artner et al., 2010). However, Ucn3-negative beta cells persisted
in islets of adult mice (Figure 1B). The fraction of beta cells that did
not yet co-express Ucn3 comprised 15% of all beta cells at post-
natal day 2 before stabilizing at approximately 1%–2% of all
beta cells from 3 weeks to 14 months of age (Figure 1C). Ucn3-
negative beta cells did not reflect proliferating beta cells that
had transiently downregulated Ucn3, as Ki67-postive beta cells
continued to stain for Ucn3 (Figure 1D).
Immature Beta Cells Are Located at the Islet Edge
A striking aspect unique to Ucn3-negative immature beta cells
was their frequent proximity to the islet edge. We therefore quan-
tified the relative position of approximately 17,000 individual islet
cells across hundreds of islets from 23 individual animals across
a range of ages, normalized for islet size (Figure 1E). Identity of
each cell was assigned manually. Most cells were either alpha
or mature beta cells (Figures 1F and 1G). We reserved the desig-
nation of immaturity for only those insulin+ cells where no Ucn3
was detected (Figure 1H) and separately quantified the distribu-
tion of insulin+ beta cells with weak, but detectable, Ucn3 (Ucn3-
low beta cells). We reasoned that the latter cells may reflect
maturing beta cells, or may have resulted from the inherent lim-
itations in quantifying gradual increases in signal intensities
by antibody-based methods, and concluded that the prudent
approach was to account for these cells separately (Figure 1I).
We then compared the normalized cumulative distribution of
each population (Figure 1J). Mature beta and alpha cells distrib-
uted preferentially at the islet core and periphery, respectively,
which recapitulated the characteristic mouse islet architecture
and validated our approach. Both Ucn3-low and Ucn3-negative
beta cells localized peripherally, just internally from alpha cells in
the mouse islet (Figure 1J). When broken down by age, immature
and mature beta cell populations in the first postnatal week
distributed in proximity, but segregated as adult architecture is
established (Shih et al., 2013) (Figure S1).
To confirm these findings independently of staining, we
crossed Ins1-H2b-mCherry (Benner et al., 2014) and Ucn3-
eGFP reporter mice (Figures S2A and S2B). Islets from bitrans-
genic offspring revealed a small population of mCherry single
positive beta cells at the islet periphery, while beta cells in the
rest of the islet were consistently co-positive for eGFP and
mCherry (Figures 2A and 2B; Movie S1).
Ucn3-Negative Beta Cells at the Islet Edge Are ‘‘Virgin’’
Beta Cells
While Ucn3 is an excellent beta cell maturation marker, dediffer-
entiating beta cells also lose Ucn3(Blumet al.,2014;van der Meu-
len et al., 2015). Therefore, Ucn3-negative beta cells at the islet
edge could either be new beta cells or have lost Ucn3 expression
secondary to dedifferentiation. To distinguish between both sce-
narios, we lineage traced mature beta cells by crossing Ucn3-Cre
(Figures S2C–S2F) to the mT/mG reporter mouse that switches
from membrane-tdTomato (mT) to membrane-eGFP (mG) upon
Cre expression (Muzumdar et al., 2007). Ucn3-negative beta cells
at the islet periphery hadnot acquireda green mature beta lineage
label and instead retained mT (Figure 1K). This ruled out that these
were once mature beta cells that dedifferentiated, but is entirely
consistent with the scenario that peripheral Ucn3-negative cells
are ‘‘virgin’’ beta cells that arose from a peripheral non-beta pre-
cursor within the islet.
Expression Profile of the Immature Beta Cells at the
Neogenic Niche
We then purified mCherry-positive immature beta cells and
mCherry/eGFP co-positive mature beta cells (Figure 2C) from
the same islets by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)
(Figure 2D) for transcriptome analysis. Overall, immature and
mature beta cells were more similar to each other than to
non-beta cells from the same islets (Figure 2E) and revealed
no differential expression for 75% of detectable genes (Fig-
ure 2F). The remaining genes contained several clusters that
were selectively enriched in either immature or mature beta
cells (Figure 2G). Ucn3 and several transcription factors associ-
ated with beta cell identity, such as Pdx1, Nkx6-1, Insm1, Mnx1,
Neurod1, Pax6, and Mafa, were enriched in mature beta cells.
(Figure 2H). In contrast, Mafb and Neurog3 were enriched in
immature beta cells (Figure 2H). This was confirmed by immu-
nofluorescence, where a majority of Ucn3-negative immature
beta cells did not yet stain for Mafa and retained Mafb (Figures
2I and 2J). A minority of Ucn3-negative immature beta cells
lacked nuclear Pdx1, but most immature cells already showed
nuclear staining for Nkx6-1 (Figures 2K and 2L). On the basis
of their transcriptome, immature beta cells resembled peri-
and early postnatal time points, while mature beta cells resem-
bled the later postnatal stages (Figure S3).
Ucn3-Negative Beta Cells Are Transcriptionally
Immature
We next addressed if Ucn3-negative beta cells were functional.
We observed significant reductions in immature cells of essen-
tial beta cell genes, including many genes required for glucose-
stimulated insulin secretion, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle,
and oxidative phosphorylation (Figures 3A–3D). In contrast,
key metabolic genes that are either considered ‘‘disallowed’’
or contribute to their regulation (Dhawan et al., 2015; Marti-
nez-Sanchez et al., 2016; Piccand et al., 2014; Pullen and Rut-
ter, 2013) were enriched in immature beta cells (Figure 3E).
Islets were also co-stained for insulin, Ucn3, and G6pc2, which
hydrolyzes glucose-6-phosphate (Pound et al., 2013), or the

 oxidoreductase Ero1lb, which is required for disulfide bond for-
mation in pro-insulin (Zito et al., 2010). Both markers co-labeled
Ucn3-positive mature beta cells and the majority of Ucn3-nega-
tive beta cells did not express G6pc2 or Ero1lb (Figures 3F–3I).
We did not observe G6pc2-negative beta cells with Ucn3, but
detected a minority of Ucn3-positive beta cells without Ero1lb.
This indicates that G6pc2 expression generally preceded
Ero1lb and Ucn3.
Ucn3-Negative Beta Cells Are Functionally Immature
The reduced expression of genes encoding critical insulin secre-
tion components, including Slc2a2, established that Ucn3-nega-
tive beta cells are transcriptionally immature, but did not directly
demonstrate their functional status. We determined that Ucn3-
negative peripheral beta cells lacked cell-surface expression
of the essential Glut2 glucose transporter that is encoded by
Slc2a2 (Figures 4A, 4B, and S4), which suggested they were inca-
pable of sensing glucose. Indeed, glucose uptake experiments in
intact Ins1-H2b-mCherry islets using the fluorescent non-hydro-
lysable glucose analog 6-NBDG revealed rapid glucose uptake
across the entire extracellular and intracellular space of the islet
after 50 min, with the exception of a small number of Ins1-H2b-
mCherry-positive beta cells at the islet periphery (Figures 4C
and 4D; Movie S2).
We next administered the beta cell toxin streptozotocin (STZ;
120 mg/kg on 2 consecutive days), which is taken up specifically
by beta cells in a Glut2-dependent manner, to acutely ablate
beta cells. While STZ treatment kills a large fraction of beta cells,
beta cells that survive STZ treatment dedifferentiate, downregu-
late Ucn3, and are therefore difficult to distinguish from immature
beta cells. We therefore used Ucn3-Cre 3 mT/mG bitransgenic
mice, where immature beta cells would remain Ucn3 lineage
negative (red), while dedifferentiated beta cells remain Ucn3
lineage positive (green) despite the downregulation of Ucn3.
Indeed, STZ treatment killed most mature beta cells, leading to
a collapse in islet architecture with remaining Ucn3 lineage-pos-
itive beta cells downregulating insulin at 48 hr after the second
STZ injection. Ucn3 lineage-negative beta cells, on the other
hand, persisted and continued to show normal insulin expres-
sion (Figure 4E). Citrate controls once again revealed clusters
of Ucn3 lineage-negative immature beta cells at the periphery
of otherwise uniformly Ucn3 lineage-positive islets (Figure 4F).
As the purpose of this experiment was to test the ability of imma-
ture beta cells to resist acute STZ-mediated cell death, we did
not track their fate long term.
As STZ administration in vivo provides only a snapshot of the
islet at the conclusion of the experiment, we applied STZ (5 mM)
ex vivo to Ucn3-eGFP 3 Ins1-H2b-mCherry bitransgenic islets,
while imaging continuously in the presence of the nuclear dead
cell marker Sytox Blue. STZ proceeded to kill all Ucn3-eGFP-
positive beta cells over the course of the 10 hr treatment (Fig-
ure 4G). In contrast, mCherry single positive immature beta cells
are among the last beta cells to take up Sytox Blue (Movie S3).
Collectively, these three experiments demonstrate that imma-
ture beta cells have impaired glucose uptake and are protected
from STZ-mediated beta cell death, in line with their lack of
cell-surface Glut2.
As ATP generated by glycolytic flux triggers beta cell depolar-
ization downstream of Glut2, this experiment did not address
if immature beta cells were capable of supporting voltage-trig-
gered inward calcium currents. We therefore directly recorded
these cells in voltage-clamp mode and observed that immature
beta cells were unable to respond to stepwise depolarization
with the opening of L-type voltage-gated calcium channels (Fig-
ures 4H and 4I).
Immature Beta Cells Are Present in Human Islets
In human neonatal islets, UCN3-negative beta cells preferentially
localize to the interface between clusters of alpha and beta cells
or to the periphery (Figures 5A and 5B). This suggests that a
spatially distinct neogenic niche exists at an early age in human
islets before alpha and beta cells progressively intermingle in
adult human islets, where UCN3-negative beta cells are less
common (Figure 5C). Moreover, we observed residual insulin-
positive, UCN3-negative beta cells in human donors with diag-
nosed T1D (Figures 5D and 5E), although it is impossible to
know without lineage tracing whether these cells reflect regener-
ation of new beta cells or dedifferentiation of existing ones.
Immature Beta Cells Are an Intermediate Stage in Alpha-
to-Beta Transdifferentiation
The location of immature beta cells at the neogenic niche sug-
gested the presence of a local precursor distinct from existing
mature beta cells. This may be a progenitor sensu stricto that is
destined to become a beta cell, or it could be another differenti-
ated cell type that, under the right circumstances, becomes
a beta cell. This led us to hypothesize that the persistent popula-
tion of immature beta cells we discovered reflects an intermedi-
ate stage in the transdifferentiation of alpha to mature beta
cells. We therefore lineage labeled alpha cells using bitransgenic
offspring of a cross between Gcg-Cre (Herrera, 2000) and mT/mG
reporter mice and readily observed cells with an alpha cell lineage
label (green) that expressed Ucn3 instead of glucagon (Fig-
ure 6A). The acquisition of an alpha cell lineage label by beta cells
could reflect an artifact of transgenesis. Under such a stochastic
scenario, one would expect lineage-labeled beta cells to occur
randomly across the cross-sectional area of the islet (Figure 6B).
Alternatively, beta cells may acquire an alpha cell lineage label
if they go through an insulin/glucagon bi-hormonal progenitor
stage during embryonic development. As beta cell mass in-
creases rapidly in early postnatal life by clonal expansion, this
would lead to clusters of clonally related beta cells with an alpha
cell lineage label. Indeed, such a distribution was observed in
adult islets of a Gcg-Cre line that labeled bi-hormonal cells during

 pancreas development (Shiota et al., 2013), but is never observed
in the line we used (Herrera, 2000). However, if beta cells that
carry an alpha cell lineage label reflect transdifferentiation of
alpha to beta cells at the periphery of adult islets, one would
expect that beta cells with an alpha cell lineage label preferentially
co-distribute with alpha cells (Figure 6B). Indeed, we observed
these cells to be peripherally distributed just internally from the
alpha cell population (Figure 6C). Moreover, we occasionally
observed immature beta cells with an alpha cell lineage label
that did not yet co-express Ucn3 at the islet edge (Figure 6D).
Nevertheless, to more firmly establish that alpha-to-beta transdif-
ferentiation takes place in adult islets at the neogenic niche, we
used Gcg-CreER 3 lsl-eYFP bitransgenic reporter mice (Acker-
mann et al., 2017) in a pulse-chase approach to lineage label all
alpha cells at 2 monthsof age. Two days after the lineage labeling,
the fraction of beta cells with an alpha cell lineage label was
<0.2%, but this fraction had increased significantly4 months after
tamoxifen (Figures 6E and 6F). This is consistent with a scenario
where alpha cells transdifferentiate via a transient, immature
stage that expresses insulin, but not Ucn3. Interestingly, the total
fraction of glucagon-positive cells that carries an alpha cell line-
age label also dropped from nearly 100% to slightly less than
97% over the same period (Figure 6G), suggesting that new alpha
cells arose from a non-alpha source during the same window.
Based on the absence of mT/mG co-positive ‘‘yellow’’ cells in
the pancreas of bitransgenic Ins1-Cre 3 Isl-mT/mG reporter
mice, it had previously been concluded that there was no post-
natal contribution of non-beta cells to the beta cell mass (Xiao
et al., 2013), a conclusion that appears to contradict our current
observations. However, beta cells are only yellow (i.e., mT/mG
co-positive) for a short, 4-day window after activation of Ins1-
CreER with a single tamoxifen pulse (Figure S5). Moreover, this
study attempted to detect this transient ‘‘yellow’’ intermediate
stage in dissociated whole pancreas (which consists of >98%
non-islet cells) and was by design underpowered to detect a
relatively small but ongoing contribution of non-beta cells to
the beta cell mass. By using isolated islets and a constitutive
Cre to accumulate transdifferentiation events, we achieved
markedly better sensitivity.
Beta Cells of Alpha Cell Descent Are Transcriptionally
Similar to Conventional Beta Cells
We compared the transcriptomes of beta cells of alpha cell
descent with conventional beta cells from the same islets, using
Ins1-H2b-mCherry mice crossed to Gcg-Cre and lsl-YFP mice
(DiGruccio et al., 2016). In this strategy, alpha cells that transdif-
ferentiated into beta cells acquired mCherry, but maintained
the YFP lineage label and can be FACS sorted accordingly
(Figures 6H and 6I; Movie S4). We applied a stringent doublet
exclusion strategy to ensure that the 0.3% mCherry/YFP
co-positive events did not reflect doublets. We validated this
by imaging cytometry and confirmed that transdifferentiated
cells expressed mRNA for both mCherry and Yfp (Figure S6).
Approximately 81% of all detectable genes were shared by all
three cell populations. The remaining 19% of detectable genes
were split between alpha and beta cells. Less than 1% of all
genes were enriched in transdifferentiated cells (Figure 6J).
This is relevant, as these genes may contain markers to identify
beta cells from alpha cell descent in human islets, where lineage
tracing is not possible. Transdifferentiated cells more closely
resembled beta cells, but clustered intermediate from the alpha
cells that they once were and the beta cells that they became
(Figures 6K and 6L).
Beta Cells that Arise via Transdifferentiation from Alpha
Cells Are Functionally Mature
To determine whether transdifferentiation from alpha cells at
the neogenic niche generates functionally mature beta cells,
we assessed their ability to respond to glucose stimulation us-
ing a floxed allele of the genetically encoded calcium indicator
GCaMP6. This strategy served the dual purpose of a traditional
Cre-dependent lineage-labeling approach with the ability to
dynamically record the behavior of the lineage-labeled cells
within intact islets in real time. We conducted these experi-
ments on the Ins1-H2b-mCherry background to distinguish
beta from non-beta cells. We first established the prototypical
responses of alpha and beta cells to known alpha and beta
cell-selective cues. To selectively stimulate alpha cells, we
applied the peptide hormone AVP, which activates V1b recep-
tors that are selectively expressed by alpha cells (DiGruccio
et al., 2016) (Figure 7A), and dose-dependently stimulated
glucagon release (Dunning et al., 1984) (Figure 7B). Alpha cells
within intact islets responded simultaneously with a calcium
response to the initial application of each escalating dose of
AVP, which was followed by a period of uncoordinated, alpha
cell-autonomous calcium activity (Figure 7C; Movie S5). To
selectively stimulate beta cells, we continuously perfused with
16.8 mM glucose, which activated a pulsatile, synchronized
calcium response uniquely characteristic of healthy beta cells
(Figure 7D; Movie S5). To establish the functional responses
of transdifferentiated cells at the neogenic niche, we used
Gcg-Cre to lineage label alpha cells with GCaMP6. As before,

 AVP stimulated an alpha cell-autonomous response. However,
upon switching to 16.8 mM glucose, a new population of cells at
the islet surface that had not responded to AVP now started
firing in the synchronized, pulsatile fashion that is characteristic
of functionally mature beta cells (Figure 7E; Movie S6). While
their GCaMP6 expression indicated alpha cell lineage history,
their functional behavior and Ins1-dependent expression of
nuclear mCherry each confirmed current beta cell identity;
AVP-responsive alpha cells maintained a dark nuclear shade
(Figures 7E and 7F). A brief depolarization (30 mM KCl) acti-
vated all GCaMP6-expressing cells, regardless of current iden-
tity to indicate cell viability throughout the experiment.
Mature Beta Cells Transdifferentiate into Alpha Cells at
the Islet Edge
Our findings thus far raised the question of whether the privileged
micro-environment of the neogenic niche specifically supports
the conversion of alpha cells into beta cells, or supports lineage
plasticity in general. The observation that new lineage-negative
alpha cells appeared during the 4 months following the tamox-
ifen-induced labeling of the entire alpha cells (Figure 6G) sug-
gests that new alpha cells are continuously generated from a
non-alpha progenitor. Indeed, when we used Ucn3-Cre to line-
age label mature beta cells, we observed Ucn3 lineage-labeled
cells at the islet edge that expressed glucagon instead of Ucn3
(Figure 7G). To determine if such alpha cells of mature beta
descent fully completed their transdifferentiation, islets from
Ins1-H2b-mCherry mice that expressed GCaMP6 in the alpha
(Gcg-Cre) or mature beta lineage (Ucn3-Cre) were simulta-
neously subjected to the same set of alpha and beta cell-specific
stimuli as before (Movie S7). We readily identified Ucn3 lineage-
labeled GCaMP6-positive cells that nevertheless responded
in typical alpha cell fashion to AVP under basal glucose condi-
tions and were indistinguishable from conventional Gcg-Cre-ex-
pressing alpha cells in the adjacent islet (Figure 7H). These cells
no longer participated in the synchronized, pulsatile calcium

 response following subsequent stimulation with 16.8 mM
glucose, which implies that they were no longer coupled to
the beta cell mass via gap junctions. They also no longer had
an mCherry+ nucleus, but responded robustly to depolarization
by KCl (Figures 7H and 7I). This established that alpha cells can
transdifferentiate from mature beta cells at the edge of healthy
islets.
DISCUSSION
Here we describe a population of Ucn3-negative beta cells that
occurs throughout life at a spatially distinct ‘‘neogenic niche’’ at
the islet periphery. These cells express insulin, but are transcrip-
tionally immature and lack key beta cell markers such as G6pc2,
Ero1lb, and cell-surface Glut2. Indeed, these beta cells do not
sense glucose and cannot support calcium influx following
depolarization, indicating that they are functionally immature.
They represent virgin beta cells that constitute a transitional
stage in the transdifferentiation from alpha into mature, func-
tional beta cells. We also observe the converse transition from
mature beta into functional alpha cells. Based on the totality
of these observations, we propose that the islet periphery con-
tains a specialized neogenic niche: a specific micro-environ-
ment where the necessary cues and conditions to facilitate islet
cell plasticity are met. The differentiation of pancreatic beta cells
during embryonic development is driven by spatiotemporal gra-
dients that determine the formation of endocrine progenitors at
the trunk of the budding ducts followed by their delamination
from the ductal epithelia to eventually cluster into islets (Shih
et al., 2013). Our discovery suggests the continued importance
of the 3D environment in determining the plasticity and mainte-
nance of islet cell fate.
The continuous formation of new beta cells from a progenitor
pool in adult islets is a distinct departure from the long-standing
paradigm that maintenance of beta cell mass occurs exclusively
through beta cell self-replication (Brennand et al., 2007; Dor
et al., 2004). However, since the latter study was conducted us-
ing a low-efficiency (30%) lineage-labeling strategy dependent
on the rat insulin promoter, it was underpowered to rule out a
relatively small contribution from non-beta cells. Moreover, this
strategy could not have differentiated between the immature
and mature beta cells we report here, for both express insulin.
Our observations are easily reconciled with the common view
that beta cell self-renewal is the major mechanism to regenerate
or expand beta cell mass in mice, provided sufficient beta cells
remain (Cox et al., 2016). Our discovery of the neogenic niche ex-
tends this model to establish that beta cells can and do arise via
alternative paths within islets of healthy, non-diabetic individ-
uals. This is particularly relevant to established T1D, where pro-
liferation of any residual beta cells by itself is unlikely to support
meaningful regeneration of functional beta cell mass, given
that human beta cells rarely proliferate (Meier et al., 2008). This
emphasizes the need to pursue alternative beta cell sources to
restore functional beta cell mass.
Transdifferentiation from alpha to beta cells without genetic
perturbation of transcriptionfactor expression was first described
following near-complete beta cell ablation in mice (Thorel et al.,
2010). The process is commonly presumed to be induced by
insulin deficiency or pancreatic injury and remodeling (Chera
et al., 2014; Habener and Stanojevic, 2012). Instead, our observa-
tions demonstrate that transdifferentiation between alpha and
beta cells takes place within a specialized niche at the periphery
of healthy islets. It follows that the near-complete removal of
existing beta cells as the predominant source of beta cell regen-
eration may have merely unmasked transdifferentiation as an
alternate contributor to beta cell regeneration. This represents
an important conceptual shift: it suggests that the signal(s) that
control plasticity at the neogenic niche are associated with the
constellation of cell types and autonomic nerves that converge
at the periphery of healthy islets instead of being induced in
response to major pancreas remodeling. Of course, this does
not rule out a scenario in which transdifferentiation is further

development is predicted to lead to randomly localized clusters of lineage-labeled beta cells that expanded from a single bi-hormonal progenitor, and
(3) transdifferentiation of alpha cells into beta cells at the periphery of adult islets. See also Figure S5.

 stimulated under certain (patho)physiological circumstances, as
was recently demonstrated when blockade of glucagon-depen-
dent amino acid clearance by the liver promoted alpha cell prolif-
eration, accompanied by increased alpha-to-beta transdifferen-
tiation (Solloway et al., 2015).
Islet architecture differs markedly between adult human and
mouse islets (Brissova et al., 2005; Cabrera et al., 2006; Do-
len�
sek et al., 2015; Kim et al., 2009). However, in younger human
donor islets, alpha and beta cells segregate into distinct areas or
adopt a mantle/core topology similar to mouse islets (Figure 5).
We readily observe UCN3-negative beta cells at the alpha/beta
interface in islets of neonatal and infant pancreas donors and
can also identify such cells in adult human pancreas. This sug-
gests that a neogenic niche similar to the one we discovered in
mice may exist in human islets, at least in younger ages. More-
over, we continue to observe UCN3-negative beta cells within
islets of patients with decades-long histories of T1D, possibly
reflecting subclinical beta cell regeneration supported by the
islet plasticity we describe here. However, human islet architec-
ture becomes less defined with age and Ucn3 expression is lost
from beta cells in diabetes (Blum et al., 2014; van der Meulen
et al., 2015). The fact that a lack of Ucn3 marks both immature
and dedifferentiated beta cells complicates its utility as a marker
to establish whether immature beta cells continue to congregate
in a spatially distinct niche. Nevertheless, our observations could
indicate human alpha cell-autonomous potential to adopt a beta
cell identity that may be re-engaged by recreating the appro-
priate conditions that converge at the neogenic niche.
Our discovery that a population of immature beta cells persists
in the islets of healthy adult mice and, possibly, humans is also a
strong testament to the significant heterogeneity that has long
been known among beta cells (Giordano et al., 1991; Kiekens
et al., 1992). Insulin-expressing pancreatic multipotent progeni-
tor cells (PMPCs) were reported that are capable of extensive
self-replication and self-renewal and contribute to multiple
pancreatic and neural cell types (Smukler et al., 2011). These
and similar cells found in small clusters outside of normal islets
(Beamish et al., 2016) share a lack of cell-surface Glut2 with the
immature beta cells we discovered at the niche. However, the
genes enriched in the PMPC transcriptome (Razavi et al., 2015)
demonstrate virtually no overlap with those enriched in immature
beta cells (Figure S4). Moreover, while we consider Ucn3-nega-
tive immature beta cells to be a reservoir of beta cell progenitors,
we do not have evidence to suggest that they possess the multi-
potent progenitor properties described for PMPCs. Recently, a
distinct population of approximately 15% of all beta cells was
described to resist immune attack in non-obese diabetic (NOD)
mice. These beta cells are characterized by reduced expression
of beta cell identity genes including Slc2a2 and likely reflect the
dedifferentiation of existing beta cells (Rui et al., 2017). While
these cells are distinct from the virgin beta cells that we describe,
these observations nevertheless suggest that immature beta
cells by virtue of their reduced expression of beta cell identity
genes—including the major auto-antigens insulin and G6pc2—
may escape auto-immune diabetes similar to their resistance to
STZ-mediated beta cell death.
Other recent papers describe a distinct population of beta
‘‘hub’’ cells that control theresponse of islets to stimulation (John-
ston et al.,2016) or report heterogeneity based on a transgenicre-
porter strain for Flattop (Bader et al., 2016). However, based on
several lines of evidence, it is clear that the Ucn3-negative imma-
ture beta cells we discovered are completely distinct from both.
Flattop-negative beta cells constitute approximately 20% of the
total beta cell mass and hub cells make up 5%–10% of the
beta cells, with both beta cell types found throughout the islet
(Figure S4). This contrasts with the 1.5% of beta cell number
and the peripheral location of Ucn3-negative immature beta cells.
Moreover, Flattop-positive and negative beta cells both robustly
express Ucn3 protein (Bader et al., 2016), and vice versa, Ucn3-
negative immature and Ucn3-expressing mature beta cells
express similar levels of Flattop mRNA (Figure S4), indicating
that Flattop and Ucn3 do not mark the same beta cell population.
In human islets, four sub-populations of beta cells were recently
described based on the expression of ST8SIA1 and CD9 (Dorrell
et al., 2016). ST8SIA1-positive cells share traits with the imma-
ture beta cells we describe here (Figure S4), although others
(including ST8SIA1 itself) are distinct between these beta cell
sub-populations.
In summary, the plasticity of beta cell identity is a double-
edged sword that provides an opportunity to regenerate beta
cells from endogenous progenitors, while contributing to their
dedifferentiation in diabetes (Jonas et al., 1999; Talchai et al.,
2012). The lessons we learn from beta cell maturation at the neo-
genic niche will be widely applicable under different scenarios in
which beta cell maturity is either desired or compromised. This
includes the generation of functionally mature human beta cells
from stem cells to alleviate the pressing need for an unlimited
source of human beta cells to cure T1D—a feat that, despite

 impressive recent progress in the field (Pagliuca et al., 2014; Re-
zania et al., 2014; Russ et al., 2015), has not been achieved. We
envision that the signaling responses and epigenetic mecha-
nisms that underlie beta cell maturation at the niche overlap
with those that are impaired when beta cells dedifferentiate in
diabetes. It follows that the discovery of the specific spatiotem-
poral cues that govern islet cell fate at the neogenic niche can be
wielded to take advantage of the significant plasticity in beta cell
regeneration. These insights could apply to generate functionally
mature beta cells from endogenous sources or stem cell-derived
progenitors and to block the adverse consequences of the beta
cell identity crisis in diabetes.

 EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Animals
Commercial male C57BL6/NHsd mice were obtained from Harlan (Indianapolis, IN; now Envigo) at 3, 6 and 9 weeks and 3, 8
and 14 months of age and used immediately for pancreas collection. A number of transgenic mouse lines were employed.
The dual color lsl-mT/mG reporter mouse (Gt(ROSA)26Sortm4(ACTB-tdTomato,-eGFP)Luo/J, JAX strain 007576) (Muzumdar et al.,
2007). The lsl-eYFP reporter mouse (B6.129X1-Gt(ROSA)26Sortm1(EYFP)Cos/J) (Srinivas et al., 2001). Calcium levels in the
cell were visualized using the lsl-GCaMP6 mouse line (B6;129S6-Gt(ROSA)26Sortm96(CAG-GCaMP6s)Hze/J) (Madisen et al.,
2015). Two Ucn3 BAC transgenic reporter mice were used that are based on BAC clone RP23-332L13, which contains the
Ucn3 gene flanked by more than 197 kb of genomic context: the Ucn3-Cre line (B6.FVB(Cg)-Tg(Ucn3-cre)KF43Gsat/Mmucd
and the Ucn3-eGFP line (Tg(Ucn3-eGFP)HY36Gsat/Mmucd). For alpha cell labeling we employed a Gcg-Cre mouse line
(Herrera, 2000) or a Gcg-CreER line (Ackermann et al., 2017). To label beta cells we used the B6.Cg-Tg(Ins1-HIST1H2BB/
mCherry)5091Mhsg/J mouse line (Benner et al., 2014). To lineage label beta cells in Figure S6, we used the Ins1-CreER mouse
line (B6.Cg-Tg(Ins1-cre/ERT)1Lphi/J) (Wicksteed et al., 2010). All transgenic lines are maintained by backcrossing to commer-
cially obtained C57BL6/NHsd (Envigo). Unless indicated otherwise, adult mice of both sexes were used between 3 and 9 months
of age. Animals were maintained in group-housing on a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle with free access to water and standard rodent
chow. All animal procedures were approved by the Salk Institute for Biological Studies and UC Davis Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committees and performed in compliance with the Animal Welfare Act and the ILAR Guide to the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals.
Validation of novel transgenic mouse models
We observed close overlap between the expression of Ucn3 peptide and the expression of GFP in the Ucn3-eGFP mouse line
Tg(Ucn3-eGFP)HY36Gsat/Mmucd (Figure S2). We evaluated two distinct Ucn3-Cre lines and validated the Ucn3-Cre(KF43) line to
selectively and specifically label the Ucn3 expression domain in within the islets (Figure S2). In this line, over 98% of all insulin-positive
beta cells in bitransgenic offspring from the Ucn3-Cre x mT/mG cross carries the mG lineage-label, validating this reporter line. We
also tested the B6.FVB(Cg)-Tg(Ucn3-cre)KF31Gsat/Mmucd) line, but found the efficiency and specificity of this line to be undesirable
(Figure S2).
Primary cell cultures
Primary islets were cultured in RPMI (5.5 mM glucose, 10% FBS, pen/strep) under 5% CO2 at 37�C in 10 cm petri dishes (i.e.
not tissue culture treated). Islets for microscopy or dissociated islet cells for electrophysiology experiments were cultured over-
night on uncoated #1.5 glass-bottom 35 mM culture dishes (MatTek Corporation, Ashland, MA). No cell lines were used in
this study.
Human Subjects
Human donor pancreata were obtained via the Network of Pancreatic Islet Donors with Diabetes (nPOD). Gender and age are indi-

study exempt from IRB review under 45 CFR 46.101 (b) Category (4) on December 11, 2014.
METHOD DETAILS
Islet isolation
Islets were isolated by injecting collagenaseP (0.8 mg/mL in HBSS; Roche Diagnostics) (Invitrogen) via the common bile duct while
the ampulla of Vater was clamped (Huising et al., 2010). The entire pancreas was collected following the injection of 2mL collagenase
solution and, after addition of 2 more ml of collagenase solution, was incubated at 37�C for 13 min. Pancreata were dissociated by
gentle manual shaking followed by three washes with cold HBSS containing 5% NCS. The digested suspension was passed through
a nylon mesh (pore size 425 mm; Small Parts), and islets were isolated by density gradient centrifugation on a Histopaque gradient
(1.077 g/mL density; Sigma) for 20 min at 1400 3 g without brake. Islets were collected from the interface, washed once with cold
HBSS containing 5% NCS, and hand-picked several times under a dissecting microscope prior to culture in RPMI (5.5 mM glucose,
10% FBS, pen/strep).
Flow and imaging cytometry
Islets were dissociated by incubation in 0.25% trypsin/EDTA for 2 min complemented by gentle trituration with a p200 pipette,
washed once in RPMI (5.5 mM glucose, 10% FBS, pen/strep) and immediately processed on the cytometer. Conventional FACS sep-
aration was conducted based on red and green fluorescence, using 1 mg/ml Dapi for live/dead exclusion, as previously described
(DiGruccio et al., 2016; van der Meulen et al., 2015) and samples were collected directly in Trizol reagent for library preparation. Sam-
ples for imaging cytometry were run on an Amnis Imagestream MarkII imaging cytometer (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA) at the Glad-
stone Institutes in San Francisco.

 Next generation sequencing
FACS-sorted samples were collected directly into Trizol reagent. RNA isolation and library construction was done by Illumina’s
TruSeq RNA sample Prep Kit v2 (Illumina Inc. San Diego, CA), sequenced at 50 cycles, and single read on an Illumina HiSeq 2000
platform as previously described (DiGruccio et al., 2016).
Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry was conducted as follows: slides were washed 3 times for 5 min each in KPBS, antibodies were diluted in
KPBS supplemented with 2% donkey serum and 0.4% Triton X-100 and applied overnight at 4�C. After 3 more washes in KPBS,
slides were incubated with secondary antibodies (obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch (Westgrove, PA) and used at 1:600 final
dilution), also in donkey block, now for 45 min at room temperature. Three more washes completed the procedure. Where applicable,
nuclei were counterstained by Dapi at 1 mg/ml final concentration and slides were embedded in Prolong Gold Antifade (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Waltham, MA) and imaged on either a Zeiss LSM780 confocal microscope or a Nikon A1R+ confocal microscope. The
antiserum for Ero1lb (Zito et al., 2010) was generously provided by Dr. David Ron, the antiserum for G6pc2 (Hutton and Eisenbarth,
2003) was originally generated by the late Dr. John Hutton and generously provided by Drs. Jay Walters and Howard Davidson, and
the antiserum for Nkx6-1 was a generous gift from Dr. Maike Sander (Henseleit et al., 2005).
Glucose uptake
To measure glucose uptake, we incubated intact islets from freshly isolated Ins1-H2b-mCherry reporter mice overnight on uncoated
#1.5 glass-bottom 35 mM culture dishes (MatTek Corporation, Ashland, MA) in RPMI (10% FBS, 5.5 mM glucose, pen/strep). The
next day, Z stacks of islets were continuously acquired as the non-hydrolysable glucose analog 6-NBDG (6-(N-(7-Nitrobenz-2-
oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino)-6-Deoxyglucose; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) was added at a final concentration of
0.3 mM, using a Nikon A1R+ confocal microscope in resonant scanning mode. The relative rate of glucose uptake was determined
by drawing ROIs of individual Ins1-H2b-mCherry+ beta cells that either had or had not taken up glucose.
Streptozotocin treatment
Ucn3-Cre x mTmG mice were treated with two doses of 120 mg/kg of streptozotocin (EMD Millipore, Billerica MA) dissolved fresh in
100 mM sodium citrate (pH 4.5) on consecutive days. Citrate controls were included and animals were monitored closely around the
clock to prevent hypoglycemia from STZ-induced insulin release. Mice were euthanized 48 hr after the second STZ injection when
hyperglycemia indicated the destruction of most beta cells and processed for immunohistochemistry. To study streptozotocin-
induced beta cell death ex vivo, we cultured Ins1-H2b-mCherry x Ucn3-eGFP bitransgenic islets as described above and followed
them for 15 hr in the presence of 5 mM STZ and the nuclear dead cell marker Sytox Blue (500 nM, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham,
MA) while acquiring a Z stack every 30 min on a Nikon A1R+ confocal microscope in resonant scanning mode.
Pulse-chase of Gcg-CreER mice
Gcg-CreER x lsl-eYFP bitransgenic mice were treated at 2 months of age with tamoxifen (100 mg/g BW) 3 times over the course of
5 days and collected 2 days (pulse) or 4 months (chase) after the last injection. These samples were embedded in paraffin and a GFP
antiserum was used to detect eYFP protein following antigen retrieval by microwave in 10 mM sodium citrate pH 6.0.
Electrophysiology
Dispersed immature and mature beta cells from Ins1-H2b-mCherry x Ucn3-eGFP bitransgenic islets were patched in the whole cell
configuration and held at �70 mV. All cells were subjected to the voltage clamp protocol depicted in Figure 4H. Recordings were
performed using the following internal solution: (mM) Cs-aspartate 87, CsCl 20, MgCl2 1, MgATP 5, HEPES 10 pH 7.2, EGTA 10
and external solution: (mM) NaCl 138, KCl 5.4, MgCl2 1, CaCl2 10, HEPES 10 pH 7.4, glucose 2.8. Glass capillary electrodes (Suttter
Instruments) were pulled to have a resistance of 7-12 MU. All electrical signals were acquired using a HEKA EPC 10 USB dual head
stage amplifier. Each head stage was mounted on a single Sutter micromanipulator driven by the MPC 225 controller. All cells were
visualized using a Zeiss Axiovert inverted microscope with 10x, 40x and 63x objectives with filters for blue, GFP, YFP, and red fluo-
rophores. The scope was mounted upon a Siskiyou x y translator bolted to a TMC anti-vibration table. All islet cells were continuously
perfused with external solution maintained at 33�C via a stage mounted incubation system. Temperature control was achieved with a
SF-20 in line heater (Harvard Apparatus). Data was acquired using HEKA Patchmaster software version 2x90.2. Signal data was
analyzed using Clampfit 10 (Molecular devices).
Glucagon secretion
Static glucagon secretion experiments were carried out on 30 wild-type mouse islets per well in Krebs Ringer Buffer (KRB). Islets
were isolated the day prior to the secretion assay, cultured overnight in RPMI (5.5 mM glucose, 10% FBS, pen/strep) and transferred
to KRB containing 5.5 mM glucose an hour before the start of the assay. Islets were picked to the wells plate for final secretion in 10%
of the final assay volume. The remaining 90% of volume consisted of KRB without glucose, with the indicated concentration of AVP
added, to effectively reduce the final glucose concentration to 0.5 mM at the start of the secretion assay. AVP peptide was synthe-
sized in-house and generously provided by Dr. Jean Rivier (Salk Institute).

 Calcium responses in intact islets
We used islets from a triple transgenic offspring of a cross between Ins1-H2b-mCherry, lsl-GCaMP6 and either Gcg-Cre or Ucn3-Cre
to label the alpha or mature beta cell lineages, respectively. Live islets were cultured overnight after the islet prep, placed on 35mm
dishes with glass bottom (#1.5; MatTek Corporation), allowed to attach overnight and imaged in x, y, z and t on a Nikon A1R+ confocal
microscope using a 40x lens with a long working distance. Treatments were continuously perfused over the islets using a Masterflex
peristaltic pump at 2.5 mL per minute. Each protocol concluded with a 30 mM potassium chloride pulse to demonstrate viability and
responsiveness throughout the treatment. Individual cells in individual z-planes were defined as regions of interest (ROI) and the
green fluorescence intensity within the ROIs was plotted over time as a measure of calcium activity.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Bio-informatics analysis
Read refinement for quality and adaptor contamination was performed using FASTQC, Scythe, and Sickle. After quality control and
filtering, the libraries comparing immature to mature beta cells had an average library size of 21.4 million reads. The libraries
comparing alpha and beta cells to beta cells of alpha cell-descent had an average library size of 19.2 million reads. The libraries
of the postnatal maturation time series had an average library size of 12.8 million reads. Libraries were then aligned to mouse genome
version GenCode M8 (GRCm38.p4 M8; mm10) using STAR (Dobin et al., 2013) with the two-pass method with default parameters,
with the exception of a tighter mismatch restriction of no greater than 3% per read. Average unique read alignment was 87.5%,
86.6% and 86.9% for the three sets of libraries, respectively. Bigwigs were generated using the wiggle output option in STAR and
Genome Utilities in the UCSC Genome Browser (Kent et al., 2002). Gene-level quantification was performed on sorted BAM files us-
ing featureCounts (Liao et al., 2014) with default parameters, counted by Gencode defined exons, and aggregated to the gene level.
Differential expression analyses were performed using the edgeR generalized linear model approach and maximum likelihood
method testing (Robinson et al., 2010). Results were filtered for statistical significance using the thresholds: FDR < 0.001 and an ab-
solute log2FC > 1 across all experiments. In comparing immature and mature beta cells from adult islets, we observed 3394 differ-
entially expressed genes (2117 Immature enriched, 1277 Mature enriched) that met these thresholds. Using the same criteria, we
observed 2480 genes to be differentially expressed between any of the pairwise comparisons in comparing alpha and beta cells
with trans-differentiated cells. Heatmaps were generated based on the n most up- and n most downregulated genes between
each pairwise comparison, with duplicate genes removed, where n = 750 for Figure 2G and n = 200 for Figure 6K. To enable the
most direct comparison, the same analysis pipeline—from raw sequencing reads, to quantification and differential analyses—
was also applied to compare our data against mouse PMPs (Razavi et al., 2015) and human beta cell subtypes (Dorrell et al.,
2016). Distance matrices for the latter comparison were generated using the R package lattice, with RPKM values from each exper-
iment used to correlate relatedness.
Bio-informatics visualization
All clustering and heatmap visuals were generated using Gene Cluster 3.0 (de Hoon et al., 2004) on log transformed RPKM values
normalized by the median and hierarchically clustered by the city block distance method. The R-package ComplexHeatmap
(Gu et al., 2016) was used on the clustering output using default parameters, with the exception of the maturation time series exper-
iment where the Pearson instead of the Euclidean distance method was used. All Venn diagrams were generated using the R library
package VennDiagram (Chen and Boutros, 2011), using the edgeR output and our FDR and log2FC filtering criteria for gene selection.
We included a lower RPKM threshold of 1 when comparing our immature beta cell transcriptomes with those of the PMPs (Razavi
et al., 2015). KEGG gene set enrichment testing was performed on the immature beta dataset using the R Bioconductor package
GAGE (Luo et al., 2009) on the edgeR output that met the statistical threshold. Pathway visuals were created using the R-package
Pathview (Luo and Brouwer, 2013).
Distribution algorithm
The distribution algorithm we developed to quantify the distribution of cell types across the cross-sectional surface of the islet is build
up into three main parts: segmentation, classification, and distribution measurement. All classification was done manually for each
cell by a person. The segmentation and the distribution measurements are handled using two separate MATLAB functions that inter-
face with Bitplane’s Imaris software. We utilized Imaris in this process to provide an accurate visual representation of the segmen-
tations for verification and classification. After loading the dataset into Imaris and converting the data to 32-bit float, the segmentation
function is called in to segment the islet volume and nuclear volumes separately using a simple intensity based threshold for binary
segmentation. The user is prompted to input which channel(s) should be used for each of these segmentation steps. The segmen-
tation function then creates two surface objects in Imaris, one for the islet sub volume and the second for the nuclei. Both the islet and
nuclei surface objects are visually verified for accuracy, followed by the manual classification of each individual cell into distinct bins
by cell type. Once the classification is complete, the distribution measurement function is called to find the distributions of each clas-
sified group created by the researcher. The distribution measurement function creates a new channel that is the distance transfor-
mation with respect to the interior edge of the islet. The distance transformation channel intensity is then recorded at the center of
each classified nucleus. Recorded measurements are written to a csv file containing all measurements along with the sample
information.

 Statistical Analysis
Data were analyzed by t test, corrected for multiple comparisons using the Holm-Sidak method where appropriate. The distribution of
cells across the islet was tested using a non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test using Dunn’s multiple comparisons test. A post hoc Kol-
mogorov-Smirnov test was conducted to compute the D statistic on the basis of the cumulative frequency distributions computed
from raw data. Data are represented as mean ± SEM across, with n defined in the corresponding figure legend. Differences were
considered significant when p < 0.05. Statistics were computed using Prism (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA).
