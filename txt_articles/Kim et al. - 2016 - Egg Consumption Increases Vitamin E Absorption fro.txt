Abstract
Background: Most people living in the United States underconsume vitamin E, and dietary approaches to increase the
absorption of vitamin E may help individuals to meet their body�s needs.
Objective: We assessed the effect of adding cooked whole egg to a raw mixed-vegetable salad on a-tocopherol and
g-tocopherol absorption.
Methods: With the use of a randomized-crossover design, 16 healthy young men [mean 6 SD age: 24 6 4 y; mean 6 SD
body mass index (in kg/m2): 24 6 2] consumed the same salad (all served with 3 g canola oil) with no egg [control (CON)], with
75 g cooked egg [low egg (LE)], or with 150 g cooked egg [high egg (HE)]; a 1-wk dietary washout period was included between
trials. For the first 7 d of each trial, participants consumed a low–vitamin E diet to reduce plasma vitamin E concentrations.
Blood was collected hourly for 10 h and the triacylglycerol-rich lipoprotein fractions (TRLs) were isolated. a-Tocopherol and
g-tocopherol concentrations in TRLs were analyzed and composite areas under the curve (AUCs) were calculated.
Results: The a-tocopherol 0- to 10-h AUCs (AUCs0–10 h) in TRLs was higher (P < 0.05) for the HE trial (least-squares
mean 6 SE: 981 6 162 nmol/L � 10 h) than for the LE (311 6 162 nmol/L � 10 h) and CON (117 6 162 nmol/L �10 h) trials,
which did not differ from one another. The g-tocopherol AUCs0–10 h in TRLs was also higher (P < 0.05) for the HE trial (402 6
54 nmol/L � 10 h) than for the CON trial (72 6 54 nmol/L � 10 h).
Conclusion: The consumption of cooked whole eggs is an effective way to increase the absorption of a-tocopherol and
g-tocopherol from a co-consumed meal that naturally contains vitamin E, such as a raw mixed-vegetable salad, in healthy
young men. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01951313.

Introduction
Vitamin E is a naturally occurring, fat-soluble nutrient that
contributes to the prevention of chronic diseases, including
cardiovascular disease and certain types of cancer, due to its
antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities (1–3). The current
RDA for vitamin E (a-tocopherol) is 15 mg/d for persons
aged $14 y (4), but average vitamin E intakes from food and
beverages by Americans aged $20 y are 10.3 mg/d in men and
7.7 mg/d in women (5). Nearly 90% of Americans have daily
vitamin E intakes lower than their age-, sex-, and health status–
specific Estimated Average Requirement (6). In addition to
promoting increased vitamin E intake, dietary approaches to
increase the absorption of vitamin E would help individuals
meet their body�s needs.
The potential health benefits of vitamin E are well known,
but there is limited research on the impact of factors that affect
the bioavailability of vitamin E. The absorption of vitamin E
from food sources can be influenced by several factors, including
the food matrix, cooking methods, amount and type of dietary
lipids, and interactions with digestive enzymes or other dietary
compounds (7). Because vitamin E is a fat-soluble nutrient, it is
widely accepted that dietary lipid is required for the absorption
of vitamin E (8, 9). Research that used an in vitro digestion
model showed that a-tocopherol bioavailability was promoted
by increasing the amount of soybean oil added to salad pur´

 because the micellarization of a-tocopherol during digestion was
enhanced (10). In humans, the absorption of a-tocopherol was
higher when participants consumed 150 mg encapsulated
a-tocopherol with meals containing 17.5 g dietary lipids than
with meals containing 2.7 g dietary lipids (8). However, the ex-
tent to which these effects would translate to the co-consumption
of a lipid-containing food in affecting the absorption of vitamin
E naturally present in a complex meal is not clear.
One large whole egg (;50 g) contains ;4.8 g total lipids (11),
predominantly in the yolk. We recently reported that co-consumption
of 150 g (3 eggs) cooked whole eggs increased the absorption of
carotenoids from a carotenoid-rich, raw, mixed-vegetable salad
by 3- to 8-fold (12). Because carotenoids and vitamin E are both
fat-soluble nutrients, we expected cooked whole eggs to also
increase the absorption of vitamin E contained in the same salad.
Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess the effect of
co-consuming cooked whole eggs with a raw mixed-vegetable
salad on a-tocopherol and g-tocopherol absorption because
a-tocopherol and g-tocopherol are the major forms found in
Western diets (9). We hypothesized that a raw mixed-vegetable
salad with 75 g (;1.5 eggs) or 150 g (;3 eggs) cooked whole eggs
would increase a-tocopherol and g-tocopherol absorption com-
pared with consuming the same salad without eggs.
Methods
Participants
Seventeen healthy, nonsmoking young men were recruited from the
greater Lafayette, Indiana, region and 16 of the 17 participants
completed this study (Figure 1). One participant withdrew due to a
personal medical condition unrelated to the study. No participants
reported egg allergy. The exclusion criteria were as follows: weight
change >3 kg within 3 mo, regularly exercising vigorously within 3 mo,
intestinal disorders including lipid malabsorption or lactose intolerance,
abnormal liver function (alanine transaminase >52 U/L or aspartate
transaminase >36 U/L) or kidney function [glomerular filtration rate
<60 mL/(min � 1.73m2)], fasting blood glucose >110 mg/dL, smoking,
drinking >2 servings of alcoholic drinks/d, and taking lipid-lowering
medications or dietary supplements that influence plasma lipid-
lipoprotein concentrations. All of the participants signed an informed
consent document and received a monetary stipend for their participa-
tion. The study protocol was approved by the Biomedical Institutional
Review Board of Purdue University (clinicaltrials.gov, NCT01951313).
Experimental design
For this randomized, single-blind, crossover-design experiment, 16
participants completed 3 trials that each included consuming a
controlled diet for 7 d followed by a testing day (12). In addition, 1-wk
dietary washout periods were scheduled between each of the trials. The
within-participant testing order randomization was determined by
using SAS 9.2 software (SAS Institute). The investigators were fully
blinded to the participants� test-day meals until after all testing and
sample analyses were completed, but the participants and dietitians
were not blinded to the meals.
Blood sample collections and dietary control
Seven days before each testing day, fasting blood was collected from
an antecubital vein by using venipuncture and was analyzed for plasma
a-tocopherol and g-tocopherol concentrations. For the next 7 d of each
trial, participants consumed a low-vitamin-E diet to reduce plasma
a-tocopherol and g-tocopherol (Supplemental Table 1). During the first
5 of these days, participants were counseled to consume a diet that
contained less than the Estimated Average Requirement for a-tocopherol
(<12 mg a-tocopherol/d). On days 6 and 7 of each controlled diet period,
participants consumed a diet [all foods and beverages were provided and
contained <60% of the Estimated Average Requirement for a-tocopherol
(<7 mg a-tocopherol/d)]. Participants were also counseled not to take
any dietary supplements during the study period.
On each of the 3 testing days, participants arrived at the Purdue
clinical research center after a 10-h overnight fast and a catheter
equipped with a disposable obturator was placed into an antecubital
vein. After blood was drawn, participants consumed a raw mixed-
vegetable salad without eggs [control (CON)6], with 75 g (;1.5 eggs)
scrambled whole eggs [low egg (LE)], or with 150 g (;3 eggs) scrambled
whole eggs [high egg (HE)]. The salad contained 100 g tomatoes, 62 g
shredded carrots, 70 g baby spinach, 25 g romaine lettuce, and 5 g
Chinese wolfberries, and was served with 3 g canola oil. All of the
vegetables and the same brand of eggs were purchased from the same
local market throughout the study period. The CON, LE, and HE salads
provided 3, 10.5 (7.5 g from eggs), and 18 g (15 g from eggs) total dietary
lipids, respectively. Scrambled whole eggs were prepared uniformly on
the basis of the American Egg Board�s recommendation (13) and
portioned appropriately to dose. After the test salads were consumed,
blood samples were drawn hourly for 10 h. After the 5-h blood draw, a
low-vitamin-E, low-fat lunch that contained 638 kcal, 25 g protein,
130 g carbohydrates, 2 g fat, and <0.5 mg a-tocopherol was consumed.
All of the controlled-diet menus and test salads were developed by
registered dietitians with the use of Pronutra software version 3.3
(Viocare, Inc.), and all of the foods provided to the participants were
prepared by staff in the Department of Nutrition Science Metabolic
Research Kitchen at Purdue University. Before the first 7-d controlled-
diet period, each participant�s habitual intakes of a-tocopherol and
g-tocopherol were estimated from 3-d diet records and by using
Nutrition Data System for Research software (NDSR 2012; Nutrition
Coordinating Center).
Sample collection and analyses
Plasma sample collection and TG-rich lipoprotein fraction
isolation. All blood samples were collected into tubes containing
EDTA and centrifuged (3000 3 g, 15 min, 4�C) to obtain plasma.
Aliquots of fasting-state plasma collected before and after each of
the three 7-d periods of diet control were flushed with nitrogen gas
and stored at 280�C until thawed for analyses. On each of the 3
testing days, fresh plasma samples were obtained from hourly blood
draws and TG-rich lipoprotein fractions (TRLs) were isolated as
previously reported (12). To minimize photo-oxidative reactions, all
plasma pipetting and TRL isolations were carried out under red light
in a dark room.
TG and total cholesterol analyses. Concentrations of TGs and total
cholesterol in the TRLs were analyzed by using a Cobas MIRAS Plus
chemistry analyzer (Roche Analytical Instruments).

 a-Tocopherol and g-tocopherol extraction and analyses. a-Tocopherol
and g-tocopherol were extracted from plasma, TRLs, and homogenates
of test salad and scrambled whole eggs, along with carotenoids, as
described by Kim et al. (12). All extractions were performed under red
light in a dark room to minimize photo-oxidative reactions. Extracted
a-tocopherol and g-tocopherol from plasma, TRLs, test salad, and
scrambled whole eggs were then analyzed by HPLC, as previously
reported (12). These analysis methodologies are documented to simul-
taneously analyze both carotenoids and vitamin E (14). Analyzed sam-
ples were quantified by using external standard curves for a-tocopherol
and g-tocopherol (Sigma-Aldrich).
Power calculation and statistical analysis
Power calculations were not performed specifically for the vitamin E
outcomes currently reported. The sample size of n = 16 participants for this
randomized crossover study was based on a power calculation from
previous research, which showed that the total carotenoid concentration
0- to 10-h AUC (AUCs0–10 h) in TRLs was higher when the same raw mixed-
vegetable salad used for the current study was consumed with 20 com-
pared with 3 g dietary lipids (15). We estimated that a group size of $15
participants would provide $90% power at an a = 0.05 to detect a dif-
ference in carotenoid absorption when the salad was consumed with 150 g
scrambled whole eggs compared with when it was consumed without eggs
(i.e., with 18 compared with 3 g dietary lipids, respectively) (12). This power
calculation seems reasonable to apply to the vitamin E outcomes because
both carotenoids and vitamin E are absorbed along with dietary lipids.
To determine the postprandial responses of TGs, total cholesterol,
a-tocopherol, and g-tocopherol in TRLs, the concentration of each
variable at each postprandial time point was baseline-corrected by
subtracting its fasting concentration. Baseline-corrected a-tocopherol
and g-tocopherol concentrations in TRLs were also normalized by the
a-tocopherol and g-tocopherol contents in the test salad and scrambled
whole eggs consumed each testing day. Repeated-measures ANOVA was
used to determine the main effects of time (of sample collection) and trial
and the time-by-trial interaction. One-factor ANOVA with post hoc
Tukey�s test was also applied to examine differences between baseline-
corrected a-tocopherol and g-tocopherol concentrations at each time
point and baseline-corrected positive incremental AUCs0–10 h of TGs,
total cholesterol, a-tocopherol, and g-tocopherol in TRLs. Paired t tests
were used to compare plasma a-tocopherol and g-tocopherol concen-
trations before and after the 7-d, controlled, low-vitamin-E diet periods.
For each of the 3 trials, potential differences between a-tocopherol
and g-tocopherol absorption were assessed using paired t tests. All of
the analyses were performed in SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute) and unequal var-
iances were adjusted. Data are presented as least-squares means
(lsmeans) 6 SEs of the lsmean (SE) unless otherwise noted, and
significance was accepted at P < 0.05 (2-tailed).
Additional testing poststudy
After completing all of the experimental trials, sample analyses, data
processing, and statistical analyses described above, we deemed it im-
portant to conduct an additional trial to assess the effects of consuming
scrambled whole eggs alone (i.e., without co-consuming the raw mixed-
vegetable salad) on a-tocopherol and g-tocopherol absorption. The
results from this additional trial are useful to evaluate the impact of
co-consuming eggs with the salad on vitamin E absorption because
scrambled whole eggs also contain a-tocopherol and g-tocopherol.
Therefore, we re-recruited 9 of the 16 participants who completed the
initial study (12); all re-recruited participants met our inclusion criteria.
After signing a new institutional review board (IRB)–approved study
consent form, each participant consumed the controlled diet for 7 d, and
a testing day with the same experimental protocol described above was
completed. The ‘‘meal’’ consumed at the start of the 10-h testing period
was 150 g scrambled whole eggs (no salad). The data from the HE,
CON, and scrambled whole egg–only trial were statistically assessed by
using repeated-measures ANOVA. This statistical assessment was
conducted recognizing that, although the data were obtained by using
a repeated-measures experimental design, this assessment included fewer
participants and partial randomization of trial order. The a-tocopherol
and g-tocopherol absorption results from the HE, CON, and scrambled
whole egg–only trials were also used to document the predicted com-
pared with actual absorption of these vitamin E compounds.
Results
Participant characteristics and compliance to the 7-d,
controlled, low-vitamin-E diet period. Mean 6 SD age and
BMI (in kg/m2) of the 16 men (8 Asian, 7 white, and 1 African
American) were 24 6 4 y and 24 6 2, respectively (Table 1). The
participants were apparently healthy with clinically normal
fasting plasma glucose and lipid-lipoprotein concentrations
and liver and kidney functions. The usual a-tocopherol and
g-tocopherol dietary intakes were 13.2 6 6.8 and 16.1 6 6.4 mg/d,
respectively.
Mean plasma a-tocopherol and g-tocopherol concentrations
before the controlled low-vitamin-E diet was consumed for 7 d
were 22.8 6 2.8 and 3.2 6 1.2 mmol/L, respectively, and 18.5 6
2.8 and 2.3 6 0.3 mmol/L, respectively, after the low-vitamin-E
diet was consumed. The 19% and 28% (P < 0.0001) reductions
in plasma a-tocopherol and g-tocopherol concentrations are
consistent with the participants successfully completing the 7-d,
controlled, low-vitamin-E diet periods. Comparable participant
characteristics and dietary compliance results were obtained for
the subset of 9 participants who also completed the scrambled
whole egg trial (Supplemental Table 2).
a-Tocopherol and g-tocopherol contents in the test salad
and scrambled whole eggs. The contents of a-tocopherol and
g-tocopherol in the test salad were 2.1 and 2.0 mg/serving,
respectively (Supplemental Figure 1A, B). The contents of
a-tocopherol and g-tocopherol in the scrambled whole egg
(including measurements taken during the scrambled whole egg–
only trials completed after the randomized HE, LE, and CON
trials) were 7.6 and 7.4 mg/g of scrambled whole egg, respec-
tively (Supplemental Figure 1C, D). Therefore, co-consuming 75
and 150 g scrambled whole eggs provided an additional 0.57 and
1.14 mg a-tocopherol and an additional 0.56 and 1.11 mg
g-tocopherol to the test salad.

 TG and total cholesterol concentrations in the TRLs. The
composite TG AUCs0–10 h in the TRLs was higher for the HE
trial than for the LE and CON trials, whereas the composite total
cholesterol AUCs0–10 h in the TRLs were not different among these
three trials (Table 2). The consumption of 3 scrambled whole eggs
alone (n = 9 participants) did not apparently influence TG or total
cholesterol AUCs0–10 h in the TRLs compared with consuming
them with salad (HE trial) (Table 2).
a-Tocopherol and g-tocopherol concentrations in the
TRLs. a-Tocopherol AUCs0–10h in TRLs was higher (P < 0.05)
for the HE trial (981 6 162 nmol/L � 10 h) than for the LE
(311 6 162 nmol/L � 10 h) and CON (117 6 162 nmol/L � 10 h)
trials, which did not differ from one another. From hours 2 to 6,
the HE trial resulted in significantly higher a-tocopherol con-
centrations in TRLs than the LE and CON trials (Figure 2A).
The g-tocopherol AUCs0–10 h in TRLs was also higher (P < 0.05)
for the HE trial (402 6 54 nmol/L � 10 h) than for the CON trial
(72 6 54 nmol/L � 10 h), but no difference was observed between
the HE and LE trials (226 6 54 nmol/L � 10 h). From hours 3 to
6, the HE trial resulted in significantly higher g-tocopherol
concentrations in TRLs than the CON trial (Figure 2B).
Comparison between a-tocopherol and g-tocopherol
absorption. Expressed per milligram of intake, a-tocopherol
and g-tocopherol absorptions were not different between the
CON and LE trials, but the absorption of a-tocopherol was
higher than g-tocopherol for the HE trial (303 6 83 compared
with 129 6 94 nmol/L � 10 h; P < 0.05) (Table 3).
Predicted compared with actual vitamin E absorption.
Among the 9 participants who also completed the scrambled
whole egg–only trial, mean 6 SE a-tocopherol AUCs0–10 h in TRLs
when the salad (CON) and 3 eggs were consumed separately
were 76 6 23 and 305 6 80 nmol/L � 10 h, respectively. If the
consumption of these foods together would not influence the
absorption of a-tocopherol contained in each food separately
then the predicted total absorption would be 381 nmol/L � 10 h
(76 + 305). However, the co-consumption of salad and 3 eggs
(HE trial) resulted in an actual a-tocopherol absorption of 992 6
397 nmol/L � 10 h. Thus, actual a-tocopherol absorption in the
HE trial was 1.6-fold higher than the predicted absorption. By
presuming that the absorption of the a-tocopherol contained
in eggs was not changed by co-consumption of the salad
(305 nmol/L � 10 h), then co-consumption of 3 eggs increased the
absorption of a-tocopherol contained in the salad only by
8.0-fold compared with when the salad was consumed without
eggs. Expressed per milligram of intake, a-tocopherol absorption
was lower from salad (CON: 36 6 11 nmol/L � 10 h per milligram
of a-tocopherol intake) than from 3 eggs (268 6 70 nmol/L � 10 h
per milligram of a-tocopherol intake). When salad and eggs were
co-consumed, the actual absorption of a-tocopherol was higher
(HE: 306 6 122 nmol/L � 10 h per milligram of a-tocopherol
intake) than the predicted absorption (117 nmol/L � 10 h per
milligram of a-tocopherol intake) (Supplemental Figure 2A).
Statistical analysis was performed by using lsmeans 6 SEs, and
a-tocopherol AUCs0–10 h in TRLs were higher for actual com-
pared with scrambled whole egg–only trial and CON (992 6 117
compared with 305 6 117 compared with 76 6 117 nmol/L �
10 h; P < 0.05).
Comparable results were obtained for g-tocopherol absorp-
tion [salad (CON): 60 6 30; 3 eggs only: 157 6 33; predicted
(salad + eggs): 217; and actual (HE): 348 6 99 nmol/L � 10 h].
Actual g-tocopherol absorption was 0.6-fold higher than
predicted absorption. By presuming that the absorption of the
g-tocopherol contained in eggs was not changed by co-con-
sumption of the salad (157 nmol/L � 10 h), then co-consumption
of 3 eggs increased the absorption of g-tocopherol contained in
the salad by 2.2-fold compared with when the salad was
consumed without eggs. Expressed per milligram of intake,
g-tocopherol absorptions were as follows—salad (CON): 30 6
15 nmol/L � 10 h; 3 eggs only: 142 6 30 nmol/L � 10 h; predicted
(salad + eggs): 70 nmol/L � 10 h; and actual (HE): 112 6 32
nmol/L � 10 h per milligram of g-tocopherol intake (Supple-
mental Figure 2B). The g-tocopherol AUCs0–10
h in TRLs
(lsmean 6 SE) was higher for actual than for scrambled whole
egg–only trial and CON (348 6 50 compared with 157 6 50
compared with 60 6 50 nmol/L � 10 h; P < 0.05).
Discussion
Currently, most people living in the United States underconsume
vitamin E from foods and beverages (6, 16). In addition to
encouraging the consumption of vitamin E–rich foods, strategies
to increase the absorption of vitamin E should be explored
to help meet the body�s needs. Co-consuming dietary lipids
promotes the absorption of fat-soluble nutrients (17, 18), but
past research on vitamin E absorption was limited to assessing
the effect of dietary lipids on the absorption of vitamin E
supplements. For example, higher fat intake achieved by varying
the fat content in milk increased the absorption of encapsulated
a-tocopherol (8). The current study assessed the impact of an
endogenous food source of lipids (11) on the absorption of
vitamin E contained in a natural food matrix, raw vegeta-
bles. Our findings support that the co-consumption of cooked
whole eggs is an effective way to increase the absorption of
a-tocopherol and g-tocopherol from raw mixed vegetables.
Specifically, a-tocopherol and g-tocopherol absorptions were
;7.5-fold and ;4.5-fold higher when the salad was consumed
with 3 whole eggs (HE trial) than without eggs (CON trial).

 The attribution of the higher postprandial vitamin E response
in the HE trial compared with the CON trial to increased
absorption of the vitamin E contained in the salad vegetables is
confounded by eggs, which also contain vitamin E (19). Thus,
we needed a way to distinguish between the absorption of
vitamin E contained in the salad ingredients compared with that
from the eggs alone. To address this issue we re-recruited
participants for a fourth trial. The results showed that, when the
salad and 3 eggs were consumed together (HE trial), the actual
absorptions of a-tocopherol and g-tocopherol were 1.6- and
0.6-fold higher than their corresponding predicted responses and
the plasma responses of a-tocopherol and g-tocopherol con-
tained in the salad only were 8.0- and 2.2-fold higher than when
the salad was consumed without eggs. These fold-change values
for vitamin E contained in the salad should be evaluated with
caution because we did not assess the effect of consuming the
salad on the absorption of vitamin E contained in egg.
In the current study, the consumption of the salad with 3 eggs
(HE trial) promoted an ;7.5-fold higher a-tocopherol absorp-
tion than consuming the salad alone (CON trial), and this effect
may be attributable to both the lipids and phospholipids in egg
yolk (20). In humans, a-tocopherol absorption was higher when
participants consumed a meal containing 150 mg a-tocopherol
with 17.5 g lipids from butter or full-fat milk than with the same
meal with 2.7 g lipids from semi-skimmed milk (8). In addition,
healthy young adults showed increased a-tocopherol absorption
when they consumed a mixed meal containing 22 mg a-tocopherol
with increasing dietary lipids (0% compared with 6% compared
with 21% of energy from lipids) (21). Collectively, these results
are consistent with in vitro research that showed that a-tocopherol
bioavailability was higher when soybean oil was added to a pur´
eed
vegetable mixture, which enhanced micellarization of a-tocopherol
during digestion (10).
Interestingly, there were differences in vitamin E and TG
responses between the trials, but no difference in total choles-
terol was observed. It was reported that increasing dietary
cholesterol intake affects postprandial lipoprotein responses in
humans (22). However, a previous study reported that phos-
phatidylcholine in egg yolk inhibited cholesterol uptake by the
intestine (23). This may explain why we did not observe a
difference in total cholesterol AUCs0–10 h in TRLs, although egg
yolk contains high amounts of dietary cholesterol.
In general, research has mainly focused on the bioavailability of
a-tocopherol because it is a predominant form of vitamin E found
in human plasma (24, 25) and the primary form present in vitamin
supplements (24, 26). However, g-tocopherol is the most abundant
vitamin E form in the US diet (27), and there is mounting of
evidence that it has health-promoting properties distinct from
a-tocopherol (26), including higher anti-inflammatory activity
(28, 29) and an ability to protect pancreatic b cells from insulinoma
(30). Therefore, more dietary approaches are needed to increase the
bioavailability of g-tocopherol. We observed an ;4.5-fold increase
in g-tocopherol absorption in the HE trial compared with the CON
trial. This finding requires verification by new human research.
The progressively higher a-tocopherol and g-tocopherol
AUCs0–10 h responses in TRLs for the CON, LE, and HE trials
were hypothesized to occur. However, the higher absorptions
were only statistically supported for the HE trial compared with
CON trial, but not for the LE trial compared with the CON trial.
These results may have practical implications on how this
research is conveyed to the general public, because statistically,
individuals would need to consume 3 eggs with their salad,
whereas 1.5 eggs would not promote vitamin E absorption.
Caution is therefore warranted for this interpretation and any
ultimate consumer recommendation. The lack of statistical
support for the 1.7- and 2.1-fold higher a-tocopherol and
g-tocopherol absorptions, respectively, when 10.5 g (LE) compared

 with 3.0 g (CON) lipids were consumed with the salad is likely
due to the small sample size and low statistical power. The same
issue may have affected research in 20 participants, which showed
that dairy lipids (7.9 compared with 0.2 g dairy lipids) did not
significantly influence the absorption of a-tocopherol measured in
plasma (not TRL) over a 72-h time period (31).
The current observation that the absorption of a-tocopherol
(per milligram of dietary intake) was 1.3-fold higher than
g-tocopherol during the HE trial is consistent with an in vitro
study in which the bioaccessibility of a-tocopherol was 2.7-fold
higher than g-tocopherol, assessed as the transfer from romaine
lettuce (the food matrix) to micelles with a constant amount of
dietary lipid (32). The presence of vitamin E hydroxylase in
small intestine mucosa (33) may also partially contribute to the
greater metabolism of g-tocopherol, resulting in lower absorp-
tion of g-tocopherol than of a-tocopherol. Past research in hu-
mans provided inconsistent results that a-tocopherol absorption
was not different (34) or higher (35) than g-tocopherol. But, these
studies used higher doses [50 mg/dose (34) and 1000 mg/dose
(35)] of encapsulated a-tocopherol and g-tocopherol, which
are ;1600% and 32,000% higher, respectively, than the ;3.2 mg
of these vitamin E isoforms per dose consumed in the HE trial.
More in vivo assessments of the apparent absorption of different
vitamin E isoforms at physiologic doses and in natural food
matrices are warranted in humans.
Strengths of this research include the novelty of assessing the
impact of one food (eggs) on the absorption of a nutrient
(vitamin E) contained in another food (salad) and including
measurements of both a-tocopherol and g-tocopherol. With
regard to potential limitations, we are aware that there are
several alternative ways of describing the postprandial vitamin E
responses other than using the word ‘‘absorption.’’ We chose
‘‘absorption’’ as the descriptor because we specifically measured
the a-tocopherol and g-tocopherol concentrations within TRLs,
which mainly represent newly absorbed dietary vitamin E
appearing in plasma. One limitation of this research is that we
only studied men, although our previous research showed that
the absorption of fat-soluble nutrients, including carote-
noids, was comparable between men and women (15). An-
other limitation may be that assessments of the absorption of
a-tocopherol and g-tocopherol were secondary analyses, not
based on a priori hypotheses or with outcome-specific sample
size estimates. In addition, the scrambled whole egg–only trial
was done subsequent to the other 3 randomized trials after we
identified the importance of including a trial to measure the
absorption of a-tocopherol and g-tocopherol from eggs. The
lipids in egg yolk consist of neutral lipids (65%), phospholipids
(31%), and cholesterol (4%) (36); and we recognize that
phospholipids may also enhance vitamin E absorption (20).
Thus, more research is needed to assess the specific impact of
those components of egg yolk on vitamin E absorption.
In summary, the consumption of cooked whole eggs is an
effective way to increase the absorption of a-tocopherol and
g-tocopherol from co-consumed low-fat foods that naturally
contain vitamin E, such as a raw mixed-vegetable salad. Co-
consuming cooked whole eggs with a vegetable salad improves
the nutritional value of the vegetables, which are underconsumed
by most of the US population (6, 16).
