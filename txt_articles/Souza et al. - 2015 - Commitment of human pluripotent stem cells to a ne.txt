Abstract
Flavonoids are polyphenolic compounds that are ubiquitous
in plants and have biological effects on cancer cells and other
cell types. In particular, apigenin (API) has been shown to
bind to estrogen receptors, which affect the development,
maturation, function, and plasticity of the nervous system.
The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of 4?,5,7-
trihydroxyflavone (API) upon the neural differentiation of
human pluripotent stem cells. Treatment of both human
embryonic stem cells and human induced pluripotent stem
cells with API increased the number of nestin (NES�) neural
progenitor cells compared to untreated controls. API also in-
duced the expression of neuronal markers, such as b-tubulin-
III (TUBB3), microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2),
polysialylated-neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM),
synapsin 1 (SYN1), neurofilament (NEF), choline acetyl-
transferase (CHAT), glutamate decarboxylase (GAD1), and
parvalbumin (PVALB) proteins. Antagonists of estrogen
receptors (ESR1 and ESR2) suppressed the effects of API.
API-induced differentiation was followed by increased ex-
pression of retinoic acid (RA) receptors (RARA and RARB)
and retinoic X receptor (RXR) G, but not RARG1 or RXRB.
Neural differentiation induced by API was drastically reduced
by the inhibition of RARs. In addition, API also increased
synaptogenesis in RA-differentiated neurons. These findings
suggest that API induces neural differentiation of human
pluripotent stem cells through estrogen receptor and RAR
signaling and improves their functional differentiation into
neurons.

In context
Human embryonic stem cells can give rise to any cell type
of the human body. One of the main challenges in regen-
erative biology is to drive these cells to become specific cells
types, preferentially by adopting simple and less expensive
approaches. Here we show that, by simply adding a plant
compound called apigenin to human pluripotent stem cells,
they become neurons after a few days. We also observed that
neurons could make more sophisticated connections among
themselves after treatment with this natural compound.
This observation suggests that flavonoids derived from plants
can be used as a tool for the production of neurons in a dish.
Moreover, since flavonoids are present at high amounts in
some foods, we can speculate that a diet rich in flavonoids
may influence the formation of neurons and the way they
communicate within the brain.

 F
lavonoids are polyphenolic compounds present in
plants, which also have biological effects on animal
cells. Plants containing these bioactive compounds
have been used for centuries to promote cardiovascular
health, reduce inflammation, and prevent cancer (1).
Understanding the effect of flavonoids on human neural
differentiation and maturation is particularly interesting
since these compounds may offer a natural and accessible
way to prevent or treat neurological disorders. Incorpor-
ating flavonoids into stem cell cultures may also generate
more robust and reliable models of neurons in a dish.
It has been previously shown that the flavonoid
agathisflavone (FAB), a product of the oxidative coupling
of an apigenin (API) dimer, enhances neurogenesis in
murine pluripotent stem cells by increasing the expression
of all trans retinoic acid (RA) receptors (RAR) (2). As a
single molecule, API also exhibits neuroprotective effects
in mice models (3�5).
API has also been described as pro-estrogenic, acting
as a phyto-estrogen and/or as an estrogen receptor (ER)
modulator (6�8). Estrogen is known to affect the develop-
ment, maturation, function, and plasticity of the nervous
system, including synaptogenesis (9).
It is known that human and rodent neural progenitors
express ERs, including the ESR1 and ESR2 forms (10�12),
and that ER and RAR signaling pathways interact during
cell division and differentiation (13, 14). Therefore, in
human pluripotent stem cells and neural derivatives, ERs
could represent a target for API to affect proliferation and
differentiation (15, 16), not necessarily having the same
expected effects as estrogens (17). Nevertheless, the poten-
tial of API to modulate the proliferation and differentia-
tion of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) or neurons through
ER and RAR pathways has never been explored.
Here we showed that API promotes neuronal conver-
sion of human pluripotent stem cells as well as neuronal
maturation through ER and RAR signaling.

Results
API enhances expression of neural markers
in human pluripotent stem cells
The role of the pro-estrogenic flavonoid API as a media-
tor of neurogenesis in human pluripotent stem cells was
investigated by measuring the expression of neural markers
(18, 19) such as nestin (NES�; 5.191.7% control cells;
59.092.4% API-treated cells; Fig. 1a, c, and e; p�
0.00103) and SOX2 (6.092.1% control cells; 46.191.8%
API-treated cells; Fig. 1b, d, and f; p�0.00421), both
upregulated in treated cells. API was used at a concen-
tration of 10 mM (Supplementary Fig. 1a). Treatments with
less than 10 mM of API (1�10 mM) to induce neurogenesis
produced inconsistent results in our model. Nonlinear
results at lower doses of API have also been described in
other cells (20, 21).
To investigate whether API interferes with cell pro-
liferation or cell death, NPCs (after 18 days of culture)
were stained for phosphorylated histone H3 (PH3), a G2/
mitosis-specific marker, and cleaved caspase-3 (CASP3).
API treatment did not affect the percentage of cells stained
for PH3 (Supplementary Fig. 3a�c), but it decreased cell
death as evidenced by the reduced percentage of cells
stained for CASP3 (Supplementary Fig. 3d�f). In order to
confirm that API effects were not cell-specific, we also
applied API to two different human induced pluripotent
stem (iPS) cell lines, obtaining similar results (Supplementary
Fig. 2).

 ERs affect neural differentiation induced by API
Considerable evidence confirms a role for ER signaling
in the differentiation and maturation of neurons (22, 23).
Based on these observations, we postulated that the pro-
estrogenic effects of API could account for the induced
neural differentiation observed here. To investigate the in-
volvement of ER signaling on API-induced neural commit-
ment in human embryonic stem (hES) cells, antagonists of
either the ESR1 or ESR2 forms of the ER were added to
cultures before and during API treatment. Neural com-
mitment was then measured at Day 18. Pharmacological
antagonism of ESR1 achieved by using methyl-piperidino-
pyrazole (MPP), a selective and widely used antagonist of
this receptor, strongly inhibited NES� expression. While
in control cultures (no MPP) API treatment resulted in
an average of 69.7% NES� cells (Fig. 2a), the addition of
MPP reduced the number of NES� cells to 15.8% (Fig. 2b
and d). This difference represents a statistically significant
decrease in NES� cells, attributable to ESR1 signaling in-
hibition (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Fig. 4a). Furthermore,
blocking signaling of ESR2 with pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine
(PHTPP) also reduced the number of NES� cells from
69.7 to 51.0%, again representing a reduction in API effec-
tiveness (Fig. 2c and d). Supplementary Fig. 4a.
RAR/RXRs are involved in API-induced neural
differentiation
Previously, it was shown that FAB, which is formed by
two API molecules, was able to increase neurogenesis in
murine embryonic stem cells by stimulating the expres-
sion of RARs (2). It is also known that activation of ERs
promotes upregulation of RARs (RAR/RXRs), which have
also been shown to be essential for neuronal differentiation
(24). Therefore, we hypothesized that API would also
induce the expression of RAR in human cells. Indeed, we
observed that API treatment increased the expression of
RARA (Fig. 3b and c) compared to the control condi-
tions (Fig. 3a and c). We also observed an increase in
RARB (Fig. 3d and e) and RXRG (Fig. 3d and h) in the
API-treated group. In contrast, the expression levels
of RARG (Fig. 3d and f) and RXRA (Fig. 3d and g)
were not affected by API, and RXRB was not detected
(Fig. 3d). To confirm the involvement of RARs on
human neural commitment induced by API, we applied
antagonists to cultured cells 2 h before and during API
differentiation (Day 0 to Day 6). Antagonists tested were
ER50891 (RARA), LE135 (RARB), MM11253 (RARG),
and UVI3003 (RXRs) (Fig. 4). In general, RAR antag-
onism strongly inhibited the effects of API on NES

used were (b) 10 nM methyl-piperidino-pyrazole (MPP; ESR1) and (c) 1 mM pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine (PHTPP; ESR2).
API-induced neural differentiation was inhibited by ER antagonists. A reduction in the number of NES� cells was observed
after treatment with MPP (one-way ANOVA, p�0.0000833769) and with PHTPP (one-way ANOVA, p�0.00478). (d) Bar

 expression (Supplementary Fig. 4 and Fig. 4b). In this
series of experiments, API induced NES expression in an
average of 84.2% of cells (Fig. 4a and f). However,
ER50891 efficiently reduced the number of NES� cells,
reaching only 16.0% of NES� cells (Fig. 4b and f).
Blocking RARB signaling also attenuated the effects
of API. LE135 reduced the number of NES� cells, resul-
ting in only 11.9% NES� cells (Fig. 4c and f). Blocking
the signaling of RARG (with MM 11253) and RXRs
(with UVI 3003) reduced the number of NES� cells after
API treatment to 34.1 and 38.1%, respectively (Fig. 4d�f).
The reduction in the number of NES� cells observed after
treatment with antagonists (Fig. 4f) indicates that RARs
participate, at least partially, in the pro-differentiation
effects of API.
NPCs induced by API become neurons
To investigate whether API-induced NPCs would be able
to further differentiate into neurons, we isolated neural
rosettes and allowed cells to differentiate for an additional
25 days. During these 25 days, we observed numerous
processes growing from the cells, condensed soma and

 long neurites (Fig. 5b), similar to what is observed in
neuronal primary cultures. These cells became positive for
neuronal markers, such as b-tubulin-III (TUBB3, Fig. 5j),
microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2, Fig. 5d), poly-
sialylated-neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM,
Fig. 5l), neurofilament 200 (NEF, Fig. 5n), myelin basic
protein (MBP, Fig. 5n), and calretinin (CALB2, Fig. 5h).
API untreated controls could not be investigated further
to check for mature neuronal markers, since these cul-
tures do not form rosettes to be manually picked until
Day 35. For this reason and also because the cells started
to detach from the plate, we were not able to compare the
amounts of markers between the two groups after this
time point (Supplementary Fig. 5a and c).
Next, these neurons were investigated to see if they
displayed any evidence of functionality. Indeed, neurons
expressed synaptic markers such as synapsin I (SYN1,
Fig. 5f), discs large homolog 4 (DLG4), also known as
postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95), and synapto-
physin (SYP, Fig. 5p). Co-localization of presynaptic
SYP and postsynaptic DLG4 (Fig. 5p) was also observed,
suggesting that API-induced neurons were able to form
synapses. Undifferentiated hES cells were used as nega-
tive controls (Fig. 5a) for all neuronal markers (Fig. 5c, e,
g, i, k, m, and o).
API induces distinct subtypes of neural cells
Among the different subtypes of neurons generated by
treatment with API, cholinergic neurons (CHAT-positive;
Fig. 6b and Supplementary Fig. 6) and GABAergic neu-
rons (GAD1-positive, Fig. 6b) could be observed, includ-
ing some cells that stained positive for parvalbumin
(PVALB�, Fig. 6f), besides glial fibrillary acidic protein
(GFAP, Supplementary Fig. 6) and brain lipid-binding
protein (FABP7), which are glial markers (Fig. 6d). Hence,
cell types generated after API exposure were heteroge-
neous, indicating that API can be used as the starting
point for obtaining cultures of diverse cell subtypes.
Control cells (pluripotent hES cells) were negative for all
tested neuronal and glial markers (Fig. 6a, c, and e, and
Supplementary Fig. 6).
Neurons treated with API show increased
synaptogenesis
The results reported so far have consistently shown that
API efficiently induces neural differentiation when ap-
plied to pluripotent stem cells. However, we were unable
to check whether API further differentiates more neuro-
nal precursors into mature neurons, because control
cultures simply did not reach any neuronal differentiation
spontaneously during the time points investigated. To
circumvent this technical problem, we generated neurons
by another method (RA treatment for 6 days, followed by
a further 45 days in culture) and then treated them with
1 mM API for 72 h (Supplementary Fig. 1e). Control and
API-treated cultures were then immunostained for DLG4
and synaptophysin to analyze synapse formation, markers
of advanced neuronal maturation. As shown by confocal
fluorescence microscopy, hES-derived neurons exposed
to API exhibited a pronounced increase in co-localized
synaptophysin and DLG4 compared to untreated neu-
rons (Fig. 7a�c), suggesting that treatment of neurons
with API improves synaptogenesis. API treatment increa-
sed SYP (Fig. 7d and f) by 74.3% compared to RA-induced
neurons without API post-treatment (Fig. 7d and f). The
treatment also increased DLG4 expression (Fig. 7f), but this
increase was not statistically significant (Fig. 7e).
Discussion
In this study, we investigated whether treatment with
API was able to induce neural conversion of human
pluripotent stem cells through activation of ERs and
RAR/RXRs.
Neuronal differentiation of human pluripotent stem
cells after API exposure gave rise to neural progenitors
expressing NES and SOX2, as well as to neurons. This
neural conversion was dependent, at least partly, on ER
activation, since ER antagonists were capable of reducing

treatment is characterized by the presence of specific neuronal

protein (FABP7), (e, f) parvalbumin (PVALB), and (e, f) tau
protein (MAPT). Pluripotent hES H9 cells were used as a

 differentiation of these cells. It is well known that estro-
gen may affect cell growth, proliferation, and differentia-
tion (25). In the nervous system, estrogen can also prevent
cell death (26�28) or accelerate peripheral nerve regenera-
tion (29), as well as stimulate neurite outgrowth (23, 30). It
is worthy of mention, though, that flavonoids such as
Icaritin, which can also activate ERs, direct mouse
pluripotent stem cells toward neuronal differentiation in
an ER-independent manner (10). These results suggest that
not necessarily all flavonoids that bind to ERs will have an
effect mediated by these receptors, at least in murine cells.
Activation of ERs is also known to upregulate RARs
and RXRs (24). The fact that API promotes differentia-
tion through activation of ERs raises the possibility that
the increase in the expression of RARs (RARA, RARB,
and RXRG) is a consequence of the activation of these
receptors by the flavonoids (31). Previously, it was shown
that FAB, a product of the oxidative coupling of two
API molecules, also increased the expression of RARs,
RARA, and RARB, potentiating neuronal differentia-
tion promoted by RA in mouse pluripotent stem cells (2).
Future works should clarify this correlation between
RARs and ERs.
It is widely known that RARs are relevant to neuro-
genesis, since they are present in the subventricular
zone of adult mice (32) and, when sequentially activated,
RARB and RARA lead to neuronal differentiation in
cultured NPCs (33). Additionally, the introduction of the
human RARB deletion mutant (bDC) into mouse embryo-
nic stem cells resulted in desensitization to RA-induced
differentiation (34). Furthermore, RXRG is differentially
expressed during remyelination of oligodendrocytes (35).

 Our data showed that API treatment increased not only
the expression of RXRG, but also that of MBP. Indeed,
knockdown of RXRG or the receptor blockade inhibi-
ted oligodendrocyte differentiation in vitro, while admi-
nistering RXR agonists to demyelinated cerebellar slice
cultures or aged rats, caused an increase in remyelinated
axons (35). We demonstrated that blocking RARs reduced
the effects of API, which suggests that human pluripotent
stem cells require the recapitulation of important steps
of in vivo differentiation. It is noteworthy that some ER
and RAR/RXR antagonists prevented differentiation more
than others, suggesting that these receptors do not
contribute to differentiation to the same extent. Although
we found that several types of ERs and RAR/RXRs are
involved in API-induced differentiation of hES cells,
more studies are needed to determine whether additional
receptors participate in this process and which are the
downstream biochemical cascades activated. API gave
rise to NPCs that generated heterogeneous and mature
neuronal cells (e.g. cholinergic and GABAergic neurons),
indicating that it can be used as a starting point for
obtaining enriched and diverse cultures of neurons that
are affected in various brain disorders, such as amyotro-
phic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, and schizophrenia.
Finally, we also observed that API stimulates the for-
mation of synapses in human neurons. After all, human
neurons differentiated from pluripotent stem cells usually
mature and form synapses at a slow pace in vitro (36). This
observation suggests that API could be used as a tool for
neural differentiation, to accelerate neuronal maturation
and synaptogenesis, and to make more robust in vitro
models. These results endorse that API is not only a potent
neurogenic agent but also a strong synaptogenic driver.
Strong evidence indicates estrogen’s ability to regulate
synapse structure and function (23, 37). Shum et al. 2015
(38) showed that human iPS-derived neurons were re-
sponsive to 17b-estradiol and that treatment with 17b-
estradiol for 24 h resulted in an increase in dendritic
branching. Estrogens may delay the onset or ameliorate
the severity of psychiatric and neurodegenerative disor-
ders such as schizophrenia (39, 40), depression (41, 42),
Alzheimer’s disease (43, 44), and Parkinson’s disease (45,
46); however; the use of estrogen-based therapies is limited
by the increased risk of estrogen-dependent tumors and
cardiovascular problems. An alternative approach would be
to mimic estrogenic-mediated positive effects by modulat-
ing specific ERs with other estrogenic compounds (47, 48),
such as some flavonoids classified as selective ER mod-
ulators (SERMs). Therefore, API is a strong candidate for
replacing estrogen in neuronal differentiation strategies.
