ABSTRACT
Background The association between match 
congestion and injury rates in professional football has 
yielded conflicting results.
Aim To analyse associations between match congestion 
on an individual player level and injury rates during 
professional football matches.
Methods Data from a prospective cohort study of 
professional football with 133 170 match observations 
were analysed with Poisson regressions. Associations 
between short-term match congestion, defined as 
number of days between two match exposures (≤3, 4, 
5, 6 and 7–10 days) and injury rates were analysed. To 
analyse the influence of long-term match congestion, 
defined as individual match exposure hours in the 30 
days preceding a match, observations were categorised 
into three groups (low, ≤4.5; medium, >4.5 to ≤7.5; and 
high, >7.5 hours).
Results No differences in total match injury rates were 
found between the reference category (≤3 days) and the 
other categories of short-term congestion. Muscle injury 
rates were significantly lower in matches preceded by 6 
(rate ratio (RR) 0.79; 95% CI 0.65 to 0.95) or 7–10 days 
(RR 0.81; 95% CI 0.71 to 0.93) compared with ≤3 days 
since the last match exposure. No differences in total and 
muscle injury rates between the three long-term match 
congestion groups were found.
Conclusions In this study of male professional football 
players, there were no match congestion-related 
differences in total match injury rates, but muscle injury 
rates during matches were lower when players were 
given at least 6 days between their match exposures.
InTROduCTIOn
Professional football carries a high risk of injury, 
with muscle injuries being the most common 
injury type.1 Muscular fatigue, defined as a decline 
in muscle performance associated with muscle 
activity,2 and signs of muscle damage may last more 
than 72 
hours after a football match.3–6 Players 
may also experience mental fatigue following a 
match,7 with decreasing decision-making abilities 
as a possible consequence.8 Almost one-third of 
matches for top-level professional football teams 
are played within a 72-hour interval.9 It is therefore 
plausible that players are not able to fully recover, 
physiologically and/or mentally, between matches.
Studies focused on short-term match congestion 
have shown that injury rates are higher if a team 
plays two matches separated by 4 or fewer compared 
with 6 or more days;9 10 in particular, muscle injury 
rates increase with fewer days between matches.9 
Long-term match congestion has also been investi-
gated in a few studies. While most of these studies 
have shown associations between match congestion 
and high injury rates,9 11 12 one study reported no 
such association.13 Even though these studies have 
provided important initial information about the 
relationship between injuries and match conges-
tion in professional football, they have been limited 
by either small sample sizes or by analysing match 
congestion at the team level. Furthermore, the 
combined effect of short-term and long-term match 
congestion on injury rates has not been investigated 
in football.
The aim of the present study was to analyse 
associations 
between 
match 
congestion 
and 
match injury rates at an individual player level. A 
secondary aim was to analyse whether associations 
between short-term match congestion and match 
injury rates are dependent on the player’s long-term 
match congestion.
MeThOdS
This study was based on post hoc analyses of data 
gathered during 14 consecutive seasons from 
2001/02 to 2014/15 in a prospective cohort study 
known as the UEFA Elite Club Injury Study.1 During 
this period, a total of 57 professional European 
teams from 16 countries were included, all partic-
ipating in the highest division of their respective 
countries. All first team players from the included 
teams were invited to participate for a total of 2672 
included players.
exposure and injury registration
Individual exposure during matches was registered 
by a member of the technical staff. All time-loss 
injuries that occurred during these matches were 
registered on standard injury cards containing 
information about the occurrence and diagnosis 
of the injury (table 1). Injury cards and attendance 
records were reported to the study group monthly. 
The methodology of the exposure and injury regis-
tration has been described in detail previously.14

of days that had elapsed since the player’s last recorded match 
exposure prior to an observation (eg, if a player played a match 
on Monday and then played another match on Thursday, 3 
days 
had elapsed before the second match). Long-term match conges-
tion was defined as the total hours of match exposure that the 
player had been exposed to in the past 30 days prior to an obser-
vation (table 1).
First team and national team competitive match observations 
(excluding first team friendly, reserve team and under-21 team 
matches) that were preceded by at least 30 days of reported 
exposure not interrupted by any occurring injury or absence due 
to injury were considered eligible for analysis. In addition, there 
should not have been more than 10 days between an observation 
and the players’ last preceding match.
data analysis and statistics
All statistical analyses were performed using the Statistical 
Package for the Social Sciences 23 (SPSS, Chicago, Illinois, USA). 
Injury rate was defined as the number of injuries per 1000 
hours 
of match exposure. Match injury rates in different short-term 
match congestion groups (categorised as ≤3 days, 4 days, 5 
days, 6 days, and 7–10 days between matches) and rate ratios 
(RRs) between these groups were analysed with Poisson regres-
sions using match exposure hours as an offset. In these analyses, 
short-term match congestion was included as the independent 
variable, with ≤3 days serving as the reference category, while 
number of injuries and muscle injuries were used as dependent 
variables in separate analyses.
To investigate the influence of the duration of the previous 
match exposure, all observations were categorised in two groups 
(<90 
min or ≥90 
min of exposure in previous match) which 
were analysed separately.
Additional analyses were made for those observations where 
the duration of the previous match exposure was ≥90 
min. First, 
to analyse associations between long-term match congestion and 
injury rates, observations were categorised in low (≤4.5 
hours), 
medium (>4.5 
to ≤7.5 
hours) or high (>7.5 
hours) match

congestion groups. These cut-offs were chosen in conjunction to 
the number of full match exposures (1.5 
hours/full match) that 
were closest to the 25th percentiles. General and muscle injury 
rates in these groups and RRs between the groups were analysed 
with Poisson regressions using match exposure hours as an offset. 
In these analyses, long-term match congestion was included 
as the independent variable, with high (>7.5 
hours) serving as 
reference category, while number of injuries and muscle injuries 
were used as dependent variables in separate analyses.
Second, to investigate whether associations between short-term 
match congestion and muscle injury rates during matches were 
dependent on long-term match congestion, these associations 
were analysed in each of the long-term match congestion groups 
separately. Third, associations between short-term match conges-
tion and injury rate to specific muscle groups (hip/groin, thigh 
and lower leg) were analysed. These analyses were also made with 
Poisson regressions including short-term match congestion as the 
independent variable, with ≤3 days serving as the reference cate-
gory, and using match exposure hours as an offset. All results are 
presented with RRs including 95% CI.
All tests were 2-sided, and the significance level was set at 
p<0.05.
ReSulTS
A total of 133 170 individual match observations were included 
in the analyses adding up to a total of 166 433 match hours. 
During this match exposure, 4083 injuries were reported 
including 1561 muscle injuries (table 2). This yielded a total 
injury rate of 24.5/1000 match hours and a muscle injury rate of 
9.4 injuries/1000 match hours.
Associations between short-term match congestion and 
injury rates
There were no associations between total match injury rates and 
short-term match congestion. Muscle injury rates were 21% 
lower when there were 6 days, and 19% lower when there were 
7–10 days compared with when there were ≤3 days between 
matches. However, no differences were found when matches 
were separated by 4 or 5 days compared with ≤3 (table 2 and 
figure 1).
Influence of previous match exposure
When the observations were grouped based on the duration of 
the previous match exposure (<90 min and ≥90 min), similar 
RRs, with 18%–22% fewer muscle injuries when matches were 
separated by 6 or 7–10 days compared with ≤3, were shown in 
both groups. However, these differences were significant only 
if the duration of the previous exposure had been ≥90 min. 
In addition, a significant 37% reduction in muscle injury rate 
were shown if matches were separated by 5 days compared 
with 3 or less if the duration of the previous match exposure 
were <90 min (table 2).
Influence of long-term match congestion
No differences between general or muscle injury rates were 
shown when ≤4.5 hours or >4.5 to ≤7.5 hours were compared 
with >7.5 hours (table 3). When association between short-
term match congestion and muscle injury rates was anal-
ysed separately in these groups, similar RRs were observed 
with 17%–31% lower muscle injury rates when there were 
6 and 7–10 days between matches compared with ≤3 days 
in all long-term match congestion groups. These differences 
were, however, not significant except for when 7–10 days 
was compared with ≤3 days in the medium long-term match 
congestion group (table 3 and figure 2).
Injuries to specific muscle groups
Hip/groin, thigh and lower leg muscle injuries were anal-
ysed separately in match observations where the duration of 
the previous match exposure was ≥90 
min. These analyses 
showed similar patterns for hip/groin and thigh injuries with 
18%–22% fewer injuries when matches were separated by 
6 or 7–10 days compared with ≤3. These differences were, 
however, not statistically significant. Non-significantly fewer 
lower leg injuries were also shown when there were 6 or 7–10 
days between matches compared with ≤3. This reduction was 
larger than for other muscle groups after 6 days (33%) while 
it was smaller after 7–10 days (13%). In addition, statistically 
significant more hip/groin muscle injuries were observed when 
matches were separated by 5 days compared with ≤3 (table 4).
dISCuSSIOn
The main finding of the current study involving more than 130 
000 match observations was that the risk for professional foot-
ball players to experience a muscle injury during a match was 
significantly associated with short-term match congestion.
lower muscle injury rates after 6 days
If players were allowed 6 or 7–10 days between their match 
exposures, the muscle injury rate was about 20% lower than if 
they had ≤3 days. Similar, but non-significant, RRs following 6 
days or 7–10 days between matches were shown for hip/groin, 
thigh and lower leg muscle injuries. This is highly relevant for 
all medical practitioners working in professional football, and

corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) are presented using ≤3 
days between matches as reference category. Rate ratio > 1.0 indicates 
a higher injury incidence. Rate ratio < 1.0 indicates lower injury 
incidence. Significant difference is present if CIs do not include 1.0.

is in line with most previous studies in the field.9–12 Although 
the associations between match congestion and injury rates were 
found to be statistically significant it should be acknowledged 
that the individual player is still unlikely to suffer an injury in a 
given match even when facing a congested match schedule. In 
addition, there were no differences in injury rates in matches 
that were played ≤3 days after a previous match exposure 
compared with 4 or even 5 days. This finding is interesting since 
a rule change, which would allow teams to have at least 4 
days 
to recover between their matches, has recently been suggested.15 
The main argument for introducing such a rule is that it could 
potentially reduce injuries in the sport, but the current study 
suggests that a 4th day between matches would have limited 
impact on injury rates in professional football.
One possibility for teams to reduce short-term match conges-
tion for their players is a planned player rotation strategy. The 
analyses of players who had less than 90 
min of exposure in 
their previous match showed that they had fewer muscle injuries 
when matches were separated by 5 
days compared with 3 while 
there were no differences in injury rates after 5 compared with 
3 days for players who had 90 
min or more exposure in their 
previous match. This finding will offer some support that teams 
could potentially reduce the effect of short-term match conges-
tion with the use of player rotation and substitutions.
Traditional player rotation will, however, not be sufficient 
to completely protect all players from potentially harmful 
match congestion. One way to make player rotation strate-
gies more efficient could be to focus on those players most in 
need of recovery, and those most affected by match congestion. 
However, to date, there is no consensus concerning the under-
lying mechanisms for the associations between match congestion 
and injury rates in professional football, and several different

mechanisms have been suggested.2 Subjective measurements 
of well-being have been suggested to be sensitive in measuring 
both the load of athletes but also their reaction to this load and 
could potentially be useful for clinicians to identify players in 
need of rest.16 Whether or not subjective measurements of well-
being are also associated with injury risk needs to be addressed 
in future studies. It should, however, also be acknowledged that 
while subjective measurements may be able to describe training 
load, the best way to implement them are still under discussion17 
and possible effects of recall bias as well as questionnaire fatigue 
need to be considered when interpreting the results.17 18
Muscle fatigue: a potential mechanism
A possible mechanism explaining the higher match muscle injury 
rates during periods of match congestion is remaining muscular 
fatigue following a match. Signs of muscular fatigue after a football 
match or similar physical activity have been shown to remain for 
up to 72 
hours in several studies.3–6 These studies have all shown 
significant effects on muscle performance throughout 72 
hours 
of recovery after a match. In addition, objective signs of muscle 
damage and inflammatory reaction,3–6 as well as higher subjective 
ratings of muscle soreness,5 6 have also been demonstrated.
Studies have also shown that the biomechanical proper-
ties of muscles may change during and immediately after a 
match-simulating exercise resulting in lower maximum force 
production, lower muscle torque rate and changes in muscle acti-
vation patterns.19–22 These changes may alter player movements, 
subjecting specific muscles to activity levels/patterns that they 
are not accustomed to and thereby exposing players to higher 
injury risk. It is, however, not known how long it takes for these 
factors to return to preactivity levels.
Other potential mechanisms
A recent consensus statement about load in sports argues that 
load of athletes is a complex phenomenon which consists of 
physiological as well as psychological aspects.23
In football, studies have indicated that mental fatigue decreases 
the decision-making ability of players in match play situations,8 
as well as their physical and technical performance immediately 
after completing a mentally fatiguing exercise.24 It is plausible that 
a player with reduced decision-making abilities as well as physical 
and technical abilities will face more high-risk situations during a 
match such as receiving a tackle or being forced to sprint. There

are, however, no studies on the development of mental fatigue 
following a match and during the subsequent recovery period and 
no studies investigating mental fatigue during a period of match 
congestion.
Relationship between long-term and short-term match 
congestion
Long-term match congestion has been shown to increase injury 
rates in professional football.9 11 12 It has also been shown that 
muscle fatigue and signs of muscle damage following a match are 
greater when the recovery time between matches has been short, 
suggesting an accumulation of fatigue.5 Muscle fatigue and muscle 
damage could potentially make players more vulnerable to short-
term match congestion. On the other hand, in elite rugby, high 
long-term (chronic) workload has been shown to protect athletes 
from increased injury risk during short-term match congestion.25 
In the present study, no associations between long-term match 
congestion and injury rates were identified. While this is in contrast 
with a previous study using a shorter, more intense period of match 
congestion (6 matches all separated by 3 
days),11 it is in line with 
another study using a more similar definition of high match conges-
tion (8 matches in 28 days).13
In addition, when match observations were separated into 
low, medium and high long-term match congestion groups, 
similar RRs, with lower muscle injury rates after 6 or more days 
since the last match exposure compared with less, emerged in all 
groups. This indicates that the associations between short-term 
match congestion and muscle injury rates were not dependent on 
players’ long-term match congestion.
Methodological considerations
The study finds merit in that it follows international consensus 
about how to conduct epidemiological studies in football. The 
major strength is the large and homogenous cohort of profes-
sional football teams from several countries, with more than 
130 
000 individual match observations, which allows for a more 
detailed categorisation of the different match congestion vari-
ables than those in previous studies.10–13 It should, however, 
be acknowledged that even though the study included a large 
cohort, there were still relatively few injuries included in some 
groups in the subanalyses and the findings from these should 
therefore be interpreted with caution. The fact that most of the 
RRs in these subanalyses were found to be non-significant may 
also suggest a lack of statistical power.
A second limitation with the study is that the load during 
training sessions was not measured. In addition, match conges-
tion, as used in the current study, only measures the interval with 
which matches were played and does not take into account the 
activity level of players during these matches. There are several 
factors that may influence the activity level of players during 
matches. Previous studies have, for example, shown that playing 
formation, possession of the ball and the current score line of the 
match will influence players’ activity level.26–28 It is reasonable to 
believe that players’ activity level during match-free days as well 
as their activity level during specific matches might contribute to 
their level of fatigue, which could potentially be of importance for 
their injury risk. It should also be acknowledged that match-related 
factors that influence the activity profile of participating players as 
discussed above, and which have not been taken into consideration 
in the present study, may also have a direct effect on the risk of 
sustaining an injury during a match exposure.
Furthermore, only external load (the amount of work 
performed by the athlete) was considered,29 while internal load 
(relative physiological and psychological stress imposed on the 
athlete) was not included. A concern with measurements of 
external load is that they may only measure specific aspects of 
the load that athletes are exposed to, that is, match congestion 
in the current study. However, internal load measures are also 
needed to capture the full picture of the load put on athletes and 
how they react to this load. This issue is supported by data from 
cricket where measurements of internal load have been shown 
to be a better predictor of injuries than external load.30 Studies 
with more detailed information of the activity level during all 
training sessions as well as matches, and with a focus on the 
internal load might therefore be able to contribute further to 
the understanding of how load is associated with injury rates in 
professional football.
Finally, observational studies are always at risk of confounding 
factors. In the present study, some possible confounders have 
been considered by several separate analyses of different 
subgroups based on previous exposures. However, the risk of 
remaining confounders should not be disregarded. One possible 
confounder is that the selection of players before matches may be 
influenced by the short-term match congestion. This would mean 
that there, to some extent, could be different players included 
in the different short-term match congestion groups that were 
analysed which could potentially influence the results. A second 
possible confounder is that players’ long-term match congestion 
could be influenced by a previous injury. Even though we used 
an exclusion criteria saying that players could not have been 
absent due to injury during the last 30 days prior to a match, it is 
still possible that an injury absence prior to those 30 days could 
affect players’ long-term match congestion. It is plausible that 
players who have recently been absent due to injury would have 
lower long-term match congestion compared with players who 
have not been previously injured. A previous injury is an estab-
lished risk factor for sustaining a secondary injury31 and previous 
injuries could thus potentially influence our results.
COnCluSIOn
In this study of male professional football players, there were no 
match congestion-related differences in total match injury rates, 
but muscle injury rates during matches were lower when players 
were given at least 6 
days between their match exposures.
What are the findings?
 
► There were no differences in total injury rates depending on 
the number of days separating two matches.
 
► Muscle injury rates were lower after ≥6 days between 
matches compared with ≤3 days.
 
► There were no differences in total or muscle injury rates 
depending on players’ long-term match congestion.
how might it impact on clinical practice in the future?
 
► These findings may help guide technical staff in football 
teams when making decisions about players’ match 
congestion suggesting that player rotation may be of 
importance to avoid injuries even when matches are 
separated by 5 days.
 
► Remaining effects of a football match needs to be considered 
and monitored, and possible recovery strategies may be of 
importance up to 6 days following a match.
