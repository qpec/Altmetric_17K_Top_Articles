 with steric constraints from gp120, gp41, and glycans
at N88 and N625—effectively shields the con-
served MPER. Thus far, MPER peptide vaccines,
though immunogenic, produce nonneutralizing
antibodies, probably because of the lack of the
additional constraints provided by the trimer and
membrane (42, 43); our model suggests that the
minimalistic MPER epitope peptide presentation
may not be the most ideal strategy to elicit MPER
bnAbs. Overall, our data indicate that Env is a
pliable structure in which several of the protein-
protein interfaces can be remodeled, making it a
difficult moving target for the immune system.

Antibodies somatically mutate to attain high affinity in germinal centers (GCs). There,
competition between B cell clones and among somatic mutants of each clone drives an
increase in average affinity across the population. The extent to which higher-affinity cells
eliminating competitors restricts clonal diversity is unknown. By combining multiphoton
microscopy and sequencing, we show that tens to hundreds of distinct B cell clones seed
each GC and that GCs lose clonal diversity at widely disparate rates. Furthermore, efficient
affinity maturation can occur in the absence of homogenizing selection, ensuring that
many clones can mature in parallel within the same GC. Our findings have implications for
development of vaccines in which antibodies with nonimmunodominant specificities must
be elicited, as is the case for HIV-1 and influenza.
T
he average affinity of specific antibodies in-
creases dramatically over the course of an
immune response (1, 2). This phenomenon
is known as affinity maturation and is the
result of a Darwinian process that alternates
stochastic somatic hypermutation (SHM) of immu-
noglobulin (Ig) genes with the selection and clonal
expansion of B cells that have acquired affinity-
enhancing mutations (2). Successive iterations of
this cycle drive an increase in the overall affinity
of antibodies over time, which is essential for
their effectiveness in curtailing and preventing
infection.
Affinity maturation takes place in germinal
centers (GCs), defined microanatomical clusters
containing up to a few thousand B cells that
emerge in multiple copies within secondary
lymphoid organs upon infection or immunization
(3–7). Each GC is traditionally viewed as arising
from a handful of independent “founder clones,”
many of which are lost as affinity-based compe-
tition leads to progressive focusing of the reper-
toire on the most successful progeny (which we
refer to as “homogenizing selection”) (8). Although
it is inducible under experimental settings (9), the
extent to which homogenizing selection takes
place during normal immunization or infection
has been difficult to determine, mostly due to
technical limitations in the methods used to
measure clonal diversity within individual GCs
(10–14).
Measuring clonal diversity in GCs using
multiphoton microscopy
As an approach to estimating GC clonal diversity
by imaging, we made use of a “brainbow” allele
for multicolor fate mapping to permanently tag
individual B cells and their progeny with differ-
ent combinations of fluorescent proteins (15). This
method, as implemented in the Rosa26Confetti
allele (16), relies on stochastic Cre-mediated re-
combination to commit cells to expression of one
of four possible fluorescent proteins, generating
10 different color combinations when two alleles
are recombined in homozygous mice (fig. S1, A

 and B). Because recombination stops upon cessa-
tion of Cre activity, selective proliferation of an
individual GC B cell would lead to the appear-
ance of clusters of daughter cells of the same
color.
We generated Rosa26Confetti/Confetti mice carry-
ing the Mx1-Cre transgene, which triggers Confetti
recombination spontaneously during early life
(17). Multiphoton imaging of popliteal lymph
nodes (pLN) in naïve Mx1-Confetti mice showed
that, in the absence of immunization, cells of dif-
ferent colors are intermixed, as expected from the
polyclonal nature and migratory behavior of naïve
lymphocytes (Fig. 1A and movie S1). In contrast,
subcutaneous immunization with alum-adsorbed
chicken gamma globulin (CGG) induced the ap-
pearance in the draining lymph node (LN) of
clusters of cells of the same color, suggestive of
monoclonal expansion (Fig. 1B and movies S2
and S3). Such clusters could also be found in
mesenteric LNs (Fig. 1C), and even occasionally
in Peyer’s patches (fig. S1C) of unimmunized mice,
where GCs form spontaneously in response to in-
testinal microbiota. Thus, clonal expansions within
GCs can be readily detected by multicolor fate
mapping, even in cases where the driving anti-
gen is unknown.
Quantification of cell colors in GC dark zones
at 15 days after immunization (Fig. 1D) revealed a
wide range of color dominances (from 20.2 to
89.7%; median, 44.0%) and a relative paucity of
predominantly single-colored GCs [6 of 40 (15%)
GCs with color dominance > 70%] (Fig. 1E). To
validate these estimates, we used in situ photo-
activation followed by fluorescence-activated cell
sorting (9, 18) to obtain single B cells from indi-
vidual GCs, the clonal identity of which we then
determined by Igh mRNA sequencing (Fig. 1F).
This approach again showed varying degrees of
clonal dominance among individual GCs [3 of 12
(25%) GCs with dominance > 70%; range, 22.5%
to 87.5%; median, 43.0%] (Fig. 1G and fig. S2). It
also revealed the frequent presence of clones that
were shared between two individual GCs in the
sameLN, indicative of synchronousorigin (colored
slices in fig. S2). We conclude that GCs display
variable degrees of clonal dominance, even when
induced synchronously by immunization. Although
predominantly monoclonal GCs do exist, these are
relatively rare at the time point assayed.
Early GCs are highly diverse
The diversity of clonal dominance levels among
mature GCs led us to question the generalizabil-
ity of reports proposing that GCs are seeded
pauciclonally (11, 12, 19). To address this, we gen-
erated mice expressing the photoactivatable-GFP
(green fluorescent protein) transgene along with
Cre recombinase driven by the endogenous Aicda
locus (AicdaCre) (20), expressed in activated B cells,
and a Rosa26lox-stop-lox-tdTomato reporter. At 6 days
after immunization with CGG in alum, early
GCs were identifiable in these mice as clusters of

 tdTomato+ cells within follicular dendritic cell
(FDC) networks. We photoactivated two such
clusters per LN and sorted photoactivated GC
B cells from each cluster for Igh sequencing (Fig.
2A and fig. S3A). Early GCs were highly and uni-
formly polyclonal, with 23 to 46 unique variable/
diversity/joining (VDJ) rearrangements detected
when sequencing 34 to 77 single cells per GC (Fig.
2B). Extrapolation of these numbers using the
Chao1 and abundance coverage-based estimator
(ACE) estimators of species richness (21) gave
rough estimates of GC clonality that ranged
from ~50 to ~200 clones per GC (median Chao1,
102 clones) for the four pairs of GCs analyzed
(Fig. 2C). Overall mutation and class-switching
levels were low at this time point (fig. S3B), con-
firming that these were indeed early GCs. We
were again able to identify B cell clones that were
shared between two GCs in the same pLN (col-
ored slices, Fig. 2B) [mean 15.8% (SD 6.4) of clones
found in one GC were also found in its neigh-
bor]. Similar experiments using other antigens
showed that, although the extent of early GC
diversity can vary depending on the immunizing
antigen, high diversity is not a unique feature of
the response to CGG (Fig. 2D and fig. S3, C to E).
Diversity was also not the result of nonspecific
recruitment of B cells to early GCs (figs. S3C
and S4). We conclude that early GCs are highly
diverse, containing tens to hundreds of distinct
clones, depending on the antigen used for im-
munization. The progression from uniform di-
versity (Fig. 2) to variable degrees of clonal
dominance (Fig. 1) in the CGG response implies
that individual GCs display different rates of
homogenizing selection acting subsequently to
this coalescence.
Extent of homogenizing selection in
individual GCs
Clonal dominance in GCs may arise by parallel se-
lection of multiple members of a clone present in
the early GC or by strong expansion of single SHM
variants over cells of the same and of different
clones. To investigatethese dynamics, we generated
mice in which recombination of Rosa26Confetti was
driven by the tamoxifen-inducible AicdaCreERT2
allele, specifically expressed in activated B cells
(22). We thus delayed recombination until after
GC formation, allowing different members of the
same clone to express different color combina-
tions, each giving origin to an independent early
GC “lineage.” In this system, GCs dominated by
the descendants of a single SHM variant would
be identifiable as having “resolved” to a single
dominant color (Fig. 3A).
Administration of tamoxifen to Rosa26Confetti/Confetti.
AicdaCreERT2/+ (AID-Confetti) mice at 5 days after
CGG immunization triggered recombination, of-
ten of a single Confetti allele, in ~40 to 50% of GC
B cells (fig. S5, A and B) by the end of the 3- to
5-day period during which tamoxifen is active
(23). Recombination thus ends near the onset

 of T cell–driven selection, at the beginning of
the second week of the response (24) (Fig. 3A).
GCs analyzed 3 days after tamoxifen treatment
(8 days after immunization) displayed roughly
equal proportions of CFP+, YFP+, and RFP+
(cyan, yellow, and red fluorescent protein, re-
spectively) cells and a lower proportion of GFP+
and doubly recombined cells (Fig. 3B), as expected
from the original description of the Confetti al-
lele (16). Only residual, if any, GCs containing re-
combined cells could be detected in unimmunized
or alum-only control mice (fig. S5C).
Color distribution changed over time, with pro-
gressive emergence of GCs dominated by a single
color/combination (Fig. 3, B to G). To quantify
colordominance, we calculated a normalized dom-
inance score (NDS) for each GC, which approxi-
mates (25) the fraction of cells belonging to a single
lineage originating at the time of recombination
(fig. S5D). Kinetic analysis was extended to 15 days
after tamoxifen treatment (20 days after immuni-
zation), near the end of the CGG-alum–induced
GC response in most LNs. Median dominance in-
creased monotonically, from 0.16 at day 3 to 0.39
at day 15 after tamoxifen. GCs with NDS of 0.5 or
more (corresponding to ~50% of all GC cells dis-
playing the same color combination) appeared as
early as day 9 after tamoxifen, and a single color
could account for close to 80% of GC B cells at
day 11 and virtually all cells in a GC 4 days later
(Fig. 3F). However, progression among GCs varied
markedly, as dominance in the lowest-scoring
GCs at days 11 and 15 after tamoxifen remained
close to day 3 levels. Evaluation of color distribu-
tion in exceptional LNs in which GCs could still
be found at very late time points showed that low-
dominance GCs were present up to the very end
of the response (fig. S6, A to C). Therefore, GC
selection does not inevitably lead to high color
dominance within the lifetime of the response to
CGG-alum.
To determine the extent to which progression
of color dominance depends on affinity-based
competition, we generated an adoptive transfer
model in which wild-type hosts received B cells
from AicdaCreERT2/CreERT2.Rosa26Confetti/Confetti.

 NP hapten and do not undergo affinity matura-
tion due to lack of a functional Aicda allele).
4-Hydroxy-3-nitrophenylacetyl-ovalbumin (NP-OVA)–
induced GCs in recipient mice approached high
color dominance only rarely and with much de-
layed kinetics (Fig. 3, E and F, and fig. S6D).
Therefore, differencesinaffinity betweencompeting
B cells likely contribute toward the rapid rise in
dominance observed in a fraction of GCs. To
quantify the effect of neutral competition—
defined as the change in lineage abundances over
time due to stochastic factors, in the absence of
differences in affinity—in AID-Confetti-B1-8 GCs,
we calculated a divergence index, which computes
the difference between the expected and observed
proportions of all 10 colors in each GC (fig. S5E)
and is thus more sensitive to small changes in
color abundance than the NDS. This metric showed
marked divergence from baseline distribution in
this population (Fig. 3G and fig. S6D), highlight-
ing the effect on GC selection of factors unrelated
to affinity. Moreover, the least divergent GCs in
polyclonal and SHM-proficient AID-Confetti mice
remained relatively close to baseline color distri-
bution (at day 15 after tamoxifen, 25.7% of AID-
Confetti GCs scored below the median of the AID-
Confetti-B1-8 distribution) (Fig. 3G). We conclude
that individual GCs are highly heterogeneous
with respect to selection: Although a fraction of
these structures become heavily dominated by
cells of one color in a matter of days—suggesting
strong expansion of the descendants of a single
SHM variant arising at or after the onset of GC
selection—others deviate from baseline color dis-
tributionat levels that do not exceedthose attained
by neutral competition.
We extended our findings to a different anti-
genic system by measuring clonal dominance in
GCs elicited by infection with Friend retrovirus
(FV) (26). We treated infected AID-Confetti mice
with tamoxifen at 20 days after infection (an
early time point in the delayed GC response to
FV) and imaged spleen slices 10 days later (fig.
S7, A and B). A wide range of NDS and diver-
gence scores were also observed in FV-induced
GCs (Fig. 3H and fig. S7C). Therefore, heteroge-
neity in the outcome of selection is a common
property of GCs induced by model antigens and
by viral infection, and thus likely represents an
intrinsic property of GC evolution.
Homogeneous GCs are the product of
“clonal bursts”
To investigate the underlying clonal structure of
the variation in homogenizing selection rates
amongGCs, wedeterminedtheIghgenesequences
of fluorescent B cells isolated from GCs with dif-
ferent degrees of color dominance. To achieve this,
we dissected pLNs from immunized AID-Confetti
mice into fragments containing single GCs using
vibratome sectioning guided by multiphoton mi-
croscopy (Fig. 4A and fig. S8). From each LN, we
sorted cells from one high-dominance GC and from
aneighboringlow-dominanceGCforIgsequencing.
We obtained Igh sequences from 52 to 74 single
cells per GC from three pairs of pLN GCs harvested
10 days after tamoxifen treatment (15 days after
immunization with CGG-alum) (Fig. 4B and fig.
S9A). Comparison of SHM levels between high- and
low-dominance GCs from the same LN (fig. S9B)
and between Aicda-sufficient and haploinsufficient
GCs (fig. S9C) indicated that heterogeneity was

 not the consequence of asynchronous GC forma-
tion or of substantially impaired AID activity,
respectively. Most cells of the dominant color in
the three high-dominance GCs (Fig. 4B and fig.
S9A, left panels) derived from a single expanded
clone. In all three GCs, dominance could be read-
ily attributed to the selective expansion of a single
SHM variant, three to five heavy-chain variable
segment (VH) mutations (four to nine total muta-
tions) distanced from the unmutated ancestor
(UA) (dashed boxes in Fig. 4B and fig. S9A). Thus,
high-dominance GCs are predominantly mono-
clonal and appear to result from “clonal bursts,”
in which a single SHM variant is heavily ex-
panded over a short period of time, leading to
extensive loss of clonal diversity concomitant
with broad diversification of the expanded var-
iant. On the other hand, low-dominance GCs
(Fig. 4B and fig. S9A, right panels) were more clo-
nally diverse than their high-dominance neighbors.
Low color dominance is unlikely to be the result
of failure to identify a dominant nonfluorescent
lineage, because fluorescent and nonfluorescent
Bcellsobtainedfromtwoindependentlysequenced
low-dominance GCs were largely clonally related
(fig. S10). Although low-dominance GCs consisted
predominantly of small independent expansions,
one of three GCs sequenced (LN2/GC2) contained
alargerclone(accountingfor59%ofallrecombined
cells), within which multiple colors were repre-
sented. This expanded clone carried heavy- and
light-chain V(D)J rearrangements identical to the
dominant cloneinthesingle-coloredGCsequenced
from the same LN (LN2/GC1), indicative of a com-
mon cell of origin. In contrast to the clonal bursts
of single-colored GCs, however, this multicolored
expansion branched off from the Igh UA itself
and developed in parallel along several distinct
lineages. Thus, expansion of this clone began in
the pre/early GC period, before the end of the ta-
moxifen pulse, and subsequent competition in the
mature GC failed to focus on a single dominant

 SHM variant. Together, these data indicate that,
although clonal dominance in GCs can arise by
parallel expansion of members of the same clone,
loss of diversity is greatest in GCs in which strong
clonal bursts rapidly expand and diversify single
SHM variants.
Affinity maturation in the absence of
homogenizing selection
To investigate the relationship between clonal
bursting and affinity maturation, we measured
the affinity of recombinant Fab fragments derived
from B cells originating from high- and low-
dominance GCs (Fig. 4B), as well as from their
deduced or sequenced UAs. Fab affinities varied
markedly between clones, from undetectable to
low nanomolar dissociation constants (KD) (Fig.
5). As expected, the two Fabs obtained from
SHM variants that underwent clonal bursts
had higher affinity for the immunizing antigen
than their respective UAs [5.3-fold increase (1.0 ×
10−7 to 1.9 × 10−8) for clone 1.1 and 14.5-fold in-
crease (4.1 × 10−8 to 2.9 × 10−9) for clone 2.1] (Fig.
5). However, affinity maturation was also evident
in Fabs cloned from low-dominance GCs. Of the
three clones obtained from LN1/GC2, SHM var-
iants of two clones (1.3 and 1.4) showed increased
affinity over their UAs, whereas the affinity of the
third clone (1.2) remained below detection level
(Fig. 5). Clone 1.4 showed a gain in affinity of
12-fold (2.4 × 10−7 to 2.0 × 10−8), notably larger
than the 5.4-fold change observed for clone 1.1
(associated with a clonal burst in the neighbor-
ing single-colored GC). We also determined the
affinity of six additional variants of clone 2.1
from LN2/GC2 (which shared its UA with the
dominant clone of LN2/GC1 and is thus directly
comparable between GCs). Gains in affinity were
evident in all of these variants, ranging from 3.5-
to 13.8-fold (KD 1.2 × 10−8 and 3.0 × 10−9, respec-
tively) (Fig. 5, C to E). Although the highest of
these was close in magnitude to the 14.5-fold
change seen in variant 2.1M1 (associated with the
clonal burst in LN2/GC1), the increase in affinity
among GC2 Fabs was in general lower (median
increase of 6.8-fold). Thus, affinity maturation
can occur in the absence of clonal bursts, although
limited data from the two LN2 GCs suggests that
selection of high-affinity mutants in these cases
may not be as efficient.
Finally, detailed analysis of the SHM trajec-
tory of variant 2.1M1 showed that this burst was
associated with a somatic mutation in Igk
(C119→G, Ala→Gly) that alone increased the Fab
affinity by 7.6-fold (Fig. 5, E to G). This mutation
was also found to have occurred independently
at least twice in LN2/GC2, but without the ac-
companying burst. Thus, identical mutations oc-
curring within the same clone may still have
distinct outcomes when in different GCs, again
suggesting a role for stochastic factors in GC
selection.
Conclusions
Using a combination of imaging methods and
single-cell sequencing, we show that (i) early GCs
can be highly diverse, containing up to hundreds
of distinct B cell clones; (ii) individual GCs ap-
proach homogeneity at different rates, leading to
variable loss of diversity; (iii) homogeneous GCs
are the product of clonal bursts that lead to rapid
expansion and further diversification of SHM
variants with improved affinity; and (iv) affinity
maturation can take place in the presence or ab-
sence of such bursts and thus does not necessar-
ily require radical loss of clonal diversity.
We speculate that affinity maturation arises
through a balance between slow but steady elim-
ination of lower-affinity clones and variants,
punctuated by sporadic clonal bursts of various
magnitudes that generate a wealth of SHM var-
iants of a clone at the expense of clonal diversity.
This balance would ensure that the polyclonality
of the GC response is maintained at the same
time as very successful clones can be heavily di-
versified and exported to effector or memory fates,
generating the range of GC outcomes observed by
us and others (14, 27). Although it cannot be ruled
out that differences in outcomes between GCs
may be related to factors such as initial clonal
composition or timing of the appearance of key
mutations, the finding that GCs can deviate sub-
stantially from baseline color distribution even
when all cells have equal affinity and cannot
undergo SHM (Fig. 3, F and G, and fig. S6D) sug-
gests that stochastic factors unrelated to affinity
can strongly influence GC selection. A system in
which B cell selection is driven by dynamic en-
counters with a limiting number of T helper cells
would be especially sensitive to such effects (9, 27).
The explosive B cell proliferation that can be driv-
en by such encounters would provide a mechanis-
tic basis for the clonal burst phenomenon (28, 29).
The finding that early GCs can contain a large
diversity of clones is in contrast to the widely
held view that these structures form pauciclonally
(10–12, 30). Although this discrepancy may be
partly attributable to methodological issues (31),
Küppers et al. (13) reported higher clonal diver-
sity in one of two GCs originating from different
reactive human lymph nodes and speculated that
pauciclonal GCs were likely the product of exten-
sive selection acting on originally polyclonal early
GCs. Our current data strongly support this view.
Our findings have implications for the design
of vaccines against highly variable pathogens such
as influenza and HIV, where broadly protective
antibodies targeting conserved, nonimmuno-
dominant epitopesmust be elicited(32, 33). Under-
standing whether GC competition restricts the
appearance of such clones, and how clonal bursts
may promote the somatic diversification required
for broad neutralization to emerge, may prove key
to the successful generation of broadly protective
antibodies by vaccination.
