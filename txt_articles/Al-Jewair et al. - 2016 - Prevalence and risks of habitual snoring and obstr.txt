Objectives: To determine the prevalence of habitual 
snoring and risk of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) among 
dental patients and investigate factors associated with 
high-risk OSA.
Methods: This cross-sectional study was performed at 
the Department of Preventive Dental Sciences, College 
of Dentistry, University of Dammam, Kingdom of Saudi 
Arabia, between October and December 2014. A total 
of 200 consecutive female and male dental patients 
were included in this study. Subjective and objective 
assessments were carried out. Habitual snoring and risk 
of OSA were assessed using the Arabic version of the 
Berlin questionnaire. Two trained investigators carried 
out the objective measurements of anthropometric data, 
blood pressure, oxygen saturation, pulse rate, and clinical 
examination of upper-airway, and dental occlusion. 
Results: Habitual snoring was present in 18.2% of the 
females and 81.8% of the males (p<0.05). Breathing 
pauses during sleep of more than once a week occurred 
in 9% (n=17) of the sample. Of the males, 78.3% were at 
high risk of OSA compared with 21.7% of the females. 
Multivariate analysis for risk of OSA revealed that obese 
patients were almost 10 times more likely to report OSA 
symptoms than their non-obese counterparts (odds 
ratio: 9.9, 95% confidence intervals: 4.4-22.1). Tongue 
indentations, tonsil size, and a high Epworth Sleepiness 
Scale score were also independent risks of OSA.
Conclusion: Tongue indentations and tonsil grades III 
and IV were significantly associated with risk of OSA. 
This validates the important role of dentists in the 
recognition of the signs and symptoms of OSA.

O
bstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a repetitive 
complete or partial obstruction of the upper airway 
during sleep.1 It is characterized by snoring, hypoxia, 
hypercapnia, and arousals from sleep.2 Obstructive 
sleep apnea is found in 24% of male and 9% of 
female adults.3 Data from the Canadian Community 
Health Survey4 showed that approximately 26% of 
adult Canadians were at high risk of developing OSA. 
Two studies5,6 in Saudi Arabian population reported 
a 39% prevalence of OSA in females and 33.3% in 
males. Obstructive sleep apnea can cause tiredness, 
anxiety, depression, and is associated with diminished 
motor and cognitive functions, and reduced quality 
of life.7 The individuals with OSA have 2-10 times 
increased risk of motor vehicle accidents than those 
without OSA.8 Untreated OSA has been linked to 
systemic complications such as coronary artery disease,9 
heart failure,2 impaired glucose tolerance, insulin 
resistance, and dyslipidemia10 among other conditions. 
Unfortunately, most of the OSA cases (85%) remain 
undiagnosed,11 partly due to lack of information to 
patients and health professionals as well as the high 
costs of diagnostic tests. Several factors contribute to 
the development of OSA, which includes obesity, older 
age,12 male gender, menopause, hereditary, smoking, 
alcohol, craniofacial abnormalities,13 and periodontal 
disease.14 Orofacial anatomical abnormalities such as 
mandibular micrognathia or retrognathia, large tongue, 
hypertrophy of palatine tonsils, enlarged uvula, and 
deep palatal arch are craniofacial risks for developing 
OSA.15 Habitual snoring is one of the symptoms of sleep 
disordered breathing. A population based longitudinal 
study found that 13% of adults developed habitual 
snoring over 14 years. The factors associated with 
habitual snoring include male gender, obesity, smoking, 
and asthma.16 In addition, snoring is strongly associated 
with increased all-cause mortality.17 Dentists play a 
major role in the recognition of the signs and symptoms 
and the overall management of OSA.18 No data exist 
on the epidemiology or risks of OSA symptoms among 
dental patients in Saudi Arabia. This study aims to 
determine the prevalence of habitual snoring and OSA 
risk in adult dental patients and investigate the factors 
associated with high risk of OSA. 
Methods. This cross-sectional study was conducted 
on consecutive adult dental patients attending the 
dental clinics at the College of Dentistry, University 
of Dammam, Dammam, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 
between October and December 2014. The study 
was approved by the Committee for Biological and 
Medical Ethics of the Deanship of Scientific Research, 
University of Dammam. The study was conducted in 
accordance with the Helsinki Declaration. A sample of 
135 was estimated to determine the prevalence of OSA 
risk based on the study of BaHammam et al6 and using 
STATA version 13. To identify the factors associated 
with high risk OSA, we estimated 122 subjects to 
detect a 20% difference between high and low risk OSA 
patients and allow isolating 3-4 variables in a multiple 
logistic regression analysis with 80% power at the 5% 
level of significance. 
The inclusion criteria were adult female and male 
patients between the age of 18 and 65 years, who 
presented at the predoctoral and internship dental 
clinics for examination, or treatment. Patients younger 
than 18 years, had craniofacial anomalies such as cleft 
lip and palate, expectant women, and those unable to 
read were all excluded. Eligible patients were invited 
to participate, and signed informed consents were 
obtained. Subjective and objective assessments were 
carried out. 
Measures of snoring and risk of OSA. Subjective 
assessments. Patients were asked to complete a 
structured questionnaire that asked about demographic 
information (age, gender, educational level, marital 
status, housing condition, socioeconomic status), 
medical history and current medications, dental 
history and behaviors (brushing, flossing, and dental 
care utilization), and habitual smoking (defined as 
≥20 cigarettes per day). Habitual snoring and risk of 
OSA were assessed using the Arabic version of the 
Berlin questionnaire,19 which was previously tested 
and validated. The Berlin questionnaire20 is a 10-item 
survey in which questions are divided into 3 categories 
(category 1 [snoring], category 2 [fatigue and sleepiness], 
and category 3 [hypertension with >140/90 mm Hg], 
and body mass index). An individual was considered 
at high risk for OSA if he/she scored positive (≥2 
points) on 2 of the 3 categories. Habitual snoring was 
defined as a snoring frequency of 3-4 times per week or 
more.21 The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS)22 was used 
to measure daytime sleepiness. The ESS is an 8-item 
questionnaire that asks about the frequency of dozing 
during different activities and can range from zero 
(no dozing possibility) to 3 (high dozing possibility). 
The total ESS score ranges from 0-24 and a score of 
Disclosure. Authors have no conflict of interests, and 
the work was not supported or funded by any drug 
company. This study was funded by the Deanship of 
Scientific Research, University of Dammam, Dammam, 
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (#IRB-2014-02-185).

membrane. The NC was also corrected for height 
using the following formula: NC”/(5.5*height in 
meters+31)%.23 The BMI (kg/m2) was calculated 
and obesity was defined as ≥30 kg/mm2. Systolic and 
diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg) was measured with a 
digital sphygmomanometer. Oxygen saturation (SpO2) 
and pulse rate in beats per minute were assessed using 
a pulse oximeter (OxyTrue® S, Selmsdorf, Germany). 
Upper-airway examination included: tonsil size based 
on Friedman’s classification (tonsillar hypertrophy was 
defined as grades 4 and 5),24 modified Mallampati 
classification (moderate or severe if Class III or 
IV,25 tongue size (categorized into: normal, tongue 
indentations, and tongue-tie), size and shape of uvula 
and soft palate, and depth of palatal vault. The TMJ 
evaluation included the maximum opening (mm), and 
the presence of sounds and pain. The dental occlusion 
examination included the presences of enamel wear 
using the Basic Erosive Wear Examination (BEWE) 
Index26 in all sextants. Total scores were added and the 
risk of enamel wear was categorized into (no risk: ≤2, 
low risk: 3-8, medium risk: 9-13, and high risk: ≥14).26 
The occlusion variables also included facial profile, 
crossbite, open bite, angle classification, overbite (mm), 
overjet (mm), oral habits (namely, mouth breathing), 
and presence of mandibular Tori. The 2 examiners 
underwent a period of training and calibration with an 
experienced faculty member prior to data collection. 
The intra- and inter-examiner reliability were assessed 
and calculated using the kappa statistic for categorical 
variables27 and intra-class correlation coefficient for 
continuous variables and showed substantial agreement 
(between 0.70 and 0.98). 
A total of 234 patients were eligible. Thirty-four 
patients were excluded for different reasons.

Statistical analysis. Data were entered on an Excel 
spreadsheet, then transferred to STATA version 13 for 
analysis (Stata Statistical Software: Release 13. College 
Station, TX: StataCorp LP
.) Descriptive statistics were 
initially conducted. Independent sample t-test was used 
for continuous variables and Pearson Chi-square test 
and Fisher’s exact test (when appropriate) for categorical 
data. The risk of OSA was dichotomized into high or 
low based on the Berlin questionnaire cut off. Univariate 
analysis and multivariate backward stepwise regression 
were used to assess factors associated with the risk of 
OSA. The level of significance was set at 5% using 
2-tailed tests. Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test 
and the area under the receiver operator characteristic 
(ROC) curve were used to assess the validity of the 
multivariate regression model. 
Results. Two hundred dental patients were included, 
(n=154, 77%) of them were males (Table 1). Most of 
the patients were highly educated and in the low to 
middle income groups. Almost one third of the patients 
were obese (n=63). The neck circumference (NC)

measurements were significantly higher in males (40 cm 
±3.9) than in females (36.4 cm ±0.4) (p<0.001). Twenty 
percent of patients were taking medications for diabetes, 
hypertension, ulcerative colitis, hyperthyroidism, and 
vitamin D deficiency. 
Table 2 presents the distribution of habitual snoring 
and risk of OSA by gender. Habitual snoring was 
present in 17% of the sample and was significantly 
more prevalent in males than in females, (p=0.049). 
Breathing pauses during sleep with a frequency of 
more than once per week occurred in 9% (n=17) of 
the sample, of those 88.2% were males. Approximately 
42.5% (n=85) reported falling a sleep while driving or 
waiting. Twenty-three percent of the sample was at high 
risk of OSA (78.3% in males and 21.7% in females, 
p=0.817).
The clinical differences between high and low OSA 
patients are shown in Table 3. High risk of OSA was 
significantly associated with obesity, increased mean 
NC, presence of hypertension, habitual snoring, large 
tonsil size, and the presence of tongue indentations. 
Clinical differences were also compared between

habitual and non-habitual snorers (Table 4). The analysis 
revealed that weight in kg, obesity, hypertension, NC, 
ESS score, and tonsil size were significantly related to 
habitual snoring.
The multivariate regression model for risk of OSA 
isolated 4 variables (Table 5). Obese patients were 
almost 10 times more likely to report OSA symptoms 
than their non-obese counterparts (odds ratio: 9.9, 
95% confidence interval [CI]: 4.4-22.1). Tongue 
indentations and tonsil sizes III or IV were the only 
dental variables that maintained significance on the 
multivariate level. The Hosmer-lemeshow test was not 
statistically significant (p=0.4250), and the area under 
the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was 
0.823, both confirming adequacy of the fitted model.
Discussion. This study assessed the prevalence of 
habitual snoring and risks of OSA among adult dental 
patients. Habitual snoring is an important characteristic 
of sleep-disordered breathing. Approximately 82% 
of males and 18.2% of females in our study were 
habitual snorers. These proportions are different from 
the findings of BaHammam et al5,6 who reported that 
40.8% of the Saudi females and 52.3% of the males 
who attended outpatient hospital clinics were snorers. 
The differences between our study and the earlier 
studies can be explained by the diverse definitions of 
snoring used. Our study measured habitual snoring, 
defined as a snoring frequency of ≥3-4 times per week, 
while the previous studies5,6 measured the presence of 
snoring inclusive of both simple and habitual snoring. 
Twenty-three percent of the dental patients in 
the present study were at high risk of OSA (one in 4 
adult dental patients is at increased risk of OSA). This 
percentage is similar (26%) to the findings in a previous 
survey of 1506 adults conducted by the National sleep 
Foundation in America.28 The results however, were 
different from 2 studies on Saudis5,6 that reported 
39% prevalence of OSA in females and 33.3% in 
males. Another study reported the prevalence of sleep 
apnea and snoring among dental patients in America 
and approximately 33% of male and 6% of female 
populations had moderate to severe sleep apnea, while 
snoring was observed in 46% of males and 16% of 
females.29 
A greater percentage of high-risk OSA subjects 
in the present study were male. Bixler et al30 had 
shown that OSA is 3 times more common in male 
than premenopausal female, and 2 times higher than 
postmenopausal female. Gender differences have been 
attributed to several factors including differences in 
fat distribution, gender hormones, neurochemical 
mechanisms, and sleep arousals31 putting male at a 
greater risk of OSA. 
Consistent with many previous studies,32-34 this study 
found that obesity is the strongest independent risk 
factor for OSA with a 10-fold increase in risk. Peppard 
et al35 indicated that approximately 10% gain in body 
weight is associated with 32% increase in the symptoms 
of OSA, whereas 10% body weight loss can result in 
26% reduction in the severity of the disease. Obesity is 
a serious public health problem among all age groups 
in Saudi Arabia. The prevalence of obesity in adults has 
increased significantly from 22% to 36% between 1990 
and 2005.36 Al-Quwaidhi et al36 projected that obesity 
will reach 41% in males and 78% in females by 2022. 
Of the intra-oral variables evaluated, only 
tongue indentations and tonsil size were statistically 
significantly associated with the risk of OSA. Lee et 
al37 reported a significant predictive effect of tonsil size 
on OSA in 20-23 year old male Korean soldiers. These 
findings confirm the effects of upper airway anatomy on 
the occurrence of OSA. Although the tonsils decrease 
in size by adulthood, other factors such as obesity can 
modify the effect of pharyngeal soft tissues on OSA risk. 
Pharyngeal tissue size was found to be correlated with

body size among snorers and OSA subjects in a previous 
study.38 High ESS score was associated with a 10% 
increase in risk of OSA in this study. Daytime sleepiness 
is an important finding in OSA. It has to be stated that 
the ESS has a low predictive ability compared with other 
tests such as the multiple sleep latency and maintenance 
of wakefulness tests. These tests were not used in this 
study. Thus, this result needs to be interpreted with 
caution. Latest evidence from a large epidemiological 
study reported that the severity of OSA increases with 
age.12 This is contrary to the findings of our study that 
showed no significant effect of age on the risk of OSA. 
Similarly, hypertension failed to maintain significance 
at the multivariate level. Neck circumference was 
statistically significantly associated with high-risk OSA 
at the univariate level. However, this association failed 
to reach significance at the multivariate analysis. This 
is contrary to the findings of Davies et al39 that showed 
that NC corrected for height is more predictive of OSA 
than obesity. 
Study limitations. The risk of OSA was subjectively 
determined using the Berlin Questionnaire. Objective 
diagnosis of OSA with attended or unattended 
overnight polysomnography is important to confirm 
the prevalence and the severity of OSA. The sample 
in this study was over represented by males. It has 
been suggested that Saudi females have greater OSA 
occurrence than reported, as a result of the markedly 
increasing rates of obesity.6 More balanced samples 
are warranted in future studies. There is need for 
bigger samples with different age groups to confirm 
the occurrence of OSA and its severity in adults and 
pediatrics.
In conclusion, the prevalence of OSA symptoms 
was 21.7% in female and 78.3% in male adult dental 
patients. Obesity, increased tonsil size, presence 
of tongue indentations, and high ESS score were 
independent risks for OSA. Tongue indentations and 
tonsil size are significantly associated with risk of OSA; 
thus, this will take on the important role of dentists in 
the recognition of the signs and symptoms of OSA.
