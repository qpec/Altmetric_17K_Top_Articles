Significance of this study
What is already known on this subject?
 
► Testing for the presence of haemoglobin in 
faeces is widely used for colorectal cancer 
(CRC) screening.
 
► Faecal occult blood test (FOBT) positivity, a 
surrogate marker for the presence of faecal 
haemoglobin (f-Hb), is associated with male 
sex, age and deprivation.
 
► An incremental increase in f-Hb has been 
observed to be associated with increasing risk 
of death from CRC and all-cause mortality.
What are the new findings?
 
► Those with a positive FOBT result had a higher 
risk of dying from CRC than those with a 
negative result when adjusted for, gender, age, 
deprivation and prescription of medicines that 
can cause bleeding; this association held also 
for all-cause mortality excluding death from 
CRC.
 
► After again correcting for gender, age, 
deprivation and prescription of medicines that 
can cause bleeding, a positive FOBT result 
was significantly associated with increased 
risk of dying from circulatory, respiratory, 
neuropsychological, blood, endocrine and 
digestive diseases (excluding CRC) and 
non-CRCs.
 
► The presence of f-Hb confers increased risk of 
death from a range of causes in addition to 
CRC.
ABSTRACT
Objective An association between detectable faecal 
haemoglobin (f-Hb) and both the risk of death from 
colorectal cancer (CRC) and all-cause mortality has been 
reported. We set out to confirm or refute this observation 
in a UK population and to explore the association 
between f-Hb, as indicated by a positive guaiac faecal 
occult blood test (gFOBT) result, and different causes of 
death.
Design All individuals (134 192) who participated 
in gFOBT screening in Tayside, Scotland between 
29/03/2000 and 29/03/2016 were studied by linking 
their test result (positive or negative) with mortality data 
from the National Records of Scotland database and 
following to 30/03/2016.
Results Those with a positive test result (n=2714) had 
a higher risk of dying than those with a negative result, 
from CRC: HR 7.79 (95% CI 6.13 to 9.89), p<0.0001, 
(adjusted for, gender, age, deprivation quintile and 
medication that can cause bleeding) and all non-CRC 
causes: HR 1.58 (95% CI 1.45 to 1.73), p<0·0001.· In 
addition, f-Hb detectable by gFOBT was significantly 
associated with increased risk of dying from circulatory 
disease, respiratory disease, digestive diseases (excluding 
CRC), neuropsychological disease, blood and endocrine 
disease and non-CRC.
Conclusion The presence of detectable f-Hb is 
associated with increased risk of death from a wide 
range of causes.
INTRODUCTION
Testing for the presence of blood in faeces is 
widely used for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening 
and, several years ago, the four constituent coun-
tries of the UK established population screening 
programmes based on the guaiac faecal occult blood 
test (gFOBT).1 A test result positive for blood in 
faeces confers a high risk of harbouring and perhaps 
developing either CRC or its precursor lesion, an 
adenoma2 3 and it follows that an asymptomatic 
population of individuals with positive gFOBT 
results have a higher risk of CRC mortality than 
those who have negative results. In Taiwan, where 
population screening is conducted using a quan-
titative faecal immunochemical test (FIT), which 
employs antibodies against human haemoglobin 
(Hb) and provides a faecal haemoglobin (f-Hb) 
concentration estimate, an incremental increase in 
f-Hb was observed to be associated with increasing 
risk of death from CRC.4 In addition, however, a 
similar association with all-cause mortality was 
observed and this trend persisted after exclusion 
of all CRC deaths suggesting that the presence of 
Hb in faeces could be a predictor of life expec-
tancy independent from its association with CRC. 
However, the magnitude of the association with 
non-CRC deaths was not quantified, the non-CRC 
causes of death were not explored and corrections 
for gender, age and deprivation, all of which are 
associated with f-Hb,5 were not made. Further-
more, it was not possible to adjust for the use of 
medicines that could cause bleeding into the gastro-
intestinal tract.
In Scotland, gFOBT screening commenced in 
March 2000 with a demonstration pilot in three of 
the 14 NHS Boards charged with delivery of health-
care in Scotland on a geographical basis (Gram-
pian, Tayside and Fife) and a matched cohort study 
comparing these pilot areas with the rest of Scotland

Significance of this study
How might it impact on clinical practice in the foreseeable 
future?
 
► f-Hb might have potential as a modifiable biomarker that 
could be used to assess the efficacy of both lifestyle and 
prescribing interventions to reduce the risk of premature 
mortality and might also be used to explore the underlying 
reasons for different patterns of mortality in different 
populations across the world.
 
► A positive f-Hb could be used to alert those participating in 
CRC screening to the risk of reversible non-communicable 
disease, regardless of the presence or absence of colorectal 
neoplasia.
 
► These suggestions are currently speculative and 
require prospective studies using quantitative faecal 
immunochemical testing (FIT) for haemoglobin before they 
could be implemented.
demonstrated a 10% relative reduction in CRC mortality, rising 
to a 27% reduction when adjusted for participation.6 By linking 
the pilot screening data and subsequent programme data with 
the National Records of Scotland database, it was possible to 
study the association between a positive gFOBT result and both 
CRC and non-CRC mortality in the Scottish population. In addi-
tion, by linking with databases on medicine prescribing, it was 
possible to study the association between prescribed medicines 
and gFOBT positivity and to examine the confounding effect of 
such medicines on the association between gFOBT positivity and 
cause of death.
METHODS
Study cohort
The study cohort consisted of all men and women residing in 
the NHS Tayside Board area of Scotland, who participated in 
the Scottish arm of the UK CRC demonstration pilot (March 
2000 to September 2007) or the subsequent Scottish Bowel 
Screening Programme (2007 onwards). The age range for the 
pilot was 50–69 years and this was extended to 74 years for 
the Programme. The NHS Tayside Board area was chosen since 
it is possible to determine the history of community medicine 
prescribing for all residents registered with a general practi-
tioner (GP). The first screening test result available was used to 
classify individuals as having either a positive or negative result 
and they were then followed from the date of this test result to 
30/03/2016 or date of death if this was earlier. It is possible that 
some members of the negative cohort may have had a subsequent 
positive test result, but this could not invalidate the conclusions 
as it would serve to reduce rather than exaggerate the difference 
between the negative and positive groups.
For screening participants, a test result, defined as positive 
or negative, was obtained from the Bowel Screening Scotland 
(BoSS) database. Individuals were excluded from this study if 
they had returned their test kit for analysis but a positive or 
negative result could not be obtained, for example, if a test kit 
was spoiled. The screening algorithms are detailed elsewhere,7 8 
but were all based on an initial gFOBT kit (hema-screen, Immu-
nostics, Ocean, New Jersey, USA) sent by post to complete at 
home and then returned to the Scottish Bowel Screening Centre 
Laboratory for analysis.
Medicine prescribing
Information from the database of community dispensed 
prescribing was obtained from the Health Informatics Centre 
(HIC) at the University of Dundee. T
wo categories of medicines 
were selected which may have contributed to the presence of 
blood in faeces: (1) aspirin and (2) all drugs (including aspirin) 
that increase the risk of bleeding. The list of medicines included 
in the latter category were derived from the British National 
Formulary (http://www. 
bnf. 
org) and the relevant sections of 
the Formulary are given in table 1. Prescribing for any of these 
was included in the analysis if a prescription was dated in the 
16 weeks preceding the date of the screening test result. This 
time period was chosen to capture repeat prescriptions for those 
people on long-term medication with 2 
monthly repeats.
Mortality data
Screening data were record-linked to mortality data obtained 
from the National Records of Scotland database and anony-
mised before analysis. The cause of death used in this study 
was identified solely from the underlying cause recorded on the 
death certificate. No account was taken of potential migration 
from Scotland during the follow-up period and individuals were 
considered to be alive at 30/03/2016 if no date of death was 
recorded in the database. Thus, it is possible that some individ-
uals might have died outside Scotland, but this would be a very 
small number and there is no reason to suppose that the propor-
tion of such deaths would have been different in the test positive 
and negative groups.
In addition to considering all-cause mortality, the causes of 
death were recorded using the International Classification of 
Diseases (ICD 10) codes,9 and these were categorised following 
a format used by Whynes et al10 in a study examining cause of 
death in the Nottingham randomised trial of gFOBT. Non-cancer 
causes were defined as deaths from circulatory diseases (code 
I), respiratory diseases (code J), digestive system diseases (code 
K), neuropsychological conditions (codes F and G), external 
factors (codes S–Z) and diseases of the blood and endocrine 
system (codes D and E). Cancers were separated into CRC (code 
C180-9, C19, C20) and all other cancers (all remaining code C) 
were categorised as ‘other cancer’. Any remaining deaths were 
categorised as ‘other’.
Statistical methods
Cause-specific mortality rates were compared for the positive 
and negative test result groups. Person years of follow-up in 
each group were calculated from the date of the screening test 
result to 30/03/2016 or date of death, if earlier. Mortality rates 
in each group were calculated as the number of deaths divided 
by the person years of follow-up. Cumulative mortality rates for 
all-cause mortality, CRC mortality and non-CRC mortality were 
plotted by years since the screening test result for the positive 
and negative groups.

Cox regression was used to compare time to all-cause deaths, 
CRC and non-CRC deaths and also cause-specific deaths where 
there was a difference between positive and negative rates and 
sufficient numbers of individuals in the groups for such anal-
ysis. The outcomes were compared for positive and negative test 
results in both univariable and multivariable models. The latter 
were adjusted for gender, age and quintile of deprivation as 
defined by the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation11 since all 
of these have been shown to be associated with FOBT positivity.5 
In addition, the models were adjusted for prescribing of medi-
cines that increase the risk of bleeding, since this could represent 
a significant confounding variable. Proportional hazards were 
assessed using log-log plots.
All data analyses were carried out using STATA V
.14 (Stata, 
College Station, Texas, USA).
RESULTS
There were 134 
192 individuals who had participated in the Scot-
tish Pilot or Programme in Tayside during the study period. Of 
these, 271 were excluded from the study since they had no valid 
test result (120 had returned an incomplete test kit and 151 had 
a kit that had expired). Of the remaining 133 921, there were 
131 
207 with a negative test result and 2714 (2.03%) with a posi-
tive test result. The demographic characteristics of the cohort 
(table 2) show that males were more likely to have a positive test 
result than females and positivity increased with increasing age 
and increasing deprivation. They also demonstrate an increased 
likelihood of a positive test result in those prescribed aspirin or 
any medicine that increases risk of bleeding. Premature death 
was increased in those with a positive test result.
Logistic regression of the association between medicine 
prescribing and the other demographic variables demonstrated 
that prescribing of both aspirin alone and all medicines associ-
ated with an increased risk of bleeding was more likely in males, 
older people and in areas of deprivation (table 3).
Figures 1, 2 and 3 show the cumulative mortality from CRC, 
all causes and non-CRC causes of death respectively for the 
negative and positive test result groups. For CRC, as would be 
expected, those with a positive test result had higher mortality 
but, for both all-cause and all non-CRC deaths, those with a 
positive test result also had a higher mortality compared with 
those with a negative test result.
The log-log plots showed no significant deviation from the 
proportional hazards assumption for the Cox regression anal-
ysis. In the univariable analysis, a positive test result increased 
the likelihood of death from CRC and of death from all causes, 
all cancer causes excluding CRC and all the other more specific 
causes of death examined (table 4). There were small numbers 
for external causes, blood and endocrine disease and ‘other’ 
causes, but the results of the multivariable analyses are reported 
for completeness. It is interesting that, for external causes, which 
is made up largely of trauma, the relationship between a positive

Continued
test result and external factors as a cause of death did not remain 
significant when adjusted for gender, age and deprivation, indi-
cating that, not surprisingly, the association between mortality 
and test result was driven by these factors.
For all other cases, although the impact of a positive test result 
lessened slightly by adjusting for gender, age, deprivation and 
medicine prescribing, clear, statistically significant associations 
between the test result and mortality remained (table 4).
DISCUSSION
In this study, since gFOBT are qualitative tests that do not quan-
titate f-Hb, the effect of an incremental increase in f-Hb concen-
tration on colorectal (CRC) or non-CRC mortality could not 
be explored in detail. However, gFOBT, which are based on 
a peroxidase reaction that indicates the presence of the haem 
moiety of Hb in faeces, become positive at a f-Hb concentration 
of around 80 
µg Hb/g faeces.12 Previous work using quantitative 
FIT has indicated that around 60% of the Scottish population 
have detectable f-Hb,13 but only 2.03% of the study group had 
a positive gFOBT. Thus, by dividing the population into posi-
tive and negative test result groups using gFOBT, the positive 
group represents the high end of the f-Hb spectrum found in our 
population, very closely equating to the highest concentration 
examined in the Taiwanese study (90 
µg Hb/g faeces). When the 
Taiwanese data, at this cut-off f-Hb concentration, are compared 
with the Scottish data, the similarities in the cumulative mortality 
curves for both CRC and all causes (figures 1 and 2) are striking, 
indicating that the observed phenomena are transferrable across 
continents. Given that FIT is specific for human globin, it also 
indicates that the findings reported here are related to f-Hb and 
not to some other cause of peroxidase activity detected by the 
guaiac reaction.
The strong association between high f-Hb concentrations 
and CRC death is not surprising since the screening test posi-
tive group represents a relatively small cohort who are at 
high risk of having or developing CRC (about 10 times that 
of the background population)14 and not all screen-detected 
cancer is early stage. In addition, only around 85% of the 
gFOBT-positive individuals underwent colonoscopy so that 
there was potential for CRC to have progressed in this group.8 
The more interesting finding is the association with non-CRC 
mortality and, in contrast to the Taiwanese study, we were able

to examine this association broken down by disease categories 
and adjusted for confounding factors.
It is clear from this study that, in the Scottish population, the 
presence of Hb in the faeces as detected by gFOBT is associated 
with a number of non-CRC causes of death. Some of these may 
be associated with an increased risk of bleeding into the gastro-
intestinal tract, notably ‘other digestive diseases’, but others, 
however, are not. It is of particular interest that deaths from 
circulatory diseases, respiratory diseases and neuropsychological 
disorders were associated with the presence of Hb in faeces and, 
although some non-CRC cancers may bleed into the gut, for 
example, stomach and pancreatic cancers, most do not.
It is noteworthy that increased f-Hb is associated with increased 
male gender, age and deprivation,5 all of which are risk factors 
for increased all-cause mortality, but even after correcting for 
these factors, the presence of f-Hb retained a strong association 
with common causes of premature death. In addition, although 
increased f-Hb cannot be a cause of death, it may reflect the reason 
why male gender, age and deprivation are such strong risk factors.
Another explanation for this observation might be that people 
at risk of dying from circulatory disease are more likely to be 
taking aspirin or other medicines such as antiplatelet agents that 
could cause gastrointestinal bleeding than the general popu-
lation and certainly our data demonstrate that these are more 
often taken by the male, older and more deprived populations. 
However, correcting for prescribed aspirin and all medicines that 
could cause bleeding had little effect on the association between 
a positive gFOBT and death from non-CRC causes.
It is also pertinent that there is convincing evidence of aspirin 
reducing the risk of dying from several common cancers, 
including CRC,15 so that aspirin usage would be unlikely explain 
the association of faecal haemoglobin with cancer death. This is 
confirmed in a study from the English Bowel Cancer Screening 
Programme where, among individuals undergoing colonoscopy 
following a positive gFOBT result, current aspirin use was asso-
ciated with a lower incidence of colorectal neoplasia, possibly 
due to the chemopreventative effect of aspirin.16 Interestingly, 
a recent study has shown that aspirin does not modify the diag-
nostic accuracy of FIT for CRC and/or advanced colorectal 
neoplasia in patients with gastrointestinal symptoms.17
Thus, it would appear that the association between haemo-
globin in faeces and premature non-CRC death cannot be 
explained simply by its association with obvious confounding 
factors. An alternative hypothesis invokes a generalised inflam-
matory state manifested by subclinical colonic inflammation and 
consequent occult bleeding. It is well recognised that the ‘normal’ 
colon contains inflammatory cells in the submucosa, reflecting its 
constant need to eliminate organisms that breach the epithelium,18 
and it is likely that there is a spectrum of colonic inflammation 
across the asymptomatic population. It is long been assumed that 
colonic adenomas are detected by gFOBT screening because they 
bleed but, in contrast to invasive cancer, it is rare to see overt 
bleeding from adenomas at colonoscopy with currently available 
endoscopic techniques. Therefore, it may be that the increased 
risk of colonic adenoma in the gFOBT positive population is due 
to generalised colonic inflammation rather than bleeding from the 
adenomas themselves. This concept is supported by recent work 
on mucosal healing in inflammatory bowel disease, in which f-Hb 
has been found to be a better marker than the more traditional 
measure of gut inflammation, faecal calprotectin.19 20
Inflammation as a driver of non-inflammatory disease is 
well recognised. There is good evidence, for example, that the 
majority of solid tumours arise against a background of chronic 
inflammation.21 22 It is also well established that systemic inflam-
mation is a risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease.23 In addition, 
factors predisposing to ill health, such as obesity,24 25 sedentary 
behaviour,26 27 smoking,28 alcohol dependence29 and a Western 
diet30 31 have been shown to be associated with systemic inflam-
mation. Exactly how these factors might lead to increased 
inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract remains speculative, 
but there are some clues in the literature. For example, adipose 
tissue is now recognised as a highly immunologically active 
organ and chronic overnutrition induces marked imbalance 
in the immunological network that causes local inflammation. 
This, in turn, releases immune mediators into the systemic circu-
lation with inflammatory consequences for distant organs.24 In 
addition, physical activity has been shown to lead to increased 
concentrations of skeletal muscle derived IL-6 in the systemic 
circulation, which triggers changes in circulating levels of several 
other immune mediators that reduce levels of inflammation.26 It 
is therefore not surprising that studies of systemic inflammation 
have demonstrated a clear correlation with all-cause mortality.32
The colonic microbiome could also play a role in this context. 
It is becoming increasingly clear that ulcerative colitis (UC) is 
associated with a characteristic bacterial spectrum in both the 
luminal and mucosal compartments of the colon, but that there 
is significant overlap between patients with UC and apparently 
normal control subjects.33 Thus, it is possible that some people 
who do not exhibit the diagnostic criteria of UC, which include 
frank colonic mucosal bleeding, could have a sufficient degree 
of colonic mucosal inflammation for them to have detectable 
f-Hb. Interestingly, there is now good evidence that patients with 
inflammatory bowel disease have a higher risk of ischaemic heart 
disease than normal individuals and it has been hypothesised that 
an impaired intestinal barrier function (or ‘leaky gut’) could lead 
to enteric bacterial translocation and/or cytokine production that 
could, in turn, contribute to the development of both atheroscle-
rosis and heart failure.34 On the other hand, it is possible that 
microcirculatory changes in the gut associated with myocardial 
dysfunction could disrupt the intestinal barrier.34 Either way, 
there are reasons to suppose that inflammatory changes in the 
gut accounting for a positive gFOBT result might be associated 
with an increased risk of death from ischaemic heart disease.
The strengths of this study are the length of follow-up, the 
linkage with the National Records of Scotland which hold causes 
of death, and the unique ability to link with prescribing data that, 
in Tayside, have been collected for a sufficient number of years.35 
Although statutory mortality records have recognised limita-
tions,36 37 there is no reason to suppose that misclassification of the 
true underlying cause of death would vary in a systematic fashion

according to the gFOBT result. The weaknesses include reliance 
on the gFOBT results which cannot provide the quantitative infor-
mation now afforded by FIT and the fact that prescribing does not 
necessarily equate to adherence to medication and cannot exclude 
over-the-counter medicine usage. However, previous work in 
Tayside estimated that over 94% of aspirin tablets used are from 
filled prescriptions.38 Over-the-counter use of other Non-steroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs might be greater, but is very likely to be 
sporadic and very unlikely to be used long-term to treat potentially 
life-threatening diseases, especially in Scotland where there are no 
prescription charges.
The observations described here have three possible implications. 
First, if Hb in faeces is a risk factor for all-cause death, it may have 
potential as a modifiable biomarker that could be used to assess the 
efficacy of both lifestyle and drug interventions to reduce the risk 
of premature mortality. Second, it might also be used to explore the 
underlying reasons for different patterns of mortality in different 
populations across the world especially as the distribution of f-Hb 
concentration have been shown to vary geographically.39 Third, 
in gFOBT screening, the sensitivity for cancer is about 50%40 and 
about half of the people with positive test results have no cancer 
or adenomas in the colon8 (and this proportion rises if the cut-off 
f-Hb concentration used to trigger colonoscopy is lowered using 
FIT).40 However, a positive test result could be used alert invitees 
to the risk of reversible non-communicable disease regardless of 
the presence or absence of colorectal neoplasia.
It is true that the risk of dying from CRC with a positive gFOBT 
result is considerably higher than that of dying from the other condi-
tions explored in this study. However, CRC is a potent cause of 
early death and a 2–3-fold increase in risk of death from conditions 
that follow a more protected course indicates that there is a signifi-
cant burden of non-CRC disease associated with a positive test. To 
fully explore the significance of the presence of Hb in faeces, it will 
be necessary to carry out prospective population-based studies of 
f-Hb concentration using quantitative FIT to assess its association 
with lifestyle (including diet), health status and medication. It will 
then be necessary to carry out studies to examine the hypothesis 
that f-Hb concentration might be used as a meaningful index of 
the success of life-prolonging interventions based on, for example, 
diet, weight management, exercise or medication.
