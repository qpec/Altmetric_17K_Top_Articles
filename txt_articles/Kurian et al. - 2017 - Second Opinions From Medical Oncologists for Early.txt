Abstract
Importance—Advances in the evaluation and treatment of breast cancer have made the clinical 
decision-making context much more complex. A second medical oncology opinion may facilitate 
decision-making for women with breast cancer, yet little is known about second opinion use.
Objective—We investigated the patterns and correlates of second opinion use, and their impact 
on chemotherapy decisions.
Design, Setting, and Participants—A total of 1901 women newly diagnosed with stages 0 to 
II breast cancer between July 2013 and September 2014 (response rate, 71%), accrued through two 
population-based SEER registries (Georgia and Los Angeles County, California) and surveyed 
about their experiences with medical oncologists, decision-making, and chemotherapy use.
Main Outcome Measures—Factors associated with second opinion use were evaluated using 
logistic regression. Also assessed was the association between second opinion and chemotherapy

 use, adjusting for chemotherapy indication and propensity for receiving a second opinion. Multiple 
imputation and weighting were used to account for missing data.
Results—A total of 1,901 patients with stage I to II breast cancer (mean [SD] age, 61.6 [11.0]; 
1071 [56.3%] non-Hispanic white) saw any medical oncologist. Analysis of multiply imputed, 
weighted data (mean n=1866) showed that 168 (9.8%) (SE, 0.74%) received a second opinion and 
54 (3.2%) (SE, 0.47%) received chemotherapy from the second oncologist. Satisfaction with 
chemotherapy decision-making was high and did not differ between those who did (mean [SD], 
4.3 [0.08] on a 1- to 5-point scale) or did not (4.4 [0.03]) obtain a second opinion (p=.29). 
Predictors of second opinion use included college education vs less education (odds ratio [OR], 
1.85; 95% CI, 1.24–2.75), frequent use of internet-based support groups (OR, 2.15; CI, 1.12–
4.11), an intermediate result on the 21-gene recurrence score assay (OR, 1.85; CI, 1.11–3.09), and 
a variant of uncertain significance on hereditary cancer genetic testing (OR, 3.24; CI, 1.09–9.59). 
After controlling for patient and tumor characteristics, second opinion use was not associated with 
chemotherapy receipt (OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.71–1.52).
Conclusion and Relevance—Second opinion use was low (<10%) among patietns with early-
stage breast cancer, and high decision satisfaction regardless of second opinion use suggests little 
unmet demand. Along with educational level and use of internet support groups, uncertain results 
on genomic testing predicted second opinion use. Patient demand for second opinions may grow 
as increasingly complex genomic tests are disseminated.
INTRODUCTION
Advances in the evaluation and treatment of breast cancer have made the clinical decision-
making context much more complex.1,2 Options for all modalities of treatment, including 
surgery, drug therapy, radiation and reconstruction have markedly expanded, as have 
preventive options for women at high genetic risk for second cancers. This is particularly 
true for decisions about systemic therapies as patients now must consider choices about 3 
different medication categories: endocrine, chemotherapy and biologic. Examples include 
whether to take tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor, with or without ovarian suppression, 
and for how long;3–6 whether to take chemotherapy, with or without anthracyclines,7–9 and 
before or after surgery;10,11 and whether to take a new biologic agent such as 
pertuzumab.12,13 Moreover, diagnostic algorithms that guide treatment recommendations 
have become increasingly technical as genomic analyses, including germline genetic 
testing,14 are integrated into routine care.15–18 This complicated decision context can 
quickly overwhelm a patient seeking to understand her new diagnosis and choose a 
comprehensive care plan. Furthermore, most patients have only recently met the specialist 
physicians who are now in charge of their cancer care. Thus at the same time when she must 
deliberate between treatment options, a patient must also appraise the quality of one or more 
therapeutic relationships. These simultaneous demands may especially burden patients with 
limited educational, social or financial resources.19,20
Second opinions can facilitate treatment decision-making, and should be encouraged when 
patients are uncertain about their options or lack confidence in the treatment decision 
process. Given the growing complexity of treatment decision-making, second opinions may 
be an increasingly important opportunity for patients to gain confidence in their physicians

 and the proposed management plan. It is possible that a second opinion may indicate poor 
communication or care coordination, if, for instance, there are socioeconomic gradients in 
use, evidence of discordance in communication or decision-making, or differential use of 
indicated treatments in patients who do versus do not obtain second opinions.
However, little is known about how patients are referred to a medical oncologist after 
diagnosis and surprisingly, virtually nothing is known about the patterns and correlates of 
second opinions in community practice nor the implications for quality of care. Also 
unknown are the characteristics of the patient-oncologist encounter, whether related to the 
patient, physician, or clinical situation, that prompt patients to seek a second opinion. 
Understanding these aspects of treatment decision-making is necessary to inform 
interventions that can improve breast cancer care delivery and outcomes. We examined the 
patterns and correlates of second medical oncology opinions, and patients’ perspectives on 
chemotherapy decision-making and communication with oncologists, in a large, diverse 
contemporary population-based sample of patients newly diagnosed with breast cancer.
METHODS
Study Sample
We selected from the iCanCAre study women aged 20 to 79 years diagnosed with stages 0 to 
II breast cancer who were reported to the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results 
(SEER) registries of Georgia and Los Angeles County, California. Eligible patients were 
identified approximately 2 months after surgery via pathology reports from “definitive” 
surgical procedures (those intended to remove the entire tumor with clear margins). To 
ensure a relatively homogeneous sample of patients with early-stage disease, patients with 
stages III to IV metastatic disease, tumors larger than 5 cm, or 3 or more involved lymph 
nodes were excluded. Black, Asian, and Hispanic women were oversampled in Los Angeles 
as previously described.21 Patients were selected between July 2013 and September 2014. 
This studyw as approved by the University of Michigan Instituteional Review Board and 
received a waiver of written informed consent. All data were deidentified before research 
use.
Questionnaire Design and Content
Questionnaire content was developed using a conceptual framework, research questions, and 
hypotheses. We developed measures drawing from the literature and our prior research.15,22 
We used standard techniques to assess content validity, including systematic review by 
design experts, cognitive pre-testing with patients, and pilot studies in relevant populations.
Data Collection
Surveys were mailed approximately 2 months after surgery. To encourage response, we 
provided a $20 cash incentive and used a modified Dillman method,23 including reminders 
to nonrespondents. All materials were sent in English. We added Spanish-translated 
materials for all women with surnames suggesting Hispanic ethnicity.21 Each SEER registry 
provided limited SEER data (stripped of all identifiers) for participants to the University of 
Michigan: these data were then merged to survey data under institutional review board

 approval from partnering universities and the Public Health Departments of of Georgia and 
California.
Measures
Patients provided information about chemotherapy decisions, including how strongly the 
oncologist recommended chemotherapy on a 1- to 5-point scale (1, very strongly; 2, weakly; 
3, left it up to me; 4, weakly against it; 5, very strongly against it), whether they saw a 
second oncologist (the question was worded as “Did you see a second medical oncologist for 
an opinion about chemotherapy?” [yes or no]) and, if so, whether that second oncologist 
administered chemotherapy (yes or no). Patients reported their satisfaction with their amount 
of involvement and information about chemotherapy decisions (on a 1- to 5-point scale, with 
1 indicating not enough; 3, just right; and 5, too much) and the chemotherapy decision itself 
(on a 1- to 5-point scale, with 1 indicating not at all satisfied; 2, a little; 3, somewhat; 4, 
quite; and 5, totally). Patients rated their decision-making preferences on a 1- to 5-point 
scale (1 indicating not at all true; 2, a little; 3, somewhat; 4, quite; and 5, very) as follows: 
“preferred to be told what to do”, “wanted my doctor to tell me”, or “wanted to make my 
own decisions”. Patients rated oncologists on a 1- to 5-point scale (1, not at all true; 2, a 
little; 3, somewhat; 4, quite; and 5, very) according to the Health Care Climate 
Questionnaire,24 which measures perceived physician support of patient autonomy with 
questions as follows: “provided me with choices”, “understood how I saw things”, 
“expressed confidence in my decision making”, “listened to how I would like to be treated”, 
“encouraged me to ask questions”, and “tried to understand how I saw things”.
Patients provided information on the following: race/ethnicity, insurance, education, travel 
time to the nearest hospital, comorbidities, marital status, employment and household 
income. Patients reported on whether they received germline genetic testing for BRCA1 and 
BRCA2 (BRCA1/2) and/or other genes (yes or no) and results (positive, negative, or variant 
of uncertain significance [VUS]). Patients reported whether they received 21-gene 
recurrence score testing (yes or no) and results (low, intermediate or high). Patients reported 
on use of internet-based support groups (1- to 5-point scale: 1, almost never; 2, rarely; 3, 
sometimes; 4, often; and 5, almost always). SEER registries provided age (years), cancer 
stage (I, II), grade (1–3), and biomarkers including expression of estrogen receptor (ER), 
progesterone receptor (PR), and the erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2 gene/human epidermal 
growth factor receptor 2 gene (ERBB2/HER2).
We constructed a measure of chemotherapy indication according to guidelines of the 
National Comprehensive Cancer Network (eTables 1 and 2 in the Supplement).25 Patients 
were categorized as having a high chemotherapy indication if they had a tumor larger than 1 
centimeter (cm) and/or involved lymph nodes, and also had ER- and PR-negative and/or 
ERBB2-positive disease. They were categorized as having a low chemotherapy indication if 
they had all of the following: age of 50 years or older, post-menopausal status, and stage I, 
grade 1, ER- and/or PR-positive, ERBB2-negative disease. All others were categorized as 
having an intermediate chemotherapy indication.

 Statistical Methods
Weights—Survey design and non-response weights were created to compensate for the 
differential probability of selecting patients by race, stage and SEER site and to adjust for 
potential bias attributable to survey nonresponse. The weights were normalized to equal the 
observed sample size. Unless otherwise noted, all analyses were weighted so that statistical 
inferences are representative of our target population.26
Multiple Imputation—To account for item nonresponse and missing data, we multiply 
imputed data using a sequential regression multiple imputation framework.26 We generated 
5 independently-imputed datasets and then computed inferential statistics that combined 
estimates across the data sets.27
Statistical Analyses—We described the unadjusted association of second opinion receipt 
with patient and tumor characteristics and patient appraisal of care yielded by observed 
unweighted data. A total of 436 patients (22.9%) had 1 or more missing values. We then 
multiply imputed data, to which we applied inclusion and exclusion criteria to select an 
analytic sample (average N=1,866). We constructed a multivariable weighted logistic 
regression model to examine the association between the probability of second opinion 
receipt and SEER site, age at survey, race/ethnicity, comorbidities, education level, 
employment, insurance, household income, marital status, travel time to nearest hospital, 
germline genetic testing receipt, 21-gene recurrence score testing receipt, chemotherapy 
indication, internet-based support group use and treatment decision-making preferences. We 
estimated the effect of second opinion receipt on the likelihood of chemotherapy receipt 
using an inverse probability of treatment weighting28,29 approach, adopted to address 
confounding. For each patient, we estimated the propensity of receiving a second opinion. 
Weighting each subject by the inverse propensity of her second opinion receipt, we created a 
synthetic sample in which second opinion receipt is independent of patient characteristics. 
After examining the properties of the weights,30 we estimated the mean effect of second 
opinion receipt on the probability of chemotherapy receipt. In a separate model using the F 
test for multiply imputed data, we tested for the presence of a joint effect of second opinion 
receipt and its interaction with chemotherapy indication. All analyses were conducted using 
SAS Version 9.4 [Cary, NC, USA]. P<.05 was considered statistically significant (2-sided 
joint Wald test). Reported results were generated using multiply imputed, weighted data.
RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
We selected 3,880 patients diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer (mean [SD] age, 61.6 
[11.0] years), of whom 3,631 (93.6%) were eligible for the study. The survey response rate 
was 71% (N=2,578). We excluded 677 patients from this analysis (497 with non-invasive 
disease and 164 who never saw a medical oncologist, Figure 1). Table 3 in the Supplement 
indicates that the 1,901 remaining patients were racially and socioeconomically diverse: 
1,071 (56.3%) were non-Hispanic white, 306 (16.1%) were non-Hispanic black, 328 
(17.3%) were Hispanic, and 141 (7.4%) were Asian. For 1,160 (61.0%), high school was the 
highest educational level (Table 3 in the Supplement). A total of 1,194 (62.8%) had stage I

 disease, 518 (27.2%) had grade 1 disease, and 471 (24.8%) had grade 3 disease. A total of 
1,597 (84.0%) had ER- and PR-positive tumors; 211 (11.1%) had ERBB2-positive tumors 
(Supplemental Table 1). A total of 610 (32.1%) reported germline genetic testing and 716 
(37.7%) reported 21-gene recurrence score (RS) testing.
Factors Associated with Receipt of Second Opinions
Multiple imputation (mean n=1866 patients) yielded an estimated mean (SD) prevalence of 
second opinion receipt of 168 (9.8% [0.74%]). Figure 2 shows that factors significantly 
associated with second opinion receipt were a college education vs less (odds ratio [OR], 
1.85; 95% CI, 1.24–2.75), a preference for making one’s own treatment decisions quite a bit 
of the time or always vs never or sometimes (OR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.01–1.31), frequent use of 
internet-based support groups vs none (OR, 2.15; CI, 1.12–4.11), an intermediate result on 
the 21-gene RS assay vs not tested (OR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.11–3.09), and a VUS (OR, 3.24; 
95% CI, 1.09–9.59) or negative result (OR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.04–2.42) on germline genetic 
testing vs not tested. Odds of second opinion receipt were significantly lower in Georgia vs 
Los Angeles County (OR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.39–0.87), but there were no interactions between 
site and other model covariates. No other factor, including comorbidities, employment, 
income, or race/ethnicity was associated with second opinion receipt.
Receipt of Chemotherapy and Use of Second Opinions
Based on an analysis using multiply imputed, weighted data (average n=1866), 823 patients 
(44.0% [SE 1.2%]) reported chemotherapy receipt, with somewhat higher rates among 
patients who did (94 [52.1%]) vs did not (729[43.2%]) receive a second opinion on 
univariate analysis (OR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.07–1.97). However, several patient characteristics 
were correlated with both second opinion and chemotherapy use, raising concern about 
confounding. To test whether second opinion use had a significant impact on chemotherapy 
use, we used a inverse probability of treatment weighting model to control for differences in 
the distribution of characteristics between patients who did versus did not receive a second 
opinion, and thus to reduce bias from confounding. We found no significant interaction 
between second opinion receipt and chemotherapy indication on the probability of receiving 
chemotherapy (p-value=0.45): high indication (OR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.11–1.56), low 
indication (OR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.06–2.77), and intermediate indication (OR, 1.28; 95% CI, 
0.83–1.97). After controlling for patient and tumor characteristics, second opinion use was 
not associated with chemotherapy receipt (OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.71–1.52). Among patients 
who received a second opinion, 54 (3.2%) (SE, 0.47%) received chemotherapy from the 
second oncologist.
Patient Appraisal of Decision-Making and Second Opinions
Satisfaction with chemotherapy decisions was high and did not differ between those who did 
(mean [SD], 4.3[.08] on a 1- to 5-point scale) or did not (4.4[.03]) obtain a second opinion 
(P=.29) (Supplemental Table 4). Patients rated oncologists highly (mean score, 4.1 of 5) on 
the Health Care Climate Questionnaire, signifying perceived clinician support of patient 
autonomy (Supplemental Table 4).

 DISCUSSION
Second opinions may substantially affect a breast cancer treatment plan. Recent studies have 
focused on second opinions provided by one clinician to another: for example, reports that 
discordant reads in pathology and radiology change treatment in 10% to 25% of cases.30–33 
Tumor boards, which enable clinicians to synthesize a combined multidisciplinary opinion, 
are associated with improved care quality.34–36 We previously reported on the role of second 
opinions in surgical decision-making.37,38 Yet despite this evidence of impact, very little is 
known about the prevalence and consequences of second opinions that oncologists provide 
directly to patients.
In this large, diverse contemporary cohort, second opinion use was remarkably low: less 
than 10%, with fewer than 5% of all patients receiving chemotherapy from a second 
oncologist. There were regional differences, with second opinions less common in Georgia 
than LA. Reassuringly, we did not observe racial/ethnic or socioeconomic gradients; patient-
reported dissatisfaction with communication or decision-making; or differential 
chemotherapy use by patients who did versus did not receive second opinions. We conclude 
that there is little evidence of unmet demand for second opinions, and that their potential 
impact on chemotherapy decisions in community practice appears to be small.
Overall, our findings are encouraging with regard to the quality of breast cancer care. 
However, we identified key predictors of second opinion use that suggest opportunities for 
improvement. We observed a distinct profile of patients who were more likely to obtain 
second opinions. These patients were more often college-educated, more frequently used 
internet-based support groups, and preferred to make their own treatment decisions. Such 
patients may desire greater engagement in their care, and pursue second opinions for more 
information and support. This may constitute an appropriate use of second opinions; yet 
interventions that enable the first oncologist to recognize and address these patients’ needs 
may also be desirable.
Along with patient demographics and preferences, we identified a clinical predictor of 
second opinion use: uncertain results of genomic tests. Patients who reported having a 
variant of uncertain significance (VUS) on germline genetic testing were three-times more 
likely to obtain a second medical oncology opinion. These unclassified results may confuse 
patients; moreover, one study found that very few (<15%) physicians who order BRCA1/2 
testing understand how to manage a VUS.39 Oncologists confronted by VUS may struggle 
to explain them to patients’ satisfaction, prompting patients to seek another oncologist who 
can. While VUS rates are low (2%–5%) when BRCA1/2 are the only genes sequenced, they 
rise ten-fold (35%) with the multiple-gene panels that are rapidly emerging into breast 
cancer care.40–44 Furthermore, VUS rates are significantly higher in racial/ethnic minorities 
than non-Hispanic whites.45,46 Thus the demand for second opinions may rise with 
dissemination of more comprehensive genetic testing, and to a greater extent among 
vulnerable populations. This raises concern about future access disparities and emphasizes 
the need to follow trends in second opinion use over time. Studies are urgently needed to 
improve the interpretation of VUS and physicians’ ability to manage them.

 Patients with intermediate results on the 21-gene RS assay were two-times more likely than 
untested patients to receive a second opinion. While the clinical utility of low and high RS is 
well established,14,47–49 the appropriate management of intermediate RS remains unknown, 
pending results of clinical trials.14 A recent study of oncologists reported low “genomic 
confidence”: namely, the ability to use genomic testing results effectively for patient care.50 
Some patients may perceive their oncologists’ low confidence about treatment 
recommendations in the setting of uncertain germline or tumor genomic results, and seek 
greater confidence through a second opinion. This finding underscores the need for 
educational interventions that help oncologists’ knowledge and competence to keep pace 
with the rapid expansion of precision medicine technology.
Aspects of this study warrant comment. Its strengths include a large, racially/ethnically 
diverse, contemporary sample of breast cancer patients enrolled from two population-based 
cancer registries; specific measures of patients’ clinical decision-making; and a high 
response rate. Furthermore, weighting and multiple imputation techniques were used to 
account for potential bias due to missing data and to ensure that results were representatitve 
of the overall population. Its limitations include restriction to two geographic areas (Georgia 
and LA), so results may not apply fully to all United States breast cancer patients. 
Furthermore, the sample was selected for earlier stage (I-II) and had generally favorable 
tumor biology. The patterns, correlates and outcomes of second opinion use may be different 
in patients whose stage or tumor biology renders them at higher risk for metastatic 
recurrence. We have not yet validated patients’ reports of genetic testing, nor oncologists’ 
perspectives on second opinions and other aspects of treatment. There has been insufficient 
follow-up time to ascertain long-term outcomes of cancer recurrence and survival. 
Nonetheless, this study offers a novel and clinically relevant view of breast cancer treatment 
decision-making.
Conclusion
In an era of concern about the cost and value of cancer care, guidelines advise that we 
choose wisely before ordering diagnostic tests.51 Yet there are no guidelines as to whether a 
second opinion (with costs similar to those of diagnostic tests) is potentially valuable or 
merely redundant. Given the subjective and personal nature of the therapeutic encounter, 
second opinions may sometimes be necessary to address a poor fit between patient and 
physician. Encouragingly, we found high endorsement of perceived autonomy 
supportiveness of medical oncologists, with very few patients (<10%) seeking a second 
opinion and little evidence of an unmet need. Our results indicate that a patient’s preference 
for greater engagement is one predictor of second opinion use, and uncertain results of 
diagnostic testing are another. As treatment options proliferate and molecular diagnostic 
tests expand, physicians may face growing pressure to enable patients’ preferences about 
treatment decision-making and to navigate the increasingly murky landscape of genomic 
testing. These tasks demand effective physician-patient communication, and developing 
interventions to enhance the quality of such communication is a high priority.
