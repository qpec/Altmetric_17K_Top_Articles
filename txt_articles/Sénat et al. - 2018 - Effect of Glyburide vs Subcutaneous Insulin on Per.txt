IMPORTANCE Randomized trials have not focused on neonatal complications of glyburide
for women with gestational diabetes.
OBJECTIVE To compare oral glyburide vs subcutaneous insulin in prevention of perinatal
complications in newborns of women with gestational diabetes.
DESIGN, SETTINGS, AND PARTICIPANTS The Insulin Daonil trial (INDAO), a multicenter
noninferiority randomized trial conducted between May 2012 and November 2016
(end of participant follow-up) in 13 tertiary care university hospitals in France including
914 women with singleton pregnancies and gestational diabetes diagnosed between
24 and 34 weeks of gestation.
INTERVENTIONS Women who required pharmacologic treatment after 10 days of dietary
intervention were randomly assigned to receive glyburide (n=460) or insulin (n=454).
The starting dosage for glyburide was 2.5 mg orally once per day and could be increased if
necessary 4 days later by 2.5 mg and thereafter by 5 mg every 4 days in 2 morning and
evening doses, up to a maximum of 20 mg/d. The starting dosage for insulin was 4 IU to 20 IU
given subcutaneously 1 to 4 times per day as necessary and increased according to
self-measured blood glucose concentrations.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was a composite criterion including
macrosomia, neonatal hypoglycemia, and hyperbilirubinemia. The noninferiority margin
was set at 7% based on a 1-sided 97.5% confidence interval.
RESULTS Among the 914 patients who were randomized (mean age, 32.8 [SD, 5.2] years),
98% completed the trial. In a per-protocol analysis, 367 and 442 women and their neonates
were analyzed in the glyburide and insulin groups, respectively. The frequency of the primary
outcome was 27.6% in the glyburide group and 23.4% in the insulin group, a difference of
4.2% (1-sided 97.5% CI, −� to 10.5%; P=.19).
CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE This study of women with gestational diabetes failed to show
that use of glyburide compared with subcutaneous insulin does not result in a greater
frequency of perinatal complications. These findings do not justify the use of glyburide
as a first-line treatment.

estationaldiabetesisamajorpublichealthconcern,and
its rate is increasing worldwide.1,2 Adequate treat-
ment of women with gestational diabetes reduces fetal
and maternal morbidity.3 Insulin continues to be the American
Diabetes Association–recommended first-line therapy and the
only pharmacologic treatment approved by the US Food and
Drug Administration.4 The American College of Obstetri-
cians and Gynecologists recommends not using glyburide as
a first-choice pharmacologic treatment.5 However, insulin is
expensive and inconvenient because it requires several sub-
cutaneous injections a day and careful management of dose
adaptation.6 Glyburide is a potential alternative treatment
and, as an oral drug, is more acceptable to patients. Since the
first randomized trial by Langer et al7 showed that glycemic
control is similar for the 2 treatments, glyburide has become
a common additional pharmacotherapy for gestational dia-
betes in the United States,2 while in Europe it is not used
routinely. Meta-analyses8-13 and recent studies14,15 question
use of glyburide, reporting an increased rate of neonatal
morbidities compared with insulin, especially macrosomia
and hypoglycemia. However, because all randomized trials
comparing glyburide with insulin used maternal glycemic
control as the primary outcome, they were not optimally
designed to investigate neonatal complications.7,8 The aim
of the present study was therefore to compare glyburide
and insulin for prevention of perinatal complications, espe-
cially because the American College of Obstetricians and
Gynecologists recommends equivalence or noninferiority
trials comparing oral agents with insulin.5 The comparison
was planned as a noninferiority test because glyburide is an
oral pharmacotherapy for gestational diabetes and is more
convenient for patients, with greater ease of administration
and reduced costs.
Methods
Study Design and Patients
We performed a multicenter randomized noninferiority trial
(the Insulin Daonil trial [INDAO]) in 13 tertiary care univer-
sity hospitals in France. Recruitment lasted from May 2012
to September 2016, and November 2016 was the end of
patient follow-up. The trial protocol is available in Supplement
1 and the statistical analysis plan in Supplement 2. All
patients provided written informed consent before enroll-
ment. The trial protocol was approved by the ethics commit-
tee of the Poissy St-Germain Hospital. An independent data
and safety monitoring committee periodically reviewed
study outcomes.
Women with a singleton pregnancy who were diag-
nosed as having gestational diabetes between 24 and 34
weeks of gestation were eligible. Gestational diabetes was
diagnosed if a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test resulted in
1 or more abnormal blood glucose values: greater than
92 mg/dL (5.1 mmol/L), greater than 180 mg/dL (10 mmol/L),
or greater than 153 mg/dL (8.5 mmol/L) for fasting, 1-hour
postprandial, or 2-hour postprandial blood glucose concen-
tration, respectively.16
Exclusion criteria were diabetes, fasting blood glucose
concentration greater than 126 mg/dL (7 mmol/L), glucose
screening test performed before 24 weeks of gestation, mul-
tiple pregnancy, chronic hypertension, preeclampsia, and
known liver or renal disease.
Womendiagnosedwithgestationaldiabetesweregivenin-
dividual nutrition education by a dietitian designed to pro-
vide 25 kcal/kg per day for overweight and obese women and
35 kcal/kg per day for women at normal weight. Nutritional in-
take was divided into 3 meals and 2 snacks daily. Women were
taught to self-monitor capillary blood glucose levels 4 times
daily(fastingand2hoursaftereachmeal).Glycemicgoalswere
considered not achieved after 10 days of well-managed diet
if at least 2 blood glucose values above the targets were ob-
served over a week (fasting: ≥95 mg/dL; 2-hour postprandial:
≥120 mg/dL), with no variations in diet. Women who did not
meet glycemic goals were eligible for randomization to 1 of the
2 treatment groups.
Randomization
Eligible women were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to
receive glyburide or insulin. An independent, centralized,
computer-generated randomization sequence (CleanWeb,
Tele-medicine Technologies) was used for this allocation
according to a permuted-block method with block sizes ran-
domly chosen from 2 to 8, stratified by center. Clinicians
and participants had no access to the list but could not be
blinded to group allocation after randomization.
Procedures
For glyburide, the starting dosage for therapy was 2.5 mg
orally once per day and could be increased if necessary 4
days later by 2.5 mg and thereafter by 5 mg every 4 days in
2 doses, morning and evening, up to a maximum of 20 mg/d.
If the maximum tolerated dosage was reached without
achieving the desired glucose values of less than 95 mg/dL
(5.3 mmol/L) for fasting measurements and less than
120 mg/dL (6.7 mmol/L) for 2-hour postprandial measure-
ments, treatment was switched to insulin.
For insulin, the starting dosage for rapid analogs was 4 IU
given subcutaneously before meals, 1 to 3 times per day as nec-
essary and increased by 2 IU every 2 days according to the post-
prandial blood glucose value. If necessary, the starting dosage
Key Points
Question Does use of glyburide compared with subcutaneous
insulin result in an increase in perinatal complications among
women with gestational diabetes?
Findings In this noninferiority randomized trial that included 914
pregnant women with gestational diabetes, the rate of the
composite criterion (including macrosomia, neonatal
hypoglycemia, and hyperbilirubinemia) was 27.6% with glyburide
and 23.4% with insulin; the upper confidence limit of the
difference was 10.5%, which exceeded the prespecified
noninferiority margin of 7%.
Meaning These findings do not support noninferiority of glyburide
for prevention of perinatal complications of gestational diabetes.

 for basal or intermediate insulin was 4 IU to 8 IU given subcu-
taneously at bedtime and increased by 2 IU every 2 days ac-
cording to the morning fasting blood glucose value. Women
were taught to self-adjust their insulin doses in an effort to
reach and maintain glycemic goals throughout pregnancy.
All women had a clinical assessment with a visit to an en-
docrinologist at days 8 and 21 after randomization and then ev-
ery15daystooncepermonthaccordingtolevelofglycemiccon-
trol.Inadditiontotheseplannedvisits,womenreceivedprenatal
care at their institutions as deemed appropriate by their care-
givers (eg, general physicians, obstetricians, midwives). New-
bornmonitoringwasidenticaltotheusualrecommendationfor
newborns of mothers with diabetes, with early and frequent
breast or bottle feeding: from birth, at 30 minutes and then ev-
ery 2 or 3 hours. Neonatal glucose monitoring started immedi-
ately after birth and included frequent measurements (8 in the
first 24 hours and 2 on day 2). The number of glucose measure-
ments was increased when clinically required.
Outcome Variables
The primary outcome was a composite criterion of perinatal
complications associated with gestational diabetes, includ-
ing macrosomia, neonatal hypoglycemia, and hyperbilirubi-
nemia. Macrosomia was defined as birth weight greater than
4000 g or above the 90th percentile for gestational age ac-
cording to French curves.17 Neonatal hypoglycemia was de-
fined as blood glucose value less than 36 mg/dL (2 mmol/L)
after 2 hours of life.18 Hyperbilirubinemia was defined as the
need for phototherapy without another cause of jaundice.
The prespecified secondary outcomes included (1) neo-
natal outcomes of perinatal death, admission to a neonatal in-
tensive care unit (NICU) and neonatal ward, respiratory dis-
tress syndrome, birth injury, ponderal index (calculated as
[birth weight in grams divided by height in centimeters cubed]
times 100), pH level of less than 7, lactates in 3 categories
(<6 mmol/L, 6-9 mmol/L, and >9 mmol/L), and base excess
(not recorded); (2) maternal outcomes of glycemic control dur-
ing pregnancy (see below), hypoglycemia (defined as blood
glucose level <60 mg/dL [3.3 mmol/L]) and/or a symptomatic
episode of hypoglycemia with clinical symptoms of severity
(confusion, poor coordination, double vision, convulsion, or
inability to self-treat symptoms), premature delivery, mode of
delivery, perineal trauma, percentage switch from glyburide
to insulin, and maternal satisfaction; and (3) other outcomes,
dataforwhicharenotpresentedhere,includingnumberofpre-
natal visits, number of diabetologist visits, and hospitaliza-
tion days during pregnancy.
Glycemiccontrolduringpregnancywasquantifiedforeach
woman by the percentage of blood glucose measurements at
95 mg/dL or greater for fasting measurements and 120 mg/dL
or greater for 2-hour postprandial measurements. Three cat-
egories were defined (separately for fasting and postprandial
measurements): good glycemic control (<20%), moderate or
fairlygoodglycemiccontrol(20%-40%),andpoorglycemiccon-
trol (>40%). A satisfaction questionnaire was given to women
in the first postpartum week to assess treatment acceptability.
Additional outcomes considered exploratory were com-
ponents of the primary composite outcome, characteristics of
the newborn (birth weight, Apgar score, severity of hypogly-
cemia), reasons for admission to the NICU, mean insulin or gly-
buridedosagesreceivedbywomen,andsevereepisodesofma-
ternal hypoglycemia (defined as glucose level <40 mg/dL).
Sample Size
We estimated the usual frequency of the primary outcome
(macrosomia, hypoglycemia, and hyperbilirubinemia) in new-
borns of women with gestational diabetes treated with insu-
lin to be 18% based on published randomized trials compar-
ing insulin vs either usual prenatal care3,19 or glyburide
treatment7,20-23 and based on (unpublished) retrospective data
from the participating centers. The noninferiority boundary
was based on clinical evidence.24 We asked a group of clini-
cians to consider what increase in neonatal complications they
would accept in exchange for the potential benefits offered by
glyburide.25 They estimated that a 25% rate of perinatal com-
plicationsintheglyburidegroupwasacceptable.Glyburidewas
then considered noninferior to insulin if the upper confi-
dence limit of the difference did not exceed the prespecified
noninferiority margin of 7%. With these assumptions and with
a statistical power of 80%, a type I error of 5%, and a 2-sided
test, 372 women per group were required. With anticipation
that approximately 20% of patients in the glyburide group
would be switched to the insulin group,26 450 women per
group were necessary.

 Statistical Analysis
Continuous variables were summarized as means and stan-
dard deviations or medians and interquartile ranges if non–
normally distributed and qualitative variables as numbers and
percentages of participants. To take into account that the trial
was multicenter, mixed-effects models were used to com-
pare the 2 groups (logistic for qualitative variables and linear
for quantitative variables). These models were used to esti-
mate means and standard deviations or percentages in each
group and differences in means or percentages and 95% con-
fidence intervals between groups.
Primary Outcome
The analysis of the primary outcome was performed on the
per-protocol population excluding women who were switched
from glyburide to insulin treatment comparing the differ-
ence (glyburide rate − insulin rate) in the frequency of the pri-
mary outcome.27
Noninferiority of glyburide compared with insulin was
demonstrated if the upper bound of the 1-sided 97.5% confi-
dence interval of this difference was smaller than the prespeci-
fied threshold of 7%.
A prespecified sensitivity analysis for women who
switched treatment was performed on the intention-to-treat
population. A complementary prespecified analysis was per-
formed by adjusting for baseline characteristics that differed
between randomized groups.
Secondary Outcomes
Analyses of secondary outcomes and post hoc analyses were
made with superiority tests and 95% CIs for differences and
should be considered exploratory because no correction for
multiple comparisons was done.
No imputation was made for missing data because there
were only 2 missing data for the primary outcome and very
few for secondary outcomes. Complete case analyses were
done. The threshold for statistical significance was set at
P<.05 with a 2-sided test; for the primary outcome, a 1-sided
97.5% confidence interval was considered. Statistical analy-
ses were performed using Stata software, release 14.28
Results
Characteristics of the Women
Among 914 women with gestational diabetes (mean age,
32.8 [SD, 5.2] years), 460 were randomized to receive gly-
buride treatment and 454 to receive insulin treatment. After
randomization, 18 patients (2.0%) were excluded from the
analysis because they did not meet the inclusion criteria and
6 because they had no data for the primary outcome or re-
fused the treatment (Figure). Among the 448 women remain-
ing in the glyburide group, 81 (18%) were switched to insulin,
most often before reaching the maximum glyburide dosage.
The per-protocol analysis therefore included 809 women and
their neonates, 367 in the glyburide group and 442 in the in-
sulin group (Figure).
The baseline characteristics of the 809 included women
are shown in Table 1. Overall, there were no noticeable
between-group differences in demographic variables or
blood glucose values at inclusion. Multiparity was more fre-
quent in the insulin group (66.3% vs 58.9%), and gestational
age at treatment was slightly greater in the glyburide group.
Primary Outcome
The frequency of the primary outcome was 27.6% in the
glyburide group and 23.4% in the insulin group (differ-
ence, 4.2%; 1-sided 97.5% CI, −� to 10.5%; P = .19), and the
upper confidence limit exceeded the noninferiority mar-
gin of 7% (Table 2). When adjusted for multiparity and gesta-
tional age at treatment, the results remained similar (differ-
ence, 4.4%; 1-sided 97.5% CI, −� to 10.5%; P = .20) (eFigure in
Supplement 3).

Prespecified Secondary Neonatal Outcomes
No perinatal deaths occurred in the glyburide group, and
there were 2 in the insulin group (1 patient with unexplained
intrauterine death at 40 weeks of gestation with birth of
an infant weighing 3400 g; 1 medical termination of preg-
nancy performed at 36 weeks of gestation because of severe
brain abnormalities).
The rates of admission to an NICU and neonatal nursery
did not differ significantly in the 2 groups. There were no sig-
nificant between-group differences in birth injury, ponderal
index, pH level of less than 7, lactate levels, and respiratory
distress syndrome (Table 2).

 Prespecified Secondary Maternal Outcomes
Blood glucose control was significantly better during preg-
nancy in the glyburide group, with 71.7% of women main-
taining good fasting glycemic control compared with 63.2%
in the insulin group (difference, 8.5%; 95% CI, 1.9%-15.2%;
P = .003) (Table 2). Good control of postprandial glucose was
achieved in 57.8% of women in the glyburide group and
49.3% in the insulin group (difference, 8.5%; 95% CI, 1.5%-
15.6%; P = .051).
More women in the glyburide group had at least 1 epi-
sode of fasting or postprandial glycemia (blood glucose
<60 mg/dL) during pregnancy (glyburide group, 93 [28.8%]
vs insulin group, 13 [3.5%]; difference, 25.3%; 95% CI, 16.6%-
34.0%; P < .001). There were no significant between-group
differences in mode of delivery, preterm delivery, and peri-
neal trauma. Overall, 68.5% of women completed the satis-
faction questionnaire during their maternity stay. There was
no significant relationship between nonresponse and the
composite criterion (P = .82). In terms of maternal satisfac-
tion, 23.6% of patients in the insulin group indicated that
therapy is the most difficult part of the treatment, whereas
only 5% did in the glyburide group (P < .001). Among women
treated with glyburide, 78.7% indicated that they would
choose glyburide treatment in a subsequent pregnancy,
whereas only 19.9% of women treated with insulin would
choose insulin again (P < .001) (Table 2).
Post Hoc Analyses
Per-protocol analysis results for the components of the com-
posite criterion are given in Table 3 (and in eTable 2 in
Supplement 3 for the intention-to-treat analysis). Hypoglyce-
mia occurred in 12.2% of the glyburide group and in 7.2% of
the insulin group (difference, 5%; 95% CI, 0.5%-9.5%; P = .02).
There were no significant between-group differences in mac-
rosomia and hyperbilirubinemia rates.
Severity of hypoglycemia among newborns did not differ
significantly between the groups, with blood glucose levels of
1 mmol/L or lower among 2 newborns in the glyburide group
and 3 newborns in the insulin group. No neonate presented
with severe clinical signs of hypoglycemia. Among newborns
admitted to the NICU, none were admitted because of clinical
signs of hypoglycemia or for treatment of hypoglycemia.
More women in the glyburide group had a severe hypo-
glycemia episode (blood glucose level <40 mg/dL: 13 [3.8%]
in the glyburide group vs 4 [1.0%] in the insulin group; differ-
ence, 2.8%; 95% CI, 0.2%-5.5%; P = .02). Among them,
2 women in the glyburide group and 1 woman in the insulin
group reported symptoms with an inability to self-treat
their symptoms.
Discussion
This study of women with gestational diabetes failed to show
that use of glyburide compared with subcutaneous insulin
does not result in a greater frequency of perinatal complica-
tions. These findings do not justify use of glyburide as a first-
line treatment.
The higher rate of the primary outcome in the glyburide
group was mainly due to an increased rate of neonatal hypo-
glycemia. This is consistent with results of meta-analyses
including observational studies and randomized trials.8-13
However, most of these meta-analyses also mention a signifi-
cantly increased risk of macrosomia8,9,11 in neonates of
women treated with glyburide, and 2 studies using large
administrative databases have additionally reported an
increased risk of respiratory distress syndrome and NICU
admissions with glyburide.14,15 These findings are not consis-
tent with the results, albeit exploratory, reported in Table 3,
because no significant between-group differences were
found in the rates of macrosomia, hyperbilirubinemia,
admission to the NICU or neonatal nursery, or respiratory dis-
tress syndrome. An isolated increase in neonatal hypoglyce-
mia in the glyburide group is in agreement with data from the

 latest meta-analysis comparing management of gestational
diabetes with glyburide vs insulin.12 The rate of neonatal
hypoglycemia in the glyburide group was 12.2%, which is of
the same magnitude as the 9% reported by Langer et al7 in
their insulin group but much lower than the 33% reported by
Bertini et al21 and the 25% reported by Silva et al23 in their
glyburide groups. A prospective cohort study involving neo-
nates considered to be at risk of hypoglycemia, including
40% of neonates born to a mother with diabetes, showed
that with an on-treatment blood glucose level threshold of
47 mg/dL (2.6 mmol/L), neonatal hypoglycemia was not asso-
ciated with adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes at 2 years
compared with neonates with normal glucose levels.29
Because women had gestational diabetes, study physi-
cians knew the infants were at risk of hypoglycemia, and neo-
natal glucose was monitored frequently after birth, so it is un-
likely that there were neonates with unrecognized and
untreated hypoglycemia. The 18% glyburide-to-insulin switch
rate is consistent with literature reports.26
Thestrengthsofthepresentstudyincludethatitwasamul-
ticenter study, which increases its generalizability. In addi-
tion, a neonatal criterion was chosen as the primary outcome
because,toourknowledge,nopreviousrandomizedtrialshave
optimally assessed the potential effect of glyburide on pre-
vention of perinatal complications.7,20-23
Limitations
This study had several limitations. First, some criteria were not
prespecified in the initial protocol, such as the components of
the primary outcome or the reason for admission to the NICU,
and these must therefore be considered as exploratory or post
hoc analyses and are of reduced weight. Second, criteria cho-
sen to assess satisfaction in terms of women’
s treatment pref-
erences for a future pregnancy may be questioned, inasmuch
as each woman received only 1 of the 2 treatments and had no
experiential basis for making such a comparison.
The noninferiority framework provides, on one hand, a bi-
nary conclusion (significant or not) and, on the other hand, a
more quantitative result with the boundaries of the 95% con-
fidence interval.30
Although the data do not allow a conclusion that gly-
buride is not inferior to insulin in the prevention of perinatal
complications, the results suggest that the increase in com-
plications may be no more than 10.5% compared with insu-
lin. This result should be balanced with the ease of use and bet-
ter satisfaction with glyburide. In clinical situations in which
an oral agent may be necessary, mothers, informed by their
physicians, would be appropriate decision makers based on
their own weighing of benefits and risks.
Conclusions
This study of women with gestational diabetes failed to show
thatuseofglyburidecomparedwithsubcutaneousinsulindoes
not result in a greater frequency of perinatal complications.
These findings do not justify the use of glyburide as a first-
line treatment.
