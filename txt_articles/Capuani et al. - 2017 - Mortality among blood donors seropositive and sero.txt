Abstract
Background
Individuals in the indeterminate phase of Chagas disease are considered to have mortality
rates similar to those of the overall population. This study compares mortality rates among
blood donors seropositive for Chagas disease and negative controls in the city of São
Paulo, Brazil.
Methodology/principal findings
This is a retrospective cohort study of blood donors from 1996 to 2000: 2842 seropositive
and 5684 seronegative for Chagas disease. Death status was ascertained by performing
probabilistic record linkage (RL) with the Brazil national mortality information system (SIM).
RL was assessed in a previous validation study. Cox Regression was used to derive hazard
ratios (HR), adjusting for confounders. RL identified 159 deaths among the 2842 seroposi-
tive blood donors (5.6%) and 103 deaths among the 5684 seronegative (1.8%). Out of the
159 deaths among seropositive donors, 26 had the 10th International Statistical Classifica-
tion of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10) indicating Chagas disease as the
underlying cause of death (B57.0/B57.5), 23 had ICD-10 codes (I42.0/I42.2/I47.0/I47.2/
I49.0/I50.0/I50.1/ I50.9/I51.7) indicating cardiac abnormalities possibly related to Chagas
disease listed as an underlying or associated cause of death, with the others having no men-
tion of Chagas disease in part I of the death certificate. Donors seropositive for Chagas

 disease had a 2.3 times higher risk of death due to all causes (95% Confidence Interval
(95% CI), 1.8–3.0) than seronegative donors. When considering deaths due to Chagas dis-
ease or those that had underlying causes of cardiac abnormalities related to Chagas dis-
ease, seropositive donors had a risk of death 17.9 (95% CI, 6.3–50.8) times greater than
seronegative donors.
Conclusions/significance
There is an excess risk of death in donors seropositive blood for Chagas disease compared
to seronegative donors. Chagas disease is an under-reported cause of death in the Brazilian
mortality database.
Author summary
Chagas disease is classified as one of the 17 most important neglected diseases by the
World Health Organization (WHO). The majority of infected individuals live in 21
countries of Central and South America. Estimates of mortality attributable to Chagas
disease vary considerably (between 0.2% and 19.2% annually). To improve the measure-
ment of disease burden and policy decision-making in regard to treatment availability,
more accurate estimates of mortality, especially among otherwise asymptomatic seroposi-
tive individuals are needed,. This study compares mortality rates and causes of death of
asymptomatic blood donors who tested seropositive for Chagas disease and seronegative
for all screening tests conducted in Brazil. Mortality status was ascertained by linking
donor names with the Brazilian national mortality information system (SIM). The study
found that donors who tested Chagas disease seropositive had risk of death from all causes
2.3 (95% CI, 1.8–3.0) times greater than seronegative ones. The data also suggest that the
SIM may underestimate the total number of deaths attributable to Chagas disease in
Brazil.
Introduction
Chagas disease was first described in 1909 by the Brazilian scientist Carlos Ribeiro Justiniano
Chagas (1879–1934). The etiologic agent that causes Chagas disease is the protozoan parasite
Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi). The parasite is transmitted by the reduviid bug, a member of the
Triatomine subfamily, popularly known as the “kissing bug”. Transmission may also occur by
blood or organ transfusion, contaminated food, from mother to child and due to laboratory
accidents [1]. Classified as one of the 17 most important neglected diseases by the World
Health Organization (WHO), estimates of the number of infected individuals in the world
have decreased from approximately 20 million in 1981 [1], to 7–8 million in 2014 [2].
In Brazil, from 1980 to 2000 there was a great effort by health authorities to eradicate the
insect and to stop transfusion transmission. The reduction in disease burden is predominantly
a result of improved vector control. The main measures of disease control implemented were
the elimination of Triatoma infestans peri and in-house habitat by the use of insecticides, hous-
ing stock improvement, sanitary education, and the adoption of screening tests among blood
donors to detect the parasite and thus avoid transmission [3]. Donor screening for T cruzi is
mandatory in all Latin American countries with more than 92% of screening coverage of the

 blood supply.[4] The prevalence of T cruzi has declined among first time blood donors in Bra-
zil, from 0.52% in 1996 [5] to 0.14% in 2008 [6].
In humans, Chagas disease manifests in two phases, acute and chronic. The acute phase
has mild symptoms that may last for approximately two months. In the chronic phase, the
majority of cases are of the asymptomatic indeterminate form, which may last a lifetime. Indi-
viduals in the chronic phase of the disease with normal electrocardiogram (EKG) and normal
chest and esophagus X-rays are considered individuals in the indeterminate form of the dis-
ease [7]. Whereas, clinically apparent chronic disease form is divided into a cardiac, gastroin-
testinal, or combined form [8]. The most important health consequence of Chagas disease is
cardiomyopathy, which over a lifetime occurs in 20–40% of infected persons with an incidence
rate of 1.85% per person-year [9]. In Brazil, it is estimated that in 2013 there were 2 to 3 million
infected individuals [10], of which 600,000 had cardiac and/or gastrointestinal complications.
The disease is also responsible for approximately 6,000 deaths per year in Brazil, i.e. 0.6% of
all deaths that occur in the country [11]. This estimate is based on analyses of data from the
National Mortality Information System (SIM) from 1999 to 2007, in which records with 10th
International Statistical Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) codes B57 and all subcategories
(B57.0 to B57.5) marked on the underlying and/or associated causes of death field were
selected [11, 12].
One of the critical challenges for Chagas disease control is that many individuals with the
indeterminate form of Chagas disease are not aware that they are infected, so that these indi-
viduals are potential onward T. cruzi transmitters and may even die without being diagnosed
with the disease. Mortality-associated with Chagas disease is still inadequately estimated, par-
ticularly for those with the indeterminate form of the disease. Important unanswered questions
include: do persons with indeterminate disease have an increased risk of dying? Studies that
compare mortality among seropositive and seronegative individuals can help reduce this
knowledge gap as described in a systematic review and meta-analysis published in 2016 [13].
The objective of the study was to compare death rates during an up to 14 year follow-up period
among Chagas disease seropositive blood donors and seronegative blood donors identified in
the period 1996–2000 in the city of São Paulo, Brazil.
Methods
This is a retrospective cohort study. This study compared mortality rates and causes of death
in blood donors at Fundac
¸ão Pro
´-Sangue—Hemocentro de São Paulo (FPS), one of the largest
blood banks in State of São Paulo, located in São Paulo city.
Subjects
FPS is a reference center in Latin America, and the proportion of the supply collected is
approximately 33% of all donated blood used in the metropolitan region of São Paulo city.
FPS is a reference center for the Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO),World Health
Organization (WHO) and the Brazilian Ministry of Health, it collects and processes 90,000
blood units annually that are used by more than 100 health institutions [14].
Blood donors constitute a particular population in which, if infected, seropositive in-
dividuals are mostly asymptomatic and therefore are more likely to be in the indeterminate
form Chagas disease. Although donation eligibility assessment does not include EKG or X
rays, blood donors go through an interview before donating and requirements to donate
include being in good health with no evidence of or reported history of Chagas disease or
cardiomyopathies.

 During the study period (1996–2000) FPS screened all donors with 3 serological assays
(indirect immunofluorescence (IIF), indirect hemaglutination (IHA), and enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA)) [15]. Donors reactive on all 3 assays were considered con-
firmed positive. Using blood bank computerized records, all confirmed seropositive donors
for Chagas disease were included (n = 2,842) and a random sample of blood donors seronega-
tive for all screening tests performed at FPS during the same time period was selected, that is, 2
seronegative donors to each seropositive matched by year of donation (n = 5,684). During the
study period, FPS routinely performed the following serology screening tests on all donations
before releasing units for transfusion: syphilis, Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV),
Human T-cell lymphotropic viruses I and II (HTLV), Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), Hepatitis B
Virus (HBV), and Chagas disease.
Ascertainment of death status
In order to ascertain the death status of the study population, a record linkage (RL) was per-
formed to link records of the FPS database with the Brazil national mortality information sys-
tem (Sistema de Informac
¸ões sobre Mortalidade—SIM) records. As Brazil does not have a
unique national identity number, a probabilistic RL was performed using open source soft-
ware. Patients’ name, mother´s name and date of birth were the chosen linking variables. One
of the advantages of the use of this software in our context is that it links names and other vari-
ables through the use of a Soundex system which is specific for Portuguese phonetics (Reclink
III, version 3.0.4 4005, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) [16].
The RL procedure used here has been described in depth in a previous publication [17]. In
this previous study, we assessed the RL methodology validity by assembling a list of blood
donors with known vital status. Sensitivity and specificity of the RL method to detect mortality
were 94% (95%CI, 90–97%) and 100% (95%CI, 98%-100%), respectively.
In the SIM database, records containing the variables patients’ name, mother´s name, date
of birth and address of residence were only available for the years 2001 to 2009 (SIM version
extracted on 11/01/2010, Brasilia, Brazil). FPS donors included in the study donated blood
during the period of 1996 to 2000, this means that even though we were able to retrospectively
follow all donors for at least nine years, up to first five years of follow-up were not available in
SIM. For the cohort that donated blood in 1996, we missed the first five years, for the 1997
cohort, we missed the first four years and so forth. In other words, irrespective of their Chagas
serology status, we do not know whether those who donated blood in 1996, for example, died
in the period of 1996 to 2000. However, based on findings of seropositive and seronegative
individuals who donated blood in 2000 and for whom we only missed deaths that might have
happened during the year of their blood donation, we found that deaths were extremely rare in
the first year after donation. Because of this finding and with a view of circumscribing this data
limitation, we made the analytical assumption that nobody in our cohort died in the years
1996 to 2000.
Description of causes of death
For the descriptive analysis, the underlying causes of death of seropositive and seronegative
donors were grouped by chapters in the ICD-10.
For the multivariate analysis, causes of death were analyzed according to three groups: A)
Confirmed deaths due to Chagas disease, B) Confirmed and possible deaths due to Chagas dis-
ease, and C) Death due to all causes. Group A is hierarchically a subgroup of group B, which is
a subgroup of group C. “Confirmed deaths due to Chagas disease” refers to deaths recorded
with ICD-10 codes B57.0—B57.5 listed on the underlying or the associated causes of death

 fields. “Confirmed and possible deaths due to Chagas disease” refer to deaths recorded with
ICD-10 codes B57.0—B57.5 plus other codes indicating cardiac abnormalities that are possibly
due to Chagas disease listed on the underlying or the associated causes of death fields: I42.0—
Dilated cardiomyopathy, I42.2—Other hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, I47.0—Re-entry ven-
tricular arrhythmia, I47.2—Ventricular tachycardia, I49.0—Ventricular fibrillation and flutter,
I50.0—Congestive heart failure, I50.1—Left ventricular failure, I50.9—Heart failure, unspeci-
fied and I51.7—Cardiomegaly.
Statistical analysis
Comparisons of characteristics of donors that were seropositive and seronegative or that were
alive or dead at the end of the follow-up period were performed using two-tailed Fisher Exact
tests or Chi-squared tests, as appropriate. Mortality rates were calculated by dividing the num-
ber of donors that died (numerator) by the total person-years at risk of dying during the fol-
low-up period, i.e. from donation to death or to the end of the study period (denominator).
Survival of seropositive and seronegative donors over time was graphically assessed by Kaplan-
Meier (KM) curves and statistical differences tested with the Logrank test.
Age and sex were the only two demographic variables available for analysis in the FPS data-
base that represented potential confounders of the association between the outcomes variables
and the main explanatory variable under investigation, i.e. serological status. Age was analyzed
a categorical variable (18–29 years, 30–39 years, 40–49 years and >50 years).
Multiple Cox Regression models were used to derive hazard ratios (HR) for the outcomes
studied, adjusting for confounders and testing for interactions, where appropriate. Two sets of
analyses were performed one for the whole cohort and another excluding Chagas disease posi-
tive donors co-infected with one or more of the following infections: syphilis, HIV, HTLV,
HCV and HBV.
Regression models containing all potential predictors were estimated. The predictor vari-
ables available for the regression models were age group and sex. Stepwise backward selection
procedures were used to remove variables. Variables were removed with Wald test p-values
�0.2. The remaining variables were then successively removed based on lack of evidence of
confounding and their contribution to the models. Variables whose removal from the models
caused substantial changes (defined as >10%) in the HRs were retained, as were variables
whose removal incurred significantly reduced model fit based on likelihood ratio tests (p-val-
ues <0.05). For each outcome and potential risk factor, the proportional hazards assumption
was tested statistically using Schoenfeld residuals and by examining for parallel curves in log-
log plots. Schoenfeld residuals tests were not statistically significant and the curves were mostly
parallel, indicating no evidence of violation of the proportional hazards assumption. In addi-
tion, the proportional hazard was assessed by including a time-dependent interaction term in
the multivariable Cox models and by testing the statistical significance of this interaction using
the likelihood ratio test. Consistently, results indicated no evidence of violation of the assump-
tion. Statistical analyses were conducted using Stata version 13.1 (StataCorp LP, College Sta-
tion, TX, USA) software [18].
Ethical approval
Ethical approval for this study was obtained from the Ethics Research Committee of Clinical
Hospital of the School of Medicine—University of Sao Paulo, HC-FMUSP (CAAE:03882512.
4.0000.0065). HC-FMUSP Ethics Research Committee determined it unnecessary to obtain
informed consent from each individual for reviewing medical records, given the difficulty of

 obtaining such consent and because the study was conducted using 2 existing databases. The
identifiers were removed from database after the probabilistic RL was performed.
Results
Probabilistic record linkage results
Out of 1,354,569 blood donors to FPS during the study time period, 2,842 confirmed positive
cases and 5,684 controls (matched by year of donation) were assessed for death status and are
described on Table 1.
The RL method identified a total of 262 deaths, 159 (5.6%) among the seropositive blood
donors and 103 (1.8%) among the seronegative. Mortality was significantly higher in seroposi-
tive donors.
Out of the 2842 Chagas disease seropositive donors, 128 (4.5%) were also seropositive for at
least one of the other tested infections. Syphilis (51 donors) was the most common co-infec-
tion, followed by HBV (35 donors) and HCV (26 donors), HTLV (21 donors) and HIV (2
donors). A total of 12 donors were co-infected with Chagas disease plus two of the other
infections.
Causes of death
The distribution of the underlying causes of death of seropositive and seronegative donors, as
classified by ICD-10 chapters, is shown in Table 2. Distribution by subcategories of ICD-10 is
available in a supplemental table (S1 Table). Seropositive donors died more frequently of dis-
eases classified with codes of Chapter IX—Diseases of circulatory system and Chapter I—Cer-
tain infectious and parasitic diseases as compared to seronegative donors, On the other hand,
seronegative donors died more frequently of external causes (Chapter XX).

 Out of the 262 donors that died, 26 had codes B57 listed as the underlying cause of death
and were therefore classified as "Confirmed deaths due to Chagas disease". All of them were
seropositive for Chagas disease. There was no record with B57 listed as an associated cause of
death, but there was one seropositive donor with code B57 listed on part II (co-morbidities)
on the death certificate.
A total of 49 donors were classified as "Confirmed and possible deaths due to Chagas dis-
ease". This number includes all 26 donors classified as "Confirmed deaths due to Chagas dis-
ease" plus 23 donors that had codes indicating cardiac abnormalities possibly related to Chagas
disease, listed as an underlying or associated cause of death. Codes indicating cardiac abnor-
malities possibly related to Chagas disease were listed as associated causes of death in 16
(61.5%) of the 26 donors classified as "Confirmed deaths due to Chagas disease". Out of the
other 236 donors that were not classified as "Confirmed deaths due to Chagas disease", only 23
(9.8%) had any of these codes listed as an underlying or associated cause of death (p<0.001).
Moreover, these codes were listed in 35 (22%) of the 159 deaths of seropositive donors and in
only 4 (3.9%) of the 103 deaths of seronegative donors (p<0.001).
The underlying causes of death of the 49 donors classified as "Confirmed and possible
deaths due to Chagas disease" is shown in Table 3. It was unexpected to find code B56.9 (Afri-
can trypanosomiasis) in a donor seropositive for T. cruzi. While possible, it may also have been
a coding mistake.
Survival analysis
Donors’ cumulative survival according to serology, without excluding co-infected individuals,
is shown in Fig 1 and according to serology and age group in Fig 2. Survival curves of seroneg-
ative donors were better than those of seropositive ones (p<0.001). The same pattern was
observed for the KM curves by age group. For the age group 40–49 years the difference did not
reach statistical significance (p = 0.097).
Multivariate analysis
In the multivariate analysis, estimated crude and adjusted hazard ratios were calculated for
each of the three different case definitions: A) Confirmed deaths due to Chagas disease B)
Confirmed and possible deaths due to Chagas disease and C) Death due to all causes (Table 4).

 As there were no confirmed deaths due to Chagas disease in the seronegative group, HRs
could not be estimated for this case definition. The age adjusted HR for mortality in seroposi-
tive donors was 2.3 (95%CI 1.8–3.0) times higher than seronegative ones when deaths due to
all causes were considered and the age and sex adjusted HR for mortality was 17.9 (95%CI 6.3–
50.8) times higher for confirmed and possible deaths due to Chagas disease.
Excluding co-infected donors did not appreciably change the results. When multivariate
analyses were performed excluding the 128 co-infected donors, seropositive donors had a HR
2.2 (95%CI = 1.7–2.9, p-value<0.001) times higher than seronegative ones for all cause deaths
and a HR 16.1 (95%CI = 5.6–45.9, p-value<0.001) times higher when considering confirmed
and possible deaths due to Chagas disease.
Discussion
In this study, we compared the mortality rates of blood donors identified as seropositive for
Chagas disease and seronegative for all screening tests based on donation testing in the 5-year
time period, 1996–2000. Our results show that seropositive blood donors had a risk of dying
over the study time period 2.3 times greater than seronegative individuals. When considering
only deaths due to Chagas disease or those that had underlying causes of cardiac abnormalities
that could indicate Chagas disease, seropositive blood donors had a much higher risk of death
than seronegative donors. In a recent systematic review, Cucunuba et al. analyzed 25 papers
published on mortality of Chagas disease from 10,638 individuals and 53,346 persons-year of
follow-up. Only six of those studies focused on asymptomatic patients [19–24], following a

 total of 4,393 individuals for 34,217 person-years of observation. Crude relative risk of mortal-
ity from these studies varied from 0.81 to 3.59.
In this study, we have been able to follow 8,526 individuals for 100,467 person-years of
observation, doubling the data available and contributing to a more precise evaluation of the
impact of Chagas disease-associated mortality among asymptomatic seropositive individuals.
Classifying mortality for persons who are initially identified as being in the indeterminate
form is difficult because disease progression is slow, studies need large sample sizes and very
long follow-up periods. Population studies are expensive, and in areas with low prevalence
such as the city of São Paulo, with prevalence rates of less than 1% [5, 6], screening of a large
number of individuals would be necessary to achieve a sufficient number of seropositive cases.
We overcame this problem by focusing on blood donors that are routinely screened for Chagas
disease and that data are available through computerized systems. In Brazil, the national mor-
tality information system has a national coverage and the quality of its cause of death data has
improved substantially over the last two decades [25–28].
A provocative finding is that cardiac causes of death with no mention of Chagas disease was
significantly more common among seropositive donors. Indeed, of the 45 deaths due to car-
diac disease among seropositive donors only 26 (58%) had Chagas disease listed on their death
certificate as an underlying cause of death. This indicates that the impact of Chagas disease
mortality in Brazil is underestimated when analyses of only death records that specifically
mention Chagas disease as the underlying cause of death are conducted [11]. The fact that
Chagas disease was not reported as an underlying or associated cause of death on the death

 certificate of 42% of seropositive donors that died due to cardiac causes demonstrates under
ascertainment of Chagas disease pathogenesis, highlighting its status as a neglected disease.
Given the context for donation test result notification in Brazil and because the seropositive
donors were asymptomatic at time of donation, only those that returned to the blood bank to
get their screening tests results would have been notified of being seropositive for T. cruzi
infection.
The use of the probabilistic RL method implies we might have missed some deaths [17].
However, as reported previously by our group, the methodology used had a sensitivity of 94%
and a specificity of 100%, making us confident that the deaths found do represent true
matches. But the main limitation of our study was that death information recorded by name
was not available in the mortality database for the years 1996 to 2000, so that we were unable
to ascertain whether or not donors in our cohort died in the early years of follow-up. In the
analysis, we could have removed donors from this period and analyzed only those donating
from 2001 onwards, but we faced the problem that during the study years, donors seropositive
for Chagas disease were progressively less frequent in our database [5]. This decrease is

 probably due to two reasons: 1) vector transmission control activities in the country causing a
decreased overall number of seropositive individuals in the population [5], and 2) in order to
increase blood donations, from 1995–2001 FPS conducted a campaign to recruit previous
donors seronegative for all screening tests to donate again, so that the proportion of donors
who had not donated before became increasingly smaller compared to repeated donors [29]. If
we had used in our cohort blood donors only from 2001 onward, the number of seropositive
cases would be substantially lower and the follow-up period would be shorter, with the poten-
tial to attenuate the results of the analyses of this slow progressing disease.
However, early deaths after donation were not frequent, as observed for those who donated
in 1999 and 2000 for whom we were able to ascertain whether or not they had died after their
first or second year of follow-up, respectively (see S2 Table). If we had had mortality data for
the whole cohort period, we have no reason to suppose that there would be an excess of early
deaths in seronegative donors that would counterbalance the excess of late deaths that we
found in the seropositive ones. Moreover, because the proportion of ICD-10 chapter XX,
external causes of death, were equivalent in the seropositive and seronegative groups, an addi-
tional level of assurance is provided that there was no clear differential bias in mortality ascer-
tainment between these two groups. Even if the number of deaths has been underestimated by
the RL method and available data in SIM, the impact would be expected to be non-differential
indicating the findings of our study are robust. In summary, we do not believe that this limita-
tion greatly affected our results.
Another limitation with greater potential impact on our results is the fact that data regard-
ing socioeconomic status was not available in the blood bank database, so we could not control
for this effect in our multivariate models. In general, persons with T. cruzi infection are mostly
poor, less educated, and from rural areas. This combination of factors could lead to increase
mortality for reasons such as less healthy lifestyles or access to care. In turn, this could lead to
increased mortality. Yet, these individuals presented to blood donate and at the time were eli-
gible and donated following the extensive health history assessment covering a range of topics,
including current physical health, substance abuse history, and sexual history. Our analysis

 might have generated increased accuracy in the HR results if we had been able to adjust for
socioecomic status.
Although our study is focused in the city of Sao Paulo, we believe it well represent Brazil.
Internal migration was an important factor for population increase in the city of Sao Paulo
[30]. Data regarding State of Birth is not available at FPS data system, nevertheless, in a previ-
ous study done by our group in the same center (Retrovirus Epidemiological Donor Study
(REDS–II)), seropositive and seronegative donors were interviewed and individuals born in
the State of Sao Paulo represented 13% of the seropositive and 55% of the seronegative blood
donors [9].
We believe that most Chagas disease seropositive donors were in the indeterminate form of
the disease. Individuals who present to donate blood have to report if they do not have any cur-
rent serious conditions in a comprehensive questionnaire about their health status. Questions
such as “Do you have a severe heart problem?” and “Do you have arrhythmia and use medica-
tion for this problem?” are part of the screening questionnaire. However, we do not know if
any of the donors had abnormal EKGs or abnormalities identifiable by X-ray, in which case
they would be classified in the clinical form of the chronic phase of the disease. The increased
mortality findings have high relevance for common assumptions about Chagas disease mor-
bidity. It is not uncommon to find articles in the literature that consider the indeterminate
form of the disease as a benign disease not requiring close medical attention [20, 31, 32]. How-
ever, such studies are generally based on following a small number of people and often without
appropriate comparison groups [13]. When clinicians read these articles they may feel justified
in not treating their patients with the limited number of therapeutic options that are available.
Because available pharmacotherapy is not very effective and all of them have potential impor-
tant side effects [32, 33], clinicians may not want to treat indeterminate Chagas. Our findings
suggest that this belief may be erroneous and that the indeterminate form, even in a relatively
young population, is associated with higher mortality rates. Earlier treatment to reduce mor-
bidity and mortality may be important. Chagas is a neglected disease and research is urgently
needed in order to test new therapeutic options with fewer side effects and to find better corre-
lates of disease progression.
In conclusion, this analysis shows that there is an excess risk of death in donors who test
seropositive for Chagas disease compared to seronegative donors. Chagas disease is an under-
estimated cause of death in the Brazilian National Mortality Information System.
