While a fraction of cancer patients treated with anti–PD-1 show durable therapeutic responses, most remain un-
responsive, highlighting the need to better understand and improve these therapies. Using an in vivo screening
approach with a customized shRNA pooled library, we identified DDR2 as a leading target for the enhancement of
response to anti–PD-1 immunotherapy. Using isogenic in vivo murine models across five different tumor histologies—
bladder,breast,colon,sarcoma,andmelanoma—weshowthatDDR2depletionincreasessensitivitytoanti–PD-1treat-
mentcomparedtomonotherapy.Combinationtreatmentoftumor-bearingmicewithanti–PD-1anddasatinib,atyrosine
kinase inhibitor of DDR2, led to tumor load reduction. RNA-seq and CyTOF analysis revealed higher CD8+ T cell popula-
tions in tumors with DDR2 depletion and those treated with dasatinib when either was combined with anti–PD-1 treat-
ment. Our work provides strong scientific rationale for targeting DDR2 in combination with PD-1 inhibitors.
INTRODUCTION
Targeting antibodies to programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) is an
effective treatment across multiple cancer types (1, 2). While a subset of
patients receiving these therapies experience favorable responses, many
still show disease progression (1–4), highlighting the importance of oth-
er mechanisms influencing immune responsiveness in these tumors.
Combining therapies that enhance antitumor immunity has there-
fore been an area of great interest to the entire cancer community. This
is reflected by the number of clinical trials investigating inhibition of
PD-1 in combination with a second treatment to enhance response
to this relatively new class of anticancer drugs, which has soared from
a single new trial in 2009 to over 1100 trials in 2017 (5). While this
growth indicates the excitement surrounding immune-focused treat-
ment modalities, it has also markedly outpaced the gathering of pre-
clinical evidence supporting them (4). Furthermore, testing all the
possible drug combinations with checkpoint inhibitors may exceed
the number of eligible cancer patients who can be enrolled in clinical
trials, and this may require lower powered designs (5). Together, these
issues highlight the need for an approach to determine rationale ther-
apeutic combinations to apply to patient population.
Here, we describe a critical advance in the rapidly evolving field of
cancer immunotherapy using in vivo functional genomics to identify
genes whose inhibition potentiates the response to anti–PD-1 immuno-
therapy. Specifically, we define a novel mechanism whereby targeting
the collagen receptor DDR2 (discoidin domain receptor 2) elicits a sig-
nificantly enhanced response to immune checkpoint blockade with
PD-1 inhibitors. We show this combination to be robust across
multiple tumor models representing diverse cancer types and present
the preclinical data that served as the rational basis for an ongoing
clinical trial.
RESULTS
Identification of top candidate genes for enhanced response
to anti–PD-1
To assess tumor responses to anti–PD-1 therapy in an immuno-
competent animal, we established a syngeneic cell line model of murine
bladder cancer derived from chemically induced tumors that are known
to have molecular characteristics similar to those found in human blad-
der cancer (6, 7). Tumors were excised from N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl)
nitrosamine (BBN)–treated C57BL/6 mice and adapted to in vitro
cell culture to generate the NA13 cell line (Fig. 1A). Whole-exome
sequencing (WES) of NA13 revealed missense mutations in Trp53,
Aird1a,andEP300, whichare commonly foundinBBN-inducedmouse
bladder tumors and in human bladder cancer datasets (6, 7). The full set
of mutations identified through WES is reported in table S1.
Using NA13, we performed an in vivo short hairpin RNA(shRNA)–
based screen of select druggable targets for which there are U.S. Food
and Drug Administration (FDA)–approved drugs and identified genes
whose knockdown in tumors was able to potentiate response to anti–
PD-1 immunotherapy. First, we injected NA13 cells containing a
pooled 34-gene shRNA library (five shRNAs per gene) subcutaneously
into syngeneic immunocompetent mice. To identify candidate genes
whose depletion led to enhanced cell death mediated by the immune-
activating anti–PD-1, we quantified shRNA constructs in tumor
samples following therapy using next-generation sequencing and then
prioritized genes that were preferentially lost in the anti–PD-1–treated
group compared to the immunoglobulin G (IgG)–treated group (Fig.
1B). Following established approaches (8), we determined preferential
loss using three different methods: (i) percentage of total shRNAs per
gene with reduced counts (Fig. 1C), (ii) ranking genes by their first and
second most reduced shRNA based on average fold change (Fig. 1D),
and(iii) the numberof shRNA constructs per gene identified among the

 top 15% most depleted shRNAs in the library (Fig. 1E). Assessment
using all three methods identified DDR2, a collagen receptor that,
when activated, triggers a signaling cascade involving SHP-2, SRC,
and MAP (mitogen-activated protein) kinases (9, 10), as the top-
ranked gene.
Knockdown of DDR2 sensitizes tumor cells to
anti–PD-1 therapy
To validate the screening results, we knocked down DDR2 in the NA13
cell line and tracked tumor growth in the presence and absence of anti–
PD-1 treatment. Stable shRNA-mediated knockdown of DDR2 was
confirmed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR; fig.
S1A) and immunoblot (Fig. 2A). The combination of DDR2 depletion
and treatment with anti–PD-1 was highly effective in controlling NA13
tumors (Fig. 2B). Because DDR2 alterations (overexpression, ampli-
fication, and mutations) are known to drive more aggressive pheno-
types in several types of cancer (11–19), we tested the generalizability
of our NA13 results using breast, melanoma, and colon cancer cell lines.
Knockdown of DDR2 in B16F10, a melanoma cell line, was confirmed
(Fig. 2C and fig. S1B). Anti–PD-1 treatment of mice was effective at
reducing pulmonary metastases only in shDDR2 B16F10 cells (Fig. 2,
D to F). A marked reduction or elimination of visible tumors on the
lung surface was observed (Fig. 2, D and E). Upon histologic evaluation,
both shControl and shDDR2 tumors treated with IgG presented with
high tumor infiltration, areas of focal inflammation and necrosis, and
loss of bronchial epithelium (fig. S2). No visual differences were ob-
served with respect to tumor size, suggesting that the tumor numbers
are what account for the observed increased tumor burden in the lungs.
In contrast, the mice bearing shDDR2 tumors treated with anti–PD-
1 exhibited minimal tumor burden (fig. S2). Single-gene validation with

a strong T cell signature with multiple T cell receptor signaling pathways
significantly enriched in the former group (Fig. 3A). Cytometry by time-
of-flight (CyTOF) analysis of these tumors revealed increased CD8+
T cell infiltration into shDDR2 tumors treated with anti–PD-1 (Fig. 3B),
which was not seen in the spleen (fig. S3). No changes were observed in
PD-1 expression levels on the tumor-infiltrating Tcells across treatment
groups (fig. S4). These observations through both analysis at the cellular
and gene expression levels suggest a strong T cell presence following
treatment of shDDR2- or dasatinib-treated tumors with anti–PD-1.

 Dasatinib and anti–PD-1 combination therapy enhances
tumor control
DDR2 is a target of multiple FDA-approved kinase inhibitors (22).
Dasatinib, the most potent of these inhibitors, has been studied in
multiple clinical trials, including lung cancer patients with activating
DDR2 mutations (16). To further evaluate the efficacy of targeting
DDR2, we tested the combination of dasatinib and anti–PD-1. Whereas
therapeutic blockade of PD-1 or DDR2 alone had little or no effect on
NA13 tumors, treatment with the combination of dasatinib and anti–
PD-1 showed a significant reduction in tumor burden (Fig. 4A). Similar
results were seen with MC38 colon cancer model (Fig. 4, B and C) and
1956 sarcoma model (Fig. 4D).
Immune profiling of tumors shows enhanced presence of
CD8+ T cells
CyTOF analysis of MC38 tumors in mice receiving dasatinib and
anti–PD-1 showed a significant increase in both splenic and tumor-
infiltrating CD8+ T cells (Fig. 4, E and F, and fig. S5). Because these
findings with dasatinib and anti–PD-1 combination reflect a similar
pattern as seen in the shDDR2 and anti–PD-1 combination, this sug-
gests a direct role of tumor DDR2 expression in mediating this immune
response (Fig. 3B). While dasatinib and anti–PD-1 treatment increased
CD8+ T cells in both the tumor and spleen, treatment of shDDR2 tu-
mors with anti–PD-1 led to increased CD8+ T cells only in the tumor. In
both cases, the observed increase in CD8+ T cells is unique to the com-
bination therapy and is suggestive of a specific immune response to tu-
mor antigens because of both treatments. The presence of CD8+ T cells
in the tumor microenvironment and the expansion of preexisting, tu-
mor antigen–specific T cell clones are also critical and predictive of a
favorable response with anti–PD-1 therapy (23).
To identify associations between DDR2 expression and inferred
immune infiltration in human tumors, we estimated the relative abun-
dance of immune populations using the CIBERSORT (24) method and
bulk tumor RNA-seq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA;
fig. S6). Low DDR2 expression is associated with increased CD8+
T cells and activated dendritic cell infiltration (Fig. 4G), which has
been shown to be predictive of better patient outcome (25–31). These
findings support our own experimental findings with shDDR2- and
dasatinib-treated tumors, with PD-1 blockade exhibiting an increased
presence of CD8+ T cells (Fig. 4F). Human tumors with low DDR2
expression also exhibit reduced levels of macrophages (Fig. 4G), whose
presence has been shown to negatively affect the efficacy of anti–PD-1
(32). These findings suggest that patients with tumors low in DDR2
expression have a tumor microenvironment more likely to favorably
respond to anti–PD-1 treatment.
DISCUSSION
While immune checkpoint–based therapies have been shown to be
successful across multiple tumor types, many patients still progress
on these therapies. Combining approved checkpoint inhibitor antibo-
dies with each other and with other approved cancer therapeutics is a
natural attempt to improve efficacy of the former but, as discussed
above, has major practical and scientific limitations. Our study focused
on identifying drug target genes, using a functional genomics–based ap-
proach that could be targeted in conjunction with anti–PD-1 to increase
immune response and tumor clearance. DDR2, our top candidate gene,
was validated by both shRNA-mediated knockdown and pharmaco-
logical inhibition with dasatinib. In both cases, targeting DDR2
alongside anti–PD-1 therapy proved to be very efficacious across
multiple different cancer types in preclinical in vivo models.
DDR2 is a receptor tyrosine kinase that is activated by fibrillar col-
lagen, thus playing a key role in the regulation of collagen-cell interac-
tions (33, 34). Alterations to DDR2, including overexpression,
amplification, and mutations, have been reported across broad cancer
types and, in many cases, are known to drive a more aggressive pheno-
type (11–19). While DDR2 is inhibited by several FDA-approved recep-
tor tyrosine kinase inhibitors, dasatinib was chosen for our study due to
its status as the most potent inhibitor of DDR2 both in vitro and in vivo
and the prevalence of its use in clinical trials for tumors with DDR2-
specific activating mutations (19, 22). We use dasatinib as an example
of an immediately applicable, widely available drug, which also happens
to target our gene of interest, DDR2. We recognize that a possible dis-
advantage with dasatinib could be the multitargeted nature of this drug
(e.g., SRC and ABL) (35, 36), and so, the effects seen with dasatinib can-
not be parsed out specifically to account for the effects due to DDR2 and
that of the other targets. While the inhibition of these additional kinases
is known to affect critical immune cell subsets (e.g., BTK and FMS)
(37, 38), inhibition of DDR2 likely plays a prominent role in the ef-
ficacy of dasatinib due to the observations from our DDR2 genetic
knockdown experiments and the work of other groups (15, 16, 19).
DDR2 is involved in the remodeling of the extracellular matrix dur-
ing morphogenesis and tissue repair, as well as differentiation and
proliferation (39, 40). DDR2 is a critical regulator of the mesenchy-
mal stem cell phenotype, type I collagen–related functions, and mi-
gration (12). DDR2 expression in both tumor and stromal cells has
been shown to play a critical role in cancer progression and metas-
tasis formation. DDR2 in the basal epithelium of tumor cells controls
the formation of invasion of tumor organoids, while in the stroma
(cancer-associated fibroblasts), it is critical for extracellular matrix pro-
duction and the organization of collagen fibers through cancer-associated
fibroblasts (41). Future work will look at parsing dasatinib’s combinatorial
effect with checkpoint inhibitors on DDR2 versus that of it’s other known
targets especially since dasatinib has been shown to reduce T regulatory
cell numbers (42).
Our screen approach builds a more immediately translational
framework compared to genome-wide screens that have aimed to bet-
ter understand the mechanisms of resistance to immunotherapy.
Manguso et al. (43) completed a pooled in vivo genetic screen that
identified known and previously unknown immune evasion mole-
cules. Their loss-of-function screen identified PTPN2 as a potential
gene that could be targeted to enhance immunotherapy (43). Patel et al.
(8) identified genes, with a focus on APLNR, which are a prerequisite
for an effective response to immunotherapy using a genomic screen
with a T cell–focused approach. Loss of APLNR reduced the efficacy
of T cell–based immunotherapies (8). Our work further expands
upon the use of functional genomics–based screens to find gene tar-
gets that can improve current immunotherapies. While these other
screens used CRISPR-Cas9 technology for complete knockout of a
gene, we chose an shRNA-based approach, which, in most cases,
has incomplete knockdown of a gene and mimics drug-mediated in-
hibition more faithfully.
Our results reveal important insights into the effects of targeting
DDR2, a collagen receptor, in combination with PD-1 inhibition.
The preclinical efficacy of the DDR2 and PD-1–targeted combina-
tion provided compelling evidence for the initiation of, and support
for, the FRACTION-Lung trial (NCT02750514), which evaluates
nivolumab in combination with dasatinib. Last, our results provide

 a strong rationale for further investigation into the molecular me-
chanisms by which DDR2 and increased collagen signaling from
the tumor microenvironment support immune evasion. It will be
of interest to determine whether targeting collagen signaling, which
is a common feature of many tumor types, represents a viable
strategy to enhance the activity of immune checkpoint inhibitors.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Mouse cancer cell lines
NA13 cell line was isolated and cultured from BBN carcinogen–
induced bladder tumor of C57BL/6 female mice. C57BL/6 mice (7 to
8 weeks old) were treated with 0.05% BBN in water for 12 weeks. After
12 weeks of BBN treatment, mice were kept for an additional 12 weeks
on the regular water. Mice were then sacrificed, and a part of the blad-
der tumor was washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and minced
into small pieces with RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 20%
fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1 mM sodium pyruvate, and 1% antibiotic/
antimycotic solution. The culture dish was then kept in a CO2 incubator
with 5% CO2 and 95% humidity to allow the tumor cells to attach and
grow. After 2 days in culture, the excess floating tumor tissue was re-
moved, and cells were further maintained in culture for 6 to 8 weeks
before freezing in liquid N2. B16F10 was obtained from the American
Type Culture Collection through the University of Colorado Tissue
Culture Core. B16F10 was a gift from T. Lyons (University of Colorado).
MC38 and 1956 were provided by Bristol-Myers Squibb. All cell lines
were authenticated and tested to be mycoplasma-free. E0771 was main-
tained in RPMI 1640 medium with 5% FBS. B16F10 was maintained in
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with 10% FBS. MC38 was main-
tained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 25 mM Hepes and
10% fetal calf serum. All cells were grown at 37°C in a humidified atmo-
sphere (5% CO2).
WES of NA13
GenomicDNA (gDNA)wasextractedfromtheNA13celllineusing the
Puregene Cell and Tissue Kit (Qiagen). Exome capture was performed
using the SureSelect XT Mouse All Exon Kit (Agilent Technologies).
Novogene (https://en.novogene.com/) performed WES using the Illu-
mina NovaSeq 6000 platform. Paired-end 150–base pair (bp) reads
were sequenced at a depth of 100×. Reads from the raw FASTQ file were
aligned to the mouse reference genome (MM9) using BWA (v0.7.8-
R455) (44). The BAM file generated from BWA was sorted using
SAMtools (v1.0) (45), and Picard (v1.111) was used to mark duplicates
and recalibrate base quality scores. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) and small indels were called according to the GATK command
line tools (v3.8.0) (46), including HaplotypeCaller, SelectVariants, and
VariantFiltration programs using default parameters. We lifted over the
mouse MM9 coordinates to genome version MM10 using the Univer-
sity of California, Santa Cruz Genome Browser LiftOver Tool (https://
genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgLiftOver). To characterize the alterations
on gene location and impact on the associated protein, we annotated
the NA13 SNPs and small indels using SnpEff (47).
Library design and analysis
A target gene list began with a listing of all cancer clinical trials avail-
able in clinicaltrials.gov. Using this portal, the word cancer was entered
in the “Condition/Disease” field. We then parsed this file to count most
common drugs and biologicals, selected those with readily available in-
hibitors, and then determined which of these are relatively specific for
their targets and have mouse homologs. The custom pooled mouse
shRNA library was prepared by the University of Colorado Functional
Genomics Shared Resource using MISSION shRNA lentiviral trans-
duction particles (Sigma-Aldrich). Each gene was targeted by an aver-
age of five distinct shRNA The RNA Consortium (TRC) constructs for
a total of 169 shRNAs. NA13 cells were transfected with lentivirus and
underwent puromycin selection (1.5 mg/ml) 48 hours later. Cells
underwent selection for 4 days before expansion in RPMI 1640 medium
supplemented with 10% FBS and 1 mM sodium pyruvate. Cells were
expanded for at least 2 days before subcutaneous hind flank injection
into 8-week-old C57BL/6 female mice. Once tumors reached 50 to
100 mm3, mice were injected with 50 mg of mouse anti–PD-1 antibody
(IgG1-D265A) or isotype control (IgG1; clone 4F7, Bristol-Myers
Squibb) every 3 days for a total of three doses. Mice were euthanized
once tumors reached 500 mm3. Tumor was harvested, snap-frozen in
liquid N, and stored at −80°C until DNA isolation. gDNA was isolated
from each tumor using the Gentra Puregene Kit (Valencia, CA, USA).
Custom dual-indexed primers (48, 49) were used to amplify the shRNA
constructs. One microgram of total gDNA was used in each normal goat
serum library PCR with Herculase II Fusion Enzyme (Agilent Technolo-
gies, Cedar Creek, TX, USA) for 26 cycles. The 290-bp amplicon of in-
terest from each reaction was purified using SPRIselect beads (Beckman
Coulter, Brea, CA, USA). Each sample was quantified using the Qubit
dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Invitrogen, Eugene, OR, USA) and KAPA
Library Quant Kit for Illumina-based sequencers (Cape Town, South
Africa) before equimolar pooling for sequencing. Sequencing was per-
formed on an Illumina HiSeq4000 (San Diego, CA, USA) at 1 × 151 bp
through the University of Colorado Microarray and Sequencing Core.
Deconvolution of samples was dependent on the unique dual indices
based on Illumina P5 and P7 sequences.
shRNA counts were normalized using the following equation
CN ¼ ATST
where CN is the normalized count, AT is the averaged total count
across samples, and ST is the total shRNA count of the normalized
sample. Treatment and control samples were normalized separately
using separate (treatment- and control-specific) total count averages.
Outliers were identified using Grubbs test. The shRNAs were counted
by comparing the shRNA library against the obtained sequences and
searching for exact sequence match. This method assumed that se-
quencing errors are equally distributed among nucleotides and
shRNAs. The percentage of reduced shRNAs was calculated by com-
paring the mean read count of the checkpoint blockade–treated sam-
ple to the IgG control–treated sample for the same shRNA. A
reduction was considered to be true if the read counts were 80% or
less of that of the IgG control group. The percentage of reduced
shRNAs was then determined on the basis of the number of shRNAs
that were reduced compared to the total shRNAs per a given gene.
qPCR and immunoblotting (Western blot analysis)
NA13, B16F10, and E0771 cell lines were homogenized using
QIAshredder (Qiagen), followed by RNA extraction using the
RNeasy Plus Mini Kit with gDNA Eliminator (Qiagen). Com-
plementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized using iScript Reverse
Transcription Supermix (Bio-Rad). qPCR for DDR2 was per-
formed using 5′-TGGCATGAGCAGAAACCTGT-3′ (forward)
and 5′-ACTTGCCGTGGTGAATTTGC-3′ (reverse) primers, with
iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) run on a QuantStudio 6 Flex

 Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). To determine the
changes in mRNA expression as measured by quantitative reverse
transcription PCR, the DDCt method was used. Expression was nor-
malized to internal control b-actin, and the level of gene knockdown
was determined by comparing with control cells.
Whole-cell extracts were prepared from NA13, B16F10, and E0771
cell lines using radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer [50 mM tris
(pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, and protease
inhibitors (Roche)]. Following total protein quantification, lysates were
separated by SDS–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred
to polyvinylidene difluoride (Bio-Rad) membrane using a transfer ap-
paratus according to the manufacturer’s instruction (Bio-Rad). After
incubation with 5% nonfat milk in TBST [25 mM tris, 150 mM NaCl.
0.1% Tween 20 (pH 7.5)] for 1 hour, the membrane was probed with
antibodies against DDR2 (AF2538; 1:1000; R&D Systems) or anti–b-
actin AC-74 (1:20,000; Sigma Chemical Co.) monoclonal antibodies
overnight. Membranes were washed three times for 10 min with TBST
and incubated with a 1:5000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase–
conjugated anti-goat (SC-2020, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-
mouse (Bio-Rad) antibodies for 2 hours. Blots were washed three times
with TBST and incubated in SuperSignal West Pico PLUS Chemi-
luminescent Substrate for 5 min at room temperature (Thermo Fisher
Scientific). The blots were imaged using ChemiDoc imaging system
according to the manufacturer’s instruction (Bio-Rad).
In vivo studies
All experiments were approved by the University of Colorado Denver
Animal Care and Use Committee and carried out according to ap-
proved protocols. Female C57BL/6 mice (Charles River) were received
at 6 weeks old and allowed to acclimate for at least 1 week in sterile
microisolator cages with constant temperature and humidity. Mice
had free access to food and water.
For NA13, mice were injected with 1 × 106 cells in 100 ml of sterile
PBS subcutaneously in the right hind flank. For the E0771 mammary
tumor model, mice were injected with 5 × 104 cells in the third left
thoracic mammary fat pad. For the 1956 sarcoma and MC38 colon
carcinoma model, 6- to 8-week-old mice were injected subcutaneously
on the hind flank with 1 × 106 cells. All tumor cells were harvested in
log-phase growth on the day of injection.
Mice were monitored twice weekly for tumor development. Mea-
surements commenced from when the tumor was first palpable. Tu-
mor size was determined using an electronic caliper to measure the
length and width and calculated by (L × W2)/2, where L is the largest
diameter measurement of the tumor and W is the shorter perpendic-
ular tumor measurement. Animals were randomized into treatment
groups, ensuring similar average tumor volumes among the groups,
weighed, and identified via ear punch. For treatment randomization,
MC38 tumors were allowed to grow to 75 to 200 mm3 (tumors outside
the range were excluded), and animals were evenly distributed to var-
ious treatment and control groups.
Dasatinib was synthesized by Bristol-Myers Squibb Laboratories
(Princeton, NJ), as previously described (50). Dasatinib was formu-
lated in 80 mM citrate buffer and administered orally to mice by
body weight at a dose of 30 mg/kg (1956, initiated on day 11 after
tumor injection; MC38, initiated on day 5 after tumor injection for
10 doses) or 60 mg/kg (NA13, initiated on day 16 after tumor injection
for three doses). Mouse anti–PD-1 antibody (IgG1-D265A) and
isotype control (IgG1; clone 4F7) were produced by Bristol-Myers
Squibb Laboratories (Redwood City, CA) and were formulated in
PBS and administered intraperitoneally at a dose of 50 mg per mouse
(NA13, initiated on day 16 for three doses; E0771, initiated on day 7 for
three doses), 100 mg per mouse (B16F10, initiated on day 8 for three
doses), or 200 mg per mouse (1956, initiated on day 11; MC38, initiated
on day 5 for two doses). The health of the mice was closely monitored,
and mice were immediately euthanized if any signs of distress were ob-
served or tumor volume exceeded 15 mm in diameter.
For the B16F10-induced pulmonary metastases model, mice were
intravenously challenged with 2 × 105 B16F10 cells in 100 ml of sterile
PBS. Treatment with anti–PD-1 commenced on day 8, and mice were
euthanized on day 22. Lungs were harvested, formalin-fixed, paraffin-
embedded with 5-mm sections, cut, and hematoxylin and eosin–stained
by the University of Colorado Histology Core. Lungs were analyzed by
an American College of Veterinary Pathologists board-certified veter-
inary pathologist.
Single-cell mass cytometry by time of flight
NA13 tumors were collected after final measurement day. Tumors were
weighed, mechanically dissociated, and enzymatically digested using
Liberase DL (Roche) in Hanks’ balanced salt solution for 30 min at
37°C. The solution was passed through a 70-mm cell strainer (Fisher-
brand) to obtain a single-cell suspension. Cells were counted using a
TC-20 counter (Bio-Rad) with trypan blue exclusion.
Metal-conjugated antibodies were purchased from Fluidigm and
used at manufacturer-recommended concentrations (table S4). Live tu-
mor and spleen cells were washed with Maxpar PBS (Fluidigm) and
counted on the Vi-CELL Cell Viability Analyzer (Beckman Coulter),
normalizing to a final count of 2 × 106 to 3 × 106 cells per sample in
RPMI 1640 medium (Corning Cellgro). Live versus dead staining was
achieved by resuspending cellsin a solution of 25 mM cisplatin (Fluidigm)
in RPMI 1640 medium and incubating for 1 min at room tem-
perature. Samples were quenched with Maxpar Cell Staining Buffer
(Fluidigm),spun down at 500g for 5 min, and then fixed by resuspend-
ing 1.6% paraformaldehyde (PFA) inPBS for 10 min at room tempera-
ture. The cells were washed once with Maxpar Cell Staining Buffer to
remove fixative from the solution and once with Maxpar Barcode Perm
Buffer to begin cell permeabilization for barcoding, centrifuging at 800g
at 22°C per spin. Barcoding was performed as per the manufacturer’s
recommendations with palladium metal barcoding reagents (Fluidigm),
where samples were eventually pooled together, with spleen samples
pooled separately from tumor samples. Treatment with anti-mouse
FcgII/FCgIII-blocking antibody 2.4G2 (prepared in-house) for 10 min
was followed by surface staining at the manufacturer’s recommended
antibody staining concentrations (Fluidigm). The cells were stained
for 30 min at room temperature, then washed with Maxpar Cell Stain-
ing Buffer, and permeabilized in 4× FoxP3 Fix/Perm Buffer overnight at
4°C. The cells were washed once with 1× FoxP3 Fix/Perm Buffer, and
intracellular staining was performed for 2 hours at 4°C following the
manufacturer’s protocol (Fluidigm) and then washed twice with 1×
FoxP3 Perm Buffer. The cells were incubated in 1.6% PFA in PBS with
100 nM iridium nucleic acid intercalator (Fluidigm) overnight and
washed twice in double-distilled H2O before analysis on a Helios mass
cytometer (CyTOF, Fluidigm) at an event rate of 400 to 500 events
per second.
MC38 tumors were collected in RPMI 1640 medium and then
enzymatically dissociated using Mouse Tumor Dissociation Kit and
gentleMACS Dissociator (Miltenyi Biotec) according to the manu-
facturer’s protocol. The cells were stained with a panel of metal isotope–
conjugated anti-mouse antibodies (DVS Sciences; table S5).

 Data were analyzed with PhenoGraph. The 1.0.153 version of R stu-
dio was downloaded from the official R website (www.r-project.org/).
Release 3.6 of the cytofkit package was downloaded from Bioconductor
(https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/manuals/cytofkit/
man/cytofkit.pdf) and opened in R. Manually gated singlet (19Ir +
193Ir +), viable (195Pt +) events were imported into cytofkit, subjected
to PhenoGraph analysis, and clustered on the basis of 30 markers (in-
sert antibody table), with the following settings: merge method: “min”
(100,380 events total, 25,095 events from each file), transformation:
cytofAsinh, cluster method: Rphenograph, visualization method: tSNE
(t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding), and cellular progres-
sion: NULL. PhenoGraph identified 23 unique clusters. These results
were visualized via the R package “Shiny,” where labels, dot size, and
cluster color were customized. Clusters were colored according to phe-
notype based on the median expression of various markers. The fre-
quency of each cluster was determined via csv files generated by the
algorithm. All graphs were made using GraphPad Prism 7. P values
were calculated using the two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with
multiple comparisons, with statistical analyses subjected to multiple
testing correction.
Tumor expression analysis (RNA-seq)
Tumors were mechanically disassociated with a homogenizer (Omni
International) and then passed through a QIAshredder (Qiagen),
gDNA eliminator columns (Qiagen), and RNeasy Plus Mini Kit, as
per the manufacturer’s instructions, for RNA extraction. Library prep-
aration and sequencing were performed by Novogene. Quality and
quantity of RNA were analyzed using NanoDrop, agarose gel electro-
phoresis, and Agilent 2100. mRNA was purified from total RNA using
poly-T oligo-attached magnetic beads. mRNA was first fragmented
randomly by fragmentation buffer, followed by NEB library prepara-
tion (New England Biolabs). First-strand cDNA was synthesized using
random hexamer primer and M-MuLV Reverse Transcriptase (RNase
H−), with second-strand cDNA synthesized using DNA polymerase I
and RNase H. Double-stranded cDNA was purified using AMPure XP
beads (Beckman Coulter). Exonuclease was used to eliminate over-
hangs on the double-stranded cDNA. 3′ ends were adenylated, and
NEBNext adaptors were ligated in preparation for hybridization.
Library fragments were purified with AMPure XP system (Beckman
Coulter). Sequencing was performed by Novogene on an Illumina plat-
form paired-end 150 bp with 20 million reads per sample.
Transcript quantification was performed using RSEM (v1.2.31)
(51) with default parameters and Bowtie 2 (v2.1.0) as the read aligner
(52). Reads were mapped directly to mouse transcripts and summa-
rized at the gene level using annotations from Ensembl r91, genome
build GRCm38.p5. Quantification of genes as expected counts was
compiled. Differential expression was performed using voom function
in the limma R package (53). Genes with an averageexpected count less
than five were removed, normalization factors were calculated, and
comparisons between groups were made using the voom function
using default parameters.
The curated gene set canonical pathways (C2.CP) was downloaded
from the MSigDB collection of genes sets (v6.1) (21). Human genes
were mapped and then replaced with mouse genes using the vertebrate
homology mapping from the Mouse Genome Informatics resources
(www.informatics.jax.org/downloads/reports/HOM_AllOrganism.
rpt). The updated C2.CP gene set with mouse genes and the log2-
transformed fold change ranked list of genes from the RNA-seq exper-
iment comparing controland shDDR2 NA13 tumors grown in syngeneic
mice treated with anti–PD-1 were used as input to GSEA (20, 21).
GSEA was run in preranked mode with default parameters.
To identify immune-related gene sets that were significantly up-
regulated, we further filtered the full set of GSEA results, based on the
Jaccard distance (number of genes in the intersection divided by the
number of genes in the union of any two gene sets). This quantifies
the overlap in genes between two gene sets. We selected gene sets that
shared ≥0.25, were significantly up-regulated (false discovery rate <
0.01), and were immune related. From the comparison of control and
shDDR2 NA13 tumors grown in syngeneic mice treated with anti–PD-
1, we found 39 gene sets that met these criteria. These are the gene sets
shown in Fig. 3. Results from CIBERSORT (24) using TCGA bladder
cancer gene expression (54) were downloaded from The Cancer Im-
mune Atlas (TCIA) and processed according to TCIA protocols (55).
