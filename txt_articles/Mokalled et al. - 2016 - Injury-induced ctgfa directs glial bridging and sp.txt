bridging and spinal cord
regeneration in zebrafish

Unlike mammals, zebrafish efficiently regenerate functional nervous system tissue
after major spinal cord injury. Whereas glial scarring presents a roadblock for
mammalian spinal cord repair, glial cells in zebrafish form a bridge across severed
spinal cord tissue and facilitate regeneration. We performed a genome-wide profiling
screen for secreted factors that are up-regulated during zebrafish spinal cord
regeneration. We found that connective tissue growth factor a (ctgfa) is induced in
and around glial cells that participate in initial bridging events. Mutations in ctgfa
disrupted spinal cord repair, and transgenic ctgfa overexpression or local delivery of
human CTGF recombinant protein accelerated bridging and functional regeneration.
Our study reveals that CTGF is necessary and sufficient to stimulate glial bridging
and natural spinal cord regeneration.
T
he spinal cord of adult zebrafish recovers
spontaneously after injury (Fig. 1A and fig.
S1, A and B). Efficient axon growth, adult
neurogenesis, and absence of glial scarring
distinguish this injury response from that
in mammals (1, 2). After initial inflammation,
ependymal cells proliferate and glia form a bridge
that is thought to provide a scaffold for axonal
growth (3). The severed cord reconnects, and new
neuronal connections lead to functional recovery
(Fig. 1A) (4). Here, we analyzed extracellular fac-
tors up-regulated in the regenerating zebrafish
spinal cord.
To identify potential secreted, pro-regenerative
signaling molecules, we screened zebrafish tran-
scriptomes for genes induced after spinal cord
injury (Fig. 1B and table S1). Our screen iden-
tified seven genes encoding secreted extra-
cellular proteins, including fibronectin 1 a (fn1a),
previously implicated in axon growth promotion
(5, 6). Transcripts for fn1a, fn1b, connective tis-
sue growth factor a (ctgfa), myostatin b (mstnb),
and stanniocalcin 1 like (stc1l) increased in ep-
endymal cells at 1 and 2 weeks post-injury (wpi)
(Fig. 1C and fig. S1C). Whereas fn1a was ex-
pressed around the entirety of the central canal
at 2 wpi, mstnb and ctgfa were predominantly
expressed in the dorsal and ventral ependyma,
respectively (Fig. 1C).
CTGF is a matricellular, multifunctional pro-
tein that can influence the activity of multiple
major signaling pathways, affecting cell adhe-
sion, migration, proliferation, and differentiation.
CTGF expression increases after central nervous
system (CNS) trauma in rodents, but its function
after spinal cord injury has not been elucidated
(7–9). Because ctgfa is induced upon spinal cord
injury in zebrafish, we hypothesized that it may
have pro-regenerative roles. We analyzed ctgfa
expression along the rostrocaudal spinal cord
axis (Fig. 1D). At 1 wpi, ctgfa transcription was
induced in multiple cell types across the lesion
site and in ependymal cells at the central canal
near the lesion. At this time point, we detected
strongest ctgfa expression in the ventral epen-
dyma. By 2 wpi, ctgfa expression localized to
ventral ependymal cells and marked the cellular
bridge that had formed at the lesion site. Ex-
pression declined beyond 3 wpi (fig. S2A). Thus,
ctgfa expression correlates with formation of
the glial bridge.
To identify the cell populations that express
ctgfa during spinal cord repair, we generated
transgenic reporter zebrafish with a 5.5-kb ge-
nomic sequence upstream of the ctgfa translation-
al start site fused to an enhanced green fluorescent
protein (EGFP) reporter cassette. ctgfa:EGFP flu-
orescence resembled endogenous ctgfa mRNA
expression in spinal cord tissue at 2 wpi (fig. S2,
B and C). As early as 5 days post-injury (dpi),
domains of ctgfa:EGFP and glial fibrillary acidic
protein (GFAP), a marker of multiple glial cells
in the CNS, overlapped within a subpopulation
of glial cells at the injury site (Fig. 1E). We inter-
pret these to be bridging cells. Similarly, ctgfa:
EGFP colocalized with the GFAP+ bridge at 2 wpi
(Fig. 1E). Comparison of ctgfa:EGFP and GFAP
expression on serial cross sections revealed that
~97% of GFAP+ bridging glia at the lesion core
were also EGFP+ at 1 wpi (fig. S3). Further away
from the lesion, ctgfa:EGFP was mainly present
in ventral ependymal cells (fig. S3). We also de-
tected ctgfa:EGFP in skeletal muscle, bone cells,
and reactive fibroblast-like cells around the le-
sion site. ctgfa-driven expression suggested de-
lineation of “pioneer” bridging glia.
To determine whether ctgfa is required for
spinal cord regeneration, we generated a ctgfa
mutant allele (ctgfabns50; referred to as ctgfa−)
that harbors a frameshift-causing 7-nucleotide
deletion within the third exon of the ctgfa locus
(fig. S4, A to C). ctgfa−/− animals are adult viable
and appear to have unaffected motor function
capacity (10) (fig. S4D). However, ctgfa−/− ani-
mals showed diminished swim capacity after
spinal cord injury, with no significant functional
recovery between 2 and 6 wpi (Fig. 2A). Heter-
ozygous (ctgfa+/−) animals showed partial recov-
ery of swim capacity by 6 wpi (Fig. 2A). At 4 wpi,
anterograde axon tracing indicated that axon
regeneration across the lesion site was reduced by
~25% in ctgfa+/− and ~60% in ctgfa−/− spinal cords
proximal to the lesion, and by ~40% in ctgfa+/−
and ~80% in ctgfa−/− cords distally (Fig. 2B). Thus,
ctgfa is required for spinal cord regeneration.
Deficits in glial bridging might underlie the
defects in spinal cord regeneration displayed
by ctgfa mutants. Using GFAP and acetylated
a-tubulin immunohistochemistry, we observed
robust glial bridges in wild-type and ctgfa+/− ani-
mals at 4 wpi (Fig. 2C and fig. S5A). However,
ctgfa−/− animals displayed ~71% less bridging than
did wild-type clutchmates (Fig. 2C and fig. S5A).
At 2 wpi, glial cells within ctgfa−/− injury sites
often failed to extend projections into the lesion
(fig. S5B). 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU) incor-
poration assays showed that ctgfa−/− zebrafish
displayed a ~48% reduction in glial cell prolif-
eration at 1 and 2 wpi (Fig. 2D and fig. S6).
EdU+GFAP− cell numbers were comparable in
wild-type, ctgfa+/−, and ctgfa−/− tissues at 1 wpi
(Fig. 2D), which suggests that the effects of
ctgfa mutations were preferential to glial cells.
Thus, ctgfa is required for the changes in pro-
liferation and morphology of glial cells during
spinal cord regeneration.
To examine the effects of excess ctgfa on spi-
nal cord regeneration, we generated and injured
transgenic fish that express full-length ctgfa un-
der control of a heat-inducible promoter (hsp70:
ctgfa-FL) (fig. S7). Recovery of swim capacity was
improved in ctgfa-overexpressing animals given
daily heat shocks and assessed at 2, 4, and 6 wpi
(Fig. 3A). Swim capacity was comparable between
sham-injured hsp70:ctgfa-FL and wild-type clutch-
mates at 2 and 6 weeks after heat shock (Fig. 3A),
indicating contextual effects of ctgfa overexpres-
sion. Histology indicated increased bridging and
axon regeneration in ctgfa-overexpressing fish
relative to controls at 2 and 4 wpi, respectively
(Fig. 3, B and C, and fig. S8A). Thus, whole-animal
ctgfa overexpression promotes regeneration after
spinal cord injury.
CTGF harbors four protein interaction domains
and a protease domain that self-cleaves CTGF
into profibrotic N-terminal and proliferative
C-terminal peptides (11, 12). To determine the
active portion of zebrafish Ctgfa during spinal
cord regeneration, we created transgenic fish with
heat-inducible expression of either N-terminal
or C-terminal ctgfa fragments (hsp70:ctgfa-NT
and hsp70:ctgfa-CT) (fig. S7A). Only ctgfa-CT over-
expression recapitulated the pro-regenerative

capacity was markedly increased in ctgfa-CT–
overexpressing animals relative to ctgfa-NT–
overexpressing or wild-type clutchmates (Fig. 3D).
Anatomically, ctgfa-CT overexpression resulted
in a factor of >3 increase in glial bridging at
2 wpi and a factor of >2 increase in axon growth
at 4 wpi (Fig. 3, E and F, and fig. S8B). These
experiments indicate that the pro-regenerative
activity of Ctgfa maps to its C-terminal domains.
To examine whether the effects of Ctgfa aug-
mentation could be reproduced by localized de-
livery into the spinal cord lesion site, we injured
wild-type animals and applied human recombi-
nant CTGF (HR-CTGF-FL and HR-CTGF-CT) pep-
tides adjacent to the lesion site at 5 and 10 dpi

generation at 2 and 4 wpi, corresponding to 9
and 23 days after initial treatment. Human CTGF

with either HR-CTGF-FL or HR-CTGF-CT enhanced

HR-CTGF-FL–treated or HR-CTGF-CT–treated

from Pseudomonas for controlling
corn rootworms

The coleopteran insect western corn rootworm (WCR) (Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte)
is a devastating crop pest in North America and Europe. Although crop plants that produce
Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) proteins can limit insect infestation, some insect populations have
evolved resistance to Bt proteins. Here we describe an insecticidal protein, designated
IPD072Aa, that is isolated from Pseudomonas chlororaphis. Transgenic corn plants expressing
IPD072Aa show protection from WCR insect injury under field conditions. IPD072Aa leaves
several lepidopteran and hemipteran insect species unaffected but is effective in killing WCR
larvae that are resistant to Bt proteins produced by currently available transgenic corn.
IPD072Aa can be used to protect corn crops against WCRs.
T
he coleopteran insect western corn rootworm
(WCR)(DiabroticavirgiferavirgiferaLeConte)
and related species cause extensive damage
to corn (Zea mays L.) in North America and
Europe, resulting in crop yield losses and
management costs (1–3). Farmer adoption of corn
plants that produce insecticidal proteins for con-
trolling major corn pests, including WCRs, has
increased productivity in areas with insect pres-
sure (4). Commercial transgenic crops introduced
to date for insect control have been developed
with genes from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) (5, 6).
These genes encode insect-specific crystal proteins
(Cry) or vegetative insecticidal proteins (Vip).
Four of them—mCry3A, Cry3Bb1, eCry3.1Ab, and
the binary protein complex Cry34Ab1/Cry35Ab1—
have been commercialized for WCR control in
the United States (5, 7). Emergence of WCR resist-
ance to mCry3A, Cry3Bb1, and eCry3.1Ab pro-
teins (8–10) under field conditions demonstrates
the need for broader, more durable strategies to
control insect infestations and limit the develop-
ment of resistance. The genetic diversity of Bt has
already been explored in a search for additional
insecticidal proteins (5). An alternative approach
involves disabling WCR genes by RNA interfer-
ence through the expression of double-stranded
RNA (11). We hypothesized that, like Bt, other
soil bacteria that live with soil-dwelling coleop-
teran larvae may produce proteins that kill corn
rootworms. Here we describe a potent and sel-
ective insecticidal protein from a Gram-negative
bacterium, Pseudomonas chlororaphis, which
we identified through screening soil-isolated
microbial strains. This protein protects trans-
genic corn plants from WCR injury under field
conditions.
We collected soil samples from the U.S. states
of Iowa, Illinois, and Wisconsin, and isolated
microbial strains under growth conditions to
favor species other than Bt. Crude protein extracts
from these isolates were screened for activity
against WCRs in artificial diet bioassays. One
isolate—identified as P. chlororaphis by 16S ribo-
somal DNA sequence analysis (12)—showed a po-
tent inhibitory effect on WCRs. We used multistep
chromatography to isolate the insecticidal protein
and achieved high-purity (>80%) enrichment in
the final step (fig. S1). The major protein band
with an apparent molecular weight of ~10 kDa
was digested with trypsin and subjected to iden-
tification by liquid chromatography–tandem mass
spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). We used the LC-MS/
MS data of tryptic peptides to search against a
protein database including protein sequences
translated from the in-house genome sequence
of this specific P. chlororaphis isolate. A high-
confidence match to a hypothetical protein en-
coded by a gene from our specific P. chlororaphis
isolate was obtained. This gene encodes a small
protein of 86 amino acids, which we designated
IPD072Aa (GenBank accession number KT795291).
IPD072Aa was clonedand expressed in Escherichia
coli to confirm that it was responsible for the
insecticidal activity. Affinity-purified recombinant
IPD072Aa was highly potent against WCR larvae
and also active against northern corn rootworm
(NCR) (Diabrotica barberi) larvae in diet bioassays
(Fig. 1).
To evaluate the activity spectrum, we tested
purified recombinant IPD072Aa protein at con-
centrations up to 875 mg/ml in diet assays against
several lepidopteran and hemipteran species—
includingblack cutworm (Agrotis ipsilon Hufnagel),
corn earworm (Helicoverpa zea Boddie), Euro-
pean corn borer (Ostrinia nubilalis Hübner), fall
armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda J. E. Smith),
soybean looper (Pseudoplusia includens Walker),
and western tarnished plant bug (Lygus hesperus
Knight)—and observed no mortality or inhibitory
effect on any of those insect species. We also used
an Agrobacterium-mediated transient gene expres-
sionsystem (13) toexpress IPD072Aa undercontrol
of a double-enhanced mirabilis mosaic virus
viral promoter (14) in common bean (Phaseolus
vulgaris). Sets of leaf disks transiently expressing
