BACKGROUND
Sunitinib, a vascular endothelial growth factor pathway inhibitor, is an effective 
treatment for metastatic renal-cell carcinoma. We sought to determine the effi-
cacy and safety of sunitinib in patients with locoregional renal-cell carcinoma at 
high risk for tumor recurrence after nephrectomy.
METHODS
In this randomized, double-blind, phase 3 trial, we assigned 615 patients with 
locoregional, high-risk clear-cell renal-cell carcinoma to receive either sunitinib 
(50 mg per day) or placebo on a 4-weeks-on, 2-weeks-off schedule for 1 year or 
until disease recurrence, unacceptable toxicity, or consent withdrawal. The primary 
end point was disease-free survival, according to blinded independent central re-
view. Secondary end points included investigator-assessed disease-free survival, 
overall survival, and safety.
RESULTS
The median duration of disease-free survival was 6.8 years (95% confidence inter-
val [CI], 5.8 to not reached) in the sunitinib group and 5.6 years (95% CI, 3.8 to 6.6) 
in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.59 to 0.98; P 
= 
0.03). Overall 
survival data were not mature at the time of data cutoff. Dose reductions because 
of adverse events were more frequent in the sunitinib group than in the placebo 
group (34.3% vs. 2%), as were dose interruptions (46.4% vs. 13.2%) and discon-
tinuations (28.1% vs. 5.6%). Grade 3 or 4 adverse events were more frequent in the 
sunitinib group (48.4% for grade 3 events and 12.1% for grade 4 events) than in 
the placebo group (15.8% and 3.6%, respectively). There was a similar incidence 
of serious adverse events in the two groups (21.9% for sunitinib vs. 17.1% for 
placebo); no deaths were attributed to toxic effects.
CONCLUSIONS
Among patients with locoregional clear-cell renal-cell carcinoma at high risk for 
tumor recurrence after nephrectomy, the median duration of disease-free survival 
was significantly longer in the sunitinib group than in the placebo group, at a cost 
of a higher rate of toxic events. (Funded by Pfizer; S-TRAC ClinicalTrials.gov num-
ber, NCT00375674.)

E
ach year, approximately 300,000 per-
sons worldwide are diagnosed with renal-
cell carcinoma, resulting in 129,000 deaths.1,2 
The prognosis for patients with renal-cell carci-
noma is dependent on the stage of disease and 
other risk factors. The 5-year survival rate is 53% 
for locoregional (stage III) disease and 8% for 
metastatic disease.3 Overall, locoregional disease 
is diagnosed in 16% of patients with renal-cell 
carcinoma,4 and up to 40% of these patients have 
a relapse with metastasis after nephrectomy.5,6 
The relapse risk can be assessed with the use of 
two validated models, the University of California 
Los Angeles Integrated Staging System (UISS)7,8 
and the stage, size, grade, and necrosis (SSIGN) 
score.9 (Additional details about disease staging 
are provided in the Supplementary Appendix, 
available with the full text of this article at 
NEJM.org.)
Although the prognosis for patients with 
metastatic renal-cell carcinoma has improved in 
the past decade, no curative treatment is cur-
rently available. Several adjuvant strategies, in-
cluding cytokine therapy, radiotherapy, and hor-
mone therapy, have been explored to decrease 
the rate of relapse, but none were successful.6 
The proven efficacy of antiangiogenic therapies, 
including the vascular endothelial growth factor 
(VEGF) pathway inhibitors sunitinib10 and 
sorafenib,11 in patients with metastatic renal-cell 
carcinoma12 supports the evaluation of these 
drugs as adjuvant therapy.6 In a previous phase 3 
trial (ASSURE) involving patients with locally 
advanced renal-cell carcinoma, investigators did 
not find any treatment advantage for adjuvant 
therapy with sunitinib or sorafenib over placebo.13 
In Sunitinib as Adjuvant Treatment for Patients 
at High Risk of Recurrence of Renal Cell Carci-
noma Following Nephrectomy (S-TRAC), we ex-
amined the efficacy and safety of sunitinib versus 
placebo in preventing relapse in patients with re-
sected locoregional renal-cell carcinoma at high 
risk for disease recurrence.
Methods
Patients
From September 19, 2007, to April 7, 2011, we 
enrolled 615 patients at 99 centers in 21 countries 
in this prospective, randomized, double-blind, 
phase 3 trial. Eligible patients were at least 18 years 
of age and had received a diagnosis of locore-
gional renal-cell carcinoma (tumor stage 3 or 
higher, regional lymph-node metastasis, or both) 
on the basis of modified UISS criteria.8 Other 
eligibility criteria included histologic confirma-
tion of clear-cell renal-cell carcinoma, no previ-
ous systemic treatment, a score of no more than 
2 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 
(ECOG) scale (which ranges from 0 to 5, with 
higher scores indicating greater disability) be-
fore nephrectomy, and treatment initiation with-
in 3 to 12 weeks after nephrectomy. The absence 
of macroscopic residual or metastatic disease af-
ter nephrectomy, as confirmed on blinded inde-
pendent central review of computed tomograph-
ic (CT) images, was required before enrollment. 
Exclusion criteria included renal metastasis or 
histologically undifferentiated tumors, diagno-
sis of a second cancer within 5 years before 
randomization, a major cardiovascular event or 
disease within 6 months before enrollment, 
and un 
controlled hypertension (blood pressure, 
>150/100 mm Hg).
Study Design and Oversight
Randomization was stratified according to the 
UISS-defined high-risk group, the ECOG score 
(<2 vs. 2), and country of residence (Table S1 in 
the Supplementary Appendix). Patients were as-
signed in a 1:1 ratio to receive either oral suni-
tinib (50 mg per day) or placebo on a 4-weeks-on, 
2-weeks-off schedule for 1 year. Dose interrup-
tions or dose reductions to 37.5 mg per day were 
allowed, depending on the type and severity of 
toxicity. Treatment continued until disease re-
currence, diagnosis of a secondary cancer, unac-
ceptable toxic effects, or consent withdrawal.
A separate cohort of patients who were en-
rolled in China was added after the initiation of 
the trial to satisfy the regulatory filing in China. 
Data from the China cohort, which were not ma-
ture at the time of the data cutoff, were intended 
to be analyzed separately and are therefore not 
included in this report. (Additional details are 
provided in the Supplementary Appendix.)
The trial was approved by the independent 
review board or ethics committee at each center 
and was conducted in accordance with Interna-
tional Conference on Harmonisation Good 
Clinical Practice guidelines and applicable local 
regulatory requirements and laws. All the pa-
tients provided written informed consent. An 
independent data and safety monitoring com-

mittee regularly reviewed patient safety and ef-
ficacy data.
The trial was designed as a collaboration be-
tween the sponsor, Pfizer, and the academic au-
thors. Manuscript development was led by the first 
author. All the authors contributed to drafting of 
the manuscript and provided final approval to 
submit the manuscript for publication. Sponsor-
funded medical writing support was provided by 
Engage Scientific Solutions of Envision Pharma 
Group. The trial protocol and statistical analysis 
plan are available at NEJM.org. The authors as-
sume responsibility for the accuracy and com-
pleteness of the data and vouch for the fidelity 
of the trial to the protocol.
Assessments and End Points
Tumor assessments included CT (≤5-mm slice 
thickness) or magnetic resonance imaging of the 
chest, abdomen, pelvis, and other applicable sites, 
conducted at screening, every 12 weeks during the 
first 3 years, and every 6 months thereafter until 
disease recurrence or occurrence of metastasis, 
whichever was determined first until the time of 
final analysis. Diagnosis of recurrence was based 
on centrally confirmed imaging or histologic 
findings.
The primary end point was the duration of 
disease-free survival, which was defined as the 
interval between randomization and the first tu-
mor recurrence, the occurrence of metastasis or a 
secondary cancer (as assessed by blinded inde-
pendent central review), or death. Secondary end 
points included overall survival, safety, and health-
related quality of life. Additional analyses are 
described in the Methods section in the Supple-
mentary Appendix.
The duration of exposure was defined as the 
period between the first and last dose of sunitinib 
or placebo, including interruptions in administra-
tion, cycle delays, and changes in the scheduled 
2-week off-treatment period. Safety assessments 
included adverse events (classified and graded 
according to the National Cancer Institute Com-
mon Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, ver-
sion 3.0), laboratory tests, physical examinations, 
ECOG scores, vital signs, and 12-lead electrocar-
diographic assessments. Safety data were col-
lected up to 28 days after the end of treatment.
We evaluated health-related quality of life us-
ing the self-administered European Organization 
for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of 
Life Questionnaire–Core 30 (QLQ-C30) and the 
European Quality of Life–5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) 
questionnaire, which were completed on day 1 of 
each treatment cycle and at the end of treatment. 
A difference of 10 points or more on the QLQ-C30 
(which ranges from 0 to 100) between treatments 
was considered to be clinically meaningful.14,15 
(Higher scores on the QLQ-C30 functional scale 
and global health status indicate better function-
ing, whereas higher scores on the symptom scale 
or higher single-item scores indicate a worsening 
of symptoms.) Such changes with clinical impli-
cations were 0.06 to 0.09 points on the EQ-5D 
(which ranges from −0.11 to 1.00, with higher 
scores indicating better health status) and 7 to 12 
points on the EQ–Visual Analogue Scale (EQ-VAS, 
the second part of the EQ questionnaire, which 
ranges from 0 to 100, with higher scores indi-
cating a better health-related quality of life).16
We collected whole-blood and tumor speci-
mens to analyze genetic polymorphisms associ-
ated with renal-cell carcinoma and the expression 
of tissue biomarkers and to test their association 
with treatment outcomes. The results of biomarker 
analyses are not included in this report.
Statistical Analysis
We determined that 320 events of recurrence, di-
agnosis of a second cancer, or death would pro-
vide a power of 90% to detect a hazard ratio of 
0.69 for the comparison between sunitinib and 
placebo at a two-sided significance level of 0.05. 
Since there was a lower-than-expected rate of 
disease-free survival during the trial, the proto-
col was amended to specify that the final analy-
sis would occur approximately 5 years after the 
last patient underwent randomization. It was es-
timated that approximately 258 events would have 
occurred at that time, which would provide a 
power of 84% to detect statistical significance 
for a hazard ratio of 0.69. (Additional details are 
provided in the Methods section in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix.)
The intention-to-treat population included all 
the patients who underwent randomization and 
was the primary population for evaluating all 
efficacy end points and patient characteristics. 
We compared the time-to-event end points using 
a two-sided log-rank test stratified according to 
UISS high-risk group (Table S1 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix). We used Kaplan–Meier methods 
to determine the median durations of disease-

free survival and overall survival with 95% con-
fidence intervals.
Safety data were summarized descriptively for 
all patients who received at least 1 dose of sunitinib 
or placebo. QLQ-C30 subscales and single-item 
subscores were summarized according to the 
mean and median for each group and plotted ac-
cording to time. Scores on the EQ-5D and EQ–VAS 
were reported as means and standard deviations. 
We used a repeated-measures analysis with a 
mixed-effects model with treatment, time, treat-
ment according to time, and baseline as covari-
ates to estimate the mean difference in health-
related quality of life in the two groups. All 
statistical analyses were performed with the use 
of SAS software, version 9.2 (SAS Institute).
Results
Patients
Of the 615 patients who underwent randomiza-
tion, 309 were assigned to receive sunitinib and 
306 to receive placebo. Of these patients, 306 re-
ceived sunitinib and 304 received placebo; 5 pa-
tients did not receive a study drug either because 
of withdrawal of consent (3 in the sunitinib 
group) or because of evidence of metastasis (2 in 
the placebo group) (Fig. 1). The characteristics of 
the patients were well balanced in the two groups 
at baseline (Table 1). The median duration of 
follow-up was 5.4 years (95% confidence interval 
[CI], 5.2 to 5.6) in the sunitinib group and 5.4 
years (95% CI, 5.3 to 5.6) in the placebo group.
As of the data cutoff on April 7, 2016, all the 
patients had either completed or otherwise dis-
continued treatment. Data with respect to drug 
discontinuations and doses are provided in Table 
S2 in the Supplementary Appendix. The rates of 
treatment completion were 55.6% for sunitinib 
and 69.4% for placebo. The median treatment 
durations were similar, with 12.4 months (range, 
0.1 to 14.9) for sunitinib and 12.4 months (range, 
0.03 to 13.7) for placebo. Among the patients in 
the sunitinib group, 54.2% maintained the start-
ing dose (50 mg per day); the median daily dose 
was 45.9 mg (range, 8.9 to 52.6) in the sunitinib 
group and 50 mg (6.7 to 52.8) in the placebo 
group.
Efficacy
Disease-free Survival
On the basis of blinded independent central re-
view, the median duration of disease-free survival 
was 6.8 years (95% CI, 5.8 to not reached) in the 
sunitinib group and 5.6 years (95% CI, 3.8 to 6.6) 
in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.76; 95% CI, 
0.59 to 0.98; P 
= 
0.03) (Table 2 and Fig. 2). At the 
time of data cutoff, an event of disease recur-
rence, a second cancer, or death had occurred in 
113 of 309 patients (36.6%) in the sunitinib group 
and in 144 of 306 patients (47.1%) in the placebo 
group. At 3 years, the proportions of patients 
who were disease-free were 64.9% in the suni-
tinib group and 59.5% in the placebo group; at 
5 years, the proportions were 59.3% and 51.3%, 
respectively.
On the basis of investigator review, an event 
of disease recurrence, a second cancer, or death 
had occurred in 132 patients (42.7%) in the suni-
tinib group and 158 (51.6%) in the placebo group 
over the trial period. The median duration of 
investigator-assessed disease-free survival was 
6.5 years (95% CI, 4.7 to 7.0) in the sunitinib 
group and 4.5 years (95% CI, 3.8 to 5.9) in the 
Figure 1. Enrollment and Outcomes.
Among the patients who discontinued either sunitinib or placebo, other 
listed reasons for discontinuation included a deterioration in health status, 
loss to follow-up, protocol violation, a reason other than an adverse event, 
and an unknown reason.

ference in disease-free survival was significant on 
the basis of independent central review (hazard 
ratio, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.55 to 0.99; P 
= 
0.04) but not 
on the basis of investigator review (hazard ratio, 
0.76; 95% CI, 0.58 to 1.01; P 
= 
0.06) (Table 2).
There was a high concordance in the assess-
ments of disease-free survival according to blind-
ed independent central review and investigator 
review, with a low event disagreement in the two 
groups (11.3% for sunitinib vs. 8.5% for place-
bo). However, investigators called relapse earlier 
than the blinded independent central review 
more often for sunitinib than for placebo, as is 
represented by the early and late discordance 
rates (Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Overall Survival
Data for overall survival, a secondary end point, 
were not mature at the time of the data cutoff, 
with deaths reported in 64 patients (20.7%) in 
the sunitinib group and 64 (20.9%) in the pla-
cebo group. The median overall survival was not 
reached in either group, and the hazard ratio for 
the comparison between sunitinib and placebo 
was 1.01 (95% CI, 0.72 to 1.44; P 
= 
0.94) (Fig. S1 
in the Supplementary Appendix).
Safety
Treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 
99.7% of the patients in the sunitinib group and 
in 88.5% of those in the placebo group, whereas 
adverse events that investigators attributed to treat-
ment occurred in 98.4% and 75.7%, respectively. 
The most common all-cause adverse events in the 
sunitinib group were diarrhea, palmar–plantar 
erythrodysesthesia, hypertension, fatigue, and 
nausea (Table 3, and Table S4 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix); the most common adverse events 
that investigators attributed to treatment were 
diarrhea, palmar–plantar erythrodysesthesia, fa-
tigue, hypertension, and mucosal inflammation 
(Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix). Ad-
verse events of grade 3 or higher were reported 
in 194 patients (63.4%) in the sunitinib group 
and in 66 (21.7%) in the placebo group; grade 5 
events occurred in 5 patients (1.6%) in each group. 
The rates of serious adverse events were similar 
(21.9% and 17.1%, respectively) (Table S6 in the 
Supplementary Appendix).
Dose reductions or interruptions because of 
adverse events occurred in 34.3% and 46.4%, re-
spectively, of the patients in the sunitinib group 
and in 2.0% and 13.2% in the placebo group. 
Treatment discontinuations owing to adverse 
events occurred in 86 patients (28.1%) in the 
sunitinib group and 17 (5.6%) in the placebo 
group (Table S7 in the Supplementary Appendix). 
Renal-cell carcinoma was the most common 
cause of death in the two groups and accounted 
for 47 of 62 deaths (75.8%) in the sunitinib 
group and for 47 of 64 (73.4%) in the placebo 
group. No deaths were attributed to toxic effects 
related to a study treatment.

Sunitinib in Renal-Cell Carcinoma after Nephrectomy
cycle and >78% at the end-of-treatment assess-
ment). On most QLQ-C30 subscales, patients in 
the sunitinib group had lower scores than those 
in the placebo group. However, the estimated 
mean differences, while significant, did not reach 
the prespecified minimally important difference 
of 10 points, with the exception of diarrhea (mean 
difference, 12.0 points; 95% CI, 9.6 to 14.4) and 
loss of appetite (mean difference, 10.0 points; 
95% CI, 7.9 to 12.2; P<0.001 for both compari-
sons). Similarly, patients in the sunitinib group 
had significantly lower scores on the EQ-5D and 
EQ-VAS than did those in the placebo group, 
although the differences did not reach the mini-
mally important difference (Table S7 in the Sup-
plementary Appendix).
Discussion
Up to 40% of patients with locoregional renal-cell 
carcinoma have a relapse with metastasis after 
nephrectomy.5,6 There are limited data to show 
that adjuvant therapy can reduce the risk of re-
lapse, and standard management is limited to 
surveillance. In this trial, we found that patients 
in the sunitinib group had a longer median du-
ration of disease-free survival than did those in 
the placebo group (6.8 years vs. 5.6 years), as 
determined by blinded independent central re-
view. The benefit crossed the prespecified bound-
ary for significance at the time of the final analy-
sis. Disease-free survival curves separated early 
and remained separated over the course of the 
trial. The period of follow-up in our trial (median, 
5.4 years) was similar to that in the ASSURE trial 
(median, 5.8 years).13 However, since the life 
expectancy after nephrectomy in this population 
of patients is nearly 40% at 10 years,17 further 
study is needed to confirm whether the effect of 
adjuvant sunitinib treatment is maintained in the 
long term. At 5 years, the proportion of patients 
who were disease-free was 8.0 percentage points 
higher with sunitinib than with placebo, which 
suggests that the effect of 1 year of adjuvant treat-
ment with sunitinib is maintained over time.
The safety profile of adjuvant sunitinib was 
consistent with the broad experience observed in 
patients undergoing treatment for metastatic re-
nal-cell carcinoma.16,18 The rate of discontinua-
tion because of adverse events among patients in 
the sunitinib group (28.1%) was higher than that 
reported in the pivotal trial (8%) comparing suni-
tinib with interferon alfa in patients with meta-
static renal-cell carcinoma.19 In our trial, skin 
toxicity (palmar–plantar erythrodysesthesia), hy-
pertension, and fatigue were among the most 
commonly reported adverse events of grade 3 or 
higher in the sunitinib group; likewise, these 
events are commonly reported in sunitinib trials 
involving patients with metastatic disease.13,19,20 
However, in our trial, skin toxicity of grade 3 or 
higher was more frequent among patients receiv-
ing adjuvant therapy than in those with metastatic 
disease (16% vs. 5%).13,19 Overall, these results are 
consistent with the observation that although the 
type and incidence of adverse events may not 
differ greatly between these two patient popula-
tions, the events may be less acceptable among 
patients who have undergone nephrectomy.6
Sunitinib-treated patients had significantly 
lower scores for health-related quality of life than 
did those in the placebo group while they were 
receiving active treatment. Differences of 10 to 20 
points on the QLQ-C30 subscales have been re-
ported to correspond to a moderate quality-of-life 
change,14,15 and generally, a 10-point change is 
widely accepted as clinically meaningful across 
various types of cancer. In our trial, only lower 
scores for diarrhea and loss of appetite — both 
of which are well-known side effects of VEGF-
Figure 2. Disease-free Survival.
The median duration of disease-free survival according to independent 
central review was 6.8 years (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.8 to not 
reached) in the sunitinib group and 5.6 years (95% CI, 3.8 to 6.6) in the 
placebo group. At the time of data cutoff, an event of disease recurrence,  
a second cancer, or death had occurred in 113 of 309 patients (36.6%) in 
the sunitinib group and in 144 of 306 patients (47.1%) in the placebo group.

In the ASSURE trial, there was no improve-
ment in disease-free survival in patients receiving 
sunitinib or sorafenib as compared with placebo, 
including in subgroups of patients with clear-cell 
histologic results or high-risk (tumor stage 3 or 4) 
disease.13 Distinct patient populations, dose reg-
imens, and trial methods are likely to be respon-
sible for the different outcomes in the two trials. 
For example, the ASSURE trial included many 
patients with early (stage 1) tumors (9%) and pa-
tients with non–clear-cell histologic results (21%), 
whereas our trial was designed to include only 
patients with late-stage (locoregional), clear-cell 
renal-cell carcinoma. In the ASSURE trial, the 
starting dose of sunitinib was changed midtrial, 
from 50 mg to 37.5 mg, with subgroup analysis 
showing a trend toward a shorter duration of 
disease-free survival for those who initiated 
treatment at 37.5 mg; furthermore, dose reduc-
tions to 25 mg were allowed. In contrast, suni-
tinib was administered at 50 mg in our trial, 
with dose reduction allowed to 37.5 mg per day 
but not 25 mg per day. In addition, in our trial, 
disease-free status before enrollment was con-
firmed by central review of radiographs, and the 
primary end point of disease-free survival was 
based on blinded central review. In the ASSURE 
trial, both assessments were performed by inves-
tigators only.
In conclusion, patients with locoregional re-
nal-cell carcinoma at high risk for tumor recur-
rence after nephrectomy who were receiving ad-
juvant treatment with sunitinib had a longer 
duration of disease-free survival than did those
