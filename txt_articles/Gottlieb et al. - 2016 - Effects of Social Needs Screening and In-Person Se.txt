IMPORTANCE Social determinants of health shape both children’
s immediate health and their
lifetime risk for disease. Increasingly, pediatric health care organizations are intervening to
address family social adversity. However, little evidence is available on the effectiveness of
related interventions.
OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effects of social needs screening and in-person resource
navigation services on social needs and child health.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Patients were randomized to intervention or active
control conditions by the day of the week. Primary outcomes observed at 4 months after
enrollment included caregivers’reports of social needs and child health status. Recruitment
occurred between October 13, 2013, and August 27, 2015, in pediatric primary and urgent care
clinics in 2 safety-net hospitals. Participants were English-speaking or Spanish-speaking
caregivers accompanying minor children to nonacute medical visits.
INTERVENTIONS After standardized screening, caregivers either received written information
on relevant community services (active control) or received in-person help to access services
with follow-up telephone calls for further assistance if needed (navigation intervention).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Change in reported social needs and in caregiver
assessment of child’
s overall health reported 4 months later.
RESULTS Among 1809 patients enrolled in the study, evenly split between the 2 sites, 31.6%
(n = 572) were enrolled in a primary care clinic and 68.4% (n = 1237) were enrolled in an
urgent care setting. The children were primarily Hispanic white individuals (50.9% [n = 921])
and non-Hispanic black individuals (26.2% [n = 473]) and had a mean (SD) age of 5.1 (4.8)
years; 50.5% (n = 913) were female. The reported number of social needs at baseline ranged
from 0 to 11 of 14 total possible items, with a mean (SD) of 2.7 (2.2). At 4 months after
enrollment, the number of social needs reported by the intervention arm decreased more
than that reported by the control arm, with a mean (SE) change of −0.39 (0.13) vs 0.22 (0.13)
(P < .001). In addition, caregivers in the intervention arm reported significantly greater
improvement in their child’
s health, with a mean (SE) change of −0.36 (0.05) vs −0.12 (0.05)
(P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE To our knowledge, this investigation is the first randomized
clinical trial to evaluate health outcomes of a pediatric social needs navigation program.
Compared with an active control at 4 months after enrollment, the intervention significantly
decreased families’reports of social needs and significantly improved children’
s overall health
status as reported by caregivers. These findings support the feasibility and potential effect of
addressing social needs in pediatric health care settings.

Growing recognition of adversity’
s contribution to bio-
logical processes, health, and development has spurred calls
for interventions addressing social factors as part of routine
child health care.3 In 2013, the American Academy of Pediat-
rics’Task Force on Childhood Poverty endorsed the promo-
tion of evidence-based strategies for low-income children, in-
cluding payment and health delivery system reforms to reduce
negative health effects of poverty.18 Similarly, the American
AcademyofPediatricsrecommendedthatpediatriciansshould
increase interventions addressing social risks.19,20
In line with these recommendations, a number of social
interventions have emerged in pediatric clinical settings.21-25
Research on these efforts has primarily focused on assessing
intervention processes or reductions in social needs. Such
studies21-24,26,27 have demonstrated that social screening and
referrals can increase connections with community re-
sources and decrease social needs. However, no studies have
examined whether social interventions influence children’
s
health, to our knowledge.
We address this gap by evaluating the effect on family so-
cial needs and parent-reported child global health status of an
in-personscreeningandcasemanagementinterventiontarget-
ing pediatric social needs vs an active control condition provid-
ing written resource information. We hypothesized that the in-
person intervention would reduce social needs and improve
child health more than the provision of written information.
Methods
Setting, Participants, and Eligibility Criteria
Study protocols and materials were approved by the Univer-
sity of California, San Francisco, Committee on Human Re-
search and the Children’
s Hospital and Research Center Oak-
landInstitutionalReviewBoard.Alladultcaregiverscompleted
written informed consents, and assents for participation were
obtained for children 7 years or older. Study recruitment and
follow-up took place on a predetermined timeline between Oc-
tober 13, 2013, and August 27, 2015, in 2 safety-net hospitals
(Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital and Trauma Cen-
ter and University of California, San Francisco, Benioff Chil-
dren’
s Hospital Oakland), where most patients are enrolled in
Medicaid or lack health insurance coverage. Study partici-
pantsweredrawnfromfamiliesseenforchildren’
smedicalser-
vices in primary care or urgent care departments located in
those hospital settings. Eligible participants were English-
speaking or Spanish-speaking caregivers 18 years or older who
werefamiliarwiththechild’
shouseholdenvironmentandwere
livinginthecountywhereenrollmenttookplace.Familiesseek-
ing health care for a child with severe illness were excluded.
Only 1 child and 1 caregiver were enrolled per household re-
gardless of the number of visits, number of children seeking
care, or number of adults accompanying those children.
Volunteers drawn from local universities were trained to
recruit patients, conduct social screening, and serve as pa-
tient navigators for caregivers in the navigation intervention
arm. They received 8 hours of training covering intervention
procedures, cultural accountability, and community, hospi-
tal, and government social service resources, as well as moti-
vational interviewing. They also received ongoing, on-site
training from supervisors (A.A., C.S., and other nonauthors),
including observed volunteer-patient interactions, with feed-
back for quality improvement.
Study Procedures
A computer program determined the study randomization
schedule within each clinic setting, with day as the unit of ran-
domization and each calendar month as the randomization
block.Navigatorswerenotmaskedtostudyarmbecauseofthis
randomization method. They approached families between 9
AMand8 PMandadministereda10-minutebaselinesurveywith
eligible, consenting participants. The survey included ques-
tions about household demographics and perceived social, le-
gal, and mental health needs, as well as current benefits pro-
gram enrollment and child global health. To avoid interference
with clinical activities, medical staff (D.L., E.L., and other non-
authors) could interrupt survey administration, as needed, for
clinical care; if interrupted, the caregiver could resume the sur-
vey immediately after the clinical encounter. Families identi-
fying mental health needs for adult household members who
experienced violence were referred to social work or other ap-
propriate behavioral health professionals.
Active Control Arm
Because of ethical concerns about identifying social needs and
then not addressing them, we decided to provide control care-
givers with written community resource information with-
out the benefit of an in-person navigator or follow-up. After
survey completion, participants in the active control arm who
endorsed any social needs were provided with preprinted in-
formation about relevant resources available in their commu-
nities. County-specific resource guides were developed by lo-
Key Points
Question Can addressing social issues during pediatric primary
and urgent health care visits decrease families’social needs and
improve children’
s health?
Findings In this randomized clinical trial, the provision of
in-person resource navigation services significantly decreased
families’reports of social needs and significantly improved
children’
s overall health status compared with an active control
condition.
Meaning These findings suggest that addressing social needs in
pediatric health care settings can affect both family circumstances
and child health.

Navigation Intervention Arm
After completing the baseline survey, intervention caregivers
were offered a meeting with the navigator immediately after
the child’
s clinic visit or by telephone if the caregiver needed
to leave. Navigators used algorithms to provide targeted in-
formation related to community, hospital, or government re-
sources addressing needs that participants had prioritized. Re-
sources ranged from providing information about child care
providers, transportation services, utility bill assistance, or le-
gal services to making shelter arrangements or medical or tax
preparation appointments to helping caregivers complete ben-
efits forms or other program applications. Information about
algorithmsforprogramreferralsisavailableonline(http://www

Measures
Demographics (Baseline)
At baseline, caregivers reported caregiver and child age, care-
giver and child sex, child race/ethnicity, family income, and
caregiver education level and relationship to the child. They
also reported the number of individuals living in the house-
hold, which was used to calculate the federal poverty level.
Social Needs (Baseline and Follow-up)
At baseline and follow-up, caregivers endorsed (yes or no) any
needsthattheirfamilywascurrentlyexperiencingusingastan-
dardized 14-item social and mental health needs screening

ability, food and income security, child care and transporta-
tionneeds,employment,legalconcerns,medicalinsuranceand

to follow-up.
Data Analytic Plan
Although the original analysis plan involved examining pri-
mary and urgent care subgroups separately, data were com-
bined for all analyses because of lower than anticipated enroll-
ment. Differences between navigation intervention and active

tion analyses to account for clustering by enrollment date.

line levels of the outcome. Model 3 also included family
demographic measures, clinic site, and setting.
All analyses were conducted based on an intent-to-treat
principle using all available data with the exception of a sub-
group analysis, which examined navigation intervention arm
effects only for families with at least 1 social need, because no
intervention procedures were provided to families without re-
ported needs. This method is in accord with the Consolidated
Standards of Reporting Trials guidelines for reporting results

The reported number of social needs at baseline ranged
from 0 to 11 out of 14 total possible items (mean [SD], 2.7 [2.2]).
Of 1809 families, 17% (n = 307) did not endorse any needs,
while 20% (n = 362) reported 4 or more needs. The most fre-
quentlyendorsedsocialneedsarelistedinTable2.Forthetotal
sample, these needs included running out of food before hav-
ing money or food stamps to buy more (41.2% [n = 746]), not
having enough money to pay utility bills (41.1% [n = 744]), hav-
ing trouble finding a job (31.0% [n = 561]), not having a place
to live (29.2% [n = 528]), living in an unhealthy environment
(22.7% [n = 411]), and paying medical bills (21% [n = 379]). At
baseline, most of the 1806 caregivers reported child global
health as “excellent” (34.8% [n = 628]) or “very good” (26%
[n = 470]), with 31% (n = 560) identifying the child’
s health as
“good,
”7.3%(n = 131)as“fair,
”and0.9%(n = 17)as“poor.
”Care-
givers in the navigation intervention arm who indicated so-
cial needs participated in a mean (SD) of 1.4 (1.6) (range, 0-13)
follow-up meetings with navigators during the 3 months
after enrollment.
Change in Social Needs Reported by Navigation Intervention
and Active Control Arms
Our hypothesis that navigation intervention arm caregivers
would have fewer social needs at follow-up than active con-
trol arm caregivers was confirmed. We found a significant dif-
ference between arms in the change in social needs from in-
take to follow-up (Table 3). Caregivers in the navigation
intervention arm reported a decrease in their number of so-
cial needs by a mean (SE) of −0.39 (0.13) needs, while care-
givers in the active control arm reported a small increase in the
number of social needs by a mean (SE) of 0.22 (0.13) more
needs, for a mean (SE) cumulative between-group difference
of 0.61 (0.18) needs (P < .001). Adjusting for baseline number
of social needs and clinic and family demographic variables
yielded a similar pattern of results. Pooled estimates of mixed
models using multiple imputation for missing follow-up data
resulted in similar group differences.
Change in Child Global Health
Our second hypothesis, that child health would improve more
in the navigation intervention arm than in the active control
arm,wasalsosupported.Caregiverreportofchildglobalhealth
(in which lower scores represent better health) improved a
mean (SE) of −0.36 (0.05) in the navigation intervention arm
and a mean (SE) of −0.12 (0.05) in the active control arm, re-
sulting in a mean (SE) significant difference of −0.24 (0.07) be-
tweenarms(P < .001).Adjustingforbaselinechildglobalhealth
and family demographic variables continued to yield signifi-
cant intervention group differences (Table 3). Pooled esti-
mates of mixed models using multiple imputation for miss-
ing follow-up data yielded similar group differences. A
subanalysis removing families referred to a social worker re-
sulted in the same pattern of findings for both change in so-
cial needs (β = 0.62; 95% CI, β = 0.28 to 0.89; P < .001) and
childglobalhealth(β = 0.25;95%CI,β = 0.08to0.39;P < .001),
suggesting that the referrals to social workers did not account
for the greater improvements found in the navigation inter-
vention arm. Exploratory analysis of whether reductions in so-
cial needs accounted for intervention effects did not show me-
diation. Although the effect of group on child global health was
reduced, it continued to be a significant predictor after add-
ing change in social needs into the model (β = 0.26; 95% CI,
β = 0.07 to 0.44; P = .006).
Discussion
Demand is growing for interventions that bridge social and
medical care in pediatric clinical settings, including screen-
ing for and addressing unmet social, legal, and mental health
needs of families seen for primary or urgent care.21,22 Evi-
dence that these interventions affect health care quality and
outcomes will accelerate efforts to incorporate them into care
delivery. To our knowledge, this study is the first randomized
clinical trial that includes child health outcomes in an evalu-
ation of pediatric-based interventions designed to link fami-
lies facing unmet social, legal, and mental health needs with
community services.
The prevalence of families’unmet needs identified in the
2 study recruitment hospitals, each of which serves a major-
ity of low-income families, is consistent with work from other
safety-net settings,22,24,28,37 as is the association we found be-
tween baseline social, legal, and mental health needs and par-
ent-reported child global health.9,17,38-41 As the number of so-
cial adversities experienced increased, so did the odds of poor
child health.
Despite the association between social needs and child
health, only 17.8% (322 of 1809) of families recruited for our
studyreportedbeingaskedaboutnonmedicalneedsinahealth
care setting within the past year. We evaluated 2 approaches
to lessening the burden of these adversities, namely, a navi-
gation intervention arm in which caregivers had assistance
from a navigator to access social services and an active con-
trol arm in which they received written information. Families

randomized to the navigation intervention arm experienced
significantly greater decreases in the number of needs and im-
provements in parent-reported child health scores compared
with families randomized to the active control arm. Given that
the active controls were screened and received relevant infor-
mation on community resources, this work is a conservative
test of the effect; an even greater difference might be
expected with a no-treatment control.
Prior research on social screening and interventions in pe-
diatricclinicalsettingshaspredominantlyassessedprocessout-
comes. This work has shown that screening and electronic or
written referral interventions are acceptable to patients, meet
patientdesiresfordiscussion,andincreasefamilycontactwith
and receipt of community resources.21,22,26,27,42
The present study extends this literature by demonstrat-
ing an effect not only on degree of social need but also on child
health in a brief time frame. In-person navigation was shown
to be more effective than written resources given to care-
givers. The intervention relied on a volunteer workforce that
is low cost and potentially scalable to other pediatric health
care settings, although dependent on the availability of vol-
unteers. Navigators averaged fewer than 2 follow-up con-
tacts with patients, which was enough to yield a significantly
greater positive effect on child health. Future work could ex-
aminedoseresponseinsocialinterventions,includingwhether
higher intervention doses have differential effects on spe-
cific social needs or child health outcomes. In addition, over-
all reductions in social needs did not mediate the effects of the
navigation intervention on child health. Future work will also
be needed to better characterize the associations between
changes in specific social needs and health outcomes.
Four limitations of the study should be noted. First is the
use of a single item to assess child health status. While widely
used as an indicator of child health and well-being,30,31,40 a
single-iteminstrumentdoesnotprovideacomprehensiveornu-
anced assessment. Second, despite randomization, the navi-
gationinterventionarmparticipantsreportedmoresocialneeds
on average at baseline, which could be a chance occurrence or
could reflect differential recruitment by navigators on the days
when patients were randomized into the navigation interven-
tionarmratherthantotheactivecontrolarm.Whatevertherea-
son,statisticaladjustmentforthesebaselinedifferencesyielded
comparable results. Third, both the low rate of enrollment and
study attrition may have resulted in bias. We did not find dif-
ferentialattritionbystudyarmonanykeyvariable.Becausethe
American Academy of Pediatrics’recommendations about so-
cialscreeningareincorporatedintocare,weanticipatethatfami-
lies will be more likely to accept these services as part of stan-
dard care delivery. Fourth, although the randomization of
participants was an overall strength of this study, randomiza-
tion by day and the lack of masking of navigators and research
assistants could have biased both enrollment and survey re-
sults. The lack of evidence of differential attrition, along with
finding no difference in the number of follow-up calls needed
to obtain follow-up surveys or in the rates of survey comple-
tion, suggests that systematic biases between the 2 study arms
were unlikely.
Conclusions

urgent care–based social determinants of health interventions

National pediatrics organizations have called for new
delivery models that incorporate social interventions. Few
pediatric patient caregivers and families are now screened for
social risks in health care systems or receive help in address-
ing identified social needs.21 While more work documenting
