IMPORTANCE A recent increase in suicide in the United States has raised public and clinical
interest in determining whether a coincident national increase in suicide attempts has
occurred and in characterizing trends in suicide attempts among sociodemographic and
clinical groups.
OBJECTIVE To describe trends in recent suicide attempts in the United States.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Data came from the 2004-2005 wave 2 National
Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC) and the 2012-2013
NESARC-III. These nationally representative surveys asked identical questions to 69 341
adults, 21 years and older, concerning the occurrence and timing of suicide attempts. Risk
differences adjusted for age, sex, and race/ethnicity (ARDs) assessed trends from the
2004-2005 to 2012-2013 surveys in suicide attempts across sociodemographic and
psychiatric disorder strata. Additive interactions tests compared the magnitude of trends in
prevalence of suicide attempts across levels of sociodemographic and psychiatric disorder
groups. The analyses were performed from February 8, 2017, through May 31, 2017.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Self-reported attempted suicide in the 3 years before the
interview.
RESULTS With use of data from the 69 341 participants (42.8% men and 57.2% women; mean
[SD] age, 48.1 [17.2] years), the weighted percentage of US adults making a recent suicide
attempt increased from 0.62% in 2004-2005 (221 of 34 629) to 0.79% in 2012-2013 (305 of
34 712; ARD, 0.17%; 95% CI, 0.01%-0.33%; P = .04). In both surveys, most adults with recent
suicide attempts were female (2004-2005, 60.17%; 2012-2013, 60.94%) and younger than
50 years (2004-2005, 84.75%; 2012-2013, 80.38%). The ARD for suicide attempts was
significantly larger among adults aged 21 to 34 years (0.48%; 95% CI, 0.09% to 0.87%) than
among adults 65 years and older (0.06%; 95% CI, −0.02% to 0.14%; interaction P = .04). The
ARD for suicide attempts was also significantly larger among adults with no more than a high
school education (0.49%; 95% CI, 0.18% to 0.80%) than among college graduates (0.03%;
95% CI, −0.17% to 0.23%; interaction P = .003); the ARD was also significantly larger among
adults with antisocial personality disorder (2.16% [95% CI, 0.61% to 3.71%] vs 0.07% [95%
CI, −0.09% to 0.23%]; interaction P = .01), a history of violent behavior (1.04% [95% CI,
0.35% to 1.73%] vs 0.00% [95% CI, −0.12% to 0.12%]; interaction P = .003), or a history of
anxiety (1.43% [95% CI, 0.47% to 2.39%] vs 0.18% [95% CI, 0.04% to 0.32%]; interaction
P = .01) or depressive (0.99% [95% CI, −0.09% to 2.07%] vs −0.08% [95% CI, −0.20% to
0.04%]; interaction P = .05) disorders than among adults without these conditions.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE A recent overall increase in suicide attempts among adults in
the United States has disproportionately affected younger adults with less formal education
and those with antisocial personality disorder, anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, and a
history of violence.

 P
reventing suicide is a leading public health1 and
research2 priority. However, despite policy and clini-
cal initiatives aimed at reducing suicide, the rate of sui-
cide in the United States increased by approximately 2% per
year from 2006 to 2014.3 One recognized approach to prevent-
ing suicide involves improving the identification and treat-
ment of individuals at high risk, including those who plan or
attempt suicide.4
Suicide attempts are the most powerful known risk fac-
tor for completed suicide.5-7 During the first year after a sui-
cide attempt, the risk for completed suicide varies from 0.8%
to 3.0% for men and from 0.3% to 1.9% for women.6,8-10 In a
Swedish study,8 the rate of suicide among individuals in the
year after a suicide attempt was nearly 100-fold higher than
the corresponding suicide rate among age- and sex-matched
community control individuals. By 10 years, 5% to 10% of
adults making serious suicide attempts have completed
suicide.9-12 Because 15% to 25% of adults who die by suicide
have received treatment for a suicide attempt within the past
year,11,13,14 a substantial proportion of suicide deaths are po-
tentially subject to prior intervention that could be identified
with a suicide attempt.
Suicide attempts are important clinical events. They are a
majorsourceofdistress,morbidity,andeconomicburden.Most
adults who make suicide attempts have anxiety or mood dis-
orders and many have substance use disorders.15 In addition,
approximately 18% of individuals who attempt suicide make
a second attempt during the following year.16 In 2013, the total
annual estimated economic burden of suicide attempts in the
United States exceeded $8 billion.17
Population-based surveillance of suicide attempts could
help to assess progress in efforts to reduce suicidal behavior.
Several prior reports18-21 have characterized trends in delib-
erate self-harm events among individuals presenting for emer-
gency medical or mental health care. A limitation of these re-
ports is that they provide no information about self-harm
events that do not result in use of health care services. As a
result, relatively little is known about the underlying epide-
miology of suicide attempts and how it may have changed in
recent years. According to the National Longitudinal Alcohol
Epidemiologic Survey and National Epidemiologic Survey on
Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC), the lifetime preva-
lence of suicide attempts among US adults 18 years and older
remained unchanged from 1991 through 1992 to 2001 through
2002 at 2.4%.18 However, an analysis of the National Comor-
bidity Surveys15 revealed that the proportion of adults in the
United States who made a suicide attempt in the past year was
0.4% in 1990 through 1992 and 0.6% in 2001 through 2003.
More recently, the rate of past year suicide attempts was re-
ported as 0.5% among adults according to the 2008-2009 Na-
tional Survey on Drug Use and Health.22
Despite an increase from 2004 to 2014 in the US annual
suicide rate from 11.0 to 13.0 per 100 000 population,3,23
whether a corresponding coincident increase in suicide at-
tempts has occurred remains unknown. If an increase has oc-
curred, a characterization of which groups are at high and in-
creasing risk would help focus prevention and early
intervention initiatives. Therefore, the present report exam-
ines trends in recent suicide attempts among nationally rep-
resentative general population samples collected from 2004
to2005andfrom2012to2013.Becausementaldisorders24and
socioeconomicdisadvantage25havebeenhypothesizedtocon-
tribute to the risk for suicide attempts, we sought to identify
whether recent trends in suicide attempt risk have differen-
tially affected subgroups with common mental disorders that
are often a focus of clinical efforts to reduce suicide risk. Be-
cause an economic downturn occurred during the period un-
der study, we also assessed whether adults with markers of so-
cioeconomic disadvantage, including lower levels of
educational attainment and lower family income, experi-
enced a disproportionate increase in suicide attempt risk dur-
ing this period.
Methods
Sources of Data
The wave 2 NESARC (2004-2005) and NESARC-III (2012-
2013) were separate nationally representative face-to-face in-
terview surveys of 34 653 and 36 309 adults, respectively, re-
siding in households and group quarters (eg, boarding and
group homes) that were conducted by the National Institute
on Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse.26,27 Multistage probability
sampling was used to randomly select respondents. First, pri-
mary sampling units, which consisted of individual counties
or groups of contiguous counties, were selected. Next, sec-
ondary sampling units, which were groups of census-defined
blocks, were selected. In the third stage, households in the
sampled secondary sampling units were selected. This sample
involved random selection of eligible adults in sampled house-
holds.Theanalyticsamplewasrestrictedtoallpersons21years
and older. The 69 341 adult study participants included 34 629
in the 2004-2005 cohort and 34 712 in the 2012-2013 cohort.
The institutional review boards of the National Institutes of
Health and Westat approved the study protocols. All partici-
pants provided electronic informed consent.
Key Points
Questions Has a national increase in suicide attempts occurred in
the United States in the decade since wave 2 of the National
Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions?
Finding In this national epidemiologic survey of 69 341 US adults,
the percentage making a recent suicide attempt increased from
0.62% in 2004 through 2005 to 0.79% in 2012 through 2013. The
adjusted risk differences for suicide attempts were significantly
larger among adults aged 21 to 34 years than among adults aged
65 years or older; adults with no more than a high school
education than among college graduates; and adults with
antisocial personality disorder, a history of violent behavior,
anxiety disorders, or depressive disorders than among adults
without these conditions.
Meaning A recent overall increase in suicide attempts among US
adults has disproportionately affected younger adults with less
formal education and those with antisocial personality disorder,
anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, and a history of violence.

 The overall survey response rate for the wave 2 NESARC
was 70.2%.27 For NESARC-III, the household screener re-
sponse rate was 72.0% with a person-level response rate of
84.0% to yield an overall response of 60.1%, comparable to
rates for other current US surveys.28,29 The samples were
weighted to adjust for nonresponse at the household and per-
son levels, selection of 1 person per household, and over-
sampling of young adults and Hispanic and African American
individuals. After weighting, the data were adjusted to be rep-
resentative of the US population for variables that included re-
gion, age, sex, and race/ethnicity based on the Decennial Cen-
sus and American Community Survey.30
Assessments
Sociodemographic measures included age, sex, race/
ethnicity, marital status, educational attainment, family in-
come,andcurrentemploymentbyself-report.TheAlcoholUse
Disorder and Associated Disabilities Interview Schedule–
DSM-IV version (AUDADIS-IV) was used in NESARC,31 and the
AUDADIS DSM-5 version (AUDADIS-5) was used in
NESARC-III.32 Past-year substance use disorders (alcohol use
disorders and drug use disorders, excluding nicotine depen-
dence), past-year anxiety disorders (panic disorder, general-
ized anxiety disorder, and social phobia), past-year depres-
sive disorders (major depressive disorders and dysthymic
disorder), and lifetime personality disorders (borderline, an-
tisocial, and schizotypal disorders) were assessed by struc-
tured diagnostic interviews. Test-retest reliability of AU-
DADIS-IV is good to excellent for substance use disorders
(κ = 0.51-0.74) and fair to good for other psychiatric disorders
(κ = 0.40-0.67),33-36 whereas reliability of the AUDADIS-5 is
good to excellent for substance use disorders (κ = 0.50-0.85)
andfairtogoodforotherpsychiatricdisorders(κ = 0.35-0.54).37
A series of questions were also asked of respondents to
evaluate whether they had ever engaged in violence, includ-
ing starting a lot of fights, forcing a person to have sex against
their will, swapping blows with a partner, using a weapon in a
fight, hitting a person so hard that they required medical care,
physically hurting another person on purpose, or robbing or
mugging an individual.38 To evaluate suicide attempts, re-
spondents were first asked if they had ever attempted suicide
(“Inyourentirelife,didyoueverattemptsuicide?”).Thosewho
responded affirmatively were asked their age at the first and
mostrecenttimesthattheyattemptedsuicide.Individualswho
indicated that their most recent attempt was within 3 years of
their current age were defined to have made a recent suicide
attempt. A history of suicide attempts was defined as report-
ing that the first suicide attempt occurred more than 3 years
before their current age.
Statistical Analysis
Proportions of 2012-2013 respondents with recent suicide at-
tempts were computed overall and stratified by demographic
and clinical subgroups. Because suicide attempt risk varies by
age, sex, and race/ethnicity,15 multivariable analyses were con-
trolled for these respondent characteristics. Because sociode-
mographiccharacteristics(educationalattainment,maritalsta-
tus, employment, and family income) were conceptualized as
being potentially in the causal pathway of trends in suicide at-
tempts,themultivariableanalyseswerenotcontrolledforthese
variables.
We used χ2 tests to evaluate group differences in demo-
graphicandclinicalcharacteristicsofthe2004-2005and2012-
2013 respondents with recent suicide attempts. Proportions
of individuals with a suicide attempt within the past 3 years
were then compared between the 2 surveys. Risk differences
adjusted for age, sex, and race/ethnicity (ARDs) assessed as-
sociations between the survey periods (2004-2005 vs 2012-
2013) and the risk for a recent suicide attempt. Adjusted risk
differences were obtained from SUDAAN (version 11.0; RTI In-
ternational) software using the predicted marginal approach
that back transforms the estimates from the logistic regres-
sion to the probability scale.39 The independent variable of in-
terest was the survey period effect, with the 2004-2005 sur-
vey as reference. Separate adjusted regression models using
theaveragemarginalpredictionapproach39testedwhetherthe
ARDs significantly varied across different levels of each strati-
fication variable (additive interactions).40 All statistical analy-
ses were performed with SAS (SAS Institute; version 9.4) or
SUDAAN (version 11.0; RTI International) software to accom-
modate the complex sample design and weighting of obser-
vations.
Results
Correlates of Recent Suicide Attempt
Among the total sample of 69 341 study participants, 42.8%
were men, 57.2% were women, and the mean [SD] age was 48.1
[17.2] years. In the 2012-2013 survey, women (0.92%) were
more likely than men (0.64%) to have made a recent suicide
attempt (Table 1). In adjusted analyses, recent suicide at-
tempts were also significantly correlated with younger adults
(adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 12.65; 95% CI, 6.91-23.18); being
widowed, separated, or divorced rather than married or co-
habiting (AOR, 4.09; 95% CI, 2.68-6.24); lower educational at-
tainment (AOR, 4.05; 95% CI, 2.45-6.70); current unemploy-
ment(AOR,3.37;95%CI,2.50-4.55);andalowerleveloffamily
income (AOR, 5.71; 95% CI, 3.43-9.50). Each of the mental dis-
orders, especially borderline (AOR, 13.55; 95% CI, 10.29-
17.85), schizotypal (AOR, 7.12; 95% CI, 5.44-9.33), and antiso-
cial personality disorders (AOR, 6.67; 4.45-10.02), and a prior
suicideattempt(AOR,23.54;95%CI,16.46-33.67)werestrongly
associated with the risk for a recent suicide attempt.
Characteristics of Adults Reporting Recent Suicide Attempts
Adults with recent suicide attempts in both surveys were pre-
dominantly female (60.17% and 60.94%), white (67.89% and
68.92%), and not currently employed (58.30% and 59.37%).
Mental disorders were common. Approximately one-half of
adults with recent suicide attempts reported having made a
prior suicide attempt. In both surveys, nearly two-thirds of
those with recent suicide attempts had borderline personal-
ity disorder. Compared with adults from the 2004-2005 sur-
vey who had recently attempted suicide, those in the 2012-
2013 survey were younger (21 to 34 years of age, 49.98% vs

 41.51%) and more likely have a depressive disorder (53.93% vs
25.52%), antisocial personality disorder (22.90% vs 13.13%),
and a history of violent behavior (55.05% vs 43.52%). In a post
hoc analysis, the proportion of respondents aged 35 to 49 years
with suicide attempts was significantly larger in the 2004-
2005 survey (43.24%) than in 2012-2013 survey (30.40%;
P = .02).Inrelationtotheir2004-2005counterparts,theadults
with suicide attempts in the 2012-2013 survey were also sig-
nificantly less likely to have an anxiety (45.36% vs 60.45%) or
substance use disorder (49.15% vs 61.28%) (Table 2).
Stratified Trends in the Prevalence
of Recent Suicide Attempts
During the study period, the percentage of US adults who re-
ported making a recent suicide attempt increased from 0.62%
in 2004-2005 to 0.79% in 2012-2013 (ARD, 0.17%; 95% CI,
0.01%-0.33%; P = .04) (Table 3). In adjusted trends analyses,
significant risk differences in recent suicide attempts were ob-
served among adults aged 21 to 34 years (ARD, 0.48%; 95% CI,
0.09%-0.87%; P = .02), non-Hispanic white (ARD, 0.24%; 95%
CI, 0.04%-0.44%; P = .02) and black (ARD, 0.28%; 95% CI,
0.01%-0.55%; P = .04) individuals, and adults with no more
than a high school education (ARD, 0.49%; 95% CI, 0.18%-
0.80%; P < .002).
We also tested whether the change across surveys in the
percentagesofadultswhoreportedrecentsuicideattemptsdif-
fered across strata (adjusted additive interaction P values). As
an example, we considered whether the ARD for men (0.13%;
95% CI, −0.07% to 0.33%) was significantly different from that
forwomen(0.21%;95%CI,95%CI,−0.02%to0.44%)(Table3).
In these analyses, the ARD in suicide attempts was signifi-
cantly larger for adults aged 21 to 34 years (0.48%; 95% CI,
0.09% to 0.87%) than for 65 years or older (0.06%; 95% CI,
−0.02% to 0.14%). The increase in risk was also significantly
larger for adults with no more than a high school education
(0.49%;95%CI,0.18%to0.80%)thanforthosewhohadgradu-
ated from college (0.03%; 95% CI, −0.17% to 0.23%).
After controlling for potentially confounding demo-
graphic characteristics, we found significant increases in re-
cent suicide attempts among adults with a history of violent
behavior, antisocial personality disorder, substance use dis-
orders,depressiondisorders,andanxietydisordersandamong
adults without anxiety disorders or substance use disorders
(Table 4). In adjusted models, the increase in suicide attempt
risk was significantly greater among adults with anxiety dis-
orders (1.43% [95% CI, 0.47% to 2.39%] vs 0.18% [95% CI,
0.04% to 0.32%]; interaction P = .01), depressive disorders
(0.99%[95%CI,−0.09%to2.07%]vs−0.08%[95%CI,−0.20%
to 0.04%]; interaction P = .05), antisocial personality disor-
der (2.16% [95% CI, 0.61% to 3.71%] vs 0.07% [95% CI, −0.09%
to 0.23%]; interaction P = .01), and a history of violent behav-
ior (1.04% [95% CI, 0.35% to 1.73%] vs 0.00% [95% CI, −0.12%
to 0.12%]; interaction P = .003) than among adults without
these conditions (Table 4).
Discussion
Between the 2004-2005 and 2012-2013 surveys, recent sui-
cide attempts became increasingly prevalent in the United
States. The increase was particularly evident among young
adults and those with no more than a high school education.

 The increase was also larger among individuals with antiso-
cial personality disorder, a history of violent behavior, anxiety
disorders, and depressive disorders than among those with-
out these conditions. In the 2012-2013 survey, the highest-
riskgroupconsistedofadultswithpriorsuicideattempts.Other
high-risk groups included persons with borderline, schizo-
typal, or antisocial personality disorders and those with anxi-
ety and depressive disorders. These findings highlight an in-
creasing prevalence of suicide attempts and underscore the
prominent role of mental disorders, including personality dis-
orders, in risks for suicide attempts at the population level.
The upward trend in suicide attempts coincided with a na-
tional increase in suicide, although the 2 trends varied across
demographic groups. For example, the risk difference in sui-
cide attempts was greatest among adults aged 21 to 34 years,
whereas the risk differences in suicide during this period were
largest among adults aged 45 to 64 years.3 Although demo-
graphic differences in the risk profiles for suicide attempts and

 completion exist, including age and sex, several clinical risk
factors are similar, including depression, anxiety, and sub-
stance use disorders41,42; genetic risk factors may also be
similar.43 Population-based suicide attempt data comple-
ment traditional suicide mortality as a measure of the na-
tional population burden of self-injurious behavior.
The risk for suicide attempts was elevated among adults
with high levels of economic insecurity, including those who
were unemployed and had low family income and low edu-
cational attainment.44,45 During the period when the NESARC-
IIIsurveydatawerecollectedandthe3prioryears,themonthly
US unemployment rate (7.7%-10.1%) was considerably higher
than the unemployment rate period during and preceding col-
lection of the wave 2 NESARC survey (4.9%-6.3%).46 Young
adults and those with less formal education, 2 groups who ex-
perienced disproportionately large increases in suicide at-
tempt risk during this period, may have been particularly vul-
nerable to economic stress and psychological distress
associated with deterioration in the US economy.
Prior studies examining associations between economic
factors, most commonly unemployment, and suicide47,48
and suicidal behavior49,50 have yielded mixed results across
countries and periods. Contextual factors, such as the gen-
erosity of safety net programs and personal savings rates,
likely account for much of this variation. In the present
study, adults with no more than a high school educational
level experienced a significantly larger increase in suicide
attempt risk than did adults who had graduated from col-
lege. This pattern suggests that these socioeconomically
disadvantaged individuals have borne a disproportionate

 share of risk associated with the recent increase in suicide
attempts. However, because trends in suicide attempt risk
did not significantly vary across family income level or cur-
rent employment status, the recent recession did not seem
to influence suicide attempt risk in a predictable manner.
Consistent with prior research on emergency department–
treated deliberate self-harm events,18-21 recent suicide at-
tempts in this nationally representative sample of community-
dwelling adults were more common among women than men
and decreased with age. During the study period, the risk for
attempting suicide increased for young adults but did not sig-
nificantly increase for middle-aged or older adults. Together
with a recently reported national increase in the prevalence
of major depressive episodes among young adults,51 the in-
crease in risk for suicide attempts among young adults sig-
nals the importance of focusing on early detection of mental
health risk factors of suicidal behavior and treatment initia-
tives in this age group.
In both surveys, nearly two-thirds of adults with recent
suicide attempts had borderline personality disorder. This
high proportion may in part reflect the broad spectrum of
self-harm behaviors captured by the suicide attempt survey
item. Adults with borderline personality disorder have been
previously found to be at increased risk for completed
suicide.52 Because borderline personality disorder is charac-
terized by “recurrent suicidal behavior, gestures, or
threats,
”53(p663) the strong correlation with suicidal behavior
is not surprising. A high prevalence of suicide attempts com-
bined with a tendency of some front-line clinicians to hold
negative views of borderline personality disorder54 under-
scores the importance of developing clinician training pro-
grams to help improve the management of deliberate self-
harm among patients with this condition.55 One encouraging
finding is that although most adults in the 2012-2013 survey
who had recent suicide attempts had borderline personality
disorder, the risk of attempted suicide among adults with
borderline personality disorder significantly decreased dur-
ing the study period. This trend may reflect increasing
access to more effective interventions for impulsivity in bor-
derline personality disorder. A survey of US psychiatric resi-

 dency programs revealed that 40.8% of programs currently
offer training in dialectical behavior therapy for borderline
personality disorder.56
A substantial and increasing proportion of adults who at-
tempted suicide met criteria for antisocial personality disor-
der. Although individuals with antisocial personality disor-
derareoftenperceivedashavingahighriskforviolentbehavior
toward others,57 they also commonly have a history of sui-
cide attempts.58 In prospective research, adults with antiso-
cial personality disorder and other externalizing psychopatho-
logic features have been reported to be at increased risk for
attempting suicide.59 Antisocial behaviors may also be asso-
ciated with increased risk for suicide.60 Although suicidal be-
haviors are typically considered in relation to depression and
other internalizing disorders, associations between antiso-
cial personality disorder and attempted suicide challenge this
stereotype. Future clinical research is needed to clarify the so-
cial context, triggers, and motivation for suicidal behavior in
this population.
Limitations
In interpreting these findings, several limitations apply.
First, the NESARC surveys rely on retrospective self-reports.
Responses may be affected by inaccuracies in the recall of
the timing of events or the intention of self-harm events.
However, we have no reason to believe that recall inaccura-
cies differentially affected the 2 surveys or that memory of
suicide attempts is easily perturbed by recall bias. Second,
suicide attempts were assessed with a single survey item
that likely captured a wide range of behaviors, including
interrupted, aborted, and potentially lethal and nonlethal
attempts. Third, we have no means of assessing the influ-
ence of changes in the effectiveness of life-saving emer-
gency management of suicide attempts. Fourth, the
NESARC does not survey homeless or incarcerated adults,
who have relatively high rates of suicidal behavior,61,62 nor
does it include an assessment of schizophrenia. Fifth, minor
modifications between DSM-IV and DSM-5 criteria may
have biased results of trends in suicide attempts among
adults meeting criteria for the various mental disorders,63
although these modifications do not influence the overall
trends in suicide attempts or associations with sociodemo-
graphic characteristics. Sixth, some important characteris-
tics, such as residence in a rural or urban location,64 were
not available. Seventh, to increase sample size, a 3-year
rather than a 1-year period was used to define recent suicide
attempts; this would be expected to attenuate associations
with past-year mental disorders. Finally, the surveys did not
collect data from individuals who died of suicide. This lack
may have led to an underestimation of suicide attempts in
each survey.65
Conclusions
From the 2004-2005 to the 2012-2013 surveys, a national in-
crease in recent suicide attempts occurred. Because at-
tempted suicide is the greatest known risk factor for com-
pleted suicide,6,10 reducing suicide attempts is an important
public health and clinical goal. The pattern of suicide at-
tempts supports a clinical and public health focus on younger,
socioeconomicallydisadvantagedadults,especiallythosewith
a history of suicide attempts and common personality, mood,
and anxiety disorders.
