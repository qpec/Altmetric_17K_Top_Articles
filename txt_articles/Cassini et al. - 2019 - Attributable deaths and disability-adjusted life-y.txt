Summary
Background Infections due to antibiotic-resistant bacteria are threatening modern health care. However, estimating 
their incidence, complications, and attributable mortality is challenging. We aimed to estimate the burden of infections 
caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria of public health concern in countries of the EU and European Economic Area 
(EEA) in 2015, measured in number of cases, attributable deaths, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs).
Methods We estimated the incidence of infections with 16 antibiotic resistance–bacterium combinations from 
European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network (EARS-Net) 2015 data that was country-corrected for 
population coverage. We multiplied the number of bloodstream infections (BSIs) by a conversion factor derived from 
the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control point prevalence survey of health-care-associated infections 
in European acute care hospitals in 2011–12 to estimate the number of non-BSIs. We developed disease outcome 
models for five types of infection on the basis of systematic reviews of the literature.
Findings From EARS-Net data collected between Jan 1, 2015, and Dec 31, 2015, we estimated 671 689 (95% uncertainty 
interval [UI] 583 148–763 966) infections with antibiotic-resistant bacteria, of which 63·5% (426 277 of 671 689) were 
associated with health care. These infections accounted for an estimated 33 110 (28 480–38 430) attributable deaths 
and 874 541 (768 837–989 068) DALYs. The burden for the EU and EEA was highest in infants (aged <1 year) and 
people aged 65 years or older, had increased since 2007, and was highest in Italy and Greece.
Interpretation Our results present the health burden of five types of infection with antibiotic-resistant bacteria 
expressed, for the first time, in DALYs. The estimated burden of infections with antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the EU 
and EEA is substantial compared with that of other infectious diseases, and has increased since 2007. Our burden 
estimates provide useful information for public health decision-makers prioritising interventions for infectious 
diseases.

Introduction
Infections due to antibiotic-resistant bacteria are a threat 
to modern health care and have triggered the de- 
velopment of coordinated and comprehensive national, 
European, and global actions plans.1,2 As outlined in 
these action plans, monitoring and evaluating in- 
terventions requires robust information on the incidence 
of infections with antibiotic-resistant bacteria and their 
effect on the health of populations; however, such 
information is scarce.3 This information would also be 
useful to set priorities, across and within countries, and 
model future scenarios.4
Data from the European Antimicrobial Resistance 
Surveillance Network (EARS-Net) are relevant when 
monitoring trends in the EU and European Economic 
Area (EEA), but do not give the full epidemiological 
picture, in particular for monitoring the effect of the 
European action plan.
There are several challenges when estimating the 
burden of disease associated with infections due to 
antibiotic-resistant bacteria. For example, sampling and 
micro 
biological procedures for testing of the isolates, data 
collection processes, and the structures of surveillance 
systems might vary between and within countries. 
Furthermore, knowledge of the clinical and public health 
consequences of infections with antibiotic-resistant 
bacteria in humans is still scarce. In particular, scientific 
debate is ongoing on the appropriate epidemiologi-
cal study design and statistical inference methods to 
measure reliable estimates of untoward clinical out-
comes attri 
butable to infections with antibiotic-resistant 
bacteria.3,4

Previous studies estimating the burden of infections 
with antibiotic-resistant bacteria were restricted by the 
number of included bacteria or type of infections.5 In this 
study, we aimed to estimate the burden of infections due 
to selected antibiotic-resistant bacteria of public health 
importance in the EU and EEA in 2015, based on a 
country-specific evaluation of available surveillance data 
and on scientific evidence on attributable clinical out-
comes (deaths, length of stay, risk of developing sequelae 
and their duration, attributable to the infections [yes or 
no]). We measured burden as the number of cases of all 
types of infections with antibiotic-resistant bacteria, the 
number of deaths attributable to these infections and, for 
the first time, the resulting number of disability-adjusted 
life-years (DALYs).
Methods
Overview
The study focused on the eight bacterial species 
frequently isolated from blood or cerebrospinal fluid 
(invasive isolates) in the EU and EEA in 2015 and 
reported to the EARS-Net. Other criteria considered were 
inclusion in the European Centre for Disease Prevention 
and Control (ECDC) point prevalence survey of 
health-care-associated infections and antimicrobial use 
(2011–12) and inclusion in the list of EU antibiotic 
resistance policy indicators in the ECDC, European Food 
Safety Authority, and European Medicines Agency Joint 
Scientific Opinion, and consideration of emerging 
threats (eg, colistin resistance).6 The included anti-
biotic resistance-bacterium combinations were colistin-
resistant, carbapenem-resistant, or multidrug-resistant 
Acinetobacter spp; vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus 
faecalis and Enterococcus faecium; colistin-resistant, 
carbapenem-resistant, or third-generation cephalosporin-
resistant Escherichia coli; colistin-resistant, carbapenem-
resistant, or third-generation cephalosporin-resistant 
Klebsiella pneumoniae; colistin-resistant, carbapenem-
resistant, or multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa; 
meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA); and 
penicillin-resistant and macrolide-resistant Streptococcus 
pneumoniae. Full details are provided in the appendix 
(p 197). We included all five types of infection: blood-
stream infections (BSIs), urinary tract infections, res-
piratory tract infections, surgical site infections, and 
other infections.
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Estimates of the incidence, attributable mortality, attributable 
length of stay, and attributable disability-adjusted life-years 
(DALYs) of all infection types with antibiotic-resistant bacteria 
are scarce. We searched PubMed for articles published between 
inception and Aug 1, 2018, using the terms “burden” and 
“antimicrobial resistance”, with no language restrictions. 
We found 25 relevant peer-reviewed publications. Previous 
studies estimating the burden of infections with 
antibiotic-resistant bacteria were either restricted in their 
geographical scope, number of infections, or types of 
infections. Reports were published by the European Centre for 
Disease Prevention and Control in 2009, the US Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention in 2013, and the UK Review on 
Antimicrobial Resistance in 2014, but these were not 
peer-reviewed. Challenges when estimating the incidence of 
diseases include poor availability of data, heterogeneous 
sampling and microbiological procedures for testing of the 
isolates, data collection processes, and differences on how 
surveillance systems are structured. Moreover, quantifying the 
risk of death or other clinical outcomes following an infection 
with an antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which generally occurs in 
patients affected by other diseases, is challenging and its 
attribution is debateable. To our knowledge, data on the burden 
of infections with antibiotic-resistant bacteria expressed by a 
composite health measure to compare with the effect of other 
diseases, have not been published to date.
Added value of this study
EU and European Economic Area (EEA) countries report data to 
the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network 
(EARS-Net) on bloodstream infections with antibiotic-resistant 
bacteria in a coherent and standardised manner. On the basis of 
EARS-Net data, we developed a step-wise approach, involving 
other data sources (such as the European Centre for Disease 
Prevention and Control point prevalence survey of 
health-care-associated infections and antimicrobial use in 
European acute care hospitals in 2011–12), to determine the 
country-specific incidence of infections with antibiotic-resistant 
bacteria of public health importance in 2015. We did systematic 
reviews of the literature, including a standardised approach to 
the selection and extraction of the evidence, to inform the 
attributable mortality and attributable length of stay of each 
antibiotic resistance–bacterium combination. Finally, Monte 
Carlo simulations on 2400 disease models provided estimates 
of DALYs, which could be placed within the general context of 
the burden of other diseases.
Implications of all the available evidence
The estimated burden of infections with antibiotic-resistant 
bacteria in the EU and EEA was similar to the cumulative burden 
of influenza, tuberculosis, and HIV, was notably diverse across 
countries, and has increased between 2007 and 2015. 
Strategies to prevent and control antibiotic-resistant bacteria 
require coordination at EU and EEA and global levels, and 
interventions that are tailored to national and local challenges. 
Our finding that most of the estimated burden was in hospitals 
and other health-care settings suggests the urgent need to 
address antimicrobial resistance as a patient safety issue and 
the need for alternative treatment options for patients with 
such infections who have comorbidities or are otherwise 
vulnerable (eg, because of their poor immune system or age).

Study design and population
We adapted this study from the Burden of Communicable 
Diseases in Europe (BCoDE) project,7 which aimed to 
estimate DALYs and was specific to bacterium, type of 
antibiotic resistance, type of infection, and was based on 
incidence. We used the Global Burden of Disease 2010 
(GBD 2010) standard life expectancy table.8 Years lived 
with disabilities (YLD) include the length of time lived 
with disabilities (duration) multiplied by disability 
weights reflecting the ill health incurred; the latter were 
derived from the European disability weight project.9
We downloaded data in aggregate format by specific 
age and sex strata, without any personal identifiers, and 
did not require informed consent from participants. 
The checklist from the Guidelines for Accurate and 
Transparent Health Estimates Reporting is shown in the 
appendix (pp 219–21).
We developed a four-step approach to estimate the 
incidence of infections with antibiotic-resistant bacteria 
for five types of infection and in each of the 30 countries 
in the EU and EEA (appendix pp 191–211). Greece did not 
report data on S pneumoniae isolates to EARS-Net.
Disease models and attributable mortality
To account for all notable disabilities related to infections 
with the selected antibiotic-resistant bacteria, we developed 
disease models (or outcome trees) on the basis of published 
evidence. The baseline models for the five types of 
infection were expounded from a previous study that 
aimed to estimate the burden of health-care-associated 
infections,10 with improvements such as the inclusion 
of the effect of comorbidities on long-term sequelae 
(appendix, pp 168–90).
We did a systematic review of peer-reviewed publications 
on the attributable case fatality and attributable length of 
stay of infections with antibiotic-resistant bacteria for each 
selected antibiotic resistance-bacterium combination and 
each type of infection. The literature search focused on the 
effects attributable to these infections compared with a 
matched non-infected population or to a population 
infected with susceptible isolates of the same bacteria. Full 
details on the methodology, search strategy, results, and 
extraction tables are given in the appendix (pp 3–141).
The results of the literature review were critically 
reviewed by five authors (AC, DP, CS, LDH, and AH) 
who scored the publications according to a defined set of 
applicability criteria (appendix pp 142–67). Two authors 
(AC and DP) discussed and agreed on the best summary 
estimate for each outcome parameter (mortality and 
length of stay; appendix pp 3–141). The final health 
outcome parameter values of each of the disease models 
are summarised in the appendix (p 176).
Estimation of incidence
First, using data reported to EARS-Net, we extracted the 
age-specific and sex-specific annual number of infections 
with antibiotic-resistant bacteria in 2015 in each EU and 
EEA country. For each antibiotic resistance-bacterium 
combination, unknown age and sex data were re-
distributed by imputation.
Second, the ECDC National Focal Points for anti-
microbial resistance and for health-care-associated 
infections were asked to report on the estimated country 
population coverage (including its uncertainties [appendix 
pp 198–99]) for each bacterium, reflecting the estimated 
national population coverage. We applied these country 
coverage correction factors to the number of cases 
reported to EARS-Net to estimate the total number of BSIs 
due to each selected combination of antibiotic resistance 
and bacterium.
Third, we adjusted the country coverage-corrected 
number of BSIs from EARS-Net with a multiplier 
reflecting the ratio of BSIs to non-BSIs for each antibiotic 
resistance–bacterium combination and derived from 
the ECDC point prevalence survey 2011–12.11 For each 
antibiotic-resistant bacterium, we applied the BSIs to 
non-BSIs ratio to the numbers from step two to estimate 
the number of urinary tract infections, respiratory tract 
infections, surgical site infections, and other infections. 
Finally, we deducted the percentage of secondary BSIs 
from each of the non-BSIs.
The same method used for the present study was 
also applied to the European Antimicrobial Resistance 
Surveillance System data for 2007
. Information on 2007 
self-reported country coverage was retrieved from the 
authors of the ECDC–EMEA 2009 report12 on the 
burden of multidrug-resistant bacteria in the EU and 
EEA. For comparison, the 2015 results were adjusted 
to include the same antibiotic resistance–bacterium 
combinations and countries, and by standardising the 
populations according to the Eurostat revised standard 
population.13
Computational analysis and uncertainty
We inserted the final designs of the outcome trees into a 
custom version of the BCoDE modelling toolkit.14 For 
each antibiotic-resistant bacterium, five models (one for 
each type of infection) were made, resulting in 80 disease 
models that repeated for each EU and EEA country, 
totalling 2400 models. We entered the sex-specific and 
age group-specific annual number of cases of infection 
with the selected antibiotic-resistant bacteria in each 
model.
Disease model parameters are given with 95% un- 
certainty intervals (UIs), which were included in the 
calculations as uniform distribution (two parameters; 
minimum and maximum) or PERT distribution (three 
parameters; minimum, maximum, and most likely).15 To 
calculate 95% uncertainty intervals, each model was run 
at 10 000 iterations of Monte Carlo simulations. We did 
not use time discounting and age weighting.
Modelling outputs included the annual number of cases 
and incidence rate, the number of attributable deaths 
and attributable mortality rate, the number of DALYs

(including years of life lost [YLLs] and YLDs), and DALY 
rate. We calculated values per 100 000 population. For each 
output, we calculated the median estimate and 95% UI on 
the basis of the input uncertainties. We standardised 
country-specific results by age group according to the 
Eurostat revised standard population.13
Attribution to health care and analysis of MRSA
We estimated the proportion of infections with health-
care-associated antibiotic-resistant bacteria on the basis 
of various assumptions and epidemiological data 
(appendix pp 216–17). We further analysed results for 
MRSA infections to explore the apparent contradiction 
between the declining proportions of MRSA among 
S aureus infections as reported to the European 
Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System and 
EARS-Net between 2007 and 2015, and the results of this 
study (appendix pp 218–19).

Results
From EARS-Net data collected between Jan 1, 2015, and 
Dec 31, 2015, we estimated that 671 689 (95% UI 
583 148–763 966) cases of infections with selected 
antibiotic-resistant bacteria occurred in 2015 in the 
EU and EEA (table 1). These infections accounted for 
33 110 (28 480–38 430) attributable deaths and 874 541 
(768 837–989 068) DALYs. These estimates correspond 
-
ed to an incidence of 131 (113–149) infections per 
100 000 population and an attributable mortality of 
6·44 (5·54–7·48) deaths per 100 000 population, causing 
170 (150–192) DALYs per 100 000 population. YLLs 
accounted for 85·3% (145 of 170) and BSIs for 71·7% 
(122 of 170) of total DALYs, suggesting that the attributable 
mortality estimates affect the final results the most, in 
particular for BSIs.
67·9% (115 of 170) of the total DALYs per 100 000 were 
caused by infections with four antibiotic-resistant 
bacteria with the largest effect on health in our study: 
third-generation cephalosporin-resistant E coli, MRSA, 
carbapenem-resistant P aeruginosa, and third-generation

cephalosporin-resistant K pneumoniae (table 1). Infections 
with colistin-resistant or carbapenem-resistant bacteria 
accounted for 38·7% (65·9 of 170) of the total DALYs per 
100 000. A greater proportion of the estimated total 
number of DALYs occurred in men (535 032 [61·2%] 
of 874 541) than in women (table 1), ranging from 43·6% 
(2006 of 874 541) for colistin-resistant E coli to 72·3% 
(2396 of 874 541) for colistin-resistant Acinetobacter spp 
in men.
Figure 1 shows the association between the number of 
cases, the number of attributable deaths, and the DALYs 
for each antibiotic resistance combination. The ranking of 
infections with antibiotic-resistant bacteria might differ 
depending on which indicator is used for measuring their 
health burden. Despite its relatively low incidence, 
carbapenem-resistant K pneumoniae had a high burden of 
disease because of its high attributable mortality, whereas 
vancomycin-resistant E faecalis and E faecium (which had a 
similar incidence to carbapenem-resistant K pneumoniae) 
was associated with a low burden of disease.
The total burden of infections with selected antibiotic-
resistant bacteria was highest in infants (aged <1 year), 
followed by those aged 65 years or older (figure 2).
We estimated that 63·5% (426 277 of 671 689) of cases of 
infections with antibiotic-resistant bacteria were associated 
with health care, resulting in 72·4% (23 976 of 33 110) of 
attributable deaths and 74·9% (127 of 180) of DALYs per 
100 000 population. This finding suggests that the health 
effects of infections with antibiotic-resistant bacteria 
predominantly occur in hospitals and other health-care 
settings.
Italy and Greece had a substantially higher estimated 
burden of antibiotic-resistant bacteria than other EU and 
EEA countries, with carbapenem-resistant or colistin-
resistant bacteria causing a larger proportion of the total 
burden in Greece than it did in Italy (figure 3). In 2015,

in addition to a substantial burden due to infections 
with carbapenem-resistant or colistin-resistant bacteria, 
Portugal and Malta had a substantial burden due to MRSA 
infections. In Ireland, vancomycin-resistant E faecalis and 
E faecium caused a higher proportion of the total burden 
than in other countries. In Spain and Slovenia, a higher 
proportion of their burden estimates were due to 
antibiotic-resistant S pneumoniae infections than in other 
countries.
The burden of infections with antibiotic-resistant 
bacteria was focused in the southern and eastern part of 
the EU and EEA (figure 4). In Croatia, Bulgaria, and 
Hungary more than 40% of the burden was due to 
infections with carbapenem-resistant or colistin-resistant 
bacteria, but the total burden in these countries was similar 
to the EU and EEA average. More detailed information on 
results per country is shown in the appendix (pp 222–55).
The estimated age-standardised number of cases of 
infections with antibiotic-resistant bacteria was 239 238 
(95% UI 215 544–262 951) in 2007, which increased to 
602 609 (524 237–686 497) in 2015 (table 2). The median 
number of attributable deaths increased from 11 144 
(9999–12 407) in 2007 to 27 249 (23 544–31 471) in 2015. The 
burden of carbapenem-resistant K pneumoniae increased 
the most (by 6·16 times) in terms of number of infect-
ions and number of deaths, followed by carbapenem-
resistant E coli, third-generation cephalosporin-resistant 
E coli, and third-generation cephalosporin-resistant 
K pneumoniae. The number of deaths attributable to 
third-generation cephalosporin-resistant E coli infections 
increased by 4·12 times during 2007–15, increasing to 
8750 (7505–10 262).
Although the EU and EEA population-weighted pro- 
portion of MRSA among S aureus isolates report-
ed to EARS-Net decreased from 26·6% in 2007 
(Diaz Högberg L, European Centre for Disease Prevention 
and Control, personal communication) to 16·8% in 2015, 
our study found that the estimated incidence of MRSA 
infections increased by 1·28 times (95% UI 1·11–1·47). 
The estimated age-specific incidence of MRSA in 2007 
and 2015 showed that incidence mainly increased in 
infants and in people aged 55 years or older; appendix 
p 217). In adults, the estimated incidence decreased during 
2007–15, although this decrease was not significant.
Discussion
To our knowledge, this study is the first to estimate the 
burden of all types of infections with antibiotic-resistant 
bacteria expressed in DALYs. We aimed to provide reliable 
data for population health indicators, through a com-
prehensive and evidence-based approach, for planning, 
prioritisation, and to inform policy for control and 
prevention of this increasing public health threat. 
Moreover, DALYs allow for comparisons with the burden 
of other diseases and our incidence-based approach helps 
to assess the effect of future prevention and control 
interventions.16
Our findings show that all age groups are affected by 
infections with antibiotic-resistant bacteria, although 
their burden is significantly higher among infants than in 
any other age group. Among adults, the burden increases 
with age, suggesting that the ageing EU and EEA 
population could result in an increasing burden. In adults 
and young adults, a higher proportion of the burden was 
caused by infections with carbapenem-resistant and 
colistin-resistant bacteria. This finding might be due to a 
lower risk of complications after an infection in this age 
group in general, except for patients who are often 
admitted to hospital and have difficult-to-treat infections 
because of carbapenem or colistin resistance.
Our finding of 170 DALYs per 100 000 population is 
similar to the combined burden of three major infectious 
diseases (influenza, tuberculosis, and HIV), which was 
183 DALYs per 100 000 population.17 We estimated that 
about 75% of the total burden of infections with antibiotic-
resistant bacteria in EU and EEA countries (ie, 127 DALYs 
per 100 000 population) were associated with health care.

This estimation would mean, if compared with a previous 
study on the burden of health-care-associated infections in 
the EU and EEA,10 that 25% (127 of 501 DALYs per 100 000) 
of the burden of health-care-associated infections is due to 
such infections with antibiotic-resistant bacteria selected 
for our study. However, given the differences in the data 
sources and methods used to estimate the incidence of 
infections, this comparison should be considered with 
caution.
In 2013, the US Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention published the first estimates of the burden of 
infections with antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the USA, 
based on 2011 national surveillance data.18 Our study 
estimated a 2·6 times higher incidence of infect-
ions with antibiotic-resistant bacteria (131 cases per 
100 000 population), although attributable mortality was 
only 1·22 times higher in our study. This increase is due 
to our conservative approach when defining case fatality 
of infections with antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The 
structures and resources that are available for the 
prevention and control of infections with antibiotic-
resistant bacteria might have also caused differences, 
particularly in health care.
In 2016, a study19 estimated the morbidity and mortality 
associated with antibiotic-resistant bacteria in France 
based on 2012 EARS-Net data. We used a similar 
methodology and found a similar incidence for France. 
Nevertheless, we estimated fewer MRSA infections, which 
can partly be explained by the decreasing trends in MRSA 
infections in France between 2012 and 2015, and much 
fewer carbapenem-resistant P aeruginosa infections (fewer 
than 50% of the number in the French study). We also 
estimated half the number of attributable deaths as in the 
French study, because of the reduced case fatality 
proportion stemming from our literature review.
Between 2007 and 2015, the burden increased for all 
antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The proportion of the DALYs 
due to all carbapenem-resistant bacteria combined 
increased from 18% (56 150 of 311 715) in 2007 to 
28% (185 421 of 678 845) in 2015, and the proportion of the 
DALYs due to carbapenem-resistant K pneumoniae and 
carbapenem-resistant E coli combined doubled from 
4·3% (13 515 of 311 715) in 2007 to 8·79% (57 536 of 678 845) 
in 2015, reflecting the emergence and rapid increase of 
carbapenem-resistant K pneumoniae infections in the EU 
and EEA during this period.
We were initially surprised to find that the incidence of 
MRSA infections increased between 2007 and 2015, given 
that the proportion of MRSA over meticillin-susceptible 
S aureus had decreased. This increase could be because of

the increased reporting of S aureus BSI overall from 
30 027 cases in 2007 to 45 364 cases in 2015. Further 
analysis of the age group-specific incidence of MRSA 
infections in 2007 and 2015 showed that the increase was 
mainly seen in infants and people aged 55 years or older 
(appendix p 217). The elderly population is more vulnerable 
to MRSA infections20 and this population has grown since 
2007; the improvement of neonatal services, leading to an 
increased survival of at-risk infants, might have also 
contributed to further increasing the size of the population 
at risk for MRSA infection. Studies in Sweden,21 Finland,22 
and Norway,23 have also found that incidence of MRSA did 
not decrease in these countries.
Italy and Greece have the greatest burden of infections 
due to antibiotic-resistant bacteria or a combined 
21·3% (171 899 of 874 541) of the EU and EEA total DALYs 
per 100 000 population and 36·2% (319 019 of 874 541) of 
EU and EEA DALYs per 100 000 population due to 
carbapenem-resistant or colistin-resistant bacteria. Even if 
one considers its large and ageing population, it is notable 
that about a third of the deaths due to infections with 
antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the EU and EEA were in 
Italy. Italy has published its National Action Plan on 
Antimicrobial Resistance 2017–20,24 which includes targets 
for the reduction of antibiotic use and the control of health-
care-associated infections. Greece published its National 
Action Plan (known as Procrustes) in 2010, which outlined 
the best practices for monitoring and preventing infections 
due to carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria.25 
Given that, in 2015, most of the burden in Greece was due 
to infections with carbapenem-resistant or colistin-
resistant bacteria (overall case fatality proportion of 8·80), 
there is an urgent need to expand the measures to contain 
carbapenem-resistant bacteria in this country.
Our results are consistent with the European survey 
on carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae, which 
highlighted the geographical heterogeneity of carba- 
penemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae in the EU and 
EEA, and the endemic situation in Italy and Greece,26 
where the incidence of such infections per 100 000 patient-
days was the highest of all EU and EEA countries.27 
Grundmann and colleagues27 reported a ratio of 
11 to one for K pneumoniae to E coli carbapenemase-
producing bacteria; our study also found a higher number 
of carbapenem-resistant K pneumoniae than carbapenem-
resistant E coli (ratio six to one).
Considering that, in our study, a large proportion of 
the burden was due to health-care-associated blood-
stream, respiratory tract, or surgical site infections, and 
that more than half of health-care-associated infections 
are considered preventable,28 reducing the burden of 
antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the EU and EEA through 
enhanced infection prevention and control measures 
could be an achievable goal. ECDC recently published 
guidance on infection prevention and control measures 
and tools for the prevention of the spread of carbapenem-
resistant Enterobacteriaceae in hospitals or other 
health-care settings.29 Stewardship interventions can be 
successful at safely reducing unnecessary use of 
antibiotics in hospitals.30
A substantial proportion of the burden of infections with 
antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the EU and EEA in 2015 was 
estimated to have been due to community-associated 
infections. This finding suggests that antimicrobial 
stewardship targeting prescribers and infection prevention 
and control interventions in primary care would also be 
necessary to reduce the burden of these infections in the 
EU and EEA.
Our study has several limitations. The disease models 
were based on the data retrieved from systematic literature 
reviews, which varied in availability, quality, and 
representativeness of evidence. We did not grade the 
strength of evidence supporting each parameter estimate 
on the basis of the statistical analysis methods used in the 
clinical outcome studies. Moreover, death from an 
infection with antibiotic-resistant bacteria is the result of 
many factors that are related to the pathogen, patient, and 
therapy, in particular regarding the delay in the 
administration of appropriate antibiotic therapy.4 We did 
not adjust our models for age-specific risks, co-infections, 
appropriateness of antibiotic therapy, or for type of care, 
assuming common transition probabilities for all 
subgroups. However, to cover uncertainties related to 
the different patient case-mix, we considered studies 
focusing on specific populations for inclusion in the 
parameters of the disease models (appendix pp 168–90), 
and included when pertinent.
In the appendix (p 203), we list the limitations related to 
the method of estimating the incidence of infections from 
EARS-Net data, including frequency of susceptibility 
testing and representativeness of participating laboratories 
(geographical, type of hospital, and case-mix of patients). 
ECDC is currently working with countries in the evaluation 
of all factors affecting the EARS-Net country coverage. We 
also list limitations related to the factors used for converting 
the number of BSIs to other types of infection (appendix 
p 203), including the different time span of the ECDC 
point prevalence survey (2011–12) and EARS-Net, applica-
tion of data from the point prevalence survey to 
community-associated infections, dependence of health-
care-associated infections on the day of measurement, and 
estimation of non-BSIs (might have been affected by the 
case-mix of patients and could differ between hospitals). 
Finally, we defined multidrug-resistant isolates (appendix 
p 196) on the basis of antibiotic groups frequently used for 
empirical treatment of BSI as included in EARS-Net. 
Nevertheless, our definition might not reflect the available 
options for treatment in each individual case.
The strength of this study is the high quality of the 
surveillance data sources. EARS-Net and ECDC point 
prevalence survey 2011–12 are the most comprehensive, 
standardised, multi-country surveillance initiatives to date 
for antibiotic-resistant bacteria and health-care-associated 
infections. Another strength was the use of systematic

literature reviews to determine the best available estimates 
of attributable mortality, attributable length of stay, and 
attributable short-term and long-term complications of 
infections.
To our knowledge, this study estimated for the first time 
the burden of five types of infection with antibiotic-
resistant bacteria in the EU and EEA expressed in DALYs 
and provided reliable EU and EEA and country-specific 
profiles for 2015 data.
The estimated burden of infections with antibiotic-
resistant bacteria in the EU and EEA is substantial 
compared with that of other infectious diseases, and has 
increased since 2007
. Strategies to prevent and control 
antibiotic-resistant bacteria require coordination at EU and 
EEA and global level. However, our study showed that the 
contribution of various antibiotic-resistant bacteria to the 
overall burden varies greatly between countries, thus 
highlighting the need for prevention and control strategies 
that are tailored to the needs of each country in the EU and 
EEA. Our study also showed that most of the burden of 
infections with antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the EU and 
EEA was health care associated, thus emphasising the 
need to urgently address antimicrobial resistance as a 
patient safety issue and the need for alternative treatment 
options for patients with such infections who have co-
morbidities or are otherwise vulnerable (eg, because of 
their poor immune system or age).
Future studies should include estimates of the burden of 
infections due to other antibiotic-resistant bacteria 
of public health importance, such as drug-resistant 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis, drug-resistant Salmonella spp, 
and drug-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae, to give a more 
comprehensive estimate of the burden of antimicrobial 
resistance. In the long term, research should be done to 
better understand the factors underlying the estimations 
of EARS-Net country coverage, such as catchment 
population, patient case-mix, laboratory capacity, and the 
appropriateness and frequency of collection of blood 
cultures.
