ABSTRACT 
 
Regulatory T cells (Treg) are critical for maintaining self-tolerance and immune 
homeostasis, but their suppressive function can impede effective antitumor 
immune responses. FOXP3 is a transcription factor expressed in Tregs that is required for their func-
tion. However, the pathways and microenvironmental cues governing FOXP3 expression and Treg func-
tion are not completely understood. Herein, we report that YAP, a coactivator of the Hippo pathway, 
is highly expressed in Tregs and bolsters FOXP3 expression and Treg function  
in vitro 
 and  
in vivo. 
 This 
potentiation stemmed from YAP-dependent upregulation of activin signaling 
, which amplifi
 es TGFβ/
SMAD activation in Tregs. YAP defi
 ciency resulted in dysfunctional Tregs unable to suppress antitumor 
immunity or promote tumor growth in mice. Chemical YAP antagonism and knockout or blockade of the 
YAP-regulated activin receptor similarly improved antitumor immunity. Thus, we identify YAP as an 
unexpected amplifi
 er of a Treg-reinforcing pathway with signifi
 cant potential as an anticancer immu-
notherapeutic target. 
 
SIGnIFICAnCE: 
 Tregs suppress antitumor immunity, and pathways supporting their function can be 
novel immunotherapy targets. Here, the selective expression of YAP by Tregs, its importance for their 
function, and its unexpected enhancement of pro-Treg Activin/SMAD signaling are reported, as are 
validations of potential cancer-fi
 ghting antagonists of YAP and its regulatory targets.

INTRODUCTION 
 
Regulatory T cells (Treg) play critical roles in promoting 
immunologic self-tolerance and immune homeostasis by sup-
pressing aberrant or excessive immune responses that could 
give rise to autoimmune diseases ( 
1 
). However, their ability 
to dampen the activation of other leukocytes can also pose a 
major barrier to effective antitumor immunity and the sterile 
cure of chronic infections ( 
2 
). The signature forkhead family 
transcription factor FOXP3 anchors the gene expression profi
 le 
that is responsible for the characteristic suppressive function 
of Tregs. Clearly demonstrating the importance of this factor, 
mutations to the gene encoding FOXP3 can lead to fatal auto-
immune disorders in Scurfy mice and in human patients with 
IPEX alike ( 
3, 4 
). Despite the undeniable importance of FOXP3 
for Treg function and immune control, our grasp of the factors 
and mechanisms governing its expression remains incomplete. 
 
The signaling pathways triggered in response to certain 
cytokines (e.g., IL2 and TGFβ) can be critical for induc-
tion and maintenance of FOXP3 expression in Tregs ( 
5 
). 
TGFβ  potently induces FOXP3 expression  
in vitro 
 and  
in vivo
through activation of SMAD signaling molecules, critical 
facilitators and regulators of TGFβ-initiated signaling events 
and downstream gene activation ( 
6, 7 
). TGFβ signaling has 
also been reported to be critical for maintaining FOXP3 
expression and Treg function ( 
8, 9 
). Likewise, SMAD2 and 
SMAD3 are also apparently needed for the optimal pheno-
typic stability of Tregs ( 
10 
). Importantly, mechanisms for the 
augmentation or amplifi
 cation of TGFβ/SMAD signaling in 
Tregs can stabilize or enhance the suppressive function of 
these cells ( 
11 
) and may be crucial determinants of Treg per-
formance in a variety of microenvironmental niches. 
 
YAP is a transcriptional coactivator that developmentally 
regulates organ size ( 
12, 13 
). YAP is frequently elevated in 
a number of cancer types such as lung, colorectal, ovarian, 
liver, and prostate cancers, where it acts as a powerful tumor 
promoter, and its activation is a frequent event in tumor pro-
gression ( 
14 
). The Hippo pathway is believed to be the major 
regulator of YAP nuclear localization, activity, and tumori-
genic potential ( 
15–17 
). However, the physiologic role of YAP 
in the immune system is unknown.

Unexpectedly, we found YAP to be highly expressed by 
Tregs. In this report, we characterize the role of YAP in these 
important cellular mediators of immune control. Our stud-
ies revealed that in the absence of YAP, Tregs failed to sup-
press immune activation in vitro as well as in vivo. We also 
found that YAP potentiates the signaling events triggered by 
dimeric members of the TGFβ cytokine superfamily known 
as activins by activating expression of a key signaling compo-
nent of the activin receptor complex. Interestingly, we found 
that not only is this signaling axis active in Tregs, it could 
also effectively amplify TGFβ/SMAD signaling and the pro-
motion of Treg differentiation and function. Moreover, dis-
rupting this YAP/activin/SMAD axis dramatically slowed the 
growth of tumors in mice, including a highly aggressive mela-
noma model. This experimental treatment also enhanced the 
antitumor efficacy of an antitumor vaccine, suggesting that 
the targeting of this YAP/activin/SMAD axis can be used to 
improve anticancer immunotherapy efficacy.
RESULTS
YAP Expression Is Induced by T Cell–Receptor 
Signaling, Is Highly Expressed by Tregs, and 
Supports Their Function
YAP is a transcriptional coactivator known for its role in 
the Hippo signaling pathway (13). As such, its importance in 
tumorigenesis and organ size determination is well recognized 
(14). However, little is known about the role of the Hippo 
pathway and YAP in immune cells. Reports of cross-talk 
between the Hippo and TGFβ signaling pathways (18, 19) led 
us to speculate that elements of the former may have a role in 
the mechanisms governing immune activation and tolerance.
We therefore screened YAP expression across different sub-
sets of murine CD4+ T cells in order to assess the likelihood 
that Hippo signaling plays a role in these functionally distinct 
T-cell lineages. Little to no Yap mRNA was detected in naïve 
CD4+ T cells, but, notably, YAP expression was uniquely 
induced during the early stages of the in vitro induced (iTreg) 
differentiation. Meanwhile, other T effector subsets (Th0, 
Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells) failed to markedly upregulate Yap 
mRNA (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, transient Yap message accu-
mulation was noted during Th17 skewing. However, 12 hours 
after stimulation, Yap transcript levels returned to baseline 
in these T cells (Fig. 1A; Supplementary Fig. S1A). Impor-
tantly, considerable levels of YAP protein were found in cells 
of the iTreg subset and not other Thelper lineages (Fig. 1B). 
Human Tregs isolated from the peripheral blood of healthy 
donors also displayed higher levels of Yap mRNA than their 
conventional CD4+ (non-Treg) counterparts (Fig. 1C). These 
results implicate YAP as a transcription factor preferentially 
expressed by developing and established Tregs of mice and 
humans.
Because YAP is a major component of the Hippo pathway, 
we assessed levels of several Hippo signaling factors known to 
Figure 1. Expression of YAP mRNA and protein by 
Thelper subsets. Naïve CD4+ T cells (CD4+ CD25−CD62L+) 
were isolated from the spleen and lymph nodes of WT 
C57BL/6 mice and activated under polarizing conditions 
to generate the indicated Thelper subset. The cells 
were harvested at different time points, and mRNA or 
protein levels of YAP were assessed by (A) qRT-PCR 
and (B) western blot. C, Human Tregs (CD3+/CD4+/CD8−/
CD25hi/CD127lo/CD39+) and non-Treg CD4+ T cells were 
obtained from the peripheral blood of healthy donors 
by FACS after Ficoll–Paque PLUS gradient centrifuga-
tion and magnetic bead enrichment of CD4+ T cells. Yap 
mRNA was measured by qRT-PCR. For A and B, shown 
are representative findings from at least 3 independent 
experiments (mean ±SEM of triplicates for A). For C, 
mean expression of Yap mRNA is shown for 10 healthy 
human donor samples. The data were analyzed using the 
Student t test and considered significant if *, P < 0.05; 
**, P < 0.01; ****, P < 0.001.

 YAP Modulates Regulatory T-cell Activity

be upstream of the transcription factor across T-cell  
subsets 
to determine if these are also expressed preferentially by 
Tregs. Interestingly, we found that LATS1/2 and MST1/2, 
unlike YAP, were not upregulated by iTreg-skewing condi-
tions (Supplementary Fig. S1B). These findings suggest that 
unlike other Hippo pathway factors, YAP is uniquely upregu-
lated in developing Tregs, and they imply a role for YAP in the 
biology of these cells outside of its traditional role.
In order to dissect the potential role of YAP in the biology 
of CD4+ T cells, including Tregs, we crossed Yapfl/fl mice to 
CD4-cre transgenic mice to generate animals with a T cell–
specific deletion of Yap. These conditional knockout mice 
(Yap cKO) developed normally without apparent defects in 
T-cell development or peripheral immune cell populations 
(Supplementary Fig. S2). Additionally, no obvious spontane-
ous immune pathologies were noted in these mice. Likewise, 
the lung, kidney, liver, small intestine, and stomach of mice 
with Treg-specific YAP deficiency (generated by crossing Yapfl/fl 
mice to FOXP3Cre+ transgenic mice) appeared comparable to 
wild-type (WT) littermates (Supplementary Fig. S3). We used 
both strains to assess the impact of YAP deficiency on Thelper 
cytokine production and lineage commitment.
To this end, we isolated naïve CD4+ T cells from Yap cKO 
and WT mice for activation under different helper CD4+ T 
cell (Th) polarizing conditions for 72 hours. Yap cKO CD4+ 
T cells express moderately higher levels of IL2 and IFNγ upon 
unbiased activation (Th0 conditions; Fig. 2A). Yap cKO CD4+ 
T cells also express a greater amount of IL17A than WT CD4+ 
T cells under Th17 polarizing conditions (Fig. 2B), and, con-
sistently, Yap cKO CD4+ T cells expressed higher levels of Il17a 
mRNA than WT cells (Fig. 2C). A modest decrease in FOXP3+ 
cells was also seen in Yap cKO-derived T cells cultured under 
Th17 conditions (Fig. 2B). These observations, coupled with 
our earlier discovery that YAP is upregulated in iTregs, led us 
to suspect that YAP positively affects the generation of iTregs 
in vitro over other CD4+ T-cell fates. In line with this, the per-
centages of FOXP3+ cells induced from naïve Yap cKO T cells 
activated under iTreg skewing conditions were modestly, yet 
significantly, lower than those seen in polarized WT CD4+ 
T cells (Supplementary Fig. S4). Naïve CD4+ T cells isolated 
from Yapfl/fl FOXP3Cre+ mice were also consistently less able to 
upregulate FOXP3 than WT controls in response to activation 
and various concentrations of the Treg-promoting cytokine 
TGFβ. Here, YAP deficiency specifically in T cells having already 
“turned on” FOXP3 expression reduced the intensity of signal 
for the Treg transcription factor (Fig. 2D). Taken together, 
these findings suggest that YAP likely plays an important role 
in the initiation or maintenance of Treg differentiation.
In addition to FOXP3 induction, we also hypothesized that 
YAP might contribute to the suppressive function of Tregs as 
well. Indeed, an in vitro suppression assay showed that whereas 
WT Tregs readily dampened the proliferation of naïve T cells, 
Yap cKO Tregs were much less effective suppressors (Fig. 2E). 
In all, these findings implicate YAP as a Treg-associated factor 
with a role in both the generation and function of these cells.
YAP-Deficiency Enhances  
Anti-Melanoma Immunity
Although Tregs are necessary to maintain immune homeo-
stasis, they pose an obstacle in mounting effective antitumor 
immune responses, and their suppressive function dampens 
the efficacy of anticancer immunotherapies (20). For these 
reasons, therapies aimed at inhibiting Treg activity are prom-
ising additions to the cancer immunotherapy arsenal (21). 
We hypothesized that the apparent loss of Treg-suppressive 
function seen in the absence of YAP could enhance antitu-
mor immune responses. To test this, WT and Yap cKO mice 
were challenged with B16 melanoma, an aggressive “nonim-
munogenic” cancer model. Tumor growth was measured in 
these mice over time, and, strikingly, we found that Yap cKO 
mice controlled the subcutaneous growth of the implanted 
melanoma cells whereas tumors grew robustly in WT mice 
(Fig. 3A and B). In line with our in vitro findings, the activa-
tion of CD4+ and CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) 
from Yap cKO mice was apparently much less restrained than 
that of their WT counterparts. Intracellular cytokine stain-
ing revealed these cells produced significantly higher levels 
of IFNγ and TNFα (Fig. 3C) compared with those from WT 
tumors. These results suggest that in the absence of YAP in 
 
T cells, a more robust antitumor immune response is 
mounted.
Tumor challenge of mice with Treg-restricted YAP defi-
ciency yielded similar results. Although WT controls expect-
edly permitted rapid tumor development, Yapfl/fl FOXP3Cre+ 
mice maintained small tumors infiltrated by elevated popula-
tions of inflammatory cytokine-producing leukocytes. Spe-
cifically, producers of the tumoricidal Th1 cytokine IFNγ 
were found at higher frequencies and in greater numbers 
in the tumors of Yapfl/fl FOXP3Cre+ mice than those of WT 
controls (Fig. 3D and E). Analysis of FOXP3 expression by 
CD4+ TILs revealed that deletion of YAP in Tregs reduces the 
frequency of suppressive FOXP3+ Tregs in the tumor micro-
environment (Fig. 3F, left and middle). The relative balance 
(i.e., the ratio) of Tregs and potential effector CD8+ T cells 
was similarly shifted in the tumors of mice with Treg-specific 
YAP deficiency compared with those of WT controls (Fig. 3F, 
right). Treg-specific YAP deficiency also slowed the growth 
of tumors caused by implanted MC38 adenocarcinoma cells 
(Supplementary Fig. S5A–S5B). Not only were MC38 tumors 
much smaller in Yapfl/fl FOXP3Cre+ mice 21 days after injec-
tion, the relative proportions of FOXP3+ Tregs among tumor-
infiltrating T cells were reduced compared with WT tumors. 
In contrast, the frequencies of intratumoral producers of 
IFNγ and TNFα were elevated in the absence of Treg-specific 
YAP expression (Supplementary Fig. S5C–S5D). Corroborat-
ing results were seen in the injectable EL4 thymoma model in 
which Treg-restricted Yap knockout resulted in dramatically 
stunted tumor growth relative to WT mice. As with other 
tumor models, this derailed tumor progression was concur-
rent with reduced Treg proportions and an elevated presence 
of proinflammatory cytokine-producing T cells in the tumor 
microenvironment (Supplementary Fig. S6A–S6D). These 
experiments make a strong case for YAP’s role as both a facili-
tator of Treg presence in the tumor niche and a potent and 
broadly active driver of Treg-enforced inhibition of endog-
enous antitumor immunity.
Some of the most promising immunotherapeutic agents 
(i.e., PD-1 and CTLA4 antagonist antibodies) show even 
greater antitumor effect when administered in concert 
(22–24) or alongside tumor vaccine strategies (25–28). We

therefore tested the therapeutic potential of YAP target-
ing as an immunotherapeutic approach to combat cancer. 
Administration of a known YAP inhibitor, verteporfin (VP; 
ref. 29), to melanoma-bearing mice resulted in modest 
reduction in tumor size (Fig. 3G). Treatment of melanoma-
bearing Yapfl/fl FOXP3Cre+ mice with VP, on the other hand, 
failed to alter the already stunted progression of tumors in 
these mice (Supplementary Fig. S7A), suggesting that poten-
tial off-target effects of this drug or any direct effects on 
tumor cells are not likely contributing to these in vivo obser-
vations. We also tested the effects of combining VP with the 
proven immunotherapeutic agents anti–PD-1 antibody and 
GM-Vac (irradiated GM-CSF–producing B16 cells). Both 
anti–PD-1 and GM-Vac treatments were able to slow tumor 
growth somewhat as monotherapies. Notably, combinato-
rial treatment with VP and anti–PD-1 neutralizing antibody 
suppressed tumor progression to a greater extent than any 
monotherapy tested. Even more dramatic were the synergistic 
effects of VP and GM-Vac, which prevented the development 
of tumors beyond a barely detectable size (Fig. 3G). The 
decidedly improved antitumor efficacy seen upon combina-
tion of either anti–PD-1 or GM-Vac treatment with VP was 
associated with enhanced proportions of IFNγ-producing 
CD8+ and CD4+ T cells and a compromised Treg presence in 
the tumor microenvironment (Fig. 3H; Supplementary Fig. 
S7B–S7E). These findings strongly suggest a major role for 
Treg-derived YAP in crafting the immunosuppressive nature 
of the tumor microenvironment. They also suggest the 
potential of immunotherapeutic approaches that include 
YAP-targeting agents.
YAP Potentiates Expression of Genes Involved  
in TGFa/SMAD and Activin Signaling
To gain insight into the mechanism by which YAP contrib-
utes to Tregs and their enforcement of immune suppression, 
we isolated Tregs from mice lacking YAP in these cells (Yap 
cKO) and subjected them to RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) 
analysis along with WT Tregs and naïve CD4+ T cells from 
both mice. The results of this analysis revealed that YAP-
deficient Tregs display reduced expression of several genes 
known to be important in the signaling pathway triggered by 
the anti-inflammatory cytokine TGFβ. Interestingly, one of 
the genes most downregulated in the absence of YAP was that 
encoding the signaling component of the activin receptor 
complex known as Acvr1c (Fig. 4A; Supplementary Fig. S8A). 
Confirming a role for YAP in potentiating Acvr1c expres-
sion, we found that WT CD4+ T cells display considerable 
upregulation of the transcript for this receptor subunit dur-
ing in vitro Treg differentiation, whereas their YAP-deficient 
counterparts did not. Interestingly, freshly isolated nTregs 
expressed modest levels of Acvr1c. However, upon activation, 
these Tregs dramatically activated activin receptor expres-
sion in a YAP-dependent manner (Supplementary Fig. S8B). 
Indeed, neither nTreg nor differentiating iTregs from Yapfl/fl 
FOXP3Cre+ mice expressed considerable Acvr1c mRNA levels. 
Thus YAP-mediated activin responsiveness may have consid-
erable influence over the biology of multiple Treg popula-
tions.
It has been suggested that activin can promote TGFβ 
signaling. Pathway analysis of our RNA-seq results showed 
that the gene expression patterns most affected by YAP 
deficiency in Tregs were highly relevant to immune control 
and the diverse autoimmune pathologies resulting from the 
breakdown of such control. Among these, the genes associ-
ated with the TGFβ signaling cascade were markedly altered 
(Supplementary Fig. S8C). Furthermore, RT-PCR analysis 
also showed reduced transcript levels for several known 
TGFβ-responsive genes in Tregs from YAPfl/fl FOXP3Cre+ 
mice (Supplementary Fig. S8D). In light of these find-
ings, we suspected that YAP contributes to Treg-mediated 
immune control at least in part by bolstering TGFβ/SMAD 
signaling through the activin/AcVR1C axis in these sup-
pressor cells.
Although activin mRNA levels were low in naïve CD4+ T 
cells, in vitro differentiating Tregs (naïve CD4+ T cells acti-
vated with anti-CD3/CD28 in the presence of IL2 and TGFβ) 
upregulated activin expression over time (Supplementary 
Fig. S9A). The kinetics of this upregulation paralleled the 
appearance of FOXP3 expression in these cells (Supplemen-
tary Fig. S9B). qRT-PCR analysis also showed that expression 
of the activin receptor (AcVR1C) was similarly low in naïve 
CD4+ T cells, but was robustly upregulated under in vitro 
culture conditions that generate iTreg (Supplementary Figs. 
S8B and S9C). We went on to dissect which Treg-inducing 
stimuli were chiefly responsible for inducing expression of 
YAP and elements of activin/ACVR1C signaling. To this end, 
naïve CD4+ T cells were activated in vitro with anti-CD3/
CD28 antibodies, either alone or in the presence of IL2, 
TGFβ, or IL2 and TGFβ. As expected, activation alone failed 
to induce upregulation of these genes or the canonical Treg 
transcription factor FOXP3. The cytokine TGFβ did trigger 
significant expression of FOXP3, as expected, but YAP as well. 
Exposure to IL2 along with TGFβ (but not IL2 alone) greatly 
augmented expression of YAP and FOXP3. Of the conditions 
tested, those upregulating robust YAP also brought about 
expression of activin and ACVR1C (Supplementary Fig. S9D–
S9G). These findings further align the upregulation of YAP 
expression and activin signaling with the Treg lineage and 
shed some light on the largely unknown cast of molecular 
characters regulating these processes in T cells.
To gain further insight into the mechanism of YAP-
mediated ACVR1C upregulation, we explored the potential 
involvement of a known YAP-collaborating factor. Mature 
YAP protein is known to contain a TEAD-binding domain, 
and prior studies (largely conducted in non-T cells) have 
identified numerous target genes controlled by the coop-
eration of these factors. Suggesting that transcription at the 
AcVR1c locus is activated through YAP–TEAD interaction, 
the promoter sequence of this gene was found to contain 
two TEAD consensus binding sites (Fig. 5A). To test the 
importance of TEAD binding for YAP-dependent AcVR1c 
expression, we prepared luciferase-based reporter constructs 
under the control of WT murine AcVR1c promoter sequence. 
Mutant constructs having either or both of the TEAD sites 
ablated were also designed (Fig. 5B). Each AcVR1c-luciferase 
reporter construct was delivered into Jurkat T cells along with 
an expression vector encoding YAP (“YAP1WT”) or a mutant 
version of this transcription factor unable to interact with 
TEAD (“YAP1mut”) owing to an S-to-A mutation at residue 
94 (“S94A”). In this system, expression of TEAD1 or YAP1WT

alone induced only modest activation of AcVR1c expression. 
In contrast, robust luciferase signal was detected when WT 
YAP and TEAD were coexpressed. Mutation of YAP’s TEAD 
interaction site, however, resulted in far less reporter activity 
(Fig. 5C), supporting the notion that YAP–TEAD coopera-
tion is necessary for optimal AcVR1c expression. Similarly, 
loss of a single TEAD binding site in the promoter sequence 
reduced YAP-induced transcription whereas mutation of 
both sites resulted in a significant and near-complete loss 
of reporter signal (Fig. 5D). These results clearly implicate 
a molecular partnership between YAP and TEAD in the 
potentiation of activin signaling through AcVR1c expression. 
This point was further supported by chromatin immunopre-
cipitation (ChIP) assays showing both YAP1 and TEAD1 are 
enriched at the AcVR1c locus in WT iTregs (Fig. 5E). Notably, 
in Yap cKO-derived iTregs, TEAD1 was still found interact-
ing with the AcVR1c locus despite the absence of YAP (Fig. 
5E). These findings illuminate the mechanism behind YAP’s 
activation of activin signaling.
Activin Enhances SMAD/TGFa Signaling  
and Treg Differentiation
Because activin has been reported to promote SMAD sign-
aling in non-T cells (30), we tested whether activin signaling 
in T cells could have a similar effect. SMAD activity was 
assessed by western blot analysis of SMAD phosphorylation. 
Indeed, we found that whereas untreated CD4+ T cells did not 
contain discernible levels of active (phosphorylated) SMAD 
molecules, treatment with 5 or 10 ng/mL of activin A resulted 
in elevation of phospho-SMAD levels. As expected, TGFβ 
treatment (0.5 or 2 ng/mL) also induced SMAD phospho-
rylation. Importantly, combined activin and TGFβ treatment 
resulted in even further activation of the SMAD signaling 
pathway (Fig. 6A). These findings suggest that activin signal-
ing can augment signaling along the TGFβ/SMAD axis—a 
signaling pathway crucial for multiple aspects of Treg biology 
and immune tolerance (7).
TGFβ/SMAD-mediated events are important during the 
upregulation of FOXP3 and the generation of Tregs from 
naïve CD4+ T-cell precursors. We next investigated whether 
YAP-dependent activin signaling can participate in the driv-
ing of this process. Having shown that YAP plays an impor-
tant role in promoting or maintaining FOXP3 expression 
induced in the presence of various TGFβ concentrations 
(Fig. 2D), and having implicated the transcription factor in 
the regulation of TGFβ-sensitive genes (Fig. 4; Supplemen-
tary Fig. S8), we therefore postulated that YAP-mediated 
upregulation of AcVR1C and SMAD signaling might provide 
a crucial amplification of this important Treg-supporting 
signaling pathway that allows for more robust or sustained 
FOXP3 expression.
To explore the involvement of activin/AcVR1C signaling 
in the enhancement of Treg differentiation by YAP, the effect 
of supplemental activin A on in vitro Treg commitment was 
also investigated. As expected, activation of naïve CD4+ T 
cells without TGFβ yielded little to no FOXP3 induction 
regardless of YAP expression. Strikingly, activation of WT 
cells with exogenous activin A, even in the absence of TGFβ, 
generated a population of FOXP3+ cells. Although a subopti-
mal concentration of TGFβ resulted in modest upregulation 
of FOXP3 (mirroring the effects on SMAD activation), com-
bined treatment of WT naïve CD4+ T cells with low doses 
of TGFβ plus activin A resulted in synergistic promotion of 
FOXP3+ T-cell induction. This induction of Tregs by activin 
A treatment alone was largely not seen upon FOXP3-driven 
knockout of Yap, and although dual treatment of differenti-
ating Yapfl/fl FOXP3Cre+ iTregs did enhance the generation 
of FOXP3+ cells, it was to an extent far less than that seen 
in their WT counterparts (Fig. 6B). These results suggest 
that activin signaling via YAP-dependent AcVR1C expres-
sion on Treg not only augments TGFβ signaling but can also 
drive the process of FOXP3 upregulation. Supporting this 
notion, naïve T cells lacking AcVR1c were found to be less 
sensitive to TGFβ-induced iTreg differentiation than their 
WT counterparts, particularly when TGFβ concentrations 
were low (Supplementary Fig. S10A–S10B). Interestingly, 
exogenous activin supplementation could do little to rescue 
the deficient FOXP3 induction seen in naïve CD4+ T cells 
lacking either SMAD2 or SMAD3, or, for that matter, the 
pronounced defect in iTreg generation seen in T cells geneti-
cally lacking both SMAD molecules (Supplementary Fig. 
S11). This observation confirms that functional SMAD sig-
naling is required for activin-mediated enhancement of Treg 
generation, in agreement with prior studies (31). In all, these 
findings are very much in line with a role for YAP-driven 
activin signaling in the augmentation of signaling down the 
SMAD/TGFβ axis in T cells.
Activin-Mediated Support of Treg Function  
Is YAP/AcVR1C Dependent
YAP deficiency leads to improved antitumor immunity 
and a Treg pool that is insensitive to an activator of the 
TGFβ/SMAD signaling pathway (i.e., activin). We therefore 
hypothesized that YAP facilitates robust Treg function in vivo 
through the induction of AcVR1C, which in turn amplifies the 
pro-Treg signaling cascade. In order to determine if the Treg-
promoting effects of YAP were due to the upregulation of 
AcVR1C, we set out to test whether the defective Treg function 
seen in Yap knockouts could be restored by ectopic expression 
of AcVR1C. In an in vitro suppression assay, as expected, Yapfl/fl
 
FOXP3Cre+-derived Tregs transduced with an empty vector 
control expressed reduced levels of ACVR1C protein and were 
much less efficient suppressors of naïve CD4+ T-cell prolifera-
tion than their WT counterparts. However, lentiviral-based 
delivery of an ACVR1C-encoding expression construct into 
Yapfl/fl FOXP3Cre+-derived Tregs more than rescued receptor 
expression, which greatly enhanced their suppressive potency 
beyond even that of WT Tregs (Fig. 6C). These results sup-
port the conclusion that activin signaling through AcVR1C 
(upregulated by YAP) can amplify the suppressive potency 
of established Tregs as well as the TGFβ-driven differentia-
tion of iTregs and potentially other facets of this cytokine’s 
broadly immunosuppressive action. Importantly, they also 
suggest that targeting either YAP or activin signaling is likely 
to undermine the tolerance-promoting attributes of TGFβ 
and both subsets of FOXP3+ Tregs in the cancer setting. 
These approaches may provide avenues to enhance antitu-
mor immunity either as novel treatments on their own or as

tional capacity of these cells was assessed in vitro. The transduced Tregs were cocultured with CFSE-stained CD45.1+ naïve CD4+ T cells (responders) at 
the indicated ratio and antigen-presenting cells (T cell–depleted splenocytes). After 5 days of activation, responder cell proliferation was assessed by flow 
cytometry. Shown at left are representative plots of responder cell gated (CD45.1+/CD4+) events from 1 of 2 independent experiments with like results. 
The immunoblot at right confirms expression levels of AcVR1c in transduced Tregs, and the bar graph (lower right) depicts the mean fraction of proliferat-

Activin Blockade or AcVR1c Knockout Inhibits 
Tumor Growth
As an instigator of an apparent feed-forward loop capable 
of amplifying TGFβ/SMAD activity, YAP presents a tempt-
ing target for those aiming to break tolerance in the cancer 
 
setting. However, the targeting of YAP in patients with cancer 
may prove problematic owing to the molecule’s intracellular 
location and the chemical drawbacks of known inhibitors 
(e.g., VP has noted solubility issues; ref. 29). Therefore, the 
activin/AcVR1C interaction is likely to serve as a desirable 
alternative strategy. Having demonstrated the positive effects 
of activin signaling on the TGFβ/SMAD signaling pathway 
and the processes of Treg generation and function, which can 
oppose immune-mediated tumor cell killing, we suspected 
that disrupting activin function should enhance antitumor 
immunity. We therefore tested the potential of activin tar-
geting as an immunotherapeutic approach to combat can-
cer. Administration of anti-activin monoclonal antibody to 
mice injected subcutaneously with B16 melanoma markedly 
stunted the development of tumors relative to an inert iso-
type control (Fig. 7A). We also tested the value of combining 
anti-activin blocking antibody treatment with the anticancer 
vaccine GM-Vac. Treatment with GM-Vac alone was able to 
partially slow the growth of tumors to an extent similar to 
anti-activin monotherapy. However, combining anti-activin 
treatment with GM-Vac was able to arrest tumor growth 
at a barely detectable size (Fig. 7A). Anti-activin treatment 
also successfully reduced the frequency of FOXP3+ Tregs 
among TILs, and although GM-Vac–receiving mice displayed 
some reduced Treg presence in their tumors, combined GM-
Vac and activin blockade resulted in dramatic loss of these 
suppressor T cells from the tumor microenvironment (Fig. 
7B). The effect of blocking activin on Tregs coincided with 
increased frequencies of IFNγ-producing CD8+ and CD4+  
T cells, an observation even more prominent upon combina-
tion of GM-Vac and anti-activin treatments (Fig. 7C). These 
results demonstrate the susceptibility of the YAP/AcVR1c/
activin axis to therapeutic targeting at multiple points.
Along this line, B16 tumor growth was also markedly slower 
in AcVR1c knockout mice than in WT controls (Fig. 7D). Cor-
respondingly, the TILs from AcVR1c-deficient mice contained 
fewer FOXP3+ Tregs than their WT counterparts and displayed 
a selective elevation of IFNγ-producing T cells (Fig. 7E and F). 
 
As with chemical YAP inhibition and antibody-mediated 
activin blockade, administering GM-Vac to AcVR1c knockout 
mice enhanced the already considerable antitumor effect of 
genetic AcVR1c ablation (Supplementary Fig. S12). From 
these results, it is clear that disrupting any of the several ele-
ments of the YAP/activin/SMAD axis can undermine immune 
suppression and oppose tumor progression in mice.
In all, our findings support the conclusion that signaling 
along the YAP-regulated activin/ACVR1C axis can support 
Treg generation and function and potentially other broadly 
immune-suppressing effects of the TGFβ/SMAD pathway. 
Importantly, they also suggest that targeting this axis is 
likely to undermine the immune suppressive attributes of 
TGFβ and FOXP3+ Tregs in the cancer setting—either alone 
or in combination with other promising immunotherapeutic 
agents (e.g., immune checkpoint–blocking antibodies and 
anticancer vaccines).
DISCUSSION
Tregs are indispensable for restraining potentially lethal 
self-directed (autoimmune) responses or overexuberant ones 
mounted against normally harmless commensal microbes 
(inflammatory bowel disease; ref. 1). However, in patients 
with cancer, Tregs can be greatly enriched within tumors, 
sometimes systemically (32). The suppressive function of 
these cells in this setting dampens the effectiveness of tumor-
directed immunity and is a major obstacle for developing 
effective anticancer immunotherapies (21).
As part of an ongoing effort to identify precise mechanisms 
of Treg generation, maintenance, and function in the context 
of cancer, we have made the surprising discovery that YAP, a 
transcription factor critical in developmental regulation of 
organ size, is in fact an important factor in the generation 
and function of Tregs. Deletion of Yap1 in T cells some-
what enhances both Th1 and Th17 development but most 
impressively diminishes generation of iTregs under condi-
tions of limited TGFβ. YAP deficiency also negatively affects 
the suppressive function of Tregs. The inability of Tregs to 
suppress immunity in vivo in the absence of YAP was dramati-
cally illustrated by our B16 melanoma tumor model experi-
ments (Fig. 3). The poorly immunogenic tumor failed to 
grow in mice with Treg-specific Yap deletion, which displayed 
markedly enhanced indicators of proinflammatory antitu-
mor immunity compared with WT controls. This improved 
deployment of antitumor immunity was seen alongside a 
markedly diminished Treg presence in the tumor microenvi-
ronment (Fig. 3E and F)—observations also seen upon Treg-
specific YAP deficiency across other, distinct tumor models as 
well. These findings strongly suggest that YAP is important 
for the accumulation and suppressive function of Tregs in the 
tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, they imply that tar-
geting YAP should be a potent means of overcoming immune 
suppression in the cancer setting and improving the efficacy 
of endogenous and therapeutically induced tumor killing 
by leukocyte. Further characterization of YAP expression by 
Treg subsets found in different healthy and diseased tissues 
(including tumors) should more clearly define this factor’s 
role in immune control in specific physiologic contexts.
Here, we present a body of data strongly suggesting a 
Treg-specific role for YAP in promoting the immune sup-
pression capable of allowing the persistence and progression 
of tumors in the cancer setting. Indeed, YAP-expression pat-
terns and the dramatically stunted tumor growth seen in 
Yapfl/fl FOXP3Cre+ mice support this. However, comparing 
the degree of antitumor effect resulting from T cell– and 
Treg-driven YAP deficiency, it appears that a slightly more 
dramatic effect is seen in the former case. Although the bulk 
of the effect seen in Fig. 3A is phenocopied by the more 
restrictive deletion of YAP in only FOXP3+ cells (Fig. 3D), it 
is possible that YAP may play a tumor-abetting role in some 
other T-cell population capable of inducing the factor in 
the cancer setting. Although such YAP expression appears 
to have relatively minor consequences next to Treg-derived 
Research.

 YAP Modulates Regulatory T-cell Activity
RESEARCH ARTICLE
 
August  2018 CANCER DISCOVERY | 1039 
YAP, at least in the tumor models used in our study, future 
work may bring to light additional layers of YAP’s protumor 
effects involving cells beyond FOXP3+ Tregs (such as aner-
gized or exhausted T cells, non–FOXP3-expressing TR1 Tregs, 
etc.). These too may be susceptible to YAP-targeting strate-
gies, which, based on our results, clearly should have potent 
antitumor effects.
Indeed, using a known YAP antagonist with modest inhibi-
tory activity (29), we confirmed the potential of YAP as a target 
for Treg-undermining immunotherapies. Although  
inhibiting 
YAP alone slightly decreased tumor growth, we observed 
strong synergy in antitumor activity and immunity-boosting 
effects when the drug was combined with a tumor vaccine 
and checkpoint inhibitor treatment that alone possess much 
less potent effects. These findings suggest that YAP-targeting 
approaches should increase the efficacy of current immuno-
therapies, potentially by enhancing the presence of activated 
effector leukocytes in the tumor microenvironment.
Analysis of the downstream targets of YAP activity in 
Treg identified ACVR1C led to the finding that the activin–
activin receptor signaling axis plays a major role in the 
augmentation of TGFβ/SMAD signaling and Treg gen-
eration and function (summarized in Supplementary Fig. 
S13). This pathway is highly important for the induction of 
extrathymic FOXP3+ T cells from naïve CD4+ precursors, as 
SMADs bind critical enhancer regions for the FOXP3 gene 
(6, 33). It is also important for sustaining FOXP3 expres-
sion and suppressive function in Tregs (7), and TGFβ has 
been implicated as a promoter of survival and phenotypic 
stabilization of thymic Tregs (34, 35). With such reliance on 
TGFβ and SMAD signaling, it stands to reason that Tregs 
use mechanisms to optimize or amplify the downstream 
signaling events and resultant gene regulation triggered 
by this pathway. Such amplification mechanisms can be 
important for maintaining the gene expression and phe-
notype traits underlying the suppressive function of Tregs. 
Documented examples include the enzymatic conversion 
of latent TGFβ to its active form (36) and the triggering of 
SMAD activation by galectin and CD44 (11). The upregula-
tion of YAP and subsequently ACVR1C—the receptor for 
a known enhancer of SMAD signaling (i.e., activin)—may 
serve as an additional mechanism for amplifying this decid-
edly pro-Treg cascade. Herein activin/ACVR1C signaling 
can enhance the downstream signaling events triggered by 
TGFβ. Reports of activin expression in several tumor types 
(37, 38) support the notion that tumor-accumulating Tregs 
benefit particularly from activin/ACVR1C signaling facili-
tated by YAP induction.
Our proof-of-concept experiments demonstrate that this 
pro-Treg amplification mechanism is susceptible to thera-
peutic disruption. Particularly, our findings suggest that 
antibody-mediated activin blockade may prove a most effec-
tive means for the disruption of Treg- and tumor-abetting 
TGFβ activation in patients with cancer. Additionally, the 
development and vetting of therapeutic antibodies capable of 
neutralizing activin, AcVR1C, or blocking its association with 
AcVR1C in patients with cancer may lead to new and potent 
immunotherapeutic regimens capable of releasing antitumor 
immunity from stifling Treg-enforced tolerance. On the other 
hand, our findings suggest that supplementation of activin 
or other therapeutic enhancements of the activin/ACVR1C 
axis could have considerable potential as a strategy to correct 
inadequate immune regulation in settings of autoimmunity 
(e.g., multiple sclerosis) or inflammatory disease (e.g., inflam-
matory bowel disease). Future application of YAP inhibitors 
or activin/ACVR1C ablation in mouse models relevant to 
these and other pathologies of immune dysregulation will 
shed light on whether this pro-Treg loop is generally impor-
tant for immune control or if it is principally operative in the 
tumor setting.
Our findings are, to our knowledge, the first to implicate 
YAP as a transcriptional facilitator of Treg differentiation and 
function. Although this molecule has been previously studied 
for its regulation of development, organ size, regeneration, 
and tumorigenesis (39), and its role as a transcriptional effec-
tor of gene expression downstream of the Hippo pathway is 
well established, the importance of the Hippo pathway and 
its associated cofactors in Tregs and immune control is only 
beginning to be understood. A recent study showed that the 
Hippo pathway kinase known as MST1 plays an important 
role in stabilizing FOXP3 protein levels and supporting Treg 
function (40). Our present findings reveal that YAP potenti-
ates Treg-supporting SMAD activity in T cells through activin 
signaling. Notably, though, this unexpected role appears to 
be independent of other Hippo factors (i.e., MST1/2 and 
LATS1/2), as these, unlike YAP, were not highly upregulated 
in developing Tregs. Interestingly, another Hippo effector 
known as TAZ (regarded to be a YAP paralog) was recently 
identified as a promoter of Th17 differentiation in naïve 
CD4+ T cells and a negative regulator of FOXP3 function 
and expression in these cells (41). This role for TAZ in the 
generation of proinflammatory T cells was also apparently 
Figure 7.  Activin blockade and AcVR1c deficiency slows B16 tumor growth and enhances the antitumor immune response. A, B16 melanoma cells 
were injected into individual female C57BL/6 mice (8–12 weeks of age). Tumor-bearing mice were randomly assigned into treatment groups once tumors 
were palpable ∼7 days after injection. Anti-activin A antibodies (R&D Systems) were administered (100 μg/mouse/injection) intraperitoneally twice a 
week once to one group. Another group received like doses of control IgG1. Other cohorts of tumor-bearing mice received GM-vaccine [100 μL of 1 × 106 
lethally irradiated (150 Gy) B16 GM-vaccine cells or combined anti-activin/GM-vaccine treatment; n = 10 mice per group]. B, Treg frequencies among the

producing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells recovered from tumor cell suspensions were similarly assessed. D, The right flank of 8-week WT and AcVR1c KO female 
mice (C57BL/6 background; n = 8/group) were injected with 4 × 105 B16 cells in 100 μL PBS. E, The proportions of IFNγ- and TNFα-expressing T cells

tive flow plots from a single mouse from each group are depicted (left) alongside the mean cell frequencies across 3 independent experiments (right). All

beyond its  
traditional Hippo-dependent role. Taken together, 
these newly uncovered immunologic roles played by YAP and 
TAZ suggest that different molecular players in the Hippo 
pathway can have functionally opposite and mechanistically 
distinct roles in determining the balance between inflamma-
tion and tolerance. Further dissection of this pathway in T 
cells should add considerably to our understanding of this 
balance and, based on our current study’s findings, may lead 
to potent new immunotherapy approaches.
METHODS
Mice
C57/BL6 Yapfl/fl mice were generous gifts of Dr. Duojia Pan. 
C57/BL6 AcVR1c knockout mice were gifts from Dr. Ning Lu. C57/
BL6 CD4-cre and FOXP3-YFP-Cre transgenic mice were purchased 
from The Jackson Laboratory. Smad2−/−, Smad3−/−, and Smad2/3 
double knockout mice on a C57BL/6 background were originally 
obtained from Dr. Se-Jin Lee’s laboratory and were previously 
described (42). All animal experiments performed were approved 
by the Johns Hopkins University Institutional Animal Care and 
Use Committee.
In Vitro T-cell Differentiation
Naïve CD4+ T cells (CD4+ CD25− CD62Lhi) were sorted on a 
FACSAria II high-speed sorter. The sorted cells were activated with 
plate-bound anti-CD3 (1 μg/mL) and soluble anti-CD28 (2 or 
 
4 μg/mL) in a 24-well plate with the following polarizing conditions: 
Th1 [IL12 (10 ng/mL), anti-IL4 (10 μg/mL)], Th2 [IL4 (10 ng/mL), 
anti-IFNγ (10 μg/mL), anti-IL12 (10 μg/mL)], Th17 [IL6 (10 ng/mL), 
 
TGFβ1 (1.25 ng/mL), IL23 (10 ng/mL), IL1β (10 ng/mL), anti-IFNγ 
(10 μg/mL), anti-IL4 (10 μg/mL)], Treg [TGFβ1 (5 ng/mL, or as indi-
cated), IL2 (100 IU/mL)] typically for 4 days, unless otherwise indicated.
Human T-cell Isolation from Peripheral Blood
Deidentified human peripheral blood was obtained from blood 
bank in strict accordance with the Johns Hopkins University School 
of Medicine’s Institutional Review Board guidelines. Samples were 
obtained from a total of 10 healthy adult volunteers (age range, 30–46 
years). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were extracted from whole 
blood through a gradient of Ficoll–Paque PLUS (GE Healthcare). CD4+ 
T cells were enriched using a Dynabeads Untouched CD4 T-cell isola-
tion kit (Invitrogen). Tregs were identified and flow sorted via the fol-
lowing staining profile: CD3+/CD4+/CD8−/CD25hi/CD127lo/CD39+. 
Non-Treg CD4+ T cells were sorted as previously described (43).
In Vitro Suppression Assay
WT naïve CD4+ T cells (0.1 × 106) were labeled with carboxyfluo-
rescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE) and cultured in a 96-well 
bottom plate with anti-CD3/CD28-conjugated beads at a cell-to-
bead ratio of 1:1. Serially diluted Tregs (CD4+ CD25hi) were cocul-
tured for 72 hours, and cellular proliferation by CFSE was measured 
by flow cytometry.
Lentivirus Production and Transduction
HEK293T cells were purchased from the ATCC in 2015 and were kept 
as a frozen stock. This cell line has not been authenticated by the labo-
ratory. Recombinant lentiviruses were generated using a three-plasmid 
system as described previously (44). The AcVR1c cDNA was cloned into 
the modified pLV lentiviral vector carrying cytomegalovirus-driven 
Thy1.1 as a transduction efficiency marker. Virus was harvested at 48 
and 72 hours after transfection, and titer was determined based on 
percentages of Thy1.1-positive Jurkat T cells after transduction with 
serially diluted viral supernatant. The titer, calculated as transducing 
units (TU)/mL of supernatant, was from 2 × 106 to 8 × 106 TU/mL. 
 
The virus-containing supernatant was concentrated using an Amicon 
Ultra Concentrator (Millipore) and stored at −80°C. Gene transduc-
tion into CD4+CD25− conventional T cells and CD4+CD25+ Tregs 
was performed by stimulating cells with plate-bound anti-CD3 
 
(10 μg/mL) and soluble anti-CD28 (1 μg/mL) with 60 U/mL human 
recombinant IL2 for 16 hours. Activated T cells were transduced with 
viral supernatants supplemented with 60 U/mL IL2 and 8 μg mL-1 
polybrene, followed by centrifugation for 1 hour at 2,500 rpm. After 
transduction, 20 U/mL human recombinant IL2 (eBioscience) was 
added to the culture. At 40 hours after transduction, Thy1.1+ Tregs 
were sorted for western blot and/or suppression assay as indicated.
RNA-seq Analysis
Spleen and peripheral lymph nodes were harvested from YapWT/WT; 
CD4-Cre-WT and Yap flox/flox (fl/fl); CD4-Cre+ mice (n = 5/
group). CD4+ T cells were magnetically enriched, and naïve (CD4+ 
CD62L+ CD25−) T cells and natural Tregs (nTregs, CD4+ CD62L+/− 
CD25hi) were flow sorted from each group. For activation con-
dition, sorted nTregs were further activated with 2 μg/mL of 
plate-coated αCD3 and 2 μg/mL of soluble αCD28 with TGFβ1 
(5 ng/mL) and IL2 (100 U/mL) for 24 hours. nTregs (2 × 106; no 
stimulation or stimulation) from WT and Yap cKO mice were har-
vested and washed with 1× PBS twice and immediately snap-frozen 
until further RNA-seq analysis.
Construction of RNA-seq Libraries
Total RNA was isolated by TRIzol from naïve CD4+ T cells or 
natural Tregs with or without the stimulation anti-CD3/CD28 for 
48 hours from WT or Yap cKO mice. RNA quality was monitored on 
Bioanalyzer. Strand-specific RNA-seq libraries were prepared using 
the TruSeq Stranded Total RNA LT Sample Prep Kit (with Ribo-
Zero Gold, RS-122-2301, Illumina) from 322 ng of total RNA by fol-
lowing the manufacturer’s protocols. Briefly, rRNAs were depleted 
using biotinylated, target-specific oligos combined with Ribo-Zero 
rRNA removal beads. After purification, RNA was fragmented using 
divalent cations under elevated temperature, and transcribed into 
first-strand cDNA using reverse transcriptase and random primers, 
followed by second-strand cDNA synthesis using DNA Polymerase 
I and RNase H. A single “A” base was added to these cDNA frag-
ments that were subsequently ligated with the adapter. The products 
were enriched with 12-cycle PCR. The concentration of final cDNA 
libraries in 30 μL ddH2O reached 24 to 27 ng/μL as determined on 
Qubit 2.0.
Analysis of RNA-seq Data
Sequencing was performed on Illumina HiSeq2000 at Beijing 
Genomics Institute with the type of paired-end, 100 bp. Data quality was 
assessed by FastQC software (http://www.bioinformatics.babraham. 
ac.uk/projects/fastqc/). Mapping to a mouse reference genome 
(mm10) was conducted by TopHat. Differentially expressed genes 
were called by Cuffdiff (45). The genes with P value < 0.05 and abso-
lute values of log2-transformed fold changes larger than 1.5 between 
WT and Yap cKO T cells were considered differentially expressed. A 
heat map was generated in R statistical software using the geom_tile 
function under ggplot2 package. Clustering was done with the com-
plete linkage and Euclidean distance using the hclust function in R 
statistical software. Pathway analysis (Ingenuity) was carried out as 
described previously (46).

For extracellular staining, harvested cells were washed and incu-
bated in PBS containing 1% FBS containing the below fluorochrome-

conjugated antibodies in a U-bottom 96-well plate. For intracellular 
cytokine staining, harvested cells were restimulated in PMA and 
ionomycin in the presence of Golgi-Plug (BD Biosciences). After 
5-hour incubation, the cells were fixed/permeabilized (eBioscience) 
and incubated with antibodies (see Supplementary Table S1A for 
a comprehensive list). For cellular proliferation, cell Trace CFSE 
cell proliferation kit (Invitrogen) was used per the manufacturer’s 
manual.
Quantitative Real-Time PCR
RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen) followed by cDNA 
synthesis reaction using SuperScript III (Invitrogen) in a 20 μL 
reaction/well. The same amount of RNA was used in each cDNA 
synthesis reaction measured by NanoDrop Spectrophotometer 
(ThermoScientific). The same volume of cDNA per sample was pre-
pared for real-time PCR analysis using SYBR Green (Pierce) and the 
indicated primers to assess transcript levels of each gene.
Tumor Growth Experiments
Murine B16 melanoma, MC38 colon cancer, and EL4 thymoma 
cell lines were purchased from the ATCC and kept as frozen stock 
in 2015. These cell lines have not been authenticated by the labora-
tory. Cells were cultured in vitro in DMEM plus 10% heat-inactivated 
FBS and were detached by trypsinization and washed prior to s.c. 
injection into the shaved side flank of the indicated strains of female 
mice between the ages of 6 and 8 weeks on a C57BL/6 background 
 
(1 × 105 cells). In some experiments, 1 × 104  to 5 × 104 B16 melanoma 
cells were injected into each mouse in the footpad. Where indicated, 
once tumors were palpable (7–10 days after injection), 100 mL of 
 
1 × 106 lethally irradiated (150 Gy) B16 GM-vaccine cells (GM-VAX) 
were injected s.c. into the contralateral limb. A hybridoma cell line 
expressing a blocking anti–PD-1 antibody (clone G4) was obtained 
from Dr. Charles Drake. One hundred microgram/mouse/injection 
of anti–PD-1 (G4) was injected intraperitoneally twice a week once 
tumors were palpable (7–10 days) in conjunction with vaccine and 
verteporfin (USP, USP-1711461) treatments. Verteporfin was dosed 
at 2 mg/mouse diluted to 200 μL with PBS and injected intraperi-
toneally every two days. Activin neutralization antibodies and iso-
type control IgG were purchased from R&D Systems. One hundred 
microgram/mouse/injection of activin-neutralizing antibodies was 
given intraperitoneally twice a week. For all these experiments, 5 to 
10 mice were used per group. Tumor progression was assessed by 
measuring changes in tumor length (L) and width (W) and tumor 
volume (V) over time. Tumor volume was calculated using the for-
mula (L × W2)/2.
Molecular Cloning and Site-Directed Mutagenesis
Mouse AcVR1c promoter (1.2 kb) was cloned from the genomic 
DNA of isolated CD4+ T cells, and the sequence was confirmed. The 
amplified clones were ligated to SacI/XhoI-digested pGL4.1-Basic 
Vector (Promega) using the In-Fusion Cloning Kit (Clontech). Site-
directed mutagenesis was carried out using the QuikChange Light-
ning Kit (Agilent Technologies).
Transient Transfection and Luciferase Assay
Jurkat T cells (clone E6-1) were purchased from the ATCC in 
2016 and were kept as a frozen stock. This cell line has not been 
authenticated by the laboratory. Jurkat T cells (1.5 × 107) were 
transfected with 5 μg pGL4.1-AcVR1c, 1 μg of pRL-TK Vector 
(Promega), and other indicated plasmids by electroporation using 
Nucleofector II (Amaxa/Lonza). The cells were rested overnight 
and stimulated with mock or PMA/ionomycin for 8 hours before 
being harvested and lysed followed by luminescence measurement 
using a Dual-Luciferase Assay (Promega) as per the manufacturer’s 
instructions.
ChIP Assay
ChIP assay was performed according to the manufacturer’s guid-
ance (Invitrogen MAGnify ChIP system). Briefly, sorted CD4+ iTregs 
were activated with αCD3/αCD28–conjugated beads overnight and 
fixed with 2% formaldehyde. Sonicated DNA was immunoprecipi-
tated with anti-YAP1 (Cell Signaling Technology), and anti-TEAD1 
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The immunoprecipitated chromatin 
was analyzed on Roche LightCycler 480 by SYBR Green using the 
following primers for AcVR1c promoter: 5′-CATTGACGTCTCTATG 
GAAG-3′ (forward), 5′-CAAGCACCATTGCCTTCAGAC-3′ (reverse).
Statistical Analyses
Values are presented as means ± SEM where appropriate. Statisti-
cal differences among multiple groups were determined using a two-
way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a Newmane–Keuls multiple 
comparison test, unless otherwise indicated. Unpaired, two-tailed 
Student t tests were used for single comparisons. In general, P values 
<0.05 were considered statistically significant and are indicated as 
follows: *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.002; ****, P < 0.001; ns, 
not significant. GraphPad Prism 7 was used to calculate P values.
