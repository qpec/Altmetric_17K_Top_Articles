Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for
schizophrenia - outcomes for functioning,
distress and quality of life: a meta-analysis
Keith R. Laws1*, Nicole Darlington1, Tejinder K. Kondel2, Peter J. McKenna3 and Sameer Jauhar4
Abstract
Background: The effect of cognitive behavioural therapy for psychosis (CBTp) on the core symptoms of
schizophrenia has proven contentious, with current meta-analyses finding at most only small effects. However, it has
been suggested that the effects of CBTp in areas other than psychotic symptoms are at least as important and
potentially benefit from the intervention.
Method: We meta-analysed RCTs investigating the effectiveness of CBTp for functioning, distress and quality of life in
individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia and related disorders. Data from 36 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) met
our inclusion criteria- 27 assessing functioning (1579 participants); 8 for distress (465 participants); and 10 for quality of
life (592 participants).
Results: The pooled effect size for functioning was small but significant for the end-of-trial (0.25: 95% CI: 0.14 to 0.33);
however, this became non-significant at follow-up (0.10 [95%CI -0.07 to 0.26]). Although a small benefit of CBT was
evident for reducing distress (0.37: 95%CI 0.05 to 0.69), this became nonsignificant when adjusted for possible
publication bias (0.18: 95%CI -0.12 to 0.48). Finally, CBTp showed no benefit for improving quality of life (0.04:
95% CI: -0.12 to 0.19).
Conclusions: CBTp has a small therapeutic effect on functioning at end-of-trial, although this benefit is not
evident at follow-up. Although CBTp produced a small benefit on distress, this was subject to possible publication bias
and became nonsignificant when adjusted. We found no evidence that CBTp increases quality of life post-intervention.

Background
The first use of cognitive therapy to help people with
schizophrenia was in 1952 [1]. Beginning somewhat
later, with Kuipers et al. [2*], over 60 randomised con-
trolled trials (RCTs) have subsequently examined the ef-
ficacy of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for psychosis
(CBTp). These trials have typically looked at the effect-
iveness of CBTp in improving the core symptoms of
schizophrenia i.e., positive symptoms, or delusions and
hallucinations measured separately, and in some cases
negative symptoms. Recent meta-analyses of these trials
have converged on finding symptomatic improvement
that is in the small range (e.g. [3–9]. The most compre-
hensive of these meta-analyses - that of Jauhar et al. [7] -
additionally
found
no
effectiveness
against
positive
symptoms in trials with blinded outcome assessments.
Over a decade ago, Birchwood and Trower [10] intro-
duced the phrase ‘quasi-neuroleptic’ to describe the
symptom-focused approach of CBTp. They argued that
this view of CBTp was inappropriate and that the inter-
vention was more likely to have a distinctive profile of
effects that are complementary to rather than substitut-
ing for drug treatment. Such a view appears to be
reflected in the two principal clinical guidelines in use in
the UK, the National Institute for Care and Health
Excellence
(NICE)
and
the
Scottish
Intercollegiate

 Guidelines Network (SIGN). Thus, NICE [11] states that
“The aims of psychological & psychosocial interventions
in psychosis & schizophrenia are numerous. These
should include interventions to improve symptoms but
also those that address vulnerability, which are embed-
ded in developmental processes. The aims, therefore, in-
clude: reduction of distress associated with psychosis
symptoms… promoting social and educational recovery;
reducing depression and social anxiety … and relapse
prevention (p.32).” Similarly, SIGN [12] states: “The aim
[of CBTp] is to help the individual normalise and make
sense of their psychotic experiences, and to reduce the
associated distress and impact on functioning (p.55)”.
Similar sentiments are expressed in guidelines from else-
where in the world, e.g. the Royal Australian and New
Zealand College of Psychiatrists [13].
Nevertheless, the effect of CBTp on non-symptomatic
outcomes in schizophrenia has been relatively less inves-
tigated than its effect on symptoms. Nearly 10 years ago,
Wykes et al. [14] carried out a series of meta-analyses
that included 15 trials which evaluated functioning. The
pooled effect size was significant (Glass’s Δ = 0.38: 95%
CI 0.15 to 0.60); however, analysing the trials by study
quality (as measured using a unitary scale for this) re-
vealed a large and significant difference in effect size be-
tween high and low-quality trials (0.15 vs. 0.51). They
did not examine effect sizes for any follow-up period.
Several meta-analyses of functioning were also carried
out by the National Collaborating Centre for Mental
Health (NCCMH) (http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/workinpsy-
chiatry/nccmh.aspx) for the purposes of the 2009 NICE
guideline. These analyses assessed data relating to spe-
cific functioning scales and for all scales combined;
examining effects at end-of-treatment and follow-up as
well as against ‘treatment as usual’ (TAU) or other active
controls (such as befriending or supportive counselling).
The standardised mean difference (SMD) revealed that
CBTp had no significant impact on functioning com-
pared to TAU (K = 6: - 0.14, 95% CI -0.45 to 0.17), but
at 12-month follow up was marginally significant (K = 4:
-0.20, 95% CI-0.41 to − 0.00). When CBTp was con-
trasted with active controls, a medium effect emerged at
the end-of-treatment (K = 3: SMD -0.50, 95% CI -0.84 to
− 0.16); there was no meta-analysis against active con-
trols at follow-up. The small numbers of trials analysed
however, limits the reliability of findings from some of
the NICE meta-analyses. The other main limiting factor
concerning the meta-analyses by Wykes et al. [14] and
NICE [11], is that the data in both are now a decade old.
NICE [11] also reported on a small number of trials
measuring quality of life and found no significant advan-
tage for CBTp compared to supportive counselling at
the end of treatment (K = 3) (SMD 0.01, 95% CI –0.19 to
0.21) or for follow-up at either 52 weeks (K = 2; SMD
-0.18, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.47) or 78 weeks (K = 1; SMD
0.40, 95% CI -0.17 to 0.98). In their Cochrane review of
CBTp versus other psychosocial interventions, Jones et
al. [6] included only one trial that examined quality of
life [15] and no differential effect of CBTp was found ei-
ther at end of treatment or follow-up in this trial. No
meta-analysis appears to have examined the effects of
CBTp on distress.
The aim of the series of meta-analyses reported
here was to determine whether evidence shows that
CBTp improves aspects of the patient experience be-
yond
symptom-reduction.
Based
on
there
being
enough trials to permit meaningful pooling of data,
we selected three outcome variables: functioning, dis-
tress and quality of life.
Method
We initially considered the 52 RCTs retreived by Jauhar
et al. (2014), which covered the period of 1993 (the date
of the first published trial of cognitive behavioural ther-
apy in schizophrenia) to March 2013. We also searched
the trials previously excluded by Jauhar et al. These
studies were supplemented with a systematic search of
the literature using PubMED and Scopus to identify
RCTs of CBTp between the dates of March 2013 and
April 2018. Searches were unrestricted regarding lan-
guage and whether material was published or unpub-
lished. We also searched through reference sections of
papers that were considered eligible. Multiple searches
were conducted using the following terms and combina-
tions of terms:
“Cognitive Behavioural Therapy” AND “Psychosis”
AND “Randomised controlled trial”.
“Cognitive
Behavio*”
AND
“Psychosis”
AND
“Randomi*”.
“Cognitive Behavio*” AND “Psychosis” AND “RCT”.
“CBT” AND “Psychosis” AND “RCT”.

“Cognitive Behavio*” AND “schizo*”.

“Cognitive Behavio*” AND “Schizo*” AND “Random*”.
“CBT” AND “Schizo*” AND “Randomi*”.
“CBT” AND “Schizo*” AND “RCT”.
This search produced a further 16 studies. All 69 stud-
ies were then hand-searched by one of us (ND) for the
outcome measures of interest and counter-checked by
another (KRL).
Our inclusion criteria paralleled those used by Jauhar
et al. [7], Wykes et al. [14], NICE [11] and the Cochrane
Collaboration [6]. Thus, studies were included if a ma-
jority of the patients had a diagnosis of schizophrenia,
schizoaffective or non-affective functional psychosis, ei-
ther made clinically or according to diagnostic criteria.

 Trials could use any measure of functioning, distress or
quality of life (for details, see below). Studies also had to
include a parallel control group of any type, i.e. waitlist,
TAU or an intervention designed to control for the
non-specific effects of psychotherapy. We excluded
non-randomised trials and those which used inappropri-
ate randomisation methods (e.g. allocation by alternation
or
by
availability
of
the
intervention).
The
four
non-randomised trials that were located all also used
non-blinded outcome assessment and were low in over-
all quality (see [16–19]).
Determination of what types of therapy constituted
CBTp was relatively broad and followed Jauhar et al. [7]
– those that incorporated additional elements of therapy,
such as motivational interviewing, family engagement,
behaviour therapy and social skills training, were also in-
cluded. Following previous meta-analyses, we did not in-
clude
studies
that
delivered
CBT
as
part
of
a
multicomponent package of care that involved several
other interventions (sometimes referred to as integrated
treatment or similar). We included trials using both in-
dividual and group CBTp.
Data extraction
For functioning, trials used a variety of clinician-assessed
rating scales which included: the Global Assessment of
Functioning scale (GAF: [20]); the Social and Occupa-
tional Functioning Assessment Scale (SOFAS: [21]); the
Global Assessment Scale (GAS: [22]); the Multnomah
Community Ability Scale (MCAS: [23]); and the Life
Skills Profile (LSP: [24]). Other scales considered to be
includable were the Social Functioning Scale (SFS: [25]),
the Role Functioning Scale (RFS: [26]), the Social Behav-
iour Schedule (SBS: [27]), the Independent Living Skills
Survey (ILSS: [28]), and the Personal and Social Per-
formance Scale (PSP: [29]).
Studies were included if they measured the distress as-
sociated with the symptoms of psychosis. Outcomes re-
lating to depression and anxiety alone were not included
as these were considered to represent symptomatic mea-
sures. Where articles provided more than one outcome
measure for distress, ‘total distress’ scores were used.
Measures included: the ‘distress’ domain within the
Psychotic Symptom Rating Scale (PSYRATS: [30]); the
Global Severity Index (GSI: [31]); and a questionnaire
using a Likert scale ([32*]: On a scale from 0 to 10, how
bothered are you when you experience (specific hallucin-
ation) [or think about (specific delusion)]?).
The quality of life measures used in trials included: the
Quality of life scale (QLS: [33]); the World Health Or-
ganisation Quality Of Life Scale (WHOQOL-BREF:
[34]); the Quality of life, Enjoyment and Satisfaction
Questionnaire (Q-LES-Q: [35]); the Modular System for
quality of life (MSQoL: [36]); and the Manchester Short
Assessment of Quality of Life (MANSA: [37]).
Meta-analysis
Pooled effect sizes for the data were created using Compre-
hensive Meta-analysis, version 2 [38]. A random-effects
model was used in all analyses. Effect sizes were derived
from the post-intervention (or follow-up) scores using
Hedges g (i.e. the standardized mean difference using group
means divided by the pooled standard deviation: Eq. 1) and
corrected for the tendency towards overestimation in small
studies ([39] Eq. 2). When these data were not available in
a paper, authors were contacted. Effect sizes are described
using Cohen’s convention: an effect size of 0.20 was consid-
ered small, 0.50 moderate, and 0.80 large.

Heterogeneity was examined with Q and I2 statistics.
An I2 value of 0–40% suggests that heterogeneity may
not be important, 30–60% may represent moderate het-
erogeneity, 50–90% may represent substantial hetero-
geneity,
and
75–100%
may
represent
considerable
heterogeneity (see [40]). Publication bias was examined
using Duval and Tweedie’s [41] trim and fill technique,
which aims to estimate the number of missing studies
within an analysis and the effect that those studies might
have on outcomes. Moderator analyses, where feasible,
followed Jauhar et al. [7] and so, included comparisons
of blind vs non-blind outcome-assessment and the use
of active control vs treatment as usual. The latter cat-
egorical comparisons were conducted using a method
analogous to ANOVA.
Results
Thirty-six RCTs (37 samples) met our inclusion criteria
(See Fig. 1), some measuring more than one outcome.
Twenty-six samples assessed functioning, 8 assessed dis-
tress and 10 quality of life. See Table 1 for excluded
studies and main reason for exclusion.
Functioning
Functioning was assessed in 25 trials (with 26 samples:
see Additional file 1) providing a total of 1579 partici-
pants (780 received CBTp and 799 were in the control
condition). Of the 26 samples, 17 compared CBTp to
treatment as usual (TAU), while the remaining 9 com-
pared

 contact). The majority of studies used individual therapy
(22/25 - only [54*–56*], and used group therapy).
The pooled effect size for functioning across 26 sam-
ples was 0.25 (95%CI: 0.14 to 0.33, p < .001, positive sign
indicates CBTp better than control). The studies were
moderately heterogeneous (Q [25] = 50.66, p < .001) with
an I2 value of 50.66 (see forest plot in Fig. 2). Duval and
Tweedie’s Trim and Fill [41] analysis revealed no evi-
dence
of publication
bias. We re-ran
the
analysis
removing one outlier trial [57*], which was the only one
that revealed significantly worse functioning post CBT –
this increased the effect size to 0.28 (95%CI .15 to
.41) p < .001; Q [24] =39.52, p = .02, I2 = 39.27.
Blind vs nonblind assessment
We compared 19 studies where assessors were blinded
(masked) to treatment condition with 7 where assess-
ment was not blinded (unmasked) to the treatment
group.
The unmasked
trials
revealed
a
small
and
significant effect size of 0.29 (95% CI: 0.10 to 0.48,
p < .001); and the studies had low nonsignificant het-
erogeneity
(Q = 6.94
[6],
p = .33:
I2 = 13.59).
The
masked trials revealed a small significant effect size
of 0.22 (95% CI: 0.02 to 0.42, p = .03); these 19 stud-
ies were moderately heterogeneous (Q = 58.45 [18],
p < .001; I2 = 58.45).
Active versus non-active control
We compared 19 trials using treatment as usual (TAU)
as a control versus 7 trials using active control condi-
tions. The effect size for TAU was significant at 0.26
(95%CI .08 to .43), p = .01; and showed low-moderate
heterogeneity (Q = 34.83, df = 18, p = .01; I2 = 47.65). The
effect size for trials with an active control was nonsignif-
icant at 0.22 (95%CI -0.07 to 0.52, p = .14); and showed
moderate heterogeneity (Q = 16.25, df = 6, p = .012; I2 =
63.07). The effect sizes from trials using TAU and
active control did not significantly differ (Q = 0.03,
df = 1, p = .86).

pants (393 CBTp and 399 controls) and retention was
high with over 91% of the CBT and control participants
examined at end-of-trial being assessed at follow-up.
The pooled effect size for CBTp on functioning at
follow-up was nonsignificant 0.10 [95%CI -0.07 to 0.28],
p = .23 (see Fig. 3). The samples showed low heterogen-
eity (Q = 21.78, df = 15, p = .11; I2 = 31.12). Most trials
used blind assessment (K = 13: g = 0.12–0.08 to 0.32)
and did not differ significantly in effect size (Q = 0.14,
df = 1, p = .71) from nonblind trials (K = 3 g = 0.04–

 230 in control conditions). Of these studies, 7 were
against a treatment as usual (TAU) and 1 was against a
waitlist control. Most trials (7/8) used individual therapy
with only [59*] using group therapy.
The pooled effect size was significant at 0.37 (95% CI
0.05 to 0.69, p = .02). The studies were heterogeneous (Q
(7) = 17.27, p = .01) with an I2 value of 60.51 suggesting
moderate-high levels of true heterogeneity amongst the
studies. The forest plot is shown in Fig. 4.
Duval and Tweedie’s trim and fill bias analysis [41] im-
puted 3 trials (see Fig. 5). When the meta-analysis was
adjusted for this potential bias, the new effect size re-
duced and became nonsignificant (g = 0.18, 95% CI:
-0.12 to 0.48).
Most trials were non-blind and these showed a signifi-
cant distress reduction (K = 6, g = 0.43[95% CI 0.20 to
0.66]); however, the two blind trials [60*, 61*] produced a
nonsignificant effect (0.19 [95% CI -0.72 to 1.10]).
Quality of life
Quality of life was assessed in 10 samples from 9 trials
(see Additional file 3) with a total sample size of 592
(293 received CBTp and 299 in the control condition.
Of these studies, 1 was against an active control condi-
tion (psychoeducation/befriending), 7 were against a
treatment as usual (TAU condition), and 2 were against
a waitlist control. Three trials used group therapy ([59*,
62*, 63*], and) – the remaining 7 samples used individual
therapy.
CBTp had no significant impact on quality of life, with
an effect size close to zero at 0.04 (95% CI: -0.12 to 0.19,
p = .66). The studies were not heterogeneous (Q (9) =
7.19, p = .62) with an I2 value of 0. The forest plot in
Fig. 6 presents the effect sizes for each trial, showing
that none of the individual trials significantly improved
QoL; both group (K = 3 g = 0.15 95% CI -0.22 to 0.51)
and individual therapy were nonsignificant (K = 7, g =
0.01 95% CI -0.17 to 0.19) and I2 was zero in both.
When publication bias was examined, Duval and
Tweedie’s trim and fill [41] imputed 1 missing effect size.
With the analysis adjusted for this, the new effect size
was reduced slightly (g = 0.01, 95% CI: -0.15 to 0.16).
The five trials examining QoL under blind conditions
had a nonsignificant mean effect size of 0.06 [95% CI
-0.24 to 0.36, p = .69], as did the three trials assessing
QoL without blinding (0.16 [95%CI -0.20 to 0.52]
p = .39); two further studies were unclear about blinding
([63, 64*] was presented blind, however raters correctly
guessed 70% of the group assignments).
Discussion
As noted in the introduction, while more than a dozen
meta-analyses have examined whether CBTp reduces
the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia,
non-symptomatic
outcomes
have
been
somewhat
neglected. Two previous meta-analyses – both now a
decade old – have examined the impact of CBTp on
functioning [11, 14] but ours is the first to examine the
impact of CBTp across a range of non-symptomatic out-
comes,
including:
functioning
at
end-of
trial
and
follow-up and the impact on quality of life and distress.
Although a small benefit of CBTp for functioning
emerged at end-of-trial, this was non-significant at
follow-up. In 8 trials, CBT was found to produce a small
significant reduction in distress; however, evidence of
potential publication bias led to the imputing of 3 stud-
ies, halving the effect size and making it non-significant.
The effect was also moderated by blinding – significant
distress
reduction
was
only
found
in
trials
using
non-blind outcome assessment. Quality of life was un-
affected by CBTp and indeed, none of 10 samples docu-
mented a significant benefit.
With respect to functioning, our effect size of 0.25
(95% CI 0.14 to 0.33) for functioning is considerably
smaller than the 0.38 effect size reported by Wykes et al.
[14] in their meta-analysis of 15 trials - indeed, the
Wykes et al. [14] effect size falls beyond the upper end
of our 95% confidence intervals. One possible reason for
this reducing effect size is that 12 of 14 RCTs published
since Wykes et al’s 2008 [14] meta-analysis – and since

 NICE [11] published their current guidance on CBTp -
have produced nonsignificant outcomes. Importantly,
more recent studies also included large well-controlled
trials (e.g [65*]). Furthermore, our analysis of follow-up
data derived from 16 samples revealed that CBT did not
significantly improve functioning. This latter finding
contrasts with the findings reported by NICE; it seems
likely
that
this
reflects
the
fact
that
the
current
meta-analysis is much larger - involving four times as
many trials. Our findings provide an important update
on the multiple meta-analyses carried out for NICE
(2009), which was on small numbers of trials and pro-
duced mixed findings. NICE have still failed to update
their meta-analyses, which contain no trials post-2008;
and so, it might seem an appropriate time to update
their analyses and potentially, their recommendations
given the findings here. The repeated decisions by NICE
to not update CG178 with any trials post-2008 has also
been remarked upon in meta-analyses and indeed, by
the Chair of SIGN [7, 66].
With an effect size that was close to zero, we found no
suggestion that CBTp improves quality of life in people
diagnosed with schizophrenia. Our findings accord with
earlier smaller analyses of quality of life by NICE [11]
and the Cochrane Collaboration [6], both of which
found no evidence of CBTp being efficacious for this
outcome. Although the current number of trials remains
quite small (K = 9 and 10 samples), we found little to
suggest that missing trials or methodological factors -
such as blinding or type of control group - were playing
any role in this null finding. Indeed, every published trial
has reported a nonsignificant effect of CBTp on quality
of life; particularly noteworthy is one trial by van der
Gaag et al. [64*] which had large numbers (109 CBTp
and 97 controls) and an effect size of zero.
Despite CBTp being promoted as effective against dis-
tress by both NICE [11] and SIGN [12], this outcome
has received surprisingly little interest from triallists.
Only 8 in 67 RCTs that met our eligibility criteria re-
ported distress as an outcome and this was always as a

 secondary measure. Although significant at 0.37, the ef-
fect size for distress was prone to potential publication
bias and when adjusted for three potentially missing tri-
als, became small and nonsignificant at 0.18. Also note-
worthy is that several RCTs assessing distress had small
samples and so their power to detect true (small) effects
is likely to be low. Following Button et al. [67], it is pos-
sible to derive the median statistical power of each study
in the meta-analyses to obtain the overall effect size
(using the mean effect sizes as the best estimate of likely
true effect size). Doing this revealed that the power in
CBTp trials assessing distress was low at .22, whereas
those for quality of life and functioning were somewhat
better but still underpowered at .50 and .64 respectively.
The low level of power also accords with the evidence of
potential publication bias in trials measuring distress;
and may reflect the publishing of unreliable small trials
with positive, but not negative results. Future studies of
distress would need four times the current mean sample
size of 40 per group to reliably detect the effect size re-
ported in existing trials. Only one trial, that of Birch-
wood et al. [61*], comes close to the sample size
required, and this found increased distress following
CBTp. Clearly adequate powering is essential in future
trials – not only to accurately ascertain if CBTp reduces
distress, but to eliminate any possibly that it may in-
crease distress in some patients.
Conclusions
Our meta-analysis is the first to assess whether CBTp
improves quality of life or reduces distress in individuals
diagnosed with schizophrenia. We also present an up-
dated meta-analysis assessing the impact of CBTp on
functioning. On current evidence CBTp leads to a small
improvement in functioning which, however, is not sus-
tained. The case for beneficial effects on quality of life
and distress appear, from studies to date, to be weak.
Overall, the three meta-analyses performed provide only
equivocal support for the non-quasi-neuroleptic hypoth-
esis of CBTp, with its emphasis on these outcomes.
