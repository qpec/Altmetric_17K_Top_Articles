SUMMARY
Bacterial CRISPR-Cas systems utilize sequence-specific RNA-guided nucleases to defend against 
bacteriophage infection. As a counter-measure, numerous phages are known that produce proteins 
to block the function of Class 1 CRISPR-Cas systems. However, currently no proteins are known 
to inhibit the widely used Class 2 CRISPR-Cas9 system. To find these inhibitors, we searched 
cas9-containing bacterial genomes for the co-existence of a CRISPR spacer and its target, a 
potential indicator for CRISPR inhibition. This analysis led to the discovery of four unique type II-
A CRISPR-Cas9 inhibitor proteins encoded by Listeria monocytogenes prophages. More than half 
of L. monocytogenes strains with cas9 contain at least one prophage-encoded inhibitor, suggesting 
widespread CRISPR-Cas9 inactivation. Two of these inhibitors also blocked the widely used 
Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 when assayed in Escherichia coli and human cells. These natural 
Cas9-specific “anti-CRISPRs” present tools that can be used to regulate the genome engineering 
activities of CRISPR-Cas9.

INTRODUCTION
The ability to prevent attack from viruses is a hallmark of cellular life. Bacteria employ 
multiple mechanisms to resist infection by bacterial viruses (phages), including restriction 
enzymes and CRISPR-Cas systems (Labrie et al., 2010). CRISPR arrays consist of the DNA 
remnants of previous phage encounters (spacers), located between Clustered Regularly 
Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (Mojica et al., 2005). These spacers are transcribed 
to generate CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) that direct the binding and cleavage of specific nucleic 
acid targets (Brouns et al., 2008; Garneau et al., 2010). The CRISPR-associated (cas) genes 
required for immune function are often found adjacent to the CRISPR array (Marraffini, 
2015; Wright et al., 2016). Cas proteins perform many functions, including destroying 
foreign genomes (Garneau et al., 2010), mediating the acquisition of foreign sequences into 
the CRISPR array (Nuñez et al., 2014; Yosef et al., 2012) and facilitating the production of 
mature CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) (Deltcheva et al., 2011; Haurwitz et al., 2010).
CRISPR-Cas adaptive immune systems are both common and diverse in the bacterial world. 
Two distinct classes, encompassing six CRISPR types (I–VI) have been identified across 
bacterial genomes (Abudayyeh et al., 2016; Makarova et al., 2015), each with the ability to 
cleave target DNA or RNA molecules with sequence specificity directed by the RNA guide. 
The facile programmability of CRISPR-Cas systems has been widely exploited, opening the

 door to an array of novel genetic technologies, most prominently gene editing in animal cells 
(Barrangou and Doudna, 2016). Most technologies are based on Cas9 (Class 2, type II-A) 
from Streptococcus pyogenes (Spy), together with an engineered single guide RNA 
(sgRNA) because of the simplicity of the system (Jinek et al., 2012). Gene editing in animal 
cells has been successful with Spy Cas9 (Cong et al., 2013; Mali et al., 2013), Cas9 
orthologs within the II-A subtype (Ran et al., 2015), and new Class 2 single protein effectors 
such as Cpf1 (Type V (Zetsche et al., 2015)). Applications are also being developed through 
the characterization of Type VI CRISPR-Cas systems, represented by C2c2, which naturally 
cleave RNA (Abudayyeh et al., 2016; East-Seletsky et al., 2016). In contrast, the complex 
Class 1 CRISPR-Cas systems (Type I, III, and IV), consisting of RNA-guided multi-protein 
complexes and thus have been overlooked for most genomic applications. These systems 
are, however, the most common in nature, comprising ~75% of all bacterial CRISPR-Cas 
systems and nearly all systems in archaea (Makarova et al., 2015).
In response to the bacterial war on phage infection, phages, in turn, often encode inhibitors 
of bacterial immune systems that enhance their ability to either lyse their host bacterium or 
integrate into its genome (Samson et al., 2013). The first examples of phage-encoded “anti-
CRISPR” proteins came for the Class 1 type I-F and I-E systems in Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa (Bondy-Denomy et al., 2013; Pawluk et al., 2014). Remarkably, ten type I-F anti-
CRISPR and four type I-E anti-CRISPR genes have been discovered to date (Pawluk et al., 
2016), all of which encode distinct, small proteins (50–150 amino acids), previously of 
unknown function. Our biochemical investigation of four I-F anti-CRISPR proteins revealed 
that they directly interact with different Cas proteins in the multi-protein CRISPR-Cas 
complex to prevent either the recognition or cleavage of target DNA (Bondy-Denomy et al., 
2015). Anti-CRISPR proteins have distinct sequences (Bondy-Denomy et al., 2013), 
structures (Maxwell et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2016), and modes of action (Bondy-Denomy et 
al., 2015). These findings support the independent evolution of CRISPR-Cas inhibitors and 
suggests that many more are yet to be discovered. Indeed, a recent investigation exploited 
the conservation of signature anti-CRISPR associated (aca) gene with a predicted helix-turn-
helix (HTH) motif to identify anti-CRISPRs across proteobacteria, broadly spanning the 
type I-F CRISPR-Cas phylogeny (Pawluk et al., 2016).
Although anti-CRISPRs are both prevalent and diverse within proteobacteria, it is presently 
unknown whether anti-CRISPR proteins occur in other bacterial phyla. Likewise, it is also 
unclear if anti-CRISPRs exist for systems other than types I-E and I-F. In P. aeruginosa, type 
I anti-CRISPRs are expressed from integrated phage genomes (prophages) and caused the 
constitutive inactivation of the host CRISPR-Cas system (Bondy-Denomy et al., 2013). In 
such cases the prophage can possess a DNA target with perfect identity to a CRISPR spacer 
in the same cell, as the CRISPR-Cas system is inactivated. The genomic co-occurrence of a 
perfect spacer and its target DNA is called “self-targeting” (Figure 1A). Bacteria with self-
targeting require CRISPR-Cas inactivation for survival: in the absence of anti-CRISPR 
genes, the host genome will be cleaved in the act of targeting the prophage (Bondy-Denomy 
et al., 2013; Edgar and Qimron, 2010). Expression of an anti-CRISPR, therefore, neutralizes 
this risk. We surmised that genomes possessing a CRISPR system with apparent self-
targeting would be candidates for the identification of new CRISPR-Cas inhibitors. Here, we 
describe the identification of four previously unknown phage-encoded CRISPR-Cas9

 inhibitors in Listeria monocytogenes using a bioinformatics approach to identify incidents of 
self-targeting. We also demonstrate that two of these inhibitors can block the activity of S. 
pyogenes Cas9 in bacterial and human cells.
RESULTS
CRISPR-Cas9 in Listeria monocytogenes targets foreign DNA
Listeria monocytogenes is a facultative intracellular food-borne pathogen with a well 
characterized phage population. Many L. monocytogenes isolates have type II-A CRISPR-
Cas systems (Sesto et al., 2014) and their CRISPR spacers possess identity to many virulent, 
temperate, and integrated phages (Di et al., 2014; Sesto et al., 2014). However, there is no 
experimental evidence of canonical CRISPR-Cas function. We analyzed 275 genomes of L. 
monocytogenes and identified type II-A CRISPR-Cas9 systems (Lmo Cas9) in 15% (n = 41) 
of them (Figure 1B). Interestingly, we found eight genomes (3% of the total), with examples 
of self-targeting (ST; Figure 1B and 1C and Table S1), although the CRISPR-Cas9 system is 
anticipated to be functional as all requisite genes are present with no obvious mutations 
(Figure S1A). Many self-targeted protospacers were found in prophages, and thus we 
predicted that these prophages encode inhibitors of CRISPR-Cas9 that allow the stable co-
existence of a spacer-protospacer pair.
To test whether inhibitors were encoded by the prophages of L. monocytogenes, we first 
established the functionality of CRISPR-Cas9 in an L. monocytogenes strain (10403s) that 
does not exhibit self-targeting. To test the activity of this system we designed a plasmid (pT) 
possessing a targeted protospacer (i.e. a sequence that is complementary to a natural spacer 
in the CRISPR array) along with a cognate protospacer adjacent motif (PAM), a three base 
motif that is necessary for Cas9 binding (Figure 2A). We measured the transformation 
efficiency of 10403s with either pT or a control plasmid possessing a non-targeted sequence 
with an identical plasmid backbone (pNT). Transformation with pT yielded miniscule 
colonies relative to pNT (Figure 2B, leftmost panel), although the number of colonies that 
emerged upon prolonged incubation were the same (see Discussion for further analysis). To 
determine whether the 10403s prophage (ϕ10403s) was inhibiting CRISPR-Cas9 function in 
any way, a prophage-cured version of this strain (ϕcure) was tested, yielding the same tiny 
colonies (Figure 2B). The ϕcure strain was used for all subsequent experiments since it was 
indistinguishable from wt10403s in this assay. To confirm that the observed transformation 
inhibition was the result of CRISPR-Cas9 interference, we constructed a cas9-deletion 
strain. Transformation of this strain with pT and pNT produced colonies of indistinguishable 
size (Figure 2B). However, adding back cas9 to the L. monocytogenes chromosome under a 
constitutively active promoter completely prevented transformation with pT (Figure 2B, 
rightmost panel). Together, these experiments demonstrate that Cas9 is functional in L. 
monocytogenes 10403s at both endogenous and overexpressed levels, and limits 
transformation with a plasmid bearing a protospacer.
Resident prophages inactivate CRISPR-Cas9 in L. monocytogenes
To determine whether CRISPR-Cas9 may be disabled in a strain with self-targeting spacers, 
we examined immunity function in L. monocytogenes strain J0161, whose spacer 16

 perfectly matches a prophage (ϕJ0161a) in the same genome (Figure 1C). We could not 
detect any clearly deleterious CRISPR-Cas mutations in the CRISPR repeat, PAM, 
tracrRNA, Cas9, and the associated promoters of strain J0161 (Figures S1B-F and S2), 
suggesting that this self-targeting scenario was the result of inhibition and not loss of 
function. Since the type II-A CRISPR array of J0161 is distinct from that of 10403s, a 
J0161-specific targeted plasmid (pTJ0161) was used to test the function CRISPR-Cas9 in 
J0161. Consistent with the inactivation implied by self-targeting, there were no significant 
differences in transformation efficiency or colony size to distinguish pTJ0161 from pNT 
(Figure 2C). Thus, we reasoned that the J0161 genome may encode Cas9 inhibitors.
In search of the genetic basis for CRISPR-Cas9 inactivation in J0161, we focused on the 
prophage ϕJ0161a as a likely source of an inhibitor gene because it contained the self-
targeted sequence in this strain. To determine whether ϕJ0161a contained an inhibitor, the 
prophage-cured strain of 10403s was lysogenized with ϕJ0161a and assayed for CRISPR-
Cas9 functionality by plasmid transformation (Figure 2D). The acquisition of ϕJ0161a was 
sufficient to inactivate CRISPR-Cas9 function (Figure 2E, left panels), suggesting that this 
prophage encodes an inhibitor of CRISPR-Cas9. The ϕJ0161a prophage also inactivated 
plasmid targeting in a strain constitutively expressing cas9, suggesting that the inhibitory 
mechanism does not operate by disrupting natural regulation of the cas9 promoter (Figure 
2E, right panels).
Given that the ϕJ0161a prophage inhibited CRISPR-Cas9 function in 10403s, and the 
endogenous ϕ10403s prophage did not, we compared the genomes of these two closely 
related phages to identify the regions of difference (Figure 3A). In addition to sharing 39 
core phage genes with >40% protein sequence identity, ten non-overlapping unique clusters 
of genes were identified (cluster boundaries were chosen based on predicted operon 
structure, with 1–12 genes per cluster). Each cluster was cloned and integrated into the 
genome of prophage-cured 10403s and assayed for CRISPR-Cas9 function. Of the ten 
fragments, seven were successfully introduced into L. monocytogenes, while three 
fragments could not be inserted in the L. monocytogenes genome and were presumably 
toxic in isolation. Plasmid transformation assays revealed that ϕJ0161a fragment 1 was the 
only fragment capable of inhibiting CRISPR-Cas9, indicating that this fragment encoded at 
least one CRISPR-Cas9 inhibitor (Figure 3B). Expressing the individual genes from this 
four-gene fragment led to the conclusive identification of two anti-CRISPR genes, 
LMOG_03146 and LMOG_03147 (herein referred to as acrIIA1 and acrIIA2, respectively) 
while LMOG_03145 and LMOG_03148 (orfB and orfA, respectively) had no anti-CRISPR 
activity (Figure 3B). Deletion of both acrIIA1 and acrIIA2 from a 10403s::ϕJ0161a lysogen 
restored CRISPR-Cas9 function, confirming that these are the only anti-CRISPR genes in 
ϕJ0161a (Figure 3B, rightmost panels).
Anti-CRISPR genes are widespread in L. monocytogenes prophages
To identify additional type II-A anti-CRISPRs, we examined the genomic position 
analogous to that of acrIIA1 and acrIIA2 in related L. monocytogenes prophages. A 
recurring anti-CRISPR (acr) locus containing acrIIA1 within a small operon (2–5 genes) of 
highly conserved gene order was identified between the “left” integration site and the genes

 involved in cell lysis (Figure 4A). We identified five additional protein families conserved 
within acr loci. To test these families for anti-CRISPR function, we cloned and integrated 
representatives into the 10403s genome and assayed for transformation efficiency of pT and 
pNT. Two new genes were identified that were capable of CRISPR inactivation (acrIIA3 and 
acrIIA4), while the remaining three (orfC, D, E) were not (Figure 3C, Figure S3).
To determine whether CRISPR-Cas9 inactivation in L. monocytogenes is pervasive, we next 
analyzed the conservation pattern for each anti-CRISPR. Although each acrIIA gene was 
sufficient to inactivate CRISPR-Cas9 in isolation, we observed a common presence of 
acrIIA1 in most acr loci. Nearly all instances (88%) of acrIIA2-4 were found upstream of 
the helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif-containing acrIIA1, suggesting that this gene may be a 
marker for acr loci (Figure 4A and 4B). The most common scenario in 119 acr loci was 
either acrIIA1-2 or acrIIA1-2-3, together representing 66% of acr loci (Figure 4B). In total, 
acrIIA genes were identified in 25% of L. monocytogenes genomes, with 53% of L. 
monocytogenes cas9-containing strains possessing at least one anti-CRISPR in the same 
genome (Figure 4C). Many instances of L. monocytogenes genomes possessing multiple 
acrIIA-encoding prophages were also identified (Supplementary Table 1). Furthermore, at 
least one acrIIA gene was found in the genomes of all eight instances of self-targeting that 
were initially identified (Figure 1B, Supplementary Table 1), explaining how these scenarios 
are stable. Together, these data suggest widespread prophage-mediated inactivation of 
CRISPR-Cas9 in L. monocytogenes.
Previous HTH-containing anti-CRISPR associated (aca) genes were used as markers to 
identify novel type I anti-CRISPR genes (Pawluk et al., 2016), although the aca genes did 
not have anti-CRISPR activity themselves. We hypothesized that acrIIA1 could fulfill the 
role of such a marker. A comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of acrIIA1 revealed that 
homologs were conserved widely across Firmicutes, in both mobile elements and core 
genomes (Figure 5A). A family of distantly related acrIIA1 homologs was identified in 
Listeria genomes, as exemplified by the orfD gene, which had been independently identified 
as an acr locus member that also occurs upstream of acrIIA4 homologs in contexts outside 
of prophages (Figure 4A and Table S1). While orfD lacked anti-CRISPR activity in a 
functional assay (Figure 3B), its co-occurrence with a bona fide acr gene suggests that the 
broad acrIIA1/orfD superfamily could be used as a marker to identify new acr genes. Future 
work will be necessary to determine whether the HTH-containing genes in these systems 
serve as effective markers for novel anti-CRISPR discovery.
To determine the homology landscape of acrIIA2-4, additional phylogenetic analyses were 
performed. Unlike acrIIA1, which was widespread across Firmicutes core genomes, the 
other three acr genes were mostly restricted to prophages in Listeria. Three distinct sequence 
families of acrIIA2 were identified, all restricted to Listeria siphophages (a family of 
longtailed, non-contractile phages) (Figure 5B), while two acrIIA3 families were observed 
in the genomes of siphophages infecting Listeria and Streptococcus (Figure 5C). Lastly, 
acrIIA4 was observed in two distinct sequence families, one in Listeria siphophages and 
plasmids, and the other in a group of obligate virulent myophages (long contractile-tailed 
phages) (Figure 5D). While acrIIA2 and acrIIA3 were nearly always found with acrIIA1, 
acrIIA4 often occurred in the absence of acrIIA1 homologs in phages and mobile elements

 of Listeria. For example, the family of acrIIA4 in virulent phages are distinct from the other 
family of acrIIA4 homologs in that they have an ~70 amino acid C-terminal extension in the 
predicted protein and do not occur with the HTH-containing genes acrIIA1 or orfD, 
suggesting potential mechanistic and evolutionary distinctions between these acrIIA4 
families. Together, these analyses reveal ample sequence space for surveying homologous 
acr genes for specificity determinants and suggest an active arms race between cas9 and 
mobile elements in L. monocytogenes.
AcrIIA2 and AcrIIA4 inhibit S. pyogenes Cas9
To determine the versatility of the Lmo Cas9 AcrIIA proteins, we asked whether these 
inhibitors were functional on the related Cas9 protein from S. pyogenes (Spy, 53% identical 
to Lmo Cas9). This ortholog has been used widely for biotechnological applications as an 
RNA-guided nuclease (Barrangou and Doudna, 2016), as well as for programmable gene 
repression by a catalytically deactivated mutant (dCas9) (Gilbert et al., 2013; Qi et al., 
2013). Using an E. coli strain that carries Spy dCas9, we tested whether AcrIIA proteins 
block dCas9 from interfering with transcription of a chromosomal RFP reporter gene 
(Figure 6A). In a genetic background lacking inhibitors, the presence of an sgRNA and 
dCas9 reduced RFP fluorescence ~40-fold (2.6% relative to that of a strain with no sgRNA). 
acrIIA1 had no impact on dCas9-mediated transcriptional repression, nor did orfA, orfC, or 
orfD, negative controls that had no anti-CRISPR activity in L. monocytogenes. acrIIA2 
partially blocked dCas9 function, with fluorescence reduced only 4-fold (25% relative to the 
no guide control), while acrIIA4 nearly completely blocked dCas9, with fluorescence at 
85% of the no guide control (Figure 6B). We could not obtain meaningful data from acrIIA3 
because the protein was toxic to E. coli. This lowered the recorded cell count during flow 
cytometry (see Figure S4a) and lead to large variability in the fluorescence measurements. A 
homolog of acrIIA3 from S. pyogenes (accession number: AND04610.1) with 45% 
sequence identity to Lmo_acrIIA3 was tested, but also resulted in impaired growth of E. coli 
(Figure S4b). The mechanism of acrIIA3 toxicity in E. coli remains to be determined. We 
conclude that the acrIIA2 and acrIIA4 inhibit Spy dCas9 in E. coli to different degrees.
Given the common application of Spy Cas9 in eukaryotic cells, we next tested the AcrIIA 
proteins for their ability to block gene editing in human cells. HEK293T cells with an 
inducible, chromosomally-integrated eGFP reporter gene were transiently transfected with a 
plasmid expressing both Spy Cas9 and an sgRNA targeting eGFP in the presence or absence 
of vectors expressing human codon optimized acrIIA genes. After allowing gene editing to 
proceed for 36 h, eGFP was induced for 12 h, and cellular fluorescence was then measured 
by flow cytometry (Figure 6C). In the presence of Cas9 and the eGFP sgRNA, gene editing 
resulted in a 25% decrease in the number of GFP positive cells, while co-expression with 
acrIIA2 or acrIIA4 prevented Cas9-based gene editing (Figure 6D). We additionally tested 
the S. pyogenes homolog of acrIIA3 (Spy_acrIIA3), which was not toxic in human cells, but 
it had no impact on Cas9 function in this assay. acrIIA1 was non-functional in human cells, 
as was the negative control, orfA. Taken together with dCas9 experiments in E. coli, these 
data demonstrate the utility of the AcrIIA2 and AcrIIA4 proteins to inhibit the function of an 
orthologous Cas9 in heterologous hosts. These reagents, therefore, represent new tools in the 
CRISPR-Cas9 genome engineering toolkit.

 DISCUSSION
Phage-encoded inhibitors of bacterial immune systems emerge due to the strong selective 
pressures in the evolutionary arms race between these two entities (Samson et al., 2013). The 
first identification of phage encoded anti-CRISPRs in type I CRISPR-Cas systems hinted 
that more CRISPR-Cas inhibitors existed, but methods were lacking for their discovery. 
Here, we present a bioinformatics strategy that uses “self-targeting” as a genomic marker for 
CRISPR-Cas inhibitor genes (Figure 1A). This approach led to the identification of four 
different type II-A CRISPR-Cas9 inhibitors (Figure 3 and 4A), which are collectively 
present in half of all Cas9-encoding L. monocytogenes genomes, including all genomes with 
self-targeting (Figure 4C). We anticipate that this approach will be helpful for identifying acr 
genes in other CRISPR-Cas systems, although a distinct mechanism for tolerance of self-
targeting has been described for type III systems (Goldberg et al., 2014; Samai et al., 2015).
To facilitate the identification of AcrIIA proteins, we first demonstrate a functional CRISPR-
Cas9 system in L. monocytogenes (Figure 2B). Previous studies of CRISPR-Cas in this 
organism have focused on the type I-B system and an associated orphan CRISPR array 
lacking cas genes (Mandin et al., 2007; Sesto et al., 2014). Although no canonical CRISPR-
Cas function had been established for either system previously, the orphan array was shown 
to be processed by a host ribonuclease to generate non-coding RNAs (Mandin et al., 2007; 
Sesto et al., 2014). To observe function for the type II-A CRISPR-Cas system, we used a 
standard transformation efficiency assay, showing that CRISPR-Cas9 function in strain 
10403s is able to limit transformation of a plasmid in a sequence specific manner (Figure 2A 
and 2B). Given the small colony phenotype observed during transformation of 10403s with 
the targeted plasmid (pT), we suspect that endogenous levels of cas9 expression are not 
sufficient to totally clear the plasmid. Either a small fraction of cells retain the plasmid, or 
alternatively, cells temporarily possess the plasmid at a reduced copy number, resulting in 
the small colony phenotype. Consistent with low endogenous expression of cas9 leading to 
either form of incomplete plasmid clearance, increased expression of cas9 resulted in an 
elimination of detectable transformants in this assay (Figure 2B).
Among the strains with self-targeting, we selected J0161 for further analysis. Using the 
transformation efficiency assay, we observed no plasmid targeting in this strain (Figure 2C), 
an observation consistent with the presence of an inhibitor. Indeed, the immune system was 
inactivated when the ϕJ0161a prophage was transferred to the CRISPR-Cas9-active strain 
10403s (Figure 2D). Furthermore, we observed that ϕJ0161a can inactivate CRISPR-Cas9 
function in a strain that overexpresses Cas9 (Figure 2E). Mechanistically, this demonstrates 
that inhibitors are unlikely to function by disrupting the transcriptional regulation of Cas9 
and are sufficiently expressed from the integrated prophage to cope with enhanced Cas9 
levels.
To identify candidate anti-CRISPR genes, related prophages from CRISPR-active strain 
10403s and a prophage that inhibits CRISPR-Cas9 from strain J0161 were compared, and a 
process-of-elimination cloning approach was taken (Figure 3A). Two isolated acr genes 
(acrIIA1 and acrIIA2) were first identified in ϕJ0161a (Figure 3B). In searching for more 
anti-CRISPRs, we find that conserved genomic positioning in related phages is a good proxy

 for identifying distinct type II-A Cas9 inhibitor proteins, despite a lack of sequence 
conservation between the proteins themselves (Figure 4A). This has been observed 
previously in studies of Type I-F and I-E anti-CRISPRs (Bondy-Denomy et al., 2013; 
Pawluk et al., 2014). In L. monocytogenes, the high prevalence of Cas9 inhibitors in 
prophages suggests the widespread inactivation of CRISPR-Cas9 function (Figure 4C). At 
present, we do not understand whether there is a mechanistic link to explain the common co-
occurrence of acrIIA1 with other anti-CRISPRs (Figure 4A and 4B). Although this gene is 
sufficient to inactivate CRISPR-Cas9 function in a plasmid challenge assay, we speculate 
that it could act as a co-factor or regulator of other acrIIA genes during infection or 
lysogeny, thus explaining the genomic associations observed. Future work will be necessary 
to understand whether AcrIIA1 is, in fact, a bi-functional protein in this regard and more 
broadly, whether its superfamily is a marker for acr genes.
Phylogenetic analyses demonstrate common occurrences of acrIIA2-4 in mobile elements in 
Listeria mobile elements (Figure 5). Inhibiting the adaptive immune system likely aids 
horizontal gene transfer in this organism by blocking Cas9-based targeting and adaptation 
(Heler et al., 2015). In addition to the family of prophages where these acrIIA genes were 
first identified, homologs were also found in distant siphophages, myophages and plasmids 
(Supplementary Table 1). Most notably, the acrIIA4 homologs encoded by virulent 
myophages did not have acrIIA1 superfamily homologs in their vicinity. Furthermore, the 
presence of acrIIA1 and acrIIA3 homologs in genera outside of Listeria demonstrates that 
CRISPR-Cas9 inactivation may be common-place in the Firmicutes.
Many potential mechanisms could explain CRISPR-Cas9 inactivation. In their native hosts, 
L. monocytogenes, we have defined anti-CRISPRs by their ability to inhibit Lmo Cas9-
based targeting of a plasmid. Furthermore, by demonstrating the efficacy of acrIIA2 and 
acrIIA4 in heterologous hosts with engineered elements (i.e. cas9 promoter, sgRNA design 
and promoter) we conclude acr-mediated transcriptional repression of the CRISPR-Cas9 
system is unlikely. Using the orthologous Spy Cas9, it is clear that AcrIIA2 and AcrIIA4 
have broad specificity, given that Lmo Cas9 and Spy Cas9 only share 53% sequence identity. 
AcrIIA2 and AcrIIA4 likely target regions conserved between the two Cas9 proteins. Type I 
anti-CRISPRs function by binding directly to the Cas proteins required for target 
interference and preventing DNA binding or DNA cleavage (Bondy-Denomy et al., 2015). 
By extension, we expect a similar mechanism for AcrIIA2 and AcrIIA4, given their ability 
to function in heterologous hosts. The enhanced efficacy of acrIIA2 in the cleavage-based 
Cas9 assay relative to the dCas9 based assay suggests that it may inhibit both binding and 
cleavage to some degree, with cleavage inhibition manifesting as a full inactivation of Cas9 
function. However, comparing the results of these two experiments, it is important to note 
the differences between the stability of Cas9 and dCas9 interactions with the mammalian 
and bacterial genomes, respectively. Given the efficacy of AcrIIA4 in blocking dCas9-based 
function (Figure 6B), stable DNA-binding is likely inhibited, although whether this is 
through a direct interaction with Cas9 remains to be seen.
The identification and future mechanistic dissection of type II-A inhibitors will provide 
valuable new reagents for studying canonical CRISPR-Cas9 function in natural and 
engineered settings. The ability of AcrIIA proteins to block Spy Cas9 in E. coli and human

 cells suggests that these proteins can provide a post-translational “off-switch” for Cas9. This 
could add a layer of regulation on this powerful system that can be applied in eukaryotic 
systems to control genome engineering. This new addition to the CRISPR-Cas9 toolbox 
could enable new applications, such as specifically reversing the effects of dCas9 binding to 
a genomic locus, or limiting the amount of time that Cas9 is active in the nucleus to reduce 
off-target gene editing. It will be important to continue to exploit the abundant tools 
provided to us from the phage-bacteria arms race as we expand the search for inhibitor 
proteins.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Microbes—Listeria monocytogenes strains were cultured on Brain-Heart Infusion (BHI) 
medium. Escherichia coli strains were cultured on LB medium.
Cell lines—Human Embryonic Kidney 293 plus T cell antigen (HEK293T, CRL-3216, 
ATCC) cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) supplemented 
with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Atlanta Biologicals) and 50μg/mL penicillin/
streptomycin (P/S, UCSF CCF).
METHOD DETAILS
Assay of CRISPR-Cas9 in L. monocytogenes
Plasmid-transformation assay of CRISPR-Cas9: Targeted (pT; pNT for J0161; pRAU31) 
and non-targeted (pNT; pTJ0161; pRAU29) plasmids for L. monocytogenes 10403s were 
constructed by ligating annealed primer pairs into the HindIII and BamHI sites of pKSV7. 
See Table S3 for plasmid-insert sequences. L. monocytogenes strains were transformed with 
0.5–1.0 μg pT or pNT by electroporation. Electrocompotent cells were prepared and 
transformed as described (Park and Stewart, 1990; Zemansky et al., 2009). Transformations 
were diluted 10-fold into BHI and recovered for two hours, shaking at 30°C. Recovered 
cultures were plated on BHI with 1.5% agar and 7.5 μg/ml chloramphenicol to select for pT 
or pNT. For pPL2oexL integrants, tetracycline selection (2 μg/ml) was maintained 
throughout the procedure, with exception to recovery cultures, which were performed 
without selection. Whereas plates that contained only chloramphenicol were incubated at 
30°C for 36–40 hours prior to imaging, plates that also contained tetracycline were 
incubated at 30°C for 64–72 hours. Plate images were collected using the Gel Doc™ EZ Gel 
Documentation System (BioRad) and Image Lab (BioRad) software.
Construction of pPL2oexL-integrants in L. monocytogenes 10403s: The pPL2oexL 
plasmid for constitutive chromosomal expression of genes in L. monocytogenes was derived 
from pPL2 (Lauer et al., 2002) (See Figure S6). Individual genes or phage fragments were

 PCR-amplified from genomic DNA and cloned into pPL2oexL by Gibson Assembly. 
pPL2oexL-derivative plasmids were electroporated into nonlysogenic 10403s, using a 
procedure like that which was employed for the plasmid-transformation assay of CRISPR-
Cas9 (see text under previous heading). Transformations were recovered for two hours, 
shaking at 37°C and were plated on BHI-agar with 2 μg/ml tetracycline. Colonies emerged 
after 36–48 hours incubating at 37°C, and were re-streaked once on the same selective 
medium to ensure genotypic homogeneity.
Construction of a 10403s::ϕJ0161a lysogen: Phage was induced from L. monocytogenes 
strain J0161 by exposure to ultraviolet radiation as described previously (Loessner and 
Busse, 1990). 10403s::ϕJ0161a lysogens were isolated from plaques that resulted from 
spotting amplified J0161 phage stock on a lawn of nonlysogenic 10403s (suspended in BHI 
with 0.7% agar and 2.5 mM CaCl2). Plaques emerged after 16 hours incubation at 30°C. 
Lysogeny was confirmed by PCR, as described (Lauer et al., 2002).
Construction of markerless chromosomal deletion strains: Markerless deletions of cas9 
and acrIIA1-2 were constructed by allelic exchange in nonlysogenic 10403s and 
10403s::ϕJ0161a, respectively. Up- and down-stream (700–1000 base pairs) regions flanking 
the genes to be deleted were fused by overlap-extension PCR and ligated into pKSV7. The 
Δcas9 genotype was inserted between the HindIII and BamHI restriction sites, whereas the 
ΔacrA1-2 genotype was inserted between the SacI and BamHI restriction sites. Knockout 
vectors were transformed by electroporation. Subsequent manipulations were performed as 
previously reported (Camilli et al., 1993).
Bioinformatic analyses
Identification of self-targeting CRISPR-Cas systems: L. monocytogenes genome 
sequences were downloaded from NCBI. Type-IIA CRISPR arrays were identified within 
individual genomes using CRISPRfinder (Grissa et al., 2007) or CRISPRDetect (Biswas et 
al., 2016) web utilities. See Figure S1B for a representative L. monocytogenes type II-A 
CRISPR array. Self-targeting CRISPR-Cas systems were identified using the CRISPRtarget 
web utility (Biswas et al., 2013) by searching individual L. monocytogenes genomes with 
their own CRISPR arrays. Bona fide self-targeting events were defined as perfect matches 
lacking spacer-protospacer mutations in the PAM-proximal region (20 bp), concurrent with a 
cognate PAM sequence (5′-NGG-3′). See Table S1 for a list of self-targeting strains.
Phylogenetic reconstruction of AcrIIA protein families: AcrIIA2- (AEO04363.1), 
AcrIIA3- (CBY03209.1) and AcrIIA4- (AEO04689.1) homologous protein sequences were 
acquired by BLASTp searches of all the non-redundant protein sequence database of NCBI 
on November 5, 2016. Full length (>78% query coverage) sequences of high homology (E 
value < 1e-04) were downloaded and aligned using Muscle (Edgar, 2004) in MEGA6 
(Tamura et al., 2013). Phylogenetic reconstructions of each protein family were performed 
in MEGA6 using the neighbor-joining method with the Poisson model for amino acid 
substitution, uniform rates among sites and pairwise deletion of gaps. Reconstructions were 
tested using the bootstrap method (1000 replications). Reconstruction images were then 
edited for clarity in Illustrator (Adobe). AcrIIA1- (AEO04364.1) homologous protein

 sequences were acquired by four iterations of psiBLASTp searches of the non-redundant 
protein sequence database of NCBI on October 26, 2016. The position-specific scoring 
matrix (PSSM) was enchriched with all full-length (>80%) protein sequences. Sequences 
were downloaded, aligned and reconstructed using the same methodology that was 
employed for the analysis of AcrIIA2, 3 and 4 (see above). However, in the case of AcrIIA1, 
sequences with large insertions (>30 amino acids) were removed from the sequence 
alignments, prior to phylogenetic reconstruction.
Analysis of gene-conservation patterns: The conservation of acrIIA1, acrIIA2, acrIIA3, 
acrIIA4 and cas9 were catalogued in reference to a control gene (cysteinyl-tRNA synthetase) 
that occurs once in all L. monocytogenes genomes. BLASTp searches were performed to 
acquire lists of genome-specific accession numbers for encoded proteins. These were used 
as surrogates for genes to assess conservation. Lists were compiled into a single table and 
sorted so that individual rows of data included accession numbers for all proteins of interest 
encoded within a single genome.
Inhibition of Spy-CRISPRi in E. coli
Reporter strain construction: Our E. coli Spy-CRISPRi reporter system uses integrated 
components of the previously reported CRISPRi system (Qi et al., 2013) with minor 
modifications. The promoter for mrfp was modified in the entry vector by changing the 
promoter from PLlacO-1 to a minimal synthetic promoter (BBa_J23119) (http://
parts.igem.org/), PCR amplified, and integrated into BW25113 at nfsA by recombineering as 
described. The mrfp-targeting sgRNA was cloned into the site-specific integrating plasmid 
pCAH63 under control of PLlacO-1 to generate pCs550-r, and integrated at lambda att using 
the helper plasmid pINT-ts (Haldimann and Wanner, 2001), selecting for chloramphenicol 
resistance. Conjugation was used to move a chromosomal dcas9 cassette into recipient 
strains harboring mrfp, sgRNA or both. A “pseudo-Hfr” strain isogenic with BW25113, 
carries the transfer region from F and a spectinomycin marker integrated downstream of 
rhaM (4086kb) (Typas et al., 2008). A “pseudo-Hfr” dcas9 donor strain was constructed by 
integrating dcas9 and a gentamycin resistance marker at the Tn7 att site (Choi et al., 2005), 
adjacent to the origin of transfer. dcas9 was cloned from pdCas9-bacteria (Addgene #44249) 
under control of BBa_J23105 (http://parts.igem.org/). Putative Cas9 inhibitor proteins were 
cloned into pBAD24 (Guzman et al., 1995) by Gibson Assembly (NEB) and transformed 
into the Spy-CRISPRi strains by electroporation.
Flow cytometry: Strains were grown overnight in LB with arabinose in deep 96-well plates, 
and then back-diluted 1:400 into fresh LB with arabinose (to maintain expression of the 
inhibitor) and IPTG (to induce expression of the sgRNA). After 2.5hr growth (OD~0.4) 
cultures were fixed using 1.5% final formaldehyde and quenched with glycine, and then 
diluted 1:30 into phosphate buffered saline. Red fluorescence levels were measured using an 
LSRII flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) using the yellow/green laser (561 nm) and the PE-
Texas Red® detector (610/20 nm). Data for at least 20,000 cells were collected, and median 
fluorescence values were extracted using FlowJo (FlowJo, LLC). Error bars represent the 
standard deviation from 3 or more biological replicates. Data from representative samples 
were plotted as histograms using FlowJo.

 Inhibition of Cas9 cleavage in human cells—An eGFP-targeting crRNA was ordered 
as complementary single-stranded DNA oligos (IDT) and cloned into BbsI linearized pX330 
(Addgene, Zhang lab) to generate a single vector expressing S. pyrogenes Cas9-NLS and an 
eGFP-targeting CRISPR cassette. One candidate (orf) and three validated (acr) acrIIA genes 
were codon-optimized for human cell expression, synthesized in vitro (IDT, GeneBlock), 
and cloned into BamHI/EcoRI linearized pcDNA3.1(+) by Gibson assembly. Similarly, the 
gene encoding enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein (eGFP) was synthesized and cloned into 
BamHI/EcoRI linearized pLVX-TetOne-Puro (Clontech). Doxycycline-inducible eGFP 
lentivirus was produced in Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK)293T cells (ATCC) by 
cotransfection (polyJet, SignaGen) with Gag-Pol packaging construct and VSV-G envelope 
(pMD2.G, Addgene). Lentiviruses were precipitated from the cellular supernatant at 4°C by 
incubation in a final concentration of 8.5% Poly(ethylene glycol) average Mn 6000 
(PEG-6000) and 0.3M NaCl for 4 hours. Viruses were concentrated at 3500 RPM for 20 
minutes in a spinning bucket rotor, suspended in 1 mL 1xPBS, and preserved at −80. One-
thousandth viral preparation by volume was used to transduce 250,000 HEK293T cells and 
successful integrants purified by selection in 1 μg/mL puromycin for 48 hours.
Polyclonal HEK293T cells with a chromosomally-integrated, inducible eGFP cassette were 
expanded, plated, and transfected with the eGFP-targeting CRISPR construct and each of the 
bacteriophage genes at different ratios in triplicate (Trans-IT, Mirus). An empty vector was 
used to equalize the total mass of transfected plasmid across each sample. 36 hours after 
transfection, cells were treated with 2 μg/mL doxycycline to induce eGFP expression. 12 
hours later, cells were suspended by incubation in PBS-EDTA, fixed in 1% formaldehyde 
PBS, and percent eGFP-positive cells monitored by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur, 
Gladstone Flow Cytometry Core). Data was normalized to no sgRNA controls and presented 
as the average percent eGFP-positive cells +/− standard deviation.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
All experiments were conducted with at least three biological replicates (N >= 3). Statistical 
parameters are reported in the Figures and the Figure Legends. Additional statistical tests 
were not performed.
DATA AND SOFTWARE AVAILABILITY
The accession numbers, locus tags and coding sequences for individual genes tested for 
CRISPR-Cas9 inhibition activity are disclosed in Figure S3. Additional accession numbers 
for AcrIIA homologs are reported in Table S1.

 Figure 1. A survey for CRISPR-Cas9 genomic self-targeting (ST) in Listeria monocytogenes
(A) A schematic depicting the principle of genomic self-targeting, where a mobile genetic 
element (MGE) possesses a target sequence for a spacer in a CRISPR array in the same 
genome. CRISPR-Cas9 function in this “self-targeting genome” is presumably inactive for 
continued cell viability.
(B) The abundance of genomes with (red) and without (gray) cas9-linked self-targeting (ST), 
in L. monocytogenes genomes. See Table S1 for a list of self-targeting strains.
(C) An example of an ST event, where spacer 16 in the type II-A CRISPR array of strain 
J0161 has a perfect PAM and protospacer match with a resident prophage (ϕJ0161a). See 
Figure S1B for the entire CRISPR array.

 Figure 2. A prophage from L. monocytogenes J0161 inhibits CRISPR-Cas9 function
(A) The type II-A CRISPR-Cas locus in L. monocytogenes 10403s. Four cas genes and the 
upstream tracrRNA are indicated, along with a CRISPR array containing 30 spacers. The 
predicted direction of transcription is indicated with black arrows. Subsequent experiments 
utilize a non-targeted plasmid (pNT) and a targeted plasmid (pT) that has a protospacer 
matching spacer 1 in this strain.
(B) Representative pictures of colonies of Lmo 10403s wild type (wt), prophage-cured 
(ϕcure), cas9-deletion strain (Δcas9), and a cas9 overexpression strain (Δcas9 + cas9) after 
being transformed with pT or pNT plasmids. Bar graphs below the plates show the 
calculated transformation efficiency (colony forming units per μg of plasmid). Data are 
represented as the mean of three biological replicates +/− SD. L.D. limit of detection, 
transformants with small colonies denoted with #.
(C) Plasmid-targeting assay with wild type J0161 (contains the ϕJ0161a prophage; 
experiment conducted as in (B), except with pTJ0161 as the targeted plasmid) is shown in red 
to denote self-targeting (as in Figure 1).
(D) A schematic demonstrating the construction of a 10403s strain containing the prophage 
ϕJ0161a (10403s::ϕJ0161a). See STAR Methods for details. (E) Plasmid-targeting assay 
with 10403s lysogenized with the ϕJ0161a prophage (10403s::ϕJ0161a) with endogenous 
(no mod) or overexpressed cas9 (Δcas9 + cas9; experiment conducted as in (B)).

 Figure 3. Identification of four distinct anti-CRISPR proteins
(A) Comparison of the open reading frames from two similar prophages from L. 
monocytogenes 10403s and J0161. Unique genes (red) comprising ten fragments of ϕJ0161 
were tested for CRISPR-Cas9 inhibition in 10403s. n.e., No effect on CRISPR-Cas9 activity, 
tox., fragment toxic when expressed, t., location of self-targeted protospacer. The encircled 
fragment exhibited anti-CRISPR activity with two genes (acrAII1, acrAII2) independently 
capable of inhibiting CRISPR-Cas activity. Conserved (grey) genes were not tested. For 
reference, phage genes involved in cell lysis, capsid assembly and host integration (int.) are 
labeled.
(B) Representative colony pictures of Lmo 10403s ϕcure strains constitutively expressing 
“fragment 1” (as shown in (A)) or the indicated individual genes from ϕJ0161a transformed 
with pNT or pT. The rightmost panels show a 10403s lysogen of ϕJ0161a with CRISPR-
Cas9 inhibitor genes deleted (::ϕJ0161aΔacrIIA1-2). See Figure S2 for data from the other 
ϕJ0161a fragments and Figure S2/S3 for full plates.
(C) Representative colony pictures of Lmo 10403s ϕcure strains constitutively expressing 
acrIIA3, acrIIA4, or orfD transformed with pNT or pT.

 Figure 4. Genomic organization and prevalence of acrIIA genes
(A) The genomic context of acrIIA1 (1) and its homolog from L. monocytogenes (orfD) are 
depicted to scale as cartoons with acrIIA1 homologs in vertical alignment. Typically, acrIIA 
genes are encoded within prophages adjacent to or near the phage lysin (ply) gene. Genomic 
neighbors of acrIIA1 and orfD (acrIIA1-4, orfA-E) are shown. Individual genes (***) were 
assayed for CRISPR-Cas9 inhibition in L. monocytogenes 10403s (see Figure 3 and Figure 
S3). Helix-turn-helix (HTH) and AP2 DNA binding motifs were detected in some proteins 
using hidden markov model (HMM) prediction software (Söding et al., 2005).
(B) Pie-graph representation of the frequency of each acrIIA gene co-occurrences
(C) Pie-graph representation of the prevalence of acrIIA and cas9 genes in the L. 
monocytogenes pangenome. See Table S1 for relevant accession numbers.

 Figure 6. Inhibition of Streptococcus pyogenes dCas9 and Cas9
(A) A schematic outlining the experimental setup, where single-cell fluorescence of E. coli 
BW25113 expressing Streptococcus pyogenes (Spy) dCas9 and a sgRNA targeted towards a 
chromosomal red fluorescent protein (RFP) gene was measured by flow cytometry.
(B) Candidate (orf) and validated (acr) acrIIA genes were tested for their ability to inhibit 
dCas9-based gene repression. Measurements taken reflect the median RFP fluorescence 
value of a single cell in a unimodal population normalized for each candidate gene to a 
sgRNA-free control. Error bars represent the mean +/− SD of at least three biological 
replicates. See Figure 3 and Figure S3 for gene-identification information. See Figure S4 for 
raw flow cytometry data.
(C) A schematic outlining the experimental setup, where HEK293T cells with a 
chromosomally-integrated, doxycycline-inducible eGFP cassette were transfected with a 
plasmid encoding a single transcript tracrRNA/eGFP-targeting sgRNA and NLS-SpyCas9 
alongside expression constructs encoding one of five codon-optimized phage genes at 
different ratios. The percent of eGFP positive cells was measured 12 hours after induction by 
flow cytometry.
(D) Candidate (orf) and validated (acr) acrIIA genes were tested for their ability to inhibit 
dCas9-based gene editing. An increasing amount of inhibitor plasmid (in ng) was added 
from left to right, at a ratio to the Cas9/sgRNA plasmid of 1:1 and 3:1. Data were
