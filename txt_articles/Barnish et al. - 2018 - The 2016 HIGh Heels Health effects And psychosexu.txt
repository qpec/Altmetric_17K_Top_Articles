The 2016 HIGh Heels: Health effects And
psychosexual BenefITS (HIGH HABITS)
study: systematic review of reviews and
additional primary studies
Max Barnish1*, Heather May Morgan2,3 and Jean Barnish4
Abstract
Background: High-heeled shoes (high heels) are frequently worn by many women and form an important part of
female gender identity. Issues of explicit and implicit compulsion to wear high heels have been noted. Previous
studies and reviews have provided evidence that high heels are detrimental to health. However, the evidence base
remains fragmented and no review has covered both the epidemiological and biomechanical literature. In addition,
no review has considered the psychosexual benefits that offer essential context in understanding the public health
challenge of high heels.
Methods: We searched seven major bibliographic databases up to November 2016, in addition to supplementary
searches. We initially identified all review articles of any design that assessed either the psychosexual benefits or
negative musculoskeletal health effects of high heels, the latter looking at both the epidemiological and
biomechanical perspectives. We additionally considered additional primary studies on areas that had not been
reviewed before or in which a marked lack of evidence had been noted. Data were extracted onto standardised
forms. Proportionate second review was conducted.
Results: A total of 506 unique records were identified, 27 full-text publications were screened and 20 publications
(7 reviews and 13 additional studies) were included in our evidence synthesis. The most up-to-date epidemiological
review provides clear evidence of an association between high heel wear and hallux valgus, musculoskeletal pain
and first-party injury. The body of biomechanical reviews provides clear evidence of changes indicative of increased
risk of these outcomes, as well as osteoarthritis, which is not yet evidenced by epidemiological studies. There were
no reviews on psychosexual benefits, but all five identified original studies provided evidence of increased
attractiveness and/or an impact on men’s behaviour associated with high heel wear. With regard to second-party
injury, evidence is limited to one descriptive study and eight case reports.
Conclusions: Our evidence synthesis clearly shows that high heels bring psychosexual benefits to women but are
detrimental to their health. In light of this dilemma, it is important that women’s freedom of choice is respected
and that any remaining issues of explicit or implicit compulsion are addressed.

 Background
Cultural and policy context
High-heeled shoes (high heels) are a form of footwear that
raises the heels of the wearer’s foot substantially above the
level of the toes, making the wearer taller. They have a
long history in human civilisation [1]. An earlier form of
high heels were worn by men in the medieval period,
when their function was largely practical, that is to say to
raise the wearer above the filth of medieval streets [2]. In
modern society, high heels have become a fashionable
symbol of modern (heteronormative) female sexuality [3],
and are regularly worn by a considerable proportion of
women [4]. Fashion operates by capitalizing on concepts
of social compliance and conformity [5, 6], potentially
mediated through celebrity influence [7, 8] and the ex-
pectation to perform normalised gender roles [9, 10].
Many feminist theorists have argued that gendered vio-
lence occurs when women become disabled by their cloth-
ing and footwear [11], when standards of beauty define
dimensions of physical freedom [12, 13].
Although many women like wearing high heels for
various reasons, this cultural context raises the possibil-
ity of some women wearing high heels when they have
not chosen freely to do so. One online opinion poll esti-
mates that the proportion of women whose high heel
wear is mainly due to social expectation rather than
their own free choice may be around a third [14]. This
would represent a substantial minority, and is around
the same as the proportion this poll reports have ever
been required to wear high heels at work.
Moreover, political features and approaches have been
shown to be an important determinant of population-level
health outcomes [15]. One way in which such influences
may operate is through the extent to which a government
decides to intervene in societal matters. One major policy
controversy in some localities recently has been whether
employers are legally allowed to, or indeed should be
allowed to, stipulate that female staff wear high heels to
work. In the United Kingdom, the Government has pub-
lished a response [16] stating that it will work to develop
guidelines and raise awareness of this issue, as others have
also done, to ensure women are not discriminated against
in the workplace. Nevertheless, there has been some
media confusion about the details of this response and
some commentators have criticised the decision to rely on
the Equality Act (2010) rather than propose new legisla-
tion. In comparison, the Canadian province of British
Columbia has chosen to make an amendment to existing
legislation to specifically prohibit employers from requir-
ing female staff to wear high heels [17]. Current policy
discussions have largely not considered issues relating to
entertainment venue or licensed social event admission
policies, although the policy of the Cannes Film Festival
has been very controversial [18].
Existing evidence
The popular view that wearing high heels increases
women’s attractiveness to men is supported by scientific
evidence [19, 20]. Although this is not a health outcome,
it is socially relevant and may be of interest to the public
health community since it is the tension between psy-
chosexual benefits and negative musculoskeletal (MSK)
health effects that makes high heels a topic of substantial
public health interest and also of interest with regard to
the study of the social determinants of health outcomes.
A large number of studies have been conducted to
examine the relationship between high heels and MSK
health. There are two dominant approaches as discussed
before [21] each with their associated strengths and limi-
tations: the experimental biomechanical approach and
the epidemiological approach. For example, the former
approach provides clearer insight into causality, while
the latter does not rely on proxy markers of clinical
outcomes.
Thorough review articles have been published from
both perspectives. The most recent biomechanical re-
view [22] found evidence of qualitatively consistent alter-
ations to the neuromechanics of walking gait and the
kinetics and kinematics of bodily structures from the
toes to the spine in ways that could be seen as biomech-
anical markers of MSK conditions such as hallux valgus
(HV) and osteoarthritis (OA). This was a narrative non-
systematic review published in 2014 with the most re-
cent included study being published in 2012. Meanwhile,
the most recent epidemiological review found evidence
of an association between high heel wear and MSK pain,
HV and first-party injury. Nevertheless, associations with
OA and second-party injury were inconclusive. This was
a narrative systematic review published in 2016 with a
final search date of July 2015.
Gaps in knowledge and the aims of our systematic review
The evidence base has remained fragmented as no prior
review article has integrated both the epidemiological
and biomechanical perspectives. Moreover, no prior re-
view has considered the psychosexual benefits, which
provide important social context to this important area
of public health debate. Conducting an integrated review
of these perspectives has been identified [21] as a
research priority. Indeed, we were aware of a number of
prior reviews on different aspects of this topic that we
could synthesize. Therefore, we present the first system-
atic review of reviews on high heels. Our review is the
first to consider both the epidemiological and biomech-
anical perspectives on the negative MSK health effects of
high heels. In addition, our review is the first to present
evidence on the psychosexual benefits associated with
high heel wear, thereby providing essential context in
understanding the public health challenge of high heels.

 To further strengthen our evidence synthesis, we added
additional primary studies on areas in which no review
had been conducted or a marked lack of prior research
had been identified.
Methods
Design
The 2016 HIGh Heels: Health effects And psychosexual
BenefITS (HIGH HABITS) study used a systematic re-
view approach following PRISMA [23] as appropriate. In
light of the existence of a number of prior reviews on
aspects of this topic, albeit a stark lack of integration of
different aspects, our systematic review initially sought
to synthesise evidence from available reviews. Subse-
quently, additional primary evidence was added on areas
identified to be lacking in research and/or prior reviews.
The search strategy was designed by MSB (lead reviewer)
and JB, who conducted proportionate quality control on
review procedures. Any discrepancies were resolved by
discussion.
Data sources
MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid), AMED (Ovid),
PsycINFO (Ovid), Cochrane Central (Ovid), CINAHL
(EBSCO) and Web of Science (Thomson Reuters,
excluding patents) were searched up to November
2016. As per Barnish and Barnish [21], we applied
the following keywords to all databases: “positive heel in-
clination”, “high heel”, “high-heeled”,‘“high heeled”, “wedge
heel”, “platform heel”, “platform shoe”, “stiletto” and
“elevator shoe”. The only change we made was to add
quotation marks to increase search specificity. Supple-
mentary searches were conducted in Google Scholar
(GS), Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) and
bibliographies of relevant articles.
Inclusion criteria
We included review studies of any design (non-systematic
review, systematic review or meta-analysis) that were:
� Published as full articles in English, French, German,
Spanish, Italian, Dutch or Portuguese language peer-
reviewed scientific journals
� Provided evidence to associate high heel wear (not
revised high heels or orthotics) with at least one of
psychosexual benefits, or osteoarthritis (OA), hallux
valgus (HV), musculoskeletal (MSK) pain or first- or
second-party injury from either an epidemiological
or biomechanical perspective. Indirect injuries such
as road traffic accidents were not considered, as high
heels and driving safety is a topic that would require
a review in its own right
� Assessed human participants without prior history
of clinically significant MSK conditions or other
serious medical conditions likely to affect outcomes
We also considered individual primary studies that:
� Addressed an aspect on which no review had been
published (which turned out to be the psychosexual
benefits), or addressed second-party injury, which
had been noted [21] to be an area in which research
was particularly lacking
� Used a quantitative design, with the exception of
second-party injury, for which case reports were also
considered due to a prior finding [21] of almost no
prior population-based studies
Data extraction
The following data were extracted for review articles:
� Bibliographic details
� Language of publication
� Review design
� Search date (or if not available, year of last included
publication)

designs.
Results
Search results
Database searches yielded 923 records (MEDLINE 223,
EMBASE 251, AMED 54, PsycINFO 30, Cochrane
Central 12, CINAHL 2 and Web of Science 351), which
yielded 492 unique records following deduplication.
Supplementary searches yielded an additional 14 records
(3% of unique records), providing a grand total of 506
unique records. Ten reviews proceeded to full-text
screening and seven met the inclusion criteria for our

 review – of these, two [21, 24] were systematic reviews
without meta-analysis and five [22, 24–28] were non-
systematic reviews. There were no meta-analyses. All
seven reviews were published in English, although one
[28] was also available in Portuguese. Ninety-six unique
publications were reviewed across these seven review
articles.
Seventeen additional primary publications proceeded
to full-text screening and 13 met the inclusion criteria
for our review, all published in English. Eight publica-
tions [29–36] were case reports of second-party injury
reporting a total of 10 cases from three countries (UK,
Denmark and Ireland). Five publications [19, 20, 37–
39] reported psychosexual studies from three coun-
tries (France, UK and Egypt). There were no further
non-case report studies on second-party injury. All re-
ports were considered separate studies since different
analyses were reported and our approach did not
involve meta-analysis. The article selection process is
shown in Fig.1, study results in Table 1, study charac-
teristics in Table 2 and studies excluded at full-text
review with reasons in Table 3.
Reviews
Two reviews provided epidemiological data. Riskowski et
al. [26] assessing literature up to 2010, did not focus pri-
marily on high heels and only included three studies on
heel height, reaching inconclusive conclusions regarding
pain and OA. Meanwhile, a systematic review by Barnish
and Barnish [21] up to July 2015 demonstrates how the
field has progressed to provide clear evidence that high
heels are associated with MSK pain, HV and first-party
injury, including to children. There remained no clear
epidemiological evidence of a link with OA and second-
party injury. Only one descriptive study [40] had pre-
sented second-party injury data, the toll was relatively
low and these were excluded from further analysis in the
paper by Williams and Haines.
The remaining reviews focused on biomechanical as-
pects. Generally, across reviews, there was good evi-
dence of considerable kinetic and kinematic alterations
associated with high heel wear that can be considered
markers of increased first-party injury risk and MSK
conditions such as OA, HV and MSK pain. Silva et al.
[28] provide valuable insights into postural disorders

Results
Barnish and Barnisha, 2016 [21]
Evidence from 18 studies was included (total sample size 14,647). Six studies (33%) were assessed as
high quality, eight (44%) as moderate quality and four (22%) as low quality. Studies varied in terms
of their populations, ranging from young women to the elderly, while others were whole-population
studies including children. Three out of four studies found that high heels were associated with HV.
Zero out of two studies found an association with OA. Three out of five studies found an association
with MSK pain and this evidence was strengthened when study quality was taken into consideration.
Seven out of eight studies found an association with first-party injury – two of these studies profiled
emergency department presentations and found a considerable proportion of children among
presenting cases. Only one study provided data on second-party injury and the reported injury
toll was low. Generally, this review provides good epidemiological support for the idea that
wearing high heels increases a woman’s risk of suffering MSK ill-health.
Cowley et al., 2009 [25]
Evidence from 38 publications is included. The body of evidence supports the view that high heels
are associated with pain, HV and ankle inversion injuries. The majority of studies found alterations in
foot and ankle kinematics, kinetics, knee and hip flexion, gait, posture and balance. Evidence for spinal
alterations was less conclusive.
Cronin, 2014 [22]
Evidence from 43 publications is included. The body of evidence supports the view that wearing
high heels leads to qualitatively consistent alterations to the neuromechanics of walking gait and the
kinetics and kinematics of bodily structures from the toes to the spine in ways that may be seen as
biomechanical markers of MSK conditions such as HV and OA.
Murley et al.a, 2009 [24]
Evidence from four studies on the effect of heel height was included. Most studies were on young
adults. Generally, there was good evidence of alterations in lower limb and low back muscle activity,
although one study found no significant difference.
Riskowski et al., 2011 [26]
Evidence from three studies on the effect of heel height is included. The single study on OA did not
found an association with high heel wear. One of two studies on pain found an association.
Russell, 2010 [27]
Evidence from nine studies (one only available as a conference abstract) was included (total female
sample size 182). Increased lumbar lordosis (potentially accompanied by increased pelvic tilt) would
be expected to indicate increased risk of low back pain. This result was found in two out of nine
studies, with a trend to an effect in younger female participants in one further study. The author
argues for a disconnect between scientific evidence and Internet content/clinician opinion regarding
the potential role of high heels in low back pain.
Silva et al., 2013 [28]
This could be considered a ‘semi-systematic’ review. Evidence from 20 studies fulfilling inclusion criteria,
and 5 other studies, not fulfilling the criteria but considered useful, was included. This review focused on
adolescents (aged 10 to 19). There was evidence that high heel wear in adolescents can lead to postural
disorders affecting head positioning, the back, pelvis and knee. Heel height and width were identified as
key factors in the emergency of postural changes and body imbalance.
Part B. Results for primary studies on psychosexual benefits associated with wearing high heels
Guéguen, 2015 [20]
Male participants were more likely to answer a survey on gender equality when the female confederate
was wearing high heels than flat shoes (83% vs 47%). The difference between high and medium (63%)
heels approached significance, but the difference between medium and flat was not significant. Male
participants were more likely than female participants to answer a survey on food consumption habits
presented by a female confederate. There was a significant effect of shoe condition for men (flat = 42%,
medium = 60% and high heel = 82%), but not women (flat = 32%, medium = 37%, high = 30%). Male
participants were more likely than female participants to help when a female confederate dropped a
glove – there was a significant effect of shoe condition for men (flat = 62%, medium = 78% and high
heel = 93%) but not for women (flat = 43%, medium = 50% and high 52%). Male participants were
significantly more likely to approach a female confederate in a bar if she was wearing high heels than
either medium (p = 0.02) or flat (p < 0.001) shoes – there was no significant difference between flat and
medium (p = 0.26).
Guéguen and Stefan, 2015 [37]
Male participants were more likely to smile back at a female confederate if she was wearing high
heels (56%) than medium heels (36%, p = 0.04) or flat shoes (30%, p < 0.01) – there was no significant
difference between flat and medium (p = 0.52). Male participants were more likely than female
participants to answer a survey on gender equality presented by a female confederate – there was a
significant effect of shoe condition for men (flat = 48%, medium = 60%, high heel = 82%) but not
women (flat = 42%, medium = 38%, high = 46%). Male participants’ judgements of a photograph of
a young woman presented on a computer screen were influenced with regard to sexiness (p = 0.004),
bust attractiveness (p < 0.001), overall attractiveness (p < 0.001), beauty (p = 0.01), desire to meet
(p = 0.007) and attractiveness to other men (p < 0.01) depending on whether she was wearing flat
shoes or high heels, even though the shoes were not shown in the photograph. There was no statistically
significant effect on buttock attractiveness, probability of being in a couple, academic level, probability of
having a child, expected dating acceptance, youth or age estimation.

 Table 1 Results of included studies (Continued)
Guéguen et al., 2014 [38]
Male participants’ judgements of a photograph of a young women presented on paper were
influenced with regard to sexiness (p < 0.001), prettier legs (p < 0.001), prettier buttocks
(p < 0.001), more elegance (p < 0.001), more good-looking (p < 0.001), youth (p < 0.001), being
selected by others (p < 0.001) and being selected for an album (p < 0.001) depending on whether she
was wearing flat shoes or high heels, even though the shoes were not shown in the photograph. These
effects were all also found at p < 0.001 for female participants’ ratings.
Maarouf, 2015 [38]
When asked whether wearing high heels increased their attractiveness, 64% of surveyed businesswomen
said yes, 27% said maybe and 9% said no. Among ‘worker’ women, 42% said yes, 45% said maybe and
13% said no. Among female university students, 66% said yes, 24% said maybe and 10% said no.
Morris et al., 2013 [19]
When assessing point-light displays of females walking, attractiveness index scores were higher in the
high heel condition than the flat condition (p < 0.001). Female raters assessed the female walkers as
being more attractive than male raters (p < 0.001). There was no statistically significant interaction
between rater gender and shoe condition. Male and female raters were more accurate in correctly
identifying female walkers as female when they were wearing high heels (p < 0.01). In this second
experiment, raters were told there would also be male walkers, although in reality there were no males.

Case description
Ahmed, 1964 [29]
Case 1: 31 year old man struck on the head with a stiletto heel after a fracas in a public house
(a traditional type of bar in the UK). Radiograph revealed a small stellate depressed fracture to left
parietal area with a small scalp laceration. Epileptic and dysphasic symptoms encountered. Patient
recovered from operation and displayed no neurological abnormality at outpatient follow-up in
February 1964, although abnormal EEG activity persisted in the left temporo-parietal area.
Case 2: 36 year old woman struck on the head by another women’s stiletto heel following a street
fight. She suffered aphasia and right hemiplegia, with radiographs showing a depressed fracture in
left parietal parasagittal area. Following operation, a gradual full recovery was experienced.
Cleary et al., 2006 [30]
Case: 16 year old female stepped on by stiletto heel of a fellow dancer on a dance floor. Penetration
of right orbit, presented with headache and right eye pain. Seven months later, although visual acuity
had improved, elevation and abduction were limited, with persisting ptosis. Surgery was planned to
correct ocular position.
Engelhart and Bliddal, 1997 [31]
Case 1: 53 year old woman stepped on by another women’s high heels. Presented to doctor with
oedema and pain, no fracture found on x-ray. Wound gradually healed after 4 months and pain
slowly regressed.
Case 2: 50 year old women stepped on by another women’s high heels. Presented to doctor with
oedema and pain, no fracture found on x-ray but infection suspected. Patient generally healthy at 6
month follow-up.
Fry, 1959 [32]
Case: 14 year old girl stepped on by another girl’s stiletto heel in a bus. Marked tenderness and swelling
to the foot developed 2 days later and the girl could not use her foot. Penicillin was prescribed when
no healing had taken place 10 days after. After five more days, improvement was noticed, but over 5
weeks after the injury, the girl was still having great difficulty walking. The clinician considered the girl
fortunate not to suffer severed tendons.
Jewsbury and Haslett, 2011 [33]
Case: 43 year old woman stamped on the head with a stiletto heel. Presented appearing intoxicated
but denied drinking or illicit drug use. After discharge, re-presented a month later with diplopia and
headaches, mild dysphasia and irritability and ocular motility consistent with acquired Brown’s syndrome.
Scans showed comminuted fracture of left medial orbital roof and cerebral laceration of left frontal lobe.
Joyce and O’Shaughnessy, 2016 [34]
Case: 22 year old woman stood on by another women’s stiletto heel at a bar. Swelling immediately
encountered but minimal pain. On presentation, the hallux was grossly swollen with distal necrosis
of the nailbed and pulp, accompanied by cellulitis. Skin graft operation was performed. Full healing
was encountered.
Missen, 1964 [35]
Case: 54 year old man struck on the head with a stiletto heel by a female relative in a domestic fracas.
Patient fell unconscious but was conscious on presentation to hospital. No neurological abnormalities
were encountered. There was a scalp laceration in the right posterior parietal region. X-ray showed a
deeply depressed bone fragment. An operation revealed a skull defect about 0.75 cm in diameter.
The patient had recovered by discharge date and no further symptoms presented during a 1.5 year
follow-up period.
Stables et al., 2005 [36]
Case: 23 year old man struck on side of head with a stiletto heel. Initially presented with a small
wound and was discharged. He became increasingly unwell and encountered speech difficulties.
Scans revealed minor depressed skull fracture of left parietal bone and underlying contusion of the
parietal lobe. Upon arrival at neurosurgical unit, he presented with mild dysphasia which worsened.
Symptoms presented consistent with cerebritis. Following craniectomy, he improved and the
dysphasia had resolved at 12-month follow-up.

 related to high-heel wear among adolescent girls (aged
10–19). Increased heel height and decreased heel width
were identified as key predictors of negative outcomes.
Looking specifically at lumbar lordosis, considering lit-
erature up to 2010, Russell [27] found inconclusive re-
sults.
Meanwhile,
Cronin
[22]
found
qualitatively
consistent alterations in kinetics and kinematics from
the spine to the toes, although some studies were not
in agreement on lumbar lordosis. More detail on the
findings of each review can be found in Table 1 Part A.
Additional primary studies
There were no prior reviews about the psychosexual
benefits associated with high heel wear. Five studies
addressed this aspect. All five studies presented evi-
dence of such psychosexual benefits. One study from
Egypt [39] assessed women’s own views as to whether
wearing
high
heels
increased
their
attractiveness,
finding
this
effect
among
businesswomen,
female
employees and female university students alike. The
remaining studies assessed judgements of attractive-
ness made by others or influence upon the behaviour
of others. High heels were generally found to have a
much greater effect than medium heels. A series of
studies from France [20, 37, 38] found that attractive-
ness ratings, made by both male and female partici-
pants with regard to a photograph of a woman, were
influenced by high-heel-associated postural changes,
even though her shoes were not visible, whereas
whether or not a man was willing to help a woman
was only influenced by the confederate’s (a person
who participates in a psychological experiment pre-
tending to be a participant but is working for the
researcher) heel height in male participants. Morris et
al. [19] also noted that raters were more likely to mis-
classify a female walking in light-based silhouette form
in a point-light task as male if she was wearing flat
shoes as opposed to high heels. More details on the
findings of the psychosexual studies can be found in
Table 1 Part B.
The only eligible additional studies identified on
second-party injury were case reports [29–36]. Eight
case reports were included, presenting 10 cases. Injuries
requiring emergency department attention were sus-
tained of both deliberate and accidental etiology. Acci-
dental causes were being stepped on by a stiletto heel in
the eye after falling on a dancefloor, two unspecified
cases of being stepped on by stiletto heels, a young girl
suffering foot injury requiring emergency department
attention after being stepped on by a stiletto heel when
someone else was getting off the bus, and a young
woman being stepped on by another woman’s stiletto
heel at a bar. More detail on each case can be found in
Table 1 Part C.
Discussion
Summary of findings
Here we present the first systematic review of reviews
about high heels. We address both the biomechanical
and epidemiological perspectives and offer the first
review of the psychosexual literature, which provides
essential context in which to situate the findings on
negative health effects, and understand the public health
issues and dilemmas they pose for society. The biomech-
anical literature is now clear that wearing high heels
causes substantial kinetic and kinematic alterations in
the MSK system, ranging from the spine to the toes.
These alterations increase the risk of MSK conditions
such as OA, HV and MSK pain as well as first-party
injury. The epidemiological literature also now clearly
says that wearing high heels is associated with increased
risk of HV, MSK pain and first-party injury, although the
risk of first-party injury requiring emergency department
attention is at most moderate. However, there is still no
clear epidemiological evidence of an association between
high heel wear and OA. Therefore, the suggestion from
a large volume of biomechanical evidence dating back to
the seminal paper in the Lancet in 1998 by Kerrigan et
al. [41], that high heel wear may predispose women to
OA has not been confirmed in population-based studies.
Evidence from one observational study [40] and a series
of case reports [29–36] shows that high heels, and in
particular
stilettos,
can
cause
second-party
injuries
requiring emergency department attention. However,
current evidence does not allow a robust quantification
of the magnitude of risk.
Methodological considerations of the topic
The included literature benefits from a large number of
reviews, although only two were systematic reviews.
Compared to non-systematic reviews, systematic reviews
have a more reproducible methodology and are less
prone to selection bias [42]. The strengths and limita-
tions of the epidemiological and biomechanical ap-
proaches have been discussed before [21]. High heel
wear is a very common exposure [4] by epidemiological
standards, being more common than very common
health conditions such as childhood asthma or other
negative health-related behaviours such as smoking [43].
It is challenging to find a truly non-exposed group.
Moreover, studies have tended to focus on relative rather
than absolute risk measures. Moreover, two injury stud-
ies [40, 44] included in the Barnish and Barnish review
[21] used emergency department databases which may
be subject to misclassification and/or underreporting
bias and only provide insight into the extreme end of
the injury spectrum. Meanwhile, psychosexual findings
are limited by a failure to consider platforms and heel
shape as well as an upper heel height bound of 9 cm. No
Barnish et al. BMC Public Health  (2018) 18:37

 study assessed the role of the respective heights of men
and women. This could be relevant since there is a pref-
erence in heterosexual partnerships for the male to be
taller than the female [45, 46], and very high heels may
eliminate
this
difference
since
young
women
in
Australia, the United States and England [47–49] are on
average less than 15 cm shorter than young men. Indeed,
research into this area has a clear heteronormative bias
and does not consider alternative sexualities.
Social context
High heels are a challenging topic due to the tension be-
tween health and psychosexual considerations. The evi-
dence synthesised in our review shows that wearing high
heels increases women’s attractiveness to men and can
reward female wearers with other psychosexual benefits
in terms of male attention and their own view of their
beauty. This poses a potential opportunity or a dilemma,
which many women face regardless of their sexuality.
We hope our review can provide a useful resource for
clinicians such as podiatrists and MSK specialists in
discussing in gender sensitive ways high-heel related
conditions and injuries with which their clients present.
It is important that women’s footwear choices are
respected and that they are not pressurised into wearing
high heels against their will. Unstated social expectation
and pressure, mediated by social compliance [5] and ce-
lebrity influence [7, 8] is clearly a complex challenge that
is difficult to confront. Continuing to raise awareness of
the health issues associated with high heels appears the
most useful solution to seeking to maximise freedom of
choice. Important policy developments have occurred
recently in different localities [16, 17], although chal-
lenges remain regarding compliance with legislation and
also compulsion that occurs beyond the workplace,
which may be covered by equality legislation that refers
to provision of goods and services.
High heels are currently one of the few ‘adult’ items
allowed to be sold to children in countries such as the UK,
and as Silva et al. [28] show us, this can lead to substantial
health issues. Adolescents are particularly prone to peer
pressure [50] and there is evidence that health may play a
limited role in female teenagers’ shoe choices in particular
[51]. Indeed, increased adolescent high heel wear has been
observed in recent years [52]. It has been suggested [53]
that education on their health effects, for example as part
of Personal and Social Education, could be useful. More-
over, it may be worthwhile considering whether it is appro-
priate that high heels can be sold to and for the wear of
people who are still skeletally immature.
Future research directions
Further research is required into OA risk from an epi-
demiological perspective, second-party injury (perceptions
and observations, related to high heels and potentially
other glamorous women’s outfit types) and the competing
influences on women’s freedom of choice in shoe selec-
tion, potentially paralleling Elliott-Green et al. [54]. It is
also important, either from academic studies, or by moni-
toring the media, to assess as time progresses how issues
of compulsion (explicit or implicit) are addressed. More-
over, academics should more frequently take the potential
mediating effects of high heels into account when study-
ing or reviewing the MSK health of female participants.
Strengths and limitations of our review
The key scientific strength of our work is that it brings
together for the first time three hitherto disparate bodies
of evidence – the epidemiological, biomechanical and
psychosexual – on a topic of current social interest.
Moreover, we believe our work is of methodological
value and offers an evidence synthesis approach that we
hope will be of interest to academics working in areas in
which non-systematic reviews remain the predominant
synthesis approach. However, there are certain potential
limitations we should address. Our review was limited to
seven European languages and seven major databases
plus GS and DOAJ, so may not have achieved 100%
coverage of global literature. Also, the speed of scientific
research and communication remains too slow to offer
an effective critique on an ongoing social issue – this
work was inspired by an event that was reported in the
media in May 2016. In addition, the non-inclusion of
grey literature would be considered a limitation by some
academics [55, 56]. Nevertheless, Barnish et al. [57] have
previously argued against the inclusion of grey literature
in certain circumstances, and we believe this is a topic
in which it is most appropriate to focus solely on peer-
reviewed publications, at least at this stage. Risk of bias
assessment could not be conducted in a way that would
offer useful comparability due to a wide range of differ-
ent designs. Therefore, readers should consider their
own biases when evaluating this work.
Conclusion
In this article, we provide the first systematic review of
reviews looking at high heels. We also for the first time
review the psychosexual literature that provides an in-
valuable perspective. We also situate our work in the
context of recent societal debates.
