IMPORTANCE Burnout is prevalent in physicians and can have a negative influence on
performance, career continuation, and patient care. Existing evidence does not allow clear
recommendations for the management of burnout in physicians.
OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effectiveness of interventions to reduce burnout in physicians
and whether different types of interventions (physician-directed or organization-directed
interventions), physician characteristics (length of experience), and health care setting
characteristics (primary or secondary care) were associated with improved effects.
DATA SOURCES MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and Cochrane Register of Controlled
Trials were searched from inception to May 31, 2016. The reference lists of eligible studies and
other relevant systematic reviews were hand searched.
STUDY SELECTION Randomized clinical trials and controlled before-after studies of
interventions targeting burnout in physicians.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Two independent reviewers extracted data and assessed
the risk of bias. The main meta-analysis was followed by a number of prespecified subgroup
and sensitivity analyses. All analyses were performed using random-effects models and
heterogeneity was quantified.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The core outcome was burnout scores focused on
emotional exhaustion, reported as standardized mean differences and their 95% confidence
intervals.
RESULTS Twenty independent comparisons from 19 studies were included in the meta-analysis
(n = 1550 physicians; mean [SD] age, 40.3 [9.5] years; 49% male). Interventions were
associated with small significant reductions in burnout (standardized mean difference
[SMD] = −0.29; 95% CI, −0.42 to −0.16; equal to a drop of 3 points on the emotional exhaustion
domain of the Maslach Burnout Inventory above change in the controls). Subgroup analyses
suggested significantly improved effects for organization-directed interventions
(SMD = −0.45; 95% CI, −0.62 to −0.28) compared with physician-directed interventions
(SMD = −0.18; 95% CI, −0.32 to −0.03). Interventions delivered in experienced physicians
and in primary care were associated with higher effects compared with interventions
delivered in inexperienced physicians and in secondary care, but these differences were not
significant. The results were not influenced by the risk of bias ratings.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Evidence from this meta-analysis suggests that recent
intervention programs for burnout in physicians were associated with small benefits that may
be boosted by adoption of organization-directed approaches. This finding provides support
for the view that burnout is a problem of the whole health care organization, rather than
individuals.

B
urnout is a syndrome consisting of emotional exhaus-
tion, depersonalization, and a diminished sense of
personal accomplishment, which is primarily driven
by workplace stressors.1(pp191-218)2 Burnout is a major concern
for physicians. Nearly half of practicing physicians in the
United States experience burnout at some point in their
career.3 Although there are substantial differences by spe-
cialty, physicians at the front line of care report the highest
rates of burnout.4
Burnout has serious negative consequences for physi-
cians, the health care system, and for patient outcomes. Burn-
out in physicians has been linked with lower work satisfac-
tion, disrupted personal relationships, substance misuse,
depression, and suicide.5,6 Within health care organizations,
burnout is related to reduced productivity, high job turnover,
and early retirement.7-9 Importantly, burnout can result in an
increase in medical errors, reduced quality of patient care, and
lower patient satisfaction.10-15 It is not surprising, therefore,
that wellness of physicians is increasingly proposed as a qual-
ity indicator in health care delivery.16
Leadingdriversofburnoutincludeexcessiveworkload,im-
balance between job demands and skills, a lack of job control,
and prolonged work stress.17 Recently, there has been a shift
from viewing burnout as an individual problem to a problem
of the health care organization as a whole, rooted in issues re-
lated to working environment and organizational culture.18 It
has been suggested that reducing risk of burnout in physi-
cians requires change in organizations, as well as support for
individual physicians.19
Interventions for burnout can be classified into 2 main cat-
egories, physician-directed interventions targeting individu-
alsandorganization-directedinterventionstargetingthework-
ing environment.20,21 Physician-directed interventions
typically involve mindfulness techniques or cognitive behav-
ioraltechniquestoenhancejobcompetenceandimprovecom-
municationskillsandpersonalcopingstrategies.Organization-
directed interventions can involve simple changes in schedule
and reductions in the intensity of workload or more ambi-
tious changes to the operation of practices and whole health
care organizations. These usually involve improved team-
work, changes in work evaluation, supervision to reduce job
demand and enhance job control, and increasing the level of
participation in decision making.
We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of
studies that evaluated interventions to reduce burnout in phy-
sicians.Wedecidedtofocusonburnoutscoresasthemainout-
come of this review because burnout is the best-recognized se-
rious negative consequence of work stress in physicians18,22
and the most commonly reported, and consistently mea-
sured, outcome of work stress interventions.20,21,23 More-
over, by focusing on burnout, we established a level of homo-
geneity in terms of outcomes that allowed us to test our aims
meta-analytically.
Our first objective was to assess the effectiveness of inter-
ventionsinreducingburnout.Second,weexaminedwhattypes
of interventions are the most effective (organization di-
rected, physician directed). Third, we examined whether there
are any differences in the effect of interventions in different
health care settings (primary care, secondary or intensive care)
and in physicians with different levels of working experi-
ence. Our rationale was that physicians working in different
organizational settings or physicians with different levels of
experience might have diverse needs and might respond dif-
ferently to burnout interventions.
Methods
The reporting of the review adheres to the Preferred Report-
ing Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)
statement (eTable 1 in the Supplement).24 The protocol is in-
cluded in eMethods 1 in the Supplement.
Eligibility Criteria
The study population comprised physicians of any specialty
in the primary, secondary, or intensive care setting including
residentsandfellows.Studiesbasedonamixofphysiciansand
other health care professionals were included in the review if
the physicians made up at least 70% of the sample.
Eligible interventions were any intervention designed to
relieve stress and/or improve performance of physicians and
reported burnout outcomes including physician-directed
interventions and organization-directed interventions.
Physician-directed interventions focused on individuals (eg,
cognitive behavioral therapies, mindfulness-based stress
reduction techniques, educational programs for improving
communication skills) whereas organization-directed inter-
ventions introduced changes in the resources, the working
environment, and/or work tasks to decrease stress (eg,
changes in the intensity and/or schedule of the workload or
deeper improvements in the operation of health care organi-
zations and teamwork).
Eligiblecomparisonsincludedanytypeofcontrol(eg,wait-
ing list or no intervention). Outcome was burnout measured
using validated tools such as the Maslach Burnout Inventory
(MBI)1 or other validated measures of burnout. Eligible study
designswerequantitativeinterventiondesignsdescribedinthe
Cochrane handbook including randomized clinical trials, non-
randomized trials, controlled before-after studies, and inter-
rupted time series. Context was any health care setting includ-
ing primary care and secondary care.
Key Points
Question Are interventions for reducing burnout in physicians
effective?
Findings This meta-analysis of 20 controlled interventions on
1550 physicians found that existing interventions were associated
with small and significant reductions in burnout. The strongest
evidence for effectiveness was found for organization-directed
interventions, but these interventions were rare.
Meaning More effective models of interventions are needed to
mitigate risk for burnout in physicians. Such models could be
organization-directed approaches that promote healthy
individual-organization relationships.

Exclusion Criteria
Interventional studies not reporting data on burnout out-
comes but providing data on general stress, well-being, or job
satisfaction were excluded, as was gray literature.
Search Strategy and Data Sources
Five electronic bibliographic databases were searched from
inception until May 31, 2016: MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL,
Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials, and PsycINFO. The
search strategy included combinations of 3 key blocks of
terms (burnout; physicians; interventions) using medical
subject headings (MESH terms) and text words (eMethods 2
in the Supplement). Searches were supplemented by hand
searches of the reference lists of eligible studies and system-
atic reviews.
Study Selection
The results of the searches were exported in Endnote and du-
plicates were removed. Study selection was completed in 2
stages. First, the titles and abstracts of the studies were
screened and subsequently the full texts of relevant studies
were accessed and further screened against the eligibility cri-
teria. The title and abstract screening was undertaken by
M. P., whereas 2 independent reviewers were involved in full-
text screening. Interrater reliability was high (κ = 0.96). Dis-
agreements were resolved through discussions.
Data Extraction
An Excel data extraction form was developed and initially pi-
loted in 5 randomly selected studies. Quantitative data for
meta-analysis were extracted on a separate extraction sheet.
Authors were contacted when data were missing or incom-
plete. The following descriptive information was extracted
from the studies:
• Study: research design, method of recruitment, and content
of control
• Participants: sample size, age, sex, setting and/or specialty,
years of work experience
• Intervention: content, delivery format, intensity, follow-up
time points
• Outcomes: scores in burnout including emotional exhaus-
tion, depersonalization, and professional accomplishment.
Risk of Bias Assessment
The critical appraisal of the studies was performed using the
Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) risk of bias
tool.25 It was chosen because it is appropriate for use across
all types of intervention designs described in the Cochrane
handbook. The EPOC tool contains 9 standardized criteria
scored on a 3-point scale, corresponding to low, unclear, and
high risk.
Data Analysis
Standardized mean differences (SMDs) and associated confi-
denceintervalsfortheburnoutoutcomesofallthestudieswere
calculated in Comprehensive Meta-Analysis.26 The pooled
SMDs and the forest plots were computed using the metaan
command in Stata 14.27 The main meta-analysis evaluated the
effectivenessoftheinterventionsinreducingburnout.TheMBI
measure for burnout provides ratings in 3 domains (emo-
tional exhaustion, depersonalization, and personal accom-
plishment). It is not recommended that they be combined.1 In
line with previous meta-analyses, we used only the emo-
tional exhaustion domain of MBI in the analyses.23 Emo-
tional exhaustion is considered the most central aspect of
burnout (some studies only use this domain), and other uni-
dimensional measures of burnout focus on emotional
exhaustion.23,28 To ease the interpretation of the results we
“back-transformed” the pooled SMD to a mean difference for
the emotional exhaustion subscale, under certain assump-
tions. When data were available for more than 1 follow-up as-
sessment point, the short-term assessment points were in-
serted in the main analysis. Three prespecified subgroup
analyses29 were carried out:
1. Type of interventions—we tested the effectiveness of phy-
sician-directed and organization-directed interventions.
2. Working experience of physicians—we examined the differ-
ential treatment effects across studies that recruited phy-
sicianswithextensiveworkingexperience(meanof≥5years)
and studies that recruited physicians with low experience
(mean of <5 years). All studies classified into the low-
experience category explicitly reported in the Methods that
they recruited junior physicians.
3. Health care setting—we tested the effects of interventions
separately in physicians based in primary care and in sec-
ondary care.
Two sensitivity analyses were performed. We examined
the effects of interventions on the other 2 domains of MBI
(depersonalization and personal accomplishment). We also
examined whether effects were robust when only studies with
low risk of bias scores were retained in the analyses.
Heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistic. Conven-
tionally, I2 values of 25%, 50%, and 75% indicate low, moder-
ate, and high heterogeneity.30 All analyses were conducted
using a random-effects model, even if I2 was low. Random-
effects models are more conservative and have better prop-
erties in the presence of any heterogeneity.31,32 The Cohen Q
test of between-group variance was used to test whether the
effectiveness of burnout interventions is significantly differ-
ent across subgroups. Cluster randomized clinical trials were
identifiedandtheprecisionofanalysesadjustedusingasample
size/variation inflation method, assuming an intraclass cor-
relation of 0.02. Provided that we identified 10 or more
studies,33 we aimed to use funnel plots and the Egger test to
assess small-sample bias (an indicator of possible publication
bias).34 Funnel plots were constructed using the metafunnel
command,35 and the Egger test was computed using the meta-
bias command.36
Results
As shown in Figure 1, the search strategy yielded 2322 ar-
ticles. Following the removal of duplicates, 1723 articles were
retained for title and abstract screening. Of these, 75 were rel-
evant for full-text screening and 19 studies were included in

the review.37-55 One study included a lower percentage of
physicians (67%), but we retained it in the analyses to maxi-
mize the evidence base.39
Characteristics of Studies and Physicians
The Table presents the characteristics of the 19 studies (in-
cluding20independentcomparisonson1550physicians;mean
[SD] age, 40.3 [9.5] years). Eight studies were conducted in the
United States (42%), 4 in Europe, 3 in Australia, 2 in Canada, 1
in Argentina, and 1 in Israel. An equal proportion of men and
women were recruited in the majority of studies.
Sevenstudiesrecruitedphysiciansworkinginprimarycare
(mostly labeled “general practitioners”), 10 studies recruited
physicians in secondary care (eg, physicians in intensive care
units, oncologists, and surgeons), and 2 studies recruited a
mixed sample of physicians through their registration in na-
tional medical associations. Across all interventions, the main
eligibility criteria were being a physician (working in a spe-
cific setting in most cases) and willingness to take part in the
study.Noneofthestudiesspecificallytargetedphysicianswith
certain severity levels of burnout. The majority of studies
(n = 12 [67%]) were based on experienced physicians (mean
working experience of ≥5 years) whereas 7 studies were based
on recently qualified physicians (mean working experience of
<5 years). With the exception of 1 study,37 all used the MBI to
assess the severity of burnout (eTable 2 in the Supplement).
Characteristics of Interventions
Interventions varied considerably in their characteristics
including content, duration/intensity, and length of post-
intervention assessment points (see Table). The majority
(n = 12 [60%]) were physician-directed interventions that
comprised mindfulness-based stress reduction techniques,
educational interventions targeting physicians’ self-
confidence and communication skills, exercise, or a combi-
nation of these features.
Within the category of organization-directed interven-
tions, 5 studies evaluated simple workload interventions that
focused on rescheduling hourly shifts and reducing work-
load. Only 3 studies tested more extensive organization-
directed interventions incorporating discussion meetings to
enhanceteamworkandleadership,structuralchanges,andele-
mentsofphysicianinterventionssuchascommunicationskills
training and mindfulness.
The duration of the interventions ranged from 2 weeks to
9 months. Follow-up assessment points ranged from 1 day to
18 months after the intervention. All interventions were de-
livered in face-to-face format.
Risk of Bias Characteristics
The results of the risk of bias assessment are presented in eFig-
ure 1 in the Supplement. Eighteen comparisons were random-
ized clinical trials (95%) whereas 2 were controlled before-
and-after studies. Fifteen comparisons (75%) fulfilled 6 of the
9 risk of bias criteria (a higher score indicates lower vulner-
ability to bias). Three comparisons fulfilled 8 or 9 criteria (17%)
while 5 fulfilled 4 or fewer criteria (25%); most moderately ac-
counted for the risk of bias criteria.
Main Meta-Analysis: Effectiveness of Interventions
in Reducing Burnout
Interventions were associated with small, significant reduc-
tions in burnout (SMD = −0.29; 95% CI, −0.42 to −0.16;
I2 = 30%; 95% CI, 0 to 60%) (Figure 2). The back-transformed
emotional exhaustion score for the intervention group was 15.1
(95% CI, 13.9 to 16.5), compared with a control group score of
17.9 and assuming a standard deviation of 8.97 for the effect.
Subgroup Analyses
Types of Interventions
Physician-directed interventions were associated with small
significant reductions in burnout (SMD = −0.18; 95% CI, −0.32
to −0.03; I2 = 11%; 95% CI, 0 to 49%; back-transformed emo-
tional exhaustion score = 16.2; 95% CI, 14.7 to 17.3 compared
with a control group score of 17.9) whereas organization-
directed interventions were associated with medium signifi-
cant reductions in burnout (SMD = −0.45; 95% CI, −0.62 to
−0.28; I2 = 8%; 95% CI, 0 to 60%; back-transformed emo-
tional exhaustion score = 13.9; 95% CI, 12.4 to 14.7 compared
with a control group score of 17.9) (Figure 3). The effects of
organization-directed interventions were significantly larger
than the effects of physician-directed interventions (Cohen
Q = 4.15, P = .04).
Working Experience
The pooled effect of interventions on burnout scores was
medium and significant across studies mainly based on expe-
rienced physicians (SMD = −0.37; 95% CI, −0.58 to −0.16;

session focused on mindfulness. Participants were
encouraged to focus their attention on the present moment
and to observe their own thoughts, feelings, and behavior
in a nonjudgmental way. Some of the themes discussed
were awareness of pleasant or unpleasant sensations,
feelings, or thoughts; perceptual biases and filters;
burnout; boundaries or conflict management; and self-care.

control group score of 17.9) and small and significant across
studies on physicians with limited experience (SMD = −0.27;
95% CI, −0.40 to −0.14; I2 = 0%; 95% CI, 0 to 75%; back-
transformed emotional exhaustion score = 15.5; 95% CI, 13.8
to 16.9 compared with a control group score of 17.9) (eFigure
2 in the Supplement). This group difference was nonsignifi-
cant (Q = 0.92, P = .34).
Health Care Setting
Interventionsinprimarycarewereassociatedwithsmalltome-
dium reductions in burnout (SMD = −0.39; 95% CI, −0.59 to
−0.19; I2 = 4%; 95% CI, 0 to 69%; back-transformed emo-
tional exhaustion score = 14.4; 95% CI, 12.6 to 16.2 compared
with a control group score of 17.9). Interventions in second-
ary care were associated with small significant reductions in
burnout (SMD = −0.24; 95% CI, −0.41 to −0.07; I2 = 41%; 95%
CI, 0 to 65%; back-transformed emotional exhaustion
score = 15.7; 95% CI, 13.9 to 17.4 compared with a control group
score of 17.9) (eFigure 3 in the Supplement). This difference
was nonsignificant (Q = 0.51, P = .48).
Sensitivity Analyses
The treatment effect derived by studies at lower risk of bias
(ie, scoring low on 6 of the 9 risk of bias criteria) was similar
to the overall effects of the main analysis (SMD = −0.32; 95%
CI, −0.49 to −0.14; I2 = 42%; 95% CI, 0 to 70%) (eFigure 4 in
the Supplement).
Interventions were associated with very small significant
reductions in depersonalization (SMD = −0.21; 95% CI, −0.35
to −0.06; I2 = 33%; 95% CI, 0 to 68%) (eFigure 5 in the Supple-
ment) and small improvements in personal accomplishment
(SMD = 0.30; 95% CI, 0.15 to 0.45; I2 = 0; 95% CI, 0 to 58%)
(eFigure 6 in the Supplement). The subgroup analyses in these
2 domains showed similar results but were based on a smaller
number of studies (eTable 3 in the Supplement).
Small-Study Bias
We found no evidence of funnel plot asymmetry, which might
indicate publication bias for the main, or subgroup analyses
(Egger test P = .11 for main analysis) (Figure 4).
Discussion
Summary of Main Findings
This meta-analysis showed that interventions for physicians
were associated with small significant reductions in burnout.
Organization-directed interventions were associated with
higher treatment effects compared with physician-directed in-
terventions. Interventions targeting experienced physicians
and delivered in primary care showed evidence of greater ef-
fectiveness compared with interventions targeting less expe-
rienced physicians and delivered in secondary care, but these
group differences were nonsignificant.
Strengths and Limitations
This is a comprehensive meta-analysis of controlled interven-
tions aimed at reducing physician burnout. The 2 greatest
threats to the validity of meta-analysis are heterogeneity and
publication bias. However, the biggest strength of this work

is the large number of identified and meta-analyzed con-
trolledcomparisons(20,whenapproximately11.5%ofallmeta-
analyses include ≥10 studies), which allows us to reliably es-
timate and model heterogeneity levels.57 In addition, the size
of the meta-analysis allowed us to assess publication bias with
adequate power.33 Although publication bias tests are rarely
conclusive, we did not observe any bias indications in the plot
or test.
The included studies differed significantly in terms of
content of interventions, study design and/or quality, and
length of follow-up that limit the extent to which broad con-
clusions can be drawn about the overall effectiveness of phy-
sician interventions. However, estimates of heterogeneity in
the pooled analyses were low to moderate by conventional
thresholds and random-effects models were applied in all
analyses.58 Heterogeneity was further addressed by conduct-
ing prespecified subgroup analyses (within the limits of
power).59 While this is a useful approach for producing guid-
ance to design and deliver the most effective interventions,
subgroup analyses should be interpreted cautiously because
other, uncontrolled differences between studies might
account for the results.60,61
Comparison With Previous Systematic Reviews
Three existing systematic reviews have examined the effec-
tiveness of work stress interventions in health care profes-
sionals, with only 1 of these specifically focused on
physicians.21,62,63 Our findings regarding the overall effec-
tiveness of burnout interventions and the increased effec-
tiveness of organizational interventions are in agreement
with the most recent meta-analysis on physician burnout.63
In comparison, we narrowed our attention to controlled
interventions and we undertook additional evidence-based
prespecified subgroup analyses to examine whether the
characteristics of interventions, physicians, and health care
settings influenced the overall effect of burnout interven-
tions. This decision was based on the recognition that con-
trolled interventions offer the best opportunity to reach rig-
orous conclusions about the effectiveness of the tested
interventions and that intervention studies on physician
burnout are highly heterogeneous. This approach enabled us
to draw informative conclusions regarding the effectiveness
of burnout interventions among physicians that take into
account the influence of the distinct features of interven-
tions, physicians, and health care settings.

Implications for Researchers, Clinicians, and Policymakers
Eventhoughmanystudieshaveexaminedriskfactorsforburn-
out in physicians, relatively few intervention programs have
been developed and evaluated. Our main finding is that the
treatment effects were significant but small, equal to a 3-point
reduction in the emotional exhaustion domain of the MBI. At
present, the low quality of the research evidence does not al-
low firm practical recommendations, but we offer some in-
sights for research and clinical directions.
Organization-directed interventions were more likely to
lead to reductions in burnout, but there were large variations
in terms of actual approaches, intervention ingredients, and
intensity. Those that combined several elements such as struc-
tural changes, fostering communication between members of
the health care team, and cultivating a sense of teamwork and
job control tended to be the most effective in reducing
burnout.45 However, such intense organization-directed in-
terventions were rare and were not evaluated widely. The ma-
jority of organization-directed interventions that we in-
cluded in the analyses introduced simple reductions in the
workload or schedule changes. Concerns about implementa-
tion and delivery costs of organization-directed interven-
tions, especially if they involve complex and major health care
system changes, might explain their scarcity.20,64 A recent ex-
ample promoting healthy individual-organization relation-
ships is the Listen-Act-Develop model implemented in Mayo
Clinic.65 Large-scale cluster-randomized trials of such pro-
grams at the institutional or even at the national level that em-
phasize organizational culture by creating a safe space for staff
to acknowledge and decrease stress are possibly an optimal
framework for mitigating burnout.
Physician-directed interventions led to very small signifi-
cantreductionsinburnout.Wefoundnoevidencethatthecon-
tent (eg, mindfulness, communicational, educational compo-
nents) or intensity of these interventions might increase the
derived benefits based on our critical review. This finding, in
combination with the larger effects of organization-directed
interventions, supports the argument that burnout is rooted
in the organizational coherence of the health care system.19,66
If burnout is a problem of whole health care systems, it is less
likely to be effectively minimized by solely intervening at the
individual level. It requires an organization-embedded
approach.19 Moreover, physicians expected to deal with burn-
out individually and remotely from their practicing organiza-
tion might view physician-directed interventions as a per-
sonal responsibility (or blame themselves for being less
“resilient”) rather than as a shared resource to create a flour-
ishing health care environment.65,67 There is some evidence
that elements of the physician-directed interventions (eg,
mindfulness) are effective when supported by organizational
approaches.23,55However,otherunexaminedfactorsatthepro-
cessoftheinterventiondeliveryorattheparticipantlevelmight
account for the observed differences in the effectiveness of or-
ganization-directed and physician-directed interventions. Re-
search programs to understand the best context for the deliv-
ery, evaluation, and implementation of burnout interventions
are required.68-70
Physicians based in different health care settings or at dif-
ferent stages of their career might face unique challenges and
have different needs. We found smaller benefits for recently
qualified and secondary care physicians. The evidence indi-
cates that young physicians are at higher risk for burnout com-
pared with experienced physicians,4 so future research should
focus on prevention among less experienced physicians. In-
terventions focused on enhancing teamwork, mentoring, and
leadership skills might be particularly suitable for young phy-
sicians and for physicians dealing with intense work and pa-
tients with complex care needs.71-73
Conclusions
This meta-analysis found that physicians could gain impor-
tant benefits from interventions to reduce burnout, especially
from organization-directed interventions. However, this evi-
dence is derived from interventions developed and evaluated
in diverse groups of physicians and health care settings. Burn-
out is associated with serious risks to both physicians and pa-
tients; thus, it is imperative that physicians have access to evi-
dence-based interventions that reduce the risk for burnout.
