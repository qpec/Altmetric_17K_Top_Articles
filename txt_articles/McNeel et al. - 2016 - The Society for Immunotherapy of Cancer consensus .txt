Abstract
Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy and second leading cause of cancer death among
men in the United States. In recent years, several new agents, including cancer immunotherapies, have been
approved or are currently being investigated in late-stage clinical trials for the management of advanced prostate
cancer. Therefore, the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) convened a multidisciplinary panel, including
physicians, nurses, and patient advocates, to develop consensus recommendations for the clinical application of
immunotherapy for prostate cancer patients. To do so, a systematic literature search was performed to identify
high-impact papers from 2006 until 2014 and was further supplemented with literature provided by the panel.
Results from the consensus panel voting and discussion as well as the literature review were used to rate
supporting evidence and generate recommendations for the use of immunotherapy in prostate cancer patients.
Sipuleucel-T, an autologous dendritic cell vaccine, is the first and currently only immunotherapeutic agent approved
for the clinical management of metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). The consensus panel utilized
this model to discuss immunotherapy in the treatment of prostate cancer, issues related to patient selection,
monitoring of patients during and post treatment, and sequence/combination with other anti-cancer treatments.
Potential immunotherapies emerging from late-stage clinical trials are also discussed. As immunotherapy evolves as
a therapeutic option for the treatment of prostate cancer, these recommendations will be updated accordingly.

Introduction
Prostate cancer remains the most commonly diagnosed
malignancy in men in the United States. Despite recent
decreases in screening, it is estimated that approximately
180,890 new cases will be diagnosed in 2016, accounting
for 21% of newly diagnosed cancer in men [1]. Moreover,
approximately 27,540 men were estimated to have died
of prostate cancer in 2015, the second leading cause of
cancer death among men in the United States [2]. Early
detection rates combined with an indolent disease
course likely account for the high 5-year survival rates
approaching 100% for newly diagnosed localized (stage I
and II) or regional (stage III) disease. However, approxi-
mately one-third of early stage patients will develop re-
currence, often with metastatic disease. For patients with
metastatic (stage IV) disease 5-year survival rates de-
crease to 28% [2, 3].
Prostate cancer has a very heterogeneous natural
history. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is the
mainstay of initial therapy for metastatic disease. Although
prostate cancer usually initially responds to ADT, resist-
ance eventually develops in nearly all men and the disease
progresses to a state known as mCRPC. In the past 6
years, a number of therapies have been approved for
mCRPC, including androgen signaling inhibitors (enzalu-
tamide, abiraterone acetate) [4–6], cytotoxic chemother-
apy (cabazitaxel) [7], a radiopharmaceutical (radium-223)
[8], and immunotherapy (sipuleucel-T) [9–11]. The timing

 of initiation of treatment as well as the optimal se-
quence of these therapies has been the topic of consid-
erable discussion and debate. Figure 1 demonstrates the
current algorithm for therapy of all stages of prostate
cancer. As can be noted, immunotherapy is currently
employed in the setting of asymptomatic mCRPC.
There has been interest in using immunotherapy as a
treatment for prostate cancer for many years. While the
immunogenicity of prostate tumors was contested nearly
30 years ago, more recent evidence suggests prostate
cancer is an immunologically recognized disease. T cell
infiltration into prostate tumors has been identified at
the time of cancer diagnosis and can be modulated by
treatments such as ADT [12–14]. Cellular and humoral
immune responses can be detected to prostate-specific
and prostate cancer-associated proteins in patients with
prostate cancer [15, 16]. Moreover, the findings of de-
creased MHC class I expression on advanced prostate
tumors and defects in T cell signaling in patients with
advanced disease serve as evidence that prostate cancers
can progress by circumventing T cell immune surveil-
lance [17, 18]. For these reasons, and given that the
prostate is an expendable organ and many tissue-specific
proteins are already known, there has been much explor-
ation of prostate-specific proteins as tumor vaccine
antigens [19, 20]. In addition to dendritic cell-based vac-
cines, including sipuleucel-T, other vaccine strategies
that have been evaluated include the use of whole tumor
cells (GVAX) [21], recombinant viral vectors (PSA-TRI-
COM, PROSTVAC) [22], DNA (pTVG-HP) [23, 24],
and purified proteins or peptides. Additional immuno-
therapy strategies in clinical trials in metastatic prostate
cancer include the evaluation of checkpoint inhibitors
to enhance activation of anti-tumor T cell response
[21, 25–27]. Among the agents currently in clinical trials
are those directed against cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associ-
ated protein-4 (CTLA-4), programmed cell death 1 (PD-1)
and its ligands, and lymphocyte activation gene-3 (LAG-3).
Sipuleucel-T is currently the only approved immuno-
therapy approach for mCRPC and was shown to pro-
duce a survival advantage compared to placebo in a
pivotal phase III randomized, placebo-controlled clinical
trial. Consistent survival findings were also reported in
two smaller randomized placebo controlled studies that
were not powered for overall survival (OS) as the pri-
mary end point [9–11, 28]. It is a cancer vaccine derived
from a recombinant fusion protein of prostatic acid
phosphatase (PAP) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-
stimulating factor (GM-CSF) that is used to activate
autologous antigen-presenting cells (APCs) [19]. Treat-
ment with vaccines, such as sipuleucel-T, is thought to in-
duce tumor-specific immune responses and long-surviving
memory T cells that potentially may continue to have anti-
tumor effects long after it is administered [19, 20].

 Other organizations, both U.S.-based and international,
have developed guidelines concerning the clinical manage-
ment of prostate cancer. Sipuleucel-T is currently the only
immunotherapeutic agent approved by the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines
Agency (EMA) for prostate cancer. Thus, the National
Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), American Uro-
logical Association (AUA), American Society of Clinical On-
cology (ASCO), and European Association of Urology
(EAU) discuss sipuleucel-T as a treatment option for pa-
tients with mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic mCRCP
and provide details of its approval based on improvement in
OS [29–32]. However, due to differences in the international
healthcare funding structure, guidance from the National In-
stitute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) does not rec-
ommend its use based on its incremental cost-effectiveness
ration (ICER) vs. best standard care [33]. Although there is
guidance for its use based on its approved indication, there
is no consensus provided on sequencing with other therap-
ies, monitoring response during treatment, and determining
when to begin subsequent treatment. Thus, this consensus
statement was developed to provide consensuses where
current guidance is lacking for cancer immunotherapy
agents, specifically for sipuleceul-T in this iteration. In
addition, these guidelines provide information on future per-
spectives such as combination approaches and other im-
munotherapy agents in development, with plans to update
these
recommendations
as
further
immunotherapeutic
agents become approved in this disease setting.
SITC is a non-profit organization dedicated to advan-
cing the science and application of cancer immunotherapy
with the goal to improve outcomes for people with cancer.
In order to provide guidance for practicing clinicians,
SITC has established disease-specific panels to address the
application of immunotherapy in the clinical setting and
generate consensus guidelines. The Prostate Cancer Im-
munotherapy Guidelines panel, consisting of U.S. based
physicians, nurses, and patient advocates, met in October
2014 to address the currently approved as well as emer-
ging immunotherapies for prostate cancer. The discussion
of this panel meeting focused on issues related to patient
selection, monitoring of patients during and after treat-
ment, sequencing of treatment with other available ther-
apies, and any special issues for consideration, with the
goal to generate a consensus statement on the clinical use
of immunotherapy for prostate cancer patients. Moreover,
a systematic literature search and review was performed
to identify and evaluate the current evidence concerning
the role of immunotherapy for prostate cancer. The over-
all goal of this consensus paper is to provide guidance for
the clinical application of immunotherapy in prostate can-
cer patients and to provide the foundation to include fu-
ture
therapies
with
updates
to
these
guidelines as
warranted in an ever-changing therapeutic landscape.
Methods
Consensus statement policy
This consensus statement was prepared using the Institute
of Medicine’s March 2011 Standards for Developing Trust-
worthy Clinical Practice Guidelines [34]. In addition, the
previously released SITC consensus guidelines were used as
a model to develop and organize this manuscript as previ-
ously described [35]. To develop these guidelines, SITC
convened a panel led by a steering committee of prostate
cancer experts to meet in October 2014 with the goal to de-
velop clinical treatment guidelines for immunotherapy in
prostate cancer patients. This consensus statement is only
intended to provide guidance. It is not to be used as a sub-
stitute for the individual professional judgment of the treat-
ing physician. The full version of this consensus report and
others can be found on the SITC website [36]. Because of
differences in drug approval, availability, and regulations in
other countries, the panel focused on drugs currently ap-
proved by U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for
the treatment of patients in the United States. Given this,
the consensus panel was U.S. based, and discussion focused
on issues related to U.S. based clinical practice.
Consensus panel and conflicts of interest
Following the methods used for the previous SITC con-
sensus guidelines, panel members were both SITC mem-
bers and nonmembers consisting of multidisciplinary
experts encompassing clinicians and populations expected
to be affected by the development of recommendations.
All panel members were required to disclose any conflicts
of interest using the SITC disclosure form, which requires
full financial and other disclosures concerning relation-
ships with commercial entities that could be expected to
have direct regulatory or commercial impact resulting
from the publication of this statement. No commercial
funding was provided to support the consensus panel, lit-
erature review, or the preparation of this manuscript.
The consensus panel, consisting of 21 participants, in-
cluding 14 medical oncologists, 3 urologists, 1 FDA
physician-representative, 1 expert in translational research,
1 urologic oncology nurse, and 1 patient advocate, met in
October 2014 (Additional file 1). In this meeting, results
were reviewed from a previously distributed questionnaire
to collect information regarding the panel member’s role in
the care of prostate cancer patients, primary clinical focus,
experience with FDA-approved agents for prostate cancer,
and current practices for the use or recommended use of
such agents (Additional file 2). The final version of this
consensus statement was posted for an open comment
period to the entire SITC membership (Additional file 3).
Literature review
The MEDLINE database was used to perform the litera-
ture search using the terms “sipuleucel-T,” “prostate
McNeel et al. Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer  (2016) 4:92 
Page 3 of 12
 cancer and ipilimumab,” “prostate cancer and vaccine,”
“prostate cancer and immunotherapy,” and “prostate cancer
and therapeutic vaccine.” The search was limited to include
clinical trials, meta-analyses, practice guidelines, and research
in humans. The search, conducted on September 29, 2014,
encompassed articles published 2006–2014. Phase I and
phase I/II trials, as well as review articles, were excluded
from the literature search. However, key early reports, meta-
analyses, and guideline reports entered the panel discussion.
After removing duplicates, reviewing the references for ac-
curacy, and supplementing with additional references as
identified by the consensus panel a 34-item bibliography was
finalized (Additional file 4). Using the previously established
grading system [28], the supporting literature was graded
into three levels. To summarize, Level A was defined as
strong, evidence-based data derived from prospective, ran-
domized clinical trials and meta-analyses. Level B literature
consisted of moderately supported data from uncontrolled,
prospective clinical trials. Level C represented weak support-
ing data derived from reviews and case reports.
Consensus recommendations
Immunotherapy for non-mCRPC
Is there a role for the use of FDA-approved immunotherapy
in patients with prostate cancer with non-metastatic,
non-castrate disease?
There was uniformity of opinion that there is no FDA-
approved immunotherapy agent for patients with prostate
cancer without metastases, whether castration-sensitive or
castration-resistant. Similarly, there was uniformity of opinion
that the only immunotherapy agent currently approved by
the FDA for the treatment of prostate cancer is sipuleucel-T,
which is indicated for patients with asymptomatic or minim-
ally symptomatic mCRPC. Considerable discussion ensued,
however, regarding the potential for immunotherapy in an
earlier patient disease setting in which immune responsive-
ness may be greater. It was generally believed that clinical tri-
als of immunotherapy should be pursued in earlier disease
states with appropriate immune monitoring.
Literature review and analysis
Sipuleucel-T is approved for mCRPC, and it is note-
worthy that it is used in asymptomatic or minimally
symptomatic patients where there was a survival benefit
compared to the control group. Furthermore, additional
retrospective analysis reported an association with a
lower baseline serum PSA at the start of treatment with
greater OS benefit from sipuleucel-T [37]. Analysis of
immune parameters that correlated with survival in the
phase III trials demonstrated that the activation and the
number of activated APCs in the administered product
correlated with longer survival [28]. This is interpreted
to be associated with the development of a long-term
immune response, potentially leading to prolonged OS
[28]. There have been some studies of sipuleucel-T in
patients with non-metastatic disease, including a ran-
domized study, suggesting an improvement in PSA
doubling after testosterone normalization following lim-
ited ADT in vaccine vs. placebo-treated patients [38].
Data from a trial with another immunological agent
have similarly suggested a possible benefit in patients
with lower disease burden. A recently published study of
ipilimumab in patients with mCRPC who were treated
after palliative radiation and had progressed after doce-
taxel did not meet its primary endpoint target of in-
creased OS [25]. However, in a retrospective subgroup
analysis, this study suggested that a subpopulation with
less advanced disease derived greater benefit from ipili-
mumab compared to placebo [25]. This subgroup con-
sisted of patients with non-visceral disease, alkaline
phosphatase less than 1.5 times the upper limit of nor-
mal, and hemoglobin of 11 gm/dL or greater. For this
subset, the median OS of patients treated with ipilimu-
mab was 22.7 months compared with 15.8 months for
the patients who received placebo. The median OS for
patients with even one of the poor prognostic factors
listed above was 6.5 months among those treated with
ipilimumab and 7.3 months for those who received pla-
cebo (p = 0.8756). However, we would underscore that to
date there are no prospective data to support the use of
CTLA-4 as a monotherapy for mCRPC. Similarly, in two
phase I trials of nivolumab, an anti-PD-1 antibody,
among 25 heavily pre-treated patients with prostate can-
cer, there were no objective responses [26, 27]. Conse-
quently, there are also no data to support the efficacy of
checkpoint blockade with PD-1 or PD-L1 blockade as
monotherapy in patients with advanced prostate cancer.
Consensus recommendations
Based on recent data and accumulated experience with
immune activating agents in patients with prostate can-
cer, immunotherapy may achieve greater benefit among
mCPRC patients treated earlier in the disease course.
The level of data supporting this is Level B from subset
analyses of randomized clinical trials in patients with
mCRPC [9–11, 25]. However, there are currently no ap-
propriate efficacy data to support the use of sipuleucel-T
in patients with non-metastatic prostate cancer.
Immunotherapy for mCRPC
What is the appropriate use of immunotherapy in the
treatment of mCRPC?
The panel was in agreement that there is a role for the
use of sipuleucel-T in the management of mCRPC prior
to chemotherapy in the era of abiraterone and enzaluta-
mide. The role of sipuleucel-T may be somewhat limited,
but the optimal patients for this approach should be
carefully defined, such that patients with mCRPC have
McNeel et al. Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer  (2016) 4:92 
Page 4 of 12
 as many options as possible. Its use in an earlier disease
state may theoretically be more optimal as discussed
above, given that a retrospective evaluation showed that
a lower PSA level at the start of treatment appeared to
correlate with longer OS in the IMPACT trial [37].
However, the current evidence-based recommendation is
in asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients
with mCRPC. This recommendation could be more
stringently defined to optimize benefit. This recommen-
dation is supported by Level A evidence from random-
ized trials and meta-analyses [9–11, 39].
Literature review and analysis
The pivotal placebo-controlled phase III trial that led to
the approval of sipuleucel-T, and two other supportive
phase III trials, showed a clinically meaningful and sta-
tistically significant survival benefit (25.8 months versus
21.7 months, p = 0.03, hazard ratio 0.78), independent of
the outcome of PSA decline or progression-free survival
(PFS) [9–11]. There was some conjecture that in the set-
ting of immunotherapy, the short term response param-
eters may not be surrogates for OS. Reports and analysis
suggest that immune response generated by sipuleucel-T
may correlate with survival benefit [28, 40, 41].
Consensus recommendations
The level of the evidence to support sipuleucel-T in
mCRPC was debated by the panel. Those who based
their position on the three randomized trials felt the data
was level A in support of sipuleucel-T, based on an ap-
propriately powered randomized controlled study and
two meta-analyses of the clinical trials studies confirm-
ing a statistically significant and clinically meaningful
survival benefit [30, 31]. Others felt the evidence to be
weak to moderate given that one of the supportive trials
was not completed, and OS was not the primary end-
point of two of these trials. It was noted that the total
number of patients and statistical power were less than
required
by
the
AUA
Guidelines.
Therefore,
AUA
Guidelines recently considered the evidence to be level
B [32]. In addition, guidelines from ASCO rated the rec-
ommendation strength for sipuleucel-T to be weak due
to unclear quality of life benefit, although benefits in
overall survival are supported [31]. However, the NCCN
guidelines rated the strength of the recommendations of
sipuleucel-T in this setting as category 1 [29]. Moreover,
guidance from the EAU also rated the recommendation
to use sipuleucel T in this setting as level A [30], consist-
ent with the SITC rating system in which the evidence
was considered level A.
This difference of opinion may account for the per-
ceived need for additional investigations into the mech-
anism of action, and the investigations into other
measures of immune activation, resulting from this
treatment as well as other immunotherapies entering
clinical evaluation. With sipuleucel-T, there may have
been a long-term immune activation in those who ap-
peared to have a longer OS [28], and others have de-
scribed an alteration in the tumor growth kinetics, and
changes in tumor microenvironment [42, 43]. Because a
vaccine-induced immune response should lead to initial
immune-mediated
tumor
cell
death, other antigens
within the tumor (e.g., neo-epitopes) can theoretically be
presented back to the immune system. This tumor im-
munity cycle can lead to a broader, and potentially more
clinically relevant, immune response known as “antigen
spread.” However, this is an ongoing dynamic and iterative
process that may take some time before becoming clinic-
ally apparent. This process of antigen spreading has been
demonstrated following treatment with sipuleucel-T and
retrospectively demonstrated to be associated with pro-
longed OS [41]. This process needs to be further evaluated
as additional immunotherapies enter the clinical arena.
With respect to an overall role for immunotherapy in
the treatment of mCRPC, the general consensus was
that there are major characteristics of mCRPC that favor
an
immunotherapy
approach.
Therefore,
the
goals
should be to define optimal patient and tumor charac-
teristics, identify best immunotherapy approaches, and
identify the optimal sequence of immunotherapy with
other available treatments that will benefit patients.
Additional discussion centered on the type of clinical
endpoints that reflect clinical benefit.
Can optimal patient candidates be identified for an
immunotherapy approach? will it be the same or
different for different immunotherapy agents?
With sipuleucel-T, the recommendation was for use in
asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients with
mCRPC. Further retrospective analysis defined those
with lower PSA to have a potentially greater survival
benefit [37]. In the subgroup analysis in the randomized
trial of ipilimumab versus placebo, the patients who did
not have poor prognostic features (no visceral metasta-
ses, hemoglobin > 11, alkaline phosphatase < 1.5 ULN)
had greater survival with ipilimumab treatment com-
pared with those treated with placebo [25], suggesting
that similar populations may be preferable for other im-
munotherapy agents.
Consensus recommendations
The majority of the panel (71%) recommended using
clinical laboratory tests to select patients for use of
sipuleucel-T by evaluating PSA, complete blood count
(CBC), and liver enzymes. The intent was to rule out in-
dividuals at risk for rapid disease progression, although
no specific laboratory thresholds precluding patients
from treatment were discussed. In addition, the panel
McNeel et al. Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer  (2016) 4:92 
Page 5 of 12
 also discussed whether the extent of disease by im-
aging determines whether to initiate treatment with
sipuleucel-T. Sixty-four percent of the panel felt that
the extent of disease as determined by imaging should be
used to select patients for sipuleucel-T. Overall, the panel
recommended using the rate of change at disease sites by
imaging, reflecting the pace of the disease, to determine
whether immunotherapy is appropriate. The panel recom-
mended that those with rapidly growing disease not re-
ceive immunotherapy. Similarly, the panel would exclude
patients with liver metastases.
These recommendations were based on prospective
analysis of stratification factors and retrospective analysis
of clinical and laboratory factors among patients en-
rolled
in
prospective
randomized
clinical
trials
of
sipuleucel-T.
Literature review and analysis
Based on data from the randomized trials of sipuleucel-
T,
those
patients
with
minimally
to
asymptomatic
disease and low initial PSA had the greatest survival
benefit, reflecting earlier and less rapidly progressive dis-
ease [9–11, 37]. Additionally those able to mount an im-
mune response also appeared to have greater benefit
[28]. The subgroup analysis from the randomized trial of
ipilimumab versus placebo also supports the selection of
patients with better prognostic features as those able to
generate an immune response and derive benefit from
immunologic treatment.
Clinical parameters can be selected prior to treatment,
but currently there are no biomarkers that will predict
the expected degree of immunologic activation. The dis-
covery of reliable predictive immune biomarkers remains
a high research priority.
What is the impact of corticosteroid therapy (used in
conjunction with previous treatment), chemotherapy, and
secondary hormonal agents? Can patients continue on
corticosteroids and receive immunotherapy for mCRPC, in
particular sipuleucel-T, if utilized following these agents?
Corticosteroids are included in regimens used in the initial
treatment of metastatic prostate cancer, and may precede
treatment with sipuleucel-T, and possibly other evolving
immunotherapies. The duration of such therapy will im-
pact whether there needs to be a weaning process, or
whether patients will require continued physiologic cor-
ticosteroid therapy. However, the prior use of high dose
corticosteroids is not thought to be problematic for subse-
quent immune-based treatment.
Consensus recommendations
The discussion evaluated both stopping steroids and
continuing physiologic doses. Essentially, it was felt that
after a short course of corticosteroids, it is not necessary
to wean off corticosteroids. The panel was in agreement
(100%) that it is not necessary to wean corticosteroids
from a dose equivalent of 10 mg/day prednisone in order
to treat with sipuleucel-T.
For patients who have been treated with abiraterone/
corticosteroids for 6 months or longer, and are taking
physiologic doses of glucocorticoids, the patient can
proceed with sipuleucel-T and would be expected to
produce adequate numbers of dendritic cells. The level
of evidence is considered Level B, based on a random-
ized phase II trial of concurrent vs. sequential abirater-
one and sipuleucel-T showing no impact of abiraterone/
corticosteroids on sipuleucel-T induced APC activation
and antigen spread [44].
Literature review and analysis
Several investigators have evaluated the immune re-
sponse to sipuleucel-T and the enumeration of activated
APCs, which is an FDA-approved release criteria for this
product [45]. Whereas the number and activation state
of APCs produced may impact the outcome of treatment
[28], ongoing corticosteroid treatment as used in pros-
tate cancer does not appear to affect the level of activa-
tion of APCs or subsequent antigen spread [39], both of
which have been positively associated with clinical out-
come [25, 32, 33]. There is no data suggesting an impact
of corticosteroids on the clinical outcome of treatment
with sipuleucel-T [44–47].
What is the preferred sequence of agents for the
management of patients with minimally symptomatic (or
asymptomatic) metastatic, castration-resistant prostate
cancer?
Several agents have been approved for second-line treat-
ment of prostate cancer, once the disease has become re-
fractory to initial androgen deprivation. Sipuleucel-T is
approved for minimally symptomatic or asymptomatic
patients in this setting. Investigational immunotherapies
are also being evaluated in this setting. The rationale for
deciding which agent to use first with disease recurrence
after initial ADT currently depends on the clinical status
of the patient and the extent, site(s), and pace of the
disease.
Consensus recommendations
Two approaches were discussed by the panel as follows:
1) sipuleucel-T first or 2) an androgen receptor-targeted
agent (such as abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide) first
followed by sipuleucel-T. The majority of the panel rec-
ommended the use of sipuleucel-T first (90%), while the
minority of the panel recommended the second ap-
proach (10%). Moreover, the panel was in agreement
(100%) that it was optimal to use one of these ap-
proaches prior to radium and chemotherapy. Given the
McNeel et al. Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer  (2016) 4:92 
Page 6 of 12
 importance of immunologic activation and the asymp-
tomatic status of the patient, 100% of the panel recom-
mended that when sipuleucel-T is used, it be used first if
all other criteria are met.
Literature review and analysis
As noted in the above discussions and literature review,
the primary goal of sipuleucel-T therapy is to generate
an appropriate immune response directed against the
prostate tumor [28, 41, 43, 46–48]. This immune re-
sponse, once generated, can persist long after the treat-
ment is given, unlike the expected impact of an androgen
receptor targeted therapy. A number of phase I-II clinical
trials are underway to evaluate the optimal sequencing of
sipuleucel-T with other agents and to investigate whether
measures of immunological activation correlate with clin-
ical outcome.
What are the special issues and clinical management
recommendations in the use of sipuleucel-T for the
treatment of mCRPC?
There are detailed guidelines in the pharmaceutical
package insert for the management of patients undergo-
ing treatment with sipuleucel-T. The panel discussed
these guidelines in detail as well as the issues related to
patient monitoring. The relevant issues discussed in-
cluded the evaluation of hematologic parameters for
apheresis, monitoring patients during the infusion of
activated cells, issues of central line infection, and
follow-up monitoring of disease status after treatment is
completed.
Consensus recommendations
The panel accepted the guidelines as outlined in the
pharmaceutical Full Prescribing Information (package
insert) for the production and administration of this spe-
cific immunotherapy agent. Any guidelines regarding
other immunotherapy will be product specific. It was
recommended that laboratory parameters as noted in
the Full Prescribing Information through the course of
apheresis be followed. Guidelines for hematologic pa-
rameters for apheresis are determined by the apheresis
center. It was generally believed by the panel that pa-
tients do not require clinical evaluation prior to each
cellular infusion if the previous one was uncomplicated.
Infusions are typically completed in oncology or urology
infusion centers and are monitored as per any other cel-
lular infusion [9–11].
Literature review and analysis
The major concerns are related to the need in some pa-
tients for central venous access to accomplish apheresis
and the need to maintain such a line for the 4-6 weeks
required for the procedures. This was evaluated for the
IMPACT trial in which 23% of subjects required a cen-
tral line for apheresis, and 12% developed infection re-

[9–11]. However,
as
centers
become more experienced management of central lines
improves in general. Peripheral veins can be used in sub-
jects as well, depending on the availability and quality of
peripheral veins as determined by the apheresis center.
What are the monitoring parameters following sipuleucel-T
therapy?
Consensus recommendations
Standard practice is used in terms of PSA and radio-
logic monitoring for patients with advanced prostate
cancer. Eighty percent of the panel stated they would
not
change
their
standard
monitoring
procedure,
while 20% reported that they would by obtaining a
new baseline status immediately after completion of
the infusions. These recommendations are based on
level C evidence, as the evaluations performed in clin-
ical trials leading to the approval of sipuleucel-T were
typically done at 12 weeks rather than immediately
following treatment.
Literature review and analysis
There are currently no additional monitoring procedures
or
biomarkers
for
following
patients
treated
with
sipuleucel-T [8–10]. The apheresis product is assessed
for the number of CD54 cells, but this is not followed
after completion of the infusions [45].
Recent papers suggest that eosinophilia may correlate
with prolonged survival in patients receiving sipuleucel-
T for mCRPC, but this is not yet standard and deserves
further investigation [49].
How long do you wait after the last biweekly treatment
with sipuleucel-T before considering another therapy?
Consensus recommendations
Although there was not a consensus of opinion among
the panel, several options were discussed. The minority
of the panel (10%) recommended moving to a new ther-
apy immediately. However, this option was recom-
mended in the setting of a program that is a two-part
treatment approach (e.g., sipuleucel-T followed by enza-
lutamide). Thirty percent of the panel recommended
that it should depend on individual patient characteris-
tics and the pace of the disease. The majority of the
panel (60%) recommended waiting for an event/progres-
sion before beginning a subsequent therapy.
How do you determine that it is time to start another
treatment after having used sipuleucel-T?
Consensus recommendations
The next treatment may be triggered by an event or ini-
tiated earlier. Patients must be aware that immunologic

 therapy may take time and that typical measures of re-
sponse, as determined by decreases in serum PSA or size
of lesions on radiographic studies, are not likely to be af-
fected. To address the issues involved with the atypical
response measured with immunotherapy, the FDA has
drafted guidance for industry concerning treatment past
progression when using therapeutic cancer vaccines
[50].
Moreover,
in
measuring
treatment
response,
immune-related response criteria have been developed
to more accurately measure the response patterns ob-
served with immunotherapy [51]. Managing patient ex-
pectations with a therapy such as this is consequently
important and complex. These outcomes are based on
results from phase III trials and on clinical experience,
and hence are considered Level A evidence.
Are there other considerations for repeat dosing or
changes in the dosing schedule of sipuleucel-T?
Consensus recommendations
There are clinical situations in which there may be
increased intervals between doses. There are no im-
munological hypotheses that would preclude continu-
ing infusions, even with a delay. Currently the data
that exist are observations during the randomized
clinical trials.
Literature review and analysis
The recommendations from this discussion were based
on the results and data from the phase III trials and
meta-analyses [9–11, 39, 52]. Essentially they reflect the
methodology in the literature and the pharmaceutical
guidelines. At this time, there are no data to recommend
moving the frequency from every 2 weeks to every 4
weeks. However, there is no recognized harm from a
delay if it occurs.
Cost and value of sipuleucel-T
As the rising cost of cancer care has increasingly become
an area of concern among the oncology community, a
brief overview of the cost as well as considerations of
the value of sipuleucel-T was added after the panel
meeting. The average wholesale price for sipuleucel-T is
approximately $93,000 per patient for a complete course
of treatment (over about 1 month). While this is consid-
erably higher as a monthly cost compared with other
treatments for advanced prostate cancer, this cost is
similar to costs for other therapies when factored over
time (Table 1). Moreover, a direct cost comparison does
not take into account the relative paucity of side effects
from sipuleucel-T compared with chemotherapies that
may lead to additional costs due to hospitalization, cost
of growth factor support, cost of multiple infusions, and

Future perspectives
What is the potential use of sipuleucel-T in combination
with other agents?
The
panel
discussed
the
potential
of
combining
sipuleucel-T with other agents. Agents discussed included
androgen pathway targeted agents (e.g., bicalutamide,
nilutamide, enzalutamide, and abiraterone acetate), zole-
dronic acid, and denosumab. The majority of the panel
(58%) reported having ever combined sipuleucel-T with
other agents. However, the panel was in agreement (100%)
that they do not routinely use a combination approach
with sipuleucel-T. The consensus discussion continued
with considering whether sipuleucel-T should be used in
combination, and concluded that all of these therapies
were reasonable to investigate in combination with
sipuleucel-T. In fact, a number of phase I and phase II tri-
als are active or in development [44, 47, 48] (Table 2). This
assessment is considered Level B evidence, based on nu-
merous ongoing prospective clinical trials.
The panel also discussed these issues in the context of
immunotherapy agents that are in very advanced stages
of clinical evaluation. PSA-TRICOM is a therapeutic
vaccine associated with a 44% reduction of risk of death
in a randomized phase II trial [22]. A subsequent phase
III study completed enrollment with 1297 patients in
2015, with overall survival expected to be reported in
2017. Recent reports describe the outcome of two
cooperative group clinical trials with combinations of
PSA-TRICOM vaccine with docetaxel or with sequential
androgen ablation therapy [54, 55]. Immunotherapy tri-
als combining vaccines and checkpoint inhibitors to
further activate the immune response are also of interest
and ongoing [21, 56, 57]. In addition, the use of other
agents to enhance antigen presentation is being ex-
plored. Many different combination approaches, with
sipuleucel-T and with other immunotherapy agents, are
ongoing [58]. Phase III trials of vaccines and immune
modulators are ongoing (Table 3). Immune monitoring
continues to be a major component of evaluating the ef-
fects of immunotherapy.
Conclusions
Currently there is one FDA-approved immunotherapeutic
agent for the treatment of mCRPC, providing a proof of
principle that continues to stimulate the investigation of
other immune approaches for prostate cancer. Additional
phase III trials of immunotherapy agents as well as com-
bination trials are ongoing and results will be reported in
the near future. Further elucidation of patient-related
characteristics and predictive immunological parameters
of clinical benefit is the subject of ongoing investigations.
The key to future development of immunotherapy in
prostate cancer will be the delineation of the optimal se-
quence of immunotherapy, as single agents or in combin-
ation, with other active therapies for this disease.
