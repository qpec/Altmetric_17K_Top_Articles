The combination of an increasing number of new cancer cases and improving survival rates has led to a large
and rapidly growing population with unique health-care requirements. Exercise has been proposed as a strategy
to help address the issues faced by cancer patients. Supported by a growing body of research, major health orga-
nizations commonly identify the importance of incorporating exercise in cancer care and advise patients to be
physically active. This systematic review comprehensively summarizes the available epidemiologic and random-
ized controlled trial evidence investigating the role of exercise in the management of cancer. Literature searches
focused on determining the potential impact of exercise on 1) cancer mortality and recurrence and 2) adverse ef-
fects of cancer and its treatment. A total of 100 studies were reviewed involving thousands of individual patients
whose exercise behavior was assessed following the diagnosis of any type of cancer. Compared with patients
who performed no/less exercise, patients who exercised following a diagnosis of cancer were observed to have a
lower relative risk of cancer mortality and recurrence and experienced fewer/less severe adverse effects. The find-
ings of this review support the view that exercise is an important adjunct therapy in the management of cancer.
Implications on cancer care policy and practice are discussed.

INTRODUCTION
Improvements in screening, diagnosis, and treatments of
cancer have resulted in an exponential increase in the num-
ber of cancer survivors alive in the United States and other
industrialized nations. Within the United States, it is esti-
mated that there are 15 million cancer survivors (1). Within
Australia, the estimate is 340,000 (2). In both countries, the
estimate is that there will be a substantive increase in this
number over the coming years. For example, in the United
States, it is anticipated that there are currently 14.5 million
cancer survivors (1). To put this in context, it is estimated
that there are currently 21 million Americans diagnosed with
diabetes (3).
Within the growing population of cancer survivors, there
are 2 major categories of health concerns. The first is the
concern regarding cancer recurrence and mortality. The sec-
ond category includes the persistent adverse effects of can-
cer treatment. Multiple observational and interventional
trials have been undertaken to evaluate the potential efficacy
of exercise training to improve outcomes relevant to cancer
recurrence and mortality, as well as persistent adverse ef-
fects of treatment. Below, we review the effects of exercise
on the 2 most important categories of outcomes among can-
cer survivors. In section 1, we review the evidence that exer-
cise has a meaningful impact on cancer recurrence and
mortality. In section 2, we review the evidence that exercise
has a meaningful impact on cancer morbidity resulting
from the adverse effects of cancer treatment. During the
final section, we comment on policy and practice issues to
address the needs for exercise programming for cancer sur-
vivors in both the United States and Australia. The goal of
the review is to place in context the breadth and depth of
the efforts to address these needs among survivors, with a
conclusion that suggests possible next steps toward the
shared goal of improving outcomes in this growing chronic
disease population.

 METHODS
Search strategy
This study was conducted in accordance with the Preferred
Reporting Items of Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses
(PRISMA) statement (4). Two separate literature searches
were conducted to evaluate the impact of exercise following
a cancer diagnosis on 1) cancer mortality and recurrence
(review 1) and 2) the adverse effects of cancer and its treat-
ment (review 2). Searches were carried out in August 2016
by using PubMed, MEDLINE, and Cochrane Central Regis-
ter of Controlled Trials databases, as well as reviewing refer-
ence lists for additional potentially relevant articles. Web
Table 1 (available at http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/) details the
full listing of search terms used for the 2 literature searches.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Participants included adults diagnosed with any form of
cancer, and articles published in the English language from
all available years through to August 2016 were considered
for inclusion for review 1. Review 1 included epidemiologic
studies, interventional trials, and systematic reviews/meta-
analyses that evaluated associations between exercise behav-
ior and cancer mortality and/or cancer recurrence. Studies
that reported all-cause mortality but did not independently
report cancer-specific mortality were excluded, as were stud-
ies that did not report exercise behavior independent of other
exposures/lifestyle behaviors. Additionally, studies were
excluded if they did not report exercise levels postcancer
diagnosis. Publications with any length of follow-up were
considered for eligibility. Review 2 included randomized
controlled trials (RCTs) and systematic reviews/meta-analyses
that evaluated associations between exercise behavior and per-
sistent adverse effects of cancer and its treatment. Interventions
of all lengths were included. Given our prior meta-analyses on
this topic (5, 6), we excluded RCTs and meta-analyses pub-
lished before 2011 or that had fewer than 50 participants per
group. We also chose a specific grouping of adverse effects on
which to focus, and if the effects of exercise on the adverse
effect were included in a meta-analysis, the RCTs on that out-
come were not reviewed.
Outcomes
The primary outcomes for review 1 included risk of
cancer-specific mortality and risk of cancer recurrence ex-
pressed as a hazard ratio or relative risk with 95% confidence
interval. The secondary outcome was all-cause mortality ex-
pressed as a hazard ratio or relative risk with 95% confidence
interval. These data were reported for comparisons between a
reference group who performed no/less exercise versus a
comparator group who performed a greater volume, fre-
quency, and/or intensity of exercise. The primary outcomes
for review 2 were distinct for the randomized control trials
and the meta-analyses. For the RCTs, outcomes included
bone health, cognitive function, sexuality, treatment-related
symptoms, urinary incontinence, anemia, nausea/vomiting,
and dyspnea. For the meta-analyses, outcomes included
psychosocial health parameters (e.g., anxiety, depression,
psychosocial distress, emotional well-being, mental health,
and stress); body image; fatigue; lymphedema; physical func-
tion; physical health; quality of life; shoulder disability; and
sleep. These data were reported for comparisons between can-
cer survivors randomized to an exercise intervention and can-
cer survivors who did not perform an exercise intervention.
Data extraction
Titles and abstracts of the initial search return were as-
sessed for eligibility by E.M.Z. (review 1) and X.Z. (review
2). Duplicates were removed, and articles that were outside
the scope of the reviews were excluded (Figures 1 and 2).
Full-text articles were assessed for eligibility by E.M.Z. and
P.C. for review 1 and by X.Z. and K.H.S. for review 2. Any
discrepancies regarding inclusion and exclusion criteria
were resolved by consensus. Characteristics of eligible stud-
ies were extracted, and data were reported in line with the
purpose of each review.
Study quality assessment
The quality and risk of bias of each study were assessed by
using 1 of 2 tools in line with the study design: the Cochrane
Collaboration’s tool for assessing risk of bias in randomized
trials (7) and the Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale
for cohort studies (8). The Cochrane Collaboration’s tool
evaluates the bias of interventional trials on the basis of 6
domains—selection, performance, detection, attrition, report-
ing, and other—and is scored on the basis of high, low, or
unclear risk-of-bias categories (7). The Newcastle-Ottawa
scale assesses the quality of epidemiologic/observational
studies by using 3 domains—selection, comparability, and
outcome—and is scored on a scale from 0 to 9 points, with
higher scores representing better quality studies (8). Study
quality assessments were conducted by E.M.Z. (review 1)
and X.Z. (review 2) and reported in Web Table 2.
Data analysis
Meta-analyses were not performed, and a narrative syn-
thesis was conducted instead because of the heterogeneity in
participant characteristics, exercise measures and interven-
tions, and the broad variety of outcomes for review 2, as well
as the analytical strategies applied to the trials within these
reviews. However, a systematic search of previously pub-
lished meta-analyses was conducted, and the results of these
meta-analyses have been included within the narrative syn-
thesis. Results of the narrative synthesis are summarized in
Tables 1–5 and Web Table 3, with studies presented accord-
ing to cancer type and sample size in descending order.
RESULTS
Study selection
The literature search for review 1 (cancer mortality and
recurrence) identified 5,258 articles with an additional
4 articles identified from reference lists (Figure 1). After

 duplicates were removed and titles and abstracts were
screened, 74 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility.
Thirty-eight articles were excluded for not meeting the eli-
gibility criteria, leaving 36 articles included within review 1.
The literature search for review 2 (adverse effects of cancer and
its treatment) identified 3,066 articles (Figure 2). After dupli-
cates were removed and titles and abstracts were screened, 667
full-text articles were assessed for eligibility; 603 articles were
excluded for not meeting the eligibility criteria, leaving 40
meta-analyses and 24 articles representing 23 RCTs included
within review 2. Therefore, this systematic review included a
total of 100 studies.
Study characteristics and quality
Review 1 included 32 prospective cohort studies with
follow-up spanning from ~2 to 20 years (9–40) and 4 RCTs
with experimental follow-up between ~1 and 7 years (41–44).
There were a total of 68,285 participants involved in these
studies comprising mainly patients with breast cancer (66%),
colorectal cancer (15%), and prostate cancer (14%). Risk of
cancer-specific mortality was reported by 85% of the studies,
with 36% of the studies reporting risk of cancer recurrence
and 89% of the studies reporting all-cause mortality risk.
Among the epidemiologic studies, exercise levels were

 assessed by using a variety of self-report and interview-
administered questionnaires that evaluated a range of domains
of exercise behaviors. The majority of these studies reported
the dosage of exercise based on the number of metabolic
equivalent hours per week, but a range of other analysis meth-
ods to quantify exercise levels was also utilized. Within the
intervention trials, exercise behavior was compared between
groups of patients who were randomized into a supervised
exercise intervention versus a control condition not involving
any structured exercise program (Table 1).
Review 2 included 23 RCTs with interventions that lasted
between 4 weeks and 12 months (45–68). There were a total

 of 3,735 participants involved in the 23 trials comprising
mainly patients with breast cancer (85%) and prostate cancer
(10%). The remaining 5% were a mix of other less common
cancer sites. Of the 23 RCTs, 43% were conducted during
active treatment, 22% were conducted during the posttreat-
ment period, 17% were conducted in prostate cancer patients
during androgen deprivation therapy, and the remainder did
not clarify the timing of the intervention with regard to treat-
ment. Changes in persistent adverse treatment effects were
compared between groups of patients who were randomized
into an exercise intervention versus a control condition not
involving any structured exercise program (Web Table 3).
The 40 meta-analyses in review 2 included 257 reported
studies with 9,126 patients who participated in RCTs. Ten
(25%) of the meta-analyses focused on breast cancer survi-
vors (69–78), 21 (45%) included trials with a broad variety
of cancer diagnoses (79–99), and there were 2 meta-analyses
each that focused on the adverse effects among prostate
(100, 101), hematological (102, 103), and lung (104, 105)
malignancies. Finally, there was 1 meta-analysis each that
focused specifically on the adverse effects of treatment
among colorectal (106), head and neck (107), and gyneco-
logical cancer survivors (108). The most common outcomes
examined were fatigue (24 meta-analyses) (70, 71, 73, 76–
80, 82, 85–87, 89–94, 96–98, 102, 103, 106), quality of life
(15 meta-analyses) (74, 75, 77, 78, 82, 88, 92, 93, 99, 100,
102, 103, 105, 106, 108), and depression (11 meta-analyses)
(70, 77–79, 81, 82, 84, 87, 92, 98, 101).
Cancer mortality and recurrence
Data synthesized in review 1 suggest a consistent trend
for reduced risk of cancer-specific mortality, cancer recur-
rence, and all-cause mortality in patients who have superior
exercise behaviors (Table 1). Significantly lower risk of
cancer-specific mortality was observed for patients with
higher exercise levels in 17 of the 30 studies reporting
cancer-specific mortality (9, 11, 12, 19, 22–26, 28–32, 35,
36, 40). Studies reporting a statistically significant associa-
tion between exercise level and cancer mortality involved
patients with breast (11, 12, 19, 23, 24, 26), colorectal (9, 22,
29, 31–33, 35, 40), and prostate (28) cancer, as well as eval-
uations involving patients with groups of various cancers
combined (25, 30). Significantly lower risk of cancer recur-
rence was observed for patients with higher exercise levels
in 4 of the 9 studies reporting cancer recurrence (24, 33, 37,
38). Studies reporting a statistically significant association
between exercise level and cancer recurrence involved pa-
tients with breast (24, 38), colorectal (33), and prostate (37)
cancer. Of the 25 studies reporting all-cause mortality, 22 re-
ported significantly lower risk of all-cause mortality among
patients with higher exercise levels (9–13, 15, 19, 20, 23–33,
36, 38, 40). It is unclear from this review if there is any varia-
tion in the magnitude of protective effect against cancer-
specific mortality, cancer recurrence, and/or all-cause mortality
according to the type of cancer or the exercise dosage (modal-
ity, volume, intensity, frequency). There was considerable var-
iability in the time since diagnosis at which exercise levels
were assessed (refer to Table 1). Although the vast majority of
studies excluded deaths that occurred early in the follow-up
Table 4.

 phase, it is unclear from this review if the timing of assess-
ment influenced the observed relationship between exercise
levels and cancer progression. All but 3 studies (17, 30, 39)
reported that they controlled for cancer stage or grade, mak-
ing it difficult to draw any conclusions regarding the poten-
tial influence of stage/grade on exercise levels and/or
cancer outcomes.
Studies involving experimental follow-up of RCTs did
not report any statistically significant associations between
exercise levels and cancer-specific mortality, cancer recur-
rence, or all-cause mortality (41–44). However, these studies
were not designed or powered to evaluate any of these end-
points and involved a relatively low number of participants
(n = 60–242). Rather, the primary endpoints for these trials
were quality of life (41), physical function (42), fatigue (43),
and bone density (44). Data reported in Table 1 are based on
exploratory follow-ups probing any interaction between
exercise levels and cancer recurrence, cancer mortality, and/
or all-cause mortality.
Results of the previously published meta-analyses evalu-
ating cancer mortality and recurrence have been summarized
in Table 2 (109–118). These analyses report that patients
diagnosed with cancer who were more physically active had
a lower relative risk of breast cancer mortality (pooled haz-
ard ratios range from 0.71 to 0.59), colorectal cancer mortal-
ity (pooled hazard ratios range from 0.70 to 0.56), and
cancer-specific mortality from a variety of cancer types
(pooled hazard ratios range from 0.63 to 0.60). Patients who
were more physically active also had a lower relative risk of
breast cancer recurrence (pooled hazard ratios range from
0.79 to 0.76). Furthermore, cancer patients with more posi-
tive exercise behaviors are observed to have a lower relative
risk of all-cause mortality (pooled hazard ratios range from
0.75 to 0.52). Web Table 4 specifies which original data sets
were included within each of the meta-analyses reviewed in
this article. This article reviews data from 5 original studies
that have not been included in any previous meta-analysis
(11, 22, 34, 36, 40). These new data continue to support the
findings of prior meta-analyses, reporting lower relative risk
of cancer recurrence, cancer mortality, and all-cause mortal-
ity in people with breast (11, 36) and colorectal (22, 34, 40)
cancer who are more physically active. These new data have
expanded into new areas not previously investigated by
exploring the relationship between exercise and cancer out-
comes based on variations in factors that have been impli-
cated in cancer progression (e.g., estrogen receptor status,
cyclooxygenase 2 status).
Effects of exercise on adverse treatment effects
Data synthesized in review 2 suggest variability in the
efficacy of exercise to improve adverse treatment effects by
adverse effect, tumor site, intervention, and timing of the
intervention with regard to treatment (Web Table 3).
Treatment symptoms.
The effects of exercise interven-
tions on treatment symptoms (e.g., breast, endocrine, taxane
related, arm, or general treatment-related symptoms) were
evaluated in 7 recent randomized trials (48–50, 54, 59, 61): 4
in breast cancer (50, 54, 59, 61), 2 in prostate cancer (48, 49),
and 1 in breast and colorectal cancers (46). Statistically

 significant improvements in treatment-related symptoms
were noted in 2 of the 7 studies, both with breast cancer sur-
vivors and conducted during chemotherapy (46, 50). One of
these studies prescribed 10,000 steps of walking daily and
noted that breast symptoms were reduced by half in the exer-
cise group, compared with a small increase in the control
group (46). In the other study, the significant effects were
noted in comparing a lower with a higher intensity exercise
program, with significant treatment effects on reducing
symptoms only among women in the higher intensity aero-
bic exercise program, or the higher intensity program that
combined aerobic and resistance exercise (50).
Bone health.
The effects of exercise training on bone
health outcomes were evaluated in 7 trials (56, 58, 60, 64–68):
4 in breast cancer (60, 64, 65, 67, 68), 2 in prostate cancer,
(56, 66), and 1 focused on bony metastases in the spine
(58). All 4 of the studies in breast cancer survivors were
conducted posttreatment, and only 1 showed any significant
effect on bone outcomes (64). Winters-Stone et al. (64) showed
that an exercise intervention that focused on resistance training
combined with impact exercise can stabilize spinal bone min-
eral density when compared with a control group (P < 0.01).
Winters-Stone et al. (66) observed a very similar result in pros-
tate cancer survivors undergoing androgen deprivation
therapy. The other trial in prostate cancer survivors did
not observe any significant effect of high load strength
training 3 times weekly during androgen deprivation ther-
apy (56). Finally, thrice weekly resistance training during
6 months of radiotherapy for metastases to the spine re-
sulted in significantly improved spine bone density com-
pared with passive physical therapy (58).
Sexual health.
Sexual health outcomes were examined
in 5 studies: 3 in breast cancer (52, 59, 62) and 3 in prostate
cancer (48, 49, 53). Among breast cancer patients, combined
cognitive behavioral therapy and a 12-week home-based
exercise program conducted posttreatment improved scores
related to sexual activity and sexual pleasure (52). No signif-
icant effect was seen in an intervention for breast cancer pa-
tients undertaken during radiotherapy or an intervention
undertaken once weekly, after treatment (59, 62). Among
prostate cancer patients receiving androgen deprivation ther-
apy, a 3-month program including aerobic and resistance
exercise improved sexual function scores on the prostate
cancer-specific quality-of-life survey of the European Orga-
nization for Research and Treatment for Cancer (EORTC
QLQ-PR25) (48). By contrast, 5 supervised walking ses-
sions per week had no effect on sexual health among prostate
cancer patients postsurgery (53).
Cognitive health.
Cognitive health was an outcome in 5
trials (46, 47, 55, 59, 61), all of which included breast cancer
patients, 3 of which focused exclusively on breast cancer
(47, 59, 61). Two of the 5 observed significant improve-
ments in cognitive function, including an 8-week thrice
weekly aquatic exercise program conducted posttreatment
with breast cancer survivors (47) and a 4-week once weekly
cycle ergometry program that included breast and prostate
cancer patients (55).
Bowel and bladder function.
Five RCTs evaluated the
effects of exercise on bowel and bladder function after cancer
(46, 48, 49, 57, 63). Exercise resulted in significant improve-
ments in bowel and bladder outcomes in 2 of these trials,
including a 6-week yoga intervention that improved consti-
pation in breast cancer survivors posttreatment (63) and a
twice weekly resistance, flexibility, and kegel exercise inter-
vention in postsurgical prostate cancer survivors (57).
Hot flashes and anemia.
There were 2 trials each that ad-
dressed hot flashes (52, 61) and anemia (45, 51). For each of
these symptoms, there was 1 trial that showed a positive
effect (45). There was no evidence that exercise impacts nau-
sea and vomiting or dyspnea in the 1 trial that examined
these outcomes (46).
There were 40 meta-analyses identified as having been
published between 2011 and 2016 that examined the effects
of exercise interventions on adverse treatment effects
among adults diagnosed with cancer. Web Table 5 specifies
which original data sets were included within each of the
meta-analyses reviewed in this section. The outcomes
explored in these meta-analyses included fatigue, quality of
life, psychosocial distress, body image, sleep, physical
function, physical health, lymphedema, and shoulder dys-
function (Tables 3–5).
Fatigue.
Of the 24 meta-analyses that examined the ef-
fects of exercise on fatigue (70, 71, 73, 76–80, 82, 85–87,
89–94, 96–98, 102, 103, 106), all but 2 (70, 106) observed a
statistically significant effect. Five meta-analyses focused on
studies in breast cancer survivors, 1 meta-analysis in colo-
rectal cancer survivors, and the remainder grouped survivors
from a variety of cancers. Three of the meta-analyses
focused on the effects of exercise during chemotherapy; all 3
observed significant effects (71, 76, 94).
Quality of life.
The second most common outcome evalu-
ated in these meta-analyses was quality of life (15 publica-
tions) (74, 75, 77, 78, 82, 88, 92, 93, 99, 100, 102, 103, 105,
106, 108). Of these, 5 included a variety of cancer types (82,
88, 92, 93, 99), 4 focused on breast cancer (74, 75, 77, 78), 2
focused on hematological malignancies (102, 103), and 1
each focused on prostate, colorectal, lung, and gynecological
cancers (100, 105, 106, 108). The meta-analyses in a variety
of cancers, 3 of the 4 meta-analyses in breast cancer, and
both focused on hematological malignancies reported signif-
icant improvements in quality of life for cancer survivors
who exercised compared with those randomized to a com-
parison group (75, 77, 78, 102, 103). Evidence did not sup-
port a positive effect of exercise on quality of life in prostate,
lung, colorectal, or gynecological cancer survivors (100,
105, 106, 108).
Psychosocial distress.
Psychosocial distress-related out-
comes (e.g., psychosocial distress, anxiety, depression, stress,
emotional well-being, mental health) were examined in 12
meta-analyses, including 3 focused on breast cancer (70, 77,
78), 8 that included a variety of diagnoses (79, 81, 82, 84, 87,
92, 93, 98), and 1 that focused on prostate cancer survivors
(101). Ten of these showed significant improvements in 1 or
more of the above-noted psychosocial outcomes among can-
cer survivors randomized to exercise compared with those
randomized to a comparison group (70, 77, 78, 81, 82, 84,
87, 92, 93, 98). The exceptions included a small meta-
analysis that included only 2 randomized trials with multiple

 cancer diagnoses (79) and another meta-analysis that focused
on the effects of exercise on depression specifically among
prostate cancer survivors (101).
Body image, sleep, physical function, and more.
For the
remaining outcomes, there were from 1 to 5 meta-analyses
that sought to summarize the RCT evidence that exercise
training results in improved body image, sleep, physical
function, physical health, and shoulder dysfunction. With
few exceptions, the conclusions of these meta-analyses are
that exercise does have a significant positive effect on these
outcomes. The outcomes from meta-analyses regarding the
effects of exercise on lymphedema outcomes are compli-
cated by the possibility that the favorable outcome is no
harm (null findings) (69, 72, 75). Of the 3 meta-analyses that
examined this relationship, 2 observed no harm or benefit,
and 1 observed that exercise reduces edema (69).
DISCUSSION
Findings from this comprehensive review of observational
studies, interventional trials, and meta-analyses support the
view that exercise is an important adjunct therapy in the
management of cancer. Specifically, this review confirms
that cancer patients involved in greater levels of exercise
have a lower relative risk of cancer mortality and a lower rel-
ative risk of cancer recurrence, and they experience fewer
and/or less severe treatment-related adverse effects.
Cancer mortality and recurrence
Engaging in exercise following the diagnosis of cancer
was observed to have a protective effect against cancer-
specific mortality, cancer recurrence, and all-cause mortal-
ity. Based on the 11 meta-analyses that have evaluated these
outcomes to date, the magnitude of effect was observed to
be considerable (109–118). Specifically, superior levels of
exercise following a cancer diagnosis were associated with
a 28%–44% reduced risk of cancer-specific mortality, a
21%–35% lower risk of cancer recurrence, and a 25%–48%
decreased risk of all-cause mortality (Table 2). These data
quantify trends seen across the 36 studies investigating post-
diagnosis exercise levels in over 68,000 cancer patients (9–44).
Although the majority of these studies are observational and
therefore cannot infer causation, the apparent protective effect
of exercise was observed in multivariable-adjusted analyses
that account for a range of clinically relevant covariates associ-
ated with cancer progression (e.g., cancer stage, treatments,
smoking status, body mass index, comorbidities, and so on).
Most evaluations to date have involved breast (n > 45,000),
colorectal (n ~ 10,000), and prostate (n > 9,500) cancer pa-
tients. As such, it is unclear whether exercise is associated
with improved disease outcomes in patients diagnosed with
other types of cancer. Insufficient data exist to determine if
the degree of apparent protection varies according to cancer
type, stage, and/or treatment regimen. Furthermore, knowl-
edge is lacking regarding the influence of exercise dosage
on the magnitude of potential survival benefit; thus, it
is currently unclear what modality, volume, intensity, or
frequency of exercise shows the most promise for
improving disease outcomes.
A range of potential factors and mechanisms may contribute
to the relationship observed between exercise behavior and
cancer progression. Exercise may reduce the risk of cancer
mortality and recurrence by enhancing the ability of patients to
physically tolerate greater dosages of cancer treatment (119,
120). Exercise may reduce the rate and magnitude of antican-
cer therapy dose modifications by increasing functional capac-
ity and attenuating the severity of treatment-related adverse
effects, therefore allowing for higher treatment completion
rates (119, 120). Similarly, improved fitness has been associ-
ated with enhanced surgical outcomes including less complica-
tions and morbidity (121–123). There is also the possibility
that exercise may improve the effectiveness of anticancer treat-
ments by normalizing the tumor microenvironment and poten-
tially increasing transport of systemic therapies to cancer cells
(124). Another possible contributing factor is the potential of
more active patients being diagnosed with less aggressive tu-
mors (125). A range of biological mechanisms has been pro-
posed to mediate the protective effect of exercise on cancer
outcomes. Specifically, exercise may elicit positive changes in
inflammation, immunity, and oxidative stress, as well as in
metabolic and sex hormones, all of which are factors believed
to contribute to cancer progression (124, 126, 127). Emerging
research suggests that exercise-induced epigenetic modifica-
tions concordant with health-enhancing phenotypic adapta-
tions may also play a role in enhancing survival outcomes for
cancer patients (128, 129). Furthermore, regular exercise is an
established prophylactic measure that reduces the risk of
developing comorbid conditions, such as heart disease, hyper-
tension, diabetes, and osteoporosis. Although these factors
may represent some potential pathways, precise mechanisms
underlying the protective effect of exercise on cancer out-
comes are yet to be elucidated (126, 127).
A series of limitations exist that must be considered when
interpreting the results of this component of the review.
Inherent in the nature of epidemiologic investigations is the
inability to infer direct causality between exercise behavior
and cancer outcomes. Although this review also contains
RCTs incorporating experimental follow-up periods, these
trials were neither designed nor powered to investigate sur-
vival or recurrence endpoints (41–44). It is possible that ob-
servations of the protective effect of exercise may reflect
reverse causality rather than a physiological effect. Specifi-
cally, better outcomes may be reported for more active pa-
tients because they are less encumbered by advanced or
aggressive disease and/or severe symptomology rather than
exercise-induced adaptations that slow cancer progression.
Additionally, the time at which assessment of exercise levels
was conducted may contribute considerably to reverse cau-
sality; studies that assessed exercise levels during treatment
and/or close to the end of treatment may be particularly sus-
ceptible to reverse causality. Furthermore, changes in other
health behaviors or variation in clinical factors over the
follow-up period may have influenced the observed associa-
tions. Considerable heterogeneity exists in the participant
characteristics, study designs, follow-up periods, assessment
tools, analysis techniques, and subsequent findings of the
individual studies and meta-analyses contained within this

 review. Although robust adjustments were typically factored
into analyses, the potential impact of confounding by
unmeasured factors and/or residual confounding cannot be
excluded. Additionally, bias may be introduced by the use of
self-report exercise behavior assessment techniques that are
prone to measurement error. Interpretation of information
arising from the summary of meta-analyses is limited by the
fact that these meta-analyses are at times based on the same
original data (Tables 2 and 3; Web Tables 4 and 5) and do
not always represent independent patient populations.
Managing treatment-related adverse effects
To assist with interpreting the results reviewed herein in a
manner intended to be useful to clinicians, policy makers,
and patients, we have created 2 tables that summarize the
findings (Tables 4 and 5). The first, most obvious observa-
tion in summarizing the results on treatment-related adverse
effects is that there are many understudied tumor sites. Every
site other than breast cancer is understudied. However, stud-
ies of the benefits of exercise on adverse treatment effects
are particularly scarce among head and neck, hematological,
gynecological, colon, and lung cancers. The extent to which
it is safe and appropriate to extrapolate results from studies
of patients with other tumor types is unknown. That said, in
the absence of significant risk, there is sufficient evidence
that exercise is of general health value and that it could do
more harm than good to wait to prescribe exercise to these
less studied populations until further research is complete.
Our review included a review of RCTs for outcomes for
which there were no meta-analyses, including breast cancer
treatment symptoms; sexual, bone, and cognitive health;
bladder and bowel health; anemia; and hot flashes. Results
from studies examining the effects of exercise interventions
on these outcomes are insufficiently consistent to warrant
any policy statements overall or for any particular tumor site.
Further research is needed to examine the effects of exercise
on treatment symptoms; bone, cognitive, and sexual health;
bladder and bowel health; hot flashes; and anemia. A limita-
tion of this conclusion is that this review collates trials that
were conducted both during and posttreatment. For some
outcomes, a lack of detrimental change/maintenance of cur-
rent condition might be the best possible outcome during
treatment (e.g., maintenance of sexual well-being during
prostate cancer treatment). There may be specific elements
of exercise interventions that need to be examined more fully
to discern the outcome. For example, there are 2 randomized
trials in which bone health outcomes are significantly
improved after an intervention that includes impact exercises
to load the bones (65, 66, 68). Further research is warranted
to discern whether focusing on impact exercise would make
the results of exercise interventions on bone health outcomes
more consistently positive.
For the outcomes examined more thoroughly in prior stud-
ies and for which there are recent meta-analyses, there are 2
outcomes with particularly strong evidence. These include
fatigue and psychosocial distress. This is consistent with the
National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines for
managing fatigue, which recommend exercise as the number
1 approach for managing cancer-related fatigue (130). For
physical function, sleep, body image, and physical health, the
majority of the meta-analyses conclude that there is a positive
effect of exercise, but that the number of studies or meta-
analyses is less compelling than for fatigue or psychosocial
distress. Finally, it is of interest that this review cannot con-
clude that exercise has a significant effect on quality of life,
given that prior reviews have concluded otherwise. One
possible explanation for this observation could be that the
studies in tumor types other than breast were small and
underpowered. Clearly, sample sizes of the individual
studies, as well as varying intensity and quality of exercise
interventions, could have influenced study results and our
subsequent interpretation.
Another important adverse effect of cancer therapies is
cardiotoxicity (131). Breast cancer patients are more likely
to die of heart disease than of breast cancer after 9 years of
survivorship (132). RCTs to prevent, attenuate, or reverse
the cardiotoxic effect of cancer treatments and to prevent
cardiovascular mortality are sorely needed.
Implications on policy and practice
The review of scientific evidence on the effectiveness of
exercise interventions to prevent recurrence and to improve
adverse effects of cancer treatments has implications for policy
and practice. A range of organizations has endorsed exercise
guidelines for people with cancer, including the American
Cancer Society, National Comprehensive Cancer Network,
American Society of Clinical Oncology, American College of
Sports Medicine, Exercise and Sports Science Australia, and
British Association of Sport and Exercise Science (133–138).
These guidelines largely mirror general exercise guidelines for
healthy adults, recommending that people with cancer avoid
inactivity and participate in regular, moderate-intensity aerobic
and resistance exercise. The guidelines also stipulate exercise
programming adaptations based on cancer and treatment-
related adverse effects. Despite these recommendations, the
majority of people diagnosed with cancer are not sufficiently
active, and it is anticipated that most patients do not participate
in the high-quality exercise programs that are observed to elicit
significant benefit (139–141). Thus, there is great potential to
improve outcomes for patients and potentially to reduce health
system expenditure (i.e., reduce the need to manage/treat some
adverse treatment-related effects) through improved imple-
mentation of exercise within cancer care. To realize this poten-
tial, strategies to further develop policy and practice beyond
the general exercise guidelines currently available are required.
There is solid evidence that exercise is an effective treatment
for cancer-related fatigue during and after treatment and for a
broad variety of cancer types. Given that cancer-related fatigue
is ubiquitous during treatment and can persist long term in a
subset of patients (142), the practice of clinical oncology
should include recommendations for exercise during and after
treatment. There are already policies in place on this topic,
most notably the guidelines for managing fatigue from the
National Comprehensive Cancer Network in the United States
(130). Similarly, the evidence for the effectiveness of exercise
for improving psychosocial outcomes is also clear and consis-
tent. There is a requirement of the American College of Sur-
geons Commission on Cancer accreditation that psychosocial

 distress be evaluated often among cancer patients (143). Fur-
ther, if the results of that evaluation indicate the need for inter-
vention, there must be a referral to effective treatment. Despite
this, there are no policies, guidelines, or statements of major
national organizations that point to exercise as a means of
improving psychosocial outcomes. This could be low hanging
fruit for organizations that produce such statements and poli-
cies, including the National Comprehensive Cancer Network,
the American Cancer Society, and the Clinical Oncology Soci-
ety of Australia. Given the increasing research efforts in the
field, such statements should be refined and updated as the evi-
dence base grows. Notably, the implementation of such poli-
cies and enacting on calls within position statements will need
to occur to increase access to exercise advice and programs
within cancer care.
Conclusions
Findings of this comprehensive review support the view
that exercise is an important adjunct therapy for the manage-
ment of cancer. A considerable body of literature now exists
that provides convincing evidence of the beneficial impact of
exercise on disease and patient outcomes. However, these
data need to be interpreted carefully as considerable heteroge-
neity exists in the nature and quality of study designs, inter-
ventions, assessments, and subsequent findings. Despite
existing limitations, the evidence to date substantiates recom-
mendations for people with cancer to avoid inactivity and to
engage in regular exercise. This includes participating in mod-
erate to vigorous intensity aerobic and resistance exercise as
endorsed by leading international organizations (133–135,
137, 138). For the potential of exercise to be realized, consid-
erable effort and efficient investment are required to
strengthen evidence-based policy and practice. Effectively
implementing exercise within the cancer treatment paradigm
is likely to contribute to a reduction in the burden of cancer.
