Description: The American Diabetes Association (ADA) annu-
ally updates Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes to provide
clinicians, patients, researchers, payers, and other interested par-
ties with evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis
and management of patients with diabetes.
Methods: For the 2017 Standards of Care, the ADA Professional
Practice Committee did MEDLINE searches from 1 January 2016
to November 2016 to add, clarify, or revise recommendations on
the basis of new evidence. The committee rated the recommen-
dations as A, B, or C, depending on the quality of evidence, or E
for expert consensus or clinical experience. The Standards of
Care were reviewed and approved by the Executive Committee
of the ADA Board of Directors, which includes health care pro-
fessionals, scientists, and laypersons. Feedback from the larger
clinical community informed revisions.
Recommendation: This synopsis focuses on recommendations
from the 2017 Standards of Care about monitoring and
pharmacologic approaches to glycemic management for type 1
diabetes.

T
he American Diabetes Association (ADA) first re-
leased its practice guidelines for health profession-
als in 1989. The Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes
have since provided an extensive set of evidence-
based recommendations that are updated annually for
the diagnosis and management of patients with diabe-
tes. The 2017 Standards of Care cover all aspects of
patient care (1); this guideline synopsis focuses on
monitoring and pharmacologic approaches for patients
with type 1 diabetes.
GUIDELINE DEVELOPMENT AND EVIDENCE
GRADING
To develop the 2017 Standards of Care, the
ADA Professional Practice Committee systematically
searched MEDLINE from 1 January 2016 (date of pre-
vious search) to November 2016. Recommendations
were revised on the basis of new evidence or, in some
cases, to clarify prior recommendations or match the
strength of the wording to the strength of the evidence.
The Professional Practice Committee comprises physi-
cians, including both adult and pediatric endocrinolo-
gists; diabetes educators; registered dietitians; epide-
miologists; public health experts; and others who have
expertise in areas relevant to the Standards of Care.
This group also solicited feedback from the larger clin-
ical community.
The recommendations are rated as A, B, C, or E
depending on the quality of evidence. Those with an A
rating are based on large, well-designed, multicenter
clinical trials or well-done meta-analyses. Recommen-
dations with lower-quality evidence may be equally im-
portant and are based on well-conducted cohort stud-
ies (B rating) or uncontrolled studies (C rating). Those
assigned an E rating are consensus recommendations
for which no evidence has been derived from clinical
trials, in which clinical trials may be impractical, or that
have conflicting evidence.
The ADA funds development of the Standards of
Care from its general revenues and has no industry
support or involvement. Details about the methodol-
ogy, information on committee members and their

MONITORING GLYCEMIA IN TYPE 1 DIABETES
Self-Monitoring Blood Glucose:
Recommendations
Most patients receiving intensive insulin regimens
(multiple daily injections [MDI] or continuous subcuta-
neous insulin infusion [CSII] therapy using an insulin
pump) should self-monitor blood glucose before meals
and snacks, at bedtime, occasionally after meals, when
they suspect low blood glucose, after treating low
blood glucose until they are normoglycemic, and be-
fore exercise and critical tasks like driving (B rating).
When prescribed self-monitoring of blood glucose
(SMBG), patients must receive ongoing instruction and
regular evaluation of technique, results, and ability to
use SMBG data to adjust therapy (E rating).
Major clinical trials of glycemic control in type 1
diabetes have included SMBG as an integral part of the
multifactorial interventions (2), and in both clinical trials
and observational studies, frequent SMBG is associated
with lower hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels (3). Accuracy
depends on the instrument and user, so providers must
evaluate each patient'
s technique, both initially and at
regular intervals thereafter. Many patients with type 1

 diabetes require testing 6 to 10 (or more) times daily,
although individual needs may vary. The frequency of
SMBG should be reevaluated at each routine visit to
avoid overuse (4–6).
Continuous Glucose Monitoring:
Recommendations
When used properly, continuous glucose monitor-
ing (CGM), in conjunction with intensive insulin regi-
mens, is a useful tool to lower HbA1c levels in selected
adults (aged ≥25 years) with type 1 diabetes (A rating).
It may benefit those with hypoglycemia unawareness
or frequent hypoglycemic episodes (C rating). When
prescribing CGM, a clinician must provide robust dia-
betes education, training, and support for optimal
CGM implementation and ongoing use (E rating). Pa-
tients who have been using CGM successfully should
have continued access after they turn 65 years of age (E
rating).
Continuous glucose monitoring measures intersti-
tial glucose (which is correlated with plasma glucose)
and includes sophisticated alarms that the user can in-
dividualize to identify hypoglycemic and hyperglyce-
mic excursions. Continuous glucose monitors require
regular calibration with SMBG, and with most CGM de-
vices, treatment decisions are still based on SMBG. The
greatest predictor of HbA1c lowering with CGM for all
age groups is frequency of sensor use (7, 8). A registry
study of 17 317 patients confirmed that more frequent
CGM use is associated with lower HbA1c levels (9).
Small, short-term, randomized controlled trials in adults
and children with baseline HbA1c levels less than 7.0%
to 7.5% have also shown less frequent hypoglycemia
and an increased likelihood of maintaining HbA1c levels
less than 7% (10–12). Because of variable adherence,
optimal CGM requires an assessment of individual
readiness to use the technology as well as initial and
ongoing education and support (9, 13).
HbA1c: Recommendations
Hemoglobin A1c should be tested at least twice per
year in patients who are meeting treatment goals (and
who have stable glycemic control) (E rating) and quar-
terly in those whose therapy has changed or who are
not meeting glycemic goals (E rating). Point-of-care
testing for HbA1c allows more timely treatment changes
(E rating).
Hemoglobin A1c reflects average glycemia over ap-
proximately 3 months and has strong predictive value
for diabetes complications (14, 15). Measurement every
3 months in patients with type 1 diabetes determines
whether glycemic targets have been reached and
maintained. It may also confirm the accuracy of the pa-
tient'
s meter (or their reported CGM or SMBG results)
and adequacy of the testing schedule. Hemoglobin A1c
does not measure glycemic variability or hypoglycemia.
In type 1 diabetes, glycemic control is best evaluated
using the results of CGM, SMBG, and HbA1c testing.
Avoiding hypoglycemia should always take prece-
dence over achieving HbA1c targets. The HbA1c level is
an indirect measure of glycemia and may not accurately
measure average glycemia in persons with increased
turnover of red blood cells. This possibility must be
considered when the HbA1c level does not correlate to
the patient'
s CGM- or SMBG-measured glucose levels.
Other measures of average glycemia, such as fruc-
tosamine and 1,5-anhydroglucitol levels, might be
helpful, but their prognostic significance is not as clear.
GLYCEMIC GOALS: RECOMMENDATIONS
A reasonable HbA1c goal for many nonpregnant
adults is less than 7% (A rating). Providers might sug-
gest more stringent HbA1c goals (such as <6.5%) for
selected individuals if this can be achieved without clin-
ically significant hypoglycemia or other adverse effects.
Appropriate patients might include those with short du-
ration of diabetes, long life expectancy, or no clinically
significant cardiovascular disease (C rating). Less strin-
gent HbA1c goals (such as <8%) may be appropriate for
patients with a history of severe hypoglycemia, limited
life expectancy, advanced microvascular or macrovas-
cular complications, extensive comorbid conditions, or
long-standing diabetes, in whom the goal is difficult to
achieve despite diabetes self-management education,
appropriate glucose monitoring, and intensive insulin
therapy (B rating).
The DCCT (Diabetes Control and Complications
Trial) (2), a prospective randomized controlled clinical
trial of intensive versus standard glycemic control in pa-
tients with type 1 diabetes, showed that near-normal
glycemic control is associated with decreased rates of
development and progression of microvascular (reti-
nopathy [16] and diabetic kidney disease) and neuro-
pathic complications. Follow-up of the DCCT cohorts in
the EDIC (Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and
Complications) study (17) found persistence of these
microvascular benefits, despite the glycemic separation
between treatment groups diminishing and disappear-
ing during follow-up. Results from the DCCT showed a
lower risk for cardiovascular events with intensive ther-
apy, although that finding was not statistically signifi-
cant. In the 9-year post-DCCT follow-up of the EDIC
cohort, participants previously assigned to intensive
therapy had a 57% reduction in risk for nonfatal myo-
cardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death com-
pared with those previously assigned to standard ther-
apy (18). The benefit of intensive glycemic control in
this cohort has been shown to persist for several de-
cades (19) and to be associated with a modest reduc-
tion in all-cause mortality (20).
PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY FOR TYPE 1
DIABETES: RECOMMENDATIONS
Most patients with type 1 diabetes should be
treated with MDI of both prandial and basal insulin or
with CSII (A rating). Most should use rapid-acting insu-
lin analogues to reduce hypoglycemia risk (A rating).
Consider educating persons with type 1 diabetes on
matching prandial insulin doses to carbohydrate intake,
premeal blood glucose levels, and anticipated physical
activity (E rating). Patients who have been using CSII

 successfully should have continued access after they
turn 65 years of age (E rating).
Insulin Therapy
Insulin is the basis of therapy for type 1 diabetes
(Table 1) (21–23). The starting total daily insulin dose is
typically weight-based, ranging from 0.4 to 1.0 units/kg
of body weight. A typical total daily starting dose in
patients who are metabolically stable is 0.5 units/kg.
Higher weight-based starting doses may be needed for
patients who present with diabetic ketoacidosis. Higher
insulin doses are often required during puberty. The
ADA Position Statement on type 1 diabetes manage-
ment through the life span provides a thorough over-
view of type 1 diabetes treatment and associated rec-
ommendations (24).
Education about matching prandial insulin dosing
to carbohydrate intake, premeal glucose levels, and an-
ticipated physical activity should be considered, and
persons who have mastered carbohydrate counting
should be educated on fat and protein gram estimation
(25–27). Although most studies of MDI versus CSII have
been small and of short duration, a systematic review
and meta-analysis concluded that the 2 forms of inten-
sive insulin therapy differed slightly in HbA1c levels
(combined mean between-group difference favoring
CSII, �0.30 percentage point [95% CI, �0.58 to �0.02
percentage point]) and severe hypoglycemia rates in
children and adults (28). Intensive management using
CSII and CGM should be encouraged in those with ac-
tive patient and family participation (29–31). A hybrid
closed-loop insulin pump and CGM system (MiniMed
670G Insulin Pump System [Medtronic]) than can auto-
matically adjust basal insulin rates on the basis of blood
glucose values is now available in the United States,
and more are expected to be approved in the next few
years.
The DCCT demonstrated that intensive therapy
with MDI or CSII delivered by a multidisciplinary
team improved glucose control and resulted in better
long-term outcomes (2, 18, 32). However, despite bet-
ter microvascular, macrovascular, and all-cause mortal-
ity
outcomes,
intensive
therapy
with
short-
and
intermediate-acting human insulin was associated with
a high rate of severe hypoglycemia (61 episodes per
100 patient-years of therapy). Rapid-acting and long-
acting insulin analogues developed since the DCCT are
associated with less hypoglycemia in type 1 diabetes
and match the HbA1c improvements obtained with hu-
man insulins (33, 34).
The ideal time to administer premeal insulin varies
with the type of insulin used (such as regular, rapid-
acting analogue, and inhaled), measured blood glu-
cose level, timing of meals, and carbohydrate con-
sumption. Therefore, the timing of premeal insulin
administration should be individualized.
Rapid-acting inhaled insulin dosed before meals in
patients with type 1 diabetes was shown to be noninfe-
rior to aspart insulin with respect to HbA1c lowering.
Less hypoglycemia was seen with inhaled insulin ther-
apy (35). Inhaled insulin cartridges are available only in
4-, 8-, and 12-unit doses, so persons with type 1 diabe-
tes may have limited ability to fine-tune premeal insulin
doses when using this approach.
Other Treatments
Although insulin is clearly the mainstay of treat-
ment for patients with type 1 diabetes, many other
treatments are being used or investigated. Pramlintide
is an injectable amylin analogue that is indicated as an
adjunct to mealtime insulin for patients with type 1 di-
abetes who have not achieved blood glucose goals af-
ter optimizing insulin therapy. Pramlintide delays gas-
tric emptying, blunts pancreatic secretion of glucagon,
and enhances satiety. If pramlintide is used, prandial
insulin dosing should be reduced to minimize the risk
for severe hypoglycemia.
Pancreas transplantation has been shown to nor-
malize blood glucose control in type 1 diabetes but
requires lifelong immunosuppression and thus is gen-
erally reserved for patients who are also having renal
transplantation or those with recurrent ketoacidosis or
severe hypoglycemia despite intensive glycemic man-
agement. Islet transplantation remains investigational.
Investigational Agents
Many agents generally used for type 2 diabetes
(not currently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Ad-
ministration for type 1 diabetes) are being studied.
Metformin, when added to insulin therapy, was not
found to lower HbA1c levels in patients with poorly con-
trolled type 1 diabetes (absolute HbA1c reduction, 0.11
percentage point; P = 0.42) but did reduce insulin re-
quirements (reduction, 6.6 units/d; P < 0.001) and led
to small reductions in weight and total and low-density
lipoprotein cholesterol (36). Glucagon-like peptide-1–
receptor agonists and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors
are also being studied in patients with type 1 diabetes.
The glucagon-like peptide-1–receptor agonist liraglu-
tide showed benefit in patients with type 1 diabetes
over a 52-week period but was associated with in-
creased adverse events. The trial included 1398 adults
with type 1 diabetes who were randomly assigned to

 receive once-daily injections of liraglutide (1.8, 1.2, or
0.6 mg) or placebo added to insulin therapy. Hemoglo-
bin A1c levels improved by 0.34 to 0.54 percentage
point from a mean baseline of 8.2% and improved sig-
nificantly more with 1.8 or 1.2 mg of liraglutide than
placebo. Body weight reduction was 2.2 to 4.9 kg
greater with liraglutide than placebo. However, hypo-
glycemia rates increased by 20% to 30%, and hypergly-
cemia with ketosis was 2.2 times more likely at the
higher 1.8-mg/d dosage (37). The sodium–glucose
cotransporter-2 inhibitors provide insulin-independent
glucose lowering by blocking glucose reabsorption in
the proximal renal tubule. They also promote weight
loss and lowering of blood pressure. In May 2015, the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a warning
that sodium–glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors may
lead to ketoacidosis occurring in the absence of signif-
icant hyperglycemia, termed “euglycemic diabetic ke-
toacidosis.” If patients develop symptoms of ketoacido-
sis, which may include dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, and
abdominal pain, they should stop taking sodium–glu-
cose cotransporter-2 inhibitors and seek medical atten-
tion immediately (38).
Hypoglycemia: Recommendations
Patients with type 1 diabetes should be asked
about symptomatic and asymptomatic hypoglycemia at
each encounter (C rating). Glucose (15 to 20 g) is the
preferred treatment for conscious persons with hypo-
glycemia (glucose alert value of ≤3.9 mmol/L [70 mg/
dL]), although any form of carbohydrate that contains
glucose may be used. If SMBG shows continued hypo-
glycemia 15 minutes after treatment, it should be re-
peated. Once CGM or SMBG values return to normal,
the person should consume a meal or snack to prevent
recurrence (E rating). Glucagon should be prescribed
for all patients at increased risk for clinically significant
hypoglycemia, defined as blood glucose less than 3.0
mmol/L (54 mg/dL), so that it is available if needed.
Glucagon administration is not limited to health care
professionals (E rating); thus, caregivers, school per-
sonnel, and family members should know where the
glucagon is stored and when and how to administer it.
Insulin-treated patients with hypoglycemia unaware-
ness or an episode of clinically significant hypoglyce-
mia should be advised to raise their glycemic targets to
strictly avoid hypoglycemia for at least several weeks.
This should partially reverse hypoglycemia unaware-
ness and reduce the risk for future episodes (A rating).
Hypoglycemia is the major limiting factor in the gly-
cemic management of patients with type 1 diabetes. A
classification scheme proposed by the International Hy-
poglycaemia Study Group is outlined in Table 2. Symp-
toms of hypoglycemia can include shakiness, irritability,
confusion, tachycardia, and hunger. Patients with re-
peated episodes of hypoglycemia may develop hypo-
glycemia unawareness. Severe hypoglycemia can prog-
ress to loss of consciousness, seizure, coma, or death.
Hypoglycemia is reversed by administration of rapid-
acting glucose or glucagon. Clinically significant hypo-
glycemia can result in acute harm to the patient and
others, especially if it causes falls or motor vehicle acci-
dents. Prevention is critical for type 1 diabetes manage-
ment. Self-monitoring of blood glucose and, for some
patients, CGM are important tools to monitor glucose
levels and prevent hypoglycemia. Patients should be
educated about times when they may be at increased
risk for hypoglycemia, such as while fasting for tests,
with delayed meals, during or after exercise, and dur-
ing sleep. Hypoglycemia episodes may be particularly
dangerous while driving, and some patients may ben-
efit from having a glucose meter and rapid-acting glu-
cose treatment in the car if needed.
Glucagon is indicated for the treatment of hypogly-
cemia in patients unable or unwilling to consume car-
bohydrates by mouth. Those in close contact with a
patient who has type 1 diabetes, such as family mem-
bers, roommates, school personnel, child care provid-
ers, correctional institution staff, or coworkers, should
be instructed on the safe use of glucagon kits in case of
an emergency.
