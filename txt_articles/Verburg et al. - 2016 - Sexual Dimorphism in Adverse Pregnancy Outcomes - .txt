Abstract
Objectives
Sexual inequality starts in utero. The contribution of biological sex to the developmental ori-
gins of health and disease is increasingly recognized. The aim of this study was to assess
and interpret sexual dimorphisms for three major adverse pregnancy outcomes which affect
the health of the neonate, child and potentially adult.
Methods
Retrospective population-based study of 574,358 South Australian singleton live births dur-
ing 1981–2011. The incidence of three major adverse pregnancy outcomes [preterm birth
(PTB), pregnancy induced hypertensive disorders (PIHD) and gestational diabetes mellitus
(GDM)] in relation to fetal sex was compared according to traditional and fetus-at-risk (FAR)
approaches.
Results
The traditional approach showed male predominance for PTB [20–24 weeks: Relative Risk
(RR) M/F 1.351, 95%-CI 1.274–1.445], spontaneous PTB [25–29 weeks: RR M/F 1.118,
95%-CI 1.044–1.197%], GDM [RR M/F 1.042, 95%-CI 1.011–1.074], overall PIHD [RR M/F
1.053, 95%-CI 1.034–1.072] and PIHD with term birth [RR M/F 1.074, 95%-CI 1.044–
1.105]. The FAR approach showed that males were at increased risk for PTB [20–24
weeks: RR M/F 1.273, 95%-CI 1.087–1.490], for spontaneous PTB [25–29 weeks: RR M/F
1.269, 95%-CI 1.143–1.410] and PIHD with term birth [RR M/F 1.074, 95%-CI 1.044–
1.105%]. The traditional approach demonstrated female predominance for iatrogenic PTB
[25–29 weeks: RR M/F 0.857, 95%-CI 0.780–0.941] and PIHD associated with PTB [25–29
weeks: RR M/F 0.686, 95%-CI 0.581–0.811]. The FAR approach showed that females were
at increased risk for PIHD with PTB [25–29 weeks: RR M/F 0.779, 95%-CI 0.648–0.937].

 Conclusions
This study confirms the presence of sexual dimorphisms and presents a coherent frame-
work based on two analytical approaches to assess and interpret the sexual dimorphisms
for major adverse pregnancy outcomes. The mechanisms by which these occur remain elu-
sive, but sex differences in placental gene expression and function are likely to play a key
role. Further research on sex differences in placental function and maternal adaptation to
pregnancy is required to delineate the causal molecular mechanisms in sex-specific preg-
nancy outcome. Identifying these mechanisms may inform fetal sex specific tailored antena-
tal and neonatal care.
Introduction
The foundation for the health of children and both women and men is established during intra-
uterine life when the fetus is said to be programmed by the intrauterine environment. The
“developmental origins of health and disease” hypothesis indicates long-term health conse-
quences for individuals with a low birth weight[1].
Adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as preterm birth (PTB), pregnancy induced hypertensive
disorders (PIHD) and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) do not only have an immense influ-
ence on the mother, but also on the baby. Pregnancy complications are associated with impaired
development of the fetus, neonate and infant. Both women who had preeclampsia and the
babies born to them are at increased risk for later adult onset diseases such as hypertension, car-
diovascular disease and type 2 diabetes[2]. Preterm born babies are more likely to die or suffer
significant long-term health problems including cerebral palsy, vision impairment and lung dis-
ease[3]. Offspring from mothers with GDM are at increased risk of developing obesity, impaired
glucose tolerance, Type 2 Diabetes and cardio-vascular disease in adulthood[4].
The National Institutes of Health (NIH) recently highlighted the importance of evaluating the
sex differences in health and disease. This forms one of the main goals of the NIH strategic plan
‘Moving into the Future with New Dimensions and Strategies for Women’s Health Research: A
Vision for Women’s Health Research’ (http://orwh.od.nih.gov/research/priorities.asp).
Adverse pregnancy outcomes are heterogeneous conditions and their pathophysiology is
not fully understood. During the last few decades interest has grown in identifying risk factors
for adverse pregnancy outcome to help understand the underlying mechanisms and potentially
prevent them in the future. Several themes have emerged, including the importance of the pla-
centa and the presence of sexual dimorphism in progression and development of child and
adult diseases.
It has been suggested that male fetal sex is an independent risk factor for adverse pregnancy
outcome and that female fetuses have an advantage over male fetuses[5]. Several studies have
found an association between male fetal sex and excess perinatal mortality and morbidity[6–
13]. Women carrying a male fetus appear to be at an increased risk for PIHD[7,8,10,13], PTB
[6–8,10,12–15] and GDM[10,13,15].
However, the literature is not consistent. Although spontaneous PTB is more prevalent in
male fetuses, iatrogenic PTB is more prevalent in female foetuses[8,11,12]. Also, some studies
suggest that preeclampsia complicated with PTB is more prevalent in female foetuses[7–10].
And, some recent studies found no sexual dimorphism for overall PIHD[10,12,13,15], for
PIHD complicated by PTB[13], nor for GDM[12].

Competing Interests: The authors have declared
that no competing interests exist.
 Incidence, prevalence, pathophysiology and health outcomes for a number of common dis-
eases are different between the sexes. Sex inequality starts in utero and the contribution of bio-
logical sex to the”developmental origins of health” and disease is increasingly recognized[1].
In neonatal and pediatric care, studies have shown sex specific differences in the response to
maternal conditions, such as asthma[16] and to antenatal glucocorticoid treatment for women
with threatened preterm birth[17,18].
Also, sex differences in lung development, disease course and response to treatment have
been well documented[19]. These differences are present as early as 16–24 weeks of gestation.
Females have a lower number of bronchioles compared with males, but females mature faster.
Also, surfactant is produced earlier in gestation by females compared to males. In neonates,
females have higher expiratory flow rates corrected for size compared to males and this differ-
ence remains present throughout the life span[19]. Childhood lung conditions, such as asthma,
atopy and allergic rhinitis are more common in boys versus girls[20]. A number of intrinsic
and environmental risk factors for asthma are known, but early life events, such as preterm
birth, may contribute.
Traditionally, population studies have determined the incidence and therefore risk of a peri-
natal outcome, as the number of cases in a certain gestation group divided by the number of
births at that gestation[7,21] or divided by all births in the population[6,8–10,12,13,15]. Other
studies have used variations on this approach[11,22,23].
However, the incidence of any pregnancy related event at any gestation is defined as the
number of new cases of the event that occurs within that gestational week divided by the
number of candidates at risk for the event at that gestation[24].Therefore, the so-called
“fetuses-at-risk” (FAR) approach has been suggested for use in perinatal research[24,25].
This approach identifies fetuses as the candidates at risk for perinatal events rather than neo-
nates. Similar to a survival analysis it takes into account the remaining fetuses at risk such
that as gestation proceeds and babies are born preterm, only outcomes for the remaining
fetuses are analysed. Therefore, it is thought that the FAR approach may provide more
insight into the causal links between length of gestation and perinatal outcomes. The FAR
approach is recognized and accepted in the literature for stillbirth, but to our knowledge
this approach has not been used in studies on sexual dimorphism in perinatal outcome
before[24].
By using a well-curated Australian database, this study aims to present both traditional and
FAR approaches to analysis providing a coherent framework to assess and interpret the sexual
dimorphism for three major adverse perinatal outcomes.
Materials and Methods
Study population
This retrospective population-based cohort study included all singleton live births in South
Australia (SA), Australia, between January 1981 and December 2011, recorded in the South
Australian Perinatal Statistics Collection (SAPSC) maintained by the Pregnancy Outcome Unit
(POU) of SA Health. The SAPSC collects information regarding the characteristics and out-
come of all births with a gestation of 20–42 weeks and a birth weight � 400 grams in South
Australia, notified by hospital and homebirth midwives and neonatal nurses using a standard-
ised Supplementary Birth Record (SBR).
Gestational age was based on dating ultrasound (performed at 8–13 weeks gestation) sup-
ported by the first day of the last menstrual period or by review of other ultrasonography and
reported as completed weeks.

 Study Outcomes
The studied maternal variables were age, parity, gravidity and ethnicity. The neonatal variables
included infant sex, birth weight, gestational age at birth, and pregnancy outcome, defined as
PTB, PIHD and GDM.
Analyses were performed on six gestational age categories, as defined in a previous large Nor-
wegian population study[7] with four PTB categories (20–24, 25–29, 30–33 and 34–36 weeks),
and two term categories (37–39 and 40–42 weeks). Spontaneous birth was defined as birth without
any pharmacological, surgical or other intervention undertaken to stimulate the onset of labour.
Iatrogenic preterm birth was defined as preterm induction of birth and/or caesarean section due
to other pregnancy morbidities, mainly preeclampsia or intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR).
PIHD was defined as blood pressure � 140/90 on two occasions at least four hours apart,
or � 170/110 on one occasion, ± proteinuria. GDM was listed in the SAPSC when the clinician
documented that the woman had GDM based on the criteria of the hospital or laboratory
where the test was performed. Routine glucose challenge testing for GDM was introduced in
SA in the early 1980’s. GDM defined as a fasting glucose � 5.5. mmol/L and /or 2hr value � 8
mmol/L was uniformly reported from 1987. For the analyses of GDM, all births recorded
between 1987 and 2011 were used.
Statistical Analyses
Data analysis was performed with SPSS version 21.0 (SPSS inc., 2013). The Student t-test was
used to compare continuous variables, and χ2-test was used for categorical variables. Differ-
ences were considered significant when the p-value was less than 0.05.
Sexual dimorphisms in adverse pregnancy outcomes were calculated according to two
approaches as defined by Joseph[24] (Fig 1). The traditional approach employs the incidence
of births with the adverse pregnancy outcome divided by the number of births at that gestation.
The FAR approach employs the incidence of births with the adverse pregnancy outcome
divided by the number of fetuses at risk of birth at that gestation. Fetal sex ratios in both
approaches were calculated as relative risks for males versus females (RR M/F). 95% Confi-
dence Intervals (95%-CI) were tabulated to demonstrate variability of the estimate.
Ethical approval
The Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC) of the South Australian Department of
Health [HREC/13/SAH/97] approved the study protocol. The existence of personal identifying
information in the SAPSC was eliminated to ensure that confidentially of all patient records
was maintained.
Results
Of a total of 596,600 births recorded in the SAPSC during the study period, 574,358 (96.3%)
births were eligible for the study, including 295,724 (51.5%) male and 278,634 (48.5%) female
neonates. The overall M/F-ratio was 1.06. The demographics and obstetric characteristics are
presented in Table 1. There were no significant differences between the groups regarding
maternal age, parity, gravidity, and ethnicity. Overall, male fetuses had a lower mean gesta-
tional age at birth (p <0.001) and a higher mean birth weight (p <0.001).
Preterm birth
The sexual dimorphism for length of gestation is shown in Table 2 and Fig 2. The traditional
approach showed a male predominance for PTB [RR M/F 1.351, 95%-CI 1.274–1.445 (20–24

 weeks)] and term birth [RR 1.052, 95%-CI 1.051–1.054 (37–39 weeks)]. The FAR approach
showed an increased risk of PTB in women carrying a male fetus [RR M/F 1.273, 95%-CI
1.087–1.490 (20–24 weeks)]. At term unity in RR M/F was reached.
Spontaneous preterm birth. The traditional approach showed a male predominance for
spontaneous PTB [RR M/F 1.118, 95%-CI 1.044–1.197 (25–29 weeks)] (Table 3 and Fig 3). At
term, a “cross-over” was observed. In the gestation category 37–39 weeks spontaneous birth
showed a male predominance (RR M/F 1.025, 95%-CI 1.018–1.033), whereas spontaneous
birth was more prevalent in female bearing pregnancies between 40–42 weeks gestation (RR
M/F 0.989, 95%-CI 0.985–0.994).

hypothetical pregnancies. Traditional approach: Number of affected births in a gestational group divided by the number of total
births within that gestation group = 1/3. Fetuses at risk approach: Number of affected births at gestational group divided by the number
of fetuses at risk for a disease at that gestation group = 1/5. Modified after Joseph et al(24).

 Using the FAR approach, males were at increased risk for spontaneous PTB [RR M/F 1.269,
95%-CI 1.143–1.410 (25–29 weeks)]. At term a “cross-over” was observed and male fetuses
were at increased risk for spontaneous birth between 37–39 weeks (RR M/F 1.023, 95%-CI
1.013–1.033), whereas female fetuses were at increased at risk for spontaneous birth between
40–42 weeks (RR M/F 0.989, 95%-CI 0.985–0.994).

 Iatrogenic preterm birth.
The traditional approach observed a female predominance for
iatrogenic PTB [RR M/F 0.857, 95%-CI 0.780–0.941 (25–29 weeks)] (Table 4 and Fig 4). At
term, a “cross-over” was observed. In the gestation category 37–39 weeks iatrogenic birth
showed a female predominance (RR M/F 0.969, 95%-CI 0.960–0.978), whereas in the 40–42
gestation group, iatrogenic birth was more prevalent in male bearing pregnancies (RR M/F
1.022, 95%-CI 1.012–1.032).
The FAR approach showed that iatrogenic PTB had a pattern close to unity. At term, a
‘cross-over’ was observed. Females were at increased risk for iatrogenic birth at 37–39 weeks
gestation [RR M/F 0.967, 95%-CI 0.956–0.978], whereas males were at increased risk for iatro-
genic birth at 40–42 weeks [RR M/F 1.022, 95%-CI 1.012–1.032].
Pregnancy Induced Hypertensive Disorders and Gestational Diabetes
Mellitus
The rates for hypertensive disorders and diabetes are shown in Table 5. There were no signifi-
cant differences between the groups regarding pre-gestational diabetes and chronic hyperten-
sion. GDM showed a male predominance (RR M/F 1.042, 95%-CI 1.011–1.074) and overall
PIHD showed a male predominance (RR M/F 1.053, 95%-CI 1.034–1.072).
In the traditional approach, PIHD associated with PTB showed a female predominance [RR
M/F 0.686, 95%-CI 0.581–0.811 (25–29 weeks)], while PIHD associated with term birth was
more prevalent in males [RR M/F 1.074, 95%-CI 1.044–1.105 (40–42 weeks)] (Table 6 and Fig
5). Using the FAR approach, female fetuses were at increased risk for PIHD associated with

 very PTB [RR M/F 0.779, 95%-CI 0.648–0.937 (25–29 weeks)]. Male fetuses were at increased
risk for PIHD associated with term birth [1.074, 95%-CI 1.044–1.105 (40–42 weeks)].
Discussion
This large 30-year South Australian population study confirms the presence of clear sexual
dimorphisms for PTB, PIHD and GDM.
Sexual dimorphisms
Preterm birth.
Both the traditional and the FAR approaches demonstrated a male pre-
dominance for all PTB. The traditional approach showed that, of all births at 20–24 weeks ges-
tation, PTB was 35.1% more common in male-bearing pregnancies. The FAR approach
showed that, of all ongoing pregnancies at 20–24 weeks gestation, the male-bearing pregnan-
cies were at 27.3% increased risk for PTB.
Both the traditional and the FAR-approaches also showed a male predominance for sponta-
neous PTB. The traditional approach showed that of all births at 25–29 weeks gestation, sponta-
neous PTB was 11.8% more common in male-bearing pregnancies. The FAR approach showed
that of all ongoing pregnancies at 25–29 weeks gestation the male-bearing pregnancies were at
26.9% increased risk of a spontaneous PTB at 25–29 weeks gestation. The pattern for iatrogenic
PTB was not as consistent between approaches. The traditional approach showed that of all
births at 25–29 weeks gestation, iatrogenic PTB was 14.3% more common in female-bearing
pregnancies. In contrast, the FAR approach showed that of all ongoing pregnancies at 25–29
weeks gestation the risk of iatrogenic PTB at 25–29 weeks gestation was equal in both sexes.
The male predominance for spontaneous PTB was observed in previous relatively small
studies[8,11,12] and the female predominance for iatrogenic PTB was observed in two of these
studies[8,11].

 The observation that using the FAR approach the risk for iatrogenic PTB was equal for both
sexes at this gestation suggests that the susceptible male fetuses were lost earlier in pregnancy
and therefore were lost to the analysis in subsequent gestation groups, hence elevating the pro-
portion of females remaining at this stage of gestation.
A higher male/female ratio for PTB was previously described in both large population stud-
ies[6,7,9,21], and in relatively smaller studies[8,10–13]. A pronounced male predominance has

 also been documented in pregnancy losses occurring before 20 weeks gestation where the over-
all sex-ratio was 1.25, with the highest male excess in first trimester losses (sex-ratio 2.00–2.50)
[22]. Interestingly, in this particular study, in the first trimester, fetuses with normal chromo-
somal morphology showed a sex-ratio of 1.50–1.80[22]. We observed that fetuses were at great-
est risk for birth, prior to the age of viability (<24 weeks) if they were male. This was of a
similar magnitude reported in the study by Byrne and Warburton[22].
Pregnancy Induced Hypertensive Disorders.
Overall PIHD showed a male predomi-
nance. Previous studies have shown conflicting results. The majority of previous studies docu-
mented no sexual dimorphism for overall PIHD[10,12,13,15], whereas others documented a
female predominance[23] or similar results to our study[7,9]. Some[7–10], but not all, studies
[12,13,15] distinguished between PIHD resulting in PTB and PIHD resulting in term birth.
The reason the female predominance disappears in the overall PIHD group, is most likely
because the vast majority of PIHD is at term.
Both traditional and FAR approaches demonstrated that female fetuses showed a higher
incidence of PIHD associated with PTB. The traditional approach showed that of all births at
25–29 weeks gestation, pregnancies complicated by PIHD were 31.4% more common in
female-bearing pregnancies. The FAR approach showed that of all ongoing pregnancies at 25–
29 weeks gestation, female-bearing pregnancies were at 22.1% increased risk of PIHD. In addi-
tion, male fetuses showed a higher prevalence and an increased risk for PIHD with term birth.
Interestingly, the “cross-over” from female to male predominance in both approaches was dif-
ferent, suggesting that fetal sex may not be a risk factor for PIHD resulting in birth between 30
and 36 weeks of gestation.
Gestational Diabetes Mellitus.
Women were at increased risk for GDM when carrying a
male fetus. Previous studies have shown conflicting results. A relatively small study found no
sexual dimorphism for GDM[12], while another study showed a greater maternal insulin

 resistance in female bearing pregnancies[26] and others reported similar findings to those for
this cohort[10,13,15].
Biology
The mechanisms by which sexual dimorphisms in PTB, PIHD, and GDM occur are unclear.
Pregnancy is a physiological challenge for both mother and fetus. By secreting a number of
hormones and growth factors into the maternal circulation, the placenta largely orchestrates
maternal adaptations to pregnancy that result in markedly enhanced function of all her organs
including kidneys, liver and cardiovascular system. These adaptations enable provision of an
optimal environment for the fetus to grow and develop. However, they can unmask women
already at cardiovascular and metabolic risk and compromise their and their babies’ health in
the short and long terms[27]. Clifton presented a summary of several sex-specific strategies by
which the fetus copes with adversity in utero[28]. Male and female fetuses adapt differently to
developmental stressors and sex steroids have a profound influence on the development and
progression of developmentally programmed disease states[1,28]. It is thought that the pla-
centa plays an important role in obstetric complications, including PTB[28–30], PIHD
[28,29,31] and GDM[28,32]. Placental gene expression in normal male versus female bearing
pregnancies at term is significantly different[33] and may also be different in those with a preg-
nancy complication.
Preterm birth. Defective trophoblast invasion and colonization of the uterine spiral arteri-
oles has been associated with a number of obstetrical complications, including PTB[29].

 Incomplete remodeling of the spiral arterioles, a lesion classically associated with preeclampisa
and IUGR, is also present in many cases of PTB[29]. Placentation is controlled, in part, by
maternal-fetal immune interactions[34] and normal pregnancy is known to be an inflamma-
tory state. In preterm birth before 32 weeks, male fetal sex has been associated with an increase
in placental lesions, suggestive of a more aggressive maternal immune response against the
invading interstitial trophoblast[30]. The interstitial trophoblast and maternal decidua are the
most affected tissues, suggesting a local inflammatory response induced by the maternal
immune system[35]. This aggressive maternal immune response could explain the male excess
in spontaneous PTB but the exact mechanisms are unknown.
Pregnancy Induced Hypertensive Disorders.
Defective placental invasion has also been
associated with preeclampsia[29,34]. In general, in preeclampsia, remodeling of the utero-pla-
cental spiral arterioles fails mainly in the myometrial segments. In preeclampsia with intrauter-
ine growth restriction the failure of myometrial segment remodeling is often associated with
occlusive arterial lesions[29].
The “cross-over” in the sexual dimorphism for PIHD by length of gestation we have
observed in our study was different for each analytic approach. According to the FAR
approach, fetal sex was not a risk factor for PIHD resulting in birth between 30 and 36 weeks of
gestation unlike observed sex-dependent early-onset and late-onset PIHD.
Most previous placenta studies have failed to consider sex bias in placental differentiation
and function. Sex biases include different expression of genes, proteins and steroid pathways in
response to an adverse maternal environment, including maternal asthma and preeclampsia
[28]. In an adverse maternal environment the male fetus maintains his growth trajectory plac-
ing him at risk of PTB or stillbirth if an additional insult occurs. The female fetus adapts to an
adverse maternal environment by slowing her growth trajectory. This allows her to survive if
an additional insult occurs[28]. Also, since induction of labour is the only remedy for severe
preeclampsia, the female predominance of iatrogenic PTB suggests that female fetuses are
somehow able to induce hypertension in their mothers who suffer more severe PIHD than
women carrying male fetuses. In response to adversity, the female feto-placental-unit may be
able to increase maternal blood pressure and thereby improve placental perfusion pressure
with the attendant maternal risk of PIHD. However, we are yet to understand how the female
feto-placental unit can raise maternal blood pressure in mid gestation relatively more than that
of the male.
We have recently shown in a meta-analysis of studies of genome-wide placental gene
expression that there are 142 genes that are differentially expressed between placentas from
male and female bearing non-pathological term pregnancies, with 75 genes more highly
expressed in female placentas and 67 genes more highly expressed in male placentas. Genes
were autosomal (60%), X-linked, as well as some Y chromosome genes[33]. The sex-specific
differences in the placental transcriptome may explain sex differences in placental function,
length of gestation and pregnancy outcomes.
An alternative explanation for the female excess in PIHD associated with PTB is a theory
based on the influence of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Circulating hCG is more
abundant in pregnancies with preeclampsia[8], and high concentrations in the second and
third trimesters have been associated with an increased risk for preeclampsia[36]. Interestingly,
high concentrations of free β-hCG in the mother have also been associated with female fetal
sex[37]. Furthermore, our meta-analysis of placental microarray data found that the CGB clus-
ter of genes that encode β-hCG, are also more highly expressed in female placentas than in
male placentas in uncomplicated pregnancies[33].
Gestational Diabetes Mellitus.
Differences in the levels of steroid hormones in male and
female fetuses may be expected to alter placental and fetal gene expression. This could also

 contribute to sex differences in fetal growth. Interestingly, sex differences in gene expression,
glucose uptake, and metabolism are already apparent in embryos from as early as the 8-cell to
blastocyst stages, long before the gonads differentiate[38]. At birth, cord arterial blood glucose
levels are significantly higher in males than in females[21]. This is consistent with the view that
male fetuses grow more rapidly and invest as little as possible in placental growth, while female
fetuses invest in placental growth to protect them from a potentially poor maternal environ-
ment. The male growth strategy places males at greater risk in adversity[28,32]. Although insu-
lin resistance is a feature of normal pregnancy[39], the male placenta may cause the mother to
become relatively more insulin resistant and in association with other factors, this may increase
the risk of GDM and macrosomia in male bearing pregnancies. However, if this is the case it is
yet to be determined.
Despite the compelling findings of the current study, much remains unclear regarding the
impact of biological sex on mechanisms underlying developmentally programmed responses[1].
The Different Approaches to Analysis
The ambiguity in the results from other studies of sexual dimorphism of pregnancy outcomes
compared to this study is mostly due to methodological differences, which this study aimed to
address by using both traditional and FAR approaches.
The traditional approach is considered to be a descriptive approach towards perinatal out-
come, since it assesses the relative difference in proportion of a perinatal event at a certain ges-
tation compared to all the births at that gestation[24]. A disadvantage of the traditional
approach is that it does not take into account that it is also the unborn fetuses that are at risk
for the pregnancy outcome at a particular time in gestation. The FAR approach identifies
fetuses as the candidates at risk for perinatal events. Therefore, it is thought that the FAR
approach gives more insight into the causal links between length of gestation and perinatal out-
comes[24].
In our opinion, both approaches are useful for perinatal research but it has to be clear that
they measure different things. The traditional approach is suited for setting prognosis from
early gestation and provides population prevalence, while the FAR approach provides a causal
framework and the basis for obstetric intervention.
Strengths and limitations
With 574,359 analysed births, this study is one of the largest to date on sexual dimorphism in
pregnancy outcomes. The major strength of this type of population-based study lies in the
unbiased statistical power that it provides.
As this was a retrospective design, we could only use variables that were included in the
dataset. PIHD included both gestational hypertension and preeclampsia, as data on proteinuria
were not collected by the SAPSC. It is however reasonable to assume that PIHD leading to
(mostly iatrogenic) PTB would reflect preeclampsia. That is, the observed female predomi-
nance in PIHD with PTB likely reflects female predominance in preterm preeclampsia associ-
ated with labour induction.
Routine glucose challenge testing was introduced in South Australia in the early 1980s.
GDM was uniformly reported from 1987 and therefore we were able to report data for a signifi-
cant length of time. We are of course aware that there have been recent changes to the criteria
for diagnosis of GDM as recommended by WHO that will increase the number of women diag-
nosed[40].
The SAPSC utilises notifications of births in South Australia made by hospital and home-
birth midwives and hospital neonatal nurses on the SBR. The SBRs are checked manually for

 completeness and data discrepancies and go through a series of automated validation proce-
dures during data entry. Validation studies by the SAPSC have shown that notifications of all
births in South Australia on the SBR were robust for the parameters studied[41]. The subjects
analysed in this study could therefore be considered as a true representation of the South Aus-
tralian and Australian population.
Conclusion and Future Directions
This large population based dataset covering 30 years of births in South Australia confirms the
presence of marked sexual dimorphisms for PTB, PIHD, and GDM. We report that women
carrying a male fetus are at increased risk for all PTB, spontaneous PTB, overall PIHD and
GDM. Women carrying a female fetus are more at risk for PIHD complicated with PTB. Most
interestingly, male fetuses show a 27% increased risk for extreme early PTB (20–24 weeks).
Female fetuses have a 22% increased risk for PIHD complicated by PTB (25–29 weeks). In a
clinical setting, fetal sex is important in determining the obstetric risks for pregnant women
and perinatal outcomes for infants.
This study suggests that fetal sex should be taken into account in further studies on obstetric
complications and their mechanisms. Further research on sex differences in placental function
and maternal adaptation to pregnancy is required to delineate the causal molecular mecha-
nisms in sex-specific pregnancy outcome. Identifying these mechanisms may inform fetal sex
specific tailored antenatal care and infant care in the neonatal nursery and on into childhood.
