Abstract
Background and objectives The relationship between HDL cholesterol and all-cause mortality in patients with
kidney disease is not clear. We sought to characterize the relationship of HDL cholesterol and risk of death and
examine the association by eGFR levels.
Design, setting, participants, & measurements We built a cohort of 1,764,986 men who were United States
veterans with at least one eGFR between October of 2003 and September of 2004 and followed them until
September of 2013 or death.
Results Patients with low HDL cholesterol and low eGFR had a higher burden of comorbid illnesses. Over a
median of 9.1 years (interquartile range, 7.7–9.4 years), 26,247 (40.1%), 109,222 (32.3%), 152,625 (29.2%), 113,785
(28.5%), and 139,803 (31.8%) participants with HDL cholesterol #25, .25 to ,34, $34 to #42, .42 to ,50, and
$50 mg/dl died. In adjusted survival models, compared with the referent group of patients with low HDL
cholesterol (#25 mg/dl), intermediate HDL cholesterol levels (.25 to ,34, $34 to #42, and .42 to ,50 mg/dl)
were associated with lower risk of death across all levels of eGFR. The lower risk was partially abrogated in those
with high HDL cholesterol ($50 mg/dl), and the risk of death was similar to the referent category among those
with eGFR,30 or $90 ml/min per 1.73 m2. Analysis by HDL cholesterol deciles and spline analyses suggest that
the relationship between HDL cholesterol and death follows a U-shaped curve. There was a significant inter-
action between eGFR and HDL cholesterol in that lower eGFR attenuated the salutary association of HDL
cholesterol and risk of death (P for interaction ,0.01). Presence of coronary artery disease attenuated the lower
risk of high HDL cholesterol and all-cause mortality in those with eGFR$60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 (P for interaction
,0.05).
Conclusions Our results show a U-shaped relationship between HDL cholesterol and risk of all-cause mortality
across all eGFR categories. The risk is modified by eGFR and cardiovascular disease.

Introduction
Few studies have evaluated the association between
HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) and mortality in patients
with kidney disease. Results from numerous experi-
mental and translational studies suggest that, in
addition to a relative quantitative HDL-C deficiency,
HDL-C antioxidant, anti–inflammatory, and antia-
therogenic properties are qualitatively impaired in pa-
tients with ESRD on dialysis (1,2). HDL-C obtained
from patients with CKD promoted endothelial super-
oxide production, reduced nitric oxide bioavailability,
and increased arterial BP (3). Reduced HDL-C levels
or altered functions resulted in reduced or impaired
cellular cholesterol efflux and may partly explain the
increased cardiovascular disease burden and excess
mortality risk in patients with CKD (4).
Zewinger et al. (5) evaluated the relationship of
HDL-C and mortality in a cohort of 3307 patients un-
dergoing coronary angioplasty and found that higher
HDL-C was not associated with reduced mortality in
patients with eGFR,60 ml/min per 1.73 m2. The
study cohort was comprised of referred patients
with a large burden of coronary artery disease
(CAD; 77.9%). Lamprea-Montealegre et al. (6) evalu-
ated the association between plasma lipids—and of
relevance here, HDL-C—and subclinical atherosclero-
sis measured by the common carotid intima-media
thickness in a cross-sectional study involving 6752
participants. The investigators found that higher
HDL-C was associated with lower intima-media
thickness and that this association was more pro-
nounced in patients with eGFR,60 ml/min per
1.73 m2 (6).
Observations from clinical literature are inconsis-
tent largely because of the short duration of follow-up
and often, very small sample size (7–9). Whether
higher HDL-C is associated with reduced risk of mor-
tality in patients with CKD and whether eGFR mod-
ifies the association of HDL-C and risk of death are
not clear. Furthermore, the cardiovascular disease
burden in people with kidney disease is significant;
whether the presence of cardiovascular disease

 modifies the relationship of HDL-C and risk of all-cause
mortality has not been examined in large–scale epidemio-
logic studies spanning a sufficiently prolonged duration of
time (10,11).
Here, we built a cohort of 1,764,986 men who were
United States veterans and followed them over a median of
9.1 years (interquartile range [IQR], 7.7–9.4 years) to ex-
amine the association of HDL-C and all-cause mortality on
the basis of eGFR levels, determine whether eGFR mod-
ifies this association, and examine whether the presence of
cardiovascular disease modifies the relationship between
HDL-C and risk of death.
Materials and Methods
Patients
Using administrative data from the US Department of
Veterans Affairs (VA), we identified users of the VA Health-
care System who had at least one eGFR value between
October 1, 2003 and September 30, 2004 with no prior
history of ESRD, dialysis, or kidney transplant
(n=2,751,717); the date of last eGFR during this period
was designated as time 0 (T0). Cohort participants were
additionally selected for having a complete lipid panel
between October 1, 1999 and T0 (n=2,233,536), having
serum albumin data (n=1,847,428), and being men
(n=1,764,986). The study was approved by the Institu-
tional Review Board of the VA St. Louis Health Care
System. A flow chart and timeline for cohort selection
are presented in Figure 1.
Data Sources
We used the Department of VA databases, including
outpatient and inpatient medical Statistical Analysis Sys-
tem (SAS) datasets, which include utilization information
consisting of all patient encounters within the VA system,
to ascertain detailed patient demographic characteristics
and comorbidity data on the basis of Current Procedural
Terminology (CPT) codes and International Classification
of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-
CM) diagnostic and procedure codes associated with
inpatient and outpatient encounters (12–15). The VA Man-
agerial Cost Accounting System Laboratory Results, a
comprehensive dataset that includes VA-wide results for
select laboratory tests obtained in the clinical setting, pro-
vided data on outpatient and inpatient serum creatinine,
HDL-C, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, serum albumin,
and microalbumin-to-creatinine ratio (12,13,16). The VA
Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW) Production Outpatient
Pharmacy domain provided information on statins,
angiotensin–converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), and
angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). The CDW Vital
Signs domain provided data on height and weight, which
was used to calculate body mass index (BMI) and body
surface area. The VA Vital Status and Beneficiary Identifi-
cation Records Locator Subsystem files provided

 demographic characteristics and death follow-up through
September 30, 2013 (12,13). The CDW Laboratory Chemistry
domain provided data on C-reactive protein (CRP). Data
were assessed from October 1, 1999 to September 30, 2013.
Primary Predictor Variable. The primary predictor vari-
able for all survival analyses was HDL-C level. The value
for HDL-C was taken as the outpatient HDL-C value before
and most proximal to T0. HDL-C was then categorized
using the following criteria (as outlined in the work by
Zewinger et al. [5]): #25, .25 to ,34, $34 to #42, .42
to ,50, and $50 mg/dl. For additional analysis of the re-
lationship of HDL-C and risk of death, values were also
categorized into deciles.
Outcomes. The primary outcome in survival analyses
consisted of time until death, with follow-up from time of
cohort entry (T0) until September 30, 2013.
Covariates
Baseline covariates were ascertained from October 1,
1999 until cohort entry (T0). Covariates included eGFR,
age, race, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, CAD, conges-
tive heart failure (CHF), peripheral artery disease, cancer,
cerebrovascular disease, chronic lung disease, hepatitis C,
HIV, dementia, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, serum albu-
min, ACEI/ARB use, statin use, BMI, body surface area,
microalbumin-to-creatinine ratio, and CRP. Race/ethnicity
was categorized as white, black, or other (Latino, Asian,
Native American, or other racial/ethnic minority groups).
T0 eGFR was categorized into groups as .90, 90 to ,60, 60
to ,45, 45 to ,30, and 30 to ,15 ml/min per 1.73 m2. To
minimize residual confounding, we also controlled for
eGFR within each eGFR category as a time-varying covar-
iate. Dialysis, kidney transplant status, and statin use were
also assessed as time varying. Microalbumin-to-creatinine
ratio was categorized into groups of ,20, 20 to ,300, and
$300 mg/g. BMI was categorized into underweight, nor-
mal weight, overweight, and obese categories. Body sur-
face area was calculated using the DuBois and DuBois
equation (17). Patients were considered ACEI or ARB
users if the total days of prescription during the period
before T0 was $90. Covariates were treated as continuous
variables where appropriate and unless otherwise indi-
cated. Comorbidities were assigned on the basis of rele-
vant ICD-9-CM diagnostic and procedures codes and CPT
codes in the VA Medical SAS datasets (18–22).
Statistical Analyses
Cox proportional hazard regression models were used in
the assessment of survival in the overall cohort and within
each eGFR category. The proportional hazard assumption
was assessed through use of log–negative log plots and
met. Multiple models were built to assess the relation be-
tween HDL-C level and the outcome while sequentially
controlling for different covariates. A bar chart showing
hazard ratios of the risk of all-cause mortality by HDL-C
levels grouped by eGFR category, with error bars repre-
senting 95% confidence intervals, is presented. Quadratic
spline analyses were performed in adjusted Cox propor-
tional hazard regression models to assess the relationship be-
tween HDL and risk of all-cause mortality within each eGFR
category and in the overall cohort (20). Knots were placed at
quintiles. To account for potential highly influential values,

 those with HDL-C values below the 1st percentile and above
the 99th percentile within each eGFR strata were excluded.
For all splines, an HDL-C value of 41 mg/dl, the median
value within the overall cohort, was used as the reference.
To assess potential effect modification of HDL-C level and
risk of death by eGFR category, an interaction term between
the two variables was added to a nonstratified model. The P
value for the type 3 test of the overall effect of the interaction
is presented. For assessment of potential effect modification
by cardiovascular disease, interaction terms between HDL-C
level and CAD, CHF, and a three–level cardiovascular dis-
ease variable (defined as neither CAD nor CHF, either CAD
or CHF, and both CAD and CHF) were added to separate
eGFR stratified models. In survival analyses, a 95% confi-
dence interval of a hazard ratio that does not include unity
was considered statistically significant. In all analyses, a P
value of #0.05 was considered statistically significant. Miss-
ing data were not imputed. All analyses were performed
and all graphs were made using SAS Enterprise Guide, ver-
sion 6.1 and SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).
Sensitivity Analyses
We evaluated the consistency of study findings by
undertaking a number of sensitivity analyses, where we
(1) conducted analyses in a separate cohort of women
(n=82,422), (2) examined the association in a subcohort

 where data on microalbumin-to-creatinine ratio were avail-
able (n=134,321), (3) additionally controlled for body surface
area, (4) additionally controlled for CRP in a subcohort where
data were available (n=65,112), and (5) also used different
cutoff points to define HDL-C categories, where HDL-C
was categorized into four groups: ,30, $30 to ,40, $40 to
,60, and $60 mg/dl (data not shown).
Results
The demographic and clinical characteristics of the
overall cohort (n=1,764,986) and according to HDL-C lev-
els are presented in Table 1; patients with lower HDL-C
had lower eGFR and higher burden of comorbid diseases.
Characteristics according to eGFR category are presented
in Supplemental Table 1; patients with low eGFR had
lower HDL-C and higher burden of comorbid illnesses.
Among cohort participants, 1,456,328 had more than one
HDL-C measure at or before T0, with a median number of
measures of 4 (IQR, 3–7) and a mean (SD) coefficient of
variation of 11.7% (7.0).
Association between HDL-C Levels and All-Cause Mortality
in Overall Cohort and by eGFR Category
During a median follow-up of 9.1 years (IQR, 7.7–9.4
years), 541,682 (30.7%) study participants died in the over-
all cohort; 26,247 (40.1%), 109,222 (32.3%), 152,625 (29.2%),
113,785 (28.5%), and 139,803 (31.8%) were in HDL-C#25,
.25 to ,34, $34 to #42, .42 to ,50, and $50 mg/dl
groups, respectively. In a series of nested models adjusting
for demographics, eGFR, comorbid conditions, lipid pa-
rameters, BMI, statins, serum albumin, ACEI/ARB use,
and cardiovascular disease, compared with the referent
group of patients with low HDL-C (#25 mg/dl), higher
HDL-C levels were associated with lower risk of all-cause
mortality in the overall cohort (Table 2). Compared with
the referent category (HDL-C#25 mg/dl), intermediate
HDL-C levels (.25 to ,34, $34 to #42, and .42 to
,50 mg/dl) exhibited reduced risk of death across all lev-
els of eGFR (Figure 2, Table 2). HDL-C$50 mg/dl was not
associated with reduced risk of all-cause mortality in the
lowest and highest eGFR categories (eGFR,30 and
$90 ml/min per 1.73 m2) (Table 2). Adjusted models of
all-cause mortality by HDL-C in each eGFR category are
presented in Table 2; the nested models are presented in
Supplemental Table 2. Formal interaction analyses were
undertaken and show a significant interaction between
eGFR category and HDL-C in that lower GFR modified
(attenuated) the salutary association of HDL-C and risk
of death (P for interaction ,0.01). However, even in the
lowest eGFR group, there was still a significant association
between HDL-C and risk of death in HDL-C groups with
.25 to ,34, $34 to #42, and .42 to ,50 mg/dl (Supple-
mental Table 3).
We then divided HDL-C into deciles and examined the
relationship of HDL-C and risk of death in each eGFR
category. In the overall cohort and compared with those in
the lowest decile (decile 1), higher deciles (deciles 2–9) were
associated with reduced risk of death, whereas decile 10
was associated with increased risk of death. In analyses by
eGFR categories, the results suggest that, compared with
the lowest HDL-C decile (decile 1), higher deciles (deciles

 2–7) have reduced risk of death in all eGFR categories.
Risk of death was increased in decile 10 among those
with eGFR,30, $60 to ,90, and $90 ml/min per
1.73 m2 (Table 3). However, in each eGFR category, the
risk was lowest in the middle deciles and highest in deciles
1 and 10. Spline analyses suggest that—in the overall co-
hort and all eGFR categories—the relationship between
HDL-C and mortality is not linear and exhibits a U-shaped
association, where risk is lowest in the middle and ele-
vated in low and high ends of HDL-C values spectrum
(Figure 3, Supplemental Figure 1).
Association between HDL-C Levels and All-Cause Mortality
Is Modified by Presence of Cardiovascular Disease
Formal interaction analyses were undertaken to examine
whether presence of cardiovascular disease modifies the
association of HDL-C and risk of death. The results suggest
that presence of CAD attenuated the lessened risk of high
HDL-C and all-cause mortality in those with eGFR$60 ml/min
per 1.73 m2 (Table 4). The magnitude and direction of risk
were modified by the presence of CAD in those with
eGFR$90 ml/min per 1.73 m2 and HDL-C$50 mg/dl
(Table 4). Interaction models, where we tested effect mod-
ification by the presence of CHF (Supplemental Table 4A),
the presence of either CAD or CHF, or both, yielded con-
sistent results (Supplemental Table 4B).
Sensitivity Analyses
We evaluated the consistency of study findings by
undertaking a number of sensitivity analyses as described
in Materials and Methods. The results were consistent with
those shown in the primary analyses (Supplemental Tables
5–8).
Discussion
In a longitudinal national cohort study of 1,764,986
United States veterans spanning almost a decade (median
follow-up of 9.1 years), we show that, compared with low
HDL-C (#25 mg/dl), intermediate HDL-C levels (HDL-C
between 25 and 50 mg/dl) were associated with reduced
risk of all-cause mortality and that risk of death in patients
with high HDL-C ($50 mg/dl) was comparable with that
of patients with low HDL-C (#25 mg/dl). Analyses where
HDL-C was categorized in deciles and spline analyses fur-
ther support the assessment that the association between
HDL-C and risk of death is not linear and follows a U-shaped
relationship (where risk is highest in those with very low
and very high HDL-C levels). Furthermore, we show that
risk is modified by eGFR and presence of cardiovascular
disease.
Zewinger et al. (5) studied the association of HDL-C and
mortality in a cohort of 3307 patients with significant bur-
den of CAD (77.9%) who underwent coronary angioplasty
and concluded that higher HDL-C was not associated with
reduced mortality in patients with kidney dysfunction
(eGFR,60 ml/min per 1.73 m2). Our results support a
more nuanced conclusion: specifically, the association be-
tween HDL-C and risk of death follows a U-shaped curve,
and lower eGFR attenuated the salutary effect of HDL-C;
however, the associations remained significant in patients

reference and the HDL-C probability distribution histogram is represented in gray bars in the background. Dashed red lines represent 95%

 with advanced kidney disease. We also show that presence
of cardiovascular disease attenuates the association of
HDL-C and all-cause mortality.
The observation that the association between HDL-C and
risk of death follows a U-shaped curve was not expected,
and the mechanism underpinning the association of high
HDL-C and mortality is not clear. Our study did not
examine the cause of death; however, we note that
prevalence of diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular
diseases was lower among those with high HDL-C,
suggesting perhaps that cardiovascular events are not likely
to explain the increased risk of death in this group. We also
note the slightly higher percentage of patients with cancer
and that average CRP was higher among those with high
HDL-C. Whether cancer or conditions associated with
increased CRP (infections and chronic inflammation) ex-
plain the increased risk of death among patients with high
HDL-C merits additional investigation.
Comparison of risk in high–HDL-C vis-à-vis low–HDL-C
groups, where the risk relationship might not be linear and
risk may be increased at both ends of the HDL-C values
spectrum, might mask the presence of an association where
one exists (23). Our results suggest that, regardless of eGFR
category, the lower risk of death associated with HDL-C
was most pronounced in the middle deciles and that risk
is elevated in lowest and highest deciles (a U-shaped rela-
tionship). These results reconcile with findings from recent
Mendelian randomization analyses showing that genetic
mechanisms that raise plasma HDL-C do not lower risk
of myocardial infarction (24). Experimental evidence sug-
gests that HDL-C may have a biphasic effect (at low and high
concentrations) and that, at high concentrations, HDL-C
paradoxically enhanced senescence and impaired endothelial
progenitor cell tube formation and angiogenesis, suggesting
loss of protective effect (25). Furthermore, pharmaceutic in-
tervention studies (those involving cholesterol ester transfer
protein inhibitors or niacin) aimed at increasing HDL-C lev-
els did not result in amelioration of cardiovascular outcomes
or mortality (26–28). The constellation of findings from these
studies supports the notion that there may be a range of
HDL-C values where HDL-C may have a salutary effect,
beyond which higher HDL-C may not be beneficial and
may be associated with untoward outcomes. Identification
of HDL-C levels where risk is highest (and the corollary iden-
tification of levels where risk is lowest) and which groups of
patients are most likely to favorably respond to interventions
aimed at increasing HDL-C levels may be useful in informing
patient selection, design, and implementation of such trials
and help develop a definitive answer to the question of
whether therapeutics aimed at ameliorating HDL-C levels
may improve clinical outcomes (29). The results from our
studies, however, also suggest that risk of death varies very
little for the vast majority of participants in this large cohort,
which highlights the challenge of identifying populations
where interventions might lead to amelioration of risk of
death and may limit the potential public health effect of po-
tential pharmaceutic interventions.
Our study has a number of limitations. Although our
study included data on HDL-C levels and other lipid
parameters, our data do not allow for qualitative assess-
ment of HDL-C size, composition, functional capacity, or
HDL-C subclasses (i.e., HDL2, which is generally associ-
ated with improved cardiovascular outcomes) (30,31).
Low HDL-C may be present in the context of increased

 oxidative stress, insulin resistance, poor physical activity,
smoking, and alcohol consumption. Our datasets did not
include information on these parameters. We also note
that there are significant baseline differences in demo-
graphic and health characteristics among cohort partici-
pants according to eGFR and HDL-C levels (Table 1,
Supplemental Table 1) and that those with low eGFR
and those with low HDL-C had much higher burden of
comorbid illnesses (Table 1, Supplemental Table 1); these
observations suggest that HDL-C is a heavily confounded
measure, which might challenge its validity as an indepen-
dent predictor of clinical outcomes. Additionally, although
we accounted for several known covariates in our models,
we cannot completely eliminate the possibility of residual
confounding, the notion that there might be factors, either
unmeasured or unknown, that might partially or fully ex-
plain the reported associations and that HDL-C may be
more of a surrogate marker rather than an independent
driver of clinical outcomes. Regardless, we show that
quantitative assessment of HDL-C informs risk of all-cause
mortality across levels of eGFR and by presence of cardio-
vascular disease. Our data did not include information on
the cause of mortality. The cohort consisted of mainly
older white men who were United States veterans and
sought and obtained care at the VA; thus, the observed
associations may not be generalizable to a broader popu-
lation. Additionally, cohort selection required participants
to have at least an eGFR, a complete lipid panel, and se-
rum albumin to qualify for cohort entry, and as such, this
might represent a selection bias. The nature of administra-
tive data and the retrospective design of the study may
also lead to sampling bias, errors in measurement, and
misclassification of exposure or predictor variables. To
minimize such measurement bias, we used definitions
that have been validated for use in VA administrative
data. We performed a number of sensitivity analyses,
where we tested robustness of findings to changes in ep-
idemiologic design and specification of statistical models,
and the results were consistent.
