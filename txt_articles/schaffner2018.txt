ABSTRACT
Concern has been raised regarding the public health risks from refillable bulk-soap dispensers because they provide an
environment for potentially pathogenic bacteria to grow. This study surveyed the microbial quality of open refillable bulk soap in
four different food establishment types in three states. Two hundred ninety-six samples of bulk soap were collected from food
service establishments in Arizona, New Jersey, and Ohio. Samples were tested for total heterotrophic viable bacteria,
Pseudomonas, coliforms and Escherichia coli, and Salmonella. Bacteria were screened for antibiotic resistance. The pH, solids
content, and water activity of all soap samples were measured. Samples were assayed for the presence of the common
antibacterial agents triclosan and parachlorometaxylenol. More than 85% of the soap samples tested contained no detectable
microorganisms, but when a sample contained any detectable microorganisms, it was most likely contaminated at a very high
level (~7 log CFU/mL). Microorganisms detected in contaminated soap included Klebsiella oxytoca, Serratia liquefaciens,
Shigella sonnei, Enterobacter gergoviae, Serratia odorifera, and Enterobacter cloacae. Twenty-three samples contained
antibiotic-resistant organisms, some of which were resistant to two or more antibiotics. Every sample containing less than 4%
solids had some detectable level of bacteria, whereas no samples with greater than 14% solids had detectable bacteria. This
finding suggests the use of dilution and/or low-cost formulations as a cause of bacterial growth. There was a statistically
significant difference (P ¼ 0.0035) between the fraction of bacteria-positive samples with no detected antimicrobial agent (17%)
and those containing an antimicrobial agent (7%). Fast food operations and grocery stores were more likely to have detectable
bacteria in bulk-soap samples compared with convenience stores (P , 0.05). Our findings underscore the risk to public health
from use of refillable bulk-soap dispensers in food service establishments.
Key words: Bulk soap; Coliforms; Contamination; Hand washing
Washing hands with soap and water is a universally
accepted practice to reduce cross-contamination and the
incidence of nosocomial infections (9, 12–14, 16, 18, 20, 26,
29, 33). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the
U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and
the World Health Organization (WHO) suggest proper hand
hygiene with soap and water and/or an alcohol-based hand
sanitizer in health care and food preparation settings (3, 35,
39). The CDC and WHO recommend alcohol-based hand
sanitizer as the primary means for hand hygiene at key
moments in health care settings (3, 31, 39), whereas food
handling guidance from FDA (35) supports gloving or hand
washing for primary prevention. The respective hand
hygiene guidance documents from these three public health
agencies all have language that indicates that a hand wash is
not complete without the use of soap (3, 35, 39). However,
concern has been raised that the use of refillable bulk-soap
dispensers is a public health risk because they provide an
environment for potentially pathogenic bacteria to grow,
especially if the bulk soap is diluted with water to reduce
cost (8, 21, 25, 30, 40).
Outbreaks associated with contaminated soap have been
extensively documented in health care settings (1, 2, 5, 24,
27, 30, 38), but none to date have been connected to food
service settings. Organisms found in bulk soaps are
primarily gram-negative bacteria (8), and these bacteria
include microorganisms that are commonly associated with
nosocomial infection in hospitals (3, 19). Klebsiella
pneumonia, a bacterium associated with contaminated bulk
soaps, can cause community-acquired pneumonia; proper
hand hygiene is a good way of preventing cross-contami-
nation by these bacteria because health care workers’ hands
can be vectors for these organisms (7). Outbreaks of Serratia
marcescens have also been traced to contaminated soap (2,
5, 27, 30, 37). Although no outbreaks in food service have
been directly linked to contaminated bulk-soap dispensers,
roughly 50% of food service–linked outbreaks can be traced
to food workers’ hands as the source of pathogens (16).

 sterile, good manufacturing practices for soaps and cosmet-
ics require that any bacteria present should not constitute a
hazard to consumers during regular use (32).
Several factors contribute to bulk-soap contamination,
including design of dispenser, soap formulation, and
economically motivated dilution of soap (5, 25). To refill
sealed dispensers, new cartridges, which contain soap sealed
inside with a new nozzle, are placed into the dispenser; in
contrast, open refillable bulk-soap dispensers reuse a
permanent nozzle and are refilled with soap from a larger
bottle. A top-fill reservoir design allows for ‘‘topping-off’’
the soap. Although this potentially reduces soap waste, it
also allows mixing of multiple soap lots and types and
exposes the soap to an open-air environment, which
increases the risk of contamination (3, 25, 40). Furthermore,
top-fill design dispensers may never thoroughly be rinsed
out, as commonly recommended by dispenser manufactur-
ers. The CDC recommends that bulk liquid soap dispensers
be thoroughly cleaned every time before fresh soap is added
(3, 8, 14). However, as pointed out by Lorenz et al. (21), no
data exist to show that cleanings in between soap refills
actually prevent contamination of soap. Regardless, bulk
soap can quickly become contaminated due to biofilm
formation inside the dispenser (up to 9 log CFU/mL) and
can support growth in as little as 24 h (25). Once pump
mechanisms are colonized with bacteria, cells from the
biofilm continue to contaminate soap, even if completely
new bacteria-free soap is used to fill the container (15). Soap
formulations will often include preservatives to prevent
growth, but because these preservatives are concentration
dependent, dilution (as a cost savings measure) can render
them ineffective. There has been no evidence of contami-
nation in soap samples collected from dispensers in sealed
disposable refills to date.
Potentially harmful bacteria will remain on hands after
using contaminated soap (8, 30, 40). Although the bacteria
may not be a health concern for the hand washer, these
bacteria can transfer from hands to food, objects, and
surfaces (6, 9, 12, 13, 16, 17, 22, 29). Hands are one of the
main sources of cross-contamination in both health care and
food service (12, 20).
The purpose of this study was to survey the microbial
quality of open refillable bulk soap sampled in four different
food establishment types, within three different states, and to
determine the influence of formulation factors on the degree
of contamination.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Sample collection. Samples were acquired from food service
establishments around New Brunswick, NJ; Tucson, AZ; and
Akron, OH. The categories of merchants from which soap samples
were collected were convenience stores, grocery stores, ‘‘sit-down’’
restaurants, and fast food (quick-service) restaurants. Categories
were sampled based on the prevalence of the types of
establishment in each area and on the likelihood of finding bulk
soap in the establishment. Soap was collected from the bathrooms
of these establishments. Men’s and women’s restrooms were
sampled in approximately equal frequency. Although soap color
was noted, no attempt was made to sample specific colors.
Samples were shipped to the University of Arizona for
microbiological analysis, and to GOJO Industries, Inc. (Akron,
OH) for physical and chemical analysis. One hundred samples each
were collected from Arizona and New Jersey, and 96 samples were
collected from Ohio.
Soap samples were collected in a 50-mL sterile conical tube
(Corning, Union City, CA), with a minimum volume goal of 45
mL. Two tubes of soap were collected from most establishments,
except in a few instances in which a facility only had enough soap
for one tube. Soap was collected in the tube by catching the soap
released when the dispenser lever was pressed. We used this
method to ensure that the soap collected was representative of what
would be dispensed onto a customer’s hands. Foaming soap was
not sampled because bulk refillable foam soap dispensers are
uncommon, and challenges in collecting an adequate mass of
foaming soap made sampling impractical. Samples were sealed
using parafilm (Bemis NA, Neenah, WI) and were placed in an ice
pack–chilled cooler after collection.
Microbiological analysis. Total heterotrophic viable bacteria
were assayed on Reasoner’s 2A agar (R2A; EMD Chemicals, Inc.,
Gibbstown, NJ), using serial dilutions of 10�1 through 10�3 of the
soap samples, with colonies counted after 5 days of incubation at
22 6 28C. R2A agar was originally developed as a rapid method
for fecal coliforms in water (28); however, since its development, it
has been used in a wide variety of applications, including screening
of bulk soap for contaminants (8) because it may be especially
suitable for culturing slower growing organisms from stressed
environments (36). Colonies of the three most predominant
morphologies were streaked onto plates of Trypticase soy agar
(TSA; EMD Chemicals, Inc.) for isolation and identification. R2A
plates were also examined for the presence of Pseudomonas, which
was then isolated and confirmed.
Coliforms and E. coli were quantified using the IDEXX
Quanti-Tray/2000 system (IDEXX Laboratories, Westbrook, MA).
A 10-mL aliquot of the sample was added to 90 mL of sterile water
containing the Quanti-Tray reagent, poured into the Quanti-Tray,
and then sealed and incubated at 358C for 24 h. Coliforms were
identified by yellow pigmentation and E. coli by fluorescence
under UV light. The number of positive yellow and fluorescing
wells were quantified, and the IDEXX most-probable-number
(MPN) generator program was used for quantification.
Randomly selected coliform-positive wells from the IDEXX
Colilert Quanti-Tray/2000 (IDEXX Laboratories) were spread
plated on MacConkey agar (EMD Chemicals, Inc.) to select for
lactose fermenters. These isolates were then spread plated to TSA
(EMD Chemicals, Inc.) and subjected to an oxidase test (BD,
Sparks, MD) and API 20E identification biochemical test strips
(bioM´
erieux, Durham, NC) for confirmation as coliforms. Twenty-
eight isolates were identified as coliforms and tested for antibiotic
resistance by placing antibiotic disks for vancomycin, ampicillin,
gentamicin, and ciprofloxacin (Sigma Chemical, St. Louis, MO)
onto bacterial lawns of the individual bacteria.
Salmonella preenrichment started by placing a 5-mL aliquot
of the soap sample into a tube that contained 10 mL of tryptic soy
broth (TSB; EMD), followed by incubation at 358C for 24 h. After
24 h, 1 mL of the TSB was transferred to a tube that contained 10
mL of Rappaport-Vassiliadis broth (Hardy Diagnostics, Santa
Maria, CA), followed by incubation at 41.58C for 24 h. One
milliliter of TSB was also added to a tube that contained 10 mL of
selenite cystine broth (EMD Chemicals, Inc.) and was incubated at
35.08C for 24 h. Each tube showing turbidity was streaked onto
plates of Hektoen (EMD Chemicals, Inc.) and xylose lysine
desoxycholate (XLD; EMD Chemicals, Inc.) agars and incubated

 at 358C for 24 h. Presumptive Salmonella isolates were transferred
to TSA for biochemical identification using the API 20E
(bioM´
erieux). If the isolate was presumptively identified as
Salmonella, the isolated colonies were sent to the National
Veterinary Services Laboratories (Ames, IA) for serotyping.
pH and water activity. The pH of all samples was evaluated
using a Thermo Orion 720AþpH with the Thermo Scientific Orion
ROSS Sure-Flow pH electrode (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
Pittsburgh, PA). Five grams of each test sample was evaluated
using the Ohaus standard moisture analyzer (model MB45, Ohaus,
Pine Brook, NJ).
A water activity meter (Rotronic Instrument Corp.,
Hauppauge, NY) was used to measure the water activity of soap
samples. Distilled water and glycerol solutions were used as
standards. Each sample cup was filled with about 10 mL of soap
sample, and after 4 to 5 min the temperature and water activity
were recorded. The sample cup was rinsed using distilled water and
was dried completely using a Kimwipe (Kimberly-Clark, New
York, NY) after each test.
Antimicrobial analysis. All samples were evaluated for the
presence and quantity of triclosan using the Waters (Milford, MA)
e2695 Alliance high-performance liquid chromatography system
with a UV/Visible Detector (Waters 2489) and a Waters
lBondapak C18 column (125 ˚
A, 10 lm, 3.9 by 150 mm; Waters
no. WAT086684). All samples that tested negative for the presence
of triclosan were evaluated for the presence and quantity of
parachlorometaxylenol, using the same system, detector, and
column as used for triclosan.
RESULTS
Most of the soap samples tested (.85%) contained no
detectable microorganisms (10 CFU/mL detection limit).
The distribution of microbial counts found in contaminated
soap samples is shown in Figure 1. Samples containing
detectable microorganisms were most often contaminated at
a very high level (~7 log CFU/mL), with counts on the
remaining samples ranging uniformly from 1 to 6 log CFU/
mL. Although not all bacteria recovered were identified,
microorganisms detected in contaminated soap included
Klebsiella oxytoca, Serratia liquefaciens, Shigella sonnei,
Enterobacter gergoviae, Serratia odorifera, and Enterobac-
ter cloacae. Four of the soap samples were positive for
Salmonella by API 20E, but were not confirmed as
Salmonella by the National Veterinary Services Laborato-
ries. Twenty-three samples contained vancomycin-resistant
organisms. Seven of these were also resistant to ampicillin,
and two of those, in turn, were resistant to gentamicin. One
sample contained an organism resistant to vancomycin,
ampicillin, gentamicin, and ciprofloxacin (antibiotic resis-
tance data not shown).
When a sample contained detectable coliforms, simi-
larly, the population was likely to be high, as shown in
Figure 2. The distribution of coliforms is likely higher than
what is shown in Figure 2, because the two highest
populations were at the upper limit of quantification (i.e.,
.241,960 MPN/mL or .24,196 MPN/mL).
Figure 3 shows that higher coliform counts tended to be
associated with samples that contained higher bacterial
counts overall. Coliform counts at the upper limits of the
MPN method are especially associated with high total
bacterial counts.
Figure 4 shows the relationship between sample pH and
the population of detectable microorganisms. Of samples
with a pH less than 7.0, 18% had detectable contamination,
whereas only 10% of samples with a pH of 7 and above had
detectable contamination. Note, however, that contaminated
soap samples with a pH �7.0 are more likely to result in
contamination at a relatively higher level (i.e., .1,000 CFU/
mL), perhaps because pH influences bacterial growth or
survival.
Figure 5 shows the relationship between the measured
percent solids (top panel) or water activity (bottom panel) of
a sample and the bacterial count. Note that every sample
containing less than 4% solids had some detectable level of
bacteria, whereas only two samples with greater than 14%
solids had detectable bacteria. A similar pattern is shown
with water activity (Fig. 5, bottom panel), and samples with
water activities between 0.99 and 1.0 were associated with a
range of bacterial populations, including the highest
populations observed. As the measured water activity

 decreased, the occurrence of higher bacterial populations
declined, although there was a low population of bacteria in
the soap with the lowest water activity measured. There was
no clear relationship between the solids content and the
water activity (data not shown).
Figure 6 expands upon the analysis of the relationships
between percent solids (top panel) or water activity (bottom
panel) and bacterial count. As percent solids increases, the
fraction of samples with a bacterial count above the
detection limit (10 CFU/mL) decreases (Fig. 6, top panel).
Note that the two leftmost bars in the figure are associated
with very few observations (three and six observations,
respectively), whereas all other points are always associated
with 30 or more observations. The bottom panel of Figure 6
shows the number of samples associated with different water
activities, with the number of samples generally decreasing
as water activity increases. The number of contaminated
(gray) versus uncontaminated (black) samples are shown by
shading on the bars. Clearly the greatest number, as well as
the greatest fraction, of samples containing detectable
bacteria is associated with higher (0.99 to 1.00) water
activities, although even soaps with lower water activity can
also contain detectable bacteria.
Figure 7 shows the relationship between the measured
population of antimicrobial agent in the soap and the
bacterial count. Samples containing no detected antimicro-
bial agent have widely distributed contamination levels.
Although samples containing triclosan were contaminated
regardless of the triclosan level (~0.15 to 0.65%), only one
sample containing parachlorometaxylenol was contaminat-
ed, and that was at a relatively low level (0.15%).
Table 1 shows a summary of these antimicrobial data.
Most of the samples tested contained no detected antimicro-
bial, and these samples contained the greatest fraction with
countable microorganisms, almost 17%. There was a
statistically significant difference between the fraction of
bacteria-positive samples with no detected antimicrobial agent
and those containing an antimicrobial agent (P ¼ 0.0035).
There was not a statistically significant difference between the
fractions of bacteria-positive samples for the two types of

 antimicrobial agents (P ¼ 0.1022). The fraction contaminated
in total for all soap samples collected was 12.5%.
The relationship between the type of location sampled
and the fraction of the time that samples contained
detectable microorganisms is shown in Table 2. Grocery
stores and fast food operations each had more than 10%
bulk-soap samples positive. Grocery stores, fast food
restaurants, and sit-down restaurants did not have signifi-
cantly different fractions of contaminated samples from one
another (P . 0.05), but grocery stores and fast food
restaurants had significantly more (P , 0.05) contaminated
bulk-soap samples than convenience stores.
The breakdown of bulk-soap samples in Table 3 shows
that both men’s and women’s bathrooms have contaminated
soap .10% of the time. Although samples collected from
men’s restrooms have a slightly higher frequency of
detectable bacteria, the difference was not significant (P ¼
0.29).
The relationship between soap color and the presence of
detectable bacteria is shown in Table 4. There are
differences in the fraction of samples containing detectable
bacteria, by soap color. However, given the wide array of
soap colors observed, and the small number of samples
containing detectable microorganisms, no differences were
statistically significant.
Table 5 shows the fraction of samples containing
detectable microorganisms by state, with .10% of soap
contaminated in all three states. There were not statistically
significant differences among the three states where soap
samples were collected (P . 0.05).
DISCUSSION
This study identified gram-negative organisms as the
primary organisms that colonize bulk-soap dispensers,

 consistent with past outbreaks (1, 2, 24, 38) and screening
studies (8, 25). We identified gram-negative organisms at a
broad range of populations (1 to 7 log CFU/mL), as reported
by Momeni et al. (2 to 9 log CFU/mL (25)). Whereas
Momeni et al. found detectable bacteria in ~60% of their
samples, we found detectable bacteria in 15% of samples.
This may be owing to differences in sample size (our 296
versus their 14), locations (three states versus two institutes),
and type of facility (food service versus dental institute).
Chattman et al. (8) collected 541 bulk-soap samples from
five U.S. cities (Boston, Atlanta, Columbus, Los Angeles,
Dallas), from liquid soap dispensers in a wide variety of
public settings: offices, health clubs, restaurants, and retail
stores. These authors found heterotrophic and coliform
populations greater than ~2 log CFU/mL in ~19% of the
sink area dispensers, similar to what we found (.2 log CFU/
mL in ~15% of dispensers).
Specifically relevant to the food industry was the
identification of S. sonnei from a contaminated soap
dispenser in Arizona. According to the CDC, S. sonnei is
the predominant cause of shigellosis in industrialized
countries (and is the most common species in the United
States). Consumption of ready-to-eat food contaminated due
to handling by an infected worker could be a significant
contributor to the spread of S. sonnei (4).
The published literature reports that bacteria are more
commonly isolated from plain soaps (1, 5, 27, 30) and are
less frequently isolated from antimicrobial soaps (1, 2, 24),
which is consistent with the findings from our study.
Although fewer bacteria are generally isolated from
antimicrobial soaps (as they were in our study), it is a
major technical challenge to maintain the activity of active
ingredients, such as triclosan, so that they are not bound by
the surfactant micelles (11, 34). Our research clearly shows
that the presence of an antimicrobial agent is not a safeguard
against the colonization of bulk soap by bacteria. This is
consistent with Archibald et al. (1), who detected S.
marcescens in 1% chloroxylenol soap (parachlorometaxyle-
nol), and with Barry et al. (2) and McNaughton et al. (24),
who isolated bacteria from soap that contained triclosan.
It is well understood by chemists that formulation
affects the performance of hand hygiene products (10, 23).
Our study is a reminder that quality also matters in soap
development. For example, high water–low solids formula-
tions may be less expensive to manufacture, but they are
more likely to be contaminated. Soap delivery systems
designed to allow mixing (or dilution of soaps to save
money) promote colonization and lead to less-stable
formulations. We also observed differences among types
of food establishments. Fast food and grocery stores are
more likely to be contaminated than convenience stores; this
may be because, in the former, there is less maintenance and
management oversight of the bathrooms, whereas conve-
nience stores typically have small bathrooms that are
cleaned frequently. Fast food restaurants should be of the
greatest concern because food handlers often use the
bathrooms we sampled that were located in the ‘‘front of
the house’’ and then often return directly from the bathroom
into the kitchen. This finding warrants strong consideration
of Food Code restrictions on the use of bulk soap in
restaurants, analogous to rules that discourage their use in
health care (3, 31, 39).
We believe this work is generalizable across the United
States. Samples were obtained from a variety of food
handling environments in three states spread across the
country, with a wide range of weather (temperature and
humidity); we found no significant differences in level of
microbial contamination among states. Our findings show
that the design of open refillable systems for dispensing bulk
soap is fundamentally flawed and creates opportunities for
contamination and biofilm development, independent of
geographic location. Future needs and opportunities include
better understanding the relationship of bathroom design
(e.g., toilet proximity to the soap dispenser, size of
bathroom) and further assessment of the risk of antibiotic-
resistant bacteria in bulk soaps. Alternative approaches to
achieve a lower or acceptable cost to the food service
provider are also important, because low cost is the primary
attraction to bulk-soap systems. Changing this practice will
require good policy development, analogous to what
happened in health care (3).
Use of refillable bulk-soap dispensers is a clear public
health concern because they provide an environment for
bacteria to grow, often to high populations (8, 21, 25, 30,
40), and their use has led to non–foodborne disease
outbreaks (1, 2, 5, 24, 27, 30, 38). In our study, most soap

samples that did have detectable bacteria (12.5%) had
populations that would be considered highly risky if the
bacteria present were pathogenic (~7 log CFU/mL).
Whereas the CDC recommends that bulk liquid soap
dispensers be thoroughly cleaned before adding fresh soap
(3, 8, 14), cleanings in between soap refills might not
prevent recontamination (21), and difficult-to-clean biofilms
may develop. Bulk soap has been proven to cause infection
outbreaks in health care settings. It has been difficult to
document outbreaks in food service settings to date;
however, our findings show that the use of bulk soap
presents a clear risk in food service facilities.
