Abstract
Purpose. Primarily to evaluate the radiation dose delivered to patients with
obesity in projection radiography and its relationship to the patient’s size. A
secondary purpose is to estimate the subsequent projected radiation-related
lifetime cancer risk to patients with obesity compared to normal-weight
patients. Method and material. Data from 1964 patients from a bariatric clinic
in the UK were reviewed with the relevant permission. 630 patients were
identified to have a projection radiography history and were included in the
study. Patients’ dose area product (DAP) data were collected for all projection
radiography. Multiple exams in one day including a single DAP reading and

 exams with no records of DAP and exposure factors were excluded. Corre-
lations were calculated and data analysed to yield the third quartile for each
examination using STATA 14. Absorbed doses were generated from PCXMC
simulation, utilising DAP data from this study and the UK national diagnostic
reference level (NDRL), to calculate the effective risk for patients with obesity
compared to patients with normal-weight. Results. Patients with obesity
received higher DAPs for all examinations included in this study compared to
NDRL. Abdominal and lumbar spine radiographs DAPs were the highest
(17.6 and 30.31 Gy cm2) compared to the NDRL (2.5 and 4 Gy cm2). Only
moderate to low correlations were found between patient’s size and DAPs in
the abdomen and chest radiographs. The projected radiation-related lifetime
cancer risk for patients with obesity is up to 153% higher than for adult
patients with normal weight. Conclusion. Patients with obesity receive higher
DAPs than normal-weight adults which may be in excess of that expected due
to their size. Therefore, radiation-related lifetime cancer risk is increased in
patients with obesity as a result of medical radiation exposures. This indicates
more dose optimisation research is needed in this group of patients to reduce
dose rate and variation.

Introduction
Medical imaging is by far the largest man-made source of ionising radiation delivered to the
general population [1]. It accounts for 15% of the radiation dose from both natural and
artificial sources and 90% of the artificial source alone [2]. In England, approximately
40.7 million radiographic procedures were carried out in the year between March 2015 and
March 2016, of a projected population of 54.4 million [3, 4]. More than half (22.6 million) of
these were projection radiography examinations. The x-rays used in medical imaging are a
form of ionising radiation, that have sufficient energy when interacting with human tissues to
result in ionisation and or excitation [5, 6]. This has the potential to cause damage to the
exposed tissue and result in cell mutation or apoptosis. The higher the radiation dose, the
more likely that tissue damage will occur. This is known as a stochastic effect which occurs in
low dose procedures, such as projection radiography where there is no safe limit of radiation
dose based on the ‘linear no-threshold’ model. This model is considered by many regulatory
and advisory groups as a scientifically valid approach [7, 8], hence it underpins radiation
protection in medical imaging where the dose should be kept as low as reasonably practicable
(ALARP) [9]. In order to comply with this principle, the International Commission of
Radiological Protection (ICRP) introduced the term ‘diagnostic reference level’ (DRL) in
1996, which is a quality assurance (QA) tool to investigate the radiation dose delivered to
different patients for the same procedure [10]. This was adapted by the ICRP after the concept
‘reference dose’ for common projection radiographic procedures was introduced in the UK in
1990 [11]. In the UK, under the Ionising Radiation(Medical Exposure)Regulation 2000
(IRMER, 2000), the hospital employer is required by law to set a DRL and ensure it is
followed and adhered to [9]. The most recent review of the national DRL in the UK was
conducted in 2010 to maintain and monitor radiation doses to the UK population, and it was
based on mean patient’s weight per x-ray room, which ranges between 65 and 75 kg [2]. This
weight range represents the standard size-patient, but not patients with obesity [2].

 However, in the last few decades, the prevalence of obesity has risen with the developed
countries leading and developing countries following [12]. Internationally, 1.46 billion adults
are overweight, of them 502 million are obese [13]. In the UK, around a quarter of the adult
population are obese, with the prevalence in females higher than in males except in Northern
Ireland where males tend to be heavier [14]. Due to the limitations incurred by physical size
and body composition variation compared to adult patients with normal weight, obesity poses
a challenge in patient’s assessment and management in hospital [15]. The ability to achieve an
adequate clinical examination is compromised in this population [16]. Likewise, it becomes
difficult to listen to heart sounds, lung respiration and bowel sounds [16]. Additionally, the
capability to palpate the abdomen, perform a clinical pelvic examination and evaluate for
masses is compromised in clinical practice [16]. These in turn have increased reliance on
other health care assessments, including medical imaging, for this substantial group of people
[16]. Due to the recognised obesity comorbidities [17–20], patients with obesity are more
likely to present for health assessment than their normal-weight peers.
As a result, literature has emerged recently reporting the challenges facing radiology
departments managing patients with obesity. In the context of radiation protection, patients
with obesity are receiving higher doses as a result of computed tomography (CT) and
interventional procedures [21–24]. However, in projection radiography, the dose to patients
with obesity in clinical practice has yet to be reported. With the high prevalence of obesity
and the amount of radiographic exposures conducted annually as discussed earlier, it is of
high importance to explore the actual radiation dose delivered to obese patient during pro-
jection radiography. Likewise, the literature is lacking radiation dose data for the other group
of patients, who are excessively underweight and could be at a higher risk; however, this
study focused on patients with obesity where the literature has already reported high doses
delivered in other modalities [21–24].
This study aimed to explore the ionising radiation dose area product (DAP) received by
patients with obesity during projection radiography; to identify any link between the DAP
received and patient’s anthropometrics and to estimate the subsequent projected radiation-
related lifetime cancer risk based on the reported DAPs for patients with obesity compared to
national dose data for patients with normal weight. Due to the nature of the study, retro-
spective, image quality was not investigated. However, a previous study [25] has reported an
increase in the number of habitus-limited radiology reports between 1989 and 2003 in
the USA.
Materials and methods
Ethical approval
Ethical approval was not required according to the research and development department in
the hospital. Permission was granted to conduct the study as a service evaluation.
Patients
A list of 1964 patients with obesity, based on the World Health Organisation [26] criteria, of a
body mass index (BMI) equal to, or over, 30 kg m−2, was provided from a bariatric surgeon in
the hospital, which is considered as the largest bariatric centre in the region. All patients had
visited the bariatric surgery clinic and undergone a bariatric surgery procedure. The list
contained the patients’ hospital number, height (m), weight (kg) and BMI (kg m−2). All
anthropometric measures were completed prior to the patient undergoing bariatric surgery.

 The age of the patients at the time of their radiography examination was determined from
their date of birth subtracted from the date of the radiography exam.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
All data provided by the bariatric surgeon were for patients with obesity, and hence, they were
eligible for the study. Files were screened and any projection radiography procedure was
included unless: the DAP or its unit was missing; the procedure did not match the NDRL
criteria in terms of the number and types of projections; if the DAP reading was recorded once
for multiple radiographic exams and if the exposure factors were not recorded.
As the study aimed to compare the DAP to the NDRL, only the radiographic exam-
inations for which the NDRL had been calculated were considered. In the abdomen, only
patients with an anteroposterior (AP) were included. As noted in the picture archiving and
communication system (PACS), radiographers usually perform abdominal radiographs using
two images, and occasionally three images, but enter one DAP reading in the radiology
information system (RIS). This is justifiable by the fact that the largest image receptor, which
is 35 cm×43 cm, cannot accommodate the whole abdomen. For this reason, whether the
patient had two or three images to cover the abdominal area, it was considered as an AP
projection, and hence analysed and compared to the NDRL. In the chest, the analysis was
restricted to the posteroanterior (PA) projection. In the pelvis, patients with AP projection
only were included. In the lumbar and cervical spine, if the patients had AP and lateral (LAT)
projections only, then they were eligible for the study. This is attributed to the availability of
DAP for AP and lateral in the NDRL, which was combined for each procedure and then
compared to the DAP result from this data. Other procedures were considered but not
included in the study as they had no DAP comparator in the NDRL, For example; knee,
shoulder, foot and all other extremity procedures. Thoracic spine was also excluded since the
collected data were fewer than 10 patients and most of them had one DAP for multiple
projections. As the study was conducted retrospectively in a clinical environment, the DAP
dosimeters were assumed to be maintained and had a QA regime following current legislation
and hospital standard operating procedures.
Obtaining the data
Patients’ hospital numbers were entered into the RIS (Carestream Vue RIS, Version
11.0.12.51) to open the radiology file and the DAP reading was accessible through exam
details. The unit of the DAP reading, for each exam and patient, was recorded along with the
DAP value.
In order to reduce the human errors during the data recording, several rules were fol-
lowed during the data transition. To confirm the file belonged to the right patient, two checks
were used: the hospital number and the patient age. The DAP unit for each entry was recorded
as it appears in the RIS, and then converted to Gray cm2 prior to the analysis. To check the
procedure matches the DRL criteria in terms of number and type of projections, PACS (VUE
PACS version 12.0.0.8902) was used to access the images and confirm the eligibility of each
procedure. The data were recorded separately in excel sheets for each examination.
Data analysis
The mean, median, standard deviation, minimum and maximum were calculated for age,
height, weight, BMI and DAP. Any outlying values were investigated and errors were cor-
rected after re-checking patient details again before the final analysis. The statistical analysis
J. Radiol. Prot. 39 (2019) 38
S J M Alqahtani et al
41
 was performed using STATA 14. Histograms of the anthropometric measures demonstrated
the data were not normally distributed. For this reason, Spearman’s correlation was conducted
to investigate the relation between the DAP in each procedure and the participants’ age,
height, weight and BMI.
Dose modelling
A PC programme for x-ray Monte Carlo (PCXMC 2.0—STUK-Radiation and Nuclear Safety
Authority, Helsinki, Finland) was used to model the mean organ absorbed doses. PCXMC is a
computer programme for calculating patients’ organ absorbed doses and effective dose from
radiology examinations. It has a flexible stylized phantom to freely adjust for the x-ray
projection and other examination conditions of projection radiography and fluoroscopy. The
anatomical data of the phantom are based on the mathematical hermaphrodite phantom
models of Cristy and Eckerman, with some modifications and user-adjustable phantom sizes
[27, 28]. The PCXMC is widely used in the literature for absorbed dose estimation in normal-
weight adult and paediatric [29, 30]. In high BMI groups of patients, PCXMC has already
been validated against voxel phantom [31], which showed a similar trend to hybrid phantom
in absorbed dose inverse relationship with BMI.
The organ absorbed doses were estimated for the five radiography procedures reported in
this study compared with the 2010 NDRL review [2]. The phantom size and exposure
parameters for both groups were adjusted based on the reported value of each parameter. For
the normal-weight group, the size was adjusted in terms of weight (kg) according to the mean
weight in 2010 NDRL review. The height was set to the standard height in the PCXMC,
178.6 (cm) for the same group. With regards to patient with obesity, the height (cm) and
weight (kg) were set to the median value in each radiograph as they were not normally
distributed. The x-ray beam projection, size and collimation were adjusted as appropriate for
the examination. Likewise, the x-ray spectrum was adjusted through appropriate selection of
the x-ray tube voltage, as reported for the two groups, filtration and anode angle (table 1).
Focal to image distance (FID) was set to the standard figure for each procedure as
described by Bontrager and Lampignano [32], but this may not reflect what was used
clinically in the hospital as such measurement is not recordable in either RIS or PACS. The
FSD is then calculated by subtracting the phantom thickness from the FID.
The median DAP (mGy cm2) reported in the NDRL 2010 review and in this study was
used in the calculation by PCXMC [2]. However, the standard practice at the sites involved in
this study was to input a single DAP reading for the imaging series. The DAP for lumbar
spine was extracted from the RIS as one number for both views, AP and LAT, and similarly
for cervical spine. For this reason, the combined DAP of lumbar spine AP and LAT, from the
2010 review, was used as a benchmark to determine the percentage of DAP for each view
separately [2]. As a result, the AP represents 37.5% of the combined median DAP for AP and
LAT while the LAT view represents 62.5%. Likewise for cervical spine examinations, the AP
view represents 50% and the LAT view represents 50% of combined median DAP value.
While this provides some limitations to this study, it does still provide an indication of the risk
an obese patient is subjected to and is comparable with the NDRLs. The use of DAPs reported
in the NDRL rather than the local DRL is due to the fact that NDRL values are derived from
large data across the country which reflects common practice. Additionally, the combined
average local DRL for the five reported procedures is 32% below the combined NDRL for the
same procedures. In order to reduce the errors in organ absorbed dose estimation, the number
of photons was set to one million.

 Radiation-related lifetime cancer risk estimation
The radiation-related lifetime cancer risk was calculated as described by Brenner [33], where
he proposed the use of effective risk instead of effective dose to calculate the risk of cancer as
a result of ionising radiation exposure. The equation of effective risk calculation is similar to
that of effective dose. The difference is that the tissue weighting factor in the effective dose
equation was replaced with organ-specific radiation-induced cancer risk, such as those pub-
lished by The Nuclear and Radiation studies board (BEIR VII) and the report by the Health
Protection Agency [34, 35]. However, the argument about effective risk and effective dose
utilisation in cancer risk estimation is beyond the scope of this paper and already reported in
the literature [33, 34, 36].
In this study, the age and sex specific radiation-related lifetime cancer risk figures
reported by Wall et al [34], was used in effective risk calculation. The sum of the product of
the estimated organ dose (mGy) and the radiation-related lifetime cancer risk incidence for
that organ (percentage per mGy) gave the effective risk. The effective risk for each exam-
ination was calculated as described in Wall et al [34, 35]. The age was set from 20 years and
above, as our data shows very few patients under 20.
Results
Of 1964 patients with obesity, 1225 files were excluded for technical issues such as; repeated
file number, no radiology file existed, different file ID format and files with multiple patients’
names. The remaining 739 files were screened and 630 of them showed history of projection
radiography while 109 showed no history. Table 2 summarises the characteristics of patients’
anthropometry for each procedure.
This includes patients who met the criteria of the NDRL for each procedure in terms of
types of view. Among the patients with obesity in our sample are young patients, less than
20 years age. Also, radiographers are managing patients with a BMI of 98.2 kg m−2, as this
cohort shows.
Table 3 summarises the radiation dose (DAP) received by patients with obesity for each
procedure. The 75th percentile DAP for lumbar spine (AP+LAT) and abdomen (AP) are the
highest while the chest (PA) is the lowest, as table 3 shows.
For comparison purposes, the 75th percentile of the DAP was reported and compared to
the NDRL in table 3. The NDRL was based on a mean patient weight of 65–75 kg. As shown
in table 3, patients with obesity were exposed to a significantly higher DAP especially in
lumbar, abdomen and pelvis radiograph. The difference percentage between 75th percentile
of the DAP for abdomen AP is 604% higher in patients with obesity compared to patients
with normal-weight. In lumbar spine, the difference reached up to 657% higher in patients
with obesity.
Since the patient’s doses are dependent on the patient size [37], the relationship between
the DAP and the patients’ anthropometrics was tested. As shown in table (4), weak to
moderate correlations were found between DAP in chest and abdomen with patient’s size.

No correlations were found between patient anthropometrics and DAP in the remaining
procedures.

 Table 5 outlines the radiation-related lifetime cancer risk as a function of age at exposure
and sex. As seen, the radiation-related lifetime cancer risk in lumbar spine and abdominal
x-ray are the highest per million exposures. The increase in radiation-related lifetime cancer
risk in patients with obesity can reach up to 152% increase especially in younger patients
compared to patients with normal-weight.
Discussion
The study aimed to evaluate the radiation DAP delivered to patients with obesity in projection
radiography and explored the relationship between DAP and patient anthropometrics. The
projected radiation-related lifetime cancer risk in patients with obesity was estimated and
compared to adult patients with normal-weight, based on the latest NDRL review 2010 [2].
For the five procedures reported in this study; abdomen (AP), lumbar spine (AP+LAT),
chest (PA), pelvis (AP) and cervical spine (AP+LAT), patients with obesity received higher
DAPs, compared to the NDRL values for these procedures. The highest DAP was reported in
abdominal (AP) and lumbar spine (AP+LAT) radiographs (17.6 and 30.31 Gy cm2)
respectively. This is of concern as these two examinations comprise 3.81% and 2.53% of the
x-ray examinations conducted in the UK out of 231 types of examinations [38]. Whole dose
are lower when compared with CT, which contributes to 47% of the medical radiation dose
within the UK population, while projection radiography still contributes 34% [39]. However,
when considering the high prevalence of obesity in the UK, the large number of patients with
obesity presenting for radiographic assessments due to obesity related comorbidities along
with difficult clinical assessment and the high percentage of these two procedures, the col-
lective and cumulative dose will be of concern. Moreover, the most sensitive organs such as
colon and stomach are in the direct beam of radiation in these two procedures, while the
remaining sensitive tissue such as lungs and breast are in the near field of scattered radiation.
The DAPs of pelvis (AP) is not as high as in the case of abdomen and lumbar spine
radiographs. This is counterintuitive, however, this could be attributed to the small number of
27 patients included in this study. Radiographers are facing tremendous challenges when
imaging patients with obesity as the data indicates the weight of patients with obesity can
reach up to 300 kg. The weak to fairly moderate correlations between the DAP and patient’s
size in abdomen and chest procedures indicate that high DAPs are delivered to lower BMI
patients within the cohort and vice versa. This could be attributed to the absence of clear
guidelines in the literature to help achieve an optimal image with the lowest practicable dose
[40]. Such variation has already been reported in selection of exposure factors, which impact
directly on DAP, for patients with obesity [41]. However, the local DRL for the reported
investigations in this study is lower by 32% on average than NDRL. This indicates good
protocols already in place to ensure adherence with the ALARP principle. As a result, the
reported DAPs for patients with obesity could be at the lower band of radiation dose (DAP) to
this group of patients as the local DRL evident the good practice in place. Additionally, as a
bariatric centre, the staff are highly trained to x-ray patients with obesity. The increase in the
radiation-related lifetime cancer risk incidence is an indication of new challenges in the health
management of patients with obesity. Due to the semi-identical median DAP for both groups
in cervical spine AP & LAT projections, the absorbed dose in the obese group was less than
NDRL group. This eventually impacts on the cancer risk estimation which shows a decrease
in radiation-related lifetime cancer risk in obese group compared to the DRL group. This
could be explained by the fact that the absorbed dose in patients with obesity less than the
normal-weight adult when receiving identical DAPs, due to the extra fat which acts as a

 protection layer for the internal organs. The reported radiation-related lifetime cancer risk in
this study is a projected risk and did not take into account any other factors or background
cancer rates. Additionally, it does not consider the issue of obese patients may receive more
diagnostic radiography procedures but rather consider the single exposure reported in this
study. This is due to the uncertainty in the model used to calculate the risk. Although, obesity
is already reported to increase the risk of different types of rare cancers [20], however, the
projected radiation-related lifetime cancer risk reported in this study is applied only on this
cohort group based on the reported DAP of the specific radiographic investigations. Hence,
the radiation-related lifetime cancer risk to the whole obese populations has not been con-
sidered as the data were collected from one centre. Likewise, the same applies to the normal-
weight group, as the projected radiation-related lifetime cancer risk is for the patients who
received identical DAP dose reported in the NDRL, which does not necessarily applies to all
patients with normal weight due to the variation of local DRLs across the country.
This study is the first study to report the radiation dose (DAP) delivered to patients with
obesity in projection radiography and to calculate effective risk for this group of patients.
Yanch and colleagues have reported similar results of high effective dose delivered to patients
with obesity but these were based on Monte Carlo simulation [42]. They utilised layers of fat
added to the computer based stylised phantom in five different orientations, which do not
necessarily reflect actual patients shape. Also they did not base the simulation on radiation
dose data, either entrance surface dose or DAP, reported in clinical practice, which does not
reflect radiographers’ practice in clinical context.
Despite that, the current study should be interpreted in the context of its limitations. As a
retrospective study, restrictions were unavoidably placed on the exclusion criteria. For
example, DAP readings are usually entered by the radiographer for multiple views or even
multiple examinations, if conducted at the same time. As a result, inclusion of such patients
was not possible as the DAP is not representative of the view and exam of interest. This
means the DAPs could be higher than the values reported in the study. The opposite could
also be true as the DAP readings jeopardise of typos entry mistakes by the radiographers at
the time of the exam. As the study was conducted retrospectively, one of its limitations is the
lack of the examined anatomy thickness data, which of course could vary for the same BMI
group patients.
Another limitation of the study is the use of PCXMC 2.0 to estimate mean organ
absorbed dose. This is attributed to the fact that the PCXMC phantom does not take into
account the changed morphology and fat distribution in organs of patients with obesity, this
impacts on the accuracy of the estimated absorbed dose. However, to date there is no
accessible computerised voxel phantom, representative of high BMI similar to the mean BMI
of the participants in the current study, in order to use other Monte Carlo as an alternative for
more realistic absorbed dose estimation. Additionally, the accuracy of the estimated radiation-
related lifetime cancer risk limited by the uncertainties of the BEIR II model, used in this
study, which is based on the life-span studies of atomic bomb survivors and the risk coef-
ficient, which is statistical averages over many individuals of the same gender and similar age.
Hence, caution must be taken when interpreting the results individual radiation-related life-
time cancer risk. Nevertheless, the results provide a valid starting point for future research on
this topic.
The study shows a new potential challenge in patients with obesity’ management in
radiology departments specifically, with serious implications for the health service in general.
DAP variations demonstrate the need for clear and accessible guidelines of obese patient’s
management in radiology departments. Additionally, the study highlights the increases
likelihood of cancers to be seen among patients with obesity who undergo such

 investigations. Therefore, extra work on dose optimisation is required and guidelines need to
be in place to assist the radiographers in imaging these patients. Clinician could use the results
of the current study when communicating the benefit and risk of such investigation.
Several aspects of the study results warrant further studies. Our study considered patients
with obesity, but the BMI range was 40 kg m−2 and over. This is mainly because the data
were sourced from a bariatric surgery where patients’ BMI tends to be 40 kg m−2 and above,
in accordance with the national institute for health and care excellence [43]. Hence, the
patients with obesity ranged from 30 to 40 kg m−2, which possibly account for a relatively
large group of people, were not reported. This was not possible as such data are not usually
collected for the projection radiography procedures in the site where this study is conducted.
A future prospective study where patient’s height and weight are measured before the exam
could be conducted to evaluate the DAP for the group of patients with BMI between 30 and
40 kg m−2. Additionally, further studies could be conducted to determine the factors that
impact on DAP such as radiographer’s experiences and type of x-ray machine.
Conclusions
The findings of the current study may have implications for clinicians, radiographers, policy
makers and health economists. Clinicians should re-consider the radiation-related cancer risk
when justifying x-ray procedure for patients with obesity, which is different to patient with
normal-weight. Radiographers could specifically evaluate the DAP to patients with obesity
periodically. Additionally, daily monitoring of imaging this group of patients and recording the
level of obesity and the exposure factors used could help in tackling this issue through the
auditing. Policy makers considering improving the quality of health services could take this result
into account and negotiate with health technology manufacturers to find ways to tackle the high
dose delivered to patients with obesity. For health economists, this could be taken into account
when estimating the economic burden as a result of obesity. Additionally, research is needed in
dose optimisation for patients with obesity to establish appropriate exposure guidelines.
