Abstract:
Background: Sex workers are disproportionately affected by HIV and other STIs com-
pared with the general population. To date, most studies of HIV risk among sex workers
focus on individual-level risk factors, with few studies evaluating potential structural de-
terminants of HIV risk. In this paper we examine whether criminal laws around sex work
are associated with HIV prevalence among sex workers.
Method: To test our hypothesis, we estimate cross-sectional, ecological regression models
using data from 27 European countries on HIV prevalence among sex workers from the
European Centre for Disease Control; sex-work legislation on U.S. State Department’s
Country Reports on Human Rights Practices; the Rule of Law and GDP per capita, ad-
justed for purchasing power, from the World Bank; and the prevalence of injection drug
use among sex workers.
Findings: We found that countries which have legalised some aspects of sex work (n = 10)
have significantly lower HIV prevalence among sex workers than those which have not (n
= 17) (β = -2.09, 95% CI: -0.80 to -3.37, p = 0.003), even after controlling for the level of
economic development and the proportion of sex workers who are injecting drug users.

 We observe that the relationship between sex work policy and HIV among sex workers
may be partially moderated by the effectiveness and fairness of enforcement, suggesting
legalization of some aspects of sex work may reduce HIV among sex workers to the great-
est extent in countries where the enforcement is fair and effective.
Interpretation: Our findings suggest that legalizing some aspects of sex work may help re-
duce HIV prevalence in this high-risk group, particularly in countries where the judiciary
is effective and fair.

Evidence before this study We searched PubMed on 8 September 2016 using the terms “HIV”,
“sex worker*”, “Europe”, “structural” and we found 17 previous studies. Of which, six were
studies of specific countries (such as Germany, Armenia, or Russia), which alone are un-
able to illuminate cross-national patterns in HIV across sex workers. Five were review
essays and programmes of action which called for such changes to occur. Two were qual-
itative studies which did not attempt to explore cross-national differences in sex work
policy and HIV. Two were systematic reviews and meta-analyses. One, which estimated
the prevalence of HIV among sex workers worldwide, was not explicitly concerned with
legal context. The other conducted simulation modelling of changes to legal context. The
simulation modelling exercises offer an approximation of how sex work policy affects HIV
but are necessarily reliant on parameter estimates from earlier studies of the effect of legal
context for specific locations, which, to date, are inferred from related outcomes, such as
police harassment. Two conducted cross-national analysis of structural risk factors but
neither specifically examined legal structures. This is consistent with the recent review by
Shannon et al. which draws attention to important gaps in this literature. To date, studies
in this area have been based on country-specific analyses of simulation modelling. These
have provided important evidence but there is a need for more detailed analyses examin-
ing structural risk factors for HIV among sex workers. Specifically, previous ecological
analyses do not examine the association between legal structures and HIV risk among sex
workers.
Added value of this study This is the first study – despite its limitations – to conduct an eco-
logical analysis of the association between HIV risk among sex workers and legal struc-
tures that may influence this risk. We offer cross-national evidence of an association be-
tween sex work policy and HIV prevalence among sex workers, results that will support
future simulation modelling of changes to sex work policy. We also show that association
between sex work policy and HIV among sex workers is moderated by an effective and
fair legal system.
Implications of all the available evidence Our findings suggest that legalising sex work may
help reduce HIV prevalence in this high-risk group.

Sex workers – those who exchange sex for money – are disproportionately affected by HIV
compared with the general population.(1-4) Elevated risk occurs because sex workers have
multiple sexual partners who may request condomless sex.(5) Sex work can be accompanied
by other high risk behaviours, including injecting drug use(6) and substance use.(7) Sex work-
ers are also often exposed to physical and sexual violence, commonly have limited access to
(and utilization of) healthcare services,(7, 8) and may face exclusion / social stigma.(9) Whilst
HIV prevalence among sex workers appears to be substantially higher than the wider popula-
tion in some contexts, prevalence rates vary markedly across countries in Europe.(2, 3, 10) For
example, HIV prevalence among sex workers seems to be quite low in Czech Republic (0.1%),
but high in Latvia (22%), suggesting that structural factors may shape HIV prevalence among
those who exchange sex for money.(2)
To date, the impact of structural determinants of HIV risk on sex workers remains uncertain, in
part because most existing studies do not explicitly consider structural drivers, instead focus-
ing on individual-level predictors of HIV risk, such as knowledge about HIV transmission.(3,
5) A 2015 review of the global epidemiology of HIV in female sex workers concluded, “an un-
derstanding of how structural factors (e.g., contextual factors external to the individual) shape
HIV acquisition and transition risks has only just begun to emerge”.(5)
One commonly invoked structural risk factor is sex work policy, particularly the existence
of laws that criminalise buying, selling, and/or procuring sex (see Figure 1).(11, 12) Such laws
mayexacerbate stigmaandexclusionfacedbysexworkers, abrogatingaccesstoessentialhealth
services and increasing risks of exploitation and violence.(8, 13) These provisions can result in
more precarious working environments and greater poverty, all of which increase HIV risks.(5,
14) Such insecurity may make it more difficult for sex workers to negotiate condom usage, as
they may: i) feel compelled to engage in condomless sex (as condoms can be used as evidence
in judicial proceedings) or ii) work in hidden areas away from possible police detection and/or
police harassment.(12, 15, 16) Moreover, criminalization of sex work may force sex workers
to work in isolation, deprived of any protection police may offer. Thus, criminalization may
infringeonthe rights of sexworkers, increasemarginalization, reducingaccessto HIVservices,
and ultimately increasing their risk for HIV infection. For example, recent modelling estimates
project that decriminalising sex work in Canada could avert 39% of infections among female
sex workers over a 10-year period.(5)
Legal structures may only affect health outcomes if they are effectively and fairly implemented,
suggestingenforcementmaymoderatetherelationshipbetweensexworkpolicyandHIVpreva-
lence.(17) Thus, in figure 1, the rule of law influences whether legal context affects police prac-
tices or access to services which, in turn, may affect condom use and HIV prevalence. Impor-
tantly, the rule of law may affect sex workers differently depending on sex work policy. Among
countries that criminalise sex work, we would not anticipate a clear association between the
rule of law and HIV among sex workers, because police activity can increase stigmatization and
isolation. Whereas, among countries that legalise or decriminalise sex work, we would antic-
ipate a negative association between the rule of law and HIV prevalence among sex workers,

In this study, to our knowledge for the first time, we take advantage of the diversity of le-
gal frameworks across European countries to test the hypothesis that legalising some aspects
of sex work is associated with lower HIV prevalence among sex workers when compared to
countries that retain criminal laws. We also explore whether better enforcement mediates the
relationship between sex work policy and HIV prevalence among sex workers.

Sex work can involve many forms of erotic labour but in this paper we focus on sex workers
who exchange sex for money.(18) We collected data on the proportion of sex workers living
with HIV from the ECDC’s latest estimates for 27 European countries.(2) These data are pro-
vided through the Dublin Declaration as part of the Global Aids Response Progress Reporting
(GARPR) indicators, one of which is HIV prevalence. Survey strategies differ across countries,
in terms of methods and sample size (Web Appendix 1).
The laws governing sex work vary considerably across European countries (see Table 1).(19)
We collected data on the laws governing sex work in Europe from country reports on human
rights from the U.S. State Department and country-specific legal documents, a widely used
source for laws related to sex work.(17) Where necessary, we have supplemented these data
with other sources, such as statute documents (Table 1).

 Some jurisdictions, such as Lithuania, criminalise selling, buying, and procuring sex. Other
countries have legalised selling sex while criminalizing purchasing sex. Sweden, Norway, and
Iceland are prominent European examples of this approach (commonly known as the Nordic
model), although France and Northern Ireland have recently implemented similar laws. Al-
though rooted in feminist legal scholarship,(20) this approach has been associated with similar
harms to the criminalization model, such as violence, police repression, and greater risk of
HIV.(21, 22) A third set of countries (e.g., the UK) have legalized buying and selling sex but
have criminalized procurement through brothels or pimping. A final group of countries le-
galised most forms of organised and unorganised sex work (e.g. street workers and brothels),
albeit regulating the industry. Following previous work in this area, sex work is labelled ‘illegal’
in countries criminalising all aspects of sex work while we categorise as ‘legal’ those countries
that have legalized some aspects of sex work.(23, 24) Among ‘legal’ countries, we also distin-
guish i) those legalizing procurement and ii) those implementing the Nordic model of sex work
policy.
S���������� ������
We use ecological linear regression models to test whether legalizing some aspects of sex work
is associated with a lower proportion of sex workers living with HIV compared to countries
that criminalize sex work. We first present unadjusted models of the association between sex
work policy and HIV prevalence, for example:
HIVi =β0 + β1Legali + ϵit
(1)
Here i is country. HIV is the logged prevalence of HIV among sex workers drawn from the
latest available data. The data are logged to adjust for positive skew in the distribution of HIV
prevalence. Legal is a binary exposure variable, where countries that retain criminal laws are
coded as 0, and countries that have reformed some or all aspects of sex work are coded as 1.
The dichotomous measure of sex work policy is used in all regression models except where
otherwise stated.
Equation 1 – and all other regression models – are weighted according to the sample size of
the country-specific data. To reduce the possible influence of measurement error, this places
greater weight on HIV prevalence estimates coming from large samples, whilst recognising
that larger sample sizes are still potentially biased. Our assumption is that larger samples of this
hard-to-reach population are more representative of this population as a whole than smaller
samples.
Next, we estimate adjusted models, which include each of our additional controls sequentially
and independently, based on previous population risk factors identified in the literature (see
figure 1). These include gross domestic product per capita in 2005, adjusted for inflation and
purchasing power (World Bank) and the proportion of sex workers who are also injecting drug
users.(10, 25)
6
 We also explore the relationship between HIV prevalence among sex workers and other forms
of sex work policy. First, we compare countries legalizing buying and selling sex but not pro-
curement - coded as 1 - from countries legalizing buying, selling, and procurement - coded as
2. Second, we compare countries implementing the Nordic model to countries that i) permit
the market for sex but not procurement and ii) permit both the market for sex and procure-
ment through brothels. These tests explore in more detail some of the variation in sex work
policy across countries masked by our primary (dichotomous) indicator.
In a final stage we test whether enforcement of sex work policy moderates the relationship
between laws and HIV outcomes (see figure 1). To measure enforcement we use an indicator
ofthe‘RuleofLaw’takenfromtheWorldBank’sGovernanceIndicators,(25)whichismeasured
on a scale of -1.4 to 1.9 in our data (with higher scores representing a better rule of law) and
captures the confidence people have in effectiveness and fairness of judiciary, including the
police force. To test the moderating effect of the Rule of Law on HIV risk among countries
that criminalise or legalise some aspects of sex work we stratify the analysis by sex work policy
and examine whether the Rule of Law is associated with reduced HIV prevalence in both sets
of countries. Descriptive statistics are listed in table 2 (Raw data are listed in Web Appendix 2).
All models were estimated using STATA v13.0.(26)

First, we compare the mean HIV prevalence rates among sex workers in countries where sex
work is criminalised and in countries where some aspects of it are legalised (see Figure 1; Web
Appendix 3). In countries where sex work is partly legalized the HIV prevalence is lower than
countries where sex work is criminalised (Table 3). For example, on average, 4.02% of sex
workers had HIV in countries where the practice was illegal (n = 10) while only 0.50% had HIV
in countries where some aspects of sex work have been legalized (n = 17).

prevalence data. Proportion of sex workers who are also injecting drug users comes from a recent paper by
Platt et al., 2013. GDP is adjusted for purchasing power parity.
After adjusting for the level of GDP, we find HIV prevalence among sex workers remains lower
in countries legalizing some aspects of sex work. We also include a measure of the prevalence
of injecting drug use among sex workers and again find consistent results (despite reducing the
sample size). Neither GDP nor the measure of the proportion of sex workers who are injecting
drug users are associated with HIV prevalence after controlling for sex work policy.
Next we compare the associations of different approaches to legalisation. Table 4 shows the
results of these models using a categorical (0 = criminalise, n = 10; 1 = legalise buying and/or
selling but not procurement, n = 16; 2 = legalise buying, selling, and procurement, n =1) rather
than dichotomous measure of sex work policy. We find that where selling sex is legal but broth-
els are not, HIV prevalence continues to be lower when compared with countries where sex
work is criminalised. This association is even stronger when looking at countries which le-
galise profiting from all forms of sex work (including brothels). However, there is only one
country in our analytic sample (Germany) that permits these forms of sex work and so these
results should be treated with some caution.

Ignoring countries that criminalise sex work, we then compare the Nordic model (Sweden and
Norway – coded as 0, n = 2) to countries legalising buying and selling but not procurement
(coded as 1, n = 14) and countries that legalise buying, selling, and procurement (coded as 2, n =
1). In an unadjusted model, we find no clear difference between the HIV prevalence among sex
workers in the Nordic countries and the countries legalizing buying and selling. However, and
whilst acknowledging the small number of observations involved, when we compare Sweden
and Norway with Germany (a country which also legalises procurement), we observe that HIV
prevalence is lower in Germany than the Nordic countries.
Enforcement of sex work policy may be an important moderator between laws and HIV out-
comes (Figure 1). There is no correlation between HIV prevalence among sex workers and the
Rule of Law (see Web Appendix 4) but, importantly, the Rule of Law may affect sex workers
differently depending on sex work policy. To test this hypothesis, we stratify the analysis by sex
work policy, finding that – as anticipated – the Rule of Law has a positive but uncertain rela-
tionship with HIV prevalence among sex workers in countries where sex work is criminalized
(see Table 5: Model 1). Yet, the Rule of Law is associated with lower HIV risk for sex workers in
countries that have legalized some aspects of sex work (see Table 5: Model 2). These findings
suggest that effective and fair enforcement mediates the relationship between legalisation and
HIV but only among countries that legalised some aspects of sex work.

To ensure our results are not explained by our modelling choices we conduct a series of sen-
sitivity tests: 1) removing outliers (Web Appendix 5), 2) including other possible confounders,
such as ART coverage and the population prevalence of HIV (Web Appendix 6), and 3) adjusting
for sample composition and data collection (Web Appendix 7). We also re-estimate the model
using a bootstrap procedure to test whether our results are explained by any single country
(Web Appendix 8). In each case, we find that our results do not qualitatively change.
D���������
Countries that have legalised some aspects of sex work have fewer sex workers living with
HIV.(5) In fact, countries that permit buying, selling, and procuring sex, appear to have the
lowest HIV prevalence among sex workers. This association is observed even when we ad-
just for the level of economic development and the proportion of sex workers estimated to be
injecting drug users.
These findings are consistent with other studies which observe that the removal of criminal
laws protects sex workers, allowing them to enter the formal economy, to benefit from social
insurance, and to receive protection from law enforcement.(3, 5) Removing criminal laws may
also allow sex workers to exit the industry more easily, allowing them to pursue other avenues
of employment. Such legal configurations also increase access to condoms, reduce the risk of
violence, and potentiallyempowerwomenin condomnegotiation.(7, 12, 13, 27-29)Ourresults
are also consistent with evidence that suggests the Nordic model may not reduce HIV risk
among sex workers and stresses lingering questions about the expansion of this legal approach
to sex work across the world.(21, 22)
Effective and fair enforcement of these laws appears to moderate the relationship between sex
work policy and HIV prevalence, suggesting HIV prevalence among sex workers is lowest in
countries that both legalise sex work and have an effective and fair judiciary. HIV risk for sex
10
 workers will be high in countries that criminalise sex work and have an ineffective and unfair
judiciary because they will be marginalised within society, potentially exposed to violence from
clients and police, and face the risk of prosecution.(9, 28) Yet, countries with an effective and
fair rule of law in contexts where sex work is criminalized may not necessarily improve HIV
risk. It may reduce police violence but may also increase marginalization by increasing fear of
arrest or prosecution.(12, 22) Among countries that legalise sex work the relationship will be
different. Legalising sex work – even in countries with an ineffective and/or unfair judiciary
– may still reduce HIV risk because legalisation will enable sex workers to access necessary
services, organise their work, and work in safer environments.(18) Further, countries with
an effective and fair rule of law in contexts where some aspects of sex work are legalized or
decriminalized may lead to even lower HIV risk because there will be more effective protection
against violence and better access to services.
However, the causal mechanisms linking legalization with HIV among sex workers remain
unclear because the timing and sequence of reforms to sex work policy may also shape how
legalization affects HIV prevalence.(30) Simply because a factor is causally associated with an
increase in HIV prevalence, it does not mean the removal of this factor would necessarily lead
to a reduction in HIV. For example, sex workers are less likely to forego condoms if they have
ever been the victim of violence, suggesting that reducing future risk of violence may only have
a limited effect on reducing HIV prevalence through increased condom usage.(5, 8) Moreover,
laws may change statutory rights but ‘stigma does not necessarily erode simply because sex
work is legal’.(22, 31, 32) More work is need to understand how legalization (and decriminal-
ization) may contribute toward reducing HIV prevalence among female sex workers.
There are a number of important limitations to this study. First, there is potential for ecolog-
ical fallacies, arising from the use of population-level data. Ideally we could use multi-level
data to compare situations across countries, including individual-level data, but these do not
currently exist. Second, and importantly, the HIV prevalence estimates are based on unrep-
resentative samples of hard to reach groups. This creates several methodological challenges.
One is the accuracy of estimates of HIV prevalence among sex workers, which may vary across
contexts because the willingness of sex workers to engage with researchers and clinics may be
lower in countries where sex work is criminalized. Further data collection procedures differ
between countries, meaning that cross-national comparisons may lack reliability. Thus, al-
though we use the best data available to test our research question, these differences between
countries are not trivial and lead to significant measurement error, which can lead to con-
servatively biased estimates of associations, as well as downwardly biasing HIV estimates in
association with criminal provisions.(2) Given these limitations, our findings are suggestive
and point toward the need for better data collection and monitoring as a means of providing
more accurate estimates of HIV prevalence in specific high-risk groups.(3)
Third, measuring sex work policy is difficult because two countries may differ in how strongly
they enforce certain laws or, if they both permit sex work, because of subtle differences in how
they have legalised sex work.(33) In short, our binary or even tripartite distinctions may mask
important variation between and within these categories. To the extent that this measurement
error is randomly distributed across categories this would lead to conservative estimates of
11
 the association. Fourth, the reform of sex work policy has occurred at different times in dif-
ferent countries and our analysis does not account for these temporal differences. However,
again, this is likely to lead to conservative estimates because we are assuming no differences
between exposure to treatment, even though there are large differences between countries.
These should be studied independently in future work.
The causal effect of legalising sex work on HIV prevalence among sex workers remains an
important topic of future research. Studies examining this question may be able to use natural
experiment research designs that exploit policy change within a particular context to test how
these policies affect health (including HIV risk) among sex workers more broadly. For example,
assuming appropriate data were available, the recent adoption of the Nordic model in France
(2016) and Northern Ireland (2015) could be used to examine the short- and long-term health
effects of these policies.
Our work has important policy implications. Legalizing aspects of sex work may reduce HIV
prevalence among sex workers. Further, our evidence suggests that the greatest gains appear
when countries have legalised buying, selling, and procuring sex. But legalizing sex work alone
may be insufficient, unless these laws are administered effectively and fairly. Crucially, legal
reform may not solve these problems on its own, but our data suggest legalisation may be one
important part of a robust and effective response to HIV among sex workers.

HIV prevalence among sex workers
Legal context for sex workers
Sex work is criminal
Aspects of sex work are legal
Notes: Solid black circle is the mean HIV prevalence among sex workers in each legal context. Vertical lines are the
95% confidence intervals. Hollow circles are country specific observations that are outside the 95% confidence
intervals. Outliers above the upper limit are higher among countries that have legalized sex work.

 Web Appendix 5: The legal context of sex work and HIV prevalence among sex workers, ex-
cluding outliers
As shown in web appendix 1, there are some outliers in these data that may be skewing our
results. We re-estimate our models removing observations with standardized residuals greater
than an absolute value of 2, finding that our results remain stable.

 Web Appendix 6: The legal context of sex work and HIV prevalence among sex workers, ad-
justing for ART coverage and the prevalence of HIV in the population
We examine whether our main association is explained by ART coverage or the number of doc-
umented cases of HIV per 1,000,000 people in the population. We find that although both ART
coverage and the prevalence of HIV are associated with HIV prevalence among sex workers,
they do not remove the association between sex work policy and HIV prevalence among sex
workers.

 Web Appendix 7: Sex work policy is associated with HIV prevalence among sex workers, ad-
justing for differences in sample composition and data collection
The focus of this paper is female sex workers but in Bulgaria, Italy, and Norway the ECDC’s
estimates of HIV prevalence include a small number of male and transgender sex workers, who
are known to experience higher rates of HIV. We adjust our main model for these differences
in sample composition, finding that our results are qualitatively similar. In addition, the data
collection procedure differs across countries. Most use an Integrated Bio-Behavioural Survey
(IBBS) but some do not. We again re-estimate our main model but now adjusting whether
countries used IBBS (coded as 0) or not (coded as 1), finding that our results remain stable.

 Web Appendix 8: Association between sex work policy and HIV prevalence among sex
workers, bootstrap procedure
To explore whether specific countries may be influencing our results we use a bootstrap
approach where we re-estimate our main model 27 times. In each iteration we remove one
country and then we plot the coefficient of the association between sex work policy and HIV
from each model.
