IMPORTANCE There are no specifically approved targeted therapies for the most common
genomically defined subset of non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), KRAS-mutant lung cancer.
OBJECTIVE To compare efficacy of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)
inhibitor selumetinib + docetaxel with docetaxel alone as a second-line therapy for advanced
KRAS-mutant NSCLC.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Multinational, randomized clinical trial conducted at
202 sites across 25 countries from October 2013 through January 2016. Of 3323 patients
with advanced NSCLC and disease progression following first-line anticancer therapy tested
for a KRAS mutation, 866 were enrolled and 510 randomized. Primary reason for exclusion
was ineligibility. The data cutoff date for analysis was June 7, 2016.
INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomized 1:1; 254 to receive selumetinib + docetaxel and
256 to receive placebo + docetaxel.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary end point was investigator assessed
progression-free survival. Secondary end points included overall survival, objective response
rate, duration of response, effects on disease-related symptoms, safety, and tolerability.
RESULTS Of 510 randomized patients (mean age, 61.4 years [SD, 8.3]; women, 207 [41%]),
505 patients (99%) received treatment and completed the study (251 received
selumetinib + docetaxel; 254 received placebo + docetaxel). At the time of data cutoff, 447
patients (88%) had experienced a progression event and 346 deaths (68%) had occurred.
Median progression-free survival was 3.9 months (interquartile range [IQR], 1.5-5.9) with
selumetinib + docetaxel and 2.8 months (IQR, 1.4-5.5) with placebo + docetaxel (difference,
1.1 months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.93 [95% CI, 0.77-1.12]; P = .44). Median overall survival was
8.7 months (IQR, 3.6-16.8) with selumetinib + docetaxel and 7.9 months (IQR, 3.8-20.1) with
placebo + docetaxel (difference, 0.9 months; HR, 1.05 [95% CI, 0.85-1.30]; P = .64). Objective
response rate was 20.1% with selumetinib + docetaxel and 13.7% with placebo + docetaxel
(difference, 6.4%; odds ratio, 1.61 [95% CI, 1.00-2.62]; P = .05). Median duration of response
was 2.9 months (IQR, 1.7-4.8; 95% CI, 2.7-4.1) with selumetinib + docetaxel and 4.5 months
(IQR, 2.3-7.3; 95% CI, 2.8-5.6) with placebo + docetaxel. Adverse events of grade 3 or higher
were more frequent with selumetinib + docetaxel (169 adverse events [67%] for
selumetinib + docetaxel vs 115 adverse events [45%] for placebo + docetaxel; difference, 22%).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients with previously treated advanced
KRAS-mutant non–small cell lung cancer, addition of selumetinib to docetaxel did not
improve progression-free survival compared with docetaxel alone.

enotype-directed targeted therapy is the standard of
care for patients with advanced non–small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC).1 However, there are currently no tar-
geted therapies specifically approved for patients with lung
cancers related to a mutation in the v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten Rat

gene, which are detected in approximately 25% of lung ad-
enocarcinoma patients.2 Such patients have a worse progno-

the overall population of patients with NSCLC.3-5
KRAS mutations lead to tumor development and growth
by activating downstream signaling pathways including the
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway involving
MAPK kinase (MEK) and extracellular signal-regulated ki-
nase (ERK).6 The develop-
ment of pharmacological
strategies to directly tar-
get KRAS has proven chal-
lenging; as such, thera-
peutic development has
focused on inhibiting
KRAS effector proteins
downstream, including
MEK. Selumetinib (also
known as AZD6244 or ARRY-142886) is an oral, potent, and se-
lective, allosteric MEK1 and MEK2 inhibitor with a short
half-life.7-9 Studies of single-agent MEK inhibitors have
demonstrated limited efficacy in KRAS-mutant NSCLC.10,11
In contrast, in a randomized phase 2 study (N = 87), selu-
metinib in combination with docetaxel, as a second-line treat-
ment for patients with KRAS-mutant advanced NSCLC, sig-
nificantly improved median progression-free survival and
objective response rate, and numerically improved overall sur-
vival. Median progression-free survival was 5.3 months with
selumetinib + docetaxel and 2.1 months with docetaxel alone
(hazard ratio [HR] for progression with selumetinib, 0.58
[80% CI, 0.42-0.79]; 1-sided P = .01); objective response rate,
37% for selumetinib + docetaxel vs 0% for docetaxel alone
(P < .001); and median overall survival was 9.4 months for
selumetinib + docetaxel vs 5.2 months for docetaxel alone (HR
for death, 0.80 [80% CI, 0.56-1.14]; 1-sided P = .21).12 These en-
couraging findings led to the development and initiation of the
phase 3 Selumetinib Evaluation as Combination Therapy
(SELECT-1;NCT01933932)trial,whichassessedsecond-linese-
lumetinib + docetaxel for patients with KRAS-mutant, lo-
cally advanced or metastatic NSCLC vs placebo + docetaxel.
Methods
Patients
This study included patients 18 years or older, with histo-
logically or cytologically confirmed locally advanced or
metastatic NSCLC (stage IIIB-IV). Patients had failure of 1
previous line of therapy for advanced disease, a centrally
confirmedKRAS-mutanttumor(bycobasKRASMutationTest,
Roche Molecular Systems; which detects codon 12 or 13,
or 61 mutations) and had at least 1 lesion suitable for repeated
measuring by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
(RECIST), version 1.1. Patients also had a World Health Orga-
nization (WHO) performance status of 0 or 1, and provided in-
formed consent prior to any study-specific procedures. Exclu-
sion criteria included mixed small cell and non–small cell lung
cancer histology and presence of brain metastases or spinal
cord compression (unless asymptomatic, treated, stable,
and off steroids and anti-convulsants for ≥4 weeks prior to
screening). Patients were also excluded if they had received
more than 1 prior anticancer drug regimen for advanced or
metastatic NSCLC, or prior treatment with an MEK inhibitor
or any docetaxel-containing regimen. Patients could be pre-
screened if the investigator considered it appropriate for
the patient to consent to central KRAS mutation status screen-
ing of archival tumor material prior to consenting to the main
study. Patient race and ethnicity were recorded to gain a clear
understanding of KRAS-mutant NSCLC across races and eth-
nicities. Patient-reported race and ethnicity were recorded by
the investigator, based on categories including an option for
“other”; race subgroup analyses included only categories
for “white” and “other” and ethnicity subgroup analyses in-
cluded only categories for “Hispanic” and “non-Hispanic.”
Study Oversight
The study was performed in accordance with the ethical prin-
ciplesoftheDeclarationofHelsinki13andtheInternationalCon-
ference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Reg-
istration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use Good Clinical
Practice guidelines. The trial protocol (Supplement 1) was ap-
proved by an institutional review board or ethics committee
at each participating site. All patients provided written in-
formed consent prior to any study-specific procedures.
Study Design
Patients were randomly assigned to treatment in a 1:1 ratio
based on a computer-generated random number, using an
interactive voice or web response system. Patients were
stratified by WHO performance status (0 or 1) and tumor his-
tology (squamous or nonsquamous), and 1 randomization list
was made for each of the 4 randomization strata. A blocked
randomization was generated and all centers used the same
list to minimize any imbalances in the number of patients

Key Points
Question Does the addition of the mitogen-activated protein
kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor selumetinib to chemotherapy lead to
improved outcomes in patients with advanced KRAS-mutant
non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)?
Findings In this randomized clinical trial of 510 patients (254
receiving selumetinib + docetaxel; 256 receiving
placebo + docetaxel), there was no significant improvement in
progression-free survival (median, 3.9 months for
selumetinib + docetaxel vs 2.8 months for placebo + docetaxel).
Meaning Among patients with previously treated advanced
KRAS-mutant NSCLC, addition of selumetinib to docetaxel did not
provide benefit over docetaxel alone.

assigned to each treatment group. Patients were randomized
to receive either 75 mg of selumetinib (hydrogen sulfate)
twice daily on a continuous oral administration schedule in
combination with 75 mg/m2 of docetaxel intravenously on
day 1 of every 21-day cycle or to receive matched placebo plus
docetaxel (same schedule) (Figure 1). All patients received
granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) or, where
available, pegylated G-CSF (pegfilgrastim) starting within 24
hours following each docetaxel administration and not
within 14 days before the next docetaxel dose. Patients
received assigned study treatment until objective disease
progression, intolerable toxicity, or withdrawal of study con-
sent. Patients could continue to receive treatment following
disease progression as long as the investigator considered
them as continuing to derive clinical benefit in the absence of
significant toxicity. Patients and investigators were blinded
to randomized treatment.
End Points and Study Assessments
The primary objective was investigator-assessed progression-
free survival according to RECIST. Secondary objectives in-
cluded overall survival, objective response rate (RECIST), du-
ration of response (RECIST), effects of treatment on disease-
relatedsymptoms(timetosymptomprogressionandsymptom
improvement rate; Average Symptom Burden Index [ASBI]),
safety and tolerability of selumetinib in combination with
docetaxel,andassessmentofselumetinibandN-desmethylse-
lumetinib pharmacokinetics when administered in combina-
tion with docetaxel.
Exploratory objectives included evaluation of the influ-
ence of KRAS mutation subtypes (mutations in codons 12 or
13, or 61 of the KRAS gene using the cobas KRAS Mutation Test,
Roche Molecular Systems); effects of programmed death-
ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression using immunohistochemistry
(PD-L1 IHC 28-8 pharmDx test, Dako) on treatment response;
patient-reported outcomes; and the pharmacokinetics of se-
lumetinib and its metabolite N-desmethyl selumetinib over
time.EffectsofspecificKRASmutationsubtypestatusontreat-
ment efficacy were also assessed, measured by progression-
free survival and objective response rate. Next-generation se-
quencing was performed to determine the specific KRAS
mutation subtype, and patients were assigned to 1 of 2 muta-
tion groups: mutation group 1 included KRAS G12C or KRAS
G12V; mutation group 2 included all other KRAS mutations.14
Tumor evaluations were performed according to RECIST
for all randomized patients using computerized tomography
ormagneticresonanceimagingscansatscreening,week6,and
every 6 weeks thereafter relative to the date of randomiza-
tion. A review of a random sample of scans from 220 evalu-
able patients was performed by blinded independent central
review according to RECIST to assess concordance between in-
vestigator assessments and blinded independent central re-
view. Patients were followed-up for survival status every 8
weeksaftertreatmentdiscontinuationuntilwithdrawalofcon-
sent, death, or the end of the study.

jective using the Lung Cancer Symptom Scale and the 36-Item
Short-Form Health Survey (version 2), prior to any study-
relatedassessmentandatspecifictimepointsduringthestudy.
For patient-reported outcomes, the primary end point was
the time to symptom progression based on the ASBI (loss of
appetite, fatigue, cough, dyspnea, hemoptysis, and pain) from
the Lung Cancer Symptom Scale. Items were scored 0 to 100
and a mean was calculated for overall score. Symptom pro-
gression was defined as an increase in the ASBI score of 10
points or more. Patients with a baseline score more than 90
were excluded from this analysis as they would not be able to
show progression. Seven of the items have the anchors “none”
or “not at all” and “as much as it could be” or “as bad as it could
be.” The loss of appetite item ranges from “as good as it could
be”to“asbadasitcouldbe”andtheglobalhealth-relatedqual-
ity of life item ranges from “very high” to “very low.”
Adverse events were recorded as Medical Dictionary for
Regulatory Activities preferred terms and according to the
National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for
Adverse Events (version 4.03). Adverse events were collected
from the time of informed consent until 30 days (±7) after the
last dose of the last study treatment.
Blood samples were collected for pharmacokinetics as-
sessments at baseline and at week 3 (predose, and 0.5-2 hours,
2.5-4.5 hours, and 6-8 hours after dose).
Sample Size and Statistical Analysis
The statistical analysis plan is available in Supplement 2. The
primary end point was progression-free survival but the
study was sized to be able to characterize the overall survival
benefit of combining selumetinib with docetaxel. Approxi-
mately 500 patients with KRAS-mutant NSCLC who were
randomized 1:1 were required to give the study more than
90% power to demonstrate a statistically significant differ-
ence for progression-free survival with a 1-sided significance
level of 2.5% (2-sided 5%) if the true progression-free sur-
vival HR was 0.58. An increase in overall survival of approxi-
mately 2 months, based on the numerical difference
observed between selumetinib + docetaxel and pla-
cebo + docetaxel in the phase 2 study (7.2 months for selu-
metinib + docetaxel vs 5.2 months for placebo + docetaxel),12
was considered clinically relevant and equates to an HR of
0.72. Randomizing 500 patients with KRAS-mutant NSCLC to
obtain approximately 325 deaths (65% maturity) was esti-
mated to give the study more than 80% power to demon-
strate a statistically significant difference in overall survival,
if the true overall survival HR was 0.72 and assuming a 2%
1-sided significance level. The final analysis was preplanned
to occur when approximately 65% of patients had died (325
events). The significance levels given above are based on a
multiple testing procedure with an α-exhaustive recycling
strategy15 that strongly controlled the type I error at 2.5%
1-sided across primary (progression-free survival) and sec-
ondary (overall survival and objective response rate) end
points. If the primary hypothesis of progression-free survival
was rejected for superiority, the secondary end points would
then be tested in the multiple testing procedure using a
weighted proportion of α. The weighted proportion of α
becomes available after each rejected hypothesis and is

Progression-free survival and overall survival were analyzed
using a stratified log-rank test, with WHO performance sta-
tus (0 or 1) as a stratification factor. For patients who had no
postbaseline assessment or incomplete postbaseline assess-
ments, these patients were classed as nonevaluable and in-
cluded in the “nonresponders” category, so that all patients
were included in the analyses. Procedures for censoring of pa-
tients are presented in the eMethods in Supplement 3. Tumor
histology (nonsquamous or squamous) was also preplanned
as a stratification factor in the analysis but due to the small
number of events observed within the squamous strata it was
not included in the final analyses. Results for progression-

Results
Patients and Treatment
Between October 2013 and January 2016, 3323 patients
signed either the consent or were prescreened at 202
sites across 25 countries (Figure 1). Overall, 866 were en-
rolled and 356 were excluded with the primary reason be-
ing ineligibility. In total, 510 patients were randomized:
254 to the selumetinib + docetaxel group and 256 to the
placebo + docetaxel group. Five hundred and five patients
received treatment: 251 with selumetinib + docetaxel and
254 with placebo + docetaxel. The patient demographics
and baseline disease characteristics were generally well bal-
anced between treatment groups (Table 1). The mean age was
61.4 years, and 207 patients (41%) were women. All patients
had previously received at least 1 prior anticancer drug regi-
men for advanced or metastatic NSCLC. The majority of
patients (94%) had KRAS codon 12 or 13 mutations, and 93%
of patients were former or current smokers and had adeno-
carcinoma histology (91%).
The median number of docetaxel cycles administered in
the selumetinib + docetaxel group was similar (median, 4
cycles [range, 1-16]) to the placebo + docetaxel group (me-
dian, 4 cycles [range, 1-25]). Median duration of randomized
treatment, excluding dose interruption time, with selu-
metinib or placebo was 74 days (range, 3-834) in the selu-
metinib + docetaxel group, and 85 days (range, 5-849 days) in
the placebo + docetaxel group. The relative dose intensity of
docetaxel was similar between the 2 groups over the first 6
cycles of therapy (86.7% in the selumetinib + docetaxel group
and 90.3% in the placebo + docetaxel group). In both groups,
10% of patients (24 in the selumetinib group; 25 in the pla-
cebo group) received more than 6 cycles of docetaxel. In total,
87 patients (35%) in the selumetinib + docetaxel group and 96
patients (38%) in the placebo + docetaxel group received dis-
ease-relatedanticancertherapyafterdiscontinuation,andrates
of specific therapies were similar between groups.
Efficacy
At the time of data cutoff for final analysis (June 7, 2016), 447
patients (88%) had experienced a progression event; 218 pa-
tients (86%) in the selumetinib + docetaxel group and 229 pa-
tients (89%) in the placebo + docetaxel group. At the time of
primary analysis, 4 patients (2%) had censored RECIST pro-
gression and 8 patients (3%) had censored death in the selu-
metinib + docetaxelgroup;6patients(2%)hadcensoreddeath
intheplacebo + docetaxelgroup.Medianprogression-freesur-
vival was 3.9 months (interquartile range [IQR], 1.5-5.9) in the
selumetinib + docetaxel group compared with 2.8 months
(IQR, 1.4-5.5) in the placebo + docetaxel group (difference, 1.1
months; Figure 2). The HR for progression-free survival was
0.93 (95% CI, 0.77-1.12) with a 2-sided P value of .44. Sub-
group analyses of progression-free survival demonstrated no
statistically significant interaction of treatment by subgroup
(eFigure 1 in Supplement 3). A random selection of scans from
220 patients were also assessed by blinded independent cen-
tralreview,whichagreedwithinvestigativesitereviewinterms
of progression or no progression in more than 80% of cases,
and analyses of ascertainment bias supported the consis-
tency of the results based on investigative site review and
blinded independent central review (HR ratio, 1.07 [90% up-
per confidence limit, 1.19]).16
At the data cutoff, 346 death events (68%) had occurred.
Median overall survival was 8.7 months (IQR, 3.6-16.8) in the
selumetinib + docetaxel group (176 events) and 7.9 months
(IQR, 3.8-20.1) in the placebo + docetaxel group (170 events)—
a difference of 0.9 months, with an HR of 1.05 (95% CI,
0.85-1.30); 2-sided P = .64 (Figure 3). Subgroup analyses
of overall survival demonstrated no statistically significant
interaction of treatment by subgroup (eFigure 2 in Sup-
plement 3). Objective response rate was 20.1% (2 complete re-
sponse, 49 partial response) in the selumetinib + docetaxel
group, and 13.7% (0 complete response, 35 partial response)
in the placebo + docetaxel group (difference, 6.4%; odds ra-
tio, 1.61 [95% CI, 1.00-2.62]; 2-sided P = .05) (eFigure 3 in
Supplement 3). Median duration of response was 2.9 months
(IQR, 1.7-4.8; 95% CI, 2.7-4.1) with selumetinib + docetaxel

cebo + docetaxel. One hundred and six patients (42%) in the
selumetinib + docetaxel group, and 95 patients (37%) in
the placebo + docetaxel group had stable disease for 6 weeks
or more. At the time of data cutoff, 29 patients (6%) were re-
ceiving ongoing randomized study treatment (Figure 1).
Adverse Events
The majority of patients experienced at least 1 adverse event
(Table 2). The most commonly reported adverse events in the
selumetinib + docetaxel group were diarrhea (154 events

peripheraledema(76events[30%]).Intheplacebo + docetaxel
group, the most frequent adverse events were diarrhea
(89 events [35%]), fatigue (79 events [31%]), alopecia (64
events [25%]), and nausea (62 events [24%]). Grade 3 or
higher adverse events were reported more frequently in
the selumetinib + docetaxel group (169 events [67%])
than the placebo + docetaxel group (115 events [45%]; differ-
ence, 22%). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 4 patients
(2%) in the selumetinib + docetaxel group and 2 patients
(1%) in the placebo + docetaxel group. All were reported as
grade 3 or higher, with the exception of 1 event in the pla-
cebo + docetaxel group. Adverse events causally related
to randomized treatment are shown in eTable 1 in Supple-
ment 3. More patients in the selumetinib + docetaxel group
(49%) reported serious adverse events compared with the
placebo + docetaxel group (32%). In total, 116 patients (46%)
in the selumetinib + docetaxel and 76 patients (30%) in the
placebo + docetaxel groups had adverse events leading
to hospitalization. There were 346 deaths in this study;
313 were considered by the investigator to be related to un-
derlying NSCLC, 10 due to adverse events, 17 related to both
disease and an adverse event, and 6 related to other causes of
death. The number and causes of death were balanced be-
tween treatment groups.
Dose reductions of selumetinib or placebo were required
in 70 patients (28%) in the selumetinib + docetaxel group and
16 patients (6%) in the placebo + docetaxel group; interrup-
tions of selumetinib or placebo were required in 103 patients
(41%) in the selumetinib + docetaxel group and 53 patients
(21%) in the placebo + docetaxel group. Dose reductions of
docetaxel were required in 41 patients (16%) in the selu-
metinib + docetaxel group and 25 patients (10%) in the pla-
cebo + docetaxel group; docetaxel dose delays were required

Pharmacokinetics
Plasma concentrations of selumetinib and its N-desmethyl
metabolite were analyzed using a population pharmacokinet-
ics approach and were comparable with previous studies
(eFigure 4 in Supplement 3).12

Influence of KRAS Mutation Subtypes
Of the 510 patients randomized, 13 samples were excluded
from the KRAS mutation group analysis set because the sub-
type of the confirmed KRAS mutation could not be identified,
and an additional patient had no tumor sample available
for next-generation sequencing analysis. Overall, 496
patients were included in the KRAS mutation group analysis
set (mutation group 1 [KRAS G12C or KRAS G12V], 301
patients; mutation group 2 [all other KRAS mutations], 195
patients); patients were similarly distributed between treat-
ments in both mutation groups. Fifteen patients had multiple
KRAS mutations and were excluded from the progression-
free survival analysis (n = 481); no differences were observed

in progression-free survival between treatments by mutation
group or by individual KRAS mutation subtype (eFigure 6 in
Supplement 3). In mutation group 1, objective response rate
was greater in the selumetinib + docetaxel group compared
with the placebo + docetaxel group, however this was not
translated into a meaningful progression-free survival ben-
efit (eTable 3 in Supplement 3). There were no differences in
objective response rate between treatments in mutation
group 2.
Patient-Reported Outcomes
There was no statistically significant effect of selumetinib on
time to symptom progression (HR, 0.90 [95% CI, 0.73-1.11],
P = .32; eFigure 5 in Supplement 3) or symptom improve-
ment rates (odds ratio, 1.17 [95% CI, 0.74-1.86]).
Discussion
In the SELECT-1 trial, selumetinib + docetaxel did not im-
prove progression-free survival or overall survival in pa-
tients with advanced KRAS-mutant NSCLC compared
with placebo + docetaxel. Median progression-free survival
was 3.9 months in the selumetinib + docetaxel group and 2.8
months in the placebo + docetaxel group, whereas median
overall survival was 8.7 months in the selumetinib + docetaxel
group vs 7.9 months in the placebo + docetaxel group. Grade
3 or higher adverse events were more frequent with selu-
metinib + docetaxel (67%) than placebo + docetaxel (45%).
The results of this study differ from those observed in a
prior smaller randomized phase 2 trial with the same
design.12 Efficacy in the control group was greater in the
phase 3 trial compared with the phase 2 trial (objective
response rate, 14% in the phase 3 trial vs 0% in the phase 2
trial; progression-free survival, 2.8 months in the phase 3
trial vs 2.1 months in the phase 2 trial). Conversely, the
experimental group performed worse in the phase 3 trial
compared with that of the phase 2 trial (objective response
rate, 20% in the phase 3 trial vs 37% in the phase 2 trial;
progression-free survival 3.9 months in the phase 3 trial vs
5.3 months in the phase 2 trial). The differences were
unlikely to be influenced by the study design, which was the
same in both cases; or by geography, because both were con-
ducted in multiple regions around the world. The treatment
regimen was better tolerated in the phase 3 trial given the
mandatory use of G-CSF, which led to a lower incidence of
neutropenia and febrile neutropenia in the current study
(Table 2) compared with the prior phase 2 trial.12
To our knowledge, SELECT-1 is the largest randomized
trial for patients with KRAS-mutant NSCLC performed to
date. However, not all KRAS mutations are functionally the
same, and the genomic context in which KRAS mutations
occur may also influence therapeutic efficacy. Approximately
one-third of KRAS-mutant cancers harbor concurrent muta-
tions in TP53 and another one-third have concurrent muta-
tions in LKB1.17,18 A much smaller fraction harbor both con-
comitant TP53 and LKB1 mutations whereas the remaining
portion harbor neither concomitant mutation.17,18 A
co-clinical trial in mice demonstrated that although the addi-
tion of selumetinib to docetaxel significantly improved the
response rate in KrasG12D and KrasG12D/p53−/− mice, this was
not the case for KrasG12D/Lkb1−/− mice.19 The presence of
either concomitant loss of p53 or Lkb1 also blunted the effi-
cacy of docetaxel compared with mice with only KrasG12D.19

Increased sensitivity to MEK inhibition has also been dem-
onstrated in KRAS-mutant NSCLC cell lines with concomi-
tant LKB1 inactivation using the MEK inhibitor CI-1040.20
KRAS mutations represent the largest genomically de-
fined subset of lung cancer. There remains a great need to de-
velopeffectivetherapiesforthissubsetofpatientsandthefind-
ingsfromthepresentstudyfurtherhighlightthis.Patientswith
advanced KRAS-mutant NSCLC benefit from anti–pro-
grammed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitors including niv-
olumab, similarly to the general population of NSCLC
patients.21 The benefit of anti–PD-1 therapy for patients with
KRAS mutations may reflect the incidence of high PD-L1 ex-
pression in KRAS-mutant tumors.22 Although PD-L1 expres-
sion is used as a biomarker to select patients for anti–PD-1
therapy, it did not affect the efficacy observed in this study
(eTable 2 in Supplement 3).21 Recent preclinical studies have
identified inhibitors that can directly target KRAS.23 Based on
in vitro studies, these inhibitors appear to have potential, and
to date are selective for KRAS G12C, which represents the larg-
est subset of KRAS-mutant NSCLC.6
Limitations
There were several limitations in this study. Although the
present trial was a randomized study, and hence should lead
to a minimization of any imbalances, it is possible that dif-
ferences in the distribution of concomitant genomic altera-
tions, alongside KRAS mutations, contribute to the findings
and to the differences observed between the phase 2 and
phase 3 trials. Similarly, the particular codon 12 KRAS muta-
tions may predict for differential sensitivity to MEK inhibi-
tors. Preclinical studies suggest that cell lines harboring
KRAS G12C or KRAS G12V mutations may have a greater
dependence upon MAPK signaling and hence be more sensi-
tive to MEK inhibitors. A subset analysis from the prior ran-
domized phase 2 trial suggested a differential benefit for the
selumetinib combination in patients with KRAS G12C or
KRAS G12V mutations.14 However, we were unable to con-
firm this differential benefit in the present study. A further
limitation is that the lack of efficacy of docetaxel in the
phase 2 trial,12 from which results were used in the power-
ing of the present study, may have led to an overestimation
of the benefit of adding selumetinib to docetaxel. In a phase
2 randomized trial of trametinib compared with docetaxel,
the response rate to docetaxel was 12% and the progression-
free survival was 2.5 months, similar to the findings of the
control group in the present study. Better performance of
patients receiving placebo + docetaxel in the present study
compared with the phase 2 trial may be explained by the
administration of prophylactic G-CSF to all patients in the
SELECT-1 trial, which is not part of routine clinical practice
for docetaxel monotherapy administration in this patient
population.
Conclusions
Among patients with previously treated advanced KRAS-
mutant non–small cell lung cancer, addition of selumetinib to
docetaxel did not improve progression-free survival com-
pared with docetaxel alone.
