Summary
Background The ability of individuals to use HIV self-tests correctly is debated. To inform the 2016 WHO 
recommendation on HIV self-testing, we assessed the reliability and performance of HIV rapid diagnostic tests when 
used by self-testers.
Methods In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, PopLine, and Embase, conference 
abstracts, and additional grey literature between Jan 1, 1995, and April 30, 2016, for observational and experimental 
studies reporting on HIV self-testing performance. We excluded studies evaluating home specimen collection because 
patients did not interpret their own test results. We extracted data independently, using standardised extraction forms. 
Outcomes of interest were agreement between self-testers and health-care workers, sensitivity, and specificity. We 
calculated κ to establish the level of agreement and pooled κ estimates using a random-effects model, by approach 
(directly assisted or unassisted) and type of specimen (blood or oral fluid). We examined heterogeneity with the 
I² statistic.
Findings 25 studies met inclusion criteria (22 to 5662 participants). Quality assessment with QUADAS-2 showed studies 
had low risk of bias and incomplete reporting in accordance with the STARD checklist. Raw proportion of agreement 
ranged from 85·4% to 100%, and reported κ ranged from fair (κ 0·277, p<0·001) to almost perfect (κ 0·99, n=25). 
Pooled κ suggested almost perfect agreement for both types of approaches (directly assisted 0·98, 95% CI 0·96–0·99 
and unassisted 0·97, 0·96–0·98; I²=34·5%, 0–97·8). Excluding two outliers, sensitivity and specificity was higher for 
blood-based rapid diagnostic tests (4/16) compared with oral fluid rapid diagnostic tests (13/16). The most common 
error that affected test performance was incorrect specimen collection (oral swab or finger prick). Study limitations 
included the use of different reference standards and no disaggregation of results by individuals taking antiretrovirals.
Interpretation Self-testers can reliably and accurately do HIV rapid diagnostic tests, as compared with trained health-
care workers. Errors in performance might be reduced through the improvement of rapid diagnostic tests for 
self-testing, particularly to make sample collection easier and to simplify instructions for use.

Introduction
Interest in HIV self-testing—an approach to increase 
access to HIV testing—has increased since 2014.1 As a 
discreet and convenient approach, HIV self-testing 
might be most useful in reaching people who are 
reluctant or unable to access existing HIV testing 
services because of concerns about privacy, stigma, 
discrimination, and, in some contexts, criminalisation. 
According to various studies,2–7 HIV self-testing is 
highly acceptable among many different population 
groups, including those with low testing coverage and 
who report barriers to and low uptake of existing HIV 
testing services. Despite this, some policy makers and 
users have raised concerns that self-testers might not 
be able to do the test or interpret the test results 
correctly.1
We did a systematic review to assess the reliability and 
performance of HIV rapid diagnostic tests when used 
by self-testers, compared with health-care workers. 
Although previous reviews assessed the accuracy of 
rapid diagnostic tests for self-testing,8,9 they primarily 
focused on sensitivity and specificity and did not 
consider the validity of the reference standard. Thus, we 
systematically measure and report test concordance 
between self-testers and health-care workers to account 
for imperfect reference standards to establish the 
reliability and performance of rapid diagnostic tests 
used for self-testing.

Methods 
Search strategy and selection criteria
This systematic review and meta-analysis followed the 
PRISMA standards (appendix pp 1–2). We searched 
PubMed, PopLine, and Embase for studies published from 
Jan 1, 1995, to April 30, 2016. We also reviewed six electronic 
HIV
/AIDS conference databases (ie, Conference on 
Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections, International 
AIDS Conference, International AIDS Society, American 
Public Health Association, National HIV Prevention 
Conference, and the HIV Diagnostics Conference) for all 
available years (appendix p 3).
We searched for grey literature through Google 
Scholar (first 100 titles of 201 results). We screened 
bibliographies of included articles and purposely 
selected and contacted experts (ie, academic researchers 
with ongoing studies on HIV self-testing) to identify 
additional sources. We contacted authors of relevant 
studies (up to two attempts) to retrieve relevant study 
information. We placed no language, age, study type, or 
geographical limitations on the search.
We included studies reporting the performance of 
rapid diagnostic tests by self-testers and those reporting 
the concordance or the sensitivity and specificity of rapid 
diagnostic tests compared with the results of testing 
done by a health-care worker. Two reviewers (CF, CJ) 
screened records independently and resolved dis-
agreements through discussion and consensus.
We defined HIV self-testing as a process where an 
individual collects his or her specimen, does a test, and 
interprets their own test result.1 In the directly 
assisted approach, self-testers received an in-person 
demonstration of how to do the test or to interpret the 
test result; in the unassisted approach, self-testers were 
provided only with manufacturers’ instructions for use 
included in the kit. All self-testers, irrespective of type of 
approach used, could access or receive assistance over 
the phone, through the internet, or with additional 
instructions (eg, videos, animations, or diagrams).10 We 
did not consider HIV counselling, linkage to care, and 
referral information as part of HIV self-testing 
assistance.10 We considered observed studies when 
participants were directly observed or video recorded to 
evaluate their HIV self-testing performance.
We excluded studies reporting on home specimen 
collection, concordance or sensitivity and specificity of 
self-testing, or self-monitoring devices for conditions 
other than HIV.
We defined the testing strategy used to establish the 
reference result as any testing sequence used to identify 
HIV infection (appendix pp 4–7). We classified testing 
strategies as aligned or not aligned with WHO guidance 
on the basis of the 2015 Consolidated guidelines on HIV 
testing services.11
Data analysis
We defined measures of concordance (inter-reader 
reliability) as the percentage agreement and Cohen’s κ12 
between the health-care worker and the self-tester.
We defined measurements of accuracy as specificity 
and sensitivity. HIV positivity among participants was 
based on the number of HIV-positive participants with 
known status or who received an HIV-positive diagnosis 
during the study. HIV positivity was then categorised as 
high (≥5%) or low (<5%).11
Given the imperfect or absent reference standards 
among studies, to evaluate performance of HIV rapid 
diagnostic tests used by self-testers we first assessed 
whether the result of the index and the reference test 
agreed or disagreed.13 We then calculated the raw 
estimates of sensitivity and specificity.
We extracted data for true reactive, true non-reactive, 
false reactive, and false non-reactive results to calculate κ 
and raw estimates of sensitivity and specificity, and 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
To diagnose HIV, at least two or three tests, depending on the 
HIV prevalence among the population being tested, are needed. 
The validity of using a single test as a reference standard is 
imperfect. Previous systematic reviews focused on sensitivity 
and specificity of HIV rapid diagnostic tests for self-testing. An 
initial search of PubMed, for studies published from Jan 1, 1995, 
to Jan 26, 2016, with the search terms “HIV self-testing” and 
“review”, indicated that the validity of the reference standard 
has not been considered previously.
Added value of this study
To inform a WHO recommendation, we assessed the reliability 
and performance of HIV rapid diagnostic tests used by 
self-testers compared with health-care workers, by calculating 
statistics on test concordance to account for the imperfect 
reference standard. We included studies that used products 
designed for self-testing in diverse country settings. Previous 
reviews were done when HIV self-testing was emerging; these 
reviews primarily drew from US and European studies that used 
professional-use products or prototypes that have since been 
adapted for HIV self-testing.
Implications of all the available evidence
Self-testers could reliably and accurately do an HIV rapid 
diagnostic test, whether assistance was provided or not, when 
compared with a trained health-care worker. Errors in the test 
procedure might be reduced by refinement of the design of 
rapid diagnostic tests for self-testing, improvement of 
manufacturer labelling and instructions for use, and provision 
of additional support with instructional videos. Modifications 
should always be the responsibility of the manufacturer.

explored the effect for oral fluid and blood-based rapid 
diagnostic tests separately, by type of assistance (direct 
assistance or no assistance) and type of observation. We 
calculated raw estimates of sensitivity and specificity 
with Meta-DiSc software;14 we did not consider invalid or 
indeterminate values to avoid skewness of results.
We determined quality of studies using the Standards 
for Reporting Studies of Diagnostic Accuracy (STARD) 
checklist,15 and the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic 
Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2).16 We considered high 
risk of partial verification bias if more than 10% of study 
participants did not have their HIV test results and status 
confirmed, and if the selection of patients to receive the 
reference standard was not randomised. We considered a 
study to have a high risk of differential verification bias if 
more than 10% of patients received testing with a 
different reference standard. CF scored studies for 
quality in terms of risk of bias and concerns regarding 
applicability.
Given the high study variability and the inclusion of 
multiple reference standards, we pooled κ estimates 
using a random-effects model with the R package 
metaphor, version 3.4.4.13 We assessed heterogeneity by 
visual inspection of forest plots and calculation of the I² 
statistic (>25–50% moderate).17

Results
After screening and removing duplicates, we included 
25 studies4,6,18–40 in the review (figure 1). All studies4,6,18–40 
evaluated 
concordance, 
15 
studies4,6,18–20,22,26–28,30–32,34,36,38 
evaluated sensitivity and specificity, and one25 only evaluated 
sensitivity. 15 studies4,6,18,20,24,26,28,30–36,38 used oral fluid-based 
rapid diagnostic tests, six21,22,25,27,37,40 used blood-based rapid 
diagnostic tests, and four19,23,29,39 used both.
13 studies4,19,22–28,31–33,39 reported on unassisted HIV self-
testing, 116,18,20,29,30,34–38,40 reported on directly assisted HIV 
self-testing, and one21 reported on both approaches 
(table 1). 23 of 25 studies were observational in design 
(three cohort,4,6,19 18 cross-sectional,21–29,32–40 and two cross-
sectional and qualitative20,30), and two were randomised 
controlled trials.18,31 Sample size varied from 22 to 
5662 participants. HIV positivity among participants was 
available in 28 reports from 22 studies; 19 (68%) of 
28 reports had a high HIV positivity,4,6,18,20,22,25–32,36,39 and 
eight (29%) had low HIV positivity.4,19,23,24,33–35,38 Reference 
test strategy was not available in five of 25 studies, or was 
not aligned with WHO testing guidance in another 
five studies (appendix pp 4–7). 16 (64%) of 25 studies 
were considered to be at low risk of bias and applicability 
across all key domains for QUADAS-2 (appendix p 8). 17 
(68%) of 25 studies also failed to fulfil at least 60% of the 
STARD criteria, with a mean of 16·2 available items out 
of 34 (appendix pp 9–34).
Of the 25 studies evaluating concordance between the 
result of an HIV rapid diagnostic test used by a self-tester 
compared with a result obtained by a health-care worker, 
184,6,18–24,28,29,31,33–35,37,39,40 reported raw percentage of agree-
ment, three26,27,32 reported a κ statistic, and four23,30,36,38 
reported both (table 2).
Reported κ ranged from fair (κ 0·277, p<0·001) to 
almost perfect (κ 0·99).23,26,27,30,32,36,38 The raw proportion of 
agreement was high, ranging from 85·4% to 100%. 
Overall, our estimates of pooled agreement across studies 
were almost perfect for both types of approaches (directly 
assisted κ 0·98, 95% CI 0·96 to 0·99; unassisted κ 0·97, 
0·96 to 0·98; I²=34·5%, 0 to 97·8; figure 2). Pooled 
estimates according to whether HIV self-testing was 
observed or not also had almost perfect agreement 
(observed 0·98, 0·96 to 0·99; unobserved 0·96, 
0·94 to 0·99; I²=43·0%, 38·8 to 98·4; figure 2). The 
lowest estimated agreement (κ 0·47, –0·04 to 0·97) was in 
rural Zimbabwe; the study investigators attributed poor 
performance to low literacy in the population tested, and 
verbose instructions that needed further optimisation.31
The proportion of disagreements, assuming the self-
tester perspective compared with health-care worker, 
ranged from 0% to 14·6%. Across 29 reports from

25 studies, four reports24,25,33,35 found no difference in 
interpretation between self-testers and health-care 
workers. Most reported differences resulted from the 
interpretation of a reactive result as non-reactive 
(0·01–4·8%, 13 of 29 reports), a reactive result as invalid 
(2·7–6·7%, five of 29), a non-reactive result as 
reactive (0·1–4·5%, 14 of 29), an invalid result as reactive 
(0·5–3·1%, three of 29), an invalid result as non-reactive 
(0·3–12·5%, 13 of 29), or a non-reactive result as 
invalid (0·5–50%, seven of 29).
Reasons for disagreements were higher in directly 
assisted studies (2·7–6·7%) than unassisted studies 
(4·6%) when interpreting a reactive result as invalid, 
and were higher in unassisted studies (0·01–4·8%) than 
directly assisted studies (0·06–2·7%) when interpreting 
a reactive result as non-reactive.
Across 20 reports from 16 studies,4,6,18–20,22,25–28,30–32,34,36,38 
16 (80%) of 20 reports had specificity of more than 98%. 
Sensitivity varied substantially; 18 (90%) of 20 reports had 
sensitivity of at least 80%. Two studies reported sensitivity 
of less than 80%: one34 had insufficient information on 
how to interpret faint positive lines, and the other31 
suggested lengthy instructions were a barrier to

lower than the urban arm. Excluding these two studies,31,34 
sensitivity estimates were higher for blood-based rapid 
diagnostic tests (96·2–100%)19,22,25,27 than oral fluid-based 
rapid diagnostic tests (80–100%),4,6,18,20,26,28,30–32,36,38 as were 
specificity estimates (blood-based 99·5–100% vs oral fluid 
95·1–100%). Studies4,6,18,22,25–28,30–32,36,38 in which testing was 
observed reported a modest difference in sensitivity 
(80–100%) compared with unobserved studies4,18–20,34 
(88·9–100%; table 3).
A study31 from Zimbabwe with oral fluid-based rapid 
diagnostic tests, with data disaggregated by setting, 
found that urban populations had higher sensitivity 
(80%, 95% CI 28·4–99·5) than rural populations with 
lower literacy (66·7%, 9·4–99·2), and that this was also 
the case for specificity (urban 97·8%, 88·5–99·9 vs rural 
94·7%, 85·4–98·9).
All studies6,18,20,30,34,36,38 addressing directly assisted HIV 
self-testing used oral fluid-based rapid diagnostic tests. 
The estimated sensitivity was similar to that in 
studies4,19,26,28,31,32 with oral fluid rapid diagnostic tests 
within the unassisted approach (table 3).
Three studies included some participants taking 
antiretroviral drugs. In two studies,6,31 participants had 
non-reactive test results, but later received confirmatory 
testing and were diagnosed or disclosed their HIV 
statuses afterward. In the third study,23 self-testers and 
health-care workers both obtained non-reactive results 
because they used the same oral test.
We identified 25 reports from 20 studies with 
information on invalid results: seven reports20,29–32,36,40 used 
the directly assisted approach, six23,25,26,28,34,39 used the 
unassisted approach and two4,18 used both approaches.

using blood-based rapid diagnostic tests (0·4–9·5%) 
than studies4,18,20,23,26,28,30–32,36,38 using oral fluid-based rapid 
diagnostic tests (0·2–4·5%). Excluding studies21,25–27,29,39 
with feasibility of less than 60%, the proportion of invalid 
results was less than 5% (0·2–4·6%), regardless of the 
approach or specimen.
User errors described in studies of the directly 
assisted approach were incorrect or incomplete 
specimen collection (finger prick or oral swab),20,21,30,31,40 
incorrect use or spillage of buffer,20,29–31,36,40 incorrect 
transfer of blood specimen, and problems with the 
interpretation of results.4,20,23,30,34,39,40 Reported errors in 
studies of the unassisted approach included specimen 
collection 
(finger 
prick 
or 
oral 
swab),23,26,28 
misinterpretation of test results,23,34 incorrect time to 
read the results,26,28 test kit opened incorrectly,23,26 
incorrect use or spillage of buffer,28 instructions not 
followed or read,23 or incorrect transfer of the blood 
specimen.25
In general, reported errors in performance were similar 
by type of specimen; however, studies using oral fluid 
rapid diagnostic tests reported errors in the interpretation 
of test results and studies using blood-based rapid 
diagnostic tests reported errors in transfer of the blood 
specimen.
Two studies4,25 found that people with known HIV status 
had a higher proportion of errors (ie, when collecting the 
specimen) when self-testing compared with people with 
unknown HIV status (0·8% vs 0·2%),whereas a third 
study27 found that known HIV-positive participants were 
more likely to do the test correctly.
Discussion
Self-testers can achieve the same results as health-care 
workers when using HIV rapid diagnostic tests and 
diagnostic accuracy of rapid diagnostic tests for self-testing 
is high. Application of the estimated ranges of sensitivity 
(80–100%) and specificity (95·1–100%) to a hypothetical 
group of 100 000 people with 1% of HIV prevalence would 
result in 0–200 HIV-positive cases being missed, and 
0–4851 HIV-negative individuals being misidentified with 
a reactive result, excluding two outliers.31,34
This systematic review and meta-analysis suggests that 
in the hands of self-testers, the sensitivity and specificity 
of blood-based rapid diagnostic tests were higher than 
oral fluid rapid diagnostic tests, although fewer studies 
used blood-based rapid diagnostic tests. The reduced 
sensitivity is probably explained by the lower quantity of 
HIV antibodies in oral fluid compared with whole blood, 
as observed in professional-use assessments.41 Although

blood-based rapid diagnostic tests might have the 
potential to deliver more accurate results, more invalid 
results might occur because the greatest number of user 
errors was related to standard procedures when capillary 
tubes and pipettes were used.
 Most studies had a high HIV positivity among 
participants where tests are expected to have a higher 
positive-predictive value than lower prevalence popul-
ations. Furthermore, imperfect reference standards 
might also decrease the degree of accuracy. We found 
wide variability in sensitivity estimates, which could be 
explained by the use of adapted rapid diagnostic tests not 
specifically designed for self-test use,21–23,25,27,37,39,40 or used 
test kits before approval by national regulatory authorities, 
in 23 of 25 included studies.4,19,20,24,26,28–36,38
When we excluded six studies21,25–27,29,39 with low 
feasibility, the proportion of invalid results met the 
minimum acceptable criteria for rapid diagnostic test 
performance (<5%);42 however, we still found no 
significant differences in the proportion of invalid results 
by type of approach, suggesting that use of a rapid 
diagnostic tests for self-testing without assistance will 
not increase the possibility of obtaining an invalid result.
Most invalid results and errors in performance reported 
by studies included in this review related to user errors 
and manufacturing defects. These invalid results and 
errors can be mitigated with instructions for use because 
the complexity of the test procedure or the complexity of 
the instructions can increase the possibility of failure in 
performance and incorrect interpretation of a result.
Recommendations include use of simple and clear 
language and well designed pictorial instructions, 
especially for the steps related to specimen collection, 
buffer use, and interpretation of results;43 easily iden-
tifiable kit components; reduction of the volume of 
specimen needed to do the test; and intuitive single-step 
test kits with controlled and automatic specimen 
collection, transfer, and buffer use.
In some settings, instructions could be adapted and 
validated for the cultural context and for less-skilled users, 
including individuals with low literacy or visual 
impairments. This could include translation in local 
languages, clear and large print instructions for use, 
detailed images and descriptions, or electronic documents 
or audio instructions. To improve performance of less-
skilled users, instructions for use could be coupled with 
in-person or video demonstrations on how to do the test 
and interpret the result.
Product labelling should clearly state that people with 
reactive or invalid test results should seek further 
testing at a health facility. The labelling should also 
include information on test limitations in detecting 
HIV infection during the window period, for people 
taking pre-exposure prophylaxis, or in people with a 
suppressed immune response, such as people on 
antiretroviral drugs. This is a crucial issue because 
reports show that people with HIV on antiretrovial 
therapy might be using HIV self-testing kits to check 
and reconfirm their HIV status, and could obtain a 
false-negative result.44,45
Strengths of this study include completeness of the 
search strategy, explicit inclusion criteria, a systematic 
approach to data collection, and independent assessment 
of each included study. Among the limitations were that 
most included studies used oral fluid-based rapid 
diagnostic tests, and studies used different and imperfect 
reference standard tests to identify HIV-positive 
individuals. Most studies did not compare approaches or 
specimens head-to-head. Results were considered biased 
in studies where the reference test strategy was not 
aligned with WHO testing guidance. Our last search was 
done on April 30, 2016, and since then 11 studies 
reporting on HIV self-testing performance have been 
published,46–56 of which eight are abstracts. These studies 
reached the same conclusion as we did, reporting that 
most participants were able to do the self-test correctly, 
and, where reported, the raw proportion of agreement 
was also high, ranging from 84% to 99%.45,46,48,49,55 Six of 
11 studies would not have met our inclusion criteria, and 
the four that did meet the inclusion criteria might not 
have influenced our findings. Furthermore, most studies 
used adapted test kits that were not specifically designed 
or packaged for self-testing, and in some studies 
participants did not interpret their own results, but 
interpreted contrived devices or pictures or photographs.
No study provided information on people recently or 
acutely infected with HIV, and no study disaggregated 
data by individuals taking antiretroviral drugs. Because 
little data were available, we could not explore the 
influence of HIV prevalence, type of reference used, or 
study design. Selection bias is likely because most 
studies carefully selected participants; some studies 
included only known HIV-positive individuals. We did 
not assess publication bias because analytical methods 
are not well suited for testing observational data.57 
Finally, although most studies were judged to be at low 
risk of bias, concerns remained about studies with 
small samples and the extent to which the findings can 
be generalised.
 In summary, self-testers can achieve a high level of 
agreement with the results obtained by a health-care 
worker when using an HIV rapid diagnostic test for self-
testing, whether or not assistance was provided. Errors in 
performance of the test procedure might be reduced 
through improvement of the design of rapid diagnostic 
tests for self-testing, clearer product labels, inclusion of 
simple instructions for use, and provision of additional 
support, such as instructional videos.

of the manuscript. All authors collaboratively discussed key decisions 
throughout the course of the review, provided critical feedback on 
preliminary drafts and interpretation of results, and approved the final 
manuscript.
