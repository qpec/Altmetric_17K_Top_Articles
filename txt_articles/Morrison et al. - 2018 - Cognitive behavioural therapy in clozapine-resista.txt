Summary
Background Although clozapine is the treatment of choice for treatment-refractory schizophrenia, 30–40% of patients 
have an insufficient response, and others are unable to tolerate it. Evidence for any augmentation strategies is scarce. 
We aimed to determine whether cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment for clozapine-resistant 
schizophrenia.
Methods We did a pragmatic, parallel group, assessor-blinded, randomised controlled trial in community-based and 
inpatient mental health services in five sites in the UK. Patients with schizophrenia who were unable to tolerate 
clozapine, or whose symptoms did not respond to the drug, were randomly assigned 1:1 by use of randomised-
permuted blocks of size four or six, stratified by centre, to either CBT plus treatment as usual or treatment as usual 
alone. Research assistants were masked to allocation to protect against rater bias and allegiance bias. The primary 
outcome was the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score at 21 months, which provides a 
continuous measure of symptoms of schizophrenia; PANSS total was also assessed at the end of treatment (9 months). 
The primary analysis was by randomised treatment based on intention to treat, for all patients for whom data were 
available. This study was prospectively registered, number ISRCTN99672552. The trial is closed to accrual.
Findings From Jan 1, 2013, to May 31, 2015, we randomly assigned 487 participants to either CBT and treatment as 
usual (n=242) or treatment as usual alone (n=245). Analysis included 209 in the CBT group and 216 in the treatment 
as usual group. No difference occurred in the primary outcome (PANSS total at 21 months, mean difference –0·89, 
95% CI –3·32 to 1·55; p=0·48), although the CBT group improved at the end of treatment (PANSS total at 9 months, 
mean difference –2·40, –4·79 to –0·02; p=0·049). During the trial, 107 (44%) of 242 participants in the CBT arm and 
104 (42%) of 245 in the treatment as usual arm had at least one adverse event (odds ratio 1·09, 95% CI 0·81 to 1·46; 
p=0·58). Only two (1%) of 242 participants in the CBT arm and one (<1%) of 245 in the treatment as usual arm had a 
trial-related serious adverse event.
Interpretation At 21-month follow-up, CBT did not have a lasting effect on total symptoms of schizophrenia compared 
with treatment as usual; however, CBT produced statistically, though not clinically, significant improvements on total 
symptoms by the end of treatment. There was no indication that the addition of CBT to treatment as usual caused 
adverse effects. The results of this trial do not support a recommendation to routinely offer CBT to all people who 
meet criteria for clozapine-resistant schizophrenia; however, a pragmatic individual trial might be indicated for some.

Introduction
Schizophrenia is associated with significant personal, 
social, and economic costs. The mortality risk associated 
with schizophrenia is also a major concern—eg, a recent 
systematic review and meta-analysis found that people 
with a diagnosis of schizophrenia die an average 
of 14·5 years earlier than those without diagnosed 
schizophrenia.1 About a third of people with a diagnosis 
of schizophrenia respond poorly to standard treatment 
with 
antipsychotic 
medica 
tion. 
Treatment-resistant 
schizophrenia is defined as schizophrenia treated over 
two periods with different antipsychotics at an adequate 
dose for at least 4 weeks, and symptoms are not reduced 
by at least 20%.2 8 million people are estimated to have 
treatment-resistant schizophrenia.3 For people meeting 
diagnostic criteria for treatment-resistant schizophrenia, 
economic costs are greater because of longer-term 
residential and intensive community treatment,4 quality 
of life is 20% lower,5 and community functioning is 
poorer than those individuals with a diagnosis of 
schizophrenia that is not resistant to treatment with 
antipsychotic medication.6

Clozapine is generally considered the treatment of choice 
for people with treatment-resistant schizophrenia,7 which 
is reflected in recommendations in clinical guidelines. 
However, 30–40% of patients show an inadequate response 
to clozapine.8 Debate exists about the superiority of 
clozapine for treatment-resistant schizophrenia, with one 
network meta-analysis finding clozapine to be equivalent 
to many other antipsychotics for treatment-resistant 
schizophrenia.9 However, another meta-analysis found 
clozapine to be superior to all other antipsychotics for 
positive symptoms.10
Some people cannot tolerate clozapine; serious 
side-effects 
include 
seizures 
and 
agranulocytosis. 
Poor response to clozapine, termed clozapine-resistant 
schizophrenia, is defined as inadequate response to 
treatment for at least 12 weeks at a stable dose of 400 mg or 
more per day, unless limited by side-effects. The most 
common treatment of clozapine-resistant schizophrenia is 
augmentation with another antipsychotic medication.11 
Although meta-analyses have found some evidence of 
small benefits of such augmentation,12–14 this evidence is 
limited by few, small, low-quality studies. A small study 
examined the effects of augmentation with electro-
convulsive therapy in 39 participants, but this was of short 
duration (8 weeks).15
Several meta-analyses of cognitive behavioural therapy 
(CBT) have found small to moderate effects on psychotic 
symptoms when delivered in combination with anti-
psychotic medications.16–18 However, conclusions regarding 
the efficacy of CBT are claimed to be mistaken, since most 
large, well conducted trials have not shown a significant 
effect at the end of treatment and the effect sizes are 
reduced overall if meta-analyses are limited to studies of 
high quality.17 The efficacy of augmentation of clozapine 
with CBT for clozapine-resistant schizophrenia is 
unknown, since only one small unrandomised trial has 
investigated this. 19
The Focusing On Clozapine Unresponsive Symptoms 
(FOCUS) trial aimed to determine whether CBT is 
clinically effective for people with clozapine-resistant 
schizophrenia. We hypothesised that CBT plus treatment 
as usual would reduce the psychiatric symptoms of 
schizophrenia, improve quality of life, and improve user-
defined recovery over a 21-month follow-up period 
compared with treatment as usual alone.
Methods
Study design and participants
FOCUS was a pragmatic, parallel group, prospective, 
randomised, open trial with masked evaluation of 
outcomes, comparing CBT plus treatment as usual with 
treatment as usual alone in individuals unable to tolerate 
clozapine, or whose symptoms did not respond to the 
drug. We recruited participants through referrals from 
community-based and inpatient mental health services 
in five sites in the UK. The National Research Ethics 
Committee approved the FOCUS trial. Full details of the 
protocol are provided elsewhere.20
The inclusion criteria were: (1) persistent symptoms 
despite an adequate trial of clozapine in terms of dose, 
duration, and adherence,11 defined as treatment with 
clozapine at a stable dose of 400 mg or more (unless 
limited by tolerability) for at least 12 weeks, or if currently 
augmented with a second antipsychotic that had been 
given for at least 12 weeks, without remission of psychotic 
symptoms, or discontinuation of clozapine because of 
adverse reactions or inefficacy in the past 24 months; 
(2) presence of at least one psychotic symptom with a 
severity of 4 or more (for hallucinations or delusions) or 
5 or more (for suspiciousness or grandiosity) on the 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
For people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia who respond 
poorly to standard treatment with antipsychotic medication, 
the antipsychotic clozapine is generally considered to be the 
treatment of choice. However, 30–40% of people who trial 
clozapine can have a poor response to the medication and the 
range of adverse effects can prevent the optimal dose being 
reached or tolerated long term. We searched PubMed from 
inception to Feb 28, 2018, for publications in English, using 
the terms “clozapine resistant schizophrenia” and 
“treatment”. Our search yielded 24 publications, of which four 
were small randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of 
pharmacological or biological treatments for people with 
clozapine-resistant schizophrenia and four were systematic 
reviews and meta-analyses of pharmacological or biological 
augmentation strategies. No RCTs of psychological treatments 
for clozapine-resistant schizophrenia were found. Evidence for 
pharmacological and psychological treatments for people who 
meet criteria for clozapine-resistant schizophrenia is limited 
by small studies providing low-quality evidence.
Added value of this study
The reduction in psychiatric symptoms observed at the end of 
treatment with cognitive behavioural therapy is of a similar 
magnitude to that reported for pharmacological augmentation. 
However, there appear to be fewer side-effects associated with 
cognitive behavioural therapy, and the evidence for symptom 
reduction at end of treatment is of higher quality than that for 
pharmacological augmentation.
Implications of all the available evidence
There is insufficient evidence to support offering cognitive 
behavioural therapy to all patients with clozapine-resistant 
schizophrenia. A pragmatic individual trial might be indicated 
for some individuals, particularly when the person prefers 
talking therapy to pharmacological augmentation as their 
treatment choice.

Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), plus a 
PANSS total score of at least 58, which is equivalent to 
a clinical global impression of being at least mildly ill;21 
(3) in contact with mental health services and have a 
care coordinator; (4) meet either ICD-10 criteria for 
schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or delusional 
disorder, or criteria for an Early Intervention for Psychosis 
service to allow for diagnostic uncertainty in early phases; 
(5) aged 16 years or older; and (6) competent and willing 
to provide written, informed consent.
Our exclusion criteria were primary diagnosis of alcohol 
or substance dependence, developmental disability, non-
English speaking, and having received CBT within the 
past 12 months.
Potential participants were given an information sheet 
and, if willing to participate and provide written informed 
consent, they were offered an assessment.
Randomisation and masking
Randomisation was 1:1 by use of randomised-permuted 
blocks of random size (block sizes of four or six), 
stratified by centre and administered via a study-specific 
web-based portal. Allocation was notified to the trial 
manager, trial administrator, and trial therapists by email 
and to the participant by letter. Research assistants 
assessing outcomes were masked to allocation to protect 
against rater bias and allegiance bias. Masking was 
maintained with a wide range of measures, described in 
detail in our protocol.20 If a blind break occurred, where 
possible, a new research assistant masked to allocation 
was identified for subsequent follow-up assessments.
Procedures
CBT was delivered by appropriately qualified psychological 
therapists on an individual basis over a period of 9 months 
and included up to 26 h of treatment on an approximately 
weekly basis over the 9-month treatment window with up 
to four additional booster sessions in the following year. 
CBT was based on a specific cognitive model22 and 
used a manualised approach based on an individualised 
formulation:23 the chief investigator developed the model 
and manualised approach. CBT is a collaborative therapy 
that is problem orientated, working towards shared goals. 
Thus, treatment targets often included positive symptoms, 
but also included social issues (eg, improvement of 
relationships or development of meaningful roles) and 
emotional difficulties (eg, anxiety and depression). 
Fidelity to the treatment protocol was ensured by a 
combination of an initial week of training on the use of 
the specific model and manual, weekly supervision 
sessions, and quarterly training days, and was assessed by 
rating audio recordings of therapy sessions by use of 
the Cognitive Therapy Scale–Revised.24 Further details 
regarding establishing and monitoring adherence are 
provided elsewhere.20
The comparator was treatment as usual, which included 
care coordination from secondary care mental health 
services, including community mental health teams, 
early intervention in psychosis, or inpatient settings. All 
patients received follow-up from a multidisciplinary team 
within secondary mental health services. We did not ask 
services to withhold any treatment. All treatments in both 
conditions were monitored by use of an Economic Patient 
Questionnaire.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was total PANSS score at 21 months. 
The PANSS is a 30 item rating scale designed to provide a 
comprehensive assessment of psychiatric symptoms in 
adult patients with schizophrenia. Five components have 
been reported: positive, negative, depression-anxiety, 
agitation-excitement, and disorganisation.25 The PANSS 
was completed at baseline assessment, end of treatment 
(9 months), and 1-year follow-up (21 months). PANSS 
total score at 21 months was selected as the primary 
outcome because the durability of any treatment effect 
observed at the end of treatment was considered the most 
important criterion.
We collected secondary outcome measures at the 
timepoints mentioned earlier: the Psychotic Symptom 
Rating Scales (PSYRATS)26 to assess dimensions of 
auditory hallucinations and delusional beliefs; the 
Personal and Social Performance Scale to assess social 
functioning;27 the Calgary Depression Rating Scale for 
Schizophrenia to assess depression;28 and the Clinical 
Global Impression Scale (CGI)29 and a participant version 
(CGI-P) to obtain clinician and participant perception of 
global illness severity. Self-report questionnaires were 
used to assess self-rated recovery (the brief, 15 item 
Questionnaire about the Process of Recovery),30 health 
status and health-related utility (EQ-5D-5L),31 anxiety 
(meta-worry 
subscale 
of 
the 
Anxious 
Thoughts 
Inventory),32 alcohol use (Alcohol Use Disorder Test),33 
and drug use (Drug Abuse Screening Test).34 An economic 
evaluation was also done, which will be reported 
elsewhere. The measure of health benefit was the quality-
adjusted life-years derived from the health status and 
health-related utility questionnaire.
We recorded all events that met UK National Research 
Ethics Committee criteria for a serious adverse 
event 
—ie, serious negative events that are unexpected 
and deemed to be associated with the trial protocol 
or procedures. Additional unwanted effects of trial 
participation were defined as more than a 25% increase on 
PANSS total score or scoring 6+ on the CGI-Improvement 
Scale. We also developed a bespoke measure of potential 
unwanted effects of trial participation.
Statistical analysis
We calculated our sample to detect a difference in means 
between groups using a standardised effect size of 0·33 for 
90% power and two-sided α of 5%. We required outcome 
data on 194 participants per group, using our modelling 
approach to increase precision rather than potentially

reduce sample size. To account for 20% missing data, we 
inflated the sample size to 485. Statistical analysis was 
done after all participants completed 21 months of follow-
up. This analysis followed a prespecified plan. Continuous 
variables were summarised using mean (SD) or median 
(IQR), and discrete variables were reported as absolute 
number and percentage. The primary outcome was 
analysed with repeated measures from linear mixed 
models that adjusted for prespecified baseline covariates 
(baseline PANSS, sex, and age) and included a random 
effect for site. Treatment effects are presented with 
95% CIs for each timepoint. Additionally, the results of the 
primary analysis are expressed in the standardised mean 
difference scale to assist in the interpretation of our results 
compared with our hypothesised effect. The primary 
analysis was by randomised treatment based on intention 
to treat for all patients for whom data were available. To 
estimate treatment efficacy, we estimated complier average 
casual effects using instrumental variable methods. 
Secondary outcomes were analysed with linear mixed 
models, and adverse events were analysed with a χ² test or 
logistic regression. We made no adjustments to secondary 
outcome CIs for multiple testing. Use of these linear 
mixed models allowed for the analysis of all available data, 
on the assumption that data were missing at random,35 
conditional on covariates. Sensitivity analysis by use of 
multiple imputation on the primary outcome was done as 
well as the removal of participants who discontinued 
clozapine because of side-effects. We used estimated 
treatment effects adjusted for non-attendance at CBT with 
Complier Average Causal Effect models using two-stage 
least squares. We report the primary outcome showing 
improvement from baseline using 20%, 25%, 50%, and 
75% thresholds, and the corresponding number needed to 
treat to aid interpretation. Additionally, we report the 
PANSS outcomes by severity based on inclusion criteria 
(delusions or hallucinatory behaviour with a score of 4 or 
greater and grandiosity or suspiciousness persecution with 
a score of 5 or greater). All analyses used Stata version 14·0. 
The Independent Data Monitoring Committee monitored 
accumulating unblinded data throughout the trial.

Results
We identified 898 potentially eligible participants, of 
whom 565 (63%) met criteria for further assessment 
between Jan 1, 2013, and May 31, 2015. We randomly 
assigned 487 (86%) of 565 participants who met inclusion 
criteria and agreed to take part in either CBT plus 
treatment as usual (n=242) or treatment as usual 
alone (n=245; figure). Participants recruited via Early 
Intervention in Psychosis services (n=8) all met criteria 
for an ICD-10 schizophrenia spectrum diagnosis. Details 
of ineligibility are shown in the appendix. Analysis 
included 209 in the CBT group and 216 in the treatment 
as usual group. Baseline clinical and demographic data 
are shown in table 1; the groups were balanced across 
characteristics. Participants assigned to CBT plus 
treatment as usual received a median of 21 CBT sessions 
(IQR 12–25) within the 9-month treatment window; 
213 (88%) of 242 attended six or more sessions, with only 
12 (5%) participants attending no sessions (appendix).

At 9 months, 51 blind breaks had occurred (23 of these 
patients were transferred to a new assessor, so 
28 remained unblinded). By 21 months, there were 
55 blind breaks (35 patients were transferred to a new 
assessor, so 20 remained unblinded). PANSS outcome at 
baseline by severity based on inclusion criteria showed 
no difference between the groups (appendix).
Mean PANSS scores improved in both randomised 
groups over time from a mean of 83 at baseline (table 2). At 
21 months, no difference occurred between the groups on 
PANSS total score (–0·89, 95% CI –3·32 to 1·55; p=0·48), 
although at 9 months, a small difference occurred 
between the groups in favour of CBT on PANSS total 
(–2·40, –4·79 to –0·02; p=0·049). This difference is 
equivalent to an effect size of –0·16 (95% CI –0·32 to 
–0·001) at 9 months and –0·06 (95% CI –0·21 to 0·10) at 
21 months using the standardised mean difference scale. 
Multiple imputation sensitivity analysis gave similar 
results 
(appendix). 
Removal 
of 
participants 
who 
discontinued clozapine because of side-effects at baseline 
overall gave similar results (appendix). The adjustment for 
receiving at least six sessions of CBT had little effect on 
treatment effect estimates due to high compliance 
proportions: at 9 months, the Complier Average Causal 
Effect estimate was –2·50 (95% CI –5·10 to 0·11; p=0·060) 
and –0·87 (–3·69 to 1·96; p=0·55) at 21 months (appendix). 
We also estimated that the effect of each extra treatment 
session resulted in a change in PANSS total score of 
–0·12 (95% CI –0·24 to 0·00, p=0·059). Treatment effect 
estimates followed a similar pattern for other PANSS 
outcomes (tables 2 and 3). At 21 months, 28 (13%) of 
209 participants in the CBT plus treatment as usual group 
and 14 (7%) of 216 in the treatment as usual alone group 
had more than 50% improvement in PANSS (number 
needed to treat 15, 95% CI 8 [number needed to treat, 
benefit] to 81 [number needed to treat, benefit]).
The difference between groups on health-related quality 
of life was 0·028 (95% CI –0·012 to 0·068; p=0·17) at 
21 months, and for the Questionnaire about the Process of 
Recovery, the difference was 2·03 (0·04 to 4·01; p=0·045).

Effect estimates for the complete set of secondary 
outcomes from the linear mixed models are provided in 
table 4. The direction of effect favours CBT for all 
outcomes, but with considerable uncertainty for all but a 
few outcomes at the end of treatment (positive symptoms, 
emotional distress, excitement, and voices) and at follow-
up (self-rated recovery, emotional distress related to 
delusions, and CGI improvement).
Few serious adverse events occurred and few were 
attributable to trial participation (table 5). The total 
number of adverse events was higher in the group 
receiving CBT than in the treatment as usual alone 
group, but this was driven by one participant who had 
22 self-harm events. Slightly more participants in the 
CBT group had an adverse event (107 [44%] of 242 vs 
104 [42%] of 245, odds ratio 1·09 (95% CI 0·81–1·46; 
p=0·58). Fewer suicidal crises and symptom exacerbation 
or outcome deterioration threshold events occurred in 
the CBT group than in the treatment as usual group, and 
no differences in reports of potential unwanted effects of 
trial participation occurred (appendix). Participants 
receiving CBT had weekly contact with trial staff tasked 
with reporting adverse effects (the trial therapists), 
whereas participants receiving treatment as usual alone 
had less frequent contact with trial staff (the trial research 
assistants) resulting in a maximum of 37 opportunities 
for such events to be detected in patients receiving CBT 
and treatment as usual versus seven opportunities for 
the group receiving treatment as usual alone. This might 
result in surveillance bias, favouring treatment as usual.
Discussion
In our study assessing whether CBT is an effective 
treatment for clozapine-resistant schizophrenia, we found 
no effect of CBT on our primary outcome (21-month 
PANSS total), although there was a small effect on PANSS 
total by the end of treatment. The number needed to treat 
for a good outcome at 21 months, defined using the 
commonly accepted more than 50% PANSS improvement 
threshold,36 was 15, which suggests that CBT can produce 
worthwhile, lasting outcomes for a proportion of people 
with clozapine-resistant schizophrenia. However, the 
threshold for improvement recommended for use with 
treatment-resistant schizophrenia by an international 
working group in their consensus guidelines is 20%;37 the 
analysis of good outcomes at 21 months using this 
threshold suggests that little difference exists between 
CBT and treatment as usual. The high retention and 
adherence to treatment clearly show that CBT was highly 
acceptable to participants. Several other small effects on 
secondary outcomes that are considered to be important 
occurred at the end of treatment (PANSS positive 
symptoms, PANSS emotional distress, PANSS excitement, 
and PSYRATS hallucinations) and at follow-up (self-rated 
recovery, emotional distress related to delusions, and CGI 
improvement), although these average effects are unlikely 
to be clinically significant. The change observed at 
21 months on the measure of recovery is encouraging 
given the debate about the most meaningful outcomes 
(clinicians tend to prioritise symptom change, whereas 
service users tend to prioritise improvements in recovery,

functioning, and emotion). The absence of association 
between psychiatric symptoms and recovery is consistent 
with research showing the indirect effects of symptoms on 
recovery. There was no suggestion that the addition of 
CBT to treatment as usual caused more adverse effects. 
Fewer suicidal crises, symptom exacerbations, and 
deteriorations occurred in those allocated to CBT. This 
finding is noteworthy given the increased surveillance 
and opportunity for these events to be observed in the 
CBT arm.
Although the benefit of CBT was significant at the end 
of the treatment (9 months), CBT had no lasting effect 
on total psychiatric symptoms in clozapine-resistant 
schizophrenia (at 21 months). This is similar to the 
observed effects of medications for people with psychosis, 
which also diminish when treatment ends.38 The 
observed average reductions in PANSS total score were 
lower than the 15 points estimated to be equivalent to a 
rating of minimal improvement on the CGI scale.39 The 
effects on PANSS positive symptoms, PANSS emotional 
distress, and auditory hallucinations (PSYRATS total) by 
the end of the treatment show that CBT can change 
psychotic symptoms, as well as negative emotions, in a 
large, well conducted, assessor-blind clinical trial. This 
finding suggests that claims that such effects cannot be 
replicated under these conditions17 are unfounded. The 
effect sizes observed in the FOCUS trial are similar to 
those found across all heterogeneous but rigorous CBT 
trials when meta-analysed.17 The effect sizes are also 
similar to those found for pharmacological augmentation 
of clozapine with a second antipsychotic. However, our 
trial provides stronger evidence, with less risk of bias 
than the few, small, short-duration, high risk of bias trials 
in meta-analyses of augmentation with antipsychotics. 
The adverse effect profile for CBT is also likely to be 
favourable when compared with the cardiovascular risks 
associated with multiple antipsychotic medications.40 
Some small lasting effects were observed at 21 months, 
including on self-rated recovery, which is important to 
service users; however, these effects are unlikely to reach 
a threshold of clinically important change.
Despite our trial being methodologically rigorous, 
several limitations exist. The comparator was treatment 
as usual, which meant that concealment of allocation 
from participants was not possible. Additionally, the 
lack of an active comparator means we are unable to 
control for non-specific effects such as contact time and 
a therapeutic relationship. We did not correct for 
multiple comparisons; therefore, multiple hypothesis 
testing could have led to type one error. The 26 h of 
therapy might have been an insufficient length for 
patients with clozapine-resistant schizophrenia, who 
have problems with memory, negative symptoms, and 
side-effects of polypharmacy, which would be consistent 
with other trials of CBT for similar populations.41

diagnoses other than schizophrenia (eg, delusional 
disorder), which might have reduced the homogeneity 
of the sample. Arguably, participants who were unable 
to tolerate clozapine due to side-effects could meet 
criteria for treatment-resistant schizophrenia rather 
than 
clozapine-resistant 
schizophrenia; 
however, 
alternatives to clozapine are still required for such a 
population, and the sensitivity analysis excluding those 
who discontinued clozapine found a similar pattern of 
results. Similarly, we did not routinely assess clozapine 
blood levels, nor did we assess response to placebo 
before 
randomisation 
therefore, 
some 
of 
our 
participants might not have been truly clozapine 
resistant. The mean baseline PANSS total score of 
83 suggests that, on average, our participants were 
moderately ill; however, our entry criteria were also 
modified to include those who were at least mildly ill 
(ie, at least 58), whereas Honer’s trial11 had a minimum 
of 80 for inclusion. Although attempts were made to 
minimise the likelihood of allegiance bias (eg, masking 
of assessors), this possibility remains.
Some might argue that, since positive symptoms are 
the target of clozapine, and are often considered the 
primary target of CBT for psychosis, they would have 
been a more appropriate primary outcome for this trial. 
We chose severity of total symptoms of schizophrenia 
because the FOCUS trial was a pragmatic effectiveness 
trial. A similar pattern was seen with PANSS positive 
symptoms and PSYRATS hallucinations showing 
significant effects at the end of treatment but not at 
follow-up. Therefore, a similar overall conclusion is likely 
to have been reached if the trial had chosen to use a 
specific measure of positive symptoms as the primary 
outcome. The choice regarding the timing of the primary 
outcome is more likely to have influenced the overall 
conclusion. If end of treatment had been selected, the 
conclusion would probably have been that CBT is of 
benefit to people with clozapine-resistant psychosis, but 
the effect does not persist.
Our results do not support a recommendation to 
routinely offer CBT for clozapine-resistant schizo- 
phrenia. Offering it as a pragmatic individual trial might 
be worthwhile, particularly in cases where distressing 
positive symptoms exist or where service users are 
reluctant to consider pharmacological augmentation 
because of probable side-effect burden. CBT should 
probably be offered earlier in the course of psychosis, 
since individuals with a long history of mental health 
problems and a lack of response to pharmacological 
interventions might also be less likely to benefit from 
psychological interventions than those with psychoses 
who are more responsive to antipsychotic medications.
Given that more people with clozapine-resistant 
schizophrenia showed a good clinical outcome to CBT 
with treatment as usual than those to treatment as usual 
alone, it is important to be able to identify factors that 
might predict who is going to benefit. Identification of 
responders to CBT might be possible by use of trajectory 
analysis, risk modelling, or methods such as cluster 
analysis. Future research should examine how intensive 
psychological treatment needs to be after 9 months to 
maintain the effects observed at the end of treatment. 
Further consideration should also be given to the most

appropriate and valued outcomes for this population. 
For individuals who do not respond to clozapine or CBT, 
attempting to increase wellbeing, subjective recovery, 
and social functioning might be more successful than 
attempting to reduce symptoms, and might be more 
important to service users and their families.
In conclusion, there was no lasting effect of CBT 
for clozapine-resistant schizophrenia on our primary 
outcome of psychiatric symptoms at 21 months. However, 
CBT was highly acceptable, produced small but significant 
improvements in psychiatric symptoms at the end of 
treatment (9 months) and a lasting improvement on self-
rated recovery (21 months), with little evidence of adverse 
effects. Entrenched symptoms might need a longer 
period of continuing psychological intervention, similar 
to the use of medication.
