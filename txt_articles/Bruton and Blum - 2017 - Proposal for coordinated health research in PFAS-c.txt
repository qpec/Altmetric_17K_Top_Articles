Proposal for coordinated health research in
PFAS-contaminated communities in the
United States
Thomas A. Bruton1* and Arlene Blum1,2
Abstract
The drinking water of more than six million Americans in numerous communities has been found to contain highly
fluorinated chemicals at concentrations of concern. Certain of these chemicals, including perfluorooctanoic acid
and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid, are known to be persistent, bioaccumulative, and associated with adverse health
outcomes in humans and animal models. The possible health impacts of exposure to highly fluorinated chemicals
are of great concern to communities whose water has been impacted. Community members want information,
and are asking for biomonitoring, exposure pathway analysis, and health studies. Governmental agencies are
striving to deal with these multiple concerns in the face of information and resource constraints. We propose the
development of a high-level research strategy to maximize what can be learned about health effects of highly
fluorinated chemicals and methods to reduce or eliminate exposure. We suggest coordinating the research across
multiple communities for greater statistical power. If implemented, such a strategy could help to generate
information and evidence integration to enable regulatory decision making and contribute to reducing
future exposures.

Background
We write as scientists, public health officials, and physi-
cians (see Appendix 1 for full list of signatories) to
propose a coordinated plan of action for the study of
U.S. communities whose drinking water is contaminated
with highly fluorinated chemicals (per- and polyfluor-
oalkyl substances, PFAS; sometimes known as PFCs).
This highly persistent and potentially toxic class of che-
micals, including perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), per-
fluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), and many related
substances, have been released into the environment
worldwide, resulting in widespread contamination of
drinking water supplies. For example, more than six mil-
lion Americans in numerous communities have been ex-
posed to these chemicals at concentrations of concern.
A research agenda that is coordinated across the many
impacted communities in the U.S. is needed to maximize
what can be learned from these unfortunate exposures.
First, the impacted communities urgently need clean
drinking water. As they receive it, the levels of PFAS con-
taminants in people’s bodies should decrease. Second, we
need to learn from the current unfortunate situation to
understand the implications of these exposures and their
potential link to health impacts. A coordinated program
of exposure analysis, biomonitoring, health studies, and
medical monitoring should help regulators set appropriate
health advisory levels and contribute to preventing similar
future contamination, both in the U.S. and internationally.
Extent of contamination
The extent of PFAS contamination became known after
PFOA, PFOS, and others were detected at relatively high
concentrations in public drinking water systems around
the country through a survey led by the U.S. Environ-
mental Protection Agency (EPA) between 2013 and 2015
[1]. In May 2016, after more than a decade of study on
exposure and effects of PFAS, EPA issued a lifetime
health advisory level of 70 parts per trillion for the sum
of PFOS and PFOA, the two PFASs detected at the

 highest levels in humans and the environment [2]. The
drinking water of millions of Americans was found to
contain these chemicals at concentrations above this
safety level [1]. Major sources include production, use,
and disposal of PFAS at manufacturing sites, as well as
military fire training areas, civilian airports, and waste-
water treatment plants. Sixty-three communities whose
water had been tested and found to contain high levels
were informed by the EPA of the potential for harm [3].
Biomonitoring has shown that people living in areas
with contaminated drinking water are more likely to
have elevated concentrations in their blood [4–7].
Potential for harm
The possible adverse health impacts are of great concern
to members of affected communities. In human observa-
tional (epidemiological) studies, PFOA and/or PFOS
have been associated with kidney and testicular cancer,
decreased birth weight, thyroid disease, decreased sperm
quality, high cholesterol, pregnancy-induced hyperten-
sion, asthma, ulcerative colitis, and decreased response
to vaccination [5]. In animal studies, one or both of
these chemicals cause liver toxicity, thyroid toxicity, tes-
ticular, pancreatic, thyroid, and liver tumors, obesity, im-
mune suppression, and reproductive and developmental
toxicity including altered mammary gland development,
reduced ossification, accelerated puberty, resorption of
developing fetus, and mortality and delayed development
of offspring [5]. Exposure to these chemicals is especially
harmful during critical windows of fetal development.
PFOA, PFOS, and other long-chain (from 6 to 12 fluori-
nated carbon atoms) PFAS are of particular concern be-
cause they remain in the body for many years after
exposure ends [8]. Production of long-chain PFAS has
been phased out in the United States, Western Europe,
and Japan, and the use of these legacy chemicals is being
replaced by short-chain perfluoroalkyl acids (3–5 fluori-
nated carbon atoms) and other subclasses of PFAS, such
as perfluoroalkyl ether carboxylic acids and sulfonic
acids. These replacement compounds have been de-
tected in soil and groundwater at high levels and in
drinking water supplies [1], but have not been studied
for their health effects in humans.
Current situation
State health departments and the federal Agency for
Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), with
limited information and resources, are striving to deal
with multiple concerns arising from the contamination
of the environment, humans, livestock, and wildlife. Af-
fected communities want clean drinking water, and in-
formation about their exposures and potential long-term
health effects. Community members, who have been
using contaminated water for drinking, food preparation,
showering, washing, and watering gardens, sometimes
for decades, want to know their blood-levels, what those
measurements mean for their family (especially their
children), and how to reduce them. Communities are
asking for biomonitoring, exposure pathway analysis,
and health studies. At present, studies are being initiated
in a few locations to address the needs of the commu-
nity or interests of the researcher. However, the scope
and objectives of these studies vary. Coordination be-
tween the many different community efforts, academic
studies, and public health investigations is needed to ad-
dress the interests and needs of all stakeholders.
A coordinated research agenda for health studies
in PFAS-contaminated communities in the U.S.
Much of the power of epidemiology studies and expos-
ure science depends on the number of participants: the
larger the number of participants, the greater the poten-
tial for useful results. The availability and timing of both
exposure and health outcome measurements are key fac-
tors that affect the utility of data. If biomonitoring, ex-
posure analysis, health recording, and epidemiological
research were to be coordinated across multiple im-
pacted communities, a wealth of useful information on
health effects and methods to reduce or eliminate expos-
ure from PFAS could be obtained. Questions include:
� Which legacy and current-use PFAS have communities
been exposed to, and what were the levels and
durations of these exposures?
� What health effects may be associated with these
exposures?
� What levels of exposure might trigger such health
effects?
� Which life stages are most sensitive to the effects of
PFAS exposure?
� What is the relationship between the concentrations
in drinking water and in humans?
� How does the drinking water exposure route
compare to other routes such as ingestion of food or
dust and dermal absorption in terms of magnitude
and potential health effects?
� What are the rates at which the chemicals are
cleared from the human body?
� What, if anything, can be done to mitigate exposure
and the probability of adverse health effects,
especially in children?
Precedent: C8 study and what was learned
One model for coordinated studies of large populations
exposed to PFAS is the C8 Science Panel. Beginning in
2006, nearly 70,000 community members in the Ohio
River Valley whose drinking water had been contami-
nated by PFOA for decades were studied retrospectively
Bruton and Blum Environmental Health  (2017) 16:120

 by the C8 Panel [7]. This independent panel of three
leading epidemiologists collaborated with local medical
professionals and many other researchers to design a
series of complementary studies to assess the probable
links between PFOA and disease. Their results, which
found probable links between PFOA exposure and six
human diseases, as well as associations with several
other health endpoints, substantially contributed to what
is known about the health effects of this chemical [9].
As an adjunct to the above, a complementary approach
would be to bring together common data from existing
studies as does the NIH ECHO program for children’s
health.
We propose the following:
� Invite experts in fields including epidemiology,
medical ethics, biostatistics, immunology, toxicology,
exposure science, cancer, and endocrinology to
develop a high-level coordinated research strategy.
This strategy would address the needs of affected
communities for education, biomonitoring, health
studies, and medical monitoring, and would establish
clear protocols for disclosure of research findings.
This plan for community-based studies would build
on the C8 study methodology as well as other
current research protocols. This research could also
include data from other ongoing studies of the
health effects of chemical exposures using large
longitudinal cohorts.
� Develop the above research agenda with active
participation from members of affected communities.
� Estimate cost of biomonitoring and health studies
following the approach developed above.
� Communicate the approach outlined above to
communities and decision makers including local
and state health departments, federal agencies such
as ATSDR and NIEHS, the military, members of
Congress and other stakeholders, especially those
from impacted areas, and seek public comment
and input.
� Work with the federal government agencies already
involved in PFAS research to initiate these coordinated
studies.
� A likely mechanism for development of such a high-
level research strategy was included in proposed
amendments to the 2018 U.S. Defense authorization
bill. The intent of these amendments was to authorize
a five-year national study of PFOA and PFOS
exposures resulting from military use of PFAS-
containing firefighting foam. While the passage of
these amendments is a step in the right direction,
this study, as described, is likely insufficient. If
and when the study is carried out, its scope should be
expanded to include a wider range of PFASs than
PFOA and PFOS. Such a study could also be improved
by including all federal agencies with relevant expertise,
including the NIEHS.
Conclusions
PFAS and other environmental contaminants impact
nearly all of us. Indeed, highly fluorinated chemicals
have been detected in the blood of more than 95% of
Americans [10]. Communities worldwide are facing con-
tamination problems similar to those in the U.S. The
current widespread contamination of drinking water
provides an opportunity to better understand many
types of PFAS chemicals, and their human health effects.
We as scientists and public health professionals sup-
port the development of a coordinated research strategy
to learn as much as possible from the unfortunate ex-
posure of millions of Americans to PFASs in their drink-
ing water. Action is needed now to generate the
information and evidence integration to enable regula-
tory decision making. This coordinated research strategy
would also contribute to reducing exposure to PFASs
from drinking water and other sources.
