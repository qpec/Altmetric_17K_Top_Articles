Abstract
 Objective—The central public health challenge for winter seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is 
recurrence prevention. Preliminary studies suggest better long-term outcomes following cognitive-
behavioral therapy (CBT-SAD) than light therapy. This study is a large randomized head-to-head 
comparison of these treatments on outcomes one and two winters after acute treatment.
 Method—Community adults with Major Depression, Recurrent with Seasonal Pattern (N=177) 
were followed one and two winters after a randomized trial of 6-weeks of CBT-SAD (n=88) or 
light therapy (n=89). Prospective followup visits occurred in January or February of each year, and 
major depression status was assessed by phone in October and December of the first year. The 
primary outcome was winter depression recurrence status on the Structured Interview Guide for 
the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression-SAD Version (SIGH-SAD). Other outcomes were 
depression severity on the SIGH-SAD and the Beck Depression Inventory-Second Edition (BDI-
II), remission status based on severity cutpoints, and major depression status from tracking calls.
 Results—The treatments did not differ on any outcome during the first year of followup. The 
second winter, CBT-SAD was associated with a smaller proportion of SIGH-SAD recurrences 
(27.3% vs. 45.6%), less severe symptoms on both measures, and a larger proportion of remissions

 defined as BDI-II≤8 (63.3% vs. 43.9%) than light therapy. Non-recurrence at next winter was 
more highly associated with non-recurrence the second winter among CBT-SAD (RR=5.12) than 
light therapy (RR=1.92) subjects.
 Conclusions—CBT-SAD was superior to light therapy two winters following acute treatment, 
suggesting greater durability for CBT-SAD.
The central public health challenge in the management of winter seasonal affective disorder 
(SAD) (1) is prevention of depressive episode recurrence over subsequent winters. Light 
therapy, the most studied treatment, is highly efficacious for acute SAD (2). However, long-
term compliance with clinical practice guidelines recommending daily light therapy during 
the symptomatic months each year is poor. Most patients fail to re-initiate light therapy in 
subsequent winters (3), leaving them vulnerable to recurrence without other treatment. 
Cognitive-behavioral therapy tailored for SAD (CBT-SAD) (4) is an emerging, time-limited, 
alternative treatment. Whereas light therapy targets a chronobiological vulnerability, CBT-
SAD targets a psychological vulnerability, specifically maladaptive thoughts through 
cognitive restructuring and avoidance behaviors through behavioral activation, to alleviate 
current symptoms and prevent future recurrences. Attenuated risk for relapse and recurrence 
of nonseasonal major depression following cognitive therapy is well-documented (5). If 
CBT-SAD's effects endure after treatment to prevent recurrences, it may offer a more 
practical method of managing long-term SAD symptoms than re-initiating daily light 
therapy each year.
Pilot studies found that CBT-SAD and light therapy showed comparable improvements 
during treatment (6), but that CBT-SAD was associated with fewer recurrences and less 
severe symptoms at naturalistic followup the next winter (7). The first wave of our new, 
largest randomized trial found large and comparable improvements in CBT-SAD and light 
therapy over the acute treatment phase (8). At treatment endpoint, the treatments did not 
differ on patient- or rater-assessed depression severity or the proportion of patients in 
remission (47.6% in CBT-SAD vs. 47.2% in light therapy). This study focuses on the 
primary aim of that project: to compare the long-term efficacy of CBT-SAD vs. light therapy 
one and two winters following treatment. We hypothesized that CBT-SAD would be 
associated with a smaller proportion of depression recurrences, less severe symptoms, and a 
larger proportion of remissions than light therapy over followup.
 Methods
 Design Overview
This trial was conducted at the Mood and Seasonality Laboratory at the University of 
Vermont and was approved by the University's institutional review board. The enrolled 
sample of patients (N = 177) was randomized to 6 weeks of CBT-SAD or light therapy and 
prospectively tracked through two new winters following treatment endpoint. Prior 
publications detail our full protocol (9) and report baseline characteristics, treatment 
integrity, and acute treatment outcomes (8). Participants were aged 18 or older and met 
DSM-IV-TR criteria for Major Depression, Recurrent, with Seasonal Pattern on the 
Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders (SCID) and a current SAD

 episode on the Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression–
Seasonal Affective Disorder Version (same criteria as for recurrence, below). Exclusion 
criteria were kept to a minimum to maximize external validity. Potential participants were 
screened out for current light therapy or psychotherapy for depression, prior light therapy or 
CBT for SAD, a comorbid Axis I disorder primary to SAD requiring immediate treatment, 
acute and serious suicidal intent, initiation of a new antidepressant medication in the past 
month or plans to change the dose of a current antidepressant, or positive laboratory findings 
for hypothyroidism at medical workup.
 Power
The study was powered to detect clinically meaningful differences between treatments on 
SAD recurrences (primary outcome) following treatment of the index episode. With these 
sample sizes (88 CBT-SAD, 89 light therapy), there was 80% power to detect differences 
between treatments of .21 in recurrence proportions and ≥ 3.6 points in SIGH-SAD scores at 
followup.
 Treatments
 Light Therapy—We used the 23 × 15 ½ × 3 ¼ in. SunRay® (SunBox Company, 
Gaithersburg, MD), which emits 10,000-lux of cool-white fluorescent light through a UV 
filter, initiated at 30 minutes immediately upon awakening. Weekly clinical adjustments 
were made per a treatment algorithm, in consultation with our study psychiatrist and light 
therapy expert (TTP), to maximize treatment response and reduce side effects. Final doses of 
light therapy were reported in Rohan et al. (8). Participants were advised to continue with 
daily light therapy until their typical time of spontaneous remission, then to return the light 
boxes in May.
 Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy for SAD (CBT-SAD)—CBT-SAD (4) uses 
psychoeducation, behavioral activation, and cognitive restructuring to specifically target 
winter depression. The format is 90-minute closed-group therapy sessions twice per week 
for 6 weeks (12 sessions). Each group was facilitated by the Principal Investigator (KJR) or 
one of two community Ph.D.-level psychologists. Session attendance descriptive statistics 
and analyses for therapist and group membership effects (all ns) were reported in Rohan et 
al. (8).
 Standardized Instructions for Continued Study Treatment the Next Winter
The first week of September, letters were mailed to participants treated the winter before 
prompting resumption of study treatment. For light therapy-treated participants, the letter 
encouraged re-initiating daily light therapy upon onset of first depressive symptom and 
provided two options: borrowing a study light box for the duration of winter or purchasing a 
unit. The letter provided contact information for manufactures with a list of specifications to 
match our devices (i.e., full-sized units emitting 10,000-lux cool-white light through UV 
filter). For CBT-SAD-treated participants, the letter encouraged use of the skills learned in 
CBT-SAD on their own (without a therapist). Both letters stated that if the recommended 
strategy proved insufficient, participants should pursue formal treatment and provided 
contact information for local mental health centers and treatment providers. These letters

 were intended to promote fidelity with study treatment over followup, while addressing 
ethical concerns about proscribing additional treatment, if needed.
 Outcome Measures
The 29-item Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression—
Seasonal Affective Disorder Version SIGH-SAD (10) includes the 21-item Hamilton Rating 
Scale for Depression (HAM-D) and the 8-item atypical symptoms subscale. The primary 
outcome was SIGH-SAD recurrence status as assessed at next and second winter followup, 
indicated by total SIGH-SAD ≥ 20, HAM-D ≥ 10, and atypical score ≥ 5. Other SIGH-SAD-
derived outcomes at next and second winter followup included continuous depression scores 
(total as well as HAM-D and atypical) and remission status. Remission status was classified 
as either: ≥ 50% improvement in SIGH-SAD score from pretreatment to followup + 
followup HAM-D score ≤ 7 + followup atypical score ≤ 7 OR followup HAM-D score ≤ 2 + 
followup atypical score ≤ 10. A second blind rater rated audio-recordings of the SIGH-
SADs. Intra-class correlations for inter-rater reliability were 0.965 at next winter and 0.967 
at second winter.
The Beck Depression Inventory—Second Edition (BDI-II) (11), a 21-item self-report 
measure of depressive symptom severity, was also administered at next winter and second 
winter. BDI-II outcomes at followup included total scores and a cutoff score of ≤ 8 as a 
secondary marker of remission, consistent with our prior trials.
 Followup Assessment Procedures
 Phone Tracking of Recurrences and Retreatment—Participants were contacted 
twice by phone (in October and December) in the interim between treatment completion and 
the in-person next winter followup to track recurrences and new treatments initiated. These 
tracking procedures were implemented starting with the second enrolled cohort (n = 153; 76 
CBT-SAD, 77 light therapy). These calls were conducted by a trained, blinded clinical 
psychology graduate student and involved: (2) assessing DSM-IV-TR criteria for a major 
depressive episode on the SCID since date of last contact (i.e., formal assessment or last 
tracking call), and (3) documenting any treatments initiated since last contact using scripted 
questions about light therapy, psychotherapy, and medications.
 In-Person Next Winter and Second Winter Followup Visits—In-person visits 
were conducted in January or February of the next winter and the second winter. Consistent 
with the intent-to-treat principle, all randomized participants were invited to attend 
followups. A trained clinical psychology graduate student, blind to treatment assignment, 
administered the SIGH-SAD interview; the BDI-II; and a questionnaire assessing use of 
light therapy, psychotherapy, and medications since initial study treatment (at next winter) 
and since the next winter followup (at second winter).
 Statistical Analyses
The primary analysis was an intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis based on multiple imputation 
(MI) of missing next winter SIGH-SAD scores, which were then used to classify depression 
recurrence status for individuals who dropped out during the treatment phase, withdrew from

 protocol, or were subsequently lost to followup. The fully conditional specification (fcs) 
regression method was used to obtain imputed values based on age, sex, baseline comorbid 
diagnosis status, and depression scores at other timepoints. Separate regressions were used 
to impute values for the CBT-SAD and light therapy conditions because of differing effects 
of the predictors in the two treatments. Imputed values included a random component 
reflecting the residual distribution for the dependent variable and ten data sets with differing 
imputed values were generated. The difference between the CBT-SAD and light therapy 
groups in the proportions of subjects with a recurrence and in remission the next winter was 
estimated for each of the ten imputed data sets and the estimates were combined using the 
inference methods for MI described by Little and Rubin (12). SAS PROC MI and PROC 
MIANALYZE were used to carry out the imputation and analysis. Sensitivity analysis was 
conducted to examine robustness of the results under alternative imputation methods, 
including using the best- and worst-case scenarios for each treatment, and using a logistic 
regression in the MI analysis to directly impute recurrence (rather than linear regression to 
impute SIGH-SAD scores). The BDI-II outcomes were analyzed in the same manner, as 
were outcomes for the second winter followup. Analyses based on available data, without 
imputation, were also performed using logistic and linear regression analyses for 
dichotomous and continuous outcomes, respectively. In addition to prospectively assessed 
SIGH-SAD recurrence status, analyses using available data were performed for fulfilling 
DSM-IV-TR major depression criteria for the interims assessed by the October and 
December tracking telephone calls. For dichotomous outcomes that differed by treatment at 
next and second winter followup, logistic regressions were performed to assess the effect of 
treatment group after adjustment for ongoing treatment(s) reported at that time point using 
data without imputation. We considered any treatment(s), in general, and any new treatment, 
psychotherapy, light therapy, and antidepressant medications, specifically. When coded for 
analysis, light therapy-treated patients reporting light therapy were counted as light therapy 
but not as any new treatment, and psychotherapy with a therapist among CBT-SAD patients 
was considered as both psychotherapy and any new treatment. For continuous outcomes that 
differed by treatment, linear regressions were used to assess the effect of treatment on 
depression scores after adjustment for any, new, and each ongoing treatment.
 Results
Figure 1 displays the CONSORT flow diagram from the point of randomization through the 
fall tracking phone calls and the next and second winter followups. See Rohan et al. (8) for 
prior stages of participant flow, including screening. Missing data was minimal. At the in-
person followups, 170/177 (96%) provided data the next winter and 169/177 (95%) provided 
data the second winter. Of those enrolled after the initial year, 144/153 (94%) and 132/153 
(86%) completed the October December tracking calls, respectively.
 Primary and Secondary Outcomes
Comparisons between the treatments on next and second winter outcomes are shown in 
Tables 1 and 2, separately for the multiple imputation analyses using the intent-to-treat 
sample and the secondary analyses using all available data. Table 1 displays the 
dichotomous outcomes of recurrence and remission, and Table 2 presents the continuous

 outcomes of SIGH-SAD and BDI-II scores. Figure 2 graphically displays the main findings. 
There were no statistically significant differences between CBT-SAD and light therapy on 
any of the outcomes at the next winter followup. There was also no significant difference 
between treatments in recurrence status based on the October and December tracking calls: 
9/73 (12.3%) CBT-SAD participants and 16/76 (21.1%) light therapy participants with 
tracking call data met major depression criteria, p = .154.
At the second winter followup, CBT-SAD was statistically superior to light therapy on 2 out 
of 3 dichotomous outcomes and on 3 out of 4 continuous outcomes, and this pattern was 
consistent across analyses using multiple imputation and all available data. On the primary 
outcome (SIGH-SAD recurrences), CBT-SAD was associated with fewer recurrences at the 
second winter than light therapy (27.3% vs. 45.6% using imputation; 28.0% vs. 46.5% 
without imputation). CBT-SAD was also associated with more remissions at second winter 
than light therapy using BDI-II criteria (68.3% vs. 44.5% using imputation; 62.7% vs. 
44.2% without imputation), but not using SIGH-SAD criteria. Depression scores in CBT-
SAD were significantly lower than in light therapy at second winter on both the SIGH-SAD 
and the BDI-II. Considering the component scales of the SIGH-SAD separately, HAM-D 
scores were lower in CBT-SAD than in light therapy at second winter, but the treatments did 
not differ on atypical subscale scores.
Given that the treatments did not differ at next winter, but differed on the majority of 
outcomes at second winter, we conducted exploratory analyses to probe this. Using SIGH-
SAD recurrence status, we examined the association between recurrence status at next 
winter and the risk of recurrence at second winter within each treatment group. CBT-SAD 
subjects without recurrence at next winter were about five times more likely to not have 
recurrence the second winter relative to CBT-SAD subjects with recurrence at next winter 
(87.5% vs. 15.5%, RR = 5.12). In contrast, light therapy subjects without recurrence at next 
winter were only about twice as likely to not have recurrence the second winter relative to 
light therapy subjects with recurrence at next winter (63.5% vs. 30.0%, RR = 1.92). The 
ratio of RR (2.67) differed significantly from one (z = 2.38, p = .017), indicating that 
although next winter recurrence status was predictive of second winter recurrence in both 
treatments, the relationship was stronger in CBT-SAD than in light therapy. McNemar tests 
indicated that CBT-SAD subjects with recurrence in one, but not both, winters were just as 
likely to have their recurrence in either winter (p = .804), whereas light therapy subjects with 
recurrence in only one winter were significantly more likely to recur the second winter (p = .
003). These findings suggest greater durability of a treatment effect in CBT-SAD than light 
therapy.
 Treatment Utilization over Followup
Table 3 presents descriptive information for ongoing treatment utilization reported at each 
winter followup visit. All subjects who reported treatment on the October and/or December 
tracking phone calls also reported it at the next winter followup. Therefore, the more 
inclusive next winter followup reports are presented here. A larger proportion of light 
therapy than CBT-SAD subjects reported any treatment at next winter, but this difference 
was driven by 34.9% of light therapy subjects reporting continued light therapy as instructed

 (vs. only 7.1% of CBT-SAD subjects reporting light therapy). Consequently, the treatment 
groups did not differ in reports of any new treatment at next winter. At the second winter, the 
treatments did not differ in the proportions reporting any treatment or any new treatment, but 
more light therapy (30.6%) than CBT-SAD subjects (13.4%) reported using light therapy. 
CBT-SAD and light therapy subjects did not differ on psychotherapy or antidepressant 
medication use at either followup. Some cross-over was evident with generally more light 
therapy subjects pursuing psychotherapy than CBT-SAD subjects pursing light therapy.
Logistic and linear regression analyses indicated that differences between CBT-SAD and 
light therapy at second winter were not attributable to concurrent treatment(s), in general, or 
to any new treatment or ongoing light therapy, psychotherapy, or antidepressant medication, 
specifically. After adjustment for concurrent treatment utilization, CBT-SAD continued to 
have fewer SIGH-SAD recurrences and lower SIGH-SAD, BDI-II, and HAM-D scores the 
second winter than light therapy. The difference between CBT-SAD and light therapy in 
BDI-II remissions at second winter persisted with these adjustments, except when adjusted 
for ongoing light therapy. (See Table 4).
 Discussion
Outcomes for SAD patients initially treated with CBT-SAD or light therapy were 
comparable at followup the next winter, but differed two winters after initial treatment. 
Relative to light therapy, CBT-SAD was associated with fewer depression recurrences using 
SIGH-SAD criteria, more remissions based on BDI-II cutpoint, less severe blind 
interviewer-rated depression on the SIGH-SAD, and less severe patient-rated depression on 
the BDI-II at the second winter. The superiority of CBT-SAD over light therapy the second 
winter persisted after adjustment for any concurrent treatment, in general, and for any new 
treatment, psychotherapy, or antidepressant medications, specifically. Differences between 
CBT-SAD and light therapy were somewhat attenuated after adjustment for ongoing light 
therapy use, which was not unexpected because it is partially confounded with treatment. 
Nevertheless, BDI-II remission status at second winter was the only treatment group 
difference that became non-significant after adjusting for ongoing light therapy. Only two of 
the 11 (18.2%) CBT-SAD subjects reporting light therapy the second winter met BDI-II 
remission criteria compared to 69.0% of those who reported no light therapy. Interestingly, 
BDI-II remission the second winter was also lower in light therapy subjects who reported 
ongoing light therapy (38.5%) than in those who did not (47.5%), but the difference was 
much smaller than among CBT-SAD subjects. Light therapy use may be a marker for non-
remission at second winter, particularly following CBT-SAD.
These followup results are consistent with our prior study (7), except that treatment group 
differences emerged at the second winter here and were apparent at the next winter in our 
earlier study (7). In contrast to our prior work, the current protocol added the October and 
December phone calls to prospectively track depression recurrences and retreatment in the 
interim between treatment endpoint and the next winter. It is possible that these extra 
measures and timepoints created a testing effect in the light therapy group. Treatment 
differences emerged when subjects were “left to their own devices” between the next and

 second winter followups, as was the case at the single, naturalistic followup the next winter 
in our prior trial (7).
The following observations are consistent with the interpretation of a testing effect in the 
light therapy condition at next winter and also support the interpretation that CBT-SAD had 
an enduring effect that reduced risk of recurrence after acute treatment relative to light 
therapy. CBT-SAD subjects with a prospective SIGH-SAD recurrence at one followup were 
equally likely to recur in either winter. In contrast, light therapy subjects with SIGH-SAD 
recurrences at one followup were significantly more likely to recur at the second than the 
next winter. In addition, the predictive relation between next winter and second winter 
recurrence status was significantly stronger in CBT-SAD than in light therapy. Relative to 
subjects with recurrence at next winter, subjects without recurrence at next winter were 5-
times more likely to go without recurrence the second winter in CBT-SAD (versus just 2-
times more likely in light therapy).
Reinitiating light therapy each fall/winter season is widely regarded as the most effective 
means of preventing winter depression recurrence. To our knowledge, clinical trials that have 
prospectively followed SAD patients treated acutely with light therapy in subsequent winters 
are limited to our prior study (7) and the current study. Here, only about one-third of light 
therapy subjects reported continued light therapy at each followup, even though we 
explicitly prompted continued compliance and made our light boxes available to them the 
next winter. In our pilot study, only 2/19 (11%) light therapy subjects reported light use the 
next winter. These results suggest that providing CBT-SAD during acute treatment is a more 
effective means to reduce risk of recurrence than treating acute SAD with light therapy and 
instructing patients to resume light use each fall/winter, as practice guidelines recommend. 
Not resuming light therapy in future winters is problematic, given that light therapy is a 
palliative treatment that exerts its effects by suppressing symptoms as long as treatment is 
actively applied.
SAD research has generally focused on achieving acute remission without reference to 
longer-term outcomes, an approach that does not match the recurrent course of the disorder. 
These results underscore the importance of including longitudinal followup over subsequent 
winters in SAD clinical trial designs. There is currently no accepted benchmark for defining 
a SAD treatment failure, but we argue that recurrence is more clinically meaningful than 
post-treatment non-remission status. By that standard, our data suggest that slightly more 
than one-quarter of SAD patients initially treated with CBT-SAD and slightly less than one-
half of SAD patients initially treated with light therapy would require a next-step treatment 
strategy within the next two years. Therefore, there is room for improvement beyond these 
two empirically-validated SAD treatments, suggesting several future directions. Possible 
next steps to test empirically include maintenance strategies (e.g., early fall booster sessions 
focused on using CBT-SAD skills or motivational interviewing around continuing light 
therapy) and “switch” (i.e., cross-over) or “combine” decision-rules. Although our prior 
study found that solo CBT-SAD had greater benefit the next winter than CBT-SAD 
combined with light therapy (7), there might be a subgroup of patients that would benefit 
from combination treatment. Narrowing the pool to patients who failed a first-line solo

 treatment should help identify those for whom the benefit of combined treatment outweighs 
the cost.
In conclusion, our prior report found that CBT-SAD and light therapy are comparably 
effective treatment modalities for acute SAD (8), but these followup data show better 
outcomes for CBT-SAD than light therapy two winters later. Accordingly, CBT-SAD should 
be considered as an efficacious SAD treatment and disseminated into practice, particularly if 
the focus is on recurrence prevention.

Note. CBT-SAD = SAD-tailored cognitive-behavioral therapy. SIGH-SAD = Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression-Seasonal Affective Disorder Version; BDI-II = Beck 
Depression Inventory—2nd Edition; HAM-D = 21-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression; Atypical = 8-item, atypical subscale score of the SIGH-SAD. One light therapy participant completed the 
BDI-II, but not the SIGH-SAD at next winter followup. One CBT-SAD participant completed the BDI-II, but not the SIGH-SAD at second winter followup.
atotal SIGH-SAD score ≥ 20 + HAM-D score ≥ 10 + Atypical score ≥ 5.
b≥ 50% improvement in SIGH-SAD + HAM-D ≤ 7 + Atypical ≤ 7 OR HAM-D ≤ 2 + Atypical ≤10.

Note. See Table 1 for treatment abbreviations. Any new treatment excluded light therapy subjects who reported light therapy and CBT-SAD 
subjects who reported using CBT-SAD skills on their own without a therapist. Both of these scenarios represent fidelity to study treatment. 
Psychotherapy included only formal treatment with a provider. Therefore, for CBT-SAD subjects, any new treatment is equivalent to any treatment.
