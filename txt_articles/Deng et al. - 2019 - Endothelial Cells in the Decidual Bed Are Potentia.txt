In Brief
Deng et al. show a balance between
inflammation and anti-inflammation
involving endothelial and decidual cells in
pregnancy. Tipping this balance toward
inflammation contributes to preterm
birth. A mechanism to preserve
homeostatic balance in pregnancy under
inflammation is mediated by a cross-talk
between endothelial and perivascular
stromal cells.

SUMMARY
Preterm birth (PTB) is a syndrome with many origins.
Among them, infection or inflammation are major
risk factors for PTB; however, local defense mecha-
nisms to mount anti-inflammatory responses against
inflammation-induced PTB are poorly understood.
Here, we show that endothelial TLR4 in the decidual
bed is critical for sensing inflammation during preg-
nancy because mice with endothelial Tlr4 deletion
are resistant to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced
PTB. Under inflammatory conditions, IL-6 is readily
expressed in decidual endothelial cells with signal
transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3)
phosphorylation in perivascular stromal cells, which
then regulates expression of anti-inflammatory IL-
10. Our observation that administration of an IL-10
neutralizing antibody predisposing mice to PTB
shows IL-10’s anti-inflammatory role to prevent
PTB. We show that the integration of endothelial
and perivascular stromal signaling can determine
pregnancy outcomes. These findings highlight a
role for endothelial TLR4 in inflammation-induced
PTB and may offer a potential therapeutic target to
prevent PTB.
INTRODUCTION
Preterm birth (PTB) is a leading cause of child mortality and
morbidity and often incurs life-long clinical and psychological
challenges for the survivors (Moster et al., 2008). Many risk fac-
tors, including genetic predisposition, bacterial infection or
inflammation, maternal aging, hormonal imbalances, and envi-
ronmental stresses, contribute toward this complex pathology
(Goldenberg et al., 2008; Romero et al., 2014). PTB can result
from both systemic and local inflammation in the reproductive
tract and/or feto-placental unit (Elovitz and Mrinalini, 2004). The
mechanism underlying PTB remains intangible, especially in hu-
mans due to logistical and ethical difficulties in accessing mean-
ingful samples. Suitable animal models to recapitulate the human
conditions are alternative viable options. Genetic and/or experi-
mentally manipulated mouse models predisposed to PTB can
mimic certain aspects of PTB in humans (Cha et al., 2013). In
this context, mouse models can provide the advantage of study-
ing gene-environment influences on PTB in a defined set of
experimental and dietary conditions as opposed to human
tissue analyses obtained from placentas under diverse settings.
Genetic mouse models can also offer opportunities to explore
the interplay between inflammatory and anti-inflammatory path-
ways in PTB. The availability of a sufficient number of placentas
from diverse groups with different ethnic backgrounds with
different food habits, living conditions, and environment may be
limiting factors to provide meaningful results. The scenario is
more challenging for the socioeconomically depressed popula-
tion groups, which often show higher rate of PTB. Because PTB
is a disorder with many origins (Romero et al., 2014), studies in
both animal models and humans will provide more meaningful re-
sults that could be relevant to humans and other species.
Both the maternal decidua and feto-placental unit are thought
to participate in PTB in response to infection or inflammation.
However, whether causes of PTB originate from the decidua,
placenta, and/or fetus has not been clearly distinguished. The
maternal decidua serves as a ‘‘signaling hub’’ that coordinates
interactions between the mother and feto-placental unit (Moffett
and Loke, 2006). Effective reciprocal cross-talk between the
decidua and feto-placental unit involving genetics, epigenetic
modification, and transcription factors in combination with mor-
phogens, cytokines, and signaling molecules creates a favor-
able milieu to support fetal growth and development and suc-
cessful completion of pregnancy (Romero et al., 2014; Rubens
et al., 2014). There is increasing interest in the decidua’s role in

 orchestrating the homeostatic balance between the mother and
fetus, and studies suggest that the decidua is a critical regulator
of birth timing and pregnancy well-being (Cha et al., 2013; Deng
et al., 2016; Hirota et al., 2011; Hirota et al., 2010).
LPS, a gram-negative bacterial lipopolysaccharide, is a lead-
ing cause of inflammation through increased production of cyto-
kines and chemokines. LPS primarily executes its function by
Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) (Miller et al., 2005). Until now, the
mechanism by which TLR4-induced inflammation induces PTB
has largely been descriptive. There are reports that decidual
macrophages and neutrophils express TLR4 and may play a
role in inflammation-induced PTB (Kadam et al., 2017; Robert-
son et al., 2018; Yan et al., 2018); whether other TLR4-express-
ing cells are involved in inflammation-induced PTB remains un-
known. Using genetic mouse models and breeding strategies,
we sought to dissect the role of maternal decidua apart from
the fetal-placental entity in response to systemic LPS injection.
The uterus is comprised of heterogeneous tissues and cell types,
and it is not known whether TLR4 expression and function are
tissue- or cell-specific. Here, we explored the site of TLR4-medi-
ated function in the uterus.
Using genetic and molecular approaches, we show that the
decidua is a major site of expression of TLR4, which is sensitive
to LPS exposure and release of cytokines. Further investigation
found that decidual endothelial TLR4 is primarily responsible
for rapid induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines if exposed to
systemic LPS administration. This inflammatory insult initiates
cross-talk between the decidual endothelial and perivascular
stromal cells to mount a counter, anti-inflammatory response.
Using conditional deletion of Tlr4 in deciduae by a Pgr-Cre driver,
we observed that dams with a loss of decidual Tlr4 have reduced
litter size and increased fetal resorption and they are highly sen-
sitive to PTB by an ultra-low dose of LPS. We found that Il6 is
induced in endothelial cells by LPS and associated with activa-
tion of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (pStat3)
in perivascular stromal cells; Stat3 activation is known to regu-
late Il10 expression. Intriguingly, the deletion of endothelial Tlr4
by a highly specific Tie2-Cre driver (Tie2Cre/+Tlr4f/f) shows resis-
tance to even a high dose of LPS (40 mg/mouse) to PTB in these
mice; this dose induces PTB in 100% of Tlr4f/f females. There is
evidence that interleukin-6 (IL-6) induces anti-inflammatory IL-10
expression through pStat3 (Saraiva and O’Garra, 2010). Indeed,
administration of IL-10-neutralizing antibodies predisposes mice
to PTB if exposed to a very low dose of LPS. Collectively, our re-
sults show tissue-specific interactions and responses to inflam-
mation to protect pregnancy against inflammatory insults. This
study elucidates a role for endothelial TLR4 in calibrating proin-
flammatory versus anti-inflammatory responses in the decidua
to determine the fate of pregnancy outcomes and inflamma-
tion-induced PTB in the context of LPS exposure and genetic
predisposition.
RESULTS
Differential TLR4 Expression in the Decidua and
Placenta
The uterus is comprised of heterogeneous tissue and cell types.
LPS primarily executes its function by TLR4, leading to increased
release of cytokines (Miller et al., 2005). It is not known if TLR4
function is tissue or cell type specific. TLRs belong to a large
family, and our RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data in isolated
mouse epithelial and stromal cells show that Tlr4 expression is
highest among other members of the family in stromal cells (Fig-
ure 1A). More interestingly, Tlr4 expression is much higher in day
16 deciduae than other organs, such as the liver, spleen, lung,
ovary, and placenta (Figure 1B). The lower Il10 expression in
the placenta also suggests that the decidua is more active in
anti-inflammatory responses (Figure S1A). As recently reported
(Nancy et al., 2018), RNA-seq data in purified stromal cells on
days 8 and 16 of pregnancy show highest Tlr4 expression in
deciduae, supporting our results and suggesting a potential
role of TLR4 in the decidua (Figures S1B and S1C). Our in situ
hybridization (ISH) results show that the expression of TLR4 is
highly localized in day 16 deciduae with much lower expression
in the placenta (Figure 1C), suggesting that the decidua is a po-
tential site that modulates the balance between inflammation
and anti-inflammation.
The above results prompted us to explore if TLR4 expression
exhibits a similar pattern in humans. Indeed, TLR4 expression
is highest among the family members in endometrial biopsies
obtained from 20 healthy fertile women in the mid-secretory
phase of the menstrual cycle, i.e., 8 days after luteinizing hor-
mone peak (LH+8) (Figure S1D) (Altma
¨ e et al., 2017). Another
recent study that used single-cell RNA-seq analyses of first
trimester deciduae and placentas shows that TLR4 expression
is much higher in decidual stromal cells, decidual fibroblasts,

 and decidual vascular endothelial cells than those in placental
cells (Figure S1E) (Suryawanshi et al., 2018). Higher expression
of TLR4 in the human endometrium compared with other
members is also seen in apparently normal patients in the
TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) database (Figure S1F). Taken
together, these results suggest that TLR4 in human decidual
cells may respond to inflammation/infection similar to that noted
in mice.
Role of TLR4 in Decidual Stromal Cells versus Decidual
Endothelial Cells
These results led us to explore the site of TLR4-mediated func-
tion in the pregnant mouse uterus. Our previous study showed
that genetically predisposed mice are extremely sensitive to
ultra-pure TLR4-specific LPS to induce PTB (Cha et al., 2013;
Deng et al., 2016). However, the homeostatic balance between
inflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses remains un-
known. Because progesterone receptors are expressed in all
major uterine cell types, we generated conditional Tlr4 mutant
mice using Pgr-Cre driver (PgrCre/+Tlr4f/f) to investigate the phys-
iological significance of TLR4 in the decidua (Figures 1C and
S2A-S2C). Increased incidence of embryo resorption is observed
in some mothers on day 16 but not apparent on day 8, along with
decreased live litter sizes, indicates an important role of TLR4
during pregnancy (Figures 1D–1F). We speculated that mice
with decidual deletion of Tlr4 should be resistant to LPS, similar
to that observed in Tlr4 systematic knockout mice (Tlr4�/�) (Wa-
hid et al., 2015). Unexpectedly, these PgrCre/+Tlr4f/f mice show
exquisite sensitivity to PTB even upon an exposure to a low
dose of LPS; LPS at 2.5 mg/mouse widely induces PTB (82%)
with 92% dead pups. This low dose does not elicit adverse ef-
fects in Tlr4f/f pregnant mice (Figures 1G and S2D). One may
argue that increased sensitivity of PgrCre/+Tlr4f/f mice is due to
compromised TLR4 activity in resident leucocytes. However,
co-staining of CD45, dolichos biflorus agglutinin (DBA)-lectin
(natural killer [NK] cells), F4/80, Ly6G, and CD4 with PR in day
16 deciduae shows no overlap, excluding the possibility of dele-
tion of TLR4 by the Pgr-Cre driver in decidual leucocyte popula-
tions (Figure S2E). Non-uterine tissues, such as spleen and liver,
do not show specific PR staining (Figure S3). Using T cell-specific
deletion of PR and glucocorticoid receptor (GR), it was shown
that P4-induced T cell death is mediated by GR but not PR (Hier-
weger et al., 2019). In a recent study, single-cell analysis of hu-
man decidual cells in the first trimester shows that PR expression
is very low to undetectable in NK cells, dendritic cells (DCs),
monocytes, macrophages, and T cells as opposed to a signifi-
cant presence of GR expression in these cell types. PR is primar-
ily expressed in stromal cells (Vento-Tormo et al., 2018).
IL-6 is considered important for both LPS-induced PTB and
normal delivery because the loss of Il6 shows delayed parturition
and resists LPS-triggered PTB (Robertson et al., 2010). To inves-
tigate responses of LPS over time, Tlr4f/f mice were treated with
LPS (2.5 mg) for 1, 3, and 6 hours. Both Il6 and Il10 were rapidly
induced at 1 hour followed by their gradual downregulation.
Cox2 was also induced at 1 hour with further increases at 3
and 6 hours (Figures S4A–S4C). Co-staining of CD31 and Cox2
presents evidence that Cox2 is induced in the endothelial cells
(Figure S4D). The finding of rapid induction of Il6 and Il10 in
day 16 decidua by LPS led us to analyze the expression of these
cytokines in Tlr4f/f and PgrCre/+Tlr4f/f mice. Surprisingly, the ex-
pressions of Il6 and Il10 are significantly induced in the decidua
by LPS in both Tlr4f/f and PgrCre/+Tlr4f/f mice with no induction of
these cytokines in Tlr4 systematic knockout mice (Figures 1H
and 1I).
Cross-Talk between Endothelial Cells and Perivascular
Stromal Cells
To further evaluate LPS-induced signaling pathways, nuclear
factor kappa B (NF-kB) and pStat3, critical mediators of inflam-
matory and anti-inflammatory responses, respectively, in the
context of cell types and experimental conditions, were investi-
gated after LPS injection. Western blotting analysis shows that
induction of pStat3 by LPS in Tlr4f/f and PgrCre/+Tlr4f/f mice is
comparable with no pStat3 induction in TLR4 systemic knockout
mice (Figures 2A and 2B). Our ISH results also show that Il6 and
Cox2 are induced in endothelial cells of PgrCre/+Tlr4f/f deciduae
after LPS treatment, similar to that of Tlr4f/f mice on day 16 (Fig-
ure 2C). Immunofluorescence (IF) as well as results of isolated
cytoplasm and nuclei reveal perivascular localization of pStat3
and nuclear translocation of NF-kB in endothelial cells in
PgrCre/+Tlr4f/f deciduae, which are similar to Tlr4f/f mice after
LPS exposure (Figures 2D–2F). The localization of pStat3 in the
decidual cells and CD31 in endothelial cells (Figures 2D, S4E,
and S4F) indicates a cross-talk between perivascular stromal
cells and endothelial cells.
Endothelial-Specific Deletion of Tlr4 Protects against
LPS-Induced PTB

 LPS. Induction of Il6 and Cox2 in endothelial cells led us to spec-
ulate that decidual endothelial TLR4 might contribute to this
disparity. To explore if endothelial TLR4 sufficiently responds
to LPS exposure, we first confirmed the expression of Tlr4 in
both Tlr4f/f and PgrCre/+Tlr4f/f mice. The persistent expression
of Tlr4 in PgrCre/+Tlr4f/f endothelial cells suggests that endothelial
TLR4 is an effective sensor to propagate LPS signaling to induce
PTB because Pgr-Cre is incapable of deleting endothelial Tlr4
(Figure 3A). Indeed, co-staining of PR and CD31 clearly shows
that endothelial cells in days 4 and 16 uterus are PR negative dur-
ing pregnancy (Figure 3B). We investigated the significance of
endothelial TLR4 by using a Tie2-Cre driver to circumvent
the limitation of the Pgr-Cre driver. The results from Tie2Cre/+
Rosa26Tomato reporter mice show that Tie2-Cre is primarily ex-
pressed in blood vessel endothelia in the decidua (Figure S4G).
We also observed that Tie2-Cre does not show any recombina-
tion in immune cells, indicating Tie2 expression is specific to
endothelial cells, which was verified by the absence of tomato
reporter in the stromal compartment (Figure S4G). The deletion
efficiency of Tlr4 was confirmed by qPCR and digoxin (DIG)-
ISH (Figures S4H and S4I). Tie2Cre/+Tlr4f/f mice exposed to LPS
show normal litter size and parturition without any apparent
adverse effects on viability and growth rate of pups or apparent
distress of the mother upon delivery (Figures 3C–3E and S4J). In
contrast to PgrCre/+Tlr4f/f mice, LPS at a low dose (2.5 mg/mouse)
does not provoke harmful effects in Tlr4f/f or Tie2Cre/+Tlr4f/f mice.
Tie2Cre/+Tlr4f/f mice were then challenged with a higher dose of
LPS (40 mg/mouse). Although 100% of Tlr4f/f mice show PTB at
this high dose, no observable deleterious effects were noted in
Tie2Cre/+Tlr4f/f mice. They show normal litter sizes and parturition
timing (Figures 3C–3E). The total abrogation of LPS-induced
PTB in Tie2Cre/+Tlr4f/f mice suggests that endothelial TLR4 acti-
vation is indispensable for LPS-triggered signal transduction in
the decidua.
To better understand the underlying cause of LPS resistance
in Tie2Cre/+Tlr4f/f mice, we examined the expression of inflamma-
tion-associated cytokines in Tlr4f/f and Tie2Cre/+Tlr4f/f mice in the
absence or presence of LPS. The expression of Cox2 and Il6 is
primarily induced in endothelial cells of Tlr4f/f mice by LPS but
not in Tie2Cre/+Tlr4f/f mice (Figures 3F and 3G). Our fluorescence
ISH (RNA-FISH) coupled with Il6 DIG probe is consistent with
radioactive ISH results (Figure S4K). qPCR results show that
both Il6 and Il10 are induced at low and high doses (2.5 or
40 mg/mouse) of LPS in Tlr4f/f mice, whereas these inductions
are not seen in Tie2Cre/+Tlr4f/f mice (Figures 4A and 4B). We
also observed higher induction of Il6 in Tlr4f/f mice in the pres-
ence of a higher dose of LPS (Figure 4A). The decreased ratio
of expression Il10/Il6 in Tlr4f/f mice at a high dose of LPS further
supports that the balance between pro-inflammation and anti-
inflammation is disturbed under higher LPS dose in floxed
mice (Figure 4C). This imbalance of IL-10 and IL-6 is likely to ac-
count for PTB at a higher dose of LPS.
IL-6 Can Activate Stat3 and Il10 Expression in Decidual
Cells in Culture
Activation of Stat3 (pStat3) is seen in Tlr4f/f deciduae after LPS
exposure, but this activation is absent in Tie2Cre/+Tlr4f/f mice af-
ter exposure to LPS (Figures 4D and 4E). To examine if IL-6 can
directly activate Stat3, isolated stromal cells from pregnant day 4
uterus were cultured to decidualized cells by estrogen and P4
(Deng et al., 2016), followed by exposure to IL-6. We found sig-
nificant nuclear pStat3 enrichment and elevated pStat3 levels
along with higher Il10 mRNA levels (Figures 4F–4H). IL-6 medi-
ates its function by engaging IL-6 receptor (Il6r) and Gp130 to
trigger Stat3 phosphorylation (Johnson et al., 2018). ISH results
show expression of Il6r and Gp130 in the decidua (Figure S5A).
qPCR results show that their expression levels are comparable
in both genotypes with or without LPS exposure (Figure S5E).
Furthermore, cytoplasmic NF-kB fails to translocate to endo-
thelial cell nuclei after LPS treatment in Tie2Cre/+Tlr4f/f mice (Fig-
ure 5A). CD14 is a co-receptor of TLR4 for LPS binding and
cellular uptake; its expression is dependent on NF-kB signaling
(Zanoni et al., 2011). Our results show that CD14 is primarily
induced by LPS in endothelial cells in Tlr4f/f mice but not in
Tie2Cre/+Tlr4f/fmice,suggestingthatNF-kBactivation intheendo-
thelium is abrogated in Tie2Cre/+Tlr4f/f mice (Figures 5B and 5C).
Resident Decidual Immune Cells Are Not a Target of LPS
Because immune cells are considered a major source of cyto-
kines, we examined the distribution of immune cells in deciduae
after exposure to LPS. An abundant population of uterine NK
(uNK) cells were noted in deciduae of both Tlr4f/f and Tie2Cre/+
Tlr4f/f mice, but their distribution patterns were comparable after
LPS challenge in the presence or absence of endothelial TLR4
(Figure S5B). As Stat3 is important for the production of cytokines
in NK cells (Saraiva and O’Garra, 2010), we explored if pStat3 is
activated in uNK cells after LPS treatment. Co-staining shows
that pStat3 and uNK cells are rarely co-localized in the presence
of LPS (Figure S5C). The unaltered expression of GzmA and
GzmC, major markers of NK cells, is consistent with the finding
of unaltered distribution of uNKs (Figures S5D and S5E).
The number of macrophages is scanty in the decidua and
restricted in the myometrium as previously reported (Nancy
et al., 2012; Tachi and Tachi, 1986). Macrophage population

 remains unchanged before and after LPS challenge for 1 and 6
hours (Figures S6 and S7) and that neutrophil distribution was
rare in uterine decidua even after LPS exposure; only a few are
seen adhered to the endothelium (Figures S6 and S7). The stain-
ing of CD45, a common marker of leukocytes, also did not show
obvious changes in distribution (Figures S6 and S7), suggesting
that endothelial TLR4 is minimally or not engaged with immune
cells to produce cytokines in the decidua to provoke PTB. Similar
to PgrCre/+Tlr4f/f mice, the immune cells do not exhibit PR
expression in Tie2Cre/+Tlr4f mice (Figures S6 and S7).
The Ovary Is Not a Target of PTB When LPS Is Given on
Day 16
There are reports that LPS targets the ovary and induces PTB by
reducing P4 levels (Aisemberg et al., 2013; Cha et al., 2013). Our
results show that Tlr4 expression is quite low in the ovary (Fig-
ure 1B), and evidence suggests that decidual health, as evident
from the expression of PlpJ and Prlr, is critical for the functional
lifespan of the corpus luteum (Cha et al., 2013). To circumvent
the effects of LPS-induced ovarian steroid hormonal changes,
day 16 pregnant females were ovariectomized and injected
with a combination of hormones, which maintains pregnancy
with normal parturition timing. In contrast, an LPS (40 mg) injec-
tion on day 16 along with similar hormones injections induces
PTB within 48 hours with stillbirths (Figures 6A and 6B). Consid-
ering the high abundance of TLR4 expression in the decidua with
rapid response to LPS, these results strongly support that the
decidua is a direct target of LPS and by inference other bacterial
infections. Downregulation of Prlr by LPS in Tlr4f/f mice but not in
Tie2Cre/+Tlr4f/f mice further supports that LPS dampens decidual
health through endothelial TLR4 (Figures 6C and 6D).
IL-10 Confers Protection against PTB in Response to
Inflammation
IL-10 is an anti-inflammatory cytokine and safeguards against
infection or inflammation, and Stat3 is considered a major regu-
lator of IL-10 expression (Saraiva and O’Garra, 2010). The mining
of the published chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing
(ChIP-seq) database suggests a potential Stat3 binding site at
the downstream region of Il10 gene and histone modification at
the promoter region (Figures 6E and 6F). We verified the binding
by ChIP-qPCR by using both pStat3 and Stat3 antibodies as well
as H3K4me3 antibody in LPS-treated decidua (Figures 6G and
6H); samples from untreated uteri were below the detection
levels. Our results suggest that IL-10 is transcriptionally and
epigenetically regulated by LPS.
We next asked if neutralization of IL-10 enhances PTB inci-
dence. IL-10 knockout mice are extremely sensitive to external
infection and show inflammatory bowel disease syndrome
(K€
uhn et al., 1993). Therefore, we adopted a different approach
to neutralize endogenous IL-10. A neutralizing antibody to IL-10
(500 mg/mouse) was injected into both wild-type (WT) (p53f/f)
andPTB predisposed mice(PgrCre/+p53f/f) 30 min before andafter
an LPS injection on day 16 to monitor parturition timing (Clem-
ente-Casares et al., 2016). We found increased incidence of
PTB in both genotypes even at a dose as low as 1 mg/mouse
LPS with increased incidence of PTB in predisposed mice (Fig-
ures 7A and 7B). Normally, administration of 2.5 mg LPS does
not lead to any adverse pregnancy effects in p53f/f (WT) mice,
but administration of an IL-10 neutralizing antibody substantially
increases the sensitivity of these mice to LPS. To better under-
stand the underlying mechanism of increased PTB rate upon
IL-10 inhibition, decidualized stromal cells were treated with an
anti-IL-10 antibody. Increased phosphorylated nuclear factor
NF-kappa-B (pNFkB) levels indicate heightened inflammation
after administration of IL-10 neutralizing antibody (Figure 7C).
pS6 levels are also substantially elevated by the IL-10 antibody
(Figure 7C), mimicking some aspects of LPS-treated deciduae
(Figure 2A). Notably, higher levels of Il6, Tnf, and Il1b after IL-10
neutralization also suggest the anti-inflammatory role of IL-10 in
decidualized stromal cells (Figures 7D–7F). Our previous results
suggest that increased mTORC1 signaling is an important deter-
minant of PTB. Thus, increased pS6 levels by LPS and anti-IL-10
indicates that the function of IL-10 in parturition at least partially
influences the mTORC1 signaling pathway, which is supported
by a recent study (Ip et al., 2017).
DISCUSSION
Our observation of abundant expression of TLR4 in the decidua
suggests that the signal transduced by this member of the TLR
family plays a functional role during normal pregnancy. In this
respect, the findings of highest levels of Tlr4 mRNA among the
other family members in the decidua support TLR4 function in
pregnancy outcomes. In contrast, surprisingly low levels of
Tlr4 expression in the placenta suggest that the decidua plays
a major role in modulating systemic infection or inflammation
during pregnancy, although placental roles in regulating inflam-
matory and anti-inflammatory responses under local microbial
infection cannot be ruled out. We have provided evidence that
endothelial TLR4 in coordination with perivascular stromal cells
in the decidual bed calibrates the degree of inflammatory and

 anti-inflammatory responses to inflammation in pregnancy. The
role of endothelial TLR4 has not been widely explored in other
systems, although our results are consistent with only two pub-
lished reports showing a protective role of endothelial TLR4
deletion in the intestine and brain (Tang et al., 2017; Yazji
et al., 2013). Here, we show that endothelial TLR4 in the decidual
bed is also a major target for inflammation-induced PTB, but the
function of decidual TLR4 remains obscure. However, compro-
mised pregnancy outcomes of PgrCre/+Tlr4f/f mice in the
absence of LPS and sensitivity of these mice to LPS driving
PTB suggest that decidual TLR4 has a role in pregnancy, the
function of which is not clearly understood at this time and is a
subject of future investigation.
In this study, we provide evidence that the decidua functions
as a rheostat to establish a homeostatic balance between
inflammation and anti-inflammation following infection or inflam-
mation in pregnancy, and this balance is crucial to pregnancy
success. This study shows that the decidua is endowed with
anti-inflammatory activity that can offset certain inflammatory re-
sponses. Under infection or inflammation, the dynamic balance
is challenged, and PTB occurs if the degree of inflammation is
excessive. Our results illustrate a rapid inflammatory response
after LPS challenge in day 16 deciduae that gradually decreases
to a basal level. The prompt release of inflammatory cytokines af-
ter LPS exposure often generates an inflammatory cytokine
stress in genetically predisposed mice, such as PgrCre/+p53f/f
mice (Hirota et al., 2010) or PgrCre/+Tlr4f/f mice. These mice expe-
rience PTB, even after a small dose of LPS challenge that is toler-
able in normal pregnant mice.
The expression of IL-6 and Cox2 in decidual endothelial cells
and induction of pStat3 in the nuclei of perivascular decidual
cells following LPS stimulation perhaps initiate a cascade of
signaling events. Myometrial contractions driven by increased
prostaglandin F2a (PGF2a) is considered important for delivery.
However, previous and present results show that Cox2 expres-
sion is primarily expressed in the decidual stromal cells and
endothelial cells, but not muscle cells, under normal and after
LPS challenge. These results suggest that PGs originating in
the decidua influence myometrial contractility (Hirota et al.,
2010). Because IL-6 is known to activate Stat3 (Johnson et al.,
2018; Yasukawa et al., 2003), it is assumed that IL-6 induces
perivascular Stat3 phosphorylation, which is promptly followed

 by anti-inflammatory responses as a protective measure, as
seen in WT mice in response to mild inflammation (low LPS
doses) to preserve pregnancy. PTB ensues if the initial inflam-
matory response is overwhelming and overcomes physio-
logic anti-inflammatory responses, as seen in PTB-predisposed
mice. Enhanced expression of pro-inflammatory mediators with
dysfunctional anti-inflammatory pathways in Stat3-deleted
macrophages and neutrophils suggests anti-inflammatory ef-
fects of Stat3 (Takeda et al., 1999). We suspect that pStat3 in
decidual cells also confers protection against inflammation by
regulating IL-10 expression, which is supported by studies in
other systems (Saraiva and O’Garra, 2010). IL-10 is one of the
earliest identified anti-inflammatory cytokines upregulated after
LPS injection (Manzanillo et al., 2015). Our findings of increased
decidual levels of IL-10 by LPS suggest that this cytokine plays a
critical role in maintaining a homeostatic balance between the
pro- and anti-inflammatory responses to resist PTB within a
certain limit of infection or predisposition.
It is possible that resident immune cells in the decidua have a
role in responding to LPS exposure in pregnancy. Although it
cannot be completely excluded, our results show comparable
distribution of CD45-positive cells in Tlr4f/f and Tie2Cre/+Tlr4f/f
deciduae after LPS treatment. These results suggest that im-
mune cells do not play a major role in generating cytokines at
the early stage of LPS challenge in the decidua. This is consistent
with the observation that T cells and macrophages are predom-
inantly confined to the myometrium in normal pregnancy (Nancy
et al., 2012; Tachi and Tachi, 1986). Notably, deciduae on day 16
shows abundant NK (uNK) cells, which are thought to participate
in vessel remodeling and nourishing the developing embryo (Fu
et al., 2017). However, the distribution of uNK cells remains
unaltered in the decidua after LPS treatment. In this context,
our results suggest that decidual endothelial cells are endowed
with a function that was previously attributed to immune cells.
It is possible that increases in inflammatory circulating cyto-
kines originating from other organs contribute to PTB after LPS
challenge. Whether circulating cytokines can directly target
endothelial cells and then stromal cell gene expression is not
known. It is more reasonable that local production of these cyto-
kines by endothelial TLR4 in response to LPS or gram-negative

 bacteria would induce gene expression in a paracrine manner in
perivascular stromal cells in the decidua. A comprehensive un-
derstanding to address this issue would necessitate generation
of endothelial-specific Cre drivers for each organ, but this is a
daunting task with the current state of our knowledge. Nonethe-
less, a critical role of endothelial TLR4 to mount an inflammatory
insult to pregnancy after an injection of LPS is profound. TLR4
expression and its functions in resident immune cells in the
decidua and uterus in PTB are not clearly understood at this
time. Under our experimental conditions, Tie2 and PR are not
expressed in these immune cells. Furthermore, Tie2Cre/+Tlr4f/f
mice fail to evoke PTB with intact TLR4 in resident immune cells
upon exposure to LPS even at a higher dose (40 mg/mouse).
These results suggest that endothelial cell TLR4 is a primary
inducer of PTB after LPS challenge.
Our previous studies have shown that decreased 5ʹ-AMP-acti-
vated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling with heightened mTORC1
activity contributes to premature decidual aging, leading to
increased predisposition to infection or inflammation and PTB

(G) A representative scheme of a physiological role
of endothelial TLR4 in LPS-induced inflammation.
After binding with LPS, endothelial TLR4 directs
NFkB nuclear translocation to stimulate endothelial
IL-6 expression in endothelial cells. Locally gener-
ated IL-6 stimulates Stat3 phosphorylation in peri-
vascular decidual cells for IL-10 expression. Acti-
vation of endothelial TLR4 by LPS, which counters
endogenous IL-10 production, results in preterm
birth. CD14 is a co-receptor for TLR4 and highly
induced in endothelial cells after LPS stimulation.
(Cha et al., 2013; Deng et al., 2016; Hirota
et al., 2011; Hirota et al., 2010). Therefore,
restraining adverse effects of mTORC1
signaling by IL-10 could be a mechanism
by which this anti-inflammatory cytokine
protects pregnancy from inflammatory in-
sults (Ip et al., 2017).
IL-10 expression is regulated by many
pathways and transcription factors (Sar-
aiva and O’Garra, 2010). The spatiotem-
poral relationship of Stat3 phosphorylation
and IL-10 induction after LPS stimulation in
deciduae strongly suggest a connection
between them. Stat3 has been shown to promote both pro-in-
flammatory and anti-inflammatory effects through fine tuning of
the expression of cytokines, such as IL-12 and IL-23 (Kortylewski
et al., 2009), and a similar relationship between IL-10 and IL-6
is envisioned in the decidua, in which the ratio is likely to shift
the balance toward or against a pro-inflammatory response in
pregnancy. Our results of the ratio of Il10/Il6 mRNAs toward
pro-inflammation under high doses of LPS leading to PTB
corroborate this conjecture.
The observation that TLR4-dependent nuclear translocation
of NFkB in endothelial cells and Stat3 activation in the perivas-
cular decidual stromal cells with induction of cytokines by LPS
suggests that one function of the decidua is to counter infection
or inflammation during pregnancy within a certain limit but fails
to do so in genetically predisposed mothers to PTB. The func-
tion of TLR4 in humans is not clearly understood. One study
suggests that TLR4 is one of the master regulators for human
delivery through regulation of a cohort of gene expression (Lui
et al., 2018).

 Taken together, this work reveals a potential mechanism of
anti-inflammatory activity of IL-10 regulated by endothelial TLR4
in deciduae (Figure 7G). We provide evidence of transcriptional
regulation of IL-10 by Stat3 in the decidua. Considering that a
similar signature of IL-10 expression and regulation operates in
human deciduae, our findings may contribute to potential strate-
giestocombatPTB.Inconclusion,ourpresentresultsputforward
a concept that decidual endothelial cells are critical for mounting
inflammation resulting from infection with subsequent activation
of anti-inflammation machinery in late pregnancy.

EXPERIMENTAL MODELS AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Animal care and housing
PgrCre/+Tlr4f/f and Tie2Cre/+Tlr4f/f female mice were generated by crossing Tlr4 floxed (Tlr4f/f, C57BL/6,129 mixed background)
females with PgrCre/+ and Tie2Cre/+ males (C57BL/6,129 and albino B6 mixed background) (Kisanuki et al., 2001; Soyal et al.,
2005). Tie2Cre/+Rosa26tdTomato mice were generated by crossing Tie2cre/+ males with Rosa26tdTomato female mice (Jackson lab).
PgrCre/+p53f/f mice were generated by crossing p53 floxed mice (Hirota et al., 2010) with PgrCre/+ males. Tlr4 floxed mice have pre-
viously been described and were originally obtained from Chris Karp’s group (McAlees et al., 2015). Tlr4�/� (C57BL/6,129 mixed
background) mice have previously been described (Hoshino et al., 1999). At least three female mice from each genotype were
used for individual experiments. All mice used in this study were housed in the Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center Animal
Care Facility according to NIH and institutional guidelines for the use of laboratory animals. All protocols of the present study were
reviewed and approved by the Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Research Foundation Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
Mice were given autoclaved rodent LabDiet 5010 (Purina) and UV light–sterilized RO/DI constant circulation water ad libitum and
were housed under a constant 12-hour light/12-hour dark cycle.
Cell cultures and treatments
Stromal cells from day 4 of WT pregnant mice were collected by enzymatic digestion as previously described (Deng et al., 2016). The
purity of stromal was confirmed by Vimentin and Desmin staining according to our published study (Daikoku et al., 2005). Isolated
stromal cells were decidualized by estradiol-17b (E2, 10 nM) and progesterone (P4, 1 mM) in phenol red–free DMEM/F12 media sup-
plemented with charcoal-stripped 1% FBS (vol/vol) for 4 days and medium was changed every 2 days.
METHOD DETAILS
Analysis of pregnancy outcomes
Three adult females from each genotype were housed with floxed fertile males from respective backgrounds overnight in separate
cages. Successful mating (day 1 of pregnancy) was defined as the morning of finding the presence of a vaginal plug. Plug-positive
females were housed separately until processed for experiments. Litter size, pregnancy rate and outcomes were monitored in timed
pregnant mice. Ultrapure TLR4-specific LPS (2.5 mg/mouse and 40 mg/mouse, InvivoGen) was administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) on
day 16 of pregnancy. Parturition was monitored from days 16 through 21 by daily observation of mice in the morning, noon and
evening. Birth timing was defined by the observation of the first pup born. PTB was defined as birth occurring earlier than day 19
of pregnancy (day 1 = vaginal plug in the morning). Resorption sites and placental scars were identified in dams showing preterm
or difficult deliveries by examination of the uterus. The number of pups/masses delivered was compared with the number of
resorption sites and placental scars. Anti-IL10 antibody (500 mg/mouse, i.p., custom made, JES5-2A5) (Clemente-Casares et al.,
2016) was injected in both p53f/f and PgrCre/+p53f/f mice 30 min before and after LPS injection (1 mg/mouse, i.p.). At least three inde-
pendent mice in each genotype were used for biochemical and immunostaining assays.
Immunofluorescence (IF)
Frozen sections (12 mm) were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). After blocking in 5% BSA, sections were incubated with specific
primary antibodies at 4�C overnight (Yuan et al., 2016). After incubation with first antibody, slides were incubated in secondary
antibodies conjugated with Cy-2, Cy-3, Alexa 488 or Alexa 594 (1:300, Jackson Immuno Research). Nuclear staining was performed
using Hoechst 33342 (1:500, H1399, Thermo Scientific).

 RNA Isolation and qPCR
RNA from tissue or cells in TRIzol was extracted by chloroform and isopropanol. Up to 500ng total RNA after removing genomic DNA
from each sample was reverse transcribed with cDNA kit, and quantitative RT-PCR was performed in ABI Thermal Cyclers Real-Time
PCR machine by 2-DDCT method (Yuan et al., 2018). rpL7 served as an internal control and the relative expression was calculated
according to manufacturer’s protocol.
Immunoblotting
Samples were homogenized in RIPA buffer with protease and phosphatase inhibitors and quantified using a BCA kit. The protein
extracts were run in 10% Bis-acrylamide gel and transferred to PVDF membranes. After blocking in 5% non-fat milk, the membranes
were incubated with indicated antibodies overnight in 4�C. The membranes were washed in TBS-T and incubated with HRP conju-
gated secondary antibodies. The signal was visualized with an ECL kit.
Isolations of nuclei and cytoplasm
Deciduae from day 16 were collected and dissected from placenta, then subjected to homogenization by Dounce tissue grinder in
PBS with proteinase and phosphatase inhibitors. After centrifuging, cells were resuspended in Buffer A (10 mM HEPES pH7.9, 10mM
KCl, 0.1mM EDTA, 1mM DTT and 0.5mM PMSF, 2.5% NP40). Then the samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 15000 rpm. The
supernatant was kept for cytoplasm and the remaining nuclei were dissolved in Buffer C (20 mM HEPES pH7.9, 400mM NaCl,
1mM EDTA, 1mM DTT and 1mM PMSF) by vibrating for 30 mins. Both cytoplasm and nuclei were normalized to the same concen-
trations of protein.
In situ hybridization
Paraformaldehyde-fixed frozen sections from control and experimental groups were processed onto poly-L-lysine-coated slides and
hybridized in formamide buffer with specific 35S-labeled cRNA probes. The slides were then coated with Carestream NTB emulsion
and autoradiographs were developed and visualized under a Nikon dark-field microscope. Mouse-specific anti-sense cRNA probes
for Cox2, Il6, Tlr4 GzmA, GzmC, Il6r and Gp130 were used. For DIG-ISH, DIG-labeled probes were generated according to the man-
ufacturer’s protocol (Roche). After hybridization in formamide buffer, the slides were blocked in blocking buffer and incubated with
Alkaline Phosphatase conjugated anti-Dig antibody and visualized by NBT/BCIP substrate (Yuan et al., 2016).
RNA-FISH
Fluorescence in situ hybridization was developed in our lab based on previously established DIG in situ hybridization (Yuan et al.,
2016). In brief, following proteinase K (5 mg/ml) digestion and acetylation, slides were hybridized with DIG-labeled probes at
55�C. Anti-Dig-peroxidase was applied onto hybridized slides following washing and peroxide quenching. Color was developed
by TSA (Tyramide signal amplification) Fluorescein according to the manufacturer’s instructions (PerkinElmer).
ChIP-PCR Assays
Day 16 decidua tissues from vehicle and LPS treated group were homogenized by Dounce tissue grinder in cold PBS with proteinase
and phosphatase inhibitors. After centrifuging, the decidual stromal cells were washed with PBS and fixed in 10 mL of PBS containing
1% formaldehyde, then terminated by adding 2.5 M glycine. After incubation in Mg-NI buffer (15 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2,
60 mM KCl, 0.5 mM DTT, 15 mM NaCl, and 300 mM sucrose) and Mg-NI-Nonidet P-40 buffer (Mg-NI buffer with 1% Nonidet P-40),
cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (1% SDS, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 0.5 mM EDTA) and sonicated by repeating a
program (15 s on and 30 s off at 45% amplitude) 8 times. After the samples were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min to pellet
cell debris, the soluble chromatin was harvested. Immunoprecipitation was performed by incubation with antibody coated magnet
beads. After washing, DNA was eluted from the beads and subjected to Real-time PCR with specific primers.
Identification of whole-genome binding sites of Stat3 and H3K4me3
The datasets used in this study were from GSM540722 (Durant et al., 2010) and GSE60005 (Choukrallah et al., 2015). Sequenced
reads were aligned to the mouse genome (mm9) by bowtie2 (Langmead and Salzberg, 2012). Only non-redundant reads that passed
the quality score were kept for downstream analysis. MACS2 (Model-Based Analysis of ChIP-Seq)(Zhang et al., 2008) was used to
identify the peaks. The peaks were visualized in IGV browser.
Expression status of Tlrs identified by RNA-Seq analysis
Day 4 stromal and epithelial cells were isolated by enzyme digestion and total mRNA were extracted by TRIzol (Yuan et al., 2018).
Total rRNAs were removed by RiboZero and the remaining RNAs were sequenced by HiSeq2500. The RNA-seq results of reported
decidualized mouse stromal cells from day 8 and day 16 (Nancy et al., 2018) were re-analyzed by Tophat2 (Kim et al., 2013) and
visualized by R (GEO: GSE105456). The RNA-Seq data of human normal endometrium data was downloaded from TCGA (The
Cancer Genome Atlas) Data Portal. The expression of TLR4 in human endometrium cells was represented by RSEM (RNA-Seq by
Expectation-Maximization) and visualized by R.
