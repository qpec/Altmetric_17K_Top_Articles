Background: Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is a potential source for tumor genome analysis. We explored the concordance
between the mutational status of RAS in tumor tissue and ctDNA in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients to establish
eligibility for anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) therapy.
Patients and methods: A prospective-retrospective cohort study was carried out. Tumor tissue from 146 mCRC patients was
tested for RAS status with standard of care (SoC) PCR techniques, and Digital PCR (BEAMing) was used both in plasma and tumor
tissue.
Results: ctDNA BEAMing RAS testing showed 89.7% agreement with SoC (Kappa index 0.80; 95% CI 0.71 � 0.90) and BEAMing
in tissue showed 90.9% agreement with SoC (Kappa index 0.83; 95% CI 0.74 � 0.92). Fifteen cases (10.3%) showed discordant
tissue-plasma results. ctDNA analysis identified nine cases of low frequency RAS mutations that were not detected in tissue, pos-
sibly due to technical sensitivity or heterogeneity. In six cases, RAS mutations were not detected in plasma, potentially explained
by low tumor burden or ctDNA shedding. Prediction of treatment benefit in patients receiving anti-EGFR plus irinotecan in se-
cond- or third-line was equivalent if tested with SoC PCR and ctDNA. Forty-eight percent of the patients showed mutant allele
fractions in plasma below 1%.
Conclusions: Plasma RAS determination showed high overall agreement and captured a mCRC population responsive to anti-
EGFR therapy with the same predictive level as SoC tissue testing. The feasibility and practicality of ctDNA analysis may translate
into an alternative tool for anti-EGFR treatment selection.

Introduction
In metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), treatment with anti-
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) monoclonal antibodies
cetuximab or panitumumab has demonstrated efficacy in wild-
type (WT) RAS mutations and it is now considered imperative
this determination at the time of diagnosis [1, 2]. Formalin-fixed,

 currently used as standard of care (SoC) for RAS testing and is
considered the gold standard [3].
Circulating-free DNA (cfDNA) is natural DNA present in the
cell-free fraction of blood. Recent studies have suggested that
genomic alterations in solid tumors may be characterized by
studying the circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) released from can-
cer cells into the plasma [4]. In mCRC, ctDNA is detected in al-
most all patients but the low abundance requires highly sensitive
techniques to study mutations present at low frequencies. This
approach represents a liquid non-invasive biopsy with a potential
for determining RAS status. The main benefits are based on the
safety and convenience associated with minimally invasive pro-
cedures, accessibility at any time point—that favor dynamic/evo-
lutive evaluation—and is not affected by sample selection bias,
although accuracy and concordance with tumor-based tech-
niques has not been fully elucidated in patients from clinical prac-
tice [5–7].
Here, we carried out a concordance biomarker analysis of 146
mCRC patients using plasma and tissue-based RAS mutation
testing with BEAMing and SoC techniques in both specimens.
Discordant results were analyzed in-depth taking into consider-
ation both technical and clinical conditions. We investigated the
value of this determination in terms of progression-free survival
(PFS) in patients who had received anti-EGFR as well as overall
survival (OS) and mutant allele fraction (MAF) analysis.
Materials and methods
Study design
This prospective-retrospective study recruited patients candidate for
therapy from three Spanish hospitals as well as from a phase II multicen-
tric TTD ULTRA clinical trial (NCT01704703) for prospective biomarker
investigation. It was approved by the ethics committees of each hospital
and all patients provided written informed consent. Patients were
required to have a diagnosis of mCRC with available tumor tissue for mu-
tational analysis, have not received anti-EGFR agents before plasma col-
lection, and have evidence of measurable disease according to Response
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 [8].
Plasma was obtained from 10 ml of blood and all patients had FFPE
tissue (either primary tumor or metastasis) with >15% tumor area.
Tumor tissue area was evaluated by the pathologist taking into consider-
ation the amount of sample occupied by the tumor in a standardized
procedure.
All samples were analyzed blinded to the study endpoints. Full descrip-
tion in supplementary methods, available at Annals of Oncology online.
RAS mutational analysis
RAS status determination was carried out with available plasma and
tumor tissue using BEAMing and Real-Time PCR as SoC technique. The
DNA extracted from FFPE tissue sections was partitioned and used for
both determinations (BEAMing and real-time PCR). The panel of RAS
mutations evaluated with BEAMing was identical to that previously vali-
dated (supplementary Table S1, available at Annals of Oncology online)
[2]. Each plasma and tumor sample was independently processed (using
an 8-step workflow, supplementary Figure S1, available at Annals of
Oncology online). In discordant cases the historical RAS reports were re-
viewed and further RAS determinations were carried out when metasta-
ses tissue was available, using SoC techniques (supplementary Table S2,
available at Annals of Oncology online).
Depending on the specific assay, samples with a detectable mutation
rate above 0.02%–0.04% were considered positive using BEAMing in
ctDNA and 1% in tumor tissue. CtDNA testing was carried out with the
commercially available CE-IVD BEAMing RAS plasma kit with the same
thresholds for the specific mutations.
The sensitivity for Real-Time PCR as SoC analysis in tumor tissue is
�1%–5%. Full description in supplementary methods and Table S3,
available at Annals of Oncology online.

Results
Patient characteristics
A total of 157 mCRC patients were initially included, 11 of whom
were excluded because of specific pre-analytical requirements or
lack of tumor tissue availability (supplementary Figure S2, avail-
able at Annals of Oncology online).
Patient baseline characteristics, number and location of metas-
tasis, and number and description of previous lines of therapy are
summarized in supplementary Table S4, available at Annals of
Oncology online.
Overall, 61 (42%) patients were naı
¨ve for therapy in the meta-
static setting at the time of ctDNA collection, while the remaining
85 (58%) patients had received a range of treatments but all were
anti-EGFR therapies naive. The median time from tumor tissue
specimen to ctDNA collection was 1.2 months (range 0–34) in
therapy-naive patients. The range in previously exposed patients
was wide, with a median of 20.2 months (range 0.4–282). A group
of 67 (46%) patients received anti-EGFR immediately after
ctDNA collection mainly in second and third line (supplemen-
tary Table S4, available at Annals of Oncology online). Median
PFS and median OS were described in supplementary Table S5,
available at Annals of Oncology online.
Correlation between RAS status in tissue and
plasma
Using qPCR, we found tumor tissue samples positive for KRAS
mutations in 44/146 samples (30%) and NRAS mutations in 10/
146 (7%) (Table 1; supplementary Table S6, available at Annals of
Oncology online). Using BEAMing in tissue samples, KRAS muta-
tions were detected in 49/130 (38%) available samples and NRAS
mutations in 11/130 (8%). For ctDNA analysis, 46/146 (31%)
and 11/146 (8%) plasma samples harbored KRAS and NRAS mu-
tations, respectively.
Figure 1 shows concordance of RAS status between the three
methods. ctDNA analysis showed a Cohen’s Kappa estimate of
0.80 (95% CI 0.71–0.90) compared with tumor tissue evaluated
by SoC reflecting almost perfect agreement according to Landis
and Koch classification [9]. Results were similar for RAS status in
plasma and tissue using BEAMing with a Kappa index of 0.79
(95% CI 0.69–0.89), and in tumor tissue using SoC and
BEAMing a Kappa index of 0.83 (95% CI 0.74–0.92).

 Discordant samples description
In the population of samples with discordance between RAS status
according to ctDNA BEAMing and tissue by SoC, two groups were
identified, as detailed below (Table 2). To clarify these cases, the his-
torical RAS testing was reviewed and additional RAS determinations
were carried out by SoC in metastases whenever tissue was available
(supplementary Table S2, available at Annals of Oncology online).
Group A includes patients with evidence of mutations detected
in plasma but not in tissue by SoC techniques. In the first five
cases the SoC tissue technique failed to detect mutations that
were detected in the same tumor sample by BEAMing (Table 2).
Interestingly, in cases 1 and 2, SoC analysis of additional meta-
static samples showed the same mutations as those found in
plasma supporting the concept that plasma can be used to cap-
ture tumor heterogeneity. Likewise, in cases 4 and 5 the historical
reports showed identical mutated as plasma BEAMing but the
new qPCR result was WT.
On the remaining four cases (ID 6–9) of this group the muta-
tion detected by plasma BEAMing could not be identified by any
other tumor sampling test. These cases appeared not to have spe-
cific clinicopathologic features or differential tissue sampling
timing.
In group B, mutations were detected in tissue but not in plasma
in six patients (Table 2). In this group, we also reviewed the CT
scan carried out closest to the blood extraction to calculate tumor
burden. Patient 10 had small hepatic lesions (<1.5 cm) and

 patient 11 had only three peritoneal lesions, both of which reflect
low tumor burden. For three patients (ID 12–14), plasma extrac-
tion was carried out during the course of chemotherapy, which
may have altered ctDNA detection. The immediate RECIST 1.1
response after plasma extraction was also reviewed. The last case
(ID 15) had discordant results between tissue BEAMing and SoC
evaluations even though the DNA for this analysis originated
from the same tumoral tissue block. Again, these cases did not
have any other particular clinic-pathologic features or differential
time to tumor sampling.
MAF analysis: distribution and median values
RAS MAFs had a median of 0.02 (range 0.0001–0.43) in plasma
and were found in a wide distribution, 48% showed <1%
(MAF <0.01) mutant alleles in their cfDNA (Figure 2A). RAS-ad-
justed MAFs had a median of 0.25 (range 0.03–0.99) in tumor
tissue.
In the group of patients with concordant mutant samples in
ctDNA and tissue by SoC (N ¼ 48), median MAF in plasma was
0.04 (range 0.0001–0.37) (Figure 2B). In the discordant cases
(n ¼ 9) median MAF was 0.0008 (range 0.0004–0.43) (P ¼ 0.069,
Kruskal test).
In concordant samples by BEAMing tested in both tumor and
plasma (N ¼ 48), median adjusted MAF was 0.26 (95% CI 0.04–
0.99) in tumor and 0.14 (95% CI 0.05–0.99) (P ¼ 0.16, Kruskal
test) in discordant samples (N ¼ 7). Overall, there was a tendency
for lower MAFs both in tumor and plasma for the samples with
discordant results.
The median MAF in ctDNA was also described according to
prior chemotherapy exposure and number of metastatic sites. In
the first case, median MAF was 0.07 (95% CI 0.002–0.16) and
0.04 (95% CI 0.006–0.15) in those with no prior therapy and
those exposed, respectively (P ¼ 0.69, Kruskal test). In the second
case, median MAF was 0.05 (95% CI 0.002–0.13) in those with
one or two metastatic sites and 0.15 (95% CI 0.009–0.18) in those
with three or more (P ¼ 0.24, Kruskal test).
Correlation of MAF in concordant mutant samples
in plasma and tissue
We carried out a RAS-adjusted MAF correlation analysis with
BEAMing carried out in tumor and ctDNA in the same patient
according to prior systemic therapy exposure or number of meta-
static sites (Figure 2C and D). Mutational load showed very high
heterogeneity and poor correlation, with a Pearson correlation

�0.21 to 0.39, P ¼ 0.54).
RAS status and correlation with anti-EGFR treat-
ment benefit
The predictive value of RAS WT status from plasma and tumor
determination was analyzed in the subset of patients who
received anti-EGFR plus the irinotecan backbone in second- or
third-line therapy (N ¼ 52). RAS WT patients detected by SoC
(N ¼ 50) had a median PFS of 8.9 months (95% CI 6.8–11.3).
RAS WT patients detected by ctDNA (N ¼ 47) showed a median
PFS of 8.7 months (95% CI 6.8–11.3) (Figure 3A).
Potential impact in OS
We describe outcomes for OS according to RAS MAF detection
by ctDNA (Figure 3B). In the group of patients with RAS mutant
samples with MAF < 0.1 by ctDNA (N ¼ 40), median OS was
27.8 months (95% CI 24.9–47.2), with an HR of 1.60 (95% CI
0.95–2.73; P ¼ 0.08) when compared with RAS WT population.
In the group with MAF �0.1 (n ¼ 16) median OS was
16.4 months (95% CI 11.4–not reached), and the HR for this
group was 2.87 (95% CI 1.46–5.67, P ¼ 0.002) when compared
with RAS WT population.
Relevant parameters were included in a multivariable Cox pro-
portional hazards model on the entire cohort: mutation status
and MAF in two ranges by ctDNA, tumor location and number
of metastatic sites. RAS mutation with MAF �0.1 by ctDNA was
shown to be a significant prognostic factor with a HR of 2.47
(95% CI 1.2–5.0, P ¼ 0.01) (supplementary Table S7, available at
Annals of Oncology online).
Discussion
This is the first clinical series showing the usefulness of detecting
RAS point mutations by ctDNA in the largest cohort of patients
published so far and carried out locally in a general hospital. Our
data revealed a very high overall concordance, close to 90% com-
pared with gold standard tumor tissue analysis techniques. This
result is in accordance with previous reports, where RAS muta-
tion detection in cfDNA has been directly compared with tumor
tissue in CRC cohorts [4–6]. Siravegna et al. [7] focused on clonal
evolution and resistance to EGFR blockade, also described excel-
lent concordance in matched tissue and plasma samples using

 droplet digital PCR (N ¼ 100). Our results prove the feasibility
for implementing this technique in the day-by-day care.
The detailed description of discordant samples reflected in
Table 2 confirms the complexity of RAS genotyping in both
tumor tissue and plasma samples. Translation of these new tech-
nologies to clinical practice reveal not only the technical limita-
tions, but also bring to light conflicting data that provide
information about the biological behavior of each tumor. Tumor
tissue genotyping has inherent limitations the genomic profiles of
primary tumors and metastases are not always concordant owing
to the intrinsic molecular tumor heterogeneity [10, 11]. Likewise,
several reports have shown differences ranging 3%–20% between
different techniques to detect RAS mutations in tissue [12–14].
When analyzing tumor tissue by SoC and BEAMing analysis we
detected a 9.1% rate of discordance, mostly justified by differ-
ences in sensitivity cut-off.
To account for spatial and temporal changes, the genomic pro-
files of CRC patients should be evaluated repeatedly during the
course of therapy and liquid biopsies could play a role for deter-
minations that are more representative of the specific molecular
scenario of a patient at the time of anti-EGFR therapy selection
[7, 15]. The possibility of RAS testing at the time of decision-
making is one of the strongest points arguing in favor of this min-
imally invasive technique.
Furthermore, we consider several issues regarding RAS geno-
typing in plasma need to be highlighted. In our cohort, six pa-
tients had mutations in tissue that could not be detected in
plasma. Lack of RAS mutations in plasma may be attributed to
biological factors that impact ctDNA release and is an important
matter that should be investigated. False negative results repre-
sent a major issue for RAS mutation testing on plasma because of
the possible negative interaction of anti-EGFR agents with
oxaliplatin-based regimens in RAS mutant patients.
Commonly used chemotherapeutic agents as well as targeted
drugs can alter the molecular landscape in these tumors. It is
widely acknowledged that acquired KRAS mutations are associ-
ated with secondary resistance to EGFR blockade [15, 16].
However, the effect on the molecular profile derived from other
therapies such as anti-angiogenics or cytostatic agents before
anti-EGFR administration is yet to be determined [17, 18].
Patients 6 and 9 (Table 2) may be such cases.
Tie et al. [19] reported changes in ctDNA for mCRC patients
during the course of the chemotherapy, with significant reduc-
tions in ctDNA levels (median 5.7-fold) observed before cycle 2
in 41 of the 48 patients with concordant mutant samples in
ctDNA and tissue by SoC. This could impact RAS status deter-
mination in patients exposed to therapy, we hypothesize that this
could be the case for three patients in our cohort (ID 12–14 in
Table 2), although we could not associate this with a homoge-
neous pattern of response. Taking this a step further, we detected
a lower median MAF in the group of patients exposed to prior
therapy.
If ultimately we move towards routine RAS determination in
plasma in clinical practice, there will likely be subgroups of pa-
tients in whom we should continue to perform determinations in
tissue for possible alterations in ctDNA release after a negative li-
quid biopsy.
Although the cohort size of patients with mutations (N ¼ 48)
in our study is a somewhat limiting factor, we nonetheless could
draw interesting conclusions from analyzing MAF, providing to
our knowledge, the first published data in this field. When con-
sidering MAF distribution, a high proportion of patients showed
mutant alleles in cfDNA between 0.0001 (0.01%) and 0.01 (1%).
This highlights the importance of using an extremely sensitive
technique when analyzing plasma samples and must be con-
sidered at the time of analysis to translate this into clinical prac-
tice. Interestingly, there is a tendency for lower MAFs both in
tumor tissue and plasma for samples with discordant results, sug-
gesting that sensitivity for mutation detection in tumor tissue is a
real issue that needs to be addressed. We found no correlation of
RAS MAF with BEAMing carried out in tumor and ctDNA, re-
gardless of prior systemic therapies. The concept of a cut-off for
plasma samples similar to that applied in tissue is complex and in
our interpretation should not be equivalent.
Finally, in an exploratory analysis, and as an indirect way of
confirming the possibility of selecting patients for anti-EGFR
therapy with plasma, a PFS analysis was carried out in the most
homogeneous group of our cohort, showing no relevant differ-
ences between detection methods. To our knowledge no other
concordance studies have reported this, and this type of analysis
is relevant to the implementation of liquid biopsies in clinical
practice.
We can conclude that ctDNA analysis in plasma can detect
RAS mutations to an equivalent level as SoC techniques in tissue,
and thus detecting potential mCRC patients who could benefit
from anti-EGFR therapies.
