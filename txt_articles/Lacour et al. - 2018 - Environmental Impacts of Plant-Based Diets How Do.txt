Background: Studies investigating diet-related environmental impacts have rarely 
considered the production method of the foods consumed. The objective of the present 
study, based on the NutriNet-Santé cohort, was to investigate the relationship between a 
provegetarian score and diet-related environmental impacts. We also evaluated potential 
effect modifications on the association between a provegetarian score and the environ-
mental impacts of organic food consumption.
Methods: Food intake and organic food consumption ratios were obtained from 34,442 
French adults using a food frequency questionnaire, which included information on 
organic food consumption for each group. To characterize the overall structure of the 
diets, a provegetarian score was used to identify preferences for plant-based products 
as opposed to animal-based products. Moreover, three environmental indicators were 
used to assess diet-related environmental impacts: greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, 
cumulative energy demand (CED), and land occupation. Environmental impacts were 
assessed using production life cycle assessment (LCA) at the farm level. Associations 
between provegetarian score quintiles, the level of organic food consumption, and envi-
ronmental indicators were analyzed using ANCOVAs adjusted for energy, sex, and age.
results: Participants with diets rich in plant-based foods (fifth quintile) were more likely 
to be older urban dwellers, to hold a higher degree in education, and to be characterized 
by an overall healthier lifestyle and diet. A higher provegetarian score was associated 
with lower environmental impacts (GHG emissionsQ5vsQ1 = 838/1,664 kg CO2eq/year,

According to the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO), 
adopting sustainable diets at a global level is urgently needed 
(1). Sustainable diets should include a large share of ecologically 
based, local and minimally processed products and limited con-
sumption of animal products. Sustainable diets are also healthy 
in terms of both nutrition and sanitary quality (1). Regarding 
the environmental aspects of a sustainable diet, a shift from 
current dietary patterns toward more environmentally friendly 
habits appears necessary. Environmentally friendly habits include 
reducing the consumption of animal products and increasing the 
consumption of plant products (2). Indeed, livestock is consid-
ered to be responsible for 18% of the greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions from anthropogenic sources at the global level, and this 
pattern is comparable at the country level in France (3). More 
specifically, beef and milk production represent 41 and 20% of 
the emissions from livestock, respectively (3). Livestock requires 
substantial energy for multiple activities such as the production 
of feed, breeding activities, production and spread of fertilizers, 
electricity use, and operating costs of farm buildings (4). Intensive 
livestock production is also responsible for a large part of the loss 
in biodiversity due to important land use for grass and feed crops 
(5). Conversely, extensive livestock farming is suggested to have 
positive effects on biodiversity. Studies investigating these issues 
have consistently reported that decreasing the consumption of 
animal products would have a considerable beneficial impact on 
the environment (6, 7).
The FAO also mentions that alternative modes of produc-
tion may be important to the promotion and development of 
sustainable diets. Organic agriculture is defined as a system that 
relies on ecosystem services rather than external agricultural 
inputs (8). It is generally considered a more environmentally 
friendly production model that enhances the quality of soil 
leading to higher plant and fauna diversity and lower nitrate 
leaching. Nevertheless, disparities in agro-ecological practices 
still remain (9–12). The sustainability of organic food systems 
and their ability to feed the global population have often been 
questioned mostly due to their usually lower crop yields (13, 
14). It is now largely recognized that organic production 
requires less energy inputs than conventional systems (15–17), 
although benefits in terms of GHG reduction are not straight-
forward (18). Moreover, firm conclusions about conventional 
and organic systems are moderated by the functional unit 
(18–20).
Despite ample literature on environmentally sustainable diets, 
few studies have considered both dietary patterns and produc-
tion modes. It is, therefore, of interest to study both parameters 
simultaneously to be able to estimate the extent to which organic 
food consumption affects diet-related environmental impacts. 
It is of considerable interest to consider both plant-based and 
organic foods, which are consumed by vegetarians in Western 
countries (21).
A review of Aleksandrowicz et al. revealed that the change 
from a traditional western diet to alternative dietary patterns 
(e.g., Mediterranean, vegetarian, or vegan) normally provides 
benefits for both individual health and the environment (22). 
The reductions in environmental footprints should generally be 
proportional to the magnitude of the restriction of animal-based 
products (22). Despite lower environmental impacts when com-
pared to omnivorous diets (23), vegan or vegetarian diets are still 
not culturally accepted, particularly in France, where meat-based 
meals and cheese are an integral part of the traditional diet (24). 
In this context, the provegetarian score (25), which characterizes 
diets by the level of plant and animal product consumption, and 
not directly by animal product exclusion, is highly relevant in the 
French environment.
Thus, the first objective of this study is to estimate diet-
related environmental effects according to the provegetarian 
score. Second, we focused on studying the moderating effects of 
organic food consumption according to the level of plant-based 
food consumption. Data are based on a large sample from the 
NutriNet-Santé study within the framework of the BioNutriNet 
project, which enabled us to collect food consumption data and 
environmental data on both organic and conventional products.

study Population
The subjects are adult volunteer participants from the prospec-
tive NutriNet-Santé cohort, which was launched in May 2009 in 
France. The NutriNet-Santé study has been previously described 
in detail in another study (26). At inclusion in the cohort and 
yearly thereafter, the participants completed three 24-h ran-
domly distributed accounts that were provided over a period of 
15 days. They were also asked to complete a set of questionnaires 
about their sociodemographics, anthropometrics, health status, 
and lifestyle characteristics. Participants were also regularly 
invited to complete complementary questionnaires. In 2014, 
participants were asked to provide information on their organic 
occupationQ5vsQ1 = 2,420/4,138 m2/year, −41.5%, P < 0.0001). Organic food consump-
tion was also an important modulator of the relationship between provegetarian dietary 
patterns and environmental impacts but only among participants with diets rich in plant-
based products.
conclusion: Future field studies should endeavor to integrate all the components of a 
sustainable diet, i.e., both diet composition and production methods.

food consumption as well as their motives and attitudes toward 
organic foods.
Data collection
Sociodemographic and Lifestyle Characteristics
The yearly updated inclusion questionnaire provided data on 
sociodemographic characteristics including age, sex, highest 
achieved degree (lower than high school, high school, or post-
secondary graduate), location (rural community, urban unit with 
a population smaller than 20,000 inhabitants, between 20,000 
and 200,000 inhabitants, or higher than 200,000 inhabitants), 
and monthly income per household unit (lower than 900 euros, 
between 900 and 1,200 euros, between 1,200 and 1,800 euros, 
between 1,800 and 2,700 euros, and higher than 2,700 euros). The 
monthly income per household unit was obtained by dividing 
monthly income by consumption units (CU); the first adult in the 
household represents 1 CU, other persons older than 14 represent 
0.5 CU, and other persons younger than 14 years represent 0.3 
CU (27).
This set of data also provided lifestyle characteristics such as 
physical activity (measured by the IPAQ–International Physical 
Activity Questionnaire) (28–30), smoking status (never, former, 
and current smoker), and alcohol intake (never, moderate, or 
frequent drinker). Moderate alcohol consumption was defined 
as an intake lower than 20 g/day for women and lower than 30 g/
day for men (31).
Dietary Data and Organic Food Consumption
Between June and December 2014, participants were asked to 
complete an optional organic food semi-quantitative frequency 
questionnaire (Org-FFQ) based on the original validated 
Nutrinet FFQ (32). The Org-FFQ collected information on con-
sumption frequencies (yearly, monthly, weekly, and daily units) 
and portion sizes for 264 food and beverage items over a year. The 
total food intake was estimated by multiplying the consumption 
frequency and portion size for each item. To estimate the share 
of organic food consumption in the diet, for each item in the 
Org-FFQ, participants indicated how often they consumed that 
item in an organic form. Organic food frequency was assessed 
using a 5-point ordinal scale, “never,” “rarely,” “half of the time,” 
“often,” and “always,” which were weighted as 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 
and 1, respectively, and yielded an estimate of the proportion of 
organic food consumed in an individual diet. The contribution of 
organic food consumption to the diet was calculated by dividing 
the total organic food intake (g/day) by the total food intake (g/
day) excluding water. This ratio was multiplied by 100 to obtain 
the contribution of organic food as a percentage of weight.
The development of the Org-FFQ and sensitivity analyses 
for the allocation of arbitrary weightings has been described in 
another study (21).
The NutriNet-Santé food composition database (33) was 
used to estimate daily nutrient intake independently of the 
production method. To assess the nutritional quality of dietary 
patterns, two indicators were assessed at the individual level: the 
PANDiet (based on the probability of adequate nutrient intake 
for 24 nutrients) (34) and the mPNNS-GS (modified French 
national nutrition and health programme (Programme National 
Nutrition Santé), with the PNNS-guidelines score based on the 
adherence to the PNNS recommendations excluding physical 
activity) (35).
Environmental Data
The methodology for the environmental evaluation of indi-
vidual diets is described in detail in the Presentation S1 in 
Supplementary Material. Data were collected via the French 
diagnostic tool DIALECTE (36) using the life cycle assessment 
method (LCA) (37, 38) at the farm level (from agricultural inputs 
and animal feed production to harvest). To date, DIALECTE is 
the only French database that covers such a large panel of data for 
both organic and conventional agricultural products. This study 
considers the three environmental indicators available: (1) GHG 
emissions were estimated including carbon dioxide, methane 
and nitrous oxide emissions and were expressed in kilogram CO2 
equivalent per day. (2) The cumulative energy demand (CED) 
indicator was defined as the consumption of renewable and 
unrenewable energy in megajoules per day according to the CED 
method (39). (3) Finally, land occupation was defined as the area 
in square meters needed per day. The environmental database 
includes information on 62 raw agricultural products based on 
measurements from 2,086 farms in France and on 30 raw agricul-
tural products based on information from the literature. Among 
these farms, 46% follow certified organic agricultural practices 
(as defined by European regulations).
For each participant, organic and conventional food consump-
tion was multiplied by the environmental impact of each product 
to estimate the impact of the overall diet for each participant.
construction of the Provegetarian score
The provegetarian score was developed to reflect the proportion 
of plant-based food consumed in a diet (25). Components of the 
provegetarian score include seven vegetable food groups and five 
animal food groups (25) (Table S1 in Supplementary Material). 
Sex-specific adjustment for total energy intake was made for 
the consumption of each food group using the residual method 
(40). Energy-adjusted, sex-specific quintile values for each plant 
component were calculated by allocating 1 to 5 points. For animal 
food groups, the quintile values were reversed (from 5 for the first 
quintile to 1 for the fifth quintile). Finally, the provegetarian score 
was obtained by summing the quintile value of each vegetable 
food group and the reverse quintile value of each animal food 
group. The score ranges from 12 (low consumption of plant food) 
to 60 (high consumption of plant food).
Data Treatment and statistical analysis
Among the 37,685 participants who completed the Org-FFQ, 
participants with missing sociodemographic data or aberrant 
data were excluded (N = 1,390). To detect under reporting and 
over reporting, energy requirements were calculated for each 
individual using physical activity level (IPAQ) and basal metabolic 
rate, estimated by Schofield’s equation (41) and taking into account 
age, sex, and BMI. The ratio of energy intake to energy require-
ment was calculated, and participants with a ratio below 0.35 or 
above 1.93 were excluded (N = 1,099). Finally, only participants 
living in mainland France and having complete data to calculate

the nutritional quality scores were included. The final sample 
included 34,442 participants, with 22,813 women and 7,569 men.
Sociodemographic and lifestyle characteristics along with 
food and nutrient intakes were presented across the provegetar-
ian score quintiles. For descriptive purposes, nutrient and food 
data were adjusted for total energy intake by sex using the residual 
method (40). Means, SDs and percentages were provided as 
appropriate. P values referred to the Mantel–Haenzel chi-square 
trend test for categorical variables and to the linear contrast test 
(ANCOVA) for continuous variables.
The contributions (as percentages) of different food groups to 
diet-related GHG emissions and CED across provegetarian score 
quintiles are presented. All P-trends were obtained with linear 
contrast tests (ANCOVA).
As an interaction between the provegetarian score and 
organic food consumption was observed (P ≤ 0.0001), data were 
stratified by the level of organic food consumption. Associations 
between the provegetarian score and environmental impacts for 
the overall sample and the stratified tertiles of the contribution 
of organic consumption to the whole diet were estimated using 
ANCOVA adjusted with Dunett’s test. All models were adjusted 
for sex, age, and energy intake. In addition, the ratio of organic 
food consumption as a continuous variable was included in the 
stratified analyses to account for residual confounding. The ordi-
nal margins option was used. In all the analyses, the environmen-
tal indicators were log-transformed to improve the normality of 
the distributions. The data are presented as adjusted means with 
their 95% confidence intervals. Unadjusted models are provided 
in the Table S2 in Supplementary Material. Two-sided tests and a 
P-value <0.05 were used for statistical significance.
All analyses were performed using SAS software (SAS Institute 
Inc., Cary, NC, USA).
resUlTs
individual characteristics
Table 1 presents sociodemographic and lifestyle characteristics 
of the participants across provegetarian score quintiles. No dif-
ference in the sex distribution of participants across the quintiles 
was observed. Participants with higher provegetarian scores were 
more likely to be highly educated, physically active, non-smokers, 
and moderate or non-drinkers. The Q5 of the provegetarian score 
(reflecting high consumption of plant food) included the highest 
proportion of participants with the lowest monthly income per 
household unit (<900 euros), while Q4 included the highest 
proportion of participants with the highest monthly income 
(>2,700 euros). The highest proportion of participants living in 
population-dense urban units was found in the Q4. Finally, the 
largest share of vegetarians was included in the Q5 of the proveg-
etarian diet (8.3% in Q5 versus 0.2% in Q1).
Food and nutrients intake by 
Provegetarian score Quintile
Tables 2 and 3 present food groups and nutrient intake across 
provegetarian score quintiles. By construction, the consumption 
of animal-based products decreased while the consumption of 
plant-based products increased across quintiles. Participants in 
the highest quintile also consumed less fast food products (ham-
burgers, pizzas, and sandwiches), sweets, and alcohol and had a 
higher intake of salad dressings, popcorn, or nuts. Overall, con-
sidering nutrient intake, a higher provegetarian score was associ-
ated with a lower overall protein intake but a higher proportion 
of plant protein (50.5% in Q5 versus 22.2% in Q1) and a higher 
polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) and monounsaturated fatty 
acid (MUFA) intake as well as a lower saturated fatty acid intake 
and higher n-6/n-3 PUFA ratio. The intake of carbohydrates and 
fiber increased across provegetarian score quintiles. Participants 
in the Q5 of the provegetarian score also displayed the highest 
level of organic food consumption, as organic food represented a 
50% share of their total food consumption.
Considering vitamins and minerals, iron intake increased 
across the quintiles of the provegetarian score while haem iron 
decreased. As expected, participants in the Q5 of the provegetar-
ian score also exhibited a higher intake of most micronutrients 
(β-carotene, B1, B6, B9, C, E, K vitamins, and minerals Mg, K, and 
Mn). According to both the mPNNS-GS and PANDiet scores, 
participants in the last quintile showed the highest adherence to 
the French dietary guidelines.
environmental impacts by Provegetarian 
score Quintile
After the adjustment for energy intake, age, and sex, diet-related 
GHG emissions, CED, and land occupation decreased across 
the provegetarian score quintiles by −49.6, −26.9, and −41.5%, 
respectively, between Q5 and Q1 (Table 4). For all indicators, a 
linear association was observed (P < 0.0001). This reflects that 
the richer a diet is in plant products, the lower the environmental 
impacts are. For informational purposes, crude means and SDs of 
environmental indicators across the quintiles of the provegetar-
ian score are presented in Figure S1 in Supplementary Material.
contribution of Food groups to Diet-
related ghg emissions, ceD, and land 
Occupation by Provegetarian score 
Quintile
Figure 1 indicates that the main contributor to diet-related GHG 
emissions across the different provegetarian score categories was 
animal-based products, particularly ruminant meat consump-
tion. Animal products were responsible for approximately 
80% of the dietary GHG emissions for diets rich in animal 
products (Q1 of the provegetarian score), between 70 and 80% 
for diets moderate in animal products and approximately 60% 
for diets rich in plant products (Q5 of the provegetarian score). 
Specifically, ruminant meat represented approximately half of 
the diet-related GHG emissions, regardless of the type of diet 
considered.
Concerning the CED (Figure 2), consumption of fruits, and 
vegetables was the major contributor (except for Q1 and Q2). 
Estimates of the contribution of monogastric meat and ruminant 
meat to diet-related CED were similar.
Finally, Figure 3 presents land occupation by food group and 
by quintile. The results were closer than those for GHG emissions,

showing a high contribution of animal products specifically 
ruminant meat to land occupation.
Moreover, the contribution of carbohydrates and oil to GHG 
emissions and CED increased across the provegetarian score 
quintiles. Of note, the contribution from cheese consumption was 
more important than from the contribution from dairy products 
and milk across quintiles.
Diet-related environmental impacts 
considering both the Provegetarian score 
and the level of Organic Food 
consumption
Table 4 presents the association between the provegetarian score 
and the environmental impacts stratified by the level of organic 
food consumption. Similar linear trends were observed between 
the provegetarian score and environmental impacts across 
the different levels of organic food consumption. Considering 
diet-related environmental impacts in diets that contained low 
or moderate (Q1, Q2, and Q3) amounts of plant products (i.e., 
≥70% animal protein for protein intake and ≥45% animal lipid 
for lipid intake), the level of organic food consumption did not 
significantly modify the association between the provegetarian 
score and the environmental impacts (GHG: PQ2vsQ1 = 0.97 and 
PQ3vsQ1 = 0.28; CED: PQ2vsQ1 = 0.94 and PQ3vsQ1 = 0.10; land occupa-
tion PQ2vsQ1 = 0.78 and PQ3vsQ1 = 0.97). However, for diets rich in 
plant foods (Q4 and Q5), the differences in the environmental 
impacts across the provegetarian score quintiles increased across 
the organic food ratio tertiles (P < 0.0001 except for land occupa-
tion PQ4vsQ1 = 0.01).

DiscUssiOn
In our study, participants with a high provegetarian score were 
characterized by an overall healthier lifestyle, including healthier 
diets, as reflected by higher PANDiet and mPNNS-GS scores. 
Diets rich in plant products displayed lower environmental 
impacts (GHG emissions, CED and land occupation). Moreover, 
the consumption level of organic products was shown to have a 
positive moderating effect on diet-related environmental impacts 
only in diets rich in plant-based food.
Overall, a higher provegetarian score was associated with lower 
environmental impacts, particularly GHG emissions, across all 
levels of organic food consumption. These results at the individual 
diet level were expected since livestock is the most substantial 
agricultural contributor to GHG emissions, demands high energy 
inputs, and requires important land resources (42–44).
Similar results for GHG emissions were documented in the 
EPIC-Oxford observational study. However, the estimations were 
not adjusted for energy intake, and the LCA did not consider the 
production mode even though it included all stages of produc-
tion, transformation, and distribution. The authors showed that 
a diet rich in animal products emitted 2.5 times as much GHG 
than a vegan diet. For women and men, GHG emissions from 
the diets of meat-eaters were 46 and 51% higher, respectively, 
than those of fish-eaters (or pesco-vegetarians), and 50 and 54% 
higher, respectively, than those of vegetarians (45). Other studies

documented similar trends in regards to environmental impacts 
of modeled substitutions for meat (46–48). For instance, the mod-
eled substitution in the EPIC-Netherlands cohort demonstrated 
that substituting meat with 35 g/d of different combinations of 
plant products including potatoes, pasta, vegetables, nuts, and 
milky desserts could reduce GHG emissions up to 12% (49). In a 
recent review, authors concluded that the isocaloric substitution 
of meat by starchy food, fruits, nuts, and vegetables was more 
sustainable in terms of GHG emissions. However, in that same 
review, production modes (more or less agro-ecological modes) 
were not distinguished (43).
Livestock results in GHG emissions such as nitrous oxide, 
carbon dioxide, and methane due to high-energy feed production, 
concentrating production and enteric fermentation of ruminants 
(3). However, impacts related to ruminant meat are higher when 
compared to monogastric animals because of methane emissions 
and the need for substantial livestock feed production needed (43, 
50, 51). As consumers in the Q5 of the provegetarian score ate less 
meat, especially ruminant meat, compared to participants in the 
other quintiles, the difference in GHG emissions is further increased. 
A previous study showed that a diet in which ruminant meat is 
replaced by monogastric meat (pork or poultry) reduced GHG 
emissions from 20 to 35% and land-use impacts from 30 to 50% (50).
In another study, the CED was computed at the farm level 
using the LCA method, and it was shown that a 60% decrease 
in daily meat consumption that is replaced by planted-based 
products led to an up to 38% decrease in CED, according to 
various scenarios of self-sufficiency in Austria (48). The review 
by Perignon et al., which covers 10 cohort studies on the environ-
mental impact of observed individual diets, demonstrates that 
low-meat diets are more environmentally friendly (43).
Livestock farming requires a substantial input of fossil energy 
due to farm facilities and production of feed (3). Moreover, plant 
products have higher energy efficiency when considering the ratio 
of outputs/inputs for each calorie (52). Regarding the CED by 
food group and by quintile, there is no clear difference in the CED 
contribution between ruminant meat and monogastric meat. 
Considering the level of consumption, food group contribution 
to CED is probably driven more by the difference in intake than 
energy use for the different types of meat since the differences 
they are less noticeable than for GHG emissions (53).
Finally, similar results on land use were found when the aver-
age Danish diet was replaced by the new Nordic diet containing 
35% less meat with a 24% decrease in diet-related land use. In 
the model performed for the EPIC-Netherlands cohort, the 
substitution of meat with 35 g/d of plant products led to an up to 
12% decrease in land use (49). Moreover, the review of Hallström 
et al., which included 14 original studies (mainly based on 
modeling methods), showed that vegan diets reduced land use 
up to 60 and 50% for men and women, respectively (50). In fact, 
livestock farming is the largest user of land due to the total area 
need for grazing and feed crop production (5).

It is worth noting that beyond the benefits to the environment, 
diets rich in plant products also provide important nutritional 
and health benefits (54, 55).
We showed that introducing organic food to one’s diet had a 
significant positive environmental effect on GHG emissions in 
only diets rich in plant products. However, when considering a 
diet with a moderate amount of plant products, this effect was 
not substantial.
The weak moderating effect of the organic consumption in a 
diet with a moderate amount of plant products can be explained 
by several hypotheses. First, no difference in GHG emissions was 
reported for both conventional and organic beef and milk produc-
tion systems (20). In addition, GHG emissions from chicken and 
pork organic farming practices are higher because feed produc-
tion is more substantial due to a longer cycle of production and a 
lower growth rate (in relation to a lower feed-efficiency conver-
sion) (20). Moreover, GHG emissions from organic pork farming 
practices can be higher because of the high level of nitrous oxide 
emissions from straw litter (19). However, the differences between 
chicken and pork production systems have not yet been consist-
ently measured, and further research is needed to improve the 
reliability of calculating GHG emissions for different farming 
practices. Second, organic farming results in lower GHG emissions 
when emissions are expressed by units of area, and no clear trends 
emerge when they are expressed by units of product weight (18). 
Finally, organic practices have obvious beneficial effects on GHG 
emissions in terms of plant production because of the exclusion 
of synthetic fertilizers that result in high N2O and CO2 emissions 
(19, 56). Finally, the proportion of organic food consumption in 
the diet may be too low in the first provegetarian score quintiles 
to detect differences in GHG emissions. Considering the CED 
indicator, the ratio of organic food in the diet positively affects 
diet-related environmental impacts with increasing effects across 
provegetarian score quintiles. Organic practices prohibit the use

of synthetic fertilizers which induce high costs in energy for their 
production and require the use of less mineral fertilizers and feed 
concentrates (56). However, some studies have determined that 
CED can be up to 40% higher in organic farming than in conven-
tional systems (19). Another explanation relies on the fact that 
among the high consumers of organic foods, plant-based food 
consumption was higher overall. However, the correlation coef-
ficient between the provegetarian score and the level of organic 
food consumption was estimated to be 0.4.
Regarding land occupation, the level of organic food consump-
tion had a positive impact on diets rich in plant products and had 
no impact on diets with moderate level of plant product intake. 
These findings are noteworthy since organic systems require 
relatively more land (20, 56, 57) than conventional production 
systems. These lower crop yields are due to lower total nitrogen 
inputs per hectare (20). Our results may be explained by the fact 
that in the Q5 of the provegetarian score, consumers that eat a 
substantial amount of organic food exhibited higher plant-based 
consumption than their conventional counterparts and thus 
may have exhibited a lower consumption of meat. Moreover, 
according to Pimentel and Pimentel, grains and some legumes, 
which were highly consumed by participants in the Q5 of the 
provegetarian score, are produced more efficiently than fruits and 
vegetables (42). This may have led to a reduction in the negative 
impact of organic production on plant production yields. The 
absence of a differential effect of organic food consumption on 
land use for a diet with a moderate amount of plant products 
may be related to the fact that the ratio of organic foods in the 
diet is too low to detect any association, which is the same for 
GHG emissions. These findings regarding land occupation need 
further investigation since future improvements of management 
techniques and crop varieties may reduce the difference in crop 
yields between organic and conventional systems (9). Although 
this was not evaluated in our study, organic systems generally offer 
environmental services, do not use pesticides, increase resilience 
of agriculture and can mitigate the future effects of climate change 
on yields (58).
The limitations of this study should be noted. An extrapo-
lation of these results to the general population should be 
done with caution as the participants who completed the 
BioNutriNet questionnaires were probably more concerned 
with nutrition and health-related issues. It should be noted that 
the percentage of participants with a very high consumption of 
organic foods, as observed in our study, is likely to be minimal 
in France. The use of a food frequency questionnaire may be 
prone to incorrectly estimating habitual diets, which is similar 
to other self-reported food consumption tools (59). Moreover, 
the effects of the systems of production on the environment 
should be considered with caution. Indeed, among similar 
systems of production, effects can be largely different due to 
climate conditions, soil types and farm management (18, 56). 
Other indicators such as pesticide use, leaching, and soil qual-
ity would have been relevant to addressing the environmental 
impacts of production systems (60, 61). In addition, our data 
included neither the origin nor the seasonality of food products, 
which may impact environmental assessments. Furthermore,

environmental impacts were assessed at the farm level and did 
not consider all of the production, transformation and distribu-
tion stages.
However, our study also presents notable strengths. First, to 
the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to distinguish 
production modes in the assessment of food consumption 
 11

and several subsequent environmental impacts. This is also 
the first study to investigate moderating effects of organic 
food consumption on the environmental impact of observed 
diets. Modeling studies do not necessarily consider isocaloric 
or representative substitutions. For example, replacing meat 
with fruit and legumes may not appear entirely realistic. Meat 
would probably be replaced by energy-dense products such 
as cereals, potatoes, and legumes. Moreover, these modeling 
studies rely on small cohorts. Therefore, it was crucial to focus 
on actual diets assessed in a large cohort to confirm or refute 
the results from modeling studies. Concerning the strengths of 
this study, our study is based on a large sample, which allows a 
wide diversity of dietary behaviors to be considered and in par-
ticular eco-friendly behaviors, using accurate environmental 
and consumption data. The provegetarian score also presents 
several advantages when compared to other dietary indexes 
commonly used in the literature such as the Mediterranean diet 
score (62). Indeed, while the Mediterranean diet recommends 
limiting milk and red meat, it also recommends consuming 
fish even though a major part of the fishing industry is not 
sustainable (63) and degrades maritime ecosystem functions 
by altering the food chain and fish habitats (64). Finally, the 
provegetarian score reflects different emerging dietary patterns 
(e.g., flexitarian diets) that tend to reduce consumption of 
animal products.
In conclusion, diet-related GHG emissions, CED, and land 
occupation indicators are negatively associated with a plant-
based diet, regardless of the level of organic food consumption. 
Furthermore, the consumption of organic food showed additional 
beneficial impacts only in diets rich in plant products. This study 
demonstrates that the environmental impacts of diets should not 
only be evaluated in terms of dietary patterns but also should 
integrate production systems.
