Background-—Measures of subclinical atherosclerosis are predictors of future cardiovascular outcomes as well as of physical and
cognitive functioning. The menopausal transition is associated with accelerated progression of atherosclerosis in women. The
prospective association between a healthy lifestyle during the midlife and subclinical atherosclerosis is unclear.
Methods and Results-—Self-reported data on smoking, diet, and physical activity from 1143 women in the Study of Women’s
Health Across the Nation were used to construct a 10-year average Healthy Lifestyle Score (HLS) during the midlife. Markers of
subclinical atherosclerosis were measured 14 years after baseline and included common carotid artery intima-media thickness
(CCA-IMT), adventitial diameter (CCA-AD), and carotid plaque. The associations of average HLS with CCA-IMT and CCA-AD were
estimated using linear models; the association of average HLS with carotid plaque was estimated using cumulative logit models.
Average HLS was associated with smaller CCA-IMT and CCA-AD in the fully adjusted models (P=0.0031 and <0.001, respectively).
Compared with participants in the lowest HLS level, those in the highest level had 0.024 mm smaller CCA-IMT (95% confidence
interval: �0.048, 0.000), which equals 17% of the SD of CCA-IMT, and 0.16 mm smaller CCA-AD (95% confidence interval: �0.27,
�0.04), which equals 24% of the SD of CCA-AD. Among the 3 components of the HLS, abstinence from smoking had the strongest
association with subclinical atherosclerosis.
Conclusions-—Healthy lifestyle during the menopausal transition is associated with less subclinical atherosclerosis, highlighting
the growing recognition that the midlife is a critical window for cardiovascular prevention in women. (J Am Heart Assoc. 2018;7:

C
ardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of
morbidity and mortality in the United States in women as
well as in men.1 Women experience a steeper increase in CVD
risk during and after the menopausal transition relative to
before menopause.1–3 Menopause is also associated with
several adverse changes of cardiovascular risk factors
independently of chronological aging, such as increased
levels of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL)
cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B.4 This suggests that the
midlife may be an especially relevant period for cardiovascular
risk assessment and prevention in women.
Subclinical atherosclerosis is closely related to the onset of
clinically apparent CVD and to CVD mortality. The develop-
ment of subclinical atherosclerosis typically precedes the
occurrence of clinical CVD by years to decades.5 Measures of

 (CCA), such as intima-media thickness (IMT), adventitial
diameter (AD), and carotid plaque, are clinically important
predictors of future CVD events6–8 and are useful in quantifying
CVD risk in asymptomatic individuals without clinically diag-
nosed CVD.6,8,9 In addition to being predictive of clinical
outcomes, measures of subclinical carotid atherosclerosis are
also associated with poorer physical and cognitive functioning
in old age independent of clinical CVD.10–12 The distribution
and determinants of subclinical atherosclerosis differ substan-
tially by age and sex.13 It has been shown previously that the
menopausal transition is associated with accelerated progres-
sion of subclinical carotid atherosclerosis.14,15
Abstinence from smoking, adoption of a healthy diet, and
engagement in regular physical activity are 3 well-known
modifiable behavioral factors that are considered part of a
heart-healthy lifestyle. Prior studies have found inverse
associations between an overall healthy lifestyle and various
CVD outcomes, including coronary heart disease,16 myocar-
dial infarction,17 and CVD-related mortality.18 However, to the
best of our knowledge, no study has examined the prospec-
tive association between the long-term lifestyle in midlife
women and subclinical atherosclerosis. Because of the
association of subclinical atherosclerosis with future clinical
CVD and physical/cognitive functioning, as well as the
accelerated progression of atherosclerosis during the meno-
pausal transition, the potential effect of modifiable health
behaviors on subclinical atherosclerosis in midlife women
warrants further investigation as the midlife may be a critical
window of opportunity for prevention. In fact, a prior study
shows that a lifestyle education program targeting diet and
physical activity might be able to slow the menopause-related
progression of atherosclerosis.14 Therefore, we aimed to use
data from the SWAN (Study of Women’s Health Across the
Nation) to create a composite healthy lifestyle score (HLS)
from 3 behavioral CVD risk factors that are largely modifiable
(smoking, diet quality, and physical activity) and to evaluate
the prospective association between the HLS during the
midlife and measures of subclinical carotid atherosclerosis.
We also aimed to explore the independent association
between each component of the HLS and subclinical carotid
atherosclerosis.
Methods
The data, analytic methods, and study materials will not be
made available to other researchers for purposes of repro-

Study Design and Study Population
The SWAN is an ongoing, multicenter, multiethnic, prospective
cohort study initiated in 1996 to study the natural history of
the menopausal transition. Details of the SWAN protocol have
been described previously.19 Briefly, SWAN participants were
recruited from 7 sites across the United States: (1) Boston,
Massachusetts; (2) Chicago, Illinois; (3) Southeastern Michi-
gan; (4) Los Angeles, California; (5) Newark, New Jersey;
(6) Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; and (7) Oakland, California.
Women who identified themselves as black (Pittsburgh,
Chicago, Detroit, and Boston), Chinese (Oakland), Japanese
(Los Angeles), Hispanic (Newark), or non-Hispanic white (all
sites) were enrolled. Baseline eligibility criteria included the
following: age 42 to 52 years, having an intact uterus and at
least 1 ovary, not being pregnant or lactating, not using oral
contraceptives or hormone therapy in the past 3 months, and
having at least 1 menstrual cycle in the past 3 months. The
initial sample size at baseline was 3302. Clinic assessments
began in 1996 and the participants have been followed up for
15 approximately annual examinations through the most
recent visit in 2015–2016. The SWAN protocols were
approved by the Institutional Review Board at each site, and
all participants provided written informed consent at each
study visit.
Carotid ultrasound scans were conducted at 6 sites
(except the Los Angeles site) at SWAN follow-up Visit 12
(2009–2011) or Visit 13 (2011–2013), with the vast majority
of scans performed at Visit 12. Among the 2806 women
initially enrolled at these 6 sites, 1990 (70.9%) participants
attended Visit 12, of whom 1592 (80.0%) had a carotid scan
at either Visit 12 or Visit 13. Additionally, 14 women did not
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• Women who have a healthy lifestyle, composed of absti-
nence from smoking, healthy diet, and engagement in
regular physical activity, during the menopausal transition
have lower levels of subclinical atherosclerosis later in their
life.
• The prevalence of these healthy behaviors is extremely low
in midlife women.
• Among the 3 components of this healthy lifestyle, absti-
nence from smoking has the strongest association with
subclinical atherosclerosis.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• This work highlights the growing recognition that the midlife
is a critical window for cardiovascular prevention in women.
• Prevention of future cardiovascular disease among women
undergoing the menopausal transition should focus on
modifiable health behaviors including smoking, diet, and
physical activity.

 attend Visit 12, but attended and received their carotid scan
at Visit 13. Thus, a total of 1606 women had a carotid scan at
either Visit 12 or Visit 13. From these 1606 participants, we
further excluded women who lacked data on the 3 specific
measures of carotid atherosclerosis (n=54); who self-reported
having heart disease (n=51) or stroke (n=9) at baseline or who
developed heart disease (n=39) or stroke (n=36) during the
follow-up; who reported too few (<4) or too many (>16)
numbers of solid foods per day (n=110), skipped more than
10 food items on the food frequency questionnaire (n=3) or
reported a total energy intake that was too low (<2092 kJ/
day,
ie,
500 kcal/d)
or
too
high
(>20 920 kJ/d,
ie,
5000 kcal/d) (n=4); who had incomplete data on the 3
components of HLS for all visits (n=21); and who had missing
data for the major covariates (n=136). After these exclusions,
the final analytical sample consisted of 1143 women
(Figure 1); 98% (n=1121) of the retained participants received
their carotid ultrasound scan at Visit 12.
Comparisons of baseline characteristics of women in the
analytic sample (n=1143) with those excluded (n=861)
showed that the excluded participants were significantly
(P<0.05) more likely to be black (42.6% of the excluded
women versus 26.2% of the retained women were black) and
early perimenopausal (48.7% versus 43.7%), and were signif-
icantly more likely to report difficulty paying for basic
necessities (48.0% versus 31.0%) and depressive symptoms
(28.2% versus 21.8%), to have a higher body mass index
(mean: 29.9 kg/m2 versus 27.9 kg/m2), high blood pressure
(37.0% versus 26.2%), impaired fasting glucose (30.3% versus
20.6%), and low HDL cholesterol (41.0% versus 32.6%). At
baseline, the excluded participants were significantly less
likely to have a college degree (39.5% of the excluded women
versus 48.9% of the retained women had a college degree), to
be married or living as if married (58.3% versus 70.3%), and to
self-report having excellent/very good overall health (51.3%
versus 64.5%). Age at baseline, age at the carotid scan,
hormone therapy use during the follow-up, and baseline
proportions of high serum triglycerides, high total cholesterol,
and high LDL cholesterol did not differ significantly between
the retained and the excluded participants.
Assessment of Exposures
In a prior study in SWAN, Sternfeld et al created a HLS using
smoking, physical activity, and diet quality (quantified by a
healthy diet score).20 Building on this prior work, we modified
the HLS by using the well-established Alternate Healthy Eating
Index (AHEI) to quantify diet quality, while keeping the scoring
methods of smoking and physical activity the same as in the
original HLS. The AHEI is an a priori dietary index that
quantifies the adherence of one’s diet to certain dietary
guidelines. The AHEI has repeatedly been shown to be
predictive of the risk of chronic disease and can better
account for the types of fiber, protein, and fats.21–23

 Dietary data were collected at baseline (1996–1997),
Visit 5 (2001–2003), and Visit 9 (2005–2007) using a
modification of the 1995 version of the Block food frequency
questionnaire (FFQ), which has previously been validated
against dietary records24 and 24-hour recalls.25 Briefly,
among women, the deattenuated correlation coefficients (ie,
after removing the random, within-person errors)26 between
the Block FFQ and 24-hour recalls for total energy intake,
protein, carbohydrate, total fat, saturated fat, monounsatu-
rated fat, and polyunsaturated fat were 0.45, 0.53, 0.66,
0.67, 0.65, 0.60, and 0.48, respectively.25 The FFQ used in
SWAN included 103 food items, including 83 solid food
items and 20 beverage food items. The FFQ was adminis-
tered by trained personnel. The participants were asked how
often, on average, they consumed each food of a standard
portion size during the past year. Up to 9 possible responses
were available for each food item: <once/mo or never,
once/mo, 2 to 3 times/mo, once/wk, twice/wk, 3 to
4 times/wk, 5 to 6 times/wk, once/d, and ≥twice/d. We
further transformed the responses into semicontinuous
variables representing servings per day, with values 0.016,
0.03, 0.08, 0.14, 0.28, 0.5, 0.79, 1, and 2 for the 9
responses, respectively. Intake of energy and nutrients was
computed by multiplying the consumption frequency of each
food by the corresponding nutrient content.
For each visit, we calculated the AHEI for each participant.
The AHEI includes 9 components of foods and nutrients intake
(Table S1). The scores of the 9 components were summed to
obtain the total AHEI score, which ranged from 2.5 (worst
diet) to 87.5 (best diet). We further collapsed each partici-
pant’s AHEI score and gave a score of 2 when the
participant’s AHEI score was in the top tertile of the study
population, a score of 1 when the AHEI score was in the
middle tertile, and a score of 0 when the AHEI score was in
the bottom tertile.
Current guidelines recommend that adults should pursue
at least 150 min/wk of moderate-intensity physical activity
for substantial health benefits.27 Physical activity was eval-
uated from the sports and exercise questions on the validated
Kaiser Physical Activity Survey28 to determine whether this
recommendation was met.20 We gave a score of 2 (fully
meeting the recommendation) to those who played sports or
exercised more than once a week, for at least 2 h/wk for at
least 9 months during the past year and with at least a
moderate increase in heart rate and breathing. We gave a
score of 1 (partially meeting the recommendation) to those
who played sports or exercised more than once a month but
no more than once a week, or to those who played sports or
exercised more than once a week but did not satisfy other
criteria to qualify for a score of 2. We gave a score of 0 (not
meeting the recommendation) to those who played sports or
exercised no more than once a month. Data of physical
activity at baseline, Visit 5, and Visit 9 were used (ie, the same
time points as the available dietary data).
Standardized
questions
from
the
American
Thoracic
Association29 were used to collect information on smoking
status. We gave a score of 2 to never smoking, a score of 1 to
former smoking, and a score of 0 to current smoking. Data at
baseline, Visit 5, and Visit 9 were used.
Healthy lifestyle score
To calculate the HLS, we computed the arithmetic sum (ie,
without weighting) of the scores for the individual compo-
nents of smoking, physical activity, and diet quality to create
visit-specific HLS, with a possible range of 0 to 6 for each visit
(baseline, Visit 5, and Visit 9). The visit-specific scores were
then averaged across all nonmissing visits to create the
average HLS. To uncover potential nonlinear associations, we
further divided the average HLS into 4 levels: 0 to 2, >2 to 3,
>3 to 4, and >4 to 6, which approximated the quartiles of the
HLS distribution.
Assessment of Outcomes
The details of the carotid ultrasound measurements have been
described elsewhere.30,31 Briefly, at all SWAN sites except the
Los Angeles site, centrally trained and certified sonographers
obtained carotid ultrasound images at Visit 12 (and Visit 13 for
a small group of participants), using a Terason t3000
Ultrasound System (Teratech Corp, Burlington, MA) equipped
with a variable frequency (5–12 MHz) linear array transducer.
Two digitized images were obtained of each of the left and right
distal CCA. From each of these 4 images, using the AMS
semiautomated edge detection software,32 near and far wall
IMT measures of the CCA were obtained by electronically
tracing the lumen–intima interface and the media–adventitia
interface across a 1-cm segment proximal to the carotid bulb; 1
measurement was generated for each pixel over the area, for a
total of �140 measures for each segment. The average and
maximal values for these measures were recorded for all 4
images, with the mean of the maximal readings of all 4 images
used in the analyses. AD of the CCA was measured as the
distance from the adventitial–medial interface on the near wall
to the medial–adventitial interface on the far wall at end-
diastole across the same CCA segments used for IMT
measurement. The mean value of the average readings was
used in the analyses. Carotid scan images were read centrally
at the SWAN Ultrasound Reading Center (University of
Pittsburgh Ultrasound Research Laboratory). Sonographers at
each site evaluated the presence and extent of plaque in each
of 5 segments of the left and right carotid artery (distal and
proximal CCA, carotid bulb, and proximal internal and external
carotid arteries). A plaque was defined as a distinct area
protruding into the vessel lumen that was at least 50% thicker

 than the adjacent IMT. For each segment, the degree of the
plaque was graded between 0 (no observable plaque) to 3
(plaque obstructing ≥50% of the luminal diameter of the vessel).
The grades from all segments of the combined left and right
carotid artery were summed to create the plaque index.33
Technicians at the 6 study sites were trained by the University
of Pittsburgh Ultrasound Research Laboratory and monitored
during the study period for reliability. Reproducibility of IMT
measures was good to excellent with an intraclass correlation
coefficient between sonographers of ≥0.77, and between
readers of >0.90. The plaque index was similarly reliable with
an intraclass correlation ranging from 0.86 to 0.93.34
The 3 outcomes of this study were the intima-media
thickness of the common carotid artery (CCA-IMT), the
adventitial diameter of the common carotid artery (CCA-AD),
and the extent of carotid plaque (categorized by carotid
plaque index). We treated CCA-IMT and CCA-AD as continu-
ous outcome variables. We collapsed carotid plaque index into
none (0), moderate (1), and high (≥2) and treated it as a
categorical (ordinal) outcome variable.
Assessment of Covariates
Self-reported covariates at baseline included age (continuous),
race/ethnicity (black, Hispanic, Chinese, or non-Hispanic
white), education level (≤ high school, some college, or college
degree/postcollege), financial strain (somewhat/very hard
paying for basics, or not hard paying for basics), marital status
(single/never married, married/living as if married, or sepa-
rated/widowed/divorced), self-rated overall health (excellent/
very
good,
good,
or
fair/poor),
depressive
symptoms
(dichotomized by the Center for Epidemiological Studies
Depression Scale: ≥16 or <16),35 and menopausal status
based
on
self-reported
menstrual
bleeding
patterns
(dichotomized as premenopausal or early perimenopausal).36
Self-reported use of hormone therapy during the follow-up was
dichotomized as ever use or never use, with ever use defined as
use of hormone therapy at any visit from baseline to the visit of
the carotid scan. The presence of hot flash was self-reported at
Visit 12. Weight and height were measured by trained
interviewers using a calibrated balance beam scale and a
stadiometer, respecitvely, and body mass index (BMI) was
calculated as weight in kilograms divided by squared height in
meters. Blood pressure was calculated as the average of 2
seated measurements using a standard mercury sphygmoman-
ometer, and blood samples were taken to measure fasting
glucose, total cholesterol, serum triglycerides, LDL cholesterol,
and HDL cholesterol. Based on harmonized guidelines,37 high
blood pressure was defined as systolic blood pressure
≥130 mm Hg, or diastolic blood pressure ≥85 mm Hg, or use
of at least 1 antihypertensive medication. Impaired fasting
glucose was defined as fasting glucose ≥100 mg/dL or use of
at least 1 antidiabetic medication. High serum triglycerides was
defined as fasting serum triglycerides ≥150 mg/dL. Low serum
HDL cholesterol was defined as serum HDL cholesterol
<50 mg/dL.
Additionally,
we
considered
total
cholesterol
≥200 mg/dL as high total cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol
≥130 mg/dL as high LDL cholesterol.
Statistical Analysis
In the descriptive analysis, we computed the means and SDs
for continuous covariates and percentages for categorical
covariates for the entire study population as well as stratified
by categories of average HLS, adjusting for baseline age. In
the multivariate regression analysis, we estimated the asso-
ciation of the levels of the average HLS (0–2; >2–3; >3–4; and
>4–6) with CCA-IMT and CCA-AD using linear models, and
with carotid plaque (high versus moderate versus none) using
cumulative logit models (ie, ordinal logistic regression models).
No transformations were performed on CCA-IMT or CCA-AD.
Normality and homoscedasticity of the residuals were checked
and satisfied in all linear models. No significant deviation from
the proportional odds assumption was observed (P values for
the score tests >0.05) in the cumulative logit models.38
The selection of confounders was based on a priori
knowledge of risk factors for subclinical atherosclerosis
gained from the literature and supplemented by the empirical
exposure-covariate associations in the study population. We
adjusted for baseline covariates, age at the carotid scan, use
of hormone therapy from baseline to the visit of the carotid
scan, self-reported hot flash at Visit 12, and the number of
missing visits for the HLS. The baseline covariates included
race/ethnicity, education level, financial strain, marital status,
self-rated overall health, depressive symptoms, total energy
intake, and menopausal status. Physiological risk factors,
including BMI, high blood pressure, impaired fasting glucose,
serum triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL
cholesterol, use of antilipidemic medications, and use of
antihypertensive medications might be both confounders and
potential mediators. Therefore, the values of these covariates
were additionally adjusted for in separate models. P values
were computed by using the HLS as a continuous variable in
the models. We further explored the association of each
component of the HLS (ie, smoking, diet, and physical activity)
with subclinical carotid atherosclerosis individually by adjust-
ing for the other 2 components in the same model.
We additionally conducted a series of sensitivity analyses to
ensure the robustness of the results. First, we generated a
weighted HLS by using the percentage of the coefficient of each
individual component to the sum of the coefficients in the
models with all components included; to capture the potential
J-shaped association between physical activity and atheroscle-
rosis, we included both the linear and the quadratic terms of

 physical activity in the creation of the weighed HLS. Second, to
rule out selection bias because of the attrition and missing data,
we used inverse probability weighting to develop a nonresponse
weight for each retained participant based on the baseline
predictors of attrition, including race/ethnicity, education level,
financial strain, marital status, self-rated overall health, depres-
sive symptoms, BMI, menopausal status, high blood pressure,
impaired fasting glucose, and low HDL cholesterol. We repeated
the analyses using the weights in the analysis. Third, we
repeated the analyses by adjusting for financial strain, marital
status, self-rated overall health, and depressive symptoms at
the visit of the carotid scan rather than at baseline. Fourth, we
repeated the analysis by including only the women with HLS
data from all 3 time points (baseline, Visit 5, and Visit 9). Fifth,
we treated carotid plaque as a binary outcome (carotid plaque
index ≥2 versus <2) instead of an ordinal outcome and used
logistic regression models. Sixth, we repeated the analysis
using the 3 visit-specific HLSs instead of the average HLS. All
analyses were conducted using SAS (Version 9.4, SAS Institute
Inc, Cary, NC) at a 2-sided a level of 0.05. The first author had
full access to all the primary data in the study and takes
responsibility for the data analysis.
Results
Descriptive Analyses
Amongthe1143participantsintheanalyticalsample,thosewith
a high average HLS were more likely to have a college degree,
self-reporttheiroverallhealthtobeexcellentorverygood,havea
lower BMI at baseline, be premenopausal at baseline, and use
hormone therapy during the follow-up. Participants with a high
average HLS were less likely to be Hispanic or black, experience
difficulty paying for basics, be separated/widowed/divorced,
experience depressive symptoms, and less likely to have high
blood pressure, impaired fasting glucose, high serum triglyc-
erides, high total cholesterol, low HDL cholesterol, and high LDL
cholesterol at baseline (Table).
The HLS scores were relatively stable over time. The
Spearman correlation coefficient for the HLS score was 0.66
between baseline and Visit 5, 0.70 between Visit 5 and Visit 9,
and 0.66 between baseline and Visit 9. Smoking status did not
appear to change considerably over time, as 93.4% of the study
population did not report a change in smoking status (in terms
of current, past, and never) from baseline to Visit 9. Over half
(54.2%) of the study population reported a change in their
physical activity status (in terms of fully meeting, partially
meeting, and not meeting the recommendation) from baseline
to Visit 9. The Alternate Healthy Eating Index (AHEI) scores
were moderately stable over time. The Pearson correlation
coefficient of the AHEI score was 0.63 between baseline and
Visit 5, 0.69 between Visit 5 and Visit 9, and 0.62 between
baseline and Visit 9. While 711 participants (62.2% of the study
population) remained as never smokers at all 3 visits, only 204
(17.8% of the study population) consistently stayed in the top
tertile of the AHEI scores, and only 82 (7.2% of the study
population) self-reported physical activity status that consis-
tently met the recommendation. Only 19 participants (1.7% of
the study population) remained in the top category for all 3
components at all 3 visits.
HLS and Subclinical Carotid Atherosclerosis
The average HLS over 10 years of follow-up was inversely and
statistically significantly associated with CCA-IMT and CCA-
AD (Figure 2 and Table S2). The inverse associations
persisted even after adjusting extensively for confounders
and physiological risk factors (P=0.0031 and <0.001 for CCA-
IMT and CCA-AD, respectively). In the fully adjusted models,
compared with participants in the lowest level of average HLS
(ie, 0–2), those in the highest level (ie, >4–6) had a 0.024-mm
smaller CCA-IMT (95% CI of b coefficient: �0.048, 0.000), a
difference that equals 17% of the SD of CCA-IMT in the
analytical sample; they also had a 0.16 mm smaller CCA-AD
(95% CI of b coefficient: �0.27, �0.04), a difference that
equals 24% of the SD of CCA-AD. We also observed an inverse
association between average HLS and carotid plaque after
adjusting for major confounders (P=0.024), although the
association failed to retain its statistical significance after
additionally adjusting for physiological risk factors (P=0.25).
Components of HLS and Subclinical Carotid
Atherosclerosis
We estimated the independent associations of each compo-
nent of the HLS by adjusting for the other 2 components in
the same model (Tables S3 through S5, for smoking, diet
quality, and physical activity, respectively). Abstinence from
smoking was strongly and inversely associated with all 3
measures of subclinical carotid atherosclerosis (P-trend<0.01
for all 3 outcome measures). Compared with the participants
who smoked at some point during the follow-up, those who
remained never smokers had a 0.047 mm smaller CCA-IMT
(95% CI of b coefficient: �0.070, �0.024; a 34% SD
difference), a 0.24 mm smaller CCA-AD (95% CI of b
coefficient: �0.35, �0.13; a 36% SD difference), and 49%
lower odds of having a higher carotid plaque index (odds
ratio=0.51; 95% CI: 0.35, 0.73) (Table S3). We observed an
inverse association between average AHEI score and CCA-AD
after adjusting for major confounders and physiological risk
factors (except BMI) (P-trend=0.016). The association lost
significance after further adjusting for BMI (P-trend=0.11). We
observed a marginally significant inverse association between
average AHEI score and CCA-IMT (P-trend=0.067), which also

 lost significance after further adjusting for baseline BMI (P-
trend=0.18). We found no independent association between
average AHEI score and carotid plaque (Table S4). Long-term
physical activity status was marginally significantly associated
with CCA-IMT after adjusting for major confounders (P-
trend=0.059). The association lost its significance after
additionally adjusting for the physiological risk factors. We
found no independent association between long-term physical
activity status and CCA-AD or carotid plaque (Table S5).
Sensitivity Analyses
Results from the sensitivity analyses were consistent with the
primary analyses. The estimates were similar after using the
weighted HLS and including a quadratic term for physical
activity (Table S6). The results did not change appreciably after
accounting for missing data using the nonresponse weights,
adjusting for certain covariates at the visit of the carotid scan
(instead of at baseline), and treating carotid plaque as a binary
outcome. The sensitivity analysis that focused on women with
HLS data from all 3 time points showed stronger associations
between average HLS and subclinical carotid atherosclerosis
compared with the primary analysis. The results were qualita-
tively similar when using the 3 visit-specific HLSs as the
exposures. The HLSs at baseline and Visit 5 displayed weaker
associations with the outcomes compared with the average
HLS, whereas the estimates for the HLS at Visit 9 were similar to
those for the average HLS (data not shown).

 Discussion
This study evaluated the prospective associations between a
composite
HLS
and
measures
of
subclinical
carotid
atherosclerosis in midlife women. The HLS includes 3 health
behaviors—smoking, diet quality, and physical activity—
which are largely modifiable. We found that the level of
average HLS during the midlife over 10 years of follow-up was
significantly associated with smaller CCA-IMT and CCA-AD,
�14 years after baseline. Among the 3 individual components
of the HLS, abstinence from smoking displayed the strongest
inverse associations with subclinical carotid atherosclerosis.
Accumulating evidence from prior studies indicates that
measures of subclinical carotid atherosclerosis are important
predictors of future CVD events6–8 and useful indicators of
cardiovascular risk in apparently healthy individuals.6,8,9 In a
meta-analysis,7 Lorenz et al found that, after adjusting for age
and sex, every 1-SD increase in CCA-IMT was associated with a
26% higher risk of myocardial infarction and a 32% higher risk
of stroke. Similarly, using data from the ARIC (Atherosclerosis
Risk in Communities) Study, Eigenbrodt et al reported that
every 1-SD increase in CCA-AD was associated with 18%
higher hazard of incident cardiac events and 73% higher odds
of prevalent myocardial infarction in women even after
adjusting for CCA-IMT and other CVD risk factors.39 Likewise,
the presence of carotid plaque is associated with 83%, 210%,
and 81% to 196% higher hazard of myocardial infarction,40
stroke,41 and death from coronary heart disease,42,43 respec-
tively, in women without known cardiovascular disease.
Furthermore, the extent of subclinical carotid atherosclerosis
is associated with poorer physical10 and cognitive10–12
functioning even among individuals without clinical CVD or
after adjusting for the intervening clinical CVD outcomes in the
analysis.
Smoking, unhealthy diet, and lack of physical activity are 3
well-known modifiable behavioral risk factors for CVD. In one
of the earliest investigations into overall lifestyle factors and
CVD, Stampfer et al followed midlife women in the NHS
(Nurses’ Health Study) for 14 years for the occurrence of
major coronary events.16 They found that women who did not
smoke, who engaged in moderate-to-vigorous physical activ-
ity for ≥30 min/d, and who had a healthy diet (scored in the
upper 2 quintiles for a diet high in cereal fiber, marine n-3
fatty acids, folate, the ratio of polyunsaturated-to-saturated
fatty acids, and low in trans fat and glycemic load) had 57%
lower odds of a coronary event compared with all the other
women who did not have this healthy lifestyle.16 Qualitatively
similar results indicating an inverse association between a
healthy lifestyle and clinical CVD have been reported in other
studies.17,18 Notably, a recent analysis used data from the
NHS and reported that women with 5 low-risk lifestyle factors
(never smoking, normal BMI, moderate-to-vigorous physical
activity, moderate alcohol intake, and high diet quality) had
74% lower hazard of all-cause mortality and 82% lower hazard
of CVD mortality, compared with those with zero low-risk
factors.44 The projected life expectancy at age 50 years
comparing women with 5 low-risk factors with women with
zero low-risk factors was 14 years (95% CI: 11.8, 16.2)

 longer, 30.8% of which was attributable to reduced CVD
death.44
The potential effect of a healthy lifestyle on the extent of
subclinical atherosclerosis has been evaluated in very few
prior studies.45–47 Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, no
study has examined the association between a composite
HLS and subclinical carotid atherosclerosis in midlife women
undergoing the menopausal transition. There are significant
age and sex differences in the distribution and the determi-
nants of subclinical atherosclerosis.13 Independent of chrono-
logical
aging,
the
menopausal
transition
represents
a
vulnerable window of increased cardiovascular risk1–3 as well
as
an
accelerated
progression
of
subclinical
carotid
atherosclerosis.14,15 As reported in a previous SWAN study,
the progression rate of both CCA-IMT and CCA-AD increased
considerably from the premenopausal stage to the peri-
menopausal and postmenopausal stage.15 In a randomized
trial, Wildman et al implemented a 20-week lifestyle educa-
tion program to women undergoing the menopausal transi-
tion. The program consisted of 15 group meetings led by
nutritional and behavioral interventionalists and was aimed at
reducing total and saturated fat intake, preventing weight
gain, and increasing physical activity. Women in the interven-
tion group had significantly lower body weights and signifi-
cantly higher daily kilocalories of exercise after receiving the
program compared with the control group. The intervention
group also had a slower average progression of carotid IMT
compared with the control group.14 Thus, the midlife repre-
sents a critical window for CVD prevention, and women at this
life stage may be particularly responsive to the beneficial
effect of lifestyle interventions.
We specifically focused on the 3 health behaviors that are
largely modifiable while treating other physiological risk
factors affected by lifestyle (ie, BMI, blood pressure, blood
lipids, and blood glucose) as covariates. Our study is thus
different from previous work using the American Heart
Association’s Life’s Simple 7 goals, which also include the
management of BMI, blood pressure, blood glucose, and total
cholesterol.5 Even after adjusting for the lifestyle-related
physiological risk factors, the adherence to a healthy lifestyle
composed of abstinence from smoking, healthy diet, and
regular engagement in physical activity is inversely associated
with atherosclerosis in midlife women. Adherence to a healthy
lifestyle was low in this study, as only 1.7% of the study
population stayed in the top category for all 3 components at
all 3 time points. This observation is consistent with the NHS,
which reported that only 3% of the cohort had a low-risk
lifestyle.16 The low prevalence of a healthy lifestyle in midlife
women highlights the potential for lifestyle interventions
aimed at this vulnerable population.
Abstinence from smoking showed the strongest inverse
associations with all 3 measures of subclinical carotid
atherosclerosis. Cigarette smoking is a major behavioral risk
factor associated with atherosclerosis, through mechanisms
including thrombosis, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, vas-
cular inflammation, abnormal vascular growth and angiogen-
esis, and loss of endothelial homeostatic and regenerative
functions.48,49 Multiple studies have shown that prolonged
smoking confers a higher CVD risk in women than in
men.50–53 Existing evidence is unclear regarding the asso-
ciations
of
diet
and
physical
activity
with
subclinical
atherosclerosis. We found that diet quality may be associated
with smaller CCA-AD and CCA-IMT, and that engagement in
regular physical activity may be associated with smaller CCA-
IMT. The observed associations for diet and physical activity
lost statistical significance after the adjustment for other
physiological risk factors, especially BMI. We thus speculate
that BMI may partially mediate the potential beneficial effects
of healthy diet and regular physical activity. We did not
include BMI (or obesity/overweight status) as a separate
component of the HLS but instead treated it as a covariate,
because it is not a lifestyle behavior per se, but an
intermediate
health
outcome
affected
by
various
other
lifestyle factors. Formal causal mediation analysis is needed
to quantitatively distinguish the direct effects of diet and
physical activity and their indirect effects mediated by other
physiological risk factors such as BMI. Because of the several
exposures, outcomes, and models examined, this study was
not completely free from multiple comparisons. We did not
quantitatively correct the P values for multiple comparisons
because all the models were based strictly on a priori
hypotheses and the findings were interpreted with caution.
The current study has some important strengths. The use
of repeated measures of behavioral risk factors allowed for a
more accurate measurement of long-term lifestyle. Prior
studies have shown that using cumulative exposures from
repeated measurements may yield stronger associations with
disease outcomes than using only the baseline exposure or
the most recent exposure.54,55 In this study, the average HLS
showed stronger associations with the outcomes compared
with most of the visit-specific scores, though the findings
were largely similar because of the relative stability of the
HLS. The racial/ethnic composition of the study population
was more diverse than most prior studies, because SWAN
included not only non-Hispanic white women but also black,
Chinese, and Hispanic women, 3 groups that are underrep-
resented in the literature. We did not have sufficient statistical
power to examine effect modification by race/ethnicity, so
future multiethnic studies with larger sample sizes are needed
to assess whether the association between lifestyle factors
and subclinical atherosclerosis differs by racial and ethnic
backgrounds.
This study also has some potential limitations. First and
foremost, markers of subclinical carotid atherosclerosis were

 measured only once, at Visit 12/13. Without the baseline
measures, we were unable to evaluate the change of
subclinical atherosclerosis from baseline to Visit 12/13.
Although we restricted the analyses to apparently healthy
participants by excluding women with CVD at baseline or
developed CVD during the follow-up, it is still possible that
some women may already have substantial degrees of
carotid atherosclerosis before baseline. Therefore, we could
not pinpoint the midlife to be the most causally relevant
period for the effect of lifestyle. Second, although the
prospective nature of the exposures and the asymptomatic
nature of the outcomes reduced the extent of reverse
causation, it could not be completely ruled out. It was
possible that some participants with subclinical atheroscle-
rosis also subsequently had other more detectable health
conditions such as abnormal blood lipids or high blood
pressure and would thus intentionally improve their lifestyle;
this may partially explain the J-shaped association observed
for the highest HLS level for which the outcome measures
were similar or even higher than those observed for the
second highest HLS level. Another possible reason for the J-
shaped association is that some physiological covariates
adjusted for in the full model, such as BMI, blood pressure,
blood glucose, and blood lipids, may partially mediate the
effect for the highest HLS level, because the J-shaped
tendency was not evident in the crude or partially adjusted
models. Third, the exposure data inevitably had some
measurement error, especially for the self-reported data of
physical activity and dietary intake. However, both the
physical activity questionnaire28 and the FFQ24,25 used in
SWAN have been validated in similar populations. Also, the
use of up to 3 repeated measures of exposures considerably
reduced
the
measurement
error.
Fourth,
because
the
lifestyle data were not available after Visit 9, we were not
able to capture the lifestyle exposures between Visit 9 and
Visit 12/13. However, 74% of the participants were post-
menopausal by Visit 9, so the average HLS from baseline to
Visit 9 still reasonably represents the lifestyle during the
menopausal transition.
In conclusion, the menopausal transition represents a
crucial, yet understudied, window of increased cardiovascular
risk in women. This prospective study provides evidence that
a healthy lifestyle during the midlife, characterized by
abstinence from smoking, a healthy diet, and engagement in
regular physical activity, is associated with less subclinical
atherosclerosis. We further documented that the prevalence
of these healthy behaviors is extremely low in midlife women.
Thus, this work highlights the growing recognition of the
midlife as a critical window for CVD prevention and strongly
supports the need for lifestyle interventions aimed at
promoting these modifiable health behaviors in midlife
women.
