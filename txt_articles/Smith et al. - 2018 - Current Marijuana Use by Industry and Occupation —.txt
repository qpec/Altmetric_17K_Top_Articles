Current Marijuana Use by Industry and Occupation — Colorado, 2014–2015
Roberta Smith, MSPH1; Katelyn E. Hall, MPH1; Paul Etkind, DrPH2; Mike Van Dyke, PhD1
The effects of marijuana use on workplace safety are of 
concern for public health and workplace safety professionals. 
Twenty-nine states and the District of Columbia have enacted 
laws legalizing marijuana at the state level for recreational 
and/or medical purposes. Employers and safety professionals 
in states where marijuana use is legal have expressed concerns 
about potential increases in occupational injuries, such as 
on-the-job motor vehicle crashes, related to employee impair-
ment. Data published in 2017 by the Colorado Department 
of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) showed that 
more than one in eight adult state residents aged ≥18 years 
currently used marijuana in 2014 (13.6%) and 2015 (13.4%) 
(1). To examine current marijuana use by working adults and 
the industries and occupations in which they are employed, 
CDPHE analyzed data from the state’s Behavioral Risk Factor 
Surveillance System (BRFSS) regarding current marijuana use 
(at least 1 day during the preceding 30 days) among 10,169 
persons who responded to the current marijuana use question. 
During 2014 and 2015, 14.6% of these 10,169 Colorado 
workers reported current marijuana use, with the highest 
reported prevalence among workers in the Accommodation 
and Food Services industry (30.1%) and Food Preparation and 
Serving (32.2%) occupations. Understanding the industries 
and occupations of adults with reported marijuana use can 
help direct and maximize impact of public health messaging 
and potential safety interventions for adults.
The Colorado BRFSS is a CDC-sponsored, state-based, 
random-digit–dialed telephone survey of the noninstitutional-
ized U.S. population aged ≥18 years. The survey collects infor-
mation on health risk factors, preventive health practices, and 
disease status (2). In 2012, 2014, and 2015, two standardized 
employment questions were included in the Colorado BRFSS 
survey (3). Respondents who indicated that their current 
employment status was employed for wages, self-employed, or 
out of work for less than 1 year were asked 1) “What kind of 
business or industry do you work in?” (industry classification), 
and 2) “What is your job title?” (occupation classification). 
In 2014 and in 2015, questions that collected information 
on marijuana use during the past 30 days were added to the 
Colorado survey. Respondents who replied “yes” when asked if 
they had ever used marijuana or hashish were then asked how 
many days during the past 30 days they had used marijuana 
or hashish as well as subsequent questions on use frequency 
and methods. Current use of marijuana was defined as having 
used marijuana or hashish on at least 1 day in the past 30 days.
Using the 2014 and 2015 BRFSS data combined, state-
weighted percentages were calculated, and bivariate analyses 
using a Rao-Scott chi-square test were performed to compare 
the prevalence of marijuana use by age group, sex, and race/
ethnicity. In addition, prevalence and 95% confidence intervals 
(CIs) were calculated to compare the prevalence of marijuana 
use by industry and occupation. Overall BRFSS industry and 
occupation data, representing current Colorado employment, 
were added to illustrate the percentage of employees working 
in the industries and occupations identified within the state.

Percentages of employed persons reporting current marijuana 
use in the industry and occupation comparisons were age-
adjusted based on the 2000 U.S. standard population. The 
overall response rate for the Colorado BRFSS was 57.0% in 
2014 and 55.2% in 2015.
Among the combined 26,936 respondents* in the BRFSS 
2014 and 2015 surveys, 18,848 (70.0%) were given the oppor-
tunity to answer the question of whether they had ever used 
marijuana or hashish, and 18,674 (99.1%) responded (either 
positively or negatively) to the question. Of those respondents, 
10,169 (54.5%) indicated that they were employed or had been 
out of work for less than 1 year. Among the 10,169 workers 
responding, 14.6% reported using marijuana during the pre-
ceding 30 days (Table 1). The prevalence of current marijuana 
use was higher among persons aged 18–25 years (29.6%) than 
among persons aged 26–34 years (18.6%) and persons aged 
≥35 years (11.0%), and higher among men (17.2%) than 
among women (11.3%). By race/ethnicity, prevalence of cur-
rent marijuana use was highest among non-Hispanic whites 
(15.3%), followed by Hispanics (15.1%) and non-Hispanic 
blacks (14.5%) (Table 1).
Among the 10,169 workers, the industry with the high-
est prevalence of current marijuana use (30.1%) was 
Accommodation and Food Services (Table 2). Among occupa-
tions, Food Preparation and Serving had the highest prevalence

of current marijuana users (32.2%), although the age-adjusted 
prevalence was 19.1% (Table 3).
Among safety-sensitive occupations (those in which workers 
have responsibility for their own safety or the safety of oth-
ers), prevalences of current marijuana use among workers who 
acknowledged using marijuana or hashish in the preceding 30 days 
and were employed in Construction and Extraction (16.5%);

Farming, Fishing, and Forestry (16.5%); and Healthcare Support 
(15.8%) were higher than the overall state prevalence of 14.6% 
among employed adults. However, the prevalences of current 
marijuana use among workers in Transportation and Material 
Moving (10.3%) and Healthcare and Technical (3.1%) were lower 
than the overall state prevalence (Table 3)
Reported current use of marijuana was lower in industries 
that are known to perform routine drug testing on employees 
such as the Healthcare and Social Assistance (7.4%); Utilities 
(5.8%); and Mining, Oil, and Gas industries (5.2%) (Table 2). 
Current use also was lower than the overall state prevalence 
in Transportation and Material Moving occupations (10.2%), 
which are subject to federal drug testing requirement (Table 3).
Discussion
This is the first study to use BRFSS data to describe self-
reported current marijuana use among adults working in vari-
ous industries and occupations. Although reported past-month 
marijuana use does not necessarily indicate use or impairment 
on the job, there is some evidence that marijuana use in general 
might increase the risk for nondriving workplace injuries (4) 
Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of work-related

MMWR / April 13, 2018 / Vol. 67 / No. 14
US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
deaths in the United States (5), and studies have linked recent 
marijuana use to an increased risk for motor vehicle crashes 
(6,7). However, although marijuana negatively affects skills 
needed for safe driving, limitations related to roadside and 
toxicology testing, marijuana detection time, and co-use of 
substances contribute to uncertainty about risk. A 2006 study 
using 2000–2001 data from the National Household Surveys 
on Drug Abuse and the 2002 National Survey on Drug Use 
and Health found that workers who were subject to frequent 
workplace drug testing and severe penalties were less likely 
to report past month marijuana use (8). Because BRFSS is a 
public health survey, reporting marijuana use might be more 
representative of actual use by industry and occupation than 
if this information had been collected through an employer-
sponsored survey.
Analysis of age-adjusted prevalences among workers who 
acknowledged ever using marijuana or hashish highlighted 
the impact of younger workers in various industries and 
occupations on prevalence rates. In industries that tend to 
attract younger workers, such as food services, the marijuana 
use prevalence decreased with age-adjustment. For example, 
whereas the unadjusted prevalence of marijuana use among 
adults employed in Food Preparation and Serving occupations 
was 32.2%, the age-adjusted prevalence was 19.1%. Similarly, 
there were large differences in adjusted and unadjusted preva-
lences in the Arts, Entertainment, and Recreation industry, 
which might have a large proportion of younger workers.
The findings in this report are subject to at least six limita-
tions. First, data were collected from adults in Colorado who 
reported being employed at the time of the survey and might 
not be representative of all employed adults in Colorado. 
Second, among respondents to the marijuana question, not 
all responded to the question regarding which industry or 
occupation they were employed in or recorded an industry 
or occupation that could be coded to an existing industry 
or occupation. This resulted in missing data for the 10,169 
workers analyzed. Third, industry and occupation information 
were reported by respondents who were currently employed 
for wages, self-employed, or out of work for less than 1 year. 
A respondent might not have been actively working in the 
industry or occupation recorded, and that could influence 
the prevalence of marijuana use. Fourth, data are self-reported 
and thus are subject to the limitations for such survey data, 
including recall and response bias. Fifth, self-reported data 
might be subject to interviewer and recording errors leading 
to misclassification. These estimates might differ from other 
nationally representative behavior surveillance systems because 
of differences in survey methods, survey type, and topic. 
Finally, current use of marijuana was defined as having used 
marijuana or hashish on at least 1 day in the past 30 days. An 
employee who uses marijuana every day versus one that uses 
only once a month might present different considerations for 
impairment in a workplace. It is also important to note that 
these data do not directly measure working under the influ-
ence of marijuana.
This analysis provides important data for employers con-
sidering or implementing workplace marijuana policies and 
highlight those industries where marijuana use among workers 
might reflect a higher proportion of younger workers, such as 
Accommodation and Food Services and Arts, Entertainment, 
and Recreation. Awareness of possible employee recreational 
marijuana use can inform employer policies regarding drug 
use and workplace impairment. For example, safety-sensitive 
industries that have higher prevalences of self-reported mari-
juana use could consider evaluating their current drug testing 
programs, drug panels used for preemployment screening, and 
testing frequencies, and develop policies regarding tolerance 
of drug use. Drug testing policies need to be explained clearly, 
including expectations around protocols when injuries occur. 
Age-adjusted employment data can help to potentially target 
responsible use education campaigns to particular occupations 
and industries that employ younger workers.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Eight states, including Colorado, have legalized recreational 
marijuana use among persons aged ≥21 years. The association 
between marijuana use and occupational injury is of public 
health concern.
What is added by this report?
During 2014–2015, 14.6% of 10,169 Colorado adult workers 
reported using marijuana in the past 30 days. The highest 
prevalences of current use were among young adults and men, 
and among adults working in the Accommodation and Food 
Services industry (30.1%) and Food Preparation and Serving 
occupation (32.2%).
What are the implications for public health practice?
By understanding the occupations and industries of workers 
who report recreational marijuana use, employers can develop 
appropriately targeted workplace marijuana policies and safety 
awareness campaigns.
