Abstract
Background—Twenty-five million people in the U.S. have limited English proficiency (LEP); 
this growing and aging population experiences worse outcomes when hospitalized. Federal 
requirements that hospitals provide language access services are very challenging to implement in 
the fast-paced, 24-hour hospital environment.
Objective—Determine if increasing access to professional interpreters improves hospital 
outcomes for older patients with LEP
Design—Natural experiment on a medicine floor of an academic hospital
Participants—Patients age ≥50 discharged between Jan 15, 2007–Jan 15, 2010.
Exposure—Dual-handset interpreter telephone at every bedside July 15, 2008–Mar 14, 2009
Outcome Measures—30-day readmission, length of stay (LOS), estimated hospital 
expenditures
Results—Of 8,077 discharges, 1,963 were for LEP, and 6,114 for English-proficient (EP) 
patients. There was a significant decrease in observed 30-day readmission rates for the LEP group 
during the 8-month intervention period compared to 18 months pre-intervention (17.8% vs. 
13.4%); at the same time EP readmission rates increased (16.7% vs. 19.7%); results remained 
significant in adjusted analyses. This improved readmission outcome for the LEP group was not 
maintained during the subsequent post-intervention period when the telephones became less 
accessible. There was no significant intervention impact on LOS in either unadjusted or adjusted 
analyses. After accounting for interpreter services costs, the estimated 119 readmissions averted

Background
Sixty-million Americans speak a language other than English and more than 42% of them 
speak English less than very well – or have limited English proficiency (LEP).1 The increase 
in individuals with LEP in the U.S. and their diffusion to geographic areas where few have 
traditionally resided presents a challenge for healthcare systems to overcome communication 
barriers due to language in order to provide high-quality, patient-centered care.2 In addition, 
as the U.S. population ages, the elderly are becoming increasingly diverse, heightening the 
need for attention to language and cultural barriers to ensure quality health care delivery.3
In an outpatient setting, patients with LEP experience less access than English-speakers to a 
usual source of care as well as lower rates of physician visits and preventive services.4–7 
Even when patients with language barriers do have access to care, they have poorer 
adherence to treatments, decreased comprehension of their diagnoses, lower satisfaction 
with care, increased medication complications, and more obstetric trauma compared to 
English-speakers.8–12
In a 2006 national survey, 63% of hospitals reported encountering patients with LEP either 
daily or weekly.13 In the hospital, individuals with LEP experience more adverse events,14 
and possibly longer hospitalizations as well as higher 30-day readmission rates compared to 
English speakers in settings of limited access to professional interpreters.1516 Access to 
professional interpreters is critical to effective communication and the delivery of high 
quality care17–19 by improved communication, appropriate use of resources and better 
patient and clinician satisfaction.20 Access to professional interpreters at admission and 
discharge has been shown to decrease length of stay and readmission rates in one study;21 
however any use of professional interpretation during hospitalization was associated with 
increased length of stay in another study.22
Unfortunately, access to adequate language services has been stymied by the widespread 
lack of reimbursement for interpreter services.1323–25 While we know that the costs of 
professional interpreter services can be high, the cost is small relative to the total cost of 
hospitalization where the setting lends itself to bundled payments.26 Others have outlined 
the theoretical savings for health systems related to avoidance of errors and liability risk;2728 
however, there are no published data about the degree to which interpreter costs may be 
offset by improved communication leading to better patient outcomes.

 The challenge of providing professional interpreter services is compounded for hospitalized 
patients because of the frequent and brief nature of many interactions, time pressures, the 
need for advance scheduling for in-person interpreters, and the 24-hour nature of hospital 
care.29 National studies have found a discrepancy between hospital policy requiring use of 
professional interpreters and actual practice in which professional interpreter utilization is 
not very robust,232530 illustrating the widespread need for a system that will encourage time-
pressured hospital staff to use professional interpreters instead of using no interpretation or 
untrained interpreters.
In this study we set out to evaluate the impact of increased access to professional interpreters 
by providing a dual-handset telephone with a direct connection to interpreter services at each 
hospital bedside that would facilitate use by all clinical providers. We evaluated the effect of 
the intervention on 30-day readmission rates, length of stay, and estimated hospital 
expenditures using a quasi-experimental design in a real world setting.
Methods
Setting and Participants
We included discharges from the Medicine floor of an academic medical center consisting of 
two separate nursing units; one a step-down unit for higher acuity patients and the other for 
patients with less intensive nursing needs. Discharges occurred between January 15, 2007 
and January 15, 2010. This time-frame begins 18-months prior to the intervention, includes 
the 8-month intervention period, and continues for 10-months after the intervention.
Because in this hospital the younger adult population is predominantly English speaking we 
limited discharges to those for patients ≥50 years old. We excluded discharges with the top 
1% length of stay in our dataset (those 40-days or longer) as these represented hospital stays 
that likely differed substantially from the majority in illness acuity and disease course. We 
further excluded planned admissions for chemotherapy or radiation as these often follow a 
set time-course in the hospital and result in planned and expected readmissions.31 Lastly we 
excluded discharges for patients with missing primary language or with primary language 
documented as ‘unknown’.
Data Sources
We collected interpreter utilization from two interpreter databases: 1) a database kept by 
Interpreter Services to record in-person staff interpreter encounters that recorded the date, 
language, hospital floor and time of the interpretation; 2) a billing database for telephonic 
interpreter encounters from the vendor providing these services that recorded the date, 
language, vendor phone identification number and length of the call. Neither database 
matched an interpreted encounter to a specific patient, thus we standardized interpreter 
utilization (number of interpreted encounters in the database in a given month) to the 
number of Patients with LEP discharged from the floor.
We collected administrative data from Transition Systems Inc (TSI, Boston, MA) billing 
databases that included patient demographics, insurance, costs, ICD-9CM diagnostic codes, 
admission and discharge dates. We collected language data from a registration database.

 Information on a patient’s primary language was entered at the time each patient first 
registered at the medical center, whether for the index hospitalization or for prior clinic visits 
and is based on patient self-report. We have previously validated registration language 
against patient self-report of primary language and ability to speak English in telephone 
interviews and found high agreement with the majority of the errors classifying non-English 
speakers as English-speakers.16
Intervention
The intervention consisted of a dual-handset interpreter telephone at the bedside of every 
patient with LEP (Bedside Interpreter Intervention). These 66 telephones had a programmed 
button that allowed 24-hour access to a professional (trained and tested) medical interpreter 
for more than 100 languages. Immediate availability, bedside location and rapid access 
allowed for dual-handset interpreter phone use by any healthcare team member entering the 
room of any Patient with LEP, no matter how brief the interaction. This intervention began 
as a quality improvement effort on the Medicine floor starting July 15, 2008 and continued 
for 8-months. At the start of the intervention, information about the phones along with a 
demonstration was shared at nursing staff meetings on the floor, and morning report for 
Medicine resident physicians; additionally a pocket card explaining how to use the phones 
was mailed to Medicine attending physicians, and made available to residents when they 
rotated onto the inpatient service by the Medicine Chief Residents.
The intervention ended mid-March, 2009 when a floor remodel led to the removal of phones 
from individual bedsides. While many phones remained on the floor (ranging from 32–44 
during the post-intervention period), they were no longer as easily accessible.
Prior to the intervention, usual-care communication included in-person staff interpreters who 
could be scheduled during usual business hours, and a slowly increasing number of dual-
handset interpreter telephones (ranging from 0–5 during the pre-intervention period). The 
dual-handset telephones were placed on mobile carts and kept at the nursing station or in 
locked cabinets. Once these mobile phones were brought to a patient’s room and connected, 
they were as easy to use as the intervention phones; however, it took additional time to 
locate and bring them to the patient’s room, and often they were in use elsewhere. Placement 
of a dual-handset interpreter telephone at the bedside of each Patient with LEP was intended 
to eliminate these barriers for time-pressured clinicians.
Outcomes
We defined readmission as any inpatient admission to any service occurring ≤30-days from 
the time of the index discharge from the Medicine floor. All discharges from the Medicine 
floor during the study period were eligible to be included as index discharges which could 
result in a readmission; in other words, if a patient were discharged from the Medicine floor, 
readmitted within 30-days, and then discharged again from the Medicine floor, the second 
discharge was considered as an additional index discharge. However, if the patient’s 
readmission resulted in a discharge from a different floor in the hospital, it would not be 
considered an index discharge. Thus an individual patient could have multiple index 
discharges included in the analysis. For this outcome, in keeping with standard methods, we

 excluded discharges with a discharge disposition of ‘transfer to acute facility’, ‘died’, or ‘left 
against medical advice’.31
We defined length of stay (LOS) using the admission and discharge date and time from the 
administrative billing database. After log-transformation, the LOS outcome was 
approximately normally distributed (skewness and kurtosis statistics equaled −0.003 and 
+0.086, respectively), and was modeled via linear regression.
We estimated hospital expenditure savings in the following manner. First, we calculated the 
average cost of an admission for a patient with LEP during the intervention period from the 
administrative billing data. Next, we estimated the number of expected readmissions in the 
LEP group if the pre-intervention readmission rate were held constant during the 
intervention period. Taking the difference between the observed and expected readmission 
rates, we found the number of possible averted readmissions. We then multiplied the number 
of possible adverted readmissions by the average cost of an admission in the LEP group 
during the intervention period, subtracted the cost of the intervention telephone 
interpretations and divided by the number of intervention months to obtain an estimate of 
monthly hospital expenditures savings. Similar methods were used for LOS.
Predictor and Covariates
Our primary effect of interest was the interaction between patient language (primary non-
English language–LEP/English–EP) and study time-period (pre-, intervention, post-). 
Because there was no expectation that the bedside interpreter intervention would have an 
effect on the hospital outcomes of the EP group, this group was included as a non-equivalent 
control group. Examining the interaction between language group and study time-period 
allowed for evaluation of the impact of the intervention on the LEP group while accounting 
for potential secular trends in the outcomes. Additionally, we included the following patient-
level characteristics as covariates: age (≥50 years continuous), sex (M/F), and insurance 
(Medicare/Medicaid/county/private/none); and the following discharge-level characteristics 
as covariates: severity of illness index (SOI) using the All Patient Refined DRG 
Classification System (minor/moderate/major/extreme),32 intensive care unit (ICU) stay 
(yes/no), principal diagnosis (categories according to Healthcare Cost and Utilization 
Project),33 and calendar month.
Statistical Analysis
Descriptive statistics of the discharges compared LEP and EP groups using chi-square for 
categorical and t-tests for continuous variables. Linear (for logged LOS) and logistic (for 30-
day readmission) models regressed the outcome onto a categorical indicator of the study 
periods, patient language group, and the period-by-language interaction, as well as 
covariates describing patient age, sex, insurance, discharge calendar month, principal 
diagnosis category, SOI index, and ICU stay. The 30-day readmission outcome model also 
adjusted for LOS. Subsequently, custom contrasts compared outcome response across the 
three study periods and whether any effects were modified by language group (LEP vs. EP; 
the ‘period-by-language’ interaction). All models were fit via generalized estimating

 equations with exchangeable correlation structure to accommodate repeated hospital stays 
for individual patients.
Results
Descriptive statistics
During the study period there were 8,386 discharges from the Medicine floor; after 
exclusion for top 1% LOS (n=81), chemotherapy or radiation (n=186), and missing or 
‘unknown’ primary language (n=42), there were 8,077 discharges included for patients age 
≥50 (range 50–108), 1,963 (24.3%) for LEP and 6,114 for EP patients. For the readmission 
outcome, an additional 688 (8.5% in both LEP and EP groups) discharges with disposition 
of ‘transfer to acute facility’ (n=135), ‘died’ (n=484) or ‘left against medical advice’ (n=69) 
were excluded, resulting in 7,389 discharges eligible for readmission analysis.
Patients in the LEP group on average, were older than those in the EP group, had higher 
rates of Medicare insurance, were more often admitted for a respiratory illness, and more 
often discharged to a skilled nursing facility. There were no significant differences between 
groups in the distribution of SOI index, or in the proportion with an ICU stay. (Table 1) For 
the entire sample over the full 36 months of the study, overall 30-day readmission rate was 
17.6%, and mean LOS was 5.53 days and median LOS was 3.70 days (IQR 2.01–6.64), with 
no significant overall differences between the LEP and EP groups for either outcome.
Intervention Fidelity: Interpreter Utilization
Pre-intervention there were low, but slowly increasing, rates of professional interpreter use 
over the telephone. Immediately following intervention implementation, telephonic 
professional interpreter use increased considerably. In the post-intervention period, some 
increased utilization was sustained despite decreased telephone accessibility. (Figure 1) 
These differences varied by patient language, with the largest rise and fall of telephone 
interpreter utilization for Spanish speaking patients. (Table 2) In-person professional 
utilization was low (<0.5 in-person interpreted encounters/LEP discharge) throughout the 36 
months of the study.
Outcomes
30-Day Readmission—Observed 30-day readmission decreased during the intervention 
period and increased again post-intervention. (Table 3) In adjusted analyses, the effect of the 
intervention on readmission rates was significantly modified by patient language group; that 
is, the effect of the study periods on readmission rates significantly differed across the two 
language groups (p = .040 for test of interaction). The odds of readmission for the LEP 
compared with EP group was lower during the intervention period; while it was roughly 
equivalent during both the pre- and post- intervention periods. (Table 4)
Length of Stay—There was no significant impact of the bedside intervention on LOS. The 
unadjusted median LOS did not differ between LEP and EP groups over the three study time 
periods. (Table 3) In adjusted analyses, the effect of intervention intensity on LOS was not 
significantly modified by patient language (p = .818 for test of interaction). (Table 4)

 Estimated hospital expenditures
The dual-handset telephones used in the intervention were provided free of cost by the 
vendor telephonic interpreting company. During the 8-month intervention, there were 28,284 
minutes of interpreted calls billed at a cost of $0.99/minute for an intervention cost of 
$28,001. During the course of the study, the median cost of a hospital stay in the LEP group 
was $11,086. If the rate of readmissions for the LEP group had stayed steady at the pre-
intervention rate (17.8%) rather than falling (to 13.4%) during the high intensity intervention 
period, we estimate there would have been an additional 119 readmissions during the high 
intervention period. The projected cost of these additional readmissions would have equaled 
$1,319,234. Subtracting out the cost of the interpreted calls, the estimated net savings related 
to the Bedside Interpreter Intervention over this 8-month time period equaled $1,291,233, 
for an estimated monthly healthcare expenditure savings of $161,404. Because there was no 
impact of the intervention on LOS, we did not estimate any change in hospital expenditures 
related to LOS.
Discussion
Providing easy access to professional interpreters via dual-handset telephones at the bedside 
in the acute-care hospital was associated with decreased 30-day readmission rates for 
patients with a language barrier. This improvement was lost once the telephones became less 
accessible. Having a telephone in every patient room, immediately available to clinicians at 
any time, was a key component to the success of the intervention. We consider this to be an 
effective implementation of access to professional interpretation in the hospital for a modest 
cost that improves the quality of care for patients with LEP.
Our results are consistent with one other study that demonstrated that professional 
interpreter utilization at admission and/or discharge was associated with decreased 
readmission rates.21 However, our study is the first to demonstrate that a systems 
intervention to increase access to those interpreters throughout the hospital stay both 
decreased readmission rates and estimated hospital expenditures.
The intervention had no impact on hospital LOS even after adjustment for severity of illness, 
ICU stay and principal diagnosis. Other studies have found mixed effects of a language 
barrier on length of stay.15162122 These conflicting findings may be because in some cases 
better communication may lead to shorter LOS due to a diagnosis being made sooner, for 
example, but in other cases it may lead to longer LOS due to proper history taking, symptom 
awareness, information about needs at home on discharge, etc. In one study, the authors 
hypothesized that clinicians were reserving interpreter use for the sickest patients, thus 
interpreter utilization was associated with a longer LOS.22 It is not surprising that results for 
LOS differ from those for readmission because the impact on readmission likely results from 
avoiding clinical and communication errors and enhancing discharge preparedness; whereas, 
the impact of easy access to professional interpreters throughout the hospitalization likely 
has the effect of sometimes increasing and sometimes decreasing LOS depending on the 
clinical situation.

 In this natural experiment the intervention ended when a remodel disrupted immediate 
bedside access to the telephones. We observed a concomitant drop-off in utilization of 
professional interpretation as access and the number of telephones decreased. However, this 
decrease in accessibility did not eliminate interpreter phone utilization, which still remained 
considerably higher than in the pre-intervention period. Interestingly, the utilization data 
show differential use of the dual-handset interpreter phones by language. While Spanish-
speaking patients had equal utilization when the phones were most easily accessible during 
the high intensity intervention period, their utilization dropped off the most when the phones 
were less accessible. Prior studies have shown that physicians often attempt to ‘get by’ when 
they have even partial non-English language skills.29 Our own previous survey of nurses and 
physicians working on the same Medicine floor demonstrated that many reported ‘getting 
by’ with Spanish language skills in particular.34 It is likely that when the phones were easily 
available in every room, clinicians opted to use professional interpreters with Spanish-
speaking patients, but when the phones became less available, those with partial-language 
skills in Spanish reverted to the ‘getting by’ behavior.
Limitations
The interpreter phone billing dataset did not record types of clinical interactions, and so we 
were not able to evaluate whether specific types of interpreted interactions were more 
important than others for preventing readmission, or whether the phones were used 
throughout the hospitalization course. However, our previous work surveying nurses and 
physicians shortly before and after implementation of the Bedside Interpreter Intervention 
did demonstrate that use of professional interpreters increased for all types of clinical 
interactions throughout the hospital course.35 Furthermore, a prior study that surveyed 
patients with LEP on interpreter use during their hospitalization, showed very low use 
during hospital stay by both nurses and physicians other than at admission and discharge.29
Similarly, we did not have interpreter data for individual patients, so it is possible that some 
patients had many interpreted encounters and others none. Without these data, we were 
unable to investigate whether those without interpreted encounters were readmitted more 
often. Thus, our findings of a positive overall impact of a systems intervention are consistent 
with an ‘intention to treat’ type of analysis, and a ‘per protocol’ type of analysis was not 
possible.
We do not know why readmission rates increased for English-speakers at the same time that 
LEP rates decreased. While it is possible that this was a negative unintended consequence of 
an intervention focused only on the LEP population, this explanation does not have much 
face validity as the telephones were rolled-out over a brief period, and then were simply 
maintained in each room and only used when an patient with LEP was housed in that room. 
Additionally, during the intervention period, the average interpretation time for patients with 
LEP was less than 20 minutes per day, which is at least what we would expect nurses and 
physicians combined to spend with an individual patient.
This intervention was focused largely on access provision, without a dedicated push from 
leadership; and, because the phones were not widely available on other floors, physicians 
taking care of patients on multiple floors may not always have thought to use them on this

 one floor. Given this limitation, it is possible that our findings are an underestimate of the 
potential impact with a more supported and universal roll-out.
Our study only encompassed the experience of a single institution with limited interpreter 
use in the hospital before starting the intervention. However, the low level of interpreted 
encounters during the pre-intervention period was not unlike the expected levels in most 
hospitals in the country at the same time, the majority of which continue to face the 
challenge of providing linguistic access to patients with LEP as required by Health and 
Human Services interpretation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act and Final Rule 
implementing the prohibition of discrimination under the Affordable Care Act.3637 Finally, 
our study included only patients 50 years and older, but because on average adult patients 
with LEP are 20 years older than EP patients in this hospital, we likely did not exclude many 
LEP adults. However, our results may not be as generalizable to hospitals serving a younger 
LEP population.
Finally, we did not conduct a formal cost study, but rather only were able to estimate 
potential expenditure savings associated with the lower rate of readmission during the 
intervention period.
Conclusion
We observed a decrease in readmissions for limited English proficient patients that 
corresponded to the increase in access to professional interpreter services, and no overall 
change in length of stay. Comprehensive language access for Patients with LEP represents 
an important service that all medical centers should provide in order to achieve equitable, 
high quality healthcare for vulnerable LEP populations. While there are modest costs 
associated with professional interpretation, this is offset by estimated hospital expenditure 
savings which will be increasingly meaningful in the era of population-based health and 
accountable care organizations, and is a small price to pay for more equitable care.

*Percentages may not add up to 100% due to rounding error
**Based on the APR DRG index which calculates severity of illness categorizing each patient into one of four categories: minor/moderate/major/extreme
***Principal diagnosis ‘other’ includes less than 5% in each of the following categories: diseases of musculoskeletal system and connective tissue; diseases of blood and blood-forming organs; mental 
illness; diseases of the nervous system and sense organs; symptoms, signs and ill-defined conditions; diseases of the skin and subcutaneous tissue; congenital anomalies; residual and unclassified codes. 
There were no diagnoses in the following categories: complications of pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium; certain conditions originating in the perinatal period.
