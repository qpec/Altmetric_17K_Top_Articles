Abstract
Pancreatic cancer is a devastating disease that is largely refrac-
tory to currently available treatment strategies. Therapeutic resis-
tance is partially attributed to the dense stromal reaction of
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma tumors that includes a perva-
sive infiltration of immunosuppressive (M2) macrophages. Nab-
paclitaxel (trade name Abraxane) is a nanoparticle albumin-
bound formulation of paclitaxel that, in combination with gem-
citabine, is currently the first-line treatment for pancreatic cancer.
Here, we show that macrophages internalized nab-paclitaxel via
macropinocytosis. The macropinocytic uptake of nab-paclitaxel
induced macrophage immunostimulatory (M1) cytokine expres-
sion and synergized with IFNg to promote inducible nitric oxide
synthase expression in a TLR4-dependent manner. Nab-paclitaxel
was internalized by tumor-associated macrophages in vivo, and
therapeutic doses of nab-paclitaxel alone, and in combination
with gemcitabine, increased the MHCIIþCD80þCD86þ M1 mac-
rophage population. These data revealed an unanticipated role for
nab-paclitaxel in macrophage activation and rationalized its
potential use to target immune evasion in pancreatic cancer.

Introduction
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a lethal disease
with a 5-year survival rate of less than 6%. A defining feature of
PDAC is its prominent desmoplastic reaction with an extensive
leukocytic infiltration dominated by macrophages (1). Depend-
ing on signals that prevail within their microenvironment, macro-
phages can adopt a variety of functional states. In response to
bacterial products such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and Th1
cytokines, macrophages become immunostimulatory (M1). M1
macrophages are characterized by high expression of nitric oxide
synthase (iNOS), MHC class II (MHCII) proteins, CD80, CD86,
and TNFa, and can exert tumoricidal effects (2). In contrast, in the
presence of Th2 cytokines, macrophages acquire an alternatively
activated state (M2) that is immunosuppressive, tumor promot-
ing, and is characterized by the expression of Arginase 1, CD206,
and low amounts of MHCII (2). Although tumor-associated
macrophages (TAM) in the pancreas exhibit both M1 and M2
phenotypes, higher M2:M1 ratios correlate with disease progres-
sion and shorter survival in patients (1, 3).
Abraxane (nab-paclitaxel) is a nanoparticle albumin-bound
formulation of paclitaxel that, in combination with gemcitabine,
is currently the first-line treatment for pancreatic cancer (4). The
primary mechanism of antineoplastic activity of paclitaxel is its
ability to stabilize microtubules and prevent cell division of
rapidly dividing tumor cells. However, in macrophages, pacli-
taxel can exert cell-cycle–independent effects by acting as an
LPS mimetic and inducing M1 polarization in a Toll-like
receptor 4 (TLR4)–dependent manner (5–7). We therefore
sought to investigate the effects of nab-paclitaxel on macro-
phage polarization. We report that nab-paclitaxel is internal-
ized by macrophages principally via macropinocytosis and is
sufficient to drive macrophage M1 polarization in vitro and in
vivo. These data reveal a previously unappreciated mechanism
of action of nab-paclitaxel and suggest that nab-paclitaxel may
co-operate with immunotherapeutic agents to restore immune
recognition in PDAC.

Synthesis of Oregon green–labeled paclitaxel and
nab-paclitaxel
Albumin-bound
Oregon
Green
488–labeled
paclitaxel
(OG-nab-paclitaxel) was prepared by coupling Oregon Green
488–labeled paclitaxel (OG-paclitaxel; Thermo Fisher Scientific,
CN P22310) to human serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich; CN
05420). Briefly, 0.9 mg OG-paclitaxel was dissolved in 64.8 mL
chloroform and 7.2 mL ethanol and added to 18 mg human serum
albumin dissolved in 3.6 mL water with vigorous stirring. The
suspension was sonicated at 40% amplitude for 4 cycles of 1
minute each with 30-second intervals. The organic solvent was
then evaporated using rotavapor at 40�C. The resulting suspen-
sion was distributed equally into glass vials and lyophilized to
obtain dry OG-nab-paclitaxel amenable to long-term storage
at �20�C.
Macropinocytosis assays
Macropinocytosis assays, image acquisition, image processing
tools, and macropinosome quantification were performed as
previously described (9). For ex vivo nab-paclitaxel uptake assays,
orthotopic tumors were cut into approximately 3 mm � 3 mm
sections and incubated for 20 minutes at 37�C in serum-
free medium containing Oregon Green–labeled nab-paclitaxel
(0.5 mg/mL). Tumor sections were then washed once with PBS at
room temperature and immediately embedded in Tissue-Tek
OCT medium (VWR) and fixed for 1 hour on dry ice. Fixed tumor
sections were stored at �80�C until cryosectioned and mounted
on coverslips to be stained for immunofluorescence.
Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry on tumor sections was performed as
previously described (10).
Cell sorting and flow cytometry
Staining for cell sorting and flow cytometry analysis was per-
formed by incubating single-cell suspensions with primary fluo-
rochrome-labeled antibodies on ice for 30 minutes. For cell
sorting, cells were washed once with FACS buffer (PBS supple-
mented with 1% FBS) and immediately sorted on an SY2300 cell
sorter (Sony). For flow cytometry, cells were fixed in 3.7% form-
aldehyde diluted in FACS buffer overnight at 4�C prior to analysis.
For IL1a staining, cells were permeabilized and fixed with FoxP3/
Transcription Factor Staining Buffer Set (eBioscience CN00-5523)
for 45 minutes at 4�C and stained overnight at 4�C. All samples
were washed once with FACS buffer prior to analysis on an LSRII
UV flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Collected data were ana-
lyzed using FlowJo data analysis software (V10).

orthotopically implanted mice were treated intraperitoneally with
gemcitabine (120 mg/kg, Gemzar, Eli Lilly) and nab-paclitaxel
(120 mg/kg, Abraxane; Abraxis Bioscience) resuspended in sterile

Results
Macrophages internalized nab-paclitaxel via macropinocytosis
Macrophages undergo constitutive macropinocytosis, a form
of nonselective fluid-phase endocytosis that, together with recep-
tor-activated phagocytosis, regulates antigen sampling and scav-
enging of invading pathogens (11). Macropinocytosis is also an
established route of internalization of many nanoparticle for-
mulations (12). Given that macrophages constitute a dominant
immune infiltrate in PDAC, we set out to assess the extent and
mode of nab-paclitaxel internalization by macrophages. To this
end, the macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 was incubated with
high molecular weight TMR-labeled dextran (TMR-dextran), an
established marker of macropinosomes, and Oregon Green–
labeled nab-paclitaxel (OG-nab-paclitaxel). OG-nab-paclitaxel
localized predominantly to dextran-positive macropinosomes
(Fig. 1A). Furthermore, OG-nab-paclitaxel internalization was
reduced following treatment with the macropinocytosis inhib-
itor 5-[N-ethyl-N-isopropyl] amiloride (EIPA), indicating that
nab-paclitaxel internalization depended on a macropinocytotic
uptake mechanism (Fig. 1B). To determine the contribution of
phagocytosis to nab-paclitaxel internalization, we tested the
requirement of Fc receptors for uptake because, unlike other
major phagocytic receptor families, Fc receptors are constitutive-
ly active in macrophages (13). Inhibition of Fc receptors I and III
with blocking antibodies to CD16 and CD32 (14) did not affect
the internalization of OG-nab-paclitaxel (Fig. 1C). Moreover,
depletion of intracellular calcium, required for constitutive
macropinocytosis but not Fc receptor–dependent phagocytosis
in macrophages (15, 16), effectively blunted OG-nab-paclitaxel
uptake (Fig. 1D). Together, these data demonstrate that nab-
paclitaxel is internalized by macrophages predominantly via
macropinocytosis.
Macropinocytosis of nab-paclitaxel drove M1 macrophage
activation in vitro via TLR4
Consistent with recent findings by Tanei and colleagues (17),
we did not observe significant cytotoxic effects of nab-paclitaxel
on macrophages at concentrations required for its internalization
(data not shown). Therefore, we assessed the capacity of nab-
paclitaxel to induce macrophage M1 activation. Because paclitaxel
promotes M1 polarization by acting as an LPS mimetic (18), we
evaluated the effect of nab-paclitaxel treatment on the induction
of a panel of LPS-inducible cytokines. Treatment of RAW 264.7
cells with nab-paclitaxel was sufficient to induce the gene expres-
sion of Il1a, Il1b, Il6, Il12b (Il12 p40), and Tnfa in a similar manner
to free paclitaxel (Fig. 2A). Nab-paclitaxel also increased IL1a,
IL1b, IL6, and TNFa protein expression to a similar extent as LPS
(Supplementary Fig. S1). Nab-paclitaxel–dependent M1 cytokine
expression was inhibited by EIPA and BAPTA-AM, but not by
blocking antibodies to the Fc I and III receptors, demonstrating
that macropinocytosis was required for its LPS mimetic effects
(Fig. 2B). The tumor cell inhibitory function of M1 macrophages
is partially attributed to the upregulation of inducible nitric oxide
synthase (iNOS), an enzyme that catalyzes the production of
tumor cell cytotoxic nitric oxide from L-Arginine (19). It has been
shown that LPS synergizes with IFNg to induce iNOS protein
expression in macrophages (20, 21). Similarly, nab-paclitaxel
treatment induced robust iNOS expression in the presence of
IFNg (Fig. 2C). The expression of the nab-paclitaxel–driven iNOS
gene and protein was partially inhibited by EIPA (Fig. 2D), further
supporting the idea that macropinocytosis of nab-paclitaxel con-
tributes to its M1 polarizing effects. Paclitaxel induces macro-
phage activation via binding to myeloid differentiation factor
2 (MD2), an adaptor protein to TLR4 (18). Indeed, we found
that the TLR4 inhibitor CLI-095 abrogated nab-paclitaxel and
LPS-dependent Il1a, Il1b, Il6, Il12b, and Tnfa gene expression
(Fig. 3A and Supplementary Fig. S2) and iNOS protein expression
(Fig.3B). These results indicate that nab-paclitaxel signals through
the TLR4 receptor.
Nab-paclitaxel induced M1 activation in pancreatic TAMs
in vivo
Next, we sought to determine whether nab-paclitaxel could
induce M1 polarization of macrophages in the pancreatic tumor
microenvironment. To this end, we employed an orthotopic
model of PDAC in which cells isolated from primary pancreas
tumors of KrasLSL-G12D/þ, Trp53LSL-R172H/þ, Pdx1-Cre (KPC) trans-
genic mice were surgically implanted into the pancreas of immu-
nocompetent syngeneic wild-type animals. In this model, the cells
formed tumors within 2 weeks after implantation and exhibited
an extensive F4/80þ macrophage infiltrate (Fig. 4A). To determine
whether TAMs can internalize nab-paclitaxel, we incubated pan-
creatic tumors with OG-nab-paclitaxel and found that F4/80þ
cells within the tumor took up nab-paclitaxel (Fig. 4B). Moreover,
83% of CD45þ F4/80þ cells isolated from KPC orthotopic tumors
by FACS internalized OG-nab-paclitaxel following ex vivo treat-
ment (Supplementary Fig. S3A). To determine whether nab-
paclitaxel internalization induces M1 polarization of pancreatic
tumor–associated macrophages in vivo, we treated orthotopic
tumor–bearing mice with a single therapeutic dose of nab-pac-
litaxel, alone or in combination with gemcitabine, and analyzed
the functional activation of macrophages within the tumor 48
hours after treatment (Fig. 4C). Optimal macrophage activation
by immunogenic stimuli requires both the upregulation of anti-
gen-presenting MHCII molecules and the induction of T-cell
costimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 at the cell surface
(22). Analysis of the MHCIIþCD80þCD86þ cell population by
flow cytometry revealed that single-agent nab-paclitaxel was
sufficient to increase the MHCIIþCD80þCD86þ macrophage
population within the tumors compared with vehicle-treated
mice, with no change in total macrophage numbers across treat-
ment cohorts (Fig. 4C and Supplementary Fig. S3B). Nab-pacli-
taxel treatment also induced an increase in IL1a protein

Discussion
Taxanes, and in particular paclitaxel, represent an important
class of antitumor agents that have proven to be effective in the
treatment of a number of solid malignancies. The albumin-
bound form of paclitaxel, nab-paclitaxel, has fewer side effects,
shows increased tumor cell cytotoxicity, and patients have
higher overall response rates, compared with equal doses of
solvent-based
paclitaxel
in
breast,
non–small
cell
lung
(NSCLC), and pancreatic cancers (23). The improved tumor
response to nab-paclitaxel has been attributed to elevated
intratumoral concentrations mediated by binding of albumin
to endothelial 60-kDa glycoprotein receptor (gp60; ref. 24),
thereby facilitating vascular transcytosis. It has been proposed
that the antitumor activity of nab-paclitaxel might be attributed
to its binding to SPARC, a cell surface receptor with sequence
homology to gp60 that is expressed on multiple tumor cell
types (25, 26). Our findings reported here suggest that nab-
paclitaxel–dependent tumor cell killing may be additionally
mediated via its immunostimulatory effects on TAMs. The
potential relevance of this tumor cell–extrinsic mechanism in
the context of PDAC is supported by the observation that
paclitaxel provides limited clinical benefit despite exhibiting
comparable effects on microtubule function to nab-paclitaxel
in tumor cells (27). In murine and human studies of PDAC,
nab-paclitaxel more effectively reduces stromal density relative
to solvent-based taxanes (27–30). As the activation of pancre-
atic stellate cells is influenced by M2 macrophages (31), the
stromal-depleting consequences of nab-paclitaxel treatment on
the tumor stroma could reflect its effect on macrophage M1
polarization. Both breast cancer and NSCLC, malignancies for
which nab-paclitaxel is a standard treatment regimen (23),
have extensive immunosuppressive macrophage infiltrates
(32, 33). Thus, the proposed mode of action of nab-paclitaxel
in promoting macrophage activation might be of broad rele-
vance to tumor sites in which the drug shows therapeutic
benefits.
Paclitaxel promotes M1 polarization via direct binding to MD2,
an extracellular adaptor protein of TLR4 (18). Upon activation,
TLR4 is rapidly internalized into endosomes and engages down-
stream signaling pathways via endocytic shuttling (34). TLR4
internalization and trafficking is required for efficient LPS-depen-
dent TLR4 signal propagation (34). Although macropinosomes
and endosomes are formed as distinct vesicular entities, they fuse
in the course of their intracellular trafficking (35). It is therefore
plausible that the macropinocytic uptake of nab-paclitaxel
enables it to act on endosomal TLR4 complexes. Whether this
mode of activation provides the means to increase the local
effective concentration of paclitaxel, and/or induce a different
signaling repertoire, remains to be established. Inflammatory
stimuli, including IFNg and TNFa, induce a shift from phagocy-
tosis to macropinocytosis for the internalization of pathogens by
macrophages (36). Nab-paclitaxel–mediated M1 induction may
therefore result in positive feedback signaling, promoting further
uptake of drug and enhancing its M1-activating effects in both an
autocrine and paracrine fashion. Together, these data support the
hypothesis that macropinocytosis of the albumin formulation of

 paclitaxel promotes its M1-polarizing effects and may account for
its elevated activity over solvent-based formulations of paclitaxel.
One study suggests that nab-paclitaxel treatment may induce
tumor cell toxicity via its internalization and subsequent release
by macrophages in the tumor microenvironment (17). However,
because a direct uptake of nab-paclitaxel by macrophages was not
formally demonstrated in that study, the relevance of this pro-
posed mechanism to our findings that nab-paclitaxel mediates
M1 activation cannot be ascertained.
Single-agent immunotherapies designed to activate cytotoxic
T cells have shown little benefit in PDAC, despite showing efficacy
in many solid tumors (37–39). Given that pancreatic tumor–
associated macrophages can contribute to an immunosuppressive
microenvironment by inhibiting cytotoxic T-cell function (40),
immune recognition may be improved by combining nab-pacli-
taxel with T-cell immunotherapies. Considering the highly immu-
nocompromised microenvironment of PDAC, however, it is likely
that more potent M1 agonists may be required to restore immune
surveillance. Several macrophage-activating immunotherapies
are in clinical trials for the treatment of a variety of malignancies,
including blocking antibodies to colony stimulating factor 1 (41);
TLR-activating agents PAM3CSK4 (42) and Poly I:C (43); and
blocking antibodies to IL10 (44). It is possible that coupling such
agents to albumin nanoparticles may improve their delivery to
macrophages in the tumor microenvironment and more efficient-
ly restore immune recognition. Employing albumin nanoparti-
cles as vehicles for macrophage-activating agents may therefore
serve broad applicability in a variety of tumor types exhibiting
extensive M2 infiltration.
