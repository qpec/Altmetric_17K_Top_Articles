Effect of Dilute Apple Juice and Preferred Fluids vs
Electrolyte Maintenance Solution on Treatment Failure
Among Children With Mild Gastroenteritis
A Randomized Clinical Trial
Stephen B. Freedman, MDCM, MSc; Andrew R. Willan, PhD; Kathy Boutis, MD; Suzanne Schuh, MD
IMPORTANCE Gastroenteritis is a common pediatric illness. Electrolyte maintenance solution
is recommended to treat and prevent dehydration. Its advantage in minimally dehydrated
children is unproven.
OBJECTIVE To determine if oral hydration with dilute apple juice/preferred fluids is
noninferior to electrolyte maintenance solution in children with mild gastroenteritis.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Randomized, single-blind noninferiority trial conducted
between the months of October and April during the years 2010 to 2015 in a tertiary care
pediatric emergency department in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Study participants were
children aged 6 to 60 months with gastroenteritis and minimal dehydration.
INTERVENTIONS Participants were randomly assigned to receive color-matched half-strength
apple juice/preferred fluids (n=323) or apple-flavored electrolyte maintenance solution (n=324).
Oral rehydration therapy followed institutional protocols. After discharge, the half-strength
apple juice/preferred fluids group was administered fluids as desired; the electrolyte
maintenance solution group replaced losses with electrolyte maintenance solution.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was a composite of treatment failure
defined by any of the following occurring within 7 days of enrollment: intravenous
rehydration, hospitalization, subsequent unscheduled physician encounter, protracted
symptoms, crossover, and 3% or more weight loss or significant dehydration at in-person
follow-up. Secondary outcomes included intravenous rehydration, hospitalization, and
frequency of diarrhea and vomiting. The noninferiority margin was defined as a difference
between groups of 7.5% for the primary outcome and was assessed with a 1-sided α=.025.
If noninferiority was established, a 1-sided test for superiority was conducted.
RESULTS Among 647 randomized children (mean age, 28.3 months; 331 boys [51.1%]; 441
(68.2%) without evidence of dehydration), 644 (99.5%) completed follow-up. Children who
were administered dilute apple juice experienced treatment failure less often than those
given electrolyte maintenance solution (16.7% vs 25.0%; difference, −8.3%; 97.5% CI, −� to
−2.0%; P < .001 for inferiority and P = .006 for superiority). Fewer children administered
apple juice/preferred fluids received intravenous rehydration (2.5% vs 9.0%; difference,
−6.5%; 99% CI, −11.6% to −1.8%). Hospitalization rates and diarrhea and vomiting frequency
were not significantly different between groups.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among children with mild gastroenteritis and minimal
dehydration, initial oral hydration with dilute apple juice followed by their preferred fluids,
compared with electrolyte maintenance solution, resulted in fewer treatment failures. In
many high-income countries, the use of dilute apple juice and preferred fluids as desired may
be an appropriate alternative to electrolyte maintenance fluids in children with mild
gastroenteritis and minimal dehydration.

T
he annual burden of acute gastroenteritis in the United
States includes 178.8 million related episodes and
473 832 hospitalizations.1 Pediatric gastroenteritis
therapy is focused on oral rehydration solution administra-
tion to prevent and treat dehydration2 whenever diarrhea
occurs.3,4Evidence supporting this approach has emerged
primarily from low- and middle-income countries. Similar
benefits may not arise from routine electrolyte maintenance
solution administration in locations where significant dehy-
dration is uncommon.
Electrolyte maintenance solution is relatively expensive5,6
anditstastecanlimituse.6 Inasurvey,62%ofcaregiversstated
a preference for intravenous rehydration rather than ongoing
electrolyte maintenance solution administration for their child
with gastroenteritis.7 Challenges associated with electrolyte
maintenancesolutionadministrationoftenresultinintravenous
rehydration when children are brought for emergency depart-
ment(ED)care.8,9Thus,thereremainsaneedtoimproveoralre-
hydration success in children with minimal dehydration.
To address this question, we randomized children seeking
ED care with gastroenteritis and minimal dehydration to con-
sume half-strength apple juice followed by their preferred flu-
ids or to the exclusive use of electrolyte maintenance solution
to replace losses.4 We hypothesized that allowing children to
drinkdiluteapplejuicefollowedbytheirpreferredfluidswould
not result in an increased frequency of treatment failure com-
pared with electrolyte maintenance solution use.
Methods
Design and Setting
We performed a single-center, randomized, single-blind non-
inferiority trial (Figure 1) in the ED of a tertiary care pediatric
hospital in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, that provides care to ap-
proximately 55 000 children annually, including approxi-
mately 3000 children with gastroenteritis.
Study Population
Following triage, research nurses evaluated potentially eli-
gible children 6 days per week, 12 hours per day, between Oc-
tober and April of the 2010 to 2015 calendar years. Eligible chil-
dren were aged 6 months to 60 months who presented with
the following: 3 or more episodes of vomiting or diarrhea10 in
the preceding 24 hours; less than 96 hours of symptoms;
weight of 8 kg (17.7 lb) or higher; and minimal dehydration.4
Dehydration was quantified using the 4-item, 8-point Clini-
cal Dehydration Scale.8,11-14 Children with Clinical Dehydra-
tion Scale scores lower than 5 and capillary refill of less than 2
seconds15 were classified as having minimal dehydration. Chil-
dren were excluded if they had a history of chronic gastroin-
testinal disease (eg, inflammatory bowel disease, celiac dis-
ease) or other diseases (eg, diabetes mellitus, inborn errors of
metabolism) that complicated the clinical picture; prematu-
rity with corrected postnatal age of less than 30 weeks; bil-
ious vomiting, hematemesis, hematochezia, or clinical con-
cern for acute abdomen; or a need for immediate intravenous
rehydration (eTable 1 in Supplement 1). Only Ontario resi-
dents were eligible to enable data verification from provin-
cial registries. The protocol and analysis plan (Supplement 2)
was approved by the hospital’
s research ethics board. Guard-
ians of all participants provided written informed consent.
Allocation
Children were randomly assigned to receive half-strength
apple juice/preferred fluids or electrolyte maintenance solu-
tion in a 1:1 ratio using computer-generated blocks of 8. The
study team was unaware of the block sizes. Research support
pharmacy staff, who were not responsible for patient selec-
tion, enrollment, or treatment allocation, created and stored
the randomization table, which they used to prepare the
study solutions and randomization assignment instructions.
The latter were inserted into identical, opaque, sealed enve-
lopes that were consecutively numbered on the outside and
stored in a locked cabinet. Color-matched, refrigerated study
solutions were prepared in opaque, identical-appearing
bottles (eAppendix 1 in Supplement 1). The randomized dis-
charge instructions were directly provided to families on ED
discharge. Guardians opened the envelope at home. Nurses
responsible for data collection did not participate in random-
ization envelope preparation. Randomization table assign-
ments were not disclosed until analyses were finalized.
Study Interventions
The study protocol (eFigure in Supplement 1) was initiated
immediately following triage and prior to physician evalua-
tion to minimize contamination through electrolyte mainte-
nance solution provision. The intervention group received
half-strength apple juice; the control group received
apple-flavored, sucralose-sweetened Pediatric Electrolyte
(Pharmascience), an electrolyte maintenance solution. All par-
ticipants received 2 L of their assigned solution for use in the
EDandathomefollowingdischarge.NonexperimentalEDtreat-
mentswereimplementedaccordingtoacceptedstandards3,4,16
and institutional guidelines.
Children received 5-mL aliquots of the assigned fluid every
2to5minutes.Thosewhovomitedreceivedoralondansetron.17,18

siciancouldcontinueoralrehydrationwiththesameoralternate
(ie, crossover) solution or administer intravenous hydration.
Postdischarge Care
On the opaque envelope containing the home allocation as-
signment, the research nurse specified the fluid volume to be
provided to replace losses: 2 mL/kg per vomiting episode and
10 mL/kg per diarrheal episode.4 Children in both groups re-
ceived discharge instructions with the contents regarding rec-
ommended rehydration solutions removed. Families were
given the option of research nurse reevaluation 72 to 84 hours
after enrollment.

(2) subsequent unscheduled physician encounter in an of-
fice, urgent care, or ED setting for the same episode of vom-

for 24 hours); (3) protracted symptoms (ie, ≥3 episodes of vom-
iting or diarrhea within a 24-hour period occurring >7 days af-
ter enrollment); (4) physician request to administer a solu-
tion representing treatment allocation crossover at the index
visit; or (5) a 3% or greater weight loss or Clinical Dehydration

ponentsoftheprimarycompositeoutcomewerealsoconducted.
All diagnoses associated with health care visits as coded in the
CIHIandNACRSdatabasesoccurringwithin14daysoftheindex
ED visit were reviewed to identify adverse events (eg, hypona-
tremia, seizure, intensive care unit admission).
Statistical Analysis
Sample size was based on the composite primary outcome of
treatment failure and the null hypothesis that the probability
of treatment failure in the apple juice/preferred fluids group
was at least 7.5% higher than that in the electrolyte mainte-
nance solution group; the alternative hypothesis was no dif-
ference. Enrolling 624 participants yielded 80% power to re-
ject the null hypothesis (ie, apple juice/preferred fluids is
inferior) when the alternative was true, using a 1-sided α=.025.
Sample size was determined using an estimated 15% failure
probabilityintheelectrolytemaintenancesolutiongroup23and
a 10% loss to follow-up18 (PASS 2008, version 08.0.2; NCSS).
Rejecting the null hypothesis would lead to the conclusion that
apple juice followed by preferred fluids was not inferior and
could be considered a therapeutic option. The noninferiority
margin of 7.5% was set only for the primary end point, was de-
termined through a focus group discussion with experts in the
field, and was based on the difference participants were will-
ing to accept in exchange for the perceived benefits associ-
ated with apple juice use along with other fluids as desired.
Analyses were undertaken by intention-to treat prin-
ciples. Continuous data are presented as means with stan-
dard deviations and medians with interquartile ranges (IQRs).
The primary efficacy analysis evaluated noninferiority by cal-
culating the 95% confidence interval for the difference in prob-
ability of failure (ie, apple juice/preferred fluids minus elec-
trolyte maintenance solution). If the upper bound of the 95%
CI for this difference was less than the inferiority margin
(ie, +7.5%), inferiority could be rejected. If noninferiority was
confirmed, a test for superiority would be conducted at the
1-sided α=.025 level, according to the recommendation of
the Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products.24 Com-
parisonsbetweengroupsforthesecondaryoutcomeswereper-
formedusinganindependentsamplettestforcontinuousvari-
ables, the Fisher exact test for categorical variables, and the
Wilcoxon rank-sum test for non–normally distributed vari-
ables.ABonferronicorrectionwasusedtoassessstatisticalsig-
nificance for the secondary outcomes, and significance was set
at the P=.01 (ie, .05/5) level. Frequency of diarrhea and vom-
iting follow a Poisson distribution18 and were analyzed with a
regression model following that assumption.
A planned exploratory analysis evaluated the interaction
between age and treatment effect. A logistic regression model
was used containing the following independent variables: an
indicator variable for treatment group; age in years; the natu-
ral log of age; and the interactions between both treatment
group and age and group and the natural log of age. The model
depicting treatment failure as a function of age was displayed
graphically to facilitate interpretation and includes the thresh-
old odds ratio for noninferiority.
An independent data and safety monitoring committee
performed an interim analysis after 200 participants were re-
cruited.Theyadoptedtheoptionofstoppingthestudyifaben-
efit in favor of electrolyte maintenance solution was shown
such that the nominal significance levels proposed by
Haybittle25 were met: a probability value of .001 for the in-
terim analysis and .025 for the final analysis. Analyses were
performed with SPSS, version 19.0.0.1 (SPSS Inc) and SAS, ver-
sion 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc).

647), telephone (88.3%; 571/647), diary (31.5%; 204/647), in-
person visit (3.3%; 21/647), and letter (1.6%; 10/647).
Primary Outcome
In the intention-to-treat analysis, which encompassed all
events occurring at the index visit and during follow-up, the
treatment failure rate was 16.7% (54/323; 95% CI, 12.8%-
21.2%) in the apple juice/preferred fluids and 25.0% (81/324;
95% CI, 20.4%-30.1%) in the electrolyte maintenance solu-
tion group (difference, −8.3%; 97.5% CI, −� to −2.0) (Table 2).
These findings are consistent with noninferiority, with the up-
per bound of the 1-sided 97.5% CI for the difference in failure
beinglessthantheprespecifiednoninferioritymarginof+7.5%.
The P value for the null hypothesis of inferiority was P<.001.
Testing for superiority yielded a P=.006. Including only par-
ticipants with available follow-up after the index ED visit
yielded a failure rate of 16.8% (54/322; 95% CI, 13.1%-22.0%)
in the apple juice/preferred fluids group and 25.2% (81/322;
95% CI, 20.0%-30.2%) in the electrolyte maintenance solu-
tion group (difference, −8.4%; 97.5% CI, −� to −2.1%; P<.001
for inferiority).
Exploratory analysis identified a nonlinear interaction be-
tween treatment assignment and age (Figure 2 and Table 2).
The threshold odds ratio of 1.44 was calculated using the treat-
ment failure rate in the control group (25%) and the thresh-
old failure rate for the intervention group (32.5%). The latter
was calculated by adding the a priori–determined margin of
noninferiority (7.5%) to the study treatment failure rate in the
control group. The combined test of significance for the inter-
action and the nonlinearity of the interaction was P = .01. In

electrolyte maintenance solution, 9.0% [29/324]; difference,
−6.5%; 99% CI, −11.6% to −1.8%). Hospitalization rates were
0.9% (3/323) vs 2.8% (9/324) in the apple juice/preferred flu-
ids and electrolyte maintenance solution groups, respec-
tively (difference, −1.9%; 99% CI, −5.4% to 1.3%). Subsequent
unscheduled medical visits, extended symptomatology, cross-
over at the index ED visit, and weight loss or dehydration at
follow-up did not differ significantly between groups (Table 2
and eTable 4 in Supplement 1).
Secondary Outcomes
Intravenous rehydration administration at the index ED visit
was less frequent in the apple juice/preferred fluids group
(apple juice, 0.9% [3/323] vs electrolyte maintenance solu-
tion, 6.8% [22/324]; difference, −5.9%; 99% CI, −10.5% to
−2.0%) (Table 2). Reasons for intravenous rehydration at
the index visit included ongoing dehydration (n = 10), inad-
equate oral intake (n = 6), vomiting (n = 3), and other (n = 6).
Diarrhea and vomiting episodes were not significantly differ-
ent between groups (rate ratio, electrolyte maintenance
solution:apple juice/preferred fluids, 1.14 [99% CI, 0.79-1.64;
P = .39] for diarrhea and 1.07 [99% CI, 0.77-1.49; P = .60] for
vomiting) (Table 2 and eTable 5 in Supplement 1). Median
percentage weight change at reassessment was 0.00% (IQR,
−0.55% to 0.37%) in the apple juice/preferred fluids group
and −1.19% (IQR, −3.58% to 0.43%) in the electrolyte mainte-
nance solution group (P = .18).
Two children were hyponatremic (1 in the apple juice/
preferred fluids group with sodium level of 133 mEq/L and
1 in the electrolyte maintenance solution group with sodium
level of 134 mEq/L) at the time of intravenous insertion.
No other adverse events were reported or identified. In 598 of
617 cases (96.9%), the physicians reported being unaware
of the randomization assignment; they judged assignment
correctly in 2 of 4 children (50%) in the apple juice/preferred
fluids group and 11 of 15 (73%) in the electrolyte maintenance
solution group (P = .16). Insufficient data were available to
evaluate electrolytes at revisit, caregiver satisfaction, or ease
of protocol adherence.
Discussion
In this single-center trial in a high-income country, children
with mild gastroenteritis and minimal dehydration experi-
enced fewer treatment failures when offered dilute apple juice
followed by their preferred fluid choice compared with those
instructed to drink electrolyte maintenance solution to re-
place fluid losses. The benefit was greatest among children
older than 24 months. Dilute apple juice administration fol-
lowed by desired fluids resulted in a reduction in the intrave-
nous rehydration rate.
These results challenge the recommendation to rou-
tinely administer electrolyte maintenance solution when di-
arrhea begins.4 This recommendation is based primarily on an
unblinded study in which blocks of participants were pro-
vided instructions for use of electrolyte maintenance solu-
tion or instructions plus a prescription for electrolyte main-
tenance solution at no charge.19 Although a reduction in
unscheduled follow-up care was noted, the number needed
to treat was 16 (95% CI, 8-508) and no differences were noted
in ED visits or hospitalization.19 Although performed post hoc,
our findings differed because we did not find differences in un-
scheduled visits between groups. The present study find-
ings, derived from a larger and more heterogeneous popula-
tion, confirmed via provincial registries, and conducted in an
era when complicated episodes of gastroenteritis have be-
come uncommon,26 may more accurately reflect the effect re-
hydration fluid choice has on unscheduled medical visits.
The use of beverages with high sugar content has tradi-
tionally been discouraged because of their potential to in-
duceanosmoticdiarrhea.3,4,27However,studiesevaluatingthis
issue have found the effect to be minimal. Brazilian investi-
gators randomized 90 children with severe diarrhea to con-
sume water, apple juice, or grape juice.28 Although those re-
ceiving juice had more stool losses on the first day, no
differences persisted beyond the first day. Children fed juice
ingested more calories and had greater weight gain. In a trial
of 75 adults admitted with gastroenteritis in India, stool fre-
quency, consistency, and body weight improved similarly
among those randomized to an electrolyte maintenance so-
lution (139 mmol/L of glucose) or a high-sugar-content sports
drink (111 mmol/L of glucose and 117 mmol/L of sucrose).29 In
thecurrentstudy,thefrequencyofdiarrhealstoolswasnotsig-
nificantly different between study groups despite the permit-
ted use of high-glucose fluids in the apple juice/preferred flu-
ids group. These results provide pragmatic evidence that in

The threshold odds ratio of 1.44 for noninferiority is based on the actual failure
rate (25%) in the electrolyte maintenance solution group in our study using the
a priori–determined margin of noninferiority (7.5%), yielding the threshold
failure rate of 32.5% for the half-strength apple juice/preferred fluids group.
The observed odds ratio was 0.60 (ignoring age). A nonlinear relationship was
identified among age, treatment failure, and treatment group (ie, half-strength
apple juice/preferred fluids or electrolyte maintenance solution). The best
model contained a term for group, age, the natural log of age, and the
interactions between group and age and group and the natural log of age. The
model on which this figure is based is specified in eAppendix 5 in Supplement 1
and was generated from the estimated parameters (log odds ratios and
corresponding variances and covariances) from the logistic regression model.

childrenwithminimaldehydration,promotingfluidconsump-
tion is more important than the glucose load consumed.
A concern related to the administration of hyponatremic
solutionsistheriskofwaterintoxication.30,31Althoughthecur-
rent study monitored for the occurrence of hyponatremia
through daily follow-up and a provincial registry, no epi-
sodesofsignificanthyponatremiawereidentified.Suchevents
have become rare and are more likely to occur in infants32 ex-
periencing significant diarrheal salt losses. The decline in se-
vere rotavirus disease in developed countries has further re-
ducedthefrequencyofthisoutcome.Moreover,theintentional
exclusion of high-risk children (ie, aged <6 months) is an im-
portant consideration when nonelectrolyte maintenance so-
lutions are administered.
The use of intravenous rehydration in the study’
s target
population was minimized through a focus on the key con-
tributing risk factors—vomiting and failure to drink.18,33 To
minimize vomiting, ondansetron was administered in accor-
dance with our institutional protocol at a frequency in keep-
ing with current usage trends in pediatric gastroenteritis.34 To
maximize electrolyte maintenance solution palatability, a
refrigerated,35 sucralose-sweetened solution was provided.36
Despitethesemeasures,thekeydifferencebetweengroupswas
the greater frequency of intravenous rehydration in the elec-
trolyte maintenance solution group. The plausibility of the re-
sults presented is supported by exploratory analysis, which
identified an interaction between age and the intervention:
older children, who are more accustomed to drinking apple
juice and other sweet beverages,37 are less likely to become de-
hydrated, and are more taste discriminating35 than younger
children,experiencedthegreatestbenefitfromthediluteapple
juice/preferred fluids diet.
A previous study evaluating sucralose-sweetened apple-
flavoredelectrolytesolutionsreportedapalatabilityscoreofonly
64 mm (SD, 8 mm) on a 100-mm visual analog scale, and only
70% of participants (children without evidence of enteric in-
fection) indicated that they would drink the solution again.36
Moreover, refusal to drink has been identified as the most com-
mon reason pediatric emergency medicine physicians provide
intravenousrehydrationtochildreninlieuoforalrehydration.38
Given that the results presented demonstrate neither con-
cerns regarding unblinding (which most likely would have led
to the increased use of intravenous rehydration in the dilute
apple juice/preferred fluids group) nor differential use of other
adjunctive therapies (eg, ondansetron), these findings most
likely reflect the effect of the intervention.
Several limitations should be considered. This study was
conducted in a high-income country. Because children in
low- and middle-income countries are at higher risk of
gastroenteritis-related complications, the results should not
be extrapolated to such settings. This was a single-center
study and the control solution was an apple-flavored,
sucralose-sweetened electrolyte maintenance solution; gen-
eralizability of study results to other settings and electrolyte
maintenance solutions is uncertain. Although 68% of study
participants had no evidence of dehydration (ie, Clinical
Dehydration Scale score of 0), this is similar to dehydration
characteristics reported in other ED-based studies.8,12 None-
theless, according to a statement endorsed by the American
Academy of Pediatrics, oral rehydration solution should be
used, even in children without evidence of dehydration, to
compensate for losses.39
Children were not blinded to taste, and this may have re-
sulted in unblinding of clinical team members in the ED. How-
ever,physicianblindingassessmentdidnotconfirmthistheory.
Taste matching was not performed because palatability dif-
ferences were required to evaluate the effect of the interven-
tions. The 2 study liquids were color matched to minimize un-
blinding of parents and physicians in the ED. Parents were not
blinded to the home therapy assignment in order to guide their
home fluid management strategy. In addition, volume of flu-
ids consumed, patient adherence, and crossover at home were
not measured; the latter 2 may have driven the difference in
the primary outcome (ie, treatment failure) toward the null.
Conclusions
Among children with mild gastroenteritis and minimal dehy-
dration, initial oral hydration with dilute apple juice followed
by their preferred fluids, compared with electrolyte mainte-
nance solution, resulted in fewer treatment failures. In many
high-income countries, the use of dilute apple juice and pre-
ferred fluids may be an appropriate alternative to electrolyte
maintenance solution use in children with mild gastroenteri-
tis and minimal dehydration.
