In the developed world, extreme prematurity is the leading cause of neonatal mortality and
morbidity due to a combination of organ immaturity and iatrogenic injury. Until now, efforts to
extend gestation using extracorporeal systems have achieved limited success. Here we report
the development of a system that incorporates a pumpless oxygenator circuit connected to
the fetus of a lamb via an umbilical cord interface that is maintained within a closed ‘amniotic
fluid’ circuit that closely reproduces the environment of the womb. We show that fetal lambs
that are developmentally equivalent to the extreme premature human infant can be
physiologically supported in this extra-uterine device for up to 4 weeks. Lambs on support
maintain stable haemodynamics, have normal blood gas and oxygenation parameters and
maintain patency of the fetal circulation. With appropriate nutritional support, lambs on
the system demonstrate normal somatic growth, lung maturation and brain growth and
myelination.

 I
n the United States, extreme prematurity is the leading cause
of infant morbidity and mortality, with over one-third of all
infant deaths and one-half of cerebral palsy attributed to
prematurity1–3.
Advances
in
neonatal
intensive
care
have
improved survival and pushed the limits of viability to 22 to
23 weeks of gestation. However, survival has been achieved with
high
associated
rates
of
chronic
lung
disease
and
other
complications of organ immaturity, particularly in infants born
before 28 weeks1,3. In fact, with earlier limits of viability, there are
actually more total patients with severe complications of
prematurity than there were a decade ago4. Respiratory failure
represents the most common and challenging problem, as gas
exchange in critically preterm neonates is impaired by structural
and functional immaturity of the lungs. This condition, known as
bronchopulmonary dysplasia, is now understood to be related to
an arrest in lung development secondary to premature transition
from liquid to gas ventilation, explaining why even minimally
invasive modes of neonatal ventilation have not reduced the
incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia5. There is clearly an
urgent need for a more physiologic approach to support the
extreme premature infant.
The concept of extracorporeal support of the fetus is appealing
due to the analogy with innate fetal physiology, in which
extracorporeal gas exchange is maintained by the placenta.
However, the development of an ‘artificial placenta’ has been the
subject of investigation for over 50 years6,7, with only limited
success. The primary obstacles have been progressive circulatory
failure due to preload or afterload imbalance imposed on the fetal
heart by oxygenator resistance and pump-supported circuits, the
use of open fluid incubators resulting in contamination and fetal
sepsis and problems related to umbilical vascular access resulting in
vascular spasm6–15. To address these obstacles we have designed
a system consisting of three main components, specifically,
a pumpless arteriovenous circuit, a closed fluid environment with
continuous fluid exchange and a new technique of umbilical
vascular access. Here we demonstrate that extreme premature fetal
lambs can be consistently supported in an extracorporeal device for
up to 4 weeks without apparent physiologic derangement or organ
failure. These results are superior to all previous attempts at
extracorporeal support of the extreme premature fetus in both
duration and physiologic well-being16,17.
Results
Pilot studies. A series of pilot studies leading to our final device
were performed that identified potential obstacles and allowed
sequential design modifications. All pilot studies utilized the
pumpless
arterial–venous
(AV)
circuit
described
below.
The primary design modifications were related to the fluid
environment and our approach to vascular access. A consistent
observation throughout our pilot studies was the haemodynamic
stability and efficient gas exchange achieved by the pumpless
AV circuit over a wide range of circuit flows. The initial
series of experiments were performed in late gestational lambs
(125–140 days of gestation; term ¼ 145 days) and utilized an open
fluid bath with continuous recirculation of an electrolyte solution
(designed to mimic amniotic fluid) through micropore filters. To
avoid the potential for umbilical venous spasm we utilized the
carotid artery (CA) and jugular vein (JV) for vascular access
(Table 1, open CA/JV). These studies lasted 23 to 108 h but were
limited by sepsis and cannula-related complications. This led to
our second design that included a semi-closed fluid bath with
continuous exchange of amniotic fluid, rather than recirculation
(Table 1, semi-closed CA/JV). With the improved incubator, five
experimental animals with CA/JV cannulation (ranging in age
from 120 to 125 days of gestation) were maintained on the system
for 346.6±93.5 h, a marked improvement over the original
design. Importantly, one animal was maintained on the circuit for
288 h (120–132 days of gestation) and was successfully weaned to
spontaneous respiration, with long-term survival confirming that
animals can be transitioned to normal postnatal life after
prolonged extra-uterine support. However, sepsis remained
limiting in 3 of 5 lambs resulting in design of a closed fluid circuit
(the Biobag). With introduction of the Biobag, pilot studies were
performed with the aim to apply our system to earlier gestational
fetuses. From the perspective of lung development, lambs at
100 � 115 days of gestation are in the mid to late canalicular
phase of lung development18, which is the biological equivalent of
the 22–24-week gestation premature human infant19. However,
in 110-day gestational age (GA) lambs with CA/JV cannulation,
diminishing circuit flows and progressive oedema developed
within the first few days. Low circuit flows were due to reduced
perfusion pressures across the oxygenator owing to lower mean
arterial pressure in earlier GA lambs combined with elevated
right-sided venous pressures in the 110-day GA CA/JV animals
relative to published in utero controls (inferior vena cava
pressures 9.6±2 mm Hg versus 4±2 mm Hg, respectively)20–22.
To offload the right atrium, we opted to utilize the umbilical vein
(UV) for venous inflow to mimic normal fetal umbilical venous
return and improve streaming of oxygenated blood across the
foramen ovale20,21. To avoid umbilical venous spasm23–25, we
advanced the umbilical venous cannula to a position with the tip
just inside the abdominal fascia. CA/UV cannulation resulted in
the stable support of five 106–113-day GA lambs for 13 to 26 days
in the Biobag (Table 1, Biobag, CA/UV). All five lambs
demonstrated long-term haemodynamic stability and stable
circuit
flows
and
oxygenation
parameters
(CA/UV
group
in Fig. 2). However, flow to the oxygenator in CA/UV lambs
was well below the normal physiologic flow to the placenta
(70–120 versus 150–200 ml kg � 1 min � 1)26–28, primarily due to
the inherently small-caliber carotid artery. The limiting problem
of carotid vascular inflow led to the development of our final
device
to
achieve
physiologic
fetal
support
(Fig.
1
and
Supplementary Movie 1). The three components of the system
are described below.
A pumpless arteriovenous circuit. From the inception of the
study, we reasoned that a pumpless circuit—in which blood flow is
driven exclusively by the fetal heart—combined with a very low
resistance oxygenator would most closely mimic the normal
fetal/placental circulation. In most of our studies we utilized a small-
volume, near-zero-resistance oxygenator and short segments of
circuit tubing to minimize surface area and priming volumes. This
system is comparable to the volume of the placenta itself—the
reported placental blood volume of the sheep is 23.1 to 48.1ml per
kg29, and most of the studies in this report utilized the Quadrox-ID
Pediatric oxygenator (Maquet Quadrox-ID Pediatric Oxygenator:
Maquet Cardiopulmonary AG, Rastatt, Germany) that has a priming
volume of 81ml. Recently, with smaller lambs (0.5 to 1kg) we have
utilized a modified Quadrox Neonatal oxygenator (Maquet Quadrox-
I Neonatal and Pediatric Oxygenator: Maquet Cardiopulmonary AG)
with a priming volume of 38ml. Thus, our circuit priming volumes
for 1 to 3kg lambs are within the normal placental blood volume
range. Throughout the development of our device, with the exception
of our earlier gestational CA/JV animals described above, all animals
demonstrated complete haemodynamic stability, without need for
vasopressors or evidence of progressive acidosis or circulatory failure.
A closed sterile fluid environment. To further address issues of
sterility, size adaptability and efficiencies of space and fluid volume,
a ‘Biobag’ design was developed—a single-use, completely closed

mized to more closely replicate the size and shape of the uterus.
The Biobag consists of polyethylene film that is translucent,
sonolucent and flexible to permit monitoring, scanning and
manipulation of the fetus as necessary. An open, sealable side was

 cannulation, and various water-tight ports were designed to
accommodate cannulas, temperature probes and sterile suction
tubing. After cannulation, the Biobag is sealed and transferred to
a mobile support platform that incorporates temperature and
pressure regulation, padding and the fluid reservoirs and fluid
exchange circuitry. The development of the Biobag essentially
solved the problem of gross fluid contamination, and has elimi-
nated pneumonia on lung pathology. Throughout the subsequent
experiments, low-level amniotic fluid contamination was observed
only in circumstances where Biobag re-entry was required. When
this occurred, contamination could be cleared by increasing the
fluid exchange rate and injecting antibiotics into the bag fluid
on a daily basis.
Umbilical
vascular
access.
To
more
closely
approximate
flow dynamics in utero, carotid cannulation was abandoned in
favour of double umbilical artery and single umbilical vein
cannulation (abbreviated UA/UV) cannulation. We developed
a technique for umbilical cord vessel cannulation that maintains
a length of native umbilical cord (5–10 cm) between the cannula
tips and the abdominal wall, to minimize decannulation events
and the risk of mechanical obstruction (Fig. 1b,c). The umbilical
and venous cannulas are only 2 cm long, most of which is used
for securing the cannulas, and therefore the interface is
functionally end to end. Umbilical cord spasm was mitigated
by
a
combination
of
topical
papaverine
administration,
atraumatic operative technique and maintaining warmth and
physiologic oxygen saturation of the umbilical venous inflow
on initiation of circuit flow. The Biobag was modified to
accommodate exclusively umbilical cannulas (Fig. 1b,c and
Supplementary Movie 1).
Physiologic extracorporeal support of the fetus. The combina-
tion of the pumpless oxygenator circuit, the closed fluid circuit and
Biobag
and
umbilical
cord
access
constitute
our
device.
We have run 8 lambs with maintenance of stable levels of
circuit flow equivalent to the normal flow to the placenta.
We have run 5 fetuses from 105 to 108 days of gestation for
25–28 days, and 3 fetuses from 115 to 120 days of gestation
for 20–28 days (Table 1, Biobag UA/UV). The longest runs
were terminated at 28 days due to animal protocol limitations
rather than any instability, suggesting that support of these
early gestational animals could be maintained beyond 4 weeks.
Haemodynamic
and
circuit
flow
parameters
for
all
eight
UA/UV lambs are summarized in Fig. 2 and compared directly with
CA/UV lambs. The UA/UV lambs demonstrated levels of circuit
flow comparable to what is considered normal placental flow
(Fig. 2c, 150–250 ml kg� 1 min� 1) throughout the duration of their
runs. With physiologic circuit flows in UA/UV animals, we were
able to maintain lower post-membrane saturation (Fig. 2d) with
normal fetal oxygen delivery (Fig. 2f) and reduced transfusion
requirement (Fig. 2e) relative to CA/UV lambs. To prevent exces-
sive oxygen delivery, we typically lowered initial sweep-gas oxygen
concentration to 11–14% by blending nitrogen with room air.
Normal oxygen delivery is required for physiologic metabolic
support, substrate utilization and growth and development.

 Figure 3a shows the calculated parameters related to oxygen
delivery for our UA/UV lambs on both the 5 earlier gestation
lambs (105 to 108 days of gestation) and the 3 later gestation
lambs (115 to 120 days of gestation). The values for both groups
are comparable to the previously published normal values for
fetal lambs30. During studies, efforts were made to maintain
normal fetal oxygen tension and carbon dioxide exchange while
providing normal oxygen delivery (Fig. 3b). In CA/UV lambs a
progressive fall in haemoglobin (Hgb) levels was noted, ultimately
requiring transfusion with a large volume of adult blood
(B40 ml kg � 1 per week) to maintain O2 delivery. We reasoned
that this was likely due to impaired erythropoietin production
from the fetal liver due to supraphysiologic O2 content of the
post-membrane UV blood31. Subsequent experiments with the
first three UA/UV animals demonstrated reduced transfusion
requirement (B10 ml kg � 1 per week), likely due to lower
PaO2 in UV blood. In the last five UA/UV animals we
administered daily erythropoietin that slowed the progression of
anaemia and nearly eliminated (B6 ml kg � 1 per week) or, in the
last 3 animals, completely eliminated the need for blood
transfusion (Fig. 3c). Fetuses had normal pH values (Fig. 3d)
and lactate levels (Fig. 3e) throughout the studies.
Daily echocardiography confirmed physiologic cardiac outputs
and maintenance of the fetal cardiac circulation throughout
the UA/UV runs, with near-normal ductus arteriosus flows
(Fig. 4a–c), patency and flow through the ductus venosus
and right to left shunting through the foramen ovale (Supple-
mentary Movies 2–4)32. Cardiac contractility was excellent
and chamber and vena caval size could be used as an indicator
of general volume status, allowing adjustments in fluid admini-
stration. An experienced fetal cardiologist (J.R.) reviewed all
echocardiographic
data
and
agreed
that
cardiac
function
appeared grossly normal in all respects.
Growth and organ maturation. The nutrition provided via
the circuit was based on substrate uptake of late-gestation
fetal
lambs33–35,
and
hence
consisted
predominantly
of
carbohydrate and amino acid, with trace lipid. Our strategy in
CA/UV and UA/UV lambs was to titrate dextrose and amino acid
administration to levels of plasma glucose (o40 mg dl � 1) and
blood urea nitrogen (o30 mg dl � 1) to avoid an osmotic diuresis
and/or
hyperosmolar
state.
Substrate
tolerance
generally
correlated
with
oxygen
delivery,
and
at
relatively
higher
oxygen delivery, UA/UV lambs tolerated physiologic levels of
substrate delivery (Fig. 5a) and demonstrated growth comparable
to breed-matched controls (Fig. 5b,c). From a qualitative
perspective, there was obvious growth and maturation with
prolonged runs. Animals opened their eyes, became more active,
had apparently normal breathing and swallowing movements,
grew wool and clearly occupied a greater proportion of space
within the bags (Fig. 1b,c). The addition of insulin infusions
in the last two lambs further improved substrate utilization
and
allowed
administration
of
higher
caloric
loads
with
further enhancement of fetal growth.
As a surrogate for organ maturation in our system, we assessed
lung maturation in UA/UV lambs by detailed morphometric
analysis (Fig. 6a–e), histologic assessment (Fig. 6f–i), surfactant
protein B analysis (Fig. 6j,k) and analysis of function after
birth (Fig. 6m). Lambs at 106 � 113 days of gestation are in
the mid to late canalicular phase of lung development18, which is
the biological equivalent of the 23–24-week gestation premature
human
infant19.
Morphometric
analysis
demonstrated
progression from the canalicular to saccular stages of lung
development in parallel with age-matched normal control lambs
(Fig. 6a–e). From a functional perspective, lambs were easily
ventilated after removal from the circuit, and nearly comparable
to 141-day GA control lambs delivered by caesarean section
and
immediately
ventilated
(Fig.
6m).
Other
metabolic
parameters reflective of organ function and nutritional status
were
surprisingly
stable
despite
the
known
maternal
contributions to hepatic and renal function (Table 2). Bilirubin
levels and liver function tests showed only very mild elevation or
remained within the normal range.

 Brain growth and development were also assessed in UA/UV
animals. Brains were grossly normal appearing after runs with no
difference in brain-to-body weight ratios in experimental animals
versus age-matched in utero controls (Fig. 7a). To assess brain
maturation we analysed gyral thickness that also demonstrated
no difference from controls (Fig. 7b). Biparietal diameter has
been reported as a surrogate for brain growth36 and the growth
curve for lambs maintained on our system was similar to the
expected
curve
determined
from
weight-based
calculations
(Fig. 7c)37. As the effects of exogenous insulin on brain growth
are unknown, animals receiving insulin were excluded from brain
growth assessments (n ¼ 2). On whole-brain sectioning we
observed no evidence of haemorrhage or infarct in any of the
UA/UV animal brains (n ¼ 5). Finally, to assess ischaemic injury
and global brain integrity on the surviving lamb, postnatal
T1-, T2- and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging
sequences were performed at 6 months of age (Fig. 7d). Despite
utilization of the CA in this animal, there was no evidence of
ischaemia or structural defects. To confirm these findings at
a histologic level we performed routine haematoxylin and eosin
staining on critical brain regions (Fig. 8a) and, as white matter
is
particularly
sensitive
to
ischaemic
injury,
we
assessed
critical regions of the brain by densitometry of myelin-stained
sections38–40 in UA/UV animals. There was no difference in
myelin density in any of the brains analysed (Fig. 8b–d). In
addition, neuropathologists from two separate institutions were
unable
to
identify
any
histologic
lesions
associated
with
ischaemia,
infarction
or
demyelination
when
blinded
to
experimental and control tissues.
From a gross functional level, the UA/UV animals demon-
strated normal or increased movement, sleep/wake cycles,
intermittent breathing and swallowing and generally appeared
comfortable and nondistressed. Fetal breathing movements were
noted regularly throughout the incubation period. As one
measure
of
neurologic
development,
we
compared
ocular
electromyography (EMG) in two chronically catheterized fetal
lambs41, with two lambs maintained in the system over the same
range of gestation. A developmental progression from fragmented
to consolidated sleep/wake cycles between the two gestational
ages is apparent in both in utero and experimental animals
(representative data shown in Fig. 8e). Finally, although brain
perfusion was not directly assessed, the middle cerebral artery
pulsatility index was routinely measured and correlated with
oxygen delivery (Fig. 8f), consistent with normal autoregulation
of cerebral blood flow. Taken together with our observation of
normal cardiac outputs, oxygen delivery and fetal circulatory
pathways, we feel our limited data to this point is encouraging
with respect to cerebral perfusion and brain development.
It is important to note however that there are important
differences between fetal lamb brain maturation and human
brain maturation, most important of which is the earlier
maturation of the germinal matrix in the lamb (70 days)42.
Thus, the risk of intracranial haemorrhage cannot be assessed
in the ovine model43. In addition, long-term neurologic follow-up
is difficult in our model, due to difficulties with survival
of premature lambs and to the limitations in assessment of
lamb neurologic function. Thus, any conclusions regarding
neurologic development must be qualified.
Discussion
A pumpless circuit powered by the fetal heart is not a new
concept and has been the initial approach taken by many
investigators23–25,44–46.
The
advantages
include
simplicity,
absence of pump-induced haemolysis and the potential for at
least some autoregulation of circuit blood flow. The disadvantages
of pumpless systems include cardiac failure due to afterload
imbalance
if
the
circuit/oxygenator
has
supraphysiologic
resistance, or the potential for high-output cardiac failure if the
oxygenator has subphysiologic resistance. Most attempts have
been
limited
by
subphysiologic
circuit
flows
and
rapid
haemodynamic decompensation despite the use of vasopressor
support and other measures24,25,44,46. Recently, Miura et al.45
reported survival of lamb fetuses on a pumpless parallelized
circuit up to a predetermined limit of 60 h. In this report,
the
animals
remained
relatively
haemodynamically
stable.
However, external flow regulators were required to reduce
blood flow through the circuit to reverse lactic acidosis, and
evidence of white matter brain injury was observed on histology.
Most investigators have added pumps to arteriovenous systems to
address the limitation of subphysiologic flow in pumpless
systems7–9,11–15. While most attempts have been short-lived
culminating in circulatory failure, prolonged survival of up to
543 h was achieved in two fetal goats12. However, to achieve
this result, the animals required dialysis, continuous paralysis,
were hydropic and ultimately succumbed to respiratory failure.
Hollow fibre plate technology has allowed the development of
near-zero-resistance oxygenators, enabling our pumpless system.
In contrast to previous studies, throughout the development of
our system, we saw no instances of cardiac failure in our
developmentally relevant lambs (105 days of gestation and
beyond). In fact, a low level of resistance developed across the
circuit when umbilical vascular access was used, consistent with
some autoregulation of blood flow.
A
major
concern
in
premature
infants
is
intracranial
haemorrhage, raising concern for the use of anticoagulation in
extracorporeal support systems. We use substantially reduced
heparin
doses
compared
with
conventional
extracorporeal
membrane oxygenation (ECMO) to maintain activated clotting
times in the 150–180 s range. We attribute our reduced heparin
dosage to the reduced surface area of our circuit and the inclusion
of a heparin-bound coating to all of the blood contacting
components. In the future there will likely be non-heparin-based
coatings that will further improve safety. However, there is also
evidence that germinal matrix haemorrhage is related to positive
pressure ventilation, inotrope use47 and other interventions in
the extreme premature infant48. Thus, physiologic support in
a extracorporeal system without ventilation or pressors may, in
itself, reduce the likelihood of haemorrhage, making prediction of
the impact of our system on intracranial haemorrhage difficult.
A critical feature of our system is the closed fluid environment
with continuous fluid exchange. This has many advantages, the
most important of which is preservation of fluid-filled lungs and
the normal glottic resistance required for maintenance of normal
airway pressures and lung growth and development5,19. In
addition, a fluid environment maintains the protective barrier
between the fetus and the outside world. Finally, fetal swallowing
of amniotic fluid helps maintain fetal fluid homeostasis and
potentially may provide an additional route for nutrition.
Although we used a simple electrolyte solution in this study,
amniotic
fluid
contains
many
trophic
factors
and
other
components
that
may
be
beneficial
to
the
fetus.
The
development of an optimal ‘amniotic fluid’ for use in the device
is an important focus of our current research. Continuous fluid
exchange is employed to remove waste and maintain sterility and
is analogous to the physiologic turnover of amniotic fluid. The
rate of fluid exchange can be increased to clear any contamination
that occurs and we have not had any clinically significant
infections since development of the Biobag. Disadvantages of
a fluid environment include limited access to the fetus by
caregivers (that is, physical examination, blood draws, haemo-
dynamic monitoring) with contamination of the environment if

 such access is required, and lack of rapid access in the case of an
emergency. In our system, we can examine the fetus in great
detail by ultrasound that is superior to physical examination, and

purposes are included, and we have designed a clinical device that
could be rapidly opened should the fetus need to be resuscitated.

 An additional disadvantage that has been raised is parental
perception of having their fetus in a ‘bag’. It is important to
consider that the comparator is the extreme premature infant on
a ventilator and in an incubator. We feel that parents will be
relatively reassured that their fetus is being maintained in
a relatively protective and physiologic environment. The clinical
device will be designed with many features that should allow the
parent to be connected with the fetus including ultrasound,
a darkfield camera allowing real-time visualization of the fetus
within its darkened environment and the ability to play maternal
heart and abdominal sounds to the fetus. We therefore feel that
the advantages far outweigh the disadvantages of exposure of the
fetus to the conventional care imposed on the critically preterm
infant in the neonatal intensive care unit environment.
Finally, the umbilical cord offers the only physiologic vascular
access for extracorporeal support for the fetus. The use of carotid

 arterial inflow or any other peripheral artery does not provide
normal placental flows. In addition, all other access sites require
an operative procedure on the fetus for both insertion and
removal of cannulas, require stabilization of cannulas to avoid
catastrophic
decannulation
events
and
raise
concern
for
compromise of blood flow to the brain or other structures,
depending upon the vessel utilized. While many investigators
have utilized the umbilical vessels, most have placed their
cannulas into the central vasculature to avoid umbilical vascular
spasm7,8,11–15,23–25,45,46. This is possible in sheep or goats, but
not possible and would likely be hazardous for arterial cannula
placement in the human fetus due to the tortuous course of the
umbilical arteries and the large cannulas required. In contrast, we
sought to take advantage of the natural resistance of the umbilical
cord to occlusive events by developing an ‘end adapter’ design for
our umbilical cannulation incorporating very short cannulas and
a method for securing the cannulas to the umbilical cord. This
avoids irritation of the vasculature or turbulence of flow at the
end of the cannulas that might induce vascular spasm, erosion,
aneurysm formation or thrombosis. It also allows a length of free
umbilical cord between the cannulas and the fetus, preventing
concern regarding decannulation or positional occlusion. As
a result, we have been able to eliminate sedation during our runs
and to maintain much more stable flows.
An alternative approach to AV pumped or pumpless systems has
recently been developed that utilizes veno-venous ECMO with circuit
inflow via the external jugular vein and circuit outflow via the
umbilical vein. They report support of extreme premature lambs in
relatively stable physiologic condition for up to 1 week49–51 with
average circuit flows of 87.4±17.9mlkg� 1min� 1. They also report
the requirement for vasopressors for the first 3 days, sedation
throughout the run and findings of closure of the ductus venosus on
necropsy, with the development of ascites and pleural effusions. In
addition, five of nine lambs died before 1 week due to catheter-related
complications or arrhythmia. In contrast to our closed fluid
environment,
an
amniotic
fluid-filled
endotracheal
tube
is
maintained that would not be expected to replicate the normal
airway dynamics of fetal breathing. With further development, the
veno-venous ECMO system may offer an alternative for support of
premature infants, particularly after vaginal delivery as a salvage for
ventilatory failure49.
Clinical application of the technology will require further
scientific and safety validation, and evolution and refinement of
the device itself. While we report here the application of our
system to biologically equivalent premature lambs, the 105-day
fetal lamb is considerably larger (1.0–1.5 kg) than an extremely
low
birth
weight
premature
infant.
In
pilot
studies
on
size-equivalent but developmentally far less mature lambs
(85–95-day GA, 480–750 g), we encountered no limitations
related to umbilical vessel caliber or oxygenator flows, confirming
the technical feasibility of UA/UV cannulation at this size
(Supplementary Movie 5). We did see evidence of too much flow
(300–350 ml kg � 1 min � 1) in our very early gestational, human-
size-equivalent lambs resulting in hydrops and limiting our
experiments to 5 to 8 days. In contrast to the more mature and
developmentally equivalent lambs, no evidence of autoregulation
of circuit flow was observed. This suggests that there is a delicate
balance between adequate and excessive circuit flow and that the
ability to compensate for increased flow and supraphysiologic
right atrial pressures may be dependent on developmental
maturity. As the weight-adjusted cardiac output and umbilical
arterial size are nearly identical between the fetal lamb and
humans, we anticipate the ability to place 8–10 Fr cannulas into
human umbilical vessels. We have developed cannulas for rapid
insertion and anticipate the ability to cannulate a human
umbilical cord and initiate circuit flow in o2 min that is well
within the window of time that is critical for fetal brain
oxygenation52. This would, at least initially, be done via
a modified ‘EXIT’ procedure53 in the 50–60% of extreme
preterm deliveries that can be anticipated and delivered by
caesarean section54. The requirement for an EXIT procedure will
require centre expertise and introduce additional risk and
potential
long-term
hysterotomy-related
morbidity
for
the
mother and these risks will need to be incorporated into

 nondirective counselling before the procedure. The ability to
place an infant on the system after vaginal delivery, or to clear
contamination under that circumstance, or circumstances of
chorioamnionitis, remain to be experimentally determined, but
would remain a possibility if umbilical vascular spasm can be
prevented or reversed and contamination can be contained and/
or fetal infection treated.
The initial clinical target population for this therapy will likely
be the 23–25-week extreme premature infant. At the present time
the morbidity and mortality of this population would seem to
justify general application of this technology if it were proven
to dramatically improve outcomes in clinical trials. Future
developments may allow better prediction of those infants who
are destined for extreme premature delivery55 and may allow
genetic prediction of infants who are most at risk for mortality
and morbidity if born premature56,57. This would in turn
allow risk stratification of potential patients and improved
selection of patients who would be most likely to benefit.
An important point is that placement on the system would
not be prohibitive to standard therapies for extreme premature
infants. For instance, prenatal glucocorticoids could still be
administered, and rapid delivery from the system and conversion
to standard premature neonatal care would be necessary and
warranted if the system failed. Before 22–23 weeks of gestation,
there are likely physiologic and technical limitations that will
increase the risk and reduce the potential benefit of this therapy.
Our goal is not to extend the current limits of viability, but rather
to offer the potential for improved outcomes for those infants
who are already being routinely resuscitated and cared for in
neonatal intensive care units. Finally, the implications of this
technology
extend
beyond
clinical
application
to
extreme
premature
infants.
Potential

applications
may
include
treatment
of
fetal
growth
retardation
related

insufficiency
or
the

of

infants
threatening to deliver after fetal intervention or fetal surgery.
The technology may also provide the opportunity to deliver
infants affected by congenital malformations of the heart, lung
and diaphragm for early correction or therapy before the
institution of gas ventilation. Numerous applications related to
fetal pharmacologic, stem cell or gene therapy could be facilitated
by removing the possibility for maternal exposure and enabling
direct delivery of therapeutic agents to the isolated fetus. Finally,
our
system
offers
an
intriguing
experimental
model
for
addressing fundamental questions regarding the role of the
mother and placenta in fetal development. Long-term physiologic
maintenance of a fetus amputated from the maternal–placental
axis has now been achieved, making it possible to study the
relative contribution of this organ to fetal maturation.

 Methods
Surgical procedure. Time-dated pregnant ewes were used at gestational ages of
104 to 135 days (term is B145 days). Animals were treated according to approved
protocols by the institutional animal care and use committee of The Children’s
Hospital of Philadelphia Research Institute.
Ewes were anaesthetized with 15 mg kg � 1 of intramuscular ketamine, with
maintenance of general anaesthesia with inhaled isoflurane (2–4% in O2) and
propofol (0.2–1.0 mg kg � 1 min � 1). Intraoperative haemodynamic monitoring
included pulse oximetry, with a constant infusion of isotonic saline administered
via a central venous line placed in a jugular vein to maintain maternal fluid balance.
A lower midline laparotomy was created to expose the uterus, with a small
hysterotomy performed to expose the fetal sheep head and neck (CA/JV) or
umbilical cord (UA/UV). Experimental lambs undergoing cannulation of the neck
vessels (CA/JV and CA/UV) underwent creation of a small right neck incision to
expose the jugular vein and/or carotid artery. Fetuses received one intramuscular
dose of buprenorphine (0.005 mg kg � 1). After determination of the maximal
cannula size accommodated by each vessel, ECMO cannulae were placed
(8–12 Fr, Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA), with stabilizing sutures placed along
the external length of cannulae at the neck. Cannulas were customized with
a silicone sleeve over the external portion of the cannulas to permit increased
tension of the stabilizing sutures in CA/JV and CA/UV experiments. Experimental
lambs undergoing cannulation of the umbilical vessels were positioned to expose
the umbilical cord, with connective tissue sharply dissected to expose the umbilical
arteries and veins. Umbilical cannulae were placed in one umbilical vein (CA/UV)
as well as two umbilical arteries (UA/UV) (12 Fr, Medtronic, or modified 8–12 Fr
custom-made cannulas), with stabilizing sutures placed at the insertion sites.
Following construction and blood priming of the oxygenator circuit as
described below, connection of the cannulas to the circuit was performed under
continuous ultrasonographic visualization of the fetal heart. Occlusion of the
umbilical cord was performed immediately following establishment of blood flow
through the circuit, with administration of additional blood volume in a subset of
animals (CA/JV) demonstrating poor cardiac filling immediately after

 establishment of circuit flow. Subsequently, fetal lambs were weighed and
transferred to a sterile fluidic incubator for further management as described.
To generate baseline data of the ovine fetus in utero, two time-dated pregnant
ewes at 118 days of GA underwent laparotomy for implantation of fetal vascular
catheters and electrodes41. Insulated multi-stranded stainless steel wire ocular
EMG electrodes were implanted subcutaneously in the superior and inferior
margins of the muscle overlying the orbit of one eye41. Briefly, after induction of
general anaesthesia and exteriorization of the fetus, catheters were implanted in the
fetal carotid artery and jugular vein, in addition to a reference catheter placed in the
amniotic sac, followed by placement of EMG wire electrodes as described above.
Fetal catheters and electrodes were exteriorized through the maternal flank, and the
uterus and abdomen were closed. Following a 48–72 h recovery period, ewes were
transferred to a holding cage for fetal monitoring. Monitoring of catheterized fetal
lambs in utero was started 48–72 h after surgery and continued in 24 h intervals on
alternating days until completion of the experimental protocol at 140 days of GA.
Fetal ocular EMG (1,000 Hz) and arterial pressures (400 Hz) corrected for amniotic
fluid pressure were continuously recorded (LabChart 5, ADInstruments Inc.,
Colorado Springs, CO, USA).
Circuit. The pumpless circuit consisted of a low-resistance hollow fibre oxygenator
(Quadrox-ID Pediatric Oxygenator, Maquet) connected to ECMO cannulae
(Medtronic) or custom-made umbilical cannula via 3/160 ID� 1/160 wall thickness
BIOLINE-coated tubing (Maquet). In later studies utilizing smaller lambs, a smaller
oxygenator was utilized (Quadrox-ID Neonatal Oxygenator, Maquet). Connections
were established as an arterial–venous extracorporeal oxygenation circuit, with the
carotid artery or umbilical arteries providing inflow to the oxygenator (CA/JV or UA/
UV) connected to the oxygenator inflow port and the jugular vein or umbilical vein
(CA/JV or UA/UV) providing outflow from the oxygenator and connected to the
oxygenator outflow port. Total priming volume was 81ml of maternal blood
for the large oxygenator and 38ml for the smaller oxygenator. Circuit flow was
continuously measured (HT110 Bypass Meter and HXL Tubing Flowsensor,
Transonic Systems Inc., Ithaca, NY, USA) and sweep gas supplied to the oxygenator
was a blended mixture of medical air, nitrogen and oxygen titrated to achieve fetal
blood gas values (target PaO2 20–30 mmHg, target PaCO2 35–45mmHg).
Fluid incubation. The first CA/JV studies were performed in a 30-litre heated
stainless steel reservoir filled with sterile synthetic amniotic fluid (‘still reservoir’,
pilot study), later expanded to a 40-litre polycarbonate tank with continuous
recirculation of fluid through a series of sterile filters. Subsequent fluidic incubators
were based on a model of continuous exchange of warmed sterile fluid
(temperature 38.5–40.5 �C), with inflow tubing mounted on a double-head
peristaltic pump and gravitational outflow to facilitate continuous fluid turnover.
Fetal lamb enclosures within this system included a 60-litre customized glass tank
(CA/JV series one) (NDS Technologies, Vineland, NJ, USA), and individually
customized bag enclosures of 2- to 4-litre total volume initially comprised
silver-based antimicrobial polyethylene film (CA/UV and UA/UV studies)
(Wiman Custom Films & Laminates, Sauk Rapids, MN, USA) and later the
same film without silver impregnation. Synthetic amniotic fluid was composed
of a balanced salt solution containing Na þ (109 mM), Cl � (104 mM),
HCO3 � (19 mM), K þ (6.5 mM), Ca2 þ (1.6 mM), pH 7.0–7.1, osmolarity
235.8 mOsm kg � 1 water. The rate of fluid inflow (HT110 Bypass Meter and
HXL Tubing Flowsensor, Transonic Systems Inc.) and internal fluid temperature
(MLT415/A, ADInstruments) were monitored continuously.
Fetal lamb maintenance on circuit. Following stabilization and transfer of animals
to the fluid incubator, a continuous infusion of heparin (10–400 USP units per hour)
and prostaglandin E1 (0.1mg kg� 1 min� 1) were administered intravenously.
Heparin dosing was titrated to reach a target activated clotting time of 150–180 s.
Arterial and venous blood were analysed every 1–8 h for blood gas, electrolyte and
coagulation values (i-Stat System, Abbott Point of Care Inc., Princeton, NJ, USA) and
oxygen saturation (Avoximeter 1000E, Accriva Diagnostics, San Diego, CA, USA).
Stored whole maternal blood was transfused as required (10–20 ml kg� 1) to
maintain fetal Hgb levels above 9 g dl� 1. In a subset of lambs (Prototype IV
lambs 4–6), erythropoietin (400 U kg� 1) was administered intravenously once daily
to promote fetal erythropoiesis, and was held for Hgb 416g dl� 1.
Analgesics (buprenorphine, 0.005 mg kg � 1 intravenously every 3–5 h as
needed) and anxiolytics (propofol, 0.1–0.5 mg kg � 1 min � 1) were administered
during periods of perceived fetal agitation (restless repetitive fetal movements,
excessive swallowing, tachycardia and hypertension). This was primarily required
in the CA/JV and CA/UV animals with markedly reduced sedation requirement in
the UA/UV animals.
Total parenteral nutrition was administered throughout the duration of fetal
incubation as described: (CA/JV: amino acids (TrophAmine 10%, 3.5 g kg � 1 per
day), lipids (Intralipid 20%, 2–3 g kg � 1 per day) and dextrose (10.0–12.5 g kg � 1
per day) to a total caloric goal of 80 kcal kg � 1 per day; CA/UV: amino acids
(TrophAmine 10%, 3 g kg � 1 per day), lipids (Intralipid 20%, 1–2 g kg � 1 per day
for lambs 1–3, and 0.1–0.2 g kg � 1 per day for lambs 4 and 5), dextrose (titrated to
blood glucose target 30 mg dl � 1) and iron (1 mg kg � 1 per day); UA/UV: amino
acids (TrophAmine 10%, titrated to blood urea nitrogen target level 30 mg dl � 1),
lipids (Intralipid 20%, 0.1–0.2 g kg � 1 per day), dextrose (titrated to blood glucose
target 30–40 mg dl � 1)and iron (1.0–1.5 mg kg � 1 per day, titrated to plasma iron
target 200–300 mg dl � 1)).
Cardiac ultrasound was performed one to two times daily by a fetal
echocardiographer. Measured parameters included right ventricular (RV)/left
ventricular (LV)/combined cardiac outputs (CCO), ductus arteriosus flow and
proximal right pulmonary artery pulsatility index. Control echocardiography data
were obtained in pregnant anaesthetized ewes at 109 days and 135 days of GA.
Data acquisition and formulas. Fetal blood pressure, heart rate, circuit blood flow
rates, transmembrane pressure differential, sweep gas flow and incubator fluid
temperature were continuously recorded (LabChart 7, ADInstruments Inc.).
Post-membrane oxygen content ¼ (1.34 � Hgb � post-membrane oxygen
saturation) þ (0.0031 � post-membrane PaO2).
Pre-membrane oxygen content ¼ (1.34 � Hgb � pre-membrane oxygen
saturation) þ (0.0031 � pre-membrane oxygen PaO2).
Weight-adjusted circuit flow ¼ absolute circuit flow/estimated daily weight.
Oxygen delivery (ml kg � 1 min � 1) ¼ weight-adjusted circuit flow � post-
membrane oxygen content.
Oxygen consumption (ml kg � 1 min � 1) ¼ weight-adjusted circuit flow � (post-
membrane oxygen content � pre-membrane oxygen content).
Oxygen extraction (%) ¼ (oxygen consumption/oxygen delivery) � 100%.
Estimated daily weight. Growth rate was assumed to be exponential and derived
from measured body weight at the start and end of each run (according to the
formula y ¼ aebx, where ‘a’ is starting weight and ‘b’ is growth rate in g kg � 1 per
day). Estimated daily weights (for weight-adjusted calculations) were extrapolated
from the exponential growth rate calculated for each lamb.
Control growth rate. Initial body weights (at time of delivery from uterus) of
Prototype III/IV experimental lambs and late-gestation control lambs were plotted
against gestational age. Exponential regression analysis was used to determine
control growth rate in utero as well as the estimated fetal weight for the expected
biparietal diameter calculations.
Decannulation and mechanical ventilation. Following completion of the
incubation period, animals were transitioned from the fluid bath, with endotracheal
intubation and suctioning to remove excess fluid from the lungs. Surgical
decannulation of the carotid artery and/or jugular vein (CA/JV, CA/UV) was
performed under general anaesthesia with inhaled isoflurane (2–4% in O2) and
propofol (0.2–1.0 mg kg � 1 min � 1). Patent umbilical vessels were clamped and
divided (CA/UV, UA/UV and control lambs). One umbilical artery or carotid
artery was catheterized to enable blood gas measurement. Anaesthesia was then
reversed and animals were maintained on mechanical ventilation with intermittent
arterial blood gas sampling using an i-Stat System (Abbott Point of Care Inc.).
A group of normally grown control lambs (N ¼ 4) were delivered via hysterotomy
at 140–141 days of GA, arterial and venous cannula placed for serial blood
sampling and fluid/drug administration, respectively, orally intubated and
ventilated.
Lambs were maintained on synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation,
with FiO2 titrated to PaO2 460–80 mm Hg, peak inspiratory pressure titrated
to tidal volume 6–8 ml kg � 1 body weight, respiratory rate titrated to pH 7.4
(if possible) and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) maintained between
5 and 7 mm Hg. The general goal was to wean ventilator support, and hence lambs
were sedated only as needed to optimize respiratory performance, and were often
allowed to breathe spontaneously in addition to receiving mandatory ventilator-
triggered breaths. Arterial blood gases were obtained every 1–4 h to assess
pulmonary gas exchange function.
We could not reliably quantify the degree to which spontaneous, unsupported
breaths contributed to oxygenation index (OI ¼ (FiO2 � mean airway pressure)/
PaO2) and ventilation efficiency index (VEI ¼ 3,800/(peak inspiratory
pressure � respiratory rate � PaCO2)), and hence absolute values of OI and VEI
were invalid measures for comparing pulmonary function between lambs in this
study. We used relative OI and VEI calculations to determine which blood gas
values (at given ventilator settings) corresponded to each animal’s ‘peak’
oxygenation and ventilation (lowest OI was point of peak oxygenation, and highest
VEI was point of peak ventilation). Peak oxygenation and ventilation did not
necessarily occur at the same time point.
Post-mortem. Body, brain and lung weights were recorded. The lungs were
inflation fixed (30 cm H2O) via the trachea with 10% formalin. When the fixation
pressure had reached a plateau, typically within 20 min, the trachea was occluded
and the lungs were submerged in buffered fixative stored at room temperature for
7–10 days. Brains were submerged in 10% formalin for 7–10 days.
Stereological analysis. Lung volume (VL) was estimated using the water
displacement58. Two sections of lung tissue were obtained from the lower lobes,
dehydrated through a series of graded alcohol solutions, embedded in paraffin,
sectioned at 3 mm and stained with haematoxylin and eosin. Lung images
(N ¼ 10 per animal) devoid of major airways and blood vessels were visualized
using a Toshiba 3CCD camera interfaced with a Leica DMRD microscope and an

 Apple G4 computer. A transparent multipurpose test lattice consisting of 216 test
points and a discontinuous series of line probes was placed over the screen images.
The number of test points overlying tissue, and number of line probe intercepts
with the luminal surface were used to calculate lung tissue fraction and luminal
surface density (SV) respectively. Luminal surface area of the lungs (SL) was
calculated according to the equation: SL ¼ SV � VL. Septal wall thickness (TW) was
calculated according to the following equation: TW ¼ Vpa,tiss/SL; where Vpa,tiss is
parenchymal tissue volume25,26.
Histologic analysis and myelin quantification. Post-therapy and control brain
tissues were sectioned into anterior and posterior regions for each hemisphere.
Haematoxylin and eosin and Kluver and Barrera Luxol fast blue staining was
performed as detailed in ‘Laboratory Methods in Histotechnology’ (Armed Forces
Institute of Pathology, Washington, DC)38,39. Slides were digitally scanned at
20 � magnification and evaluated using both Aperio Imagescope Version 12.3
(Leica Biosystems Pathology Imaging, Buffalo Grove, IL, USA) and standard light
microscopy. Individual gyri were digitally measured at maximum width on each
slide. Myelin analysis and the calculation of myelin-positive pixel ratios was
performed using Positive Pixel Count Version 9 (Aperio Technologies, Leica
Biosystems) A uniform algorithm adjusted to identify pixels consistent with
positive staining was applied to experimental and control slides. Maximum
positivity by region was determined by limiting density analysis to multiple areas
1 mm2 in size where the Luxol fast blue staining was strongest40.
Statistical analysis. Haemodynamic parameters (heart rate, mean pre-membrane
pressure and circuit flow) and arterial blood gas parameters were averaged over
12 and 24 h, respectively, and analysed using one within-group (time) and one
between-group (treatment) analysis of variance. When significant differences
between means were detected, multiple comparison analysis was performed using
least significant difference test (SPSS Version 23, IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA).
Epithelial SP-B cell density, biparietal diameter, brain-to-body weight ratios,
myelination density and fetal breathing responsiveness to PaCO2 were compared
using Student’s unpaired t-test (SPSS). Body weight data were fitted to nonlinear
regression curves, the rate constants of which were analysed between groups
(GraphPad Prism Version 6, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA).
