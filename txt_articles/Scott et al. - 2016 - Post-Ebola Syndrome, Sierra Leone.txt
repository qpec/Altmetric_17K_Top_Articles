 Thousands of persons have survived Ebola virus disease. 
Almost all survivors describe symptoms that persist or de-
velop after hospital discharge. A cross-sectional survey of 
the symptoms of all survivors from the Ebola treatment unit 
(ETU) at 34th Regimental Military Hospital, Freetown, Si-
erra Leone (MH34), was conducted after discharge at their 
initial follow-up appointment within 3 weeks after their sec-
ond negative PCR result. From its opening on December 
1, 2014, through March 31, 2015, the MH34 ETU treated 
84 persons (8–70 years of age) with PCR-confirmed Ebola 
virus disease, of whom 44 survived. Survivors reported 
musculoskeletal pain (70%), headache (48%), and ocular 
problems (14%). Those who reported headache had had 
lower admission cycle threshold Ebola PCR than did those 
who did not (p<0.03). This complete survivor cohort from 
1 ETU enables analysis of the proportion of symptoms of 
post-Ebola syndrome. The Ebola epidemic is waning, but 
the effects of the disease will remain.
T
housands of persons have now survived Ebola virus dis-
ease (EVD). During efforts to control the current Ebola-
Zaire outbreak, attention has focused on containing spread 
of infection and improving survival. In Sierra Leone, 4,051–
5,115 persons are confirmed to have survived from among 
8,704 confirmed cases and 3,589 confirmed deaths (1).
Survivors report a range of sequelae loosely described 
as post-Ebola syndrome. Follow-up clinics were not al-
ways planned as part of the emergency response. However, 
survivors from the Ebola treatment unit (ETU) at the 34th 
Regimental Military Hospital (MH34), Wilberforce Bar-
racks, Freetown, Sierra Leone, were all followed up in an 
outpatient clinic within 2 weeks after discharge. Although 
resources to care for survivors, including basic equipment 
(e.g., adequate stethoscopes), were scarce, each survivor 
was seen by a physician who made contemporaneous struc-
tured notes, which afforded an opportunity to document 
post-Ebola syndrome during these first weeks.
What proportion of Ebola survivors have sequelae is not 
clear. Little is known about post-Ebola syndrome or whether 
it is an entity distinct from an appropriate response to the 
traumatic events of EVD. Abdominal pain, vision loss, hear-
ing loss, impotence, bleeding, psychological problems, and 
general weakness were listed qualitatively as symptoms of 
post-Ebola syndrome after the Ebola-Sudan outbreak in 
Uganda in 2000 (2). Arthralgia and ocular diseases were 
noted in 19 survivors (selected according to availability) 
who were followed up after the 1995 Ebola-Zaire outbreak 
in Kikwit (3,4); in the same outbreak, arthralgia, myalgia, ab-
dominal pain, extreme fatigue, and anorexia were more com-
mon in Ebola survivors than in their household contacts (5). 
From the current outbreak, survivors reported arthralgia and 
anorexia (which in this context includes loss of appetite with-
out weight loss) in a telephone-administered questionnaire in 
Guinea several months after discharge (6). Because none of 
these studies comprised an unselected cohort of survivors, 
interpretation of proportions was difficult. Other reports 
referred to anecdotes of pain, weakness, difficulty hearing, 
and mental disturbances (7,8). These observations suggest 
complaints that might be expected. Descriptions of the pro-
portions of survivors needing care for the most common 
problems are needed to plan health care for the thousands 
of survivors. We report the symptoms described by all EVD 
survivors from 1 ETU in the initial weeks after discharge.
Methods
The MH34 ETU can accommodate 30 persons with con-
firmed EVD plus 20 persons with suspected EVD; it also 
contains a doffing area. MH34 opened on December 1, 
2014, with 115 staff, including 3 physicians and catered to 
patients who fell ill in western Freetown and surrounding 
areas. The ETU admitted 355 patients (84 PCR-positive pa-
tients) and discharged 44 survivors during December 2014–
March 2015. The area for persons with confirmed EVD is 
a permanent building with several 1–4-bed rooms that have 
electric lighting and ceiling fans. Three hot meals per day 
are provided, generally rice with protein, such as fish or 
chicken; each meal is provided with 2 bags of water, and 
more water is freely available. Staff members of this small 
ETU are all permanent Sierra Leonean healthcare workers.
Patients were admitted to the confirmed Ebola ward 
when Ebola virus (EBOV) infection was confirmed by real-
time PCR. For some patients, a cycle threshold (Ct) result 
also was available. Although Ct results were not standard-
ized between PCR platforms or between laboratories, a low

 RESEARCH
Ct reflects a high viral load. Patients were staged on arrival 
to the ETU, as follows:
•  
Stage 1: influenza-like illness (i.e., fever, myalgia. 
lethargy, fatigue, headache, sore throat, conjuncti-
val injection).
•  
Stage 2: multisystem features, including “wet” gastro-
intestinal symptoms (vomiting, diarrhea), neurologic 
symptoms (headaches, confusion), vascular symptoms 
and signs (capillary leak, respiratory distress, hypoten-
sion), rash.
•  
Stage 3: internal and external bleeding, multiorgan 
failure.
Patients were treated for Ebola with supportive care 
(9). Antimicrobial drugs were administered empirically, 
and artesunate, paracetamol, and 500 mL intravenous 
Ringer’s lactate were administered on arrival. Ongoing 
treatment included further boluses of intravenous fluid; an-
tiemetic medication and proton pump inhibitors were ad-
ministered in accordance with clinical need. Some patients 
participated in a compassionate use open nonrandomized 
study of a single unit of convalescent whole blood (CWB), 
results of which are pending.
Discharge criteria were as follows: 2 consecutive neg-
ative PCR results for Ebola virus on separate days; medical 
fitness, in the opinion of his/her physician; and adequate 
social provisions, including release of the house and house-
hold members from quarantine. During the convalescent 
period, many patients ate >1 serving of each meal, 3 time 
per day. Although they were not routinely weighed, most 
patients visibly gained weight.
On leaving the ETU, all survivors were issued a sur-
vivor’s certificate and invited to a follow-up appointment 
within 2 weeks after discharge. Some survivors were seen 
before this appointment because of clinical need.
Contact with survivors was maintained by mobile 
phone. Confirmation of identification has not proved prob-
lematic because the survivors and healthcare workers had 
come to know each other well. Appointments are made by 
mobile phone and unscheduled visits by patients to the hos-
pital. All survivors attended their follow-up visits. Patients 
were examined by 1 of 3 experienced physicians.
A follow-up appointment was established as a stan-
dard of care in this ETU from the outset at the height of 
the epidemic. Handwritten clinical notes documented 
presenting complaints, symptoms, and signs. These notes 
were subsequently used to develop appropriate preprinted 
clinical documentation. Age, sex, presenting complaints, 
and history of transfusion with CWB were noted for each 
patient. Preexisting conditions were rare in this cohort of 
patients and not included in this data extraction. At that 
time, facilities and equipment for survivors were limited; 
for example, all stethoscopes had been incinerated; blood 
pressure cuffs, ophthalmoscopes, and specialist opinions 
were not available.
Data Analysis
We determined 95% CIs and conducted hypothesis testing 
of binomial outcomes (binomial frequency test) continu-
ous outcomes (Mann-Whitney U) and analyzed them using 
Stata version 9 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA). 
Graphics were produced by using Stata version 9 and R 
version 3.1.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vi-
enna, Austria).
Results
Demography
During December 1, 2014–March 30, 2015, the MH34 
ETU treated 84 persons with PCR-confirmed EVD. Of 
these, 44 (52%) survived; 23 were female, and patient 
ages were 8–70 years (median 35 years; interquartile range 
[IQR] 20–37 years); age was not documented for 1 patient 
(Figure 1; Table 1).
Acute EVD Episode
Information about the acute EVD episode was available for 
12 (27%) of the 44 survivors. Sex and ages of these 12 sur-
vivors did not differ significantly from those of the full set. 
For these 12 persons, median length of ETU stay was 15.5 
days (range 9–17 days, IQR 13.5–16.6 days). For the 11 
survivors for whom Ct results were available, median Ct at 
ETU admission (admission Ct) was 28 (range 23–37, IQR 
23–31). Two patients were admitted in clinical stage 1 and 
9 in clinical stage 2. 
Twenty-three (52%) survivors received CWB. Ages of 
survivors receiving transfusions did not differ significantly 
from those of survivors who did not (p = 0.8). The frequencies 
of symptoms did not differ significantly between survivors

who received CWB and those who did not (p = 0.5). Our 
study was not designed to assess efficacy or toxicity of CWB.
Post-Ebola Syndrome Complaints
At the time of data extraction, each survivor had attended 
at least 2 appointments. All survivors had >1 post-Ebola 
complaint (median 2, maximum 5). A total of 117 separate 
complaints were reported: 31 (70% [95% CI 55%–83%]) 
patients had musculoskeletal pain, 21 (48% [95% CI 32%–
63%]) had headaches, and 6 (14% [95% CI 5%–27%]) had 
ocular problems.
In their initial follow-up appointment, patients who 
reported headache had had admission Ct results that were 
significantly lower (correlating to a higher viral load) than 
those who did not subsequently report headache (with head-
ache: n = 6, median Ct 24 [IQR 23–28]; without headache: 
n = 5, median Ct 31 [IQR 30–31]; p<0.03 by Mann-Whit-
ney U test) (Table 2; Figure 2). There was no significant 
difference in admission Ct or clinical stage, or length of 
stay in the ETU for acute Ebola or clinical stage, between 
patients who had ocular problems or musculoskeletal pain 
and those who did not (Table 2; Figure 2). 
One patient died after deteriorating respiratory symp-
toms and left-sided pleural effusion. He was a 25-year-old 
man in whom EVD was diagnosed on January 26; he re-
ceived supportive care and 1 unit of CWB. His first nega-
tive PCR result was on February 8 and his confirmatory 
negative test on February 11; he was discharged home. At 
his 14-day follow-up visit, he had weight loss, cough, and 
dyspnea on exertion. At his second outpatient appointment, 
he was admitted to the general medical ward of MH34 
on March 3 with left-sided pleural effusion. A pleural tap 
yielded only a small quantity of blood-stained fluid that 
was insufficient for analysis. He died on March 8, 2015, 
one month after his recovery from acute EVD. In adher-
ence to safe-burial policy, a postmortem examination was 
not performed. His diagnosis remains unclear, but postvi-
ral effusion is possible, with tuberculosis pleural effusion a 
differential diagnosis.
Musculoskeletal Pain
Because in our experience and in the local context the dis-
tinction between myalgia and arthralgia can be physician-
dependent, we merged these complaints. However, for the 
purpose of comparisons with other studies, we determined 
that 12 (27% [95% CI 15%–42%]) of the 44 survivors had 
arthralgia, 15 (34% [95% CI 20%–50%]) had myalgia, and 
4 (9% [95% CI 3%–22%]) had both (Table 3). We found no 
significant differences between the proportion of male and 
female survivors, or between children (<18 years of age) 
and adults, who had musculoskeletal pain.
Patients described musculoskeletal pain various-
ly as problems with walking or moving or pain specific 
to 1 area (such as knees, thighs, or back) or generalized 
musculoskeletal pain. (21%–52%). Most often, patients

characterized their musculoskeletal pain as a general pain 
rather than pain in a specific joint or area, as reflected in 
the recorded symptoms. Unspecified joint pain accounted 
for 14 of the 19 times joint pain was recorded (73% [95% 
CI 49%–90%]) and generalized body pain for 8 of the 19 
times body pain was recorded (42% [95% CI 20%–67%]). 
Some patients recorded >1 symptom.
Examination indicated no joint inflammation or ef-
fusion, such as might be expected in a reactive condition, 
and patients retained full range of movement. Functional 
disability ranged from mild to moderate. For example, 1 
man in his 20s continues to play football but now takes ac-
etaminophen to facilitate this activity. A woman in her 40s 
requires assistance to step into a bath and cannot continue 
normal household work; she walked unaided into the clinic 
but needed assistance to step up into the clinic room and to 
sit and stand. Most of her musculoskeletal symptoms are 
relieved by simple analgesics.
Headache
Of the 21 (48% [95% CI 32%–63%]) survivors who re-
ported having headache, 2 (10% [95% CI 1%–30%]) were 
girls 8 and 11 years of age. The proportion of male and 
female survivors reporting headaches did not differ sig-
nificantly (p = 1 by χ2 test). Headache was generally de-
scribed as affecting the full head, with no diurnal pattern 
and being constant. Ocular symptoms might coincide, but 
no visual phenomena, such as might be found in migraines, 
were reported.
Ocular Symptoms
Among the 6 (14% [95% CI 5%–27%]) survivors who 
reported ocular problems, symptoms were eye pain, 
clear discharge, red eyes, and blurred vision (Table 4). 
These symptoms appeared within 2 weeks after dis-
charge and were not present at or before ETU discharge. 
Eye discharge was treated with topical chloramphenicol. 
Ophthalmology services for survivors are currently un-
der development.
Combinations of Musculoskeletal Pain, Headache,  
and Ocular Problems
Musculoskeletal pain and headache overlapped substan-
tially. Eighteen (58% [95% CI 40%–75%]) of the 31 sur-
vivors with musculoskeletal pain reported headache, and 
18 (86% [95% CI 64%–97%]) of the 21 survivors with 
headache reported musculoskeletal pain. Two (6% [95% 
CI 1%–21%]) survivors with musculoskeletal pain report-
ed ocular problems, and 2 (33% [95% CI 4%–78%]) with 
ocular problems reported musculoskeletal pain. Two (6 
% [95% CI 1%–30%]) survivors with headache reported 
ocular problems. One survivor had all 3 complaints (i.e., 
3% [95% CI 1%–17%] of survivors with musculoskeletal 
pain; 5% [95% CI 0%–24%] of those with headache, and 
17% [95% CI 0%–64%] with of those with ocular prob-
lems) (Figure 3).

Other Symptoms
Twenty-six (59% [95% CI 43%–74%]) of the 44 survivors 
reported other symptoms. Five (11% [95% CI 4%–25%]) 
reported cough; 4 (9% [95% CI 3%–22%]) each reported 
abdominal pain, chest pain, or itching; 3 (7% [95% CI 1%–
19%]) each reported insomnia, fever, or loss of appetite; 
2 (5% [95% CI 1%–15%]) each reported labored speech, 
epigastric pain, or rash; and 1 (2% [95% CI 0%–12%]) re-
ported weight loss, hiccups, increased appetite, chest pain, 
sneezing, diarrhea, vomiting, left sided weakness with fa-
cial nerve palsy, breathlessness, rash, dry flaky skin, ear-
ache, fever blister/cold sore, left scrotal swelling, nasal 
congestion, and tremors (Table 5).
Discussion
We documented symptoms of EVD survivors in the initial 
3 weeks after negative Ebola virus PCR results and 2 weeks 
after ETU discharge. The dominant clinical features of this 
survivor cohort were musculoskeletal pain, headache, and 
ocular problems. Symptoms did not differ by survivor sex 
or age. Symptoms did not appear to be affected by use of 
CWB to manage acute EVD; however, this finding should 
be interpreted with caution because this report is not a pro-
spective study and not designed to consider the effect of 
CWB on post-Ebola syndrome. Whether this collection of 
signs and symptoms after acute EVD constitutes a separate 
syndrome might be semantic. Because experience of survi-
vors in the weeks after EVD, although varied, has common 
features, we propose that the term post-Ebola syndrome is 
useful to describe these phenomena.
Our findings are consistent with some aspects of pre-
vious reports (2,5) but vary from others. For example, the 
prevalence of extreme fatigue and anorexia reported in 
Kikwit and Guinea (5,6) was not dominant in the cohort 
reported here. This finding might be due to the period of 
inpatient convalescence of survivors at MH34 with sub-
stantial nutritional support.
We hypothesize that the pathogenesis of pain, particu-
larly muscle pain, is a sequelae of widespread myositis or 
rhabdomyolysis during acute EVD. This hypothesis would 
be consistent with laboratory data reporting raised trans-
aminases and disseminated intravascular coagulation from 
a previous outbreak of Ebola (10) in Sudan. Future research 
would benefit from a comparison of a survivor cohort with 
a matched group who had not had Ebola and, if this pain is 
more common in Ebola survivors (as was found in Kikwit 
[5]), further elucidation of its etiology would be useful in 
determining treatment strategies.
Post-Ebola syndrome includes, but is not restricted 
to, musculoskeletal pain, headache, and ocular problems. 
Because some complications occur weeks or months after 
acute onset of EVD, some symptoms might be underesti-
mated in this cohort (2,5). Since these data were extracted, 
clinical facilities and documentation has improved, so future 
information is likely to be more detailed in terms of spe-
cific diagnosis, and scope, particularly in regard to psycho-
social health and ophthalmology. Previous outbreaks have 
reported psychosocial problems (2), although they are not 
included in all reports (5). Psychosocial problems also were 
evident in the survivors in our study but not captured in the 
documentation. Improved collaboration with MH34’s men-
tal health team should improve both the care and documenta-
tion. Anecdotal evidence from the survivors’ clinic suggests 
that more subtle neurologic problems, such as specific nerve 
palsies, might feature more heavily in a follow-up study.
Survivors who reported headache had had lower Ct re-
sults than did those who did not. Although patients with 
higher initial viral loads might be more likely to have cen-
tral nervous system involvement, and then have a higher 
probability of headache as a post-Ebola sequelae; Ct values 
are not standardized among platforms or laboratories. This 
intertest variability, together with the small sample sizes 
in this data extraction, suggests any association should be 
interpreted with caution. We propose that this association 
warrants further investigation. Headaches could also repre-
sent ongoing tension headaches or might result from under-
lying undiagnosed changes in vision.
We would expect the criteria and definition of  post- 
Ebola syndrome to continue to develop and that the sur-
vivors will continue to face fresh challenges. During the 
height of the Ebola epidemic, when these consultations 
took place, resources and equipment for assessing survivors 
were limited. Our survey documents symptoms only in the 
first 3 weeks after ETU discharge. Subsequent follow-up 
might be more detailed and benefit from increased resourc-
es, and symptoms continue to develop with time. Indeed, 
Ebola virus can cross the blood–brain barrier during the 
acute illness (11) and persists in some compartments for 
several months (12). Areas for development include com-
parison of symptoms to community controls, psychosocial

problems, causes of ocular problems and musculoskeletal 
pain, and longitudinal description of the clinical picture.
Because musculoskeletal pain is a common complaint 
in the general population in Sierra Leone, a community-
controlled comparison is needed. In survivors of the Kik-
wit Ebola-Zaire outbreak in 1995, Rowe et al. reported 
that their key features—arthralgia, myalgia, abdominal 
pain, fatigue, and anorexia—were more common in survi-
vors than in household contacts, whereas fever, headache, 
diarrhea, dyspnea, hiccups, and hemorrhage were the 
same in both groups (5). A topic for future research is the 
longitudinal course of recovery. Wendo et al. (2) reported 
that 1 year after the Ebola-Zaire outbreak in Uganda, 25% 
of patients were still reporting to clinic. Therefore, we can 
expect some survivors to have long-term clinical needs. 
The epidemic is waning but the effects of the disease it 
caused will remain.
