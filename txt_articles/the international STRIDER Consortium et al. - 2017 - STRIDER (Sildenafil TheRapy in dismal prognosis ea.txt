Abstract
Background: Severe, early-onset fetal growth restriction due to placental insufficiency is associated with a high risk
of perinatal mortality and morbidity with long-lasting sequelae. Placental insufficiency is the result of abnormal
formation and function of the placenta with inadequate remodelling of the maternal spiral arteries. There is
currently no effective therapy available. Some evidence suggests sildenafil citrate may improve uteroplacental blood
flow, fetal growth, and meaningful infant outcomes. The objective of the Sildenafil TheRapy In Dismal prognosis
Early onset fetal growth Restriction (STRIDER) collaboration is to evaluate the effectiveness of sildenafil versus
placebo in achieving healthy perinatal survival through the conduct of randomised clinical trials and systematic
review including individual patient data meta-analysis.
Methods: Five national/bi-national multicentre randomised placebo-controlled trials have been launched. Women
with a singleton pregnancy between 18 and 30 weeks with severe fetal growth restriction of likely placental origin,
and where the likelihood of perinatal death/severe morbidity is estimated to be significant are included.
Participants will receive either sildenafil 25 mg or matching placebo tablets orally three times daily from
recruitment to 32 weeks gestation.
Discussion: The STRIDER trials were conceived and designed through international collaboration. Although the
individual trials have different primary outcomes for reasons of sample size and feasibility, all trials will collect a
standard set of outcomes including survival without severe neonatal morbidity at time of hospital discharge. This is
a summary of all the STRIDER trial protocols and provides an example of a prospectively planned international
clinical research collaboration. All five individual trials will contribute to a pre-planned systematic review of the topic
including individual patient data meta-analysis.

 Background
An estimated 0.4% of pregnancies worldwide are compli-
cated by severe early-onset (<28 weeks gestation) fetal
growth restriction (FGR) caused by placental insuffi-
ciency.
This
patient
group
utilises
disproportionate
amounts of obstetric care and has a high likelihood of
premature birth, both for fetal and for secondary mater-
nal indications such as the development of the maternal
syndrome of pre-eclampsia. As these growth-restricted
infants
are
usually
born
very
preterm,
they
carry
additional significant risks of major and minor neonatal
morbidity, and long-term health sequelae if they survive.
These risks are not only related to gestational age at
birth, but also to the degree of FGR. Survival propor-
tions for severely growth-restricted fetuses very remote
from term (<28 weeks’ gestation) vary between 7 and
33% [1–3] and less than one third of these fetuses will
survive their neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) stay
without significant neurodevelopmental sequelae [4].
The diagnosis of early onset FGR is often missed but
even when diagnosed based on growth parameters below
the normal range (<10th, <5th, or <3rd centile) with or
without
evidence
of
abnormal
fetal
and
maternal
Doppler waveforms there are currently no specific
evidence-based therapies available. Non-specific inter-
ventions may include lifestyle modifications such as
reducing or stopping work, stopping aerobic exercise,
rest at home, and hospital admission for rest and
surveillance. These interventions are used in the belief
that rest will reduce the steal from the utero-placental
circulation to the glutei and quadriceps muscles but are
not based on any good quality evidence. In the absence
of proven therapeutic interventions, standard clinical
management
consists
of
counselling,
intensive
monitoring, and timely delivery once a fetus has reached
a viable gestation and size but often results in extreme
preterm birth.
Doppler waveform analysis of pregnancies complicated
by severe FGR suggests compromised utero-placental
circulation
and
placental
hypo-perfusion
[5,
6].
Sildenafil, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, potentiates the
action of nitric oxide thus causing vasodilatation [7]. It
is therefore possible that sildenafil may affect utero-
placental circulation and perfusion resulting in improved
gaseous and nutrient exchange and improved fetal
growth and well-being. Animal and preclinical studies
support this concept [8–13].
Although the number of women using sildenafil in
pregnancy is low, it is increasingly used in pregnancy for
maternal cardiac indications with no reports of adverse
maternal or fetal effects [14–21]. In a small randomised
clinical trial in women with early onset pre-eclampsia,
sildenafil use had no demonstrable effect on prolonga-
tion of pregnancy, but provided further reassurance on
drug safety profile in pregnancy [16]. Sildenafil has been
used in a small cohort of women in the setting of early
onset FGR. In an observational study by STRIDER col-
laborators in Vancouver, Canada, there was a tendency
towards more live-born children with survival intact to
primary discharge for women treated with sildenafil
when compared to women with pregnancies at similar
risk but not receiving sildenafil [17]. From the limited
observations to date there are no concerns of adverse
maternal, fetal, neonatal, or infant effects associated with
sildenafil use in pregnancy [14–21].
On the basis of this preliminary research, some centres
have already adopted treatment with sildenafil [18, 19].
However, there is no clear evidence of true health bene-
fits and, more significantly, potential harm has not yet
been excluded. Use of sildenafil for other indications in
clinical
trials
and
in
post-market
reporting
has
highlighted adverse drug reactions including headache,
flushing, nasal congestion, and impaired vision and, rare,
serious consequences such as myocardial infarction,
arrhythmias, and stroke [7]. More specific to pregnancy
and FGR, sildenafil’s vasodilatory properties may cause a
transient decrease in blood pressure with potential to
adversely affect the most at risk fetuses (those with
absent or reversed end diastolic
flow
on Doppler
waveform analysis), via a reduction in critical utero-
placental flow or by a direct effect on fetal vasculature.
Prolonging pregnancy in FGR has the potential to shift
the survival curve but will not necessarily have the same
positive impact on short term outcomes and long term
well-being.
Well-designed,
appropriately
powered
randomised
placebo-controlled
trials
are
required
before implementation into clinical practice should be
considered.
The overarching hypothesis of this collaboration of
clinical trials is that sildenafil citrate compared with
placebo will improve fetal growth and wellbeing, allowing
prolongation of pregnancy leading to a decrease in the
rate of fetal and neonatal mortality and severe morbidity.
Methods/design
Design of the trials
Randomised placebo-controlled trials in New Zealand/
Australia, Canada, Ireland, the Netherlands, and the
United Kingdom including participants during 2014 to
2020. Trials are independently funded and executed and
will be independently reported but all will contribute to a
prospectively
planned
systematic
review
including
individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis [22]. Each trial
is prospectively registered New Zealand and Australia:

 Setting
Clinical trials are taking place in tertiary care centres in
New
Zealand/Australia,
Canada,
Ireland,
the
Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. A single trial
management service hosted at the University of British
Columbia, Canada, is being used by each trial and pro-
vides a randomisation service and electronic data collec-
tion system. IPD meta-analysis and systematic review
will be performed by a trial and systematic review
service unit in Denmark, The Copenhagen Trial Unit.
Participants
Pregnant women referred to tertiary care referral centres
for evaluation and management of severe early-onset
FGR at gestational ages <30 weeks.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Individual trial inclusion and exclusion criteria are
shown in Table 1. The differing inclusion criteria
between individual trials allow for variations in feasibil-
ity, local standards, and investigator choice.
Ethics and informed consent
All
trials
have
obtained
appropriate
local
ethics
approvals. All participating women are provided with
written and verbal information regarding the trial they
are going to enter and provide signed informed consent
in advance of participation. Any protocol modifications
once the trials are underway will be reviewed by the
local Ethics Committee. Appropriate clinical trial insur-
ance is in place for participants of each trial in the event
that any participants experiences harm as a consequence
of participation in these trials.
Randomisation
R programming statistical software was used for generat-
ing the allocation lists. The R package blockrand func-
tion was modified to allow for varying numbers of
strata. For each trial an allocation list was generated for
each level of stratification variable. Each allocation list
had a length of sample size +20%. Block sizes used are
specific to each individual trial.
Experimental and control interventions
Participants will receive oral sildenafil 25 mg or matching
placebo tablets (table 1) three times daily from randomisa-
tion until delivery, fetal demise, or 32 weeks gestation
(whichever occurs first). Participants, researchers, dispens-
ing pharmacists, clinicians and outcome assessors will
remain unaware of treatment allocation for duration of
trial. All other interventions will be provided according to
local practice. Treatment code may be revealed in event of
a serious adverse event where the responsible clinician
deems this information to be crucial to provide on-going
safe clinical care.
Sample size estimation
Assumptions for sample size estimations were made on
the basis of clinical relevance, local audit, and a pilot
cohort [17]. Investigators for each individual trial made
their own estimations, based on the choice of primary
outcome and the following variables:
The New Zealand/Australian STRIDER trial has a pri-
mary outcome of fetal growth velocity determined by
abdominal circumference (AC) growth velocity. Using
data from the pilot cohort [17] to estimate a difference
of 50% in placebo-treated versus 80% in sildenafil-
treated
of
pregnancies
with
an
increased
post-
randomisation AC growth velocity, 58 women will be
randomised per group, (two-sided α of 0.05 and 90%
power to detect this difference). Allowing for a 5% drop-
out rate, the total sample size will be 122 women.
Three of the STRIDER trials have a primary outcome
relating to the interval between randomisation and birth.
In the UK STRIDER and Irish STRIDER trials, 1 week
(7 day) difference in mean randomisation and birth
interval is considered to be clinically important. Internal
audits of early-onset FGR cohorts revealed an average
diagnosis-delivery interval of 20 days with standard
deviation of 11 days. In order to confirm or refute that
sildenafil can prolong pregnancy by 1 week compared
with placebo, 52 women will be randomised per group
in each trial (two-sided α of 0.05 and 90% power to
detect this difference). Allowing for a 5% drop-out rate,
the total sample size will be 112 women in each trial.
Based on local pilot cohort experience, the Canadian
STRIDER trial assumes a 16-day difference in mean
gestational age at delivery, 189 days (placebo-treated)
and 205 days (sildenafil-treated) [17]. 41 women will be
randomised per group (two-sided α of 0.05 and 80%
power to detect this difference). Allowing for a 10%
drop-out rate, the total sample size will be 90 women.
The Dutch STRIDER trial has a primary outcome of
intact infant survival until hospital discharge. Assuming
a 29% (placebo-treated) and 44% (sildenafil-treated)
proportion
of
intact
infant
survival
until
hospital
discharge, 161 women will be randomised per group
(two-sided α of 0.05 and 80% power to detect this differ-
ence). Allowing for a 10% drop-out rate, the total sample
size will be 354 women.
Outcomes
Primary outcomes of individual trials are summarised in
Table 1. Individual trials have different primary out-
comes but all trials collect a standard set of outcomes
and apply the same definition for each outcome to
ensure compatibility for future analysis.

 Independent data monitoring and safety committees
All individual trials have their independent data safety
monitoring committees and interim analyses of trial data
are planned in some individual trial protocols. Individual
trial data monitoring and safety committee charters can
be freely accessed [28–32]. An umbrella international
data safety monitoring board has been established to
provide oversight for all STRIDER trials and will review
trial sequential data analysis after the completion of each
trial once two trials have been completed.
Type of analyses
Independent blinded data analysis at the completion of
each individual trial will occur on an intention-to-treat
basis: that is, for the purpose of analysis, all women will
be included in the group to which they have been rando-
mised. Pre-planned subgroup analysis will occur within
some individual trials including; assessment of the effect
of low placental growth factor (PlGF) at inclusion,
umbilical artery Doppler waveform analyses at inclusion
(presence or absence of forward flow), and for the effect
of other baseline parameters such as gestational age,
estimated fetal weight, and participating centre.
Ancillary and follow-up studies
Each individual trial has ancillary studies underway. These
include the effect of sildenafil on: maternal peripheral
blood angiogenic factors, myometrial and placental vascu-
lature, maternal haemodynamics, and neonatal cardiac
function. Local bio-banking of placental tissue and/or
umbilical cord blood is also planned in some trials.
Childhood outcome studies are proposed to assess the
important longer-term outcomes of infants born to
mothers participating in the STRIDER trials. This will
include assessment of neurodevelopmental, cardiovascu-
lar, and metabolic outcomes. Assessment at 2–3 years of
age
is
already
funded
or
partially
funded
in
the
Netherlands and Ireland. Further funding applications
are pending.

Discussion
The STRIDER
trials
were
conceived
and
designed
through international collaboration. The trials are com-
petitively funded at a national level by government
funded research agencies within each country. Each
individual trial protocol was developed independently by
local groups of investigators but all trial designs are
similar and all outcomes will be collected in all trials.
Each trial will be conducted autonomously, but in close
co-operation across the six countries involved. There is
a
central
trial
management
service
hosted
at
the
University of British Columbia, Canada, providing a
central randomisation service as well as a central
electronic data collection system for each trial. The
randomisation service and data collection systems have
been designed collaboratively and, although each trial
will use its own independent randomisation service and
data collection systems these shared resources have
reduced overall trial costs and will ensure data compati-
bility for future analysis in the prospectively planned
IPD meta-analyses.
The research teams for all STRIDER trials have regular
communication via e-mail, teleconferencing, face-to-face
meetings, and a newsletter. Collaboration between the
groups is strong with all teams committed to securing
funding for long-term infant and childhood outcome
studies. These data will contribute to further the system-
atic review and IPD meta-analysis.
The STRIDER trials are all conducted in order to
reduce bias by employing central, stratified randomisa-
tion; blinding of all parties through use of matching
placebos; central data management focusing on few
missing data and dropouts; blinded drawing of conclu-
sions; transparent uploading of IPD data after the trials
have been published; no involvement of the pharmaceut-
ical industries selling the product; as well as planning for
systematic review of all trials including meta-analyses of
individual patient data. These bias eliminating or redu-
cing actions have all been conducted to minimize any
risks of systematic errors, that is overestimation of
benefits and underestimation of harms [33–40].
The STRIDER trials have all calculated their sample
sizes taking into consideration a projected drop-out rate.
This gives sample sizes that are inflated according to the
assumed
risks.
We
acknowledge
this
methodology
should no longer be undertaken as there is now
international consensus to analyse data with multiple
imputation [41, 42]. Such analyses will be used for the
individual trials, however, we have not amended the
sample size calculations as the projected drop-out is
small in all trials.
In medicine, a single randomised clinical trial is
unlikely to be able to change clinical practice [38].
Therefore, the STRIDER trials have from inception been
planned to be systematically reviewed together with any
other randomised trials addressing the same topic [22].
Furthermore, in order to better evaluate benefits and
harms, the STRIDER trials are planned to be included
alone or together with any other trial providing data into

 individual patient data meta-analyses [22]. The STRIDER
Consortium is presently writing up a detailed statistical
analysis plan for the systematic review and individual
patient data meta-analyses.
The STRIDER Collaboration will ensure the assess-
ment of sildenafil use for the treatment of early onset
FGR occurs in a safe and timely manner and should
ensure sildenafil is only introduced into clinical practice
if reliable data on safety and efficacy supports its use.
The extensive IPD data will also provide opportunities
to broaden our knowledge of severe early onset FGR,
and to explore other applications for sildenafil use if
safety and efficacy are established.
