 INTRODUCTION
Cancer is one of the leading causes of 
death in developed countries, with over 
163 000 cancer deaths in the UK in 2014.1 
The commonest route to cancer diagnosis 
follows the development of symptoms, and 
definitive diagnosis by biopsy and access 
to specialist care often rely on a primary 
care physician to recognise the possibility 
of cancer
. It is generally accepted that delay 
in symptomatic diagnosis is harmful.2,3 
One feature of possible cancer has only 
recently been recognised to have diagnostic 
potential: a raised platelet count, or 
thrombocytosis. 
Thrombocytosis is present in 1.5–2.2% of 
the primary care consulting population aged 
≥40 years.4–6 A recent systematic review 
summarised the evidence from previous 
primary care studies.7 Four case-control 
studies reported associations between 
thrombocytosis in primary care and a 
future diagnosis of lung, renal, uterine, and 
colorectal cancer
.4–6,8 A further four primary 
care studies found that thrombocytosis was 
not predictive of pancreatic, breast, ovarian, 
or oesophagogastric cancer.9–13 Revised 
UK national guidance for suspected 
cancer incorporates thrombocytosis in 
some of its recommendations for lung, 
oesophagogastric, and uterine cancers.2 
However, 
no 
study 
has 
examined 
thrombocytosis in primary care for all 
cancers. This study aimed to address that 
gap. 
METHOD
Data sources
This prospective cohort study used data 
from the UK Clinical Practice Research 
Datalink (CPRD) (www.cprd.co.uk), which 
holds anonymised electronic primary care 
records from roughly 8% of UK practices. All 
patients’ consultations, laboratory results, 
and referrals are available in numerical 
coded format. Linked data from the English 
Cancer Registry were obtained for all 
patients. The data linkage was carried out 
by a third party, the Health and Social Care 
Information Centre, now known as NHS 
Digital (https://digital.nhs.uk/).
Patient sample
The cohort was a random sample of 50 000 
patients who had had a primary care full 
blood count taken. Within this there were two 
sub-cohorts: patients with thrombocytosis 
and patients with a normal platelet count.
The thrombocytosis sub-cohort included 
40 000 patients selected using four criteria: 
• a 
platelet 
count 
of 
>400 × 109/L, 
henceforth labelled ‘thrombocytosis’;
• no previous thrombocytosis;
• aged 
≥40 years 
at 
the 
time 
of 
thrombocytosis; and
• the thrombocytosis event was recorded 
from 2000 to 2013 inclusive.
In the CPRD, only the year of birth is 
available (to protect anonymity), so an

Abstract
Background
Thrombocytosis (raised platelet count) is 
an emerging risk marker of cancer, but the 
association has not been fully explored in a 
primary care context.
Aim
To examine the incidence of cancer in a cohort 
of patients with thrombocytosis, to determine 
how clinically useful this risk marker could be in 
predicting an underlying malignancy.
Design and setting
A prospective cohort study using Clinical Practice 
Research Datalink data from 2000 to 2013.
Method
The 1-year incidence of cancer was compared 
between two cohorts: 40 000 patients aged 
≥40 years with a platelet count of >400 × 109/L 
(thrombocytosis) and 10 000 matched patients 
with a normal platelet count. Sub-analyses 
examined the risk with change in platelet count, 
sex, age, and different cancer sites.
Results
A total of 1098 out of 9435 males with 
thrombocytosis were diagnosed with cancer 
(11.6%; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 11.0 to 
12.3), compared with 106 of 2599 males without 
thrombocytosis (4.1%; 95% CI = 3.4 to 4.9). A total 
of 1355 out of 21 826 females with thrombocytosis 
developed cancer (6.2%; 95% CI = 5.9 to 6.5), 
compared with 119 of 5370 females without (2.2%; 
95% CI = 1.8 to 2.6). The risk of cancer increased 
to 18.1% (95% CI = 15.9 to 20.5) for males and 
10.1% (95% CI = 9.0 to 11.3) for females, when a 
second raised platelet count was recorded within 
6 months. Lung and colorectal cancer were 
more commonly diagnosed with thrombocytosis. 
One-third of patients with thrombocytosis and 
lung or colorectal cancer had no other symptoms 
indicative of malignancy. 
Conclusion
Thrombocytosis is a risk marker of cancer in 
adults; 11.6% and 6.2% cancer incidence in 
males and females, respectively, is worthy of 
further investigation for underlying malignancy. 
These figures well exceed the National Institute 
for Health and Care Excellence-mandated risk 
threshold of 3% risk to warrant referral for 
suspected cancer

Clinical relevance of thrombocytosis in primary care: 
a prospective cohort study of cancer incidence using English electronic medical 
records and cancer registry data 
e405  British Journal of General Practice, June 2017
 arbitrary date of birth of 1 July was assigned, 
leading to the exclusion of 25 patients 
nominally aged <40 years. Patients with a 
platelet count >1000 × 109/L were excluded 
because some extreme values were 
biologically implausible; others potentially 
represented platelet malignancies. The index 
date was defined as the date of the patient’s 
first raised platelet count. Patients with 
cancer before the index date were excluded. 
The second (comparison) sub-cohort 
was matched to a random selection of 
10 000 patients from the thrombocytosis 
sub-cohort. Patients selected for blood 
testing are inherently different from the 
untested population and more likely to have 
an underlying condition. Therefore patients 
with a normal platelet count were a superior 
comparator to the general consulting 
population. Matching was by age (within 
5 years), sex, and practice. Comparison 
patients also had a platelet count from 2000 
to 2013 inclusive and their first platelet count 
in that time was in the ‘normal’ range of 
150–400 × 109/L, although they could have 
thrombocytosis subsequently. The index 
date for these patients was their platelet 
count nearest in time to the index date of 
their matched comparator
. Because this 
index date was sometimes later than their 
first normal platelet count, 374 (3.7%) of 
these had thrombocytosis at their index 
date, and were excluded. 
Power calculations indicated that 40 000 
patients with thrombocytosis was sufficient 
to estimate an incidence of cancer of 5% 
with a margin of error no greater than 
0.22%, using the upper bound of the 
95% confidence interval (CI), and 10 000 
patients was sufficient to estimate the same 
incidence of cancer with a margin of error 
no greater than 0.45% similarly.
Outcome variables
All new cancer diagnoses (excluding non-
melanoma skin cancer, which is commonly 
under-reported in the cancer registry) in the 
2 years after the index date were identified 
by searching electronic patient records for 
any of 2134 cancer-related codes (available 
from the authors on request). This list of 
cancer codes has been used in several 
studies, and is collated into 22 common 
cancer sites, plus a miscellaneous group. 
The reasons for blood tests being ordered 
were unknown; however, the 12 symptoms 
most frequently recorded for patients in 
each cohort in the month before their blood 
test were reported (Appendix 1).
New cancer diagnoses were also 
extracted from the cancer registry records. 
Patients were included as having a cancer 
diagnosis if one was recorded in either the 
CPRD or the cancer registry. The earliest 
record of cancer in either the CPRD or 
the registry was assigned the diagnosis 
date. Stage at diagnosis was determined 
from registry data. Early-stage cancer was 
defined as either stage I or stage II, and late-
stage cancer as either stage III or IV. 
Statistical methods and analysis
Analyses were stratified by sex throughout. 
The primary analysis reported the 1-year 
cancer incidence as a percentage (and 
95% CIs) for patients with thrombocytosis 
and normal platelet count. For the 
thrombocytosis cohort this is equivalent 
to the positive predictive value (PPV) of 
thrombocytosis for cancer. The specific 
site of the cancer diagnosis was identified 
from the electronic records. Where more 
than one cancer was diagnosed, the first 
recorded cancer site was used. The time 
between first thrombocytosis and any cancer 
diagnosis was determined. The results were 
stratified by 10-year age bands. Where a 
second platelet count was recorded within 
6 months of index date, the risk of cancer 
was estimated depending on whether 
the second value showed an increase or 
decrease in platelet count. 
Patients diagnosed within 3 months 
of thrombocytosis may well have already 
entered diagnostic pathways, so potentially 
have less to benefit from thrombocytosis 
‘triggering’ investigation. In contrast, 
expedition of diagnosis by >3 months may 
yield considerable survival benefit. Therefore, 
a secondary analysis examined two 
How this fits in
Thrombocytosis has previously been 
identified as a marker of some types 
of cancer (lung, colorectal, renal, and 
uterine), but not all sites have been 
studied, and the effects of age, sex, and 
change in platelet count over time have 
not been examined. This is the first study 
to estimate the overall risk of cancer in 
patients with thrombocytosis. The positive 
predictive value of thrombocytosis is 11.6% 
(95% confidence interval [CI] = 11.0 to 12.3) 
for males and 6.2% (95% CI = 5.9 to 6.5) for 
females. This rises to 18.1% (95% CI 15.9 
to 20.5) for males and 10.1% (95% CI 9.0 to 
11.3) for females if the patient has a second 
raised platelet count within 6 months. 
These figures are well above the 3% 
threshold used by the National Institute for 
Health and Care Excellence for suspected 
cancer investigation, and strongly suggest 
that cancer should be considered in 
patients showing thrombocytosis. 
British Journal of General Practice, June 2017  e406
 subgroups: those diagnosed 4–12 months, 
and those diagnosed 13–24 months after 
thrombocytosis. 
Of the patients in the main cohort 
diagnosed with lung or colorectal cancer 
(the two most common cancer sites 
diagnosed), the study sought to examine 
the proportion with recorded symptoms 
that matched the contemporary National 
Institute for Health and Care Excellence 
(NICE) suspected cancer referral guidance,2 
and the proportion with no cancer symptoms 
other than thrombocytosis.
All analyses were performed using Stata 
(version 13). The reporting of this study 
conforms to the STROBE statement.14
RESULTS
After exclusions, the thrombocytosis cohort 
included 31 261 patients (Figure 1); the 
median age was 67.9 years (interquartile 
range [IQR] = 57.1 to 78.1 years), and 21 826 
(69.8%) were female. The normal platelet 
count cohort included 7969 patients; the 
median age was 68.3 years (IQR = 58.1 to 
78.5 years) and 5370 (67.4%) were female.
Cancer diagnoses 
There were 1098 cancers diagnosed within 
1 year of thrombocytosis in the sample 
of 9435 male patients, and 1355 in the 
sample of 21 826 female patients. This 
represents a 1-year cancer incidence of 
11.6% (95% CI = 11.0 to 12.3) for males and 
6.2% (95% CI = 5.9 to 6.5) for females; this 
is equivalent to the PPV of a raised platelet 
count. In patients with a normal platelet 
count there were 106 cancers diagnosed in 
males and 119 in females; a 1-year cancer 
incidence of 4.1% in males (95% CI = 3.4 
to 4.9) and 2.2% in females (95% CI = 1.8 
to 2.6) (Table 1). Approximately one-third of 
cancers in the thrombocytosis group were 
diagnosed at least 3 months after their index 
date (Table 1: 4–12 months). In the second 
year after index date, cancer incidence had 
returned to baseline levels (Table 1: 13–24 
months). The risk of cancer increased 
with increasing platelet count (Figure 2). 
Patients with thrombocytosis were at 
consistently greater risk than those with 
normal platelet counts across all ages; the 
difference in risk between those with and 
without thrombocytosis increased from age 
70 years. (Figure 3).
When patients had a second platelet 
count taken within 6 months of their 
first, the 1-year incidence of cancer was 
greatest in males whose next platelet count 
showed an increase in platelets or the same 
platelet count: 18.1% (95% CI = 15.9 to 25.2), 
or whose next platelet count decreased,

 but remained abnormally high: 19.1% 
(95% CI  = 16.5 to 20.5). For females, these 
two groups were also at the greatest risk 
of cancer: 10.1% (95% CI = 9.0 to 11.3) and 
7.3% (95% CI = 6.3 to 8.4), respectively.
Staging data were available for 1168 
of the 2453 cancers diagnosed in the 
thrombocytosis cohort. Of these, 575 (49.2%) 
were early stage and 593 (50.8%) were late 
stage. In the normal platelet count cohort, 
staging data were available for 123 of the 
225 cancers diagnosed. Of these, 77 (62.6%) 
were early stage and 46 (37.4%) were late 
stage. 
There were 2440 diagnoses recorded in 
the CPRD data (from either cohort) and 
3078 in the cancer registry data: 2136 of 
the 2440 CPRD-recorded diagnoses were 
validated by the cancer registry data (positive 
predictive value of 87.5%); 2136 of 3078 
cancer registry-recorded diagnoses were 
captured by the CPRD (sensitivity of 69.4%).

most commonly diagnosed cancers in the

 diagnosed in patients with thrombocytosis 
than in the general population, and breast 
and prostate cancer were much less 
commonly diagnosed (Figure 4). 
Symptoms accompanying thrombocytosis
The 12 most common symptoms reported in 
each group are shown in Appendix 1. There 
was little difference between the two cohorts 
in symptom reporting in the month before 
their blood test. Data on the different cancers 
is available from the authors on request. Of 
the 31 261 patients with thrombocytosis, 
573 were diagnosed with lung cancer; 
195 (35.7%) had no symptoms warranting 
urgent investigation as per NICE guidance, 
other than thrombocytosis. Similarly, 627 
of the 31 261 patients with thrombocytosis 
were diagnosed with colorectal cancer; 206 
(32.9%) had no symptoms in the year before 
diagnosis warranting urgent investigation 
for cancer
. The median number of days 
between thrombocytosis and diagnosis date 
was 50 for lung cancer (IQR = 18 to 126) and 
67 for colorectal cancer (IQR = 27 to 174). 
Thus, in at least one-third of all lung and 
colorectal cancer patients, thrombocytosis 
could potentially have triggered investigation 
in a patient hitherto not meeting current 
recommendations for referral.

 from primary care to report the overall risk 
of cancer in patients with thrombocytosis, 
compared with those with normal platelet 
counts. Males with thrombocytosis had an 
11.6% incidence of cancer in the following 
year, and females had an incidence of 
6.2%: this compares with 4.1% of males 
(95% CI = 3.4 to 4.9) and 2.2% of females 
(95% CI = 1.8 to 2.6) (Table 1) with normal 
platelet counts. The incidence of cancer rose 
with age and with a higher platelet count, 
and at least one-third of patients with lung 
and colorectal cancer with pre-diagnosis 
thrombocytosis had no other symptoms 
indicative of malignancy. 
Strengths and limitations
A key strength of this study is its size and 
setting in primary care, where the initial 
suspicion of possible cancer generally 
occurs. 
The inclusion of English Cancer Registry 
data is also a strength. These results rely 
on the accuracy of data in the CPRD. Recent 
publications have found fairly high levels of 
concordance between the CPRD and cancer 
registries: 83–92%.15,16 The percentage of 
total cancers identifiable from the CPRD 
alone in this study (69.4%) probably reflects 
the dataset ranging from 2000 to 2013, and 
the inclusion of any cancer type (except non-
melanoma skin cancer). Cancer recording 
in the CPRD has improved in recent years, 
and the inclusion of any cancer type (except 
non-melanoma skin cancer) the likely 
explanation for the superior figures above. 
Blood test results are electronically 
transmitted to patient records, reducing the 
likelihood of misclassification bias, although 
a small number of participants may have 
had previous thrombocytosis before joining 
their current CPRD practice. Registry 
staging data were incomplete; therefore, 
it is only possible to conclude that at least 
half of cancers diagnosed in patients with 
thrombocytosis were early stage and most 
likely to benefit from earlier diagnosis in 
terms of survival, though this proportion may 
be higher
. This result should be interpreted 
with caution, and further analysis was not 
attempted; the large amount of missing 
data suggests a bias in those patients for 
whom staging data are available. 
The symptoms preceding blood testing 
were reported by small, and similar, 
proportions of each cohort. Additionally, all 
are low-risk symptoms, which would not 
generally be expected to prompt urgent 
cancer investigation.2 It is unlikely that 
many of the blood tests carried out in 
the thrombocytosis group were triggered 
by a specific suspicion of cancer, as the 
symptoms were so similar between the 
groups. 
In primary care, blood tests are ordered 
for a wide range of reasons, rarely to test for 
thrombocytosis specifically; approximately 
one-quarter of the UK adult primary care 
population have a full blood count in any one 
year
.17 Patients who have had blood tests 
are expected to have more ill health than 
those who are not tested, thus a comparison 
cohort of patients with a normal platelet 
count was included, rather than a group 
with no testing at all. This should reduce (or 
eliminate) selection bias from patients being 
chosen for blood testing. This study does not 
report the value of measuring the platelet 
count in possible cancer; instead it reports 
the clinical usefulness of a thrombocytosis, 
which may be, and often is, a serendipitous 
finding in primary care. This is a subtle but 
real distinction.
Comparison with existing literature
Few 
studies 
have 
investigated 
the 
association between thrombocytosis and 
cancer in primary care. The results of this 
study agree with the four earlier single 
cancer site studies,4–6,8 three of which used 
the CPRD as a data source, although these 
three had different study designs from the 
current study and used different patients. 
Four further studies found no association 
between thrombocytosis and a later 
cancer diagnosis.9–11,13 These studies were 
examined in a recent systematic review.7
In secondary care, a study of patients 
with chest X-ray abnormalities suggesting 
possible lung cancer examined pre-
diagnostic 
platelet 
counts, 
finding 
thrombocytosis in 57% of patients with 
lung cancer and in 8% of those with 
benign lung disease.18 In primary care, the 
percentage of patients with lung cancer 
who had thrombocytosis is 14%, although 
this lower figure may arise from testing 
having been performed earlier in the 
diagnostic pathway when fewer patients 
are likely to have an underlying malignancy.5 
These two studies,5,19 plus results from 
the current study, suggest that in some 
patients with lung cancer the platelet count 
rises progressively in the months before 
diagnosis. This is supported by the finding 
that thrombocytosis was more common in 
patients with advanced disease.18 
There are three main theories underlying 
the association between platelets and 
cancer. In patients with ‘pre-existing’ 
thrombocytosis, 
tumour 
development 
may be augmented by platelet-released 
proangiogenic cytokines; platelets may 
shield tumour cells to promote metastasis;

and/or tumour-secreted cytokines may 
independently raise platelet counts.19 It is 
possible that all three of these processes 
can occur simultaneously in patients with 
thrombocytosis and underlying malignancy.
 
Implications for research and practice 
PPVs for cancer of 11.6% in males and 
6.2% in females are very high, and well 
above the threshold value of 3% risk used 
for urgent investigation of suspected cancer 
in recent UK guidance,2 and even further 
above the 1% figure that patients would 
choose.20 This analysis shows that only two-
thirds of patients had symptoms that would 
be recommended for urgent investigation 
in current NICE guidance; one-third had 
no relevant symptoms in the year before 
diagnosis, other than thrombocytosis. It 
is in this group that thrombocytosis has 
the greatest potential to prompt earlier 
diagnosis, where other symptoms have 
not yet developed. This strongly suggests 
that cancer should be considered when a 
result is received showing thrombocytosis, 
even if cancer was not initially suspected. 
The range of possible cancers is wide, 
so clinicians will probably have to seek 
additional features from the patient 
history and examination to select the most 
appropriate route for investigation. This 
analysis found that lung and colorectal 
cancers are more likely to be diagnosed 
in patients with thrombocytosis than in 
the general population, and breast and 
prostate cancers are less likely. The clinical 
situation differs from that of investigation 
for unprovoked thromboembolism, which 
remains controversial. This controversy 
follows a trial of alternative strategies for 
investigation of thromboembolism, with 
cancer yields of 3.2% in the limited testing 
group, and 3.9% in the extended testing 
group.21 The yield from investigation of 
thrombocytosis should be considerably 
higher
. 
To put these figures into context, the 
PPV of a breast lump in a female aged 
50–59 years in primary care is 8.5% 
(95% CI = 6.7 to 11.0%).10 Moreover, the 
PPVs with thrombocytosis are higher than 
summary PPVs in recent meta-analyses of 
primary care studies of haemoptysis and 
lung cancer (3.5%, 95% CI = 1.6 to 7.5 in 
over-40s).2 The PPVs with thrombocytosis 
are similar to those of hypercalcaemia, 
which has a male cancer 1-year incidence of 
11.5% and female cancer 1-year incidence 
of 4.1%.22 
From a patient perspective, these results 
may be of even more value. Thrombocytosis 
has not generally been viewed as a risk 
marker for cancer, at least until recent 
national guidance included it for lung, 
oesophagogastric, and uterine cancers.2 The 
results of this study show that substantial 
proportions of lung and colorectal cancer 
diagnoses could be expedited by at least 
2 months if thrombocytosis were to be 
routinely investigated. Based on findings 
from this study, even if only a conservative 
estimate of 5% of patients with cancer have 
thrombocytosis before diagnosis (16 500 out 
of 330 000 new cases annually in the UK), 
one-third of them have the potential to 
have their diagnosis expedited by at least 
3 months; this equates to 5500 earlier 
diagnoses annually.
