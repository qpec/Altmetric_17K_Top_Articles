urgical outcomes after coronary artery bypass grafting 
(CABG) vary significantly across hospitals in the United 
States, even after adjusting for case-mix differences.1,2 To 
reduce the variability in CABG outcomes, numerous qual-
ity improvement initiatives have been launched, including 
national and regional collaboratives,3,4 clinical pathways,5,6 
and pay-for-performance programs.7,8 Despite some encour-
aging results, unwarranted variation in CABG outcomes per-
sists. Critics suggest that part of the problem relates to the 
1-dimensional nature of these initiatives, which primarily 
target cardiac surgeons’ activities in the operating room and 
immediately after surgery.
However, there is growing recognition that CABG is 
not an individual game but rather a team sport, involving 
multiple physicians who work together before, during, and 
after surgery. Frequent interactions between these physician 
teammates around shared patients may influence their col-
lective performance.9,10 Specifically, as the number of their 
interactions increases, physician teammates will build trust 
and familiarity, be more likely to anticipate each other’s prac-
tice patterns, and establish preferred ways of communica-
tion. Such enhanced teamwork could have salutary effects on 
CABG outcomes, particularly downstream ones beyond the 
early perioperative period.
In this context, we analyzed national data from Medicare 
beneficiaries who underwent CABG. We used network ana-
lytic tools, in particular the bipartite clustering coefficient, to 
characterize the level of teamwork among cardiac surgeons 
and nonsurgeons in the health systems, where these proce-
dures were performed. We then compared surgical outcomes 
across health systems, stratifying by their teamwork level. 
Findings from our study serve to inform hospitals and health 
Background—Patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) must often see multiple providers dispersed 
across many care locations. To test whether teamwork (assessed with the bipartite clustering coefficient) among these 
physicians is a determinant of surgical outcomes, we examined national Medicare data from patients undergoing CABG.
Methods and Results—Among Medicare beneficiaries who underwent CABG between 2008 and 2011, we mapped 
relationships between all physicians who treated them during their surgical episodes, including both surgeons and 
nonsurgeons. After aggregating across CABG episodes in a year to construct the physician social networks serving 
each health system, we then assessed the level of physician teamwork in these networks with the bipartite clustering 
coefficient. Finally, we fit a series of multivariable regression models to evaluate associations between a health system’s 
teamwork level and its 60-day surgical outcomes. We observed substantial variation in the level of teamwork between 
health systems performing CABG (SD for the bipartite clustering coefficient was 0.09). Although health systems with 
high and low teamwork levels treated beneficiaries with comparable comorbidity scores, these health systems differed 
over several sociocultural and healthcare capacity factors (eg, physician staff size and surgical caseload). After controlling 
for these differences, health systems with higher teamwork levels had significantly lower 60-day rates of emergency 
department visit, readmission, and mortality.
Conclusions—Health systems with physicians who tend to work together in tightly-knit groups during CABG episodes 
realize better surgical outcomes. As such, delivery system reforms focused on building teamwork may have positive effects 
on surgical care.  (Circ Cardiovasc Qual Outcomes. 2016;9:641-648. DOI: 10.1161/CIRCOUTCOMES.116.002714.)

system leaders about the possible effects of healthcare reforms 
designed to foster physician team building—most notably 
the patient-centered medical home, bundled payments, and 
accountable care organizations—on surgical outcomes.
Methods
Data Source and Study Population
We began by identifying all beneficiaries aged 66 and older in the 
Medicare Provider Analysis and Review file who underwent CABG 
in the US hospitals between January 1, 2008 and December 30, 2011. 
Several considerations make CABG attractive for the purposes of 
our study. First, CABG is commonly performed on older adults, and 
the procedure always requires inpatient admission, helping to ensure 
its reliable identification in Medicare claims. Second, outcomes for 
CABG vary widely across health systems for reasons not attributable 
to differences in clinical risk. Third, the complexity of CABG typi-
cally demands the attention of multiple providers. As a result, rela-
tionships between primary care physicians (PCPs), noninvasive and 
interventional cardiologists, and cardiac surgeons may be especially 
important for shaping outcomes.
To ensure complete claims data, we required beneficiaries who 
had continuous enrollment in fee-for-service Medicare Parts A and 
B for a total of 6 months before and extending 60 days after their 
admission for surgery for inclusion in our sample. After identifying 
all beneficiaries who met these criteria, we then used the Medicare 
Provider Analysis and Review file to determine the hospitals, where 
their CABG was performed. These hospitals serve formally and in-
formally as anchors for outpatient clinics and other facilities that con-
stitute local health systems.
Mapping the Physician Teams That Serve the 
Health Systems Where Beneficiaries Are Treated
Next, we identified all physicians who participated in the care of these 
beneficiaries during their surgical episodes through paid claims in 
the Carrier, Medicare Provider Analysis and Review, and Outpatient 
files. We designated each beneficiary’s treating surgeon as the sur-
geon who billed for cardiac surgery services closest to the surgery 
date (available in the Medicare Provider Analysis and Review file). 
To determine each beneficiary’s PCP, we used the plurality algorithm 
described by Pham et al.11 To find care provided by other medical 
and surgical specialists, we constructed a time window that began 
30 days before and extended 60 days after the index admission. We 
excluded claims submitted by physicians who do not participate in 
direct patient care (eg, radiology) and those who have limited roles in 
perioperative management (eg, pathology).
We then aggregated across all CABG episodes at a given anchor 
hospital by calendar year, to construct CABG-specific, bipartite phy-
sician social networks. In brief, networks are collections of points (or 
nodes) connected together in series of lines (called ties).12 In social 
networks, the nodes represent individuals or groups of individuals 
within a particular social environment, and each tie connecting them 
denotes an interaction. For our bipartite networks, there were 2 sets of 
nodes (physicians and beneficiaries), and the ties connected one set of 
nodes to the other. We used these networks to represent the physician 
teams that serve each health system, where beneficiaries are treated.
Characterizing the Level of Physician Teamwork in 
a Health System
To characterize the level of physician teamwork in a given health sys-
tem, we calculated the bipartite clustering coefficient for its associated 
physician social network. The method for determining the bipartite clus-
tering coefficient is shown schematically in Figure 1. Mathematically, 
the coefficient was measured as 4×(M/S), where S is the number of phy-
sician pairs sharing a single patient (or more) in common and M is the 
number of physician pairs sharing multiple patients in common.13,14 We 
multiplied the ratio of M/S by 4 because each M contains 4 S configu-
rations. The number of M relationships indicates the extent to which 
physicians repartner with one another in the care of multiple patients.
The bipartite clustering coefficient summarizes the tendency for 
physicians in the network to assemble into dense, tightly-intercon-
nected groups (or cliques) around shared patients.12 In bipartite net-
works like ours, if the bipartite clustering coefficient is high, then 
many of the S relationships—connections formed when physicians 
share in the care of only 1 patient—are redundant, and therefore they 
reinforce existing relationships between physicians. The measure 
ranges from 0 to 1. Values closer to 1 indicate higher levels of cluster-
ing in the physician social network.
Clustering has long been used in the social sciences to explore the 
role of coordination, communication, and trust in teams.15–17 Social 
network theory suggests that highly clustered networks are more ef-
fective as information conduits because they improve the ability of 
collaborating physicians to share information and develop innovative 
protocols for treatment.18,19 To the extent that clustering promotes 
these different forms of teamwork, we hypothesized that it may also 
lead to improved surgical outcomes.
Assessing Surgical Outcomes
Our primary outcome measures were 60-day rates of emergency de-
partment (ED) visit, readmission, and mortality—all 3 of which are 
plausibly influenced by physician teamwork. We considered an ED 
visit, readmission, or death as having occurred if a patient was dis-
charged alive from the acute care hospital, where he underwent sur-
gery, and he was subsequently seen in the ED, readmitted at any acute 
care hospital, or died within 60 days from the date of discharge. We 
excluded from the readmission definition patients who were trans-
ferred to another hospital or to a rehabilitation facility at the time of 
initial discharge. We aggregated all outcomes for individual patients 
to the health system level to calculate rates per 1000 discharges.
Statistical Analysis
For all analyses, our unit of analysis was the health system year. In 
our initial analytic step, we used 1-way analysis of variance to make 
comparisons between health systems stratified by their physician 
teamwork level. For these comparisons, we broke our observations 
(health system×years) into 3 equal groups. The clustering coefficient 
values were (0, 0.200) for the low group (n=1514), (0.201, 0.273) for 
the moderate group (n=1513), and (0.274, 0.714) for the high group 
WHAT IS KNOWN
• Coronary artery bypass grafting is a team sport, 
involving multiple physicians who work together 
before, during, and after surgery.
• Frequent interactions between these physician team-
mates around shared patients may influence their 
collective performance.
WHAT THE STUDY ADDS
• In the Medicare population, substantial variability 
exists in the level of physician teamwork (as mea-
sured by the bipartite clustering coefficient) around 
coronary artery bypass grafting episodes across 
health systems.
• Health systems in which surgeons and nonsurgeons 
work together in tightly knit groups during coro-
nary artery bypass grafting episodes achieve lower 
emergency department visit, readmission, and mor-
tality rates after the index hospitalization, even after 
adjusting for a variety of regional- and hospital-level 
factors.

(n=1513). We compared the communities (defined using hospital ser-
vice area boundaries20) served by each health system over a range 
of sociocultural (total resident population, total black population, to-
tal Hispanic population, proportion of residents living below federal 
poverty line, proportion of residents with a bachelor’s degree, and 
proportion of residents living in a rural area) and healthcare capac-
ity factors (number of acute care hospital beds per 1000 residents, 
number of PCPs per 100 000 residents, number of medical specialists 
per 100 000 residents, and number of surgeons per 100 000 residents).
In addition, we evaluated the differences between anchor hospi-
tals, where CABG was performed in health systems with low versus 
high teamwork levels. Specific hospital factors examined included the 
number of CABG patients treated, the number of physicians provid-
ing care around the CABG episode, the proportion of CABG patients 
from outside the Core-Based Statistical Area in which the hospital 
was located, and the mean Charlson score for the hospital’s CABG 
patients.21 We also used data from the American Hospital Association 
Annual Survey to compare anchor hospitals with regards to their aca-
demic status.22
We then estimated a series of multivariable regression models to 
assess whether surgical outcomes (60-day ED visit, readmission, and 
mortality) varied significantly by a health system’s teamwork level. 
We used a random-effects negative binomial specification to model 
care teamwork, treating the health system’s bipartite clustering co-
efficient as a continuous predictor. In our random intercept models, 
we included random effects for health system. We adjusted our mod-
els for the hospital- and hospital service area–level factors described 
above, as well as for the number of physicians in the network. All 
models had year fixed effects (ie, a categorical variable for year was 
included in each model; the reference year was 2008).
Finally, we performed several sensitivity analyses to test the ro-
bustness of our findings. To determine whether our results were in-
fluenced by differences in case severity between health systems, we 
reran our models controlling for the proportion of a health system’s 
CABG procedures that were performed during an urgent or emergent 
admission. Given that early mortality after CABG may be a marker 
for more severe cardiac disease, we repeated our analyses control-
ling for the proportion of beneficiaries undergoing CABG in a health 
Figure 1. Measuring a physician referral network’s level of teamwork. We computed our measure of teamwork, the bipartite clustering 
coefficient, by counting, for each hospital network, the total number of pairs of physicians who share a single patient (or more) in 
common, denoted as S (see the left panel in the figure), and the total number of pairs of physicians who share multiple patients in 
common, denoted as M (see the middle panel in the figure). After obtaining these values, we calculated the measure as M/S. We multiply 
the final value by 4 because there are 4 S configurations for every M configuration.
Figure 2. Illustrative example of 2 health systems in Texas, where CABG procedures were performed, based on 2011 data. The network 
diagrams above demonstrate the wide variation in teamwork levels among sample hospitals. The left-hand side shows a hospital in Fort 
Worth, TX, where physicians rarely share >1 patient in common, as indicated by the low density of red ties (which correspond to the M 
component of our bipartite clustering coefficient) and the overall sparseness of the network. The right-hand side, by contrast, shows a 
hospital in Waco, Texas, where teamwork is much more common. The network diagram shows a high density of red ties, indicating many 
shared patients among physicians. These many overlapping ties have the effect of bringing members of the network close together, 
as seen in the center of the diagram. Notice that both hospitals have a similar number of patients and physicians, and differences in 
teamwork levels are not attributable to simple differences in network size.

system who survived >3 days post procedure. To examine the effects 
of shortening or lengthening the claims window used to measure our 
outcomes of interest, we also fit separate models based on 30- and 
90-day follow-up periods, respectively.
We performed all analyses using Stata SE Version 13.1. All tests 
were 2-tailed, and the probability of type 1 error was set at 0.05. 
The Health Sciences Institutional Review Board of the University of 
Michigan approved this study.
Results
In total, we examined 251 630 Medicare beneficiaries who 
underwent CABG during the study period. Over the course of 
their surgical episodes, these beneficiaries were cared for by 
466 243 physicians practicing in 1186 health systems. The level 
of teamwork for CABG varied substantially across these health 
systems. Specifically, the minimum observed value for a health 
system’s bipartite clustering coefficient was 0 (where no physi-
cians shared multiple patients), and the maximum observed value 
was 0.71 (where many physicians shared multiple patients).
As an example, Figure 2 shows 2 physician referral net-
works at health systems in Texas with higher and lower levels 
of teamwork for CABG based on 2011 data. Despite being 
only 90 miles apart and having similar patient and physician 
counts, there are visually striking differences between the 2 
with regards to their patterns of ties and, hence, clustering. 
For example, physicians in Fort Worth share relatively few 
patients with their colleagues, as indicated by the large num-
ber of gray-colored ties in the corresponding network diagram 
(Figure 2, left panel). With a bipartite clustering coefficient 
of 0.097, the Fort Worth health system has a relatively low 
level of teamwork for CABG and the network seems to be 
fragmented with a highly decentralized structure. By contrast, 
the network diagram for Waco (Figure 2, right panel) is highly 
interconnected around a dense core of physicians who share 
many patients (as indicated by the many red-colored ties). A 
bipartite clustering coefficient of 0.428 suggests a high level 
of teamwork through referral relationships around patients 
undergoing CABG in this health system.

for CABG, those with low levels served communities with

P<0.001 for each comparison). Their communities were, on 
average, less rural, and they had a higher proportion of col-
lege-educated residents (P<0.001 for each comparison). With 
regards to healthcare capacity, health systems with low team-
work levels for CABG tended to have more PCPs and medical 
specialists but fewer acute care beds and surgeons per capita 
(P<0.001 for each comparison).
Characteristics of the hospitals within these local health 
systems, where CABG procedures were performed, are dis-
played in Table 2. Generally speaking, the level of comor-
bid illness for patients undergoing CABG was comparable 
between hospitals. However, hospitals in health systems with 
low levels of teamwork for CABG were more likely to have 
an academic affiliation (P<0.001). In addition, they had larger 
physician staffs, treated more cardiac patients, and received 
more surgical referrals from outside their immediate geo-
graphic area (P<0.001 for each comparison) than those hospi-
tals in health systems with high teamwork levels for CABG.
Teamwork Level and CABG Outcomes
After accounting for the above differences between health 
systems, we found that higher levels of teamwork were

associated with significantly improved CABG outcomes (full 
model results are displayed in Table 3 and Table in the Data 
Supplement). Adjusted rates of ED visit, readmission, and 
mortality stratified by a health system’s teamwork level for 
CABG are displayed in Figure 3. Health systems with phy-
sician teams that worked together frequently around CABG 
episodes achieved ED visit, readmission, and mortality rates, 
which were 24.6%, 24.4%, and 28.4% lower, respectively, 
than those of health systems with low teamwork levels. Put 
differently, initiatives seeking to foster physician teamwork 
in health systems with low to moderate levels at baseline 
have the potential to reduce the number of ED visits, read-
missions, and deaths after CABG by 71.4, 53.7, and 16.8 per 
1000 discharges each year, respectively. These findings were 
robust across sensitivity analyses (Table 3; Table in the Data 
Supplement).
To understand the value of our teamwork measure on 
the model fit, we used a likelihood ratio test. The results 
from this test were significant for each outcome (readmis-
sions: χ2=74.24, P<0.001; ED visits: χ2=77.47, P<0.001;

were adjusted for potential hospital-level (the

outside the Core-Based Statistical Area, and

and mortality: χ2=53.05, P<0.001), suggesting that adding 
the bipartite clustering coefficient to the model improved its 
fit. We also examined the substantive importance of the mea-
sure by comparing it with other variables that should have an 
important influence on surgical outcomes. For example, we 
found that a 25% increase in the average Charlson score at a 
hospital was associated with an increase of ≈1 readmission per 
1000 CABG procedures. A similar 25% increase in the level 
of education in the community served by hospital (as indi-
cated by the proportion of residents with a bachelor’s degree) 
is associated with a decrease in readmissions of ≈21 per 1000 
CABG procedures. By comparison, a 25% increase in the 
bipartite clustering coefficient (our measure of teamwork) is 
associated with an approximate decrease in readmissions of 
17 per 1000 CABG procedures.
Discussion
In the Medicare population, we observed substantial variabil-
ity in the level of physician teamwork (as measured by the 
bipartite clustering coefficient) around CABG across health 
systems. Those health systems with lower teamwork levels 
tended to be larger academic medical centers that received a 
higher proportion of surgical referrals from outside their imme-
diate area. Health systems in which surgeons and nonsurgeons 
worked together in tightly-knit groups during CABG episodes 
achieved lower 60-day ED visit, readmission, and mortality 
rates after the index hospitalization, even after adjusting for a 
variety of regional- and hospital-level factors. Taken together, 
the benefits of planned delivery system reforms focused on 
team building are likely to extend to surgical care.
To date, most studies examining the relationship between 
physician teamwork and clinical health outcomes have looked 
at the care of patients with chronic medical conditions.23,24 
Although findings from these studies are, no doubt, impor-
tant, their relevance to surgical patients, like those undergoing 
CABG, is unclear. Few would expect teamwork among phy-
sicians to have a measurable impact on operative complica-
tions, which are major drivers of health services utilization in 
the postdischarge period.25 However, major surgery such as 
CABG can also exacerbate existing comorbidities and even 
cause new organ system complications, for which timely 
recognition and information exchange between the surgeon, 
medical consultants, and PCP may play an important role in 
reducing subsequent ED visits, readmissions, and even death. 
Our study lends support to this possibility.
Our study must be considered in the context of several 
limitations. First and foremost, the interactions between physi-
cians that we identified were not directly observed but rather 
inferred through shared patients based on medical claims. As 
such, informal consultation without billing (ie, curbsiding), 
which is common in academic centers, where specialty fellows 
often provide after-hours care without in-person staffing, is not 
captured with our analysis. However, health services research-
ers are increasingly using sources of administrative data to 
construct physician social networks like the ones that we 
describe,26–28 and our approach has been validated in previous 
work. For example, to determine whether relationships ascer-
tained from medical claims correspond with actual professional 
relationships, physicians affiliated with a large academic and 
community physicians’ organization were recently surveyed 
about their referral and advice relationships with physician col-
leagues.29 Relationships assessed by this survey were then com-
pared with those identified by Medicare claims. Up to 82% of 
claims-based relationships were recognized by survey respon-
dents, suggesting that administrative data can be used to predict 
the existence of meaningful relationships between physicians.
Second, although we adjusted for differences between 
hospitals and the healthcare markets that they served in our 
modeling approach, we must acknowledge the possibility 
of residual confounding. For instance, there are important 
technical issues around CABG procedures (eg, small vessel 
caliber, the presence of aortic calcification, and the degree of 
left ventricular dysfunction), which can affect postsurgical 
outcomes, but are not captured in medical claims. Insofar as 
omitted variables exist, our estimates on the effects of physi-
cian teamwork could be biased. However, given the observed 
effect size, any omitted variable would have to be highly cor-
related with both our exposure and outcomes to negate our 
findings, which is less likely.
We also acknowledge that some tightly-knit groups of 
physicians may care for a disproportionate share of remote 
referrals. Because of their willingness to support providers 
who are external to their natural networks, these groups could 
seem to have lower teamwork levels than they would other-
wise. To account for this possibility, we controlled for the pro-
portion of patient undergoing CABG in a health system from 
outside its Core-Based Statistical Area. Although anesthesi-
ologists who work in the intensive care setting can influence 
perioperative outcomes, we excluded them from our physician 
social networks because we cannot cleanly distinguish their 
care from that of those who deliver anesthesia services in the 
operating room. In addition, our analysis was based entirely on 
older Medicare beneficiaries undergoing CABG, and it is pos-
sible that a health system’s teamwork level differs for younger 
patients and those subjected to other cardiac procedures. That 
being said, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services 
are spearheading many of the planned reforms to bolster 
teamwork. Thus, our findings will be of interest to clinicians, 
hospital leaders, and policymakers regardless of their general-
izability. Finally, as it is true with all observational studies, we 
cannot determine causality with these data, only association.
Limitations notwithstanding, our work has important 
policy implications. Under the current delivery system, phy-
sicians are responsible for only 1 aspect of a relevant set of 
medical decisions. Consequently, they may fail to see the full 
clinical picture for a given patient, lack the power to take all 
the appropriate actions given what they know, or even have 
affirmative incentives to shift costs onto others. To address 
this care fragmentation, policymakers have launched a variety 
of reforms that emphasize care coordination—most notably 
the patient-centered medical home, bundled payments, and 
accountable care organizations.
At the core of these reforms are the social levers such as 
shared accountability and collective incentives, the explicit 
intent of which is to encourage physicians to have stronger 
relationships with each other and build better social net-
works. The only way to understand the potential value of this 
approach is through network analysis. Along these lines, our

study is one of the first to explore whether modifiable attri-
butes of physician social networks that operate within health 
systems are associated with performance—and we are aware 
of only 1 other analysis in the specific setting of operative 
procedures.30 The implications of this are potentially power-
ful for cardiac surgery, where the development of heart teams 
has helped in perioperative decision-making but may also be 
extended to the postoperative period.31
In summary, we observed that Medicare beneficiaries who 
underwent CABG in health systems where physicians worked 
together frequently had fewer postoperative ED visits, read-
missions, and deaths. Our findings suggest that the way in 
which surgeons and nonsurgeons collaborate in their patients’ 
care could be manipulated in an effort to improve surgical 
outcomes. Indeed, programs being rolled out by Centers for 
Medicare and Medicaid Services and other payers are already 
incorporating such social innovations.32 Thus, further research 
is needed synthesizing both quantitative analyses (such as our 
own) of referral patterns and qualitative analyses of physi-
cian information sharing to better understand the contexts that 
shape physician teams.
