ABSTRACT
Background: Zinc is essential for the regulation of immune re-
sponse. T cell function declines with age. Zinc supplementation
has the potential to improve the serum zinc concentrations and
immunity of nursing home elderly with a low serum zinc con-
centration.
Objective: We aimed to determine the effect of supplementation
with 30 mg Zn/d for 3 mo on serum zinc concentrations of zinc-
deficient nursing home elderly.
Design: This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
study. Of 53 nursing home elderly (aged $65 y) who met eligibility
criteria, 58% had a low serum zinc concentration (serum zinc
,70 mg/dL); these 31 were randomly assigned to zinc (30 mg Zn/d)
(n = 16) or placebo (5 mg Zn/d) (n = 15) groups. The primary
outcome measure was change in serum zinc concentrations between
baseline and month 3. We also explored the effects of supplemen-
tation on immune response.
Results: Baseline characteristics were similar in the 2 groups. The
difference in the mean change in serum zinc was significantly higher,
by 16%, in the zinc group than in the placebo group (P = 0.007)
when baseline zinc concentrations were controlled for. In addition,
controlling for baseline C-reactive protein, copper, or albumin did
not change the results. However, supplementation of participants with
#60 mg serum Zn/dL failed to increase their serum zinc to $70 mg/dL.
Zinc supplementation also significantly increased anti-CD3/CD28 and
phytohemagglutinin-stimulated T cell proliferation, and the number
of peripheral T cells (P , 0.05). When proliferation was expressed
per number of T cells, the significant differences between groups
were lost, suggesting that the zinc-induced enhancement of T cell
proliferation was mainly due to an increase in the number of T cells.
Conclusions: Zinc supplementation at 30 mg/d for 3 mo is effective in
increasing serum zinc concentrations in nursing home elderly; however,
not all zinc-deficient elderly reached adequate concentrations. The in-
crease in serum zinc concentration was associated with the enhance-
ment of T cell function mainly because of an increase in the number of
T cells.

INTRODUCTION
The elderly have been described as having low zinc status or
decreased zinc intake (1–3). Previously, we showed that a high
proportion of nursing home elderly (w30%) had low serum zinc
concentrations at baseline and after 1 y of follow-up (4). In that
study, we observed that elderly patients with low serum zinc
concentrations (,70 mg/dL) had a significantly higher incidence
and longer duration of pneumonia, as well as all-cause mortal-
ity, than did those with adequate serum zinc concentrations
($70 mg/dL) (4). Zinc deficiency has been reported to impair
immunity (5, 6) and increase susceptibility to infectious dis-
eases, a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the elderly (5,
7–9). Zinc has also been shown to play an important role in the
regulation of the immune response, particularly that of T cell–
mediated function (10, 11). Zinc deficiency is associated with
changes in T cell–mediated function similar to those observed
with aging (10, 12, 13). The burden of both aging and zinc
deficiency on the immune system may further predispose frail
elderly populations to higher infectious disease risk. Zinc sup-
plementation has been shown to improve T cell–mediated
function (1, 6, 14–18) and to reduce infections in the elderly
(19). Zinc supplementation may therefore play an important role
in increasing serum zinc concentrations, improving immunity,
and preventing infectious diseases such as pneumonia in the
elderly (1, 5, 7).
To our knowledge, studies on zinc supplementation in elderly
nursing home adults with zinc deficiency, and thus the population
that is most in need of supplementation, are scarce. The potential
for reduction in infections and other chronic diseases is high if
zinc supplementation is found to be effective in increasing serum

 zinc concentrations in this easily targeted population. In this
study we aimed to show that it is feasible to identify and sup-
plement zinc-deficient elderly patients in nursing homes in the
United States with zinc. In addition, we hypothesized that zinc
supplementation of 30 mg/d over a period of 3 mo would sig-
nificantly increase serum zinc concentrations in this population.
Exploratory analyses were also conducted to determine the
impact of zinc supplementation on T cell function, specifically
lymphocyte proliferation, in this population. These findings may
pave the way for future longer-term research on simple low-cost
zinc supplementation interventions to prevent infections such as
pneumonia in the high-risk population of nursing home elderly
(20–22).
METHODS
Study design and intervention
A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled zinc sup-
plementation trial in nursing home elderly with a low serum zinc
concentration was conducted between July 2009 and January
2011. For 3 mo, those in the placebo group received daily
a capsule containing w50% Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs)8
of most essential vitamins (e.g., vitamins A, C, D, E, and B
complex) and minerals (copper, iron, and selenium), including
zinc (5 mg/d) in the form of zinc gluconate, whereas those in the
zinc group received daily a similar capsule, but with 30 mg Zn
also in the form of zinc gluconate. The mixture of micronutrients
was provided to all subjects to ensure Adequate Intake of
micronutrients, given that they were asked to stop their multi-
vitamin supplement. Fifty percent DRIs were selected because
few subjects meeting our eligibility criteria would have a dietary
intake of ,50% of the DRIs for micronutrients (23). The source
of the capsules was Tishcon Corporation (Westbury, NY). Before
study initiation, the zinc and placebo multimicronutrient sup-
plements were assayed in triplicate to confirm the zinc con-
centration in the study capsules. The mean 6 SD (% CV) zinc
concentrations for the zinc and placebo capsules were 30.2 6
1.5 mg (5%) and 4.7 6 0.4 mg (7%), respectively. Personnel
from the Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging’s Nutri-
tional Evaluation Laboratory, blinded to the content of the
supplements, performed the quality control measurements. The
capsules were packaged by one of the participating nursing
homes in blister packs. The nursing home unit dose dispensing
system was used to deliver the capsules. The clinical nursing
home staff administered the capsules during routine medication
rounds in the mornings. Adherence to the study protocol was
verified by review of nursing home medication records.
Recruitment and enrollment
Participants were recruited from 3 nursing homes in Boston,
Massachusetts, i.e., the Hebrew Rehabilitation Center for the
Elderly, the Bostonian Nursing Home, and the Harborlights
Nursing Home. The Tufts University New England Medical
Center and the Hebrew Senior Life institutional review boards
approved the protocol. The administrator, director of nursing,
medical director, consulting pharmacist, and/or infection control
director of each institution approved and supported the study.
Staff at each nursing home initially identified potential candi-
dates. Residents were included based on the following criteria:
$65 y old; .6 mo life expectancy, in the judgment of their
physician; willingness to be randomly assigned to one of the
treatment groups; ability to swallow pills; not currently on an-
tibiotics; willingness to replace their nutrient supplement with
our study supplement. Those consuming supplements of cal-
cium, vitamin D, and iron were not excluded (and were allowed
to continue consuming these supplements throughout the study).
Residents were excluded based on the following criteria: an-
ticipated transfer or discharge within 3 mo of enrollment; bed-
or room-bound continuously for the previous 3 mo; presence of
lung neoplastic diseases or other active neoplastic diseases re-
quiring chemotherapy and/or use of immunosuppressive drugs
(including .10 mg prednisone/d); nasogastric or other tube
feeding; long-term intravenous or urethral catheters (30 d);
presence of tracheostomy or chronically ventilator-dependent;
consuming supplements containing more than the DRI concen-
tration of nutrients known to affect the immune response, i.e.,
vitamins E, C, or B-6; selenium; zinc; or b-carotene, and un-
willing to stop; chronic prophylactic antibiotic treatment; pro-
tein energy malnutrition defined as albumin ,3.0 g/dL; and
BMI (in kg/m2) ,18. Written, signed, informed institutional
review board approved consent was obtained from each eligible
participant or his or her proxy before enrollment in the study.
After informed consent, eligible participants were screened for
serum zinc concentrations. For this study, we used a serum zinc
concentration cutoff of ,70 mg/dL to indicate low serum zinc
concentrations (24).
Sample size calculation and randomization
Our previous study in nursing home elderly (25) suggested that
the treatment group would have a 29 mg/dL increase in mean
serum zinc over the placebo group, with a within-group SD of
18 mg/dL. A sample size of 15/group would give a 99% chance
of declaring the difference between the 2 groups in mean in-
crease of serum zinc concentrations to be statistically significant
at the 0.05 concentration of significance.
Eligible participants were randomly assigned to either the
placebo or the zinc group at a 1:1 ratio. Enrollment ended after
recruitment of 31 participants. A randomization scheme (a se-
quentially numbered list of 3 blocks of 12 subjects) known only to
the study statistician was created (26). Treatment was assigned by
the study statistician, who had no contact with subjects and had
no role in data collection. Placebo and zinc capsule packets were
labeled with the subjects’ names by the statistician who held the
randomization code (all other investigators and the study nurse
were blinded to this information).
Data collection
Information regarding subject characteristics, diseases, in-
fections, use of supplements and medications, and vaccination
history was obtained from medical records at baseline. Medical
records and use of supplements were also reviewed, and data

 were collected at months 1, 2, and 3. Fasting blood was collected
at baseline and at study completion.
Outcomes
The primary outcome of this intervention study was change in
serum zinc concentration between baseline and month 3. In
addition, the impact of zinc supplementation on ex vivo measures
of cell-mediated immunity, specifically, lymphocyte proliferation
with the use of anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies, and phytohemag-
glutinin, as well as other measures of interest, such as C-reactive
protein (CRP), metallothionein, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH),
copper, and albumin, were also explored between baseline and
month 3.
Laboratory assays
Serum samples were collected with the use of trace metal–free
tubes. Serum zinc and copper were measured by direct-current
plasma emission spectroscopy (Beckman SpectraSpan VI Direct
Current Plasma Emission Spectrophotometer; Beckman In-
struments) according to the technical and application manual,
and according to Smith (27) and Dawson (28) at the Nutrition
Evaluation Laboratory, Human Nutrition Research Center on
Aging, Tufts University. Measurement of serum zinc has been
recommended by the WHO, UNICEF, International Atomic
Energy Agency, and International Zinc Nutrition Consultative
Group as the best available population-concentration biomarker
of zinc deficiency (24, 29). Fasting blood measures included
clinical chemistries, complete blood count (CBC), and other
measures such as copper, globulin, and albumin as previously
described (25). CRP (30) and LDH (31) concentrations were
also measured. Serum metallothionein concentrations were
measured with the use of a sandwich enzyme immunoassay
procedure [Human Metallothionein (MT) ELISA kit, BlueGene
Biotech].
Lymphocyte subpopulations
Percentages of lymphocyte subpopulations were determined
from whole blood with flow cytometry. Both reagents and pro-
tocols from BD Biosciences were used. The following sub-
populations were assessed with the use of monoclonal antibodies:
T cells (CD3), helper T cells (CD4), cytotoxic T cells (CD8),
B cells (CD19), natural killer cells, and natural killer T cells
(natural killer cells and CD3). White blood cells were stained,
fixed, and analyzed on a FACS-Calibur flow cytometer (BD
Biosciences), and acquired data were analyzed with the use of
FlowJo software (version 10.0.6; Tree Star). Isotype controls for
each antibody class and fluorochrome were used as negative
controls.
Lymphocyte proliferation
To assess the impact of zinc on T cell–mediated function, the
ability of T cells to proliferate in response to anti–T cell receptor
or a mitogen was determined before and after zinc supplemen-
tation. This measure has been shown consistently to decline with
aging and be affected by zinc deficiency and supplementation
(10–13). Twenty percent fresh whole blood diluted in cell cul-
ture media was stimulated with anti-CD3/CD28 antibody or
phytohemagglutinin. The culture media was Roswell Park Me-
morial Institute 1640, supplemented with HEPES (25 mmol/L),
glutamine (2 mmol/L), and penicillin (100 kU/L)/streptomycin
(100 mg/L) (Gibco Invitrogen). Blood was cultured in 96-well
round-bottom cell culture plates (Nunc) with phytohemaggluti-
nin (Difco Laboratories) at 25 mg/mL. Phytohemagglutinin from
different sources and different batches have different stimulation
potencies; the concentration 25 mg/mL was determined to be
optimal after a broad range of concentrations was tested accord-
ing to standard procedure in our laboratory. For antigenic stim-
ulation, plates were precoated with 10 mg/mL anti-CD3 antibody
(BD Biosciences), incubated at 378C, 5% CO2 for 90 min, and
then washed twice with media. Blood was then added with anti-
CD28 antibody (BD Biosciences) at 2 mg/mL. We used whole-
blood culture to determine lymphocyte proliferation rather than
peripheral blood mononuclear cells, because it is a better repre-
sentative of in vivo conditions and the data produced by the 2
techniques have been shown to correlate strongly with each other
(32). All samples were cultured in triplicate and incubated at
378C, 5% CO2 for 68 h and then 0.5 mcurie [3H]-thymidine/well
was added for an additional 4 h as previously described (33).
Cells were harvested onto glass fiber mats with the use of
a Perkin Elmer cell harvester (model no. C961961), and cell
proliferation was quantified as the amount of [3H]-thymidine in-
corporation into DNA determined by liquid scintillation counting
in a Perkin Elmer counter (model no. 2450–0060). T cell pro-
liferation is expressed as corrected count per minute (ccpm), i.e.,
stimulated count per minute 2 unstimulated count per minute.
Because phytohemagglutinin and anti-CD3/CD28 only stimulate
T cell proliferation, we normalized the proliferation data with the
number of T cells per microliter whole blood and computed the
ccpm/T cells per microliter whole blood. All materials were acid-
washed with hydrochloride (5 mol/L) for trace metal removal.
Reagents were purchased from the same lot unless limited by
expiration dates. Mitogens were portioned into small concentrated
amounts and stored at 2708C.
Statistical analysis
The percentage distribution of demographic, clinical, and
medical characteristics of participants in the zinc group compared
with the placebo group at baseline was computed. Blood con-
centrations of zinc, copper, CRP, and metallothionein, as well as
other laboratory results, including a CBC with differential, blood
lymphocyte profile, and lymphocyte proliferation, were com-
pared between groups at baseline with the use of Student’s t test
for independent samples, and within groups between the 2 time
points with the use of Student’s t test for paired samples. Use of
supplements and medications known and/or suspected to in-
fluence serum zinc concentrations during the study was com-
pared between groups with the use of Fisher’s exact test. Serum
zinc concentrations at baseline and at month 3 were also com-
pared between those with and without various baseline medical
conditions with the use of Student’s t test for independent
samples. ANCOVA was performed to assess the change in serum
zinc concentration between baseline and month 3 as the out-
come measure, treatment (where zinc group = 1 and placebo
group = 0) as a study factor, and baseline serum zinc concen-
tration as a covariate. This model assumes that subjects with the
same baseline serum zinc concentration should experience the

 same expected change except for the effect of treatment. Further
analyses were done, additionally controlling for baseline albu-
min, copper, and CRP, each in a separate model because of our
small sample size. Analyses of impact of zinc supplementation
on measures of lymphocyte proliferation and other measures
were also conducted with the use of our main ANCOVA model,
i.e., controlling for baseline concentrations. Correlations be-
tween change in serum zinc concentration and change in lym-
phocyte proliferation were conducted with the use of a Pearson
correlation. The difference in percentage change in outcomes
measures between groups was computed as follows: [(outcome
measure for zinc group/baseline measure for zinc group) 3
100] 2 [(outcome measure for placebo group/baseline measure
for placebo group) 3 100]. Two-sided observed significance
concentrations (P values) , 0.05 were considered to be sta-
tistically significant. Analyses were performed with the use
of SAS for Windows, version 9.2 and IBM SPSS Statistics,
version 21.
RESULTS
Study population
A total of 442 medical charts were screened from the 3 par-
ticipating nursing homes; 53 nursing home elderly were eligible
and therefore were screened for low serum zinc concentrations
(,70 mg/dL) (Figure 1). Of these, 31 (58%) had low screening
serum zinc concentrations. Participants were randomly assigned
to either the placebo group (n = 16) or the zinc-supplemented
group (n = 15) and were scheduled to start the study as soon as
possible after the screening blood draw. However, because of
end-of-year public holidays and other factors such as the hesi-
tation of family members to have participants participate in the
study after determination of eligibility, a few participants did not
start the study until several weeks later. Baseline blood samples
were drawn immediately before the start of placebo or zinc
supplementation. Baseline and month 3 blood samples were
analyzed for serum zinc concentrations at the study end. We
found that, in some participants who completed the study,
baseline zinc concentrations fell below their screening levels,
whereas in others, concentrations were above their screening
levels. Consequently, few subjects in both groups had serum
zinc concentrations higher than 70 mg/dL at baseline. Six par-
ticipants did not complete the study for various reasons, in-
cluding refusal to take study capsules and advice from their
physicians; one participant in the zinc group experienced nausea
on 2 consecutive days after ingestion of the zinc capsule at the
beginning of the study. A total of 25 participants completed the
study, with 13 and 12 receiving the placebo and zinc capsules,
respectively, over a period of 3 mo (Figure 1).

 Characteristics of study participants
The baseline demographic characteristics of participants in
both the placebo and zinc groups were similar for all variables
(Table 1). The baseline distribution of participants who were
diagnosed with diseases such as congestive heart failure, hy-
pertension, diabetes, Alzheimer disease, dementia, asthma,
emphysema/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cancer
were not different between the 2 groups (data not shown).
However, significantly more participants in the placebo group
were diagnosed with depression (77% compared with 33%, re-
spectively) (P = 0.025). There were no significant differences
between the placebo and zinc groups in the use of allowed
supplements (calcium carbonate, vitamin D, and ferrous sulfate)
(62%, 46%, and 15% in the placebo group, and 58%, 58%, and
17% in the zinc group, respectively; the mean percentage use
of these supplements was thus 44% compared with 41%, re-
spectively). Use of medications (e.g., sodium polystyrene sul-
fonate and ciprofloxacin) in the placebo and zinc groups (75%
compared with 46%, respectively) known or suspected to in-
fluence serum zinc concentrations was also not different at any
time during the study. Furthermore, despite the numerical dif-
ference in percentage of participants who had used these med-
ications, because the use of the drugs did not change during the
study and because the baseline zinc concentrations were not
different between the 2 groups, they are unlikely to have had an
impact on serum zinc concentrations that would have resulted in
a significant between-group difference.
Serum zinc, lymphocyte proliferation, and other immune
and biochemical measures
Serum zinc, copper, metallothionein, CRP, lymphocyte profile
(percentage T cells, helper T cells, cytotoxic T cells, B cells,
natural killer cells, and natural killer T cells), lymphocyte pro-
liferation, CBC differentials, and other measures were not found
to be significantly different at baseline between those in the
placebo and zinc groups (Tables 2–4). Outcome measure results
other than serum zinc are secondary analyses.
With the use of ANCOVA and controlling for baseline serum
zinc concentrations, the difference in the mean change in serum
zinc was significantly higher by 16% in the zinc group than in the
placebo group (b 6 SE: 10.7 6 3.6 mg/dL, P = 0.007) (Table 2).
In addition, controlling for baseline CRP, copper, and albumin,
each in separate models because of the small sample size,
did not change this finding (P = 0.01, 0.004, and 0.01, re-
spectively). Despite the mean increase, 42% of those who
completed the study in the zinc group did not reach adequate
concentrations ($70 mg/dL) at month 3; these participants were
highly zinc deficient at baseline with serum zinc concentrations
#60 mg/dL (mean 6 SD baseline serum zinc: 53 6 6 mg/dL;
range: 44–60 mg/dL).
With the use of similar ANCOVA models, differences in the
mean changes in lymphocyte proliferation induced by anti-CD3
(10 mg/mL)/CD28 (2 mg/mL) [b 6 SE: 9.7 6 3.7 (3 1000 ccpm)]
and phytohemagglutinin (25 mg/mL) [b 6 SE: 12.4 6 5.8 (3
1000 ccpm)] were statistically significantly higher by 47% (P =
0.02) and 45% (P = 0.05) in the zinc group than in the placebo
group, respectively (Table 4). Furthermore, we observed a sig-
nificant increase in the number of T cells in the zinc group after
3 mo of supplementation. The increase in the T cell number was
significantly higher in the zinc group than in the control group
(P = 0.03). Thus, we normalized the whole-blood lymphocyte
proliferation results with the numbers of blood T cells for each
subject and found that the difference in lymphocyte proliferation
no longer existed (Table 4). These data suggest that the observed
enhancement in T cell proliferation is mainly due to a zinc
supplementation–induced increase in the number of blood T
cells, and not to the ability of each cell to proliferate. Accord-
ingly, changes in serum zinc concentration were found to be
correlated with changes in both lymphocyte proliferation in-
duced by anti-CD3 (10 mg/mL)/CD28 (2 mg/mL) (r = 0.52, P =
0.02) (Figure 2) and the number of blood T cells (r = 0.39, P =
0.06) (Figure 3).
Metallothionein concentrations did not differ at baseline be-
tween groups, and the difference in mean change in metal-
lothionein after supplementation also was not significant. Of note,
although serum LDH concentrations did not differ at baseline, the
difference in mean change in LDH was higher by 22% in the zinc
group than in the placebo group after supplementation (P = 0.03)
(Table 2). The results remained significant after controlling
further for baseline CRP, copper, and albumin, each in separate
models.
DISCUSSION
The key finding from this study is that it is feasible to increase
serum zinc concentrations in nursing home residents with a low
serum zinc concentration through supplementation with zinc.
Serum zinc has been cited as the best available biomarker of zinc
deficiency in a population (24, 29). The difference in the mean
change in serum zinc concentration was significantly higher in
zinc-deficient elderly supplemented with 30 mg Zn/d than in
those supplemented with 5 mg Zn/d over a 3-mo period. As
observed in this study, the plasma zinc concentration has been
shown by Feillet-Coudray et al. (34) to increase in healthy late-
middle-aged men with normal zinc concentrations given a similar
dose of 30 mg Zn/d and over a longer period (6 mo). The same
study reported a significant increase in plasma zinc concentra-
tions after supplementation with a lower dose of 15 mg/d over a
6-mo period (34). Although some studies of zinc supplementation

 in both independently living and institutionalized elderly patients
have reported increased circulating zinc concentrations (14, 18,
35–37), findings have not been consistent, however, because of
different study designs; the zinc status of study populations; and the
type, dose, and duration of zinc supplements used (reviewed in 36).
In the present study, supplementation of zinc-deficient elderly
patients with a small amount of zinc (5 mg/d) (as provided in our
placebo group) was not effective in maintaining or increasing
mean serum zinc concentrations. The latter is also supported by
findings from our previous study in 617 nursing home elderly in
which supplementation with 7 mg Zn/d over a period of 1 y failed
to increase serum zinc concentrations. In that study, w30% of
subjects were found to be deficient in zinc at baseline and at
follow-up (4). Thus, our data suggest that a higher dose of zinc per
day is needed to prevent a decrease in or maintain serum zinc
concentrations in the elderly, especially in zinc-deficient elderly.
In this study, participants with serum zinc #60 mg/dL failed to
attain adequate concentrations of serum zinc ($70 mg/dL), de-
spite supplementation with 30 mg Zn/d for 3 mo. Despite the
small sample size, the mean difference in serum zinc concen-
trations between those with baseline serum zinc #60 mg/dL (n =
5) was significantly lower by 8% than in those with baseline
serum zinc .60 mg/dL (n = 7) (with the use of our main
ANCOVA model; b 6 SE: 222.6 6 10.1 mg/dL, P = 0.05). No
differences were observed in the distribution of participants
diagnosed with congestive heart failure, hypertension, diabetes,
Alzheimer disease, dementia, asthma, emphysema/chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, cancer, depression (including

cations known or suspected to influence serum zinc concentra-
tions between these 2 groups at baseline and at month 3.
Failure to respond to zinc supplementation by participants with
baseline zinc #60 mg/dL or these highly zinc-deficient partici-
pants may be due to various factors. Adjustments to increased
zinc intake after habitually low intake in highly zinc-deficient
participants may take months (38, 39), possibly longer than the
duration of this study, to establish a new state of equilibrium.
Furthermore, participants who failed to reach adequate con-
centrations of serum zinc despite supplementation may have

 a poorer ability to synthesize metallothionein (40), a zinc-
binding protein shown to decline in the elderly (41, 42);
metallothionein helps maintain zinc homeostasis in the gut and
other tissues (43, 44). In the present study, however, we did not
find any difference in the baseline and month 3 serum metal-
lothionein concentrations between those with baseline serum
zinc concentrations #60 mg/dL and .60 mg/dL. Genetics may
also influence a participant’s response to zinc supplementation
(45, 46). The composition of elderly gut microbiota may also be
a contributing factor; zinc absorption competition within the gut
between the enterocytes and the gut microbiota has been shown
to exist, limiting available zinc (47).
Potential side effects of high-dose zinc supplementation in-
clude manifestations of overt toxicity symptoms, including
vomiting, epigastric pain, lethargy, and fatigue, as well as
induced copper deficiency, which is associated with anemia,
neutropenia, and impaired immune function (48–50). Our dose of
30 mg Zn/d was well-tolerated by all participants in the zinc
group, except for one who experienced the nausea mentioned
above. Given that low dietary intake is a major contributor to
low serum zinc concentrations (24), especially in the elderly (1,
34, 51, 52), the total zinc intake in this study from food and
supplement likely did not exceed the recommended upper limit
of zinc intake (40 mg/d). This is confirmed by the fact that we
did not observe any adverse effects from zinc toxicity in those
who completed the study. It is important to monitor closely an
individual’s reaction to the dose given, especially in the first few
days of administration, so appropriate measures can be taken, if
needed, should any adverse reaction be observed. In this study,
serum copper concentrations did not change after zinc supple-
mentation (Table 2). This may result be due to the tolerable
moderate zinc dose provided and/or the 0.8 mg Cu/d provided in
the capsules given to the participants.
Zinc deficiency, even a mild zinc deficiency, adversely affects
clinical, biochemical, and immunologic functions (12, 53, 54).
This is because zinc has diverse biological functions in enzymatic
catalysis, redox regulation, cellular signal transduction, neurons,
and the immune system; .300 catalytically active zinc metal-
lothioneins and .2000 zinc-dependent transcription factors
have been recognized thus far (55, 56). In this study, LDH,
a zinc-dependent enzyme (57), was observed to increase in the
zinc group compared with the placebo group (Table 2), but re-
mained within the normal range (58). The activity of LDH has
been shown by Yousef et al. (59) to decrease in serum in a dose-
dependent manner with zinc deficiency. The authors concluded
that dietary zinc deficiency exerts alterations in the serum en-
zymatic activity (59).
Adequate serum zinc concentration is essential for proper
function of the immune system, particularly T cell–mediated
function. Zinc deficiency has been shown to be associated with
impaired T cell–mediated function. Aging is also associated
with impaired T cell–mediated function; thus, improving serum
zinc concentrations through supplementation has the potential to
enhance T cell–mediated function and resistance to infection in
this at-risk population. In this study, we found that zinc sup-
plementation significantly increased T cell proliferation, as well
as the number of peripheral T cells. When T cell proliferation
was normalized for the number of blood T cells in each subject,
a statistically significant difference between the 2 groups was no
longer observed, suggesting that zinc-induced enhancement of T

 cell proliferation in this population mainly was due to an in-
crease in the number of T cells. Although the underlying
mechanism behind the zinc-induced increase in T cell num-
bers was not determined in this study, based on previous in-
vestigations reviewed by Fraker et al. (10), we speculate that this
effect of zinc might be due to an increase in the production of
T cells and/or a decrease in the loss of T cell precursors via
apoptosis. This is further supported by the observation that
changes in serum zinc concentration were positively correlated
with changes in both lymphocyte proliferation and the number
of T cells per microliter of blood (Figures 2 and 3). Furthermore,
given that our previous study showed a significant correlation
between serum zinc concentration and incidence of pneumonia
in nursing home elderly, and the importance of T cells in sus-
ceptibility to infection, our data suggest that improving serum
zinc concentrations in elderly patients who are zinc deficient
might be helpful in reducing their risk of pneumonia and other
infections. Others have reported an improvement in immune
response and a lower incidence of infection in the elderly (14,
15, 19). Zinc supplementation has also been shown to reduce
both the risk and duration of pneumonia in children (60, 61).
This study confirms the feasibility of identifying and sup-
plementing zinc-deficient elderly with a low-cost intervention of
30 mg Zn/d in nursing homes, and that this dose of zinc is safe in
zinc-deficient elderly, because no side effects were observed in
supplemented individuals who completed the 3-mo study. In
addition, it demonstrated that the supplementation of zinc-
deficient nursing home elderly with 30 mg Zn/d for 3 mo in the
form of gluconate successfully increased serum zinc concentrations
to adequate concentrations of .70 mg/dL in those with baseline
zinc concentrations .60 mg/dL, but it suggests that those with
zinc concentrations #60 mg/dL may need a larger dose or longer
duration of supplementation. Furthermore, exploratory analyses
suggest that zinc supplementation improves T cell–mediated
function by increasing the number of functional T cells in the
periphery. As mentioned in the results section above, we do not
expect potential biases from the use of supplements and medi-
cations in the placebo and the zinc groups. Also, we do not
expect potential biases from differences in the distribution of
participants who self-consented, given that the data presented
are not based on any recall information and we did not observe
a significant difference at baseline between the 2 groups in the
outcomes reported. However, there is a potential for bias in the
estimate of treatment effect because of the loss of 52–71% of
the 31 randomly assigned participants who were included in
these analyses, depending on outcome. Future more definitive
studies of a larger size and longer duration and with additional
doses of zinc are needed to determine the impact of baseline
serum zinc concentrations and genetic and gut microbiota on the
optimal dose of zinc needed to maintain adequate zinc con-
centrations, improve the immune response, and decrease the
incidence and duration of infectious diseases, such as pneu-
monia, in zinc-deficient nursing home elderly. Findings from
such studies may have a significant impact on improving health
span and quality of life in the elderly as well as reducing the
economic costs associated with their care.
