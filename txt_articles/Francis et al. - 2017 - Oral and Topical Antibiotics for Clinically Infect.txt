Oral and Topical Antibiotics for Clinically Infected 
Eczema in Children: A Pragmatic Randomized Con-
trolled Trial in Ambulatory Care
ABSTRACT
PURPOSE Eczema may flare because of bacterial infection, but evidence support-
ing antibiotic treatment is of low quality. We aimed to determine the effect of 
oral and topical antibiotics in addition to topical emollient and corticosteroids in 
children with clinically infected eczema.
METHODS We employed a 3-arm, blinded, randomized controlled trial in UK 
ambulatory care. Children with clinical, non-severely infected eczema were ran-
domized to receive oral and topical placebos (control), oral antibiotic (flucloxacil-
lin) and topical placebo, or topical antibiotic (fusidic acid) and oral placebo, for 
1 week. We compared Patient Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM) scores at 2 
weeks using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA).
RESULTS We randomized 113 children (40 to control, 36 to oral antibiotic, and 
37 to topical antibiotic). Mean (SD) baseline Patient Oriented Eczema Measure 
scores were 13.4 (5.1) for the control group, 14.6 (5.3) for the oral antibiotic 
group, and 16.9 (5.5) for the topical antibiotic group. At baseline, 104 children 
(93%) had 1 or more of the following findings: weeping, crusting, pustules, or 
painful skin. Mean (SD) POEM scores at 2 weeks were 6.2 (6.0) for control, 8.3 
(7.3) for the oral antibiotic group, and 9.3 (6.2) for the topical antibiotic group. 
Controlling for baseline POEM score, neither oral nor topical antibiotics produced 
a significant difference in mean (95% CI) POEM scores (1.5 [-1.4 to 4.4] and 1.5 
[-1.6 to 4.5] respectively). There were no significant differences in adverse effects 
and no serious adverse events.
CONCLUSIONS We found rapid resolution in response to topical steroid and 
emollient treatment and ruled out a clinically meaningful benefit from the addi-
tion of either oral or topical antibiotics. Children seen in ambulatory care with 
mild clinically infected eczema do not need treatment with antibiotics.

INTRODUCTION
E
czema affects nearly 1 in 5 people in the United States and the 
United Kingdom and can significantly impair quality of life.1-3 The 
condition is characterized by exacerbations and remissions, and 
in the United Kingdom it is estimated that children experience approxi-
mately 2.2 million eczema flares (worsening of their eczema) a year.4 The 
cause of flares, however, remains uncertain.5 There are no published data 
on how eczema flares are managed in primary care, but it has been esti-
mated that 40% are treated with topical antibiotics, and our unpublished 
pilot study suggests that 54% of children with eczema aged 5 years or 
younger are given antibiotics in the course of a year.4 Widespread use of 
antimicrobials is a key contributor to the development of antimicrobial 
resistance and exposes children to possible harms from adverse effects.6
Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) can be isolated from lesional skin in about 
70% of patients with eczema. The odds of colonization are nearly 20 times 
those in people without eczema,7 and more severe eczema is associated

with higher organism density.8 Despite the clear asso-
ciation between eczema and the presence of S. aureus, 
however, there is uncertainty about what constitutes 
infection and when antibiotic treatments are likely to 
confer benefit.9 A 2010 update of a Cochrane review of 
antimicrobial interventions for eczema found that most 
relevant studies were small and of poor quality. None 
found meaningful clinical benefit from antimicrobial 
intervention despite reduction in the presence of S. 
aureus, and the authors questioned the ongoing use of 
antibiotics for eczema flares.10
We set out to assess whether oral or topical anti-
biotics, in addition to standard treatment with topical 
corticosteroids, were more effective than placebo in 
reducing subjective eczema severity in children with 
clinically infected eczema.
METHODS
CREAM (Children with Eczema Antibiotic Manage-
ment study) was a 3-arm, double-dummy, blinded, 
individually randomized controlled trial in ambulatory 
care in the United Kingdom.
Participants
Children aged 3 months to 7 years were eligible if they 
were consulting in a participating National Health Ser-
vice (NHS) general practice or direct-access dermatol-
ogy clinic for clinically infected eczema.11 Treating 
clinicians were asked to include patients whom they 
believed to have infected eczema and were given guid-
ance that symptoms or signs suggestive of infection 
could include the following: 
•  
eczema that is failing to respond to standard treat-
ment with emollients and/or mild-to-moderate topi-
cal corticosteroids
• a flare in the severity or extent of the eczema
• weeping or crusting
Children were excluded if they had recently used 
potent or very potent topical corticosteroids or 
antibiotics or if they had features of severe infec-
tion or significant comorbid illness (Supplemental 
Appendix 1, available at http://www.AnnFamMed.org/
content/15/2/124/suppl/DC1/).
Interventions
Participants were randomized to 1 of 3 study arms: oral 
and topical placebos (the control group); oral antibi-
otic and topical placebo (the oral antibiotic group, or 
OA); or topical antibiotic and oral placebo (the topi-
cal antibiotic group, or TA). Random allocation was 
undertaken by site pharmacies using block randomiza-
tion with randomly chosen balanced block sizes of 6 or 
9. Participants, parents, and all other members of the 
study team were blinded to allocation. The oral anti-
biotics under evaluation were flucloxacillin (floxacillin) 
suspension (250mg/5mL) or erythromycin suspension 
(250mg/5mL) for those with penicillin allergy. Parents 
were instructed to administer 2.5mL (125mg) 4 times 
a day to participants aged 2 years or less and 5mL 
(250mg) 4 times a day to older participants for 7 days. 
The topical antibiotic under evaluation was 2% fusidic 
acid cream, applied 3 times a day for 7 days. All place-
bos were matched according to taste and appearance. 
All participants were also prescribed a topical cortico-
steroid: hydrocortisone 1% for the face and clobetasone 
butyrate 0.05% (or equivalent) for other parts of the 
body, and an emollient of their choice (excluding emol-
lients containing antimicrobials).
Data Collection
Research nurses conducted a baseline visit as soon as 
possible and no later than 72 hours after a patient was 
identified by a participating site. The baseline visit was 
used to obtain consent, collect baseline data, and sup-
ply study medication. Baseline data collected included 
demographics, duration of current flare, medication, 
symptoms, temperature, signs of infection, and the 
outcome measures detailed below. Parents were asked 
to complete a 4-week daily diary of symptom severity 
(skin redness, cracking, soreness, itch, sleep distur-
bance, oozing or weeping, bleeding, and fever), adverse 
effects (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, 
joint pains, and new rash), medication use, and consul-
tations. Research nurses visited participants again at 2 
and 4 weeks and reviewed their medical records at 3 
months. At that point, parents of participants were also 
asked to complete a postal questionnaire.
The primary outcome was the Patient Oriented 
Eczema Measure (POEM) score at 2 weeks. POEM 
measures subjective eczema severity over the previous 
week and results in a score from 0 to 72, with higher 
scores representing more severe eczema severity.12 The 
minimum clinically important difference for POEM is 
about 3.13,14 Secondary outcomes were the Eczema Area 
and Severity Index (EASI),15 Infants Dermatitis Qual-
ity of Life instrument (IDQoL)16 for participants aged 3 
months to 4 years, Children’s Dermatology Life Qual-
ity Index (CDLQI)17 for participants aged 4 years to 8 
years, Dermatitis Family Impact (DFI)18 instrument, and 
the Atopic Dermatitis Quality of Life (ADQoL) instru-
ment.19 The weight of unused study medication (includ-
ing steroids) was measured at 2 weeks. The research 
nurses collected swabs of the eczematous skin, throat 
and anterior nares at baseline and week 2, and the par-
ents were asked to do so again at 3 months. Baseline skin 
swabs were used to describe the prevalence of S. aureus 
found on participants’ eczematous skin, and baseline

and follow-up swabs were used to identify antimicrobial 
resistance in S. aureus and beta-hemolytic streptococci 
(Supplemental Appendix 2, available at http://www.
AnnFamMed.org/content/15/2/124/suppl/DC1/).
Analysis
Our initial sample size calculation was based on a clini-
cally important difference of 3 in POEM score and 
a common standard deviation of 7. Using α = 0.025 
and 90% power we determined that we required 137 
participants per treatment group, giving a total of 
411, or 517 when allowing 20% loss to follow-up. In 
April 2014, we used the data from the first 69 partici-
pants to revisit some of the parameters in the sample 
size calculation. Using the standard deviation from 
the baseline POEM scores (5.3) and the correlation 
between baseline and 2-week POEM scores (0.27) and 
the same clinically important difference for POEM, we 
found that 75 patients per group are required to reach 
90% power, giving a total of 225 required for analysis. 
Continuing to allow 20% loss to follow-up resulted in a 
revised recruitment target of 282 participants.
Our primary analyses were intention-to-treat 
comparisons of week 2 POEM scores in each of the 2 
intervention groups with control, adjusted for baseline 
POEM scores using ANCOVA. Secondary analyses 
were also carried out using ANCOVA. We used rules 
on missing data from the score questionnaire develop-
ers (Supplemental Appendix 3, available at http://www.
AnnFamMed.org/content/15/2/124/suppl/DC1/). Daily 
symptom scores were added to create a total daily 
symptom severity score. Mean daily symptom scores 
for each group were plotted and compared using area-
under-the-curve analyses. Medication use was calcu-
lated as the proportion between the number of doses/
applications recorded in the patient diary and the total 
number of prescribed doses for that medication. Topical 
corticosteroids were classified as mild, moderate, potent, 
or very potent using British National Formulary clas-
sification.20 Skin swab results were expressed as the pro-
portion of participants in whom S. aureus was isolated at 
each time point and the proportion of these swabs with 
resistance to medications under investigation.
We converted data on adverse effects to a binary 
variable using slight problem or worse as a cut-point, and 
we compared the odds of experiencing any adverse 
effect in each of the treatment groups with those in the 
control group.
We also conducted sensitivity analyses to assess 
for efficacy while controlling for adherence (Complier 
Average Casual Effect [CACE]) and to assess potential 
information bias from missing data (multiple imputa-
tion). A CACE analysis aims to estimate the causal 
effects of the intervention in those individuals who 
comply with (adhere to) treatment, and is recom-
mended over per-protocol analyses.21
Analyses were conducted using SPSS version 20 
(IBM Corp). The full trial protocol is available as a 
supplementary file (Supplemental Appendix 4, avail-
able at http://www.AnnFamMed.org/content/15/2/124/
suppl/DC1/). The study was approved by the National 
Research Ethics Service South Wales Ethics Commit-
tee (Reference: 12/WA/0180), and is registered with 
the ISRCTN registry: 96705420.
RESULTS
Ninety-four sites (90 general practices and 4 hospital 
dermatology clinics) were opened between July 2013 
and November 2014, and of these, 33 (32 general prac-
tices and 1 dermatology clinic) recruited 1 or more 
participants. Participating sites were slightly larger 
than non-participating practices (mean practice list size 
9,452 vs 6,451), but there were no significant differ-
ences in number of partners, proportion of list aged 8 
years or less, or proportion of children aged 8 years or 
less who have eczema.22
One hundred thirteen participants were randomized 
(Supplemental Appendix 5, available at http://www.
AnnFamMed.org/content/15/2/124/suppl/DC1/), which 
was less than the target sample size. Three participants 
had penicillin allergy, but none were randomized to the 
oral antibiotics group, so no participants received oral 
erythromycin. There were no significant differences in 
baseline characteristics among the 3 groups (Table 1). 
More than 90% of participants had 1 or more classic 
signs of infection recorded by the recruiting clinician, 
and 70% had S. aureus isolated from a skin swab. Nurse 
baseline assessments (n = 100) revealed that 30.0%, 
10.1%, 6.8%, and 53.0% had moderate or severe crust-
ing, weeping, pustules, and erythema respectively.
POEM scores were similar in the 3 groups at base-
line, and reduced (improved) in all 3 groups by 2 weeks 
(Table 2). At 2 weeks there were no significant dif-
ferences between POEM scores in the 2 intervention 
groups compared with control, controlling for baseline 
POEM score (Table 2).
POEM scores at 4 weeks and 3 months, and other 
secondary outcomes, all suggested no or minimal 
clinical benefit from oral or topical antibiotics (Table 
2 and Supplemental Appendix 6, available at http://
www.AnnFamMed.org/content/15/2/124/suppl/DC1/). 
Total daily symptom scores decreased over the first 
week and then stayed relatively stable (Supplemental 
Appendix 7, available at http://www.AnnFamMed.
org/content/15/2/124/suppl/DC1/), and there were no 
significant differences in symptom scores between 
the 3 groups. There were no significant differences

in reported use of topical corticosteroids (Table 3). 
Adjusting for medication use or missing data did not 
affect the results (Supplemental Appendix 8, avail-
able at http://www.AnnFamMed.org/content/15/2/124/
suppl/DC1/). 
Seventy percent of patients had S. aureus cultured 
from eczematous skin at baseline; the percentage 
decreased to 44% and 36% at 2 weeks and 3 months 
respectively, with no significant differences between 
groups. Twenty-seven percent of baseline isolates 
were resistant to fusidic acid, and at 2 weeks this 
increased to 31% overall and 73% in the topical anti-
biotic group. By 3 months, non-
susceptibility rates had reverted 
to 15% overall and 25% in the 
topical antibiotic group (Supple-
mental Appendix 9, available at 
http://www.AnnFamMed.org/
content/15/2/124/suppl/DC1/).
No serious adverse events 
were reported. New rash, diar-
rhea, and vomiting were the 
most common adverse events 
reported, experienced by 
17.5%, 15.5%, and 12.4% of 
participants respectively. There 
were no notable differences by 
treatment group (Supplemen-
tal Appendix 10, available at 
http://www.AnnFamMed.org/
content/15/2/124/suppl/DC1/).
DISCUSSION
In this study, children with clini-
cally infected eczema flares in 
primary care recovered quickly 
with use of mild-to-moderate–
strength topical corticosteroids 
and did not benefit from the 
addition of either oral or topi-
cal antibiotics. The study did 
not meet its recruitment target, 
but the lower bands of the con-
fidence intervals for treatment 
effects (–1.4 and –1.6) are less 
than the published minimal 
clinically important difference 
for POEM, suggesting that these 
results are not due to chance and 
that the conclusion that antibiot-
ics offered no meaningful benefit 
would have been unlikely to 
change even if the sample size 
had been achieved.13,14 Secondary analyses were all 
consistent and in the same direction, showing small 
effect sizes and confidence intervals that included zero.
Strengths and Limitations
We have conducted the largest trial to evaluate the 
effect of oral and topical antibiotic treatment for clini-
cally infected eczema in children and the only such 
trial to be conducted in ambulatory care, where most 
children with eczema flares are treated. Randomiza-
tion was conducted independently, we used matched 
placebos, and there were no breaches in allocation

concealment. We found no evidence of differential use 
of medications, including topical corticosteroids, and 
adjusting for compliance did not alter our findings. 
Blinded outcome assessors used well-validated instru-
ments to assess subjective and objective eczema sever-
ity at baseline and at follow-up. We achieved high rates 
of follow-up, and our primary analysis was by intention 
to treat. Analysis of longer-term follow-up and analyses 
controlling for missing data were all consistent with 
our main finding that neither topical nor oral antibiot-
ics offer any clinically important benefit.
There is no standard definition of infected eczema, 
so we used pragmatic inclusion criteria based on 
clinical suspicion of infection. Included children were 
clearly experiencing flares in their eczema, consider-
ing that their mean baseline POEM scores were higher 
than those found in other ambulatory care stud-
ies (8.9 and 9.8 in COMET23 and BATHE24 studies 
respectively; unpublished data), there was a significant 
improvement in severity scores during the follow-up 
period in all groups, more than 90% had 1 or more 
“classical” signs of infection, and 70% had S. aureus iso-
lated from baseline swabs. Fewer than one-third, how-
ever, had moderate to severe crusting, and only 1 in 10 
had moderate to severe weeping, so it is possible that 
not all participants had actual infection. Nevertheless, 
all patients had what clinicians believed to be infected 
eczema, so the evidence provided by this study is of 
direct relevance to current practice. The mean age of 
children in our study was less than 3 years, and only a 
small number of participants were from ethnic minori-
ties. Therefore, our results may not be generalizable to 
older children or those from ethnic minorities.
Comparison With Other Studies
The only previous study to assess the effect of an 
antibiotic in children with clinically infected eczema 
involved only 33 children and found no difference 
between those randomized to cefadroxil and those 
randomized to placebo.25 Two further studies have 
examined the effects of topical antibiotics in children 
and adults with clinically infected eczema. Both stud-
ies reported improvements in investigator-graded 
severity over time, and both reported significantly 
better follow-up scores in those treated with combined 
antibiotic/steroid compared with each component indi-
vidually or control.26,27 Neither study, however, used 
any patient-reported or validated outcome measures, 
and neither study analyzed children separately. Two 
small trials of oral antibiotics failed to demonstrate any 
beneficial effect in children and adults with clinically 
uninfected eczema,28,29 and a trial of topical mupirocin 
plus hydrocortisone in 83 infants found no benefit over 
steroid alone in terms of the primary outcome but did

Implications for Practice and Research
Our data provide strong evidence that not all children 
with clinically infected eczema need to be treated 
with antibiotics. We recruited only a small proportion 
of potentially eligible study subjects, however, and 
excluded patients with severe infection. The table of 
baseline characteristics suggests that our cohort tended 
to have relatively mild signs of infection, so our results 
may not be generalizable to all children with clinically 
infected eczema. A greater understanding of different 
eczema infective flare phenotypes would help better 
define the boundary between those who clearly do not 
benefit from antibiotics and those who might. Some 
patients in this study may not have had infection at all. 
Without greater clarity about what constitutes infection 
in this context, however, it is difficult for clinicians to 
define infection clearly. Further research to better define 
clinically infected eczema may be helpful, but it is clear 
that at least some patients currently defined as having 
infected eczema are not benefiting from antimicrobial 
therapy. Topical antibiotics are frequently used in ambu-
latory care, especially in combination products with top-
ical corticosteroids, and their use can promote resistance 
and allergy or skin sensitization.31-33 We found resistance 
to fusidic acid in more than a quarter of patients at 
baseline and nearly three-quarters of the group treated 
with fusidic acid at follow-up. Less than 1% of S. aureus 
from community samples is methicillin resistant, and the 
lack of benefit in the flucloxacillin group, despite low 
levels of resistance to flucloxacillin found in our baseline 
swabs, suggests that resistance is unlikely to account for 
the lack of effect observed in this study.34
Children in all 3 treatment groups experienced 
substantial improvement in eczema severity over the 
first week following randomization. Little has been 
published about the natural history of eczema flares, so 
our finding that symptomatic improvement occurs over 
the first week and then levels off provides what is prob-
ably the best available evidence about recovery from 
clinically infected eczema flares that are treated with 
topical corticosteroids and emollients. The use of topi-
cal corticosteroids for eczema flares has a substantial 
evidence base, and participants recovered well with use 
of topical corticosteroids and emollients, so providing 
(or stepping up the potency of) topical corticosteroids 
and emollients should be the main focus in the care of 
milder clinically infected eczema flares.35
