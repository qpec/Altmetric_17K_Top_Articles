Abstract
The majority of patients with colon cancer will develop
advanced disease, with the liver being the most common site
of metastatic disease. Patients with increased numbers of tumor-
infiltrating lymphocytes in primary colon tumors and liver
metastases have improved outcomes. However, the molecular
factors that could empower antitumor immune responses in this
setting remain to be elucidated. We reported that the immunos-
timulatory cytokine LIGHT (TNFSF14) in the microenvironment
of colon cancer metastases associates with improved patient
survival, and here we demonstrate in an immunocompetent
murine model that colon tumors expressing LIGHT stimulate
lymphocyte proliferation and tumor cell–specific antitumor
immune responses. In this model, increasing LIGHT expression
in the microenvironment of either primary tumors or liver
metastases triggered regression of established tumors and
slowed the growth of liver metastases, driven by cytotoxic
T-lymphocyte–mediated antitumor immunity. These responses
corresponded with significant increases in tumor-infiltrating
lymphocytes and increased expression of lymphocyte-homing
signals in the metastatic tumors. Furthermore, we demonstrated
evidence of durable tumor-specific antitumor immunity. In
conclusion, increasing LIGHT expression increased T-cell prolif-
eration, activation, and infiltration, resulting in enhanced tumor-
specific immune-mediated tumor regressions in primary tumors
and colorectal liver metastases. Mechanisms to increase LIGHT
in the colon cancer microenvironment warrant further investi-
gation and hold promise as an immunotherapeutic strategy.

Introduction
Gastrointestinal cancers account for the majority of malig-
nancies worldwide with the highest 5-year mortality. Most
patients with colon cancer, the most common gastrointestinal
tumor, present with advanced disease, resulting in it being the
second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United
States (1). The most common site of metastases in these
patients is to the liver, and a combination of advances have
increased the survival of patients with surgically resectable
colorectal liver metastases (CRLM); however, long-term surviv-
al is rare even in these highly selected patients (2–5). For the
vast majority of patients, palliative chemotherapy is the only
present option. Improved outcomes through new therapeutic
strategies are desperately needed.
It has been demonstrated that tumor biology is accurately
governed by the number and location of tumor-infiltrating
lymphocytes (TIL) invading a primary tumor. Specifically,
the presence of activated and proliferating T cells within
primary colon tumors is associated with improved survival
(6, 7). We have previously demonstrated an association
between increased T-cell infiltrates and improved outcomes
in patients with CRLM (8), and our recent study of resected
CRLM from 76 patients confirmed that the increased num-
bers of TILs were associated with improved overall (OS) and
recurrence-free survival (RFS) after surgical resection (9).
These observations validated the underlying concept that
immunotherapy may play a viable role in managing patients
with advanced gastrointestinal malignancies, including colon
cancer (10).
Through Gene Ontology analysis of resected CRLM, we
have shown that LIGHT expression in the tumor microenvi-
ronment is significantly associated with both OS and RFS (9).
LIGHT (an acronym for homologous to lymphotoxins, shows
inducible expression, and competes with herpes simplex
glycoprotein D for HVEM, a receptor expressed by T lym-
phocytes) is a member of the TNF superfamily (TNFSF14)
and is an immunostimulatory cytokine that may augment
the antitumor immune response (11). CRLMs at baseline
have low levels of TIL and LIGHT expression (12); therefore,
we hypothesized that T-cell infiltration of colorectal tumors
and liver metastases could be enhanced by increased LIGHT
expression in the tumor microenvironment and that this
strategy could result in tumor-specific immune-mediated
tumor regressions.

 Materials and Methods
Animals, diet, and cell lines
All experimental protocols followed NIH guidelines and were
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees
of University of Illinois at Chicago (Chicago, IL). Six- to 8-week-
old female BALB/c mice (Charles River Laboratory) were fed
normal or doxycycline diet (TD.08434, Envigo). 293T cells and
a wtCT26 murine colorectal carcinoma cell line were obtained
from ATCC and were grown in DMEM or RPMI ¼ 1640 culture
medium (Life Technology) supplemented with 10% FBS (Invi-
trogen), respectively. All cell lines were authenticated, either by
ATCC or IDEXX (4T1), tested for mycoplasma, and used at low
passage numbers within 6 months of thawing (2014–2016). To
establish a stable CT26LIGHT cell line, transfectants were selected
with puromycin or G418, and drug-resistant clones were further
selected for LIGHT expression by limited dilution cloning. For the
inducible-expressing LIGHT CT26 cell line (CT26LIGHTi), drug-
resistant clones were transfected with pLVX-LIGHT. LIGHT expres-
sion on the cell surface was confirmed using LTbR-Ig as the
primary antibody, confirming its functional ability to bind LTbR.
Mouse blood doxycycline concentration was measured at 3
and 22 days after initiating diet, confirming non-measurable
amounts in animals fed regular chow, and significantly
increased levels in doxycycline-fed animals as determined using
an ELISA kit per manufacturer's protocol. Serum levels 3 days
after returning to normal diet were non-measurable similar to
controls. Amount of chow ingested was calculated daily and
was not different between groups.

and DNase I (Sigma); and MluI, PstI, BamHI, EcoRI, T4 DNA ligase,
and DH5 alpha competent Escherichia coli cells (New England
Biolabs). For in vivo lymphocyte depletion experiments; anti-CD3
(145-2C11), anti-CD8 (YTS 169.4), and anti-CD4 (GK1.5) were
purchased from BioXCell and anti-asialo GM1 from Wako Che-
micals. Mice were injected intraperitoneally with 100 mg anti-CD3
mAb, 200 mg anti-CD8mAb, 200 mg anti-CD4 mAb, or 20 mL anti-
asialo GM1 antibody on days �3, 0, and 7 (day 0 is the day of
primary tumor injection). Depletion was confirmed by flow
cytometry of peripheral blood 4 days after the first injection.
Western blot
Protein concentrations in cell lysates were determined using a
Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Lysates containing 25 mg of
protein were resolved on SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyviny-
lidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Bio-Rad), which were
blocked for 1 hour at room temperature in PBS containing 5%
BSA and 0.1% Tween-20, and then incubated 2 hours with
primary antibodies, washed, and detected using HRP-conjugated
IgG revealed by an enhanced chemiluminescence detection sys-
tem (Amersham).
Cell staining and flow cytometric analysis
Cells were harvested and suspended in 100 mL PBS containing
0.5% FBS, incubated at 4�C for 30 minutes after adding fluoro-
chrome-conjugated antibodies, washed, and analyzed using a
cyan ADP analyzer (Beckman Coulter). Events were collected and
analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star Incorporated).
In vitro CT26 cell proliferation, apoptosis, and migration
analysis
Cell proliferation was measured using a colorimetric non-
radioactive cell proliferation assay kit (Promega) in triplicate.
Absorbance at 450 nm was determined using a Bio-Rad iMarker
microplate reader. For cell apoptosis studies, cells were seeded in
triplicate, harvested, and resuspended with fluorochrome-conju-
gated Annexin V. Propidium iodide staining solution was added,
and cells were analyzed using flow cytometry within 4 hours.
Three-dimensional (3D) cell migration assays were performed as
previously described (13). Briefly, 105 cells were embedded in 20
mL of type I collagen gel (2.0 mg/mL, BD Biosciences). After
gelling, the plug was embedded in cell-free collagen gel (2.0
mg/mL) in a 24-well plate. After culture for another 3 days,
invasion distance from the inner collagen plug to the outer
collagen gel was determined with a phase-contrast microscope
(Carl Zeiss) and quantified using Image-J software.
T-cell isolation, cytokines production, and proliferation assays
in vitro
Ninety-six–well round-bottom plates were coated with anti-
CD3 and stored at 4�C overnight. These were then were coated
with rLIGHT for 4 hours at 37�C. T cells from the spleen or
draining lymph nodes, as indicated, were enriched using the Pan
T-cell Isolation Kit II (Miltenyi Biotech), labeled with CFSE
(eBioscience), incubated at 37�C for 72 hours, and analyzed by
FACS.
For T-cell cocultures with CT26LIGHT, 2 � 105 purified pan T
and 2 � 104 15,000-rad irradiated CT26control or CT26LIGHT
cells were seeded into a round-bottom 96-well plate containing
anti-CD3 beads (2.0 mg/mL). The cells were cultured in the
presence or absence of low dose (5 mg/mL) LTbR-Ig or control Ig
for 3 days. 3H-TdR (1 mCi) was added for the last 12 hours of
culture, and incorporation was measured with a topcount micro-
plate scintillation counter. For cytokine production, cell culture
supernatants were collected after 48 hours, and IFNg was detected
by ELISA following themanufacturer's instructions(eBiosciences).
Bone marrow–derived dendritic cells differentiation assay and
activation in vitro
Bone marrow–derived dendritic cells (DC) were harvested
from 6- to 8-week-old BALB/c mice and cultured in complete
media with Flt3 ligand at 200 ng/mL (14). On day 6, DCs were
exposed to 100 to 1,000 ng/mL of soluble LIGHT or lipopoly-
saccharide (LPS). On day 8, cells were stained for FACS analysis
with conjugated monoclonal antibodies.

 Mouse models of colorectal cancer
For subcutaneous models, 1 � 106 tumor cells in 100 mL PBS
were inoculated subcutaneously in the mouse flank. In the induc-
ible models, doxycycline diet was initiated when the tumor size
reached about 200 mm3. Tumor growth was monitored and
volumes were calculated using the equation 1/2(long diameter
� short diameter2). Clinical responses were evaluated by WHO
(�50% decrease in the product of the greatest perpendicular
tumor diameters) and RECIST (�30% decrease in the maximum
tumor diameter) criteria. Models of CRLM were performed as we
have previously described (12). In brief, 1 � 106 cells in 50 mL of
PBS were injected into the spleen parenchyma followed by
splenectomy. Mouse MRI was performed as previously described
(15). Briefly, imaging was performed using a 9.4-T small-animal
magnetic resonance imager (Agilent Technologies), gradient
strength 1,000 mT/m, and 39 mm ID birdcage volume RF coil.
Mice were anesthetized, and vital signs were continuously mon-
itored. An MRI-compatible small-animal gating system (SA
Instruments Inc.) was used to permit free-breathing acquisition
during MRI scanning. Axial images were obtained using a T2-
weighted fast-spin echo sequence with external trigger.
Cytotoxic T lymphocyte assay
Splenocytes were cocultured with target cells irradiated at
15,000 rad in 6-well plates in the presence of 20 IU/mL mouse
IL2 for 5 days. WTCT26 cells or 4T1 cells were labeled with 300mCi
51Cr at 37�C for 1 hour and washed. Labeled target cells (1 � 104
cells/200 mL/well) and serial dilutions of effector cells were
incubated in RPMI-1640 containing 5% FBS in triplicates in U-
bottom 96-well plates at 37�C for 4 hours. Fifty microliters of cell
culture supernatants was transferred to a 96-well reading plate
after being centrifuged, and percentage of lysis was determined
[(experimental � target spontaneous)/(target maximum � target
spontaneous) � 100]. Results were expressed as the percentage of
specific or nonspecific lysis.
Isolation of tumor-infiltrating cells from liver metastases
Tumor-infiltrating cells were isolated as we have previously
described (12). In brief, mice were euthanized, livers were imme-
diately perfused via the portal vein with 5 mL of PBS, and
metastatic liver tumors were isolated and resected. Sections
(0.5 g) of each tumor were minced into small pieces and digested
in 10-mL RPMI containing 2.5% FBS, collagenase IV (1 mg/mL,
Sigma), and DNase I (200 mg/mL, Sigma). These were then
strained to obtain a single-cell suspension, and cell viability was
determined by trypan blue exclusion, which was more than 90%.
Peripheral blood mononuclear cell isolation
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated as previously
described (12). In brief, following euthanasia, mouse peripheral
blood was obtained via retro-orbital bleed. Specimens were
loaded to the top of a Ficoll-Hypaque centrifugation column,
and the lymphocyte-enriched layer was collected, and red blood
cells were lysed with ACK lysing buffer (Invitrogen).
RNA extraction from liver tumor metastases
Surgically dissected liver metastases (CRLM) were immediately
frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at �70�C. One milliliter of
TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) per 50 to 100 mg of tissue was added
to tumor tissue after frozen specimens were pulverized (Biopul-
verizer, BioSpec Products). Chloroform (0.2 mL) per 1 mL of
TRIzol reagent was added to the tissue–TRIzol mixture to disso-
ciate nucleoprotein complexes. The RNA pellet was washed and
dissolved in RNase-free water.
Real-time quantitative RT-PCR assay
Five micrograms of total RNA was reverse-transcribed into
cDNA by using the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription
Kit (AB Applied Biosystems), and real-time quantitative PCR
analysis was performed (Bio-Rad CFX connect real-time system).
Each cDNA sample was amplified in triplicate for CCL21, MAd-
CAM-1, and GAPDH using the Fast SYBR Green Master Mixture Lit
in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions (AB Applied
Biosystems). The primer sequence for CCL21 was 50-AGA CTC
AGG AGC CCA AAG CA-30 (forward primer) and 50-GTT GAA
GCA GGG CAA GGG T-30 (reverse primer). The primer for
MAdCAM-1 was 50-GAC ACC AGC TTG GGC AGT GT-30 (forward
primer) and 50-CAG CAT GCC CCG TAC AGA G -30 (reverse
primer). The primer for GAPDH was 50-AAC TTT GGC ATT GTG
GAA GG-30 (forward primer) and 50-CAC ATT GGG GGT AGG
AAC AC-30 (reverse primer). PCR conditions were 20 seconds at
95�C, 3 seconds at 95�C, and 30 seconds at 60�C for 40 cycles. The
concentration of the target gene was determined by the compar-
ative CT method and normalized to the internal GAPDH control.
Tumor tissue immunofluorescence
Tumors were fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin and
paraffin-embedded. Five-micrometer-thick tissue sections were
deparaffinized, microwaved while boiling for 15 minutes in ph
6 citrate antigen retrieval buffer, treated with blocking buffer, and
incubated with anti-CD3 optimized at a dilution of 1:750
(Abcam, clone SP7). Slides were then incubated with ImmPRESS
goat anti-rabbit peroxidase polymer (Vector Laboratories, MP-
7451). Signal amplification was performed using Opal 520 tyr-
amide signal amplification reagent (PerkinElmer). A second
microwave step was performed to remove labeled primary and
secondary antibodies, leaving fluorescent label directly bound to
the target site. Slides were counterstained with DAPI and cover-
slipped using Vectashield antifade mounting medium (Vector
Laboratories, H-1400). Slides were scanned at 20� on a Vectra
multispectral imaging system (PerkinElmer). Using inForm soft-
ware (PerkinElmer), CD3-positive cells and total CT26 cells were
quantified, and CD3 cells per 100 tumor cells were determined.
Individual 20� fields were stitched into whole-slide images using
a custom routine in MATLAB (MathWorks). All imaging analyses
were conducted by personnel who were blinded to the treatment
status of the samples.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed by the 2-tailed Student t test.
Error bars represent SEM. Statistical significance was considered
for �, P < 0.05 and ��, P < 0.01.

 analysis of whole-cell lysates confirmed constitutive and induc-
ible expression (Fig. 1B and C). To establish that transfected CT26
cells maintained similar characteristics to wtCT26 cells, prolifer-
ation, apoptosis, and migration assays were performed. Cell
morphology was assessed with bright-field microscopy and
revealed no observable differences between the cells. CT26LIGHT
cells demonstrated similar cell growth/proliferation and survival
to wtCT26 and CT26control (empty vector) cells. (Fig. 1D and
Supplementary Fig. S1a). 3D migration assays revealed no dif-
ference in the relative distance traveled for wtCT26, CT26control,
and CT26LIGHT cells (Supplementary Fig. S1b and S1c).
CT26LIGHTi cells also displayed similar cell growth and apopto-
sis to wild-type (wt) and control cells and did not migrate less than
wt or control cells. Thus, the expression of LIGHT on CT26 cells

CT26LIGHTi cells in the presence of doxycycline. The LIGHT-expressing murine fibrosarcoma cell line Ag104LIGHT served as a positive control. D, WTCT26,
CT26control (empty vector), CT26controli, CT26LIGHT, and CT26LIGHTi cells were evaluated for proliferation, apoptosis, and migration. Representative
experiments are shown of the constitutive expressing cell line (see also Supplementary Fig. S1). Cells were seeded in triplicate, and MTS/PMS solution was

LIGHT induces T-cell proliferation, activation, and DC
maturation in vitro
Purified T cells cultured with immobilized recombinant
LIGHT experienced increased CD4 and CD8 cell proliferation
with increasing doses of LIGHT (Fig. 2A and B). Thus, the
purified extracellular domain of LIGHT was sufficient to costi-
mulate purified T cells in vitro. As the adaptive immune
response appeared to be activated by LIGHT expression in the
tumor microenvironment, its effect on DCs was examined.
Bone marrow–derived DCs were treated in vitro with soluble
LIGHT for 2 days and analyzed for surface expression of the DC
cell maturation and activation marker CD86 (Fig. 2C). CD86
increased in a dose-dependent manner to levels comparable
with LPS control, indicating that LIGHT can stimulate DC
maturation and expression of signals necessary for T-cell acti-
vation and survival.
Similar to immobilized recombinant LIGHT, CT26LIGHT cells
cocultured with purified T cells resulted in significantly increased
T-cell proliferation. To determine that the proliferation was sec-
ondary to LIGHT binding to its receptor on T cells, cells were co-
incubated with LTbR-Ig, which substantially blocked cell proli-
feration compared with CT26LIGHT cells treated with control Ig
(Fig. 2D). In addition, T cells incubated with CT26LIGHT signif-
icantly increased IFNg secretion over control, and treatment with
LTbR-Ig significantly decreased IFNg production compared with
treatment with control Ig (Fig. 2E and F). Thus, CT26LIGHT cells
stimulated T-cell proliferation and activation, and tumor cell–
expressed LIGHT could act as a costimulatory signal with engage-
ment of the T-cell receptor.

Recombinant LIGHT and LIGHT-expressing colon cancer cells enhance T-cell and DC activation in vitro. A and B, CSFE-labeled T cells were added to round-bottom
96-well plates coated with anti-CD3 and rLIGHT. CD4 and CD8 T-cell proliferation increased with increasing doses of rLIGHT. Shown are representative
results of three independent experiments. C, Bone marrow–derived DCs were exposed to 100 to 1,000 ng/mL of soluble LIGHT or LPS as a positive control.
Significantly increased DC cell activation was observed with increasing doses of soluble LIGHT. D, Purified T cells were cocultured with CT26control or
CT26LIGHT cells, revealing increased cell proliferation in the presence of LIGHT that was inhibited by the addition of LTbR-Ig mediated blockade of LIGHT's
cognate receptor. E and F, Cell culture supernatants were collected after 48 hours, and IFNg was detected by ELISA. Increased T-cell IFNg production was

 we wished to determine whether LIGHT in the in vivo tumor
microenvironment could stimulate a similar systemic adaptive
immune response. CT26LIGHTi or CT26controli tumors were
established in BALB/c mice. Once palpable and measurable
tumors were established, half the CT26LIGHTi mice and all
CT26controli mice were fed doxycycline diet to stimulate
LIGHT expression. Splenocytes were analyzed after 4 weeks for
T-cell populations. The percentage of CD3-, CD4-, and CD8-
positive T cells significantly increased only in animals with

Given that LIGHT expression on CT26 colon cancer tumor cells
induced systemic lymphocyte proliferation, we wished to deter-
mine whether these lymphocytes were tumor-specific and cyto-
toxic. The lymphocytes were used as effector cells, and their
cytolytic potential was assessed against 51Cr-labeled target tumor
cells in a standard 51Cr release assay (Fig. 3B). Splenocytes from

LIGHT-expressing tumors generated increased T-cell proliferation, a tumor-specific antitumor immune response, and significant T-cell–mediated tumor regressions.
A, Primary flank colorectal cancer cell tumors were established in BALB/c mice. Three weeks after tumor inoculation, splenocytes were harvested (n ¼ 15).
Mice with induced LIGHT expression (þdoxycycline diet) demonstrated increased numbers of CD3, CD4, CD8, and CD11cþ cells compared to CT26LIGHTi tumors fed
normal diet and CT26controli tumors fed doxycycline diet. B, Splenocytes from animals with established colon cancer flank tumors were then used as effector
cells, and their cytolytic capacities were assessed against 51Cr-labeled 4T1 cancer cells or wtCT26 tumor cells. Only lymphocytes from animals with LIGHT-expressing
CT26 tumors demonstrated tumor-specific cytotoxicity against wtCT26 and not 4T1 cells. C, CT26LIGHTi colon cell tumors were established in animals fed
normal diet (n ¼ 18) and once palpable and measurable were randomized on day 6 (arrow) to doxycycline diet (LIGHT induction) or normal diet. Significant tumor
regression began only in animals with LIGHT induction and continued with partial and complete tumor responses as measured by total tumor volume, WHO
criteria, and RECIST clinical tumor response criteria (pictured). D, Lymphocyte depletion was performed on specific immunocyte subsets. CT26LIGHTi colon cell
tumors were established in animals and on day 6 (arrow) received doxycycline diet (LIGHT induction) as before, confirming significant tumor regressions in
animals with LIGHT induction. The antitumor immune response was abrogated in the absence of CD3 and CD8 T lymphocytes.

 splenocytes from either CT26control mice fed doxycycline or
CT26LIGHTi mice fed regular diet, where no cytolytic activity
was demonstrated. These same lymphocytes from all 3 groups
had no cytotoxic activity against syngeneic breast cancer
4T1 cells, suggesting an antitumor immune-specific response
(Fig. 3B).
LIGHT expression in the tumor microenvironment induces
significant T-cell infiltration and tumor regression of
established tumors
Because LIGHT-expressing tumors appeared to stimulate T-cell
proliferation and tumor cell–specific cytotoxicity in vivo, we
wished to evaluate a clinically relevant effect of LIGHT expression
in the tumor microenvironment by using established colon cancer
cell tumors. CT26LIGHTi palpable and measurable tumors were
established. Animals were then randomized and half received
doxycycline diet to stimulate LIGHT expression. Mice with
induced LIGHT expression experienced rapid and significant
antitumor responses that were durable and persisted, ascompared
with control animals thatapproached humane endpoints and had
to be sacrificed (Fig. 3C). Tumors experienced both partial and
complete responses and met clinical WHO and RECIST tumor
response criteria for significant tumor regressions. Responders
experienced durable tumor regressions that persisted for more
than 5 weeks. When LIGHT induction (doxycycline diet) was
discontinued, responders continued to experience durable tumor
regression for weeks until sacrifice and many had complete tumor
regression.
T-cell depletion experiments were performed to further confirm
the induction of antitumor immunity in the model. The antitu-
mor immune response induced by LIGHT was significantly abro-
gated when animals were depleted of CD3 T cells and, more
specifically, depleted of CD8 T cells (Fig. 3D).
In additional experiments, tumors were harvested prior to
complete pathologic response to evaluate and quantify TILs (Fig.
4A and B). LIGHT-expressing tumors contained greater than 7
times the percentage of CD3þ cells in the lesions compared with
non–LIGHT-expressing tumors (Fig. 4C). The amount of TILs was
similarly significantly increased compared with CT26controli cells
that were also fed doxycycline diet.
LIGHT-induced tumor regression instills tumor-specific
antitumor immunity
To determine whether the antitumor immunostimulatory
effect of LIGHT expression in the tumor microenvironment could
induce long-term immune responses to distal tumors, mice (n ¼
16) were inoculated with CT26LIGHTi cells in the right flank. After
establishment of palpable tumors, half the mice were fed with
doxycycline diet to stimulate LIGHT expression. Fourteen days
later,the 8 mice fed doxycycline dietwere switched back to normal
diet. Three days later, after all doxycycline was confirmed to have
left the system, mice were injected subcutaneously with 4T1
syngeneic breast cancer cells in the contralateral superior flank
and with CT26LIGHTi in the contralateral inferior flank. 4T1
tumors grew rapidly and to a similar size in mice from both
groups after the tumor challenge. On the other hand, CT26LIGHTi
challenge tumors from mice previously exposed to LIGHT-expres-
sing tumors grew minimally and then disappeared, whereas the
challenge tumors in mice fed regular diet grew significantly larger
(Fig. 4D). The same antitumor immune response and inability for
tumors to grow occurred whether wtCT26 or CT26LIGHTi was
utilized as challenge tumors in this experiment. Mice were sacri-
ficed when humane endpoints were reached with 4T1 tumors and
CT26 tumors in the control animals.
Enhanced LIGHT expression increased TILs and lymphocyte-
homing signals in metastatic liver tumors with associated
inhibited growth of CRLM
CRLM were established in animals (Fig. 5A), and half of the
animals were randomized to express LIGHT. On day 25, livers
were harvested for tumor assays. Significantly increased LIGHT
expression was confirmed in the induced tumors as compared
with control tumors (Fig. 5B). The experiment was also repeat-
ed with constitutively expressing CT26LIGHT tumors. In both
models, tumor burden was significantly decreased in the
LIGHT-expressing tumors. Quantitative measurements of met-
astatic burden were determined by liver tumor area and total
liver weights. In both measurements, LIGHT expression was
associated with significant decreases in metastatic liver tumor
burden (Fig. 5C and D).
Peripheral blood from these animals revealed significantly
increased percentages of CD3þ, CD4þ, CD8þ, CD49bþ, and
CD11cþ cells from LIGHT-expressing animals compared with
controls (Fig. 5E). Evaluation of liver tumor single-cell suspen-
sions revealed significantly increased CD45þ tumor-infiltrating
leucocytes in LIGHT-expressing compared with non–LIGHT-
expressing metastatic liver tumors. Specifically, CD3þ lympho-
cytes, CD3�CD49bþ natural killer (NK) cells, and CD11cþ DCs
were found in significantly increased percentages in LIGHT-
expressing metastases compared with controls (Fig. 4F). Interest-
ingly, CD86 was significantly increased in CD11c DC cell popula-
tions only in LIGHT-expressing metastases, similar to results
observed in the in vitro experiments (Supplementary Fig. S2a).
In addition, transcript expression of the lymphocyte-homing
signals CCL21 and MadCAM-1 was found to be increased 3- and
2-fold, respectively, in LIGHT-expressing metastases (Supplemen-
tary Fig. S2b).
Discussion
For patients with CRLM, the best current chemotherapy regi-
mens are not curative and provide a median overall survival of
approximately 20 months (16–18). To improve outcomes for
these patients, new strategies are needed. Our previous studies,
along with those from other groups, have demonstrated an
association between increased T-cell infiltration in resected
tumors and long-term survival (6, 19–26). From gene analysis
data and immunohistochemistry of resected CRLM, it was
inferred that overall survival may be a function of multiple host
and tumor variables, including T-cell infiltration, but that tumor
recurrence is predominantly determined by the ability of the host
to mount and the tumor to support, lymphocyte proliferation,
activation, and cytotoxicity (9). Thus, it follows that immuno-
therapy may be a promising approach for advanced colon cancer.
The use of immunotherapy for gastrointestinal cancers, how-
ever, has met significant challenges. Vaccines may increase circu-
lating tumor-specific lymphocytes but appear to lack the ability to
impart significant tumor regressions even when cancer-associated
antigens are utilized (27, 28). Checkpoint blockade with anti-
bodies including ipilimumab, which have demonstrated antitu-
mor activity in other malignancies, (29, 30) has not been suc-
cessful in microsatellite-stable advanced colon cancer (31), and

LIGHT-expressing tumors induced increased TIL infiltration and generated persistent antitumor immunity. A, Tumors were harvested 21 days after tumor inoculation
(n ¼ 15). B, Individual 20� fields on Vectra multispectral imaging system were stitched into whole-tumor images. C, Total number of CD3-positive cells
and colon cancer cells in the tumor was quantified, and CD3 cells per 100 tumor cells was determined to be significantly increased in LIGHT-expressing tumors.
D, Mice with established CT26LIGHTi tumors (n ¼ 8 per group) were injected subcutaneously with 4T1 syngeneic breast cancer cells in the contralateral superior flank
and with CT26LIGHTi in the contralateral inferior flank. 4T1 tumors grew rapidly and to similar size in mice from both groups after the tumor challenge. On
the other hand, CT26LIGHTi challenge tumors from mice previously exposed to LIGHT-expressing tumors grew minimally and then disappeared, whereas the
challenge tumors in mice fed regular diet grew significantly larger. Tumor volumes of 4T1 are on the left y-axis, and volumes of CT26 are on the right y-axis.

LIGHT inhibits CRLM growth and increases metastatic TILs. A, CRLMs were established with CT26LIGHT and CT26LIGHTi colon cancer cells, and tumor burden was
followed with MRI imaging. B, CT26LIGHTi CRLM (n ¼ 7 per group) were resected on day 25. Increased LIGHT expression was confirmed in CRLM tumors
from animals fed doxycycline. C, Percentage of affected liver was quantified with imaging software and was significantly decreased in tumors expressing LIGHT.
D, Total tumor burden as measured with liver weight was similarly significantly decreased. E, Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from animals harboring
LIGHT-expressing CRLM demonstrated increased populations of CD3, CD4, and CD8 T cells, NK cells, and DC cells. F, LIGHT-expressing CRLM similarly recruited
increased numbers of total lymphocytes, CD3 cells, NK cells, and DCs into the tumor.

 furthermore, function via imprecise immunoactivation that
imparts significant autoimmunity in a proportion of patients.
Adoptive cell transfer, a strategy that has been used successfully in
a subset of patients with melanoma, renal cell cancer, and synovial
cell sarcoma, is challenging to utilize in patients with colon cancer
due to self-antigens, and a recent trial using T cells engineered
against the carcinoembryonic antigen demonstrated dose-limit-
ing toxicity (32). The main limitation to this approach has been
the lack of known colon cancer–specific tumor antigens and in
identifying a treatment strategy that can be utilized across a
spectrum of patients. Thus, there is a gap in our knowledge of
how to enhance TIL activation and proliferation in the tumor
microenvironment of CRLM, and we propose a strategy that
focuses on immunostimulation of naturally occurring TILs at the
level of the tumor.
LIGHT plays a key role in T-cell homeostasis and proliferation,
is produced by activated T cells, and mediates T-cell activation,
survival, and death (33–35). Our current research supports the
ability of LIGHT to stimulate effector T-cell proliferation and
differentiation both in vitro and in vivo and highlights its potential
in impacting tumor growth and recurrence. We therefore utilized a
reliable immunocompetent model of CRLM in which to study
LIGHT expression that mimics the human course of metastases
(12). We previously determined that in CRLM, the number of TIL
and LIGHTþ T cells infiltrating the tumor were very low (12). The
CD4þ and CD8þ TIL were activated compared with non-tumor
liver T cells, and the tumor microenvironment reflected a Th1 cell–
mediated immune response; however, this was not sufficient to
halt tumor growth. The majority of T cells in the tumor micro-
environment did not infiltrate the tumor margin and expressed
low levels of LIGHT (12). As LIGHT can stimulate proliferation
and activation of T cells in tumors, tumor regression, and was
associated with improved OS in CRLM, it is possible that increas-
ing LIGHT within CRLM could amplify an existing antitumor
immune response.
We initially tested the effect of soluble LIGHT on lymphocytes
and found that proliferation and activation could be profoundly
enhanced with only CD3 co-engagement. Thus, LIGHT was con-
firmed to be an immunostimulatory cytokine that could activate T
cells in a CD28-independent fashion. This property supported
further investigation in vivo, as tumor immunoediting often
inhibits or masks costimulatory signals needed to engage a T-cell
response. Therefore, we created a syngeneic LIGHT-expressing
colon cancer cell line to use an immunocompetent host system.
For clinical applicability, we distinctly did not engineer increased
expression of tumor-associated antigens, overexpress recogniz-
able epitopes, or transfer antigen-recognizing T cells into the
animal model to more accurately reflect the human course. This
would more than likely increase the difficulty of the assays,
consistency of the results, and the magnitude of antitumor
immune responses; however, critically, it would more accurately
reflect the human condition and serve as a translational preclinical
model.
Two LIGHT-expressing colon cancer cells were created and
tested, one that constitutively expressed LIGHT and another that
inducibly expressed LIGHT. With the inducible expression of
LIGHT, we could test its effect in established tumors, which would
more accurately reflect the way this intervention would be used
clinically and also allow for the same cells to be used as internal
controls. Similar to soluble LIGHT, in vitro culture of CT26LIGHT
with lymphocytes stimulated proliferation and activation, con-
firming the ability of the cell line to bind to cognate receptors on T
cells and to affect a clinical response. When splenocytes were
harvested from animals with LIGHT-expressing colon cancer
tumors, they were found to be tumor cell–specific and capable
of cytotoxic T-cell responses. Using whole-tumor 3D images, we
calculated TIL concentrations in the entire tumor, not just in a
representative slice, and found that TILs were increased in the
LIGHT-expressing tumors corresponding with significant antitu-
mor responses by both WHO and RECIST criteria. Lymphocyte
subset depletion experiments demonstrated that CD8 cytotoxic T
cells were critically responsible for in vivo antitumor immune
responses to LIGHT. To further establish that the antitumor
response was secondary to LIGHT-enhanced tumor-specific
immunity, animals exposed to LIGHT-expressing tumors were
later challenged with the WT colon tumor or an irrelevant syn-
geneic tumor. WT colon tumors grew minimally and regressed in
these animals, whereas syngeneic non–colon cancers grew unaf-
fected. In these experiments, LIGHT-induced tumor regressions
instilled tumor-specific antitumor immunity in tumors distant to
the primary, suggesting that treating tumors with immunostimu-
latory agents like LIGHT could act as a tumor vaccine preventing
establishment of future metastases. Thus, it followed that the
effect of LIGHT on the establishment of CRLM should be tested.
Subcutaneous tumors have tremendous advantages for mon-
itoring tumor progression and for assessing the effects of thera-
peutic intervention. However, a major disadvantage is that the
subcutaneous microenvironment differs from that of the liver, the
most common site of metastases. Interactions between the host
environment and the tumor determine tumor cell behavior, levels
of growth factors and nutrients, and tumor angiogenesis (36).
Thus, a metastatic CRLM model was utilized where cells metas-
tasize from a distant organ via the portal vein. The model is well-
established for these experiments, is reliable, and mimics the
human course of disease (12, 37–39). We found that enhanced
LIGHT expression in the tumor microenvironment inhibited
growth of CRLM and increased TILs and lymphocyte-homing
signals in the metastatic tumors. The impact on metastases was
impressive, and importantly, it was measured grossly, as is per-
formed in our patients with CRLM, and not by colonogenic assay,
which measures single cells in metastatic organs. Therefore, this
represents the first study that has evaluated the effect of LIGHT
expression in the tumor microenvironment on the growth of
metastatic liver tumors from a gastrointestinal/colon primary.
There are limitations to the study. In the inducible model, the
animals with LIGHT-expressing tumors received a doxycycline
diet. Therefore, we added CT26control tumor groups with an
empty vector on the same promoter that were fed doxycycline and
demonstrated significant differences in tumor regressions com-
pared with the LIGHT-expressing group and similar to the animals
fed regular chow. Furthermore, the doxycycline diet resulted in
green stool, and this was confirmed daily in the mice fed doxy-
cycline chow to insure consistent ingestion. In addition, the
amount of chow ingested daily was measured and not different
between doxycycline chow- and regular chow–fed animals. This
corresponded with measured serum levels of doxycycline
throughout the experimental time period in the experimental
groups. In addition, additional colon cancer cell lines would have
been useful to test in this model. However, the only syngeneic
Balb/c colon cancer cell line available is CT26, and the use of
other colon cancer cell lines would require an immune-incom-
petent model. Therefore, 4T1 murine mammary cancer cells were

 used in challenge experiments and as controls in cytotoxicity
assays, as has been well-established in this model. Furthermore,
LIGHT was presented in the tumor microenvironment on the
colon cancer tumor cells. The chosen model insured reliably
increased and stable levels of expression only in the tumor and
served as proof-of-principal for the experimental strategy,
although other mechanisms to deliver LIGHT into the tumors
are warranted for study and applicability in human clinical trials.
In conclusion, increasing LIGHT expression in colon cancer
cells increased T-cell proliferation and activation, resulting in
enhanced tumor-specific immune-mediated tumor regressions
in primary tumors and CRLM.
