Abstract
A bacterial etiology of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has been suspected since the beginnings of 
modern germ theory. Recent studies implicate mucosal surfaces as sites of disease initiation. The 
common occurrence of periodontal dysbiosis in RA suggests that oral pathogens may trigger the 
production of disease-specific autoantibodies and arthritis in susceptible individuals. We used 
mass spectrometry to define the microbial composition and antigenic repertoire of gingival 
crevicular fluid in patients with periodontal disease and healthy controls. Periodontitis was 
characterized by the presence of citrullinated autoantigens that are primary immune targets in RA. 
The citrullinome in periodontitis mirrored patterns of hypercitrullination observed in the 
rheumatoid joint, implicating this mucosal site in RA pathogenesis. Proteomic signatures of 
several microbial species were detected in hypercitrullinated periodontitis samples. Among these, 
Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (Aa), but not other candidate pathogens, induced 
hypercitrullination in host neutrophils. We identified the pore-forming toxin leukotoxin-A (LtxA) 
as the molecular mechanism by which Aa triggers dysregulated activation of citrullinating 
enzymes in neutrophils, mimicking membranolytic pathways that sustain autoantigen citrullination 
in the RA joint. Moreover, LtxA induced changes in neutrophil morphology mimicking 
extracellular trap formation, thereby releasing the hypercitrullinated cargo. Exposure to leukotoxic 
Aa strains was confirmed in patients with RA and was associated with both anti-citrullinated 
protein antibodies (ACPAs) and rheumatoid factor (RF). The effect of HLA-DRB1 shared epitope 
alleles on autoantibody positivity was limited to RA patients that were exposed to Aa. These 
studies identify the periodontal pathogen Aa as a candidate bacterial trigger of autoimmunity in 
RA.
Introduction
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic autoimmune disease of unknown etiology 
characterized by synovial inflammation, joint destruction, and autoantibodies against 
citrullinated proteins (ACPAs) (1). Posttranslational protein modification of RA autoantigens 
catalyzed by peptidylarginine deiminase enzymes (PADs) is thought to drive immune events 
that precipitate and propagate the disease (1, 2). However, factors that underlie loss of 
tolerance to citrullinated proteins and disease initiation in RA remain elusive.
Recent studies have suggested mucosal surfaces, specifically the periodontium, the gut, and 
the lungs, as sites of disease initiation in RA (3). Periodontal disease (periodontitis), a 
bacterial-induced chronic inflammatory disease of the periodontium, is commonly observed 
in RA, implicating periodontal pathogens as potential triggers of autoimmunity (4). 
Although multiple bacterial species are associated with periodontitis (5), the expression of a 
bacterial PAD by Porphyromonas gingivalis has focused research on this oral pathogen as a 
putative link between periodontal infection and RA (6). The roles of other keystone 
pathogens for RA have not been explored.

 Here, we studied the periodontal microenvironment in patients with periodontitis to define 
mechanisms underlying mucosal inflammation and autoimmunity in RA. Among the 
microbial species associated with periodontal disease, we identified Aggregatibacter 
actinomycetemcomitans (Aa) as the only pathogen with the ability to reproduce the 
repertoire of citrullinated antigens found in the RA joint. These studies provide a framework 
to understand autoantigen citrullination in RA as a consequence of microbial-immune cell 
interactions, and suggest bacterial pore-forming toxins as a unifying principle underlying 
abnormal activation of endogenous PADs in host target cells. As such, Aa may be a primary 
oral microbe that can trigger autoimmunity in RA.
Results
Periodontitis mirrors the antigenic microenvironment of the RA joint
To study periodontitis-associated pathogens as possible environmental triggers of 
autoimmunity in RA, we initially analyzed the antigenic composition of the periodontal 
microenvironment in patients with periodontitis and healthy controls. Gingival crevicular 
fluid (GCF) collected from the gingival sulcus, the space between the gingival mucosa and 
tooth, has been widely used to study the microbial and inflammatory components of the 
periodontal pocket (7). In periodontitis, analysis of GCF revealed extensive protein 
citrullination (Fig. 1A-B), mirroring patterns of cellular hypercitrullination previously 
observed in the RA joint (Fig. 1A, left panel) (2). Hypercitrullination was minimal in 
healthy subjects without periodontitis, where protein citrullination was limited to 
physiologic substrates such as keratins (Fig. 1A). Mass spectrometry (MS) analysis of GCF 
from patients with periodontitis and controls without periodontal disease showed 
comparable total peptide counts, but significant enrichment for inflammatory markers such 
as IgG and IgA in periodontal disease (p=0.016 and p=0.016, respectively) (Fig. 1C). In 
addition, posttranslational protein modification analysis confirmed that citrullinated proteins 
were highly enriched in periodontitis (Fig. 1D). The citrullinome of the periodontal pocket 
in periodontitis mirrored the spectrum of protein citrullination found in the RA joint, 
including major citrullinated autoantigens targeted by disease-specific autoantibodies in RA 
(citrullinated actin, α-enolase, hnRNP A2/B1 (RA33) and vimentin, among others) (Fig. 
1D) (2, 8-10).
Whereas the calcium-dependent mammalian PADs citrullinate specific arginine residues 
within polypeptide chains (endocitrullination), bacterial PAD from P gingivalis (PPAD) 
modifies only C-terminal arginines exposed after substrate cleavage by P gingivalis arginine 
gingipains (C-terminal citrullination) (11). Peptide spectra of citrullinated RA autoantigens 
detected in periodontitis GCF invariably showed peptidylarginine endocitrullination (Fig. 
1E), which is consistent with the activity of human (host), but not bacterial PADs.
The periodontal pathogen Aa induces cellular hypercitrullination in neutrophils
When analyzing GCF samples for proteomic signatures of the subgingival microbiome 
(table S1A-I), several bacterial species strongly associated with periodontal disease were 
found enriched in hypercitrullinated periodontitis samples (5); these included the “red 
complex” bacteria (P gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, Treponema denticola), “orange

 complex” bacteria (Fusobacterium nucleatum ssp., Prevotella intermedia), and Aa (Fig. 2A). 
In contrast, peptide spectra of oral commensal bacteria (Abiotrophia defectiva, 
Streptococcus intermedius) did not cluster with periodontal disease and were more common 
in the setting of oral health (Fig. 2A). We hypothesized that one or several of the 
periodontitis-associated bacterial species may hold potential to activate endogenous host 
PADs, explaining endocitrullination patterns observed in periodontal disease. To screen for 
bacterial species that activate hypercitrullination in host cells, we initially studied the effects 
of periodontal pathogens and commensals on primary human neutrophils, the major source 
of citrullinated autoantigens in RA and the predominant immune cell in the periodontal 
pocket (2, 7). Incubation of neutrophils with different Aa serotypes (serotypes a, b, and f), 
but not with other candidate pathogens of the red and orange complex or with oral 
commensals, reproduced patterns of cellular hypercitrullination observed in GCF of patients 
with periodontitis and synovial fluid of patients with RA (Fig. 2B) (2). These findings were 
further confirmed by dot blotting, which also captures low molecular weight cleavage 
products that may be acted on by P gingivalis PAD (6) (fig. S1). Citrullination was not 
detected in bacteria alone or control neutrophils (fig. S1), demonstrating that 
hypercitrullination is dependent on both bacterial factors and components of the host 
immune cell. These data highlight Aa as an oral pathogen with the potential to dysregulate 
protein citrullination in human cells.
Aa triggers hypercitrullination through its pore-forming toxin leukotoxin A
Leukotoxin A (LtxA) is the major virulence factor of Aa (12). A member of the repeats-in-
toxin (RTX) family of pore-forming proteins, LtxA induces plasma membrane 
permeabilization and unregulated calcium influx into toxin-susceptible cells (13). LtxA 
expression varies among Aa strains and correlates with periodontal disease severity in 
colonized individuals (14). We hypothesized that similar to membranolytic pathways that 
mediate hypercitrullination in the RA joint (2), transient disruption of neutrophil membrane 
integrity by LtxA may drive the dysregulated activation of PAD enzymes through influx of 
extracellular calcium. Exposure of neutrophils to live Aa cells in the presence of a blocking 
antibody against LtxA abrogated hypercitrullination, suggesting that Aa-induced 
citrullination is indeed dependent on LtxA activity (Fig. 3A). Conversely, neutrophil 
hypercitrullination was reproduced with purified LtxA protein from culture supernatants of 
Aa (Fig. 3B). Cellular hypercitrullination induced by LtxA was rapid (detectable as early as 
5 minutes into incubation) and plateaued within the first hour (Fig. 3C-D). Although the 
calcium concentration of saliva is similar to serum (1.25-1.5 mM) (15), we confirmed that 
LtxA-mediated neutrophil hypercitrullination can occur in human saliva and likely also in 
other extracellular compartments at calcium concentrations below 0.2 mM (fig. S2A and B, 
respectively).
LtxA-mediated hypercitrullination was not observed in human peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) or macrophages treated with purified LtxA (Fig. 3B and E), 
suggesting a major role for neutrophils as a primary source of citrullinated proteins induced 
by LtxA. Activation of LtxA-stimulated PBMCs was evident by trace citrullination of 
histone H3 (Fig. 3B). Degrees of histone H3 citrullination differed dramatically between 
LtxA-treated neutrophils and PBMCs despite similar expression of PAD4 (Fig. 3B). These

 qualitative differences in histone H3 citrullination have previously been observed in 
neutrophils exposed to hypercitrullinating (complement and perforin) vs non-
hypercitrullinating stimuli (LPS and PMA, among others) (2). In macrophages, LtxA 
induced citrullination of a ~45-55 kDa protein complex that likely corresponds to 
citrullinated vimentin (Fig. 3E).
LtxA generates citrullinated autoantigens targeted in RA
To define the spectrum of citrullinated proteins (the citrullinome) induced during LtxA-
mediated membranolysis, we analyzed neutrophils treated with either buffer alone of 
purified LtxA by MS (table S2 and S3, respectively). The LtxA-induced citrullinome 
showed marked overlap with the synovial fluid citrullinomes previously identified in patients 
with RA (44/86 proteins) (2, 8-10) (Fig. 4). With the exception of actin (2 vs. 311 
citrullinated spectra in control vs. LtxA-treated neutrophils), citrullinated peptides were 
exclusively detected in neutrophils treated with LtxA (table S2, S3 and Fig. 4). LtxA 
distinctly induced generation of citrullinated RA autoantigens (Fig. 4), suggesting that Aa-
mediated neutrophil damage in the context of periodontal infection may be sufficient to 
generate the antigenic determinants recognized by disease-specific autoantibodies in RA.
LtxA induces neutrophil lysis and the extracellular release of hypercitrullinated proteins
Cell death is a core process in the pathogenesis of systemic autoimmune diseases during 
which autoantigens become accessible to immune effector pathways. Whereas LtxA has 
been reported to induce target cell apoptosis and necrosis (12), immunofluorescence of 
dying neutrophils treated with purified LtxA showed DNA extrusion similar to extracellular 
traps (Fig. 5A), an antimicrobial form of neutrophil death also known as NETosis (16). 
Although neutrophil-specific cytolysis induced by LtxA can explain the formation of 
structures similar to neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) (17), we addressed whether LtxA-
induced cellular hypercitrullination may be linked to the process of NETosis. Whereas the 
inhibitor of NET formation diphenyleneiodonium (DPI) decreased histone H3 citrullination 
during both phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)- and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced 
NETosis, LtxA-induced hypercitrullination was unaffected by DPI (Fig. 5B). In contrast, the 
PAD inhibitor Cl-amidine and EDTA completely abrogated hypercitrullination induced by 
LtxA, demonstrating that this process is dependent on extracellular calcium and PAD 
activity (Fig. 5B). Unlike LtxA, conventional NET-inducing stimuli were not associated with 
hypercitrullination as previously described (2, 17, 18). Citrullination induced with these 
stimuli was restricted to protein substrates of the chromatin complex (for example, histone 
H3) (Fig. 5B).
To establish whether LtxA-mediated autoantigen production is contingent on the process of 
cytolysis and extracellular release of PADs, we analyzed neutrophils for the presence of 
citrullinated autoantigens before extrusion of their DNA (Fig. 5C). By immunofluorescence, 
ACPA-positive RA patient serum, but not control serum, detected citrullinated autoantigens 
in LtxA-exposed neutrophils that had not yet released chromatin, demonstrating that 
citrullination occurs intracellularly and not as consequence of extracellular PAD activity 
(Fig. 5C, top panels). Trace staining with RA patient serum was seen in unstimulated control 
neutrophils incubated for an equal amount of time (Fig. 5C, lower panels). This may

 represent recognition of neutrophil antigens targeted as native (unmodified) proteins in RA 
(9). Given the time to complete neutrophil lysis, hypercitrullinated cellular proteins were 
released together with neutrophil chromatin, as detected by immunofluorescence staining 
and in micrococcal nuclease digests (Fig. 5D and 5E, respectively). Hypercitrullination was 
not detectable in NETs isolated from PMA- and LPS-stimulated neutrophils (Fig. 5E).
RA is associated with exposure to leukotoxic strains of Aa
Serological quantification of antibodies against Aa and LtxA has been used as a valuable 
method to identify individuals with previous or current periodontal infection by Aa (19-22). 
Anti-Aa antibodies in patients with periodontitis show only minimal variation in titer over 
15 years of follow up (19). Even with periodontal treatment, antibodies against Aa were 
shown to remain elevated over the duration of a 30-month period (20). As such, serology is a 
powerful tool to indicate exposure to Aa. Indeed, anti-Aa antibodies reliably identified a 
periodontal disease subset that was positive for Aa DNA in subgingival plaque samples by 
PCR (fig. S3A).
To screen for Aa exposure in patients with RA, we initially assessed the prevalence of anti-
Aa antibodies in a large cohort of patients with established RA (ESCAPE RA) (23). Aa 
strains are categorized into seven antigenic groups (serotypes a-g) (14, 24). Among these, 
Aa serotype b strains are associated with high levels of leukotoxic activity (a direct marker 
of LtxA production) (14). We therefore quantified anti-Aa antibodies in patients with RA 
and controls using an Aa serotype b whole-cell ELISA. Serum anti-Aa serotype b antibodies 
were detected in 21% (41/196) of patients with RA, indicating a systemic immune response 
to this subset of Aa (fig. S3B). Anti-Aa antibodies were strikingly associated with RA when 
compared with controls without periodontitis (21% vs 3%; p<0.001) (fig. S3B).
Clinical isolates of serotype b are highly enriched in leukotoxic strains of Aa, but substantial 
variation in leukotoxicity exists among distinct serotypes and strains (14). Detection of anti-
LtxA antibodies may therefore provide a more direct estimate of immune exposure to 
leukotoxic strains independent of Aa serotype. In our cohort, 11% of controls without 
periodontitis (11/100) showed detectable antibodies against LtxA by ELISA, confirmed by 
immunoprecipitation (IP) of the radiolabelled in vitro transcribed–translated (IVTT) toxin 
(Fig. 6A and fig. S3C-D). This is consistent with the small population of healthy individuals 
that are infected with Aa, but have not developed periodontitis (21). Using the 100th 
percentile of unexposed controls as a cut-off for positivity, anti-LtxA antibodies were 
strikingly associated with RA (43% vs 11% positivity; p<0.0001), indicating infection with 
leukotoxic strains of Aa in a large subset of patients. Anti-LtxA antibodies showed 
considerable overlap with anti-Aa serotype b antibodies in RA (33/41; 80%), but identified a 
large additional patient subset that was negative by Aa serotype b ELISA (51 patients) (fig. 
S3E) and in whom alternative serotypes (non-b strains) may dominate (14). These data 
suggest that exposure to leukotoxic Aa in RA is not limited to serotype b strains commonly 
implicated in periodontitis and provide evidence of Aa infection in at least 47% (92/196) of 
patients with established RA.
Although Aa has historically been linked to localized aggressive periodontitis (LAP) in 
adolescents (25), more recent evidence suggests a previously underappreciated role in

 chronic periodontitis (26-28). Indeed, we confirmed exposure to Aa LtxA in 62% (68/109) 
of individuals with chronic periodontitis by ELISA (62% vs 11% of controls; p<0.0001) 
(Fig. 6B). Anti-LtxA antibodies were significantly associated with both mild and severe 
periodontitis, with the strongest association observed in severe periodontal disease (71% vs 
52%; p=0.012) (fig. S4A). In patients with periodontitis, amounts of anti-LtxA antibodies 
correlated with periodontal disease severity (multiple linear regression, beta=1.12; 
p<0.0001) (table S4 and fig. S4B). Together, these data support a strong clinical association 
of Aa with both RA and periodontal disease and suggest clinically relevant exposure to Aa 
in a subset of patients with established arthritis.
To define immunodominant regions targeted by the anti-LtxA antibody response, we tested 
RA patient sera against full-length and truncated constructs of LtxA by IP (Fig. 6C-D). Sera 
positive for anti-LtxA antibodies by ELISA, but not sera from ELISA-negative RA patients, 
immunoprecipitated radiolabelled full-length IVTT-LtxA (Fig. 6D). Two major regions of 
LtxA were immunoprecipitated by patient sera, namely the N-terminal transmembrane 
region (NTX, amino acids 1-408) and a C-terminal region (730-1055) that contains the 
repeats-in-toxin (RTX) motifs (Fig. 6C-D) (12). No reactivity was observed against the 
central protein region (CTR, 409-729) (Fig. 6D).
Anti-LtxA antibodies are associated with ACPA and RF positivity in patients with RA
Because Aa is a potent inducer of cellular hypercitrullination, an association between 
ACPAs and infection with leukotoxic strains of Aa is expected in patients with RA who are 
able to present citrullinated peptides. Anti-LtxA positivity in RA was significantly 
associated with the presence of ACPAs (83% vs 67%; p=0.011 in anti-LtxA antibody 
positive vs negative RA, respectively) (table S5). Moreover, this association was similarly 
observed for rheumatoid factor (RF) positivity (77% vs 57%; p=0.003) (table S5). Exposure 
to Aa was enriched in African-Americans and significantly decreased in Caucasians 
(p=0.004) (table S5), as previously reported for LAP (29).
Analyses of individual ACPA fine specificities revealed that the association with anti-LtxA 
was driven by a specific subset of citrullinated autoantigens. ACPA fine specificities 
enriched in anti-LtxA antibody positive RA patients primarily recognized citrullinated 
autoantigens generated during LtxA-induced neutrophil hypercitrullination (Table 1 and Fig. 
4). These included citrullinated hnRNP B1b (RA33), citrullinated vimentin, and citrullinated 
histone H2B, among others (Table 1). In contrast, antibodies against citrullinated 
extracellular proteins that are absent in neutrophils (such as biglycan, fibrinogen, and 
filaggrin) were not enriched in LtxA-positive RA (Table 1).
The association between LtxA positivity and RA autoantibodies was even more pronounced 
when patients were analyzed in the context of shared epitope (SE)-containing HLA-DRB1 
alleles. SE alleles are the strongest genetic risk factor for RA and convey susceptibility to 
ACPA and RF production in this disease (30, 31). In our cohort, the association of SE alleles 
with ACPAs and RF was restricted to RA patients who had evidence of LtxA exposure, but 
not maintained in anti-LtxA antibody negative patients (p-values for interaction: p=0.022 for 
ACPA positivity; p=0.022 for anti-CCP2; p=0.012 for RF) (Table 2), suggesting that the 
effect of SE susceptibility alleles on ACPAs and RF positivity in RA may be conditioned on

 the exposure to the periodontal pathogen Aa. In contrast, when we studied exposure to P 
gingivalis among patients with RA in the same cohort (fig. S5A-B), we observed no 
significant association between this pathogen, HLA-DRB1 SE alleles, and the presence of 
autoantibodies (p-values for interaction: p=0.94 for ACPA positivity; p=0.55 for anti-CCP2; 
p=0.98 for RF) (table S6). Instead, SE alleles conveyed the highest effect on seropositivity in 
anti-P gingivalis negative patients (adjusted OR of 5.7; p<0.001) (table S6).
Discussion
A microbial etiology of the autoimmune disease RA has been hypothesized for more than a 
century (32, 33). The therapeutic use of gold salts in RA was introduced based on the now-
rejected model that this disease was due to infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis of 
low virulence (34). Beyond the postulates for causation by Henle and Koch (35, 36), a large 
body of work has implicated numerous bacterial and viral infectious agents in RA 
pathogenesis, albeit inconclusively (37-39).
The evolving understanding of antigenic determinants targeted in this autoimmune disease, 
specifically the discovery of ACPAs, has facilitated the interrogation of mechanism-based 
hypotheses (1). In particular, the association of periodontal disease and lung disease such as 
bronchiectasis with RA has shaped efforts to understand how environmental factors might 
initiate loss of tolerance to citrullinated proteins in this disease (4, 40). Despite advances in 
understanding the microbial composition of the oral, gut, and lung microbiomes in RA 
(41-44), no pathogen with the capacity to reproduce the spectrum of citrullinated 
autoantigens found in the RA joint has yet been identified.
In this study, we identify Aa as an organism able to (I) drive dysregulated protein 
citrullination in host immune cells (analogous to cellular hypercitrullination in the RA joint) 
(2), and (II) generate the known antigen repertoire targeted by autoantibodies in RA. In 
contrast, hypercitrullination was not seen with P gingivalis or any other bacterial species 
studied. Unlike candidate pathogens previously implicated in RA pathogenesis, Aa provides 
a mechanism that can account for the generation of citrullinated autoantigens independent of 
molecular mimicry or bacterial citrullinating enzymes.
The study of mucosal immunity has resulted in several distinct hypotheses to explain a role 
of microbial dysbiosis in the etiology of RA. The finding that the gut microbiome can shape 
antigen-specific mucosal and systemic immunity has broadened interest in searching for 
bacterial species that promote autoimmunity in human disease. In this regard, Prevotella 
copri has recently been identified as a putative bacterium that may enhance susceptibility to 
RA (particularly in HLA-DR shared epitope-negative patients) (43). Although colonization 
with these bacteria can increase sensitivity to chemically-induced colitis in mice (43), a role 
for P copri in RA still needs experimental demonstration. Mechanistic considerations of 
protein citrullination during mucosal infection have evoked hypotheses around the bacterial 
PAD of P gingivalis (PPAD) (6, 45, 46). In vitro, PPAD can citrullinate two RA 
autoantigens, α-enolase and fibrinogen, after cleavage with bacterial arginine gingipains, 
generating truncated peptides with a single C-terminal citrulline residue (6, 11). ACPAs 
recognize endocitrullinated proteins and peptides (1); however, evidence that ACPAs can

 also bind C-terminal mono-citrullinated peptides in a citrulline-dependent fashion is lacking. 
The presentation of peptides with a single C-terminal citrulline residue may indeed be 
disfavored in RA because shared epitope containing HLA-DRB1 variants preferentially 
accommodate endocitrulline within the P4 pocket (31). Finally, molecular mimicry between 
host proteins and citrullinated microbial products has been suggested as a potential driver of 
the ACPA response (45, 47, 48). However, evidence for molecular mimicry is inconclusive 
(46, 49), and the existence of citrullinated microbial proteins as generated by P gingivalis 
has not been demonstrated in vivo.
Aa, formerly Actinobacillus (Haemophilus) actinomycetemcomitans, is a Gram-negative, 
facultative anaerobe bacterium implicated in both LAP and chronic periodontitis (25-27, 29). 
In this study, 62% of chronic periodontitis cases were associated with Aa. In patients with 
periodontitis, anti-Aa LtxA antibody amounts directly correlated with periodontal disease 
severity, supporting the idea that serological surrogates of LtxA exposure are useful 
biomarkers of clinically relevant disease (19-21). This finding is highly relevant for studying 
exposure to leukotoxic Aa strains in large cohorts of patients, whose serum is stored but 
information regarding periodontal status is often lacking. Indeed, although the presence of 
periodontitis was not defined in the ESCAPE RA cohort, using antibodies against LtxA as a 
surrogate to indicate both past and current infection, 43% of patients with RA were 
identified to be exposed to Aa. Previous studies have also noted a similar association 
between Aa and RA (50, 51). However, the absence of mechanistic insight may have limited 
interest in pursuing these findings. Exposure to Aa was initially suggested by the presence of 
antibodies against Aa DnaJ (HSP40) in RA (50). Moreover, in a recent study that used 
commercial DNA probes (micro-Ident) to identify periodontitis-associated bacteria in GCF, 
Aa was the only bacterial species enriched in the periodontal pocket of patients with RA as 
compared to non-RA controls and was detected in 17/52 (33%) patients (51). Together, the 
data from these 3 independent studies using 3 different methods for Aa detection (DNA 
probes, anti-LtxA, and anti-DnaJ antibodies) strongly support an association of Aa with a 
subset of RA patients.
We demonstrate that Aa induces hypercitrullination in neutrophils through the activity of 
LtxA, the main virulence factor of LAP (12). LtxA is a member of the RTX family of 
bacterial protein toxins expressed and secreted by a diverse group of Gram-negative 
pathogenic bacteria (52). Cellular specificity of these toxins is determined by binding to 
target cell surface receptors. The cognate receptor for LtxA is β2-integrin (CD18), which 
accounts for the selective killing of human leukocytes (53). Binding of LtxA to β2-integrin 
initiates the process of toxin-receptor clustering within lipid rafts, membrane destabilization, 
influx of extracellular calcium, and ultimately cell death (13, 54). In this study, cytotoxic 
loss of membrane integrity mediated by LtxA resulted in rapid, calcium-dependent 
hypercitrullination of neutrophil proteins that were subsequently released into the 
extracellular space. Although this process seems morphologically similar to NETosis, it has 
distinct pathogenic implications. NETosis is a process that evolved to kill pathogens (16), 
whereas virulence factors such as LtxA are used by pathogens to kill immune cells and 
enhance bacterial invasion (12, 17, 52). The finding that NET-like structures induced by 
bacterial pore-forming toxins have limited bactericidal activity underscores major biological 
differences between NETosis and neutrophil lysis induced by virulence factors (17).

 Similarly, citrullination of histones decreases their bacterial killing activity (55), which may 
explain the antimicrobial differences between hypercitrullinated proteins released from 
neutrophils killed by bacterial cytolysins and NETosis, in which citrullination is limited (2, 
17, 18). The morphological and biochemical changes induced by LtxA in neutrophils are 
consistent with cell death by leukotoxic hypercitrullination (LTH), a mechanism that 
distinguishes toxin-induced cytolytic changes from NETosis (17).
The finding that both immune-mediated membranolytic pathways in the RA joint 
(complement- and perforin-mediated pore formation) (2) and bacterial pore-forming toxins 
are prominent inducers of cellular hypercitrullination is unlikely coincidental and points to a 
central role of abnormal calcium influx into neutrophils in driving the generation of RA 
autoantigens. Membranolytic damage and cellular hypercitrullination may represent a 
unifying mechanism that initiates and sustains autoantigen production at various disease 
sites in RA. Infection with leukotoxic bacteria may thus provide the inciting inflammatory 
context driving immune events that trigger ACPA production. Of note, SE alleles were 
strongly associated with ACPAs in exposed, anti-LtxA positive RA patients, but not in 
patients that tested negative for LtxA exposure. As such, the HLA-DRB1 shared epitope 
effect on ACPA-positive disease may be contingent on infection with leukotoxic strains of 
Aa. In susceptible HLA-DRB1-SE+ individuals with periodontitis, the presentation of LtxA-
induced (endo)citrullinated peptides may initiate an antibody response against citrullinated 
proteins that become autoimmune targets in the RA joint. Although bacterial 
hypercitrullination may be primarily relevant for disease initiation at mucosal surfaces, 
immune-mediated pore-forming pathways may ultimately create positive feedback loops that 
sustain inflammation and autoimmunity in established arthritis.
Although we identified Aa as a potent inducer of cellular hypercitrullination and 
citrullinated RA autoantigens, the studies have some limitations. First, direct demonstration 
that Aa can induce an ACPA response in vivo is still needed. LtxA is a toxin that is known to 
have activity against leukocytes in primates, with no toxicity on rodent cells (64). In vivo 
studies on Aa will therefore require the development of new strategies and animal models 
that are currently not available. Second, downstream pathways activated by LtxA in 
neutrophils need further experimental investigation. Third, although we identified patients 
with RA that have been exposed to leukotoxic strains of Aa, it would be of great interest to 
examine the longitudinal association between Aa infection, ACPA production, and onset of 
symptomatic disease.
Despite its distinct role among periodontitis-associated bacteria, we anticipate that Aa is not 
the only organism able to trigger cellular hypercitrullination in neutrophils. Pore-forming 
toxins with a broad range of target cell specificities are expressed by pathogenic bacteria that 
colonize and infect various mucosal surfaces implicated in RA, such as the oral, lung, and 
gut mucosa and urothelium. These include other members of the RTX family of cytolytic 
toxins, the large-pore-forming cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (CDCs), the α-toxins, and 
β-toxins among others, some of which have well-characterized specificities for neutrophils 
and other cells of the innate and adaptive immune system (52, 56). Of note, Staphylococcus 
aureus, a pathogen that can infect the urogenital tract in RA (57), secretes the pore-forming 
toxin Panton–Valentine leucocidin, which is a potent inducer of cellular hypercitrullination

 in neutrophils (17). Bacterial pore formation as a model may also explain the association of 
RA with smoking, bronchial inflammation, and bronchiectasis (40), and deserves dedicated 
consideration. A role of Aa and pore-forming toxins in generating RA autoantigens has 
critical implications for the development of both primary preventative and therapeutic 
strategies beyond immunosuppression in this chronic autoimmune disease.
Materials and Methods
Study design
The objective of this study was to determine mechanisms of protein citrullination during 
periodontal infection, a possible trigger of RA. Serum was obtained from 196 patients who 
met the 1987 revised criteria for RA (23). Disease activity and severity were assessed at 
baseline and at two additional time points, with the final visit occurring an average of 39±4 
months after enrolment. Informed consent was obtained from all individuals as approved by 
the Johns Hopkins Institutional Review Board. Sera were also obtained from 109 patients 
with chronic periodontitis and 100 healthy controls without periodontitis according to the 
updated case definitions for population-based surveillance (58). In nine patients with chronic 
periodontitis and eight healthy controls without periodontitis, serum, GCF, and/or 
subgingival plaque were available for proteomic, PCR, and/or ELISA analysis. Samples 
from individuals with and without periodontitis were obtained from the National Institute of 
Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR), National Institutes of Health (CNS Institutional 
Review Board of the National Institutes of Health NCT01568697), and from a multi-center 
clinical study funded by the NIDCR (NCT01489839). The clinical centers involved in study 
NCT01489839 were The Forsyth Institute (Cambridge, MA), New York University College 
of Dentistry (New York, NY), Southern Illinois University School of Dental Medicine 
(Alton, IL), and the University at Buffalo, State University of New York (Amherst, NY). The 
multi-center clinical study (NCT01489839) was approved by the Institutional Review Board 
from each of the 4 recruiting centers. SF was obtained after clinically indicated 
arthrocentesis under a Partners Healthcare IRB–approved protocol.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis of ELISA groups was performed using the Mann-Whitney test for 
unpaired groups. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 6. P values 
<0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. For the analyses of data from the 
ESCAPE RA cohort, the distributions of all variables were examined according to groups 
defined by antibody status. Differences in participant characteristics between the antibody-
defined groups were compared using t-tests for normally distributed continuous variables, 
the Kruskal-Wallis test for non-normally distributed continuous variables, and the chi-square 
goodness-of-fit test or Fisher’s exact test, as appropriate, for categorical variables. Ordinary 
logistic regression was used to model the associations of the presence of any shared epitope 
alleles with autoantibody seropositivity in groups stratified by presence of anti-LtxA or anti-
Pg, with differences modeled by introducing shared epitope × anti-LtxA or shared epitope × 
anti-Pg interaction terms into the models. Multivariable models were constructed by 
introducing covariates that were associated with seropositivity in univariate models at the

 p<0.20 level. Statistical calculations were performed using Intercooled Stata 12 (StataCorp). 
A two-tailed α of 0.05 was used throughout.
Significance of differences in mean clinical and demographic parameters between 
periodontally healthy and periodontitis subjects was tested using t-test. Significance of 
differences between these groups for median levels of Anti-LtxA antibodies was tested using 
Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test. Because there were statistically significant differences between 
clinical groups for age, gender, and race, and serum samples from the periodontally healthy 
group came from two distinct studies, we also applied a multiple linear regression model for 
Log Anti-LtxA as the outcome variable, adjusting for race, age, gender, and study. Statistical 
analyses were conducted using SAS software.

 Fig. 1. The periodontal microenvironment in patients with periodontitis recreates the antigenic 
repertoire of the RA joint
(A) GCF from patients with periodontitis (PD) and without PD (No PD) was analyzed by 
anti-modified citrulline (AMC) immunoblotting to detect citrullination (right panel) (60). 
Histone H3 (H3) is shown to demonstrate loading. AMC of RA and osteoarthritis (OA) 
synovial fluid cells (SF) is shown for comparison (top left panel). Actin was used to 
demonstrate loading. (B) Hypercitrullination in PD and No PD samples from A was 
quantified by chemiluminescence. Red lines represent mean values±SEM (Mann-Whitney 
test). (C) GCF was analyzed by MS. Exclusive spectrum counts in GCF samples from 
patients with PD and No PD are shown for total protein, myeloperoxidase (MPO), 
immunoglobulin (Ig) gamma-1 chain, and Ig alpha chain. Data are expressed as mean±SD. 
(Mann-Whitney test). (D) GCF samples were analyzed by MS to detect citrullinated 
peptides. Hierarchical clustering of citrullinated proteins (pink) in GCF from patients with 
PD and No PD as compared to RA SF (2, 8-10). Native peptides are shown in black, and

 Fig. 2. Aa, but not other periodontal pathogens or oral commensal bacteria, induces cellular 
hypercitrullination in neutrophils
(A) Hierarchical clustering of bacterial peptides from periodontal pathogens and 
commensals as identified by MS in individual GCF samples. Relative abundance of total 
bacterial spectra across samples is shown (yellow=high abundance; black=low abundance). 
Specific peptides identified for individual bacterial species are listed in table S1. (B) Aa 
HK1651 (serotype b), Aa CU1000 (serotype f), Aa SUNY Ab75 (serotype a), red complex 
bacteria, orange complex bacteria, and oral commensals were grown in liquid culture and 
adjusted by optical density (OD600=0.350). Increasing amounts of bacteria were incubated 
with human neutrophils at neutrophil:bacteria (PMN:B) ratio of 1:10 to 1:100. Citrullination 
was visualized by AMC immunoblotting (top panels). Detection of myeloperoxidase (MPO) 
is shown to demonstrate loading (bottom panels). MPO degradation was seen with the 
highest amount of P gingivalis bacteria (PMN:P gingivalis ratio=1:100); this was likely a 
consequence of proteolytic cleavage after lysis of neutrophils in SDS buffer. The 
experiments were performed on three separate occasions with similar results.

 Fig. 3. The pore-forming toxin of Aa induces cellular hypercitrullination in neutrophils
(A) Human neutrophils (PMNs) and Aa HK1651 cells were incubated alone or co-incubated 
in the presence or absence of a blocking antibody against LtxA (αLtxA) for 1 h at 37°C. 
Total citrullinated protein (AMC), citrullinated H3 (citH3), and histone H3 (H3) (loading 
control) were detected by immunoblotting. (B) PMNs and PBMCs were incubated with 
increasing concentrations of purified LtxA (0-1.0 μg/mL) for 1 h at 37°C. AMC and citH3 
by immunoblotting are shown. H3 and PAD4 were visualized to demonstrate loading. (C) 
PMNs were incubated with purified LtxA (0.3 μg/mL) at 37°C for 0-60 min. PMNs 
incubated with LtxA + 5 mM EGTA for 60 min were used as controls. AMC and proteinase 
3 (PR3) (loading control) were detected by immunoblotting. (D) Total citrullinated protein at 
each time point in C was quantified by densitometry (mean optical density ±SEM). Data are 
from two independent experiments. (E) Human monocyte-derived macrophages were 
incubated with increasing amounts of purified LtxA (0-1.0 μg/mL) for 3 h at 37°C. AMC 
and H3 (loading control) by immunoblotting are shown. The experiments in A, B, and E 
were performed on at least 3 separated occasions, with similar results.

 Fig. 4. The citrullinome induced by LtxA in neutrophils overlaps with the spectrum of 
citrullinated proteins in the RA joint
Citrullinated proteins in neutrophils stimulated with purified LtxA (PMN-LtxA) or buffer 
alone (PMN-Control) were identified by MS analysis and compared to published data of the 
citrullinome in RA SF (2, 8-10). Citrullinated proteins are shown in pink, and known 
citrullinated RA autoantigens are highlighted in green. Native peptides identified are shown 
in black; proteins for which no peptides were identified or previously reported are shown in 
gray. Actin was the only protein that was found to be citrullinated at baseline (2 vs. 311 
citrullinated spectra in control vs. LtxA-treated neutrophils).

 Fig. 5. RA patient sera recognize LtxA-induced autoantigens in hypercitrullinated neutrophils 
and extracellular traps
(A) Neutrophils were incubated alone (control) or with 0.3 μg/mL LtxA. After 3 h, cells 
were fixed, permeabilized, and stained for DNA with DAPI and SYTOX Green. LtxA 
induced the extracellular release of neutrophil DNA (arrowheads). (B) Neutrophils were 
incubated with/without PMA, P gingivalis (Pg)-LPS, or LtxA in the absence or presence of 
DPI, Cl-A, or EDTA. After 3 h, samples were analyzed by immunoblotting to detect 
hypercitrullination (AMC), citrullinated histone H3 (citH3), and MPO (loading control). (C) 
Neutrophils were stimulated for 1 h with LtxA (upper and middle panels) or buffer alone 
(bottom panels). After fixation/permeabilization, cells were stained with DAPI, anti-citH3 to 
visualize hypercitrullinated neutrophils (red), and ACPA-positive RA serum (green) to detect 
RA autoantigens (top and bottom panels). Healthy donor serum (HC) was used as a control 
(middle panels). (D) LtxA-stimulated neutrophils were incubated for 3 h to allow lysis. 
Fixed/permeabilized cells were stained to visualize DNA (DAPI) and autoantigens (ACPA-
positive RA serum; green). (E) AMC immunoblot of proteins recovered by micrococcal 
nuclease (MN) digestion from neutrophils stimulated with PMA, Pg-LPS, LtxA, or buffer 
alone (3 h). The experiments were performed on at least 3 separate occasions, with similar 
results. Scale bars 10 μm.

 Fig. 6. Antibodies to Aa and LtxA are enriched in patients with RA
(A) Antibodies against LtxA in patients with RA (n=196) and healthy controls without 
periodontitis (No PD; n=100). Red line indicates mean IgG concentration; dotted line marks 
the cut-off for positivity as confirmed by IVTT-IP (fig. S3D). (B) Antibodies against LtxA in 
patients with periodontitis (PD; n=109) and No PD controls (n=100). Red line indicates 
mean IgG concentration; dotted line marks the cut-off for positivity. Mann-Whitney test was 
used for statistical comparison. (C) Truncated proteins in relation to functional domains of 
LtxA. N-terminal LtxA (NTX) (AA 1-408) comprises the transmembrane regions of the 
Repeat-in-toxin N-terminal domain (RTX-NTD). C-terminal LtxA (CTX) (409-1055) 
includes the central and C-terminal regions (CTR and CTS, respectively). CTR (409-729) 
contains the acylation sites. CTS (730-1055) contains the RTX motifs and the RTX C-
terminal domain (RTX-CTD). (D) Characterization of immunodominant regions recognized 
by anti-LtxA antibodies in RA. Immunoprecipitation of IVTT-radiolabeled full length LtxA 
(LtxA FL) and truncated proteins (NTX, CTX, CTR, and CTS) using RA patient sera 
positive (n=6; 01-06) or negative (n=6; 07-12) for anti-LtxA by ELISA. Each lane 
corresponds to an individual patient’s serum. The same pattern of binding was observed in 
two independent experiments.
