With increasing incidence and mortality, cancer is the leading cause of death in China and is a major public health problem.
Because of China’s massive population (1.37 billion), previous national incidence and mortality estimates have been limited to
small samples of the population using data from the 1990s or based on a specific year. With high-quality data from an additional
number of population-based registries now available through the National Central Cancer Registry of China, the authors ana-
lyzed data from 72 local, population-based cancer registries (2009-2011), representing 6.5% of the population, to estimate the
number of new cases and cancer deaths for 2015. Data from 22 registries were used for trend analyses (2000-2011). The
results indicated that an estimated 4292,000 new cancer cases and 2814,000 cancer deaths would occur in China in 2015,
with lung cancer being the most common incident cancer and the leading cause of cancer death. Stomach, esophageal, and
liver cancers were also commonly diagnosed and were identified as leading causes of cancer death. Residents of rural areas
had significantly higher age-standardized (Segi population) incidence and mortality rates for all cancers combined than urban
residents (213.6 per 100,000 vs 191.5 per 100,000 for incidence; 149.0 per 100,000 vs 109.5 per 100,000 for mortality,
respectively). For all cancers combined, the incidence rates were stable during 2000 through 2011 for males (10.2% per year;
P 5 .1), whereas they increased significantly (12.2% per year; P < .05) among females. In contrast, the mortality rates since
2006 have decreased significantly for both males (21.4% per year; P < .05) and females (21.1% per year; P < .05). Many of the
estimated cancer cases and deaths can be prevented through reducing the prevalence of risk factors, while increasing the
effectiveness of clinical care delivery, particularly for those living in rural areas and in disadvantaged populations. CA Cancer J

Introduction
Cancer incidence and mortality have been increasing in China, making cancer the leading cause of death since 2010 and a
major public health problem in the country.1 Much of the rising burden is attributable to population growth and ageing and to
sociodemographic changes. Although previous estimates of the national incidence rates have been reported, they either repre-
sented a small sample of the Chinese population (<2%)2 or were based on data from a specific year.3,4 This has a bearing on
the uncertainty of the estimates and their degree of national representativeness and, thus, would potentially limit the evidence
available to develop appropriate policies for effective cancer control. Because the previous Program of Cancer Prevention and
Control in China (2004-2010)5 was released more than 10 years ago, a more complete picture of the national and regional
scale and profile in China would provide greater clarity in prioritizing and developing specific policies and programs across the
spectrum of cancer control aimed at reducing the burden and suffering from the disease at the national level.

 This study reports the most recent cancer incidence,
mortality, and survival estimates nationally; the most recent
incidence and mortality patterns for several major cancers
by geographic area in China; and temporal trends for some
major cancers as well as the implications of this information
for cancer control in China.
Data Sources and Methods
Cancer Registration in China
The National Central Cancer Registry of China (NCCR),
established in 2002, is responsible for the collection, evalua-
tion, and publication of cancer data in China. Cancer diagno-
ses are reported to local cancer registries from multiple
sources, including local hospitals and community health cen-
ters as well as the Urban Resident Basic Medical Insurance
program and the New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme.
Since 2002, the implementation of standard registration prac-
tices has seen a marked improvement in the quality of cancer
registration in China. In 2008, the National Program of
Cancer Registries was launched by the Ministry of Health of
China through a central financing mechanism. Since then,
the number of local population-based registries in China has
increased from 54 in 2008 (population coverage of 110 mil-
lion) to 308 (population coverage of 300 million) in 2014.3
Not all of these registries currently have sufficiently high
data quality for reporting purposes. The quality of submitted
data for each local registry was checked and evaluated by the
NCCR based on the Guidelines for Chinese Cancer Registra-
tion6 and International Agency for Research on Cancer/Inter-
national Association of Cancer Registries (IARC/IACR)
data-quality criteria.7 The assessments of quality measures
include, but are not limited to, the proportion of morphologic
verification (MV%), the percentage of cancer cases identified
with death certification only (DCO%), the mortality(M) to
incidence (I) ratio (M/I), the percentage of uncertified cancer
(UB%), and the percentage of cancer with undefined or
unknown primary site (CPU%). Only data from those local
registries that consistently met appropriate levels of quality
were included in these analyses. Detailed quality categories of
the registry data can be found in a previous publication (Table
1).8 Data classified as category A or B were deemed acceptable
for inclusion in this study. The proportions of cancer registries
that submitted data sets and were accepted for inclusion var-
ied by year of submission, from 69.2% (72 of 104 registries) in
2009,9 to 66.2% (145 of 219 registries) in 2010,4 and 75.6%
(177 of 234 registries) in 2011.3 We included data from the
72 cancer registries that were available for all 3 years.
Cancer Incidence Data
To estimate the numbers of new cancers in China in 2015,
we used the most recent data (cancer cases registered during
2009-2011) from 72 local population-based cancer registries
(Table 1), providing a population coverage of about 85.5
million people, about 6.5% of the national population. A
much smaller number of registries (n 5 22) (Table 1), which
provided a population coverage of 44.4 million, had data of
sufficient quality over the 12-year period (2000-2011) for
inclusion in incidence trend analyses. The locations of these
2 sets of cancer registries can be found in Figure 1.
We included invasive tumors only in this study, and multi-
ple primary cancers were defined using the international rules

 for multiple primary cancers.10 Incidence data were extracted
from the NCCR database. Although cancer site information
is available through codes from both the International Classifi-
cation of Diseases for Oncology, 3rd revision (ICD-O-3), and
the International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision
(ICD-10), we have reported incidence data using the ICD-10
classification for consistency, with mortality data that were
only available in the ICD-10 classification. The variables
extracted were sex, age, date of birth, year of diagnosis, cancer
site, morphology, residence (urban and rural areas), and region
(North China, Northeast, East China, Central China, South
China,
Southwest,
Northwest
China).

 incidence analysis, 5 broad age groups were used (younger
than 30 years, 30-44 years, 45-59 years, 60-74 years, and 75
years or older).
Cancer Mortality Data
Mortality data compiled by 72 local cancer registries were
used to estimate the numbers of cancer deaths in China in
2015. To estimate trends in mortality because of cancer
between 2000 and 2011, mortality data were obtained from
the same 22 local registries that were used in the incidence
trend analyses. These registries compile data on cancer deaths
from local hospitals, community health centers, vital statistics
(including data from the national Disease Surveillance Points
[DSP] system), and the Civil Administration Bureau.11 The
DSP system, which was established by the Ministry of Health
in the early 1980s, routinely collects information on deaths
based on the death certificate provided by hospitals or
obtained from the next of kin by a household visit if a death
certificate was unavailable.11 While the DSP uses a nationally
representative sample of sites, these cover only a very small
(�1%) proportion of the population.12,13
Cancer Survival
In the absence of precise follow-up information from the
72 cancer registries, estimates of 5-year relative survival in
China for 2015 are presented in this report using the com-
plement of the cancer M/I ratio (1-M/I) from these regis-
tries, a method that has been used previously.14,15 We
present these survival estimates only for all cancers com-
bined, because survival from certain cancer types may have
led to an overestimation or underestimation using this
proxy measure.14 We calculated the M/I ratio for all cancers
combined by assuming that the ratio between incidence and
mortality has not changed between 2009 to 2011 and 2015,
so we divided the age-standardized mortality rate (2009-
2011) by the age-standardized incidence rate (2009-2011).
Population Data
National population data by 5-year age group and sex were
obtained from statistics or public security census (data.stats.
gov.cn/; accessed April 20, 2014).8 Individual registries pro-
vided population data in the respective areas to the NCCR.
These data were sourced from local Statistical or Public
Security Bureaus or from calculations based on census data.
Statistical Analysis
We estimated the numbers of new cases in China in 2015 for
all cancers combined and for 26 individual cancer types by sex
by applying age-specific incidence rates from 72 cancer regis-
tries (2009-2011) to the projected age-specific population in
China in 2015. We estimated the numbers of cancer deaths in
China in 2015 using the same method. For the 10 most
common cancers, these estimated numbers of new cases and
cancer deaths were further stratified by urban/rural registries
and by 7 administrative regions that cover China. Age-
specific numbers of new cases and cancer deaths by 5 broad
age groups (younger than 30 years, 30-44 years, 45-59 years,
60-74 years, and 75 years or older) are also presented for all
cancers combined and for the 6 most common cancers for
2015.
Temporal trends in incidence and mortality rates from 2000
to 2011 (22 registries) were examined by fitting joinpoint
models16,17 to the log-transformed, age-standardized rates
(per 100,000 population), standardized according to the world
standard population.18 To reduce the possibility of reporting
spurious changes in trends over the period, all models were
restricted to a maximum of 2 joinpoints (3 line segments).
Trends were expressed as an annual percentage change (APC),
and the Z test was used to assess whether the APC was statis-
tically different from zero. In describing trends, the terms
“increase” or “decrease” were used when the slope (APC) of
the trend was statistically significant (P< .05). For nonstatisti-
cally significant trends, the term “stable” was used. For all
those analyses, we present the results for all cancers combined
and for the 10 most common cancers stratified by sex.
Results
Data Quality
The 3 main measures (MV%, DCO%, and M/I ratio) of
data quality for population-based cancer registries, stratified
by cancer type, show that overall data quality is reasonably
good for both sets of cancer registries (Fig. 2). Because half
of the 22 cancer registries are certified by the IARC, their
data quality was considerably higher than when considering
data from the combined 72 cancer registries, indicated by
higher MV% and lower DCO%. Values of these data-
quality measures plus UB% (the percentage of uncertified
cancer) and CPU% (the percentage of cancer with unde-
fined or unknown primary site) are presented Supporting
Table 1 (see online supporting information).
Expected Cancer Incidence in 2015
It is predicted that there will be about 4292,000 newly
diagnosed invasive cancer cases in 2015 in China, corre-
sponding to almost 12,000 new cancer diagnoses on aver-
age each day. The 5 most commonly diagnosed cancers
among men, in descending order, are: cancers of the lung
and bronchus, stomach, esophagus, liver, and colorectum,
accounting for about two-thirds of all cancer cases. The
corresponding cancers among women are breast, lung and
bronchus, stomach, colorectum, and esophagus, account-
ing for nearly 60% of all cases. Breast cancer alone is
expected to account for 15% of all new cancers in women
(Table 2).
Cancer Statistics in China, 2015

CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians
 The estimated incidence rates for all cancers combined
and the number of new cases for the most common 10 can-
cer types by urban versus rural status and region of resi-
dence are presented in Table 3. For all cancers combined,
the age-standardized incidence rates per 100,000 popula-
tion per year are higher in men than in women (234.9 vs
168.7 per 100,000) and are higher in rural areas than in
urban areas (213.6 vs 191.5 per 100,000). Southwest China
has the highest cancer incidence rates, followed by North
China and Northwest China; and Central China has the
lowest incidence rate.
Expected Cancer Mortality in 2015
It is estimated that about 2814,000 Chinese will die from
cancer in 2015, corresponding to over 7500 cancer deaths
on average per day. The 5 leading causes of cancer death
among both men and women are cancers of the lung and
bronchus, stomach, liver, esophagus, and colorectum,
accounting for about three-quarters of all cancer deaths
(Table 2). Similar to the incidence rates, the age-
standardized mortality rate for all cancers combined is sub-
stantially higher in men than in women (165.9 vs 88.8 per
100,000) and in rural areas than in urban areas (149.0 vs

 109.5 per 100,000) (Table 4). Likewise, the highest cancer
mortality rates were found in Southwest China, followed
by North China and Northwest China, with Central China
exhibiting the lowest rate.
Age-Specific Incidence and Mortality of Selected
Cancers by Sex in 2015
Before the age of 60 years, liver cancer is the most com-
monly diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer
death in men, followed by lung and stomach cancer, which
are the dominant types of cancer for both cases and deaths
in the group ages 60 to 74 years (Table 5). Lung cancer is
the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the leading cause
of cancer death in men aged 75 years or older. Most new
cancer cases and cancer deaths in men occur in the age
range from 60 to 74 years.
Among women, thyroid cancer is the most commonly
diagnosed cancer before the age of 30 years, followed by
breast cancer at ages 30 to 59 years, and lung cancer in
women aged 60 years or older (Table 5). Breast cancer is
the leading cause of cancer death in women younger than
45 years, followed by lung cancer. The largest proportion of
new cancer cases and deaths among women are diagnosed
among those between ages 60 and 74 years.
Expected Cancer Survival in 2015
It is predicted that, for all cancers combined, 36.9% of can-
cer patients in China will survive at least 5 years after diag-
nosis around 2015, with women having much better
survival than men (47.3% vs 29.3%) (Table 6). There is
substantial variation in the 5-year survival estimate accord-
ing to residence at the time of diagnosis: rural patients have
much lower survival than their city counterparts (30.3% vs
42.8%). Likewise, the lowest survival rates were found in
Southwest China (24.9%), with Central China showing
the highest rate (41.0%).
Trends in Cancer Incidence and Mortality
For all cancers combined, the age-standardized incidence
rates were stable over the study period (2000-2011) for
males, while significant upward trends were observed for
females (P < .05) (Fig. 3, Table 7). In contrast, the age-
standardized mortality rates decreased significantly for both
males and females (Fig. 3, Table 8). Despite this favorable
trend, however, the number of cancer deaths substantially
increased (73.8% increase) during the corresponding period
(from 51,090 in 2000 to 88,800 in 2011) because of the
aging and growth of the population (Fig. 4).

 Among the 10 most common cancers considered in the
temporal trend analyses for men, incidence rates from 2000
to 2011 increased for 6 cancer types (pancreas, colorectum,
brain and central nervous system, prostate, bladder, and
leukemia), whereas the rates decreased for cancers of the
stomach, esophagus, and liver (P < .05). A stable trend was
observed for cancer of the lung (Fig. 5, Table 7).
For women, 6 of the 10 most common cancers had a signifi-
cant upward trend in age-standardized incidence rates (cancers
of the colorectum, lung, breast, cervix, uterine corpus, and thy-
roid; P< .05). As with men, a downward trend was seen for
cancers of the stomach, esophagus, and liver (Fig. 6, Table 7).
An upward trend in age-standardized mortality rates was
observed for 4 of the 10 most common cancers in men (color-
ectum, pancreas, prostate, and leukemia; P< .05), whereas sta-
ble trends were seen for other cancer types (cancers of the lung,
bladder, and brain) (Fig. 7, Table 8). In women, an increasing
trend in mortality was observed for 3 of the 10 most common
cancers (breast, cervix, and ovary), with trends stable for color-
ectum, lung, uterine, and thyroid cancers (Fig. 8, Table 8).
Similar to the trends in cancer incidence rates, declining
trends in age-standardized mortality rates were observed
for cancers of the stomach, esophagus, and liver in both
sexes (Figs. (7 and 8)). Stable trends were observed in both
men and women for lung cancer, which was the leading
cause of cancer mortality for both men and women.
Discussion
Although national estimates of cancer for China have been
previously reported, these are limited to only a snapshot of
the patterns by cancer site during a single year3,4,12,19 or are
reported for specific cancers,20–22 making comparisons of
trends across cancer types difficult. This study provided

 Thus, the updated nationwide estimates of cancer burden and
time trends presented here are critical to understanding the
etiology of cancer and the effectiveness of prevention, early
detection, and management of cancer in China. These results
will also serve as a baseline for future assessment of the
overall effectiveness of the cancer control effort in China and
will provide insights into the areas of greatest need for
prioritization.
Because of China’s large population size, approximately
one-fifth of the world population, these Chinese data con-
tribute significantly to the global burden of cancer: almost
22% of global new cancer cases and close to 27% of global
cancer deaths occur in China.23 More importantly, the can-
cer profile in China is markedly different from those of
developed countries. The 4 most common cancers diag-
nosed in China were lung, stomach, liver, and esophageal
cancer. These cancers account for 57% of cancers diagnosed
in China, compared with 18% in the United States.24 Also,
these cancers diagnosed in China comprise between one-
third and one-half of the global incidence burden from
lung, stomach, liver, and esophageal cancers.23,25 In com-
parison, the most common cancers diagnosed in the United
States are cancers of the lung, breast, prostate, and colorec-
tum.26 The most common cancers in China are those asso-
ciated with rather poor survival; whereas those in the
United States, with the exception of lung cancer, are domi-
nated by cancers with a good to excellent prognosis, and,
for prostate and breast cancers, the incidence may be
inflated by diagnostic activities linked to early detection
and screening.24,27 This difference in cancer type distribu-
tion contributes significantly to the higher overall cancer
mortality rate in China.
Our cancer estimates for 2015 were based on data from
72 Chinese population-based cancer registries capturing
cancer diagnoses from 2009 to 2011. These registries cover
only about 6.5% of the Chinese national population, but
they remain the best-available nationwide data for cancer
incidence, representing a base population of 85.5 million
people. Moreover, the data used in this study have an
enlarged population coverage compared with previous

CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians
 studies (with coverage less than 2% of the population),2,28
including more registries in the western regions of China
and are thus more representative of the general population
in China. In addition, all 12 population-based cancer regis-
tries in mainland China with high-quality data that fulfilled
the Cancer Incidence in Five Continents (CI5) inclusion cri-
teria for the present CI5 volume X were included in the
analysis.29 These national incidence estimates for China are
broadly comparable to those published previously.3,4,12 The
2 most recently published annual reports in China found
that the estimated number of new cancer cases were 3.09
million and 3.37 million for 2010 and 2011, respectively.3,4
An earlier estimate was 2.96 million for 2005, although a
different method was used.12
Our estimate of cancer incidence for 2015 (4.29 million
cases) in China is considerably higher than that reported by
the GLOBOCAN 2012 initiative of 3.40 million.23,25 Rea-
sons for these discrepancies may include differences in data
timelines (2009-2011 vs 2003-2007) and representativeness
and geographic coverage (72 cancer registries covering
6.5% of the national population vs 23 cancer registries cov-
ering 3.0% of the population). In particular, rural residents,
who have a higher incidence rate than urban residents
(213.6 per 100,000 vs 191.5 per 100,000), account for
32.7% the population in our estimates compared with
21.5% in the 2012 GLOBOCAN estimates. The methods
used to obtain the national incidence estimates are also dif-
ferent, because GLOBOCAN 2012 converts national mor-
tality estimates for 2012 to incidence by modeling the age-
specific, sex-specific, and site-specific M/I ratios from the
23 Chinese cancer registries. While acknowledging that
not all of these cancer registries met the IARC quality
standards,15,30 these discrepancies in published estimates
underscore the need for further improvements in the cover-
age and quality of registries in China to provide more accu-
rate statistics on the cancer burden in the country.
In contrast to incidence, there was greater consistency in
our mortality estimates and those in GLOBOCAN. We
estimated that there would be 2.81 million cancer deaths in
2015, and the corresponding figure was 2.46 million in
GLOBOCAN 2012.23 This may reflect that the mortality
data used by both studies were obtained from a similar
source: DSP data (2004-2010) were used for GLOBO-
CAN 2012, while we used mortality data collected from

 72 cancer registry areas (2009-2011) for which DSP data
were part of the whole set of data on cancer deaths. The
DSP data were based on counties and stratified by geo-
graphic regions, with sampling further stratified by urban
or rural location and per capita gross domestic product, and
the DSP system was specifically designed to be nationally
representative.19 For both incidence and mortality esti-
mates, data from Hong Kong and Macao were also used in
the estimates from GLOBOCAN 2012 but were excluded
from our analyses.
We found significant differences in cancer incidence rates
for all cancers combined by place of residence (rural vs urban
and between regions) in China. Rural residents have higher
incidence compared with their urban counterparts, and inci-
dence rates varied substantially across the 7 administrative
regions. It is likely that many factors contribute to this geo-
graphic differential, but the higher smoking prevalence in
rural populations compared with those in urban areas31,32
likely plays a dominating role. The 12 cancers formally estab-
lished as being caused by smoking33 account for about 75%
of all cancers combined in China. Consistent with this
hypothesis, the area with the highest observed cancer inci-
dence rate, Southwest China, was also reported to have the
cities with the highest smoking prevalence in 2002.34
We found even greater geographic variations in cancer
mortality and the survival proxies across China. It is likely
that at least part of these geographic disparities could be
explained by the more limited medical resources, lower levels
of cancer care, and a larger proportion of patients diagnosed
with cancer at a late stage in rural and underdeveloped areas
in China.27 Recognizing that differences in other factors,
such as competing causes of death and comorbidities, may
also contribute, the results reported here, together with those
reported previously,27,35 provide a strong justification for
providing more government-funded health resources and
services for cancer control in rural and underdeveloped areas
in China to reduce these apparent inequalities.
There has been a marked increase in the numbers of can-
cers diagnosed in China between 2000 and 2011. Much of
this is explained by the aging and growth of the population.
Other factors that may have contributed to the increase in the
burden of cancer include increases in the prevalence of unheal-
thy behaviors or cancer-related lifestyle and improvements in
disease awareness, detection services, and data completeness.
The largest increase in incidence was seen for cancers of the
prostate, cervix, and thyroid for women. The factors driving
the increase in prostate cancer are not entirely understood;
however, they may include gradual implementation of
prostate-specific antigen screening and improved biopsy tech-
niques36 or the impact of an increasingly westernized life-
style.37,38 Westernized lifestyle, particularly increases in the
prevalence of obesity and physical inactivity in recent decades
in China, is likely to have had an impact on the observed rise
in colorectal and breast cancer incidence.39,40 For breast
cancer, the increasing trend may also reflect changes in repro-
ductive behavior in China in recent decades because of the
one-child policy implemented since the 1970s.41
In contrast to the decreasing incidence trends in devel-
oped countries, a substantial increase in cervical cancer inci-
dence was seen in China. This may reflect the inadequacy
of Papanicolaou (Pap) test screening in China, because only
one-fifth of Chinese women reported having ever had a
Pap test for cervical cancer screening.42,43 The increasing
prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, espe-
cially in younger women,44,45 and the lack of HPV vaccines
in mainland China due to the absence of formal drug
approvals,39 suggest that the disparity in cervical cancer
incidence trends between China and international countries
may continue for the foreseeable future.
The dramatic rise in thyroid cancer among women is
consistent with that observed in other countries46–49; and,
while it may reflect “overdiagnosis” through increased use

 tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging) in the
assessment of the thyroid gland,50,51 in the absence of
information about disease stage, it is not possible to rule
out a real increase in incidence.
A significantly decreasing incidence and mortality trend
was observed for cancers of the stomach, esophagus, and
liver in China. Despite the declining rates for this group of
cancers, population growth and ageing still led to a large
and rising number of new cases in 2015. Control of infec-
tions may contribute for these temporal patterns, including
hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) for
liver cancer and Helicobacter pylori for stomach cancer.52
Primary prevention of HBV infection through vaccination
of infants has been shown to be effective: liver cancer
deaths were reduced by 95% for the younger population
(ages 0-19 years) 15 years after implementing HBV vacci-
nation program in high-risk areas in China in 1986.53
Despite the success of HBV vaccine to prevent liver cancer
in children in China,53,54 it may be too early to affect the
incidence trend for all ages combined. Factors that may
have contributed to the decreasing trend in overall liver
cancer rates in China include a reduction in the consump-
tion of corn contaminated with aflatoxins and improved
quality of drinking water by removal of cyanotoxins from
water sources.55 The single-child policy, which reduces the
horizontal (child–to-child) transmission of HBV infection
at home, and safer injection practices, which reduce

 nosocomial HBV and HCV,56 may also have contributed
to the decrease in overall liver cancer rates.
Implications for Cancer Prevention in China
It has been estimated that nearly 60% of cancer deaths can be
avoided by reducing exposure to modifiable risk factors.57 The
largest contributor to avoidable cancer deaths in China is
chronic infection, which is estimated to account for 29% of
cancer deaths, predominantly from stomach cancer (H. pylori),
liver cancer (HBV and HCV), and cervical cancer (HPV).
Tobacco smoking accounted for about 23%57 to 25%58
of all cancer deaths in China; yet over one-half of adult
Chinese men were current smokers in 2010,31 and smoking
rates in adolescents and young adults are still rising.59 Even
if current rates remain stable, it has been estimated that the
one million smoking-related deaths in China annually

 during the 2010s will double by 2030.60 With the impact
of smoking-related disease becoming evident 20 to 30
years after the onset of smoking,61 it is likely that the
burden of cancer in China will continue to increase in
the next decades irrespective of changes in tobacco-
control programs. Although, at present, there remains a
generally positive image of smoking in China62 with
heavy
exposure
to
tobacco
promotion,63
legislative
changes have been enforced,64 including strict smoking-
control laws taking effect in Beijing in June 2015.65 If
implemented on a national scale, and if the tobacco
industry can be separated from the government tobacco-
control activities,66 then these changes have the potential
to provide hope that subsequent generations of Chinese
will benefit from a much lower burden of tobacco-related
cancers.

 The economic growth and increasingly urbanized and
westernized lifestyle experienced in China has resulted in
increased environmental pollution.39 Outdoor air pollution,
considered to be among the worst in the world,67 indoor air
pollution through heating and cooking using coal and other
biomass fuels, and the contamination of soil and drinking
water mean that the Chinese population is exposed to
many environmental carcinogens. While the measured
attributable
risk
for
environmental
pollution
is
low
(<1.0%),57 the existence of “cancer villages” in China that
have particularly high cancer incidence and mortality pro-
vides strong circumstantial evidence for an association.39,68
Some efforts are being made to reduce the burden of envi-
ronmental pollution in China68,69; however, the gap
between legislation and implementation remains high. The
impact of environmental pollution on cancer and other
health outcomes is likely to be felt for many decades in
China, particularly for people in rural areas who are facing
very rudimentary living environments.
Implications for Early Detection and Management
in China
Although prevention efforts are critical to reduce the long-
term burden of cancer, any effects will not be seen in the
near future.70 For this reason, facilitating the earlier diagno-
sis of cancer and improving the access and availability of
optimal treatments may hold the greatest potential to have a
more immediate impact on the existing burden of cancer in
China. In particular, the large survival differences by geo-
graphic region27 demonstrate the potential to improve the
survival of Chinese cancer patients through ensuring equita-
ble timeliness of diagnosis, access to cancer care, and quality
of care delivered irrespective of where a person resides.
One barrier to addressing these issues is the immense
scale of the Chinese population and its geographic diversity.
Even with the current rate of expansion for breast screening
programs, it would take an estimated additional 40 years to
screen each women in the target age group once.70 In addi-
tion, the younger median age at breast cancer diagnosis
compared with high-income countries limits its cost effec-
tiveness, with some suggestions that Chinese resources
might be better targeted in raising awareness and early
detection when detecting breast lumps.71 Despite these
geographic and population barriers, endoscopy screening
programs for esophageal cancer are being expanded,72 and
new generations of screening tests based on high-risk HPV
are being developed to overcome the difficulty of maintain-
ing high-coverage, cytology-based cervical screening pro-
grams in low/middle-income countries.73
Because surgical treatment for stage I lung cancer has
demonstrated survival benefits,74 using low-dose computed
tomography75 to detect lung cancers earlier not only could
reduce the existing mortality but also could indirectly
improve the effectiveness of public health prevention and
tobacco-control campaigns.74 Because many hospitals in
China continue to use x-rays to detect lung cancer,74 build-
ing functional medical capacity, particularly in rural China,
remains a priority.
To address the geographic diversity and the inequitable
distribution of medical resources to urban areas (which con-
tain 30% of the population but receive 70% of the medical
resources), China has implemented the strategy of super-
centers for cancer care, which have extremely high concen-
trations of cancer surgical specialists with high caseloads.76
However, removing geographic and financial barriers to
access optimal treatment remains a priority, with rural and
disadvantaged people facing not only a relative shortage of
doctors but greater travel distances to access them. In addi-
tion, while basic medical insurance coverage is nearly uni-
versal,77,78 these schemes do not provide even partial
coverage for cancer treatments, meaning that patients are
either forced to pay out-of-pocket or go without.39,79
Any initiatives to improve the earlier detection and treat-
ment of cancer in China need to consider the unique tradi-
tions and cultural beliefs among the Chinese population.
There are widespread fatalistic attitudes toward cancer, a
reluctance to discuss treatment and prognosis for fear of
provoking unnecessary worry and poor outcomes, and a
perception that, regardless of any treatment, death is inevi-
table after a cancer diagnosis.39 Better understanding the
roles of these beliefs is critical to enable appropriate pro-
grams and interventions and to facilitate trusting relation-
ships between doctors and patients.39 In parallel to these
beliefs, traditional Chinese medicine has been embedded in
the Chinese health system for thousands of years and is
entwined with the culture, history, and politics of China.39
As such, there may be potential to integrate cancer care and
treatment with the role of clinical care through these exist-
ing traditional medical academic centers.
To better quantify the impact of early detection and
treatment on the observed trends in cancer incidence and
mortality, more detailed data on both the stage of disease at
presentation and the treatment received after diagnosis are
required.80,81 Given that these type of data are not currently
available in the Chinese cancer registry system, this will
require specific research studies with a sufficiently large,
representative, population-based cohort.
Limitations
Although the data presented in this study represent a dou-
bling of the population coverage compared with previous
estimates, they still only represent less than one-tenth of
the total Chinese population. There remains an unknown
level of uncertainty in these estimates. In addition, while
CA CANCER J CLIN 2016;66:115–132
VOLUME 66 _ NUMBER 2 _ MARCH/APRIL 2016
129
 quality-control efforts continue to improve the complete-
ness and validity of data within specific local cancer regis-
tries, as evidenced by the increasing number of Chinese
cancer registries being included in the CI5 series (from just 3
registries from mainland China in volume VII [1997], to 8
in volume VIII [2002], and then 12 in volume X [2014],82
and 23 used to estimate the national incidence burden in
GLOBOCAN for 2012),23 there remains some variability in
the quality of data, as evidenced by many registries not being
selected for inclusion in the last volume of the IARC CI5
series (ci5.iarc.fr; accessed June 10, 2015). The M/I ratio was
required as an approximation for 5-year relative survival.
The interpretation of the M/I ratio can be problematic,
because the mortality rate involves a different cohort of peo-
ple than the incidence rate.83 This makes it particularly sus-
ceptible to any changes in incidence over time, and so
provides a more accurate estimate of survival for those can-
cers with high case fatality. However, unpublished data from
the 17 Chinese cancer registries showed that the M/I ratio
for all cancers combined was only about 1.4% higher (in
absolute values) than the calculated 5-year relative survival
reported previously.27 Finally, in a country of 1.4 billion peo-
ple, there remain many challenges in ensuring that the inci-
dence and mortality numerator data represent the same
population at risk as the estimated resident population
denominator, particularly when considering cases treated in
major urban facilities and migrant workers from rural areas.
Geographic information of incident cases is based on the
place of permanent residence, not place of treatment. In
addition, cancers diagnosed among the sizable population of
migrant workers (9% of the population39) through the Urban
Resident Basic Medical Insurance program or the New Rural
Cooperative Medical Scheme, which cover the majority of
the Chinese population,77,78 both of which are based on their
place of household registration.
Conclusions
To develop an appropriately targeted national cancer con-
trol plan in China, it is critical to have a detailed assessment
of the cancer burden in China based on representative and
accurate, population-based data. These estimates and the
ongoing cancer registration efforts in China are important
steps supporting this aim. While there is still imprecision
associated with these national estimates, these estimates are
based on the best available data on cancer incidence and
mortality. They may serve as a baseline for future compari-
sons and further assessments to better understand the over-
all effectiveness of cancer control in China and provide
insights into the areas of greatest need for targeted support.
Internationally, there is a long history of governments and
other health providers having greater incentive to act when
there is clear, quantitative evidence demonstrating the
need. In this regard, these latest estimates demonstrate that
China faces huge challenges in managing the very large and
increasing burden of cancer now and in the future, requir-
ing a concerted effort and commitment from all levels of
government and nongovernment organizations.
Key areas may include the improvement of clinical cancer
care delivery at the population level, through targeted pol-
icy changes and investment in increasing access to health
service in rural areas and providing basic health care to the
disadvantaged populations. Primary prevention programs,
such as an effective tobacco-control policy and initiatives to
mitigate the negative influences of a more westernized life-
style, are crucial, along with efforts to increase the effective-
ness and coverage of the diagnostic techniques and
screening programs that are critical to reversing the cancer
epidemic in China. It remains a priority to ensure that the
existing air and water pollution-control legislation is
adequately implemented to ensure that real improvements
occur in practice. Given the importance of the contribution
of China to the worldwide burden of cancer, especially for
the 4 major cancers (cancers of the lung, liver, stomach, and
esophagus), strategies and policies to reduce these prevent-
able cancers (by reducing the prevalence of tobacco smok-
ing and the prevalence of infections associated with cancer
risk) will have a great impact on the future cancer burden
both in China and worldwide. �
