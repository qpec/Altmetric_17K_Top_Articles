SUMMARY
Advances in HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env)
design generate native-like trimers and high-resolu-
tion clade A, B, and G structures and elicit neutral-
izing antibodies. However, a high-resolution clade
C structure is critical, as this subtype accounts for
the majority of HIV infections worldwide, but well-
ordered clade C Env trimers are more challenging
to produce due to their instability. Based on
targeted glycine substitutions in the Env fusion
machinery, we defined a general approach that dis-
favors helical transitions leading to post-fusion con-
formations, thereby favoring the pre-fusion state.
We generated a stabilized, soluble clade C Env
(16055 NFL) and determined its crystal structure
at 3.9 A
˚ . Its overall conformation is similar to
SOSIP.664 and native Env trimers but includes a
covalent linker between gp120 and gp41, an engi-
neered 201-433 disulfide bond, and density corre-
sponding to 22 N-glycans. Env-structure-guided
design strategies resulted in multiple homogeneous
cross-clade immunogens with the potential to
advance HIV vaccine development.
INTRODUCTION
A fundamental obstacle faced by all enveloped viruses is how to
facilitate entry of their genetic material into susceptible host cells
across two lipid bilayers. Most enveloped viruses converge upon
a post-fusion ‘‘six-helix bundle’’ conformation of their envelope
glycoproteins (Env) to accomplish fusion of the viral and host
lipid bilayers, thereby facilitating entry of their genetic material
into susceptible target cells (reviewed in Colman and Lawrence
[2003]). Metastability is a requisite of envelope glycoproteins in
terms of folding and assembly of a structure that can rearrange
at the appropriate time to attain its fusion-active form. Extended
helical transitional intermediates are generated for viral fusion
proteins after receptor and co-receptor engagement, either at
the cell surface or at the lower pH of the endosome, propelling
the fusion peptide to the opposite end of the trimer for inser-
tion into the target cell membrane (reviewed in Eckert and Kim,
2001]). Subsequently, the transitional intermediate collapses
into a six-helix bundle, juxtaposing the viral and host cell mem-
branes, allowing formation of a fusion pore that enables entry
of the viral genetic material into the target cell.
For HIV, the Env is the sole neutralization target for antibodies
on the viral surface and thus is of major interest for vaccine
design. For decades, the generation of soluble mimics of Env
was challenging due to its inherent metastability, in part because
of the non-covalent association of the Env subunits, gp120 and
gp41, due to furin cleavage of the precursor gp160 during natural
infection to attain its fusion-active conformation (Berger et al.,
1991; Moore et al., 1990). An engineered disulfide linking the
two subunits and a key mutation, I559P, in heptad repeat 1
(HR1) resulted in the first native-like Env soluble mimic, the
SOSIP trimer (Binley et al., 2000; Sanders et al., 2002). However,
it was not until the generation of the subtype-A-derived BG505
SOSIP.664, with accompanying antigenicity, stability, and
high-resolution structural data, that these trimers became widely
considered and utilized as faithful mimics of the HIV spike (Julien
et al., 2013; Lyumkis et al., 2013; Sanders et al., 2013). SOSIP tri-
mers have been derived from many other Env sequences but can
result in mixtures of ordered and disordered oligomers that can
be ‘‘rescued’’ either by negative or positive selection (Guenaga
et al., 2015a; Julien et al., 2015; Pugach et al., 2015). The initial
cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) and crystal structures of
clade A BG505 SOSIP.664 (Julien et al., 2013; Lyumkis et al.,
2013; Pancera et al., 2014) have been followed by Env structures
for subtypes B and G (Lee et al., 2016; Stewart-Jones et al.,
2016). However, high-resolution clade-C-derived Env struc-
tures, the subtype that constitutes the vast majority of HIV infec-
tions worldwide, have not yet been obtained. In the past year, we
reported the engineering of an uncleaved soluble Env mimic, the
native, flexibly linked (NFL) trimer. This design includes the I559P

 mutation present in SOSIP trimers but uses an extended flexible
linker to replace the furin cleavage site between the two Env
subunits, rendering these trimers both covalently linked and
cleavage independent (Sharma et al., 2015). The native-like
NFL trimers display antigenic and biochemical characteristics
comparable to SOSIP trimers but do not require cleavage of
the two Env subunits by cellular or exogenous furins (Guenaga
et al., 2015b; Sharma et al., 2015). Like the SOSIP, the NFL
design works best on a subset of Env sequences and, in its orig-
inal design, is particularly inefficient at generating high yields of
trimers derived from clade C strains.
We engineered a soluble trimer based on an Indian subtype C
HIV Env sequence, called 16055 NFL ‘‘TD,’’ where TD refers to
the reversion of eight BG505-‘‘trimer-derived’’ residues that sub-
stantially improve the propensity to form native-like trimers (Gue-
naga et al., 2015b). To improve further on the TD design, we
introduced targeted glycine substitutions in gp41 at helix-to-
coil transitions to disfavor the post-fusion state of Env to
generate highly homogeneous, soluble NFL clade C trimers.
Aided by these design advances, we derived the crystal struc-
ture of the disulfide-stabilized (I201C-A433C) 16055 NFL TD
CC (T569G) trimer in complex with the broadly neutralizing anti-
bodies (bNAbs), PGT124 and 35O22, at 3.9 A
˚
resolution,
providing a high-resolution Env structure derived from a subtype
C primary isolate. Comparison of this new structure to the avail-
able subtype A, B, and G structures reveals overall similarities, as
well as interesting strain-dependent differences. In the NFL
trimer structure, electron density is present for at least one sugar
moiety of the 22 N-glycans visible from the 29 potential N-glyco-
sylation sites (PNGS) (n.b., the others are mainly in disordered
loops). The complex structure also defines the details of
PGT124 bNAb interactions with Env in the context of a well-or-
dered trimer. Aided by the structural analysis, additional trimer
redesign integrating TD, CC, glycine targeting, and further struc-
ture-based single-amino-acid modifications resulted in the gen-
eration of highly stable and homogeneous NFL soluble Env
mimics for multiple subtypes. These improved designs advance
our understanding of HIV Env structural interactions and our ca-
pacity to generate well-ordered NFL Env trimers from different
clinical isolates derived from multiple subtypes. These advances
lay a foundation for further structure-guided modifications to
improve trimer conformational homogeneity, stability, and yield,
providing an expanded repertoire of clade C and other HIV vac-
cine candidate immunogens. In a related accompanying paper,
the immunogenic properties of well-ordered 16055 NFL TD CC
trimers were evaluated in non-human primates (Martinez-Murillo
et al., 2017).
RESULTS
Glycine Substitutions in gp41 Promote Soluble Env
Trimer Formation
To generate clade C NFL Env glycoproteins amenable to crystal-
lization, we pursued a strategy to promote well-ordered trimer
formation. To disfavor the Env post-fusion state and conse-
quently promote pre-fusion trimer formation, we introduced
glycine substitutions into key coil-to-helix transitional areas of
the gp41 subunit, guided by the pre-fusion high-resolution Env
trimer structures (Figure 1A) (Garces et al., 2015; Gristick et al.,
2016; Julien et al., 2013; Lyumkis et al., 2013; Pancera et al.,
2014). Putative helical intermediates of Env are formed following
receptor-coreceptor engagement, liberating gp41 from gp120-
imposed conformational constraints. Because glycines disfavor
helix formation, we substituted G residues at selected coil-to-he-
lix junctions to inhibit conformational transitions to putative inter-
mediate and structurally defined post-fusion, helix-dominated
conformations. To test the glycine substitution strategy, we first
generated NFL trimeric proteins based on the transmitted/
founder subtype C South African HIV Env sequence, 1086c,
introducing TD substitutions previously described (Guenaga
et al., 2015b). TD stabilization alone was insufficient to generate
native-like trimers for 1086c as determined by both SEC and EM
(Figure 1B and Figure S1A), in contrast with their previous sub-
stantial impact on trimer formation for Indian clade C 16055
NFL and clade B JRFL NFL (Guenaga et al., 2015b).
To design more homogeneous 1086c NFL trimers and poten-
tially for a wide range of trimers from multiple strains, we identi-
fied inferred coil-to-helix transitional regions in gp41 guided by
the high-resolution structure of the pre-fusion BG505 SOSIP.664
and gp41 post-fusion structures (Buzon et al., 2010; Garces
et al., 2015; Gristick et al., 2016; Julien et al., 2013; Liu et al.,
2009; Lyumkis et al., 2013; Pancera et al., 2014). The pre-fusion
gp41 regions of interest were located in the N-terminal HR1 loop
(HR1N), which connects the central HR1 helix to the fusion pep-
tide proximal region (FPPR), and in the region proximal to the
N-glycan at residue 637 in HR2, where the HR2 helices bend
to wrap around the gp120 N and C termini (Figure 1A). Crystal
structures reveal that these coiled regions in gp41 transition to
helices during the pre-fusion to the post-fusion state (Buzon
et al., 2010; Shu et al., 2000; Tan et al., 1997). Therefore, within
the context of the 1086c NFL TD protein that displays no signif-
icant amount of ordered trimers, we generated selected glycine
substitutions to test their effect on ordered trimer formation.
Residues T536, L537, L544, L568, T569, N636, and Y638 were
individually substituted with glycines and evaluated by size
exclusion chromatography (SEC), EM, and immunoprecipitation
(IP). Following initial NFL glycoprotein purification by lectin-affin-
ity chromatography, SEC profiles revealed a marked change in
the proportions of monomeric, dimeric, and aggregated 1086c
glycoproteins carrying the selected glycine substitutions (Fig-
ure 1B). 1086c NFL TD glycoproteins with glycine substitutions
at positions 568 and 569 displayed the most improved trimer for-
mation relative to the TD variant, with reduced monomer, dimer,
and higher-order forms (Figure 1B). Substitutions at 544 and 636
showed moderate improvement, whereas substitutions at 536,
537, and 638 showed no improvement (Figure 1B).
EM negative-stain analysis of the trimeric proteins showed a
marked increase in native-like trimers for variants with glycine
substitutions at residues 568, 569, and 636 and moderately for
544, generally consistent with the SEC analysis (Figure S1A). IP
of NFL TD protein supernatants using the CD4 binding site
(CD4bs), trimer-preferring broadly neutralizing antibody (bNAb)
VRC03, and the trimer-independent CD4bs bNAb, VRC01,
yielded results consistent with the EM analysis. For example,
stronger intensity VRC03 IP bands were detected for NFL TD
variants with glycine substitutions at residues 568 and 569
compared to isogenic trimers lacking these changes (Fig-
ure S1B). We also evaluated various single-, double-, and
Immunity 46, 792–803, May 16, 2017

 triple-glycine combinations and concluded that single-L568G
or -T569G and double-L568G-N636G or -T569G-N636G substi-
tutions markedly improved the generation of well-ordered 1086c
NFL TD trimers. Based on the VRC03 IP band intensity,
triple combinations (T569G-L544G-N636G and L568G-L544G-
N636G) did not appear to be better than the double substitutions
and were not pursued further in this study (Figure S1B).
To assess the transferability of this strategy to other HIV Env se-
quences, we introduced the 1086c-effective T569G substitution
into the JRFL NFL TD and 16055 NFL TD glycoproteins (Guenaga
et al., 2015b) and assessed its effect on trimer homogeneity by
SEC and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The T569G sub-
stitution greatly increased trimer formation and homogeneity in
both clade B and C NFL TD contexts (Figures 1C, S1C, S2A,
and S2B). The L568G mutation conferred similar results in the
context of 16055 NFL TD as assessed by SEC and DSC, display-
ing comparable levels of homogeneity and stability (only 0.4�C
less) (Figure S1C). In fact, with no additional purification except
for isolation of the trimer fraction from the SEC, 98% of the

16055 NFL TD (T569G) trimers displayed
a native-like conformation as determined
by negative-stain EM (Figure 1C).
These results revealed that helix-dis-
rupting glycine substitutions at critical he-
lix-to-coil interfaces disfavor transitions
toward the receptor-triggered putative
HIV Env transitional intermediate and,
specifically, that glycine substitutions at
the HR1N residues 568 and 569 and
HR2 residue 636 increased native-like
Env trimer formation.
The Clade C Cleavage-Independent
16055 NFL TD CC T569G Trimer
Shares Structural Homology with
Clade A, B, and G Envs
Several HIV-1 subtype C Env-derived
SOSIP and NFL trimers are well des-
cribed biochemically and by low-resolution EM (Guenaga
et al., 2015a, 2015b; Julien et al., 2015; Ringe et al., 2015;
Sharma et al., 2015). However, no high-resolution structure of
a soluble subtype C Env trimer has been determined. We there-
fore used the highly homogeneous T569G variant of 16055 NFL
TD CC trimer to generate crystals that diffracted to 3.9 A
˚ in com-
plex with bNAbs PGT124 and 35O22 (Garces et al., 2014; Huang
et al., 2014; Pancera et al., 2014). From this ternary complex, we
were able to determine the crystal structure of a clade C Env NFL
trimer by molecular replacement (see STAR Methods, Figure 2A,
and Table 1).
Overall, the structure of 16055 NFL TD CC (T569G) in complex
with PGT124 and 35O22 closely resembles those of soluble sub-
type A BG505 SOSIP.664, subtype G X1193.c1 SOSIP.664, and
full-length native subtype B JRFL Env DCT Env trimers (Fig-
ure 2B) (Garces et al., 2015; Julien et al., 2013; Lee et al.,
2016; Pancera et al., 2014; Stewart-Jones et al., 2016). The sim-
ilarity strengthens the interpretation that the engineered soluble
NFL trimers, like SOSIP, are close mimics of HIV Env. The largest
794

 differences among Env structures were localized to variable re-
gions V1, V2, V4, and V5 of gp120 and the HR1N region spanning
residues 545–569 of gp41 (Figure S2C). With the exception of the
V3, variable regions of gp120 differ both in length and conforma-
tion and contribute to antigenic variation with respect to antibody
recognition (Figure S2C). The observed HR1N differences may
be relevant to trimer stability and, perhaps, to the capacity of
different Env sequences to form stable, soluble trimers, since
the well-documented I559P substitution (Sanders et al., 2002)
and the T569G described here are located in this flexible region,
and both affect trimerization propensity (Figure S2C). Another
difference in these NFL trimers is the flexible (G4S)2 linker con-
necting gp120 to gp41 that eliminates the need for furin cleavage
(Sharma et al., 2015), for which only the first three glycine resi-
dues are visible in the NFL structure (Figure 2A).
Structural alignment between the BG505 SOSIP.664 and the
16055 NFL TD CC (T569G) structures revealed low Ca RMSD
values for the gp140 protomer (0.7 A
˚ ) and the respective
gp120 (0.6 A

idues 553–565 of the gp41 HR1N were not
resolved in the 16055 structure, L566,
Q567, L568, and G569 downstream of
the I559P substitution were interpretable
and offer some insights into how the
569 glycine substitution contributed to
the generation of stable clade C Env
NFL trimers (Figure 2B). The orientation
and location of these four residues (566–
569) in 16055 NFL TD CC (T569G) deviate
from that in the BG505 SOSIP.664 and
X1193.c1 SOSIP structures (PDB: 5CEZ
and PDB: 5FYJ) but follow an initial path
more similar to that in the clade B JRFL
Env DCT (PDB: 5FUU), although different
in conformation (Figures 2B and S2C).
The
helix-disrupting
capacity
of
the
T569G mutation disfavors the extension
of the HR1C helix, helping HR1N remain in its flexible coil form
observed in the SOSIP structures (Figures 2B and S2C). The in-
crease in NFL trimer formation may also result from generation of
new local stabilizing contacts in the HR1N region; however, no in-
crease in the overall trimer thermal transition midpoint (Tm) was
detected (Figure S2A). Perhaps the glycine substitution simply
decreases the tendency of this region to adopt a transitional in-
termediate form of gp41, therefore favoring the pre-fusion state.
These analyses demonstrated that the crystal structure of the
furin-independent clade C Env 16055 NFL TD CC (T569G) shares
overall structural homology with other Envs, revealing differ-
ences in the surface-exposed variable regions and in the more
occluded trimer-axis proximal region of gp41 HR1N.
Env N-Glycosylation Differences between Strains
Identify Potential Sites of Vulnerability for Antibody
Recognition
HIV has evolved immune evasion mechanisms that pose a ma-
jor challenge to vaccine design. Env surface N-glycosylation is
Immunity 46, 792–803, May 16, 2017
795
 an
important
evasion
mechanism
in
which
self-glycans
occlude the underlying Env protein surface. With an average
of 80–90 N-linked glycans per Env trimer, this protective
coverage is often referred to as the ‘‘glycan shield’’ (Lasky
et al., 1986; Wei et al., 2003). The 16055 NFL TD CC trimers
were produced in a GnTI�/� mutant cell line that results in pro-
cessing of N-glycans to Man5–9GlcNAc2 oligomannose forms.
The ternary complex of PGT124:16055 NFL TD CC:35O22
was deglycosylated by Endoglycosidase H (Endo H) treatment
to facilitate crystallization. At least one sugar moiety for 22 gly-
cans was visible in the electron density maps out of the 29 po-
tential N-linked glycosylation sites (PNGS) in the 16055 Env
sequence. For 15 N-glycans out of the 22 visible in the struc-
ture, we observed density beyond the peptide-proximal N-ace-
tylglucosamine moiety, indicating protection from Endo H
cleavage. The other glycan positions for which we did not
observe interpretable density were mainly in disordered re-
gions or loops. In comparison, 17 glycans had observable
electron density in the 27 PNGS of the 3A
˚
structure of
BG505 SOSIP.664 (Figure 3) (Garces et al., 2015). The V1
and C2 regions of 16055 were more heavily glycosylated, pos-
sessing five additional PNGSs at N138, N147, N230, N241, and
N289. In contrast, the C3 region of BG505 had two additional
potential glycosylation sites at N339 and N355 (Figure 3).
Breaches in the glycan shield, such as those corresponding
to N230-N241-N289 and N339-N355 for BG505 and 16055,
respectively, may define strain-specific sites of vulnerability
as recently shown for Env vaccine-elicited antibodies in rabbits
(Crooks et al., 2015; Klasse et al., 2016; McCoy et al., 2016).
Some of these rabbit antibodies neutralize the HIV BG505
strain by exploiting a gap in the glycan shield at the N241 re-
gion, thereby more readily accessing the exposed protein sur-
face. However, the majority of HIV strains are glycosylated at
N241, as is 16055, or possess a different protein sequence in
this region, making them resistant to neutralization by such an-
tibodies (Figure 4A).
Almost all bNAbs isolated from infected patients, such as
PGT124 that targets the 332 N-glycan and V3 base, incorporate
glycans as part of their epitope, contacting a combination of
sugar moieties and underlying protein residues (Figure 4B). In
the 16055 crystal structure, PGT124 penetrates into a cleft sur-
rounded by glycans N156, N301, and N332 (Figure 4B). The
antibody mostly avoids the N-glycans at residues N156 and
N301 but makes contact with N332 and the conserved V3
324G(N/D)IR327 motif as previously demonstrated for PGT124
in the context of a gp120 core (Garces et al., 2014). The NFL
trimer structure shows additional van der Waals interactions be-
tween PGT124 CDRL3 (Ser93, Ser95), CDRH3 (Phe100k), and
gp120 V1 (Thr137) and backbone contacts between CDRL3
(Arg94) and the base of gp120 V3 (Ile322) (Figure 4B).
Phe100g at the tip of CDRH3 that is important for the neutraliza-
tion activity of PGT124 in a paratope scan (Garces et al., 2014)
interacts with Env Gln328, Tyr330, Thr415, and Pro417
(Figure 4B).
These data were consistent with the limited neutralizing ca-
pacity of strain-specific antibodies that exploit gaps in the HIV
Env N-glycan shield, while bNAbs evolve to accommodate
glycan recognition as a means to more consistently penetrate
the shield.

 The High-Resolution 16055 NFL Structure Reveals the
Stabilizing Effects of the TD and CC Substitutions
The 16055 NFL trimer contains eight engineered TD residues, the
CC disulfide, and the T569G glycine substitution. The NFL struc-
ture elucidated the role of these design elements in generating
native-like trimers with increased stability (Guenaga et al.,
2015b). We observed interactions for six of the eight TD residues
located in four distinct areas of Env: gp120-gp41 interface
(Arg500), gp120 N terminus (Asp47 and Glu49), pre-bridging
sheet (Arg429 and Gln432), and apex domain (Leu165) (Fig-
ure S3B). The Arg500 substitution at the C terminus of gp120
contacts the adjacent gp41 His619 and gp120 N-terminal resi-
dues Gly32 and Leu34, strengthening the association of gp120
with gp41 at the base of the trimer. Asp47 and Glu49 in the N-ter-
minal region of gp120 contact Lys487 and Asp99, respectively,
anchoring this flexible region. Leu165 at the tip of the trimer V2

adjacent protomer, presumably strength-
ening apical trimer interactions. Arg429
and Gln432 contact Asn425, Thr202,
and Leu116, creating a network of inter-
actions that may stabilize the pre-bridging
sheet (Figure S3B). TD Lys65 and Thr106
do not contribute to any obvious produc-
tive interactions.
The 16055 NFL TD CC (T569G) crystal
structure
illustrates
formation
of
the
I201C-A433C disulfide (CC) that was en-
gineered to prevent CD4-induced trimer
rearrangements and subsequent expo-
sure of non-neutralizing epitopes (Fig-
ure 5A) (Guenaga et al., 2015b; Kwon
et al., 2015). As the 16055 NFL TD CC
(T569G) and BG505 SOSIP.664 trimer
structures displayed similar conforma-
tions, with a Ca RSMD of 0.6 A
˚ for gp120
(Figure S3A), the engineered CC does
not
appear
to
significantly
alter
the
conformation of the pre-CD4 form of
the CD4bs. This region constitutes a
conserved neutralizing determinant, so
maintenance of an unperturbed CD4bs is an important consider-
ation for HIV vaccine design. Relevant to this latter point, affinity
and avidity measurements for bNAb Fabs VRC01 and VRC06b to
NFL TD trimers with and without the CC disulfide were of similar
magnitude (Figure S4). For sCD4, although the overall KD values
were the same, CD4 had a slightly faster on rate but faster off rate
with the NFL TD CC trimers.
Comparison of the gp120 subunit of the 16055 NFL TD CC
(T569G) trimer structure with the CD4-liganded gp120 core
(PDB: 3JWO) (Pancera et al., 2010) revealed differences be-
tween these two gp120 conformations, as previously described
(Pancera et al., 2014) (Figures 5B and 5C). This comparison sug-
gested a receptor-triggered model, whereby gp120 conforma-
tional changes culminate in the release of restraints on gp41.
In this model, CD4 interaction with gp120 induces a displace-
ment of the b20 and b21 loop, triggering Env rearrangements
Immunity 46, 792–803, May 16, 2017
797
 that lead to co-receptor engagement. Serine 42 of CD4 would
‘‘push’’ gp120 glutamine 428 (b20), facilitating release of b21
contacts with b3 (Figure 5B). The subsequent swap of b3 and
b2 facilitates rearrangement of the variable domains (V1/V2),
liberating the V3 region to engage with the co-receptor. However,
the engineered CC disulfide specifically prevents dissociation of
b21 from b3, acting as a molecular tether that locks gp120 into its
pre-receptor conformation (Figure 5A). Other structural differ-
ences were observed that connect the CD4-bound trigger point
(b20-b21) with release of gp41 HR1 from gp120. Helix a-1 in
the CD4-liganded core was tilted a few degrees toward the adja-
cent a-0 (Figure 5C), suggesting that CD4 receptor and subse-
quent CCR5 coreceptor binding trigger a chain of events that
lead to the formation of a putative intermediate Env structure.
In sum, these analyses demonstrated that the TD, CC, and
T569G mutations combine to preserve the pre-fusion state of
the NFL trimers by disfavoring conformational changes in gp120
and gp41 that otherwise would favor the fusion-active form.

lowing receptor-coreceptor engagement
on target cells (Figure 6A) (Buzon et al.,
2010; Luftig et al., 2006; Pancera et al.,
2014). We sought to further stabilize the
soluble NFL trimers beyond the stabiliz-
ing mutations described in the structure
presented here by further reducing the inherent Env metasta-
bility. We reasoned that conformational stabilization of these
trimeric immunogens might be important for preservation and
presentation of quaternary-dependent neutralizing epitopes
following vaccination and affinity maturation while avoiding Env
states that expose non-neutralizing epitopes.
We selected JRFL NFL TD CC (T569G) as a test case because
of its inherent lower thermostability in comparison with BG505
or 16055 native-like trimers (Guenaga et al., 2015a, 2015b;
Sharma et al., 2015). Following a structure-guided approach,
a number of V3 or FP residues were scanned for their capacity
to increase inter- or intra-protomer interactions. We made sub-
stitutions of selected residues in these regions to large side
chains—mainly, Trp, Tyr, and Arg—to fill pockets or make
potential additional contacts to enhance subunit and trimer in-
teractions. The initial scan identified three V3-FP stabilizing mu-
tations (V3 N302Y and FP F519R and L520R) that resulted in
increased trimer melting temperatures. DSC analysis of the tri-
ple mutant (N302Y F519R L520R) JRFL NFL TD CC (T569G)
confirmed a 6�C increase in the Tm (Figure 6B). We introduced
the V3-FP mutations into subtype A BG505 NFL CC and sub-
type C 16055 NFL TD CC (T569G) and determined that their
respective Tm’s also increased by 6�C (Figure 6B). By applying
all elements of the current design strategy (TD, CC, gp41

 glycines, and V3-FP mutations, herein called NFL TD CC+) to
other HIV Env sequences from clades B (SC422 and WITO)
and C (1086c, 001428 and ZM197M), we sought to demonstrate
the general applicability of our soluble NFL TD CC+ trimer plat-
form (Figure S5). The NFL TD CC+ design made use of double
glycine substitutions, either G568-G636 or G569-G636, as
needed to increase homogeneity of the highly stabilized trimers.
The resulting NFL TD CC+ trimers were purified via lectin affinity
followed by SEC and then subjected to DSC analysis to assess
their overall stability and homogeneity. SEC profiles revealed
prominent trimer peaks at the expected elution volume (Fig-
ure 6C), resulting in final yields of well-ordered trimers ranging
from 2–4.5 mgs per liter of transfected 293F cells (Figure S5).
Trimer stability, measured by DSC and reported as the Tm,
ranged from 66�C to 77�C, displaying single narrow symmetric
thermal transition curves that are characteristic of a homoge-
neous molecular species (Figure S6). Recognition of trimer-
preferring V2-apex bNAbs (PGT145, PGDM1400, PG16, and

gested that these soluble trimers adop-
ted native-like conformations. Binding
affinities for these ligands were deter-
mined by BLI and ranged from 2 to
205 nM (Figure 6D and Table S1). Gener-
ally, higher affinities (< 100nM) for NFL
TD CC+ trimers were associated with
neutralization of the matched parental
HIV strain by that same bNAb, while
lower binding affinities (> 100nM) were
associated
with
an
inability
of
that
bNAb to neutralize the parental isolate from which the NFL
was derived (Table S1).
These results indicated that combining the HIV Env stabilizing
elements (TD, CC, glycines, and the V3-FP mutations) facilitated
the high-yield production of cross-clade stable soluble NFL tri-
mers that were efficiently recognized by trimer-specific bNAbs.
DISCUSSION
Here, we described the design strategy and high-resolution
crystal structure of a stabilized, soluble, subtype C HIV-1 Env
trimer, 16055 NFL TD CC (T569G). The NFL protomer structure
was virtually identical to that of subtype A BG505 SOSIP.664
and subtype G X1193.c1 SOSIP.664 soluble trimers and to sub-
type B native JRFL Env DCT, despite Env amino-acid-sequence
variability in different subtypes and despite the fact that the NFL
Env subunits, gp120 and gp41, are covalently linked by a flex-
ible peptide linker. The structural differences were limited to
the variable apex regions V1, V2, V4, and V5 in gp120, HR1N

 in gp41, and the glycan shield. Viral evolution, driven by immune
selection pressure and accommodated by the error-prone
reverse
transcriptase,
generates
sequence
diversity
while
conserving the key functional regions (receptor binding, fusion)
that permit viral entry. Type I fusion proteins, such as the HIV-1
Env, mediate transfer of viral genetic material across the virus
and host cell membranes to initiate replication. To carry out
this vital function, fusion proteins adopt a highly metastable
conformation in their pre-fusion state. Upon binding of receptor
(and co-receptor), and sometimes exposure to low pH in endo-
somal compartments (e.g., influenza virus), large-scale Env
conformational rearrangements are triggered, leading initially
to extension of the long central helix (HR1C) that propels the
fusion peptide toward and into the target cell. This state sub-
sequently collapses to the post-fusion six-helix bundle, medi-
ating viral-to-cell-membrane fusion. We made helix-disrupting
glycine substitutions in strategically located gp41 residues
that would disfavor such transitions. We selected junctional
sites that transition from coils to helices in the post-fusion
conformation to disrupt their helical potential. In doing so, we
presumably decreased Env-free energy required to transition
to the fusion intermediate, thereby favoring instead the pre-
fusion state. The targeted T569G mutation was instrumental in
improving the homogeneity of the soluble 16055 NFL TD CC
trimer, perhaps by decreasing the propensity of gp41 to
‘‘spring’’ to undesired post-fusion conformations. The modified
16055 NFL generated diffraction-quality crystals that enabled
structure determination.
The protein engineering in this study was tailored to generate
soluble mimics of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein—in this
case, the NFL trimer—but likely will work in the SOSIP platform,
as we showed for the TD CC design elements (Guenaga et al.,
2015b). The combination of stabilizing elements (TD, CC, and
V3-FP mutations) and glycine substitutions allowed us to
generate stable and homogeneous soluble mimics of Env
derived from diverse HIV strains that can be used for both
candidate immunogens and for structural studies. More impor-
tantly, the glycine modifications and other elements involved in
the stabilization could be applied to other viral fusion proteins
that undergo large conformational changes in transitioning
from a pre-fusion to a post-fusion state. Another recent suc-
cessful strategy has been to truncate the N-terminal HR1 region
by substitution of a shorter connecting region that increases its
stability and expression (Kong et al., 2016). In contrast, our
strategy here focused on retaining the length of the N-terminal
HR1 region and applying targeted glycine substitutions to
inhibit helix extension and the subsequent ‘‘spring-loaded’’
gp41 rearrangement of its individual helices in HR1 and HR2
to a more stable six-bundle helical structure for fusion.
Targeted substitution of helix-disrupting glycines disfavors
formation of intermediate, receptor-activated forms of the viral
envelope protein, increasing native-like trimer yields and homo-
geneity. The well-ordered 16055 NFL clade C trimers described
here were evaluated as immunogens following vaccination of
NHPs, as reported in an accompanying manuscript. This study
found that the 16055 NFL TD CC trimers, when arrayed at high-
density on liposomes, induced autologous tier 2 neutralizing
antibodies, targeting the Env V2 apical region (Martinez-Murillo
et al., 2017).

METHOD DETAILS
Design of NFL TD CC+ trimer constructs
HIV Env sequences (BG505, JRFL, SC422, WITO, 16055, 001428, ZM197M and 1086c (accession numbers DQ208458, U63632,
AY835441, AY835451, EF117268, EF117266, DQ388515 and FJ444395, respectively) were modified to generate NFL TD CC+ sol-
uble gp140 trimers as follows. The furin cleavage motif at the C terminus of gp120, ‘‘REKR,’’ was genetically deleted and replaced
with two copies of the G4S (GGGGS) flexible linker, which covalently joins the C terminus of gp120 to the N terminus of gp41(Sharma
et al., 2015). A proline substitution at residue 559 was introduced by genetic means to facilitate trimer formation (Sanders et al., 2002).
The gp140 sequences were genetically terminated at D664 (Klasse et al., 2013) followed by a G4S linker, His6 tag, and stop codon.
The 16055 NFL protein construct used for the crystallization study had a stop codon after residue D664. All Env sequences except
BG505 were modified with TD (BG505-trimer derived) residues and selected gp41 glycine substitutions to generate more stable and
homogeneous NFL TD trimers (see Figure S5 for specific substitutions)(Guenaga et al., 2015b). Finally, all NFL TD+ constructs,
including BG505, were genetically engineered with a C201-C433 disulfide (Guenaga et al., 2015b; Kwon et al., 2015) and V3-FP sta-
bilizing mutations (Y302, R519 and R520). Substitutions in the Env-derived NFL glycoproteins were introduced via site-directed
mutagenesis PCR using a QuikChange Lightning Multi Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies) into expression plasmid
DNAs. Substitutions were confirmed by sequencing (Genewiz).
Expression and purification of soluble proteins
Expression plasmids (CMV-R) encoding the NFL trimeric Env-derived glycoproteins were transfected in FreeStyle 293F or 293S cells
using 293fectin (Invitrogen). Cell culture supernatants were harvested five days post transfection and the Env-derived proteins pu-
rified by lectin affinity chromatography (Galanthus nivalis, Vector Labs) followed by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) on a Super-
dex 200 16/60 or Superdex 200 10/300 GL (GE Healthcare). Similarly, all Fabs were produced by transient transfection in FreeStyle
293F and purified by affinity chromatography on a CaptureSelect LC-lambda column (ThermoFisher Scientific), followed by cation
exchange chromatography and SEC on a Superdex 200 16/60.
Sample preparation for crystallization
Crystallization screening required the testing of many combinations of ligand-16055 NFL TD CC (T569G) trimer complexes in different
conditions. Generally, trimers and antibody ligands were mixed in a 1:3.2 molar ratio before SEC purification of the complex. To
decrease heterogeneity on the NFL trimer:ligand complexes, NFL trimer produced in 293S cells was complexed with antibodies
and then deglycosylated using Endoglycosidase H (EndoH; New England Biolabs) in 200 mM NaCl, 50 mM sodium citrate pH 5.5
for 45 min at 37�C (Julien et al., 2013). Glycans interacting with or protected by interaction with the Fabs are generally preserved
in their ‘native’ forms (in this case high mannose due to the cell line used for expression), but those accessible to EndoH are trimmed
to the core GlcNAc moiety.
Crystallization and data collection
To determine the molecular architecture of the 16055 NFL TD CC (T569G) Env trimer, we analyzed the soluble NFL trimer in a ternary
complex with Fabs PGT124 and 35O22. These Fabs maintain the native trimer conformation and facilitate crystal packing (Garces
et al., 2015). The purified ternary complex was concentrated to �12.2 mg/ml and screened in nearly 1000 crystallization conditions at
4 and 20�C using the IAVI/JCSG/TSRI CrystalMation robot (Rigaku) system at TSRI (Elsliger et al., 2010). Initial crystals were found in
0.2 M ammonium sulfate pH 4.5, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 20% (v/v) PEG 300 and 0.1 M phosphate-citrate pH 4.2. Optimized crystals were
grown in 0.2 M ammonium sulfate, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 22% (v/v) PEG 300 and 0.1 M phosphate-citrate pH 4.03 and did not require

 further cryoprotection (as the 10% glycerol in the crystallization condition was sufficient). The crystals were then stored by immediate
flash cooling in liquid nitrogen. Data were collected at APS beamline 23-ID-D. Although we observed some diffraction to 3.5 A
˚ , the
final dataset was processed with HKL-2000 (Otwinowski and Minor, 1997) to 3.9 A
˚ with an overall Rsym of 0.23% and 100% complete-
ness in space group P63 with unit cell parameters: a = b = 126.5 A
˚ , c = 314.1 A
˚ (Table 1).
Structure determination and refinement
For the ternary complex, two previous structures were used for phasing by MR: a protomer of 35O22:BG505 SOSIP.664 (PDB: 5CEZ)
and the high-resolution unliganded PGT124 Fab (PDB: 4R26). Model building was carried out using Coot (Emsley and Cowtan, 2004)
and refinement with phenix.refine using reference model restraints calculated from the structure of 35O22:BG505 SOSIP.664 (PDB:
5CEZ) and the PGT124 Fab (PDB: 4R26) (Adams et al., 2010). The final Rcryst and Rfree values are 27.4% and 31.8% (Table 1). For the
Fabs, residues were numbered according to Kabat (Martin, 1996), and gp120/gp41 numbered following the HXBc2 system (Ratner
et al., 1987).
Differential scanning calorimetry
The thermal transition points (Tm) of the NFL trimeric proteins were determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) using a
MicroCal VP-Capillary DSC instrument (Malvern). Prior to the DSC melting scan, the protein samples were extensively dialyzed in
PBS, pH 7.4, and the concentrations were adjusted to 0.25 mg/ml. The dialysis buffer was used as the reference solution. The
DSC experiments were done at a scanning rate of 1 K/min under 3.0 atmospheres of pressure. DSC data were analyzed after buffer
correction, normalization, and baseline subtraction using MicroCal VP-Capillary DSC analysis software provided by the
manufacturer.
Bio-Layer interferometry binding analysis
All binding measurements were carried out on an Octet Red instrument (ForteBio) with IgGs immobilized on anti-human IgG Fc cap-
ture sensors (ForteBio). The NFL trimers were assessed as free analytes in solution (PBS pH 7.4). For measurement of the V2-Apex
bNAbs kinetic parameters, the analytes (NFL trimers) were concentrated to 800nM and then serially diluted 1:2 to a final concentra-
tion of 12.5nM. Association and dissociation times were 2 and 4 min respectively. Data were analyzed using the ForteBio analysis
software version 7.1 (ForteBio) and the kinetic parameters were calculated using a global fit 1:1 model.
Electron microscopy and data collection
Following lectin purification, the NFL TD proteins were analyzed by negative-stain EM. A 3 mL aliquot containing �0.03 mg/mL of the
sample was applied for 15 s onto a carbon-coated 400 Cu mesh grid that had been glow discharged at 15 mA for 30 s, then negatively
stained with 2% uranyl formate for 50 s. Data were collected using a FEI Tecnai Spirit electron microscope operating at 120 kV, with
an electron dose of �30 e-/A
˚ 2 and a magnification of 52,000 x that resulted in a pixel size of 2.05 A
˚ at the specimen plane. Images
were acquired with a Tietz 4k 3 4k TemCam-F416 CMOS camera using a nominal defocus of 1000 nm and the Leginon package
(Suloway et al., 2005).
Electron microscopy data processing
Particles were picked automatically using DoG Picker and put into a particle stack using the Appion software package (Lander et al.,
2009; Voss et al., 2009). Reference-free, two-dimensional (2D) class averages were calculated using particles binned by two via the
iterative msa/mra Clustering 2D Alignment and IMAGIC software systems and sorted into classes (Sorzano et al., 2010; van Heel
et al., 1996). To analyze the quality of the trimers (closed, partially open, or non-native like trimers), reference-free 2D class averages
were examined by visual inspection using the same metrics as previously described (Pugach et al., 2015).
Immunoprecipitation
Supernatants containing overexpressed NFL proteins were subjected to immunoprecipitation analysis to determine the relative
amount of native-like trimers within the mixture. Briefly, 20 mL of rProtein A Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) were added to an
Eppendorf tube, washed twice with PBS, and resuspended in 500 mL of PBS. Selected antibodies were added to the tubes containing
the agarose beads (5ug per antibody in separate tubes). The mixture was rocked for 30 min at 4�C and then washed twice with
500mM NaCl PBS to removed unbound antibody. Supernatants were aspirated without disturbing the beads and 1 mL of NFL protein
containing filtered supernatant was added to each tube. After one-hour incubation at RT, the tubes were centrifuged at 1000 g for
5 min and the supernatant containing unbound protein was discarded. The protein A-agarose pellets containing the bound anti-
body-Env complexes were washed twice with 1 mL of PBS and then resuspended in 20 mL of SDS-PAGE loading buffer. The protein
complexes were resolved over an SDS-PAGE 4%–12% Bis Tris NuPAGE gel (Invitrogen) for 50 min at 200 V.
