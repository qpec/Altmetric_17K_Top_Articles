Abstract
Objective—To evaluate whether women planning a pregnancy are less likely to use alcohol in 
early pregnancy than those with unintended pregnancies.
Methods—Right From the Start (2000–2012) is a prospective, community-based pregnancy 
cohort. Maternal demographic, reproductive, and behavioral data were collected in telephone 
interviews at enrollment (mean ± SD: 48 ± 13 days of gestation) and later in the first trimester 
(mean ± SD: 85 ± 21 days). Alcohol consumption characteristics were included in the interviews. 
We used logistic regression to investigate the association of pregnancy intention with alcohol use.
Results—Among 5,036 women, 55% reported using alcohol in the first trimester, with 6% 
continuing use at the first trimester interview. Pregnancy was planned by 70% of participants. 
Alcohol use occurred in 55% and 56% of intended and unintended pregnancies, respectively 
(p=0.32). Adjusting for confounders, women with intended pregnancies were 31% less likely to 
consume any alcohol in early pregnancy (adjusted OR (aOR): 0.69, 95% CI: 0.60–0.81) or binge 
drink (aOR: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.54–0.86). Most women, regardless of intention, stopped or decreased 
alcohol consumption in early pregnancy.
Conclusion—The majority of women, irrespective of intention, stopped or decreased drinking 
after pregnancy recognition. This suggests promoting early pregnancy awareness could prove more 
effective than promoting abstinence from alcohol among all who could conceive.

 INTRODUCTION
Since alcohol exposure can have devastating effects on the fetus, the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention (CDC) recently embarked upon a public health education effort with 
the primary aim of decreasing alcohol exposure in pregnancy[1]. Noting that 53% of US 
women in a large CDC study consumed alcohol within the previous 30 days and over half of 
pregnancies in the U.S. are unplanned[2, 3], the CDC recommends that all women who are 
planning a pregnancy or not using reliable contraception abstain from alcohol use[2, 3]. In 
response, women, the media, policy pundits, international health commentators, and care 
providers criticized the program as patronizing social engineering and asked pointed 
questions regarding the primacy of improved contraceptive access and lack of normative 
data about typical behavior [4, 5]. The guidance implies that women desiring a pregnancy 
will abstain from alcohol, but previous studies provide conflicting evidence on the effect 
pregnancy intention has on alcohol consumption[6, 7]. Despite being the focus of several 
large studies, consistent predictors of alcohol exposure in pregnancy have yet to be 
determined[8, 9]. Research also provides conflicting findings of which maternal 
characteristics are predictors of risky drinking behaviors in pregnancy, such as binge 
drinking, defined as consumption of five or more drinks on one occasion[9, 10].
Our objective was to examine the independent association of pregnancy intention with 
maternal alcohol consumption from the periconception period (30 days prior to missed 
menses) through the first trimester of pregnancy. Additionally, we sought to describe 
maternal characteristics associated with continued use of alcohol in pregnancy and binge 
drinking.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Right from the Start (RFTS) is a prospective, community-based cohort study of women 
enrolled between 2000 and 2012 prior to 12 weeks of gestation. Participants were recruited 
from multiple metropolitan areas in North Carolina, Texas, and Tennessee. To be eligible for 
the cohort, a woman must be over the age of 18, speak English or Spanish, and not use 
assisted reproductive technology. Specific details about participant recruitment have been 
published previously[11]. RFTS consisted of three phases with multiple sources of funding 
and a wide range of aims. All phases share common methods and data elements.
A telephone enrollment interview captured baseline demographic and previous pregnancy 
information and was administered at a mean of 48 days ± 13 days of gestation. An extensive 
first trimester computer assisted telephone interview (CATI) was conducted near the end of 
the trimester (mean ± SD: 85 days ± 21 days). This interview assessed medical history, prior 
reproductive history, symptoms and events during the current pregnancy, health behaviors 
(caffeine, tobacco, illicit drug, and alcohol use), medication and supplement use, and 
physical activity. Participants had an early first trimester ultrasound to confirm gestational 
dating (mean gestational age at ultrasound, 9 weeks). Of the 6,288 pregnancies enrolled in 
RFTS, 5,036 were eligible for inclusion in this analysis (Figure 1). The institutional review 
board of Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee approved this 
study.

 Participants voluntarily provided information about alcohol consumption prior to and during 
pregnancy in the first trimester interview. Information regarding pattern of use, frequency, 
quantity, and type of alcohol were also obtained. Women with a history of alcohol use within 
the four months prior to the interview were considered exposed. Information was also 
obtained on frequency of binge drinking, defined as consuming five or more drinks on any 
single occasion. For the purpose of the study, an alcoholic drink was defined as 14 grams of 
ethanol[12]. Some women reported alcohol use in the periconception and early pregnancy 
period but did not provide information on specific characteristics such as quantity or 
frequency (n=458). These women were considered exposed and included in the primary 
analyses, but were excluded from the secondary analyses that required more specific 
measures of exposure.
Pregnancy intention was assessed by maternal interview at enrollment, using the 
intendedness of pregnancy items developed by the CDC[13]. A pregnancy was considered 
intended if the participant affirmed that she desired to have a baby, or another baby, at some 
time in her life and became pregnant in what she deemed was “about the right time” or later 
than desired. Pregnancies considered sooner than desired or not desired entirely were 
classified as unintended.
Maternal demographic, reproductive, and behavioral data were collected in telephone 
interviews at enrollment and in the first trimester. Covariates, determined a priori based on 
literature review and biologic plausibility consisted of maternal education level (high school/
less, some college, college graduate/more), maternal age, race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic 
white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, other), marital status (married, other), first trimester 
BMI, maternal prenatal vitamin use, history of spontaneous and therapeutic abortion, 
household income, smoking status, and illicit drug use (use of any illegal substance in the 
past 4 months) were also obtained to assess association between these variables and alcohol 
consumption during pregnancy.
We tested for bivariate differences in maternal characteristics between women with intended 
and unintended pregnancies using the chi-squared test. Mean and median alcohol 
consumption were calculated as the average number of drinks per week from the 
periconception period through the first trimester interview. If the study participant reported a 
change in pattern of alcohol consumption during this time, mean and median consumption 
was calculated for before and after the change taking into account gestational week in which 
change in consumption was reported, Chi-squared tests were used to examine patterns of use 
by intendedness. We used univariate and multivariable logistic regression models to 
investigate the independent association of pregnancy intention with alcohol use in early 
pregnancy. All covariates determined a priori were included in the final logistic regression 
model. Interaction terms were generated for pregnancy intention and maternal age at 
enrollment, history of spontaneous/therapeutic abortions, parity, and maternal education to 
test for effect modification. No effect modification was noted (p>0.20). Univariate and 
multivariable analyses were also generated for the given maternal demographic/reproductive 
characteristics to determine association with alcohol consumption in pregnancy. All analyses 
were conducted in R-software version 3.1.2 (www.r-project.org) or Stata version 14.0 
(StataCorp, College Station, TX).

 RESULTS
The final cohort population consisted of 5,036 women. Among them, 70% were reported the 
pregnancy was intended. Intended pregnancies were more common among women who 
were older (p<0.001), white (p<0.001), college educated or greater (p<0.001), married 
(p<0.001), and of higher income (p<0.001), (Table 1).
Fifty-five percent of women in the study reported using alcohol in the 12 weeks preceding 
the first trimester interview with use occurring in 55% and 56% of intended and unintended 
pregnancies, respectively (p=0.32). Six percent of all women reported current use of alcohol 
at the first trimester interview, and this did not differ by pregnancy intention (p=0.20). In the 
youngest age group (ages 18 to 20) who are not old enough to drink legally, 35% consumed 
alcohol at some point during pregnancy and this was significantly more likely among those 
with unintended pregnancies (39% vs 27%, p<0.001).
Women who recently quit using alcohol had higher median weekly alcohol consumption 
prior to quitting compared to women who continued to drink throughout pregnancy in both 
intended and unintended pregnancies (Table 2). Among women who stopped drinking 
during pregnancy, those with intended and unintended pregnancies consumed a median of 2 
drinks per week (Interquartile Range [IQR]: 1.0–3.0 for both groups, p=0.96). In the group 
that continued to drink alcohol at the first trimester interview, women with intended and 
unintended pregnancies consumed a median of 1 drink per week (IQR for both: 0.25–3.0, 
p=0.25). During pregnancy, 90% of women with alcohol consumption reported a change in 
drinking pattern. Of these women with a change in pattern, 90% ceased consumption, 8% 
reduced consumption, and 2% of women increased alcohol intake. In women that changed 
drinking pattern, the median number of alcoholic beverages consumed was 2 per week 
before the change (IQR: 0.92–4.0). At the first trimester interview, the median number of 
alcoholic beverages consumed among those still drinking was 0.92 drinks per week (IQR: 
0.23–2.0) and did not differ based on pregnancy intention (p=0.36). The median gestational 
age at which a change in drinking status occurred was 29 days (IQR: 15–35) (Figure 2). 
When stratifying this change in alcohol use by pregnancy intention, women with intended 
pregnancies made the change an average of 3 days earlier (28 days, IQR: 14–34, vs 31 days, 
IQR: 17–38.
After adjusting for maternal age, race/ethnicity, marital status, maternal education level, 
income, parity, BMI, prenatal vitamin use, spontaneous or elective abortion history, 
smoking, and drug use women with intended pregnancies had 31% lower odds of alcohol 
consumption in pregnancy compared to women with unintended pregnancies (aOR: 0.69, 
95% CI: 0.60–0.81). Women who were older, white, college educated, had higher incomes, 
and having their first pregnancy were most likely to use alcohol in pregnancy (Table 3).
Women with intended pregnancies were 32% less likely (aOR: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.54–0.86) to 
have at least one episode of binge drinking at any point in pregnancy compared to 
participants with unintended pregnancies. Women with intended pregnancies were 39% 
(aOR: 0.61, 95% CI: 0.41–0.92) less likely to have five or more episodes of binge drinking 
in pregnancy compared to those with unintended pregnancies (p=0.02). Characteristics

 associated with binge drinking included younger age, being unmarried, past or current 
smoking, and illicit drug use.
DISCUSSION
Even though women with intended pregnancies are less likely to report using alcohol in 
early pregnancy than women with unintended pregnancies, alcohol use is still prevalent 
among women intending to conceive. The use of alcohol among women with intended 
pregnancies in the cohort was 55%, which parallels CDC findings of alcohol use among 
approximately 50% of women of childbearing age[2].
The majority of women with periconception alcohol exposure stop or curtail use around the 
time of a positive pregnancy test as indicated by mean gestational age at which women 
stopped or decreased alcohol use in this study (23.4 days ± SD: 19). This mean time of 
change is shortly after conception suggesting that women hoping to be pregnant may reduce 
use until missed menses and then return "to normal" if they are not pregnant. If pregnancy is 
achieved, the woman may maintain abstinence from alcohol or decrease use shortly after 
pregnancy recognition. Taking into account confounders, continuing to use alcohol in 
pregnancy is less likely but still occurs among those with intended pregnancies.
Women who continue to use alcohol in the range of two to three drinks per week may be 
overlooked because they defy clinical and cultural biases about who may be most likely to 
drink during pregnancy (white, older, more educated women with higher income). These 
predictors are consistent with findings by Tan and colleagues using the Behavioral Risk 
Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), a state-based random digit telephone survey to collect 
data on multiple maternal behaviors [2]. Providers should not conflate wanting a pregnancy 
with likelihood that an individual will avoid all potential risks. This population demonstrates 
substantial voluntary risk reduction before the onset of prenatal care. However we do not 
find that elimination of all alcohol use when planning a pregnancy is the norm before the 
awareness of pregnancy.
Our study has limitations. As no reliable marker for alcohol use is readily available, our data 
on alcohol exposure and timing were obtained from interviews that can be subject to 
reporting and recall bias. It has been noted in multiple studies that there is always a concern 
for underreporting of maternal alcohol use in pregnancy, largely due to social stigma. We 
attempted to minimize recall bias by obtaining the exposure information early in pregnancy 
via a non-clinical interview in which confidentiality was assured. Another important 
limitation is the self-reported pregnancy intention. It is possible that some women did not 
desire a pregnancy initially but reported an intended pregnancy after becoming pregnant. 
Finally, some mothers failed to provide detailed information on quantity and frequency of 
alcohol consumption.
Our study provides unique insight into the alcohol use patterns of pregnant women. This 
study, in contrast with previous studies, prospectively examines maternal alcohol use in the 
periconception period as well as during the first trimester. This cohort was also comprised of

 a large proportion of intended pregnancies, which provides a unique ability to observe 
alcohol use in women who wish to become pregnant.
As a public health strategy, our data suggest that the majority of women, regardless of 
pregnancy intention, stop or decrease alcohol use around the time of a positive pregnancy 
test. This implies that promoting earlier pregnancy awareness by testing near the time of 
anticipated menses may be a more beneficial strategy for decreasing alcohol use in 
pregnancy than encouraging abstinence from alcohol among all women who could conceive. 
The latter does not seem likely to be achieved while the former results in relatively prompt 
reductions in alcohol consumption. Any remaining use, and evaluation for high risk 
behaviors such as underage alcohol use and binge drinking (a separate phenomenon), can 
then become the focus of early clinical encounters but must be extended to all pregnant 
women not just those perceived as high risk based on traditional socioeconomic markers of 
risk for poor pregnancy outcomes. Reducing unintended pregnancy is another important 
public health endeavor and can be accomplished by enhanced contraceptive access, 
improved counseling, and anticipatory guidance.
