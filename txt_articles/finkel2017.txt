BACKGROUND
Spinal muscular atrophy is an autosomal recessive neuromuscular disorder that is 
caused by an insufficient level of survival motor neuron (SMN) protein. Nusinersen 
is an antisense oligonucleotide drug that modifies pre–messenger RNA splicing of 
the SMN2 gene and thus promotes increased production of full-length SMN protein.
METHODS
We conducted a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled, phase 3 efficacy and 
safety trial of nusinersen in infants with spinal muscular atrophy. The primary end 
points were a motor-milestone response (defined according to results on the Ham-
mersmith Infant Neurological Examination) and event-free survival (time to death 
or the use of permanent assisted ventilation). Secondary end points included over-
all survival and subgroup analyses of event-free survival according to disease dura-
tion at screening. Only the first primary end point was tested in a prespecified 
interim analysis. To control the overall type I error rate at 0.05, a hierarchical 
testing strategy was used for the second primary end point and the secondary end 
points in the final analysis.
RESULTS
In the interim analysis, a significantly higher percentage of infants in the nusin-
ersen group than in the control group had a motor-milestone response (21 of 51 
infants [41%] vs. 0 of 27 [0%], P<0.001), and this result prompted early termination 
of the trial. In the final analysis, a significantly higher percentage of infants in the 
nusinersen group than in the control group had a motor-milestone response (37 of 
73 infants [51%] vs. 0 of 37 [0%]), and the likelihood of event-free survival was 
higher in the nusinersen group than in the control group (hazard ratio for death or 
the use of permanent assisted ventilation, 0.53; P 
= 
0.005). The likelihood of overall 
survival was higher in the nusinersen group than in the control group (hazard ratio 
for death, 0.37; P 
= 
0.004), and infants with a shorter disease duration at screening 
were more likely than those with a longer disease duration to benefit from nusinersen. 
The incidence and severity of adverse events were similar in the two groups.
CONCLUSIONS
Among infants with spinal muscular atrophy, those who received nusinersen were 
more likely to be alive and have improvements in motor function than those in the 
control group. Early treatment may be necessary to maximize the benefit of the 
drug. (Funded by Biogen and Ionis Pharmaceuticals; ENDEAR ClinicalTrials.gov

S
pinal muscular atrophy is an auto-
somal recessive neuromuscular disorder that 
is characterized by progressive muscle atro-
phy and weakness, with an estimated incidence 
of 1 in 11,000 live births.1,2 Approximately 60% of 
infants who are born with spinal muscular atro-
phy have type 1 disease,3 which is characterized 
by onset of symptoms at 6 months of age or 
younger and a median life expectancy of less than 
2 years without respiratory support.3-5 New devel-
opmental motor milestones are rarely achieved 
after diagnosis.6
Spinal muscular atrophy is caused by a homo-
zygous deletion or mutation in the survival motor 
neuron 1 (SMN1) gene, which results in decreased 
expression of the survival motor neuron (SMN) 
protein and degeneration of motor neurons in 
the spinal cord and brain stem.7,8 A paralogous 
gene, survival motor neuron 2 (SMN2), also en-
codes the SMN protein; however, 90 to 95% of 
the translated protein is truncated and nonfunc-
tional as a result of aberrant splicing.9,10 Infants 
with a higher copy number of SMN2 generally 
have a milder phenotype.8 Therefore, modulation 
of pre–messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) splicing of 
SMN2 to promote increased production of SMN 
protein could be an effective treatment strategy 
across the disease spectrum of spinal muscular 
atrophy.
Nusinersen is an antisense oligonucleotide 
drug that modifies pre-mRNA splicing of SMN2 
to promote increased production of full-length 
SMN protein.11 In a phase 2, open-label, dose-
escalation study of nusinersen in infantile-onset 
spinal muscular atrophy, infants who received 
nusinersen had progressive improvements in 
motor function and prolonged survival, relative 
to data from a published natural-history case 
series.12 We report the final results of the ENDEAR 
trial, a 13-month, international, randomized, 
multicenter, sham-controlled, phase 3 trial that 
assessed the clinical efficacy and safety of 
nusinersen in infants who had received a genetic 
diagnosis of spinal muscular atrophy, had two 
copies of SMN2 (which is subject to copy-number 
variation), and had had onset of symptoms at 
6 months of age or younger.7
Methods
Trial Oversight
The sponsors, Biogen and Ionis Pharmaceuticals, 
designed the trial in collaboration with clinicians 
who had experience in the treatment of spinal 
muscular atrophy. An independent data and safe-
ty monitoring board provided trial oversight in 
collaboration with the sponsors. Investigators col-
lected the data, which was analyzed by the spon-
sors. All the authors contributed to data interpre-
tation and manuscript development, approved the 
manuscript for submission, and vouch for the 
accuracy and completeness of the reported data. 
All the principal investigators agreed to follow 
the protocol and protocol amendments (available 
with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). 
The first draft of the manuscript was written by 
the first author and the senior industry author 
(penultimate author); medical-writing assistance 
was paid for by Biogen. The sponsors reviewed 
the manuscript and provided feedback to the 
authors, who had full editorial control.
Patients
Infants at 31 centers were enrolled in the trial. Eli-
gible infants had genetic documentation of a ho-
mozygous deletion or mutation in the SMN1 gene. 
They also had two copies of the SMN2 gene, had 
had onset of clinical symptoms that were consis-
tent with spinal muscular atrophy at 6 months of 
age or younger, were 7 months of age or younger 
at screening, did not have low peripheral oxygen 
saturation, and met all additional eligibility cri-
teria (see the Supplementary Appendix, available 
at NEJM.org). A health care proxy for each patient 
provided written informed consent. The trial was 
approved by an ethics committee at each institu-
tion and was conducted in accordance with the 
International Conference on Harmonisation guide-
lines for Good Clinical Practice and with the World 
Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki.
Trial Design and Treatment
After a screening period of up to 21 days, eligible 
infants were randomly assigned, in a 2:1 ratio, 
to undergo intrathecal administration of nusiner-
sen (nusinersen group) or a sham procedure (con-
trol group). The nusinersen dose was adjusted 
according to the estimated volume of cerebrospi-
nal fluid for the infant’s age on the day of dos-
ing, such that the infant received a dose that was 
equivalent to a 12-mg dose in a person 2 years of 
age or older; thus, younger infants were injected 
with smaller volumes that contained lower doses 
of the drug. To maintain blinding, nusinersen 
was administered or the sham procedure was 
performed by dedicated trial personnel who were

aware of the group assignments, whereas the 
infant’s parents and key trial personnel who were 
responsible for assessments were unaware of 
the group assignments and were not present for 
the procedure. The sham procedure consisted of 
a small needle prick to the skin over the lumbar 
spine, which was covered with a bandage to 
simulate the appearance of a lumbar-puncture 
injection. Randomization was stratified accord-
ing to disease duration at screening, which was 
the age at screening minus the age at symptom 
onset (≤12 weeks or >12 weeks).
Trial Procedures and Outcomes
In the nusinersen group, doses were administered 
on days 1, 15, 29, and 64 and maintenance doses 
on days 183 and 302. In the control group, sham 
procedures were performed on the same days. 
Efficacy end points were assessed on days 64, 
183, 302, and 394 (±7 days for each visit). Safety-
monitoring visits occurred on days 16, 30, 65, 
184, and 303. Follow-up after the procedure con-
sisted of weekly assessments by telephone and 
a visit to the study center on day 394 (±7 days). 
A prespecified interim analysis was performed by 
the sponsor and the data and safety monitoring 
board when approximately 80 infants had been 
enrolled for at least 6 months (Fig. S1 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). The analysis showed 
a benefit–risk assessment in favor of nusinersen. 
This result prompted early termination of the 
trial. At that time, infants were invited to com-
plete an end-of-trial visit at least 2 weeks after 
they had received their most recent dose of nusin-
ersen or undergone their most recent sham proce-
dure. The assessments that were scheduled to be 
performed on day 394 were performed at the end-
of-trial visit. Infants who completed the ENDEAR 
trial were invited to enroll in the open-label ex-
tension study SHINE (ClinicalTrials.gov number, 
NCT02594124).
The trial had two primary efficacy end points. 
The first was a motor-milestone response, which 
was defined according to results on the Hammer-
smith Infant Neurological Examination (HINE). 
The HINE is a three-section, 37-item, quantifiable 
assessment of overall neurologic function in in-
fants.13 Section 2 of the HINE (HINE-2) assesses 
the development of motor function through the 
achievement of motor milestones; scores on the 
HINE-2 range from 0 to 26, with higher scores 
indicating better motor function.13,14 The HINE-2 
involves evaluation in eight motor-milestone cat-
egories: voluntary grasp, kicking, head control, 
rolling, sitting, crawling, standing, and walking. 
For this primary end point, infants who had been 
enrolled for at least 6 months were evaluated in 
seven of the eight categories (excluding volun-
tary grasp) at screening, before the procedure on 
days 183 and 302, and on day 394. The infants 
were considered to have a motor-milestone re-
sponse if they met the following two criteria: 
improvement in at least one category (i.e., an in-
crease in the score for head control, rolling, sit-
ting, crawling, standing, or walking of ≥1 point, 
an increase in the score for kicking of ≥2 points, 
or achievement of the maximal score for kicking) 
and more categories with improvement than 
categories with worsening (i.e., a decrease in the 
score for head control, rolling, sitting, crawling, 
standing, or walking of ≥1 point or a decrease in 
the score for kicking of ≥2 points). Infants who 
died or were withdrawn from the trial were con-
sidered to have had no response, regardless of 
whether they attended the visit on day 183.
The second primary efficacy end point was 
event-free survival, which was defined as the time 
to death or the use of permanent assisted venti-
lation (tracheostomy or ventilatory support for 
≥16 hours per day for >21 continuous days in the 
absence of an acute reversible event). The use of 
permanent assisted ventilation as of days 91, 182, 
273, 364, and 394 was determined on the basis 
of patient data from parental diaries and hospi-
tal records obtained at those visits. All events of 
permanent assisted ventilation were adjudicated 
by an independent end-point adjudication commit-
tee whose members were unaware of the group 
assignments.
Descriptions of the six secondary end points 
are provided in the Supplementary Appendix. 
Scores on the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia 
Infant Test of Neuromuscular Disorders (CHOP 
INTEND) range from 0 to 64, with higher scores 
indicating better motor function; a CHOP INTEND 
response was defined as an increase of at least 
4 points from baseline in the CHOP INTEND 
score at the end-of-trial visit (day 183, 302, or 
394).15,16 A compound muscle action potential 
(CMAP) response was defined as an increase in 
the peroneal CMAP amplitude to at least 1 mV (or 
maintenance of an amplitude of ≥1 mV) at the 
end-of-trial visit (day 183, 302, or 394). Adverse 
events included all untoward events that occurred 
during the trial period, including those that were 
expected to occur in a population of infants with

spinal muscular atrophy; details are provided in 
the Supplementary Appendix. Other safety assess-
ments included vital-sign measurements, labora-
tory tests, and neurologic examinations.
Statistical Analysis
In accordance with the statistical analysis plan, 
only the first primary efficacy end point was sta-
tistically assessed in the interim analysis. Because 
the P value for the first primary end point was 
significant in the interim analysis, this end 
point was not tested for significance in the final 
analysis. The second primary efficacy end point 
and all secondary efficacy end points were as-
sessed in the final analysis. A hierarchical test-
ing strategy was used to control the overall type I 
error rate at 0.05; in the final analysis, end points 
were ranked and tested for statistical significance 
in a hierarchical order (see the Supplementary 
Appendix).17
The difference between the nusinersen group 
and the control group in the proportion of infants 
who had a motor-milestone response was ana-
lyzed with the use of Fisher’s exact test. Event-free 
survival and overall survival were assessed with 
the use of a log-rank test that was stratified ac-
cording to disease duration at screening (≤12 weeks 
or >12 weeks). The median time to death or the 
use of permanent assisted ventilation in each 
group and associated 95% confidence intervals 
were estimated with the use of the Kaplan–Meier 
product-limit method; probability of survival was 
estimated with the use of the Kaplan–Meier 
method. A hazard ratio for death or the use of 
permanent assisted ventilation and a hazard ratio 
for death were calculated with the use of a Cox 
proportional-hazards model that was adjusted 
for disease duration at screening in each infant. 
A hazard ratio of less than 1.00 indicated a lower 
risk of an event in the nusinersen group than 
in the control group. For details about patients 
included in the final analysis, see Figure S1 in 
the Supplementary Appendix.
Results
Patients
A total of 149 infants were screened, and 122 
underwent randomization (81 were assigned to 
the nusinersen group, and 41 to the control 
group). One infant in the nusinersen group was 
withdrawn from the trial before treatment; 121 
infants underwent the assigned procedure. The 
first infant was treated on August 21, 2014, and 
the last infant’s last visit was on November 21, 
2016. Baseline characteristics were generally bal-
anced between the two groups, except for age at 
the time of diagnosis of spinal muscular atro-
phy, use of ventilatory support, and the presence 
of symptoms specific to spinal muscular atrophy; 
the infants in the nusinersen group had earlier 
onset of symptoms and greater burden of disease 
than the infants in the control group (although 
formal statistical testing was not performed) 
(Table 1). At baseline, all the infants were symp-
tomatic, hypotonic, and weak; these features are 
consistent with a phenotype that is most likely 
to be classified as spinal muscular atrophy type 1. 
The median duration of disease at screening was 
13.1 weeks. (For details, see Table S1 and Fig. S2 
in the Supplementary Appendix.)
Efficacy
Primary End Points
For the prespecified interim analysis, the clinical 
cutoff date was June 15, 2016. In the interim 
analysis, a significantly higher percentage of in-
fants in the nusinersen group than in the control 
group had a motor-milestone response (41% vs. 
0%, P<0.001) (Table 2). These results prompted 
early termination of the trial, and infants were 
evaluated at end-of-trial visits.
For the final analysis, the 121 infants (80 in 
the nusinersen group and 41 in the control group) 
who had undergone randomization and the as-
signed procedure at least one time were included 
in time-to-event analyses, and the 110 infants 
(73 in the nusinersen group and 37 in the control 
group) who had been enrolled at least 6 months 
before the last infant’s last visit were included in 
all other analyses. In the final analysis, 51% of 
the infants in the nusinersen group and no in-
fants in the control group had a motor-milestone 
response (Table 2 and Fig. 1). In the nusinersen 
group, 22% of the infants achieved full head 
control, 10% were able to roll over, 8% were able 
to sit independently, and 1% were able to stand; 
in the control group, no infants achieved these 
milestones. (For details, see Figs. S1 and S4 in 
the Supplementary Appendix.)
The likelihood of event-free survival was sig-
nificantly higher in the nusinersen group than in 
the control group, most notably among infants 
who had a disease duration at screening that

was no longer than the median duration of 13.1 
weeks (Table 2 and Fig. 2A, and Fig. S6A in the 
Supplementary Appendix). By the cutoff date for 
the final analysis, 39% of the infants in the 
nusinersen group and 68% in the control group 
had died or had received permanent assisted 
ventilation. The median time to death or the use 
of permanent assisted ventilation was 22.6 weeks 
in the control group and was not reached in the 
nusinersen group. Overall, the risk of death or 
the use of permanent assisted ventilation was 
47% lower in the nusinersen group than in the 
control group (hazard ratio, 0.53; 95% confidence 
interval [CI], 0.32 to 0.89; P 
= 
0.005).
Secondary End Points
A significantly higher percentage of infants in 
the nusinersen group than in the control group 
had a CHOP INTEND response (71% vs. 3%, 
P<0.001). An increase of at least 1 point from 
baseline in the CHOP INTEND score was ob-
served in 73% of the infants in the nusinersen 
group versus 3% in the control group; a decrease 
in the score was observed in 7% versus 49% (Fig. 
S7 in the Supplementary Appendix).
A lower percentage of infants in the nusiner-
sen group than in the control group had died by 
the end of the trial (16% vs. 39%) (Fig. 2B). The 
risk of death was 63% lower in the nusinersen 
group than in the control group (hazard ratio, 
0.37; 95% CI, 0.18 to 0.77; P 
= 
0.004) (Table 2).
An estimated 15% of the infants in the nusin-
ersen group and 8% in the control group had re-
ceived permanent assisted ventilation at 3 months, 
and an estimated 31% and 48%, respectively, 
had received permanent assisted ventilation at 
13 months. Overall, 23% of the infants in the 
nusinersen group and 32% in the control group 
received permanent assisted ventilation (hazard 
ratio, 0.66; P 
= 
0.13) (Table 2). Because the P value 
for this end point was not significant, all subse-
quent end-point analyses in the hierarchical test-
ing strategy were considered to be exploratory. 
By the end of the trial, 36% of the infants in the 
nusinersen group and 5% in the control group 
had had a CMAP response (Table 2). In the sub-
group analyses, the likelihood of event-free sur-
vival was higher among infants who had a shorter 
disease duration at screening (≤13.1 weeks) than 
among those who had a longer disease duration 
(Table 2). (For details, see Figs. S6 and S8 in the 
Supplementary Appendix.)
Additional Prespecified Analyses
Among infants who were alive at the end of the 
trial and had been enrolled for at least 6 months, 
most of the infants in the nusinersen group had 
an increase from baseline in the HINE-2 score;

The prespecified interim analysis was conducted on June 15, 2016, and included the 78 infants (51 in the nusinersen 
group and 27 in the control group) who had been enrolled for at least 6 months. Only motor-milestone response was 
tested in the interim analysis. All other end points were tested in the final analysis, which was conducted with the use 
of data collected up to the date of the last patient’s last visit (November 21, 2016). For the final analysis, the 121 pa-
tients who had undergone randomization and the assigned procedure at least one time were included in time-to-event 
analyses, and the 110 patients who had been enrolled at least 6 months before the last patient’s last visit were included

Motor-milestone response was defined according to scores on the HINE-2, which assesses the development of motor 
function through the achievement of motor milestones; in this trial, the scores accounted for seven of the eight motor-
milestone categories, excluding voluntary grasp. Infants were considered to have a motor-milestone response if they 
met the following two criteria: improvement in at least one category (i.e., an increase in the score for head control, roll-
ing, sitting, crawling, standing, or walking of ≥1 point, an increase in the score for kicking of ≥2 points, or achievement 
of the maximal score for kicking) and more categories with improvement than categories with worsening (i.e., a decrease 
in the score for head control, rolling, sitting, crawling, standing, or walking of ≥1 point or a decrease in the score for 
kicking of ≥2 points).
‡  
Permanent assisted ventilation was defined as tracheostomy or ventilatory support for at least 16 hours per day for more 
than 21 continuous days in the absence of an acute reversible event, as determined by an independent end-point adju-
dication committee.
§  
To control for a type I error rate at 0.05, a hierarchical testing strategy was used, in which statistical significance of the 
first primary end point was required before inferential conclusions could be drawn about the second primary end point 
and secondary end points. Testing of subsequent end points for statistical significance was contingent on the achieve-
ment of statistical significance for the previous end point analyzed. Secondary end points are listed in hierarchical order. 
Because the P value for the third secondary end point was not significant, all subsequent end-point analyses in the hier-
archical testing strategy were considered to be exploratory. (For details, see the Supplementary Appendix.)
¶  
A CHOP INTEND response was defined as an increase of at least 4 points from baseline in CHOP INTEND score at the 
end-of-trial visit (day 183, 302, or 394).
‖  
A CMAP response was defined as an increase in the peroneal CMAP amplitude to at least 1 mV (or maintenance of an 
amplitude of ≥1 mV) at the end-of-trial visit (day 183, 302, or 394).

Nusinersen in Spinal Muscular Atrophy
(For details, see Figs. S3A and S5A in the Supple-
mentary Appendix.)
Safety
The overall incidence of adverse events was 
similar in the nusinersen group and the control 
group (96% and 98%, respectively) (Table 3). A 
lower percentage of infants in the nusinersen 
group than in the control group had a severe 
adverse event (56% vs. 80%), a serious adverse 
event (76% vs. 95%), or an adverse event that led 
to discontinuation of nusinersen or the control 
procedure (16% vs. 39%) (Table 3). All the adverse 
events that led to discontinuation had fatal out-
comes (Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). 
Adverse events that were reported within 72 hours 
after the administration of nusinersen or the 
sham procedure and adverse events that were 
reported in more than 5% of the infants in the 
nusinersen group are listed in Tables S3 and S4 
in the Supplementary Appendix, respectively. 
Otherwise, there were no meaningful between-
group differences in the types of adverse events 
reported. Laboratory test results did not reveal 
a specific pattern among infants who received 
nusinersen. (For details about adverse events and 
laboratory test results, see the Safety Assess-
ments Section in the Supplementary Appendix.)
Discussion
In the ENDEAR trial, among infants with spinal 
muscular atrophy, those who received intrathecal 
nusinersen were more likely to have improvements 
Figure 1. HINE-2 Scores.
Shown are the scores on Section 2 of the Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination (HINE-2) at baseline and 
at the end-of-trial visit (on day 183, 302, or 394) (diamonds), as well as the change in HINE-2 score from baseline 
through the end-of-trial visit (bars), for the 78 infants who were alive, attended an end-of-trial visit, and were included 
in the final analysis. (Of the 110 infants who were included in the final analysis, 29 died [13 in the nusinersen group 
and 16 in the control group] and 3 were withdrawn for a reason other than death [2 in the nusinersen group and 1 in 
the control group] and therefore were not included in this analysis.) The HINE-2 assesses the development of motor 
function through the achievement of motor milestones; scores on the HINE-2 range from 0 to 26, with higher scores 
indicating better motor function. The scores shown here account for seven of the eight motor-milestone categories, 
excluding voluntary grasp. For the infant in the control group who had a 1-point increase, the increase was in the 
score for kicking, and therefore the infant was not considered to have a motor-milestone response. The shortest 
bars indicate a value of 0. Triangles indicate infants who had a disease duration of 12 weeks or less at screening. 
Stars indicate infants who received permanent assisted ventilation during the trial.

in motor function and to be alive without the 
use of permanent assisted ventilation than those 
who underwent a sham procedure. These results 
validate the results of an open-label, phase 2 
study of nusinersen in infantile-onset spinal 
muscular atrophy.12 Although the baseline char-
acteristics of the infants were generally balanced 
between the nusinersen group and the control 
group, infants in the nusinersen group had ear-
lier symptom onset and greater disease burden 
at baseline than did those in the control group. 
The between-group difference in the proportion 
of infants who had a motor-milestone response 
(based on the HINE-2 score) increased over time. 
Most infants with spinal muscular atrophy type 1 
are unable to achieve or maintain most motor 
milestones.6 Several of the infants in the nusiner-
sen group achieved clinically meaningful motor 
milestones. The increase in the CHOP INTEND 
score and the CMAP amplitude among infants 
who received nusinersen confirms that nusiner-
sen improves neuromuscular function.
The definitions of response with respect to 
HINE-2 and CHOP INTEND were selected to 
measure deviations from the expected trajectory 
of motor-function decline that was established 
in published natural-history studies for spinal 
muscular atrophy (see the Supplementary Ap-
pendix).5,6,12,15,16 Although the HINE-2 was not 
specifically developed to assess motor function 
in infants with spinal muscular atrophy,13 it can 
be used to identify incremental changes in the 
achievement of motor milestones that are rele-
vant among infants with spinal muscular atro-
phy type 1,12 and the HINE-2 assessment can be 
performed reliably in a multicenter study.14 In-
fants who received nusinersen had a signifi-
cantly higher likelihood of event-free and overall 
survival than infants who underwent a sham 
procedure, despite the fact that more infants in 
the nusinersen group than in the control group 
were receiving ventilatory support at baseline. In 
the final analysis, the between-group difference 
in the percentage of infants who received per-
manent assisted ventilation was not significant; 
however, data were censored for infants who had 
died. Because the proportion of infants who had 
died in the control group was more than twice 
that in the nusinersen group, this analysis may 
have masked the treatment effect of nusinersen 
on the use of permanent assisted ventilation. 
Approximately half the infants in the nusinersen 
group who received permanent assisted ventila-
tion did so within 13 weeks after they received 
the first dose; this result indicates that a mini-
mum treatment time is required to see the full 
benefits of nusinersen. This result, as well as 
our finding that infants with a disease duration 
at screening longer than the median duration of 
13.1 weeks were more likely than those with a 
disease duration no longer than the median du-
ration to need permanent assisted ventilation, 
suggests that early initiation of treatment may 
maximize its efficacy.

Panel A shows the probability of event-free survival (the proportion of in-
fants who were alive without the use of permanent assisted ventilation) 
and Panel B shows the probability of overall survival (the proportion of in-
fants who were alive) in the nusinersen group and the control group. The 
median time to death or the use of permanent assisted ventilation was 
22.6 weeks in the control group and was not reached in the nusinersen 
group; the median time to death was not reached in either group.

Nusinersen in Spinal Muscular Atrophy
The ENDEAR trial was terminated early be-
cause of the results of the interim analysis and 
ethical consideration for the infants in the con-
trol group. Not all the patients underwent the 
assigned procedure for 13 months; for many end 
points, data obtained on day 183, 302, or 394 
were used for the final analysis, which could 
result in outcome variability. Because increasing 
gains were seen up to the last data point collected 
for several outcome measures and because the 
trial was concluded prematurely at the interim 
analysis, the maximum response in the trial 
population is not yet clear.
The majority of the reported adverse events 
were consistent with those expected in a popula-
tion of infants with spinal muscular atrophy and 
were similar to those reported in an open-label 
study in infantile-onset spinal muscular atro-
phy.12,18 No serious safety concerns were identi-
fied during the close monitoring that followed 
the intrathecal injections. Because the infants who 
were enrolled in this trial were nonverbal, adverse 
events that are typically reported by the patient 
(particularly adverse events associated with the 
post–lumbar puncture syndrome, such as back 
pain and headache) may not have been captured. 
However, adverse events associated with the 
post–lumbar puncture syndrome increase in fre-
quency with increasing age and are less common 
in children than adults.19 (For additional discus-
sion of adverse events, see the Supplementary 
Appendix.)
An inherent risk associated with international 
multicenter trials is that differences in standards 
of care among the sites could affect patient out-
comes. However, standard-of-care guidelines18,20 
were incorporated into the trial design to mini-
mize site-to-site variations, and we therefore 
propose that the control group is an accurate 
representation of the natural history of infantile-
onset spinal muscular atrophy. Several of the in-
fants who received nusinersen died, none achieved 
normal motor development, and some needed 
continued feeding and ventilatory support; these 
findings indicate that nusinersen is not a cure in 
symptomatic patients. Infants who were enrolled 
in the ENDEAR trial have been enrolled in the 
open-label extension study SHINE, which is de-
signed to assess the effects of longer treatment 
duration on motor function and quality of life.

For infants who had more than one adverse event, only the event of the high-
est severity was counted.
†  
Severe adverse events were defined as symptoms that caused severe discom-
fort, incapacitation, or substantial effect on daily life.
‡  
Serious adverse events were defined as any untoward medical occurrence that 
resulted in death or a risk of death, hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization, 
persistent or substantial disability or incapacity, or a congenital anomaly or 
birth defect.
§  
These events could plausibly be linked to spinal muscular atrophy.
