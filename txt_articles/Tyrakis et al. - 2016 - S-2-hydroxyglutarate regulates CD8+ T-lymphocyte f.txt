In response to T-cell receptor (TCR) triggering, quiescent CD8+ 
T-lymphocytes transition to a proliferative effector state. During this 
response, memory CD8+ T-lymphocytes form and can persist for the 
life of the organism, mounting rapid recall responses thereby providing 
long-term immunity. The metabolic programs of these different CD8+ 
T-lymphocyte states are distinct and important for function1-4. Effector 
CD8+ T-lymphocytes generate most ATP and biomass via glycolysis5; 
both naïve and memory cells rely heavily on oxidative phosphorylation 6,7. 
Various cytokines and transcription factors are important for the differ-
entiation of CD8+ T-lymphocytes, and it is evident that immunological 
memory is influenced by epigenetic mechanisms8-12.
CD8+ T-lymphocytes traffic into severely hypoxic zones within 
tumours and inflammatory tissue13. The response to oxygenation 
mediated via the Von Hipple Lindau (VHL) and hypoxia inducible 
transcription factor α 
 (HIFα 
) proteins, is an essential regulator of 
metabolism and CD8+ T-lymphocyte function14-16. Here we demon-
strate that CD8+ T-lymphocytes produce 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) in 
response to TCR triggering and environmental hypoxia. Using CD8+ 
T-lymphocyte specific genetic deletions of VHL, HIF-1α 
 and HIF-2α 
, 
we highlight the dependency of this metabolic feature on the HIF path-
way. S-2HG constitutes the majority of the 2HG pool and we show that 
S-2HG alters the phenotypic and functional characteristics of CD8+ 
T-lymphocytes, maintaining a state of increased proliferative, survival 
and anti-tumour capacity.
The VHL-HIF-1α axis regulates 2HG production
To elucidate metabolic effects of HIFα 
 activation, we profiled the 
metabolome of CD8+ T-lymphocytes with low (Vhlfl/fl), or high (Vhlfl/fl 
dlckcre referred to as Vhl-/-) HIF signalling, and HIF-1α 
-VHL double 
knockouts (Hif1αfl/flVhlfl/fldlckcre referred to as Hif1α 
-/-Vhl-/-) to control 
for a specific contribution of HIF-1α 
14. Unsupervised clustering and 
principal component analysis (Fig. 1a, b) separate Vhl-/- from Vhlfl/fl  
CD8+ T-lymphocytes. Vhl-/-Hif1α 
-/- cluster with Vhlfl/fl, indicating that 
HIF-1α 
 mediates significant metabolic changes following Vhl deletion. 
 
Glycolysis is critical for sustaining effector function1-3,17 and these 
data indicate that VHL suppresses glycolysis via inhibition of HIF-1α 
, 
 
(Extended Data Fig. 1a-c).
VHL loss suppresses late and increases early tricarboxylic acid 
(TCA) cycle intermediates (Extended Data Fig. 1a). Strikingly, 2HG 
is significantly enriched in Vhl-/- CD8+ T-lymphocytes (Fig. 1c and 
Extended Data Fig. 1d). Furthermore, increases in 2HG depend on 
HIF-1α 
 when VHL is deleted (Extended Data Fig. 1a). This was vali-
dated using quantitative mass spectrometry in Vhl-/- and Vhl-/-Hif1-/- 
CD8+ T-lymphocytes (Fig. 1d), as well as in VHL-null cell lines, that 
express either HIF-1α (RCC4) or HIF-2α (786-O), reconstituted with 
VHL (Fig. 1e and Extended Data Fig. 1e). Deletion of Vhl in murine 
embryonic fibroblasts from Vhlfl/fl mice increases 2HG levels (Fig. 1f 
 
and Extended Data Fig. 1f). Hence, the VHL-HIF axis regulates 
2HG levels and constitutive HIF-1α 
 signalling underlies this effect in 
 
Vhl-null CD8+ T-lymphocytes.
HIF-1α regulates S-2HG production
R-2HG is produced by isocitrate dehydrogenase 1/2 mutations in 
different cancers18-20; accumulation of S-2HG, the other enantiomer 
of 2HG, occurs in the context of hypoxia21,22 and mitochondrial 
dysfunction23,24. We thus sought to determine 2HG levels in CD8+ 
T-lymphocytes following activation. 2HG before activation and at sea 
level oxygen is undetectable, whereas levels at the same oxygenation 
are elevated 2-4 days after TCR stimulation (Fig. 2a).When activated 
CD8+ T-lymphocytes are exposed to 1% oxygen, the intracellular 
concentration of 2HG reaches millimolar levels (Fig. 2b and Extended 
Data Fig. 2a) and is proportional to the degree of oxygenation (Fig. 2c). 
 
We confirmed this using 1HNMR spectroscopy (Extended Data Fig. 2b). 
 
Given such high levels of 2HG, we sequenced25 Idh1/2, to pre-
clude the unlikely possibility that culturing primary murine CD8+ 
T-lymphocytes in hypoxia gives rise to mutations known to cause 
R-2-hydroxyglutarate accumulates to millimolar levels in cancers with gain-of-function isocitrate dehydrogenase 1/2 
mutations. These levels of R-2-hydroxyglutarate affect 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases. Both R- and S-2-
hydroxyglutarate, the other enantiomer of this metabolite, are detectible in healthy individuals, yet their physiological 
function remains elusive. Here we show that CD8+ T-lymphocytes accumulate 2-hydroxyglutarate in response to T-cell 
receptor triggering. This increases to millimolar levels in physiological oxygen conditions, via a hypoxia inducible factor 
1 alpha-dependent mechanism. S-2-hydroxyglutarate predominates over R-2-hydroxyglutarate in activated T cells, and 
we demonstrate alterations in markers of CD8+ T-lymphocyte differentiation in response to this metabolite. Modulation 
of histone and DNA demethylation as well as hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha stability mediate these effects. S-2-
hydroxyglutarate treatment greatly enhances the in vivo proliferation, persistence and anti-tumour capacity of adoptively 
transferred CD8+ T-lymphocytes. Thus S-2-hydroxyglutarate acts as an immunometabolite that links environmental 
context, via a metabolic-epigenetic axis, to immune fate and function.

R-2HG production in humans18; we found no evidence for such 
mutations (Extended Data Fig. 3a-e). Resolving the enantiomers of 
2HG indicates that S-2HG constitutes the majority of the 2HG pool 
 
(Fig. 2d). Primary human CD8+ T-lymphocytes also accumulate 
S-2HG in hypoxia (Fig. 2e, f), indicating that this phenomenon is not 
limited to murine lymphocytes.
We carried out deletion of loxP-flanked Hif1α or Epas1 (referred to as 
Hif2α) genes in CD8+ T-lymphocytes, with cre recombinase expressed 
under the distal Lck promoter (dlckcre)26 (Extended Data Fig. 2c). 2HG 
accumulation is abolished in Hif1αfl/fl dlckcre (referred to as Hif1α-/-), 
but not Hif2αfl/fl dlckcre (referred to as Hif2α-/-) cells under hypoxia 
(Fig. 2g, h and Extended Data Fig. 2d, e), with no difference in viabil-
ity (Extended Data Fig. 2f). We next examined 2HG levels in vivo, in 
the murine spleen. There is more R-2HG than S-2HG (Fig. 2i); fur-
thermore, the levels of S-2HG are significantly decreased in spleens of 
Hif1αfl/fl dlckcre mice (Fig. 2i), There is also a slight decrease in the levels 
of R-2HG (Fig. 2i). 2HG is present in urine of healthy individuals and 
is elevated in patients with 2HG acidurias27. Hif1αfl/fl dlckcre mice have 
lower levels of S-2HG in urine (Fig. 2j) indicating that HIF-1α 
 in the 
T-lymphocyte (CD4+ and CD8+) compartment makes a contribution 
to S-2HG production in vivo. Activated Hif1α-/- CD8+ T-lymphocytes 
in 21% oxygen have lower 2HG at extended time points (Extended 
Data Fig. 2g), indicating a contribution of HIF-1α 
 in non-hypoxic 
conditions also.
We next sought to determine the metabolic route by which HIF-1α 
promotes S-2HG production in CD8+ T-lymphocytes. Transcriptionally, 
hypoxic CD8+ T-lymphocytes show induction of glycolysis and 
suppression of the TCA cycle (Extended Data Fig. 2h). Moreover, 
TCA cycle intermediates are decreased (Extended Data Fig. 2i). 
 
Recent reports implicate lactate and malate dehydrogenases (Ldha and 
Mdh1/2), as enzymatic sources of S-2HG in hypoxia21,22. In Hif1α-/- 
 
CD8+ T-lymphocytes, the hypoxic expression of these enzymes 
 
suggests that Mdh1 and Mdh2 are unlikely to mediate the hypoxia- 
induced accumulation of S-2HG (Extended Data Fig. 2j). Confirming 
this, knockdown of Mdh1 or Mdh2 does not decrease S-2HG in hypoxia 
(Extended Data Fig. 2k-m); knockdown of Mdh1 leads to marginal 
increases in S-2HG (Extended Data Fig. 2l). Knockdown of Mdh1 or 
Mdh2 increases R-2HG levels (Extended Data Fig. 2l, m). Knockdown 
of Ldha (Extended Data Fig. 2k) decreases S-2HG (Fig. 2k), whilst 
 
also increasing R-2HG levels in hypoxic CD8+ T-lymphocytes 
(Extended Data Fig. 2n).Over-expression of Ldha in hypoxic Hif1α-
/- CD8+ T-lymphocytes (Extended Data Fig. 2o) rescues S-2HG 
 
production (Fig. 2l). Consistent with this, Ldha expression in 
 
hypoxic CD8+ T-lymphocytes is HIF-1α 
-dependent (Extended Data 
Fig. 2j).
We next performed 13C-labelling experiments and in agreement 
with previous reports21,23, U-13C-glucose and U-13C-glutamine trac-
ing indicates that glutamine is the major source of 2HG, (Fig. 2m, 
Extended Data Fig 4a-c). The m+ 
5 isotopologue dominates, suggest-
ing direct conversion of glutamine-derived 2-oxoglutarate to 2HG23,21. 
Furthermore, the glutamate pool increases in hypoxic (Extended Data 
Fig. 2p) and Vhl-/- CD8+ T-lymphocytes (Extended Data Fig. 1a) and 
depends on HIF-1α 
 (Extended Data Fig. 2q) but not HIF-2α 
 (Extended 
Data Fig. 2r). Inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase (Pdh) by pyru-
vate dehydrogenase kinases (Pdk), promotes glutaminolysis28-30. We 
 
reasoned that Pdk supports S-2HG production by diverting glutamine- 
derived 2-oxoglutarate to Ldha, and consistent with this, dichloroacetate 
 
(DCA) abrogates hypoxia-induced 2HG accumulation (Extended 
Data Fig. 2s-u). Pdk1 expression is impaired in hypoxic Hif1α-/- CD8+ 
T-lymphocytes (Extended Data Fig. 2j), as is phosphorylation of 
Pdh (Extended Data Fig. 2s), and re-expression of Pdk1 in this con-
text increases S-2HG in hypoxia (Fig. 2l and Extended Data Fig. 2o). 
Inhibition of Pdk activity also impedes hypoxia-induced increases in 
the glutamate pool (Extended Data Fig. 2v). Hence, HIF-1α 
 drives 
S-2HG production in hypoxic CD8+ T-lymphocytes via the Pdk-Pdh 
axis and Ldha induction (Extended Data Fig. 4a).
S-2HG alters CD8+ T-cell differentiation
S-2HG inhibits 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases31,32. Consistent 
with this, HIF-1α 
 is stabilized in normoxic (Extended Data Fig. 5a) 
and hypoxic (Extended Data Fig. 5b) CD8+ T-lymphocytes by treat-
ment with cell permeable S-2HG, suggesting that S-2HG augments 
HIF signalling in normoxia and hypoxia. Additionally, there is 
increased phosphorylation of PDH-E1α 
 (Extended Data Fig. 5a and b), 
 
elevated glucose uptake, lactate secretion (Extended Data Fig. 5c) 
and VEGF-A production (Extended Data Fig. 5d), indicating HIF-1α 
-dependent effects. Since HIF-1α 
 supports effector functions in CD8+ 
T-lymphocytes13,15, we reasoned that S-2HG promotes effector differ-
entiation via HIF-1α 
. However, unexpectedly, there is suppression of 
effector cytokine production (Extended Data Fig. 5e) and decreased 
cytotoxicity (Extended Data Fig. 5f). Furthermore, S-2HG restrains 
cell expansion (Extended Data Fig. 5g) and there is a clear increase in 
apoptosis at doses > 
 300 μ 
M (Extended Data Fig. 5h and i). Further 
characterization reveals decreased secretion of IFN-γ (Extended Data 
Fig. 5j), yet elevated production of IL-2 (Fig. 3a), with increased via-
bility in the absence of IL-2 supplementation (Extended Data Fig. 5k). 
This possibly reflects an autocrine pro-survival effect. These effects are 
robustly mediated at the transcriptional level after prolonged treatment 
with S-2HG (Fig. 3b. Extended Data Fig. 5l) and are independent of 
HIF-1α (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig 5j and k).
We then characterized the phenotype of cells treated with a prolonged 
course of S-2HG. There is increased expression of CD62L (Fig. 3c  
and Extended Data Fig. 5m) and this is reversible upon withdrawal 
of treatment (Extended Data Fig. 5n).The effect does not occur when 
treating cells cultured in vehicle for 7 days (Extended Data Fig. 5n), 
demonstrating that S-2HG treatment of newly activated cells main-
tains this phenotypic marker. Importantly, CD62L downregulation does 
not occur when HIF-1α 
 is absent15, masking the effect of S-2HG on 
CD62L following HIF-1α 
 deletion (Extended Data Fig. 5o). HIF-2α 
 is 
dispensable for CD62L maintenance in response to S-2HG (Extended 
Data Fig. 5p). With S-2HG, CD62L maintenance depends on the level 
of antigenic stimulation (Fig. 3d). Furthermore, S-2HG treated cells 
express more CD127 (Fig. 3c), CD44, 41BB, Eomes and less PD-1 in a 
HIF-1α 
-independent manner (Extended Data Fig. 5q).
To determine the role of endogenously produced S-2HG, over- 
expression of L2hgdh (Extended Data Fig. 5r), a dehydrogenase that 
oxidizes S-2HG, was performed. Over-expression of L2hgdh promotes 
the downregulation of CD62L in both 21% and 1% oxygen (Fig. 3e) 
 
indicating that endogenously produced S-2HG regulates CD62L expres-
sion. Furthermore, L2hgdh over-expression leads to an increase in the 
proportion of KLRG1High cells, which are decreased in the presence 
 
of exogenous S-2HG (Fig. 3f). Conversely, successful shRNA-mediated 
knockdown of L2hgdh by hairpin #3 (Extended Data Fig. 5s) increases 
endogenous S-2HG levels (Fig. 3g), especially in 1% oxygen, promoting 
maintenance of CD62L (Fig. 3h). Suppression of L2hgdh blocks loss of 
CD62L in response to low oxygen (Fig. 3h). The same effect is seen with 
CD127 in low oxygen (Extended Data Fig. 5t). These data demonstrate 
that L2hgdh activity regulates the expression of key phenotypic makers 
 
of CD8+ T-lymphocytes, by controlling endogenous S-2HG levels. 
Transcriptionally, S-2HG treatment increases expression of Eomes, 
Ccr6, Bcl-6, CD62L and Tcf-7, with repression of Prdm1, after 7 days 
(Extended Data Fig. 5u). This transcriptional program is similar to gene 
expression changes in memory CD8+ T-lymphocytes, suggesting that 
S-2HG treatment of CD8+ T-lymphocytes ex vivo may enhance long 
term persistence and survival in the context of adoptive cell transfer33.
We thus co-transferred CFSE-labelled vehicle and S-2HG treated 
CD45.1.1 or CD45.1.2 OT-I CD8+ T-lymphocytes into lymphodepleted 
mice (Extended Data Fig. 6a) to assess their capacity for homeostatic 
proliferation34,35. S-2HG-treated cells display greater homeostatic pro-
liferation (Fig. 4a, b), with more cells dividing > 
5 times (Fig. 4c).We 
then assessed the capacity of S-2HG treated cells to persist in lymphore-
plete mice. Adoptively transferred CD45.1 OT-I CD8+ T-lymphocytes, 
pre-treated with S-2HG, show dramatically enhanced persistence

30 days after transfer (Fig. 4d), expressing elevated CD44, CD127 and 
Bcl-2 levels relative to naïve cells (Fig. 4e)36,37. In response to vacci-
nation with SIINFEKL-loaded dendritic cells, S-2HG-treated OT-I 
CD8+ T-lymphocytes robustly recall (Fig. 4f and Extended Data 
 
Fig. 6b, c). Consistent with this, OT-I CD8+ T-lymphocytes, pre-treated 
with S-2HG are more proficient at controlling tumour growth in vivo in 
both lymphodepleted (Fig. 4g) and lymphoreplete (Fig. 4h) mice. These 
data demonstrate that S-2HG treatment ex vivo maintains cells in a state 
with increased proliferative and survival capacity, when transferred 
 
in vivo, that is otherwise decreased by effector differentiation.
S-2HG alters methylation in CD8+ T-cells
mTOR is a modifier of CD8+ T-lymphocyte differentiation; however, 
we do not observe mTOR inhibition36,38 at doses of S-2HG needed 
for this to occur (Extended Data Fig. 7). S-HG treatment ex vivo may 
be selecting cells that express higher levels of anti-apoptotic genes. 
Two critical anti-apoptotic genes implicated in CD8+ T-lymphocyte 
 
survival are Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl39,40. These genes are not induced by S-2HG 
treatment (Extended Data Fig. 8a-d). Moreover, over-expression of 
Bcl-2 or Bcl-xl (Extended Data Fig. 8e) does not influence the expression 
 
of CD62L, CD44 or CD127 in the presence or absence of S-2HG 
(Extended Data Fig. 8f-i), indicating that S-2HG is exerting these 
 
phenotypic changes independently of Bcl-2 or Bcl-xl.
Inhibition of 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases that demethylate 
 
histones (Jumonji C containing proteins) or oxidise 5-methylcytosine 
in DNA (Ten-eleven translocation (Tet) proteins) may mediate S-2HG’s 
effect 32,41-43. S-2HG alters global levels of various histone methylation 
 
marks (Extended Data Fig. 9a); in particular, di- and tri-methylation 
on H3K27 are reciprocally altered, indicating inhibition of H3K27me3 
demethylation (Fig. 5a, b and Extended Data 9b). The H3K27me2/3 
demethylase, Kdm6a (Utx), is an important regulator of thymocyte 
differentiation44; changes in H3K27me3 levels correlate with genes 
associated with regulation of CD8+ T-lymphocyte differentiation11. 
Global levels of H3K27me3 in CD8+ T-lymphocytes are reduced 
 
following activation, but remain high with S-2HG treatment in a 
HIF-1α 
-independent manner (Fig. 5c and Extended Data Fig. 9c). Utx 
is induced following TCR stimulation (Extended Data Fig. 9d) and 
inhibition of Utx reproduces the effect of S-2HG treatment on CD62L 
expression (Fig. 5d and Extended Data Fig. 9e and f). In vivo, levels of 
H3K27me3 are highest in central memory (CD62LHighCD44High) and 
naïve (CD62LHighCD44Low) CD8+ T-lymphocytes, relative to effectors 
(CD62LLowCD44High) (Fig. 5e). To determine if histone methylation 
changes occur at the transcription start site (TSS) of CD62L with S-HG 
treatment, we performed ChIP-PCR for H3K27me3, H3K4me3 and 
RNA pol II, on naïve and activated CD8+ T-lymphocytes cultured 
with or without S-2HG (Fig. 5f and Extended Data Fig. 9g). We could 
find no enrichment for H3K27me3 at or around the TSS. However, 
naïve and S-2HG treated CD8+ T-lymphocytes have higher enrich-
ment for H3K4me3 at the TSS that is reduced in vehicle-treated cells. 
Additionally, S-2HG treated CD8+ T-lymphocytes have markedly 
higher RNA pol II biding than both naïve and vehicle treated cells. Thus 
S-2HG is promoting CD62L transcription directly with enrichment of 
H3K4me3 at the TSS and indirectly via preservation of H3K27me3 
elsewhere in the genome.
Total levels of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) in genomic DNA are 
largely unchanged by TCR triggering (Fig. 6a). However, total  
levels 
of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) decrease following TCR trig-
gering (Fig. 6a). 5hmC removal in genomic DNA can occur via  
Tet-mediated oxidation (active) as well as DNA replication 
 
(passive)45,46. S-2HG treatment induces small changes in total 5hmC 
and 5mC in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 6b, c); at day 3, there are 
marginally higher levels of 5hmC (statistically non-significant) with no 
changes in 5mC (Fig. 6b, c). This is likely due to decreased prolifera-
tion in the presence of S-2HG (Extended Data Fig 5g). Following sus-
tained treatment, at days 7 and 9, cells have less 5hmC and more 5mC 
 
(Fig. 6b, c). 5mC changes did not reach statistical significance at any 
time point; changes in 5hmC were statistically significant at day 7 only. 
Nonetheless, the changes at days 7 and 9 are consistent with inhibition 
of Tet proteins in the presence of sustained S-2HG treatment.
Tet2 regulates CD4+ T-lymphocyte function and is inhibited by 
2HG47,48. Knockdown of Tet2 recapitulates the effect of S-2HG on 
CD62L, indicating that Tet2 also contributes to CD8+ T-lymphocyte 
effector differentiation (Fig. 6d and Extended Data Fig. 10a), impli-
cating DNA demethylation as an added epigenetic modifier of CD8+ 
T-cell differentiation12. We performed both 5hmC and 5mC DIP-PCR 
around the TSS of CD62L (Fig. 6e and Extended Data Fig 10b). Naïve 
cells have the highest and lowest enrichment for 5hmC and 5mC 
respectively, while S-2HG treated cells display the opposite pattern. 
Vehicle treated cells have an intermediate level of these two marks.
Discussion
Our data support a model in which both Utx and Tet2 contribute to 
effector differentiation of CD8+ T-lymphocytes in vitro. The activity of 
these epigenetic modifiers is altered by S-2HG in a fashion that inhibits 
effector differentiation.
TCR-triggering induced loss of 5hmC in gDNA, whereas 5mC levels 
were relatively stable (Fig. 6a). 5hmC levels stabilized by 4 days after 
activation (Fig. 6a) and S-2HG treatment produced reciprocal changes 
in 5mC and 5hmC levels at later time points (Fig. 6b, c). We investigated 
5mC and 5hmC presence at and around the TSS of CD62L (Fig. 6e). 
S-2HG treatment causes reciprocal 5mC increases and 5hmC decreases 
in this region consistent with inhibition of Tet proteins and transcrip-
tional repression47, yet there is robust expression of CD62L with S-2HG 
treatment (Fig. 3c, d, e and h and Extended Data Fig. 5m-p). Inhibition 
of Tet2 maintains CD62L expression (Fig. 6d and Extended Data 
 
Figure 10a), indicating that S-2HG-induced DNA methylation 
changes elsewhere in the genome may indirectly promote CD62L 
 
expression.
We also investigated H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 patterns at the TSS 
of CD62L (Fig. 5f). S-2HG-treated and naïve CD8+ T-lymphocytes 
have high enrichment for the active H3K4me3 mark49 at the TSS that 
is lost in vehicle-treated cells. At least in S-2HG treated cells, this is 
accompanied by binding of RNA-pol II. Despite global increases in 
H3K27me3 with S-2HG (Fig. 5a-c), the lack of H3K27me3 at the TSS 
of CD62L is not surprising, as this mark is associated with repression49. 
Nevertheless, inhibition of Utx promotes CD62L maintenance (Fig. 5d 
and Extended Data Fig. 9e and f), indicating that H3K27me3 deposi-
tion at other genomic sites can indirectly promote CD62L expression. 
Due to the relationship between histone methylation and other marks 
such as histone acetylation, modulation of the latter may have similar 
effects to those seen with S-2HG treatment50.
Adoptively transferred cells treated with S-2HG ex vivo have an 
increased capacity to proliferate and persist in vivo, with enhanced 
anti-tumour efficacy (Fig. 4), demonstrating a new strategy to improve 
persistence of adoptive cell therapies for cancer. The data presented 
uncover a metabolic-epigenetic axis that controls aspects of T-cell fate. 
Factors regulating endogenous S-2HG levels, such as HIF signalling, 
TCR triggering, L2hdgh activity and potentially others, can alter the 
differentiation of CD8+ T-lymphocytes and thus shape the immune 
response.
