Abstract
IMPORTANCE—The role of amyloid in the progression of Alzheimer disease (AD) 
pathophysiology is of central interest to the design of randomized clinical trials. The presence of 
amyloid has become a prerequisite for enrollment in several secondary prevention trials for AD, 
yet the precise effect of elevated amyloid levels on subsequent clinical and biomarker events is 
less certain.
OBJECTIVE—To explore the effect of elevated amyloid levels on subsequent changes in 
cognition and biomarkers.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS—A total of 564 cognitively normal individuals 
(median age, 78 years) from the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging, a population-based longitudinal 
study in Olmsted County, Minnesota, with serial cognitive data were selected for this study. The 
data used in this study were collected from January 12, 2006, to January 9, 2014. Individuals 
included in this study had undergone magnetic resonance imaging, fluorodeoxyglucose positron

 emission tomography (FDG-PET), and Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) PET at baseline were not 
cognitively impaired at baseline and had at least 1 clinical follow-up. A subset of 286 individuals 
also underwent serial imaging. Elevated amyloid level was defined as a standardized uptake value 
ratio of greater than 1.5 on PiB PET. Associations with baseline amyloid status and baseline and 
longitudinal change in clinical and imaging measures were evaluated after adjusting for age and 
hippocampal volume. APOE4 effects were also evaluated.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES—Cognitive measures of memory, language, attention/
executive function, visuospatial skills, PiB levels, hippocampal and ventricular volumes, and 
FDG-PET measures.
RESULTS—At baseline, 179 (31.7%) individuals with elevated amyloid levels had poorer 
cognition in all domains measured, reduced hippocampal volume, and greater FDG-PET 
hypometabolism. Elevated amyloid levels at baseline were associated with a greater rate of 
cognitive decline in all domains (0.04 to 0.09 z score units per year) except language and a greater 
rate of amyloid accumulation (1.6% per year), hippocampal atrophy (30 mm3 per year), and 
ventricular enlargement (565 mm3 per year). Elevated amyloid levels were also associated with an 
increased risk of mild cognitive impairment (hazard ratio, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.7–5.0, and hazard ratio, 
1.6; 95% CI, 0.9–2.8, for PiB+ APOE4 carriers and PiB+ noncarriers, respectively, compared with 
PiB− noncarriers). These associations were largely independent of APOE4.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE—In persons selected from a population-based study, 
elevated amyloid levels at baseline were associated with worse cognition and imaging biomarkers 
at baseline and with greater clinical decline and neurodegeneration. These results have 
implications for the design of randomized clinical trials for AD.
Previous models for the putative progression of pathophysiology in Alzheimer disease (AD) 
assert that the deposition of β-amyloid is an initiating event followed by indexes of 
neurodegeneration, such as brain glucose hypometabolism and atrophy.1–4 However, recent 
evidence indicates that the temporal progression of events may need to include alternative 
scenarios.5,6 Nevertheless, many current models address the importance of amyloid in 
playing an early role in the neurodegeneration that leads to AD. After these 
neurodegenerative events have taken place, cognitive changes manifest.1–3With this 
framework as a foundation, the National Institute on Aging and the Alzheimer Association 
revised the criteria for the AD spectrum to include a preclinical state in which individuals 
have no clinical symptoms but may harbor the biologic underpinnings of the AD process.7
Several secondary prevention trials are currently being conducted or planned that operate on 
the premise that amyloid positivity implies the development of more rapid clinical 
impairment; although this hypothesis is plausible, the data supporting this approach are 
inconclusive.8 It is unclear whether amyloid positivity is sufficient to enrich a trial. Some 
data have been generated concerning cognitive changes among cognitively normal (CN) 
individuals with and without amyloid,9–11 but relatively little is known about the 
progression of neurodegenerative markers by amyloid status and virtually none in randomly 
sampled individuals from the community.12,13

 elevated amyloid levels on subsequent changes in cognition and, in a subset of individuals 
with serial imaging data, changes instructural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), 
fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), and accumulation of 
amyloid.
Methods
The MCSA is a population-based study in Olmsted County, Minnesota, in which individuals 
are examined approximately every 15 months.14 The data used in this study were collected 
from January 12, 2006, to January 9, 2014. All Olmsted County residents who were aged 70 
to 89 years on October 1, 2004, were identified using the Rochester Epidemiology Project 
medical records linkage system. Since then, we have reenumerated and resampled the 
population a number of times to maintain an active cohort of approximately 2800 
individuals without dementia. The study was approved by the Mayo Clinic and Olmsted 
Medical Center institutional review boards. All participants provided written informed 
consent.
Clinical Evaluations
At each visit, a study coordinator collected information regarding medical and family history 
and also interviewed a study partner about the individual to complete a modified Clinical 
Dementia Rating.15A physician then performed a medical history review, mental status 
examination, and neurologic examination. A comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation 
was performed that consisted of 9 tests from 4 cognitive domains: memory (Wechsler 
Memory Scale–Revised Logical Memory II [delayed recall], Wechsler Memory Scale–
Revised Visual Reproductions II [delayed recall], and the Auditory Verbal Learning Test 
[delayed recall]), attention-executive function (Trail Making Test Part B and Digit Symbol 
Substitution from the Wechsler Adult Intelligent Scale–Revised), language (Boston Naming 
Test and category fluency scores), and visuospatial skills (Block Design and Picture 
Completion tests from the Wechsler Adult Intelligent Scale–Revised).
Cognitive Impairment Determination
For the current study, we required individuals to be CN at baseline. To inform this 
determination, the raw scores from each test were transformed into age-adjusted scores 
using independent normative data from the Mayo’s Older Americans Normative Studies.16 
Domain scores were obtained by averaging the adjusted scaled scores within each domain 
and then scaled to allow for comparisons across domains. Individuals with domain scores at 
least 1 SD below the age-specific mean in the general population were considered for 
possible mild cognitive impairment (MCI). However, we emphasize that no algorithm was 
used to assign the diagnosis of MCI; rather, the study coordinator, neuropsychologist, and 
examining physician collectively assigned a diagnosis of MCI according to published 
criteria,17which included the following: (1) cognitive concern by the individual, informant, 
or physician; (2) impairment in one or more cognitive domains; (3) essentially normal 
functional activities; and (4) absence of dementia (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of 
Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition). As indicated above, individuals who were cognitively

 impaired at baseline were excluded. However, individuals who developed MCI or dementia 
during follow-up were not.
Continuous Measures of Cognitive Performance for Longitudinal Analysis
The age-normed scores discussed above were used only for clinical classifications. The 
continuous measures of cognitive performance used in the longitudinal analysis were not 
age normed. Instead, longitudinal global-and domain-specific z scores were calculated by 
first converting individual test scores to z scores. Domain-specific z scores were created by 
averaging the test-specific z scores, and a global z score was created by averaging the 
domain-specific z scores. The reference mean (SD) for all z scores was obtained from the 
2004 MCSA CN participants’ baseline performance.
Imaging Methods
A 3-dimensional, magnetization-prepared, rapid acquisition gradient-echo sequence was 
used to perform MRI at 3T. Images were corrected for distortion due to gradient nonlinearity 
and for bias field. Hippocampal volume was measured with Free-Surfer software, version 
5.3, which is documented and freely available for download online (http://
surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/). Total intracranial volume (TIV) was measured using an in-
house method. ATIV-adjusted hippocampal volume (HVa) measure was defined by 
calculating the residual from a linear regression of hippocampal volume vs TIV among 133 
CN individuals aged 30 to 59 years.18 This adjusted measure was used as a covariate in the 
models. Ventricular volume was measured with the boundary shift integral technique.19
Carbon 11–labeled Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) PET that consisted of four 5-minute 
dynamic frames was performed 40 to 60 minutes after injection.20 One hour after PiB PET, 
FDG-PET was performed. Individuals were injected with fluorodeoxyglucose 18–labeled 
FDG and imaged after 30 to 38 minutes for an 8-minute image acquisition that consisted of 
four 2-minute dynamic frames.
Quantitative image analysis for both PiB and FDG was performed using our in-house, fully 
automated image processing pipeline.20 A global, cortical, PiB PET standardized uptake 
value ratio (SUVR) was obtained by calculating the median uptake in the prefrontal, 
orbitofrontal, parietal, temporal, anterior cingulate, posterior cingulate, and precuneus 
regions for each study participant and dividing this result by the median uptake in the 
cerebellar gray matter. An FDG-PET SUVR was obtained in a similar manner. We used 
angular gyrus, posterior cingulate, and inferior temporal cortical regions to construct an AD-
signature meta region of interest, normalized to pons and vermis uptake.21
Inclusion Criteria
All MCSA participants were invited to undergo imaging. Participants included in this study 
had received MRI, FDG-PET, and PiB PET; were CN at the time of the first imaging visit; 
and had at least 1 clinical follow-up. A subset of individuals also had received serial 
imaging and were used in modeling changes in imaging measures over time.

 Statistical Analysis
The new criteria for MCI due to AD require the classification of biomarker and cognitive 
test results as normal or abnormal.22 Individuals were classified as having a normal PiB PET 
result (PiB−) or abnormal PiB PET result (PiB+) at baseline. We defined PiB+ as an SUVR 
greater than 1.5, a level at which individuals have clearly elevated amyloid levels on PET 
and that distinguishes between borderline cases, which is an approach consistent with the 
goals of typical clinical trials.
Because not all individuals underwent serial imaging, we compared baseline characteristics 
of those with vs without serial imaging using Wilcoxon rank sum and χ2 tests. The PiB+ 
individuals were compared with the PiB− individuals overall and in the serial imaging 
subset using Wilcoxon rank sum and χ2 tests. The subset of individuals without serial 
imaging are compared with those with serial imaging in Table 1, but longitudinal analyses 
that involved only this group were not performed. Linear regression was used to assess 
differences in baseline cognitive and imaging measures by PiB status after adjusting for age, 
sex, educational level, HVa, number of times the cognitive tests had been administered, and 
TIV where appropriate. Linear mixed-effects models with random subject specific intercepts 
and slopes were used to assess associations between PiB status at baseline and the 
longitudinal cognitive and imaging end points. All models included PiB status, time in years 
from baseline, and their interaction. To isolate the PiB effects and address possible 
confounding, we adjusted for age, sex, educational level, and number of times the cognitive 
tests had been administered by the baseline visit. Hippocampal and ventricular volume 
models were additionally adjusted for TIV. All models, except the hippocampal volume 
models, were also adjusted for HVa as a measure of neurodegeneration. Age and HVa 
interactions with time were included to allow rates of cognitive decline to vary by age and 
HVa. PiB and FDG models used log transformations of the response. Thus, coefficient 
estimates are interpreted as the approximate annual percent change in SUVR. In further 
modeling, we tested for interactions between APOE4 and PiB status. All individuals were 
included in the cognitive end point models, whereas the imaging end point models only 
included individuals with serial imaging data.
We fit a Cox proportional hazards regression model to assess the association between PiB 
status and progression to MCI or dementia. Age was used as the time scale using the start-
stop or period-at-risk formulation of the Cox proportional hazards model. The model 
included PiB status,APOE4 carrier status, and their interaction and was adjusted for 
educational level and HVa. The model was stratified by sex to allow for differing baseline 
hazards for men vs women. Time of MCI or dementia onset was defined as the midpoint 
between the last CN assessment and the first assessment with MCI or dementia. Individuals 
who did not progress during the available follow-up were censored at their last assessment. 
We also performed a sensitivity analysis using a parametric Weibull model to directly 
account for interval censoring and obtained results that were similar to the Cox proportional 
hazards regression model results.

 Results
Table 1 provides the baseline characteristics of all 564 CN individuals and contrasts those 
with (n = 286) vs without (n = 278) serial imaging. Compared with individuals with no 
serial imaging, individuals with serial imaging were more likely to be male and APOE4 
carriers. They also tended to have lower memory, attention, language, and global z scores at 
baseline, although these differences were quite modest.
Baseline Data
Table 2 provides the differences in individuals who were PiB+ and PiB− at baseline. In 
general, the PiB+ individuals were older, were more likely to test positive for APOE4, and 
had lower scores on global cognitive function and memory and language tests compared 
with the PiB− individuals. The PiB+ individuals tended to have lower scores on attention 
and visuospatial tests as well, but these differences were not statistically significant. The PiB
+ individuals had lower FDG ratios and smaller hippocampal volumes relative to the PiB− 
individuals. Similar patterns were seen among the subset of individuals with serial imaging 
studies.
Longitudinal Changes
Figure 1 shows the estimated mean annual change in cognitive function by PiB. The annual 
cognitive decline was greater for PiB+ individuals compared with PiB− individuals on all 
cognitive measures except language, after adjusting for age, sex, educational level, HVa, and 
number of times the cognitive tests had been administered. On average, the PiB+ individuals 
were declining approximately 0.1 z score units per year faster than PiB− individuals on the 
global measure and in the memory and attention domains. The difference was approximately 
half this amount in the language and visuospatial domains. On average, PiB+ individuals 
were declining approximately 0.2 points per year faster on the Short Test of Mental Status 
compared to PiB− individuals. Of note, these differences in rates of cognitive decline 
between PiB+ and PiB− individuals were of similar magnitude to the differences in rates of 
cognitive decline between an 80-year-old vs a 70-year-old person.
Figure 2 shows the estimated mean annual percent change in the PiB and FDG ratios, annual 
change in hippocampal volumes, and annual change in ventricular volumes by PiB status. 
The PiB+ individuals had a higher annual rate of PiB accumulation (by 1.6 percentage 
points), greater annual increase in ventricular volumes (by 565 mm3), and greater annual 
decrease in hippocampal volumes (by 30 mm3) compared with the PiB− individuals. Change 
in FDG was not significantly associated with PiB. Age was not independently associated 
with change in PiB (P = .82), hippocampal volume (P = .37), or ventricular volume (P = .
09), but older age was associated with greater declines in FDG (P = .03). eFigure 1 in the 
Supplement complements the summaries in Figure 1 and Figure 2 by showing the fitted 
regression lines for PiB+ and PiB− individuals.

 for PiB+ APOE4 carriers and noncarriers were similar, with both groups worsening more 
rapidly than their PiB− counterparts. Although APOE4 carrier status was generally 
associated with change in cognition when ignoring PiB status, after adjusting for PiB status, 
APOE4 was not independently associated with cognitive declines. However, we found 
APOE4 modified the rate of change for the PiB and hippocampal volume estimates. The rate 
of PiB accumulation was lower among PiB− APOE4 noncarriers compared with PiB− 
APOE4 carriers (P = .001), PiB+ APOE4 noncarriers (P < .001), and PiB+ APOE4 carriers 
(P < .001).We also found that hippocampal volume was declining less quickly in the PiB− 
APOE4 carrier group compared with PiB− APOE4 noncarriers (P= .02), PiB+ APOE4 
noncarriers (P = .008), and PiB+ APOE4 carriers (P < .001). eFigure 4 in the Supplement 
complements the summaries in eFigure 2 and eFigure 3 in the Supplement by showing the 
fitted regression lines for PiB+ and PiB− individuals by APOE4 status.
Progression to MCI or Dementia
During a median of 2.5 (interquartile range, 1.3–2.9) years of follow-up, 88 individuals 
progressed clinically to MCI or dementia (n = 84 to MCI and n = 4 to dementia). Baseline 
characteristics in individuals who developed MCI or dementia and in individuals who 
remained CN are given in the eTable in the Supplement. The hazard ratios (HRs) from the 
Cox proportional hazards regression models are summarized in Figure 3 for the 4 groups 
defined by PiB and APOE4 carrier status, with APOE4 noncarriers who were PiB− serving 
as the reference. After controlling for sex, educational level, and HVa, PiB+ individuals had 
a greater risk for progression to MCI or dementia, with the greatest risk in the PiB+ APOE4 
carriers (HR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.7–5.0) and a still-elevated risk among PiB+ APOE4 noncarriers 
(HR, 1.6; 95% CI, 0.9–2.8). This association between PiB and progression to MCI or 
dementia is consistent with the greater change in continuous measures seen among PiB+ 
individuals. However, an APOE4-PiB interaction was seen in the Cox proportional hazards 
regression model (P = .03), whereas this effect modification was not observed for the 
continuous cognitive outcomes.
Discussion
These data, using individuals selected from a population based cohort of CN people, shed 
light on the role of amyloid deposition as detected by PET. At baseline, CN individuals with 
clearly elevated levels of amyloid performed worse on most cognitive measures and 
measures of neurodegeneration even after accounting for potential confounders, including 
age, sex, educational level, and hippocampal volume (when applicable). The literature on 
this topic has been variable, with some studies finding no significant associations with 
amyloid and cognition cross-sectionally and others finding a significant effect.10,11,23–27 
Several of these studies were performed on relatively small populations, and the source of 
the participants was variable. Our data represent one of the first characterizations of 
individuals drawn from a population-based sample.
Over time, PiB+ individuals had greater declines in global- and domain-specific cognitive 
measures and higher rates of amyloid accumulation, hippocampal atrophy, and ventricular 
expansion compared with PiB− individuals. Given that we adjusted for key confounders,

 such as age, sex, educational level, and hippocampal volume (when applicable), we 
conclude that PiB is independently associated with cognitive decline, hippocampal atrophy, 
and ventricular expansion. Although differences between the PiB+ and PiB− individuals in 
terms of annual cognitive change were modest, the effect size generally corresponded to that 
of a 10-year difference in age. The PiB+ individuals were also more likely to progress 
clinically to MCI or dementia. As such, if these changes persisted on an annual basis, the 
effect would be quite noticeable.
The Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) study11 has also reported 
associations with amyloid and cognitive decline. Among 320 healthy older individuals, 
amyloid positive individuals (n = 76) had a greater decline in verbal and visual episodic 
memory during 36 months of follow-up compared with amyloid-negative individuals. 
However, unlike our current study, the AIBL study did not find differences in cognitive 
decline in nonmemory domains by amyloid status.
The literature is mixed in regard to the association between amyloid and APOE genotype in 
predicting cognitive decline. The AIBL study was enriched for APOE4 carriers and found 
similar rates of cognitive decline in amyloid-positive APOE4 carriers and noncarriers. Lim 
et al,28 who specifically examined amyloid and APOE effects, suggested that amyloid 
effects on cognitive decline were greater than APOE effects. However, a subsequent AIBL 
report29 that focused on 84amyloid-positive individuals found faster rates of decline on 
memory for the APOE4 carriers. In a recent report30 that combined data from 3 
observational convenience cohorts (n = 490), CN individuals who were both amyloid 
positive and APOE4 carriers had a greater decline in Logical Memory Delayed Recall and 
Mini-Mental State Examination scores compared with all other groups defined by amyloid 
and APOE4. Of interest, the PiB− individuals and PiB+ noncarriers had a slight 
improvement during the median follow-up of 1.5 years.
In our data while ignoring PiB altogether, APOE4 carrier status was generally associated 
with greater changes in the continuous cognitive measures over time. With both PiB status 
and APOE4 as predictors, PiB was predictive but APOE4 was not predictive of decline. 
Therefore, the effect of APOE4 is largely mediated by amyloid positivity. We also found 
that PiB+ APOE4 carriers and noncarriers had similar rates of longitudinal cognitive decline. 
Although our data cannot be used to rule out faster declines among PiB+ APOE4 carriers vs 
noncarriers, noncarriers with high levels of amyloid are also likely to experience cognitive 
declines.
We observed evidence of an increased hazard for amyloid-positive APOE4 carriers and 
noncarriers alike. Still, the association of PiB and progression to MCI or dementia was 
appreciably stronger in the APOE4 carriers. The AIBL investigators have also reported that 
PiB+ CN individuals were more likely to progress clinically to MCI or dementia during 36 
months of follow-up (odds ratio,4.8;95% CI, 1.9–12).31 The increased odds held for 
noncarriers and carriers, although the latter group was at higher risk.
One potentially conflicting result from our study was that PiB+ APOE4 carriers progressed 
clinically to MCI or dementia at a higher rate than that of noncarriers even though their rates

 of cognitive change were similar. This finding can largely be explained by differences at 
baseline. As shown in eFigure 4 in the Supplement, by having worse baseline performance 
but similar rates of change, the PiB+ APOE4 carriers tended to have lower cognition than 
the PiB+ noncarriers throughout all follow-up and thus were at an increased risk of MCI 
compared with PiB+ noncarriers.
Conclusions
Our data reveal that the presence of elevated levels of amyloid is associated with cognitive 
and neurodegenerative marker changes over time. The evidence of neurodegenerative 
abnormalities depicted by MRI and FDG-PET at baseline imply that these changes had 
begun, but do not speak to the temporal ordering of the changes. Recent data indicate that 
individuals who are amyloid negative but neurodegeneration positive can also have an AD 
signature.32–34
The implications of these results for the design of randomized clinical trials are evident. 
Individuals with clearly elevated levels of amyloid appear to be predisposed to progress 
clinically and on measures of neurodegeneration and can serve as a source of enrichment for 
clinical trials, and additional evidence of neurodegeneration may not be necessary.
