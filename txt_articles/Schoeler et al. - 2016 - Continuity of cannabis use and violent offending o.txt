Although the association between cannabis use and violence has been reported in the 
literature, the precise nature of this relationship, especially the directionality of this 
association is unclear. 
Method 
Young males from the Cambridge Study of Delinquent Development (CSDD) (N=411) were 
followed up between ages 8 and 56 years to prospectively investigate the association between 
cannabis use and violence. A multi-wave (eight assessments, T1-T8) follow-up design was 
employed that allowed temporal sequencing of the variables of interest and the analysis of 
violent outcome measures obtained from two sources, (i) criminal records (violent conviction, 
VC) and (ii) self-reports (SR-V). A combination of analytic approaches allowing inferences 
as to the directionality of associations was employed, including multivariate logistic 
regression analysis, fixed effects analysis and cross-lagged modeling. 
Results 
Multivariable logistic regression revealed that compared to never users, continued exposure to 
cannabis (use at age 18, 32 and 48) was associated with a higher risk of subsequent violent 
behaviour, as indexed by convictions (OR=7.1[95% CI: 2.19 - 23.59]) or self-reports 
(OR=8.9[95% CI: 2.37 - 46.21]). This effect persisted after controlling for other putative risk 
factors for violence. In predicting violence, fixed effects analysis and cross-lagged modeling 
further indicated that this effect could not be explained by other unobserved time invariant 
factors. Furthermore, these analyses uncovered bi-directional relationship between cannabis 
use and violence. 
Conclusions 
Together, these results provide strong indication that cannabis use predicts subsequent violent 
offending, suggesting a possible causal effect and provide empirical evidence that may have 
implications for public policy

1. Introduction 
Cannabis is the most widely used illicit drug in most parts of the world (UNDOC 2010), with 
onset of use often during the developmentally critical period of adolescence and persisting 
through early adulthood  (Patton et al. 2007). Among the many potential aversive 
consequences of cannabis use on cognitive, behavioural and mental health outcomes 
(Bhattacharyya et al. 2012a, Bhattacharyya et al. 2012b, Bhattacharyya et al. 2009, Lindsay et 
al. 2005, Peters et al. 2014, Schoeler and Bhattacharyya 2013, Schoeler et al. 2015, Schoeler 
et al. in press), previous research has shown that violent behavior (Johnson et al. 1991, 
Monshouwer et al. 2006, Nabors 2010, Peters et al. 2014) or delinquency and aggression in 
adolescence (Chabrol and Saint-Martin 2009, Fergusson et al. 2002, Monshouwer et al. 2006) 
may result from cannabis use. Pharmacologically, cannabis may cause impairments in 
response inhibition resulting in behavioural control in vulnerable individuals, that may 
underlie impulsive, violent behaviour, by altering the normal functioning of its underlying 
neural substrate, the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex in man (Bhattacharyya et al. 2015, 
Bhattacharyya et al. 2014). Existing observational evidence in this area, mostly cross-
sectional, constrains the possibility of drawing causal inferences. Longitudinal evidence in 
this regard has been limited as well (Brook et al. 2003, Brook et al. 2014, Friedman et al. 
1996, Pedersen and Skardhamar 2010), mainly lacking in serial assessments over time and 
having relatively short follow-up periods [e.g. no study has followed up beyond 15 years (cf. 
Table 1.)]. Effect of risk factors such as antisocial personality, alcohol or other illicit drug use 
or family history of criminality (Farrington 2000, Jennings et al. 2012, Theobald and 
Farrington 2012) have also not always been considered (McNaughton Reyes et al. 2014, 
Norström and Rossow 2014, White and Hansell 1998). Preliminary evidence suggests a dose-
 4 
 
response relationship between cannabis use and violence/delinquency (Brook et al. 2014, 
Norström and Rossow 2014, Reingle et al. 2012), though the evidence is limited from similar 
shortcomings as highlighted above. All (Brook et al. 2003, Brook et al. 2014, Chabrol and 
Saint-Martin 2009, Fergusson et al. 2002, Friedman et al. 1996, Johnson et al. 1991, 
Monshouwer et al. 2006, Nabors 2010, Norström and Rossow 2014, Peters et al. 2014, 
Reingle et al. 2012, Resnick et al. 2004, White and Hansell 1998), but one (Pedersen and 
Skardhamar 2010) of the studies based on longitudinal general population samples assessing 
criminal behaviour have relied on self-reports of violence. Self-reports may be susceptible to 
bias such as testing effects, developmental changes or under-reporting of violent behaviour 
(Lauritsen 1998, Piquero et al. 2014). The only study that collected data from crime registers 
did not find that cannabis was a significant predictor (Pedersen and Skardhamar 2010), which 
may suggest either a true null finding or reflect the problem of underreporting of less serious 
crimes in record data considering that not all acts of violence need to be criminal in nature 
(Blumstein 1986, Pepper and Petrie 2003). Underreporting of violence in official records may 
also arise as a result of failure of the criminal justice system to detect and record all offenders 
as well as bias in arrest processes. While neither self-report nor official records provide an 
accurate account of the true rate of crime, they are the methods of choice for obtaining 
longitudinal data on individual violent careers and it has been suggested that both methods 
may be employed in concert to overcome some of the limitations of each (Blumstein 1986). 
Furthermore, less is known regarding the directionality of the association between cannabis 
use and violence, an issue that deserves careful consideration since reverse causation may 
explain the association. For instance, impulsiveness/disinhibition or conduct problems evident 
in childhood have also been linked to subsequent use/ abuse of cannabis (Brook et al. 2013, 
 5 
 
Pingault et al. 2013, von Sydow et al. 2002) and other studies in adolescents and young adults 
have reported a reciprocal relationship between substance use and violence (Scholes-Balog et 
al. 2013, Xue et al. 2009). 
In the present study, we have attempted to address the limitations outlined above by 
employing multi-wave, prospective assessment of a population-based cohort of all school-
aged male children from a defined geographical area in London, and included violence data 
based on both self-report and criminal records to establish the precise nature of the 
relationship between cannabis use and violent behaviour. They have been followed up over 
nearly half a century to assess the effect of exposure to cannabis at different stages of life on 
violent behaviour, as indexed using two independent measures, recorded violent convictions 
and self-reports. We examined whether ‘continued use’ is the critical determinant that 
underpins the association between cannabis use and violence after controlling for potential 
confounding factors such as family history of criminality, childhood antisocial behaviour, 
mental health history, alcohol and other illicit drug use (Bennett et al. 2008, Farrington 1995, 
Resnick et al. 2004).

2. Methods 
2.1 Study sample 
The Cambridge Study in Delinquent Development (CSDD), originally designed by Donald J. 
West and directed since 1982 by David P. Farrington, is a prospective longitudinal study of 
the development of offending and antisocial behaviour in a cohort of 411 boys born mostly in 
1953 and living in a homogenous, working-class urban area of London (Farrington 1995, 
 6 
 
West and Farrington 1973). They represented the complete population of boys who were 8 
years old at that time (1961/62) and were attending one of six primary schools in a deprived 
area in London. Multiple waves (T1- T8) of data collection, which included participant 
interviews [at ages 8 (T1), 10 (T2), 14 (T3), 16 (T4), 18 (T5), 21 (T6), 32 (T7) and 48 (T8)] 
complemented information obtained from parents (annually) and teachers (bi-annually) 
between age 8-15 years. 97% of the sample was white and all were raised in two-parent 
working class households (Farrington 1995). A detailed description of the methods is 
included as supplementary material (cf. sAppendix 1. Supplementary Material). 
2.2 Measures 
Violent conviction (VC): Criminal records 
Conviction information was obtained for every year from age 10-56 through searches at the 
central Criminal Record Office in London or from countries where they had emigrated to. VC 
was defined as conviction for robbery, assault, threatening behaviour, or possessing an 
offensive weapon. We estimated two separate dependent variables (DV). For cannabis users, 
only convictions that were committed subsequent to cannabis use were considered:  
a. DV1VC [cumulative number of subsequent VCs] was computed by calculating the 
cumulative mean number/year from age 10-56.  
b. DV2VC [risk of subsequent VC] was coded as a dichotomized variable, “yes” if at least 
one conviction was committed between age 10-56.  
Self-reported violence (SR-V) 
SR-V was measured based on report of the person’s involvement in assaults, fights, and use 
of a weapon in physical fights and estimated as two DVs as for violent convictions. 
 7 
 
a. DV1SR-V [cumulative number of subsequent SR-V]:  SR-V (yes/no) was available at 
three different time points: T5, T7 and T8, based on information on violence between 
age ranges 15-18, 27-32 and 43-48 respectively.  
b. DV2SR-V [risk of subsequent SR-V] was a dichotomized variable, coded as “yes” if a 
subject admitted to violence at T5, T7 or T8.  
Cannabis use (Independent variable, IV) 
Cannabis use during the preceding five years was assessed at ages 14 (T3), 16 (T4), 18 (T5), 
32 (T7), and 48 (T8) years. For the purposes of this investigation, we focused on cannabis use 
at T5, T7 and T8, as very few individuals had reported cannabis use at T4 or earlier (cf. 
sAppendix 2., Supplementary Material). 
a. IV 1 (Ever cannabis use) was coded as “yes” if a subject was classified as a cannabis 
user in at least one of the assessments. 
b. IV 2 (Continuity of cannabis use) was computed as an ordinal variable based on 
cannabis use: (1) never cannabis user, (2) cannabis user at 1 time point only (e.g., at 
T5 only but not T7 or T8), (3) cannabis user at 2 time points (e.g., cannabis use at T5 
and T7 but not T8), or (3) cannabis user at all 3 time points. 
Covariates 
The covariates included in the analysis were chosen based on previous research, reporting a 
link between violence and antisocial behaviour (Farrington 2000), mental illness (Brennan et 
al. 2000) and substance use, including alcohol, illicit drugs and nicotine (Bennett et al. 2008, 
Jennings et al. 2012):  
 8 
 
a. Antisocial traits were assessed at age ten based on teacher, peer, or parent ratings1 
using the antisocial personality scale (AP) (Farrington 1991).  
b. Alcohol abuse defined as presence of binge drinking (>13 units per evening in the last 
month yes/no) was assessed at T5, T7, and T8 and a continuous variable was 
computed based on whether binge-drinking was present or not at the 1-3 time-points 
assessed (score ranging from 0-3)  
c. Other drug use (yes/no) assessed at T7 was coded as “yes” if the person had tried 
drugs other than cannabis. 
d. Cigarette use defined as presence of smoking (> £2 spent on cigarettes per week/ over 
20 cigarettes/ day) was assessed at T5 and T7 and T8 and a score (from 0 to 3) was 
computed based on whether smoking was present or not at the 1-3 time points 
assessed (scoring from 0 - 3). 
e. Diagnosis of mental illness (yes/no) was assessed using the Structured Clinical 
Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders (SCID) (First et al. 1998) as part of a 
psychiatric interview at T8. Subjects were classified as those with or without a 
lifetime diagnosis of a mental disorder by age 48. 
 
Childhood risk factors 
Based on previous literature (Theobald and Farrington 2012, West and Farrington 1973), 
essential childhood risk factors that may independently contribute to both violence and drug 
use were included in these analyses: 
 
1 
 For the present analyses, each variable was dichotomized, as far as possible, into the “worst” quarter 
of males  versus the remainder, with those most at risk coded as 2 and the remainder as 1 
 9 
 
a. Social class was coded as “low” if the family breadwinner had an unskilled manual 
job. 
b. Family history (presence of delinquent sibling and/or criminal parent) was measured 
up to the boy’s tenth birthday.  
2.3 Analysis  
Data was analysed using R (R Core Team 2015) comprising four main statistical approaches:  
(1) Kruskal-Wallis test was followed by Bonferroni correction for multiple testing to 
make comparisons among the four different cannabis trajectory groups (never use vs. 
use at one, two or three time points) on the average number of total violent 
convictions committed by age 56/ average number of self-reported violence by age 48.  
(2) Univariate logistic regression analysis was employed to estimate the effect of cannabis 
use and other potential risk factors on violence. Subsequently, we carried out 
multivariate logistic regression analyses to examine the relationship between cannabis 
use and violence, while accounting for the covariates retained from the initial bivariate 
models (all factors with p<0.10 were included).  
(3) Fixed-effects logistic regression models were fitted in order to extend the ordinary 
logistic regression by adjusting for time invariant non-observed fixed factors that vary 
across individuals, such as family background, genetic influences, personality or pre-
existing violent traits. In order to minimize the influence of reverse causation we (i) 
implemented fixed-effects models that used lagged outcome, i.e. examined whether 
changes in cannabis use were associated with subsequent changes in violence and (ii) 
tested a competing reverse causation model in which we tested the effect of changes in 
violence on changes in cannabis use. Alcohol use and cigarette use were included as 
 10 
 
time-dynamic covariates in the models (for details see sAppendix 3., Supplementary 
Material). 
(4) Finally, structural equation modeling was employed, in which cross-lagged reciprocal 
causal pathway models were fitted to examine the longitudinal bi-directional paths 
between cannabis and violence, while controlling for time-dynamic factors including 
alcohol and cigarette use (assessed at age 18, 32 and 48) and time-invariant factors 
including antisocial personality measured at age 10. Model goodness of fit was 
assessed on the basis of a number of fit indices described in sAppendix 4. 
(Supplementary Material). 
3. Results 
3.1 Follow up characteristics 
Out of the 411 boys assessed at baseline, complete multi-wave cannabis and violence data 
(T1-T8) at follow up 48 years later was available for a total number of N=340 for SR-V and 
N=339 for VC (for follow up flow chart see sFigure 1., Supplementary Material). Missing 
data on alcohol use (n=1), cigarette use (n=6) and family history of crime (n=2) slightly 
reduced the number of subjects in the multivariate regression models (cf. Table 3 below). 
Comparing subjects without complete data who were not included in the univariate analyses 
(n=71) to those with complete data (n=340) revealed that there were no significant differences 
between the two groups in predictor variables and violence, except for self-reported violence 
at age 18. This was less likely to have been reported (p=.04) in those who subsequently 
dropped out (cf. sTable1, Supplementary Material). Sixteen percent of the sample (n=55/339) 
had at least one registered violent conviction between age 10-56, while 49% (n=165/340) 
reported a violent act at least once over follow-up. Thirty-eight percent (n=130/340) of this 
 11 
 
sample had used cannabis at least once in their life, of whom a large proportion (39%) had 
used cannabis in their teens only and then stopped (Figure 1), while 20% of those who started 
it by age 18 reported using it at age 32 and 48.  
Figure 1. 
 
The highest proportion of the sample was found to have never been violent and never used 
cannabis (VC- 56%, SR-V- 37%; sTable 2.). Over a fifth reported violent behaviour 
following cannabis use (SR-V- 22%), while a lower proportion were convicted following 
cannabis use (VC- 7%). This was substantially higher than the proportion of subjects in whom 
violence preceded cannabis use but did not continue subsequently (VC- 1.2%, SR-V-0.3%) or 
those subjects in whom violence preceded and also followed cannabis use (VC- 2.1%, SR-V- 
1.2%).  
3.2 Continued cannabis use and number of violent convictions  
Results from the Kruskal-Wallis test indicated that there was a significant effect of cannabis 
use trajectory on total number of VCs by age 56 (p<0.001) and total number of SR-V by age 
48 (p<0.001) (Figure 2a. and Figure 2b.). Pairwise post-hoc testing showed that continued 
cannabis use was associated with significantly more violent convictions by age 56 compared 
to never users or those who used it only at one or two time-points throughout follow up 
(Table 2). There was a similar effect on self-reported violence.  
 
Figure 2a and 2b and Table 2. 
 
3.3 Continued cannabis use and risk of subsequent violence  
 12 
 
Univariate logistic regression analysis revealed that those who used cannabis at least once in 
their life had an increased risk for a subsequent violent conviction (OR=2.58[95% CI 1.41-
4.73]) and self-reported violence (OR= 2.35[95% CI 1.50-3.68]), but this effect disappeared 
when controlled for confounders in multivariate analysis (sTable 3.). When cannabis use was 
categorized, only continued cannabis use (as indexed by use at all three time-points assessed 
over the follow-up period) remained a significant predictor, implicating a dose-dependent 
effect (cf. Table 3. below). Continued cannabis use, remained the strongest predictor for 
subsequent VC (OR = 7.08[95% CI 2.19-23.59]) and SR-V (OR = 8.94[95% CI 2.37-46.21]).  
The only other factor that had a significant effect on both VC and SR-V in the multivariate 
model was antisocial personality (OR = 3.43[95% CI 1.59 - 7.52] for VC and (OR = 
2.15[95% CI 1.19 - 3.91] for SR-V). Family history of crime was only predictive of VC (2.51 
[95% CI 1.22 - 5.22] and alcohol (OR=1.65[95% CI 1.21 - 2.27] and nicotine use (OR = 
1.40[95% CI 1.10 - 1.79]) was associated with SR-V but not VC.  
Table 3. 
 
3.4 Directionality of the association between cannabis and violence 
The results from the cross-lagged fixed-effects models suggest that change in cannabis use 
over time increases the Odds by 1.18[95% CI 1.09-1.28] for subsequent SR-V and by 1.08 
[95% CI 1.02-1.14] for subsequent VC (cf. sTable 5., Supplementary Material), while 
controlling for factors that may vary over time, including cigarette and alcohol use. The cross-
lagged fixed-effects models testing for reverse directionality showed that self-reported 
violence was a significant predictor for subsequent changes in cannabis use SR-V (1.06[95% 
 13 
 
CI 1.00-1.12]); however, a similar effect was not observed for recorded violent convictions 
(VC) (1.01[95% CI 0.92-1.12]). 
The results from structural equation modeling indicate evidence of statistically significant 
reciprocal relationships between cannabis use and violence, such that (1) cannabis use 
predicts subsequent VC (0.205[95% CI 0.026-0.385]) and SR-V (0.190[95% CI 0.065-0.314]) 
and (2) violence in turn also predicts subsequent cannabis use (0.191[95% CI 0.026-0.356] 
for VC and 0.215[95% CI 0.065-0.366] for SR-V). The fit indices for the reciprocal 
directionality models from the structural equation analysis are displayed in sTable 6. 
(Supplementary Material). When exploring the unconstrained path estimates for the different 
time points, the results indicated that the nature of the association differed depending on the 
developmental stage: reciprocal associations were present in early adulthood [cannabis use at 
age 18 as a predictor for subsequent VC (0.240[95%CI 0.001-0.479]) and SR-V 
(0.153[95%CI -0.024-0.329]); violence at age 18 as a predictor for subsequent cannabis use 
(0.265[95%CI 0.055-0.476] for VC and 0.324[95%CI 0.118-0.530] for SR-V). Significant 
effects of cannabis on violence were present in late adulthood for SR-V [cannabis at age 32 as 
a predictor for subsequent SR-V (0.212[95% CI 0.010-0.414])] but not vice versa [SR-V at 32 
not a predictor for cannabis use at 48 (0.083[95%CI -0.100-0.266]). No significant 
associations (p>0.25) were found in late adulthood using the structural equation modeling (cf. 
sFigure2. and sTable5., Supplementary Material). 
4. Discussion 
In the present study, we set out to examine the nature of the association between cannabis use 
and violent behaviour and the determinants of that relationship. Using data from half a 
century follow-up of a prospectively recruited cohort from a defined geographical area, we 
 14 
 
find that exposure to cannabis is associated with an increased risk for subsequent 
criminal/violent activity across the life span from childhood through to middle age, that is 
independent to and persists even after controlling for other measured putative risk factors and 
unobserved time-invariant factors of confounding. Furthermore, we show that the adverse 
effect of cannabis use on subsequent violent behaviour is driven by continued use of the 
substance, as indexed by use endorsed at multiple time-points. Stronger association between 
violence and use of cannabis endorsed at several time-points spread over a substantial portion 
of lifetime suggest a dose-response relationship between cannabis use and violence, consistent 
with previous literature (Brook et al. 2014, Monshouwer et al. 2006, Reingle et al. 2012). We 
also establish that this relationship is not only true for self-reports of violent behaviour, as in 
the previous studies (Brook et al. 2003, Brook et al. 2014, Fergusson et al. 2002, Johnson et 
al. 1991, McNaughton Reyes et al. 2014, Monshouwer et al. 2006, Nabors 2010, Norström 
and Rossow 2014, Peters et al. 2014, Reingle et al. 2012, Resnick et al. 2004), but go beyond 
existing evidence by demonstrating for the first time that continued cannabis use is associated 
with a 7-fold greater odds for subsequent violent convictions, a robust outcome measure that 
is not vulnerable to some of the methodological weaknesses of self-reported violence. To put 
this in perspective, the size of this effect is comparable to the effect of continued nicotine use 
over similar duration (40 years) on the risk of lung cancer in the UK (OR 8.3 [95% CI 2.3-
29.7]) (Crispo et al. 2004).  
Together, these results imply a reciprocal relationship between cannabis use and violence, 
which is consistent with a number of studies that reported such a relationship between 
substance use and violence in adolescence and emerging adulthood (Scholes-Balog et al. 
2013, Xue et al. 2009) as well as studies that suggest a link between 
 15 
 
impulsiveness/disinhibition or conduct problems evident in childhood and subsequent use/ 
abuse of cannabis (Brook et al. 2013, Pingault et al. 2013, von Sydow et al. 2002), alcohol 
(Caspi et al. 1996) or illicit drugs (Fergusson et al. 2008). Our results tend to suggest that 
these reciprocal effects are only dominant in early adulthood and violence in later life is not 
associated with subsequent cannabis use, although cannabis use at later age remained a 
significant predictor for self-reported violence. However, it is worth noting that this may also 
reflect lack of adequate power to detect such effects in the present sample, as both outcomes 
become less common in later life. No association was found for violent conviction at later 
age, which may indicate that cannabis use is a stronger predictor for less serious violent acts 
rather than those that may lead to conviction. The results add to previous investigations on 
reciprocal relationships reporting that cannabis use but not violence remained a consistent 
predictor over time (Wei et al. 2004). It has also been reported that the strength of association 
between crime and cannabis varies across different developmental stages in adolescence, with 
younger users being more affected than older users (Fergusson et al. 2002), again suggesting 
that a range of associated psychosocial risk factors evident in younger cannabis users may 
increase its effect on violence. Together, the results of the present study speak to several of 
the criteria (specificity, temporality, biological gradient and strength) commonly considered 
to ascertain whether an association is causal in nature (Hill 1965). Although the findings 
indicate pharmacological effects of cannabis on violence, the relatively long lag between the 
measurement time points (>12 years in SEM models) do not allow one to draw conclusions 
regarding acute or non-acute pharmacological effects. Nevertheless, the findings are 
consistent with independent experimental evidence that a single dose of cannabis can cause 
impairments in behavioural control, that may underlie impulsive, violent behaviour, by 
 16 
 
altering the normal functioning of its underlying neural substrate, the ventrolateral prefrontal 
cortex in man (Bhattacharyya et al. 2014). These results are not only consistent with previous 
evidence as highlighted earlier, but also internally consistent, as we show that the relationship 
exists for two separate but related and complementary outcome measures obtained from 
independent sources, one based on official records and another on self-report from 
participants.  
By using fixed-effects models and taking into consideration potential confounders in risk 
prediction models, we have tried to account for both measured and unmeasured time-invariant 
factors (such as genetic or temperamental traits by considering antisocial personality traits 
assessed at age ten; parental modeling by considering family history of crime; social class 
etc.) and factors that change over time (e.g. alcohol binge drinking, cigarette use other illicit 
drug use). Taking these factors into consideration is crucial as they may potentially confound 
the association between cannabis use and subsequent violence (Norström and Rossow 2014).  
It is worth noting that despite the range of putative predictors tested here, continued cannabis 
use remained the most significant predictor in the ordinary multivariate regression analysis 
and together with antisocial personality traits was consistently associated with both measures 
of subsequent violent behaviour. The results further indicate that the effect of continued 
cannabis use is not confounded by antisocial personality traits present at the age of ten, 
another important predictor, albeit with an weaker association (with odds of 3.4 for risk of 
conviction and odds of 2.2 for risk of self-reported violence). This is in line with previous 
research showing that cannabis remains an independent predictor after controlling for early 
conduct problems (Pedersen and Skardhamar 2010). Antisocial personality traits appear to be 
a stronger predictor for conviction than for self-reported violence, consistent with previous 
 17 
 
research using data from both self-reports and criminal convictions (Moffitt et al. 2002), 
perhaps indicating that antisocial traits are more likely to be associated with more severe 
offences (Farrington 1995).  
From a public health point of view, these results are particularly relevant in that they show 
longitudinal effects of persistent cannabis use on violence. More specifically, they suggest 
that intervention programs in early adulthood are likely to be most beneficial if they target 
both cannabis use and violent behaviour in light of their reciprocal relationship, and provide 
an empirical basis for consideration of the consequences of cannabis use in middle age. It is 
worth noting a few caveats in interpreting the results of this study.  Firstly, we did not 
investigate the effects of cannabis use parameters such as frequency of use or type of cannabis 
used, which have been shown to moderate the effects of cannabis on violence (Chabrol and 
Saint-Martin 2009, Fergusson et al. 2002, Friedman et al. 1996, Monshouwer et al. 2006, 
Norström and Rossow 2014, Pedersen and Skardhamar 2010, White and Hansell 1998). 
Hence, it may be argued that self-report data of cannabis use as available in this study are 
imprecise and do not easily demonstrate a dose-response association given the binary (yes/ 
no) measure of cannabis exposure used in this analysis. Nevertheless, we were able to detect a 
strong association with violent outcomes that persisted after controlling for putative risk 
factors. An imprecise estimation of the predictor variable is only likely to have diluted its 
effect on the outcome variable. However, this is unlikely to have influenced the direction of 
the results reported herein as the effect of cannabis use on violent outcomes that we report 
here is unlikely to have been overestimated. On the contrary, the true effect of cannabis use 
on violent outcomes is perhaps greater than that we observe here. Furthermore, an intuitive 
approach to examining dose-response relationship in the context of cannabis use has involved 
 18 
 
taking into account frequency / number of cannabis joints smoked (Fergusson et al. 2002). 
Instead, results presented here show that use of cannabis spread over a longer period of an 
individual’s life has a greater effect on violent outcome than use spread over a shorter 
duration. Persistent cannabis use as in the present study is likely to indicate more frequent use 
(Schulenberg et al. 2005, Windle and Wiesner 2004). Our results are therefore consistent with 
studies showing a dose-response relationship between cannabis use and violence. In this 
context, it is worth mentioning that self-reported cannabis use and violence from age 18 
onwards as reported in this cohort do not reflect lifetime use data but use over the 5-years 
preceding the follow-up time-point under consideration.  
Secondly, the study sample comprised only male subjects, thus not generalizable to females. 
This aspect of study design was beyond the control of the present investigators, as the cohort 
was initiated over half a century ago. Nevertheless, given that the association between 
cannabis use and violence seems to be more prominent in males than females (Friedman et al. 
1996, Nabors 2010, Pedersen and Skardhamar 2010), this study addresses the relationship in 
the segment of the population where perhaps this may be most relevant. Notwithstanding 
these limitations, the present study substantially extends the current literature in a number of 
ways. Most previous studies were cross-sectional or prospectively investigated outcome over 
relatively short follow-up periods (Farrington 2010). In contrast, in the present study we were 
able to investigate prospectively collected data on cannabis use, violent outcome and 
confounding factors. We used information from multiple time-points from statutory, and 
multiple non-statutory sources, over nearly 50 years of longitudinal follow-up in a sample of 
all young males of a certain age from a defined catchment area. Furthermore, this 
methodology enabled us to accurately estimate temporal sequencing of the independent and 
 19 
 
dependent variables of interest that has not been possible in previous studies. Although we 
cannot conclude formally regarding the causal effects of cannabis on violence as the present 
study is observational, our methodology enabled us to accurately estimate temporal 
sequencing of the independent and dependent variables of interest that has not been possible 
in previous studies. Methodology as adopted here is considered only second best to evidence 
from randomized controlled trials in the context of investigation of causal relationships 
(Murray et al. 2009). Together, the results of the present study provide support for a causal 
relationship between exposure to cannabis and subsequent violent outcomes across a major 
part of life-span.

sAppendix 1. Study sample 
The Cambridge Study of Delinquent Development (CSDD), originally designed by Donald J. West and directed 
since 1982 by David P. Farrington, is a prospective longitudinal study of the development of offending and 
antisocial behavior in a cohort of 411 boys born mostly in 1953 living in homogenous, working class urban area 
of South London [a review of major findings may be found in several books (West and Farrington 1977, West 
and Farrington 1973, West 1982, West 1969, Piquero et al. 2007, Farrington et al. 2013) as well as in several in 
summary papers (Farrington et al. 2006, Farrington 1995, Farrington and West 1990)]. The men represented the 
complete population of boys who were 8 years of age at that time (1961/62) and were attending one of six 
primary schools in a deprived area in South London. There were multiple waves (T1- T8) of data collection 
which included participants being interviewed in their school [at ages 8 (T1), 10 (T2), and 14 (T3)], in research 
offices (at ages of 16 (T4), 18 (T5), and 21 (T6)] or in their homes (at ages 32 (T7) and 48 (T8)] by social 
science graduates. Parents were interviewed (about once per year) and questionnaires were completed by the 
boys’ teachers (about once every two years) between ages 8 and 15 to complement information about 
troublesome/aggressive behavior in school and difficulties at home. 97% of the sample was white and all were 
raised in two-parent working class household (Farrington 1995).  
 
sAppendix 2. Measures 
Violent conviction: Criminal records 
Conviction information was obtained for every follow-up year from age 10 to age 56 through searches at the 
central Criminal Record Office in London, a central repository containing records of all relatively serious 
offenses committed in Great Britain or Ireland, as well as minor juvenile offenses committed in the London area. 
‘Violent conviction’ (VC) was defined as conviction for robbery, assault, threatening behavior, or possessing an 
offensive weapon. In the case of 18 males who had emigrated outside Great Britain and Ireland by age 32, 
applications were made to search their criminal records in the 8 countries where they had settled, and searches 
were carried out in five countries. We estimated 2 separate dependent variables (Seillier et al. 2010):  
a. 
DV1VC [cumulative number of (subsequent) VCs]: The variable was computed by calculating the 
cumulative mean number per year from age 10 to 56. For cannabis users, only convictions that were 
committed subsequent to cannabis use were counted, excluding those that happened prior to use. 
b. DV2VC [risk of (subsequent) VC): This dichotomized dependent variable was coded as “yes” if at least 
one conviction was committed between age 10 and 56. For cannabis users, only convictions that were 
committed subsequent to cannabis use were counted.  
 
Self-reported violence 
Self-reported violence (SR-V) was measured based on report of the person’s involvement in assaults, fights, and 
use of a weapon in physical fights and also included two DVs as for violent convictions. 
a. 
DV1SR-V [cumulative number of (subsequent) SR-V]:  Data on violence (yes/no) was collected at three 
different time points, including T5: age 18 (violence between 15 and 18); T7: age 32 (involvement in 
fights between 27 and 32); and T8: age 48 (involvement in fights between 43 and 48).  
b. DV2SR-V [risk of (subsequent) SR-V]: This dichotomized dependent variable was coded as “yes” if a 
subject admitted to violence at either T5, T7 or T8. Cannabis use was considered to have preceded SR-
V if its use was reported either at the same or a time-point prior to the time-point under consideration 
for assessment of SR-V.  
 
Cannabis use (Independent variable, IV) 
At each face-to-face data collection, i.e. at ages 14 (T3), 16 (T4), 18 (T5), 32 (T7), and 48 (T8) years, the 
respondents were asked about their use of cannabis during the preceding 5 years.  
a. 
IV 1 (Ever cannabis use): Three dichotomized cannabis variables were computed, including (1) 
cannabis at T5 or before (yes/no if cannabis has been used at age 18 or before); (2) cannabis at T7 
(yes/no if cannabis has been used at least once between the age 27 and 32); and (3) cannabis at T8 
(yes/no if cannabis has been used at least once between the age 43 and 48). IV 1 was coded as “yes” if a 
subject was classified as a cannabis user in at least one of the three variables. No separate cannabis use 
variables were computed for T3 and T4 as very few individuals (n=2 and n=25 respectively) reported 
use at these assessment points, which were therefore all considered together while estimating use at the 
T5 assessment (cannabis at 18 or before). 
b. IV 2 (Continuity of cannabis use): An ordinal independent variable was computed based on three 
cannabis variables, classifying subjects either as (1) never cannabis user, (2) cannabis user at 1 time 
 3 
 
point only (e.g., at T5 only but not T7 or T8), (3) cannabis user at 2 time points (e.g., cannabis use at T5 
and T7 but not T8), or (3) cannabis user at all 3 time points. 
 
Covariates 
a. Antisocial traits were assessed at age 10 based on teachers, peers, or parents ratings1 using the antisocial 
personality scale (AP) as described in detail by (Farrington 1991)and included: troublesomeness, 
conduct problems, difficult to discipline, dishonest, has stolen, gets angry, daring, lacks 
concentration/restlessness, impulsive, and truants.  
b. Alcohol use defined as presence of binge drinking (>13 units per evening in the last month yes/no) was 
assessed at T5, T7, and T8 and a continuous variable was computed with a score ranging from 0 = 
never binge drinker at T5, T7 or T8; 1= binge drinker 1 time-point only; 2= binge drinker at 2 time-
points; and 3= binge drinker at all 3 time-points.  
c. 
Other drug use (yes/no) was assessed at T7 and was coded as yes if the subjects had tried drugs other 
than cannabis. 
 
Childhood risk factors 
Childhood risk factors that may independently contribute to both violence and drug use were included in this 
analysis (Farrington et al. 2006, West and Farrington 1973): 
a. 
Social class (socioeconomic status): This variable was dichotomized, with 2 indicating that the family 
breadwinner (usually the father) had an unskilled manual job. All of the rest were coded as 1.  
b. Family history of criminal/delinquent behaviour was measured up to the boy’s tenth birthday and 
referred only to biological relatives, with 2 indicating the presence of delinquent sibling and/or criminal 
parent. All those without a delinquent sibling and/or parent were coded as 1.  
 
sAppendix 3. Analysis  
Data was analysed using R (R Core Team 2015) comprising four main statistical approaches:  
(1) We used the Kruskal-Wallis Test followed by Bonferroni correction for multiple testing to make 
comparisons among the different cannabis trajectory groups (never use vs. use at 1 point vs. use at 2 
points vs. use at 3 points) on the average number of total convictions committed by age 56/ average 
number of self-reported violence by age 48. This non-parametric test was chosen as the Shapiro-Wilk 
Normality Test statistic was highly significant for number of convictions (p<0.001) and SR-V 
(p<0.001).  
(2) Secondly, univariate logistic regression analysis was employed to estimate the uncontrolled effect of 
cannabis use and other potential risk factors on violence outcome to identify those variables that are 
significantly associated with risk of VC/SR-V. The variables were chosen based on previous research 
(Farrington et al. 2006, Resnick et al. 2004). Subsequently, odds ratios (ORs) were computed using 
multiple logistic regression analysis to examine the relationship between cannabis use and violence 
outcome, while accounting for the covariates retained from the initial bivariate models (all factors with 
p<0.10 were included). The violence (yes/no) dichotomization based on conviction data and the self-
reported violence served as the dependent variable.  
(3) In the third stage, fixed-effects logistic regression models were fitted using the R package lme4 for 
binary outcome data in order to extend the ordinary logistic regression by adjusting for time-invariant 
non-observed fixed factors that vary across individuals, such as family background, genetic profile, 
personality or pre-existing violent traits. This approach allows the estimation of effect of within-person 
changes over time t for cannabis use [t=C1(age 18), C2(age 32), C3(age 48)] on SR-V[t=V1(age 18), 
V2(age 32), V3(age 48)] and VC[t=V1(age 10-18), V2(age 19-32), V3(age 32-56)]. In order to minimize 
any effects that may be at play in the reverse direction (reverse causation, i.e. violence predisposing to 
cannabis use) we (i) implemented fixed-effects models that used lagged outcome, i.e. examined whether 
changes in cannabis use (C1-C2) were associated with subsequent changes in violence (V2-V3) and (ii) 
tested a competing reverse causation model in which we estimated the effects of changes in violence 
(V1-V2) on changes in cannabis use (C2-C3). Alcohol use and cigarette use were included as time-
dynamic covariates in the models. 
                                                        
1 
 For the present analyses, each variable was dichotomized, as far as possible, into the “worst” quarter of 
males  versus the remainder,with those most at risk coded as 2 and the remainder as 1 
 4 
 
(4) Cross-lagged structural equation models were estimated using the lavaan package (Rosseel 2012). The 
cannabis (C2-C3) and violence variables (V2-V3) were treated as dependent variables, allowing to test 
for reciprocal changes in the association at different stages of the life span. We tested both an 
unconstrained model and a model in which the parameters (Ct and Vt) were constrained to be equal 
across time points. The models were fitted using the robust weighted least squares (WSL) approach. 
Model goodness of fit was assessed on the basis of a number of fit indices, including the model chi-
squared goodness of fit statistic (non-significant or small chi-square value indicates that the model fits 
the data well), the root mean squared error of approximation (RMSEA, for which values of .05 indicate 
good fit and values up to .08 represent reasonable errors of approximation) (MacCallum et al. 1996) and 
the Comparative Fit Index (for which values of .95 are acceptable and of .95 or higher are indicative of 
good fit (Hu and Bentler 1999). Cross-sectional correlations between violence and cannabis use at were 
included for t2 and t3. All models were fitted while controlling for time dynamic factors including 
alcohol and cigarette use and time invariant factors including antisocial personality.  
 
sAppendix 4. Supplementary Results 
Out of the 411 boys assessed at baseline, complete multi-wave cannabis and violence data (T1-T8) at follow up 
48 years later was available for a total number of N=340 for SR-V and N=339 for VC. Comparing subjects that 
dropped out throughout follow up (n=71) to completers (n=340) in demographic variables and violence data 
revealed that there were no significant differences between the two groups, expect for self-reported violence at 
age 18, which was less likely to be reported (p=.04) in those who subsequently dropped out (cf. sTable1).

Given the focus of the study, outcome in the uni- and multivariate analysis was defined as violence (yes/no) 
following cannabis use. As a result, for some subjects (n=4 for conviction data, n=1 for SR-V data) the outcome 
was coded as absence of violence since the violent act only preceded cannabis use (cf. sTable 2 above). The 
same multivariate analysis was carried out after recoding the outcome for those subjects (from absence of 
violence to presence of violence), which did not change the main results (cf. sTable 4.below).

Dear Prof. Kendler and Prof. Murray, 
 
Many thanks for this positive response. Please find below our response to the specific points 
raised: 
 
Comment1: In principle we are now prepared to accept it but before we can do so we need 
to ask you to remove Table 1 from the middle of the text and place it at the end, in the 
conventional manner (or if you prefer submit it as a separate file). 
 
Response1: We have acted in accordance and placed Table 1 at the end of the manuscript. 
 
Response2: We corrected a few other things following the submission of the revised version 
- please see below the list of amendments that were implemented in the manuscript: 
 
1.  Page 18, line 6 up from the bottom: ‘that older’ was changed to ‘than older’. 
 
2. One missing sentence and two missing references on Page 2, supplementary 
material (appendix 1. Study sample): The sentence” [e.g. (West and Farrington 
1977, West and Farrington 1973, West 1982, West 1969) and in summary 
papers (Farrington et al. 2006, Farrington 1995, Farrington and West 1990)]” was 
changed to "[a review of major findings may be found in several books (West and 
Farrington 1977, West and Farrington 1973, West 1982, West 1969, Piquero et al. 
2007, Farrington et al. 2013) as well as in several in summary papers (Farrington et 
al. 2006, Farrington 1995, Farrington and West 1990)].” 
These two references were added:

longitudinal study', Addiction 1, 109-118.” 
 
4. Amendment in contribution section (Page 22): The paragraph “SB, DT and DF 
designed the study and supervised the analyses, TS and DT carried out the data 
analysis and wrote the first draft together with SB. All other authors provided data, 
reviewed the results and contributed to the final draft of the manuscript.” was 
changed to  "DF provided the data. SB, DT and DF designed the study and supervised

together with SB. All other authors reviewed the results and contributed to the final 
draft of the manuscript."
