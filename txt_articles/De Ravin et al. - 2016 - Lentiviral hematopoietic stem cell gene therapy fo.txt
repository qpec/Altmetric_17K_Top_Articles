X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID-X1) is a profound deficiency of T, B, and natural killer (NK) cell
immunity caused by mutations in IL2RG encoding the common chain (gc) of several interleukin receptors. Gamma-
retroviral (gRV) gene therapy of SCID-X1 infants without conditioning restores T cell immunity without B or NK cell
correction, but similar treatment fails in older SCID-X1 children. We used a lentiviral gene therapy approach to treat
five SCID-X1 patients with persistent immune dysfunction despite haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) trans-
plant in infancy. Follow-up data from two older patients demonstrate that lentiviral vector gc transduced autologous
HSC gene therapy after nonmyeloablative busulfan conditioning achieves selective expansion of gene-marked T, NK,
and B cells, which is associated with sustained restoration of humoral responses to immunization and clinical improve-
ment at 2 to 3 years after treatment. Similar gene marking levels have been achieved in three younger patients, albeit
with only 6 to 9 months of follow-up. Lentiviral gene therapy with reduced-intensity conditioning appears safe and
can restore humoral immune function to posthaploidentical transplant older patients with SCID-X1.
INTRODUCTION
Haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) with-
out conditioning for treatment of X-linked severe combined immuno-
deficient (SCID-X1) infants achieves ≥70% long-term survival.
However, although donor T cells engraft and are functional, two thirds
of such patients lack B and natural killer (NK) cell reconstitution,
which may ultimately lead to progressive clinical deterioration (1–3).
Gamma-retroviral (gRV) gene therapy without conditioning effectively
corrects the T cell lineage with no transduced B or NK cells in SCID-X1
infants (4) but fails in posthaploidentical HSCT older children, possibly
due to age-related thymic damage (5, 6).
Leukemias occurred in gRV gene therapy for SCID-X1, Wiskott-
Aldrich syndrome (WAS), and chronic granulomatous disease (CGD)
attributable to preferential integration near oncogenes (7–10). Adding
a self-inactivating element (SIN) in gRV gene therapy for SCID-X1
infants resulted in a similar integration pattern as earlier gRV trials,
although less clustering near oncogenes is observed at 38-month follow-
up (11). Unlike murine gRV (mgRV), lentiviral vectors (LVs) do not
preferentially integrate near enhancers and promoters, and successful
SIN-LV gene therapy using marrow conditioning of WAS and meta-
chromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) (12, 13) suggests that SIN-LV may be
applicable to SCID-X1.
Here, we used a codon-optimized SIN-LV (Cl20-i4-EF1a-hgcOPT),
where the elongation factor 1a (EF1a) core promoter element drives
production of the commong chain (gc) with an additional safety feature
of a 400–base pair (bp) chicken b-globin chromatin insulator element
(cHS4) (fig. S10) (14, 15). Preclinical studies demonstrated safety and
efficacy in animal models (16, 17). We report successful SIN-LV gene
therapy of older SCID-X1 patients who had substantial immune and
functional problems after previous haploidentical HSCT. Novel features
of our clinical trial include the first use of SIN-LV to treat SCID-X1, the
first use of busulfan conditioning for gene therapy of SCID-X1, and the
first use of SIN-LV in patients, to be manufactured from a stable LV
producer cell line (18). Reduced-intensity conditioning has proven to be
beneficialingenetherapyforadenosinedeaminase(ADA)deficiencySCID
(ADA-SCID), including the development of gene-marked B and NK cells
(19, 20).

 SIN-LV from stable producer and HSC transduction
The LV used in the study is SIN and uses an EF1a promoter to drive a
codon-optimized human gc complementary DNA (cDNA), flanked
by a 400-bp chicken insulator (14, 15). Unlike gRV that is produced
by stable cell lines, LV used for clinical gene therapy trials thus far
relies on transient, four-plasmid transfections of packaging cells.
The quantity of high-titer clinical-grade vector produced using this
approach is generally insufficient to treat larger (adult) subjects. In
contrast, the stable SIN EF1a-hgcOPT producer can make up to
150 liters of vector at 5 × 106 infectious units (iu)/ml for each produc-
tion run. The downstream process and quality controls resulted in
vector at 4 × 108 to 7 × 108 iu/ml as previously described (15, 18).
CD34+ HSCs were mobilized with granulocyte colony-stimulating
factor (G-CSF) and plerixafor (21) and were collected by apheresis and
cryopreserved. Autologous HSCs (1 × 107 to 2 × 107 CD34+ HSCs/kg)
were prestimulated with stem cell factor Fms-related tyrosine kinase 3
ligand (FLT-3L) and thrombopoietin (100 ng/ml) for 16 hours before
two daily 7-hour transductions at a multiplicity of infection of 100 to
150 with vector concentration ~30% of culture volume (fig. S1). On
day 3, transduced cells were washed and infused after confirmation of
quality and safety criteria. Between 17.0 and 57.7% of colonies derived
from the bulk transduced cells were gene-marked (Table 1).
Multilineage gene marking and immune reconstitution after
gene therapy
Peripheral blood cells from patients were purified by density fraction-
ation and magnetic bead–based immunoselection into lineages includ-
ing polymorphonuclear cells (PMN), CD14, CD3, CD19, and NK cells
(see Supplementary Materials and Methods). Gene marking was
monitored over 2 to 3 years in P1 and P2 and demonstrated an in-
crease in gene marking for all lineages tested (Fig. 1A). Myeloid mark-
ing in PMN and CD14+ cells appeared by 2 weeks and stabilized by
6 months at 0.08 to 0.1 vector copy number (VCN) per cell in both P1
and P2. Vector marking of B and NK cells appeared later, but the
levels exceeded those of myeloid cells at 0.30 to 0.40 and 0.56 to
0.77 VCN, respectively. T cell marking lagged until 5 to 6 months after
treatment but steadily increased to 0.13 to 0.57 VCN. CD14+ and B cell
marking occurs early in all five patients, particularly in P4 and P5,
who received relatively larger doses of corrected HSCs (Fig. 1B). Gene
marking was also evident in circulating peripheral blood CD34+ HSCs
from P1 and P2 at 1 year and at 4 months, respectively, approaching
the myeloid levels (Fig. 1A).
Emergence of gene-corrected autologous T cells
To preserve donor T cells, patients did not receive T cell–depleting
agents. Autologous T cells, identified by microsatellite DNA finger-
printing chimerism analysis, increased about 10 months after treat-
ment (Fig. 1C), corresponding to the increase in T cell vector
marking and T cell numbers in P1 (Fig. 1D). In P2, increased gene
marking in T cells with concomitant increased autologous T cell chi-
merism without substantial changes in his total number of T cells
likely reflected a replacement of donor T cells by the autologous
gene-corrected T cells (Fig. 1D). A possible explanation for the rela-
tive survival advantage of autologous gene-corrected T cells may be
the better crosstalk between autologous T cells and the other im-
mune cells or the constitutive expression of gc, although no increases
in the expression of gc or its downstream signaling component JAK3
(Janus kinase 3) were found in the earlier gene therapy trials (22). T
cell receptor excision circles (TRECs), a measure of thymus-derived
T cells, increased from <25 TREC/mg to 90 to 120 TREC/mg DNA in
both P1 and P2, where the lower limit of normal range for this assay
is 75 TREC/mg DNA (fig. S4). In vitro T cell functional responses to
mitogenic stimulation were significantly improved after treatment
(Fig. 2A). Because of a lag in the appearance of gene-marked im-
mune cells, a less substantial increase is expected in P3 to P5 at this
early stage (fig. S5).

 Gene-corrected transitional B cells and
humoral reconstitution
Gene-corrected B cells emigrating from bone marrow first appear in
peripheral blood as immature/transitional T1 (CD10++/CD21lo) B cells,
which increased in P3 from 2.6% before treatment to 25% at 8 weeks
after treatment (Fig. 2, B and C), subsequently differentiating into tran-
sitional T2/T3 (CD10+/CD21hi) B cells with a concomitant decrease in
T1 being noted from 9 weeks (Fig. 2, B and C), consistent with previ-
ously described phenotypes (14, 23). The derivation of T1 and T2/3 B
cells was confirmed by gene marking in sorted B cell subsets, with VCN
in T1>T2/3>naïve> myeloid for P3 to P5 (Fig. 2F). Longer follow-up in
P1 and P2 demonstrated functional correction in B cells with class
switching to IgG+CD27+ memory B cells (fig. S6) and normal IgG
(Fig. 2D). In all patients, serum IgM increased starting about 3 months
after therapy (Fig. 2E). Interpretation of IgG production in patients
receiving IgG supplements is challenging, although IgM levels are
not affected by IgG supplementation. Along with the early appearance
of gene-marked B cells, serum IgM levels also increased early with the
greatest increases seen in P1 and P4. These subjects had the largest
proportion of vector-positive colonies from the CFU assay performed
on the bulk transduced HSCs, especially P4, who also achieved the highest
level of busulfan AUC and received the most CD34+ cells. A diagnostic
workup for monoclonal gammopathy in P1 (including positron emis-
sion tomography–computed tomography) was negative, and the in-
creased IgM levels spontaneously declined as the IgG levels increased.
Response to IL21 was demonstrated in vitro with peripheral blood cells
from P1 at 6 months after therapy (Fig. 3A). Enzyme-linked immuno-
spot (ELISpot) analysis of P1 before and after vaccination with the 2013
flu vaccine (at 12 months after therapy) demonstrated significantly
increased vaccine-specific IgG+ B cell frequencies, as well as the total
number of IgG+ B cells, thus confirming reconstitution of humoral im-
munity (Fig. 3B). Vaccine-induced responses to polio, diphtheria, teta-
nus, haemophilus were observed in P1 and P2, including a robust
response in P1 to antirabies vaccination, a U.S. Food and Drug Admin-
istration (FDA)–approved antigen, achieving an antirabies titer of 11.3
international units/ml (>0.5 IU/ml represents acceptable response). Of
note, the improved B cell responses may be attributable to the interac-
tion of the gene-corrected B cells with either the donor T cells or the
autologous gene-corrected T cells.
Gene marking in CD3−CD56+ NK cells also appeared by 2 months
and doubled by 15 months for P2 (Fig. 1A). Posttherapy NK cells had
features of mature NK cells similar to those observed in healthy
controls (fig. S7). The increase in P2’s NK cell numbers coincided with
shrinkage of warts (Fig. 4A).
Clinical benefits
For P2, extensive molluscum contagiosum and disfiguring warts on
both hands improved after gene therapy (Fig. 4A). Chronic (>2 years
before treatment) norovirus infections in P1 and P2 were cleared with-
in 21 months of therapy, and severe protein-losing enteropathy was
resolved with normalization of albumin, and weight gain indicative of
an improved nutritional state (Fig. 4, B and C). P2 entered the study
with bronchiectasis with irreversible airway damage (fig. S8) compli-
cated by severely impaired pulmonary function (<40% of normal).
Worsening lung disease led to a fatal pulmonary bleed at 27 months
after gene therapy.
Vector integration clonality analysis
Vector integration site analysis (VISA) of sorted blood lineages in P1
and P2, using previously described methods (24, 25), identified
333,822 integration events, of which 38% were unique integration sites
and most clones comprising <1% of total sites (Fig. 5A). Using the
Chao estimator for species richness, we observed the greatest diver-
sity in B cells, followed by myeloid cells, then T and NK cells (table
S2) (26). In addition to the diversity of the integration site repertoire,
our goal is to be able to detect clone(s) that may undergo any signif-
icant expansion. Oligoclonality index (27) may overestimate polyclon-
ality in situations of limited library size or sample material, further
described in the Supplementary Materials and Methods. To facilitate
comparison of clonal expansion between samples, we determined the
number of unique clones comprising the top 50% of the total clones,
the unique clone index (UC50) (Fig. 5A) (Supplementary Materials
and Methods). UC50 for NK cells suggests a more limited diversity

 with 79 clones comprising half of all NK cells for P1 at 30 months, and 7
for P2 at 24 months (Fig. 5A). Quantitative digital droplet polymerase
chain reaction (ddPCR) surveillance of the most abundant clones re-
vealed the fluctuations in clonal abundance within each lineage (Fig.
5B). Although individual clones transiently increased in abundance, in
particular those possessing integrations near the TNFSF12 and the
PIM1 gene, these declined over time.
Vector integration site distribution
A comparison of P1’s and P2’s VISA data
sets to an in vitro LV-transduced CD34+
cell library data set (259,648 unique sites)
mapped across the human genome (Fig.
6, and table S5) confirms LV’s preferential
targeting of actively expressed genes and
gene-dense regions (79% within genes
versus 39% for random control) (24, 25)
(discussed further in the Supplementary
Materials and Methods). Also evident from
this comparison is that the in vivo integra-
tion site repertoire is remarkably similar
to that of the input clones, highlighting
the dominant effect of the vector-specific
integration preferences retained in in vivo
patient samples independent of disease
or therapeutic gene (WAS, MLD, and ad-
renoleukodystrophy) transferred (12, 13).
A comparison of shared integration sites
between different lineages at different time
points, or similarity index, shows highly
variable integration site in myeloid cells,
consistent with the increased cell turnover
rates in myeloid compared with T cells
(fig. S9).
Many of the integration sites in our pa-
tient samples are shared with the common
integration sites (CIS) in the lentiviral
WAS trial (12), although they do not ap-
pear to be enriched compared to the ini-
tial in vitro CD34+ cell library, suggesting
a lack of selective in vivo expansion. In
contrast, HMGA2 has multiple unique
integrations, most of which are in the
same orientation, especially in intron 3
(Fig. 5C). Although over 38-fold enrich-
ment in HMGA2 contribution is ob-
served in vitro, the overall contribution
from HMGA2 integrant clones remained
very low in all gene-marked cells (~1%),
with no significant expansion of any
single clone. In the b-thalassemia study,
a single HMGA2 integrant clone was
highly expanded because of an alternative
splice acceptor created by the unstable 2 ×
250–bp cHS4 insulator core that resulted
in the overexpression of a truncated and
more stable HMGA2 (high-mobility
group AT-hook 2) protein (29). Using
primers targeting the flanking insulators
(fig. S10), we confirmed the integrity of our transgene sequence around
the insulators, without any evidence for rearrangement. To assess for
potential biological effects of the low-level expansion of HMGA2 inte-
grant clones, the expression level of HMGA2 in different lineages of PB
from P1 and P2 was determined using ddPCR assays for the 5′ (exon 3,
before integration sites) and 3′ (exon 4/5, after integration site). Expres-
sion of HMGA2 in all cell lineages was low (data not shown), and the

DISCUSSION
This study describes the first successful SIN-LV gene therapy with
low-dose busulfan conditioning of older SCID-X1 patients who had
failed previous HSCT. In P1 and P2, with ≥2-year follow-up, signif-
icant stable gene marking in multiple hematopoietic lineages coin-
cided with reconstitution of humoral immunity, specific vaccine
responses, and marked clinical improvement, in contrast to restricted
T cell marking in prior mgRV gene therapy trials without con-
ditioning (4). This was also the first use of SIN-LV made by a stable
producer cell line, GPRG-gc, with multiple copies of SIN vector gen-
omes generated by a concatemeric array transfection technique (18)
that permitted production of high-titer vector (>108 iu/ml) sufficient
to treat >1 × 109 or 2 × 107/kg cells for each patient (17). Despite
reported improved outcomes with myeloid conditioning in ADA-
SCID and WAS gene therapy trials, particularly with regard to B or
NK cell reconstitution, no myeloconditioning has been used in
SCID-X1 to date (19, 30). Substantial multilineage marking in this
study underscores the importance of myeloconditioning to improve
engraftment in SCID-X1, although LV likely also targets HSCs more
efficiently, because mgRV gene therapy
with busulfan conditioning in CGD
(18) and WAS (19) did not result in sig-
nificant B cell gene marking.
Humoral reconstitution in P1 and P2
corresponded with the eradication of
chronic norovirus in P1 and P2, a poorly
appreciated medical problem in SCID-
X1 patients with incomplete immune re-
constitution after prior haploidentical
HSCT without conditioning. Despite
minimal diarrhea, chronic norovirus in-
fection in these patients can result in a
protein-losing enteropathy, electrolyte,
mineral, and vitamin losses, and subse-
quent nutritional and growth failure
with endoscopic appearance of celiac-
like flat or blunted villi. It is interesting
that the gene-corrected B cells were able
to eradicate the norovirus, whereas both
oral IgG (used by some to treat chronic
norovirus) and intravenous IgG failed,
suggesting a potentially unique role for
gut lamina propria B cells in the control
of norovirus.
We also report the first substantial
gene marking and correction of NK cells
in SCID-X1 after gene therapy with sub-
stantial clinical improvement of warts
and molluscum (31). In contrast to the
rapid expansion of gene-corrected T cells
in SCID-X1 infants after gene therapy,
the T cell marking in adult P1 and P2
increased slowly. Before gene therapy,
P1 and P2 lacked donor stem cells, and together with the absence of
TRECs, this suggests that circulating T cells were from a long-lived thy-
mic population. The number of gene-corrected autologous cells
continues to outcompete donor T cells as indicated by the T cell chi-
merism assays, and the increase in TRECs indicates the presence of at
least some residual thymic function. Longer-term follow-up of similarly
treated, but younger, SCID-X1 patients will shed light on the relative
importance of a more preserved thymus. Of note, the increase of all
lineages (T, B, and NK cells) continues steadily, and stable CD34+ cell
VCN even at 3 years after therapy (in P1) demonstrates the persist-
ence of LV-corrected HSCs.
Quantitative ddPCR surveillance of specific clones revealed dy-
namic fluctuations in clonal contribution such as integrations near
PIM1, TNFSF12, and HMGA2; PIM1 transiently exceeded 20% of
marked T cells but less than 4% of the total lineage. These clones de-
creased spontaneously over time. The integration profile in the patients
is likely shaped by two major factors: first, the vector-preferred integra-
tion pattern at initial transduction, and second, the selective expansion
in vivo. Most of the CIS identified in our study and in previous studies
simply reflect the initial integration preference of LV, with no signif-
icant enrichment in vivo of any of the top CIS. With an in vitro CD34
integration data set as a reference baseline of input clones, in vivo clonal
expansion determined by fold increase over in vitro sample revealed
in vivo expansion of HMGA2, previously described in b-thalassemia

 lentiviral gene therapy trial (29). Multiple independent integration
sites in the HMG2A gene were found in both P1 and P2, but unlike
the single HMGA2 restricted to the myeloid lineage in the b-thalassemia
trial, the HMGA2 clones in P1 and P2 were present in all cell
lineages (myeloid, T, B, and NK cells), suggesting the growth advan-
tage occurred in stem cells. Furthermore, overexpression of the trun-
cated HMGA2 gene selectively occurred
in erythroblasts but remained unde-
tectable in granulocytes-monocytes de-
spite presence of the same clone at a
greater frequency (29). This suggests
that the transcription of HMGA2 gene
is under tight regulation, with variable
expression in specific cell types at specif-
ic time points. We hypothesize that the
integrations in this study found in the
HMGA2 intron 3 transiently provide
some growth advantage of host cells
by production of the more stable trun-
cated protein at a certain time point, but
HMGA2 gene remains under the con-
trol and regulation of its native promo-
ters and can be turned off during the
natural cell cycle or cell differentiation,
which accounts for the absence of over-
expression in P1 and P2 cells. The endo-
genous expression control for HMGA2
gene likely limits the growth expansion
influence from the HMGA2 integration
clones. Ongoing monitoring of HMGA2
and other integration sites will shed fur-
ther light on this.
Because SCID-X1 is a rare disease, a
limitation of this study is the small
number of patients treated. Further-
more, all patients have received prior
haploidentical stem cell transplant that
resulted in varying degrees of immune
reconstitution. Consequently, the study
population is heterogenous with a range
of complex underlying medical problems
that may impact the results. Although
only the first two older patients have
been observed up to 2 to 3 years, early
myeloid gene marking corresponds to
B cell gene marking and humoral im-
munity improvement, providing possible
early indicators of outcome. Because
vector-related mutagenesis did not ap-
pear until 3 to 4 years after gene therapy
in the SCID-X1 infants (22), insertion-
related mutagenesis cannot be definitively
excluded, although the diverse repertoire
of integrations to date, and the absence
of adverse events in the larger experience
with LV gene therapy in other diseases, is
reassuring. Our results from the young
adult patients suggest that LV-mediated
gene therapy with reduced intensity conditioning is a promising ap-
proach for treatment of SCID-X1, including in older patients. Such in-
terventions should be considered early to minimize irreversible organ
damage from suboptimal immune reconstitution, because T cell recon-
stitution alone is clearly not sufficient to prevent or reverse progressive
injury to lungs.

 MATERIALS AND METHODS
This is a phase 1/2 nonrandomized clinical trial of ex vivo HSC gene
transfer treatment for SCID-X1 using a SIN, insulated LV. The study
is approved by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Dis-
eases (NIAID) Institutional Regulatory Board (clinical protocol
#11-I-0007, ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT01306019) and Institutional Bio-
safety Committee, FDA (investigational new drug #15041), spon-
sored by the NIAID Regulatory Compliance and Human Subjects
Protection Branch.
Lentiviral vector
The Cl20-i4-EF1a-hgcOPT used in this clinical trial is the first use of
LV produced by a previously described stable inducible LV producer cell
line GPRTG (15, 18). This is a vesicular stomatitis virus G (VSV-G)–
pseudotyped, third-generation SIN vector that uses a promoter frag-
ment from the eukaryotic EF1a gene to express a codon-optimized
human gc cDNA and contains a 400-bp
insulator fragment from the chicken
b-globin locus within the SIN long
terminal repeat (LTR). Large-scale clin-
ical grade vector was manufactured at
St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital
Vector Facility as previously published
(15, 18). Briefly, producer cells were
cultured in WAVE Bioreactor System
(GE Healthcare Biosciences), and
harvests were filtered (Millipore),
followed by a Mustang Q ion exchange
(Pall) and a final concentration by dia-
filtration (Millipore) (15). Titers of the
vector were 4.5 to 7.2 × 108 iu/ml.
Autologous CD34+ HSCs
collection and isolation
Patients receive G-CSF at 16 mg/kg
per day by subcutaneous (sc) injection
for five consecutive days, supplemented
by plerixafor (0.24 mg/kg, sc, 11 hours
before collection) [National Institutes
of Health (NIH) protocol 94-I-0073]
before apheresis at the NIH Clinical
Center (22). The products were pro-
cessed using FDA-approved Isolex im-
mune anti-CD34 magnetic bead system
to isolate and enrich CD34+ cells by the
NIH Department of Transfusion Med-
icine Cell Processing Facility. Purified
CD34+ HSCs were cryopreserved until
gene therapy.
Transduction of CD34+ HSCs
Ex vivo culture and transduction of the
patient’s autologous CD34+ HSCs with
VSV-G–pseudotyped Cl20-i4-EF1a-
hgcOPT LV were performed and
certified by the NIH Department of
Transfusion Medicine Cell Processing
Facility. Transduction involves thawing and suspension of patient
CD34+ HSCs in X-VIVO 10 serum-free growth medium [containing
1%humanserumalbuminpluscytokines(stemcellfactor,50to100ng/ml;
FLT-3L,50to100ng/ml;thrombopoietin,50to100ng/ml;IL-3,5ng/ml)].
The cells were cultured in T175 tissue culture flasks coated with the re-
combinant fibronectin fragment known as RetroNectin and exposed
to LV for 6 to 8 hours each day for two consecutive days after an
overnight prestimulation. Transduced CD34+ HSCs were washed
and infused over <30 min at the end of culture after required safety test-
ing and quality control testing.
Conditioning regimen
A dose lower than that used in gRV gene therapy for CGD (10 mg/kg)
(18) but higher than the dose used in gRV gene therapy for ADA
(4 mg/kg) was chosen, at 6 mg/kg given over 2 days. The busulfan
levels are shown in Table 1; no dose adjustment was given. No T cell–
or B cell–depleting agents were given.

 Clinical course
No adverse events were noted with the infusion of the transduced
CD34+ HSC cell product. The nadir for the expected busulfan-related
effects of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia occurred at 2
to 3 weeks after treatment (fig. S2) and were recovered without requir-
ing any cellular support or intervention. Subjects were discharged
home by 3 to 4 weeks after gene therapy. Three of the five patients
developed febrile neutropenia that responded to empiric antimicro-
bial therapy. An overview of the study implementation is shown in
table S1.
Laboratory evaluation
Cell lineage separation for gene marking and integration analysis.
After polymorphonuclear granulocyte (PMN) separation using Histo-
paque, the mononuclear leukocyte layer was fractionated by magnetic
beads per manufacturer’s instructions (Dynal Beads, Invitrogen) (Sup-
plementary Materials and Methods). The purity of the bead-sorted
PMN from a healthy donor was analyzed (fig. S3).
B cell preparations, flow cytometry phenotyping, and functional
analyses. Immunophenotyping and cell sorting were performed on
freshly processed PBMCs or PBMCs that had been cryopreserved with
the following anti-human monoclonal antibodies: allophycocyanin
(APC) anti-CD10, APC-H7 anti-CD20, and phycoerythrin (PE) anti-
IgG (BD Biosciences); peridinin chlorophyll protein–Cy5.5 anti-CD19
and PE-Cy7 anti-CD27 (eBioscience); fluorescein isothiocyanate anti-
CD21 (Beckman Coulter); VioBlue anti-IgA (Miltenyi Biotec); and
Brilliant Violet 510 anti-IgM. Cell sorting and immunophenotyping
were performed on BD FACSAria II and BD FACSCanto II (BD Bio-
sciences) flow cytometers, respectively. Analyses were performed with
FlowJo version 9.8.5 software (Tree Star). Memory B cell responses to
influenza were performed by ELISpot as previously described (23), with
B cells isolated by negative magnetic bead–based selection (STEMCELL
Technologies). Phenotyping of immune cells by flow cytometry was
also performed by the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments–
certified Clinical Immunology Laboratory/Department of Laboratory
Medicine at the NIH Clinical Center.
B cell proliferation and class switching in response to IL21/CD40L.
PBMCs of a healthy donor and P1 were labeled with CFSE (0.5 mM;
Molecular Probes) and cultured with IL21 (50 ng/ml; PeproTech) and
CD40L (500 ng/ml) (24–26). B cell proliferation was determined by
CFSE dilution, and immunoglobulin class switch was measured by in-
tracellular expression of IgG and IgM using flow cytometry.
Peripheral blood CD34+ cell purification and expansion for
VCN and integration site analyses. PBMCs were purified from non-
mobilized peripheral blood by Ficoll separation (Lymphocyte Separa-
tion Medium, MP Biomedicals). CD34+ cells were isolated from
PBMCs using magnetic cell sorter magnetic beads (Miltenyi Biotec)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. CD34+ cells were expanded
for 8 to 12 days in StemSpan II media (STEMCELL Technologies)
supplemented with 100 ng/ml each of human stem cell factor, FLT-
3L, and thrombopoietin (PeproTech). DNA was isolated using the
DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (QIAGEN).
Quantitative determination of VCN by ddPCR. To measure the
vector-carrying cells, we used a ddPCR (Bio-Rad) assay. The ddPCR
assay allows the measurement of absolute copy number without using
standard curve. The vector-specific primers and probes are as follows:
HIV forward, 5′-CTGTTGTGTGACTCTGGTAACT-3′; HIV reverse,
5′-TTCGCTTTCAAGTCCCTGTT-3′; and HIV probe, 5′-/56-FAM/
AAATCTCTA/ZEN/GCAGTGGCGCCCG/3IABkFQ/-3′. We multi-
plexed a reference gene assay for cell counts in the same reaction
[myocardin-like protein 2 (MKL2): forward, 5′-AGATCA-
GAAGGGTGAGAAGAATG-3′; reverse, 5′-GGATGGTCTGG-
TAGTTGTAGTG-3′; and probe, 5′-/56-HEX/TGTTCCTGC/ZEN/
AACTGCAGATCCTGA/3IABkFQ/-3′]. Cell number was calculated
as half of the MKL2 counts because each cell is diploid. VCN was
calculated as vectors per cell.
Monitoring clonal expansion of specific integration site. Top ex-
panded clones identified by the VISA sequencing assay were followed
up and monitored by specific ddPCR assay. All of our ddPCR assays
consist of a common LTR primer, an LTR probe, and a specific
primer for genomic DNA junction [5LTR reverse, 5′-CTGCAGG-
GATCTTGTCTTCTT-3′; 5LTR junction probe, 5′-/56-FAM/
TGGAAGGGC/ZEN/TAATTCACTCCCA/3IABkFQ/-3′; PIM1-
5LTR primer, 5′-TCCTAACATCCCCACTGCAT-3′; TNFSF12-
5LTR primer, 5′-ACAGTAAAGCAAGAGTGGGATG-3′; 3LTR
forward, 5′-CCCACTGCTTAAGCCTCAATA-3′; 3LTR junction
probe, 5′-/56-FAM/AAGTAGTGT/ZEN/GTGCCCGTCTGTTGT/
3IABkFQ/-3′; CDKN1A (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A)–
3LTR primer, 5′-GCACGAAATCACTGCCATATTC-3′]. We multi-
plexed the integration site–specific assay together with the MKL2
reference gene assay, which measures cell counts in the same reaction
(28). The use of ddPCR makes it possible to (i) monitor the specific
integration site accurately, (ii) use limited amount of input DNA, and
(iii) make monitoring of expanded clones easy over time and across
many different cell lineages.
Evaluation of insulator size in peripheral blood cells from P1
Genomic DNA P1 was used for PCR amplification; used PCR
primer sequences for the 5′ LTR were 5′-CTGGAAGGGCTAATT-
CACTC-3′ (P1) and 5′-TCGCGATCTAATTCTCC-3′ (P2), and
for the 3′ LTR were 5′-GCGGCCGCATCGATGCCGTATAC-3′
(P3) and 5′-CTGCTAGAGATTTTCCACAC-3′ (P4). The expected
size of the 5′ and 3′ LTR PCR fragments with the intact 400-bp
insulator element was 851 and 791 bp, respectively (the exact
length of both LTRs is 649 bp without insulator). The sequences
of the two PCR fragments were confirmed by direct DNA sequencing
of the PCR product. The smaller band (around 500 bp) with the P1/P2
primer was TA-cloned and TA-sequenced, confirming a mispriming of
P2 in the R region, which resulted in the artifact, and that the 400-bp
insulator is intact.
