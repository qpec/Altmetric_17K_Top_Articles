Background:
Quaternary
ammonium
compounds
are
a
large
class
of
chemicals used for their antimicrobial and antistatic properties. Two common
quaternary ammonium compounds, alkyldimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride
(ADBAC) and didecyldimethyl ammonium chloride (DDAC), are combined in
common cleaners and disinfectants. Introduction of a cleaner containing
ADBAC1DDAC in the vivarium caused neural tube defects (NTDs) in mice
and rats. Methods: To further evaluate this finding, male and female mice
were dosed in the feed at 60 or 120 mg/kg/day, or by oral gavage at 7.5, 15,
or 30 mg/kg ADBAC1DDAC. Mice also received ambient exposure to
ADBAC1DDAC from the disinfectant used in the mouse room. Embryos were
evaluated on gestational day 10 for NTDs, and fetuses were evaluated on
gestational day 18 for gross and skeletal malformations. Results: We found
increased NTDs with exposure to ADBAC1DDAC in both rats and mice. The
NTDs persisted for two generations after cessation of exposure. Notably, male
exposure alone was sufficient to cause NTDs. Equally significant, ambient
exposure from disinfectant use in the vivarium, influenced the levels of NTDs
to a greater extent than oral dosing. No gross or significant axial skeletal
malformations were observed in late gestation fetuses. Placental abnormalities
and late gestation fetal deaths were increased at 120 mg/kg/day, which might
explain the lack of malformations observed in late gestation fetuses.
Conclusion: These results demonstrate that ADBAC1DDAC in combination
are teratogenic to rodents. Given the increased use of these disinfectants,
further evaluation of their safety in humans and their contribution to health
and disease is essential.

Introduction
Quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) are a large
class of chemicals used for their antimicrobial and anti-
static
properties.
They
are
common
ingredients
in
cleaners and disinfectants, hand wipes, food preservatives,
swimming pool treatments, laundry products, shampoos,
conditioners, eye drops, and other personal care products.
QACs have been in use for over 60 years, but the number
of products containing QACs has increased recently as the
versatility of these compounds is recognized. Over time,
the chemical structure has been altered to increase anti-
microbial and surfactant efficacy resulting in multiple
generations of QACs. Many products now contain a combi-
nation of two or more QACs. In general, QACs have been
considered relatively safe. Published studies on the toxic-
ity of single QACs are limited, and there are no studies
examining
the
teratogenicity
of
QAC
combinations.
Because chemical mixtures can act synergistically to pro-
duce greater toxic effects than the sum of the individual
components, evaluation of common mixtures is essential
in the evaluation of chemical risk (Hermens et al., 1985;
Faust et al., 2003; Narotsky et al., 2011).
Our interest with QACs began when both the Hunt and
Hrubec Laboratories independently noted abrupt declines
in mouse colony productivity, along with declines in fetal
health, that coincided with the introduction of disinfec-
tants containing the QACs, alkyl (60% C14, 25% C12, 15%
C16) dimethyl benzyl ammonium chloride (ADBAC) and
didecyl dimethyl ammonium chloride (DDAC). The first
instance occurred after relocation of the Hunt laboratory
to Washington State University (WSU) with the onset of
poor pregnancy rates, late fetal demise, and increased dys-
tocia. The WSU experience provided important preliminary
data that were briefly discussed in a published interview
(Hunt, 2008). Several years later, the Hrubec laboratory at
Virginia Tech (VA Tech) encountered breeding problems
and neural tube birth defects (NTDs) that began shortly
after a change in room disinfectants. The experiences in
both the Hunt and Hrubec labs pointed to the QAC disin-
fectant but could not confirm toxicity because neither inci-
dent tested QACs under experimental conditions.
The literature contained no published studies evaluat-
ing developmental or reproductive toxicity of ADBAC1

 DDAC. To fill this data gap, we evaluated the reproductive
and developmental toxicity of these common disinfectants.
Reproductive studies demonstrated that QACs adversely
affect both male and female fertility and fecundity in
rodents (Melin et al., 2014, 2016). In this study, we pres-
ent our findings on the developmental toxicity of a com-
mon formulation mixture of ABDAC1DDAC found in many
household and industrial cleaning products.
Materials and Methods
FACILITIES
Because ambient exposure from disinfectant use in the
mouse room had a greater impact on NTD outcome than the
dosing regimens, the facilities and QAC usage therein are
described in detail as follows. Five rooms in three separate
animal facilities were used during the course of the study
(Table 1; Fig. 1). NTDs were first observed (experiment 1,
abbreviated E1) in control mice and rats housed in Facility
A-Room 1 (abbreviated Room A1), which used ADBAC1D-
DAC disinfectant. To prevent ambient exposure, control ani-
mals were moved to an adjacent room (Facility A-Room 2,
abbreviated Room A2), which was thoroughly cleaned to
remove QAC residues and ethanol was used as the disinfect-
ant. Thus, for experiment 2 (abbreviated E2), control and
exposed animals were housed in Room A2 and Room A1,
respectively; however, when analysis of caging materials
indicated contamination in Room A2, mice were moved to a
separate facility (Facility B) where only chlorine dioxide dis-
infectant was used. Breeding stock and control mice for all
subsequent experiments were maintained in Facility B.
Exposed mice for E4 were housed in Room A1; however,
midway through E4 the use of the QAC disinfectant in Room
A1 was discontinued in the facility, to denote this, the room
was redesignated as Room A3. Because the cessation of QAC
disinfectant use in the mouse room significantly reduced the
incidence of NTDs in exposed mice in E5, exposures for E6
were conducted in a third facility (Facility C) where
ADBAC1DDAC disinfectants remained in use.
In all animal rooms, personnel donned hair bonnets,
face masks, disposable gowns, gloves, and dedicated foot-
wear. Additionally, to reduce potential ADBAC1DDAC con-
tamination, control rooms were entered first and not re-
entered the same day. All rooms were climate-controlled
with a 12-hr light/dark cycle, 20 to 25 8C, and 30 to 60%
relative humidity. All rooms were serviced by the same
animal care staff following the same husbandry proce-
dures in each building.

ments. In all, six experiments were conducted, numbered 1 to 6. Three ani-
mal facilities were used, indicated as Facility A, B, or C. Within Facility A,

 ANIMALS
All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee at the VA-MD College of
Veterinary Medicine, VA Tech, an AAALAC accredited facil-
ity. The initial CD-1 mice and Sprague Dawley rats were
purchased (Charles River Labs, Raleigh, NC). After initial
observation of NTDs in rats and mice, new animals were
purchased and were raised for 2 generations. QAC-free
breeding stock were re-derived once or twice each year to
prevent inbreeding and genetic drift. For all experiments,
mice were housed in disposable caging (Innovive, San
Diego, CA) and provided distilled water. Rats were housed
in new polycarbonate caging. Mice and rats were fed
standard rodent diet (Teklad 7013, Envigo, Indianapolis,
IN). Exposed and control mice for E2 and E4 were fed a
gel diet (Bio-Serv, Frenchtown, NJ) prepared according to
manufacturer instructions. For breeding, mice were paired
two or three females to one unrelated male while rats
were paired one to one. After pairing for breeding, females
were checked for copulation plugs each morning. When a
sperm plug was found, dams were designated as gesta-
tional day (GD) 0.
QAC DOSING
For E2 and E4, mice were dosed by adding 60 or 120 mg
ADBAC1DDAC/kg body weight/day of commercial disin-
fectant (Labsan 256-cpq, Sanitation Strategies, Holt, MI) in
Nutra-gel diet. Doses below the LOAEL were selected as
described in Melin et al. (2014). Doses were calculated
based on the sum of active ingredient in the disinfectant
(6.76% ADBAC [60% C-14, 25% C-12, 15% C-16] and
10.1% DDAC), with an average daily food consumption of
28% body weight as described in Melin et al. (2014). An
excess of gel food was provided fresh daily so as not to
restrict food intake, and intake was monitored daily. There
was no difference in food consumption between treatment
groups (data not shown).
Mice were acclimated to undosed gel diet for 1 week
before dosing and then dosed for 8 weeks. For E5 and E6,
mice were dosed by oral gavage with ADBAC1DDAC
chemical. ADBAC (Sigma Chemical, St Louis, MO) and
DDAC (AK Scientific Inc., Union City, CA) were diluted in
water to give the same compound ratio and alkyl chain
lengths as in the disinfectant product (6.76% ADBAC
(60% C-14, 25% C-12, 15% C-16) and 10.1% DDAC).
Males were dosed every other day for 10 days before
breeding to allow sufficient time for transit of exposed
sperm into the epididymis (Dadoune and Alfonsi, 1984).
Females were dosed once on the morning of GD 8, the
time of neural tube closure. Doses were selected based on
a preliminary dose finding study (data not shown). In E5,
there was no ambient ADBAC1DDAC exposure and males
were dosed at 30 mg/kg while females were dosed at
15 mg/kg. In E6, the dose was lowered to 7.5 mg/kg for
both males and females to remain below the LOAEL due
to the additive ambient exposure from disinfectant use in
the room.
EVALUATION OF MALFORMATIONS
For each experiment, pregnant females in both exposure
and control groups were euthanized by an overdose of
CO2 within approximately 1 hr of each other. For GD 9.5 to
10 embryos, the uterus was removed and fixed in 10%
buffered formalin. After fixation, decidua were removed
and the embryos dissected. All embryos and fetuses were
assessed with the evaluator blind to treatment group.
Each embryo was evaluated for stage of development,
somite number, closure of the neural tube, the presence of
pharyngeal arches, cardiac prominence and limb buds. The
GD 18 fetuses were detached from the uterus; the fetal
membranes were removed and the fetus and placenta
weighed separately. Resorptions were characterized as
early or late based on size; mummified fetuses were
included as late resorptions. Fetuses were evaluated for
gross morphologic lesions and fixed in 95% ethanol.
Fetuses were cleared, in potassium hydroxide and stained
with alcian blue and alizarin red to visualize the skeleton
(Hrubec et al., 2006a). Fetuses were photographed (SZX7
sterozoom microscope with Ilumina camera, Olympus,
Center Valley, NJ) and the axial skeletons evaluated for
head length, vertebral, rib and sternal number, and malfor-
mations using Image-J (Hrubec et al., 2006a).
ASSESSING CAGE CONTAMINATION
In E2, ADBAC residues in mouse boxes were analyzed
using liquid chromatography with ultra-violet detection
(LC/UV). DDAC cannot be measured by UV and was not
determined. New unused boxes and boxes after a week’s
use from each dose group were tested. Cage extracts were
obtained as described previously by Melin et al. (2014)
using LC/MS grade methanol (Fisher Scientific, Waltham,
MA). Two composite samples were made for each dose
group; each composite sample contained the extract of five
boxes. Each composite sample was run in duplicate.
ADBAC standards for each alkyl chain length were pur-
chased (C12, C14, C16; Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and
dissolved in water to 1, 5, and 10 ppm. C18, which is not
present in the ADBAC disinfectant, was used at 10 ppm as
an internal standard to calculate recovery.
The ADBAC extraction procedure was performed as fol-
lows: 5 ml of the cage extract was evaporated and C18
internal standard, and 1 ml water was added to the resi-
due. This solution was loaded onto an Oasis WCX solid-
phase extraction column (Waters Corporation, Milford,
MA) conditioned with 1 ml of methanol and 1 ml of water.
The column was then washed once with 1 ml of 5%
ammonium hydroxide, and twice with 1 ml of methanol.
The ADBAC was eluted with 1 ml of 2% formic acid in
methanol, evaporated, and reconstituted in 100 ll of water.
The sample was then analyzed by high performance liquid

 chromatography with a UV detector (Agilent Technologies
Zorbax Eclipse C8 150 3 4.6, 5 l, 1 ml/min flow rate) at
280 nm.
EXPERIMENT 1: IDENTIFICATION OF POSSIBLE TERATOGENICITY
NTDs were first observed in control animals in mice and
rats housed in Room A1 (N 5 13 litters of mice and 20 lit-
ters of rats). The appearance of NTDs in GD 10 mouse
embryos and GD 11 rat embryos coincided with a switch
in the disinfectant used in the rodent room to one contain-
ing ADBAC1DDAC. To eliminate exposure to ADBAC1
DDAC, animals were moved to Room A2, raised for two
generations, and NTDs evaluated again (N 5 9 litters mice
and 9 litters rats).
EXPERIMENT 2: INITIAL TERATOGENICITY STUDY
To directly assess the teratogenic effect of ADBAC1DDAC,
mice reared in Room A2 were randomly divided at 6 to 8
weeks of age into three groups of 8 males and 24 females
per group. One group received undosed gel diet while the
other groups received gel diet with 60 or 120 mg/kg/day
ADBAC1DDAC for 8 weeks. Males and females were then
combined for mating; mice continued to receive dosed gel
diet throughout mating and gestation. For each group, half
the females were evaluated on GD 10 (N 5 10–12 per
treatment) and half on GD 18 (N 5 10–11 per treatment).
EXPERIMENT 3: MULTIGENERATIONAL STUDY
To evaluate the persistence of ADBAC1DDAC teratogenic-
ity, NTDs were evaluated in mice moved to a facility using
chlorine dioxide disinfectant (Facility B) and compared to
animals remaining in Room A2. After a 10-day acclimation
period, mice in both colonies were bred to generate 15
pregnancies that were evaluated on GD 10 for the pres-
ence of NTDs. This evaluation of NTDs was repeated for
F1 and F2 generation animals born in Facility B. Although
the F0 generation was ambiently exposed to ADBAC1
DDAC while held in Room A2 before the move to Facility
B, none of the mice in this experiment were experimen-
tally dosed with ADBAC1DDAC.
EXPERIMENT 4: MALE AND FEMALE CHRONIC EXPOSURE STUDY
To
determine
whether
ADBAC1DDAC
caused
NTDs
through male or female exposure, a study was designed to
test pairings of exposed and unexposed mice. Fifteen
males and 45 females were transferred from Facility B (no
ambient exposure) to Room A1 (ambient exposure) and
dosed with 120 mg/kg/day ADBAC1DDAC in Nutragel diet
for 8 weeks. As a control, the same numbers of mice were
fed undosed gel diet for 8 weeks in Facility B. After 8
weeks, 10 dosed males and 30 dosed females were trans-
ferred back to Facility B and paired for breeding to gener-
ate the following five groups: 5 undosed males bred to 15
undosed females (UMUF), 5 undosed males bred to 15
dosed females (UMDF), 5 dosed males bred to 15 undosed
females (DMUF), 5 dosed males bred to 15 dosed females
(DMDF), and 5 dosed males bred to 15 dosed females
with
dosing
continuing
through
gestation
(DMDF1G).
Embryos were evaluated for NTDs on GD 10. To spread
the sampling schedule of pregnant mice, groups DMDF
and DMDF1G were delayed by 3 weeks from the start of
the other groups. In the 3 weeks between evaluating
embryos of the first three treatment groups and embryos
from DMDF and DMDF1G, the animal care staff discontin-
ued use of the ADBAC1DDAC disinfectant in Room A1 and
switched to chlorine dioxide disinfectant.
EXPERIMENT 5: MALE AND FEMALE ACUTE EXPOSURE STUDY
To clarify the contribution of paternal and maternal expo-
sure to NTDs, we conducted an additional male and female
exposure study, this time dosing by oral gavage. At 6 to 8
weeks of age, 10 male mice were dosed every other day
for 10 days with 30 mg/kg/day ADBAC1DDAC. After dos-
ing, the 10 males were bred with 30 unexposed females.
On GD 8, half of the pregnant females bred to the dosed
males were given a single oral gavage dose of 15 mg/kg
(DMDF), while the other 15 received saline (DMUF).
Simultaneously, 10 males received saline gavage every
other day for 10 days and were then bred to 30 females.
Fifteen pregnant females were transferred to Room A3 on
GD 3 and were dosed with 15 mg/kg ADBAC1DDAC on
GD 8 (UMDF). Fifteen pregnant females were dosed with
saline on GD 8 (UMUF). All dams were killed at GD 9.5
and
embryos
collected
and
evaluated
for
NTDs
as
described above.
EXPERIMENT 6: DOSED AND AMBIENT EXPOSURE STUDY
To clarify the contribution of ambient exposure on NTDs
in ADBAC1DDAC exposed mice, we compared NTDs in off-
spring of dosed mice with that of mice receiving only
ambient exposure to the disinfectant in the mouse room.
Ten males and 30 females were transferred from Facility B
to Facility C where they received ambient exposure from
ADBAC1DDAC disinfectant use in the mouse room for 10
days. In addition to the ambient exposure, 5 males were
dosed every other day for 10 days by oral gavage with
7.5 mg/kg ADBAC1DDAC. The mice were bred and the
dosed group females received a single gavage of 7.5 mg/kg
on GD 8. Five males and 15 females remained in Facility B
as controls and were gavaged with saline on the same
schedule as the dosed group. All dams were killed at GD
9.5 and embryos collected and evaluated for NTDs as
described above.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
All experiments were conducted with the mother as the
experimental unit; thus the N for each experiment is the
number of litters in a treatment group. All determinations
were averaged first per litter and then all litter values
were averaged by treatment. The NTD data and morpho-
metric data from GD 18 mouse fetuses were analyzed by
analysis of variance (ANOVA) (Statistix, Tallahassee, FL)
BIRTH DEFECTS RESEARCH 109:1166–1178 (2017)
1169
 followed by a Dunnett’s Multiple Comparison Test with
significance set at p < 0.05. Variance in fetal placental ratio
was evaluated by an F-Test based on litter averages in
each treatment with alpha set at 0.05.
Results
Initial findings at WSU suggested that QAC disinfectants
increased late fetal demise and altered pup numbers; addi-
tionally,
a
large
range
in
developmental
stage
was
observed
in
late
gestational
fetuses.
These
findings
prompted the following six experiments (numbered E1 to
E6) at VA Tech. The first experiment (E1) identified QAC
disinfectants as the likely cause of NTDs in both mice and
rats.
E2
demonstrated
a
dose
response
relationship
between disinfectant exposure and the formation of NTDs.
E3 revealed the persistence of a multigenerational effect
from QAC exposure. E4 and E5 demonstrated the contribu-
tion of ambient exposure on NTD formation and also
showed that either maternal of paternal exposure was suf-
ficient to induce NTDs in offspring. E6 demonstrated that
ambient use of the disinfectant in the mouse room was a
greater driver of NTD formation than dosing.
The appearance of NTDs originally coincided with the
switch to a disinfectant cleaner containing ADBAC1DDAC.
NTDs were located at the three closure sites described in
mice as shown in Figure 2 (Copp and Greene, 2013).
Incomplete closure of the rostral face at the rostral closure
site resulted in a split face lesion. In some individuals, the
entire face was split. Cranial lesions were observed at the
midbrain closure site and ranged in size from small to
large openings. Spinal lesions were observed mainly at the
hindbrain spinal boundary, but were also observed at
other locations along the spine.
Some embryos had multiple defects with incomplete
closure at two or more locations and some also exhibited
an abnormal phenotype, appearing compressed and mis-
shapen in the presence of an intact NT (Fig. 2).
After identifying the disinfectant as the possible terato-
gen, we created a “QAC free” room (A2) and raised rats
and mice for two generations and evaluated NTDs again

NEURAL TUBE DEFECTS FROM QAC EXPOSURE
 (E1). Both species exhibited significant declines in NTDs
after the move to Room A2 (Fig. 3). The prevalence was
higher in mice than in rats both before and after moving
to the “QAC free” environment, indicating a possible differ-
ence in species sensitivity. Concurrently, in E2 in which
embryos were evaluated from mothers dosed with 60 or
120 mg/kg/day disinfectant, we found significantly higher
levels of NTDs among the offspring of mothers dosed with
120 mg/kg/day (Fig. 4). However, in both E1 and E2, con-
trol mice displayed NTDs, suggesting continued environ-
mental exposure. Thus, although the correlation between
dose and the incidence of NTDs strongly suggested that
QACs were the cause of NTDs, the presence of NTDs in
controls prevented proof of concept.
To determine if the control mice in Room A2 were
being exposed inadvertently, we measured ADBAC residues
in the boxes of control and dosed mice. ADBAC could not
be detected in new unused boxes; however, residues were
present in all boxes that housed mice (Fig. 5). As expected,
mice dosed at 120 mg/kg/day had the highest residues of
ADBAC present in their boxes. Residues in boxes of control
mice from Room A2 were similar to those in boxes hous-
ing mice dosed at 60 mg/kg/day in Room A1. Control mice
in Room A2 were being inadvertently exposed despite our
best efforts to prevent it.
A similar experience occurred in Dr. Hunt’s laboratory
at WSU. In that instance, an entire “QAC-free” rodent facil-
ity became contaminated when a QAC dosing study was
initiated. The cage wash system was identified as the
source of contamination, spreading ADBAC1DDAC resi-
dues from experimental caging to clean boxes, and thus
exposing mice throughout the facility. Importantly, despite
the fact that the WSU facility did not use QAC disinfec-
tants, ADBAC1DDAC exposure from contaminated caging
was sufficient to reduce litter size. Litter sizes in nonex-
perimental mice decreased from an average of 9.2 pups
per litter to 8.2. The WSU study was immediately termi-
nated and litter sizes rebounded to 8.9 pups per litter the
following month.
The contamination events in both the WSU and VA
Tech studies highlight the necessity to isolate dosed and
FIGURE 3. Experiment 1: NTDs in GD 11 rat and GD 10 mouse embryos

tices and after being raised in a room using ethanol and chlorine dioxide.
NTDs were reduced after being removed from the ADBAC1DDAC environ-
ment (* indicates significant difference between the two rooms, ANOVA
p � 0.05). Values represent the mean 6 SEM percent per litter with N 5 20
rats and 13 mice in the QAC room, and N 5 9 rats and 9 mice in the QAC-
free room.
FIGURE 4. Experiment 2: NTDs in GD 10 mouse embryos dosed in the feed
with ADBAC1DDAC disinfectant for 8 weeks. The numbers of NTDs were sig-
nificantly greater in the 120 mg/kg/day exposed group compared with controls

resent the mean 6 SEM percent per litter with N 5 10 to 12 dams per

FIGURE 5. ADBAC residues detected in mouse boxes. ADBAC residues from
new or used mouse boxes were extracted with methanol and analyzed by liq-
uid chromatography with ultra violet detection. New boxes did not contain
ADBAC residues. Residues were detected in all used boxes. Residues in the
boxes of control mice (0 mg/kg/day) indicated inadvertent exposure in the
room. N 5 2 samples for each treatment. Each sample contained the residue
from five boxes. Each sample was run in duplicate and averaged.

 undosed mice. Housing control and exposed mice in sepa-
rate rooms within the same facility resulted in exposure of
controls at both institutions and was not sufficient. Once
control mice were removed from the facility that used
QAC disinfectants and the exposure was eliminated, the
negative control was re-established and NTDs were no
longer seen in control mice.
In addition to measuring NTDs in E2, we also eval-
uated late gestation fetuses on GD 18 from the same
cohort of mice. Both fetal weight and placental weights
were significantly reduced in 60 and 120 mg/kg/day
ADBAC1DDAC exposure groups compared to controls (Fig.
6); however, due to the inadvertent exposure of control lit-
ters described above, the effects of ADBAC1DDAC on fetal
and placental weights
may actually be
even greater.
Reduced fetal growth can be the result of placental insuffi-
ciency, therefore, the fetal–placental ratio was evaluated
(Fig. 7). There was no difference in the mean fetal placen-
tal ratio between control and treated mice; however, there
was a significant increase in the variance of the ratio at 60
and 120 mg/kg/day as demonstrated by the wider distri-
bution of ratios in dosed litters.
No gross malformations were observed in the GD 18
fetuses. Evaluation of the axial skeleton in clear stained
fetuses revealed few malformations (Table 2). Only lumbar
rib ossification centers on the right were significantly
increased with ADBAC1DDAC exposure. While lumbar rib
ossification centers without cartilage can increase with
environmental exposures, they are not considered malfor-
mations, but rather transient structures that likely become
incorporated into the lumbar transverse process (Chernoff
and Rogers, 2004). Fetal demise (total resorptions) was
increased to 17.1% at 120 mg/kg/day (Table 2). This was
not significantly different from controls, possibly due to
inadvertent exposure of control litters. Fetal demise in late
gestation (late resorptions) at 120 mg/kg/day was signifi-
cantly elevated at 12.4% compared with 3% in control lit-
ters. This increase in fetal death could be the reason why
no gross malformations were observed in the GD 18
fetuses.
To test the persistence of NTDs after the cessation of
exposure, in E3 we monitored NTDs in offspring for three
generations after animals were moved to a QAC-free facil-
ity (Facility B). As in E1, NTDs declined in the offspring of
F0 dams by comparison to the same cohort remaining in
Room A2 (Fig. 8). A further decline was evident in the off-
spring of F1 dams, and NTDs were not observed in the off-
spring of F2 dams. Because the F0 generation received
ambient exposure to disinfectant before the move to Facil-
ity B, this experiment demonstrates that ambient exposure
alone is sufficient to cause NTDs that persist for multiple
generations after cessation of exposure.
The role of maternal and paternal ADBAC1DDAC expo-
sure in the genesis of NTDs was evaluated in E4. NTDs
were observed in offspring when only males or only
females were dosed, as well as when both parents were
dosed (Fig. 9). Unexpectedly, levels of NTDs were lower
when both parents were dosed than when a single parent
was dosed and regardless of whether exposure ended
before mating or continued throughout mating and gesta-
tion. This finding was puzzling until we realized that the
animal care staff had discontinued use of the ADBAC1
DDAC disinfectant in Room A1 toward the end of our
study. For logistical reasons, groups with separately dosed
males and females were offset by 3 weeks from the groups
in which both parents were dosed. ADBAC1DDAC use in
the mouse room was discontinued in the 1-week interval

ence from control, ANOVA p � 0.05). Values represent the mean 6 SEM with

 after embryos from the single parent dose groups were
evaluated, but before the groups with both parents dosed
were paired for breeding. Although the change in environ-
mental exposure prevents direct comparison between
groups, the results of this study provide clear evidence
that either maternal or paternal exposure is sufficient to
induce NTDs. The results also provide further support that
ambient exposure significantly influences the rate of NTDs.
When maternal and paternal only exposure was reeval-
uated under consistent environmental conditions (E5),
NTDs were observed in all dosed groups and were highest
when both parents were exposed (Fig. 10), suggesting that
the effects of exposure are additive. In this experiment,
however, levels of NTDs did not reach significance when
only a single parent was dosed and, when both parents
were dosed, the incidence of NTDs was far lower than the
15% per litter observed in E1. The reduction in NTDs could
be due to the short-term dosing; males received five doses
prebreeding, while females received one dose on GD 8. In
previous studies, mice were dosed at higher concentrations
for 8 weeks in the diet. NTDs could also be lower in this
experiment because mice were no longer receiving ambient
exposure from ADBAC1DDAC disinfectant use in Room A3.

 To confirm that ambient exposure as a result of disin-
fectant use in the mouse room contributed significantly to
NTD formation, we moved mice for E6 to Facility C, a facil-
ity using ADBAC1DDAC disinfectants. Mice received ambi-
ent exposure
for 2
weeks
or ambient1gavage.
Both
ambient and ambient1gavage groups exhibited signifi-
cantly increased levels of NTDs compared with unexposed
controls (Fig. 11); however, the difference between mice
receiving ambient exposure and those receiving ambi-
ent1gavage was not significant. Importantly, despite the
fact that mice in E6 received a lower dose, the incidence
of NTDs was more than twice that seen in E5. These date
clearly demonstrate the important contribution of ambient
exposure in NTD formation.
Discussion
Previously, we demonstrated that ADBAC1DDAC exposure
causes reproductive toxicity in both male and female mice
(Melin et al., 2014, 2016). The present study describes
developmental toxicity in both mice and rats that mani-
fests as NTDs in early gestation and decreased pup size
and survivability in late gestation. NTDs were seen with
ADBAC1DDAC dosed acutely by oral gavage, chronically in
feed, and ambiently through the use of disinfectant in the
mouse room. Maternal and paternal toxicity was not
observed at the doses used in these experiments. A dose
effect was observed with both oral and ambient exposures;
increased exposure resulted in higher levels of NTDs.
While ambient exposure could not be quantified, the use
of ADBAC1DDAC disinfectant increased NTDs and contrib-
uted to exposure.
Every year in the United States, 150,000 to 200,000
babies (3.3–5.6% of live births) are born with a structural
birth defect. This figure increases to 17% to 20% of live
births when neurobehavioral and learning disabilities are
included (Boyle et al., 2011). NTDs are the second most
prevalent malformation after cardiac defects (Christianson
et al., 2006). In our studies, NTDs were seen in both rats
and
mice
following
ambient
exposure
to
the
QAC-
containing disinfectant in the mouse room. NTDs were
also observed in mice dosed with the disinfectant at 60 or
120 mg/kg/day in feed, or with ADBAC1DDAC chemical
by gavage at 7.5, 15, or 30 mg/kg/day. Thus, our data sug-
gest that malformations are induced at relatively low, envi-
ronmentally relevant doses.
ADBAC and DDAC are used extensively in household,
medical, and industrial settings, as well as in restaurants
and food production facilities. Over 1 million pounds each
of ADBAC and DDAC are manufactured in the United
States each year (PubChem Database). QAC disinfectants
are generally viewed as having low toxicity; and although
human deaths have been reported from accidental over-
dose, these events are rare (Chataigner et al., 1991; Ellen-
horn et al., 1997). Chronic exposure is known to cause
asthma and dermatitis (Bernstein et al., 1994; Suneja and
Belsito, 2008), as well as ocular inflammation and hyper-
sensitivity (Hong and Bielory, 2009). The separate ADBAC
and DDAC components have been tested for regulatory
purposes in reproductive and developmental toxicity stud-
ies in rats and rabbits, and were found to decrease fetal
weight at higher doses (Cosmetic Ingredient Review, 1989;
Tyl, 1989; Neeper-Bradley, 1990, 1993). These studies also
reported small litter size with an increase in resorptions
FIGURE 9. Experiment 4: The role of maternal and paternal ADBAC1DDAC
exposure on NTDs in GD 10 in offspring. One or both parents were dosed
with 120 mg/kg ADBAC1DDAC in the feed for 8 weeks. Mice were moved to
a non-QAC facility for breeding and gestation except one group that continued
exposure of both parents throughout breeding and gestation. NTDs were sig-
nificantly higher when only a single parent was dosed; however, husbandry
use of ADBAC1DDAC disinfectant was discontinued in between evaluation of
single parent and both parent groups. Removal of the ambient exposure likely
resulted in lower NTDs in the groups with both parents dosed. (* indicates

were significantly higher when both parents were dosed (* indicates signifi-

NEURAL TUBE DEFECTS FROM QAC EXPOSURE
 and late gestation fetal death (Cosmetic Ingredient Review,
1989; Tyl, 1989; Neeper-Bradley, 1993). Malformations
were not observed with the exception of one study that
found increased sternal abnormalities in benzalkonium
chloride exposed rat fetuses (Cosmetic Ingredient Review,
1989). Our study is the first to evaluate the developmental
toxicity of ADBAC1DDAC combination.
Before introduction of ADBAC1DDAC disinfectants in
the mouse room, the background rate for NTD malforma-
tions in our CD-1 embryos was approximately 1/1000
(Mallela et al., 2011). Following introduction of QAC disin-
fectants, ambient exposure resulted in 15% of embryos
and 100% of litters affected at GD 10. Early gestation
embryos were not evaluated in the regulatory studies dis-
cussed above; however, our results for GD 18 fetuses
showing decreased fetal weight, increased resorptions,
increased late gestational death, and few if any fetal mal-
formations, matched the findings of the regulatory studies
for the individual ADBAC and DDAC components (Cosmetic
Ingredient Review, 1989; Tyl, 1989; Neeper-Bradley, 1990,
1993).
Despite the NTDs observed in GD 10 embryos, we did
not see exencephaly in late gestation fetuses. This was
unexpected as NTDs are not lethal to the developing fetus.
It is possible that increased fetal death from ADBAC1
DDAC exposure could explain the lack of malformations in
GD 18 fetuses. The regulatory studies and previous studies
from our laboratory found increased resorptions and late
gestation fetal death (Cosmetic Ingredient Review, 1989;
Tyl, 1989; Neeper-Bradley, 1993; Melin et al., 2014, 2016).
In the present study, total resorptions were increased to
17.1% in 120 mg/kg/day litters which is close to the num-
ber of NTDs observed at GD 10. Total resorptions were
not statistically significant; however, late resorptions were
significantly higher at 120 mg/kg/day than controls. The
lack of significance with total resorptions could be due to
inadvertent exposure of controls. Total resorptions in con-
trol litters were 9.4% which is higher than the lab’s his-
toric rate of 5% (Hrubec et al., 2006b). A few treated
litters also exhibited 100% mortality as described previ-
ously in Melin et al. (2014, 2016); these litters were not
included in the analysis presented in this study as gesta-
tional stage could not always be determined. Additionally,
some exposed embryos exhibited an abnormal phenotype,
appearing compressed and misshapen. This could indicate
further toxicity that could be contributing to fetal demise
of affected fetuses. In aggregate, these studies clearly dem-
onstrate increased fetal death, particularly in late gesta-
tion, following ADBAC1DDAC exposure and could be a
reason for the lack of exencephaly in GD 18 fetuses.
An alternative explanation for lack of malformations in
late gestation fetuses is that the NTDs observed at GD 10
represent developmental delay. If so, then the open NT
would close if allowed to develop further. Both the Hrubec
and Hunt labs observed an increase in the range of devel-
opmental stages present within a litter and also an
increase in the number of runts born following ADBAC1D-
DAC exposure. This suggests dysregulation of temporal
events during development and the possibility for develop-
mental
delay.
While
only
age
appropriate
developed
embryos were analyzed, NT closure delay can occur in oth-
erwise normally developed embryos and some of the
NTDs could represent developmental delay. Delayed neural
tube closure is a cause for concern by itself; not only can
delay result in a NTD, it also indicates that normal devel-
opmental sequences in the central nervous system are
disrupted.
Altered timing of critical developmental events could
manifest as functional or behavioral defects in the adult.
Compounds associated with increased risk for NTDs, such
as valproic acid, carbamazepine, and polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons, also cause neurobehavioral disorders and
cognitive delay (Meador et al., 2007; Perera et al., 2012;
Wang et al., 2015). It is also possible that some form of
repair process is occurring during gestation that reduces
or eliminates the NTDs in GD 18 fetuses. Further studies
are needed to determine if some or all of the NT lesions
observed at GD 10 close over time, or whether affected
fetuses die later in gestation.
Decreased fetal weight was observed in this study
which could indicate direct developmental toxicity. Alter-
natively, decreased fetal growth can occur from a mis-
match between fetal and placental growth. If the placenta
is too small relative to the fetus, the fetus receives insuffi-
cient nutrition. Conversely, an overlarge placenta can
siphon nutrients away from the developing fetus and
result in reduced fetal growth. We observed significant
variation in the fetal placental ratio at both ends of the
FIGURE 11. Experiment 6: NTDs in mice exposed to ambient husbandry use

Males were dosed every other day for 10 days, and females were dosed once
on GD 8. NTDs were significantly higher than controls. There was no differ-
ence between mice receiving ambient or ambient1gavage exposure (* indi-
cates significant difference from controls, ANOVA p � 0.05). Values represent
the mean 6 SEM percent per litter, N 5 12 to 15 dams per treatment group.

 mismatch spectrum at both the 60 and 120 mg/kg/day
doses. This mismatch could also be contributing to the
increase in ADBAC1DDAC associated late gestation fetal
demise observed at both WSU and at VT (Melin et al.,
2014).
In human epidemiological studies, both small and large
placentas relative to birth weight have been associated
with fetal death and preterm deliveries (Haavaldsen et al.,
2013). Abnormal placenta-to-birth-weight ratio has been
associated with adult disease; specifically, disproportion-
ately large placentas relative to birth weight have been
associated with increased risk of death from cardiovascu-
lar disease (Risnes et al., 2009). Placental development is
orchestrated primarily through imprinted genes. The con-
flict hypothesis proposes that paternal genes enhance, and
maternal genes suppress, fetal growth. Imbalances in
expression of imprinted genes in the placenta are associ-
ated with restricted fetal or placental growth in both
humans and mice (Coan et al., 2005). The large variation
in fetal placenta ratio seen in ADBAC1DDAC treated litters
could be due to differences in epigenetic imprinting of pla-
cental genes; although further studies are needed to test
this possibility.
Alternatively, endocrine disrupting compounds, such as
bisphenol A and phthalates, alter mouse placental architec-
ture, size and function (Vrooman et al., 2016). Previously
we demonstrated that QACs alter normal reproductive
capabilities and estrus cycling in mice, thus acting as
endocrine disruptors (Melin et al., 2014, 2016). Changes
in placenta size and growth could be a result of altered
hormonal or endocrine signaling in the maternal/placen-
tal/fetal unit. Given the importance of the placenta to both
maternal and fetal health, the effects of QAC disinfectants
on the placenta should be studied further.
Perhaps the most important finding from this study
was the presence of NTDs following male only exposure.
Certain paternal occupations have been associated with an
increased risk for birth defects in offspring; however, epi-
demiological studies often could not identify the specific
exposure responsible (Trasler and Doerksen, 1999; Shaw
et al., 2002). More recently, epidemiological studies have
linked paternal exposures to classes of chemicals such as
polychlorinated compounds, pesticides, and organics such
as benzene, turpentine, diesel fuel, and creosote with an
increase in structural birth defects (reviewed by Braun
et al., 2017). Animal studies have found that paternal
exposure to alcohol, lead, or cyclophosphamide can result
in structural or behavioral abnormalities in the offspring
(reviewed by Curley et al., 2011; Anderson et al., 2014).
Male exposures can affect the offspring through genetic
or epigenetic mechanisms (Anway et al., 2005; Braun
et al., 2017). QACs are not mutagenic (EPA, 2006); thus, it
is likely they act through an epigenetic mechanism. Epige-
netic changes in the male germ line that are subsequently
passed on to the offspring provide a mechanism for male-
mediated teratogenesis. In this study, ADBAC1DDAC expo-
sure did not have to occur during breeding or gestation.
Male or female exposure that ended 7 to 10 days before
breeding was sufficient to cause NTDs. These results
emphasize the importance of considering both maternal
and paternal exposures when evaluating developmental
outcomes.
Equally important was the finding that ambient expo-
sure from use of disinfectant in the mouse room had a sig-
nificant
impact
on
NTD
formation.
Typically,
toxicity
assessments first evaluate high doses to demonstrate an
effect; after toxicity is demonstrated, the dose is reduced
to concentrations that are clinically or environmentally rel-
evant. This progression is often criticized because toxicity
is frequently first observed at unrealistically high concen-
trations. The data presented here demonstrate ADBAC1
DDAC caused NTDs at unrealistically high concentrations,
but also at ambient concentrations, from normal use of
the disinfectant in the mouse room.
The highest levels of NTDs were seen originally in
mice that had been bred and raised for multiple genera-
tions with ambient exposures (E1). When ADBAC1DDAC
disinfectant use was terminated in the middle of one
experiment (E4), the NTDs dropped significantly, despite
the fact that mice were being provided a high dose of
120 mg/kg/day. In the last two experiments, mice receiv-
ing a lower oral dose along with ambient exposure had
more NTDs than mice receiving a higher oral dose without
ambient exposure. Ambient use of the disinfectant likely
results in a combination of inhalation and oral exposure.
The fact that ambient exposure impacts NTDs to a greater
extent than oral dosing alone is not surprising. The Envi-
ronmental Protection Agency’s (EPA’s) risk assessment for
ADBAC and DDAC determined that inhalation exposure
carries a greater risk to human health than oral routes of
exposure (EPA, 2006). It is, however, sobering that ambi-
ent use of the disinfectant in the mouse room at the pre-
scribed rate of use caused NTDs in both rats and mice.
Collectively these results beg the serious question: Do
ADBAC and DDAC impact human development? Rodents
are used world-wide as surrogates to evaluate potential
human toxicity. The fact that we see developmental toxic-
ity in both rats and mice from exposure through normal
husbandry practices indicates a potential for human toxic-
ity. QAC use has increased significantly over time, and
products containing untested ADBAC1DDAC mixtures are
now commonplace (PubChem database). These changes
have modified the quantity and quality of human exposure.
The magnitude of production and variety of QAC contain-
ing products ensures that people are regularly and repeat-
edly exposed. Increased human exposure and the scarcity
of human data, coupled with observed rodent toxicity, all
advocate for immediate study of the effects of QACs expo-
sure on human health and development.
