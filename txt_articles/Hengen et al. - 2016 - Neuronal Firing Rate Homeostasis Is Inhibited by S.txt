In Brief
Neural circuits are stabilized by returning
firing rates to a set point that is specific to
individual neurons, but this process is
suppressed by sleep, raising the
possibility that decreased homeostatic
plasticity during sleep may promote
functions like learning and memory.

SUMMARY
Homeostaticmechanismsstabilizeneuralcircuitfunc-
tion by keeping firing rates within a set-point range,
but whether this process is gated by brain state is un-
known. Here, we monitored firing rate homeostasis in
individual visual cortical neurons in freely behaving
rats as they cycled between sleep and wake states.
When neuronal firing rates were perturbed by visual
deprivation, they gradually returned to a precise,
cell-autonomous set point during periods of active
wake, with lengthening of the wake period enhancing
firing rate rebound. Unexpectedly, this resetting of
neuronal firing was suppressed during sleep. This rai-
ses the possibility that memory consolidation or other
sleep-dependent processes are vulnerable to interfer-
ence from homeostatic plasticity mechanisms.
INTRODUCTION
Neocortical networks must generate and maintain stable activity
patterns despite perturbations induced by learning and experi-
ence-dependent plasticity, and this stability must be maintained
across distinct behavioral states with very different sensory drive
and modulatory tone. There is abundant theoretical and experi-
mental evidence that network stability is achieved through ho-
meostatic plasticity mechanisms that adjust synaptic and
neuronal properties to stabilize some measure of average activ-
ity (Turrigiano et al., 1998; Abbott and Nelson, 2000; Turrigiano
and Nelson, 2004). This process has been extensively studied
in primary visual cortex (V1), where chronic visual deprivation in-
duces an initial drop in activity (Kaneko et al., 2008; Mrsic-Flogel
et al., 2007, Keck et al., 2013) and ensemble average firing rates
(FRs) (Hengen et al., 2013), but over time activity is restored to
baseline despite continued deprivation. During this process it
is unknown whether individual neurons regulate firing around a
cell-autonomous set point or whether FR homeostasis is imple-
mented only at the network level (as in vitro work suggests; Slo-
mowitz et al., 2015). Further, it is unknown whether homeostatic
plasticity in vivo is gated in some way by behavioral state. To
address these questions, we followed FR homeostasis in individ-
ual V1 neurons in freely behaving animals during a 9-day visual
deprivation paradigm, as animals cycled between natural pe-
riods of sleep and wake.
The role of sleep and wake states in the induction of neocortical
plasticity remains controversial. Cortical activity patterns, sen-
sory drive, modulatory tone, and induction of plasticity all differ
between sleep and wake (Frank and Cantera, 2014; Steriade
and Timofeev, 2003; Jones, 2005). We showed previously
that FR homeostasis restores ensemble average firing when
measured during sleep or wake (Hengen et al., 2013), indicating
that once homeostatic adjustments have occurred, they serve
to stabilize the same network across these distinct internal
states. However, this study did not address whether the induction
of homeostatic plasticity might be confined to sleep or wake. An
influential theory, the synaptic homeostasis hypothesis (SHY),
asserts that Hebbian synaptic potentiation during waking in-
creases FRs, and homeostatic mechanisms then restore FRs to
baseline during subsequent sleep (Tononi and Cirelli, 2014).
The SHY hypothesis thus makes the strong prediction that FR ho-
meostasis will only be observed during sleep (Tononi and Cirelli,
2014). In contrast, another influential theory about the function of
sleep, the sleep replay hypothesis (Abel et al., 2013), is agnostic
about when FR homeostasis should occur. Although a number of
experiments have been undertaken to test SHY (Frank and Can-
tera, 2014; Tononi and Cirelli, 2014), the key prediction of this hy-
pothesis—that FR homeostasis triggered by a perturbation to the
circuit should occur only during sleep—has never been tested.
Here, we track firing of individual V1 neurons over many days
during the induction of homeostatic plasticity. We find that pro-
longed monocular deprivation (MD) first depresses the firing of
individual V1 neurons, but FRs then return precisely to the neu-
ron’s own baseline despite continued deprivation, indicating
that neocortical neurons in vivo regulate firing around an individ-
ual set point. Further, we find that FR homeostasis is indeed
gated by sleep/wake states, but the relationship is opposite of
what has been proposed (Tononi and Cirelli, 2014): sleep in-
hibits, rather than promotes, FR homeostasis. Thus, it is the
waking brain state that enables the expression of homeostatic
plasticity. This exclusion of FR homeostasis from sleep states
raises the intriguing possibility that memory consolidation or
some other sleep-dependent process (Ji and Wilson, 2007;
Wang et al., 2011) is vulnerable to interference from homeostatic
plasticity mechanisms.

 (V1m), in which activity is suppressed over the first 2 days
through the induction of LTD and other depressive mechanisms
(Smith et al., 2009); the consequent reduction in firing then acti-
vates a set of homeostatic plasticity mechanisms that restore
firing to baseline over the next several days (Hengen et al.,
2013; Keck et al., 2013; Mrsic-Flogel et al., 2007; Kaneko
et al., 2008). To follow this process as it unfolds, we recorded
extracellular signals continuously from both hemispheres of
V1m in freely behaving animals for 9 days, beginning at P24,
with MD commencing at P26. This paradigm allowed us to
compare activity from the deprived and control hemispheres of
V1m from the same animals. To identify individual cells we could
follow throughout the experiment, we conducted principal com-
ponents analysis (PCA)-based clustering on the entire dataset
from each electrode channel (2–60 million spikes/channel) (Fig-
ures 1A and 1B). Single units were identified based on statistical
measures of cluster quality and isolation (L-ratio, Mahalanobis
distance, isolation), as well as the presence of an absolute
refractory period, and regular spiking units (RSUs, �90% pyra-
midal) were identified based on waveform and spiking character-
istics as described (Hengen et al., 2013; Cardin et al., 2007; Niell
and Stryker, 2008). We considered single units identified in this
way to be continuously recorded if spikes within the cluster
were present for at least 80% of the 9-day recording period, as
described in the Experimental Procedures and Supplemental
Experimental Procedures (Figure S1). All data and analysis re-
ported here are from RSUs.
A subset (approximately half) of RSUs, 4–15 units/16 channel
array, could be continuously recorded, and the fraction of neu-
rons that were ‘‘lost’’ during the experiment was similar for the
control and deprived hemispheres (chi-square test, p = 0.51).
PCA-based clustering showed that these RSUs remained
distinguishable throughout the recordings (Figure 1A), and the
centroid of clusters and the spike waveforms varied little across
days (Figures 1B–1D and S2). To quantify this stability, we pro-
duced peak-scaled average waveforms from each unit for
each day (24 hr) of the recording, calculated the summed square
error (SSE) of all possible comparisons between these average
waveforms across days, and compared this to the error for
randomly shuffled (peak normalized) units; the mean SSE was
�5-fold lower for continuously recorded RSUs (p < 0.0001,
n = 99 neurons; Figure 1E).
Due to the duration of these recordings, we were able to isolate
sparsely firing units that, for shorter recordings, would not have
generated enough spikes to constitute a robust cluster. As a
result, and consistent with prior evidence, V1m RSUs hadaverage
FRs that varied over many orders of magnitude (Hroma
´ dka et al.,
2008; O’Connor et al., 2010; Roxin et al., 2011), from as slow as
0.02 Hz to as fast as 20 Hz (Figures 1F and 3E). Despite this
impressive range of average FRs, for individual neurons under
control conditions average FRs remained remarkably stable
throughout these long recordings (Figures 1F and 3C–3E).
Average FRs Are Stable across Behavioral States
The stability of V1m FRs over many days in freely behaving ani-
mals (Figures 1F and 3E) raises the question of whether average
firing is modulated by behavioral state or environmental factors.
The reported effects of sleeping and waking on neocortical firing
properties in freely behaving animals have been inconsistent,
with some studies finding little effect on average firing (Evarts
et al., 1962; Aton et al., 2009; Hengen et al., 2013) and others re-
porting differences of 25% or more (Aba
´ solo et al., 2015; Ster-
iade et al., 2001; Sullivan et al., 2014); generally these studies
either followed the same neurons across very few epochs of
each state or followed different ensembles across many epochs.
Here, we were able to compare the firing properties of the same
neurons across many iterations of sleep and wake.
To differentiate wake and sleep states, we performed poly-
somnography using local field potentials, electromyogram
(EMG), and video recordings to separate activity into epochs of
sleep (rapid eye movement, REM; and slow-wave, non-REM;
sleep), as well as epochs of quiet and active wake (Figure 2A;
Frank et al., 2001). As expected (Witting et al., 1993), animals
slept more in the light (�7/12 hr) than the dark (�5/12 hr) (Figures
S3C–S3F), and in both phases cycled between many brief bouts
of sleep and wake, with the average bout length being 17.98 ±
0.55 min and 18.21 ± 0.67 min, respectively. Consistent with a
previous report (Hengen et al., 2013), when FRs of individual neu-
rons were normalized and averaged, there was no difference be-
tween states, although there was a non-significant trend toward
slower rates during NREM (ANOVA = 0.08; Figures 2B and S3A).
Further, average firing was not strongly modulated by light or
dark (Figures 2D and S3B); while this may seem counterintuitive,
it is consistent with previous data from rodent V1 (Fiser et al.,
2004). Although state transitions produced small differences in
the spike amplitudes of individual neurons, spike waveforms
remained constant and single units remained distinguishable in
Eigenspace across different behavioral states (Figure S4).
To further analyze the effects of state on FR, we plotted the
average firing of individual neurons during one state against their
firing in another (Figure 2E); values clustered around the unity line
for active versus quiet wake and for wake (active and quiet)
versus sleep (REM and non-REM), indicating little difference in
the average behavior of individual neurons as they transition be-
tween these states (Figure 2E). In contrast, the same analysis for
non-REM and REM states showed considerable variability in the
behavior of the same individual neurons, with a subset of neu-
rons showing higher rates during REM, as reported previously
(Evarts et al., 1962; Rudolph et al., 2007). Finally, although
average FRs between Sleep and Wake were not significantly
different, the coefficient of variation (CV) of firing was signifi-
cantly higher in the two waking states (Figure 2C), and this
agrees with some previous data (Evarts et al., 1962; but see
Scho
¨ olvinck et al., 2015). These data show that despite differ-
ences in the pattern (Figure 2A) and variance (Figure 2C) of activ-
ity, the mean (set point) FRs of RSUs in V1 are largely indepen-
dent of behavioral state.
Neocortical Neurons Have an Individual FR Set Point
Two distinct mechanisms could account for previous descrip-
tions of FR homeostasis in cortical networks. First, largely cell-
autonomous plasticity mechanisms could generate an individual
FR set point for each neuron, where this set-point value can vary
widely (Figures 1F and 3). Alternatively, the FR of individual neu-
rons may be free to move within the distribution as long as both
the ensemble average and the distribution of FRs (Hengen et al.,
Cell 165, 180–191, March 24, 2016 ª2016 Elsevier Inc.
181
 2013) is maintained. While in vitro data have supported this later
possibility (Slomowitz et al., 2015), the answer in intact neocor-
tical networks is unknown.
To distinguish between these possibilities, we examined the
FRs of individual neurons during the process of FR homeostasis.

(A) PCA clustering of spike waveforms from a single electrode across 9 days of recording. A subset of points is shown for clarity. On this wire, two clusters were
identified algorithmically as separable single units (labeled by the pink/yellow spectrum and blue/purple spectrum). Points within a cluster are colored according
to the day the spike was acquired. WavePC1 and WavePC2 are the first two principal components of waveforms. WaveFFT is a weighted sum of the fast Fourier
transform of waveforms.
(B) Cluster centroids were calculated and color-coded for each day of recording and overlaid on the cluster projections shown in (A).
(C) Mean waveform trace per 24 hr of recording was calculated for each of the two clusters and color-coded as in (A).
(D) Mean waveform traces in (C) are peak scaled and overlaid to demonstrate stability of waveforms for cells 1 and 2.
(E) The sum of squared errors (SSE) for each continuous unit was calculated for all possible comparisons of the nine waveforms, averaged across continuous
units, and plotted (continuous). This was compared to the SSE obtained when waveforms from continuous units were randomly shuffled and reassigned to mock
units (random pairs).

 induces a drop in V1 ensemble average firing in the deprived
hemisphere that reaches a nadir on the second day of depriva-
tion (i.e., MD2); FRs then slowly return to baseline over the
next several days (Hengen et al., 2013). Here, we used this para-
digm to examine the behavior of individual neurons as FRs
rebound (Figures 3A and 3B). Individual neurons in the deprived
hemisphere showed the same drop and rebound as reported
previously for the ensemble average (Hengen et al., 2013), with
some variability in the time course from neuron to neuron (Fig-
ure 3A). When individual FRs were normalized to baseline and
averaged across animals (n = 44), the same pattern was
apparent: firing dropped by �60% by the end of MD2 (early
MD) and then returned to baseline by MD5-6 (late MD;
Figure 3B).
Many individual neurons appeared to return very closely to
their own baseline firing by late MD (Figure 3A). To quantify this
behavior across the entire population of continuously recorded
neurons from the deprived hemisphere, we first plotted the FR
of each neuron during the baseline period against its FR during
early MD. This revealed that neurons were clustered around
the unity line in the control hemisphere, while neurons in the
deprived hemisphere were clustered below the unity line, indi-
cating depression of firing across the population (Figure 3C;
here and below control n = 35 neurons from five animals, and
deprived n = 44 neurons from six animals). In contrast, when
baseline firing was plotted against firing during late MD, both
control and deprived neurons were clustered around the unity
line, indicating that FRs of deprived neurons had increased

 across the population and were statistically indistinguishable
from control values (Figure 3D). To determine how closely indi-
vidual neurons returned to their own baseline, we calculated
the percent difference between initial and final FRs for each
neuron and then averaged these values for early and late MD.
Despite the huge range of initial FRs, deprived neurons returned
to within (on average) �15% of their baseline, measured 6 days
earlier (Figure 3D, inset). Notably, this difference was similar for
control neurons followed over the same time period (Figure 3D,
inset; deprived not different from control, p = 0.72).
To probe this further, we plotted the cumulative distribution of
average FRs for baseline, early MD, and late MD for both control
(Figure 3E) and deprived (Figure 3F) neurons; neurons were co-
lor-coded by their initial position in the distribution (during base-
line). The distribution for neurons from the control hemisphere
did not shift significantly during either early or late MD (Figure 3E;
p < 0.11), whereas for the deprived hemisphere the distribution
shifted to the left during early MD (p < 0.03) and shifted back
to overlay the control distribution by late MD (Figure 3F;
p = 0.60). Control neurons appeared to change their order in
the distribution little over time; to quantify this, we calculated
the change in rank order of individual neurons between baseline
and early or late MD. Deprived neurons changed their order in
the distribution more during early MD than did control neurons
(Figure 3F, inset; p < 0.003), but by late MD they had returned
closer to their original order and were not different from control
(p = 0.99). Taken together, these data show that, in contrast to
what has been reported in culture (Slomowitz et al., 2015),
neocortical neurons in vivo return quite precisely to an individual
FR set point.
FR Homeostasis Is Gated by Sleep/Wake States
During the process of FR homeostasis, animals cycle between
many brief bouts of sleep and wake, allowing us to ask whether
or not FR homeostasis occurs continuously regardless of state
(Figures 4A and 4B). We began by calculating the average
change in firing across each epoch type—REM, non-REM, quiet
wake, and active wake—during the rebound period (late MD2-
late MD5). For each neuron, we extracted all epochs of a given
state during the rebound period (Figure 4C, in this example,
Active wake, colored boxes), expressed time as the percent of
time in epoch (to normalize epochs of different lengths), normal-
ized the FR, and then averaged firing across all epochs (Fig-
ure 4D). Values were averaged across all control (Figure 4E,
n = 35) or all deprived (Figure 4F, n = 44) neurons for each of
the four states. For control neurons, there was little change
across any epoch type, consistent with overall FR stability in
the control hemisphere (Figures 1F and 3E). Surprisingly, for
deprived neurons the increase in firing was not evenly distributed
across states but instead occurred primarily during Active wake
(Figure 4F). Further, when the fold change across epoch types
was averaged and plotted for control and deprived neurons,
only the Active wake condition was significantly different be-
tween control and deprived (Figure 4G; p < 0.05). To confirm
that this result was not influenced by our inclusion of only
RSUs that could be followed for 9 days, we performed the
same analysis on all single units from the deprived hemisphere
that could be detected during the rebound period (116
RSUs from six animals). The results were consistent with those
obtained
from
continuously
recorded
neurons:
the
only
condition in which FRs changed significantly was Active wake
(Figure S5C).
The rebound in firing spans several L/D cycles. To determine
whether the increase in firing during Active wake epochs was
modulated by environmental factors, such as L/D or Zeitgeber
time, we next divided the Active wake epochs into those occur-
ring during either the L or the D phase. The firing of deprived neu-
rons increased across Active wake epochs from both the L and D
phases (Figure 4H), suggesting that the wake-driven increase in
firing is largely independent of circadian cycle or other environ-
mental factors.
While the average length of sleep and wake epochs is
�18 min, there is a broad distribution of epoch durations, ranging
from <1 min to several hours (Figure 5A). If FR homeostasis hap-
pens continuously during each active waking epoch, longer
epochs should reveal a greater increase in FRs. To analyze
this, we divided epochs from the rebound period into quintiles
by length and plotted the average epoch length for each quintile
against the fold change in firing. The activity of deprived neurons
was stable across even the longest REM or non-REM epochs
(Figure 5B; one-way ANOVA, p > 0.90). For quiet wake, there
was a non-significant trend for firing to increase during longer
epochs; finally, for Active wake the increase in firing was signif-
icantly larger for longer epochs (Figure 5C; p = 0.007). This
was confirmed through an independent analysis by sliding a
6-hr window across the data and examining the correlation be-
tween the percent time spent awake and the change in firing;
during rebound, there was a significant positive correlation for
deprived, but not control, neurons (Figure S6; p < 0.05).
To directly test whether the length of active waking epochs
modulates the amount of FR rebound, we used a gentle handling
paradigm (Kopp et al., 2006; Meerlo et al., 2008; Colavito et al.,
2013) to extend the length of spontaneously occurring waking
epochs during 24 hr of the rebound period. To avoid stress
due to cumulative sleep deprivation, we extended the length of
every other natural waking epoch to 1 hr and then allowed the an-
imal to sleep, wake, and sleep normally before extending the
next waking epoch (Figure 5D). We compared extended waking
epochs (�1-hr duration) to interspersed natural waking epochs
(4.6 min ± 0.8 s duration). Consistent with our data showing
that the amount of rebound is correlated with the length of natu-
ral waking epochs (Figure 5C), we found that extended waking
increased the amount of FR rebound in neurons from the
deprived hemisphere (n = 24 neurons from three animals,
p = 0.0013 compared to control hemisphere), while interspersed
natural waking bouts, whose duration was comparable to the
second shortest quintile of distribution times (Figure 5C), had
no effect on firing (p = 0.78).
Some studies (Vyazovskiy et al., 2008, 2009), but not others
(Grosmark et al., 2012), have observed an increase in firing
across waking epochs. Our analyses of control neurons did not
reveal such an increase (Figures 4E and 5E); to determine if
such an effect might be apparent for long epochs of wake or
sleep, we identified 4-hr periods during the rebound that were
either sleep- or wake-dense, meaning animals were asleep or
awake for >65% of the epoch (Figure 6A; Vyazovskiy et al.,

 2009). There was considerable variability in the behavior of neu-
rons; when the change in firing across these wake- or sleep-
dense periods for an ensemble of neurons was examined, indi-
vidual epochs could result in a net increase, a net decrease, or
no net change in firing (Figure 6B). When this behavior was quan-
tified and averaged for all such wake- and sleep-dense epochs
for control neurons, there was neither a net change in firing dur-
ing these long wake-dense episodes nor a decrease in firing dur-
ing sleep (Figure 6C, n = 10 wake and 37 sleep episodes). In
contrast, for deprived neurons during the rebound period, there

was an increase in firing during wake-
dense (p < 0.05), but not sleep-dense, ep-
isodes (Figure 6C, n = 23 wake and 34
sleep episodes).
These data show a selective increase in
firing during Active waking epochs during
the homeostatic rebound phase of MD.
The above analysis does not preclude
the possibility that abrupt increases in
firing at transitions between states also
contribute to the FR rebound. To examine
this, we measured changes in FR during
state transitions, by comparing the FR
during the last 30 s of one state to the
FR during the first 30 s of the next state (Figure 7A). We confined
this analysis to behaviorally relevant state transitions (defined as
those that made up >5% of all transitions). This analysis revealed
little sign of discontinuities in firing between states and no differ-
ences between control and deprived neurons (Figures 7B and
7C, n = 35 control and 44 deprived neurons). These data indicate
that the rebound in firing in the deprived hemisphere cannot be
accounted for by abrupt increases in firing during transitions be-
tween vigilance states. Thus, FR homeostasis is driven by an in-
crease in firing during active wake epochs.

 DISCUSSION
In this study we follow the firing of identified neocortical neurons
as they undergo homeostatic plasticity in freely behaving ani-
mals in order to answer two key questions: whether neurons
have an individual FR set point around which their average firing
is regulated, and whether the plasticity mechanisms that drive
this process are gated by the behavioral state of the animal.
We find that, even though the average FR of regular spiking
(�90% pyramidal) neurons in V1 can differ by several orders of
magnitude, each neuron maintains its average firing around an
individual set point and returns very precisely to this set point
when firing is perturbed by visual deprivation. Surprisingly, we
also find that FR homeostasis in vivo is induced intermittently,

during periods when the animal is awake
and active. Thus, this critical form of brain
plasticity is suppressed during sleep and
works to restore network stability only
during waking states.
There is strong evidence that neocor-
tical pyramidal neurons in vivo express a
cell-autonomous form
of homeostatic
plasticity, synaptic scaling (Desai et al.,
2002; Goel and Lee, 2007; Maffei and
Turrigiano, 2008; Lambo and Turrigiano,
2013), and that synaptic scaling contrib-
utes to the recovery in firing during pro-
longed MD (Hengen et al., 2013; Keck
et al., 2013; Kaneko et al., 2008; Toyoi-
zumi et al., 2014). Thus, the simplest
explanation for how individual FRs are
precisely restored during FR homeo-
stasis is that this process is driven pre-
dominately by cell-autonomous plasticity
mechanisms and that there is a broad dis-
tribution of individual FR set points across
neocortical neurons. Our data agree with previous findings that
neocortical neurons have a wide distribution of mean firing rates
(Hroma
´ dka et al., 2008; O’Connor et al., 2010; Roxin et al., 2011),
but go further to suggest that this distribution is actively main-
tained by homeostatic mechanisms that regulate mean firing
around cell-autonomous set points. Interesting and open ques-
tions are why neocortical neurons have such a wide range of
firing rate set points and how these set points are constructed
at the cellular level.
Hebbian (correlation-based) plasticity and homeostatic plas-
ticity cooperate to refine neocortical circuitry, but how they
interact is unclear. In particular, it is unknown whether they can
operate simultaneously during experience-dependent plasticity
or whether they must be temporally segregated from one
Cell 165, 180–191, March 24, 2016 ª2016 Elsevier Inc.
187
 another to avoid interference. It has been suggested that Heb-
bian plasticity occurs primarily during waking when animals are
actively sampling their environment, while homeostatic plasticity
occurs during sleep when brain activity is disconnected from
ongoing experiences (Tononi and Cirelli, 2014). Possible reasons
to segregate the two forms of plasticity is potential interference
due to activation of overlapping signaling cascades (Vitureira
and Goda, 2013) or competition for control over postsynaptic
strength parameters (Toyoizumi et al., 2014). Despite these theo-
retical considerations, there has been little direct evidence for or
against the notion that homeostatic plasticity is gated by sleep.
Supposed molecular correlates of Hebbian and homeostatic
plasticity vary with sleep and wake (Cirelli et al., 2004), but it is
difficult to map these global changes onto specific plasticity
mechanisms within neocortical circuits (Nelson and Turrigiano,
2008).
The most direct evidence for sleep-driven homeostatic plas-
ticity is that the frequency (but not amplitude) of miniature excit-
atory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) was higher in brain slices
harvested from animals during the dark phase (wake-dense)
than during the light phase (sleep-dense; Liu et al., 2010); how-
ever, the relationship between changes in mEPSC frequency
and synaptic strength is unclear, and neocortical synaptic
scaling is generally reported to affect mEPSC amplitude (and
thus postsynaptic strength) rather than mEPSC frequency (Turri-
giano, 2012). A similar experimental paradigm was used to show
that neocortical FRs were higher after a wake-dense period and
lower after a sleep-dense period, consistent with the idea that
net synaptic potentiation during wake drives an increase in firing,

Figure 6. Baseline Firing Is Stable during
Long Sleep and Wake Episodes
(A) We identified 4-hr periods that were sleep or
wake dense (>65% sleep or wake) and quantified
changes in firing for control neurons or deprived
neurons during the rebound period. An area plot
from one animal displaying the distribution of sleep
and wake across a 24-hr period is shown. Example
sleep dense and wake dense blocks are identified
in the gray boxes (blocks start at time ‘‘t’’ and end
at ‘‘t+4’’).
(B) Sleep and wake dense periods did not have
consistent effects on the FRs of ensembles of
single units in the control hemisphere. Example
blocks demonstrate that both wake and sleep
dense blocks could exhibit increasing rates, no net
change, and decreasing rates.
(C) Quantification of FR changes averaged across
all sleep- or wake-dense blocks. In control condi-
tions (filled), firing is stable across both sleep- and
wake-dense blocks of time. During MD, in the
deprived hemisphere (open), FRs increased only in
wake-dense periods.
See also Figure S6.
while net synaptic downscaling during
sleep drives a decrease in firing (Vyazov-
skiy et al., 2009). In contrast, here we
find no net change in firing across wake
or sleep under baseline conditions. The
root cause of this difference is unclear, but could be due to brain
region or other methodological differences. Our data argue
against the notion that simply being awake in a familiar environ-
ment is sufficient to drive Hebbian potentiation of synapses and
an increase in FRs.
The strongest test of whether homeostatic plasticity is gated
by behavioral state is to provide a perturbation sufficient to
trigger homeostatic compensation and then determine when
this compensation occurs. We used a firmly established para-
digm (monocular deprivation) to first depress FRs and then
continuously monitored the process of FR homeostasis over
the next several days as FRs returned to baseline. Surprisingly,
the expression of homeostasis was neither continuous nor did
it emerge during sleep as the SHY hypothesis predicts. Instead,
we found that FRs were stable during sleep and increased signif-
icantly only during epochs of active wake. Longer active wake
epochs induced more homeostatic compensation, as did artifi-
cially extending the length of wake epochs. Recordings from
the control hemisphere (where FRs were stable) showed that
the same behavioral state changes had no effect on the FRs of
neurons whose activity had not been depressed. Although the in-
crease in firing occurs during active wake epochs, when aver-
aged across many hours of recording FRs are not different be-
tween sleep and wake even during the rebound phase of MD
(Hengen et al., 2013). This is because sleep and wake epochs
are short and interspersed, so each increase in firing that hap-
pens during a wake epoch will also elevate activity during the
next sleep epoch. Our data show that, during FR homeostasis,
FRs rise slightly during each epoch of active waking, and this
188
Cell 165, 180–191, March 24, 2016 ª2016 Elsevier Inc.
 increase in firing is then maintained during subsequent epochs of
REM and non-REM sleep but does not increase further until the
next epoch of active waking. Thus, the cellular and circuit
changes that drive the homeostatic increase in firing are able
to keep firing elevated across distinct behavioral states.
How active waking enables FR homeostasis is unclear, but one
possibility is that a change in neuromodulatory tone specific to
the active waking state (Constantinople and Bruno, 2011; Ster-
iade et al., 1993) is permissive for the expression of homeostatic
plasticity. Alternatively, it could be that vascular changes during
sleep (Xie et al., 2013) suppress FR homeostasis by washing
out some permissive diffusible factor (such as TNF alpha; Stein-
metz and Turrigiano, 2010; Stellwagen and Malenka, 2006; Ka-
neko et al., 2008). While it is not clear whether active waking en-
ables FR homeostasis or sleep suppresses it, the fact that FR
homeostasis was largely excluded from REM, non-REM, and
quiet waking suggests the former possibility is the most likely.
Homeostatic plasticity is thought to be a slow, transcription-
dependent process (Goold and Nicoll, 2010; Ibata et al., 2008),
so it is quite surprising that it can be turned off and on in a matter
of minutes. It is possible that we only see significant compensa-
tion during longer waking epochs because of the time-depen-
dence of activating a transcription-dependent process, although
this timescale (�10 min) is still quite rapid for turning on and off
transcription (Flavell and Greenberg, 2008). Alternatively, it could
be that the induction mechanisms underlying homeostatic
compensation are continuously turned on when FRs are per-
turbed from the set point and plasticity is gated at the level of
the expression mechanism(s). For example, the final step in the
expression of synaptic scaling up is the enhanced accumulation
of synaptic glutamate receptors (Gainey et al., 2009); it is
possible that homeostatic plasticity is gated at this final step,
such that the receptor accumulation process is primed but
enabled only during the active waking state.
It seems unlikely that expression of homeostatic plasticity is
excluded from sleep because all forms of Hebbian plasticity
must be temporally segregated from all forms of homeostatic
plasticity. While some forms of plasticity within V1 require sleep
for their expression (Aton et al., 2013, 2014), LTP and LTD-like
mechanisms are also likely to be driven by changes in visual
experience during active exploratory states (Sawtell et al.,
2003; Nelson and Turrigiano, 2008), where our data show they
would be co-active with homeostatic mechanisms. The exclu-
sion of FR homeostasis from sleep instead raises the possibility
that homeostatic plasticity interferes with a process exclusive to
sleep (Abel et al., 2013).
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
All surgical techniques and experimental procedures were conducted in
accordance with the Brandeis University IACUC and NIH guidelines.
In Vivo Data Collection and Spike Sorting
Extracellular recordings, experimental design, and data collection were as
described previously (Hengen et al., 2013); additionally, bilateral EMG wires
were implanted deep in the nuchal muscle. Data were collected continuously
for 9 days from 11 juvenile Long-Evans rats of both sexes. 3 days of baseline
activity were collected prior to a 6-day MD protocol.
Waveforms were identified via a threshold method (�4 SD), and individual
spike characteristics were quantified for dimensionality reduction (MClust
[v.4.3], A.D. Redish, http://redishlab.neuroscience.umn.edu/MClust/MClust.
html). These characteristics were then passed to a clustering algorithm (Harris
et al., 2000). Researchers were blind to experimental condition during all spike
sorting and related analyses.
Briefly, we considered a cell to be continuously recorded when (1) clustering
data from the entire experiment yielded a single unit, (2) biophysical properties
were consistent with single units (i.e., refractory period), (3) spike shapes were
uniform across the experiment (Figures 1D and 1E), and (4) the signal-to-noise
ratio was consistently high. We used rate and SSE to determine when a cell
was ‘‘lost’’ (Figures S1A and S1B). Both methods revealed the same results
(Figures 4F, S5A, S5B, and S5E).

deprived conditions (including those not plotted).

 Polysomnography
Arousal state was manually scored using custom software (MATLAB). Briefly,
the LFP spectral power (0.3–15 Hz) was extracted from three channels across
two hemispheres and averaged. EMG signals were band-pass filtered (10–
200 Hz). EMG and LFP data were synchronized with video recordings, and
researchers identified state transitions using standard guidelines (Coleman
et al., 2004).
Analysis of FRs within Epochs
Spike times of neurons were divided into discrete epochs of behavioral state.
Activity during each epoch was separated into 100 bins to normalize time and
then normalized to its own activity in the first 25% of a given epoch (such that
each epoch for each neuron started at 1.0). All epochs of a given state were
then averaged for each neuron, and all neurons were then averaged within a
condition (i.e., control, rebound).
Extended Waking
Natural waking epochs were extended to 1 hr between ZT0 on MD3 and ZT0
on MD4, using a gentle handling paradigm. Animals were monitored for natu-
rally occurring wake epochs, and then gentle interventions were used to
extend every other wake epoch to 60 min. Animals were allowed to sleep in
between extended and natural wake epochs.
Statistics
The data are reported as mean ± SEM for the number of neurons or animals
indicated, unless otherwise noted. Statistical tests were as follows. One-way
single-factor ANOVA followed by a post hoc Tukey test was used for
comparing multiple means. For paired data (i.e., the same cell, or the same an-
imal ensemble average, compared at different times), paired t tests were used.
For data that were not clearly normally distributed, the non-parametric Mann-
Whitney U test was used. For all tests with multiple comparisons, a Bonferroni
correction was used. To compare cumulative distributions, a Kolmogorov-
Smirnov test was used. Statistical significance was considered to be
p < 0.05, unless otherwise noted.
