 Despite federal legalisation of abortion in the USA in 1973,
women’s right to choose abortion has been hotly debated,
factoring heavily into the broader political landscape. Paralleling
political division at the societal level, there has been considerable
debate among academics regarding the extent to which abortion
poses serious mental health risks to women. Over the past several
decades, hundreds of studies have been published indicating
statistically significant associations between induced abortion
and adverse psychological outcomes of various forms.1–4 However,
the authors of the three most recent qualitative literature reviews
arrived at the conclusion that abortion does not pose serious risks
above those associated with unintended pregnancy carried to
term.5–7 This conclusion is problematic for several reasons, the
most salient of which are described briefly below.
First, only a handful of studies have actually included
unintended pregnancy carried to term as a control group. Pregnancy
intendedness is not well defined in the literature and basic con-
ceptualisation and measurement issues challenge the validity of
the intendedness variable as used in the available studies. Specifically,
pregnancies that are terminated are sometimes initially intended by
one or both partners and pregnancies that are initially unintended
may become wanted as the pregnancy progresses, rendering assess-
ment of intendedness subject to considerable change over time.
In
addition,
pregnancy
intendedness
is
typically
measured
dichotomously (intended/ unintended) when true responses may
actually fall on a continuum from fully intended and planned for
years to entirely unintended, with a great deal of variation likely
between these two extremes. At least half of all pregnancies in the
USA are classified as unintended and among adolescents and
women over 40 years old the percentage is over 75%,8,9 meaning
the majority of women in the control groups in studies comparing
abortion with term pregnancy actually delivered unintended
pregnancies even if the variable was not directly assessed.
Second, many recently published studies with extensive
controls for third variables were not reflected in the three
recent reviews, with no explanation given as to why large segments
of the peer-reviewed literature were missing. For instance, in the
2008 review by Charles et al,6 several of the studies that were
overlooked actually met the inclusion criteria.10–19 Similarly,
studies examining substance misuse were not included in two of
the three reviews,6,7 with no rationale for excluding them.
Numerous studies have demonstrated statistically significant
associations between abortion and subsequent substance misuse,
a widely recognised and prevalent mental health problem.2,10,20–24
Third, in all three literature reviews the choice of studies
lacked sufficient methodologically based selection criteria.5–7 As
a result the sample of studies included was either too broad,
resulting in incorporation of results from numerous weaker
studies, or too narrow, resulting in unjustified elimination of
sound studies. Ironically, the largest review, by the American
Psychological Association Task Force, exemplifies both problems
as the selection criteria for one type of study (those with a
comparison group) were simply publication of empirical data
on induced abortion with at least one mental health measure in
peer-reviewed journals in English on US and non-US samples;5
however, non-US samples were avoided entirely for a second type
of study (no comparison group) examined in this review without
an appropriate rationale, resulting in elimination of dozens of
methodologically sophisticated international studies. In the review
conducted by Robinson et al the authors mention having
identified 216 peer-reviewed papers on the topic of abortion
and mental health and then note selection of a sample of studies
that ‘exemplify common errors in research methodology’ as well
as ‘major articles that attempt to correct the flaws’
.7 No details
were offered regarding how studies were chosen to fit into these
two categories.

Abortion and mental health: quantitative synthesis
and analysis of research published 1995–2009
Priscilla K. Coleman
Background
Given the methodological limitations of recently published
qualitative reviews of abortion and mental health, a
quantitative synthesis was deemed necessary to represent
more accurately the published literature and to provide
clarity to clinicians.
Aims
To measure the association between abortion and indicators
of adverse mental health, with subgroup effects calculated
based on comparison groups (no abortion, unintended
pregnancy delivered, pregnancy delivered) and particular
outcomes. A secondary objective was to calculate
population-attributable risk (PAR) statistics for each outcome.
Method
After the application of methodologically based selection
criteria and extraction rules to minimise bias, the sample
comprised 22 studies, 36 measures of effect and 877 181
participants (163 831 experienced an abortion). Random
effects pooled odds ratios were computed using adjusted
odds ratios from the original studies and PAR statistics were
derived from the pooled odds ratios.
Results
Women who had undergone an abortion experienced an
81% increased risk of mental health problems, and nearly
10% of the incidence of mental health problems was shown
to be attributable to abortion. The strongest subgroup
estimates of increased risk occurred when abortion was
compared with term pregnancy and when the outcomes
pertained to substance use and suicidal behaviour.
Conclusions
This review offers the largest quantitative estimate of
mental health risks associated with abortion available
in the world literature. Calling into question the conclusions
from traditional reviews, the results revealed a moderate to
highly increased risk of mental health problems after
abortion. Consistent with the tenets of evidence-based
medicine, this information should inform the delivery of
abortion services.

Review article
 The fourth troubling issue is the fact that quantification of
effects was not attempted by any of the three research teams.
Given the expansive literature on abortion and mental health,
there is no reasonable justification for not quantifying effects. In
the only truly systematic review available, published in 2003 by
Thorp et al, stringent selection criteria were employed and their
analysis of the largest and strongest studies available resulted in
the conclusion that abortion is associated with an increased risk
of depression that may lead to self-harm.4 Owing to the broad
objective of this review, which addressed physical complications
as well, a wide range of mental health effects were not examined.
In this highly politicised area of research it is imperative for
researchers to apply scientifically based evaluation standards in a
systematic, unbiased manner when synthesising and critiquing
research findings. If not, authors open themselves up to
accusations of shifting standards based on conclusions aligned
with a particular political viewpoint. Moreover, the results may
be dangerously misleading and result in misinformation guiding
the practice of abortion. Through a process of systematically
combining the
quantitative results
from
numerous
studies
addressing the same basic question (e.g. ‘is there an association
between abortion and mental health?’) far more reliable results
are produced than from particular studies that are limited in size
and scope. Moreover, as a methodology wherein studies are
weighted based on objective scientific criteria, meta-analysis offers
a logical, more objective alternative to qualitative reviews when
the area of study is embedded in political controversy. Therefore,
in an effort to provide a long overdue, dispassionate analysis of the
literature on abortion and mental health, the primary objective of
this review was to conduct meta-analyses of associations between
induced
abortion
and
adverse
mental
health
outcomes
(depression, anxiety, substance use and suicidal behaviour) with
sensitivity to the use of distinct control groups employed in the
various studies (no abortion, unintended pregnancy delivered,
pregnancy delivered). The focus was on studies published between
1995 and 2009 because of the considerable improvement in
research designs on the topic of post-abortion mental health in
recent years. Contemporary research on abortion and mental
health has addressed a number of shortcomings of the earlier work
by employing comparison groups with controls for third variables.
However, there has also been increased emphasis on incorporating
nationally representative samples, prospective designs, controls for
prior psychiatric history and comprehensive assessments of
mental health outcome measures which in some cases included
actual medical records. A secondary objective of this review was
to calculate population-attributable risk (PAR) percentages using
pooled odds ratios derived from the meta-analysis subdivided
by outcome measures. These statistics reflect the incidence of a
disorder in the exposed sample (e.g. women who have undergone
abortion) that is directly due to the exposure (the abortion
procedure). Both the pooled odds ratios and the PAR percentages
yielded herein provide readily interpretable indices of the mental
health consequences of abortion and should offer new clarity to
the academic debate and to clinicians seeking information to
guide effective practice.
Method
Inclusion criteria
Studies identified using the Medline and PsycINFO databases were
included in this review if they met the following criteria: a sample
size of 100 or more participants; use of a comparison group (no
abortion,
pregnancy
delivered
or
unintended
pregnancy
delivered);
one
or
more mental
health
outcome
variables
(depression, anxiety, alcohol use, marijuana use or suicidal
behaviour); controls for third variables; use of odds ratios to
express effects observed to facilitate calculation of readily
interpretable pooled odds ratios and PAR statistics; publication
in English in peer-reviewed journals between 1995 and 2009.
Rules for extraction and synthesis of effects
In addition to the above criteria, rules for extracting and
synthesising data derived from the studies selected were developed
based on the recommendations outlined by Lipsey,25 to avoid
overrepresentation
of
particular
samples
and
statistical
dependences among effects, and generally to ensure the most
conservative and unbiased assemblage of results from the
individual studies exhibiting considerable variability in reporting.
(a) Relevant studies contributed a maximum of one effect per
outcome. When authors reported more than one effect per
variable based on separate analyses conducted for distinct
demographic groups, or when different diagnoses were
reported on within a general class such as anxiety or
depression, a composite odds ratio was derived to avoid
overweighting in favour of particular studies.
(b) When studies had more than one comparison group, selection
rules were employed to provide more weight to comparisons
wherein the control group was most closely matched to the
abortion
group.
Specifically,
if
‘unintended
pregnancy
delivered’ was used the results relative to this group were
selected, and when only ‘pregnancy delivered’ and ‘no
abortion’ comparison groups were used, the effects pertaining
to the ‘pregnancy delivered’ group were selected.
(c) In situations wherein separate results were reported based on
one v. two or more abortions, the results specific to one
abortion were selected to enable sampling of a more
homogeneous
population.
There
are
studies
suggesting
differential effects based on the number of abortions.26,27
(d) When particular authors used the same sample and variables
in
more
than
one
publication,
only
the
most
recent
publication was selected. When the same data-set was used
by different groups, both sets of results were included when
distinct samples were defined.
Statistical analysis
Meta-analyses were conducted using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis
version 2.0 for Windows (Biostat, www.meta-analysis.com).
Random effects meta-analyses were computed based on the socio-
demographic heterogeneity of the study samples.43 The random
effects model takes into account two sources of variance
(within-study error and variation in the true effects across studies)
with the study weights designed to minimise both sources of
variance.43 A pooled odds ratio was computed using the full 36
effects extracted. In addition, two sets of subgroup pooled odds
ratios were calculated based on the type of comparison group used
and on specific forms of mental health problems. Adjusted odds
ratios with controls for third variables were used in all the random
effects meta-analyses. Finally, PAR percentages were computed
using the pooled odds ratios (OR) derived from the random
effects model subdivided by outcome measures. The PAR
percentages were calculated using the formula 1006(Px(OR71))/
(1 + Px(OR71)), where Px is the estimate of population exposure;
Px is calculated as c / (c + d), where c is the number of women in
the abortion group who did not experience the mental illness in
question and d is the number of women in the ‘no abortion’ group
who were identified as not having the mental illness examined.

Results
After applying the inclusion criteria and rules detailed above, the
sample consisted of 22 peer-reviewed studies (15 from the USA
and 7 from other countries);3,20–22,24,26–42 these comprised 36
measures of effect (9 alcohol use/misuse, 5 marijuana, 7 anxiety,
11 depression, 4 suicidal behaviour) and a total of 877 181
participants, of whom 163 831 had experienced an abortion (see
online Table DS1).
The first random effects meta-analysis, which included 36
adjusted odds ratios from the 22 studies identified, resulted in a
pooled odds ratio of 1.81 (95% CI 1.57–2.09, P50.0001). The
results of this analysis indicated that women who have had an
abortion experienced an 81% higher risk of mental health
problems of various forms when compared with women who
had not had an abortion (Fig. 1). Results of a second random
effects meta-analysis, wherein separate effects were produced
based on the type of outcome measure, are provided in Fig. 2.
All effects were statistically significant, with the largest pooled
odds ratio derived for marijuana use (OR = 3.30, 95% CI 1.64–
7.44, P= 0.001), followed by suicide behaviours (OR = 2.55, 95%
CI 1.31–4.96, P= 0.006), alcohol use/misuse (OR = 2.10, 95% CI
1.77–2.49, P50.0001), depression (OR = 1.37, 95% CI 1.22–
1.53, P50.0001) and anxiety (OR = 1.34, 95% CI 1.12–1.59,
P50.0001). These results indicate that the level of increased risk
associated with abortion varies from 34% to 230% depending
on the nature of the outcome.
In the third random effects meta-analysis (Fig. 3) three
separate pooled odds ratios were produced based on the type of
comparison group employed in the respective studies. When
women who had terminated a pregnancy were compared with
women who had not done so relative to all mental health
problems, the result was statistically significant (OR = 1.59, 95%
CI 1.36–1.85, P50.0001). When women who terminated a
pregnancy were compared with women who carried to term, using
the full set of mental health variables, the result was considerably
stronger (OR = 2.38, 95% CI 1.62–3.50, P50.0001). Finally, when
‘unintended
pregnancy
carried
to
term’
operated
as
the
comparison group, the result was likewise statistically significant
and closer to the result relative to the ‘no abortion’ comparison
group (OR = 1.55, 95% CI 1.30–1.83, P50.0001). These data
indicate that regardless of the type of comparison group used,
abortion is associated with an enhanced risk of experiencing
mental health problems, with the magnitude of this risk ranging
from 55% to 138%.
The
last
set
of
analyses
involved
calculation
of
PAR
percentages based on pooled odds ratio estimates. The overall
PAR percentage was nearly 10%, with the range for particular
mental health problems extending from 8.3% for anxiety to
26.5% for marijuana use (Table 1). In addition, a pooled odds
ratio for the two large-scale studies in which actual suicide was

 Abortion and mental health
measured yielded a significant result (OR = 4.11, 95% CI 1.82–
9.31) and a PAR percentage of 34.9% was derived using this
pooled odds ratio.
Discussion
Based on data extracted from 22 studies, the results of this
meta-analytic review of the abortion and mental health literature
indicate quite consistently that abortion is associated with
moderate to highly increased risks of psychological problems
subsequent to the procedure. The magnitude of effects derived
varied based on the comparison group (no abortion, pregnancy
delivered, unintended pregnancy delivered) and the type of
problem examined (alcohol use/misuse, marijuana use, anxiety,
depression, suicidal behaviours). Overall, the results revealed that
women who had undergone an abortion experienced an 81%
increased risk of mental health problems, and nearly 10% of the
incidence of mental health problems was shown to be directly
attributable to abortion. The strongest effects were observed when
women who had had an abortion were compared with women
who had carried to term and when the outcomes measured related
to substance use and suicidal behaviour. Great care was taken to
assess accurately the risks from the most methodologically
sophisticated studies, and the quantitatively based conclusions
reflect data gathered on over three-quarters of a million women.
Of particular significance is the fact that all effects entered into
the analyses were adjusted odds ratios with controls for numerous
third variables.

higher risks of mental health problems compared with carrying

a pregnancy to term is consistent with literature demonstrating
protective effects of pregnancy delivered relative to particular mental
health outcomes. For example, with regard to suicide, Gissler et al
reported the annual suicide rate for women of reproductive age to
be 11.3 per 100 000, whereas the rate was only 5.9 per 100 000
in association with birth.34 Several other studies conducted in
different countries have revealed even lower rates of suicide
following birth when compared with women in the general popu-
lation.44–47 More research is needed to examine systematically the
specific nature of this protective effect against suicide, to determine
the extent to which the protective effect holds for unintended
pregnancies delivered, and to examine possible protective effects
of childbirth relative to other mental health variables.
When the abortion group was compared with the no
pregnancy group and with the unintended pregnancy delivered
group, the magnitude of the effects was very close. This finding
challenges the generally accepted belief that unintended pregnancy
delivered represents the only or most appropriate control group
for studies designed to explore the impact of abortion on mental
health. Use of a no pregnancy delivered group may be a cleaner
control
group,
since
many
women
experience
postpartum
depression and/or anxiety following childbirth. From a practical
standpoint,
a
no
pregnancy comparison
group
should
be
considerably easier to secure than a group of women who deliver
an unintended pregnancy.
Future research
Future studies should explore possible process mechanisms
linking abortion to substance misuse and suicidal behaviour, since
the strongest effects were detected for these variables. For example,
substance misuse and suicidal behaviour may result from efforts
to block or avoid any psychological pain associated with the
procedure and may be construed as faster, easier remedies for
personal suffering than seeking professional help. Women could
find it particularly difficult to reach out to others if they
experience shame or guilt associated with the abortion. Consistent
with the contemporary ethos of evidence-based medicine wherein
effective use is made of the best available data from systematic
research, firm standards should be articulated for accessing and
synthesising information from the published literature for the
purpose of training healthcare personnel. The results of this
systematic,
quantitative
review
cast
serious
doubt
on
the
conclusions derived from the recently published traditional
reviews described earlier,5–7 and suggest that there are in fact some
real risks associated with abortion that should be shared with
women as they are counselled prior to an abortion decision.

 Abortion and mental health
Healthcare professionals are responsible for educating patients
in
a
manner
that
reflects
the
current
scientific
literature;
however, the average practitioner does not generally have the
time and expertise to study and attempt to resolve conflicting
interpretations of the published research in order to extract the most
reliable information. The responsibility therefore rests initially
within the research community to set aside personal ideological
commitments, objectively examine all high-quality published data,
and conduct analyses of the literature that are based on state-of-
the-art data analysis procedures, yielding readily interpretable
synopses as has been attempted here. Once this goal is satisfactorily
realised, professional organisations will face the challenge of
developing efficient protocols for informing practitioners and
for streamlining the dissemination of information to the public.
The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) within the
Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, which is a division
of the US Department of Health and Human Services (www.
ahrq.gov/clinic/3rduspstf/ratings.htm),
has
identified
basic
guidelines for how scientific evidence should be used to inform
practice. These are summarised below and are based on an analysis
of risks and benefits as established in the scientific literature.
.
Level A: Good scientific evidence indicates the benefits of the
service substantially outweigh the risks with clinicians advised
to discuss the service with eligible patients.
.
Level B: Fair scientific evidence indicates the benefits of the
service outweigh the risks with clinicians encouraged to
discuss the service with eligible patients.
.
Level C: At least fair scientific evidence indicating benefits are
provided by the service, but the balance between benefits and
risks precludes general recommendations. Clinicians are advised
to only offer the service if there are special considerations.
.
Level D: At least fair scientific evidence indicates the risks of
the service outweigh benefits with clinicians advised not to
routinely offer the service.
.
Level I: Scientific evidence is deficient, poorly done, or
conflicting precluding assessment of the risk benefit ratio.
Clinicians are advised to convey the uncertainty of evidence
surrounding the service to patients.
Putative benefits of abortion
Procedure benefits
of
abortion have not
been empirically
established and the results of the substantial review by Thorp et
al described earlier in conjunction with the results of the present
quantitative synthesis indicate considerable evidence documenting
mental health risks.4 Without more research pertaining to possible
benefits, the above guidelines are difficult to apply. In one study
by Major et al,14 the average response of the study respondents
reflecting
their
positive
post-abortion
emotional
reactions
(defined as ‘happy’, ‘pleased’ or ‘satisfied’) was 2.24 on a scale of
1 to 5, with 1 corresponding to ‘not at all’ and a 5 representing
‘a great deal’. The passage of time apparently did not result in
more positive emotions, because 2 years after abortion the average
rating dropped by a statistically significantly amount to 2.06. A
few additional studies have addressed associations between
abortion and educational attainment, income and other outcomes
of this nature, which may be construed as indirect indicators of
mental health;48,49 however, mental health benefits have received
scant direct attention in the literature.
Concerns regarding the deficient positive effects literature
were echoed in an editorial published in the Psychiatric Bulletin,50
in which Fergusson questioned the legitimacy of justifying over
90% of UK abortions based on the presumption that abortion
offers the benefit of reducing mental health risks associated with
continuing the pregnancy. Fergusson specifically stated:
Although decisions on whether to proceed with induced abortion are made on the
basis of clinical assessments of the extent to which abortion poses a risk to maternal
mental health, these clinical assessments are not currently supported by population-
level evidence showing the provision of abortion reduces mental health risks for
women having unwanted pregnancy.50
Until sound evidence documenting mental health benefits of abortion
is available, clinicians should convey the current state of uncertainty
related to benefits of abortion in addition to sharing the most
accurate information pertaining to statistically validated risks.
Strengths and limitations of this review
Motivated by the shortcomings of previous non-quantitative
efforts to synthesise and analyse a complex literature prone to
biased interpretations, I have attempted in this study to evaluate
systematically a wealth of data on the topic of abortion and mental
health. The use of inclusion criteria that resulted in incorporation
of the largest and strongest studies published in recent years is an
obvious strength. However, the review is clearly not exhaustive as
only a 15-year publication window was examined and studies that
did not incorporate a comparison group were not analysed. There
is a strong need for a quantitative review of literature examining
the hundreds of studies that have been conducted on samples
of women who obtained abortions without inclusion of a
comparison group. As noted previously, the review of literature
conducted by the American Psychological Association Task Force
confined their examination of this study form to US samples.5
Another limitation of my study relates to the lack of uniformity
in control variables, demographic characteristics of the samples,
length of time between the procedure and the follow-up assessments,
and considerable variation in how the outcomes were measured.
It is encouraging to note that methodologically sophisticated
studies on the topic of abortion and mental health are being
published at a significantly higher rate than ever before.
Researchers throughout the world are seeking to understand the
experience of induced abortion more fully and are increasingly
willing to take on a subject that has been shrouded in political
controversy and has not received the scholarly attention it
deserves. The latest example is a study based on National
Comorbidity Survey – Replication data by Canadian researchers
Mota et al.51 This 2010 study was published after the analyses
reported herein were conducted; however, its results are startlingly
similar. Statistically significant associations were observed between
abortion history and a wide range of mental health problems after
controlling for the experience of interpersonal violence and
demographic variables. When compared with women without
an abortion history, women with a prior abortion experienced a
61% increased risk of mood disorders. Abortion was further
linked with a 61% increased risk of social phobia, and increased
the risk of suicide ideation by 59%. In the realm of substance
misuse, the abortion-related increased risks for alcohol misuse,
alcohol dependence, drug misuse, drug dependence and any
substance use disorder were 261%, 142%, 313%, 287% and
280% respectively. Population-attributable risk percentages were
likewise similar, ranging from 5.8% to 24.7%.51
Concluding remarks
This review was undertaken in an effort to produce an unbiased,
quantitative analysis of the best available evidence addressing
abortion as one risk factor among many others that may increase
the likelihood of mental health problems. The composite results
reported herein indicate that abortion is a statistically validated
risk factor for the development of various psychological disorders.
However, when the independent variable cannot be ethically
manipulated, as is the case with abortion history, definitive causal
185
 Coleman
conclusions are precluded from both individual studies and from
a quantitative synthesis such as this one. Although an answer to
the causal question is not readily discerned based on the data
available, as more prospective studies with numerous controls
are being published, indirect evidence for a causal connection is
beginning to emerge.
