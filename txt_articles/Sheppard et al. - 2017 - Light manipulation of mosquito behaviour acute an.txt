Abstract
Background: Host-seeking behaviours in anopheline mosquitoes are time-of-day specific, with a greater propensity
for nocturnal biting. We investigated how a short exposure to light presented during the night or late day can
inhibit biting activity and modulate flight activity behaviour.
Results: Anopheles gambiae (s.s.), maintained on a 12:12 LD cycle, were exposed transiently to white light for 10-
min at the onset of night and the proportion taking a blood meal in a human biting assay was recorded every 2 h
over an 8-h duration. The pulse significantly reduced biting propensity in mosquitoes 2 h following administration,
in some trials for 4 h, and with no differences detected after 6 h. Conversely, biting levels were significantly
elevated when mosquitoes were exposed to a dark treatment during the late day, suggesting that light suppresses
biting behaviour even during the late daytime. These data reveal a potent effect of a discrete light pulse on biting
behaviour that is both immediate and sustained. We expanded this approach to develop a method to reduce
biting propensity throughout the night by exposing mosquitoes to a series of 6- or 10-min pulses presented every
2 h. We reveal both an immediate suppressive effect of light during the exposure period and 2 h after the pulse.
This response was found to be effective during most times of the night: however, differential responses that were
time-of-day specific suggest an underlying circadian property of the mosquito physiology that results in an altered
treatment efficacy. Finally, we examined the immediate and sustained effects of light on mosquito flight activity
behaviour following exposure to a 30-min pulse, and observed activity suppression during early night, and elevated
activity during the late night.
Conclusions: As mosquitoes and malaria parasites are becoming increasingly resistant to insecticide and drug
treatment respectively, there is a necessity for the development of innovative control strategies beyond insecticide-
treated nets (ITNs) and residual spraying. These data reveal the potent inhibitory effects of light exposure and the
utility of multiple photic pulses presented at intervals during the night/late daytime, may prove to be an effective
tool that complements established control methods.

 Background
Malaria infects over 250 million people and claims the
lives of approximately 438,000 individuals annually. Ap-
proximately 90% of these deaths occur in Africa, pre-
dominantly in children aged 5 years and under [1].
Anopheles gambiae is the major vector of malaria in
sub-Saharan Africa. Current control of malaria transmis-
sion is through control of the insect vector and efforts
to reduce biting events that can result in disease trans-
mission. As the female anopheline mosquito focuses its
behavioural activity including blood-feeding to the night
phase of the light:dark (LD) cycle, the mosquito bed net
has become a key barrier method in malaria transmis-
sion control. However, it is fast becoming apparent that
the efficacy of established methods of control, namely
insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs) and indoor residual
spraying (IRS) are compromised by both resistance to
insecticides [2, 3] and by behavioural adjustments made
presumably via changes in the genetic composition of
the Anopheles vector mosquito populations [4–11]. It
has been observed in various anophelines that the spe-
cific timing of biting activity can change under selective
pressure, thereby resulting in a temporal shift. This can
result in more biting events occurring either earlier in
the night, dawn or during the early daytime (i.e. becom-
ing daytime biters), and thereby make the efficacy of the
bed net significantly reduced. It is for this reason that ef-
forts are being made by the vector research community
to develop new strategies to complement existing con-
trol methods, including control of outdoor residual mos-
quito
populations.
In
line
with
this
approach,
we
explored the efficacy of timed exposure to light as a po-
tential method to reduce biting behaviour in An. gam-
biae mosquitoes.
There is a limited but established body of work explor-
ing how light impacts aspects of mosquito behaviour,
and in particular that of the An. gambiae circadian tim-
ing system (reviewed in [12, 13]). Photic cues can shape
the 24-h profiles of gene expression [14, 15] and flight
activity of An. gambiae mosquitoes [16–18]. However,
there is little work to date that has explored how light
can
modulate
mosquito
biting
behaviour.
Das
&
Dimopoulos [19] examined the effect of discrete treat-
ments of white light presented during the late night
phase of the diel cycle on biting activity using a mem-
brane feeding system and testing an outbred strain of
An. gambiae [19]. Under these specific experimental
conditions, it was revealed that as little as 2 min of 800–
1000 lux light has a potent inhibitory effect on blood-
feeding activity when presented at this specific time of
the night and that inhibition can be measured for up to
2 h after the pulse. In the current investigation, we ex-
plored the efficacy of timed exposure to white light to
modulate biting activity using a human-subject biting
assay. The study focused on examining a broad range of
times across the diel cycle, including the early night and
during the late day-time, times of the LD cycle when
humans may be unprotected by bed nets. To comple-
ment the biting behaviour assays, we also explored how
light might alter flight activity, as it is a component of
host-seeking behaviour. Previous work in our laboratory
and by Das & Dimopoulos [19] revealed a 24-h diel
rhythm in biting activity that also persists under con-
stant conditions of darkness, thereby demonstrating that
the rhythm is in part shaped by the mosquito endogen-
ous circadian clock [19, 20]. Differences between the bit-
ing profiles examined under LD cycle and constant dark
conditions also provided evidence for light exposure
during the light phase of the natural diel cycle to affect
blood-feeding propensity [20]. It was these data on diel
and circadian biting rhythms that provided the impetus
for the current investigation, and we hypothesised that a
discrete treatment of light would reproducibly suppress
An. gambiae blood-feeding behaviour and modulate
flight activity.
In this study, we have developed a technique to reduce
the incidence of biting and to disrupt the normal profile
of nocturnal flight activity of the anopheline mosquito.
Using exposure to white light presented at timed inter-
vals during the late daytime, dusk, dawn, and during the
night, we have demonstrated dramatic reductions in
mosquito biting of humans as well as increased or de-
creased levels of mosquito flight activity, dependent
upon the specific timing of light delivery. To reduce
mosquito host-seeking and biting events, and thereby re-
duce malaria transmission, we propose that the photic
exposure method could be used to augment current in-
sect control techniques or be implemented as a stand-
alone approach.
Methods
Mosquito rearing
Female An. gambiae (s.s.) (S form) Pimperena strain
mosquitoes (MRA-861, BEI Resources, Manassas, VA,
USA) were used for the biting light-inhibition and loco-
motion/flight activity assays. Note that this strain has
been utilized by us [14, 16, 20, 21] and others [22–24] in
the laboratory for several years; this was one of the col-
onies used for the S- versus M- molecular form sequen-
cing project [25] (now reclassified as An. gambiae (s.s.)
and An. coluzzii, respectively), and is available through
the MR4 NIAID/NIH BEI Resource Repository. Mosqui-
toes were maintained at 27 ± 1 °C and 85 ± 1% humidity
on a 12:12 LD cycle (11 h ~ 250 lux full light, 11 h dark-
ness, and 1 h dawn and dusk transitions) (Fig. 1a). Re-
ported times when mosquitoes are examined under LD
cycle conditions are recorded as Zeitgeber time (ZT)
with ZT0 being defined as the end of the 1 h dawn

 transition and the beginning of the full light cycle, and
ZT12 as the onset of the dark phase. In experiments in
which mosquitoes are transitioned from a LD cycle
into constant darkness at the end of the normal
night/dark phase, time is reported thereafter in Circa-
dian Time (CT), with CT0 being the start of the sub-
jective day and CT10 being the late subjective day. A
20% high fructose corn syrup solution was available
ab libitum throughout all experiments; the taking of
blood-meals occurred only in a light, temperature and
humidity controlled bay (a walk-in incubator con-
nected to an anteroom) and in the dark phase of the
LD cycle unless otherwise stated. The assessment of
blood meals occurred in the anteroom. Experiments
were conducted on 4–10 day old presumed mated fe-
male mosquitoes (i.e. host-seeking). Additionally, un-
less otherwise stated, all mosquitoes used for biting
assays, once transferred into experimental containers,
were placed in plastic light tight boxes (1 m [L] ×
0.6 m [W] × 0.5 m [H]) with their individual lighting
systems. These boxes were used to mimic the LD
cycle of the rearing bay as well as deliver the light
pulse protocols as described below.
Light-inhibition biting assays
Experiment 1: Single light pulse biting inhibition assay
during early night
To test for light-induced acute (immediate) and chronic
(sustained) biting inhibition, ≥ 25 mosquitoes were
placed into each of 10 small white translucent plastic
housing containers (8–10 cm diameter × 10 cm tall with
a 64 cm2 gauze mesh screen covering the top of the con-
tainer) ≥ 24 h before experimentation. Five containers re-
ceived a 10 min light pulse (300 lux [intensity equivalent
to comfortable human reading conditions] at ZT12) pro-
vided by a LED light bar (Utilitech GU0018P-LED-1,
Good Earth Lighting, Inc., Wheeling, IL, USA); the other
5 containers entered the dark phase of the LD cycle and
received no light exposure (controls). Immediately fol-
lowing the light pulse treatment (i.e. ZT12:10), one

 light-pulsed and one control container were simultan-
eously offered a blood meal for 6 min in the dark (an In-
vestigator’s arm was placed across the mesh at the top of
the container) [20]. Blood meals were offered to subse-
quent containers at ZT14, 16, 18, and 20 (Fig. 1b). It is
important to note that for this approach each experi-
mental container of mosquitoes only received a single
light treatment. At the end of the blood-feeding period,
the mosquitoes were then anaesthetized with CO2 and
visually assayed for the presence of blood in the abdo-
men (i.e. the abdomen visually appeared to be coloured
red when viewed by eye, with backlight illumination, in-
dicating a partially or fully fed mosquito). Four replicate
experiments were conducted.
Experiment 2: Late diel day, dark-acclimated biting assay
To investigate endogenous biting behaviour during the
late daytime and the effect of light during the natural
LD cycle, a pair of small housing containers each con-
taining ≥ 25 mosquitoes were exposed to either a single
15 min dark pre-treatment (experimental mosquitoes),
or remained on the normal LD cycle (control mosqui-
toes) prior to the pair simultaneously being offered a
blood meal for 6 min in the dark (Investigator’s arm).
This assay was performed with one pair of containers of
mosquitoes blood-feeding at 1.5 h prior to dusk/2.5 h
prior to lights off (ZT9.5), and another pair of containers
during the dusk transition/30 min before lights off
(ZT11.5). Following exposure, the mosquitoes were visu-
ally assayed for the presence of blood in the abdomen
(Fig. 1c). Five replicate experiments were conducted.
Experiment 3: Single-pulse acute biting inhibition assay
To examine the acute (immediate) inhibition effect of
light on biting behaviour at different times during the
night, and to determine whether this may change as a
function of diel/circadian time, 12 large white translu-
cent containers (17–19 cm diameter × 17 cm tall with a
100 cm2 mesh screen), containing ≥ 30 mosquitoes were
prepared prior to experimentation. At each time point
(ZT12, 14, 16, 18, 20 and 22) one experimental con-
tainer received a 6 min white light pulse (150 lux; illumi-
nated
from
the
base
of
the
container)
while
simultaneously being offered a blood meal from the top
of the container. The control container of mosquitoes
was not exposed to light and was offered a blood meal
for 6 min while in the dark. As experimental (exposed to
light) and control (in the dark) containers of mosquitoes
could not be fed simultaneously, experimental and con-
trol containers were fed in series one immediately after
the other, and alternating the order of feeding at each
time point. It is important to note that each experimen-
tal container of mosquitoes only received a single light
treatment. At the end of the 6 min exposure to the
Investigator’s arm the number of mosquitoes having
taken a blood meal was recorded as described above
(Fig. 1d). Three replicate experiments were conducted.
Experiment 4: Multi-pulse chronic biting inhibition assay
To examine the chronic (sustained) light suppression of
biting via the administration of multiple light pulses, 12
small containers of ≥ 25 mosquitoes were prepared. Six
containers (experimental groups) received a white light
pulse (300 lux) for 10 min at ZT12, while the remaining
six housing containers began the dark cycle and received
no light exposure (control). At ZT14, one experimental
and one control container were removed and simultan-
eously offered a 6 min blood meal in the dark, and the
number of mosquitoes that took a blood meal was re-
corded
as
previously
described.
At
ZT14,
the
5
remaining
experimental
containers
received
another
10 min light pulse. This procedure of pulsing and blood-
feeding was repeated at ZT16, 18, 20, and 22 (with the
last blood meal being offered at CT24/CT0 and where
the dawn transition and lights on did not take place for
either experimental or control mosquitoes) (Fig. 1e). It is
important to note that in this approach each experimen-
tal container of mosquitoes, except for the ZT14 group,
received multiple light pulses during the night, and for
each set of mosquitoes, a single opportunity to blood
feed, i.e. the ZT16 group received 2 pulses; ZT18, 3
pulses; ZT20, 4 pulses; and the ZT22 group received a
total of 5 pulses. Four replicate experiments were
conducted.
Experiment 5: Light manipulation of locomotion assay
Mosquitoes were individually loaded into 32, 15 cm
long × 2.5 cm diameter glass test tubes. The end of each
test tube was plugged using cotton wool wrapped
around a 2 ml microcentrifuge tube containing 20% high
fructose corn syrup, providing ad libitum access to sugar
water for the duration of the experiment. Test tubes
were then placed in Locomotion Activity Monitors 25
(LAMs; TriKinetics, Waltham, MA, USA) and loco-
motor/flight activity recorded. A photon-detector at the
centre of the tube was activated any time the mosquito
moved across an infrared beam of light, and the number
of crossings in a 1 min period was recorded. LAMs were
transferred to plastic light tight boxes as described above
(see [16] for additional experimental setup information).
An identical 12:12 LD cycle with 1 h dawn and dusk
transitions within the box was matched to the rearing
bay of the insectary for 4 days before transitioning to
constant dark (DD) conditions (Fig. 1a). At the end of
the forth full 24 h day and during the first 12 h in DD
(i.e the transition to the first circadian cycle), mosquitoes
were exposed to a 30 min white light pulse (300–870
lux, measured at the bottom to top of LAM unit)

 delivered automatically from within the box at either ZT
12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20, or 22, or CT 24/0, 2, 4, 6, or 8.
Note that the activity recorded during the day that the
mosquitoes were first introduced to the LAM unit (Day
1) was excluded from analysis to allow for stabilisation
of behaviour, and in instances, it contained an incom-
plete 24 h. Recording of activity under DD conditions
continued for 10 days after the light pulse was delivered.
The
locomotion
data
were
analysed
to
determine
whether light pulses perturbed flight behaviour in mos-
quitoes acutely and chronically. The average number of
beam crossings (counts) during the 30 min light pulse
on the pulse day was determined, and compared to the
counts during the matching Zeitgeber times of the prior
two control days. For a sustained/chronic effect of light
analysis, activity was also examined for the 3 days (pulse
day and prior 2 days) at different intervals over an 8 h
period that followed immediately after the light pulse
ended. Sixty minutes of activity was analysed specifically
during the first, second, third, fourth and eighth hour
following cessation of the 30 min light pulse. The aver-
age number of beam breaks during the 1 h period at the
different intervals was determined and the equivalent
Zeitgeber times on the 3 days compared. The sustained/
chronic effect analysis was performed on data from
pulses delivered at ZT12, 16, 22 and CT24/0, times
where acute effects of the pulse were observed.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using Sigma-Plot 12
(Systat Software, Chicago, IL, USA) and/or Microsoft
Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA). Biting percent-
ages and locomotion/flight activity were compared for
statistical differences by one-way ANOVA, two-way
ANOVA, repeated-measures ANOVA, and followed by
Tukey post-hoc tests where appropriate. Statistical sig-
nificance was at the level of P < 0.05. In the time-specific
flight activity experiments, changes in activity were only
reported as significant if the treatment day was found
different in the post-hoc analysis to both of the preceding
control days.
Results
Experiment 1: Biting behaviour can be suppressed by a
pulse of light delivered during the early night
To determine whether light presented to mosquitoes
during the early night would suppress biting behaviour,
populations of female An. gambiae (s.s.) mosquitoes
were tested with a human biting assay in the dark. Mos-
quitoes were treated with a light pulse at the beginning
of the dark phase/end of the dusk transition (ZT12), and
biting propensity was recorded immediately after presen-
tation of the light and at 2-h intervals by examining
mosquitoes for the presence of blood (Fig. 2). Light-
treated An. gambiae exhibited a reduced biting propen-
sity compared to time-matched controls, specifically
showing reduced biting by 42% of control levels immedi-
ately following the light pulse (ZT12:10) and by 32% 2 h
post light pulse (ZT14). Of note, biting propensity 4 h
following treatment appeared to be reduced but did not
reach significance level (ZT16; P = 0.061); however, the
significance value is low enough to warrant mention.
Experiment 2: Increased biting propensity from exposure
to darkness (dark pre-treatment) during the late daytime
Our previous diel and circadian analysis of biting pro-
pensity using the same 6 min exposure to a human arm
blood-meal/biting assay, revealed not only a distinct
rhythm in biting behaviour, peaking during the dark
phase of the LD cycle or during subjective night, but
also alluded to the possibility that light itself presented
during the circadian day/light phase of the LD cycle
could suppress biting [20]. To further evaluate in a
quantifiable manner this light exposure property during
the late daytime, mosquitoes were dark adapted by a
15 min pretreatment of darkness starting at ZT9.25 or
ZT11.25 and assessed for biting propensities at ZT9.5
and ZT11.5, respectively. This treatment during the late
daytime or during dusk resulted in a 58% elevation in
biting propensity for dark-adapted mosquitoes compared
to those maintained on the regular LD cycle. This effect

after the blood meal was offered by observing blood in the abdomen.

 was observed regardless of the time of testing, and the
magnitude of increased biting at each time point was
similar (Fig. 3). These data, therefore, reveal that light
suppression of biting can occur not only during the
night phase but also during the day phase of the diel
cycle.
Experiment 3: Light can immediately suppress biting
activity when presented at almost all phases of the night
Due to the efficacy of the single light treatment in redu-
cing biting behaviour in an immediate manner (Fig. 2),
we evaluated whether such a discrete light treatment
would have similar efficacy when presented at different
times of the night. We, therefore, examined the acute
biting inhibition effect at 2-h intervals throughout the
night, and where mosquitoes were exposed to light at
the actual time of exposure to the human arm. Light-
treated An. gambiae mosquitoes showed a significant
and dramatic decrease in biting propensity (55–94%)
compared to controls, which was consistently observed
throughout the night (Fig. 4). Tukey post-hoc analysis re-
vealed differences at all times tested except ZT22. Inter-
estingly, while biting of control non-pulsed mosquitoes
showed high biting levels throughout the night, and with
the highest levels at ZT14, the degree of inhibition be-
came progressively less as the night progressed and in a
stepwise progression (Fig. 4). This reduction of biting
propensity is indeed reflected by the diminishing signifi-
cance levels in the time-specific post-hoc tests, i.e. at
ZT12 (P < 0.001), ZT14 (P < 0.001), ZT16 (P = 0.005)
ZT18 (P = 0.025) and ZT20 (P = 0.017), but not ZT22 (P
= 0.498). While no significant difference was observed
between treated and non-pulsed mosquitoes at ZT22
(1 h before the start of dusk), a 23% reduction was ob-
served. These data suggest a circadian regulation of im-
mediate light
suppression
of
biting behaviour that
achieves the greatest efficacy during the early night and
the least efficacy during late night. Furthermore, this im-
mediate suppression of biting during the exposure to
light appears to be a stronger suppressor than when
assessed immediately after the presentation of light
(Figs. 2 and 4): at ZT12, biting propensity is suppressed
dramatically by as much as 94% of the mosquito popula-
tion when assayed during the light treatment, whereas
42% of the population show biting suppression when
tested in the dark immediately after light treatment.
Nevertheless, the after-effect of photic stimulation mea-
sured at ZT12 is still a large change in behaviour.

in sustained biting inhibition during the night
To investigate the sustained biting inhibition effect ob-
served earlier (Fig. 2), and assess its effectiveness as a
method to inhibit biting throughout the night, we

This protocol meant that mosquitoes assessed progres-

ZT16 received two pulses, and mosquitoes assessed at

suppressive effect of light upon biting can be observed
at all phases of the night tested (i.e. the mean values for
biting propensity are consistently lower than non-pulsed
controls), clearly there is a distinct drop-off in efficacy of
this sustained effect for 2 h during the late night (ZT20
and ZT22), followed by a return to robust suppression
at the start of subjective dawn (CT24/0).
Experiment 5: Locomotion/flight activity is modified by
photic stimuli in an immediate and time-specific manner
Locomotion/flight activity of An. gambiae mosquitoes
were recorded from individual mosquitoes housed in
glass tubes. Data were analysed to determine whether a
30 min light pulse would perturb flight behaviour in
mosquitoes acutely (an immediate response) and/or
chronically (a sustained/prolonged response). A single
light pulse was automatically delivered to the mosqui-
toes at specific times over the course of the night/dark
phase of the LD cycle or during the subjective daytime.
In the latter case, at the end of the normal dark phase of
the LD cycle, mosquitoes were transitioned into constant
darkness, during which a pulse was delivered. At least
3 days of flight activity were recorded including the
pulse day and the 2 days prior, and paired comparisons
made between these days for individual mosquitoes.
Significant changes in flight activity behaviour were
observed at four times of the night, specifically at ZT12,
ZT16, ZT22 and ZT24/0 (Fig. 6). During the 30 min
light pulse administered at the onset of the night at
ZT12, mosquitoes displayed a significant decrease in ac-
tivity compared to both the previous day and the
nudiustertian day (i.e. 2 days before the day of treat-
ment). Conversely, when the light was presented later in
the night at ZT16, ZT22, or ZT24/0, locomotor activity
during the 30 min pulse was elevated compared to both
control days (Fig. 6). No significant differences in activ-
ity were observed during the 30 min pulse when admin-
istered during the phases that fell during the subjective
day of the circadian cycle.
We next explored whether the light treatment would
lead to any sustained effects on flight activity. We, there-
fore, measured activity over a 1 h duration starting at dif-
ferent time intervals following the end of the light pulse.
Despite the acute effect seen from light pulses adminis-
tered at ZT12, ZT16, and ZT24/0, there were no signifi-
cant sustained perturbations in locomotion/flight activity
observed at 1, 2, 3, 4, or 8 h post-pulse following these
acute effects (Table 1: Fig. 7a, b and d); however, statistical
analysis revealed a sustained decrease in activity for 1 h
post-pulse (i.e. ZT22.5-23.5) when the pulse was adminis-
tered during the late night at ZT22 (Table 1; Fig. 7c).
Discussion
In this study, we have explored how light can modify
An. gambiae blood-feeding behaviour. We used timed
white light treatments under controlled laboratory con-
ditions presented singularly or as multiple pulses at vari-
ous intervals throughout the night, to explore the
efficacy of light to reliably suppress adult female mos-
quito biting and modify flight activity. The current work
builds upon our earlier studies of time-of-day-specific
blood-feeding activity in An. gambiae mosquitoes, and
how temporal changes in behaviour correlate with
physiological and molecular changes in olfactory modal-
ities [20]. Using a human arm blood-feeding assay, the
Pimperana strain exhibits a 24 h rhythm in biting,

 peaking during the early night. This rhythm is preserved
under constant conditions of darkness, thereby revealing
that the rhythm is also driven, at least in part, by the en-
dogenous circadian clock of the mosquito [19, 20]. The
experiments in the current study also complement the
work of Das & Dimopoulos [19], that explored biting
suppression in an outbred strain during the late night
using short pulses of bright light (2 min, 800–1000 lux)
and with an artificial membrane feeder in the absence of
a human [19].
The current study was designed first to explore the
potential modulation of blood-feeding behaviour by light

 specifically during the early night and late daytime, times
of the 24 h day that are proving to be critical in residual
biting activity even when ITNs have been introduced to
a malaria endemic area. Secondly, on establishing an ef-
ficient and effective level of suppression during the early
night, we wished to determine if the immediate suppres-
sive effect could be reproduced at all times of the night.
Thirdly, on discovery of a long duration (2–4 h) chronic
suppression of biting following a single pulse of light,
and to develop an efficient method to suppress biting ac-
tivity throughout the night, mosquitoes were exposed to
multiple short, discrete pulses of light. To complement
the biting studies, and since flight activity is a compo-
nent of host-seeking behaviour [26], we tested for modu-
latory effects of a light pulse treatment presented at
different times of the 24 h day upon a quantitative meas-
ure of general mosquito flight activity.
Anopheline mosquitoes are predominately nocturnal,
concentrating their feeding and flight activity (swarming,
migration and host-seeking) to the night [12, 13, 16, 20, 27].
We, therefore, hypothesised that a light pulse would
inhibit or reduce the propensity to bite a human host
when administered during the dark phase of the LD
cycle. In Experiment 1 of our investigation, An. gam-
biae mosquitoes demonstrated an acute (tested at
ZT12:10) and sustained (tested at ZT14) inhibition of
biting activity after a receiving a single 10 min white
light pulse presented at ZT12. Remarkably, the level
of biting suppression assayed on the human arm im-
mediately after cessation of the light pulse was at an
average of 42% of biting control levels. This inhibition
remained high at 32% for 2 h after delivery of the
light pulse; and somewhat surprisingly, the photic ef-
fect upon biting behaviour in some trials was sus-
tained for up to 4 h after the pulse.
The results of our second experiment in which we ex-
amined the potential for light exposure during the late
daytime to suppress biting activity were as predicted
from our previous work. In Rund et al. [15] using the
same strain of mosquitoes, we had observed that the bit-
ing propensity of mosquitoes studied under diel condi-
tions to be close to 0% during the day phase of the LD
Fig. 7 Sustained effects of a 30 min light pulse on An. gambiae mosquito flight activity. Mean flight activity measured during a 60 min period at
various intervals over 8 h (1, 2, 3, 4 and 8 h), following exposure to a 30 min light pulse. Analysis was conducted at times of the circadian cycle
that correspond with changes in activity that were detected during the 30 min exposure to light, i.e. at ZT12 (a), ZT16 (b), ZT22 (c) and CT24/0 (d) (see
also Fig. 6 for mean flight activity measured during the light pulse administration). Mean flight activity is compared on the day of treatment (triangle
symbols) to activity during the same period on the two prior, non-pulsed days (circle and square symbols). A pulse administered at ZT22
significantly inhibited activity during 1 h following the pulse (i.e. at ZT22.5–23.5; Table 1). No other significant differences between treat-
ment and control days were observed during the 8 h following the time-specific light pulses Table 1). One-way RM-ANOVAs followed by post-hoc tests

 cycle [20]. However, under constant dark (circadian)
conditions, while a distinct 24-h rhythm persisted for
several days, the level of biting during the ‘subjective’
daytime was elevated up to 70% of maximal night-time
biting levels. We, therefore, hypothesised that the pres-
ence of light during the daytime has a direct suppressive
effect on the biting behaviour of the mosquito. Further-
more, in a limited experiment, the effect of a 15 min
pretreatment of darkness on biting activity was exam-
ined and revealed an elevation when tested at each of
three different daytime phases of the diel cycle (ZT0,
ZT4 and ZT8) [20]. To examine this phenomenon in a
more controlled and complete fashion, we tested the ef-
fect of a 15 min treatment of darkness presented during
the late daytime (ZT9.25) or during dusk (ZT11.25) be-
fore undertaking the standard blood-feeding assay. The
results of this procedure revealed a distinct elevation in
biting activity as compared to time-matched control
mosquitoes that had simply been exposed to light within
the normal LD cycle. The effect was potent, as the dark-
treatment during the late daytime (2 h prior to dusk or
during actual dusk) resulted in a 58% elevation in biting
propensity compared with control mosquitoes. More-
over, this effect was observed and equally effective at
both times of the late daytime that were tested. This is
an important finding since it suggests that while An.
gambiae mosquitoes concentrate their blood-feeding
during the night, and that this behaviour is driven by
their endogenous circadian clock [19, 20], there is a re-
sidual negative masking effect of light that occurs during
the daytime.
In the third experiment, we tested the immediate re-
sponse of the mosquitoes to light while simultaneously
offering a human blood meal. These tests were per-
formed at one of six different times of the night to
evaluate whether differential responses would occur that
were time-of-day dependent. By testing at 2 h intervals,
this immediate inhibition effect was found to occur dur-
ing the entire night, i.e. at times tested during the early
to late night (i.e. ZT12-ZT22), and resulting in a dra-
matic suppression of biting activity of 42–66% as com-
pared to the time-matched controls. Interestingly, a
clear incremental decline of suppression was observed as
the night progressed. The differential responses that
were time-of-day specific suggest an underlying circa-
dian property of the mosquito physiology that results in
the altered treatment efficacy.
Based on the observations of these experiments, we
expanded this approach to photic manipulation of the
mosquitoes to develop a method to reduce biting pro-
pensity throughout the night by exposing mosquitoes to
a series of light pulses presented every 2 h. We hypothe-
sised that this protocol would result in a sustained inhib-
ition
of
blood-feeding
behaviour
throughout
the
duration of the night. In this fourth experiment, the
protocol elicited a sustained suppression of biting activ-
ity that was observed during the early to middle of the
night, as well as at the very end of the night/dawn
(ZT14, 16, 18 and CT0/24). While statistically significant
differences were not observed for ZT20 and ZT22, the
means for the pulsed groups were lower than the time
matched control groups. This was somewhat surprising
as we had hypothesised that the sustained response
would be equal at all times of the night. However, these
data suggest in a manner similar to the immediate re-
sponses tested in experiment 3, that the sustained effects
of light are influenced by an underlying circadian prop-
erty of the system. Additionally, the change in biting
propensity may reflect an increased homeostatic drive to
blood feed as the night progresses that then competes
with the light-suppressive mechanism. However, despite
the reduced efficacy of light delivered during the middle
of the night, the sustained response using the multiple
pulse approach provided suppression of biting during
the early to middle night and late night/dawn phases of
the night. As these times of night are critical phases of
the diel cycle when humans are most susceptible to bit-
ing events as they are unprotected when not sleeping
under a bed net, the results of the experiment suggest
that indeed this multi-pulse method might be effective
in the control of mosquito biting events in the field.
These striking results on photic manipulation of An.
gambiae blood-feeding behaviour generates several ques-
tions regarding the mode of action by which photic cues
impact mosquito physiology and behaviour. It is likely
that the mechanism within the brain circuitry for the
acute behavioural response (suppression of biting) to
light is mediated by a neuronal response (potentiation
and integration) and/or phosphorylation of protein(s)
due to its rapid response; whereas the sustained effect of
photic stimulation is likely to result from the turnover of
protein and/or de novo change in gene expression and
subsequent change in protein synthesis [28, 29]. Such
changes in gene expression have been observed in Dros-
ophila head and An. gambiae head and whole body fol-
lowing photic stimulation [19, 30, 31]. However, it is
unlikely that the behavioural effects observed in the
current study are operated through changes in the circa-
dian clock [14, 32]; yet in theory, a phase shift of the
clock could change the temporal profile of the 24 h bit-
ing preference rhythm [20]. The clock in other organ-
isms has been shown to be reset by light by 2–3 h but
not at 1 h after the start of a precisely-timed photic
stimulus [33, 34]. Therefore, a shift of the circadian
clock would not explain the acute suppression of biting
that is observed immediately after the start of the light
pulse (i.e. within 15 mins at ZT12.25), or during the ac-
tual exposure to the light, as observed at various times
Sheppard et al. Parasites & Vectors  (2017) 10:255 
Page 10 of 14
 during the night. A shift of the clock might, however,
contribute to the changes observed after two or more
hours after photic treatment (e.g. at ZT14 when treated
with light for 10 min at ZT12). As light presented during
the early night (ZT12–14) would be predicted to pro-
duce a phase delay of the clock and light during the
middle to late night (ZT15–24/0) would result in a
phase advance [19, 35], these adjustments may well shift
the position of the biting rhythm [19, 20]. These shifts of
the clock, based on a circadian light phase response
curve (PRC) for An. gambiae [35], might explain some
but not all of the results of Experiment 4, where mosqui-
toes were exposed to multiple pulses of light at night.
We would predict to generate relatively small shifts of
the clock, and maximally a 2 h average shift when the
light is presented at ZT14 (delay) or ZT15 (advance).
However, since the average biting propensity of the con-
trol groups of mosquitoes in Experiment 4 was ≥ 80%
when examined at different times across the night, and
the biting activity of light-pulsed mosquitoes tested at
ZT16 and ZT18 was ≤ 50%, factors other than a shift of
the endogenous biting rhythm would have to account
for this suppression of biting. The exception would be a
discrete light pulse delivered at ZT22 and tested 2 h
later at CT24/0 since a phase advance might shift the
biting rhythm into the subjective day, and thus to a
phase of the circadian cycle where we would expect re-
duced biting activity [19, 20].
While not explicitly tested in the current investigation,
we hypothesise a dose dependency of photons per unit
time, such that a higher light intensity would require a
lower exposure duration to reach the desired level of
suppression of feeding [19]. For example, 1 min at 5000
lux may provide the equivalent inhibition of feeding as
10 min at 300 lux and 30 min at 30 lux. Therefore, it is
plausible that an increased dose of light could unmask
some of the subtle effects of light upon suppression,
such as at ZT20–22 in the multi-pulse experiment, as
well as simply increase the treatment efficacy at all
phases of the night and late daytime. A similar predic-
tion could be made for a dependency upon the specific
wavelength(s) of light upon the efficacy of the pulse
treatment [36, 37]. We predict that there will be a spe-
cific wavelength(s) of light that will have maximal effi-
cacy in the immediate and sustained suppression of
biting behaviour and related effects of suppression or
elevation of flight activity. Selecting a monochromatic
light source in this maximal range would allow for
modulation of behaviour at lower intensities of light.
Additionally, selecting a monochromatic light source
that is outside of the blue colour of the spectrum, even
if sub-optimal, might allow for manipulation of mos-
quito behaviour without disruption of human behaviour/
physiology (e.g. human arousal, circadian phase shifting)
[38, 39]. In the current study we purposefully used
broad-spectrum white light, but having established a
baseline level of suppression, testing different colours of
light might allow for enhanced utility of light as a vector
control method. Ultimately, testing this variable as well
as different light intensities and durations of exposure is
beyond the scope of the current study.
In an effort to understand the broader impact of light
on An. gambiae behaviour, we examined mosquito flight
activity during and several hours following treatment
with white light at different phases of the circadian cycle
including both the night and subjective daytime (tested
while in constant darkness). Adult female mosquitoes
exposed to the photic treatment demonstrated an acute
flight inhibition during a 30-min light pulse when pre-
sented at the start of night at ZT12 (a 79% suppression
of activity compared to the same Zeitgeber time of con-
trol days), and conversely an acute elevation of flight ac-
tivity during an equivalent light pulse presented at
ZT16, ZT22 or CT24/0 (with a dramatic ≥ 1000% in-
crease of activity when the mosquito was treated at the
end of night or dawn). There was also a sustained effect
on flight activity during the 1 h immediately following
cessation of the light when the administration of the
light pulse was during the late night at ZT22; however,
the activity was reduced (by 80%), not increased as ob-
served during the time of pulse administration. In the
time-specific light pulse treatment groups examined
(namely ZT12, ZT16, ZT22 and CT24/0), this was the
only significant change in flight activity detected over
the course of the 10 h following the photic treatment.
We propose that the sudden inhibition of flight activ-
ity seen at ZT12, and elevation of activity at ZT22 and
ZT24, represent ‘masked’ responses [40] and comparable
to the immediate suppression of biting activity during
exposure to the light pulse, as briefly discussed above. In
this mechanism upon the area becoming illuminated the
mosquito behaviour is acutely altered in a negative or
positive manner, and that a shift in the circadian timing
system is not directly responsible for the immediate be-
havioural response. Negative, positive and paradoxical
masked responses to light have been documented in a
similar fashion in laboratory rodents and Drosophila
[40–42]. Furthermore, complementary to the data pre-
sented here, modifications to swarming behaviour of
anophelines in response to changes in light exposure
have been reported in the field and laboratory [36, 43].
For example, when located inside a dark outdoor barn,
male An. maculipennis atroparvus demonstrated typical
swarming behaviour; however, when the light intensity
of the area increased by ~1.0 log lux, swarming abruptly
stopped [43]. Interestingly, when the light was prevented
from entering the area swarming recommenced. This
suggests that the acute inhibition of activity by light was,
Sheppard et al. Parasites & Vectors  (2017) 10:255 
Page 11 of 14
 like the data we present here, a masked response to the
stimulus and not an endogenous response mediated by
the circadian clock. Masked responses may provide in-
creased fitness benefits to the organism by allowing a
rapid reaction to environmental change. For example,
upon the sudden illumination of an occupied area, sur-
vivorship is increased (e.g. by avoiding potential preda-
tion or desiccation) [44]. As clock-mediated adaptation
takes considerably longer to manifest (> 1 h), it would
be evolutionary detrimental for a clock mechanism to
orchestrate such responses.
The result at ZT12 of photic suppression of flight
activity is perhaps not surprising. The intense and short-
lived elevation in general activity that normally corre-
sponds with dusk/onset of night is likely related to
behaviours such as the movement from resting sites,
swarming, migration and sugar feeding [12, 16, 27]. An
interaction of environmental variables such as light and
endogenous rhythms can be seen in a modification to
the profile of flight activity at dusk. Also studied using
the LAM unit assay, both An. gambiae and An. coluzzii
exhibit a different minute-to-minute pattern of activity
depending on whether mosquitoes are exposed to a ‘nat-
ural’ dusk transition or maintained under conditions of
constant darkness [16]. As has been demonstrated in
various mosquito species including anophelines, the light
intensity is an important factor in the timing of swarm-
ing events [12, 36], such that intensities above certain
thresholds can result in cessation of swarming or inhib-
ition of its onset.
While we believe that the current study is the first to
quantify changes in flight activity of An. gambiae mos-
quitoes over the 24-h circadian cycle, Jones et al. [35]
qualitatively described a “lights on reaction” in An. gam-
biae flight activity when exposed to light under DD con-
ditions and using an acoustic assay [35]. Consistent with
the current investigation, a decrease in activity was ob-
served at ZT12, marked increases when the light was
presented later in the night, and no responses observed
during the subjective daytime. The consistency of obser-
vations between studies despite using different experi-
mental approaches suggests that the acute responses to
photic stimuli represent a highly reproducible behav-
ioural response that is conserved across An. gambiae
strains.
From the experimental design of the study used here,
it is unclear if the observed increases in flight activity
observed during the night and dawn were photophilic,
photophobic or reflect an escape response. The modula-
tion of locomotion/flight activity in our LAM assay
could represent positive or negative phototaxis, such as
an attraction to the exit of a shelter, or a shelter-seeking
‘escape’ response [45]. Alternatively, it could be a neutral
phototaxic response, i.e. no specific orientation, and
simply represents an increase or decrease in generalised
flight activity, e.g. the photic suppression of activity that
we observe with a treatment at ZT12 could represent a
suppression of swarming-related ‘excited’ activity. How-
ever, without further experimentation, using an arena
apparatus, for example, it is unclear what the suppressed
(at ZT12) or elevated flight activity (at ZT16, ZT22 and
ZT24/0) represents in the natural behavioural repertoire
of the mosquito.
The mechanism by which the photic cues are sensed
by the mosquito, that in turn influence brain-behaviour
pathways involved in the modulation of biting and flight
activity, is likely to include the photoreception cascade
of the compound eye [46, 47]. The use of broad
spectrum white light does not favour or preclude one
specific opsin photopigment or class of ommatidium in-
volved in detecting blue, green or red wavelengths of
light [14, 47, 48]. The immediate response to photic
stimuli are indeed likely to be conveyed by the com-
pound eyes and via their neuronal connections to the
brain, but it is plausible that the sustained effects of the
light treatment involve non-retinal photoreception. This
might include the flavoprotein cryptochrome photopig-
ment system (specifically CRY1 in An. gambiae), found
expressed throughout the insect body [14, 49], and that
is important in the photic-resetting mechanism of the
insect circadian clock [49–53]. Obviously identifying the
specific opsins, photoreceptors, and downstream neur-
onal and endocrine pathways associated with the behav-
ioural responses reported herein generates interesting
questions for future investigation.
We note this is a laboratory-based study, using one in-
bred mosquito line, with mosquitoes kept in small con-
tainers, and shielded from any low-level nocturnal light
and from continuous exposure to host odours. To com-
plement any field-trials, future laboratory work might in-
clude a determination of the optimal wavelength of light
to produce a given behavioural response, generate a
photic dose response curve, optimize the spacing and
timing of light pulses, and explore further the effect of
low-level nocturnal light, e.g. moonlight, on behaviour
[54–56]. The suppressive nature of light on mosquito
biting on successive and subsequent nights of treatment,
and in the constant presence of host cues might also be
aspects worthy of evaluation.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we find that light is a potent modulator
of mosquito biting behaviour and flight activity. These
data provide evidence for both immediate (acute) and
sustained (chronic) suppression of biting behaviour.
Photic suppression of biting shows greatest efficacy dur-
ing the early and mid-part of the night and the late day-
time.

 behaviour, is decreased by light at night onset and in-
creased during the middle of the night and at night off-
set: this could represent photophilic, photophobic or
photo-neutral behaviour. Furthermore, time-of-day spe-
cific differential responses in biting behaviour and flight
activity suggest an underlying circadian property of these
biological systems. Finally, multiple pulses of light with
long 2 h intervals could be an efficient method to sup-
press biting activity, especially indoors: This could aug-
ment current barrier and insecticidal strategies used to
control mosquito-human interaction.
At present, insecticide-treated bed nets and indoor re-
sidual spraying of insecticides are heavily relied upon to
prevent the transmission of malaria; however, as mosqui-
toes are becoming increasingly resistant to insecticidal
treatments, and Plasmodium spp. become resistant to
drug treatments [3, 57], there is a necessity for the on-
going development of novel and innovative control strat-
egies. The current data illustrates the development of a
method for the manipulation of mosquito biting and
flight/locomotor activity behaviours using exposure to
white light presented at timed intervals or during the late
daytime, dusk, dawn, and during the night. This treatment
may provide a useful method to augment current insect
control methods, as well as acting alone, to reduce host-
seeking (which involves flight) and biting events.
