Background: The increased incidence and geographic expansion of Lyme disease has 
made it the most common vector-borne infection in North America. Posttreatment Lyme 
disease syndrome (PTLDS) represents a subset of patients who remain ill following stan-
dard antibiotic therapy for Lyme disease. The spectrum of symptoms and their impact on 
quality of life remain largely unexplored among patients with well-documented PTLDS.
Objective: To characterize a case series of patients with well-documented PTLDS 
compared to a sample of healthy controls.
Methods: Sixty-one participants met the proposed case definition for PTLDS. Twenty-
six healthy controls had neither a clinical history of Lyme disease nor current antibodies 
to Borrelia burgdorferi. Participants with PTLDS and controls were evaluated by physical 
exam, clinical laboratory testing, standardized questionnaires, and a 36-item current 
symptom list.
results: Compared to controls, participants with PTLDS reported significantly greater 
fatigue, pain, sleep disturbance, and depression (Fatigue Severity Scale: 50.0 ± 10.6 vs. 
19.8 ± 8.6; Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire: 13.7 ± 8.3 vs. 0.8 ± 1.9; Pittsburgh 
Sleep Quality Index: 10.1 ± 4.7 vs. 4.1 ± 2.1; Beck Depression Inventory-II: 15.1 ± 7.7 
vs. 2.2 ± 3.2; p < 0.001 for each), and significantly lower quality of life (SF-36 Physical 
Component Score: 33.9 ± 9.7 vs. 55.1 ± 6.2; Mental Component Score: 42.9 ± 10.1 vs. 
54.2 ± 5.4; p < 0.001 for each). Nineteen non-PTLDS-defining symptoms were found 
to be significantly more severe among participants with PTLDS than controls, including 
sleep difficultly and visual complaints. Initial delayed or misdiagnosis was characterized 
in 59.0% of participants with PTLDS, and 32.2% had abnormal vibratory sense.
conclusion: Although physical exam and clinical laboratory tests showed few objective 
abnormalities, standardized symptom questionnaires revealed that patients with PTLDS 
are highly and clinically significantly symptomatic, with poor health-related quality of life. 
PTLDS patients exhibited levels of fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, sleep disturbance, and

depression which were both clinically relevant and statistically significantly higher than 
controls. Our study shows that PTLDS can be successfully identified using a systematic 
approach to diagnosis and symptom measurement. As the prevalence of PTLDS con-
tinues to rise, there will be an increased need for physician education to more effectively 
identify and manage PTLDS as part of integrated patient care.

Lyme disease was first recognized in the United States in the 
mid-1970s and the tick-borne bacterial pathogen, Borrelia burg-
dorferi, was first identified in 1982 (1). Since then, the infected 
tick vectors and the disease have spread geographically in North 
America (2, 3). Incidence rates have continued to rise in recent 
years, and the CDC currently estimates approximately 300,000 
new cases annually in the United States (4).
The distinctive feature of early Lyme disease is the erythema 
migrans rash, which is recognized in many, but not all patients 
an average 7–10 days after the bite of an infected tick (5, 6). The 
rash may be accompanied by viral-like symptoms such as fever, 
myalgia, arthralgia, or fatigue. Treatment of early Lyme disease 
is generally effective in resolving objective manifestations of the 
disease and preventing development of later manifestations of 
untreated infection (7). Since the rash is not always present or 
recognized in early Lyme disease and the viral-like symptoms can 
mimic other illnesses, delayed diagnosis and treatment remain a 
significant problem (8). In untreated Lyme disease, the bacteria 
may disseminate through the blood stream to other areas of the 
skin, nervous system, or heart (5). Late, untreated disease can 
present weeks to months after the initial infection, and primarily 
involves the joints and the nervous system (5, 9), and can be more 
difficult to treat.
In contrast to untreated stages of infection, it has been noted 
that approximately 10–20% of patients experience a constel-
lation of prolonged, primarily patient-reported symptoms 
following standard antibiotic treatment for early or late Lyme 
disease (10). This chronic illness, most recently called posttreat-
ment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS), is distinct from the 
slowly resolving, self-limited symptoms sometimes seen after 
completion of antibiotic therapy (11). It is also a defined subset 
of patients distinct from those with non-specific chronic Lyme 
disease, which has become a focal point of ongoing controversy 
and debate (11). The pathophysiology of PTLDS is currently 
unknown, with additional research needed to delineate potential 
roles of infection-induced immune dysfunction (12, 13), inflam-
mation due to persistent bacteria (14) or bacterial debris (15), or 
other mechanisms. Risk factors for PTLDS have been identified 
which include delay in diagnosis (16, 17) and increased severity 
of initial illness, including the presence of neurologic symptoms 
(7, 18). Moreover, initial exposure to non-recommended antibi-
otics (19) or steroids (20) has also been associated with worse 
clinical outcomes.
In 2006, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) 
published a proposed case definition for PTLDS (21). Briefly, this 
definition relies on prior physician-documented Lyme disease, 
treatment with standard of care antibiotics, and the development 
of significant fatigue, widespread musculoskeletal pain, and/or 
cognitive difficulties that last for a period of at least 6 months, 
and began within 6 months of a Lyme diagnosis and recom-
mended treatment (21). Patients can be excluded for a range of 
symptoms, conditions, or laboratory abnormalities that could be 
associated with or explain the symptomatology of PTLDS (21). 
As antibodies to B. burgdorferi are known to fall over time in 
treated patients regardless of clinical outcome (7, 22–24), and 
convalescent antibodies after treatment of early Lyme disease are 
positive in 65% of patients (25), presence of reactive antibodies 
is not part of this definition. In the clinical setting, PTLDS is 
largely an historical diagnosis that hinges on the ability to docu-
ment symptom onset after an episode of physician-documented 
Lyme disease that was adequately treated with standard of care 
antibiotics.
Patients with PTLDS represent a defined subset of a het-
erogeneous group of patients evaluated for unexplained fatigue, 
pain, and neurocognitive symptoms by primary care and 
sub-specialty physicians. However, the clinical, laboratory, and 
symptom characteristics of PTLDS remain largely unexamined 
and unreported in the literature, particularly among patients 
whose initial Lyme disease diagnosis and treatment reflects 
the community practice setting. To our knowledge, no studies 
have described patients with rigorously defined PTLDS drawn 
from a community pop 
u 
lation. The goal of the current study is 
to delineate PTLDS-specific patterns in physical exam findings, 
clinical laboratory results, symptom reporting, and quality of life 
by characterizing the first 61 participants enrolled in an ongo-
ing case series of well-documented PTLDS, and to compare this 
group to a sample of control participants screened for a history 
of prior Lyme disease.

study Participants
Participants with PTLDS were physician or self-referred to the 
Johns Hopkins Lyme Disease Research Center and were sub-
sequently invited to participate in this study, or self-referred to 
the Center specifically for research participation. The screening 
process and eligibility criteria are detailed in Table 1. We estimate 
that approximately 16% of patients referred to the center were 
eligible for and chose to enroll in this study.
Interested patients were provided study information and 
screened for self-reported exclusionary medical conditions diag-
nosed within the time frames indicated. If eligible, participants 
gave approval for medical record review of prior Lyme disease

diagnoses, signs, symptoms, two-tier serologic test results, and 
antibiotic treatment. Patients were considered eligible if the 
medical record documented prior “confirmed” (LD-confirmed) 
or “probable” (LD-probable) early or late disease, following 
the CDC’s 2011 case classification (26). All serologic tests for 
antibodies to B. burgdorferi were considered confirmatory in 
the context of illness duration, and if conducted at a laboratory 
following CDC recommendations for test interpretation (26, 27).
Healthy controls were originally recruited from an internal 
medicine practice in the same geographic location as part of a 
separate longitudinal cohort study. They did not have a clinical 
history suspicious for diagnosed or undiagnosed Lyme disease, 
and were CDC-negative on two-tier testing for antibodies to 
 
B. burgdorferi. Controls were screened for the same self-reported 
exclusionary medical conditions found in Table 1, with the 
exception of the illicit substance and prescription drug abuse 
questions.
All participants with PTLDS and controls were over the age 
of 18 at time of study enrollment, and both groups were enrolled 
throughout the calendar year. This study was approved by the 
Institutional Review Board of the Johns Hopkins University 
School of Medicine and written consent was obtained from 
all participants. All subjects gave written informed consent in 
accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The protocol was 
approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Johns Hopkins 
University School of Medicine.
clinical and laboratory evaluation
A trained interviewer administered a series of detailed question-
naires concerning general medical, Lyme disease-specific, medi-
cation, and symptom histories. A physical exam was performed 
that included measurement of respiratory rate, pulse, and blood 
pressure with the participant in the prone position and again after 
10 min of standing. The lymph nodes, thyroid, pharynx, lung, 
heart, liver span, and spleen were all examined. A complete joint 
exam was performed to assess for evidence of joint inflammation 
or synovitis. An extensive neurologic assessment was performed 
that included cranial nerve, motor, cerebellar, and sensory exams. 
Vibratory index was measured on the distal interphalangeal joint 
of the index finger and on the interphalangeal joint of the hallux 
using a Rydel-Seiffer 64 Hz tuning fork (29).
A complete blood count, complete metabolic count, C-reactive 
protein, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and immuno-
globulin M and immunoglobulin G Western Blot (IgM-WB/
IgG-WB) testing for antibodies to B. burgdorferi were obtained. 
All Lyme serologic tests were performed through a large com-
mercial laboratory following CDC recommendations for test 
interpretation (27).
symptoms and Quality-of-life evaluation
Symptoms were measured by standardized questionnaires includ-
ing the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), the Short-Form McGill Pain 
Questionnaire (SF-MPQ), the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index 
 4

(PSQI), and the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI). These stand-
ardized questionnaires are widely used to measure fatigue, pain, 
sleep quality, and depression in clinical and research settings. 
Specifically, the FSS 9-item fatigue metric has summary scores 
ranging from 9 to 63 with a higher score indicating worse fatigue, 
and with ≥36 indicating clinically relevant levels of fatigue (30). 
The SF-MPQ 15-item pain metric has summary scores ranging 
from 0 to 45 with a higher score indicating worse pain, and with 
≥4 indicating a clinically significant experience of pain (31, 32). 
The PSQI sleep metric has summary scores ranging from 0 to 21 
with a higher score indicating worse sleep quality, and with ≥6 
indicating clinically significant poor sleep quality (33). The BDI 
21-item depression metric has summary scores ranging from 0 to 
63 with a higher score indicating worse depression, and with ≥14 
indicating mild, moderate, or severe depression (34).
Additionally, participants were asked to self-administer a 
36-symptom list developed based on prior clinical and research 
experience among patients with PTLDS. For each of the 36 
symptoms, participants indicated presence and severity (“absent,” 
“mild,” “moderate,” or “severe”) over the past 2 weeks.
Quality of life was measured by the Short-Form Health 
Survey, Version 2 (SF-36). This 36-item quality-of-life metric 
can be summarized into Physical and Mental Component Scores 
(PCS and MCS, respectively), with higher score indicating higher 
quality of life (35). These scores can also be compared with the 
US population mean (50.0 ± 10.0) (35).
statistical analyses
First, we summarized all participants’ demographic characteris-
tics. For participants with PTLDS, we then summarized their Lyme 
disease history. We then compared participants with PTLDS and 
healthy controls on their laboratory results and physical exam 
findings. Summary scores from standardized questionnaires 
measuring symptoms and quality of life were plotted by group, 
compared with clinically relevant cutoffs and/or the population 
mean, and contrasted between participants with PTLDS and 
controls. For the 36-symptom list, we compared participants 
with PTLDS and controls, and extracted the symptoms that were 
statistically different between the two groups. We then plotted 
the proportion of participants reporting “mild,” “moderate,” or 
“severe” on these differentiating symptoms. For each symptom, 
we also calculated the difference in the proportion reporting a 
severity of “moderate” or above between participants with PTLDS 
and controls. All analyses were then repeated without controls to 
compare LD-confirmed with LD-probable cases.
Counts and percentages were used to summarize categorical 
data. Means and SDs or medians and interquartile ranges (IQR) 
were used to summarize continuous variables, as appropriate. All 
comparisons were performed using t-tests or non-parametric 
Wilcoxon rank sum tests for continuous variables, and chi-square 
or Fisher’s exact tests for categorical variables, as appropriate. 
Regression analyses were conducted where additional variables 
were introduced as potential confounders. Specifically, we used 
multiple linear regression models for the original continuous out-
come variables, as well as logistic regression models for outcome 
variables dichotomized based on normal cutoff values. The pre-
dictor of interest was group indicator (PTLDS vs. control group). 
Age, gender, and blood pressure medication use were adjusted 
for where appropriate. A P-value less than 0.05 was considered 
significant. All statistical analyses and graphs were performed 
using SAS (version 9.3, SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA), R (version 
3.3.1), and GraphPad Prism (version 6.05, La Jolla, CA, USA).
resUlTs
Participant characteristics
The PTLDS and control participant groups were similar by gen-
der (PTLDS: 52.5% female vs. controls: 53.9%, p = 0.906), and 
race (PTLDS: 93.4% white, non-Hispanic vs. controls: 88.5%, 
p = 0.422). Although not statistically significant, the PTLDS 
group was a mean of 5.4 years younger (PTLDS: 49.3 vs. controls: 
54.7, p = 0.157). A significantly higher proportion of controls 
reported graduate or professional training (PTLDS: 24.6% vs. 
controls: 61.5%, p = 0.001). Among participants with PTLDS, 3 
(4.9%) were currently receiving and 7 (11.5%) had ever received 
disability related to Lyme disease.
lyme Disease history
The Lyme disease history of the PTLDS group is described 
in Table 2. When the first signs or symptoms of Lyme disease 
appeared, the majority (95.1%) were residents of states which 
accounted for 96% of all confirmed case reports in 2014 (3). 
Based on medical record review, 68.9% met the CDC surveillance 
criteria for LD-confirmed at the time of their initial presentation 
prior to treatment (26). The remaining 31.1% met criteria for 
LD-probable. Our cohort was a median of 3.6 years from onset of 
PTLDS symptoms to study enrollment, with a range of 8.3 months 
to 27.7 years. Time from illness onset to first recommended 
course of antibiotic treatment was a median of 30 days. Based 
on self-report, the median total length of antibiotic exposure at 
time of enrollment was approximately 3 months. As defined in 
Table 2, delayed or initial misdiagnosis could be characterized in 
59% of the sample.
clinical and laboratory evaluation
Clinical laboratory and physical exam findings are shown in 
Table 3. At the time of the study visit, 43.3% of participants with 
PTLDS had a positive IgG-WB. We also examined participants’ 
lymphocyte count and liver function tests. Although the propor-
tion of participants with PTLDS with lymphocyte and liver func-
tion abnormalities was higher than controls for each (lymphocyte 
count: 3.4 [2/59] vs. 0.0%, AST: 8.3 [5/60] vs. 7.7%, ALT: 20.0 
[12/60] vs. 7.7%), no statistically significant differences were 
found, even after controlling for age.
None of the participants with PTLDS were found to have 
lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, or pharyngeal abnormalities 
on examination. Participants with PTLDS had a median respira-
tory rate three breaths per minute higher (p < 0.001), and their 
median diastolic blood pressure was 10 mmHg higher than con-
trols (p = 0.003). These results remained similar after controlling 
for age, gender and current blood pressure-lowering medication 
use. On the neurologic exam, we found a minority of participants 
with cranial nerve, motor, or cerebellar abnormalities, as well as

symptoms and Quality-of-life evaluation
Figures 1A–D compare results of standardized symptom ques-
tionnaires among participants with PTLDS and controls. The 
PTLDS group reported significantly higher levels of fatigue, 
pain, poor sleep quality, and depression than controls (FSS: 
50.0 ± 10.6 vs. 19.8 ± 8.6; SF-MPQ: 13.7 ± 8.3 vs. 0.8 ± 1.9; 
PSQI: 10.1 ± 4.7 vs. 4.1 ± 2.1; and BDI: 15.1 ± 7.7 vs. 2.2 ± 3.2; 
p < 0.001 for each). The proportion reporting symptom severity 
above clinically relevant cutoffs are significantly higher in the 
PTLDS group (FSS: 86.9 vs. 7.7%; SF-MPQ: 93.2 [55/59] vs. 
3.8%; PSQI: 79.3 [46/58] vs. 26.9%; BDI: 50.0 [30/60] vs. 0.0%; 
p < 0.001 for each).
Twenty-five of the 36 symptoms included on our list were 
found to be significantly different between cases and controls 
(p < 0.05; see Figure 2). Conversely, joint swelling, double vision, 
drooping facial muscle, drooping eyelid, tinnitus, heart palpita-
tions, swollen lymph nodes, vomiting, diarrhea, sore throat, and 
anxiety were not found to be statistically different for participants 
with PTLDS compared to controls. The ten symptoms with the 
highest difference in proportion reporting “moderate” or above 
by group were (in descending order); fatigue, joint pain, sleep 
difficulty, muscle pain, focusing/concentrating, neck pain, head-
ache, difficulty finding words, irritability, and low back pain.
SF-36 PCS and MCS are presented by group in Figures 1E,F. 
The average quality of life for participants with PTLDS was 
considerably worse than the population mean for physical 
(33.9 ± 9.7, p < 0.001) and mental (42.9 ± 10.1, p < 0.001) com-
ponents, with a higher proportion worse than the population 
mean of 50 for both subscales compared to controls (PCS: 93.4 
vs. 23.1%, p < 0.001, MCS: 73.8 vs. 23.1%: p < 0.001).
cDc confirmed cases vs. Probable cases
Finally, participants with PTLDS were separated into two groups 
based on whether their initial presentation met the CDC case 
definition for LD-confirmed or LD-probable (26), and these 
groups were compared on all previously reported variables. There 
were no demographic differences by group, and among the vari-
ables in Table 2, only median time from illness onset to treatment 
(14 days LD-confirmed vs. 7 months LD-probable, p = 0.004) 
and delayed or misdiagnosis (50.0% LD-confirmed vs. 79.0% 
LD-probable, p = 0.033) were statistically significant. Among the 
variables in Table 3, only the proportion IgG-WB seropositive 
differed by group (31.7% LD-confirmed vs. 68.4% LD-probable, 
p = 0.008), although this was expected as the LD-probable but 
not the LD-confirmed group was required to have prior serologic 
evidence of exposure at study enrollment. Among the standard-
ized questionnaires, the LD-probable group had worse median 
scores for sleep quality (PSQI; 12.5 vs. 9.0, p = 0.031), pain 
(SF-MPQ; 18.0 vs. 9.0, p = 0.021), and depression (18.0 vs. 12.0, 
p = 0.034). However, among the list of 36 current symptoms, the 
LD-probable group endorsed higher severity of difficulty finding 
words (p = 0.017) and irritability (p = 0.027) only.
DiscUssiOn
This study represents the first to compare patients with rigorously 
defined PTLDS to non-Lyme infected controls on a range of 
32.2% with scores below age-adjusted cutoffs for vibratory sense 
in upper or lower extremities (29). Although the proportion with 
cardiac or joint abnormalities was higher among participants 
with PTLDS compared to controls, these differences were not 
statistically significant.

clinical, laboratory, symptom, and quality-of-life parameters. We 
found that physical exam and clinical laboratory tests showed few 
abnormalities. However, standardized questionnaires revealed 
that these patients are highly symptomatic, with clinically signifi-
cantly poorer quality of life compared both to healthy controls 
and the US population. These findings were consistent regardless 
of whether participants met criteria for the initial LD-probable 
or LD-confirmed group. There was some evidence for greater 
initial misdiagnosis and more severe current symptoms among 
the LD-probable group.
Results from the physical exam and laboratory testing in 
our sample of patients with PTLDS did not show a pattern of 
significant objective abnormalities. The most notable exception 
was the higher rate of diminished vibratory sensation on physical 
exam among participants with PTLDS (32.2%), compared to the 
5% expected to fall below the age-adjusted cutoffs used in this 
analysis (29). This abnormality were not only present among 
those with a prior diagnosis of neurologic Lyme disease or a later 
diagnosis of neuropathy but also among those without a specific 
prior neurologic diagnosis. This finding was also observed in a 
previous population-based study, in which decreased vibratory 
sense was noted in 29% of a sample of individuals with prior Lyme 
disease, and was one of the sole physical exam findings to dif-
fer significantly from controls (17). Additionally, although only 
found in a small subset of our sample (3.4%), two participants 
met criteria for postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, an 
autonomic condition that has been previously reported follow-
ing Lyme disease (37). Laboratory tests, including complete blood 
count, complete metabolic count, and C-reactive protein, showed 
no significant difference between participants with PTLDS and 
controls. The rates of current two-tier IgG-WB positivity among 
those with confirmed early (7/36, 19.4%) and late (4/6, 66.7%) 
Lyme disease were similar to those found in a 10- to 20-year 
follow-up study of treated patients assessed to have good overall 
health (22), further emphasizing that current serology cannot be 
used as a diagnostic marker for PTLDS.
By contrast, participants with PTLDS reported prominent 
symptoms that are often diverse and can be moderate to severe

in nature. We expected that current symptom severity of fatigue, 
pain, and cognitive complaints would be higher among PTLDS 
participants than controls, given that presence of at least one of 
these symptoms was included in both the IDSA proposed case 
definition and our enrollment criteria. Indeed, severe levels of 
each of these were reported by 50.0 (30/6), 28.3 (17/60), and 23.3% 
(14/60) of participants with PTLDS, respectively, compared to 
none of the controls for each. Standardized questionnaire scores 
on fatigue and pain for these participants were also considerably 
worse than clinically relevant cutoffs (FSS: 55.9 ± 5.9; SF-MPQ: 
15.9 ± 6.9; p < 0.001 for both). Previous studies have suggested 
that fatigue and cognitive symptoms are common, and may be 
particularly important contributors to decreased functioning in 
this syndrome (38, 39). As Lyme disease incidence continues to 
increase in endemic regions and spread to new geographic areas 
(2), PTLDS is likely to be increasingly relevant in the differential 
diagnosis of patient-reported symptoms commonly encountered 
by the general internist.
Participants with PTLDS also reported significantly higher 
severity of an additional 19 diverse symptoms that were not 
part of the IDSA criteria but which could be diagnostically and 
clinically relevant. Among these, sleep difficulty was the most 
frequently reported current symptom, and the symptom with the 
highest difference in proportion reporting “moderate” or above 
between cases and controls, suggesting that it may be a clinically 
important component of this syndrome. Sleep difficulty has been 
previously identified in the context of Lyme disease (40), and was 
found to correlate highly with fatigue in one study (17). In our 
sample, severe sleep difficulty was reported by 31.7% (19/60) of 
participants with PTLDS and none of the controls, and their PSQI 
scores were significantly worse than the clinically relevant cutoff 
for poor sleep quality (PSQI: 14.0 ± 3.5, p < 0.001). Additionally, 
severe visual clarity issues and photophobia were reported by 5.0 
(3/60) and 8.3% (3/60) of our sample of participants with PTLDS 
respectively, compared to none of the controls. Although oph-
thalmologic signs can occur in untreated disease, persistent sub-
jective symptoms have not been described extensively in PTLDS 
(41, 42). Finally, those symptoms not statistically significantly 
different between participants with PTLDS and controls notably 
included objective signs of rheumatologic, neurologic, or ocular 
involvement (such as joint swelling, drooping facial muscle, and 
double vision) that traditionally distinguish untreated Lyme 
disease from the posttreatment phase (21, 43).
We found further evidence that the physical and mental 
health-related quality of life of patients with PTLDS is often 
lower than both controls and US population means. Poor health-
related quality-of-life baseline values were previously reported 
in both US and European treatment trials among patients with 
persistent symptoms following Lyme disease (1.5–2 SD below the 
PCS population mean and 0.5–1.5 SD below the MCS population

past 2 weeks. Displayed are the 25 signs/symptoms with a statistically significant difference in severity by group (p < 0.05), ordered by frequency within the PTLDS

mean) (23, 44). As Klempner and colleagues note, these low scores 
are comparable to patients suffering from congestive heart failure 
or osteoarthritis (23). They are also consistent with results from 
our sample, with more than half of the participants with PTLDS 
found to have SF-36 PCS that were 1.5 SD below the population 
mean, and 41.0% had MCS that were 1 SD below the population 
mean. Scores below these cutoffs were not found among any of 
the controls.
Delayed or misdiagnosis of early Lyme disease has been 
hypothesized by some to be less common in recent decades as 
knowledge of appropriate treatment regimens and serologic 
testing methods has increased (45). However, as identified in 
this study and in our previous chart review (8), these risk fac-
tors for PTLDS may still be part of the community landscape 
of Lyme disease diagnosis and treatment. In the current study, 
we found evidence of exposure to non-recommended antibiot-
ics (such as sulfamethoxazole or cephalexin), steroids, or an 
extended duration of greater than 30 days from illness onset 
to initiation of recommended treatment in 59% of the sample 
of participants with PTLDS. Notably, the rate of delayed or 
misdiagnosis was also significantly higher among those with 
initial LD-probable compared to LD-confirmed presentations 
(79 vs. 50%, p = 0.033). We hypothesize that this is due to the 
non-specific nature of the symptoms in the LD-probable group, 
which may be more frequently overlooked or attributed to viral 
illnesses.
Although our study sample was largely recruited from a 
subset of those referred to an academic referral research center 
and clinic for PTLDS, our participants’ initial Lyme disease was 
diagnosed and treated in a range of clinical settings. We chose 
a retrospective design in the current study in order to capture 
this heterogeneity, and to capitalize on a more representative 
and generalizable view of PTLDS in the community setting. 
Participants included in prospective studies are often ideally and 
uniformly treated, and limited to specific clinical presentations by 
design (46, 47). We hypothesize that such factors may contribute 
to discrepant findings in symptom severity between prospective 
studies, which tend to report milder residual symptoms following 
treatment (46, 47), and community-based retrospective studies 
such as ours and others (16, 17) that describe a higher symptom 
burden with more significant impacts on quality of life (48).
Our study is limited by the fact that no definitive biomarker 
exists either for B. burgdorferi infection or PTLDS. As such, we 
cannot be completely certain that our participants with PTLDS 
had initial signs and symptoms that were correctly attributed 
to Lyme disease at illness onset. To minimize this risk, we 
required medical record documentation to establish the initial 
signs and symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment for Lyme disease 
that adhered to the IDSA proposed case definition, which few 
prior studies have done. We also cannot be completely certain 
that these symptoms are attributable to PTLDS and not other 
co-morbidities, as was suggested by a recent publication (49).

To address this potential confounding effect, our study compared 
participants with PTLDS to a healthy control group recruited 
following the same exclusionary criteria, which included a 
range of conditions independently associated with fatigue, pain, 
and cognitive dysfunction. Furthermore, while the inclusion of 
LD-probable patients could also presumably lower specificity of 
our findings, our analysis did not find a prominent pattern of dif-
ference between LD-probable and LD-confirmed groups. Lastly, 
our study is limited by an inability to address the possibility of 
recall bias for those variables which were based on self-report and 
not medical record review.
Our comprehensive case series suggests that the patient-
reported symptoms of PTLDS and their effect on life function-
ing can be clinically significant and long-lasting, regardless of 
initial Lyme disease presentation. In the absence of a diagnostic 
biomarker, this study shows that PTLDS can be successfully 
characterized using a systematic and standardized approach to 
patient evaluation. This includes special attention to identifying 
a medical history of initial missed or delayed diagnosis of Lyme 
disease, which are potentially important risk factors for the 
development of PTLDS. We speculate that the pattern of symp-
toms identified in this study could be a tool for the diagnosis of 
PTLDS, and that well-validated symptom surveys could be used 
in the future to both identify and monitor treatment progress 
in patients with PTLDS. Physicians practicing in Lyme disease-
endemic areas need to remain alert for the diagnosis of PTLDS 
when evaluating patients with otherwise unexplained symptoms 
and prior Lyme disease.
Further research is needed to delineate specific risk factors 
for PTLDS and the mechanisms of illness in this group of 
patients in order to guide improvements in diagnostic specific-
ity and treatment options. Biosamples from this cohort of par-
ticipants will be an important resource for future investigations 
into both the identification of molecular biomarkers of disease 
and addressing potential underlying biological mechanisms 
in PTLDS. Until then, the symptoms of PTLDS, which can be 
severe and significantly impact quality of life, need to be more 
effectively identified, validated, and managed as part of inte-
grated patient care. As the prevalence of PTLDS will continue 
to rise, there will be an increasing need for physician education 
toward this end.
