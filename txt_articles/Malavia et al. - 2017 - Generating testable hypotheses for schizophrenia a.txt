Patients with schizophrenia and their relatives have reduced prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis. Schizophrenia and rheumatoid
arthritis genome-wide association studies also indicate negative genetic correlations, suggesting that there may be shared
pathogenesis at the DNA level or downstream. A portion of the inverse prevalence could be attributed to pleiotropy, i.e., variants of
a single nucleotide polymorphism that could confer differential risk for these disorders. To study the basis for such an
interrelationship, we initially compared lists of single nucleotide polymorphisms with significant genetic associations (p < 1e-8) for
schizophrenia or rheumatoid arthritis, evaluating patterns of linkage disequilibrium and apparent pleiotropic risk profiles. Single
nucleotide polymorphisms that conferred risk for both schizophrenia and rheumatoid arthritis were localized solely to the extended
HLA region. Among single nucleotide polymorphisms that conferred differential risk for schizophrenia and rheumatoid arthritis, the
majority were localized to HLA-B, TNXB, NOTCH4, HLA-C, HCP5, MICB, PSORS1C1, and C6orf10; published functional data indicate that
HLA-B and HLA-C have the most plausible pathogenic roles in both disorders. Interactomes of these eight genes were constructed
from protein–protein interaction information using publicly available databases and novel computational predictions. The genes
harboring apparently pleiotropic single nucleotide polymorphisms are closely connected to rheumatoid arthritis and schizophrenia
associated genes through common interacting partners. A separate and independent analysis of the interactomes of rheumatoid
arthritis and schizophrenia genes showed a significant overlap between the two interactomes and that they share several common
pathways, motivating functional studies suggesting a relationship in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia/rheumatoid arthritis.

INTRODUCTION
Schizophrenia (SZ) is a severe psychiatric disorder of unknown
etiology with a lifetime risk of approximately 1%. The heritability
of SZ, estimated at ~70%, is best explained by a multi-factorial
polygenic threshold model (MFPT) that invokes multiple genetic
risk factors modified by the environment.1 Ongoing genome-wide
association studies (GWAS) of SZ indicate over 100 SNPs and
relatively rare mutations of variable effect sizes, but for majority of
the loci the primary risk variants and the functions are uncertain.2
Further clarity may be gained by an integrative analyses of
genomic and proteomic data.3
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease that causes
inflammation of the small joints in the hand and feet with a
prevalence of approximately 1%. Like SZ, the etiology of RA also is
best explained by an MFPT model.4 Several studies over the past
five decades indicate an inverse prevalence of RA and SZ, i.e.,
individuals with SZ are less likely to be diagnosed with RA, and
vice versa.5–7 Children and siblings of individuals with SZ show
reduced risk of seronegative RA,8 though some reports differ.5 The
inverse prevalence of RA in patients with SZ and the reduced
familial risk of RA raise the possibility that there are shared
pathogenic processes for these disorders. A portion of the genetic
risk factors could even have pleiotropic effects, i.e., one allele
confers risk for SZ, while another variant of the same polymorph-
ism elevates risk for RA. The latter possibility was initially tested in
a relatively small under-powered candidate gene studies and
GWAS analyses that did not provide any supportive evidence.9
Recently, an analysis of larger datasets indicated a small but
statistically significant negative correlation between SZ and RA,
with stronger effect for SNPs localized to coding and regulatory
regions (correlation of −0.046 and −0.174, respectively); these
analyses are supported by genetic correlations of a similar
magnitude even with GWAS score statistics in lieu of individual-
level genotype data.10 Thus, it may be worthwhile to search for
individual genetic risk factors with pleiotropic effects on SZ/RA.
In a broader framework, the epidemiologic data also motivate a
search for shared pathogenic processes. Interactome analysis is a
useful approach for discovering novel functional associations of
genes. In the present study, we sought individual SNPs with
plausible pleiotropic risks and explored their functions through in
silico analyses, including interactome analyses, to search for links
to shared pathology. We identified several leads that could
motivate further hypothesis-driven functional studies.

 RESULTS
To study the molecular and genetic interrelation between
rheumatoid arthritis and schizophrenia, we carried out two
parallel and independent analyses. The first one was to identify
the SNPs that potentially have pleiotropic effects, and the second
one was to study the protein interactomes of the genes associated
with the two diseases. For the parallel (independent) interactome
analyses, we computed novel protein–protein interactions (PPIs)
using
high-confidence
protein–protein
interaction
prediction
(HiPPIP) method that we previously developed.11 Additionally, to
accelerate future studies of functional mechanisms of genes
containing pleotropic SNPs, we also computed their novel PPIs.
Identification of risk SNPs with apparent pleiotropic effects
The following cascaded analysis of SNPs associated with RA and
SZ was carried out to identify pairs of SNPs with strong linkage
disequilibrium (LD), such that they conferred risk in opposite
directions for the two disorders. A search for pairs of SNPs (r, z)
where r is significantly associated with RA and z with SZ, and r and
z are in strong LD, yielded 1376 pairs of SNPs; all of which were
located in the extended HLA region in chromosome 6p. Of these,
46 pairs were identified as having alleles that conferred risk in
opposite directions for RA and SZ (Supplementary File 1). Of these,
29 pairs consisted of SNPs with putative pleiotropic effects (i.e, r
and z were found to refer to the same SNP but with opposing
odds ratios in RA versus SZ GWAS), 18 of which were located
within gene regions including exonic, intronic and flanking
regions, and 11 were not within gene regions using these criteria
(see Methods). These 18 SNPs were located to the following 8
genes: TNXB, HLA-B, HLA-C, NOTCH4, HCP5, MICB, PSORS1C1 and
C6orf10 (Table 1). We refer to these 8 as Genes Associated with
Putative Pleiotropic SNPs (GAPPS). Four of these genes contain
SNPS with pleiotropic effects in their exonic regions: rs915894 in
NOTCH4, rs2073045 in C6orf10, rs1050420 in HLA-C and rs709055,
rs12721827, and rs1131163 in HLA-B.
Expression of GAPPS
After identifying the 8 GAPPS as described above, we analyzed
their expression patterns in different tissues by searching public
databases. We studied their expression first in the brain regions
under the assumption that it is likely the site for key SZ pathology
and then, we also evaluated expression in the following immune-
related cells: Epstein Barr virus (EBV)-transformed lymphocytes,
spleen, and whole blood. The following brain regions were
evaluated: amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex, caudate, cerebellar
hemisphere, cerebellum, cortex, frontal cortex, hippocampus,
hypothalamus, nucleus accumbens, putamen, spinal cord cervical
c1, and substantia nigra. Of the 8 GAPPS, HLA-C and HLA-B were
consistently expressed in all brain regions, while the expression of
TNXB, NOTCH4, MICB, PSORS1C1, and HCP5 was much lower.
C6orf10 was not expressed in the brain. In EBV-transformed
lymphocytes, spleen, and whole blood, the expression of HLA-C,
HLA-B, and HCP5 has been noted consistently, whereas TNXB,
NOTCH4, and MICB are less consistently expressed in all three
tissues. PSORS1C1 has minimal expression in the lymphocytes and
spleen and is not expressed in whole blood. C6orf10 is not
expressed in any of the these tissues.12 Expression patterns were
not used to further filter GAPPS.
Interactome analyses
Analysis of the network of PPIs (or “interactome”) can reveal
higher level functional relations among genes, which may not be
apparent by analyzing the genes in isolation.11 For example, we
recently studied the relation between SZ-risk genes that were
identified through GWAS and those that were considered to be
associated with SZ in pre-GWAS era, and showed that although
they shared only one common gene, they had several common
interactors, and that their interactomes shared common functional
pathways.11 We constructed the interactomes of genes associated
with RA as identified through GWAS (“RA genes”, “RA inter-
actome”),13 and genes associated with SZ through GWAS (“SZ
genes”, “SZ interactome”),11, 14 and analyzed the interconnections
between them. We also constructed the interactome of GAPPS
and analyzed how closely they are connected to the RA and SZ

 genes. To construct the interactomes, we included previously
known PPIs and also novel PPIs that were discovered using our
HiPPIP model.11 The novel PPIs were shown to be highly accurate
based
on
computational
and
experimental
evaluations
as
described in our prior work.11
The RA interactome consists of 98 RA genes and 1960
interactors, connected by 598 novel PPIs and 2232 known PPIs.
Similarly, the SZ interactome consists of 77 SZ genes and 968
interactors, connected by 365 novel PPIs and 814 known PPIs.
There are 316 genes in common between the RA and SZ
interactomes, including direct PPIs between 7 RA genes and 6 SZ
genes (Fig. 1 and Supplementary File 2), which is statistically
highly significant (p < 10−72, hypergeometric distribution test). A
subset of the interactome that highlights the inter-connections
between RA and SZ genes mediated by novel PPIs is shown in
Fig. 1. A complete list of PPIs that connect SZ and RA genes either
directly or through a single intermediate interactor to each other
are given in Supplementary File 2. This also includes a number of
novel PPIs of RA genes, whereas novel PPIs of SZ genes were
presented in our earlier work described above.11 The PPIs and the
genes are clearly labeled as novel or known and also by their
membership in the two interactomes.
The interactome of the GAPPS (Fig. 2a) consisted of 8 GAPPS
(dark blue nodes) connected to 33 novel interactors (red nodes) and
50 known interactors (light blue nodes) through 36 novel PPIs (red
lines or “edges”) and 54 known PPIs (blue edges). One novel PPI

 shows that C6orf10 and HCP5 interact directly. Three of these
genes had no known interactions except one PPI connecting HCP5
to APP, but we predicted 9 novel PPIs. Even for NOTCH4, HLA-B
and HLA-C, which are well-studied genes with several known PPIs,
we predicted additional novel PPIs for each. The GAPPS do not
directly interact with any of the RA or SZ associated genes, but
they connect to 32 RA genes (Fig. 2b: gold nodes) and 10 SZ genes
(green nodes) through 27 common interactors (grey nodes).
Next, we studied the pathways associated with the RA and SZ
interactomes separately using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis® (IPA)
suite (www.ingenuity.com). There are several pathways common
to both the interactomes (Supplementary File 1). The commonality
arises from not only the shared genes between the interactomes,
but also from additional genes that are exclusive to either
interactome (see selected pathways in Table 2). To highlight this
aspect, we show in Fig. 3, the top 30 pathways associated with SZ
interactome and the number of genes that are associated with
each pathway that are exclusive and common to the two
interactomes. For example, the glucocorticoid receptor signaling
pathway is associated with 33 proteins from both interactomes, 80
proteins exclusive to RA interactome, and 14 proteins exclusive to
SZ interactome.
In another analysis using NextBio suite of tools,15 we analyzed
gene expression patterns in schizophrenia and rheumatoid
arthritis, and found a negative correlation between them: i.e.,
some genes that are over-expressed in one disorder are under-
expressed in the other. For example, the gene expression data
from neurons of SZ patients and synovial tissues of RA patients
showed that there
are 58
genes upregulated in SZ and
downregulated in RA, and 48 genes are downregulated in SZ
and upregulated in RA. We found 5 datasets that show a similar
relationship between these diseases (Supplementary File 4).
Overall, there were 369 such genes with opposite expression in
the two diseases. Of these, 101 were found to among the SZ and
RA interactomes, and pathway analysis showed that they are
related to chemokine receptor signaling, signaling of IL-15, IL-12,
IL-2, and IL-6 and Natural Killer Cell Signaling pathways, among
others. Seven of them were found to be novel interactors of the SZ
genes (ALDH6A1, FBLN1, MYL9, NKG7, RGS1, SETBP1, and
SYNGR1), and twenty were novel interactors of RA genes
(ARHGAP6, BMP4, CADM3, CYR61, DIO3, EFEMP1, GMPR, GNPDA1,
IRF9, KCNMA1, MGST3, MX1, NET1, PEX6, RAB31, RAP2A, SGCE,
SPP1, UAP1, and ZFP36L1); of these, EFEMP1 and SPP1 are also
known interactors of SZ. Some studies identified SPP1 as an RA-
susceptibility gene and hence this novel interactor may have a
role in RA pathogenesis. These interactome analyses further
strengthen the link between rheumatoid arthritis and schizo-
phrenia, and also highlight the functional significance of novel
predicted interactors in the disease processes.
We used this 369 gene signature to query large scale
perturbagen signatures (L1000 profiles) from the NIH’s Library of
Integrated
Network-based
Cellular
Signatures
(LINCS—www.
lincscloud.org)
to
identify
small
molecules
that
could
be
potentially therapeutic for SZ or RA. Among the top compounds
were both known and investigational compounds used for RA (e.g.
bortezomib) or SZ (e.g., trifluoperazine, ropinirole) (Supplementary
File 5). By studying the expression signatures associated with gene
knockdown (i.e., gene perturbagens) in LINCS database, we found
that there are 150 genes whose knockdown signature correlates
with the observed signature of differential expression. Of these
150, about one-third were included in the interactomes.
DISCUSSION
Mounting data supports the pathophysiological importance of
neuroinflammation in SZ.16–25 SZ postmortem studies note
activated microglia/macrophages,16, 20, 26 elevated expression of
inflammatory markers in the prefrontal cortex neurons27 and
vasculature,28 and autoantibodies against frontal,29 cingulate,29–31
hippocampal cortices,30 and glutamate receptors.32 Autoimmune
disorders may elevate the risk for SZ both independently33, 34 and
in combination with infections.33 A meta-analysis noted elevated
peripheral blood inflammatory cytokines in SZ compared to
healthy controls.35 Genome-wide association studies replicate the
association of variants in the major histocompatibility complex
region (where a large number of immune genes are located) with
SZ.36–39
Non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory
drugs
may
reduce
psychotic symptom severity.40–42 We noted anatomical dyscon-
nections43 and increased neuropil pruning44 associated with
peripheral inflammatory markers suggesting possible mechanisms
through which inflammation may underlie schizophrenia patho-
genesis. While there is ample evidence for such correlations, to our
knowledge, there are no biological data that directly support the
relation between SZ and RA. We have utilized an in silico cross-
disciplinary approach to determine the possible focal points of
such relation.
We initially identified GWAS SNPs to find those that show
apparent pleiotropic effects on risk for SZ and RA based on the
inverse epidemiological relationship between the two diseases
and prior indicated negative correlations for genetic risk.8, 10 The
SNP-based analyses identified 29 SNPs, of which 11 were localized
to intergenic regions and 18 were localized to genes including
their flanking regions. As one of the goals of our study was to
identify genes with high probability of involvement in SZ
pathology that could be investigated further in subsequent
studies, we conducted additional in silico analyses of 18 SNPs
within genes or their flanking regions (Table 1), recognizing that
the SNPs in intergenic regions continue to be of interest and
deserve functional analyses. Through the location of the 18
putative pleiotropic SNPs, we identified GAPPS and constructed
their interactomes. In parallel, and independent of the hypotheses
based on pleiotropic effects, we carried out interactome analyses
of RA and SZ genes to find network and pathway relations
between the two diseases. To our knowledge, such analyses
relating SZ and RA have not been conducted before.
All the SNPs with putative pleiotropic effects were localized to
the extended HLA region. Associations of SZ and RA in this region
have been known for over four decades and have also been
confirmed through GWAS.45, 46 As there is extensive LD in this
gene-rich region and the risk attributable to individual variants is
relatively small, it has been difficult to identify primary risk
variants. Recently, a portion of the risk in the HLA region has been
attributed to relatively frequent copy-number variation (CNV)
spanning
the
C4A-C4B
complement
genes,
and
the
gene
expression analysis of post-mortem tissues from several brain
regions indicated that the C4A gene is over expressed among
patients with
schizophrenia.47
These
analyses
also
indicate
additional, independently acting risk variants in the HLA region.47
Similarly, our analyses pointed to additional SNPs in HLA that
should be explored further. To enable functional studies of C4A
gene, we computed the interactome of C4A, and found that it has
6 novel interactors (Fig. 2c). C4A shares two common interactors
(APC and ATF6B) with RA genes and one common interactor (APC)
with SZ genes.
As the precise functional effects of the putative pleiotropic SNPs
is unknown, we sought genes that might be impacted by such
variation. Our analyses identified eight GAPP genes, of which HLA-
B and HLA-C appear to have the greatest amount of published
data relating to SZ or RA pathogenesis. Previous studies have
shown genetic associations of HLA-B in both rheumatoid arthritis
and schizophrenia. Allele HLA B27 has been associated with
several types of arthritis disorders such as ankylosing spondylitis,
reactive arthritis and psoriatic arthritis.48 Other studies have
shown that similarity in certain regions of the HLA-B gene
between the mother and the daughter give an increased risk of
schizophrenia to the daughter.49 Aside from genetic associations,

 HLA-B may play a role in the two diseases by its involvement in
the natural killer cell pathway. Natural killer cells (NKCs) are found
to have low activity per cell in rheumatoid arthritis, as opposed to
a high activity per cell found in schizophrenic patients.50,
51
However, other studies indicate that the lower activity is due to a
lower number of circulating NKCs. NKC activity in schizophrenia
patients, on the other hand, is elevated. Homozygosity in multiple
alleles in the HLA-B gene is thought to lower NKC activity that has
been associated with rheumatoid arthritis.52–54 The HLA-C protein
is thought to act as a ligand for the killer immunoglobulin
receptors found on NKC, thus acting as an NKC inhibitor and
regulating their activity.55 Some polymorphisms in HLA-C are
thought to cause a decreased risk of rheumatoid arthritis, while
other studies indicate that polymorphisms in this gene cause an
increased risk of schizophrenia.56, 57 The pleiotropic associations
with HLA-C polymorphisms, the opposite activity levels of NKCs in
the two diseases and their association with HLA-B, makes these
genes prime candidates for further research. Among the remain-
ing genes, MICB encodes for a stress-induced protein that is a
ligand for the NKG2D Type 2 receptor, which is located on NKCs,
CD8 alpha/beta T cells, and gamma/delta T cells. HCP5 denotes the
HLA complex protein P5, and while located in the HLA region, it is
not similar in sequence to the other HLA genes. It is more similar
to the human endogenous retroviruses HERV-L and HERV-16.
Tenascin XB (TNXB) is a member of the extracellular matrix
glycoproteins
and
several
genetic
association
studies
have
indicated TNXB SNPs as risk factors for SZ, but similar associations
with RA have not been reported, to our knowledge. NOTCH4, a
transmembrane protein mediating the Notch signaling pathway,
regulates interactions between adjacent neurons. Multiple genetic
association studies have associated NOTCH4 with schizophrenia
and rheumatoid arthritis, but their functional implications are
uncertain.58, 36
Using interactome analysis, we found that the eight GAPPS
share common interacting partners with RA and SZ genes (Fig. 2b).
It also showed that even though RA and SZ do not share common
risk genes beyond the HLA region, they have 316 common
interacting partners through PPIs (Fig. 1 and Supplementary
File 2). There are even direct PPIs between RA and SZ genes: 7 RA
genes and 6 SZ genes interact with each other. Two of the RA
genes, namely CSF2 and UNG, are novel interactors of SZ genes.
One of the subunits of CSF2 (CSF2RB) is essential for IL3 signaling
which is involved in schizophrenia pathology.59 Similarly, the SZ
genes ATP2A2 and ETF1 are novel interactors of RA genes.
The parallel analyses of the SZ and the RA interactomes
indicated that there are several pathways that are common to,
and significantly associated with both the disorders, though it is
likely that some of these pathways are disrupted in other disorders
(Fig. 3 and Supplementary File 2). We found several pathways that
are associated with immune function and inflammation. For
example, pathways such as role of NFAT in regulation of immune
response has 43 common genes, IL-8 signaling has 27 genes,
CD28 signaling in T-Helper cells has 15 genes, natural killer cell
signaling has 17 genes, crosstalk between dendritic cells and natural
killer cells has 6 genes, NF-kB signaling has 21 genes and B cell
receptor signaling has 27 common genes. Prior studies suggested
that interleukins may be associated with schizophrenia pathol-
ogy.60 The NF-kB signaling pathway may also have an important
role because NF-kB molecule has key role in immune response
regulation and is associated with RA pathology; it has also been
implicated in synaptic plasticity and memory, which are com-
monly altered in schizophrenia patients.61, 62 The PPIs, including
novel PPIs that we predicted, highlight how the RA and SZ genes
connect to pathways that are of interest in the biology of both the
diseases (examples shown in Table 2). All these pathways have
highly significant associations with both interactomes, though it is

 recognized that some of these pathways are likely involved in
other disorders (Supplementary File 2).
Some limitations of the present work should be noted. In
addition to pleiotropy, there are undoubtedly other mechanisms
for the inverse prevalence of SZ and RA that need to be explored.
Our studies were solely in silico, and need to be verified through
experiments. Genetic risk variants with pleiotropic effects, which
were not within genes or their flanking regions, were not explored
further (Supplementary File 1). Other variants such as a CNV on
C4A could not be analyzed in detail.47 The functional implications
of the novel PPIs predicted for C4A (Fig. 2c), especially those that
have links to both RA and SZ genes, should be studied further.
It could be argued that instead of evaluating effects of risk SNPs
in function of their respective genes, one ought to evaluate their
effects on the overall “output” of the respective pathways. Our
studies motivate these and similar studies. A related question that
would need to be addressed is the impact of such changes on the
“end organs” for SZ and RA, i.e., the brain and the joints,
respectively.
In conclusion, we integrated epidemiological, GWAS, gene
expression and proteomic data to identify genes and pathways
with potential pathogenic relevance for both SZ and RA. We
recommend avenues for further functional analyses based on
these hypotheses.
METHODS
Identifying SNPs with putative pleiotropic effects
The overview of the procedure for identifying SNPs with putative
pleiotropic effects is shown in Fig. 4. We used publicly available SNP level
summary
statistics
from
large
scale
GWAS
of
schizophrenia
and
rheumatoid arthritis. The SZ dataset included results from 36,989 cases
and 113,075 controls for approximately 9.5 million SNPs.14 The RA dataset
included results from 29,880 cases and 73,758 controls for approximately
9.7 million SNPs.13
The analysis started with the selection of candidate RA SNPs, where our
goal was to prepare a list of SNPs that are not highly correlated with each
other and would individually confer statistically significant risk at genome-
wide levels. We combined linkage disequilibrium (LD) pruning with p-value
thresholding (p < 10−8) on the RA dataset using ‘Swiss’ software (www.
github.com/welchr/Swiss). LD between pairs of SNPs was calculated based
on 1000 Genomes data (phase II, Caucasian ancestry sample),63 with a
threshold of r2 ≤ 0.6 to identify a relatively independent set of RA SNPs.
Each of these highly significant and low-LD RA SNPs was paired with each
of the SZ SNPs in the initial GWAS list. Out of these, we selected the pairs
that had an LD value of r2 ≥ 0.8 between them, resulting in 1376 SNP pairs.
When multiple SZ SNPs matched the same RA SNP, the pair with the
highest LD between them and the lowest p-value for the SZ SNP was
chosen; this resulted in 290 pairs of SNPs.
The odds ratios (OR) and reference alleles of the resulting pairs were
then examined as given in the original summary statistics, to identify those
which had opposite odds ratios (i.e., where SNP of one disorder had OR < 1
and the SNP of the other disorder had OR > 1).64 This resulted in 46 (r, z)
SNP pairs.
In the analysis thus far, for the SNP pair (r, z), SNP r was picked for its
effect on RA and z for its effect on SZ; but we also verified that the odds
ratio of r for RA and r for SZ are in opposite directions, and vice versa for z.
This was found to be applicable only where r and z referred to the same
SNP but not otherwise. Thus, at the end of the analysis, there were 29
individual SNPs with opposing effects on the two diseases.
These SNPs were mapped to gene boundaries including 5000 base
upstream and downstream flanking regions, as given in the Known
Canonical Genes track of UCSC Genome Browser for the human genome
build hg19 (GRCh37).65 This resulted in 18 SNPs. Only these 18 SNPs that
were localized within gene boundaries were considered for further
analysis. The genes within which these 18 SNPs were located are referred
to as GAPPS.
Expression analysis of GAPPS
The GTEx browser was used to analyze tissue expression for the 8 GAPPS.12
Interactome construction and analysis
The interactomes were assembled by collecting known PPIs from the
Human Protein Reference Database66 and Biological General Repository for
Interaction Datasets,67 and by computing novel PPIs using the HiPPIP
model that we developed.11 The predicted PPIs have been shown to be
highly accurate by computational evaluations and experimental validations
of a few PPIs in our earlier work.11 Interactome figures were created using
Cytoscape.68 Pathways associated with proteins in RA interactome and SZ
interactome were collected separately using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis®
suite (www.ingenuity.com). All the proteins including candidates, known
and novel interactors that are present in each interactome were loaded
into IPA suite, which returns all the pathways associated with any of the
genes and the list of those genes, and the statistical significance of
association computed with Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple
SNPs from RA GWAS (n=9.7 million)

an upper bound for the expected fraction of falsely rejected null

Supplementary File 3 shows all pathways associated with any gene(s)
from the interactomes irrespective of the statistical significance of
association so that readers can use the supplementary data to not only
identify significantly associated pathways (by choosing a stringent p-value
threshold) and also to query individual genes for their functional/pathway
associations
irrespective of
that
pathway being significant
in the
interactome; for example, novel interactors of SZ genes PRKAG1, PRKAR1B
and two other known interactors are found to be involved in sonic
hedgehog signaling pathway, which may be useful to know although that
pathway is not statistically significant in the overall interactome.
The list of pathways associated with each of the two interactomes
were merged using a computer program to present clearly which of the
two interactomes the genes of associated with the pathway belonged to,
how many genes from each interactome were associated with that
pathway, and what the B-H corrected P-value of significance was for that
pathway with each interactome. While a selected few pathways are shown
in Table 2, a full list is given in Supplementary File 3. The pathways shown
in Table 2 and Fig. 3 are statistically significant (p-value < 10–6), where-
as Supplementary File 3 shows all pathways associated with any gene(s)
from the interactomes irrespective of the statistical significance of
association.
NextBio is a suite of tools that enables the study of correlated effect of
diseases and/or drugs on gene expression using publicly available gene
expression data.15 We used this in an independent analysis to identify
genes that were overexpressed in one disease (either RA or SZ) and under-
expressed in the other. We queried the genes in this RA–SZ reciprocal
expression against the LINCS database (http://www.lincscloud.org/), a
massive catalog of differential gene-expression profiles of human cells
resulting from treatment with chemical and genetic perturbagens. With
this, we identified gene knockouts and chemical compounds which result
in differential gene expression pattern that correlates with RA (anti-
correlation with SZ) or correlates with SZ (anti-correlation with RA).
