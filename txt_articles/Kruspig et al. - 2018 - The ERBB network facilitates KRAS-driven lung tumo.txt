KRAS is the most frequently mutated driver oncogene in human adenocarcinoma of the lung. There are presently 
no clinically proven strategies for treatment of KRAS-driven lung cancer. Activating mutations in KRAS are thought 
to confer independence from upstream signaling; however, recent data suggest that this independence may not 
be absolute. We show that initiation and progression of KRAS-driven lung tumors require input from ERBB family 
receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs): Multiple ERBB RTKs are expressed and active from the earliest stages of KRAS- 
driven lung tumor development, and treatment with a multi-ERBB inhibitor suppresses formation of KRASG12D-driven 
lung tumors. We present evidence that ERBB activity amplifies signaling through the core RAS pathway, supporting 
proliferation of KRAS-mutant tumor cells in culture and progression to invasive disease in vivo. Brief pharmaco-
logical inhibition of the ERBB network enhances the therapeutic benefit of MEK (mitogen-activated protein kinase 
kinase) inhibition in an autochthonous tumor setting. Our data suggest that lung cancer patients with KRAS-driven 
disease may benefit from inclusion of multi-ERBB inhibitors in rationally designed treatment strategies.
INTRODUCTION
Cancers of the lung account for more than 1.5 million deaths per an-
num worldwide, and 5-year survival rates remain between 10 and 15% 
in many developed countries (1). The majority of lung cancers are 
classified as non–small cell (NSCLC), and adenocarcinoma is the most 
common histological subtype of NSCLC. Activating mutations in KRAS 
occur in a third of lung adenocarcinoma (LuAd) cases (2). RAS proteins 
have historically proven to be elusive targets for selective inhibition, 
although the recent development of G12 mutant KRAS-selective tool 
compounds suggests that therapeutic targeting of KRAS may, in time, 
be possible (3, 4). In the interim, there is a pressing need to develop al-
ternative strategies for more effective treatment of KRAS-driven disease.
The ERBB family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) is composed 
of four members—EGFR (ERBB1), HER2 (ERBB2, NEU), ERBB3, 
and ERBB4—all of which can homo- or heterodimerize, and dimeriza-
tion is required for signaling activity. ERBB dimers are activated upon 
binding a spectrum of soluble ligands including EGF, epiregulin (EREG), 
amphiregulin (AREG), and neuregulin (NRG), together forming a 
network for ERBB-driven signal transduction (5). EGFR is a well- 
recognized driver of LuAd, with genetic alterations present in up to 
18% of cases (2). ERBB2 and ERBB3 are highly expressed in embry-
onic lungs of humans and rodents, and expression of both persists 
into adulthood (6, 7). Overexpression of ERBB2 in the absence of 
gene amplification is common in human LuAd (8, 9), and functional-
ity of ERBB2/ERBB3 heterodimers in NSCLC-derived cell lines was 
previously shown (10). Amplification of any of the four ERBB RTKs 
is associated with poor prognosis in lung cancer (11), and high ex-
pression of the promiscuous ERBB ligand EREG has previously been 
linked to disease progression and aggressive phenotypes in models 
of EGFR- and KRAS-driven lung cancer (12, 13).
In a wild-type setting, ligand-activated signaling through ERBB 
RTKs activates KRAS (14). Mutation of KRAS is generally thought 
to confer independence from upstream regulation, a view that is re-
inforced by the mutual exclusivity of activating mutations in KRAS 
and EGFR in LuAd, and by the failure of EGFR-selective inhibitors 
to show therapeutic benefit against KRAS-driven cancers (15, 16). 
However, several recent results suggest that the independence of mu-
tant KRAS from upstream signaling may not be absolute: In KRAS- 
mutant NSCLC cell lines, activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase 
(PI3K) is contingent upon basal activity of wild-type insulin-like growth 
factor receptor (IGFR), establishing an important precedent for coordi-
nation of oncogenic and normal signal transduction (17); genetic dele-
tion of EGFR was shown to suppress development of KRASG12D-driven 
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (18, 19); induced expression of 
ERBB2 and ERBB3 was found to underlie resistance of KRAS-mutant 
lung and colorectal cell lines to MEK (mitogen-activated protein kinase 
kinase) inhibition (20). Strikingly, in the latter study, MEK inhibitor– 
induced ERBB2/3 expression was associated with recovery of extra-
cellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation downstream 
of KRAS, suggesting a surprising role for upstream signaling in sus-
taining pathway activity despite the presence of activated KRAS.
We therefore examined the requirement for ERBB activity in an 
inducible model of progressive autochthonous LuAd, driven by the 
combination of endogenously expressed KRASG12D and modest over-
expression of c-MYC. We present evidence that redundant signal 
transduction through multiple ERBB RTKs supports development 
and progression of mutant KRAS-driven lung tumors. Our data sug-
gest that frontline use of multi-ERBB inhibitors may show clinical 
benefit in KRAS-driven LuAd.
RESULTS
ERBB activity is required for KRasG12D-driven lung  
tumor formation
Induced expression of ERBB family RTKs is associated with resist-
ance of KRAS-mutant NSCLC cell lines to MEK inhibition (20). We

therefore examined expression of ERBB RTKs and their ligands in mi-
crodissected early-stage lung tumors, using a CRE-inducible mouse 
model of autochthonous LuAd driven by KRASG12D combined with 
modestly increased MYC (lsl-KRasG12D;Rosa26-lsl-MYC—henceforth 
KM), the latter expressed from the Rosa26 locus in amounts that alone 
fail to provoke a phenotype (fig. S1A). In tumor samples harvested 
6 weeks after allele activation, we found strong expression of Erbb2 
and Erbb3 mRNA, whereas Egfr was weakly expressed, and Erbb4 was 
not detected in tumors from two of four KM mice (Fig. 1A). Multiple 
ERBB ligands were expressed, with Areg, Tgf, and Hbegf showing 
strongest expression, whereas Egf, Ereg, Nrg3, and Nrg4 were also clearly 
detected (Fig. 1B). The presence of both RTKs and multiple cognate 
ligands suggested that ERBB RTKs may actively signal in developing 
KRASG12D-driven lung tumors. Lysates prepared directly from mul-
tiple individual tumors, harvested 6 weeks after induction and im-
munoblotted for phospho-ERBB RTKs, consistently showed readily 
detectable phospho-EGFR, phospho-ERBB2, and phospho-ERBB3, 
suggesting that these RTKs are active in developing KRASG12D-driven 
lung tumors (Fig. 1C and fig. S1B). To determine whether ERBB sig-
naling functionally contributes to tumor development, we treated 
tumor-bearing mice acutely with a multi-ERBB inhibitor, neratinib 
(21). Treatment of mice for 3 days with neratinib suppressed activity 
of ERBB RTKs, reduced tumor cell proliferation, and increased apop-
tosis, suggesting that ERBB activity promotes growth of KRASG12D- 
driven tumors (Fig. 1, D to F). Continuous daily treatment of mice from 
2 weeks after allele induction almost completely suppressed the emer-
gence of tumors, indicating that the combination of endogenously 
expressed KRASG12D and constitutively expressed MYC requires input 
from ERBB RTKs to give rise to lung tumors (Fig. 1, G and H). In con-
trast, daily erlotinib treatment failed to show the same effect, consistent 
with reports that EGFR inhibition in isolation is ineffective in KRAS- 
driven lung cancer (15, 18).
Progression of KRas-driven lung tumors is associated with 
increased ERBB network expression
The above analysis was performed on tumors at 5 to 6 weeks after 
adeno-CRE–mediated allele activation. At this time after induction, 
the lungs of all induced KM mice contained dozens of individual tu-
mors that presented with uniform histology resembling human papil-
lary adenocarcinoma in situ (Fig. 2A, left panels). A small minority of 
tumors (2 to 5%) also contained a second, more disorganized popula-
tion with more aggressive histological features, including increased 
cytosolic and nuclear volume, prominent nucleoli, and increased mor-
phological heterogeneity (Fig. 2A, right panels). IHC analysis revealed 
continuous expression of the type II pneumocyte marker SPC across 
both populations in individual tumors, suggesting that the second pop-
ulation represents the emergence of aggressive subclones (fig. S1C). 
Progression of KRASG12D-driven lung tumors to more aggressive dis-
ease is associated with a pronounced increase in ERK1/2 phosphorylation 
(22, 23). Accordingly, IHC analysis of phospho- 
ERK (p-ERK) revealed 
much higher expression of p-ERK in these disorganized subclones com-
pared with the rest of the same tumors and across the entire tumor pop-
ulation (Fig. 2, A and B). By comparison, KM tumors harvested at 4 to 
6 months after induction showed widespread expression of p-ERK, be-
cause these more aggressive subclones gradually came to predominate 
(Fig. 2B, bottom panel). Moreover, KM metastases to the liver also show 
high amounts of epithelial p-ERK staining (Fig. 2, C to F).
Increased p-ERK was previously shown to be associated with ampli-
fication of the mutant KRas locus in a KP lung cancer model, wherein 
KRASG12D expression was combined with loss of functional p53 (24). 
We used laser-capture microdissection coupled with RNA-seq lysis to 
compare gene expression in p-ERKLow with p-ERKHigh KM tumor re-
gions from four individual mice (see schematic, fig. S1D). Expression of 
KRas was modestly higher (less than twofold) in p-ERKHigh tumor re-
gions, suggesting that locus amplification is not the underlying driver 
of progression in the KM model (Fig. 3A). However, we detected a 
sharp increase in expression of promiscuous ERBB family ligands, Ereg 
and Areg, along with more modest increases in Hbegf and Tgf (Fig. 3, 
B to D, and fig. S1E). Increased expression of Ereg and Areg was previ-
ously reported to be associated with more aggressive tumors in an in-
ducible model of KRAS-driven mammary cancer (25) and in human 
NSCLC cells enriched for metastatic behavior (26). In situ hybridiza-
tion (ISH) revealed a clear overlap between expression of Ereg, Areg, 
and extensive phosphorylation of ERK (by IHC) in tumor epithelium, 
confirming the RNA-seq data (Fig. 3C and fig. S2, A and B). The same 
phenotype of focal progression to p-ERKhigh accompanied by markedly 
increased Areg expression was also observed in primary lung tumors 
upon induction with a more lineage-restricted adeno-SPC-CRE (fig. 
S2, A and B), and in liver metastases after induction with the standard 
adeno-CMV-CRE (Fig. 3D and fig. S2C), arguing against the possi-
bility that this phenotype might arise from inadvertent activation of 
the driver oncogenes in other lung-resident populations (27). In ad-
dition, RNA-seq analysis revealed increased expression of Adam9 and 
Adam10 sheddases, which process membrane-bound ERBB ligands 
into their more potent soluble forms (28); increased expression of the 
signaling scaffold Iqgap2; and increased expression of LamC2, Fabp5, 
and Keratin19, all recently shown to enhance signaling through EGFR/
ERBB family RTKs (26, 29, 30). Expression of Erbb2 and Erbb3 was not 
significantly changed in p-ERKHigh regions (Fig. 3, E and F).
These data suggest an alternative route to increased RAS pathway 
signaling that does not require KRas amplification but rather involves 
increased activity of the ERBB network, defined here as consisting of 
ERBB ligands, RTKs, and RTK accessory molecules such as LamC2 and 
Fabp5. Notably, examination of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) 
LuAd data set via cBioPortal (31) revealed overexpression and/or am-
plification of one or more constituents of the ERBB network in the 
majority of KRAS-mutant human LuAd (fig. S3).
ERBB signaling amplifies RAS pathway activity in  
KRAS-mutant human NSCLC cells
Combined inhibition of both EGFR and ERBB2 is required to pre-
vent outgrowth of MEK inhibitor–resistant clones of human KRAS- 
mutant NSCLC cells; however, the effect of multi-ERBB inhibition 
on treatment-naïve cells was not previously explored (20). Treatment 
of multiple KRAS-mutant human NSCLC lines with the multi-ERBB 
inhibitor neratinib suppressed proliferation in a dose-dependent man-
ner (Fig. 4A). In contrast, inhibition of EGFR in isolation showed 
little effect. Immunoblotting confirmed that the doses of neratinib 
used strongly suppressed activity of ERBB RTKs (Fig. 4B). Consistent 
with previous reports that neratinib drives increased ERBB turn-
over (32), ERBB2 and ERBB3 protein expression was also reduced by 
neratinib in multiple cell lines. Despite the presence of G12 mutant 
KRAS in all such cells, neratinib consistently reduced p-ERK, whereas 
effects on AKT and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 
(STAT3) varied across the cell lines tested (Fig. 4B and fig. S4A). We 
therefore examined RAF binding as a direct measure of RAS signal-
ing activity in A549 cells, which are homozygous for mutant KRAS. 
Acute ERBB inhibition reduced both total RAS:RAF and specific

KRAS:RAF binding by >50%, consistent with the observed partial 
reduction in p-ERK (Fig. 4C). In addition, murine lung tumor cells 
carrying a spontaneously amplified KRasG12D allele also showed sen-
sitivity to neratinib, albeit somewhat lower than that of cells carrying 
a single copy of the allele (fig. S4B), and RAS-less mouse embryonic 
fibroblasts (MEFs) reconstituted with G12D mutant KRAS were like-
wise sensitive to neratinib, albeit less so than those reconstituted with 
wild-type KRAS (fig. S4, C and D). Together, these results suggest 
that ERBB amplifies signaling through the core RAS→ERK module, 
even in cells with activating mutation of KRAS, whereas sensitivity 
to ERBB suppression is imparted through both mutant and wild-
type KRAS.
To gain further mechanistic insight into the growth inhibitory 
effects of neratinib, we performed unbiased transcriptomic analysis 
after overnight treatment of three KRAS-mutant NSCLC cell lines. 
Metacore GeneGO pathway analysis revealed a remarkable degree of 
consistency across the three cell lines tested. Moreover, 18 of the 20 
most highly modulated pathways associated with progression of mu-
rine KM tumors to p-ERKHigh disease were reciprocally modulated in 
the human cells upon neratinib treatment (Fig. 4D and table S1). In

all three cell lines, ERBB inhibition reduced expression of the same 
ERBB ligands that increased as KM tumors progressed to p-ERKHigh 
disease (Fig. 4E). These findings indicate that ERBB activity estab-
lishes a feed-forward loop that sustains KRAS-mutant NSCLC pro-
liferation in vitro and drives tumor progression in vivo at least in part 
by amplifying signaling through the core RAS-ERK module.
ERBB inhibition enhances the potency of MEK inhibition  
in vitro and extends survival of mice with LuAd
With the exception of H358 cells, ERBB inhibition alone did not result 
in death of KRAS-mutant NSCLC cells in vitro; however, neratinib 
increased apoptosis induced by inhibition of MEK downstream of 
KRAS in multiple cell lines (Fig. 5A). Substitution of neratinib with 
a second multi-ERBB inhibitor, afatinib, replicated the effects of 
neratinib, confirming the on-target specificity of the drug (fig. S5A). 
Moreover, both drugs combined with MEK inhibition to suppress col-
ony formation (Fig. 5B). Consistent with published results (20), MEK 
inhibition alone increased expression of ERBB2 and ERBB3 in vitro, 
although the effect on ERBB2 phosphorylation was variable across the 
cell lines tested (Fig. 5C). Cotreatment with neratinib suppressed both 
expression and activity of ERBB2 and ERBB3 while also suppressing 
EGFR activity (Fig. 5C). Downstream of the RTKs, trametinib alone 
consistently suppressed expression of p-ERK and c-MYC, but in-
creased phosphorylation of AKT and STAT3 (Fig. 5C). Suppression of 
increased AKT phosphorylation by neratinib was clear only in H358 
cells, but the drug combination failed to reduce STAT3 phosphoryl-
ation. The growth inhibitory effects of the drug combination in vitro 
thus better correlate with suppression of the core RAS-ERK-MYC 
pathway than with the activity of ancillary signaling pathways.
The combination of MEK and multi-ERBB inhibition was pre-
viously shown to suppress the growth of subcutaneous NSCLC xe-
nografts under continuous daily treatment (20); however, cell line 
xenografts have a poor track record of accurately predicting human 
patient responses. We therefore tested the therapeutic efficacy of tran-
sient inhibition of ERBB and/or MEK in our fully immunocompetent 
KM model of autochthonous LuAd. Tumors were induced in adult 
KM mice and allowed to develop for 6 weeks. The presence of an IRFP 
Cre-reporter allele (33) in a subset of such animals allowed us to con-
firm the presence of tumors by LI-COR Pearl fluorescence imaging 
before initiating therapy (fig. S5B). Mice were treated daily for 1 week 
with neratinib, alone or in combination with trametinib, and then left 
untreated to determine the effect on overall survival. Transient ERBB 
blockade alone showed little influence on overall survival, whereas 
MEK inhibition alone extended survival of KM mice. The combina-
tion of neratinib and trametinib further extended survival over that 
achieved by MEK inhibition alone (Fig. 5D). Fluorescence imaging of 
IRFP-positive KM mice showed pronounced suppression of lung 
tumor growth in individual mice treated with combination therapy 
(fig. S5, B and C). Immunoblotting of tumors from mice treated for 
3 days with either drug alone or both combined confirmed the pathway- 
specific effects of these inhibitors in vivo (Fig. 5E). We conclude from 
these data that multi-ERBB inhibition may benefit LuAd patients 
with mutant KRAS-driven disease, if used in combination with other 
agents such as MEK inhibitors.
DISCUSSION
EGFR-selective inhibitors have failed to show clinical benefit in mu-
tant KRAS-driven cancers. In contrast with targeted inhibition of 
EGFR in isolation, we show here that broad inhibition of the ERBB 
network, using the multi-ERBB inhibitor neratinib, almost com-
pletely suppresses formation of KRASG12D-driven lung tumors and en-
hances the benefit of MEK inhibition in established tumors. We show 
that ERBB activity enhances signaling through the core RAS→ERK 
pathway, establishing a feed-forward loop that is associated with 
progression to invasion and metastasis. We also show that brief, tran-
sient inhibition of ERBB signaling enhances the therapeutic benefit 
of MEK inhibition in the autochthonous setting. Although this latter 
result is broadly supportive of the clinical implications of an earlier 
study showing that increased ERBB activity underlies resistance to 
MEK inhibition (20), our data are fundamentally distinct in that we 
demonstrate a clear role for ERBB activity from the very outset of 
KRAS-driven tumor initiation, as opposed to in reaction to targeted 
inhibition of MEK.
Mechanistically, we show that nascent KRasG12D-driven lung tu-
mors express multiple ERBB ligands and that production of these 
ligands increases markedly as tumors progress to more aggressive 
disease. In the cell culture setting, the release of these ligands drives 
autocrine signaling that supports the viability of cancer cells. In vivo, 
the release of such ligands into the extracellular milieu likely drives 
both autocrine and paracrine signal transduction in any local cell 
population that expresses ERBB RTKs. Hence, it is plausible to con-
sider that some of the tumor-suppressive benefit of neratinib may 
derive from inhibition of ERBB signaling in such stromal popula-
tions. Nevertheless, our cell culture analysis argues that the primary 
effect of ERBB inhibition is autonomous to the tumor epithelium. 
Further work will be needed to determine whether paracrine activa-
tion of ERBB RTKs on attendant stromal cell populations plays any 
role in tumor maintenance or progression.
Previous work has revealed that threshold levels of KRAS signal-
ing are required for tumor initiation and progression: In an inducible 
model of HRASG12V overexpression in mammary glands, focal tu-
mors arising spontaneously from nontransformed epithelium that 
expressed low amounts of the transgene exhibited a pronounced in-
crease in expression of the HRasG12V transgene and of multiple ERBB 
ligands, including Ereg, Tgf, and Hbegf, again suggestive of feed- 
forward signal amplification (25). More recently, this same “activity 
threshold” principle was shown to apply to ERK signaling as the key 
oncogenic effector pathway of KRAS in the lung (34). Through phar-
macological enhancement of ERK activity, this study showed that 
different airway cell types require distinct amounts of ERK signaling 
for oncogenic transformation by mutant KRAS, and that a second, 
higher, threshold signal was needed for progression to carcinoma. 
The existence of this higher threshold in KRAS-driven LuAd was al-
ready clear from the pronounced increase in ERK phosphorylation 
associated with tumor progression (25), which, in the KP model, is 
driven by spontaneous amplification of the G12D mutated allele (24). 
Our data suggest that ratcheting up ERBB signal transduction pro-
vides an alternative route to RAS pathway signal amplification, inde-
pendent of KRAS gene amplification. It is important to note that, 
from the human data, there does not appear to be a preferred mecha-
nism of ERBB signal enhancement—overexpression of ligands, am-
plification of RTKs, and/or accessory molecules could all plausibly 
achieve the same effect. What is clear from these data is that the po-
tential to increase ERBB signaling appears to be widespread in KRAS- 
mutant human LuAd.
Perhaps the most surprising observation is that endogenously 
expressed KRASG12D requires basal signaling from ERBB RTKs to

initiate lung tumors, even when accompanied by MYC overexpres-
sion. We previously showed that expression from the Rosa26 locus is 
refractory to growth factor signaling (35); thus, the requirement for 
ERBB activity does not reflect an artificial need for ERBB to sustain ex-
pression of the MYC transgene, whereas the observed effects on total 
MYC expression likely reflect the influence of RAS signaling on MYC 
protein stability (36). Instead, these data suggest that G12 mutant KRAS 
requires a push from upstream RTKs to breach the initial threshold 
needed for tumor initiation. Supporting this hypothesis, it was recently 
shown that G12 mutant KRAS, although no longer responsive to RAS-
GAPs [guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase)–activating proteins], does 
retain some level of intrinsic GTPase activity and thus cycles slowly 
between on and off states (4), opening the possibility for upstream sig-
naling to influence activity, either directly or by promoting activity of 
RAS guanonucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). Alternatively, tonic 
signal transduction through wild-type RAS isoforms may need to 
combine with that from mutant KRAS to likewise breach the thresh-
old for transformation (37). Our data presently do not distinguish be-
tween these possibilities, and they may not be mutually exclusive.
In the course of preparing this manuscript, we became aware of an 
independent study that strongly complements our observations and 
underscores our conclusions: The work by Moll and colleagues sim-
ilarly demonstrates a requirement for ERBB signaling to support pro-
gression of KRASG12D-driven lung cancer in vivo (38). Their study 
used an independent pan-ERBB inhibitor, afatinib, in the context of 
both KRASG12D-only and KRASG12D;p53Fl/Fl-driven tumor models. 
The strik 
ing similarities in the two studies attest to the on-target spec-
ificity of the two drugs used while also showing that the effects are 
independent of the genetic strategy used to accelerate KRAS-driven 
disease and are therefore likely to have broader potential application.
Activating mutations in KRAS are currently considered grounds 
for exclusion from clinical treatment with EGFR/ERBB inhibitors, and 
single-agent trials of the same drugs have only demonstrated efficacy 
in patient cohorts with activating mutations in EGFR or ERBB am-
plification (39). Our data concur that multi-ERBB inhibitors are un-
likely to benefit KRAS-driven cancer patients if used in isolation. 
However, we show here the potential for such drugs to sensitize au-
tochthonous KRAS-driven tumors to additional therapeutic agents, 
in this case to the MEK inhibitor trametinib. Our data argue that clin-
ical use of multi-ERBB inhibitors as part of an inhibitor cocktail to 
treat KRAS-driven LuAd deserves reexamination.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
Rationale for the project was to investigate the mechanistic basis of 
tumor progression in early-stage KRAS-driven lung cancer. Unbiased 
RNA-seq analysis identified increased expression of the ERBB net-
work, prompting further mechanistic investigation. All mice were 
asymptomatic at the date of treatment initiation and were allocated to 
treatment groups randomly. For survival benefit analysis, the absence 
of previous data precluded a precise power calculation: Sample sizes 
were therefore estimated according to Lehr’s quick formula at 80% 
power {n=16(c.v.)2(ln[r.m.])2}, assuming a ratio of the means of 0.2 
and a coefficient of variation of 0.3. For all other analyses, sample sizes 
were determined in accordance with the 3Rs. Animals were treated by 
facility staff without knowledge of anticipated outcomes. Humane end 
points were predefined as impaired breathing and/or hunching with 
10% or more weight loss. Histology, IHC, and ISH were performed 
blindly by the Beatson Institute histology core facility and were scored 
without reference to genotype or treatment group. Reporting is con-
sistent with the ARRIVE guidelines. In vitro experiments were all 
performed on three separate occasions, except where noted. In vitro 
analyses were not blinded.
Genetically engineered mice and mouse procedures
Procedures involving mice were performed in accordance with Home 
Office license numbers 60/4183 and 70/7950 [Cancer Research UK 
(CRUK), Beatson Institute for Cancer Research, UK]. LSL-KRasG12D 
(B6.129S4-Krastm4Tyj/J) mice (40) were obtained from the National Can-
cer Institute (NCI) mouse repository at Frederick, MD. Rosa26DM.lsl-MYC 
mice were generated as previously described (35) with the ATG-initiated 
human c-MYC (MYC2) complementary DNA (cDNA), devoid of 5′ and 
3′ untranslated regions, replacing the MYC–estrogen receptor ligand- 
binding domain fusion cDNA. Targeted insertion into the Rosa26 lo-
cus was confirmed by Southern blotting, and genotyping was initially 
performed with the following primers: (i) CCCAAAGTCGCTCT-
GAGTTG (common), (ii) GCGAAGAGTTTGTCCTCAACC (targeted 
locus), and (iii) GGAGCGGGAGAAATGGATATGA (wild-type 
locus). All genotyping was subsequently performed by TransnetYX 
Inc. Detailed in vivo procedures are provided in the Supplementary 
Materials along with IHC, laser-capture microdissection, and RNA-
seq methodology.
Cell culture and related assays
Human lung cancer cell lines (A549, H2009, and H358) were validated 
in-house and grown in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) 
and penicillin (100 U/ml)/streptomycin (100 g/ml). RAS-less MEFs 
reconstituted with wild-type or mutant KRAS isoforms were provided 
by the NCI RAS Initiative, Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer 
Research (Frederick, MD) and were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified 
Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% FBS and penicillin (100 U/ml)/
streptomycin (100 g/ml). For immunoblotting, cells were lysed in 
RIPAHi buffer [150 mM NaCl, 50 mM tris (pH 7.5), 1% NP-40, 0.5% so-
dium deoxycholic acid, 1% SDS plus Complete protease/phosphatase 
inhibitor cocktails (Sigma-Aldrich)] and, after Western blotting, probed 
with the following primary antibodies: p-ERK Thr202;Tyr204 (E-4) (SC-
7383, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), p-EGFR Tyr1068 (3777, Cell Signaling 
Technology), p-ERBB2 Tyr1248 (06-229, Millipore), p-ERBB3 Tyr1197 
(4561, Cell Signaling Technology), ERK1/2 (4695, Cell Signaling Tech-
nology), EGFR (06-847, Millipore), ERBB2 (OP15L, Merck), and ERBB3 
(05-390, Millipore). RAS:RAF binding assays were performed using 
a commercial RAS activity assay kit (Cytoskeleton) and probed with 
pan-RAS (AESA02, Cytoskeleton), KRAS (SC-30, Santa Cruz Bio-
technology), or HRAS-specific (18295-1-AP, Proteintech) antibodies 
(41). Cell propagation and death were analyzed by IncuCyte time-
lapse video microscopy in the presence of SYTOX Green. Cell death 
measurements were performed after 48 hours of drug treatment and 
corrected for confluence.
Statistical analysis
Raw data obtained from quantitative real-time polymerase chain re-
action, fluorescence-activated cell sorting, and IncuCyte assays were 
copied into Excel (Microsoft) or Prism (GraphPad) spreadsheets. All 
mean, SD, and SEM values of biological replicates were calculated using 
the calculator function. Graphical representation of such data was also 
produced in Excel or in Prism. Statistical significance for pairwise data 
was determined by Student’s t test. For multiple comparisons, ANOVA
