 Lay Summary 
 
Infant nutrition and maternal obesity prospectively influence the risk of 
nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in adolescents 
 
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a disorder in which there is 
excessive fat deposition in the liver that is commonly associated with obesity, in 
the absence of excessive alcohol intake. NAFLD is now the most common liver 
disorder in most populations and can occur at any stage from early childhood 
through to old age. Concerns regarding NAFLD arise from it becoming more 
commonly diagnosed, associated with increased risk of diabetes, obesity, 
cardiovascular disease, liver cirrhosis and liver cancer in some cases. 
 
There is currently no approved treatment for NAFLD, with lifestyle changes 
involving dietary care and exercise recommended. We have previously shown 
links between NAFLD and a Western dietary pattern, high fructose intake and 
trajectories of weight gain from early childhood. In this study we have examined 
whether there is an association between early infant feeding and maternal 
factors on NAFLD in well-characterised adolescents from the Western Australian 
Pregnancy (Raine) Cohort. 
 
We have shown that there is an increased risk of NAFLD in offspring of mothers 
who are obese at the start of pregnancy. Obesity in adolescents also increases the 
risk of NAFLD. However, breastfeeding without starting infant formula milk for 
the first 6 months of life reduces the risk of NAFLD, even after taking into 
account maternal and adolescent obesity and an unhealthy Western dietary 
pattern. Adolescents diagnosed with NAFLD but who were breastfed and with 
delayed initiation of formula milk for at least 6 months, were less obese and had 
less severe risk factors for cardiovascular disease and type II diabetes. 
 
Based on our findings we consider that reducing the risk of NAFLD needs to start 
before birth, aiming for a normal pre-pregnancy body mass index. Breastfeeding 
for at least 6 months and delaying formula milk feeding for that duration should 
be encouraged. Finally, child and adolescent obesity should be avoided.

Infant nutrition and maternal obesity influence the risk of nonalcoholic fatty liver 
disease in adolescents  
Abstract 
Background and aims 
The pathway to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in adolescents may have its origins 
in adiposity gains, nutrition and sedentary lifestyle established during childhood. There is 
inadequate knowledge regarding associations between infant nutrition and subsequent 
NAFLD. We examined the association of maternal factors and infant nutrition, with the 
subsequent diagnosis of NAFLD in adolescents. 
Methods 
 Adolescents aged 17 years in the Western Australian Pregnancy (Raine) Cohort study had 
fatty liver assessment using liver ultrasound. Prospectively recorded data on maternal 
pregnancy and infant feeding were examined against a NAFLD outcome during late 
adolescence. 
Results 
NAFLD was diagnosed in 15.2% of the 1170 adolescents examined. Ninety-four percent had 
been breastfed as infants. The duration of breastfeeding before starting supplementary milk 
was ≥4 months in 54.4% and ≥6 months in 40.6%. Breastfeeding without supplementary milk 
≥6 months (adjusted OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.43-0.94, p=0.02), maternal pre-pregnancy obesity 
(adjusted OR 2.29, 95% CI 1.21-4.32, P=0.01) and adolescent obesity (adjusted OR 9.08, 
95% CI 6.26-13.17, <0.001) were associated with NAFLD independent of a Western dietary 
pattern at age 17 years. Adolescents with NAFLD who had been breastfed for ≥6 months had 
a less adverse metabolic profile compared with adolescents breastfed for <6 months.

Supplementary milk intake starting before 6 months was associated with a higher prevalence 
and ultrasound severity of NAFLD compared with intake starting after 6 months (17.7% vs. 
11.2%, p=0.003 and 7.8% vs. 3.4%, p=0.005 respectively). 
Conclusion 
Though NAFLD is generally mediated through adiposity gains, breastfeeding for at least 6 
months, avoidance of early supplementary formula milk feeding, and normal maternal pre-
pregnancy BMI may reduce the odds of a NAFLD diagnosis during adolescence.   
 
Lay summary 
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common liver disorder in which there is too 
much fat in the liver in people who do not consume excessive amounts of alcohol.  
In this large study we found that infants who consumed breast milk for less than 6 months 
before starting infant formula milk, infants who were obese as teenagers or had mothers who 
were obese at the start of pregnancy, were much more likely to have NAFLD at age 17 years. 
Based on our findings we consider that reducing the risk of NAFLD in teenagers needs to 
start before birth, by encouraging normal body mass index before pregnancy, as well as 
breastfeeding without infant formula milk consumption for the first 6 months of life.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a complex disorder in which there is excessive 
fat deposition in the liver that is commonly associated with obesity and insulin resistance in 
the absence of excessive alcohol intake. NAFLD is now the most common liver disorder in 
humans (1), with a general population prevalence of 2.6% in children (2), 15.2% in 
adolescents (3) and 19-25% in adults (4-6). Population data from the National Health and 
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) in the USA showed a doubling of the prevalence 
of suspected NAFLD in adolescents over a 20 year period up to 2010 (7). Severe hepatic 
steatosis diagnosed using ultrasound has been shown to be independently associated with 
increased liver disease morbidity and mortality (8). Further, the histologic spectrum of 
NAFLD, comprising plain steatosis, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and NASH-
associated cirrhosis can occur from childhood through to adulthood (9). However, despite 
increasing evidence that adiposity gain during childhood and adolescence is a significant risk 
factor for NAFLD in adolescence (10,11) and in adulthood (12), the role of early life nutrition, 
including breastfeeding has not been adequately elucidated.  
Prior to 2001, the World Health Organisation (WHO) recommended that infants be 
exclusively breastfed for 4 to 6 months before introducing complementary foods, however, 
recommendations now suggest exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months of life (13). 
Benefits of breastfeeding extend beyond nutritional value to include potential reduction in 
rates of childhood infection, obesity and allergies later in life (14). There are, however, 
inconsistent reports about the influence of breastfeeding on later obesity (15), with some 
studies describing a possible protective effect on obesity (16,17) considered more likely with 
a threshold of 6 months of breastfeeding (18-21) and other studies unable to demonstrate this 
(22-24). The contradictions may reflect varied breastfeeding definitions (22), mixed feeding 
patterns including infant formula milk or complementary feeding, recall bias, maternal and 
individual factors including prevalent dietary habits and sedentary lifestyle. Maternal obesity

has been associated with shorter durations of breastfeeding, early introduction of 
supplementary formula milk and complementary food, possibly unhealthy food preferences in 
childhood and later obesity (25). There are, however, few studies examining whether 
maternal obesity, infant nutrition and early feeding habits prospectively influence the 
development of NAFLD. In particular, there is no current evidence that breastfeeding 
causally reduces NAFLD risk in humans. In the only published observational study 
examining the effect of breastfeeding on the development of NASH in humans, Nobili et al 
found longer duration of breastfeeding was associated with a reduction in the risk of NASH 
in children and adolescents (26).  
The aim of this study was to examine associations between duration of breastfeeding and age 
at introduction of complementary milk or solid food, maternal pre-pregnancy obesity and 
adolescent obesity, on the diagnosis of NAFLD in adolescents from the Western Australian 
Pregnancy Cohort (Raine Cohort) at 17 years of age. 
Materials and methods 
The Raine study is a longitudinal cohort study with prospectively collected maternal, birth, 
child and adolescent data, including detailed nutritional data in the early years of life and 
serial follow up every 2-3 years. The Raine Study was initiated as a pregnancy and birth 
cohort comprising 2,868 live-born children from 2,900 pregnancies recruited mainly from the 
antenatal clinics of King Edward Memorial Hospital for Women in Perth, Western Australia 
between 1989 and 1992. The background and serial assessments of the Raine cohort has been 
detailed previously (21). The following terms are explained: antenatal refers to the period 
during pregnancy, neonate refers to the newborn and infant is the child under 1 year. 
Antenatal data on mothers was prospectively collected, incorporating socio-demographic 
characteristics, history of gestational diabetes, hypertension during pregnancy, weight and

height and calculated body mass index (BMI). Neonatal data included mode of delivery, birth 
anthropometry, early feeding pattern and age when discharged home. Each subsequent child 
assessment involved detailed questionnaires on lifestyle, health, medications, and physical 
assessments including anthropometry and cardiovascular assessments. Lists of medications 
given to the infant, including antibiotics, were documented by the mother or care-giver at the 
1-year assessment. Aspects of infant nutrition examined were the duration of breast milk 
feeding, age at introduction of non-breast milk and solid feeding and types of milk consumed, 
as reported by the parents or primary caregiver of the child during the first 3 years of life. 
Mothers recorded the age at which breast-milk feeding stopped in a diary and this was 
clarified by direct interview during the ages 1,2 and 3-year surveys. Exclusive breastfeeding 
is defined as per the World Health Organisation as breastfeeding with no supplementary milk 
or complementary food intake (13). For the purpose of this study the terms breastfeeding and 
breast milk feeding are used interchangeably while consumption of supplementary milk or 
infant formula milk are considered the same. The age at which individuals stop breastfeeding 
and age of starting infant formula milk may have different metabolic effects. For example, in 
the Raine Study infants breastfed for >4 months but introduced to other milk at ≤4 months 
(mixed feeding) had the highest increase in BMI at age 14 years (17). Therefore, we 
considered the duration of breastfeeding and age at introduction of supplementary milk and 
complementary food separately, given the potential mixed patterns of feeding. Breastfeeding 
with supplementary milk intake and breastfeeding with no supplementary milk are used to 
describe feeding patterns regardless of any other complementary food intake.  
The 17-year cross-sectional assessment of the cohort was conducted between July 2006 and 
June 2009, at which time the participating cohort was representative of the broader Western 
Australian population (3). At age 17 liver ultrasound was performed to assess for fatty liver. 
Other data collected at the time were derived from detailed questionnaires, anthropometric,

clinical and biochemical measurements as previously described (3). Laboratory assessments 
were performed with venous blood samples taken from an antecubital vein after an overnight 
fast. Serum glucose, insulin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase 
(AST), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), triglycerides, total cholesterol, high-density 
lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), ferritin, 
transferrin saturation, high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), adiponectin, and leptin 
levels were assayed.  We did not test for hepatitis B or C virus infections because notification 
rates for hepatitis B and C virus infections were on average less than 24/100,000 and 
23/100,000, respectively, for Western Australian teenagers between the ages of 15 and 19 
years over the study period (3). Anthropometric measurements [weight, height, waist 
circumference, hip circumference, and skinfold thickness (SFT)] and cardiovascular 
assessments [resting pulse rate, systolic blood pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure 
(DBP)] were conducted by trained examiners. BMI was derived from weight (kg)/ height2 
(m2). Central obesity in the adolescents was defined by waist circumference ≥80 cm in 
females and ≥94 cm in males, consistent with age and gender-specific metabolic syndrome 
criteria of the International Diabetes Federation (27). We defined adolescent obesity by waist 
circumference since we previously identified a higher proportion of adolescents with central 
obesity using waist circumference than using BMI (3). The homeostasis model assessment for 
insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) score was calculated as follows: HOMA-IR score = [Fasting 
insulin (µU/ml) x Fasting glucose (mmol/L)]/ 22.5. 
Previously published reports describe the liver ultrasound methodology (3) and protocol (28). 
The diagnosis of hepatic steatosis (fatty liver) by ultrasound required a total fatty liver score 
of at least 2, including a liver echotexture score of at least 1. The ultrasound score was 
computed from liver echotexture (bright liver and hepato-renal echo contrast) 0-3, deep 
attenuation (diaphragm visibility) 0-2, and vessel blurring (intrahepatic vessel visibility) 0-1.

NAFLD steatosis severity was derived from the total fatty liver score as 0 to 1 (no fatty liver), 
2 to 3 (mild fatty liver), or 4 to 6 (moderate to severe fatty liver). We used an alcohol intake 
threshold of < 140 grams per week for females and < 210 grams per week in males, consistent 
with recent NAFLD diagnosis and management guidelines (29), to refine the ultrasound 
diagnosis of fatty liver to a clinical diagnosis of NAFLD. At 14 years of age, the adolescent, 
the parent or care-giver completed a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) 
developed by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) 
(30,31). From the FFQ data two dietary patterns, described as the Healthy pattern or Western 
pattern were defined and the extent of intake of these during the preceding 12 months was 
estimated. A z-score was assigned for each dietary pattern, indicating how closely the 
reported intake corresponded with the 2 patterns (31). We have previously described 
associations between dietary patterns and NAFLD in adolescents in the Raine cohort (31). 
Institutional ethics committee approval was obtained from the Princess Margaret Hospital for 
Children Human Research Ethics Committee. Signed informed parental consent and 
adolescent assent at 17 years were obtained. 
Statistical analysis 
Variables were summarized by the mean and standard deviation for symmetrical distributions 
and median and interquartile range (IQR) for asymmetric distributions. Differences in 
normally distributed data were analysed using Student’s t-test or Analysis Of Variance 
(ANOVA), while non-normally distributed data were analysed using the Mann-Whitney U 
test. Chi-square or Fisher’s exact test, as appropriate, were used to compare proportions. 
Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify predictors of NAFLD from 
maternal data, adolescent obesity, adolescent dietary patterns and infant feeding data. All 
statistical tests were two-sided and based on a significance level of 5%. Data were analyzed 
using IBM SPSS statistics for Windows (version 20.0; Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.). Because of

4 months or after 6 months. 
Results 
NAFLD in the Raine Cohort 
The cohort comprised 1170 community-based 17-year-old adolescents. Median alcohol intake 
was 10 grams per week (IQR 0-90 grams per week) during the preceding 12 months. 3 
adolescents were excluded from analysis due to excessive alcohol intake. Consequently, 
NAFLD was diagnosed in 177/1167 (15.2%), while 236/1156 (21.1%) with documented 
waist circumference had central obesity, comprising 32.7% female and 9.9% male (P < 
0.001). NAFLD was more prevalent in females than in males (19.6% vs 10.8%, P < 0.001), 
consistent with the female predominance of central obesity. However, amongst the centrally 
obese, 63/180 (35%) of females and 34/56 (60.7%) of males had NAFLD. Comparisons of 
adolescents in the cohort with or without NAFLD are shown in Table 1. 
Breastfeeding in the Raine Cohort 
The duration of breastfeeding was documented for 1153 study participants. The median 
(interquartile range [IQR]) duration of breastfeeding was 7.0 (2.0-12.0) months. There was no 
difference in the duration of breastfeeding between males and females (7[2-12] vs. 6[2-11], 
p=0.84 respectively). The duration of breastfeeding was ≥4 months in 66.5%, ≥6 months in 
56.3% and ≥12 months in 26.7%. True exclusive breastfeeding continued ≥4 months in 
42.9% and ≥6 months in 7.4%. Breastfeeding without supplementary formula milk occurred 
for ≥4 months in 54.4% and for ≥6 months in 40.6%. Further, breastfeeding for ≥6 months 
with supplementary milk introduced at ≥4 months was seen in 47.2%.

Maternal characteristics associated with the duration of exclusive breastfeeding 
After adjusting for maternal pre-pregnancy BMI, mothers who exclusively breast-fed their 
infant for <4 months compared with those who exclusively breastfed for ≥4 months tended to 
be younger, more likely to smoke during pregnancy, had lower family income and were less 
likely to be in a married or defacto relationship or to have completed secondary school 
education. A similar pattern was seen with early introduction of supplementary milk prior to 
4 months and 6 months in breastfeeding mothers (Table 2). By contrast, independent 
predictors of breastfeeding for ≥6 months were maternal age over 30 years (OR 2.35, 95% CI 
1.80-3.09, p<0.001), maternal non-smoking during pregnancy (OR 2.49, 95% CI 1.81-3.43, 
p<0.001), normal pre-pregnancy BMI (1.70, 95% CI 1.20-2.38, p=0.003) and annual family 
income >$36,000 at the time of delivery (OR 1.68, 95% CI 1.11-2.55, p=0.02). 
Influence of initial feeding at birth on infant feeding and adolescent NAFLD 
 Most neonates (94%) were breastfeeding on leaving hospital. Neonates who were discharged 
from hospital breastfeeding had a higher likelihood of breastfeeding at 6 months when 
compared with neonates discharged bottle-feeding (59% vs. 3%, p<0.001). There was a lower 
prevalence of adolescent NAFLD in neonates discharged home breastfeeding vs. bottle-
feeding (14.6% vs. 24.3%, p=0.03). However, there was no significant difference in the 
prevalence of NAFLD based merely on having ever been fed breast milk or not (14.5% vs. 
19.8%, p=0.12). Adolescents with NAFLD had a shorter duration of breastfeeding compared 
with adolescents without NAFLD (Table 1). 
Effect of breastfeeding for ≥ 4 months on the Prevalence of NAFLD 
Adolescents who had been exclusively fed breast milk for ≥4 months, compared with those 
with exclusive breastfeeding <4 months, had a lower prevalence of NAFLD (12.1% vs.

17.1%, p=0.02). Exclusive breastfeeding for ≥4 months was associated with reduced odds of 
NAFLD after adjusting for maternal obesity (OR 0.67, 95%CI 0.48-0.96, p=0.03) but did not 
remain significant when adolescent obesity was added into the model (OR 0.72, 95%CI 0.49-
1.07, p=0.10). Similarly, when breastfeeding for ≥4 months without supplementary formula 
milk but disregarding any solid food intake was considered, there were reduced odds of 
NAFLD after adjusting for maternal obesity (OR 0.70, 95%CI 0.50-0.98, p=0.04) but this did 
not remain significant when additionally adjusted for adolescent obesity (OR 0.72, 95%CI 
0.50-1.04, p=0.10). However, breastfeeding for ≥4 months without supplementary formula 
milk was associated with a lower prevalence of NAFLD compared with breastfeeding 
supplemented with formula milk intake <4 months (12.9% vs. 17.6%, p=0.03) 
Effect of breastfeeding for ≥ 6 months on the prevalence and severity of NAFLD  
Breastfeeding without supplementary milk for ≥6 months was independently associated with 
reduced odds of NAFLD in adolescence after adjusting for adolescent and maternal obesity 
(adjusted OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.43-0.94, p=0.02) and after adjusting for healthy and Western 
dietary patterns during adolescence (adjusted OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.41-0.87, p=0.008). 
Breastfeeding without supplementary milk for ≥6 months compared to <6 months, was 
associated with a lower prevalence of NAFLD even if complementary solid food was 
consumed prior to 6 months (11.1% vs. 17.9%, p=0.002). Non-exclusive breastfeeding ≥6 
months compared with <6 months was associated with a lower prevalence of NAFLD (12.6% 
vs. 18.3%, p=0.007). Breastfeeding without supplementary milk for ≥6 months, compared 
with <6 months, more than halved the prevalence of severe steatosis in adolescents with 
NAFLD (3.5% vs. 7.7%, p=0.005).

The prevalence of NAFLD was lower with longer durations of breastfeeding (Figure 1). 
There was a significant negative correlation between serum GGT in the adolescents and the 
duration of breastfeeding and age at introduction of supplementary milk (r= -0.08, p=0.01 and 
r= -0.09, p=0.006 respectively). There was no significant correlation between serum ALT and 
breastfeeding duration or age at starting supplementary milk (r= -0.03, p=0.70 and r= -0.04, 
p=0.31 respectively).   
Association of duration of breastfeeding on metabolic characteristics of adolescents with 
NAFLD. 
Adolescents with NAFLD who had been breastfed for ≥6 months had a less adverse 
metabolic profile compared with adolescents breastfed for <6 months. In particular, 
adolescents with NAFLD who were breastfed for ≥6 months had lower weight, BMI, waist 
circumference, subcutaneous fat, resting pulse rate, lower serum GGT, triglycerides, leptin, 
hs-CRP and HOMA-IR (Table 3). 
Effect of the age at introduction of supplementary formula milk on breastfeeding and 
NAFLD  
The median [IQR] duration of breastfeeding was shorter in infants introduced to formula milk 
<4 months compared with ≥4 months (2[0-4] months vs. 10[7-13] months, p<0.001. 
Adolescents with NAFLD had commenced supplementary formula milk intake at a 
significantly younger age than those without NAFLD (Table 1). The prevalence of NAFLD 
was lower the longer the delay in commencing supplementary milk (Figure 1). Formula milk 
intake earlier than 6 months was associated with a higher prevalence and severity of NAFLD 
than intake commenced after 6 months (17.7% vs. 11.2%, p=0.003 for NAFLD prevalence; 
7.8% vs. 3.4%, p=0.005 for severe steatosis). Infants commencing supplementary formula 
milk earlier than 6 months had an increased risk of a NAFLD diagnosis during adolescence

and Western dietary patterns during adolescence (adjusted OR 1.62, 95% CI 1.11-2.37, 
p=0.01). 
Effect of type of milk consumed at 1 year and age at introduction of solid food on 
Adolescent NAFLD  
Types of milk consumed by the infants at 1 year were breast milk-only 18.4%, infant formula 
milk-only 9.3%, cow milk-only 60.3%, soy milk 5.7% and unstated or other types or 
combinations of milk 6.3%. There was no difference in the proportion of infants subsequently 
diagnosed with NAFLD in association with the most common types of milk consumed at age 
1 year (breast milk 14.9%, formula milk 16.8%, cow milk 16.1%; p=0.30). Solid food feeding 
was introduced prior to 4 months in 18.6% and prior to 6 months in 79.0% of infants. The age 
at which solid food was commenced did not significantly contribute to the odds of being 
diagnosed with NAFLD during adolescence (OR 1.01, 95% CI 0.89-1.15, p=0.85), Figure 1.  
Association of infant antibiotic use with breastfeeding duration and NAFLD 
Data on antibiotic treatment during the first year of life was available for 1114 adolescents, 
amongst whom 16 had received antibiotics. Infants who had been treated with antibiotics had 
a shorter duration of breastfeeding compared with infants not treated with antibiotics (4.0 
[1.3-5.8] vs. 7.0 [3.0-12.0] months, p=0.02). However, there was no difference in antibiotic 
use during infancy in adolescents with NAFLD compared with adolescents without NAFLD 
(0.6% vs. 1.7% respectively, p=0.35) 
Prediction of adolescent NAFLD

determined from clinically or statistically plausible covariates, including the duration of 
breastfeeding without supplementary milk (<6 months vs ≥6 months) or age of introduction 
of formula milk, maternal pre-pregnancy obesity, maternal age, maternal smoking during 
pregnancy, adolescent obesity and dietary patterns during adolescence. Breastfeeding without 
supplementary milk ≥6 months reduced the risk, while maternal obesity and adolescent 
obesity increased the risk of a NAFLD diagnosis after adjusting for covariates (Table 5). In 
the whole cohort, neither a Western dietary pattern nor healthy dietary pattern at age 14 years 
was significantly associated with NAFLD at age 17 years (OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.80-1.21, 
p=0.89 and OR 1.06, 95% CI 0.86-1.29, p=0.61 respectively). By contrast, in obese 
adolescents a Western dietary pattern at age 14 years was associated with an increased risk of 
NAFLD (OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.05-2.00, p=0.03) while a healthy dietary pattern was associated 
with a non-significant reduced risk of NAFLD (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.54-1.07, p=0.12) in 
unadjusted analyses. However, the Western dietary pattern in obese adolescents was not 
associated with NAFLD after adjusting for duration of breastfeeding and maternal obesity 
(OR 1.251, 95% CI 0.877-1.786, p=0.217; OR 0.527, 95% CI 0.289-0.998, p=0.049, OR 
3.651, 95% CI 1.426-9.351, p=0.007 respectively). 
Discussion 
In this study we report an inverse association between the duration of infant breastfeeding as 
well as the age at introduction of supplementary formula milk on the subsequent diagnosis of 
NAFLD in adolescence. This observation is independent of the adverse effect of maternal 
pre-pregnancy BMI and adolescent obesity. In unadjusted analysis, breastfeeding for ≥6 
months reduced the odds of a later diagnosis of NAFLD in adolescence by over 40% 
compared with shorter durations of breastfeeding. Breastfeeding without supplementary milk 
for ≥6 months was also associated with a lower prevalence of severe steatosis. By contrast, 
early introduction of supplementary milk feeding before 6 months increased the odds of

NAFLD by at least 70%. Breastfeeding for at least 6 months without starting supplementary 
milk until after 6 months reduced the odds of a NAFLD diagnosis by nearly 40% after 
adjusting for maternal obesity and obesity during adolescence. The age at which 
complementary solid food was introduced was not associated with NAFLD. 
A previous human study showed a reduced prevalence and severity of NAFLD/ NASH with 
longer durations of breastfeeding, in a drug-like cumulative dosing manner (26). We have 
now extended that observation with a finding that a longer duration of breastfeeding and later 
initiation of supplementary formula milk are associated with a reduced prevalence of NAFLD 
and of severe steatosis. In particular, there was a potentially protective effect of 6 or more 
months of breastfeeding on the expression of metabolic characteristics of adolescents with 
NAFLD. Amongst adolescents with NAFLD, those breastfed for at least 6 months had a more 
favorable metabolic profile compared with those breastfed for shorter durations. It is 
therefore plausible that breastfeeding for 6 or more months results in a longer-term 
favourable metabolic milieu in NAFLD that may protect against NASH. 
The role of the duration of breastfeeding and of maternal obesity on later development of 
NAFLD in humans remains poorly detailed. Evidence from a mouse model suggests that 
maternal obesity during pregnancy, plus a post-natal obesogenic diet, program offspring to 
develop NAFLD (32,33). Animal models have additionally demonstrated that maternal pre-
pregnancy and pregnancy-associated obesity, foetal and early postnatal exposure to high fat 
nutrition increase programming for increased hepatic lipogenesis, lipid oxidation and hepatic 
steatosis in rats (34). Despite the relationship of maternal obesity and smoking with NAFLD, 
we did not find an association between maternal hypertension or diabetes during pregnancy 
and NAFLD.  The putative mechanism of breast milk protection against dysmetabolism, 
including NAFLD, is uncertain and may not involve nutritional value alone but also 
attenuation of the adverse metabolic programming resulting from maternal and child obesity

and effects on the gut microbiome. There is evidence that breast milk (35,36) and early 
antibiotic use (37) influence the gut microbiota in infants. Additionally, recent evidence 
shows that different gut microbiota patterns may reflect progression of NAFLD to NASH in 
children and adolescents (38). While breast milk contains hormones that regulate adiposity, 
contributes to the composition of the intestinal microbiota and possibly influences future food 
preferences (39), early antibiotic use during breastfeeding was recently shown to negatively 
influence the benefits of longer breastfeeding duration on longer-term metabolic health (40). 
We found antibiotic use in infants associated with a shorter duration of breastfeeding, but did 
not associate with the adolescent NAFLD outcome. 
There is large variability in the composition of breast milk that is dependent on maternal 
factors such as breast milk fatty acid, triglyceride, leptin and insulin secretion, maternal 
obesity, maternal diet composition and genetic influences that could result in programming 
for obesity and NAFLD in offspring (25,32). Breast milk quality is also influenced by 
gestational age at delivery and lactation duration, and differs from formula milk in nutrient 
composition and presence of growth factors, cytokines, immunoglobulins, and digestive 
enzymes (41). High-protein formula milk is associated with higher weight gain than lower 
protein formula milk though both types of formula milk produce more weight gain than breast 
milk (42). Formula milk may also produce higher insulin secretion and high hepatic glucose 
output affecting hepatic lipogenesis (43) that contributes to the development of NAFLD.  
Higher maternal pre-pregnancy BMI has been associated with reduced breastfeeding duration 
(44). We have now shown that early breast milk feeding after hospital delivery increases the 
likelihood of breastfeeding for ≥6 months, which is associated with reduced odds of a 
NAFLD diagnosis. Pre-pregnancy maternal obesity, short duration of breastfeeding, early 
formula milk feeding and subsequent child and adolescent obesity all contribute to NAFLD. 
NAFLD severity, in turn has been linked with liver-related morbidity and mortality (8). It is

therefore critical that the multiple opportunities to address these risk factors be identified and 
steps be implemented to (a) reduce obesity in women of child-bearing age, (b) encourage 
breastfeeding for the first 6 months of life, (c) discourage supplementary formula milk intake 
during the first 6 months of life, (d) reduce child and adolescent obesity. This would require 
multidisciplinary efforts by primary care physicians, obstetricians, midwives, pediatricians, 
community child nurses and other clinicians.  
Limitations of our study include that (a) it is an observational study and cannot conclude 
causality, (b) use of ultrasound and not histology or MRI for diagnosing fatty liver, (c) 
reliance on parent recall for the record of infant nutrition, (d) possible underestimate of the 
role of maternal BMI which is also associated with duration of breast feeding and (e) since 
only 40% of the original cohort participated in the liver ultrasound assessment 
generalizability to the whole cohort or general community cannot be guaranteed. However, 
use of ultrasound to diagnose fatty liver is supported by both the American Association for 
the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD) and European Association for the Study of the Liver 
(EASL) guidelines that recommend liver ultrasound and not liver biopsy as the preferred 
first-line diagnostic test for screening patients for fatty liver (29,45). While liver histology is 
the gold standard to distinguish plain steatosis from NASH, liver biopsy increases study cost, 
is invasive, has a small complication risk and could not be justifiable in the large community-
based cohort of asymptomatic adolescents participating in this non-interventional 
observational study. Consequently, we used a validated liver ultrasound protocol with high 
sensitivity and specificity for fatty liver (28) and did not rely on serum transaminase levels, 
which are often “normal” in NAFLD, as in this population (3). Since severe hepatic steatosis 
on ultrasound has been shown to be independently associated with increased liver disease 
morbidity and mortality, liver ultrasound may be a useful prognostic tool (8). Also, maternal 
recall of breastfeeding duration is considered to be a valid and reliable estimate of

breastfeeding initiation and duration when the detail is recalled after a period up to 3 years 
(46), as in this study. In this respect we are encouraged by the observation that maternal 
factors influencing breastfeeding and breastfeeding rates that we described are similar to 
those in a later Australian national survey (47). 
In conclusion, though NAFLD is generally mediated through adiposity gains, breastfeeding 
for at least 6 months, avoidance of early supplementary formula milk feeding and attaining 
normal maternal pre-pregnancy BMI are recommended to reduce the odds of a NAFLD 
diagnosis during adolescence.  Further research is required to better define the relative 
contributions of genetic, maternal, dietary and physical activity factors on the development of 
NAFLD.

*Graphical Abstract
 Highlights 
 
 Maternal pre-pregnancy obesity is associated with NAFLD in adolescent 
offspring. 
 Breastfeeding initiated at birth and continued for 6 months or longer, before 
commencing infant formula milk consumption, reduces the odds of NAFLD in 
adolescence. 
 Mothers should be supported and encouraged to breastfeed infants for at 
least 6 months. 
 Despite associations of maternal pre-pregnancy obesity, breastfeeding 
duration and timing of starting infant formula milk intake, obesity in the 
individual remains a major contributor to NAFLD in adolescents.
