Abstract
Objective
To investigate whether greater cardiovascular fitness in midlife is associated with decreased
dementia risk in women followed up for 44 years.
Methods
A population-based sample of 1,462 women 38 to 60 years of age was examined in 1968. Of
these, a systematic subsample comprising 191 women completed a stepwise-increased maximal
ergometer cycling test to evaluate cardiovascular fitness. Subsequent examinations of dementia
incidence were done in 1974, 1980, 1992, 2000, 2005, and 2009. Dementia was diagnosed
according to DSM-III-R criteria on the basis of information from neuropsychiatric examina-
tions, informant interviews, hospital records, and registry data up to 2012. Cox regressions were
performed with adjustment for socioeconomic, lifestyle, and medical confounders.
Results
Compared with medium fitness, the adjusted hazard ratio for all-cause dementia during the
44-year follow-up was 0.12 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.03–0.54) among those with high
fitness and 1.41 (95% CI 0.72–2.79) among those with low fitness. High fitness delayed age at
dementia onset by 9.5 years and time to dementia onset by 5 years compared to medium fitness.
Conclusions
Among Swedish women, a high cardiovascular fitness in midlife was associated with a decreased
risk of subsequent dementia. Promotion of a high cardiovascular fitness may be included in
strategies to mitigate or prevent dementia. Findings are not causal, and future research needs to
focus on whether improved fitness could have positive effects on dementia risk and when during
the life course a high cardiovascular fitness is most important.

 Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of observational studies
constantly link physical activity to preserved cognitive func-
tioning and decreased risk for dementia.1–3 These studies are
limited by reliance on self-reported physical activity and not
objectively assessed fitness. Thus, it remains unclear whether
the association between physical activity and dementia is
mediated by social and cognitive stimulation rather than by
level of physical fitness. Furthermore, most studies are con-
ducted in people >60 years of age at baseline, and few have
a follow-up of >20 years (mean follow-up 3–7 years), making
causal inferences difficult.4–6
Aerobic exercise programs aiming at improving cardiovascular
fitness seem to have moderate effects on cognitive function
among healthy older person.5,7 However, current data from
randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are insufficient to show
that these improvements are due to improved cardiovascular
fitness.5
Presently, no RCTs and very few long-term prospective
studies have been able to relate fitness to dementia incidence.
The US Cooper Center Longitudinal Study recently reported
that a high midlife fitness, assessed by a maximal treadmill test,
was associated with lower risk of developing dementia over
a mean follow-up period of 24 years.8 Furthermore, 1 large
register study among men in Sweden reported that low car-
diovascular fitness, assessed with a bicycle ergometer test at 18
years of age, was associated with an increased risk of early-
onset (<60 years) dementia.9 This is interesting because the
etiology of early-onset dementia is supposed to have strong
genetic components. Finally, 1 population study from Finland
found that poor self-rated fitness in mid to late life was as-
sociated with increased dementia risk over 25 years of follow-
up.10 Thus, there is a need for studies that examine objective
fitness before old age with follow-up of dementia until very
old age.
Midlife has been suggested as a “sensitive period” for the effect
of cardiovascular risk factors on dementia.11,12 We therefore
tracked dementia incidence for a period of 44 years among
women enrolled in the Prospective Population Study of
Women (PPSW) who performed a test of maximal cardio-
vascular fitness in midlife.
Methods
The study is part of the PPSW, which was initiated in 1968.13
Women born in 1908, 1914, 1918, 1922, and 1930 were
systematically sampled from the Swedish Population Register
on the basis of specific birth dates. Among those sampled,
1,462 women were examined (participation rate 90%). The
details and procedures for the examination of the original
sample have been described elsewhere.13 A systematic sub-
sample (born on the sixth day of uneven months, e.g., January,
March, etc) were admitted to an exercise test, and 191 took
part (response rate 81%): 29 who were 38 years, 41 who were
46 years, 37 who were 50 years, 47 who were 54 years, and 37
who were 60 years of age.14 Follow-ups for dementia di-
agnoses were performed in 1974 to 1975 (n = 174, 8 had died,
9 refused), 1980 to 1981 (n = 147, 20 had died, 24 refused),
1992 to 1993 (n = 99, 57 had died, 35 refused), 2000 to 2001
(n = 68, 92 had died, 31 refused), 2005 to 2006 (n = 46, 118
had died, 27 refused), and 2009 to 2010 (n = 13, 151 had died,
27 refused). Cases of dementia were also identified via the
Swedish Hospital Discharge Register until December 2012.
Participants in the exercise test did not differ from the total
sample in age or in cumulative dementia incidence (23.0% vs
22.1%, p = 0.780).
Standard protocol approvals, registrations,
and patient consents
The Ethics Committee of the University of Gothenburg ap-
proved the study. All women gave informed consent to par-
ticipate in accordance with the provisions of the Declaration
of Helsinki.
Work capacity
Cardiovascular fitness was tested at baseline in 1968 by
a stepwise-increased ergometer cycling test until exhaustion
that was supervised by a physician. Details on the full pro-
cedure and exclusion criteria have been described pre-
viously.14 Briefly, after initial submaximal tests of 6 minutes on
200 kilopond m/min (32 W) and 400 kilopond m/min (64
W), the test was interrupted for 5 minutes before the women
were brought to maximal workload. The level of maximal
workload was chosen on basis of the results from the pre-
ceding submaximal test with the aim of achieving an ap-
proximate working time of 6 minutes before voluntary fatigue.
If the person had not reached her limit of exhaustion, the
workload was increased by an additional 50 to 100 kilopond
m/min toward the end of the test. During the period of
maximal work, heart rate and ECG were registered every
minute, blood pressure was registered after 1 and 2 minutes,
and respiratory frequency and perceived exertion according to
the Borg-scale15 were noted after 3 minutes and then every
minute. The maximal exercise test aimed at arriving at maxi-
mal subjective exhaustion as indicated by the Borg scale15;
altogether, 93% perceived their maximal load as strenuous
(scale point ≥15) and half of the participants as very, very
strenuous (scale point 19–20).14 The term peak workload is

 used here because no objective criteria were used for reaching
the maximal workload, corresponding to maximal oxygen
uptake.
Among 20 women, the test was interrupted during the sub-
maximal test because of changes in ECG (n = 6), too high
blood pressure (n = 3), claudication (n = 2), chest pain (n =
1), insufficient cooperation (n = 2), or other reasons (n =
6).14 For analytic purposes, these women were categorized as
having low fitness. The main results did not change when
these persons were excluded.
Neuropsychiatric examinations and
dementia diagnosis
The neuropsychiatric examinations were performed by psy-
chiatrists in 1968 to 1969, 1974 to 1975, 1980 to 1981, and
1992 to 1993 and by experienced psychiatric research nurses
in 2000 to 2003, 2005 to 2006, and 2009 to 2010. The
examinations were semistructured and included psychiatric
interviews, observations of mental symptoms, neuropsychi-
atric tests, and close informant interviews.16
The diagnosis of dementia was based on information from
psychiatric examinations, close informant interviews, medical
records, and the Swedish Hospital Discharge Registry, as
described in detail previously.16 For participants in the neu-
ropsychiatric examinations, dementia diagnoses were made by
geriatric psychiatrists after reviewing information from both
neuropsychiatric examinations and the close informant in-
terview. The diagnosis was made if the participant had
dementia according to both sources of information or if
there was clear evidence of dementia from 1 source and
subthreshold symptoms in the other.
For individuals lost to follow-up, dementia diagnoses were
based on information from medical records evaluated by ge-
riatric psychiatrists in consensus conferences and from the
Swedish Hospital Discharge Register. The latter provided
diagnostic information until December 2012 for all individ-
uals discharged from hospitals on a nationwide basis since
1978.17 We have previously reported that the Hospital Dis-
charge Register detects 44% of persons diagnosed at the
examinations.18
See supplemental data on dementia diagnosis in appendix e-1
(links.lww.com/WNL/A330).
Confounders
Potential covariates were chosen on the basis of previous
research4 and biologically relevant variables at the baseline
examination in 1968. Education was dichotomized as
compulsory (6 years for those born in 1908–1922, 7 years
for those born in 1930) or more than compulsory. Smoking
was classified as current/ex-smoker vs never smoker.
Physical activity during leisure and occupation was assessed
according to a slightly modified version of the 4-level Saltin-
Grimby scale.19,20 Level 1 (almost completely inactive) was
classified as physical inactivity. Wine consumption was di-
chotomized as never drinker or drinker. Hypertension was
defined as systolic blood pressure ≥140 mm Hg, diastolic
blood pressure ≥90 mm Hg, and/or taking antihypertensive
medication. Body height was measured to the nearest cen-
timeter and weight to the nearest 0.1 kg. Body mass index
was calculated as kilograms per meter squared. Serum
cholesterol and triglyceride levels were assessed after an
overnight fast. Diabetes mellitus was self-reported and de-
fined as diagnosis told by a physician or being on antidia-
betic
therapy
(insulin
and/or
tablets).
History
of
myocardial infarction and angina pectoris was self-reported
and defined as a diagnosis told by a physician. The diagnosis
of stroke was based on information from participants and
key informants, the Swedish Hospital Discharge Registry,
and hospital medical records.
Statistics
Incidence proportions of dementia are presented as cumula-
tive incidence. Differences between fitness groups were ana-
lyzed with the χ2 test for dichotomous variables and 1-way
analysis of variance for continuous variables. We calculated
Cox proportional hazards models with all-cause dementia as
the outcome and fitness as the predictor. Person-years were
calculated from date of baseline examination to (1) time of
dementia onset, (2) date of death according to the Swedish
Population Register, or (3) December 31, 2012, for all other
participants.
For analytic purposes, fitness was described as follows: the
crude peak workload categorized into quintiles, but because
the 3 middle groups had very similar incidence of dementia,
analyses were performed with peak workload categorized into
low (≤80 W or interrupted at submaximal workload), medium
(88–112 W), and high (≥120 W) fitness; and peak workload/
body weight transformed into stanine scores and categorized
as low (stanine score 1–3 or interrupted at submaximal
workload), medium (stanine score 4–6), and high (stanine
score 7–9) fitness.
In model 1, we included age and body height as confounders.
In model 2, further confounders were included if bivariate
associations in logistic regressions had values of p < 0.20 with
all-cause dementia (i.e., serum triglycerides p < 0.001, smoker
p = 0.18) or with fitness (i.e., hypertension p < 0.001, wine
consumption p = 0.008, physical inactivity p = 0.161, income
p = 0.010).
All analyses were done with IBM SPSS Statistics 22 (IBM,
Armonk, NY). Tests were 2 sided, and the level of significance
was set to p < 0.05.
Results
The mean peak workload at the ergometer cycling test in 1968
was 103 (SD 21) W. The midlife characteristics of the study

 population are presented in table 1. Women with high fitness
more often had their own income and higher wine con-
sumption and less often had hypertension compared to those
with medium or low fitness. Mean age at death was 80.4 years,
and 15% were still alive at the end of the study. We found no
statistical difference between the groups in age at death or
survival.
In total, 44 women (23.0%) developed dementia during 5,544
person-years of follow-up from 1968 to 2012. The mean
follow-up period was 29 years. Diagnoses included 20 cases of
pure Alzheimer dementia, 8 of vascular dementia, 12 of mixed
dementia, and 4 of other dementias. Altogether, 28 cases of
dementia were diagnosed on the basis of information from the
examinations, and another 16 (36%) were diagnosed from
registers and case records. The mean time to dementia onset
from midlife examination was 29.0 years, and the mean age at
dementia onset was 80.5 years.
Table 2 shows the relation between peak workload and cu-
mulative dementia incidence. It is noteworthy that the de-
mentia incidence among those who interrupted the test at
submaximal workload was 45%.
When categorized into 3 fitness groups based on the peak
workload, the cumulative incidence of all-cause dementia was
32% for low, 25% for medium, and 5% for high fitness. Similar
results were seen for peak workload/body weight (table 3).
The mean time to dementia onset was 5 years longer for those
with high compared to those with medium peak workload.
The mean age at dementia onset was 11 years higher among
those with high peak workload compared to those with me-
dium peak workload (table 3).
Compared to medium peak workload, the adjusted hazard
ratio for all-cause dementia was 0.12 (95% confidence interval

 [CI] 0.03–0.54) among those with high peak workload and
1.41 (0.72–2.79) among those with low workload (table 4).
Compared to medium peak workload/body weight, the ad-
justed hazard ratio for all-cause dementia was 0.35 (95% CI
0.13–0.97) for those with high fitness and 1.37 (95% CI
0.62–3.02) for those with low fitness.
To minimize the influence of incipient dementia on associa-
tions between fitness and dementia, we reanalyzed the data
excluding those with dementia onset before 70 years of age
and dementia onset before the years 1992 and 2000. This did
not change the associations (data not shown).
Discussion
We found that high cardiovascular fitness in midlife was as-
sociated with decreased risk of dementia in a population of
women followed up for up to 44 years. High compared to
medium fitness decreased the risk of dementia by 88%.
The most pronounced risk reduction was seen among par-
ticipants with the highest fitness. The 3 previous longitudinal
studies on fitness and dementia reported a dose-response
relation. The US study, which assessed fitness with a maximal
treadmill test, found a decreased dementia risk for every fit-
ness quintile. Similar to our study, the lowest risk was seen
among those with highest fitness.8 On the other hand, the
large register study on Swedish men, which assessed fitness
according to a bicycle ergometer test at 18 years of age, found
an increased risk of early-onset dementia (<60 years) for
those with medium fitness compared to those with high fit-
ness and further increased risk for those with low fitness.9 The
Finnish study, which used a single question of self-rated
fitness, found primarily an increased dementia risk among
those with poor fitness.10 A possible dose-response relation
between fitness and dementia risk needs to be further
investigated.
We found a very high dementia incidence among those for
whom the bicycle test had to be interrupted at submaximal
workload. This indicates that adverse cardiovascular processes
might be going on in midlife that seem to increase the risk for
dementia.

 The risk reduction of high fitness on dementia was stronger
for the crude peak workload than for peak workload/body
weight. This is similar to studies on all-cause mortality in
which obese fit individuals have a mortality risk similar to
that of normal-weight fit individuals.21 This highlights the
need for fitness-driven, rather than weight loss–driven,
approaches.
Fitness and physical activity are related but not identical.22
The hazard ratio in our study was stronger than those
reported for physical activity.2,23 This is also reported in re-
lation to cardiovascular disease,22 indicating that cardiovas-
cular fitness is a more valid measure or that high fitness per se
is a stronger protective factor than physical activity. It needs to
be emphasized that fitness has a strong genetic component.24
Genotype may also modify the association between fitness
and dementia. However, evidence is mixed regarding the
modifying effect of the APOE e4 allele, the main genetic risk
factor for dementia.1,10 We had data on genes for only a sub-
sample and cannot draw any conclusions about the impact of
APOE e4 on the relation between fitness and dementia.
Certain time periods across the life course might be especially
important for the effect of cardiovascular fitness. Factors early
in life might increase brain reserve, which moderates the ex-
pression of brain damage and age-related changes.25 Several
dementia-prevention RCTs are on the way, all of which target
older persons. One is the multidomain Finnish Geriatric In-
tervention Study to Prevent Cognitive Impairment and Dis-
ability (FINGER) study, which targets older persons with
cardiovascular risk factors.26 This study reported promising
results on cognition after 2 years. Another study targeted
sedentary older persons and included moderate-intensity
aerobic (walking) and strength training,27 but it found no
effect on cognition after 2 years. Recently, a 6-year multido-
main intervention reported no effects on dementia in-
cidence.28 Future intervention studies are needed that target
whether the actual improvement in cardiovascular fitness
(and muscle strength) is the pathway between physical ac-
tivity and cognitive functioning.7 In practice, it will take a very
long time to have RCTs that examine the effect of improved
midlife (or childhood) fitness on dementia. Meanwhile,
longitudinal observational studies such as ours can provide
information.
Several mechanisms might be involved in how fitness reduces
dementia risk. These include both indirect effects such as
influence on hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, obesity,
and diabetes mellitus and directs effects on the brain, with, for
example, enhancement of neuronal structures, neurotrans-
mitter synthesis, and growth factors.1,29 Our study and the 3
other longitudinal studies on fitness and dementia8–10 show
similar results in unadjusted analyses and analyses adjusted for
indirect effects. This indicates that direct effects on the brain
need to be further investigated. In line with this, a recent study
found that lower cardiovascular fitness was associated with
smaller brain volume 2 decades later.30 The brain regions that
seem most influenced by physical activity are those that are
also vulnerable to age-related changes and early pathologic
changes in Alzheimer disease such as the hippocampus.31
Further research on long-term direct effects of fitness on brain
structure is needed to improve strategies for dementia
prevention.
Major strengths of our study are the objective assessment of
fitness, the fact that baseline examinations were carried out in
midlife, the 44 years of follow-up, that the dementia diagnosis
was made by neuropsychiatrist according to extensive
examinations, the population-based sample, and the extensive
collection of potential confounders. However, there are sev-
eral limitations. First, this study had an observational design;
therefore, we cannot draw conclusions on cause and effect.
Second, the sample was relatively small, leading to a lack of
statistical power and limiting the possibility for subanalyses.
Third, the study includes a relatively homogeneous sample of
Swedish women. We thus cannot generalize to other pop-
ulations. In addition, women in the study probably received
more medical care than other women because persons in
whom we identified pathologic conditions (e.g., hyperten-
sion) were referred for medical treatment. Fourth, cumulative
dropout is a problem in long-term follow-up studies. While
this problem was, to some extent, alleviated by the use of
hospital registry data for those lost to follow-up, this probably
results in an underestimation of the number of dementia
cases. It should be noted that almost all people in Sweden
receive hospital treatment within the public health system,
and the Swedish Hospital Discharge Register covers the entire
country. Fifth, the exercise test in 1968 measured work ca-
pacity, not maximal oxygen consumption with expired gas

 analysis, the gold standard for cardiorespiratory fitness. Sixth,
the maximal workload for the women in our study is lower
compared to previously reported reference values.32 This
might be due to different procedures for the exercise test.
Seventh, we did not have data on changes in fitness across the
life course. Eighth, competing risk may influence the results of
a study with long-follow-up because both dementia and low
fitness may increase the risk for death. This might result in an
underestimation of the association between these conditions.
The use of risk-years in the Cox regression analyses partly
takes care of competing risk because persons who die earlier
will contribute fewer years.
Our findings indicate that high cardiovascular fitness in
midlife is associated with decreased risk of dementia. Im-
proved cardiovascular fitness in midlife might be a modifiable
factor to delay or prevent dementia. Findings are not causal,
and future research needs to focus on whether improved fit-
ness could have positive effects on dementia risk and when
during the life course a high cardiovascular fitness is most
important.

Study question
Does increased cardiovascular fitness during midlife reduce
the risk of dementia in adult women, and how far into the
lifespan does this protection extend?
Summary answer
Among Swedish women aged 38–60 years, high cardiovas-
cular fitness levels reduced dementia risks—incidence, age at
onset, and time to onset—over a 44-year period.
What is known and what this paper adds
Previous analyses of self-reported data show a strong link
between physical activity and decreased risk for dementia
within 20 years of testing. This longitudinal study objectively
measured cardiovascular fitness and the risk of dementia in
women during their midlife stage.
Participants and setting
The study comprised 191 participants from the Swedish
Population Register based on birth dates who underwent
exercise testing.
Design, size, and duration
Participants were assigned to low-, medium-, or high-baseline
cardiovascular fitness levels, as determined by peak workload
results in ergometer cycling tests to exhaustion. Peak work-
load was defined as work capacity, measured using physiologic
markers and perceived exertion. Dementia assessments were
performed periodically during 1968–2012 (mean = 29 years).
Dementia was diagnosed using neuropsychiatric examina-
tions, close informant interviews, and evaluations of medical
records, and from the Swedish Hospital Discharge Register.
Main results and the role of chance
High cardiovascular fitness levels during midlife decreased the
risk of dementia. Compared to the medium fitness group, the
high fitness group showed an 88% decrease in dementia in-
cidence, 5 years longer to onset, and 11 years higher mean age
at onset. The highest fitness levels presented with the lowest
dementia risk, suggesting a dose-response association. Hazard
ratios for fitness are higher than those reported for physical
activity, indicating fitness is a more valid measure and pro-
vides greater protection.
Bias, confounding, and other reasons
for caution
An observational study cannot identify cause-and-effect rela-
tionships. The relatively small sample size restricted statistical
power and sub-analyses. Participants received more medical
monitoring and care than the general population. Long-term
data collection may result in underestimated findings due to
cumulative drop-outs and competing mortality risks. Fitness
levels are strongly influenced by genetic factors. Work ca-
pacity is a less accurate measure of fitness than O2 con-
sumption. There is also a need to confirm that fitness is the
mechanism connecting physical activity and cognitive func-
tion. Potential confounders include education, smoking,
leisure/work activity, wine consumption, hypertension, body
height/weight, BMI, serum cholesterol/triglycerides, diabetes
mellitus, myocardial infarction/angina pectoris, stroke.
Generalizability to other populations
The study used a relatively homogenous group of Swedish
women, which limits generalization to other populations.

The study was funded by a group of university, government and
foundation grants. Go to Neurology.org/N for full disclosures.
