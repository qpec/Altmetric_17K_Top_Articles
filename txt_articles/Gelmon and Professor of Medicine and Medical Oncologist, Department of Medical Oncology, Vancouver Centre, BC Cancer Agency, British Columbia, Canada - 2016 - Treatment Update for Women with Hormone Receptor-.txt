ew treatments are needed urgently for advanced cancer of the breast, in which the most common subtype is hormone receptor-
positive breast cancer. In the randomised, double-blind, multicentre phase III trial, Fulvestrant and AnastrozoLe COmpared in 
hormonal therapy Naïve advanced breast cancer (FALCON), a statistically significant 21% reduction in the risk of disease progression 
or death was reported in women with hormone receptor-positive advanced breast cancer who had been treated with fulvestrant compared 
with those who had received anastrozole. Women in this study had not received prior hormone therapy. Access to the treatment and the 
mechanisms for funding need to be facilitated in a timely fashion. Ongoing studies are awaited to help define the optimal sequence of 
therapy for women with hormone receptor-positive advanced breast cancer.

Endocrine treatment constitutes the therapeutic backbone for hormone receptor-positive breast 
cancer,1 the most common breast cancer subtype.2 Despite its efficacy, endocrine resistance can 
arise3 and alternative treatments options are a pressing requirement. Recently, in the double-blind, 
multicentre, phase III trial, Fulvestrant and AnastrozoLe COmpared in hormonal therapy Naïve 
advanced breast cancer (FALCON), the selective oestrogen receptor degrader, fulvestrant, was 
shown to significantly increase progression-free survival (PFS) in women with hormone receptor-
positive advanced breast cancer when compared with anastrozole treatment.4 Median PFS was 
16.6 months in the fulvestrant-treated group (n=230) versus 13.8 months for the anastrozole 
group (n=232) (p=0.048). Subgroup analysis showed an even greater impact on PFS among 
fulvestrant-treated patients whose disease had not spread to the liver or lungs at baseline, 
indicating that fulvestrant would be a particularly good advantageous option for patients with 
non-visceral disease. For patients with visceral disease, the data would suggest that outcomes 
were comparable for patients treated with fulvestrant versus patients who received anastrozole. 
In the FALCON study, women who were hormone therapy naïve were randomised to receive either 
two 250 mg intramuscular injections of fulvestrant (Days 0, 14, 28, then every 28 days) or 1 mg 
of anastrozole, and were also allowed one line of chemotherapy. The clinical implications of the 
findings from FALCON are discussed by Dr Karen Gelmon from the BC Cancer Agency in British 
Columbia, Canada, along with other broader issues in breast cancer care.

Q:  
How do the FALCON data help in terms 
of patient selection to inform treatment 
decisions in clinical practice?
Like all data, the FALCON results are difficult to interpret without an 
in-depth assessment of the full published paper. The FALCON data 
are however promising, particularly given the tolerability of the drug. 
 
As well, in patients with non-visceral disease who have not been 
previously treated, fulvestrant looks like a good therapeutic option. 
 
A more detailed breakdown of the outcomes in visceral disease is 
needed; however, for example sub-analysis by lung or liver as both are 
included in the visceral category.
Q:  
What are the implications of the FALCON data 
in daily clinical practice given that the study 
included only endocrine-naïve patients?
The FALCON study involved a group of patients not usually seen in daily 
clinical practice that is those who had not been previously treated. The 
implications are that the drug will be used in patients who have had prior 
therapy as these patients are more common and the outcomes for this 
group are not yet known. As well, the availability of the new data hasn’t 
yet led to access to fulvestrant treatment for many patients. In addition, 
for maximum benefit in daily clinical practice, it would be preferable 
if fulvestrant were available in a more patient-friendly formulation. 
Fulvestrant should be administered as two consecutive 5 ml injections 
by slow intramuscular injection (1–2 minutes per injection), one in each 
buttock. Certain patients will find this process difficult and painful and 
this may impact on its use.
Q:  
How may the optimal first-line therapy for 
women with advanced breast cancer be 
defined in view of this development?
Single-agent aromatase inhibitors as first-line therapy no longer seem 
appropriate for many patients although we need further information 
on the optimal sequence of treatments.  We also need data on the 
outcomes for single agent fulvestrant in the second- and third-line setting 
particularly after treatment with CDK4/6 inhibitors as well as data on the 
use of CDK4/6 inhibitors after fulvestrant. It is also crucial to know if any 
of the new trials will lead to an improvement in overall survival; survival 
data will be available in the future for FALCON, the PALOMA-2 (A Study of 
Palbociclib (PD-0332991) + Letrozole vs. Letrozole For 1st Line Treatment 
Of Postmenopausal Women With ER+/HER2- Advanced Breast Cancer)
trials and MONALLESA-2 (Study of Efficacy and Safety of LEE011 in 
Postmenopausal Women With Advanced Breast Cancer) trials. When we 
have those data, the best sequencing of treatments may become clearer, 
as if there is a major survival advantage with one of the treatments, it will 
become the preferred standard.
Q:  
How may evidence be obtained that throw 
light on whether adherence to guidelines 
affects treatment outcomes in patients with 
advanced breast cancer?
Real world data can be obtained by looking at geographic regions 
where guidelines have been implemented. It is vital that the guidelines 
should be up-to-date and should reflect best practice. Even so, it is 
not straightforward to demonstrate improved patient outcomes with 
guideline adherence. First, there is a lag between when the guidelines 
are introduced and the treatment practices are taken up and, second, 
there is further delay before improvement on patient outcomes can 
be detected. 
While guidelines and guideline adherence are important, the processes 
allowing access to treatment also need to be conducted within a timely 
manner. Funding mechanisms also need to be tackled proactively to 
provide access to treatments. 
Q:  
What advances with regards to predictive 
biomarkers can we expect to see in the 
foreseeable future?
The major predictive biomarker in the short term will be the use of 
circulating tumour DNA detected in plasma in breast cancer which will be 
used to identify actionable genomic alterations and treatment responses. 
In the future, predictive markers should be available to identify treatment 
resistance early in the course of a treatment.
Q:  
How can physician education enhance how 
sensitive and responsive clinicians are to the 
individual needs and expectations of each 
patient?
Many oncologists are sensitive to patient individuality though this 
can be advanced through ongoing physician education, for example, 
via webinars, journals and lectures. It depends on what mandatory 
Continuing Medical Education requirements are in place whether you 
would reach all relevant audiences. Emphasis on patient-centred care 
and the individual tolerance and response to treatments is important. q
