Oncolytic Viruses in Cancer Treatment
A Review
Sean E. Lawler, PhD; Maria-Carmela Speranza, PhD; Choi-Fong Cho, PhD; E. Antonio Chiocca, MD, PhD
O
ncolytic viruses (OVs) comprise a diverse group of bio-
logic agents with potential as cancer therapeutics.
Numerous clinical trials are under way or have been
completed using this approach. In 2015, in a milestone for the
field, talimogene laherparepvec became the first OV to gain US
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in the United
States.1 However, the use of viruses for cancer treatment is not
new. Throughout the 20th century, case studies and small trials of
various viruses in cancer therapy were reported.2 These investiga-
tions conducted with small numbers of patients used wild-type
and often crudely prepared viral isolates, and it was not until the
1990s that the era of genetic engineering of viruses to enhance
their oncolytic potential began. The first reported3 genetically
engineered OV was based on herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1).
This development was rapidly followed by many studies2 illustrat-
ing the effectiveness of this approach using a diverse range of
viruses and tumor models. The main focus of the field during the
early development of OVs was to identify viruses or their engi-
neered variants with tumor-selective replication. However, it has
always been appreciated that an immune component is important
and may be critical for the therapeutic efficacy of this approach.
Indeed, OVs are now broadly considered as immunotherapy
agents for which effectiveness in patients depends on activation
of host antitumor immune responses.4-6
Early clinical trials7-9 of OVs showed encouraging safety pro-
files,evenathighdoses,withsomepromisingresponses,evidence
ofintratumoralviralreplication,andimmunecellinfiltrates.Thefield
is now gaining traction after the report of significant benefits in a
large randomized phase 3 clinical trial of the engineered immunos-
timulatory OV talimogene laherparepvec in patients with ad-
vanced melanoma10-12 and its subsequent approval in the United
States and European Union. Many OVs are now under investiga-
tion in advanced trials, with some encouraging data.13 Thus, after 2
decades of clinical trials in humans with cancer, OVs are emerging
as therapeutic agents in oncology. This review summarizes recent
progress in this area and describes ongoing clinical trials.
IMPORTANCE Oncolytic viruses (OVs) are emerging as important agents in cancer treatment.
Oncolytic viruses offer the attractive therapeutic combination of tumor-specific cell lysis
together with immune stimulation, therefore acting as potential in situ tumor vaccines.
Moreover, OVs can be engineered for optimization of tumor selectivity and enhanced
immune stimulation and can be readily combined with other agents. The effectiveness of OVs
has been demonstrated in many preclinical studies and recently in humans, with US Food and
Drug Administration approval of the oncolytic herpesvirus talimogene laherparepvec in
advanced melanoma, a major breakthrough for the field. Thus, the OV approach to cancer
therapy is becoming more interesting for scientists, clinicians, and the public. The main
purpose of this review is to give a basic overview of OVs in clinical development and provide a
description of the current status of clinical trials.
OBSERVATIONS In 2016 approximately 40 clinical trials are recruiting patients, using a range
of OVs in multiple cancer types. There are also many more trials in the planning stages.
Therefore, we are now in the most active period of clinical OV studies in the history of the
field. There are several OVs currently being tested with many additional engineered
derivatives. In OV clinical trials, there are a number of specific areas that should be
considered, including viral pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, potential toxic effects,
and monitoring of the patients’immune status. Clinical development of OVs is increasingly
focused on their immune stimulatory properties, which may work synergistically with
immune checkpoint inhibitors and other strategies in the treatment of human cancer.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Oncolytic viruses are an active area of clinical research. The
ability of these agents to harness antitumor immunity appears to be key for their success.
Combinatorial studies with immune checkpoint blockade have started and the results are
awaited with great interest.

Mechanisms of OV Action
A general mechanistic understanding of OV action is emerging in
which therapeutic efficacy is achieved by a combination of selec-
tive tumor cell killing and establishment of antitumor immunity
(Figure).Immunestimulationiscausedbyreleaseofcelldebrisand
viral antigens in the tumor microenvironment. Tumor selectivity in
OV therapy is driven by several factors. The first of these is cellular
entry via virus-specific, receptor-mediated mechanisms. A specific
viral entry receptor is often highly expressed on tumor cells. How-

OVs as Cancer Therapeutics
General Properties
A wide range of viruses with diverse properties are under investi-
gationclinically(eTable1intheSupplement).Oncolyticvirusesrange
insizeandcomplexityfromlarge,double-strandedDNAvirusessuch
as vaccinia (190 kilobase [kb])17 and HSV1 (152 kb)18 to the tiny par-
vovirus H1 (5-kb linear, single-stranded DNA).19 Oncolytic viruses
cause cell lysis by various means during their life cycle, with the ex-
ception of retrovirus, which can be rendered lytic by toxic trans-
gene expression.20
There are a few wild-type viruses in clinical use. These include
reovirus, a human virus with low pathogenicity21,22; coxsackievi-
rus, which is structurally related to polio virus and causes several
symptoms in humans23,24; and viruses with nonhuman hosts, in-
cludingNewcastlediseasevirus(avian),25parvovirusH1(rat),19and
vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) (insects, horses, cows, and pigs).26

Oncolytic vaccinia and measles are derived from vaccine strains.27
There are documented cases28 of wild-type measles viruses infec-
tions and tumor regression. Most measles OVs are based on the at-
tenuated Edmonston measles vaccine strain (MVEdm), which has
an excellent safety record after decades of use in humans.29

has oncolytic selectivity to cells with activation of ras signaling.15 In
the case of adenovirus, replication occurs in S phase, and the wild-
type virus encodes a protein (E1A) that functions via retinoblastoma
signaling to promote S-phase entry.33,34 Because cancer cells typi-

Clinical Application
A diverse range of viruses has been investigated as potential can-
cer therapeutics. The individual characteristics of OVs currently in
clinical trials are summarized below and outlined in Table 1.

tients with melanoma (16.3%) compared with controls (2.1%). Ef-
fects were most pronounced in patients with stage IIIB, IIIC, IVM1a,
or treatment-naive disease.10,11 Tumor regression was seen in dis-
tant noninjected lesions, suggesting the establishment of systemic
antitumor immunity. Talimogene laherparepvec is derived from a
clinical HSV1 strain (JS1) deleted for ICP34.5 and ICP47, which nor-

bone, which may allow improved replication in patients compared
with other oHSVs built on a laboratory HSV1 strain background.
Adenovirus
OncolyticadenovirusesweresomeoftheearliestOVstoenterclini-
cal trials. The history of adenovirus as an oncolytic agent has been
wellreviewed.57AnE1A/E1B-deletedvirus(ONYX015)hasbeenex-
tensively tested and approved for treatment of head and neck can-
cer in China under the name H101.58 An integrin-binding retar-
getedadenovirus,Δ24RGD(DNX2401),hasbeenexaminedinclinical
trials42,59 in which the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was not
reached and some responses were observed. Trials are also under

Vaccinia Virus
At the present time, JX-594 (Pexa-Vec) is being tested in multiple
tumor types.47,48,60 Pexa-Vec is based on the Wyeth vaccinia vac-
cine strain engineered to express human GM-CSF and has been
tested in more than 300 patients. It is well tolerated and increased
survival in patients with liver cancer after intravenous injection.48
Prostvac, a prime-boost regimen targeting prostate-specific anti-
gen in prostate cancer, uses engineered vaccinia as a primary im-
munotherapy, followed by boosters using fowlpox virus. Both vec-
tors express prostate-specific antigen and a panel of costimulatory
molecules:ICAM-1(intercellularadhesionmolecule1),B7.1,andLFA3.
Subcutaneous injection of Prostvac initiates an antitumor immune
response, is well tolerated, and significantly increased overall sur-
vivalinphase2trials.49Thisdualvirusapproachovercomestherapid
appearance of neutralizing antibodies against vaccinia. A phase 1
dose-escalation trial of Prostvac in combination with ipilimumab
showed no additional toxic effects and some promising responses
(MTD was not reached).61
Measles Virus
Measles causes fusogenic syncytia formation and cell death.62 A
measles virus expressing the human sodium/iodide symporter
SLC5A5 (MV-NIS) is currently in a range of clinical trials63; MV-NIS
allows imaging of infected cells and monitoring of treatment pro-
gression as well as radiovirotherapy with I 131–labeled sodium io-
dide.Clinicaldatahaveconfirmedsafetyanddemonstratedimaging
of virus infection and tumor regression with this approach.46

and are built on favorable 2015 phase 2 data in stage IIIC and stage
IV melanoma. One study65 reported a preliminary DRR of 21% with
regression of distant noninjected lesions.

Retrovirus
Retroviruses are potentially useful agents because they readily in-
fect mitotic cells and rapidly spread, although without necessarily
causing cell lysis.20 Toca511 is based on murine leukemia virus en-
gineered to express the yeast enzyme cytosine deaminase, which
converts 5-fluorocytosine to the toxic metabolite 5-fluorouracil. In
studies53,54 of mice with implanted gliomas, Toca511 therapy re-
sulted in long-term survival and systemic antitumor immunity me-
diated by memory T cells. Toca511 is currently in a phase 2/3 clinical

examined in clinical trials alone and in combinations in a range of
cancers.70 Reolysin was given orphan drug status for the treat-
ment of malignant glioma by the FDA in 2015.
Parvovirus H1
Parvovirus H1 causes tumor-selective cell killing that is thought to
result from a combination of toxic effects of the viral gene product
NS1 as well as lytic viral replication.19 A trial of wild-type parvovirus
H1(ParvOryx)inrecurrentglioblastomahasbeencompletedandthis
agent is currently in trials for metastatic pancreatic cancer.
Vesicular Stomatitis Virus
Vesicular stomatitis virus selectivity is dependent on deficient in-
terferon signaling.26,71 An engineered VSV variant overexpressing

thatinterferonβmayactsynergisticallywithVSVbyprotectingnor-
mal cells from infection and causing tumor cell–specific destruc-
tion and antitumor immune responses.
Newcastle Disease Virus
Wild-type Newcastle disease virus has oncolytic effects in a variety
of tumor types through syncytia formation and apoptosis.25 Early
clinical trials showed promise and safety72; however, to our knowl-
edge, no trials involving this virus are presently recruiting patients.
Considerations for OV Clinical Trials
With the emergence of increasing numbers of OVs and combinato-
rialstudiesintheclinicaltrialarena,itisworthconsideringissuesin-
volved in clinical trial design and execution. Areas evolving as the
field develops are delivery, viral pharmacokinetics and pharmaco-
dynamics, and biomarkers.
Safety
Although mortality has been reported occasionally, published trial
data have not shown significant general safety issues. However, as
OVs with greater potency are developed and used in novel combi-
nations,safetyremainsaconcern.Despiteengineeringfortumorcell
specificity, there is the possibility of off-target effects, and genetic
manipulation may result in unexpected toxic effects. Other con-
cerns include virus mutation, evolution, and recombination; cyto-
toxic gene products; and viral transmissibility. Oncolytic HSVs have
retained their native thymidine kinase gene, which facilitates virus
replicationandisalsothetargetoftheantiviraldrugganciclovir.The
retentionofthymidinekinaseallowsthepossibilityofcontrollingin-
fectionandisseenasanimportantadvantageintermsofsafety.Po-
tentialsafetyconcernsarereflectedinclinicaltrialcriteria,whichdo
not allow inclusion of immunocompromised patients or those with
active viral infections.
Toxic and Adverse Effects
Local delivery of OVs is generally well tolerated. The most common
adverse effects reported are mild flulike symptoms, which may be
moresevereaftersystemicadministration,andlocalreactionatthe
injection site. These reactions can be reduced by acetaminophen
administration before treatment.73
Dose
In contrast to results in conventional drug clinical trials, many OVs
do not reach an MTD owing to the concentration of virus stock that
ispossibletoachieveorveryhightoleranceforthevirus.Maximum
tolerated dose may need to be re-established for trials using novel
therapeutic combinations.
Viral Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics,
and Biomarkers
Effectiveness of OV therapy is monitored by standard approaches,
including imaging and tumor-specific biomarkers. In addition, viral
pharmacokineticsandpharmacodynamics(shedding,viremia,rep-
lication,genomes,andviralload)arefrequentlyincludedinOVtrials.
These approaches allow inpatient tracking of viral fate in patients.
Additional viral pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic variables
include analysis of intratumoral viral replication and immune infil-
trates by immunohistochemistry and circulating immune cell sta-
tus. In multi-institutional trials, it may be optimal to use centralized
testing to ensure reproducibility.
Resistance Mechanisms
One of the most fascinating features of OV therapy is the battle be-
tween the virus and the host, which is vital in determining the thera-
peuticoutcome.ThemajorresistancemechanismsinOVtherapyre-
sultfromtotheabilityofthehosttorapidlyshutdownviralreplication.
Host antiviral mechanisms include the presence of neutralizing anti-

ity of the virus to replicate and spread within tumors. The existence

myeloid cells into the tumor microenvironment. Conversely, vascu-
lar endothelial growth factor sensitizes tumor vasculature to
vaccinia and VSV via a novel mechanism.78
Delivery
Therapeutic delivery of OVs is dependent on virus and tumor type.
Most often, OVs are injected directly into the tumor site. For ex-
ample, tumors of the brain are treated using local delivery by mul-
tiple injections at a single time point (during surgery). Other, more
accessible tumors can be treated with multiple doses and multiple
injection sites over time. The experience with talimogene laherpar-
epvec provides an indication that OV administration at a single tu-
mor site can lead to regression of distant tumors, implying that the
inductionoflocalantitumorimmunitycanhavesystemiceffects.In-
travenous injection is also commonly used and allows systemic ad-
ministration to multiple tumor sites. Cellular carriers may also be
used, which may protect the virus from recognition by the host
immune system before reaching the tumor.79
Ongoing OV Trials
Asearchofclinicaltrials.govperformedApril1,2016,listedapproxi-
mately 40 clinical trials currently recruiting patients for treatment
with OVs (summarized in Table 2; full list in eTable 2 in the Supple-
ment).Thereisrepresentationfrommultiplecountriesacross4con-
tinents,withmosttrialsbeingconductedintheUnitedStates.These
trials have been almost exclusively performed in adults, with stud-
iesinyoungadultsandpediatricpatientsjustbeginning.73Mosttrials
areearly-phase,dose-finding,andexploratorystudies,althoughin-
creasingnumbersoflate-phasetrialsareanticipated.Trialsincreas-
ingly incorporate viral pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics,
and a consistent feature is monitoring of the immune response to
virus and tumor. Few viruses in the present trials express human
transgenes.Basedonencouragingpreclinicaldata,numerouscom-
bination studies are under way using small molecules and chemo-
therapy.Asdescribedbelow,mosttrialsinvolvecombinationtherapy
with immune checkpoint blockade.
Immune Therapy OV Combinations
Recently, cancer immunotherapies have gathered an unprec-
edented level of interest owing to newly FDA-approved immuno-
logic treatments based on targeting immune checkpoint inhibition
pathways that can relieve T-cell exhaustion in the tumor
microenvironment.80,81 Ligands that activate checkpoint path-
waysandcauseT-cellexhaustionareoftenexpressedbytumorcells

and nivolumab (anti-PD1) have an 11.5-month median survival
compared with 2.5 months for ipilimumab alone.
There is presently a clear opportunity to investigate the im-
pact of combining immunostimulatory OVs with immune check-
pointblockadeincancers,effectivelyacceleratingtheantitumorim-
mune response while removing the barriers that may otherwise
impair T-cell–mediated tumor killing. Indeed, talimogene laherpar-
epvec is now in a clinical trial in combination with ipilimumab. Cur-
rently, pembrolizumab (anti-PD1) and ipilimumab are being tested
in combination with talimogene laherparepvec, Cavatak, and Reo-
lysin (eTable 2 in the Supplement). These combinations may allow
greater response rates in immune-sensitive tumors, such as mela-
noma, and may render checkpoint inhibitor–resistant tumors more
sensitivetotreatment.Thenumberofpotentialcombinationsofim-
munetherapiesisenormous,andanimportantquestioniswhether
preclinical studies can accurately predict which of these combina-
tionswillbethemostefficaciousinhumans.84Overall,furtherwork
isrequiredtoevaluatethepossibledirecteffectsofeachtypeofOV
on immune checkpoint mechanisms and determine the best
combinations for future trials.
ThecreationofnovelOVsexpressingcheckpointinhibitoryan-
tibody molecules is under way in many laboratories. This develop-
ment would allow in situ expression, avoiding adverse effects from
systemicdeliveryoftheantibody,andincreasethelocalimmunere-
sponse against the tumor cells. An engineered oncolytic adenovi-
rus Delta-24,RGDOX (DNAtrix Inc) has been shown85 to enhance
antitumor immune responses through expression of OX40L, an
immune checkpoint costimulatory ligand.
Other OVs in Development
Many laboratories are developing improved OVs at the preclinical
level. In addition to immune stimulation, efforts are being made to
improveviruspotencyandtumortargeting.Forexample,inthepast
few years, seed sequences of differentially expressed microRNAs
havebeenincorporatedintoOVstoincreasetumorcellselectivity.86
Thisstrategycanbeadaptedtodifferentvirusesandmayprovidea
safer and more efficient way to increase virus efficacy by reducing
collateral damage to healthy cells. At present, one clinical trial on
adenovirusAd5PTD(CgA-E1AmiR122)45usesmiR-122tocontrolE1A
expression to ensure tumor selective replication.
It is also recognized that improved tumor cell lysis may be nec-
essary for therapeutic efficacy. It is thought that this improvement
can serve the dual role of shrinking tumors and provoking greater
antitumorimmuneresponsesviareleaseoftumorantigensanddan-
ger signals. A wide range of next-generation OVs are in preclinical
development with improved lytic properties. For example,
rQNestin34.5wasdevelopedforuseinbraintumorsinwhichICP34.5
expression (deleted in other oHSVs) is restored under transcrip-
tional control of the nestin promoter to drive expression selec-
tively in glioma stem cells.87 Other combinations have also been
reported,88 including histone deacetylase inhibition, which
promotes oncolytic herpesvirus replication in animal models.
