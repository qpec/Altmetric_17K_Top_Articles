Abstract
BACKGROUND—Currently, the diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 
requires a ratio of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) to forced vital capacity (FVC) of 
less than 0.70 as assessed by spirometry after bronchodilator use. However, many smokers who do 
not meet this definition have respiratory symptoms.
METHODS—We conducted an observational study involving 2736 current or former smokers and 
controls who had never smoked and measured their respiratory symptoms using the COPD 
Assessment Test (CAT; scores range from 0 to 40, with higher scores indicating greater severity of

 symptoms). We examined whether current or former smokers who had preserved pulmonary 
function as assessed by spirometry (FEV1:FVC ≥0.70 and an FVC above the lower limit of the 
normal range after bronchodilator use) and had symptoms (CAT score, ≥10) had a higher risk of 
respiratory exacerbations than current or former smokers with preserved pulmonary function who 
were asymptomatic (CAT score, <10) and whether those with symptoms had different findings 
from the asymptomatic group with respect to the 6-minute walk distance, lung function, or high-
resolution computed tomographic (HRCT) scan of the chest.
RESULTS—Respiratory symptoms were present in 50% of current or former smokers with 
preserved pulmonary function. The mean (±SD) rate of respiratory exacerbations among 
symptomatic current or former smokers was significantly higher than the rates among 
asymptomatic current or former smokers and among controls who never smoked (0.27± 0.67 vs. 
0.08±0.31 and 0.03±0.21 events, respectively, per year; P<0.001 for both comparisons). 
Symptomatic current or former smokers, regardless of history of asthma, also had greater 
limitation of activity, slightly lower FEV1, FVC, and inspiratory capacity, and greater airway-wall 
thickening without emphysema according to HRCT than did asymptomatic current or former 
smokers. Among symptomatic current or former smokers, 42% used bronchodilators and 23% 
used inhaled glucocorticoids.
CONCLUSIONS—Although they do not meet the current criteria for COPD, symptomatic 
current or former smokers with preserved pulmonary function have exacerbations, activity 
limitation, and evidence of airway disease. They currently use a range of respiratory medications 
without any evidence base. (Funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and the 
Foundation for the National Institutes of Health; SPIROMICS ClinicalTrials.gov number, 
NCT01969344.)
Among the criteria that are needed to make a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (COPD) are deficits in the rate at which one can forcefully exhale. Most experts 
consider a low ratio (<0.70) of the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) to the 
forced vital capacity (FVC) after bronchodilator use to be a key diagnostic criterion.1 Once 
the diagnosis of COPD has been established, the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive 
Lung Disease (GOLD) nomenclature grades severity according to the degree to which the 
measured FEV1 is lower than the patient's predicted value. GOLD stage 1, indicating mild 
disease, is defined as an FEV1 that is greater than or equal to 80% of the predicted value; 
GOLD stage 2, indicating moderate disease, as an FEV1 that is greater than or equal to 50% 
and less than 80% of the predicted value; GOLD stage 3, indicating severe disease, as an 
FEV1 that is greater than or equal to 30% and less than 50% of the predicted value; and 
GOLD stage 4, indicating very severe disease, as an FEV1 that is less than 30% of the 
predicted value.
However, some smokers who do not have airflow obstruction — those whose FEV1:FVC 
after bronchodilator use is equal to or greater than the conventionally accepted cutoff of 0.70 
— nonetheless report cough, sputum production, and shortness of breath; these symptoms 
are suggestive of COPD.1-3 Furthermore, the FEV1:FVC ratio can be insensitive to early 
airway disease.4 A recent task-force document emphasized the need for additional research 
involving smokers with symptoms and normal lung function.5

 In the Subpopulations and Intermediate Outcome Measures in COPD Study (SPIROMICS), 
we hypothesized that many current or former smokers who have respiratory symptoms 
despite an FEV1:FVC of at least 0.70 after bronchodilator use have clinical symptoms and 
findings that are consistent with a chronic lower respiratory disease similar to COPD. To test 
this hypothesis, we focused on current or former smokers who had respiratory symptoms at 
baseline despite preserved pulmonary function as assessed by spirometry (FEV1:FVC ≥0.70 
and an FVC above the lower limit of the normal range after bronchodilator use). We required 
an FVC above the lower limit of the normal range in order to minimize the misclassification 
of participants with restrictive disease as having COPD. We then determined whether these 
symptomatic current or former smokers with preserved pulmonary function had a higher risk 
of respiratory exacerbations or abnormalities on a high-resolution computed tomographic 
(HRCT) scan of the chest or shorter 6-minute walk distances than asymptomatic current or 
former smokers with preserved pulmonary function.
Methods
Participants and Study Design
In this multicenter observational study funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood 
Institute,6 we enrolled 2736 participants from 2010 through 2015. The study included 
persons 40 to 80 years of age who were either healthy persons who had never smoked (≤1 
pack-year of tobacco-smoking history, FEV1:FVC ≥0.70 before bronchodilator use, an FVC 
that was equal to or above the lower limit of the predicted normal range,7 and no known 
current lung disease or unstable cardiovascular disease) or current or former smokers who 
had a smoking history of more than 20 pack-years, regardless of whether they had a clinical 
diagnosis of obstructive lung disease.
For this study, we categorized participants for analysis using the GOLD staging system 
according to the results on spirometry,8 which we performed before and after four 
inhalations each of albuterol at a dose of 90 μg per inhalation and ipratropium at a dose of 18 
μg per inhalation. Current or former smokers who had a concomitant diagnosis of asthma 
were not excluded; instead, historical data on whether the participant had a diagnosis of 
asthma were collected. We quantified symptoms during a stable phase of disease (>6 weeks 
after any exacerbation) using the COPD Assessment Test (CAT), a validated eight-question 
health-status instrument.9 CAT scores range from 0 to 40, with higher scores indicating 
greater severity of symptoms. In the context of COPD, GOLD uses a CAT score of 10 or 
more as a threshold for more severe symptoms in consideration of treatment regimens.8
We obtained an exacerbation history prospectively (every 3 months) with the use of a 
structured questionnaire, and we defined exacerbations on the basis of the use of antibiotic 
agents, systemic glucocorticoids, or a combination of both or a health care utilization event 
(office visit, hospital admission, or emergency department visit for a respiratory flare-up). 
We defined severe exacerbations as interactions that led to hospitalization or an emergency 
department visit. Exacerbations were managed by the participants’ usual providers, who 
were aware of their patient's enrollment in an observational study. The study did not, 
however, provide guidance on management. Spirometric tracings were independently 
reviewed.

 All the participants underwent testing to determine the distance walked in 6 minutes.10 From 
computed tomographic scans of the lung, we measured the extent of emphysema and 
airway-wall thickness with the use of HRCT imaging and VIDA Diagnostics software. A 
threshold of −950 Hounsfield units was used to define emphysema; Pi10, defined as the 
square root of the wall area of a theoretical circular cross section of an airway that is 10 mm 
in the lumenal perimeter, was used to define airway-wall thickening.11
This study was not population-based, so we recruited participants from the population at 
each center by means of physician referral, advertisement in clinical areas, or self-referral at 
the study website (www.spiromics.com). The research protocol was approved by the 
institutional review board at each participating institution, and all the participants provided 
written informed consent.
Statistical Analysis
The investigators performed the data analysis using SAS software, version 9.3 (SAS 
Institute). We used one-way analysis of variance, the chi-square test, and the Kruskal–Wallis 
test, as appropriate, for the comparisons of groups. P values are two-sided, with Bonferroni-
corrected pairwise comparisons between individual groups (with adjustment for the 10 
comparisons that result from comparisons across five groups). A P value of less than 0.05 
was considered to indicate statistical significance.
To control for potential confounders, we used linear regression (for the 6-minute walk 
distance and lung function) and logistic-regression models (for the bronchodilator response). 
We fit proportional-means models for recurrent events of exacerbations to accommodate 
differences in follow-up time across participants.12 We defined annualized exacerbation 
rates as the total number of events per person, divided by the number of follow-up days for 
that person, multiplied by 365.
In additional analyses, we stratified the analysis according to smoking status (current or 
former), participant's report of previous diagnosis of COPD by a health provider (yes or no), 
and asthma (never, during childhood, or ever). We developed receiver-operating-
characteristic curves to determine the value of the CAT, the British modified Medical 
Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea questionnaire (scores range from 0 to 4, with higher 
scores indicating more severe dyspnea),13 and the FEV1 to predict the risk of one or more 
exacerbations versus none in the first year of follow-up. We limited these receiver-operating-
characteristic curve analyses to participants with at least 1 year of follow-up.
Results
Characteristics of the Participants
We categorized current or former smokers into four mutually exclusive groups. First, we 
categorized current or former smokers according to an FEV1:FVC of 0.70 or more after 
bronchodilator use and an FVC above the lower limit of the normal range (preserved 
pulmonary function) versus mild-to-moderate COPD (GOLD stage 1 or 2); then we 
subcategorized the members of each of these two groups into participants with a CAT score 
of 10 or more (symptomatic) or a CAT score of less than 10 (asymptomatic)8 (Table 1). We

 found that 50% of current or former smokers with preserved pulmonary function had 
symptoms (Fig. 1) — a prevalence of symptoms that was slightly less than that among 
participants with GOLD stage 1 or 2 COPD (65%, P<0.001) but far greater than the 
prevalence among controls who never smoked (16%, P<0.001).
Symptomatic current or former smokers with preserved pulmonary function had elevations 
in all components of the CAT score (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available with 
the full text of this article at NEJM.org), were younger, were more likely to be nonwhite or 
Hispanic, had a higher body-mass index (BMI; the weight in kilograms divided by the 
square of the height in meters), and were more likely to be current smokers, report 
symptoms of chronic bronchitis, and report a history of wheezing and asthma (during 
childhood or ever) than those with lesser symptoms (CAT score, <10) (Table 1). Because our 
definition of symptoms was based on the CAT score and included more than just cough and 
sputum production, chronic bronchitis was present in only 33% of symptomatic current or 
former smokers (Table 1).
Current or former smokers with preserved pulmonary function who were symptomatic were 
also more likely than those who were asymptomatic to report a previous diagnosis of COPD 
by a health professional (43% vs. 11%, P<0.001), although the prevalence was lower than 
that among symptomatic participants with GOLD stage 1 or 2 COPD symptoms (80%, 
P<0.001). Even after the exclusion of participants with an FEV1:FVC of 0.70 or more but 
who nonetheless had received a health professional's diagnosis of COPD, symptoms 
remained more prevalent among current or former smokers with preserved pulmonary 
function than among healthy controls who had never smoked (38% vs. 16%, P<0.001).
Exacerbations and Activity Limitation
The median prospective follow-up time was 829 days (interquartile range, 494 to 1106). 
Whether defined on the basis of the use of antibiotics, the use of systemic glucocorticoids, 
the prescription of either of these medications, any health care utilization, or hospitalization 
or emergency department visits (severe exacerbations), the prospective rate of exacerbations 
was higher among symptomatic current or former smokers with preserved pulmonary 
function than among asymptomatic current or former smokers or among healthy controls 
who had never smoked (0.27±0.67 vs. 0.08±0.31 and 0.03±0.21 events, respectively, per 
year; P<0.001 for both comparisons) (Fig. 2, and Fig. S2 and Table S1 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). The mean distance walked in 6 minutes was also shorter in symptomatic current 
or former smokers with preserved pulmonary function (79.8±19.2% of the predicted value) 
than in asymptomatic current or former smokers (89.3± 18.8% of the predicted value) and in 
participants with GOLD stage 1 or 2 COPD symptoms and a CAT score of less than 10 
(89.2±19.3% of the predicted value) (Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Airway Disease and Emphysema
Symptomatic current or former smokers with preserved pulmonary function differed from 
asymptomatic current or former smokers in a range of lung-function measures including 
FEV1 (percentage of predicted FEV1 after bronchodilator use, 94.1±13.1% vs. 98.5±12.6%; 
P<0.001), FVC, and inspiratory capacity. Current or former smokers with preserved

 pulmonary function who were symptomatic did not have a higher percentage of lung volume 
with emphysematous features (hereafter referred to as percent emphysema) than did those 
who were asymptomatic (1.6±2.2% and 2.0±2.1%, respectively; P = 0.99) but did have a 
greater Pi10 (3.73±0.09 vs. 3.70±0.09, P = 0.002), a measure of airway-wall thickening on 
HRCT of the chest. Current or former smokers with preserved pulmonary function who were 
symptomatic were more likely than those who were asymptomatic to have an increase in 
FVC after bronchodilator use, according to the combined criteria of an increase of at least 
12% and a 200-ml increase in FVC (8% vs. 2%, P = 0.003),14 but not according to the 
criterion of percentage increase in the FVC alone. For additional details on airway disease 
and emphysema, see Figures S3 and S4 and Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix.
Potential Confounders
Given the significant differences in age, race, ethnic group, BMI, current smoking, and 
asthma between current or former smokers with preserved pulmonary function who were 
symptomatic and those who were asymptomatic, we developed multivariate models that 
controlled for these potential confounders of exacerbations as well as for sex, history of 
congestive heart failure, and history of gastroesophageal reflux disease. We found that even 
after these potential confounders were controlled for, symptomatic current or former 
smokers with preserved pulmonary function had more frequent exacerbations than did 
asymptomatic current or former smokers (Table 2). We also found persistent differences in 
the 6-minute walk distance and in lung function (Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix).
To assess the effect of active smoking, we performed analyses that were stratified according 
to current smoking status versus former smoking status and found that symptoms (CAT 
score, ≥10) were associated with elevations in all components of the CAT score in both 
current smokers and former smokers with preserved pulmonary function. We also found 
higher rates of exacerbations among symptomatic current and former smokers with 
preserved pulmonary function, regardless of current versus former smoking status, than 
among asymptomatic current or former smokers or persons who had never smoked. For 
details, see Figures S5 and S6 in the Supplementary Appendix.
Finally, we performed sensitivity analyses in which we excluded participants who reported a 
history of asthma (during childhood or ever). These analyses showed that exacerbation rates 
remained higher among current or former smokers with preserved pulmonary function who 
were symptomatic than among those who were asymptomatic (Tables S3 and S4 in the 
Supplementary Appendix).
Effect of FEV1:FVC and CAT-Score Cutoffs
We performed receiver-operating-characteristic curve analyses of the association between 
CAT score and risk of exacerbation in the first year of follow-up. Among current or former 
smokers with preserved pulmonary function, the area under the curve for the baseline CAT 
score and the occurrence of any exacerbation in the first year of follow-up was 0.68; the 
corresponding area under the curve for the FEV1 after bronchodilator use was 0.59 (P = 0.05 
for the comparison of CAT score with FEV1 after bronchodilator use). The sensitivity and 
specificity of the CAT score for at least one exacerbation in the first year of follow-up varied

 according to CAT-score cutoff. A CAT score of 10 had 75% sensitivity and 54% specificity 
for any exacerbation.
Defining preserved pulmonary function on the basis of each participant's lower limit of the 
normal range for FEV1:FVC after bronchodilator use or with the use of an FEV1:FVC cutoff 
of 0.65 did not significantly affect the association between the CAT score and any 
exacerbation (Fig. 3). However, a definition that was based on a post-bronchodilator 
FEV1:FVC cutoff of 0.75 led to fewer participants being categorized as having preserved 
pulmonary function (577 participants with the use of the 0.75 cutoff vs. 849 with the use of 
the 0.70 cutoff) and weakened the association between the CAT score and exacerbation (Fig. 
3). Finally, on receiver-operating-characteristic curve analyses, the mMRC dyspnea score 
was similar to the CAT score in its association with any exacerbation over the first year of 
follow-up in current or former smokers with preserved pulmonary function. For details, see 
Figures S7 and S8 and Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix.
Use of Respiratory Medication
In the 3 months before enrollment in the study, 42% of symptomatic current or former 
smokers with preserved pulmonary function had used inhaled bronchodilators, as compared 
with 8% of asymptomatic current or former smokers (P<0.001), and 23% had used inhaled 
glucocorticoids (vs. 3%, P<0.001) (Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). In sensitivity 
analyses, we excluded participants with any history of asthma and found that 29% of 
symptomatic current or former smokers with preserved pulmonary function used inhaled 
bronchodilators and 22% used inhaled glucocorticoids.
Discussion
In this longitudinal study, we found that respiratory symptoms, as measured by the CAT 
instrument, were common in current or former smokers, despite FEV1:FVC and FVC values 
that were in the range that is generally considered to be normal. Current or former smokers 
with preserved pulmonary function and a CAT score of 10 or more were more likely than 
those with lower CAT scores to have respiratory exacerbations, a shorter 6-minute walk 
distance, evidence of occult airway disease characterized by slightly lower lung function 
(e.g., with regard to FEV1, FVC, and inspiratory capacity), and greater airway-wall 
thickening. In contrast, the percent emphysema was low and similar among current or 
former smokers with preserved pulmonary function who were symptomatic and those who 
were asymptomatic.
Our findings were robust even with adjustment of the analyses for several important 
potential confounders. Concomitant asthma can confound CAT scores in current or former 
smokers.15 Although adults with a new diagnosis of COPD can occasionally receive an 
incorrect diagnosis of asthma, we assessed the effect of asthma by performing sensitivity 
analyses that controlled for and then excluded persons on the basis of a previous diagnosis 
of asthma (diagnosed during childhood or ever). Because retrospective data suggest that 
patients with COPD and coexisting conditions may be at higher risk for symptoms than 
those without coexisting conditions,16,17 we also controlled for relevant coexisting 
conditions, including congestive heart failure and gastroesophageal reflux disease.

 Obesity can cause abnormal findings on spirometry and accentuate dyspnea.18,19 Extremely 
obese persons (BMI, >40) were excluded from this study. However, we also controlled for 
BMI in multivariate analyses, and our findings persisted. Active cigarette smoking can cause 
cough and sputum without apparent airway obstruction, a condition that has been termed 
“simple chronic bronchitis”20 or “nonobstructive chronic bronchitis.”2 However, our 
multivariate and stratified analyses indicate that current smoking does not explain the 
elevated exacerbation rates that we observed. Nonetheless, despite our efforts, it remains 
possible that other coexisting conditions, such as undiagnosed cardiovascular and metabolic 
abnormalities, could contribute to symptoms and some respiratory “exacerbations” in these 
persons, as they do in persons with COPD.21,22 Clinical trials are needed to determine 
whether maintenance therapy with bronchodilators or inhaled glucocorticoids will alleviate 
symptoms and reduce the rate of respiratory exacerbations in this group.
Our findings agree with and extend previously published data, including studies that 
document exacerbation-like events in smokers without airway obstruction23,24 and an 
association between an increased percentage of lung that is affected by emphysema and 
increased mortality among persons without airway obstruction25 and a study that previously 
challenged the notion of “healthy smokers” by showing the presence of respiratory 
symptoms, activity limitations, and abnormalities on HRCT in smokers who did not have 
airway obstruction.26 Our data add to these previous publications by showing that chronic 
symptoms precede the exacerbations, by showing that a clinically useful tool (the CAT) can 
identify smokers at risk for exacerbations, and by providing evidence for the type of lung 
disease these symptomatic persons may have (airway disease rather than emphysema).
Our results also raise the question of whether the clinical definition of COPD should be 
adjusted or whether a new entity that includes the population of patients with smoking-
related chronic pulmonary disease who do not meet the standard criteria for airway 
obstruction should be considered. Although these current or former smokers with symptoms 
had spirometric results at enrollment that are generally considered to be normal, we do not 
know their “best” lung function. Thus, it is possible that had we been able to obtain 
measurements of lung function in the cohort of symptomatic participants in the years before 
they were enrolled in the study, we would have been able to compare the lung function at 
enrollment with the lung function at an earlier time point and show that obstruction had 
developed in these participants, even though they did not meet spirometric criteria for airway 
obstruction at enrollment.
This study has an important limitation. We did not enroll a random sample and cannot 
estimate the population prevalence of symptoms among current or former smokers with 
preserved pulmonary function. Indeed, some participants may have volunteered for this 
study because of symptoms. Neither point invalidates the central conclusion that some 
smokers with symptoms have exacerbations that are suggestive of COPD and that these 
persons are being treated as if they had COPD even though they do not meet the current 
criteria for a diagnosis of COPD.
In conclusion, respiratory symptoms and exacerbations are common in current or former 
smokers who have spirometric values that are generally considered to be within the normal

 range. Many of these patients are already being treated with respiratory medications despite 
a lack of data from clinical trials. This finding suggests that the current use of spirometry to 
define who should receive a diagnosis of COPD may not adequately cover the breadth of 
symptomatic smoking-related lung disease. Clinical trials that are directed at this large and 
under-studied population may provide better insight into appropriate treatment strategies for 
these patients.

 Figure 1. Prevalence of Respiratory Symptoms, According to Study Group
Respiratory symptoms were assessed with the use of the Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary 
Disease (COPD) Assessment Test (CAT) in controls who had never smoked, in current or 
former smokers with preserved pulmonary function as assessed by spirometry (a ratio of the 
forced expiratory volume in 1 second to the forced vital capacity [FVC] of ≥0.70 after 
bronchodilator use and an FVC above the lower limit of the normal range), and in current or 
former smokers who had COPD symptoms of Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive 
Lung Disease (GOLD) stage 1 or 2 (indicating mild and moderate disease, respectively). 
Scores on the CAT, a validated eight-question health-status instrument, range from 0 to 40, 
with higher scores indicating a greater severity of symptoms. The red line indicates the 
cutoff for more severe symptoms that is used by GOLD (CAT score, ≥10). The horizontal 
line in the boxes represents the median, and the bottom and top of the boxes the 25th and 
75th percentiles, respectively. I bars represent the upper adjacent value (75th percentile plus 
1.5 times the interquartile range) and the lower adjacent value (corresponding formula below 
the 25th percentile), and the dots outliers. P values were adjusted with Bonferroni correction 
for multiple comparisons.

 Figure 2. Prevalence of Symptoms and Risk of Respiratory Exacerbations, According to Study 
Group
Prospective respiratory exacerbations were defined as respiratory events that were treated 
with antibiotics or oral glucocorticoids, those associated with health care utilization (office 
visit, emergency department visit, or hospitalization), those that were considered to be 
severe exacerbations (i.e., that led to an emergency department visit or hospitalization), or 
any exacerbation (any of the above). T bars indicate 1 SD. Asterisks indicate a P value of 
less than 0.05, with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons, for the comparison with 
current or former smokers with preserved pulmonary function and a CAT score of less than 
10.

 Figure 3. Effect on Prospective Exacerbation Rates of Different FEV1:FVC Cutoffs to Define 
Preserved Pulmonary Function
Shown are the prospective annualized exacerbations rates of any exacerbation, according to 
different cutoffs of the ratio of the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) to the FVC. 
The definition of preserved pulmonary function that was based on the lower limit of the 
normal range (LLN) for the FEV1:FVC or that used an FEV1:FVC cutoff of 0.65 did not 
significantly change the predictive value of the CAT score for any exacerbation. The 
definition that was based on an FEV1:FVC cutoff of 0.75 weakened the predictive value of 
the CAT score for any exacerbation, although the sample size was smaller with an 
FEV1:FVC cutoff of 0.75 than with a cutoff of 0.70 (577 vs. 849 persons). Asterisks indicate 
a P value of less than 0.05, and the dagger a P value of 0.07, with Bonferroni correction for 
multiple comparisons, for the comparison with current or former smokers with a FEV1:FVC 
equal to or greater than the specified cutoff and a CAT score of less than 10.

*Plus–minus values are means ±SD. Group A included healthy controls who had never smoked, group B current or former smokers with preserved 
pulmonary function as assessed by spirometry who had a Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Assessment Test (CAT)9 score of less 
than 10, group C current or former smokers with preserved pulmonary function with a CAT score of 10 or more, group D current or former 
smokers with COPD symptoms of Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) stage 1 or 2 (indicating mild and moderate 
disease, respectively) and a CAT score of less than 10, and group E current or former smokers with COPD symptoms of GOLD stage 1 or 2 and a 
CAT score of 10 or more. Scores on the CAT, a validated eight-question health-status instrument, range from 0 to 40, with higher scores indicating 
greater severity of symptoms. Data on age and body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) were 
missing for one participant in group D, and data on the extent of smoking were missing for one participant in group A and one in group E. GERD 
denotes gastroesophageal reflux disease.

*Results are from proportional-means models that modeled exacerbations as recurrent events. Model 1 was for the comparison of persons with a CAT score of less than 10 (reference group) with those who 
had a CAT score of 10 or more. Model 2 included model 1 plus the potential confounders of body-mass index, current smoking status, age, sex, race, and ethnic group. Model 3 included model 2 plus the 
potential confounders of self-reported coexisting conditions of congestive heart failure, GERD, and diagnosis of asthma at any time. Model 4 included model 2 plus the potential confounders of self-
reported coexisting conditions of congestive heart failure, GERD, and diagnosis of asthma during childhood. CI denotes confidence interval.
