Abstract
Introduction: Home hemodialysis (HHD) facilitates increased treatment frequency, which may
improve patient outcomes. However, attrition due to technique failure limits the clinical effective-
ness of the modality. Nx2me Connected Health is a telehealth platform that enables ongoing
assessment of HHD patients using NxStage equipment, and that may reduce patient burden. We
aimed to assess whether use of Nx2me was associated with risk of HHD attrition.
Methods: We compared risks of all-cause attrition, dialysis cessation (i.e., death or transplant),
and technique failure in Nx2me users and matched control patients, using a retrospective cohort
study. We also compared the likelihood of HHD training graduation in patients who initiated use of
Nx2me during training with the likelihood in matched control patients. Matching factors included
date of HHD initiation, NxStage treatment duration at initiation of follow-up, and prescribed treat-
ment frequency. We used stratified Fine-Gray and Cox regression to compare risks, with adjust-
ment for demographic factors and vascular access modality, and stratification by matched cluster.
Findings: We identified 606 Nx2me users; 49.5% initiated use of Nx2me in <3 months after initia-
tion of HHD with NxStage equipment. Adjusted hazard ratios (AHRs) of all-cause attrition, dialysis
cessation, and technique failure were 0.80 (95% confidence interval, 0.68–0.95), 1.10 (0.86–1.41),
and 0.71 (0.57–0.87), respectively, for Nx2me users vs. matched controls. AHRs were similar in
patients who initiated use of Nx2me in <3 months after initiation of HHD. The AHR of HHD training
graduation was 1.61 (1.10–2.36) in patients who initiated use of Nx2me within 2 weeks of training
initiation vs. matched controls.
Discussion: Use of Nx2me was associated with lower risk of all-cause attrition, lower risk of tech-
nique failure, and higher likelihood of HHD training graduation. Further studies are needed to iden-
tify the mechanisms by which use of a telehealth platform may improve clinical outcomes and
reduce patient burden.

 INTRODUCTION
Home hemodialysis (HHD) facilitates delivery of more
than 3 sessions per week. Higher treatment frequency
likely reduces left ventricular mass,1 blood pressure,2
serum phosphorus,3 and post-dialysis recovery time.4,5
Between the ends of 2004 and 2013, the number of HHD
patients in the United States increased from 1800 to
8507,
although
year-over-year
growth
has
slowed
recently.6 Continued growth of home dialysis, including
both HHD and peritoneal dialysis, requires recruitment
and successful training of new patients and retention of
existing patients. A portion of home dialysis attrition is
due to kidney transplant, which is associated with
improved outcomes, relative to dialysis.7 However, most
attrition is due to death and technique failure, or conver-
sion from either HHD or peritoneal dialysis to another
dialytic modality, almost always in-center hemodialysis.
Because HHD is associated with lower mortality than in-
center hemodialysis,8–12 primary emphasis on efforts to
reduce technique failure risk is prudent. A recent US
study reported that the cumulative incidence of technique
failure was 25% at 1 year after HHD training graduation
and 35% after 2 years.13
Nx2me Connected Health (NxStage Medical, Lawrence,
MA, USA) is a telehealth platform that collects NxStage
System One cycler data and patient factors (e.g., blood
pressure, weight), transmits data to providers after each
dialysis session, and enables providers to regularly review
data in the Nx2me Clinician Portal. In contrast, usual care
involves monthly review of patient-completed session
records on paper. Better communication between patient
and provider on a telehealth platform may improve the
quality of care,14 thereby reducing the risk of technique
failure and ultimately improving HHD retention. In this
retrospective cohort study, we compared risks of all-cause
and cause-specific HHD attrition in Nx2me users and
matched control patients. We also compared the inci-
dence of training graduation in patients who initiated use
of Nx2me during HHD training to that of matched con-
trol patients.
METHODS
We analyzed data collected by NxStage Medical. Specifi-
cally, we identified US HHD patients who initiated use of
the Nx2me Connected Health platform between the date
of product launch and December 31, 2016. The date of
Nx2me initiation was defined as the date of first submis-
sion of a digital hemodialysis flowsheet. For each patient,
we recorded dates of birth, HHD training initiation, HHD
training graduation, and HHD attrition; reason for HHD
attrition; race; sex; vascular access modality; and pre-
scribed number of hemodialysis sessions per week. We
calculated age on the date of Nx2me initiation. Data
regarding vascular access and treatment frequency were
ascertained from the flowsheet on the date of Nx2me ini-
tiation. In addition, we identified candidate controls,
comprising US patients who initiated HHD training with
NxStage equipment between January 1, 2005, and
December 31, 2016, and who never subsequently initi-
ated use of the Nx2me Connected Health platform. For
each patient, we identified dates of birth, HHD training
initiation, HHD training graduation, and HHD attrition;
reason for HHD attrition; race; sex; vascular access modal-
ity; and prescribed number of hemodialysis sessions per
week. We calculated age on the date of HHD training ini-
tiation. Data regarding vascular access and treatment fre-
quency were ascertained from the most recent HHD
prescription on file.
We constructed 2000 cohorts of matched control
patients. Within each cohort, we ordered Nx2me users by
date of Nx2me initiation, heretofore the index date. For
each Nx2me user, we identified the date of HHD training
initiation, dialysis setting (i.e., in training or at home) on
the index date, the number of days d between training ini-
tiation and the index date, and prescribed number of dial-
ysis sessions per week. If the Nx2me user was in training,
we winnowed the set of candidate controls to those still
in training after d days. If the Nx2me was at home, we
winnowed the set of candidate controls to those still on
HHD at home after d days since training initiation. In
both cases, we further winnowed the subset of candidate
controls to those with the same prescribed number of
dialysis sessions per week. To ensure that candidate con-
trols were also contemporaries of the Nx2me user, we
retained those candidate controls whose date of training
initiation was within k months preceding the date of
training initiation in the Nx2me user. We iteratively
increased k from 1 to 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 12, and 24, but
stopped when we observed �3 controls. We randomly
selected 3 matched controls from this pool; variability
induced by random selection was the rationale for 2000
cohorts. We used a greedy matching algorithm, so that
matched controls were selected only once per cohort.
We followed each Nx2me user from his or her index
date and respective matched controls from the date
exactly d days after his or her date of HHD training initia-
tion, with d defined as above; thus, prior HHD treatment
duration was necessarily matched. We followed patients
until the earlier of HHD attrition or December 31, 2016.
The reason for HHD attrition was categorized as either

 dialysis cessation (death, kidney transplant) or technique
failure (due to vascular access or health issues, burden or
psychosocial issues, or other or unknown reasons).
Regarding statistical analysis, we used descriptive statis-
tics to compare characteristics of Nx2me users and con-
trols, both before and after matching. We calculated rates
and cumulative incidence of all-cause and cause-specific
attrition in Nx2me users and matched controls. We used
Fine-Gray regression to estimate adjusted hazard ratios
(AHRs) of all-cause and cause-specific attrition (i.e., dialy-
sis cessation, technique failure, and their components) in
Nx2me users vs. matched controls. Models were stratified
by matched cluster and adjusted for age, race, sex, and
vascular access modality. We estimated each summary
hazard ratio from the exponential of the mean of log haz-
ard ratios, and each associated variance from the sum of
the mean of log hazard ratio variance estimates and the
variance of log hazard ratio estimates (i.e., by the law of
total variance). Finally, we used Cox regression to esti-
mate the AHR of training graduation in patients who initi-
ated use of Nx2me within 2 weeks following initiation of
HHD training vs. matched controls.
All analyses were conducted in SAS, version 9.4 (Cary,
NC, USA).
RESULTS
There were 606 patients who initiated use of Nx2me. Rel-
ative to the index date of the first Nx2me user, there were
75 (12.4%) new users in months 1 to 6 thereafter, 140
(23.1%) in months 7 to 12, 96 (15.8%) in months 13 to
18, 65 (10.7%) in months 19 to 24, 89 (14.7%) in
months 25 to 30, and 141 (23.3%) in months 31 to 36.
Nx2me users were at 55 centers; quartiles of Nx2me users
per program were 3, 6, and 14. Patient characteristics of
Nx2me users and candidate controls are displayed in
Table 1. Relative to candidate controls, Nx2me users were
slightly younger and more likely to be black. At initiation
of Nx2me use, mean duration of HHD with NxStage
equipment was 1.18 years, although duration was <3
months in almost half of patients. Most Nx2me users dia-
lyzed with an arteriovenous fistula or central venous cath-
eter for 4 or 5 hemodialysis sessions per week. Among
2000 cohorts of matched controls, sample size varied
between 1817 and 1818 patients. Matching successfully
balanced both mean duration of HHD and prescribed
number of sessions per week at initiation of follow-up
(Table 1).
Follow-up statistics are displayed in Table 2. Nx2me
users accumulated 541.6 patient-years (mean, 0.89 years
per patient), during which 223 attrition events occurred
(rate, 41.2 events per patient-year). Among 2000 itera-
tions, matched controls accumulated 1590.6 patient-years
(0.87 years per patient) and 667.2 attrition events (48.3
events per patient-year). Rates of dialysis cessation in
Nx2me users and matched controls were 17.9 and 17.6
events per 100 patient-years, respectively, while rates of
technique failure were 23.3 and 30.7 events per 100
patient-years. In patients with NxStage treatment duration
<3 months, attrition rates in Nx2me users and matched
controls were 47.1 and 62.1 events per 100 patient-years;
almost all of that difference was due to a lower rate of
technique failure in Nx2me users.
The cumulative incidence of all-cause attrition is dis-
played in Figure 2A (all matched patients) and B (patients
with treatment duration <3 months). At 1 year, cumula-
tive incidence was 34.6% in Nx2me users and 40.2% in
matched controls. At 2 years, corresponding estimates
were 56.0% and 58.5%. In patients with treatment dura-
tion <3 months, cumulative incidence at 1 year was
37.0% in Nx2me users and 47.2% in matched controls.
The cumulative incidence of dialysis cessation was similar
in Nx2me users and matched controls (Figure 3A,B), but
the cumulative incidence of technique failure was lower
in Nx2me users than in matched controls. In all matched
patients, cumulative incidence of technique failure at 1
year was 21.6% in Nx2me users and 27.1% in matched
controls (Figure 4A), and in patients with treatment dura-
tion <3 months, cumulative incidence of technique fail-
ure at 1 year was 24.7% in Nx2me users and 36.1% in
matched controls (Figure 4B). Additional estimates of
cumulative incidence are displayed in Table 3.
Adjusted hazard ratios of attrition for Nx2me users vs.
matched controls are displayed in Table 4. The AHR of
all-cause attrition was 0.80 (95% confidence interval,
0.68–0.95) and AHRs of dialysis cessation and technique
failure were 1.10 (0.86–1.41) and 0.71 (0.55–0.87),
respectively. AHRs of death, technique failure due to bur-
den or psychosocial issues, and technique failure due to
other or unknown reasons were <1, whereas AHRs of
kidney transplant and technique failure due to vascular
access or health issues were >1; only AHRs of technique
failure due to other or unknown reasons and kidney
transplant were statistically significant. In patients with
treatment duration <3 months, the AHR of all-cause attri-
tion was 0.71 (0.56–0.90). In this subset, AHRs of all-
cause attrition were 0.62 (0.46–0.82, P 5 0.002) during
the first year of follow-up and 1.15 (0.47–2.77, P 5 0.76)
during the second year of follow-up. The pattern of AHRs
of cause-specific attrition in this subset was similar to the
pattern in all matched patients.

 There were 209 patients in HHD training at initiation
of Nx2me use; 94 (45.0%) initiated Nx2me use within
2 weeks following the initiation of training. In the
subset of 94, cumulative incidence of training gradua-
tion at 8 weeks after initiation of Nx2me use was

 estimate was 74.8% (Figure 4). Relative to the index
date, which was 7.2 days after initiation of training,
median time to training graduation was 22 days in
Nx2me users and 29 days in matched controls. The
AHR of training graduation for Nx2me users vs.

DISCUSSION
Attrition—specifically, technique failure—constrains the
clinical effectiveness of HHD and may constitute a finan-
cial barrier to provision of the modality. Little research
has assessed interventions that may reduce risk of HHD
attrition.

 technology to improve communication between patient
and provider and thereby enable timely assessment may
reduce risk. In this retrospective cohort study, we
assessed whether use of the Nx2me Connected Health
platform was associated with risk of HHD attrition. We
found that Nx2me users had 20% lower adjusted risk of
HHD attrition, due to 29% lower risk of technique failure,
and that patients who initiated use of Nx2me within
roughly 3 months of HHD training initiation had 29%
lower adjusted risk of attrition, due to 34% lower risk of
technique failure. Furthermore, we found that patients
who initiated use of Nx2me during HHD training were
more likely to complete training and begin dialysis at
home. These results suggest that use of Nx2me may
greatly improve retention during the early course of
HHD, an interval that is characterized by relatively high
risk of attrition.
Several large studies have recently described the inci-
dence of death and technique failure on HHD. Weinhandl
et al. assessed both endpoints in a study of 4201 US
HHD patients who used NxStage equipment for either 5
or 6 prescribed sessions per week. Patients were followed

 from the date of first treatment in the home. The cumula-
tive incidence of death was 12% at 1 year, 22% at 2 years,
and 30% at 3 years, while the cumulative incidence of
technique failure was 18% at 1 year, 28% at 2 years, and
32% at 3 years.15 Seshasai et al. also assessed both end-
points in a study of 2840 HHD patients who received
care from centers in a US large dialysis organization.
Patients were followed from the date of first treatment in
the home. The cumulative incidence of death was 8% at 1
year, while the cumulative incidence of technique failure
was 25% at 1 year and 35% at 2 years.13 Both studies
show that the incidence of HHD technique failure is
roughly 2 times higher during the first vs. the second year
at home. Because the eras of both cohorts predate US reg-
ulatory clearance of NxStage equipment for nocturnal
HHD,16 most patients likely underwent short-daily hemo-
dialysis. In 247 Canadian patients on nocturnal HHD, the
cumulative incidence of HHD attrition was 10% at 1 year,
22% at 2 years, and 49% at 5 years.17 Whether the rela-
tively low incidence of attrition in that cohort reflects the
effect of dialysis schedule, dialysis equipment, or country
is uncertain. In Australia and New Zealand, incidence of
the composite of death and technique failure on HHD has
also been lower than in the United States.18,19 Some vari-
ability in HHD attrition among studies may be attributed
to epidemiological methodology, including the definition
of technique failure (e.g., is death included?) and the
specification of censoring events (e.g., is transplant
included?).
Risk factors for HHD attrition necessarily reflect risk
factors for each of death, transplant, and technique fail-
ure. Regarding technique failure, Seshasai et al. listed
female sex; hypertension (vs. diabetes) as primary cause
of end-stage renal disease; urban residence; diabetes;
tobacco, alcohol, and drug use; and exclusion from the
kidney
transplant
waitlist
as
nominally
significant
(P < 0.1) risk factors.13 Central venous catheter vs. arte-
riovenous fistula or graft for vascular access was associ-
ated with higher risk of technique failure in 2 studies.20,21

 In 286 patients who underwent intensive hemodialysis,
with >95% in the home setting, each 1-session increment
in weekly treatment frequency was associated with
increased risk of a vascular access event, and both incre-
mental treatment frequency and occurrence of a vascular
access event were associated with increased risk of tech-
nique failure; 60% of the vascular access events were cate-
gorized as infection, 15% as thrombosis, 10% as stenosis,
6% as aneurysm, and 9% as other issues.22 Thus, female
sex, comorbidity, catheter dependence, and treatment fre-
quency are putative risk factors for technique failure on
HHD. Psychosocial characteristics are likely relevant risk
factors as well. Intensive hemodialysis may increase care-
giver burden, which is inversely associated with treatment
adherence.23
We found that use of Nx2me was associated with lower
risk of technique failure, but not with risk of dialysis ces-
sation. The Nx2me app that the patient uses on his or her
tablet collects hemodialysis metrics from the cycler; meas-
urements of blood pressure, temperature, and weight;
information about administered medications; and other
notes. Providers can review these data on the Nx2me Cli-
nician Portal after each hemodialysis session ends. The
Nx2me app also displays intradialytic parameters (e.g.,
arterial and venous pressures, ultrafiltration rate) and
offers real-time troubleshooting of cycler alarms. These
features, along with anecdotal evidence included in online
supplemental material, suggest several mechanisms by
which use of Nx2me may alter the course of HHD. First,
in contrast to usual care, which is characterized in the
United States by monthly review of paper flowsheets dur-
ing appointments with the nephrologist and HHD nursing
staff, ongoing assessment on a telehealth platform may
enable timely response to changes in treatment (e.g.,
shortened sessions, missed sessions, low ultrafiltration
volume) and health status (e.g., increases in blood pres-
sure, temperature, and post-dialysis weight). Incident
HHD patients exhibit high prevalence of cardiovascular
comorbidity, including heart failure,15 and may be sensi-
tive to worsening volume status. Infection control is also a
challenge in the home setting11,24,25; providers may be
able to diagnose and treat vascular access infections by
serially
assessing
variability
in
body
temperature.
Although we found that use of Nx2me was not associated
with risk of technique failure due to vascular access or
health issues, we did find that the pooled rate of death
and technique failure due to vascular access or health
issues was modestly lower in Nx2me users vs. matched
controls (with attrition events per 100 patient-years at
15.2 vs. 16.7, respectively). Second, elimination of paper
flowsheets, online troubleshooting of alarms, and the
mere knowledge of provider monitoring may increase
patient confidence. Interviews of 19 HHD patients in the
United Kingdom revealed that most patients felt scared or
worried during the early course of HHD, and that patients
and nurses found paper manuals to be impractical tools
for troubleshooting.26 Cafazzo et al. reported that conven-
tional hemodialysis patients had greater interest in noctur-
nal HHD when treatment was accompanied by remote
monitoring.27 Interviews revealed that remote monitoring
serves as surrogate nursing care, thereby alleviating care-
giver stress. Nx2me is not a real-time remote monitoring
tool, but the connection that it fosters between patient
and provider may be similar. However, any monitoring
tool can offer disadvantages. Patients may have difficulty
with a tablet or consider monitoring to be intrusive, while
providers may find that reviewing data inefficiently con-
sumes nursing hours.

Home hemodialysis attrition with telehealth technology
Hemodialysis International 2018; 22:318–327

 Surprisingly, attrition during HHD training has not
been widely quantified. In a Canadian single-center series
of 177 HHD patients, 24 (14%) patients failed to com-
plete training, whereas in 142 patients who completed
training, only 8 (6%) technique failures occurred during
the first year at home.28 Most frequently cited factors con-
tributing to training failure were inappropriate residence
(17%), deterioration in medical status (13%), inability to
cope with the burden of HHD (13%), nonadherence
(13%), and failure to pass training tests (13%). In an
English single-center series of 166 HHD patients, 12 (7%)
patients failed to complete training, with 4 failures due to
lack of confidence, 3 to lack of motivation, 2 to stress,
and 3 to other issues.29 Obviously, neither study included
US patients. We observed that roughly 1 in 4 matched
controls failed to complete training after 10–12 weeks,
and that introduction of Nx2me during the early phase of
training increased the probability of training graduation
and shortened the median time to train. Relative to reli-
ance on paper flowsheets, incorporation of familiar tech-
nology (e.g., tablet) may reduce the perceived difficulty of
training and of the burden of HHD. That introduction of
Nx2me was associated with shorter time to train contrasts
with an earlier study of simulation-based teaching, which
was not associated with shorter time to train.30 More
research is necessary to understand the role of technology
aids during HHD training.31
This study has several limitations. First, it is an obser-
vational study, so all comparisons between Nx2me users
and matched controls may suffer from residual confound-
ing. Although we exactly matched patients by NxStage
treatment duration and prescribed treatment frequency,
we did not adjust for factors other than demographic
characteristics and vascular access modality. Data about
comorbidity are not collected on HHD prescription forms;
it is possible that Nx2me users were generally healthier
than matched controls. Centers that deployed Nx2me
may have had lower HHD attrition than other centers, as
high-performing centers may have deployed Nx2me rela-
tively early. Second, information error may have induced
bias. We reported missing data regarding race and vascu-
lar access modality. Additionally, while 12% of attrition
events in HHD were due to other or unknown reasons,
23% of attrition events in matched controls were similarly
categorized. If ongoing assessment of Nx2me users
resulted in more accurate ascertainment of the cause of
HHD attrition, then AHRs of technique failure due to vas-
cular access or health issues and burden or psychosocial
issues may be upwardly biased. Thus, associations of
Nx2me use with cause-specific technique failure should
be interpreted cautiously. Third, some patients who
initiated use of Nx2me during HHD training may have
already been identified by providers as likely to complete
training. Such reverse causality may have upwardly biased
the AHR of training graduation for Nx2me users vs.
matched controls. Finally, no aspect of this study may be
applicable to HHD with equipment that uses a high vol-
ume of dialysate per session.
Home hemodialysis requires an upfront investment in
training, and transfers the work of dialysis from health
care professionals in facilities to patients in homes. Strate-
gies and tools that can improve the quality of HHD train-
ing,
improve
communication
between
patient
and
provider, and ease the patient burden of HHD may
address clinical and psychosocial factors leading to HHD
attrition.32 In other countries, periodic home visits by
nursing staff and remote monitoring are employed to sup-
port HHD, but in the United States, these practices are
uncommon. Because NxStage equipment is widely used
for HHD in the United States, the Nx2me Connected
Health platform is a practical tool that may be useful for
reducing risk of HHD technique failure in the United
States, particularly when utilization begins shortly after
initiation of HHD, and increasing likelihood of training
graduation. Future studies should assess how the use of
this platform and others like it alter health trajectories
and patient outcomes.
