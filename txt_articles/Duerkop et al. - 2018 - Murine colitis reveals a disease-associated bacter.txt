Abstract
The dysregulation of intestinal microbial communities is associated with inflammatory bowel 
diseases (IBD). Studies aimed at understanding the contribution of the microbiota to inflammatory 
diseases have primarily focused on bacteria, yet the intestine harbors a viral component dominated 
by prokaryotic viruses known as bacteriophages (phages). Phage numbers are elevated at the 
intestinal mucosal surface and phages increase in abundance during IBD, suggesting that phages 
play an unidentified role in IBD. We used a sequence independent approach for the selection of 
viral contigs and then applied quantitative metagenomics to study intestinal phages in a mouse 
model of colitis. We discovered that during colitis the intestinal phage population is altered and 
transitions from an ordered state to a stochastic dysbiosis. We identified phages specific to 
pathobiotic hosts associated with intestinal disease, whose abundances are significantly altered

 during colitis. Additionally, phage populations in healthy and diseased mice overlapped with 
phages from healthy humans and humans with IBD. Our findings indicate that intestinal phage 
communities are altered during inflammatory disease establishing a platform for investigating 
phage involvement in IBD.
Introduction
Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, are 
chronic disorders characterized by persistent inflammation of the intestine1. IBD imposes 
significant health and economic burdens worldwide2, inspiring intense investigation into the 
host and environmental factors involved in IBD. The intestinal microbiota is integral to 
intestinal health3–7 and has been implicated in IBD8. Efforts to define the composition and 
function of intestinal microbial communities during health and disease have yielded key 
insights into how the immune system maintains a beneficial relationship with the 
microbiota9.
Studies aimed at understanding the contribution of the microbiota to inflammatory diseases 
have focused primarily on the bacterial component. However, metagenomic studies have 
revealed a significant viral component of the microbiota10–13. While both eukaryotic and 
prokaryotic viruses are part of the microbiota, prokaryotic viruses, known as bacteriophages 
(phages) dominate. Intestinal phages exist in two states: as infectious lytic particles or as 
lysogenic prophage elements integrated within bacterial chromosomes14. Stimuli such as 
nutrient cues and reactive oxygen species, common signals associated with intestinal 
inflammation, can induce prophage excision and replication from bacterial 
chromosomes15–18. Increased phage infectivity during inflammation points to the immune 
system and inflammation as a driver of prophage excision and phage particle biosynthesis in 
the intestine19. However, the exact signals and mechanisms that promote prophage excision 
and lytic viral particle production in the intestine remain to be determined and the role of 
phages in intestinal inflammation is unclear.
Phages associate with intestinal mucosal surfaces and elevated levels of certain double 
stranded DNA phages have been implicated in IBD20–23. However, there is a limited 
understanding of the effects of inflammation on phage communities and whether phages 
play a role in the development of IBD. To begin to address these questions we used a 
quantitative metagenomics approach to define the abundances of host associated phage 
populations in an experimental mouse model of T cell-mediated colitis. We observed that the 
abundance of intestinal phages is altered during colitis, and that phages that infect members 
of the microbiota with pathogenic potential (pathobionts) are elevated during colitis. Our 
data show that the host inflammatory response correlates with compositional changes in 
intestinal phage communities, and highlight the need for further investigation of phage 
biology during intestinal disease.

 Results
A mouse model of intestinal colitis for the isolation of virus-like particles (VLPs).
To determine if colitis alters the intestinal phage community we studied a mouse model of T 
cell adoptive transfer that exhibits chronic inflammation of the colon (Fig. S1a)24,25. 
Rag1−/− mice were injected with CD4+ CD45RBHigh T cells or saline, housed in individual 
cages and monitored for six weeks (42 days) for weight loss and inflammatory markers (Fig. 
S1b & S1c). Feces were collected from each mouse at day 0, 14, and 42 (Fig. S1a), and 
genomic DNA from the whole metagenome and virus-like particles (VLPs) was isolated. 
Whole metagenome and VLP DNAs were sequenced without amplification. Similar to Kang 
et al., the resulting viromes are among the first quantitative viromes available from the 
microbiota26. A similar number of VLPs were recovered from feces when counted by 
epifluorescence microscopy (Fig. S1d). Bacterial composition analysis of the fecal 
microbiota showed an increased abundance of Proteobacteria at 42 days (Fig. S1e). Similar 
results were obtained in mice co-housed with their treatment groups for 30 days after T cell 
transfer (Fig. S2a). These data support prior reports showing that Proteobacterial 
communities expand during intestinal inflammation27–29.
Generation and verification of de novo VLP contigs
To alleviate the limitation of a priori knowledge of virus gene sequence features during virus 
contig identification we developed a sequence independent approach. Our method employs 
the quantitative comparison of contigs between whole metagenomes and VLP metagenomes, 
making use of information obtained from physical VLP enrichments. We used sequence 
based approaches to validate these contigs as viral (see Materials and Methods). We used a 
quantitative metagenomic approach to detect viruses whose abundances differ between 
healthy and inflamed mice using an established method of read recruitment to the de novo 
assembled contigs (Fig. S3)26,30. Although we used a read mapping ratio approach to limit 
contigs of potential bacterial origin within our VLP contig dataset, we cannot rule out the 
presence of bacterial genomic DNA sequences in viral contigs originating from induced 
prophages. Our custom VLP database consisted of 1104 contigs ranging in size from 2 kb to 
486 kb. Approximately 80% of contigs were 2 to 25 kb in length, 16% were 25 to 100 kb, 
and the remaining 4% were >100 kb.
To validate the viral origin of the contigs we employed two separate approaches. First, we 
compared their open reading frames to a set of 25,281 viral protein families (VPFs) from 
known viruses described in Paez-Espino et al31. We identified 278 viral contigs with >70% 
of genes belonging to VPFs (Table S1). We found 600 and 118 viral contigs with 35–70% 
and less than 35% of their genes belonging to VPFs, respectively (Table S1). The remaining 
108 contigs contained genes that did not match any VPF. Contrary, to the standard 
application of VPFs for the extraction of viral sequences from metagenomes, which requires 
meeting stringent criteria, we considered our viral contigs validated if they contained at least 
one VPF. We further validated our VLP contigs using VirSorter, a tool that identifies viral 
sequences from complex microbial DNA samples32. VirSorter identified 156 of the VLP 
contigs as phages and of these, 152 were also identified using VPFs (Table S2).

 We next compared our contigs to the IMG/VR viral database, which contains over 264,000 
metagenomic viral contigs and 8,000 viral isolate genomes33. We used a sequence-based 
classification framework to group closely-related viral sequences31. Of the 1104 contigs in 
our database, 382 viral contigs (representing 34% of the total contigs) grouped within 142 
viral clusters (Table S3). All viral contigs from IMG/VR that clustered with the contigs from 
this study originated from intestinal viruses (Table S3). The remaining 722 viral contigs did 
not group with any viral contigs in IMG/VR or our curated database and were considered 
singletons.
Quantitative metagenomics reveals alterations to phage communities during colitis.
To determine whether compositional changes occur within the phage community during 
colitis, we mapped our VLP reads to all publicly available Caudovirales genomes 
downloaded from NCBI, all viral isolate and metagenomes in IMG/VR and our curated VLP 
contig database.
Mapping to phage reference genomes from NCBI showed divergence of the phage 
community in T cell-treated animals at 42 days, suggesting that disease status correlates 
with an altered fecal phage community (Fig. 1a). Enterobacteriaceae-specific phages were 
enriched in T cell-treated mice compared to healthy controls at day 42 (Fig. 1b and Table 
S4), including phages resembling those that infect Proteobacteria that expand during 
inflammation (Fig. S1f & S2b). Reads that mapped to phages predicted to infect Enterococci 
were also more abundant in T cell-treated animals on day 42 (Fig. 1b and Table S4). These 
data correlated with an increased proportion of phage reads that mapped to known viruses in 
colitic mice (Fig. S4). The presence of some phages correlated with an increased abundance 
of prospective host bacteria, suggesting that phage interact with known intestinal 
pathobionts during colitis. (Fig. S1f & Fig. S2b). In addition, VLP reads that mapped to 
Caudovirales phage families, including the Siphoviridae, Myoviridae and Podoviridae, were 
elevated in T cell-treated animals (Fig. 1c). These data accord with the altered phage 
abundances in human IBD patients21. The VLP reads that mapped to the Caudovirales 
genome dataset accounted for less than 0.01% of the total VLP reads per group of mice, 
indicating that most of the phage specific VLP reads are unique to our dataset or fall below 
our identity cutoff.
To improve VLP read mapping for our samples we mapped the VLP reads to the IMG/VR 
database, as well as the 1104 viral contigs extracted from assemblies of our dataset. 
IMG/VR contains viral isolate genomes and metagenomes from ocean, soil, sewage and 
animal hosts33. A total of 1068 viral genomes from IMG/VR recruited reads from our mouse 
VLP samples (Table S5). 958 of these viral genomes originate from intestinal samples 
including 406 from humans, 417 from mouse, 102 from rat and 33 from other mammals 
(Fig. S5 & Table S5). This increased our read mapping percentage by two orders of 
magnitude (1.2%).
We next mapped each sample’s VLP reads to our curated database of 1104 viral contigs (Fig 
2a). Using the curated contig dataset allowed us increase our read mapping average to 22% 
(Table S6), yet 78% of the reads were not mapped to any database. Comparative read 
mapping analysis of day 0 samples showed both T cell-treated and control animals had a

 similar viral community. However, as colitis progressed the viral community shifted, with 
the most marked shift occurring 42 days after T cell treatment (Fig. 2a, 2b & 2c). This shift 
in viral community composition was also observed in animals that remained co-housed with 
their treatment group for the duration of the experiment (Fig. S6). Thus, T cell-mediated 
colitis was associated with a divergence of the intestinal viral community.
The shift in phage community composition at day 42 reflected a decrease in viral contig 
abundances (Table S7) and a significant loss of diversity leading to an increased dissimilarity 
between healthy and diseased mice (Fig. 2c). Rarefaction analysis revealed sufficient read 
mapping coverage for all samples, ruling out low sampling as a cause of the divergence (Fig. 
S7). In addition to altered phage abundances there was a marked divergence in the bacterial 
community during colitis (Fig. S8). We found that some viral contigs differed significantly 
between control and diseased mice at day 42 (Fig. 2d). Of the contigs that were statistically 
significant, 35 contigs were at least 10-fold more abundant and 41 contigs were at least 8-
fold less abundant during colitis.
When comparing the presence of various contigs between healthy and colitic animals, we 
observed a stochastic pattern consistent with a random distribution of contigs within animals 
at various time points (Fig. 3a). 4% of the VLP contigs were shared between healthy animals 
as compared to only 1% in animals with colitis (Fig. 3a). Furthermore, the colitic animals 
contained a greater number of singleton viral contigs (Fig 3b). Although contigs shared 
between healthy animals accounted for a small proportion of the total VLPs, these data 
suggest that the viral community diverges as the intestine transitions from a healthy to 
dysbiotic state.
At day 42 there was a dramatic reduction in the number of reads recruited to VLP contigs in 
colitic mice. This was most pronounced for mouse number two (Fig. 2a). 20% of the 
mapped reads from this animal aligned with four highly abundant contigs. Three of these 
contigs were among the most differentially abundant contigs at the height of disease (Fig. 
2d). An 18.4 kb contig recruited 8.3% of the reads and the other three contigs of 136.6 kb, 
145.5 kb and 176.1 kb recruited the remaining 11.7 % of the reads (Fig. S9 & Table S8). 
Although these contigs recruited a large proportion of the VLP reads from T cell-treated 
animals, read recruitment to these contigs varied between animals (Fig. S9).
We were able to assign phage taxonomy or bacterial host information to two of these four 
contigs. We assigned phage taxonomy or host information using a list of signature phage 
orthologous groups (POGs), phage-encoded tRNAs, and clustered regularly interspaced 
short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) spacers that serve as a historical record of phage-bacteria 
interactions34–36. The 145.5 kb contig contained a tRNA 100% identical to the genus 
Acholeplasma, a member of the Mollicutes. This contig had a region of ~8 kb that 
resembled known phage genes (Fig. S9 & Table S8). The 136.7 kb contig matched a POG 
belonging to Spounaviridae, a subfamily of the Myoviridae composed of phages known to 
infect pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus37.
Of the remaining 35 statistically significant contigs of high abundance, only three other 
contigs could be assigned taxonomy or host information (Table S9). A tRNA broadly

 connected one contig to either the Firmicutes or Tenericutes, one contig was assigned to a 
POG representing the genus Betalipothrixviruses which infect Archaea38, and the third 
contig was linked to the Clostridiales through a CRISPR spacer. Although we assigned 
taxonomy or host information to only a few significantly different contigs, this was expected 
based on previous studies21,39. This highlights the power of our approach for identifying 
VLPs independent of existing database information. Of the 41 contigs with significantly 
reduced abundance, CRISPR spacer and tRNA matching revealed six to be potential 
Clostridiales phages and two were identified as phages that infect the Lachnospiraceae 
family within the Clostridiales. These data indicate that colitis is associated with a reduction 
in Clostridiales-like phages.
VLP identification reveals changes in the phage community during colitis
We next determined taxonomic or host assignments for all 1104 contigs in the curated VLP 
database. We were able to assign 116 contigs (11%) to a specific phage taxonomic group or 
host designation using one or more of the three identification methods described above. The 
number of total assigned contigs is smaller than the number of contigs predicted to be of 
viral origin using VPFs because numerous VPFs only contain viral hallmark genes and lack 
taxonomic or host information. CRISPR spacer matching resulted in the greatest number of 
assigned contigs (50 contigs), followed by tRNAs (41 contigs) and POGs (36 contigs) (Fig. 
S10). Both tRNA and CRISPR spacer matching identified 11 shared contigs, accounting for 
27% and 22% of the total contigs identified using those methods respectively. Of the 36 
contigs identified using POGs, 26% belonged to the Myoviridae, 18% to the Siphoviridae 
and 37% to the Podoviridae. The remaining 19% of contigs matched several archaeal viruses 
belonging to the Fuselloviridae and Lipothrixviridae (Fig. S10a).
POG matching identified numerous phages with taxonomic signatures of known 
Enterobacteriaceae-like phages. This is consistent with the increased abundance of 
Proteobacteria in the metagenomes of T cell-treated mice and the mouse VLP reads mapping 
with higher abundance to Proteobacterial phage genomes (Fig. S1e & Fig. 1a). Since viruses 
within a given POG can infect very different bacterial hosts, we cannot completely exclude 
that the contigs classified as Enterobacteriaceae-like phages are from viruses that infect 
bacteria outside the Proteobacteria. Additionally, POGs identified phages taxonomically 
related to phiCD119, phiKZ, phiHp1, AHJD and Spounavirinae phages that infect 
pathobionts including Clostridium difficile, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus 
influenza, and Staphylococcus aureus37,40–42 (Fig. S10a & Table S9). We were able to 
obtain order, family and in some cases genus-specific identification of multiple phage 
contigs using tRNA and CRIPSR spacer matching. As expected, the most highly represented 
phages in our database matched hosts in the phyla Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes. Firmicute-
specific phages were dominated by those predicted to infect Clostridiales bacteria including 
phages specific for Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae and Clostridia. The next most 
prevalent were phages specific for the Streptococci. Bacteroidetes phages were almost 
exclusively represented by Alistipes phages (Fig. S10b, S10c & Table S9).
To identify differences in the abundance of host-assigned phage contigs we grouped the 
contigs based on host identity, summed the read-mapping derived abundances and averaged

 these values for healthy and colitic animals. At the order level there was a significant 
decrease in the abundance of Clostridiales phages in T cell-treated animals (Fig. 4a). This 
supports our finding, from the analysis of the differentially abundant contigs that a2 
reduction in Clostridiales phages occurs in colitis. When these data were stratified into 
family- and genus-specific contigs we discovered that phages predicted to infect Clostridium 
sp. KLE 1755 and some Lachnospiraceae bacteria decreased, whereas Lachnospiraceae 
phages that target strain COE1 were more abundant during colitis (Fig. 4b, 4c & 4d). 
Additionally, Clostridiales phages predicted to infect Clostridium difficile were more 
abundant in the T cell-treated animals (Fig. 4e).
Streptococcus sp. phages were more abundant in T cell-treated animals, supporting a prior 
report on intestinal phages from IBD patients21, as well as phages predicted to infect 
Alistipes (Fig. 4f & 4g). The 16S rRNA gene read abundances for the host bacteria infected 
by these phages were not statistically different between healthy and colitic animals, although 
Alistipes trended toward lower abundance during colitis (Fig. 4h). This suggests that shifts 
in phage abundance are not solely dependent on bacterial host density. Together, these data 
support the idea of a defined phage community during colitis.
Mouse VLP reads map to phages from human phageomes
To determine if mouse VLP sequencing reads matched intestinal phages from humans, we 
mapped our VLP reads from healthy and colitic animals to groups of phage contigs derived 
from healthy humans and humans with IBD21,39. A total of 38 contigs, accounting for 25% 
of the healthy human phageome, recruited reads from both healthy and colitic animals (Fig. 
5a). Comparative analysis of the read mapping frequency revealed multiple healthy human 
phage contigs that recruited fewer reads from colitic animals and seven phages that were 
exclusively in healthy animals (Fig. 5a). Consistent with the observation that more contig 
connections were maintained under healthy conditions across time points (Fig. 3a), these 
data suggest that the healthy component of the murine phageome overlaps with that of 
humans and that the abundances of these phages decrease during colitis.
We next assessed the abundance of VLP reads that mapped to a set of 519 VLP contigs 
generated from the Chicago cohort of Crohn’s and ulcerative colitis patients described by 
Norman et al.21. A total of 169 contigs, accounting for 33% of VLP contigs generated from 
IBD patients, recruited reads from either healthy or colitic animals (Fig. 5b). Phages from 
diseased humans recruited more reads from colitic animals and in some cases only human 
IBD phage contig specific reads were represented in colitic mice (Fig. 5b). Thus, the murine 
phageome overlaps with that of humans both during intestinal health and disease.
Discussion
Using a metagenomics approach, we discovered that intestinal phage communities in colitic 
animals undergo compositional shifts that are similar to those observed in human IBD 
patients21. Accordingly, we observed a decrease in phage community diversity and an 
expansion of subsets of phages in animals with colitis. We observed decreased abundance of 
certain phages, such as Clostridiales phages, during colitis. Phage populations that expanded 
during colitis were frequently connected to pathobiont hosts that benefit from or are linked

 to intestinal inflammation. Not all colitis-specific phage expansion reflected increased 
abundances of assigned bacterial hosts, suggesting that alternative mechanisms drive altered 
phage abundances during colitis.
We hypothesize that inflammation or other host defenses alter phage abundances during 
colitis. Such stresses could produce ecological disturbances in the intestinal environment, 
driving alterations within the viral community. Disturbances leading to the stochastic 
assembly of microbial communities have been described in other ecological networks43,44, 
suggesting a plausible explanation for the high level of variation and divergence observed in 
the viral communities of colitic animals.
Changes in viral community structure during colitis could have several underlying causes. 
For instance, most intestinal phages are integrated into bacterial chromosomes as lysogenic 
prophages10,11. Host inflammatory products could enhance prophage excision leading to 
increased phage abundances. Nutrient availability may also impact prophage excision. 
During inflammation, the metabolic landscape of the intestine dramatically changes and 
bacteria adapt to this environment45. Furthermore, prophage excision from bacterial 
chromosomes and progression to the lytic cycle are linked to nutrient availability14,18. As 
dysbiotic bacterial communities establish during colitis and competition for resources 
ensues, increased prophage induction could account for the emergence of specific phages.
Our findings suggest that members of the Spounaviridae subfamily of phages could serve as 
informative markers for colitis. Additionally, during colitis there was an overall heightened 
abundance of phages predicted to infect Streptococci and phages that target Alistipes 
bacteria. Streptococcal phages are abundant in human IBD patients21 thus highlighting the 
possibility of using these phages as disease markers. Elevated abundance of Alistipes phages 
was unexpected as these phages associate with members of the Bacteroidetes whose 
abundances decline during dysbiosis46,47. Thus, prophage excision in the Bacteroidetes 
might be driven by colitis and could be an indicator of disease.
Overall, we observed the most dramatic changes in phages predicted to infect pathobionts. 
Since phages infect bacteria with strain-level specificity48–50, elevated abundances of 
specific phages during IBD could serve as a proxy for strain-level resolution of disease-
causing bacteria. This correlated with both reduced and increased abundances of phage 
DNAs in colitic animals that had similarity to phage genomes from healthy humans and 
humans with IBD respectively. Previous studies have shown that there is a high degree of 
inter-individual variation among human intestinal phage communites10,11. We were 
surprised to discover that there is significant overlap of murine intestinal phage reads with 
phages from both healthy humans and humans with IBD. These data suggest that 
experimental colitis in mice is a suitable model for the study of phage-bacterial interactions 
in the intestine, and that the findings from this model could be relevant to human disease.

Animals.
Two-week-old male C57BL6/J Rag1−/− mice51 were weaned and co-housed together in the 
same cage for four weeks. At six weeks of age three mice C57BL6/J Rag1−/− mice were 
administered 5×105 naïve CD4+ CD45RBHigh T cells via retro-orbital injection. A second 
group of three C57BL6/J Rag1−/− mice were given a saline injection as a control. All mice 
were housed in either separate cages or by treatment group for the duration of the 
experiment. The sample size of three mice per group was used because this was the 
minimum number of mice needed for reliable statistical analyses. Four male wild-type 
C57BL6/J mice aged six to eight weeks were used as spleen donors for T cell isolation. 
Male germ free C57BL6/J Rag1−/− mice were reared in sterile isolators as described 
previously52. Fecal samples from three eight week old germ free Rag1−/− were pooled in 
duplicate. After co-housing for four weeks experimental mice were randomly assigned to 
treatment groups. It was not possible to blind researchers to the treatment conditions of the 
animals prior to experimentation. The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of UT 
Southwestern Medical Center approved all animal protocols.
T cell isolation.
The spleens from four male wild-type C57BL6/J mice were dissected and added to RPMI 
(BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Gemini Bio-Products, 
Sacramento, CA). The spleens were homogenized using the frosted ends of sterile 
microscope slides and passed through a 70 μm cell strainer. CD4 cells were negatively 
selected using a Dynabeads Untouched Mouse CD4 Cells Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). 
Purified mouse CD4 cells were Fc-blocked using purified rat anti-mouse CD16/CD32, clone 
2.4G2, (BD Biosciences) followed by two color staining using anti-mouse CD4-FITC, clone 
RM4–5 and anti-mouse CD45 RB-APC, clone C363–16A (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA). 
CD4+ CD45RBHigh cells were collected on a MoFlo XDP cell-sorting machine at the UT 
Southwestern Flow Cytometry Core Facility.
Metagenomic DNA isolation.
VLPs and their DNA were isolated as described previously53. Briefly, fecal pellets were 
homogenized in 2 ml of SM+ buffer50 and 1.3 ml sample volume was clarified by 
centrifugation (2500g for 5 min followed by 5000g for 15 min at 4ºC). The supernatant was 
filtered through a 0.45 ¼m Millex-HV syringe filter (EMD Millipore, Burlington, MA) and 
treated with 100 units of DNase I (Roche, Pleasanton, CA) and 15 units of RNase A (Sigma, 
St. Louis, MO) for 1 hr at 37ºC. VLPs were not further purified by cesium chloride (CsCl) 
gradient centrifugation. Although CsCl purification is efficient at removing potential 
contaminating nucleic acids, this method is not suited for quantitative metagenomic 
comparison of a large number of samples due to its limited throughput53. Additionally, this 
method discriminates against specific phages and can vary in reproducibility due to the 
necessity of removing the VLPs from precise locations within the gradient that are difficult 
to normalize between samples53. Therefore, we proceeded to isolate VLP DNA from filtered 
and DNase/RNase treated samples by adding 100 mM EDTA, 50 ¼g/ml Proteinase K (New 
England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) and 0.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate to each sample and to

 incubate them at 56ºC for 30 min. The samples were extracted with an equal volume of 
phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol 25:24:1 (Sigma) followed by an additional extraction 
using just chloroform. The DNA was precipitated with isopropanol and cleaned using a 
MinElute Reaction Cleanup Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Following a rigorous VLP 
purification strategy can greatly reduce the possibility of contaminating prokaryotic host 
genomic DNA that can lead to false positive viral gene identification from the VLP 
fraction54,55. For the isolation of total metagenomic DNA, the remaining 0.7 ml of fecal 
material was treated with 5 mg/ml lysozyme (Amersco, Solon, OH) at 37ºC for 30 min. The 
samples were transferred to 2 ml Lysing Matrix B tubes (MP Biomedicals, Solon, OH) and 
were disrupted by bead-beating in a Bullet Blender 5 (Next Advance, Troy, NY) at a speed 
setting of 9 for 1 minute followed by a 2 minute incubation on ice. This was repeated 5 
times. Samples were centrifuged at 16,300g for 1 minute and DNA from the supernatant was 
extracted and purified as described above.
Metagenomic DNA sequencing.
DNA sequencing was performed using Illumina HiSeq 2500 Rapid Run at 150 cycles in 
paired-end mode. DNA concentration and quality was determined using the Qubit dsDNA 
HS kit (Invitrogen) and a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). DNA libraries were 
prepared using a KAPA High Throughput Library Preparation Kit with standard PCR library 
amplification (KAPA Biosystems, Wilmington, MA). TruSeq adapters (Illumina, San Diego, 
CA) with 6 bp indices were used to enable multiplexed sequencing. Illumina libraries were 
size selected using AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN). Library quality 
was measured on a Bioanalyzer 2100 by product size and concentration. On average, 43 
million paired-end whole metagenome reads and 30 million paired-end VLP reads were 
generated for each sample. Sequencing reads were demultiplexed using the 6 bp TruSeq 
adapter sequences allowing for one mismatch using the Illumina CASAVA software. DNA 
quality control, HiSeq 2500 sequencing and library preparation was performed by the UT 
Southwestern Eugene McDermott Center for Human Growth and Development Next 
Generation Sequencing Core.
Decontamination and processing of reads.
Read decontamination and trimming was performed using the BBMap short read aligner 
v36.99 (https://sourceforge.net/projects/bbmap). Raw reads were mapped to the internal 
Illumina control phiX174 (J02482.1) and the mouse (mm10) and human (hg38) reference 
genomes using the bbsplit algorithm with default settings. The resulting unmapped reads 
were adapter trimmed and low-quality reads and reads of insufficient length were removed 
using the bbduk algorithm with the following parameters: ktrim=lr, k=20, mink=4, 
minlength=20, qtrim=f. These reads went through a second round of decontamination by 
mapping to a set of reference contigs assembled from samples obtained from the feces of 
germ-free C57BL6/J Rag1−/− mice using bbsplit. These final unmapped reads constituted 
the cleaned M and P read sets.
Read based quantification of taxa.
To assess microbial community composition we used phyloFlash Version 2.0 (https://
github.com/HRGV/phyloFlash) to reconstruct 16S and 18S rRNA genes from the Illumina

 read datasets and quantified taxa by read mapping. 16S and 18S rRNA genes were classified 
with phyloFlash against the SILVA SSU Ref NR 99 database 12356. Taxa abundances were 
summed at the phylum level and the genus level for specific genera.
Metagenomic assembly.
Whole metagenome, VLP and germ free mouse decontamination reference assemblies were 
performed using the IDBA-UD assembler v1.1.157. Prior to assembly, paired end reads were 
interleaved using the fq2fa merge filter command within IDBA-UD. Assemblies were 
generated in the absence of error correction using the default parameters.
Construction of the curated VLP contig database.
VLP reads were assembled into 18 sets of contigs, with one set per animal per time point. 
VLP contigs smaller than 2 kb were removed from each sample’s contig set. Using these 
pruned contig sets, each sample’s VLP and whole metagenome reads were mapped to their 
corresponding sample’s contigs using the bbmap algorithm within BBMap with the 
following settings: ambiguous=random, qtrim=lr, minid=0.97. Read mapping coverage for 
each contig was generated by setting the ‘covstats’ parameter. The percentage of reads that 
mapped to each contig was used to calculate a read-mapping ratio per contig (VLP/whole 
metagenome). We assumed that if this ratio was greater than 1 (i.e., more VLP reads than 
whole metagenome reads mapped to a contig), then these contigs were more highly 
represented in the viral fraction and likely represented genuine viral contigs. From each of 
the 18 read mapping sets we selected and pooled the top 100 contigs based on the largest 
ratios. We removed redundancy by sequence clustering using cd-hit-est58 at an identity 
threshold of 99%, resulting in a collection of 1104 unique contigs that constituted our 
curated viral contig database.
Quantitative read mapping.
The complete genomes of 1993 Caudovirales genomes downloaded from NCBI, a group of 
154 phage genomes found in healthy humans from the Manrique study39, contigs obtained 
from a Chicago cohort of IBD patients from the Norman study21 and our curated viral contig 
database generated from healthy and colitic mice were used as mapping references using the 
bbmap algorithm. For the Caudovirales genomes and the curated viral contig database we 
used the following bbmap parameters: ambiguous=random, qtrim=lr, minid=0.97. For the 
Manrique and Norman datasets we decreased the identity threshold to minid=0.90, to 
account for increased heterogeneity between mouse and human samples39. Read mapping 
statistics for each contig were generated by setting the ‘scafstats’ parameter. For the 
Caudovirales genomes, the Manrique dataset and the Norman dataset the total number of 
unambiguous reads per contig were tallied and averaged across animal treatments and time 
points. For the curated viral contig database, the percent ambiguous and unambiguous 
mapped reads were combined for each contig and compared between treatments and time 
points.

 Confirming viral contigs, establishing level of similarity with existing viruses, and defining 
host associations.
We used a curated set of 25,281 viral protein families (VPFs)31 and the VirSorter database32 
to compare open reading frames within the 1104 viral contigs from this study for viral 
protein similarity. VPFs are a recently developed tool yet to be widely used for virus 
discovery. VPFs have been benchmarked for high specificity for viruses and only in rare 
cases a VPF may include a prokaryotic host protein. Additionally, we obtained taxonomic 
information for viral contigs by using phage orthologous gene clusters (POGs) that are 
recognized as taxon-specific signatures for virus classification35. For all Hidden Markov 
Models searches we used the algorithm hmmsearch with trusted cutoffs from the hmmer 
web server59 and an e-value below 1e-05. To cluster viral sequences we used the public viral 
database IMG/VR composed of over 264 thousand metagenomic viral contigs and almost 8 
thousand virus isolates33. We used the sequence-based classification framework described in 
Paez-Espino et al.31 for grouping closely related viral sequences. The method relies on both 
nucleotide identity and the fraction of total alignment for pairwise comparisons of viral 
sequences. We used BLASTn in the Blast+ package60 to find hits with an e-value cutoff of 
1e−10 and at least 50% identity across ≥ 50% of the shortest sequence length. We used three 
different computational methods to predict host-virus connections: i) Grouping with isolated 
viruses, metagenomic viral contigs and host or taxonomic association using POGs. ii) 
Prokaryotic CRISPR spacer matching to viral contigs requiring at least 95% identity over 
the whole spacer length. To acquire CRISPR spacers from our experimental dataset each 
animal’s whole metagenome reads from each time point were combined and contigs were 
assembled using IDBA-UD. Binning of metagenome assemblies to retrieve genome bins was 
performed using MetaWatt61 with default settings except avg read length=75, contig length 
threshold=500 and minimum bin seed size=5000. Taxonomy was assigned to each bin based 
on MetaWatt taxonomy binning. CRISPR repeat patterns and spacers were extracted from 
bins using metaCRT62 with the following settings minNR=4, minRL=19, maxRL=48. 
Spacers were extracted from CRISPRs and aligned to the curated viral contig database using 
the seal algorithm in the BBMap software suite with the k parameter set to 19. iii) Matching 
viral transfer RNA sequences to bacterial transfer RNAs. We identified tRNAs from our 
viral contig set using ARAGORN v1.263 and compared these against isolate microbial 
genomes in IMG/M64 using BLASTn. Only hits with a 100% identity over 100% of the 
length were considered. There are multiple methods available for phage host identification 
from VLP metagenomes65. We chose to use CRISPRs and tRNAs to make host connections 
because CRISPR matching does not depend on preexisting databases for sequence 
comparison and tRNAs are common features of phage genomes that provide host specific 
information without the need for a reference phage genome.

tailed t-tests testing for changes to viral contig abundances during colitis. The multiple-
testing problem was corrected by calculating a permutation-based false discovery rate 
(FDR). A FDR cutoff of 0.05 was used. Horizontal lines indicate the FDR based p-value cut 
off for statistical significance for each time point when comparing the contig abundances 
between healthy and diseased animals. Data points highlighted in blue and red indicate 
contigs that are significantly reduced or enriched in colitic animals respectively and grey 
data points indicate contigs for which phage host taxonomic assignments could be made. 
The data represent three independent mice per group. ** p=0.0001, * p=0.01 by Kruskal-
Wallis test and a post hoc Dunn’s test for multiple comparisons.

Colitic animals share less VLP connections relative to healthy animals. (a) Connected VLP 
contigs (both shared and singleton contigs) across all time points and animals, from only 
healthy animals (Core healthy) which includes animals prior to T cell treatment and T cell 
treated animals 14 and 42 days post T cell administration (Core colitis). Circle diameter 
indicates the number of singleton VLP contigs that do not cluster with contigs in IMG/VR or 
to contigs within the curated database. Line thickness represents the number of shared 
contigs between animals and time points. (b) Abundance of singleton VLP contigs between 
mock and T cell treated animals across the time series. The data represent three independent 
mice per group. Error bars represent ± standard error of the mean. * p=0.02 by two-tailed 
unpaired Student’s t-test, NS – not significant.

Phage taxonomy and host bacterial assignments for curated VLP contigs reveals differential 
abundances of phages that infect both commensals and pathobionts during colitis. (a) All 
phage contigs linked to the order Clostridiales. Each data point represents a unique 
Clostridiales phage contig found in both healthy and diseased animals. (b-e) Family and 
genus-specific phages constituting lower taxonomic ranks of the Clostridiales. (f-g) 
Abundances of Streptococcal phages and Alistipes phages. (h) Bacterial 16s rDNA 
sequencing read abundances for the C – Clostridiales, L – Lachnospiraceae, S – Streptococci 
and A – Alistipes. In panels b-g, lines connect shared contigs between healthy and diseased 
animals. The data represent three independent mice per group. Error bars represent ± 
standard error of the mean. **** p<0.0001, *** p=0.0002, ** p=0.008, *p=0.004 by two-
tailed nonparametric Mann-Whitney test.

 Figure 5. 
VLP reads from healthy and colitic animals share identity to human associated intestinal 
phages. (a) VLP reads from healthy (mock) and colitic (T cells) mice 42 days post T cell 
treatment were mapped against a cohort of conserved phage contigs found in healthy 
humans. (b) VLP reads from healthy (mock) and colitic (T cells) mice 42 days post T cell 
treatment were mapped against phage contigs assembled from IBD patients. Panel b shows 
the top 85 IBD phage contigs with read recruitment. Normalized read abundance is the total 
number of mapped reads divided by the length of the contig in base pairs. Contigs 
highlighted in red indicate contigs which are only found in healthy or colitic mice. The data 
represent three independent mice per group. Error bars represent ± standard error of the 
mean. * p<0.1 by a two sample unpaired t-test with a permutation-based false discovery rate 
cutoff of 0.1 (Supplementary Table 10).
