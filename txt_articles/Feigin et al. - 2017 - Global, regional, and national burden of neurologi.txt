Global, regional, and national burden of neurological 
disorders during 1990–2015: a systematic analysis for the 
Global Burden of Disease Study 2015
GBD 2015 Neurological Disorders Collaborator Group*
Summary
Background Comparable data on the global and country-specific burden of neurological disorders and their trends are 
crucial for health-care planning and resource allocation. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors 
(GBD) Study provides such information but does not routinely aggregate results that are of interest to clinicians 
specialising in neurological conditions. In this systematic analysis, we quantified the global disease burden due to 
neurological disorders in 2015 and its relationship with country development level. 
Methods We estimated global and country-specific prevalence, mortality, disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), years 
of life lost (YLLs), and years lived with disability (YLDs) for various neurological disorders that in the GBD classification 
have been previously spread across multiple disease groupings. The more inclusive grouping of neurological 
disorders included stroke, meningitis, encephalitis, tetanus, Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias, Parkinson’s 
disease, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, motor neuron disease, migraine, tension-type headache, medication overuse 
headache, brain and nervous system cancers, and a residual category of other neurological disorders. We also analysed 
results based on the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a compound measure of income per capita, education, and 
fertility, to identify patterns associated with development and how countries fare against expected outcomes relative 
to their level of development.
Findings Neurological disorders ranked as the leading cause group of DALYs in 2015 (250·7 [95% uncertainty interval 
(UI) 229·1 to 274·7] million, comprising 10·2% of global DALYs) and the second-leading cause group of deaths (9·4 
[9·1 to 9·7] million], comprising 16·8% of global deaths). The most prevalent neurological disorders were tension-
type headache (1505·9 [UI 1337·3 to 1681·6 million cases]), migraine (958·8 [872·1 to 1055·6] million), medication 
overuse headache (58·5 [50·8 to 67·4 million]), and Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias (46·0 
[40·2 to 52·7 million]). Between 1990 and 2015, the number of deaths from neurological disorders increased by 
36·7%, and the number of DALYs by 7·4%. These increases occurred despite decreases in age-standardised rates of 
death and DALYs of 26·1% and 29·7%, respectively; stroke and communicable neurological disorders were 
responsible for most of these decreases. Communicable neurological disorders were the largest cause of DALYs in 
countries with low SDI. Stroke rates were highest at middle levels of SDI and lowest at the highest SDI. Most of the 
changes in DALY rates of neurological disorders with development were driven by changes in YLLs.
Interpretation Neurological disorders are an important cause of disability and death worldwide. Globally, the burden 
of neurological disorders has increased substantially over the past 25 years because of expanding population numbers 
and ageing, despite substantial decreases in mortality rates from stroke and communicable neurological disorders. 
The number of patients who will need care by clinicians with expertise in neurological conditions will continue to 
grow in coming decades. Policy makers and health-care providers should be aware of these trends to provide adequate 
services.

Introduction
In 2006, WHO emphasised the importance of 
neurological disorders (a group that at the time included 
epilepsy, Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias, 
Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, migraine, stroke, 
poliomyelitis, 
tetanus, 
meningitis, 
and 
Japanese 
encephalitis) for public health,1 and estimated that these 
disorders accounted for 6·3% of the global disability-
adjusted life-years (DALYs). However, the WHO report 
was largely based on the Global Burden of Disease Study 
2000 (GBD 2000)2 and did not reflect understanding of 
the comparative global epidemiology of neurological 
disorders. Increasing life expectancy and population 
growth worldwide in recent years mean that more 
people are now reaching ages where neurological 
disorders are most prevalent. Additionally, there have 
been changes in the treatment of some neurological 
disorders (such as the introduction of acute stroke units,

thrombolysis, and thrombectomy), as well as changes in 
the risk factors that affect the burden of neurological 
disorders in the world.
To improve health-care planning and health outcomes 
of people with neurological disorders, we must 
understand not only the number and distribution of 
people with these disorders between countries, but also 
how these disorders affect population health (in terms of 
both mortality and disability) compared with other 
diseases and injuries.
The Global Burden of Disease Study 2015 (GBD 2015) 
GBD 20153,4 produced comprehensive and comparable 
estimates of the burden (prevalence, deaths, and DALYs) of 
315 diseases and injuries for 195 countries and territories 
from 1990 to 2015. However, aggregated estimates in the 
category of neurological disorders did not include stroke, 
brain and nervous system cancer, or communicable 
neurological disorders, which are of great relevance to 
neurologists. Ischaemic and haemor 
rhagic stroke were 
classified as cardiovascular diseases; brain and nervous 
system cancer as malignant neoplasms; and meningitis, 
encephalitis, and tetanus as communicable diseases. In 
this systematic analysis, we quantify the disease burden 
(as measured by prevalence, mortality, DALYs, and years 
lived with disability [YLDs]) due to neurological disorders 
and its relationship with development level as measured 
by the Socio-demographic Index (SDI; an indicator based 
on lagged-distributed income per person, average 
educational attainment among individuals older than 
15 years, and total fertility rate).
Methods
Categorisation of disorders
In an expanded category of neurological disorders we 
included 
stroke, 
Alzheimer’s 
disease 
and 
other 
dementias, Parkinson’s disease, epilepsy, multiple 
sclerosis, migraine, tension-type headache, medication 
overuse headache, meningitis, tetanus, encephalitis, 
brain and nervous system cancer, motor neuron disease, 
and a residual category of other neurological disorders 
that included diseases such as muscular dystrophy and 
Huntington’s disease (appendix p 112).
Non-fatal estimates
GBD 2015 non-fatal burden estimates were based on a 
systematic review of the literature to obtain all available 
epidemiological data on prevalence, incidence, risk of 
mortality, and severity. In the appendix we provide for 
each neurological disorder analysed the following: the 
list of International Classification of Diseases (ICD) 
codes used for mapping neurological causes of death (pp 
118–21); a list of GBD sequelae, health states, health state 
lay descriptions, and disability weights for neurological 
disorders (pp 122–39); the total number of site-years by 
neurological cause and source type (p140); and the data 
representativeness index for each neurological disorder, 
the percentage of GBD 2015 geographies with any data 
by cause pertaining to the period before 2005, 2005–15, 
and all years of data (p 141). Reference case definitions 
were based on ICD-9 or ICD-10 criteria with the addition 
of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
The Global Burden of Disease Study 2015 (GBD 2015) produced 
comprehensive and comparable estimates of the burden of 
various disorders (prevalence, deaths, and disability-adjusted 
life years [DALYs]) for 195 countries and territories from 1990 
to 2015. However, aggregated estimates in the category of 
neurological disorders did not include data for stroke, brain and 
nervous system cancer, or communicable neurological 
disorders, which are all of great relevance to neurologists. 
Added value of this study
For GBD 2015, the GBD 2013 search strategy was replicated to 
take into account all relevant epidemiological studies published 
between 2013 and 2015. In this systematic analysis, we 
produced estimates of the burden of neurological disorders 
(stroke, Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias, Parkinson’s 
disease, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, migraine and tension-type 
headache, medication overuse headache, meningitis, tetanus, 
encephalitis, brain and nervous system cancers, motor neuron 
disease, and a residual category of other neurological disorders), 
separately and combined. For the first time, we included stroke, 
brain and nervous system cancer, and communicable 
neurological disorders. We quantified the global disease burden 
(as measured by prevalence, mortality, DALYs, years of life lost, 
and years lived with disability) and explored variation in the 
burden by neurological disorder type, age, sex, and overall 
country development level as measured by the Socio-
demographic Index (SDI). The study showed that neurological 
disorders ranked as the leading cause of DALYs in 2015 and the 
second-leading cause of death. The most prevalent neurological 
disorders were headaches (tension-type headache, medication 
overuse headache, and migraine) and Alzheimer’s disease and 
other dementias.
Implications of all the available evidence
Over the past 25 years, the burden of neurological disorders has 
increased substantially, and our expanded list of neurological 
disorders makes this the leading cause group of disability, and 
the second-leading cause group of mortality worldwide. Stroke 
remains the largest contributor to this burden globally. For all 
neurological disorders combined, there was a noticeable (by 
almost five times) gradual decrease in age-standardised DALY 
rates with increasing SDI, but these rates had large geographical 
variations. These findings could help to guide health systems 
and research activities to reduce the burden of neurological 
disorders.

(DSM)-III and DSM-IV criteria for dementia and the 
International Classification of Headache Disorders 
criteria for headaches.5,6 Sources of information used to 
estimate the burden of neurological disorders are on the 
Global Health Data Exchange website.
Detailed GBD methods for calculating non-fatal 
estimates have been reported elsewhere.4 The epidemio-
logical data were analysed with DisMod-MR 2.1,7 a 
Bayesian meta-regression tool that adjusts datapoints for 
variations in study methods between data sources and 
enforces 
consistency 
between 
data 
for 
different 
parameters, such as incidence and prevalence. For each 
neurological disorder, we defined a parsimonious set of 
sequelae that best described different aspects of the 
disabling consequences. Each non-fatal sequela was 
estimated separately. We calculated the YLDs caused by 
the residual category of other neurological disorders 
indirectly using a ratio of YLDs to years of life lost (YLLs). 
We calculated the ratio of YLDs to YLLs for Alzheimer’s 
disease and other dementias, Parkinson’s disease, 
multiple sclerosis, and motor neuron disease, and 
multiplied this ratio by the YLL estimates for other 
neurological disorders. Further details of the non-fatal 
estimates of each of the included neurological disorders 
are in the appendix (pp 5–113).
Disability weights for a set of 235 health states covering 
all sequelae of disease and injury estimated in GBD 2015 
were estimated by pair-wise comparison methods 
presenting pairs of lay health state descriptions to 
respondents in surveys done in the general population in 
nine countries, and an open web-based survey.8 The 
sequelae of the neurological disorders included in this 
analysis each map to a unique health state with a 
corresponding disability weight (appendix pp 122–39). 
YLDs were computed by multiplying the prevalence of 
each sequela by a disability weight and aggregating 
estimates for all sequelae for a disease.
We categorised countries by their overall development 
status level as determined by the SDI, classifying them in 
high, high–medium, medium, medium–low, and low 
SDI quintiles on the basis of values across the 1980–2015 
period (appendix pp 142–46), as described in detail 
elsewhere.9 The average expected relationships between 
DALY rates and death rates from neurological disorders 
(individually and as a group) and SDI over the entire 
study period (1990–2015) across all geographies in males 
and females were estimated using spline regression. We 
also categorised countries into 21 GBD regions (appendix 
p 155).
Causes of death 
GBD 2015 uses a database of 14 236 site-years of vital 
registration, verbal autopsy (a method of determining 
cause of death in countries that have no functional vital 
registration system), and maternal and child death 
surveillance data, covering the period from 1980 to 2015.9 
Trained 
interviewers 
administer 
a 
structured 
questionnaire to relatives of a deceased person about 
their symptoms preceding death. The underlying cause 
of death is inferred by computer algorithms or physician 
review of the autopsy interview. We estimated deaths for 
all neurological disorders apart from headaches, to 
which no deaths are assigned as the underlying cause. 
For each neurological cause except dementia, we used 
the GBD Cause of Death Ensemble model (CODEm) 
strategy.10,11 CODEm applies mixed effects or spatio-
temporal Gaussian process regression models to 
mortality rates or cause fractions in varying com-
binations with predictive covariates. The ensemble of 
models with best credentials on out-of-sample predictive 
validity tests was selected for each cause of death. YLLs 
were calculated by multiplying the number of deaths at 
each age by the standard life expectancy at that age.12 
Results from CODEm for each disease were scaled to fit 
all-cause mortality estimates derived from demographic 
sources by location, age, year, and sex.
We decided to use a natural history model for 
dementia because of a large inconsistency between the 
data for prevalence and mortality. For instance, in the 
USA, the rates of death from dementia increased five 
times between 1990 and 2014, whereas the available 
prevalence and incidence data showed no significant 
changes over the same period. Large increases in death 
rates assigned to dementia have also occurred in some 
other countries with high-quality vital registration 
systems. Furthermore, in GBD 2015, the prevalence of 
dementia varied among 187 countries by a factor of 
three, whereas dementia death rates varied by more 
than 20 times.13 The likely explanation was a change in 
coding practices between countries and within countries 
over time. To correct for this source of measurement 
bias, we assessed the most recent data from 23 high-
income countries with high-quality vital registration 
systems and the highest ratio of registered dementia 
death rates to prevalent cases. This ratio is equivalent to 
the excess rate of mortality in cases of dementia. We 
derived a pooled estimate by age and sex using a linear 
regression of the log of these rates. We added these 
estimates as data in DisMod-MR 2.1 to derive estimates 
of cause-specific mortality rates that were consistent 
with prevalence data and the pooled estimate of excess 
mortality from the 23 countries that in their most recent 
year of vital registration were most willing to code a 
death to dementia as the underlying cause.10 
Compilation of results
DALYs were computed as the sum of YLLs and YLDs for 
each country, age, sex, and year with 95% uncertainty 
intervals (UIs) based on the 25th and 975th values of the 
ordered 1000 draws. Unless explicitly mentioned 
otherwise, all rates were age-standardised using the 
GBD standard.10 This study is compliant with the 
Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health 
Estimates Reporting (GATHER; appendix pp 114–17).14,15

of global deaths. We were unable to report the combined 
prevalence. Classifying stroke under neurological 
disorders rather than cardiovascular diseases made 
neurological disorders the largest cause group of DALYs 
and the second-largest behind cardiovascular diseases in 
terms of global deaths. Among the neurological 
disorders, stroke, migraine, meningitis, Alzheimer’s 
disease and other dementias, and epilepsy each caused 
more than 10 million DALYs. The most prevalent 
neurological disorders were the various types of headache 
and Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias (table 1).
Global burden by sex and age
Substantial sex differences in age-standardised death, 
DALY, and prevalence rates existed globally in 2015. 
The only neurological disorders with less than 
10% difference between males and females were 
Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias in terms of 
death and DALY rates, and meningitis and epilepsy in 
terms of prevalence rate. Apart from multiple sclerosis, 
Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias, and the three 
headache types, DALY and prevalence rates were higher 
in males than females. All these more substantial sex 
differences were significant apart from those for 
meningitis, tetanus, and encephalitis death rates and 
the meningitis and encephalitis DALY rates (appendix 
pp 153–54). The age pattern varied between the various 
neurological disorders. The bulk of burden due to 
communicable neurological disorders occurred in 
young individuals, particularly the 0–5 years age group. 
Epilepsy caused the most burden in children and young 
adults. Headaches peaked at ages 25–49 years, whereas 
the burden of other neurological disorders increased 
with age (figure 1).
Proportional contribution to the combined burden
Stroke accounted for the largest proportion of total 
DALYs (47·3%) and deaths (67·3%) among all 
neurological disorders analysed (figure 2). Migraine, 
meningitis, and Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias 
were the second, third, and fourth largest contributors of 
DALYs. The proportional contributions of the other 
neurological disorders analysed were less substantial and 
varied from 0·4% (for motor neuron disease) to 5·0% 
(epilepsy). The second largest contributor to deaths from 
neurological disorders was Alzheimer’s disease and 
other dementias. The proportional contribution of deaths 
from other neurological disorders varied from 0·2% for 
(multiple sclerosis) to 4·0% (for meningitis; figure 2).
Geographical variations in the burden
In 2015, the lowest age-standardised DALY rates (less 
than 3000 per 100 000 people) and death rates (less than 
100 per 100 000 people) from neurological disorders were 
estimated for high-income regions and Latin America, 
whereas the highest DALY rates (more than 7000 per 
100 000 people) were estimated for Afghanistan, Central 
African Republic, Guinea-Bissau, Kiribati, and Somalia. 
The highest death rates (more than 280 per 100 000 people)

among the top three causes in all regions except 
Oceania, south Asia, and the four sub-Saharan African 
regions, where epilepsy or meningitis ranked higher. 
Communicable neurological conditions ranked low in 
high-income regions and central Europe. Epilepsy and 
medication overuse headache ranked fourth, fifth, or 
sixth in almost all regions (figure 4).
A more detailed breakdown of geographical variation 
is shown as maps of age-standardised prevalence, death 
rates, and DALY rates for each neurological disorder 
(appendix pp 156–69). The prevalence of stroke was 
highest in eastern Europe, central Asia, Oceania, 
Indonesia, 
Myanmar, 
and 
sub-Saharan 
African 
countries. High death rates in Mongolia, Afghanistan, 
and Central African Republic were responsible for these 
countries also having the highest age-standardised 
DALY rates for stroke. Prevalence, death, and DALY 
rates for Alzheimer’s and other dementias were highest 
in North America and north Africa and the Middle East, 
while the lowest rates were estimated for sub-Saharan 
Africa, southern Latin America, and Australasia. 
Prevalence and DALY rates for Parkinson’s disease were 
highest in high-income regions and lowest in sub-
Saharan Africa and eastern Europe. The strong positive 
relationship with latitude was apparent in the 
distribution of prevalence, death, and DALY rates for 
multiple sclerosis. High death rates due to epilepsy 
were the cause of high DALY rates in sub-Saharan 
Africa. Prevalence of epilepsy was highest in central 
Latin America, Chile, north Africa and the Middle East, 
and Bangladesh. Highest rates of motor neuron disease 
occurred in high-income regions.
The prevalence and DALY rates for the different types 
of headache varied by a factor of three to four between 
countries with the highest rates in high-income regions, 
north Africa and the Middle East, and tropical 
Latin America, while lowest rates were seen in sub-
Saharan Africa and east Asia. Medication overuse 
headache was particularly common in eastern Europe 
and Iran. The highest death and DALY rates for brain 
and nervous system cancers were in central Europe and 
north Africa and the Middle East. Meningitis caused 
most disease burden in sub-Saharan Africa, especially in 
the meningitis belt across the Sahara. The largest burden

from tetanus was estimated for a few countries in east 
Africa, particularly South Sudan and Somalia, which 
have low vaccination coverage owing to national conflict. 
India had the largest burden from encephalitis.
Changes in the burden from 1990 to 2015
Time trends from 1990 to 2015 in prevalence, deaths, and 
DALYs due to neurological disorders varied across the 
disorders studied (table 1). Despite a significant drop in 
age-standardised stroke rates, population increase and 
ageing combined led to increases in absolute numbers of 
the three indicators. There was a large increase in the 
absolute numbers of DALYs, deaths, and prevalent cases 
of Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias even though 
the changes in age-standardised rates were small. For 
Parkinson’s disease, the numbers of DALYs, deaths, and 
prevalent cases increased substantially while increases in 
age-standardised rates were more modest. There was a 
significant decrease in epilepsy death and DALY rates 
while the age-standardised prevalence rate remained 
stable. DALYs, deaths, and prevalent cases of multiple 
sclerosis increased despite decreasing age-standardised 
rates. The absolute numbers of DALYs and prevalent 
cases of motor neuron disease, brain cancer, and 
headaches increased substantially while there was little 
change in age-standardised rates. The largest decreases 
were observed in communicable neurological disorders 
(tetanus, meningitis, and encephalitis). Although the 
rates of DALYs and deaths for all neurological disorders 
combined decreased by more than a quarter from 
1990 to 2015, the absolute number of DALYs and deaths 
from all neurological disorders combined over that 
period increased by 7·4% (from 233·4 million to 
250·7 million) and 36·7% (from 6·9 million to 
9·4 million), respectively.
The decrease in DALY rates from 1990 to 2015 was 
estimated for most countries. The only countries 
with an increase in age-standardised DALY rates were 
the Philippines, Mongolia, Lesotho, Swaziland, and 
Zimbabwe, largely because these countries had an 
increase in DALYs from stroke over the 25-year period. 
The age-standardised DALY rates from neurological 
disorders dropped by more than half in Ethiopia, 
Equatorial Guinea, and South Korea (table 2).
Global burden by SDI
The patterns of disease varied along the development 
spectrum as measured by the SDI (figure 5). Age-
standardised DALY rates of communicable neurological 
disorders were the largest cause of DALYs at low levels 
of SDI. Stroke rates increased from low to middle levels 
of SDI and then decreased to their lowest values at the 
highest level of SDI. The headaches showed little 
change in rates with SDI. Rates of epilepsy gradually 
decreased with rising SDI (figure 5A). However, the all-
age rates of combined neurological disorders increased 
from middle range to highest SDI values, particularly in 
females (figure 5B). Most of the changes in DALY rates 
of neurological disorders with development were driven 
by changes in YLLs. By comparison, the burden due to 
YLDs showed less variation over the range of SDI 
(figure 5C).

On the basis of SDI, Oceania, east and southeast Asia, 
eastern and central Europe, and central Asia had higher 
than expected age-standardised DALY rates for stroke 
for males over the entire estimation period. In females, 
the stroke DALY rates followed the same pattern but 
crossed the expected line in a few years of estimation. In 
females, the stroke DALY rates were initially higher 
than expected on the basis of SDI but fell to below 
expected levels during the study period. Latin America, 
apart from tropical Latin America in the 1990s, eastern 
and western sub-Saharan Africa, western Europe, 
Australasia, and high-income North America had lower 
DALY rates than expected based on SDI (appendix p 
170). North Africa and the Middle East had higher than 
expected DALY rates for Alzheimer’s disease and other 
dementias for males and females. Females in central 
sub-Saharan Africa, high-income North America, and 
tropical Latin America had DALY rates close to expected 
for their SDI values, while all other regions had much 
lower than expected rates (appendix p 171). Migraine 
DALY rates in males in south Asia were furthest above 
the expected line based on SDI. In females, migraine 
DALY rates in tropical Latin America, south Asia, 
Australasia, western Europe, and high-income North 
America were higher than expected. East Asia had much 
lower DALY rates of migraine than expected in males 
and females (appendix p 172). Epilepsy DALY rates were 
higher than expected in eastern, southern, and central 
sub-Saharan Africa and central Asia. Epilepsy rates were 
a bit lower than expected in Oceania and east Asia. The 
DALY rates for meningitis were higher than expected 
based on SDI in western sub-Saharan Africa. All other 
regions closely followed the expected pattern (appendix 
p 173). Plots of regional age-standardised DALY rates 
and SDI for the remaining neurological disorders are in 
the appendix (pp 174–83).
Discussion
Neurological disorders including stroke, communicable 
neurological diseases, and brain cancer accounted for 
10·2% of global DALYs and 16·8% of all deaths in 2015. 
DALYs from all neurological disorders combined exceeded 
those from all injuries (249·8 million), cardiovascular 
disease (228·9 million, excluding stroke), cancer 
(209·4 million), and mental and substance use disorders 
(162·4 million).3 Our study provides a comprehensive 
assessment of the extent, patterns, and trends of DALYs 
for the combined neurological disorders at global, 
regional, and national levels for 195 countries and 
territories with important implications for health policy, 
including priority-setting and financing of health services.
Despite an overall decrease in the age-standardised 
rates of DALYs, death, and YLDs of all neurological 
disorders combined between 1990 and 2015, the number 
of people dying from and affected by these disorders has 
increased substantially, contributing to higher health 
loss across the lifespan. Parkinson’s disease was the only 
neurological disorder with increasing age-standardised 
rates of deaths, prevalence, and DALYs between 1990 
and 2015. Although the burden of communicable 
neurological disorders has significantly decreased over 
this period, the burden of non-communicable neuro-
logical disorders has significantly increased. This finding 
is consistent with the overall global burden shift from 
communicable to non-communicable disorders.16 In 
terms of absolute number of people affected by 
neurological disorders, most of the increase in the 
burden was associated with ageing of the population and 
population growth.9 Increasing incidence of stroke in 
low-income and middle-income countries,17 increasing 
prevalence of multiple sclerosis,18,19 increasing incidence 
of epilepsy in elderly people,20 increasing prevalence of 
tension-type headache,21 and increasing incidence of

brain tumours in elderly people22 have been reported 
elsewhere. Findings from other studies have reported 
that it is difficult to assess trends in prevalence and 
incidence of Parkinson’s disease because of changes in 
case definitions over time.23,24 The evidence on secular 
trends in prevalence of migraine is mixed.21,25
The conclusions from a systematic review26 of similar 
studies over time to examine trends in prevalence, 
incidence, and mortality for people with dementia were 
that there is some evidence that the incidence of 
dementia might be declining in high-income countries, 
but evidence on trends in the prevalence of dementia is 
inconsistent. Our study showed a modest increase in 
the prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease and other 
dementias in high-income North America, high-income 
Asia Pacific, east Asia, south Asia, the Caribbean, and

southern sub-Saharan Africa, and a modest decrease 
elsewhere. The small increase in the global age-
standardised prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease and 
other dementias is in contrast with a significant 
reduction from 1990 to 2015 in the prevalence of stroke, 
despite stroke sharing risks with, and contributing to, 
vascular dementia. For stroke, blood pressure control 
and 
smoking 
cessation 
have 
been 
important 
contributors to the reduction of its incidence in high-
income and middle-income countries.27–29 Diverging 
trends of stroke and dementia incidence rates have been 
reported elsewhere.30 However, the most striking change 
has been the more than doubling of people in the world 
who die or are disabled from Alzheimer’s disease and 
other dementias over the past 25 years. As ageing of the 
global population continues, our findings have 
important major health-service implications for the care 
of patients and adequate support for affected families.
Vaccinations have contributed to the favourable trends 
in the DALY rates of tetanus, meningitis, and 
encephalitis.31–37 Our estimate of 23·4 million cases of 
active epilepsy in 2015 is lower than the 32·7 million 
cases estimated in a meta-analysis of 65 prevalence 
studies, although that study did not specify a year of 
estimate.38 Similar to findings from this meta-analysis, 
we noted large geographical variations in the prevalence 
of epilepsy, with significantly greater rates in low-income 
and middle-income countries. The high prevalence of 
epilepsy in low-income and middle-income countries 
can partly be accounted for by the greater number of 
cases with communicable causes in these countries.38,39 
Our 2015 prevalence estimates are within the ranges 
reported for Parkinson’s disease (51–177 per 100 000 
people),40 motor neuron disease (1·9–3·9 per 100 000 
people),41,42 
tension-type 
headache 
(21–27%),43,44 
medication overuse headache (0·5%–7·2%),45 and 
migraine (mean estimate 10%, range 1–25),46 but lower 
than that reported for multiple sclerosis (65–74 per 
100 000 people),47 dementias (4·2–8·0% in people aged 
60 years or older),48 and stroke (0·4–2·1% in low-income 
and middle-income countries).49 Differences in study 
populations (eg, age range and countries included) might 
account for some of the observed differences in 
prevalence rates.
Between countries, age-standardised rates of DALYs 
and deaths from neurological disorders as a group varied 
up to six times, with the highest rates in low-income to 
middle-income countries. These geographical patterns of 
the burden and distribution of individual neurological 
disorders are important for global and regional health-
care planning and might inform further research to 
examine possible causes of the diseases. For example, 
the clear latitudinal gradient we noted in the prevalence 
of multiple sclerosis (about two times higher prevalence 
in countries at highest latitudes compared with those on 
the equator) corresponds to that observed in other 
studies50,51 and is suggestive of the role of environmental 
factors (eg, vitamin D deficiency and infection).52,53
Our findings of large geographical variations in the 
burden of stroke, dementias, Parkinson’s disease, 
epilepsy, migraine, medication overuse headache, motor 
neuron disease, and brain and nervous system cancers 
concur with previous observations.17,24,26,38,45,46,48,54–58 In non-
communicable neurological disorders, the largest (greater 
than 20 times) variations in age-standardised DALYs were 
observed for stroke, motor neuron disease, and multiple 
sclerosis; in communicable neurological disorders, 
geographical differences ranged from 100 times for 
encephalitis to 10 000 times for tetanus. The greater 
geographical variation of communicable disorders was 
related to their overwhelming predominance in countries 
at low levels of socio-demographic development and 
emphasised the need for better prevention (including 
vaccination and sanitation measures), as well as better 
case management in these regions.
We noted significant sex differences in the burden of 
many neurological disorders analysed (higher prevalence 
of tetanus, stroke, Parkinson’s disease, and motor neuron 
disease, but lower prevalence of multiple sclerosis and 
various types of headaches in males). The greater 
prevalence of stroke,59 Parkinson’s disease,24 epilepsy,60 
and motor neuron disease61 in males has also been

reported by other studies. A greater prevalence in females 
has been reported elsewhere for migraine62 and multiple 
sclerosis.50 Our finding of 22% higher age-standardised 
prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias 
in women is in accordance with a finding from a meta-
analysis of consistently higher estimates among 
160 studies, although it was reported not to be 
significant.48 The higher age-standardised rate might be 
partly due to having a top age category of 80 years and 
older. As dementia is so highly prevalent at oldest ages, 
greater age detail in estimation of dementia prevalence 
might reduce the observed sex difference.
Our study findings have important health service 
implications. The large and increasing numbers of 
patients with neurological disorders necessitate careful 
planning by governments and other health-care providers 
to ensure adequate funding and staff for their treatment 
and rehabilitation services. However, a recent WHO–
World Federation of Neurology survey63 of services and 
other 
resources 
for 
neurological 
disorders 
in 
109 countries (90% of the world population) showed that 
there are large inequalities in access to neurological care 
across different populations, in particular for those living 
in low-income to middle-income countries. With a 
global shortage of neurologists, neuro 
surgeons, and 
rehabilitation professionals, improving neurological care 
will require innovative strategies within existing health 
systems. A good example of such innovative strategies is 
the use of nurses, nurse practitioners, and physician 
assistants trained in stroke care to care for patients with 
acute stroke and transient ischaemic attack in stroke 
units. A recently suggested implementation cycle for 
combating cardiovascular disease in low-income to 
middle-income countries64 provides a good template for 
similar interventional strategies for reducing the burden 
of neuro 
logical disorders in such countries. Although 
improving care and rehabilitation of people with 
neurological disorders is important for improving 
outcomes, there also are effective primary prevention 
strategies for communicable neurological disorders and 
stroke. However, proven effective preventive strategies 
are often underutilised.65,66 More quality epidemiological 
research on risk factors, incidence, prevalence, and 
outcomes of neurological disorders in various countries 
is required to guide better prevention and management 
of these disorders, and our findings could help to 
prioritise such efforts. The sex, age, and regional and 
national differences and trends in the burden of 
neurological disorders necessitate the development, 
implementation, and prioritisation of treatments and

preventive interventions that are specific for sex, age, and 
population to reduce the burden from these disorders.
Although ours was the most up-to-date overview of the 
global burden of major neurological disorders, this study 
was not free from some limitations in addition to overall 
GBD limitations.3,4 First, we assumed that the excess 
mortality in Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias 
implied by prevalence and mortality rates in countries 
that were most willing to code deaths to dementia in 
their vital registrations would apply to all other countries 
and periods. Although we realised that excess mortality 
was unlikely to be generalisable over location and time, 
we chose to make this assumption to address the much 
larger change we observed in deaths certified as 
Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias between 
countries and over time than seen in prevalence or 
incidence studies. Second, estimates of cause-specific 
death rates in most low-income and middle-income 
countries rely on verbal autopsy data rather than 
physician-certified 
death 
records. 
Verbal 
autopsy 
instruments can identify deaths due to some neurological 
disorders, including stroke, meningitis, tetanus, and 
epilepsy, but are unable to capture other neurological 
disorders.67 Third, there are also many gaps in data 
availability by world region, and many low-income and 
middle-income regions do not have any epidemiological 
data. Epilepsy is the only neurological disorder with data 
sources for all 21 GBD regions. Fourth, heterogeneity in 
study methods and case definitions complicates the non-
fatal estimation. Although we endeavoured to adjust for 
such 
methodological 
differences, 
this 
relied 
on 
generalising adjustment factors from few studies. Fifth, 
some categories of neurological disease were not 
included in this analysis because of an inability to 
aggregate cause-level and sequela-level data. For this 
reason, we were unable to include secondary epilepsy, 
the long-term neurological consequences of neonatal 
disorders, or traumatic brain injury and spinal cord 
injury, which are estimated in GBD as sequelae of 
injuries such as falls or road injuries. Adding currently 
missed neurological disorders would increase the health 
significance of the neurological disorders for public 
health systems and should be possible in a future GBD 
iteration. Sixth, sparse data on the severity of these 
neurological diseases did not allow us to differentiate 
severity by location or over time, with the exception of 
epilepsy (appendix pp 5–113). Relying on few studies, 
often from high-income countries only, meant we were 
unable to quantify any treatment effects on severity.
In conclusion, we have shown that neurological 
disorders are a large cause of disability and death 
worldwide. Globally, the burden of neurological disorders 
has increased substantially over the past 25 years because 
of population ageing, despite substantial decreases in 
mortality 
rates 
from 
stroke 
and 
communicable 
neurological disorders. Because low-income and middle-
income countries still have a long way to go through the 
demographic transition of reductions in child mortality 
and population ageing, the number of patients who will 
need neurological care will continue to grow in the 
coming decades. It is important that policy makers and 
health-care providers are aware of these past trends to be 
able to provide adequate services for the growing 
numbers of patients with neurological disorders.
