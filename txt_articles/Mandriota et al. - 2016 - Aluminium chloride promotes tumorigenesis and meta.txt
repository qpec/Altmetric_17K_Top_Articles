Aluminium salts, present in many industrial products of frequent use like antiperspirants, anti-acid drugs, food additives and
vaccines, have been incriminated in contributing to the rise in breast cancer incidence in Western societies. However, current
experimental evidence supporting this hypothesis is limited. For example, no experimental evidence that aluminium promotes
tumorigenesis in cultured mammary epithelial cells exists. We report here that long-term exposure to concentrations of alu-
minium—in the form of aluminium chloride (AlCl3)—in the range of those measured in the human breast, transform normal
murine mammary gland (NMuMG) epithelial cells in vitro as revealed by the soft agar assay. Subcutaneous injections into
three different mouse strains with decreasing immunodeficiency, namely, NOD SCID gamma (NSG), NOD SCID or nude mice,
revealed that untreated NMuMG cells form tumors and metastasize, to a limited extent, in the highly immunodeficient and
natural killer (NK) cell deficient NSG strain, but not in the less permissive and NK cell competent NOD SCID or nude strains. In
contrast, NMuMG cells transformed in vitro by AlCl3 form large tumors and metastasize in all three mouse models. These
effects correlate with a mutagenic activity of AlCl3. Our findings demonstrate for the first time that concentrations of
aluminium in the range of those measured in the human breast fully transform cultured mammary epithelial cells, thus
enabling them to form tumors and metastasize in well-established mouse cancer models. Our observations provide
experimental evidence that aluminium salts could be environmental breast carcinogens.
Aluminium, the most abundant metal in the Earth’s crust, has
no recognized role in biological systems. Due to its versatile
chemistry, aluminium is included in a variety of industrial
products of daily use including food additives, anti-acid drugs,
household products, vaccines and cosmetics.1
Aluminium is generally assumed to be safe, but the bio-
logical consequences of its interaction with biological systems
are largely unknown. Whereas its neurotoxic potential is gen-
erally acknowledged, little data exist on the effects of alumin-
ium on the biology of mammalian cells. Aluminium has been
reported to interfere with the binding of estradiol to estrogen
receptor and to enhance transcription from an estrogen-
responsive element in a reporter system.2,3 A genotoxic effect
of aluminium has been reported in several systems, including
human peripheral blood lymphocytes4,5 (references therein).
Aluminium salts, contained in antiperspirants at concentra-
tions up to several molar units (http://www.fda.gov/Regulatory
Information/Dockets/ucm130350.htm), have been hypothesized
to reach the mammary epithelium at significant doses as a con-
sequence of daily application to the skin of the underarm, thus

 resulting in a continuous exposure. Consistent with this view,
aluminium is adsorbed through the human and mouse skin,6–9
and significant amounts of this metal have been measured in
several compartments of the human breast including breast tis-
sue, nipple aspirate fluid, breast cysts fluids and milk.10–12
In these studies, aluminium concentrations were higher in
the external part of the mammary gland in the normal breast.
Also, they were higher in breast cancer cases than in controls.
These observations have led to the hypothesis that alumini-
um from antiperspirant use might contribute to the increased
incidence of breast cancer observed in the western societies
in the last few decades. In addition to increased incidence, a
change in the topological distribution of breast cancers has
also been reported, the majority of tumours arising nowadays
in the external part of the mammary gland. It has been pro-
posed that the latter change might be due to the application
of an unidentified environmental carcinogen to the underarm
area, with aluminium being a potential candidate.2,13
Due to widespread use of aluminium in antiperspirants,
performing retrospective epidemiological studies on patients
using versus patients non-using aluminium salts as an anti-
perspirant is difficult. Therefore, the considerations on the
carcinogenic potential of aluminium on the human breast
have remained largely speculative in the clinics to date.
On the experimental front, existing studies have focused on
the effects of aluminium on cultured mammary epithelial cells.
We reported that concentrations of aluminium in the range of
those measured in the human breast selectively transform
MCF-10A human mammary epithelial cells in vitro after sever-
al weeks of culture. This effect was preceded by the induction of
DNA double strand breaks, whose repair is often intrinsically
mutagenic, and was not reversible following aluminium with-
drawal from the culture medium, thus suggesting a genetic
modification of the cells. Aluminium was not detectably muta-
genic in bacteria.14 In another study, aluminium increased the
migratory and invasive properties of MCF-7 or MDA-MB-231
human breast cancer cells in vitro.15,16
A harmless compound is not expected to have such
profound effects on the behavior of cultured cells at concen-
trations in the range of those measured in the organism.
Experimental evidence in an animal model, however, would
considerably strengthen the doubts on the safety of alumini-
um originating from these observations.
Due to the known difficulty of growing human cells in
mouse models, we investigated the capacity of normal murine
mammary gland (NMuMG) epithelial cells cultured in the
presence of concentrations of aluminium in the range of
those measured in the human breast to form tumors in well-
established mouse models of cancer. Like MCF-10A cells,
NMuMG cells are spontaneously immortalized and do not
form malignant lesions in nude mice or in the mouse strain
they were originally isolated from (NAMRU).17,18
Material and Methods
Cell culture
NMuMG cells17,18 were kindly provided by Prof. R. Montesano
(University of Geneva) or purchased from LGC Standards/
ATCC (Molsheim Cedex, France) (cat. no. CRL-1636) and used
immediately in the experiments reported in this manuscript.
The cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium
(Sigma-Aldrich, Buchs, Switzerland) (cat. no. D5796) supple-
mented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Amimed/
Bioconcept, Allschwil, Switzerland; cat. no. 2-01F10-I), 100
units/ml penicillin and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich,
cat. no. P0781). Aluminium chloride hexahydrate (Sigma-
Aldrich, cat. no. 06232) was dissolved in Milli-Q H2O at the con-
centration of 1M and immediately diluted at the intermediate
concentrations of 100 mM, 30 mM or 10 mM in Milli-Q H2O.
These stocks were stored at 48C until used. The stocks, or Milli-
Q H2O as a control, were diluted 1:1,000 in fresh culture medi-
um twice a week, at the time the medium was added to the cells.
Under standard culture conditions, NMuMG cells retained
the rounded cobblestone-like growth pattern typical of the
original cell line throughout the time period required to
perform the experiments reported in this study. NMuMG
cells transformed by AlCl3 were the only transformed mouse
cell line present in our laboratory.
Western blotting
Approximately 80% confluent (E-cadherin) or 50% confluent
(N-cadherin) NMuMG cells cultured for 6 months in the pres-
ence of AlCl3 100 lM, or of the same dilution—1/1,000—of sol-
vent (H2O) alone as a control, were lysed in RIPA buffer (Sigma-
Aldrich, cat. no. R0278) supplemented with proteinase inhibitors
(Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no. P8340) and analysed by Western Blot-
ting, using standard procedures. Antibodies (E-cadherin: cat. no.
ab76055; N-cadherin: cat. no. ab76011; b-actin: cat. no. ab6276;
all from Abcam, Cambridge, UK) were used according to manu-
facturer’s instructions. First antibody/horseradish peroxidase-
conjugate second antibody complexes were revealed with Super-
SignalTM West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermofisher
cat. no. 34080) in a myECL imager (Thermofisher). Bands were

 quantified using myImageAnalysis version 2.01 (Thermofisher)
and normalized with respect to b-actin levels.
Soft agar assay
Cells were resuspended in agarose gels at the density of 2 3 104
cells/ml and grown for 14 days in the presence of complete
culture medium as described.19 AlCl3 was not added to the soft
agar assays.
Xenografts
In all the xenograft experiments described, 5 3 106 PBS-washed
cells were resuspended in 200 ll of growth factor reduced Matri-
gel (BD Biosciences, Allschwil, Switzerland; cat. no. 354230) at
the final concentration of 6.5–7.0 mg/ml (depending on the spe-
cific lot used) and injected subcutaneously into one flank of
6-week-old female mice of the indicated strain. Except where
indicated, five mice/condition were used. Mice were purchased
from Charles River Laboratories (Saint-Germain-sur-l’Arbresle,
France) and maintained in a specific pathogen free area.
Experiments were performed according to Institutional ethics
guidelines. For the NOD SCID gamma (NSG) experiment, the
indicated organs were embedded in paraffin using standard pro-
cedures. Two hundreds 5 lm-thick consecutive sections were
cut. Of these, one in every ten was stained with Hematoxylin-
eosin (HE). For the Swiss nude experiment, the procedure was
the same, except that 100 5 lm-thick consecutive sections were
cut, and one every ten was stained with HE. HE stained sections
were screened for metastasis with the help of an expert patholo-
gist. Immunohistochemistry for cytokeratin 7 or 19 used anti-
bodies ab181598 or ab133496, respectively (both from Abcam,
Cambridge, UK), and was performed according to manufac-
turer’s instructions.
Whole-exome sequencing of NMuMG cells
Whole-exome sequencing was conducted on NMuMG cells
cultured for 7 months in the presence of AlCl3 100 lM or
the same dilution of solvent (H2O) alone as a control. Librar-
ies were prepared with the Agilent SureSelect Target Enrich-
ment technology. Next generation sequencing was performed
on an Illumina Hiseq 2500 using paired-end 100 bp run. The
variants identified were filtered through the “spin-off” tool
specific for somatic cancer mutations, MuTect (https://www.
broadinstitute.org/cancer/cga/mutect). The indicated muta-
tions were verified by PCR followed by Sanger sequencing,
using standard procedures.
Results
NMuMG cells were routinely cultured in the presence of
AlCl3 100 lM, or of the same dilution—1/1,000—of solvent
(H2O) alone as a control. AlCl3 had no immediate effects on
the morphology of NMuMG cells. After 14–16 weeks of con-
tinuous exposure to AlCl3—corresponding approximately to
42 population doublings—however, NMuMG cells acquired a
fibroblastoid morphology and a scattered growth pattern
reminiscent of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a
hallmark of malignant transformation20 (Fig. 1a, bottom).
Control NMuMG cells, in contrast, exhibited the rounded
cobblestone-like growth pattern typical of these cells (Fig. 1a,
top). Decrease of E-cadherin and increase of N-cadherin
expression are two well-established markers of EMT.20 West-
ern Blotting revealed, on average, a 63% decrease in E-
cadherin and a 3.7-fold increase in N-cadherin expression in
NMuMG cells incubated in the presence of AlCl3, compared
to controls (Figs. 1b and 1c). In the soft agar assay, a well-
characterized method to assess cellular transformation in vitro,
AlCl3-treated NMuMG cells formed larger colonies compared
to controls (Figs. 2a and 2b). NMuMG cells from another
source (ATCC) gave similar results in the soft agar assay (Fig.
2c). These findings confirm and extend the results we obtained
with MCF-10A human mammary epithelial cells.14
As a next step, we wished to determine if NMuMG cells
cultured in the presence of AlCl3 form tumors in mice. The
NAMRU mouse strain being no longer available, we used
three mouse models having different degrees of immunodefi-
ciency. For these experiments, we selected NMuMG cells
grown in the presence of 100 lM AlCl3, as they exhibit the
most marked signs of cellular transformation in vitro (Figs.
1a and 2). NMuMG cells grown in parallel in the presence of
the same dilution of H2O were used as controls.
For the first experiment, we used the NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid
Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ strain, commonly referred to as NOD SCID
gamma (NSG). NSG mice lack mature T cells, B cells, and
functional natural killer (NK) cells, and are deficient in cyto-
kine signaling, leading to successful engraftment of normal
and transformed cell types. In the NSG strain, both NMuMG
cells cultured in the presence of AlCl3 100 lM and their cor-
responding controls formed palpable tumors at the site of
injection. However, tumors formed by AlCl3-treated cells
were significantly larger (Fig. 3a).
One week before sacrifice—that is, 5 weeks after injection—
mice injected with AlCl3-treated cells had lost weight and
looked sick. They became progressively unable to move around
and to eat. In contrast, mice injected with control cells retained
normal weight and exhibited the usual behavior of healthy ani-
mals. At the time of sacrifice, mice injected with control cells
weighted 24.9 6 0.4 (mean 6 SEM) g, whereas mice injected
with AlCl3-treated cells weighted 20.6 6 1.3 (mean 6 SEM) g
(Fig. 3b).
At the time of dissection, the lightest mouse injected with
AlCl3-treated cells had massive, macroscopically visible metas-
tasis in the lungs (Fig. 3c, right; Fig. 4b). This mouse also had
liver and brain metastasis (Supporting Information Fig. S1
and data not shown). Of the four remaining mice injected
with AlCl3 –treated NMuMG cells, all had massive metastasis
in the lungs. These frequently presented with a central area of
necrosis (Fig. 4b). One of the remaining four mice injected
with AlCl3—treated NMuMG cells also had metastasis in the
cerebellum (Fig. 5). Like the tumors grown at the site of injec-
tion, metastases were labeled by the epithelial markers cyto-
keratin 7 and 19 (Supporting Information Fig. S1, 5 and data

 not shown). In mice injected with control cells, only lung
metastases were observed (Fig. 4a). These were smaller and
less numerous than in mice injected with AlCl3-treated
NMuMG cells. By counting metastases in the lungs of either
groups on randomly selected HE stained sections, we found
2.4 6 0.9 (mean 6 SEM) metastasis/45 mm2 in the group
injected with control NMuMG cells, and 11.8 6 2.0 (mean 6
SEM) metastasis/45 mm2 in the group injected with AlCl3-
treated NMuMG cells (p 5 0.003, two-tailed t test; n 5 5
mice/group). HE staining found no metastases in the heart,
spleen or kidneys of the two experimental groups.
As a next step, we injected AlCl3-treated NMuMG cells,
or their untreated counterparts, in the NOD.CB17-Prkdcscid/J
mouse strain (commonly referred to as NOD SCID). This
strain is characterized by an absence of functional T cells and
B cells, lymphopenia, hypogammaglobulinemia and a normal
hematopoietic microenvironment. In contrast to NSG mice,
NOD SCID mice have NK cells.
In the NOD SCID strain, AlCl3-treated NMuMG cells
formed palpable tumors with a kinetics similar to that
observed in the NSG strain. In contrast to NSG mice, howev-
er, control NMuMG cells did not grow beyond the volume of
injection during the same period of time (Fig. 6a). At the
time of sacrifice, the general health status of the animals was
similar in the two experimental groups. Also, the weight of
the mice was not significantly different between the two
groups (mice injected with AlCl3-treated NMuMG cells
weighted 23.4 6 1.0 (mean 6 SEM) g, whereas mice injected

in the lungs of mice injected with AlCl3-treated cells, but not
in the lungs of mice injected with control NMuMG cells
(data not shown).
As a next step, AlCl3-treated NMuMG cells, or their cor-
responding controls, were injected subcutaneously into Swiss

 nude mice (Crl:NU-Foxn1nu strain). Of the mouse strains
used in our experiments, this is the less immunodeficient
one. Swiss nude mice are athymic and hairless as a result of
the recessive nu mutation. T cell precursors exist but devel-
opment is blocked in the absence of a thymus. In contrast,
they have normal B cells and normal numbers and functions
of macrophages, NK cells and antigen presenting cells.
In Swiss nude mice, AlCl3-treated NMuMG cells formed
palpable tumors with a kinetics similar to that observed in
NOD SCID mice (Figs. 6a, 6b). In contrast, control NMuMG
cells did not grow beyond the volume of injection during the
same period of time (Fig. 6b). At the time of sacrifice, mouse
weight was similar in the two groups (mice injected with
control cells weighted 24.17 6 1.28 (mean 6 SEM) g whereas

treated NMuMG cells)).
The lungs of 3/5 Swiss nude mice injected with AlCl3-
treated NMuMG cells had metastases as assessed by HE
staining and cytokeratin 19 staining (Fig. 6c). In contrast, 4/4
mice injected with control NMuMG cells did not have lung
metastasis. No metastases were observed in HE stained sec-
tions of the brain, kidneys, spleen, heart or liver of either
groups.
After the initial culture in the presence of AlCl3, AlCl3
was not added to the soft agar or tumor cell xenograft assays,
where NMuMG cells exhibit a proliferative advantage. Simi-
larly, growth in soft agar of MCF-10A cells cultured in the
presence of AlCl3 was not reduced after AlCl3 withdrawal for
5 weeks.14 This suggests that the growth advantage observed
in mammary epithelial cells cultured in the presence of AlCl3
could be due to mutations induced by AlCl3. We previously
reported that AlCl3 induces DNA double strand breaks, a
common source of mutation, in cultured mammary epithelial
cells.14 To explore the possibility that AlCl3 had induced
mutations in NMuMG cells, whole-exome sequencing was
conducted on AlCl3-treated NMuMG cells or NMuMG cells
grown in parallel in the presence of the same dilution of sol-
vent (H2O) alone as a control.
We found 48 mutations affecting 43 genes in AlCl3-
treated versus control NMuMG cells (Supporting Information
Table S1). Direct sequencing on 18 such mutations was suc-
cessful in 14 cases and confirmed the mutation in 13 cases
(92.8%; Supporting Information Table S1) consistent with the
very low false positive rate of MuTect (https://www.broadin-
stitute.org/cancer/cga/mutect). The mutations affect genes
regulating cellular proliferation, migration, metastasis and
apoptosis, including Max-binding protein Mnt21,22 and T-
lymphoma
invasion
and
metastasis-inducing
protein

Although
AlCl3-treated NMuMG cells clearly exhibit a proliferative
advantage in the soft agar and xenograft assays, AlCl3 does
not
increase
proliferation
in
the
conventional,
two-
dimensional culture system used to produce these cells (Sup-
porting Information Fig. S2), thus ruling out the possibility
that the mutations found in AlCl3-treated NMuMG cells are
simply a consequence of increased proliferation.

 Discussion
Although it is generally acknowledged that aluminium is neu-
rotoxic, its widespread distribution in industrial products of
daily use seems to reflect a general belief that, at least when
used at certain concentrations and in certain formulations,
aluminium is innocuous to human health. By several varia-
tions of the Ames test, one of the most common biological
assays used in the industry to assess the mutagenic potential
of chemical compounds, aluminium is not detectably muta-
genic in bacteria.14 Whereas this result might seem reassur-
ing, accumulating experimental evidence on the effects of
aluminium in mammalian systems is opening an unsuspected
scenario.
The results obtained in cultured mammary epithelial cells
are perhaps the most intriguing ones. In the large majority of
commercial antiperspirants, aluminium is present as AlCl3 or,
more frequently, as aluminium chlorohydrate (Al2Cl(OH)5) at
concentrations up to several molar units (see Introduction). In
aqueous solutions at pH 7.0, both salts yield aluminium
hydroxide and they are absorbed through the human and
mouse skin.6–9 It is, therefore, conceivable that the daily appli-
cation of antiperspirants to the skin of the underarm represents
a major source of exposure of the human mammary epithelium
to aluminium. Although aluminium concentrations in the body
are generally low, levels measured in the breast area are signifi-
cantly higher. More specifically, Al concentrations were in the
range of 150–520 lg/l (mean 268.4 6 28.1 lg/l), corresponding
to 5.6–19.3 lM, in nipple aspirate fluids11; in the range of
80–330 lg/l (median 150 lg/l) corresponding to 3.0–12.2 lM,
in type I breast cyst fluids10; or in the range of 4–437 nmol/g
dry weight, corresponding to 0.8–87 nmol/g wet weight in
human breast tissue.12 Assuming that 1 g of tissue has a volume
of 1 ml, then overall concentrations of aluminium in the
human breast are in the range of 0.8–87 lM. It appears relevant
that the reported transforming and invasion promoting effects
of aluminium on cultured mammary epithelial cells14–16 (this
study) occur at aluminium concentrations within o very close
to the range of those measured in the human breast.
Like MCF-10A cells,14 NMuMG cells cultured in the pres-
ence of AlCl3 10–100 lM undergo cellular transformation
in vitro, as assessed by the soft agar assay. Regarding the
xenografts experiments, although in the NSG model both
AlCl3-treated and control NMuMG cells form tumors and
metastasize, tumors formed by AlCl3-treated NMuMG cells
were larger than those formed by control cells. Metastases to
the lungs were fivefold more numerous in mice injected with
AlCl3 treated cells, compared to the lungs of mice injected
with control cells. In addition, in NSG mice, AlCl3-treated
cells metastasized to the brain and the liver, whereas control
cells did not. Therefore, in the three mouse models used,
including nude mice, the most used mouse strain in experi-
mental oncology and drug testing, AlCl3-treated NMuMG
cells are markedly more aggressive than their controls. In
addition, our results demonstrate that continuous exposure of
mammary epithelial cells to aluminium enables them to
evade the immunological barrier represented by NK cells and
the other immune tumor suppressive cells present in NOD
SCID or nude mice, a key step in malignant tumor progression.
These effects are likely to be explained at least in part by the
mutagenic activity of AlCl3, because selection for mutations
that provide a proliferative advantage is a well-recognized
mechanism of malignancy. EMT induced in NMuMG cells by
AlCl3 is also likely to contribute to their invasive phenotype.
Aluminium is not the only metal with carcinogenic properties.
Known examples include certain forms of arsenic, beryllium, chro-
mium, nickel and cadmium. For some of these metals—in particu-
lar arsenic and hexavalent chromium—the carcinogenic effect
seems to rely on their mutagenic potential, although other mecha-
nisms cannot be excluded.24 In the case of aluminium, its trans-
forming effect is preceded by the dose-dependent appearance of

 Figure 6. AlCl3 promotes tumorigenesis and metastasis in NMuMG cells injected subcutaneously into NOD SCID and nude mice. (a) Five
million NMuMG cells cultured for 8 months in the presence of AlCl3 100 lM or the equivalent volume of H2O as control were resuspended
in 200 ll of Matrigel and injected subcutaneously into the flank of 6-week-old NOD SCID female mice. Five mice/condition were used. Cell
growth at the site of injection was measured with a caliper. The graph shows the volume 6 SEM of such growth (calculated according to
the formula V (mm3) 5 d2 (mm2) 3 D (mm)/2, where d and D are the smallest and largest tumor diameters, respectively) at the indicated
number of days after injection. Tumor incidence was 100% (all the mice injected with AlCl3-treated cells formed tumors). p values
(two-tailed t-test) comparing the two experimental groups were as follows: 7 days: p 5 0.37; 13 days: p 5 0.02; 24 days: p 5 0.001; 32, 39
and 45 days: p < 0.001. (b) Five million NMuMG cells cultured for 8 months in the presence of AlCl3 100 lM or the equivalent volume of

Five mice were used for AlCl3-treated cells, and four mice for control cells (the fifth mouse planned to be injected with control cells died
during anesthesia at the time of injection). Cell growth at the site of injection was measured with a caliper. The graph shows the volume 6
SEM of such growth (calculated according to the formula V (mm3) 5 d2 (mm2) 3 D (mm)/2, where d and D are the smallest and largest

AlCl3-treated cells formed tumors). p values comparing the two experimental groups were as follows: 7 days: p 5 0.11; 14 days:
p5 0.0049; 21 days: p5 0.0017; 28 and 35 days: p< 0.003 (two-tailed t-test). (c) HE stained section (left) or cytokeratin 19 immunohistochemistry

 DNA double strand breaks at the same concentrations that trans-
form cells on long-term culture.14 As the repair of DNA double
strand breaks is error-prone, and the transformed phenotype of
MCF-10A cells cultured in the presence of AlCl3 is not reverted by
AlCl3 withdrawal,14 it appears conceivable that the transforming
effect of aluminium relies at least in part on a mutagenic effect.
Consistent with this interpretation, by full exome sequencing we
found several mutations in AlCl3-treated NMuMG cells compared
to controls. These mutations occurred in genes regulating cellular
proliferation, migration, metastasis and apoptosis, Max-binding
protein Mnt21,22 and T-lymphoma invasion and metastasis-
inducing protein 2 (Tiam2)23 being the most interesting mutated
cancer genes in the list presenting with a high PolyPhen-2 score
(Supporting Information Table S1). The actual contribution of
these mutations to the transforming effect of aluminium, if any,
remains to be demonstrated.
Conclusive evidence on the carcinogenic potential of alu-
minium requires epidemiological studies in humans and in
vivo experiments were aluminium is directly applied to the
skin of mice. In addition, it would be interesting to isolate
and grow primary cultures of mouse mammary epithelial
cells in the presence of AlCl3, prior to tumorigenicity assays
in syngenic mice. Whereas these evidences are awaited, the
in vivo observations reported in this study consolidate our
previous in vitro findings14 and provide additional experi-
mental evidence that aluminium salts could be environmental
breast carcinogens.
