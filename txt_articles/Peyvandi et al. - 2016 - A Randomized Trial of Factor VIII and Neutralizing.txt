Background
Invasive candida infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in preterm 
infants. We performed a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
trial of fluconazole for the prevention of fungal colonization and infection in very-low-
birth-weight neonates.
Methods
During a 15-month period, all neonates weighing less than 1500 g at birth from eight 
tertiary Italian neonatal intensive care units (322 infants) were randomly assigned 
to receive either fluconazole (at a dose of either 6 mg or 3 mg per kilogram of body 
weight) or placebo from birth until day 30 of life (day 45 for neonates weighing 
<1000 g at birth). We performed weekly surveillance cultures and systematic fungal 
susceptibility testing.
Results
Among infants receiving fluconazole, fungal colonization occurred in 9.8% in the 
6-mg group and 7.7% in the 3-mg group, as compared with 29.2% in the placebo 
group (P<0.001 for both fluconazole groups vs. the placebo group). The incidence of 
invasive fungal infection was 2.7% in the 6-mg group and 3.8% in the 3-mg group, 
as compared with 13.2% in the placebo group (P 
= 
0.005 for the 6-mg group and 
P 
= 
0.02 for the 3-mg group vs. the placebo group). The use of fluconazole did not 
modify the relationship between colonization and the subsequent development of 
invasive fungal infection. Overall mortality was similar among groups, as was the 
incidence of cholestasis. No evidence for the emergence of resistant candida species 
was observed, but the study did not have substantial power to detect such an effect.
Conclusions
Prophylactic fluconazole reduces the incidence of colonization and invasive candida 
infection in neonates weighing less than 1500 g at birth. The benefit of treating can-
dida colonization is unclear. (Current Controlled Trials number, ISRCTN85753869).

espite efforts to improve the out-
comes of preterm infants, systemic fungal 
diseases caused mainly by candida species 
are an important complication of the care of neo-
nates on the threshold of viability. Candida spe-
cies colonize up to 60% of very-low-birth-weight 
neonates (those weighing less than 1500 g) during 
their first month in the neonatal intensive care 
unit (NICU). Such colonization may progress to 
invasive fungal infection in up to 20% of these 
infants.1-5 Nonspecific clinical features, poor sen-
sitivity of diagnostic tests, and late recognition 
mean that at the time of diagnosis invasive fungal 
infection is often advanced. Such infections in-
crease the rate of death from all causes (28%, vs. 
7% for infants without such infections3) and death 
that is attributable to fungal infection (up to 44% 
of deaths).1-5 Early diagnosis and successful treat-
ment have not been shown to prevent prolonged 
stays in the NICU, high costs, or neurodevelop-
mental impairment.6-8
Very-low-birth-weight neonates are at risk for 
invasive fungal infection because of their imma-
ture immune system and the invasive supportive 
care they require.9-14 Prophylaxis with antifungal 
drugs is established in certain select high-risk 
patients, such as adult and pediatric patients with 
hematologic cancers and immunity defects.15-19 
Among such patients, prophylactic fluconazole 
has decreased candida-related complications.20,21 
After a single-center, randomized trial suggested 
similar efficacy in high-risk, extremely-low-birth-
weight neonates (those with birth weights below 
1000 g),22 some NICUs began using fluconazole 
for routine prophylaxis.23-26 Even so, expert opin-
ion27-30 and Cochrane reviews31,32 do not recom-
mend this practice because of the paucity of data 
regarding safety and resistance and the absence 
of adequately powered, multicenter trials. This 
study presents the results of such a multicenter, 
prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled evaluation of fluconazole prophylaxis 
in very-low-birth-weight infants in the NICU.
Methods
Patients
From May 1, 2004, to July 31, 2005, we enrolled 
neonates at eight tertiary Italian NICUs in the 
study, which was approved by the ethics commit-
tee at each hospital. Parents or guardians pro-
vided written informed consent. Pfizer Italia sup-
ported the study with a grant and supplied both 
fluconazole and placebo; the sponsor was not in-
volved in the study design, in the enrollment of 
patients, or in the collection, analysis, interpreta-
tion of the data or preparation of the manuscript. 
All authors vouch for the completeness and accu-
racy of the data presented.
The primary objective was to evaluate the ef-
fectiveness of fluconazole at doses of 3 mg and 
6 mg per kilogram of body weight in the preven-
tion of candida colonization and infection. Sec-
ondary objectives were assessment of the incidence 
of gram-positive and gram-negative sepsis, necro-
tizing enterocolitis, ligation of patent ductus arte-
riosus, threshold retinopathy of prematurity requir-
ing surgery, severe intraventricular hemorrhage, 
bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and alteration of 
liver function at baseline and at the end of pro-
phylaxis.
Very-low-birth-weight neonates who were ad-
mitted to the NICU before day 3 of life were eli-
gible for enrollment. Exclusion criteria were a lack 
of parental consent and liver failure (levels of 
aspartate aminotransferase and alanine amino-
transferase that were three times the upper limit 
of the range of normal values). The pharmacy at 
each center used computer-generated randomiza-
tion lists to form three groups in a 1:1:1 ratio and 
prepared the daily drug doses. Infants received 
either 6 mg or 3 mg of fluconazole (Diflucan, 
Pfizer Italia) per kilogram of body weight every 
third day for the first 2 weeks and then every 
other day; the placebo group received 1 ml of nor-
mal saline on the same schedule.20,21 Extremely-
low-birth-weight infants received prophylaxis for 
6 weeks; neonates weighing 1000 to 1500 g re-
ceived prophylaxis for 4 weeks,20,21,25 unless they 
were discharged earlier or required systemic anti-
fungal therapy for proven or presumed invasive 
fungal infection. Administration of the study drug 
began on day 3 with one daily dose intravenously, 
if a catheter was present, or through an orogas-
tric tube.
Weekly surveillance of liver function (levels of 
serum aspartate aminotransferase, alanine amino-
transferase, γ-glutamyltransferase, and bilirubin) 
was performed for the duration of administration 
of the study drug. Drug interactions with flucon-

azole were screened. Invasive fungal infection 
was defined as a positive culture from blood (a 
peripheral site), urine (collected by sterile supra-
pubic puncture or bladder catheterization, with 
growth of ≥10,000 organisms per milliliter), or 
cerebrospinal fluid. Diagnosis relied on guide-
lines from international consensus documents33,34 
and recommendations of the Italian Neonatology 
Society’s Fungal Infections Task Force.35 Invasive 
fungal infections were treated with intravenous 
liposomal amphotericin B at the recommended 
doses. Investigators remained unaware of study-
group assignments during such treatment.
Fungal Isolation and Identification
The following cultures were obtained: at baseline 
and then weekly, we performed surveillance cul-
tures of the ear canal (at birth only), stool, gastric 
aspirate, and nasopharynx or endotracheal secre-
tions while infants were receiving fluconazole or 
placebo; cultures were obtained from surgical de-
vices after removal; and clinical cultures were ob-
tained from sites indicated by the physician (e.g., 
skin and respiratory secretions). Baseline coloniza-
tion was defined as the isolation of fungi from the 
ear canal at birth or from any site during days 1 and 
2 of life.
Specimens were incubated on chromogen cul-
ture plates (Albicans ID, BioMérieux) to identify 
Candida albicans colonies as blue stains after 48 
hours at 37°C. Colonies were speciated through a 
miniaturized system of biochemical tests (Vitec 
Yeast, BioMérieux). Isolates were tested for sensitiv-
ity to fluconazole with standardized microbroth 
dilution assays (ATB-Fungus-2-Int, BioMérieux) 
according to recommendations of the National 
Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards 
(NCCLS).36 The interpretative breakpoint of flu-
conazole resistance was defined as at least 64 μg 
per milliliter. A breakpoint of 16 to 32 μg per 
milliliter was considered to be indicative of dose-
responsive susceptibility.36
Statistical Analysis
The following variables were analyzed: incidence 
of colonization (at least one site), invasive fungal 
infection, death from all causes before discharge 
from the hospital, candida-related deaths (death 
within 3 days after the last positive culture from 
any site in the absence of other causes or isolation 
of candida species at autopsy), the presence of 
natively fluconazole-resistant species, secondary 
outcomes (including those potentially related to 
fluconazole), the rate of progression of coloniza-
tion to invasive fungal infection, and patterns of 
the sensitivity of isolates to fluconazole. Infants 
receiving either 6 mg or 3 mg of fluconazole per 
kilogram were compared separately with those re-
ceiving placebo. Since there were no significant 
differences between the 6-mg group and the 3-mg 
group, a post hoc analysis was performed compar-
ing the placebo group with both fluconazole 
groups combined. Proportions and continuous 
variables were compared with the use of Fisher’s 
exact two-tailed test and the t-test, respectively. 
Risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals were 
calculated to compare cumulative between-group 
incidences with the use of Stata software. A multi-
variate logistic-regression analysis was performed 
with adjustment for important risk factors possi-
bly associated with invasive fungal infection. The 
Wald test was used to assess the significance of 
the estimated coefficients.
The number of patients needed for each group 
was estimated in 82 infants for colonization on 
the basis of a two-sided type I error rate of 0.05 
or less and a power of 90% to detect an absolute 
difference of at least 66% (a decrease from 30% 
to 10%) in the cumulative incidence of fungal 
colonization between infants in the fluconazole 
groups and those in the placebo group, given a 
pretrial incidence of 30%. The number needed for 
each group was also estimated in 89 infants for 
invasive fungal infection on the basis of a two-
sided type I error rate of 0.05 or less and a power 
of 80% to detect an absolute difference of at least 
80% (a decrease from 15% to 3%) in the cumula-
tive incidence of invasive fungal infection between 
infants in the fluconazole groups and those in the 
placebo group, given a pretrial incidence of 15%. 
A total of 118 infants would have been needed to 
reach a power of 90%. Given the low incidence of 
invasive fungal infection in the two fluconazole 
groups, the study was underpowered to detect sig-
nificant differences for this outcome between 
these groups. Assuming an incidence of 4% in 
the 3-mg group, 1141 infants would have been 
needed to reach a power of 80% to detect an ab-
solute difference of 50%, and 424 infants would 
have been needed for a difference of 75%. Power

Results
Patients
A total of 363 very-low-birth-weight neonates sur-
vived for at least 3 days and were potentially eligi-
ble for the study. Of these infants, 27 were ineli-
gible owing to liver failure at baseline (3 patients), 
a lack of consent (12 patients), and missing or in-
correct randomization (12 patients). Another 14 
infants were removed from the analysis owing to 
incomplete data (3 in the 6-mg group, 3 in the 
3-mg group, and 4 in the placebo group), incor-
rect drug administration (2 in the 6-mg group and 
1 in the 3-mg group), or accidental administra-
tion of five doses of fluconazole instead of placebo 
(1 in the placebo group). A total of 322 neonates 
were randomly assigned, 112 to the 6-mg group, 
104 to the 3-mg group, and 106 to the placebo 
group (Fig. 1).
Four infants (1.2%) who were incorrectly as-
signed to the 6-mg group by investigators in one 
NICU received a dose of 6 mg per kilogram. 
Analyses that were repeated without the data from 
these infants provided no significant changes in 
the estimates. A total of 32.2% of fluconazole 
doses were administered orally, and 90.1% of in-
fants received both oral and intravenous admin-
istration. There were no intergroup differences in 
the route of administration. Demographic and 
neonatal characteristics and major risk factors for 
fungal infections are listed in Tables 1 and 2. 
There were no significant baseline differences in 
most risk factors for colonization and invasive 
fungal 
infection 
between 
groups. 
However, 
accord-
ing to univariate analysis, the use of corticoste-
roids and oxygen was significantly increased in 
the groups receiving fluconazole, as compared 
with those receiving placebo (for corticosteroids, 
P<0.001 for the 6-mg group and P 
= 
0.02 for the 
3-mg group; for oxygen, P 
= 
0.05 for the 3-mg 
group).
Fungal Colonization and Invasive Fungal 
Infection
Data regarding fungal colonization, invasive fun-
gal infection, and distribution of fungal species 
and colonization sites and infection are shown in 
Tables 3 and 4. Colonization occurred less fre-
quently in the 6-mg group (9.8%) and the 3-mg 
group (7.7%) than in the placebo group (29.2%; 
P<0.001 for both comparisons). Also less frequent 
was invasive fungal infection (2.7% in the 6-mg 
group and 3.8% in the 3-mg group, as compared 
with 13.2% in the placebo group; P 
= 
0.005 and 
P 
= 
0.02, respectively). The 21 episodes of invasive 
fungal infection were caused by C. albicans (16 pa-
tients), C. parapsilosis (2), C. glabrata (2), C. tropicalis 
(1), and C. guilliermondii (1). One neonate was in-
fected with both C. parapsilosis and C. glabrata. Inva-
sive fungal infections occurred in 2 of 7 neonates 
with baseline colonization (28.6%) in the flucona-
zole groups combined and in 4 of 14 neonates 
(28.6%) in the placebo group.
Fluconazole did not have an effect on the as-
sociation between colonization and subsequent 
progression to invasive fungal infection, which 
occurred in 27.3% of infants in the 6-mg group 
and 50.0% in the 3-mg group, as compared with 
45.2% in the placebo group (P 
= 
0.47 and P 
= 
1.0, 
respectively). Excluding the neonates with coloni-
zation at baseline, the adjusted rate of progression

from colonization to invasive fungal infection 
was 33.0% in the fluconazole groups combined 
and 50.0% in the placebo group (P 
= 
0.30). In a 
post hoc comparison of the fluconazole groups 
combined versus the placebo group, prophylaxis 
significantly reduced colonization and invasive 
fungal infection (P<0.001 and P 
= 
0.001, respective-
ly), without modifying the association between 
colonization and subsequent invasive fungal in-
fection (P 
= 
0.77). Fluconazole at either dose de-
creased colonization and invasive fungal infection 
in extremely-low-birth-weight infants and in those 
weighing 1000 to 1500 g (P 
= 
0.001 for coloniza-
tion in both groups; P 
= 
0.02 and P 
= 
0.03 for in-
vasive fungal infection, respectively), as well as in 
neonates weighing 750 to 1500 g (P 
= 
0.007 for 
invasive fungal infection and P<0.001 for coloni-
zation). A nonsignificant decrease in invasive fun-
gal infection was observed in infants weighing less 
than 750 g (16.7% vs. 2.2%, P 
= 
0.07), as well as 
in those weighing 750 to 1000 g (12.0% vs. 3.7%, 
P 
= 
0.17). However, our study was underpowered 
for a cluster analysis of these two subgroups.
Mortality
Overall mortality was similar in the three groups 
(8.0% in the 6-mg group [P 
= 
0.81] and 8.7% in 
the 3-mg group [P 
= 
1.0], as compared with 9.4% 
in the placebo group). In the fluconazole groups, 
no deaths were attributable to candida infection, 
as compared with two deaths (1.9%) in the place-
bo group (P 
= 
0.23 for the 6-mg group and P 
= 
0.50 
for the 3-mg group) (Table 3).
Isolates Natively Resistant to Fluconazole
There were no significant between-group differ-
ences in the incidence of colonization and infec-
tion with C. krusei, C. glabrata, and C. guilliermondii. 
Overall, three isolates from these species were 
seen in both of the fluconazole groups (C. krusei, 
C. glabrata, and C. guilliermondii) and two in the pla-
cebo group (both C. glabrata). C. glabrata caused two

nonfatal invasive fungal infections, one each in 
the 6-mg group and the placebo group.
Minimal Inhibitory Concentration
Sensitivity to fluconazole as measured by the min-
imal inhibitory concentration (MIC) required to 
inhibit the growth of 90% of the isolates (MIC90) 
did not vary during the study period, and all iso-
lates remained sensitive to fluconazole (C. albicans, 
0.125 to 2.0; and C. parapsilosis, 0.25 to 2.0). MICs of 
fluconazole in the isolated strains did not increase 
in any of the neonates at any center during the 
study period. Satisfactory sensitivity (MIC90: 1 [col-
onizing isolates], 2.0 and 8 [infecting isolates]) 
continued for C. glabrata. All infecting and colo-
nizing isolates were sensitive to amphotericin B 
and flucytosine (MIC90, 0.125 to 1.0 and 0.125 to 
0.25, respectively).
Secondary Outcomes
There were no significant differences in secondary 
outcomes (Table 5). No serious adverse events or 
fluconazole-related toxic effects were recorded. 
Drug administration was not discontinued be-
cause of presumed adverse events, intolerance, or 
potentially dangerous interactions with other 
drugs. At 4 weeks of age, infants who received 
fluconazole had increased levels of aspartate 
aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase. 
For aspartate aminotransferase, the mean (±SD) 
levels were 16.8±11.0 U per liter in the flucon-
azole groups combined and 13.1±10.0 U per liter 
in the placebo group (P 
= 
0.004); for alanine amino-
transferase, the mean levels were 22.8±16.0 U per 
liter in the fluconazole groups combined and 
19.5±11.0 U per liter in the placebo group (P 
= 
0.06). 
These modifications were not observed at 6 weeks 
or at hospital discharge. Elevations in levels of 
more than two times the range of normal in serum 
aspartate aminotransferase and alanine amino-
transferase were recorded in 4 neonates who re-
ceived fluconazole and in no neonates in the 
placebo group (P 
= 
0.31 for both comparisons); 
such increases in γ-glutamyltransferase levels oc-
curred in 13 neonates who received fluconazole 
and in 6 who received placebo (P 
= 
1.0). At 6 weeks 
of age, three infants in the fluconazole groups

tained serum levels that were slightly above nor-
mal (one for aspartate aminotransferase and two 
for γ-glutamyltransferase), as compared with two 
infants (both for γ-glutamyltransferase) in the pla-
cebo group. These abnormalities were transient 
and absent at discharge. No infants reached lev-
els of more than three times the normal range of 
values or had clinical signs of hepatotoxicity or 
cholestasis, and none required treatment for 
cholestasis. None of the neonates required photo-
therapy to treat hyperbilirubinemia.
Discussion
This prospective, randomized, multicenter study 
showed that prophylactic fluconazole prevents 
colonization and infection by candida species in 
very-low-birth-weight infants. Our findings are 
similar to those from single-NICU studies21-26 
and to those observed in immunocompromised 
adults and children.15-19 Colonization is consid-
ered a major risk factor for invasive fungal infec-
tion in the preterm neonate.10,11,14,37 In our study, 
fluconazole was effective in preventing rather 
than treating colonization.
Exposure of newborns to fungi is a complex 
problem and results from both horizontal and 
vertical transmission. Treatment of maternal vag-
inal candidiasis and good hand hygiene of health 
care workers should reduce the risk of “new 
entry” candida in the NICU. Breaking the hori-
zontal NICU transmission cycle of hand coloni-

zation from caregivers to neonates and vice 
versa by fluconazole prophylaxis should reduce 
the risk that preterm infants pose to one an-
other.
Rates of candidemia in the NICU vary greatly 
among institutions. NICU-related factors (e.g., the 
average use of broad-spectrum antibiotic per in-
fant5) may be implicated, in addition to the well-
known preterm-related factors. Decreasing the 
incidence of infection would benefit a NICU’s 
present and future preterm infants, a factor that 
may lead to the adoption of intermittent prophy-
lactic regimens with the targeting of prophylaxis 
to ever-more-selected subgroups of high-risk neo-
nates.9,37 Prophylaxis should be adapted to the 
infection rate in each NICU to optimize the num-
ber needed to treat, in line with guidelines rec-
ommending antifungal prophylaxis in “carefully 
selected patients in units with high rates of in-
vasive candidiasis.”38 In our study, the number 
needed to treat was eight (five among extremely-
low-birth-weight infants) to prevent invasive fun-
gal infection.

* The exclusion of four infants who were originally assigned to the 3-mg group but actually received the 6-mg dose of fluconazole yields the follow-
ing risk ratios (as compared with the placebo group): for colonization, risk ratio, 0.34; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.18 to 0.67; P<0.001; for in-
vasive fungal infection, risk ratio, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.07 to 0.74; P = 0.007. However, the error in assignment does not change the P value for progres-
sion from colonization to invasive fungal infection (P = 0.47) and does not change the P value for mortality, since none of the four infants died.

of prophylactic fluconazole have been conducted 
among preterm infants, one in which 3 mg per 
kilogram of the drug was administered and the 
other in which 6 mg per kilogram was adminis-
tered.21,22 Our study was underpowered to detect 
differences in the outcome of invasive fungal in-
fection between the two groups, owing to the low 
incidence of such infection. Power analysis indi-
cated that approximately 1100 patients would be 
required for this evaluation.
A post hoc analysis was performed to evaluate 
the effect of at least 3 mg per kilogram of flu-
conazole by comparing both the 6-mg group and 
the 3-mg group with the placebo group. This 
analysis requires cautious interpretation. The high-
er dose could be more effective against strains 
that are dose-susceptible to fluconazole but could 
also be more toxic because of increased drug ex-
posure. In this study, at 4 weeks treated infants 
showed higher levels of alanine aminotransferase 
and significantly higher levels of aspartate amino-
transferase, although the levels remained within 
the normal reference range. However, at 6 weeks 
and at discharge, these modifications were not 
observed, and all treated neonates were discharged 
without abnormalities possibly caused by flucona-
zole. Mild and transient increases of liver enzymes, 
without clinical implications, are described in 
infants receiving fluconazole.21,22,39
Another concern regarding fluconazole pro-
phylaxis is the emergence of fungal resistance.18 
In this small, brief study, sensitivity of susceptible 
strains remained unchanged. (MIC90 remained be-
low the cutoff of NCCLS guidelines.) Another 
concern is the selection of natively resistant can-
dida species (e.g., C. glabrata and C. krusei), which 
are occasionally associated with fluconazole ex-
posure.40,41 Consistent with other, short-term stud-
ies,19,42 there was no significant change in can-
dida ecology among the three groups, and MICs 
for C. glabrata remained in the susceptible range 
during the study period. Nevertheless, our study 
was underpowered to detect a change in fungal 
ecology because of its short duration. Thus, we 
were unable to detect shifts in candida species 
or the establishment of acquired resistance muta-
tions. Long-term surveillance of fungal ecology 
will be important for NICUs that adopt a pro-
phylaxis strategy.
In this multicenter study, fluconazole prophy-
laxis reduced fungal colonization and infection 
in preterm neonates. Future studies should fur-
ther refine the identification of neonates who 
are at highest risk for infection for whom pro-
phylaxis would be most optimally suited. Such 
trials should also help to define the lowest effec-
tive dose for such prophylaxis and the possible 
long-term emergence of fungal resistance.
