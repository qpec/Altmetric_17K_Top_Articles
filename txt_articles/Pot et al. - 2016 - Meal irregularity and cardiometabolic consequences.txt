Studying irregular meal patterns fits in with the latest research focusing not only on what
people eat but also when they eat, also called chrono-nutrition. Chrono-nutrition involves
studying the impact of nutrition on metabolism via circadian patterns, including three
aspects of time: (ir)regularity, frequency and clock time. The present paper aimed to narra-
tively review research on irregular meal patterns and cardiometabolic consequences. Only
few cross-sectional studies and prospective cohort studies were identified, and most of
these suggested that eating meals irregularly is associated with a higher risk of the metabolic
syndrome and cardiometabolic risk factors, including BMI and blood pressure. This was
supported by two randomised controlled intervention studies showing that consuming
meals regularly for 2 weeks v. an irregular meal pattern, led to beneficial impact on cardio-
metabolic risk factors as lower peak insulin, lower fasting total and LDL-cholesterol, both
in lean and obese women. In conclusion, the limited evidence on meal regularity and
cardiometabolic consequences supports the hypothesis that consuming meals irregularly is
adversely associated with cardiometabolic risk. However, it also highlights the need for
more large-scale studies, including detailed dietary assessment to further advance the under-
standing of the impact of chrono-nutrition on public health.
Chrono-nutrition: Irregularity: Meal frequency: Cardiometabolic disease risk: Meal patterns
Chrono-biological effects of nutrition: what v. when we
eat
Our current lifestyle has become demanding and more ir-
regular. This is reflected in food consumption patterns,
which have changed markedly over the past decades:
more meals are skipped, consumed outside the family
context, on-the-go, later in the day and more irregular-
ly(1,2). The importance of eating regularly was high-
lighted early by Hippocrates (460–377 BC) and later by
Florence Nightingale in her Notes on Nursing, in which
she emphasised rest and regularity, including for food in-
take(3). More recently, irregularity of food intake has

non-communicable chronic diseases such as CVD and
metabolic syndrome(4–6). It has been hypothesised that
consuming irregular or inconsistent meals affects our in-
ternal body clock, also called chrono-biological or circa-
dian rhythms, and could thereby have an impact on
metabolic disease risk. Circadian rhythms are biological
rhythms that follow a 24 h cycle, from Latin meaning
‘approximate day’(7). It is known that many physiologic-
ally and nutritionally relevant processes in the human
body have circadian rhythms, including glycolysis and
gluconeogenesis, cholesterol and lipid metabolism, oxi-
dative phosphorylation and detoxification pathways(8,9).
This raises the question as to whether when we eat is
equally important as to what we eat. This also highlights
the need for understanding how the timing of dietary in-
take could affect chronic disease risk.
The
term
chrono-nutrition
was
introduced
by
Delabois in France in 1986 and was mainly applied in
the context of specific diets, with guidelines about what
foods to eat when(10). The term can be applied more
broadly when studying the impact of the timing of eating,
combining elements from both nutritional research and
chrono-biology(6). Using the term chrono-nutrition, it is
important to consider which aspects of time are included.
In the definition used here, chrono-nutrition includes
three aspects of time: (i) (ir)regularity (events at specific
times), (ii) frequency (number of events over a period
of time) and (iii) clock time (actual time of day). The pre-
sent paper is mainly focused on the first aspect of time:
(ir)regularity. Irregular meal patterns are defined here
as food eaten in varying amounts through the day and
at different times from one day to the next. Before
going into the evidence on meal irregularity in relation
to cardiometabolic disease risk, the effects of chrono-
disruption in one specific group of the population, shift
workers, will be presented.
Shift workers, disease risk and dietary patterns
An extreme form of living against internal body clocks is
observed in those working shifts, particularly night shifts.
It is known that shift workers have an increased risk of
chronic diseases such as cancer(11), CVD and the meta-
bolic syndrome(12). The evidence for the relationship be-
tween shift work and increased disease risk is strongest
for cancer. In 2007, the World Health Organisation/
International Agency for Research on Cancer published
a brief report based on an expert meeting and concluded
that shift work involving circadian disruption could be
considered probably carcinogenic to human subjects(13).
This was based on sufficient evidence from experimental
animal studies and limited evidence from human studies.
Most epidemiologic evidence has been focused on breast
cancer with meta-analyses showing a 40–50 % increased
risk of breast cancer associated with long-term (minimal-
ly 20–30 years) night shift work(14). For other types of
cancer, such as prostate and colorectal cancer, the evi-
dence was less conclusive but suggestive(12,15–17). The evi-
dence for a link between shift work and diseases other
than cancer is less conclusive, but suggests that those
working shifts have an increased risk of weight gain,
metabolic syndrome and vascular events. For weight
gain, a systematic review by van Drongelen et al. in
2011 of eight studies showed strong evidence for a
crude
relationship
between
weight
gain
and
shift
work(18). However, when confounders were taken into
account, the evidence for a relationship between shift
work and body weight change became insignificant. Of
the eight studies, five adjusted for potentially relevant
confounding variables, including age, gender, body
weight at baseline and physical activity, and only two
of the five were of high quality. These showed a positive
association between shift work and body weight gain(18).
For the metabolic syndrome, a systematic review by
Canuto et al. in 2013 of ten studies, identified eight stud-
ies that found a positive association between shift work
and metabolic syndrome after adjustment for sociodemo-
graphic and behavioural factors(19). However, only three
studies also adjusted for sleep duration and these showed
conflicting results. Sleep duration is considered an im-
portant potential confounding variable for the relation-
ship between shift work and disease risk. The reduction
of sleep duration, probably brought on by working in
shifts, can exert important adverse metabolic effects. A
systematic review by Patel and Hu in 2008, including
both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies revealed
that short sleep duration is independently associated
with weight gain, particularly in children aged 10 years
or less(20), thereby highlighting the need to consider
sleep duration as a potential confounder.
For vascular events, the evidence of a positive associ-
ation with shift work seems more convincing. A system-
atic review and meta-analysis by Vyas et al. in 2012 of
eleven prospective cohort studies, thirteen retrospective
cohort studies and ten case–control studies showed con-
vincing evidence that people working shifts have an ap-
proximately
20 %
increased
risk
of
myocardial
infarction (risk ratios (RR) 1·23 (95 % CI 1·15, 1·31)),
coronary events (RR 1·24 (95 % CI 1·10, 1·39)) and is-
chaemic stroke (RR 1·05 (95 % CI 1·01, 1·09))(21).
Their analysis of unadjusted and adjusted RR both indi-
cated similar results.
Thus, compared with individuals who work solely dur-
ing the day, shift workers, whose working routine leads
to chrono-disruption, are at a higher risk of developing
a range of metabolic diseases(22). It is quite possible
that this is related to changes in dietary patterns. A dis-
cussion paper by Lowden et al. in 2010 on eating and
shift work, effects on habits, metabolism and perform-
ance showed that at least some of the increased disease
risk of shift workers may be linked to diet and the irregu-
lar timing of eating(22). Their review comprised twenty-
three studies, and dietary intake information included
data on meal frequency, meal times and total energy in-
take and the dietary intake data were assessed using dif-
ferent methods, including FFQ and 24 h recalls. The
results of this review showed that total daily energy in-
take was similar for shift workers compared with non-
shift workers. However, shift workers had more irregular
eating patterns, altered meal frequency, usually impaired
quality of dietary intake and the distribution of dietary
intake over the day. For example, one study investigated

dietary intake of 101 mine workers in the USA and
found that those working night shifts reported an
increased number of meals consumed at different times,
more changes in their dietary patterns than when not
working at night, with a shift from three meals to often
one meal/d(23). Subjects also noted the changes in their
perception of eating habits when working night shifts
and reported increasing dissatisfaction with their eating
habits(23).
The findings of Lowden et al. are supported by results
from other cohort studies of shift workers(24–26). A study
in ninety-six male Swedish industrial workers found that
energy intake and quality of food were not affected by
shift work, but that the circadian distribution of food
changed and coffee consumption increased(24). A study
of twenty-two Brazilian garbage collectors working in
shifts also found no difference in their daily energy intake
when working night shifts in spite of differences in food
choices (which became mainly starchy foods, alcoholic
drinks and sweets) and circadian ingestion rhythms(25).
However, their total average daily energy intake was
very high (12–71 MJ/d (3000–6000 kcal/d)). Another
study of twenty-eight Brazilian shift workers found circa-
dian rhythmicity of energy consumed by night workers
but only during the summer(26). A study on anthropom-
etry and food intake patterns in bus drivers in Brazil
reported higher proportions of inappropriate feeding
practices, excess weight and abdominal obesity amongst
drivers who worked night shifts(27).
So far, few studies have specifically investigated how
consuming at a particular time of day relates to overall
dietary intake in human subjects(28,29). De Castro was
one of the first nutritional researchers to demonstrate
that dietary intake in the morning is particularly satiating
and can reduce the total amount consumed in a day,
while eating later in the evening is less satiating and
can lead to a greater overall daily intake(28). De Castro
also investigated specific types of foods and found that
eating low-density foods in the morning, such as fruit,
breakfast cereals, coffee and tea, and avoiding high-
density foods at night, such as meat, chips and snacks,
and alcohol, could be an overall strategy to reduce over-
all dietary intake(29). These studies demonstrated that
eating at a particular time of day was associated with
total daily dietary intake.
Overall it seems that when shift work leads to chrono-
disruption, changes in dietary patterns are an important
aspect to consider. Conversely, not only shift workers are
exposed to chrono-disruption. A less extreme form of liv-
ing against our internal body clock, but which affects far
more people, is caused by the so-called social jetlag(30).
Social jetlag is the discrepancy between our internal
body clocks and our social clock and this has also been
associated with increased risk for non-communicable
chronic diseases such as obesity(30) and the metabolic
syndrome(7). It has been estimated that social jetlag
affects more than 80 % of the general population in cen-
tral Europe(30), especially people living in urban areas.
The focus of this narrative review was to study the evi-
dence about consuming meals irregularly in relation to
cardiometabolic consequences in the general population.
Almoosawi et al. further discusses the impact of clock
time on nutritional intake and its association with disease
risk(31).
Evidence for meal irregularity and cardiometabolic
consequences
Observational studies
A summary of the evidence from observational studies
on meal irregularity and cardiometabolic consequences
is presented in Table 1. The first study identified was a
cross-sectional study of 3607 Swedish men and women
(1686
men
and
1921
women)
aged
60
years
by
Sierra-Johnson et al. in 2008(32). Information on meal re-
gularity was assessed using a questionnaire, including a
question ‘do you eat regular breakfast, lunch or evening
meal each day?’. Based on their answers, participants
were categorised as either regular eaters (answering ‘usu-
ally’ or ‘always’) or irregular eaters (answering ‘some-
times’ or ‘never’). Information on cardiometabolic risk
factors was assessed by a medical examination that
included laboratory tests assessing serum concentrations
of glucose, insulin, cholesterol and TAG. The metabolic
syndrome was calculated based on the updated Adult
Treatment Panel III criteria(33). Results showed that ir-
regular eaters had significantly greater mean weight,
waist circumference, BMI and TAG than regular eaters.
Irregular eaters had an increased prevalence of metabolic
syndrome components compared with regular eaters (P
< 0·001). Moreover, eating regularly was inversely asso-
ciated with the metabolic syndrome (OR 0·63 (95 % CI
0·45, 0·88)) and this was independent of traditional risk
factors, such as sex, smoking, education, physical activity
and consumption of fruit, vegetables and fish. Eating
regularly was particularly inversely associated with
waist circumference (OR 0·64 (95 % CI 0·47; 0·88)) and
directly related to HDL-cholesterol (OR 0·63 (95 % CI
0·45, 0·91)) and circulating γ-glutamyl transferase con-
centrations (OR 0·54 (95 % CI 0·35, 0·84)), believed to
be a marker of oxidative stress(34).
A study by Shin et al. in 2009 of 5337 Korean men
aged 30 years and over in a cross-sectional survey inves-
tigated the association between the intake frequencies of
certain foods and eating habits and the risk of the meta-
bolic syndrome(35). Eating habits included information
on meal frequency, breakfast frequency, mealtime regu-
larity, meal speed and overeating frequency. For the
question on mealtime regularity, participants either
answered always regular, often irregular or always irregu-
lar. In addition to this self-reported questionnaire, infor-
mation on the metabolic syndrome was assessed via a
clinical examination, including assessment of height
and weight, and taking of fasting venous blood samples
to assess glucose, TAG, and total and HDL-cholesterol.
Participants with the metabolic syndrome were more
likely to eat quickly (OR 2·23 (95 % CI 1·60, 3·12) for
fast v. slow) and overeat frequently (OR 2·37 (95 % CI
1·85, 3·05) comparing more than four times per week
v. less than once weekly). However, no statistical signifi-
cant association was found for meal time regularity

(OR 0·97 (95 % CI 0·71, 1·31), when comparing always
regular to always irregular).
Although the studies by Sierra-Johnson et al.(32) and
Shin et al.(35) provided interesting insights into the pos-
sible associations of meal irregularity and risk of the
metabolic syndrome, both studies were limited by the
fact that meal irregularity was assessed via a single ques-
tion in a questionnaire. Detailed dietary assessment
could provide more insight into the impact of meal ir-
regularity on cardiometabolic consequences.
Two observational studies on meal irregularity and
cardiometabolic consequences based on detailed dietary
assessment have been conducted by the authors(36,37).
Both were performed in the National Survey for Health
and Development, also known as the 1946 British birth
cohort(38). The first analysis investigated the association
between meal irregularity and the metabolic syndrome
in 1768 men and women aged 53 years(36). The metabolic
syndrome was assessed during a nurse visit and was
based on the Adult Treatment Panel III criteria with a
minor adaption of using Hb1Ac as fasting blood glucose
was not available(33). Dietary assessment was based on
5-d estimated food diaries, which included pre-defined
meal slots for breakfast, lunch, evening meal, and be-
tween meals. We developed a score for meal irregularity
which was based on the variability in energy intake per
meal relative to the 5-d mean of energy intake during
that meal, with a lower score indicating a more regular
meal pattern and a higher score indicating greater irregu-
larity(36). Mean irregularity scores were calculated for
each of the four time slots (breakfast, lunch, evening
meal and between meals) as well as for the daily total.
These irregularity scores were related to the metabolic
syndrome using logistic regression models, adjusting for
relevant confounding variables (sex, physical activity,
socio-economic status, marital status and smoking). An
increased risk of the metabolic syndrome was associated
with more irregular energy intake at breakfast (OR 1·34
(95 % CI 0·99, 1·81) comparing the highest tertile of ir-
regularity score with the lowest tertile; P trend = 0·04)
and between meals (OR 1·36 (95 % CI 1·01, 1·85); P
trend = 0·04). When investigating the components of
the metabolic syndrome, the strongest associations were
found for central obesity (based on waist circumference)
and obesity (based on BMI). For the other components
of the metabolic syndrome, including HDL-cholesterol,
TAG and systolic and diastolic blood pressure, no statis-
tical significant associations were found with meal irregu-
larity. It could be argued that those who consume meals
more irregularly may also underreport their total energy
intake more than regular consumers. However, these
associations remained when those who underreported
their total energy intake were excluded.
We next investigated how meal irregularity was asso-
ciated with subsequent risk of developing the metabolic
syndrome in the same National Survey for Health and
Development cohort(37). Five-day estimated food diaries
were available at ages 36, 43 and 53 years, and the
metabolic syndrome was assessed during a nurse visit
at age 53 years as previously described. Similar to the
cross-sectional analysis, a score for meal irregularity
was calculated for breakfast, lunch, evening meal, be-
tween meals and a daily total(36). Results showed that ir-
regularity scores changed significantly over the years
from when the cohort members were aged 36 years
(1982) to when the cohort members were 53 years
(1999; P linear mixed models <0·05), and the largest
changes in meal irregularity were observed for between
meals, which declined over time. At age 36 years, cohort
members with a more irregular intake of energy during
lunch (OR 1·42 (95 % CI 1·05, 1·91)) and between meals
(OR 1·35 (95 % CI 1·01, 1·82)) had an increased risk
of developing the metabolic syndrome 17 years later.
At age 43 years, cohort members with a more irregular
intake during breakfast had an increased risk of devel-
oping the metabolic syndrome 10 years later (OR 1·53
(95 % CI 1·15, 2·04)).
Thus, by using this score for meal irregularity based on
detailed dietary information, we found that individuals
with a more irregular intake, especially at breakfast,
lunch and between meals, had an increased risk of the
metabolic syndrome. These findings were confirmed by
a recent prospective cohort study from Norway by
Wennberg et al.(39) who found that irregular eating of
meals at age 16 years was associated with a higher preva-
lence of the metabolic syndrome 27 years later at age 43
years in 889 participants. However, they found that this
was largely explained by an unhealthy lifestyle at age
16 years and when correcting for lifestyle factors (such
as BMI at age 16 years, smoking, alcohol consumption,
physical activity and consumption of sweets and pastries
at age 16 years), the only statistically significant associ-
ation was observed for poor breakfast consumption.
A study in 6851 Spanish university graduates investi-
gated the specific impact of snacking on metabolic syn-
drome risk(40). Participants were classified into two
categories based on the response to the question ‘do
you have the habit of snacking between main meals?’
(yes or no). After a median follow-up time of 8·3 years
they found that 34·6 % of cohort members reported con-
suming snacks between meals. Snacking between main
meals was statistically significantly associated with a
higher risk of developing the metabolic syndrome (RR
1·44 (95 % CI 1·18, 1·77)). Furthermore, adherence to a
‘unhealthy snacking pattern’ was independently asso-
ciated with an increased incidence of the metabolic syn-
drome (RR 1·66 (95 % CI 1·23, 2·29)).
One study was identified that included measures of
meal irregularity, but did not assess cardiometabolic
risk factors per se. Sjöberg et al. studied meal patterns,
food choice and lifestyle factors in 1518 boys and girls
and found that a meal pattern with omission of breakfast
and lunch was related to a clustering of less healthy life-
style factors (e.g. smoking and consumption of snacks)
and food choice leading to poorer nutrient intake(41).
Therefore, although the evidence from observational
studies, especially those including detailed dietary infor-
mation, is scarce, it does point in the direction that con-
suming meals irregularly is associated with an increased
risk of the metabolic syndrome.

Randomised controlled trials
Although no specific randomised controlled trials were
identified that studied the effects of meal irregularity
and cardiometabolic consequences, two randomised con-
trolled trials were identified that examined the effects of
regular meal frequency. Farshchi et al. conducted two
randomised cross-over dietary intervention studies inves-
tigating the impact of irregular meal frequency pattern
on circulating lipids, insulin, glucose and uric acid in
nine healthy lean women(42) and ten healthy obese
women(43). The intervention consisted of two phases of
14 d each, during which the cohort members consumed
their normal diet on six occasions/d (regular) or by vary-
ing meal frequency (3–9 meals/d) with a 2-week washout
period between the two phases. The first study in lean
women (BMI 23·7 (SD 7·4) kg/m2) showed that fasting
glucose and insulin concentrations were not affected by
meal frequency, but peak insulin and area under the curve
responses to a test meal were higher after the irregular
meal routine compared with the regular meal routine(42).
Irregular meal frequency was also associated with higher
fasting total and LDL-cholesterol (P < 0·01) suggesting
that the irregular mealroutineappeared toproduce a degree
of impaired insulin resistance and higher fasting lipid
profiles. In the obese women (BMI 37·1 (SD 4·8) kg/m2),
results were very similar to what was found in lean
women, with no effect on fasting glucose and insulin, but
peak insulin responses to a test meal lower after the regular
meal pattern than after the irregular meal pattern(43). In
addition, the regular eating frequency was associated with
lower energy intake, greater postprandial thermogenesis
and lower fasting total and LDL-cholesterol(43).
These randomised controlled trials showed that an ir-
regular eating frequency seem to negatively impact fasting
lipid and postprandial insulin profiles and thermogenesis,
confirming the importance of meal patterns in influencing
carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in addition to the
amount and composition of food consumed.
Proposed underlying mechanisms
Although the evidence from observational and interven-
tion studies on meal irregularity and an increased cardi-
ometabolic risk is limited, a number of underlying
mechanisms serve to explain the results, mainly related
to chrono-biology(5,44,45). Many nutritionally related pro-
cesses in the body follow a circadian pattern, such as glu-
cose
homeostasis,
insulin
sensitivity,
postprandial
response and plasma lipids(9). Circadian rhythms in the
human body are a complex interaction of many circadian
patterns, which are thought to be controlled in two main
ways: via the central clock, the suprachiasmatic nucleus
in the hypothalamus, and by peripheral circadian clocks
which are present in nearly all organs and cells(6,8). The
suprachiasmatic nucleus is thought to be the master
clock and is entrained by external cues (‘zeitgebers’),
mainly light from eyes, as well as age and genes. The
suprachiasmatic nucleus coordinates the many peripheral
clocks, so that they maintain proper phase-relationships
with each other(8). In turn, peripheral clocks can be
entrained by zeitgebers, with dietary intake being a dom-
inant zeitgeber for many of these(46,47).
Animal models provide an excellent opportunity to
elucidate how circadian dysfunction could lead to differ-
ent pathologies and research has been primarily focused
on shifting the night–day cycle to imitate human jet lag
or shift work to study the effects of circadian rhythms.
Animal studies have indicated that the increased weight
gain observed within the shift work population is caused,
at least partly, by eating during the ‘wrong’ time of
day(6,48). A major finding to link chrono-disruption and
metabolic homeostasis at the molecular level was the dis-
covery of a specific 24-h circadian rhythmicity in adipose
tissue genes in 2005(49,50). Basic mechanistic links be-
tween circadian rhythms and metabolic regulation were
uncovered with the discovery of genes that showed circa-
dian rhythmicity. One example of such a gene is the cir-
cadian locomotor output cycles kaput (CLOCK) gene in
mutant mice, which was shown to greatly attenuate diur-
nal feeding rhythm. Mice lacking this gene were hyper-
phagic, obese and rapidly developed the metabolic
syndrome(51). Other genes, like Bmal1 and Per1/2 and
Cry1/2 were found to form an important transcription-
al–translational feedback loop in the circadian sys-
tem(6,52). The CLOCK and Bmal1 transcriptional–
translational feedback loop stimulates the transcriptional
activity of three period (Per) and two crytochrome (Cry)
genes. After appropriate temporal delay caused by post-
transcriptional modifications, the translated Per and Cry
proteins then form protein complexes that translocate into
the nucleus and inhibit their own transcription via inter-
action with CLOCK and Bmal1(9). Two recent reviews
by Johnston in 2014 summarise the evidence on the link
between circadian rhythms, metabolism and nutrition
with a particular focus on mouse and human studies(9)
and the physiological responses to food intake throughout
the day(53). It seems that the relationship between food in-
take and circadian rhythms are often reciprocal: circadian
systems can drive temporal changes in metabolic pathways
and changes in metabolic pathways can alter core molecu-
lar components of circadian rhythms(53). Metabolic
rhythms include daily changes in glucose homeostasis, in-
sulin sensitivity, postprandial response and plasma lipids.
Interestingly, it appears that the amplitude of some of
these rhythms is reduced in the obese, although this varies
from study to study and by hormone(9,53).
Recent work by Garaulet et al. investigated the link
between the timing of food intake during weight loss
studies and found that eating late may negatively impact
the success of weight loss in a cohort of 420 participants
(49·5 % female, aged 42 (SD 11) years, BMI 31·4 (SD 5·4)
kg/m2). They also included a SNP of CLOCK in their
investigations and found that the CLOCK rs4580704
was associated with the timing of the main meal, with
a higher frequency of minor allele C carriers among
late eaters. However, this CLOCK SNP, sleep duration
or chrono-type (morningness/eveningness) was not asso-
ciated with weight loss(54).

on cardiometabolic consequences, and the processes

involved, a conceptual framework is presented in Fig. 1.
Disrupted eating patterns, consisting of irregular meals,
different frequency of meals, as well as specific clock
time of meals, could lead to disruption of the internal
body clock. This in turn could lead directly to a positive
energy balance, which could then lead to metabolic dys-
function. Circadian disruption could also directly lead to
a positive energy balance. It is known that this disruption
of the internal body clock is affected by genetic differences,
for example in CLOCK genes(9). Disruption of the internal
body clock could have biochemical and molecular
impacts, such as an effect on the circadian responses of glu-
cose and lipids(9). Furthermore, when investigating the im-
pact of disrupted eating patterns on cardiometabolic risk,
it is important to consider the bigger picture of the meal, in
other words the composition of a meal, such as its fat con-
tent, and overall dietary quality as this could directly affect
cardiometabolic disease risk(55–57). Lastly, one element
that is very closely related to chrono-disruption and indir-
ectly also with food intake is sleep. Short sleep duration
has been associated with a positive energy balance(20). A
systematic review from our group showed a 1158 kJ
(277 kcal) higher energy intake after partial sleep depriv-
ation compared with control in seventeen studies, includ-
ing 496 participants (Al Khatib et al., unpublished
results). Sleep is therefore an important element of this
complex picture to consider when investigating the link be-
tween meal irregularity and cardiometabolic risk. In con-
clusion, irregularity of meals could lead to a wide range of
responses that could in turn lead to increased cardiometa-
bolic risk. Investigating the effects of meal irregularity on
cardiometabolic risk is just one piece of the puzzle of the
effects of the timing of eating.
Meal irregularity and meal frequency
Whilst the present paper was not specifically focused on
meal frequency and cardiometabolic risk factors, meal
irregularity is closely inter-linked with meal frequency,
as could also be observed in the randomised controlled
trials by Farshchi et al.(42,43). It has been hypothesised
that consuming small but frequent meals helps with
weight maintenance and enhances fat loss(58–60), a con-
cept that has been applied in many fad diets.
A number of observational studies support this hypoth-
esis, although it seems that this association differs some-
what for children compared with adults(61–64). A recent
review in children showed that three of five studies com-
prising overall 13 998 children and adolescents showed a
significant reduction of obesity risk with increasing num-
berof meals, which persisted afteradjustment for confoun-
ders; two other studies found non-significant trends in the
same direction(61). Smith et al. studied the association be-
tween daily eating frequency and cardiometabolic risk fac-
tors in 2775 young Australian adults aged 26–36 years and
found that a higher number of eating occasions was asso-
ciated with reduced cardiometabolic risk factors in young
men but not in young women(62).
In adults, the evidence for a relationship between meal
frequency and obesity is more mixed. Some studies have
found an inverse association between meal frequency
and overweight, for example a Swedish survey including
3610 men and women aged 25–74 years(63). However, a re-
view by Palmer et al. in 2009 specifically focusing on
weight loss intervention studies concluded that the limited
evidence available suggested that there is no association
between eating frequency and weight or health in either
weight loss or weight maintenance intervention studies(64).
Nonetheless, a possible inverse association between eating
frequency and lipids in weight-maintenance studies was
observed. Of the twenty-five studies included in their re-
view, only ten were specifically focused on weight-loss.
In addition, sample sizes were generally small, interven-
tions were relatively short-term and the definition of eating
occasion varied from study to study.
More recently, the association between eating fre-
quency, meal frequency and snack frequency and obesity

was investigated using data from the National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey (2003–2012), a large
observational study in 18 696 US adults based on two
24 h dietary recalls(65). Results showed a statistically sign-
ificantly higher risk of overweight and obesity for those
consuming ⩾5 meals compared with those consuming
⩽3 meals/d with an OR 1·54 (95 % CI 1·23, 1·93) for
men and an OR of 1·45 (95 % CI 1·17, 1·81) for
women; for central obesity an OR of 1·42 (95 % CI
1·15, 1·75) for men and an OR of 1·29 (95 % 1·05;1·59)
for women when adjusting for confounders including
dietary misreporting. However, the direction of the asso-
ciation between eating frequency and overweight and
obesity radically changed when adjustment for dietary
misreporting was not taken into account, highlighting
the need to consider dietary mis-reporting in these
types of analyses.
As there seems to be a positive association of meal fre-
quency and obesity risk in adults, one could argue that we
should consume fewer meals/d. A randomised controlled
cross-over pilot study investigated the effects of consuming
one meal/dv. threemeals/dintwenty men andwomen (aged
40–50 years, BMI normal range)(66). The intervention
lasted for 8 weeks with 11 weeks washout between the
two treatments and both treatments were iso-energy.
Fifteen subjects (ten women and five men) completed the
study (dropout rate 28·6 %). Results showed that blood
pressure, both systolic and diastolic, was significantly
lower (6 %) when consuming three meals/d v. one meal/d.
However, body weight was significantly higher when con-
suming three meals/d as well as fat mass. Moreover, they
found
pro-atherogenic
effects
(increased
total
and
LDL-cholesterol) and anti-atherogenic effects (increased
HDL-cholesterol and decreased TAG) after consuming
three meals/d. Consuming one meal/d decreased cortisol
concentrations and led to more hunger, desire to eat, and
prospective consumption was estimated higher and feelings
of fullness were significantly lower. Although the results of
this pilot study showed that normal-weight subjects were
able to comply with a one meal/d regimen, the findings sug-
gest that, without a reduction in energy intake, a reduced
meal frequency does not offer major health benefits in
human subjects(66).
Proposed mechanisms that explain the association be-
tween meal frequency and obesity include better appetite
control, improved glucose homeostasis and increase in
the thermic effect of food(58). With ageing comes a de-
cline in the ability to regulate food intake, e.g. less able
to compensate for higher energy intake, due to altered
hormonal signals such as cholecystokinin, glucagon-like
peptide 1 and peptide YY cholecystokinin, glucagon-
like peptide 1, and peptide YY and impaired senses
taste and smell(60), which may explain some these differ-
ences observed in children and adults.
Food for thought
This new emerging line of research warrants further food
for thought and there are several aspects to consider
related to the research included in the present paper.
The inconsistency in terminology used in this novel
area made it difficult to identify all the evidence. The
term
chrono-nutrition
was
introduced
in
1986
by
Delabois(10) but was not much used beyond its applica-
tion in weight loss diets. Other commonly used terms in-
clude circadian patterns of nutrition intake, (ir)regular
feeding
pattern,
meal
patterns
and
meal
routines.
Therefore, we propose use of the term chrononutrition
when studying the impact of food intake on metabolism
via the circadian clock system.
The present paper was focussed on the irregularity of
meals and for this it is important to consider the diversity
in definitions of meals or meal patterns as discussed by
Berg and Forslund(67). The inconsistency in definitions
of eating occasions or meals may complicate interpret-
ation and comparison of research results. For example,
the term ‘meal’ is common in literature and often corre-
sponds to the main meal: breakfast, lunch or evening
meal. The classification of temporal distribution of
meals is usually based on cultural norms(67,68). Recent
analysis by Leech et al. showed in an Australian survey
that a neutral definition (individual eating occasions
separated by a specific time interval, such as 15 min)
was best in predicting variance in total energy intake(69).
A review by Leech et al. in 2015 found that most studies
included in their review use a participant-identified ap-
proach(70). This is in line with our studies using food diar-
ies with pre-structured mealtime slots where it was up to
participants who completed these food diaries to inter-
pret what these labels meant.
The word irregularity can also be interpreted in several
different ways. In this research, irregular meal patterns
were defined as food being eaten in varying amounts
through the day and at different times from one day to
the next. However, meal irregularity could also be inter-
preted as being related to meal frequency, as was
observed in the studies by Farshchi et al.(42,43) making
the distinction between meal irregularity and meal fre-
quency somewhat distorted.
The results of this review did not allow us to investigate
whether the impact of the timing of eating on cardiometa-
bolic risk could differ in specific groups of the population,
e.g. men v. women, or children v. older adults although the
evidence from experimental studies seems to suggest there
could be differences between these groups. For example,
the differential relationship of eating frequency and cardi-
ometabolic risk factors between men and women was dis-
cussed by Smith et al.(62). They speculated as to why they
observed an association of daily eating frequency and car-
diometabolic risk factors in men but not in women and
suggested that women who ate more often were eating un-
healthy snacks and underreported these items in the FFQ
or their extra meals and snacks, which resulted in higher
energy intakes. In addition, they speculated that it might
be due to the different fat distribution in men and
women with men storing their fat more centrally and
women more peripherally. Generally, central obesity is
considered to be more harmful for cardiometabolic health
than peripheral fat.

consequences could be related to a decline in the ability
to regulate food intake, e.g. less able to compensate for
higher energy intake, due to altered hormonal signals
such as cholecystokinin, glucagon-like peptide 1and pep-
tide YY and impaired senses taste and smell(60).
The findings of this review also emphasised the im-
portance of the assessment method for meal irregularity
and raises the question whether meal irregularity can
be assessed in a single question or whether more detailed
dietary information, such as food diaries, provides more
insight into this important topic. As with other studies
that include dietary assessment, dietary underreporting
is also essential to consider. Studies have shown that
underreporters on one occasion were likely to be an
underreporter on other occasions(71), therefore including
dietary misreporting the analyses of meal regularity and
any health outcome seems essential.
When comparing the levels of underreporting in chil-
dren and adults, it has been shown that the percentage
of children who underreport energy intake is usually
somewhat smaller compared with adults(72), which may
in part also contribute to the differences in findings
observed for children and adults with regards to meal ir-
regularity and cardiometabolic consequences.
Further directions
In general, the impact of dietary intake on metabolic
health is a complex multi-dimensional picture and to un-
ravel this complex picture, one has to focus on one par-
ticular aspect first before this can be placed in the
bigger context. To fully understand the impact of the
timing of eating on metabolic disease risk other elements,
such as frequency and clock time also need to be taken
into account. A review by McCrory and Campbell in
2011 suggested that when examining eating patterns,
such as eating frequency, snacking or breakfast con-
sumption, it is not very meaningful to do so in isolation
as in the real world these eating behaviours are very
much intertwined(73). Moreover, when studying the im-
pact of irregular meal patterns, it is also important to
consider what people eat, for example regular overcon-
sumption of unhealthy foods is not considered to be ben-
eficial for our health. It has been observed that there is an
association between meal patterns and diet quality. This
is supported by the recent review by Leech et al. who
found that an association with meal patterns and diet
quality, and more specifically an inverse association be-
tween breakfast skipping and diet quality(70).
An even further step after studying the impact of what
and when we eat is to study where we eat and with whom
we eat. A recent meta-analysis showed that family meal
frequency contributes to more healthy eating among chil-
dren and adolescents(74), with positive associations be-
tween
family
meals
and
adolescent
dietary
intake
including fruit and vegetables consumption, dairy con-
sumption and less consumption of sugar-sweetened bev-
erages(75). Sleep timing is the most prominent expression
of the internal body clock(76) and hence it would be
crucial to include sleep in the overall picture of the com-
plex associations of chrono-nutrition and disease risk.
This review was concentrated on the impact of meal ir-
regularity on cardiometabolic risk factors, but studies in
shift workers indicate that they are also at an increased
risk of developing other diseases such as cancer(6).
Cancer is among the leading causes of death worldwide
and evidence from the World Cancer Research Fund/
American Institute of Cancer Research has estimated
that about one third of all cancers could be prevented
by a healthier diet, having a healthier weight and being
more physically active(77). Therefore, it would be very
relevant to study the impact of meal irregularity on can-
cer risk. The evidence from the 2007 World Cancer
Research Fund/American Institute of Cancer Research
report on food, nutrition, physical activity and the pre-
vention of cancer suggests that people are at an increased
risk of stomach cancer when consuming meals irregularly
as opposed to regular eating, however there was too
much heterogeneity amongst the studies to make a firm
judgement(77). Therefore, more studies are needed, par-
ticularly
with
detailed
dietary
information,
which
would allow the study of chrono-nutritional effects in
large prospective cohorts and in disease outcomes like
CVD as well as cancer.
Public health implications
When combatting the effects of chronic disease, food
timing has emerged as a new approach to the treatment
of obesity and the metabolic syndrome(78). A recent re-
view of dietary therapies and innovative time-associated
dietary approaches concluded that regular meal eating
habits might facilitate maintaining weight while un-
planned snacking as well as consuming the major part
of the energy intake at the end of the day seem to be
unfavourable(67). The work by Garaulet and Gómez-
Abellán also showed the importance of the timing of
eating in weight loss studies(79,80).
Another important aspect to consider when studying
meal habits and its potential use for public health inter-
ventions is to consider when dietary habits are formed.
Generally, dietary habits are formed early in life and it
is therefore important to consider the context of eating,
and to study young adults to identify meal routines and
practices and healthy dietary factors(81).
Conclusions
Overall, this narrative review showed that it is important
to further advance research about not only what people
eat but also when they eat. Although the evidence from
robust observational and intervention studies including
those based on detailed dietary assessment is limited, re-
search to date appears to indicate that consuming meals
irregularly could increase cardiometabolic risk. It also
highlights the need for more large-scale observational
and intervention studies, which have detailed dietary as-
sessment, to further advance the understanding of the
Meal irregularity and cardio-metabolic risk

impact of chrono-nutrition on public health. The circa-
dian clock appears to operate as a critical interface be-
tween nutrition and homeostasis, and this calls for
more attention to the beneficial effects of chrono-
nutrition(82), including the adaptation of the term ‘chrono-
nutrition’. Until then, the advice from Hippocrates and
Florence Nightingale emphasising the importance of re-
gularity probably also holds for dietary intake.
