CDC Adoption of ACIP Recommendations
Recommendations for routine use of vaccines in children, 
adolescents and adults are developed by the Advisory Committee 
on Immunization Practices (ACIP). ACIP is chartered as a federal 
advisory committee to provide expert external advice and guidance 
to the Director of CDC on use of vaccines and related agents for 
the control of vaccine-preventable diseases in the civilian population 
of the United States. Recommendations for routine use of vaccines 
in children and adolescents are harmonized to the greatest extent 
possible with recommendations made by the American Academy 
of Pediatrics (AAP), the American Academy of Family Physicians 
(AAFP), and the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology 
(ACOG). Recommendations for routine use of vaccines in adults 
are harmonized with recommendations of AAFP
, ACOG, and the 
American College of Physicians (ACP). ACIP recommendations 
adopted by the CDC Director become agency guidelines on the 
date published in MMWR. Additional information regarding ACIP 
is available at http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip).

Summary
This report updates the 2015–16 recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) regarding the 
use of seasonal influenza vaccines (Grohskopf LA, Sokolow LZ, Olsen SJ, Bresee JS, Broder KR, Karron RA. Prevention and control 
of influenza with vaccines: recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, United States, 2015–16 
influenza season. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep 2015;64:818–25). Routine annual influenza vaccination is recommended 
for all persons aged ≥6 months who do not have contraindications. For the 2016–17 influenza season, inactivated influenza 
vaccines (IIVs) will be available in both trivalent (IIV3) and quadrivalent (IIV4) formulations. Recombinant influenza vaccine 
(RIV) will be available in a trivalent formulation (RIV3). In light of concerns regarding low effectiveness against influenza 
A(H1N1)pdm09 in the United States during the 2013–14 and 2015–16 seasons, for the 2016–17 season, ACIP makes the 
interim recommendation that live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV4) should not be used. Vaccine virus strains included in the 
2016–17 U.S. trivalent influenza vaccines will be an A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)–like virus, an A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 
(H3N2)–like virus, and a B/Brisbane/60/2008–like virus (Victoria lineage). Quadrivalent vaccines will include an additional 
influenza B virus strain, a B/Phuket/3073/2013–like virus (Yamagata lineage).
Recommendations for use of different vaccine types and specific populations are discussed. A licensed, age-appropriate vaccine 
should be used. No preferential recommendation is made for one influenza vaccine product over another for persons for whom 
more than one licensed, recommended product is otherwise appropriate. This information is intended for vaccination providers, 
immunization program personnel, and public health personnel. Information in this report reflects discussions during public 
meetings of ACIP held on October 21, 2015; February 24, 2016; and June 22, 2016. These recommendations apply to all licensed 
influenza vaccines used within Food and Drug Administration–licensed indications, including those licensed after the publication 
of this report. Updates and other information are available at CDC’s influenza website (http://www.cdc.gov/flu). Vaccination 
and health care providers should check CDC’s influenza website periodically for additional information.
Introduction
Influenza viruses typically circulate widely in the United 
States annually, from the late fall through early spring. 
Although most persons who become infected with influenza 
viruses will recover without sequelae, influenza can cause 
serious illness and death, particularly among older adults, 
very young children, pregnant women, and those with 
chronic medical conditions (1–3). During 31 seasons 
from the 1976–77 through the 2006–07 season, estimated 
influenza-associated deaths ranged from approximately 3,300 
to 49,000 annually (4). Annual influenza vaccination is the 
primary means of preventing influenza and its complications. 
A variety of different types of influenza vaccine are available. 
Abbreviation conventions for the different types of vaccine 
have evolved over time (Box). Routine annual influenza 
vaccination for all persons aged ≥6 months who do not have 
contraindications has been recommended by CDC and CDC’s

MMWR / August 26, 2016 / Vol. 65 / No. 5
US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) 
since 2010 (5). This report updates the 2015–16 ACIP 
recommendations regarding the use of seasonal influenza 
vaccines (6) and provides recommendations and guidance for 
vaccination providers regarding the use of influenza vaccines 
for the 2016–17 season.
Methods
ACIP provides annual recommendations for the prevention 
and control of influenza. The ACIP Influenza Work Group 
meets by teleconference once to twice per month throughout 
the year. Work Group membership includes several voting 
members of ACIP and representatives of ACIP Liaison 
Organizations.* Discussions include topics such as influenza 
surveillance, vaccine effectiveness and safety, vaccine coverage, 
program feasibility, cost-effectiveness, and vaccine supply. 
Presentations are requested from invited experts, and published 
and unpublished data are discussed.
For unchanged recommendations, literature published since 
release of the last ACIP influenza Recommendations and Reports 
in MMWR (September, 2013) (7) was reviewed. Updates to the 
recommendations described in in this document are of three 
types: 1) the vaccine viruses included in the 2016–17 seasonal 
influenza vaccines, 2) new vaccine licensures and approvals, and 
3) an interim recommendation that live attenuated influenza 
vaccine (LAIV4) not be used during the 2016–17 season.
Recommendations for vaccine viruses to be included in 
Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccines are made by the World 
Health Organization (WHO), which organizes a consultation, 
generally in February of each year, to make recommendations for 
vaccine composition. Surveillance data are reviewed and candidate 
vaccine viruses are discussed. A summary of the WHO meeting 
for selection of the 2016–17 Northern Hemisphere vaccine 
viruses is available at http://www.who.int/influenza/vaccines/
virus/recommendations/201602_recommendation.pdf?ua=1. 
Subsequently, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which 
has regulatory authority over vaccines in the United States, convenes 
a meeting of its Vaccines and Related Biologic Products Advisory 
Committee (VRBPAC), which considers the recommendations 
of WHO, reviews and discusses similar data, and makes a final 
decision regarding vaccine virus composition for influenza vaccines 
licensed and marketed in the United States. A summary of the FDA 
VRBPAC meeting of March 4, 2016, at which composition of 
the 2016–17 U.S. influenza vaccines was discussed, is available 
at http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AdvisoryCommittees/
CommitteesMeetingMaterials/BloodVaccinesandOtherBiologics/
VaccinesandRelatedBiologicalProductsAdvisoryCommittee/
UCM494071.pdf.
With regard to recommendations for newly licensed influenza 
vaccines and changes to the licensed indications for existing 
vaccines, ACIP relies on FDA, which has regulatory authority 
for review of safety, immunogenicity, and effectiveness data 
and licensure of influenza vaccines. Regulatory information 
pertinent to the two recently licensed products discussed 
in this report may be found at http://www.fda.gov/
BiologicsBloodVaccines/SafetyAvailability/VaccineSafety/

Carolina) and at http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/
Vaccines/ApprovedProducts/ucm502844.htm (for Flucelvax; 
Seqirus, Holly Springs, North Carolina).
For interim changes in the recommendation for use of 
LAIV4, in June 2016, ACIP reviewed newly available data 
concerning the effectiveness of LAIV4 for the 2015–16 season. 
The information reviewed comes from three unpublished 
observational studies. Presentations of preliminary data 
reviewed by the ACIP may be found at http://www.cdc.gov/
vaccines/acip/meetings/meetings-info.html. Minutes of the 
June ACIP meeting may be found at http://www.cdc.gov/
vaccines/acip/meetings/minutes-archive.html. ACIP will 
review subsequent data as they become available.
Information presented in this report reflects recommendations 
presented during ACIP public meetings and approved on 
October 21, 2015; February 24, 2016; and June 22, 2016. 
Meeting minutes and information on ACIP membership and

BOX. Abbreviation conventions for influenza vaccines used in 
this report
• Inactivated influenza vaccines are abbreviated IIV. For 
the 2016–17 season, IIVs as a class will include:
 
– Egg-based, unadjuvanted, and adjuvanted trivalent 
influenza vaccines (IIV3s); and
 
– Egg-based or cell culture-based unadjuvanted 
quadrivalent influenza vaccines (IIV4s).
• RIV refers to recombinant hemagglutinin influenza 
vaccine, available as a trivalent formulation (RIV3) 
for the 2016–17 season.
• LAIV refers to live-attenuated influenza vaccine, 
available as a quadrivalent formulation (LAIV4) since 
the 2013–14 season.
• IIV, RIV, and LAIV denote vaccine categories; 
numeric suffix specifies the number of HA antigens in 
the vaccine.
• When necessary to refer specifically to cell culture-
based vaccine, the prefix “cc” is used (e.g., “ccIIV4”).
• When necessary to refer specifically to adjuvanted 
vaccine, the prefix “a” is used (e.g., “aIIV3”).

conflicts of interest are available on the ACIP website (http://
www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip). Modifications were made to the 
ACIP recommendations during subsequent review at CDC to 
update and clarify wording in the document. Further updates, 
if needed, will be posted at CDC’s influenza website (http://
www.cdc.gov/flu).
Primary Changes and Updates in the 
Recommendations
Routine annual influenza vaccination of all persons aged 
≥6 months without contraindications continues to be 
recommended. No preferential recommendation is made 
for one influenza vaccine product over another for persons 
for whom more than one licensed, recommended product is 
otherwise appropriate. Updated information and guidance in 
this document includes the following:
• In light of low effectiveness against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 
in the United States during the 2013–14 and 2015–16 
seasons, for the 2016–17 season, ACIP makes the interim 
recommendation that LAIV4 should not be used. Because 
LAIV4 is still a licensed vaccine that might be available 
and that some providers might elect to use, for informational 
purposes, reference is made to previous recommendations 
for its use.
• 2016–17 U.S. trivalent influenza vaccines will contain an 
A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)–like virus, an A/Hong 
Kong/4801/2014 (H3N2)–like virus and a B/Brisbane/ 
60/2008–like virus (Victoria lineage). Quadrivalent vaccines 
will include an additional vaccine virus strain, a B/Phuket/ 
3073/2013–like virus (Yamagata lineage).
• Recent new vaccine licensures are discussed:
 
– An MF59-adjuvanted trivalent inactivated influenza 
vaccine (aIIV3), Fluad (Seqirus, Holly Springs, North 
Carolina), was licensed by FDA in November 2015 for 
persons aged ≥65 years. Regulatory information is available 
at http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/
SafetyAvailability/VaccineSafety/ucm473989.htm. aIIV3 
is an acceptable alternative to other vaccines licensed for 
persons in this age group. ACIP and CDC do not express 
a preference for any particular vaccine product.
 
– A quadrivalent formulation of Flucelvax (cell culture-
based inactivated influenza vaccine [ccIIV4], Seqirus, 
Holly Springs, North Carolina) was licensed by FDA in 
May 2016, for persons aged ≥4 years. Regulatory 
information is available at: http://www.fda.gov/
BiologicsBloodVaccines/Vaccines/ApprovedProducts/
ucm502844.htm. ccIIV4 is an acceptable alternative to 
other vaccines licensed for persons in this age group. No 
preference is expressed for any particular vaccine product.
• Recommendations for influenza vaccination of persons 
with egg allergy have been modified, including
 
– Removal of the recommendation that egg-allergic 
recipients should be observed for 30 minutes 
postvaccination for signs and symptoms of an allergic 
reaction. Providers should consider observing all 
patients for 15 minutes after vaccination to decrease 
the risk for injury should they experience syncope, 
per the ACIP General Recommendations on 
Immunization (8).
 
– A recommendation that persons with a history of severe 
allergic reaction to egg (i.e., any symptom other than hives) 
should be vaccinated in an inpatient or outpatient medical 
setting (including but not necessarily limited to hospitals, 
clinics, health departments, and physician offices), under 
the supervision of a health care provider who is able to 
recognize and manage severe allergic conditions.
Background and Epidemiology
Biology of Influenza
Influenza A and B are the two types of influenza viruses that cause 
epidemic human disease. Influenza A and B viruses are further 
separated into subtypes (for A viruses) and lineages (for B viruses) 
on the basis of antigenic differences. Influenza A viruses are 
categorized into subtypes on the basis of characterization of two 
surface antigens: hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). 
Influenza A(H1N1) viruses, influenza A(H3N2) viruses, and 
influenza B viruses co-circulate globally. New influenza virus 
variants emerge as a result of point mutations and recombination 
events that occur during viral replication, resulting in frequent 
antigenic change (i.e., antigenic drift) (9). Immunity to surface 
antigens, HA and NA, reduces likelihood of infection (10,11). 
Antibody against one influenza virus type or subtype confers 
limited or no protection against another type or subtype (12). 
Frequent emergence of antigenic variants through antigenic 
drift is the virologic basis for seasonal epidemics and necessitates 
consideration for adjustment of vaccine viruses each season.
Larger genetic changes, or antigenic shifts, occur among 
influenza A viruses, less frequently than antigenic drift events. 
The new or substantially different influenza A virus subtypes 
resulting from antigenic shifts have the potential to cause 
pandemics when they cause human illness because they might 
be transmitted efficiently from human to human in a sustained 
manner and because there is little or no pre-existing immunity 
among humans (9). In April 2009, human infections with a novel 
 Recommendations and Reports

US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
influenza A(H1N1) virus caused a worldwide pandemic. This 
virus was antigenically distinct from human influenza A(H1N1) 
viruses in circulation from 1977 through spring 2009. The 
HA gene is related most closely to that of contemporary influenza 
A viruses circulating among pigs during several preceding 
decades. This HA gene is believed to have evolved from the 
avian-origin 1918 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) virus and is 
thought to have entered human and swine populations at about 
the same time (13,14).
Influenza B viruses are separated into two distinct genetic 
lineages (Yamagata and Victoria) but are not categorized into 
subtypes. Influenza B viruses undergo antigenic drift less rapidly 
than influenza A viruses (15). Influenza B viruses from both 
lineages have co-circulated in most influenza seasons since the 
1980s (16,17). The trivalent influenza vaccines available in recent 
seasons have contained one influenza B virus, representing only 
one lineage. The proportion of circulating influenza B viruses 
that are of the lineage represented in the vaccine has varied. 
During the 10 seasons from 2001–02 through 2010–11, the 
predominant circulating influenza B virus lineage in the United 
States was represented in the trivalent vaccine in only five seasons 
(18). During the 11 seasons from 2004–05 through 2015–16 
(the 2009 pandemic period was excluded because there was 
minimal influenza B activity), the more prevalent circulating 
B lineage was represented in the vaccine in eight seasons (CDC, 
unpublished data, 2016).
Burden of Influenza Illness
Although precise timing of the onset, peak, and end of 
influenza activity varies from one season to the next, annual 
epidemics of seasonal influenza typically occur in the United 
States between October and April. Studies that report rates 
of clinical outcomes without laboratory confirmation of 
influenza (e.g., respiratory illness requiring hospitalization 
during influenza season) can be difficult to interpret because 
of coincident circulation of other respiratory pathogens (e.g., 
respiratory syncytial virus) (19–21). However, increases in 
health care provider visits for acute febrile respiratory illness 
occur annually, coinciding with periods of increased influenza 
activity, making influenza-like illness (ILI) surveillance 
systems valuable in understanding the seasonal and geographic 
occurrence of influenza each year (22).
Persons of all age groups are susceptible to influenza. Data 
from the Influenza Incidence Surveillance Project (IISP) 
covering the 2009–10 through 2012–13 seasons revealed 
the highest rates of outpatient visits for influenza-positive 
ILI occurred among children aged 2 through 17 years (23). 
Complications, hospitalizations, and deaths from seasonal 
influenza are typically greatest among persons aged ≥65 years, 
children aged <5 years (and particularly those aged <2 years), 
and persons of any age who have medical conditions that confer 
increased risk for complications from influenza (1–4,24–29).
In typical winter influenza seasons, increases in deaths and 
hospitalizations are observed during periods when influenza 
viruses are circulating. Although not all excess events occurring 
during periods when influenza viruses are circulating can be 
attributed to influenza, these estimates are useful for following 
season-to-season trends in influenza-associated outcomes. 
Estimates that include only outcomes attributed to pneumonia 
and influenza (P&I) likely underestimate the burden of 
severe illnesses that are at least partly attributable to influenza 
because this category excludes deaths and hospitalizations 
caused by exacerbations of underlying cardiac and pulmonary 
conditions that are associated with influenza infection (30–32). 
Thus, some authors use the broader category of respiratory 
and circulatory excess events for influenza burden estimates. 
During seasonal influenza epidemics from 1979–1980 
through 2000–2001, the estimated annual overall number 
of influenza-associated hospitalizations in the United States 
ranged from approximately 55,000 to 431,000 per annual 
epidemic, with a mean of 226,000 (31). Between the 1976–77 
and the 2006–07 seasons, estimated annual deaths in the 
United States attributable to influenza ranged from 3,349 to 
48,614 each season (4). A subsequent modeling analysis of 
population-based surveillance data for seasons following the 
2009 pandemic (2010–2011 through 2012–2013), which used 
a multiplier method developed to correct for underdetection 
in hospitalizations attributable to cases for which influenza 
testing was not performed and for insufficient test sensitivity, 
estimated that influenza was associated with 114,018–633,001 
hospitalizations, 18,476–96,667 intensive care unit (ICU) 
admissions, and 4,866–27,810 deaths per year. Among these, 
an estimated 54%–70% of hospitalizations and 71%–85% of 
deaths occurred among adults aged ≥65 years (33).
Children
Influenza is an important cause of outpatient medical visits 
and hospitalizations among young children. In a population-
based study conducted in three metropolitan areas (Nashville, 
Tennessee; Rochester, New York; and Cincinnati, Ohio) during 
the 2002–03 and 2003–04 seasons, children aged <5 years 
with acute respiratory illness or fever caused by laboratory-
confirmed influenza (LCI) accounted for 10% (2002–03) and 
19% (2003–04) of medical office visits and 6% (2002–03) 
and 29% (2003–04) of emergency department (ED) visits 
(3) From these data, the rate of clinic visits for influenza was 
estimated to be 50 (2002–03) and 95 (2003–04) visits per 
1,000 children aged <5 years, and the rate of ED visits was 6 
(2002–03) and 27 (2003–04) visits per 1,000 children aged 
 Recommendations and Reports

<5 years. In a retrospective cohort study of children aged 
<15 years over 19 seasons (1974–75 through 1992–93), an 
estimated average of 6–15 additional outpatient visits and 3–9 
additional antibiotic courses per 100 children per season were 
attributed to influenza (25). During 1993–2004 in the Boston 
area, the rate of ED visits for respiratory illness attributed to 
influenza based on viral surveillance data among children 
aged 6 months–7 years during the winter respiratory illness 
season ranged from 22.1 per 1,000 children aged 6–23 months 
to 5.4 per 1,000 children aged 5–7 years (34). In a study 
conducted in a single county in Tennessee during the 2000–01 
through 2010–11 seasons, estimated rates of influenza-related 
hospitalizations among children aged 6 through 59 months 
varied from 1.9 to 16 per 10,000 children per year; estimated 
rates of ED visits ranged from 89 to 620 per 10,000 children 
per year (35).
Estimated rates of influenza-associated hospitalization 
generally are substantially higher among infants and children 
aged <5 years than among older children (36–42). During 
1993–2008, estimated annual rates of influenza-associated 
hospitalizations were 151.0 per 100,000 among children aged 
<1 years and 38.8 per 100,000 among children aged 1–4 years, 
compared with 16.8 per 100,000 among persons aged 5 through 
49 years (40). Estimates of influenza-related hospitalization rates 
for children with high-risk medical conditions are higher than 
for those without such conditions (26,43,44).
In the United States, death associated with LCI among 
children aged <18 years has been a nationally reportable 
condition since October 2004 (45). Since reporting began, the 
annual number of influenza-associated pediatric deaths during 
regular influenza seasons has ranged from 37 to 171 deaths per 
season. A larger number of deaths were reported during the 
2009 pandemic, for which 358 pediatric deaths were reported 
to CDC from April 15, 2009 through October 2, 2010 (46).
Younger Adults
Among healthy younger adults, illness caused by seasonal 
influenza is typically less severe and results less frequently in 
hospitalization, as compared with children aged <5 years, adults 
aged ≥65 years, pregnant women, or persons with chronic 
medical conditions. However, influenza is an important cause 
of outpatient medical visits and worker absenteeism among 
healthy adults. In one economic modeling analysis that used 
health insurance claims data and projections of either earnings 
or statistical life values, the average annual burden of seasonal 
influenza among adults aged 18–49 years without medical 
conditions that confer a higher risk for influenza complications 
was estimated to include approximately 5 million illnesses, 
2.4 million outpatient visits, 32,000 hospitalizations, and 
680 deaths (47). Studies of worker vaccination have reported 
lower rates of ILI (48,49), lost work time (48–51), and health 
care visits (49,50) in association with vaccination as compared 
with no vaccine or placebo.
During the 2009 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic 
(2009[H1N1] pandemic), adults aged <65 years appeared 
to be at higher risk for influenza-related hospitalizations 
and deaths (52) as compared with typical influenza seasons. 
During the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic period (for 
the period April 2009 through May 1, 2010), the cumulative 
rates of LCI-related hospitalization for the Emerging Infections 
Program (EIP; http://www.cdc.gov/ncezid/dpei/eip/index.html) 
sites were 3.0 per 10,000 persons aged 18–49 years, 3.8 per 
10,000 persons aged 50–64 years, and 3.2 per 10,000 persons 
aged ≥65 years. During the previous three seasons, rates had 
ranged from 0.3–0.7 per 10.000 persons aged 18–49 years to 
0.4–1.5 per 10.000 persons aged 50–64 years and 1.4–7.5 per 
10.000 persons aged ≥65 years (53). Adults aged 50–64 years 
had the highest mortality rate during the 2009 pandemic. 
This group was again severely affected during the 2013–14 
season when H1N1pdm09 was the predominant virus, 
sustaining higher hospitalization rates than in previous 
seasons since the pandemic (54).
Older Adults
Hospitalization rates during typical influenza seasons are highest 
for adults aged ≥65 years. One retrospective analysis of data from 
three managed-care organizations collected during 1996–1997 
through 1999–2000 estimated that the risk during influenza 
season among persons aged ≥65 years with high-risk underlying 
medical conditions was 55.6 pneumonia and influenza-associated 
hospitalizations per 10,000 persons, compared with 18.7 per 
10,000 among lower risk persons in this age group. Persons aged 
50–64 years who had underlying medical conditions also were at 
substantially increased risk for hospitalization during influenza 
season compared with healthy adults aged 50–64 years (12.3 versus 
1.8 per 10,000 person-periods) (28).
Deaths associated with influenza are most frequent among 
older adults. From the 1976–2007 seasons, an estimated yearly 
average of 21,098 influenza-related deaths occurred among 
adults aged ≥65 years, corresponding to 90% of estimated 
annual average deaths across all age groups (4). In comparison, 
the average annual mortality was estimated to be 124 deaths 
among persons aged <19 years and 2,385 deaths among persons 
aged 19–64 years. In a later modeling analysis of population-
based surveillance data covering the 2010–11 through the 
2012–13 seasons, an estimated 71%–85% of deaths occurred 
among adults aged ≥65 years (33).

Pregnant Women and Neonates
Pregnant women are vulnerable to severe symptoms and 
illness attributable to influenza. Physiologic changes associated 
with pregnancy, such as altered respiratory mechanics and 
changes in cell mediated immunity, might contribute to 
enhanced susceptibility (55). In a case-cohort study of 
1,873 pregnant women conducted over the 2010–11 and 
2011–12 seasons, among 292 women with acute respiratory 
illnesses, those with influenza reported greater symptom 
severity than those with noninfluenza acute respiratory illness 
(56). Case reports and some observational studies suggest that 
pregnancy increases the risk for hospitalization and serious 
maternal medical complications (57–59). Most of these studies 
have measured changes in excess hospitalizations or outpatient 
visits for respiratory illness during influenza season rather 
than LCI. A retrospective cohort study of pregnant women 
conducted in Nova Scotia during 1990–2002 compared 
medical record data for 134,188 pregnant women to data from 
the same women during the year before pregnancy. During the 
influenza seasons, the rate ratio of hospital admissions during 
the third trimester compared with admissions in the year before 
pregnancy was 7.9 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 5.0–12.5) 
among women with comorbidities and 5.1 (95% CI = 3.6–7.3) 
among those without comorbidities (59).
Increased severity of influenza among pregnant women was 
reported during the pandemics of 1918–1919, 1957–1958, 
and 2009–2010 (60–65). Severe infections among postpartum 
(delivered within previous 2 weeks) women also were observed 
in the 2009(H1N1) pandemic (60,64). In a case series 
conducted during the 2009(H1N1) pandemic, 56 deaths were 
reported among 280 pregnant women admitted to intensive 
care units. Among the deaths, 36 (64%) occurred in the third 
trimester. Pregnant women who were treated with antivirals 
>4 days after symptom onset were more likely to be admitted to 
an intensive care unit (57% versus 9%; relative risk [RR]: 6.0; 
95% CI = 3.5–10.6) than those treated within 2 days after 
symptom onset (66).
Some studies of pregnancy outcomes have suggested 
increased risk for pregnancy complications attributable to 
maternal influenza illness; others have not. A review of data 
from the National Inpatient Sample (a publicly available 
hospital discharge database; http://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/
nisoverview.jsp) covering the 1998–99 through the 2001–02 
seasons and including over 6.2 million hospitalizations of 
pregnant women, reported increased risk for fetal distress, 
preterm labor, and cesarean delivery among those women 
with respiratory illness during influenza seasons, compared 
with women without respiratory illness (67). A study 
of 117,347 pregnancies in Norway during the 2009–10 
pandemic noted an increased risk for fetal death among 
pregnant women with a clinical diagnosis of influenza 
(adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]: 1.91; 95% CI = 1.07–3.41) 
(68). A cohort study conducted among 221 hospitals in the 
United Kingdom observed an increased risk for perinatal 
death, stillbirth, and preterm birth among women admitted 
with confirmed 2009(H1N1) infection (69). However, other 
studies of infants born to women with LCI during pregnancy 
have not shown higher rates of prematurity, preterm labor, 
low birth weight, congenital abnormalities, or lower Apgar 
scores compared with infants born to uninfected women 
(70–72). A cohort study of 58,640 pregnant women enrolled 
in the Tennessee Medicare Program during the 1985–86 
through the 1992–93 seasons noted that pregnant women 
with respiratory hospitalizations during the influenza season 
had similar odds of preterm labor, prematurity, and low birth 
weight compared with pregnant women in a control group 
without an influenza hospitalization; modes of delivery and 
length of stay were also similar between the two groups (72).
Notably, influenza symptoms often include fever, which 
during pregnancy might be associated with neural tube 
defects and other adverse outcomes (73). A meta-analysis of 
22 observational studies of congenital anomalies following 
influenza exposure during the first trimester of pregnancy 
noted associations with several types of congenital anomalies, 
including neural tube defects, hydrocephaly, heart and aortic 
valve defects, digestive system defects, cleft lip, and limb 
reduction defects. However, many of the included studies 
were conducted during the 1950s through 1970s, and a 
nonspecific definition of influenza exposure was used (any 
reported influenza, ILI, or fever with influenza, with or without 
serological or clinical confirmation) (74). Additional studies are 
needed to further elucidate the association between influenza 
and congenital anomalies and other birth outcomes.
Persons with Increased Risk for Severe Influenza 
Illness and Complications
In the first U.S. recommendations for annual influenza 
vaccination, published by the Surgeon General in 1960, persons 
with “chronic debilitating diseases” (particularly cardiovascular 
disease, pulmonary disease, and diabetes) were cited as being 
among the groups contributing most to the excess deaths 
observed during the 1957 influenza pandemic (75). Persons 
with certain chronic medical conditions, in particular (but not 
limited to) chronic cardiovascular and pulmonary disease, have 
been observed to be at increased risk for severe influenza illness. 
In a study of 4,756 adults hospitalized with influenza from 
October 2005 through April 2008, characteristics significantly 
associated with pneumonia included underlying chronic lung 
 Recommendations and Reports

disease, asthma, and immunosuppression (76). Among patients 
with pneumonia, patients with a poor outcome (defined as 
ICU admission, need for mechanical ventilation, or death) 
were more likely to be affected by chronic lung disease, 
cardiovascular disease, renal disease, or immunosuppression. 
Observational studies have noted increased likelihood of 
hospitalization (77–79) and death (79,80) among persons 
with HIV infection.
Prior to the 2009 pandemic, obesity had not been recognized 
as a risk factor for severe influenza illness. However, several 
studies during the 2009 pandemic noted a high prevalence 
of obesity among persons with severe illness attributable to 
A(H1N1)pdm09 (81–83). In a case-cohort study, among 
persons aged ≥20 years, hospitalization with illness attributable 
to influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 was associated with extreme 
obesity (body mass index [BMI] ≥40) even in the absence 
of other risk factors for severe illness (odds ratio [OR]: 4.7; 
95% CI = 1.3–17.2) (84). Death was associated with both 
obesity, defined as BMI ≥30 (OR: 3.1; 95% CI = 1.5–6.6) and 
extreme obesity (OR: 7.6; 95% CI = 2.1–27.9). A Canadian 
cohort study covering 12 seasons (1996–97 through 2007–08) 
found that persons with a BMI of 30.0–34.9 and those with 
a BMI ≥35 were more likely than normal-weight persons to 
have a respiratory hospitalization during influenza seasons 
(OR: 1.45; 95% CI = 1.03–2.05 for BMI 30–34.9 and OR: 
2.12; 95% CI = 1.45–3.10 for BMI ≥35) (85). Conversely, 
a two-season study (2007–09) in the United States found 
no association between obesity and medically attended LCI, 
including both seasonal and pandemic virus circulation (86).
The 2009 pandemic also emphasized racial and ethnic 
disparities in the risk for influenza-related complications 
among adults, including higher rates of severe influenza illness 
among blacks and among American Indians/Alaska Natives 
and indigenous populations in other countries (87–92). These 
disparities might be attributable in part to the higher prevalence 
of underlying medical conditions or disparities in medical care 
among these racial/ethnic groups (92,93). A more recent case-
control study of risk factors for death from 2009 pandemic 
influenza that adjusted for factors such as pre-existing medical 
conditions, barriers to health care access, and delayed receipt 
of antivirals found that American Indian/Alaska Native status 
was not independently associated with death (94).
Influenza Vaccine Immunogenicity 
and Effectiveness
Estimates of vaccine efficacy (i.e., prevention of illness among 
vaccinated persons enrolled in controlled clinical trials) and 
vaccine effectiveness (i.e., prevention of illness in vaccinated 
populations) of influenza vaccines depend on many factors, 
including the age and immunocompetence of the vaccine 
recipient, the degree of similarity between the viruses in the 
vaccine and those in circulation, study design, diagnostic 
testing measures, and the outcome being measured. Studies of 
influenza vaccine efficacy and effectiveness have used a variety 
of outcome measures, including the prevention of ILI, medically 
attended acute respiratory illness (MAARI), LCI, P&I-associated 
hospitalizations or deaths, and prevention of seroconversion to 
circulating influenza virus strains. Efficacy or effectiveness for 
more specific outcomes such as LCI typically are higher than 
for less specific outcomes such as MAARI because the causes of 
MAARI include infections with other pathogens that influenza 
vaccination would not be expected to prevent (95).
Observational studies, particularly those that compare less-
specific outcomes among vaccinated populations to those 
among unvaccinated populations, are more subject to biases 
than studies using laboratory-confirmed outcomes. For example, 
an observational study that finds that influenza vaccination 
reduces overall mortality among elderly persons might be biased 
if healthier persons in the study are more likely to be vaccinated 
and thus less likely to die for any reason (96,97). Observational 
studies that use a case-positive, control test-negative study design 
(in which all participants present with illness, and case/control 
status is assigned on the basis of influenza testing) might be less 
subject to frailty bias (98).
For studies assessing laboratory-confirmed outcomes, 
estimates of vaccine efficacy and effectiveness also might 
be affected by the specificity of the diagnostic tests used. A 
2012 simulation study found that for each percentage point 
decrease in diagnostic test specificity for influenza virus 
infection, vaccine effectiveness would be underestimated 
by approximately 4% (99). Randomized controlled trials 
that measure LCI virus infections (by viral culture or reverse 
transcription polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR]) as the 
outcome are the most persuasive evidence of vaccine efficacy, 
but such data are not available for all populations.
A study of data from the National Inpatient Sample 
(a large database of hospital discharge data comprising 
approximately 8 million records annually from approximately 
1,000 hospitals, representing 46 states as of 2011) noted a 
decrease in the number of hospitalizations associated with P&I of 
295,000 (95% CI = 139,000–451,000) and a decrease of 13,600 
P&I-associated inpatient deaths (95% CI = 2,700–24,400) for 
October 2008 through December 2011, compared with what 
would have been expected on the basis of previous rates (100). 
This time period correlates with that of expansion of the target 
groups for annual influenza vaccination to include all persons 
aged ≥6 months. However, it is not possible to definitively 
attribute these decreases directly to increased vaccination.

Immune Response Following Vaccination
Humoral and cell-mediated responses to influenza vaccination 
among children and adults have been studied. Serum antibodies 
(10,101) are considered to be correlates of vaccine-induced 
protection for inactivated influenza vaccines (IIVs). Increased 
levels of antibody induced by vaccination decrease the risk for 
illness caused by strains that are antigenically similar to those 
strains of the same type or subtype included in the vaccine 
(11,102–104). Most healthy children and adults have high 
titers of strain-specific antibody after IIV vaccination (103,105). 
However, although immune correlates such as achievement 
of certain antibody titers after vaccination correlate well with 
immunity on a population level, reaching a certain antibody 
threshold (typically defined as a hemagglutination inhibition 
antibody or HAI titer of 32 or 40) might not predict protection 
from infection on the individual level.
Compared with IIV, LAIV induces lower levels of serum 
antibodies but induces cellular immune responses more 
effectively. The magnitude of this effect differs among adults 
and children. One study of children aged 6 months–9 years and 
adults aged 22–49 years noted a significant increase in influenza 
A-specific interferon γ-producing CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells 
among children following receipt of LAIV but not following 
receipt of IIV. No significant increase in these parameters was 
noted among adults following receipt of either vaccine (106).
Immune responses elicited by influenza vaccines are generally 
strain-specific. Antibody against one influenza virus type or 
subtype generally confers limited or no protection against 
another type or subtype, nor does it typically confer protection 
against antigenic variants of the same virus that arise by antigenic 
drift. However, among adults, vaccination can cause a “back 
boost” of antibody titers against influenza A(H3N2) viruses 
that have been encountered previously either by vaccination or 
natural infection (107).
Studies using a serological definition of influenza virus infection 
have raised concerns that dependence on a serological diagnosis 
of influenza in clinical trials might lead to overestimation of 
vaccine efficacy because of an “antibody ceiling” effect in adult 
participants with historic exposures to both natural infections 
and vaccination (108). This could result in the decreased 
likelihood that antibody increases can be observed in vaccinated 
participants after influenza infection with circulating viruses, 
as compared with adult participants in control arms of trials. 
Thus, vaccinated participants might be less likely to show a 
fourfold increase in antibody levels after influenza infection with 
circulating viruses compared with unvaccinated participants in 
such studies. Whether there is a substantial antibody ceiling 
effect in children, particularly younger children without 
extensive experience with influenza antigens, is not known.
Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness and Match 
Between Vaccine and Circulating Viruses
The viral composition of influenza vaccines must be 
determined months in advance of the start of each season, to 
allow enough time for manufacture and distribution of vaccine. 
Selection of viruses is based on consideration of global influenza 
surveillance data, from which decisions are made regarding 
the viruses most likely to circulate during the upcoming 
season. During some seasons, because of antigenic drift among 
influenza A viruses or change in predominant lineage among 
B viruses, circulating viruses might differ from those included 
in the vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccine effectiveness can 
be influenced by mismatches to circulating influenza viruses. 
Good match between vaccine and circulating viruses was 
associated with increased protection against MAARI-related 
ED visits and hospitalizations among older persons (109), ILI 
in younger working adults (49), and LCI (110) in observational 
studies. Results from other investigations suggest that influenza 
vaccine can still provide some protection against influenza and 
outcomes such as influenza-associated hospitalizations, even in 
seasons when match is suboptimal (111,112). In addition to 
antigenic drift of circulating influenza viruses, vaccine viruses 
might undergo adaptive mutations during propagation in eggs 
that also can contribute to an antigenic differences between 
vaccine virus and circulating viruses, which in some cases, has been 
suggested to contribute to reducing vaccine effectiveness (113).
Duration of Immunity
The composition of influenza vaccines is changed in most 
seasons, with one or more vaccine strains replaced annually 
to provide protection against viruses that are anticipated to 
circulate. Evidence from some clinical trials indicates that 
protection against viruses that are antigenically similar to 
those contained in the vaccine extends at least for 6–8 months, 
particularly in nonelderly populations. In some situations, 
duration of immunity might be longer, and such effects 
can be detected if circulating influenza virus strains remain 
antigenically similar for multiple seasons. For example, 
three years after vaccination with the A/Hong Kong/68 vaccine 
(i.e., the 1968 pandemic vaccine), effectiveness was 67% for 
prevention of influenza caused by the A/Hong Kong/68 virus 
(114). Serum HAI influenza antibodies elicited by vaccination 
remained detectable in children vaccinated with LAIV for 
>1 year after vaccination (115). In one community-based 
nonrandomized open-label trial, continued protection 
from MAARI during the 2000–01 influenza season was 
demonstrated in children who received only a single dose of 
LAIV3 during the previous season (116). A review of four

US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
trials (three randomized blinded and one open-label) of LAIV3 
conducted among young children aged 6 months through 
18 years reported that efficacy against A(H1N1) and A(H3N2) 
was similar at 9–12 months postvaccination to efficacy at 
1–<5 months postvaccination; for B strains, efficacy was still 
comparable at 5–7 months postvaccination. Two randomized 
trials and one open-label study reported residual efficacy 
through a second season without revaccination, albeit at lower 
levels than observed in the first season (117).
Several more recent observational studies have attempted 
to evaluate changes in influenza vaccine effectiveness over the 
course of a single influenza season. Some of these studies have 
noted a decrease in vaccine effectiveness, particularly against 
influenza A(H3N2) viruses, most markedly among older 
adults (118–121). However, this effect has not been observed 
consistently across age groups and seasons, and might be 
partially attributable to factors such as increased circulation of 
antigenically drifted variants over the course of the influenza 
season. These issues are discussed in more detail below (see 
Timing of Vaccination).
Immunogenicity, Efficacy, and 
Effectiveness of IIV
IIVs are administered by intramuscular or intradermal 
injection and contain nonreplicating virus. Immunogenicity, 
effectiveness, and efficacy have been evaluated in children 
and adults, although fewer data from randomized studies are 
available for certain age groups (e.g., persons aged ≥65 years). 
Since the introduction of quadrivalent IIV in the United 
States during the 2013–14 season, both trivalent (IIV3) and 
quadrivalent (IIV4) IIVs have been available. Both IIV3s and 
IIV4s contain an A(H1N1) virus, an A(H3N2) virus, and a 
B virus. IIV4s contain the viruses selected for IIV3s, and in 
addition contain a fourth virus, which is a B virus selected from 
the opposite lineage of that selected for IIV3s. Data directly 
comparing effectiveness of IIV3 versus IIV4 are not available. 
However, the U.S. Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Network 
found that IIV3 provided statistically significant protection 
against both the included B lineage (66%; 95% CI = 58–73) 
and the nonincluded B lineage (51%; 95% CI = 36–63) during 
the 2012–13 season when both lineages co-circulated (122). 
In general, prelicensure studies of immunogenicity of the 
currently licensed IIV4s compared with corresponding IIV3 
products (e.g., Fluzone Quadrivalent versus Fluzone, Fluarix 
Quadrivalent versus Fluarix, and Flulaval Quadrivalent versus 
Flulaval) demonstrated superior immunogenicity for IIV4 for 
the added influenza B virus without interfering with immune 
responses to the remaining three vaccine viruses (123–130).
Children
Children aged ≥6 months typically develop protective 
levels of antibodies against specific influenza virus strains 
after receiving the recommended number of doses of seasonal 
IIV (101,105,131–134). Immunogenicity studies using the 
A(H1N1)pdm09 monovalent vaccine indicated that 80%–
95% of vaccinated children developed protective antibody 
levels to the 2009 A(H1N1) influenza virus after 2 doses 
(135,136); response after 1 dose was 50% for children aged 
6–35 months and 75% for those aged 3–9 years (137).
Studies involving seasonal IIV among young children have 
demonstrated that 2 vaccine doses provide better protection 
than 1 dose during the first season a child is vaccinated. In a 
study during the 2004–05 season of children aged 5–8 years 
who received IIV3 for the first time, the proportion of 
children with protective antibody responses was significantly 
higher after 2 doses than after 1 dose of IIV3 for each 
antigen (p = 0.001 for influenza A[H1N1]; p = 0.01 for 
influenza A[H3N2]; and p = 0 0.001 for influenza B) (138). 
Vaccine effectiveness is lower among children aged <5 years 
who have never received influenza vaccine previously or who 
received only 1 dose in their first year of vaccination than it 
is among children who received 2 doses in their first year of 
being vaccinated. A retrospective study of billing and registry 
data among children aged 6–21 months conducted during 
the 2003–04 season found that although receipt of 2 doses 
of IIV3 was protective against office visits for ILI, receipt of 
1 dose was not (139). Another retrospective cohort study of 
children aged 6 months through 8 years, the majority of whom 
received IIV3 (0.8% received LAIV3), also conducted during 
the 2003–04 season, found no effectiveness against ILI among 
children who had received only 1 dose (140). In a case-control 
study of approximately 2,500 children aged 6–59 months 
conducted during the 2003–04 and 2004–05 seasons, being 
fully vaccinated (having received the recommended number of 
doses) was associated with 57% effectiveness (95% CI = 28–74) 
against LCI for the 2004–05 season; a single dose was not 
significantly effective (too few children in the study population 
were fully vaccinated during the 2003–04 season to draw 
conclusions) (141). The results of these studies support the 
recommendation that all children aged 6 months–8 years who 
are being vaccinated for the first time should receive 2 doses 
separated by at least 4 weeks (see Children Aged 6 Months 
Through 8 Years).
Estimates of the efficacy of IIV among children aged 
≥6 months vary by season and study design. Limited efficacy 
data are available for children from studies that used culture- 
or RT-PCR–confirmed influenza virus infections as the 
primary outcome. A large randomized trial compared rates

of RT-PCR–confirmed influenza virus infections among 
4,707 children aged 6–71 months who received IIV3, IIV3 
with MF59 adjuvant (aIIV3; not currently licensed for children 
in the United States), or a control vaccine (meningococcal 
conjugate vaccine or tickborne encephalitis vaccine). During 
the two seasons of the study (2007–08 and 2008–09), efficacy 
of IIV3 versus control vaccine was 43% (95% CI = 15–61). 
Efficacy of aIIV3 versus control was 86% (95% CI = 74–93) 
(142). In a randomized trial conducted during five influenza 
seasons (1985–90) in the United States among children aged 
1–15 years, receipt of IIV3 reduced culture-positive influenza 
by 77% (95% CI = 20–93) during A(H3N2) years and 91% 
(95% CI = 64–98) during A(H1N1) years (103). A single-
season placebo-controlled study that enrolled 192 healthy 
children aged 3–19 years found the efficacy of IIV3 was 56% 
(p<0.05) among those aged 3–9 years and 100% among 
those aged 10–18 years (143); influenza infection was defined 
either by viral culture or by a postseason antibody rise in 
HI titer among symptomatic children from whom no other 
virus was isolated. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled trial conducted during two influenza seasons 
among 786 children aged 6–24 months, estimated efficacy was 
66% (95% CI = 34–82) against culture-confirmed influenza 
illness during 1999–2000. However, vaccination did not 
reduce culture-confirmed influenza illness significantly during 
2000–2001, when influenza attack rates were lower (3% versus 
16% during 1999–2000 season) (144).
Receipt of IIV was associated with a reduction in acute otitis 
media in some studies but not in others. Two studies reported 
that IIV3 decreases the risk for otitis media among children 
(145,146). However, a randomized, placebo-controlled trial 
conducted among 786 children aged 6 through 24 months 
(mean age: 14 months) indicated that IIV3 did not reduce 
the proportion of children who developed acute otitis media 
during the study (144). Influenza vaccine effectiveness against 
a nonspecific clinical outcome such as acute otitis media, 
which is caused by a variety of pathogens and typically is not 
diagnosed by use of influenza virus detection methods, would 
be expected to be lower than effectiveness against LCI.
Younger Adults
One dose of IIV tends to be immunogenic in healthy adults 
aged <65 years. A 2012 meta-analysis found a pooled IIV3 
efficacy against RT-PCR or culture-confirmed influenza of 
59% (95% CI = 51–67) among adults aged 18–65 years for 
eight of twelve seasons analyzed in 10 randomized controlled 
trials (147). Vaccination of healthy adults was associated with 
decreased work absenteeism and use of health care resources 
in some studies, when the vaccine and circulating viruses are 
well-matched (49,148). In another study of healthy working 
adults conducted during the 2012–13 season, no significant 
difference in missed work hours between vaccinated and 
unvaccinated subjects was noted (149).
Older Adults
Older adults have long been recognized as a high-risk group 
for severe influenza illness, and have been recommended to 
receive annual influenza vaccination since the 1960s (75). 
Historically, most effectiveness data in this population pertain 
to standard-dose IIVs, which contain 15 µg of HA of each 
vaccine virus per dose. Discussion of the more recently licensed 
high-dose IIV3 occurs below.
Most studies suggest that antibody responses to influenza 
vaccination are decreased in older adults. It is likely that 
increasing dysregulation of the immune system with aging 
contributes to the increased likelihood of serious complications 
of influenza infection (150). A review of HAI antibody 
responses to IIV3 in 31 studies found that 42%, 51%, and 35% 
of older adults (aged ≥58 years) seroconverted to A(H1N1), 
A(H3N2), and B vaccine antigens, respectively, compared with 
60%, 62%, and 58% of younger persons (aged <58 years) 
(151). When seroprotection (defined as an HAI titer ≥40) 
was the outcome, 69%, 74%, and 67% of older adults versus 
83%, 84%, and 78% of younger adults achieved protective 
titers to A(H1N1), A(H3N2), and B antigens, respectively. 
Although an HAI titer ≥40 is considered to be associated 
with approximately 50% clinical protection from infection, 
this standard was established in young healthy adults (11), 
and few data suggest that such antibody titers represent a 
correlate of protection among elderly adults. An analysis of 
serologic data from a randomized controlled efficacy trial of 
high-dose IIV among the elderly found that an HAI titer of 
≥40 corresponded to 50% protection (similar to the recognized 
threshold for younger adults) when the assay virus was well-
matched to the circulating virus but higher titers were required 
with poor match (152). Limited or no increase in antibody 
response is reported among elderly adults when a second dose 
is administered during the same season (153–155).
Most data concerning vaccine effectiveness among 
community-dwelling older adults comes from observational 
studies. One randomized controlled trial conducted among 
community-dwelling persons aged ≥60 years found IIV3 to 
be 58% effective (95% CI = 26–77) against serologically 
confirmed influenza illness during the 1991–92 season, 
during which vaccine viruses were considered to be well-
matched to circulating strains (156). The outcome used 
for measuring the efficacy estimate was seroconversion 
to a circulating influenza virus and symptomatic illness 
compatible with clinical influenza infection, rather than 
viral culture or PCR-confirmed influenza infection. Use

of such outcomes raises concern that seroconversion after 
symptomatic illness will be less likely among vaccinated 
persons who have higher levels of pre-existing anti-HA 
antibody that than among those not vaccinated, leading 
to an overestimate of the true vaccine efficacy. This 
phenomenon was demonstrated in a clinical trial conducted 
among healthy adults aged 18 through 49 years (108).
Other evidence of effectiveness of influenza vaccines 
among older adults is derived from observational studies and 
from analyses of health care system data. A 2010 Cochrane 
review of influenza vaccine effectiveness studies among 
community-dwelling persons aged ≥65 years pooled data 
from 75 studies (randomized, quasi-randomized, cohort, 
and case-control studies) to assess efficacy against LCI or 
ILI (157). IIV3 was not significantly effective against LCI, 
ILI, or pneumonia. The quality of the pooled evidence was 
rated as generally low because of the paucity of randomized 
clinical trials. A different team of investigators subsequently 
performed a meta-analysis of these data, but using a different 
stratification method and examining a smaller number of 
clinically relevant outcomes. Using these methods, the authors 
estimated vaccine effectiveness for LCI of approximately 49% 
(95% CI = 33–62), and for ILI of 39% (95% CI = 35–43) 
(158). A more recent systematic review, published in 2014, 
included pooled data from 35 test-negative design case-
control studies involving community-dwelling elderly. This 
review concluded that although influenza vaccine was not 
significantly effective during periods of localized influenza 
activity (defined as cases limited to one administrative 
unit of a country or reported from a single site), influenza 
vaccine was effective against LCI irrespective of vaccine 
match or mismatch to the circulating viruses during regional 
(OR: 0.42; 95% CI = 0.30–0.60 when matched; OR 0.57; 
95% CI = 0.41–0.79 when not matched) and widespread 
outbreaks (OR: 0.54; 95% CI = 0.46–0.62 when matched; 
OR 0.72; 95% CI = 0.60–0.85 when not matched), although 
the effect was stronger when the vaccine matched (159). 
Vaccine was effective during sporadic activity, but only when 
vaccine matched (OR: 0.69; 95% CI = 0.48–0.99).
Influenza vaccination might reduce the frequency of 
secondary complications and risk for influenza-related 
hospitalization and death among community-dwelling adults 
aged ≥65 years with and without high-risk medical conditions 
(160–164). However, these studies have been conducted using 
medical record databases and did not use reductions in LCI 
illness as an outcome of interest. Such methods have been 
challenged because results might not be adjusted adequately to 
control for the possibility that healthier persons might be more 
likely to be vaccinated than less healthy persons (96,97,165–
168). In a study of medical record data on influenza-associated 
hospitalizations associated with two A(H3N2) outbreaks 
in 1982–1983 and 1985–1986, vaccination was associated 
with a reduction in P&I hospitalizations among those aged 
≥65 years (37% [95% CI = 15–53] in 1982–1983 and 39% 
[95% CI = 19–53] in 1985–1986) (169). A test-negative case-
control study of community-dwelling adults aged ≥65 years 
noted that receipt of 2010–11 seasonal influenza vaccine 
was associated with a 42% reduction (95% CI = 29–53) in 
hospitalizations for LCI. When analyzed by type/subtype, the 
reduction was 40% (95% CI = 26–52) for influenza A(H3N2) 
and 90% (95% CI = 51–98) for influenza A(H1N1); no benefit 
was seen against influenza B (13%; 95% CI = -77–58) (170). 
A seven-season study (2002–03 through 2008–09) found 
that in every season, vaccinated elderly participants were 
significantly less likely to be hospitalized for P&I compared 
with unvaccinated persons (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] ranged 
from 0.67 to 0.86 over the seven seasons; p<0.001 to <0.030); 
no significant decrease was observed in the risk for outpatient 
visits (171). Several studies using methods to account 
for unmeasured confounding have reported that among 
community-dwelling older persons for nonspecific serious 
outcomes such as P&I hospitalizations or all-cause mortality 
is ~10% or less, which is more plausible than higher estimates 
from earlier studies (172–174).
Influenza infection is a common cause of morbidity and 
death among institutionalized older adults. Influenza vaccine 
effectiveness in preventing respiratory illness among elderly 
persons residing in nursing homes has been estimated at 
20%–40% (175,176). A Cochrane review of 64 studies 
demonstrated that vaccination was more effective for persons 
living in institutional settings than for community-dwellers 
(177). However, documented outbreaks among well-vaccinated 
nursing-home populations suggest that vaccination might not 
have discernable effectiveness, particularly when circulating 
strains are drifted from vaccine strains (178,179).
The desire to improve immune response and vaccine 
effectiveness among adults aged ≥65 years has led to the 
development and licensure of vaccines intended to promote a 
better immune response in this population. Currently, both a 
high-dose IIV3 and an aIIV3 are licensed for this age group, 
in addition to standard-dose unadjuvanted IIV3 and IIV4. 
The only currently licensed high-dose IIV, Fluzone High-
Dose (Sanofi Pasteur, Swiftwater, Pennsylvania), is licensed for 
persons aged ≥65 years and has been available since the 2010–11 
influenza season. It is a trivalent formulation containing 60 µg 
of HA of each vaccine virus per dose, compared with 15 µg of 
each vaccine virus per dose in standard-dose IIVs. Licensure 
was based on superior immunogenicity compared with 
standard-dose IIV in this age group. Immunogenicity data from 
three studies of high-dose IIV3 among persons aged ≥65 years

indicated that vaccine with four times the HA antigen content 
of standard-dose vaccine elicited substantially higher HAI titers 
(180–182). Prespecified criteria for superiority in one clinical 
trial study was defined by a lower bound of the 95% CI for 
the ratio of geometric mean HI titers of >1.5, and a lower 
bound of the 95% CI for the difference in seroconversion rates 
(fourfold rise of HI titers) of >10%. These criteria were met for 
influenza A(H1N1) and influenza A(H3N2) virus antigens, 
but not for the influenza B virus antigen (for which criteria 
for noninferiority were met) (181,183). Subsequently, a large 
randomized comparative efficacy trial of high-dose versus 
standard-dose IIV3 conducted among over 31,000 persons 
aged ≥65 years over the 2011–12 and 2012–13 influenza 
seasons found 24.2% greater relative efficacy of the high-dose 
IIV3 for protection against LCI caused by any viral type or 
subtype associated with protocol-defined ILI (184).
A second vaccine licensed specifically for this age group, 
Fluad (Seqirus, Holly Springs, North Carolina), is an 
MF59-adjuvanted trivalent IIV (aIIV3). This new vaccine is 
anticipated to be available for the 2016–17 season. Further 
information is provided below (see Recently Licensed Influenza 
Vaccine Products).
Pregnant Women and Neonates
IIV induces protective levels of antibody in pregnant women 
(185). Passive transfer of anti-influenza antibodies from 
vaccinated women to neonates has been documented (185–
187). In a randomized controlled trial conducted in Bangladesh, 
vaccination of pregnant women during the third trimester 
resulted in a 36% reduction in respiratory illness with fever 
among these women, as compared with women who received 
pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine. In addition, influenza 
vaccination of mothers was 63% effective (95% CI = 5–85) 
in preventing LCI in their breastfed infants during the first 6 
months of life (188). A randomized placebo-controlled trial 
of IIV3 among HIV-infected and uninfected women in South 
Africa reported efficacy against RT-PCR–confirmed influenza 
of 50.4% (95% CI = 14.5–71.2) among the HIV-uninfected 
mothers and 48.8% (95% CI = 11.6–70.4) among their infants 
(189). In a matched case-control study of infants admitted to 
a large urban hospital in the United States during 2000–2009, 
investigators found that maternal vaccination was associated 
with significantly lower likelihood of hospitalization for LCI 
among infants aged <6 months (91.5%; 95% CI = 61.7–98.1) 
(190). A prospective cohort study among Native Americans 
reported that infants aged <6 months of vaccinated mothers 
had a 41% reduction of the risk for LCI in the inpatient and 
outpatient settings (RR: 0.59; 95% CI = 0.37–0.93) and a 39% 
reduction in risk for ILI-associated hospitalization (RR: 0.61; 
95% CI = 0.45–0.84) (191). In a study of 1,510 infants aged 
<6 months, those of vaccinated mothers were less likely to be 
hospitalized with LCI than those of nonvaccinated mothers 
(aOR: 0.55; 95% CI = 0.32–0.95) (192).
Persons with Chronic Medical Conditions
Because of the long-standing recommendation for annual 
influenza vaccination of persons with chronic medical 
conditions, there are relatively few published studies 
describing the efficacy of inactivated influenza vaccines 
among populations with specific high-risk conditions. 
In the pediatric literature, most published studies of this 
nature focus on asthma. In a nonrandomized controlled 
trial during the 1992–93 season involving 137 children 
who had moderate to severe asthma, vaccine efficacy against 
laboratory-confirmed influenza A(H3N2) infection was 54% 
among children aged 2 through 6 years and 78% among 
children aged ≥7 through 14 years; vaccine efficacy against 
laboratory-confirmed influenza B infection was 60% among 
children aged ≥7 through 14 years, but nonsignificant for 
the younger age group (193). In a two-season study of 
349 asthmatic children, IIV3 vaccine was associated with 
a 55% reduction in the occurrence of ARI in children aged 
<6 years (95% CI = 20–75; p = 0.01), but no association 
was noted among children aged 6 through 12 years (194).
The association between vaccination and prevention of 
asthma exacerbations is unclear. A retrospective uncontrolled 
cohort study based on medical and vaccination records 
during three seasons (1993–94 through 1995–96) found 
that asthmatic children aged 1 through 6 years showed an 
association between receipt of IIV3 and reduced rates of 
exacerbations in two out of three seasons (195). In a study 
of 80 asthmatic children aged 3–18 years, current influenza 
vaccination status was associated with a significant reduction 
(OR: 0.29, 95% CI = 0.10–0.84) in oral steroid use in the 
12 months before the survey (196). Other studies have failed 
to show any benefit against asthma exacerbation (197,198).
A small study evaluated immune response to IIV3 among 
asthmatic children who were receiving prednisone for asthma 
exacerbation symptoms. Among 109 children aged 6 months 
through 18 years, 59 of whom had no asthma symptoms and 
50 of whom were symptomatic and required prednisone, 
no difference was noted in antibody response to A(H1N1) 
and A(H3N2) following receipt of IIV3. Response to the 
B component of the vaccine was significantly better in the 
prednisone group (199).
There is some evidence to suggest that vaccine effectiveness 
among adults aged <65 years with chronic medical conditions 
might be lower than that reported for healthy adults. In a 
case-control study conducted during the 2003–04 influenza 
season, when the vaccine was a suboptimal antigenic match

to many circulating virus strains, effectiveness for prevention 
of LCI (tests used were not specified) illness among adults 
aged 50–64 years with high-risk conditions was 48% 
(95% CI = 21–66) compared with 60% (95% CI = 43–72) 
for healthy adults. For influenza-related hospitalizations, 
effectiveness varied more substantially by risk status: among 
those with high-risk conditions, vaccine effectiveness was 36% 
(95% CI = 0–63) whereas it was 90% (95% CI = 68–97) 
among healthy adults (200).
Some observational studies have found large reductions 
in hospitalizations or deaths for adults with chronic medical 
conditions. For example, in a case-control study conducted 
during 1999–2000 in the Netherlands among 24,928 persons 
aged 18 through 64 years with underlying medical conditions, 
vaccination was reported to reduce deaths attributable to any 
cause by 78% and reduce hospitalizations attributable to acute 
respiratory or cardiovascular diseases by 87%. (201). Among 
patients with diabetes mellitus, vaccination was associated with 
a 56% reduction in any complication, a 54% reduction in 
hospitalizations, and a 58% reduction in deaths (202). Effects 
of this magnitude on nonspecific outcomes are likely to have 
been caused by confounding from unmeasured factors (e.g., 
dementia and difficulties with self-care) that are associated 
strongly with the measured outcomes (96,97).
A randomized controlled trial conducted among 125 adults in 
Thailand with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 
observed that vaccine efficacy was 76% (95% CI = 32–93) 
in preventing influenza-associated acute respiratory infection 
(defined as respiratory illness associated with HAI titer 
increase and/or positive influenza antigen on indirect 
immunofluorescence testing) during a season when circulating 
influenza viruses were well-matched to vaccine viruses (203). A 
systematic review of studies of influenza vaccine among COPD 
patients identified evidence of reduced risk for exacerbation 
from vaccination (204). Eleven trials were included but only 
six of these were specifically performed in COPD patients. The 
others were conducted on elderly and high-risk persons, some of 
whom had chronic lung disease. However, a systematic review 
that focused on studies of adults and children with asthma 
concluded that evidence was insufficient to demonstrate benefit 
of vaccination in this population (205).
Evidence suggests that acute respiratory infections might 
trigger atherosclerosis-related acute vascular events (206). 
Some studies have attempted to evaluate the impact of 
vaccination on such events. Several randomized controlled 
trials have suggested protective efficacy of influenza vaccination 
against vascular events. The FLUVACS study randomized 
participants with known coronary artery disease to IIV3 or 
placebo and followed up at 6 months, 1 year and 2 years. 
Vaccination was associated with lower cardiovascular mortality 
(RR: 0.25; 95% CI = 0.07-0.86 at 6 months and RR: 0.34; 
95% CI = 0.17–0.71 at 1 year) and lower risk for a composite 
endpoint including cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial 
infarction, or severe ischemia (RR: 0.50; 95% CI = 0.29-0.85 
at 6 months and 0.59; 95% CI = 0.40–0.86 at 1 year) 
compared with controls (207,208). In the FLUCAD study, 
a randomized trial of 658 participants with coronary artery 
disease, rates of coronary ischemic events at 12 months were 
significantly lower in the vaccinated group (hazard ratio 
[HR]: 0.54; 95% CI = 0.29–0.99) (209). Another composite 
endpoint, major CV events (including cardiovascular death, 
myocardial infarction, or coronary revascularization) was not 
significantly different between vaccinated and placebo groups. 
In a trial of 439 participants with acute coronary syndrome, 
influenza vaccination resulted in a significant reduction of 
major coronary adverse events (adjusted HR [aHR]: 0.67; 
95% CI = 0.51–0.86), but not cardiovascular death (0.62; 
95% CI = 0.34–1.12) (210). A pooled analysis of these data 
with those of the FLUVACS study showed a significant 
reduction of major cardiovascular events (pooled effectiveness 
44%; 95% CI = 25–58), cardiovascular deaths (pooled 
effectiveness: 60%; 95% CI = 29–78); and hospitalization 
(pooled effectiveness 51%; 95% CI = 16–72) in vaccinated 
participants at one-year follow up (211). A self-controlled case 
series study conducted through medical record review of over 
17,000 persons aged ≥18 years who had experienced a stroke 
found a reduction of 55% in the risk for stroke in the first 
1–3 days after vaccination; subsequent reductions were 36% 
at 4–7 days, 30% at 8–14 days, 24% at 15–28 days, and 17% 
at 29–59 days (212).
Statin medications, a class of drugs commonly used 
among persons with vascular disease, are known to have 
immunomodulatory effects. A posthoc analysis of data from 
a randomized clinical trial comparing MF59-adjuvanted 
IIV3 and unadjuvanted IIV3 among persons aged ≥65 years 
demonstrated lower geometric mean titers following vaccination 
among persons receiving chronic statin therapy (by 38% 
[95% CI = 27–50] for A(H1N1), by 67% [95% CI = 54–80] 
for A(H3N2), and by 38% [95% CI = 28–49] for B). The 
effect was more pronounced among those receiving synthetic 
statin drugs (fluvastatin, atorvastatin, and rosuvastatin) relative 
to those receiving fermentation-derived statins (pravastatin, 
simvastatin, lovastatin, and Advicor) (213). A retrospective 
cohort study covering nine influenza seasons found reduced 
effectiveness of influenza vaccine against MAARI among statin 
users (214); however, this study did not evaluate confirmed 
influenza illness. Further study of the specific impact of statins 
on influenza vaccine effectiveness is needed.
Multiple studies indicate that vaccination might be 
beneficial for persons with chronic liver disease. A prospective

study of 311 persons with cirrhosis, 198 of whom received 
IIV3 and the remainder of whom were unvaccinated, noted 
reduction in the rates of ILI (14% versus 23%; p = 0.064) and 
of culture-positive influenza (2.3% versus 8.8%; p = 0.009) 
in the vaccinated group (215). Review of data from Taiwan’s 
National Health Insurance program from 2000 through 
2009 noted a lower hospitalization rate among persons 
with chronic hepatitis B infection who had been vaccinated 
compared with those who had not (16.29 versus 24.02 per 
1,000 person-years) (216).
Studies of the immunogenicity and effectiveness of seasonal 
influenza vaccine among persons with obesity have shown 
conflicting results. An evaluation of immunogenicity of 
influenza vaccine conducted among pregnant and postpartum 
women reported that seroconversion rates among obese women 
were lower than those among normal-weight participants, 
but the difference was not statistically significant (217). Two 
other observational studies focused on the impact of obesity 
on postvaccination immune response. One study comparing 
1-month and 12-month postvaccination immune response 
showed that obese persons mounted a vigorous initial antibody 
response to IIV3 (218). However, higher BMI was associated 
with a decline in influenza antibody titers after 12 months 
postvaccination. A second study of older adults reported that 
immunogenicity of IIV3 was similar in obese and normal-
weight older adults, with a slight increase in seroconversion 
for the A/H3N2 virus but not for the other viruses (219). 
In a small study involving 51 children aged 3–14 years with 
varying BMI measurements (220), seroprotection rates at 
4 weeks postvaccination were significantly higher against 
influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 strain in the overweight/obese 
group (p<0.05) when compared with the normal-weight 
group. This difference diminished over time, with the antibody 
response similar or slightly higher in overweight/obese children 
when measured 4 months postvaccination. A test-negative 
case-control study of hospitalized adult patients reported an 
unadjusted vaccine effectiveness against LCI hospitalizations of 
79% (95% CI = -6– 96); after adjusting for obesity, the vaccine 
effectiveness estimate increased to 86% (95% CI = 19–97); the 
presence of obesity increased the odds of laboratory-confirmed 
influenza by 2.8 times (221).
Immunocompromised Persons
In general, HIV-infected persons with minimal AIDS-related 
symptoms and normal or near-normal CD4+ T-lymphocyte 
cell counts who receive IIV develop adequate antibody 
responses (222–224). Among persons who have advanced HIV 
disease and low CD4+ T-lymphocyte cell counts, IIV might 
not induce protective antibody titers (224,225); a second dose 
of vaccine does not improve immune response (225,226). In 
an investigation of an influenza A outbreak at a residential 
facility for HIV-infected persons, vaccine was most effective 
at preventing ILI among persons with >100 CD4+ cells and 
among those with <30,000 viral copies of HIV type-1/mL 
(227). In a randomized placebo-controlled trial conducted 
in South Africa among 506 HIV-infected adults, including 
349 persons on antiretroviral treatment and 157 who were 
antiretroviral treatment-naïve, efficacy of IIV3 for prevention 
of culture- or RT-PCR–confirmed influenza illness was 75% 
(95% CI = 9–96) (228).
In a randomized study comparing the immunogenicity 
of high-dose versus standard-dose IIV3 among 195 HIV-
infected adults aged ≥18 years (10% of whom had CD4 
counts under 200 cells/µL), seroprotection rates were higher 
in the high-dose group for A(H1N1) (96% versus 87%; 
p = 0.029) and influenza B (91% versus 80%; p = 0.030). 
Both vaccines were well-tolerated (229). However, in a 
comparative study of 41 children and young adults aged 
3–21 years with cancer or HIV infection, high-dose IIV3 
was no more immunogenic than standard-dose IIV3 among 
the HIV-infected recipients (230).
Several observational studies suggest that immunogenicity 
among persons with solid organ transplants varies according 
to factors such as transplant type, time from transplant, and 
varying immunosuppressive regimen. Overall seroprotective 
and seroconversion responses have ranged from 15% to 93% 
with lower responses seen in lung transplant and greater 
responses several years after kidney transplant (231). In one 
study, kidney transplant recipients who were 3–10 years 
posttransplant had a 93% seroprotection rate to A(H1N1) 
antigen after vaccination (232). Among persons with kidney 
or heart transplants, seroresponse rates were similar or slightly 
reduced compared with healthy persons (232–237). However, 
a small study involving participants with liver transplants 
indicated a reduced immunologic response to influenza 
vaccinations (238). Response rates were lowest if vaccination 
occurred within the four months after the transplant 
procedure (239). A study of persons with a history of kidney 
transplant found that influenza vaccination in the first year 
after transplant was associated with a lower rate of transplant 
rejection (aHR: 0.77; 95% CI = 0.69–0.85; p<0.001) and 
death (0.82; 95% CI = 0.76–0.89; p<0.001) (240).
Immunogenicity, Efficacy, and 
Effectiveness of LAIV
LAIV virus strains replicate in nasopharyngeal epithelial cells. 
The protective mechanisms induced by vaccination with LAIV 
are not understood completely but appear to involve both 
serum and nasal secretory antibodies, as well as cell-mediated

immune responses. The immunogenicity of LAIV3 has been 
assessed in multiple studies (241–245).
The single LAIV licensed in the United States was originally 
a trivalent vaccine (FluMist; MedImmune, Gaithersburg, 
Maryland). FluMist Quadrivalent was licensed by FDA in 
2012, and replaced the trivalent formulation beginning with 
the 2013–14 season. Prelicensure studies comparing LAIV4 
to LAIV3 demonstrated that HAI antibody responses to 
LAIV4 were noninferior to responses to LAIV3 among healthy 
children and adults ≤49 years (246–248). LAIV4 might confer 
increased protection against seasonal influenza B by targeting 
more than one influenza B lineage. No comparative efficacy 
or effectiveness data for LAIV4 versus LAIV3 are available.
LAIV3 in Children
A large randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial 
among 1,602 healthy children aged 15–71 months assessed 
the efficacy of LAIV3 against culture-confirmed influenza 
during two seasons (1996–98) (249,250). During the first 
season, when vaccine and circulating virus strains were well-
matched, efficacy against culture-confirmed influenza was 94% 
(95% CI = 88–97) for participants who received 2 doses of 
LAIV3 separated by >6 weeks, and 89% (95% CI = 65–96) 
for those who received 1 dose (249). During the second 
season, when the A(H3N2) component in the vaccine was 
not well-matched with circulating virus strains, efficacy for 
1 dose was 86% (95% CI = 75–92) for this virus. The overall 
efficacy for any influenza during the two seasons was 92% 
(95% CI = 88–94) (250). In a randomized placebo-controlled 
trial comparing 1 dose versus 2 doses of LAIV3 in 3,200 vaccine-
naïve children aged 6–35 months in South Africa, Brazil, and 
Argentina during the 2001 and 2002 seasons, efficacy was 
57.7% (95% CI = 44.7–67.9) after 1 dose of LAIV3 and 73.5% 
(95% CI = 63.6–81) after 2 doses (251) during the first year of 
the study. Other two-season, randomized, placebo-controlled 
trials have demonstrated similar efficacy rates of LAIV3 among 
young children, ranging from 85% to 89% among children in 
childcare (252) to 64% to 70% for children in eight regions 
in Asia (253). LAIV3 efficacy in preventing LCI also has been 
demonstrated in studies comparing the efficacy of LAIV with 
IIV rather than with a placebo (see Comparisons of LAIV3/4 
and IIV Efficacy or Effectiveness).
Effectiveness studies have demonstrated that LAIV3 use 
among healthy children was associated with reduced risk 
of outcomes other than LCI. In one community-based, 
nonrandomized open-label study, reductions in MAARI were 
observed during the 2000–01 season among children who 
received 1 dose of LAIV3 during 1999–2000 or 2000–2001), 
even though antigenically drifted influenza A(H1N1) and 
B viruses were circulating during the latter season (116). 
Receipt of LAIV3 resulted in 21% fewer febrile illnesses 
(95% CI = 11–30) and 30% fewer febrile otitis media 
(95% CI = 18–45) (249). A meta-analysis of six placebo-
controlled studies concluded that the effectiveness of LAIV3 
against acute otitis media associated with culture-confirmed 
influenza among children aged 6–83 months was 85% 
(95% CI = 78–90) (254).
LAIV3 in Younger Adults
A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 
LAIV3 effectiveness among 4,561 healthy working adults aged 
18 through 64 years assessed multiple endpoints, including 
reductions in self-reported respiratory tract illness without 
laboratory confirmation, work loss, health care visits, and 
medication use during influenza outbreak periods. The study 
was conducted during the 1997–98 influenza season, when 
the vaccine and circulating A(H3N2) viruses were not well-
matched. The frequency of febrile illnesses was not significantly 
decreased among LAIV3 recipients compared with those who 
received placebo. However, vaccine recipients had significantly 
fewer severe febrile illnesses (19% reduction) and febrile upper 
respiratory tract illnesses (24% reduction); and significant 
reductions in days of illness, days of work lost, days with health 
care provider visits, and use of prescription antibiotics and over-
the-counter medications (255). Estimated efficacy of LAIV3 
against influenza confirmed by either culture or RT-PCR in a 
randomized, placebo-controlled study among approximately 
1,200-2,000 young adults was 48% (95% CI = -7–74) in 
the 2004–05 influenza season, 8% (95% CI = -194–67) in 
the 2005–06 influenza season, and 36% (95% CI = 0–59) in 
the 2007–08 influenza season; efficacy in the 2004–05 and 
2005–06 seasons was not significant (256–258).
Comparisons of LAIV3/4 and IIV Efficacy or 
Effectiveness
Studies comparing the efficacy of IIV3 to that of LAIV3 
among adults have been conducted in a variety of settings and 
populations using several different outcomes. Among adults, 
most comparative studies demonstrated that LAIV3 and 
IIV3 have similar efficacy, or that IIV3 was more efficacious 
(259). One randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
challenge study that was conducted among 92 healthy adults 
aged 18–45 years assessed the efficacy of both LAIV3 and IIV3 
in preventing influenza infection when artificially challenged 
with wild-type strains that were antigenically similar to vaccine 
strains (245). The overall efficacy in preventing laboratory-
documented influenza illness (defined as respiratory symptoms 
with either isolation of wild-type influenza virus from nasal 
secretions or fourfold and/or greater HAI antibody response to 
challenge) from all three influenza strains combined was 85%

for LAIV3 and 71% for IIV3 when study participants were 
challenged 28 days after vaccination by viruses to which they 
were susceptible before vaccination. The difference in efficacy 
between the two vaccines was not statistically significant in this 
small study (245). In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled trial conducted among young adults during the 
2004–05 influenza season, when the majority of circulating 
A(H3N2) viruses were antigenically drifted from that season’s 
vaccine viruses, the efficacy of LAIV3 and IIV3 against culture-
confirmed influenza was 57% (95% CI = -3–82) and 77% 
(95% CI = 37–92), respectively. The difference in efficacy 
was not statistically significant and was attributable primarily 
to a difference in efficacy against influenza B (256). Similar 
studies conducted among adults during the 2005–06 and 
2007–08 influenza seasons found no significant difference 
in vaccine efficacy in the 2005–06 season (257) but did find 
a 50% relative efficacy of IIV3 compared with LAIV3 in the 
2007–08 season (258). An observational study conducted 
among military personnel aged 17–49 years over the 2004–05, 
2005–06, and 2006–07 influenza seasons indicated that 
persons who received IIV3 had a significantly lower incidence 
of health care encounters resulting in diagnostic coding for P&I 
compared with those who received LAIV3 (adjusted incidence 
rate ratio [aIRR]: 0.57 [95% CI = 0.51–0.64] for the 2004–05 
season, 0.79 [95% CI = 0.72–0.87] for the 2005–06 season, 
and 0.80 [95% CI = 0.74–0.86] for the 2006–07 season) (260). 
However, in a retrospective cohort study comparing LAIV3 
and IIV3 among 701,753 nonrecruit military personnel and 
70,325 new recruits, among new recruits, incidence of ILI 
was lower among those who received LAIV3 than IIV3. The 
previous vaccination status of the recruits was not stated; it is 
possible that this population was relatively naïve to vaccination 
compared with previous service members who were more likely 
to have been vaccinated routinely each year (261).
Several studies comparing LAIV3 with IIV3 prior to the 
2009 pandemic demonstrated superior efficacy of LAIV3 
among young children (259). A randomized controlled trial 
conducted among 7,852 children aged 6–59 months during 
the 2004–05 influenza season demonstrated a 55% reduction 
in cases of culture-confirmed influenza among children who 
received LAIV3 compared with those who received IIV3 (262). 
In this study, LAIV3 efficacy was higher compared with IIV3 
against antigenically drifted viruses and well-matched viruses. 
An open-label, nonrandomized, community-based influenza 
vaccine trial conducted among 7,609 children aged 5–18 years 
during an influenza season when circulating A(H3N2) strains 
were poorly matched with strains contained in the vaccine 
also indicated that LAIV3, but not IIV3, was effective against 
antigenically drifted A(H3N2) viruses. In this study, children 
who received LAIV3 had significant protection against LCI 
(37%) and P&I events (50%) (263). LAIV3 provided 32% 
increased protection in preventing culture-confirmed influenza 
compared with IIV3 in one study conducted among children 
aged ≥6 years and adolescents with asthma (264) and 52% 
increased protection compared with IIV3 among children aged 
6–71 months with recurrent respiratory tract infections (265).
On the basis of these data, in June 2014, ACIP recommended 
that when immediately available, LAIV should be used 
for healthy children aged 2 through 8 years who have no 
contraindications or precautions. However, analysis of 
data from three observational studies of LAIV4 vaccine 
effectiveness for the 2013–14 season (the first season in which 
LAIV4 was available) revealed low effectiveness of LAIV4 
against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 among children aged 2 
through 17 years (266,267). Analysis of data from the U.S. 
Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Network for the 2010–11 
through 2013–14 seasons noted that children aged 2 through 
17 years who received LAIV had similar odds of influenza 
regardless of receipt of LAIV3 or IIV3 during 2010–11 
through 2012–13; however, during the 2013–14 season odds 
of influenza were significantly higher for those who received 
LAIV4 (OR: 5.36; 95% CI = 2.37–12.13 for children aged 2 
through 8 years; OR: 2.88; 95% CI = 1.62–5.12 for children 
aged 2 through 17 years) (268). During this season, the 
H1N1pdm09 virus predominated for the first time since 
the 2009 pandemic. The diminished effectiveness against 
H1N1pdm09 was hypothesized to be attributable to reduced 
stability and infectivity of the A/California/2009/(H1N1) 
vaccine virus, conferred by a single amino acid mutation in 
the stalk region of the HA protein (269). Moreover, although 
one large randomized trial observed superior relative efficacy 
of LAIV3 compared with IIV3 against antigenically drifted 
H3N2 influenza viruses during the 2004–05 season (262), 
analysis of observational data from the U.S. Influenza Vaccine 
Effectiveness Network for the early 2014–15 season (in 
which antigenically drifted H3N2 viruses were predominant) 
indicated that neither LAIV4 nor IIV provided significant 
protection in children aged 2 through 17 years; LAIV4 did not 
offer greater protection than IIV for these viruses (270). Based 
on these influenza vaccine effectiveness data for the 2013–14 
and 2014–15 seasons, ACIP concluded that a preference of 
LAIV4 over IIV was no longer warranted (6).
For the 2015–16 season, to address stability concerns 
surrounding the A/California/7/2009(H1N1) HA, HA from 
a different influenza A(H1N1) virus was included in LAIV4 
(A/Bolivia/559/2013(H1N1). In June 2016, ACIP reviewed 
data pertaining to effectiveness of LAIV4 and IIV in the United 
States for the 2015–16 season (271). During this season, in 
which A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were predominant, analysis of 
data from the U.S. Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Network

showed no significant vaccine effectiveness among children 
aged 2 through 17 years for LAIV4 for all influenza A and B 
viruses combined (3%; 95% CI = -49–37) or for influenza 
A(H1N1)pdm09 (-21%; 95% CI = -108–30). A Department 
of Defense analysis similarly noted no statistically significant 
vaccine effectiveness of LAIV4 against influenza A(H1N1) 
in this age group for the 2015–16 season. Data presented by 
MedImmune to ACIP on June 22, 2016 included a somewhat 
higher point estimate for LAIV4 effectiveness against influenza 
A(H1N1) (50%), but this value was not statistically significant. 
Conversely, estimated effectiveness of IIV against these viruses 
among children aged 2 through 17 years was significant across 
all three studies. Following review of this information in June 
2016, ACIP made the interim recommendation that LAIV4 
should not be used for the 2016–17 influenza season.
Immunogenicity, Efficacy, and 
Effectiveness of RIV
RIV, available as a trivalent vaccine, Flublok (RIV3; Protein 
Sciences, Meriden, Connecticut) was licensed by FDA in 2013. 
This vaccine contains 135 µg of purified HA proteins (45 µg 
for each virus). The HA proteins are produced in an insect cell 
line; this process uses neither live influenza viruses nor eggs.
As a relatively new product, fewer postmarketing effectiveness 
data are available for RIV3 than IIVs. Initial licensure was for 
persons aged 18 through 49 years. In prelicensure studies 
comparing RIV3 versus placebo among persons aged 18 
through 49 years, serum antibody responses were induced 
to all three vaccine components (272). In a randomized 
placebo-controlled study conducted among healthy persons 
aged 18 through 49 years during the 2007–08 influenza 
season (273,274), estimated vaccine effectiveness for CDC-
defined ILI with a positive culture for influenza virus was 
75.4% (95% CI = -148.0–99.5) against matched strains; more 
precise estimation of vaccine effectiveness was not possible 
because 96% of isolates in this study did not antigenically 
match the strains represented in the vaccine (273). Estimated 
vaccine effectiveness without regard to match was 44.6% 
(95% CI = 18.8–62.6) (274).
Although RIV3 was licensed initially for use in persons 
aged 18 through 49 years, in October 2014, the approved age 
indication was expanded to ≥18 years on the basis of data from 
randomized trials demonstrating adequate immunogenicity 
among persons aged ≥50 years (275,276); effectiveness data 
are not yet available for this age group.
Safety of Influenza Vaccines
Safety of Inactivated Influenza Vaccines
Children
A large postlicensure population-based study assessed IIV3 
safety in 251,600 children aged <18 years (including 8,476 
vaccinations in children aged 6–23 months) enrolled in one 
of five health care organizations within the Vaccine Safety 
Datalink (VSD; http://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/activities/
vsd.html) during 1993–1999. This study indicated no increase 
in clinically important medically attended events during the 
2 weeks after IIV administration compared with control periods 
2–4 weeks before and after vaccination (277). In a retrospective 
cohort study using VSD data from 45,356 children aged 
6–23 months during 1991–2003, IIV3 was not associated with 
statistically significant increases in any clinically important 
medically attended events other than gastritis/duodenitis 
during the 2 weeks after vaccination compared with control 
time periods before and after vaccination. Most vaccinated 
children with a diagnosis of gastritis/duodenitis had self-limited 
vomiting or diarrhea. Several diagnoses, including acute upper 
respiratory illness, otitis media and asthma, were significantly 
less common during the 2 weeks after influenza vaccination. 
Although there was a temporal relationship with vaccination, 
the vaccine did not necessarily cause or prevent these conditions 
(278). A subsequent VSD study of 66,283 children aged 
24–59 months noted diagnoses of fever, gastrointestinal tract 
symptoms, and gastrointestinal disorders to be significantly 
associated with IIV3. Upon medical record review, none of 
the events appeared to be serious, and none was associated 
with complications (279).
In a study of 791 healthy children aged 1 through 15 years, 
postvaccination fever was noted among 12% of those aged 
1 through5 years, 5% among those aged 6 through10 years, 
and 5% among those aged 11 through 15 years (103). Fever, 
malaise, myalgia, and other systemic symptoms that can occur 
after vaccination with IIV3 most often affect persons who have 
had no previous exposure to the influenza virus antigens in 
the vaccine (e.g., young children) (280). These reactions are 
generally self-limited and subside after 1–2 days.
Studies conducted during the 1970s of monovalent and 
bivalent whole-virus influenza vaccines demonstrated greater 
reactogenicity among young children as compared with older

children and adults (133,281–283). These findings were the 
basis for the recommendation that children aged 6 through 
35 months receive half the dose of IIV (0.25 cc) compared 
with older children and adults. Whole virus IIVs are no longer 
available in the United States, having been replaced with 
split-virus and subunit IIVs. As a group, the newer IIVs are 
less reactogenic than the previous whole-virus products (284). 
A multisite randomized controlled trial comparing full-dose 
(0.5 mL) IIV3 with half-dose (0.25 mL) IIV3 in children aged 
6 through35 months reported no significant differences in local 
or systemic reactions (285).
Febrile seizures are not uncommon in young children. At 
least one febrile seizure is experienced by 2%–5% of children 
aged 6–60 months; nearly all children who have a febrile 
seizure recover quickly and are healthy afterward (286). Prior 
to the 2010–11 influenza season, an increased risk for febrile 
seizures following receipt of IIV3 had not been observed in 
the United States (278,287). During the 2010–11 influenza 
season, CDC and FDA conducted enhanced monitoring for 
febrile seizures following receipt of influenza vaccines after 
reports of an increased risk for fever and febrile seizures (up to 
nine febrile seizures per 1,000 vaccine doses) in young children 
in Australia associated with a 2010 Southern Hemisphere IIV3 
produced by CSL Biotherapies (now Seqirus) (288). Because 
of the findings in Australia, ACIP does not recommend the 
U.S.-licensed Seqirus IIV3, Afluria, for children aged <9 years 
(Table 1).
Surveillance among children receiving U.S.-licensed influenza 
vaccines during the 2010–11 influenza season subsequently 
detected safety concerns for febrile seizures in young children 
following receipt of IIV3 (289,290). Further assessment 
through a VSD study determined that risk for febrile seizures 
was increased in children aged 6 months–4 years from the day 
of vaccination until the day after (risk window: day 0–1). The 
risk was higher when children received concomitant PCV13 
(i.e., when the two vaccines are administered at the same health 
care visit) and peaked at approximately age 16 months (290). 
The magnitude of the increased risk for febrile seizures in 
children aged 6–23 months in the United States observed in 
this study (<1 per 1,000 children vaccinated) was substantially 
lower than the risk observed in Australia in 2010 (288). 
Findings from surveillance for febrile seizures in young children 
following influenza vaccine for the 2011–12 season, which 
had the same formulation as that of the 2010–11 season, were 
consistent with the 2010–11 season. An observational clinical 
study also showed that risk for fever in the 0–1 days after 
vaccination was higher when young children received 2011–12 
IIV3 and PCV13 concomitantly versus receipt of IIV3 or 
PCV13 without the other product (291). An increased risk 
for febrile seizures following receipt of IIV3 was not observed 
during the 2012–13 season (CDC, unpublished data, 2013) 
(292). After evaluating the data on febrile seizures from the 
2010–11 season and taking into consideration benefits and 
risks of vaccination, ACIP recommended no policy change 
for use of IIV (293,294). A subsequently published analysis 
of data from the 2010–11 season reported that there was no 
association between receipt of IIV3 (adjusted for concomitant 
PCV13 or DTaP) and febrile seizures (IRR adjusted for age and 
seasonality: 1.36; 95% CI = 0.78–2.39) (295). Same-day IIV3 
and PCV13 vaccination was not associated with more febrile 
seizures compared with separate-day vaccination (1.08 fewer 
febrile seizures per 100,000 with same day administration; 
95% CI = -5.68–6.09). However, a VSD study of data from 
the 2013–14 and 2014–15 seasons found an elevated risk for 
febrile seizures among 6- through 23 month-olds 0–1 days 
after concomitant receipt of IIV3 and PCV13 (RR: 5.30; 
95% CI = 1.87–14.75). There was no significant increased 
risk following administration of IIV3 without PCV13 (296). 
Surveillance for febrile seizures following receipt of IIVs is 
ongoing through the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System 
(VAERS; https://vaers.hhs.gov/index), and VSD conducts near 
real-time sequential monitoring for seizures following receipt 
of IIV during the influenza season.
Since the 2013–14 season, in addition to previously available 
IIV3s, several IIV4 formulations have been licensed. IIV4s 
include products licensed for children as young as age 6 months. 
In prelicensure studies of IIV4s, overall frequencies of most 
solicited adverse events were similar to the corresponding 
comparator IIV3s (297–299). Most local and general adverse 
events are temporary and mild to moderate in severity. Among 
children, the most common safety complaint was a modest 
increase in injection-site pain (124,126,128,300). The first 
postlicensure review of VAERS reports covering the 2013–14 
and 2014–15 seasons noted that the most common adverse 
events reported following receipt of IIV4 among children aged 
6 months through 17 years were injection-site reactions and 
fever. No specific safety concerns were identified; the safety 
profile was similar to that of IIV3 (301).
Adults
In placebo-controlled studies of IIV3 among older adults, 
the most frequent side effect of vaccination was soreness at the 
vaccination site (affecting 10%–64% of patients) that lasted 
<2 days (302,303). These local reactions typically were mild 
and rarely interfered with the recipients’ ability to conduct 
usual daily activities. Placebo-controlled trials demonstrate that 
among older persons and healthy young adults, administration 
of IIV3 is not associated with higher proportions of systemic 
symptoms (e.g., fever, malaise, myalgia, and headache) 
when compared with placebo injections (302–304). Adverse

events in adults aged ≥18 years reported to VAERS during 
1990–2005 were analyzed (305). The most common adverse 
events for adults described in 18,245 VAERS reports included 
injection-site reactions, pain, fever, myalgia, and headache. The 
VAERS review identified no new safety concerns. Fourteen 
percent of the IIV3 VAERS reports in adults were classified 
as serious adverse events (defined as those involving death, 
life-threatening illness, hospitalization or prolongation of 
hospitalization, or permanent disability) (306), similar to 
proportions seen in VAERS for other adult vaccines. The most 
common serious adverse event reported after IIV3 in VAERS in 
adults was Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) (see Guillain-Barré 
Syndrome and IIV). However, VAERS cannot assess whether 
a vaccine caused an event to occur.

US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Injection-site reactions and systemic adverse events were 
more frequent after vaccination with high-dose IIV3 (Fluzone 
High-Dose; Sanofi Pasteur, Swiftwater, Pennsylvania), which 
contains 180 µg of HA antigen (60 for each vaccine virus) than 
after vaccination with standard dose IIV3 (45 µg) (Fluzone; 
Sanofi Pasteur, Swiftwater, Pennsylvania), but were typically 
mild and transient. In one study, 915 (36%) of 2,572 persons 
who received Fluzone High-Dose, compared with 306 (24%) 
of 1,262 who received Fluzone, reported injection-site pain. 
Only 1.1% of Fluzone High Dose recipients reported moderate 
to severe fever, but this was significantly higher than the 0.3% 
of Fluzone recipients who reported this systemic adverse 
event (RR: 3.6; 95% CI = 1.3–10.1) (181). A randomized 
study of high-dose versus standard-dose vaccine including 
9,172 participants found no difference in occurrence of 
serious adverse events or several specific adverse events of 
interest (including GBS, Bell’s Palsy, encephalitis/myelitis, 
optic neuritis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal 
necrolysis) (307). Safety monitoring of high-dose vaccine in 
VAERS during the first year after licensure indicated a higher-
than-expected number of gastrointestinal events compared 
with standard-dose vaccine, but otherwise no new safety 
concerns were identified. Most of the reported gastrointestinal 
events were nonserious (308). CDC and FDA will continue 
to monitor the safety of high-dose vaccine through VAERS.
Fewer postmarketing safety data have thus far accumulated 
for IIV4, which first became available during the 2013–14 
season, compared with IIV3. Among adults the most 
common safety complaints were injection-site pain and 
systemic reactions, such as myalgia, headaches, and fatigue 
(123,125,127,129,130,309). The first postlicensure safety 
assessment of VAERS reports covering the 2013–14 and 
2014–15 seasons noted a safety profile similar to that of IIV3. 
The most common adverse event reported following receipt of 
IIV4 among adults aged 18 through 64 years was injection-site 
pain. No specific safety concerns were identified (301).
Intradermal IIV, which was available as an IIV3 for the 
2011–12 through 2014–15 seasons and as an IIV4 since 
2015–16, has been observed to be associated with increased 
frequency of some injection-site reactions as compared with 
intramuscularly administered IIV. In a randomized study 
of intradermal IIV3 versus intramuscular IIV3 among 
approximately 4,200 adults aged 18–64 years, erythema, 
induration, swelling, and pruritus occurred with greater 
frequency following receipt of intradermal vaccine compared 
with intramuscular vaccine (310); frequency of injection-
site pain was not significantly different. A review of studies 
comparing intradermal and intramuscular IIV3 similarly noted 
higher rates of erythema, induration, swelling, and pruritus 
among adults aged 18–60 years within the first 7 days after 
receiving intradermal vaccine; local pain and ecchymosis and 
systemic reactions occurred with similar frequency (311). A 
review of VAERS reports covering the 2011–12 and 2012–13 
seasons, the first two seasons that the intradermal IIV3 was 
available, revealed no new safety concerns (312). A randomized 
study comparing safety of the newer IIV4 with that of IIV3 
revealed a similar adverse event profile (130).
Cell culture-based IIV3 (ccIIV3), licensed by FDA in 2013, 
appears to have a similar safety profile to other, previously 
licensed IIVs. A review of 629 VAERS reports related to ccIIV3 
during the 2013–14 and 2014–15 seasons noted that injection-
site and systemic symptoms were the most commonly reported 
adverse effects; no concerning pattern of adverse effects was 
identified (313). ACIP will continue to review safety data 
pertaining to cell culture based vaccines.
An MF59-adjuvanted IIV3 (aIIV3), Fluad (Seqirus, Holly 
Springs, North Carolina), approved in November 2015 for 
use in persons aged ≥65 years, will be available during the 
2016–17 season. In clinical trials among persons in this age 
group, some local and systemic adverse events were observed 
to occur more frequently following aIIV3 compared with 
unadjuvanted IIV; most were mild in severity. The safety 
profile of MF59-adjuvanted IIV3 compares favorably to that 
of unadjuvanted IIV (314).
Pregnant Women and Neonates
Currently available IIVs are classified as either Pregnancy 
Category B or Category C† medications, depending on 
whether adequate animal reproduction studies have been 
conducted. Available data indicate that influenza vaccine does 
not cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. 
However, data on the safety of influenza vaccination in the 
early first trimester are limited (315). A matched case-control 
study of 252 pregnant women who received IIV3 within the 
6 months before delivery determined that no serious adverse 
events occurred after vaccination and that no difference in 
pregnancy outcomes was identified among these pregnant 
women compared with 826 pregnant women who were not 
vaccinated (316). A case-control analysis of data from six 
health care organizations participating in VSD found no 
significant increase in the risk for pregnancy loss in the 4 weeks 
following seasonal influenza vaccination during the 2005–06 
† Pregnancy Category B indicates that 1) animal reproduction studies have failed 
to demonstrate a risk to the fetus and there are no adequate and well-controlled 
studies in humans or 2) animal studies have shown an adverse effect, but 
adequate and well-controlled studies in humans have failed to demonstrate a 
risk to the fetus in any trimester. Pregnancy Category C indicates that animal 
reproduction studies have shown an adverse effect on the fetus and there are 
no adequate and well-controlled studies in humans, but potential benefits might 
warrant use of the drug in pregnant women despite potential risks. Additional 
information about pregnancy categories is available at https://www.gpo.gov/

US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
and 2006–07 seasons (317). A review of health registry data 
in Norway noted an increased risk for fetal death associated 
with influenza A(H1N1) pdm09 infection, but no increased 
risk for fetal mortality associated with vaccination (68). During 
1990–2009, VAERS reports of pregnant women after receipt 
of IIV3 did not find any new, unusual, or unexpected pattern 
of adverse pregnancy events or fetal outcomes (318).
Background rates of spontaneous abortion vary from 10.4% 
in women aged <25 years to 22.4% in women aged >34 years 
(319); considering the number of pregnant women vaccinated, 
miscarriage following (but not attributable to) influenza 
vaccination would not be an unexpected event. Preliminary (as 
yet unpublished) results of a VSD study suggested an increased 
risk for spontaneous abortion in some pregnant women in the 
1 to 28 days after receiving IIV3 during either the 2010–11 
or the 2011–12 seasons; the increased risk was seen primarily 
in women who had also received a H1N1pdm09-containing 
vaccine in the previous season (320). A systematic review and 
meta-analysis of seven published observational studies (four 
involving unadjuvanted A[H1N1]pdm09 monovalent vaccine, 
two involving adjuvanted A[H1N1]pdm09 monovalent 
vaccine, and one involving A/New Jersey/8/76 monovalent 
vaccine) found decreased risk for stillbirth among women who 
were vaccinated (for all studies, RR: 0.73; 95% CI = 0.55–0.96; 
for studies of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccines RR: 0.69; 
95% CI = 0.52–0.90); there was no significant difference 
in risk for spontaneous abortion between vaccinated and 
unvaccinated women (RR: 0.91; 95% CI = 0.68–1.22) (321). 
Several reviews of studies involving seasonal and 2009(H1N1) 
IIV in pregnancy concluded that no evidence exists to suggest 
harm to the fetus from maternal vaccination (322–324).
A systematic review and meta-analysis of studies of 
congenital anomalies after vaccination including data from 
15 studies (14 cohort studies and one case-control study), 
eight of which reported data on first-trimester immunization 
showed that risk for congenital malformations was similar for 
vaccinated and unvaccinated mothers: in the cohort studies, 
events per vaccinated versus unvaccinated were 2.6% versus 
3.1% (5.4% versus 3.3% for the subanalysis involving first-
trimester vaccination); in the case-control study, the percentage 
vaccinated among cases versus controls was 37.3% versus 
41.7% (325). There was no association between congenital 
defects and influenza vaccination in any trimester (OR: 0.96; 
95% CI = 0.86–1.07) or specifically in the first trimester 
(OR: 1.03; 95% CI = 0.91–1.18). With respect to major 
malformations, there was no increased risk after immunization 
in any trimester (OR: 0.99; 95% CI = 0.88–1.11) or in the first 
trimester (OR: 0.98; 95% CI = 0.83–1.16). In a retrospective 
cohort study of 57,554 women, influenza vaccination was not 
associated with increased or decreased risk for preterm birth 
or small for gestational age birth (326).
Ocular and Respiratory Symptoms After Receipt 
of IIV
Oculorespiratory syndrome (ORS), an acute, self-limited 
reaction to IIV, was first described during the 2000–01 
influenza season in Canada (327,328). The initial case-
definition for ORS was the onset of one or more of the 
following within 2–24 hours after receiving IIV3, and resolving 
within 48 hours of onset: red eyes, cough, wheeze, chest 
tightness, difficulty breathing, sore throat, or facial swelling 
(327,329). ORS was initially noted to be associated with one 
vaccine preparation (Fluviral S/F; Shire Biologics, Quebec, 
Canada) not available in the United States during the 2000–01 
influenza season (327). After changes in the manufacturing 
process of the vaccine preparation associated with ORS during 
the 2000–01 season, the incidence of ORS in Canada was 
reduced greatly (330).
The cause of ORS has not been established; however, 
studies suggest that the reaction is not IgE-mediated (331). 
When assessing whether a patient who experienced ocular and 
respiratory symptoms should be revaccinated, providers should 
determine if concerning signs and symptoms of IgE-mediated 
immediate hypersensitivity are present (see Immediate 
Hypersensitivity Reactions After Receipt of Influenza 
Vaccines). Health care providers who are unsure whether 
symptoms reported or observed after receipt of IIV represent 
an IgE-mediated hypersensitivity immune response should 
seek advice from an allergist/immunologist. Persons who have 
had red eyes, mild upper facial swelling, or mild respiratory 
symptoms (e.g., sore throat, cough, or hoarseness) after 
receipt of IIV without other concerning signs or symptoms of 
hypersensitivity can receive IIV in subsequent seasons without 
further evaluation. Two studies indicated that persons who had 
symptoms of ORS after receipt of IIV were at a higher risk 
for ORS after subsequent IIV administration; however, these 
events usually were milder than the first episode (332,333).
Guillain-Barré Syndrome and IIV
Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) is an autoimmune disease 
associated with rapid-onset muscle weakness. Evidence exists 
that multiple infectious illnesses, most notably Campylobacter 
jejuni gastrointestinal infections and upper respiratory tract 
infections, are associated with GBS (334–336). The annual 
incidence of GBS is 10–20 cases per 1 million adults (337). An 
analysis of 405 patients admitted to a single facility identified 
an association between serologically confirmed influenza virus 
infection and GBS, with time from onset of influenza illness 
to GBS of 3–30 days (338).
 Recommendations and Reports

MMWR / August 26, 2016 / Vol. 65 / No. 5
US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
The 1976 swine influenza vaccine was associated with an 
increased frequency of GBS, estimated at one additional 
case of GBS per 100,000 vaccinated persons. The risk for 
influenza vaccine–associated GBS was higher among persons 
aged ≥25 years than among persons aged <25 years (339). No 
subsequent study conducted using influenza vaccines other 
than the 1976 swine influenza vaccine has demonstrated an 
increase in GBS associated with influenza vaccines on the order 
of magnitude seen in the 1976–77 season (340,341).
During three of four influenza seasons studied during 1977–
1991, the overall relative risk estimates for GBS after influenza 
vaccination were not statistically significant (342–344). 
However, in a study of the 1992–93 and 1993–94 seasons, 
the overall relative risk for GBS was 1.7 (95% CI = 1.0–2.8; 
p = 0.04) during the 6 weeks after vaccination, representing 
approximately one additional case of GBS per 1 million 
persons vaccinated. GBS cases peaked 2 weeks after vaccination 
(341). Results of a study that examined health care data from 
Ontario, Canada, during 1992–2004 demonstrated a small but 
statistically significant temporal association between receiving 
influenza vaccination and subsequent hospital admission for 
GBS (relative incidence: 1.45; 95% CI = 1.05–1.99). However, 
no increase in cases of GBS at the population level was reported 
after introduction of a mass public influenza vaccination 
program in Ontario beginning in 2000 (345). Published data 
from the United Kingdom’s General Practice Research Database 
(GPRD) found influenza vaccination to be associated with a 
non-statistically significant decreased risk for GBS (OR: 0.16; 
95% CI = 0.02–1.25), although whether this was associated 
with protection against influenza or confounding because of a 
“healthy vaccinee” effect (i.e., healthier persons might be more 
likely to be vaccinated and also be at lower risk for GBS) is 
unclear (346). A separate GPRD analysis found no association 
between vaccination and GBS for a 9-year period; only three 
cases of GBS occurred within 6 weeks after administration 
of influenza vaccine (347). A third GPRD analysis found 
that GBS was associated with recent ILI, but not influenza 
vaccination (348). A meta-analysis of 39 observational studies 
of seasonal and 2009 pandemic influenza vaccines published 
between 1981 and 2014 found an overall relative risk for 
GBS of 1.41 (95% CI = 1.20–1.66); the risk was higher for 
pandemic vaccines (RR: 1.84; 95% CI = 1.36–2.50) than for 
seasonal vaccines (RR: 1.22; 95% CI = 1.01–1.48) (349).
The estimated risk for GBS (on the basis of the few studies 
that have demonstrated an association between seasonal IIV and 
GBS) is low: approximately one additional case per 1 million 
persons vaccinated (341). In addition, data from the systems 
monitoring influenza A(H1N1) 2009 monovalent vaccines 
suggest that the increased risk for GBS is approximately one 
or two additional cases per 1 million persons vaccinated, 
which is similar to that observed in some years for seasonal 
IIV (350–356). Studies have also shown an increased risk for 
GBS following influenza infection, of higher magnitude than 
the risk observed following influenza vaccination (338,357).
Persons with a history of GBS have a substantially greater 
likelihood of subsequently experiencing GBS than persons 
without such a history (337). Thus, the likelihood of 
coincidentally experiencing GBS after influenza vaccination 
is expected to be greater among persons with a history of 
GBS than among persons with no history of this syndrome. 
Whether influenza vaccination specifically might increase the 
risk for recurrence of GBS is unknown. Among 311 patients 
with GBS who responded to a survey, 11 (4%) reported some 
worsening of symptoms after influenza vaccination; however, 
some of these patients had received other vaccines at the same 
time, and recurring symptoms were generally mild (358). In a 
Kaiser Permanente Northern California database study among 
>3 million members conducted over an 11-year period, no cases 
of recurrent GBS were identified after influenza vaccination 
in 107 persons with a documented prior diagnosis of GBS, 
two of whom had initially developed GBS within 6 weeks of 
influenza vaccination (359).
As a precaution, persons who are not at high risk for severe 
influenza complications (see Persons at Risk for Medical 
Complications Attributable to Severe Influenza) and who 
are known to have experienced GBS within 6 weeks of 
influenza vaccination generally should not be vaccinated. 
As an alternative to vaccination, physicians might consider 
using influenza antiviral chemoprophylaxis for these persons. 
However, the benefits of influenza vaccination might outweigh 
the risks for certain persons who have a history of GBS and who 
also are at high risk for severe complications from influenza.
Thimerosal
Thimerosal, an ethyl mercury-containing antimicrobial 
compound, is used in multidose vial preparations of IIV to reduce 
the likelihood of microbial growth that might occur if organisms 
are introduced via the needle and syringe. Although accumulating 
evidence shows no increased risks from exposure to vaccines 
containing thimerosal (360–370), the U.S. Public Health Service 
and other organizations have recommended that efforts be made 
to eliminate or reduce the thimerosal content in vaccines as part of 
a strategy to reduce mercury exposures from all sources (360,361). 
LAIV, RIV, and most single-dose vial or syringe preparations of 
IIV do not contain thimerosal. Persons recommended to receive 
IIV may receive any age- and risk factor–appropriate vaccine 
preparation, depending on availability.

Persons at Higher Risk for Influenza-Related 
Complications
Overall, safety data pertaining to persons with specific 
underlying conditions are more limited that pertaining to 
healthy populations. A study of 52 children aged 6 months 
through 4 years with chronic lung disease or congenital heart 
disease reported fever among 27% and irritability and insomnia 
among 25% (131); and a study among 33 children aged 
6–18 months with bronchopulmonary dysplasia or congenital 
heart disease reported that one child had irritability and one 
had a fever and seizure after vaccination (284). No placebo 
comparison group was used in these studies. One prospective 
cohort study found that the rate of adverse events was similar 
among hospitalized persons who were aged either ≥65 years 
or 18–64 years and who had one or more chronic medical 
conditions compared with outpatients; injection-site soreness 
was the most common complaint (371).
Several randomized clinical trials comparing IIV to placebo 
among persons with COPD reported safety outcomes. A study 
of 125 COPD patients at a Thai hospital clinic reported that 
significantly more patients in the vaccine group had local 
reactions (27% versus 6% placebo; p = 0.002) (372). The 
most common local reactions among vaccinated patients 
were swelling, itching and pain when touched. The duration 
was usually <48 hours and did not require specific treatment. 
There were no significant differences between the two groups 
in systemic reactions, such as headache, myalgia, fever, skin 
rash, nor in lung function, dyspneic symptoms, and exercise 
capacity at one week and at 4 weeks.
IIV is safe and well tolerated in asthmatic children (373) and 
adults (205). A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled crossover trial involving 2,032 asthmatic subjects 
aged 3–64 years found a similarly high frequency of asthma 
exacerbations during the 2 weeks following either vaccination 
or placebo injection (28.8% versus 27.7%). Only myalgia was 
reported more frequently following IIV3 (25% versus 21% 
placebo; p<0.001) (374). A randomized study of IIV3 versus 
placebo among 262 asthmatic adults noted that vaccination was 
associated with a decline in peak expiratory flow; however, this 
effect was no longer significant when adjusted for the presence of 
concomitant symptomatic cold symptoms (375). A randomized 
crossover design study of IIV3 versus saline placebo showed no 
significant difference in the occurrence of asthma exacerbations 
during the 14 days postvaccination (376).
Immunocompromised Persons
Data demonstrating safety of IIV3 for HIV-infected 
persons are limited, but no evidence exists that vaccination 
has a clinically important impact on HIV infection 
or immunocompetence. Although some earlier studies 
demonstrated a transient increase in replication of HIV-1 in the 
plasma or peripheral blood mononuclear cells of HIV-infected 
persons after vaccine administration (224,377,378), better-
designed studies have not documented a substantial increase 
in replication (379–382). CD4+ T-lymphocyte cell counts or 
progression of HIV disease have not been demonstrated to 
change substantially after influenza vaccination among HIV-
infected persons compared with unvaccinated HIV-infected 
persons (383). Limited information is available about the 
effect of antiretroviral therapy on increases in HIV RNA levels 
after either influenza virus infection or influenza vaccination 
(384,385).
IIV generally has been shown to be well-tolerated in both 
adult and pediatric solid organ transplant recipients (231). In 
small studies, IIV vaccination did not affect allograft function 
or cause acute rejection episodes in recipients of kidney 
(232,233,386), heart (234), lung (386) or liver transplants 
(238,239,387) A literature review concluded that there is 
no convincing epidemiologic link between vaccination and 
allograft dysfunction (231). A single case of Guillain-Barré 
syndrome in a liver transplant recipient and another case of 
rhabdomyolysis leading to acute allograft dysfunction after IIV 
vaccination have been reported (388,389). Several case reports 
of corneal graft rejection have been reported following receipt 
of IIV (390–392), but no studies demonstrating an association 
have been conducted.
Safety of LAIV
Shedding, Transmission, and Phenotypic Stability 
of LAIV Viruses
Children and adults vaccinated with LAIV can shed vaccine 
viruses after vaccination, although in lower amounts than 
occur typically with shedding of wild-type influenza viruses. 
Studies assessing shedding of vaccine virus have been based on 
viral cultures or RT-PCR detection of vaccine viruses in nasal 
aspirates from LAIV recipients. A study of 345 participants 
aged 5–49 years who received LAIV3 and for whom shedding 
was assessed by viral culture of nasal swabs (daily for days 
1–7 postvaccination, every other day for days 9 through 25, 
and on day 28) indicated that 30% had detectable virus in 
nasal secretions obtained by nasal swabbing. The duration 
of virus shedding and the amount of virus shed was inversely 
correlated with age, and maximal shedding occurred within 
2 days of vaccination. Symptoms reported after vaccination, 
including runny nose, headache, and sore throat, did not 
correlate with virus shedding (393). Other smaller studies have 
reported similar findings (394,395). In an open-label study of 
 Recommendations and Reports
24 
MMWR / August 26, 2016 / Vol. 65 / No. 5
US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
200 children aged 6–59 months who received a single dose 
of LAIV3, shedding of at least one vaccine virus was detected 
on culture in 79% of children, and was more common among 
the younger recipients (89% of children aged 6–23 months 
compared with 69% of children aged 24–59 months) (396). 
The incidence of shedding was highest on the second day 
postvaccination. Mean duration of shedding was 2.8 days 
(3.0 and 2.7 days for the younger and older age groups, 
respectively); shedding detected after 11 days postvaccination 
was uncommon and nearly all instances occurred among 
children aged 6–23 months (an age group for which LAIV is 
not licensed). Titers of shed virus were low (396). Vaccine virus 
was detected from nasal secretions in one (2%) of 57 HIV-
infected adults who received LAIV3 compared with none 
of 54 HIV-negative participants (397), and in three (13%) 
of 24 HIV-infected children compared with seven (28%) of 
25 children who were not HIV-infected (398).
Rarely, shed vaccine viruses can be transmitted from vaccine 
recipients to unvaccinated persons. However, serious illnesses 
have not been reported among unvaccinated persons who have 
been infected inadvertently with vaccine viruses. One study of 
197 children aged 9–36 months in a child care center assessed 
the potential for transmission of LAIV3 vaccine viruses from 
98 vaccinated children to 99 unvaccinated children; 80% 
of vaccine recipients shed one or more virus strains (mean 
duration: 7.6 days). One influenza B vaccine virus strain isolate 
was recovered from a placebo recipient and was confirmed to 
be vaccine-type virus. The influenza B virus isolate retained 
the cold-adapted, temperature-sensitive, attenuated phenotype. 
The placebo recipient from whom the influenza B vaccine virus 
strain was isolated had symptoms of a mild upper respiratory 
illness. The estimated probability of transmission of vaccine 
virus within a contact group with a single LAIV recipient in 
this population was 0.58% (95% CI = 0–1.7) (399).
In clinical trials, viruses isolated from vaccine recipients have 
retained attenuated phenotypes. In one study, nasal and throat 
swab specimens were collected from 17 study participants for 
2 weeks after vaccine receipt. Virus isolates were analyzed by 
multiple genetic techniques. All isolates retained the LAIV3 
genotype after replication in the human host, and all retained 
the cold-adapted and temperature-sensitive phenotypes (400).
Children
In a randomized trial published in 2007, LAIV3 and IIV3 
were compared among children aged 6–59 months (262). 
Children with medically diagnosed or treated wheezing in 
the 42 days before enrollment or with a history of severe 
asthma were excluded from participation. Among children 
aged 24–59 months who received LAIV3, the proportion of 
children who experienced medically significant wheezing was 
not greater than among those who received IIV3. Wheezing 
was observed more frequently following the first dose among 
previously unvaccinated younger LAIV3 recipients, primarily 
those aged <12 months; LAIV3 is not licensed for this age 
group. In a previous randomized placebo-controlled safety 
trial among children without a history of asthma, an increased 
risk for asthma events (RR: 4.1; 95% CI = 1.3–17.9) was 
documented among the 728 children aged 18–35 months 
who received LAIV3. Of the 16 children with asthma-related 
events in this study, seven had a history of asthma on the 
basis of subsequent medical record review. None required 
hospitalization, and increased risk for asthma events was not 
observed in other age groups (401).
In a subset of healthy children aged 60–71 months from 
one clinical trial, certain signs and symptoms were reported 
more often after the first dose among LAIV3 recipients (n = 
214) than among placebo recipients (n = 95), including runny 
nose (48% and 44%, respectively), headache (18% and 12%, 
respectively), vomiting (5% and 3%, respectively), and myalgia 
(6% and 4%, respectively) (402). However, these differences 
were not statistically significant. In other trials, signs and 
symptoms reported after LAIV3 administration have included 
runny nose or nasal congestion (18%–82%), headache (3%–
46%), fever (0–32%), vomiting (3%–17%), abdominal pain 
(2%), and myalgia (0–21%) (242,243,252,401,403–406). 
These symptoms were associated more often with the first 
dose and were self-limited. In a placebo-controlled trial in 
9,689 children aged 1–17 years assessed prespecified medically 
attended outcomes during the 42 days after vaccination, LAIV3 
was associated with increased risk for asthma, upper respiratory 
infection, musculoskeletal pain, otitis media with effusion, and 
adenitis/adenopathy. In this study, the proportion of serious 
adverse events was 0.2% in LAIV3 and placebo recipients; 
none of the serious adverse events was judged to be related to 
the vaccine by the study investigators (401).
An open-label field trial was conducted among approximately 
11,000 children aged 18 months–18 years in which 18,780 doses 
of LAIV3 were administered between 1998–2002. For children 
aged 18 months–4 years, no increase was reported in asthma visits 
0–15 days after vaccination compared with the prevaccination 
period. A significant increase in asthma events was reported 
15–42 days after vaccination, but only in vaccine year 1 (407). 
This trial later assessed LAIV3 safety among 2,196 children aged 
18 months–18 years with a history of intermittent wheezing who 
were otherwise healthy. Among these children, no increased risk 
was reported for medically attended acute respiratory illnesses, 
including acute asthma exacerbation, during the 0–14 or 
0–42 days after receipt of LAIV3 compared with the pre- and 
postvaccination reference periods (408).

A review of 460 reports (including persons aged 2 through 
70 years) to VAERS following distribution of approximately 
2.5 million doses of LAIV3 during the 2003–04 and 2004–05 
influenza seasons did not indicate any new safety concerns 
(409). Few (9%) of the LAIV3 VAERS reports concerned 
serious adverse events; respiratory events were the most 
common conditions reported. During 2005–2012, VAERS 
received 2,619 reports in children aged 2–18 years after 
receipt of LAIV3 (410). Consistent with the earlier VAERS 
study, few (7.5%) of these reports were serious and no new 
adverse event patterns were identified. During 2013–2014, 
after approximately 12.7 million doses of LAIV4 were 
distributed, VAERS received 770 reports (599 in children 
aged 2–17 years); the safety profile of LAIV4 was consistent 
with prelicensure clinical trials and data from postlicensure 
assessment of LAIV3 (411).
Adults
In one clinical trial among a subset of healthy adults aged 
18–49 years, signs and symptoms reported significantly more 
often (p<0.05; Fisher exact test) among LAIV3 recipients 
(n = 2,548) than placebo recipients (n = 1,290) within 7 days 
after each dose included cough (14% versus 10%), runny 
nose (44% versus 27%), sore throat (27% versus 16%), chills 
(89% versus 6%), and tiredness/weakness (25% versus 21%) 
(402). A review of 460 reports to VAERS after distribution 
of approximately 2.5 million doses of LAIV3 during the 
2003–04 and 2004–05 influenza seasons did not indicate any 
new safety concerns (409). Few (9%) of the VAERS reports 
described serious adverse events; respiratory events were the 
most common conditions reported.
Persons at Higher Risk for Influenza-Related 
Complications
Limited data assessing the safety of LAIV use for certain 
groups at higher risk for influenza-related complications 
are available. LAIV3 was well-tolerated among adults aged 
≥65 years with chronic medical conditions (412). In a study 
of 57 HIV-infected persons aged 18–58 years with CD4+ 
counts >200 cells/µL who received LAIV3, no serious adverse 
events attributable to vaccines were reported during a 1-month 
follow-up period (397). Similarly, another study demonstrated 
no significant difference in the frequency of adverse events or 
viral shedding among 24 HIV-infected children aged 1–8 years 
on effective antiretroviral therapy who were administered 
LAIV3 compared with 25 HIV-uninfected children receiving 
LAIV3 (398). In a study comparing immunogenicity and 
shedding of LAIV4 among 46 HIV-infected (CD4+ counts 
>200 cells/µL) and 56 uninfected persons aged 2 through 
25 years, adverse events were similar between the two groups. 
Shedding of vaccine virus was somewhat more prevalent among 
the HIV-infected participants, 67% of whom shed any vaccine 
virus up to 14–21 days postvaccination, compared with 50% 
of uninfected participants (p = 0.14) (413).
Among 27 reports to VAERS involving inadvertent 
administration of LAIV3 to pregnant women during 1990–
2009, no unusual patterns of maternal or fetal outcomes were 
observed (318); among 138 reports noted in a health insurance 
claims database, all outcomes occurred at similar rates to 
those observed in unvaccinated women (414). These findings 
suggest that persons at risk for influenza complications who 
have inadvertent exposure to LAIV are not expected to have 
significant adverse events or prolonged viral shedding and 
that persons who have contact with persons at higher risk for 
influenza-related complications may receive LAIV.
Data on the relative safety of LAIV and IIV are limited 
for children and adults with chronic medical conditions 
conferring a higher risk for influenza complications. Safety 
data were collected from 1,940 children aged 2–5 years with 
asthma or prior wheezing from two randomized, multinational 
trials of LAIV3 and IIV3 (415). The results showed that 
wheezing, lower respiratory illness, and hospitalization were 
not significantly increased among children receiving LAIV3 
relative to IIV3; however, increased prevalence of rhinorrhea 
(8.1% LAIV versus 3.1% IIV3; p=0.002) and irritability 
(2.0% versus 0.3%; p = 0.04) were observed among LAIV3 
recipients. A study of LAIV and IIV3 among children aged 
6–17 years with asthma noted no significant difference in 
wheezing events after receipt of LAIV3 (264). Available data 
are insufficient to determine the level of severity of asthma for 
which administration of LAIV would be inadvisable.
Safety of RIV
RIV, currently available as a trivalent vaccine (RIV3) has 
been available in the United States since the 2013–14 season. 
In prelicensure studies, the most frequently reported injection-
site reaction (reported in ≥10% of recipients) was pain (37% 
among those aged 18 through 49 years; 32% among those aged 
50 through 64 years, and 19% among those aged ≥65 years); 
the most common solicited systemic reactions were headache 
(15%, 17%, and 10%, respectively), fatigue (15%, 13%, and 
13%, respectively), and myalgia (11% among persons aged 
18 through 49 years and 11% among those aged 50 through 
64 years) (273). Local pain and tenderness were reported 
significantly more frequently with RIV3 than placebo; 
however, most reports of pain following RIV3 were rated as 
mild. As a relatively new vaccine, fewer postmarketing safety 
data have accumulated for RIV3.

Immediate Hypersensitivity Reactions 
After Receipt of Influenza Vaccines
Vaccine components can occasionally cause allergic 
reactions, also called immediate hypersensitivity reactions. 
Immediate hypersensitivity reactions are mediated by 
preformed immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies against a 
vaccine component and usually occur within minutes to hours 
of exposure (416). Symptoms of immediate hypersensitivity 
range from urticaria (hives) to angioedema and anaphylaxis. 
Anaphylaxis is a severe life-threatening reaction that involves 
multiple organ systems and can progress rapidly. Symptoms 
and signs of anaphylaxis can include but are not limited to 
generalized urticaria; wheezing; swelling of the mouth, tongue, 
and throat; difficulty breathing; vomiting; hypotension; 
decreased level of consciousness; and shock. Minor symptoms 
such as red eyes or hoarse voice also might be present (416,417).
Allergic reactions might be caused by the vaccine antigen, 
residual animal protein, antimicrobial agents, preservatives, 
stabilizers, or other vaccine components (8,418). Manufacturers 
use a variety of compounds to inactivate influenza viruses and 
add may antibiotics to prevent bacterial growth. Package 
inserts for specific vaccines of interest should be consulted 
for additional information. ACIP has recommended that all 
vaccine providers should be familiar with the office emergency 
plan and be certified in cardiopulmonary resuscitation 
(8). The Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment (CISA) 
Project (http://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/ensuringsafety/
monitoring/cisa), a collaboration between CDC and medical 
research centers with expertise in vaccinology and vaccine 
safety, has developed an algorithm to guide evaluation and 
revaccination decisions for persons with suspected immediate 
hypersensitivity after vaccination (416).
Anaphylaxis after receipt of influenza vaccines is rare. A 
VSD study conducted during 2009–2011 observed that the 
incidence of anaphylaxis in the 0–2 days after any vaccine was 
1.31 (95% CI = 0.90–1.84) cases per million vaccine doses 
in all ages. The incidence of anaphylaxis in the 0–2 days after 
IIV3 (without other vaccines) was 1.35 (95% CI = 0.65–2.47) 
per million IIV3 doses administered in all ages (419). 
Anaphylaxis occurring after receipt of IIV and LAIV rarely 
has been reported to VAERS (305,409,420,421). A VSD 
study of children aged <18 years in four health maintenance 
organizations during 1991–1997 estimated the overall risk for 
postvaccination anaphylaxis after any type of childhood vaccine 
to be approximately 1.5 cases per 1 million doses administered. 
In this study, no cases were identified in IIV3 recipients (422).
Recommendations for the Use of 
Influenza Vaccines, 2016–17 Season
Groups Recommended for Vaccination
Routine annual influenza vaccination is recommended for all 
persons aged ≥6 months who do not have contraindications. 
Recommendations regarding timing of vaccination, 
considerations for specific populations, the use of specific 
vaccines, and contraindications and precautions, are 
summarized in the sections that follow.
Timing of Vaccination
Optimally, vaccination should occur before onset of influenza 
activity in the community. Health care providers should offer 
vaccination by the end of October, if possible. Children aged 
6 months through 8 years who require 2 doses (see Children 
Aged 6 Months Through 8 Years) should receive their first 
dose as soon as possible after vaccine becomes available, and 
the second dose ≥4 weeks later. The majority of adults have a 
protective antibody response within 2 weeks after vaccination 
(423,424). Vaccination should continue to be offered as long 
as influenza viruses are circulating and unexpired vaccine 
is available. To avoid missed opportunities for vaccination, 
providers should offer vaccination during routine health care 
visits and hospitalizations when vaccine is available.
Vaccination efforts should be structured to ensure the 
vaccination of as many persons as possible before influenza 
activity in the community begins. In any given season, the 
optimal time to vaccinate cannot be predicted precisely because 
influenza seasons vary in timing and duration. Moreover, 
more than one outbreak might occur in a given community 
in a single year. In the United States, localized outbreaks that 
indicate the start of seasonal influenza activity can occur as 
early as October. However, in 74% of influenza seasons since 
1982, peak influenza activity (which often is close to the 
midpoint of influenza activity for the season) has not occurred 
until January or later, and in 59% of seasons, the peak was in 
February or later (425).
In recent seasons, initial shipments of influenza vaccine 
have arrived to some vaccine providers as early as July. Very 
early availability of vaccine as compared with typical onset 
and peak of influenza activity raises questions related to the 
ideal time to begin vaccination. In particular, some recent 
studies raise the possibility that very early vaccination of adults, 
particularly the elderly, might contribute to reduced protection 
later in the season. Protective antibody levels decline over time 
postvaccination (426–428). However, one study of HA and 
 Recommendations and Reports
MMWR / August 26, 2016 / Vol. 65 / No. 5 
27
US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
neuraminidase antibody levels following vaccination of adults 
noted a slow decline, with a 2-fold decrease in titer taking 
>600 days (429). A review of studies reporting postvaccination 
seroprotection rates among adults aged ≥60 years noted that 
seroprotection levels meeting Committee of Proprietary 
Medicinal Products standards were maintained for ≥4 months 
for the H3N2 component in all 8 studies and for the H1N1 
and B components in 5 of 7 studies (430).
Several observational studies of influenza vaccine effectiveness 
have reported decreased vaccine protection within a single 
season, particularly against influenza A(H3N2) (118–121). 
Some have noted a more pronounced decline in protection 
among older adults. However, this effect has not been observed 
consistently across age groups and seasons, and the observed 
decline in protection could be attributable to other factors, such 
as increased circulation of antigenically drifted variants over the 
course of the influenza season. A test negative case-control study 
of children and adults conducted in Navarre, Spain during the 
2011–12 season noted a decline in vaccine effectiveness, from 61% 
(95% CI = 5–84) in the first 100 days after vaccination to 42% 
(95% CI = -39–75) between days 100–119 and then to -35% 
(95% CI = -211–41) after ≥120 days. Persons vaccinated ≥120 
days before diagnosis were at an increased risk for contracting 
influenza, when compared with those vaccinated <100 days 
(OR: 3.45; 95% CI = 1.10–10.85; p = 0.034) (119). This 
decline primarily affected persons aged ≥65 years, among whom 
the OR for influenza was 20.81 (95% CI = 2.14–202.71; p = 
0.009) for persons vaccinated >120 days before diagnosis versus 
those vaccinated <100 days before diagnosis. A similar study 
conducted in the United Kingdom, also during the 2011–12 
season, estimated an overall vaccine effectiveness against A(H3N2) 
of 53% (95% CI = 0–78) among those vaccinated <3 months 
prior, and 12% (95% CI = -31–41) for those vaccinated ≥3 
months prior. The proportion of older participants was too small 
to detect a substantial difference in vaccine effectiveness in this 
age group (121). An additional case-control analysis from the 
2007–08 season revealed a modest but significant increase in the 
OR for A(H3N2) influenza every 14 days after vaccination among 
young children (OR for influenza increasing 1.2 for each 14-day 
interval for children aged 2 years) and older adults (1.3 for each 
14-day interval for adults aged 75 years); the same pattern was 
not observed among older children and younger adults (118). 
The inconsistent evidence for intraseason waning of influenza 
vaccine protection makes drawing conclusions difficult, and 
further evaluation of this effect in larger studies and different 
seasons is needed.
Although delaying vaccination until later in the season might 
result in greater immunity later in the season, such deferral 
might also result in missed opportunities to vaccinate, as well as 
difficulties in vaccinating a population within a more constrained 
time period. Community vaccination programs should balance 
maximizing likelihood of persistence of vaccine-induced 
protection through the season with avoiding missed opportunities 
to vaccinate or vaccinating after onset of influenza circulation 
occurs. Revaccination later in the season of persons who have 
already been fully vaccinated is not recommended. ACIP will 
continue to evaluate additional data as they become available.
Vaccination efforts should continue throughout the season, 
because the duration of the influenza season varies and 
influenza activity might not occur in certain communities 
until February or March. Providers should offer influenza 
vaccine routinely, and organized vaccination campaigns should 
continue throughout the influenza season, including after 
influenza activity has begun in the community. Although 
vaccination by the end of October is recommended, vaccine 
administered in December or later, even if influenza activity 
has already begun, is likely to be beneficial in the majority of 
influenza seasons.
Guidance for Use in Specific 
Populations
Persons at Risk for Medical Complications 
Attributable to Severe Influenza
Vaccination to prevent influenza is particularly important for 
persons who are at increased risk for severe complications from 
influenza, or at higher risk for influenza-related outpatient, ED, 
or hospital visits. When vaccine supply is limited, vaccination 
efforts should focus on delivering vaccination to the following 
persons who do not have contraindications (no hierarchy is 
implied by order of listing):
• all children aged 6 through 59 months;
• all persons aged ≥50 years;
• adults and children who have chronic pulmonary 
(including asthma) or cardiovascular (except isolated 
hypertension), renal, hepatic, neurologic, hematologic, or 
metabolic disorders (including diabetes mellitus);
• persons who have immunosuppression (including 
immunosuppression caused by medications or by 
HIV infection);
• women who are or will be pregnant during the 
influenza season;
• children and adolescents (aged 6 months–18 years) who are 
receiving long-term aspirin therapy and who might be at risk 
for experiencing Reye syndrome after influenza virus infection;
• residents of nursing homes and other long-term care facilities;
• American Indians/Alaska Natives; and
• persons who are extremely obese (BMI ≥40).

Persons Who Live With or Care for Persons 
at High Risk for Influenza-Related 
Complications
All persons aged ≥6 months without contraindications 
should be vaccinated annually; however, continued emphasis 
should be placed on vaccination of persons who live with 
or care for persons at higher risk for influenza-related 
complications. When vaccine supply is limited, vaccination 
efforts should focus on delivering vaccination to persons at 
higher risk for influenza-related complications listed above, 
as well as these persons:
• health care personnel, including physicians, nurses, and 
other workers in inpatient and outpatient-care settings, 
medical emergency-response workers (e.g., paramedics and 
emergency medical technicians), employees of nursing home 
and long-term care facilities who have contact with patients 
or residents, and students in these professions who will have 
contact with patients. ACIP guidance for immunization of 
health care personnel has been published previously.
• household contacts (including children) and caregivers of 
children aged ≤59 months (i.e., aged <5 years) and adults 
aged ≥50 years, particularly contacts of children aged 
<6 months; and
• household contacts (including children) and caregivers of 
persons with medical conditions that put them at high 
risk for severe complications from influenza.
ACIP recommends that LAIV4 not be used during the 
2016–17 season for any population. Should LAIV be available, 
providers who elect to use it should consider previous guidance 
for use of LAIV4 for persons who care for or have contact 
with immunocompromised persons. Health care personnel 
and persons who are contacts of persons in these groups and 
who are contacts of severely immunocompromised persons 
(those living in a protected environment) may receive any IIV 
or RIV influenza vaccine that is otherwise indicated. ACIP 
and HICPAC have previously recommended that health care 
personnel who receive LAIV4 should avoid providing care 
for severely immunosuppressed patients requiring a protected 
environment for 7 days after vaccination, and that hospital 
visitors who have received LAIV4 should avoid contact with 
severely immunosuppressed persons (i.e., persons requiring a 
protected environment) for 7 days after vaccination. However, 
such visitors should not be restricted from visiting less severely 
immunosuppressed patients (431).
Children Aged 6 Months Through 8 Years
Evidence from several studies indicates that children aged 
6 months through 8 years require 2 doses of influenza vaccine 
(administered a minimum of 4 weeks apart) during their 
first season of vaccination for optimal protection (138–141). 
Several studies using serologic endpoints have indicated that 
intervals between two initial doses from 4 weeks to 1 year 
produce similar immune responses when the antigens in the 
2 doses are the same (432–434). Because of the change in 
vaccine composition for the 2016–17 season, children aged 
6 months through 8 years will need to have received ≥2 doses 
of influenza vaccine previously to require only 1 dose for the 
2016–17 season.
For 2016–17, ACIP recommends that children aged 
6 months through 8 years who have previously received 
≥2 total doses of trivalent or quadrivalent influenza vaccine 
before July 1, 2016 require only 1 dose for 2016–17. The 
two previous doses need not have been given during the same 
season or consecutive seasons. Children in this age group who 
have not previously received a total of ≥2 doses of trivalent 
or quadrivalent influenza vaccine before July 1, 2016 require 
2 doses for the 2016–17 season. The interval between the 
2 doses should be at least 4 weeks (Figure).

Influenza Vaccination of Pregnant Women
Because pregnant and postpartum women are at higher 
risk for severe illness and complications from influenza than 
women who are not pregnant, the ACIP recommends that all 
women who are pregnant or who might be pregnant in the 
upcoming influenza season receive IIV. Influenza vaccination 
can be administered at any time during pregnancy, before 
and during the influenza season. The ACIP recommends that 
LAIV4 not be used in any population for the 2016–17 season; 
providers considering its use should note that LAIV4 should 
not be used during pregnancy.
Vaccination of Older Adults
For persons aged ≥65 years, any age-appropriate IIV 
formulation (standard-dose or high-dose, trivalent or 
quadrivalent, unadjuvanted or adjuvanted) or RIV3 is an 
acceptable option. No preference is expressed for any one of 
these vaccines over another for this age group. High-dose IIV3 
(available as Fluzone High-Dose) is licensed for persons aged 
≥65 years. Immunogenicity data from three prelicensure studies 
among persons aged ≥65 years indicated that, compared with 
standard dose Fluzone, Fluzone High-Dose elicited higher 
HAI titers against all three influenza virus strains included in 
seasonal influenza vaccines recommended during the study 
period. Some solicited injection-site and systemic adverse 
events were more frequent after vaccination with Fluzone 
High-Dose compared with standard Fluzone, but typically 
were mild and transient (180–183). In a randomized controlled 
trial comparing high-dose versus standard-dose IIV3, 
conducted among over 30,000 community-dwelling persons 
aged ≥65 years, high-dose IIV3 was 24.2% more effective in 
preventing LCI associated with protocol-defined ILI (184).
In addition to standard-dose IIV3 and IIV4 and high-dose 
IIV3, aIIV3 (licensed for persons aged ≥65 years) is expected 
to be available for the 2016–17 season. No data directly 
comparing high-dose IIV3 and aIIV3 are available. ACIP will 
continue to review data related to the relative effectiveness of 
these vaccines in older adults.
Vaccination of Immunocompromised Persons
Immunocompromised states are caused by a heterogeneous 
range of conditions. In many instances, limited data are 
available regarding the use of influenza vaccines in the setting of 
specific immunocompromised states. The ACIP recommends 
that LAIV4 not be used in any population for the 2016–17 
season; providers considering its use should note that live 
virus vaccines should not be used for persons with most 
forms of altered immunocompetence (8), given the uncertain 
but biologically plausible risk for disease attributable to the 
vaccine virus. In addition to potential safety issues, immune 
response to live or inactivated vaccines might be blunted in 
some clinical situations, such as for persons with congenital 
immune deficiencies, persons receiving cancer chemotherapy, 
and persons receiving immunosuppressive medications. For 
this reason, timing of vaccination might be a consideration 
(e.g., vaccinating during some period either before or after an 
immunocompromising intervention).
The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) has 
published detailed guidance for the selection and timing of 
vaccines for persons with specific immunocompromising 
conditions, including congenital immune disorders, stem cell 
and solid organ transplant, anatomic and functional asplenia, 
and therapeutic drug-induced immunosuppression, as well as 
for persons with cochlear implants or other conditions leading 
to persistent cerebrospinal fluid-oropharyngeal communication 
(435). ACIP will continue to review accumulating data on use 
of influenza vaccines in these contexts.
Influenza Vaccination of Persons with a 
History of Egg Allergy
Severe allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, can occur 
in response to various components of all types of vaccines. 
Such reactions are fortunately rare. A VSD study of over 
25.1 million doses of vaccine of various types (i.e., not 
exclusively influenza vaccines) administered to children and 
adults revealed a total of 33 cases of reactions consistent with 
anaphylaxis, giving a rate of 1.31 (95% CI = 0.90–1.84) per 1 
million vaccine doses. In eight cases, symptoms began within 
30 minutes of vaccination; however, in 21 cases, symptom 
onset was >30 minutes postvaccination, including one case in 
which symptoms began the following day. Among more than 
7.4 million doses of IIV3 given without other vaccines, there 
were 10 cases of anaphylaxis (1.35; 95% CI = 0.65–2.47 per 
1 million doses) (419).
As is the case for other vaccines, influenza vaccines contain 
various different components that might cause allergic and 
anaphylactic reactions. Not all such reactions are related to 
egg proteins; however, the possibility of reactions to influenza 
vaccines in egg-allergic persons might be of concern to 
these persons and vaccine providers. With the exceptions of 
RIV3 and ccIIV4, currently available influenza vaccines are 
prepared by propagation of virus in embryonated eggs. Not 
all manufacturers disclose ovalbumin content in their package 
inserts. Among influenza vaccines for which ovalbumin content 
was disclosed during the 2011–12 through 2014–15 seasons, 
reported maximum amounts were ≤1 µg/0.5 mL dose for IIVs 
and <0.24 µg/0.2 mL dose for LAIV4. Of the two vaccines

produced using nonegg based technologies, RIV3 (Flublok; 
Protein Sciences, Meriden, Connecticut) and ccIIV4 (Flucelvax 
Quadrivalent; Seqirus, Holly Springs, North Carolina), only 
Flublok is considered egg-free. Ovalbumin is not directly 
measured for Flucelvax, but it is estimated by calculation from 
the initial content in the reference virus strains to contain 
a maximum of 5x10-8 µg/0.5 mL dose of total egg protein 
(Seqirus, unpublished data, 2016).
Reviews of studies of experience with use of IIV, and more 
recently LAIV, indicate that severe allergic reactions to the 
currently available egg-based influenza vaccines in persons with egg 
allergy are unlikely. In a 2012 review of published data, including 
4,172 egg-allergic patients (513 reporting a history of severe 
allergic reaction) there were no noted occurrences of anaphylaxis 
following administration of IIV3, though some milder reactions 
did occur (436). Subsequently, several evaluations of LAIV use 
in persons with egg allergy have been published. In a prospective 
cohort study of children aged 2 through 16 years (68 with egg 
allergy and 55 without), all of whom received LAIV, none of the 
egg-allergic subjects developed signs or symptoms of an allergic 
reaction during the one hour of postvaccination observation, and 
none reported adverse reactions that were suggestive of allergic 
reaction or that required medical attention after 24 hours (437). 
In a larger study of 282 egg-allergic children aged 2 through 
17 years (115 of whom had experienced anaphylactic reactions to 
egg previously), no systemic allergic reactions were observed after 
LAIV administration (438). Eight children experienced milder, 
self-limited symptoms that might have been caused by an IgE-
mediated reaction. In another study of 779 egg-allergic children 
aged 2 through 18 years (270 of whom had previous anaphylactic 
reactions to egg), no systemic allergic reactions occurred. Nine 
children (1.2%) experienced milder symptoms, possibly allergic 
in nature within 30 minutes of vaccination (four rhinitis, four 
localized/contact urticaria, and one oropharyngeal itching) (439). 
A study that compared adverse reactions in eight egg-allergic 
and five nonegg-allergic children when given increasing doses 
of egg protein (440) showed only mild symptoms of rhinitis 
after exposure to 10–100 µg. This is substantially more than the 
concentration of ovalbumin reported on the LAIV package insert 
(<0.24 µg per 0.2 mL dose). All eight egg-allergic children tolerated 
LAIV doses without any allergic symptoms. These data indicate 
that LAIV4 may be administered safely to persons with a history of 
egg allergy. However, ACIP recommends that LAIV4 not be used 
in any population during the 2016–17 season because of concerns 
regarding effectiveness against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09.
Occasional cases of anaphylaxis in egg-allergic persons have 
been reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System 
(VAERS) after administration of influenza vaccines (420,421). 
ACIP will continue to review available data regarding anaphylaxis 
cases following influenza vaccines.
Persons who are able to eat lightly cooked egg (e.g., scrambled 
egg) without reaction are unlikely to be allergic. Egg-allergic 
persons might tolerate egg in baked products (e.g., bread or 
cake). Tolerance to egg-containing foods does not exclude 
the possibility of egg allergy. Egg allergy can be confirmed 
by a consistent medical history of adverse reactions to eggs 
and egg-containing foods, plus skin and/or blood testing for 
immunoglobulin E directed against egg proteins (441).
Although RIV does not contain egg protein, it has been 
associated with anaphylactic and other, less severe reactions 
reported in VAERS. A review of VAERS reports from January 
2013 through June 2014 noted 12 reports that included 
signs and symptoms consistent with acute hypersensitivity 
reactions following administration of RIV3 (442). All were 
considered to be consistent with possible anaphylaxis; 3 cases 
appeared to meet Brighton Collaboration criteria (426) 
for level 2 anaphylaxis. Although it is not possible to infer 
causality from these data, they illustrate that allergic reactions 
following influenza vaccination are not necessarily related 
to egg proteins. A randomized safety study of RIV3 versus a 
licensed comparator IIV3 among adults aged ≥50 years found 
RIV to be noninferior to IIV3 with regard to the occurrence 
of expert-adjudicated events of likely hypersensitivity (443).
For the 2016–17 influenza season, ACIP recommends 
the following:
1. Persons with a history of egg allergy who have experienced 
only hives after exposure to egg should receive influenza 
vaccine. Any licensed and recommended influenza 
vaccine (i.e., any age-appropriate IIV or RIV3) that is 
otherwise appropriate for the recipient’s age and health 
status may be used.
2. Persons who report having had reactions to egg involving 
symptoms other than hives, such as angioedema, 
respiratory distress, lightheadedness, or recurrent emesis; 
or who required epinephrine or another emergency 
medical intervention, may similarly receive any licensed 
and recommended influenza vaccine (i.e., any age-
appropriate IIV or RIV3) that is otherwise appropriate 
for the recipient’s age and health status. The selected 
vaccine should be administered in an inpatient or 
outpatient medical setting (including but not necessarily 
limited to hospitals, clinics, health departments, and 
physician offices). Vaccine administration should be 
supervised by a health care provider who is able to 
recognize and manage severe allergic conditions.
3. A previous severe allergic reaction to influenza vaccine, 
regardless of the component suspected of being 
responsible for the reaction, is a contraindication to 
future receipt of the vaccine.

Use of Influenza Antiviral Medications
Administration of IIV to persons receiving influenza antiviral 
drugs for treatment or chemoprophylaxis is acceptable. 
ACIP recommends that LAIV4 should not be used during 
the 2016–17 season. However, if used, LAIV4 should not 
be administered until 48 hours after cessation of influenza 
antiviral therapy, because antiviral drugs reduce replication of 
influenza viruses (444). If influenza antiviral medications are 
administered within 2 weeks after receipt of LAIV4, the LAIV4 
dose should be repeated ≥48 hours after the last dose of antiviral 
medication. Alternatively, persons receiving antiviral drugs 
within the period 2 days before to 14 days after vaccination 
with LAIV4 may be revaccinated with another appropriate 
vaccine formulation (e.g., IIV or RIV).
Vaccination Issues for Travelers
In temperate climate regions of the Northern and Southern 
hemispheres, influenza activity is seasonal, occurring 
approximately from October through May in the Northern 
Hemisphere and April through September in the Southern 
Hemisphere. In the tropics, influenza occurs throughout the year. 
Travelers can be exposed to influenza when travelling to an area 
where influenza is circulating, or when traveling as part of large 
tourist groups (e.g., cruise ships) that include persons from areas 
of the world in which influenza viruses are circulating (445,446). 
In a survey among Swiss travelers to tropical and subtropical 
countries, influenza was the most frequently acquired vaccine-
preventable disease (447). Among 109 travelers returning to 
Australia from travel in Asia who reported acute respiratory 
infection symptoms, 4 had evidence of influenza A infection 
(evidenced by fourfold rise in antibody titer) (448).
Travelers who wish to reduce the risk for influenza infection 
should consider influenza vaccination, preferably at least 
2 weeks before departure. In particular, persons at high risk 
for complications of influenza and who were not vaccinated 
with influenza vaccine during the preceding fall or winter 
should consider receiving influenza vaccine before travel if 
they plan to travel:
• to the tropics,
• with organized tourist groups or on cruise ships at any 
time of year, or
• to the Southern Hemisphere during April–September.
No information is available indicating a benefit to 
revaccinating persons before summer travel who already were 
vaccinated during the preceding fall. Revaccination is not 
recommended. Persons at high risk who receive the previous 
season’s vaccine before travel should receive the current vaccine 
the following fall or winter. Persons at higher risk for influenza 
complications should consult with their health care practitioner 
to discuss the risk for influenza or other travel-related diseases 
before embarking on travel during the summer.
Influenza vaccine formulated for the Southern Hemisphere 
might differ in viral composition from the Northern 
Hemisphere vaccine. However, Southern Hemisphere 
formulation seasonal influenza vaccines generally are not 
licensed or commercially available in the United States. More 
information on influenza vaccines and travel is available at 
http://www.cdc.gov/flu/travelers/travelersfacts.htm.
Concurrent Administration of Influenza 
Vaccine with Other Vaccines
Limited data are available on the concurrent administration 
of influenza vaccines with other live vaccines. Use of LAIV3 
concurrently with measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) and 
varicella vaccine among children aged 12 through 15 months 
has been studied, and no interference with the immunogenicity 
to antigens in any of the vaccines was observed (449) Among 
adults aged ≥50 years, the safety and immunogenicity of 
zoster vaccine and IIV3 were similar whether administered 
simultaneously or sequentially spaced 4 weeks apart (450).
In the absence of specific data indicating interference, 
following ACIP’s general recommendations for vaccination 
is prudent (8). Inactivated vaccines do not interfere with 
the immune response to other inactivated vaccines or to live 
vaccines. LAIV4 is not recommended for use in 2016–17. 
Providers considering its use should note that although 
inactivated or live vaccines can be administered simultaneously 
with LAIV4, after administration of a live vaccine (such as 
LAIV4), at least 4 weeks should pass before another live vaccine 
is administered.
Influenza Vaccine Composition and 
Available Products
Influenza Vaccine Composition for the 
2016–17 Season
All influenza vaccines licensed in the United States will 
contain HA derived from influenza viruses antigenically 
identical to those recommended by FDA (451). Both trivalent 
and quadrivalent influenza vaccines will be available in the 
United States (Table 1). 
The 2016–17 U.S. influenza vaccines will contain HA 
derived from the following:
• an A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)–like virus,
• an A/Hong Kong/ 4801/2014 (H3N2)–like virus, and
• a B/Brisbane/60/2008–like virus (Victoria lineage).

MMWR / August 26, 2016 / Vol. 65 / No. 5
US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
The 2016–17 U.S. quadrivalent vaccines will contain the 
same three antigens, and an additional influenza B virus HA, 
derived from a B/Phuket/3073/2013–like virus (Yamagata 
lineage). The composition for 2016–17 represents a change 
in the influenza A(H3N2) virus and a switch in lineage for 
the influenza B viruses.
Vaccine Products for the 2016–17 Season
A variety of influenza vaccine products are licensed 
(Table 1) and available from several different manufacturers. 
For many vaccine recipients, more than one type or brand of 
vaccine might be appropriate within indications and ACIP 
recommendations. A licensed, age-appropriate influenza 
vaccine product should be used. Considerations for selection of 
a given vaccine when several appropriate options are available 
are discussed below. However, not all products are likely to 
be uniformly available in any practice setting or locality. For 
newer vaccines, fewer postmarketing safety and effectiveness 
data are available, prohibiting a full risk-benefit analysis of 
newer versus previously available products. Therefore, within 
these guidelines and approved indications, where more than 
one type of vaccine is appropriate and available, no preferential 
recommendation is made for use of any influenza vaccine 
product over another. Vaccination should not be delayed in 
order to obtain a specific product when an appropriate one 
is already available. Moreover, these recommendations apply 
to all licensed influenza vaccines used within Food and Drug 
Administration–licensed indications, including changes in 
FDA-approved labeling that might occur after publication of 
this document. Differences between ACIP recommendations 
and labeled indications are noted (Table 1).
Recently Licensed Influenza Vaccine 
Products
Fluad (MF59-Adjuvanted Standard-dose IIV3 [aIIV3])
In November 2015, FDA licensed Fluad (Seqirus, Holly Springs, 
North Carolina), a trivalent, MF59-adjuvanted inactivated 
influenza vaccine, for persons aged ≥65 years. Fluad is the first 
adjuvanted influenza vaccine marketed in the United States. It is 
a standard-dose vaccine, containing 15 µg of HA per vaccine virus 
per dose. Contraindications and precautions are similar to those 
for other inactivated influenza vaccines (see Contraindications 
and Precautions for the Use of IIV) (Table 2) (314).
In clinical studies comparing Fluad with the nonadjuvanted 
IIV3 among persons aged 65 years and over, the solicited adverse 
reactions reported by ≥10% of participants who received 
Fluad included injection site pain, (25.0% versus 12.2%), 
tenderness (21.1% versus 11.2%), myalgia (14.7% versus 
9.7%), headache (13.2% versus 11.2%) and fatigue (13.3% 
versus 10.4%). In a comparison of immunogenicity of the 
two vaccines, Fluad met criteria for noninferiority for all 
three vaccine viruses based on predefined thresholds for 
seroconversion rate differences and GMT ratios (314). In a 
Canadian observational study of 282 persons aged ≥65 years 
conducted during the 2011–12 season that compared Fluad 
with unadjuvanted IIV3, the relative effectiveness of Fluad 
against LCI was 63% (95% CI = 4–86) (452). To date, there 
have been no randomized studies comparing Fluad with 
Fluzone High-Dose, which is also indicated for this age group 
and has demonstrated improved efficacy over standard-dose 
IIV3 in a randomized controlled trial (184).
Flucelvax Quadrivalent (Cell Culture-Based IIV4 
[ccIIV4])
In May 2016, FDA licensed Flucelvax Quadrivalent (Seqirus, 
Holly Springs, North Carolina), a cell culture-based IIV4, for 
persons aged ≥4 years. Similarly to the previously licensed 
trivalent formulation of Flucelvax, Flucelvax Quadrivalent 
is prepared from virus propagated in Madin-Darby canine 
kidney cells rather than in eggs. Prelicensure data included 
two separate immunogenicity and safety studies conducted 
among persons aged ≥18 years and 4 through 17 years, 
respectively. Each study compared ccIIV4 with two licensed 
comparator ccIIV3s (the trivalent formulation of Flucelvax), 
each containing one of the two influenza B viruses included in 
the IIV4. Flucelvax Quadrivalent met criteria for immunogenic 
noninferiority in both studies (453,454). Among adults aged 
18 through 64 years, solicited adverse reactions reported by 
≥10% of participants who received Flucelvax Quadrivalent 
were injection-site pain (45.4%) headache (18.7%), fatigue 
(17.8%) myalgia (15.4%), injection-site erythema (13.4%), 
and induration (11.6%); among persons aged ≥65 years these 
were injection-site pain (21.6%) and injection-site erythema 
(11.9%). Among children, solicited adverse reactions reported 
by ≥10% of participants who received Flucelvax Quadrivalent 
were as follows: among children aged 4 through 5 years, 
tenderness at the injection site (46%), injection-site erythema 
(18%), sleepiness (19%), irritability (16%), injection-site 
induration (13%) and change in eating habits (10%); among 
children aged 6 through 8 years pain at the injection site (54%), 
injection-site erythema (22%), injection-site induration (16%), 
headache (14%), fatigue (13%) and myalgia (12%); and among 
children aged 9 through 17 years pain at the injection site 
(58%), headache (22%), injection-site erythema (19%), fatigue 
(18%) myalgia (16%), and injection-site induration (15%). 
In general, prevalences of these events were similar to those 
observed with the comparator trivalent vaccines.

US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
In addition to the new licensure of Flucelvax Quadrivalent, 
the trivalent formulation of Flucelvax, which was previously 
licensed for persons aged ≥18 years, is now licensed for 
persons aged ≥4 years. Licensure was based upon evaluation 
of immunogenicity of Flucelvax versus Fluvirin (egg-based 
standard-dose IIV3; Seqirus, Holly Springs, North Carolina) 
in children 4 through 17 years of age (455). In this analysis, 
prespecified criteria for noninferiority of Flucelvax were not 
met for the A(H3N2) component for children 4 through 
8 years of age; however, other immunogenicity endpoints 
for A(H3N2) were met. It is anticipated that the trivalent 
formulation of Flucelvax will not be available for 2016–17, and 
will instead be replaced by the new quadrivalent formulation.
Storage of Influenza Vaccines
In all instances, approved manufacturer packaging 
information should be consulted for authoritative guidance 
concerning storage of all influenza vaccines. Vaccines should be 
protected from light and stored at recommended temperatures. 
In general, influenza vaccines should be refrigerated between 
2° to 8° C (36° to 46° F) and should not be frozen; vaccine 
that has frozen should be discarded. Single-dose vials should 
not be accessed for more than 1 dose. Multi-dose vials should 
be returned to recommended storage conditions between 
uses, and once accessed should not be kept beyond the 
recommended period of time. In addition, the cold chain must 
be maintained when LAIV4 is transported. For information on 
permissible temperature excursions and other departures from 
recommended storage conditions that are not discussed in the 
package insert, contact the manufacturer. Vaccine should not 
be used after the expiration date on the label.
Inactivated Influenza Vaccines (IIVs)
Available products: IIVs comprise a large group of products. 
For the 2016–17 season, both IIV4 and IIV3 products are 
expected to be available. All IIVs are manufactured through 
propagation of virus in eggs, with the exception of the cell 
culture-based vaccine Flucelvax Quadrivalent (Seqirus, 
Holly Springs, North Carolina), for which (similarly to the 
previous trivalent formulation of Flucelvax) vaccine viruses 
are propagated in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. All IIVs 
licensed in the United States contain no adjuvant, with the 
exception of the recently approved MF59-adjuvanted trivalent 
inactivated influenza vaccine, Fluad (Seqirus, Holly Springs, 
North Carolina).
As a class, IIVs include products that can be administered to 
all persons aged ≥6 months. However, approved age indications 
for the various IIV products differ (Table 1). Only age-
appropriate products should be administered. Providers should 
consult package inserts and updated CDC/ACIP guidance 
for current information. Of particular note, although Afluria 
(Seqirus, Parkville, Victoria, Australia) is FDA-approved for

 Recommendations and Reports
34 
MMWR / August 26, 2016 / Vol. 65 / No. 5
US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
children aged ≥5 years, CDC and ACIP recommend against 
use of Afluria in persons aged <9 years because of increased risk 
for febrile reactions noted in this age group with Seqirus’s 2010 
Southern Hemisphere IIV3 (288). If no other age-appropriate, 
licensed inactivated seasonal influenza vaccine is available for 
a child aged 5 through 8 years who has a medical condition 
that increases the child’s risk for influenza complications, 
Afluria can be used; however, providers should discuss with 
the parents or caregivers the potential benefits and risks of 
influenza vaccination with Afluria in this age group before 
administering this vaccine.
Dosage and administration: All IIV preparations contain 
15 µg of HA per vaccine virus strain (45 µg total for IIV3s and 
60 µg total for IIV4s) per 0.5 mL dose, with two exceptions. 
Fluzone High Dose (Sanofi Pasteur, Swiftwater, Pennsylvania), 
an IIV3 licensed for persons aged ≥65 years, contains 60 µg 
of each HA per vaccine virus strain (180 µg total) (456). 
Fluzone Intradermal Quadrivalent (Sanofi Pasteur, Swiftwater, 
Pennsylvania), an intradermally administered IIV4 licensed for 
persons aged 18 through 64 years, contains 9 µg of each HA 
per vaccine virus strain (36 µg total) (457).
The one IIV product currently licensed by FDA for children 
aged 6 through 35 months contains 0.25 mL/dose, containing 
7.5 µg of HA per vaccine virus strain (Fluzone Quadrivalent; 
Sanofi Pasteur, Swiftwater, Pennsylvania). The 0.25 mL dose 
may be administered from a prefilled single-dose syringe, 
single-use vial, or multi-dose vial of this age-appropriate 
formulation. Children aged 36 months through 18 years, 
and adults receiving IM preparations of IIV, should receive 
a 0.5 mL dose (containing 15 µg of HA per vaccine virus 
strain). If a pediatric vaccine dose (0.25 mL) is administered 
inadvertently to an adult, an additional pediatric dose 
(0.25 mL) should be administered to provide a full adult 
dose (0.5 mL). If the error is discovered later (after the patient 
has left the vaccination setting), an adult dose should be 
administered as soon as the patient can return. Vaccination 
with a formulation approved for adult use should be counted 
as a dose if inadvertently administered to a child.
With the exception of Fluzone Intradermal Quadrivalent 
(Sanofi Pasteur, Swiftwater, Pennsylvania), IIVs are 
administered intramuscularly. For adults and older children, 
the deltoid is the preferred site. Infants and younger children 
should be vaccinated in the anterolateral thigh. Additional 
specific guidance regarding site selection and needle length for 
intramuscular administration are provided in ACIP’s General 
Recommendations on Immunization (8). Fluzone Intradermal 
Quadrivalent is administered intradermally, preferably over 
the deltoid muscle, using the included delivery system (457). 
One IIV3, Afluria (Seqirus, Parkville, Victoria, Australia) 
is licensed for intramuscular administration via jet injector 
(Stratis; Pharmajet, Golden, Colorado) for persons aged 18 
through 64 years (458).
Trivalent versus quadrivalent IIVs: Both trivalent and 
quadrivalent IIVs will be available during the 2016–17 season. 
Quadrivalent vaccines contain one virus from each of the two 
influenza B lineages (one B/Victoria virus and one B/Yamagata 
virus), whereas trivalent vaccines contain one influenza B virus 
from one lineage. Quadrivalent vaccines are thus designed to 
provide broader protection against circulating influenza B 
viruses. However, no preference is expressed for either IIV3 
or IIV4.
IIVs and persons aged ≥65 years: In addition to various 
formulations of standard-dose IIV3 and IIV4, both high-
dose IIV3 (HD-IIV3, available as Fluzone High-Dose) and 
adjuvanted IIV3 (aIIV3, available as Fluad) are approved for 
persons aged ≥65 years. Immunogenicity data from three 
prelicensure studies among persons aged ≥65 years indicated 
that, compared with standard dose Fluzone, Fluzone High-
Dose elicited higher HAI titers against all three influenza virus 
strains included in seasonal influenza vaccines recommended 
during the study period (180–183,456). Subsequently, a 
randomized trial comparing high-dose IIV3 with standard-
dose IIV3 among >31,000 persons aged ≥65 years during the 
2011–12 and 2012–13 seasons found 24.2% greater relative 
efficacy of high-dose vaccine in prevention of LCI associated 
with a protocol-defined ILI (184). Some solicited injection-
site and systemic adverse events were more frequent after 
vaccination with Fluzone High-Dose compared with standard 
Fluzone, but typically were mild and transient (180–183,456).
An MF59-adjuvanted trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine 
(aIIV3; Fluad, Seqirus, Holly Springs, North Carolina) was 
initially approved in the United States in November 2015. 
In prelicensure trials, aIIV3 elicited significantly greater 
antibody responses compared with nonadjuvanted IIV3, 
although predefined superiority criteria were not met (459). 
Reactogenicity, particularly pain, swelling, myalgia, headache, 
and fatigue, were reported more frequently among persons who 
received aIIV3; most of these reactions were mild in severity 
and were transient in nature (459).
No preferential recommendation is made for aIIV3, standard-
dose IIV, or high-dose IIV3 for persons aged ≥65 years. Any 
age-appropriate vaccine may be used.
Contraindications and precautions for the use of IIVs: 
Manufacturer package inserts and updated CDC/ACIP 
guidance should be consulted for current information on 
contraindications and precautions for individual vaccine 
products. In general, history of severe allergic reaction to the 
vaccine or any of its components (including egg) is a labeled 
contraindication to the receipt of IIV (Table 2). However, 
ACIP makes specific recommendations for the use of influenza

vaccine in persons with egg allergy (see Influenza Vaccination 
of Persons with a History of Egg Allergy). Influenza vaccine is 
not recommended for persons with a history of severe allergic 
reaction to the vaccine or to components other than egg. 
Information about vaccine components is located in package 
inserts from each manufacturer. Prophylactic use of antiviral 
agents is an option for preventing influenza among persons 
who cannot receive vaccine.
Moderate or severe acute illness with or without fever is a 
general precaution for vaccination (8). GBS within 6 weeks 
following a previous dose of influenza vaccine is considered a 
precaution for use of influenza vaccines (Table 2).
Recombinant Influenza Vaccine (RIV3)
Available products: One RIV product, Flublok, a trivalent 
recombinant HA vaccine, is available for the 2016–17 influenza 
season. RIV3 is indicated for persons aged ≥18 years. RIV3 is 
manufactured without the use of influenza viruses; therefore, 
similarly to IIVs, no shedding of vaccine virus will occur. No 
preference is expressed for RIV3 versus IIV within specified 
indications.
Dosage and administration: RIV3 is administered by 
intramuscular injection. A 0.5 mL dose contains 45 µg of HA 
derived from each vaccine virus (135 µg total).
Contraindications and precautions for use of RIV: Flublok 
is contraindicated in persons who have had a severe allergic 
reaction to any component of the vaccine. Moderate or severe 
acute illness with or without fever is a general precaution for 
vaccination (8). GBS within 6 weeks following a previous 
dose of influenza vaccine is considered a precaution for use of 
influenza vaccines (Table 2). Flublok is not licensed for use in 
children aged <18 years.
Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (LAIV4)
For the 2016–17 season, ACIP recommends that LAIV4 not 
be used. As it is a licensed vaccine and might be available during 
2016–17, the material in this section is provided for information.
Dosage and administration: LAIV4 is administered 
intranasally using the supplied prefilled, single-use sprayer 
containing 0.2 mL of vaccine. Approximately 0.1 mL (i.e., half 
of the total sprayer contents) is sprayed into the first nostril 
while the recipient is in the upright position. An attached 
dose-divider clip is removed from the sprayer to administer 
the second half of the dose into the other nostril. If the 
vaccine recipient sneezes immediately after administration, 
the dose should not be repeated. However, if nasal congestion 
is present that might impede delivery of the vaccine to the 
nasopharyngeal mucosa, deferral of administration should 
be considered until resolution of the illness, or IIV should be 
administered instead.
Contraindications and precautions: ACIP recommends 
that LAIV4 not be used during the 2016–17 season. Previously 
issued guidance regarding contraindications and precautions 
is provided for informational purposes (Table 2).

Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System 
(VAERS)
The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 requires 
health care providers to report any adverse event listed by the 
vaccine manufacturer as a contraindication to further doses of 
the vaccine, or any adverse event listed in the VAERS Table 
of Reportable Events Following Vaccination (https://vaers.
hhs.gov/resources/VAERS_Table_of_Reportable_Events_

vaccine covered by VICP
. The Vaccine Injury Table (available at 
http://www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation/vaccineinjurytable.
pdf) lists the vaccines covered by VICP and the associated 
injuries and conditions (including death) that might receive 
a legal presumption of causation. If the injury or condition 
is not on the Table, or does not occur within the specified 
time period on the Table, persons must prove that the vaccine 
caused the injury or condition. Eligibility for compensation is 
not affected by whether a covered vaccine is used off-label or 
inconsistently with recommendations.
For a claim to be eligible for compensation under VICP
, 
it must be filed within 3 years after the first symptom of the 
vaccine injury. Death claims must be filed within 2 years of 
the vaccine-related death and not more than 4 years after the 
start of the first symptom of the vaccine-related injury from 
which the death occurred. When a new vaccine is covered by 
VICP or when a new injury/condition is added to the Table, 
claims can be filed within 2 years from the date the vaccine or 
injury/condition is added to the Table for injuries or deaths that 
occurred up to 8 years before the Table change. Persons of all 
ages who receive a VICP-covered vaccine might be eligible to 
file a claim. Additional information is available at http://www.
hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation or by calling 1-800-338-2382.
