Yellow fever virus RNA is usually detected in blood of in-
fected humans. We detected virus RNA in urine and semen 
samples from a convalescent patient. A complete virus ge-
nome was sequenced for an isolate from a urine sample. 
This virus had a South American I genotype and unique sy-
napomorphic changes.
Y
ellow fever virus (YFV) is a member of the genus Fla-
vivirus and causes yellow fever in humans, character-
ized by fever, prostration, and hepatic, renal, and myocar-
dial complications that lead to death in 20%–50% of cases 
(1). Clinical confirmation of YFV infections is based on 
detection of virus RNA in blood by reverse transcription 
PCR or antigen-based ELISAs. Detection of virus in urine 
samples has been used for confirming infections with fla-
viviruses, including West Nile virus (2), Zika virus (3), 
 
dengue virus (4), and YFV (5).
Despite availability of an effective vaccine, >200,000 
cases of yellow fever and >30,000 deaths occur per year 
(6). A large epidemic of yellow fever with high death rates 
recently occurred in Brazil. In December 2016, the first 
cases of yellow fever during this epidemic were reported 
in Minas Gerais; cases were later identified in Espírito 
Santo, Goiás, Mato Grosso, Pará, Rio de Janeiro, São 
Paulo, Tocantins, and the Federal District. There were 792 
confirmed cases and 274 deaths (case-fatality rate 35%) 
as of July 10, 2017 (7). We report a case of yellow fever in 
a 65-year-old man who was a native of São Paulo and had 
not been vaccinated against yellow fever. The study pro-
tocol was approved by the Ethics Committee on Research 
with Human Beings at the University of São Paulo. The 
patient provided informed consent for use of the samples 
during the study.
The patient had traveled to Januária, Minas Gerais, 
Brazil, on December 28, 2016, and to a rural area north of 
São Paulo on January 3, 2017. On January 6, he had fever, 
chills, body pain, and nausea. During days 1–3 after symp-
tom onset, more severe symptoms developed: persistent 
fever (temperature 39.5°C–40°C), headache, body pain, 
prostration, vomiting, dizziness, anorexia, dark stools, dark 
yellow urine, and bitterness in the mouth.
The patient was admitted to a public hospital in Januária 
on January 9. An ELISA for nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) 
of dengue virus showed a negative result. The patient also 
had severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count 77,000/mm3 
[reference range 140,000–450,000/mm3]).
On January 13, the patient returned to São Paulo and 
was admitted to a public hospital. Another ELISA for den-
gue virus NS1 was performed and showed a negative re-
sult. His platelet count decreased to 57,000/mm3. On Janu-
ary 16, the patient was admitted to a reference hospital for 
infectious diseases in São Paulo. He showed a moderate 
clinical presentation: anicteric form and mild spontane-
ous hemorrhage (ecchymosis in the right eye). High fever, 
gastrointestinal symptoms (vomiting and diarrhea), weak-
ness, adynamia, and generalized myalgia were also ob-
served. The patient had a weight loss of 4 kg over 8 days. 
Serum and urine samples were obtained (Figure, panel A; 
online Technical Appendix, https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/EID/
article/24/1/17-1310-Techapp1.pdf).
We extracted virus RNA by using the NucliSENS 
EasyMag Kit (bioMérieux, Marcy l’Étoile, France). We 
tested samples for YFV by using a real-time quantitiative 
reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) and primers specific 
for YFV (8) and a conventional PCR and pan flavivirus 
primers (9). Serum samples showed negative results for 
both PCRs. However, a urine sample obtained 10 days after 
initial symptoms was positive for YFV RNA (cycle thresh-
old [Ct] 17.42, 9.3 × 106 RNA copies/mL) by qRT-PCR. 
We also performed a qualitative IgM-capture ELISA with a 
specific virus antigen and obtained positive results (optical 
density 1.19) (10).
On January 27, we obtained serum, urine, and semen 
samples and tested them by using qRT-PCR. Urine (Ct 
28.57, 3.3 × 103 RNA copies/mL) and semen (Ct 31.00, 5 × 
102 RNA copies/mL) samples were positive for YFV RNA. 
To evaluate infectivity, we tested a urine sample obtained 
on this date (online Technical Appendix). We isolated 
YFV in cell culture, which confirmed virus integrity. We 
also confirmed infectivity after a second virus passage (Ct 
24.35, 6.7 × 104 RNA copies/mL).

RESEARCH LETTERS
For the urine sample that was positive for YFV RNA 
by qRT-PCR, we directly characterized viral diversity by 
using next-generation sequencing (online Technical Ap-
pendix). In South America, phylogenetic studies have in-
ferred 2 circulating YFV genotypes. The isolate from our 
patient (BRMG-2017) clustered with South America I iso-
lates, including 2 viruses isolated in 2017 in Espírito Santo, 
a state bordering Minas Gerais, and other viruses isolated 
previously in Brazil (Figure, panel B).
We did not observe any insertions or deletions in 
BRMG-2017 nucleotide sequences when compared with 
sequences of other South America I strains. However, 
 
several synapomorphic changes were detected (V108I 
[capsid], E1572D [NS3], R1605K [NS3], K2608R [NS5], 
V2645I [NS5], G2680S [NS5], N2804S [NS5], V3150A 
[NS5], and N3216S [NS5]). Most of these changes were lo-
cated in the NS5 (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase) gene, 
which plays a major role in virus replication. Changes in the 
NS5 gene have been associated with differences in viral rep-
lication, immune response, and protein–protein interactions 
during virus replication.
Our results suggest that semen can be a useful clini-
cal material for diagnosis of yellow fever and indicate the 
need for testing urine and semen samples from patients
