Abstract
The sexually transmitted bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae has developed resistance to all
antibiotic classes that have been used for treatment and strains resistant to multiple antibiotic
classes have evolved. In many countries, there is only one antibiotic remaining for empirical
N. gonorrhoeae treatment, and antibiotic management to counteract resistance spread is
urgently needed. Understanding dynamics and drivers of resistance spread can provide an
improved rationale for antibiotic management. In our study, we first used antibiotic resistance
surveillance data to estimate the rates at which antibiotic-resistant N. gonorrhoeae spread in
two host populations, heterosexual men (HetM) and men who have sex with men (MSM).
We found higher rates of spread for MSM (0.86 to 2.38 y−1, mean doubling time: 6 months)
compared to HetM (0.24 to 0.86 y−1, mean doubling time: 16 months). We then developed a
dynamic transmission model to reproduce the observed dynamics of N. gonorrhoeae trans-
mission in populations of heterosexual men and women (HMW) and MSM. We parameter-
ized the model using sexual behavior data and calibrated it to N. gonorrhoeae prevalence
and incidence data. In the model, antibiotic-resistant N. gonorrhoeae spread with a median
rate of 0.88 y−1 in HMW and 3.12 y−1 in MSM. These rates correspond to median doubling
times of 9 (HMW) and 3 (MSM) months. Assuming no fitness costs, the model shows the dif-
ference in the host population’s treatment rate rather than the difference in the number of
sexual partners explains the differential spread of resistance. As higher treatment rates result
in faster spread of antibiotic resistance, treatment recommendations for N. gonorrhoeae
should carefully balance prevention of infection and avoidance of resistance spread.
Author Summary
More and more infectious disease treatments fail because the causative pathogens are resis-
tant to the drugs used for treatment. For the treatment of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, a sexually
transmitted bacterium, drug resistance is a particularly big problem: there is only a single
antibiotic left that is recommended for treatment. We aimed to understand how antibiotic-
resistant N. gonorrhoeae spread in a sexually active host population and how the spread of

 resistance can be slowed. From antibiotic resistance surveillance data, we first estimated the
rate at which antibiotic-resistant N. gonorrhoeae spread. Second, we reproduced the
observed dynamics in a mathematical model describing the transmission between hosts. We
found that antibiotic-resistant N. gonorrhoeae spread faster in host populations of men who
have sex with men than in host populations of heterosexuals. We could attribute the faster
spread of resistant pathogens to higher treatment rates. This finding implies that promoting
screening to control antibiotic-resistant N. gonorrhoeae could in fact accelerate their spread.
Introduction
Antibiotic-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae can evolve and spread rapidly [1]. Resistance is com-
monly observed against the antibiotic classes penicillin, tetracycline and fluoroquinolones [2–4].
Resistance also emerged against cefixime, an oral third generation cephalosporin, in recent
years [2, 3]. Since 2010, cefixime is no longer recommended as first-line treatment [5] following
guidelines from the World Health Organization (WHO) that an antibiotic should not be used
when more than 5% of N. gonorrhoeae isolates are resistant [6]. Injectable ceftriaxone, in combi-
nation with oral azithromycin, is now the last antibiotic remaining as recommended first-line
treatment [7]. Although other antibiotics are being tested for their safety and efficacy for N.
gonorrhoeae treatment [8], no new classes of antibiotics are currently available [4] and manage-
ment of antibiotics is urgently needed to preserve their efficacy. The current management strat-
egy tries to reduce the overall burden of N. gonorrhoeae infection by expanded screening and
treatment of hosts [9, 10], but the outcome of this strategy for resistance is uncertain. Under-
standing the drivers of resistance spread and anticipating future resistance trends will provide
rationales for antibiotic management and help to improve antibiotic treatment strategies.
Men who have sex with men (MSM) are host populations that have higher levels of antibi-
otic-resistant N. gonorrhoeae than heterosexual host populations [3]. In a study [5] based on
the Gonococcal Resistance to Antimicrobials Surveillance Programme (GRASP) in England
and Wales, cefixime-resistant N. gonorrhoeae were mainly found in MSM until 2011. The
authors suggested that cefixime resistance was circulating in a distinct sexual network of highly
active MSM and that bridging between MSM and heterosexuals was necessary for subsequent
spread among heterosexual hosts. However, cefixime-resistant N. gonorrhoeae might have
already been spreading undetected in the heterosexual host population.
Mathematical models can help explain the differential observations of antibiotic-resistant
N. gonorrhoeae in different host populations. In 1978, Yorke et al. [11] introduced the concept
of core groups to model the transmission of N. gonorrhoeae. The concept of core groups posits
that an infection can only be maintained in a host population if a highly sexually active group
of hosts is responsible for a disproportionate amount of transmissions. More recent modeling
studies have examined the transmission of antibiotic-resistant N. gonorrhoeae. Chan et al. [12]
found that prevalence rebounds more quickly to a pre-treatment baseline when treatment is
focused on the core group. Xiridou et al. [13] developed a N. gonorrhoeae transmission model
to determine the impact of different treatment strategies on the prevalence of N. gonorrhoeae
in Dutch MSM. They found that increased treatment rates could increase the spread of resis-
tance, whereas re-treatment could slow it down. Hui et al. [14] used an individual-based N.
gonorrhoeae transmission model in a heterosexual host population to investigate the effect of a
molecular resistance test on the time until 5% resistance are reported. None of these studies has
investigated or explained the differences in the spread of antibiotic-resistant N. gonorrhoeae in
MSM and heterosexual host populations.

Competing Interests: The authors have declared
that no competing interests exist.
 In this study, we investigated the dynamics and determinants of antibiotic-resistant N.
gonorrhoeae spread using surveillance data and mathematical modeling. We estimated the
rates at which resistance spreads in heterosexual men (HetM) and MSM using surveillance
data from the USA and from England and Wales. We then developed a mathematical model of
N. gonorrhoeae transmission to reconstruct the observed dynamics of resistance spread. This
allowed us to determine the major driver of resistance spread, and to explore the expected rates
at which resistance spreads in MSM and heterosexual host populations.
Methods
Data
Data sources.
We used data from the GRASP [15, 16] and the Gonococcal Isolate Surveil-
lance Project (GISP) [17]. GRASP is a program of Public Health England (PHE) that monitors
antibiotic-resistant N. gonorrhoeae in England and Wales. GISP is an equivalent program from
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the USA. We used Plot Digitizer
2.6.6 [18] to digitize data on the proportion of cefixime- and ciprofloxacin-resistant N. gonor-
rhoeae from figures that were published online (see S1 and S2 Tables).
Rate of spread.
We determined the rate of resistance spread by assuming that the propor-
tion of antibiotic-resistant N. gonorrhoeae follows logistic growth. We used the least squares
function nls from the R software environment for statistical computing [19] to fit the following
function to the data:
f ðtÞ ¼
c
1 þ a � expð�btÞ :
f(t) represents the proportion of antibiotic-resistant N. gonorrhoeae at time t, c is the maximal
proportion of antibiotic-resistant N. gonorrhoeae (carrying capacity), a is the ratio between
antibiotic-sensitive and -resistant N. gonorrhoeae at time 0, and b is the rate at which the pro-
portion of antibiotic-resistant N. gonorrhoeae increases in the initial exponential growth phase.
We only used data from the years before the first decline in the proportion of resistant N.
gonorrhoeae because we were interested in the rate of resistance spread during the initial expo-
nential growth phase and while the antibiotic was still used.

 Sen and Res indicate the antibiotic-sensitive and -resistant N. gonorrhoeae strains, G = {L, H} is
the set of low and high sexual activity groups and i 2 G (Fig 1). Each sexual activity group Ni
consists of susceptible hosts, Si, hosts infected with an antibiotic-sensitive strain, ISeni, and hosts
infected with an antibiotic-resistant strain, IResi. To account for individual heterogeneity in sex-
ual behavior [20], hosts are redistributed to either the same or the other sexual activity group at
rate γ. Redistribution is proportional to the size of the sexual activity group, i.e. hosts from the
larger sexual activity group are less likely to change their sexual behavior than hosts from the
smaller sexual activity group. Hosts can also leave or enter the population at rate α. Susceptible
hosts become infected depending on the partner change rate, πi, the transmission probability
per partnership, βij, and the sexual mixing matrix, ρij, which describes how many partnerships
are formed within and outside the host’s activity group:

where δij = 1 if i = j and δij = 0 if i 6¼ j. � is the sexual mixing coefficient [21]. It ranges from 0
(random or proportionate mixing) to 1 (assortative mixing, i.e. all partnerships are formed
with hosts from same group). Hosts infected with an antibiotic-sensitive strain can recover
spontaneously at rate ν or receive treatment at rate τ. Treatment occurs both when the host
seeks treatment for a symptomatic infection or is screened and diagnosed with an asymptom-
atic infection. Hosts receiving treatment recover at rate τ(1 − μ) and develop resistance during
treatment with probability μ. Hosts infected with an antibiotic-resistant strain can only recover
spontaneously at rate ν. We assumed equal fitness of antibiotic-sensitive and -resistant strains
in absence of treatment, i.e. no fitness costs for the antibiotic-resistant strain. We evaluated the
impact of fitness costs on the model outcomes in a sensitivity analysis (see S1 Appendix).
Parameters. Model parameters were estimated from sexual behavior data, calibrated
through model simulation or informed by literature. The partner change rate and the propor-
tions of the host population in each sexual activity group were estimated from the second

 British National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles (Natsal-2) [22], a population-based
cross-sectional survey. For the heterosexual men and women (HMW) model population, we
used the number of new heterosexual partners in the last year of all male and female partici-
pants between 16–44 years who reported never having had a homosexual partner. For the
MSM model population, we used the number of new homosexual partners in the last year of all
male participants between 16–44 years who reported ever having had a homosexual partner.
For each host population, the number of partners per year was weighted with weights provided
in Natsal-2 to adjust for unequal selection probabilities in the survey. We estimated the partner
change rate by assuming that the reported numbers of new sexual partners can be described by
two Poisson distributions with means πL and πH, weighted by the proportion of individuals in
each sexual activity group [23]. For HMW, the sexual partner change rates are πL = 0.25 y−1
and πH = 4.57 y−1 with NH = 6.3% of the population being in the high sexual activity group and
NL = 1 − NH. The obtained partner change rates for MSM are πL = 0.41 y−1 and πH = 30.49 y−1
with NH = 5.3% of the population belonging to the high sexual activity group and NL = 1 − NH.
We calibrated the sexual mixing coefficient, �, the fraction of diagnosed and treated infec-
tions, ϕ, the average duration of infection, D, and the per partnership transmission probabilities
within the low, βLL, and the high sexual activity group, βHH, to N. gonorrhoeae prevalence and
incidence using the following algorithm:
1. Define prior parameter distributions (Table 1).
2. Define the ranges for the expected prevalence and incidence of diagnosed infections
(Table 2) of urethral and cervical N. gonorrhoeae infections for HMW, and urethral, rectal
and pharyngeal infections for MSM.
3. Randomly draw 107 parameters sets from prior distributions.
4. Simulate the transmission model until it approaches a resistance-free (μ = 0) endemic equi-
librium using the ordinary differential equation solver runsteady from the R [19] package
rootSolve [24].
5. Select the parameters sets (posterior distributions) that result in prevalences and incidences
within the defined range.
Information about parameter estimates for N. gonorrhoeae is scarce, so we chose to use
non-informative priors for all parameters except the duration of infection which was informed
by Garnett et al. [25]. The ranges for the expected prevalence and incidence of diagnosed

We assumed that the duration of infection is described by a gamma distribution Γ(k, θ) with shape parameter k = 2 and scale parameter θ = 0.125 y
resulting in an average infectious duration of 0.25 y. Because highly sexually active hosts have fewer sex acts per partnership, we assumed that the
transmission probability within the high activity group cannot be higher than the transmission probability within the low activity group. M and IQR represent
the median and interquartile range of the posterior distributions.

 infections in HMW were based on the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey [26]
and surveillance data [27], both from CDC. For MSM, we used data from the Health in Men
Study in Australia [28, 29]. We compared the model predicted prevalence and incidence of
diagnosed infections to the prevalence and incidence from data without allowing for resistance
in the simulations, because we assumed the data were collected when treatment was mostly
effective. We calculated the model incidence of diagnosed and treated infections for sexual

We set the rate of entering and leaving the population, a ¼ 1
29 y�1, because we only consid-
ered hosts 16–44 years of age. Since the sexual partner change rates are based on the numbers
of new sexual partners within the last year, we assumed that hosts stay on average one year (γ =
1 y−1) in their sexual activity group before they are redistributed to either the same or the other
sexual activity group [30]. We do not have information on the probability of resistance during
treatment. We set the probability of resistance during treatment to μ = 10−3 and performed a
sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of μ on the model outcomes.

 Results
We fitted a logistic growth model to the proportion of antibiotic-resistant N. gonorrhoeae as
observed in the two gonococcal surveillance programs (Fig 2). The proportion of cefixime-
resistant N. gonorrhoeae in GRASP appears to increase for both HetM and MSM after 2006.
Ciprofloxacin-resistant N. gonorrhoeae in HetM and MSM were spreading in all observed host
populations after the year 2000. For a given antibiotic and surveillance program, the rates of
resistance spread were consistently higher for MSM than for HetM (Table 4). The average rate
of resistance spread was 0.53 y−1 for HetM and 1.46 y−1 for MSM, corresponding to doubling
times of 1.3 y (HetM) and 0.5 y (MSM) during the initial exponential growth phase.
Next, we studied the transmission of N. gonorrhoeae and the spread of resistance in the
dynamic transmission model. We calibrated five model parameters to expected prevalence and
incidence in MSM and HMW host populations. The posterior distributions of the parameters
were based on 2,779 parameter sets for HMW and 65,699 parameter sets for MSM (Fig 3,
Table 1). Distributions of the modeled prevalence and incidence of diagnosed infections after
Fig 2. Increase in antibiotic-resistant N.gonorrhoeae. Points show data from antibiotic resistance surveillance programs (GRASP and GISP). Dashed
lines indicate the fit of the logistic growth model to the data. For a given antibiotic and surveillance program, the rates of spread in MSM (green) are
consistently higher than those in HetM (blue).

 calibration are provided as Supporting Information (S1 and S2 Figs, S3 Table). The sexual mix-
ing coefficient showed a tendency towards assortative mixing in both MSM and HMW (Fig
3a). The fraction of diagnosed and treated infections tended to be higher in MSM compared to
HMW (Fig 3b), whereas the infectious duration was considerably shorter in MSM (median: 2.3
months, IQR: 1.7–3.0 months) than in HMW (median: 6.6 months, IQR: 5.5–7.9 months) (Fig
3c). The transmission probabilities per partnership were generally higher in HMW than in
MSM (Fig 3d and 3e).
After calibration, we used the dynamic transmission model to study the spread of antibi-
otic-resistant N. gonorrhoeae. The proportion of antibiotic-resistant N. gonorrhoeae increased
faster in MSM than in HMW (Fig 4). In HMW, the median of all simulations reached 5% resis-
tance in fewer than 4.5 y and 50% resistance in fewer than 7.8 y after appearance of the first
antibiotic-resistant N. gonorrhoeae infection. In the MSM population, the median of all simula-
tions reached a resistance level of 5% in fewer than 1.7 y and 50% in fewer than 2.6 y after resis-
tance first appears in the population. The range spanned by all simulations was much wider in
HMW than in MSM: 95% of all simulations reached the 5% threshold in fewer than 2.7–7.7 y
(HMW), compared with 1.1–2.2 y (MSM).
Antibiotic-sensitive and -resistant N. gonorrhoeae share the same resource for growth, i.e.
the susceptible hosts. The rate at which one strain replaces the other strain in the host popula-
tion is given by the difference in their net growth rates. We assume that the transmission prob-
abilities and the infectious duration of the two strains are the same. Since the probability of
resistance during treatment is very small (μ � 1), the difference in net growth rates between
the strains is approximated by the treatment rate τ and corresponds to the rate of spread of

 antibiotic-resistant N. gonorrhoeae. The observed distributions of treatment rates from the
transmission model hardly overlap between HMW and MSM (Fig 5). The median treatment
rates, i.e. the approximated median rates of resistance spread in the transmission model are
3.12 y−1 (MSM) and 0.88 y−1 (HMW).
We tested whether changes in the probability of resistance during treatment, μ, and fitness
costs in the antibiotic-resistant strain alter the model outcomes. Higher probabilities of resis-
tance during treatment accelerate the establishment of antibiotic-resistant N. gonorrhoeae
in the population and hence reduce the time until 5% resistance is reached (S3 Fig). Higher
probabilities of resistance during treatment, however, do not affect rates of spread, unless the

 probability of resistance during treatment is unrealistically high (10%) (S4 Fig). Fitness costs in
the antibiotic-resistant strain result in rates of resistance spread that are lower than the treat-
ment rate τ (Fig. B in S1 Appendix). Fitness costs that reduce the transmission probability per
partnership, βij, have a stronger effect than fitness costs that reduce the duration of infection.
The effects of fitness costs are independent of the sexual partner change rate, πi, and βij if they
affect the duration of infection, but can vary with πi and βij if they affect the transmission prob-
ability per partnership (Fig. C in S1 Appendix). While high fitness costs can prevent the spread
of antibiotic-resistant strains (Fig. A in S1 Appendix), fitness costs between 0%–10% have only
small effects on the rates of resistance spread (Fig. B in S1 Appendix).
Discussion
In this study, we quantified the rate at which antibiotic-resistant N. gonorrhoeae spread in het-
erosexual and MSM populations. We used data from two different surveillance programs and
estimated that the proportion of ciprofloxacin- and cefixime-resistant N. gonorrhoeae doubles
on average every 1.3 y in HetM and 0.5 y in MSM. The faster spread of antibiotic-resistant N.
gonorrhoeae in MSM than in heterosexual hosts was corroborated using a dynamic transmis-
sion model, which was calibrated to observed prevalence and incidence rates. The model
allowed us to identify the higher treatment rates in MSM, compared with heterosexual hosts, as
the major driver for the faster spread of antibiotic-resistant N. gonorrhoeae.
To our knowledge, this is the first study to have analyzed and interpreted N. gonorrhoeae
antibiotic resistance surveillance data in a dynamic and quantitative manner. The transmission
model was parameterized using sexual behavior data for HMW and MSM from Natsal-2 [22],
a large probability sample survey of sexual behavior. Calibrating the model to observed preva-
lence and incidence rates allowed us to use largely uninformative priors for the model parame-
ters. The calibration makes our model more robust to changes in parameters than using fixed
parameter values, especially since for N. gonorrhoeae available parameter values are very uncer-
tain [31]. It also allowed us to rely on few assumptions about the natural history of N. gonor-
rhoeae infection.
The limitations to our study need to be taken into consideration when interpreting the find-
ings. First, we used data from different sources, although all were collected in high income
countries. The antibiotic resistance surveillance data are from programs in England and Wales
and the USA. The mathematical transmission model was parameterized using British sexual
behavior data [22] and calibrated to prevalence and incidence rates from the USA (HMW) [26,
27] and Australia (MSM) [28, 29]. For simplicity, we modeled the heterosexual and MSM host
populations separately although there is some mixing between them. We assumed the sexual
behavior of heterosexual men and women to be the same and pooled their behavioral data. Sec-
ond, we assumed complete resistance against the antibiotic, i.e. 100% treatment failure. We
further assumed that treatment of the sensitive strain is 100% efficacious. Both assumptions
might explain why antibiotic-resistant N. gonorrhoeae spread at somewhat higher rates in the
dynamic transmission model than estimated from data. Third, we restricted our model to resis-
tance to one antibiotic with no alternative treatment or interventions. This is why we observe
complete replacement of the antibiotic-sensitive strain in the model, a phenomenon that has
not been observed in surveillance data. Fourth, resistance in our model is treated as a generic
trait, but it likely depends on the underlying molecular mechanisms and possibly the genetic
background of the N. gonorrhoeae strain. Different resistance mechanisms might explain some
of the differences in the rates of resistance spread between the model and the different antibiot-
ics from the surveillance data. Fifth, we did not include co- and superinfection with antibiotic-
sensitive and -resistant N. gonorrhoeae strains. Since genetic typing provides evidence for

 mixed infections [32], it is worth speculating how they would affect the rate of spread from the
transmission model. If antibiotic-sensitive and -resistant strains co-existed in a host and acted
independently, we would not expect significant effects on the rate of spread. In contrast, if
there was competition between the two strains within a host, the rate of spread would increase
if the antibiotic-resistant strain outcompetes the -sensitive strain, and decrease otherwise.
Sixth, we do not consider importation of resistance from another population. For example,
importation of resistance from other countries might play a particularly important role during
the early phase of resistance spread, when stochastic events can lead to extinction of the antibi-
otic-resistant strain. We expect that a high rate of importation of antibiotic resistance shortens
the time to reach 5% resistance drastically, but that once the resistant strain is established in
the population, importation hardly affects the rate of resistance spread. Finally, we assumed
that the transmission probabilities per partnership and the durations of infection in the model
represent average values for N. gonorrhoeae infections at different infection sites (urethral, pha-
ryngeal, anal, cervical).
The estimated posterior distributions of the parameters fit within the range of previously
used values, and provide some insights into sexual mixing and the natural history of N. gonor-
rhoeae. The sexual mixing coefficient tends to be assortative for both HMW and MSM host
populations in our model. Quantifying the degree of sexual mixing is difficult and largely
depends on the study population, but our finding is consistent with other studies indicating
assortative sexual mixing in the general population [30, 33]. The posterior estimates of the frac-
tion of diagnosed and treated infections are consistent with the notion that a large proportion
of N. gonorrhoeae infections are symptomatic, and that this proportion is expected to be higher
in men than in women [34–36]. The average duration of infection was the only parameter with
an informative prior, but we found marked differences between the duration of infection in
HMW (6.6 months) and MSM (2.3 months). Per sex act transmission probabilities are gener-
ally considered to be lower from women to men than vice versa [37–39]. In our model, the
median of the transmission probability per partnership was lower in MSM hosts than in HMW
for both sexual activity groups. This could be explained by different numbers of sex acts per
partnership in the two populations. The low transmission probability within the highly active
MSM group (median: 30%) could reflect a single or a small number of sex acts per partnership.
In contrast, the high transmission probability for HMW within the low sexual activity group
(median: 87%) could be a result of a larger number of sex acts per partnership in those individ-
uals. Furthermore, condom use is more frequent in MSM than in HMW [22], which could
explain part of the observed differences in transmission probabilities.
Our study found that the treatment rate is the driving force of resistance spread. Xiridou
et al. [13] found that resistance could spread faster when the treatment rate was higher, but
they did not identify the treatment as the major driver of resistance spread. Chan et al. [12]
found that focusing treatment on the core group leads to a faster rebound to pre-treatment
prevalence than equal treatment of the entire host population. Unfortunately, our findings can-
not be compared with Chan et al. because they do not report the proportion of antibiotic-resis-
tant N. gonorrhoeae.
It was shown previously that treatment is the main selective force acting on resistance evolu-
tion due to the selective advantage to the resistant pathogen [40, 41]. We now expand this
concept by showing that, assuming no fitness costs, treatment rates determine the rates of resis-
tance spread even when the host populations has a heterogeneous contact structure. The intui-
tive argument that a faster spread of an infection, due to a higher number of sexual partners,
will result in a faster spread of resistance does not hold. Instead, the proportion of resistant
infections spreads equally in host populations with different number of partners as long as
they receive treatment at the same rate and there are no fitness costs associated with the

 transmission probability per partnership. For N. gonorrhoeae, this insight challenges the cur-
rent management strategy that aims to lower the overall burden of infection by expanding
screening and treatment of hosts [9, 10]. As soon as antibiotic-resistant pathogens are frequent
enough to evade stochastic extinction, expanded treatment will foster their spread and increase
the burden of N. gonorrhoeae. Additionally, we show that fitness costs can decelerate or even
prevent the spread of antibiotic-resistant N. gonorrhoeae strains. Fitness costs therefore might
explain why highly resistant strains, such as the ceftriaxone-resistant N. gonorrhoeae strain
H041, do not spread in the host population after their first detection [42]. Our findings also
show that bridging between the HetM and the MSM host populations might not have been
necessary for cefixime-resistance to spread in the HetM population after 2010 [5]. It is likely
that cefixime-resistant N. gonorrhoeae had already been present in the HetM population but
were spreading at a lower rate than in the MSM population.
The results of our study will be useful for future N. gonorrhoeae research and for guiding
treatment recommendations. The N. gonorrhoeae transmission model describes observed prev-
alence and incidence rates well and can reconstruct the spread of antibiotic-resistant N. gonor-
rhoeae. Estimating rates of resistance spread is useful for projecting future resistance levels and
the expected time it will take until a certain threshold in the proportion of antibiotic-resistant
N. gonorrhoeae is reached. Until now, treatment recommendations for N. gonorrhoeae are sub-
ject to change when 5% of N. gonorrhoeae isolates show resistance against a given antibiotic
[6]. Our study shows the importance of the rate of spread: a level of 5% resistance results in a
marginal increase to 8% in the following year if resistance spreads logistically at rate 0.53 y−1
(HetM mean estimate from Table 4), but reaches 18% in the next year if resistance spreads at
rate 1.46 y−1 (MSM mean estimate from Table 4). Public health authorities could use surveil-
lance data and adapt thresholds for treatment recommendation change to specific host popula-
tions using the method we describe. Our study challenges the currently prevailing notion that
more screening and treatment will limit the spread of N. gonorrhoeae, as higher treatment rates
will ultimately result in faster spread of antibiotic resistance. Future treatment recommenda-
tions for N. gonorrhoeae should carefully balance prevention of N. gonorrhoeae infection and
avoidance of the spread of resistance.
