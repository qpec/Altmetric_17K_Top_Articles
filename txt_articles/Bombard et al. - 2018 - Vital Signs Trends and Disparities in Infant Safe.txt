Abstract 
Introduction: There have been dramatic improvements in reducing infant sleep-related deaths since the 1990s, when 
recommendations were introduced to place infants on their backs for sleep. However, there are still approximately 3,500 
sleep-related deaths among infants each year in the United States, including those from sudden infant death syndrome, 
accidental suffocation and strangulation in bed, and unknown causes. Unsafe sleep practices, including placing infants in 
a nonsupine (on side or on stomach) sleep position, bed sharing, and using soft bedding in the sleep environment (e.g., 
blankets, pillows, and soft objects) are modifiable risk factors for sleep-related infant deaths.
Methods: CDC analyzed 2009–2015 Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) data to describe infant 
sleep practices. PRAMS, a state-specific and population-based surveillance system, monitors self-reported behaviors and 
experiences before, during, and shortly after pregnancy among women with a recent live birth. CDC examined 2015 
data on nonsupine sleep positioning, bed sharing, and soft bedding use by state and selected maternal characteristics, as 
well as linear trends in nonsupine sleep positioning from 2009 to 2015.
Results: In 2015, 21.6% of respondents from 32 states and New York City reported placing their infant in a nonsupine 
sleep position; this proportion ranged from 12.2% in Wisconsin to 33.8% in Louisiana. Infant nonsupine sleep 
positioning was highest among respondents who were non-Hispanic blacks. Nonsupine sleep positioning prevalence 
was higher among respondents aged <25 years compared with ≥25 years, those who had completed ≤12 years compared 
with >12 years of education, and those who participated in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, 
Infants, and Children during pregnancy.  Based on trend data from 15 states, placement of infants in a nonsupine sleep 
position decreased significantly from 27.2% in 2009 to 19.4% in 2015. In 2015, over half of respondents (61.4%) from 
14 states reported bed sharing with their infant, and 38.5% from 13 states and New York City reported using any soft 
bedding, most commonly bumper pads and thick blankets.
Conclusions and Implications for Public Health Practice: Improved implementation of the safe sleep practices recommended 
by the American Academy of Pediatrics could help reduce sleep-related infant mortality. Evidence-based interventions could 
increase use of safe sleep practices, particularly within populations whose infants might be at higher risk for sleep-related deaths.
Introduction
Approximately 3,500 sleep-related deaths among infants are 
reported each year in the United States, including those from 
sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), accidental suffocation 
and strangulation in bed, and unknown causes (1). Significant 
sociodemographic and geographic disparities in sleep-related 
infant deaths exist (2,3). To reduce risk factors for sleep-related 
infant mortality, recommendations from the American Academy 
of Pediatrics (AAP) for safe sleep include 1) placing the infant in 
the supine sleep position (placing the infant on his or her back) 
on a firm sleep surface such as a mattress in a safety-approved crib 
or bassinet, 2) having infant and caregivers share a room, but not 
the same sleeping surface, and 3) avoiding the use of soft bed-
ding (e.g., blankets, pillows, and soft objects) in the infant sleep 
environment (4). Additional recommendations to reduce the risk 
for sleep-related infant deaths include breastfeeding, providing 
routinely recommended immunizations, and avoiding prenatal and 
postnatal exposure to tobacco smoke, alcohol, and illicit drugs (4).
Although the individual effect of each recommendation on 
sleep-related infant mortality is unclear, sharp declines in SIDS and 
other sleep-related mortality in the 1990s have been attributed to 
an increase in safe sleep practices such as supine sleep. However, 
since the late 1990s declines in infant sleep-related deaths (4) and 
nonsupine sleep positioning (on side or stomach) (5) have been

less pronounced. The rate of infant sleep-related deaths declined 
from 154.6 deaths per 100,000 live births in 1990 to 93.9 per 
100,000 live births in 1999; in 2015, the rate of infant sleep-
related deaths was 92.6 deaths per 100,000 live births (6). Previous 
research indicates implementation of safe sleep recommendations 
by infant caregivers remains suboptimal. In the Study of Attitudes 
and Factors Effecting Infant Care, which interviewed mothers 
2–6 months postpartum during 2011–2014, 22% said they had 
placed their infant in a nonsupine sleep position (7), and 21% 
shared a bed with their infant at least once during the 2 weeks 
before being interviewed (8). In addition, in the National Infant 
Sleep Position Study, a household telephone survey that sampled 
nighttime caregivers during 2007–2010, more than half (54%) 
placed their infant to sleep with soft bedding during the 2 weeks 
before the interview (9).
CDC used data from the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring 
System (PRAMS) to examine the prevalence of unsafe infant sleep 
practices. Ongoing surveillance efforts can identify populations at 
risk for unsafe sleep practices and help evaluate policies and pro-
grams to improve safe sleep practices. Health care providers and 
state-based and community-based programs can identify barriers 
to safe sleep practices and provide culturally appropriate counseling 
and messaging to improve infant sleep practices.
Methods
Data source. PRAMS (10) collects state-specific, population-
based data on self-reported maternal behaviors and experiences 
before, during, and shortly after pregnancy. In each participat-
ing state, a stratified random sample of women with a recent 
live birth is selected from birth certificate files, and women are 
surveyed 2–6 months postpartum using a standardized protocol 
and questionnaire. PRAMS data for each site are weighted for 
sampling design, nonresponse, and noncoverage to produce a data 
set representative of the state’s birth population. PRAMS sites were 
included in this report if their weighted response rate was ≥65% 
for years 2009–2011, ≥60% for 2012–2014, and ≥55% for 2015.
PRAMS sites included the question, “In which position do 
you most often lay your baby down to sleep now?” (check one 
answer): “on side; on back; on stomach.” Respondents who 
selected “on side” or “on stomach” were classified as placing 
their infant in a nonsupine sleep position.* Analyses on non-
supine sleep positioning were conducted using 2015 data from 
32 PRAMS states† and New York City. To explore trends in 
* A small percentage of respondents (<4%) selected more than one sleep position. 
Respondents selecting multiple positions were classified as placing their infant 
in a nonsupine sleep position. Denominator includes supine, on stomach, on 
side only, and combinations of any of the three positions.
† The 32 states include Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, 
Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, 
Michigan, Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico,

nonsupine sleep position, CDC analyzed PRAMS data from 
2009–2015 in 15 states.§ Analyses of bed sharing used 2015 
data from 14 states¶ that included the optional question on their 
state-specific PRAMS survey: “How often does your new baby 
sleep in the same bed with you or anyone else?” Respondents 
who indicated “always,” “often,” “sometimes,” or “rarely” were 
classified as having bed shared and were compared with respon-
dents who indicated “never.” Bed sharing was also categorized 
as: “rarely or sometimes,” and “often or always.” Analyses of soft 
bedding used 2015 data from 13 states** and New York City that 
included the following optional question on their state-specific 
survey: “Listed below are some things that describe how your 
new baby usually sleeps.” Respondents were asked to select “yes” 
or “no” for the following soft bedding items: “pillows,” “thick 
or plush blankets,” “bumper pads,” “stuffed toys” and “infant 
positioner.” Respondents who selected “yes” to one or more 
items were defined as using any soft bedding.
Statistical analysis. The weighted prevalence and 95% confi-
dence intervals of unsafe sleep practices were calculated overall and 
by state for 2015. Chi-square tests and 95% confidence intervals†† 
were used to determine differences in unsafe sleep practices by 
maternal characteristic (i.e., race/ethnicity, age, education level, 
and participation in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program 
for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program during preg-
nancy), gestational age at birth (i.e., preterm, <37 weeks’ gestation, 
compared with term, ≥37 weeks’ gestation) and any breastfeeding 
at 8 weeks postpartum. CDC tested for linear trends in nonsupine 
sleep position overall and by maternal characteristics and state, 
from 2009 to 2015, using logistic regression. Analyses accounted 
for the complex survey sampling design of PRAMS.
Results
In 2015, the overall prevalence of nonsupine sleep posi-
tioning was 21.6%, ranging from 12.2% in Wisconsin to 
33.8% in Louisiana (Table 1). Nonsupine sleep positioning 
varied by maternal characteristics, and was highest among 
respondents who were non-Hispanic blacks. Nonsupine sleep

†† To provide general guidance on the statistical differences, 95% confidence 
intervals (CIs) for the prevalence were compared across groups, with an 
emphasis on identifying differences (i.e., nonoverlap of CIs) between categories 
within the selected variables. This typically conservative approach might fail 
to note differences between estimates more often than formal statistical testing. 
Overlap between confidence intervals does not necessarily mean there is no 
statistical difference between estimates.

positioning prevalence was higher among respondents aged 
<25 years compared with ≥25 years and those who had com-
pleted ≤12 years compared with >12 years of education, and 
who were WIC participants. Among the 15 states examined 
during 2009–2015, nonsupine sleep positioning decreased 
significantly from 27.2% in 2009 to 19.4% in 2015 overall 
(p<0.001) (Supplementary Table https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/
cdc/50001) and in 13 of 15 states (except for Maryland and 
Washington). Nonsupine sleep positioning decreased signifi-
cantly among all age, education, WIC participation and most 
race/ethnicity groups except among respondents who were 
American Indians/Alaska Natives (Figure).§§

In 2015, more than half (61.4%) of respondents reported 
any bed sharing with their infant, with 37.0% reporting 
“rarely or sometimes” and 24.4% responding “often or always” 
bed sharing (Table 2). Self-report of any bed sharing varied 
by state, ranging from 49.0% in West Virginia to 78.9% in 
Alaska. The prevalence of bed sharing varied by maternal 
characteristics, gestational age at birth, and breastfeeding at 
8 weeks postpartum. Bed sharing prevalence was higher among 
respondents who were American Indians/Alaska Natives, non-
Hispanic blacks, or Asians/Pacific Islanders compared with 
non-Hispanic whites or Hispanics, aged <25 years compared 
with ≥25 years, who had completed ≤12 years compared with

Key Points
• Infant safe sleep practices recommended by the American 
Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), including placing infants 
to sleep on their backs, room sharing but not bed sharing, 
and keeping soft objects and loose bedding out of the 
infant’s sleep environment, can help reduce sleep-related 
infant deaths; however, implementation of these 
recommendations remains suboptimal.
• Approximately one in five mothers reported placing 
their infant to sleep on their side or stomach. More 
than one half reported bed sharing with their infant, 
and more than one third reported using soft bedding 
in the infant’s sleep environment. Unsafe sleep practices 
varied by state, race/ethnicity, age, education, and 
participation in the Special Supplemental Nutrition 
Program for Women, Infants, and Children.
• Health care providers and state-based and community-
based programs can identify barriers to safe sleep 
practices and provide culturally appropriate counseling 
and messaging to improve infant safe sleep practices.
• Additional information is available at https://www.cdc.
gov/vitalsigns/.
Use of at least one type of soft bedding was reported by 
38.5% of respondents, ranging from 28.7% in Illinois to 
52.6% in New York City (Table 3). The most frequently 
reported types of soft bedding were bumper pads (19.1%) and 
plush or thick blankets (17.5%), followed by pillows (7.1%), 
infant positioners (6.2%), and stuffed toys (3.1%). Use of at 
least one type of soft bedding varied by maternal characteris-
tics and breastfeeding at 8 weeks postpartum. The prevalence 
of soft bedding use was higher among respondents who were 
Asians/Pacific Islanders or Hispanics compared with members 
of other race/ethnicity groups, aged <25 years compared with 
≥25 years, who had completed ≤12 compared with >12 years 
of education, who were WIC participants, and who were not 
breastfeeding at 8 weeks postpartum (Table 3). 
Conclusions and Comment
Among all mothers responding, 21.6% reported placing 
their infant to sleep in a nonsupine position, 61.4% shared 
their bed with their infant, and 38.5% reported using soft 
bedding. The noted variation observed in nonsupine sleep 
positioning by maternal characteristics is similar to several 
disparities observed in sleep-related death rates (2,3). Sleep-
related infant deaths have been consistently highest among 
American Indian or Alaska Native followed by non-Hispanic 
black mothers (2) and those who are aged <20 years and have

less education (3). Unsafe sleep practices were most commonly 
reported by younger, less educated, and racial/ethnic minor-
ity mothers, suggesting priority groups that might need to be 
reached with clear, culturally appropriate messages.
While most states and subpopulations observed a significant 
decline over time in nonsupine sleep positioning, these findings 
highlight the need to implement and evaluate interventions 
to continue improving safe sleep practices. Evidence-based 
approaches to increase use of safe sleep practices include 
developing health messages and educational tools for caregivers 
and educating health and child care professionals on safe sleep 
practices (11,12). For example, a recent randomized controlled 
trial among postpartum mothers found a 60-day mobile health 
program significantly improved uptake of safe sleep practices. 
The mobile health program included sending frequent emails 
or text messages with short videos related to infant safe sleep 
practices (13). Other strategies include removing known bar-
riers to safe sleep practices (e.g., providing free or reduced cost 
cribs for families), identifying and addressing cultural and 
social practices that are unsafe (e.g., by holding safe-sleep baby 
showers), and implementing legislative and regulatory supports

(e.g., requiring SIDS risk reduction training for licensed child

States and health care providers can play an important 
role in promoting implementation of AAP safe sleep recom-
mendations in a variety of settings. In the Study of Attitudes 
and Factors Effecting Infant Care, 55% of caregivers reported 
receiving appropriate advice, 25% received incorrect advice 
and 20% received no advice on safe sleep practices from 
health care providers. Caregivers who received appropriate 
advice were significantly less likely to place their infants to 
sleep in a nonsupine position than were those who received 
inappropriate or no advice on safe sleep practices (7). In recent 
years, state public health agencies have worked with partners to 
implement a variety of efforts to promote safe sleep, including 
communication campaigns, messaging delivered during WIC 
program visits and home-visiting programs, policies in facilities 
and clinics, and hospital-based quality improvement initia-
tives and collaboratives.¶¶ States aiming to improve safe sleep 
practices can examine successful interventions that have been

US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
implemented in other states. For example, the Massachusetts 
Perinatal-Neonatal Quality Improvement Network imple-
mented a safe sleep initiative in neonatal intensive care units 
that improved safe sleep practices by modeling safe practices 
for parents of medically stable premature infants in advance of 
infant discharge (14).*** The Tennessee Department of Health 
demonstrated that having a hospital policy to correctly model 
safe sleep practices reduced the percentage of infants placed to 
sleep in an unsafe environment (e.g., not on their back) while 
in the hospital by nearly half (15). Finally, state participation in 
national initiatives, such as the National Action Partnership to 
Promote Safe Sleep Improvement and Innovation Network††† 
and Collaborative Improvement and Innovation Network to 
reduce infant mortality,§§§ can help facilitate and monitor the 
use of evidence-based strategies related to safe sleep according 
to standardized metrics of success.
Continued surveillance of infant sleep practices in the 
United States is necessary to monitor whether the prevalence 
of safe sleep practices is improving, especially among popula-
tions where sleep-related infant mortality is disproportionately 
high. The state-specific estimates derived from PRAMS can 
complement other data sources used to assess initiatives to 
reduce sleep-related infant deaths. Of note, CDC also supports 
16 states and two jurisdictions through its Sudden Unexpected 
Infant Death (SUID)¶¶¶ Case Registry to monitor sleep-related 
deaths and related circumstances, including the sleep environ-
ment. This surveillance effort, which captures 30% of all SUID 
cases in the United States, focuses on improving data quality 
and completeness of SUID investigations to inform strategies 
to reduce sleep-related deaths (16).****
The findings in this report are subject to at least three limi-
tations. First, results are limited to states that implemented 
PRAMS, met the required response rate threshold for inclusion 
in data analysis, and included questions regarding safe sleep 
practices on their state-specific PRAMS survey. Second, AAP 
recommends placing the infant to sleep in the supine position 
every time; however, the PRAMS survey only asked respon-
dents the sleep position their infant was placed most often. 
Also, prior to 2016, PRAMS collected data on the unsafe prac-
tice of bed sharing, but not on the AAP-recommended practice

of room sharing. Finally, PRAMS data are self-reported and 
might be subject to both recall and social desirability biases.
Despite recommendations from AAP regarding safe sleep prac-
tices for infants, this report demonstrates that placement of infants 
in a nonsupine sleep position, bed sharing with infants, and use of 
soft bedding are commonly reported by mothers. Evidence-based 
interventions that encourage infant safe sleep practices by caregivers, 
particularly within populations where unsafe infant sleep practices 
are higher, could help reduce sleep-related infant mortality.
