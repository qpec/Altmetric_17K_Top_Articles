Methods
and results
A total of 230 670 women and 190 057 men free from prevalent cancer and cardiovascular disease were included
from UK Biobank. Usual walking pace was self-defined as slow, steady/average or brisk. Handgrip strength was
assessed by dynamometer. Cox-proportional hazard models were adjusted for social deprivation, ethnicity,
employment, medications, alcohol use, diet, physical activity, and television viewing time. Interaction terms investi-
gated whether age, body mass index (BMI), and smoking status modified associations. Over 6.3 years, there were
8598 deaths, 1654 from cardiovascular disease and 4850 from cancer. Associations of walking pace with mortality
were modified by BMI. In women, the hazard ratio (HR) for all-cause mortality in slow compared with fast walkers
were 2.16 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.68–2.77] and 1.31 (1.08–1.60) in the bottom and top BMI tertiles,
respectively; corresponding HRs for men were 2.01 (1.68–2.41) and 1.41 (1.20–1.66). Hazard ratios for cardiovas-
cular mortality remained above 1.7 across all categories of BMI in men and women, with modest heterogeneity in
men. Handgrip strength was associated with cardiovascular mortality in men only (HR tertile 1 vs. tertile 3 = 1.38;
1.18–1.62), without differences across BMI categories, while associations with all-cause mortality were only seen in
men with low BMI. Associations for walking pace and handgrip strength with cancer mortality were less consistent.
...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusion
A simple self-reported measure of slow walking pace could aid risk stratification for all-cause and cardiovascular
mortality within the general population.

Introduction
Physical fitness, composed of cardiorespiratory fitness and muscle
strength, is an important predictor of mortality and an established tar-
get for cardiovascular disease prevention.1–3 Cardiorespiratory fitness,
in particular, has shown a strong graded association with the risk of all-
cause and cardiovascular mortality and is advocated as a clinical vital
sign with importance for risk classification.1,4 Therefore, pragmatic
methods of harnessing cardiorespiratory fitness for risk stratification
are warranted. Studies have found an association between objectively
assessed walking pace and mortality, mostly in older adult,5–7 with
other studies suggesting self-reported walking pace may act as an
important marker of cardiovascular health.8,9 Thus, self-reported walk-
ing pace could function as a pragmatic measure of physical fitness and a
simple index of mortality risk. However, in order to have clinical and
public health relevance, research is needed to examine the extent to
which pragmatic self-reported measures of walking pace are associated
with cardiorespiratory fitness and whether the associations with all-
cause and cause-specific mortality are maintained after adjustment for
potential confounding variables or vary across potential effect modi-
fiers such as age, smoking status, or body mass index (BMI).
Muscle strength is also an important and reproducible measure
of physical fitness and has been associated with all-cause and cardiovas-
cular mortality.2 Handgrip strength is correlated with overall
muscle strength and is associated with functional and health outcomes
including frailty, falls, nutritional status and mortality.10–15 Investigating
whether associations persist after adjustment for other pragmatic
measures of physical fitness, such as walking pace, and maintained
across potential effect modifiers will further help elucidate the potential
clinical importance of handgrip strength within the general population.
The aim of this analysis was to quantify the associations of self-
reported walking pace and handgrip strength with all-cause, cardio-
vascular, and cancer mortality in men and women from UK Biobank
and to investigate whether associations are maintained across catego-
ries of age, BMI, and smoking status.
Methods
UK Biobank
This analysis used data from 502 639 participants within UK Biobank, the
methods and aim of which have been reported elsewhere.16 In brief, UK
Biobank is a large prospective cohort of middle-aged adults designed to
support biomedical analysis focused on improving the prevention, diagno-
sis, and treatment of chronic disease. Between March 2006 and July 2010,
individuals living within 25 miles of one of the 22 study assessment
centres located throughout England, Scotland, and Wales were recruited
and provided comprehensive data on a broad range of demographic, clini-
cal, lifestyle, and social outcomes. All participants provided written
informed consent and the study was approved by the NHS National
Research Ethics Service (Ref: 11/NW/0382).
For each variable reported in this analysis, we provide the UK Biobank
Data-Field (DF) number. Each DF is linked to detailed information on
measurement procedures through the UK Biobank website.17
Measures of physical function
The primary exposures of interest were self-reported walking pace and
objectively assessed handgrip strength. Walking pace was assessed by the
following single item question: ‘How would you describe your usual walk-
ing pace? (i) Slow pace, (ii) Steady/average pace, and (iii) Brisk pace’ (DF
924). Handgrip strength was assessed through the use of a hydraulic hand
dynamometer (Jamar J00105) while sitting (DF 46 and 47). The elbow of
the arm holding the dynamometer was placed against the side of the
body and bent to a 90� angle with the forearm placed on an armrest.
Participants were instructed to squeeze the handle of the dynamometer
as hard as they could for 3 s. Both left and right hand strengths were
measured. The values for the right and left hand were summed and div-
ided by 2 to estimate an average.
Cardiorespiratory fitness
A subsample of UK Biobank undertook a 6 min graded submaximal fitness
test on a cycle ergometer (DF 6025). We utilized data from this subsam-
ple to inform the main analyses by investigating the association of cardior-
espiratory fitness with walking pace and handgrip strength. The start and
end workload of the graded fitness test was set according to age, height,
weight, resting heart rate, and sex to ensure a similar relative intensity
across the population. Heart rate was monitored before, during, and
after the exercise test via a four-lead electrocardiogram. Maximal cardior-
espiratory fitness was estimated by: (i) Fitting a linear regression line
between heart rate and power output for each stage of the test; (ii) The
regression line was extrapolated to the age-predicted maximal heart
rate with the formula 208 - 0.7� age18; (iii) Maximal oxygen uptake
was estimated from the regression equation for the relationship
between work rate (power) and oxygen uptake [oxygen uptake
(mL�kg-1�min-1) = 7 þ [10.8� work rate (Watts)]/body mass (kg)].19
Individuals without cancer and cardiovascular disease who completed at
least one stage of the fitness test were included for this sub-analysis
(n = 51282).
Data on potential confounders,
mediators, and effect modifiers
This study utilized the following covariates: anthropometric (BMI); demo-
graphic [age, sex, ethnicity, social deprivation (Townsend index), and
employment status]; health (number of medications); and lifestyle [smok-
ing (never, past, current), alcohol, diet, television (TV) viewing time, and
self-reported physical activity]. Diet was assessed through a food fre-
quency questionnaire; alcohol (DF 1558), fresh fruit (DF 1309), cooked
vegetable (DF 1289), and processed meat (DF 1349) were included.
Physical activity was assessed as weekly frequency of walking (DF 864),
moderate (DF 884), or vigorous (DF 904) intensity physical activity lasting
at least 10min in duration. Further details for each variable are available
on the UK Biobank Website.20
Mortality status follow-up
UK Biobank undertook comprehensive data linkage for mortality status.
Date and cause of death were obtained from the National Health Service
(NHS) Information Centre for participants from England and Wales, and
from the NHS Central Register, Scotland, for participants from Scotland.
Detailed information about the linkage procedure is available online.20
Linkage captured all deaths occurring until 31 January 2016 for England
and 30 November 2015 for Scotland. We defined cancer and cardiovas-
cular disease mortality using the International Classification of Diseases
edition 10 (ICD-10): C00-C97 for cancer death and I00-I79 for cardiovas-
cular death.
Participants included
From the initial sample of 502639 participants, those with prevalent can-
cer [number of self-reported cancers (DF 134); n= 41 706] or prevalent
cardiovascular disease [defined as myocardial infarction, stroke, or angina

(DF 6150); n= 27 573] were excluded from the analysis. From the remain-
ing sample, only subjects with information available for all covariates were
included (missing data were less than 2% for all included covariates), leav-
ing 420 727 individuals who at baseline were free from cancer and cardio-
vascular disease and had complete walking pace, handgrip strength (both
left and right measures) and covariate data (see Supplementary material
online, Figure S1).
Statistical analysis
In the subsample with cardiorespiratory fitness data, the association
between walking pace, handgrip strength, and cardiorespiratory fitness
was tested using analysis of variance models adjusted for age and stratified
by sex.
In the full cohort, Cox-proportional hazard models were used to
investigate the association of walking pace and handgrip strength with
mortality using age as time scale. Handgrip strength was categorized
into sex-specific tertiles and separate models were undertaken for all-
cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and cancer mortality. The
proportional hazards assumption was verified for all variables by
inspection of the plots of the Schoenfeld residual for covariates.
Models were arranged a priori to investigate the impact of incremental
adjustment. Model 1 was unadjusted. Model 2 adjusted for ethnicity,
social deprivation, employment status, and number of prescribed
medications. Model 3 additionally adjusted for smoking, alcohol con-
sumption, and fruit, vegetable, and processed meat intake. Model 4
additionally adjusted for BMI, TV viewing, and frequency of walking,
moderate intensity, and vigorous intensity physical activity. Lastly,
Model 5 was additionally mutually adjusted for walking pace and hand-
grip strength. For the regression models including all covariates in
Model 4 plus walking pace or handgrip strength, the C-indexes were
calculated and calibration plots displayed.
Interaction terms were fitted to Model 5 to assess whether BMI (as
tertiles), age (tertiles), and smoking (never, past, current) modified associ-
ations with mortality; in addition, the interaction between walking pace
and grip strength was also tested. A sensitivity analysis was also con-
ducted to investigate the effect of removing all deaths occurring within
the first 24months of follow-up (women= 424, men= 797) to reduce
the possible impact of reverse causation.
All analyses were performed with Stata V14.1 (Stata Corporation,
College Station, TX, USA). Results stratified by sex are reported with
95% confidence interval; a two-sided P-value < 0.05 was considered stat-
istically significant.
Results
The mean (range) age of included participants was 56.4 (38.9–
73.7)years. The distribution of the categorical covariates for the
230670 women and 190057 men included in the analyses are dis-
played in Figure 1. Table 1 shows BMI, age, and mean handgrip

strength values across categories of walking pace and handgrip
strength. Categories of walking pace were similarly distributed
between men and women. However, mean values of handgrip
strength for sex-specific tertiles showed little overlap between men
and women; those in the highest tertile for women had a mean
(standard deviation) value of 30.4 (3.3) kg whereas men in the lowest
tertile had a mean value of 30.6 (4.9) kg (Table 1).
In the subsample who undertook the fitness test, self-reported
walking pace showed a strong graded association with cardiorespira-
tory fitness in men and women (Table 2). Slow walkers achieved an
average fitness level of 28.1 (95% CI: 27.7–28.6) mL�kg-1�min-1 and
35.9 (35.3–36.5) mL�kg-1�min-1 in women and men, respectively;

tively. Associations between handgrip strength and cardiorespiratory
fitness were less pronounced.
Table 3 reports the number of deaths for men and women by
walking pace group and tertile of handgrip strength. During a median
(interquartile range) follow-up of 6.3 [7.0–7.6] years [2 926 917
person-years], 8598 (2.0%) all-cause deaths, 4850 (1.2%) cancer
deaths, and 1654 (0.4%) cardiovascular deaths occurred. The number
of all-cause, cancer, and cardiovascular deaths were greater in men
(5184, 2682, and 1188, respectively) than women (3414, 2168, and
466 respectively).

The hazard ratios (HRs) for walking pace and handgrip strength
are shown graphically in Figure 2 with corresponding estimates pre-
sented in Supplementary material online, Tables S1 and S2. Walking
pace was associated with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, but
not cancer mortality, in women and men across all models. Handgrip
strength was associated with cardiovascular mortality in men and
with all-cause mortality in women and men, although results for
women were attenuated after removing deaths occurring within the
first 24 months. Handgrip strength was not associated with cancer
mortality in women, whereas in men a weaker handgrip appeared to
be associated with a lower risk of cancer, particularly after removing
deaths
occurring
within
the
first
24 months
(Figure
2
and
Supplementary material online, Table S2).
Body mass index was found to modify associations for walking pace
in men and women and handgrip strength in men. Interaction tests
and stratified results are displayed in Figure 3. For women, the HR for
all-cause mortality in slow walkers compared with fast walkers ranged
from 2.16 (1.68–2.77) to 1.31 (1.08–1.60) for participants in the bot-
tom and top BMI tertiles, respectively. Corresponding HRs for men
were 2.01 (1.68–2.41) and 1.41 (1.20–1.66). Hazard ratios for cardio-
vascular mortality for slow walkers compared with fast walkers
remained above 1.7 across all categories of BMI in men and women,
with a modest heterogeneity in men. A slow walking pace was also
associated with cancer mortality in women and men with low BMI.
Weak handgrip strength was only associated with a higher risk of all-
cause mortality in men with low BMI (1.29; 1.13–1.48) whereas associ-
ations between handgrip strength and cardiovascular mortality were
not affected by BMI status.
Interaction analysis revealed the association of walking pace with
all-cause (P = 0.572 for women; P = 0.626 for men) and cardiovascu-
lar mortality (P = 0.068 for women; P = 0.634 for men) was not modi-
fied by handgrip strength or vice-versa. In addition, the association of
walking pace and handgrip strength with all-cause or cardiovascular
morality was not modified by age or smoking status.
The C-indexes for the most adjusted models containing walking
pace or handgrip strength demonstrated moderate discrimination
(ranging from 0.63 to 0.71), with good calibration (Supplementary
material online, Figure S2).
Discussion
Within a large national sample of UK adults free from cancer and car-
diovascular disease, a simple measure of self-perceived walking pace
was associated with a higher risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mor-
tality; the strength of association persisted after adjustment for hand-
grip strength and was modified by levels of BMI. For those with low
BMI, slow walkers had over twice the risk of cardiovascular and all-
cause mortality compared with fast walkers in men and women.
Associations were weaker at higher levels of BMI, yet slow walkers
still had over 1.7 times the risk of cardiovascular mortality compared
with fast walkers. Handgrip strength was not consistently associated
with mortality in women, whereas in men a weak handgrip was asso-
ciated with a higher risk of all-cause mortality within the lowest tertile
of BMI and with cardiovascular mortality across all categories of BMI.
There was no clear pattern of association of walking pace or handgrip
strength with cancer mortality, although a slow walking pace was
associated with a higher risk of cancer mortality in women and men
with low BMI.
The strength of association of self-reported walking pace with all-
cause mortality reported in the present study is consistent with pre-
vious research in smaller cohorts using objective measures, primarily
in older adults. A recent meta-analysis including a total of 12 901 sub-
jects across 9 studies reported a higher risk of all-cause mortality for
the slowest walkers compared with the fastest walkers (HR = 1.89
[1.46–2.46]) when measured objectively.6 The Whitehall II study
reported a similar finding in middle-aged adults.5 Other studies have
also investigated the association between self-reported walking pace
and cardiovascular events in occupational cohorts.8,9,21 For example,
in the Women’s Health Study of health care professionals in the USA
and Puerto Rico, those reporting a fast walking pace had around half
the risk of a cardiovascular event compared with slow walkers.9

Similar results were seen for men in the Health Professionals’ Follow-
up Study.8 Self-reported measures of physical fitness have also been
associated with frailty and health outcomes in community dwelling
cohorts or older adults.22,23
Our findings extend previous evidence by reporting the novel find-
ing that a simple semi-quantitative measure of walking pace that asks
individuals to rate their walking pace as slow, steady/average, or brisk
is associated with objectively measured cardiorespiratory fitness and
by evidencing that this simple measure is associated with mortality
within the general population. A further novel finding revealed the
strength of the association of walking pace with all-cause (men and
women), cardiovascular (men), and cancer (men) mortality was
modified by BMI, with stronger associations seen in the lowest tertile
of BMI. Low levels of BMI are associated with malnutrition and higher
levels of sarcopenia,24,25 therefore our results suggest the potential
importance of self-reported walking pace in differentiating between
healthy and unhealthy forms of low BMI.
Associations between handgrip strength and mortality are some-
what weaker than those reported in smaller studies which did not
stratify by sex.13,26,27 As this study demonstrated, there is very little
overlap in the distribution of handgrip strength between men and
women. Therefore, conventional methods of adjustment for sex may
not fully account for this difference.
This study did not find a clear pattern of association for walking
pace or handgrip strength with the risk of cancer mortality in men or
women. However, unexpectedly a weaker handgrip appeared to be

associated with a slightly lower risk of cancer in men, a finding that
was strengthened after removing deaths occurring within the first
24months. To date, the literature in this area has been discrepant.
Some studies have reported an association between higher levels of
physical fitness and lower cancer mortality risk,2,28–30 while others
have reported no association despite finding clear associations with
cardiovascular mortality.14,15,31 Of note, another large population
study also reported the finding that weaker handgrip strength was
associated with a lower risk of cancer mortality.13 The equivocal
nature of the evidence may reflect factors like age and the predomi-
nant types of cancer within the measured population; however, based
on this study and the literature to date it is likely that simple indices
of physical performance, such as walking pace and handgrip strength,
are more reflective of cardiovascular health within the general popu-
lation. The lower risk of cancer mortality with lower muscular
strength reported for men in this study and in men and women in
another large study warrants further investigation.13
Our results are supported by interventional research. Physical fit-
ness, which was strongly associated with walking pace in the present
study, is modifiable with exercise training. Although inter-individual
responses to exercise training are heterogeneous, the majority gain
some improvement. For example, in a population of healthy, pre-frail,
and frail older adults (>65years), all individual increased their
functional capacity following an exercise intervention.32 Other stud-
ies have shown that the majority of adults respond with increased
cardiorespiratory fitness following aerobic exercise training.33,34
Importantly, exercise training has also been shown to reduce the
risk of chronic disease and improve cardiometabolic risk factors,35
including type 2 diabetes,36 blood pressure,37,38 and cholesterol.39
The fact that physical fitness is modifiable through exercise interven-
tion and that exercise interventions in turn improve health status
provide a robust mechanism that supports the association between
measures of physical fitness and cardiovascular mortality reported in
this study.
The
present
study
has
important
strengths,
including
the
large sample size and number of deaths which allowed stratification by
sex. The extensively phenotyped population also allowed a compre-
hensive investigation into possible confounding or mediating influences
on the association between walking pace, handgrip strength and mor-
tality. However, important limitations remain. Although participants
with cancer, myocardial infarction, stroke, or angina were excluded
from the analysis, other potentially relevant conditions, such as a his-
tory of coronary artery bypass grafting or revascularization were not
captured and reverse causality remains a possible explanation of our
findings, including the interactions with BMI. Moreover, although we
adjusted for a wide range of demographic, clinical and lifestyle factors,
many covariates were self-reported, thus residual confounding due
limited measurement precision also remains a possibility. This analysis
was also limited to mortality end points.
Conclusions
In conclusion, this study found that a slow self-reported walking pace
was associated with a higher risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mor-
tality in women and men with associations remaining robust across
multiple layers of adjustment. Associations were stronger in those
with low BMI. Self-reported walking pace could therefore represent

an important measure of physical fitness with potential applicability
for risk stratification within the general population, particularly those
presenting with low BMI. Future research is needed to investigate the
extent to which walking pace can be used to improve the prognostic
performance of common cardiovascular risk scores across different
categories of BMI. Compared with self-reported walking pace, hand-
grip strength appeared to be a less generalizable marker of risk within
the general population.

A 64-year-old patient with diabetes and hypertension was
planned for atrioventricular nodal re-entry tachycardia ablation.
Besides palpitations, he experienced no complaints of angina or
dyspnoea.
As part of the routine work-up for the ablation, a transthora-
cic echocardiogram was performed (Panel A). A spherical, echo-
genic structure (*) of 31mm was seen with an echodense
border, partly near the tricuspid valve. We considered it to be a
calcified
thrombus,
a
tumour
or a
coronary
aneurysm.
Transoesophageal echocardiogram (Panel B) showed the second
aneurysm (D). Computerized tomography (CT) revealed two
aneurysms of the right coronary artery with thrombi, correlating
with the structures on the echocardiograms (Panel D). This was
confirmed via coronary angiography (Panel C).
Giant coronary artery aneurysms are uncommon and may be
congenital or acquired. Most aneurysms are seen in the right cor-
onary artery and are associated with three vessel coronary artery
disease as in this patient. Atherosclerosis accounts for 50% of
aneurysms in adult cases. Besides atherosclerosis, no other aeti-
ology could be identified in this patient.
A coronary artery bypass grafting was performed. Alternative
surgical treatments of aneurysms are ligation, resection or stent-
ing. These may be complicated by ventricular fibrillation and myocardial infarction. Also fistulas and right ventricular outflow tract obstruc-
tion are described, but were not found in our patient. Pragmatically, vitamin K antagonist was subscribed for 3 months to minimalize the
