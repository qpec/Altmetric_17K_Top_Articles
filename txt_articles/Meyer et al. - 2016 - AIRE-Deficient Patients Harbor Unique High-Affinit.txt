SUMMARY
APS1/APECED patients are defined by defects in the
autoimmune regulator (AIRE) that mediates central
T cell tolerance to many self-antigens. AIRE defi-
ciency also affects B cell tolerance, but this is incom-
pletely understood. Here we show that most APS1/
APECED patients displayed B cell autoreactivity to-
ward unique sets of approximately 100 self-proteins.
Thereby, autoantibodies from 81 patients collectively
detected many thousands of human proteins. The
loss of B cell tolerance seemingly occurred during
antibody affinity maturation, an obligatorily T cell-
dependent step. Consistent with this, many APS1/
APECED patients harbored extremely high-affinity,
neutralizing autoantibodies, particularly against spe-
cific cytokines. Such antibodies were biologically
active in vitro and in vivo, and those neutralizing
type I interferons (IFNs) showed a striking inverse
correlation with type I diabetes, not shown by other
anti-cytokine antibodies. Thus, naturally occurring
human autoantibodies may actively limit disease
and be of therapeutic utility.
INTRODUCTION
T lymphocyte tolerance is essential for limiting autoimmune dis-
ease. Tolerance occurs ‘‘centrally’’ when developing thymocytes
with strongly self-reactive T cell receptors (TCRs) are deleted
following engagement of self-antigen-derived peptides pre-
sented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens.
The expression of thousands of tissue-specific self-antigens
(TSAs) by medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTEC) is directly pro-
moted by AIRE, a poorly understood transcriptional regulator
(Mathis and Benoist, 2009; Klein et al., 2014). Reflecting its
importance, AIRE deficiency is defined by the APS1/APECED
syndrome for which autoimmune polyendocrinopathy and
chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis are pathognomonic (Nag-
amine et al., 1997).
There are also several mechanisms of peripheral T cell toler-
ance, including requirements for co-stimulatory signals for the
activation of naive T cells; the expression of molecular ‘‘brakes’’
(e.g., CTLA-4, PD-1) by activated T cells; and the suppression of
effector T cells in trans by FOXP3-expressing T-regulatory
(T-reg) cells. Reflecting its importance, FOXP3 deficiency is
defined by early-onset, life-threatening autoimmunity (Bennett
et al., 2001; Wildin et al., 2001).
Central and peripheral tolerance mechanisms have likewise
been hypothesized to shape the B cell compartment. Thus,
self-reactive B cells developing in the bone marrow may be
censored by clonal deletion, clonal anergy, or B cell receptor
(BCR) editing in which secondary gene rearrangements replace
the initial BCR with a new specificity (Goodnow et al., 2010; Pillai
et al., 2011; U
¨ belhart and Jumaa, 2015). Peripheral B cell toler-
ance is less well characterized, although some checkpoints
have been inferred. For example, immature transitional B cells
recently emigrated from the bone marrow contain many autor-
eactive and polyreactive cells, whereas there are relatively few
among mature naive B cells, strongly suggesting that tolerance
is imposed as transitional B cells differentiate into naive B cells
(Wardemann et al., 2003).
Interestingly, this B cell checkpoint is T cell dependent, as re-
flected by its impairment in patients with T-reg deficiencies
(Kinnunen et al., 2013). Likewise, CD40L and MHC class II
deficiencies that each impair T-B interactions also display
more autoreactive B cells (Meffre and Wardemann, 2008). These

 considerations raise the possibility that B cell tolerance is largely
governed by the state of T cell tolerance.
Certainly, any autoreactive B cell that might progress through
to the naive B cell compartment of a healthy individual should
lack cognate autoreactive T cells to help it mature. Likewise,
T cell help is required in the germinal center (GC) reaction in
which B cells undergo somatic hyper-mutation (SHM) of the
immunoglobulin (Ig) variable (V) region genes, thereby driving
T cell-dependent selective expansion of clones with increased
antigen affinity (Brink, 2014). The question that then arises is
whether major defects in central T cell tolerance provoke wide-
ranging losses of B cell tolerance at either or both of these
stages.
An approach to assessing this is to examine B cell reactivities
in AIRE-deficient APS1/APECED patients whose under-expres-
sion of TSAs in the thymus is predicted to lead to increased
numbers of peripheral autoreactive T cells. Thus, there are re-
ports of APS1/APECED patients carrying autoantibodies against
twenty-five TSAs, with prevalence ranging from 6% to 69%
(Kisand and Peterson, 2015). Their specificities include steroido-
genic enzymes, consistent with the patients’ polyendocrinopa-
thies (Krohn et al., 1992; Uibo et al., 1994; Winqvist et al.,
1993). In addition, most patients display autoreactivities toward
type I IFNs and T helper (Th)-17-related cytokines, antibodies to
which limit resistance to Candida infection (Kisand et al., 2010;
Meager et al., 2006; Puel et al., 2010).
These findings notwithstanding, there has been no large-scale
analysis of the scope and nature of autoantibodies in APS1/
APECED patients, thereby resolving how T cell tolerance im-
pacts upon B cell tolerance in humans. By analyzing 81 APS1/
APECED patients, we found that each was much more likely
than a healthy relative or an unrelated control to harbor strong
serum reactivities toward �100 human proteins. About 10 of
those, including type I IFNs and interleukin-22 (IL22), were
recognized by almost all patients, whereas others were mostly
‘‘private specificities.’’ Hence, 81 patients collectively harbored
antibodies toward >3,700 human proteins.
Focusing on antibodies to type I IFNs, IL22, and IL17, we
found unexpectedly that most were reactive to conformational
determinants and included highly mutated antibodies of sub-
picomolar affinity. Because their gemline counterparts were
not self-reactive, B cell autoreactivity was most probably
driven by self-reactive T cells in the GC reaction. The autoanti-
bodies commonly neutralized their targets in vivo, and APS1/
APECED patients with signature type 1 diabetes (T1D)-associ-
ated antibodies (e.g., anti-GAD65) commonly failed to develop
T1D so long as they harbored powerfully neutralizing IFNa-spe-
cific antibodies. Thus, autoantibodies naturally arising in sub-
jects with defective central T cell tolerance may be disease
ameliorating.
RESULTS
High-Titer Autoreactivities in APS1/APECED
Sera from 81 APS1/APECED patients from discrete Finnish, Nor-
wegian, Slovenian, and Sardinian cohorts were directed against
a ProtoArray displaying �9000 immobilized recombinant human
proteins or protein fragments. Because some patients were
sampled longitudinally, 97 sera were assayed in total. Control
sera were from healthy first-degree relatives (n = 9) and healthy
unrelated volunteers (n = 12) across the same age range. Data
readouts for the binding of individual sera were normalized by
applying robust linear modeling (Sboner et al., 2009), whereafter
each signal was assigned a Z score denoting the number of stan-
dard deviations (SD) above or below the mean of the combined
healthy relatives and controls.
Most patients and the combined controls displayed Z scores
of 1–2 for �200 proteins (Figure 1A). However, when the conven-
tion was employed of defining Z R 3 as bona fide positives, the
patients segregated from the two control cohorts, considered
either jointly or separately. Thus, each control serum displayed
reactivities of Z R 3 toward an average of %20 proteins, with
most recognizing < 10 (Figures 1A, 1B, and S1A). Given that
there was inter-individual variation, the 21 control sera collec-
tively displayed Z R 3 reactivities toward 406 distinct proteins,
i.e., �5% of those displayed on the array (Figure 1B). For only
2 proteins was Z R 4, and for none was Z R 5 (Figures 1A and
1B). Hence, as expected, the control cohorts largely lacked
high-titer serum autoreactivities.
Conversely, most patients at any one time displayed Z R 3
autoreactivities toward R 80 proteins (Figures 1A, 1B, and
S1A). These data were re-analyzed with stringent procedures
to minimize false-positives, including exclusion of any signals
that might have arisen from cross-sample print contamina-
tion. With this achieved, the patients’ ‘‘private’’ autoantibody
repertoires collectively detected 3,731 distinct targets (Fig-
ure 1B). Furthermore, almost all patients displayed Z R 4
scores for at least 10 proteins (mean of �30), collectively
recognizing > 1,500 proteins, and > 50% of patients displayed
Z R 5 scores for R 10 proteins (mean of > 12), collectively
recognizing 636 proteins (Figures 1A and 1B). Hence, high-level
reactivity toward multiple self-proteins was a disease-defining
property. This was further illustrated by the qualitative differ-
ence in Z score distribution curves for patients versus controls,
which cannot simply be explained by there being 5-fold more
patient sera (Figure 1C). Thus, whereas sampling greater
numbers would likely have increased the protein species de-
tected by control cohorts at Z R 4, it would not bridge the
1,000-fold gap between two proteins detected by 21 control
sera versus > 1,500 proteins detected by 97 patient sera
(Figure 1B).

 In sum, 81 different patients collectively displayed strong reac-
tivities to >40% of human proteins arrayed. For most proteins
(blue dots 13–3731, Figure 1D), reactivities were spread across
the cohort, reflecting high inter-patient variation, whereas �12
proteins (blue dots 1–12, Figure 1D), including several type I
IFNs, were recognized by > 60% of patients, as reported
(Meager et al., 2006). However, the ‘‘public specificities’’ were
not enriched among the 126 reactivities shared between patients
and controls at z > 3 (red dots, Figure 1D), emphasizing that their
common autoantigenicity is unique to the patients. Patient autor-
eactivity frequencies were largely comparable across geograph-
ical locations, albeit somewhat less in Norway and Slovenia, and
age ranges (Figures S1B and S1C). Indeed, most anti-IFN auto-
antibodies of APECED patients were reported to increase early in
life and remain stable thereafter (Meager et al., 2006; Wolff et al.,
2013).
The collective targets of patient antibodies included intracel-
lular, trans-membrane, and secreted proteins. Because many
proteins displayed on the ProtoArray may be denatured, there
may be false-negatives that underestimate patient reactivities
to conformational determinants. Although a detailed analysis of
the types of proteins targeted will be presented, it is evident
that the proteins most commonly detected by patient sera
included numerous cytokines, particularly type I IFNs, for which
reason this study focuses on the nature of those autoreactivities.
Strong, Selective Anti-Cytokine Reactivities
Human type I IFN genes include 13 IFNa genes, 1 IFNb gene, and
1 IFNu gene. There is also a type II IFNg gene and three type III
IFNl genes. IFNg is largely limited to lymphocytes, whereas
type I and type III IFNs are broadly expressed, with their func-
tional uniqueness and/or redundancy unresolved (Ivashkiv and
Donlin, 2014). As assessed by ProtoArray, patient sera showed
significantly stronger reactivities than controls toward all IFNa
subtypes, albeit the reactivities to some (e.g., a1/13, a5, and
a14) were higher than those to others (e.g., a2, a16, and a21)
(Figure 2A). The differential between patients versus controls
was
emphasized
by
luciferase-based
immunoprecipitation
(LIPS) in which many target proteins were recognized in their
native conformations (Figure 2B). Many patients showed strong
reactivities to IFNu but rarely toward IFNb (Figure 2B) and never
toward IFNk and IFNε, two phylogenetically distant type I IFNs
(data not shown). By contrast, patient sera harbored reactivities
significantly above controls toward IL1a, IL5, IL6, IL17A, IL17F,
IL20, IL22, IL28A (IFNl2), IL28B (IFNl3), and IL29 (IFNl1) (Fig-
ure 2C). Whereas reactivities toward some targets (e.g., IL17F,
IL22) were common to most patients, reactivities toward others
(e.g., IL20, IL28, IL6) were not (Table S1), and with the exception
of IL5, patient sera mostly did not detect either Th2 cytokines
(e.g., IL4 and IL13) or IL21, a Tfh (T follicular helper) cell cytokine
that drives high-affinity antibody maturation. There were also no
reactivities toward G-CSF and GM-CSF (Table S1), which drive
the development of myeloid cells associated with the patients’
inflammatory endocrinopathies.
Cytokine reactivities were largely validated by ELISA, which
confirmed that IFNg was only rarely and weakly recognized by
patient sera (Figure 2D; Table S1) and that there was no reactivity
toward TNFa (data not shown). By contrast, ELISA revealed au-
toantibodies toward IL32a and IL32g, two poorly characterized
proinflammatory cytokines (Figure 2D; Table S1). In sum, 81
APS1/APECED patient sera collectively displayed strong reac-
tivities to a very selective subset of human cytokines.
Very High-Affinity Human Antibodies
To understand the nature of patient serum reactivities, nine
IFNa-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were derived by
limit-dilution cloning from memory B cells of four patients. Two
were characterized in detail (26B9 and 19D11), whereas a
more limited analysis of the others strongly argued that the prop-
erties of 26B9 and 19D11 were generally representative of
patients’ cytokine-specific antibodies. First, their VH and Vk
sequences were highly mutated relative to their germline
counterparts, with non-conservative replacements enriched
in complementarity-determining regions (CDRs), as expected
(white; Figure 3A). The antibodies bore no obvious resemblance
to each other in V-gene segment or CDR3 usage. Conversely, a
third anti-IFNa antibody, 50E11, shared with 19D11 the same VH
(IGHV1-69) and junctional (IGHJ4) segments and a very similar
light chain (IGKV3-11 versus V3-20) (Figure S2A). However, there
were very different template-independent nucleotide insertions
in the VH CDR3s of 19D11 and 50E11, and the somatic mutation
patterns were different: whereas 19D11 and 26B9 showed high
mutation frequencies in VH CDR2 and Vk CDR1, 50E11 did not
(Figures 3A and S2A).
The recombinant antibodies 26B9 and 19D11 harvested from
transfected CHO cells were immobilized on surface plasmon
resonance (SPR) chips over which were run recombinant human
IFNa2b, IFNa4, IFNa14, and IFNu, the latter being recognized by
26B9 but not by 19D11 (Figure 3B). These experiments revealed
very slow off-rates reflecting extremely high affinities of the anti-
bodies for their targets, ranging from KD = 3.28e�14M for 26B9
toward IFNa14 to KD = 2.09e�11M for 26B9 toward IFNa2b (Fig-
ures 3B and 3C). Sub-picomolar/near-femtomolar dissociation
constants were likewise shown by 19D11 (Figures 3B and 3C).
Thus, APS1/APECED patients harbor some of the strongest
affinity antibodies described.
18-mer peptides spanning IFNa2b and IFNu were used to
map linear epitopes recognized by 26B9 and 19D11. However,
no specific reactivities were detected (data not shown), consis-
tent with the antibodies binding conformational determinants
shared by several type I IFNs. Also, the antibodies reacted poorly
or not at all to mouse IFNs (Table S2).
To investigate the origins of the high-affinity, conformation-
specific antibodies, germline counterparts for 19D11, 26B9,
and 50E11, albeit with the same CDR3-VDJ sequences, were ex-
pressed and tested by LIPS against recombinant human IFNa2b,
IFNa8, and IFNa14. There was no measurable interaction with
any target (Figure 3D), although the antibodies’ quality was
evident from their comparable detection by anti-human IgG (Fig-
ure S2B). These data argue that the strong autoreactivity toward
IFNs developed de novo during affinity maturation, rather than
being an intrinsic property of the germline repertoire that is
enhanced by affinity maturation.
The high affinities of 26B9 and 19D11 were not unique. Thus, a
patient-derived IgGk mAb (20A10) specific for IL20 (which is
not a target detected by most patients; Figure 2C; Table S1)

 displayed a KD of 9.1e�14M, (Table S3). Likewise one IgGk mAb
(17E3) and one IgGl mAb (24D3), each specific for IL17F, dis-
played dissociation constants of <10 pM, and one IgGk antibody
(30G1) and one IgGl antibody (35G11) specific for IL22 dis-
played dissociation constants of 37 pM and 39 pM, respectively.
As a comparison, a CHO cell-expressed form of fezakinumab, a
humanized anti-IL22 mAb tested in the clinic, displayed a KD of
54 pM (Table S3). The only exception to this pattern was 2C2,
an IgGl mAb specific for IL32g (for which no human antibody
has been reported), which displayed nanomolar dissociation
(Table S3).
Similar to IFNa antibodies, most cytokine-specific antibodies
did not detect linear peptides from relevant target proteins,
strongly suggestive of complex conformational determinants
(data not shown). The one exception was 20A10, which bound
to an IL20 peptide and within which key amino acids were iden-
tified by mutagenesis (Figures S2C and S2D).
The antibody sequences of IL17F-reactive 17E3 and 9A2 and
of IL22-reactive 30G1 and 35G11 displayed myriad non-conser-
vative mutations enriched in the CDRs. Again their germline
counterparts did not detect the respective targets (Figures 3D,
S2E, and S2F). Moreover, neither patient-derived antibodies
nor their germline counterparts showed any general autoreactiv-
ity (judged by immunofluorescent staining of tissue sections or
HEp-2 cells) or reactivity to Candida albicans, thus arguing
against candida infection being the trigger for autoantibody gen-
eration (data not shown).
The highly mutated CDRs of all studied antibodies suggested
that they derived from GC reactions that partially rely on Tfh cells.
Aberrant generation and/or activation of Tfh cells has been
described in several autoimmune diseases (Ueno et al., 2015),
but when four pediatric and four adult APS1/APECED were
compared to controls, we found no differences in the percent-
ages of circulating CXCR5+ Tfh cells, or their activation state,
as judged by ICOS (inducible costimulator) and CCR7 levels
(Figure S3).
Biologically Active Human Antibodies
To test the biological activities of 19D11 and 26B9, HEK293 cells
transfected with type I IFN-stimulated response elements (ISRE)
fused to firefly luciferase were treated with recombinant forms
of each of 12 IFNa subtypes and IFNu in the presence or
absence of increasing concentrations of 19D11 or 26B9.
Following treatment, firefly luciferase values were normalized
to those of co-transfected Renilla luciferase, so as to control
for variations in transfection efficiency. Both antibodies strongly
inhibited the IFN-dependent response, with median IC50 values
of 2.83 ng/ml for 26B9 and 0.9 ng/ml for 19D11 (Figure 4A; Table
S4). By comparison, median IC50 values of 76.24 ng/ml and
10.86 ng/ml, respectively, were displayed by in-house-gener-
ated recombinant sifalimumab and rontalizumab, two anti-IFN
mAbs used in clinical trials for systemic lupus erythematosus pa-
tients (Table S4).
Predictably, the antibodies varied in their inhibition of IFN-
stimulated responses. Thus, 26B9 neutralized IFNu, but not
IFNa16, and only poorly inhibited IFNa8 (Figure 4A; Table S4).
Likewise, in the same assay, rontalizumab failed to efficiently
neutralize IFNa6, IFNa7 and IFNa10, whereas sifalimumab
neutralized several IFNa subtypes only weakly. By contrast,
19D11 neutralized all 12 IFNa subtypes tested (Table S4).
Patient-derived IFN-specific mAbs were also assessed for
their capacity to inhibit STAT1 phosphorylation in cells treated
with each of 12 IFNa subtypes, IFNu, IFNb, or IFNg (Figures
4B, 4C, and 4D). As predicted from the luciferase assay,
19D11 inhibited STAT1 phosphorylation levels (normalized to
total STAT1 or tubulin) driven by all IFNa subtypes but did not
affect responses to IFNu, IFNb, or IFNg. By contrast, 25C3, an
additional patient-derived mAb (Table S2), was highly selective
for discrete IFNa subtypes, whereas other antibodies tested,
including 26B9, showed neutralization profiles between those
of 19D11 and 25C3 (Figures 4B–4D). Only 26B9 and 31B4
neutralized IFNu, and none neutralized IFNb or IFNg. By com-
parison, sifalimumab, rontalizumab, and AGS-009 (another
IFNa-targeting mAb in clinical development) showed variable
and less uniform inhibition of STAT1 phosphorylation induced
by different IFNa subtypes (Figure S4A).
The striking biological activities of patient mAbs were not
limited to those specific for IFNs in that potent functional target
neutralization was shown by mAbs targeting IL17F, IL22,
IL32g, and IL20, respectively (Figure S4B).
Biologically Active Human Antibodies In Vivo
We next asked whether patient autoantibodies could functionally
neutralize targets in vivo. To test this, mice were treated intraper-
itoneally (i.p.) with a single aliquot of antibodies 26B9, 19D11, or
sifalimumab, and their ears inoculated intradermally (i.d.) on
days 1, 3, 6, and 8 with recombinant human IFNa5 or IFNa14
(Figure 5A) and IFNu (data not shown). Relative to repeated inoc-
ulation with vehicle/PBS, the cytokines induced ear swelling, re-
flecting an inflammatory response that includes rapid TNFa and
IFNg induction (Figures S5A and S5B). This ear swelling was
significantly inhibited by single injections of antibodies (Fig-
ure 5B). Again, neutralization varied toward the effector IFNa
subtype: 26B9 and 19D11, but not sifalimumab, largely ablated
the IFNa5 response, whereas all three partially yet significantly
limited swelling induced by IFNa14 (Figure 5B).
Specific, antibody-mediated neutralization in vivo was like-
wise seen when the same assay was applied to human IL17F

and 30G1), and IL20 (20A10 and 2A11). Binding to immobilized IL17F (17E3 and 9A2) was determined by ELISA.

 or IL32g (Figures 6A and 6B). For IL17 neutralization, the data are
clearly consistent with the known capacity of APS1/APECED
patients’ antibodies to neutralize Th17-family cytokines (Kisand
et al., 2010; Puel et al., 2010), thereby predisposing to Candida
infection.
Additionally, the detection of mouse IL22 by antibody 30G1
offered an opportunity to measure its bio-activity toward endog-
enous IL22, a primary effector of imiquimod (IMQ)-induced
dermatitis used to model psoriasis (van der Fits et al., 2009).
IMQ-induced pathology measured by modified PASI scoring
was significantly ameliorated by 30G1 relative to IgG control,
particularly following an initial inflammatory response (Figures
6C and S6). Again, 30G1 was at least as effective as an in-
house-expressed anti-IL22 antibody, fezakinumab (see above)
(Figure 6C). Collectively these data establish the capacity of
patient anti-cytokine antibodies to limit pathologies induced by
their targets in vivo.

Clinical Correlates of Neutralizing
Antibodies
Given the results from animal models, it
was appropriate to consider the potential
impact of APS1/APECED antibodies in
the patients themselves. Because circu-
lating IFNa levels are extremely low in
human peripheral blood, even following
vaccination (Sobolev et al., 2016), circu-
lating IFN levels do not offer robust bio-
markers of anti-IFNa antibodies. Neither
does measurement of interferon-stimu-
lated genes (ISGs) because many, e.g.,
CXCL10, can be upregulated by type II
IFNs (Welcher et al., 2015). By contrast,
antibody activities may be reliably reflected
in discrete pathologies, as in the correla-
tion of anti-IL22 with candidiasis.
In this regard, many datasets, particu-
larly in mouse models, suggest that type I
IFN contributes to type 1 diabetes (T1D)
(Carrero et al., 2013; Downes et al., 2010;
Foulis et al., 1987; Huang et al., 1995; Li
et
al.,
2008). Although
APECED/APS1
patients by definition suffer from polyen-
docrinopathy, T1D affects only �10%–
20% of patients and manifests primarily
in
adulthood
(Husebye
et
al.,
2009;
Kisand and Peterson, 2015). This is despite the fact that
radioimmunoassays have revealed that many APS1/APECED
patients
carry
GAD65-reactive
autoantibodies,
a
clinically
applied biomarker for likely onset of T1D (Ziegler et al., 2013).
Consistent with this, ProtoArray and LIPS data showed that
many patients carried GAD65- and/or GAD67-reactive anti-
bodies, but among them relatively few presented with T1D (red
dots, Figures 7A and 7B). Collectively, these many observations
suggest that patients at risk of T1D, as judged by anti-GAD65/
GAD67, might fail to develop T1D if they harbored powerfully
neutralizing anti-IFNa antibodies. Indeed, we reported a seem-
ingly exceptional APS1/APECED patient, completely lacking
IFNa-neutralizing antibodies and presenting with T1D (Kisand
et al., 2008).
To investigate this, the 8 patients presenting with T1D
(red dots, Figure 7B; mean age ± SD, 48 ± 11 years) were
compared with an available cohort of 13 patients without

589
 T1D but with strong GAD65 reactivity (relative luciferase
units > 5) (blue dots, Figure 7B; mean age ± SD, 31 ± 12
years). Consistent with T1D developing in adult APS1/APECED
patients, GAD65 reactivities mostly arose post-adolescence,
and hence the patient cohorts comprised 20 adults and one
8 year old.
As expected, all 21 patients harbored antibodies to IFNa
and IFNu (see Figure 2B), but when tested for IFNa and IFNu
neutralization, the antibodies showed a striking segregation
with clinical status (Figures 7C, 7D, and S7A): patients without
T1D collectively neutralized all IFNa subtypes, whereas those
with T1D showed only low or negligible neutralization. Particu-
larly strong differences were seen vis-a-vis IFNa1, IFNa2,
IFNa5, IFNa8, IFNa14, and IFNa17 neutralization (Figure 7C).
The two subgroups of the 21 patients also showed statistically
significant differences in neutralizing IFNu, but the difference
was weaker than for IFNa (Figure S7A). Interestingly, the two
GAD65-reactive non-diabetics who displayed relatively low
IFNa neutralization were young adults who may be en route to
developing T1D.
In a small subcohort of GAD65/67-reactive patients for whom
longitudinal samples were available, the three T1D patients
(red bars) again showed lower IFNa neutralization relative to
the two patients without T1D. Moreover, one patient was able
to neutralize IFNa4 in 1978 but by 2012 could no longer do so
and presented with T1D (Figure S7B).
Such striking correlations with T1D (Figure 7D) were not
evident for any other naturally arising anti-cytokine antibodies,
supporting the view that IFNa may contribute critically to the nat-
ural progression of T1D. Moreover, although the data do not
prove that active anti-IFN antibodies underpin selective protec-
tion from T1D, they provide a firm foundation for exploring the
potentials of APS1/APECED-derived autoantibodies to amelio-
rate other major diseases that are rarely if ever present in
APS1/APECED patients.

DISCUSSION
This analysis of the impact of AIRE defi-
ciency on human B cells has revealed
a signature pattern of humoral autoreac-
tivity with general implications for our
understanding of autoimmunity. First,
the autoantibodies studied were mostly
extremely high affinity and specific for
native conformational epitopes. These
properties were shared by antibodies
specific for cytokines targeted by most patients (e.g., IFNa,
IL17, IL22) and by antibodies specific for IL20 to which few
patients displayed reactivity. Because such properties are
very rare among antibodies raised by immunization, when B
cells are primed de novo to antigen for short periods of time,
it seems inappropriate to continue to model one type of mAb
on the other.
Second, essentially all 81 APS1/APECED patients studied
showed strong reactivities toward a common set of 10–15 pro-
teins, coupled with patient-specific reactivity profiles toward
80–90 additional proteins. This limited frequency (< 1% of pro-
teins displayed on the array) is consistent with a recent report
that B cell tolerance was not globally disrupted in 51 APS1/
APECED patients sampled (Landegren et al., 2016). Nonethe-
less, the patient-to-patient variation in reactivity profiles meant
that the 97 sera analyzed in our study collectively harbored anti-
bodies toward over 3,500 proteins.
The patient-to-patient variation argues that B cell autoimmu-
nity resulting from AIRE deficiency is not simply an amplification
of sporadic, low-level autoreactivities seen in healthy controls
but has distinct origins. By this perspective, defects in central
T cell tolerance may underpin other autoimmune and autoinflam-
matory pathologies attributed to high-affinity autoantibodies.
Whereas this contrasts with the widely held view that autoim-
mune diseases mostly reflect peripheral tolerance defects, it
aligns with data that central tolerance defects contribute to the
NOD mouse model of T1D (Geng et al., 1998; Zucchelli et al.,
2005). Moreover, wherever autoantibodies reflect central T cell
tolerance defects, donor-to-donor variation is to be expected,
as individuals will generate distinct TCR repertoires via quasi-
random gene rearrangements, will be exposed to different phys-
iologic and environmental triggers that promote the selective
outgrowth of autoreactive T cell clones, and will differ in immune
response modifier genes (e.g., HLA) that regulate the magnitude
of antigen-specific responses.

Cell 166, 582–595, July 28, 2016
 Autoantibodies to some non-tissue-restricted antigens, in-
cluding multiple type I IFNa subtypes, are displayed by almost
all patients, sometimes early post-partum (Wolff et al., 2013).
Most likely, the immunogenicity of these proteins arises by
mechanisms distinct from those shaping patient-specific auto-
antibody repertoires. Possibly the public autoantibodies arise
from a direct impact of AIRE deficiency on B cell tolerance,
for example, via the dysregulation of AIRE-expressing thymic
B cells that resemble GC B cells by several criteria (Yamano
et al., 2015). Arguing against this, however, autoantibodies to
type I IFNs, Th17 cytokines, and additional self-proteins are
found in thymoma patients with AIRE-sufficient B cells (Kisand
et al., 2011; Meager et al., 1997; Wolff et al., 2014). This likewise
argues against autoantibodies to type I IFNs and Th17 cytokines
originating from defects in lymph node AIRE+ cells termed
eTACs (Gardner et al., 2008). Although studies in mice have
suggested tolerizing roles of eTACs, the functions of their rare
human counterparts are unknown (Poliani et al., 2010).
AIRE deficiency may, however, act indirectly on thymic B cells,
for example by hyperactivity of functionally competent thymic gd
cells (Ribot et al., 2009) that may likewise be dysregulated in thy-
moma. Such cells may create an intra-thymic milieu favoring
priming rather than tolerance of thymic B cells toward proteins
highly expressed in the thymus (Dudakov et al., 2012; Meager
et al., 2006).
Notwithstanding this possibility, our findings suggest that
high-affinity autoantibodies in APS1/APECED patients prob-

antigens
(Brink,
2014;
Hargreaves et al., 2013), and activated
peripheral blood Tfh cells correlate posi-
tively with serum autoantibodies and disease activity/severity in
multiple autoimmune diseases (Ueno et al., 2015). Although our
analysis of four adult and four pediatric APS1/APECED patients
revealed no alterations in Tfh cell numbers relative to age-
matched healthy controls, this did not exclude Tfh cells being
enriched in autoreactive specificities. Moreover, no patients dis-
played neutralizing autoantibodies to IL21, a major mediator of
Tfh cells in the GC.
This etiology of APS1/APECED B cell autoimmunity is strik-
ingly similar to proposed origins of highly mutated anti-desmo-
glein-3 antibodies in autoimmune pemphigus (Di Zenzo et al.,
2012) and of anti-GM-CSF antibodies pathognomonic in pul-
monary alveolar proteinosis (Piccoli et al., 2015). In those
studies, as in this, the closest germline counterparts (‘‘unmu-
tated common ancestors’’ [UCAs]) showed no reactivity toward
the targets of the affinity-matured autoantibodies. By contrast,
germline versions of antiviral antibodies showed only slightly
reduced binding to target viral antigens (Corti et al., 2011,
2013). Moreover, it is not the case that UCAs intrinsically lack
autoreactivity, as germline counterparts of some autoanti-
bodies with few replacement mutations showed autoantigen
reactivity in pemphigus patients (Cho et al., 2014). The underly-
ing defect(s) in T cell tolerance that dysregulate affinity matura-
tion in pemphigus, pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, and other
organ-specific autoimmune diseases may be limited to few
antigens, by contrast to broad-spectrum defects in APS1/
APECED.
Cell 166, 582–595, July 28, 2016
591
 That almost all APS1/APECED-derived mAbs were biologi-
cally active in vivo against a range of cytokine targets has
profound implications for patients. Clearly, immune-effector re-
sponses may be reduced, as in the association of anti-IL22
with susceptibility to Candidiasis (Kisand et al., 2010). Likewise,
gut barrier integrity may be compromised, leading to increased
levels of anti-commensal antibodies (Hetema
¨ ki et al., 2016).
Conversely, despite the common neutralization of IFNa and
IFNu, APS1/APECED patients do not show severe viral infec-
tions, as were recently reported for a child genetically impaired
in type I IFN (Ciancanelli et al., 2015). Possibly preserved
IFNb function mediates anti-viral protection in APS1/APECED
patients.
On the other hand, some autoantibodies may target key
mediators of immunopathologies, thereby ameliorating disease.
Thus, a unique correlation was observed between antibody-
mediated neutralization of IFNa and failure to develop T1D,
providing a novel strand of support for animal studies arguing
that targeting type I IFNs could be effective in T1D. The concept
that naturally arising autoantibodies may be beneficial is not
widely considered, despite its underpinning the widespread

use of therapeutic mAbs. In this regard,
it is striking that despite their severe flaws
in central T cell tolerance, APS1/APECED
patients do not present with systemic
sclerosis, Sjo
¨ gren’s syndrome, MS, or
SLE. These pathologies are considered
to involve interplays of IL17/Th17 and
type I IFNs—two main targets of APS1/
APECED autoantibodies (Ambrosi et al.,
2012). Likewise, Th17-driven psoriasis
was diagnosed in only two of our patients,
each of whom lacked autoantibodies
to IL17A, IL17F, and IL22 (our unpub-
lished data). Furthermore, atopy/allergy
is seemingly rare among APS1/APECED
patients, although whether anti-IL5 anti-
bodies underpin this requires more study.
For now, the data presented by this study strongly suggest that
antibodies recovered from APS1/APECED patients include ones
with profound therapeutic and diagnostic potential.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
More details are available in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Human Samples
Eighty-one APS1/APECED patients were diagnosed by mutational analysis of
AIRE and by autoantibodies to type I IFNs. All provided informed consent, and
many were analyzed previously (Kisand et al., 2011; Kluger et al., 2015; Meloni
et al., 2012; Wolff et al., 2007). Approvals by local ethics committees are
described in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures. Ages at serum sam-
pling were 4–73 years; mean = 31.9. For protoarray there were 12 age-
matched controls and 9 healthy first-degree relatives, and there were
additional healthy controls for LIPS and ELISA.
Immune Response Profiling by ProtoArray
Sera of patients, healthy relatives, and controls were tested against > 9,000 hu-
man proteins displayed on the Human Protein Microarray v5.1 (ThermoFisher
Scientific). Preprocessing methods were applied to account for technical vari-
ability. First, corresponding local background intensity was subtracted,
592
Cell 166, 582–595, July 28, 2016
 whereafter values were log-transformed and subjected to robust linear normal-
ization (Sboner et al., 2009). Z scores were calculated as the number of stan-
dard deviations of the signal from the mean of the corresponding controls
and healthy relatives; Z R 3 was considered positive. After scoring, stringent
quality assessment was undertaken, including high correlation coefficients of
duplicate spots of printed proteins (average r = 0.92), reactivity toward known
autoantibody targets, and perfect correlation of signals for proteins spotted in
different locations. Printing contaminants were identified as proteins showing
high correlation coefficients with known APECED antibody targets and were
further verified by cross-reference to another protoarray (5.0) used for 23 pa-
tients and 7 controls. Thus, 31 suspect false-positives were identified and
excluded from further consideration.
Antibody Isolation and Cloning
Cloning, production, and purification of human mAbs were performed as
described (patent application WO2013/098419). In brief, memory B cells
(CD22+, IgD�, IgM�, CD3�, CD8�, and CD54�) were flow-sorted (MoFlo)
from patient PBMC, incubated transiently with EBV-containing B95-8 super-
natant (SN) for 3.5 hr at 37�C, and then incubated in Transferrin- and CpG-
supplemented IMDM at 37�C, 5% CO2, at 10 cells/well in 96-well plates
coated with irradiated PBMC feeders. Short-term, oligoclonal B cell culture
SN were analyzed for IgG and antigen-specific antibodies detected by
ELISA and/or LIPS. Positive wells were harvested, cells single-cell-sorted
into reverse transcriptase (RT) buffer (Life Technologies), and RT-PCR
performed using Superscript III (Life Technologies) and random hexamers.
IgG VH, Vl, and Vk regions were amplified from cDNA by two-step nested
PCR reaction using Advantage 2 cDNA polymerase (Clontech) and primer
mixes specific for germline families (VBASE database). Nested primers
attached restriction sites for V-region cloning into expression vectors
providing IgG1, Ig-k, or Ig-l constant regions. Recombinant antibodies were
produced in HEK293T cells and antigen specificity analyzed by ELISA. Corre-
sponding closest germline region sequences were identified using the
VBASE2 database (Retter et al., 2005). CDRs were identified by IMGT defini-
tions (Lefranc, 2003).
Complete Ig-VH and VL regions described in US7741449 (Sifalimumab),
US7087726 B2 (Rontalizumab), US8361463 (ACO-1), and US20070258982
A1 (Fezakinumab) were ordered as CHO-codon-optimized synthetic con-
structs (GenScript) and expressed as above.
mAb Characterization In Vitro
EC50 binding of mAbs was determined by ELISA. Neutralizing capacities of
type I IFN-specific mAbs were studied using phospho-STAT1 quantification
in immunoblot and ISRE-luciferase reporter assay. IL17F, IL22, IL20, and
IL32 neutralization assays were performed on respective responsive cell lines.
mAB affinities were measured with a Biacore T200 (GE Healthcare). Epitope
mapping used overlapping 18-mer peptides.
mAb Characterization In Vivo
C57BL/6J (WT; from Charles River) mice were administered i.p. with mAbs
(day 0) and inoculated i.d. on days 1, 3, 6, and 8 with cognate human cytokines,
IFNa2a, IFNa2b, IFNa4, IFNa14, IL17F, and IL32g, and their ear thicknesses
measured with a micrometer. For IL22 mAbs cross-reactive to mouse, bioac-
tivity was assessed in imiquimod-treated mice.
