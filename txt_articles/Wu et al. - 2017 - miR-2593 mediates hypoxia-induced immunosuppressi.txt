 Abstract
The mechanisms by which hypoxic tumors evade immunological pressure and anti-tumor 
immunity remain elusive. Here, we report that two hypoxia-responsive microRNAs, miR25 and 
miR93, are important for establishing an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment by down-
regulating expression of the DNA-sensor cGAS. Mechanistically, miR25/93 targets NCOA3, an 
epigenetic factor that maintains basal levels of cGAS expression, leading to repression of cGAS 
upon hypoxia. This allows hypoxic tumor cells to escape immunological responses induced by 
damage-associated molecular pattern molecules (DAMPs), specifically the release of mtDNA. 
Moreover, restoring cGAS expression results in an anti-tumor immune response. Clinically, 
decreased levels of cGAS are associated with poor prognosis for patients with breast cancer 
harboring high levels of miR25/93. Together, these data suggest that inactivation of the cGAS 
pathway plays a critical role in tumor progression, and reveals a direct link between hypoxia-
responsive miRNAs and adaptive immune responses to the hypoxic tumor microenvironment, thus 
unveiling potential new therapeutic strategies.
Introduction
The ability of cancer cells to evade immune responses is critical for the emergence of 
malignant phenotypes1. Cancer cells can escape both innate and adaptive immune responses 
by deregulating immune effector cells and immunosuppressive cells, as well as molecules 
responsible for cancer cell recognition and elimination2. Hypoxia contributes to 
immunosuppression within tumors, helping shield cancer cells from immune attack and 
inhibiting immune killing functions3–5. For example, immunosuppressive cells (e.g., 
regulatory T cells) accumulate within hypoxic regions of tumors where they promote tumor 
progression6–9 and activate immune tolerance mechanisms that enable cancer cells to evade 
host immunosurveillance. Despite recent advances, the molecular mechanisms underlying 
hypoxia-induced immune escape are not yet fully understood.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate a variety of cellular processes, including immune cell 
differentiation, immune responses to infection, and the development of immune 
disorders10–11. In the context of tumorigenesis, dysregulated miRNAs promote tumor 
progression by regulating cancer pathways associated with tumor malignancy12. A recent 
screen for hypoxia-regulated miRNAs in breast cancer cells revealed that hypoxia modulates 
miRNA function during breast cancer progression13. Hypoxia-responsive miRNAs regulate 
a complex spectrum of candidate target genes, including those involved in proliferation, 
apoptosis, metabolism, and migration14. Here we identify hypoxia-responsive miR25 and 
miR93 as critical factors in suppressing the expression of cGAS through a pathway that 
requires TET1 and NCOA3. In this way, these miRNAs promote immune escape of hypoxic 
tumors from DAMP-induced immunological stress, ultimately leading to the formation of an 
immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment.

Hypoxia signaling induces immunosuppressive phenotypes
Recent findings suggest that hypoxia/HIF-1 signaling suppresses host defense against 
cancer9,15. To prove this concept, we examined associations between hypoxic tumors and 
immunosuppression. We identified hypoxic breast tumor samples based on levels of HIF-1α 
and assessed the expression of an array of inflammatory and immune mediators. This 
analysis revealed decreased levels of Ifn-γ, an anti-tumor factor, as well as decreased levels 
of several factors known to drive anti-tumor immunity, such as Il-12, Cxcl10, Ifit1, and 
Tbx-2116. In contrast, Il-10, a tumor-promoting factor, as well as Il-1β and Il-17, were 
increased (Fig. 1a–c). As a second means of studying hypoxic cancer cells, we 
subcutaneously inoculated wild type mice with murine breast cancer cells (E0771) that 
overexpress a constitutively active form of HIF-1α17. Because hypoxia results in the 
recruitment of immunosuppressive cells4, we characterized tumor infiltrating immune cells 
(TICs). FACS analysis of tumor biopsies indicated an increase in CD11b+ Ly6G− Ly6Chigh 
monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in HIF-1α overexpressing tumors 
(compared to control tumors), whereas HIF-1α did not affect levels of CD11b+ F4/80+ 
tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) or CD11b+ Ly6G+ Ly6Clow granulocytic MDSCs 
(Fig. S1a–c). The population of effector CD8+ T cells was decreased in HIF-1α 
overexpressing tumors, accompanied by a change in the percentage of tumor infiltrating 
CD8+ T cells, whereas the percentage of CD4+ T cells remained the same (Fig. 1d; Fig. S1d 
and e). Furthermore, we found greater numbers of CD4+FoxP3+ Tregs in HIF-1α 
overexpressing tumors (Fig. 1e), consistent with previous reports showing enhanced 
recruitment of Tregs by hypoxia9,18. We also analyzed these tumors and consistently 
observed immunosuppressive gene expression profiles, as shown by decreased levels of anti-
tumor immunity factors and increased levels of tumor-promoting factors (Fig. 1f and g). 
Collectively, these results indicate that hypoxia/HIF-1αpromotes immunosuppression during 
breast cancer formation in vivo.
Hypoxia-responsive miR25/93 functions as an immunosuppressive factor
To identify bona fide hypoxia-regulated miRNAs, we performed small RNA sequencing 
using different cellular models, including hypoxic cells and HIF-1αoverexpressing cells, as 
described19 (Fig. S2a). Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) for selected miRNA candidates 
revealed correlations between these miRNAs and breast cancer formation, as well as 
oncogenic signaling pathways. (Fig. S2b and c). These data led us to focus on 
themiR-106b-25/miR-17-92 clusters, which are deregulated in human cancer20. It is well 
established that themiR-17-92 cluster plays roles in the development of the immune system 
and cancer; however, the role of themiR-106b-25 cluster remains largely unknown. We 
identified miR25 and miR93 as potential targets of hypoxia, as expression of these miRNAs 
was markedly increased in hypoxic conditions (Fig. 2a–c; Fig. S2d). However, hypoxia did 
not affect levels of miR106b, another member of the miR106b-25 cluster. shRNA-mediated 
knockdown of HIF-1αabolished the ability of hypoxia to induce miR25/93 expression (Fig. 
S2e), thereby indicating that miR25/93 are hypoxia-responsive miRNAs.

 Inhibiting miR25/93 slowed tumor growth in wild type mice. Importantly, this effect was 
compromised in immune-deficient mice, suggesting that miR25/93inhibitshost immune 
responses against the tumor(Fig. 2d and e). To explore the role of miR25/93 in hypoxia-
relevant tumor immune responses, we inhibited miR25/93 in tumors overexpressing HIF-1α. 
This compromised the ability of HIF-1α to: 1) enhance tumor growth (Fig. 2f), 2) decrease 
levels of effector CD8+ T cells, and 3) increase recruitment of Tregs (Fig. 2g and h). 
Furthermore, we analyzed the profile of TICs in tumors constitutively 
overexpressingmiR25/93. Monocytic MDSCs consistently accumulated in miR25/93 
overexpressing tumors; this was accompanied by an increased rate of tumor growth (Fig. 2i; 
Fig. S3a and b). In contrast, miR25/93 overexpression did not affect TAMs or granulocytic 
MDSCs (Fig. S3c and d). Overexpression of miR25/93 decreased the population of effector 
CD8+ T cells, alongside changes in the percentage of tumor infiltrating CD4+ T cells and 
CD8+ T cells (Fig. 2j; Fig. S3 e and f). Similar to hypoxic tumors, miR25/93 overexpression 
resulted in a greater number of Tregs (Fig. 2k). Gene expression analysis ofmiR25/93-
overexpressing tumors consistently indicated an immune regulatory gene signature 
associated with hypoxia (Fig. S3g and h). Together, these results indicate that elevated levels 
of miR25/93 in tumor cells drive the establishment of an immunosuppressive environment.
TET1 is important for the up-regulation of miR25/93 in response to hypoxia
To investigate the molecular mechanism underlying hypoxia-induced miR25/93 expression, 
we first examined the role of HIF-1α.HIF-1α expression was required for hypoxia to induce 
the expression ofmiR25/93 (Fig. S2e). However, we did not observe significant HIF-1α 
binding to the miR25/93 genomic region, as compared to the VEGF promoter, which 
HIF-1α bound tightly upon hypoxia (Fig. S4a). This suggests that hypoxia regulates 
miR25/93 in a HIF-1α-independent manner. It is known that hypoxia can regulate miRNA 
biogenesis via epigenetic mechanisms21. Recent findings indicate that TET-mediated local 
5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) changes are important for the regulation of hypoxia-
responsive genes19,22. Thus, we examined the role of 5hmC and TET proteins in this 
context. hMeDIP-seq analysis as well as conventional hMeDIP-qPCR analysis showed an 
increase in 5hmC levels within the miR25/93 genomic loci in hypoxic cells (Fig. S4b and c). 
ChIP-qPCR analysis for TET1 and TET3 indicated increased binding of TET1, but not 
TET3, to these regions (Fig. S4d). In support of these findings, silencing TET1, but not 
TET3, prevented hypoxia-induced upregulation of miR25/93 expression (Fig. S4e–h). 
Furthermore, the expression of wild type TET1, but not an inactive form of TET1, restored 
hypoxic epigenetic phenotype (Fig. S4i). Together, these results indicate an epigenetic layer 
of regulation in determining miR25/93 levels in hypoxic conditions.
A hypoxia-TET1-miR25/93 signaling axis represses cGAS-dependent immunity
Next, we sought to identify the downstream signaling pathways that contribute to miR25/93-
driven immunosuppression. RNA-seq analysis in breast cancer cells overexpressing 
miR25/93 was conducted to identify miRNA-responsive genes (Fig. 3a). Gene ontology 
analysis of these downstream genes highlighted biological processes related to transcription 
factor activity, cell adhesion, etc. (Fig. 3b). Validation of these potential target genes by 
qPCR indicated that cyclic-GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), which is critical for the innate 
immune system to detect cytosolic DNA23–24, was a promising downstream target for

 miR25/93. Decreased levels of cGAS were detected in breast cancer cells overexpressing 
miR25/93orin hypoxic conditions (Fig. 3c–f). In line with this, shRNA-mediated inhibition 
ofmiR25/93restored cGAS expression in hypoxic cancer cells (Fig. 3g and h). Because 
TET1 regulates miR25/93 expression in hypoxia, we examined the expression of cGAS in 
TET1-deficient breast cancer cells. As expected, loss of TET1 inhibited hypoxia-induced 
down-regulation of cGAS expression (Fig. 3i and j). Furthermore, in tumors 
overexpressingHIF-1α or miR25/93, cGAS levels were consistently down-regulated (Fig. 3k 
and l). Collectively, these results indicate a role for the hypoxia-TET1-miR25/93 signaling 
axis in regulating cGAS.
cGAS serves as a sensor for cytosolic DNA, inducing the production of type I interferons, 
which lead to innate immunity24. Hence, we investigated whether hypoxia attenuates the 
innate immune response against cytosolic DNA. We used qPCR analysis to assess levels of 
IFN-β expression, an indicator of cGAS-mediated immune response24. Hypoxia treatment 
inhibited the induction of IFN-β in breast cancer cells (Fig. 4a). Given that the TET1-
miR25/93 signaling pathway is required to repress cGAS expression in response to hypoxia, 
this pathway may also be important for hypoxia-induced repression of innate immunity 
responses to cytosolic DNA. Indeed, we observed the restoration of hypoxia-induced 
immune responses in TET1-deficient cells (Fig. 4b and c). Likewise, inhibition of miR25/93 
in hypoxic cells restored the induction of IFN-β in the presence of cytosolic DNA (Fig. 4d 
and e). In support of these observations, we demonstrated that down-regulation of cGAS 
both decreased the innate immune response to cytosolic DNA and enhanced hypoxia-
induced immunosuppression (Fig. 4f and g). Furthermore, the cytosolic DNA-induced 
immune response was significantly reduced by knocking down cGAS expression in either 
MCF7 or MDA-MB-231 cells undergoing miR25/93 inactivation (Fig. 4h and i). Together, 
these results suggest that repression of cGAS by the TET1-miR25/93 pathway is crucial for 
hypoxia to suppress the immune response to cytosolic DNA.
Levels of endogenous DNA, considered damage-associated molecular pattern molecules 
(DAMPs), are increased by hypoxia during cancer progression and can trigger the rejection 
of tumors by the immune system25–26. Recent studies have demonstrated that the cGAS-
dependent DNA sensing pathway can also recognize mtDNA released by apoptosis27–28. In 
line with this, hypoxia induces mitophagy and the extensive fragmentation of 
mitochondria26,29–30, which may lead to the release of mtDNA into the cytoplasm. We 
therefore hypothesized that to relieve immune pressure driven by the accumulation of 
cytosolic mtDNA, which occurs in the hypoxic tumor microenvironment during cancer 
progression, cancer cells must suppress the cGAS-dependent DNA sensing pathway via 
TET1 and miR25/93. Thus, we examined whether hypoxia leads to the accumulation of 
cytosolic mtDNA in cancer cells. qPCR analysis demonstrated increased levels of cytosolic 
mtDNA in hypoxic breast cancer cells compared to normoxic controls (Fig. S5a). Consistent 
with previous findings29, hypoxia treatment induced LC3-II and decreased levels of p62, 
markers of autophagy/mitophagy (Fig. S5b). To ensure that mtDNA activates the cGAS-
dependent immune response, we transfected mtDNA into breast cancer cells and analyzed 
IFN-β levels. The induction of IFN-β in this context indicated that cytosolic mtDNA serves 
as a trigger for innate immunity (Fig. S5c). Notably, repression of miRNA25/93 restored the 
induction of IFN-β by cytosolic mtDNA in hypoxic cells (Fig. S5d and e). Furthermore,

 down-regulation of cGAS attenuated mtDNA-induced immune response (Fig. S5f and g), 
confirming that cGAS acts as an important senor for cytosolic mtDNA. We reasoned that 
manipulating miR25/93 or cGAS levels may alter levels of cytosolic mtDNA, leading to 
compromised immunosuppression. Thus, we analyzed cytoplasmic levels of mtDNA and 
found similar levels of hypoxia-induced cytoplasmic mtDNA in either miRNA25/93-
inactivated or cGAS-deficient cells, compared to control cells (Fig. S6a and b). Together, 
these results reveal that the TET1-miR25/93 signaling pathway represses a cGAS-dependent 
immune response that results from hypoxia-mediated release of mtDNA.
To ensure that cGAS functions to dampen the immunosuppressive microenvironment, we 
constitutively expressed cGAS in miR25/93 overexpressing tumors. FACS analysis 
demonstrated that re-expression of cGAS reversed immunosuppressive phenotypes, as 
indicated by significantly decreased populations of monocytic MDSCs, along with an 
increase in effector CD8+ T cells (Fig. 5a and b). Likewise, Tregs were decreased in cGAS 
re-expressing tumors compared with miR25/93 overexpressing tumors (Fig. 5c). 
Furthermore, gene expression analysis indicated increased levels of antitumor immunity 
factors in cGAS re-expressing tumors, whereas levels of tumor promoting factors were 
significantly decreased (Fig. 5d and e). As a key effector of cGAS signaling, type I 
interferons (IFNs) mediate anti-tumor immunity via their immunostimulatory functions31. 
As the immunosuppressive function of miR25/93 may rely on restrained IFN-stimulated 
immunosurveillance, we examined levels of INF-β in vivo. We observed decreased levels of 
INF-β and cGAS in hypoxic tumors andHIF-1α overexpressing tumors (Fig. 5f). INF-β 
levels were restored in HIF-1α-overexpressing tumors in which miR25/93 were inhibited, as 
well as in miR25/93-overexpressing tumors in which cGAS was re-expressed (Fig. 5g). To 
ascertain the role of cGAS-IFN signaling in tumor development, we assessed tumor growth 
in mice lacking the interferon (alpha and beta) receptor 1 (IFNAR1). Forced expression of 
miR25/93 increased tumor cell proliferation in wild type mice; this effect was reversed by 
re-expressing cGAS (Fig. 5h). Loss of IFNAR1 compromised the ability of miR25/93 to 
promote tumor progression, supporting the notion that cGAS-IFN signaling inhibits tumor 
progression (Fig. 5i).
In addition, we found that tumors lacking cGAS were more proliferative than control 
tumors. (Fig. S7a). As expected, the analysis of TIC profiles in cGAS-deficient tumors 
revealed a pattern similar to miR25/93- or HIF-1-overexpressing tumors (Fig. S7b–d). 
Silencing cGAS decreased the percentage of effector CD8+ T cells; this is accompanied by 
changes in the levels of tumor infiltrating CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells (Fig. S7e–g). 
Likewise, FACS analysis indicated a significant increase in Tregs in cGAS-deficient tumors 
(Fig. S7h). Gene expression analysis further showed that down-regulation of cGAS 
recapitulated the immune gene signature that characterizes hypoxic tumors (Fig. S7i–k).
miR25/93 indirectly regulates cGAS expression by targeting NCOA3 upon hypoxia
Next, we sought to characterize the molecular mechanisms by which miR25/93 represses 
cGAS. Analysis of the 3′-UTR of the cGAS gene did not identify a putative miR25/93 target 
sequence, which led us to conclude that miR25/93 suppresses cGAS expression by targeting 
other regulators. In our search for additional factors that regulate cGAS, we noticed that the

 cGAS promoter region contains an AP-1 biding site. It is unlikely that AP-1 is a key factor 
in the hypoxia-mediated repression of cGAS, but our RNA-seq data indicated that NCOA3, 
a member of the nuclear receptor co-activator (Ncoa) family that coordinates with AP-132, 
was down-regulated in miR25/93 overexpressing cells (Fig. 6a). Likewise, hypoxia 
treatment resulted in decreased levels of NCOA3 (Fig. 6b). Analysis of the 3′-UTR 
associated with the NCOA3 transcript identified conserved target sequences for miR25/93. 
A 3′-UTR reporter assay showed that miR25/93 suppressed NCOA3 reporter activity. 
Mutating the miR25/93 target sequences within the NCOA3 3′-UTR abrogated miR25/93-
mediated repression (Fig. 6c). Together, these results indicate that NCOA3 is a downstream 
target of miR25/93.
Because NCOA3 functions as a lysine acetyltransferase involved in transcriptional 
activation33, we asked whether NCOA3 regulates cGAS expression in response to hypoxia. 
We found that ectopic expression of NCOA3 restored the expression of cGAS upon hypoxia 
(Fig. 6d). ChIP-qPCR analysis revealed decreased levels of NCOA3 binding to the cGAS 
promoter in hypoxic cancer cells, compared with normoxic controls. This was associated 
with decreased levels of CBP binding, a protein that interacts with NCOA3, as well as 
decreased binding of RNA polII to the cGAS transcription start site (Fig. 6e–g). Moreover, 
two epigenetic modifications indicative of active transcription, H3K27Ac and H3K4me2, are 
associated with NCOA3 function34 and were consistently downregulated in hypoxic cells 
(Fig. 6h–j). Re-expression of NCOA3 restored levels of CBP binding to cGAS genomic 
regions in hypoxic cancer cells (Fig. 7a,b, f, g). Likewise, levels of H3K27Ac and 
H3K4Me2 were restored by re-expression of NCOA3 (Fig. 7c–e, h–j). Collectively, these 
results indicate that repression of NCOA3 by miR25/93 is required for the suppression of 
cGAS in response to hypoxia.
The biological significance for miR25/93 and cGAS in clinical tissues
To test the relevance of these findings to human cancer, we first examined the prognostic 
impact of miR25/93. Levels of these miRNAs were correlated with poor prognosis for 
patients with different types of hypoxia-relevant tumors, such as brain, colon, and breast 
(Fig. 8a). Notably, higher levels of miR25 and miR93 were associated with reduced overall 
survival in patients with invasive breast carcinoma (Fig. 8b). We next examined the 
prognostic impact of cGAS levels for 148 patients with invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). 
Levels of cGAS were inversely associated with poor prognosis for these patients (Fig. 8c 
and d). Consistent with this result, lower levels of cGAS were correlated with poor survival 
for cancer patients harboring elevated levels of miR93 (Fig. 8e), whereas other identified 
miRNAs targets (e.g., Bim and PTEN) did not exhibit clinical significance (Fig. S8a and b), 
suggesting that the down-regulation of cGAS is a biologically relevant factor in miR25/93-
driven tumor progression. Collectively, these results support our hypothesis that repression 
of cGAS by hypoxia-responsive miR25/93 is critical for establishing an immunosuppressive 
environment that is associated with cancer progression.

 Discussion
The mechanisms by which tumor cells maintain immunological self-tolerance and hinder 
effective tumor immunity are critical for tumor progression. Here, we uncover a mechanism 
for hypoxia-induced escape from immunological stress caused by DAMPs (Fig. 8f). 
Hypoxia induced the expression of miR25/93 by increasing 5hmC levels (i.e., DNA 
demethylation) near the miR25/93 gene via the TET1 protein. Differential regulation of the 
miR-106b-25 cluster in response to hypoxia, as shown by our data and previous reports35–36, 
suggests coordination between epigenetic factors and HIF-mediated post-transcriptional 
machinery37 to differentially regulate miR25/93 levels. These data also reveal the 
complexity of the role played by 5hmC and TET in regulating cellular responses to hypoxia. 
This is also supported by our observations (Fig. S8c), as well as recent reports38–40, 
indicating an un-coupling of expression of the MCM7 gene (host gene for themiR-106b-25 
cluster) with the differential expression of members of themiR-106b-25 cluster. Recently, 
miR25/93 has emerged as an important onco-miRNA during tumorigenesis41, and here we 
further reveal its function in inducing immunosuppressive phenotypes. To promote immune 
avoidance, miR25/93 repressed cGAS by disrupting the epigenetic machinery that maintains 
basal levels of cGAS (this machinery includes NCOA3). Activation of the cGAS-dependent 
cytosolic DNA sensing pathway within tumor-resident immune cells results in antitumor 
immunity, which contributes to tumor regression42. We observed consistent repression of 
cGAS by hypoxia in different cell types, although miR25/93 is likely not essential for this 
effect in every case. Thus, we conclude that the repression of cGAS-IFN signaling in tumor 
cells is a critical event during cancer progression, indicating a critical role for hypoxia-
induced cell-intrinsic immune tolerance in the development of tumors. Interestingly, 
difference in tumor-infiltrating immune cells (e.g. CD4+ T cells and MDSCs) between 
different experimental settings (e.g. Fig. S1 and S3) suggest that hypoxia-responsive 
molecules regulate a diversity of immunosuppressive pathways. Thus, further analyses are 
required to understand the interplay between the tumor microenvironment and tumor 
immune responses.
Excessive DAMPs influence immunity and are associated with inflammatory responses, 
which contribute to many chronic diseases, including cancer 43. mtDNA represents one type 
of DAMP. During cancer progression, hypoxia induces the intracellular translocation and 
release of mtDNA26, which may contribute to immunological stress. We observed increased 
levels of cytoplasmic mtDNA in hypoxic cells, leading to the induction of an immune 
response. This immune response was inhibited by the hypoxia-TET1-miR25/93 signaling 
axis, suggesting a direct link between hypoxia-responsive miRNAs and immune tolerance to 
DAMP-induced immunological stress. In summary, our results highlight the link between 
cGAS down-regulation and tumor immunosuppression, and implicate miR25/93 as a central 
regulator that acts in concert with hypoxia to regulate immune escape from DAMPs-induced 
immunological pressure. These findings have potential implications for anti-cancer 
immunotherapies.

 Methods
Cells, plasmids, stable transfection, and oxygen deprivation
The E0771 murine breast cancer cell line was maintained in RPMI medium supplemented 
with 10% FBS and 1%penicillin/streptomycin. MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines were 
cultured in DMEM medium supplemented with10% FBS at 37°C in the presence of 5% 
CO2. A pcDNA3 mHIF-1α-MYC (P402A/P577A/N813A) (addgene) plasmid was used for 
generating HIF-1α overexpression clones in E0771 cells. A pBabe-NCOA3 expression 
vector was used for NCOA3 re-expression in human breast cancer cells. The plasmids for 
gene knockdown experiments were generated by inserting an oligonucleotide targeting a 
specific gene sequence into the pSUPER vector (oligoengine). These vectors were then used 
to establish stable tranfectants. For miRNA inhibition, MISSION LentimiRNA inhibitors 
(Sigma) targeting miR25 and miR93 were used to generate stable transfectants in MCF7 or 
MDA-MB-231 cells. For miRNA overexpression, the MDH1-PGK-GFP vector (addgene) 
was used to express human or mouse miR25/93 in human breast cancer cells or murine 
breast cancer cell, respectively. Oxygen deprivation was conducted in the hypoxic incubator 
with 1% O2, 5% CO2and 94% N2for 18 or 24 h.
Western blot analysis, RNA extraction, quantitative real-time PCR
Western blot was performed following standard protocols, as described19. Briefly, cells were 
harvested and lysed using RIPA buffer (50mMTris, 150mMNaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% 
Deoxycholate, 1% NP-40). Protein extracts were subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis. The 
membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk followed by antibody hybridization and the 
signals were visualized on X-ray film. For RNA extraction, total RNAs from cultured cells 
were extracted using the Trizol reagent (Invitrogen Life Technologies), and 1 μg of RNA 
was used for cDNA synthesis. Quantitative real-time PCR was carried out to quantify gene 
expression levels by using the CFX384 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System (BIO-RAD 
Laboratories, Inc.).
For measuring mtDNA in cytosol, as described44, the Mitochondria Isolation Kit (Thermo 
Fisher Scientific) was used to isolate cytosolic, mitochondrial, and nuclear fractions from 
cancer cells. Primers for human cytochrome B (and), human cytochrome C oxidase subunit 
III (and), human NADH dehydrogenase (and) were used in qPCR analysis. Cytoplamic 
mtDNA levels were normalized to nuclear DNA encoding 18S ribosomal RNA. The 
antibodies and primers used in the experiments are listed in supplementary table 3.
Luciferase reporter assays
Cells were seeded onto 6-well plates and transfected with the following: psiCheck2 
luciferase reporter plasmid containing wild type or mutated Ncoa3 3′-UTR and expression 
vector encoding human miR25/93. Transfected cells were exposed to 20% or 1% O2 for 24 
h. Luciferase activity in cell lysates was measured using Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay 
System (Promega).

 qPCR-ChIP and hMe-DIP
qPCR-ChIP assay was performed as described45. Briefly, crosslinked cell lysate was 
sonicated and subjected to an immunoprecipitation reaction with specific antibody 
conjugated beads. The immunoprecipitated DNA was purified through a phenol-chloroform 
DNA extraction protocol and then subjected to qPCR analysis. For the hMe-DIP assay, 
genomic DNA was prepared with the genomic DNA extraction kit (Promega) and sonicated 
into fragments of ~500bp. Fragmented DNA was denatured for 10 min at 95°C and 
immunoprecipitated overnight at 4°C with anti-5hmC antibody (Active Motif) in 500 μl IP 
buffer (10 mM sodium phosphate, 140 mM NaCl, 0.05% Triton X-100). DNA was eluted 
from the beads followed by purification with the chromatin IP DNA purification kit (Active 
Motif).
Flow cytometry and cytokines secretion assays
Cell surface marker staining and flow cytometric analysis for CD3, CD4, CD8, CD45, 
F4/80, and CD11b (Biolegend) expression was performed as described46. For MDSC 
analysis, mouse MDSC flow cocktail kit (Biolegend) was used. For intracellular staining for 
FOXP3 (Biolegend), True-Nuclear Transcription Factor Buffer Set (Biolegend) was used. To 
measure T cell cytokine production for effector CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, TICs were treated 
with Cell Activation Cocktail (Biolegend) for at least 4 hr at 37° before staining for TNF-α 
and IFN-γ (Biolegend).
In vivo models
All animal studies were performed under protocols approved by the Institutional Review 
Board of the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, La Jolla, U.S.A. This study is compliant 
with all relevant ethical regulations regarding animal research. Cells were trypsinized and 
resuspended in PBS/Matrigel (1:1; BD Biosciences). Suspended cells were then subjected to 
mammary fat pad injection or subcutaneous injection of C57BL/6 mice or IFNαβR−/− 
mice. Tumor size was measured by caliper. Tumor biospecimens were collected at a similar 
size for immune cell profiling analysis or gene expression analysis. After six weeks, all of 
the tumors were collected and the animals were sacrificed.
High-throughput whole transcriptome (mRNA-Seq) and small RNA-Seq
Total RNA was isolated by the Trizol reagent (Invitrogen Life Technologies) and treated 
with DNase. Invitrogen Qubit and Agilent Tape Station were used to determine RNA 
concentration and RNA integrity (RIN) numbers respectively, prior to library preparation. 
Stranded mRNA-Seq libraries were prepared using the Illumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA 
Library Prep Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, RNA with poly-A tail 
was isolated using magnetic beads conjugated to poly-T oligos. mRNA was then fragmented 
and reverse-transcribed into cDNA. dUTPs were incorporated, followed by second strand 
cDNA synthesis. dUTP-incorporated second strand was not amplified. cDNA was then end-
repaired, index adapter-ligated and PCR amplified. AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter) 
were used to purify nucleic acid after each steps of the library prep. Small RNA libraries 
were generated using NEB Next Multiplex Small RNA Library Prep Set for Illumina 
according to vendor’s instructions (New England Biolabs). Briefly, 3′ SR Adaptor was

 ligated to short RNAs at 25C for 1 hr. SR RT Primer was added to hybridize any un-ligated 
3′SR adaptor to prevent adaptor-dimer formation. 5′ SR Adaptor was then ligated, followed 
by reverse transcription and PCR amplification to add indexes to each library. Amplified 
libraries were TBE-PAGE gel purified (130–150bp). All sequencing libraries were then 
quantified, pooled and sequenced at single-end 50 base-pair (bp) on Illumina HiSeq 2500 at 
the Salk NGS Core. Raw sequencing data was de-multiplexed and converted into FASTQ 
files using CASAVA (v1.8.2).
RNA-Seq Analysis
Sequenced reads were quality-tested using FASTQC and aligned to the hg19 human genome 
using the STAR aligner. Mapping was carried out using default parameters (up to 10 
mismatches per read, and up to 9 multi-mapping locations per read). The genome index was 
constructed using the gene annotation supplied with the hg19 Illumina iGenomes collection 
and sjdbOverhang value of 100. FPKM normalized expression was quantified across all 
gene exons (RNA-Seq), using the top-expressed isoform as proxy for gene expression, and 
differential genes were defined as having a log2 fold change > 0.5 after the addition of a 
pseudocount of 5 to control for low-expressing noisy genes. The normalized expression table 
for all genes, and lists of differential genes is provided as supplementary data.
Clinical sample collection and evaluation of immunohistochemistry
Adequate surgical specimens from 148 breast invasive duct carcinoma (IDC) patients with 
relevant pathological information were collected from 1992 to 2005. This study was 
approved by The Institutional Review Board, Salk Institute for Biological Studies. The study 
is compliant with all relevant ethical regulations and informed consent was obtained by all 
participants. Tissue microarray slides were comprised of 45 of grade I cases, 53 of grade II 
cases and 50 of grade III cases. The histopathological differentiation of breast invasive duct 
carcinoma was determined on the basis of the WHO classification criteria for tumors. The 
pathological diagnosis for each cases was under blind examination by at least two senior 
pathologists. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed using an EnVision Dual Link 
System-HRP (DAB+) kit. To evaluate the immunoreactivity of cGAS, cases were scored 
from 0 to 3+ (0, negative; 1+, low expression; 2+, intermediate expression; 3+, high 
expression) on the basis of the intensity of cGAS staining.
Statistics and reproducibility
For animal experiments no statistical method was used to predetermine sample size and the 
experiments were not randomized. The investigators were not blinded to allocation during 
experiments and outcome assessment. All data were reported as mean ± SD. Statistical 
analysis was performed by using Student’s t test and p<0.05 was considered significant. The 
prognostic significance of the clinicopathological parameters related to survival rate was 
assessed by Kaplan–Meier analysis. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 
version 20 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USC). The results relative to miRNAs expression in 
human breast cancer are based on data generated by The Cancer Genome Atlas pilot project 
(TCGA) established by the NCI and NHGRI. Information about TCGA can be found at

 Figure 1. miR25/93 induced by hypoxia drives immunosuppression
(a) Upper: Correlation between regions of hypoxia (defined by hypoxyprobe) and regions of 
high HIF-1α in murine tumor samples. Lower: Screening for hypoxic murine tumor 
samples. Endogenous HIF-1α was used as an indicator for hypoxia. E0771 cells were used 
for tumor formation. The scale bars represent 50 μm. (b and c) Gene expression analysis for 
selected genes responsible for either anti-tumor immunity or tumor-promoting effects in 
hypoxic tumor samples, compared with non-hypoxic tumor samples. Anti-tumor immunity 
factors include Ifn-γ, Il-12, Cxcl10, lfit1, and Tbx21. Tumor-promoting factors include 
Il-10, Il-1, and Il-17. (d) The percentage of effector CD8+ cytotoxic T cells was decreased in 
HIF-1α overexpressing tumors. Changes in effector CD8+ cytotoxic T cells normalized to 
total CD8+ T cell proportions. Effector CD8+ cytotoxic T cells were defined by the 
production of TNF-α and IFN-γ. E0771 cells expressing HIF-1α or empty vector were used 
for tumor formation. (e) HIF-1α-overexpressing tumors showed significantly higher 
recruitment of CD4+FoxP3+Tregs. (f) Gene expression analysis for anti-tumor immunity 
factors in whole-tumor homogenates derived from HIF-1α-overexpressing tumors or control 
tumors. (g) The level of tumor promoting factors was increased in HIF-1α-overexpressing 
tumors vs. control tumors. For panels b and c, control: n=8 tumors from 8 different animals,

HIF-1α-overexpressing tumors vs. control tumors. (d) Inhibiting miR25/93 reduced tumor 
growth in wild type mice. (e) Reduced tumor growth by the inhibition of miR25/93 was 
diminished in immune-deficient mice (NOD-Rag1nullIL2rgnull). (f) Suppression of 
miR25/93 reduced HIF-1α-enhanced tumor growth. (g) Restoration of effector CD8+ 
cytotoxic T cells in HIF-1α-overexpressing tumors by suppressing miR25/93. (h) Levels of 
CD4+FoxP3+ Tregs in control tumors, HIF-1α-overexpressing tumors, and HIF-1α-
miR25/93-si tumors. (i) Overexpression of miR25/93 led to increased tumor proliferation. (j) 
The percentage of effector CD8+ cytotoxic T cells was decreased in miR25/93-
overexpressing tumors. Changes in effector CD8+ cytotoxic T cells normalized to total

TNF-α and IFN-γ. (k) miR25/93-overexpressing tumors attracted more CD4+FoxP3+ Tregs 
than control tumors. For panel a, n=3 independent experiments. For panels b and c, n=3 
tumors from 3 different animals. For panels g and h, n=5 tumors from 5 different animals. 
For panels j and k, control: n=10 tumors from 10 different animals, miR25/93: n=13 tumors 
from 13 different animals. For panel i, n = 8 tumors from 8 different mice for each group.

 Figure 4. Hypoxia-TET1-miR25/93 signaling axis reduces cGAS-mediated immune response
(a) MCF7 or MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with HT-DNA, followed by hypoxia 
treatment for 18 h. IFN-β expression was measured by RT-qPCR as an indicator of cGAS-
mediated immune response. (b and c) Down-regulation of TET1 restored IFN-β expression 
in the presence of HT-DNA upon hypoxia. (d and e) The inhibitory effect of hypoxia on 
immune response was reduced by inactivation of miR25/93. (f and g) cGAS deficiency 
significantly impaired HT-DNA-induced immune response. (h and i) The immune phenotype 
of MCF7 or MDA-MB-231 cells stably expressing shRNAs against miR25/93 was reversed 
by knocking down cGAS expression. Control cells express shRNA targeting EGFP. N: 
normoxia H: hypoxia. All data presented here are mean ± SD (n=3 independent 
experiments). Samples were compared using two-tailed Student’s t test. *p< 0.05. Statistics

 Figure 8. The correlation of miR25/93-cGAS with prognosis for patients with cancer
(a) TCGA analysis for miR25 or miR93 indicated that levels of these miRNAs correlated 
with poor survival of patients with brain, colon, or breast tumors. (b) The clinical relevance 
of levels of miR25/93 in cancer patients with breast invasive carcinoma. (c) IHC staining for 
cGAS levels for different grades of IDC revealed an inverse correlation between cGAS 
levels and tumor grades. The scale bars represent 50 μm. (d) Overall survival analysis for 
148 patients with IDC showed an inverse correlation between cGAS levels and poor survival 
of cancer patients. The intensity of cGAS staining from low to high was divided into two 
group (0 and 1+, 2+ and 3+). n= 12 for 0, negative; n=56 for 1+, low expression; n=74 for 
2+, intermediate expression; n=6 for 3+, high expression. n represents the number of patient 
samples for each group. (e) TCGA analysis indicated reduced overall survival of breast 
cancer patients harboring lower levels of cGAS and higher levels of miR93. (f) A model of 
miR25/93-mediated immune escape of hypoxic tumors from DAMP-induced immune stress. 
Sample numbers and p values are indicated in the panel for TCGA analysis and IHC study.
