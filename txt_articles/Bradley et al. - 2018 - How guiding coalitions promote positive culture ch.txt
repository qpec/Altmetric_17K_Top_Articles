AbstrAct
Background Quality collaboratives are widely endorsed 
as a potentially effective method for translating and 
spreading best practices for acute myocardial infarction 
(AMI) care. Nevertheless, hospital success in improving 
performance through participation in collaboratives varies 
markedly. We sought to understand what distinguished 
hospitals that succeeded in shifting culture and reducing 
30-day risk-standardised mortality rate (RSMR) after AMI 
through their participation in the Leadership Saves Lives 
(LSL) collaborative.
Procedures We conducted a longitudinal, mixed 
methods intervention study of 10 hospitals over a 
2-year period; data included surveys of 223 individuals 
(response rates 83%–94% depending on wave) and 
393 in-depth interviews with clinical and management 
staff most engaged with the LSL intervention in the 10 
hospitals. We measured change in culture and RSMR, 
and key aspects of working related to team membership, 
turnover, level of participation and approaches to conflict 
management.
Main findings The six hospitals that experienced 
substantial culture change and greater reductions 
in RSMR demonstrated distinctions in: (1) effective 
inclusion of staff from different disciplines and levels 
in the organisational hierarchy in the team guiding 
improvement efforts (referred to as the ‘guiding coalition’ 
in each hospital); (2) authentic participation in the work 
of the guiding coalition; and (3) distinct patterns of 
managing conflict. Guiding coalition size and turnover 
were not associated with success (p values>0.05). In the 
six hospitals that experienced substantial positive culture 
change, staff indicated that the LSL learnings were 
already being applied to other improvement efforts.
Principal conclusions Hospitals that were most 
successful in a national quality collaborative to shift 
hospital culture and reduce RSMR showed distinct 
patterns in membership diversity, authentic participation 
and capacity for conflict management.
IntroductIon
Quality collaboratives and campaigns 
are widely endorsed by researchers and 
policymakers as a potentially effective 
method1 for translating and spreading 
best practices for acute myocardial infarc-
tion (AMI) care. Such efforts convene 
hospitals to share experiences, promote 
adoption of evidence-based practices, and 
foster systematic approaches to quality 
improvement.2 The last 15 years have 
seen a number of quality collaboratives 
focusing on AMI care, such as Get with 
the Guidelines3 and the Door-to-Balloon 
Alliance,4–9 and a concomitant reduc-
tion in AMI mortality. Based on recent 
evidence about the influence of hospital 
culture on AMI mortality,10–12 the Leader-
ship Saves Lives (LSL) quality collabora-
tive13 was a national effort of 10 hospitals 
to improve hospital culture and reduce 
30-day risk-standardised mortality rate 
(RSMR) after AMI over 2 
years.13 
Although quality collaboratives have been 
associated with hospital improvements, 
not all hospitals that participate in collab-
oratives experience substantial gains, and 
some continue to lag despite similar expo-
sure to collaborative interventions.2 14–17 
T
wo features distinguish hospitals that 
have 
experienced 
larger 
performance 
gains through their participation in quality 
collaboratives. The first of these is strong 
senior management support for improve-
ment efforts.18–25 Studies highlight specific 
behaviours by senior management that seem 
to matter, which include but are not limited 
to: maintaining visibility in improvement 
efforts, connecting efforts to the organi-
sational mission, engaging front-line staff, 
providing necessary resources and estab-
lishing accountability for performance.18–25 
The second feature that has been found 
to distinguish higher performing hospi-
tals within quality collaboratives is team-
work.16 17 22 26 27 These studies indicate that

Original research
teams in hospitals that achieve the goals of quality collab-
oratives are more likely to know and respect each other, 
have stable membership and have effective team leader-
ship.28–35 Although this literature is useful, we could find 
no longitudinal studies with rich qualitative and quan-
titative data that have examined how hospitals develop 
(or fail to develop) these capacities within the context 
of a quality collaborative. Understanding this process of 
development could enhance the potential for hospitals to 
maximise the positive impact of participation in quality 
collaboratives.
Accordingly, we sought to understand what distin-
guished hospitals that succeeded to shift culture 
substantially and to reduce 30-day RSMR after 
AMI through participation in the LSL collaborative. 
We focused on the experience of the multidisciplinary 
team created to guide the collaborative efforts in each 
hospital; we refer to this team as the hospital ‘guiding 
coalition,’ using the term introduced as part of the 
National Demonstration in Quality Improvement36 
and used broadly in the change management litera-
ture.37 38 As part of the collaborative, each hospital was 
asked to appoint a guiding coalition to guide improve-
ment efforts, which included approximately 15 multi-
disciplinary staff involved in care of patients with 
AMI. The findings may be useful for hospitals seeking 
to maximise the impact of their participation in quality 
collaboratives, and to healthcare professionals seeking 
to design successful improvement efforts.
Methods
Study design and sample
We used quantitative and qualitative data from a longi-
tudinal, convergent mixed methods interventional 
study39 40 in which 10 of 12 hospitals approached 
(participation rate 83%; table 1) participated in a 
quality collaborative to improve aspects of organi-
sational culture shown to be associated with lower 
30-day RSMR after AMI. Hospitals were selected 
using random sampling with a purposive component,41 
begining with a randomised list of sampling units 
but may omit units that are too similar to previously 
selected units, to ensure a diverse sample. We drew from 
members of the Mayo Clinic Care Network (MCCN), a 
national group of regional medical systems committed 
to quality improvement through collaboration. From 
the 21 MCCN members as of January 2014, we iden-
tified those meeting eligibility criteria, including: (1) at 
least 200 AMI discharges per year in order to ensure 
depth of experience in caring for patients with AMI; 
(2) for multihospital systems, the largest hospital in the 
system; and (3) 30-day RSMR after AMI that were at 
or above the national median between 2009 and 2012 
to indicate room for improvement. We randomised the 
list of eligible hospitals (n=18), and beginning from 
the top, worked in sequence down the list to recruit 
10 hospitals that were diverse in teaching status and 
geographic region (based on US Census categories). 
Across the participating hospitals, we surveyed 223 
individuals (table 2). Survey response rates at baseline, 
12-month and 24-month waves were 88% (147/168), 
83% (154/186) and 94% (167/178), respectively. We 
also conducted 393 in-depth interviews at baseline 
(n=162), 6 months (n=118) and 18 months (n=113) 
with a total of 197 individual respondents (table 2).
The LSL intervention
The 2-year intervention, previously described in 
detail,13 was designed to foster key dimensions of 
organisational culture that are relevant to hospital 
performance (eg, learning environment, psychological 
safety, commitment to the organisation, senior leader-
ship support and time for improvement efforts).10 42 43

that included approximately 15 key staff involved in 
care of patients with AMI. Coalition members included 
staff from multiple departments (eg, cardiology, emer-
gency medicine, pharmacy, quality improvement, 
cardiac rehabilitation), professions (eg, physicians, 
nurses, technologists, administrators, physician assis-
tants) and levels of the organisation (from senior exec-
utives to front-line staff).
In each hospital, all guiding coalition members 
participated in four 1-day, on-site workshops during 
the study period, and a subset of 4 of these members 
participated in three all-hospital annual forums to 
promote sharing of experiences across hospitals. 
The workshop curriculum (see online supplemen-
tary appendix A) was grounded in a strategic prob-
lem-solving approach44 in which coalitions sought to 
foster organisational culture to promote better perfor-
mance as they implemented evidence-based strategies 
associated with lower RSMRs.11 Networking among 
hospitals and access to related programme materials 
were facilitated through a web-based platform (Base-
camp Software V
.3; Chicago, Illinois).
Data collection and measures
We assessed organisational culture using a validated, 
31-item close-ended instrument (see online supplemen-
tary appendix B) consisting of five domains: learning 
and problem solving, psychological safety, commitment 
to the organisation, senior leadership support and time 
for improvement efforts. The survey was administered 
to all guiding coalition members at baseline, 12 months 
and 24 months. In addition, we used a standard discus-
sion guide (see online supplementary appendix C) to 
conduct in-person, in-depth interviews41 of guiding 
coalition members at baseline, 6 months and 18 months. 
Lasting on average an hour, the interviews generated 
extensive qualitative data. We also conducted 56 
hours 
of selective observations of key interactions in care for 
patients with AMI (eg, patient rounds, relevant meetings 
and other on-site activities) at baseline (40 
hours) and 
18 months (16 
hours), and took field notes during these 
observations. All research procedures were approved by 
the Human Investigation Committee at the Yale Human 
Research Protection Program at Yale School of Medi-
cine. Given the negligible risks for participation, the 
study was determined to be exempt from Institutional 
Review Board review; all study participants provided 
their verbal informed consent to participate in this study.
Data analysis
Hospitals were deemed to have experienced substan-
tial culture shift if they met at least one of two criteria. 
As recommended in convergent, mixed methods 
studies,39 40 the criteria were quantitative and quali-
tative. The quantitative criterion was a statistically 
significant change in the overall culture score between 
baseline and 2-year follow-up using a 95% confidence 
level for significance. The qualitative criterion was 
a marked shift in culture within domains previously 
validated45: (1) learning and problem solving; (2) 
senior leadership support; (3) psychological safety; 
(4) commitment to the organisation; and (5) time 
for improvement, and as expressed by hospital staff 
through in-depth interviews from baseline to 2 
years 
of follow-up. T
wo hospitals (IDs A and I) experi-
enced statistically significant and marked qualitative 
shifts in culture, and four additional hospitals (IDs 
C, F, G and J) experienced marked qualitative shifts 
although the quantitative change did not reach statis-
tical significance. The remaining four hospitals (IDs B, 
D, E and H) experienced neither statistically signifi-
cant nor marked qualitative changes in culture. Thus, 
we compared the experiences of the six hospitals that 
experienced substantial culture change as measured 
quantitatively or qualitatively with the four hospitals 
that did not.
To examine trends in RSMR before and during 
the intervention,we obtained RSMR values for each 
participating hospital from CMS Hospital Compare. 
CMS reports 3-year averages in RSMR; thus, we 
examined changes in hospital RSMRs between July 
2011 and June 2014(the period immediately preceding 
the intervention)and July 2012 and June 2015, the 
most contemporary data available. We also exam-
ined RSMRs from theJuly 2010 to June 2013 period 
to understand subsequent changes in the context of 
longer trends. Between the 2011–2014 and 2012–
2015 reporting periods, the six hospitals that expe-
rienced substantial culture shifts showed significantly 
greater decreases in mean RSMR compared with 
changes in mean RSMR among the four hospitals that 
did not and compared with changes in mean RSMR 
nationally. Changes in hospital RSMRs prior to the 
LSL launch (2010–2013 to 2011–2014) did not differ 
significantly between the six hospitals that experi-
enced substantial culture change and the four that did 
not, or between either group and the national average 
(p>0.05). Among the six hospitals that had substantial 
culture shifts, the RSMR decreased significantly from 
2011–2014 to 2012–2015 (mean difference 1.07, p 
value for paired t-test p=0.003), while among the four 
hospitals without substantial culture change the mean 
difference was not significant (mean difference for 
four hospitals was 0.23, p=0.40 for paired t-test).46
In addition to the qualitative analysis, we calculated 
t-tests to compare average coalition sizes and turnover 
rates between the six hospitals that achieved substan-
tial positive culture change, as determined by quanti-
tative and qualitative data (hospitals A, C, F, G, I and 
J) and the four hospitals that did not (hospitals B, D, 
E and H). Using a confidence level of 95%, we tested 
the hypotheses that hospitals with larger guiding 
coalitions with less turnover would be more likely to 
achieve substantial culture shifts through their partic-
ipation in LSL.

Overview
The experience of the guiding coalitions, all of which 
were exposed to the same intervention protocol over 
the same period of time, varied markedly across the 
10 hospitals. In the six hospitals that demonstrated 
substantial positive shifts in culture, we found (1) 
representation of staff from different disciplines and 
levels in the organisational hierarchy; (2) authentic 
participation and engagement of diverse perspectives 
in the work of the guiding coalition; and (3) distinct 
patterns of managing conflict, fatigue and motivation 
over time. Participants from the remaining four hospi-
tals, which did not experience shifts in culture, expe-
rienced challenges in recruiting and retaining diverse 
staff to the guiding coalition, experienced superficial 
participation of staff who did attend, and had diffi-
culty managing conflict, blame or boredom within the 
guiding coalition. Below we elaborate these themes 
describing the contrasts between experiences in the six 
hospitals that achieved culture shifts compared with 
the four hospitals that did not.
Membership in the guiding coalition
Neither the size nor the turnover rates of the guiding 
coalition members varied significantly between the 
six hospitals with culture shifts and the four without 
(average size 21 vs 18 members, p value 0.21; average 
turnover rate 26% vs 22% of starting guiding coali-
tion, p value 0.50, respectively). Nevertheless, the 
guiding coalitions in the six hospitals that experienced 
substantial culture shifts had starkly different experi-
ences than the guiding coalitions did in the four hospi-
tals without culture change.
In the six hospitals that had substantial positive 
culture shifts, coalitions achieved diverse member-
ship, both across departmental lines but also including 
both front-line, mid-level, and top leadership clinical 
and administrative staff. As they undertook efforts to 
implement evidence-based practices, the coalitions 
recognised gaps in their membership and addressed 
them. For instance, in the course of their work, one 
hospital noted they had omitted case management 
from the original group. Recognising that posthospital 
care was central to reducing 30-day mortality, they 
promptly added a case manager. At the same time, in 
cases where members became disengaged and appeared 
not to be contributing, coalitions allowed for turnover 
with replacement as needed. In general, staff in these 
hospitals understood that diverse membership was 
critical for both discovering the root causes of prob-
lems and fostering team ownership of the problem and 
potential solutions, as illustrated by one nurse,
“That was the ‘ah-hah’ moment, where we knew—if 
we’re going to do this root cause analysis, we need 
to have the right people in the room. So we had a 
meeting with all the right stakeholders and people 
being able to walk out of here owning what they can 
do.” (IDI_3, Nurse)
This perspective was in stark contrast to experiences 
in the four hospitals that did not experience culture 
change. In these hospitals, staff described having diffi-
culty constructing adequately diverse guiding coali-
tions. Some included nursing without recognising 
diversity within nursing (eg, nurse managers vs staff 
nurses, or nurses on patient care units vs those in 
the catheterisation laboratory). Other hospitals split 
the guiding coalition into smaller groups to increase 
efficiency but then were unable to capitalise on the 
diversity of the larger group. One quality manager 
described,
“It’s been kinda painful getting the group to coalesce, 
and getting traction. Here we are a year into it 
and I feel like we just started.” (IDH_1, Quality 
Management Staff)
Participation by members
In the six hospitals with substantial positive culture 
change, participation in the guiding coalition was 
marked by discovery, learning, and teaching among 
and between members, and across staff who operated 
at different levels in the hospital hierarchy. A para-
medic enthusiastically reported,
“‘Every time I come to a meeting, I learn something.’ 
Reflecting further, he said, ‘and they ask me for my 
input. I am not just a fly on the wall here. I appreciate 
that’.” (IDA_1, Paramedic)
Staff across these hospitals remarked that participa-
tion was authentic, which was described as being clear 
about expectations and performance. One cardiologist 
noted,
“‘I found that as a group, we had lots of talents that 
suddenly got brought to bear that I didn’t even know 
were there.’ People that had time and energy to do it 
all of a sudden just jumped into the fray and started 
working.” (IDJ_3, Cardiologist)
High levels of participation did not commence 
instantly; rather it emerged over time as members 
began to offer their unique skills and perspectives to 
the shared task. An emergency medicine physician 
described this evolution,

Original research
“I think [we] transitioned from everyone telling 
everyone else what to do to looking at themselves and 
saying this is what we’re going to do make this work. 
That was really a turning point.” (IDC_8, Emergency 
Medicine Physician)
In contrast, staff from the four hospitals that did not 
experience culture shifts described the work falling to 
a single department, typically quality management. 
Coalition members described being in attendance but 
‘quiet’ and not authentically participating in the work 
of the group. At different hospitals, staff said,
“We were participating because somebody wanted 
us to. Somebody higher up said, ‘You’re going to 
participate’.” (IDD_14, Quality Management Staff)
 
“I feel like we haven’t yet gotten to the meat of the 
matter. I feel like we’re lost. We’re creating lots of 
pretty things to look at and totally missing the point.” 
(IDH_7, Nurse)
Managing conflict, fatigue and engagement
Managing conflict, fatigue and engagement was a 
universal experience shared across all intervention 
hospitals. The guiding coalitions in all 10 hospitals 
faced moments of conflict among their membership. 
In some hospitals, conflict was expressed in blaming 
behaviours, across departmental lines (eg, the emer-
gency department and the catheterisation laboratory) 
and across hierarchy (eg, front-line clinical and clinical 
management staff). In other hospitals, staff reflected 
more passive manifestations of conflict, such as ‘falling 
asleep when someone else was talking’, ‘getting people 
off track’ or obfuscating the issues.
Prominent in six hospitals with substantial positive 
culture change and largely absent in the four hospitals 
that did not experience culture change was the use of 
an array of tactics for managing conflict and sustaining 
genuine engagement. Staff described being cognisant 
of not wasting people’s time, having clear roles and 
defining work to be delivered between meetings. 
Some groups broke into subgroups for specific tasks 
but continued to link to the full coalition. Additionally, 
members of these coalitions reported they were careful 
to be sure opinions were not ignored while still keeping 
the group ‘on task.’ Staff reported that revisiting of 
the larger goal of improving AMI care helped align 
and reinvigorate staff when they became distracted 
or overburdened. One Vice President described refo-
cusing the coalition,
“The other thing that we said is, ‘It’s not just about 
us…It’s about population health, chronic disease 
management, how we take care of people when they’re 
at home.…We know we can’t do that without really 
high-level collaboration’.” (IDF_15, Vice President)
In the four hospitals that did not experience culture 
change, coalition members described an environment 
in which attendance at agreed-upon meetings was 
unreliable and blaming behaviours persisted. One 
Chief Medical Officer commented on lack of trust 
among the coalition,
“The cardiologists tell me that it’s the emergency 
room’s (ER’s) fault because they don’t know how to 
read EKGs. When, in fact, the cardiologists have said, 
‘We don’t want the activation from the field. There’s a 
lot of incongruity between what the cardiologists are 
saying and what they’re actually doing [and between] 
what the ER is saying and what they’re actually doing. 
It’s not a real trusting environment’.” (IDB_9, Chief 
Medical Officer)
Views on future use of LSL learnings
Staff estimations of the likelihood of applying the 
learnings from LSL to other projects and areas in the 
hospital varied substantially. Staff from guiding coali-
tions in the four hospitals that did not make notice-
able culture changes were less certain that the LSL 
approach would continue, citing that few people 
understood the work of the guiding coalition and 
that it had been difficult to demonstrate its ‘return 
on investment.’ In contrast, staff in the six hospitals 
that experience marked culture shifts were optimistic 
about ‘ingraining’ the LSL approach into other areas. 
For example, staff reported that the learnings from 
the guiding coalition approach might be applied to 
improve the quality of care for patients with complex 
conditions such as heart failure and stroke care, reduce 
unplanned readmission rates, and achieve population 
health goals.
dIscussIon
We identified key aspects of guiding coalition member-
ship, participation and conflict management capacities 
that were prominent in the six hospitals that achieved 
positive culture change and absent in the four hospi-
tals that did not. Guiding coalition members in the 
six hospitals with substantial positive culture change 
represented multiple disciplines and departments and 
worked at different levels of the hospital hierarchy, or 
even outside the hospital (such as emergency medical 
services or private cardiologists). Furthermore, they 
were successful in fostering meaningful participa-
tion by the members. Last, they were able to manage 
conflict in ways that energised and sustained the work 
of the coalition. Although other studies have suggested 
that team size and turnover may influence effective-
ness,27 52–54 in this study with rich qualitative data, we 
were able to identify nuanced aspects of both inputs and 
processes, as suggested by West and Lyubovnikova,55 
of guiding coalitions that may explain their differential 
success.
Our study extends the previous literature by identi-
fying concrete characteristics and actions guiding coali-
tions implement that maximise the impact of teamwork 
and senior management support on culture. Our results

also indicate that turnover is not tantamount to failure. 
Rather, successful coalitions built a way of working 
together that conferred resiliency in the face of turn-
over and resource challenges. Importantly, both team-
work and leadership from senior management were 
fundamentally interwoven in the work of successful 
guiding coalitions. Also critical to the guiding coalitions 
in the successful hospitals was the sense of learning 
from others who had different experiences and perspec-
tives but were committed to the shared goal. Previous 
research has also identified ‘learning organizations’ as 
those that can withstand shifts in marketplaces and tech-
nologies56 57; our study demonstrated the importance 
of membership, participation and conflict management 
capabilities to enable such a learning environment, 
which allows groups to solve problems effectively.58–60
Our findings should be understood in light of some 
limitations. First, the LSL intervention was not designed 
as a randomised controlled trial, which limited our 
ability to make statistical inferences. It is possible that 
unmeasured factors in the context of the six hospitals 
and not apparent in the four might explain our find-
ings. Nevertheless, our longitudinal, convergent mixed 
methods intervention design39 40 was well suited to 
understanding how guiding coalitions worked within 
their contexts, the central phenomenon of interest. 
Throughout, we applied rigorous methods of in-depth 
inquiry, observation and qualitative data analysis to 
mitigate effects of omitted data or bias. Second, given 
the in-depth nature of the intervention,13 we focused 
on 10 hospitals, and although they were diverse in 
terms of geographical location and size, results may 
differ in other settings. Last, it is possible that the 
findings were influenced by the Hawthorne effect61 in 
which the act of observing changes behaviours of the 
observed or that social desirability bias62 occurred. As 
others have shown,63 measuring organisational culture 
is highly complex. Nevertheless, we worked to miti-
gate these biases by conducting both observations and 
interviews over time to triangulate what we were told. 
Additionally, we applied multiple methods to limit 
bias including multiple interviewers and analyst from 
varying backgrounds, a consistent protocol for data 
collection and analysis, and a detailed audit trail to 
document analytical decisions.
In conclusion, although previous work has docu-
mented the effectiveness of the LSL intervention on 
influencing the organisational culture and RSMR in 6 
of the 10 hospitals, this study addressed the question 
of how the membership, participation and conflict 
management capacities of the guiding coalitions may 
have allowed for differential success across the 10 
participating hospitals. The implication of these find-
ings is that careful attention to the design and activities 
of such coalitions, together with developing capacity 
for managing inevitable challenges such as turnover 
and conflict, may help hospitals increase the benefits 
of participation in quality collaboratives.
