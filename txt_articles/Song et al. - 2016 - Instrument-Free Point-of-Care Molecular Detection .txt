Subject: Revised diagnostic testing for Zika, chikungunya, and dengue viruses in US Public 
Health Laboratories 
 
Background 
Many countries in the Americas now have local transmission of multiple arboviruses that can 
cause febrile illness with rash, myalgia, or arthralgia. Therefore, laboratory testing has become 
even more important to confirm the etiology of these diseases. Zika, chikungunya, and dengue 
virus infections should all be considered for patients with acute fever, rash, myalgia, or 
arthralgia who have traveled within the previous 2 weeks to an area with ongoing transmission 
or are living in an area with ongoing transmission. In accordance with the Updated Interim 
Guidelines for Health Care Providers Caring for Pregnant Women and Women of Reproductive 
Age During Ongoing Zika Virus Transmission — United States, 2016 
(http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/wr/mm6505e2er.htm), this test algorithm now 
includes a recommendation to offer serologic testing to asymptomatic pregnant women with a 
history of travel to areas with local transmission of Zika virus or are living in an area with 
ongoing transmission. Laboratory evidence of recent chikungunya, dengue, or Zika virus 
infection is generally accomplished by testing serum to detect viral nucleic acid or virus-
specific immunoglobulin (Ig) M and neutralizing antibodies. However, serological cross-
reactivity may occur between Zika and other flaviviruses (e.g., dengue, yellow fever, St. Louis 
encephalitis, Japanese encephalitis, West Nile), so emphasis should be placed on molecular 
testing (RT-PCR) in acute specimens received from individuals with clinically compatible 
illness. Laboratory testing for Zika, chikungunya, and dengue viruses is currently available at 
CDC and several state and territory health departments. 
 
Laboratory assays for acute specimens  
During the first 7 days of these illnesses, viral RNA can often be identified in serum, and RT-
PCR is the preferred test for Zika, chikungunya, and dengue viruses. In addition, for dengue 
viruses, NS1 antigen can be detected by ELISA in acute phase specimens but this assay is not 
widely available in the US. Because viremia decreases over time, a negative RT-PCR collected 
5-7 days after symptom onset does not exclude flavivirus infection and serologic testing should 
be performed. 
 
Virus-specific IgM antibodies may be detectable >4 days after onset of illness. However, serum 
collected within 7 days of illness onset may not have detectable virus-specific IgM antibodies. 
IgM antibodies against Zika virus, dengue viruses, and other flaviviruses have strong cross-
reactivity which may generate false positive results in serological tests.

Laboratory assays for convalescent specimens  
IgM antibodies typically persist for approximately 2-12 weeks. In patients with a compatible 
clinical syndrome, serum collected as early as 4 days after illness onset can be tested by Zika, 
chikungunya, and dengue virus-specific IgM ELISA and positive results confirmed by testing 
for neutralizing antibodies (Figure 1).  
 
Due to serological cross-reactivity between flaviviruses, current IgM antibody assays cannot 
reliably distinguish between Zika and dengue virus infections. Therefore, an IgM positive result 
in a dengue or Zika IgM ELISA test should be considered indicative of a recent flavivirus 
infection. Plaque-reduction neutralization tests (PRNT) can be performed to measure virus-
specific neutralizing antibodies and may be able to determine the cause of primary flavivirus 
infection. In patients who have received yellow fever or Japanese encephalitis vaccination or 
infected with another flavivirus in the past, cross-reactive antibodies in both the IgM and 
neutralizing antibody assays may make it difficult to identify which flavivirus is causing the 
patient’s current illness. 
 
Serologic testing for Zika virus infection may be performed on serum specimens from 
asymptomatic pregnant women (Figure 2). Serologic test interpretation is complex; a positive 
IgM result can be difficult to interpret since cross-reactivity can occur with related flaviviruses. 
PRNT may be able to discriminate between cross-reacting antibodies in primary flavivirus 
infections. In addition, a negative Zika IgM result obtained 2-12 weeks after travel suggests 
that infection did not occur. Based on experience with other flaviviruses, we expect that 
antibodies will be present at least 2 weeks after virus exposure and persist for at least 12 weeks. 
Information about the performance of serologic testing of asymptomatic individuals is limited.  
 
As with any diagnostic test, while a negative Zika IgM or RT-PCR test would suggest that an 
infection has not occurred, a negative Zika IgM or RT-PCR test result does not rule out 
infection with Zika virus.

Exposure — United States, 2016

Laboratory safety 
Zika and dengue viruses are classified as biological safety level (BSL) 2 pathogens while 
chikungunya virus is classified as a BSL-3 agent. All should be handled in accordance with 
Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (BMBL) guidelines and a risk 
assessment performed for each laboratory for the specific procedures utilized. Until the 
association between Zika virus infection and congenital microcephaly is better understood, 
pregnancy should be considered a significant factor in risk assessment for individuals working 
with Zika virus, and the involvement of pregnant workers in studies with Zika virus should be 
minimized. It is recommended that laboratories perform a risk assessment when bringing on 
new tests, and safety precautions should be based on each laboratory’s risk assessment. In 
particular, because chikungunya virus produces such high levels of viremia, serum from 
suspected chikungunya virus cases should be treated as potentially infectious even for 
serological procedures. For further information, see: BMBL

Options for obtaining/conducting Zika, chikungunya, and dengue virus 
diagnostic testing 
  
CDC  
Zika, chikungunya, and dengue virus RT-PCR, IgM ELISA, and PRNT are performed at CDC. 
The specific tests performed will depend on the timing of the specimens relative to illness onset 
and clinical information as outlined in the algorithm figure. To determine the appropriate 
testing algorithm and interpret results, please provide the date of illness onset, dates of 
specimen collection, specimen type, description of clinical illness, travel history, flavivirus 
vaccination history, and contact information for the submitter. Testing will primarily be 
performed on serum or CSF but other specimen types, including urine, amniotic fluid, and 
tissues, can be submitted alongside a patient-matched serum specimen for evaluation of the 
utility of these specimen types. 
 
Within Puerto Rico, please call 787-706-2399 for questions about testing. For submission of 
specimens, please submit a dengue case investigation report (DCIR) for each specimen which 
can be downloaded from: http://www.cdc.gov/dengue/clinicalLab/index.html  
 
For all other states and territories, state health departments should contact the CDC Arboviral 
Diseases Branch at 970-221-6400. A completed DASH form should accompany submitted 
specimens. More information about submitting specimens to CDC is at: 
http://www.cdc.gov/ncezid/dvbd/specimensub/arboviral-shipping.html.   
 
State and Territory Health Department Laboratories  
RT-PCR: The CDC chikungunya virus and Zika virus RT-PCR protocols follow essentially the 
same protocol as the CDC West Nile virus RT-PCR assay. CDC will provide chikungunya and 
Zika virus primer/probe sequences, an RNA-positive control, and chikungunya and Zika virus 
RT-PCR proficiency panels to state and territory laboratories that have demonstrated 
proficiency at the CDC West Nile virus RT-PCR assay. Dengue virus RT-PCR kits can be 
ordered online using the following link: 
http://www.cdc.gov/dengue/clinicalLab/realTime.html  
 
Zika virus IgM ELISA: The CDC Zika virus IgM ELISA is similar to the CDC West Nile virus 
IgM ELISA assay. State and territory laboratories that have demonstrated proficiency in 
performing the CDC West Nile virus IgM ELISA during the 2015 evaluation can request Zika 
virus antigen, conjugated antibody, and positive control serum for use in the CDC Zika virus 
IgM ELISA.  
 
The CDC is currently working on a regulatory pathway to manufacture and distribute assays to 
support laboratory response to Zika. Further details will be shared when information becomes 
available. 
 
For state and territory health departments interested in obtaining the materials described 
above, please contact eocevent278@cdc.gov. If your state or territory health department 
laboratory does not perform the CDC West Nile virus RT-PCR assay or IgM ELISA assay, 
consider sending specimens to CDC or using one of the commercial options described below.

• Anti-CHIKV IIFT (IgM) (Euroimmun, Germany) 
 
Specimen collection and shipping 
If a patient is suspected of having a Zika, chikungunya, or dengue infection, a serum specimen 
must be collected. Other specimens may also be collected for testing in addition to the serum 
specimen including CSF, urine, amniotic fluid and tissues. Information on the patient 
including the date of illness onset, description of clinical illness, travel history, and flavivirus 
vaccination history should be documented. Additional information on specimen collection can 
be found at: http://www.cdc.gov/ncezid/dvbd/specimensub/arboviral-shipping.html 
 
Specimens collected from individuals for Zika virus studies may be transferred within the U.S. 
as Category B Biological substances in accordance with Department of Transportation 
Hazardous Materials Regulations (49 CFR Part 171-180). Guidance for packaging samples in 
accordance with Category B Biological substance requirements can be found in the CDC/NIH 
Publication Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories, 5th edition. Additional 
information about the Department of Transportation Hazardous Materials Transport 
Regulations may be found at https://www.transportation.gov/pipelines-hazmat. 
 
Reporting 
Zika, dengue, and chikungunya are all nationally notifiable conditions; state and territory 
health departments should report cases to CDC according to standard CSTE case definitions. 
State and territory health departments are requested to report laboratory-confirmed cases of 
any arbovirus to CDC through ArboNET, the national surveillance system for arboviral disease.
