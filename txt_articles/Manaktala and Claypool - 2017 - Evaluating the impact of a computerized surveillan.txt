ABSTRACT
Objective: We created a system using a triad of change management, electronic surveillance, and algorithms to
detect sepsis and deliver highly sensitive and specific decision support to the point of care using a mobile appli-
cation. The investigators hypothesized that this system would result in a reduction in sepsis mortality.
Methods: A before-and-after model was used to study the impact of the interventions on sepsis-related mortal-
ity. All patients admitted to the study units were screened per the Institute for Healthcare Improvement
Surviving Sepsis Guidelines using real-time electronic surveillance. Sepsis surveillance algorithms that ad-
justed clinical parameters based on comorbid medical conditions were deployed for improved sensitivity and
specificity. Nurses received mobile alerts for all positive sepsis screenings as well as severe sepsis and shock
alerts over a period of 10 months. Advice was given for early goal-directed therapy. Sepsis mortality during a
control period from January 1, 2011 to September 30, 2013 was used as baseline for comparison.
Results: The primary outcome, sepsis mortality, decreased by 53% (P ¼ 0.03; 95% CI, 1.06-5.25). The 30-day
readmission rate reduced from 19.08% during the control period to 13.21% during the study period (P ¼ 0.05;
95% CI, 0.97-2.52). No significant change in length of hospital stay was noted. The system had observed sensi-
tivity of 95% and specificity of 82% for detecting sepsis compared to gold-standard physician chart review.
Conclusion: A program consisting of change management and electronic surveillance with highly sensitive and
specific decision support delivered to the point of care resulted in significant reduction in deaths from sepsis.
Key words: sepsis, septic shock, clinical decision support, change management, electronic surveillance, sepsis mortality
BACKGROUND
Sepsis is a leading cause of death in the United States. Annually,
there are 750 000 deaths from severe sepsis in the United States.1 A
significant financial burden is associated with treating septic pa-
tients; the estimated treatment cost is around $20 billion annually in
the United States, making sepsis the costliest medical condition to
treat in this country.2 A strong body of evidence correlates early
goal-directed therapy (prompt diagnosis, antimicrobial therapy, risk
stratification,
and
hemodynamic
stabilization)
to
significant
reductions in sepsis-related mortality.3–7 Despite this evidence,
healthcare organizations continue to struggle to identify and treat
sepsis in a timely manner. Evidence suggests that patients who de-
velop sepsis on general hospital wards may experience delays in di-
agnosis, treatment, and transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU),
resulting in poor outcomes.8–10 Change management consisting of
sepsis education, screening protocols, process improvement, and
sepsis analytics has been shown to improve sepsis outcomes,11 but
change management can be resource-intensive, and changes are

 often difficult to sustain over time. This underscores the potential
for intelligent and prompt sepsis decision support at the point of
care. This impetus has led to the development of several systems
that use automated, computerized surveillance for detecting sep-
sis.12–19 However, to date, these clinical decision support (CDS) sys-
tems either lack sensitivity for sepsis detection or have poor
specificity, adding to provider alert fatigue and disuse of the CDS
system.12,13,15,17,19,20 As a result, electronic surveillance systems
have
not
managed
to
dramatically
improve
sepsis
mortal-
ity.16,17,19,20 With an aim to fill the void for highly sensitive and spe-
cific automated sepsis surveillance and point-of-care CDS, we
developed and implemented a CDS system, then evaluated its test
characteristics and the resultant sepsis-related outcomes.
A sepsis improvement program was implemented at Huntsville
Hospital in Huntsville, Alabama, using a triad of techniques: (1)
change management, (2) an electronic surveillance system, created
using detailed rules to achieve high sensitivity and specificity, and
(3) decision support delivered at the point of care using a mobile ap-
plication. Sepsis algorithms based on the Institute for Healthcare
Improvement’s (IHI) Surviving Sepsis Guidelines, in addition to hun-
dreds of CDS rules tailored to the prevalence of comorbid medical
conditions in the study population that could mimic or explain sep-
sis symptoms, were implemented for automated sepsis screening.
The investigators hypothesized that this program would result in a
significant reduction of sepsis-related mortality.
METHODS
The study site was Huntsville Hospital, a tertiary care teaching hos-
pital in Huntsville, Alabama. Huntsville Hospital has 941 beds and
an average of 42 000 inpatient discharges annually. Sepsis surveil-
lance was initiated on two hospital floors, containing two respira-
tory units and one general medicine unit, comprising a total 58
inpatient beds.
The training and implementation phase of the study was from
October 1, 2013 to February 28, 2014. The implementation for the
computerized sepsis surveillance and mobile alerting system was
complete on March 6, 2014. Data from patients admitted to the two
study floors in Huntsville Hospital were collected during the study
period – March 1-December 31, 2014 (Figure 1). In addition, hospi-
tal data on baseline sepsis incidence and other health quality indica-
tors were gathered from a control period – January 1, 2011 to
September 30, 2013.
Ethics Approval
The Institutional Review Committee at Huntsville Hospital deemed
this study exempt, because it was a part of hospital quality improve-
ment initiative to reduce sepsis-related mortality. All selected patient
data were accessible only to authorized personnel and stored using
institutionally recommended security protocols.
Study Design
This was a single center, quasi-experimental study, with pre- and
post-test analysis comparing patients admitted to two hospital floors
on which a sepsis improvement program was implemented. The pri-
mary endpoint for the study was a comparison of sepsis-related mor-
tality before and after the implementation of the sepsis improvement
program. The sepsis improvement program consisted of a combina-
tion of sepsis education, process improvement through change man-
agement, and an electronic CDS system. The CDS system conducted
real-time surveillance of electronic medical record (EMR) data and
delivered alerts to nursing staff’s mobile devices at the point of care.
Evidence-based advice was also delivered to nursing staff for all
patients that screened as positive for sepsis. The advice included the
3- and 6-h bundles recommended by the Society of Critical Care’s
Surviving Sepsis Campaign.4
In a secondary analysis, the investigators also compared 30-day
readmission and average length of hospital stay in the control and
study group populations. Additionally, as a sub-analysis, the validity
of sepsis alerts in comparison to the gold standard for diagnoses of
sepsis of chart review was assessed.
Implementation Training and Change Management
The training and implementation period was utilized for change
management, to create sepsis protocols and order sets, to establish
unit teams, and to educate unit staff about sepsis and the use of the
electronic sepsis alerting system. The governance process for estab-
lishing sepsis protocols was handled by the creation of nursing ward
teams, a Sepsis Steering Committee, and a Physician Steering
Committee. These teams’ duties included:
•
Creating sepsis order sets based on the Society for Critical Care’s
Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines.
•
Defining sepsis protocols for testing, communication, and fol-
low-up.
•
Establishing nursing protocols for lactate testing at the point of
care for positive sepsis screening alerts.
•
Creating electronic nursing documentation within the hospital
EMR system that contained key discrete data elements necessary
for sepsis screening algorithms.
•
Educating hospital staff about sepsis and the sepsis screening
protocols, including both formal, didactic sessions as well as on-
going instruction and feedback.
•
Educating staff about the use of the electronic sepsis screening
program.
•
Facilitating progress across the unit teams.
•
Creating excitement, awareness, and adoption of the sepsis pro-
gram amongst the diverse clinical staff.
•
Leading the overall sepsis initiative at the hospital.
Implementation of Electronic Sepsis Surveillance and
Alerting System
Sepsis Alerting Algorithms
An electronic sepsis surveillance and alerting system that assessed pa-
tient demographics, vital signs, medications, lab values, and discrete
documentation elements from nursing documentation, including
medical problems, infectious diagnoses, as well as signs and symp-
toms of infection, was put in place in the study wards (Figure 2).
During the system’s implementation period, the nursing documenta-
tion within the hospital’s EMR was evaluated and adjusted to ensure
that appropriate discrete clinical elements would be documented for
use by the system’s rules engine. Discrete clinical data from the nurs-
ing documentation forms and other data were exported to an exter-
nal rules engine using real-time Health Level Seven International
interfaces.
The sepsis surveillance algorithms were created based on direc-
tives issued by the Office of National Coordinator and the Health
Information and Management Systems Society Clinical Decision
Support Workgroup and Task Force guidelines on CDS implementa-
tion.21 The algorithms were also reviewed by subject matter experts
with clinical experience in sepsis and clinical informatics. Through

 iterative development, decision support algorithms were built to diag-
nose sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock, taking into account co-
morbid acute and chronic diseases and associated parameters that can
lead to misclassification errors in sepsis diagnosis. For example, creat-
inine was assessed differently for patients with renal disease; serum
lactate, bilirubin, and platelet count results were assessed differently
for patients with end-stage liver disease; and heart rate for patients on
beta blockers had a different alerting threshold. The investigators re-
viewed all lab and vital sign parameter values after examining all the
alerts that occurred during the implementation period, and adjusted
these values for the specific patient population in the study screening
units. The two physician investigators (S.M., S.R.C.) reviewed cases
with comorbidities and adjusted the clinical parameters based on a
combination of data analysis, literature review, and expert consensus.
For patients that screened as positive for sepsis, therapeutic advice
was delivered, based on evidence-based best practice recommenda-
tions, including, but not limited to, the Society of Critical Care
Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines for sepsis.22–24 Further details
on the overview of the alerting system and treatment protocols can be
found in the Supplementary Appendix.
Real-time electronic sepsis surveillance was initiated in the two
study medical units in March 2014. All patients admitted to the
participating units were automatically enrolled for electronic sepsis
screening. Nurses received alert notifications on mobile and desktop
computer devices on a secured hospital network. The sepsis CDS
system communicated important patient-specific information to
nursing staff using four types of alerts: (1) informational prompts,
like isolated tachycardia, isolated hypothermia, etc.; (2) diagnostic
alerts that informed nurses about new positive sepsis screening re-
sults or signs of worsening sepsis in patients who previously
screened as positive for sepsis; (3) advice alerts containing narratives
for evidence-based care for sepsis, such as intravenous fluids, antibi-
otics, lactate testing, and recommended site-specific sepsis order
sets, communication protocols, etc. (the advice mirrored and sup-
ported the protocols created during the change management effort);
and (4) reminder alerts, which ensured that all alerts were acknowl-
edged and that staff were complying with the recommended treat-
ment plans. Nurses were directed to contact physicians about all
patients diagnosed with sepsis.
Severe sepsis and septic shock alerts were also sent in tandem
and escalated after periodic intervals to unit charge nurses to ensure
the delivery of care and to ensure that all alerts were addressed in a
timely fashion.
Data Sources
The nursing staff were required to accept or override all positive
sepsis screening alerts. All sepsis screening alerts and respective cli-
nician responses were later utilized for calculating test characteris-
tics for the application. The diagnosis of sepsis was established
using administrative claims data for analyzing sepsis-related mor-
tality during the control and study periods.25 This method involved
utilizing
the
International
Classification
of
Diseases,
Ninth
Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes for each pa-
tient’s discharge diagnosis. Claims data have been widely used to
identify septic patients, based on any of the three explicit sepsis
ICD codes: sepsis (995.91), severe sepsis (995.92), or septic shock
(785.52). This method has been validated to be a highly specific
approach to identifying severe sepsis.26 All patients assigned at
least one of the sepsis ICD-9 codes who were admitted to the
screening units were included in the study and control sets (de-
pending on when they were admitted).
Data were collected retrospectively for all patients who were ad-
mitted to either of the two screening floors of the hospital from
March 1-December 31, 2014, for the study period, and from
January 1, 2011 to September 30, 2013, for the control period.
The investigators excluded cases that could not be impacted by
the sepsis surveillance system from the analysis, including patients
admitted directly to the ICU or who had received care in the ICU be-
fore being admitted to the sepsis study units. These patients were ex-
cluded from the study because the bulk of their sepsis care was
administered before their enrollment in the sepsis screening pro-
gram. Patients who had documentation or designation to intention-
ally receive limited care (eg, comfort measures only) were also
excluded from both periods of the analysis.
Test Characteristics
The investigators evaluated patients screened using the surveillance
program and alerts from April 1-June 30, 2014 to analyze the rules
driving the sepsis-related alerts based on parameters sent from the
surveillance engine. Sepsis diagnosis was compared against gold-
standard chart review to calculate the positive predictive value, sen-
sitivity, and specificity of the interventions.

 In order to confirm the sepsis diagnosis for calculating sensitivity
and specificity, two physicians did a comprehensive chart review on
all patients that received care in the study units from April-June 2014.
Case Definitions
Case definitions for systemic inflammatory response (SIRS), sepsis,
and severe sepsis were based on the Society of Critical Care Surviving
Sepsis Campaign Guidelines’ evidence-based recommendation.22–
24,27 Sepsis was defined as the presence of two or more SIRS criteria
secondary to infection. Severe sepsis was deemed present when there
was evidence of organ dysfunction due to sepsis. Septic shock was de-
fined as hypotension that was persistent after an initial fluid chal-
lenge in patients with sepsis or a serum lactate level of >4 mmol/L
that was deemed to be elevated as a result of sepsis.
“Limited care” was defined as an instance in which appropriate
sepsis care was intentionally withheld. Limited care did not include
do not resuscitate/do not intubate (DNR/DNI) status unless it re-
sulted in intentional withholding of care. Limited care did not in-
clude withdrawal of care after care had been provided and found to
be futile because the patient had end-stage sepsis.
We used the Elixhauser scoring system28,29 to evaluate comor-
bidities prevalent in the control and study populations. Patients
were classified into one of two groups: the comorbidity present
group or the comorbidity absent. We calculated a modified
Elixhauser score by adding assigned points for each patient condi-
tion, excluding conditions with a negative Elixhauser score. All pa-
tients that had a modified Elixhauser score of greater than zero were
included in the comorbidity present group.
The two physician investigators reviewed all patient records from
April-June 2014 to diagnose the presence and severity of sepsis for
positive screenings, in order to calculate alert test characteristics. All
disagreements were reviewed and adjudicated. To assess reviewer
agreement on the sepsis diagnosis, a subset of cases was reviewed by
an independent physician with expertise in sepsis diagnosis and man-
agement. A Kappa statistic was calculated to assess inter-rater agree-
ment
for
sepsis
diagnosis
between
the
two
initial
physician
investigators and the independent physician reviewer.30
In a secondary analysis, the investigators also compared 30-day
readmission rates and patients’ average length of stay in the hospital.
Additionally, the validity of sepsis alerts in comparison to gold-stan-
dard chart review for diagnoses of sepsis was assessed.
Analysis
The primary outcome of interest was sepsis-related mortality on the
floors where screening was performed using the electronic sepsis sur-
veillance system, comparing the control and study periods.
ICD-9 codes from insurance claims were retrospectively evalu-
ated to confirm each patient’s sepsis diagnosis. All patients who had
been assigned one of the three ICD-9 codes (sepsis, septicemia, and
septic shock) were deemed positive for sepsis. This method was used
for all patients admitted during the control and study periods.
RESULTS
Site Characteristics
The average patient age for the study group population was 63 years,
and 49% of the study participants were female. No significant differ-
ences in age or sex were noted in the control population (Table 1).
Key Findings 
• First study to use a combination of change 
management, computerized surveillance, 
and mobile based point of care alerting. 
• 53% decrease in sepsis mortality on 
hospital units where sepsis initiative was 
implemented. 
• Alert sensitivity 95%; specificity was 82% 
compared to gold standard physician chart 
review. 
Side Bar 1 – Key Findings
We used ICD-9 codes to generate Elixhauser scores,28,29 compared
comorbidities, and noted that there was no significant difference in
the overall prevalence of comorbid conditions in the control and
study populations (Table 1).
A total of 7388 patient records were evaluated (from the com-
bined study and control periods), out of which 1634 were patients
in the sepsis screening units (1170 in the control group and 464 in
the study group, respectively). After all exclusions (ie, limited care
and ICU admissions, as described previously), 778 of the patients re-
viewed were included in the study.
The observed coding of sepsis diagnoses by ICD-9 coding in the
study units was 116 cases per 100 hospital days during the control
period, compared to 151 cases per 100 hospital days while the elec-
tronic sepsis surveillance system was in place.
The sepsis-related mortality rate was 90 deaths per 1000 cases of
sepsis during the control period, compared to 42 deaths per 1000
sepsis cases during the study phase, amounting to 53% fewer deaths
per 1000 cases after the electronic sepsis surveillance system was im-
plemented. This difference in sepsis-related mortality was statisti-
cally significant (P ¼ 0.03; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06-5.25).
Because the exclusive use of explicit ICD-9 codes for tracking sepsis
is known to have high specificity but lower sensitivity,26 we also
evaluated sepsis prevalence by including patients with three explicit
IDC-9 codes or Angus implementation codes.25,26 The mortality
rate in this cohort was 85 deaths per 1000 cases of sepsis during the
control period, and 50 deaths per 1000 cases of sepsis during the
study period, which amounted to a 41% lower mortality rate during
the post-system implementation period (P ¼ 0.06).
We noted a 43% decrease in sepsis mortality calculated based on
deaths from sepsis per day of hospital stay, with 51 sepsis-related
deaths occurring in 1004 days during the control period, and only 9
deaths occurring in 305 days during the study period. There was an

 average of 315 sepsis-related deaths annually, determined by ICD-9
code, hospital-wide (excluding the study units) during the control
period, compared to 322 deaths in 2014.
For patients with sepsis diagnosed by ICD-9 coding, a multivari-
ate logistic regression analysis after adjusting for patient age, gender,
presence of comorbidities, and hospital nursing unit showed that pa-
tients screened using the sepsis CDS system had a 2.1 times lower
risk of death (odds ratio: 0.474; 95% CI, 0.228-0.988; P ¼ .04),
compared to patients in the pre-implementation period group.
The total number of sepsis cases captured by explicit ICD-9
codes increased throughout the control and study periods both in
the study units and on all other floors hospital-wide (Figure 4).
There was no statistical difference in the year-to-year means when
comparing explicit ICD-9-coded sepsis diagnoses, including for the 10
months of study period and the year before (Table 3). Moreover, the
rate of increase in ICD-9 code capture of sepsis was the same hospital-
wide, on non-sepsis screening floors. This suggests that the sepsis initia-
tive was not the primary reason for the increase in the ICD-9 coding of
sepsis.
A secondary analysis was done for 30-day readmission rates for
all patients in the study units who had been assigned sepsis ICD-9
codes. A �30.8% change was noted in the study screening units,
with an observed readmission rate of 19.08% during the control pe-
riod and 13.21% during the study period (P ¼ 0.057; 95% CI, 0.97-
2.52).
The average length of stay in the study units for patients with
sepsis ICD-9 codes decreased from 6.72 days during the control pe-
riod to 6.68 days post-surveillance system implementation, but did
not reach statistical significance (P > 0.05).
As a sub-analysis, we also tested the accuracy of the electronic
sepsis diagnosis. We analyzed data for all patients admitted to the
study screening units over the course of 3 months and compared
those diagnosed with sepsis using the electronic system to those di-
agnosed using the gold standard of comprehensive chart review.
There was substantial agreement between the investigators and the
independent physician on the diagnosis of sepsis, with a Kappa sta-
tistic of 0.67 (95% CI, 0.41-0.92).
The electronic system had excellent accuracy for detecting sepsis
or severe sepsis, with sensitivity of 95% for sepsis cases and 82%
specificity, compared to the gold standard of physician chart review
described earlier (Table 4).
DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this study is unique in its attempt to measure the
synergistic impact of a triad of change management with evidence-
based guideline education, electronic surveillance, and advanced mo-
bile-based point-of-care alerting on sepsis outcomes. This study is
also an important addition to the existing body of knowledge on sep-
sis CDS systems because of its high sensitivity and specificity for real-
time surveillance and point-of-care alerting. Previous CDS systems
have generated a high number of false positive alerts caused by co-
morbid medical conditions and ongoing medications. Many comor-
bid conditions alter clinical and laboratory data, thereby triggering
false positive alerts in these CDS systems.12,13,15,17,19,31,32 The sepsis
screening algorithms used in the current study were based on standard
IHI guidelines. However, these algorithms also contained additional
specifications to adjust for comorbid medical conditions and medica-
tions. We believe that the complexity of the system’s algorithms are
responsible for its high sensitivity and high specificity and are key
contributors to the impressive outcomes reported in our results.
Previous electronic surveillance systems have either had issues
with high alert fatigue, when they have been successful in detecting
sepsis (high sensitivity with low specificity), or have had modest
alert fatigue, but missed a significant number of sepsis cases (high
specificity, low sensitivity).15–20,32 Likely as a result of this, previ-
ously published electronic surveillance systems have not been shown
to have a significant impact on mortality.16,17,19,20,32 We believe
that the highly accurate alerts (sensitive and specific) in the system
designed for this study minimized alert fatigue, allowing optimal cli-
nician utilization of the system, and, when combined with the timely
detection of sepsis allowed by the system, resulted in the positive
outcome of significantly reduced sepsis mortality in the study
population.

 Data analysis also showed a relative increase in the number of
ICD-9-code-based sepsis diagnoses during the study period. It can
be argued that this was due to an increased awareness of sepsis, in-
creased documentation, and, therefore, increased ICD-9 coding of
sepsis. This may indeed account for the modest increase in the im-
provement in sepsis coding seen in this study, but, more likely, there
was greater impact from the sepsis documentation improvement ini-
tiative that started years prior to the study period. The documenta-
tion initiative implemented hospital-wide resulted in higher sepsis
rates throughout the hospital, including the sepsis study units. We
noted that there was a steady increase in the number of sepsis cases
from 2011, and there was no significant change in the number of
cases from the year before this sepsis program was implemented
(2013–2014).
Regardless of the reason for the increase in cases assigned ICD-9
codes for sepsis, the increase complicates the mortality assessment;
capturing more sepsis cases may artificially seem to improve out-
comes when mortality is assessed as deaths per case of sepsis by
ICD-9 code criteria. Because the capture rate went up from the con-
trol period to the study period, the 53% mortality reduction is an
overestimation of the true mortality reduction.
When assessed using the number of ICD-9-code-identified sepsis
deaths per number of total patient hospital stay days, the mortality
rate went down by 43%. Because the improvement in ICD-9 code
capture of sepsis cases can be expected to increase the number of
sepsis cases in the study population, it would also be expected to in-
crease the documentation and capture of sepsis-related deaths.
Thus, calculating the number of deaths from sepsis per hospital stay
days possibly underestimates the true impact of our interventions on
sepsis-related mortality rates. The true reduction in sepsis-related
mortality as a result of our interventions was likely between 43
and 53%.
We employed another method to evaluate the reduction in sep-
sis-related mortality observed in this study. In this method, patients
were considered to be sepsis-positive if they met Angus implementa-
tion criteria or had an ICD-9 code for sepsis. This method also re-
vealed a 41% lower mortality rate in the study group. This
reduction is slightly lower than our other estimates, because the
Angus implementation criteria method had a significantly lower spe-
cificity,26 and thereby also captured non-sepsis cases that were not
impacted by the sepsis system. Nevertheless, it serves as another ap-
propriate check to confirm that the system reduced mortality.
Sepsis mortality was reduced in the study group, based on four
assessments: (1) measuring sepsis prevalence and mortality using
ICD-9 codes for sepsis; (2) calculating sepsis mortality over a period
of time; (3) calculating sepsis prevalence and mortality using Angus
implementation criteria; and (4) measuring sepsis mortality after ad-
justing for patient-level parameters.

aSepsis prevalence calculated by chart review, not by ICD-9 coding. The
calculated sepsis prevalence is for the 3-month duration that patients spent in
the sepsis study units. Sepsis prevalence may be different hospital-wide and in
the total Huntsville patient population. The true positive predictive value and
negative predictive value may also be different, because they are based on true
sepsis prevalence and not ICD-9 code proxy for sepsis.

 In addition, further analysis showed that sepsis mortality did not
improve on units that did not implement our electronic surveillance
and alerting system. We thus infer that the sepsis initiative was the
primary driver of the improvement in sepsis-related mortality in the
study population.
This sepsis initiative did not include any additional hospital dis-
charge planning or education. We postulate that the improvement in
30-day readmission rates for sepsis patients observed in this study
was due to an expedient sepsis diagnosis and improved care, factors
that have been well-established to decrease morbidity, length of hos-
pital stay, and readmission rates in multiple studies.5,6,18,33
There is often an inverse relationship between length of hospital
stay and risk of readmission within 30 days in initiatives that impact
these metrics. However, patients’ length of hospital stay did not in-
crease despite a reduction in the 30-day readmission rate in this
study. It can be inferred that the impact on 30-day readmission is
due to improvement of the care process and not an increased length
of stay in the hospital, which could artificially reduce the 30-day
readmission rate.
The trend we saw toward improvement in patients’ average
length of hospital stay post-implementation of the sepsis surveillance
and alerting system did not achieve statistical significance. We hy-
pothesize that a hospital-wide implementation of the electronic sep-
sis surveillance and alerting system would result in standardized
sepsis screening and early detection, improved sepsis guideline ad-
herence, and a substantially bigger sample size to test the system
with, which are known determinants for significant improvement in
length of hospital stay for sepsis patients. Levy et al.6 and Jones
et al.,34 suggest that all sepsis quality characteristics, including mor-
tality, 30-day readmission rate, and average length of hospital stay
and ICU stay are significantly improved with improved sepsis guide-
line adherence for bundle compliance. Because the primary focus of
our program was to improve sepsis care by following IHI bundle
compliance, we hypothesize that these same quality indicators will
all improve.
The Third International Consensus Definitions Task Force re-
cently updated its definitions of sepsis.35 We welcome the new defi-
nitions, acknowledge the need to simplify the process of diagnosing
of sepsis, and second the task force’s nod to the continued usefulness
of SIRS criteria for the identification of infection. However, the task
force’s comment about the SIRS criteria’s “poor discriminant valid-
ity”35 may not hold true for intelligent CDS systems, including the
one evaluated in this study. As previously described in this article,
the CDS system designed for this study leveraged EHR data to ac-
count for multiple patient comorbidities that may otherwise trigger
false positive alerts for patients without sepsis.
It has been established that early detection and treatment of sep-
sis significantly decreases sepsis-related mortality.3–7 However, there
remains a paucity of evidence regarding which definition of sepsis
(ie, Sepsis-2 or Sepsis-3) detects sepsis earlier. Thus, until the new
sepsis definition has been vetted by the clinical community and vali-
dated in multiple patient populations and hospital settings, we rec-
ommend a hybrid approach, comprising a combination of the
existing SIRS and severe sepsis criteria that have been carefully
weighed and adjusted based on patient comorbidities and medica-
tions, augmented with the new simplified quick Sequential Organ
Failure Assessment (qSOFA) and SOFA scoring. We intend to up-
date our algorithms with the new hybrid criteria and revalidate the
findings in a separate study. Nonetheless, because our methods for
developing and implementing the sepsis CDS system are based on
established informatics standards,21 we argue that the methods em-
ployed in this study can be utilized to replicate equally impressive re-
sults using newer sepsis definitions.
Our study has several limitations. The sample size, particularly
for the study period, is relatively modest. Moreover, this was a
quasi-experimental study comparing two different time periods. The
control population was a patient population from several years be-
fore the study period. However, we noted that the control and study
group patient populations were not different in terms of clinical set-
ting, age, gender, and comorbidities present (Table 1). Race and eth-
nicity information was missing for a large number of patients and
thus was not utilized in the multivariate analysis. It is possible that
secular trends and improvements in medical knowledge, staff train-
ing, guideline adherence, and quality of care over time may have
influenced the quality of sepsis care in this study and, hence, may
have improved outcomes. However, Huntsville Hospital did not
have an established Rapid Response Team during the control or
study period, and there was no significant change in hospital-wide
sepsis mortality during the control and study periods. Because a sim-
ilar decrease in sepsis mortality was not seen elsewhere in the hospi-
tal, we assume that the improvements in sepsis outcomes observed
on the study floors at the hospital can be attributed to the electronic
sepsis surveillance and alerting initiative. We infer that the alert sys-
tem resulted in low alarm fatigue because of its high specificity (true
negative rate). This should be re-evaluated in a mixed-methods anal-
ysis involving the system end users. We did not study guideline ad-
herence and bundle compliance for electronically screened sepsis
patients and impact of these factors on sepsis quality metrics, but in-
tend to explore this in follow-up studies. Additionally, another po-
tential limitation that could impact the study is that administrative
data (ie, ICD-9 codes) used to diagnose sepsis in our study are
known to have low sensitivity.25,26 We were, however, consistent in
employing this method of identifying septic patients during the con-
trol and study periods.
CONCLUSION
An electronic surveillance and alerting system for sepsis can achieve
both high sensitivity and high specificity with a design focused on
building many patient-specific detection rules. We observed a signif-
icant improvement in sepsis-related quality metrics, including de-
creased mortality and decreased 30-day readmissions, using a triad
of change management, electronic surveillance with highly sensitive
and specific alerting rules, and decision support delivered to the
point of care. These results should be externally validated in larger
and differing patient populations.
