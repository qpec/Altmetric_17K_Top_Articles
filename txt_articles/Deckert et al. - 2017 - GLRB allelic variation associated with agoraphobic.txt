 Abstract  
The molecular genetics of panic disorder (PD) with and without agoraphobia (AG) are 
still largely unknown and progress is hampered by small sample sizes. We therefore 
performed a genome-wide association study with a dimensional, PD/AG - related anxiety 
phenotype based on the Agoraphobia Cognition Questionnaire (ACQ) in a sample of 1,370 
healthy German volunteers of the CRC TRR58 MEGA study wave 1. A genome-wide 
significant association was found between ACQ and single non-coding nucleotide variants of 
the GLRB gene (rs78726293, p=3.3x10-8; rs191260602, p=3.9x10-8). We followed up on this 
finding in a larger dimensional ACQ sample (N=2,547) and in independent samples with a 
dichotomous AG phenotype based on the Symptoms Checklist (SCL-90; N=3,845) and a case-
control sample with the categorical phenotype PD/AG (Ncombined =1,012) obtaining highly 
significant p-values also for GLRB single nucleotide variants rs17035816 (p=3.8x10-4) and 
rs7688285 (p=7.6x10-5). GLRB gene expression was found to be modulated by rs7688285 in 
brain tissue as well as cell culture. Analyses of intermediate PD/AG phenotypes 
demonstrated increased startle reflex and increased fear network as well as general sensory 
activation by GLRB risk gene variants rs78726293, rs191260602, rs17035816 and rs7688285. 
Partial Glrb knockout-mice demonstrated an agoraphobic phenotype. In conjunction with 
the clinical observation that rare coding GLRB gene mutations are associated with the 
neurological disorder hyperekplexia characterized by a generalized startle reaction and 
agoraphobic behavior, our data provide evidence that non-coding, though functional GLRB 
gene polymorphisms may predispose to PD by increasing startle response and agoraphobic 
cognitions. 
 
 Introduction  
Panic disorder (PD) with a life-time prevalence of 2-3 percent, causing a huge burden 
of disease 1, is characterized by sudden panic attacks, anticipatory anxiety of the next panic 
attack and frequently accompanied by agoraphobia (AG) 2. AG is a clinical condition 
characterized by abnormal open space behavior 3 and, importantly, distorted cognitive 
processes 4 thus reflecting a dimensional phenotype which can be assessed with the 
Agoraphobic Cognitions Questionnaire (ACQ) 5. Family studies reveal familial aggregation in 
PD and AG 6, 7 and twin studies estimated heritabilities of about 38% and 48%, with a genetic 
correlation of 0.83 between both disorders 8.  
Linkage and candidate gene association studies of PD/AG were mostly negative or 
inconsistent 9-12 due to phenotypic diversity, genetic heterogeneity and underpowered 
sample sizes. Of the candidate genes, only the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) 13-15 
gene, the neuropeptide S receptor gene (NPSR1) 16 and the monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) 
gene 17-19 have been implicated in susceptibility to PD by several independent studies and 
meta-analyses within the European population 11, 12, 20, 21. 
Two genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on PD/AG 22-25 have been published. In 
contrast to the more advanced GWAS e.g. in schizophrenia 26, GWAS in PD are characterized 
by small sample sizes (hundreds versus thousands). However, the TMEM132D gene 
identified in a GWAS was confirmed in the European population in an independent meta-
analysis 11. An alternative approach utilized were GWAS studies on dimensional traits 
(neuroticism and phobic anxiety) 27-29, which supported a locus on chromosome 1, but so far 
showed inconclusive results with regard to individual genes. Recently, an approach studying 
anxiety disorders combined and quantitative phenotypic scores was applied providing 
genome-wide evidence for a non-coding RNA locus on chromosome 3q12.3 and the 
CAMKMT (calmodulin-lysine N-methyltransferase) gene on chromosome 2p21 30, 31. 
Assuming a dimension from agoraphobic cognitions to full PD/AG, we (1) conducted a 
GWAS on a dimensional anxiety phenotype (ACQ) in a sample of 1,370 healthy German 
volunteers to generate hypotheses for further investigations. We then (2) evaluated the 
GLRB locus in a larger dimensional ACQ sample, comprising 2,547 healthy volunteers. Next, 
we validated our findings (3) in a Dutch control sample (N=3,845) with a dichotomous 
 measure of AG symptoms [SCL-90] and (4) assessed the relevance of the association for the 
categorical phenotype PD/AG by analyzing 506 case-control pairs. To probe molecular 
consequences of GLRB genetic variation, we (5) measured mRNA expression in vitro and post 
mortem. As single nucleotide mutations in GLRB underlie hyperekplexia 2 (OMIN #614619), 
characterized by exaggerated startle response, we examined the effect of the identified 
GLRB risk polymorphisms on startle habituation (6), potentiation (7), and generalization (8). 
This was complemented by (9) fMRI analysis of fear network and general sensory activation. 
Finally (10), we performed an analysis of agoraphobic behavior in mice with a partial Glrb 
knock-out. 
 
 
 
 Materials and Methods 
GLRB locus, agoraphobic cognitions and PD/AG 
Samples 
To identify loci associated with agoraphobic traits as defined by the ACQ 5(German 
version 32), we examined 1,370 healthy German volunteers by conducting a GWAS and then 
evaluated the genome-wide significant locus in a larger sample comprising 2,547 German 
healthy controls (MEGA study waves 1 and 2 33, 34). We validated the locus in 3,845 
independent Dutch participants of the Nijmegen Biomedical Study (NBS 35) for a 
dichotomous SCL-90 36, 37 (Dutch version 38) based agoraphobic cognitions phenotype and at 
the categorical level by comparing 506 PD patients (Panic-Net study waves 1 and 2 16, 19, 21, 39, 
40) with 506 matched controls from MEGA study waves 1 and 2. In all but the NBS studies, 
PD/AG patients and probands with severe psychiatric, neurological, or somatic disorders as 
well as drug and alcohol abuse were excluded. Only individuals with written informed 
consent were enrolled, which complied with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved 
by the respective local Ethics Committee. For a demographic overview see supplementary 
table 1. 
Genotyping  
Participants of the MEGA wave 1 sample were genotyped on Illumina’s Human-
Hap550v3 BeadChips using the Infinium II assay (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) at the 
Department of Genomics, Life & Brain Center, University of Bonn, Germany. Quality control 
procedures were performed as described previously 41 with slightly modified exclusion 
criteria (SNPs and subjects with call rates (CR) ≤99%; minor allele frequency (MAF) ≤1%; 
failing Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) (p<10-5); principal component analysis (PCA) > 
4fold SD of the first three principal components. To increase genomic coverage, imputation 
was conducted using MACH v1.0.18.c/ MINIMACH v2013-07-17 42, 43 and the 1000 Genomes 
reference data set 44. Post-imputation QC includes: SNPs and subjects CR≥95%, MAF≥1%, 
failing HWE (p≥10-5), imputation quality score (IQS) <0.3, population stratification, gender 
and unreported relatedness check. The GWAS was free from genomic inflation in QQ-plots 
(λ=1.000933) as shown in supplementary figure 1. 
 NBS was genotyped using the Illumina Human Omniexpress-12 and -24 chip. The pre-
imputation QC steps applied to the NBS cohort include: SNP MAF>1%, HWE>10-4, SNP yield 
and individual CR>95%. Imputation was done using IMPUTE v2.3.0 following the BBMRI-NL 
pipeline (http://www.bbmriwiki.nl/wiki/Impute2Pipeline) using the 1000 genomes phase 1 
v3 and GoNL reference panels combined. Post-imputation QC comprised a gender check, 
unreported relatedness between participants and population stratification.  
For fine mapping we captured GLRB and its flanking regions (+40/-10 kb 
upstream/downstream) 
by 
21 
tagSNPs 
derived 
from 
dbSNP 
European 
data 
(http://manticore.niehs.nih.gov/snpinfo/snptag.htm). Genotyping was performed using the 
Sequenom MassArray® system (Sequenom, San Diego, CA, USA; for Primer sequences see 
supplementary table 2) and for rs17035628 using a “KASP on demand” assay (LGC Genomics, 
Hertfordshire, UK) as recommended by the manufacturers. After QC, the final dataset 
included 20 (two GWAS SNPs + 18 tagSNPs) markers with a MAF≥1%, CR≥90% and HWE 
(controls only) p≥0.01; rs17035590, rs17035814 and rs17035628 had to be excluded.  
For details on statistical and power analysis see supplementary methods. 
Functional assessment: Bioinformatic, post mortem and cell system expression analyses 
To detect functional variation on expression of GLRB and neighbor genes, we 
analyzed 
our 
strongly 
associated 
variants, 
using 
the 
GTEx 
eQTL 
database 
(http://www.gtexportal.org/home). 
For expression analysis of the promotor SNP rs7688285, post-mortem brain samples 
of 76 individuals (mean age 48.6±12.8) were obtained from the Medical Research Council 
(MRC) Sudden Death Brain and Tissue Bank, Edinburgh. Detailed information on the sample 
and mRNA quantification are described elsewhere 45. Allele-specific changes of rs7688285 on 
mRNA expression were calculated by linear regression with genotype and sample RIN as 
independent and expression values as dependent variable according to a dominant model. 
 For expression analysis in a heterologous cell system, 20 bp flanking rs7688285 up- 
and downstream were subcloned into pGL4.23 vector for both alleles, allowing expression of 
firefly luciferase under the control of a minimal promotor. For details see supplementary 
methods.  
 Functional assessment: Startle Reflex  
Samples 
Participants of MEGA and PanicNet waves 1, who had taken part in various 
assessments of defensive behavior 33, 46, 47, were studied regarding the effect of GLRB 
variation on startle reflex modulation. Individuals carrying at least one GLRB risk allele (i.e., 
those highly significantly associated with either ACQ or PD, namely: rs78726293 (A allele), 
rs191260602 (G allele), rs17035816 (G allele) or rs7688285 (A allele) were classified as “risk 
allele carriers”. Accordingly, of 101 healthy volunteers who participated in an emotion-
potentiated startle paradigm 24, of 76 healthy volunteers who participated in a context 
conditioning paradigm 23, and of 115 PD/AG patients who participated in a behavioral 
avoidance test (BAT) 52 were risk allele carriers. For sample characteristics and genotype 
counts see supplementary table 3.  
Paradigms 
Startle reactivity was investigated in three paradigms selected to allow for 
hierarchical analysis of startle reactivity with increasing complexity, focusing on a) startle 
habituation during an emotion-potentiated startle paradigm 33, b) startle potentiation 
triggered by a threatening environment during the BAT 47, and c) startle generalization 
during context-conditioning 46. For a detailed description on startle methodology, paradigms 
and statistical analyses see supplementary methods. 
Functional assessment: Fear Network  
Sample 
Healthy volunteers from two studies (Study 1: N=72, 48; Study 2: N=38) with identical 
experimental design during a cue fear conditioning paradigm were included. All participants 
were right-handed with normal or corrected-to-normal vision. All participants were recruited 
from the MEGA study wave 2. Participants were grouped into risk and no-risk allele carriers 
as described above (risk: N=33). For sample characteristics see supplementary table 3. 
Experimental Design 
 Two visual stimuli served as conditioned stimuli (CSs) and three electro-tactile stimuli 
as US. The CS+ was always, and the CS- never was followed by the US while skin conductance 
responses (SCRs), fear ratings and fMRI data, were acquired (see 48, 49).  
All behavioral data (SCR, ratings) were analyzed using SPSS 22 for Windows (IBM 
Corp., Armonk, New York) using repeated measures analyses for CS type per experimental 
phase (first half acquisition, second half acquisition, extinction). Rating values after fear 
acquisition were corrected for pre-acquisition scores. An α-level of p<.05 was considered 
significant (unless otherwise stated), and Greenhouse-Geisser corrected degrees of freedom 
were used when appropriate. For a detailed description on fMRI data acquisition, 
preprocessing and statistical analyses see supplementary methods. 
Agoraphobic behavior in heterozygous Glrb knockout mice 
Animals 
The spastic mouse 50, 51 has an insertion of a LINE1 element into intron 5, resulting in 
lower expression levels of the full-length glycine receptor beta (Glrbspa). Heterozygous 
Glrb+/spa do not show the spastic phenotype. All experiments were done with adult C57BL/6J 
and C57BL/6J Glrb+/spa mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME, US) in accordance with 
European Union guidelines, as approved by our institutional animal care and utilization 
committee. The experiments were authorized under reference number 55.2-2531.01-95/13. 
For details on genotyping, membrane preparation, mRNA quantification, Western Blot and 
immunostaining see supplementary methods. 
Open field test 
Wild-type and heterozygous Glrb+/spa mice were tested individually for anxiety like 
behaviour. They were placed in a 48x48cm square box, illuminated with ~40lux. Animals 
were monitored for 10 or 30 min each and tracked with the Video Mot Software (TSE, 
Germany). For analysis, the box was divided into fields of interest: centre of the arena 
(24x24 cm) versus the periphery. The first 5 min were analysed counting entries and time 
spent in centre 52. Differences between genotypes were tested using a two-way ANOVA with 
Bonferroni posttest or an unpaired t-test. 
 
 
 Results 
GLRB locus, agoraphobic cognitions and PD/AG 
After quality control of post-imputational data, altogether 1,370 healthy volunteers 
from MEGA wave 1 with information of 7,071,105 autosomal markers were available for 
analysis. GWAS analysis on ACQ yielded 122 markers with p<1x10-5 (figure 1a, 
supplementary table 4) distributed over 22 genomic regions (supplementary table 5). On 
chromosome 4, genome-wide significance was reached for the imputed SNPs rs78726293 
(p=3.3x10-8; IQS= 0.58) and rs191260602 (p=3.9x10-8; IQS= 0.68), both located in an intronic 
region of the glycine receptor beta (GLRB) gene. This locus was supported by a nearly 
genome-wide signal, rs115177500 (p=8.3x10-8), upstream of GLRB, and by further 26 
strongly associated variants (p<1x10-4) within a window of 400 Kb around this gene (figure 
1b). 
Both genome-wide significant polymorphisms rs78726293 and rs191260602 and 
further 18 SNPs fully tagging GLRB were genotyped and analyzed in a larger ACQ sample 
(MEGA waves 1 and 2; N=2,547; table 1). The genome-wide significant SNPs, rs78726293 and 
rs191260602, and in addition rs17035816 were strongly associated in the larger sample 
(prs78726293=4.3x10-4; prs191260602=8.8x10-5; prs17035816=3.8x10-4), always with the minor allele 
increasing ACQ sum scores (table 1). 
All 20 examined SNPs were additionally analyzed for association with a SCL-90 based 
dichotomous agoraphobia phenotype in the Nijmegen Biomedical Study (NBS) comprising 
3,845 healthy participants. The minor allele of a further SNP rs7688285, was strongly 
associated with increased risk for the SCL-90 based dichotomous agoraphobia phenotype 
(prs7688285=4.3x10-4; table 1). 
Analysis of the 20 examined SNPs for the categorical phenotype of PD/AG showed an 
overlap of significant results with both the dimensional ACQ and the dichotomous SCL-90 
based agoraphobia phenotype for both genome-wide significant SNPs rs78726293 
(prs78726293=0.033) and rs191260602 (prs191260602=0.033), as well as for rs7688285 (p=7.6x10-5). 
Again, always the minor alleles conveyed genetic risk (table 1).  
Functional assessment: Bioinformatic, post mortem and cell system expression analyses 
 None of the four strongly associated SNPs could be classified as an expression 
quantitative trait locus (eQTL) in the GTEx database. 
Genotype-specific differences of the promoter region risk variant rs7688285on mRNA 
expression levels were found in the midbrain (N=50; AA=0/AG=12/GG=38), where the minor, 
risk (A)-allele increased the mean expression of GLRB (beta=0.498; p=0.013) significantly 
(supplementary figure 2A). Neither in forebrain (N=59; AA=1/AG=16/GG=42; p=0.421) nor in 
the amygdalae (N=56; AA=2/AG=14/GG=40; p=0.487), rs7688285 affected mRNA expression. 
 In line with data of human tissue, normalized luciferase activity was significantly 
increased for the (A)-allele of rs7688285 compared to the (G)-allele (0.185±0.09 vs. 
0.155±0.09, p=0.029, N=7; supplementary figure 2B).  
Functional assessment: Startle Reflex  
Startle habituation (figure 2A) during an emotion-potentiated startle paradigm was 
significant in a healthy sample of no-risk allele carriers (N=77; t(76)=5.12, p<0.004), but not 
in risk allele carriers (N=24; t(23)=1.15, p>0.60) indicating impaired startle habituation in risk 
allele carriers (figure 2A). 
  
During a Behavioral Avoidance Test (figure 2B), PD/AG patients carrying a GLRB risk 
allele (N=52) exhibit increased startle responsivity during threat as reflected in stronger 
increases in startle potentiation from last minute of anticipation to first minute of exposure 
than no-risk allele carriers (N=63; Group x Time F(1,113)=5.22, p<0.05; η2
p=0.044). 
 
In a context conditioning paradigm (figure 2C) healthy risk-allele carriers (N=23) 
exhibited as well overall stronger startle potentiation during acquisition compared to no-risk 
allele carriers (N=63; F(1,74)=4.39, p=0.040, η2
p=0.056). The high risk group revealed 
potentiated startle in both the threat (CTX+) and the safety context (CTX-) without difference 
between the two (t(22)=0.11, p=0.915), in contrast to the no-risk group that featured 
potentiated startle in the CTX+ only (t(52)=2.75, p=0.008). Accordingly, startle potentiation 
in the CTX- was significantly higher for risk-allele carriers compared to the no-risk group 
(t(74)=2.50, p=0.015). Again pointing to impaired startle habituation, we found that startle 
responses in CTX- declined across acquisition in the no-risk group (Acquisition1 vs. 
Acquisition2: t(52)=2.79, p=0.007), but not in the risk group (t(22)=0.24, p=0.811). Finally, we 
observed no group differences during extinction, but the high risk group showed a stronger 
 sensitization of startle magnitudes in CTX+ during test, i.e. spontaneous recovery (Context x 
Group interaction: F(1,74)=5.77, p=.019, η2
p=0.072). The resulting significantly increased 
startle responses in CTX+ in the risk compared to the no-risk group (t(74)=2.78, p=0.007) 
further emphasizes increased responsivity of the startle system in the risk group.  
Functional assessment: Fear Network  
During late cue conditioning, GLRB risk-allele carriers showed significantly stronger 
CS+-reactivity in several regions of interest of the fear network (thalamus, 
putamen/pallidum at p(FEW-corrected); figure 3A, B and supplementary table 6) as well as 
stronger CS+-reactivity in skin conductance responses (SCRs) [stimulus x group interaction: 
F(1,105)=3.56, one-sided p=0.031, η2=0.03, figure 3F].  
In addition, GLRB risk-allele carriers showed significantly stronger general CS-
unspecific activation in left pre- and post-central gyrus (figure 3D), the bilateral pallidum 
(figure 3E) and putamen as well as the right thalamus during both early and late acquisition 
in absence of any main effects of group on SCRs [F(1,105)=3.56, p=0.17, η2=0.02]. In 
addition, during early acquisition GLRB risk carriers also displayed generally stronger 
activation in the left amygdala (figure 3C) than no-risk allele carriers as well as stronger 
bilateral insula activation during late acquisition (supplementary table 6).  
Agoraphobic behavior in heterozygous Glrb Knockout mice  
In heterozygous Glrb+/spa mice, decreased Glrb expression levels were observed both 
at the mRNA and protein level, in particular in thalamus and hippocampus (supplementary 
figure 3). Interestingly, these regions were found to be differentially activated as a function 
of GLRB genotype in the human fear conditioning paradigm (see above). Heterozygous 
Glrb+/spa mice showed a significantly enhanced agoraphobic behavior demonstrated by less 
time spent in the center of the open field (+/+ 0.52±0.05 min; +/spa 0.4±0.03 min). Both 
groups of animals, however, did not differ in distance traveled and number of entries into 
the field (figure 4).  
 
 
 Discussion 
Beyond classical diagnostic phenotypes, the specification of functional dimensions of 
behavior as done in the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) approach 53 aims at obtaining 
insights into the biological basis of mental illness. In this context, negative valence and 
arousal systems 54 are relevant to PD/AG. The development of PD/AG in early adulthood is 
preceded by increased scores on dimensional anxiety phenotypes with negative valence 
such as anxiety sensitivity 55 and agoraphobic cognitions 56 which are thus relevant proxies 
for PD/AG.  
To start with, we therefore performed a hypothesis-generating GWAS using the ACQ 
in a German cohort (MEGA wave 1) which suggested that allelic variation in GLRB on 
chromosome 4q31-34 is associated with quantitative ACQ scores. Results from a larger 
sample (MEGA waves 1 and 2) and two independent sample (NBS, PanicNet waves 1 and 2) 
supported this finding and extended it to a dichotomous agoraphobia phenotype as well as 
the categorical phenotype PD/AG. This chromosomal locus (4q31-34) had previously been 
proposed as genome-wide linkage locus for anxiety disorders 57. In the linkage scan, the 
most significant marker (D4S413) is located a mere 384 kb from rs7688285 in GLRB. On the 
molecular level, we found the risk allele to go along with altered GLRB expression in vitro 
and post mortem.  
In the next step we asked which neural mechanisms are linked to the behavioral 
phenotypes, along the RDoC idea. The inhibitory glycine system is more ancient than the 
GABA system and thus more prevalent in evolutionary older brain regions from the spinal 
cord to the midbrain 58. The effects of glycine are mediated by heteromeric receptors 
formed by Glyalpha1-4 and Glybeta subunits 59. Single point mutations in the GLRB gene have 
recently been shown to lead to hyperekplexia 2 (OMIN #614619), a rare neurological 
disorder with Mendelian heritability 60, 61. These patients suffer from exaggerated startle 
responses to unexpected noise or tactile stimuli. On the translational level, the phenotype is 
confirmed by the spastic mouse (featuring a substantial reduction of Glrb), which is 
characterized by an increased startle reaction 62. While, in humans, startle symptoms may 
diminish with age, (agora-) phobic behavior may become a more prominent clinical feature 
63, 64. 
 Based on the startle phenotype of hyperekplectic patients and the observation that 
startle reactivity is inherited 65, 66, we investigated functional intermediate phenotypes with 
a focus on startle response as possible immediate functional consequences of GLRB genetic 
variation. Three different samples provide converging evidence that GLRB risk SNPs result in 
slower habituation, stronger potentiation and generalization of startle, although subtler as 
compared to the – potentially more deleterious –mutations in GLRB causing hyperekplexia. 
These genetic modulations of defensive reactivity of brain stem reflexes during potential 
threat, which is mediated at a subcortical level 56, 67, did not go along with concordant panic 
or anxiety ratings. Accordingly, at the level of brain function – and possibly mediated by 
GLRB expression changes in midbrain as suggested by our post-mortem data – GLRB risk 
alleles were associated not only with increased activation of the fear network, but with a 
generally stronger activation of sensory networks including the thalamus and postcentral 
gyrus as well as the motor network (precentral gyrus, pallidum and putamen) suggesting a 
general higher reactivity independent of the presence of an aversive stimulus.  
Being a very basic mechanism, the observed increased startle responses likely 
suggest a link between the Arousal system and the Negative valence system causing an 
increased likelihood to shy away from threats, i.e. increased defensive reactivity 53, 54. 
Consistent with our findings in humans and extending the known phenotype of the spastic 
mouse, we showed that partial Glrb knock-out mice exhibited avoidance of a novel open 
space, a behavior we recently confirmed to be related to agoraphobic fear in humans 3. At 
the mechanistic level, it is somewhat puzzling that the phenotype-associated rs7688285 A 
allele in fact was not found with decreased, but instead increased GLRB expression in a 
heterologous cell system as well as in post mortem samples. However, an increase in GLRB 
expression does not necessarily result in enhanced functional pentameric glycine receptors, 
which are composed of both GlyRbeta and GlyRalpha subunits. An enhanced expression of 
GlyRbeta might e.g. result in an upregulation of the 2alpha/3beta variant, to the 
disadvantage of the functionally different homomeric GlyR alpha receptor 68, and hence at 
the functional level may well have similar consequences as the mouse knockout phenotype. 
As the subunit composition of the glycine receptor changes during the life span 69, 70, this 
may be particularly relevant during neural development. As such divergences between 
mouse knockout and human genetic variants are a common though not well understood 
 phenomenon in psychiatric genetics (e.g. for the 5HTT and NPSR1 genes), mouse models for 
specific human genetic  variants, in our case of GRLB, are definitively needed. 
 
There are a few limitations of our study. First, this is a study in rather homogenous 
proband and patient samples from Germany and the neighboring Netherlands. Thus, the 
generalizability to other populations remains to be elucidated. Second, the sample sizes are 
comparably small, especially for the PD/AG sample. Hence, further replication studies and 
metaanalyses 30 e.g. in the context of a psychiatric genomics consortium framework are 
paramount. Third, the associated polymorphisms differed between samples. This may, 
however simply be due to the different phenotypes studied with greater power of the 
dimensional sample for rare polymorphisms with bigger effect sizes and greater power of 
the dichotomous sample for the more common polymorphisms. Nevertheless, the ultimate 
phenotype PD/AG demonstrated significant associations for both types of polymorphisms. 
Fourth, the human intermediate phenotype paradigms were not specifically designed to 
examine GLRB gene effects on startle responses. The proximity of the startle reaction to the 
hyperekplexia phenotype in our opinion, however, is close enough to overcome this 
shortcoming. Fifth, the definition of the risk population in the intermediate phenotype 
paradigms is based on a combination of significant alleles, as sample sizes precluded gene-
based analyses as well as investigating the effects of individual rare variants on their own. 
Reverse-phenotyping studies which are designed to specifically test a potential influence of 
specific GLRB variants on intermediate phenotypes in larger samples are needed. Deep 
sequencing of the GLRB gene for rare variants in larger samples of patients as compared to 
healthy probands with calculation of a polyallelic risk score will help to clarify this issue 71. 
In summary, our findings provide evidence that GLRB allelic variation may contribute 
not only to the rare severe neurological disorder hyperekplexia, but also to the risk of the 
comparably milder categorical anxiety disorder PD/AG by increasing startle response and, as 
a result, agoraphobic cognitions. Our data point to the startle reflex being one 
pathomechanism in PD/AG. Within the RDoC matrix, this places GLRB in the Arousal gene 
list, while adding PD/AG to the clinical entities linked to this domain. As GLRB can be 
subjected to pharmacological interventions, its modulation may comprise a novel 
therapeutic option in PD/AG.

 Figure legends 
Figure 1: Genome-wide association study (GWAS, N=1,370. (A) Manhattan plot: Horizontal 
lines show threshold for genome-wide significance (p<5×10-8 in orange) and nominal 
association (p≤0.05 in yellow). (B) Regional plot depicting genome-wide significant GLRB 
markers on chromosome 4, centered in a genomic region of 2 MB. Results are shown as –
log10 (p-value) for genotyped and imputed SNPs. The SNP showing strongest association is 
shown in purple. The color of the remaining markers reflects r2 of the strongest associated 
SNP. The recombination rate is plotted in blue. 
Figure 2: Startle reflex reactivity (means and standard error as a function of GLRB genotype 
with a risk genotype, comprising carriers of at least one risk allele of either rs78726293 (A 
allele), rs7688285 (A allele), rs191260602 (G allele), or rs17035816 (G allele). Depicted are 
(A) startle habituation during an emotion-potentiated startle paradigm (risk: N=24; no-risk: 
N=77), (B) startle potentiation in PD/AG patients during a behavioral avoidance test (risk: 
N=52; no-risk: N=63), and (C) startle generalization in contextual fear conditioning, its 
extinction and spontaneous recovery reflected in startle potentiation relative to baseline 
responses (risk: N=23; no-risk: N=53). * p<0.05; ** p<0.01; *** p<0.001. 
Figure 3: Fear Network Activation. Significant group differences at a significance threshold 
of pFWESVC between GLRB risk- allele carriers and no-risk allele carriers for CS discrimination 
in thalamic (A) and striatal regions (B) during the second half of fear acquisition. Group 
differences during early acquisition (corresponding activation pattern in late acquisition is 
not shown) in general CS-unspecific neural activation in the amygdala (C) pre-/postcentral 
areas (D) as well as striatal (putamen) areas (E) and their respective peak-voxel parameter 
estimates (for illustrative purposes). Corresponding group differences in SCR CS-
discrimination between GLRB non-risk and risk-allele carriers (F). Rc: range-corrected, Error-
bars represent s.e.m. Visualization threshold is set to p<0.01 for illustrative purposes only. 
 
Figure 4: Agoraphobic behavior in Glrb+/spa mice. (A) Open field test of +/+ and +/spa 
animals; shown are the first 5 min of the open field test. Walking pattern of representative 
+/+ and +/spa animals. (B) Time spent in the open center, distance travelled and entries, 
*p<0.05. Note that there are no differences in the distance traveled and in the number of 
entries between +/+ and +/spa mice. Number of animals analyzed were N=18 for +/spa and 
N=13 for +/+ mice.

In the ACQ sample, linear regressions for the dimensional phenotype ACQ were carried out 
assuming additive risk of the minor allele. Association results for the first and the second 
validation sample are reported as minor allele frequencies for controls and “cases” (SCL-90 
agoraphobia score ≥ 1, or panic disorder patients, respectively) along with respective 
association p-values. Chromosomal positions correspond to the GRCh38 annotation. Bold 
indicates nominal p<0.05. All p-values were rounded to the third decimal.
