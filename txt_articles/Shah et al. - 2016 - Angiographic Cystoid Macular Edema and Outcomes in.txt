Abstract
Objective—To describe morphological and visual outcomes in eyes with angiographic cystoid 
macular edema (CME) treated with ranibizumab or bevacizumab for neovascular age-related 
macular degeneration (nAMD).
Design—Prospective cohort study within a randomized clinical trial
Participants—1185 CATT study subjects
Methods—Baseline fluorescein angiogram (FA) images of all CATT study eyes were evaluated 
for CME. Grading of other characteristics on optical coherence tomography (OCT) and 
photographic images at baseline and during 2-year follow-up was completed by readers at the 
CATT Reading Centers. Three groups were created based on baseline CME and intraretinal fluid 
(IRF) status: 1) CME; 2) IRF without CME; 3) neither CME nor IRF.
Main Outcome Measures—Visual acuity (VA), and total central retinal thickness (CRT) on 
OCT at baseline, Year 1, and Year 2.
Results—Among 1131 participants having images of sufficient quality for determining CME and 
IRF at baseline, 92 (8.1%) participants had CME, 766 (67.7%) had IRF without CME, and 273 
(24.1%) had neither. At baseline, eyes with CME had: worse mean VA (letters) than eyes with 
IRF without CME and eyes with neither CME nor IRF (52 vs 60 vs 66 letters, p<0.001); higher

 mean total CRT (μ) on OCT (514 vs 472 vs 404, p<0.001); and a greater proportion with 
hemorrhage, retinal angiomatous proliferation lesions, and classic choroidal neovascularization. 
All groups showed improvement in VA at follow-up; however, the CME group started and ended 
with the worst VA amongst the three groups. CRT, while higher at baseline for the CME group, 
was similar at 1 and 2 years follow-up for all groups. More eyes with CME (65.3%) developed 
scarring during 2 years follow-up compared with eyes with IRF without CME (43.8%) and eyes 
with neither CME nor IRF (32.5%; p<0.001).
Conclusions—In CATT, eyes with CME had worse baseline and follow-up VA, although all 
groups showed similar rates of improvement in VA during 2 years follow-up. CME appears to be 
a marker for poorer visual outcomes in nAMD due to underlying baseline retinal dysfunction and 
subsequent scarring.
Introduction
Cystoid macular edema (CME) is a pathological condition associated with breakdown of the 
blood-retinal barrier and is characterized by cystic accumulation of extracellular intraretinal 
fluid in the outer plexiform and inner nuclear layers of the retina.1 On fluorescein 
angiography (FA), extensive CME takes on a characteristic “petaloid” appearance as cysts 
extending radially along the Henle nerve fiber layer fill with fluorescein and appear to 
resemble flower petals.2,3 Some common etiologies for cystoid macular edema include post-
surgical edema (Irvine-Gass syndrome), inflammatory uveitis, diabetic retinopathy, vein 
occlusions, and certain medications.2 It is not common for this pattern of leakage, 
particularly on FA, to be associated with neovascular age-related macular degeneration 
(nAMD).
The Comparison of Age-related Macular Degeneration Treatments Trials (CATT) was a 
multicenter clinical trial of the efficacy of ranibizumab and bevacizumab to treat 
neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD).4,5 In patients receiving anti-vascular 
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy, there was improvement in macular swelling 
demonstrated by improvement in vision and reduced thickness on macular ocular coherence 
tomography (OCT).4,5 Further study into the morphology of fluid and visual outcomes from 
the CATT patients showed that while all types of fluid improved with anti-VEGF 
administration, patients with intraretinal fluid (IRF) on OCT in particular had poorer visual 
acuity outcomes compared to those with subretinal fluid (SRF) or sub-retinal pigment 
epithelium (RPE) fluid.6 This finding has been substantiated by other work showing IRF to 
have a strong negative predictive value for functional improvement to anti-VEGF therapy 
and also combinations of anti-VEGF therapy and photodynamic therapy (PDT).7
The purpose of our study was to examine the presence of the angiographic cystoid macular 
edema (CME) on FA, as a subtype of IRF, and its association with visual and morphological 
outcomes within patients enrolled in CATT.

 Methods
Study population and procedures
The methodology of the CATT study has previously been described.4,5 Briefly, the CATT 
enrolled 1185 subjects, 50 years old or greater, from 43 clinical centers across the Unites 
States who had evidence of previously untreated active nAMD in the study eye. Only one 
eye per subject, the study eye, was randomized to either intravitreal ranibizumab or 
bevacizumab on a monthly or as needed (PRN) basis; at week 52, monthly treated patient 
were re-randomized to either continued monthly therapy or PRN therapy with the same 
drug. Visual acuity was tested using an electronic visual acuity tester. Color fundus 
photography (CFP), FA, and OCT were performed at baseline and during 2 years of follow-
up by certified technicians and photographers following standardized protocols.8,9
Grading of characteristics on optical coherence tomography (OCT) at baseline or during 2-
year follow-up were completed by readers at the CATT OCT Reading Center at Duke 
University. The OCT readers independently analyzed the scans for morphological 
characteristics including, but not limited to: presence of IRF, SRF, and sub-RPE fluid; the 
thickness at the foveal center of the retina; thickness of the subretinal fluid and subretinal 
tissue complex; and location of fluid in relation to the foveal center.9 Readers at the CATT 
Photograph Reading Center at the University of Pennsylvania independently examined 
stereoscopic CFPs and FAs for components of the neovascular lesion, size of choroidal 
neovascularization (CNV), presence of scar or hemorrhage, and retinal angiomatous 
proliferation (RAP) lesions.8
Baseline FA images of all CATT study eyes were evaluated for CME by one of two 
physician readers at the CATT Photograph Reading Center. CME was defined as 
honeycombed patterns of hyperfluorescence surrounding the foveal center, with features of 
pooling in well-defined foveal and parafoveal spaces. Only CME cases that were very well-
defined angiographically, with at least 3 or more “petals” apparent on FA imaging in late 
frames, confirmed by both readers were included as CME cases in our analyses (Figure 1). 
Our criteria for angiographic inclusion was fairly strict, and images with <3 petals or 
leakage that was not at the foveal center (defined as 2.75 disc diameters from the optic 
nerve10), were excluded from our study. It should be noted that for the purpose of our study, 
the term “CME” defines the angiographic presence of cysts, where as IRF describes their 
presence on OCT alone.
An institutional review board associated with each center approved the clinical trial 
protocol. All patients provided written informed consent. The study was compliant with 
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act regulations. The CATT was registered 
with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00593450).
Statistical Analysis
Subjects ineligible for the clinical trial or with ungradable images at baseline were excluded, 
leaving a total of 1131 patients available for data analysis (Figure 2). Three groups were 
formed based on baseline CME and IRF status – those with 1) CME; 2) IRF without CME; 
3) neither CME nor IRF. The comparison of baseline characteristics, visual outcomes and

 morphological outcomes were performed using analysis of variance for most continuous 
measures, and Monte Carlo exact tests for categorical measures. When the distribution of 
continuous measures was highly skewed, the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test was used. 
Linear regression models were used to adjust for the effects of previously identified risk 
factors for visual acuity and change from baseline in visual acuity at one year.11 All the 
statistical analysis were performed in SAS v9.4 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC), and a two-
sided p-value <0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.
Results
Baseline characteristics by CME and IRF status
Among the 1131 participants in the data analysis at baseline, 92 (8.1%) had CME, 766 
(67.7%) had IRF without CME, and 273 (24.1%) had neither. Baseline demographic 
features and baseline visual acuity were compared among groups (Table 1). Those with 
CME or IRF without CME were approximately 2 years older than those with neither CME 
nor IRF (p<0.001). There was no difference among groups in prevalence of hypertension, 
myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, and history of stroke/TIA. Patients with 
CME and IRF had lower rates of diabetes mellitus (16.3% and 15.7% respectively) than 
patients with neither CME nor IRF (22.7%) (p=0.04). The mean [standard error] visual 
acuity score (letters) at baseline was worst for those with CME (52.3 [1.52]) compared to 
those with IRF without CME (59.9 [0.48]) and those with neither CME nor IRF (65.8 
[0.66])(p<0.001).
CNV and OCT characteristics at baseline were also compared by CME and IRF status 
(Table 2). The proportion with subfoveal CNV was higher in the group with CME (81.5%) 
than in the other 2 groups (70.5% and 74% respectively), although the differences were not 
statistically significant (p=0.06). Eyes with neither CME nor IRF were less likely to have 
hemorrhage associated with the neovascular lesion and were less likely to have RAP lesions 
than the other groups (p<0.001). Eyes with CME had a higher percentage of classic CNV on 
FA (52.2%) compared to eyes with IRF without CME (21.1%) and eyes with neither CME 
nor IRF (16.5%; p<0.001). The mean total central retinal thickness was highest for the CME 
group (514 [15.8] microns) compared to those with IRF without CME (472[6.68] microns), 
and those with neither IRF nor CME (404 [10.4] microns, p<0.001). Eyes with CME were 
less likely to have subretinal or sub-RPE fluid than eyes in the other groups (p<0.05 for all 
comparisons).
Change in visual acuity and central retinal thickness over time by CME and IRF status
The graph in Figure 3A shows the mean change in visual acuity for each group over the 2 
year time period of study. All groups showed considerable improvement in VA after 
treatment. At week 52, the mean change in visual acuity (letters) was 8.82 in the group with 
CME, 7.23 in the group with IRF without CME, and 6.91 in the group with neither CME nor 
IRF (p=0.59). At week 104, the corresponding mean changes were 10.0, 5.89, and 6.31 
letters respectively (p=0.13). After adjustment for previously identified risk factors for 
worse visual acuity (including baseline visual acuity and age), the mean changes in visual 
acuity for the 3 groups were 7.7, 7.3, and 7.2 (p=0.97) at week 52 and 7.8, 6.0, and 6.8

 (p=0.59) at week 104. Those with CME started off with the worst visual acuity, and 
continued to have the worst visual acuity at each time point through 2 years (Figure 3B; 
p<0.001 at each point). At week 52, the mean visual acuity (letters) was 61.2 in the group 
with CME, 67.2 letters in the group with IRF without CME, and 72.7 in the group with 
neither CME nor IRF (p<0.001). At week 104, the corresponding means were 62.7, 66.1, 
and 72.4 letters, respectively (p<0.001). After adjustment for previously identified risk 
factors for worse visual acuity, the mean visual acuities for the 3 groups were 67.7, 68.2, and 
68.4 (p=0.94) at week 52 and 67.9, 67.2, and 68.3 (p=0.67) at week 104.
Figure 4A shows the mean change in total central retinal thickness (CRT) after treatment for 
each group. The group with CME had the largest decrease in mean CRT at all points during 
follow-up. At week 104, the mean decrease in CRT thickness was 241 microns in the group 
with CME, 175 microns in the group with IRF without CME, and 114 microns in the group 
with neither CME nor IRF (p<0.001). By 24 weeks and beyond, all groups had similar mean 
total CRT (Figure 4B).
Study eye features over time by CME and IRF status
Table 3 summarizes morphologic findings over the follow-up period in eyes with CME 
compared with those without CME at baseline. At both 52 and 104 weeks follow-up, eyes 
with CME or IRF at baseline had lower percentages of active CNV. At 104 weeks, 24.0% of 
those with CME had active CNV compared with 26.2% with IRF without CME and 36.0% 
without IRF or CME (p=0.01). Those with IRF (both CME and non-CME eyes) had the 
highest rates of geographic atrophy at baseline, 1 and 2 years follow-up (p<0.001 for all time 
points). While all groups had similar rates of scarring at baseline (p=0.41), 17.3% of CME 
eyes had scar at the foveal center at 2 years follow-up compared with 6.7% of IRF eyes and 
6.9% of eyes with neither CME nor IRF (p<0.001). Among patients treated with PRN for 2 
years, the total number of injections was similar among the 3 groups with an adjusted mean 
of 12.2 in the group with CME, 12.3 in the group with IRF without CME, and 12.5 in the 
group with neither CME nor IRF (p=0.95).
Discussion
Previously published results from CATT and other large-scale studies have shown that the 
presence of intraretinal fluid during follow-up is associated with worse visual acuity while 
the presence of sub-RPE fluid has relatively little impact on vision and the presence of 
subretinal fluid is associated with better visual acuity.6,7 Our study examined a specific type 
of intraretinal fluid – angiographically-present cystoid macular edema – and assessed its 
impact on visual outcomes in the CATT study patients. We found an association between 
angiographic cystoid macular edema and visual acuity, but not with change in visual acuity 
after treatment. After adjustment for other risk factors for visual acuity during follow-up, the 
visual acuity at 1 and 2 years of follow-up were similar whether IRF or CME were present, 
so that having CME does not portend post-treatment visual acuity worse than would be 
expected based on the pretreatment level of visual acuity. In addition, while total central 
retinal thickness for eyes with CME was greater at baseline than in eyes with IRF without 
CME and in eyes with neither CME nor IRF, this equalized in all groups at 1 and 2 years

 follow-up. Despite these findings, CME eyes had the worst visual acuity both at baseline 
and at 2 years follow-up.
At baseline, the patients with CME, as well as those with IRF were slightly older with lower 
mean BMI. This raises the possibility that intraretinal fluid and cystoid macular edema may 
develop in patients with more fragile health. On the other hand, diabetes was less common 
in patients with CME or IRF. Pseudophakic eyes were more common in the CME group, but 
not to a statistically significant degree (p=0.06). It is not surprising that CME with IRF had 
an association with RAP lesions as there is disruption of the inner retina during this 
process.12 The CME group had a higher proportion of classic CNV, known to be associated 
with worse visual acuity at presentation.
The reason that the CME group had worse visual acuity at study entry and during follow-up 
is likely multifactorial. First, our study showed that a high proportion of CME is associated 
with subfoveal CNV, which has a greater negative impact on vision than occult or non-
foveal lesions.13 Second, as mentioned above, associations with hemorrhage and RAP 
lesions may also lead to further retinal damage and poor visual recovery as these entities are 
thought to be associated with more “aggressive” nAMD.12 Third, despite there being less 
active CNV leakage at week 104 in the CME group compared to the others with anti-VEGF 
therapy, there were higher rates of geographic atrophy and scarring in this group. The 
proportion with foveal geographic atrophy was similar in eyes with CME and eyes with IRF 
without CME, but higher than in the eyes with neither CME nor IRF. Formation of scar 
occurred more often in eyes with CME especially near the fovea. The higher incidence of 
scarring with CME may be related to the fact that more of these patients have classic CNV 
which histopathologically corresponds to type 2 CNV located between RPE and 
neurosensory retina; hence, contraction of this type of CNV leads to RPE loss or 
hyperplasia. Lastly, CME is a marker for fluid persistence in nAMD, and signifies patients 
with worse disease at baseline. With the exception of RAP-associated exudation, the 
exudative process in nAMD typically begins in the outer retina with collection of fluid here 
first and pervades the inner retina only when the external limiting membrane is broken 
down, which is related to the amount and time the fluid is present. The damage incurred to 
the retinal microstructure from this process creates an effect of poor visual acuity that 
persists despite resolution of the fluid on OCT at weeks 52 and 104 weeks.
In conclusion, CME is associated with worse visual acuity in nAMD. Patients with CME 
have an improvement in visual acuity after anti-VEGF treatment similar in magnitude to the 
improvement in other treated eyes, but not enough to compensate for their initially poor 
visual acuity. While CME is not commonly seen with nAMD, its presence should alert the 
clinician of poorer visual outcomes and higher rates for eventual atrophy and scarring.
