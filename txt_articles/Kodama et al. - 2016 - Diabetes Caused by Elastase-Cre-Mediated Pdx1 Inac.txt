Endocrine and exocrine pancreas tissues are both derived from the posterior foregut endoderm, 
however, the interdependence of these two cell types during their formation is not well understood. 
In this study, we generated mutant mice, in which the exocrine tissue is hypoplastic, in order to reveal 
a possible requirement for exocrine pancreas tissue in endocrine development and/or function. Since 
previous studies showed an indispensable role for Pdx1 in pancreas organogenesis, we used Elastase-
Cre-mediated recombination to inactivate Pdx1 in the pancreatic exocrine lineage during embryonic 
stages. Along with exocrine defects, including impaired acinar cell maturation, the mutant mice 
exhibited substantial endocrine defects, including disturbed tip/trunk patterning of the developing 
ductal structure, a reduced number of Ngn3-expressing endocrine precursors, and ultimately fewer β 
cells. Notably, postnatal expansion of the endocrine cell content was extremely poor, and the mutant 
mice exhibited impaired glucose homeostasis. These findings suggest the existence of an unknown 
but essential factor(s) in the adjacent exocrine tissue that regulates proper formation of endocrine 
precursors and the expansion and function of endocrine tissues during embryonic and postnatal stages.
The mature pancreas is composed of two functional components: exocrine and endocrine tissue. Both tissue 
types originate during embryonic organogenesis from a common pool of multipotent pancreatic progenitors 
located within the pancreatic buds. Previous gene knockout studies have identified several crucial transcription 
factors in pancreas development. Neurogenin 3 (Ngn3)-null mice exhibit a lack of differentiated endocrine cells 
and an absence of endocrine transcription factors including Isl1, Pax4/6 and NeuroD1. Further, inactivation of 
NeuroD results in a significant reduction in endocrine cell numbers and impaired islet formation2,3. It has also 
been demonstrated that Ptf1a-null mice completely lack exocrine acinar cells but have a small number of endo-
crine cells4,5.
Although these studies have demonstrated that these genes function in the specification/differentiation of 
particular cell types during pancreatogenesis, there remains limited understanding about the degree of interplay 
between endocrine and exocrine development. We previously reported that reduced Ptf1a dosage resulted in 
remarkably reduced branching of the ductal tree with delayed specification/differentiation of acinar cells and 
pancreatic hypoplasia6. Interestingly, in hypomorphic Ptf1a mutants, the timing of endocrine cell differentiation 
was normal, but the total number of insulin-producing β 
 cells was substantially reduced and the structure of islets 
disturbed, resulting in impaired glucose homeostasis. These findings supported the hypothesis that exocrine pan-
creatic tissue functions as a matrix necessary for proper endocrine pancreas formation4. However, since Ptf1a is 
expressed in the precursors of both acinar and endocrine cells5,6, we could not determine whether the endocrine 
defects observed in the hypomorphic Ptf1a mutants were cell-autonomous effects within the endocrine lineage 
or secondary effects of impaired exocrine formation.
Pancreatic and duodenal homeobox1 (Pdx1), which is the causative gene of maturity-onset diabetes of the 
young 4 (MODY4)7,8, regulates the transcription of genes involved in glucose homeostasis, such as insulin, glu-
cokinase and glucose transporter type 2 (GLUT2), in adult β 
 cells9–11. Developmentally, Pdx1 expression is first 
detected at approximately embryonic day 8.5 (E8.5) in the undifferentiated posterior foregut endoderm in mice12. 
As development proceeds, its expression expands to a wider region, including the dorsal and ventral pancreatic

buds, developing antral stomach, duodenum and the lower bile duct. During mid-to-late embryonic stages, its 
expression is increased in β 
 cells, but decreased in exocrine acinar/duct cells and epithelial cells of the com-
mon bile duct and rostral duodenum. Gene inactivation studies have demonstrated pivotal roles for Pdx1 during 
embryogenesis, as global Pdx1 knockout results in pancreatic agenesis, a lack of Brunner’s glands and malforma-
tion of the major duodenal papilla13–15.
Since Pdx1 is indispensable for the formation of pancreatic exocrine and endocrine cells during development, 
we expected that exocrine-specific inactivation of Pdx1 would be an ideal way to generate exocrine-lacking or 
hypoplastic mutants in which we could test if exocrine tissue is required for proper endocrine formation and 
function. For this purpose, we performed Elastase-Cre-mediated Pdx1 inactivation and analyzed the pancreatic 
phenotype and function. We demonstrate that the mutant mice showed not only exocrine defects, but also fewer 
endocrine precursors and endocrine cells with less proliferation and delayed maturation, resulting in impaired 
glucose homeostasis. These findings support the notion that the exocrine pancreas is required for proper endo-
crine development and function, and that normal development of the pancreas occurs in an interactive, coordi-
nated manner between the two tissues.
Results
Elastase-Cre-mediated Pdx1 inactivation causes pancreatic hypoplasia and growth retarda-
tion. 
First, we evaluated the specificity and efficiency of the Elastase-Cre-mediated recombination. Lineage 
tracing of Elastase-Cre-expressing cells in control mice (Pdx1+/+;Elastase-Cre;ROSA26r and Pdx1loxP/+;Elastase-
Cre;ROSA26r mice) showed that most progeny of Elastase-Cre-expressing cells differentiated into acinar cells 
at P1, but a subpopulation was detected in small ductal structures contiguous with the acini (Fig. S1). The pro-
portion of lineage-labeled cells in Cytokeratin(+ 
) duct cells tended to decrease during late embryonic stages 
in Pdx1loxP/+;Elastase-Cre;ROSA26r mice (approximately 10% at E16.5, 3% at P1 and 4% at P7), suggesting that 
lineage-labeled cells in the terminal ducts retained the ability to differentiate to acinar cells even at late embryonic 
to neonatal stages. Extremely few endocrine cells were labeled at P1 (Fig. S1): 0.44–1.30% and 0.57–0.80% in 
Pdx1+/+;Elastase-Cre;ROSA26r and Pdx1loxP/+;Elastase-Cre;ROSA26r mice, respectively (n = 
 3; at least 40 islets 
and 4000 endocrine cells were counted per mouse). These observations indicate satisfactory efficiency and speci-
ficity of the Elastase-Cre-based recombination in the exocrine lineage and negligible Cre expression in the endo-
crine lineage.
Newborn pups of Pdx1cKO mice (Pdx1loxP/−;Elastase-Cre;ROSA26r or Pdx1loxP/loxP;Elastase-Cre;ROSA26r 
mice) were indistinguishable from control littermates, but the body size of the mutant mice was clearly reduced 
by P7 (Fig. 1A). Mutants also had smaller pancreas and showed pancreatic hypoplasia at P7 based on histology 
(Fig. 1B). They exhibited growth retardation (Fig. 1C), and half did not survive to weaning. Pancreatic hypoplasia 
persisted in the survivors (Fig. 1D), and the pancreata of mutant mice were even smaller than expected from the 
reduced body size (Fig. 1E); the percentages of pancreas weight/body weight in the control mice were 0.61%, 
0.39%, and 1.01% at P1, P7 and P28, respectively, while those in the mutants were 0.14%, 0.11% and 0.39% at P1, 
P7 and P28, respectively. Increased fat content in the stool of Pdx1loxP/−;Elastase-Cre;ROSA26r mice was detected, 
suggesting exocrine dysfunction and an associated decrease in lipid absorption by the small intestine. We could 
not detect X-gal(+ 
) endocrine cells in Pdx1cKO mice at P1, strongly suggesting agenesis or the elimination of 
Pdx1-null endocrine cells during embryonic stages.
Elastase-Cre-mediated Pdx1 inactivation results in impaired exocrine differentiation during 
organogenesis. 
Developmentally, X-gal(+ 
) cells became detectable at E12.5 in the pancreatic epithelia 
of control and Pdx1cKO mice (Fig. 2A,E,I,M). Although some X-gal(+ 
) cells in Pdx1cKO mice retained Pdx1 
immunoreactivity at E13.5, Pdx1 expression was no longer detected in X-gal(+ 
) cells at E14.5 or E16.5 (Fig. S2), 
showing that the Elastase promoter-driven Cre recombinase successfully activated the β 
-galactosidase gene at the 
ROSA26 locus and inactivated the Pdx1 gene by E14.5. The expression of Pdx1 in some lineage-labeled cells at 
E13.5 may be explained by the relatively stable nature of the Pdx1 protein translated prior to gene recombination.
Until E14.5, there were no apparent macroscopic differences between the pancreata of control and Pdx1cKO 
mice (Fig. 2A,B,I,J), but the pancreata of the mutant mice was clearly smaller at E16.5 and did not recover after-
wards (Fig. 2C,K). Histologically, exocrine development in the control mice resembled that of wild-type mice, 
with normal branching of the ductal tree at E14.5 and many amylase-expressing acinar cells detected at E16.5 
(Fig. 2F,G). At P1, fully mature acinar cells were observed with basal nuclei, abundant cytoplasmic secretory 
granules and a low nucleus:cytoplasm ratio (Fig. 2H). In contrast, there was abnormal exocrine development in 
Pdx1cKO mice: despite no apparent macroscopic differences with control pancreata, the ductal tree was poorly 
branched and had a slightly dilated lumen at E14.5 (Fig. 2N). In addition, only few amylase-expressing cells were 
detected at E16.5 (Fig. 2O-inset) and acinar cytodifferentiation was extremely impaired, as acinar cells were much 
smaller and cuboidal, had few cytoplasmic granules, and a centrally located nucleus (Fig. 2P).
Elastase-Cre-mediated Pdx1 mutant mice exhibit impaired glucose homeostasis with 
reduced insulin secretion. 
To test the hypothesis that disturbed exocrine development causes abnor-
mal endocrine development and/or function, we compared Pdx1cKO mice (Pdx1loxP/loxP;Elastase-Cre mice) 
to Pdx1+/+;Elastase-Cre mice controls, because a dosage effect of Pdx1 in endocrine function was previously 
reported16,17. Interestingly, the mutant mice were mildly hyperglycemic, and IPGTT demonstrated a significant 
impairment in glucose homeostasis in Pdx1cKO mice at P28 (Fig. 3A). Plasma insulin 15 min after glucose injec-
tion was significantly lower in mutants (Fig. 3B).

glucose homeostasis in Pdx1cKO mice, we analyzed embryonic pancreas formation. At E14.5, β 
-gal(+ 
) cells 
were detected in the tip of the branching ductal tree in both control and Pdx1cKO mice (Fig. 4A). The number 
of lineage-labeled cells was significantly reduced in Pdx1cKO mice, while that of non-labeled cells remained 
the same as that in control mice at this stage (Fig. 4B). Consistent with the macroscopically smaller pancreas at 
E16.5, PHH3 and TUNEL staining revealed that the progeny of Pdx1-inactivated cells (β 
-gal(+ 
) cells) in mutant 
mice proliferated less (Fig. 4C) and had increased apoptosis at E14.5 (Fig. 4D). Interestingly, while the percent-
age of PHH3(+ 
) cells in the non-lineage labeled cells remained the same between control and mutant mice, we 
observed increased cell death of the β 
-gal(− 
) cells in mutant mice, suggesting non-cell autonomous effects within 
the developing ductal tree (Fig. 4C,D).
Impaired tip/trunk patterning in Elastase-Cre-mediated Pdx1 mutant mice. 
It was previously 
reported that the developing ductal tree gradually obtains tip/trunk patterning through which regional control 
of endocrine and exocrine differentiation is determined; endocrine cells originate from the Nkx6.1-expressing 
trunk domain, whereas exocrine acinar cells are differentiated from Ptf1a-expressing tip domain after E1418–20.

Considering possible non-cell autonomous effects on cell survival within the developing ductal tree (Fig. 4D), 
we speculated that conditional inactivation of Pdx1 by the Elastase-Cre transgene disturbs the tip/trunk pattern-
ing of the ductal tree to reduce the formation of endocrine precursors in Pdx1cKO mice. As shown in Fig. 5A, 
the majority of lineage-labeled and non-labeled cells in control mice at E14.5 were Ptf1a(+ 
)Nkx6.1(− 
) tip cells 
and Ptf1a(− 
)Nkx6.1(+ 
) trunk cells, respectively, suggesting that Elastase-Cre-mediated recombination occurred 
predominantly in the tip region. However, in mutant mice, not only was the percentage of Ptf1a-expressing cells 
reduced in the lineage-labeled tip region, but so too was the percentage of Nkx6.1(+ 
) trunk cells. Reflecting 
this phenotype, the percentage of Ptf1a(− 
)Nkx6.1(− 
) cells was increased in the mutants. In addition, we found 
abnormal cell differentiation in the trunk region. At E14.5, ductal epithelium in the trunk region is composed of 
Hnf1β 
-expressing cells21. However, while most Hnf1β 
-expressing cells coexpressed Nkx6.1 in control mice, they 
did not in Pdx1cKO mutant mice (Fig. 5B). Thus, Ptf1a(− 
)Nkx6.1(− 
) cells, which were increased in the mutants, 
are suspected to be mainly composed of Hnf1β 
(+ 
) cells. Finally, epithelial cells had a reduced percentage of 
Ngn3-expression and fewer β 
 cells in mutant mice at E14.5 (Fig. 5C,D).
Reduced proliferation and delayed maturation of endocrine cells is accompanied by islet dis-
organization in Elastase-Cre-mediated Pdx1 mutant mice. 
At P1, Pdx1cKO mice formed smaller 
islets and the total endocrine area was 17% that of control (Fig. 6A,B). Between P1-P28, approximately 5.45-fold 
expansion in pancreatic endocrine cell content occurred in control mice, but only 3.57-fold in Pdx1cKO mice

and histological views. X-gal(+ 
) progeny of Elastase-Cre-expressing cells were detectable as early as E12.5 
(A,E,I,M). Pancreatic hypoplasia in Pdx1cKO mice was macroscopically apparent at E16.5 (compare K with C), 
but the histological phenotype was detected earlier. At E14.5, Pdx1cKO mice displayed reduced branching and 
dilated morphogenesis of the ductal tree (compare N with F). At E16.5, in control mice, the pancreatic ductal 
tree was well branched and many amylase-expressing cells were detected (G), but in Pdx1cKO mice branching of 
the ductal tree was reduced and amylase-expressing cells were fewer (O) (insets in (G,O) colabeled for amylase 
(red) and cytokeratin (green)). Hypoplastic pancreas persisted at P1 (compare L with D). In control mice, fully 
mature acinar cells were well developed, contained abundant exocrine granules with polarized subcellular 
localization of the nucleus on the basal side and had a low nucleus:cytoplasm ratio (H). In contrast, Pdx1cKO mice 
showed impaired acinar cytodifferentiation, and their acinar cells were smaller in size, had less polarized nuclear 
localization and a high nucleus:cytoplasm ratio (P). Scale bars, 50 μ 
m.

(Fig. 6A,B). Consequently, the endocrine content of mutant pancreata corresponded to approximately 11% that 
found in control mice at P28. It should be noted that the reduction in endocrine cell content was even more severe 
than predicted from the reduced body weight (approximately 81% that of control mice) and pancreas weight 
(approximately 31% that of control mice) at P28 (Fig. 1C,D). Immunolabeling for PHH3 revealed reduced pro-
liferation of endocrine cells in the mutant pancreata at P1 (Fig. 6C), while TUNEL assays showed no significant 
difference (Fig. 6D).
Finally, in Pdx1cKO mice, along with the reduced pancreatic endocrine cell number, the maturation of β 
cells was delayed at P1, according to the reduced expression of GLUT2 and MafA. However, the produc-
tion of these proteins was restored to control levels by P28 (Fig. 6E). Islet architecture was also impaired, and 
glucagon-producing cells and insulin-producing cells were intermingled even within the few relatively large islets 
that were present at P28 (Fig. 6F).
Discussion
The pancreas is an unusual organ in that two functionally independent tissues co-exist. Accordingly, investiga-
tors have sought potential interactions between exocrine and endocrine tissues. Here, we assessed the effects 
exocrine tissue has on endocrine development. Previous reports have shown that adult exocrine-driven factor(s) 
can regulate endocrine tissue. For example, Reg1 is expressed in the exocrine pancreas but stimulates β 
 cell prolif-
eration in a rat regeneration model22. More recently, Xiao et al. showed that exocrine tissue extracts from normal 
adult mice or from a pancreatic-duct-ligated model (PDL model) induced Ngn3 expression in cultured β 
 cells23. 
In addition, loss of exocrine-derived Sostdc, a dual BMP and Wnt inhibitor, enhances insulin secretion under 
metabolic stress in adult pancreas24. Considering that embryonic mechanisms are sometimes reactivated in the 
regeneration process of an injured organ, we speculated that similar exocrine-to-endocrine effects play a role in 
normal pancreatogenesis.
To test this theory, we needed a mouse model whose exocrine tissue is severely hypoplastic or lacking dur-
ing development. We created a new mutant mouse in which Pdx1, an indispensable gene for pancreas for-
mation, is depleted in an exocrine-specific manner. As expected, Elastase-Cre-mediated Pdx1 inactivation 
caused severe exocrine defects after complete depletion of Pdx1 protein by E14.5, which is consistent with a 
report by Hale et al.25. However, they did not deplete Pdx1 in an exocrine-specific manner and instead used a 
tetracycline-responsive transactivator to temporally control the inactivation of Pdx1. Furthermore, they reported 
that Pdx1 depletion at E13.5 resulted in impaired pancreas formation characterized by immature acinar cell dif-
ferentiation and dilated duct-like structures that resembled the exocrine defects in our Pdx1cKO mice. We believe 
the experimental results described in the present study are the first demonstration that selectively abrogating 
exocrine formation during embryonic stages reduces the proliferation and delays the maturation of endocrine 
cells along with altering the islet structure to cause insufficient insulin release in mice.
It has been reported that the lineage specification of pancreatic exocrine/endocrine precursor cells is region-
ally controlled within the developing branches of the epithelial tree. Zhou et al. used Cpa1-CreER-mediated 
time-specific lineage tracing to show that Pdx1+Ptf1a+cMychighCpa1+ multipotent progenitor cells are located at 
the tips of the epithelial branches at early-to-mid embryogenesis (approx. E13–14) while endocrine/duct bipotent 
precursors are located within the trunk epithelium19. Consistent with this, we previously showed that a reduced 
dose of Ptf1a caused extreme impairment of branch formation throughout embryogenesis and glucose intol-
erance after birth6. Our study also suggested that the formation of a poorly branched ductal tree during early 
pancreatic development caused a reduction in the number of multipotent tip cells by E14.5, resulting in a smaller

endocrine precursor pool in Ptf1a hypomorphic mice6. While our Elastase-Cre-mediated Pdx1 mutant mice 
exhibited reduced branching of the ductal tree and a smaller percentage of Ptf1a-expressing cells, the reduced 
branching was less severe than in Ptf1a hypomorphic mice. Pdx1 depletion occurred relatively late, at around 
E13.5-14.5, which coincides with when tip cells lost their multipotency. We found that inactivation of Pdx1 by the 
Elastase-Cre transgene, which occurred in the tip region, caused abnormal cell differentiation, less proliferation 
and elevated cell death in the trunk domain, resulting in less formation of Ngn3(+ 
) endocrine precursors. Thus, 
we propose that the reduced endocrine cell number in Pdx1cKO mice is not endocrine-autonomous, but due to 
an unidentified factor(s) provided by the exocrine tissue that stimulates endocrine differentiation and expansion 
during embryonic and postnatal development. Alternatively, the reduced branching at mid-to-late developmental 
stages could have resulted in fewer niche locations for endocrine progenitors to form in Elastase-Cre-mediated 
Pdx1 mutant mice.

We also provide evidence that β 
 cell maturation is delayed in the mutant mice, as demonstrated by the 
decreased immunoreactivity of Glut2 and MafA in perinatal islets. Although both proteins were restored to nor-
mal levels by P28, we observed a long-lived altered islet structure. Islet dysmorphogenesis is thought to relate to 
islet dysfunction, as peripheral cell types intermingling with β 
 cells might disrupt gap junctions or other inter-
cellular coupling involved in efficient insulin release26. Cell death within the islets can also impair islet architec-
ture27. Thus, the formation and elimination of Pdx1-inactivated endocrine cells during specific developmental 
stages could have contributed to islet dysmorphogenesis. These results warrant future studies on the mechanisms 
underlying the formation and maintenance of normal islet structure, especially in terms of exocrine effects on 
endocrine development.

Mice. 
We obtained Elastase promoter-driven Cre transgenic mice28, mice carrying a floxed Pdx1 allele 
(Pdx1loxP)27, Pdx1 wild-type mice (Pdx1+) and mice with null alleles (Pdx1–)14. Mating the Elastase promot-
er-driven Cre transgenic mice with ROSA26r mice29 enabled us to lineage-label Elastase-Cre transgene-ex-
pressing cells and their progeny as X-gal-positive or β

at P1 and P28. Expressions of Glut2 and MafA were reduced in the islets of mutant mice at P1, but reached normal 
level by P28 (E). The islet structure of Pdx1cKO mice was disrupted at P1 and P28 based on the intermingling of 
glucagon-expressing cells within the islet (F). Scale bars, 500 μ

(Pdx1loxP/−;Elastase-Cre;ROSA26r or Pdx1loxP/loxP;Elastase-Cre;ROSA26r) mice (Figs 1 and 2), Pdx1loxP/+;Elastase-
Cre;ROSA26r mice were used as controls, since Pdx1 heterozygous mice develop almost identically to wild-
type mice during embryogenesis14. When analyzing endocrine development and function (Figs 3–6), however, 
Pdx1+/+;Elastase-Cre;ROSA26r mice were used as controls, since a dosage requirement for Pdx1 has been sug-
gested in endocrine function16,17. All animal experiments were performed in accordance with the Kyoto University 
guidelines for animal experiments and approved by the animal research committee of Kyoto University.
Genotyping. 
Genomic DNA from either mouse embryonic heads or postnatal tail tips was genotyped by 
PCR using the primer sets listed in Table S1.
Tissue Preparation for X-gal Staining and Paraffin Sections. 
Tissue preparation, X-gal staining and 
paraffin sections were performed as previously described5.
Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. 
After rehydration, slides were washed and incu-
bated for 30 min at room temperature with Protein Block (Dako) followed by overnight incubation at 4 °C with 
primary antibodies (Table S2). The sections were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated for 
60 min with secondary antibodies (Table S3). Images were taken with a BX51 microscope (Olympus) or BZ-9000E 
HS All-in-one Fluorescence Microscope (Keyence).
PHH3 staining and TUNEL assays. 
Mitotic activity was analyzed by immunolabeling with rabbit 
anti-phospho-Histone H3 (Ser10) (Millipore). TUNEL assays were done using the DeadEnd Fluorometric system 
(Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Cell Counting. 
Cell numbers were counted at × 
200 magnification in three randomly selected sections per 
pancreas, and the proportion of the desired cell types to all epithelial cells was calculated. To evaluate the relative 
endocrine area, the whole pancreas was sectioned in 3 μ 
m intervals, and the number of Chromogranin-A(+ 
) cells 
was counted in every hundredth slide.
Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (IPGTT). 
After overnight fasting, we measured blood glucose 
before- and 15, 30, 60 and 120 minutes after D-glucose injection (2 mg/g body weight, intraperitoneally) by a 
Glucocard DIA meter (GT1641) (Arkray). To evaluate insulin release 15 min after glucose challenge, blood was 
centrifuged in the presence of aprotinin (100 kIE/ml blood; Wako Chemicals), and serum insulin was measured 
with a mouse insulin ELISA kit (U-type) (Shibayagi).
Statistical Analysis. 
All indices were analyzed using the t-test (two-tailed).
