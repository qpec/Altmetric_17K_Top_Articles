Abstract
This study reports on implementation of the CommunityRx system, a population health innovation 
that promoted clinic-community linkages via: a youth workforce (MAPSCorps) that conducted an 
annual community resource census; Community Health Information Specialists (CHIS) who 
supported cross-sector resource navigation; and a health information technology (HIT) for 
prescribing community resources. Between 2012–14, MAPSCorps identified 19,589 public-
serving places in the 106mi2 implementation region. CHIS used these data to generate an 
inventory of nearly 15,000 health-promoting resources. The HIT platform was integrated with 3 
electronic health record (EHR) systems at 33 clinical sites to map 37 prevalent health and wellness 
conditions to community resources; 253,479 personalized HealtheRx “prescriptions” were 
generated for approximately 113,000 participants. Participants found the HealtheRx very useful 
(83%); 19% went to a place they learned about from the HealtheRx. This study demonstrates the 
feasibility of using HIT and workforce innovation to bridge the gap between clinical and other 
health-promoting sectors.
INTRODUCTION
The Affordable Care Act (ACA) shifts the value proposition in health care delivery from 
fees generated by delivering medical services to people with illness to savings generated by 
optimizing the physical and mental health of the population served. Physicians1 and other 
caregivers2 recognize the importance of community-based resources for effective prevention 
and management of disease, but access to high quality information about these resources is 
exceedingly poor. Effective population health management requires an information 
technology (IT) infrastructure, driven by high quality community resource data, that enables 
health care providers and consumers to address basic, wellness, and disease management 
needs.
Electronic medication prescribing (“e-prescribing”) establishes the feasibility of integrating 
IT infrastructure across sectors to promote population health. Medication e-prescribing 
produces data used by the pharmaceutical industry, insurers, and policymakers for drug 
development, coverage, and quality monitoring. By 2014, 70% of physicians and 96% of

 community pharmacies were exchanging data via a single, integrated e-prescribing 
infrastructure.3 An analogous IT system, similarly supported by policy incentives and a 
dynamic source of high-quality community resource data, could enable cross-sector 
accountability for and optimization of population health.
In 2011, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI) announced the Health 
Care Innovation Award (HCIA) funding opportunity. HCIA called for “the most compelling 
new ideas to deliver better health and improved care at lower cost,” emphasizing 
technology-based, scalable ideas with potential to impact underserved populations and 
create jobs.4 CommunityRx, a HCIA innovation, adapted the Kilbridge e-prescribing model 
(Appendix Exhibit 1)5,6 and an asset-based, community engaged approach7 to engineer an 
IT solution that enabled clinicians to e-prescribe community resources for basic, wellness, 
and disease self-management needs.
The CommunityRx intervention included three components: (1) a youth workforce 
(MAPSCorps) that conducted an annual census of community resources, (2) Community 
Health Information Specialists (CHIS) who both surveyed community resources and 
supported participant navigation to resources, and (3) an IT platform for community 
resource prescribing. The IT platform interfaced with EHR workflows to generate 
personalized “HealtheRx prescriptions” (Appendix Exhibit 2)6 delivered to the patient at the 
point of care.
We report on implementation of the CommunityRx system, examining process-based 
outcomes. The HCIA application required innovators to project the expected impact and 
propose a business plan for sustainability beyond the 36 month funding period. Self 
(NCT02411409) and external evaluations,8 assessing percent change in cost per beneficiary 
per year, are underway.
STUDY DATA AND METHODS
The first 8 months of the award (7/12–2/13) included Institutional Review Board approval 
and workforce and IT development. CommunityRx used continuous quality improvement 
and rapid cycle iteration methods.9
In month 9, the CommunityRx system launched at one federally qualified health center 
(FQHC). Academic medical (University of Chicago affiliates) and community (FQHC) sites 
were recruited to ensure broad geographic coverage, wide inclusion of Medicare- and 
Medicaid-eligible people, and diversity of practice types (e.g. school-based, senior center, 
emergency care) and EHR platforms (Exhibit 1). CHIS, located at the University of Chicago 
and at community-based organizations across the region, supported participant navigation to 
resources and surveyed community service providers (CSPs) in assigned service areas. By 
month 28, the implementation region included 16 contiguous south and west side Chicago 
ZIP codes (106mi2, 993K total population, 58% <200% federal poverty level), including the 
University of Chicago’s primary service area. Individuals residing in the implementation 
region seen at participating clinical sites were eligible. “Participants” included individuals 
for whom at least one HealtheRx was generated.

 Community Resource Inventory
MAPSCorps paired local high school students with science-oriented young adults (mostly 
college students) to conduct an annual “feet-on-the-street” census (summers 2013–15) of all 
CSPs open to the public (“operating”). We have previously described the MAPSCorps 
protocol in detail and reported that methods yield far more accurate community resource 
data than widely used secondary sources.10 MAPSCorps methods have been replicated in 
New York City and Niagara Falls, NY (supported by New York State Health Foundation), 
and Edgecombe and Nash Counties, NC (supported by NIH/NHLB 2K24 HL 105493-06). 
In short, using the MapApp™ smartphone application, youth walked block by block, 
gathering data by direct observation for each CSP including: name, address, phone number, 
the CSP’s primary function, and whether it was operating. MAPSCorps data were posted 
annually to www.mapscorps.org and www.dondeesta.org. Youth demographics and 
employment history were self-reported.
In month 7, we initiated telephone surveys with CSPs identified by MAPSCorps. These 
surveys, conducted primarily by CHIS, collected data about the resources (programs and 
services) provided by each place, including eligibility and cost. Surveys prioritized places 
that were likely to offer resources indicated for wellness and the target health conditions. 
Resource data were posted to www.HealtheRx.org.
Community Resources E-prescribing
The IT solution linked EHR platforms to the CommunityRx system. At the end of the 
clinical visit, data from participants’ EHR (ICD-9 codes, age, home address, primary 
language and other variables) were sent via automated, secure web call to query the 
CommunityRx server. Using an algorithm that combined clinical and public health 
guidelines with expert opinion, the server generated the HealtheRx: a personalized list of 
community resources near the participant’s home address (Appendix Exhibit 3).6 The 
HealtheRx returned within seconds (median 2.1) to a local printer and posted to the EHR. 
The participant received the HealtheRx from a health care provider with a brief (1–2 
sentence) explanation that included orientation to the CHIS role and CHIS contact 
information. In 29 sites, the HealtheRx printed with the “click” that triggered the visit 
summary (a meaningful use requirement);11 in 4 sites, one “extra click” was required.
Process measures are reported for months 9–36, with the exception of measures requiring 
EHR data which were only available for analysis through month 35. Analyses of resource 
referral patterns used data from months 30–35 when the CommunityRx system, including 
target conditions and geography, were at steady state.
Participant experience was assessed months 9–36 by a cross-sectional phone survey. 
Participants (~20/month) were recruited through an advertisement on the HealtheRx that 
offered a monetary incentive. Provider experience was assessed months 9–36 using an 
anonymous cross-sectional self-administered survey. Baseline surveys were collected pre-
launch and follow-up surveys were conducted every 6 months post-launch. Using an item 
from a 2011 Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) survey,1 we assessed providers’

 attitudes about patients’ social needs. This study analyzes provider data from 11 sites with 
consistent participation at baseline and 12 months.
Analyses were conducted using Stata/SE vs14.0 (College Station, Texas).
Limitations
EHR data were available for 19 sites; data for 14 FQHCs (most of which launched in the last 
5 months of the implementation) were excluded due to acquisition and cost barriers. 
Excluded sites’ payer mix and patient volume, age, and income were similar to included 
sites, but they had a higher proportion of Hispanic patients.12 Although EHR data included a 
unique patient identifier, confidentiality concerns and cost prohibited linkage of individual-
level EHR data across sites. Self-reported youth, participant, and provider survey data may 
be limited by response bias. Provider survey data are limited by variable participation across 
sites.
RESULTS
Community Resource Inventory
MAPSCorps covered 106mi2; youth walked an average 4.6 miles/day. MAPSCorps 
identified 19,589 places providing community resources. During the implementation, 
MAPSCorps created 224 paid positions for youth (83% identified as black, non-Hispanic; 
9% Hispanic, non-black; 2% black, Hispanic; 51% female) and 64 paid positions for young 
adult mentors. MAPSCorps was the first paid employment for 53% of youth.
English and Spanish-speaking CHIS were deployed at partnering community-based 
organizations (n=4) and with the central team (n=3) (Exhibit 1). CHIS used MAPSCorps 
data to produce the CSP inventory (Appendix Exhibit 4)6. Of 19,589 CSPs, 30% (n=5,952) 
completed a baseline survey.
Community Resources E-prescribing
The CommunityRx IT system was integrated with three EHR platforms (Epic, GE 
Centricity™, NextGen®) operating at 33 clinical sites (Exhibit 1). By month 28, the system 
was generating HealtheRxs for 37 target conditions (wellness for 7 age groups; 23 medical, 
6 mental or behavioral health conditions; and homelessness)(Appendix Exhibit 3).6
More than 1,600 providers (physicians, nurses and other staff), were trained to deliver the 
HealtheRx. At baseline, 86% (n=552/644) wished the health care system would pay for 
connecting patients to resources for unmet social needs and 19% (n=119/642) were “not at 
all confident” in their ability to meet their patients’ unmet social needs. The proportion “not 
at all confident” was 15% at 12 months (n=27/185)(Appendix Exhibit 5).6
During months 9–35, the CommunityRx system generated for an estimated 113,295 unique 
individuals, one or more HealtheRxs (253,479 total), with more than 8 million community 
resource referrals. More than a quarter of the population living in each of three of the 16 
implementation ZIP codes received at least one HealtheRx (Exhibit 1).

 Of participants surveyed (N=458), the majority (71%) found places listed that they did not 
know were in their community; 19% reported they went to a place they learned about 
because it was on their HealtheRx. Overall satisfaction was high: 79% were very satisfied 
and 83% found the HealtheRx to be very useful. In month 19, we added a survey item to 
assess spread of HealtheRx information from participants to others: half (183/374, 49%) 
reported telling others about the HealtheRx. All but one person (reporting a neutral 
comment) told others something positive about the HealtheRx.
Looking at 19/33 sites for which complete steady state data (months 30–35) were available, 
an estimated 49,655 unique participants received a HealtheRx (Exhibit 2), of which 11,848 
were referred on average per month to one or more of 4,646 resources at 1,935 CSPs 
(Appendix Exhibit 6). The top referred resources are shown in Exhibit 3. We estimated 
potential strain on highly referred resources by the average number of participants referred/
month/resource. The most strained resources included: smoking cessation (n=1001 
participants referred/month/resource); pest control (n=497) and mold assessment (n=434); 
warming/cooling centers (n=295); weight loss (n=205); and help paying mortgage/rent 
(n=209). By ZIP code, total resources per 10,000 population ranged from 148 to 236 
(Exhibit 4, Appendix Exhibit 7).
During months 9–36, CHIS received 888 requests (<1% of all participants) for assistance 
accessing community resources (631 by phone, 193 by text, 64 by email or in person) 
(Appendix Exhibit 8).6 Between months 31–36 at sites affiliated with one FQHC partner, 
participants could elect to receive text messages from CHIS. Among those who received a 
text message from a CHIS in tandem with receipt of the HealtheRx (n=1448), the 
engagement rate increased to 14%. Two crisis requests (suicidality, child safety) requiring 
physician involvement were promptly resolved. Of the services participants requested, 71% 
were available at the participant’s medical home.
In the final quarter of the implementation period, clinical partners were given the option to 
have the CommunityRx system removed from their EHRs. Every partnering organization, 
with the exception of one planning to switch to a new EHR vendor, opted to continue use. 
Paraphrased from one internist at an FQHC: “CommunityRx is now woven into the fabric of 
what we do.”
DISCUSSION
In 2011, CMMI issued its first HCIA opportunity, described by the White House as “a call to 
action for technology and data innovators to team with care innovators to propose solutions 
that can be implemented with speed and have the opportunity to scale.”4 The CommunityRx 
system, built in partnership with the Office of the National Coordinator’s Chicago Health 
Information Technology Regional Extension Center and others, was operational in 9 months 
and scaled to integrate with 3 EHR platforms at 33 diverse clinical sites. More than 113,000 
patients, 1,600 clinicians, nearly 6,000 CSPs, and hundreds of young people were engaged. 
Participant satisfaction was consistently high. All but one clinical partner elected to continue 
operating CommunityRx after the HCIA funding ended. Most CMMI interventions targeted 
a specific disease or high risk subpopulation. In contrast, the CommunityRx system was

 designed horizontally - an infrastructure solution to serve people of all ages, seen in diverse 
clinical settings, for primary prevention and for management of a wide range of social and 
medical conditions.
The adapted Kilbridge model for prescribing community resources (Appendix Exhibit 1)5,6 
provides a useful framework for analysis of this study’s findings. The fulfillment phase, the 
period after the participant received the HealtheRx, began with evaluation: the clinician 
oriented the participant to the HealtheRx, including cost and eligibility information, and 
highlighted the CHIS information. Published evidence about patient adherence to 
community resource referrals was very limited when we proposed the CommunityRx 
innovation. In a small study of United Way 2-1-1 callers, 5/39 people (12.8%) referred to 
CSPs reported making an appointment.13 Based in part on this finding, we estimated that 
12% of participants would contact a CHIS or a CSP after receiving a HealtheRx.
The observed rate of engagement with the CHIS in our study was very low (<1%). CHIS 
hypothesized that the low rate of engagement was due to the comprehensiveness of 
information provided on the HealtheRx; they thought the HealtheRx provided most 
participants the information they needed to directly contact CSPs. This explanation is 
corroborated by the higher than expected rate (19%, by self-report) of participant 
presentation to at least one CSP that they learned about because it was on the HealtheRx.
The 19% community resource “dispense” rate (the proportion of participants who visited a 
referred CSP) likely underestimates the impact of the CommunityRx intervention on 
community resource use. Most participant surveys were completed within 2 weeks of 
receiving a HealtheRx, so subsequent CSP visits were not captured. This estimate does not 
include going to CSPs on the HealtheRx (or otherwise) that participants already knew (55% 
said they had ever been to at least one of the CSPs on their HealtheRx). Lastly, a third of 
participants received 2 or more HealtheRxs; a dose-response effect is possible. SMS texting 
appeared to multiply the effect of the intervention: we found a 70-fold increase in the rate of 
CHIS-participant interaction (from 0.2% in the 6 months before to 14% during the texting 
implementation).
The fulfillment phase of the process is complete when a community-based resource is 
administered (e.g. a person participates in an Alcoholics Anonymous™ meeting or receives 
food donation from a pantry). Although the CommunityRx model builds on medication e-
prescribing, it is important to note that the CommunityRx implementation did not digitally 
“close the loop” on its e-prescribing functionality. Medication e-prescribing sends an 
outbound message to the patient’s preferred pharmacy and indicates back to the prescriber, 
in the EHR workflow, information about patient fulfillment. Fulfillment occurs when the 
patient obtains the prescription; whether the patient administers the medication is typically 
ascertained during the patient-provider encounter. During the CommunityRx implementation 
study, we were not resourced to build an electronic interface for CSPs to receive referrals. 
We, therefore, could not track fulfillment beyond participant self-report. Additional 
technology and research are needed to more precisely estimate the effect of the HealtheRx 
on participant fulfillment (especially dispensing and administration) of community 
resources. Few empirical studies, including one RCT, of clinic-community resource referral

 interventions have been published;14–16 we find none that describe integration with the EHR 
or a closed loop IT solution.
Our findings suggest that national, cross-sector adoption of an IT solution to manage clinic-
community referrals might increase CSP visibility and generate meta-data to fill a major 
void in knowledge about community resources. In our study, among participating CSPs, 
42% had no website and many requests to CHIS were for resources the participant did not 
know were available at their own medical home. Meta-data from the CommunityRx 
implementation reveal variation in geospatial demand and wide disparities in supply of 
community resources. Among 10 ZIP codes with complete resource data, 26% of 
participants and 25% of the total population, including 27% of people 65 years and older, 
and 40% of Hispanic people were concentrated in 2 ZIP codes with the lowest resource 
density (148–150 resources/10K population versus 223–236/10K in the two highest ZIP 
codes). Meta-data like these were shared with CSPs during our study and are needed by 
communities and policymakers to monitor demand for and equitable access to community 
resources. By identifying resource gaps and inequities, these data can inform health-
promoting policy, community planning, community benefit investment by tax-exempt 
hospitals, and even entrepreneurial activities.
The CommunityRx system, especially the HealtheRx, acted like a vector, spreading 
information about community resources well beyond participant-provider encounters. In 
several ZIP codes, the intervention reached more than 20% of the total population, rendering 
the system a penetrant population health communication tool. With support from the 
National Institutes on Aging, we are now studying sustainability by applying a systems 
science approach to quantify the community-level impact and cost-effectiveness of the 
CommunityRx innovation and to project impact for other communities (1R01 AG 
047869-01, NCT02435511).
CONCLUSION
This study demonstrates the feasibility of using IT and workforce innovation to bridge the 
gap, at scale, between clinical and other health-promoting sectors in one high poverty urban 
region. Building clinic-community linkages to address patients’ health-related social needs 
also generated meaningful work for youth, shined light on and produced business 
intelligence for local health-promoting CSPs, and produced evidence about resource gaps 
that can be used to inform health-promoting community investments. The CommunityRx 
innovation came to life because CMS, the nation’s largest health insurer, chose to test 
innovation and workforce development as a pathway to long-term improvement in 
population health. Building in part on the CommunityRx project, the CMMI Accountable 
Health Communities opportunity will invest $157 million over 5 years to accelerate 
development of cross-sector delivery models for addressing beneficiary health-related social 
needs.17 The Health Care Innovation Award anticipated “locally driven innovations.”18 In 
our community, we believe successful strategies for an enduring culture of health will be 
those that center on whole people (rather than diseases), engage youth, and generate value 
across sectors by creating meaningful, health-promoting data and jobs.7

 physician trained at site #1 to use CommunityRx “hacked” the system to function at another 
site where he worked. This unexpected spread prompted us to expand CommunityRx 
prescribing functionality to all affiliated clinical sites providing care for patients who were 
residents in the implementation geography. aClinical sites included 27 Federally Qualified 
Health Centers (5 of these were school-based clinics) operated by 5 corporations, and 6 
academic medical center-affiliated sites (4 outpatient practices and an adult and pediatric 
emergency department). Sites are numbered in order of deployment. bEnglish and Spanish-
speaking CHIS were deployed at partnering community-based organizations (organizations 
1–4) and with the central team (organization 5).

NOTES Data presented are limited to 10 ZIP codes with resource inventory survey data available from the start of our survey activities. Therefore, the estimated total participants receiving a HealtheRx 
months 9 to 35 and the population characteristics reflect those for the 10 ZIP code subset. For the 16 ZIP code region, total population 975,400, an estimated 113,295 participants received a HealtheRx 
months 9 to 35.
aCounts and percentages of individuals living below FPL (federal poverty level) are based on the number of individuals for whom poverty level could be determined: this includes university students living 
off campus (N=511,967).
bCounts and percentages of uninsured individuals includes only civilian, non-institutionalized individuals (N=517,559).
cCounts and percentages for unemployment includes only those 16 years and older (N=403,857).
