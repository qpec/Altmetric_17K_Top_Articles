We describe the biological effects of a polyphenol-rich strawberry extract (PRSE), obtained from the 
“Alba” variety, on the highly aggressive and invasive basal-like breast cancer cell line A17. Dose-response 
 
and time-course experiments showed that PRSE is able to decrease the cellular viability of A17 cells in 
a time- and dose-dependent manner. PRSE effect on cell survival was investigated in other tumor and 
normal cell lines of both mouse and human origin, demonstrating that PRSE is more active against 
breast cancer cells. Cytofluorimetric analysis of A17 cells demonstrated that sub-lethal doses of PRSE 
reduce the number of cells in S phase, inducing the accumulation of cells in G1 phase of cell cycle. 
In addition, the migration of A17 cells was studied monitoring the ability of PRSE to inhibit cellular 
mobility. Gene expression analysis revealed the modulation of 12 genes playing different roles in the 
cellular migration, adhesion and invasion processes. Finally, in vivo experiments showed the growth 
inhibition of A17 cells orthotopically transplanted into FVB syngeneic mice fed with PRSE. Overall, we 
demonstrated that PRSE exerts important biological activities against a highly invasive breast cancer 
cell line both in vitro and in vivo suggesting the strawberry extracts as preventive/curative food strategy.
In the last decades, the ability of phytochemicals to modulate apoptosis signaling pathways has attracted increas-
ing attention as an anti-cancer agent1. The richest dietary sources of these bioactive compounds are fruits and 
vegetables, and their intake has been correlated with a decreased risk of developing several chronic pathologies, 
including cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases2,3, obesity4, diabetes5, infections6, skin diseases7 and 
cancer8, including breast cancer9.
Among fruits, there is growing interest in berries, and in particular strawberries (Fragaria x ananassa Duch.), 
due to their nutritional quality and to the numerous bioactive compounds they contain10. Compared with other 
non-berry fruits, the strawberry is a rich source of folate11, vitamin C and several phytochemicals that can influ-
ence the nutritional and organoleptic qualities of this fruit12,13. Its healthy effects are attributed to high levels 
of antioxidant compounds, most of which are phenolic compounds such as anthocyanins, flavonols, flavanols, 
condensed tannins (proanthocyanidins, ellagitannins, and gallotannins), hydroxybenzoic and hydroxycinnamic 
acid derivatives, and hydrolyzable tannins13,14. The role of strawberry bioactive compounds on cancer prevention 
seems to involve different mechanisms, which have not yet been fully elucidated; therefore, further investigations

are needed to clarify the roles of the different strawberries phytochemicals against cancer cells. Several studies 
on extracts of strawberries, raspberries, and other fruits and berries, did not found any correlations between the 
content of some phytochemicals and inhibition of cancer cell proliferation15,16. Different studies indeed have 
shown that the complex mixtures of phytochemicals present in fruits and vegetables are more effective than their 
individual constituents in preventing cancer, through both additive and synergistic effects17,18. For this reason, 
it is important to study potential anticancer activity of fruits and vegetables using whole extracts containing all 
phytochemicals, not only using purified molecules or fractions enriched in certain classes of molecules.
The antioxidant capacity has been considered for years as a first line defense against the earlier stages of the 
mutagenesis process, through the capacity of these compounds to scavenge ROS species decreasing DNA oxi-
dative damage, to stimulate antioxidant enzymes and to enhance DNA repairing. Several studies have recently 
underlined the ability of these compounds to modulate the cellular processes linked to cancer progression, such 
as cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, intracellular communication, inflammation and 
angiogenesis. Nevertheless, only few studies exist on the anticancer effect of strawberries and, in particular, 
against breast cancer19. Breast cancer represents the most common neoplastic disease among women worldwide, 
with about 1.67 million new cancer cases in 2012 (25% of all cancers), and is the second leading cause of cancer 
death among women in developed regions (198,000 dead, 15.4%)20.
Evidence supports the idea that tumor growth, recurrence and metastasis formation are dependent on cells 
with self-renewal properties, termed cancer initiating cells (CICs) or cancer stem cells (CSCs)21. A17 cells are 
a highly tumorigenic and invasive cell line, established from an FVB/neuT transgenic mammary tumor, dis-
playing properties of CICs and basal-like breast cancer22–26. It has been demonstrated that A17 cells exhibit a 
stemness-related gene signature virtually identical to that of mesenchymal stem cells and are able to induce sec-
ondary tumor lesions due to metastasis formation25. In this study we investigated the biological activity of “Alba” 
strawberry extract on breast cancer, with a particular focus on the A17 cellular model.
Results
Phytochemical analysis of PRSE. 
The nutritional and phytochemical composition of PRSE was char-
acterized by analyzing vitamin C content, phytochemical levels and the total antioxidant capacity (TAC) of the 
extract. Results are reported in Table 1 and show, according to our previous studies27, that “
Alba” extract presents 
high levels of Vitamin C (0.57 mg/g) and phytochemical compounds measured as Total Phenolic Content (TPH) 
(2.26 mg GAEq/g), Total Flavonoids Content (TFC) (0.61 mg CEq/g) and Total Anthocyanin Content (ACY) 
(0.46 mg Pg-glcEq/g).
However, TFC and ACY values are similar to those of other strawberry cultivars, while the level of total phe-
nolic compounds results very high if compared to commercial strawberry varieties previously analyzed27,28.
Moreover, the total antioxidant capacity of PRSE was quantified showing relevant values by both Trolox 
Equivalent Antioxidant Capacity (TEAC) (17.97 μ 
mol TE/g) and Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Power (FRAP) 
(12.62 μ 
mol TE/g) assays (Table 1).
Biological effects of PRSE on A17 cells. 
The effects induced by the extract on the survival of A17 cells 
were analyzed in both dose-response and time-course experiments. Cells were treated for 24 h, 48 h or 72 h with 
concentrations of extract ranging from 0.5 to 5 mg/ml. Interestingly, we found that the extract reduces the sur-
vival of A17 cells in a time and dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1a).
Once characterized in A17 cells, the activity of PRSE was investigated also in normal fibroblast cell lines of both 
murine (NIH-3T3) and human (WI38) origin and in the human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 by dose-response 
studies at 48 h of treatment. Interestingly, we found that: i) A17 cells show the higher response to PRSE exposure 
(IC50 of 1.14 ± 
 0.29 mg/ml) and, most importantly, that ii) normal cells are significantly less sensitive to PRSE 
respect to cancer cell lines (mean IC50 of 3.24 ± 0.14 mg/ml and 1.68 ± 0.77 mg/ml, respectively – Fig. 1b).
Subsequently, possible alterations of cell cycle phase distribution were evaluated by cytofluorimetric analysis 
of propidium iodide stained cells. A17 cells treated for 48 h with different concentrations of PRSE showed, at the 
concentrations of 0.5 and 1 mg/ml of PRSE treatments, a reduction of cells in S phase and a concomitant increase 
of cells in G1 phase of the cell cycle (Fig. 2). Moreover, treatments with higher doses of PRSE (2.5 mg/ml) drasti-
cally change the biological response of A17 cells, hindering the cell cycle analysis but showing the appearance of 
a hypodiploid cellular subpopulation (Fig. 3).
A17 cell line is an intriguing model of study because of its highly aggressive and invasive phenotype25. In 
consideration of the critical role of cellular migration on the multistep process of tissue invasion29 we decided

to investigate the possible interference of PRSE on the mobility of A17 cells by wounding assay. To avoid cell 
turnover that could mimic the cell migration, cells were starved during this assay. After 48 h of culture, A17 cells 
not subjected to treatments were able to migrate and partially fill the wound empty area while exposure to PRSE 
inhibited the cell migration in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4a). Notably, the inhibition of wound closure was 
monitored starting from the lowest concentration of PRSE tested (0.5 mg/ml), and appears almost completely 
inhibited starting from a concentration of 2.5 mg/ml (Fig. 4a). A quantitative analysis of wound closure was car-
ried out using the NIH Image J software (Fig. 4b).
PRSE modulation of gene expression. 
The biological effects mediated by the extract on A17 cells were 
also investigated at the molecular level by analyzing the expression of a panel of genes known to be involved, 
with different roles, in the cellular migration, adhesion and invasion processes. For this purpose, the level of 84 
different mouse gene transcripts was analyzed by applying a quantitative RT-PCR array on A17 cells untreated 
or treated for 48 h with sub-lethal doses of PRSE. Among the 84 gene transcripts screened, 12 genes showed 
a regulation exceeding the 2-fold criteria compared to the untreated control (Fig. 5a). Genes down-regulated 
include the colony stimulating factor 1 (Csf1, − 
2.42 fold), the melanoma cell adhesion molecule (Mcam, − 
2.78 
fold), the nuclear receptor subfamily 4, group A, member 3 (Nr4a3, − 
4.42 fold) and SET nuclear proto-oncogene 
(SET, − 
3.38 fold). The transcripts showing the strongest up-regulation were glycoprotein nmb (Gpnmb, 4.30 
fold), Integrin beta 3 (Itgb3, 2.97 fold) and the chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 7 (CCl7, 2.89 fold). In addition, 
also cathepsin L (Ctsl, 2.37 fold), chemokine (C-X-C motif) Receptor 4 (Cxcr4, 2.14 fold), HIV-1 tat interactive

protein 2 (Htatip2, 2.14 fold), and matrix metalloproteinases 10 and 3 (Mmp10 and Mmp3, 2.62 and 2.61 fold, 
respectively) showed an up-regulation exceeding the 2-fold criteria. Notably, 18 out of 84 transcripts present in 
the PCR array were not amplified (see legend of Fig. 5a).
Subsequently, two genes showing significant modulation, Mcam and Nr4a3, were further investigated at pro-
tein level by western blotting (Fig. 5b). Densitometric analysis of the bands of the two proteins was performed 
and normalized to alpha-tubulin expression, confirming the downregulation of Mcam (− 
1.89 fold at 0.5 mg/ml 
and − 
4.25 fold at 1 mg/ml of extract) and, at a less extent, of Nr4a3 (− 
2.37 fold at 0.5 mg/ml and − 
1.54 fold at 
1 mg/ml of extract). In addition, caspase-1 levels were also analyzed by western blotting showing the upregulation 
of the protein at both 0.5 mg/ml (+ 
1.89 fold) and 1 mg/ml (+ 
4.16 fold) of PRSE (Fig. 5b).
In vivo evaluation of PRSE activity. 
A17 cells were used to generate an orthotopic model of breast cancer 
in syngeneic female FVB/N mice. Four weeks mice were fed with 15% strawberry extract-enriched food or reg-
ular food as control (ten mice for each group). Upon the 8th week of age, all the mice underwent tumor challenge 
while animals of each group continued to receive their diets. After 5 weeks, tumors were withdrawn, measured 
using a caliper and weighted. Results show a significant reduction in both tumor weight (Fig. 6a) and tumor vol-
ume (Fig. 6b) in mice fed with PRSE.
Discussion
The strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa) was chosen as the model in this study for its high content of antioxidants 
and bioactive compounds, as well as for its high availability for food industry and fresh consumption13. In the last 
decades, growing interest has been focused on the antioxidant capacity of strawberries so that TAC is considered 
a quality parameter and an indicator of bioactive compounds present in the fruit. The antioxidant capacity of the

strawberry indicates that its consumption could contribute to prevent and reduce oxidative reactions that cause 
negative effects on human health, playing different roles in the development of chronic diseases and cancers.
Moreover, even if the high TAC of strawberries has been proved, it has also been demonstrated that this 
parameter is strongly influenced by the strawberry genetic background and is strictly related to the presence 
of oxygen radical scavengers such as Vitamin C and polyphenols11,27,28,30,31. Among polyphenols, anthocyanins 
are quantitatively the most important phenolic compounds in strawberries13, so that more than 25 different

anthocyanin pigments have been described from different varieties and selections32. Analyses of TPH, ACY and 
TFC in the “
Alba” cultivar in the present study confirm the high content of phytochemicals of this strawberry.
Strawberries are important also for their high content of Vitamin C, which is even higher than that of 
 
citrus fruit. Vitamin C content is an essential parameter due to the high number of biological roles that it plays 
in humans, lowering the incidence of cardio-and cerebro-vascular diseases33, of several cancers34, and other 
health disorders such as lead toxicity35. When evaluating the Vitamin C content in strawberries, it is important to 
 
consider that the molecule is very labile and in adverse conditions undergoes oxidation, depending on several 
factors such as temperature, water and pH36.
The choice of using “
Alba” strawberries in this study was also based on the very interesting results obtained in 
recent years using this cultivar, both in vitro37,38 and in vivo39,40.
As shown above, the “Alba” strawberry extract is able to strongly decrease cellular viability of the highly 
tumorigenic stromal cell line A17, which is characterized by mesenchymal features and metastasis formation 
ability26,41.

In particular, it is possible to distinguish two different biological behaviors: i) a cytostatic-like effect at low 
doses of PRSE and ii) an acute toxic effect at higher doses. The capacity of the strawberry extract to activate the 
apoptotic process, as well as its anti-cancer potential in other cancer models, was already characterized by other 
authors19. However, although these observations are in accordance with the increased hypodiploidy observed in 
this study at high PRSE doses, the analysis of DNA fragmentation by laddering assay did not show the induction 
of the apoptotic internucleosomic cleavage of DNA (data not shown). Interestingly, we observed an increased 
expression level of the precursor form of caspase-1 that, together with the monitored hypodiploidy, could suggest 
an activation of the apoptotic pathway at a very early stage, and thus below the detection limit of the experimental 
approaches used. In addition, we found no evidence of caspase-3 modulation and/or activation (data not shown).

We hypothesized that sub-lethal doses of strawberry extract could be able to inhibit the known invasive poten-
tial of A17 breast cancer cells. Thus, the effect of PRSE on the cellular migration, which is known to play a pivotal 
role in invasion, was first analyzed at a biological level by wounding healing assay. The observation that low doses 
of “Alba” PRSE were sufficient to block cell migration gave us the rationale to extend the study at the molecular 
level. The subsequent characterization of the expression levels of genes involved in the cellular migration, adhe-
sion and invasion processes allowed us to obtain an overall view of changes that take place in several pathways. In 
particular, the down-regulation of a subgroup of genes (Csf1, Mcam, Nr4a3 and Set) supports the anti-invasion 
effect of the PRSE extract because high expression levels of these genes are often associated to the invasive phe-
notype of cells. In the context of human breast cancer it has been already reported that: i) high expression of Csf1 
is correlated to metastasis formation and thus has been proposed as negative prognostic factor; ii) up-regulation 
of human Mcam (named Muc18 in humans) promotes motility, invasiveness and tumorigenesis of human breast 
cancer cells; iii) high expression levels of Nr4a3 were found correlated with increased risk of developing distant 
metastasis in triple-negative breast cancer patients; iv) Set nuclear proto-oncogene (named also I2pp2a) is one 
of the genes down-regulated by the mushroom Ganoderma lucidum extract and is involved in the suppression of 
breast-to-lung cancer metastasis42–45. Interestingly, the modulation of Mcam and Nr4a3 was confirmed also at the 
protein level, further suggesting a role of these proteins in the effect induced by PRSE on A17 cells.
Likewise, we found two genes whose monitored up-regulation, as a consequence of PRSE treatment, can 
be consistent with an anti-invasion effect: i) Htatip2 (named also Tip30), a putative metastasis suppressor gene 
which is inversely correlated with lymph node metastasis in breast cancer patients, and ii) Gpnmb (also named 
Osteoactivin/HGFIN), a gene with a controversial role in the metastatic process46,47.
Otherwise, it was not possible to find any correlation between the known activity of the remaining six genes 
found up-regulated by PRSE (Ccl7, Ctsl, Cxcr4, Itgb3, Mmp19, Mmp3) since their functions are generally associ-
ated to the acquisition of invasive features44,48–51.
As already stated, the role of strawberry bioactive compounds on cancer prevention seems to involve different 
mechanisms of action that are still unclear. Previous studies indeed indicate that the biological activity exerted 
by berries against cancer cells is probably mediated by the synergy between different compounds suggesting the 
involvement of several molecular pathways. To date, only few studies have tried to investigate the molecular basis 
of strawberry activity against breast cancer cells. For example, the role of p73 in triggering apoptosis of p53-null 
cells has been recently suggested19. Our study indicates the involvement of other genes known to play key roles in 
cellular invasion, adhesion and migration.
Notably, cell survival studies show that the effect of the extract is significantly higher in breast cancer cell lines, 
and in particular A17 cells, with respect to normal cells, suggesting a therapeutic window for PRSE in vivo. This 
observation is in accordance with previous studies on mice that showed efficacy of strawberry methanolic extract 
against Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (EAC)19. We thus explored the efficacy of PRSE in inhibiting tumor formation 
in vivo exploiting the intriguing orthotopic breast cancer model generated by injection of A17 cells directly into 
the mammary gland of mice, finding a strong reduction of both tumor size and tumor volume in mice fed with 
PRSE from 4 weeks before tumor challenge.
Although the mechanism by which the strawberry extract exerts its biological effect is not completely under-
stood at the molecular level, as well as which component plays the major antineoplastic role, our results suggest 
an interesting anti-invasive potential of “Alba” PRSE against breast cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. Further 
studies will be necessary to unravel the pathways involved in the biological effects of PRSE and to elucidate the 
molecular basis of strawberry extract action, as well as to shed light on the possible introduction in the diet of 
“
Alba” and, more in general, strawberries as a useful nutrient to limit (or prevent) tumor formation.
Methods
Preparation of PRSE. 
Strawberry fruits of the “Alba” variety were collected in the experimental fields of 
the Agricultural Faculty of “Università Politecnica delle Marche” located in Agugliano (AN), in central east Italy 
(43°31′ 
60″ 
 N-13°22′ 
60″ 
 E). Fruit samples from the selected variety were hand-picked at the same day-time on 
different days, corresponding to the ripening times of the selected clone, from the second to the fourth picking. 
Fruit samples were selected for homogenous fruit, avoiding unripe, wounded or shriveled fruits. Within 2 h after 
harvest, whole fruits were stored at − 
20 °C before analyses. For the evaluation of total antioxidant capacity (TAC), 
total phenolic content (TPH), total anthocyanin content (ACY) and total flavonoid content (TFC), a methanolic 
extract was prepared via homogenization. Frozen strawberries were thawed for 60 min at 4 °C. Ten gram aliquots 
of the fruits were added to 100 mL of the extraction solution, consisting of methanol/milliQ water/concentrated 
formic acid (80:20:0.1 v/v), and fruits were homogenized using an Ultraturrax T25 homogeniser (Janke & Kunkel, 
IKA Labortechnik, Staufen, Germany) for 2 min. Extraction was maximized by stirring the suspension for 2 h in 
the dark at room temperature (RT), then the tubes were centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 15 min, in two sequential 
times, to sediment solids. Supernatants were filtered through a 0.45 μ 
m Minisart filter (PBI International, Milan, 
Italy), transferred to 5.0 ml amber glass vials and stored at –20 °C until analysis. Methanolic extract was concen-
trated through a rotary evaporator and stored in aliquots at − 
80 °C for subsequent experimental procedures. 
Vitamin C analysis was conducted as described28.
PRSE analysis. 
Two methods were used for the determination of the antioxidant capacity (TAC) of straw-
berry extracts: the Trolox Equivalent Antioxidant Capacity (TEAC) and the Ferric Reducing Antioxidant 
Power (FRAP). TEAC assay consists in the quantification of strawberry extract free radical scavenging activity 
against 2,2-azinobis-(3-ethylbenz-thiazoline-6-sulfonate) radical cation (ABTS+), using Trolox (6-Hydroxy-
2,5,7,8-tetramethylchroman-2-carboxylic acid) as reference standard52,53. Briefly, 1 ml of the ABTS+ radical solu-
tion was mixed with 10 μ 
l of reagent (strawberry extract or standard). The analysis solution was vortexed for 
20 seconds and, after 1–3 min, spectrophotometrically analyzed at 734 nm measuring the color inhibition of the

ABTS+ radical. FRAP assay was carried out according to the protocol proposed by Deighton and coworkers54, 
with slight modifications55.
Total phenolic content (TPH) of the strawberry extracts was determined using the Folin-Ciocalteu colori-
metric method, as modified by Slinkard and Singleton56. Briefly, 100 μ 
L of sample (milliQ water, water diluted 
strawberry extracts or gallic acid standard solutions) were added to 500 μ 
L of Folin-Ciocalteau reagent previously 
diluted in water (dil. 1/10) and kept at 4 °C, in the dark. The mixture was incubated for 1 to 8 min at RT, then 400 μ 
L 
of 0.7 M sodium carbonate were added and the mixture was vortexed. The solution was incubated for 2 h at RT, in 
the dark and spectrophotometrically analyzed at 760 nm.
The total anthocyanin (ACY) content of the strawberry extracts was determined using a modified pH differen-
tial method57, while total flavonoid content (TFC) was determined by using a colorimetric method58,59.
Vitamin C content was measured through HPLC analysis immediately after the extraction procedure. The 
HPLC system comprised a Jasco (Jasco Inc., Easton, USA) PU-2089 Plus controller and a Jasco UV-2070 Plus 
ultraviolet (UV) detector set at absorbance of 260 nm. An isocratic elution with 50 mM potassium phosphate at 
pH 3.2 was performed by means of a Supelcosil LC8 150 × 
 4.6 mm HPLC column (Sigma-Aldrich S.r.l. Milan, 
Italy)60. Quantification of the vitamin C was carried out through a comparison with pure vitamin C calibration 
curve. All the analyses were conducted in triplicate.
Cell culture. 
The stromal cell line A17 was isolated from a murine model of mammary carcinoma induced 
by the overexpression of HER-2/neu transgene in the epithelial compartment of mammary glands in FVB mice, 
line 23325. A17 cells were cultured in high-glucose Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM - Euroclone, 
Pero, Italy), supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (Gibco - Hyclone, South Logan, UT, USA), 1% 
penicillin-streptomycin and 1% glutamine.
WI38, NIH-3T3 and MCF-7 cell lines were kindly provided by Prof. Pier Giuseppe Pelicci (European Institute 
of Oncology - Milan, Italy, 2016) and cultured in high-glucose Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM - 
Euroclone, Pero, Italy), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco - Hyclone, South Logan, UT, USA), 
1% penicillin-streptomycin and 1% glutamine.
All the cell lines were grown in a humidified atmosphere at 37 °C and 5% CO2 as previously described61,62.
Cell viability. 
Dried PRSE, stored in aliquots at − 
80 °C, was diluted in culture medium immediately before 
use. Cells were seeded in triplicate in 6-well plates 16 hours before PRSE addition. After treatment with different 
concentrations of extract, cell viability was measured by a TC10 automatic cell counter (BioRad, Hercules, CA, 
USA) and compared with an untreated control to estimate the cell viability. The 50% inhibitory concentration 
(IC50) value was calculated with CompuSyn software (ComboSyn, Inc., Paramus, NJ, USA)63. Data are reported 
as mean (± 
SD) resulting from three independent experiments.
Cell cycle analysis. 
Cell cycle was analyzed using the propidium iodide staining procedure as previ-
ously reported64. Cells were fixed in ice-cold 70% ethanol and stained using a propidium iodide staining solu-
tion (50 mg/ml). Cytofluorimetric acquisitions were carried out with a PAS flow cytometer (Partec, Münster, 
Germany) and sample analysis conducted using FlowJo 8.6.3 software (Tree Star, Inc., Ashland, OR, USA). Cell 
cycle percentage values were calculated using a Watson pragmatic model.
Wounding assay. 
Wounding assay was performed as previously described on the same cellular model 
(A17)65. Briefly, a linear wound was produced in A17 confluent cellular population by scratching the bottom of 
each dish with a sterile pipette tip. After wounding, cells were washed with phosphate buffer saline (PBS) and 
incubated in high glucose DMEM containing 0.5% FBS with different strawberry extract concentrations (0.5, 1, 
2.5 and 5 mg/ml). A17 cells were allowed to migrate for additional 48 h after which images acquisition was carried 
out by a LeitzFluovert FU (Leica Microsystems) microscope. Remaining wound areas were determined using 
NIH Image J software for calculation of the percentage of wound closure. Analyses were performed in triplicate.
Gene expression analysis and western blotting. 
The Tumor Metastasis RT2 Profiler PCR Array 
(Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), consisting of 84 mouse genes known to be involved in the metastasis formation pro-
cess, was used to profile the biological response of A17 cells induced by the PRSE. Briefly, total RNA was extracted 
from treated or untreated A17 cells using RNeasy extraction kit and reverse transcribed into cDNA using an 
RT2 First Strand Kit (Qiagen). The cDNA was combined with RT2 SYBR Green qPCR Master Mix (Qiagen), and 
equally distributed (25 μ 
l) to each well of the PCR array plate. Real-time PCR assay and subsequent data collection 
were performed on a Rotor-Gene 6000 robocycler (Corbett Life Science, Sydney, Australia)66. Transcript relative 
enrichments were calculated following manufacturer’s instructions (Qiagen). Experiments were performed in 
triplicate.
Western blotting analyses were performed as previously described66 using anti-CD146 (Mcam - #ab75769, 
lot #GR208953-3 from Abcam), anti-NOR-1 (Nr4a3 - #sc-133840, lot #G1911 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology), 
anti-Caspase-1 (#66441A from Pharmingen International) and anti-α 
Tubulin (#T9026, lot #057K4842 from 
Sigma) antibodies. Goat anti-rabbit IgG, horseradish peroxidase conjugate (#G21234, lot #35837A) and goat 
anti-mouse IgG, horseradish peroxidase conjugate (#G21040, lot #83E1-1) were purchased from Molecular 
Probes. Elaboration of pictures and densitometric analysis were performed using ImageJ software (ImageJ 1.43u; 
National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA). The data obtained by the densitometric analysis were normal-
ized to alpha-tubulin protein levels and expressed as fold changes.
In vivo evaluation of PRSE efficacy. 
Four weeks old female FVB/N mice were obtained from Animal 
Care Facilities of the University of Camerino. Ten mice (fed with 15% strawberry extract-enriched food) were

housed one mouse/cage, while ten mice (fed with regular food) were housed in two cages with free access to water 
and food, and kept at temperature of 19–22 °C and relative humidity of 45–65% under 12 h/12 h light/dark cycle. 
Upon the 8th week of age, all the mice were orthotopically injected with 2 × 105 A17 cells. Tumor monitoring was 
performed twice a week by palpation. After 5 weeks, the tumors were analyzed, after resection, evaluating both 
weight and volume (two perpendicular diameters - a and b - on each tumor were measured using a caliper and the 
volumes were calculated by the V = π 
/6[(a + b)/2]3 formula). All the experimental procedures carried out in this 
study were in compliance with the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 and associated guidelines, EU 
Directive 2010/63/EU, and were approved by the Ethic Committee on Animal Use of the University of Camerino 
(protocol number 14/2012).
