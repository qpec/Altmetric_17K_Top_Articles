Abstract
Background
High body mass index (BMI) is an important contributor to the global burden of ill-health and
health inequality. Lower socioeconomic position (SEP) in both childhood and adulthood is
associated with higher adult BMI, but how these associations have changed across time is
poorly understood. We used longitudinal data to examine how childhood and adult SEP
relates to BMI across adulthood in three national British birth cohorts.
Methods and Findings
The sample comprised up to 22,810 participants with 77,115 BMI observations in the 1946
MRC National Survey of Health and Development (ages 20 to 60–64), the 1958 National
Child Development Study (ages 23 to 50), and the 1970 British Cohort Study (ages 26 to
42). Harmonized social class-based SEP data (Registrar General’s Social Class) was
ascertained in childhood (father’s class at 10/11 y) and adulthood (42/43 years), and BMI
repeatedly across adulthood, spanning 1966 to 2012. Associations between SEP and BMI
were examined using linear regression and multilevel models.
Lower childhood SEP was associated with higher adult BMI in both genders, and differ-
ences were typically larger at older ages and similar in magnitude in each cohort. The
strength of association between adult SEP and BMI did not vary with age in any consistent
pattern in these cohorts, but were more evident in women than men, and inequalities were
larger among women in the 1970 cohort compared with earlier-born cohorts. For example,
mean differences in BMI at 42/43 y amongst women in the lowest compared with highest
social class were 2.0 kg/m2 (95% CI: −0.1, 4.0) in the 1946 NSHD, 2.3 kg/m2 (1.1, 3.4) in the
1958 NCDS, and 3.9 kg/m2 (2.3, 5.4) the in the 1970 BCS; mean (SD) BMI in the highest
and lowest social classes were as follows: 24.9 (0.8) versus 26.8 (0.7) in the 1946 NSHD,

Limitations of this work include the use of social class as the sole indicator of SEP—while
it was available in each cohort in both childhood and adulthood, trends in BMI inequalities
may differ according to other dimensions of SEP such as education or income. Although
harmonized data were used to aid inferences about birth cohort differences in BMI inequal-
ity, differences in other factors may have also contributed to findings—for example, differ-
ences in missing data.
Conclusions
Given these persisting inequalities and their public health implications, new and effective
policies to reduce inequalities in adult BMI that tackle inequality with respect to both child-
hood and adult SEP are urgently required
Author Summary
Why Was This Study Done?
• High body mass index (BMI) is thought to be harmful to human health—in most adults,
a high BMI is due to having high amounts of fat mass in the body.
• Previous studies have found that those with fewer socioeconomic resources—both as
children and as adults—are more likely, on average, to have a higher BMI as adults.
• Reducing these socioeconomic inequalities in BMI is an important health policy goal,
yet there is limited existing data to help us understand comprehensively how these
inequalities have changed across time.
What Did the Researchers Do and Find?
• We used data from three national British birth cohort studies of those born in 1946,
1958, and 1970—these studies contain comparable data on social class in childhood and
adulthood, and on BMI across adult life.
• We confirm that large inequalities in BMI exist, according to both childhood and adult
SEP—these were stronger among women, but also found among men.
• Inequalities according to childhood SEP generally become progressively larger at older
ages in all cohorts and in both genders; inequalities according to adult SEP were larger
among more recently born generations of women.
What Do These Findings Mean?
• The fact that BMI inequalities have persisted or increased across different generations,
despite policies designed to reduce them, suggests that new policies are required.

 • Results support the need to intervene earlier rather than later in adult life, since inequal-
ities tend to become larger at older ages.
• Limitations include the use of only one aspect of socioeconomic circumstances (social
class), and the fact that not all participants continue to provide data in longitudinal stud-
ies—this may have led us to underestimating the size of BMI inequalities.
Introduction
High body mass index (BMI) is an important modifiable contributor to the global burden of
ill-health and health expenditure,[1, 2] and its prevalence increased markedly between the
1980s and 2014.[3–5] National attempts to reduce population BMI levels have thus far largely
been unsuccessful,[3–5] suggesting that it is likely to be an important threat to the health of
future generations.[3] Indeed, the increasing prevalence of high BMI at younger ages suggests
that later-born generations are at risk of spending longer periods of life either overweight or
obese.[6] Systematic reviews have also shown that in high income countries, lower socioeco-
nomic position (SEP) in childhood and adulthood are associated with higher adult BMI and
increased obesity risk.[7–9] Due to the links between higher BMI and adverse health out-
comes,[10, 11] inequalities in BMI are likely to be an important contributor to socioeconomic
inequalities in health. Accordingly, reducing BMI inequalities is a stated goal of numerous
health policymakers and organizations; [12] achieving this requires high-quality evidence on
how such inequalities have changed across time, in response to changing policy and economic
contexts.
Existing evidence on how inequalities in BMI have changed across generations is largely
restricted to repeated analyses of cross-sectional data.[13–21] These studies have tended to
report persisting inequalities in BMI that are stronger among women, yet are limited to inves-
tigating relatively recent changes (e.g., from 1993/1994 to 2002/2003,[13] or 1994 to 2008[14]).
They also do not elucidate how inequalities in BMI change with age; understanding these pat-
terns may help inform the development of interventions targeted at the most effective ages.
Such differences may reflect age differences in susceptibility to weight gain, which in turn may
differ by cohort depending on the period of life when exposed to more obesogenic environ-
ments. The use of repeated cross-sectional adult data also leads to an almost exclusive focus on
the changing consequences of adult SEP in previous studies, since such studies do not have (by
design) prospective measures of childhood SEP. However, childhood socioeconomic circum-
stances strongly determine those in adulthood, and childhood SEP has been repeatedly related
to higher adult adiposity and other health outcomes independent of adult SEP.[22–27] Rela-
tions between childhood SEP and adult BMI are also less likely to be affected by reverse causa-
tion than those with adult SEP, since obesity may impair adult economic outcomes;[28–31]
childhood SEP is therefore an important dimension of socioeconomic circumstances to con-
sider when understanding how inequalities have changed across time. Many previous studies
have not investigated inequality on both relative (e.g., % change) and absolute (difference in
kg/m2) scales. Since changes in relative inequality can occur despite opposing or no changes in
absolute inequality, particularly when dichotomized outcomes are used and the overall popula-
tion outcome prevalence changes, analyzing both is likely to be important in order to better
understand how inequalities have changed across time, and their population health impact.
[32, 33] To our knowledge, the literature currently lacks a comprehensive coordinated analysis

 to investigate how inequalities in BMI across adulthood have changed over the course of the
obesity epidemic, with respect to both childhood and adult SEP.
The objectives of this study were to examine trends in the socioeconomic distribution of
BMI and overweight or obesity across adult life, using data from the British birth cohort stud-
ies initiated in 1946, 1958, and 1970. These data have previously been used to show that the
obesity epidemic has hit more recently born generations at increasingly younger ages in adult-
hood;[6] as with evidence from repeated cross-sectional studies,[4] this paper found that obe-
sity prevalence increased markedly from the 1980s onwards in the United Kingdom and
remained persistently high up to 2012. We use data collected between 1966 and 2012, which
covers this period. Consistent with a fundamental cause hypothesis for understanding health
inequality,[34, 35] we expected that due to the increasing public dissemination of the health
harms of obesity, those of higher SEP may have been increasingly able to use their greater
social, financial, and educational resources to protect themselves against excessive weight gain
across adulthood; principally by modifying their diet and/or physical activity levels. As such,
we hypothesized that socioeconomic inequalities in BMI would be larger in cohorts born later
in the 20th century, and that these differences would be evident for both childhood and adult
SEP.
Methods
Study samples
Each study used in this manuscript has received relevant ethical approval and obtained paren-
tal/participant consent; this information is available from the study websites and/or cohort
profiles.
Britain’s birth cohort studies with participants followed up through adulthood were used.
These were designed to be nationally representative when initiated in 1946 (MRC National
Survey of Health and Development[36, 37]—1946 NSHD), 1958 (National Child Development
Study[38]—1958 NCDS), and 1970 (British Cohort Study[39]—1970 BCS). The history,
design, and characteristics of these studies have been previously described in detail in papers
[36–40] and books;[41, 42] studies have also examined the characteristics of those lost due to
attrition.[43–46] To aid the comparability of associations between SEP and BMI across studies,
analyses were restricted to singleton births in England, Scotland, and Wales from those born
and included in cohorts in the relevant weeks in March/April 1946 (N = 5,362), 1958
(N = 16,383), and 1970 (N = 16,172). In the 1946 NSHD, participants were restricted to those
from married mothers due to tracing difficulties in the minority of babies born to unmarried
mothers.[40] The weeks of initiation were chosen on the basis of practical considerations at
the time of study development. The analytic sample sizes were those with valid data for each
SEP measure and at least one adult BMI measure; for childhood SEP, a total of 22,810 partici-
pants with 77,115 BMI observations; for adult SEP, a total of 17,898 participants with 36,702
BMI observations (sample sizes for all analyses, in each cohort, age, and gender are shown in
Table 1 and Table 2, and in S1 Table and S2 Table). All participants in the 1946 NSHD were
white, as were 98.7% of those in the 1958 NCDS, and 95.4% of 1970 BCS. All analyses using
the 1946 NSHD were weighted to account for the stratified sampling design[37].
BMI measurement
BMI (kg/m2), the main outcome measure, was derived in each study from measured or self-
reported weight and height obtained at all available adulthood ages: 1946 NSHD: 20�, 26�, 36,
43, 53, and 60–64 y; 1958 NCDS: 23�, 33, 42�, 44, and 50� y; 1970 BCS: 26�, 30�, 34�, and 42� y
(�self-report). The main protocol differences and methods used to harmonize height and

 weight have been described elsewhere.[6] Briefly, all measures were converted to metric units,
women were excluded when pregnant (N = 257 (1946), 684 (1958), 110 (1970)), and a stan-
dardized cleaning process was used to remove participants with implausible values.
SEP ascertainment
Indicators of SEP in childhood and adulthood were derived in each cohort—the main expo-
sures in this study. Social class measures were used, since comparable measures were available
in both childhood and adulthood, and in each cohort. Childhood SEP was indicated by father’s
occupational social class, measured at 10/11 y, and adult SEP by own occupational social class

 measured at 42/43 y. To aid comparability of results across cohorts, the Registrar General’s
Social Class was used to classify social class—from I (professional), II (managerial and techni-
cal), IIIN (skilled nonmanual), IIIM (skilled manual), IV (partly-skilled), and V (unskilled)
occupations. The 1990 classification schema was used for childhood and adult SEP in all
cohorts, and (due to a lack of conversion schema) the 1970 version was used for childhood
SEP in the 1946 NSHD. Those in the armed forces were not assigned a social class, nor those
not employed.
Analytical strategy
DB, RH, WJ, LL, and DK determined which analyses to perform and include in the paper in
August 2016. Following request from peer review, we conducted additional analyses in Octo-
ber 2016 to examine the extent to which associations between childhood SEP and BMI were
explained by adult SEP, and to examine in greater detail the characteristics of those with miss-
ing data.
SEP differences in BMI. We derived mean BMI (and standard error [SE]) at each age for
each childhood and adult SEP group, separately for each cohort and gender. To assess absolute
inequalities in BMI at each age for childhood and adult SEP, we applied linear regression mod-
els to estimate differences in mean BMI (kg/m2) between each SEP class and the referent
group (class I). We additionally checked if results differed when using regression models with
log-transformed BMI to estimate relative differences (i.e., percentage) in BMI. To limit the
potential for reverse causality, analyses using adult SEP were limited to contemporaneous and
future BMI (�42 y). Given expected gender differences in association (with larger inequalities
in women),[7, 8] all analyses were conducted separately in each gender, and gender differences
were formally tested by including an interaction term (gender�SEP). Deviation from linearity

 in the association between SEP and BMI was examined using Wald tests to determine whether
coefficients for SEP (modelled as a categorical term) were equal to zero, in a model which also
contained SEP modelled as a continuous term. To examine if the size of inequalities in BMI
differed by cohort, regression models were also fitted on BMI at 42/43 y for all three cohorts
combined, where differences in age of BMI measurements were smallest so that inequalities
could be compared with respect to both childhood and adult SEP. A dummy term for each
cohort was included in the model, and SEP�cohort interaction was tested. In all cohort-com-
bined models, weights to account for the stratified nature of the 1946 NSHD cohort were
applied, and all participants from 1958 NCDS and 1970 BCS were given the same weighting
value of one. All analyses were conducted using statistical software STATA 14 (StataCorp,
2009).
SEP differences in risk of overweight or obesity.
The primary analyses described above
used BMI as a continuous outcome, since preservation of the continuous nature of the out-
come preserves statistical power and may enable a greater understanding of the nature of adi-
posity inequalities than analyses using binary outcomes. However, to aid public health
interpretation, all analyses were repeated using a binary outcome indicating normal
(BMI < 25) or overweight/obese (BMI � 25) as an outcome. Overweight and obese were
grouped together given the low obesity prevalence at younger ages, and participants classified
as thin were excluded from analyses (2% of observations).[6] Inequalities were estimated using
linear probability models to derive differences in prevalence by SEP group, and using log-bino-
mial generalized linear models to estimate the relative risks of overweight/obesity in each SEP
group.
Do SEP differences in BMI differ by age?.
Trajectories of BMI were modelled using mul-
tilevel models—BMI measurements (level 1) were nested within individuals (level 2). We
adopted a quadratic function for age to summarize the longitudinal changes of BMI. We speci-
fied a random intercept and random slope (linear term for age). SEP (as a categorical variable)
was added to the models to examine its associations with BMI across adulthood. Differences in
rate of BMI change between SEP groups were examined by including age�SEP interaction
terms (age2�SEP interactions were not found and therefore not included in models; p > 0.05).
Finally, a cohort combining all three cohorts was fitted, and an age�SEP�cohort interaction
term was included to test whether the change in association by age differed by cohort. This
model also contained cohort main effects, and all two-way interactions (age�SEP, age�cohort,
SEP�cohort). Only fixed effects models were fitted when analysing adult SEP in 1970 BCS,
since only one age point of BMI was available. Finally, additional models were conducted to
examine whether associations between childhood SEP and BMI were explained by adult SEP.
In these models, participants with valid data for SEP and valid BMI data on at least one age
were included in analyses.
Additional and sensitivity analyses.
To examine the extent to which self-reported BMI
data could bias SEP and BMI associations, we calculated differences in BMI in the 1958 NCDS
at 42 y (self-reported) and 44 y (objectively measured)—the closest proximity of BMI self-
reporting and objective measures in our data. We then examined relations between SEP and
this difference measure: larger scores would indicate misreporting and/or excessive weight
change. We were unable to adjust for an indicator of self-reporting or objective BMI measure-
ment method in our models due to collinearity between measurement method and age/cohort.
Finally, to inform the extent to which differences in missing data between cohorts could affect
results, we compared the extent of missing SEP and BMI data by cohort and examined the
characteristics of those with missing data.

 Results
BMI was typically higher at older ages within each cohort and in cohorts born more recently.
BMI was also generally higher amongst those of lower rather than higher SEP (S1 and S2
Tables). Obesity or overweight prevalence followed the same patterns (S3 and S4 Tables).
Childhood SEP
In each cohort, lower childhood SEP was associated with higher mean BMI at all ages
(Table 1). Associations tended to be stronger among women than men: evidence for gender
interaction with childhood SEP (P<0.05) was found in the 1946 NSHD (at 60–64 y), the 1958
NCDS (33, 42, 44, and 50 y), and the 1970 BCS (30 and 42 y). Associations were also found to
be nonlinear in many cases, with kg/m2 differences in BMI between classes I and IV (partly
skilled) being larger than those between I and V (unskilled).
The sizes of SEP differences in BMI were of considerable magnitude. For example, compar-
ing mean BMI at 42/43 y amongst women in the lowest compared with highest childhood
SEP, there was a 1.7 kg/m2 (95% CI: 0.2, 3.2) difference in the 1946 NSHD, 1.5 kg/m2 (0.6, 2.5)
difference in the 1958 NCDS, and 2.7 kg/m2 (1.6, 3.9) difference in the 1970 BCS. However,
there was little evidence that the size of BMI inequalities differed systematically by cohort (p-
value for cohort�childhood SEP term = 0.33 in men and 0.20 in women; findings were similar
when analyzing BMI differences in relative instead of absolute scales). Analyses using over-
weight or obese as a binary outcome yielded similar results (S5 Table). For example, compar-
ing the difference in prevalence at 42/43 y amongst women in the lowest compared with
highest childhood SEP, there was a 22.5% (5.9%, 39.2%) difference in the 1946 NSHD, 14.2%
(5.1%, 23.3%) in the 1958 NCDS, and 15.7% (5.4%, 25.9%) in the 1970 BCS.
Inequalities in BMI within each cohort were typically larger at older ages, as indicated by
positive age�SEP interaction terms for the lower SEP groups (Figs 1 and 2, multilevel model
estimates shown in S6 Table). For example, among women in the 1946 NSHD, the estimated
BMI difference between class I and V of 1.45 kg/m2 (0.61, 2.29) at 26 years had increased to
3.30 kg/m2 (1.38, 5.21) at 60–64 y. The size of these age-related increases in inequality did not
appear to differ systematically by cohort except in men, where age-related increases appeared
to be stronger in the 1958 NCDS and 1970 BCS than the 1946 NSHD (p = 0.001
age�SEP�cohort interaction; p = 0.01 in women). These associations occurred alongside both
age-related increases in mean BMI and secular increases in mean BMI in later born cohorts—
mean BMI in the highest SEP group in the BCS 1970 was comparable to that of the lowest SEP
group in the 1946 NSHD. Finally, associations between childhood SEP and BMI were typically
only partly attenuated after adjustment for adult SEP (S7 Table).
Adult SEP
Lower adult SEP was typically associated with higher BMI (Table 2). As with childhood SEP
differences, these associations were typically stronger among women than men—evidence for
gender interaction with adult SEP (p < 0.05) was found in the 1946 NSHD (at 43, 53, and 60–
64 y), the 1958 NCDS (42 and 44 y), and the 1970 BCS (42 y)—and for nonlinearity in the
shape of associations.
Among women, the size of BMI inequalities was progressively larger in each subsequent
cohort. For example, the mean differences in BMI at 42/43 y amongst women in the lowest
compared with highest social class was 2.0 kg/m2 (95% CI: −0.1, 4.0) in the 1946 NSHD, 2.3
(1.1, 3.4) in the 1958 NCDS, and 3.9 (2.3, 5.4) in the 1970 BCS—p(for cohort�SEP term) =
0.01. These cohort differences were driven by slight decreases in mean BMI in the highest
social class and increases in BMI amongst those in the lowest social classes (S2 Table). There

 was no such evidence of cohort differences in men (p = 0.7), and findings for either gender did
not differ when using relative instead of absolute measures of inequality. For example, among
women, percentage differences in BMI at 42/43 in the lowest compared with highest social
class were 6.4% (−1.3, 14.1) in the 1946 NSHD, 8.1% (4.0, 12.3) in the 1958 NCDS, and 14.0%
(8.5, 19.6) in 1970 BCS. Mean (standard deviation [SD]) BMI in the highest and lowest social
classes were as follows: 24.9 (0.8) versus 26.8 (0.7) in the 1946 NSHD, 24.2 (0.4) versus 26.5
(0.4) in the 1958 NCDS, and 24.2 (0.3) versus 28.1 (0.8) in the 1970 BCS (see S2 Table). Analy-
ses using overweight or obese as binary outcomes yielded similar results (S8 Table). For exam-
ple, when comparing the percentage difference in prevalence at 42/43 y amongst women in the
lowest compared with highest adult SEP, there was a 5.2% (−26.2, 36.5) difference in the 1946
NSHD, 20.2% (8.6, 31.9) in the 1958 NCDS, and 26.9% (12.5, 41.2) in the 1970 BCS.
Among men in the 1958 NCDS, adult SEP and BMI associations tended to become larger at
older ages—the estimated difference in BMI between class IV and I was 0.98 kg/m2 (0.43, 1.54)
at 43 y and 1.57 kg/m2 (0.91, 2.23) at 50 y (Fig 3 and Fig 4 and S9 Table). These differences
were not found among men in the 1946 NSHD (p < 0.001 age�SEP�cohort interaction).
Among women, there was no evidence that associations systematically changed with age in
either cohort (p = 0.97 age�SEP�cohort interaction).
Additional and sensitivity analyses
We did not find evidence that differences in BMI at 42 (self-reported) and 44 y (objectively
measured) differed according to childhood (p = 0.9 in men, p = 0.2 in women) or adult SEP
(p = 0.3 in men, p = 0.3 in women) in the 1958 NCDS (S10 Table). More recently born cohorts
had greater missing SEP and BMI data; similarly in each cohort, those with lower childhood

 SEP or higher preceding BMI were more likely to have missing adult SEP and BMI data (S1
Text).
Discussion
Main findings
Using longitudinal data from three British birth cohorts who experienced the obesity epidemic
at increasingly younger ages in adulthood, we identified large and persisting socioeconomic
inequalities in BMI from age 20 up to ages 60–64. Inequalities according to childhood SEP
were evident in both men and women, were typically larger at older ages, and were similar in
magnitude at any given age in all three cohorts. Inequalities according to adult SEP were more
evident in women than men, yet did not consistently differ by age. Among women, inequalities
were found to be larger in both absolute and relative terms in the 1970 BCS compared with
earlier-born cohorts in midlife BMI (i.e., BMI at age 42/43 y when measured in 2012 compared
with 2000 or 1989), while in men they remained constant.
Comparison with previous studies
Our findings are broadly consistent with evidence of persisting inequalities in obesity or BMI
derived from separate studies utilizing repeated cross-sectional data and adult SEP indicators.
For example, in English adults aged 18–64, BMI inequalities according to adult manual or
nonmanual social class did not change (in absolute terms) from 1993/4 to 2002/3,[13] yet obe-
sity inequalities increased in absolute but not relative terms according to area-based socioeco-
nomic circumstances among older (age �55) but not younger (16–54) adults from 1994 to

 2008.[14] In Scotland, obesity inequalities (in relative terms) according to education or income
in adults were estimated to have decreased from 1995 to 2011 (age 16–65).[15] Studies using
birth cohort data have also reported inequalities in BMI yet are either limited to investigation
of single birth cohorts,[22–25, 27] or use multiple birth cohorts in a more limited manner
(e.g., among regional samples with limited overlap between ages/y born,[47] or among two
national birth cohorts using BMI at one age and a binary SEP indicator[26]). Our findings add
to the international evidence base, also derived from repeated cross-sectional data, suggesting
persisting inequalities in high income countries and/or emerging inequalities in low–middle
income countries.[17–21]
Our study adds to previous knowledge by providing a more detailed understanding of how
inequalities in BMI have changed across a longer timeframe. Despite large societal changes in
occupations and a reduction in absolute disadvantage in the later 20th century, we found that
social class inequalities have persisted across three generations. Two additional findings also
suggest a greater potential cause for concern than previously thought: for childhood SEP, asso-
ciations typically widened with increasing age in all three cohorts and, for adult SEP, associa-
tions appear to have become larger in more recently born generations of women.
Explanation of findings
Inequalities in BMI are likely to be explained by inequalities in the determinants of weight
gain both before and during adulthood. In support of this, systematic reviews and large popu-
lation-based studies have found evidence for inequalities in both indicators of physical activity
[48, 49] and diet.[50–52] The persistence of inequalities in BMI across cohorts suggests that
inequalities in the determinants of BMI have not substantially changed,[53] despite policies
designed to reduce them.[54, 55] The net influence of childhood SEP on the determinants of
BMI, operating both in childhood and adulthood, may therefore have not differed in each
cohort. If this were the case, our finding of increasing size of inequalities in BMI found at older
compared with younger ages (according to childhood SEP) may be due to the accumulation of
periods of weight gain which would be expected to track across life.[56] Part of the childhood
SEP and BMI associations are also likely to be explained by continuity of SEP into adulthood,
although we found limited evidence for a prominent mediating role of adult social class (as in
other studies[22–26]). However, such pathways may be more appropriately identified in analy-
ses that account for potential intermediary confounding[57] and the multidimensional and
time-varying nature of adult SEP.
Although we are not aware of studies that have examined trends in diet and physical activity
inequalities in these birth cohorts, there are some co-occurring cultural and economic changes
which may have been expected to have increased BMI inequalities across time. For example,
the relative cost of a high-quality diet increased in the UK (and other high income countries)
from the 1990s–2010,[58] although it is unclear if this was matched by increased inequalities
in dietary intake.[14, 59] In addition, studies have suggested that there have been increasing
cultural expectations from the 1970s onwards for women to be thin,[60] yet for men to be
muscular.[61, 62] Since women of higher SEP are likely to have had greater resources to follow
these trends, these changes could explain the increasing inequalities observed in the 1970 BCS
compared with earlier born cohorts; mean BMI in the most advantaged group remained simi-
lar in all three cohorts. Women also experience additional putative risk factors for weight gain
which men do not, such as childbirth and the menopausal transition,[63] yet these factors have
not explained BMI inequalities in previous studies.[64] Inequalities in leisure time physical
activity widened among older women but not men in England from 1994–2008 (according to
an area-based socioeconomic indicator)[14], and occupational-related physical activity may

 have declined, especially amongst manual social classes, due to declines in the number of phys-
ical occupations.[65] However, it should be noted that understanding the relative contribution
of diet and physical activity to BMI inequalities, and how these may change across time, is
likely to be challenging due to the difficulties in accurately assessing these behaviours in the
population.
In addition, labour market participation has changed across time, with increasing participa-
tion from women in the 1970 BCS compared with the 1946 NSHD.[66] Such differences could
potentially affect estimates of how inequalities in BMI have changed across time, particularly
among women. A conservative interpretation of our results would therefore limit them to pro-
viding evidence of how socioeconomic inequality in BMI has changed amongst those whose
fathers were employed as children, or those subsequently employed as adults. Despite overall
declining population smoking rates, relative inequalities in smoking have increased,[67] a pat-
tern which could affect BMI inequality, since smoking has a modest association with lower
weight. However, smoking has been found not to explain associations between SEP and BMI
in other cohorts,[68] and smoking was not associated with obesity in the 1946 NSHD,[69] nor
in the 1970 BCS.[70] Finally, mortality rates are likely to have been highest in lower SEP
groups[71] and those with higher BMI,[72] which might partly explain the lower-than-
expected BMI found in the lowest SEP group among men at older ages.
Strengths and limitations
Strengths of this study include the use of three national birth cohort studies initiated in 1946,
1958, and 1970, with harmonized data for SEP and BMI across life. These data are especially
well-suited to examine the emergence of inequalities in BMI across age and generation. Limita-
tions include the use of BMI which, although strongly positively correlated with fat mass[73],
does not distinguish fat and lean (muscle) mass. Lower SEP has been associated with lower lean
mass in the 1946 NSHD (after adjustment)[23], so the use of BMI could have resulted in under-
estimating socioeconomic inequalities in fat mass, compared with direct measures of fat mass.
Indeed, given evidence that BMI and blood pressure associations are stronger in the 1958
NCDS than the 1946 NSHD,[74] it may be amongst later born cohorts a given BMI value
reflects increasingly more fat than lean mass compared with earlier born cohorts.
All included studies experienced attrition that, as expected,[43, 44] was generally more pro-
nounced amongst those of lower SEP and/or with higher BMI. The use of multilevel models
enabled those with incomplete information to be included in our analyses (under the assump-
tion of missing at random). However, as in all observational studies, we cannot rule out the
possibility that missing data are nonignorable and therefore might bias our findings. Missing
SEP and BMI data were also more frequent in later born cohorts, which might bias results
regarding cross cohort changes in BMI inequality. Studies have found that greater attrition or
nonresponse in longitudinal studies typically leads to a reduction in the magnitude of health
inequalities observed;[75] analogous findings were also found in the present study, since child-
hood SEP and BMI associations were generally weaker in the samples which additionally had
valid adult SEP data (S7 Table). This direction of bias may therefore have led to us underesti-
mating increases in BMI inequality observed amongst more recently born cohorts (which
were observed for women), and increases in the size of BMI inequality at older ages (which
were found for both men and women). In support of the representativeness of the included
birth cohorts, obesity estimates have been found to be similar with those from the Health Sur-
vey for England.[6] However, such biases should be considered when interpreting these, and
other, results on how SEP differences may have changed across time—cross-sectional health
surveys have moderate response rates (around 40 to 60%) which have declined in recent

 decades.[76] We used harmonized measures of occupational-based social class, yet these
cohorts predate the 2000 move to NS-SEC social class used in the UK.[77] The use of social
class omitted participants not currently employed; class is also only one dimension of SEP—
others (e.g., education, income, and wealth) may yield health-relevant information indepen-
dent of class, and therefore warrant further study. Finally, we focused on average differences
across social groups, whereas within-group differences may have also changed by cohort, and
this warrants investigation.[78]
Implications
The persistence of inequalities in BMI throughout adulthood across different generations sug-
gests that new and/or improved strategies are required to reduce them. Indeed, the UK gov-
ernment has, through a number of initiatives, aimed to reduce both obesity and its inequality
since 1998, with limited current success.[54, 55] While there is some evidence that interven-
tions targeted at disadvantaged populations can result in reductions in BMI, there is limited
high-quality evidence on population-wide interventions, as well as on the relative timing of
interventions across life.[79] Given our findings of progressively widening BMI inequalities
across adulthood, and the fact that BMI tends to track across life,[56] interventions may be
most effective when initiated as early as possible in adulthood. Interventions which require lit-
tle individual agency[80] may be especially efficacious at lowering population BMI levels and
reducing inequalities. For example, increasing taxation on unhealthy foods while subsidizing
others may be effective, despite potentially being financially regressive in the short term.[81,
82] Coordinated analyses of how inequalities in BMI differ across countries may also help to
identify strategies which successfully reduce BMI inequalities.[83] Ultimately, targeting
inequalities in socioeconomic resources may be more effective than targeting specific mediat-
ing factors, since the relative importance of the mediators may change across time and inter-
ventions may inadvertently increase inequalities.[84] Reducing inequalities in socioeconomic
resources in childhood may be particularly beneficial by affecting both early life determinants
of adult BMI and subsequent adult SEP inequalities. Indeed, such early interventions will also
be best placed to reduce inequalities in childhood obesity, which are found in cohorts born
more recently (e.g., those born in 2000/1);[85] understanding how adiposity inequalities have
changed in different generations in childhood requires investigation of childhood growth in
terms of weight, height, and height-adjusted weight.
Conclusions
Our findings, based on historic longitudinal data, demonstrate that the overweight and obesity
epidemic has disproportionately impacted adults in Britain born in 1946, 1958, and 1970 who
were more socioeconomically disadvantaged in childhood or adulthood. They prompt consid-
eration of how inequalities can be reduced amongst these and future cohorts, given the consid-
erable expected adverse health impacts.
