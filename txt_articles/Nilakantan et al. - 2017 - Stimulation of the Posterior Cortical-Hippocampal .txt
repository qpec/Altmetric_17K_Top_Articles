Summary
Episodic memory is thought to critically depend on interaction of the hippocampus with 
distributed brain regions [1–3]. Specific contributions of distinct networks have been 
hypothesized, with the hippocampal posterior-medial (HPM) network implicated in recollection of 
highly precise contextual and spatial information [3–6]. Current evidence for HPM specialization 
is mostly indirect, derived from correlative measures such as neural activity recordings. Here, we 
tested the causal role of HPM in recollection using network-targeted noninvasive brain stimulation 
in humans, which has previously been shown to increase functional connectivity within the HPM 
network [7]. Effects of multiple-day electromagnetic stimulation were assessed using an object-
location memory task that segregated recollection precision from general recollection success. 
HPM network-targeted stimulation produced lasting (~24 h) enhancement of recollection 
precision, without effects on general success. Canonical neural correlates of recollection [8–10] 
were also modulated by stimulation. Late-positive evoked potential amplitude and theta-alpha 
oscillatory power were reduced, suggesting that stimulation can improve memory through 
enhanced reactivation of detailed visuospatial information at retrieval. The HPM network was thus 
specifically implicated in processing of fine-grained memory detail, supporting functional 
specialization of hippocampal-cortical networks. These findings demonstrate that brain networks 
can be causally linked to distinct and specific neurocognitive functions and suggest mechanisms 
for long-lasting changes in memory due to network-targeted stimulation.

Results
Even when recollection of past episodes is successful, the amount of retrieved information 
can vary [11], providing memory for precise details in some cases (e.g., “The store was on 
the left, four blocks ahead of the first stop light.”) and more general memory in others (e.g., 
“The store was on the left side of the street.”). Several lines of evidence suggest preferential 
contributions to high-precision memory by the posterior hippocampus [6], including smaller 
receptive fields for posterior compared to anterior hippocampus ([12]; dorsal versus ventral 
in the rodent). Indeed, distinct functional large-scale networks of posterior versus anterior 
hippocampus and surrounding parahippocampal regions [13] have been hypothesized to 
differentially support precise versus general/gist-based memory, respectively [3–6]. 
However, there is little direct evidence for the reliance of recollection precision on 
distributed functional brain networks. To test the hypothesized involvement of the HPM 
network in memory precision, we used noninvasive electromagnetic stimulation methods 
that increase functional connectivity of the HPM network [7] in conjunction with a graded 
assessment of associative object-location memory (Figure 1A) designed to segregate 
recollection precision from general success [11]. We predicted that HPM network-targeted 
stimulation would improve memory precision and modulate established EEG correlates of 
recollection [8].
There is high anatomical [14] and fMRI connectivity [13, 15] between lateral-parietal cortex 
and hippocampus. We have previously shown that five daily sessions of repetitive high-
frequency transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) delivered to stimulation-accessible 
parietal-cortex locations enhances fMRI connectivity between posterior hippocampus and 
the associated retrosplenial, parahippocampal, medial-parietal, and lateral-parietal HPM 
cortical network regions [7]. We identified participant-specific stimulation locations in the 
lateral-parietal cortex based on high resting-state fMRI connectivity with anatomically 
defined left-hippocampal seed locations (Figure 1B, Figure S1), in order to noninvasively 
target the HPM network.
Sixteen participants completed a two-week, sham-controlled, counterbalanced paradigm 
(Figure 1C), involving memory testing ~24 hours before and after HPM network-targeted 
stimulation (Stim) compared to rTMS of the same intensity delivered to the vertex, a 
location outside of the HPM network (Sham) (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures 
for further details). At each of the assessments (Pre-Stim, Post-Stim, Pre-Sham and Post-
Sham), EEG was collected during memory recall of 96 unique object locations (Figure 1A). 
Pre-Stim and Pre-Sham data were collapsed into a common Baseline. Main analyses include 
data from only the participants that contributed to EEG comparisons (n=12), although the 
same pattern of selective effects on recall precision was found in the entire sample (see 
below and Supplemental Experimental Procedures for more details).

 Network-Targeted Stimulation Selectively Improved Recollection Precision
Trials were scored for distance error (difference between recalled and studied locations) and 
sorted into successful recollection (67.6% of trials, SE=4.5%) and guess conditions using a 
two-parameter model that segregates recollection precision from general recollection success 
[11] (Figure 1D, see Supplemental Experimental Procedures). We did not hypothesize 
effects of stimulation on general recollection success, which was tested using two 
complementary approaches. First, the proportion of trials categorized as reflecting successful 
recollection (distance errors less than the 4.88-cm threshold, see Supplementary Methods) 
did not significantly change Post-Stim (t(11)=1.88, p=0.26) or Post-Sham (t(11)=0.18, 
p=0.86) relative to Baseline. Second, the same growth-mixture fitting was used to define the 
group-level threshold for recollection success was used to estimate successful recollection 
for each participant and memory assessment ([11]; see Supplementary Methods). 
Individualized successful recollection thresholds did not significantly differ for Pre-Stim 
versus Post-Stim (t(11)=0.603, p=0.56) nor for Pre-Sham versus Post-Sham (t(11)=0.591, 
p=0.57). Both methods thus converged to indicate that stimulation did not alter general 
recollection success.
Precision was defined as the mean distance error for successful recollection trials [11]. In 
contrast to general success, recollection precision measured Post-Stim improved relative to 
Baseline (t(11)=2.99, p=0.01; Cohen’s d=0.86), but not for Post-Sham relative to Baseline 
(t(11)=0.14, p=0.89) (Figure 1E). The percent-improvement from Baseline was significantly 
greater for Post-Stim than Post-Sham (t(11)=2.63, p=0.02; Cohen’s d=0.76). Furthermore, 
raw distance error (Figure 1F) was less for Post-Stim than for Post-Sham (t(11)=2.68, 
p=0.02, Cohen’s d=0.77). Thus, HPM network-targeted stimulation (and not Sham) 
improved recollection precision. Recollection precision improvements were highly 
consistent across subjects due to Stim (12/12 improved; Figure 1G; Sign Test p<0.0005) but 
were at chance due to Sham (6/12 improved; Figure 1H; Sign Test p=1.0). Similar effects of 
stimulation were identified when individual Pre-Stim and Pre-Sham values were used rather 
than the common Baseline (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures), confirming that 
stimulation improved precision irrespective of the choice of baseline. Precision 
improvements were also highly consistent in the entire N=16 sample. Percent-improvement 
values (Post versus Pre) were significantly greater for Stim than for Sham (t(15)=2.89, 
p=0.01; Cohen’s d=0.72), and precision improvements due to Stim were highly consistent 
across subjects (15/16 improved; Sign Test p=0.0005) but were at chance due to Sham (7/16 
improved; Sign Test p=0.80) (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures for additional full-
sample analysis details).
To test the possibility that the relative difference for Stim vs. Sham effects was due to 
impairments for Sham rather than improvements for Stim (as rTMS intensity for Stim and 
Sham was matched but with delivery to different locations), we also performed a separate 
control experiment in which zero-intensity stimulation was delivered to the HPM parietal 
target in an additional group of subjects (N=12; see Supplementary Methods). Precision 
memory was not reliably improved in this additional control condition. There was no 
significant change in raw error Post-Control versus Pre-Control (t(11)=1.57, p=0.145). 
Furthermore, improvements were not consistent across subjects (7/12 participants improved;

 Sign Test p=0.774; see Supplementary Results for more details). Precision improvements 
were therefore selective for Stim, and did not occur for either of the control conditions.
Network-Targeted Stimulation Reduced Evoked EEG Correlates of Recollection
Theta-alpha frequency oscillatory activity and late-positive event-related potentials (ERP) 
are stimulus-evoked neural correlates of recollection [9, 10]. We hypothesized that 
stimulation would modulate these neural signals of memory retrieval [16], providing neural 
correlates of the corresponding recollection precision improvement [17]. Many 
manipulations that increase the subjective experience of recollection and memory response 
accuracy correspond to increases in low-frequency oscillatory power and event-related late-
positive ERP amplitude. However, reductions in oscillations and event-related potentials 
have also been associated with memory retrieval, specifically for sensory reactivation [18, 
19] and increased flexibility for high-resolution information storage [20]. The nature of 
effects on EEG/ERP correlates of memory retrieval (i.e., enhancements or reductions) 
therefore can provide mechanistic insights regarding precision improvement due to Stim.
Based on fMRI-EEG evidence linking 4–13-Hz (theta-alpha) oscillatory EEG activity to 
fMRI connectivity of the retrosplenial cortex and hippocampus during recollection [8], we 
first tested the effect of stimulation on evoked oscillatory EEG power using this a priori 
frequency band of interest. We compared 4–13-Hz evoked oscillations for successfully 
recollected trials among Post-Stim, Post-Sham, and Baseline conditions. Cluster-based non-
parametric simulation testing yielded significant frontoparietally distributed (Figure S2A) 
power reduction from 524–765ms for Post-Stim relative to Baseline (Figure 2ABC; cluster-
corrected p=0.03). The same test for Post-Sham relative to Baseline identified no significant 
power differences (p>0.3). 4–13-Hz power averaged for all electrodes for the 524–765-ms 
period (Figure 2D) was significantly less Post-Stim compared to Baseline (t(11)=3.00, 
p=0.01, Cohen’s d=0.87) and compared to Post-Sham (t(11)=2.24, p=0.05, Cohen’s d=0.65), 
whereas the Post-Sham versus Baseline difference was not significant (t(11)=0.14, p=0.88). 
These reductions of theta-alpha power were consistent across subjects due to Stim 
(reductions in 10/12 participants; Sign Test p=0.039; Figure 2E), but not due to Sham 
(reductions in 7/12 participants; Sign Test p=0.774; Figure 2F). Further, an independent 
cluster-based non-parametric test for frequency across an a priori recollection latency 
interval [10], identified significant 6–11.5 Hz power reduction for Post-Stim versus Baseline 
(Figure S2B) and no significant differences for Post-Sham versus Baseline, consistent with 
the a priori frequency band used for primary analyses. Inter-trial theta-alpha phase 
coherence was reduced Post-Stim relative to Baseline and Post-Sham late in the epoch 
(Figure S2C), suggesting that sustained stimulus-evoked processing was reduced Post-Stim. 
Thus, stimulation-induced recollection precision improvement was associated with 
corresponding reductions in theta-alpha oscillatory activity.
We next tested the effect of stimulation on event-related potential (ERP) correlates of 
successful recollection. Comparison of recollection success ERPs for both Post-Sham and 
Post-Stim yielded prototypical late-onset positive increases in amplitudes for successful 
recollected trials relative to guesses at parietal and occipital electrodes (known as the 
“parietal memory effect” [10]; Figure S3). This indicates reliable ERP correlates of

 successful memory irrespective of stimulation condition. For the 524–765ms latency interval 
of interest derived from cluster-based permutation testing, mean ERP amplitude for parietal-
occipital electrodes was reduced Post-Stim relative to Baseline (t(11)=3.31, p<0.01; Cohen’s 
d=0.96) whereas Post-Sham amplitudes did not differ from Baseline (t(11)=0.86, p=0.41) 
(Figure 3AB). Further, correlation analyses using robust fitting to guard against outlier 
influences indicated that greater Post-Stim versus Baseline amplitude reduction was 
associated with greater recollection precision improvement (Robust-r=0.659, p=0.02) 
(Figure 3C). This relationship was not significant for Post-Sham (Robust-r=0.023, p=0.94). 
Stimulation thus reduced amplitudes of ERP correlates of recollection and these reductions 
corresponded to recollection precision improvements. As was the case for effects on 
recollection precision, theta-alpha power and mean ERP amplitudes were not significantly 
changed due to zero-intensity control stimulation in the additional control group (see 
Supplemental Experimental Procedures).
Discussion
Stimulation targeted to the HPM network improved precision, but not general success, of 
associative object-location memory. Notably, lesion-deficit and fMRI studies have 
implicated the human hippocampus [21–24] as well as parietal cortex [25, 26] in memory 
for precise details, suggesting that stimulation affected these HPM network locations. 
Indeed, changes in fMRI connectivity caused by the same stimulation parameters used here 
enhanced fMRI connectivity within the HPM network, particularly for hippocampus and 
medial aspects of parietal, occipital, and retrosplenial cortex [7]. Interestingly, just as fMRI 
connectivity enhancements with hippocampus were greater for medial regions than the 
lateral parietal regions that were stimulated [7], the changes in EEG/ERP correlates of 
recollection reported here occurred with medial distributions that were distal to the 
stimulation location (Figure 2, Figure 3). Collectively, this supports the interpretation that 
there were network-level effects of stimulation reflecting HPM-network involvement in 
memory precision.
In a previous study, HPM-network targeted stimulation improved paired-associate cued 
recall, also measured ~24 hours after the final stimulation session [7]. Cued recall is an “all-
or-nothing” memory measure, and so differentiation of recollection precision from success 
was not possible. Relative to the previous cued recall testing, the current memory test 
involved substantially larger memory demands using a very different format (~100 random 
objects at precise locations within a redundant grid display versus ~20 face-word pairings in 
the previous study). Nonetheless, it is noteworthy that the effect sizes for stimulation on 
precision reported here (in a range typically classified as large) are similar to those obtained 
previously for cued recall [7]. The current findings provide novel information on the 
network basis of memory because they demonstrate the link between a highly specific aspect 
of memory, recollection precision, and the HPM network. Isolation of stimulation effects on 
precision from other co-occurring memory processes such as memory success within the 
same task is especially crucial for validating stimulation effects on memory and network-
level processing, as condition-selective effects help mitigate influences from potential 
nonspecific factors such as history, practice, and placebo effects.

 Stimulation targeted to the HPM network reduced amplitude of EEG correlates of 
recollection precision. This reduction is consistent with the hypothesis that successful 
retrieval of visual details corresponds to rapid memory reactivation [19, 27] and aligns with 
mounting evidence that reduced theta power correlates with better item-context memory 
[20]. One possibility is that stimulation promotes asynchronous activity within the medial 
temporal lobe and the neo-cortex, which produces the flexibility for higher resolution 
information storage and retrieval [27–31]. Increased EEG/ERP power and amplitude has 
been related to improved memory in many studies [9, 10, 17], and EEG/ERP oscillatory 
enhancements versus reductions may represent a neural distinction between general/
semantic memory success and visuospatial memory precision. Memory for general 
information can benefit from verbal-semantic mnemonic strategies associated with the 
anterior hippocampal network, with heightened verbalization of recollection content during 
retrieval related to EEG/ERP increases. In contrast, the HPM network may support memory 
for precise perceptual details [3, 5] that does not benefit substantially from semantic 
strategies. This latter type of memory might be indicated by EEG/ERP decreases, as we 
observed due to stimulation in conjunction with enhanced memory for these perceptual 
details.
Evoked activity reductions may also indicate efficient processing. For example, evoked 
activity reductions can occur in conjunction with enhanced fMRI connectivity in 
experiments on priming [32], which is though to reflect heightened processing efficiency 
[33]. This pattern is consistent with our findings, in which stimulation enhanced HPM 
network fMRI connectivity [7] and reduced recollection-related evoked activity, specifically 
at frequencies characteristic of HPM network communication [34]. Although effects on 
memory precision were robust in the entire sample, our EEG/ERP subsample was relatively 
small. Nonetheless, several design features enhance confidence in reported neural findings, 
including strong a priori hypotheses on the particular neural signals that would be affected 
by stimulation, effects that significantly outlasted the stimulation sessions, as well as 
matched-intensity control (Sham) stimulation in addition to a separate zero-intensity, site-
specific control group.
To summarize, our findings causally support hypothesized functional specialization of large-
scale hippocampal-cortical networks. Although stronger tests of network functional 
subdivision could utilize control stimulation sites at varying levels of distance from the 
targeted network, our findings of stimulation-induced changes for a specific aspect of 
memory, recollection precision, extends previous lesion-based causal evidence for large-
scale brain network involvement in cognition. That is, lesion-based accounts have 
necessarily focused on broad cognitive constructs, providing evidence for large-scale 
networks involved in language, attention, memory, and visuospatial processing [35], whereas 
the current findings demonstrate a causal role for a stimulation-responsive brain network and 
a highly specific neurocognitive construct. Finally, mechanisms by which brain stimulation 
affects cognition remain mysterious. There have been few demonstrations of stimulation 
effects on highly specific neural markers of well-defined cognitive processes [36], but in 
those studies effects did not outlast the period when stimulation was applied. The 
recollection precision improvements reported here outlasted the period of stimulation by ~24 
h, consistent with our previous report of improvements lasting up to ~2 weeks after

 stimulation [37]. These long-lasting stimulation-induced changes included neural markers of 
detailed memory-content reactivation during recollection, thereby advancing understanding 
of how noninvasive brain stimulation could alter network function. Generation of long-
lasting improvement in memory ability (rather than improved retention of specific material) 
has implications for the development of treatments for the many disorders related to 
hippocampal-cortical network dysfunction [15].

 Figure 1. HPM network-targeted stimulation enhanced recollection precision
A. Participants studied trial-unique objects at randomly assigned locations. Subsequent 
memory testing involved object-cued recall of locations. B. fMRI connectivity used 
anatomically defined hippocampal body seeds (red) to define parietal-maximum stimulation 
locations (blue, circled) in each participant. Each dot indicates locations for one participant 
(see Figure S1). C. Five daily sessions of Stim or Sham stimulation followed Baseline 
memory testing. Post-Stim and Post-Sham testing followed the final daily stimulation 
session by ~24 hours. Stim and Sham conditions were administered within-subjects in

 counterbalanced order. D. Histogram of distance error for all participants and conditions. 
Successful recollection (green) and guessing (gray) trials were defined via converging 
modeling approaches (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures). E. Percent-improvement 
from Baseline was significantly above zero for Post-Stim but not Post-Sham and 
significantly greater for Post-Stim than Post-Sham. F. Distance error for successful 
recollection was reduced Post-Stim relative to Baseline (but not Post-Sham relative to 
Baseline) and Post-Stim relative to Post-Sham (see Table S1). G. Percent change in precision 
due to Stim for each participant. H. Percent change in precision due to Sham for each 
participant *p<0.05

 Figure 2. Stimulation reduced evoked oscillatory correlates of successful recollection
Plot indicates t values for pairwise comparisons of the time × frequency power spectra for A, 
Post-Stim and B, Post-Sham versus Baseline, averaged across electrodes and latency 
identified via cluster detection. The significant cluster of reduced power relative to Baseline 
is evident for Post-Stim but not Post-Sham. C. Topographical maps of t values demonstrate 
the frontal-central distribution of these effects. Electrodes identified via cluster detection are 
highlighted by bold markers. Triangles indicate approximate averaged stimulation locations 
for each condition. See also Figure S2. D. Mean 4–13-Hz averaged power for all electrodes 
was reduced for Post-Stim relative to both Baseline and Post-Sham. For each participant, 
mean 4–13-Hz power percent change is shown E, Post-Stim and F, Post-Sham, relative to 
baseline values. *p<0.05

 Figure 3. Stimulation reduced ERP correlates of successful recollection
A. ERPs for Post-Stim (blue), Post-Sham (dashed-orange) and Baseline (thick gray) for one 
representative electrode (Pz). See also Figure S3. B. Topographical plot of the amplitude 
reduction relative to baseline show the posterior distribution characteristic of the parietal 
memory effect (the circled electrode is Pz). Triangles indicate approximate averaged 
stimulation locations for each condition. C. Relative to Baseline, greater reduction in ERP 
amplitude (Baseline – Post) was associated with greater percent-improvement in recall 
precision for Stim (blue) but not Sham (orange), tested using Robust correlation.
