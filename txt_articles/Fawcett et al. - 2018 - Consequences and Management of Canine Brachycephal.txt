Simple Summary: Canine and human co-evolution have disclosed remarkable morphological
plasticity in dogs. Brachycephalic dog breeds are increasing in popularity, despite them suffering from
well-documented conformation-related health problems. This has implications for the veterinary
caseloads of the future.
Whether the recent selection of dogs with progressively shorter and
wider skulls has reached physiological limits is controversial. The health problems and short life
expectancies of dogs with extremely short skulls suggests that we may have even exceeded these
limits. Veterinarians have a professional and moral obligation to prevent and minimise the negative
health and welfare impacts of extreme morphology and inherited disorders, and they must address
brachycephalic obstructive airway syndrome (BOAS) not only at the level of the patient, but also as a
systemic welfare problem.
Abstract: This article, written by veterinarians whose caseloads include brachycephalic dogs,
argues that there is now widespread evidence documenting a link between extreme brachycephalic
phenotypes and chronic disease, which compromises canine welfare. This paper is divided into nine
sections exploring the breadth of the impact of brachycephaly on the incidence of disease, as indicated
by pet insurance claims data from an Australian pet insurance provider, the stabilization of respiratory
distress associated with brachycephalic obstructive airway syndrome (BOAS), challenges associated
with sedation and the anaesthesia of patients with BOAS; effects of brachycephaly on the brain
and associated neurological conditions, dermatological conditions associated with brachycephalic
breeds, and other conditions, including ophthalmic and orthopedic conditions, and behavioural
consequences of brachycephaly. In the light of this information, we discuss the ethical challenges that
are associated with brachycephalic breeds, and the role of the veterinarian. In summary, dogs with
BOAS do not enjoy freedom from discomfort, nor freedom from pain, injury, and disease, and they do
not enjoy the freedom to express normal behaviour. According to both deontological and utilitarian
ethical frameworks, the breeding of dogs with BOAS cannot be justified, and further, cannot be
recommended, and indeed, should be discouraged by veterinarians.

1. Introduction
Brachycephaly—the foreshortening or flattening of the facial skeleton—is a mutation that is
selected for in some dog breeds, such as the French Bulldog, British Bulldog and Pug [1]. Since the
BBC television program Pedigree Dogs Exposed aired in the UK in 2008, highlighting breed-related
welfare issues, there has been media and scholarly attention on the welfare problems associated
with brachycephalic breeds.
Despite well-documented conformation-related health problems,
brachycephalic dog breeds are increasing in popularity.
Since 2007, the UK Kennel Club has reported a 3104% increase in French Bulldog registrations,
a 193% increase in Pug registrations and a 96% increase in Bulldog registrations [2]. These trends are
echoed in Australia where, since the mid-1980s, consumers have gradually favoured shorter, smaller,
brachycephalic breeds, with the weighted mean cephalic index increasing from 57.7 in 1986 to 62.9
in 2013 [3]. According to figures published by the Australian National Kennel Club (ANKC), there
was an 11.3% increase in French Bulldog registrations (as a proportion of total purebred registrations),
a 320% increase in Pug registrations, and a 324% increase in British Bulldog registrations between 1987
and 2017 [4].
There is now substantial evidence that brachycephaly compromises the welfare of affected
dogs by leading to brachycephalic obstructive airway syndrome (BOAS) [1]. BOAS is a progressive
disorder of the upper airway that is characterized by primary anatomical abnormalities (stenotic nares,
an elongated soft palate, distortion of pharyngeal soft tissues, and a hypoplastic trachea) causing
resistance to airflow and restricted breathing. This leads to increased negative intraluminal pressure
during inspiration, exacerbating soft tissue abnormalities, leading to everted laryngeal saccules,
pharyngeal hyperplasia, tonsillar hyperplasia, and eventual laryngeal collapse [5]. Laryngeal collapse
has been reported in dogs as young as 4.5 months [6].
Clinical signs of BOAS include stertor, stridor, dyspnoea, exercise intolerance, gagging,
regurgitation, cyanosis, hyperthermia and syncope [1]. Extreme brachycephalic breeds (Bulldog,
French Bulldog, and Pug) were 3.5 times more likely to suffer from at least one upper respiratory tract
(URT) disorder than moderate or non-brachycephalic breeds, and were more likely to die due to a URT
disorder [7].
Dogs with BOAS may suffer from concurrent disorders that are unrelated to their upper airway
abnormalities, including ophthalmic conditions, spinal malformation and dystocia [8]. Extreme
brachycephalic dogs had shorter life spans (median longevity 8.6 years) when compared with moderate
and non-brachycephalic dogs (median longevity 12.7 years) [7]. A fundamental consequence of airway
turbulence is the reduced clearance of carbon dioxide, which can lead to acidosis [9]. How this, along
with hypoxia and hypertension, affects enzyme function and oxidative stress is unclear. It is possible
that shifts in homeostasis may have effects on longevity.
In a survey of 15 national kennel clubs, exaggerated morphological features and inherited
disorders and inherited disorders were identified as the most pressing concerns, with kennel
clubs expressing a strong desire to improve the breeding and health of pedigree dogs, including
brachycephalic breeds [10]. In addition to veterinary professional organisations and animal welfare
charities, other organisations are working to address these concerns.
For example, in the UK,
the Advisory Council on the Welfare Issues of Dog Breeding was formed to address inherited
disorders that impact canine quality of life, including extreme brachycephalism and disorders like
syringomyelia [11]. The International Partnership for Dogs, a not-for-profit organization registered
in Sweden, is working with kennel clubs, professional groups and individuals to improve the health,
well-being and welfare of brachycephalic breeds [12]. In addition, kennel clubs are increasingly
investigating fraud in the breeding and registration of brachycephalic breeds. For example, in 2017,
the ANKC established a French Bulldogs taskforce to investigate fraudulent breeding and registration
practices in French Bulldogs, British Bulldogs, Pugs and Staffordshire Bull Terriers [13].
The current article explores the implications of extreme brachycephaly for affected animals, from
the perspectives of veterinarians and veterinary specialists treating these animals. It provides a review

of the known health conditions, welfare impacts and challenges for patient management, to underscore
the enormity of the welfare problems posed by extreme brachycephaly (Sections 2–8). Ultimately,
we argue that veterinarians are ethically obliged to address BOAS, not only at the level of the patient,
but also as a systemic welfare problem.
2. Australian Insurance Data
A recent survey estimated that approximately 609,000 Australian companion animal owners had
a pet insurance policy, representing a 6% overall insurance rate for cats and dogs [14]. Insurance
rates for dogs are higher than for cats. Of the estimated 5.4 million Australians who have a dog, 7.1%
(or approximately 383,400) have pet insurance. This is likely an underestimate. PetSure Australia
(Sydney, Australia) is the largest underwriter of pet insurance in Australia, and at the time of
publication, it underwrites 391,791 canine insurance policies across 28 brands (Petsure Australia
2018, unpublished data).
Petsure Australia has collected relevant prevalent and actuarial data over the years, in the
process of administering its core business of providing pet insurance policies. This includes the
following brachycephalic breeds from their database in its ongoing in-house study: Affenpinscher,
American Bulldog, Australian Bulldog, Australian Bulldog Miniature, Boston Terrier, Boxer, British
Bulldog, Cavalier King Charles Spaniel (CKCS), Dogue De Bordeaux, French Bulldog, Griffon, Griffon
Brabancon, Griffon Bruxellois, Lhasa Apso, Mastiff, Neopolitan Mastiff, Pekingese, Pug and Shih Tzu.
PetSure’s data confirm that there has been a steady rise in the popularity of French Bulldogs over the
past five years (Figure 1).

Pugs have also increased in popularity over the same period, and so the rise in the popularity of
both breeds has contributed significantly to the proportion of brachycephalic breeds insured Table 1.
The ownership rate of the British Bulldog has almost tripled in Australia since 2013. However,
the percentage of insured boxers, a traditionally popular brachycephalic breed, has remained steady
over the same period.

Importantly, data from PetSure demonstrate the health complications that are associated with
severe canine brachycephalism. There was a 69% rise in BOAS as a proportion of all brachycephalic
dog surgery claims between 2013 and 2017. A possible explanation is the increase in the proportion
of French Bulldogs, Pugs and British Bulldogs, breeds that have more exaggerated facial features,
requiring surgical intervention. However, this may also be due to other factors, including an increased
awareness of welfare concerns associated with BOAS among veterinarians, training of general
practitioners in surgical treatment of BOAS, increased capacity to refer to surgical specialists and
an increase of dogs that are covered by insurance.
Many veterinarians combine de-sexing with “other surgeries/procedures”. While it is not unusual
in practice to repair umbilical hernias or to remove deciduous canine teeth at the time of desexing
(traditionally performed at about six months of age), PetSure data from 2013–2016 reveal a difference
in the rate of “other surgery” performed at the time of de-sexing in 11% of brachycephalic dogs,
compared to 7% of non-brachycephalic dogs. The most common procedures performed were hernia
repairs, BOAS surgery and cherry eye repair, in that order.
While much is known about the incidence of airway disease in brachycephalic dogs, many
other conditions are also more likely to occur in these breeds at incident rates that are greater than
in other breeds. Figure 2 shows that prevalence of insurance claims relating to common diseases
in brachycephalic and non-brachycephalic breeds. It is worth noting that not all PetSure policies
cover dental disease, and no polices include coverage for breeding or obstetric procedures, therefore
conditions such as caesarean sections (which are commonly performed in brachycephalic breeds),
do not appear in the Figure 2 below.

conditions such as caesarean sections (which are commonly performed in brachycephalic breeds), do 
not appear in the Figure 2 below. 
 
Figure 2. The prevalence of PetSure insurance claims relating to common diseases in brachycephalic 
and non-brachycephalic breeds from 2013–2017. 
Data collected from PetSure’s database show that whilst brachycephalic breeds have an 
increased incidence of diseases related to their facial conformation, they are also more likely than 
other breeds to be affected by a range of other common diseases. The prevalence of BOAS and the 
incidence of other common diseases is also much higher in pure-bred brachycephalic dogs when 
compared to their crosses. These findings are in line with a previous analysis of analysis of over 1.27 
million pet insurance claims over a nine-year period (2007–2015), excluding conditions specifically 
linked to brachycephaly (stenotic nares, elongated soft palate, tracheal hypoplasia and everted 
laryngeal saccules), found that brachycephalic dogs were more likely to suffer from a range of 
conditions when compared with non-brachycephalic dogs [15]. These included, but were not limited 
to, corneal ulceration, ocular trauma, heat stroke, pneumonia, fungal skin disease and skin cancer. 
Such information is not only valuable for pet insurance companies, but also for the veterinarians 
who treat these conditions, as well as owners of at-risk breeds, who are likely to incur significant 
financial costs over the lifespan of these dogs. 
3. Stabilization of Respiratory Distress 
For dogs, panting is an important component of heat dissipation. Patients with brachycephaly 
have greater respiratory resistance to airflow and a reduced ability to thermoregulate [5]. As such, 
heat stress and upper airway obstruction are intrinsically linked.  
Because of upper airway obstruction, brachycephalic patients must work harder to breathe. 
Upper airway obstruction is common in patients with brachycephaly. The precipitating causes 
include intrinsic end-stage airway collapse and swelling of the airways caused by panting or 
tachypnoea, or following sedation or anaesthetic, when the airway musculature is relaxed. When 
their respiratory drive increases due to hyperthermia, anxiety, pulmonary disease, or other causes, 
excessive negative pressures need to be generated to move larger volumes of air. As a consequence, 
the soft tissues of the upper airway swell, further compromising airflow and heat dissipation. A 
vicious cycle ensues; heat stress can lead to upper airway obstruction, and vice versa. 
3.1. Intubation 
Brachycephalic patients can present with either partial or complete airway obstruction. Patients 
undergoing a partial obstruction will be dyspnoeic, with an audible stertor or stridor, typically with

Upper airway obstruction is common in patients with brachycephaly. The precipitating causes include

upper airway swell, further compromising airflow and heat dissipation. A vicious cycle ensues; heat
stress can lead to upper airway obstruction, and vice versa.
3.1. Intubation
Brachycephalic patients can present with either partial or complete airway obstruction. Patients
undergoing a partial obstruction will be dyspnoeic, with an audible stertor or stridor, typically with
paradoxical motion of the abdomen and orthopnoea. Those with complete obstruction may not
generate any sounds at all as they are unable to move air.
Upon presentation, the clinician must decide on whether to intubate the patient, depending on
the severity of the obstruction. Patients with complete airway obstruction and in respiratory arrest,
 Animals 2019, 9, 3
6 of 25
or for whom the effort of breathing appears unsustainable should be intubated immediately. If there
is time, a quick airway examination should be performed so that the primary cause of obstruction
can be identified before intubation. For all but arrested patients, intubation will require anaesthetic
induction; an intravenous (IV) catheter should be placed as quickly as possible, and a short-acting
induction agent, such as propofol or alfaxan, administered (typically without pre-medication) to effect.
If the patient cannot be intubated, a temporary tracheostomy should be placed.
3.2. Thermoregulation
For patients without complete airway obstruction, conservative management can be first
attempted. However, patients should not be left unsupervised until they are stable, as intubation can
become necessary at any time. Conservative management revolves around three principles: oxygen
supplementation, sedation, and if the patient is hyperthermic, active cooling. It is imperative that these
patients are managed with as little stress as possible, because struggling increases oxygen demand,
and this can precipitate respiratory arrest. Oxygen can be provided via flow-by, mask (although this
can be stressful), oxygen hood, or oxygen cage. Sedation can be administered intramuscularly, and an
IV catheter placed when the patient is more stable. Some patients will tolerate a IV catheter placement
immediately. Butorphanol (0.2–0.3 mg/kg IV ± medetomidine 5 mcg/kg IV) is a reliable protocol.
The goal of sedation is to reduce anxiety and slow the respiratory rate, which will reduce turbulence
and improve airflow. The patient should remain conscious and retain a gag reflex. If the gag reflex is
lost, the patient must be intubated to protect the airways from aspiration, which can lead to pneumonia.
A dose of corticosteroids (dexamethasone 0.15 mg/kg IV or IM) can be administered to help reduce
airway swelling. Corticosteroids should not be given to patients during heat stress, due to potential
gastrointestinal tract (GIT) complications such as GIT ulceration.
All patients should have their rectal temperature taken as soon as is reasonable. Those with
temperature greater than 39.5 ◦C should receive active cooling as follows: administer room temperature
IV fluids, wet the hair-coat with room temperature tap water or wet towels, and place a fan in front
of the patient. The rectal temperature should be checked every 10 mins. Active cooling should be
stopped once the temperature reaches 39.4 ◦C to prevent rebound hypothermia [16].
Patients with heat stress should also be screened for organ injury. The GIT is the most sensitive
to damage, manifesting as vomiting, diarrhoea (often haemorrhagic) and ileus. This can be a major
source of fluid loss. Other potential complications include acute kidney injury, coagulopathy and
hypoglycaemia [17]. Altered mentation is also common, but it is typically quick to resolve.
3.3. Complications
Patients with upper airway obstruction commonly succumb to pulmonary complications such
as aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis and non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema. Once the patient is
stable, it is important to assess pulmonary function. Parameters such as respiratory rate and effort,
thoracic auscultation, pulse oximetry and arterial blood gas analysis can all be used to assess pulmonary
function. If there are any concerns, thoracic radiographs should be performed. The appearance of
aspiration pneumonia on radiographs is typified by an alveolar pattern in the cranioventral lung
fields, whereas non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema tends to organize in the caudodorsal lung fields.
However, some radiographic signs overlap. Patients who are suspected of having pulmonary injury
should be treated with supplementary oxygen. If aspiration pneumonia is suspected, empirical
antibiotic therapy should be provided.
3.4. Extubation
Successful extubation of patients with upper airway obstruction is difficult, as swelling typically
persists for a few days, and anaesthesia reduces tone in the airway muscles. It should only be
attempted once the patient is normothermic, and after diagnostics have been performed, and most
patients will require one or more corrective airway surgeries before they can be extubated successfully.
 Animals 2019, 9, 3
7 of 25
For hypoxaemic patients, the clinician should have a plan in place for providing supplemental
oxygen prior to extubation. This can pose a challenge in brachycephalic patients due to their facial
conformation, and naso-tracheal catheters should be considered [18].
Extubated patients must not be left unattended for the first 12 h, as many will require emergency
re-intubation. If transfer to a 24-h facility is required, it is safest to transport the patient while they
are intubated. Alternatively, a temporary tracheostomy can be placed and the patient recovered from
anaesthetic. In a review of 42 cases where dogs underwent temporary tube tracheostomy, the main
indication was BOAS. Although 81% of dogs survived until tube removal, 86% had complications [19].
The most frequent complications included tube obstruction, dislodgement, aspiration pneumonia,
stoma swelling and bradycardia association with tube manipulation and cleaning.
3.5. Monitoring
Most patients with BOAS presenting with respiratory distress should ultimately be referred for an
airway examination and possible corrective surgery. The exception are those patients who have a clear
initiating cause for their airway obstruction such as severe environmental heat stress, which can be
prevented from occurring again. With or without surgery, owners should be educated on how to limit
the chances of another obstructive episode. Patients should not be exercised on warm or humid days,
should be kept in a cool area of the house in summer months, and be subject to veterinary supervision
immediately if their breathing seems to be more laboured than usual.
4. Sedation and Anaesthesia
The booming popularity of brachycephalic breeds is making the challenge of sedating and
anaesthetizing them reasonably common in daily veterinary practice.
It is important for both
veterinarians and owners to appreciate the risks that are associated with the sedation and anaesthetization
of brachycephalic patients. Regardless of whether they present with airway issues (e.g., laryngeal
examination and tachypnoea) or an unrelated presentation (e.g., intradermal testing, caesarean sections or
stifle surgery), the general approach to sedation and anaesthesia in these breeds is similar.
4.1. Peri-Anaesthetic Morbidity and Mortality
Although there is an overall impression among veterinary anaesthetists that brachycephalic
breeds are predisposed to a greater mortality risk from anaesthesia, no published studies support
this. This might reflect differences in study populations among the different countries where data
was collected, and the periods during data was collected. However, the data does show that for
brachycephalic dogs undergoing surgery for BOAS, 87% have stertor or stridor, 22% have GIT signs at
presentation (vomiting or regurgitation), and 15% have had previous BOAS surgery performed [20].
These data also indicate that 7% of BOAS patients encounter major post-operative complications (requiring
a tracheostomy tube and/or resulting in death or euthanasia) characterised by postoperative radiographic
evidence of pneumonia, and associated with the perioperative use of metoclopramide in infusion.
4.2. Anaesthetic Considerations
Taking into consideration the anatomical attributes of the BOAS and the common comorbidities,
the most important considerations at the time of anaesthesia in brachycephalic dogs are upper
respiratory obstruction and poor oxygenation, poor ventilation and anaesthetic uptake, regurgitation,
agitated recovery and postoperative inflammation.
4.2.1. Upper Respiratory Obstruction and Poor Oxygenation
Most of the anatomical features of BOAS relate to upper respiratory obstruction, and tracheal
intubation can relieve this. Intramuscular sedation is recommended to calm the dog before attempting
to place an IV catheter. A combination of acepromazine (0.01–0.02 mg/kg), medetomidine (5–10 µg/kg),
 Animals 2019, 9, 3

and an opioid produces moderate sedation, with the advantage of facilitating lower doses of sedative
drugs, having a long-lasting effect from the acepromazine, and the possibility of reversing the effect
from the medetomidine at the end of the procedure (to minimise the time to recovery). Pre-oxygenation
is essential in these animals, as tracheal intubation can be difficult, especially in cases of everted
laryngeal saccules or secondary laryngeal paralysis. The induction of anaesthesia by using fast-acting
drugs (e.g. propofol and alfaxalone) is recommended.
4.2.2. Poor Ventilation and Anaesthetic Uptake
Brachycephalic dogs often have some degree of respiratory depression, characterized by a lower
tidal volume and a fast respiratory rate. The decreased tidal volume directly limits alveolar gas, so that
respiratory acidosis is common. Under anaesthesia, the pattern of ventilation remains very similar,
with the addition of further respiratory depression and muscle relaxation from the anaesthetic drugs.
As a result, the uptake of volatile anaesthetics is decreased, and the use of intermittent positive pressure
ventilation (IPPV) is recommended during anaesthesia.
4.2.3. Regurgitation
GIT signs are extremely common in brachycephalic dogs [21]. Short starvation periods are
recommended, because they are associated with lower regurgitation rates (lower cardiac sphincter
tone relates to stomach acidity) [22]. The administration of omeprazole [23] and metoclopramide [24]
is also associated with reduced regurgitation. Maropitant reduces vomiting in dogs, but has no effect
on regurgitation [25]. For elective surgery, it is advisable to commence administration of omeprazole
orally the day before the procedure, to prevent regurgitation, and to administer a metoclopramide
infusion as soon as clinical signs appear.
4.2.4. Agitated Recovery and Postoperative Inflammation
The recovery period is as critical as the period between premedication and tracheal intubation.
The dog must be allowed to recover in a calm environment.
Extubation is normally delayed
until the dog is fully awake and cannot tolerate the tube any longer, to maximize airway patency
and oxygenation. Unless contraindicated, steroids are often administered during the procedure,
or immediately afterwards, to minimize inflammation related to tracheal intubation and any surgical
correction performed in the larynx. Supplemental sedation or oxygenation might be required to
support peripheral perfusion and oxygenation. Monitoring of the haemoglobin oxygen saturation
via a pulse oximeter, and the assessment of the respiratory rate and effort are essential, because
approximately 50% of cases of peri-anaesthetic mortality in dogs occur during recovery [26].
5. Surgical Treatment of Airway Abnormalities
As brachycephalic breeds have become very popular, respiratory distress associated with BOAS
is commonly seen in veterinary practice. Moreover, selection for brachycephalic phenotypes has
worsened the upper airway stenosis, and dogs are consequently affected at a younger age [27].
Early intervention and correction of BOAS abnormalities are recommended for the decrease
or prevention of the progression of airway pathology [28]. The typical short, wide skull leads to
compression of the nasal passages, as well as the obstruction of the nasopharyngeal area by aberrant
turbinates [29,30]. Recent studies using computed tomographic (CT) evaluation of airway dimensions
have shown that Pugs are particularly affected by these skull changes, with the dorsal rotation of
the maxillary bone, whereas French Bulldogs have more severe soft tissues changes, especially the
thickening of the soft palate [31,32]. Primary soft tissue changes include stenotic nares, an elongated
and thickened soft palate, nasopharyngeal mucosal hyperplasia, everted tonsils and macroglossia.
Laryngeal collapse occurs secondary to turbulent airflow and chronic high negative pressures in the
pharynx. The severity of laryngeal collapse is graded from Stage 1 to Stage 3. Everted laryngeal saccules
 Animals 2019, 9, 3
9 of 25
are considered typical of Stage 1. Stage 2 is characterized by a medial displacement of the cuneiform
processes and Stage 3 by a collapse of the corniculate processes of the arytenoid cartilages [30,33].
Dysphagia, vomiting and regurgitation are common clinical signs in brachycephalic breeds.
The prevalence of hiatal hernia and oesophageal disease is high in French Bulldogs, and investigation
for the evidence of gastroesophageal disease should be part of the BOAS diagnostic investigation prior
to treatment [34,35].
5.1. Surgical Therapy
Surgical correction of BOAS requires the patient to be positioned in sternal recumbency, with the
chin resting on a well-padded surface. The maxilla should be suspended by tape hung between two
infusion poles or similar structures. The cuff of the endotracheal tube should be adequately inflated.
5.1.1. Stenotic Nares
Several surgical options have been described for the correction of the stenotic nares. Alaplasty is
the most common procedure, and it involves the excision of a wedge of the ala nasi, with a primary
closure of the defect. The wedge excision can be made vertically, horizontally or laterally. Based on
preference, a scalpel blade, laser or electrocautery can be used. Closure can be performed with a
4-0 or 5-0 monofilament suture, using two or three simple interrupted stitches. The use of a rapidly
absorbable suture abrogates the need for suture removal, which can otherwise necessitate sedation.
5.1.2. Turbinectomy
Laser-assisted turbinectomy (LATE) is aimed at the removal of the aberrant and obstructive parts of
the ventral and medial nasal turbinates. In preliminary reports, LATE, combined with vestibuloplasty and
staphylectomy, demonstrated a 50% reduction of intranasal resistance in brachycephalic breeds [36–38].
5.1.3. Hyperplastic Soft-Palate
The soft palate should be evaluated prior to intubation, with the head and tongue in a neutral
position. In this position, a normal soft palate should not extend past the tip of the epiglottis, or the
middle to caudal aspect of the tonsillar crypt [28,33].
The most common surgical technique is intended to shorten the soft palate by excision of its caudal
portion (staphylectomy), to prevent it from obstructing the rima glottidis during inspiration. Different
landmarks for incisions have been recommended, including the tip of the epiglottis, the middle to
caudal aspect of the tonsils, or more recently, a CT-enabled pre-calculated distance from the pterygoid
processes. During staphylectomy, the caudal border of the soft palate is prehended with an Allis
forceps before resection of excessive length is performed with a scalpel blade, metzenbaum scissors,
monopolar electrocoagulation, CO2 laser, diode laser, or bipolar sealing device [39].
As the staphylectomy does not address the soft palate thickening and consequent nasopharyngeal
obstruction, a folded palatoplasty technique has been described to correct both the excessive length
and the thickness of the soft palate. In this technique, the soft palate is made thinner by an excision of
a portion of its oropharyngeal mucosa and the underlying soft tissues. The palate is then shortened by
being folded onto itself until the caudal nasopharyngeal opening is visible transorally [30,40].
5.1.4. Everted Laryngeal Saccules
Excision of everted laryngeal saccules remains controversial [41–43]. However, they should
be removed when the eversion contributes significantly to the obstruction of the rima glottidis.
Complications, such as laryngeal webbing and regrowth, can occur [44].
5.1.5. Laryngeal Collapse
The treatment of laryngeal collapse is considered only when clinical signs do not improve
with appropriate treatment of the nares and soft palate. Laser-assisted partial arytenoidectomy
 Animals 2019, 9, 3
10 of 25
and arytenoid lateralization may also merit consideration, while a permanent tracheostomy may be
considered palliative [41].
5.2. Prognosis After Surgical Therapy
Around 90 per cent of BAS dogs experience significant improvement of respiratory function
with surgery [30]. However, despite appropriate surgical treatment, respiratory function remains
compromised in 60% of dogs [38]. Younger age, normal body condition score, presence of laryngeal
collapse and traditional multilevel surgery versus modified multilevel surgery are reported as negative
prognostic factors after surgical treatment [45]. Age was positively associated with the odds of
temporary tracheostomy tube placement in dogs after BOAS surgery, indicating that early identification
and surgery may be beneficial [46]. Perioperative mortality rates have improved to less than 4% in
recent studies [47].
6. Effects of Brachycephaly on the Brain and Associated Neurologic Abnormalities
The main neurologic disorder in dogs associated with brachycephaly is syringomyelia (SM),
which is most commonly accompanied by a Chiari-like malformation of the skull (CM). SM is a
cavitatory accumulation of fluid within the spinal cord [48]. Syrinx formation may occur over several
segments of the spinal cord, or extend to its entire length, and is prevalent in the cervical spinal cord of
brachycephalic breeds. While SM can occur as a sequel to other spinal cord pathologies, it is recognised
most commonly as a developmental abnormality in breeds with a shorter than normal basi-cranium
(skull base), which is typical of brachycephalic and many miniature breeds.
Shortening of the basicranium is thought to reflect premature closure (synchondrosis) of the
centres of endochondral ossification within the basisphenoid and basioccipital bones [49]. Shortening
of the basicranial axis may lead to compensatory changes in other cranial bones, including widening
and doming of the skull, and may contribute to neural overcrowding. CM (Chiari-like malformation)
with abnormality of the occipital bone, resulting in compression of the contents of the caudal
fossa (cerebellum and brain stem) and herniation of the cerebellum through the foramen magnum,
is probably multifactorial. The contributing factors proposed include increased cerebellar volume,
with failure of the caudal cranial fossa to reach a commensurate size [50], and kinking of the medulla at
the cranio-cervical junction [51]. CM has been described most commonly in the CKCS, and is reported
to occur in 100%of dogs of this breed [52]. SM may also be seen in dogs with a shortened basi-cranium
without CM, including overtly brachycephalic breeds such as the Griffon Bruxellois [53,54] and
miniature breeds, such as Pomeranians and Chihuahuas [55]. Increasingly, it is being reported in
other toy breeds including Boston Terriers, Affenpinschers, Yorkshire Terriers, Pomeranians and
Chihuahuas [55–57]. SM in all of these breeds is believed to develop, due to altered cerebrospinal
fluid (CSF) flow at the craniocervical junction [48]. In miniature breeds, other cranio-cervical junction
anomalies, including abnormalities of C1 and C2, may contribute to the clinical signs [55]. Affected
dogs may have concurrent ventriculomegaly.
CKCSs and Griffons Bruxellois are highly predisposed to SM, with a prevalence in dogs without
recognised clinical signs being estimated at 25% at 12 months of age, 70% at six years or older in
CKCSs [58] and 52% in Griffons (of varying ages) [54]. The incidence of dogs showing clinical signs
associated with CM and/or SM is much lower. CM and SM have a moderately high heritability in
CKCSs [59], and genetic factors are likely in other affected breeds [60] and many of their crosses [61].
SM is almost certainly associated directly with skull conformation. The mode of inheritance is unclear,
but it does not appear to be simple. Phenotypic screening of CKCSs and Griffons Bruxellois in the
last 10 years seems to have reduced the incidence of severely affected dogs in breeding lines, where
screening with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been undertaken, but has not eliminated the
condition [51,62].
 Animals 2019, 9, 3

6.1. Clinical Signs and Diagnosis
Some features of CM may be slowly progressive with time, and include changes in foramen
magnum height, and herniation of the cerebellum [63]. Clinical signs, manifesting as episodic apparent
neck pain, may be associated with CM without SM [48]. SM is progressive, and clinical signs are
generally more severe, but they may not emerge until the affected animals are over four years of age.
More severely affected dogs may present at a younger age and, on occasions, severe clinical signs may
be seen in dogs under one year of age [48].
The most common presenting clinical signs of SM are cervical pain, which may be episodic,
cervical hyperaesthesia, characterised by persistent scratching of one area of the shoulder, neck,
sternum, ear or flank [48]. “Phantom” scratching often occurs when dog is moving or physically
stimulated (e.g., by touching the neck), and is seen most commonly on one side of the body.
This scratching is thought to be the result of abnormal sensation (allodynia), but may represent
an abnormal scratch reflex [48]. Other neurological deficits include thoracic limb weakness (such
that forelimbs splay laterally) and mild hindlimb ataxia. Other demonstrable neurologic deficits are
uncommon, except in severe disease or in dogs with concurrent cranio-cervical junction anomalies.
Regardless of the cause of SM, scoliosis (lateral deformity of the spinal column) may be evident on
radiographs. A diagnosis of CM and/or SM is made after MRI of the brain and spinal cord.
6.2. Treatment
In dogs, SM progression may occur over years, and sometimes it may never be associated with
clinical signs. CM and/or syringomyelia is commonly found as an incidental finding in affected breeds
without clinical signs during the investigation of other neurological diseases. Clinical signs are more
likely to be seen in dogs with larger and asymmetric syrinxes [64]. It is not predictable which dogs will
ever exhibit clinical signs associated with CM or SM.
For dogs showing clinical signs, such as spinal hyperaesthesia, persistent scratching and/or
neurological deficits, low-dose prednisolone and/or treatment with proton pump inhibitors (such as
omeprazole) can be used to reduce CSF production [48]. Gabapentin (or pregabalin) is often used in
the medical treatment of dogs with spinal pain or persistent scratching [48]. The use of prednisolone in
the longer term is reserved for dogs with signs that are unresponsive to these drugs, due to potential
adverse effects, including iatrogenic hyperadrenocorticism and gastric ulceration. Non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or amitriptyline can also be used treat those dogs with spinal
pain as the predominant clinical sign. Surgical decompression of the foramen magnum has also been
proposed to treat dogs that are unresponsive to medical management [65], although no technique
has been shown to demonstrate syrinx resolution [66]. The prognosis for affected dogs is variable.
However, for those with marked scoliosis, intractable spinal pain and/or neurologic deficits that are
unresponsive to medical management, the prognosis is poor.
In affected breeds, MRI screening of potential breeding animals is recommended [48]. Selecting
for a non-exaggerated skull conformation (notably for a less broad, less domed, longer skull) is also
recommended. Two significant risk factors that are associated with the development of CM/SM in the
conformation of the CKCS are the extent of the brachycephaly, and the distribution of the cranium
(higher cephalic index with a broader, shorter head and rostrocaudal doming [67]. The more the
cranium (top of the skull) is distributed caudally rather than rostrally, the more dogs seem to be
spared syrinx development [67]. Any change in preferred skull conformation will depend, in part,
on the pet-buying public and possibly dog-show judges being educated about the health risks that are
associated with the wide, flat face that has been regarded to be more appealing.
6.3. Other Neurological Conditions
Brachycephalic screw-tailed dogs, including the French Bulldog, Pug and British Bulldog,
are commonly affected by vertebral malformations, including hemivertebra, and spinal curvature
 Animals 2019, 9, 3
12 of 25
abnormalities, including kyphosis and scoliosis [68–70].
Multiple malformations are common.
These may lead to vertebral misalignment, stenosis and instability, and potentially intervertebral
disc extrusion. For example, French Bulldogs with kyphosis were almost twice as likely to suffer from
intervertebral disc extrusion, particularly in the thoracolumbar region [69]. In the same study, spinal
scoliosis was associated with a higher risk of caudal lumbar intervertebral disc extrusion. Clinical
signs of neurologic dysfunction vary with the location of vertebral malformation. Clinical signs
that are associated with thoracic vertebral malformation include paraparesis and pelvic limb ataxia,
which may be acute or chronic [70]. Some dogs may be non-ambulatory. Screw-tailed breeds have
an increased incidence of sacrocaudal malformations, which may be associated with urinary and/or
faecal incontinence. Some dogs may require surgery to relieve spinal cord compression. Vertebral
malformations including spina bifida may be associated with other neural abnormalities, including
meningocoeles and dermoid sinuses, with varying clinical signs [71].
7. Dermatological Conditions
Selection for brachycephalic appearance and screw tail has resulted in deep skin folds and
subsequent intertrigo.
Consequently, brachycephalic dog breeds share a well-documented list
of dermatological disorders, including facial and tail fold intertrigo, pattern baldness, atopic
dermatitis, demodicosis, Malassezia dermatitis, mast cell tumours, muzzle and pedal folliculitis and
furunculosis [72]. In addition, individual breeds have specific dermatological disorders, including
primary secretory otitis media (POSM) in the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, and flank alopecia in the
English Bulldog and Boxer.
In the study by Webb Milum et al, their original aim was to identify a normal, healthy population
of English Bulldogs without signs of dermatitis (pododermatitis, pruritus) or gastrointestinal disease,
and to compare them with a population of English Bulldogs with dermatological disease [73].
They evaluated 34 English Bulldogs at two dog shows, and all dogs had evidence of some form
of dermatitis, many had a history of facial pruritus and over 50% had been recently been medicated
for dermatology conditions. The study could not be completed, as they were unable to find an English
Bulldog that was free of dermatological or GIT disease.
The low genetic diversity in this breed not only perpetuates dogs that have been bred with
physical abnormalities that are associated with brachycephalic conformation, but also impacts on the
genes that regulate their normal immune responses [74].
Many of the dermatological diseases that commonly occur in the brachycephalic breeds require
long-term management, such as allergen-specific immunotherapy for atopy, control of staphylococcal
and Malassezia infections, both systemically and topically, surgical resection of pedal furuncles of the
paws (interdigital cysts), parasiticides for demodicosis, and/or topical therapy or surgical resection of
folds for facial and tail fold intertrigo.
While demodex mites are considered part of the normal skin flora in dogs, they become pathogenic
when the immune system is compromised and mite numbers increase. This results in inflammation
and infection. Isoxazoline parasiticides were initially designed to offer flea and tick protection, but they
are now recognized (and registered in some countries) for treatment against Demodicosis [75].
In canine atopic dermatitis, clinical lesions are found on the pinnae, flexor surface of the elbows,
muzzle and glabrous areas. It is often complicated by the presence of secondary Malassezia dermatitis
and otitis, staphylococcal infections, and defects in the epidermal barrier function [72]. Treatment
guidelines have been updated in 2015 by the International Committee on Allergic Diseases of Animals,
ICADA [76].
Malassezia dermatitis is most commonly found on the paws, lip folds, ear canals, perineal area,
folds and ventral neck. Lesions are characterised by pruritus, inflammation, hyperpigmentation and
lichenification and a greasy exudate. Successful management requires the control of the primary
disease, and a combination of systemic and topical therapy [77].

8. Other Conditions
Brachycephalic facial conformation can cause lagophthalmos (the inability to close the eyelids
completely), and predisposes affected dogs to corneal ulceration, a painful eye condition that can
result in scarring, corneal perforation or permanent blindness. In a study of 700 dogs, 31 were
affected by corneal ulcers, with Pugs being the most commonly affected [78]. Brachycephalic dogs
(those with a craniofacial ration of <0.5) were 20 times more likely to suffer corneal ulceration than
non-brachycephalic breeds, while those with a 10% increase in relative eyelid aperture—a feature seen
and encouraged by breed standards of brachycephalic breeds—were more than three times likely to
suffer from corneal ulceration. Visible sclera was associated with almost three times the rate of corneal
ulcers, while dogs with nasal folds were five times more likely to suffer from corneal ulcers. Affected
dogs may require medical management, and/or surgery.
Brachycephalic breeds may experience a higher incidence of orthopaedic conditions. The French
Bulldog is among the breeds with the highest incidences of patellar luxation, an orthopedic condition
which can lead to lameness, osteoarthritis and pain [79]. The prevalence of patellar luxation was 4%
in French Bulldogs, 3.8% in CKCS, 3.5% in Pugs and 2.9% in Bulldogs, compared with an overall
prevalence of 1.3%. Affected dogs may require medical management, and/or surgery.
9. Behavioural Consequences of Canine Brachycephaly
Dogs vary in their morphology more than any other mammalian species. Because there is a
wide spectrum of head shapes, with so many permutations of skull width and length [80], it may be
simplistic to categorise animals as either brachycephalic or non-brachycephalic. Other terms have been
used to identify non-brachycephalic breeds include mesocephalic (effectively mid-ranged skull) and
dolichocephalic (long-skulled). However, it has been argued that even these three categories of skull
shape are simply arbitrary, and that a sliding scale of cephalic index (CI, a measure of the ratio between
skull width and length) is a more elegant means of studying the skull differences among dogs and their
consequences. Breed groupings and genetic clusters only partially explain CI differences. This suggests
that the three categories of canine skull (dolichocephalic, mesocephalic and brachycephalic) are overly
arbitrary, and that CI is a better metric of this dimension than three categories, the ranges for which
many authors disagree [81]. There is evidence of sexual dimorphism for head length in five breeds,
head width in 10 breeds and CI in two breeds [82].
While fashion influences the popularity of certain breeds [83], the rise of brachycephalic dogs (and
the concomitant increase in CI) may also reflect the behavioural appeal of some breeds [3]. That said,
it is unclear how much behaviour has influenced breed demand. Of course, much of what veterinarians
know about dog-keeping and dog behaviour is based on the assumption that dogs do not have extreme
head-shapes. Unless one has lived with a brachycephalic dog, one may underestimate the effects a
compromised airway can have on canine behaviour, welfare and quality of life.
Dogs with short skulls are prone to prominent facial skin folds. In addition to predisposing
dogs to dermatitis and exposure keratitis [84], prominent facial skin folds may also affect the dog’s
ability to lift its lips to signal fear and aggression to conspecifics, as has been described in neotenised
(or paedomorphic) dogs [85]. That said, the extent of any social deficit associated with brachycephalism
has yet to be defined. Other consequences of brachycephalism include crowded dentition, which may
compromise the dog’s ability to chew; this may have consequences for stress reduction, since it has
been suggested that chewing is a fundamental canine stress-coping mechanism [86].
If dogs’ physical ability to see, chew and signal effectively is affected by skull shape, so too is
brain morphology. Regodon et al., [87] showed that, with reduced skull length in dogs, the cranium
becomes more perpendicular relative to the facial axis and leads to an increase of structural disorders
such as hydrocephaly [88] (see Section 3 above) and occipital dysplasia [89]. Midline sagittal MRI
slices of canine brains across a broad range of CI (cephalic index) have revealed that cranial diversity
is associated with systematic differences in brain morphology [90].
 Animals 2019, 9, 3
14 of 25
Increasing CI is associated with a progressive ventral pitching of the primary brain axis, as well
as with a ventral shift in the olfactory lobe position [90]. This reflects an extraordinary degree of
intra-species variability in brain anatomy that appears to be independent of brain size or bodyweight
differences, and is primarily driven by human-driven selection pressure. The olfactory bulb of dogs
with high CI seems to have migrated to a potential space ventral to the orbital frontal cortex, thus
liberating the anterior pole for the normal development of the frontal cortex. In contrast, dogs with
low CI may have capacity in the cranial vault to allow the olfactory bulb to develop almost directly
anterior to the frontal lobe [90].
There is a strong correlation between the distribution of retinal ganglion cells and CI in dogs,
which is likely to affect vision. This, in turn, may contribute to behavioural differences. The ganglion
cells of dogs with a high CI are concentrated in the central circular area of the retina, which provides
good visual acuity in the centre of the visual field [91]. In contrast, those of the dogs with a low CI
are arranged in a linear fashion across the retina, to create a so-called visual streak that is thought to
provide excellent peripheral vision.
To explore the relationships between morphology and behaviour, data on breed-specific CI, height
and bodyweight (based on a survey of >1000 dogs) have been integrated with owners’ reports of
canine behaviour (n = 8301) across 49 different breeds [92]. Stepwise backward regression has revealed
that across breeds, eight behavioural traits correlate with either CI alone (n = 3), bodyweight-and-skull
shape combined (n = 2) or height-and-skull shape combined (n = 3). These results demonstrate that the
canine head shape, and therefore brain morphology, co-varies with behaviour. Specifically, these results
have shown that, compared with long-skulled dogs, short-skulled dogs are significantly more likely
to show compulsive staring, self-grooming, allo-grooming and dog-directed aggression. In contrast,
they are significantly less likely to display behaviours such as stealing food, stranger-directed fear,
persistent barking and chasing [92]. Some of these traits may reflect the retinal and brain effects of
a high CI, and may even begin to explain some of the charm and appeal of the currently popular
short-skulled breeds.
Brachycephaly may restrict the ability of dogs to exercise. Exercise intolerance reduces the
dog’s ability to shed excessive weight but also to express its telos (or dogginess) (for a discussion
of telos, see Rollin [93]. Brachycephalic dogs experience increasing respiratory effort at rest and
likely air hunger, an unpleasant negative welfare state, during exertion [94]. Brachycephalic dogs
are less capable than non-brachycephalic dogs of thermoregulating during periods of heat stress,
with a significantly greater increase in respiratory rate as ambient temperatures rise, compared with
healthy non-brachycephalic dogs [5]. In a study using whole-body plethysmography to continuously
measure respiration as ambient temperature was increased, five of 52 brachycephalic dogs and none
of 53 non-brachycephalic dogs, were withdrawn from heat treatment because they showed signs of
respiratory distress [5]. The authors found that body condition score was positively associated with
body temperature (independent of environmental conditions) and negatively associated with tidal
volume, suggesting that overweight brachycephalic dogs are less tolerant of heat stress.
When assessed using airway auscultation pre- and post-exercise (a gentle three-minute trot),
and whole-body barometric plethysmography, approximately 50% of Pugs and French Bulldogs, and
45% of Bulldogs had clinically significant airway disease [8]. A survey of owners of 61 Pugs and 39
French Bulldogs referred for surgical treatment of BOAS revealed that 88% of brachycephalic dogs had
severe exercise intolerance and required prolonged recovery time following exercise, 56% experienced
sleep problems, and 50% had significant sensitivity to heat [95]. The mean age of dogs at the time
the survey was completed was 3.33 years (a range of eight months to 11 years), with the mean age
of onset of signs being 1.12 years (a range of three months to four years). Many affected dogs had
developed strategies to avoid airway obstruction during sleep, including adopting a sitting position
while sleeping, elevating their chin, or sleeping with a toy between their teeth to keep the mouth open
to compensate for nasal obstruction. According to the survey, 10% of dogs could sleep only with an
open mouth.
 Animals 2019, 9, 3
15 of 25
Airway abnormalities, coupled with a propensity for heat stress, may prevent brachycephalic
dogs from safely participating in household activities, including vacations. According to data collected
by the US Department of Transport, of the 122 dogs that died while being transported as cargo in
commercial aircraft between 2005 and 2010, approximately half were brachycephalic breeds, the English
Bulldogs (25 deaths), Pugs (11 deaths) and French Bulldogs (six deaths) accounting for the highest
numbers [96]. For this reason, many airlines have placed a ban or heavy restrictions on the transport of
brachycephalic breeds. For example, Qantas does not permit the transport of pure-bred brachycephalic
breeds, including Bulldogs (French or English), Pugs, Pekingese, Boston terriers and Japanese chin,
on flights longer than five sectors, or more than two sectors per journey. If transported, these dogs
must be contained in an approved crate that is twice the size of the minimum requirement for normal
dogs. For international flights of over five hours, owners must submit a form of acknowledgement
and indemnity [97].
In summary, there are many ways in which increasing CI may compromise the dog’s ability to
behave as a normal dog would, and as dogs have evolved and been domesticated to.
Canine and human co-evolution have disclosed remarkable morphological plasticity in dogs [98].
For the owners of French Bulldogs, high levels of problems are negatively associated with plans to
acquire the same breed again [99]. This may have implications for the veterinary caseloads of the future.
Whether the recent selection of dogs with progressively diminished CI has reached physiological limits
is controversial [84]. The short life expectancy of dogs with a very high CI [7] suggests that we may
have even exceeded these limits.
10. Ethical Challenges Associated with Brachycephalic Breeds
The brachycephalic patient, and indeed other patients with extreme phenotypes due to selective
breeding, may place veterinarians in ethically challenging situations when approached to assist in the
treatment and breeding of affected animals [100]. In drawing attention to BOAS, veterinarians may
appear to be critical of the very features that clients find most endearing about their companion animals.
In addition, veterinarians may fear that, in drawing an owner’s attention to the severity and
chronicity of clinical signs that the dog has been and is experiencing, they may be perceived to
be judging and therefore alienating clients, as well as the breeders of these animals. In addition,
veterinarians may have a conflict of interest if they draw an income from treating BOAS. For example, writing
anonymously in The Guardian, one veterinarian suggests that it is this conflict of interest which prevents
veterinarians from speaking publicly about the negative health and welfare impacts of brachycephaly:
“ . . . the vast majority of us work in general practice and our income is based on mending
people’s animals and getting paid for it, and, like it or not, a large number of those clients
have brachycephalic dogs. In my practice alone we have a number of pug, shih-tzu and
bulldog breeders and dozens of owners with squashed-nosed pets . . . If I stood up and told
the truth about these breeds, I would immediately alienate them and they would up sticks
and move to the neighbouring practice where the vet was not as outspoken. Vets in general
practice simply cannot afford to be honest and to speak out. You would be hard-pushed to
find a general practitioner who likes the concept of a brachycephalic dog but you would be
equally hard-pushed to find one being openly critical of them because this would put their
livelihood on the line.” [101]
That author’s untested hypothesis is that being critical of brachycephalic breeds will alienate
clients who are owners of brachycephalic dogs, potentially eliminating the opportunity for the
veterinarian to have any influence on the dog’s health or welfare. A further implication is that
in such cases, a veterinarian’s secondary interest, that is, drawing an income, takes primacy over their
primary professional considerations—the interests of the animal and the client.
The response of veterinarians to brachycephalic patients depends on how they perceive their role.
If they believe that their role begins and ends with treating the individual patient to the best of their
 Animals 2019, 9, 3
16 of 25
ability, they can treat BOAS as a congenital disease, developing and refining their skills to provide
the best possible outcome for each patient. In this narrow conception of the professional role, the
stakeholders include the dogs (whose clinical signs are managed), the clients (whose feelings are dealt
with sensitively) and the veterinarians (who may alleviate suffering and are paid for their efforts). Even
within this conception, Hernandez and colleagues [102] argue that veterinarians have a professional
duty to “speak up” about animal welfare issues, despite the risk of having uncomfortable conversations.
Similarly, Coghlan [103] argues that companion animal veterinarians are ethically obliged to act as strong
patient advocates, in that they must first consider the interests of the patient they are treating. To ensure
appropriate and timely treatment, and to optimize welfare, it is in the interests of the patient for the client
to appreciate the degree of suffering that is associated with BOAS, the pathophysiology of the condition,
and steps to take to minimise suffering and to improve health and welfare.
However, it can be argued that veterinarians have obligations extending beyond the confines of
the consultation room. For example, in New South Wales, veterinarians swear an oath to “practice
veterinary science ethically and conscientiously for the benefit of animal welfare, animal and human
health, users of veterinary services and the community” [104]. Similarly, veterinarians in the UK
swear to uphold their responsibilities to “the public, my clients, the profession, and the Royal
College of Veterinary Surgeons” [104]. Such oaths suggest that simply serving the interests of the
client, the individual patient and themselves and/or employer abrogates veterinarians’ professional
responsibilities to the wider animal population and community.
As stated in the British Veterinary Association’s Animal Welfare Strategy, pointedly titled “Vets
Speaking Up for Animal Welfare”:
“Reputationally, if [vets] don’t speak out about systemic animal welfare problems or if we only
do so reactively once a critical mass of favourable public opinion has been achieved, then this can lead
to accusations of weak morality and, worse, complicity in animal welfare problems” [105].
The failure of veterinarians to speak up about welfare problems that are associated with selective
breeding is cited as an example. If, as the Strategy suggests, our duty as professionals extends beyond
the individual vet–client–patient relationship, that is, promoting animal welfare on a broader scale,
we are obliged to do what we can to optimise the welfare of the individual animal presented to us,
as well as evaluate and act on systemic animal welfare issues at the level of the surrounding community,
and through professional associations “to achieve political impact and challenge societal norms” [105].
Veterinary oaths and codes of conduct hold that veterinarians should be of good character.
In terms of ethical theories, this is aligned with virtue ethics. Virtues are morally relevant, reliable
character traits that we expect in persons of good character.
Beauchamp and Childress [106] identify care, as well as five focal virtues, as being important
for medical professionals, which may be applied in relation to veterinarian’s obligations towards
brachycephalic dogs, as outlined in Table 2.
Table 2. Beauchamp and Childress’ focal virtues for medical professionals, and how these may manifest

attachments or inducements.
Trustworthiness
The veterinarian can be trusted to give an honest, informed opinion about the patient’s condition, potential causes and
contributing factors, and prognosis, and to declare any conflicts of interest.
Integrity
The veterinarian is faithful to his or her moral values, and will defend these when necessary.
Conscientiousness
The veterinarian works conscientiously to do what is right: to provide the best possible care to the individual patient,
and to future patients by remaining up-to-date with scientific evidence. The conscientious veterinarian strives to
prevent disease at the level of the individual, as well as that of the population.

Consequentialism is a category of ethical theories that judge the rightness or wrongness of an
action by its consequences. Utilitarianism is a branch of consequentialism that determines the rightness
or a wrongness of an action by its ability to maximise well-being, or to minimize suffering.
There is a real concern that, in failing to speak publicly about the health and welfare impacts of
brachycephaly and other breed-associated conditions, veterinarians perpetuate the problem. In a UK
study, 58% of owners of dogs with BOAS reported that their dog did not have a breathing problem,
despite reporting a high frequency and severity of clinical signs [107]. This ignorance is perpetuated
if veterinarians accept signs of BOAS as being normal for the breed [8]. Without an appreciation
of the health and welfare implications of BOAS, owners may not seek treatment for affected dogs.
Furthermore, potential owners may select affected dogs as companion animals, and affected dogs
may continue to be used for breeding. Such consequences would increase overall suffering. One
study found that the experience of health and behaviour problems, including breed-related problems,
while their dogs did not impact the owner’s likelihood of adopting a dog of the same breed again [99].
The one exception was French Bulldogs, where the extent of health problems did decrease the owner’s
intention to acquire the same breed again. This may be because appearance is a stronger influential
factor in choosing a dog than health and longevity. For example, despite an increase in media coverage
of the link between conformation and health problems, and the increased availability of educational
resources for potential puppy buyers, a UK study found that persons who purchased a brachycephalic
dog prioritized appearance over health and longevity [108].
Because of the increasing popularity of brachycephalic breeds, BOAS affects larger numbers of
animals than ever before, and it has the potential to continue to do so, due to its association with
brachycephalic conformation. Furthermore, it may have severe adverse effects on affected animals for
extended periods [107]. Again, this increases overall suffering.
Utilitarian frameworks hold that we should aim to minimise costs and maximise benefits. One of
the best-known utilitarian frameworks is the 3Rs of replacement, reduction and refinement, used to
assess proposed animal experiments [109,110]. According to this framework, animals may be used in
experiments only if welfare costs are minimised whilst scientific benefits are maximised. The benefits
must not be trivial [110]. When it comes to breeding brachycephalic dogs, it could be argued that the
animals bear most of the welfare costs, while the benefits to humans of a fashionable animal are trivial.
According to this framework, if animals are to be “used” as companions, welfare costs or harms should
be minimised to the greatest degree possible.
As has been argued by Rollin, our predominant social ethic combines utilitarianism with
deontology, a category of ethical frameworks that judge rightness and wrongness against moral
rules. It has been argued that the “five freedoms of animal welfare” (freedom from hunger and thirst;
discomfort; pain, injury and disease; fear and distress; and freedom to express normal behaviour)
function as rights [111]. In other words, it is generally held that, at a minimum, animals that are kept
and used by humans are afforded such freedoms.
The previous discussion demonstrates that dogs with BOAS do not enjoy freedom from discomfort,
nor freedom from pain, injury and disease, and they do not enjoy the freedom to express normal
behaviour. According to both deontological and utilitarian ethical frameworks, therefore, the breeding
of dogs with extreme phenotypes, including BOAS, cannot be justified, and further, it must be
discouraged because of our duties to companion animals.
11. The Veterinarian’s Role
Veterinarians are responsible for the health and welfare of individual animals, but are also
expected to be involved in policy discussions regarding health and welfare, including breeding
practices [112]. The veterinarian can address the issue of extreme brachycephaly at the level of the
patient, client, breeder, community and politically.
As discussed, at the level of the patient, the veterinarian must be able to identify and treat
suffering. This requires an understanding of the pathophysiology of BOAS, as well as the welfare
 Animals 2019, 9, 3

implications. When advising owners about selecting a companion animal, veterinarians can educate
them about the health and welfare risks of extreme morphology and inherited disorders, as well as
potential financial implications, and recommend breeds that are fit for function. When presented
with a brachycephalic patient, the veterinarian should identify and explain all brachycephaly-related
clinical signs and recommend early intervention for animals at risk of BOAS (or refer appropriately).
The veterinarian can recommend lifestyle changes for animals at risk of BOAS, including managing
food intake, maintaining an appropriate body condition score, avoiding over-exertion and minimising
exposure to high temperatures and high humidity [8]. Veterinarians can perform surgery and treatment,
as described in Section 5, to improve patient breathing or to address specific problems such as
lagopthalmos (inability to blink completely) [78]. However, Packer argues that in the longer term,
veterinarians can do more than simply surgically intervene to return individual dogs to a lower risk
morphology [78].
At the level of the client, the veterinarian should be frank and honest, providing an evidence-based
explanation of concerns. Materials such as those produced for the joint AVA (Australian Veterinary
Association) and RSPCA (Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals) Australia Love
is Blind campaign may be shared with clients http://www.ava.com.au/loveisblind/resources-vets.
Practicing sensitive, open communication around a range of issues (from breaking bad news, discussing
companion animal obesity and communicating frankly about terminal or chronic conditions) is
important.
It is acceptable for a professional to make strong statements about animal welfare.
Veterinarians are well placed to advise pet owners on breed-related health and welfare issues. However,
many pet owners acquire their pets prior to visiting a veterinarian, so that many relevant conversations
occur post-purchase. Breed-related conditions, the likely associated costs and the welfare impact on
the pet in the short- and long-term should be discussed as early as possible with clients.
Where breeders of extreme brachycephalic animals are clients, it is important to help them to
improve the health of their animals. This can be achieved by strongly recommending the neutering of
animals with BOAS, or those requiring caesarean sections, and stating that this recommendation is
based on health and welfare grounds. Veterinarians may refuse to participate in artificial insemination
and other breeding services, if breeders are unwilling to address the health issues of their breeding
stock. Veterinarians may also carry out exercise tolerance tests and grading of brachycephaly and
participate in health schemes in conjunction with kennel clubs [2]. Practices can enrol in clinical
surveillance programs such as VetCompass to contribute to the clinical evidence base, to facilitate
monitoring and management of inherited conditions.
At the level of the community, veterinarians can promote pre-purchase consultations to
prospective owners, and outline health problems associated with brachycephalic conformation.
In addition, they can avoid posting brachycephalic breeds on social media and marketing material.
Veterinarians can support breeders and breed associations that are determined to genuinely improve
the health of welfare of these dogs.
At the level of the profession, veterinarians can take an active role in their professional association
by working with kennel clubs to promote the need for change in breed standards, and to be
involved in initiatives to address the health and welfare of breeds [105], including their involvement
in organisations such as the UK’s Advisory Council on the Welfare Issues of Dog Breeding and
the International Partnership for Dogs. Some breeds may not retain enough genetic diversity to
permit the correction of the extreme brachycephalic phenotype and its associated health problems.
A genetic assessment of the English Bulldog identified low genetic diversity, concluding that the
possibility of using reverse selection to improve the health of purebred English Bulldogs, select against
deleterious simple recessive traits, and/or accommodating further genetic manipulations without
further decreasing genetic diversity was questionable [74]. The authors concluded that judicious
outcrossing may be required to address these concerns. Such measures should be investigated and
discussed with kennel clubs.

Professional associations can educate the wider public by providing education programs and
indirectly, by not promoting extremely brachycephalic breeds.
In 2017, the British Veterinary
Association announced that it would no longer use images of brachycephalic breeds in advertising to
prevent normalisation of their associated health issues and to reduce demands for these breeds [2,113].
The AVA took a similar position the same year, also avoiding the use of images of other breeds with
exaggerated features, such as Shar-peis and Dachshunds [114]. In addition, professional associations
can lobby for strengthened animal welfare legislation. A number of countries, including Austria,
Germany and Switzerland [115–117], have introduced “anti-qualzucht” (“torture breeding”) clauses in
animal welfare legislation, which on some interpretations, makes it illegal to knowingly breed animals
that are likely to experience pain, distress or harm (for example, shortness of breath). Because only
a small percentage of the canine brachycephalic population is registered, efforts must be made to
crack-down on irresponsible backyard breeders and puppy farms that are focused on profits over
welfare [8]. This may require changes in legislation around the breeding of dogs.
In January 2018, New Zealand auction and classified advertising website Trade Me (www.trademe.
co.nz) announced a ban on the sale of Pugs, British Bulldogs and French Bulldogs, and their crossbreeds,
on the grounds that breeders cannot claim puppies are 100 per cent healthy due to the high risk of
BOAS in these breeds [118]. In an explanation posted on its website, the company stated that while
it is likely that the animals will be sold elsewhere online, “Trade Me does not want to contribute to
this problem” and sees its stance as “an opportunity to educate potential buyers”, and called for the
Government to consider regulatory intervention to address BOAS in these breeds [118]. Veterinarians
and associations were consulted prior to the ban.
In summary, veterinarians have a professional and moral obligation to work to prevent and
minimise the negative health and welfare impacts of extreme morphology and inherited disorders by
working at the level of the patient, their communities and with breed and professional associations.
Because of the health and welfare costs of BOAS and other conditions associated with the extreme
brachycephalic phenotype, coupled with the growing popularity of these breeds, veterinarians must
take a strong position against perpetuating these phenotypes.
12. Conclusions
Breeding of dogs with extreme brachycephaly is associated with health and welfare problems,
including acute and chronic respiratory distress, with the potential need for airway stabilization and
surgical intervention to manage BOAS. In addition, brachycephalic breeds present an anaesthetic
challenge. Extreme brachycephalic confirmation is associated with non-airway related conditions,
including neurological, dermatological, ophthalmic and orthopedic conditions.
In addition to
impacting the health and welfare of these dogs, owners may incur significant costs in treating them.
The growing popularity of these breeds suggests that companion animal owners do not appreciate the
enormity of these health and welfare costs. Veterinarians have a professional and moral obligation to
prevent and minimise the negative health and welfare impacts of extreme morphology and inherited
disorders and must address extreme brachycephalic conformation, not only at the level of the patient,
but also as a systemic welfare problem.
