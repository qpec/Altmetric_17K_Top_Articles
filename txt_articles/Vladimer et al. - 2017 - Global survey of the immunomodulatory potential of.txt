 small chemical molecules as defined by their ability to alter the cell-cell interactions among 
peripheral mononuclear leukocytes ex vivo, using automated microscopy and population-wide 
single-cell image analysis. Surprisingly, some 10% of the agents tested affected these cell-cell 
interactions differentially. The results accurately recapitulated known immunomodulatory drug 
classes, and revealed several clinically approved drugs that unexpectedly harbor the ability to 
modulate the immune system, potentially contributing to their physiological mechanism of action. 
For instance, the kinase inhibitor crizotinib promoted T-cell interactions with monocytes as well as 
with cancer cells, through inhibition of MST1R/RON (macrophage-stimulating protein receptor) 
and subsequent upregulation of MHC (major histocompatibility complex) expression. The 
approach offers an attractive platform for the personalized identification and characterization of 
immunomodulatory therapeutics.
Introduction
High-content screening using automated fluorescent microscopy has allowed us to 
objectivize and quantify a great variety of cellular parameters, providing an attractive 
platform to perform genetic or chemical perturbation screens at unprecedented accuracy and 
robustness due to the statistical power derived from the large number of events monitored. In 
particular, the approach has enabled the visualization of the influence of cell-cell and cell-
microenvironment interactions, which contribute to population-level phenotypes 1. It has 
further facilitated the high-throughput screening of co-culture systems, identifying 
phenotypes of the individual subpopulations, and resolving the interplay between cell 
populations that may contribute to an integrated drug response.
Automated microscopy has thus far not been adapted for the screening of non-adherent and 
adherent leukocytes present in blood as a model to study immunology, even as traditional 
microscopy has proven crucial to understanding the complex interaction dynamics of the 
immune system 2. As other high-throughput screening technologies have been used to 
measure the impact of indirect factors on immune response propagation, such as signaling 
proteins and soluble cytokines, automated microscopy can be expected to provide the unique 
spatial resolution and throughput required to quantitatively screen the modulation of direct 
signaling by cell-cell contacts (receptor mediated signaling) that drives an immune response. 
Such information on cell-cell contacts in blood over large drug libraries is of particular 
interest as many successful drugs affect properties of cells that are not cell autonomous, but 
rather rely on the modification of the relationship between cells, best illustrated by the recent 
success of cancer immunotherapy 3.
Modulation of both the innate and adaptive immune systems is a highly successful strategy 
in the treatment of systemic diseases such as inflammatory disorders and cancer, where 
innovation of targeted biological or chemical agents are at the forefront. For instance, the 
immunomodulatory drug pomalidomide, which induces cytotoxic T-cell and NK-cell 
activity, and immune check point inhibitors such as the monoclonal antibody ipilimumab 
(anti-CTLA4) 4, alter the balance of co-stimulatory and co-inhibitory signals that manage 
self-tolerance and regulate T-cell responses 5. In both of these examples, the drug mediates 
cellular interactions that result in the death of the target cancer cell, a concept underlying

 many immunomodulatory drugs that have proven successful in treating a variety of 
malignant diseases 4.
Here, we describe a high-throughput image-based screening method, and analysis algorithm, 
which robustly quantifies the immunomodulatory potential of small molecules and other 
therapeutics, by measuring the changes in the physical interaction of leukocytes. With this 
method, phenotypic drug screening can be expanded to help realize entities that harness the 
inherent ability of effector cells, within peripheral blood, to propagate signals and function 
through direct physical contact - a major goal of immunotherapy.
Results
Systematic quantification of leukocyte cell-cell contacts
We designed a pipeline to directly assay the effects of biologicals and chemical agents for 
their immunomodulatory properties, through measuring changes in cell-cell contacts of 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) ex vivo, by population-wide single cell 
microscopy of PBMC monolayers (Supplementary Results, Supplementary Fig. 1a, and 
online methods). Individual cell types were identified using fluorescently tagged antibodies, 
in various non-overlapping combinations, against extracellular markers unique to the PBMC 
subpopulations of interest. This revealed extensive cell-cell interactions between the 
different subpopulations (see close-up in Fig. 1a). As the method requires little material per-
test, all assays are performed in the blood of an individual donor, reducing background 
inflammation due to HLA-mismatching. To assess whether the observed interactions among 
cells were functionally meaningful and to benchmark the assay, we made use of four 
biologicals that are known to decrease or increase selected cell-cell contacts: an MHC class 
II blocking antibody, two clinically used antibodies, rituximab and blinatumomab 
(Supplementary Fig. 1b), and lipopolysaccharide (LPS).
The interaction between T-cells and professional antigen presenting cells (APCs), including 
dendritic cells and macrophages, is an essential step in triggering an adaptive immune 
response. APCs present foreign antigens on MHC-II receptors to T-cells, which, upon 
recognition by the T-cell receptors (CD3; TCR), can lead to a targeted immune response 6. 
Antibodies recognizing the extracellular portion of the MHC-II receptor are known to 
efficiently obstruct this interaction (Supplementary Fig. 1b, left). When cells were 
stimulated with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), the percentage of CD11c+ cells directly 
contacting CD3+ T-cells was significantly reduced by incubation with an MHC-II blocking 
antibody prior to infection, on average from 33% to 25% (P-value < 0.028; Fig. 1b), as 
measured over a total of 124,059 cell-cell contacts. Such interaction frequencies are however 
dependent on several variables that directly influence the outcome. In this example they 
include: the fraction of all cells that are CD11c-positive (xa), the fraction of all cells that are 
CD3-positive (xb), and the total cell density or overall clustering index, which can be 
expressed as the fraction of all PBMCs that directly contact one or more PBMCs (xi). 
Indeed, all three variables showed fluctuations in the MHC control experiment, among 
others due to stimuli-dependent differences in cellular activation (Supplementary Fig. 1c) 7, 
which need to be statistically accounted for when interpreting such interaction frequencies. 
The fraction of cells that are of type A and that interact with cells of type B, if cellular

 positions and relative abundance of subpopulations were kept equal but cellular identities 
were shuffled, is given by the formula E = xa · xb · xi . Where xa is the fraction of cells of 
type A, xb is the fraction of cells of type B, and xi is the fraction of cells with one or more 
cell contacts. Bootstrap analysis confirmed the equation, consistent with the fact the three 
variables act as independent probabilities in this context (Supplementary Fig. 1d). Scoring 
alterations in the interaction frequency relative to E then gives an internally normalized 
interaction frequency, which we term the ‘interaction score’. Further information on the 
interaction score can be found in the online methods. The interaction score indicates how 
much the observed interaction frequency deviates from what would be expected by random, 
which makes it robust to alterations in the relative abundance of either subpopulation as well 
as to alterations in overall cell density or cell-cell contacts. We use arrows to indicate the 
directionality of the interaction score, i.e. relating to the fraction of A cells interacting with 
B cells, which can deviate from the opposite direction in case of strongly uneven 
subpopulation sizes or in the case of many-to-one cell-cell contacts. Corrected for these 
influences, the blocking MHC-II antibody was found to not only reduce the CD11c+→CD3+ 
T-cell interactions in VSV-stimulated condition, but also in the unstimulated state (Fig. 1c 
and Supplementary Fig. 1e), likely explained by reduced antigen ‘scanning’ by T-cells 8,9. 
As expected, both an isotype IgG control antibody and a blocking antibody against CD54, 
which functions as co-stimulatory signal and is typically not highly expressed on 
unstimulated monocytes 10, did not significantly alter the CD11c+→CD3+ T-cell interaction 
score in unstimulated condition (Supplementary Fig. 1f). Further, contact-dependent 
immune activity has been described as early as 1970, where clustering of CD14+ monocytes 
stimulated by bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) is an activation-associated signal 11. 
Accordingly, the interaction score revealed a significant increase in the interaction between 
CD14+ monocytes resulting from LPS treatment (Supplementary Fig. 1g). In these 
examples, immune activation and modulation can strongly drive cell proliferation, 
potentially effecting the number of cells within interacting subpopulations being measured. 
To additionally confirm that the interaction score is robust to either gain or loss of cellular 
subpopulations, we simulated fluctuations in the proportion of A and B cells over a wide 
range (5% to 95%), and then measured the interaction score of A↔B; synthetic data 
provides a controlled environment without compounding factors such as background 
inflammation. As expected, we found that the score is inherently robust to modifications in 
cell number (Supplementary Fig. 2a), enabling us to measure altered cell-cell contacts even 
in the context of cell proliferation and cell death.
The anti-cancer biologicals rituximab and blinatumomab induce NK-cell-to-B-cell 
(Supplementary Fig. 1b, middle) and T-cell-to-B-cell (Supplementary Fig. 1b, right) 
mediated killing, respectively, where the function of the killing depends on direct physical 
contacts between effector and target cells 12–14. Incubation with these biologicals resulted 
in not only a dose-dependent increase in respective interaction scores, but also in a 
concomitant loss of target cells (Fig. 1d-e & Supplementary Fig. 2b). In the case of 
blinatumomab, the results were independent of the marker used to identify the target B-cell 
(Fig. 1e). Even with the reduction of the target B-cell population, the interaction score is still 
increased, due to the score’s normalization to variations in subpopulation numbers (Fig 1d-
e), as described above. Thus, the recapitulation of the effects of biologicals with well-

 defined mechanisms of action, measured by population-wide imaged based screening and 
spatial analyses, validates this method for use in an immunomodulatory screening campaign.
While biologicals have great precision and efficacy in their mode of action, it would be 
advantageous to identify small chemical entities with specific immunomodulatory properties 
that could be more easily handled and manufactured. To determine what classes of drugs, if 
any, have unknown immunomodulatory effects, we surveyed a collection of 1,402 existing 
drugs (approved, investigational, and experimental, Supplementary Dataset 1) to see if one 
can benchmark effects against drugs with known immunomodulatory properties, such as 
steroids and NSAIDs.
Chemical rewiring of the leukocytic interaction network
Leukocyte interactions across the 1,402 compounds were screened in quadruplicate, 
resulting in the identification and analysis of the cell-to-cell contacts of over 80 million 
PBMCs from a single healthy donor blood donation in 7,680 wells. To induce a higher level 
of cell-cell contacts, alterations of PBMC cell-cell interactions were measured after immune 
stimulation with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), which induces an interferon (IFN)-based 
inflammatory immune response that is aimed at halting viral replication 15. Pairwise 
combinations of four major PBMC subpopulations were stained for by immunofluorescence 
after infection. At the population-level, VSV infection as measured by a single cell GFP-
reporter displayed high reproducibility (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 3a), where VSV 
preferentially infected myeloid lineage cells (Supplementary Fig. 3b), as expected 7. 80 
Compounds decreased VSV infection while 22 increased it (below -2 or above 2 standard 
deviations, with P<0.05; Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 3c). Importantly, several known 
anti-inflammatory compounds led to increased VSV infection, including corticosteroids 
(Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 3d), which may indicate a functional blockage in cellular 
signaling pathways that rely on soluble factors, and further, that these pathways are active in 
our model 16.
When analyzing all 246×106 cell-cell contacts measured in the screen, it was observed that 
the monocyte lineage cells had significantly higher numbers of direct neighbors compared to 
the lymphocyte lineage cells (Fig. 2c). Evaluating the interaction scores between the distinct 
subpopulations, the highest scores were observed among and between CD11c+ and CD14+ 
monocytes (Fig. 2d), and lower, yet higher than random, interaction scores were observed 
between all measured monocyte-lymphocyte pairs. In contrast, interaction scores of around 
zero were observed on average between B- and T-cells, and from T-cells to any of the other 
cell types, indicative of baseline cell-cell contact frequencies equal to those expected by 
random for T-cells (Fig. 2d). Overall, many more compounds altered only leukocyte cell-cell 
contacts (11.6%) than altered only virus infection (2.5%) at 2 standard deviations (Fig. 2e). 
Similarity in the molecular regulation of cell-cell receptor mediated contacts would be 
expected to lead to similarity in the drug-induced alterations of those cell-cell contacts. 
Indeed, comparing overall results revealed the highest similarity in the modulation of cell-
cell contacts among and with monocyte lineage cells (Fig. 2f).
To analyze the chemical modulation across the entire library, drug annotation enrichments 
over all interaction scores were calculated and displayed by hierarchical clustering (Fig. 2g,

 the full list of compounds and their specific immune modulation phenotype is attached as a 
resource in Supplementary Dataset 2). Inspection of the enriched drug classes altering 
PBMC cell-cell contacts revealed the presence of four groups, comprising predominant 
classes of drugs known to modulate the immune system: [1] Steroidal anti-inflammatory 
compounds such as glucocorticoids that bind to steroid hormone receptors (Fig. 2g, dark 
grey); [2] Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) including arachidonate 5-
lipoxygenase, and cyclooxygenase inhibitors (Fig. 2g, grey); [3] Drugs acting on or 
mimicking the signaling of the sympathetic nervous system, including catecholamines, 
adrenaline, dopamine, and associated receptor agonist and antagonists (Fig. 2g, light grey); 
And [4] a fourth group containing compounds described to act on other systems or 
previously unreported drug classes (Fig. 2g, yellow). Comparing the top 140 drugs with the 
strongest changed interaction scores to those 140 with strongest cytotoxicity revealed an 
overlap of only 11 drugs (7%, Supplementary Fig 3e), indicating that the cell-cell contact 
analysis did not bias towards drugs with strongly altered cell population sizes.
Steroidal anti-inflammatory compounds not only led to strong increased VSV infection, as 
expected by their mechanism of action, but also displayed significant enrichment for 
decreased CD14+ cell interactions (Fig. 2g-h). Steroidal anti-inflammatories regulate the 
immune system via the glucocorticoid receptor, reducing the transcriptional activity of pro-
inflammatory transcription factors including NF-κB and IRF317, which may explain the 
observed decreased clustering of CD14+ cells and increased VSV infection (Fig. 2g-h). 
CD14+ cell clustering was in fact the cell-cell interaction with the most significant 
correlation to VSV infection over all measured compounds (Supplementary Fig. 3f, left), 
with increased infection associated with decreased clustering and vice versa (P<2.3×10-5; 
Supplementary Fig. 3f, middle). Combined with the increased CD14+ cell clustering upon 
LPS stimulation (Supplementary Fig. 1g) and previous reports 11, this singled out CD14+ 
cell clustering as the predominant spatial readout of innate-immune activation and suggested 
some compounds reduced virus infection by activating an innate immune reaction, which 
was further confirmed in a second healthy donor (Supplementary Fig. 3f, right).
In contrast to the steroidal anti-inflammatory compounds, several NSAIDs reduced CD11c+ 
cell clustering, CD19+ B-cell clustering, and CD11c+ cell→CD3+ T-cell interactions (Fig. 
2g). NSAIDs act by inhibiting the synthesis of pro-inflammatory signaling molecules and 
chemo-attractants derived from arachidonic acid 18, including eicosanoids such as 
prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Interestingly, reduced CD11c+ cell→CD3+ T-cell 
interactions were observed for sulindic sulfoxide, salicin, celecoxib, tomelukast, and 
zafirlukast, thus reaching the same phenotype across diverse mode of NSAID action 
(P<3.8×10-5; Supplementary Fig. 3g) 18. This suggested a strong sensitivity of the CD11c+ 
cell→CD3+ T-cell interaction to modulation by NSAIDs, consistent with previous reports 
19.
Further, several drugs altered leukocyte cell-cell interactions with known mechanism of 
action not directly linked to the above described steroidal, NSAID, or nervous system related 
modes of action. Quinine compounds strongly reduced CD11c+ cell→CD3+ T-cell 
interactions (Fig. 2g-h), in line with their anti-inflammatory effect and interference in MHC 
presentation, which has led to their current clinical use in management of rheumatoid

 arthritis and other inflammatory diseases 20. Cholesterol lowering drugs also reduced 
CD11c+ cell→CD3+ T-cell interactions (Fig. 2g), possibly mediated by the well 
documented dependency of MHC-II antigen presentation on cholesterol enriched lipid rafts 
21,22. A subset of cholesterol lowering drugs, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins), 
which also reduced CD11c+ cell↔CD3+ T-cell interactions (Fig. 2g and Supplementary Fig. 
3h), have been reported to also act in a cholesterol-independent way via blocking of 
leukocyte function antigen-1 (LFA-1)-mediated adhesion to and co-stimulation of 
lymphocytes 23. ACE inhibitors, particularly enalapril and its active metabolite enalaprilat, 
lead to increased CD14+ cell clustering as well as increased CD14+ cell↔CD19+ B-cell 
interactions (Fig. 2g and Supplementary Fig. 3h), potentially related to their reported 
inhibitory effect on the expression of the monocyte chemo-attractant protein-1 24, that 
inhibits B-cell migration 25. Taxifolins and catechols included plant flavonoids with known 
antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity 26, which led to decreased CD14+ cell clustering 
(Fig. 2g-h). Further, N-acyl-L-homoserine lactones are components of the bacterial quorum 
sensing machinery, and led to increased CD3+ T-cell clustering and reduced CD19+ 
B→CD3+ T-cell interactions (Fig. 2g), which have been shown to activate the immune 
system and increase survival upon a bacterial infection model in pretreated mice 27, and a 
related compound has been shown to interfere with T-cell differentiation 28, although the 
mechanism of their recognition and effect on T-cells is as yet unresolved.
Lastly, the screen revealed several neurological modulators, which mimic or interfere with 
signaling of the nervous system, particularly the sympathetic nervous system that regulates a 
close physiological connection between the nervous and immune systems, as having 
immunomodulatory potential 29. For instance, modulators of the neurotransmitter γ-
aminobutyric acid (GABA) signaling increased CD19+ B-cell clustering (potentially 
indicating activation, Fig. 2g). GABA, expressed on most PBMC subpopulations 30, has 
been shown to have an anti-inflammatory role in mouse models of autoimmune disorders 
involving B-cells, including multiple sclerosis 31 and rheumatoid arthritis 32, suggesting B-
cell mediated effects. Further, agonists and antagonists of the β-adrenergic receptors altered 
several CD3+ T-cell centered cell-cell contacts (Fig. 2g), consistent with reported expression 
and function of the β-adrenergic receptors on lymphocytes 33. Agonists increased CD3+ T-
cell→CD11c+ cell interactions, and decreased both CD3+ T-cell clustering and CD3+ T-
cell→CD19+ B-cell interactions, while antagonists enriched for decreased CD19+ 
B→CD3+ T-cell interactions (Fig. 2g), likely related to diverse effects of β2-adrenergic 
receptor signaling on distinct subsets of T-cells reported previously 34.
Taken together, image-based screening of PBMCs enabled the exploration and 
categorization of the chemical rewiring of the leukocyte cell-cell interaction network, which 
revealed results in line with a variety of previously reported studies, all from a single 
phenotypic screen performed on the leukocytes of a single-donor blood sample. The screen 
here identified small compounds that can modulate and inhibit immune function, implicated 
novel modes of action for several compounds and existing drugs, and validated numerous 
effects through imaging.

 Crizotinib increases T-cell to APC interactions
An example of drugs with previously unknown immunomodulatory propensities are the 
inhibitors of receptor protein-tyrosine kinases (RTKi’s), which led to increased interactions 
between CD11c+ cells and CD3+ T-cells (Fig. 2g and 3a), despite RTKi’s being shown 
rarely to display immunomodulatory effects 35,36. The observed enrichment resulted from 
the strong phenotypes obtained for both enantiomers of crizotinib (Fig. 3b). (R)-crizotinib 
(from here on referred to as crizotinib) is a MET, ALK and ROS 1 kinase inhibitor 37 
approved for the treatment of ALK-rearranged non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) and 
under investigation for the treatment of several additional solid tumors.
A repeat of the leukocyte interaction screen over the entire drug library, using a blood 
donation from a second healthy donor but without background stimulation by VSV 
infection, reproduced the specific crizotinib effect: the RTKi drug class was the strongest 
enriched drug class over all cell-cell interactions (Fig. 3c), with significantly increased 
interactions between CD11c+ cells and lymphocytes (i.e. monocyte marker-negative cells) 
observed upon crizotinib treatment (Supplementary Fig. 4a). As MHC-to-TCR contact 
dependent signaling drives APC→T-cell interactions and downstream activation, we assayed 
for altered MHC expression upon crizotinib treatment of PBMCs from additional healthy 
donors by flow cytometry, and observed a dose-dependent increase of MHC-II surface levels 
on CD11c+ cells not observed for an unrelated cytotoxic compound (digitoxin) or DMSO 
(Fig. 3d). Furthermore, an MHC-II blocking antibody strongly decreased the crizotinib-
enhanced interaction between CD11c+ monocytes and CD3+ T-cells, indicating the MHC-II 
upregulation mediates the observed immunomodulatory effect (Fig. 3e). Comparison of the 
T-cell compartment after ex vivo crizotinib incubation of PBMCs indicated a crizotinib-
induced CD4+ Th1, but not Th2, response, which is indicative of an inflammatory and 
cytotoxic immune milieu (Fig. 3f and Supplementary Fig. 4b).
MHC-I and II gene expression is partially under control of overlapping transcription factors 
38, and MHC-I self-antigen presentation is a crucial factor in mounting a successful anti-
cancer immune response 3, where increased MHC expression and antigen presentation on 
cancer cells is a desirable effect in the treatment and maintenance of cancer 39. We therefore 
measured the transcriptional response using RNA sequencing in the colorectal 
adenocarcinoma-derived cell line (SW480 cells) after treatment with 2μM crizotinib (Fig. 4a 
and Supplementary Dataset 3). The genes upregulated by crizotinib treatment showed 
significant enrichment for MHC-I annotations (Fig. 4b-c), including all three major MHC-I 
cell surface receptors (HLA-A, B, and C) as well as the invariant chain β2 microglobulin 
(B2M) (Fig. 4c), and genes involved in antigen presentation and peptide processing, loading, 
and trafficking (Fig. 4c). While MHC-II expression is typically restricted to professional 
APCs, the invariant chain of MHC-II (CD74) was also significantly upregulated on SW480 
cells after crizotinib treatment (Fig. 4c). Crizotinib-enhanced expression of MHC-I on the 
SW480 cell surface was confirmed by flow cytometry (Fig. 4d-e).
Transcription factor binding site enrichment analysis on the upregulated genes revealed 
strong enrichment for binding sites of CREB and ATF (Fig. 5a), both important transcription 
factors for MHC-I and –II class genes, that further regulate and cooperate with the MHC 
class-specific transcription factors CIITA and NLRC5 38,40. Indeed, we observed increased

 phosphorylation of both CREB and ATF upon crizotinib treatment of SW480 cells (Fig. 5b, 
and Supplementary Fig. 5a), along with increased transcript levels of CIITA and NLRC5 
(Fig. 5c).
We recently identified the target spectrum of crizotinib in SW480 cells with chemical 
proteomics 41, and among the most abundant interactors in these cells was the Macrophage 
Stimulating 1 Receptor (MST1R, also known as RON), a close c-MET homolog. Crizotinib 
is described to have a dissociation constant of 25nM to MST1R 42, to inhibit MST1R with 
an IC50 of approximately 200nM 43, and KINOMEscan results have showed 100% binding 
of MST1R at 1μM (R)-crizotinib 41. MST1R is a known negative regulator of MHC-II 
expression and immune function in mice, as activation by its ligand, Macrophage 
Stimulating 1 (MST1), leads to decreased STAT1 phosphorylation and CIITA 
expression44,45. Furthermore, naive MST1R knockout mice show increased immune cell 
infiltration in lungs46, thus we speculated that crizotinib could increase MHC expression by 
inhibition of MST1R/RON.
Using inducible shRNA targeting MST1R in SW480 cells, the loss-of-function coincided 
with increased MHC-I surface expression over independent short hairpins after 72h of 
efficient MST1R knockdown (Fig. 5d-e and Supplementary Fig. 5b-d), while no such 
increase was observed for the negative control shRNA (Fig. 5e). Furthermore, treatment of 
SW480 cells with a more potent and specific MST1R-inhibitor, BMS-777607 47, also led to 
strong upregulation of CIITA, NLRC5 and HLA-B (Fig. 5f), while, as expected, the ligand 
MST1 did not induce expression of these genes (Supplementary Fig. 5e). Increased MHC-I 
surface expression upon BMS-777607 was confirmed by flow cytometry (Supplementary 
Fig. 5f), while incubation with MST1 showed no change in MHC-I surface levels by flow 
cytometry (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Fig. 5f). Importantly, combined incubation of SW480 
cells with MST1 and crizotinib led to reduced MHC-I surface levels compared to crizotinib 
treatment alone (Fig. 4d), and further competition experiments using crizotinib and MST1 in 
healthy donor blood revealed a full reversal of the crizotinib-increased interactions between 
CD3+ T-cells and CD11c+ monocytes (Fig. 5g).
To test if crizotinib induced MHC-I expression also in vivo, we injected crizotinib or vehicle 
alone into SCID deficient mice with a SW480 xenografted tumor. Comparison of the tumors 
by immunohistology indicated significantly higher levels of MHC-I expression in the 
crizotinib treated mice compared to vehicle control (Fig. 6a-b), recapitulating the ex vivo 
immunomodulatory effect of crizotinib in vivo.
The immunomodulatory effect of crizotinib was not limited to healthy blood or the SW480 
colon-carcinoma cell line: analysis of publicly available transcriptomics data of an ALK-
positive NSCLC-derived cell line made resistant to crizotinib by prolonged incremental 
exposure to the drug (up to 1μM), compared to its parental H3122 cell line 48, also revealed 
increased expression of MHC-I and II genes (Supplementary Fig. 6a-c). We confirmed this 
by qPCR, measuring strong upregulation of transcript abundance of CIITA, NLRC5 and 
HLA-A upon crizotinib treatment of the parental H3122 cells (Supplementary Fig. 6d). 
Further, we performed chemical proteomics with the racemic mixture of crizotinib in H3122 
cells, which revealed extensive binding of MST1R also in this setting (Supplementary Table 
Vladimer et al.

 1). Thus, crizotinib interacted with MST1R and led to an increased expression of MHC 
genes also in this model cell line for NSCLC, for which crizotinib is clinically approved. 
Intriguingly, MST1R may be a relevant crizotinib target in NSCLC, as a meta-analysis of 15 
studies measuring gene expression in lung cancers showed consistent and significant 
upregulation of MST1R specific to NSCLC (Supplementary Fig. 6e).
The presentation of self-antigens on MHC-I by cancer cells is a key step in the anti-cancer 
immune response of the host, and is essential for several checkpoint inhibitor treatments 
currently under investigation 39. To test the immunomodulatory potential of crizotinib in 
primary patient-derived material, PBMCs of a patient diagnosed with chronic 
myelomonocytic leukemia, with over 70% CD33+ and CD34+ blast cells in peripheral blood, 
were incubated ex vivo with crizotinib. Crizotinib-treated peripheral blasts showed a 
doubling in MHC-I surface expression levels as measured by flow cytometry (Fig. 6c), as 
well a concentration-dependent increase in T-cell↔blast interactions as measured by 
automated microscopy (Fig. 6d). The anti-cancer effects of genetic ablation and chemical 
inhibition of MST1R have been shown in vivo in mouse models for lung cancer, revealing 
increased CD8+ T-cell tumor infiltration resulting in reduced metastasis 45. Combined, our 
data suggest that the crizotinib-mediated MST1R inhibition and subsequent increase in 
MHC-I surface levels on colon, lung, and blood cancer cells, may aid an anticancer immune 
response and be beneficial for clinical use in combination with immunotherapy in a range of 
malignancies (Supplementary Fig. 6f) 8. A clinical trial combining crizotinib with CTLA-4-
blockade by ipilimumab for the treatment of NSCLC may reveal if clinical anti-cancer 
immune responses benefit from the here discovered immunomodulatory effect of crizotinib 
(NCT01998126 clinicaltrials.gov).
Discussion
The work presented here defines the possibility to systematically quantify and identify the 
immunomodulatory potential of drugs and biologicals over the complex multi-lineage 
populations in PBMCs of one individual. Prior to this, the technical options and models for 
measuring system-wide immunomodulatory events at high-throughput were limited, driving 
the need for such a screening tool. The dataset provides evidence of immunomodulatory 
potential for some 150 chemical agents, many of which have not been reported to display 
effects on the immune system and my thus become object of further investigation. As for 
crizotinib, it is conceivable that the immunomodulatory potential of some of these agents 
unknowingly contributes to the clinical success of individual drugs. While the library here 
was screened at single concentrations, it is feasible that additional effects may become 
apparent at higher, but still safe, concentrations. This large-scale functional characterization 
of the current collection of “common” drugs represents a new dimension and a potential 
future standard assay in the characterization of existing and new drugs. It remains to be seen, 
how often the effects reported here result in altered cell-cell interactions, cell infiltrations 
and altered immune functions in other tissues. Certainly, the platform can easily be adapted 
to screen for new agents aiming at specific immunomodulatory effects. Equally exciting is 
the perspective to perform “personalized” assessments on individual patients or healthy 
donors on a routine basis. The systematic perturbation of the immune system of an 
individual over such a varied array of pathways and processes may thus provide a unique

 functional “profile” of the health status of a person, likely to depend on age, gender, diet and 
transient and chronic infections. We illustrate how the approach may be useful to identify 
agents that act immunomodulatory in cancer, but other diseases characterized by increased 
inflammation, such as rheumatoid arthritis or autoimmune diseases, may be particularly 
interesting to consider in further studies. The finding that crizotinib, a drug in clinical use, 
may exerts some of its anti-tumor activity through an immunomodulatory effect may help 
sharpen its ideal therapeutic window. In general, modulating the immune system by small 
compounds may be a desirable integrated positive effect that is more common than 
previously expected, and a result of their full polypharmacological properties 49,50.
Online Methods
Collection and purification of peripheral blood and bone marrow cells
Peripheral blood was obtained from healthy donors, from patients with CMML who were 
treated at the Medical University of Vienna/General Hospital Vienna, and blood from the 
Austrian Red Cross. Austrian Red Cross donations were enriched buffy coats. Blood 
coagulation was prevented with EDTA or heparin. The Ethics Commission at the Medical 
University of Vienna/General Hospital Vienna approved the collection of samples from 
healthy donors and patients. All donors and patients provided written informed consent after 
nature and consequences of the study were explained. All donors were blind to end users. 
Peripheral blood was diluted 1:1-1:3 in PBS and mononuclear cells were isolated with 
lymphoprep density gradient from Axis-Shield following manufacturer directions. Purified 
cells were suspended in RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS and penicillin-streptomycin. 
For all experiments involving primary cells, cells were cultured in RPMI supplemented with 
10% FBS and penicillin-streptomycin.
Non-adherent PBMC monolayer formation, small-molecule screening, viruses, reagents, 
cell lines
50nl of selected screening compounds in DMSO, and DMSO controls, were transferred to 
Corning 384-well, tissue-culture treated clear bottom plates by a Labcyte Echo liquid 
handler attached to a Perkin Elmer high-content cell::explorer workstation. Screening 
compound libraries were obtained from the NIH Molecular Libraries Program, gifts from 
various groups (see acknowledgements), or designed in-house. Selected compounds were 
routinely quality controlled by mass spectrometry. Compounds screened are outlined in 
Supplementary Dataset 1. 50μl of culture media containing approximately 40x104 cell / ml 
is pipetted into each well of a 384-well plate, and incubated at 37°C with 5% CO2, allowing 
cells to settle to the bottom; the erythrocyte concentration within the sample after 
purification should be limited to allow PBMCs space on the well bottom. For virus screens, 
cells were incubated with compound for 3 hours before VSV-GFP was added in 10μl at 
MOI=10 for 18 hours. Screen in Figure 2 was performed in quadruplicate (global level) and 
duplicate (population level) over 384-well plates from a single healthy donor; See figure 
legend for technical replicate information for other experiments. For the healthy donor naive 
spatial screen, PBMCs were incubated with compound for 36 hours. For blocking-antibody 
experiments anti-human HLA-DR (G46-6) (eBiosciences), anti-human CD54 (HA58) 
(BDbiosciences) or mouse-IgG2a isotype control (C1.18.4) (BioXCell) were incubated for 3

 hours prior to overnight stimulation with VSV or 10ng/ml LPS (Invivogen). HLA-DR 
blocking antibody was incubated overnight prior to treatment with crizotinib for 3 hours. 
Rituximab (anti-human CD20, Absolute antibody), or Blinatumomab (Amgen, Vienna 
General Hospital in-patient Pharmacy) were incubated at indicated concentrations in healthy 
donor blood overnight or 48 hours, respectively. Recombinant MST1 from RnD Systems. 
All screens were stopped by fixing and permeabilizing the cells with 10μl of a solution of 
4% formaldehyde and 0.01% triton-X114 in PBS for 10 minutes at room temperature. 
Fixative containing medium was removed and 30 μl of an experiment-dependent antibody 
cocktail in PBS was added to the cells one hour at room temperature, all antibodies at 1:300 
dilution. Antibodies were selected for their ability to identify specific populations of interest: 
Anti-human CD19 (HIB19, APC, B-cells), CD11c (3.9, APC, majority DCs and 
monocytes), CD3 (HIT3a, PE, T-cells), CD14 (61D3, PE, macrophages and monocytes), and 
CD34 (4H11, APC, hematopoietic progenitors) from eBiosciences, CD20 (2H7, GFP, B-
cells) from BD Biosciences, and CD56 (A07788, PE, NK-cell) from Beckman Coulter, were 
all used in various combinations to identify populations of interests in each experiment, as 
described in the text. DAPI (Sigma) was used for nuclear detection at 10 𝜇M. SW480 and 
H3122 cells were cultured in DMEM or RPMI respectively, supplemented with 10% FBS 
and penicillin-streptomycin. H3122 cells were a kind gift from Eric Haura, and SW480 from 
Walter Berger. Cells used in experiments regularly undergo ELISA and PCR tests for 
mycoplasma.
Flow cytometry
PBMCs or SW480 cells were kept naive or incubated with small molecules compounds for 
indicated time points. Antibodies used for flow cytometry are listed above as used for 
imaging, as well as anti-Human HLA-DQ (SK10, FITC, MHC-II major population), HLA-
ABC (G46-2.6, Pe-Cy5, MHC-I major population), CD4 (SK3, PE, T-cell subset), 
CD183(CXCR3-173, FITC, T-cell subset), and CD194(CCR4-D8SEE, APC, T-cell subset) 
from eBiosciences. Samples were run on BD LSRFortessa with Diva software and analyzed 
with FlowJo.
Western Blots
SW480 cells were plated overnight and stimulated at the indicated time points. Pellets were 
lysed using IP lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1% 
Nonidet P-40, 50 mM NaF, 1 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM PMSF, 5 g/ml TPCK) and protease 
inhibitor mixture for 10 min on ice before high-speed clearance, and quantified with 
Bradford. Proteins were detected with rabbit anti-Phospho-CREB (Ser113)(87G3), mouse 
anti-CREB (86B10), or rabbit anti-RON (C81H9) (Cell Signaling) and mouse anti-tubulin 
(Abcam), and detected using a goat anti-mouse or -rabbit (H+L) HRP conjugated secondary 
antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories), and exposed on film.
RNA isolation and qPCR
RNA was purified from SW480 or H3122 cells using and RNeasy Kit (Qiagen) and was 
reverse transcribed using oligo dT primers and RevertAid Reverse Transcriptase 
(Fermentas). qPCR was performed using SensiMix SYBR Green (Bioline) analyzed on a 
Rotor-Gene Q from Qiagen. Genes CIITA (F: GGCTGGAATTTGGCAGCAC, R:

R: TCCGCAGATACCTGGAGAAC) were normalized to the housekeeping gene GAPDH 
(F: GAAGGTGAAGGTCGGAGT, R: GAAGATGGTGATGGGATTTC).
MST1R inducible knockdown
97-mer shRNA sequences were obtained as ultramer oligonucleotides (IDT), PCR amplified 
and cloned into the inducible retroviral miR-E shRNA vector pRT3GEN (pSIN-TRE3G-
turboGFP-miR-E-PGK-NeoR) as described previously using standard cloning techniques 
51. The Tet-on competent SW480 cells were generated by virally transducing vector 
pMSCV-RIEP (pMSCV-rtTA3-IRES-EcoR-PGK-PuroR) and standard retroviral packaging. 
After virus infection, transformed cells were selected using 5μg/mL puromycin (Sigma-
Aldrich), and SW480 RIEP cells were transduced in a similar way using the retroviral 
shRNA vector pRT3GEN. The following 97mer target sequences were used: Renilla at 
position 713,

transduction and selection using 2mg/mL G418 (Roth), shRNA expression was induced by 
addition of 2μg/mL doxycycline to the culture media. MHC-I expression was analyzed by 
flow cytometry after 72 hours of doxycycline addition. pRT3GEN-shRen.713 targeting 
Renilla Luciferase coding sequence served as negative control shRNA. MFI of MHC-I (PE-
Cy5 channel) was normalized to uninduced levels. Knockdown efficiency was determined 
by western blot as described above.
RNA Sequencing
SW480 cells were seeded in 6-well plates 24h before (R)-crizotinib was added to a final 
concentration of 2μM. After incubation for 72h, medium was aspirated and cells washed 
with PBS. Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) and RNA amount was 
measured using Qubit 2.0 Fluorometric Quantitation system (Life Technologies), both 
following manufacturer protocols. RNA integrity number (RIN) was determined using 
Experion Automated Electrophoresis System (Bio-Rad). RNA-seq libraries were prepared 
with TruSeq Stranded mRNA LT sample preparation kit (Illumina) using Sciclone and 
Zephyr liquid handling robotics (PerkinElmer). Library amount was quantified using Qubit 
2.0 Fluorometric Quantitation system (Life Technologies) and the size distribution was 
assessed using Experion Automated Electrophoresis System (Bio-Rad). Sequencing libraries 
were pooled, diluted and sequenced on Illumina HiSeq 2000 using 50 bp single-read

 chemistry. Base calls provided by the Illumina Realtime Analysis software were converted 
into BAM format using Illumina2bam and demultiplexed using BamIndexDecoder (https://
github.com/wtsi-npg/illumina2bam). Transcriptome analysis was performed using the 
Tuxedo suite. TopHat2 (v2.0.10, http://genomebiology.com/2013/14/4/R36/abstract) was 
supplied with reads passing vendor quality filtering (PF reads) and the Ensembl transcript 
set (Homo sapiens, e73, September 2013) as reference. TopHat2 analyses were run 
independently for each replicate. Cufflinks (v2.1.1, http://www.nature.com/nbt/
journal/v31/n1/full/nbt.2450.html) was used to assemble transcripts from spliced read 
alignments, using the Ensembl e73 transcriptome as the reference as well as de novo 
assembly of transcript models. Differential expression was assessed with Cuffdiff v2.1.1 
(http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v28/n5/full/nbt.1621.html). Transcriptome sets of all 
replicates for each sample group were combined with Cuffmerge. Finally, cummeRbund 
(http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/cummeRbund.html) and biomaRt 
(http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/biomaRt.html) were used in 
combination with custom R scripts to perform quality assessment and further refine analysis 
results. All sequencing was performed by the Biomedical Sequencing Facility at CeMM 
(http://medical-epigenomics.org). SW480 RNA sequencing results are available in 
Supplementary Dataset 3. Transcription data from ALK-positive H3122 cells resistant to 
crizotinib treatment was obtained from NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) accession 
number GSE49508.
Drug affinity chromatography and protein mass spectrometry
The crizotinib affinity probe was prepared in two steps from commercially available 3-
[(1RS)-1-(2,6-dichloro-3-fluorophenyl)ethoxy]-5-[1-(piperidin-4-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-
yl]pyridin-2-amine (Selleckchem) according to literature and drug-affinity matrices were 
prepared as described previously (Huber et al., 2014). Briefly, affinity chromatography and 
elution were performed in duplicate using 25nmol of compound immobilized on 50μL NHS-
activated Sepharose 4 Fast Flow beads (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences) and 10mg total cell 
lysate as protein input per replicate. For competition experiments, cell lysates were 
pretreated with 20μM 3-[(1RS)-1-(2,6-dichloro-3-fluorophenyl)ethoxy]-5-[1-(piperidin-4-
yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]pyridin-2-amine for 30 minutes. Eluates were labeled with iTRAQ and 
quantitative protein mass spectrometry and bioinformatics analysis utilizing the R isobar 
package were performed as previously reported 48,52.
Xenograft mouse model and immunohistochemistry
All animals were acclimatized for one week, and had free access to water and food during 
the experiment. Animals were under a 12-hour light cycle, and temperature, humidity and 
housing per laboratory animal guidelines and regulations. The group size was based on 
previous experience on variability of tumor growth within control groups. Animals were 
grouped based on body weight, exclusion/inclusion criteria were pre- established in the 
ethical permit, and outliers in body weight were excluded; although none for this study; 
groups were not randomized. SCID mice (female, 5-6 weeks, Scanbur, n = 3/group) were 
injected s.c. with 1×106 SW480 cells together with a matrix gel (1:1) in the sacral area. 
Treatment was initiated one day after cell inoculation. Vehicle or (S)- or (R)-crizotinib was 
administered subcutaneously once daily at 25mg/kg for 35 days. (S)- or (R)-crizotinib was

 diluted in 1% DMSO, 10% ethanol, 10% cremaphore, 10% Tween 80, 69% PBS. Animals 
were sacrificed 2 hours after last administration of drugs on day 26. Tumors were quickly 
dissected, snap-frozen, and kept at -80°C until further analysis. Tumor sections were fixed in 
acetone for 10 min, and rinsed in TBS. The sections were blocked in 3% BSA in TBS. 
MHC-I antibody (MHC class I clone W6/32, Biolegend) was diluted in BSA in TBS and 
incubated overnight at 4°C in humid atmosphere. After incubation, the slides were rinsed in 
TBS with 0.025% Triton-X. AlexaFlour555-conjugated secondary antibody (Invitrogen) was 
diluted 1:500 in BSA, and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. The slides were 
counter stained with DAPI, and mounted with prolong gold. Images were taken on an 
LSM780 confocal (Zeiss) with equal laser line power settings over all samples. 8 random 
images were taken from 3 tumors per group; image analysis was performed blind to the 
experimenter. All experiments involving animals followed protocols approved by 
Stockholms Norra djurförsöksetiska nämnd (laboratory animal ethical committee 
Stockholm) and were in compliance with 2010/63/EU directive.
Image and computational analysis
Imaging—Each well of a 348-well plate was imaged at 10x with 2x2 non-overlapping 
images, so that within the 2x2 square was approximately 95% of the well surface. The 
images were taken sequentially from DAPI, GFP, PE, and APC channels, with lasers and 
bandpass filter sets set so the channels were non-overlapping; a PerkinElmer Operetta or 
Opera Phenix automated spinning disk confocal microscope were used. Fluorophores were 
tested for channel separation on each machine. The raw .tiff images were exported from the 
microscope for analysis, below and stored for subsequent data mining.
Illumination correction—Illumination correction was performed based on a novel 
algorithm that depends on the observation that PBMCs in the monolayer never fully cover 
the entire well, but always leave adequate space in between individual cells or clusters of 
cells to estimate regional background intensities. As we imaged each well entirely (including 
regions of wells outside of images), we first detect regions of each image that contains areas 
outside of the well, based on full-well image reconstruction and plate-wide analysis of 
where outside well areas are most likely. For each individual single-channel image a 2D 
polynomial with two degrees of freedom in each dimension was fit on log10-transformed(1 
+ intensity) values, excluding regions of images containing areas outside the well, excluding 
the brightest 30% of the signal (working under the assumption that bright signal is not 
background signal, which does not hold for brightfield images), and weighted to a 
combination of the inverse signal intensity (to weigh dark regions heavier) and a smooth 
function that weights edges of images heavier, as those are relatively underrepresented 
compared to the typically brighter center of the image. As the illumination correction 
function for each individual image is described in the efficient form of a polynomial 
function, goodness of fit statistics and background patterns and intensities could be 
compared across each image from the same channel from the entire plate, for outlier 
detection (3 x interquartile range (IQR) from median statistics). For outliers, fits are retried 
with different parameters (excluding larger regions of potential outside-well area), or if that 
fails, corrected with plate-average background correction functions for images of the same 
channel and at the same site within the other wells. Remaining outlier wells are flagged as 
Vladimer et al.

 potential technical problems. The algorithm has been optimized for robustness over 
hundreds of imaged 384-well plates containing PBMCs, and improvements in separation of 
negatively-, singly, and doubly-stained cells have been confirmed.
Background correction—Image-based small compound screens suffer from the fact that 
small compounds themselves can be sources of fluorescence signal, overlapping in 
unpredictable ways with the wavelengths of the imaged channels. To correct for small 
(within 3xIQR from median) background intensity variations, also stemming from other 
sources such as light source fluctuations, we further corrected for global background 
differences within all images of the same channel and of each well, and across all wells of 
the same plate. Outlier background values per well are flagged as potentially auto-
fluorescent compound containing or otherwise problematic wells, and discarded from final 
screen statistics. Finally, illumination- and background-corrected images are reconstructed 
and stored independently for further image analysis. Improvements at the level of image 
quality and image analysis results were confirmed, and robustness of the algorithm was 
improved over hundreds of plates.
Image quality evaluation—All (illumination- and background-corrected) images of each 
plate were automatically rescaled and merged per well and per plate, allowing for quick 
visual evaluation of the quality over the entire dataset of a single plate.
Single cell image analysis using CellProfiler (code availability)—Single cell 
image analysis was performed using CellProfiler v2, based on DAPI-stain derived nucleus 
(‘Nuclei’) detection, expansion from nucleus for cell outline detection (‘Cells’), and a 
second and third set of expansions from Cells, to identify a ring outside of each cell for a 
local background (‘LocalBackground’) area sampling. Standard CellProfiler intensity, 
texture and shape features were measured from Nuclei, Cells and the LocalBackground over 
all channels where applicable. Differences between Nuclear and Cell log-transformed 
intensities over LocalBackground were used for the plate-wide identification of marker-
positive cells, and different stains were thresholded in a supervised manner for the large-
scale drug screens. Unsupervised thresholding was performed based on the predominant 
marker-negative cell population over the entire plate. Thresholds were regularly visually 
controlled, at the plate-wide population distribution level, as well as at the single cell level, 
relating images and image analysis results.
SVM-based machine learning for quality control—Iterative SVM-based machine 
learning was applied at the level of individual cells to identify poorly segmented cells, cells 
covered by contaminants or artifacts (‘blobs’), or false-positively identified cells, as 
described in 4,53.
Plate-effect correction—Plate-effect correction was performed using a weighted 2D 
polynomial fit, excluding positive control wells and 5% of the strongest outlier wells, and 
weighted based on a function that weights outside wells stronger than inside wells and 
outlier wells weaker compared to wells closer to the plate median. Globally, improvements 
in reproducibility across replicate wells coming from plates with individually randomized 
Vladimer et al.

 plate layouts, as well as in the separation of positive and negative control wells were 
confirmed.
Significance calculation & hit selection for large-scale screens—For the large-
scale screens, datasets were plate effect normalized, normalized to the median of the 
DMSO-controls of each plate, and significance of the hits was calculated based on a 
Student’s t-test of mean equals 0, over all replicated wells (n=4 for the virus screens). Final 
infection and viability scores are calculated as the average over all replicates. Hits were 
selected based on p-value < 0.01 and based on an absolute average z-score of at least 2. All 
other significance scores in figures were calculated using a two-tailed t-test, unless otherwise 
noted.
Compound annotation enrichment analysis—Compounds were annotated based on 
their annotations as stored in the database and ontology of Chemical Entities of Biological 
Interest (CHEBI) from the European Bioinformatics Institute (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/) 
as well as from the KEGG Compound database (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/compound/). 
Overall, this retrieved 136 unique annotations for our library. Enrichment scores were 
calculated as two-tailed t-test’s between the phenotypes of compounds with a given 
annotation compared to the phenotypes of compounds without that given annotation.
Cell-cell interaction analysis—Pairwise distances (measured in pixels) between all cells 
in a well were calculated over a reconstruction of nuclear positions over the different images 
per well. Cells were considered pairwise if the pairwise distance between nuclear centroids 
was equal to or less than 15 pixels. The observed fraction of A→B interacting cells equals 
the fraction of (all A-type cells interacting with one or more B-type cell). This fraction was 
log2-transformed against the (EAB) value calculated for that well, i.e. (the fraction of A-type 
cells of all cells) * (the fraction of B-type cells of all cells) * (the fraction of all cells that 
have at least one or more contacts within 15 pixels). Results were confirmed to be 
insensitive to reasonable increments of the ‘15 pixel’ threshold. Although the reference 
value (EAB) is independent of the direction of interaction, A→B and B→A can diverge as a 
consequence of the interaction conformation of the two subpopulations. So called ‘rosettas’ 
existing for instance of an A-cell binding to many B-cells can induce strongly divergent 
results between A→B and B→A. Readouts were corrected for plate effects as described 
above, and analyzed further by various means including drug class enrichment analyses and 
hit selection strategies as also described above.
