IMPORTANCE Bedside monitor alarms alert nurses to life-threatening physiologic changes
among patients, but the response times of nurses are slow.
OBJECTIVE To identify factors associated with physiologic monitor alarm response time.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This prospective cohort study used 551 hours of
video-recorded care administered by 38 nurses to 100 children in a children’s hospital
medical unit between July 22, 2014, and November 11, 2015.
EXPOSURES Patient, nurse, and alarm-level factors hypothesized to predict response time.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES We used multivariable accelerated failure-time models
stratified by each nurse and adjusted for clustering within patients to evaluate associations
between exposures and response time to alarms that occurred while the nurse was outside
the room.
RESULTS The study participants included 38 nurses, 100% (n = 38) of whom were white and
92% (n = 35) of whom were female, and 100 children, 51% (n = 51) of whom were male. The
race/ethnicity of the child participants was 45% (n = 45) black or African American, 33%
(n = 33) white, 4% (n = 4) Asian, and 18% (n = 18) other. Of 11 745 alarms among 100
children, 50 (0.5%) were actionable. The adjusted median response time among nurses was
10.4 minutes (95% CI, 5.0-15.8) and varied based on the following variables: if the patient was
on complex care service (5.3 minutes [95% CI, 1.4-9.3] vs 11.1 minutes [95% CI, 5.6-16.6]
among general pediatrics patients), whether family members were absent from the patient’s
bedside (6.3 minutes [95% CI, 2.2-10.4] vs 11.7 minutes [95% CI, 5.9-17.4] when family
present), whether a nurse had less than 1 year of experience (4.4 minutes [95% CI, 3.4-5.5] vs
8.8 minutes [95% CI, 7.2-10.5] for nurses with 1 or more years of experience), if there was a
1 to 1 nursing assignment (3.5 minutes [95% CI, 1.3-5.7] vs 10.6 minutes [95% CI, 5.3-16.0] for
nurses caring for 2 or more patients), if there were prior alarms requiring intervention (5.5
minutes [95% CI, 1.5-9.5] vs 10.7 minutes [5.2-16.2] for patients without intervention), and if
there was a lethal arrhythmia alarm (1.2 minutes [95% CI, −0.6 to 2.9] vs 10.4 minutes [95%
CI, 5.1-15.8] for alarms for other conditions). Each hour that elapsed during a nurse’s shift was
associated with a 15% longer response time (6.1 minutes [95% CI, 2.8-9.3] in hour 2 vs 14.1
minutes [95% CI, 6.4-21.7] in hour 8). The number of nonactionable alarms to which the
nurse was exposed in the preceding 120 minutes was not associated with response time.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Response time was associated with factors that likely
represent the heuristics nurses use to assess whether an alarm represents a life-threatening
condition. The nurse to patient ratio and physical and mental fatigue (measured by the
number of hours into a shift) represent modifiable factors associated with response time.
Chronic alarm fatigue resulting from long-term exposure to nonactionable alarms may be a
more important determinant of response time than short-term exposure.

 P
hysiologic monitors are intended to help clinicians de-
tect clinical emergencies by alarming when vital signs
exceed preset thresholds or when cardiac arrhythmias
occur. For alarms to be effective, they should activate only for
serious physiologic changes and be considered important by
staffmembers.1Unfortunately,mostcurrentphysiologicmoni-
tors generate high rates of alarms that are rarely actionable.2,3
In 6 studies of pediatric wards and intensive care settings,
monitor alarm rates ranged from 1.5 to 24 alarms per moni-
tored patient-hour.4-9 In pediatric intensive care settings, 5
studies found that 3% to 13% of physiologic monitor alarms
warrantedaction,4-8and1studyperformedonapediatricward
found that only 1% warranted action.4 Perhaps as a result, the
response times of nurses to alarms were slow.4 A delayed re-
sponse to a patient whose alarm represents impending car-
diac arrest could be catastrophic.10
National surveys of health care staff members performed
in 2005 and 2011 ranked “frequent false alarms, which lead
to reduced attention or response to alarms when they occur”
as the most important alarm issue to address.11,12 More than
75% of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that nuisance
alarms reduce trust in alarms and cause caregivers to inap-
propriately turn alarms off.11,12 As a result, nurses likely de-
velop the expectation that most physiologic monitor alarms
are not important and prioritize other routine care tasks above
responding to alarms when they are busy unless there are spe-
cific concerning features of the patient or the alarm.
Video recording provides an opportunity to thoroughly
evaluateandimprovethequalityofcaredeliveredinhospitals.13
In a previous pilot study using video, we identified an associa-
tion between increased nonactionable physiologic monitor
alarm exposure (a proxy for acute alarm fatigue) and delayed
nurse response time.4 In this study, we examined a broader set
of exposure variables and evaluated the associations of pa-
tient-, nurse-, and alarm-level factors with the response time
of nurses to physiologic monitor alarms.
Methods
Study definitions are provided in the Box. We conducted this
prospective cohort study on 1 inpatient unit admitting pa-
tients to the general pediatrics and medically complex ser-
vices at The Children’
s Hospital of Philadelphia between July
22, 2014, and November 11, 2015. The medically complex ser-
vice admits patients with a wide range of comorbidities and
technology dependence. Examples include patients with in-
testinal failure, complications of extreme prematurity, ge-
netic syndromes, and other diagnoses that result in a popula-
tion that is medically fragile and often requires intensive care
during hospital admissions. Patients on this unit undergoing
continuous cardiorespiratory and/or pulse oximetry monitor-
ing were eligible. To gain the analytic benefits of contrasting
theeffectsofdifferentexposureswithinindividualnursesover
time,14,15 we invited the nurses of eligible patients to partici-
pate in multiple sessions.
This study was approved by the institutional review board
of The Children’
s Hospital of Philadelphia. We obtained writ-
ten in-person consent from each patient’
s parent and nurse.
We obtained a Certificate of Confidentiality from the Na-
tional Institutes of Health to reassure and protect hospital em-
ployees if the research video was subpoenaed.16 We could then
use the Certificate to legally refuse to disclose any video re-
cordings or associated data.
Monitoring Equipment and Secondary Notification
All bed spaces included General Electric Dash 3000 (General
Electric) monitors that were used if ordered by the physician.
Physicians specified alarm parameters using an electronic
Box. Study Definitions
Out-of-room alarm: An alarm that (1) occurs while no clinicians are
in the patient’s room or are viewing the central monitoring station,
and (2) sends an automatic text message to the bedside nurse
(alarms for asystole, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation,
apnea, heart rate [HR], respiratory rate [RR], oxygen saturation
[SpO2], SpO2 probe off, and leads fail). The text message includes
the following elements: General Electric alarm level (crisis,
warning, advisory, or system), alarm type and value that triggered
the alarm (such as HR HI 190), and the date and time.
Clinical alarm: An alarm for a cardiac arrhythmia or a physiologic
parameter that is outside of the range set for the patient on the
bedside monitor.
Valid alarm: A clinical alarm that correctly identifies the
physiologic status of the patient. Validity was based on waveform
quality, signal strength indicators, and artifact conditions,
referencing the monitor’s operator’s manual.
Actionable alarm: A valid clinical alarm that either (1) leads to an
observed clinical intervention (such as initiating supplemental
oxygen) or (2) leads to an observed consultation with another
clinician (such as discussing the patient’s tachycardia with a
resident) at the bedside or (3) warrants intervention or
consultation for a clinical condition (such as a prolonged
desaturation) but the condition was unwitnessed: occurring while
no clinicians are present and resolving before any clinicians
entered the room or visualized the central monitoring station.
Nonactionable alarm: An alarm that does not meet the actionable
definition above, including invalid alarms such as those caused by
motion artifact, alarms that are valid but nonactionable, and
technical alarms.
Technical alarm: An alarm for a problem with the physiologic
monitor device or associated sensors.
Key Points
Question What factors are associated with response time to
hospital physiologic monitor alarms?
Findings In this cohort study, alarms for patients on a complex
care service or without family members present received faster
responses. Nurses who responded faster included those who were
earlier in their shifts, had less than 1 year of experience, previously
responded to an alarm requiring intervention, were caring for only
1 patient, and were responding to an alarm for lethal arrhythmia.
Meaning Response time was associated with factors that likely
contribute to heuristics that nurses use to assess the probability
that a patient’s condition is life threatening.

ration by pulse oximeter, pulse oximeter probe off, and leads
fail also automatically sent text messages to the bedside nurse
(Table 1).

 previously,4,18andtheacceptability,feasibility,andcostsofper-
forming this study have been reported.19 We temporarily
mounted up to 6 small video cameras in the rooms of pa-
tients and 1 camera on the central monitoring station and re-
corded for approximately 6 hours per session. The camera on
the central monitoring station captured any responses that oc-
curred when nurses visualized monitors remotely.
Video Review
We trained a research assistant to review the video record-
ings and determine the validity and actionability of clinical
alarms. During the training period, the research assistant re-
viewed 4675 clinical alarms (every clinical alarm that re-
quired interpretation from the first 42 patients) with over-
sight from an expert in physiologic monitoring (Bonafide).
We then determined if the research assistant could accu-
ratelyreviewalarmsindependently.Theresearchassistantand
expert separately reviewed every clinical alarm that required
interpretationfrom10additionalpatients(n = 883alarms).The
research assistant and expert agreed on the validity determi-
nation for 99.3% of the 883 alarms. Using the expert as the gold
standard, the research assistant’
s sensitivity (she assessed an
alarm as valid when the physician also did) was 99.4% (95%
CI, 97.9%-99.9%) and her specificity (she assessed an alarm
as invalid when the physician also did) was 99.3% (95% CI,
98.1%-99.8%). The research assistant and expert agreed on the
actionability determination for 99.7% of the 883 alarms. The
research assistant’
s sensitivity was 100% (1-sided 97.5% CI,
39.8%-100%) and her specificity was 99.7% (95% CI 99.0%-
99.9%). Based on these results, for the remaining 48 patients
the expert performed a secondary review of only the clinical
alarms that the research assistant determined to be valid.
Response Time Outcome
Our analysis examined response time, measured as the num-
ber of seconds elapsing between the start time of each audible
alarmonthebedsidemonitorandthetimeaclinicalstaffmem-
ber either entered the patient’
s room or viewed the central
monitoringstation.Sinceallpatientsontheunithadtheirwave-
forms displayed on the central monitoring station, we conser-
vatively assumed that any viewing of the central monitoring
station included viewing the vital signs of the patient under
study and counted as a response. Responses by other clinical
staff members were censored at the time of their response.
We limited our analyses of response time to “out-of-
room” alarms that (1) occurred while no clinicians were in the
patient’
s room or were viewing the central monitoring sta-
tion, and (2) sent an automatic text message to the bedside
nurse (Box). We focused on these alarms because we wanted
to identify the factors influencing the decision nurses must
make when they receive an alarm notification, whether that
is to interrupt their current patient care task and respond im-
mediately or whether to delay responding until their current
task is complete.
Exposures of Interest
In planning the exposure variables to measure and include in
theanalysis,wedevelopedatheoreticalframeworklinkingcon-
structs such as a “nurse’
s concern that patient is at increased
risk of a life-threatening event” with specific variables and re-
sponse time (eFigure in the Supplement). Since our previous
pilot study identified an association between the number of
nonactionable alarms to which a nurse was exposed for the
same patient in the preceding 120 minutes and response time,
we also evaluated nonactionable alarm exposure groups as ex-
posure variables.4 We divided the nonactionable alarm counts
intoquartilesofincreasingalarmfrequencyexposureinourpri-
mary analysis. To explore the stability of our findings, we also
examinednonactionablealarmcountexposuredividedintoter-
tiles and the categories we previously used in our pilot.
Statistical Analysis
We first analyzed the data without the nonactionable alarm ex-
posure variables. We visually examined the relationships be-
tween each exposure variable and nurse response time with
unadjusted Kaplan-Meier failure plots. We then constructed
a multivariable accelerated failure-time model based on the
Weibull distribution20,21 stratified by each nurse with cluster-
ing by patient. This stratified model evaluated the within-
nurse effects of different exposures. Accelerated failure-time
models are comparable with Cox models but emphasize the
time to an event rather than hazards.20,21 We included all of
the variables in the multivariable model regardless of signifi-
cance level to describe the adjusted contribution of each. We
reported the adjusted median response times and 95% confi-
dence intervals for each variable subgroup as estimated in the
model and the P values contrasting pairs of subgroups, ad-
justed for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni method
whenever more than 1 comparison was made. Statistical sig-
nificance was set at P = .05. Since nurse experience does not
vary within nurses, it could not be estimated directly from the
stratified model. We obtained this estimate adjusted for all of
the variables included in the stratified model from a separate
model that allowed for the estimation of nurse-level factors
and accounted for nurse clustering.
We then restricted the data set to alarms occurring after
the first 120 minutes of video recording to estimate the asso-
ciation between nonactionable alarm exposure in the preced-
ingrolling120-minutewindowandtheresponsetimeofnurses.
Weanalyzedtherelationshipbetweennonactionablealarmex-
posure groups and response time and adjusted for all of the
other variables in the theoretical framework in the same mul-
tivariable accelerated failure-time model stratified by nurse
with clustering by patient.

Results
We performed 100 video recordings among 100 patients and

 of experience (range, 2 months-20 years). Most (79%) worked
36 or more hours per week, usually in 8- to 12-hour shifts.
Most patients (82%) were admitted to the general pediat-
rics service, with 18% on the medically complex service. Con-
sistent with the population of the unit, patients were young,
with75%youngerthan6months.Fifty-onepercentweremale.
The race distribution was 45% black or African American, 33%
white, 4% Asian, and 18% other.
We captured 11 745 alarms on video (9582 clinical and 2163
technical), averaging 21.3 alarms per monitored patient-
hour. Alarms per patient ranged from 0 to 484 (median, 90;
interquartile range, 59-163). We excluded 35 alarms (0.3%) for
which a response could not be determined because of camera
obstruction. Overall, 48.9% of the clinical alarms were valid
and 0.5% (50 alarms among 19 patients) were actionable. Fur-
ther details about actionable alarms are in the eTable in the
Supplement. There were no instances of missed alarms that
required emergency assistance in the form of a rapid re-
sponse or code blue team call. Details by alarm type are in
Table 1. The data flow diagram is in the Figure.
The observed (unadjusted) median response time to the
3280 out-of-room alarms was 7.0 minutes (bootstrapped 95%
CI accounting for nurse clustering, 5.2–8.8 minutes). The ad-
justed median response time was 10.4 minutes (95% CI, 5.0-
15.8). The multivariable model results are shown in Table 2.
We found that with each successive hour that passed in a
nurse’
s shift, response time was slower. Nurses with less than
1 year of experience and those in a 1 to 1 nurse to patient as-
signment responded more quickly than nurses with more ex-
perience and those caring for more than 1 patient, respec-
tively. Patients without family members present at the bedside
and those on the complex care service had their alarms re-
sponded to more quickly than those with parents present and
those on the general pediatrics service, respectively. Patients
with prior alarms during the nurse’
s shift that required inter-
ventions were responded to more quickly than those without
priorinterventions.Lethalarrhythmiaalarmsreceivedthefast-
est responses. Patient age, central venous catheters, and na-
sogastric/nasojejunal tubes were not associated with re-
sponse time.
Inevaluatingtheassociationbetweennonactionablealarm
exposurequartilesandresponsetime,wefoundthatthemiddle
quartiles had significantly slower response times than the low-
est quartile, possibly consistent with acute alarm fatigue, but
there was no evidence of a dose-response relationship be-
tween increasing nonactionable alarm exposure and slowing
of response time (Table 3). We examined nonactionable alarm
count exposure divided into tertiles and the groupings we pre-
viously used in our pilot and the results were similar (data not
shown).

 Discussion
This study’
s main findings were (1) alarms for patients on the
complex care service and patients without family members at
the bedside received faster responses than alarms for patients
withoutthosecharacteristics;(2)nursesrespondedfasterifthey
had less than 1 year of experience, if they were in a 1 to 1 assign-
ment,oriftheyhadpreviouslyrespondedtoanactionablealarm
for the same patient that required intervention; (3) lethal
arrhythmia alarms received the fastest responses among all of
thevariableswemeasured;(4)eachhourthatpassedinanurse’
s
shift was associated with longer response times; and (5) the
number of nonactionable alarms to which the nurse was ex-
posed in the preceding 120 minutes was not associated with a
dose-dependent slowing of response time.
It is well established that nurses use intuition and heuris-
tics in clinical decision making.23 We theorize that the deci-
sion whether to respond immediately to an alarm is based on
heuristics, to which many of the factors described earlier con-
tribute. These heuristics are used to make intuitive judg-
ments about the probability that the alarm represents a life-
threatening condition that warrants an immediate response to
prevent patient harm. The finding of faster responses among
the least experienced nurses could be explained by a lack of
chronic alarm fatigue, although alternative explanations (eg,
the least experienced nurses were more nervous or less skilled
at triaging important vs unimportant alarms) are also pos-
sible. Slower response times with each hour of work likely rep-
resents physical and mental fatigue.
Compared with the pilot study we previously published
using the same video recording methods on the same unit,4
response time in this study was faster overall (7.0 vs 9.8 min-
utes) and we did not find a dose-dependent slowing of re-
sponse time with increasing nonactionable alarm exposure.
There are several possible explanations for this. The first is that
this is a larger study with over 5-fold more alarms in the same
setting, and the association seen in the pilot study could have
been incidental. Another possibility is that nursing practices
surrounding alarm management have changed. Since this pi-
lot study was completed, there have been initiatives includ-
ing a communication campaign focused on spreading aware-
nessofthe2014JointCommissionNationalPatientSafetyGoal
that was focused on improving the safety of clinical alarm
systems24 and hospital-wide mandatory education on hospi-
tal alarm policy and practice. These could have blunted some
of the acute alarm fatigue effects seen previously. An addi-
tional difference is that there was nursing turnover on this unit

a Since nurse experience does not vary within nurses, its association with
response time could not be estimated directly from the stratified model. The
adjusted estimate reported here was obtained from a separate model that
allowed for the estimation of nurse-level factors and accounted for nurse
clustering.

 years of experience with a range of 2 months to 20 years. Since
nurses with less experience respond to alarms more quickly,
this might have contributed to the observed differences.
To our knowledge, few other studies have examined fac-
tors that affect response time to alarms. Voepel-Lewis and
colleagues25evaluatedresponsetimestopulseoximetryalarms
in a higher-risk setting, a postoperative orthopedic unit where
one-third of alarms were actionable and the median response
time was under 1 minute. They found a longer response time

Limitations
This study has several limitations. First, it was performed on
just 1 inpatient unit. We did this intentionally to take advan-
tage of the natural experiment that occurs when 1 nurse is ob-
served across multiple patients and many alarms. Despite the
statistical advantages offered by the repeated measures within
nurses, the generalizability is limited. Multicenter studies
would allow us to determine if these findings are externally
valid. Second, while we showed that response time was de-
pendent on several variables, we did not directly measure the
effect of an intervention on response time. As we strive to im-
prove response time so that any alarm that is potentially life-
threatening and occurs while a nurse is outside the room gets
an immediate response, we need to know not only the indi-
vidual factors that predict response time but also the inter-
ventions that are effective in improving it. The next steps in
this line of research could include evaluating the effect of in-
terventions such as shorter shifts and higher nurse to patient
ratios on response time. Additionally, to begin reducing non-
actionable alarms, researchers should develop guidelines es-
tablishingwhichchildrenshouldbemonitored(includingmet-
rics for over- and under-monitoring), what vital signs should
be continuously measured, what settings optimize the detec-
tion of actionable events, and when monitoring should be
discontinued.27,28
Conclusions
We identified a set of patient-, nurse-, and alarm-level factors
thatwereassociatedwithfasterresponsestophysiologicmoni-
tor alarms. We theorize that many of these factors contribute
to the heuristics nurses use to rapidly make intuitive judg-
ments about the probability that the alarm represents a life-
threatening condition that warrants an immediate response to
prevent patient harm. Changing the baseline assumption of
nurses that most alarms do not represent life-threatening con-
ditions will likely require hospitals to critically evaluate their
alarm management practices and commit to reducing low pri-
ority alarms that are unlikely to represent life-threatening con-
ditions. Nurse to patient ratio and physical/mental fatigue
(measured by hours into a shift) represent additional modifi-
able factors associated with response time that should be in-
cluded in intervention studies. Chronic alarm fatigue, the re-
sult of long term exposure to nonactionable alarms during a
nurse’
s career, may be a more important predictor of re-
sponsetimethanshorttermexposuretononactionablealarms.
