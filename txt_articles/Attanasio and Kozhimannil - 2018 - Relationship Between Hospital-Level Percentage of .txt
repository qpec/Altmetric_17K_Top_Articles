Relationship Between Hospital-Level Percentage
of Midwife-Attended Births and Obstetric Procedure
Utilization
Laura Attanasio, PhD, Katy B. Kozhimannil, PhD, MPA
Introduction: Research has shown good outcomes among individual low-risk women who receive perinatal care from midwives, yet little is known
about how hospital-level variation in midwifery care relates to procedure use and maternal health. This study aimed to document the association
between the hospital-level proportion of midwife-attended births and obstetric procedure utilization.
Methods: This analysis used 2 data sources: Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project State Inpatient Database data for New York in 2014, and New
York State Department of Health data on the percentage of midwife-attended births at hospitals in the state in 2014. Using logistic regression,
we estimated the association between the hospital-level percentage of midwife-attended births and 4 outcomes among low-risk women: labor
induction, cesarean birth, episiotomy, and severe maternal morbidity.
Results: Hospital-level percentage of midwife-attended births was not associated with reduced odds of labor induction or severe maternal mor-
bidity. Women who gave births at hospitals with more midwife-attended births had lower odds of giving birth by cesarean (eg, adjusted odds ratio
[aOR], 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.59-0.82 at a hospital with 15% to 40% of births attended by midwives, compared to no midwife-
attended births) and lower odds of episiotomy (eg, aOR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.23-0.74 at a hospital with more than 40% of births attended by midwives,
compared to no midwife-attended births).
Discussion: Our results indicate that hospitals with more midwife-attended births have lower utilization of some obstetric procedures among
low-risk women; this raises the possibility of improving value in maternity care through greater access to midwifery care.

INTRODUCTION
Slightly fewer than 4 million women give birth each year in
the United States, and childbirth is the most common rea-
son for hospitalization.1,2 A growing body of research shows
that low-risk women who receive perinatal care from mid-
wives have favorable birth outcomes and fewer unnecessary
procedures, compared with low-risk women cared for by
physicians.3 The American College of Nurse-Midwives’phi-
losophy of care highlights the importance of partnership be-
tween the woman and midwife as well as not intervening in
the normal process of birth unless complications arise.4 Al-
though use of midwifery care has grown substantially since
the 1980s,5 in 2014, midwives attended 9% of US births2; in
contrast, midwives attend more than two-thirds of births in
some other industrialized countries, including France, Aus-
tralia, and the United Kingdom.6 In the United States, the
majority of midwife-attended births are attended by certi-
fied nurse-midwives (CNMs) or certified midwives (CMs)
in hospitals, where more than 98% of births take place.2
The scope of practice for CNMs varies by state, and even
among states with similar scope-of-practice laws, there is
substantial variation in the proportion of midwife-attended
births.7–9

Changes in use of midwifery care have occurred along-
side changes in care utilization and outcomes of childbirth. US
maternal morbidity and mortality rates have been increasing
over the past several decades.10,11 At the same time, obstet-
ric procedure use has become more common. For example,
rates of labor induction as reported in birth certificate data
have risen from 9.5% in 1990 to 23% of births in 2014,2,12
and one study found that as many as 40% of labor induc-
tions occur without a medical indication.13 More than 32% of
women giving birth in the United States each year give birth
via cesarean.2 There is consensus among experts that this ce-
sarean rate is too high, with negative health consequences for
women and their infants,14 as well as higher costs.15 Wide
variation in cesarean birth rates across hospitals—which is
not accounted for by differences in patient risk—suggests that
clinical training and practice patterns may drive some of the
overuse of this procedure.16
Little is known about how hospital-level variation in the
proportion of births attended by midwives relates to proce-
dure use and maternal health. The presence of midwives in a
hospital could impact the use of procedures if the midwives
themselves are less likely to use procedures such as labor in-
duction or cesarean birth. Beyond the practice patterns of
the midwives themselves, it is possible that midwives prac-
ticing in a hospital could indirectly influence procedure use
by affecting the likelihood of procedure use by all providers
caring for birthing women at that hospital.17 It is also
possible that hospitals choosing to employ larger numbers

 ✦ Evidence shows that midwifery care results in favorable birth outcomes for low-risk women, but little is known about how
hospital-level variation in the proportion of births attended by midwives relates to procedure use and maternal health.
✦ The goal of this study was to document the association between the proportion of midwife-attended births at the hospital
level and obstetric procedure utilization and maternal outcomes among low-risk women, using data from New York State
in 2014.
✦ Hospitals varied substantially in midwifery presence; about 25% of low-risk childbirth-related hospitalizations occurred at
hospitals with no midwife-attended births, while 7% were at hospitals with more than 40% of births attended by midwives.
✦ Births that occurred at hospitals with a higher proportion of midwife-attended births had lower use of some obstetric
procedures, including cesarean and episiotomy.
of midwives may have a greater commitment to low-
intervention birth, whether at the hospital- or labor and
delivery-unit level. The aim of this study was to determine
the association between the proportion of midwife-attended
births at the hospital level and obstetric procedure utilization
and maternal outcomes.
METHODS
Data and Sample
This study is a retrospective, cross-sectional analysis using
2 sources of secondary data: the 2014 Healthcare Cost and
Utilization Project State Inpatient Database for New York, and
New York State Department of Health data on the percentage
of births attended by CNMs or CMs at hospitals in the state in
2014. CMs are educated similarly to CNMs but are individuals
without a nursing background. The CM credential is legally
recognized in certain states only, one of which is New York.
New York State documents the proportion of births attended
by midwives in each hospital, and it makes this information
freely available online. Information about hospitals’maternity
care practices, which includes hospital-level rates of cesarean
birth, episiotomy, and vaginal birth after cesarean, is made
publicly available in compliance with New York’
s Maternity
Information Law.18 Data from the State Inpatient Database
contain 100% of all discharge records from all patients cared
for in community hospitals. This research used deidentified,
existing records and was granted exemption by the University
of Minnesota institutional review board.
Using a validated algorithm for identifying births using
administrative data, we distinguished birth records in hospi-
tal discharge data using diagnosis, procedure, and payment
codes.19 We excluded births from hospitals that had too few
births to meet the requirement to report the percentage of
midwife-attended births in the New York State data (n = 126).
We conducted analyses using a sample of low-risk women
(N = 164,653), identified using diagnostic codes, based on
published criteria identified by the Society for Maternal-Fetal
Medicine.20 Following these criteria, women were excluded
from the low-risk category based on codes indicating multiple
gestation, malpresentation, fetal factors such as hydrocephaly,
uterine or placental factors such as uterine rupture or umbil-
ical cord prolapse, and stillbirth.
Measures
The independent variable in this analysis was the percentage
of births attended by CNMs or CMs by hospital. We coded
hospitals’percentages of midwife-attended births into the fol-
lowing categories: 1) none; 2) up to and including 15%; 3)
more than 15%, up to and including 40%; and 4) more than
40%. We determined these cutpoints empirically based on the
distribution of hospitals and women giving birth in each cate-
gory. We examined whether the largest category—up to and
including 15%—should be further divided, or whether the
percentage of midwife-attended births could be included as
a linear variable. Results were robust to different ways of mea-
suring this variable.
Outcomes for this analysis were constructed using Inter-
national Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9)
diagnosis and procedure codes. We examined 5 outcomes: la-
bor induction, nonindicated labor induction, episiotomy, ce-
sarean birth, and severe maternal morbidity. Cesarean birth
was identified by diagnosis-related group codes 765 or 766,
or ICD-9 codes 740.xx, 741.xx, 742.xx, 744.xx, 749.9. La-
bor induction was identified by ICD-9 codes 73.01, 73.1x,
73.4x, 659.0x, 659.1x. To define nonindicated labor induc-
tions, we excluded childbirth hospitalizations with condi-
tions identified by the Joint Commission as potentially jus-
tifying elective birth prior to 39 weeks’ gestation (leaving
65,228 hospitalizations)21; the remaining cases with induc-
tion of labor were coded as nonindicated. Episiotomy was
identified by ICD-9 procedure code 736; this outcome was
only assessed among women who gave birth vaginally with-
out a diagnosis of shoulder dystocia (n = 133,579). Finally,
we identified severe maternal morbidity based on a validated
algorithm.19,22
Our analyses also controlled for patient-level sociodemo-
graphic characteristics, including age, race/ethnicity, and in-
surance type. We also controlled for the following clinical risk
factors: diabetes (ICD-9 codes 648.8x and 250.xx) and hyper-
tension/preeclampsia/eclampsia (ICD-9 codes 642.0x, 642.1x,
642.2x, 642.3 × 642.4x, 642.5x, 642.6x). We additionally con-
trolled for weekend hospital admission, since literature sug-
gests that obstetric procedure use and outcomes may be dif-
ferent on weekends than on weekdays.23 Individual data on
birth attendant type are not included in these hospital dis-
charge records.

Analysis
We present cross-tabulations of hospitalization characteris-
tics and obstetric procedure outcomes by hospital propor-
tion of midwife-attended births, using chi-square tests to
identify statistically significant variation. We estimated mul-
tivariate logistic regression models for each outcome with
childbirth-related maternal hospitalization as the unit of
analysis. The models employed clustered standard errors to
account for correlation within hospitals. As a sensitivity anal-
ysis, we examined results among all births rather than fo-
cusing on low-risk births only, and results were substantively
unchanged.
RESULTS
There were 134 hospitals in New York State in 2014 with
childbirth hospitalizations identified in the State Inpatient
Database; 126 of those hospitals had a sufficient number
of births to report statistics on births to the New York
Department of Health. Of these 126 hospitals, 33 (26.2%)
had no midwife-attended births. Fifty-five hospitals (43.7%)
had up to and including 15% of births attended by mid-
wives, 22 hospitals (17.5%) had more than 15% and up
to and including 40% attended by midwives, and 16 hos-
pitals (12.7%) had more than 40% of births attended by
midwives.
Characteristics of the study population are shown in
Table 1. Approximately 25% of low-risk women with
childbirth-related hospitalizations in this study gave birth at
hospitals with no midwife-attended births. Fifty percent of
hospitalizations were at hospitals that had 1% to 15% of births
attended by midwives. Seventeen percent occurred at hospi-
tals with 16% to 40% of births attended by midwives, and 7%
occurred at hospitals with more than 40% of births attended
by midwives.
In this sample of low-risk women, 82.4% gave birth vagi-
nally, and 17.6% gave birth by cesarean. Labor induction oc-
curred in 22.8% of low-risk childbirth hospitalizations, with
nonindicated induction in 7.3%. Episiotomy was used in
11.1% of vaginal low-risk births. Severe maternal morbidity
occurred in 1.9% of low-risk childbirth hospitalizations.
In bivariate analyses, sociodemographic characteristics
were associated with the percentage of midwife-attended
births at the hospital (Table 2). Hospitals with no midwife-
attended births had lower proportions of white and black
women giving birth and higher proportions of Asian/Pacific

Islander women and women who identified as “other”
race/ethnicity giving birth. Hospitals with more than 40%
of midwife-attended births had higher proportions of His-
panic and American Indian women giving birth, compared to
hospitals with lower proportions of midwife-attended births.
Women whose births were covered by Medicaid were more
likely to be at hospitals with higher proportions of midwife-
attended births, while women with private insurance were
more likely to give birth at hospitals with no midwife-attended
births. The percent age of midwife-attended births was statis-
tically significantly associated with each outcome (Table 2).
Hospitals with no midwife-attended births had the highest
rates of labor induction, nonindicated labor induction, ce-
sarean birth, episiotomy, and severe maternal morbidity (P �
.05 for all comparisons described).
After adjusting for patient-level sociodemographic char-
acteristics, clinical risk factors, and weekend hospital admis-
sion, the hospital-level percentage of midwife-attended births
was not associated with odds of labor induction (Table 3).
Odds of nonindicated labor induction were lower at hospi-
tals with 1% to 15% and 15% to 40% of births attended by
midwives, compared to hospitals with no midwifery pres-
ence (P � .01). However, odds of nonindicated labor in-
duction were not statistically different at hospitals with the
highest proportion of midwife-attended births, compared to
hospitals with no midwifery presence. As reported in Table 4,
women who gave birth at hospitals with more midwife-
attended births generally had lower odds of giving birth by
cesarean (eg, aOR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.59-0.82; P �.001 at a hospi-
tal with 15% to 40% of births attended by midwives, compared
to no midwife-attended births) and lower odds of episiotomy
(eg, aOR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.23-0.74; P = .003 at a hospital with
more than 40% of births attended by midwives, compared to
no midwife-attended births). Hospital percentage of midwife-
attended births was not associated with women’
s odds of se-
vere maternal morbidity.

cThe severe maternal morbidity variable is based on the CDC’
s definition, which identifies 21 indicators of severe maternal morbidity: acute myocardial infarction, acute renal
failure, adult respiratory distress syndrome, amniotic fluid embolism, aneurysm, cardiac arrest/ventricular fibrillation, disseminated intravascular coagulation, eclampsia,
heart failure/arrest during surgery or procedure, puerperal cerebrovascular disorders, pulmonary edema/acute heart failure, severe anesthesia complications, sepsis, shock,
sickle cell disease with crisis, air and thrombotic embolism, blood transfusion, conversion of cardiac rhythm, hysterectomy, temporary tracheostomy, and ventilation.
Standard errors are adjusted for clustering within hospitals.
DISCUSSION
In New York State, births that occurred at hospitals with a
higher proportion of midwife-attended births had lower use
of some obstetric procedures, including cesarean birth and
episiotomy. Births at hospitals with some midwifery presence
but not the highest proportion of births attended by midwives
(more than 40%) also had lower use of nonindicated labor
induction. These findings are consistent with previous stud-
ies documenting lower obstetric procedure use and similar
maternal and neonatal outcomes among women cared for by
midwives compared to women cared for by obstetricians3,24;
these results indicate that the presence of midwifery care
within a hospital is associated with lower procedure use
as well.
Previous studies have shown that the hospital environ-
ment may be important in determining the provision of
childbirth-related care.16,25 For example, rates of maternal
morbidity and obstetric procedures (cesarean birth and la-
bor induction) vary widely across hospitals, and this varia-
tion is not explained by patient risk factors.16,25–27 Midwives
may be an important factor in influencing the hospital envi-
ronment. The midwifery philosophy of care emphasizes the
inherent normalcy of birth,4 and midwives may bring this at-
titude with them to the labor and delivery unit in ways that
change patterns of care provision.28 Hospital administration
that is supportive of midwifery may shape the broader en-
vironment as well, or be indicative of a commitment to re-
ducing unwarranted procedure use.29 Hospitals where mid-
wives attend a larger proportion of the births may also

 structure their care for women differently; for example, one
hospital combined a midwifery service with a laborist model
of care and found that this resulted in lower rates of primary
cesarean birth and higher rates of vaginal birth after cesarean
(VBAC).30 Findings in the present study may result from less
frequent use of procedures among births attended by mid-
wives alone, but it is also possible that having more midwives
in a hospital changes the culture and practice patterns among
all of the clinicians, staff, and support personnel interacting
with childbearing women in that hospital.
This analysis detected an association between hospital
percentage of midwife-attended births and cesarean births,
episiotomy, and nonindicated labor induction, but no asso-
ciation with severe maternal morbidity or labor induction
overall. Although a review of randomized controlled trials
found no association between midwife-led care and cesarean
birth,3 recent studies in the United States have found mid-
wifery care to be linked to lower cesarean rates among low-
risk women.24,31 A recent systematic review of US studies
also found that the vast majority indicated lower chances of
cesarean birth among women cared for by CNMs in labor
and birth, compared to those cared for by physicians.32 Ce-
sarean birth and episiotomy are 2 obstetric procedures with
the strongest clinical consensus around the benefits of reduc-
ing unnecessary use.14,33 There is still substantial debate about
what the negative health effects of elective labor induction
may be, and particularly about the relationship between labor
induction and cesarean birth.34–39 However, labor induction
may be associated with increased resource use (eg, higher rates
of neonatal intensive care unit [NICU] admission, longer pre-
birth hospital stay, higher rates of epidural analgesia use) com-
pared to expectant management,37,40 although not all studies
have found this to be the case.39 Combining lower utilization
rates for procedures with a lower-cost workforce model, in-
creasing the presence of midwifery in hospital-based mater-
nity care services has potential for reducing costs and improv-
ing value.
Increasing value in maternity care is of particularly ur-
gent importance to state Medicaid programs, which finance
almost half of all US births.41 Added financial pressure may
result from forthcoming changes to the financing of Medi-
caid, if the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act were
to be repealed. This study showed that hospitals with more
midwife-attended births care for a disproportionately larger
share of women with Medicaid versus private insurance, com-
pared with hospitals with fewer midwife-attended births. Hos-
pital payer mix for childbirth affects hospital finances, as Med-
icaid pays approximately half of what private health plans pay
to hospitals for a childbirth.15 More midwives working in hos-
pitals with a payer mix that favors Medicaid may suggest that
a shift toward greater use of high-value maternity services
has already begun among hospitals with more financial con-
straints on resources for their maternity care service lines. In-
creasingly, private payers and hospitals with a greater propor-
tion of private payers may follow their lead, and these results
suggest that greater use of midwifery holds the potential to
increase the effectiveness of care.
Given the finding that midwifery presence at the hospital
level in this study is associated with lower intervention care
among low-risk women, states may want to consider policies
that facilitate the practice of midwifery and greater use of this
type of care. For example, previous research has found that au-
tonomous practice for CNMs is associated with a greater sup-
ply of CNMs, and with a greater likelihood of births being at-
tended by midwives.8 An examination of the nurse-midwifery
environment across all states in 2015 found that New York
CNMs were second out of the 50 states and the District of
Columbia in professional authority.42 Other states may con-
sider whether their regulatory environments may influence
access to and value derived from midwifery care.
Limitations
While this is the first study to characterize the relationship
between hospital-level midwifery presence and obstetric pro-
cedure use, there are some limitations to the analysis. First, we
did not have information on the birth attendant for each child-
birth hospitalization. Therefore, we could not assess whether
the lower procedure use detected was due only to lower pro-
cedure use among midwives or among all maternity clinicians
in hospitals with more midwife-attended births. Further, we
were not able to specifically examine whether midwives
practiced the midwifery model of care. Second, the clinical
characteristics that we were able to control for were limited by
what is available in diagnostic and procedure codes. For exam-
ple, we were not able to include a measure of gestational age,
whether adequate prenatal care had been received, or number
of previous births. Hospitals where larger numbers of mid-
wives work may attract women who are healthier or who have
a stronger preference for a low-intervention birth, in ways that
were not captured with this data. Third, hospitals choosing
to employ larger numbers of midwives may be different from
hospitals that do not employ midwives, and these differences
may be what leads to lower procedure use. Differences could
include hospital characteristics such as birth volume, teaching
status, and rurality, which this analysis did not control for.
Fourth, the ability to detect differences in severe maternal
morbidity in this analysis may have been limited by the rarity
of the outcome. Finally, data came from a single state, and
results may not be generalizable to the entire United States.
CONCLUSION
Women who gave birth at hospitals with a larger percentage
of midwife-attended births were less likely to have a cesarean
birth or an episiotomy. Despite evidence of the potential ben-
efits of midwife-led maternity care, less than 10% of US births
are attended by midwives. The results of this analysis sug-
gest that more midwife-attended births may be correlated with
fewer obstetric procedures, which could lower costs without
lowering the quality of care. This raises the possibility of im-
proving value in maternity care through greater access to mid-
wifery care for childbearing women in the United States.
