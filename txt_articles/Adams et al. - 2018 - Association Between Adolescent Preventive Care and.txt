IMPORTANCE Despite decades of adolescent preventive well visit and services promotion
(Guidelines for Adolescent Preventive Services and Bright Futures), rates are below
recommended levels and little is known of the effect of the Patient Protection and Affordable
Care Act (ACA) implementation on these care rates.
OBJECTIVES To use Medical Expenditure Panel Survey data to determine (1) whether
adolescent well visit rates increased from the pre-ACA period to post-ACA period, and
(2) whether caregivers’ reports of past-year preventive services delivery increased from the
pre- to post-ACA period among adolescents with any past-year health care visit.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Secondary data analysis of 2007-2009 (before ACA
implementation) and 2012-2014 (after ACA implementation) Medical Expenditure Panel
Survey data on the differences in well visits and preventive services. Data were collected
through computer-assisted personal interviews of caregivers of a nationally representative
sample of a noninstitutionalized US population (n = 25 695 10- to 17-year-old adolescents).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES For objective 1, pre- to post-ACA period differences in
past-year well visits: (1) stratified bivariable logistic regressions identifying subgroup rate
differences and (2) multivariable analyses controlling for demographic factors. For objective
2, pre- to post-ACA period differences in caregiver reports of preventive services receipt,
including time alone with clinician: (1) bivariable (year differences) and (2) multivariable
logistic regressions controlling for demographic variables.
RESULTS A total of 6279 (50.9%) and 6730 (50.8%) participating adolescents in the pre- and
post-ACA period data were male, respectively. Under objective 1, we found that well-visit
rates increased from 41% to 48% post-ACA implementation (odds ratio, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.2-1.5);
minority and low-income groups had the greatest increases. Under objective 2, we found that
among those with any past-year visit, most preventive services rates (8 of 9) increased
post-ACA implementation (range, 2%-9%, absolute), with little or no change when
controlling for demographic variables. Time alone with clinicians increased 1%, significant
only when covariates were controlled (adjusted odds ratio, 1.2; 95% CI, 1.0-1.3).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Despite modest to moderate increases, with greatest gains
for underserved youth, adolescent preventive care rates remain low, highlighting the need for
increased efforts to bring adolescents into well care and improve clinician delivery of
preventive care within their practices.

any causes of adolescent morbidity (substance use,
sexually transmitted infections and other sexual
health issues, obesity, and hearing loss) and mortal-
ity (motor vehicle crashes, violence, and suicide) are prevent-
able, making the second decade of life a critical time for pre-
ventive interventions, including interventions in the clinical
setting.1,2 For more than 2 decades, professional health orga-
nizations have recommended the delivery of preventive ser-
vices to adolescents, usually in the context of an annual well
visit.3 Guidelines issued by the American Academy of
Pediatrics in 2017 (Bright Futures) present comprehensive rec-
ommendations for preventive care services up to age 21 years,
including delivery of adolescent preventive services in an an-
nual visit.4 Research supports the effectiveness of clinical pre-
ventive services in several areas in improving adolescent be-
havioral and mental health outcomes. For example, the US
Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening for to-
bacco use, depression, and obesity, among other areas.5
Promising research suggests that preventive services im-
prove adolescent outcomes in additional areas such as nutri-
tion, suicide risk, substance use, and physical activity.6-9
Althoughtheevidencebaseandprofessionalguidelinessup-
port the delivery of preventive services to adolescents, receipt
ofrecommendedpreventiveservicesremainslow.Accordingto
resultsofastudyusingthe2001-2004MedicalExpenditurePanel
Survey(MEPS),ratesofanticipatoryguidanceamongadolescents
who had received a past-year well visit were low, ranging from
31%forseatbeltsto49%forhealthyeating.10Chlamydiascreen-
ing, a US Preventive Services Task Force grade A recommenda-
tion,alsoremainslow(47%-55%in2014)amongsexuallyactive
females ages 16 to 24 years.11 Despite longstanding support for
an annual well visit in professional guidelines, analyses of sev-
eral national surveys from 2011 found rates of past-year well
visits among adolescents to be as low as 43%.12 The analysis of
2001-2004 MEPS data showed a rate of 39%.
Research and professional guidelines also support provi-
sion of confidential care and time alone with a clinician, which
are critical components of preventive services for adoles-
cents. Time alone with a clinician gives adolescents the op-
portunity to learn to interact independently with their clini-
cianaswellastheopportunityfordiscussionofsensitiveissues,
as needed. Several studies indicate that adolescents will forego
needed care without assurance of confidentiality.13-17 Despite
the support of several professional organizations for this as-
pect of quality care,18-21 the analysis of 2001-2004 MEPS data
indicatedthatbarelyathirdofadolescentswithapast-yearwell
visit spent any time alone with a clinician, making it unlikely
that sensitive topics, such as sexual health and substance use,
were addressed.10 This finding may be an underestimation be-
cause the time alone query only includes consideration of the
last health care visit of an unclear nature.
In the context of a strong evidence base and professional
consensus, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act
(ACA), enacted in 2010, requires that most private insurers
cover many preventive services with no copay, including the
servicesrecommendedbytheAmericanAcademyofPediatrics
(Bright Futures)4 and the US Preventive Services Task Force,
grades A and B, as part of a larger focus on prevention through-
out the ACA.22 Since the ACA’s enactment, to our knowledge,
few studies have examined the provision of preventive ser-
vices among adolescents and we are unaware of any studies
examining the provision of confidential care.
In this context, the goal of this study was to examine, in a
nationallyrepresentativesampleofadolescents,changesinthe
receipt of a well visit and the content of care among those who
hadanyhealthcarevisit.Specifically,thepresentstudyhas2ob-

Methods
Study Design and Sampling
Sponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality,
MEPS is a set of household surveys of health, insurance cov-
erage, and health care use and expenditures for the US civil-
ian noninstitutionalized population. The MEPS is conducted
annually and uses an overlapping panel design: each annu-
ally recruited panel of respondents participates for 2 years.
Participants signed consent authorization forms. The
present analysis used 3 MEPS data sets; the Full-Year
Consolidated Data included all study variables except those
needed to develop the well-care visit variable, which were
drawn from the Office-Based Medical Provider Visits and
Outpatient Visits files. The study protocol was approved by the
Committee on Human Research at University of California,
San Francisco, under the exempt status.

Key Points
Question Has the provision of preventive care for adolescents, in
terms of a preventive well visit and preventive services, increased
since implementation of the Affordable Care Act?
Findings This secondary data analysis of the Medical Expenditure
Panel Survey, a national survey, showed that rates of preventive
well visits for adolescents 10 to 17 years of age increased from 41%
(2007-2009) to 48% (2012-2014). Among adolescents who
received any health care visit in the past year, 8 of 9 preventive
services rose, with increases ranging from 2% to 9%.
Meaning Preventive care rates have increased moderately or
modestly; however, most adolescents did not receive past-year
well visits or most preventive services.

 questions about adolescents’ health, health insurance, and
health care use and associated expenditures in the past year.
Objective 1
Under objective 1, we assessed whether rates of past-year well
visits increase from the pre-ACA (2007-2009) to post-ACA
(2012-2014) period. The outcome variable was the receipt of
a well visit within the past year vs none, coded from respon-
dent medical office–based and outpatient health care visits.
The MEPS respondents maintained calendars to track their
health care visits that included visit dates, clinician name and
type, and primary reason for visit. Based on previous re-
search, visits were recoded as a well visit if the main reason
for the visit was a general checkup, well-child examination,
or receipt of immunizations or shots.10,12,23 The well-visit vari-
able was coded as having at least 1 of these visits vs none.
Independent variables were the survey years recoded into
either the pre-ACA (2007-2009) or post-ACA (2012-2014)
period.Stratifiedanalysesofvisitrateswereconductedforrace/
ethnicity, income level, and health insurance status sub-
groups. Race/ethnicity and income group variables were
provided in the MEPS data. The MEPS oversamples policy-
relevant participants including black, Hispanic, and lower-
income subgroups. Race/ethnicity was coded as non-
Hispanic white (referred to as white), non-Hispanic black
(referredtoasblack),non-HispanicAsian(referredtoasAsian),
Hispanic, and non-Hispanic other (referred to as other). The
“other” subgroup was included in the primary outcomes but
not in the stratified subgroup analyses. The MEPS income level
was coded into 4 Federal Poverty Level (FPL) categories
(1: <100% FPL; 2: 100% -<200% FPL; 3: 200% -<400% FPL;
and 4: ≥400% FPL). Insurance status was recoded from
monthly insurance status into a past-year variable: 12 months
of private insurance coverage was recoded as full-year
private coverage; 12 months of public coverage was recoded
as full-year public coverage; at least 1 month but less than 12
months of any coverage was recoded as partial-year
uninsured; and 12 months without any coverage was recoded
as full-year uninsured. A small percentage reported 12 months
of insurance either with both private and public insurance or
some combination. These 2 groups were included in the
primary outcomes but not in stratified subgroup analyses.
Covariate demographic variables used in the multivariable
analysesincludedage,sex,geographicregion,andrace/ethnicity
(exceptingthestratifiedrace/ethnicityoutcomes),incomegroup
(exceptingthestratifiedincomegroupanalyses),andinsurance
status (excepting the stratified insurance group analyses).
Objective 2
Under objective 2, we assessed whether preventive services
rates, among those with any past-year health care visit, in-
creased from the pre-ACA (2007-2009) to post-ACA (2012-
2014)period.Thisobjectiveusedtheadolescentsubsamplethat
hadanyhealthcarevisitinthepastyear(2007-2009:n = 7740;
2012-2014: n = 8559; and total: N = 16 299).
Outcome variables were preventive services items: mea-
surement of physical parameters (height, weight, and blood
pressure) and delivery of anticipatory guidance to the adoles-
cent or parent in 6 areas (healthy eating, physical activity, seat-
belt use, helmet use, second-hand smoke, and dental visits).
Summary measures of whether the adolescent had all 3 physi-
cal parameters measured (yes vs no) and received anticipa-
tory guidance in all 6 areas (yes vs no) were developed. The
time alone with a clinician at the most recent health care visit
variable was included as a separate variable (ages 12-17 years
old). All were compared between the pre- and post-ACA
periods. The independent variable was pre- vs post-ACA
status, as described in objective 1. Covariate variables were the
same as those listed for objective 1.
Statistical Analysis
All analyses were conducted using statistical weights to pro-
vide estimates reflecting national population totals. Weights
are equal to the inverse of the sampling probability for each
case, adjusted for nonresponse. Analyses also included vari-
ables adjusting for the sampling strata and primary sampling
units used in the MEPS complex survey design. χ2 Analyses
were conducted to determine pre- to post-ACA differences in
sex, race/ethnicity, income, insurance, and region.
For objective 1, bivariable logistic regression analyses
wereconductedtodeterminedifferencesinwellvisitsbetween
pre- to post-ACA periods (model 1) and multivariable analyses
controlled for covariate sociodemographic variables (model 2).
For objective 2, bivariable logistic regressions were conducted
todeterminepre-topost-ACAdifferencesinpreventiveservices
(model 1). Using multivariable analyses, model 2 controlled for
demographic covariates. To assure accurate estimation of out-
comesinthestratifiedandsubgroupanalyses,allstatisticalmod-
els included all persons represented in the MEPS data sets.
Analyses were conducted using SAS (SAS Institute Inc) and
SUDAAN(RTIInternational)softwarethattakesintoaccountthe
MEPS complex survey design.24
Results
Demographic and insurance profiles varied significantly from
the pre- to post-ACA periods. There were significant post-
ACA period increases in full-year public coverage (4071 [23%]
vs 5929 [29.8%] in the pre- vs post-ACA periods; P < .001) and
significant decreases in partial- (1981 [13.7%] vs 1699 [11.2%];
P < .001) and full-year uninsured status (1245 [9%] vs 922
[5.3%]; P < .001 in the pre- vs post-ACA periods) (Table 1). In
addition, the Hispanic subgroup had significantly increased
representation in the post-ACA group (4203 [19.8%] vs 5364
[22.8%] in the pre- vs post-ACA periods; P = .005).
Objective 1: Differences in Past-Year Well Visit Rates
From the Pre- to Post-ACA Period
Past-year well visit rates increased from 41% before the ACA to
48%aftertheACA(difference,7%;95%CI,1.2%-1.5%;P < .001)
(Table 2). Stratified analyses showed increases within racial/
ethnic groups (white adolescents: 6%, 95% CI, 1.1%-1.5%,
P < .001; black adolescents: 10%, 95% CI, 1.3%-1.8%, P < .001;
and Hispanic adolescents: 10%, 95% CI, 1.4%-1.7%, P < .001);

significant in model 2, adjusting for covariates.

of Past-Year Preventive Services Among Those
With Any Health Care Visit
Pre- to post-ACA unadjusted preventive services rates in-
creased significantly (model 1) for all 3 measurement para-

nificantly (model 1) (healthy eating: 9%, 95% CI, 1.3%-1.6%,

P < .001; and all 6 areas (2%; 95% CI, 1.0%-1.5%;P < .05). Over-
all, controlling for covariates resulted in little or no attenua-
tion of results (model 2). Time alone with a clinician increased
1% from the pre- to post-ACA period but was only significant in
the analysis adjusting for covariates (95% CI, 1.0%-1.3%).
Discussion
This study provides a comprehensive assessment of well vis-
its receipt and content of care among a national sample of ado-
lescents from pre- to post-ACA implementation. Overall, the
analysis demonstrated modest to moderate significant post-
ACA period increases in receipt of a past-year well visit and in
8 of 9 individual preventive services. While these findings
indicate increases in preventive care, they also illustrate
ongoing gaps: less than half of adolescents attended a well visit
and a similar proportion received anticipatory guidance
among those receiving any health care visit in the past year.
Pre- to post-ACA increases in the receipt of a well visit were
greatest for adolescents in underserved groups—including mi-
nority adolescents, those in lower-income families, and those
with full-year public insurance—indicating that the ACA pro-
visionsdecreasedhealthcareinequities.Despitegainsforthese
groups, their well-visit rates are still lower than those of their
more advantaged counterparts.
Thehigherwell-visitrateamongfull-yearinsuredadolescents
compared with uninsured adolescents indicates that insurance
matters. However, it is not sufficient to ensure the provision of
care:lessthanhalfoffull-yearinsuredadolescentsreceivedawell

that the assessment of preventive services used in this study is
not linked to any particular health care visit, thus, the services
reported may be from sources other than the health care visits
reported by respondents. We have no conclusive evidence that
the changes found from the pre- to post-ACA periods are solely
owing to implementation of the ACA.
Conclusions
Taken together, these findings suggest that while adoles-
cents experienced improvement in receipt of well visits and
preventive services following ACA enactment, rates remain
low. Building on these improvements, efforts are needed to
address family perceptions of the value of the well visit for
this age group and to increase system capacity to provide
preventive services in a confidential setting. These are
highly challenging efforts given that systems are currently
addressing complex changes in the financing and delivery of
health care. At the time of this writing, the future of health
care provisions related to insurance and preventive care—all
aspects of federal health care policy—remain uncertain.
Careful consideration of evidence can help shape delibera-
tions on the best use of federal resources to improve health
and health care.
