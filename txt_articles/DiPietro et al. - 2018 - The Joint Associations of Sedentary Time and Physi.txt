Abstract
Background: The purpose of this study was to determine the joint associations of sedentary time and physical activity with mobility disability 
in older age.
Methods: We analyzed prospective data from 134,269 participants in the National Institutes of Health (NIH)—American Association of 
Retired Persons (NIH-AARP) Diet and Health Study between 1995–1996 and 2004–2005. Total sitting time (h/d), TV viewing time (h/d) 
and light- and moderate-to-vigorous-intensity physical activity (h/wk) were self-reported at baseline, and mobility disability at follow-up 
was defined as being “unable to walk” or having an “easy usual walking pace (<2 mph).” Multivariable logistic regression determined the 
independent and joint associations of sedentary time and total physical activity with the odds of disability.
Results: Among the most active participants (>7 h/wk), sitting <6 h/d was not related to excess disability at follow-up, and those in the 
most active group reporting the highest level of sitting time (≥7 h/d) still had a significantly lower odds (odds ratios = 1.11; 95% confidence 
interval = 1.02, 1.20) compared with those reporting the lowest level of sitting (<3 h/d) in the least active group (≤3 h/wk; odds ratios = 2.07; 
95% confidence interval = 1.92, 2.23). Greater TV time was significantly related to increased disability within all levels of physical activity.
Conclusions: Reduction of sedentary time, combined with increased physical activity may be necessary to maintain function in older age.
Keywords: Exercise, Epidemiology, Functional performance.
The modern-day lifestyle is characterized by a majority of time spent 
sitting and reclining throughout the day. Older people may spend 
up to 60%–70% (10–11 h/d) of their waking hours sitting or reclin-
ing (1), and may be more susceptible to the detrimental effects of 
sedentary time compared with younger or middle-aged people, due 
to a loss of physiologic reserve. The relationship between physical 
inactivity and risk of mobility loss, frailty, and early mortality has 
been well established in the literature (2–4); however, less is known 
about the independent hazards of sedentary time on health and 
function in older age. A recent cross-sectional study using the U.S. 
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 
data from 2003 to 2006 suggests that even meeting moderate-to vig-
orous–intensity physical activity guidelines (≥150 min/wk) was not 
sufficient to ameliorate the negative association between extended 
sedentary time and activities of daily living disability risk among 
older people living in the United States (5). There is also now evidence 
that the deleterious associations often reported between sedentary 
time and chronic disease risk may be attributable to the fact that sed-
entary time displaces time spent in health-accruing lower-intensity 
activity (6); however, most previous analyses have adjusted only for 
moderate-to-vigorous–intensity activity, rather than for total physi-
cal activity. In addition, many studies of sedentary behavior, physical 
activity, and mobility disability in older people are cross-sectional in 
design, which limits our ability to makes causal inferences.
We are not aware of any prospective investigations that have con-
sidered the independent and joint associations of sedentary behavior

 and total physical activity with mobility disability. Moreover, it is 
not clear what level of physical activity is necessary to minimize the 
deleterious effects of large amounts of sitting on mobility disability 
in older people. Accordingly, we analyzed prospective data from 
134,269 participants in the National Institutes of Health (NIH)—
American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) Diet and Health 
Study between 1995–1996 and 2004–2005. We hypothesized that 
self-reported daily sedentary time at baseline would significantly 
increase the odds of self-reported mobility disability at follow-up, 
independent of baseline levels of light-, moderate-, and vigorous-
intensity physical activity. We further proposed that this excess dis-
ability would be accelerated among those with the highest levels of 
sedentary time and the lowest levels of physical activity.
Methods
The NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study was established in 1995–
1996 and comprised 566,398 AARP members (50–71 years) in six 
states and two metropolitan areas who responded to a questionnaire 
about their medical history, diet, physical activity, and sedentary 
behaviors (7). A follow-up questionnaire was completed in 2004–
2006 by 318,714 participants. Those respondents who provided 
complete data on both questionnaires and who were free of chronic 
disease (eg, diabetes, heart disease, emphysema, cancer, or stroke) 
at baseline were eligible to be included in the analysis. To ensure 
the healthiest cohort possible, we also only included people who 
reported their health status as fair or better (N = 134,269; Figure 1).
Assessment of Primary Study Variables
Sedentary time typical of a 24-h period during the past 12 months 
was assessed in the risk factor questionnaire at baseline in two 
ways: (a) time spent sedentary (sitting, TV watching, computer time, 
napping; <3, 3–4, 4–7, and ≥7 h/d) and (b) time spent watching 
TV (0–2, 3–4, and ≥5 h/d). Participants were also asked about the 
typical amount of time per week spent in light-intensity (eg, house-
work, walking, shopping) and in moderate-to-vigorous–intensity 
(eg, brisk walking, yard work, jogging) physical activity over the 
past 10 years (<1, 1–3, 4–7, and >7 h/wk). Physical activity and 
sedentary time questions from the risk factor questionnaire were 
not validated directly, but they have demonstrated expected associ-
ations with colon, rectal, and endometrial cancer risk and mortality 
in this cohort (8–10). Also, to quantify the level of multicollinear-
ity among the physical activity and sedentary time variables, we 
generated variance infiltration factors using least squares regres-
sion modeling. The variance infiltration factor values for total sit-
ting, light, and moderate-to-vigorous intensity were 1.05, 1.27, and 
1.28, respectively, whereas the variance infiltration factor values 
for TV time, light, and moderate-to-vigorous intensity were 1.09, 
1.27, and 1.26, respectively. In general, a variance infiltration factor 
< 2.0 indicates low collinearity among variables. Mobility status at 
the 2004–2005 follow-up was assessed by a question about normal 
walking pace (unable to walk; easy [<2 mph]; normal [2–2.9 mph]; 
brisk [3–3.9 mph]; very brisk [≥4 mph]). Mobility disability was 
defined as a response of “unable to walk” or “easy (<2 mph).”
Statistical Analysis
Univariate analyses (means ± SD, frequencies [%]) first were gener-
ated on all study variables in order to determine their distributions 
within the study population. We assessed collinearity and associa-
tions among the study variables using correlation and chi-square 
tests. Given our fixed cohort with little variation in follow-up time, 
we used logistic regression to evaluate the simple associations of 
each study variable and covariable on the odds of mobility disability. 
Multivariable logistic regression models were then used to determine 
associations between sedentary time and mobility disability when 
adjusting for light-intensity and moderate-to-vigorous–intensity 
physical activity, as well as for the covariables age at entry, sex, race, 
level of educational attainment, change in body mass index (kilo-
gram per square meter) between baseline and follow-up, baseline 
smoking status, and self-reported health at follow-up. These covari-
ables were chosen based on their associations with mobility disabil-
ity in the simple analysis. Total sedentary time and TV viewing time 
were entered into separate multivariable models.
In order to determine the joint effects of sedentary behavior and 
physical activity on disability risk, categorical scores for light activ-
ity were added to scores of moderate-to-vigorous–intensity physi-
cal activity to create a total physical activity variable with scores 
ranging from 0 to 6. Total physical activity score was then divided 
into tertiles based on its distribution (0 = >7, 1 = 4–7, and 2 = ≤3 h/
wk). We tested the joint effects of sedentary time (0 = <3, 1 = 3–4, 
2 = 5–6, and 3 = ≥7 h/d) within each tertile of total physical activ-
ity on mobility disability by creating 12 indicator variables. This 
allowed us to compare directly groups with varying amounts of 
sedentary time and physical activity against those who sat the least 
and also had the most physical activity (referent group). All mul-
tivariable models were adjusted for age, sex, race, level of educa-
tional attainment, smoking, change in body mass index, as well as 
for reported health status at follow-up. These analyses then were 
repeated using categories of TV viewing time as the indicator of 
sedentary behavior. We also conducted a sensitivity analysis in 
which we defined mobility disability only by a response of “unable 
to walk” (n = 3,009) to determine whether any misclassification of 
mobility status may have affected our findings. Odds ratios (OR) 
and 95% confidence intervals (CI) are reported from the final logis-
tic regression models to describe the excess odds of mobility dis-
ability within each level of sedentary time and physical activity 
relative to the referent group.

 Results
Participants were followed for an average of 8.6 ± 0.42 years, and 
the average age at entry was 61.2 ± 5.3 years. Approximately 43% 
of the NIH-AARP cohort were women, 94% were white, and nearly 
45% had a college degree. Twenty-nine percent (n = 38,798) of the 
participants reported mobility disability at follow-up. As indicated 
in Table 1, women, as well as those who reported lower educational 
attainment, poorer self-reported health at baseline and follow-up, 
and smoking at baseline, were significantly more likely to report 
mobility disability at follow-up (p < .001). Also, baseline body mass 
index was significantly higher in those reporting mobility disability 
compared with those who did not (p < .001). Baseline levels of light-
intensity and moderate-to-vigorous–intensity physical activity, as 
well as time per day spent sitting or watching TV were significantly 
associated with reported mobility disability at follow-up (p < .001; 
Table 2), and these simple associations appeared stronger for mod-
erate-to-vigorous activity and for TV viewing compared with light-
intensity physical activity and total sitting time.
Multivariable parameter estimates for the associations of sed-
entary time and of TV time with mobility disability are shown in 
Table 3. After adjustment for light-intensity and moderate-to-vigor-
ous–intensity physical activity, as well as for the covariables of inter-
est, the independent relationship of total sedentary time to mobility 
disability was almost negligible (Model 1). On the other hand, dis-
ability increased in a dose-response manner with increasing category 
of TV time (Model 2). Participants reporting 3–4 h/d of TV viewing 
experienced a 25% higher odds of mobility disability compared with 
those reporting ≤2 h/d (referent group), whereas those people report-
ing ≥5 h/d had a 65% higher odds. These findings also were not 
affected by race, education, change in body mass index, smoking, or 
self-reported health status at follow-up. In both of these models, the 
odds of mobility disability was progressively lower with increasing 
frequency and intensity of physical activity (Table 3), independent of 
sitting or TV time and the remaining covariables. When we removed 
physical activity from these models, the results were relatively 
unchanged (Supplementary Table 1). Also, when we repeated these 
analyses defining mobility disability only by a response of “unable to 
walk,” we observed even stronger effect sizes.
The OR for the joint associations of total sedentary time and total 
physical activity with mobility disability are shown in Figure 2a. We 
observed a dose–response association between increasing levels of sit-
ting time in combination with decreasing levels of physical activity 
and mobility disability at follow-up. Indeed, compared with the refer-
ent group (those reporting <3 h/d of sitting and in the most active ter-
tile [>7 h/wk]), those reporting the most sitting time (≥7 h/d) and the 
lowest levels of physical activity (≤3 h/wk) had over a twofold higher 
odds of mobility disability (OR = 2.17; 95% CI = 2.03, 2.32). Those 
people reporting the highest level of sitting time who reported 4–7 h/
wk of physical activity had a 34% higher odds (OR = 1.34; 95% 
CI = 1.25, 1.43) compared with the referent group, whereas those 
reporting the highest level of sitting but who were the most physically 
active (>7 h/wk) had excess odds of 11% (OR = 1.11; 95% CI = 1.02, 
1.20). Among those in the most active tertile, sitting ≤6 h/d was not 
related to excess mobility disability and those in the most active group 
who reported the highest level of sitting time still had a markedly 
lower excess odds (OR = 1.11; 95% CI = 1.02, 1.20) compared with 
the referent group than did those reporting the lowest level of sitting in 
the least active group (OR = 2.07; 95% CI = 1.92, 2.23). We observed 
no statistically significant interaction between sitting time and total 
physical activity (Wald χ2 = 2.71; df = 6; p > .05), however.
When we repeated these analyses using TV time, the results 
were even stronger (Figure 2b). Within all levels of physical activity,

 increasing amounts of TV time increased the odds of mobility disabil-
ity in a dose–response manner, with almost a curvilinear accelerated 
odds of disability observed with increasing TV time in combination 
with the lowest levels of physical activity. Those people reporting 
the greatest amount of TV time (≥5 h/d) within the lowest tertile 
of physical activity experienced over a threefold increase in odds of 
mobility disability (OR = 3.31; 95% CI = 3.10, 3.53) relative to the 
referent group (0–2 h/d of TV time) in the most active tertile, and 
the odds of disability with ≥5 h/d of TV time among those reporting 
4–7 h/wk of physical activity (OR = 1.94; 95% CI = 1.82, 2.08) was 
nearly similar to that of those watching the least amount of TV, but 
who were also the least active (OR = 1.83; 95% CI = 1.73, 1.94). 
In this latter model, we observed a significant statistical interaction 
between TV viewing time and total physical activity (Wald χ2 = 14.1; 
df = 4; p < .01) indicating that the association between TV time and 
mobility disability varied substantially by level of physical activity.
Discussion
Our findings indicate that sedentary time is a potent risk factor 
for mobility loss in older age that is independent of light-intensity 
and moderate-to-vigorous–intensity physical activity, as well as 
sex, educational attainment, smoking, and prevailing health status. 
Among those people reporting ≥7 h/wk of physical activity, there 
was no significant association between sitting up to 6 h/d and mobil-
ity disability, suggesting that higher levels of physical activity can 
mitigate some of the deleterious effects of prolonged sitting in older 
age. In contrast, increased TV time was significantly associated 
with increased mobility disability at follow-up within all levels of 
reported physical activity—and this was especially so in the least 
active participants.
This prominence of sedentary living has been especially evident 
over the last several decades, as occupational-related energy expend-
iture has declined (11) and passive leisure-time activity (internet use, 
video games, television/movie viewing) has increased. Several recent 
studies now confirm the deleterious association between prolonged 
(ie, uninterrupted) periods of daily sitting and cardiometabolic risk 
(12–15), as well as all-cause, cardiovascular, and cancer mortality 
(16–19)—even after adjustment for leisure-time physical activity 
(which has not changed substantially over the past decades) (20). 
Recent evidence from a large population-based study (21) suggest 
that compared with older people who maintained a sedentary life-
style (ie, >7 h of sitting/day), those who reduced their daily sitting 
time by 3 h/d reduced their 8-year odds of mortality by 14% (hazard 
ratio = 0.86 [0.70–1.05]), whereas those who maintained ≤3 h/d of 
sitting reduced their odds by 25% (hazard ratio = 0.75 [0.62–0.90]), 
independent of reported physical activity level.
Our findings corroborate those of other studies reporting 
sedentary behavior to be a risk factor for loss of physical func-
tion that is distinct from level of moderate-to-vigorous–intensity 
physical activity (5,15,22–25). Reid and colleagues (25) studied 
12-year trajectories of TV viewing time in older adults participat-
ing in the Australian Diabetes, Obesity, and Life-style (Aus/Diab) 
Study between 1999/2002; 2004/2005; and 2011/2012. Their find-
ings indicated that those with either a consistently low or a low, 
but increasing pattern of TV viewing had significantly greater knee 
extensor strength at follow-up, compared with those having a mod-
erate, but increasing viewing pattern. Moreover, two recent cross-
sectional studies using NHANES data from 2003 to 2006 suggest 
that even meeting moderate-to-vigorous–intensity physical activity 
guidelines (≥150 min/wk) was not sufficient to ameliorate the nega-
tive association between extended sedentary time and self-reported 
physical function (15) and activities of daily living disability (5), 
among older people living in the United States. Our findings are also 
consistent with these studies in that the excess mobility disability 
observed with prolonged sitting disappeared only with >7 h/wk (ie, 
420 min/wk) of total activity. Although light-intensity (as well as 
moderate-to-vigorous intensity) physical activity was included in our 
measure, this amount of weekly activity is nearly three times greater 
than the current U.S. Physical Activity Guidelines.
Recent evidence suggests that the deleterious impact of pro-
longed sedentary time on chronic disease risk may be attributable to 
the fact that sedentary time displaces time spent in health-accruing, 
lower-intensity physical activity (6,26) and that when low-intensity 
activity is included in the analysis along with moderate-to-vigorous–
intensity activity, the disease risk associated with sedentary behavior 
diminishes (6). We included light-intensity, as well as moderate-to-
vigorous–intensity activity, in our modeling and also observed that 
the association between total sedentary time and mobility disability 
was negligible; however, TV viewing time continued to demonstrate 
an independent, graded association. Also, implicit in the displace-
ment hypothesis is that replacing sitting time with some type of 
physical activity would be associated with lower disease risk. Using 
an isotemporal modeling approach, Matthews and colleagues (27) 
recently reported a 30% reduction in mortality risk among older 
people who were the least active (<2 h/d of total activity) when 1 h/d 
of sitting was replaced with an equal amount of nonexercise activity,

(1994–1995). Mobility disability was defined as a self-reported walking speed 
of “unable to walk” or “easy (<2 mph)” at the follow-up (2004–2005).

 such as walking, gardening, or household chores. These findings 
underscore the important contributions of light-intensity physical 
activity to health and function in older age.
To our knowledge, this is the first prospective study to consider 
the joint associations of sitting time and total physical activity with 
mobility disability. A recent cross-sectional study of over 4000 com-
munity-living older people reported that each additional hour of sit-
ting time was significantly associated with a lower timed walking 
speed, but this was only evident among those in the lowest quartile 
of moderate-to-vigorous–intensity physical activity (<19.5 min/d) 
(28). Ekelund and colleagues (29) report findings similar to ours 
with regard to the joint associations of physical activity and sit-
ting time with all-cause mortality. Indeed, this harmonized meta-
analysis of prospective data from over one million men and women 
indicated a dose-response relation, with accelerated mortality risk 
observed among those reporting increasing amounts of sitting time 
in combination with low levels of physical activity. These authors 
and others (18,26,30,31) also reported a stronger magnitude of 
effect with TV viewing time compared with total sitting time, which 
may be due to the greater accuracy of reporting structured television 
viewing. Alternatively, people may break up their sitting time more 
frequently during the day compared with when watching TV in the 
evening (30), and in our older study population, the effects of this on 
mobility disability were striking. It is also possible that the combi-
nation of high levels of TV time with low levels of physical activity 
is a marker of underlying chronic disease; however, we controlled 
for self-reported health status at follow-up and still observed excess 
mobility disability.
A major strength of this article is the prospective nature of the 
analysis. Other analyses of sedentary time, physical activity, and 
mobility disability have been cross-sectional in design, thereby pre-

Note: BMI = body mass index; CI = confidence intervals; HS = high school; NIH-AARP = National Institutes of Health—American Association of Retired Per-
sons; OR = odds ratios. Data are from multivariable logistic regression modeling. Total sitting time and TV viewing time were entered into separate models. OR 
and 95% CI are reported to describe the excess risk of disability for each level of sedentary behavior and each level of light-intensity and moderate-to-vigorous–
intensity physical activity relative to the referent group (<3 h/d for sitting; <2 h/d for TV viewing; and <1 h/wk for physical activity).

 exposure and outcome in order to infer causality. Also, few studies 
have considered the role of sedentary time on disease status while 
controlling for total physical activity, and we are the first to also 
consider the joint associations of sitting time and physical activity 
with mobility disability.
We also note the limitations to our analysis. All information on 
sedentary behavior, physical activity, and mobility disability were 
self-reported. People tend to under-report their sedentary behavior 
and over-report their physical activity (32); however, we expect the 
misclassification of sedentary time and physical activity to be nondif-
ferential by mobility disability status, thus attenuating our findings 
toward the null. Also, the top response categories for questions on 
sedentary time (≥7 h/d) and for light physical activity (>7 h/wk) more 
than likely underestimated the full extent of these actual behaviors 
over the course of a day, and this may have minimized the true asso-
ciations between the highest possible amounts of sitting and light 
physical activity to mobility disability. It is also important to note 
that sitting and activity behaviors are interdependent, as time in one 
displaces time in another over a finite 24-hour day. Compositional 
data analysis techniques and isotemporal modeling may be stronger 
statistical methods to capture how shifts in the relative amounts of 
sitting, light-intensity, and moderate-to-vigorous–intensity physical 
activity over the course of the day affect health. Unfortunately, the 
categorical responses to questions about sedentary time and physi-
cal activity on the NIH-AARP risk factor questionnaire cannot ade-
quately capture the data needed for the appropriate application of 
such analytic techniques. Finally, scores for the frequency of light and 
moderate-to-vigorous physical activity were added together to create 
a summary index ranging from 0 to 6. Similar to other composite 
scores (eg, MET-h/wk) it, therefore, was not possible to discern the 
distinct contributions of light, moderate, or vigorous intensity to a 
given summary score.
Mobility disability status was not assessed by the baseline risk 
factor questionnaire, and even though we restricted the analysis to 
those without chronic disease and who reported their health as fair or 
better, we may have missed some prevalent cases of mobility disabil-
ity at baseline. Those with existing disability probably reported more 
sedentary time and less physical activity at baseline, which could have 
artificially inflated the magnitude of the associations between these 
behaviors and mobility disability at follow-up—even after adjustment 
for prevailing health status. Unfortunately, we have no way of deter-
mining the extent of any misclassification of baseline mobility status. 
Also, the question assessing mobility was based on perceived usual 
walking pace and may have lacked accuracy. The Walking Impairment 
Questionnaire (WIQ) (33) was developed as a measure of self-per-
ceived walking performance and contains questions about walking 
speed that are similar to ours. Scores for perceived walking speed from 
the WIQ correlated significantly with timed walking speed in a sample 
of older people with and without peripheral artery disease, thereby 
providing evidence of the validity of this questionnaire (33).
Our findings are based on only 24% of the original NIH-AARP 
cohort and 94% of this sample was white and of higher educational 
attainment. Although the sample size was still adequate to ensure 
the precision of our estimates, it is not clear how generalizable these 
findings are to the U.S. population of older adults—especially to 
minority or to less affluent older populations.
In sum, our findings and those of others indicate that reductions 
in sedentary time, as well as increases in physical activity, are nec-
essary to maintain health and function in older age—particularly 
among those who are the least active. Current U.S. public health 
recommendations for physical activity have not addressed sedentary 
time, but our results suggest doing so may be useful for reducing 
mobility disability. Given aging demographics and the global eco-
nomic burden associated with aging- and disuse-related disability, 
there is a tremendous public health benefit to understanding the 
extent to which those determinants of mobility disability can be 
modified in older age.

Figure 2. The joint association between daily sedentary time (h/d; a) or TV 
viewing time (h/d; b) and total physical activity (h/wk) on mobility disability 
in the National Institutes of Health—American Association of Retired Persons 
(NIH-AARP) Diet and Health Study cohort (N = 134,269). This joint analysis 
allowed us to compare directly groups with varying amounts of sedentary 
time and physical activity against those who sat the least and also had the 
most physical activity (referent group). Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence 
intervals (CI) are reported from the final logistic regression models to 
describe the excess odds of mobility disability within each level of sedentary 
time and physical activity relative to the referent group. All models were 
adjusted for age, sex, race, level of educational attainment, smoking, change 
in body mass index, as well as for reported health status at follow-up.
