Abstract
This paper reports the impact of a major life event–death–on the physical, psychological
and social well-being of the deceased’s close friends. We utilised data from a large longitudi-
nal survey covering a period of 14 years (2002–2015) consisting a cohort of 26,515 individu-
als in Australia, of whom 9,586 had experienced the death of at least one close friend. This
longitudinal cohort dataset comprises responses to the SF-36 (health related quality of life
measure) and allowed for analysis of the short and longer-term impacts of bereavement. In
order to manage the heterogeneity of the socio-demographics of respondents who did/not
experience a death event, we use a new and robust approach known as the Entropy Balanc-
ing method to construct a set of weights applied to the bereaved group and the control group
(the group that did not experience death). This approach enables us to match the two
groups so that the distribution of socio-demographic variables between the two groups are
balanced. These variables included gender, age, marital status, ethnicity, personality traits,
religion, relative socio-economic disadvantage, economic resources, and education and
occupation and where they resided. The data show, for the first time, a range of negative
and enduring consequences experienced by people following the death of a close friend.
Significant adverse physical and psychological well-being, poorer mental health and social
functioning occur up to four years following bereavement. Bereaved females experienced a
sharper fall in vitality, suffered greater deterioration in mental health, impaired emotional
and social functioning than the male counterparts up to four years after the death. The data
show that the level of social connectedness plays an important role in bereavement out-
comes. Specifically, we found that less socially active respondents experienced a longer
deterioration in physical and psychological health. Finally, we found evidence that the death
of a close friend lowered the respondent’s satisfaction with their health. Since death of
friends is a universal phenomenon, we conclude the paper by reflecting on the need to rec-
ognise the death of a close friend as a substantial experience, and to offer support and ser-
vices to address this disenfranchised grief. Recognising bereaved friends as a group
experiencing adverse outcomes can be used internationally to prompt health and psycho-
logical services to assist this specific group, noting that there may be substantial longevity to

 the negative sequelae of the death of a friend. Facilitating bereaved people’s support net-

Introduction
In most circumstances, grief is a natural response to bereavement. As part of the grieving pro-
cess, people adjust and adapt to their loss, but the level of adaptation, and the corresponding
emotional, behavioural, psychological and physical responses differ depending on the bereaved
individuals’ age [1–4], ethnicity [5], personality traits [6–8], religiosity [9–12], resilience [13,
14], the support they received [15], and the relationship they have with the deceased [16, 17].
Much of the prior research on bereavement confines the focus to the death of a first-degree
relative, often a spouse [14]. Within this body of work, the focus is generally on how bereave-
ment influences the risk of mortality [14, 18], physical health and mental wellbeing of the sur-
viving members [14, 17, 19]. There is an emerging body of work looking at predictors of
bereavement outcomes, both theoretically [20] and empirically [21–24]. The latter has been
extended to complicated grief which has attracted a lot of attention over the past decade
because of its clinical implication for palliative care support [24].
Non-kinship bereavement, however, receives surprisingly little attention in the literature,
even though it is a ubiquitous experience. Grieving the death of a friend is an experience
which receives less social support because the relationship is of lower status than kin, and
hence a form of disenfranchised grief [25, 26]. Non-kin grief may not be openly acknowledged
or expressed, and the psychological or physical impacts of the grief may be regarded as illegiti-
mate [26]. Therefore, the impact of bereavement of a friend may be trivialised, or at least not
afforded the same status, with diminished right to grieve, as that of kin bereavement.
Existing studies on non-kinship bereavement are limited, and they focus almost exclusively
on older adults [27–30]. The finding of these studies are mixed, possibly due to heterogeneity
between the bereaved and the non-bereaved group. Their sample size are small, and they lack
appropriate control variables to address the sociodemographic differences in the sample. Large
scale data sets on non-kin relationships are rare, making such study difficult.
A study by Ackerman and his colleagues explored the question “Is friendship akin to kin-
ship?” [31]. Drawing on theories in the psychology and evolutionary biology literature they
argued that psychology of friendship may mimic that of kinship [32–34]. Ackerman et al’s
findings imply that when a close friend dies, bereavements may be experienced in a way simi-
lar to the death of kin. In a large and dense social network, possible reinforcement of distress
can reduce the supporting function of the network. For example, when a member of the social
network dies, several other members within the network also experience varying levels of dis-
tress from bereavement, and this can cause network stress [35]. Presence of network stress
implies a positive association between the density of the network and negative bereavement
outcomes.
In contrast to the network stress argument, a recent study used data of more than 15,000
Facebook networks and studied the social network response following the death of a close
friend [36]. They found interactions among friends of decedents intensified and reached a sta-
ble level a year after death. This result suggests that social network exhibits resilience and
online social interactions represent a form of social support during and after the acute grieving
period.

 Building on the findings of the bereavement literature and Ackerman et al, we explored the
research question of whether bereavement of a close friend exhibits physical and psychological
features similar to the death of kin which has been documented in the bereavement literature.
More specifically, we hypothesised that even though a person with a broad social network may
experience a greater chance of losing a friend, they tend to cope better with grief because their
social network may provide a good source of emotional support through the bereavement pro-
cess, and companionship protects bereaved individuals from despair and loneliness [15, 37].
This implies that those who are socially isolated or less engaged with social activity are
expected to exhibit less resiliency to grief than those who are socially active [38, 39].
Methods
Data source
Our data came from The Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA)
Survey. The survey is funded by the Federal Government and is one of the largest longitudinal
surveys in Australia starting in 2001 (wave 1) comprising 7,682 households and 19,914 adults.
The last wave (wave 15) comprised 17,606 households and 23,292 adults. Samples size varies
across waves due to loss to follow-up death or changes in household composition. Further an
additional top-up sample was added in wave 11, of 2,153 households (comprising 5,451
individuals).
Survey participants
Survey participants are interviewed and followed annually. The survey collects information on
household and family relationships, income, employment, health and education. It comprises
four sets of questionnaires; (1) a household form, (2) a household questionnaire, (3) a individ-
ual questionnaire for all household members aged 15 years and above, and (4) a self-comple-
tion questionnaire (SCQ). Questionnaires are collected at a later date or returned by post. The
SCQ contains a rich set of questions including 36 items that were subsequently aggregated into
8 scales measuring various domains of well-being called the Short Form 36 (SF-36) (reference
for SF-36). Each of these eight scales are transformed by HILDA into an index ranges between
0 and 100, where 0 is poor and 100 is excellent.
Variables and measures
We utilised the respondents’ SF-36 scores on five domains to measure outcomes of bereave-
ment. The five domains are general health, vitality, mental health, role limitations due to emo-
tional problems and social functioning. A previous study examined the validity of the SF-36
scores reported in the HILDA survey and found that they are comparable to published SF-36
normative data and hence can be interpreted in a similar way [40]. In addition to the SF-36,
we included one additional survey item that asked how satisfied respondents were with their
health and overall life, ranging from 0 (totally dissatisfied) to 10 (totally satisfied).
Our analysis relied on a specific set of questions in the survey concerning whether and how
long ago (0 to 3 months ago, 3–6 months ago, 6–9 months ago, 9–12 months ago) the respon-
dents experienced a “life event”. The life event analysed for this paper was the death of a close
friend. The event timing question allowed us to infer the timing of the death event at the quar-
terly interval. Using this life event as the “treatment variable” we tracked the short-term and
long-term impact of this death on the respondents’ physical and psychological well-being,
mental health, social functioning and life satisfaction.

 Our longitudinal analysis covered survey responses from wave 2 (2002) to wave 15 (2015).
Wave 1 was excluded because it did not contain a survey question on death. Household resi-
dents who were not the responding person to the interview or did not complete the SCQ for
the life event questions were excluded from our sample. Our final sample size per wave varied
depending on whether they responded to the life event questions and to other questions sur-
rounding their well-being and activities (see Table 1). Our final sample comprised 26,515 indi-
viduals who responded to the life event question on the death of a close friend in one or more
waves of data collection. This amounts to a total of 168,104 responses over a 13-year period. Of
26,515 respondents, 9,586 (36%) reported to have experienced the death of a close friend over
the past 12 months, which amounts to 18,961 death events.
The data also report a second question about death, specifically the death of a family mem-
ber (excluding spouse and child) over the past 12 months. Combining the positive responses
of this question (19,522) and the positive responses of the death of a close friend (18,961) gives
us a combined percentage of 22%, which was almost perfectly in line with national statistics
reported in the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) where 22% of Australians experienced
the death of a family member or close friend over the past 12 months [41].

This Table presents descriptive statistics of the full sample including, whether the respondents had experienced death of a friend in the past year, and respondents’
demography which includes gender (dummy variable equals 1 for female), age, ATSI (dummy variable equals 1 for Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander), marital status
(dummy variable equals 1 if married), highest education level ranging from 1 (if completed a postgraduate degree) to 9 (if completed year 11 or below), whether the
respondent resides in a remote area (dummy equals 1 if residing in outer regional cities, remote and very remote Australia based on the Australian Standard
Geographical Classification–Remoteness Area, and 0 if residing in major cities/inner regional cities, and decile index for relative socio-economic disadvantage,
economic resources, and education and occupation. Five personality character traits (agreeableness, conscientiousness, emotional stability, extroversion and openness to
experience) are summarised. Level of social activity are reported (ranging from 1 (everyday) to 7 (less often than once every 3 months)). Religion is a dummy variable
equals 1for any religion.

 A key variable of interest was participants’ level of social engagement. It was based on the
survey question probing the extent to which respondents get together socially with friends/rel-
atives that are not living with them (ranging from 1 (everyday) to 7 (less often than once every
3 months)). Respondents were considered to have a low level of social activity if they met
socially at most once every month. We redefined low social activity as meeting socially with
family/friends at most 2–3 times per month and we obtained qualitatively similar results.
We matched and controlled for the respondents’ socio-demographics including age, gen-
der, personality trait, religion, ethnicity (Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders), marital status,
urban/rural residence, and their socio-economic status based on the area they lived. HILDA
survey respondents were questioned on their personality traits using a 36-item inventory. We
also matched and controlled for the respondents’ five personality traits that may have impact
on their social engagement and have a moderating effect on depressive symptoms following
death, because they relate the psychological responses to loss [42]. These variables also relate
individuals’ resiliency, adaptive capacities and the ability to cope in response to stressor [43].
For example, extroverted people may better manage their emotional stress because they are
more receptive to support from others. Based on Goldberg’s Big Five personality trait descrip-
tive adjectives approach [44, 45], HILDA reports survey items into five personality character
traits: agreeableness, conscientiousness, emotional stability, extroversion and openness to
experience. It was reported in waves 5, 9 and 13. Since personality traits are reasonably stable
over time, for the purpose of identifying heterogeneity across respondents, we used the average
value across the three waves as proxy for each respondent’s personality trait scale. Our results
remained largely unchanged when the backfilled values of the respondent’s personality trait
scale were used.
Respondents were asked about their religion in waves 4, 7, 10, 14. We created a dummy var-
iable which equalled 1 if the respondent was reported to have any religion and 0 if they have
no religion. For non-reporting waves, we backfilled missing values using the first available
data. For example, religion data in waves 2 and 3 was backfilled using data from wave 4. For
wave 15, data from wave 14 was used.
We also controlled for respondents’ marital status and whether they lived in a remote area.
Married couples typically receive support from partners and thus are hypothesised to experi-
ence a reduced impact of bereavement.
Finally, based on ABS’s socio-economic indicators for areas (SEIFA) from the 2001 census,
we controlled for level of socio-economic disadvantage, the level of economic resources, and
education and occupation. The Indices reported in HILDA corresponds to SEIFA scores from
the ABS Census data.
Methodology
One of the challenges in this study was to match the two groups of respondents (those that
were bereaved and those that were not) given that there are a multitude of factors affecting the
bereavement outcome. Instead of conducting one-to-one matching, we matched both groups
according to the data distribution of each respondents’ socio-demographics. In doing so, we
employed Entropy Balancing (EB) matching [46]. This procedure is essentially a data pre-pro-
cessing procedure that reweights the control sample to improve the level of independence
between the treatment variable (bereavement) and the respondents’ socio-demographics. The
method involves constructing a set of weights applied to each observation in the control
group, i.e. the group that did not experience the death, so that distributional balance (mean,
variance and skewness) of covariates between the two groups can be achieved. To obtain the
optimal weights wi, the procedure involves minimising Kullback’s entropy divergence [47], H

riðXiÞ is the set of balance constraints imposed on the moment k of each
covariate Xi in the reweighted control group. D is dummy variable that equals 0 if the sample
belongs to the control group.
In contrast to propensity score matching which is a popular method for estimating the
treatment effect in observation studies, EB approach is superior because (i) it does not discard
samples with low matching scores so it prevents information loss, and equations (ii) it does
not rely on how well the propensity score models are fitted in the first stage to obtain the score
weights, as EB directly adjusts the weights to the known sample moments to achieve a high
level of covariate balance [46].
EB matching procedure and data analysis were executed using STATA 14 statistical soft-
ware (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX). Using the weights obtained from EB procedure, we
then used the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) to estimate the treatment effect by regressing the
well-being measures against the treatment variable: DEATH (a dummy variable that equals 1 if
the subject experience the death, and 0 otherwise) and an interaction term to tease out the
marginal effect of gender and social activity. For example, if the interaction term: DEATH×-
LOW SOCIAL ACTIVITY is negative and statistically significant in the SF-36 outcome regres-
sion, bereaved individuals with low social engagement experienced poorer bereavement
outcome than bereaved individuals with high social engagement. In our weight-adjusted OLS
regressions, we included respondents’ socio-demographics as control variables. Coefficients of
the treatment variable, interaction terms, and their corresponding p-values (two-tailed t-test)
were reported. For brevity, we did not report the estimated coefficients of the control variables.
Since we are testing five domains of welling being over multiple time points, we applied Benja-
mini-Hochberg procedure [48] to adjust for a false discovery rate of 5%. The coefficient is con-
sidered to be significant if the p-value is less than Benjamini-Hochberg critical value. The total
number of observations used in this study was 168,104.
Findings
Table 1 presents the descriptive statistics of respondents’ socio-demographic characteristics
separated out by bereaved and non-bereaved groups. It shows that the two groups of respon-
dents were quite different socio-demographically (as t-tests were all statistically significant at
the 5% level). The two groups were not comparable at baseline so the use of EB procedure to
reweight the non-bereaved control group made the groups comparable based on the distribu-
tion of their socio-demographic characteristics.

 First, there was a slightly greater female concentration in the bereaved group (54% bereaved
vs 53% control, p-value = 0.03). Compared to the non-bereaved group, the bereaved group was
significantly older (53 vs 43, p-value < 0.01), less educated, more religious (75% vs 66%, p-
value < 0.01), resided in a more remote part of Australia and resided in economically disad-
vantaged areas (i.e. lower income families and people with little training and in unskilled occu-
pations) and lesser educational attainment and skilled occupations (p-values < 0.01).
Personality traits of these two groups of respondents also differed statistically. The bereaved
group reported higher rates of agreeableness, conscientiousness, emotional stability, extroversion
but scored lower on the scale of openness to experience. At least three of these attributes are
associated with broader social network and higher level of social activity, which is in line with
lower level of social isolation reported in the last row of Panel A. The bereaved cohort were
more emotionally stable, possibly due to the age gap between the two cohorts; older people
tend to be more emotionally stable than young people [49].
Tables 2 and 3 present evidence that there was a correlation between gender and social
activity. For the bereaved group (Table 2), 80% of female respondents met friends/relatives
more than once a month, whereas for males, the corresponding statistic was 4% lower (p-
value < 0.01). For the non-bereaved group, the corresponding difference was similar. This cor-
relation suggests that females are likely to have a broad social network and thus may receive
more bereavement support.
Fig 1 presents the impact of the death on well-being measures from the year prior to death
to two years after death across bereaved and non-bereaved respondents. There are two patterns
that stand out from the figure. First, after applying the EB procedure to reweight the sample
and adjusting for the respondents’ socio-demographics, Fig 1A–1F show that the death of a
close friend is associated with poorer self-reported general health, lower vitality, poorer mental
and psychological well-being, greater interference with normal social activities, greater role
limitations caused by emotional problems, and lower life satisfaction following the death. The
difference between the two groups at each time point from 0–3 months up until 22–24 months
were statistically significant with at the 5% level (p-value < 0.01).Note that after reweighting,
the first three moments of the distribution (mean, standard deviation and skewness) of all
covariates were matched almost perfectly.
Second, there is a notable pattern in well-being metrics and (with the exception of general
health) all show marked decline at about 6 months after death, followed by a recovery. Apart
from overall life satisfaction, all metrics demonstrate small but varying level of deterioration
shortly after recovery.
Table 4 reports the result by the respondent’s social activity. Respondents who were classi-
fied as socially inactive (met with friends/family at most once a month) suffered a significant

This Table presents descriptive statistics of the level of social activity of the bereaved group sample. Level of social activity are reported (ranging from 1 (everyday) to 7
(less often than once every 3 months)). If the respondents met with their friends/relatives less than or around once a month, their level of social activity is considered to
be low.

 long-term deterioration in vitality, mental health, role-emotional and social functioning, with
the greatest impact occurring around 7–9 months after the death. They were significantly less
satisfied with their life and health compared with the matched non-bereaved group. For
socially active respondents, the greatest impact occurred around the anniversary of death, fol-
lowed by a steady recovery. While death of a close friend did not seem to decrease their life sat-
isfaction, they were not satisfied with their health up to two years after death, and this
corresponds to their overall grief-associated poorer health. Full results of Table 4 can be found
in S1 Table.
Ackerman et al report that females respond to friends as though they are their kin more
than the male counterparts. Table 5 shows that bereaved females consistently experienced
lower vitality, suffered greater deterioration in mental health, suffered greater limitation on
their routine activities and social functioning than bereaved males as the coefficients of the
interaction term are negative and statistically significant across all time periods. In contrast to
the spousal bereavement literature suggesting that mental health tends to improve over time
and approaches to the normal level by the 4th year [50], we show that there exists an interesting
U-shaped pattern; the impact declines after the first 3 months and reaches the lowest level at
around 7–9 months and rises through to the 4th year after death. Our result suggests that
females experienced longer term deterioration of physical and psychological well-being follow-
ing the death of a close friend. Our data may reflect hypotheses that females share tighter and
had greater socioemotional bonds than their male counterparts [51–53]. Full results of Table 5
can be found in S2 Table.
Finally, we found that the impact on males was comparatively smaller. The positive and sig-
nificant coefficients in year 4 (and some in years 3 and 2) suggest that bereaved males experi-
enced long term improvement in vitality, mental health, role-emotional and social
functioning. Our life satisfaction regression indicates that bereaved males were more dissatis-
fied with their life and health in the short term (up to 1 year) while bereaved females were
more dissatisfied in the long term (2 year and beyond). It is not clear whether their dissatisfac-
tion was partly due to long term grief-associated outcome.
Discussion
Our results offer, for the first time, insight into the bio-psychosocial impacts of the death of a
close friend. The data are significant in establishing bereaved friends as an important cohort
who may require physical and emotional support in the four years following the death. The
data are drawn from a nationally representative sample of Australian households, with a sam-
ple size of 9,586 people who had experienced the death of at least one close friend making this
the largest study of its kind to date.

This Table presents descriptive statistics of the level of social activity of the non-bereaved group sample. Level of social activity are reported (ranging from 1 (everyday)
to 7 (less often than once every 3 months)). If the respondents met with their friends/relatives less than or around once a month, their level of social activity is
considered to be low.

 The data show that the bereaved and the non-bereaved cohort have very different sociode-
mographic characteristics. Specifically, the bereaved group was older, less educated, more reli-
gious, and they lived in areas of socio-economic disadvantage, lower economic resources,
Fig 1. Short term and long term impact of death of a friend over time. This figure presents the impact of the death of a friend on their well-being (separated by
gender) over time. The well-being measures include the adjusted mean scores of Short Form 36 Questionnaire (SF-36) scores on the respondent’s general health,
vitality, mental health, role limitations due to emotional problems and social functioning. The mean scores were adjusted by respondents’ socio-demographics
including age, marital status, ethnicity (ATSI), level of education, remoteness, personality traits, religion, socio-economic disadvantage, economic resources, and
education and occupation.

This table presents the weighted OLS regression result on the difference between numerous measures capturing the respondents’ vitality level, mental health, and
general health, role emotional and social functioning after matching groups of respondents who had experienced death of a friend in the past year against the
respondents’ socio-demographics including age, marital status, ethnicity (ATSI), level of education, remoteness, personality traits, religion, socio-economic
disadvantage, economic resources, and education and occupation. Non-bereaved group is reweighted using the Entropy Balancing (EB) procedure so that the
distribution (mean, variance and skewness) of the socio-demographic variables are matched to the bereaved group. The dependent variables include the Short Form 36
Questionnaire (SF-36) scores on the respondent’s vitality, mental health, general health, role limitations due to emotional problems and social functioning (transformed
into a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 is poor and 100 is excellent), how satisfied they are with their life and health (ranging from 0 to 10). In order to isolate the
interdependency between gender and social activity, we also match respondent’s gender in addition to the respondents’ socio-demographics. We report the coefficient
of the dummy variable DEATH, which equals 1 if the respondent experienced death in the relevant time period. We also report coefficient of the interaction variable
DEATH×LOW SOCIAL ACTIVITY, where LOW SOCIAL ACTIVITY is a dummy variable equals 1 if the respondent was reported to meet family and friends socially at
most once every month.
Asterisk (�) is inserted next to the reported p-value if it is less than Benjamini-Hochberg critical value.

 lesser education attainment and skilled occupation. Existing works shows that younger
bereaved people present with more pronounced grief than older counterparts, but older people
tend to experience greater loneliness [1, 3, 4]. The literature shows that religion in general has
a positive impact on grief as it helps individuals to handle major crises such as death, and reli-
gious communities often provide social support to help individuals cope with their loss [9, 12,
54]. Different personality traits will impact adaptation during bereavement. Individuals with
higher self-esteem are more capable of withstanding stress [55]. Positive emotions buffer indi-
viduals against anxiety and depression resulting from bereavements [7, 8, 56]. People who
score high on ‘neuroticism’ are more emotionally fragile and they are more likely to experience
bereavement maladjustment [57].

 Personality traits also affect people’s social activity. People who are agreeable tend to behave
altruistically and are more pro-social [58] and thus they are more likely to be selected as poten-
tial friends [59]. However, it is also possible that bereavement triggers other friends to rally
round and be in contact with them, leading to an increase in social network activity [36].
Extroverted people engage in more social activities as they are more likely to experience posi-
tive affect from social activity [58], and therefore they are more motivated to make new
friends. People who are not conscientious are expected to exhibit poorer self-control and are
more likely to engage in prejudiced behaviour and poorer interpersonal interactions [59–61].
However, some studies found little evidence of the association between conscientiousness and
the size of friendship network because being conscientious may lead to higher peer acceptance
and helps with maintaining friendship rather than making new friends [59].
After matching and controlling for the sociodemographic differences between the bereaved
and non-bereaved groups, we found evidence supporting the argument that greater social
engagement can harness more support throughout the bereavement process. For those who
were socially isolated or have less social engagement, they were less resilient to grief and the
impact could last at least four years. This result differs from recent research [36], which sug-
gested that friends of a decedent become more engaged with each other. Further analysis
revealed that females experienced greater negative bereavement outcomes, which may be
attributed to gender difference in psychological kinship; females share tighter and had greater
socioemotional bonds than their male counterparts [51–53]. Results also showed that males
had lower life satisfaction in the short-run (within the first year of the death) and while females
had less life satisfaction in the long run (2 years and beyond after the death), and this may be
associated with prolonged impact of bereavement in females.
Our results present an alternative explanation for the gender difference in bereavement out-
comes. Studies show that mortality risk is higher for widowers than widows [14, 62], but wid-
ows are more likely to become depressed [63–65]. Research shows that higher baseline levels
of depressive symptoms among females may predispose them to higher risk of developing
grief-related depressive disorder [64]. However, it is not clear whether widows were employing
more effective coping strategies in dealing with grief than widowers [66]. Others argued that
males are more vulnerable to depression following widowhood because they suffer more social
deficit [67].
Death of a friend is a universal human experience. Yet friends rank low on the grief hierar-
chy, and friends are considered lesser mourners than relatives.[68] The long-lasting bereave-
ment outcomes of friends found in our data have international significance, in advocating to
disrupt bereavement of a friend as a disenfranchised grief. If the death of a friend continues
unchallenged in this category, then it will be all the more difficult for the grievers to overcome
the emotional and physical impact of bereavement.
We provide evidence from a robust analysis of a large and representative dataset, for alert-
ing bereavement services and the medical system to consider those most likely to experience
adverse bio-psycho-social consequences to the death of a friend. Perhaps, in the absence of
complex grief [21], a useful focus could be on connecting people to social networks or religious
communities to harness emotional support. Such support is essential for fostering better
bereavement adjustment, reducing the likelihood of developing prolonged depressive and
physical symptoms. This also connects with the move toward community based approaches to
death, dying and bereavement [69]. Specifically, an awareness by general practitioners and pri-
mary care health practitioners of the potential vulnerability of bereaved people up to four years
post loss could allow them to be more proactive in recognition of grief-related presentations
and providing subsequent support.

 There are several limitations to our study. First, since our results rely on data from self-
completion questionnaires, we may overestimate the gender effect due to self-reporting bias;
females may be more willing to recognise and acknowledge health problems than males. Sec-
ond, we were unable to determine from the data whether respondents developed uncompli-
cated or complicated grief, which has clinical significance, particularly following its inclusion
as a new diagnostic criteria in DSM-V [14, 70]. Third, the data do not provide detailed infor-
mation about the nature and causes of death which can be important risk factors driving the
intensity of grief [71, 72]. For example, violent death [73, 74], unnatural death [75] and unex-
pectedness or unpreparedness of death [37, 76, 77] can increase the chance of developing com-
plicated grief, and hence some of the bio-psychosocial impacts reported in this paper.
Conclusion
Bereavement often leads to psychological distress, yet to date there has been a lack of robust
data which demonstrates the impact following the death of a close friend. Friends’ responses to
bereavement are influenced by the person’s age, gender, race, religion, intrapersonal factors
such as personality and mental health.
Bereavement of a close friend is a type of disenfranchised grief. It renders significant nega-
tive impact on people’s physical health, vitality, mental health, social functioning and role limi-
tations due to emotional problems. Drawing on the theory of psychological kinship we
demonstrated that bereaved females experience more negative and long-lasting bereavement
outcomes. Specifically, they experience a substantial fall in vitality, suffered more deterioration
in mental health, impaired role-emotional and social functioning than male counterparts for
up to four years. Our results showed that people who were not socially active suffered signifi-
cant adverse physical and psychological well-being, inferior mental health and social function-
ing. The death of a close friend reduced a person’s social network and interaction. For
respondents who were socially engaged, they received support from other friends and relatives
during bereavement, and thus the negative impact was somewhat moderated. Overall, we pre-
sented robust evidence that the death of a close friend matters. The findings have international
applicability regarding the impact of bereavement on close friends. The data suggest the need
to ensure services are able to assist people who have experienced the death of a friend to
develop support networks.
