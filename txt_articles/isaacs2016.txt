IMPORTANCE For early-stage breast cancer, breast conservation surgery (BCS) is a
conservative option for women and involves removing the tumor with a margin of
surrounding breast tissue. If margins are not tumor free, patients undergo additional surgery
to avoid local recurrence.
OBJECTIVES To investigate the use of BCS in New York State and to determine rates of
reoperation, procedure choice, and the effect of surgeon experience on the odds of a
reoperation 90 days after BCS.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A population-based sample of 89 448 women
undergoing primary BCS for cancer were selected and examined from January 1, 2003, to
December 31, 2013, in New York State mandatory reporting databases. All hospitals and
ambulatory surgery centers in New York State were included. Data were analyzed from
December 15, 2014, to November 1, 2015.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Rate of reoperations within 90 days of the initial BCS
procedure.
RESULTS During the study period, 89 448 women 20 years or older (mean [SD] age, 61.7
[13.7] years) underwent primary BCS. In 2013, 1416 women in New York aged 20 to 49 years
underwent BCS compared with 3068 women aged 50 to 64 years and 3644 women 65 years
or older. These numbers represent a significant decrease from 1960 women younger than 50
years in 2003 who underwent BCS (P < .001 for trend) but little change from the 2899
women aged 50 to 64 years and 3270 women 65 years or older who underwent BCS in 2003.
Mean overall rate of 90-day reoperation was 30.9% (27 010 of 87 499 patients) and
decreased over time from 39.5% (6630 of 16 805 patients) in 2003 to 2004 to 23.1% (5148
of 22 286 patients) in 2011 to 2013. Rates of reoperation were highest in women aged 20 to
49 years (37.7% [6990 of 18 524]) and lowest in women 65 years or older (26.3% [9656 of
36 691]) (P < .001 for trend). Over time, more patients underwent BCS as a subsequent
procedure, from 4237 of 6630 patients (63.9%) in 2003 to 2004 to 4258 of 5148 (82.7%) in
2011 to 2013 (P < .001 for trend). Among the 19 466 women who underwent BCS as a second
procedure, 2429 (12.5%) required a third intervention (2.7% of all women included).
Significant surgeon-level variation was found in the data; 90-day rates of reoperations by
surgeon ranged from 0% to 100%. Low-volume surgeons (<14 cases per year) had an
unadjusted rate of 35.2% compared with 29.6% in middle-volume (14-33 cases per year) and
27.5% in high-volume (�34 cases per year) surgeons. The difference persisted in adjusted
analyses (odds ratio for low-volume surgeons, 1.49 [95% CI, 1.19-1.87]; for middle-volume
surgeons, 1.20 [95% CI, 0.93-1.56]) compared with high-volume surgeons (used as the
reference category).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Use of BCS has decreased overall, most steeply in younger
women. Nearly 1 in 4 women underwent a reoperation within 90 days of BCS across New
York State from 2011 to 2013, compared with 2 in 5 from 2003 to 2004. Rates vary
significantly by surgeon, and initial BCS performed by high-volume surgeons was associated
with a 33% lower risk for a reoperation.

C
ancer of the female breast is the most common cancer
and the principal cause of cancer-related death among
women globally.1 In the United States, an estimated
232 670 new cases of breast cancer would be diagnosed in
2014.2 For early-stage breast cancer, the most common treat-
ments are mastectomy and breast conservation surgery (BCS)
both of which are usually combined with adjuvant radio-
therapy. Total mastectomy is a well-established treatment op-
tion with some cosmetic limitations that may influence the pa-
tient’
s quality of life.3 Breast conservation surgery is a
conservative option for women and involves removing the tu-
mor with a margin of surrounding tumor-free breast tissue.
Multiple randomized clinical trials comparing BCS with mas-
tectomy have reported similar survival with a slightly higher
risk for local recurrence compared with mastectomy.4-6 Breast
conservation surgery also may be associated with a more posi-
tive body image compared with mastectomy.3,7

forming an investigative study of the use of BCS in New York
State over time. We determine reoperation occurrence, the
choice of procedure for the reoperation, and the effect of phy-
sician experience and patient characteristics on the odds of re-
operation 90 days after BCS.
Methods
Sample Selection
The New York Statewide Planning and Cooperation System
(SPARCS) is a collection of patient-level details from every hos-
pital discharge and ambulatory surgery encounter in New York
State. Its current format contains patient demographics, di-
agnoses, procedures, and discharge status.24 All female pa-
tients 20 years or older who underwent BCS for breast cancer
as determined by codes from the Current Procedural Termi-
nology or the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Re-
vision(ICD-9),fromJanuary1,2003,toDecember31,2013,were
selected. These years were chosen to reflect modern practice
from available data at the time of analysis. Patients for whom
BCS was not the primary procedure, who were not residents
of New York State, who underwent BCS or mastectomy in the
year before the incident procedure, or who had a known per-
sonal history of breast cancer were excluded. This study was
approved by the institutional review board of Weill Cornell
Medical College. Informed consent was waived because data
were already collected for billing purposes.
Variables
Patient age and race, payer, and procedure setting were avail-
ableintheSPARCSdatabase.Patientfamilyhistoryofbreastcan-
cer, personal history of cancer, diagnosis of carcinoma in situ,
and the presence of coronary artery disease were determined
using ICD-9 coding algorithms (described in eTable 1 in the
Supplement). Additional comorbidities of cerebrovascular dis-
ease, hypertension, hypothyroidism, obesity, chronic pulmo-
nary disease, and depression were developed and validated
using the methods of Elixhauser et al25 for administrative data.
We also included a validated score created by van Walraven et
al26 using the published measures of Elixhauser et al25 to quan-
tify the overall comorbidity burden.
Surgeon Experience
The SPARCS data include the license number of the surgeon
who performed the primary procedure for each encounter,
which allowed us to calculate the mean annual volume of
BCS for each surgeon. Volume was broken into tertiles as sug-
gested by Birkmeyer and colleagues20 in their landmark sur-
geon volume outcome study. In addition, we looked up the
date of medical school graduation for each licensed surgeon
in the database of New York State Office of Professionals27 to
determine their years of experience. This linkage was pos-
sible for 75% of the available data. Surgeon experience was
also described in tertiles.
Key Points
Question: What patient- and surgeon-level variables have an
effect on rates of reoperations after breast conservation surgery
(BCS) in New York State?
Findings: Among 89 448 women 20 years or older who
underwent primary BCS for cancer from 2003 to 2013, the
mean rate of reoperations within 90 days was 30.9%. Rates
decreased over time and varied by surgeon, and BCS performed by
high-volume surgeons was associated with a 33% lower risk for a
reoperation.
Meaning: Nearly 1 in 4 women will undergo a repeated operation
90 days after BCS, but rates vary widely by surgeon.

Outcome
For each patient, we looked within 90 days of the incident BCS
forarepeatedBCSoramastectomy.Becauselateralitywaspro-
vided on 26.6% of cases only, we did not consider any mis-
matched cases to be reoperations for patients for whom lat-
erality was coded on the incident procedure and the
reoperation. This mismatch only occurred in 0.16% of pa-
tients. We then repeated the method to look for a third exci-
sion surgery within 90 days of the second BCS.
Statistical Analysis
Data were analyzed from December 15, 2014, to November 1,
2015. Raw counts, percentages, and means and SDs were pre-
sented for descriptive analyses. We examined changes over
time and by patient age graphically and verified these data
using Cochran-Armitage tests. For adjusted odds of reopera-
tion within 90 days, we used hierarchical logistic regression
models. Models were fit using adaptive quadrature in the gen-
eralized linear mixed model (GLIMMIX) procedure with a ran-
dom physician-level intercept to account for clustering of pa-
tients within surgeons. Unadjusted and multivariable models
are presented for each patient and physician factor. We used
χ2 tests to examine factors associated with the choice of the
repeated procedure, and all P values are 2-sided. To examine
variation in physician reintervention rates, we used funnel
plots. A small amount (<5%) of data were missing in hospital
volume and payer variables, and a relatively large amount of
data was missing for surgeon experience. Missing values were
excluded in pairwise univariate analyses, and all cases with
missingdatawereexcludedfromthemultivariablemodel.Sen-
sitivityanalyseswereperformedforexcludingcaseswithmiss-
ing data from all analyses, which yielded similar estimates. All
analyses were completed using SAS software (version 9.3; SAS
Institute Inc).
Results
From January 1, 2003, to December 31, 2013, 89 448 women
20 years or older underwent primary BCS for breast cancer
across New York State (eFigure in the Supplement). The mean
(SD) age was 61.7 (13.7) years, with 37 581 women (42.0%) 65
years or older and 18 857 women (21.1%) aged 20 to 49 years.
Most patients were white (65 208 [75.5%]), had commercial in-
surance (44 837 [50.2%]), and underwent surgery in an out-
patient setting (80 970 [90.5%]) (Table 1).
The use of BCS in New York State has changed over time.
Use appeared to have peaked in 2004 with more than 8500
cases and decreased to a mean of 8078 in 2011 to 2013. In 2003,
1960 women with breast cancer aged 20 to 49 years, 2899 aged
50 to 64 years, and 3270 65 years or older underwent BCS. Al-
though the use varied slightly over time for women 50 to 65
yearsand65yearsorolder,itdecreasedsignificantlyinwomen
aged 20 to 49 years (P < .001 for trend), so that in 2013 only
1416 underwent BCS (compared with 3068 aged 50-64 years
and 3644 65 years or older) (Figure 1).
Owing to insufficient follow-up among patients undergo-
ing BCS after October 1, 2013, 87 499 patients contributed to
the 90-day analysis of reoperation rates. The mean 90-day re-
operation rate was 30.9% (27 010 of 87 499 patients) for the
entirestudyperiodanddecreasedsignificantlyovertime,from
39.5% (6630 of 16 805 patients) in 2003 to 2004 to 23.1% (5148
of 22 286 patients) in 2011 to 2013 (P < .001 for trend)

(Figure 2A). Reoperation rates were highest in women aged 20
to 49 years (37.7% [6990 of 18 524]) and lowest in the women
65 years or older (26.3% [9656 of 36 691]) (P < .001 for trend)
(Figure 2B).
Over time, more patients underwent BCS as a repeated
procedure, from 4237 of 6630 patients (63.9%) in 2003 to
2004 to 4258 of 5148 patients (82.7%) in 2011 to 2013
(P < .001 for trend) (Figure 2C). The women aged 50 to 64
years were more likely to undergo BCS than mastectomy as a
repeated procedure (7714 of 10 364 [74.4%]) compared with
patients aged 20 to 49 years (4860 of 6990 [69.5%]) and 65
years or older (71.4%) (P = .054 for trend) (Figure 2D).
Women who were white (13 900 of 18 909 [73.5%] vs 5009
of 7206 [69.5%]) and who had commercial insurance (10 985
of 19 466 [56.4%] vs 3895 of 7544 [51.7%]), low comorbidity
scores (4446 of 19 466 [22.8%] vs 1039 of 7544 [13.8%]), or in
situ disease (4193 of 19 466 [21.5%] vs 1430 of 7544 [19.0%])
were also more likely to undergo BCS than mastectomy as a
repeated procedure (eTable 2 in the Supplement). Of the
19 466 patients who underwent a second BCS, 2429 (12.5%)
required a third intervention (2.7% of women undergoing a
primary BCS).

We found a significant surgeon-level variation in the
data, with rates of reoperations varying from 0% to 100%.
Although the mean rate of reoperations was 30.8%, 454 of
2299 surgeons (19.7%) had rates higher than 50%. Of the
2299 surgeons who performed at least 1 primary BCS, 299
(13.0%) had reoperation rates above the 95% confidence
limits for reoperation, including 140 surgeons (6.1%) above
the 99.8% limits. On the other side, 139 surgeons (6.0%) had
reoperation rates below the 95% confidence limits, and 67
(2.9%) had reoperation rates below the 99.8% limits
(Figure 3).
Most surgeons (2087 of 2299 [90.8%]) performed a mean
oflessthan14primarycasesperyear,whereasarelativelysmall
percentage of surgeons (56 of 2299 [2.4%]) performed a mean
of more than 33 cases per year, which accounts for 33.1% of
women treated. Surgeons who performed less than 14 BCS pro-
cedureshadameanunadjustedreoperationrateof35.2%com-
pared with 29.6% in surgeons performing 14 to 33 BCS proce-
dures and 27.5% in surgeons performing 34 or more BCS
procedures.Highervolumewasindependentlyassociatedwith
reoperation rates, and the difference persisted in multivari-
able analyses (odds ratio [OR] for low volume, 1.49 [95% CI,
1.19-1. 87]; for middle volume, 1.20 [95% CI, 0.93-1.56]). Time
since medical school graduation (duration of career) was as-
sociated with reoperation, but the difference disappeared af-
ter adjusting for surgeon volume and other patient factors
(Table 2).
In adjusted analyses, only being younger than 65 years
(OR for <50 years, 1.47 [95% CI, 1.37-1.58]; for 50-64 years,
1.21 [95% CI, 1.13-1.29]), nonwhite race (OR for black race,
1.07 [95% CI, 1.00-1.15]; for other race, 1.13 [95% CI, 1.05-
1.20]), and carcinoma in situ (OR, 1.57 [95% CI, 1.49-1.65])
were associated with a higher risk for reoperation. Patients
who did not have a high comorbidity score (OR for low
comorbidity score, 0.73 [95% CI, 0.68-0.77]; for a medium
comorbidity score, 0.78 [95% CI, 0.75-0.82]), who had non-
commercial insurance (OR for Medicaid, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.81-
0.95]; for Medicare, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.80-0.91]), and who had
inpatient procedures (OR, 0.36 [95% CI, 0.33-0.39]) were
less likely to undergo a repeated excision.
Discussion
In this study, we found a steady decrease in rates of reopera-
tion over time; however, nearly 1 in 4 women still underwent
at least 1 additional surgical procedure for breast cancer. Fur-
ther, we found that individual surgeons’reoperation rates var-
ied widely, and many surgeons had rates much higher or lower
than expected. Finally, we documented a clear surgeon vol-
ume-outcome effect and increasing changes in selecting BCS
as a reoperation procedure.
To our knowledge, this study is the first to examine reop-
eration rates in the Unites States at a population level using a
cohort that includes certified and noncertified cancer cen-
ters. The reoperation rates found in this study are consistent
with those reported by Jeevan and colleagues,28 who found
that nearly 1 in 5 women underwent a second operation after
BCS in the UK National Health Service. Wilke and colleagues19
examined the US National Cancer Database from 2004 to 2010
andfoundameanreoperationrateof23.6%inthecountry,with
a small decrease in rates over time (2.5% for noninvasive and
2.2%forinvasivecancers).Theyalsoobservedadecreasedrate
of reoperations with increased patient age, which is aligned
with our results.19 We believe that the findings of reduced oc-
currence of reoperations are encouraging and imply improve-
ments in training and patient selection for BCS.
The reduction in the use of BCS as a primary cancer treat-
ment corresponds to an increase in mastectomy rates during
the last decade, especially among women younger than 50
years.29 Further, an increasing incidence in the United States
of bilateral mastectomy, particularly contralateral prophylac-
tic mastectomies, occurred during the same period as our
study.30-32 The reduction in the use of BCS in women younger
than 50 years and a corresponding reduction in overall reop-
eration rates over time implies that surgeons may be select-
ing more appropriate patients for the procedures.
Fisher and colleagues33 also noted rising mastectomy rates
and confirmed in a survey of 332 mastectomy recipients from
2006 to 2010 that fear of cancer recurrence was the biggest
motivator for declining BCS. In addition, they found no

difference in the reported reasons by age group. Addressing
the motivations of the women who undergo BCS is beyond the
scope of this study.
Our finding related to the effect of surgeon volume on re-
operation is novel and unprecedented. Limited prior evidence
on the topic was not conclusive. Lovrics and colleagues34 re-
viewed489patientsreferredforradiotherapyinHamilton,On-
tario, Canada, for predictors of positive margins after BCS and
found that surgeons with higher volumes resected a larger
amount of tissue and had lower rates of positive margins; how-
ever, these differences disappeared after case-mix adjust-
ment. McCahill and colleagues17 also considered surgeon vol-
umeintheirinvestigationofpredictorsofreexcisionswithin311
patients with positive postoperative margins and 1909 pa-
tients with negative postoperative margins and found no asso-
ciationineithergroup.Thesestudies,however,includedarela-

regional observational studies are the main tools for evalua-
tion of patient selection, practice, and physician patterns in
surgery,35 and our study is unique from this perspective. Fur-
thermore, the variation of reoperation rates from 0% to 100%
is stunning when we consider that about 20% of surgeons have

a reoperation rate of more than 50%. A large number of sur-
geons had much lower than expected rates of second opera-
tions, which also requires reflection and future research. Until
recently, no consensus existed about when to perform a reex-
cision related to the width of surgical margins.9,11,36 The Soci-
etyofSurgicalOncologyandAmericanSocietyforRadiationOn-
cology have now recommended that ink-positive margins on
invasivetumorsandcarcinomainsituundergoreexcision;how-
ever,patientswithnegativebutperceivedclosemarginsarenot
recommended for a second surgery.37 Assessment of how the
consensusstatementswillaffectreoperationsinthefuturemay
further reduce reoperation rates.
Our analysis of the effect of patient characteristics on re-
operation rates also updates the results of prior investiga-
tions. Aziz and colleagues11 investigated positive margin sta-
tus and reexcisions in 1430 women undergoing BCS from 1987
to 1997. They found that the odds of a positive margin were
inversely proportional to patient age and diagnosis of carci-
noma in situ. Wilke and colleagues19 also noted higher odds
of a repeated operation with younger age and black race. Other
studies investigating the role of race in breast cancer treat-
ments and outcomes, however, have found that the effect dis-
appears after adjusting for socioeconomic status,38,39 which
we have not been able to include in our model. The decrease
in reoperation rates with increased patient age and comorbid-
ity may indicate that surgeons remove more tissue during an
initial BCS to avoid a reoperation in higher-risk patients.

geonsindicatesaneedforprofessionalsocietiestoprovideguide-

patient-reported outcomes data.
A major limitation of this study is that tumor size, grade,
and staging are unavailable in this data source, and therefore
we could not adjust for these variables. These cancer vari-
ables have been shown in other studies17-19 to have an impor-
tant influence on positive margin rates and reoperation rates
after BCS. Furthermore, pathologic information on positive
marginsandotherclinicalfactors,suchasuseofmagneticreso-
nance imaging, breast size, and tumor location, is unavail-
able.Webelieve,however,inthecontextofphysician-levelout-
comes, that these factors will not bias the results; the
recommendation for BCS will be made by surgeons based on
their knowledge of the patients’disease, and we have no rea-
son to believe that unknowable patient characteristics will be
unbalanced between surgeons. Lovrics and colleagues34 com-
paredthetumorcharacteristicsofpatientsundergoingBCSand

volume surgeons.
In addition to these limitations, this study does not mea-

Conclusions
Nearly 1 in 4 women underwent a reoperation within 90 days
of BCS across New York State from 2011 to 2013, which is re-
duced compared with 2 in 5 observed in 2003 to 2004. Reop-
eration rates vary significantly by surgeon from 0% to 100%,
and initial BCS procedures performed by low-volume sur-
geons were associated with a 50% higher risk for a reopera-
tion when compared with the highest-volume surgeons. Af-
terdevelopingguidelines,qualitymetricsneedtobedeveloped
and studies need to assess the effect of guidelines on rates of
reoperations after BCS.
