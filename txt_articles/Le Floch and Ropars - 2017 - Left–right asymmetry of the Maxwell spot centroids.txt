In human vision, the brain has to select one view of the world from our two
eyes. However, the existence of a clear anatomical asymmetry providing
an initial imbalance for normal neural development is still not understood.
Using a so-called foveascope, we found that for a cohort of 30 normal
adults, the two blue cone-free areas at the centre of the foveas are asymmetrical.
The noise-stimulated afterimage dominant eye introduced here corresponds to
the circular blue cone-free area, while the non-dominant eye corresponds to the
diffuse and irregular elliptical outline. By contrast, we found that this asym-
metry is absent or frustrated in a similar cohort of 30 adults with normal
ocular status, but with dyslexia, i.e. with visual and phonological deficits. In
this case, our results show that the two Maxwell centroid outlines are both cir-
cular but lead to an undetermined afterimage dominance with a coexistence of
primary and mirror images. The interplay between the lack of asymmetry and
the development in the neural maturation of the brain pathways suggests new
implications in both fundamental and biomedical sciences.
1. Introduction
Asymmetry is ubiquitous in living beings, including humans, at the molecular
and anatomical levels. Although apparently anatomically symmetrical, our
two eyes, which are strongly connected to the brain, exhibit rivalry and domi-
nance [1,2]. Besides the crucial role played by genetics and complex molecular
mechanisms [3–5], monocular deprivation has shown the importance of compe-
tition in the functional development of the complex nervous pathways and
synapses, especially during the critical period [1,3–5]. Among the different
sense inputs to the human brain, each optic nerve consists of 1.2 million fibres
[6], while each auditory nerve a mere 30 000. Deprivation has shown competi-
tion between the two eyes from birth [1]. During the so-called critical period,
which ends around 8 years of age, each eye sculpts its neural circuit to the
brain [3–5]. In normal binocular vision there is an inherent effect of parallax
and the brain has to select the eye which is primarily relied on for precise pos-
itional information, therefore requiring some hidden asymmetry between the
two eyes. The presence or the absence of an asymmetry should play a crucial
role in the nervous connectivity for both the visual and the phonological pro-
cesses in the different modal and cross-modal regions of the brain [7],
including from birth [8,9]. Indeed, visual and phonological deficits being
involved in dyslexia which affects at least 10% of any given population [10],
one may wonder about the role of such asymmetry in this disorder. To unveil
this asymmetry, we use here a combination of an afterimage eye dominance
determination, and a foveascope technique for a quantitative comparison of
the Maxwell spot centroid outlines of the two eyes.
As our two eyes are apparently symmetrical apart from some optical proper-
ties, let us concentrate our attention on the foveas from which approximately half
of the nerve fibres in the optic nerve carry information to the brain [11]. The

 arrangement of the photoreceptors on the retina [12] has not
the regularity of the pixel spacing of a computer screen. How-
ever, they are well aligned with each other on the fovea [13,14].
Moreover, the blue cones play an intriguing role especially in
the fovea with their unique distribution and specificity [15].
They are found only outside the fovea centralis [11,16] whereas
the green and red cones are concentrated inside (figure 1a), and
an anatomically distinct pathway conveys their signals to the
brain [18]. The blue cones have a peak spectral sensitivity
well separated (by about 100 nm) from those of the green
and red cones. Owing to chromatic dispersion (figure 1a), to
preserve the eye acuity in this highly dense receptor area, the
human eye has evolved towards a blue cone-free zone of
about 100–150 mm in diameter in the cone mosaic of
figure 1a, which corresponds to the Maxwell spot centroid.
Note that, while for the whole Maxwell spot [19] with an over-
all 1 mm diameter, the macular pigment plays a role, for the
small spot centroid the pigment is unable to account for the
foveal blue scotoma [20,21,22] which appears as a tiny dark
spot (figure 1b). The direct observation of the blue cones
using anti-blue opsin [16] has unambiguously confirmed the
existence of the blue cone-free area at the centre of each
fovea, but the analysis has to be made post-mortem. Unfortu-
nately, owing to splitting and swelling in the tissues, a
comparison of the outline of the right and left blue cone-free
areas for a given subject is then out of reach. We have chosen
to build the so-called foveascope to perform a quantitative
comparison of the two Maxwell spot centroids of any observer,

 including their possible anomalies. We restrict our observation
to the centroids where the density of cones and the acuity are
the highest [11].
To investigate the presence or the absence of an asymmetry
of the blue cone-free areas and a possible link between this
asymmetry and the afterimage dominance, we first test a
cohort of 30 healthy students. Second, we perform the same
tests with a cohort of 30 students with dyslexia, this deficit
being characterized by a weaker brain lateralization [23,24].
The preferential use of one eye for visual functions has been
debated for a long time. To avoid different sighting artefact,
we revisit the ocular dominance by introducing a new
method based on the noise-stimulated negative afterimages
seen by the brain with the eyes closed.
2. Material and methods
(a) Observers
We tested a first cohort of 30 healthy students from our university
with normal binocular vision and no neurological disease (19
males and 11 females). We performed the same tests with a
second cohort of 30 students with similar visual status and optical
capabilities as the first cohort, but suffering from dyslexia, i.e. with
reading difficulties. All dyslexic students had reading performance
significantly poorer than expected, and were assessed by their own
optometrist to exclude ocular pathology. Subjects were aware
of the purpose of the study, but were not told what particular
manipulations were made for each trial. Informed consent was
obtained from each participant after the explanation of the
nature of the study (see the video in the electronic supplementary
material). During the academic year, the dyslexic volunteer stu-
dents (12 males and 18 females), examined by the medical staff
of the university, were assisted by the health centre of the univer-
sity which provided extra-time for the examinations. The degree
of impairment between these students varies, but all encountered
difficulties in reading, spelling, writing and recognizing left from
right. All these students benefit from 30% of extra time for their
academic examinations. The entire investigation process was
conducted according to the principles expressed in the Declaration
of Helsinki.
(b) Foveascope
When an observer looks at a bright white screen through a blue
filter, the blue cone-free area at the centre of the fovea is seen as
a dark zone on a blue background (figure 1b,c). For the screen
illumination, we use an ACER P1173 projector with a brightness
of 3000 lumens. The typical usual fading time of the associated
entoptic image is about a few seconds owing to the bleaching of
the photoreceptors and the neural adaptation. We have optimized
the contrast of the Maxwell centroid entoptic image by using a blue-
green exchange filter. The fading time can then be opposed by a
periodic shift of this blue-green exchange filter. Through the
green filter, the blue cone-free area is seen as a lighter green zone
on a dark green background (figure 1c). The transmittance of the
filters, with 40 nm bandwidths, centred at 460 nm and 535 nm in
the blue and the green respectively, is chosen at 16% for the blue
filter and 4% for the green filter, leading to a contrasted dark
entoptic image (figure 1b). Each observer adjusts the modulation
frequency between 0.1 to 1 Hz to his best convenience (typically
about 0.2 Hz). For each eye, the observer draws the outline of the
blue cone-free area by directly superposing the entoptic and the
real image projected on the screen (red line in figure 1b). Moreover,
by comparing the entoptic imagesto auxiliary calibrated circles also
projected on the screen, the angular diameter of the blue cone-free
area can be measured. To quantify a possible asymmetry of the two
cone-free area outlines, we introduce an osculating ellipse for each
eye centroid, and define the ellipticity 1R and 1L for the right and the
left eye respectively, as defined in figure 1d.
(c) Noise-stimulated negative afterimage dominance
Different sighting and sensory methods have been proposed,
namely in the last century, to determine the eye preference for an
observer. In a first step, we perform the Miles test and the hole-
in-the card test reviewed in references [25,26]. However, although
there was good test–retest reliability for the two ocular tests, arte-
facts exist such as the distance of observations or the gaze angle. To
avoid any visual artefact, we introduce here a noise-stimulated
afterimage method, where the two eyes remain closed after a fix-
ation by the two eyes on a same bright stimulus, i.e. an external
object with excellent light reflecting abilities. The observer can
look, for instance, at a contrasted window located at about 20 m
from the observer (figure 2a), or at a black letter like ‘b’ on a
bright screen (figure 6). With his two eyes, the observer gazes at
the fixation point schematized by the cross, for a short duration
of about 5–15 s according to the light luminance, so as to avoid
a too strong saturation of the retina receptors. Then he closes his
eyes. The receptors of his two retinas are then equally imprinted.
In usual afterimage experiments, when the two eyes are closed
after the fixation, the negative afterimage fades in about 6 to 8 s.
Moreover, the contribution of each eye to the activation of the after-
image cannot be isolated. However as the neuron responses are
nonlinear and exhibit the bistability of resting and spiking states,
an external noise is known to enhance the signals of such nonlinear
systems [27–29]. For the retinal neurons, the external noise can be
provided by the weak diffused light passing through the closed
eyelids. So, blocking in a first step the 2 to 3% of the diffused
light passing through the eyelids with the hands [30], and then
modulating this noise by alternatively shifting the hands in front
of each eye, with a periodicity of about 2 s, two noise activations
of the afterimage are seen successively for each eye (see the
video in the electronic supplementary material). Hence, we have
a differential method for comparing the activation in the brain of
the same information encoded in the retinas which is part of the
central nervous system. The fading time of these activated afteri-
mages is extended to tens of seconds when the successive
activations through the eyelids byshifting the hands are continued,
and a direct comparison of the luminance and quality of the two
activated afterimages is clearly obtained for a given stimulus
(figure 2a,b). Note that in a variant of the method, monocular
vision can be used successively for each eye, leading to the same
results, thus avoiding any possible binocular fusion problem in
the afterimage dominance determination (see the video in the elec-
tronic supplementary material). Moreover, as we shall see below,
these afterimages appear to be a powerful tool for investigating
the consequences of the lack of asymmetry of the foveas in dyslexia,
namely in confirming that both an image and its mirror-image
can really coexist for dyslexics. For the two cohorts, we will
compare the results of the afterimage method with those obtained
by the usual sighting methods to determine the ocular dominance.
3. Results
(a) Normal observers
(i) Afterimage dominance
The afterimage tests were performed using the stimulus of
figure 2a. Typical reconstructions of the observed activated
afterimages for each eye are shown in figure 2a,b for two
normal observers. For the first observer no. 5 (figure 2a), the
afterimage is brighter for the right eye than that for the left
eye, while the afterimage brightnesses are interchanged for
the second observer no. 17 (figure 2b). The results for the

 whole cohort are shown in the right column of figure 2c. In par-
allel, the observers have tested their ocular dominance using
the Miles and the hole-in-the card tests. The results are
shown in the left column of figure 2c. For the cohort of 30
normal observers, the sighting tests determine the eye domi-
nance for 28 observers (figure 2). Only two observers (nos 19
and 22) have no eye dominance, owing to gaze incidence pro-
blems. The afterimage method confirms the eye preference of
the 28 observers, and determines also the eye dominance of
the observers nos 19 and 22. Hence, in absence of any visual
artefact, the noise-stimulated afterimage method unambigu-
ously determines the eye dominance for the whole cohort.
Sixty-three per cent of the students were right-eyed dominant,
while 36% were left-eyed dominant (represented in orange and
purple respectively in figure 2c). These results are robust and
generally confirm the usual sighting tests. Moreover, note
that the afterimage test clearly suggests that the neural connec-
tions of one retina to the brain are stronger than those from the
other retina. The level of significance of the dominance is
reinforced by earlier measurement of the shorter reaction
time of the dominant eye [31] and by functional magnetic res-
onance imaging where the dominant eye activates a larger area
and a higher signal of the primary visual cortex than the non-
dominant eye [32]. However, the basic question of the origin of
the ocular dominance remains to be answered. To look for a
possible link with a potential asymmetry of the blue cone-
free areas, we investigated the Maxwell centroid outlines of
the whole cohort of 30 healthy students.

 (ii) Maxwell’s spot centroids asymmetry
The recording of the outlines of the Maxwell centroids using the
foveascope is performed by each normal observer of the cohort,
independently of the afterimage dominance test. The typical
results for the outline measurements of the Maxwell centroids
are shown in figure 3a for the right-eyed observer no. 5 and in
figure 3b for the left-eyed observer no. 17. The asymmetry
between the two outlines for each observer is clear and quanti-
fied by the coefficient of asymmetry D1 ¼ 1R2 1L. The main
results for the whole cohort of the normal observers shown in
figure 3c are: first, the existence of an asymmetry for all obser-
vers, and second, a reversed sign of the coefficient of
asymmetry between the right and left-eyed groups. For the
right-eyed observers, the coefficient of asymmetry is systemati-
cally positive, with a mean value kD1l ¼ þ0.42, while for the
left-eyed observers, the asymmetry coefficient is negative with
a mean value kD1l ¼ 20.47. The mean angular diameter of
the centroids for the observers is k2al ¼ 270 +30 and there is
no preferred azimuth w (figure 1d) for the elliptical outline.
Moreover, the dominant eye with its stronger connectivity to
the brain is likely to be determined by the circular outline
centred on the decussation line (figure 1a), and the non-domi-
nant eye by the elliptical and somewhat irregular outline. The
asymmetry coefficient corresponding to two different topo-
graphies of the blue cones, varies from jD1j ¼ 0.3 (weak
asymmetry) to jD1j ¼ 0.6 (strong asymmetry), but the corre-
lation between the blue cone-free area asymmetry and the
afterimage dominance is perfect for the 30 students.
(b) Dyslexic observers
(i) Afterimage dominance
Figure 4a shows the observations with the afterimage test, for
the observer no. 15. The two eyes show two identical activated
afterimages for this observer. Such undefined afterimage dom-
inance is seen for 27 observers of the cohort (figure 4b). As for
the cohort of normal observers, we have investigated the ocular
dominance of the cohort of students with dyslexia, using the
Miles and hole-in-the-card tests. The results reported in the
left column of figure 4b show that the sighting tests gave

 more difficulties than for the cohort of normal observers.
Indeed, for 14 observers, the sighting tests give an apparent
dominance probably linked to the gaze of incidence. The
results can vary throughout the day or from day to day.
For these 14 observers the difficulties vanish with the after-
image test (see the right column in figure 3b). For the other
16 observers, noted by the dotted lines, the two methods
give identical results. For 13 of these observers, no ocular dom-
inance exists. However, three students in the cohort (nos 6, 12,
28) have a dominant eye both with the sighting tests and the
afterimage test. These particular cases are discussed below.
Finally 27 observers in the whole cohort of students with
dyslexia exhibit an undetermined afterimage dominance.
(ii) Maxwell’s spot centroid asymmetry
Let us investigate the centroid outlines for these 27 dyslexic stu-
dents without any ocular dominance and for the three special
cases. For the observer no. 15 for instance, the two outlines rep-
resented in figure 5a show a lack of asymmetry 1R ≃ 1L ≃ 1 .

with their possible artefacts, give an apparent dominance. In short, for this cohort, all observers show an undetermined afterimage dominance, apart from observer
nos 6, 12 and 28 who have a robust dominance with both the sighting and afterimage tests (see figure 5b and the text).

 dominance (figure 5b). However, the mean angular diameter
k2al for this cohort is similar to that in the controls. Surprisingly,
the three students (nos 6, 12, 28) with an afterimage dominant
eye have a clear asymmetry of their outlines (figure 5), compar-
able to that of the controls. However, by contrast, here their
dominant eye corresponds to the elliptical outline and not to
the circular one, which was the case for the cohort of normal
observers. In fact, these three students (nos 6, 12, 28) have had
a ‘frustrated’ dominance since their birth owing to strabismus,
severe amblyopia, and facial malformations respectively, unfor-
tunately affecting their eye with the circular outline. So, apart for
the three students with frustrated afterimage dominance, for all
the students with dyslexia, the undefined afterimage dominance
exists and is correlated with the lack of asymmetry (figure 5b).
(iii) Coexistence of primary image and mirror image
The lack of asymmetry of the blue cone topographies described
above in the two eyes of dyslexics is likely to result in unex-
pected consequences. Dyslexics confuse left and right and
often make mirror errors in reading [33–38]. In particular
mirror-image letters along the vertical line, such as the ‘b’ and
the ‘d’, are often confused. The neurological basis of such
letter reversal remains unknown. Repeating the afterimage
test with the letter ‘b’ as a stimulus, for instance the observer
no. 29 with dyslexia sees a superposition of ‘b’ and ‘d’
(figures 5c and 6c). Surprisingly, in contrast to the case of a
normal observer (figure 6b), for this observer no. 29 the true
image ‘b’ and the mirror image ‘d’ coexist, explaining his
basic confusion and his basic reading difficulties. However,

 when the brain of the dyslexic reads the superposition of ‘b’
and ‘d’, a delay of about 5–10 ms exists for the arrival of the
mirror-image ‘d’ which has an extra-path through the corpus
callosum [33]. This small delay suggests the possibility of eras-
ing this secondary mirror-image ‘d’ using the critical temporal
window [39] for depressing the synapses producing the mirror
image, according to the Hebbian mechanism. We can exploit
this delay to achieve the mirror breaking, i.e. to suppress the
mirror image, as in normal observers. Indeed, for the dyslexic
observer no. 29, using a pulse-width-modulation light-emitting
diode taking advantage of the small delay, the afterimage test
directly shows that the spurious apparition of the mirror
image ‘d’ is actually cancelled (figure 6c). Interestingly, with
no visible flickering (above about 70 Hz), the normal reading
skills are restored for this observer, as for other observers
with dyslexia. For observers nos 3 and 16, the lateral shifts of
the different spurious mirror afterimages are larger (electronic
supplementary material, figure S1b) or more complex (elec-
tronic supplementary material, figure S1c), while for the
observers nos 22 and 24, other letters like c appear with their
mirror images at different locations (electronic supplementary
material, figures S2b and S2c).
(iv) Results for a whole family
The presence or absence of asymmetry in foveas at birth and
throughout development seems to play a pivotal role in the
neural connectivity of the brain for both cohorts. Family and
twin studies [40] have shown that genetics plays an important
role, inducing heritability of dyslexia [41]. However the link
between genes and phenotypes is particularly precarious in
complex disorders such as developmental dyslexia which corre-
spondsto a heterogeneous condition. Different researchers have
independently identified several susceptibility genes for dys-
lexia pointing towards molecular pathways affecting neuronal
migration and axonguidance[41]. We have had the opportunity
to test the asymmetry and the afterimage dominance in the
whole family of observer no. 29. The blue cone-free areas of
the five members medically detected with dyslexia are shown
in electronic supplementary material, figure S3. For all mem-
bers, no asymmetry is present, and the afterimage dominance
is undetermined, suggesting a genetic cause. The presence or
the absence of asymmetry of the two blue cone-free areas
seems a promising direction for trying to identify the related
genes in dyslexia. Families with affected and unaffected
members areperhapsthebest candidates for such investigations.
4. Discussion and conclusion
(a) Asymmetry, dominance and visual pathways
Hence, for normal observers, the two topographies of the blue
cones associated with the asymmetry of the outlines are differ-
ent for the two eyes and the distribution of the green and red
cones are also necessarily differently perturbed, namely at
the centre of the fovea. Consequently, the two retinal images
are therefore also slightly different. The more regular distri-
bution of photoreceptors on the fovea of the dominant eye
suggests a better retinal image quality for this eye. Moreover,
the circular blue cone-free area of the afterimage dominant
eye preserves its own symmetry in relation to the vertical
decussation line passing through its centre. Hence, the necess-
ary cementing of the nasal and temporal half-fields of the
retinas projected on the two hemispheres for each eye [42]
via the corpus callosum, is easier for the dominant eye. This
cementing is facilitated by the more similar receptive structures
associated with the two halves of the circular profiles separated
by the decussation line, then leading to a shorter reaction time
for the dominant eye as observed earlier [31]. More impor-
tantly, as the brain circuits are remodelled by use, owing to
synaptic plasticity, namely during their developmental critical
period (0–8 years), the asymmetry is also reinforced and
gradually transferred to the brain through the retinotopic
organization of the visual cortex [43]. A longitudinal study
has shown that the robustness of the dominance is also
increased during this period [44] where the asymmetry con-
tributes to the complex operations that assemble the cortical
circuits in the numerous areas of the brain and to the lateraliza-
tion, essential for reading [23,24,37]. Note that it is only at the
end of the developmental period of about 8 years, that the
child eye dominance is concomitantly stabilized with a
decrease of the mirror reversal errors [34].
For dyslexic students, their two eyes are equivalent and
their brain has to successively rely on the two slightly differ-
ent versions of a given visual scene, moreover often inducing
poor and unstable fixation [45]. The lack of asymmetry in

ous wave (CW lamp) to light the stimulus (top) and a pulse-width

observed by the dyslexic observer no. 29. While the control sees the expected
negative afterimage ‘b’ in the CW regime, surprisingly, in this regime, the
dyslexic student sees a superposition of the initial letter ‘b’ and also its
mirror image ‘d’ (top). Amazingly, using a pulse-width modulation light-
emitting diode (modulation frequency equal 70 Hz, duty cycle of 20%, no
visible flickering), the extra mirror-image ‘d’ is suppressed (bottom) and
the reading skills are restored. Similar results with spurious extra mirror-
images are shown for other students with dyslexia in the electronic
supplementary material, figures S1 and S2.

 dyslexics perturbs the complex connectivity and lateralization
of the different modal and cross-modal regions of the brain
involved in reading and other tasks. The retinal connectivity
[46], the organization [47] and the detailed topography [43] of
the primary cortex, along with the columnar architecture [48]
can be affected, but also numerous superior bundles such as
the corpus callosum [49], the magnocellular pathway [50],
and the left arcuate fasciculus where converging cross-
modal interaction of phonemes and graphemes is observed
[7]. A whole-brain functional connectivity analysis of dyslexia
[24] confirms that dyslexics show a decreased connectivity
along the visual pathway as well as between visual and pre-
frontal regions. The weak lateralization is confirmed by
functional transcranial Doppler ultrasound [23].
(b) Mirror-image confusion in dyslexia
Mirror-image confusion is common in many species such as
pigeons, dogs, monkeys [51,52]. The phenomenon is also
observed in humans, namely in young children and dyslexics
[34–38], although all with normal ocular status [53]. How-
ever, although the experimental tests have been performed
with several visual presentation conditions of stimulus, the
neural mechanisms remain largely unknown. The bilateral
symmetry of the nervous system with inter-hemispheric path-
ways linking homologue points are critical to mirror-image
confusion. Reading requires distinguishing mirror letters
such as ‘b’ and ‘d’. The asymmetry of the topographies of
the cones observed on the two foveas in a subject without
dyslexia, necessarily induces small differences between the
quality of the two retinal images and between the qualities
of the corresponding retinotopic maps of the visual cortex
hemispheres. Moreover, one can speculate that the secondary
mirror images resulting from the inter-hemispheric projec-
tions which are in competition with the primary images,
are necessarily slightly degraded owing to the asymmetry
and thus cancelled by the brain (figure 6b).
By contrast, for an observer with dyslexia, the Maxwell cen-
troids are both quasi circular and the two cone topographies are
more regular and similar, so that the primary and the mirror-
image can have the same quality and luminance. As shown in
figure 6, the mirror-image is not seen by the control, but is
seen for example by the observer no. 29 with dyslexia. The pri-
mary afterimage and the mirror-afterimage coexist for this
dyslexic (figure 6c), inducing confusion and affecting his
reading skills. The afterimages of electronic supplementary
material, figures S1b,c and S2b,c seen by other observers with
dyslexia (no. 3, no. 16, no. 22 and no. 24), show that the
mirror inter-hemispheric projections also exist for these obser-
vers, but can be slightly deviated and distorted for different
letters. Furthermore, as dyslexics are also confronted with
unstable binocular fixation [45], their observed afterimages
can be even more complex, as for example the triple ‘b’ seen
by observer no. 16 (electronic supplementary material, figure
S1c). For all these observers with dyslexia the pulse-width
modulation light-emitting diode, exploiting the small delay
between the primary and mirror images, erases the perturbing
extra-images at frequencies where no visible flickering occurs
(i.e. around 70 Hz) and restores the reading skills.
(c) Conclusion
The noise-induced negative afterimage method enables us to
determine the ocular dominance for an observer, which is cor-
related with the asymmetry of the outlines of the Maxwell spot
centroids. Beyond genetics, the asymmetry between the two
blue cone-free areas appearsto be a necessary and fundamental
condition for brain connectivity for a normal development. By
contrast, the lack of asymmetry might be the biological and
anatomical basis of reading and spelling disabilities in people
with a normal ocular status but with dyslexia, perturbing the
connectivity of different regions in the brain and inducing
the observed common visual and phonological difficulties
[54–56]. Our results suggest early anatomical diagnosis of dys-
lexia in young children and possible compensation for their
potential lack of asymmetry, especially during the critical
period. For adults, opportunities such as exploiting the small
delays in the brain connections by using pulse-width modu-
lation light-emitting diodes may provide novel strategies to
overcome reading and other neurological difficulties.
