metal-on-metal implant failure with cobalt
and chromium toxicity

Abstract
Background: There were at least 31,171 metal-on-metal (MoM) hip implants in the UK between 2003 and 2011.
Some of these were subject to failure and widescale recalls and revisions followed.
Method: This is a presentation of ten cases (mean age 60 years) where we evaluated neuropsychiatric morbidity
following metal-on-metal hip implant failure and revision. Implants were ASR total hip replacement (acetabular
implant, taper sleeve adaptor and unipolar femoral implants) performed between 2005 and 2009. This case series
describes, for the first time, neuropsychiatric complications after revision where there has been cobalt and
chromium toxicity.
Results: Pre-revision surgery, nine patients had toxic levels of chromium and cobalt (mean level chromium
338 nmol/l, mean cobalt 669.4 nmol/l). Depression assessment showed 9 of 9 respondents fulfilled the BDI criteria
for depression and 3 of these were being treated. 7 of 9 patients showing short term memory deficit with mean
mini mental state examination score of 24.2. The normal population mean MMSE for this group would be expected
to be 28 with <25 indicating possible dementia.
Conclusions: We found neurocognitive and depressive deficits after cobalt and chromium metallosis following
MoM implant failure. Larger studies of neurocognitive effects are indicated in this group. There may be implications
for public health.

Background
Metal-on-metal (MoM) hip implants are used in total hip
replacement surgeries and hip resurfacing procedures.
These implants have both the ball and socket components
made of metal. They have been extensively used. The
National Registry for Hip Implants in England and Wales
recorded 402,051 primary hip implants between 2003 and
2011, of which 31,171 were stemmed metal-on-metal
(MoM) hip implants [30]. There have been high failure
rates associated with these hip implants: 5-year revision
rates in women aged 55 were 8.3% [30]. Regulators includ-
ing the US Food and Drug Administration, Health Canada
and the Therapeutic Goods Administration of Australia
have raised concerns about the safety of MoM implants
[32]. We looked at the psychiatric impact of these failures
in a case series.
After MoM hip resurfacing, higher cobalt and chromium
concentrations in blood have been associated with struc-
tural changes in visual neurological pathways ([12] study of
29 patients, mean age 59 years). There are reports of
metallosis following MoM hip implant failure, but little is
known about the specific impacts of chromium and cobalt
metallosis from these implants. Cobalt toxicity has been
known to follow some arthroplasties since the 1970s [19].
Neurological problems including changes in brain
structure and function have been reported following
MoM hip resurfacing and higher chromium/cobalt levels
[12, 27]. To the best of our knowledge psychiatric
symptoms following MoM implants have never previ-
ously been described. Herein we present an initial

 investigation into the neuropsychiatric and cognitive
function of patients that had MoM hip implants and re-
quired subsequent revision surgery.
Chromium is an essential trace nutrient derived
from rocks that exists in various chemical states [20].
Chromium exposure via the respiratory tract is an oc-
cupational hazard: acute chromium toxicity symptoms
include skin and respiratory tract inflammation, gastro-
intestinal upset and coma, and, less frequently, renal
failure,
hepatic
impairment,
cardiovascular
events,
haematological effects, teratogenicity and carcinogen-
icity [5]. Chromium is excreted in bile and urine with
little organ retention. In the blood it is divided evenly
between plasma and erythrocytes and in the absence
of any known exposure, whole blood chromium con-
centrations in the absence of any known exposure
range from 2.0 μg/100 mL to 3.0 μg/100 mL [5].
Cobalt is commonplace in the environment and has
over 28 isotopes, some of which are radioactive. Cobalt
is a component of cyanocobalamin (vitamin B12) and is
widely consumed with an estimated US daily intake of
11 μg/day [6]. Exposure to airborne cobalt causes re-
spiratory symptoms. Animal and human studies have
shown toxicity can arise in all major organ systems with
exposure to non-radioactive cobalt [1, 6, 26].
Some papers report the physical effects of metallosis
following MoM implants [2, 10, 11, 14, 24, 28, 29]. To
the best of our knowledge there are no papers specific-
ally describing psychiatric symptoms following MoM im-
plants, but there is a case report indicating neurological
problems associated with cobalt and chromium toxicity
[27]. Mao and colleagues reported two cases [24]. In one
of two published cases of MoM metallosis following
ASR hip replacements, Mao et al. [24] showed serum co-
balt levels of 410 nmol/l (quoted reference range 0–20)
and a serum chromium level of 240 nmol/l (0–100).
Concentrations of cobalt and chromium in the joint
fluid were 4218 nmol/l and 217 000 nmol/l respectively
[9]. Symptoms included appetite and weight loss, de-
pression, cognitive impairment, low energy and metallic
taste. Cobalt and chromium levels normalised after
revision surgery and symptoms cleared
Methods
We investigated ten patients who had received MoM hip
implants between 2005 and 2009, and who were con-
secutive referrals for psychiatric opinion following hip
implants in the Merseyside area. Patients were not pri-
marily referred because they had an identified affective
psychological reaction, or a cognitive deficit, but rather
for assessment of their potential psychological response
to revision surgery. All ten patients had revision surgery
between 2008 and 2012 and were psychiatrically assessed
in 2014/15. These implants all involved ASR total hip
replacement (acetabular implant, taper sleeve adaptor
and unipolar femoral implants).
A consultant psychiatrist (BG) took a comprehensive
psychiatric patient history as outlined in standard text-
books (e.g., [18]). The histories were written up and col-
lected into a qualtitative description of typical clinical
features in the series e.g., the presence or absence of
various psychiatric diagnoses framed according to a
standard diagnostic system, i.e., the fifth version of the
Diagnostic Statistical Manual - DSM 5 [7].
We assessed participant cognition using the Mini
Mental State Examination developed by Folstein et al.
[16]. The MMSE gives a maximum score of 30, with the
general population having a fairly high score of 28, dip-
ping among those older than 85. It is not used to diag-
nose psychiatric illness, but can be administered quickly
at the bedside by any clinician [15]. A score 25 or less in
patients aged over 65 indicates cognitive impairment
that should be investigated further [3, 25]. Scores can be
affected by age, culture, and education [31].
We assessed participant mood with the Beck Depression
Inventory (BDI-II) [8] and by psychiatric interview with a
diagnosis of depression according to DSM-5 criteria. Par-
ticipants were diagnosed with depression if they had a
BDI score above 12 [22]. As a benchmark, in one study
500–750 Australian adults with a mean age of 41 had a
mean BDI (composite) score of 12.4 [13]. We analysed the
sample prevalence of depressive disorder against the
prevalence of depression found in Liverpool in the 2001
ODIN study, as Liverpool was the nearest city to the sam-
ple population [4].
Our threshold for abnormal neurocognitive function
was based on the fact that the mean age of this sam-
ple was 60.5 years and that an MMSE of score 25 or
less in patients aged over 65 is a general indication of
cognitive
impairment
that
should
be
investigated
further [3, 25].
When
patients were psychiatrically
assessed
their
mean age was 60.5 years (range 46–71). Six were female
and four male. The mean age when implants had been
inserted was 52.5 years (range 38–63). The implants
were in situ for a mean of 4.44 years (range 2–7).
Results
Observed metallosis
We obtained data from standard clinical blood investiga-
tions (pre-revision surgery) including levels of cobalt
and chromium for all but one of the ten patients. These
nine patients had toxic levels of chromium (mean level
pre-revision surgery was 338 nmol/l, range 144–664,
acceptable levels being <134.5 [23]) and toxic levels of
cobalt (mean level pre-revision surgery 669.4 nmol/l,
range 184–2470, acceptable levels being <119 [23]).

 We only had post revision surgery chromium and cobalt
levels for three patients. Of these, two patients had non-
toxic chrome and cobalt levels, but one had sub-toxic
levels of cobalt (33) and toxic levels of chromium (173).
No patient reported a metallic taste in their mouth.
Observed mood and cognitive function
We found significantly depressed mood in the nine pa-
tients for who responded to the BDI questionnaire
(mean BDI score 27.6). This mean score would be con-
sistent with moderately severe depression [8].
We found neurocognitive abnormalities with mean
MMSE score of 24.2 across the whole series, with short-
term memory deficit in seven out of 10 patients. Other
abnormalities included disorientation in place, problems
with tests of concentration and word finding difficulties.
Two patients had a family history of senile dementia in a
first-degree relative. One patient had hypertension and
was receiving treatment.
To gain an idea of whether such levels of cognitive
function were unexpectedly low in this sample we ana-
lysed the sample’s prevalence of neurocognitive deficit
against the prevalence of early onset dementia in the
population. The best estimate of the prevalence of
early onset dementia was between 81 and 113 cases
per 100 000 for 45–64-year-olds (i.e., 0.00081–0.00113%)
[21]. We observed neurocognitive deficit in seven patients
(70%). Using the binomial distribution and an upper
bound probability from Lambert et al. of 0.00113, observ-
ing seven patients with a deficit from a sample of ten is
extremely improbable (p < 2.82e-19).
We also analysed the sample prevalence of depressive
disorder against the prevalence of depression found in
Liverpool, UK in the 2001 ODIN study, which was 7.8%
(3.3–17.5 95% CI) amongst adults aged 18–64 years
(Ayuso-Mateos 2001). We observed three patients being
treated for depression. Using the binomial distribution
and a probability from Ayuso-Mateos of 0.078, observing
three depressed patients in our sample would only be
expected about three times in 100 (p < 0.025). All nine
patients who completed a BDI survey exceeded the
depression threshold of 12, which even if we use the
upper confidence interval of 17.5% from Ayuso-Mateos
has p < 1.54e-07.
The patient with the highest pre-revision surgery levels
of chromium (664 nmol/l) and cobalt (2470 nmol/l) had
the lowest MMSE score at assessment.
Patient vignettes
We now describe typical presentations from four patients:
Ms. X had a right sided ASR total hip replacement -
acetabular implant, taper sleeve adaptor and unipolar
femoral implant when she was 58 and required
revision surgery four years later. She had pre-revision
chrome levels of 213 nmol/l and cobalt levels of
249 nmol/l. She was left with persistent anxieties
about the need for future surgery and a feeling she
must always be cautious about protecting her hip,
tearfulness, lability of mood, lowered self esteem – “I
used to be very active and now I feel a mess”, guilt
about being a burden on her husband, a fear about
the effects of ions on her body and poor concentration.
She had no cognitive abnormalities and a MMSE score
of 30, but had a significantly elevated Beck Depression
Inventory Score of 33, after treatment with fluoxetine.
Mr. Y had a left sided ASR total hip replacement -
acetabular implant, taper sleeve adaptor and unipolar
femoral implant when he was 52 and required revision
surgery six years later. He had pre-revision chrome
levels of 152 nmol/l and cobalt levels of 262 nmol/l.
He complained of chronic pain, loss of his occupation,
low mood, social withdrawal, poor sleep, poor
concentration, short term memory loss noted by
relatives, misplacing items round the house, increased
irritability, and absent libido. At age 58 he had cognitive
abnormalities and a MMSE score of 26, and a
significantly elevated Beck Depression Inventory
Score of 30 after treatment with dosulepin.
Mrs. Z had a right sided ASR total hip replacement -
acetabular implant, taper sleeve adaptor and unipolar
femoral implant when she was 51 and had revision
surgery seven years later. She had pre-revision chrome
levels of 326 nmol/l and cobalt levels of 544 nmol/l.
She complained of poor sleep with early morning
wakening, low mood and emotional lability, social
withdrawal, poor appetite, forgetfulness and a
tendency to repeat herself reported by relatives, her
frustration at being unable to do day to day activities
such as cleaning, she felt she was a burden to relatives,
and complained of anhedonia. She was disorientated in
person, was unable to perform serial sevens and was
able to register, but not able to retain any elements of a
new name and address on cognitive testing. At age 62
she had cognitive abnormalities and a MMSE score
of 17, and a significantly elevated Beck Depression
Inventory Score of 38 after treatment with escitalopram.
Mrs. A had a right sided ASR total hip replacement -
acetabular implant, taper sleeve adaptor and unipolar
femoral implant when she was 50 and had revision
surgery five years later. She had pre-revision chrome
levels of 664 nmol/l and cobalt levels of 2470 nmol/l.
She complained of missing her previous occupation,
chronic pain, low mood, low self confidence, poor
sleep with early morning wakening, poor appetite,

 forgetfulness with difficulty recalling words, difficulty
recalling conversations, social withdrawal, anhedonia,
and worry about the need for any further surgery. Her
concentration was poor, she was unable to subtract
serial sevens or spell the word ‘world’ backwards. At
age 57 she had cognitive abnormalities and a MMSE
score of 18, and a significantly elevated Beck Depression
Inventory Score of 33.
Discussion
We present the first case series suggestive of clinically
significant depressed mood and neurocognitive impair-
ment following MoM hip failure with concomitant chro-
mium and cobalt toxicity.
Depression
might
be
mediated
by
psychological
mechanisms – fear of the need for further surgery and
ongoing problems with pain and mobility being fre-
quently cited concerns. Neurocognitive abnormalities
however might be mediated by either static brain dam-
age caused by chromium and cobalt toxicity or could
represent a dynamic process, that is an early onset de-
mentia triggered by metallosis. If the latter is the case it
might have major, as yet unrecognised, implications for
public health.
Conclusions
We conclude that all clinicians, including those working
the fields of orthopaedic, psychiatry and primary care
should be aware of the need to assess the neuropsychi-
atric state of their patients after MoM implant opera-
tions. The MMSE and BDI, or similar instruments,
would be convenient tools for this. An important corol-
lary of this would be that patients presenting with
neuropsychiatric symptoms de novo and who have had
orthopaedic implant surgery, should have investigations
for chrome and cobalt toxicity.
Other than revision surgery there is no effective ad-
sorption or chelation therapy for chromium and cobalt,
and if such therapies could be safely developed, it may
avoid the need for further surgery. In the meantime, to
preserve neurocognitive function implant removal con-
ceivably should be as soon as possible after toxicity is
detected.
There is a possibility of identification of the neuro-
pathological substrate to dementia in such patients [17].
There is to date no neuroimaging study or any autopsy
brain tissue analysis on these patients and this would
be a future area of research, as would studies looking
at the mediating process linking any toxicity with
neurocognitive impairment including studies on aller-
gic response and protein accumulation in the brain or
direct neurotoxicity
There are additionally potential public health implica-
tions for the care needed by many thousands of patients
who have potentially suffered MoM related cobalt and
chrome toxicity, should progressive cognitive decline be
found in this group and the associated requirements for
dementia care. This has some and relevance to product
liability litigation worldwide. However we believe that
any commercial factors should be set aside in the inter-
est of public safety and the bioethical principle of social
justice.
Strengths and limitations
These are novel findings, which are published for the
first time, in a small study of sample of patients from a
consecutive series of medicolegal referrals, which may
have selection bias. A longitudinal study on a larger, ran-
domised cohort is recommended. Small sample sizes can
be more susceptible to selection bias and random error,
we suggest that further toxicological, neurological, and
epidemiological studies be conducted.
