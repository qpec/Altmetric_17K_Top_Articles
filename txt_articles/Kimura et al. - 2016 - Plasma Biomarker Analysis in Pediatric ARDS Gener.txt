Objective: Lung injury activates multiple pro-inflammatory pathways, including 
neutrophils, epithelial, and endothelial injury, and coagulation factors leading to acute 
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Low-dose methylprednisolone therapy (MPT) 
improved oxygenation and ventilation in early pediatric ARDS without altering duration 
of mechanical ventilation or mortality. We evaluated the effects of MPT on biomarkers 
of endothelial [Ang-2 and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1)] or epi-
thelial [soluble receptor for activated glycation end products (sRAGE)] injury, neutrophil 
activation [matrix metalloproteinase-8 (MMP-8)], and coagulation (plasminogen activator 
inhibitor-1).
Design: Double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial.
Setting: Tertiary-care pediatric intensive care unit (ICU).
Patients: Mechanically ventilated children (0–18 years) with early ARDS.

interventions: Blood samples were collected on days 0 (before MPT), 7, and 14 during 
low-dose MPT (n = 17) vs. placebo (n = 18) therapy. The MPT group received a 2-mg/
kg loading dose followed by 1 mg/kg/day continuous infusions from days 1 to 7, tapered 
off over 7 days; placebo group received equivalent amounts of 0.9% saline. We analyzed 
plasma samples using a multiplex assay for five biomarkers of ARDS. Multiple regression 
models were constructed to predict associations between changes in biomarkers and 
the clinical outcomes reported earlier, including P/F ratio on days 8 and 9, plateau pres-
sure on days 1 and 2, PaCO2 on days 2 and 3, racemic epinephrine following extubation, 
and supplemental oxygen at ICU discharge.
results: No differences occurred in biomarker concentrations between the groups on 
day 0. On day 7, reduction in MMP-8 levels (p = 0.0016) occurred in the MPT group, 
whereas increases in sICAM-1 levels (p = 0.0005) occurred in the placebo group (no 
increases in sICAM-1 in the MPT group). sRAGE levels decreased in both MPT and pla-
cebo groups (p < 0.0001) from day 0 to day 7. On day 7, sRAGE levels were positively 
correlated with MPT group PaO2/FiO2 ratios on day 8 (r = 0.93, p = 0.024). O2 require-
ments at ICU transfer positively correlated with day 7 MMP-8 (r = 0.85, p = 0.016) and 
Ang-2 levels (r = 0.79, p = 0.036) in the placebo group and inversely correlated with day 
7 sICAM-1 levels (r = −0.91, p = 0.005) in the MPT group.
conclusion: Biomarkers selected from endothelial, epithelial, or intravascular factors can 
be correlated with clinical endpoints in pediatric ARDS. For example, MPT could reduce 
neutrophil activation (⇓MMP-8), decrease endothelial injury (⇔sICAM-1), and allow epi-
thelial recovery (⇓sRAGE). Large ARDS clinical trials should develop similar frameworks.

We published the first pilot randomized trial of low-dose 
methylprednisolone therapy (MPT) for early pediatric ARDS 
examining the feasibility of this therapy (6). We modified the 
protocol for administering MPT in adult ARDS (3), which 
includes the slow tapering of MPT dosage over 1 week to avoid 
rebound lung inflammation and systemic inflammatory response 
syndrome (SIRS) leading to recurrent respiratory failure (7). 
MPT therapy did not alter ventilator-free days or mortality but 
appeared to alter oxygenation and ventilation (6). We also exam-
ined different regulatory patterns of pro- and anti-inflammatory 
plasma cytokines in the MPT and placebo groups to identify 
several cytokines as potential predictors for alterations in clinical 
parameters of disease severity (8). Larger randomized controlled 
studies are warranted for investigating corticosteroid use in early 
pediatric ARDS.
Corticosteroids are widely used in pediatric patients with 
ARDS (4), but their effects on biomarker levels in ARDS remain 
unknown. We selected five plasma biomarkers signifying the 
endothelial [Ang-2 and soluble intercellular adhesion mol-
ecule-1 (sICAM-1)], epithelial [soluble receptor for activated 
glycation end products (sRAGE)], coagulation [plasminogen 
activator inhibitor (PAI-1)], and neutrophil [matrix metallo-
proteinase-8 (MMP-8)] factors contributing to the pathogenesis 
BacKGrOUnD
The pathogenesis of acute respiratory distress syndrome 
(ARDS) may result from dysregulated inflammation in the 
endothelial and epithelial spaces from pulmonary or systemic 
circulations (1). ARDS is associated with alveolar and inter-
stitial edema, infiltration of inflammatory cells (neutrophils 
and macrophages) into the alveolar space due to vascular 
permeability, abnormal coagulation, and endothelial and 
alveolar epithelial injury (1). Corticosteroids may suppress 
this dysregulated inflammation in ARDS and thereby improve 
clinical outcomes (2). In adult patients with ARDS, early 
low-dose corticosteroid treatment showed promising results 
(3). However, the American College of Critical Care Medicine 
recommends the use of corticosteroids only for adult patients 
with moderate to severe ARDS resulting from community-
acquired pneumonia (grade 2B). A single-center retrospective 
study reported that utilization of corticosteroids in pediatric 
ARDS was associated with worsening clinical outcomes (4). 
However, this study did not record the indications for corti-
costeroid administration and neither considered the length of 
therapy nor the need for tapering steroids to prevent rebound 
inflammation (5).

potential framework for studying ARDS pathogenesis in future 
clinical trials.

clinical trial
A double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial (https://
clinicaltrial.gov, NCT01274260) was conducted in pediatric 
intensive care unit (PICU) in Le Bonheur children’s hospital 
in Memphis, TN, USA (6). The Institutional Review Board of 
University of Tennessee Health Science Center approved this 
study. Children (0–18 years) fulfilling the Berlin definition of 
ARDS and receiving mechanical ventilation were included in 
the study after informed consent. Patients receiving glucocorti-
coids chronically, terminally ill or in hospice care, immunosup-
pressed, with extensive burns, adrenal insufficiency, vasculitis, 
diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, invasive fungal infection, chronic 
liver disease or gastrointestinal bleed within the past 1 month, 
or conditions with estimated 6-month mortality of >50% were 
excluded from the study. The patients were randomized into 
low-dose methylprednisolone (MPT, n = 17, and no death) 
or placebo (n = 18 and two deaths) group. There were no 
significant differences in baseline characteristics including age, 
weight, gender, race, pediatric risk of mortality (PRISM) III 
score, pediatric index of mortality-2 score, P/F ratio, PEEP, tidal 
volume (milliliter per kilogram), mean airway pressure, blood 
gas pH, PaCO2, and the number of lobes affected on chest X-ray. 
Only exceptions were higher plateau pressure of mechanical 
ventilation (p = 0.006) and lower pediatric logistic organ 
dysfunction scores (p = 0.04) in the MPT group. The causes 
of ARDS were mainly primary ARDS (>3/4 of the patients in 
both groups). The most common cause was pneumonia (12 in 
MPT and 7 in the placebo), followed by aspiration (5 in MPT 
and 7 in the placebo), bronchiolitis (4 in MPT and 3 in the 
placebo), and near drowning (2 in MPT and 2 in the placebo). 
The patients in the MPT group received a 2 mg/kg MPT loading 
dose within 72 h after diagnosis of ARDS, followed by a 1 mg/
kg/day continuous infusion from days 1 to 7, then tapered off
 
over 7 days. If patients were extubated before day 7, the dosage 
protocol was advanced to day 7 followed by tapering. Patients 
were ventilated according to ARDSnet recommendations modi-
fied for children using pressure regulated volume control mode 
of Servo-i ventilators (Maquet) set at tidal volume of 6–8 ml/
kg (ideal body weight if the patient is obese). All the patients 
finished the study. Two patients died in the placebo group 
and no one in the MPT (p = 0.15). The duration of mechani-
cal ventilation was 9.74 ± 6.62 days in the placebo group and 
9.59 ± 5.21 days in the MPT (p = 0.94). There were no significant 
differences in ventilator-free days or length of stay in intensive 
care unit (ICU) or hospital between the groups. The MPT group 
had lower PaCO2 values on days 2 and 3, higher pH on day 2, 
higher PaO2/FiO2 ratios on days 8 and 9, fewer patients required 
racemic epinephrine inhalation treatment for post-extubation 
stridor, and fewer patients required supplemental oxygen at 
ICU transfer. MPT was not associated with any adverse effects, 
including secondary bacterial infection, hyperglycemia, and 
hypertension monitored regularly.
Plasma Samples
Blood samples were collected in lavender-top, EDTA-containing 
tubes at day 0 (before steroid administration) and day 7 during 
the randomized control trial. The blood samples were transported 
to our hospital central laboratory, centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 
10 min at 4°C, and stored at −80°C until used.
Biomarker analysis
We analyzed these plasma samples for MMP-8, Ang-2, PAI-1, 
sICAM-1, and sRAGE using a multiplex assay (Millipore, 
Billerica, MA, USA, cat#HSP4MAG-63K, #HAGP1MAG-
12K, #HSP1MAG-63K, #HSCRMAG-32K), according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions. A standard curve was prepared over 
concentrations of 0.14–100 ng/ml for MMP-8, 13.7–10,000 pg/
ml for Ang-2, 12–50,000 pg/ml for PAI-1 and sRAGE, and 
60–250,000 pg/ml for sICAM-1. All samples were run in dupli-
cates, and the average concentrations were used for statistical 
analysis. Only a few samples showed the biomarker values below 
or above the limit of the standard curve (two samples were above 
the limit on day 0 and one sample on day 7 below the limit for 
MMP-8. One sample on day 7 was below the limit for sRAGE).
Statistical analysis
We used univariate (descriptive statistics and frequency 
distributions), bivariate (Fisher’s test for variability, t-tests, 
and Pearson’s correlations), and multivariate analyses (multi-
variate linear regressions using the least squares method) to 
evaluate the effects of MPT in pediatric ARDS. We used StatPlus 
(AnalystSoft, Inc.) for generating descriptive statistics and 
frequency distributions for all biomarker levels at days 0 and 7 
for the placebo and MPT groups. We used Prism 6 (GraphPad 
Software, Inc.) for comparing between the randomized groups 
at days 0 and 7, and comparing between days 0 and 7 within the 
MPT or placebo groups. Either the unpaired two-tailed t-test 
(parametric) or the Mann–Whitney U test (non-parametric) 
was used for group comparisons, after comparing their vari-
ances by the F test.
A correlation matrix for pairwise associations of Pearson cor-
relation coefficients was also generated with simultaneously run 
t-tests for pathway analysis of the measured mediators. We used 
pairs of variables demonstrating strong correlation coefficients 
(R ≥ 0.7, p ≤ 0.01) to build multivariate regression models for 
predicting the clinical outcomes reported earlier (6), namely, 
PaO2/FiO2 (P/F) ratio on days 8 and 9, plateau pressure on days 
1 and 2, PaCO2 on days 2 and 3, need for racemic epinephrine 
following extubation, or supplemental oxygen at ICU discharge.
We created bivariate correlation matrices and bar graphs using 
raw data without adjustment or imputation. Rarely, imputation of 
missing biomarker values was necessary to build the multivariate 
regression models explaining or contributing to glucocorticoid 
treatment-associated clinical outcomes. Biomarker values falling 
above or below the extreme values of the standard curve were 
assigned the highest or lowest values on the generated standard 
curve. Since these were exploratory, hypothesis-generating

Baseline and time-Dependent changes in 
Plasma Biomarker levels
No differences occurred in the baseline concentrations of plasma 
biomarkers between the placebo and MPT groups on day 0 or 
on day 7. Within group, comparisons showed that MMP-8 levels 
decreased from day 0 to 7 (p = 0.0016) in the MPT group, but 
not in the placebo group. sICAM-1 levels increased significantly 
from day 0 to 7 (p = 0.0005) in the placebo group, but not in the 
MPT group. sRAGE levels decreased in both MPT and placebo 
groups (p < 0.0001) from day 0 to day 7 (Table 1). No significant 
differences occurred in Ang-2 and PAI-1 levels (Figure 1).
correlation between Biomarkers and 
clinical Outcomes
Pearson’s correlation tests analyzed associations between bio-
marker levels and the clinical outcomes reported previously (6), 
including (1) P/F ratios on days 8 and 9, (2) mechanical ventilator 
plateau pressures on days 1 and 2, (3) PaCO2 values on days 2 
and 3, (4) pH values on day 2, (5) need for racemic epinephrine 
following extubation, and (6) supplemental oxygen at PICU 
discharge (Table 2).
Soluble receptor for activated glycation end product levels 
(r = 0.93, p = 0.024) on day 7 correlated positively with improved 
oxygenation (PaO2/FiO2 ratios) on day 8 in the MPT group 
(Table 2), but not in the placebo group. Plateau pressures on day 
1 were positively correlated with sRAGE on day 0 in both MPT 
(r = 0.66, p = 0.007), and placebo (r = 0.62, p = 0.006) groups. 
Plateau pressure on day 1 was also positively correlated with 
Ang-2 on day 7 in the placebo group (r = 0.86, p = 0.013), but 
not in the MPT group.
PaCO2 levels on days 2 and 3 did not correlate with any 
biomarker levels in either group. High pH on day 2 correlated 
with PAI-1 in the MPT group (r = 0.67, p = 0.009), but not in 
the placebo group. Racemic epinephrine therapy at extubation 
was positively correlated with MMP-8 in the placebo group on 
both day 0 and day 8 (r = 0.55, p = 0.021 and r = 0.76, p = 0.048, 
respectively), but not in the MPT group.
Supplemental oxygen at ICU transfer was inversely correlated 
with sICAM-1 on day 7 in the MPT group (r = −0.91, p = 0.005), 
but in the placebo group, it positively correlated with PAI-1 on 
day 0 (r = 0.75, p = 0.000), MMP-8 on day 7 (r = 0.85, p = 0.016), 
and Ang-2 on day 7 (r = 0.79, p = 0.036).
DiScUSSiOn
A randomized controlled trial of low-dose MPT for children with 
early pediatric ARDS (6) did not change mortality or morbidity 
(ventilator-free days at day 28) but altered the clinical parameters 
for oxygenation and ventilation. An observational study showed 
that 60% of pediatric patients received corticosteroids during the 
course of ARDS, and that exposure of corticosteroids for >24 h 
was independently associated with longer duration of mechanical 
ventilation (4). Those patients received corticosteroid with differ-
ent regimens secondary to septic shock or other clinical indica-
tions. Thus, corticosteroid therapy for pediatric ARDS will remain 
controversial until larger controlled studies are performed. We 
propose that specific markers for endothelial or epithelial injury, 
coagulation and neutrophil activation, with known roles in the 
pathophysiology of ARDS, be selected as explanatory variables 
in future clinical trials.
In our study, MMP-8 levels decreased in the MPT group, but 
did not change in the placebo group. Also MMP-8 levels at days 
0 and 7 positively correlated with supplemental O2 at transfer 
from PICU in the placebo group. The role of MMP-8 is not 
only extracellular matrix turnover but also positive modulation 
of inflammation and other physiological activities (9). In mice 
hyperoxia-induced acute lung injury model, MMP-8 was upregu-
lated and seems to be produced in neutrophils, mesenchymal cell, 
and macrophages (10). In ventilator-induced lung injury model, 
absence of MMP-8 by knockout mice or specific inhibition of 
MMP-8 were associated with improved gas exchange, decreased 
lung edema and permeability, and decreased histological lung

detected in MPT and control groups on day 0 or day 7. Two-tailed unpaired t or u test dependent were used dependent upon variances differences evaluated by F 
test. On day 7, we observed a significant reduction in plasma levels of MMP-8 (p = 0.0016) in the MPT and a significant increase in plasma levels of sICAM-1 
(p = 0.0005) in the placebo group (MPT group had no increase by day 7). Levels of sRAGE decreased significantly in both the MPT and placebo groups (p < 0.002) 
from day 0 to day 7. A p-value of <0.05 was considered significant (*).

injury (11). Early elevations of MMP-8 in the bronchoalveolar 
lavage (BAL) fluid were associated with prolonged mechanical 
ventilation in pediatric ARDS (12), greater acute lung injury with 
higher PaO2/FiO2 ratios in adult patients (13), but did not predict 
their 90-day mortality (14). Overall decreases in MMP-8 levels 
seem to be associated with the reduction in local and systemic 
inflammation. In this study, MMP-8 levels did not decrease and 
were positively correlated with IL-6 and IL-10 on days 0 and 7 in 
the placebo group, possibly due to sustained active inflammation 
even on day 7 in the placebo group. Therefore, we can generate 
a hypothesis that MPT decreased lung inflammation via down-
regulation of MMP-8 in inflammatory cells, thus promoted early

recovery from ARDS, and improved oxygenation in the recovery 
phase. This hypothesis needs to be validated in a future trial.
During sepsis or ARDS, Ang-2 is upregulated in the endothe-
lium and believed to antagonize Ang-1. Upregulated Ang-2 
is associated with impaired endothelial barrier function and 
increased adhesion and migration of inflammatory cells (15). 
Clinical studies in adults demonstrated higher plasma Ang-2 
concentrations in ARDS patients (16), also associated with later 
development of ARDS (17), and ARDS mortality in adult patients 
(18, 19). Children with severe sepsis or septic shock have higher 
Ang-2 levels or Ang-2/Ang-1 ratios as compared to patients with 
SIRS (20). In this study, Ang-2 levels on day 7 correlated with 
plateau pressures on day 1 and the need for supplemental O2 at 
ICU discharge in the placebo group. This may indicate that acute 
lung injury on day 1 correlated with endothelial injury on day 7 
and endothelial injury on day 7 correlated with oxygenation at 
ICU discharge. In the MPT group, Ang-2 levels on day 7 nega-
tively correlated with IL-1RA. This may indicate that MPT may 
decrease endothelial injury via induction of anti-inflammatory 
cytokine, IL-1RA.
Soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 is an adhesion 
molecule expressed in the membrane of leukocytes, vascular 
endothelium, and alveolar epithelium (21). It is involved in 
neutrophil recruitment into the lung. In adults, plasma sICAM-1 
levels appear to correlate with ARDS development (22, 23) and 
ARDS mortality (22, 24, 25). In pediatric ARDS, early elevation of 
sICAM-1 was associated with prolonged duration of mechanical 
ventilation and increased mortality (26, 27). In this study, sICAM-1 
levels increased from day 0 to 7 in the placebo group, whereas in 
the MPT group sICAM-1 levels on day 7 were positive predic-
tors for O2 supplement at transfer. This indicates that MPT may 
prevent endothelial injury, decrease permeability, and improve 
pulmonary edema leading to improved oxygenation. sICAM-1 
levels correlated with Ang-2 levels on days 0 and 7, indicating 
similar roles as endothelial injury biomarkers. Interestingly, both 
sICAM-1 and Ang-2 levels in the placebo group had positive 
correlation with many cytokines on day 7. However, in the MPT 
group, Ang-2 and sICAM-1 on day 7 did not correlate with these 
cytokines. These findings may indicate that the endothelial injury 
underlying pediatric ARDS may continue until later phases of 
ARDS, dependent upon the degree of the inflammation, if not 
treated with corticosteroid.
Soluble receptor for activated glycation end products, the 
secreted forms of the epithelial RAGE membrane receptors, 
are multiligand-binding receptors that can bind advanced 
glycation end products, amyloid beta-peptide, S100 proteins, 
and high-mobility group box-1. It results in activation of the 
pro-inflammatory transcription factor nuclear factor-kB (NF-
kB) (28). sRAGE levels in plasma and BAL were elevated in rat 
models of lung injury (29). In adult ARDS studies, its results are 
controversial. In adult ARDS, sRAGE level was associated with 
ARDS development and mortality (30, 31). However, in other 
studies, sRAGE did not show any association with the develop-
ment of ARDS (17, 32, 33). Recent study demonstrated that 
serum sRAGE was elevated in children with severe bronchiolitis 
(34); however, there are no published data in pediatric ARDS. In 
this study, sRAGE levels decreased in all subjects, MPT, and the 
 7

placebo groups from days 0 to 7. Furthermore, sRAGE levels on 
day 0 are predictors of higher plateau pressure on day 1 in both 
the groups. This indicates that higher plateau pressure correlated 
with more epithelial injury in early ARDS. However, by day 7, 
sRAGE levels decreased in both the MPT and placebo groups. 
Does this indicate that epithelial injury is more likely in the early 
stages of ARDS compared to the later stage? sRAGE levels on 
day 0 positively correlated with IL-6 levels in both the MPT and 
placebo groups, and this could be a manifestation of the pro-
inflammatory effect of sRAGE.
Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 is an anti-fibrinolytic 
agent. During ARDS, deposition of fibrin in the alveolar space 
is observed with disruption of the lung endothelial and alveolar 
epithelial barrier (35). Elevation of PAI-1 activity in plasma and 
air spaces associated with a decrease in alveolar fibrinolysis is 
observed in early ARDS (36). In a secondary analysis from adult 
ARDS patients, an elevated plasma PAI-1 level was significantly 
associated with poor oxygenation (37). Elevated plasma PAI-1 
was also associated with mortality in pediatric ARDS (38). In 
this study, PAI-1 levels on day 0 correlated positively with high 
pH in the MPT group and were predictors of high pH on day 2 
in our linear regression model. On day 0, PAI-1 level correlated 
positively with many cytokines and chemokines. This indicates 
that increased severity of inflammation may be associated with 
the deposition of fibrin in earlier stages of ARDS.
In adult ARDS, the same MPT protocol was associated with 
decreases in plasma IL-6 and proadrenomedullin levels and 
increases in protein C levels, compared to the placebo (39). As 
previously reported, MPT decreased IL-6 in pediatric ARDS 
as well (8). Considering the biomarker changes in this study, 
we propose that corticosteroids may attenuate inflammation, 
promote early recovery from the epithelial injury, and prevent 
sustained endothelial damage, leading to earlier improvement in 
pulmonary edema and oxygenation seen as clinical outcomes. 
This hypothesis should be tested in larger clinical trials of MPT 
in pediatric ARDS in the future.
This is the first study to measure plasma biomarkers for 
endothelial and epithelial injury at the different time points of 
pediatric ARDS. However, proteomic analysis methods have 
further advanced, and now it is technically possible to measure 
1,310 protein levels simultaneously and precisely from just 150 μl 
of plasma samples (40, 41). Combinations of these biomarkers 
could discover novel therapeutic options and predictors of clini-
cal outcomes in the future.
Limitations of this study include a relatively small number 
of samples; therefore, our results need to be validated in larger 
clinical trials. Our clinical trial was designed to demonstrate the 
feasibility of the MPT protocol in pediatric early ARDS. Our 
biomarker analysis was not the main purpose of the study and 
we could not conduct functional analyses. Also, we only obtained 
clinical samples on days 0 and 7, whereas the timing for peak 
levels of these biomarkers may be different. Finally, we did not 
conduct BAL fluid collection or lung biopsy, so our results may 
not represent local pulmonary the changes but may represent 
systemic changes.
cOnclUSiOn
In this study, we demonstrated changes in selected biomarkers 
of ARDS between the placebo and MPT groups that were cor-
related with clinical endpoints. We cannot provide meaningful 
conclusions due to small sample size. However, we can generate a 
hypothesis that the anti-inflammatory effects of MPT may allow 
faster epithelial recovery manifested by decreases in sRAGE 
levels, thus avoiding sustained endothelial injury associated with 
elevated sICAM-1 levels in the placebo group. Future controlled 
studies with larger sample sizes should validate this hypothesis.
