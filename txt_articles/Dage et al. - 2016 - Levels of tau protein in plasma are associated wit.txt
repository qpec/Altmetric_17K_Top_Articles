Abstract
INTRODUCTION—Tau protein levels in plasma may be a marker of neuronal damage. We 
examined associations between plasma tau levels and Alzheimer's Disease (AD)-related MRI and 
PET neuroimaging measures among non-demented individuals.
METHODS—Participants included 378 cognitively normal (CN) and 161 Mild Cognitive 
Impairment (MCI) individuals enrolled in the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging with concurrent 
neuropsychological measures and amyloid PET, FDG-PET, and MRI imaging. Baseline plasma 
tau levels were measured using the Quanterix Simoa-HD1 tau assay.
RESULTS—Plasma tau levels were higher in MCI compared to CN (4.34 vs. 4.14 pg/mL, 
P=0.078). In regression models adjusted for age, sex, education, and APOE, higher plasma tau was 
associated with worse memory performance (b=−0.30, P=0.02) and abnormal cortical thickness in 
an AD signature region (OR=1.80, P=0.018).

1. Introduction
Several recent large Alzheimer's disease (AD) clinical trials targeting amyloid in mild or 
moderate AD have failed to show efficacy. These results have led to the hypothesis that 
treating individuals earlier in the disease course may be more effective at slowing or 
stopping disease progression. However, identifying asymptomatic individuals in the pre-
clinical or early mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stages of AD dementia for inclusion in 
clinical trials is difficult. Current non-invasive and inexpensive biomarkers have not been 
sufficiently sensitive to identify which patients are at greatest risk of progressing to MCI and 
AD dementia in the shortest period of time. For example, in the asymptomatic AD 
population imaging and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers have shown the most 
promise, but are yet insufficient to identify who will progress to MCI over a time frame 
amenable to an affordable clinical trial.
CSF levels of tau and phosphorylated (p)-tau are associated with the pathophysiology of AD 
and have been extensively shown to have utility in identifying patients at risk for progression 
to AD. However, CSF markers have limited application in large studies involving elderly 
patients due to associated costs, invasiveness of the procedure, and the common side effect 
of positional headache. For these reasons, blood-based biomarkers would be more amenable 
to large-scale screening to identify which subjects are at highest risk of progressing from 
cognitively normal to MCI or AD dementia.
Recent advances in the development of sensitive immunoassays have made it possible to 
detect tau in plasma. These methods have been used to investigate neurological damage from 
sports related injury and hypoxic brain injury after cardiac arrest [1,2]. Through these and 
other studies, the Zetterberg lab has demonstrated that acute brain injury can result in an 
increase in plasma tau levels, which do not always return back to baseline levels and may be 
associated with long term neurological damage [1,2]. In another study exploring the utility 
of plasma tau as diagnostic markers for MCI and AD, Zetterberg et al., reported that plasma 
tau levels were significantly elevated in AD, but not in MCI, compared to cognitively normal 
subjects [3]. Since there was significant overlap between the diagnostic groups, it was 
concluded that cross-sectional measurement of plasma tau would not be useful for AD 
diagnosis [3]. In an effort to replicate the initial findings by Zetterberg et al., and extend the 
assessment of plasma tau as a potential biomarker for preclinical and prodromal AD, we 
investigated plasma tau levels in cognitively normal and MCI subjects enrolled in the 
population-based Mayo Clinic Study of Aging (MCSA) [4,5]. We also examined the 
associations between plasma tau and neuroimaging measures of amyloid and 
neurodegeneration in AD-specific regions.

 2. Methods
2.1. Participants
The present study was conducted with data from the MCSA, a prospective population-based 
study that began in 2004 with the primary goal of determining the incidence and prevalence 
of MCI in Olmsted County, Minnesota [4]. The study initially recruited Olmsted County 
residents between the ages of 70 and 89 using an age- and sex-stratified random sampling 
design to ensure that men and women were equally represented in each 5-year age strata. 
Since 2004, the population has been re-enumerated several times and has been extended to 
cover the ages of 50–90+ following the same sampling strategy. Subjects randomly chosen 
for recruitment were invited to participate in the MCSA and those without a medical 
contraindication (e.g., pacemaker) were invited to participate in imaging studies. The present 
analyses included 539 participants, aged 56–95, who had plasma tau measures, 
neuroimaging (amyloid positron emission tomography (PET), fluorodeoxyglucose-PET 
(FDG-PET), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) and/or cognitive testing at the same 
study visit.
The study protocols were approved by the Mayo Clinic and Olmsted Medical Center 
Institutional Review Boards. All participants provided written informed consent.
2.2. Participant assessment
MCSA visits included a physician examination, an interview by a study coordinator, and 
neuropsychological testing administered by a psychometrist [4]. Physician examinations 
included a review of the participant's medical history, a complete neurological examination, 
and administration of the Short Test of Mental Status [6]. Study coordinator interviews 
reviewed participant demographic information, medical history, and completion of the 
participant and informant Clinical Dementia Rating scale [7].
The neuropsychological battery included nine tests covering four domains: 1) memory 
(Auditory Verbal Learning Test Delayed Recall Trial [8]; Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised 
Logical Memory II & Visual Reproduction II [9]); 2) language (Boston Naming Test [10] 
and Category Fluency [11]); 3) executive function (Trail Making Test B [12] and WAIS-R 
Digit Symbol subtest [13]); and 4) visuospatial skills (WAIS-R Picture Completion and 
Block Design subtests) [13]. Using the mean and standard deviation (SD) from the MCSA 
2004 enrollment cohort, which excluded subjects with dementia, participant test scores were 
converted to z-scores. Global cognition was calculated using the z-transformed averages of 
the four other domains.
2.3. MCI diagnostic determination
For each participant, performance in a cognitive domain was compared with the age-
adjusted scores of cognitively normal individuals previously obtained using Mayo's Older 
American Normative Studies [14]. This approach relies on prior normative work and 
extensive experience with the measurement of cognitive abilities in an independent sample 
of subjects from the same population. Subjects with scores more than 1.5 SD below the age-
specific mean in the general population were considered for possible cognitive impairment.

 A final decision about impairment in a cognitive domain was made after taking into account 
education, prior occupation, visual or hearing deficits, and reviewing all other participant 
information. The diagnosis of MCI was made by a consensus agreement between the study 
coordinator, examining physician, and neuropsychologist using published criteria [4]. 
Individuals who performed in the normal range and did not meet criteria for MCI or 
dementia were deemed cognitively normal.
2.4. Plasma tau enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) of MCSA samples
Participants' blood was collected in-clinic after an overnight fast. The blood was centrifuged, 
aliquoted, and stored at −80°C. Plasma tau was meas ured on the Quanterix Simoa-HD1 
Platform. hTau kits (101444) were purchased from Quanterix and used according to the kit 
protocol with minor modifications. The capture antibody recognizes amino acid 16–24 and 
the detector antibody recognizes amino acid 218–222. Briefly, plasma samples were 
analyzed at a 1/8 dilution and in triplicate across three identically prepared sample plates. 
Standard curves and individual sample measurements were calculated using Excel 2010 and 
Graph Pad Prism (version 6). Each batch was analyzed using six standard replicate curves 
and applying a four parameter logistic fit with 1/Y2 weighting. The reported sample values 
represented the mean of three replicate measures with an overall CV of 10.5% across all 
batches. During data analysis, a small number (<2 %) of individual measurements did not 
result in experimental values or were deemed outliers due to incomplete washing, and were 
excluded from calculation of mean results. Both of these reasons for excluding one of three 
replicates were due to known instrument malfunctions and never resulted in failure to report 
a subject's mean value. In all cases at least two replicate values were available to calculate a 
mean result for each subject.
2.5. Imaging methods
Amyloid PET imaging was performed with Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) [15], and FDG-
PET was obtained on the same day. Participants also completed computed tomography (CT) 
at that time for attenuation correction. Amyloid PET images were acquired from 40–60 
minutes and FDG from 30–50 minutes after injection. Amyloid PET and FDG-PET were 
analyzed with our in-house fully automated image processing pipeline [16], where image 
voxel values are extracted from automatically labeled regions of interest (ROIs) propagated 
from an MRI template. An amyloid PET standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) was 
formed from the prefrontal, orbitofrontal, parietal, temporal, anterior cingulate, and posterior 
cingulate/precuneus ROIs normalized to uptake in cerebellar grey matter. The data was 
partial volume corrected for voxel CSF content using segmented coregistered MRI. An AD-
characteristic FDG-PET SUVR was formed from the angular gyrus, posterior cingulate, and 
inferior temporal cortical ROIs normalized to pons and vermis [17]. FDG-PET data were not 
partial volume corrected (in our experience doing so eliminates a substantial portion of the 
apparent biological signal) [18–20].
All MRI scans were completed on one of three 3T machines from the same vendor, and 
cortical surface was parcellated using FreeSurfer version 5.3.0 (https://
surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/). Hippocampal volume (HVa) was adjusted for total intracranial 
volume (TIV), using our in-house fully automated imaging processing pipeline [16]. An

 AD-signature cortical thickness measure was composed of the following individual cortical 
thickness ROIs: entorhinal, inferior temporal, middle temporal, and fusiform.
2.6. Definition of elevated amyloid PET and abnormal HVa
We set the cut point for elevated PiB PET and MRI measures using the 90th percentile from 
a sample of 75 AD dementia subjects from the Mayo Clinic, as described by Jack and 
colleagues [21]. Elevated amyloid PET was defined as SUVR >1.40, a value validated with 
autopsy correlation [22]. Abnormal HVa was defined as departure of −2.39 cm3 or more 
from expected HVa, adjusted for TIV. Abnormal AD-signature region cortical thickness was 
defined at <2.74 mm. Finally, abnormal glucose uptake was demarcated at SUVR<1.32.
2.7. Assessment of covariates
Participant demographics (e.g., sex, age, years of education) were ascertained during the in-
person interview at the in-clinic exam. Participants' height (cm) and weight (kg) were also 
measured during the in-clinic exam to calculate body mass index (BMI). A history of 
diabetes, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and myocardial infarction were abstracted from the 
medical records. Participants were asked to bring all of their medication into the visit and 
were asked if they were currently taking each medication. Apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 
allele genotyping was performed from a blood draw taken at the in-clinic exam.
2.8 Statistical analyses
The relationships between plasma tau levels and dichotomous variables were examined 
using Mann-Whitney rank sum tests. The distribution of plasma tau was right-skewed so the 
variable was natural log-transformed prior to subsequent regression analyses. We used 
logistic regression to determine the cross-sectional association between log-transformed 
plasma tau levels (as a continuous measure or in quartiles) and odds of having abnormal 
neuroimaging. Linear regression models were used to determine the association between 
plasma tau and cognitive test z-scores. Both linear and logistic regression models were 
adjusted for multiple covariates based on the literature and their association with plasma tau. 
Model 1 was unadjusted. Model 2 adjusted for age, sex, education, and APOE ε4. Model 3 
adjusted for the variables in Model 2 and BMI, medical conditions (hypertension, diabetes, 
atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction), and medications (statins, diabetes, medication, 
Coumadin). All analyses were completed using Stata Version 12.0 (StataCorp, College 
Station, TX).
3. Results
3.1. Participants characteristics and description of plasma tau data
Of the 539 participants, the median age (Interquartile range [IQR]) was 80 (77, 84) and 331 
(61.4%) were male. The median (IQR) education was 14 (12, 16) and BMI was 27.1 (24.4, 
30.3). There were 159 (29.5%) with an APOE ε4 allele and 161 (29.9%) had a diagnosis of 
MCI. The raw plasma tau levels ranged from 0.88 to 16.38 pg/mL with median and mean 
values of 4.18 (interquartile range, (IQR) = 3.33, 5.12) and 4.39 (SD = 1.72) pg/mL, 
respectively.

 The associations between plasma tau and dichotomous participant characteristics are shown 
in Tables 1, stratified by cognitive status. In general, the associations with plasma tau were 
similar in the cognitive normal and MCI groups but the results with the cognitively normal 
individuals were more frequently statistically significant. Among the cognitively normal 
participants, plasma tau levels were significantly higher in those who were older than 80 
years, had a diagnosis of diabetes, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction and 
those who took non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications, statins, diabetic medications, 
and statins. Among the MCI participants, plasma tau levels were significantly higher in 
those with a diagnosis of diabetes, hypertension and atrial fibrillation, and among those who 
were taking Coumadin. Examining neuroimaging measures, cognitively normal individuals 
(but not MCI) with abnormal amyloid-PET or abnormal cortical thickness had higher plasma 
tau levels.
3.2 Plasma tau levels and imaging measures of amyloid and neurodegeneration
We evaluated the associations of plasma tau and abnormal neuroimaging biomarkers using 
logistic regression models. In unadjusted models, continuous levels of plasma tau were 
associated with higher odds of elevated PIB SUVR (odds ratio (OR) = 1.73; 95% confidence 
interval (CI), 1.10–2.72) (Table 2). Similarly, those in the highest quartile of plasma tau had 
almost a 2-fold greater odds of elevated PiB SUVR compared to those in the lowest quartile 
(OR = 1.80; 95% CI, 1.10–2.96). However, these associations were no longer significant in 
multivariable adjusted models. Among neuroimaging measures of neurodegeneration, we 
did not observe an association between plasma tau and abnormal HVa or FDG-PET. 
However higher plasma tau log levels were associated with higher odds of lower cortical 
thickness in the AD signature meta-ROI, including in the univariate and fully adjusted 
models (Table 2).
3.3 Plasma tau levels by MCI status
In logistic regression models adjusting for age, sex, education, and APOE genotype, each 
log unit increase in plasma tau was associated with increased odds of MCI (OR: 1.45; 95% 
CI, 0.88–2.37), but the results did not reach significance at the P < .05 level (Table 3). 
Adjusting for additional factors in Model 3 did not change the association. Examining 
plasma tau in quartiles, the highest quartile versus the lowest was also not significantly 
associated with increased odds in all three models (Table 3).
3.4 Association between plasma tau and cognitive test performance
We next examined the association between plasma tau and cognitive test performance (Table 
4). Higher log plasma tau levels were significantly associated with worse performance on 
tests of global cognition, memory, and attention/executive function, but not on tests of 
visuospatial or language ability (Table 4). After adjusting for covariates in Models 2 and 3, 
the association between higher plasma tau and worse memory performance remained. The 
analysis of plasma tau by quartiles did not substantially alter the associations between 
plasma tau and cognition.

 3.4 Plasma tau levels, MCI, and imaging measures of amyloid and neurodegeneration
Lastly, we evaluated the median plasma levels by cognitive status (CN or MCI) and amyloid 
(A) and neurodegeneration (N) imaging status (A−N−, A+N−, A+N+, A−N+) using 
Kruskal-Wallis tests (Figure 1). We did not observe an overall difference across the groups 
(chi2, 7 df = 10.864, P = .145).
4. Discussion
This study evaluated the utility of plasma tau levels as a peripheral biomarker in the 
preclinical and prodromal stages of AD in a well-characterized population-based study with 
neuroimaging and cognitive measures. Higher levels of plasma tau were cross-sectionally 
associated with worse memory performance and lower cortical thickness in an AD-signature 
region, with a trend toward higher values in MCI than CN. In analyses comparing eight 
groups defined by cognitive status and amyloid and neurodegeneration neuroimaging 
markers, there was high overlap in plasma tau levels. These results suggest that plasma tau 
will not be useful as a stand-alone diagnostic biomarker in preclinical or prodromal AD. 
However, when p-tau or other neuronal degeneration related assays are available, plasma tau 
should be considered as a key member in a peripheral biomarker panel for AD. Future 
research will also be needed to determine the prognostic value of plasma tau or a biomarker 
panel.
Zetterberg et al. (2013) examined plasma tau among individuals clinically diagnosed as CN, 
MCI, or AD. They reported that plasma tau levels were significantly elevated in AD, but not 
in MCI, compared to CN subjects. Additionally, there was substantial overlap in plasma tau 
levels between the groups. Notably, the Zetterberg study had a small group of CN 
individuals (n = 25) and used a different assay, but the same highly sensitive Simoa-HD1 
platform. Despite the differences in the assays and sample size, the plasma tau levels among 
MCI subjects were similar between the two studies (mean = 4.68 pg/mL in the Zetterberg 
study and mean = 4.64 pg/mL in the present study). Our results are highly consistent with 
their results in that there was much overlap between groups and no difference between 
individuals who were CN or MCI. When we stratified by cognitive status (CN versus MCI) 
in table 1, plasma tau levels were also similarly elevated with age, the presence of vascular 
risk factors, and cortical thinning in both groups; although, the MCI group still tended to 
have higher, non-significant, levels in the presence of each factor. Additional longitudinal 
studies are needed to determine whether plasma tau could be useful as a pathological or 
prognostic biomarker or risk factor for AD. Our data suggest that plasma tau is cross-
sectionally associated with both cortical thinning and memory performance, even after 
controlling for potentially confounding factors such as age and diabetes. For example, it has 
been reported that type II diabetes patients exhibit cortical thinning patterns parallel to those 
observed in AD patients [23], but our observed association between plasma tau and cortical 
thickness remained significant after accounting for diabetes diagnosis and diabetes 
medications. Thus, our results support the hypothesis that plasma tau may be a peripheral 
biomarker of brain tissue injury [1,2] and further extends these findings to 
neurodegeneration associated with preclinical and prodromal AD.

 We found associations between higher plasma tau levels and worse memory performance, 
which remained significant after adjusting for multiple covariates. Although we are unaware 
of other reports of plasma tau correlating with cognition in any stage of the AD continuum, 
there are many studies showing that greater postmortem tau pathology is associated with 
worse pre-mortem cognition (reviewed in Nelson et al. [24]). Recent evidence using tau-PET 
also demonstrates increasing neurofibrillary tangle pathology with advancing AD stages 
[25]. The relationship between the measures of tau pathology in the brain, CSF tau, or 
plasma tau has yet to be fully explored, and we are aware only of one study, Zetterberg et al. 
(2013), that reported on the lack of relationship between CSF and plasma tau. CSF tau levels 
were not available to report for this study, so we were unable to compare plasma and CSF 
tau levels between groups. Future studies carefully investigating the relationship between 
tau-PET, CSF tau and plasma tau in the same cohort of subjects are needed to longitudinally 
ascertain their relationship with each other and in relation to disease progression. The 
reported disconnect between CSF tau and plasma tau will need further exploration, and it 
will be critical to measure CSF and plasma with similar assays and under similar conditions. 
It is reported that CSF tau is actually a compilation of many sized polypeptides originating 
from full length tau and similar to other proteins. Therefore the population and specific 
polypeptides formed in CSF and plasma may be different and, could have different utilities 
as biomarkers for AD [26].
Despite its strengths, limitations of the study warrant consideration. First, the plasma sample 
set was used for two separate studies to conserve samples and, thus, underwent at least one 
freeze-thaw cycle prior to analysis. Second, our findings may not be directly generalizable to 
other populations. Third, the study did not include subjects with AD dementia. The MCSA 
was designed to determine the incidence and prevalence of MCI in the population, and 
therefore initially excluded dementia patients at baseline. However, as these participants are 
followed, some will convert to dementia, so we will have the opportunity to investigate 
plasma tau levels across the AD spectrum. Fourth, plasma assays of p-tau are being 
developed but are not currently available. Future research is needed to determine whether 
plasma p-tau, in combination with plasma amyloid and total tau, could be a more useful 
diagnostic marker. Lastly, this study was cross-sectional. Due to the overlap across cognitive 
and neuroimaging groups, we cannot make a meaningful clinical decision at an individual 
subject level based on plasma tau levels. Future studies to evaluate the longitudinal changes 
of plasma tau over the preclinical and clinical AD time frame, and in relation to changes in 
amyloid and neurodegenerative neuroimaging measures, will provide additional insight into 
the utility of plasma tau in clinical trials or for patient management.
A peripheral measure associated with acute neuronal damage or chronic neurodegeneration 
in elderly subjects would be a major breakthrough in the field of neurodegeneration 
research, especially if the peripheral marker is directly associated with one of the defining 
pathologies of AD. Existing models and genetics of AD suggest amyloid deposition is 
necessary, but insufficient, to predict the development of AD dementia in the short term. A 
peripheral measure, plasma tau, could allow for routine, repeat testing of amyloid-positive 
subjects to determine their rate of disease progression and the effectiveness of potential 
disease-modifying future therapies. However, the longitudinal collection of plasma tau data 
over the next decades in controlled clinical trials of AD, traumatic brain injury, sports-

 related concussion and in aging studies is necessary to enhance our understanding of the 
utility of plasma tau as a biomarker or a risk factor of neuronal injury and AD-associated 
neurodegeneration. These studies will need to determine the appropriate sampling frequency 
and normal variation in an individual's plasma tau level in order to understand normal and 
disease related changes in a subjects tau levels.

 Highlights
1.
Higher plasma tau levels were cross-sectionally associated with worse 
memory performance and lower cortical thickness in an AD-signature 
region.
2.
In analyses comparing eight groups defined by cognitive status and 
neuroimaging measures, there was high overlap in plasma tau levels. 
These results suggest that plasma tau will not be useful as a stand-alone 
diagnostic biomarker in preclinical or prodromal AD.
3.
Future studies are needed to evaluate the longitudinal associations 
between plasma tau and neuroimaging measures of amyloid and 
neurodegeneration in the preclinical and clinical AD stages. This 
research is critical to assess the utility of plasma tau as a prognostic 
marker, for use in clinical trials, or for patient management.

 Research in context
1.
Systematic review: We reviewed the literature using traditional (e.g., 
PubMED) resources. While CSF tau has utility as an Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) biomarker, few studies have examined the utility of 
plasma tau.
2.
Interpretation: Higher plasma tau levels were cross-sectionally 
associated with worse memory performance and lower cortical 
thickness in an AD-signature region. In analyses comparing eight 
groups defined by cognitive status and neuroimaging measures, there 
was high overlap in plasma tau levels. These results suggest that plasma 
tau will not be useful as a stand-alone diagnostic biomarker in 
preclinical or prodromal AD.
3.
Future Directions: Future studies are needed to evaluate the 
longitudinal associations between plasma tau and neuroimaging 
measures of amyloid and neurodegeneration in the preclinical and 
clinical AD stages. This research is critical to assess the utility of 
plasma tau as a prognostic marker, for use in clinical trials, or for 
patient management.

 Fig. 1. Median log plasma tau levels by cognitive and neuroimaging amyloid and 
neurodegeneration biomarker status
Amyloid positive (A+) was defined as amyloid PET SUVR > 1.40. Neurodegeneration 
positive (N+) was defined as either an AD-signature region cortical thickness <2.74 mm or 
FDG-PET SUVR<1.32 in AD-signature regions. CN = cognitively normal; MCI = Mild 
cognitive impairment. The number of subjects in each group are as follows: 62 CN A−N−; 
90 CN A+N−; 133 CN A+N+; 89 CN A−N+; 27 MCI A−N−; 25 MCI A+N−; 76 MCI A+N
+; 31 MCI A−N+.
