Abstract
Background: High-fat (HF) diet-induced obesity is associated with changes in the gut microbiota. Fiber and other bioactive
compounds in plant-based foods are suggested to prevent gut dysbiosis brought on by HF feeding. Mango is high in fiber
and has been reported to have anti-obesogenic, hypoglycemic, and immunomodulatory properties.
Objectives: We investigated the effects of freeze-dried mango pulp combined with an HF diet on the cecal microbial
population and its relation to body composition, lipids, glucose parameters, short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production, and
gut inflammatory markers in a mouse model of diet-induced obesity.
Methods: Six-wk-old male C57BL/6 mice were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 dietary treatment groups: control (AIN-93M,
10% fat kcal), HF (60% fat kcal), and HF + 1% or 10% mango (HF+1%M or HF+10%M, wt:wt) for 12 wk. The cecal
microbial population was assessed by use of 16S rDNA sequencing. Body composition, plasma glucose and lipids, cecal
and fecal SCFAs, and mRNA abundance of inflammatory markers in the ileum and colonic lamina propria were assessed.
Results: Compared with the control group, HF feeding significantly reduced (P < 0.05) 1 operational taxonomic unit (OTU)
of the genus Bifidobacteria (64-fold) and 5 OTUs of the genus Akkermansia ($16-fold). This reduction was prevented in the
HF+10%M group, members of which had 10% higher final body weight compared with the HF group (P = 0.01) and similar
fasting blood glucose concentrations (P = 0.24). The HF+10%M group had 135% (P = 0.004) and 133% (P < 0.0001)
greater fecal acetic and n-butyric acids concentrations than the HF group, suggesting greater microbial fermentation.
Furthermore, a 59% greater colonic interleukin 10 (Il10) gene expression was observed in the HF+10%M group than in the
HF group (P = 0.048), indicating modulation of gut inflammation. The HF+1%M group generally did not differ from the HF
group.
Conclusions: The addition of mango to an HF diet modulated the gut microbiota and production of SCFAs in C57BL/6
mice; these changes may improve gut tolerance to the insult of an HF diet.

Introduction
A balance in the gut microbial population is essential in main-
taining gut homeostasis and plays an important role in the host�s
immune response (1, 2). Disruption of the gut microbial balance,
referred to as gut dysbiosis, is a feature of obesity and is associated
with the onset of obesity-related complications such as type
2 diabetes (T2D)8 and intestinal-related outcomes such as
inflammatory bowel disease characterized by gut inflamma-
tion (1–3).
Nondigestible carbohydrates provide a major source of energy
for the growth and sustenance of the commensal gut microbiota
(4). These dietary components are resistant to digestive enzymes,

 thus escaping to the distal gastrointestinal tract where they are
fermented by the resident bacteria predominantly into SCFAs
(1–3). High-fat (HF) diets induce gut dysbiosis characterized
by a reduction in total bacterial numbers, accompanied by loss
of Bifidobacteria, Bacteroides-related bacteria, Akkermansia,
and SCFA-producing species such as Roseburia spp. (3, 5–7).
Additionally, diet-induced obesity may result in both local and
systemic proinflammatory states, an important link of obesity
to its comorbidities (7).
Prebiotics and nondigestible carbohydrates influence the
gut microbiota and increase bacterial fermentation, resulting
in elevated SCFA production (primarily acetate, propionate, and
butyrate) (8). SCFAs have been established to possess a wide
range of beneficial effects both within and outside the gut. Within
the gut, butyrate is a preferred source of energy by colonic
epithelial cells, whereas propionate and acetate are absorbed
into the portal circulation and metabolized in the liver (9).
Butyrate and propionate exhibit anti-inflammatory properties
by promoting the differentiation of T-regulatory cells and
IL10-producing T cells, which are vital in maintaining gut
tolerance (10, 11). SCFAs may also indirectly impact glucose
homeostasis by stimulating the release of incretins from the
enteroendocrine L and K cells of the small intestine (12). The
various metabolic effects of acetate, propionate, and butyrate
on the host occur via interactions with G-protein-coupled
receptors including G-protein-coupled receptor 43 (GPR43)
(13). These findings indicate that the gut microbiota directly or
indirectly impact the host�s fuel metabolism and that preserv-
ing the balance of the gut microbiota may help reduce the
detrimental outcomes of HF diet-induced obesity (14).
The health benefits of mango have been widely acknowl-
edged (15, 16). Importantly, mango pulp has high fiber content
(;1.3–3.8 g/100 g), half of which is soluble fiber that may be
available to gut bacteria for fermentation (16, 17). In vitro
studies revealed that extracts from mango fruit peel and pulp
inhibit adipogenesis and reduce the growth of colonic cancer
cells (18, 19). We have also shown that mango pulp supplemen-
tation reduced blood glucose in mice fed a high-fat diet (20) and
obese individuals (21). Despite the reported health benefits of
mango, its effect on the gut microbiota in animals with HF
diet-induced dysbiosis is not known. Therefore, this study
investigated the effects of freeze-dried mango pulp on the gut
microbiota and its impact on body composition, blood glucose
and lipids, SCFA production, and gut inflammatory markers in
C57BL/6 mice fed an HF diet.
Methods
Animals and dietary treatments. Sixty 6-wk-old male C57BL/6 mice
(Charles River Laboratory) were acclimated for 1 wk and randomly
assigned to 1 of 4 dietary treatment groups (n = 15/group): control
(AIN-93M; 10% fat kcal), HF (60% fat kcal), and HF + 1% or 10%
mango (HF+1%M or HF+10%M, wt:wt) for 12 wk. Mice were housed
in wire-bottomed cages to reduce coprophagic activity in groups of
3–4 mice/cage.
Ripe Tommy Atkins variety mangoes were peeled, and the pulp
was freeze-dried, ground, and added at a dose of 1% and 10% (wt:wt).
The variety and doses of the mango used in this study were based on
our earlier work (20). All the HF diets were adjusted to have similar
macronutrients, calcium, phosphorus, and total fiber content (Supple-
mental Tables 1–3). The mice were given access to food and deionized
water ad libitum. Food intake was monitored 3 times/wk, and body
weights were recorded weekly. All procedures strictly adhered to the
guidelines set forth by the Oklahoma State University Animal Care and
Use Committee.
Glucose tolerance test. After 11 wk of treatment, mice were feed-
deprived for 6 h before conducting a glucose tolerance test. Blood glucose
was measured from tail blood by use of an AlphaTrak glucometer
(Abbott Laboratories) as described previously (20).
Tissue sampling and processing. Fecal samples were collected at
baseline and at the end of treatment and were stored in 280�C for later
analyses. At the end of the treatment period, the mice were deprived of
food for 3 h, weighed, and injected with a ketamine and xylazine cocktail
(80 and 8 mg/kg, respectively). Body composition was assessed by use of
a whole-body PixiMus scan (GE Lunar). Blood was collected from the
carotid artery into EDTA-coated tubes, centrifuged to obtain plasma,
and stored at 280�C until analyses. The liver, abdominal fat, pancreas,
and thymus were weighed and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen for later
analysis.
The ileum was flushed with saline, Peyer�s patches were removed, and
ileum was snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 280�C for later
analyses. The colon was flushed with ice-cold saline and incised, and the
lamina propria was collected in microcentrifuge tubes and stored at
280�C for RNA extraction and gene expression analyses. In addition,
the cecum was harvested, and its contents were flushed with ice-cold
saline. Flushed cecal contents were centrifuged, and the precipitate was
kept frozen at 280�C for microbiome analyses.
Gut microbiota. Frozen cecal samples (n = 4 mice/group) were shipped
overnight on dry ice to Second Genome Inc. Cecal DNA was extracted
with the MoBio PowerMag microbiome kit followed by normalization
of concentration. To ensure that all samples met minimum concentration
and DNA mass, samples were quantified by use of the Qubit Quant-iT
dsDNA Broad-Range Kit (Invitrogen, Life Technologies) followed by
DNA amplification to enrich for bacterial 16S V4 rDNA region. Ampli-
fication was done by use of fusion primers designed against surrounding
conserved regions, which are tallied with sequences incorporating
Illumina adapters and indexing barcodes. Samples were PCR amplified
with 2 differently barcoded V4 fusion primers and amplification products
quantified by qPCR. Samples that met post-PCR quantification mini-
mum were used for pooling and sequencing. A pool containing 16S V4-
enriched, amplified, and barcoded samples were loaded into the
cartridge on a MiSeq instrument (Illumina) for cluster formation. This
was followed by sequencing for 2 3 250 cycles by use of custom
primers designed for pair-end sequencing.
To determine the operational taxonomic unit (OTU), sequenced pair-
end reads were merged and dereplicated with USEARCH (22). Unique
sequences were then clustered at 97% similarity by UPARSE, and a
representative consensus sequenced per de novo OTU was determined.
Representative OTU sequences were then assigned taxonomic classifi-
cation via Mothur�s Bayesian classifier trained against the Greengenes
reference database of 16S rRNA gene sequences with 80% classification
confidence.
SCFA analyses. Cecal and fecal SCFAs were determined according to a
previously described method with modifications (23). Pooled cecal or
fecal samples were suspended in ice-cold Millipore H2O and spiked
with internal standard (1 mM 2-ethylbutyric acid in 12% formic acid).
The pH of the resulting cecal and fecal homogenates was adjusted to 2–3
by using 5 M HCl. Samples were incubated at room temperature and
centrifuged, and the supernatants were filtered by use of 0.45-mm
polytetrafluoroethylene syringe filters into chromatographic glass vials
(Agilent Technologies).
Gas chromatographic analysis was performed by use of an Agilent
6890N GC system with a flame ionizable detector and an automatic
liquid sampler (Agilent Technologies) as previously described (23). A
5-point calibration was done by use of standard solutions of acetic,
propionic, butyric, valeric, isovaleric, isobutyric, caproic and heptanoic
acids (Sigma-Aldrich).
RNA extraction and gene expression analysis. Total RNA was
isolated from the colon lamina propria and the ileum by use of TRIzol
reagent (Invitrogen). Relative gene expression of the SCFA receptor Gpr43,
the proinflammatory cytokines Il1b and Il6, and the anti-inflammatory

 cytokine Il10 was determined by use of qPCR as previously described
(24). qPCR analyses were performed by use of SYBR Green chemistry on
an ABI 7900HT sequence-detection instrument and 2.4 SDS software
(Applied Biosystems). The list of the oligonucleotide primers is shown
in Supplemental Table 4. The relative mRNA abundance was calculated
by use of the 22DDCt method (25), and the invariant control gene was
cyclophilin. The results are presented relative to the control group.
Plasma measurements. Plasma concentrations of TGs, nonesterified
fatty acids, total cholesterol (TC), and HDL cholesterol were mea-
sured by use of the BioLis 24i automated analyzer (Carolina Chemistry).
Non-HDL cholesterol concentrations were calculated by subtracting
HDL cholesterol from TC. Plasma incretins [gastric inhibitory peptide
(GIP) and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP1)], insulin, leptin, plasminogen
activator inhibitor 1, and resistin were measured by use of the Bio-Plex
array system (Bio-Rad) (26). Concentrations were determined by use of
the Bio-Plex MAGPIX Multiplex Reader and the Bio-Plex Manager 6.1
software for data analyses.
Liver lipids analyses. Liver total lipids, TGs and cholesterol were
determined as previously described with few modifications (27). Portions
of livers were homogenized and extracted with a 2:1 (vol:vol) chloro-
form:methanol mixture. After addition of 0.05% sulfuric acid to the
extraction solution and separation of phases, aliquots of the organic
phase were analyzed for liver TC and TGs by use of the BioLis 24i
clinical analyzer (Carolina Chemistry). Total liver lipids were determined
by use of the Folch gravimetric method (28).
Immunoblot analyses. Protein expression of the incretin receptors
GLP1 receptor (GLP1R) and GIP receptor (GIPR) were determined
in whole pancreatic homogenates (n = 5 mice/group) as previously
described with modifications (29). Total protein (20 mg) was electro-
phoretically separated by use of SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF
membranes (ThermoScientific), and membranes were blocked with 5%
nonfat dried milk (Nestle) followed by overnight incubation at 4�C with
the following rabbit polyclonal antibodies: GLP1R and GIPR (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology) and b-actin (Cell Signaling Technology). Blots were
then washed with PBS, incubated with an anti-rabbit IgG HRP-linked
antibody (Cell Signaling Technology), washed again with PBS, and
incubated with Pierce ECL western blotting substrate (ThermoScien-
tific). The blots were viewed with FluorChem R Imaging System
(ProteinSimple), and the resulting protein bands were quantified by use
of UNScanIT software, version 7.1 (Silk Scientific Inc.).
Statistical analyses. For the microbiome data, the Adonis function in
the vegan R package was used to test microbial community differences
between treatment groups. Univariate differential abundance of OTUs
at the genus level was tested by use of a negative binomial generalized
linear model for the overdispersion and Poisson process intrinsic to the
data, which was implemented in the DESeq2 package (30) and described
for microbiome applications by McMurdie and Holmes (31). DESeq2
was run under default settings, and the P values were corrected for false
discovery rates with the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure (32). Only
OTUs with the adjusted P value < 0.05 and more than one log 2-fold
change were reported.
Statistical analyses for all other data involved computation of
means 6 SEMs by use of SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute). The data were
checked for normal distribution by use of residual plots. ANOVA and
least square means were calculated by use of the mixed model
procedure, assuming the cage as the experimental unit and mice as the
sampling unit. The means were compared by use of protected Fisher�s
least significant difference for comparing groups. A P value # 0.05 was
considered statistically significant.
Results
Mango supplementation modulates gut microbiota in mice
fed HF diet. The Adonis test revealed significant microbiome
differences (P < 0.05) among all experimental diet groups (Table 1).
Next, we determined OTU-level taxa that could be driving the
microbial differences among the treatment groups. We observed
36 significantly higher OTUs in the control group than in the HF
group (P < 0.05). Notably, one OTU belonging to the genus
Bifidobacterium (species anomalis) was 64-fold higher (P =
0.04) in the control group than in the HF group (Figure 1A).
Additionally, 9 OTUs belonging to the genus Akkermansia or
Ruminococcus were $16-fold higher (P < 0.05) in the control
group than in the HF group (Figure 1A). All Akkermansia OTUs
higher in the control belonged to Akkermansia muciniphila.
Importantly, no OTU-level taxon belonging to Akkermansia or
Bifidobacteria was significantly different (P > 0.05) between the
control group and the HF+1%M and HF+10%M groups (Supple-
mental Figure 1A, B).
We observed no significant changes (P > 0.05) in any of the
OTUs belonging to currently classified bacteria genera in the HF
group compared with the HF+1%M group (Figure 1B). How-
ever, in the HF+10%M group, we observed 26 significantly
higher OTUs (P < 0.05) than in the HF group (Figure 1C). One
OTU belonging to the Bifidobacteria genus was 33-fold higher
(P = 0.03) in the HF+10%M group than in the HF group (Figure
1C). Similarly, one OTU of the Akkermansia genus was 109-fold
higher (P = 0.01) in the HF+10%M group than in the HF group,
and this belonged to A. muciniphila (Figure 1C). Furthermore,
one OTU belonging to the genus Adlercreutzia was 118-fold higher
(P = 0.01) and 4 Ruminococcus OTUs were $8-fold higher (P <
0.05) in the HF+10%M group than in the HF group. On the
other hand, 2 OTUs, each belonging to the genus Bacteroides
and Parabacteroides (phylum Bacteroidetes), were $8-fold lower
(P < 0.05) in the HF+10%M than in the HF group (Figure 1C).
Despite these changes observed in OTU-level taxa, relative
abundance of total bacterial genera in all the treatment groups
did not reach statistical significance (P > 0.05; Supplemental
Figure 2), suggesting that dietary treatments in this study selec-
tively modulate the microbiome at the OTU level.
Mango supplementation did not reduce body and tissue
weights, food intake, and body composition in HF diet-fed
mice. All HF-fed groups had ;25% higher caloric intake
than did the control group (P < 0.0001), and the mango-fed
mice had ;5% increase (P = 0.046) in caloric intake than the
HF group (Table 2). Body weights were similar before
initiation of the dietary treatments. However, after 12 wk of
treatment, there were significant differences in body weight,
with the HF+10%M group having 10% and 7% higher body
weight than the HF (P < 0.001) and HF+1%M (P = 0.006)
groups, respectively. The increase in fat mass and percentage
of body fat caused by an HF diet was not prevented by the

 HF+1%M diet (P = 0.61 and P = 0.92 for fat mass and percentage
of body fat, respectively) and further increased (17%, P = 0.004
and 7%, P = 0.027 for fat mass and percentage of body fat,
respectively) by the HF+10%M diet. The mango-fed groups had
similar relative tissue weights to the HF group.
Mango supplementation had modest effect on glucose
homeostasis in HF diet-fed mice. Similar to the results on
body composition, both doses of mango had no effect on glucose
homeostasis, as shown by the glucose AUC from the glucose
tolerance test (Table 3). However, plasma insulin was signifi-
cantly increased by 119%, 59%, and 54% in the HF+10%M
compared with control (P < 0.0001), HF (P = 0.001), and HF+1%
M (P = 0.002), respectively (Table 3). The HF+1%M group had
statistically similar plasma GLP1 to the control group (Table 3).
Plasma GIP concentrations were unaffected (P = 0.20) by dietary
treatments (Table 3).
In the pancreas, mango supplementation had no significant
effect on the protein expression of the GLP1R (P = 0.45; Figure
2A). However, we observed a 33% increase (P = 0.04) in GIPR in
the HF+1%M group compared with the HF group (Figure 2B).
Mango supplementation increased both fecal and cecal
SCFAs in HF diet-fed mice. SCFA analyses (Table 4) showed
the impact of mango supplementation in modulating cecal and
fecal SCFAs production. Compared with control, the HF diet
decreased cecal acetic (by 31%, P = 0.001), propionic (by 32%,
P < 0.0001), isobutyric (by 35%, P = 0.008), and isovaleric (by
26%, P = 0.001) acids but not n-butyric (P = 0.25) and n-valeric
acids (P = 0.19). Except for cecal propionic acid, the HF+10%M
but not HF+1%M brought these cecal SCFA to the level of
the control group. Similar results were seen with the fecal
SCFAs. The HF+10%M further increased fecal acetic acid (27%,
P = 0.036), n-butyric (6-fold, P < 0.0001), isovaleric (30%, P =
0.039), and n-valeric acids (3-fold, P < 0.0001) relative to the
control group. Unlike the cecal SCFAs, HF+1%M significantly
increased both fecal n-butyric (P = 0.037) and n-valeric (P = 0.0006)
acids by $30% compared with the HF group.
Mango supplementation stimulated colonic Il10 gene
expression independent of Gpr43. Mango supplementation
had no significant impact on ileal and colonic mRNA expression
of the SCFA receptor, Gpr43, and the inflammatory peptide Il1b

 and Il6 (Figure 3A, B). Colonic mRNA expression of Il10 was
significantly increased in the HF+1%M (by 70%, P = 0.021) and
HF+10%M (by 59%, P = 0.048) compared with the HF group,
an effect that was not observed in the ileum (Figure 3A, B).
Mango supplementation had modest effects on both
plasma and liver lipids in high fat diet-fed mice. Plasma
total- and non-HDL cholesterol was elevated because of HF
feeding, and mango had no reducing effect (Table 5). No
significant change was observed with mango supplementation
on plasma TGs (P = 0.12) and plasma nonesterified fatty acids
(P = 0.10) (Table 5). The HF and mango supplemented groups
had a 2-fold increase in liver TG compared with the control
(P < 0.05). Finally, mango supplementation had no effect on
plasma adipokines.
Discussion
The present study investigated the effects of freeze-dried mango
supplementation together with HF diet on gut microbiota. Our
findings revealed that mango supplementation in HF diet-fed
mice prevented the loss of beneficial gut bacteria, specifically
Bifidobacteria, Akkermansia, and Aldercrutzia, without decreas-
ing body weight or fat accumulation. This study also demon-
strates a mango-mediated modulation of SCFA production and
gut inflammation.
Several studies in humans and rodent models have suggested
that specific gut bacterial changes may play a role in the de-
velopment of obesity and T2D. For example, Bifidobacteria has
been reported to be lower in obese (33) and T2D subjects (34).
Similar results have been attributed with the mucin degrader A.
muciniphila in a mouse model of diet-induced obesity and T2D
(35). In this study, changes in OTU-level taxa in the gut bacteria
showed that mango supplementation in HF diet fed mice
prevented a substantial loss of beneficial bacteria, including
Bifidobacteria and Akkermansia, with the HF+10%M being
the most bacterioprotective. Furthermore, to our knowledge this
is the first study to show the ability of HF+10%M at increasing
the abundance of the genus Aldercreutzia despite HF feeding.
Aldercreutzia is a genus characterized in 2008 capable of pro-
ducing equol, an antioxidant from dietary isoflavonoids (36).
Thus, it may be interesting to investigate the possible impact of
mango on equol production and its potential physiological
benefits, because mango fruit is a good source of various poly-
phenols (16, 37).
Although mango supplementation prevented the loss of
beneficial gut bacteria caused by HF feeding similar to prebiotics
(8), this did not translate into a prevention of weight gain or
improved glucose tolerance and lipid profile. It is noteworthy
that although the HF+10%M was the most effective in preventing
the loss of beneficial bacteria caused by HF diet, these mice had
the highest body weight. The slightly higher caloric intake in the

Mango modulates gut microbial dysbiosis

 HF+10%M may have contributed to their higher body weight.
Additionally, the increase in body weight of the HF+10%M
group may be due to some species from the genus Ruminococcus,
which have been reported to possess strong energy-harvesting
capabilities from starch and cellulolytic fibers in the colon (38)
and made available to the host. However, based on our study
design, we could not differentiate the effects of caloric intake
and changes in Ruminococcus populations on body weight.
Moreover, some studies have also reported a failure of prebiotic
feeding in preventing weight gain despite a dose-dependent in-
crease in Bifidobacteria (39, 40). Results from the present study
and others (39, 40) suggest that bacterial changes at least at the
genus level may not be the only important factor modulating
weight gain and fat mass increase. Therefore, metagenomic
approaches such as shotgun sequencing that provide informa-
tion on genes that are affected within the gut microbial genome
(41) may provide insight to understanding the link between
the effect of mango on gut microbial changes and weight
gain. Nonetheless, this study provided evidence that mango
supplementation modulated beneficial changes in the gut micro-
biota in HF-fed mice, which may be important for gut homeostasis.
Prebiotic feeding modulates the gut microbiome and promotes
the production of SCFAs that have been shown to have various
physiological roles (8, 9). We show in this study that mango
supplementation not only modulated gut bacteria but also stim-
ulated an increase in both fecal and cecal SCFAs, suggesting an
increase in bacterial fermentation. In agreement with the results
on bacterial modulation, the HF+10%M had the most SCFA-
stimulatory effect as demonstrated by a significant increase in
both cecal and fecal acetic and butyric acids compared with the
HF group. However, this is speculative because one has to
consider the differences in caloric intake between the groups
when interpreting this result.
Butyrate is the preferred energy source for gut epithelial cells,
especially for colonocyte proliferation, making it a vital substrate
for colonic health (8, 9). Moreover, butyrate promotes mucosal
tolerance to endogenous bacteria and other stimuli via the extra-
thymic differentiation of T cells in the colon into IL10-producing

 T cells (8, 9, 42). In agreement with increased butyrate production
due to mango supplementation, enhanced gene expression of the
anti-inflammatory cytokine Il10 was observed in the colon of
both mango-supplemented groups compared with the HF group.
Because mango supplementation had no significant effect on the
SCFA receptor GPR43, future studies should investigate the effect
of mango on the expression of other SCFA receptors specific for
individual SCFA. Nonetheless, mango supplementation exerts
gut anti-inflammatory effects possibly via an increase in SCFAs,
which may be important in ameliorating gut mucosal intolerance
induced by HF diet.
To determine the effects of mango on glucose homeostasis,
we assessed plasma concentrations of the incretins GLP1 and
GIP, which increase insulin secretion and glucose sensitivity as
well as enhance proliferation of b-cells via the enteroinsular axis
(43, 44). We observed a modest increase in plasma GLP1 in the
HF+10%M group without any effect on GIP. This was accom-
panied by a concomitant increase in plasma insulin. This is in
agreement with a previous study that showed an increase in
plasma insulin in a GLP1-dependent manner in oligofructose-
supplemented mice (45). In contrast to the data on plasma
incretin, we observed a modest increase in the pancreatic
expression of the GIP receptor but not the GLP1 receptor in
the HF+10%M group. Two factors may have contributed to
this contrasting result. First, is the ability of the enteroinsular
axis to compensate for GLP1 inaction by upregulating the
GIP-insulin axis, as shown in GLP1R2/2 mice (46). However,
mango supplementation possibly had no effect on plasma glucose
because the enteroinsular axis requires the concerted action of
both GLP1 and GIP to maintain glucose homeostasis (44). A
second reason may have been our inability to determine the
protein concentrations of these receptors on b-islets as against
the whole pancreas, which is a limitation of our study. However,
our data suggest that mango may be effective in improving insulin
secretion by possible stimulation of the enteroinsular axis,
although this concept needs to be further explored.
Our study has several limitations including the small sample
size for the microbiome analyses, group housing, use of only
male mice, and our inability to measure circulating SCFAs to
better understand some of the systemic effects of mango seen in
this study. Additionally, the difference in caloric intake was not
accounted for in the interpretation of the relation between
microbiota and body weight data. Future studies should focus
on the contribution of microbial production of SCFAs caused by
mango on circulating SCFAs.
In conclusion, this study demonstrates that despite the in-
ability of mango to prevent body weight gain, fat accumulation,

 glucose intolerance, and dyslipidemia induced by an HF diet, it
modulates gut bacteria in favor of the beneficial Bifidobacteria
and Akkermansia and enhanced SCFA production. The results
also show that mango supplementation in mice fed an HF diet
improves insulin secretion possibly via the action of incretins and
enhanced anti-inflammatory cytokine production in the gut.
These results imply that mango supplementation in HF feeding
may be useful in modulating some of the adverse effects that
accompanies HF diet-induced obesity.
