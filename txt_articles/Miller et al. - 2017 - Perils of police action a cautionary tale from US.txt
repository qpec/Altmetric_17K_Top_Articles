ABSTRACT
Objective To count and characterise injuries resulting
from legal intervention by US law enforcement personnel
and injury ratios per 10 000 arrests or police stops, thus
expanding discussion of excessive force by police beyond
fatalities.
Design Ecological.
Population Those injured during US legal police
intervention as recorded in 2012 Vital Statistics mortality
census, 2012 Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project
nationwide inpatient and emergency department
samples, and two 2015 newspaper censuses of deaths.
Exposure 2012 and 2014 arrests from Federal Bureau
of Investigation data adjusted for non-reporting
jurisdictions; street stops and traffic stops that involved
vehicle or occupant searches, without arrest, from the
2011 Police Public Contact Survey (PPCS), with the
percentage breakdown by race computed from pooled
2005, 2008 and 2011 PPCS surveys due to small case
counts.
Results US police killed or injured an estimated 55 400
people in 2012 (95% CI 47 050 to 63 740 for cases
coded as police involved). Blacks, Native Americans and
Hispanics had higher stop/arrest rates per 10 000
population than white non-Hispanics and Asians. On
average, an estimated 1 in 291 stops/arrests resulted in
hospital-treated injury or death of a suspect or
bystander. Ratios of admitted and fatal injury due to
legal police intervention per 10 000 stops/arrests did not
differ significantly between racial/ethnic groups. Ratios
rose with age, and were higher for men than women.
Conclusions Healthcare administrative data sets can
inform public debate about injuries resulting from legal
police intervention. Excess per capita death rates among
blacks and youth at police hands are reflections of
excess exposure. International Classification of Diseases
legal intervention coding needs revision.
BACKGROUND
Of necessity, police sometimes injure or kill a felon
to protect the public or themselves. Police use of
undue force is an enduring tinderbox issue in
America.1–4 In the aftermath of the Civil W
ar,
adoption
of
the
14th
Amendment
to
the
Constitution and 18 US Code Sections 241 and
242 and 42 US Code Section 1983 provided pro-
tections against police use of excessive force or
other punishment without due process of law.
A unanimous US Supreme Court affirmed the
applicability of these protections to the police-
abetted murder of civil rights workers Schwerner,
Chaney and Goodman in Mississippi in 1964.5
Police instructors often teach officers about force
continuums where police response progressively
adjusts to match the changing level of suspect
resistance.6–8
Some
have
started
teaching
de-escalation techniques.9
Legal protections and training, however, cannot
prevent every abuse of power or police loss of
control out of anger or fear. Recently, US press and
public
outcry
protested
police
shootings
of
unarmed citizens and potentially negligent deaths
in police custody.10 Discussion has focused almost
exclusively on fatalities, driven by Federal Bureau
of Investigation (FBI)11 statistics on deaths due to
legal intervention by law enforcement personnel
(hereafter called legal police intervention), and by
newspaper-compiled censuses that reveal the FBI
reports omit half the fatalities.12 13 Periodic Police
Public Contact Surveys (PPCS) also find that blacks
are more likely than whites or Hispanics to experi-
ence physical force during a police-initiated stop.14
Vital
statistics
and
healthcare
claims
administrative
data
sets
contain
a
wealth
of
untapped information about the extent and nature
of suspect/bystander injury resulting from legal
police intervention. The International Classification
of Diseases (ICD), 9th and 10th revisions, define
legal intervention as ‘injuries inflicted by the police
or other law-enforcing agents … in the course of
arresting or attempting to arrest lawbreakers, sup-
pressing disturbances, maintaining order, and other
legal actions’. Some of these injuries involve undue
force.
This article uses ICD-coded national data to close
information gaps. It estimates non-fatal injuries
resulting from legal police intervention. It adds
insights by comparing injuries from legal police
intervention versus assault and using police arrest
and stop counts as denominators to compute injury
ratios.
METHODS
W
e used SAS V
.9.4 to analyse 2012 unit record data
on non-fatal injury from the Healthcare Cost and
Utilization Project (HCUP) Nationwide Inpatient
Sample
(NIS)
and
Nationwide
Emergency
Department Sample (NEDS).15 16 W
e extracted and
cleaned injury cases from NIS and NEDS following
published procedures,17 and coded the injuries by
body region and by Abbreviated Injury Severity
threat to life using ICDmap90 software.18 Legal
police intervention cases were identified by ICD,
9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD9-CM)
external cause codes E970–E977. To identify taser
injuries, we searched for an electroshock diagnosis
in the case (ICD9-CM diagnosis 994.8). W
e esti-
mated lifetime medical costs for each case using
methods
and

System) model.19 Unlike ICD10, WISQARS non-fatal data20
code intent separately from mechanism. Multiyear WISQARS
counts had wide CIs and were too thin to provide stable esti-
mates by demographics or for many mechanisms. They did
yield insight into mechanisms where the ICD10-CM coding
system that replaced ICD9–CM in 2015 inappropriately lacks
legal police intervention codes.
Fatalities
Deaths from legal police intervention are underidentified or
undercounted in US Vital Statistics, FBI Supplemental Homicide
Reports, and Bureau of Justice Statistics Arrest-Related Deaths
programme data.21–24 A modified capture-recapture modelling
approach suggested each captured 46–49% of these fatalities,21 24
while comparisons with National Violent Death Reporting
System (NVDRS) data for 16 states suggested a 48–58%
capture.24 The Washington Post used daily press searches and sup-
plemental crowdsourcing to track US firearm deaths due to police
action during 2015, verifying and detailing each identified
death.12 The Guardian25 compiled a similar list that added non-
firearm deaths, as well as deaths in custody and deaths in crashes
where police vehicles were at fault.13 Consistent with the capture-
recapture models, both found about twice as many legal police
intervention incidents as the three national reporting systems.
Several epidemiological studies found systematically searched
newspaper accounts a credible injury data source.26–30 W
e there-
fore relied primarily on homicide estimates by demographic
group from the Guardian data,25 excluding 41 deaths in custody
(primarily cardiovascular or other health crises) and 33 in
crashes. For half of the 24 cases with missing demographic data,
we back-filled this information from the Washington Post listing.
Demographic tabulations
W
e tabulated data by victim age group, sex, race and Hispanic
ethnicity, rurality, mechanism (eg, firearm), and, for hospital
admissions, by alcohol and drug involvement of the person
injured. All tables were run in SAS
V
.9.4., applying sample
weights to the HCUP data, which are public use samples of
approximately 20% of all US discharges.
Data deficits limited our analysis of race-ethnicity. NEDS
cannot supply nationally representative race-ethnicity estimates
because many states do not either identify race and ethnicity or
collect emergency department (ED) data centrally. W
e therefore
restricted
the
race-ethnicity
analysis
to
fatal
and
hospital-admitted injuries.
Denominators
As denominators for producing injury ratios, we used the sum
of FBI-tabulated arrest data, adjusted for non-reporting,31 and
2011 PPCS-based national estimates (which we computed using
STATA V
.11) of police street stops without arrest and of traffic
stops where a person or vehicle was searched but the person
stopped was not arrested.32 In 2012, FBI arrest data largely
excluded Alabama, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois
(except Chicago and Rockford) and New York City, and lacked
demographic detail for Florida. Online search provided arrest
data that we manually added for three of these jurisdictions:
Hawaii,33 Alabama34 and New York City.35 36 W
e adjusted the
remaining FBI-reported data to US estimates under the assump-
tion that arrest rates by region for the 82% of the US population
covered by the FBI data and our supplements were representa-
tive of arrest rates in those regions in frequency and demograph-
ics. The FBI only began collecting Hispanic origin in 2013
arrest data, with reporting much more complete in 2014 than
2013. W
e supplemented the 2014 data11 with a racial breakdown
for New Y
ork City.37
38 Our analyses classified all minority
Hispanics (eg, five of the deceased) by their minority race. W
e
assumed white Hispanics would constitute the same 28.6% of
arrested whites in 2012 as in 2014. Although we used 2011 stop
counts, because 2011 PPCS data were sparse for some racial
groups, we distributed them using an average percentage break-
down by race that we computed from pooled 2005, 2008 and
2011 surveys.32 39 T
o test significance of ratio differences, we
computed pairwise bivariate CIs between related demographic
categories (eg, male vs female).
RESULTS
The Guardian25 counted 1069 deaths from police intervention
during 2015, including 1015 by firearms. By comparison, the
Washington Post40 firearm death count was 990 and Bureau of
Labor Statistics capture-recapture modelling estimated annual
deaths due to legal police intervention averaged 928 in 2003–
2009 and 2011.21
In 2012, an estimated 55 400 people were killed or hospital-
treated in legal police intervention incidents (table 1, 95% CI
47 050 to 63 740). About 2% (1063) suffered fatal injuries, 5%
(2665, 95% CI 2386 to 2944) were hospital-admitted but sur-
vived, and the remainder (51 678, 95% CI 43 330 to 60 116)
were treated in the ED and released. Firearms accounted for
95% of fatalities and 23% of hospital admissions. Virtually all
other fatalities involved electromuscular disruption by tasers,
with most of these deaths not immediate. Of more than 1700

 taser-involved incidents, an estimated 65 resulted in hospital
admission and 48 were
lethal.
Medicolegal investigations,
however, concluded that the large majority of these deaths were
not caused by the taser. A 2011 blue-ribbon medical panel
review of medicolegal findings on deaths after electromuscular
disruption
suggests
those
determinations
probably
were
accurate.41
Police use of tear gas, mace or pepper spray rarely resulted in
hospital admission. The large majority of non-fatal injuries
stemmed from blows or blunt objects. Cases involving sharp
objects generally would involve police wounding someone while
seizing his or her weapon. Because the ICD lacks an appropriate
cause code, these figures exclude both people bitten by police
dogs, an estimated 4200 people annually (95% CI, 2000 to
6500) according to 2010–2013 WISQARS online data, and
injuries by mechanisms where WISQARS could not provide
stable counts. WISQARS data also suggested HCUP might be
underascertaining struck by/against injuries, but the WISQARS
sample includes just 66 hospitals.
Estimated lifetime medical costs for injuries from legal police
intervention in 2012 totalled $231 million (2012 dollars, not
tabulated). Modelled lifetime medical costs averaged $9550 for
a fatality, $36 550 for an admitted survivor and $2390 for a
patient treated in the ED and released.
In every age group, the estimated probability of hospital
admission among legal police intervention injuries (5.0%) was
lower than among other assault injuries (7.5%, not tabulated) in
2012. The AIS threat-to-life profile for legal police intervention
was
lower
than
for
assaults.
Among
patients
coded
as
hospital-admitted survivors of legal police intervention, 43%
faced only a minor threat to life (AIS-1) and 23% a moderate
threat (AIS-2). Hospital admissions for assault and legal police
intervention, however, had similar injury profiles and virtually
identical modelled lifetime medical costs per case. Gunshot
wounds were significantly more likely to be lethal if they
resulted from legal police intervention than from assault (40%
vs 26%).
Among patients coded as hospital-admitted survivors of legal
police intervention in 2012, 49% tested positive for alcohol,
drugs or both (not tabulated). The remainder either was not
tested or tested negative.
Exposure and ratios of injury to exposure
As table 2 shows, in 2012, arrests accounted for an estimated
12.3 million (76%) police interventions with a substantial
potential for violence, street stops for 2.8 million (18%) and
traffic stops involving searches for 1.0 million (6%). The people
who were least likely to be arrested when stopped were over age
65 years, Asian/Pacific Islander or living in non-metropolitan
areas. Those with the highest arrest rates per 10 000 population
were ages 15–29 years, black or Native American.
Table 3 provides demographic breakdowns of injury counts
and ratios per 10 000 police stops/arrests. The differences in
fatal plus non-fatal injury ratios by sex and by age group are sig-
nificant at the 95% confidence level. An estimated 1 in every
291 stops/arrests resulted in a death or medically treated injury
of the suspect or bystander, a ratio of 34 per 10 000 stops/
arrests. The coding does not differentiate bystanders from sus-
pects. The male injury ratio per 10 000 stops/arrests was more
than twice the female ratio, with even larger differentials for
hospital-admitted and especially for fatal injuries. The estimated
injury ratio rose initially with age, peaked at ages 30–44 years,
then declined. The estimated hospital-admitted injury ratio rose
steadily with age, while the estimated fatality ratio rose through
age 30 years, then plateaued. Those aged 65 years and over had
the highest probability of dying if injured during a stop/arrest.
The injury ratio was almost three times as high in metropolitan
as in non-metropolitan counties.
Both estimated hospital-admitted and fatal injury ratios per
10 000 stops/arrests did not differ significantly between racial/
ethnic
groups.
The
low
hospitalisation
ratio
for
Native
Americans suggests that HCUP coding of this racial group is
incomplete, with many mixed race individuals probably folded
into Other Race.
Uncertainty of the estimates
The estimates reported here are far from exact. The non-fatal
incident counts are constrained by identification error resulting
from faulty cause coding, but SEs for these HCUP counts as
coded are just 5–8% of the mean. Our denominator estimates
of arrests and stops without arrest, however, have wide uncer-
tainty ranges. SEs for the PPCS estimates in table 2 are about
10% of the mean for estimates above 1 000 000 but rise to 30%
of the mean for estimates around 100 000.32 W
orse, we can
only guess at the uncertainty in the arrest count because that
uncertainty results from (1) lack of reporting by some jurisdic-
tions, even entire states, with estimating their data unavoidably
requiring the questionable assumption that their arrest rates by
demographics are similar to rates in jurisdictions that chose to
report, and (2) an unknown amount of undercounting by some
jurisdictions that did report.42
DISCUSSION
On average, an estimated 34 people were killed or medically
treated for injury by law enforcement per 10 000 stops/arrests.
That ratio is surprisingly consistent by race/ethnicity. Blacks have
high arrest and stop rates,43 44 and per capita are much more
likely than whites to die at the hands of police.40 However,
when blacks are stopped or arrested, they are no more likely
than whites to be injured or die during that incident.
Consistent with our findings, simulation studies find police
are no more likely to fire on unarmed blacks than unarmed
whites,45 and high rates of black speeding citations per capita
result from high violation rates.46–48 A systematic review identi-
fied 10 studies that found suspect race/ethnicity did not predict
use of force or its escalation.6 However, one study found blacks
were more likely than whites to face force during compliance
checks.7 The PPCS survey also found that blacks were more
likely to experience physical force and to perceive the threat of
force during a stop, although few respondents actually were
injured by the force applied.14 The large majority of incidents
that those stopped perceived as undue force was stops where
officers shouted at or threatened people, presumably to deter
resistance.
Frequent police stops of young men have caused many black
and some Hispanic mothers to teach their sons where to put
their hands if approached by an officer, how to move and not
move, to ask permission before reaching for their wallet, and to
respond to police rudeness with respect.49 Those talks may have
protective effects.
High severity among the elderly
The high hospital admission and death ratios among the injured
elderly are consistent with their broader injury patterns.50 They
may result from brittle bones that are vulnerable in a police
scuffle. Some deaths also may represent suicidal situations where
someone deliberately forces an officer to pull the trigger or an
officer acts to stop a domestic murder-suicide.12 More research

 clearly is needed on police handling of elderly stops/arrests, and
on why they often lead to serious injury or death.
Judicious use of force
A core police role has long been considered judicious but not
undue use of psychological and physical force to maintain
order.4 51–54 Police also are trained to survive. The statistics
suggest that their training is largely protective, but violence
occasionally escalates.55 W
e found that in 2012, legal police
intervention resulted in an estimated 54 300 people being med-
ically treated for non-fatal injury and 1000 deaths. During 2012
an estimated 67 000 law enforcement personnel were assaulted,
with an estimated 18 600 medically treated for injury and 48
killed31 (FBI, 2012, tables 35 and 76, adjusted to account for
non-reporting jurisdictions).
Except in firearm incidents, injuries from legal police inter-
vention posed a lower threat to life compared with medically
treated assault injuries. This finding suggests the police usually

 were not out of control when they physically confronted a
suspect. The Washington Post census of people killed by police
estimated 74 per cent of victims were actively shooting at,
aiming weapons at, or (sometimes unarmed) attacking the
police.40 Still, 1 in 11 people who died due to law enforcement
action in 2015 were unarmed. As case studies indicate,56 steps
such as community-oriented policing, body cameras and inci-
dent investigation using surveillance methods drawn from public
health may de-escalate the violence.
Problems with administrative data coding and multistate
analyses of firearm homicide
Counts of Vital Statistics firearm mortality from legal police
intervention are undercounts, as the newspaper enumerations
showed. Vital Statistics legal police intervention appropriately
excluded cases where police had been convicted, or remained
under investigation, for use of excessive force (coded, respect-
ively, as homicide and undetermined intent). They also failed to
code police involvement in an estimated 450 shootings annually.
If those deaths incorrectly were registered as homicides, they
would artificially inflate firearm homicide counts by 4%. Since
misreporting rates vary widely between states,21 and may be
substantially lower in NVDRS states, this problem may have
skewed all recent cross-sectional time series analyses of firearm
homicides. Research is urgently needed to determine the intent
logged for these firearm deaths, including extending the recent
capture-recapture
modelling
effort21
to
incorporate
Vital
Statistics data.
Our taser counts are tenuous because neither morbidity nor
mortality coding assigns a code exclusively to taser. WISQARS
suggests legal police intervention was not codable for perhaps
10 000 injuries, primarily from dog bites, falls or foreign
bodies. Consistent with that estimate, dog bites accounted for
one-eighth of all reported injuries from legal police intervention
in Miami-Dade county, Florida and Richland county, South
Carolina.57 The injury coding also leaves ambiguities in the
unknown number of cases where police only inflicted a portion
of the person’s injuries. For example, if police broke up a fight
by tasering a brawler who already had suffered a knife wound
and a broken nose, the medical record would simply catalogue
the electroshock and physical injuries, and report that they
occurred in a legal police intervention incident.
Other limitations
The available arrest data are incomplete, especially information
about Hispanic origin. This deficit forces us to make the imper-
fect assumption that available data are representative. Similarly,
the sample is thin on the racial distribution of traffic stops, so
the Asian/Pacific Islander and Native American estimates are
unstable. ED data were not coded by race, and the coding of
Native Americans was suspect in the inpatient data.
CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Healthcare administrative data sets clearly have value in inform-
ing public debate about injuries resulting from law enforcement.
Drilling further into the data, especially with discharge censuses
rather than a national sample, linking discharges to unit record
data on arrests, and possibly applying capture-recapture model-
ling, would detail the picture sketched here. Available state data
urgently need to be tapped.
Given the frequency and potential lethality of these cases, the
US clinical modification to ICD10,58 and ideally ICD10 itself,
should add a code for legal intervention by taser. Legal interven-
tion also should be a codable intent for dog bites, human bites,
falls (as the PPCS finds the most common physical contact with
police is a push), foreign bodies and transport.
FBI arrest data are incomplete due to late or incomplete
police department reporting or refusal to report. Using local
data posted to the internet, we were able to add unreported
data from Alabama, Hawaii and New York City, and saw indica-
tions that the District of Columbia had the missing data in its
information system. To support accurate research, on injury risk
during arrest and on number of people arrested, we urge man-
datory reporting of arrests to the FBI. Moreover, we strongly
suggest that the FBI update its arrest data tables a year after the
original closing date, in order to incorporate reports received
after its deadline.
Given a national history of racism, the excess per capita death
rate of blacks from US police action rightly concerns policy ana-
lysts, advocates and the press. The excess appears to reflect
exposure. Blacks are arrested more often than whites, and youth
more often than the elderly. However, blacks are not more
likely than non-Hispanic whites to be killed or injured during a
stop/arrest, and youth have the lowest injury ratios. Ratios aside,
even one person unnecessarily killed or injured by the police is
one too many, and every racial/ethnic group has mourned losses
from undue force. As the US struggles to reduce citizen injuries
during police contacts, it would seem prudent to train at-risk
groups about appropriate behaviour during police stops.
What is already known on this subject?
▸ Minorities have a higher chance of being stopped by police,
arrested and being killed by police than non-Hispanic
whites.
▸ Untapped health data describe non-fatal injuries inflicted
during legal intervention by police.
▸ Injury risk for those stopped or arrested by police has not
been analysed.
What this study adds?
▸ During legal interventions in 2012, US police fatally injured 1000
people, with an estimated 54 300 surviving hospital-treated
injuries.
▸ Estimated injury risk was 1 per 291 stops/arrests.
▸ While minorities were more likely to be stopped/arrested by
police, the probability of being killed/injured during a stop/
arrest did not vary by race.
