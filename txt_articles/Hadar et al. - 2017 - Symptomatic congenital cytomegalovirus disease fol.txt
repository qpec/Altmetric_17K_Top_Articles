Abstract
Background: Scarce data exist about screening, diagnosis and prognosis of non-primary Cytomegalovirus (CMV)
during pregnancy. We aimed to examine antenatal diagnosis of maternal non-primary CMV infection and to
identify risk factors for congenial CMV disease.
Methods: Retrospective cohort of 107 neonates with congenital symptomatic CMV infection, following either
primary (n = 95) or non-primary (n = 12) maternal CMV infection. We compared the groups for the manifestations
and severity of congenial CMV disease, as well as for possible factors associated with the risk of developing CMV
related infant morbidity.
Results: Disease severity is not similar in affected newborns, with a higher incidence of abnormal brain sonographic
findings, following primary versus non-primary maternal CMV infection (76.8% vs. 8.3%, p < .001). Symptomatic congenital
CMV disease following a non-primary infection is more frequent if gestational hypertensive disorders and/or gestational
diabetes mellitus have ensued during pregnancy (33.3% vs. 9.9%, p <0.038), as well as if any medications were taken
throughout gestation (50% vs. 16.8%, p <0.016). CMV-IgM demonstrates a low detection rate for non-primary maternal
infection during pregnancy compared to primary infection (25% vs. 75.8%, p = 0.0008).
Conclusion: Non-primary maternal CMV infection has an impact on the neonate. Although not readily diagnosed during
pregnancy, knowledge of risk factors may aid in raising clinical suspicion.

Background
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a common congenital infection,
diagnosed among 0.3-2% of newborns [1]. The prevalence
and severity of congenital CMV infection varies according
to the timing of infection, the presence of preexisting im-
munity and other contributing factors [2]. Secondary, or
non-primary, maternal CMV infection occurs when prior
maternal immunity exists. It can emerge following latent
CMV reactivation or by a new viral strain reinfection [3].
Following a non-primary maternal infection the vertical
transmission rate of CMV is reported to be 0.2-1% [4] and
congenital symptomatic disease is diagnosed in less than
1%,
among
fetuses
infected
in-utero
[5].
Moreover,
congenital CMV has a clinical spectrum ranging from
asymptomatic infection to a severe disease, including mul-
tiple possible manifestations of petechiae, jaundice, hepa-
titis,
chorioretinitis,
microcephaly,
growth
restriction,
hepatosplenomegaly; as well as short and long term sque-
lae of hearing loss and neurodevelopmental deficits [6]. It
is debatable whether prior immunity infers complete or
partial protection against CMV related morbidity [7, 8],
while others have reported that disease manifestations, se-
verity and long term prognosis are similar between primary
and non-primary infections [9–11].
The rate of congenital infection following non-primary
maternal CMV infection is extremely low compared to
the incidence subsequent to primary infection [12, 13].
Nevertheless, non-primary maternal CMV infection has
been previously reported as a cause of congenital symp-
tomatic disease [14, 15]. In the United States, only 25%

 of infants with congenital CMV infection were attributable
to primary maternal infection, while 75% were born to
mothers with non-primary infections, following either re-
activation or reinfection with different viral strains [16].
Moreover, in a recent population-based prediction model,
it was estimated that non-primary infections account for
the majority of CMV-related hearing losses [17].
Paucity of reports exist on appropriate tools to screen
and diagnose non-primary gestational CMV and to de-
tect women who are at risk for delivering CMV symp-
tomatic
infants,
following
a
non-primary
infection.
Therefore, we aimed to examine the antenatal diagnosis
of maternal non-primary CMV infection and to identify
antenatal risk factors for congenial symptomatic CMV
among neonates.
Methods
We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all neo-
nates that were referred for follow up due to congenital
CMV infection. The study was approved by the Rabin
medical center institutional review board.
Study population
The study population included all neonates born from
January 2006 to December 2013, who were referred for
follow up due to congenital symptomatic CMV infec-
tion. The study was conducted at the Rabin medical cen-
ter, which is a university-affiliated, tertiary medical
center which serves as a referral center for both high
risk pregnancies (Helen Schneider Hospital for Women)
and pediatric patients (Schneider Children’s Medical
Center of Israel).
Eligibility criteria for the study included all the new-
borns with a positive urinary culture or PCR for CMV,
taken shortly after birth and up to two weeks following
delivery. Those with insufficient data as to antenatal
and/or neonatal care and serological data were excluded
from the study, as well as those newborns with a con-
genital asymptomatic infection. The included population
was sub-divided to symptomatic neonates following ei-
ther non-primary maternal CMV infection (study group)
versus primary infection (control group).
Symptomatic newborns included those with any one
of the following symptoms or signs - small for gesta-
tional age (SGA, defined as birthweight below the 3rd
percentile for gestational age at delivery), chorioretinitis,
abnormal brain sonography (defined as the presence of
any of the following: calcification, periventricular hypere-
cogenicity, ventriculomegaly, subependymal cysts and
lenticular-striated
vasculopathy
(LSV)),
microcephaly
(defined as age appropriate head circumference below
two standard deviations), pathological audio screening,
sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) detected by abnormal
brainstem-evoked response audiometry test (BERA) and
that the treating physician has decided to start antiviral
treatment for any one of the above mentioned signs and
symptoms.
Maternal and neonatal follow up
The diagnosis of primary maternal CMV infection was
established according to the following criteria: women
who seroconvert from negative to positive CMV-IgG
during pregnancy; or if prior serology for CMV was not
available - low CMV-IgG avidity and positive specific
CMV-IgM were also considered diagnostic for primary
maternal CMV infection. Non-primary CMV infection
was considered when pre-gestational maternal immunity
was established from previous laboratory results, i.e.
positive CMV-IgG documented prior to pregnancy.
Mothers who were diagnosed during pregnancy with
gestational CMV infection were offered prenatal diagno-
sis with amniocentesis. The procedure was performed
beyond 21 completed weeks of gestation and at least
7 weeks after the presumed timing of maternal CMV in-
fection. Following amniocentesis, if fetal infection was
documented and pregnancy was not terminated, serial
ultrasound (US) assessments were recommended every
3–4 weeks and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was
suggested at 32–34 weeks. Fetal imaging results - by either
MRI or US - were considered as abnormal, an related to
CMV, if they included any one of the following findings:
fetal growth restriction (defined as estimated fetal weight
below the 3rdpercentile for gestational age), ventriculome-
galy, microcephaly, central nervous system (CNS) calcifica-
tion, periventricular hyperecogenicity, subependymal cysts,
increased white matter signal and abnormal gyration or
hyperechogenic bowel.
Congenital CMV infection in the newborn was estab-
lished by a CMV positive urinary shell vial culture or
PCR, preformed within 48 h after birth and up to 2 weeks
following delivery. Neonates with a positive culture under-
went a thorough evaluation, upon admission, comprised
of: BERA, ocular funduscopy, brain ultrasound and blood
work-up for complete blood count, liver enzymes and
bilirubin. CNS sonographic signs related to neonatal CMV
included: calcifications, periventricular hyperecogenicity,
ventriculomegaly, pseudocysts and LSV. Neonates diag-
nosed with CMV infection after birth were followed at
our clinic once a month until 3 months of age and every
3-6monthsthereafter. A full physical examination, includ-
ing neurological and developmental assessments, was per-
formed at each visit. Blood count was tested every other
week up to 3 months of age and then during subsequent
clinical visits. BERA was performed in the first month,
and thereafter at least twice in the first year of life, with
follow up periodic examinations every 6 months to age
2 years. Behavioral learning evaluation was preformed
every 6 months up to age 4.

 Data extraction and definitions
We extracted maternal, fetal and neonatal data from med-
ical charts, delivery records and computerized databases of
laboratory and imaging data. The extracted data for the
study included: maternal demographics, medical and ob-
stetrical history, maternal occupation (high risk occupations
for CMV exposure were defined as kindergarten teachers,
day care workers and medical professionals), pregnancy
complications (Hypertensive disorders, gestational diabetes,
preterm delivery prior to 37 weeks of gestation and mater-
nal febrile illness during pregnancy), use of medication
throughout pregnancy and delivery outcome (mode and
time of delivery, fetal gender, Apgar score and birthweight).
Laboratory and imaging data was also extracted, including:
complete maternal serologic data (IgG, IgM and IgG
avidity), liver enzyme testing, amniocentesis and imaging
(US and/or MRI) results for CMV obtained during preg-
nancy and neonatal follow up.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using the Statistical
Package for Social Science (SPSS, IBM software version
21.0, Chicago, IL, USA). Categorical variables were com-
pared using Fischer’s exact or Pearson Chi-square tests.
Continuous variables were analyzed by One Way Analysis
of Variance (ANOVA). A probability value below 0.05 was
considered significant.
Results
A total of 173 newborns with proven congenital CMV
infection were evaluated, of which six were excluded due
to lack of antenatal data and 60 due to a neonatal
asymptomatic infection. Therefore, 107 newborns with
symptomatic congenital CMV disease were available for
final analysis - 12 (11.2%) newborns were symptomatic
following non-primary CMV maternal infection (study
group) and 95 (88.8%) were affected following primary
CMV maternal infection (control group).
The manifestations of the congenital CMV disease
among the neonates, in each of the groups, are pre-
sented in Table 1. Our results demonstrate that symp-
tomatic newborns following maternal non-primary CMV
infection were significantly less likely to present an ab-
normal brain sonography compared to neonates with
congenital CMV disease following primary CMV infec-
tion (8.3% vs. 76.8%, p < .001).
Maternal factors (Table 2)
Women giving birth to a symptomatic newborn, follow-
ing a non-primary CMV infection during pregnancy,
were more likely to have medical complications during
pregnancy (33.3% vs. 9.9%, p <0.038) and were more
likely to have used medications during pregnancy
(50% vs. 16.8%, p <0.016) compared to women delivering
after a primary CMV infection. Serological diagnosis of
maternal infection was established during pregnancy in
only 3 women among the non-primary infection sub-
group. We found that the likelihood of positive IgM-CMV
was significantly lower (25% vs. 75.8%, p = 0.0008) among
the non-primary subgroup compared to the primary sub-
group, respectively.

 Fetal factors (Table 3)
Mothers exposed to non-primary CMV infection were
less likely to perform amniocentesis than those with pri-
mary infection (16.7% vs. 49.5%, p = 0.035). Also, the
chance of positive CMV in amniotic fluid analysis
among fetuses exposed to non-primary CMV infections
was lower than those in the primary subgroup (0% vs.
89.4%. p = 0.018).
Discussion
Our study was a retrospective cohort analysis of 107
newborns, stratified according to preexisting maternal
immunity. Our main results indicate that disease mani-
festation and severity are not similar between groups;
antenatal risk factors for a congenital CMV disease fol-
lowing a non-primary infection include the occurrence
of pregnancy complications and the use of medication
during pregnancy; and that CMV-IgM demonstrates low
detection rate for non-primary maternal infection.
Previous studies have reported contradicting findings,
whether CMV following non-primary infection is associ-
ated with a higher or lower incidence [18, 19] and severity
[7–11] of congenital CMV. Boppana et al. [9], in a similarly
designed study to our own, compared 47 symptomatic ne-
onates - 12 following non-primary CMV and 35 following
primary CMV infection. They demonstrated similar rates
of CMV related symptoms (SGA, jaundice, hepatospleno-
megaly, microcephaly, chorioretinitis and abnormal hear-
ing screen) and comparable CMV disease severity among
the groups. Townsend et al. [10] and Ross et al. [11] have
shown, respectively, that hearing loss and overall long term
sequelae have similar incidence in primary and non-
primary CMV symptomatic newborns. Contradictory to
these reports, Fowler et al. [8], comparing 125 neonates
born following primary maternal infection vs. 64 neonates
born following non-primary infection demonstrated that
only those with primary infection were symptomatic at
birth – including jaundice, petechiae, hepatosplenomegaly,
SGA, microcephaly, hydranencephaky and death. Also, that
late onset handicaps and squelae were apparent among
25% of neonates born following primary infection, versus
only 8% in neonates of the non-primary CMV group. Our
study partly supports all these findings, as we demon-
strated similar rates of SGA, microcephaly, chorioretinitis,
pathological audio screening test and BERA. However, we
found higher rates of abnormal brain sonography in the
primary CMV group, a sign which has not been evaluated
specifically in previous studies.
The majority of current literature on the prediction of
symptomatic CMV disease among infected fetuses is fo-
cused on the timing of maternal infection during gesta-
tion and the presence of abnormal findings in fetal
imaging, as predictors of symptomatic congenital dis-
ease. Our study is the first to demonstrate that non-
sonographic antenatal factors may be associated with an
increased risk to deliver an affected newborn. Our re-
sults support the possibility that the occurrence of preg-
nancy complications - specifically hypertensive disorders
and gestational diabetes - as well as the use of chronic
medication during pregnancy is associated with an in-
creased risk of delivering a CMV symptomatic newborn,
following a non-primary CMV maternal infection. There
is paucity of data on antenatal risk factors for symptom-
atic disease, and no data focusing on the subgroup of
non-primary CMV. Boppana et al. [9], demonstrated no
difference among primary versus non-primary groups,
with regards to parity and the number of children of the
infected mothers. Others [20] have reported that young
age (below 20 years), non-white race and low-income
status are associated with an increased risk for delivering
a neonate exhibiting CMV related morbidity - however,
no distinction was made with regard to maternal im-
munity status during pregnancy in this study. In a previ-
ously
published
study
[21],
we
demonstrated
that
antenatal risk factors for CMV congenital disease follow-
ing primary maternal infection may include - young
maternal age and a high risk occupational exposure. Ac-
cordingly, we speculate that primary infection is related
to external factors, conferring a higher exposure risk of
the mother to new onset CMV infection, while a non-
primary infection is associated with internal factors, ex-
posing the mother to either reactivation or reinfection
with CMV. Although the mechanism for such an associ-
ation is unknown, we speculate that it is may be

 associated with some degree of interference to the im-
mune system, leading to higher maternal susceptibility
to latent viral reactivation. Although, for either primary
or non-primary infection, the final common pathway is a
higher viral load during gestation, allowing for greater
viral inoculums to reach the placenta and fetus, conse-
quently increasing the risk for symptoms at birth.
Serological diagnosis of non-primary CMV infection in
the mother is problematic. Due to the asymptomatic na-
ture of maternal CMV infection in the majority of cases,
clinical suspicion of CMV infection rarely rises. Mater-
nal CMV infection is usually diagnosed by routine
screening in sero-negative women or may be suspected
due to abnormal sonographic findings. In our cohort
maternal serology was examined for the presence of
CMV-IgM in only 6 cases. The trigger for serological
testing was due to either febrile illness (n = 1), suspicious
sonographic finding (n = 4) or routine testing (n = 1).
Among those 6 mothers, CMV-IgM was positive in only
half (50%). This rate was significantly lower than the rate
of positive CMV-IgM (75.8%) among mothers in the pri-
mary infection. The low rate of positive CMV-IgM
among mothers with non-primary CMV infection is sup-
ported by other small studies [22, 23]. Kyriazopoulou et
al. [22] studied 32 women immunized to CMV with nor-
mal pregnancy course and no suspicious ultrasound
findings. Although, none of the women had any sero-
logical evidence of maternal non-primary CMV infec-
tion, they detected 4 (12.5%) positive CMV results in
amniotic fluid or fetal blood sampling. In another study,
Zalel at al. [23] studied 6 pregnant women who were
referred due to abnormal sonographic findings, suggest-
ive of in-utero CMV related morbidity. All women were
exposed to CMV prior to pregnancy and none had sero-
logical evidence of non-primary infection at workup.
However, all women had positive CMV in amniotic fluid
analysis. These studies, in concordance with our current
study, demonstrate a low detection rate for non-primary
CMV infection by CMV-IgM testing.
A major strength of our study is that in contrast to other
studies, the immune status of all participating women was
known and ascertained by documented serological exami-
nations. Indeed, the study is limited due to its retrospective
nature, with a limited number of participants, especially in
the non-primary CMV group, where only symptomatic
newborns were referred for follow-up. Such a referral is
routinely recommended when suspected finding arise
during pregnancy or at the immediate postpartum period
due to abnormal sonographic findings, clinical findings and
abnormal audio screening tests - this may explain the high
rate of hearing loss in the study. Importantly, the primary
CMV infection group includes only newborns to mothers
who elected to continue their pregnancy despite proven in-
utero infection or alarming findings on prenatal imaging.
Due to lack of data we could not determine whether the
non-primary infection was a result of reactivation or re-
infection, both possible causes of congenital CMV [24], al-
though no data exist whether one causes more serious
morbidity than the other [7].
Conclusion
The true incidence and impact of recurrent maternal CMV
infection remains elusive, with questions as to risk factors,
screening and diagnosis. However, it seems that the inci-
dence of symptomatic non-primary infection is low and
somewhat limited to pregnancies complicated by maternal
morbidity. When such fetal-neonatal infection occurs, it
might be with less severe sequelae compared to neonates
following primary maternal infection. Our results bring to
focus the importance of sonographic follow up during
pregnancy, which may provide clues for the possibility of
congenital symptomatic CMV fetal infection. When such
relevant sonographic markers are detected, the absence of
presumed serological evidence (i.e. positive IGM), should
not prevent further diagnostic measures such as amniocen-
tesis and further fetal imaging such as a detailed targeted
sonography and MRI. This also raises the issue of newborn
routine screening as a major tool for prompt and timely
diagnosis of congenital CMV. Such early detection may
allow workup, treatment and future explorations to pre-
vent long term handicap. Undoubtedly, further large scale
studies are needed, focusing on prevention of non-primary
CMV among gravidas, fetal diagnosis during pregnancy
and screening for congenital CMV among neonates, as well
as possible interventions to prevent long term poor prog-
nosis among congenitally infected neonates.
