Background: Trauma care in England was re-organised in 2012 with ambulance bypass of local hospitals to newly
designated Major Trauma Centres (MTCs). There is still controversy about the optimal way to organise health se-
ries for patients suffering severe injury.
Methods: A longitudinal series of annual cross-sectional studies of care process and outcomes from April 2008 to
March 2017. Data was collected through the national clinical audit of major trauma care. The primary analysis
was carried out on the 110,863 patients admitted to 35 hospitals that were ‘consistent submitters’ throughout
the study period. The main outcome was longitudinal analysis of risk adjusted survival.
Findings: Major Trauma networks were associated with significant changes in (1) patient flow (with increased
numbers treated in Major Trauma Centres), (2) treatment systems (more consultant led care and more rapid im-
aging), (3) patient factors (an increase in older trauma), and (4) clinical care (new massive transfusion policies
and use of tranexamic acid). There were 10,247 (9.2%) deaths in the 110,863 patients with an ISS of 9 or more.
There were no changes in unadjusted mortality. The analysis of trends in risk adjusted survival for study hospitals
shows a 19% (95% CI 3%–36%) increase in the case mix adjusted odds of survival from severe injury over the 9-
year study period. Interrupted time series analysis showed a significant positive change in the slope after the in-
tervention time point of April 2012 (+0.08% excess survivors per quarter, p = 0.023), in other words an increase
of 0.08 more survivors per 100 patients every quarter.
Interpretation: A whole system national change was associated with significant improvements in both the care
process and outcomes of patients after severe injury.
Funding: This analysis was carried out independently and did not receive funding. The data collection for the na-
tional clinical audit was funded by subscriptions from participating hospitals.

1. Introduction
Trauma remains one of the commonest causes of death and disabil-
ity worldwide [1]. Evidence from Germany [2], Australia [3, 4] and the
USA [5, 6] shows that trauma care improves with rationalisation of
trauma systems with best results produced when care within a region
is provided by a network of hospitals with a Major Trauma Centre
(MTC) at the hub. In America, states with trauma systems have a 9%
lower crude mortality rate than states without organised systems of
trauma care [7], although there are many potential confounders. Using
risk adjustment for potential confounders, the introduction of a trauma
system in the Australian state of Victoria was associated with a relative
reduction in mortality of 38% over a five-year period (Adjusted Odds
Ratio = 0.62; 95% CI 0.48 to 0.80) [8].
In England, trauma is the commonest cause of death in those under
40 years, with survivors often suffering long-term disability [9]. The Na-
tional Audit Office estimates that there are 20,000 cases of major trauma
each year in England with 5400 deaths [10]. The NCEPOD 2007 report
“Trauma, who cares?” also identified serious failings in the organisation
of trauma care in England [11]. Since the inception of the National
Health Service (NHS) in 1948, the emergency care system had been
based upon the ambulance service transporting the patient to the

 nearest Accident and Emergency Department, irrespective of the capa-
bility of the hospital to provide resuscitation and definitive care. The
Trauma Audit and Research Network (TARN) had identified great vari-
ation in the standard of care in England and comparative studies
showed that the outcome following trauma did not meet the standards
of other countries [12]. The NCEPOD 2007 report suggested that almost
60% of major trauma patients received a standard of care that was less
than good practice with avoidable deaths still occurring. This led the Na-
tional Audit Office to recommend the development of regional trauma
networks in England.
Following on from this recommendation, the NHS reorganisation cre-
ated a series of Regional Networks. In England there are now 27 desig-
nated Major Trauma Centres: 11 for adults and children, 10 for adults
only, 5 for children only and 1 collaborative centre (a group of geograph-
ically close hospitals who collaborate to provide full MTC services). The
London network started in April 2010 and the Trauma Networks across
England started operating in April 2012. The additional services provided
by Trauma Networks are funded by a “Best Practice Tariff”, which is an
additional payment per patient of £1406 ($1887) for patients with an
ISS of 9 to 15, or £2819 ($3783) for patients with an ISS of 16 or more
(2018 prices). This is in addition to the usual patient funding and is
only payed to MTCs (there is no additional funding for TUs).
Previous studies of the effect of introduction of trauma systems have
looked at local or regional initiatives, usually based on local clinical en-
thusiasm or based on centres of excellence. This gives a difficulty in un-
derstanding the generalizability of the results as it is well known that
improved outcomes driven by enthusiasts may not be reproduced
when applied more widely. Previous work has often excluded the pa-
tients who were not identified in the trauma care system and therefore
did not go to a Major Trauma Centre (MTC) and who may have had
worse outcomes with treatment in units that had been ‘deskilled’ [13,
14]. The universal healthcare coverage provided by the NHS allows
study of comprehensive national trauma registry data to evaluate the
effects of the implementation of national regionalisation of trauma
care on both the process of care and patient mortality. The use of
TARN data to assess the impact of changes to the care of the severely in-
jured was recommended in 2010 by the NHS Clinical Advisory Groups
Report “Regional Networks for Major Trauma” and was planned as
part of the reorganisation of trauma care.
2. Methods
The study design and reporting followed the STROBE guidance for ob-
servational studies [15]. Longitudinal data was collected by the Trauma
Audit and Research Network (the national clinical audit for major trauma
care) using a consistent methodology before, during and after the
reorganisation of trauma care in England and North Wales. For this
study, anonymised data from patients presenting between 1st April
2008 and 31st March 2017 was collated for analysis. The UK Health
Research Authority Patient Information Advisory Group (PIAG) has
given approval (Section 20) for research using anonymised TARN data.
The TARN database includes patients of any age who sustain injury
resulting in: hospital admission N72 h, critical care admission, transfer
to a tertiary/specialist centre or death within 30 days. Isolated femoral
neck or single pubic ramus fracture in patients N65 years and simple
isolated injuries are excluded. After study inclusion, a dataset of pro-
spectively recorded variables covering demographics plus injury-
related physiological, investigation, treatment and outcome parameters
are collated using a standard web-based case record form by TARN hos-
pital audit co-ordinators. Injury descriptions from imaging, operative
and necropsy reports are submitted by TARN co-ordinators - all injuries
are coded centrally using the Abbreviated Injury Scale, this enables cal-
culation of the Injury Severity Score (ISS) [16]. Some patients meet
TARN inclusion criteria with injury combinations of low severity – for
example a simple zygomatic and closed forearm fracture (ISS = 8). It
is implausible that the re-organisation of trauma care would impact
on care or outcomes for these patients. Hence for this study TARN pa-
tients with an ISS b 9 were excluded. Patients subsequently transferred
to non-TARN participating hospitals were excluded from the analysis, as
outcome was unknown. Outcome in terms of survival or death was
based on the assessment at discharge or 30 days, whichever occurred
first. Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) was defined as patients with a head
region Abbreviated Injury Score (AIS) N 2 (i.e. abnormal CT brain scan
or a clinically open/base of skull fracture). All other patients were
regarded as not having sustained TBI.
Over the study period 98 English trauma receiving hospitals joined
TARN for the first time increasing membership from 91 hospitals in
2008/9 to 169 hospitals in 2016/17, including all designated MTCs and
Trauma Units. A subgroup of 35 hospitals with continuous TARN mem-
bership and patient submissions throughout the study period was iden-
tified and was defined as “consistent submitters” and the primary
analyses describing trends in case-mix, care processes and outcomes
were undertaken on this group.
It may be that the ‘constant submitter’ hospitals are different from
the rest of the hospitals in England and Wales as they are self-defined
by long term membership of the national trauma audit system. This
might introduce bias that would impair the generalisability of any con-
clusions (for example they may be more willing to engage in the
Trauma Network and so show more improvement than others, or they
may already have such good outcomes that Network formation did
not lead to change). We attempted to look for bias by repeating the
analysis using data from all hospitals in England and Wales rather
than just the ‘constant submitters’.
As missing values for Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) are known to bias
trauma outcome models [18], multiple imputations were performed
Research in context
Evidence before this study
There is a large but controversial literature on the effect of trauma
systems, as controlled trials are not possible. Previous studies
have been conducted on a local or regional level and most have
focused on selected major trauma centre patients, with associ-
ated high risk of bias.
Added value of this study
This is the first analysis of the effects on survival following the
introduction of systematic trauma care on a national basis in a
health system that provides universal healthcare coverage.
Trauma care reorganisation was associated with a significant,
19% increase in the odds of survival following major trauma in
the first 5 years after inception. This change continued to be
present in sensitivity analyses which explored potential bias from
missing data and changing patterns of data submission to the
registry.
Implications of all the available evidence
Observational studies are likely to be the highest form of evidence
available for healthcare planners to use as a basis for future
decisions about trauma care. The evidence suggests that the best
approach is re-organisation to create inclusive trauma networks
with tiered hospitals and ambulance service bypass to the most
appropriate centre.

 for missing GCS values (assuming that the mechanism of missingness is
at random). As missing data could also have caused bias we performed a
sensitivity analysis by repeating the analysis including and excluding
cases with missing data.
3. Analysis
The study size was determined by the number of eligible patients in-
cluded in the TARN database. Patient demographic features, injury char-
acteristics, patterns of care and crude mortality were described by year
of presentation. To define the changes in care that took place trends in
the yearly proportion of location of care and other categorical variables
were examined using Chi-squared test for trend. A two-sided p value of
b0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. As small changes
within such a large dataset give rise to ‘statistical significance’ only
changes that were considered by the authors to also have ‘clinical signif-
icance’ were highlighted in the text (all data were presented in the
tables).
To examine temporal trends in trauma outcome (mortality), the
standard logistic regression modelling approach used in trauma out-
come analysis [17] was employed. Survival to acute care discharge or
30 days (whichever is first) was used as the dependent variable, with
year of treatment as an independent variable, allowing calculation of
odds of survival for each financial year (1st April to 31st March) from
2009/10 to 2016/17 compared to the 2008/9 baseline. The effect of dif-
fering case mix between each year of attendance was adjusted for by
specifying potential confounders (those used in the established trauma
prognostic model) as covariates. The explanatory variables considered
were: admission GCS, injury severity score (ISS) [16], age and an age/
gender interaction, and comorbidity.
The primary analysis was performed on data from the group of ‘con-
sistently submitting’ hospitals. Results were reported as case-mix ad-
justed and unadjusted yearly odds of death, with 95% confidence
intervals, and plotted graphically. Further sensitivity analysis was con-
ducted on just the cases with complete data and cases from all hospitals.
The discrimination of logistic regression models was assessed using the
area under the receiving operator curve (AUROC).
To further characterise any changes in risk adjusted survival over the
study time period the quarterly W statistics were calculated for each
consecutive 3 month period from April of each year using the conven-
tional TARN method [19]. The W can be interpreted as the number of
excess survivors per 100 patients (observed – expected given case
mix). An interrupted time series analysis (ITS) around the introduction
of the trauma networks in April 2012/13 was performed using the quar-
terly W on aggregate data with autoregressive regression to allow for
autocorrelation. This technique can assess step changes in magnitude
as well as changes in secular trends of a specified variable with units
around a given point in time [20].
Statistical analyses were carried out in Stata version 14 (StataCorp,
College Station, USA). Missing GCS values were imputed by chained
equations implemented using the ICE Stata (StataCorp, College Station,
USA) procedure.
4. Results
The process of identification of eligible patients is shown in Fig. 1.
There were 20,605 (8.3%) deaths in the 248,234 patients with an ISS
of 9 or more with known outcome, 10,247 (9.2%) in the 110,863 pa-
tients from hospitals who were ‘consistent submitters’.
There were changes in the patient characteristics (case mix) from
08/09 to 16/17 (Table 1). The median age of the patients increased sig-
nificantly from 45 to 59 years (p = 0.0001), with the proportion of
major trauma patients aged 65 years and over almost doubling from
22% to 42% (p b 0.0001). The yearly proportion of male patients fell sig-
nificantly from 68% to 61% (p b 0.0001). With the increasing age over
the study period, the proportion of patients with a co-morbid condition
increased from 40% to 64% (p b 0.0001). The distribution of injuries
(proportion with TBI/extracranial injuries – not mutually exclusive –
at 35%/73%) and their median severity (median ISS = 16/median Emer-
gency Department arrival GCS = 15) have not significantly changed
over the study period. The annual proportion of patients injured by a
fall from less than 2 m in height has significantly increased from 32%
to 47% (p b 0.0001). The proportions injured by other mechanisms
have all reduced slightly over time but the change is not significant
within each sub-category. The annual number of major trauma patients
with an ISS N 8 presenting to these consistently submitting hospitals in-
creased 260% from 5338 to 19,197 over the study period, the increase
being most marked in those injured by low falls. Similar findings are ev-
ident in the sensitivity analysis of patients from all hospitals (Table 3).
There were changes in the process of care over time (Table 2).
Within the study sample of 35 consistently submitting hospitals, 15
(43%) were designated as Major Trauma Centres, which is higher than
the national proportion of 16% (27 out of 169). In these ‘consistently
submitting’ hospitals there was an increase in the proportion of patients
having a Major Trauma Centre as an initial (53% to 72% p b 0.0001), or
final (73% to 82% p b 0.0001) care destination. There has been an in-
crease in time from injury to arrival at the first hospital (+30 min, p b
0.0001). The proportion of patients having CT imaging has increased
from 50% to 72% (p b 0.0001).
Of particular note is the 36.5% absolute increase in consultant atten-
dance as trauma team leader (29% to 63% p b 0.0001) which was a key
change made during trauma system reorganisation. Pre-hospital intu-
bation is uncommon (overall 0.3%), and intubation rates in the ED
have decreased from 13.6% to 11% (p b 0.0001). The administration of
tranexamic acid in patients with haemorrhage requiring transfusion
within 6 h of admission has significantly increased from near zero to
90% in 2016/17 (p b 0.0001). Median time to surgery (all types) has in-
creased by 4 h (18 h to 22 h p b 0.0001). There has been a reduction in
the proportion of patients requiring critical care (31% to 24% p b 0.0001)
and in the median length of stay on critical care (4 to 3 days, p b 0.0001).
Overall median length of stay in acute care was unchanged from initially
10 (IQR 5–21) to finally 9 (5 to 19) days. Similar trends in care processes
were present in the sensitivity analysis which included patients from all
hospitals (Table 4).
There was no trend in the crude survival rate of 92% (chi square test
for trend p = 0.052). The risk-adjusted survival for ‘consistent
submitter’ hospitals (Fig. 2) showed an odds ratio of 1.19 (95% CI 1.03
to 1.36) for survival comparing 2008/09 and 2016/17. The trend for
the 0.19 (95% CI 0.03–0.36) increase in adjusted odds is significant (p
= 0.012). The same pattern is seen in the sensitivity analysis of patients
from all hospitals, with an odds ratio of 1.21 (95% CI 1.08 to 1.35)
(Fig. 3). The Area under the Receiver Operator curve for the model
used in risk adjustment was 0.896 (95% CI 0.893–0.898). In the adjust-
ment model 20,852 patients (8.4%) had missing data imputed for GCS
(missing GCS being imputed using the conventional TARN method
[17]) and 28,768 had missing data for comorbidities (with ‘Missing’
used as category in the model). Further sensitivity analyses on cases
with complete data (excluding those with missing data) showed similar
increases in risk adjusted odds of survival over time (not shown).
The interrupted time series analysis of quarterly “W” for the ‘consis-
tent submitters’ (Fig. 4) showed that prior to the intervention there was
no significant change with time (a slope of −0.02% excess survivors per
quarter, p = 0.526). Around the time of interruption in the time series
there was no significant change in the level of the line (+0.133% excess
survivors, p = 0.678). However, there was a significant positive change
in the slope after the intervention time point of April 2012 (+0.08% ex-
cess survivors per quarter, p = 0.023), in other words an increase of
0.08 more survivors per 100 patients every quarter.
The sensitivity analysis using all eligible patients in the TARN
database rather than just those from the hospitals who were ‘constant
submitters’ (Fig. 5) showed the same pattern of a positive change after
intervention in the slope of “W” with time (+0.07% excess survivors
15
C.G. Moran et al. / EClinicalMedicine 2–3 (2018) 13–21
 per quarter, p = 0.006). The same pattern was again seen when the
analysis was restricted to only those cases with complete data (not
shown).
5. Discussion
We have described the changes in the process of care that happened
during the implementation of Major Trauma Systems in England and
also the changing demographic of trauma in the population. Our
analysis of a cohort of rigorously identified and described major trauma
patients indicates that these changes have been associated with a
significant 19% increase in the risk adjusted odds of survival for trauma
victims who reach hospital alive. Experience in other regional systems,
such as Victoria State, Australia, suggests that improvements in
mortality may continue for up to five years as a new trauma system
matures [8].

 It is not possible to study a complete change in a national system of
care with a randomised controlled trial and so we have performed a lon-
gitudinal, series of annual cross sectional observational studies using
continuous data collection, which attempts to cover the entire national
population. The statistical methodology has been tested and refined
over many years of national trauma audit, and allows risk adjustment
for the observed changes in case-mix over time. A longitudinal study
is the best method available, however the limitation remains that
controlling for all known and unknown confounding factors in this
large, population-based study is not possible. There remains the poten-
tial for confounding from changes in data collection, as introducing the
new system appears to have resulted in a significant increase in data
collection with all eligible hospitals in England now participating in
national trauma audit.
There has been a change in recorded demographics with a signifi-
cant increase in the age of patients and more patients injured in falls
from less than 2 m. This change is likely due to the increasing age of
the population in England together with consistent under-reporting of
trauma in older patients until the new networks commenced. Data col-
lection was incomplete, with particular difficulty in obtaining compre-
hensive data from Trauma Units. Notwithstanding the increase the
number of hospitals submitting data to TARN, the numbers of TARN

 cases per annum in the 35 hospitals in the main study trebled over the
study period, and cases per hospital per annum in the ‘all patients’
dataset doubled. TARN assesses case ascertainment against Hospital Ep-
isode Statistics (HES) trauma codes in hospitalised patients meeting the
inclusion criteria. The numbers of patients coded as major trauma under
HES in the consistently submitting hospitals has increased by 117% over
the study period. There have also been changes in clinical practice dur-
ing the study period. Massive transfusion protocols [21–23], the use of
Tranexamic Acid [24, 25] and whole body (trauma) CT scan [26] have
a good evidence-base and have all become routine clinical practice dur-
ing resuscitation for major trauma during this study.
In comparison with previous studies, we have taken a national per-
spective and have included major trauma patients who are treated out-
side of major trauma centres as well as those treated at the centres of
excellence. This is important as it is certainly possible that system
changes which benefit one group of patients (those who get to a MTC)
might disadvantage another group of patients (those who are treated
outside an MTC). Many previous studies have just taken the MTC per-
spective and not included all patients [6]. Our results are similar to

 those found in the Australian state of Victoria, where a similar compre-

This study supports the healthcare policy of regionalisation of spe-
cialist services for the care of major trauma that has been implemented
within NHS-England. It is not possible to determine the specific cause of
changes in outcome as there are complex system changes taking place,
however it looks as if the overall result of the changes is an improve-
ment in outcomes. The exact cause of better outcomes cannot be deter-
mined, and it is likely that the outcomes were influenced by a complex
combination of the changes in patient flow, the changes in access to in-
vestigations and interventions, the changes in the seniority of personnel
available and the changes in the philosophy of care. In such a complex
intervention there may be little benefit in attempting to identify a sim-
ple change/outcome relationship. As well as the changes in the organi-
sation of trauma services there were also significant changes in clinical
care during the study (such as the increased use of tranexamic acid fol-
lowing from the CRASH2 trial). However, the trauma care reorganisation
may have also enabled the implementation of improvements in clinical

 care. It is recognised that innovative change in clinical practice, even
when supported by level-1 evidence, can be slow to gain acceptance
[27]. Transition from research to routine clinical practice can be ex-
tremely slow and so it is unlikely that these changes in practice would
have been implemented so quickly and so universally had the organisa-
tion of trauma care not changed. This may have been because the MTCs
all adopted similar treatment protocols, largely based upon the transla-
tion into civilian practice of the military experience in Iraq and
Afghanistan [28].
There are still a large number of unanswered questions. Whilst
regionalised care is associated with an overall benefit, there may be spe-
cific patient subgroups, such as infants or older patients, who have a dif-
ferent way of presenting to healthcare after major injury and may be
disadvantaged. A number of decisions, based on clinical consensus,
were made in the development of the English trauma systems (such
as the bypass radius for each MTC), and further evidence is required to
optimise system structures.
6. Conclusion
A change in the organisation of care for patients with severe injuries,
including the development of Major Trauma Networks that cover the
entire national population, was associated with a significant 19% (95%
CI 3%–36%) increase in the odds of survival for trauma victims who
reach the hospital alive (p = 0.012).

Authorship Statement
All of the authors were involved in each stage of the planning, inter-
pretation of results and write up of the work. The original plan was de-
veloped by CM, FL, MW, TC and KW. The statistical analysis was
performed by OB and TL, with all authors taking part in the interpreta-
tion of the results. The manuscript was drafted by CM, FL, OB and TC
with all authors commenting on the draft versions. The final version
has been approved by CM, FL, OB, TL, AE, KW and TC.
Contribution Statement
MW, FL, OB, AE and TC have been involved in the assessment of the
quality of trauma care through the Trauma Audit and Research Network
for many years and have developed the standard methodologies used in
this work (MW as TARN Chief Executive, FL as TARN Director of Re-
search, OB as the TARN Statistician and TC as Chair of the TARN
Board). The original idea for the work came from the NHS England Clin-
ical Advisory Group in discussions held between 2008 and 2010. The
plan for the study was developed by CM, FL, MW, TC and KW. The statis-
tical analysis plan was developed between CM, FL, OB, TL and KW and
was carried out by OB. All of the authors were involved in discussion
about the interpretation of the results and the best method of
presentation.
