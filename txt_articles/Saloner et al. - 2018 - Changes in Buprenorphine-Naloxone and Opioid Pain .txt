Abstract
IMPORTANCE Expanding Medicaid eligibility could affect prescriptions of buprenorphine with
naloxone, an established treatment for opioid use disorder, and opioid pain relievers (OPRs).
OBJECTIVE To examine changes in prescriptions of buprenorphine with naloxone and OPRs after
the US Affordable Care Act Medicaid expansion.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this cohort study, longitudinal, patient-level, retail
pharmacy claims were extracted from IQVIA real-world data from an anonymized, longitudinal,
prescription database. The sample included 11.9 million individuals who filled 2 or more prescriptions
for a prescription opioid during at least 1 year between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2015, from
California, Maryland, and Washington (expansion states) and Florida and Georgia (nonexpansion
states). Data analysis was conducted from August 1, 2017, to May 31, 2018. Data were aggregated to
county-year observations (N = 2082) and linked to county-level covariates. For each outcome, a
difference-in-differences regression model was estimated comparing changes before and after
expansion in expansion vs nonexpansion counties. Models were adjusted for county demographics,
uninsured rate, and overdose mortality in the baseline year (2010).
EXPOSURES Presence of Medicaid expansion in the year.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES For buprenorphine with naloxone and OPRs, rates per
100 000 county residents were calculated separately for any prescriptions overall and by different
payment sources. Mean days of medication per county among people filling prescriptions for these
agents were also determined.
RESULTS The study sample included 11.9 million individuals (expansion states: 40.9% men; mean
[SD] age, 44.1 [13.8] years; nonexpansion states: 41.0% men; mean [SD] age, 43.7 [13.7] years). In
expansion counties, 68.8 individuals per 100 000 county residents filled buprenorphine with
naloxone and 5298.3 filled OPR prescriptions in 2010. After expansion, buprenorphine with
naloxone fills per 100 000 county residents increased significantly in expansion relative to
nonexpansion counties (8.7; 95% CI, 1.7 to 15.7). Opioid pain reliever fills per 100 000 county
residents did not significantly change in expansion counties relative to nonexpansion counties (327.4;
95% CI âˆ’202.5 to 857.4). The rate of OPRs per 100 000 county residents paid for by Medicaid
significantly increased (374.0; 95% CI, 258.3 to 489.7). There were no significant changes in days per
100 000 county residents of either medication after expansion.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Medicaid expansion significantly increased buprenorphine with
naloxone prescriptions per 100 000 county residents in expansion counties, suggesting that
expansion improved access to opioid use disorder treatment. Expansion did not significantly increase

Key Points
Question Did Medicaid expansion
under the US Affordable Care Act
change prescription fills for
buprenorphine with naloxone, a
treatment for opioid use disorder, and
opioid pain relievers?
Findings In this cohort study using
difference-in-differences analysis of
all-payer prescription fill data from 5
states, Medicaid expansion was
associated with a significant overall
increase in people filling prescriptions
for buprenorphine with naloxone.
Expansion was not associated with
changes in fills per 100 000 county
residents of opioid pain relievers overall,
but significantly more people filled
prescriptions for opioid pain relievers
paid for specifically by Medicaid.
Meaning Medicaid expansion may
increase the role of states in providing
opioid use disorder treatment and in
paying for opioid pain relievers for pain
management.

with OPRs paid for by Medicaid. This finding therefore suggests the growing importance of Medicaid
in pain management and addiction prevention.

Introduction
Between 2010 and 2016, the uninsured rate in the United States declined from 16% to 9%, largely
because of provisions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA).1 The main coverage provisions of the ACA
were implemented in 2014, including Medicaid expansion to individuals below 138% of the federal
poverty level and health insurance exchanges with sliding-scale subsidies for individuals above 100%
of the poverty level. Although the exchanges are national, Medicaid expansion is an optional program
that was initially adopted by the District of Columbia and 25 states, with several additional states
expanding such coverage by 2018. Coverage gains have been larger in Medicaid-expansion states
than in nonexpansion states.1
The increases in insurance coverage under the ACA have occurred alongside increasing injuries
and deaths attributable to opioids. Opioids, including both prescription opioid pain relievers (OPRs)
and heroin and illicit fentanyl, now account for almost two-thirds of all drug overdose deaths.2
Overdoses have quadrupled since the late 1990s and are now the leading cause of injury death in the
United States.2
Concerns have been raised by ACA opponents that the Medicaid expansion has made the opioid
crisis worse, contending that new enrollees could use their insurance to gain access to low-cost
OPRs, increasing rates of abuse and diversion.3 Fatal drug overdoses increased more rapidly in
Medicaid-expansion states than nonexpansion states from 2013 to 2015, but this trend was higher in
years prior to Medicaid expansion and thus unlikely to be caused by the ACA.4 A recent analysis
found that opioid-related hospitalizations did not increase more rapidly in expansion vs
nonexpansion states.5 Even if fatal overdoses and hospitalizations were not affected by the ACA, it is
still possible that Medicaid expansion could have increased OPR prescribing. One recent study
compared trends in the volume of OPRs paid for by Medicaid in expansion and nonexpansion states
and found that Medicaid-reimbursed OPRs increased in both states, but did not significantly differ by
Medicaid-expansion status. This study, however, did not examine corresponding changes in other
sources of payment, leaving open the question of whether there were offsetting changes in out-of-
pocket payment or private insurance.6
Conversely, the ACA insurance expansion could play a role in combating the opioid epidemic by
increasing access to treatment of opioid use disorder, which is a required benefit in the ACA
insurance exchanges and Medicaid-expansion plans.7 Opioid use disorder can be managed
beneficially with medication, yet most individuals with opioid use disorder do not receive any
treatment.8 Buprenorphine, a partial opioid agonist medication that can be prescribed by clinicians
who possess a federal waiver, is likely to be one treatment that is especially sensitive to health
insurance coverage changes. Although some buprenorphine formulations are indicated for pain relief
(eg, the transdermal patch), combined buprenorphine and naloxone is the most common
formulation and is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of opioid
dependence (and rarely used for pain management).9 Consultation with an office-based prescriber
is difficult for uninsured patients to access compared with patients with Medicaid or private
insurance, and buprenorphine with naloxone is an expensive medication for patients paying out of
pocket.10 The total volume of buprenorphine with naloxone reimbursed by Medicaid increased more
in expansion states compared with nonexpansion states,6,11,12 but as with OPRs, research has not
examined how much of this increase is accounted for by new patients initiating treatment vs patients
shifting from other payers to Medicaid after expansion.

 We quantified changes in OPR and buprenorphine with naloxone prescription fills after the ACA
using longitudinal, patient-level, retail pharmacy claims data from an all-payer database in 5 states.
We hypothesized that the number of patients filling prescriptions for both OPRs and buprenorphine
with naloxone would increase after Medicaid expansion in expansion states relative to nonexpansion
states. We also hypothesized that the share of both OPRs and buprenorphine with naloxone
reimbursed by Medicaid would increase after expansion and that cash payment would decrease
because of increased insurance coverage.
Methods
Setting and Selection of Study Participants
We used the IQVIA real-world anonymized, longitudinal, prescription data on individuals prescribed
medications in California, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, and Washington between January 1, 2010, and
December 31, 2015. During the time of our study, the database captured approximately 75% to 80%
of retail transactions in the United States that are automatically reported to IQVIA through weekly
feeds from retail, food store, independent, and mass merchandiser pharmacies. These anonymized,
all-payer claims data contain detailed information for each prescription, including the fill date, daysâ€™
supply, and payment type. These data have been used previously to study buprenorphine and OPR
fills associated with policy.13,14 Analysis was conducted from August 1, 2017, to May 31, 2018. Analysis
of secondary, deidentified data is considered exempt by the Johns Hopkins Institutional Review
Board. This study followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in
Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guideline.
The extracted data obtained for the study included the full set of prescription records for
individuals filling 2 or more prescriptions for any opioid (either OPRs or buprenorphine with
naloxone) during the study period with at least 1 claim from the 5 study states. The requirement of 2
opioid claims was made to identify people who might be more at risk of chronic opioid use. Using
National Drug Codes, we separately identified schedule II to IV nonbuprenorphine OPRs and
buprenorphine with naloxone.15 Methadone in retail pharmacy claims is included as an OPR because
it can be prescribed only for pain management (ie, not opioid use disorder). We restricted our sample
to adults aged 18 to 65 years. We assigned people to the county where they retrieved the majority
of their prescriptions. Our final sample included 162.9 million transactions for 11.9 million individuals.
The individual records were then aggregated to county-year summary observations, which was our
main unit of analysis. Across the 5 states there were 347 counties that were tracked through the 6
study years (2082 county-years). Of these, there was at least 1 individual with prescriptions in 2000
county-years, and we imputed a 0 value for 82 county-years during which there were no records of
filled prescriptions.
California, Maryland, and Washington expanded Medicaid under the ACA statewide January, 1
2014, and Florida and Georgia did not expand during the study period. In addition, California
obtained a federal waiver that allowed counties to adopt Medicaid expansion beginning in 2011. We
thus defined Medicaid expansion as present in counties that had an expansion for the full calendar
year using expansion dates reported in a prior study.16 There were 121 counties in the Medicaid-
expansion states and 333 county-years in which Medicaid expansion was present.
Prescription-Related Outcomes
Using the prescription data, we calculated the number of people in our sample during each county-
year who filled a prescription for an OPR or buprenorphine with naloxone. These counts provided a
basis for examining trends over time, but by design, our data excluded some individuals, such as
those with only 1 prescription for an opioid, people receiving medication from nonretail sources, and
people younger than 18 years or older than 65 years. Therefore, our data should not be interpreted
as measuring the county-wide prevalence of either medication during a given year.

 We calculated fill rates of OPR or buprenorphine with naloxone per 100 000 population across
all payers using annual counts for each medication and annual county-level population estimates
from the American Community Survey.17 We also quantified prescription rates per 100 000 county
residents for OPR and buprenorphine with naloxone in counties separately paid for by the 4 main
sources of payment: Medicaid (including both fee-for-service and managed care), cash, private
insurance, and Medicare. Because the same individual could fill prescriptions with more than 1 payer,
the sum of all rates per 100 000 county residents by payer equals more than the overall mean county
fill rate per 100 000 county residents. To examine changes in duration of medication filled, we also
measured the mean number of days of filled medication in each county-year among people who had
at least 1 prescription filled.
County Covariates
We included county-level measures from the Area Health Resource File captured during 2010, our
baseline study year, including the physician-to-population ratio, the uninsured rate, median income,
percentage of women, and percentage from major racial/ethnic groups, including non-Hispanic
white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, and other non-Hispanic.18 We also included the drug overdose
death rate in the county during 2010 using county-level categories created by the National Center for
Health Statistics.19
Statistical Analysis
We first summarized trends associated with prescription rates overall and by source of payment, and
annual duration of treatment for OPRs and buprenorphine with naloxone during the study period.
We stratified the sample by Medicaid-expansion vs nonexpansion counties and created annual plots
showing the rate of individuals filling prescriptions for OPRs and buprenorphine with naloxone, and
the same rates by source of payment. In all analyses, we weighted each observation by the countyâ€™
s
population using data from the American Community Survey.
Next, we estimated a difference-in-differences regression model that identified the outcomes
of Medicaid expansion by comparing the pre- and post-Medicaid-expansion change in expansion
counties with the changes in nonexpansion counties during the same period. By focusing on
temporal changes between the 2 groups, difference-in-differences models minimize bias that might
otherwise arise from cross-sectional comparisons because of selection into Medicaid expansion. The
models assume that nonexpansion states provide a counterfactual trend for counties in expansion
states. This assumption is more plausible if the trend in outcomes between counties in expansion and
nonexpansion states did not differ significantly in years prior to the expansion, and thus we tested
for parallel trends in pre-expansion years (eTable 1 in the Supplement).
Models included state and year fixed effects. All models were estimated using ordinary least-
squares regression, which is suited for interpreting interactions.20 Standard errors were clustered at
the state level using the clustered sandwich estimator.21 In unadjusted analysis, we calculated
standardized effect sizes for unadjusted comparisons focusing on moderate or greater effect sizes
(>0.5).22 We calculated 95% CIs for all regression estimates and adopted 2-tailed, unpaired P < .05 as
the threshold for statistical significance. Data were analyzed using Stata, version 15.1 (StataCorp).
Sensitivity Analyses
We considered several sensitivity analyses. First, we tested whether our results were different using
an alternative sample that includes individuals who are consistently observed in the prescription fill
data. This alternative (constant) sample consists of 4.7 million individuals who have records in all of
the study years for any medications (not exclusively opioids). Second, as an alternative to the
difference-in-differences approach, we examined a regression model that includes an additional
interaction term with the countyâ€™
s uninsured rate in 2010, an approach that has been used to test for
within-state variation based on expected uptake of insurance.23 Third, we tested the sensitivity of
our analyses to excluding data from each of the states by dropping each state 1 at a time and

 rerunning the models. Fourth, we reran our models applying inverse probability of treatment
weights. These weights allowed us to adjust our sample of nonexpansion counties to more closely
resemble our expansion counties. We generated our weights using the county-level covariates from
the baseline year. In our regression analysis, we created a new combined weight by multiplying
inverse probability of treatment weight by our population weight.24
Results
Table 1 examines the mean age and sex of individuals in the IQVIA study sample and other county-
level characteristics for their counties of residence from the American Community Survey in 2010.
Sampled individuals in expansion counties included 40.9% men; mean (SD) age was 44.1 (13.8) years.
Individuals in nonexpansion counties had similar demographics (41.0% men; mean [SD] age, 43.7
[13.7] years). Counties in the Medicaid-expansion states included more people of Hispanic and other
race/ethnicity and fewer African American and non-Hispanic white individuals than nonexpansion
states. The counties in expansion states had higher median incomes, lower uninsured rates, and
more primary care physicians.
Opioid Pain Relievers
For the 2010-2015 period, fills per 100 000 residents for OPRs declined from 5298.3 to 4316.2 in
expansion counties and from 7404.2 to 5510.6 in nonexpansion counties (Figure 1). The mean days
with filled OPRs increased for both groups of counties from 88.1 to 94.5 in expansion counties and
from 88.4 to 96.5 in nonexpansion counties (Figure 1). The rate of individuals filling OPRs reimbursed
by Medicaid per 100 000 increased in expansion counties from 859.5 to 1170.9, while declining in
nonexpansion counties from 943.4 to 750.6 (Figure 2). The rate of individuals filling OPRs paid for by
all other forms of payment (private insurance, cash, and Medicare) declined in both expansion and
nonexpansion counties during the study period (Figure 2).
In difference-in-differences analysis, there was no statistically significant change in the OPR fill
rate per 100 000 county residents after Medicaid expansion in expansion counties vs nonexpansion

 counties (327.4; 95% CI, âˆ’202.5 to 857.4; P = .16) (Table 2). There was a significant increase in the
rate of individuals filling OPRs paid for by Medicaid after the expansion in the expansion counties
compared with nonexpansion counties of 374.0 per 100 000 population (95% CI, 258.3 to 489.7;
P < .001). Contrary to hypothesis that there would be an offsetting decrease in cash payment, there
were no significant changes in the rate of fills paid for by private insurance, cash, or Medicare.
Similarly, there was no significant change in the number of days of the medication filled in Medicaid-
expansion counties after expansion compared with non-Medicaid-expansion-counties.
Buprenorphine With Naloxone
For the 2010-2015 period, the rate per 100 000 residents of individuals filling buprenorphine with
naloxone prescriptions increased in expansion counties from 68.8 to 77.1. In nonexpansion counties,
the rate was 98.8 in 2010 and 99.2 in 2015 (Figure 1). The annual days of fills increased in expansion
counties from 154.4 to 173.3 days and 135.2 to 172.1 days in nonexpansion counties (Figure 1). The rate
of individuals with fills paid for by Medicaid per 100 000 increased from 10.6 to 25.4 in expansion
counties and from 5.2 to 8.5 in nonexpansion counties (Figure 3). For other forms of payment, the
rate of individuals paying for buprenorphine with naloxone with cash declined in both expansion and

 nonexpansion counties, but there were slight increases for private insurance and Medicare in both
groups of counties.
In difference-in-differences analysis, there was a significant increase of 8.7 per 100 000 (95%
CI, 1.7-15.7; P = .03) in the overall rate of individuals filling buprenorphine with naloxone prescriptions
in expansion counties vs nonexpansion counties after Medicaid expansion (Table 2). Although this
increase corresponds to a commensurate change in the rate of buprenorphine with naloxone fills per
100 000 county residents paid for by Medicaid (9.3; 95% CI, âˆ’1.6 to 20.1), this change was not
statistically significant at conventional levels (P = .08). All changes by other payers were smaller and
not statistically significant. There were no significant changes in the mean number of days of
medication.
Sensitivity Analyses
We did not find evidence that the parallel trends assumption was violated for any of our regression
outcomes (eTable 1 in the Supplement). Analyses limited to individuals consistently observed in the
data yielded results that were smaller, but in a consistent direction to, our main analyses (eTable 2
in the Supplement). Models that additionally tested for differences between counties with higher vs
lower baseline uninsured rates did not find that a countyâ€™
s baseline uninsured rate differentially
influenced changes after Medicaid expansion (eTable 3 in the Supplement). Results held up in models

 that dropped each state 1 at a time, with consistent changes in magnitude and direction associated
with fill rates overall and fills with Medicaid (eTable 4 in the Supplement). Finally, models that applied
the inverse probability of treatment weights yielded results that were qualitatively similar to the main
results but were less precisely estimated (eTable 5 and eTable 6 in the Supplement).
Discussion
The ACA has expanded insurance to millions of Americans, yet little is known about whether the law
changed use of OPRs or buprenorphine with naloxone. We used longitudinal, anonymized, all-payer
claims from several states to examine this question. Consistent with other analyses,25 we found that
the rate of OPRs from all sources of payment steadily declined overall during the study period, while
rates of buprenorphine with naloxone fills steadily increased. There was no statistically significant
change in the fill rate for OPRs in expansion counties. These results are important given how little is
known about the result of Medicaid expansion on opioid utilization, as well as concerns that Medicaid
expansion fueled the opioid epidemic.26
We found that the overall rate of buprenorphine with naloxone significantly increased in
expansion counties relative to nonexpansion counties. Compared with the baseline rate of
buprenorphine with naloxone, our analysis implies a roughly 13% increase in buprenorphine with
naloxone use in the population. Prior studies have shown that the volume of buprenorphine claims
paid by Medicaid specifically substantially increased after Medicaid expansion,6,11 but we believe that
our study is the first to look across all payers. Our findings indicate that overall fills of buprenorphine
with naloxone increased, and not merely those reimbursed by Medicaid, potentially indicating an
increase overall in office-based treatment for opioid use disorder. Study findings are important to
consider in light of the mixed evidence on whether expanding Medicaid increases opioid use disorder
treatment.11,27-29
Our findings underscore the important role that Medicaid programs play in the opioid epidemic,
especially in expansion states. State Medicaid programs have a variety of opportunities to encourage
safer use of prescription opioids, including through the design of formularies and utilization
management tools, such as prior authorization and quantity limits, that promote the use of evidence-
based treatments for chronic noncancer pain.30 For example, Maryland and Washington Medicaid
now have prior authorization requirements in place for patients seeking high-dosage or long-acting

 opioids.31 The effect of these efforts, as well as many other initiatives by a variety of stakeholders,
might account for the reductions in OPR prescription volume that were observed during the study
period, although further evaluation is needed to assess the degree to which these changes have
reduced high-risk opioid prescriptions and nonmedical use as well as improved the management
of pain.
Many Medicaid programs are also taking steps to increase access to buprenorphine for the
treatment of opioid use disorder, which is a critical step to combat the current opioid crisis. Some
states are focused on increasing the prescriber base by encouraging more physicians to obtain
prescribing waivers and granting scope of practice to nurse practitioners and physician assistants,
which is a change supported by recent federal regulations.32 The 21st Century Cures Act provides $1
billion to states over 2 years to undertake system reforms that could also increase buprenorphine
access for patients, such as care integration models that link office-based prescribers to specialty
treatment clinics. States are also revisiting their prior authorization rules to ensure that they do not
hinder access to buprenorphine, although many states continue to maintain limitations on
buprenorphine prescribing in Medicaid. Beyond increasing the number of patients in treatment,
Medicaid programs are beginning to monitor quality of care, focusing on continuity of buprenorphine
treatment and provision of appropriate psychosocial services and oversight of patients receiving
buprenorphine.33

 Limitations
Our study has several limitations. Because we only included 5 states in our analysis, the findings may
not represent the experience of other states. However, 26% of the US population resides in the 5
states that we included. Moreover, the 2 expansion states were not necessarily comparable to the
nonexpansion states because of demographic and social differences that may have led them to
follow different trends independent of ACA Medicaid expansion. Although we attempted to control
for these variations through county demographic covariates and state-level fixed effects, there could
be unobserved differences between the states that are associated with the outcomes that we
measured. Some variables include a patientâ€™
s rate of physician office visits, locations of physicians
who have buprenorphine waivers, and a patientâ€™
s utilization of other drug therapies for opioid use
disorder, such as methadone, which is not captured in retail prescription data. Although we used the
same study period as other recent studies of ACA Medicaid expansion,34,35 including more years prior
to 2010 could improve our ability to establish the pre-expansion trends. Likewise, including years
after 2015 could improve estimation of postexpansion change. Finally, we cannot rule out alternative
explanations that may be driving prescription rates independent of the ACA. These could include
state-specific changes adopted by payers to alter prior authorization for opioids, increased scrutiny
of opioid prescribing, changed pain management practices, or expansions of buprenorphine
prescriber capacity.
Conclusions
Insurance expansions under the ACA occurred during a period of declining OPR fills and increasing
buprenorphine with naloxone fills. In the 5 states that we studied, we found that Medicaid expansion
was associated with more individuals overall filling buprenorphine with naloxone prescriptions.
Although there was no significant overall change in OPR fills per 100 000 county residents, Medicaid
expansion was associated with more individuals filling OPRs paid for by Medicaid specifically. The
increasing role of Medicaid in covering populations seeking these treatments suggests the need for
comprehensive efforts by state programs to track patients receiving OPRs, expand nonopioid
options for pain care, screen for opioid use disorder, and link high-risk patients to evidence-based
addiction treatments, such as treatment with buprenorphine with naloxone. The potential
implications of these changes in prescription use on rates of addiction and overdose are an important
area for future research.
