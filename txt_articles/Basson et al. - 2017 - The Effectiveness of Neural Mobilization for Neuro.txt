U
USTUDY DESIGN: Systematic review with meta-
analysis.
U
UOBJECTIVES: To determine the efficacy of 
neural mobilization (NM) for musculoskeletal 
conditions with a neuropathic component.
U
UBACKGROUND: Neural mobilization, or 
neurodynamics, is a movement-based intervention 
aimed at restoring the homeostasis in and around 
the nervous system. The current level of evidence 
for NM is largely unknown.
U
UMETHODS: A database search for randomized 
trials investigating the effect of NM on neuromus-
culoskeletal conditions was conducted, using 
standard methods for article identification, selec-
tion, and quality appraisal. Where possible, studies 
were pooled for meta-analysis, with pain, disability, 
and function as the primary outcomes.
U
URESULTS: Forty studies were included in this 
review, of which 17 had a low risk of bias. Meta-
analyses could only be performed on self-reported 
outcomes. For chronic low back pain, disability 
(Oswestry Disability Questionnaire [0-50]: mean 
difference, –9.26; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 
–14.50, –4.01; P<.001) and pain (intensity [0-10]: 
mean difference, –1.78; 95% CI: –2.55, –1.01; 
P<.001) improved following NM. For chronic 
neck-arm pain, pain improved (intensity: mean 
difference, –1.89; 95% CI: –3.14, –0.64; P<.001) 
following NM. For most of the clinical outcomes in 
individuals with carpal tunnel syndrome, NM was 
not effective (P>.11) but showed some positive 
neurophysiological effects (eg, reduced intraneural 
edema). Due to a scarcity of studies or conflict-
ing results, the effect of NM remains uncertain 
for various conditions, such as postoperative low 
back pain, cubital tunnel syndrome, and lateral 
epicondylalgia.
U
UCONCLUSION: This review reveals benefits of 
NM for back and neck pain, but the effect of NM 
on other conditions remains unclear. Due to the 
limited evidence and varying methodological qual-
ity, conclusions may change over time.

T
he 2010 Global Burden of Disease study revealed 
that musculoskeletal disorders are the second 
biggest contributor to disability worldwide.118 Low 
back–related leg pain and neck-related arm pain 
can arise from a lesion or disease affecting the peripheral 
nervous system.69,99 The peripheral nervous system is also compromised 
in common entrapment neuropathies, such as carpal tunnel syndrome
 (CTS) and cubital tunnel 
syndrome, and may be af-
fected in conditions such 
as lateral epicondylalgia27 
and plantar heel pain.6 
The effectiveness of neu-
ral mobilization (NM) for neuromusculo-
skeletal conditions remains unclear.
Neurodynamics (NM) is an interven-
tion aimed at restoring the homeostasis 
in and around the nervous system, by mo-
bilization of the nervous system itself or 
the structures that surround the nervous 
system.32,34 Neural mobilization facilitates 
movement between neural structures and 
their surroundings (interface) through 
manual techniques or exercise.83 Human 
and animal studies revealed that NM 
reduces intraneural edema,101 improves 
intraneural fluid dispersion,20,53 reduces 
thermal and mechanical hyperalgesia,105 
and reverses the increased immune re-
sponses96,105 following a nerve injury. 
Three systematic reviews evaluated the 
effectiveness of NM. One review77 focused 
on CTS (6 studies) and observed a pos-
sible trend toward improved outcomes 
following NM, but concluded that the effi-
cacy of NM for CTS was unclear. Another 
review45 included various musculoskeletal 
conditions (11 studies) and concluded 
that, although the evidence supported the

use of NM, the evidence was limited. A 
recent review108 (20 studies) assessed the 
effect of NM on chronic conditions and 
concluded that NM is not superior to oth-
er interventions. This review focused on 
chronic musculoskeletal conditions and 
only considered the outcome measures of 
pain and disability. A narrative review of 
NM for spinal radiculopathy concluded 
that NM might be beneficial for certain 
subgroups of patients.44
Since the publication of these reviews, 
additional randomized trials have been 
published on the effectiveness of NM. The 
objective of this systematic review was to 
assess the effectiveness of NM for neuro-
musculoskeletal conditions, as measured 
by outcomes related to pain, disability, 
and function. It was anticipated that an 
updated systematic review with meta-
analysis would provide more definite an-
swers regarding the effectiveness of NM 
for neuromusculoskeletal conditions.
METHODS
Protocol and Registration
T
he protocol for this systematic 
review was published in the Joanna 
Briggs Institute Database of Sys-
tematic Reviews and Implementation 
Reports (registration number 1401).12
Eligibility Criteria
Studies Randomized clinical trials, pub-
lished in English, that evaluated the effect 
of NM in participants over the age of 18 
years with neuromusculoskeletal condi-
tions indicative of neural tissue dysfunc-
tion were considered for inclusion. Case 
reports and case-control and cohort stud-
ies were excluded. Studies that evaluated 
the effect of NM in systemic diseases, 
central nervous system disorders, and 
polyneuropathies were excluded. Animal 
studies or studies on healthy participants 
were also excluded.
Interventions Studies that evaluated the 
effect of NM on disorders where neu-
rodynamic dysfunction was implicated 
were considered for inclusion. Neural 
mobilization could be achieved through 
active exercises or passive techniques. 
Included techniques could be directed 
to the nervous system itself (eg, sliding 
and tensioning techniques30,32,33,46) or to 
the structures that surround the nervous 
system (eg, cervical lateral glide36,48 or 
lumbar foraminal opening100 techniques).
Outcome Measures Outcome measures 
of primary interest were pain, disability, 
and/or function. Disability is defined as 
encompassing impairments, activity limi-
tation, participation restriction, personal 
factors, and environmental factors.62,107 
Secondary outcomes included quality-
of-life measures, limb or joint range of 
motion (ROM), neurodynamic test out-
comes (eg, levels and region of symptom 
provocation, presence of neural struc-
tural differentiation and test sequence 
ROM), and neurophysiological changes 
(eg, changes in temporal summation, 
median nerve intraneural edema, and 
H-reflex latency).
Search Strategy
The databases searched included MED-
LINE (PubMed), CINAHL Plus, Coch-
rane Central Register of Controlled 
Trials, Physiotherapy Evidence Database, 
ProQuest Central (Family Health, Health 
and Medical Complete), Nursing and Al-
lied Health Source, EBSCO MasterFILE 
Premier, ScienceDirect, and Scopus. The 
search was conducted to include articles 
from January 1980 to April 2016. The 
search for unpublished studies included 
EBSCO MasterFILE Premier. A previous 
review45 searched from 1830, and the 
oldest article included in that review was 
from 1996.
The search terms included neural, 
nerve, mobilization, manipulation, 
physical therapy, physiotherapy, manual 
therapy, exercises, treatment, interven-
tion, management, modality, stretching, 
tension, and neurodynamics (APPENDIX A, 
available at www.jospt.org).
Methodological Quality
Two independent reviewers (A.B. and 
B.O.) considered records for inclusion, 
and full text was reviewed after identify-
ing relevant titles and abstracts. Articles 
that met the inclusion criteria were as-
sessed by 2 independent reviewers using 
the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Meta-
Analysis of Statistics Assessment and 
Review Instrument for critical appraisal 
(MAStARI)63 (APPENDIX B, available at 
www.jospt.org). The MAStARI is a tool 
that was developed by experts and ratified 
by the JBI’s International Scientific Com-
mittee. It has been designed for review 
and critical appraisal of methodology of 
individual studies and for meta-analysis 
following appraisal. In this regard, the 
MAStARI tool was used to establish the 
methodological quality of included stud-
ies and to conduct the relevant meta-
analyses.63 Disagreements were discussed 
between the 2 reviewers. Any unresolved 
issues were resolved through discussion 
with a third reviewer (R.E.). Agreement 
between reviewers was evaluated using 
Cohen’s kappa. Risk of bias was assessed 
independently of study appraisal using 
the GRADE guidelines.56 This takes into 
account randomization, concealment of 
allocation, blinding of outcomes assess-
ment, incomplete outcome data, selective 
reporting, and other biases, such as stop-
ping early for benefit or the use of non-
validated outcome measures.
Data Collection
Data extracted from studies were grouped 
together by patient subgroup, patient 
demographics, interventions, outcome 
measures, timing of assessments, and 
main results. Authors were contacted for 
clarification or missing data.
Data Synthesis
Quantitative data, where possible, were 
pooled in a statistical meta-analysis us-
ing the MAStARI. Effect sizes, expressed 
as odds ratios for categorical data and 
weighted mean differences for continuous 
data, and their 95% confidence intervals 
(CIs) were calculated for analysis. Hetero-
geneity was assessed statistically using a 
standard chi-square test. Meta-analyses 
were not performed when the chi-square 
test had a P value of less than .1.63 Where

statistical pooling was not possible, the 
findings are presented in a narrative form.
Levels of Evidence
The JBI Levels of Evidence and Grades of 
Recommendation64 (APPENDIX C, available at 
www.jospt.org) were used for making rec-
ommendations about treatment efficacy.
Meta-analysis
Meta-analyses were conducted for CTS 
(outcomes: pain intensity, Phalen’s test, 
grip strength, 2-point discrimination, 
and the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder 
and Hand questionnaire), nerve-related 
low back pain (N-LBP) (outcomes: modi-
fied Oswestry Disability Questionnaire 
and pain intensity), and nerve-related 
neck and arm pain (N-NAP) (outcome: 
pain intensity). It was not possible to 
perform a meta-analysis for lateral epi-
condylalgia, cubital tunnel syndrome, 
post–lumbar surgery, tarsal tunnel syn-
drome, or plantar heel pain.
RESULTS
F
orty studies, with a total of 1759 
participants, were included in the 
review, 19 of which were included 
in a meta-analysis for CTS, N-LBP, and 
N-NAP (FIGURE 1). Primary and second-
ary outcome measures for 1 study were 
reported separately in 2 papers, and these 
2 papers were therefore treated as 1.35,36 
There were 12 studies for CTS, 11 for N-
LBP, 10 for N-NAP, 3 for lateral epicon-
dylalgia, and 1 each for cubital and tarsal 
tunnel syndrome, plantar heel pain, and 
postoperative low back pain. The exclud-
ed studies are listed in APPENDIX D (avail-
able at www.jospt.org).
Risk of Bias Across Studies
The initial overall level of agreement be-
tween the 2 reviewers was κ = 0.615 (95% 
CI: 0.41, 0.82), indicating good reliability. 
The main areas of disagreement between 
reviewers were blinding of participants, 
whether groups were treated equally, and 
whether appropriate statistical analyses 
were performed. Seventeen studies had a 
low risk of bias and 23 studies had an un-
clear or high risk of bias. The assessment 
of risk of bias is presented in the study 
descriptions and in APPENDIX E (available 
at www.jospt.org). The most problematic 
domains were blinding of assessors and 
concealed allocation. Incomplete out-
come data and high dropout rates were 
commonly listed as other forms of bias. 
Blinding of participants is often difficult 
in clinical trials, although some of the 
studies used a sham intervention that 
successfully blinded participants.15,66
Techniques Used as NM
The NM techniques that were assessed 
most frequently were NM exercises for 
CTS; cervical lateral glides for N-NAP and 
lateral epicondylalgia; mobilization in the 
slump position for N-LBP; and straight 
leg raise (SLR) mobilization for N-LBP, 
tarsal tunnel syndrome, plantar heel pain, 
and postoperative low back pain.
Nerve-Related Low Back Pain
The majority of studies had a high risk of 
bias (TABLE 1). Five studies evaluated mo-
bilization in the slump position,4,25,61,81,90 
which resulted in significant improve-
ments in pain and disability. Three 
studies compared mobilization in slump 
with exercises and lumbar mobiliza-
tion,25,61,81 and 1 compared it to stabili-
zation exercises.4 One study could not 
be included in the meta-analysis, as it 
measured the H-reflex and compared 
slump with SLR.90 The treatment period 
varied between 1 and 6 weeks (TABLE 2). 
The remaining studies used a variety of 
techniques; SLR was compared to exer-

cises in 2 studies.2,65 Neural mobiliza-
tion techniques that aimed to open the 
intervertebral foramina78 also reported 
improved pain (P = .01) in the NM group 
compared to a group receiving ultra-
sound, exercises, and lumbar mobiliza-
tion. Three studies compared 2 types of 
NM with each other.75,87,90 All NM groups 
had an improvement in pain (P<.05), 
but there were no significant between-
group differences (P>.05).
The meta-analyses revealed that NM 
(slump and SLR mobilization) had a sig-
nificant effect on both pain25,43,61,65,81 (in-
tensity [0-10]: mean difference, –1.78; 
95% CI: –2.55, –1.01; P<.001) (FIGURE 2)

(FIGURE 3) in participants with N-LBP 
when compared to exercises or to exer-
cise and lumbar mobilization. Included 
studies had low, as well as high, risk 
 
of bias.
The H-reflex latency was improved 
in a study comparing slump and SLR 
mobilization,90 and a decrease in nerve 
compression was reported in another 
study.75 Four studies measured ROM in 
N-LBP.43,65,78,87 They reported improve-
ment in SLR65,87 and slump78 following 
NM, but no change in Lasègue’s sign.43
Nerve-Related Neck and Arm Pain
Five of the 10 studies had a low risk of bias 
(TABLE 1).5,36,68,84,89 Two studies used only 
1 intervention.36,76 The study period and 
number of treatments varied greatly be-
tween studies (TABLE 3). Four studies evalu-
ated cervical lateral glide techniques,5,36,84,89 
and all reported a significant improvement 
in pain for the groups receiving NM. Cer-
vical lateral glide was compared to a wait-
list group,5 ultrasound,35,36 and advice 
only,84 and these studies were included in 
the meta-analysis (pain intensity: mean 
difference, –1.89; 95% CI: –3.14, –0.64; 
P<.001) (FIGURE 4). The fourth study was 
not included in the meta-analysis, as it 
compared cervical lateral glide techniques, 
sliders, thoracic mobilization, and exercise 
to strengthening exercises.89
Four studies used sliding and ten-
sioning exercises.55,67,76,82 The use of NM 
exercises resulted in significant improve-
ments in pain (P<.001) compared to 
interferential therapy, traction, and exer-
cises.82 Sliding techniques improved pain 
compared to exercise and ergonomic ad-
vice55 (P<.05). When comparing NM for 
the radial nerve to McKenzie exercises,67 
McKenzie exercises had better outcomes 
for pain (P<.001). The above studies all 
had a high risk of bias.
The effect of NM on disability could 
not be explored by meta-analysis, as 
different outcomes were used. One low-
risk-of-bias study84 reported better out-
comes (number needed to treat) for the 
Neck Disability Index (NDI) and the 
Patient-Specific Functional Scale follow-
ing NM compared to advice to stay ac-
tive. Two other studies reported better 
outcomes (P<.05) on the NDI following

NM compared to joint mobilization and 
exercise.7,55 One study did not report the 
outcomes for the NDI.82 Another study 
also measured the NDI68 but found that 
the NM group and comparison group 
improved to the same extent. One low-
risk-of-bias study documented that NM 
resulted in no adverse effects.84
Pain was the only outcome measure 
for which a meta-analysis could be per-
formed. Participants who received cervi-
cal lateral glides had a significantly better 
outcome for pain than the control groups 
(FIGURE 4).
There were 3 studies on N-NAP that 
assessed ROM.35,55,89 Two studies report-
ed an improvement in neurodynamic test 
ROM following NM,35,55 whereas 1 study 
found no difference.89

Routine physical therapy, including

symptom-severity scale (IG, 1.53 ± 
0.53; CG, 1.7 ± 0.72), VAS (IG, 2.68 ±

tension test (IG, 9.04 ± 9.6; CG, 18.41 ± 
11.6), and Phalen’s sign (IG, 19%; CG, 
31%) in patients with CTS (P<.05)
The NM in combination with routine physi-
cal therapy improved the functional 
status scale and the median nerve 
distal motor latency. This combination 
can be used as an effective noninvasive 
treatment for patients with CTS

The other studies15,86,101,111,119 used a vari-
ety of different techniques. Treatment in 
comparison groups included in the meta-
analyses consisted of splint only3,19,88,101; 
splint and ultrasound therapy13; splint 
and cortisone injections11; splint and 
sham NM15; splint, advice, and tendon 
gliding exercises59; splint and paraffin 
therapy60; and splint, ultrasound, and 
transcutaneous electrical nerve stimula-
tion.86 The majority of studies evaluated 
the effect of 1 treatment session in which 
exercises were shown to patients, who 
were then instructed to continue for a pe-
riod of 1101 to 1088 weeks (see TABLE 4 for 
information on interventions).
The clinical outcome measures as-
sessed with meta-analyses were nonsig-
nificant (P>.11) (APPENDIX F, available at 
www.jospt.org). FIGURES 5 and 6 illustrate 
the meta-analyses for pain and disabil-
ity. Meta-analysis included studies with 
a high and low risk of bias. There were 
several studies that reported on Tinel’s 
sign and the Functional Status Score, but 
the heterogeneity was substantial (P<.1), 
and therefore a meta-analysis was not 
performed on these outcomes.63
In CTS, positive neurophysiological 
effects, such as decreased intraneural 
edema, decreased temporal summation, 
and median nerve latency, were observed 
in the groups that received NM.15,86,101

2. Ligament bowing at hamate
3. BCTQ
4. Pain (VAS)
5. Numbness (VAS)
6. Patient-Specific Functional 
Scale
The findings of this study suggest that 
a reduction in intraneural edema is a 
therapeutic mechanism of both nerve 
and tendon gliding exercises and 
splinting
The chronicity of the symptoms of the 
patients involved in this study and the 
short treatment period suggest that 
the reduction in intraneural edema is 
associated with the interventions rather 
than the result of the natural course 
of CTS
Signal intensity did not change in patients 
who were not treated
BCTQ: F1,17 = 16.70, P = .001; Patient-
Specific Functional Scale: F1,16 = 22.10, 
P<.001
Post hoc comparisons revealed that both 
groups improved significantly after 
1-wk intervention (all, P<.004). No 
significant interaction or main effects 
for pain intensity and numbness were 
found (all, P>.16)

effect (IG, 2.6; 2.25-2.95 and CG, 
0.5; 0.16-0.84; P<.001). It should 
be noted, however, that the groups 
differed significantly before starting the 
treatment cycle. Larger disturbances 
of 2-point discrimination sensation in 
symptomatic extremities occurred in 
the IG as compared with the CG. After 
a course of therapy, there were no sta-
tistically significant (P>.05) intergroup 
differences

(P<.05). Two studies37,42 with a high risk 
of bias compared NM and radial-head 
mobilization to exercise37 and to friction 
massage and exercise.42 One study42 re-
vealed significant improvements (P<.05) 
in elbow and neurodynamic test ROM 
following radial-head mobilization. The 
other study37 reported improved grip 
strength (P<.001), pressure pain thresh-
old (P = .031), and Patient-Rated Tennis 
Elbow Evaluation Questionnaire score (P 
= .027) in the group receiving NM. Due 
to differences in outcome measures and 
techniques used, a meta-analysis could 
not be performed.
Other Conditions
Four studies used NM for other conditions, 
including tarsal tunnel syndrome,66 plantar 
heel pain,93 cubital tunnel syndrome,109 and 
post–lumbar surgery (TABLE 6).102 Two stud-
ies had a low risk of bias,93,102 1 had unclear 
risk of bias,66 and 1 had a high risk of bias.109
The combination of SLR mobilization, 
deep calf massage, and exercises compared 
to ultrasound and exercise resulted in a 
significant improvement in pain (P = .034) 
in the plantar heel.93 Using SLR mobiliza-
tion with a tibial nerve bias, compared to 
exercises and supportive inserts, improved 
Tinel’s sign and 2-point discrimination 
(P<.05) in tarsal tunnel syndrome.66 In 
tarsal tunnel syndrome, a decrease was 
observed in sensory parameters, namely 
Tinel’s sign, light touch, and 2-point dis-
crimination values.66 Other outcomes, such 
as disability, muscle strength, and pressure 
and thermal pain thresholds, were not sig-
nificantly different between the NM and 
usual-care groups.66,93
Post–lumbar surgery patients received 
SLR mobilization and usual care com-
pared to usual care only.102 Neural mo-
bilization did not have added benefit to 
usual care post–lumbar surgery.102 Last, 
NM exercises109 did not result in im-
proved pain and disability (P>.05) when 
compared to a control group and a group 
of patients who received an elbow brace 
for cubital tunnel syndrome.
DISCUSSION
N
eural mobilization is effective 
in reducing pain and disability in 
certain neuromusculoskeletal con-
ditions. Conditions where NM can be rec-
ommended (JBI grades of evidence) are 
N-LBP, N-NAP, tarsal tunnel syndrome, 
and plantar heel pain. Currently, the 
available evidence is insufficient to sup-
port the use of NM for CTS, post–lumbar 
surgery, and cubital tunnel syndrome.
Nerve-Related Low Back Pain
Evidence for effective management of 
patients with N-LBP is scarce.70,92 Fur-
thermore, N-LBP is also a risk factor 
for chronicity,54 and therefore effective 
management is important. People with 
N-LBP distal to the buttocks, a positive 
slump test, and pain lasting longer than 
3 months had a significant and clinically 
relevant50 improvement in both pain 
and disability following NM.25,61,81 Using 
other forms of NM, such as SLR mobi-
lization,65 techniques aimed at opening 
the intervertebral foramina,78 bent-leg 
raise,87 and mobilization of tibial and 
femoral nerves,43 also resulted in im-
proved pain and disability. The findings 
of the review support the suggestion of 
a previous study100 that patient outcomes 
can be improved when treatment is tar-
geted at subgroups of patients with N-
LBP. A recent review on lower-quadrant 
NM for healthy populations and patients 
with low back pain also found that NM 
improved pain and disability.85 Neural 
mobilization exercises incorporating 
slump and SLR mobilization can be rec-
ommended for N-LBP.
Nerve-Related Neck and Arm Pain
As the evidence for nonsurgical manage-
ment of N-NAP is scarce,17,18,94 it is rec-
ommended that treatment be aimed at 
specific subgroups.94 Using cervical lat-
eral glide techniques for people with N-
NAP had a positive effect on pain, with a 
clinically meaningful effect size.1,26
The effect of NM on disability in N-
NAP also seems positive.7,55,84,89 However, 
as this was not measured consistently, no 
firm conclusions can be made. Measuring 
function in these patients is important, as 
they are more disabled than patients with 
nonspecific neck pain.38 Future studies 
should investigate function and disability 
using common outcome measures, such 
as the NDI or Patient-Specific Functional 
Scale.
Carpal Tunnel Syndrome
Neural mobilization for CTS did not 
show significant effects for the clinical 
outcomes assessed. This finding is sup-
ported by a recent review of the effect 
of nerve gliding exercises on CTS.10 The 
majority of studies had a low risk of bias, 
which should strengthen the confidence 
in the findings from a research method-
ological point of view. However, several 
studies gave patients home exercises with 
only 1 intervention before follow-up. One 
study had 3 interventions and a follow-
up at 11 months.11 Although these studies 
can inform clinicians about these types of 
treatment schemes, many clinicians favor 
a more progressive exercise regime with 
closer monitoring and follow-up. Perhaps 
as a consequence, some studies had high 
patient dropout rates.19,60 Furthermore, 
many studies3,11,13,19,59,60,88 evaluated ten-
sioning techniques. Given the decrease in 
blood circulation in the median nerve in 
CTS,16 along with increased neural mech-
anosensitivity in response to local inflam-
mation,41,51 increasing the tension in the 
nerve may further diminish circulation 
and aggravate symptoms. More studies 
that evaluate the effects of more modern 
NM concepts,28 including “sliding tech-
niques,” are required before conclusions 
can be reached regarding the effect of 
NM on CTS (and other conditions). Slid-
ing techniques resulted in a reduction in 
intraneural edema in CTS and improve-
ment in pain and function.101
Lateral Epicondylalgia
In a study with a low risk of bias, the use 
of cervical lateral glides improved pain in 
lateral epicondylalgia and can therefore 
be considered in the treatment of tennis

elbow.115 Due to the high risk of bias of 
the other studies,37,42 differences in tech-
niques used, and conflicting outcomes, 
it is not possible to make firm recom-
mendations on the use of NM for lateral 
epicondylalgia.
Other Conditions
Two studies support the use of SLR mo-
bilization for patients with plantar heel 
pain and tarsal tunnel syndrome.66,93 This 
is in accordance with other studies that 
illustrated that the SLR transmits move-
ment to the tibial nerve29 and can have an 
effect on pain, function, and movement 
of patients with subcalcaneal heel pain.80 
As this is supported by a low-risk-of-bias 
study, the use of NM for these conditions 
can be recommended.
Two studies102,109 found no added ben-
efit when using NM in addition to usual 
care for post–lumbar surgery and cubital 
tunnel syndrome. There is insufficient 
evidence for the use of NM in these con-
ditions, and more studies are needed.
Outcome Measures
In studies evaluating CTS and N-LBP, 
similar outcome measures were used, 
and therefore a meta-analysis could be 
performed. Unfortunately, this was not 
the case for most other conditions. Pain 
was measured in most studies, but the 
method of assessment was not consistent 
across studies. Future studies should con-
sider a core set of clinical outcome mea-
sures to evaluate the clinical effectiveness 
of these interventions.
Neurophysiological Effects
An improvement in neurophysiological 
parameters was observed in a number of 
studies, such as a decrease in intraneural 
edema.101 This observed decrease in intra-
neural edema is supported by 2 studies 
on unembalmed cadavers, which dem-
onstrated the ability of NM to disperse 
intraneural fluid.20,53 One of the aims of 
NM is to restore the homeostasis in and 
around the targeted nerve.34 As ischemia 
of the median nerve contributes to the 
symptoms of CTS,58 a decrease in intra-
neural edema is important in the man-
agement of CTS. Sensory parameters may 
also benefit from NM.66
NM Techniques
Two NM techniques consistently pro-
duced good results in conditions consid-
ered difficult to treat.73,94 Mobilization 
in slump improved pain and disabil-
ity in N-LBP,25,61,81,87 and cervical lateral 
glides improved pain in N-NAP and 
epicondylalgia.5,36,84,115
Our findings showed that tensioning 
techniques were useful in the treatment of 
chronic nerve-related conditions, such as 
N-LBP25 and plantar heel pain.66,93 More 
recently, however,28 sliding techniques 
have been typically advocated because 
they expose the nervous system to less 
strain and greater mobilization,28 which 
might be more advantageous when nerve 
mechanosensitivity is still increased.32 
Therefore, the choice of technique should 
be based on sound clinical reasoning.49,83 
Unfortunately, the reasoning process be-
hind the choice of techniques is absent or 
unclear in many studies.
The terminology can also be confus-
ing. Some studies explicitly state whether 
“sliding techniques” or “tensioning tech-
niques” were used,4,55,76 but other studies 
use the more generic term “nerve gliding 
exercises.” In order not to confuse generic 
“gliding” exercises with specific “sliding” 
exercises, we recommend to abandon the 
term “nerve gliding exercises” and use 
NM or “neurodynamic techniques” to re-
fer to techniques that aim to mobilize the 
nerve or its surrounding structures. The 
need for consistent use of terminology is 
evident.
Risk of Bias Across and Within Studies
This review was limited to the inclusion 
of randomized clinical trials. We in-
cluded all randomized trials, regardless 
of quality, in an endeavor to include all 
conditions treated and techniques used. 
Seventeen studies had a low risk of bias. 
Two non-English studies were identified 
but not included.9,71 Potential publication 
bias could not be assessed using funnel 
plots, as less than 10 trials were included 
in the meta-analyses.8
Strengths and Limitations
This study included an additional 20 
articles that were not included in the 
most comprehensive review to date.108 
An increase in studies on CTS, N-LBP, 
and N-NAP, and the ability to perform 
meta-analysis, provided a better overview 
of the clinical effectiveness of NM. How-
ever, there is still a paucity of information 
on many relevant conditions, such as cu-
bital tunnel syndrome and post–lumbar 
surgery.
Although authors were contacted 
when necessary, some authors could not 
be reached, and not all required infor-
mation was available. The majority of 
studies had low numbers of participants, 
and therefore results are not necessarily 
generalizable.
Recommendations
• Cervical lateral glide mobilization im-
proves pain in N-NAP (level A).
• Slump and SLR mobilization im-
proves pain and disability in N-LBP 
(level A).
• Neural mobilization has positive 
neurophysiological outcomes in CTS 
(upper-limb neurodynamic test 1) and 
N-LBP (slump and SLR) (level A).
• Neural mobilization does not have a 
positive effect on most of the clinical 
outcome measures in CTS (level A).
• Neural mobilization improves pain in 
tarsal tunnel syndrome and plantar 
heel pain (low-risk-of-bias evidence 
from a single study)
CONCLUSION
S
lump and SLR mobilization and a 
cervical lateral glide technique have 
 
been shown to improve pain and 
function in groups of patients who are often 
resistant to treatment, such as those with 
chronic N-LBP and N-NAP and plantar 
heel pain. The findings of this review may 
help inform guidelines on the management 
of CTS and low back and neck pain.UU

KEY POINTS
FINDINGS: Neural mobilization (NM) is 
effective in the management of nerve-
related low back pain, nerve-related 
neck and arm pain, and plantar heel 
pain and tarsal tunnel syndrome. Neu-
ral mobilization is not effective in the 
management of carpal tunnel syndrome. 
Positive neurophysiological effects were 
present in groups that received NM.
IMPLICATIONS: The findings of this review 
may help inform clinicians in regard 
to the management of chronic nerve-
related low back pain, nerve-related 
neck and arm pain, and plantar heel 
pain. Sound clinical reasoning remains 
essential when treating nerve-related 
conditions with NM.
CAUTION: Due to the limited evidence and 
often small study samples, conclusions 
may change over time.
