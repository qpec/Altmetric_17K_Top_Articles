Abstract
In human studies, how averaged activation in a brain region relates to human behavior has
been extensively investigated. This approach has led to the finding that positive and nega-
tive facial preferences are represented by different brain regions. However, using a func-
tional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) decoded neurofeedback (DecNef) method, we
found that different patterns of neural activations within the cingulate cortex (CC) play roles
in representing opposite directions of facial preference. In the present study, while neutrally
preferred faces were presented, multi-voxel activation patterns in the CC that corresponded
to higher (or lower) preference were repeatedly induced by fMRI DecNef. As a result, previ-
ously neutrally preferred faces became more (or less) preferred. We conclude that a differ-
ent activation pattern in the CC, rather than averaged activation in a different area,
represents and suffices to determine positive or negative facial preference. This new
approach may reveal the importance of an activation pattern within a brain region in many
cognitive functions.
Author Summary
Although it is well studied how averaged activation of a brain region relates to behavior, it
is still unclear if specific patterns of activation within regions also relate to cognitive func-
tion. In recent years, several methods have been developed for manipulating brain activity
in humans. Real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging decoded neurofeedback
(fMRI DecNef) is a method that allows the induction of specific patterns of brain activity
by measuring the current pattern, comparing this to the pattern to be induced, and giving
the subjects feedback on how close the two patterns of neuronal activity are. Using fMRI
DecNef, we manipulated the pattern of activation in the cingulate cortex—a part of the
cerebral cortex that plays a role in preference to different categories including faces and

 daily items—and tested whether we could change these preferences. In the experiment, a
specific activation pattern in the cingulate cortex corresponding to higher (or lower) pref-
erence was induced by fMRI DecNef while subjects were seeing a neutrally preferred face.
As a result, these neutrally preferred faces became more (or less) preferred. Our finding
suggests that different patterns of activation in the cingulate cortex represent, and are suf-
ficient to determine, different emotional states. Our new approach using fMRI DecNef
may reveal the importance of activation patterns within a brain region, rather than activa-
tion in a whole region, in many cognitive functions.
Introduction
A traditional approach in human studies is to examine how averaged activation in a brain
region relates to behavior. Results obtained by this approach led most theories of cognitive
functions in the human brain to assume that a different region or a group of regions in the
human brain play a role in a different function. Although this approach has greatly advanced
the understanding of neural mechanisms of human cognitive functions, it cannot effectively
reveal a differential role of a pattern of activity within the same region in a different cognitive
function. In animal studies, the importance of a role of activity of a certain group of neurons in
a region rather than mean activity of the region has been observed [1,2]. Thus, to better under-
stand neural mechanisms of human cognitive functions, it is necessary to investigate how a dif-
ferent pattern of activation within a region plays a different role.
Facial preferences influence a wide range of social outcomes from face perception to social
behavior [3–13] and, therefore, has been a subject of great interest. Theories of facial prefer-
ences have also been developed, with the general consensus that positive and negative facial
preferences are represented by different brain regions including the amygdala, basal ganglia,
insular cortex, occipitotemporal cortex, orbit frontal cortex, lateral prefrontal cortex, and cin-
gulate cortex (CC) [14–20]. The CC has also been reported to play roles in preference to differ-
ent categories including faces and daily items [21–23].
A recently developed online functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) decoded neuro-
feedback (DecNef) has allowed us to induce a different multi-voxel pattern of activation within
the same brain region [24]. In the present study, using fMRI DecNef, we tested whether a dif-
ferent pattern of activations within a single brain region can sufficiently change facial prefer-
ences in a positive or negative direction.
In the experiment, we chose the CC as the target brain region for fMRI DecNef because the
CC was found to be the best region whose multi-voxel activation patterns represent both posi-
tive and negative facial preferences in the current study (see below) among the regions previ-
ously implicated in facial preference [14–20]. We tested whether subjects’ preferences to
neutrally preferred faces could be changed toward a positive (or negative) direction by fMRI
DecNef, which induced multi-voxel activation patterns in the CC that correspond to higher (or
lower) preference with presentations of the neutrally rated faces to generate a new association
between the faces and manipulated preferences. As a result, the previously neutrally rated faces
became significantly more (or less) preferred. Although subjects’ facial preferences were suc-
cessfully changed, subjects remained unaware of the aim to change their facial preferences. On
the contrary to the previous belief that a different brain region plays a role in positive or nega-
tive facial preference, our results are in accord with the hypothesis that it is a different activa-
tion pattern in the CC that represents and suffices to determine positive or negative facial
preference.

 Results
Determination of the CC as a Target Region
To determine a single region that would be used as a target for fMRI DecNef, we first con-
ducted a pilot experiment (see Fig 1A, S1 Fig, and Pilot Experiment in Materials and Methods).
Results of the pilot experiment showed that the CC most accurately reflects subjects’ behavioral
preference ratings both in the negative and positive directions among the regions previously
implicated in facial preference (S1A Fig) [14–20]. Thus, we determined the CC as the target
region for fMRI DecNef in the main experiment.
Main Experiment with fMRI DecNef
This experimental design was made with the aim to test whether induction of activation pat-
terns in the CC, which represent higher (or lower) preference with presentations of neutrally
preferred faces, can make these faces more (or less) preferred. The main experiment consisted
of five stages (see Fig 1A and Main Experiment in Materials and Methods for details): pre-test
(1 d), fMRI decoder construction (1 d), induction (fMRI DecNef, 3 d), post-test (20 min after
the offset of the induction stage), and interview of subjects (immediately after the post-test
stage). In the pre-test stage, we measured a distribution of behavioral preference ratings to
faces for each subject. In the fMRI decoder construction stage, for each subject, we constructed
a preference decoder to estimate the preference ratings, which were represented by the activa-
tion patterns in the target region (the CC). In the induction stage, fMRI DecNef was adminis-
tered based on the preference decoder. Through fMRI DecNef, activation patterns in the CC
were made to be similar to specific patterns, which represent higher (or lower) preference

 ratings, in association with presentations of neutrally rated faces. In the post-test stage, sub-
jects’ behavioral preference ratings to the same faces as in the pre-test stage were measured so
that we could test whether behavioral preference ratings to the previously neutrally rated faces
were changed due to induction of the specific activation patterns in the CC.
In the pre-test stage, subjects’ behavioral preference ratings to 400 face pictures were mea-
sured. In each trial (Fig 1B), after the brief presentation of each face, subjects determined their
preference to the face on a scale of one to ten (one for the lowest, ten for the highest) during a 6
s rating period. In a subsequent reporting period, they were asked to report the determined
preference rating.
Based on the behavioral preference ratings recorded in the pre-test stage, we selected neu-
trally rated faces, which would be used in the subsequent stages. For each subject, one set of 15
neutrally rated faces was randomly selected for use in the induction stage and called “induction
faces.” Another set of 15 neutrally rated faces was also randomly selected as “baseline faces” for
a control set, which was not shown during the induction stage. Because both induction and
baseline faces were neutrally rated in the pre-test stage, the average behavioral ratings were the
same between the two sets of faces in the pre-test stage. Thus, comparison of changes in the
behavioral preference ratings between the induction and baseline faces in the post-test stage
would indicate whether pairings of specific activation patterns in the CC with the induction
faces during the induction stage are sufficient to change the behavioral preference ratings to
the induction faces.
In the fMRI decoder construction stage, we constructed the preference decoder (sparse lin-
ear regression [25]), which would be used during the subsequent induction stage for the target
region (the CC). In the fMRI decoder construction stage, subjects again conducted the prefer-
ence-rating task in the fMRI scanner (see Fig 1B and Main Experiment in Materials and Meth-
ods). Based on the fMRI signals measured during the rating period and corresponding
behavioral preference ratings for each subject, we constructed the preference decoder to esti-
mate the subject’s behavioral preference ratings from activation patterns in the CC.
The purpose of the three-day induction stage was to associate the induction faces with spe-
cific activation patterns in the CC that represent higher (or lower) preference ratings through
fMRI DecNef using the preference decoder. Subjects were randomly assigned to either a
higher-preference (n = 12) or lower-preference (n = 12) group but were not informed of their
assigned group. Each trial consisted of face, induction, fixation, feedback, and inter-trial peri-
ods (Fig 1C). During the face period, subjects were presented with one of the induction faces.
In the induction period, subjects were instructed to somehow regulate their brain activity to
make the size of a solid green disk (presented in the subsequent feedback period) as large as
possible. Subjects were encouraged to enlarge the disk size so that they would receive a pay-
ment bonus proportional to the mean disk size. Subjects were given no further instructions.
The size of the disk presented in the feedback period served as a feedback signal and reflected
an estimated preference rating from the CC, which was calculated by applying the preference
decoder to the activation pattern of the CC obtained in the preceding induction period of the
trial (see Main Experiment in Materials and Methods for details). However, the computation
of the disk size was opposite in its direction between the two groups, although the instructions
given to the two groups were exactly the same. For the higher-preference group, the disk size
was proportional to the estimated rating from the CC activation pattern. That is, if the CC acti-
vation became more similar to the patterns corresponding to higher preference, the disk size
became larger. In contrast, for the lower-preference group, a lower estimated rating made the
disk larger. This made the instruction and the range of feedback signals to both groups identi-
cal. Note that all other information, including the intended preference direction, the purpose of
the induction stage, and the meaning of the disk size, was withheld from subjects so that

 knowledge of the purpose of the experiment would not influence subjects’ rating criteria in the
post-test stage.
Changes in Behavioral Preference Rating as a Result of fMRI DecNef
To confirm that subjects’ behavioral preference ratings to the induction faces changed as a
result of associations of the induction faces with CC activation patterns of higher (higher-pref-
erence group) or lower (lower-preference group) preference ratings during the induction stage,
the following three criteria have to be satisfied. First, subjects’ preference ratings as behavioral
measures for originally neutrally rated induction faces must be significantly higher with the
higher-preference group and lower with the lower-preference group in the post-test stage than
in the pre-test stage. Second, to rule out the effect of mere exposure to faces on preferences to
the faces [26], the subjects’ behavioral preference ratings must be unchanged simply by
repeated exposures to the faces during the fMRI decoder construction and induction stages.
Thus, a new group of subjects as a control group (n = 6) underwent an experiment in which
visual presentations were identical to those for the higher- and lower-preference groups while
no fMRI DecNef was administered (see Main Experiment in Materials and Methods for
details). Third, changes in subjects’ behavioral preference ratings after the induction stage must
occur specifically for the induction faces but not for the baseline faces, which were originally
neutrally rated but were not used during the induction stage.
To test if the results of the main experiment met these criteria, a three-way mixed-model
ANOVA with factors being test stage (pre- versus post-test stages), face type (induction versus
baseline faces), and group (higher-preference, lower-preference versus control groups) was
applied to the behavioral preference ratings (Fig 2). The main effects of test stage (F1,27 = 4.61,
p = 0.04) and group (F2,27 = 3.56, p = 0.04) were significant. Significant interactions were
obtained between test stage and group (F2,27 = 8.31, p < 10−2), between face type and group
(F2,27 = 10.84, p < 10−3), between test stage and face type (F1,27 = 4.63, p = 0.04), and among
the three factors (F2,27 = 13.10, p = 10−4). Post hoc t-tests revealed that, in the post-test stage,
subjects’ behavioral preference ratings to the induction faces were significantly higher for the
higher-preference group (Fig 2, red; paired two-tailed t-test, t11 = 4.78, p < 10−3; Bonferroni

 corrected) and significantly lower for the lower-preference group (Fig 2, blue; t11 = 3.31,
p < 10−2, Bonferroni corrected) than in the pre-test stage. The results meet the first criterion.
Moreover, post hoc t-tests showed no significant changes in subjects’ behavioral preference rat-
ings between the two test stages for the control group (Fig 2, gray; t5 = 0.69, p = 0.52), meeting
the second criterion. For all of the three groups, no significant change in subjects’ behavioral
preference ratings was observed for the baseline faces, which were neutrally rated in the pre-
test stage but not presented during the induction stage, meeting the third criterion (Fig 2, base-
line faces; t11 = 1.15, p = 0.27 for the higher-preference group; t11 = 0.45, p = 0.66 for the lower-
preference group; t5 = 0.72, p = 0.50 for the control group). From all of these results, we con-
clude that association of originally neutrally rated faces with covert induction of activity pat-
terns in the single brain region, the CC, led to changes in facial preference specifically for those
faces and in a specific preference (positive or negative) direction.
Subjects Were Unaware of What the Disk Size Represented
It is important that subjects were unaware of our manipulation and what the disk size repre-
sented, because knowledge or suspicion of what the disk size represented could have signifi-
cantly influenced subjects’ rating criteria. In the interview stage, which was held right after the
post-test stage, subjects from the higher- and lower-preference groups were asked whether they
knew or suspected what the disk size represented and what, if anything, they tried to do to
increase the disk size. None of their responses indicated even a slightest understanding of the
true workings of the experiment (see S1 Data for details). Subjects were then debriefed on how
the disk size was computed and were asked to guess whether they had been assigned to the
higher- or lower-preference group. The accuracies of their guesses were indistinguishable from
chance for the higher-preference (Chi-square test, χ = 0.17, p = 0.68) and lower-preference (χ
= 0.00, p = 1.00) groups (Fig 3). These results of the interview stage suggest that subjects
remained unaware of what the disk size represented. That is, it was beyond subjects’ will that

which group they had been assigned for the higher- (n = 12) and lower- (n = 12) preference groups,

 induction of specific activation patterns in the single region changed facial preference in a spe-
cific (positive or negative) direction.
Effects of Inductions of a Pattern of Activation on the Changes in the
Behavioral Preference Ratings
The present study tested whether subjects’ behavioral preference ratings to the neutrally rated
faces can be altered by repetitive inductions of a certain pattern of activation within the same
region. We found that the behavioral preference ratings to the neutrally rated faces were indeed
changed in the post-test stage from the pre-test stage (Fig 2). If activation patterns in the CC
during the induction stage resulted in the changes in the behavioral preference ratings, there
should be a quantitative relationship between the induced shifts in activation patterns in the
CC during the induction stage and the observed changes in subjects’ behavioral preference rat-
ings in the post-test stage.
To examine this relationship, we first quantified the activation patterns in the CC during
the induction stage as described in (1), and called the metric induced CC-activation shifts.
Then, we tested the prediction that the degree of the induced CC-activation shift should be cor-
related with the degree of the behavioral preference rating change as described in (2).
(1) Calculating CC-activation shifts during the induction stage.
The CC-activation shift
was calculated using the preference decoder in the following ways. As mentioned above, the
preference-related component of an activation pattern in the CC in the induction stage was
represented as an estimated preference rating by the preference decoder (see Main Experiment
in Materials and Methods for details). The preference decoder was constructed based on the
individual behavioral preference ratings obtained during the fMRI decoder construction stage
for each subject. The average behavioral preference rating varied with a different subject during
the fMRI decoder construction stage. Therefore, to appropriately evaluate and compare the
induced shifts in activation patterns in the CC during the induction stage across subjects or
groups of subjects, we subtracted the abovementioned average behavioral preference rating
during the fMRI decoder construction stage from the estimated preference rating from the CC
during the induction stage for each subject. The resultant value of the subtraction is called an
induced CC-activation shift. That is, an induced CC-activation shift represents how far an
induced activation pattern in the CC during the induction stage was shifted away from the acti-
vation pattern for the average behavioral preference rating for each subject (see Main Experi-
ment in Materials and Methods for detailed description of the induced CC-activation shift).
For instance, a "0" induced CC-activation shift indicates that the activation pattern of the CC
was biased in neither the positive nor negative preference direction.
If the induced shifts in the activation patterns in the CC during the induction stage led to
the observed changes in the behavioral preference ratings between the pre- and post-test stages,
the induced CC-activation shifts should have a quantitative relationship to the behavioral pref-
erence rating changes.
(2) Testing of the prediction.
The following results support the abovementioned predic-
tion that there is a quantitative relationship between induced CC-activation shifts and changes
in the behavioral preference ratings. We found a significant correlation between the changes in
subjects’ behavioral preference rating and the induced CC-activation shifts averaged over the
three-day induction stage (Fig 4; Pearson’s correlation test, r22 = 0.78, p < 10−4). Importantly,
the correlation coefficient remained significant if the group effect (higher- or lower-preference
group) was removed by reversing the sign of the data for the lower-preference group (S2 Fig,
r22 = 0.57, p < 10−2). Moreover, as described below, the close-to-zero intercept and positive
slope of the regression line (Fig 4) suggest a quantitatively close one-to-one relationship of the

 induced CC-activation shifts to the changes in the behavioral preference ratings. The zero
intercept of the regression line indicates that if an induced CC-activation shift was zero (in
other words, activation patterns corresponding to higher or lower preference ratings did not
occur in the CC), then no behavioral change occurred. The positive slope of the regression line
means that if the induced CC-activation shift is positive (or negative), the behavioral change is
also positive (or negative). Third, the slope was close to one. This indicates that the magnitude
of the behavioral preference change was almost equivalent to that of the induced CC-activation
shift. These results suggest that a different pattern of activation in the CC changed facial prefer-
ence in a positive or negative direction.
The Differential Activation Patterns in the CC Can Explain the Bi-
directional Changes in the Behavioral Preference Rating While Mere
Pairing of Faces with Monetary Reward Cannot Account for the Bi-
directional Behavioral Changes
We found significant bi-directional changes in the subjects’ behavioral preference ratings to
the induction faces in the post-test stage from the pre-test stage (Fig 2). In addition, the results
of the quantitative analysis (Fig 4 and S2 Fig) suggested that a different activation pattern
induced in the CC during the induction stage determined a direction and degree of the changes
in subjects’ behavioral preference ratings to the induction faces. However, is there any possibil-
ity that pairings of the induction faces with the monetary reward during the induction stage
directly led to the subjects’ behavioral preference rating changes in the post-test stage without
relying on the differential activation patterns induced in the CC? This possibility arises because
payment bonus (monetary reward) was given to subjects in proportion to the size of the green
feedback disk during the induction stage. However, the following lines of evidence do not sup-
port this possibility.

the behavioral preference ratings. Here shown is the scatter plot of the induced CC-activation shift during
the three-day induction stage versus the change in subjects’ behavioral preference rating for the higher- (red

plot (Grubbs’ test, p > 0.05). The black cross and broken line indicate the origin (0, 0) and the ordinary least-
square regression, respectively. See S2 Fig for more details regarding the removal of the group effect.

 First, the lack of difference in the amounts of monetary reward between the higher- and
lower-preference groups is inconsistent with the model that the amount of reward should
simply increase the preference. Assume that monetary reward was a direct deterministic
factor to make faces more preferred. Then the amount of the payment bonus given to the
higher-preference group should have been larger than the lower-preference group, because
the behavioral preference rating increased in the higher-preference group and decreased in
the lower-preference group (Fig 2). However, there was no significant difference in the
amounts of the payment bonus between the higher- and lower-preference groups (Fig 5A;
two-sample two-tailed t-test, t22 = 0.19, p = 0.85). Second, if monetary reward was a direct
deterministic factor to make faces more preferred, the amount of the payment bonus
should have been correlated with the degree of the behavioral preference rating change
across the two groups. However, no significant correlation was found between them (Fig
5B; r22 = 0.15, p = 0.49). Third, if hypothesis for the direct role of reward is true, then the
amount of the payment bonus should have been positively correlated with the estimated
preference rating by the decoder from the CC activation patterns in each of the higher- and
lower-preference groups. Indeed, the estimated rating from the CC activation pattern was
positively correlated with the amount of the payment bonus in the higher-preference group
(Fig 5C; red diamonds). However, the estimated rating was negatively correlated with the
amount of payment bonus in the lower-preference group (Fig 5C; blue circle). These corre-
lations reflect the experimental procedure for the induction stage (see Main Experiment in
Materials and Methods). These lines of evidence clearly deny the possibility that monetary
reward during the induction stage was the direct factor to induce both positive and negative
preferences. They also support the conclusion that it is the differential activation patterns
induced in the CC that led to the bi-directional changes in the behavioral preference
ratings.

 Induction of the Preference-Related Activation Patterns Was Largely
Confined to the CC
The present results suggest that the different activation patterns in the CC resulted in different
directions of facial preference. How can we know that the CC mainly determines the facial
preference? The size of the feedback disk provided to subjects in the induction stage was based
on activation patterns only in the CC. However, this procedure alone does not assure that
inductions of the preference-related activation patterns were confined to the CC. It is possible
that, in concert with the successful induction of specific activation patterns in the CC, similar
activation patterns occurred in some other regions during the induction stage, which might
also contribute to the behavioral preference rating changes. If the activation patterns in the CC
that represented higher (or lower) preference ratings “leaked out” and induced similar prefer-
ence-related activation patterns in other regions, the activation patterns in these regions should
reconstruct the estimated ratings based on the CC activation patterns on a trial-by-trial basis.
To test the possibility that preference-related activation patterns in the CC leaked out of the
CC to other regions, we conducted two leak analyses. In the first analysis (see Leak analysis
using an ROI-based method for details), we anatomically divided the whole brain into a total
of 38 regions (the CC and 37 other regions) and compared the amounts of leakage in the 38
regions. In the second analysis (see Leak analysis using a searchlight method for details), using
a searchlight method [27], we mapped the amount of leakage by moving a searchlight sphere
throughout the whole brain during the fMRI decoder construction stage and induction stage
and compared these maps. We describe details of these two leak analyses below.
In the first leak analysis, we tested whether the estimated ratings based on the CC activation
patterns were reconstructed using activation patterns measured in each of the aforementioned
37 other brain regions during the induction stage, as well as activation patterns in the CC itself
as a control. We defined reconstruction performance as a correlation coefficient between the
reconstructed values and the estimated ratings based on the CC activation patterns (see Leak
analysis using an ROI-based method in Materials and Methods for details). A high correlation
coefficient would indicate that there was leakage of the CC activation patterns to the other
brain regions. However, the Fisher-transformed correlation coefficients for the other 37 regions
(Fig 6, gray) were significantly and markedly smaller than that for the CC itself (Fig 6, red;
paired two-tailed t-test on z-scores of the correlation coefficients after permutation [28], t23 >
13.26, p < 10−11, Bonferroni corrected; see Permutation Test in Materials and Methods for
details of calculation of the z-scores). If activation patterns in other brain regions had been
closely linked to those in the CC, the correlation coefficients should have been as high as those
in the CC. Therefore, our results indicate that it is unlikely that the activation patterns induced
in the CC leaked out to other regions.
In the second leak analysis, using a searchlight method (see Leak analysis using a searchlight
method for details), we examined how well activation patterns of voxels in a moving searchlight
sphere can reconstruct the estimated ratings in the CC (1) while subjects were conducting the
preference-rating task in the fMRI decoder construction stage and (2) while they were going
through the induction stage. A comparison of the results between the fMRI decoder construction
stage and induction stage should clarify that preference-related activation patterns were confined
to the CC during the induction stage. During the fMRI decoder construction stage, the CC and
several other regions showed significant and high reconstruction performances on the recon-
struction of the estimated ratings based on activation patterns in the CC (Fig 7A). This result
demonstrated that the searchlight method possesses a sufficient power of sensitivity for detecting
leaking of preference-related activation patterns out of the CC to other regions. However, during
the induction stage, significant and high reconstruction performances were found only for voxels

 within the CC (Fig 7B). Although a few regions in the prefrontal and parietal cortices showed sig-
nificant reconstruction performance in reconstruction, these performances were much lower
than those in the voxels within the CC. These results obtained by the searchlight analysis indicate
the following two points. First, when subjects conducted the preference-rating task in the fMRI
decoder construction stage, preference-related activation patterns in the CC leaked out of the CC
to several other regions. Second, during the induction stage, there was little leakage of preference-
related activation patterns out of the CC to other regions.
These two leak analyses collectively and consistently demonstrate that the preference-
related activation patterns were indeed largely confined to the CC during the induction stage.
We conclude that the behavioral rating changes due to fMRI DecNef ware mainly induced by
activation patterns within the CC.
Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first study in which manipulation of a different brain activation
pattern in a single region successfully changed facial preferences in the positive or negative

combined (n = 24).

 direction. Previous neuroscientific approaches have revealed that a different region or a group
of regions is involved in positive or negative facial preference [14–20] and developed the gen-
eral consensus that positive and negative facial preferences are represented by different brain
regions. Contrary to this general consensus, the present results using fMRI DecNef [24] indi-
cated a case in which highly selective activity patterns in the single brain region represent and
suffice to determine both positive and negative facial preferences.
Additionally, our control analyses provide two important insights. First, the facial prefer-
ence was not necessarily increased by a larger amount of monetary reward. Especially in the
lower-preference group, the higher the monetary reward was, the less liked faces were. Second,
when the CC was solely manipulated by fMRI DecNef during the induction stage, the effect of
the manipulation on other brain regions was minimal or negligible. Together, the present
results suggest that the induced activation pattern within the CC played a crucial role in chang-
ing the facial preference.
Based on the abovementioned results, we argue that a different activation pattern mainly in
the CC as a single region represents positive or negative facial preference. However, one may
raise the possibility that the activation patterns for positive and negative facial preference are
spatially distributed in different subregions of the CC. We tested whether this is the case. We
found that there is no significant difference in the extent of spatial distributions in the CC
between positive and negative facial preferences (see S3 Fig for details). Thus, it is unlikely that
a different subregion of the CC represents each of the positive and negative facial preferences.

 These results are in accord with the hypothesis that positive and negative facial preferences are
represented by spatially overlapped but different activation patterns in the CC.
Are changed activations in the CC during the induction period specific to facial preference? If
so, activation changes during the induction period should be more related to the facial preference
than any other period of a trial. To test this possibility, we analyzed activation patterns in the CC
during the fixation period as well as the inter-trial period of the induction stage and compared
them with activation patterns in the induction period (see Fig 1C for time course of a trial in the
induction stage). In particular, we applied the preference decoder to the activation patterns dur-
ing the fixation as well as inter-trial periods and calculated the induced CC-activation shifts as in
the induction period (S4 Fig). During the induction period, the induced CC-activation shifts for
the higher- and lower-preference groups were significantly different from zero (S4A Fig). In con-
trast, during the fixation period (S4B Fig) or inter-trial period (S4C Fig), the induced CC-activa-
tion shifts were not significantly different from zero. These results are consistent with the
possibility that changed activations in the CC during the induction period were specific to facial
preference rather than related to other functions or states including general emotion.
One may also wonder whether the significant shifts in induced CC-activations during the
induction period (Fig 4 and S4A Fig) were simply due to changes in the overall mean activation
amplitudes in the CC rather than induced multi-voxel activation patterns associated with higher or
lower facial preferences. To test this possibility, we calculated the overall mean amplitudes across
voxels in the CC during the induction period for both the higher- and lower-preference groups
over the three-day induction stage (see S5 Fig for details) and compared the mean amplitudes
between the two groups. There was no significant difference in the mean amplitudes between the
groups. We also found that in neither group the overall mean activation amplitude was significantly
different from zero on any day of the induction stage. These results suggest that the behavioral rat-
ing changes toward higher- and lower-preference resulted from induction of certain activation pat-
terns in the CC rather than changes in the overall mean activation amplitudes in the CC.
It has been found that a number of brain regions are involved in facial preferences [14–20].
Why was the CC in particular selected as the target region for fMRI DecNef to change subjects’
facial preferences? An important purpose of the current study was to test whether a different
pattern of activity in a single brain region changes facial preference in an opposite direction. In
the aforementioned pilot experiment, we found that the CC is the best region that codes both
positive and negative facial preferences depending on the pattern of activation within the CC.
Although the prefrontal cortex plays an important role in facial preferences in studies using a
univariate analysis, it has been found that a different part of the prefrontal cortex is involved in
each of the positive and negative facial preference coding [18]. Thus, the criterion for the selec-
tion of the CC was not based on whether the CC is the most important region for facial prefer-
ence but rather was based on the fact that the CC was found to code both positive and negative
facial preferences in the current study.
In summary, the results of the present study indicate that highly selective activity patterns
for higher or lower preference within the CC that were repeatedly paired with facial stimuli
lead to changes in subjects’ facial preferences. Although these results do not deny important
roles of other regions in facial preference, our study clearly demonstrates that inductions of dif-
ferent patterns of activation within the CC suffice to determine changes of facial preference in
opposite directions beyond subjects’ will [29].

 Subjects
Thirty-three naïve subjects (19 to 29 years old; 23 males and 10 females) with normal or cor-
rected-to-normal vision participated in the study. All experiments and data analyses were con-
ducted in ATR. All subjects gave written informed consents.
Pilot Experiment
The purpose of the pilot experiment was to determine a target region of interest (ROI) to be
used in the main experiment. Three subjects participated in the pilot experiment. The complete
experiment consisted of two stages: pre-test (1 d) and fMRI decoder construction (1 d). The
two stages were separated by at least 24 h.
Only behavioral data were collected from the pre-test stage, during which subjects’ behav-
ioral preference ratings to face pictures were measured. Subjects performed a preference-rating
task (Fig 1B) for a total of 400 trials across 20 runs. During each run, subjects were asked to fix-
ate on a white bull’s-eye presented at the center of the display. A brief break period was pro-
vided after each run upon a subject’s request.
We used a pool of 400 face pictures (200 males, 200 females, of a variety of races and ages)
collected from several open databases [30–35]. A stimulus primarily consisted of a face and
usually included some body parts, including hair, a neck, and shoulders, as well as a back-
ground scene. Each face picture was 4° square in size. The order of presentation of faces was
randomized for each subject.
Each trial (Fig 1B) consisted of a face period (0.5 s), a rating period (6 s), and a reporting
period, in the respective order. During the face period, a face picture was presented for 0.5 s at
the center of the display. During the rating period, only a fixation point was presented at the cen-
ter. Subjects were instructed to rate their preference to the previously presented face on a ten-
point scale (one for the lowest preference, ten for the highest preference). During the reporting
period, subjects were asked to report the preference rating by pressing two buttons (left and
right) on a keyboard using the index and middle fingers of their right hand. At the beginning of
the reporting period, a random number from one to ten was selected and presented at the center
of the display. Subjects were asked to adjust its value to their preference rating, pressing the left
button to increment it. Values were “wrapped” so that when subjects attempted to increment
past a value of ten, values would start over at one. Subjects completed the reporting period by
pressing the right button. After completion of the reporting period, the next trial began.
For each subject, 240 of the 400 face pictures were selected to be used for the subsequent
fMRI decoder construction stage. Selections for pictures were based on subjects’ individual
behavioral preference ratings in the pre-test stage: 100 highest-rated faces, 100 lowest-rated
faces, and 40 neutrally rated faces.
In the fMRI decoder construction stage, we measured subjects’ blood-oxygen-level depen-
dent (BOLD) signal patterns (see MRI Measurements and Parameters) while they once again
conducted the preference-rating task on the 240 face pictures selected from the pre-test stage
(the 100 highest-rated faces, 100 lowest-rated faces, and 40 neutrally rated faces). The mea-
sured BOLD signal patterns and behavioral preference ratings were in turn used to compute
parameters for a preference decoder for each of the different ROIs (see below). Task proce-
dures were identical to those of the pre-test stage except that an inter-trial period was added
to the end of each trial, in which only a white fixation point was presented at the center of the
display (Fig 1B). Subjects were asked to report their ratings within the reporting period (max-
imum of 5.5 s). The duration of the inter-trial period varied across trials, depending on sub-
jects’ reporting time, so that the total duration of the reporting and inter-trial periods would
be equal to 5.5 s.

 Each fMRI run for the fMRI decoder construction stage consisted of 20 task trials (one
trial = 12 s) plus a 10 s fixation period before the trials and a 2 s fixation period after the trials
(one run = 252 s). The fMRI data for the initial 10 s were discarded to allow the longitudinal
magnetization to reach equilibrium. Subjects conducted a total of 240 trials in 12 fMRI runs. A
presentation order for the abovementioned 240 face pictures was randomized for each subject.
Throughout each fMRI run, subjects were asked to fixate on a white bull’s-eye presented at the
center of the display. A brief break period was provided after each fMRI run upon a subject’s
request.
Recorded fMRI data were preprocessed using the BrainVoyager QX software [36]. All func-
tional images underwent 3-D motion correction. No spatial or temporal smoothing was
applied. Rigid-body transformations were performed to align the functional images to the
structural image for each subject. A gray matter mask was used to extract BOLD signals only
from gray matter voxels for further analysis.
We specified seven ROIs implicated in facial preference [14–20] according to anatomical
data for each subject: the cingulate cortex (CC), lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC), orbitofrontal
cortex (OFC), occipitotemporal cortex, insular cortex, basal ganglia, and amygdala. LPFC was
defined as the middle frontal gyrus plus the inferior frontal sulcus. OFC was defined as the
orbital gyrus plus the orbital sulci. The occipitotemporal cortex was defined as the lateral occi-
pitotemporal gyrus, the medial occipitotemporal gyrus, plus the occipitotemporal sulcus. The
basal ganglia were defined as the caudate, the pallidum, the putamen, plus the nucleus accum-
bens. Voxels from the left and right hemispheres were merged for each ROI. The cortical
regions were specified using an atlas on the BrainVoyager QX software [36]. A cortical surface
for each subject was spatially normalized into a standard cortical surface using a cortex-based
alignment method [37]. Then, the specified regions were projected into a native space for each
subject. The subcortical regions were specified for each subject using an automated brain par-
cellation method [38] on the Freesurfer software (http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu).
A time-course of BOLD signal intensities was extracted from each voxel in each ROI and
shifted by 4 s to account for the hemodynamic delay using the Matlab software. A linear trend
was removed from the time-course. The time-course was z-score normalized for each voxel
using all time points except for those for the initial 10 s in each fMRI run. This normalization
was aimed to minimize baseline differences in time-courses of BOLD signal intensities across
the fMRI runs. The data samples for computing the decoder were created by averaging the
BOLD signal intensities of each voxel for three volumes corresponding to the 6 s rating period.
To construct a preference decoder for each ROI, we used a sparse linear regression algo-
rithm [25], which automatically selected the relevant voxels within an ROI for decoding. Note
that the behavioral preference ratings measured in this study were non-linear. Although they
ranged from one to ten, preference measurement on the Likert-type scale cannot be considered
strictly linear. Thus, before applying the sparse linear regression for each ROI, the behavioral
preference ratings were linearized using an arc hyperbolic tangent function. An estimated rat-
ing Rdecoded, that is, the decoder output calculated based on an activation pattern for a trial, was
obtained in each ROI by
Rdecoded ¼ WT
voxel � Avoxel þ b:
Here, Avoxel represents the activation pattern of voxels in the ROI for the trial. Wvoxel indicates
linear weights for the voxels, which were optimized by the sparse linear regression algorithm
based on fMRI data, which was used for training the decoder. b corresponds to the decoder’s
constant term, which was determined for each subject as his/her average behavioral preference
rating across all faces in the preference-rating task during the fMRI decoder construction stage.

 Avoxel and Wvoxel are denoted as n-dimensional column vectors with n as the number of voxels
in each ROI. T denotes matrix transpose. The inputs to the decoder were subjects’ moment-to-
moment brain activations in each ROI, whereas the outputs from the decoder represented the
decoder’s best estimate of the corresponding behavioral preference ratings.
Decoder performance for each ROI was defined as the correlation coefficient between actual
subjects’ behavioral preference ratings in the preference-rating task and the estimated ratings
calculated from activation patterns of the ROI and evaluated by a leave-one-run-out cross vali-
dation procedure. In the cross-validation procedure, the pairs of the actual subjects’ behavioral
preference ratings and the activation patterns for the ROI measured on one fMRI run were
treated as the test data (20 samples), whereas those measured on the remaining runs (220 sam-
ples) were used for training the decoder to estimate subjects’ trial-by-trial behavioral preference
ratings. Thus, 12 cross-validation sets were generated per subject. For each voxel, activation
amplitudes of the training and test data were normalized by mean and variance of activation
amplitudes of the training data so that mean and variance of voxel activation amplitudes corre-
sponding to the induction period would be zero and one, respectively. The correlation coeffi-
cients for each ROI were first standardized using Fisher’s transformation, averaged over the
cross-validation sets, and then averaged across subjects, as shown in S1A Fig.
The result of the fMRI decoder construction stage showed that the highest decoder perfor-
mance was obtained from the CC (S1A Fig). Consistent with this result, previous neuroimaging
studies have reported that the CC is highly involved in facial preference [15,18,39] as well as
preferential decision-making in general [21–23]. Thus, we selected the CC as the target region
for the main experiment. Note that the highest decoder performance was also found in the CC
when we evaluated decoder performance in the same way using the fMRI signals obtained in
the fMRI decoder construction stage of the main experiment (S1B Fig). These results indicate
robustness of the tendency in which the CC most accurately reflects subjects’ facial preference
in the preference-rating task in this study.
Main Experiment
Thirty subjects participated in the main experiment. The main experiment consisted of five
stages: pre-test (1 d), fMRI decoder construction (1 d), induction (fMRI DecNef, 3 d), post-test
(20 min after the induction stage), and interview (immediately after the post-test stage) stages,
in this order (Fig 1A). The pre-test, fMRI decoder construction, and induction stages were sep-
arated by at least 24 h. Thirty subjects in the main experiment were randomly assigned to one
of the higher-preference (n = 12), lower-preference (n = 12), and control (n = 6) groups. They
were not informed about their assigned group.
The procedures of the pre- and post-test stages in the main experiment were identical to
those of the pre-test stage in the pilot experiment. As in the pilot experiment, the 100 highest-
rated faces, the 100 lowest-rated faces, and 40 neutrally rated faces were selected to be used in
the subsequent fMRI decoder construction stage. In addition, out of the 40 neutrally rated
faces, 15 were randomly selected for use in the induction stage (“induction faces”) and another
set of 15 was also randomly selected as a preference-matched control against the induction
faces (“baseline faces”). The baseline faces were not shown during the subsequent induction
stage.
For the higher- and lower-preference groups, the procedures of the fMRI decoder construc-
tion stage in the main experiment were identical to those in the pilot experiment (see Pilot
Experiment). A preference decoder for the CC was computed for each subject for use in the
subsequent induction stage. To train the decoder, we used 240 data samples obtained from the
240 trials in the 12 fMRI runs. For each voxel, activation amplitudes of the training data were

 normalized by the mean and the variance of activation amplitudes of the training data so that
the mean and the variance of voxel activation amplitudes would be zero and one, respectively.
The mean (± s.e.m.) numbers of voxels selected by the sparse linear regression algorithm to
decode the subjects’ preference ratings were 219.8 ± 0.5 across subjects. Note that because the
decoder was built based on data samples from all the trials in the fMRI decoder construction
stage, a unique set of voxels was selected for each subject.
For the control group, the visual presentations in the fMRI decoder construction stage were
identical to those in the pilot experiment while the experiment was conducted outside the MRI
scanner without fMRI measurements.
In the induction stage, which consisted of three daily sessions, subjects from the higher- and
lower-preference groups were instructed to regulate the activation of their brains, which were
controlled by an online fMRI technique [24,40–43]. On each day, subjects participated in up to
12 fMRI runs. The mean (± s.e.m.) number of runs per day was 10.8 ± 0.2. Each fMRI run for
the induction stage consisted of 15 trials (one trial = 20 s) preceded by a 30 s fixation period
(one run = 330 s). The fMRI data for the initial 10 s were discarded to allow the longitudinal
magnetization to reach equilibrium. During each run, subjects were instructed to fixate on a
white bull’s-eye presented at the center of the display. After each fMRI run, a brief break period
was provided upon a subject’s request.
Each trial in the induction stage (Fig 1C) consisted of a face period (0.5 s), an induction
period (6 s), a fixation period (6 s), a feedback period (2 s), and an inter-trial period (5.5 s), in
that order. During the face period, one of the 15 induction faces described above was presented
for 0.5 s at the center of the display. The order of presentation of the 15 induction faces was
randomized for each fMRI run. During the induction period, the color of the fixation point
changed from white to green, and no visual stimulus except for the fixation point was pre-
sented. Subjects were instructed to regulate activation of their brain, with the goal of making
the size of a solid green disk presented in the later feedback period as large as possible. The
experimenters provided no further instructions or strategies. During the fixation period, sub-
jects were asked simply to fixate on the central white point. This period was inserted between
the induction period and the feedback period to compensate for the known hemodynamic
delay, which we assumed lasted 4 s, during which activation patterns in the CC were calculated
in time for a green disk to be shown in the subsequent feedback period. The feedback period
presented the green disk for 2 s. The size of the disk was determined based on the estimated rat-
ing (see below), which is the decoder output value based on the BOLD signal pattern of the CC
measured in the prior induction period. The green disk was always enclosed by a larger green
concentric circle (10° in diameter), which indicated the disk’s possible maximum size. The
feedback period was followed by the inter-trial period, during which subjects were asked to fix-
ate on the central white point. This period was followed by the start of the next trial.
The size of the disk presented during the feedback period was based on the estimated rating
from the CC activation pattern, which was computed during the fixation period, as follows.
First, measured functional images underwent 3-D motion correction using the Turbo Brain-
Voyager software. Second, a time-course of BOLD signal intensities was extracted from each of
the voxels in the CC identified in the fMRI decoder construction stage and was shifted by 4 s to
account for the hemodynamic delay. Third, a linear trend was removed from the time-course
for each voxel using a linear regression algorithm based on all time points except for those for
the initial 10 s in each fMRI run, and the BOLD signal time-course was z-score normalized for
each voxel using BOLD signal intensities measured for 20 s starting from 10 s after the onset of
each fMRI run. Fourth, the data sample used to calculate the size of the disk was created by
averaging the BOLD signal intensities of each voxel for three volumes corresponding to the 6 s
induction period. Finally, the estimated rating was calculated from the data sample using the

 decoder constructed in the fMRI decoder construction stage. For the higher-preference group,
the size of the disk was proportional to the estimated rating (ranging from one to ten). For the
lower-preference group, the size of the disk was proportional to 11 minus the estimated rating
so that a lower estimated rating resulted in a larger disk. In addition to the fixed amount of the
compensation for participation in the experiment, a bonus of up to 3,000 JPY was paid to sub-
jects based on the mean size of the disk during each day.
Induced CC-activation shifts shown in Fig 4 and S4A Fig indicate how far the activation
patterns of the CC during the induction stage are from the activation patterns in the CC corre-
sponding to the average behavioral preference rating. The induced CC-activation shift was cal-
culated as follows. First, the estimated rating Rdecoded from an activation pattern of the CC for a
trial was computed by the same method as in the pilot experiment, but only from the CC. That
is, Rdecoded was computed by
Rdecoded ¼ WT
voxel � Avoxel þ b:
Here, Avoxel represents the activation pattern of voxels in the CC in the induction period. Wvoxel
indicates linear weights for the voxels, which had been computed for each subject in the fMRI
decoder construction stage. b corresponds to the decoder’s constant term and had been deter-
mined for each subject as her/his average behavioral preference rating in the preference-rating
task during the fMRI decoder construction stage. This constant term varied across subjects.
Avoxel and Wvoxel are denoted as n-dimensional column vectors with n as the number of voxels
in the CC. T denotes matrix transpose.
The induced CC-activation shift for a trial was defined by
Rdecoded � b ¼ WT
voxel � Avoxel:
Based on the following computation, the induced CC-activation shift represents how far the
activation patterns in the CC during the induction stage are away from the activation pattern
in the CC corresponding to the average behavioral preference rating initially for each subject.
As described above, the constant term b was determined for each subject as her/his average
behavioral preference rating in the preference-rating task during the fMRI decoder construc-
tion stage. The set of 240 faces (the 100 highest-rated faces, the 100 lowest-rated faces, and 40
neutrally rated faces) used in the fMRI decoder construction stage was selected for each subject
according to her/his behavioral preference ratings to the 400 faces presented in the pre-test
stage. That is, the constant term b represents the subject’s average behavioral preference rating
for the population of faces. Thus, the induced CC-activation shift, which is calculated by sub-
tracting the constant term b from the estimated rating Rdecoded, represents how far the activa-
tion pattern in the CC is from the activation patterns in the CC corresponding to the average
behavioral preference rating for each subject.
It is necessary to obtain the induced CC-activation shift in order to appropriately evaluate
and compare induced activation patterns in the CC across subjects and groups during the
induction stage. Note that an induced CC-activation shift being “0” indicates that the activation
pattern of the CC was biased in neither the high nor low preference direction. A positive (or
negative) value of the induced CC-activation shift indicates that the activation pattern of the
CC was biased toward a positive (or negative) preference direction, compared to the activation
pattern corresponding to the average behavioral preference rating for each subject. Thus, when
the mean-induced CC-activation shift is significantly higher (or lower) than 0, this means that
subjects accomplished significant learning to induce the preference-related activation patterns
in the CC that correspond to higher (or lower) preference rating.

 With the control group, during the induction stage, the induction faces were presented in
the same way as with the higher- and lower-preference groups. On the other hand, unlike with
the higher- and lower-preference groups, the experiment was conducted outside the MRI scan-
ner without fMRI measurements for the control groups. Subjects from the control group con-
ducted a fixation task (see below) instead of the task given to those from the higher- and lower-
preference groups during the induction stage.
In the fixation task for the control group in the “induction” stage, during the 6 s “induction”
period, the luminance of the central fixation point slightly decreased (from green to dark
green), returning to its original luminance 300 ms later. This luminance change occurred sev-
eral times in an unpredictable manner during the 6 s period. Subjects from the control group
were asked to count the number of luminance changes and report whether the number of the
changes was even or odd by pressing one of two buttons using the index or middle finger of
their right hand during the fixation period. The task difficulty was controlled by using an adap-
tive staircase method, so that the overall task difficulty was kept constant throughout the
induction stage; the degree of fixation luminance change was slightly increased in the trial fol-
lowing an incorrect answer, and slightly decreased after two consecutive correct answers. Oth-
erwise, luminance was kept around the same. The mean (± s.e.m.) task accuracy for the
fixation task was 67.4% ± 5% across subjects. The green “feedback” disk was presented during
the 2 s “feedback” period. The size of the disk was determined randomly for each trial. Subjects
were instructed to fixate on the center of the display during the feedback period.
Leak Analyses
We tested whether preference-related activation patterns in the CC leaked out of the CC to
other regions and induced similar activation patterns in these regions. We conducted the leak
analysis using an ROI-based method and a searchlight method.
Leak analysis using an ROI-based method.
We first anatomically divided the whole brain
into a total of 38 regions (the CC and 37 other regions; see S1 Table for the number of voxels in
each region). The 37 other regions were specified using an atlas on the BrainVoyager QX soft-
ware [36], as shown in Fig 6 and S1 Table.
Second, for each subject we used the sparse linear regression algorithm [25] to reconstruct
the estimated ratings in the CC based on activation patterns measured in each of the aforemen-
tioned 37 other brain regions during the induction stage, as well as based on those in the CC
itself as a control. A reconstructed value Rreconstructed for a trial in each region was obtained by

Here, Avoxel represents an activation pattern of voxels in a region for a trial. Wvoxel indicates lin-
ear weights for the voxel values, which were optimized for each subject by the sparse linear
regression algorithm, and b corresponds to the constant term, which was determined as the
average of the estimated ratings from the CC activation patterns during the induction stage for
the subject. We defined reconstruction performance for each of the 38 regions as a correlation
coefficient between the reconstructed values and the estimated ratings from the CC activation
patterns and evaluated by a leave-one-run-out cross-validation procedure (Fig 6). Statistical
comparisons were conducted on z-scores of the correlation coefficients after permutation (see
Permutation Test for details).
Leak analysis using a searchlight method.
We employed a searchlight method [27] by
moving a searchlight sphere (radius = 15 mm) across the whole gray matter (~35,000 voxels).
Using the searchlight method, we calculated whole-brain maps, which represent leaking of

 preference-related activation patterns within the CC to other regions both during the fMRI
decoder construction stage (Fig 7A) and induction stage (Fig 7B).
Here are details of these calculations of the two whole-brain leak maps. For the fMRI
decoder construction stage, the leak map was obtained as follows. We calculated reconstruction
performance of the estimated rating in the CC. This calculation was conducted based on activa-
tion patterns of voxels in a searchlight sphere measured during the fMRI decoder construction
stage. In each sphere, the reconstruction performance was evaluated by a “nested cross-valida-
tion”-like procedure, as described below. In the inner cross-validation loop, we calculated esti-
mated ratings based on activation in the entire CC as reconstruction targets. This calculation
was conducted using the sparse linear regression [25]. We trained an estimated preference
regressor using 220 data samples from 11 out of the 12 fMRI runs in the fMRI decoder con-
struction stage. Then, we calculated 20 reconstruction targets using 20 data samples from the
remaining fMRI run. Thus, there were 12 cross-validation sets in this inner cross-validation
loop. In the outer cross-validation loop, reconstructed values of the targets were calculated
based on activation patterns of voxels within the sphere using L1-regulalized least-square
regression. Specifically, we trained a regression model using 19 out of the 20 data samples for
reconstruction. Then, we calculated one reconstructed value using one remaining data sample.
Thus, there were 20 cross-validation sets in the outer cross-validation loop. This “nested cross-
validation”-like procedure allowed us to calculate 240 reconstructed values of the estimated rat-
ings from activation patterns in the CC for all 240 trials in the fMRI decoder construction
stage. We defined reconstruction performance as the correlation coefficient between the recon-
structed values and the estimated ratings from the CC activation patterns during the fMRI
decoder construction stage.
For the induction stage, the leak map was obtained as follows. First, we calculated estimated
ratings based on activation patterns in the entire CC using 240 data sampled from the fMRI
decoder construction stage. This calculation was conducted using the sparse linear regression
algorithm. Second, we trained a regression model to reconstruct the estimated ratings in the
entire CC based on activation patterns of voxels in each searchlight sphere during the decoder
construction stage. This regression model was trained using an L1-regulalized least-square
regression algorithm. Then, this regression model was applied to data sampled from all trials
during the induction stage. Note that the estimated ratings in the entire CC during the induc-
tion stage had been obtained in the experiment with fMRI DecNef. Thus, we defined the recon-
struction performance as the correlation coefficient between the estimated ratings in the entire
CC obtained during the induction stage and its reconstructed values calculated by the above-
mentioned regression model.
The above analyses using the searchlight method were conducted on the native coordinates
of subjects. The results were spatially smoothed by a Gaussian filter (FWHM = 4 mm) and pro-
jected to a Talairach space. For each voxel, a statistical test was conducted on z-scores of corre-
lation coefficients after permutation (see Permutation Test for details of calculation of the z-
scores).
As mentioned above, to shorten computation time, we used the L1-regulalized least-square
regression in the leak analysis using the searchlight method. The L1-regulalized least-square
regression was implemented by using the LASSO algorithm, which has two hyper-parameters:
α and λ. The hyper-parameter α was fixed to one for all subjects. The hyper-parameter λ deter-
mines the balance between the residual and L1 norm of weights for voxels in each sphere. λ was
determined for each subject by an independent analysis using the L1-regulalized least-square
regression. In this analysis, based on activation patterns during the fMRI decoder construction
stage across all searchlight spheres, λ was determined to maximize the mean decoding perfor-
mance of the subject’s behavioral preference ratings.

 Permutation Test
To appropriately evaluate the statistical significance of a correlation coefficient between two
vectors of values, we performed a permutation test in the following ways. (1) We permutated a
relationship between the two vectors 1,000 times and obtained a permutation distribution of
correlation coefficients between the two values. (2) We tested whether a correlation coefficient
between the two values obtained from the original relationship was ranked within top 5% in
the distribution. If so, the correlation coefficient was regarded as significant.
In the case of between-subject statistics, we calculated a z-score of the original correlation
coefficient by comparing the original correlation coefficient with the distribution obtained by
the permutation [28].
Apparatus
Visual stimuli were presented on an LCD display (1,024 × 768 resolution, 60 Hz refresh rate)
during the pre- and post-test stages and via an LCD projector (1024 × 768 resolution, 60 Hz
refresh rate) during fMRI measurements in a dim room. All visual stimuli were made using the
Matlab software and Psychtoolbox 3 [44] on Mac OS X.
MRI Measurements and Parameters
Subjects were scanned in a 3T MR scanner (Siemens MAGNETOM Verio) with a 12-channel
head matrix coil in the ATR Brain Activation Imaging Center. FMRI signals were measured
using a gradient echo-planar imaging sequence. In the fMRI experiments, 33 contiguous slices
(repetition time = 2 s, voxel size = 3 × 3 × 3.5 mm3, 0 mm slice gap, field of view = 192
mm × 192 mm, echo time = 26 ms, matrix size = 64 × 64, bandwidth = 2,367 Hz/pixel, phase
encoding direction: from anterior to posterior, slice order: interleaved) oriented parallel to the
AC-PC plane were acquired, covering the entire brain. For an automated parcellation method
[38], T1-weighted MR images (magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo or MP-RAGE;
256 slices, the number of partition = 208, voxel size = 1 × 1 × 1 mm3, 0 mm slice gap, repetition
time = 2,250 ms, inversion time = 900 ms, echo time = 3.06 ms, flip angle = 9 deg, field of
view = 256 mm, matrix size = 256 × 256, bandwidth = 230 Hz/pixel, phase encoding direction:
from anterior to posterior, partition (2nd phase) encoding direction: from right to left) were
also acquired during the fMRI decoder construction stage.

 the main experiment (n = 24). The pilot experiment (see Pilot Experiment in Materials and
Methods for details) was aimed to select a single region that would be used as a target for fMRI
DecNef in the main experiment. The selection was made based on comparison of performance
of preference decoders among regions of interests (ROIs) that were implicated in facial prefer-
ence [14–20]: the amygdala, basal ganglia, insular cortex, occipitotemporal cortex, orbit frontal
cortex (OFC), lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC), and cingulate cortex (CC) (see Pilot Experiment
in Materials and Methods for the definition of the ROIs). Decoder’s performance for each ROI
was defined as a correlation coefficient between subjects’ behavioral preference ratings and the
estimated rating by the decoder from activation patterns of the ROI (see Pilot Experiment in
Materials and Methods for details). In the main experiment (shown in B), we found that the
decoder successfully predicted the subjects’ behavioral preference ratings based on the fMRI
datasets measured in the fMRI decoder construction stage in the basal ganglia (one-sample
two-tailed t-test on z-scores of the correlation coefficients after permutation, t23 = 3.20,
p < 10−2; Bonferroni corrected; see Permutation Test in Materials and Methods for details of
calculation of the z-scores), insular cortex (t23 = 3.07, p < 10−2, Bonferroni corrected), occipito-
temporal cortex (t23 = 4.17, p < 10−3, Bonferroni corrected), OFC (t23 = 4.11, p < 10−3, Bonfer-
roni corrected), LPFC (t23 = 4.46, p < 10−3, Bonferroni corrected), and CC (t23 = 12.52,
p < 10−4, Bonferroni corrected), but not in the amygdala (t23 = 0.64, p = 0.53). The mean per-
formance in the CC was significantly higher than that in the other ROIs (paired two-tailed t-
test on z-scores of the correlation coefficients after permutation, t23 > 4.73, p < 10−4; Bonfer-
roni corrected; see Permutation test in Materials and Methods for details of calculation of the
z-scores). The results of the main experiment (shown in B) showed the same tendency as in the
pilot experiment (shown in A), indicating that activation patterns of the CC most accurately
reflected subjects’ behavioral preference ratings in the preference-rating task.

ence groups, we found a significant correlation between the CC-activation shifts and changes
in subjects’ behavioral preference rating (r = 0.62 for the higher-preference group, r = 0.50 for
the lower-preference group, permutation test, p < 0.05; see Permutation Test in Materials and
Methods for details of the permutation test).

S3 Fig. Spatial distributions of weights of the preference decoder in the CC. (A) The mean
spatial distribution of the positive weight values across subjects. (B) The mean spatial distribu-
tion of the negative weight values across subjects. We tested whether the activation patterns for
positive and negative facial preferences are spatially dissociable in the CC. We also tested
whether the spatial activation pattern is consistent across subjects. In particular, we compared
spatial structures of activation patterns associated with positive and negative facial preferences
in two ways. The first analysis was aimed to examine spatial distributions of weights of the
preference decoder in the CC. The preference decoder was constructed based on measured
activation patterns in the CC in the fMRI decoder construction stage, during which subjects
reported their preference rating to faces (see Materials and Methods for details). The preference
decoder was constructed to estimate the subjects’ preference ratings based on the activation
patterns in the CC. Thus, the CC voxels that have positive weight values contribute to positive

 facial preferences, whereas those that have negative weight values contribute to negative facial
preferences. Therefore, examination of the spatial distributions of the weight values in the CC
should tell us whether the activation patterns associated with positive and negative facial pref-
erences are distributed differently in the CC. Positive (shown in A) and negative (shown in B)
weight values uniformly distributed and their distributions were largely overlapped in the CC.
Second, we tested whether positive and negative weight patterns are consistent across subjects.
If these patterns are consistent across subjects, the mean weight value across subjects for a
given voxel should be significantly different from zero. In contrast, if these patterns are not
consistent across subjects, the mean weight value for a given voxel would be around zero. We
found that the mean weight value across subjects was not significantly different from zero in
any of voxels in the CC (one-sample two-tailed t-test, p > 0.05, Bonferroni corrected). These
results suggest that spatial activation patterns for positive and negative facial preferences are
spatially overlapped and that these activation patterns vary across subjects. These lines of evi-
dence are at odds with the possibility that activation patterns for positive and negative facial
preferences are distributed in different subsections in the CC.

in each day of the induction stage. (A) Induction period. (B) Fixation period. (C) Inter-trial
period. The mean (± s.e.m.) induced CC-activation shifts for the higher- (red) and lower-
(blue) preference groups. To test whether similar activation patterns were induced in the CC
during the fixation and inter-trial period to during the induction period, we calculated the
induced CC-activation shifts over the three-day induction stage using the preference decoder
and compared them among the induction, fixation, and inter-trial periods. If activation pat-
terns were similar among these periods, the same pattern of induced CC-activation shifts
should be observed for all three periods. A three-way mixed-model ANOVA with factors being
period (induction, fixation, versus inter-trial periods), induction day (Day 1, Day 2, versus Day
3), and group (higher- versus lower-preference groups) was applied to the induced CC-activa-
tion shifts. The main effects of period (F2,44 = 3.48, p = 0.04) and group (F1,22 = 5.51, p = 0.03)
were significant. Significant interactions were obtained between period and group (F2,44 =
15.09, p < 10−4) and between induction day and group (F2,44 = 3.48, p = 0.04). These results are
not in accord with the possibility that the same pattern of induced CC-activation shifts should
be observed for all three periods. As shown in (A), for the induction period, on Day 3, the
induced CC-activation shifts were significantly greater than zero for the higher-preference
group (one-sample two-tailed t-test, t11 = 5.15, p < 10−3; Bonferroni corrected) and signifi-
cantly smaller than zero for the lower-preference group (t11 = 4.09, p < 10−2; Bonferroni cor-
rected). These results demonstrate that by Day 3 subjects successfully learned to induce
activation patterns in the CC that correspond to higher (higher-preference group) or lower
(lower-preference group) preference ratings during the induction stage. During the fixation
period (shown in B), for neither group the induced CC-activation shifts were significantly dif-
ferent from zero on any day (one-sample two-tailed t-test, t11 < 1.43, p > 0.18). During the
inter-trial period (shown in C) for neither group, the induced CC-activation shifts were signifi-
cantly different from zero on any day (one-sample two-tailed t-test, t11 < 1.35, p > 0.20).
These results are not consistent with the possibility that the neurofeedback affected subjects’
general emotional state, which in turn influenced activation patterns throughout the overall
experimental session in the induction stage.

 the overall mean amplitude in the CC changed during the induction period, we conducted an
amplitude-based analysis using the general linear model on the BrainVoyager QX software.
The amplitude of each voxel in the CC was calculated based on the contrast between the induc-
tion and inter-trial periods, and the calculated amplitudes were averaged across the voxels. To
test if the overall amplitudes differ between the higher- and lower-preference groups, a two-
way mixed-model ANOVA with factors being group (higher- versus lower-preference groups)
and induction day (day 1, day 2, versus day 3) was applied to the overall amplitudes in the CC.
None of a main effect of group (F1,22 = 1.01, p = 0.33), a main effect of induction day (F2,44 =
1.23, p = 0.30), or an interaction between the two factors (F2,44 = 0.45, p = 0.64) was significant.
In addition, for neither group, the amplitudes were significantly different from zero on any day
(one-sample two-tailed t-test, t11 < 2.17, p > 0.05).
