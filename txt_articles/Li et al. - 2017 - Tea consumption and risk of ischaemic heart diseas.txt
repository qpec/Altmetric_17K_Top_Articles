ABSTRACT
Objective To prospectively examine the association
between tea consumption and the risk of ischaemic
heart disease (IHD).
Methods Prospective study using the China Kadoorie
Biobank; participants from 10 areas across China were
enrolled during 2004–2008 and followed up until 31
December 2013. After excluding participants with
cancer, heart disease and stroke at baseline, the present
study included 199 293 men and 288 082 women aged
30–79 years at baseline. Information on IHD incidence
was collected through disease registries and the new
national health insurance databases.
Results During a median follow-up of 7.2 years, we
documented 24 665 (7.19 cases/1000 person-years)
incident IHD cases and 3959 (1.13 cases/1000 person-
years) major coronary events (MCEs). Tea consumption
was associated with reduced risk of IHD and MCE. In
the whole cohort, compared with participants who never
consumed tea during the past 12 months, the
multivariable-adjusted HRs and 95% CIs for less than
daily and daily tea consumers were 0.97 (0.94 to 1.00)
and 0.92 (0.88 to 0.95) for IHD, 0.92 (0.85 to 1.00)
and 0.90 (0.82 to 0.99) for MCE. No linear trends in
the HRs across the amount of tea were observed in daily
consumers for IHD and MCE (PLinear >0.05). The inverse
association between tea consumption and IHD was
stronger in rural (PInteraction 0.006 for IHD, <0.001 for
MCE), non-obese (PInteraction 0.012 for MCE) and non-
diabetes participants (PInteraction 0.004 for IHD).
Conclusions In this large prospective study, daily tea
consumption was associated with a reduced risk of IHD.
INTRODUCTION
T
ea is one of the most widely consumed beverages
in the world, especially in China. Polyphenols, par-
ticularly flavonoids, which are of great abundance
in tea, have been experimentally demonstrated to
inhibit oxidation reactions caused by free radicals
and prevent or delay atherosclerosis.1 2 Flavonoids
have also been shown to have antithrombotic3 and
anti-inflammatory properties,4
and may reverse
endothelial dysfunction.5 Experimental evidence
may collectively support a protective effect of tea
consumption on ischaemic heart disease (IHD).
Several previous prospective studies have related
tea consumption with reduced risk of IHD,6–10 but
several have not.11–16 These studies mostly had
small sample sizes and were too low-powered to
obtain precise effect estimates.
W
e therefore used data from the China Kadoorie
Biobank (CKB) study,17 18 an ongoing cohort of
0.5 million adults, to prospectively examine the
association of regular consumption of tea with the
risk of IHD.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
Study population
Details of the CKB study design and characteristics
of the study participants have been described else-
where.17 18 In brief, 512 891 participants aged 30–
79 years were recruited between 2004 and 2008
from five urban and five rural regions of China.
A total of 10 964 men and 14 549 women was
excluded from the present study because of a history
of cancer (n=2577), heart disease (n=15 472) or
stroke (n=8884) at baseline. Additionally, three par-
ticipants who were recorded with an implausible
censoring date for loss to follow-up were excluded.
The final analyses included 199 293 men and
288 082 women.
Assessment of tea consumption
In the baseline questionnaire, all CKB participants
were asked to report their frequency of tea con-
sumption during the past 12 months. Five frequency
categories were provided (never, only occasionally,
only at certain seasons, monthly but less than
weekly and at least once a week). Participants who
consumed at least once a week were further asked
about days consuming in a typical week (1–2 days/
week, 3–5 days/week or almost every day), amount
of tea (in 300 mL-sized cup) consumed in one con-
suming day, tea leaves (in gram) added each time,
times of changing tea leaves in one consuming day,
type of tea consumed most commonly (green tea,
oolong tea, black tea or others) and age when they
started tea consumption in most weeks. Participants
were provided a pictorial guide to gauge the amount
of tea in cup and tea leaves. The tea leaves added in
one consuming day was calculated by multiplying
amount added each time by times of changing tea
leaves. T
o test the reproducibility of tea consump-
tion frequency, 15 728 participants who completed
the same question on frequency of tea consumption
twice at a mean interval of 17 days were analysed.
The weighted kappa coefficient for tea consumption
was 0.77.
For the present analyses, all participants were
grouped into three categories regarding their con-
sumption frequency: never, less than daily and
daily. Daily tea consumers were further categorised,
according to rounded quartiles, as adding tea leaves
0.1–2.0, 2.1–3.0, 3.1–5.0 and >5.0 g/day; or con-
suming 1–2, 3–4, 5–6 and ≥7 cups of tea/day.

 Assessment of covariates
Covariate information was obtained from baseline question-
naire, including sociodemographic characteristics (age, sex, edu-
cation, occupation, household income and marital status),
lifestyle behaviours (alcohol consumption, tobacco smoking,
physical activity and intakes of red meat, fresh fruits and vegeta-
bles), personal medical history (hypertension, diabetes, chronic
hepatitis or cirrhosis, peptic ulcer and gallstones or cholecyst-
itis), women’s menopausal status and family history of heart
attack. The daily level of physical activity was calculated by
multiplying the metabolic equivalent tasks (METs) value for a
particular type of physical activity by hours spent on that activ-
ity per day and summing the MET-hours for all activities.
Habitual dietary intake in the past year was assessed by a quali-
tative food frequency questionnaire. Prevalent hypertension was
defined as measured systolic blood pressure ≥140 mm Hg, mea-
sured diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mm Hg, self-reported diag-
nosis of hypertension or self-reported use of antihypertensive
medication at baseline. Prevalent diabetes was defined as mea-
sured fasting blood glucose ≥7.0 mmol/L, measured random
blood glucose ≥11.1 mmol/L or self-reported diagnosis of dia-
betes. Trained staff undertook baseline measurements of body-
weight, height, waist circumference and blood pressure.
Assessment of outcome
The vital status of all CKB participants was obtained through
linkage with local disease surveillance points system death regis-
tries19 and residential records. Information on IHD incidence
was collected through linkage with established disease registries,
electronic linkage with the new national health insurance (HI)
claim databases.18 Participants who failed to be linked to local
HI database were actively followed annually by staff to ascertain
their status including hospital admission, death and moving out
of the study area.
Trained staff blinded to baseline information coded all diag-
noses and deaths using the International Classification of
Diseases, T
enth Revision. The primary outcomes were (1) inci-
dent major coronary events (MCEs) including fatal IHD (I20–
I25) and non-fatal myocardial infarction (I21–I23); and (2) a
broader IHD outcome including incident fatal and non-fatal
IHD (I20–I25), of which 80% coded as chronic IHD (I25). The
outcome adjudication process of incident IHD cases has been
started since 2014. The medical records of cases were retrieved,
and the diagnosis was adjudicated centrally by qualified cardio-
vascular specialists blinded to study assay. By August 2015, of
12 923 incident IHD cases reported since baseline and whose
medical records have been retrieved, the diagnosis was con-
firmed in 82.4% cases.
Statistical analysis
Person-years at risk were calculated for each participant from
baseline (2004–2008) to the diagnosis of the outcome, death,
loss to follow-up or 31 December 2013, whichever occurred
first. By 31 December 2013, 2411 (0.5%) participants were lost
to follow-up. Cox proportional hazards model was used to esti-
mate the HR and 95% CI for the associations between tea con-
sumption and outcomes with age as the underlying time scale,
and stratified jointly by survey region and age at baseline in
5-year interval. The proportional hazards assumption for the
Cox model was checked using Schoenfeld residuals and no vio-
lation was found.
Multivariate models were adjusted for established and poten-
tial risk factors for IHD: age, sex, level of education, marital
status, alcohol consumption, smoking status, physical activity,
body mass index (BMI), intake frequencies of red meat, fresh
fruits and vegetables, prevalent hypertension and diabetes at
baseline, menopausal status (for women only) and family
history of heart attack. T
ests for linear trend were only con-
ducted in daily consumers by modelling the amount of tea con-
sumption (in g/day or cup/day) as a continuous variable in
separate models.
W
e examined the associations between tea consumption and
outcomes according to the types of tea and years of tea con-
sumption, all as compared with those who did not consume tea
during the past 12 months. W
e also examined whether the asso-
ciations of tea consumption with outcomes differed according
to age, region, smoking status, alcohol consumption, the level of
physical activity, BMI, hypertension at baseline and diabetes at
baseline. In the subgroup analyses aforementioned, we com-
bined four categories of daily tea consumption into one to
ensure sufficient statistical power under the circumstance that
no linear trend was observed across the amount of tea leaves
added in the present analyses. The test for interaction was per-
formed using likelihood ratio test, which involved comparing
models with and without cross-product term between the base-
line stratifying variable and tea consumption as an ordinal
variable.
The statistical analyses were performed with Stata (V
.13.1,
Stata). All p values were two-sided, and statistical significance
was defined as p<0.05.
RESULTS
Of 487 375 study participants, 128 280 (26.3%) reported con-
suming tea almost every day. Table 1 presents age-adjusted and
region-adjusted baseline characteristics of the study participants
according to tea consumption. Compared with participants who
never consumed tea during the past 12 months, daily tea consu-
mers who usually used more tea leaves were more likely to be
younger, and urban residents, and more likely to smoke tobacco
and drink alcohol. Green tea was the most common type of tea
consumed in daily tea consumers.
During a median follow-up of 7.2 years, we documented
24 665 (7.19 cases/1000 person-years) incident IHD cases and
3959 (1.13 cases/1000 person-years) MCEs (including 2601
fatal IHD and 1358 non-fatal myocardial infarction). In the
whole cohort, compared with participants who never consumed
tea during the past 12 months, the multivariable-adjusted HRs
(95% CIs) for IHD were 0.97 (0.94 to 1.00) for those who con-
sumed tea less than daily, and 0.92 (0.87 to 0.97), 0.91 (0.85 to
0.98), 0.92 (0.87 to 0.98) and 0.91 (0.86 to 0.97) for those
who consumed 0.1–2.0, 2.1–3.0, 3.1–5.0 and >5.0 g of tea
leaves per day, respectively (table 2). The corresponding HRs
(95% CIs) for MCE were 0.92 (0.85 to 1.00), 0.83 (0.74 to
0.95), 0.99 (0.85 to 1.15), 0.87 (0.75 to 1.00) and 0.97 (0.84
to 1.11). The HRs across four groups in daily consumers were
statistically similar (p values for linear trend: 0.465 for IHD
and 0.218 for MCE). After merging categories, the HRs (95%
CIs) for daily consumers were 0.92 (0.88 to 0.95) for IHD and
0.90 (0.82 to 0.99) for MCE compared with participants who
never consumed tea during the past 12 months. T
ea consump-
tion was consistently associated with reduced risks of IHD and
MCE among both men and women (p values for interaction
with sex: 0.158 for IHD and 0.659 for MCE). Sex-specific asso-
ciations between tea consumption and both outcomes are pre-
sented in online supplementary table S1.
W
e also examined the associations of tea consumption mea-
sured in cups per day with the risk of IHD and MCE. The

 results were approximately similar (see online supplementary
table S2). The associations of tea consumption with IHD and
MCE did not change appreciably with additional adjustment for
occupation and household income; or additional adjustment for
histories of chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis, peptic ulcer and gall-
stone or cholecystitis; or adjustment for waist circumference
instead of BMI; or exclusion of participants whose outcomes
occurred during the first two years of follow-up; or exclusion
of participants with prevalent diabetes at baseline; or exclusion
of

consumers
from

group
(see
online
supplementary table S4).
W
e further performed subgroup analyses according to types
of tea consumed most commonly and years of tea consumption
in participants who consumed tea at least once a week. Similar
associations of tea consumption with IHD and MCE were
observed for both green tea consumers and non-green tea con-
sumers. The inverse associations of daily tea consumption with
both outcomes appeared to be stronger among participants who
reported longer years of tea consumption (table 3).
W
e also analysed the associations of tea consumption with
IHD and MCE according to potential baseline risk factors. The
associations were similar across subgroups stratified according
to age, smoking status, alcohol consumption, physical activity
and prevalent hypertension (all p values for interaction >0.05).
Significant differences in association with IHD and MCE across
strata were observed for the region (p values for interaction:
0.006 for IHD and <0.001 for MCE), with stronger inverse
associations among participants who resided in rural regions.
Stronger
inverse
associations
were
also
observed
among
participants with BMI <24 kg/m2 for MCE (p value for inter-
action: 0.012) and those without diabetes at baseline for IHD
(p
value
for
interaction:
0.004)
(figure

and
online
supplementary table S3).
DISCUSSION
In this large prospective Chinese cohort, tea consumption was
associated with a reduced risk of IHD. Compared with partici-
pants who never consumed tea during the past 12 months,
those who consumed tea daily showed an 8% relative risk
reduction in IHD and a 10% lower risk of MCE. The protective
effect of tea consumption on IHD was stronger among partici-
pants who drank tea for more than three decades, who resided
in a rural region, who had normal or lower BMI or who did
not have diabetes at baseline.
Previous prospective studies have provided inconsistent results
on the relationship between tea consumption and IHD.6–16 T
wo
studies7 8 conducted in the Dutch population have shown that
statistically significant protective effect of tea consumption,
mainly black tea, on coronary heart disease (CHD) incidence
were only observed for participants who drank tea >6 cups/day
(HR 0.64, 95% CI0.46 to 0.90)7 or for those who drank
>375 mL/day (0.57, 0.33 to 0.98).8 The Netherlands Cohort
Study also observed an inverse association between an increment
of 253 mL/day tea consumption and IHD mortality in men (HR
0.91, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.00).10 Findings from a Japanese popula-
tion9 showed that the multivariable-adjusted HR (95% CI) for
women drinking 1–6 cups/week, 1–2 cups/day, 3–5 cups/day and
>6 cups/day were 0.34 (0.06 to 1.75), 0.28 (0.07 to 1.11), 0.39

All variables were adjusted for age and survey regions, as appropriate. All exposures were associated with tea consumption, with p<0.001 for trend across categories, except for
diabetes (men: p=0.004; women: p=0.003), and green tea consumer in women (p=0.309). Tests for linear trend were only conducted in daily consumers by modelling the amount of
tea consumption (in g/day) as a variable in regression models.
*Body mass index was defined as the bodyweight divided by the square of the height.
†Average weekly consumptions of red meat, fresh vegetables and fruits were calculated by assigning participants to the midpoint of their consumption category.

Figure 1
Subgroup analysis of associations between daily tea consumption and risk of ischaemic heart disease (IHD) according to potential
baseline risk factors. HRs for IHD or major coronary events (MCEs) are for comparison of daily tea consumer with participants who never consumed
tea during the past 12 months. Risk estimates for other categories of tea consumption are shown in online supplementary table S3. Solid dots
represent point estimates, and horizontal lines represent 95% CIs. An HR of <1 means daily tea consumption was associated with a reduction in the
risk of the outcome of interest. The tests for interaction were performed using likelihood ratio tests, which involved comparing models with and
without cross-product terms between the baseline stratifying variable and tea consumption as an ordinal variable. BMI, body mass index; MET,

non-drinkers

green
tea.
The
inverse
association was not observed among men. Another prospective
study of Chinese6 reported that green tea consumption was
associated with lower risk of CHD incidence (0.89, 0.81 to
0.98) compared with non-green tea consumers. No statistically
significant association was found between tea consumption
and
IHD
in
other
prospective
studies
conducted
in
the
Japanese11
16 and W
estern population.12–15 In the present
study, we observed that daily tea consumers were at a lower risk
of IHD incidence than those who drank less than daily.
However, the increasing amount of tea did not further reduce
the risk of IHD, suggesting a possible threshold effect. Possible
mechanisms might involve the bioaccessibility and bioavailability
of polyphenols of tea,20 which needed to be verified by
further studies.
Different types of tea differ in active ingredients, such as
flavonoids, due to the difference in the degree of fermentation
during the manufacturing process,20 suggesting potentially dif-
ferent cardiovascular protective effects. However, we found
similar effects of green tea and non-green tea on reduced risk
of IHD. Fewer participants in our population consumed other
tea than green tea, which precluded further comparison of
effects of black tea, oolong tea or other types of tea on IHD.
Previous studies, either in the population mainly drinking
black tea7–8 10 or in the population mainly drinking green
tea,6 9 have observed the protective effect of tea consumption
on IHD.
In the subgroup analysis by years of tea consumption, we
found that the protective effect of tea consumption on the risk
of IHD appeared to be stronger in participants who reported a
longer history of consumption. Sesso et al12 have also indicated
that long-term tea consumption may be necessary to confer
health benefits. It has been suggested that there is no long-term
storage of polyphenols in the body.21 Frequent exposure to
physiological concentration of active ingredients over a long
period of time may be necessary for beneficial effect.
Previous studies6–8 10 16 found that the association between
tea consumption and the risk of IHD was consistent across sub-
groups defined by age, smoking status, BMI and the prevalence
of hypertension and diabetes. However, in the present analyses,
the protective effect of tea consumption on IHD was only
observed in non-obese or non-diabetic participants. Polyphenols
from tea, especially flavonoids, are the predominant contributor
to the protective health effect.22 The mutual relationship
between polyphenols and gut microbiota has received increasing
attention in recent years.23 The gut microbiota transform poly-
phenols into their potentially more bioactive metabolites. The
abundance and composition of gut microbiota have also been
recently related to the obesity,24 diabetes25 and cardiovascular
disease.26 Whether the altered gut microbiota among patients
who are obese or diabetic may influence the assimilation and
metabolism of polyphenols has yet to be further investigated. In
addition, we observed that the protective effect of tea consump-
tion on IHD was more pronounced in rural participants. It is
possible that the flavonoids are easily available from other
various food sources such as vegetables and fruits27 in the urban
diet, and tea consumption added only modestly beneficial effect
on IHD.
To our knowledge, this is by far the largest prospective study
assessing the association between tea consumption and incident
IHD. W
e have carefully controlled for established and potential
risk factors for IHD. W
e measured tea consumption in gram of
tea leaves added, which may be a better measure of tea
consumption and at least partly reflect the intake amount of
active ingredient.
A few limitations need to be considered. T
ea consumption
was self-reported, raising the possibility of misclassification. The
questions on tea consumption have not yet validated directly.
However, measurement errors in the prospective study design
may be non-differential, and the association is more likely to be
attenuated towards the null. T
ea consumption may be correlated
with other dietary habits and lifestyle behaviours. Residual con-
founding by other unmeasured or unknown factors was still pos-
sible. For example, coffee consumption may be a confounder
but was not collected in this population at baseline. However,
coffee is rarely consumed in the present population. Therefore,
it is less likely that coffee consumption confounds the observed
association substantially. Further, information was not available
on tea brewing methods, which may influence the release of
active ingredients of tea.28 Lack of detailed dietary information
in this study limited our ability to examine whether population-
specific dietary patterns modify the association between tea
consumption and IHD and generalise the results to other popu-
lation. Reverse causality could happen. Participants with diag-
nosed or subclinical chronic diseases may change consumption
habits. However, we excluded participants with major diseases
in our analyses. Moreover, the results did not change appre-
ciably when we additionally adjusted for digestive system
Key messages
What is already known on this subject?
▸ Previous prospective cohort studies observed inconsistent
results on the role of tea in the prevention of ischaemic
heart disease (IHD). In addition, evidence from the
Netherlands and Japan suggested that the association might
be dose–response relationship in daily tea consumers.
However, these studies mostly had small sample sizes and
were too low-powered to obtain precise effect estimates,
leaving the relation between the tea consumption and IHD
still less well established.
What might this study add?
▸ Daily tea consumption was associated with a reduced risk of
IHD in Chinese tea consumers. Intriguingly, daily tea
consumers were at a lower risk of IHD incidence than those
who drank less than daily, but the increasing amount of tea
did not further reduce the risk.
▸ The protective effect of tea consumption on IHD appeared to
be stronger among participants who reported longer years of
tea consumption, resided in rural regions, participants with
body mass index <24 kg/m2, and those without diabetes at
baseline.
▸ In addition to measuring tea consumption by cups, which
conducted by previous studies, we measured tea
consumption in gram of tea leaves added, which may be a
better measure of tea consumption and at least partly reflect
the intake amount of active ingredient.
How might this impact on clinical practice?
▸ The present study yields compelling evidence on
understanding the role of tea in cardiovascular health and
referring tea as a healthy beverage.

 disorders or excluded participants who had IHD event during
the first two years of follow-up.
In conclusion, data from this largest prospective cohort of
Chinese adults showed that daily tea consumption was asso-
ciated with a decreased risk of IHD incidence. Given the obser-
vational nature, this study alone could not establish a causal
relationship. Further randomised studies may be needed to
confirm the protective effect of tea consumption on IHD.
