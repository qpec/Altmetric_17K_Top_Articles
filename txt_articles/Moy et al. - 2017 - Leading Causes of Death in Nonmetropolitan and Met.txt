Abstract
Problem/Condition: Higher rates of death in nonmetropolitan areas (often referred to as rural areas) compared with metropolitan 
areas have been described but not systematically assessed.
Period Covered: 1999–2014
Description of System: Mortality data for U.S. residents from the National Vital Statistics System were used to calculate age-
adjusted death rates and potentially excess deaths for nonmetropolitan and metropolitan areas for the five leading causes of death. 
Age-adjusted death rates included all ages and were adjusted to the 2000 U.S. standard population by the direct method. Potentially 
excess deaths are defined as deaths among persons aged <80 years that exceed the numbers that would be expected if the death rates 
of states with the lowest rates (i.e., benchmark states) occurred across all states. (Benchmark states were the three states with the lowest 
rates for each cause during 2008–2010.) Potentially excess deaths were calculated separately for nonmetropolitan and metropolitan 
areas. Data are presented for the United States and the 10 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services public health regions.
Results: Across the United States, nonmetropolitan areas experienced higher age-adjusted death rates than metropolitan areas. The 
percentages of potentially excess deaths among persons aged <80 years from the five leading causes were higher in nonmetropolitan 
areas than in metropolitan areas. For example, approximately half of deaths from unintentional injury and chronic lower respiratory 
disease in nonmetropolitan areas were potentially excess deaths, compared with 39.2% and 30.9%, respectively, in metropolitan 
areas. Potentially excess deaths also differed among and within public health regions; within regions, nonmetropolitan areas tended 
to have higher percentages of potentially excess deaths than metropolitan areas.
Interpretation: Compared with metropolitan areas, nonmetropolitan areas have higher age-adjusted death rates and greater 
percentages of potentially excess deaths from the five leading causes of death, nationally and across public health regions.
Public Health Action: Routine tracking of potentially excess deaths in nonmetropolitan areas might help public health departments 
identify emerging health problems, monitor known problems, and focus interventions to reduce preventable deaths in these areas.

Introduction
In 2014, approximately 15% of the U.S. population (46 
million persons) lived in nonmetropolitan counties (1). 
Nonmetropolitan and metropolitan communities differ in 
their demographic, environmental, economic, and social 
characteristics, which influence the magnitude and types 
of health problems they have. Nonmetropolitan areas have 
higher rates of cigarette smoking, hypertension, obesity, and 
physical inactivity during leisure time (2–4). More residents 
of nonmetropolitan areas lived in poverty compared with 
residents of metropolitan areas in 2014 (18.1% and 15.1%, 
respectively) (1). Availability of resources for preventive services

and access to health care also differ among certain localities. 
Residents of nonmetropolitan areas are more likely to report 
less access to health care and lower quality of health care (5). 
Metropolitan areas generally have a greater density and diversity 
of health care providers than nonmetropolitan areas (2,3).
Both in nonmetropolitan and metropolitan areas, the five 
leading causes of death in the United States during 1999–2014 
were heart disease, cancer, unintentional injury, chronic lower 
respiratory disease, and stroke (6) which together accounted for 
1,622,304 deaths (approximately 62% of all deaths) in 2014 (6). 
Four of the five leading causes of death were chronic diseases, two 
of which (heart disease and cancer) accounted for approximately 
46% of all deaths each year (6). Potentially excess deaths (also 
described as potentially preventable deaths) (7,8) are defined as 
deaths among persons aged <80 years in excess of the number that 
would be expected if the death rates for each cause were equivalent 
across all states to those that occurred among the three states with 
the lowest rates. Not all potentially excess deaths can be prevented; 
some areas might have characteristics that predispose residents to 
higher rates of death, such as long travel distances to specialty and 
emergency care or exposures to specific environmental hazards. 
However, many potentially excess deaths might represent deaths 
that could be prevented through improved public health programs 
that support healthier behaviors and neighborhoods or better 
access to health care services.
To examine differences for the five leading causes of death in 
nonmetropolitan and metropolitan areas in the United States, 
CDC analyzed mortality data from the National Vital Statistics 
System. This report presents trends in age-adjusted death rates 
among persons of all ages during 1999–2014 and the number 
of potentially excess deaths among persons aged <80 years 
during 2010–2014. These findings can be used by public 
health officials and practitioners to identify nonmetropolitan 
areas with the highest rates of potentially excess deaths and to 
focus on specific regions that would benefit from programs to 
reduce mortality from the five leading causes of death.
Methods
Nonmetropolitan and metropolitan areas were identified 
using the Office of Management and Budget’s 2013 county-
based classification scheme (9). Although the terms rural and 
nonmetropolitan often are used interchangeably, as are the 
terms urban and metropolitan, other definitions of rural exist 
(10). To avoid confusion, the terms nonmetropolitan and 
metropolitan are used in this report. The term locality is used 
to refer both to nonmetropolitan and metropolitan areas.
Mortality data for U.S. residents from the National Vital 
Statistics System were analyzed. Deaths were categorized as 
nonmetropolitan or metropolitan on the basis of the county 
of residence of the decedent. Analyses were restricted to deaths 
with an underlying cause of death among the five leading 
causes based on the International Classification of Diseases, 
10th Revision (ICD-10): heart disease (I00-I09, I11, I13, and 
I20–I51), cancer (C00–C97), unintentional injury (V01–X59 
and Y85–Y86), chronic lower respiratory disease (J40–J47), 
and stroke (I60–I69). The analysis of trends in age-adjusted 
death rates during 1999–2014 included all ages; death rates 
were adjusted to the 2000 U.S. standard population by the 
direct method. The analysis of potentially excess deaths 
during 2010–2014 was restricted to persons aged <80 years 
at the time of death; the age restriction is consistent with the 
average life expectancy for the total U.S. population, which 
was approximately 79 years in 2010 (7).
Potentially excess deaths were defined as deaths among 
persons aged <80 years in excess of the number that would 
be expected if the age-specific death rates of the three states 
with the lowest rates (i.e., benchmark states) occurred across 
all states. Numbers of potentially excess deaths for each of the 
five leading causes of death were calculated using procedures 
previously published by CDC (7). For each age group and 
cause, the death rates of the three states with the lowest 
rates during 2008–2010 (benchmark states) were averaged 
to produce benchmark rates (https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/
cdc/42342). Because the goal of this analysis was to calculate 
total numbers of potentially excess deaths in nonmetropolitan 
and metropolitan areas, the same benchmarks were applied both 
to nonmetropolitan and metropolitan areas, and benchmarks 
were not adjusted for other characteristics that might affect 
death rates (e.g., race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status). 
Estimates of expected deaths for each specific age group, cause 
of death, and locality were calculated by multiplying age-cause-
state-locality population estimates by the benchmark rates, 
and the expected deaths were subtracted from observed deaths 
to yield potentially excess deaths. Age-cause-state-locality 
potentially excess deaths were summed over age groups to 
produce cause-state estimates and over states to produce cause-
specific estimates for the 10 U.S. Department of Health and 
Human Services (HHS) public health regions (Figure 1) and 
the United States. Estimates of potentially excess deaths that 
were negative, typically from one or two of the benchmark 
states, were set to zero. For each cause of death, the percentage 
of deaths that was potentially excess was calculated by dividing 
the cause-locality–specific estimate of potentially excess deaths 
by the observed number of deaths for that cause and locality.
The numbers of potentially excess deaths for each cause 
were assumed to follow a Poisson distribution, and standard 
errors for both the number and percentage of excess deaths 
were calculated using standard formulas that incorporated the

variance both around the observed and the expected counts 
(11). National trends for nonmetropolitan and metropolitan 
areas and differences in trends between nonmetropolitan and 
metropolitan areas in cause-specific age-adjusted death rates 
during 1999–2014 and in numbers of potentially excess deaths 
during 2010–2014 were assessed using Joinpoint regression 
(12). Differences in the percentages of deaths that were 
potentially excess in nonmetropolitan and metropolitan areas 
were compared using z-tests. Trends and differences discussed 
in the results were considered statistically significant at p<0.05.
Results
Trends in Annual Age-Adjusted Death 
Rates, 1999–2014
During 1999–2014, annual age-adjusted death rates for 
heart disease, stroke, cancer, unintentional injury, and chronic 
lower respiratory disease were higher in nonmetropolitan 
areas than in metropolitan areas (Figure 2). Age-adjusted 
death rates for unintentional injury were approximately 
50% higher in nonmetropolitan areas than in metropolitan 
areas for most of this period. Both in nonmetropolitan and 
metropolitan areas, annual age-adjusted death rates for heart 
disease and stroke decreased; however, the rate of decrease for 
heart disease was slower in nonmetropolitan areas, whereas the 
rates of decrease for stroke were similar. During 1999–2014, 
annual age-adjusted death rates for chronic lower respiratory 
disease decreased in metropolitan areas and increased in 
nonmetropolitan areas. Although the annual age-adjusted 
death rates for cancer decreased in both localities during this 
period, the rate of decrease was slower in nonmetropolitan 
areas. The annual age-adjusted death rates for unintentional 
injury increased at similar rates in nonmetropolitan and 
metropolitan areas. 
Potentially Excess Deaths, 2010–2014
As the number of persons aged <80 years living in 
nonmetropolitan areas of the United States decreased from 
44.3 million in 2010 to 44.1 million in 2014 (an average 
of 0.1% per year), the numbers of potentially excess deaths 
in nonmetropolitan areas decreased for cancer an average 
of 2.7% per year, increased for chronic lower respiratory 
disease an average of 3.2% per year, and remained stable for 
heart disease, stroke, and unintentional injury (Figure 3). 
In 2014, the number of potentially excess deaths among 
those aged <80 years for the five leading causes of death in 
nonmetropolitan areas of the United States were 25,278 from 
heart disease, 19,055 from cancer, 12,165 from unintentional 
injury, 10,676 from chronic lower respiratory disease, and 
4,108 from stroke.
Compared with metropolitan areas, a higher percentage of 
deaths occurring in nonmetropolitan areas from the five leading 
causes among those aged <80 years were potentially excess 
deaths (Figure 4). For example, in 2014, 42.6% of heart disease 
deaths among persons aged <80 years in nonmetropolitan 
areas were potentially excess deaths, compared with 27.8% 
in metropolitan areas. Approximately half of deaths among 
persons aged <80 years from unintentional injury (57.5%) and 
chronic lower respiratory disease (54.3%) in nonmetropolitan 
areas were potentially excess deaths, compared with 39.2% and 
30.9%, respectively, in metropolitan areas.
The percentages of potentially excess deaths among persons 
aged <80 years from the five leading causes varied widely across 
HHS public health regions (Figure 5). In most public health 
regions, nonmetropolitan areas had a higher percentage of 
potentially excess deaths among persons aged <80 years than did 
metropolitan areas. For example, in 2014 in region 9 (Arizona, 
California, Hawaii, and Nevada), 65.0% of unintentional 
injury deaths in nonmetropolitan areas were potentially 
excess deaths, compared with 29.2% in metropolitan areas. 
Nonmetropolitan areas of region 4 (Alabama, Florida, Georgia, 
Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and 
Tennessee) and region 6 (Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, 
Oklahoma, and Texas) had the highest percentages of heart 
disease, cancer, chronic lower respiratory disease, and stroke

deaths that were potentially excess deaths. Metropolitan 
areas of region 1 (Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New

percentages of heart disease and stroke deaths that were 
potentially excess deaths, and metropolitan areas of region 
2 (New Jersey and New York) had the lowest percentages of

Discussion
During 1999–2014, nonmetropolitan areas had higher 
age-adjusted death rates from the five leading causes of death 
than metropolitan areas, consistent with previous reports (13). 
During this period, the age-adjusted death rates for heart 
disease, cancer, chronic lower respiratory disease, and stroke 
in metropolitan areas decreased. In nonmetropolitan areas, the 
rates for heart disease, cancer, and stroke decreased but increased

for chronic lower respiratory disease. Both in nonmetropolitan 
and metropolitan areas, the rates for unintentional injury 
increased. During this period, differences in age-adjusted 
death rates between nonmetropolitan and metropolitan areas 
either persisted or increased for the five leading causes of death. 
Consistent with previous studies, considerable numbers of deaths 
among persons aged <80 years from the five leading causes of 
death were identified as potentially excess deaths nationally (7,8). 
Data from this report indicate that the percentage of deaths 
among persons aged <80 years that are potentially excess deaths 
was higher in nonmetropolitan areas than in metropolitan areas, 
which is a new finding. Moreover, this difference was observed 
in most public health regions, even as percentages varied widely 
across the United States.
Previous research has shown that residents of nonmetropolitan 
areas, compared with residents of metropolitan areas, report 
poorer physical and mental health and have higher rates of 
health risk factors for the leading causes of death, including 
factors such as cigarette smoking, obesity, physical inactivity 
during leisure time, and not wearing car seat belts (2,3,14). 
They tend to have less access to health care services and to be 
less likely to receive preventive services (5). In addition, they 
are more likely to be uninsured or underinsured, delay seeking 
care, live in poverty, and have lower educational attainment 
(1,5). The high percentage of potentially excess deaths reported 
in nonmetropolitan areas might be related to the poorer health, 
limited socioeconomic resources, restricted access to high-quality 
emergency and specialty care such as trauma centers and stroke 
centers, and reduced emergency medical service capability (15) 
that exist in many nonmetropolitan communities. Although a 
greater number of potentially excess deaths occur in metropolitan 
areas because of the larger populations, these findings suggest 
that a greater percentage of deaths in nonmetropolitan areas 
might be potentially excess deaths and thus are relevant for 
public health prevention efforts focused on rural populations. 
Ongoing work by CDC to reduce rates of smoking (16) and 
obesity (17) are particularly important because these risk factors 
contribute to increased risk for heart disease, stroke, chronic 
lower respiratory disease, and cancer (18,19). In addition, CDC’s 
efforts to increase access to preventive services, such as cancer 
screening (20) and cardiovascular risk reduction (21), address 
barriers that persons living in nonmetropolitan areas might face.
Limitations
The findings in this report are subject to at least five 
limitations. First, age-adjusted rates are index measures that do 
not represent actual deaths but are appropriate for comparisons 
across populations with different age distributions. Second, 
standard errors of estimates of potentially excess deaths 
were calculated using standard formulas that incorporate 
the variance around both the observed and the expected 
counts. Less conservative methods for calculating standard 
errors might identify additional differences in potentially 
excess deaths between nonmetropolitan and metropolitan 
areas that do not achieve statistical significance using the 
more conservative approach reported here. Third, the same 
benchmarks based on the three states with the lowest death 
rates were applied to nonmetropolitan and metropolitan areas. 
Although nonmetropolitan areas might have characteristics 
that make deaths harder to prevent, such as long travel distances 
and fewer community resources to support health, numbers 
of potentially excess deaths both in nonmetropolitan and 
metropolitan areas can likely be reduced through public health 
and health care programs. Fourth, estimates of potentially 
excess deaths using historical benchmarks (e.g., 2008–2010) 
might not reflect the progress that could be made in a later 
year. For example, the estimates of potentially excess deaths for 
cancer based on 2010 benchmarks are lower than those based 
on 2014 benchmarks because of decreases in cancer deaths

during 2010–2014. Finally, the county-based metropolitan-
nonmetropolitan classification scheme does not account for 
variation in population density within counties. For example, 
large metropolitan counties might include areas that are 
defined as rural by the U.S. Census Bureau. In addition, 
assessing potentially excess deaths using the nonmetropolitan 
and metropolitan classifications masks important differences 
within urban and rural areas. For example, considerable 
variation occurs in settlement patterns and density among 
nonmetropolitan counties; some include small towns, and 
others are classified as frontier counties with no urban areas. 
Considerable variation in measures of health occurs among 
metropolitan counties; suburban metropolitan counties tend 
to have substantially better health outcomes than inner-city 
metropolitan counties (2,3).
Future Directions
This report demonstrates the value of disaggregating 
nonmetropolitan and metropolitan area deaths and potentially 
excess deaths. Trends in death rates and potentially excess deaths 
over a longer period might provide a better understanding of 
factors that contribute to differences. Examination of county-
level patterns within states (and other jurisdictions) might be 
used to help determine where to allocate resources and assistance 
in rural areas with larger numbers of potentially excess deaths. 
Comparison with tools such as the CDC Interactive Atlas of 
Heart Disease and Stroke (http://www.cdc.gov/dhdsp/maps/
atlas/index.htm) might help identify the social determinants, 
health care infrastructure, and public policies that attenuate 
or exacerbate mortality in specific nonmetropolitan areas. 
Detailed community-based case-control studies comparing 
areas with the highest and lowest death rates might clarify how 
various risk factors and community-wide social determinants 
of health affect mortality in rural and urban areas. In addition, 
consideration of other methods for developing benchmark 
rates might be helpful. Other methods include benchmarks 
based on the nonmetropolitan areas with the lowest death 
rates, alternative approaches for accounting for uncertainty 
around estimates of potentially excess deaths such as Monte 
Carlo procedures or bootstrapping, potentially excess deaths 
among persons aged >80 years, and potentially excess deaths 
from other causes, especially causes that are more prevalent 
in rural areas.
Conclusion
Nonmetropolitan areas have higher age-adjusted death 
rates and greater percentages of potentially excess deaths 
from the five leading causes of death. Routine tracking of 
potentially excess deaths from the five leading causes of death 
in nonmetropolitan and metropolitan areas might help public 
health officials monitor important rural health disparities and 
select effective programs and policies to improve the health of 
residents of rural areas. Additional information on potentially 
excess deaths might be used to evaluate the success of public 
health interventions and to help determine where to allocate 
resources in areas with the greatest need. State and local 
public health officials in rural areas might seek advice from 
officials in rural areas with fewer potentially excess deaths 
for ways to reduce mortality in their jurisdictions or increase 
coordination with urban areas to ensure rural residents have 
timely access to specialized services. More detailed data on age-
adjusted mortality and potentially excess deaths are available as 
supplemental materials (https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/43149 
and https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/43148).

aged <80 years for five leading causes of death in nonmetropolitan 
and metropolitan areas† — National Vital Statistics System, 
 
United States, 2014
* For each age group and cause, the death rates of the three states with the 
lowest rates during 2008−2010 (benchmark states) were averaged to produce 
benchmark rates. Potentially excess deaths were defined as deaths among 
persons aged <80 years in excess of the number that would be expected if 
the age group–specific death rates of the benchmark states occurred across 
all states.
