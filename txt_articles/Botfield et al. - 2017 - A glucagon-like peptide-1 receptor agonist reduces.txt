Current therapies for reducing raised intracranial pressure (ICP) under conditions such as idiopathic intracranial
hypertension or hydrocephalus have limited efficacy and tolerability. Thus, there is a pressing need to identify
alternative drugs. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists are used to treat diabetes and promote
weight loss but have also been shown to affect fluid homeostasis in the kidney. We investigated whether exendin-4,
a GLP-1R agonist, is able to modulate cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) secretion at the choroid plexus and subsequently
reduce ICP in rats. We used tissue sections and cell cultures to demonstrate expression of GLP-1R in the choroid
plexus and its activation by exendin-4, an effect blocked by the GLP-1R antagonist exendin 9-39. Acute treatment
with exendin-4 reduced Na+- and K+-dependent adenosine triphosphatase activity, a key regulator of CSF secretion,
in cell cultures. Finally, we demonstrated that administration of exendin-4 to female rats with raised ICP (hydroce-
phalic) resulted in a GLP-1R–mediated reduction in ICP. These findings suggest that GLP-1R agonists can reduce ICP
in rodents. Repurposing existing GLP-1R agonist drugs may be a useful therapeutic strategy for treating raised ICP.
INTRODUCTION
Elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) is caused by alterations in the vol-
ume of either cerebral blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), or brain tissue.
CSF volume is tightly regulated and depends on the balance between
CSFsecretion, whichismodulatedpredominantly bythechoroidplexus,
and drainage through the arachnoid granulations and lymphatics (1).
Reducing CSF volume, by either CSF drainage or decreasing CSF secre-
tion, is used therapeutically to lower ICP (2, 3) under conditions char-
acterized by raised ICP such as idiopathic intracranial hypertension and
hydrocephalus.
In the choroid plexus, CSF is secreted by the choroid plexus epithe-
lial (CPe) cells and is driven by net movement of sodium ions (Na+)
from the blood into the cerebral ventricles. This creates an osmotic gra-
dient, which drives water transport into the cerebral ventricles. There
are numerous ion channels involved in this process, but the apical Na+-
andK+-dependentadenosinetriphosphatase(Na+K+ATPase)thatpumps
Na+ into the ventricles is the most important of these channels and repre-
sents the rate-limiting step (4, 5). Specific inhibition of the Na+ K+ ATPase
with ouabain reduces CSF secretion by 70 to 80% (6). Hence, the CPe cells
functionakintoinvertedrenalproximaltubuleepithelialcellswithananal-
ogous mechanism of fluid transport (7, 8).
The incretin glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is a gut peptide se-
creted by the distal small intestine in response to food intake (9).
GLP-1 stimulates glucose-dependent insulin secretion and inhibits
glucagon release, lowering blood glucose (10). In addition, GLP-1 is
synthesized in neurons of the nucleus tractus solitarius, which project
to the hypothalamus (11) and promote satiety and weight loss (12–14).
GLP-1 signals through the GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R), a class B G pro-
tein (heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein)–coupled receptor expressed
in selected cell types within the central nervous system including the
hypothalamus, hippocampus, olfactory cortex, circumventricular
organs, hindbrain, and choroid plexus (15–17).
GLP-1 also has effects on renal proximal tubule Na+ secretion,
reducing Na+ reabsorption and increasing diuresis (18). Here,
GLP-1R activation stimulates the conversion of adenosine tri-
phosphate to cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) by adenylate
cyclase. cAMP activates protein kinase A (PKA), which inhibits the
Na+ H+ exchanger, thereby preventing Na+ reabsorption into the
bloodstream (18). The diuretic actions of incretins have led to investi-
gation of their use as antihypertensive agents (19). Similar to its activity
in the kidney, we hypothesize that GLP-1 also modulates Na+ transport
and, subsequently, fluid movement at the choroid plexus. We propose
that GLP-1R activation may inhibit the basal Na+ H+ exchanger
through cAMP-dependent PKA activation, thus impeding the Na+ K+
ATPase–dependent secretion of CSF. Stabilized GLP-1 mimetics are
widely used to treat diabetes and obesity and therefore could be repur-
posed for treating raised ICP.
Here, we used tissue sections and CPe cell cultures to assess the local-
ization and distribution of the GLP-1R in rat and human choroid plexus
and determined the effects of GLP-1R stimulation on CSF secretion.
Furthermore, we conducted in vivo studies to evaluate the effects of
GLP-1R agonists on ICP in a hydrocephalus rat model with raised ICP.
RESULTS
The GLP-1R is expressed in human choroid plexus tissue
Immunohistochemical analysis using hematoxylin and eosin staining
confirmed that human donor tissue comprised the choroid plexus, dem-
onstrating choroid plexus morphology including a cuboidal CPe cell
monolayer resting on a basement membrane, the underlying interstitial
tissue, and capillary vessels (Fig. 1A). GLP-1R mRNA expression in five
human choroid plexus samples was compared to known commercially
available GLP-1R–positive tissues (pooled samples; see Materials and
Methodsforsource details). Human pancreashad the highest expression

 of GLP-1R mRNA, with the heart and ovary having the least. Human
choroid plexus showed GLP-1R mRNA expression (Fig. 1B). To de-
termine the localization of the receptor protein, we immunostained
paraffin-embedded human choroid plexus sections with a specific
monoclonal antibody to human GLP-1R previously validated in human
and monkey tissue sections (20, 21). On the basis of the morphology of
the choroid plexus, GLP-1R–positive staining was detected in CPe cells
(Fig. 1, C to F). Together, these studies demonstrate that the human
choroid plexus expresses GLP-1R mRNA and protein.
Exendin-4 treatment modulates the GLP-1R in rat choroid
plexus in vitro
Given the lack of validated antibodies against rodent GLP-1R, we in-
stead incubated whole rat choroid plexus in vitro with a fluorescently
taggedGLP-1Ragonist,exendin-4(FLEX),
to demonstrate the presence of the recep-
tor in the choroid plexus. After 15 min of
1 mM FLEX incubation, only a few CPe
cells were positive for FLEX within the cy-
toplasm (Fig. 2A). However, this increased
by30min(Fig.2A).In bothcases,GLP-1R
appeared to localize predominantly in
the cytoplasm, consistent with agonist-
induced receptor internalization and
trafficking, most likely via endosomes
(22). The GLP-1R antagonist exendin
9-39 (1 mM) reduced the number of
FLEX-positive cells within the choroid
plexus (Fig. 2A), suggesting specific
binding of the FLEX ligand to GLP-1R.
Next, we determined Glp-1r mRNA
expression in whole rat choroid plexus
tissue after incubation with 100 nM
exendin-4. Incubation of the rat choroid
plexus with exendin-4 for 3 hours showed
an increase in Glp-1r mRNA compared to
artificial CSF (3.21 ± 0.70–fold; P < 0.01),
with a return to baseline at 6 hours (0.78 ±
0.12–fold) (Fig. 2B). There was also a
small but detectable increase in Na+ K+
atpase mRNA expression after 3 hours of
exendin-4 treatment compared to incuba-
tion with artificial CSF (1.82 ± 0.28–fold;
P < 0.05), which again returned to baseline
at 6 hours (0.97 ± 0.21–fold) (Fig. 2C). The
expression of other channels and trans-
porters involved in CSF secretion, includ-
ing the water channel aquaporin 1 (Aqp1)
and the Na+ H+ exchanger (Nhe1), was
not altered after exendin-4 treatment
(Fig. 2, D and E).
Exendin-4 treatment increases cAMP
and reduces Na+ K+ ATPase activity
To explore further the effects of exendin-4
on the choroid plexus, we grew mono-
layers of rat CPe cells in culture. These
CPe cells were characterized using anti-
bodies against specific identity markers
and were shown to be similar to their in vivo counterparts (fig. S1A),
including the expression of Glp-1r mRNA (fig. S1B). To determine the
effect of exendin-4 on GLP-1R signaling, we assessed cAMP generation
using two enzyme immunoassay systems. Treatment of CPe cells with
exendin-4 increased cAMP compared to control (2.14 ± 0.61–fold; P <
0.01) (Fig. 3A) in a concentration-dependent manner, and this could
be inhibited by exendin 9-39 (Fig. 3B). Forskolin, an adenylate cyclase
activator, was used as a positive control to maximally stimulate cAMP
production (5.30 ± 0.74–fold compared to control) (Fig. 3, A and B).
The role of GLP-1R signaling in CSF secretion was assessed in rat
CPe cell cultures by measuring Na+ K+ ATPase activity (proposed as a
marker of CSF secretion from the choroid plexus) (6). Exendin-4 treat-
ment reduced Na+ K+ATPase–specific phosphate production compared
to control (39.3 ± 9.4%; P < 0.05) (Fig. 3C). In addition, inhibition of

 PKA with PKI(16–22) amide [PKA inhibitor (PKI)] abolished the
exendin-4–induced reduction in Na+ K+ ATPase activity (95.4 ±
17.6%; P < 0.05) (Fig. 3C).
Exendin-4 treatment reduces ICP in conscious rats
To establish whether exendin-4 was able to modulate ICP in vivo, we
implanted healthy female adult rats with an ICP monitor (day 0) before
they received daily subcutaneous injections of either saline or exendin-4
(20 mg/kg) for 5 days (day 2 to 6). ICP was measured before and after the
subcutaneous injection on days 2, 4, and 6 (Fig. 4A). Examples of the
ICP traces are shown in Fig. 4B. On the first day of treatment (day 2),
exendin-4 significantly reduced ICP 10 min after the subcutaneous
injection; by 30 min, ICP was 65.2 ± 6.6% of baseline compared to
91.0 ± 3.9% of baseline in saline-treated rats (P < 0.01) (Fig. 4C).
A similar drop in ICP was observed on day 4 (50.4 ± 6.9% of baseline;
P < 0.001) and day 6 (54.5 ± 8.2% of baseline; P < 0.001) 30 min after
exendin-4 administration (Fig. 4, D and E).
In addition to reducing ICP immediately after treatment, exendin-4
had a cumulative effect on reducing ICP. Exendin-4 caused a significant
reduction in ICP measured before dose on day 2 (baseline, 100%) to
day 4 (79.3 ± 7.3%; P < 0.05) and day 6 (72.5 ± 5.6%; P < 0.01) (Fig. 4F),
which was not observed in saline-treated rats [day 2, 100% (baseline);
day 4, 95.5 ± 13.6%; day 6, 105.3 ± 12.5%; Fig. 4G].
Because there is evidence that weight loss can alter ICP (23), weights
were monitored over the treatment period. Although both saline- and
exendin-4–treated rats lost weight during treatment (P < 0.05), there
was no significant difference between the groups at any time point
(Fig. 4H). In the saline group, weight change correlated with altera-
tions in ICP (r = 0.710, P = 0.032), although no relationship was de-
tected for the exendin-4 treatment group (r = −0.300, P = 0.552) (Fig. 4I).
The effect of subcutaneous administration of exendin-4 (20 mg/kg)
on blood and CSF pH and CSF electrolytes was analyzed 60 min after
treatment. Exendin-4 maintained normal blood pH (7.35 ± 0.01;
Fig. 4J); however, it caused a reduction in CSF pH (7.41 ± 0.03;

 P < 0.05) compared to saline (blood pH, 7.35 ± 0.03; CSF pH, 7.61 ±
0.07) (Fig. 4K). CSF Na+ concentration remained unaltered (saline,
150.3 ± 0.9 mM; exendin-4, 150.3 ± 0.6 mM) (Fig. 4L), whereas the
concentration of Cl− ions in the CSF was reduced in the exendin-4
group (117 ± 0.5 mM; P < 0.05) compared to the saline group (123.8 ±
0.9 mM) (Fig. 4M). Exendin-4 treatment also increased the concentra-
tion of Ca2+ ions in the CSF (1.09 ± 0.01 mM; P < 0.05) compared to
saline (1.03 ± 0.02 mM) (Fig. 4N).
Exendin-4 acts via GLP-1R in the brain to reduce ICP in rats
To assess whether the reduction in ICP was specific to the brain, we
injected exendin-4 into the lateral ventricle through an intracerebroven-
tricular cannula in anesthetized rats. Intracerebroventricular delivery of
exendin-4 reduced ICP over time, which was significantly different
from baseline at 15 min (68.9 ± 6.4%; P < 0.05). Intracerebroventricular
delivery of saline also reduced ICP over time (technical effect due to the
intracerebroventricular cannula itself reducing ICP), and this was sig-
nificantly different from baseline at 50 min (74.5 ± 7.9%; P < 0.05). Over
the 60-min ICP measurement, intracerebroventricular delivery of
exendin-4 significantly reduced the area under the curve (AUC) of
ICP compared to saline delivered via the same route (3852 ± 397 versus
4974 ± 262 AUC; P < 0.05) (Fig. 4O). To determine whether the effects
of exendin-4 on ICP were mediated by the GLP-1R, we continuously
infused the antagonist exendin 9-39 (4mg/hour) into the lateralventricle
for 2 days before subcutaneous administration of either saline or
exendin-4 (20 mg/kg). Subcutaneous injection of exendin-4 (ICV
saline + SC exendin-4) lowered ICP (P < 0.0001) compared to a
subcutaneous injection of saline with intracerebroventricular de-
livery of exendin 9-39 (ICV exendin 9-39 + SC saline; Fig. 4P).
Central intracerebroventricular exendin 9-39 infusion decreased
the ICP-lowering effect of subcutaneous exendin-4 at 5 min (ICV
exendin 9-39 + SC exendin-4, 96.7 ± 13.7% versus ICV saline + SC
exendin-4, 65.7 ± 8.3%; P < 0.001) (Fig. 4P). These data suggest that
exendin-4 in part exerts its effects on ICP via the GLP-1R signaling
pathway in the brain.
Exendin-4 reduces ICP in a dose-dependent manner and the
effects last for 24 hours
Rats were treated subcutaneously with exendin-4 (1, 3, and 5 mg/kg) to
determine whether exendin-4 reduces ICP at lower concentrations. At
60 min, exendin-4 (1, 3, and 5 mg/kg) significantly reduced ICP to 79.0 ±
7.0% of baseline (P < 0.05), 69.9 ± 8.8% of baseline (P < 0.0001), and
60.6 ± 3.6% of baseline (P < 0.0001), respectively, compared to saline
(97.2 ± 2.5% of baseline) (Fig. 5, A and B). Exendin-4 (5 mg/kg)
showed the greatest reduction in ICP, and the effect was still present
3 hours after the treatment (P < 0.001). Conversely, in the 1 and 3 mg/kg
exendin-4 groups, ICP had returned to baseline by 3 hours (Fig. 5C).
Alterations in mRNA and protein expression of GLP-1R and mole-
cules involved in CSF secretion were assessed in the choroid plexus of
rats 3 hours after treatment with exendin-4 (1, 3, and 5 mg/kg). Glp-1r
and Na+ K+ atpase mRNA expression was not altered by exendin-4
treatment (Fig. 5, D and E). Conversely, there was a twofold increase
in the amount of Aqp1 mRNA in the 5 mg/kg exendin-4 treatment
group (P < 0.05) (Fig. 5F) and a fourfold increase in the amount of
Nhe1 mRNA expression in the 1 mg/kg exendin-4 treatment group
(P < 0.05) (Fig. 5G). Although no significant changes were observed

did not change over the 24-hour period (Fig. 6, E, F, and H). As shown
previously, exendin-4 (5 mg/kg) increased Aqp1 mRNA expression at
3 hours compared to saline, although this was not observed at any
other time point (Fig. 6G). There were also no significant changes in
the amount of Na+ K+ ATPase or AQP1 protein over the 24-hour time

Exendin-4 treatment reduces ICP in a rodent model of
raised ICP
To determine the efficacy of exendin-4 to reduce ICP under conditions
of raised ICP, we used a well-characterized kaolin model of hydroceph-
alus in rats. Kaolin, an aluminum silicate, acts as an irritant, inducing an
inflammatory response with concomitant deposition of collagen and
dense fibrosis in areas of the subarachnoid space close to the injection
site, which leads to raised ICP (25, 26). Kaolin was injected into the

 implantation of the ICP monitor. ICP was recorded before and after
a subcutaneous injection of either saline or exendin-4 (20 mg/kg)
(Fig. 7A). The injection of kaolin significantly increased baseline
ICP (11.1 ± 1.3 mmHg; P < 0.0001) compared to that of normal rats
(5.5 ± 0.4 mmHg) (Fig. 7B). Exendin-4 treatment significantly re-
duced ICP almost immediately after the subcutaneous injection and, at
30 min, was 62.6 ± 5.1% of baseline (P < 0.0001) compared to 105.0 ±
4.6% of baseline in saline-treated rats (Fig. 7C). Eight rats in the kaolin
group had baseline ICP values of greater than 10 mmHg and had an av-
erage baseline ICP of 13.7 ± 0.7 mmHg. In these rats (ICP > 10 mmHg),
the ICP values at 30 min were 56.6 ± 5.7% of baseline (n = 4) in the
exendin-4 treatment group compared to 106.7 ± 8.6% of baseline
(n = 4) in the saline treatment group (Fig. 7C). In the rodents with
elevated ICP, the ICP waveform was very unstable, with the appearance
of B-waves characteristic of pathologically elevated ICP and a reduc-
tion in brain compliance (27). These were abolished in rats receiving
exendin-4 but not saline (Fig. 7D).
DISCUSSION
The aim of the present study was to establish whether GLP-1 had a role
in modulating CSFsecretion and ICP. We were able to demonstrate that
the GLP-1R agonist exendin-4 was able to reduce ICP in conscious
healthy female rats and in a rat model of raised ICP. In addition, our
results suggest that the ICP-lowering properties of exendin-4 may occur
through reduced CSF secretion at the choroid plexus, implied by the

 reduction in Na+ K+ ATPase activity in CPe cells. Furthermore, our data
suggest that exendin-4 modulates CSF production in vitro through the
GLP-1R/cAMP/PKA signaling pathway.
Alvarez et al. (15) first described the presence of the GLP-1R in the
rat ependyma and choroid plexus by in situ hybridization but did not
characterize the cellularlocalization of thisreceptor. Ourstudiescorrob-
orate these findings and demonstrate further that GLP-1R mRNA and
protein are present in both rat and human choroid plexus. We localized
the GLP-1R protein in tissue sections of the human choroid plexus to
the CPe cells using a monoclonal antibody and showed the presence
of the receptor in the rat choroid plexus using fluorescently tagged
exendin-4. We note that no specific antibody exists for mouse/rat
tissue, so rodent tissue was not examined for GLP-1R protein expres-
sion. In any case, our studies are in keeping with others showing lo-
calization of the GLP-1R in monkey kidney and human GLP-1R
transfected cells (20, 21). G protein–coupled receptors undergo inter-
nalization, trafficking, and recycling/degradation after agonist stimula-
tion (28). We speculate that such dynamics may allow the GLP-1R to be
stimulated from both sides of the choroid plexus (fig. S2A). Although
GLP-1R mRNA and protein expression were, in general, low, it has
recently been shown that activation of the receptor requires femto- to
picomolar concentrations of GLP-1R, so even faced with low abun-
dance, signaling would be expected in the presence of exendin-4 (29).
We successfully cultured monolayers of rat CPe cells, which we used
as an in vitro cell culture model of the rat choroid plexus to assess CSF
secretion. The Na+ K+ ATPase islocalized to the apical surface and is the
driving force for transporting Na+ ions from the choroid plexus into the
CSF against its concentration gradient. Many studies have demon-
strated that modulation of Na+ K+ ATPase expression or activity direct-
ly correlates with CSF secretion (6, 30–33). We were able to show that
exendin-4 reduces Na+ K+ ATPase activity, suggesting reduced CSF
secretion at the choroid plexus. Previous studies have shown similar
effects of exendin-4 on Na+ K+ ATPase activity in the renal system
(34). In kidney proximal tubule epithelial cells and pancreatic b cells,
GLP-1 modulates Na+ concentration through increased cAMP and
PKA activation (18, 35). Using two different techniques, exendin-4
was seen to induce a concentration-dependent rise in cAMP in the cho-
roidplexus,whichwasinhibitedby the GLP-1Rantagonistexendin9-39.
Furthermore, a PKI blocked the effects of exendin-4 on Na+ K+ ATPase
activity, although we acknowledge that such approaches can be non-
specific and further studies using specific knockout animals are required.
Altogether, these data indicate that the cAMP/PKA-dependent pathway
may be involved in the GLP-1R–mediated reduction in CSF secretion at
the choroid plexus. In the kidney, GLP-1R agonist treatment increases
diuresis through phosphorylation of the Na+ H+ exchanger (18, 36).
There are PKA phosphorylation sites present on both the Na+ H+ ex-
changer and the Na+ K+ ATPase (37); therefore, in the choroid plexus,
phosphorylation of either the Na+ H+ exchanger or the Na+ K+ ATPase
may result in inhibition of Na+ transport across the cells and thus CSF
production (fig. S2, B and C). In the choroid plexus, the Na+ K+ ATPase
can also be phosphorylated by PKC (37). GLP-1R is able to signal
through the PKC pathway in pancreatic b cells (29, 38, 39). Therefore,
the GLP-1R/PKC signaling pathway may also have a role in reducing
CSF secretion and warrants further investigation.
The key finding of this study is that subcutaneous exendin-4 treat-
ment is able to reduce ICP in vivo in normal rats and rats with raised
ICP.Inaddition,theeffectonICPof asingleadministration ofexendin-4
lasted for 24 hours, and cumulative dosing reduced the pre-dose ICP.
Thissuggeststhatexendin-4maybeableto maintainlowICPoveralong
period. This is an important advance, because there are very limited spe-
cific therapeutic options to clinically reduce and maintain low ICP under
conditions of raised ICP. The main therapeutic agent for managing
chronic raised ICP is acetazolamide, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor.
However, in idiopathic intracranial hypertension, acetazolamide is as-
sociated with limited efficacy and poor tolerability (48% withdrawal)
(2) and is contraindicated for use in premature infants with post-
hemorrhagic hydrocephalus (40). On the other hand, treatment with

ICP was recorded overnight to allow the ICP to normalize after implantation. On day 7,

(20 mg/kg) (n = 6), and the ICP was recorded for a further 60 min. (B) Dot plot showing

 incretin mimetics is generally well tolerated, with the main side effects
being transient nausea, constipation, and diarrhea, and these drugs do
not induce hypoglycemia (41). In patients taking the GLP-1R agonist
liraglutide, drug withdrawal due to side effects was only 5.4% in the
cohort receiving the highest dose [3 mg; (12)].
However, there are a number of limitations to the present study. To
determine the central actions of exendin-4 on ICP, we had to deliver
exendin-4 directly into the brain’s ventricular system. The injection
itself may have a direct effect on ICP and could mask any changes in
ICP relating to the treatment. To try to minimize these effects, we
implanted an intracerebroventricular cannula 2 days before the
injection. Nonetheless, because it was not possible to completely seal
the system, ICP showed a slight decrease in saline-treated rats. How-
ever, we were still able to establish a significant reduction in ICP with
exendin-4 treatment. The study design was also limited by the lack of
blinding during the intervention, although the data were analyzed by
different individuals with the same outcome. ICP was monitored
continuously via automated software, thus removing measurement
bias. It will be of interest to study prolonged dosing in a rat model of
hydrocephalus in the future. However, this will require considerable
technicaloptimization,given that ICPisnotoriously difficult to measure
in such models where recordings are typically only accurate immediate-
ly before euthanasia (42, 43).
GLP-1R agonists also have peripheral actions that have the potential
to indirectly affect ICP. Although incretin mimetics have been shown to
acutely increase heart rate and blood pressure (44), hypertension would
be expected to cause the opposite effect to that seen here due to
increased choroid plexus permeability and fluid secretion (45, 46).
Our data imply that the effect of exendin-4 on ICP dynamics is through
central mechanisms, because intracerebroventricular infusion of
exendin 9-39 partially inhibited the action of subcutaneous exendin-4.
Exendin 9-39 may not have fully inhibited the actions of exendin-4,
because the inhibitor was infused into the ventricle rather than being
given as a bolus injection. However, it is also possible that the effects
of exendin-4 are not fully mediated by GLP-1R, and this requires
further investigation. Previous studies have also demonstrated only
moderate effects on attenuating exendin-4–induced food intake sup-
pression at early time points after intracerebroventricular bolus of
exendin 9-39 (47). Nevertheless, the central actions of exendin-4
are further supported by the fact that exendin-4 lowered CSF pH,
whereas blood pH remained unchanged, which is supported by other
studies showing that GLP-1 does not affect blood pH (19). It remains
unclear how the subcutaneous administration of the GLP-1R agonist
exendin-4 exerts its central effects on the choroid plexus. After sub-
cutaneous administration, circulating exendin-4 may cross the fenes-
trated capillaries in the choroid plexus and stimulate the GLP-1R
on the basolateral side of the CPe cells. Otherwise, it is possible that
exendin-4 crossed the blood-brain barrier (48, 49) or entered the CSF
via the circumventricular organs, where it is able to stimulate the re-
ceptors on the apical surface of the CPe cells. Liraglutide readily
crosses into the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (50), and in vivo im-
aging studies in rodents using fluorescently tagged ghrelin show pas-
sage of the gut peptide to the same region via fenestrated capillaries
of the median eminence (51). Last, exendin-4 may stimulate vagal
afferents that project to the nucleus tractus solitarius (11). This may lead
to secretion of GLP-1 through a widespread network of fibers projecting
to the third ventricle, allowing GLP-1 to enter the CSF (fig. S2A).
In summary, exendin-4 reduces Na+ K+ ATPase activity at the cho-
roid plexus, implying a reduction in CSF secretion, and lowers ICP in
conscious rats with and without elevated ICP. This work demonstrates
that GLP-1R agonists may provide an alternative treatment for raised
ICP under conditions such as idiopathic intracranial hypertension and
hydrocephalus and warrant further clinical investigation in humans.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
The main aim of this study was to explore the potential of exendin-4, a
GLP-1R agonist, to modulate CSF secretion and subsequently reduce
ICP. Three experimental studies were performed: (i) in vitro analysis
of the GLP-1R and downstream signaling pathway in human and rat
choroid plexus, where GLP-1R expression was determined through
mRNA analysis, immunostaining of human choroid plexus tissue
sections, and fluorescently tagged exendin-4 binding to rat choroid
plexus explants. The downstream signaling pathway was assessed in
rat CPe cellculture by measuring cAMP generation andNa+K+ATPase
activity. In vivo studies to determine the efficacy of exendin-4 to reduce
ICP were conducted in (ii) healthy rats and (iii) a pathological model of
raised ICP, a rat model of hydrocephalus. The sample size (n = 4 to 9
per experimental group) for the in vivo studies was based on the re-
source equation because the effects size was unknown. Exact numbers
for each experiment are included below and in the figure legends. The
investigators were not blinded when conducting or evaluating the
experiments, and the rats were randomly assigned to the treatment
and control groups.
Human tissue
Human choroid plexus samples were obtained from the Parkinson’s
UK Brain Bank at Imperial College, London under the ethical approval
oftheWalesResearchEthicsCommittee(referenceno.08/MRE09/31+5).
Informed consent was obtained for the use of postmortem tissue for
research. Samples were stored in RNAlater at −80°C before being pro-
cessed for quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) following the
protocolstatedinSupplementaryMaterialsandMethods.Pooledhuman
pancreas (540023), heart (540011), and ovary (540071) RNA was pur-
chased from Agilent Technologies. Fresh choroid plexus samples were
fixed in 4% formaldehyde before embedding in paraffin wax.
Experimental animals
For the in vitro work, female Sprague-Dawley rats (150 to 200 g; Charles
River Laboratories) were used at the University of Birmingham in ac-
cordance with the Animals and Scientific Procedures Act 1986, licensed
by the UK Home Office and approved by the University of Birmingham
Ethics Committee. For the in vivo studies, which were conducted in
Rigshospitalet-Glostrup, female Sprague-Dawley rats (150 to 250 g;
Taconic) were housed in groups of four and kept under a 12-hour
light/dark cycle with free access to food and water. All experimental
procedures were approved by the Danish Animal Experiments In-
spectorate (license no. 2014-15-0201-00256 and 2012-15-2934-00283).
After treatments and surgical procedures, the rats were monitored daily
for any adverse effects. Female rats were used to ensure that the results
were relevant to conditions such as idiopathic intracranial hypertension.
Daily subcutaneous injections of exendin-4 in normal
conscious rats
On day 0, the epidural ICP probe was implanted, and the animal was
allowed to recover. On days 2, 4, and 6, for the ICP recordings, the rats
were sedated with midazolam (2.5 mg/kg, subcutaneously) in an in-
fusion cage (InstechLaboratories),whichhada swirllever arm to ensure

 unhindered movement. A stable baseline ICP reading was recorded for
around 30 min before the rats received a subcutaneous injection of
either saline (n = 9) or exendin-4 (20 mg/kg) (n = 9). ICP was recorded
for a further 60 min after which the rat was returned to its normal cage.
The daily subcutaneous injections of saline or exendin-4 were per-
formed at similar times of the day for each rat.
Intracerebroventricular injection of exendin-4 in
anesthetized rats
To determine whether the effects of exendin-4 on ICP were due to cen-
tral activity, we fitted the rats with an intracerebroventricular cannula at
the same time as the epidural ICP probe implantation and allowed the
rat to recover. Subsequent ICP recordings during exendin-4 treatment
were done under anesthesia. A stable baseline ICP reading was recorded
for around 30 min before the following treatments were then
administered intracerebroventricularly in a counterbalance design: (i)
1 ml of saline (n = 8) and (ii) exendin-4 (0.3 mg/ml) (n = 6). ICP was
recorded for a further 60 min after which the rat was allowed to recover.
Injection treatments were separated by 2 to 3 days.
Continuous intracerebroventricular infusion of exendin 9-39
with subcutaneous injection of exendin-4 in conscious rats
To determine whether the effects of exendin-4 on ICP are through the
GLP-1R, we fitted the rats with an osmotic pump attached to an intra-
cerebroventricular cannula containing either saline or exendin 9-39 at
the same time asthe epidural ICP probe implantation. On day 2, the rats
were sedated, and a stable baseline was recorded before a subcutaneous
injection of either saline or exendin-4 (20 mg/kg). ICP was then recorded
for a further 60 min. The rats were therefore assigned to three treatment
groups: (i) saline-filled osmotic pump with subcutaneous injection of
exendin-4 (ICV saline + SC exendin-4; n = 6), (ii) exendin 9-39–filled
osmoticpumpwithsubcutaneousinjectionof saline(ICVexendin9-39+
SC saline; n = 5), and (iii) exendin 9-39–filled osmotic pump with
subcutaneous injection of exendin-4 (ICV exendin 9-39 + SC
exendin-4; n = 6).
Exendin-4 dose response and time course experiment
Rats underwent the same procedure as outlined in the first experiment.
For the dosing experiment, the rats were given exendin-4 (1 mg/kg,
n=6;3 mg/kg,n= 6; or 5mg/kg, n= 6), andICPwasrecorded for3hours.
For the time course experiment, rats were given either saline (n = 18
for ICP data but only 4 were used for choroid plexus analysis) and ICP
was recorded for 24 hours or exendin-4 (5 mg/kg) and ICP was recorded
for 6 (n = 6), 12 (n = 6), and 24 hours (n = 12 for ICP data but only 6
were used for choroid plexus analysis). After each time point, the rats
were sacrificed with an overdose of euthatal and transcardially perfused
with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The choroid plexus was then
dissected, frozen immediately, and stored at −80°C for qPCR and
Western blot analysis (described in detail in Supplementary Materials
and Methods).
Subcutaneous injection of exendin-4 in conscious
hydrocephalic rats
We used the kaolin model of hydrocephalus as our model of raised ICP.
On day 0, the rats received an injection of kaolin to induce hydroceph-
alus and were allowed to recover. On days6 to 8, the ratswere fitted with
an epidural ICP probe and were then allowed to recover in the infusion
cages still connected to the transducer so that the ICP could be contin-
uously measured overnight to establish raised ICP. The following
morning, after establishing that the baseline ICP reading was stable,
the rats received a subcutaneous injection of either saline (n = 6; n = 4,
>10 mmHg) or exendin-4 (20 mg/kg) (n = 6; n = 4, >10 mmHg). ICP
was then recorded for a further 60 min.
Statistical analysis
Values are represented as means and SEM. Most of the data were ana-
lyzed using GraphPad Prism software; however, the time course exper-
iment with exendin-4 (5 mg/kg) was analyzed using SPSS because of
missing data points. For the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
cAMP analysis, the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test was used
followed by Mann-Whitney test (two-tailed) with the appropriate ad-
justment for multiple comparisons (Bonferroni). t test or one-way
ANOVA (followed by Tukey post hoc test) was used for the compar-
ison of qPCR, Western blot, and Na+ K+ ATPase activity. Two-way
ANOVA with Sidak’s multiple comparisons test was used for the com-
parison of ICP between two groups over a period of time. Values were
considered statistically significant when P values were *P < 0.05, **P <
0.01, ***P < 0.001, and ****P < 0.0001. Individual leveldata are included
