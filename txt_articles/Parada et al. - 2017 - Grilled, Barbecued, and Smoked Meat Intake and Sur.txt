Abstract
Background: Grilled, barbecued, and smoked meat intake, a prevalent dietary source of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon
(PAH) carcinogens, may increase the risk of incident breast cancer. However, no studies have examined whether intake of
this PAH source influences survival after breast cancer.
Methods: We interviewed a population-based cohort of 1508 women diagnosed with first primary invasive or in situ breast
cancer in 1996 and 1997 at baseline and again approximately five years later to assess grilled/barbecued and smoked meat in-
take. After a median of 17.6 years of follow-up, 597 deaths, of which 237 were breast cancer related, were identified.
Multivariable Cox regression was used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for mortal-
ity as related to prediagnosis intake, comparing high (above the median) to low intake, as well as postdiagnosis changes in in-
take, comparing every combination of pre-/postdiagnosis intake to low pre-/postdiagnosis intake. All statistical tests were
two-sided.
Results: High prediagnosis grilled/barbecued and smoked meat intake was associated with increased risk of all-cause mortal-
ity (HR ¼ 1.23, 95% CI ¼ 1.03 to 1.46). Other associations were noted, but estimates were not statistically significant. These in-
clude high prediagnosis smoked beef/lamb/pork intake and increased all-cause (HR ¼ 1.17, 95% CI ¼ 0.99 to 1.38, Ptrend ¼ .10)
and breast cancer–specific (HR ¼ 1.23, 95% CI ¼ 0.95 to 1.60, Ptrend ¼ .09) mortality. Also, among women with continued high
grilled/barbecued and smoked meat intake after diagnosis, all-cause mortality risk was elevated 31% (HR ¼ 1.31, 95% CI ¼ 0.96
to 1.78). Further, breast cancer–specific mortality was decreased among women with any pre- and postdiagnosis intake of
smoked poultry/fish (HR ¼ 0.55, 95% CI ¼ 0.31 to 0.97).
Conclusion: High intake of grilled/barbecued and smoked meat may increase mortality after breast cancer.
In the United States, there are over 3.1 million women who are
survivors of breast cancer; these women represent approxi-
mately 40% of female cancer survivors (1). After a diagnosis of
breast cancer, survivors are faced with making behavioral and
dietary choices as they attempt to improve their long-term
prognoses. Dietary changes are one area in which breast cancer
survivors may choose to make more healthful changes. To aid
in this decision-making, recommendations and guidelines are
available for cancer survivors in general (2) and, more recently,
for breast cancer survivors specifically (3). For example, the
American Cancer Society, together with the American Society of
Clinical
Oncology,
recently
released

 survivorship care guidelines, which recommend that survivors
be counseled to “achieve a dietary pattern that is high in vege-
tables, fruits, whole grains, and legumes, and limit alcohol in-
take
to
no
more
than
one
drink
per
day”
(3).
These
recommendations are based on limited, but suggestive, evi-
dence of improved survival among women with such diets (4,5).
No recommendations exist for breast cancer survivors that spe-
cifically address intake of high-temperature cooked meat,
including intake of grilled/barbecued and smoked meat, al-
though, in relation to primary prevention of breast cancer inci-
dence, it is recommended (6) that women limit intake of
processed meats and high-temperature cooked meat because of
the formation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and
other carcinogenic chemicals during the cooking process (7).
Grilled/barbecued and smoked meat intake is a highly preva-
lent source of PAHs among US women (8) and has been associ-
ated with breast cancer incidence (9), but whether intake is
related to survival after breast cancer is unknown. This study
examined whether grilled, barbecued, and smoked meat intake
prior to breast cancer diagnosis, as well as postdiagnosis
changes in intake, is associated with long-term all-cause and
breast cancer–specific mortality among a population-based
sample of women with first primary breast cancer.
Methods
Study Population
Adult female residents of Nassau and Suffolk counties on Long
Island, New York, with a first diagnosis of in situ or invasive breast
cancer between August 1, 1996, and July 31, 1997, were identified
for inclusion in the Long Island Breast Cancer Study Project
(LIBCSP) (10). Identification of patients was done via active daily or
weekly contact with local hospitals and confirmed by physicians
and medical records. After providing written informed consent,
the cohort of 1508 women with breast cancer was interviewed at
home by trained interviewers via structured questionnaire at base-
line, on average within three months of breast cancer diagnosis.
Approximately five years after the initial diagnosis of breast
cancer, the 1414 women who at baseline consented to continued
contact were recontacted for the follow-up interview. Of these,
143 refused, no proxy was identified for 96 women who were not
alive at follow-up, and 55 could not be located, resulting in 1120
women providing consent and 1033 women completing the
follow-up questionnaire (11). The follow-up interview was con-
ducted over the telephone by trained interviewers using a struc-
tured questionnaire that assessed information similar to that
obtained at baseline, but regarding the time period since the ini-
tial diagnosis of breast cancer. Institutional review board ap-
proval was obtained from all participating institutions.
Outcome Assessment
Date of death and cause of death were determined using the
National Death Index (12). Indicators for death from any cause
and those associated with breast cancer were created with
breast cancer deaths identified using International Statistical
Classification of Diseases codes 174.9 and C-50.9 listed on the
death certificate. Follow-up for mortality occurred from the date
of diagnosis in 1996 or 1997 until December 31, 2014. Among the
1508 case women, 597 deaths were identified, 237 (39.7%) of
which were related to breast cancer, after a median duration of
follow-up was 17.6 years (range ¼ 0.2–18.4 years).
Grilled, Barbecued, and Smoked Meat Intake
Assessment
As part of the main baseline questionnaire, participants were
asked about their intake (number of times per week, month, or
year) of four types of grilled/barbecued and smoked meats: 1)
grilled/barbecued beef, lamb, and pork, 2) smoked beef, lamb,
and pork, such as bacon or ham, 3) grilled/barbecued poultry
and fish, and 4) smoked poultry and fish, such as smoked turkey
or lox. The women were asked about their intake in each decade
of life (<20 years, 20–29 years, 30–39 years, 40–49 years, 50–59
years, �60 years) and were asked to specify the seasons in
which the foods were most frequently consumed (8,13). At base-
line, intake during the decade prior to breast cancer diagnosis
was used to represent the average intake before diagnosis; we
also examined whether lifetime intake of grilled/barbecued and
smoked meat was associated with mortality. At the five-year
follow-up, participants responded to the same questions, which
asked about the time period since the baseline questionnaire.
Responses given as per week or per month were first multi-
plied by 52 or by 12, respectively, and then multiplied by the
proportion of the year that the foods were consumed (ie, 25% if
they were consumed during one season, 50% if they were con-
sumed during two seasons, etc.) to obtain measures of intake in
number of times per year. The continuous measures were
dichotomized at the median for each of the four meat types:
grilled/barbecued beef/lamb/pork (low ¼ 0–10 vs high ¼ 11þ
times/year prediagnosis; low ¼ 0–8 vs high ¼ 9þ times/year
postdiagnosis), grilled/barbecued poultry/fish (low ¼ 0–9 vs high
¼ 10þ times/year prediagnosis; low ¼ 0–6 vs high ¼ 7þ times/
year postdiagnosis), smoked barbecued beef/lamb/pork (low ¼
0–4 vs high ¼ 5þ times/year prediagnosis and postdiagnosis),
and smoked poultry/fish (none ¼ 0 vs any intake ¼ 1þ times/
year prediagnosis and postdiagnosis), separately. Intake of the
four meat types were also summed to create an overall measure
of intake of grilled/barbecued and smoked meat (times/year),
which was dichotomized at the median (low ¼ 0–43 vs high ¼
44þ times/year prediagnosis; low ¼ 0–35 vs high ¼ 36þ times/
year postdiagnosis). Lifetime intake of each of the four types of
meat was dichotomized at the median as low ¼ 0–4724 vs high
¼ 4725þ times throughout the lifetime. In the analysis of
postdiagnosis intake of grilled/barbecued and smoked meat,
every combination of prediagnosis/postdiagnosis annual intake
was examined (ie, low/low intake, low/high intake, etc.).
Covariate Assessment
Most covariates were assessed by interviewer-administered
questionnaire. Potential confounders included age at diagnosis
(years),
menopausal
status
(premenopausal
vs
postmeno-
pausal), annual household income (<$15 000–$24 999, $25 000–
$49 999, and �$50 000), education (<high school/high school
graduate, some college/college graduate, and postcollege), mari-
tal status (married or living as married vs not married, divorced,
or widowed), body mass index (continuous, kg/m2), at-diagnosis
physical activity (never, former, and current physical activity of
least one hour per week for three months or more), at-diagnosis
intake of alcoholic beverages such as beer, wine, or liquor
(never, former, and current intake at least once a month for six
months or more), at-diagnosis consumption of energy (kcal/
day), at-diagnosis fruit and vegetable intake (servings/day), and
at-diagnosis multivitamin supplement use (ever/never).

 Other covariates, including estrogen receptor status and
nodal involvement, were determined by medical record review,
and tumor size was obtained from the New York State Cancer
Registry. At baseline, women were interviewed after surgery but
before initiation of most other components of the first course of
treatment for the first primary breast cancer. Therefore, treat-
ment received (radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or hormone
therapy) was assessed by self-report at the follow-up question-
naire, which showed high agreement with medical record data
(kappas ranged from 0.92 to 0.97) (14) but was more complete.
Statistical Analysis
Age-adjusted and multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional haz-
ards models were fit for each of the four types of grilled and
smoked meat intake, separately, and for the total measure of
annual intake and for all-cause and breast cancer–specific mor-
tality. The proportional hazards assumption was verified using
exposure interactions with time. For analyses using breast can-
cer–specific mortality as the outcome, non–breast cancer deaths
were censored at time of death. We estimated hazard ratios
(HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the associations be-
tween prediagnosis, lifetime and average annual intake, as well
as postdiagnosis changes in grilled, barbecued, and/or smoked
meat intake and all-cause and breast cancer–specific mortality.
Tests for trend used continuous measures of grilled/barbecued
and
smoked
intake
in
the
proportional
hazards
models.
Survival time began at the date of breast cancer diagnosis in the
analyses of prediagnosis grilled/barbecued and smoked meat
intake and at the date of the follow-up interview for the corres-
ponding analyses on postdiagnosis intake. Survival time for all
analyses ended at the date of death or, if alive, date of censor-
ing. We also restricted the analysis to women with invasive
cancer only, but results did not differ substantially from those
among all women, so only the latter is shown. All analyses were
done using the Cox Regression function in IBM SPSS Statistics
Version 22.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY).
In the analyses of postdiagnosis changes in grilled/bar-
becued, and smoked meat intake and survival, we employed
multiple imputation to account for the missing exposure data
after excluding 169 women who died within five years of diag-
nosis; 377 (28.2%) participants were lost to follow-up and thus
were missing data on intake of grilled/barbecued and smoked
meat. Missing values were imputed using SPSS, which employs
a fully conditional specification algorithm, an iterative Markov
Chain Monte Carlo procedure that sequentially imputes missing
values starting from the first variable with missing values (15).
SPSS applies linear regression to continuous scale variables,
and logistic or multinomial logistic regression to categorical
variables. We used 25 imputations with 1000 iterations and
included demographics (age at diagnosis, menopausal status,
income, education, marital status, BMI, physical activity, and al-
cohol intake, smoking status), prediagnosis and postdiagnosis
grilled and smoked meat intake, disease characteristics (stage,
tumor size, nodal involvement estrogen receptor status), treat-
ment (radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and hormone therapy),
and the outcome (the event indicator and the Nelson-Aalen es-
timator of the cumulative hazard) (16). As a sensitivity analysis,
we also conducted a complete-case analysis, where the missing
exposure data are ignored. This alternative approach is com-
monly employed in follow-up studies with multiple exposure
assessments over time. However, the imputation approach is
designed to reduce the bias associated with the complete case
analysis (17). In analyses that used follow-up data, survival time
began at the date of completion of the follow-up questionnaire
to the date of death or December 31, 2014, if alive.
All statistical tests were two-sided, and a P value of less than
.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
Participant demographic characteristics, as well as disease,
tumor, and treatment characteristics, are presented in Table 1.
Women with high intake of total grilled/barbecued and smoked
meat were younger at diagnosis (56.7 years vs 60.9 years), and a
higher proportion had an annual income of $50 000 or more
(57.0% vs 40.4%) compared with women with low intake.
Women with high intake were also more likely to be married
(77.2% vs 60.4%). A higher proportion of women with high intake
reported
being
current
alcohol
drinkers
(51.9%
vs
43.2%).
Disease and treatment characteristics were similar across total
intake
of grilled/barbecued
and smoked meat,
except for
chemotherapy; receipt of chemotherapy was reported by 45.8%
of women with high intake compared with 36.7% of women
with low intake.
Prediagnosis Intake of Grilled/Barbecued and
Smoked Meat
Table 2 shows the associations between prediagnosis annual in-
take of grilled/barbecued and smoked meat and mortality.
Compared with low intake, high intake of grilled/barbecued and
smoked meat prior to diagnosis was associated with a 23%
increased hazard (HR ¼ 1.23, 95% CI ¼ 1.03 to 1.46, Ptrend ¼ .02) of
all-cause mortality. High vs low intake of smoked beef/lamb/
pork intake was associated with a 17% increased hazard
(HR ¼ 1.17, 95% CI ¼ 0.99 to 1.38, Ptrend ¼ .10) of all-cause and a
23% increased hazard (HR ¼ 1.23, 95% CI ¼ 0.95 to 1.60, Ptrend ¼
.09) of breast cancer–specific mortality, but the confidence inter-
vals include the null value. Lifetime grilled/barbecued and
smoked meat intake and prediagnosis annual intake of grilled/
barbecued beef/lamb/pork and poultry/fish were not associated
with mortality (Table 2).
Postdiagnosis Changes in Intake Grilled, Barbecued, and
Smoked Meat
Table 3 shows the associations between postdiagnosis changes
in annual intake of grilled/barbecued and smoked meat and
mortality after imputation of missing covariates. Compared
with women with low prediagnosis and low postdiagnosis in-
take of grilled/barbecued and smoked meat, continued high in-
take was associated with a 31% increased hazard (HR ¼ 1.31,
95% CI ¼ 0.96 to 1.78) of all-cause mortality. The increase in risk
of death from any cause was similar in magnitude (HR ¼ 1.28,
95%
CI ¼ 0.97
to
1.68)
among
women
who
reported
high
prediagnosis and low postdiagnosis intake of grilled/barbecued
and smoked meat. Smoked beef/lamb/pork intake was posi-
tively associated with all-cause (HR ¼ 1.36, 95% CI ¼ 1.01 to 1.82)
and breast cancer–specific mortality (HR ¼ 1.71, 95% CI ¼ 1.00 to
2.92) among women who had high intake at prediagnosis and
low postdiagnosis intake, relative to low pre- and low postdiag-
nosis intake, but not among women with continued high
postdiagnosis intake. Additionally, women who reported any
pre- and postdiagnosis intake of smoked poultry and fish had a
reduced risk of breast cancer mortality (HR ¼ 0.55, 95% CI ¼ 0.31

 to 0.97) compared with no intake at pre- and postdiagnosis.
Postdiagnosis changes in intake of grilled/barbecued poultry/
fish were not associated with all-cause and breast cancer–spe-
cific mortality. Age-adjusted results from the complete-case
analyses are presented in Supplementary Table 1 (available on-
line), which are mostly similar to the imputation-based results,
except for total grilled/barbecued and smoked meat intake,
which are null in the complete-case analysis.
Discussion
In this population-based prospective study of grilled/barbecued
and smoked meat intake and mortality among a cohort of
women
diagnosed
with
first
primary
breast
cancer,
high
prediagnosis
annual
intake
of
total
grilled/barbecued
and
smoked meat was statistically significantly associated with an
elevated risk of all-cause mortality. Additionally, when con-
sidering postdiagnosis changes in intake, we observed that
women who continued to consume a high amount of grilled/
barbecued
and
smoked
meat
after
diagnosis
had
a
31%
increased risk of all-cause mortality. When each of the four
types of grilled/barbecued and smoked meat were examined in-
dividually, some associations were noted, but the estimates
were not statistically significant and include the following.
Prediagnosis annual intake of smoked beef/lamb/pork was posi-
tively associated with all-cause and breast cancer–specific mor-
tality. Postdiagnosis smoked beef/lamb/pork intake was also
positively associated with all-cause and breast cancer mortality,
with risk of mortality highest among women who reported high
prediagnosis and low postdiagnosis intake. Risk of breast can-
cer–specific mortality was inversely associated with any pre-
and postdiagnosis intake of smoked poultry/fish.
Grilled and smoked meat intake is a source of polycyclic aro-
matic hydrocarbons, including benzo[a]pyrene, chrysene, and
fluoranthene, and is the primary route of PAH exposure among
nonsmokers (18). PAHs, a group of over 100 different chemicals,
are formed during the incomplete combustion or pyrolysis of or-
ganic substances (19). Specifically, during grilling and barbecu-
ing, PAHs are formed when fat and juices from meat grilled
directly over an open fire drip onto the fire, creating flames and
smoke. The PAHs adhere to the surface of the meat upon con-
tact (20). Wood smoke, which is used to cook and preserve
foods, contains a large number of PAHs, which also contamin-
ate the foods upon contact (21).
Although we could not definitively rule out chance as an ex-
planation for some of our findings, a link between dietary sour-
ces of PAH and breast cancer prognosis is biologically plausible
and epidemiologically consistent. First, these foods have been
previously associated with increased risk of breast cancer inci-
dence; effect estimates range from 1.5 to 2.2 when comparing
the highest to the lowest quantiles of intake of well-done meat
(8,22–25). Second, dietary PAH exposures are hypothesized to be
etiologically related to breast carcinogenesis as PAHs are known
to form DNA adducts, which can cause mutations during DNA
replication and may alter promoter methylation or promoter
binding, leading to inheritable abnormal gene expression, early
steps in carcinogenesis (7). Third, PAHs are also likely to influ-
ence breast cancer development and prognosis through endo-
crine disruption (26). Several PAHs or derivatives including
chrysene and fluoranthene show estrogenic activity in vitro,
while others, such as benzo[k]fluoranthene, benzo[a]pyrene,
and benz[a]anthracene, can be anti-estrogenic (27–29). Thus, as
shown in Figure 1, our study hypothesis is that dietary PAH
sources (and other modifiable factors) may influence breast
cancer prognosis through an estrogen pathway.
Our findings of a possible positive association with death
and intake for smoked beef/lamb/pork may possibly be ex-
plained by the higher saturated fat content of these meats
compared with poultry and fish. Though results are inconsist-
ent, higher risk of mortality has been observed among women
with high intake of total fat, saturated fat, and monounsatu-
rated fat (30–32). Furthermore, higher fat content may also re-
sult in the formation of more PAHs (18). However, we did not
observe the same elevated risk of mortality among women with
continued postdiagnosis high intake and when we examined
at-diagnosis intake of these meats cooked by grilling/barbecu-
ing. The lack of association between mortality and intake of
grilled/barbecued beef/lamb/pork may be due to method of
preparation; marinating meat before grilling, as is often done,
may inhibit the formation of PAHs (33). Our finding of an inverse
association between smoked poultry/fish intake and mortality
could also be related to the different fat composition of these
meats. Moreover, it has been hypothesized that the amino acid
content of white meat supports proper immune system func-
tion (34), while intake of fish, a source of omega-3 polyunsatur-
ated fatty acids, could improve survival (30,35) by reducing
pro-inflammatory derivatives (36). Nonetheless, we did not ob-
serve reductions in mortality risk associated with the intake of
grilled/barbecued poultry/fish intake.
Ours is the first study to examine the associations between
grilled/barbecued and smoked meat intake and mortality after
breast cancer. Strengths of our study include the population-
based cohort design, which utilized data collected shortly after
diagnosis and again five years postdiagnosis. Women were

 followed for over 18 years using the National Death Index,
which has accurate ascertainment of vital status (37).
However, this study also has several limitations. Women were
asked to self-report their intake of grilled/barbecued and smoked
meats. This could have resulted in nondifferential misclassifica-
tion of the exposure, which would bias estimates towards the null
(38). Given the prospective design, approximately 28% of women
did not complete the follow-up assessment. Analyses using a
complete-case approach could result in biased estimates (39);
therefore, we used multiple imputation, a methodologically sound
approach, to address the missing data. Additionally, given the
missingness in the follow-up assessment, we were unable to con-
sider time-varying covariates because of problems with model
convergence. Lastly, given the complexity of diet, it is possible
that our results are confounded by other correlated dietary fac-
tors; however, few dietary exposures have been consistently
linked to breast cancer survival (32).
The results of our study indicate that grilled/barbecued and,
particularly, smoked meat consumed prior to and after breast
cancer diagnosis may influence survival. This study, with con-
firmation by future studies, may help to identify modifiable
prognostic indicators for the more than 3 million women who
are survivors of breast cancer (1).
