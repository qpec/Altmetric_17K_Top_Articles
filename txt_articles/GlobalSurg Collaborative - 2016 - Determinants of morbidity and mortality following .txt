ABSTRACT
Background: Child health is a key priority on the
global health agenda, yet the provision of essential and
emergency surgery in children is patchy in resource-
poor regions. This study was aimed to determine the
mortality risk for emergency abdominal paediatric
surgery in low-income countries globally.
Methods: Multicentre, international, prospective,
cohort study. Self-selected surgical units performing
emergency abdominal surgery submitted prespecified
data for consecutive children aged <16 years during a
2-week period between July and December 2014. The
United Nation’s Human Development Index (HDI) was
used to stratify countries. The main outcome measure
was 30-day postoperative mortality, analysed by
multilevel logistic regression.
Results: This study included 1409 patients from
253 centres in 43 countries; 282 children were under
2 years of age. Among them, 265 (18.8%) were from
low-HDI, 450 (31.9%) from middle-HDI and 694
(49.3%) from high-HDI countries. The most common
operations performed were appendectomy, small bowel
resection, pyloromyotomy and correction of
intussusception. After adjustment for patient and
hospital risk factors, child mortality at 30 days was
significantly higher in low-HDI (adjusted OR 7.14
(95% CI 2.52 to 20.23), p<0.001) and middle-HDI
(4.42 (1.44 to 13.56), p=0.009) countries compared
with high-HDI countries, translating to 40 excess
deaths per 1000 procedures performed.
Conclusions: Adjusted mortality in children following
emergency abdominal surgery may be as high as
7 times greater in low-HDI and middle-HDI countries
compared with high-HDI countries. Effective provision
of emergency essential surgery should be a key priority
for global child health agendas.

INTRODUCTION
Little data are available addressing the safety
profile and risk factors affecting morbidity
and
mortality
in
children
undergoing
surgery globally. Most studies have been in
adults and almost invariably were performed
in high-resource countries.1–3 Although it is
estimated that about 234 million surgical pro-
cedures are performed annually worldwide,
the percentage of these involving children
remains unknown.4
Studies from low- and middle-income coun-
tries (LMICs) have shown that in the neonatal
period, mortality is associated with sepsis, mul-
tiple exposures to anaesthesia (reoperation),
postoperative bleeding and complex congeni-
tal anomalies.5–8 Other risk factors include
non-availability of trained personnel, delayed
presentation, childbirth outside a hospital
and financial constraints of the caregivers.9–11
Emergency
surgery
generally
carries
a
higher morbidity and mortality compared with
elective procedures.12 13 An estimated 33 000
emergency laparotomies in all ages are per-
formed annually in the UK with a 15–20%
Key questions
What is already known about this topic?
▸ There are little prospective data describing the
outcomes of paediatric surgery in low-resource
settings.
▸ Emergency surgery is associated with more
deaths and complications than elective surgery,
but most studies carried out until now are in
adults.
What are the new findings?
▸ After accounting for differences in case mix, the
odds
of
death
after
emergency
abdominal
surgery could be as high as seven times greater
in low-income countries compared with high-
income countries.
Recommendations for policy
▸ The provision of effective essential surgery
should be a key priority for global child health
agendas and has significant potential to impact
on the global burden of disease.

 mortality, which is 10-fold higher than that of elective
cardiac surgery.14 Reasons for this high mortality are multi-
factorial; as well as patient-related factors, these may
include staffing issues, access to operating theatres or
access to diagnostic investigations.14 Unfortunately, most of
these evidences have been derived from adult populations.
To date, no prospective, multicentre, international
investigation has evaluated the determinants of morbid-
ity or mortality after emergency abdominal surgery in
children on a global scale. The aim of the current study
was to evaluate the mortality and morbidity of emer-
gency abdominal surgery in children across countries of
different human development indices (HDIs).
METHODS
Study design
This was a cohort study of children under the age of
16 years recruited from multiple hospitals performing
emergency abdominal surgery. Predefined data items
were collected according to a previously published
protocol (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02179112)15
using the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap)
which is an online data capture system.16 While the UK
National Health Service Research Ethics review consid-
ered this study exempt from formal research registration
(South East Scotland Research Ethics Service, reference:
NR/1404AB12), individual centres obtained their own
audit, ethical or institutional approval as appropriate.
The collaborative model used has previously been
described elsewhere.17 Investigators from self-selected
surgical
units
identified
consecutive
patients
within
2-week time intervals between 1 July 2014 and 31
December 2014. An open invitation for participation was
disseminated through social media, personal contacts,
email to authors of published emergency surgery studies
and national/international surgical organisations. Short
intensive data collection allowed surgical teams within
these units to contribute meaningful numbers of pat-
ients without requiring additional resources. Multiple 2-
week data collection periods within institutions was
allowed.
Patients and procedures
Any hospital performing emergency abdominal surgery,
which included paediatric patients, could choose to be
included (self-selecting). Consecutive patients under age
of 16 years undergoing emergency abdominal surgery
during a chosen 2-week period between 1 July 2014 and
31 December 2014 were included. Emergency abdom-
inal surgery was defined as any unplanned, non-elective
operation, including reoperation after a previous proced-
ure. Abdominal surgery was defined as any open, laparo-
scopic or laparoscopic-converted procedure that entered
the peritoneal cavity. Elective (planned) or semielective
procedures (where a patient initially admitted as an emer-
gency was then discharged from hospital and readmitted
at a later time for surgery) were excluded.
Data
Data were selected to be objective, standardised, easily
transcribed and internationally relevant, in order to
maximise record completion and accuracy. Recruited
patients were followed up to day 30 after surgery or for
the length of their inpatient stay where follow-up was
not feasible. Records were uploaded by local investiga-
tors to the secure online REDCap website. The lead
investigator at each site validated all cases prior to data
submission. The submitted data were then checked cen-
trally and where missing data were identified, the local
lead investigator was contacted and requested to com-
plete the record. Once vetted, the record was accepted
into the data set for analysis.

 Outcome measures
The primary outcome measure was 30-day postoperative
mortality, defined as the number of patients in the
cohort who died within 30 days of surgery.18 In the event
where 30-day follow-up was unavailable, outcome status
at the point of discharge from hospital was recorded. A
‘30-day postoperative mortality/death during hospital
stay’, is shortened to ‘30-day mortality’ to aid readability.
The secondary outcome measures were 24-hour mortal-
ity, major and minor complication, and surgical site
infection (SSI). Complications were defined on the
Clavien-Dindo scale:19 minor complications as grade I/II
(any deviation from the normal postoperative course
with or without a need for pharmacological treatment
but without requirement for surgical, endoscopic and
radiological interventions or critical care admission);
reintervention as grade III (surgical, endoscopic or
radiological reintervention, without requirement for crit-
ical care admission); and major complication as grade
IV (complication requiring critical care admission).
Statistical analysis
The lack of pre-existing literature data in this subject
meant that an a priori sample size determination was
rendered difficult by unknown factors such as the effect
of clustering and variation in mortality by diagnosis.

 Variation across different international health settings
was assessed by stratifying participating centres by
country into three tertiles according to the Human
Development Index (HDI) rank. This is a composite
statistic
of
life
expectancy,
education
and
income
indices published by the United Nations (http://hdr.
undp.org/en/statistics). Differences between HDI ter-
tiles
were
tested
with
the
Pearson
χ2
test
and
Kruskal-Wallis test for categorical and continuous vari-
ables, respectively.
Fixed effect binary logistic regression models were
explored, and the variables determined to be statistically
and clinically important were entered into full multivari-
able models. Final full model choice was guided by the
Akaike information criterion (AIC). Hierarchical multi-
variable logistic regression models (random intercept)
were constructed with country as the first level and
patients as the second level. HDI tertile and other
explanatory variables were included as fixed effects.
Other than HDI tertile, all fixed effects were considered
at the level of the patient. Coefficients are expressed as
ORs with CIs and p values derived from percentiles of
10 000 bootstrap replications. Level 1 and 2 model resi-
duals were checked and first-order interactions were
tested. Goodness of model fit is reported with the
Hosmer and Lemeshow test,
and
predictive
ability
described by area under the receiver operating charac-
teristic (ROC) curve (c-statistic). All analyses were under-
taken using the R Foundation Statistical Programme (R
3.1.1).
RESULTS
Patients
A total of 1409 patients aged under 16 years, from 253
centres in 43 countries, were included in this study
(figure 1). At the time of operation, 282 (20.0%) were
under the age of 2 years. Of all children, 694 (49.3%)
were from high-HDI, 450 (31.9%) from middle-HDI and
265 (18.8%) from low-HDI groups. There were slightly
more males than females in all HDI groups (table 1)
(55.9% in high-HDI, 61.1% in middle-HDI and 58.1%
in low-HDI groups). Missing data rates were low, with
one missing outcome for 24-hour mortality and one
missing outcome for 30-day mortality. In 1140/1409
patients, 30-day outcomes, which otherwise represent
status at discharge, were confirmed by direct patient
contact (80.9%; high 572/694, 82.4%; middle 358/450,
79.6%; low 210/265, 79.2%; χ2 test, p=0.361).
Demographics
Children undergoing emergency abdominal surgery in
low-HDI countries had higher American Society of
Anaesthesiologists
(ASA)
grades
than
children
in
middle-HDI or high-HDI groups (table 1). Furthermore,
the WHO surgical safety checklist was employed prior to
surgery in less than half of children undergoing emer-
gency
abdominal
surgery
from
the
low-HDI
and
middle-HDI groups compared with over 90% in the
high-HDI group. At operation, 214/1406 (15.2%) of the
children were found to have a perforated viscus, and
this varied with HDI group (high 97/694, 14.0%; middle
49/450, 10.9%; low 68/265, 25.7%). Use of laparoscopy
was widespread in high-HDI nations (341/694, 49.1%),
whereas in middle-HDI (30/450, 6.7%) and low-HDI
(8/257,
3.0%)
settings,
rates
were
much
lower
(p<0.001).
Appendicitis was the most common indication for
undergoing surgery across all groups, followed by con-
genital
abnormalities,
intussusception
and
hernia
(figure
2A
and
online
supplementary
table
S1).
Emergency abdominal surgery for congenital abnormal-
ities was significantly higher in low-HDI groups com-
pared with middle-HDI and high-HDI groups (14.3% cf.
1.8% and 3.2%, respectively).

 Mortality
Overall, 30-day mortality following surgery was 2.9%
(n=41/1409) (figure 3). Of these deaths, 29.3% (n=12/
41) occurred within 24 hours and 70.7% (n=29/41)
between 24 hours and 30 days. Mortality varied signifi-
cantly with HDI, with significantly higher proportions in
low-HDI countries at 24 hours (0.3% in high-HDI, 0.7%
in middle-HDI and 2.6% in low-HDI groups, p=0.005)
and 30 days (0.9% in high-HDI, 2.9% in middle-HDI
and 8.3% in low-HDI groups, p<0.001). Other associa-
tions with 24-hour and 30-day mortality in univariable
analyses included neonatal age, >1 ASA grade and non-
appendicitis procedures. Perforated viscus was significantly
associated with 30-day mortality. An inversely propor-
tional relationship is seen between 30-day mortality and
age in all HDI groups even after adjustment in models
(figure 2C).
In multilevel models, the association between low-HDI
country, and 24-hour (OR 7.08, 95% CI 1.39 to 36.10,
p=0.018) (table 2) and 30-day mortality (OR 7.79, 95%
CI
2.96
to
20.48,
p<0.001)
(table
3)
persisted.
Middle-HDI country was associated with a 30-day mortal-
ity (OR 5.57, 95% CI 1.90 to 16.39, p=0.002) but not
24-hour mortality. A perforated viscus was significantly
associated
with
increased
30-day
mortality,
whereas
appendicitis was associated with lower 24-hour and
30-day mortality compared with other indications.
An analysis of predicted excess deaths was performed
using the final multilevel 30-day mortality model. Based
on this model, if all children in low-HDI and middle-HDI

countries but otherwise had the same characteristics, 29
lesser deaths are predicted (40 per 1000 procedures).
Major complications and reintervention
The overall rate of major complications following emer-
gency
abdominal
surgery
was
7.2%
(n=102/1409)
(figure 2B and online supplementary table S2). Major
complications
were
significantly
more
common
in
low-HDI countries (11.3%, 30/265) compared with
middle-HDI and high-HDI countries (6.4%, 29/450 and
6.2% 43/694, respectively, p=0.017). The rate of reinter-
vention across the HDI groups mirrors these complica-
tions rates (low 6.8%, middle 4.4%, high 4.2%, p=0.222;
online supplementary table S3).
Minor complications
Across all HDI groups, the minor complication rate
(Clavien-Dindo I-II) was 14.8% (n=208). This varied
across HDI groups, with higher rates in low-HDI coun-
tries (20.9%) compared with middle-HDI and high-HDI
countries (13.1% and 13.8% respectively, p=0.010), but
these differences did not persist in multivariable analysis
(see online supplementary table S4).
Surgical site infection
The overall SSI rate was 9.3% (n=131). This varied sig-
nificantly across HDI groups (low 21.1%, middle 9.6%,
high 4.6%, p<0.001, online supplementary table S5).
DISCUSSION
The main findings of this study are sevenfold and four-
fold
higher
30-day
mortalities
in
low-HDI
and
middle-HDI
countries,
respectively,
compared
with
high-HDI countries. These rates are considerably greater
than the threefold higher mortality previously reported
among adult patients in low-HDI countries and account
for an excess 40 deaths per thousand procedures in
low-HDI and middle-HDI compared with high-HDI
countries in this study alone.20 The risk factors for this
excess mortality are necessarily multifactorial, including
a higher intestinal perforation rate, which may reflect
delayed access to surgery and different patterns of
disease.
The twofold higher rate of major and minor post-
operative complications and the fivefold difference in
SSIs are also noteworthy. Our study does not allow us to
identify the main factors responsible for these differ-
ences, but other studies in the literature point out a
variety of aetiological factors including sepsis, multiple
exposure
to
anaesthesia
in
the
neonatal
period,

through lack of resources including training in use of
such technology.22
The study was able to draw from a large and diverse
patient population, spanning wide geographical and
resource areas globally. Despite the convenience sam-
pling employed, it offers a snapshot of essential paediat-
ric surgery across the globe. The main body of data from
the study highlights the differences in pathology, patient
premorbid
status,
operative
findings
and
outcomes
based on HDI grouping. The higher ASA status of chil-
dren
requiring
emergency
abdominal
surgery
in
low-HDI and middle-HDI countries settings is concern-
ing, and it potentially reflects delayed access to care with
the consequent negative impact on postoperative out-
comes. Similarly, the percentage of perforated viscus
encountered at surgery was also significantly higher in
low-HDI and middle-HDI countries. The delay in access
to care has been previously reported by studies from
LMICs.9–11 This may account for the poor survival of
neonates with severe congenital anomalies in these set-
tings, such as intestinal atresia, abdominal wall defects
and oesophageal atresia.11 23 A study from Nigeria indi-
cated that delayed intervention time >72 hours, neonatal
age and severe postoperative complications are asso-
ciated
with
higher
mortality
in
paediatric
surgical
emergencies.21
This study has some limitations. Being based on con-
venience sampling of hospitals, the data collected may
not be truly representative of other sites which may be
more poorly resourced. Collection bias, however, may
result in the true outcomes being even worse in LMICs,
as the lowest resource sites would be less likely to partici-
pate. In addition, other factors such as availability of per-
sonnel, availability of complex anaesthetic and intensive
care support, and delay time before surgery were not
analysed in this study but may significantly impact on
postoperative mortality. The current study has documen-
ted differences in surgical outcomes in children based
on HDI groups, but has not explored in depth the
reasons for these differences. This will form the agenda

 for future studies, together with outcome studies, focus-
ing on elective essential surgical procedures in children.
The main conclusion of this study is that emergency
abdominal surgery in children is associated with signifi-
cantly worse outcomes in LMICs. The documentation pro-
vided by this study is essential to the process of scaling up
surgical services for children in low-resource settings.
Good surgical outcomes require a multitude of factors,
including trained personnel, good facilities and surgical
supplies, as well as prompt access to surgical care. Thus,
any single intervention in this multifaceted system has a
high likelihood of failing to fully address these complex
issues. This relates to many well-meaning efforts from
high-income countries
(HICs)
to
assist
surgically in
resource-limited settings. For instance, temporary plat-
forms in the form of ‘surgical safaris’, the provision of sur-
gical equipment alone, or short-term training courses
outside one’s normal work setting will likely have little
long-term impact.24
25 The likeliest context in which
broad systematic change can occur is likely that of a long-
lasting institutional partnership. In such a context of rela-
tionship with mutual understanding and trust, appropriate
change can be implemented in whichever areas are most
needed, and progress can be monitored and evaluated.26
The recent global recognition of surgery as an essen-
tial
healthcare
component
has
provided
a
unique
impetus for provision of essential surgical services, espe-
cially in LMICs.27 28 The task ahead is a huge one, in
terms of access to and quality of care. The current study
has documented relatively poor outcomes of emergency
abdominal
surgery
in
children
in
low-HDI
and
middle-HDI
countries.
Such
data
are
essential
in
guiding efforts to improve the surgical care of children
globally and prioritise it in the global health agenda.
