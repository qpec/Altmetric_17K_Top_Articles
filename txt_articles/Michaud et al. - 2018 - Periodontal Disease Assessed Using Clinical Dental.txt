Abstract
Background: While evidence is increasingly consistent with a positive association between periodontitis and cancer
risk, most studies have relied on self-reported periodontitis. In this study, we prospectively evaluated the association
of periodontal disease severity with cancer risk in black and white older adults in a cohort study that included a dental
examination.
Methods: Included were 7466 participants in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study cohort who at visit 4 (1996–1998)
reported being edentulous or underwent the dental examination. Probing depth and gingival recession were measured at six
sites on all teeth; these measurements were used to define periodontal disease severity. Incident cancers (n ¼ 1648) and
cancer deaths (n ¼ 547) were ascertained during a median of 14.7 years of follow-up. All statistical tests were two-sided.
Results: An increased risk of total cancer (hazard ratio [HR] ¼ 1.24, 95% confidence interval [CI] ¼ 1.07 to 1.44, Ptrend ¼ .004)
was observed for severe periodontitis (>30% of sites with attachment loss >3 mm) compared with no/mild periodontitis
(<10% of sites with attachment loss >3 mm), adjusting for smoking and other factors. Strong associations were observed for
lung cancer (HR ¼ 2.33, 95% CI ¼ 1.51 to 3.60, Ptrend < .001), and elevated risks were noted for colorectal cancer for severe
periodontitis, which were significant among never smokers (HR ¼ 2.12, 95% CI ¼ 1.00 to 4.47). Associations were generally
weaker, or not apparent among black participants, except for lung and colorectal cancers, where associations were similar by
race. No associations were observed for breast, prostate, or hematopoietic and lymphatic cancer risk.
Conclusions: This study provides additional evidence that cancer risk, especially for lung and colorectal cancer, is elevated
in individuals with periodontitis. Additional research is needed to understand cancer site–specific and racial differences in
findings.
Evidence is mounting that periodontal disease is associated with
cancer risk, but questions remain regarding the magnitude of the
associations and which cancers are impacted. Existing studies ex-
amining periodontal disease and cancer risk have various limita-
tions, including use of self-reported diagnosis of periodontal
disease (1–3), lack of adjustment for smoking (4,5), or few cancer
cases (6). Despite limitations, all six prospective cohort studies
evaluating total cancer reported positive associations, with
increased risks of 14% to 20% (3,7) in those adjusting for smoking,
the major risk factor for both periodontal disease and cancer.

caused by oral bacterial dysbiosis (8), affects both local and sys-

risk through changes in immune response, or alternatively,
through dissemination of harmful bacteria (10). Given that half
of US adults have periodontal disease (11), the public health

 impact of periodontal disease on chronic diseases, including
cancer, needs to be addressed.
Using the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study
cohort, for which standardized data on dental health were col-
lected, and with an average of 15 years of follow-up, we exam-
ined the association between periodontal disease and risk of
total and common cancers in black and white older adult men
and women.
Methods
Study Population
Participants were drawn from the ARIC study, a prospective co-
hort of 15 792 participants age 44 to 66 years recruited from 1987
to
1989
from
Jackson,
Mississippi;
Washington
County,
Maryland; Minneapolis, Minnesota; and Forsyth County, North
Carolina (Supplementary Methods, available online) (12,13). All
attended a baseline examination (visit 1) and were invited for
three follow-up visits over 10 years. A clinical dental examina-
tion took place during the fourth follow-up visit (1996–1998);
78.6% of participants still alive attended visit 4. Of these, 58.3%
were eligible and consented to the dental examination. For this
analysis, we excluded participants who had a cancer history
prior to visit 4, who did not attend visit 4, and who self-reported
being dentate but were ineligible or refused to participate in the
dental examination (Supplementary Methods, available online).
Finally, we included in the study population 7466 eligible partic-
ipants who attended the dental examination or who self-
reported they were edentulous. Participants provided written
informed consent at each visit. The conduct of ARIC was ap-
proved by institutional review boards at the four field centers
and coordinating center.
Periodontal Measures
During the dental examination, probing depth and gingival reces-
sion were measured at six sites on all teeth (14). These two values
were summed for attachment loss (AL) as a measure of periodon-
tal destruction (Supplementary Methods, available online).
In this study, we present two different classifications be-
cause periodontal disease is a very complex disease—age at ini-
tiation, severity of symptoms and progression, number of teeth
affected, and response to treatment all can vary. Furthermore,
periodontitis is a chronic disease, and while it can be managed
to prevent progression in some patients, in many people it will
always remain a condition that needs to be monitored and
treated; damage to the gum (recession) and bone resorption
caused by the disease is permanent. Periodontitis has been
linked to systemic inflammation (10), and antibodies to bacte-
rial pathogens (to periodontitis) have been measured in blood
(15); however, the exact mechanism linking periodontitis to
cancer is not established, and it is not known what stage of peri-
odontal disease may influence cancer risk. Thus, we present
two different measures of periodontitis severity to address the
complexity of measuring this disease, one previously used in
ARIC that uses clinical attachment level (CAL; “periodontitis
[ARIC]”) (16) and the US Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention–American Academy of Periodontology (CDC-AAP)
definition developed for population-based surveillance of peri-
odontitis, which uses both CAL and pocket depth (PD) measure-
ments
(“periodontitis
[CDC-AAP]”)
(17).

Cancer Ascertainment
Incident cancers were ascertained from 1987 through 2012
through linkage with state cancer registries in Minnesota, North
Carolina, Maryland, and Mississippi, and supplemented by ab-
straction of medical records and hospital discharge codes for
self-reported cases (Supplementary Methods, available online)
(18). Cancer deaths were obtained from death certificates where
cancer was the underlying cause of death. From enrollment
through 2012, we ascertained 4107 first primary cancer cases
and 1661 cancer deaths. Of these, 3748 were first primary can-
cers and 1332 were cancer deaths that occurred after visit 4. Of
these, 1648 and 547, respectively, occurred among those in the
study population over a mean of 14.7 years of follow-up.
Measurement of Risk Factors
Detailed data on demographic (age, race, education), behavior,
and medical conditions were obtained at baseline and during
follow-up visits, including cancer and/or periodontal disease
risk factors. Data from visit 4 or earlier visits was used to adjust
for confounding (Supplementary Methods, available online).
Statistical Analysis
To estimate the association of periodontal disease severity and
edentulism with cancer incidence and mortality, we used Cox
proportional hazards regression to estimate hazard ratios (HRs)
and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of total incident cancer,
smoking-associated cancers, orodigestive cancers, site-specific
cancers with at least 100 cases (prostate 375, lung 226, breast
202, colorectal 162, hematopoietic/lymphatic 129), pancreatic
cancer (because of prior findings for this cancer), and total can-
cer mortality, adjusting for known or suspected risk factors
(Supplementary Methods, available online). Participants con-
tributed time at risk from visit 4 until cancer diagnosis or cancer
death, death due to other causes, or end of follow-up in 2012,
whichever came first. We included a term for edentulous along
with terms for mild (periodontitis [CDC-AAP] only), moderate,
and severe periodontitis separately for the two definitions. We
repeated these analyses separately among black and white par-
ticipants, and stratified on obesity.
We addressed the possibility of competing risks of death due
to other causes by regression analysis (19) for the associations
with total cancer incidence and mortality. We addressed the
possibility of confounding by lifecourse socioeconomic status
(SES) (20) by adjustment and/or effect modification by stratify-
ing (and further adjusting for lifecourse SES within strata) and
testing for statistical interaction. We confirmed the propor-
tional hazards assumption for cancer incidence and mortality
by including an interaction term between a categorical variable
for periodontal disease and the logarithm of follow-up time in
the model and testing its coefficient using the Wald test.
Analyses
were
performed
using
SAS
9.4
(Cary,
NC).
Statistical tests were two-sided, and a P value of less than .05
was considered to be statistically significant.
Results
ARIC participants who underwent the dental examination
(n ¼ 6056 participants) or were edentulous (n ¼ 1410 partici-
pants) were eligible for this analysis. Characteristics of the pop-
ulation are summarized in Tables 1 and 2.

 In the overall study population, being older, male, black,
less educated, obese, or a smoker was more common with
advancing periodontitis severity, regardless of the defini-
tion used (Table 1). Demographic and behavioral character-
istic
distributions
observed
by
periodontal
disease
measures in never smokers (Table 2) were similar to the
overall study.
Among those who underwent the dental examination, most
participants in the overall study population had at least one site
with clinical attachment loss (AL) of 3 mm or larger (94.3%), and
the prevalence increased with age (Table 3). Almost a third
(30.3%) had more advanced AL (�6 mm). The proportion of sites
with advanced AL or PD also increased with age. The prevalence
of advanced PD (�5 mm) was slightly lower among never smok-
ers (Supplementary Table 1, available online).
Using the periodontitis ARIC definition, the Kaplan-Meier es-
timated crude cumulative incidences from visit 4 through 2012
were: no/mild 22.5%, moderate 24.9%, severe 30.8%, and edentu-
lism 29.4%. A 24% increase in risk of total cancer (hazard ratio
[HR] ¼ 1.24, 95% confidence interval [CI] ¼ 1.07 to 1.44, Ptrend ¼
.004) was observed for severe periodontitis (�30% of sites with
AL >3 mm) when compared with no/mild periodontitis (<10%
of sites with AL �3 mm) (Table 4). Similarly, a positive associa-
tion was observed between edentulism and total cancer risk
(HR ¼ 1.28, 95% CI ¼ 1.09 to 1.50) compared with no/mild peri-
odontitis
(Table
4).

 periodontitis and edentulism were apparent among white, but
not black participants. The association between severe peri-
odontitis and total cancer risk was stronger in men (HR ¼ 1.41,
95% CI ¼ 1.16 to 1.72) and null in women (HR ¼ 1.03, 95% CI ¼
0.81
to
1.31)
compared
with
no/mild
periodontitis
(Supplementary Table 2, available online). In contrast, no statis-
tically significant associations were noted when using the peri-
odontitis
(CDC-AAP)
definition
(note,
edentulism
was
not
associated with risk when using the periodontitis [CDC-AAP]
definition as the reference category is different).
Total cancer mortality was also elevated among those with
severe periodontitis (HR ¼ 1.52, 95% CI ¼ 1.17 to 1.97, Ptrend ¼
.002) or with edentulism (HR ¼ 1.64, 95% CI ¼ 1.25 to 2.16) when
using the periodontitis ARIC definition (findings were also ele-
vated, but slightly weaker, when using periodontitis [CDC-AAP])
(Supplementary Table 3, available online); associations were
only apparent among white participants. Tests for multiplica-
tive interaction between edentulism and race were statistically
significant for both cancer incidence (Pinteraction ¼ .03 for both
periodontitis
definitions)
and
mortality
(periodontitis
[CDC-AAP], Pinteraction ¼ .02; periodontitis ARIC, Pinteraction ¼ .09).
Elevated associations for periodontitis and total cancer death
were only observed among men (Supplementary Table 4, avail-
able online).
Among never smokers, associations for periodontitis and to-
tal cancer risk were similar to those observed in the overall
study population, albeit weaker and not statistically significant
(Table 5). However, the risk associated with edentulism was
slightly stronger among never smokers (HR ¼ 1.34, 95% CI ¼ 1.01
to 1.77), especially among white participants. Results for mortal-
ity were similar to those for incidence and were primarily pre-
sent for white participants, as observed in the overall study
population (Supplementary Table 5, available online). Among
never smokers, tests for multiplicative interaction between
edentulism and race were statistically significant for cancer in-
cidence (Pinteraction ¼ .04) and mortality (Pinteraction ¼ .01) when
using no periodontitis as the reference (periodontitis [CDC-
AAP]).
Using either periodontitis definition, severe periodontal dis-
ease and edentulism were both associated with a greater than

*Participants attended visit 4 and were free of cancer at visit 4. Those who were not edentulous were categorized by periodontitis. ARIC ¼ Atherosclerosis Risk in
Communities; BMI ¼ body mass index; CDC-AAP ¼ US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention–American Academy of Periodontology; HRT ¼ hormone replacement
therapy.
†Third molars are excluded. Attachment loss (AL) and pocket depth (PD) measures at the four interproximal sites per tooth are included. No, no evidence of mild, mod-
erate, or severe periodontitis. Mild, two or more interproximal sites with AL � 3 mm, and two or more interproximal sites with PD � 4 mm (not on same tooth) or one
site with PD � 5 mm. Moderate, two or more interproximal sites with AL � 4 mm (not on same tooth), or two or more interproximal sites with PD � 5 mm (not on same
tooth). Severe, two or more interproximal sites with AL � 6 mm (not on same tooth) and one or more interproximal sites with PD � 5 mm.
‡AL measures at six sites per tooth are included. No/mild, less than 10% of examined sites having AL � 3 mm. Moderate, 10% or more and less than 30% of examined
sites having AL � 3 mm. Severe, 30% or more of examined sites having AL � 3 mm.

 twofold higher risk of lung cancer, with strong dose-response
relationships (HR ¼ 2.33, 95% CI ¼ 1.51 to 3.60, Ptrend < .001 [ARIC
definition]), even after adjusting for cigarette smoking status
and pack-years of smoking (Table 4); associations were only
present among white participants and were substantially stron-
ger among men than women (Supplementary Table 2, available
online). Severe periodontitis (periodontitis [CDC-AAP]) was as-
sociated with a statistically significant fourfold risk of lung can-
cer in never smokers (Table 5), based on 18 cases. Elevated risks
for smoking-related cancers were also observed in the overall
study population (Table 4), but not among never smokers
(Table 5).
For colorectal cancer, a statistically significant 80% increase
in risk was noted for edentulism, and a statistically nonsignifi-
cant 50% increase in risk was observed for severe periodontitis
when using either periodontal disease definition (Table 4). The
associations for colorectal cancer were also similar by sex
(Supplementary Table 2, available online). Among never smok-
ers, associations of severe periodontitis and edentulism with
colorectal cancer were stronger than in the overall study popu-
lation (HR ¼ 2.12, 95% CI ¼ 1.00 to 4.47), and these associations
appeared to be present in both white and black participants
(Table 5). When combined across all orodigestive cancers, pat-
terns were similar to those for colorectal cancer (54% of orodi-
gestive cancer cases), including a strong association between
edentulism
in
never
smokers
when
using
periodontitis
(ARIC; HR ¼ 2.26, 95% CI ¼ 1.28 to 3.99). Although there were
only 48 pancreatic cancers in this analysis and associations
were not statistically significant, we observed a higher risk
among participants with severe periodontitis compared with
no/mild periodontitis (multivariable HR ¼ 1.65, 95% CI ¼ 0.72 to
3.77, using periodontitis [ARIC]), consistent with prior studies;
the association was stronger among whites (HR ¼ 2.73, 95% CI ¼
0.97 to 7.66).
No associations were observed for breast (women), prostate,
or hematopoietic and lymphatic cancer risk (Table 4).
Given that diabetes is associated with periodontal disease in
the United States, we repeated the analysis excluding partici-
pants with a diabetes history at visit 4 (Supplementary Table 6,
available online); results were similar to the main analyses.
We stratified by body mass index, given the potential for an
interaction based on the combined effect of elevated systemic
inflammation from both conditions. In the overall study popula-
tion, the associations for severe periodontitis/edentulism and
total cancer risk were similarly elevated for normal and over-
weight individuals, and were slightly stronger among obese par-
ticipants (Supplementary Table 7, available online).
In sensitivity analysis, competing risks did not explain the
positive associations of periodontal disease and edentulism
with risk of total cancer incidence and mortality. In a second
sensitivity analysis, further adjusting for lifecourse SES only
modestly impacted associations for total cancer incidence and
mortality, and no multiplicative interactions were observed. For
example, strong associations observed between severe peri-
odontitis and lung cancer risk were not attenuated adjusting for
lifecourse SES (HR ¼ 2.36, 95% CI ¼ 1.40 to 3.98, for severe peri-
odontitis vs no periodontitis [periodontitis CDC-AAP]).
Discussion
In this study with measures of periodontal disease from a clin-
ical dental examination conducted as part of a cohort study
protocol, we observed a 24% higher risk of incident first pri-
mary cancer in participants with severe periodontitis and a
28% higher risk among those who reported being edentulous
at baseline, compared with those with no or mild periodonti-
tis. The highest increase in risk was observed for lung cancer,
followed by colorectal cancer. Associations were stronger
among white than black participants, with the exception of co-
lorectal cancer, where associations were consistent in both
groups.
ARIC is a unique population in which to examine the link be-
tween periodontal disease and cancer given the standardized
dental measurements conducted on a large number of partici-
pants. Some previous studies used crude measures of periodon-
tal disease, such as tooth loss or self-reported periodontal
disease (7), raising the possibility that the underlying associa-
tions may be stronger than observed given that such measure-
ment
error
typically
attenuates
associations.
For
clinical
practice, the AAP and American Dental Association use differ-
ent definitions to classify periodontal disease. Moreover, the
clinical parameters for diagnosis are technique sensitive, such
that diagnoses often vary among dentists. Consequently, to
standardize definitions and increase comparability across re-
search studies, population-based investigators have provided
guidelines on how to classify periodontitis without use of radio-
graph data on bone loss (17). In this study, we used the CDC-
AAP definition as well as a definition previously used in ARIC to
classify periodontitis severity using only attachment loss. The
CDC-AAP definition is based on measurements at four sites per
tooth, while the ARIC definition is based on measurements at
six sites per tooth. In addition, the ARIC definition takes into
consideration the extent of periodontal disease present (local-
ized vs generalized), as compared with the CDC-AAP definition,
where the focus is on severity of disease based on increasing

 level of attachment loss and probing depth. We observed some
differences in the associations with cancer risk when using
these two definitions, highlighting the need to better under-
stand how different definitions reflect underlying biological
mechanisms and their associations with unmeasured con-
founders or different extents of residual confounding by known
risk factors. Interestingly, associations observed for overall can-
cer death were more similar using the two definitions than for
overall incident cancer.
We included participants who self-reported being edentu-
lous as a separate category in the analysis because we could not
determine whether the cause was periodontal disease. In the
United States, periodontitis is the major cause of edentulism,
and loss of all teeth due to periodontitis is reflective of the most
severe state. However, even though edentulism is often the re-
sult of severe periodontitis, individuals may lose teeth due to
cavities and poor dental health. Thus tooth loss may not be a di-
rect marker of periodontitis. Therefore, it is plausible that the
associations we observed with edentulism are due to factors
unrelated to periodontitis, such as access to dental care.
Nevertheless, the findings for edentulism are consistent with
the findings for severe periodontitis, suggesting that the in-
creased risk is likely to be due, at least in part, to severe peri-
odontitis that resulted in tooth loss. Furthermore, we previously
reported that tooth loss during follow-up is strongly associated
with severe periodontitis in the ARIC study (21).
Studies on periodontal disease and cancer risk were recently
summarized in a review (7). Despite limitations in methodology
for periodontal disease assessment and classification in exist-
ing population-based studies, our results for severe periodonti-
tis and edentulism are consistent with published data. For
example, previous studies examining the relation between
periodontitis using a variety of measurements and lung cancer
risk all point to elevated risk adjusting for smoking (meta-analy-
sis, relative risk [RR] ¼ 1.33, 95% CI ¼ 1.19 to 1.49 [7]; and cohort
study published after the meta-analysis, RR ¼ 1.31, 95% CI ¼
1.14 to 1.51 [3]). Our finding is also consistent with the associa-
tion reported in the most recent meta-analysis for periodontal
disease and colorectal cancer risk (RR ¼ 1.49, 95% CI ¼ 0.95 to
2.29) (7). Similarly, published studies have not reported positive
associations between periodontal disease and prostate cancer
(1), but have been less consistent for breast cancer (3,22). Aside
from colorectal cancer, the number of other orodigestive can-
cers was too few to examine individually, and the overall group-
ing may have contributed to weaker findings; previous studies
have reported consistent positive associations for pancreatic
and oral cancer risk (7). Our finding for pancreatic cancer risk
was also similar to previous reports, although the confidence
interval was wide.
Black participants comprised 27.0% of the cohort, and thus
gave us the ability to investigate periodontal disease and cancer
risk separately among white and black participants. To our
knowledge, our study is the first to examine these associations
in persons who are black. Surprisingly, periodontitis and
edentulism were not associated with cancer risk among black
participants, with the exception of colorectal cancer, which was
positively associated (albeit not statistically significant) in both
racial groups. Future studies should examine these associations
in larger black populations.
Strengths of this study include the prospective design, the
dental examination to assess periodontitis measures, the ap-
proximate 15-year follow-up since the dental examination, the
validity of the cancer outcomes measures, and the conduct of
analyses to reduce confounding by smoking and diabetes. We

 documented that these associations were not due to competing
risks or confounding by lifecourse SES. The main limitation is
the size of the study population (n ¼ 7466), given that the dental
examination took place at visit 4 (about nine years into ARIC
follow-up). Similarly, as with any exposure assessment, mea-
surement and classification of periodontal disease may be im-
perfect, even when based on a clinical dental examination
performed as part of the cohort protocol. Given that the exami-
nation predated the diagnosis of cancer, we expect that the any
mismeasurement of periodontal disease would produce an un-
derestimate of the association. Finally, even though adjustment
for smoking dose and duration was made, we cannot rule out
confounding by smoking, especially for lung cancer. Given these
limitations, we interpret the results from this hypothesis-
driven study in the context of existing data; there is both consis-
tency in results among studies on periodontal disease and
cancer risk, and strong biological plausibility as it relates to in-
flammation and oral pathogens. For example, in animal models,
periodontal pathogens have been shown to increase tumor bur-
den in the colon and oral cavity (23,24); different mechanisms
have been proposed, including an increase in the proinflam-
matory
microenvironment
through
recruitment
of
tumor-
infiltrating immune cells (24), modulation of E-cadherin/beta-
catenin signaling via FadA adhesin (25), and inhibition of
natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity (26).
This study is one of the largest conducted to date on periodonti-
tis and cancer risk using a clinical dental examination performed
with standardized techniques as part of the cohort study protocol,
rather than self-reported periodontal disease or tooth loss, used in
previously studies. Prevalence of major cancer risk factors and can-
cer incidence and mortality rates in ARIC are similar to those
within the same age, race, and sex groups in the United States over
the same time period (18); thus we expect our findings, if causal, to
be generalizable to similar groups in the United States.
In summary, results from this study provide additional evi-
dence that increasing severity of periodontal disease is associ-
ated with cancer risk, including in never smokers, and suggest
that strong associations may exist for lung cancer. Future stud-
ies should evaluate and report periodontitis using clinical den-
tal measurements whenever possible and consider different
classification of periodontal disease severity. Additional re-
search, both observational and experimental, is needed to eval-
uate whether periodontal disease prevention and treatment can
alleviate cancer burden.

*Never smokers attended visit 4 and were free of cancer at visit 4. Those who were not edentulous were categorized by periodontitis. Cancers are first primary. ARIC ¼
Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities; BMI ¼ body mass index; CDC-AAP ¼ US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention–American Academy of Periodontology; CI ¼
confidence interval; HR ¼ hazard ratio; HRT ¼ hormone replacement therapy.
†All models are adjusted for age, field center, education level, drinking status, BMI, and diabetes status (diagnosed diabetes, undiagnosed diabetes, at risk for diabetes
[reference is normal]). Breast cancer models are additionally adjusted for HRT use. Models for total cancer, colorectal cancer, orodigestive cancer, smoking-related can-
cers, lung and bronchus cancer, and hematopoietic and lymphatic cancer are additionally adjusted for joint terms for sex and HRT use (female nonuser, female user
[reference is men]).
‡Overall model is additionally adjusted for joint terms for field center and race (black from Jackson; black from any of the other field centers; white from Forsyth
County or Washington County [reference is white from Minneapolis]) in place of field center.
§Third molars are excluded. Attachment loss (AL) and pocket depth (PD) measures at the four interproximal sites per tooth are included. No, no evidence of mild, mod-
erate, or severe periodontitis. Mild, two or more interproximal sites with AL � 3 mm, and two or more interproximal sites with PD � 4 mm (not on same tooth) or one
site with PD � 5 mm. Moderate, two or more interproximal sites with AL � 4 mm (not on same tooth), or two or more interproximal sites with PD � 5 mm (not on same
tooth). Severe, two or more interproximal sites with AL � 6 mm (not on same tooth) and one or more interproximal sites with PD � 5 mm.
kAL measures at six sites per tooth are included. No/mild, less than 10% of examined sites having AL � 3 mm. Moderate, 10% or more and less than 30% of examined
sites having AL � 3 mm. Severe, 30% or more of examined sites having AL � 3 mm.
