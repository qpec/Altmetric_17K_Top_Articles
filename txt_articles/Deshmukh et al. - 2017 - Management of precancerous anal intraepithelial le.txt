BACKGROUND: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)–positive men who have sex with men (MSM) are at disproportionately high risk
for anal cancer. There is no definitive approach to the management of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL), which are
precursors of anal cancer, and evidence suggests that posttreatment adjuvant quadrivalent human papillomavirus (qHPV) vaccination
improves HSIL treatment effectiveness. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the optimal HSIL management strategy with
respect to clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness and to identify the optimal age for initiating HSIL management. METHODS: A
decision analytic model of the natural history of anal carcinoma and HSIL management strategies was constructed for HIV-positive
MSM who were 27 years old or older. The model was informed by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results–Medicare database
and published studies. Outcomes included the lifetime cost, life expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy, cumulative risk of can-
cer and cancer-related deaths, and cost-effectiveness from a societal perspective. RESULTS: Active monitoring was the most effec-
tive approach in patients 29 years or younger; thereafter, HSIL treatment plus adjuvant qHPV vaccination became most effective.
When cost-effectiveness was considered (ie, an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio [ICER] < $100,000/quality-adjusted life-year),
do nothing was cost-effective until the age of 38 years, and HSIL treatment plus adjuvant qHPV vaccination was cost-effective
beyond the age of 38 years (95% confidence interval, 34-43 years). The ICER decreased as the age at HSIL management increased.
Outcomes were sensitive to the rate of HSIL regression or progression and the cost of high-resolution anoscopy and biopsy. CON-
CLUSIONS: The management of HSIL in HIV-positive MSM who are 38 years old or older with treatment plus adjuvant qHPV vaccina-
tion is likely to be cost-effective. The conservative approach of no treatment is likely to be cost-effective in younger patients. Cancer

INTRODUCTION
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)–positive men who have sex with men (MSM) are at disproportionately high risk
for anal cancer. The incidence of anal cancer in HIV-positive MSM is approximately 80 times higher than the incidence
in men from the rest of the general population.1-3 A persistent infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) has been asso-
ciated with the development of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL), which is a precursor of anal cancer.4
The incidence of HSIL among HIV-positive MSM (12.8 cases per 1000 person-months in 2011) increased by 12%
between 2000 and 2009,5-9 and the prevalence of HSIL among HIV-positive MSM is almost 50%.10-13
HSIL treatment is likely to prevent progression to invasive cancer14; however, the best management of these lesions
remains highly controversial.15-17 In recent years, high-resolution anoscopy (HRA)–directed ablation with a laser,

 cryotherapy, an infrared coagulator, or electrocautery has
been evolving into a standard approach for the manage-
ment of HSIL.18-21 Studies have shown that ablation is
more effective than no treatment in clearing HSIL; how-
ever, the rate of HSIL recurrence after the initial treatment
is extremely high, with approximately 60% to 70% of
HIV-positive MSM experiencing recurrence within 1 year
of treatment.19,21-23 The risk of recurrence increases with
each additional lesion treated,14 and despite treatment and
routine follow-up, patients are at risk of progressing to
cancer.14,23 An alternative potential approach to managing
HSIL is ablative treatment along with adjuvant quadriva-
lent human papillomavirus (qHPV) vaccination (ie, vacci-
nation after treatment for HSIL). Recent studies suggest
that posttreatment adjuvant qHPV vaccination improves
treatment effectiveness by decreasing the risk of HSIL
recurrence by approximately 50%, and it is cost-saving in
comparison with treatment alone.24-26
If not treated, HSIL can naturally regress.27 Some
suggest that HSIL treatment should be delayed and that
patients should be followed until the development of anal
cancer because patients, in addition to having frequent
recurrences, may experience postoperative complications
such as anal stenosis and fecal incontinence; thus, the risk
of HSIL treatment may outweigh the benefit.16,17 This
approach to HSIL management is known as active moni-
toring or watchful waiting17,28 and consists of periodically
performing digital anorectal examination (DARE) and
HRA for the early detection of anal cancer and biopsying
visible lesions.
In this study, our first objective was to find the opti-
mal strategy for managing HSIL in HIV-positive MSM
with respect to clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness
of the following approaches: do nothing, active monitor-
ing, HSIL treatment alone, and HSIL treatment plus
adjuvant qHPV vaccination. Our second objective was to
identify the optimal age for initiating HSIL management.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
We developed a Markov-based state-transition model to
simulate the clinical course of HIV-positive MSM diag-
nosed with HSIL. The model was developed from a US
societal perspective over the time horizon of patients’ life-
times using annual cycles. For a detailed model descrip-
tion, see section A in the online supporting information.
Baseline Population
The baseline population consisted of a cohort of HIV-
positive MSM (median age, 40 years; range, 27-60 years)
with a first-time HSIL diagnosis in the United States. The
base-case age of 40 years was chosen because the median
age at HSIL diagnosis in prior studies was 40 years.22,29,30
We categorized patients according to their CD4 cell count
distribution (ie, >500, 200-500, or <200).
Comparators for Clinical and Economic
Evaluations
Do nothing
Given that there is no uniform standard of care for HSIL,
we simulated a do-nothing strategy as one potential
option. The rationale for including this option was that
not all patients progress to anal cancer, and progression
can take several years; therefore, it might be reasonable to
delay treatment until patients develop anal cancer. The
diagnosis of invasive cancer was based on symptoms (typi-
cally bleeding, an anal mass, or anal pain), and the distri-
bution of the stages of diagnosis was based on the
Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data-
base.31,32 These patients subsequently would receive treat-
ment for invasive cancer.
Active monitoring or watchful waiting
An alternative strategy is active monitoring or watchful
waiting. We simulated active monitoring of patients with
DARE and HRA-guided biopsy for the early detection of
cancer.28 Patients could progress to invasive cancer, and
their stage of diagnosis was based on the work of Berry
et al.33 These patients subsequently would receive treat-
ment for cancer.
Treatment for HSIL
The third strategy was defined as the immediate treatment
of HSIL. After the initial diagnosis and treatment, these
patients were monitored annually with DARE and HRA
for the subsequent risk of HSIL recurrence or cancer.
Long-term HSIL treatment effectiveness data in terms of
the risk of recurrence after treatment for initial and subse-
quent HSIL were obtained from the literature (Support-
ing Table A.3 [see online supporting information]).14,21-
23 We also incorporated loss to follow-up during the
annual screening and treatment for subsequent lesions.22
Patients lost during follow-up were at risk of progressing
to anal cancer.
Treatment plus adjuvant qHPV vaccination
Finally, we simulated the long-term effectiveness of pro-
viding HSIL treatment plus adjuvant qHPV vaccination.
Patients who receive adjuvant qHPV vaccination are less
likely to experience HSIL recurrence.26 Vaccine effective-
ness data were obtained from the literature (Supporting
Table A.3 [see online supporting information]).24-26

 A detailed description of all comparators and clinical data
is included in section A in the online supporting
information.
Natural History and Health-State Transitions
Disease transitions occurred at 2 levels: 1) within health
states for HIV and 2) within health states for anal disease.
Anal carcinogenesis (ie, the probability of anal disease pro-
gression or regression) was conditional on the receipt of
the form of care for HSIL, the patient’s HIV status, and
the receipt of antiretroviral therapy.
Disease progression from HSIL to anal cancer in
patients who were not receiving treatment for HSIL or
were actively being monitored was calibrated using a sepa-
rate natural-history model of anal carcinogenesis that used
the age-specific incidence of anal cancer in HIV-positive
MSM (see section B in the online supporting informa-
tion) as a calibration target. For patients receiving treat-
ment for HSIL and subsequent HSIL recurrences, disease
progression to invasive cancer was based on an estimation
by Pineda et al.23 HSIL regression data were obtained
from the literature.27 Because natural-history data on dis-
ease progression after natural regression were not avail-
able, we used the available data on the initial disease
transition (Supporting Table A.2 [see online supporting
information]).5,34,35 Patients during their lifetime might
die of HIV-related illness, anal cancer, or other unrelated
causes.32,36
Costs and Health-Related Quality of Life
Our model included the costs of HIV-related care (by
CD4 count), anal cancer treatment (by stage), HSIL treat-
ment, HRA and biopsy, and adjuvant qHPV vaccination
(Supporting Table A.4 [see online supporting informa-
tion]).32,37-39 We converted all costs to 2016 US dollars
using consumer price indices for medical care.40
To account for the differential quality of life in dif-
ferent health states, we assigned health-related quality-of-
life weights (utilities) to each health state using published
data. Utilities were assigned on the basis of the HIV status,
anal disease status, and age.34,41
Analysis and Model Outcomes
We followed the recommendations of the US Panel on
Cost-Effectiveness in Health and Medicine for conduct-
ing our analysis.42 For each strategy, we simulated the life
expectancy, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and total
lifetime cost. Future costs and QALYs were reported in
terms of the net present value with an annual discount
rate of 3%.43 We presented outcomes for all HIV-positive
MSM as well as the subgroups stratified by the patient
HIV status. A comparative assessment was conducted,
and the results were presented in the form of incremental
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), decreases in the lifetime
risk of anal cancer, and decreases in the lifetime anal can-
cer mortality risk. To determine the cost-effectiveness of
strategies by age, we estimated outcomes by the age at the
initiation of HSIL management, starting from age 27
onwards. We used the commonly recommended societal
willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000/QALY to deter-
mine the cost-effectiveness of strategies.44
We performed comprehensive sensitivity analyses of
all model parameters to evaluate the robustness of the out-
comes. Deterministic (1-way and 2-way) sensitivity analy-
ses were conducted by varying input model parameters.
Finally, a probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted
to assess decision uncertainty, and the outcomes were pre-
sented using cost-effectiveness acceptability curves.
RESULTS
Model Validation
We cross-validated our model by comparing our cali-
brated rates of progression from HSIL to anal cancer with
those reported in previously published studies.34,45,46 The
model-calibrated HSIL–to–anal cancer progression rate
was within the plausible range of the reported progression
and followed a similar trend (ie, the rate of progression
increased with increasing age).
We also compared the model-predicted cumulative
risk of HSIL to the cumulative risk reported by Burgos
et al.47 The predicted natural-history HSIL risk was
within the 95% confidence intervals of the reported risk.
For detailed model validation, see section C in the online
supporting information.
Clinical Outcomes
For 40-year-old HIV-positive MSM, compared with do
nothing, treatment decreased the lifetime incidence of
anal cancer and mortality by 66%, and treatment plus
adjuvant qHPV vaccination decreased the lifetime inci-
dence and mortality by 80% (Fig. 1A,B). Active moni-
toring did not reduce the cumulative incidence of anal
cancer; however, early detection attributed to active
monitoring could decrease the lifetime mortality risk by
6%.
We further evaluated the influence of age on the
optimal HSIL management strategy. We found that active
monitoring was the most effective HSIL management
strategy in patients up to the age of 29 years (ie, it was
associated
with

 expectancy; Fig. 2A,B). From the age of 30 years onward,
the combination of treatment and qHPV vaccination was
the most effective strategy.
Cost-Effectiveness Analysis
For 40-year-old HIV-positive MSM, treatment plus adju-
vant qHPV vaccination was the most cost-effective strat-
egy with a resulting ICER of $73,367/QALY (Table 1).
Active monitoring and treatment for HSIL were domi-
nated by the treatment plus adjuvant qHPV vaccination
strategy and were eliminated.48
When we estimated the cost-effectiveness by age, we
found that treatment plus adjuvant qHPV vaccination
was cost-effective in patients 38 years old or older (95%
confidence interval, 34-43 years; Fig. 3). In patients who
were 37 years old or younger, do nothing was cost-
effective.
Sensitivity Analysis
To evaluate the sensitivity of the results to age, we identi-
fied the top 15 model parameters in the order of their
impact on the minimum age at which treatment plus
adjuvant qHPV vaccination became cost-effective (Fig.
4A) and the base-case ICER (Fig. 4B). The outcomes
were most sensitive to HSIL progression and regression in
untreated patients. When the age-adjusted HSIL–to–anal
cancer progression was 0.01 (base case, 0.0035 or 1 of 286
per year), the management of HSIL with treatment plus
qHPV vaccination was cost-effective, regardless of the age
of the patients. Similarly, when the age-adjusted HSIL

 regression was 10% (base case, 15%), then treatment plus
qHPV vaccination became cost-effective at the age of 31
years. The base-case ICERs for these values were $42,054/
QALY and $49,616/QALY, respectively.
The ICER was not sensitive to HSIL treatment
effectiveness and vaccine efficacy because it did not exceed
$100,000/QALY even when a high recurrence rate and
worst-case adjuvant qHPV vaccination efficacy were
assumed (Supporting Table D.1 [see online supporting
information]). An additional 1-way sensitivity analysis of
natural-history and cost parameters is presented in Sup-
porting Table D.2 (see online supporting information).
The ICER changed marginally for the subgroups of
patients presenting with CD4 cell count distributions of
>500, 200 to 500, and <200. For all subgroups, treat-
ment plus adjuvant qHPV vaccination remained cost-
effective.
A 2-way sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the
cost-effective strategy changed with the change in HSIL–
to–anal cancer progression in untreated (base case,
0.0035) and treated patients (base case, 0.0012; Support-
ing Fig. D.1 [see online supporting information]). For
example, when the values for HSIL–to–anal cancer pro-
gression in untreated and treated patients were 0.001 and
0.003, respectively, do nothing was cost-effective.
The probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that in
40-year-old HIV-positive MSM, adjuvant qHPV vaccina-
tion was cost-effective with a 73% probability at the
threshold of $100,000/QALY; alternatively, do nothing
was cost-effective with a 27% probability (Supporting
Fig. D.2 [see online supporting information]). In HIV-
positive MSM at the ages of 30, 50, and 60 years, the
probabilities that HSIL treatment plus adjuvant qHPV
vaccination would be cost-effective were 18%, 99.5%,
and 100%, respectively (Supporting Fig. D.3 [see online
supporting information]).
DISCUSSION
Our comparative analysis of clinical effectiveness and
cost-effectiveness shows that active monitoring without
treatment until invasive cancer is identified is likely to be
the most effective HSIL management strategy for HIV-
positive MSM who are 29 years old or younger. In
patients who are 30 years old or older, treatment plus
adjuvant qHPV vaccination is potentially most effective.
However, considering the cost-effectiveness of interven-
tions, we found that do nothing is likely to be cost-
effective until the age of 38 years, and HSIL treatment
along with adjuvant qHPV vaccination is potentially most
cost-effective in patients aged 38 years (95% confidence
interval, 34-43 years) or older with the commonly used
willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000/QALY. It is
neither effective nor cost-effective to treat patients who
are 29 years old or younger because of their lower likeli-
hood of developing anal cancer and the higher likelihood
of natural regression of HSIL among younger patients.
This finding is consistent with the rationale that the inci-
dence of anal cancer increases with increased age3,49;
therefore, the benefits of treatment might be higher in
older patients.
In a manner similar to cervical disease in women,
the regression of anal HSIL has been shown to be associ-
ated with age. Tong et al27,50 found that among HIV-
positive MSM, the regression rate was significantly lower
in men older than 35 years versus those younger than 35
years (P 5 .048). Thus, the findings from our study sup-
port a conservative approach of active monitoring in men
younger than 35 years, and they would represent an
approach comparable to the management of cervical
HSIL among young immunocompetent women.51,52 For
immunocompetent women between the ages of 21 and 25
years, minimum evaluation and management of abnormal
cervical cytology are recommended.51,52 Our findings
could inform the development of similar guidelines for
anal HSIL management for preventing overtreatment in
younger HIV-positive MSM.
Unlike the management of cervical HSIL, in which
cervical abnormalities detected by regular screening can
be effectively managed with procedures such as the loop
electrosurgery excision procedure,53 complete ablative
management of anal HSIL is difficult and is associated

 with a high rate of recurrence and a higher likelihood of
adverse events.22,54 Therefore, regular anal cytology–
based screening protocols for the detection of these lesions
would be unreasonable without the identification of a
definitive and cost-effective management strategy for
HSIL.11,54-56
Surgical and ablative anal HSIL therapies are not
without significant risk. They can be associated not only
with additional cost but also with temporary morbidity,
including pain, rectal bleeding, and discharge. Long-term
complications are rare but can include anal stenosis, fistula
and fissure formation, and discomfort with alterations in
sexual satisfaction. Therefore, before treatment is recom-
mended, it is crucial for clinicians to consider the risk of
progression to invasive cancer, the treatment duration,
treatment-related adverse effects, the likelihood that a
patient will comply with and adhere to treatment for sub-
sequent lesions, the patient’s preference, and the cost of
care.
There are several obstacles to developing HSIL man-
agement guidelines. For example, compared with cervical
colposcopy, HRA along with HSIL management is diffi-
cult and involves challenges such as uneven topography
and the obscuring of lesions due to anal warts, hemor-
rhoids, folds, stool, or muscle; lesions may also be located
at the base of folds and anal glands.57 Thus, to adequately
screen for and manage HSIL lesions, clinicians often need
additional training above and beyond that training speci-
fied by even subspecialty medical boards. Our analysis
suggests that treating HSIL in HIV-positive MSM is cost-
effective; however, at this time, the number of clinicians
with adequate experience for diagnosing and managing
HSIL in HIV-positive individuals in the United States
remains inadequate. Therefore, it is imperative to make
educational efforts to train clinicians in the requisite
procedures.
The National Cancer Institute–supported AIDS
Malignancy Consortium has recently launched a phase 3
clinical trial (Anal Cancer/HSIL Outcomes Research
[ANCHOR]) to compare the outcomes of active moni-
toring via regular examinations and treatment for HSIL.
The ANCHOR study will hopefully fill in some of the
gaps related to the natural history of HSIL in HIV-
infected individuals; however, ensuring cost-effective
approaches during the implementation of HSIL screening
and
management
recommendations
and
guidelines
remains of the utmost importance in this day and age of
rising health care costs.
Our study is not without limitations. The data,
including the effectiveness of HSIL treatment, the
effectiveness of adjuvant qHPV vaccination, and the natu-
ral history of HSIL, though representing the best available
evidence, were obtained from studies that were not ran-
domized and did not directly compare the HSIL manage-
ment
strategies.
We
addressed
this
limitation
by
conducting an extensive sensitivity analysis in which we
found that the ICER and the optimal age when treatment
plus vaccination becomes effective or cost-effective were
most sensitive to HSIL–to–anal cancer progression and
HSIL regression among untreated patients. Although
observational studies and the Study of Prevention of Anal
Cancer Trial have reported HSIL regression,27,58 the
HSIL–to–anal cancer progression rate remains unob-
served. Because the outcomes were most sensitive to the
HSIL progression rate, which remains the area of greatest
uncertainty, our findings should be interpreted within the
context of this limitation. Furthermore, in our model cali-
bration, we found that the progression is likely to increase
with increasing age. Future research should prioritize the
assessment of age-specific HSIL progression and regres-
sion, which remain the area of greatest uncertainty.
Finally, the objective of our study was to estimate cost-
effectiveness for the US health care system. According to
the costs of HSIL care, anal cancer care, and HIV care and
according to the outcomes (eg, recurrence rate and sur-
vival), the cost-effectiveness will vary for other health care
systems
(eg,
Canada,
the
United
Kingdom,
and
Australia).
The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practi-
ces of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention rec-
ommends HPV vaccination for the primary prevention of
anal cancer in males aged 11 to 26 years. HPV vaccination
is not licensed for males older than 26 years. No data on
HPV vaccination efficacy exist for primary prevention in
males older than 26 years. We considered posttreatment
adjuvant qHPV vaccination as a comparator in these men.
This is because there are early data suggesting that men
older than 26 years with anal HSIL may have a decreased
risk of HSIL recurrence when they are given an adjuvant
qHPV vaccine at the time of their HSIL treatment with-
out the addition of any side effects. Others have reported
similar evidence for decreasing rates of recurrent cervical
intraepithelial neoplasia, vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia,
and respiratory and laryngeal papillomatosis.59-66 Post-
treatment adjuvant vaccination is not completely accepted
in clinical practice because of the lack of randomized clini-
cal trial data. Furthermore, it is not understood whether
the vaccine prevents the recurrence of the initially treated
lesion or halts new HSIL development. Because of these
uncertainties, it might be several more years before data

 from randomized clinical trials inform this practice for
the prevention of anal cancer; however, the implementa-
tion of such a strategy sooner rather than later might pre-
sent an important cancer prevention opportunity.67
Finally, our results demonstrate that age can be used
as an important predictor for the determination of indi-
viduals who might benefit more from treatment versus
those who may not. Emerging data show that the persis-
tence of HPV-16 or any high-risk HPV might play a role
in the lack of HSIL clearance and subsequent progression
to anal cancer in HIV-infected individuals.58 As this asso-
ciation is established, age-specific risk-stratified outcomes
of HSIL management must be determined. Likewise,
smoking might play a role in the determination of an algo-
rithm for HSIL management.68 Therefore, the role of
smoking on anal cancer’s natural history and treatment
algorithms needs to be evaluated.
In conclusion, our study is the first to demonstrate
that younger HIV-positive MSM might benefit from a
conservative approach to HSIL management. Further-
more, posttreatment adjuvant qHPV vaccination is likely
to be the most cost-effective strategy for managing HSIL
in patients 38 years old or older. Future research needs to
prioritize determining the age-specific natural history of
anal cancer.
