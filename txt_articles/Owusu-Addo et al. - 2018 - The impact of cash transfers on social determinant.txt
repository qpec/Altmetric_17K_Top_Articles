Abstract
Cash transfers (CTs) are now high on the agenda of most governments in low- and middle-income
countries. Within the field of health promotion, CTs constitute a healthy public policy initiative as
they have the potential to address the social determinants of health (SDoH) and health inequalities.
A systematic review was conducted to synthesise the evidence on CTs’ impacts on SDoH and
health inequalities in sub-Saharan Africa, and to identify the barriers and facilitators of effective
CTs. Twenty-one electronic databases and the websites of 14 key organizations were searched in
addition to grey literature and hand searching of selected journals for quantitative and qualitative
studies on CTs’ impacts on SDoH and health outcomes. Out of 182 full texts screened for eligibility,
79 reports that reported findings from 53 studies were included in the final review. The studies
were undertaken within 24 CTs comprising 11 unconditional CTs (UCTs), 8 conditional CTs (CCTs)
and 5 combined UCTs and CCTs. The review found that CTs can be effective in tackling structural
determinants of health such as financial poverty, education, household resilience, child labour,
social capital and social cohesion, civic participation, and birth registration. The review further
found that CTs modify intermediate determinants such as nutrition, dietary diversity, child
deprivation, sexual risk behaviours, teen pregnancy and early marriage. In conjunction with their
influence on SDoH, there is moderate evidence from the review that CTs impact on health and
quality of life outcomes. The review also found many factors relating to intervention design
features,
macro-economic
stability,
household
dynamics
and
community
acceptance
of
programs that could influence the effectiveness of CTs. The external validity of the review
findings is strong as the findings are largely consistent with those from Latin America. The find-
ings thus provide useful insights to policy makers and managers and can be used to optimise
CTs to reduce health inequalities.

 Introduction
There is a large body of evidence indicating that tackling the social
determinants of health (SDoH) will lead to improved health out-
comes and a reduction in health disparities (Marmot et al. 2012). In
sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), disparities exist within and between
countries. Pro-poor strategies focused on poverty reduction, im-
proved education, living conditions, employment, social cohesion
and access to health services are key to improving health and ad-
dressing health inequalities in SSA (Munodawafa et al. 2013).
A promising and widely used intervention that could help in this dir-
ection is cash transfers (CTs).
CTs are generally targeted at poor households and seek to en-
courage increased demand for services through an ‘income effect’
(the change in consumption resulting from the cash payments) and
in the case of conditional cash transfers (CCTs), through both an in-
come effect and a ‘substitution effect’ (the opportunity cost associ-
ated with investing in children’s human capital). Garcia and Moore
(2012) have identified two types of CTs in SSA namely: middle-
income CTs and low-income and fragile CTs. The middle-income
CTs constitute social assistance transfers which are normally pro-
vided by government institutions and domestically funded, with oc-
casional donor support. These are directed to groups most in need
and have no definite end-date. Low-income and fragile CTs, how-
ever, frequently have a short time frame and intend to graduate ben-
eficiaries from the program. Low-income and fragile CTs are often
managed outside government institutions, are fully or partly funded
by donors, and typically target specific groups in need prioritized by
donor agencies.
CT programs in SSA can be CCTs or unconditional cash trans-
fers (UCTs). Both CCTs and UCTs are largely designed to transfer
cash to poor households and other vulnerable groups to stimulate a
change in behaviour. By their nature, CCTs are conditional upon
beneficiary households adopting certain positive behaviours, includ-
ing investment in children’s education, nutrition and health care
(Fiszbein and Schady 2009). CCTs thus constitute a kind of ‘social
contract’ that requires households to take steps to improve their
lives and that of their children. The key difference between CCTs
and UCTs is that the latter give cash to households with no condi-
tions attached (Baird et al. 2013a).
There are marked differences in the design and delivery of CTs
between SSA and other parts of the world, especially Latin America
where they have been widely used. CTs in SSA are distinguished by
their focus on extremely poor and labour-constrained households
(those who are unable to work, e.g. the aged and severely disabled)
as well as the ‘soft’ conditions, that is, no penalties for noncompli-
ance and low levels of monitoring due to the costs associated with
tracking and enforcement (Davis et al. 2012, 2016). The diverse
cultural contexts in SSA also play a key role in shaping their deliv-
ery, and the impact that CTs achieve. A high level of community in-
volvement is a feature of CTs in SSA where, in contrast to Latin
America, programs rely heavily on communities to help identify the
most vulnerable groups to receive the transfers (Garcia and Moore
2012). Similarly, the collectivist cultures in SSA (where people be-
long to ‘in groups’) may have implications for the effects that CTs
may achieve compared to their effects in individualistic cultural set-
tings. They can either strengthen or weaken social capital and intra-
community cohesion in collectivist cultures (Pavanello 2016).
Previous evaluations of CTs in SSA indicate that these programs
may influence the wider SDoH, yet there has been no attempt to syn-
thesise this evidence. Previous reviews of CT programs have largely
focused on impacts upon health service usage and health outcomes
(Lagarde et al. 2007; Lucas et al. 2008; Adato and Bassett 2009;
Gaarder et al. 2010; Boccia et al. 2011; Ranganathan and Lagarde
2012; Bassani et al. 2013; Glassman et al. 2013; Pega et al. 2013;
Owusu-Addo and Cross 2014), HIV (Pettifor et al. 2012; Heise
et al. 2013), nutrition (Leroy et al. 2009; Martins et al. 2013), and
other social outcomes such as education (Baird et al. 2013a) and
child labour (de Hoop and Rosati 2014). These reviews have given
little attention to the impact of CTs upon a wider range of health de-
terminants and their effect on health inequalities. Moreover, existing
reviews of the effect of CTs have relied heavily on evidence from
Latin America, with limited contextual and programmatic relevance
to SSA. Finally, none of the previous reviews have included qualita-
tive studies that have explored the programs’ impacts (including the
intended and unanticipated impacts), and of the process and mech-
anisms by which CTs influence SDoH. This systematic review aims
to address these gaps by synthesising quantitative and qualitative
evidence on the contribution of CTs in addressing the wider SDoH,
and their effects on h0ealth and health inequalities in SSA.
Methods
Details of the review methods have been published in the review
protocol (Owusu-Addo et al. 2016b), which was registered with
PROSPERO (registration number: CRD42015025015). The review
methods are summarised below.
Review framework and search strategy
The SDoH conceptual framework developed by WHO Commission
on SDoH (Commission on Social Determinants of Health 2008) was
used to identify the structural determinants of health (the social, eco-
nomic and political factors which generate and maintain socioeco-
nomic position) and intermediate determinants of health (factors
that mediate the effect of socioeconomic position on health
Key Messages
•
CTs have seen an exponential growth in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) in the last decade with corresponding strengthening
of evaluation, but there have been no systematic review of their impact on social determinants of health (SDoH) and
health inequalities.
•
Evidence from 53 studies covering 24 CTs indicate that CTs can tackle the SDoH in SSA.
•
CTs have moderate impact on health and nutritional outcomes and this calls for the provision of supplementary services
and behaviour change interventions to optimise their impact.
•
The review identified a range of factors that may facilitate or hinder the performance and effectiveness of CTs especially
the size of the transfer and irregularity of transfer payment.

 including material circumstances, psychosocial circumstances, be-
havioural factors and access to health care) which CTs could impact
to improve health.
Twenty-one electronic databases were searched and, in addition to
this, selected journals were hand searched. The websites of 14 organi-
zations known to be active in the field were searched as well as the on-
line resources of universities in Africa, to find technical reports,
working papers and other grey literature. Google Scholar and Scirus
Internet searches were also carried out. All relevant records were
downloaded into the review management software EPPI reviewer.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Both quantitative and qualitative research was considered. For
quantitative evidence, studies that investigated the effects of CTs
using experimental and quasi-experimental study designs were
included. Eligible qualitative studies comprised stand-alone investi-
gations of CTs’ impacts, including those reporting the perceptions of
beneficiaries and/or stakeholders, and those embedded in included
quantitative studies. We did not find any process evaluation studies
as we had planned in the protocol.
The population of focus in this review was those targeted by ei-
ther CCT or UCT programs. The review included CCTs and UCTs
which aimed to reduce poverty and/or vulnerability. CTs for assist-
ance in humanitarian disasters were excluded as they are often one-
time and address different causal pathways. Primary outcomes were
not specified a priori, and studies were included if they reported at
least one of the following: financial poverty, employment, educa-
tion, nutrition, empowerment, social cohesion or social capital,
child labour, civic participation, living conditions (e.g. housing) and
productive capital. The secondary outcomes examined were health
status and quality of life.
Selection of studies, data extraction and quality
assessment
One independent author screened the full reports to determine their
eligibility and in case of uncertainty, consulted a second author to
reach consensus on those to be included. The data extraction form
recommended by the Cochrane Public Health Group (Cochrane
Public Health Group 2011) was adapted for the extraction of data
from quantitative studies. The Joana Briggs Institute’s (JBI 2011)
data extraction form for qualitative studies was adapted for extract-
ing data from qualitative studies. Risk of bias in quantitative studies
was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias tool
while the Joana Briggs Institute’s Qualitative Assessment and
Review Instrument (JBI-QARI) was used to assess dependability of
qualitative studies (i.e. suitability of the methodology to answer re-
search questions and extent to which the methods align with the
chosen methodology). Included studies were quality assessed by two
independent reviewers with disagreements being resolved by a third
reviewer. The results of the quality assessment were used as part of
the criteria in rating the quality of evidence.
Data synthesis
A meta-analysis was not feasible due to the diversity of population
groups, outcomes and measurements, as well as the difficulty of ob-
taining additional information from authors. Narrative synthesis
was conducted following the approach recommended by Popay
et al. (2006). For each outcome domain, a vote count was conducted
to determine the number of studies reporting differing directions
and magnitudes of effect. We had anticipated that studies would re-
port the effects of CTs on health inequalities and we planned to use
harvest plots to visually summarise these. However, this was not
possible as we did not find any study which focussed on health
inequalities. We therefore provided a narrative account of CT’s po-
tential impact on health inequalities using the available sub-group
analyses results provided in the included studies. Thematic synthesis
of qualitative studies was carried out to combine the evidence using
the approach proposed by Thomas and Harden (2008). GRADE
was used to assess the quality of body of evidence from all quantita-
tive studies within each broad outcome domain. For qualitative
studies, the ConQual approach developed by Munn et al. (2014)
was used to assess the findings based on dependability and
credibility.
Results
Search results and study of types
The literature search yielded a total of 28 057 references of which
182 full-text reports were screened for eligibility. Seventy-nine re-
ports that present results from 53 studies were included in the final
review (Figure 1). The included reports comprised of journal articles
(41), technical reports (22), working papers (15) and a PhD thesis
(1). As shown in Table 1, of the 53 studies included in the review,
3 were randomized controlled trials (RCTs), 22 cluster–RCTs
(c-RCT), 8 were quasi-experiments and 20 were qualitative studies.
Supplementary Data S1 provides details of the characteristics of
included studies.
Context and description of CT interventions
The studies were undertaken within 24 CTs comprising of 11 UCTs,
8 CCTs and 5 combined UCTs and CCTs (Table 1). Of the 24 CTs,
13 were large-scale (government-led programs) while 11 were small-
scale (often pilot projects). Three each of the CTs were implemented
in Malawi, Uganda and Zambia; two each in Kenya, South Africa,
Tanzania and Zimbabwe; and one each in Burkina Faso, Congo,
Ghana, Lesotho, Mozambique, Niger and Nigeria. The CTs were
targeted at poor or labour constrained households with orphans or
vulnerable children within a specified age category and/or vulner-
able individuals such as people at risk of HIV/STIs, pregnant
women, the elderly or people with disability.
The transfer size and frequency of payment varied according to
the program. In the case of CCTs, the conditions included school at-
tendance, use of health services, use of nutrition services, registra-
tion for health insurance, HIV/STI prevention and birth registration.
These conditions were rarely monitored and therefore could be
described as ‘soft’ conditions with no punitive measures. In most of
the government-led CT programs, the community played a signifi-
cant role in targeting program beneficiaries either by compiling the
initial eligibility list (e.g. Ghana, Kenya, Malawi) or screening final
lists that had been compiled by program managers (e.g. Lesotho,
Zimbabwe). Further details of the CTs included in the review are
summarised in Supplementary Data S2.
Quality assessment
Risk of bias
Figure 2 presents a summary of risk of bias for each domain across
all quantitative studies. There was a low risk of selection bias in
most of the RCT/c-RCTs, with randomisation sequence generation
undertaken by lottery, computer generated numbers, tossing of coins
or block randomization methods. Allocation concealment was fur-
ther ensured by masking households or individuals at baseline in

 most studies. Most of the quasi-experimental studies used matching
techniques which ensured that covariates in treatment and control
groups were balanced and thus controlled for selection bias. There
was however a high risk of performance bias in the RCT/c-RCTs,
but it must be noted that the nature of CTs is such that it is very
often difficult to mask participants after allocation into the interven-
tion. There was also a high risk of detection bias as outcome asses-
sors and data analysts were largely unblinded in most studies. Other
risks of bias included the use of self-report measures rather than ob-
jective measures, which are subject to recall and other biases.
Quality appraisal of qualitative studies
Figure 3 presents a summary of the dependability of each included
qualitative study. The major dependability issues were epistemolo-
gical and methodological congruence as most of the studies did not
state their philosophical underpinnings. Similarly, none of the
included studies provided a description of reflexivity, a quality indi-
cator concerning how knowledge is constructed and the basis upon
which validity is determined. However, most studies had high de-
pendability in relation to appropriateness of methodology, data
collection methods, thick description and congruence between con-
clusions and findings.
Findings on SDoH
The included studies reported the impact of CTs on 12 domains of
SDoH. These are synthesized in Table 2 (quantitative findings) and in
Table 3 (qualitative findings), and in the text below. Details of program
effects (quantitative) are provided in Supplementary Data S3.
Financial poverty
Eight studies measured program impact on poverty headcount (measur-
ing the proportion of the population that is poor), poverty gap (measur-
ing the extent of poverty) and poverty severity (measuring inequality
among poor household) and found consistent evidence across five coun-
tries (Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Uganda and Zambia) indicating that
CTs reduce short-term poverty. For instance, in Zambia, the American
Institutes for Research’s (AIR) (2015a) study found that the MCTG
reduced poverty headcount by 9 percentage points (pp), poverty gap by
12 pp and poverty severity by 11 pp, while the CGP reduced poverty

 headcount, poverty gap and poverty severity by 10 pp, 10 pp and 8 pp,
respectively (AIR 2015b).
Nine studies reported program effects on total household con-
sumption in seven countries (Ghana, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi,
Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe). With the exception of the
Ghanaian program which had no impact on household consump-
tion, eight other programs significantly increased total household
consumption. Evidence from the nine studies further showed that
CT programs had significant increases in food expenditure. Ghana’s
program however, significantly increased household spending on
non-consumption items (e.g. school supplies such as books and
pens) rather than food (Handa et al. 2014b).
Findings from qualitative studies lend support to CTs’ impact in
reducing financial poverty. We identified eleven qualitative studies
which showed that despite differences in design, CTs contributed to
child poverty reduction by raising children’s consumption directly
(see Table 3). Other financial poverty related outcomes included re-
silience, productive capital and participation in non-farm enterprises
(NFE) which are further examined below.
Resilience
The majority of the programs were evaluated regarding their impacts
on household and individual resilience, conceptualised as the ability to
manage and withstand shocks. The indicators commonly used across
the studies were savings and borrowings and/or being out of debt.
Of six studies that examined seven CT programs’ impacts on
savings, five found significant increases in savings ranging from 3 to
24 pp (in Ghana, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia). There
was only limited qualitative evidence that Mozambique’s PSSB and
Uganda’s SCG improved beneficiaries’ saving practices (Bukuluki
and Watson 2012; Selvester et al. 2012).
The 10 studies that examined 11 CT programs’ impacts on bor-
rowing showed mixed results. The findings indicated that house-
holds either used CTs to pay off their debt or to increase their access
to credit. Two programs (Ghana’s LEAP and Zambia’s CGP) were
found to significantly reduce the original debt levels of beneficiary
households by 23.4 and 1.7 pp, respectively (Daidone et al. 2014a;
Handa et al. 2014b). Both Zambia’s MCTG and Zimbabwe’s HSCT
significantly reduced household’s exposure to debt (AIR 2014,
201a). Kenya’s HSNP significantly increased beneficiary house-
holds’ capacity to borrow by 9.7 pp (Merttens et al. 2013).
Seven qualitative studies (in Ghana, Lesotho, Kenya, Malawi,
Mozambique, South Africa, Uganda and Zimbabwe) consistently re-
ported that the programs had an impact on beneficiaries’ capacity to
borrow, largely due to their increased creditworthiness (Bukuluki
and Watson 2012; Selvester et al. 2012; Oxford Policy Management

 (OPM) 2013b; Zembe-Mkabile et al. 2015). In most cases, benefi-
ciaries noted that they felt ‘safe’ to borrow money or purchase food
and other household items on credit from the local market due to
their ability to pay back upon receipt of the CTs. To mitigate the
risk of indebtedness, lenders were said to often directly link the
amount of loans to the transfer size and repayment dates to the pay-
ment schedule of the cash transfer (Selvester et al. 2012).
Productive capital
The indicators commonly used across the studies for productive cap-
ital were acquisition of productive assets (agricultural assets and in-
puts) and ownership of livestock.
Eight studies covering six countries examined nine CT programs’
impact on ownership of agricultural assets and reported mixed find-
ings. In six of the programs (Uganda’s CSG and VFSG, Malawi’s
SCTP, Zambia’s CGP and MCTG, and Zimbabwe’s HSCT), there
were significant increases in households ownership of agricultural
assets (with impacts ranging from 3.6 to 32.2 pp, varying across
asset and program). In three of the programs (Lesotho’s CGP,
Kenya’s HSNP and Zambia’s MCT) there was no significant impact
on ownership of agricultural assets. We did not find any qualitative
studies reporting on CTs’ impact on agricultural assets.
With the exception of the Kenyan program, five programs (in
Ghana, Lesotho and Zambia) significantly increased household
spending on agricultural inputs (with impacts ranging from 3.2 to
17.7 pp). The agricultural inputs that households acquired or spent
funds on included seeds, fertilizer, pesticides and hired labour. We
found six qualitative studies which showed that CTs increased
households’ access to agricultural inputs, primarily the use of fertil-
izer, seeds and hiring of labour across five countries (Ghana,
Lesotho, Malawi, Kenya and Uganda).
Of 12 CT programs that have been studied with regard to their
impacts upon livestock ownership, 11 reported significant increases
in household ownership of livestock (with impacts ranging from 1.5
to 59.3 pp). Four qualitative studies (in Ghana, Kenya, Malawi and
Zimbabwe) confirmed CTs impact on household ownership of live-
stock, suggesting that investment in livestock was a risk mitigation
strategy that allowed households to build a stock of assets that they
could rely on during lean seasons and upon closure or graduation
from the CT (OPM 2013c).
Participation in NFE
Programs that monitored their impact on household ownership of
NFE showed mixed findings. For instance, the Zambian CGP

 showed consistent positive effects at 24, 36 and 48 months with
16.6, 14.6 and 13 pp increases in participation in NFEs, respect-
ively. The impacts were higher for females than males (Daidone
et al. 2014a; AIR, 2015b; Natali et al. 2016). Five other programs
(in Lesotho, Burkina Faso, Kenya, Malawi and Zambia’s MCTG)
had no impact on beneficiary households’ ownership of or participa-
tion in NFE.
While the majority of the quantitative studies showed no pro-
gram effect on NFE, five qualitative studies (in Ghana, Kenya,
Malawi, Zimbabwe) revealed that beneficiary households were ac-
tively engaged in NFE, primarily petty trading and provision of ser-
vices (OPM 2013a, 2014b, c). These studies showed that household
engagement in NFE was more of a livelihood diversification strategy
to boost household income. While the sustainability of these busi-
nesses could not be guaranteed as the money accrued from the busi-
ness was often not reinvested into the business, caregivers were said
to have used part of the CTs as start-up capital for small-scale busi-
nesses (OPM 2013a).
Education
The review identified 16 studies which have examined CT programs’
impact on education using 4 core indicators: school enrolment,
school attendance, absenteeism and learning outcomes.
School enrolment was measured in 12 programs which largely
showed positive outcomes with effect sizes ranging from a low of
0.4 pp in Ghana (Handa et al. 2014b) to 44 pp in Malawi’s ZCTP
(Baird et al. 2010). Positive impacts were however, largely found at
the secondary school level as compared to the primary school level.
For instance, Kenya’s CT-OVC significantly increased secondary
school enrolment by 3 pp compared with 0.5 pp at the primary
school level (Kenya CT-OVC Evaluation Team 2012a). A similar

They need uniforms like any other pupils at school.
If she does not have warm clothes, socks to wear

It can be very embarrassing for a child to be labelled
as poor because they did not pay for their school
fees. It also exposes the whole family. Such public
humiliation is not good because it can make the

Before CGP life was worse but now we are able to

children (OPM 2014b).
My child is 14 years old, he sometimes asks for it
[cash grant], and if he sees something at the shop
he will say: ‘Mom, don’t forget that the 1st is pay
day, there is something at the shops and I need it,
so put me on the budget.’ If I say: ‘I don’t have

Yes, yes, yes, I can say that the community has really

When the money came, I went and made a health

them to the hospital when they are sick. With the
money too, I buy medicine for them and take care
of their health needs (Owusu-Addo 2016).

In the past years it was not possible to get a birth

we force them to obtain birth certificates because of
their importance for identity purposes, for exams,
for legal protection, and to ascertain origin in
cases of familial dispute. Certificates would also
help OVC to enrol on other government pro-
grammes in the future (OPM 2014a).

I think this CSG may have reduced these risky be-

there is no need for them to go around and get
food from friends because that is where they ex-
perience sexual abuse and use drugs (DSD et al.

Women are the ones responsible for the money

Before the CT began, many OVCS didn’t use to go
to school but these days they can. It has also
enhanced security in the village—these days there
are no thefts because the children who used to
steal are now in school (Jones and Samuels 2015).
The amount of violence in recipient households has
been reduced. Before the transfer started, spouses
used to disagree a lot over whether to send their
children to school or to send them to go and do
piece works. But now, since they are receiving this
transfer, they just agree to send the children to
school and use this transfer money to buy house-
hold necessities such as food and soap (female,
age 15) (Miller 2010).

They now see us as real people with worth. . .we are

It brought more social cohesion because some peo-
ple used to suffer on their own. They did not so-
cialize with other people because they were poor
but with the coming of the programme everyone
is working together, people are now interacting
with everyone (Skovdal et al. 2013).
My social relations with my friends have become
stronger because once I receive this money, my
friends come here and we share good moments to-
gether. My elder son, who collects this money on
my behalf, has become the most humble because
he knows that he will always receive something
from me on pay days (Bukuluki and Watson

 pattern was found in Malawi’s SCTP where the effect was 15 pp at
the secondary school level compared with 13 pp at the primary
school level (Malawi SCTP Evaluation Team 2015). Data from
Burkina Faso (Baird et al. 2011) and Malawi (Akresh et al. 2016) in-
dicate that CCTs increased school enrolment significantly more than
UCTs (15 pp vs -5 pp and 0.5 times vs 0.2 times, respectively).
There were mixed findings concerning the impact of CTs on
school attendance in 10 programs. Five showed positive outcomes
(Baird et al., 2011; Robertson et al. 2012; Akresh et al. 2013, 2016;
Evans et al. 2014; Handa et al. 2016e) while five did not
(Covarrubias et al. 2012; Merttens et al. 2013, 2016; AIR 2014;
Pettifor et al., 2016). Three studies (Baird et al. 2011; Robertson
et al. 2012; Akresh et al. 2013, 2016) compared the effects of UCTs
and CCTs and found that CCTs improved school attendance signifi-
cantly more than UCTs. Two studies on the Zambia’s CGP revealed
that while the program increased school attendance at 24 months by
7 pp (Handa et al. 2016e), at 48 months the effect had disappeared
(AIR 2015b). AIR (2014) found that Zimbabwe’s HSCT was associ-
ated with reduced school attendance by 7 pp at 12 months among
beneficiary children of secondary school age. This was, however,
attributed to the large increase in school attendance in the control
group from their baseline attendance.
Evaluation of six CT programs showed a significant reduction in
school absenteeism among CTs beneficiaries compared to control
groups. In Ghana, de Groot et al. (2015) found that the program
reduced overall absenteeism by 8.5 pp. Malawi’s SCTP also reduced
absenteeism by 5 pp (Malawi SCTP Evaluation Team 2015).
With regard to learning outcomes, there was limited evidence of
program impact. However, when comparing CCT versus UCT,
CCT seemed to have a marginal benefit in Burkina Faso’s CT
(z-score of 0.2 for CCT vs 0.0 for UCT in French reading test) and
the Zomba CT in Malawi (mean score of 0.2 for CCT vs 0.1 for
UCT in cognitive test). Evans et al. (2014) found that while the CCT
in Tanzania increased literacy by 4 pp at midline (21 months) there
was no significant impact at endline (34 months).
We identified 14 qualitative studies which had explored care-
givers’ and communities’ perspectives on program impact upon edu-
cational outcomes. The findings of these studies suggest that CT
programs significantly improved school enrolment and attendance.
However, there was no clear cut distinction made between school
enrolment and school attendance. Improvements in education were
reported to be largely due to the programs’ ability to address the
material and psychological cost of schooling (e.g. reducing stigma
due to not wearing decent uniforms) (Adato et al. 2016).
Health care-utilization
We found evidence of the impact upon health services use from the
evaluation of 14 CT programs. The outcome indicators for health-
care
utilization
comprised care-seeking
behaviour
(preventive,
curative and immunisation services), antenatal care visits (ANC)
and access to skilled delivery (maternal health services).
Of 11 CT programs evaluated for their impact upon care seeking
behaviour, 9 showed positive impacts. Ghana’s program increased the
use of curative health care by 24 pp among children aged 0–5 years.
This increased use of health services could be attributed to the high
enrolment in the national health insurance scheme (NHIS) (34 pp), a
scheme which allowed registered members to have access to free
health care. Enrolment onto the NHIS, was a condition that beneficia-
ries were required to meet in this program (Handa et al. 2014b).
Malawi’s SCTP increased the likelihood of utilizing health services for
serious illness (OR ¼10.98). Malawi’s SHIS, a pilot study on incenti-
vising uptake of HIV testing results, increased the percentage of indi-
viduals collecting these by 43 pp compared with those who received

The money helps a lot if you are a mother who does
not waste it by drinking alcohol, or by doing your

me happy because I know that even if I don’t have
anything the money will come (Plagerson 2011).

 no incentive (Thornton 2008). Zimbabwe’s CCTP increased vaccin-
ation coverage by 3.1 pp in the UCT arm and by 1.8 pp in the CCT
arm (Robertson et al. 2012). Tanzania’s CB-CCT significantly
increased the number of health facility visits by 1.9 visits per year
among children aged 0–2 and by 1.1 visits among the elderly, and
increased the likelihood of using health insurance by 18 pp. While the
increased likelihood of financing medical care using health insurance
was sustained at 34 months, the impact on health facility usage had
disappeared at this time point. The reasons given for this decline
included a possible overcrowding of clinics in treatment communities,
disincentivizing attendance, or non-enforcement of the clinic attend-
ance condition (Evans et al. 2014).
Mixed evidence was found on CTs’ impact on ANC and use of
skilled delivery attendants. Nigeria’s CT program resulted in a signifi-
cant increase in the monthly number of women attending four or more
ANC visits (15/100 000 population) and the monthly number of
women receiving at least two doses of tetanus toxoid (13/100 000
population) (Okoli et al. 2014). There was, however, no significant
program effects on skilled delivery and the number of women attend-
ing first ANC visit. The Democratic Republic of Congo CT program
increased the probability of HIV-infected pregnant women remaining
in care (RR¼ 1.13) and the uptake of mother-to-child HIV transmis-
sion services (RR¼ 1.31) (Yotebieng et al. 2016). Uganda’s ACUS pilot
study increased the odds of three or more ANC (OR ¼ 1.7), but there
was no effect found for use of skilled attendants (Kahn et al. 2015).
Zambia’s CGP did not have any measurable program effects on ANC
and skilled delivery (AIR 2015b; Handa et al. 2016d).
Evidence from eight qualitative studies corroborated a number
of the quantitative findings suggesting that CTs helped beneficiaries
tackle the financial barriers that limit access to health care. The
qualitative studies found evidence relating to increases in vaccin-
ation coverage, acquisition of health insurance, and utilisation of
health services for preventive and curative care. The findings from
the qualitative evidence further showed that the CT size was often
inadequate to meet all health expenses, particularly coverage of the
cost of drugs.
Nutrition
The effect of CTs on food security was examined in seven programs
while CTs’ effect on dietary diversity was examined in nine pro-
grams. Overall, there was a consistent positive program effect on
food security across all studies. Ghana’s LEAP reduced household
food insecurity by 25 pp (Handa et al. 2014b). For Zambia’s
government-led program, the CGP reduced the food insecurity scale
by 1.9 points (AIR 2015b) while the MCTG reduced the food inse-
curity scale by 2.8 points (AIR 2015a). In Zimbabwe, contrary to
the findings of the main evaluation study which did not find any im-
pact of the HSCT on food security (AIR 2014), Bhalla et al. (2016)
using the same data found that the HSCT significantly reduced
household food insecurity by 1.3 points. Malawi’s SCTP had a sig-
nificant impact on food security by increasing the number of meals
eaten per day (0.17 points) and by reducing the proportion of house-
holds feeling food insecure by 11 pp (Malawi SCTP Evaluation
Team 2015). Lesotho’s CGP similarly had a large effect on food se-
curity by reducing the proportion of households with insufficient
food to meet their needs by 4.5 pp and the number of beneficiary
adults and children that went to sleep hungry by 7.4 pp and 3.4 pp,
respectively (Pellerano et al. 2014).
A consistent positive program effect was found for dietary diver-
sity. Tiwari et al.’s (2016) cross-country study using data from exist-
ing
large-scale
CT
evaluations
revealed
that
the
programs
significantly increased the food diversity score by 1.9, 1.5 and 0.3
points in Zambia, Kenya and Lesotho, respectively. The programs
further significantly increased the household dietary diversity score
by 1, 0.6 and 0.3 points in Zambia, Kenya and Lesotho, respect-
ively. Zimbabwe’s HSCT significantly increased the household di-
versity score by 0.75 points (Bhalla et al. 2016) while Malawi’s
SCTP significantly increased the food diversity score by 2.4 points
(Miller et al. 2011). For the government-led program in Uganda, a
significant increase in mean household food consumption was found
for the VSFG (3.8 points) and a non-significant increase for the SCG
(1.6 points) (Merttens et al. 2016). The pilot project in Uganda
(KWFP-CT) similarly increased the household dietary diversity score
by 0.6 points.
We identified 11 qualitative studies that reported consistent posi-
tive impacts of CTs on food security and food intake. These studies
showed that CTs increased beneficiaries’ access to food at the house-
hold level and afforded them the opportunity to eat more than one
meal a day (Miller et al. 2010; Jones and Samuels 2015; Owusu-
Addo 2016a). Beneficiaries were also found to have diversified their
meals by eating more fish, oil and fruits (OPM 2013a).
Employment
Seven studies reported the impact of CTs on adult labour force par-
ticipation with only one of them showing a significant effect. The
Zambian CGP resulted in a significant decrease in adult labour force
participation in wage labour outside the household (9 pp). This was
primarily driven by a shift from agricultural wage labour to family
agricultural business and NFE. The effect was stronger for house-
holds with females within the working age group compared with
households with males in this age group (Daidone et al. 2014a).
There were no qualitative studies focusing on this SDoH.
Child labour
Three programs (one from Malawi and two from Kenya) reported
significant reductions in child labour participation, ranging from 1.8
to 12.4 pp, while three others (in Lesotho, Uganda and Zimbabwe)
showed little impact on this outcome. Despite showing no overall ef-
fect, Zimbabwe’s HSCT found a significant reduction in the number
of days girls spent on farm work by 5.6 days. Similarly, in Lesotho’s
CGP there was little evidence of overall impact on child labour, but
disaggregating the analysis by gender revealed a decrease in labour
force
participation
among
boys
aged
6–17 years,
while
girls
increased their participation in paid work (Pellerano et al. 2014).
There was found to be a negative impact in Zambia’s CGP, with an
increase in child labour of 4.8 pp, largely driven by participation in
unpaid work (AIR 2015b). We found one qualitative study from
Malawi which reported a reduction in children’s participation in la-
bour as a result of being enrolled in school (Miller et al. 2010).
Program impacts on intensity of child labour measured in hours
spent on labour activities were similar to the findings about labour
force participation. Malawi’s SCTP significantly reduced by almost
1 h/week the time children spent doing paid labour outside the
household (Malawi SCTP Evaluation Team 2015). Zimbabwe’s
CCTP significantly reduced the number of hours that children spent
in paid work by half an hour in the CCT arm, and a quarter of an
hour, in the UCT arm (Fenton et al. 2016). There was no qualitative
study on this outcome indicator.
Housing conditions and quality
Of four CT programs which have evaluated their impacts upon
housing conditions, only one (Zambia’s CGP) reported significant

 housing improvements, evident from improved sanitation (owning a
toilet), cement floors, lighting and use of fuel for cooking (AIR
2015b; Handa et al. 2016e). In Burkina Faso, CTs to fathers resulted
in more investment in electricity and metal roofs compared to CTs
to mothers, while UCT (as opposed to CCT) was associated with a
lower likelihood of housing improvement (Akresh et al. 2016). In
Tanzania, while quantitative findings showed beneficiary house-
holds were less likely to improve housing conditions, qualitative
data embedded in the quantitative study showed beneficiary house-
holds spent part of the CT on improving their roofs (Evans et al.
2014). Additional evidence from five qualitative studies (in Ghana,
Kenya, Malawi and Uganda) showed that program beneficiaries
made renovations to their houses and improved their living environ-
ments, a finding which contrasted to the quantitative findings.
Birth registration
Four programs (Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi and Zimbabwe) reported
significant improvements in birth registration, with effects ranging
from 1.5 to 37 pp. Evidence from three qualitative studies support
the quantitative findings. In Zimbabwe, Skovdal et al. (2013) re-
ported that CT increased community understanding of the import-
ance of birth registration which led to increased acquisition of birth
certificates. South Africa’s Child Support Grant helped shorten the
birth registration process with birth certificates being issued by hos-
pitals and clinics to enable beneficiaries to apply for the grant (DSD
et al. 2011). In Kenya, the CT-OVC increased birth registration, but
it appears program beneficiaries were ‘forced’ to do so as captured
by the quote in Table 3 (OPM 2014a).
Child deprivation
Two indicators were used to measure child deprivation, namely: ma-
terial well-being defined as having a pair of shoes, a blanket and two
sets of clothes; and food and health deprivation. Four CTs (in
Malawi, Zambia and Zimbabwe) had consistently large impacts in
reducing child deprivation measured by material well-being with ef-
fects ranging from 11 to 33.4 pp for children aged 5–17 years.
Lesotho’s program significantly reduced child food and health de-
privation with effects ranging from 6.10 to 16.6 pp and 5.5 to 19.9
pp, respectively, with a significant effect found among children aged
0–5 years. Evidence from six qualitative studies similarly showed
that CTs reduced material deprivation among children.
Social capital and social cohesion
Four programs evaluated their impacts on social capital (measured
by trust and mutual support) and three of these (Lesotho, Tanzania
and Uganda’s VFSG) reported significant improvements ranging
from 6 to 11.8 pp. Ten qualitative studies found that CTs improved
the social capital of beneficiaries through reciprocity, networks and
civic engagement.
Evidence concerning the impact of CTs on social cohesion came
primarily from qualitative studies. CTs were said to have improved
social cohesion in diverse ways through improved security, increased
sense of belonging, enhanced social status and state-citizen social
contact. There was, however, some reports of unintended conse-
quences of creating tension and jealousy within households between
female recipients and their husbands, and at the community level be-
tween beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries. It has also been found in
selected studies that receipt of CTs was associated with an erosion
of informal support that beneficiaries previously received from im-
mediate family and other community members.
Civic participation
The findings of two studies showed that CTs significantly enhanced
beneficiaries involvement in community decision-making (effects rang-
ing from 7 to 22 pp and 3.3 to 8.3 pp in Tanzania and Uganda, re-
spectively). Six qualitative studies (in Ghana, Kenya, Mozambique,
South Africa, Uganda and Zimbabwe) reported that CTs increased
beneficiaries’ involvement in decision-making, facilitated reintegration
into community life, and increased the perception of state institutions
being accountable to citizens (Plagerson 2012; Oduro 2015).
Empowerment
The impact of CTs on empowerment was evaluated using three core
indicators: women’s decision-making power and control over re-
sources (economic and social empowerment), early marriage, and
adolescent pregnancy.
In relation to women’s decision-making power, both quantitative
and qualitative studies indicated that CTs have had limited impact
upon gendered household decision-making processes, although there
were some reports of increased involvement of women in decisions
relating to schooling and child healthcare. The results from the
quantitative studies however, indicated that women significantly
benefited from the programs through economic empowerment (sav-
ings and ownership of livestock) in Zambia’s CGP and MCT, and in
Kenya’s HSNP (Merttens et al. 2013; Handa et al. 2016a; Natali
et al. 2016). Similarly, evidence from four qualitative studies re-
vealed that by putting additional money into the hands of women,
CTs increased women’s access to and control over resources (OPM,
2013a, b, 2014a, b) (see Table 3).
The effects of CTs on empowering young women against early
marriage were examined in six quantitative studies covering three
programs. Results from Malawi’s ZCTP indicated that the program
led to significant declines in early marriage after 12 and 24 months
follow-up, as girls and young women returned to or stayed in school
(Baird et al. 2011). However, Baird et al. (2015) demonstrated that
the impact of the UCT on early marriage was not sustained two
years after program completion, whereas the CCT significantly
reduced early marriage among school drop-outs by 10.3 pp at this
follow-up point. Kenya’s CT-OVC (Handa et al. 2015) and
Zambia’s MCTG (AIR 2015a) reported no significant impact on
this outcome.
The role of CTs in empowering women by reducing adolescent
pregnancy was examined in eight programs. Three programs (ZCTP
Malawi, CT-OVC Kenya and CSG South Africa) significantly
reduced the likelihood of early pregnancy (with impacts ranging
from 3.8 to10.5 pp). Conversely, four programs (SHIS Malawi,
Malawi SCTP, HPTN South Africa and HSCT Zimbabwe) had no
significant impact on adolescent pregnancy. The lack of program ef-
fect in Malawi’s SHIS was said to be due to insufficient cash transfer
to stimulate behaviour change (Kohler and Thornton 2012).
Findings on health and quality of life outcomes
The included studies reported on the following health and quality
of life outcomes: morbidity, child anthropometry, mental health
and wellbeing, and sexual behaviours. Details of program effects
(quantitative) are provided in Supplementary Tables S13.1–13.7 in
Supplementary Data S3.
Morbidity
Of 16 programs included in the review, nine focused on child health
outcomes and most reported significant effects (7 out of 9).

 Measures used were largely mothers’ reports of health outcomes of
their children. Reduction in illness rates ranged from 4.9 pp in
Zambia (Handa et al., 2016e) to 17.02 pp in Lesotho (Pellerano
et al. 2014). Two qualitative studies reported that the frequency of
sickness had reduced among program beneficiary children.
Three studies using objective measures reported on program im-
pacts on HIV/STIs. In Tanzania, de Walque et al. (2014) found that
a high value CT (USD 20 per quarter) significantly reduced the risk
of STI, while results one year post intervention showed that the pro-
gram had sustained effects across both high and low value CTs.
Baird et al. (2012) similarly found that CTs significantly reduced the
prevalence of HIV and HSV-2 among schoolgirls. In South Africa,
there was no significant difference in HIV and HSV-2 prevalence be-
tween CT beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries (Pettifor et al. 2016).
Child anthropometry/nutritional status
Programs that evaluated their impact on anthropometric measures
generally showed mixed effects.
CTs impact on children being underweight was assessed in nine
programs. Five programs (in Burkina Faso, Lesotho, Malawi,
Tanzania and Zimbabwe) had no impact on children being under-
weight in the whole study samples. Lesotho’s CGP, however, signifi-
cantly reduced the probability of children (6 months old) being
underweight by 15 pp, but had no effect on weight status at birth
(Pellerano et al. 2014). A limitation of this study was that data were
collected from child health record cards which had very low num-
bers for observation. In Burkina Faso, Akresh et al. (2016) found
there was no program effect on underweight at 24 months, whereas
at 12 months the CCT arm had a significantly larger effect on
weight-for-age z-score (WAZ) than the UCT arm. Four programs (in
Kenya, Uganda and Zambia) showed positive but non-significant
impacts on WAZ and underweight. In the case of Zambia’s CSG,
while the program had a small positive effect on WAZ at 24 months
(Handa et al. 2016e), a negative impact was found at 48 months.
This program, however, significantly increased the proportion of
children receiving the minimum amount of feeding by 21.7 pp at
48 months and by 13.4 pp at 24 months (AIR 2015b; Handa et al.
2016e).
Evaluation of seven programs concerning their impact on child
wasting also showed no consistent positive impact. In Burkina Faso,
Akresh et al. (2016) found that CCTs had a stronger impact than
UCTs in improving arm circumference-for-age z-score. Malawi’s
SCTP significantly reduced the prevalence of wasting by 2 pp
(Malawi SCTP Evaluation Team 2015). Five other programs
(Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe) reported no
impact on child wasting. Of eight programs evaluated for their im-
pact on stunting, one had a significant positive impact (the CCT
component of Burkina Faso’s program) while the others reported no
impact. No qualitative study was found on this outcome.
Mental health outcomes
Mental health indicators (happiness, hope, psychological distress
and depression) were measured in six programs of which four pro-
grams showed significant improvements across these indicators with
effects ranging from 6.3 to 22 pp. In Malawi’s ZCTP, UCT signifi-
cantly reduced psychological distress among adolescent schoolgirls
by 14.3 pp compared to CCT (6.3 pp) (Baird et al. 2013b). This
study reported that factors such as improvements in physical health,
increased schooling, family support for education and increased lev-
els of individual consumption and leisure accounted for the positive
program impacts among schoolgirls. Results from eight qualitative
studies indicated that CTs improved mental health outcomes by
increasing self-esteem and reducing stress, anxiety, worrying, de-
pression and stigmatisation against program beneficiaries.
Sexual behaviour
Two sexual behaviour outcomes were assessed in the included stud-
ies: sexual debut and multiple sexual partners. Of seven programs
where impacts were assessed on sexual debut among young people,
five showed significant reductions with effects ranging from 3.1 to
13 pp. Program impact in reducing sexual debut was found among
girls but not for boys in South Africa’s government-led CT (Cluver
et al. 2013), whereas the opposite was the case in Malawi’s
government-led CT (Malawi SCTP Evaluation Team 2015).
Of five programs evaluated, four showed significant reductions
in the probability of young people aged 13–25 years having multiple
sexual partners, but with mixed effects when disaggregated by gen-
der. Kenya’s government-led CT had no significant impact on the
number of sexual partners and transactional sex (Handa et al.
2014a). Evidence from three qualitative studies revealed that CTs
reduced risky sexual behaviours, particularly transactional sex. The
mechanism by which CTs reduced risky sexual behaviour was re-
portedly through the income effect, as this enabled young women to
leave or not to engage in violent relationships (Miller et al. 2010;
DSD et al. 2011; Adato et al. 2016).
Findings on health inequalities
We found no study providing data that might be useful in examining
CTs impact on health inequalities. It was observed that studies
which provided sub-group analyses had no clear intention of testing
pre-specified hypotheses about differential effects of CTs. In spite of
these limitations, we present results from studies that reported in-
consistent findings about the impacts of CTs on health inequalities.
Akresh et al. (2012) found that there was no difference in the
number of routine preventive healthcare visits for children living in
extremely poor households compared with those living in less poor
households. In contrast, in Malawi, strong impacts on the use of
curative healthcare services were found among the poorest house-
holds (12 pp). There was also a significant reduction in first adoles-
cent pregnancy among females in the poorest households (4 pp)
compared to the overall sample of households in the treatment
group (Malawi SCTP Evaluation Team 2015). Malawi’s SCTP fur-
ther reported a significant reduction in young men engaging in sex-
ual activity by 9 pp while there was an insignificant impact among
females (3 pp). However, this may have been because, regardless of
treatment status, males were more likely to report sexual debut
(Malawi SCTP Evaluation Team 2015). In contrast, in South Africa,
the CSG had a significant impact in reducing the probability of fe-
males engaging in sexual activity (11.1 pp) while there was an insig-
nificant impact among males (3.1 pp) (Heinrich et al. 2017).
Program impact in reducing sexual debut among females was largely
driven by a reduction in transactional sex (Cluver et al. 2013), pos-
sibly as a result of the income effect of the program. In Kenya,
Handa et al. (2014a) found that CTs significantly reduced the rela-
tive odds of sexual debut among females compared to males.
Akresh et al. (2016) observed that the impact of CTs on the use
of preventive healthcare services was fairly consistent across boys
and girls in Burkina Faso. CTs were however, found to have signifi-
cantly improved WAZ and reduced illness episodes for boys, but not
for girls. Handa et al. (2014 b) found that Ghana’s CT had a stron-
ger impact on children aged 0–5 years enrolling in a national health
690

 insurance scheme (34 pp) than children age 6–17 years (16 pp). The
effect was also higher among children aged 0–5 years living in fe-
male headed households than those living in male headed house-
holds. Similarly, Malawi’ SCTP significantly reduced the prevalence
of wasting by 2 pp among children living in female headed house-
holds compared to children living in male headed households
(Malawi SCTP Evaluation Team 2015). These indicate that the gen-
der of household head and the size of the household moderate CT
impact. Akresh et al. (2012) also found that CCTs had a larger im-
pact for older children’s (24–59 months) use of preventive healthcare
services (0.6 visits) than for younger children (0–23 months) (0.1 vis-
its) in Burkina Faso.
Contextual factors (barriers and facilitators)
Many of the program impacts described above are clearly influenced
by contextual factors surrounding CT design and implementation,
and beneficiary households. Supplementary Data S4 provides a sum-
mary of the factors that enabled or hindered program impacts
gleaned from the included studies.
The size of the transfer and regularity of transfer payment were
the dominant factors reported as influences upon the effectiveness of
CTs. For instance, Pellerano et al. (2014) noted that frequent trans-
fers of sufficient amount were likely to have increased health ser-
vices use and household consumption. Tiwari et al.’s (2016)
assessment of CTs impact across four countries found that vari-
ations in the size of transfer had implications for the range and size
of program effects on food security and nutrition outcomes. In
Niger, it was found that CTs alone had no impact on acute malnu-
trition and severe acute malnutrition unless CTs were combined
with supplementary food (Langendorf et al. 2014). Limited access
to markets, agricultural inputs and opportunities for commercial
activities was found to have reduced beneficiaries’ participation in
NFE in five countries (OPM 2013a, b, 2014a, b, c).
Handa et al. (2014 b) described how inflation eroded the real
value of the CT in Ghana making it difficult for households to meet
their consumption needs. The authors found that in 2010 the trans-
fer level was 11% of consumption expenditure among target benefi-
ciaries, but the real value was reduced to 7% by 2012 due to
inflation.
Skovdal et al. (2013) observed that active participation of the
community in program design and implementation improved ac-
ceptance of program conditions in Zimbabwe. Community accept-
ance of program conditions was said to have enhanced social
cohesion by reducing tension among transfer recipients and non-
recipients.
Household level factors such as gender norms, household size
and composition, and intra-household dynamics were reported as
influences upon the impact of CTs. For instance, in Burkina Faso,
Akresh et al. (2016) observed that CTs to fathers had a significant
impact on child nutritional outcomes compared to CTs to mothers.
This finding was attributed to the fact that in Burkina Faso fathers
are often the breadwinners in the household (Kazianga and Wahhaj
2013) and are likely to have been obliged to allocate a greater part
of the CT to food than mothers (Akresh et al. 2016).
Discussion
This systematic review was the first to synthesise the evidence on the
impact of CTs on SDoH and health inequalities in SSA, as well as
identifying the barriers and facilitators of an effective CT. Both
quantitative and qualitative evidence show that CTs can be effective
in tackling structural determinants of health such as financial pov-
erty, education, household resilience, child labour, social capital and
social cohesion, civic participation, and birth registration. The re-
view further found that CTs can modify intermediate determinants
such as material circumstances (nutrition and dietary diversity, child
deprivation, savings, household consumption, capacity to borrow in
times of need), psychosocial circumstances (relief from debt,
self-esteem, reduced stress, anxiety and worrying), sexual risk be-
haviours among adolescents (sexual debut, multiple partners and
transactional sex), adolescent empowerment (reduced early mar-
riage and pregnancy), and utilization of health services. As a result
of their influence on structural and intermediate determinants of
health, there is some moderate evidence that CTs impact on health
and quality of life outcomes (morbidity, HIV/STIs, child growth sta-
tus and mental health).
The quality of the evidence on SDoH
As shown in Table 2, using the GRADE approach, the overall qual-
ity of evidence on financial poverty reduction is moderate. This
shows that CTs are effective in reducing short-term poverty, a find-
ing which is supported by other CT reviews (Fiszbein and Schady
2009; Leroy et al. 2009). There is also high quality evidence that
CTs significantly increase both total household consumption and
food consumption, which aligns with Kabeer and Waddington’s
(2015) review concerning the impact of CCTs in Latin America.
Overall, there is moderate quality evidence of CTs impact on
household resilience. Within the resilience domain, while the
GRADE criteria indicates high quality evidence on household cap-
acity to borrow and/or be relieved from debt, studies assessed using
ConQual criteria indicate moderate quality evidence. The qualita-
tive evidence suggests that some beneficiaries are still unable to bor-
row due to fear of being in debt. Similarly, beneficiaries are largely
able to borrow from informal sources as they are unable to meet the
requirements of financial institutions. There is moderate evidence,
using GRADE, of program impact on household productive capacity
through acquisition of agricultural inputs and assets. This aligns
with a recent study by FAO (2015) which found that CTs are essen-
tial for increasing agricultural productivity among poor households.
Using both GRADE and ConQual criteria, the quality of evi-
dence in relation to CTs impact on education is strong, particularly
for school enrolment, which is consistent with previous systematic
reviews (Baird et al., 2013a; Snilstveit et al., 2015). Moderate qual-
ity evidence was, however, found in relation to school attendance
and absenteeism, and low quality evidence for learning outcomes.
Both Baird et al. (2013a) and Snilstveit et al.’s (2015) reviews also
found that CTs had limited impact upon learning outcomes.
There is moderate quality evidence concerning CTs impact on
use of preventive and curative health services using both GRADE
and ConQual criteria. This finding aligns with other reviews with
studies from Latin America which found that CTs increased health
service utilization (Lagarde et al. 2007; Gaarder et al. 2010;
Ranganathan and Lagarde 2012; Bassani et al. 2013; Glassman
et al. 2013; Owusu-Addo and Cross 2014). There is also moderate
quality evidence on antenatal visits and skilled delivery using
GRADE which suggests a beneficial effect of CTs upon maternal
and child health outcomes. Qualitative evidence from the review
however, indicates that while CTs play a critical role in removing
the financial barriers associated with utilising health services, the
money is not enough to meet all expenses associated with medical
care.

 Using both grading criteria, there is high quality evidence of CTs
impact on food security and dietary diversity. Reviews which have
primarily focused on CTs in Latin America have also found that
CTs influence food consumption and diversity of food intake (Leroy
et al. 2009; Manley et al. 2013; Martins et al. 2013; Ruel and
Alderman 2013; Owusu-Addo and Cross 2014).
Based on the GRADE criteria, there is low quality evidence of
program impact on adult employment. We found one significant de-
crease in non-agricultural labour wage participation in Zambia.
Similarly, Lesotho’s CGP resulted in a reduction in engagement in
paid work outside the household. However, overall there is limited
evidence to suggest that CTs result in a withdrawal from the labour
force by adults. Our findings are similar to those of Kabeer and
Waddington (2015) who found that CCTs had no consistent effects
on adult labour participation in Latin America. For child labour,
both GRADE and ConQual criteria point to high quality evidence
of CTs’ ability to reduce child labour force participation and inten-
sity. Our findings corroborate those of de Hoop and Rosati (2014)
and Kabeer and Waddington (2015) whose reviews found that CTs
reduced the prevalence of child labour in Latin America. In regard
to CTs positive impact on child registration there is moderate qual-
ity evidence from quantitative studies but low quality evidence from
qualitative studies. Birth registration is a major structural determin-
ant of child health, affecting children’s access and utilisation of a
broad range of critical health and social services (Commission on
Social Determinants of Health 2008).
Following GRADE and ConQual, there is high quality evidence
of CT’s ability to reduce child deprivation through improvement in
material well-being and food availability. The quality of evidence on
child poverty reduction is also high using the ConQual approach.
This concurs with Barrientos and DeJong’s (2006) argument that
CTs can reduce child poverty despite differences in their design.
However, to further cushion children against the worst forms of
poverty and deprivation, there is the need to include clearly defined
indicators relating to child poverty and deprivation in CT’s design
and evaluation.
Both GRADE and ConQual criteria show moderate quality evi-
dence of CT’s impact on social capital and social cohesion. While
the evidence around social capital in terms of reciprocity, linking
and bridging capital is strong from both quantitative and qualitative
studies, the evidence concerning program impact on social cohesion
is mixed from the qualitative studies. This finding is similar to that
from Pavanello et al.’s (2016) examination of CT programs in the
Middle East region and SSA which found that CTs contributed to
bonding social capital, but had negative effects in terms of fuelling
intra-community tensions and generating ill-feelings at the commu-
nity level. However, in the present review, Skovdal et al. (2013) re-
ported that active community participation in CTs design and
implementation ameliorated intra-household and intra-community
cohesion to help reduce the program’s negative impact on social
cohesion.
Relatedly, there is moderate evidence using both GRADE and
ConQual criteria that CTs improve civic participation and contrib-
ute to beneficiaries’ ability to take steps to hold the state account-
able. CTs seem to have the potential to reduce exclusion of the poor
from community decision-making processes, but this impact re-
quires further exploration.
Assessment using GRADE and ConQual criteria indicates that
there is low quality evidence of program impact on women’s
decision-making power in the household. Cultural norms and patri-
archal rules which are difficult to contest were identified as key fac-
tors limiting women’s decision-making power in the household.
There is, however, some evidence of program impact on women’s
economic empowerment in terms of building their capital stock and
engagement in NFEs. These findings align with those from evalu-
ations of CT programs in Latin America where, even though women
are the major recipients of CTs (Handa et al. 2009), program impact
upon their empowerment remains unclear (Yoong et al. 2012; de
Brauw et al. 2014).
In relation to adolescent empowerment, assessment by the
GRADE criteria shows high quality evidence of impact in reducing
adolescent pregnancy and moderate quality evidence of reducing
early marriage. This is very encouraging considering the increased
rate of adolescent pregnancy in SSA with its high adverse effects on
the health of pregnant teens and that of the unborn child (Owusu-
Addo et al. 2016; WHO 2014a, b). This review suggests that CTs’
impact on pregnancy could be attributed to increased school enrol-
ment and school attendance, short-term poverty reduction among
households, and reduced sexual debut.
Quality of evidence: health and quality of life
Following GRADE, there is high quality evidence of program impact
in reducing childhood morbidity. This aligns with a previous review
of CTs’ impact in Latin America which found that these improve
children’s health status (Owusu-Addo and Cross 2014). However,
there is low-quality evidence of program impact on nutritional out-
comes among children aged 0–5 years. This finding contrasts with
the evidence from Latin America which shows that CTs significantly
improve child anthropometry (Leroy et al. 2009). This suggests that
the strong evidence of program impact upon food security and food
expenditure in households found in this review does not translate
into program impacts on children’s nutritional status. A number of
factors could explain this, including behavioural and environmental
factors (e.g. access to water and sanitation), transfer size, and house-
hold size. For instance, in Malawi, while there was no overall pro-
gram impact upon stunting, there was a 16pp reduction in stunting
among children living in households with less than four members
(Malawi SCTP Evaluation Team 2015). De Groot et al. (2017) fur-
ther note that caregiver feeding behaviours and practices and psy-
chosocial care mediate CT impact on child nutritional outcomes.
Both GRADE and ConQual assessment point to moderate qual-
ity evidence of CTs’ impact on mental health outcomes. Evidence
from qualitative studies indicated that by improving the living con-
ditions of households through the provision of basic needs such as
food and education, CTs improved the subjective wellbeing of care-
givers and children.
There is moderate quality evidence of program impact on sexual
debut and the number of sexual partners among young people using
GRADE. Appraisal of studies using the ConQual criteria shows
moderate quality evidence of program impact on risky sexual behav-
iours. From the qualitative evidence, CTs seem to reduce risky sex-
ual behaviours through the income effect. Similarly, using GRADE
criteria, there is moderate quality evidence of the potential of CTs as
a tool for HIV/STI prevention by incentivising safer sexual practices.
However, it must be noted that the evidence around HIV/STI pre-
vention from the included studies came from small-scale CCT pro-
grams, with no evidence from large-scale programs.
CTs’ impact on health inequalities
The findings indicate that in relation to health and nutrition out-
comes, CTs might be more effective for the extremely poor house-
holds,
families
with
small
household
size,
female
headed
households, and children aged 0–5 years. However, these findings

 are not conclusive as they are based on very limited studies, and
should be regarded as hypotheses for future examination. Further,
most studies were not adequately powered for sub-group analyses
and are susceptible to type 1 errors.
Strengths and limitations
To our knowledge this is the first systematic review that includes both
quantitative and qualitative studies to provide a deeper understanding
of CTs’ impacts on SDoH and health outcomes. Because studies exam-
ining SDoH have been undertaken in diverse fields across a range of
disciplines, the search strategy in this review included multiple evidence
sources, and was piloted and revised. We acknowledge that the exclu-
sion of studies in languages other than English is a limitation.
However, in SSA English is the primary language of official business
and is widely used for communications in the international arena
(Plonski et al. 2013). We anticipate, therefore, that the vast majority of
relevant studies are likely to be published in English. The external val-
idity of the review findings is very strong as the findings largely com-
pare favourably to those from Latin America. The findings thus
provide useful insights to policy makers and managers and can be used
to optimise CTs to reduce health inequities.
Future research and evaluation
The review findings point to a major gap in knowledge regarding
the mechanisms by which CTs influence SDoH and health out-
comes. Both quantitative and qualitative studies included in this re-
view largely failed to explore CTs’ mechanisms of change. For
instance, Pettifor et al.’s (2016, p. 985) study on the effect of CCT
on HIV prevalence in South Africa concluded that: ‘mechanisms
through which the cash transfer might have reduced physical vio-
lence by a partner or sexual behaviour in this study are not clear’.
Similarly, Handa et al.’s (2016, p. 18) study of Kenya’s CT-OVC
concluded: ‘we have provided evidence that large-scale government
run, unconditional cash transfers can positively impact sexual be-
haviours of young people in Africa, but the pathways remain un-
clear’. This points to a shortcoming of current approaches used to
evaluate CT programs. It follows that future evaluations should con-
sider using theory-driven approaches to evaluation such as realist
evaluation (Pawson and Tilley 1997; Pawson 2013) which seeks to
uncover the mechanisms by which programs bring about various
outcomes in the contexts in which they are delivered.
As stated above, there has been little attention in CTs’ evalu-
ations to impacts upon health inequalities. In order to increase
knowledge in this area, future evaluations need to be planned for
sub-group analyses ensuring that they are adequately powered for
this. The differential effects of CTs should be examined along
PROGRESS categories (place of residence, ethnic origin, occupa-
tion, gender, religion, education, socioeconomic status and social
capital). The PROGRESS terms, however, may require further
modification to include household size and gender of household
heads in the SSA context, as the findings of this review indicate that
these factors may moderate program impacts.
Conclusion
There is an increasing call to address the SDoH and health inequal-
ities through the implementation of culturally acceptable interven-
tions, particularly in SSA. The important finding from this review is
that there is strong evidence that CTs impact on structural and inter-
mediate determinants of health in this region. There is however,
moderate evidence of programs impact on health outcomes. This
implies that supplementary services and behaviour change interven-
tions are critical to enhancing CTs impact on health outcomes.
Similarly, CTs may have a significant negative impact on social co-
hesion. Therefore, it is important that their design, implementation
and evaluation move beyond a focus on material impacts (e.g. pov-
erty, education, nutrition, etc.) to take account of their impact on
social relations, given that negative effects in this domain are likely
to undermine the scale and sustainability of their impacts upon
SDoH and health outcomes.
The review further shows that while CTs can produce short- to
medium-term impacts on both SDoH and health outcomes, the
long-term durability of these outcomes is unclear. Investigation of
the sustainability of the outcomes engendered by CTs should be a
priority in future studies.
Lastly, this systematic review found many factors relating to
intervention design, macroeconomic stability, household dynamics
and community acceptance of programs that could influence effect-
iveness of CTs. These should be taken into consideration by policy
makers during the design and adjustment of CTs, and by evaluators
to account for contextual influences upon program implementation
and impact.
