Design principles of a human mimetic humanoid:
Humanoid platform to study human intelligence
and internal body system
Yuki Asano,* Kei Okada, Masayuki Inaba
Many systems and mechanisms in the human body are not fully understood, such as the principles of muscle
control, the sensory nervous system that connects the brain and the body, learning in the brain, and the human
walking motion. To address this knowledge deficit, we propose a human mimetic humanoid with an un-
precedented degree of anatomical fidelity to the human musculoskeletal structure. The fundamental concept
underlying our design is to consider the human mechanism, which contrasts with the conventional engineering
approach used in the design of existing humanoids. We believe that the proposed human mimetic humanoid
can be used to provide new opportunities in science, for instance, to quantitatively analyze the internal data of
a human body in movement. We describe the principles and development of human mimetic humanoids, Kenshiro
and Kengoro, and compare their anatomical fidelity with humans in terms of body proportions, skeletal structures,
muscle arrangement, and joint performance. To demonstrate the potential of human mimetic humanoids, Kenshiro
and Kengoro performed several typical human motions.
INTRODUCTION
For at least the last two millennia, human beings have endeavored to
understand the systems and mechanisms that make up the human
body, such as the principles of muscle control, the sensory nervous
system that connects the brain and the body, the mechanisms of
learning in the brain, and the accomplishment of the simple act of
walking. In recent years, technology has developed to the point where
humanoid robots that mimic human body structures are now being
constructed, and these enable us to study the systems in the human
body by making humanoids or through experimental trials in the
real world. However, a limitation of conventional humanoids is that
they have been designed on the basis of the theories of conventional
engineering, mechanics, electronics, and informatics. They are also
primarily intended for engineering-oriented applications, such as task
achievement in daily life, personal assistance, or disaster response. By
contrast, our intent is to design a humanoid based on human systems—
including the musculoskeletal structure, sensory nervous system, and
methods of information processing in the brain—to support science-
oriented goals, such as gaining a deeper understanding of the internal
mechanisms of humans.
Our research team has successfully developed musculoskeletal
robots (1–5), and it seems possible to use these to our stated purpose
because they imitate the human musculoskeletal structure, support
the flexible body and behaviors of humans, and support human-style
muscle actuation using tendon-driven actuators. However, those
musculoskeletal robots are not accurate enough for our purpose
from an anatomical point of view, such as body proportions, muscle
arrangements, and joint structures, although their actuation does
mimic human muscle contraction. Other research teams have also
successfully developed musculoskeletal robots from an anthropomi-
metic point of view (6–12). The body structures and shapes of their
robots were inspired from humans, and they provided effective
schemes for controlling and modeling those kinds of robots. How-
ever, their robots were not capable of performing whole-body mo-
tions because they did not have tendon-driven legs for supporting
their weight.
Therefore, we propose a human mimetic humanoid that pro-
vides a high degree of anatomical fidelity to the human structure
and is capable of whole-body motions. We believe that such a hu-
man mimetic humanoid can provide new opportunities to advance
science, such as in the field of musculoskeletal physical simulation,
to capture and quantitatively analyze the internal data of a moving
human body using the sensors of a human mimetic humanoid.
Here, we detail the design principles of an anatomically correct hu-
man mimetic humanoid in the following areas: (i) body proportions,
(ii) skeletal structures, (iii) muscle arrangement, and (iv) joint
performance.
We also describe the development of the Kenshiro and Kengoro
humanoids as examples. The human mimetic design concept is the
common concept for each humanoid. Kenshiro is the first humanoid
developed based on the concept, and then Kengoro was developed
with a lot of improvements for a higher degree of fidelity to humans.
These humanoids have anatomically correct musculoskeletal
structures in their bodies, so that we can evaluate the fidelity of the
musculoskeletal structures relative to that of a human. A design
overview of the proposed human mimetic humanoid is shown in Fig. 1.
RESULTS
In this section, we describe the anatomical fidelity of Kenshiro and
Kengoro and evaluate how accurately their musculoskeletal struc-
ture mimics that of a human in the four specific areas of interest.
Body proportion fidelity
The body proportions of Kenshiro and Kengoro were designed by
using human statistical data (13–16) as the design target, so that
the humanoids would have more human-like body proportions,
and the link lengths of Kenshiro and Kengoro were designed on
the basis of the corresponding lengths in a human body. To evaluate

 their human mimetic body proportions, we conducted a link length
comparison between Kenshiro, Kengoro, and an average human
using the body segments shown in Table 1. Note that the ratio of the
human link length and weight has been reported in several studies. The
results indicated that the average link lengths in Kenshiro and Kengoro
versus a human were 101 and 99.3%, respectively.
A comparison of the mass distribution
properties between Kenshiro, Kengoro,
and an average human was also conducted.
The results of this comparison are pres-
ented in Table 2, where it can be seen that
Kenshiro and Kengoro exhibited an aver-
age of 115 and 116% of the mass of an aver-
agehuman,respectively.Thus,weconfirmed
that the assembled humanoids exhibited
high fidelity from the mass distribution
point of view.
Skeletal structure fidelity
In terms of the skeletal structure evalua-
tion, we compared the number of degrees
of freedom (DOFs) between a human and
several humanoids, including Kenshiro
and Kengoro. In a human, 548 joint DOFs
have been identified; when excluding
the face and hands, there are 419 DOFs
based on the number of bone connec-
tions according to their functional clas-
sification (17). Each joint may include
one, two, or three DOFs. The compari-
son of joint DOFs, excluding those of
the face and hands based on the data
of Kenshiro, Kengoro, or other life-sized
humanoids (3, 4, 18–25), is shown in
Fig. 2. These humanoids can be largely
separated into two groups. The first group
(that is, the axial-driven group) is com-
posed of ordinary humanoids with actua-
tors at each joint to move their structural
links, and the number of joint DOFs is
27 to35.Examplesofthisgroupincludethe
HRP2 or ASIMO humanoids. The second
group (that is, the tendon-driven group) is
composed of tendon-driven humanoids
with human-inspired musculoskeletal
structures that have a relatively large num-
ber of joint DOFs (55 to 114). The use of
multiple spine joints is one of the most im-
portant factors required to approach the
flexibility of a human, and the number
of DOFs of current humanoids is limited
by whether the humanoid has spinal flex-
ibility. Kenshiro has 64 DOFs, which is
just 15% of the 419 DOFs possessed by a
human. Multiple spine joints and a yaw
rotational DOF in the knee joint are the
reason for the relatively larger number of
whole-body DOFs compared with other
humanoids.Kengoro has114 DOFs,which
is 27% of the number possessed by humans and is the largest number of
DOFs among life-sized humanoids. When hand DOFs are included,
Kengoro is equipped with 174 DOFs. Multiple DOFs in its end effectors
are considered the reason for the increased number of DOFs. End ef-
fectors are a challenging topic in humanoid robotics, and a large gap
remains in this area between humanoids and humans.

 Muscle arrangement fidelity
A human mimetic muscle arrangement
means that muscle actuators are placed
and arranged so that they replicate muscle
origin and insertion points based on hu-
man anatomy. This arrangement enables
the naming of muscle actuators in a mus-
culoskeletal humanoid to match that in
humans, which, in turn, increasing the
plausibility of the muscle data obtained
from the movement of the human mimetic
humanoid. A comparison of the number of
synonymous muscles between humans
and several musculoskeletal robots, in-
cluding Kenshiro and Kengoro, is presented
in Table 3. Human muscles important for
whole-body motions and joint movements
were counted. The muscles for face or or-
gans are eliminated from the number. In
the table, the count is not based on the
muscle (actuator) number but the name of
the muscle, because there are cases where
Kenshiro and Kengoro are equipped with
multiple muscle actuators that represent a
single muscle. For example, Kenshiro is
equipped with two muscle actuators that
represent the gastrocnemius muscle to en-
sure enough muscle output. In the spine,
Kenshiro and Kengoro have a higher num-
ber of muscle relationships than other robots.

 the hand, Kenshiro and Kengoro are equipped with 27.0 and 51.4%,
respectively, of the muscles of humans. Kengoro has a larger number
of muscles than Kenshiro, because the muscles for its forearm and wrist
contribute to increasing the number of muscles. In the leg, excluding the
inner muscles of the foot, Kenshiro and Kengoro are equipped with 50.0
and 57.1% of the muscles of humans. In the entire body comparison,
excluding the inner muscles of the hand and the foot, the muscle fidelity
of Kenshiro and Kengoro are 37.7 and 49.1%, respectively, in that of
humans. On the basis of these results, we confirmed that the human
mimetic humanoids Kenshiro and Kengoro have the largest rate of
muscle fidelity with respect to humans when compared to the other hu-
manoids. Nevertheless, when the muscles of the hands and feet are in-
cluded, the fidelity decreases to 30.1% for Kenshiro and 39.1% for
Kengoro. These results are due to the muscles for the end effectors being
a large part of the entire muscle ratio of humans. Thus, end effectors are
quite important for humans in their daily lives. This suggests that it is
essential to develop human mimetic end effectors to move humanoid
robotics forward.
Joint performance fidelity
A joint range comparison between Kenshiro, Kengoro, and an aver-
age human was conducted. Note that the joint range of a human has
been reported in (17, 26, 27). The mechanical joint range of Kenshiro
and Kengoro were examined using geometrical computer-aided design
models or actual movement of the real robot, and the neck, spine,
shoulder, elbow, hip, knee, and ankle joint ranges were compared.
The results are shown in Fig. 3. We confirmed that almost all the
joint ranges of Kenshiro and Kengoro are similar to those of humans,
indicating that these humanoids can achieve flexible human-like pos-
tures. In particular, the spherical joints in the shoulder and hip enable
joint movements over a wide range. A multijointed spine is a human
mimetic joint that enables human-like flexible poses. In the humanoid,
a human-like wide range of motion can be achieved because of the hu-
man mimetic muscle arrangement. A redundant muscle arrangement
ensures sufficient joint torque near the joint limit, where the stability
of the joint tends to decrease because of insufficient constraint force.
DISCUSSION
Summary
Here, we described our work on human mimetic humanoids, whose
musculoskeletal systems are as close as possible to that of a human.
We proceeded with the study based on the idea that the features crucial
for improving humanoids are hidden behind the structure and motion
processes of humans. Hence, we incorporated elements that facilitate
fidelity with the human musculoskeletal system. To realize these hu-
manoid systems, we mimicked human musculoskeletal structures
based on our knowledge of anatomy. In terms of the design principles
of the human mimetic humanoid, our design centered around four
key areas—body proportion, skeletal structure, muscle arrangement,
and joint performance—and the humanoids Kenshiro and Kengoro
were developed on this basis. We conducted an evaluation of their
design by comparing them with humans or existing humanoids and
confirmed that the two humanoids have great anatomical fidelity
to humans.
Flexibility or rigidity
A conventional design approach is based on the improvement of ri-
gidity that makes a humanoid rigid and structurally strong. It is better
for controlling of humanoids in accurate positions; however, with
those approaches, humanoids tend to be bulky. On the other hand,
a flexible part in the body, such as the spine, is helpful for producing
human-like flexible motions, but it tends to be structurally weak. We
think that there is a trade-off between flexibility (weakness) and rigid-
ity (strength). We believe that incorporating flexibility inspired from
living things is more important than rigidity to make humanoids
more human-like. Therefore, we incorporated flexibility of humans
into the structure of our humanoids.

 Future applications
We believe that human mimetic humanoids have the potential to be
used in several new applications that have not been considered pre-
viously. For example, human body musculoskeletal simulators can
be used to obtain information related to the invisible internal body
of humans by evaluating sensory data received from human mimetic
humanoids in the real world. This type of simulator can also be used
to verify hypotheses regarding human control by applying control
programs artificially implemented from the human system, because
human mimetic humanoids have structures quite close to those of
humans. These tools can be used to provide a deeper understanding
of the human mechanism. In addition, other practical applications
are also possible. An interesting application is active crash test dum-
mies used during car crash testing, because current dummies can on-
ly measure passive behavior. A human mimetic humanoid enables
the replication of human reflective behavior by muscle actuation.
One research group has suggested the
possibility that a musculoskeletal hu-
manoid can be used in medicine, such
as to grow tissue grafts (28). If a human-
oid can replicate human movements,
then the resulting muscle contribution
analysis or sensory data obtained during
motionwillbenefitathletesorsportstrain-
ers. In addition, human-shaped robotic
limbs are also expected to be used in other
fields, such as for artificial limbs or tele-
operated human agents.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Four design principles
We are concentrating on the capability
of whole-body motions by our human
mimetic humanoids to achieve our goals
(for example, a physical musculoskeletal
simulator in the real world for motion
analysis of humans). To satisfy the re-
quirement and emulate human, similarity
of kinematics and dynamics between a
human and the humanoid are quite im-
portant. We considered comprehensively
following factors for developing human
mimetic humanoids and decided that
the four principles should be our focus.
Similar link lengths and mass distri-
butions (in other words, body proportions)
to humans provide similar kinematics and
dynamics. Sensory data obtained from
those humanoid movements have high
correlations to those of humans. In addi-
tion, strong similarity also enables these
humanoids to fit in the environment for
humans,suchasusingtools,wearingclothes
for humans, or getting in a car.
A high degree of anatomical fidelity in
skeletal structures is effective for emulat-
ing human body characteristics. Human
joints are not only single-axis rotation
joints, but also are rolling-sliding joints that are composed of a com-
bination of rotation and sliding movement between the bones (for ex-
ample, knee joint). Spine joints with multiple vertebrae are effective to
make various human-like postures and flexible upper body movement.
Human-like multiple DOFs in the entire body are effective for adaptive
environmental contact or movement under environmental constraint.
On the basis of the basic equations for tendon-driven robots t =
tGT and t = tJF (where t is joint torque, T is muscle tension, F is
end-effector force, G is muscle Jacobian, and J is Jacobian), muscle-
joint-operational state mappings are necessary to control musculo-
skeletal robots. Muscle arrangements are important for deciding those
mapping characteristics. Anatomically correct muscle arrangements
can provide muscle contribution in correct tendency during the
whole-body motions.
Joint performances are related to the above-mentioned three prop-
erties and decide humanoid performance in terms of whole-body

 motion. Joint range and output power were determined by skeletal
structures and by a combination of joint moment arm and muscle
output power, respectively. Similar joint range and joint output power
are essential for useful analyses of human motions by the humanoid.
How to design a human mimetic humanoid
To develop a humanoid with human body proportions, the use of
statistical data is important. Similar studies were conducted for the
development of the HRP4 (20) and HRP4-C (21) humanoids. In our
case, the design priority was to achieve bone lengths and limb shapes
similar to those of humans. With this priority in mind, the compo-
nents, muscle actuators, skeletal structure, and electrical compo-
nents were designed and placed by trial and error.
The skeletal structure of the human mimetic humanoid was de-
signed to imitate the skeletal shape, joint structure, and joint DOFs
of humans. During the design process, we first studied human skel-
etal structures and extracted essential human skeletal mechanisms
and functions that were considered useful for humanoids. Then, we
simplified the biologically complex human joint structures into mechan-
ical humanoid structures by extracting and focusing on certain
functions. In addition, we considered mechanical designs or elements
that enabled us to realize the important functions.
To develop a human mimetic humanoid with a human mimetic
muscle arrangement, the humanoid should be equipped with as many
muscle actuators as possible; however, trade-offs must be considered
between the number of muscle actuators and the available design space.
To overcome this challenge, we adopted a dense arrangement of muscle
actuators. By modularizing the muscle actuators, we were able to ef-
fectively implement many muscles in the entire body. Muscle insertion
points of the humanoids are decided according to those of humans.
However, a muscle expressed by a wire can only emulate just a point
insertion, not regional attachment. Planar muscle is adopted to emulate
regional attachment or multiple points to more correct emulation of
the human.
Development of Kenshiro
Kenshiro incorporated human mimetic musculoskeletal structures
based on the knowledge of human anatomy that we obtained (1, 29–31).
Figure 4 shows the body specification of Kenshiro. For Kenshiro devel-
opment, the target body parameters were those of an around average
13-year-old Japanese male, which is 158 cm and 50 kg. It was important
that the body have the multi-DOFs structure of a human because this
provides flexibility and adaptability to the environment. Kenshiro was
equipped with several unique joints inspired by those of humans, such
as multiple spine joints (32), screw-home mechanisms (33), and open-
sphere joints (34). The spine joints provide a wide range of motion to
the upper body. The screw-home mechanism in the knee provides not
only the pitch DOF, but also the yaw DOF that enables the movement
of the toe while the femur is under constraint in the sitting posture.
The open-sphere joint in the shoulder enables the joint to have a wide
range of motion by adhesion of muscle and bones. These structures
allowed the robot to achieve human-like behavior and contribute to
increased flexibility. The skeletal structure of Kenshiro is mainly made
of machined aluminum alloy (A5052). For several parts that require
three-dimensional (3D) complex form, we made those parts by 3D
printing. For example, covers and blade bone are made of acrylonitrile
butadiene styrene (ABS) plastic and stainless steel [420SS, bronze
(40%)] respectively. The ribs are made by lost wax casting process with
aluminum (AC4C) material.
A muscle actuator is composed of an electrical motor, mechanical
parts, a wire, and sensors, which are mechanically assembled and
modularized for easy use. We arranged these over the entire body
of Kenshiro to achieve muscle arrangements similar to those of
humans. Motors are blush-less dc (BLDC), and the output of those
is 100 W for almost all muscles and 40 W for narrow parts of the
body. Muscle length, tension, and temperature can be obtained from
the sensors. The wire in the muscle actuator is wound by a motor to
replicate muscle contraction. It is a chemical wire named Dyneema,
which is strong against friction. Planar muscles that replicate the planar
surfaceofhumanmuscleswereusedinthespineandneckjoints.Interms
of muscle control, the behavior of muscle actuators can be made similar
to human muscle behavior by implementing artificial motor controls
inspired by the characteristics of human muscles. We also implemented
muscle-tendon complex control to provide muscle flexibility (35) and
muscle cooperation for sharing load over redundant muscles (36).
Balance control was implemented by using distributed force sen-
sors and human-like joint structures on the body. We implemented a
balancing strategy for the musculoskeletal humanoid that relied on
muscle tension and the spine (37). To control the musculoskeletal
humanoid, a muscle Jacobian that expresses the relationship between
muscle length and joint angle is necessary. A machine learning–based
approach to obtain the muscle Jacobian was proposed, and it enabled
bidirectional conversion between the muscle length and joint angle (38).
To overcome large robot-model errors, learning using real sensor data,
but not simulation data, is preferable.
Development of Kengoro
In the design process of Kengoro, we adopted the idea of multi-
functional skeletal structures to achieve both humanoid performance
and human-like proportions and devised sensor-driver–integrated
muscle modules for improved muscle control. Figure 5 shows the body
specifications of Kengoro. To demonstrate the effectiveness of these body
structures, we conducted several preliminary movements using Kengoro.
Kengoro is the successor version of Kenshiro and is also a human
mimetic humanoid designed with anatomical fidelity to humans
(39). One of the design goals of Kengoro was to achieve actions in-
volving contact with the environment that required a flexible body
and adaptability to the environment. Thus, multi-DOFs in not only
the spine, but also in end effectors are important, because humans
naturally contact the environment with their hands and feet. On this
basis, Kengoro was equipped with human mimetic five-fingered
hands and feet. The foot has multi-DOFs and multisensors to facil-
itate natural adaptation to the ground (40). The toe actuation was
powerful enough to perform tip-toe standing with support by hands
for balancing. The toe is actuated by a muscle connected to a 90-W
motor placed on the lower leg link. In addition, the hand can hold the
weight of its body, because a large grasping force can be generated by
the muscles in its forearm (41). The forearm is composed of a radio-
ulnar joint with a tilted joint axis and expands the variety of possible
hand motions, such as that in sports or dexterous tasks (42). From a
physiological point of view, a skeletal structure with artificial perspi-
ration was developed to release the heat of the motors (43). The skel-
etal structure of Kengoro is composed of a combination of extra
super duralumin (A7075) and carbon fiber–reinforced plastic for
more strength and lightness. Several parts of the body, such as the
outer cover, were made by 3D printing, as with Kenshiro. LiFe bat-
teries were embedded into the skeletal structures of legs, and they
enabled movement for about 20 min without any power cables.

 Muscle control using force was achieved using two types of sensor-
driver–integrated muscle modules (42, 44). This is an all-in-one integrated
module composed of electrical motor, motor driver, and sensors for
force control. Motors were BLDC and those outputs were 90, 100, or
120 W for fundamental muscles. For narrow parts of the body. such
as the forearm, 60-W BLDC motors were adopted. The use of this
module provided active flexibility to Kengoro. Not only muscle space,
but also joint-space torque controller for flexible and adaptive environ-
mentalcontact wasimplemented (45). On the basisof human reciprocal
innervation that suppresses co-contraction in muscle antagonism,
we implemented antagonist inhibition control that contributed to
arm movement in a wide range of motions (46).
