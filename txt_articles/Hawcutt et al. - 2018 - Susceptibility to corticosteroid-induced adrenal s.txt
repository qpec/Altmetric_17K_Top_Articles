Summary
Background A serious adverse effect of corticosteroid therapy is adrenal suppression. Our aim was to identify genetic 
variants affecting susceptibility to corticosteroid-induced adrenal suppression.
Methods We enrolled children with asthma who used inhaled corticosteroids as part of their treatment from 
25 sites across the UK (discovery cohort), as part of the Pharmacogenetics of Adrenal Suppression with Inhaled 
Steroids (PASS) study. We included two validation cohorts, one comprising children with asthma (PASS study) 
and the other consisting of adults with chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD) who were recruited from 
two UK centres for the Pharmacogenomics of Adrenal Suppression in COPD (PASIC) study. Participants 
underwent a low-dose short synacthen test. Adrenal suppression was defined as peak cortisol less than 350 nmol/L 
(in children) and less than 500 nmol/L (in adults). A case-control genome-wide association study was done with 
the control subset augmented by Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium 2 (WTCCC2) participants. Single 
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that fulfilled criteria to be advanced to replication were tested by a random-
effects inverse variance meta-analysis. This report presents the primary analysis. The PASS study is registered in 
the European Genome-phenome Archive (EGA). The PASS study is complete whereas the PASIC study 
is ongoing.
Findings Between November, 2008, and September, 2011, 499 children were enrolled to the discovery cohort. Between 
October, 2011, and December, 2012, 81 children were enrolled to the paediatric validation cohort, and from 
February, 2010, to June, 2015, 78 adults were enrolled to the adult validation cohort. Adrenal suppression was present 
in 35 (7%) children in the discovery cohort and six (7%) children and 17 (22%) adults in the validation cohorts. In the 
discovery cohort, 40 SNPs were found to be associated with adrenal suppression (genome-wide significance p<1 × 10–⁶), 
including an intronic SNP within the PDGFD gene locus (rs591118; odds ratio [OR] 7·32, 95% CI 3·15–16·99; 
p=5·8 × 10–⁸). This finding for rs591118 was validated successfully in both the paediatric asthma (OR 3·86, 95% CI 
1·19–12·50; p=0·02) and adult COPD (2·41, 1·10–5·28; p=0·03) cohorts. The proportions of patients with adrenal 
suppression by rs591118 genotype were six (3%) of 214 patients with the GG genotype, 15 (6%) of 244 with the AG 
genotype, and 22 (25%) of 87 with the AA genotype. Meta-analysis of the paediatric cohorts (discovery and validation) 
and all three cohorts showed genome-wide significance of rs591118 (respectively, OR 5·89, 95% CI 2·97–11·68; 
p=4·3 × 10–⁹; and 4·05, 2·00–8·21; p=3·5 × 10–¹⁰).
Interpretation Our findings suggest that genetic variation in the PDGFD gene locus increases the risk of adrenal 
suppression in children and adults who use corticosteroids to treat asthma and COPD, respectively.

Introduction
Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are recommended for adults 
and children with asthma and for chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD).1–4 Although ICS are generally 
well tolerated and have fewer systemic adverse effects 
than do oral corticosteroids,5 some patients can still 
develop systemic adverse effects. Adrenal suppression is 
a clinically important adverse effect, particularly in 
children with asthma, in whom the diagnosis of adrenal 
suppression can be challenging because presentation can 
range from asymptomatic biochemical changes to non-
specific lethargy to florid adrenal crisis and death.
Several tests are available to assess adrenal function. 
The low-dose (1 µg) short synacthen test is the most 
widely used and correlates with the insulin tolerance test 
in adults.6 In children, the thresh 
old for diagnosing 
adrenal suppression with the low-dose short synacthen 
test has been based on adult reference values (peak 
cortisol <500 nmol/L), but data suggest that, in patients 
treated with ICS, a threshold of peak cortisol less than 
350 nmol/L might be more appropriate to identify 
clinically significant adrenal impairment.7
Interindividual variation in susceptibility to adrenal 
suppression is striking. Baseline and peak cortisol levels

in children with asthma treated with corticosteroids 
vary with age and sex.8 Although higher doses of 
corticosteroids are associated significantly with lower 
baseline and peak cortisol values,8–10 at a population level, 
the reduction in peak cortisol seen with increasing 
total dose of corticosteroids is small (<1 nmol/L per 
200 µg/day).8 However, symptomatic adrenal suppres 
sion 
has been reported at doses as low as 200 µg of inhaled 
beclometasone per day,11 and one in three children with 
asthma using corticosteroids has a peak cortisol lower 
than 500 nmol/L.8 Adrenal suppression is also seen in 
adults with asthma and COPD treated with ICS.5 The 
reasons for the interindividual variability in both adults 
and children remain unclear, because clinical factors only 
account for a small proportion of the variance.8
Previous pharmacogenomic studies in patients with 
asthma using corticosteroids have focused on efficacy.12 
As far as we know, no studies examining the pharma-
cogenomics of corticosteroid-induced adrenal suppression 
have been reported. The aim of the Pharmacogenetics of 
Adrenal Suppression with Inhaled Steroids (PASS) study 
was to undertake a pharmaco 
genomic assessment of 
factors predis 
pos 
ing to corticosteroid-induced adrenal 
suppression among children with asthma using ICS as 
part of their treatment. Validation was undertaken in both a 
paediatric asthma cohort (enrolled to the PASS study) and 
an adult COPD cohort (enrolled to the Pharmacogenomics 
of Adrenal Suppression in COPD [PASIC] study).
Methods
Participants
We recruited participants to the PASS study from 25 sites 
across the UK. We included children aged 5–18 years with 
asthma using ICS as part of their treatment (discovery 
cohort) and later recruited more children to a validation 
cohort. Full eligibility criteria have been published 
previously.7 Study participants in all paediatric cohorts 
were recruited either prospectively (if a low-dose short 
synacthen test had not yet been undertaken) or 
retrospectively (if the low-dose short synacthen test had 
already been done). The appendix presents further details 
of the recruitment strategy used for the PASS study, 
including the sample size calculation to set the recruitment 
target. We used single nucleotide poly 
morphism (SNP) 
array data from the Wellcome Trust Case Control 
Consortium 2 (WTCCC2) cohort as population control 
data for the genome-wide association case-control analysis. 
We included a second validation cohort, which 
comprised adults aged 18 years or older with COPD and 
using ICS who were recruited from two sites in the UK 
for the PASIC study. Full eligibility criteria are included 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed up to Jan 1, 2018, with the terms (“Adrenal 
suppression” OR “Adrenal insufficiency”) AND “corticosteroid” 
AND (“asthma” OR “Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease” OR 
“COPD”) AND (“Pharmacogenetics” OR “Pharmacogenomics” OR 
“polymorphism”), for studies investigating any association 
between host genetic factors and susceptibility to adrenal 
suppression. We found no peer-reviewed publications 
investigating pharmacogenomic variants associated with peak 
cortisol in patients being treated with corticosteroids for asthma 
and COPD. However, several publications examined the relation 
between corticosteroid efficacy and genetic polymorphisms.
Added value of this study
As far as we know, this is the first pharmacogenomic study to 
investigate the association between a patient’s genotype and 
corticosteroid-induced adrenal suppression. A polymorphism 
in the PDGFD gene locus was identified in a cohort of children 
with asthma in a genome-wide association study and found 
to be associated with adrenal suppression. This finding was 
validated in another paediatric asthma cohort and in a cohort 
of adults with chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder 
(COPD). A meta-analysis of the cohorts showed genome-wide 
significance.
Implications of all the available evidence
Our data support the idea of a link between interindividual 
variation in susceptibility to corticosteroid-induced adrenal 
suppression and a patient’s genotype, potentially through 
variation in the PDGFD gene locus. This finding offers the 
potential to develop translational pathways to prevent 
corticosteroid-induced adrenal suppression, thereby 
improving the benefit–risk ratio of this important therapy.

in the appendix. All adult participants were recruited to 
the study at the time the analysis of the PASS discovery 
cohort was undertaken.
The PASS study received ethics approval from 
Liverpool Paediatric Research Ethics Committee. The 
PASIC study received ethics approval from North West 2 
Research Ethics Committee (Liverpool Central). All 
participants gave written informed consent.
Procedures
To test adrenal suppression, we did the low-dose short 
synacthen test procedure as described previously.8 The 
appendix contains full details for all low-dose short 
synacthen tests and their interpretation. We defined 
adrenal suppression with cutoffs for peak cortisol of less 
than 500 nmol/L (in adults) and less than 350 nmol/L 
(in children).
For the genotype analysis, we obtained either whole-
blood samples (maximum of 10 mL in EDTA tubes) or 
saliva samples (2 mL) for DNA extraction. Extraction 
methods are detailed in the appendix. We did genotype 
analysis of DNA samples from children in the discovery 
cohort at Edinburgh Genomics (The Roslin Institute, 
University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK) on the 
Illumina Human OmniExpressExome-8v1 BeadChip 
using the Infinium HD Super assay (Illumina, San Diego, 
CA, USA). All data from the discovery cohort will be 
made available via the European Genome-phenome 
Archive (EGA). We did genotype analysis of samples 
from the paediatric asthma and adult COPD validation 
cohorts using Taqman allelic discrimination assay 
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Paisley, UK). WTCCC2 
controls underwent genotype analysis on a custom 
Illumina Infinium chip. The appendix contains further 
details on genotyping, quality control, and imputation.
Statistical analysis
The appendix contains full details of statistical analyses. We 
did genome-wide case-control analyses with cutoffs for 
peak cortisol from the low-dose short synacthen test of less 
than 500 nmol/L and less than 350 nmol/L. To test for 
associations between every SNP in turn and case-control 
status, we fitted a logistic regression model in SNPtest 
 
version 2.4.1 (University of Oxford, Oxford, UK), assuming 
an additive genetic model. We also adjusted for population 
substructure (appendix). We calculated Q-Q plots of 
phenotypes to test for genomic inflation, with λ values 
(ratio of median of observed distribution to median of 
expected distribution) indicating genomic inflation.13 
We identified significant SNPs using Manhattan plots 
(appendix). We did secondary analyses within the discovery 
cohort to test for association with peak and baseline cortisol 
levels as continuous phenotypes. We used LocusZoom 
version 0.4.8 (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, 
USA) to visualise genome-wide association analyses.
We did two meta-analyses of SNPs selected for validation 
(appendix) in meta-analysis helper (METAL; University of 
Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA).14 Meta-analyses were 
done to determine the true effect sizes of polymorphisms 
more accurately. The first meta-analysis was done for the 
two paediatric cohorts using the peak cortisol less than 
350 nmol/L phenotype, and the second was for all 
three cohorts combined using peak cortisol less than 
500 nmol/L phenotype. 
We compared our data with those from the CORtisol 
NETwork (CORNET) consortium genome-wide associ-
ation meta-analysis15 to ensure that the polymorphisms 
identified were not associated with variation in cortisol in 
patients not exposed to corticosteroids. The association 
between rs591118 and morning plasma cortisol was 
investigated in 12 studies that participated in the discovery 
and replication stages of CORNET and in four additional

studies that joined the CORNET consortium later. Full 
details of these datasets are shown in the appendix. We 
used MAGENTA version 2.4 (Broad Institute, MA, USA)16 
to scrutinise the results from all phenotypes to identify 
any enrichment of functional and biological pathways 
(appendix).
Role of the funding source
The funding source had no role in study design, data 
collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of 
the report. ALJ, BF, DBH, and MPi had access to raw 
data. The corresponding author had full access to all the 
study data and had final responsibility for the decision to 
submit for publication.
Results
Between November, 2008, and September, 2011, 
499 children were enrolled to the discovery cohort. 
Character 
istics of these patients, including those 
categorised as showing adrenal suppression, are shown 
in table 1. 92 (18%) children failed genotype quality 
control, of whom 19 did not meet sample call-rate criteria, 
five failed the sex check, nine did not meet identity-by-
descent criteria, and 59 were excluded as population 
outliers after principal component analysis; none failed 
the heterozygosity rate check (appendix). Therefore, 
407 were included in the genome-wide association study. 
In total, 951 117 SNPs were genotyped; 654 246 SNPs 
passed the predefined genotyping quality-control criteria, 
of which 430 492 overlapped with WTCCC2 SNPs.
Figures 1–4 display Q-Q plots for the four phenotypes—
namely, peak cortisol less than 350 nmol/L (figure 1B), 
peak cortisol less than 500 nmol/L (figure 2B), 
continuous peak cortisol (figure 3B), and continuous 
baseline cortisol (figure 4B). No genomic inflation was 
evident in the genome-wide association study for the 
phenotypes peak cortisol less than 500 nmol/L (λ=0·99), 
peak cortisol less than 350 nmol/L (λ=1·03), or 
continuous peak cortisol (λ=0·99). However, genomic 
inflation was noted for the continuous baseline cortisol 
phenotype (λ=1·22). Because of the rigorous quality-
control procedures applied to the dataset, the common 
causes of genomic inflation—eg, undetected sample 
duplications, unknown familial relationships, a poorly 
calibrated test statistic, systematic technical bias, or gross 
population stratification—were eliminated. Therefore, 
because the cause of genomic inflation was unknown, 
the p values in the analysis of the baseline phenotype 
were adjusted for genomic inflation. 
Figures 1–4 also show Manhattan plots for the four 
phenotypes. 51 SNPs were identified initially as notionally 
statistically significant (p<1 × 10–⁶) for the phenotype peak 
cortisol less than 350 nmol/L (figure 1A), with four SNPs 
identified for the phenotype peak cortisol less than 
500 nmol/L (figure 2A), 23 identified for the phenotype 
continuous peak cortisol (figure 3A), and 16 identified for 
the phenotype baseline cortisol (figure 4A).  
SNPs that were notionally statistically significant 
(p<1 × 10–⁶) in the analyses of association with each 
phenotype in turn are shown in table 2, together with the 
genetic region and information on whether the SNP was 
genotyped or imputed. In total, 60 SNPs were identified 
in 18 genes across the phenotypes. SNPs in PDGFD were 
the only variants associated with more than one pheno-
type (peak cortisol <500 nmol/L and <350 nmol/L). The 
ranking of p-value associations was undisturbed for the 
top 20 SNPs when the analysis was repeated after 
excluding the WTCCC2 control group (appendix).
The LocusZoom plot of regions on chromosome 11 
where PDGFD is located (appendix) suggested a true 
signal. The interaction analysis between the phenotype 
peak cortisol less than 350 nmol/L and rs591118 SNP was 
not significant (p=0·24) indicating that the interaction

between drug dose and SNP is unlikely to be associated 
with outcome. A similar linkage disequilibrium structure 
was noted in the LocusZoom plot of the TRPA1 gene 
located in chromosome 8. LocusZoom plots for genes 
other than PDGFD and TRPA1 were not supportive of a 
true signal in terms of the linkage disequilibrium 
structures seen.
In view of the association identified with PDGFD SNPs 
and evidence of biological plausibility (appendix), this 
gene was selected for investigation in the validation 
cohorts. Further analysis of this region of PDGFD 
and the phenotype peak cortisol less than 350 nmol/L, 
without the WTCCC2 controls and adjusted for 
significant clinical factors, showed that the signal was 
robust (appendix). The individual PDGFD SNP selected 
to be genotyped in the validation cohorts was rs591118, 
which had a significant association with the peak cortisol 
less than 350 nmol/L phenotype (odds ratio [OR] 7·32, 
95% CI 3·15–16·99; p=5·8 × 10–⁸).
Between October, 2011, and December, 2012, 81 children 
with asthma were recruited to a paediatric asthma 
validation cohort. A further validation cohort of adults 
with COPD were recruited between February, 2010, and 
June, 2015. Characteristics of these two validation cohorts 
are shown in table 1. Validation was done initially in the 
paediatric asthma cohort. Analyses of rs591118 and case-
control status with the phenotypes peak cortisol less than 
500 nmol/L (OR 2·12, 95% CI 1·03–4·37; p=0·04) and 
less than 350 nmol/L (3·86, 1·19–12·50; p=0·02) were 
significant. In the adult validation cohort, analysis of the 
association between rs591118 and the prespecified 
phenotype peak cortisol less than 500 nmol/L was 
significant (OR 2·41, 95% CI 1·10–5·28; p=0·03). Peak 
cortisol responses were generally lower in individuals 
who had the GG genotype at rs591118 (appendix). A peak 
cortisol response of either less than 350 nmol/L 
(children) or less than 500 nmol/L (adults) was achieved 
by six (3%) of 214 participants with the GG genotype, 
15 (6%) of 244 with the AG genotype, and 22 (25%) of 
87 with the AA genotype. 
By comparison with CORNET consortium data, 
which comprised the extended CORNET cohort of 
24 467 individuals of European ancestry, no evidence was 
found that genetic variation at rs591118 was associated 
with morning plasma cortisol (mean difference per 
A allele 0·002 SD, SE 0·008; p=0·80). 16 pathways were 
included in the pathway analysis that contained the 
PDGFD gene. Two pathways were identified that were 
associated with a false-discovery rate-corrected p value less 
than 0·05 (appendix). Meta-analysis of the two paediatric 
cohorts was significant for the phenotype peak cortisol 
less than 350 nmol/L (OR 5·89, 95% CI 2·97–11·68; 
p=4·3 × 10–⁹; figure 5A), and meta-analysis of all three 
cohorts for the peak cortisol less than 500 nmol/L 
phenotype was also significant (OR 4·05, 95% CI 
2·00–8·21; p=3·5 × 10–¹⁰; figure 5B).
Discussion
The findings of our genome-wide association study, 
examining genetic factors associated with corticosteroid-
induced adrenal suppression in children with asthma 
treated with predominantly ICS, showed that common 
variants in the PDGFD gene (eg, rs591118) were 
associated with the development of adrenal suppression. 
The findings were validated in another group of 
children with asthma and in a group of adults with 
COPD and the rs591118 variant was found to have 
genome-wide significance in both. The validation in the 
adult cohort is especially remarkable since these people 
were suffer 
ing from a different complex disease, had 
multiple 
comorbidities, 
and 
were 
on 
multiple 
medications, further reinforcing our novel finding. 
Heterogeneity was higher (44%) with the meta-analysis

of the COPD cohort compared with the asthma 
cohort (0%), which could reflect heterogeneity of the 
underlying disease.
The SNP rs591118 is an A→G substitution in an 
intronic region of the PDGFD gene. Analysis of the 
Genotype-Tissue Expression Portal17 shows that this 
variant does not alter PDGFD expression, but does have a 
score of 3a on RegulomeDB,18 suggesting that rs591118 
might affect transcription factor binding. However, 
further fine-mapping will be needed to identify 
definitively the causal variant. A search of the National 
Human Genome Research Institute Genome-Wide 
Association Study catalogue on Aug 14, 2017, showed that 
this particular SNP has not been associated with any 
disease or trait. The only associations with other variants 
within PDGFD of genome-wide significance (p<5 × 10–⁸) 
have been reported with coronary artery disease and 
myocardial 
infarction 
(rs974819, 
rs2128739, 
and 
rs2019090), with linkage disequilibrium 0·03 or less.19,20

are required for development of steroid-producing cells 
in many organs, including the testes, ovaries, and adrenal 
cortex.22 Moreover, PDGFD is highly expressed in human 
adrenal gland,23,24 unlike PDGFA, PDGFB, and PDGFC, 
and the expression of PDGFD correlates negatively with 
cortisol secretion in adrenocortical adenomas.25 However, 
our analysis does not suggest that the rs591118 SNP is a 
marker of constitutional variation in cortisol production 
because it was not associated with morning plasma 
cortisol levels among steroid-naive individuals in the 
CORNET consortium.15
We considered whether PDGFD genotype might affect 
asthma or COPD severity, and hence corticosteroid dose 
used in the patients. Although PDGFB  is associated with 
alterations in airway remodelling in asthma,26 a link to 
PDGFD has not been made. Several polymorphisms have 
been associated with development and severity of asthma 
and COPD,27–29 but none are in PDGFD. Also, poly-
morphisms in PDGFD have not been identified as 
affecting efficacy of corticosteroid treatment.12 Taken 
together, these data suggest that patients with adrenal 
suppression attributable to PDGFD variants do not have 
more severe asthma or reduced response to ICS. 
Genetic variation in the PDGFD gene might determine 
responsiveness of the adrenal gland to corticotropin 
rather than susceptibility to suppression of cortico-
tropin production, but either of these mechanisms is likely 
to be important in determining susceptibility to clinically 
significant corticosteroid-induced adrenal suppression.
Although we have focused on the PDGFD locus, 
and identified the potential biological reasons for 
the involvement of PDGFD in corticosteroid-induced 
adrenal suppression, it is possible that the actual gene 
predisposing to this phenotype might be located distantly 
from rs591118. Therefore, laboratory and human 
experi 
mental studies will be needed to understand whether 
variation at the PDGFD locus affects adrenal function.
What is the clinical significance of our finding? The 
minor allele frequency for rs591118 is 0·44,30 and the 
current prevalence of childhood asthma is 11%,31 
meaning that roughly 2% of all children (276 000 in the 
UK and 1·58 million in the USA) will have both asthma 
and be homozygous for rs591118. For COPD, 1·2 million 
and 11 million adults in the UK and USA, respectively, 
have the disease, with about 232 000 in the UK and 
2 130 000 in the USA homozygous for the SNP. Children 
homozygous for the minor allele of rs591118 who have 
asthma and use ICS are nearly six times more likely to 
develop adrenal suppression than are children who have 
asthma and use ICS who are homozygous wild-type. 
Similarly, adults homozygous for the minor allele of 
rs591118 who have COPD and use high-dose ICS are 
four times more likely to develop adrenal suppression

than are adults who have COPD and use ICS who are 
homozygous wild-type. Corticosteroids are used to treat 
many disorders, not merely asthma and COPD. Future 
studies should, thus, assess other populations of 
patients treated with corticosteroids and investigate 
whether this SNP is associated with other corticosteroid 
adverse effects.
The possible clinical relevance of our study finding 
might lie in identifying individuals who would benefit 
from use of alternative treatments to ICS—eg, in 
paediatric asthma, leukotriene receptor antagonists. Our 
calculations show that 27 children with asthma, or 
12 adults with COPD, would need to be tested and put on 
an alternative therapy to avoid one case of adrenal 
suppression (appendix). However, this approach cannot 
be advocated without further studies, which might 
include a biomarker-stratified randomised controlled 
trial. An alternative scenario (if ICS are still needed) 
would be to identify patients who need more intensive 
monitoring of adrenal function. Whether both of these 
clinical interventions would be cost-effective is unknown, 
and would need to be built into future study designs.
A limitation of our study is the small sample size used 
for the genome-wide association study when compared 
with studies using genome-wide association to investigate

individual susceptibility to developing a complex disease. 
However, significant associations between genetic poly-
morphisms and serious adverse drug reactions that have 
led to changes in practice have previously been identified 
from small cohorts.32 We identified other genetic loci that 
did not reach genome-wide significance, including TRPA1 
(which we did not assess further), and a larger sample size 
might identify additional loci. Because the low-dose short 
synacthen test is a painful intervention, requiring cannu-
lation, we restricted paediatric recruitment to children in 
whom there was clinical suspicion of adrenal suppression. 
These inclusion criteria might mean we enriched our 
study population artificially, because clinicians will have 
selected children they perceived to be most at risk, but this 
approach is in keeping with clinical risk stratification. 
Finally, the small sample size may have affected the 
calculation for number needed to treat.
In conclusion, we have shown that a common variation 
in the PDGFD locus is associated with an increased risk 
of adrenal suppression. Our finding is highly novel, and 
its importance is emphasised by its validation in a 
multimorbid adult population with COPD. Further work 
is needed not only in larger patient cohorts to characterise 
the effect size of rs591118 with greater accuracy but also 
to define the functional mechanisms by which PDGFD is 
involved in corticosteroid-induced adrenal suppression.
