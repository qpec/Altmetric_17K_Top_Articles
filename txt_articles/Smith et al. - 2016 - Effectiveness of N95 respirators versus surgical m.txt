ransmission of acute respiratory infections 
occurs primarily by contact and droplet 
routes, and accordingly, the use of a surgi-
cal mask, eye protection, gown and gloves should 
be considered appropriate personal protective 
equipment when providing routine care for a pa-
tient with a transmissible acute respiratory infec-
tion.1–3 Concerns have been raised about possible 
acute respiratory infection spread via limited-
distance airborne transmission, but this is contro-
versial and has not been proven.1,4–9 Also, experi-
mental data suggest the superiority of N95 filtering 
facepiece respirators (N95 respirators) over surgi-
cal masks for the prevention of acute respiratory 
infections.1 Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) 
and observational studies comparing N95 respira-
tors and surgical masks have not shown a benefit, 
but they may have been underpowered.10–17
The lack of clarity has led to conflicting 
guideline recommendations regarding respiratory 
protective equipment for the prevention of acute 
respiratory infections: N95 respirators are recom-
mended in some guidelines but not others.18 
Since the outbreak of severe acute respiratory 
syndrome (SARS), there has been a heightened 
level of controversy within Canada in determin-
ing the optimal ways to protect health care work-
ers from respiratory pathogens. Conflicting rec-
ommendations from federal and provincial health 
authorities lead to confusion among heath care 
workers, which can result in lack of adherence to 
basic infection control principles and practices.

Background: Conflicting recommendations 
exist related to which facial protection should 
be used by health care workers to prevent 
transmission of acute respiratory infections, 
including pandemic influenza. We performed 
a systematic review of both clinical and surro-
gate exposure data comparing N95 respirators 
and surgical masks for the prevention of trans-
missible acute respiratory infections.
Methods: We searched various electronic data-
bases and the grey literature for relevant studies 
published from January 1990 to December 2014. 
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), cohort 
studies and case–control studies that included 
data on health care workers wearing N95 respi-
rators and surgical masks to prevent acute respi-
ratory infections were included in the meta-
analysis. Surrogate exposure studies comparing 
N95 respirators and surgical masks using mani-
kins or adult volunteers under simulated condi-
tions were summarized separately. Outcomes 
from clinical studies were laboratory-confirmed 
respiratory infection, influenza-like illness and 
workplace absenteeism. Outcomes from surro-
gate exposure studies were filter penetration, 
face-seal leakage and total inward leakage.
Results: We identified 6 clinical studies (3 RCTs, 
1 cohort study and 2 case–control studies) and 
23 surrogate exposure studies. In the meta-
analysis of the clinical studies, we found no sig-
nificant difference between N95 respirators 
and surgical masks in associated risk of (a) lab-
oratory-confirmed respiratory infection (RCTs: 
odds ratio [OR] 0.89, 95% confidence interval 
[CI] 0.64–1.24; cohort study: OR 0.43, 95% CI 
0.03 
–6.41; case–control studies: OR 0.91, 95% 
CI 0.25–3.36); (b) influenza-like illness (RCTs: OR 
0.51, 95% CI 0.19–1.41); or (c) reported work-
place absenteeism (RCT: OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.57–
1.50). In the surrogate exposure studies, N95 
respirators were associated with less filter pen-
etration, less face-seal leakage and less total 
inward leakage under laboratory experimental 
conditions, compared with surgical masks.
Interpretation: Although N95 respirators 
appeared to have a protective advantage over 
surgical masks in laboratory settings, our meta-
analysis showed that there were insufficient 
data to determine definitively whether N95 res-
pirators are superior to surgical masks in protect-
ing health care workers against transmissible 
acute respiratory infections in clinical settings.

CMAJ, May 17, 2016, 188(8) 
We performed a systematic review to assess 
and synthesize the available body of literature re-
garding N95 respirators versus surgical masks for 
the protection of health care workers against acute 
respiratory infections in a health care setting.
Methods
A detailed protocol developed a priori is described 
in Appendix 1 (available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/
suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.150835/-/DC1).
Literature search
We searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Database 
of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, the Coch-
rane Central Register of Controlled Trials, the 
Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, 
Health Technology Assessment, the Collective 
Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature, 
PsycINFO and Scopus for pertinent English-
language studies published from Jan. 1, 1990, 
to Dec. 9, 2014. (The search strategies are avail-
able in Appendix 1, Tables S1–S9.) The search 
start date marks 4 years before N95 respirators 
became a part of standard respiratory protective 
equipment among health care workers in the 
United States.
We also conducted searches of the grey litera-
ture to obtain unpublished data. These searches 
were limited to the past 5 years (see Appendix 1, 
Table S10, for search details).
Study selection
Randomized controlled trials, prospective and ret-
rospective cohort studies, and case–control studies 
were eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis. 
Participants in clinical studies were health care 
workers in a health care setting. We defined health 
care worker as any worker in a health care setting 
who might be exposed to a patient with an acute 
respiratory infection. We excluded studies that 
solely involved protection of patients or commu-
nity populations.
Surrogate exposure studies (i.e., experiments 
involving manikins or volunteers exposed to artifi-
cially produced aerosols) were not eligible for in-
clusion in the meta-analysis but were summarized 
to provide an overview of the laboratory-based ex-
perimental evidence for use of N95 respirators to 
protect against acute respiratory infections. Aero-
sols are defined as a suspension of very small 
(0.01–100 μm in diameter) particles or droplets in 
the air.19 Studies with manikins or adult volunteers 
exposed to an aerosol simulating what might occur 
in a health care setting were considered.
Study designs assessed the use of National 
Institute for Occupational Safety and Health 
certified N95 respirators compared with surgical 
masks. Certification must have been under pub-
lic health regulations (42 CFR part 84). Respira-
tors certified under the former regulations 
(at 30 CFR part 11) were ineligible because they 
are no longer in use.20 We also included data 
on  
European standard filtering facepiece 
(FFP2) respirators (standards EN149:2001 and 
EN149:2001+A1:2009) as data on N95 filtering 
facepiece respirators. We did not include data 
on elastomeric facepiece respirators because 
they are not in widespread use in health care set-
tings. The term “surgical mask” was considered 
equivalent to medical masks, procedural masks, 
isolation masks, laser masks, fluid-resistant 
masks and face masks that meet bacterial and 
particle filtration efficiency standards required 
by the US Food and Drug Administration 
(ASTM standard F2100–11) but are not certifi-
able as N95 respirators. Other types of respira-
tors and surgical masks not explicitly described 
here were excluded.
Data extraction and quality assessment
The primary outcome of interest from RCTs, 
cohort studies and case–control studies was 
laboratory-confirmed respiratory infection, 
including respiratory infections diagnosed by 
means of polymerase chain reaction, serology, 
respiratory virus culture and Bordetella pertussis 
bacterial culture. Secondary outcomes were 
influenza-like illness, and workplace absentee-
ism due to hospital-acquired respiratory infec-
tions. The outcomes extracted from surrogate 
exposure studies were filter penetration, face-
seal leakage and total inward leakage.
Two reviewers (J.D.S. and C.C.M.) indepen-
dently screened abstracts, titles and full texts as 
described in the selection of studies. Data extrac-
tion was conducted using an electronic spread-
sheet template (completed independently by 
J.D.S. and C.C.M.) and compared for discrepan-
cies. Data from surrogate exposure studies were 
transformed, when appropriate, from fit-factors, 
protection factors or filter efficiencies to penetra-
tion percentages. When necessary, one of us 
(J.D.S.) contacted authors for additional infor-
mation (Appendix 1, Table S11).
Randomized controlled trials were explicitly 
assessed for bias according to the Cochrane risk-
of-bias tool.21 Cohort and case–control studies 
were assessed for risk of design-specific bias 
using the relevant Newcastle–Ottawa Scale.22
Outcome-specific quality of the body of evi-
dence was assessed in duplicate by the same 
2 reviewers using the Grading of Recommenda-
tions Assessment, Development and Evaluation 
(GRADE) framework.23,24 Disagreements were 
resolved through consultation with a third reviewer 
 Research

(J.J.). The quality of evidence can be graded as 
high, moderate, low or very low.
Data synthesis
Where data could be combined for meta-
analyses, these data were reported as odds ratios 
(ORs). We combined similar study designs only 
for the meta-analysis. Data were measured on 
 
dichotomous outcomes (laboratory-confirmed 
respiratory infection, influenza-like illness and 
workplace absenteeism). A random-effects anal-
ysis model and inverse variance statistical 
method were used for meta-analysis using Re-
view Manager (RevMan).25
Cluster RCTs were adjusted for the meta-
analysis with individual RCTs. We used the in-
traclass correlation coefficient to determine the 
design effect.26 Design effect was used to deter-
mine the effective sample size.26 When the effec-
tive sample size was not a whole number, it was 
rounded to the nearest whole number.
For meta-analyses involving rare events, zero 
cell counts were adjusted by including a correc-
tion (the reciprocal of the size of the contrasting 
study arm).27
We assessed evidence of heterogeneity using 
the χ2 test and I2 statistic; a χ2 value less than 
0.10 or an I2 value greater than 50% indicated 
significant heterogeneity.28,29 Subgroup analysis 
was planned if there were more than 5 pooled 
studies and when significant heterogeneity was 
present.
All statistical analyses were performed with the 
use of RevMan (version 5.2; The Nordic Coch 
rane 
Centre, The Cochrane Collaboration, 2012).
Results
Search results and study characteristics
We screened 8962 titles, excluded 8855 and 
retrieved 107 articles for full-text assessment. 
We selected 31 eligible articles involving 29 
studies; 6 were clinical studies that we included 
in the meta-analysis, and 23 were surrogate 
exposure studies (Figure 1). No unpublished 
abstracts of RCTs, cohort studies or case–control 
studies were found.
We included 3 RCTs, 1 cohort study and 
2 case–control studies in the meta-analysis.11–17 
The main characteristics of these studies are found 
in Table 1. All 6 studies reported laboratory-
confirmed respiratory infection. Definitions of 
laboratory-confirmed respiratory infection dif-
fered. None of the RCTs used B. pertussis bac-
terial culture or viral culture. Neither of the RCTs 
by MacIntyre and colleagues12–14 used serology. 
The SARS cases in the cohort study15 and one of 
the case–control studies were confirmed only by 
serology.16 Zhang and colleagues17 confirmed 
influenza only by polymerase chain reaction. All 
of the RCTs reported on influenza-like illness. One 
RCT also reported workplace absenteeism; how-
ever, the outcome could not be confirmed to result 
from nosocomial respiratory infections.11
Effect on outcomes
No significant difference in risk of laboratory-
confirmed respiratory infection was detected be-
tween health care workers using N95 respirators 
and those using surgical masks in the meta-
analysis of the RCTs (OR 0.89, 95% confidence 
interval [CI] 0.64–1.24; I2 = 0%), the cohort study 
(OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.03–6.41) or the case–control 
studies (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.25–3.36; I2 = 0%) 
(Figure 2). Similar results were found in 2 post-
hoc meta-analyses: in one, we combined data 
from the 3 observational studies (OR 0.79, 95% 
CI 0.24–2.56; I2 = 0%); in the other, although not 
advised, we pooled data from all of the studies as 
an intellectual exercise to try to ascertain whether

(OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.64–1.21; I2 = 0%).
We found no significant difference in risk of 
influenza-like illness between N95 respirators 
and surgical masks in the meta-analysis of the 
3 RCTs (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.19–1.41; I2 = 18%) 
(Figure 2). We also found no significant differ-
ence in risk of workplace absenteeism between 
N95 respirators and surgical masks in the 1 RCT 
that measured this outcome11 (OR 0.92, 95% CI 
0.57–1.50) (Figure 2).
Risk of bias
The risk of bias for the RCTs is summarized in 
Figure S1 of Appendix 1. In brief, risk-of-bias 
ratings were identical across each domain of the 
Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for all included 
RCTs (low risk of bias for random sequence

Loeb and colleagues11 but as high risk of bias 
for the other 2 RCTs.12–14 
Risk of bias for the cohort and case–control 
studies is summarized in Table S12 of Appen-
dix 1. In brief, the cohort study15 received a rat-
ing of 6 stars, one of the case–control studies 
received 3 stars,16 and the other case–control 
study received 6 stars.17
Outcome-specific quality of evidence
The ratings of importance and outcome-specific 
quality of evidence that we assessed using the 
GRADE approach are summarized in Table S13 
of Appendix 1. In brief, laboratory-confirmed 
respiratory infection was deemed a critically 
important outcome for decision-making with 
low-quality evidence from RCTs, and an impor-
tant outcome for decision-making with very-
low-quality evidence from observational studies. 
Influenza-like illness was rated as an important 
outcome for decision-making with very-low-
quality evidence from RCTs. Work-related 
absenteeism was considered not an important 
outcome for decision-making with very-low-
quality evidence from 1 RCT.
We did not conduct subgroup analyses because 
no significant heterogeneity was detected. No 
meaningful sensitivity analyses could be per-
formed because too few studies were included.
Summary of surrogate exposure studies
Twenty-three surrogate exposure studies were 
included.30–53 Their outcomes and general meth-
ods (e.g., participants, particles used for expo-
sure, number and type of respirator or surgical 
mask used, flow rates and breathing rates of 
manikins, size of challenge particles and range 
of particle size measured) are summarized in 
Appendix 2 (available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/
suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.150835/-/DC1). In gen-
eral, compared with surgical masks, N95 respira-
tors showed less filter penetration, less face-seal 
leakage and less total inward leakage under the 
laboratory experimental conditions described.
Interpretation
Results of our systematic review and meta-
analysis show that there was no significant dif-
ference between N95 respirators and surgical 
masks when used by health care workers to pre-
vent transmission of acute respiratory infections 
from patients. However, wide 95% CIs from our 
meta-analysis must be interpreted as insufficient 
evidence to determine whether there is a clini-
cally significant difference. Findings from the 
surrogate exposure studies suggest that N95 res-
pirators are superior to surgical masks for filter 
penetration, face-seal leakage and total inward 
leakage under laboratory conditions.
It was not surprising to find that N95 respira-
tors were generally more efficient filters with bet-
ter face-seal characteristics than surgical masks 
when tested in the laboratory. However, transmis-
sion of acute respiratory infections is a complex 
process that may not be appropriately replicated 
by surrogate exposure studies. Because the face 
seal is important for the efficiency of the N95 res-
pirator, fit-testing is recommended for health care 
workers.2 N95 respirators are often considered 
 
uncomfortable for regular use, and improper 
wearing or adjustment of the respirator because of 
discomfort could lead to inadvertent face contami-
nation, thus negating the potential protective ben-
efit.54,55 Furthermore, we do not have an adequate 
understanding of the number, size and dispersion 
of the droplets that contain live, infectious parti-
cles produced by infected patients.56 A laboratory-
based study reported data that humans infected 
with influenza rarely produce aerosols that contain 
infectious viral particles.57 In 2 other laboratory 
studies, participants infected with influenza pro-
duced droplets containing viral RNA, but viral 
RNA could not be detected on manikin headforms 
or on filters of breathing manikins at distances as 
close as 0.1 m following participants breathing, 
counting, coughing or laughing.7
Limitations
Despite our study’s many strengths, including a 
comprehensive search strategy for published 
data and grey literature, and a thorough review 
and assessment for risk of bias and quality of 
evidence using validated tools, limitations of this 
review should be acknowledged.
None of the studies included in the meta-
analysis, except the RCT by Loeb and col-
leagues,11 independently audited compliance with 
the intervention. Potential confounding due to 
concurrent interventions (e.g., gloves, gowns and 
hand hygiene practices) as part of routine and 
additional precautions for droplet transmission 
were not accounted for by our meta-analysis. 
We did not assess the impact of harms associ-
ated with mask and respirator use that could neg-
atively affect the efficacy of the assigned inter-
vention because it was out of the scope of our 
review.55 
Acute respiratory infections may have been 
acquired during the study from community 
exposures rather than nosocomial exposure. In 
one of the RCTs,12,13 transmission may have 
occurred via contamination of provided respira-
tory protective equipment during storage and 
reuse of masks and respirators throughout the 
workday.

Only 2 respiratory virus seasons were 
assessed by the 3 RCTs; in one trial,14 the peak 
period of one of these influenza seasons was 
missed, and in another trial,11 the H1N1 outbreak 
in 2009 halted the study during the other respira-
tory season. Year-to-year strain variation of 
influenza necessitates additional data from other 
seasons during peak periods. 
The weighting of the meta-analysis was influ-
enced by the laboratory-confirmed respiratory 
infection outcome of serology used in one of the 
RCTs.11 However, health care workers who 
received influenza vaccination were appropriately 
excluded from analysis based only on serology. 
Bias due to lack of blinding in all studies was 
a key factor in the relatively low GRADE quality 
assessment, and it is impossible to overcome 
because the health care workers would know 
which mask they were wearing. 
Finally, these results are not generalizable to 
infections transmitted primarily through airborne 
routes (i.e., tuberculosis, measles and varicella) 
or to protection from acute respiratory infections 
during aerosol-generating medical procedures.3
Conclusion
Although N95 respirators appeared to have a pro-
tective advantage over surgical masks in labora-
tory settings, our meta-analysis showed that there 
were insufficient data to determine definitively 
whether N95 respirators are superior to surgical 
masks in protecting health care workers against 
transmissible acute respiratory infections in clini-
cal settings. Additional, large RCTs are needed to 
detect a potentially clinically important difference 
owing to small event rates. Initial guidelines on 
preventing acute respiratory infection relied on 
surrogate exposure data and data extrapolated 
from the protection of health care workers against 
tuberculosis because clinical evidence did not exist 
at that time.58,59 Randomized controlled trials con-
ducted in clinical settings represent the most valid 
information to evaluate the effectiveness of N95 
respirators. They are more relevant to real clinical 
situations and report actual outcomes in health care 
workers, and therefore they are the best evidence 
on effectiveness to inform policy-making.
