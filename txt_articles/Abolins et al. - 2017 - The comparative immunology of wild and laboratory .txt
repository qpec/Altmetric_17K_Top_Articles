The laboratory mouse is the workhorse of immunology, used as a model of mammalian
immune function, but how well immune responses of laboratory mice reflect those of
free-living animals is unknown. Here we comprehensively characterize serological, cellular
and functional immune parameters of wild mice and compare them with laboratory mice,
finding that wild mouse cellular immune systems are, comparatively, in a highly activated
(primed) state. Associations between immune parameters and infection suggest that high
level pathogen exposure drives this activation. Moreover, wild mice have a population
of highly activated myeloid cells not present in laboratory mice. By contrast, in vitro cytokine
responses to pathogen-associated ligands are generally lower in cells from wild mice,
probably reflecting the importance of maintaining immune homeostasis in the face of intense
antigenic challenge in the wild. These data provide a comprehensive basis for validating
(or not) laboratory mice as a useful and relevant immunological model system.

 M
ost of our understanding of the mammalian immune
system comes from detailed studies of inbred, laboratory-
adapted strains of the house mouse, Mus musculus
domesticus, but whether such responses are indicative of those of
free-living, outbred populations is unknown. Laboratory mice have
been genetically isolated from their free-living relatives for more
than
80
years
such
that
laboratory
strains
capture
only
a small part of the genetic variation present in wild populations1–3.
The genome of the laboratory mouse is a mosaic of the
M. musculus domesticus and Mus musculus musculus genomes4.
Laboratory mouse strains are also mostly genetically homozygous
often resulting in phenotypes caused by recessive alleles. Indeed,
major differences exist among inbred mouse strains in immune
phenotype and function, and resistance or susceptibility to
infectious or inflammatory diseases. Many of these traits have
been mapped to specific loss of function mutations in genes that
affect the immune response5.
The different genetic heritage of wild and laboratory mice is
obvious in other ways given that laboratory mice are larger and
heavier than, and differ in coat colour from, wild M. musculus
domesticus. In adaptation to the laboratory, mice have been selected
for rapid growth, early maturation, high fecundity and docility6 and
inadvertent selection for immunological traits is almost certain.
Equally important for immune function, laboratory mice typically
live in highly controlled and optimized environments, have
unlimited access to food and are kept free of pathogens; the
increasing trend towards housing animals in individually ventilated
cages further reduces exposure to environmental antigens. By
contrast, wild mice are continually exposed to environmental
antigens, are typically infected by numerous microparasites and
macroparasites, and face competition for resources (for example,
food, mates, safe nesting places). Wild mouse populations are
subject to continual selection in this very different antigenic and
physical
environment,
where
immune
responses
make
an
important contribution to their fitness.
Given these substantial differences between wild and laboratory
animals and their respective environments, differences between
their baseline immune parameters, immune responses to model
antigens
and
functional immune
competence are expected.
Understanding immune phenotype and function in wild mice is
essential for understanding immune responses of genetically
diverse, free-living populations, including humans7,8. Comparison
of the immune function of wild and laboratory mice is also
required to reveal both the utility and the limitations of laboratory
mice as broadly applicable and relevant immunological models.
Although immune function might be assumed to differ
between wild and laboratory mice, this assumption is based on
remarkably little empirical evidence; there are only four published
reports of the immune function of wild M. musculus domesticus
(refs 9–12). It is remarkable that mice—the central model used in
immunology—are so immunologically understudied in the wild.
In these studies, wild caught mice co-housed with laboratory
mice and immunized with either sheep red blood cells9 or keyhole
limpet haemocyanin10 developed higher anti-sheep red blood
cells and anti-keyhole limpet haemocyanin antibody responses
(greater lytic activity; and higher concentration and avidity,
respectively) than laboratory mice. Small scale, ex vivo flow
cytometric
studies
report
higher
proportions
of
activated
CD4 þ T cells, B cells, macrophages and dendritic cells in
spleens of wild mice compared to laboratory mice10, and skewing
of the natural killer (NK) cell population to a supposedly
less mature phenotype but with higher resting levels of NK cell
activation in wild mice compared with laboratory mice11. A
small-scale comparison of wild and pet mice with laboratory mice
found
that
the
non-laboratory
mice
had
more
antigen-
experienced CD8 þ T cells than laboratory mice, commensurate
with living in unsterile conditions12. Although these studies
support
the
idea
that
wild
and
laboratory
mice
differ
immunologically, the lack of an extensive, immune system-wide
analysis of populations of wild mice tempers this conclusion. It
therefore remains the case that the immune responses of wild
mice are essentially unknown and thus that the validity of
laboratory mice as a model immunological system is uncertain.
We have therefore undertaken a detailed phenotypic and
functional analysis of the immune systems of 460 wild mice
(M. musculus domesticus) from 12 sites in the southern UK,
comprising ten farms in the Bristol region, the island of
Skokholm (Pembrokeshire, south west Wales) and the London
Underground (Fig. 1a). The entire data set comprises (1) serum
concentrations of immunoglobulins (IgG and IgE) and acute
phase proteins (serum amyloid P and haptoglobin); (2) faecal IgA
concentrations; (3) ex vivo flow cytometric analysis of splenocytes
(proportions, absolute numbers and activation status of T cells,
B cells, regulatory T [Treg] cells, NK cells, dendritic cells and
myeloid cells); (4) multiplex bead array analysis of cytokine
production
after
in

stimulation
of
splenocytes
with
pathogen-associated
molecular patterns (PAMPs), including
CpG,
peptidoglycan
(PG)
and

and

Results
A community resource. The complete immunological data set of
460
wild
mice
is
provided
as
a
community
resource
(Supplementary Data 1). From this we compare in detail a subset
of 181 wild mice (100 male, 81 female) from a single site
(site HW, Fig. 1a, Supplementary Table 1) with 64 laboratory-
reared, pathogen-free C57BL/6 (24 male, 40 female) mice. The
results of this comparison are shown in Tables 1,2 and Supple-
mentary Table 2, the latter being too large to fit within the main
text of the article.
Wild mice are immunologically different from laboratory mice.
Serological and morphometric parameters for the wild (HW) and
laboratory (C57/BL6) mice are summarized in Table 1. The wild
mice were much smaller than the laboratory mice (weighing only
half as much) and among the wild mice, age, body length and mass
were all highly correlated (length and mass, Pearson correlations
(two-tailed) r ¼ 0.79; age and mass, rZ0.77; age and length,
r ¼ 0.58, Po0.001, n480 for male and female mice separately)
(Supplementary Data 2). The wild mice had a median age of 6.6
weeks (range 1–39.5) and many immune parameters correlated
with age and size, likely due to cumulative exposure to infection
(Supplementary Data 2). From 62 immunological measures
most (57 measures) differed between wild and laboratory mice
(Table 1, Table 2, Supplementary Table 2). Among the wild mice
there were very few (6 of 62 measures) significant immunological
differences between male and female mice, while the laboratory
mice were more (18 of 62 measures) immunologically sexually
dimorphic (Table 1, Table 2, Supplementary Table 2).
Multilocus genotyping shows that the HW wild mice are
an
unstructured,
genetically
diverse
population
(Fig.
1b,
Supplementary Data 3). The wild mice are genetically distinct
from ten laboratory mouse strains, and the laboratory strains are
more genetically diverse than are the wild mice. We suggest that
this genetic relationship between the wild and laboratory mice is
explained by the mosaicisim of laboratory mouse genomes4, by
the fact that laboratory mice have been deliberately separated
from each other for many generations, and by the fact that
laboratory strains are largely homozygous.

 Wild mice carry a substantial burden of infection. We screened
the wild mice for evidence of infection with viruses and Myco-
plasma pulmonis, and for evidence of ectoparasite and intestinal
nematode infection; suppliers confirmed the laboratory mice to
be infection free. The seroprevalence of the different microbial
infections ranged from 22% for minute virus to 92% for parvo-
virus (n ¼ 153 for both analyses; Supplementary Table 3). Wild
mice were commonly infected with the Oxyurid nematode
Syphacia spp. (prevalence 91%) and with the mite Myocoptes
musculinus (prevalence 82%) (n ¼ 181 in both cases). Infection
of wild mice was very common: all wild mice had been infected
with at least one pathogen and only 5% (8 of 153) were
seronegative for all the viruses and M. pulmonis. There was no
effect of sex on the intensity or prevalence of infection (Supple-
mentary Table 3).
Wild mice have very high concentrations of serum proteins.
In wild mice, serum concentrations of IgG and IgE were 20- and
200-fold higher, respectively, in wild mice than in the laboratory
mice (Fig. 2). Among wild mice, IgE concentrations were
significantly higher among females than among males (Table 1).
By contrast, faecal IgA concentrations did not differ significantly
between wild and laboratory mice (Fig. 2, Table 1). Wild mice
also had significantly higher serum concentrations of the acute
phase
proteins,
serum
amyloid
P
component
(SAP)
and
haptoglobin than laboratory mice (Fig. 2, Table 1). These
differences
were
not
due
to
higher
total
serum
protein
concentrations in wild mice since concentrations of alpha-1
antitrypsin (AAT)—a stable component of normal serum—did
not differ between wild and laboratory mice (Fig. 2, Table 1).
Wild mice were more heterogeneous in their concentrations of
immunoglobulins and acute phase proteins compared with
laboratory mice (Fig. 2, Table 1, Supplementary Table 4).
Although baseline SAP concentrations are partially genetically
determined13, the significant correlation between SAP and
haptoglobin concentrations (Pearson correlations (two-tailed)
r ¼ 0.41, Po0.0001, r ¼ 0.33, P ¼ 0.004 for 96 males and
77 females, respectively; Supplementary Data 2) suggests that
inflammation and/or infection are the probable drivers of this
heterogeneity. Among wild mice, the serum concentrations of
IgG and IgE were significantly, positively correlated with age
(Pearson
correlation
(two-tailed)
r40.2,
Po0.05,
nZ79;
Supplementary Data 2) likely reflecting cumulative exposure to
infection. This can be seen explicitly for IgE concentrations which
were significantly positively correlated with the number of
microbial infections in male wild mice (Pearson correlation
(two-tailed) r ¼ 0.23, P ¼ 0.036, n ¼ 80; Supplementary Data 2).
In female wild mice, faecal IgA concentration was highly
correlated with the number of microbial infections and with
the number of mites (microbial infections Pearson correlations

Po0.0001,
n ¼ 35;

r ¼ � 0.380, P ¼ 0.01, n ¼ 45; Supplementary Data 2).
Wild mouse splenocytes differ from those of laboratory mice.
Spleens of wild mice were much smaller (approximately one third
the mass) than those of laboratory mice and contained significantly
fewer (approximately one fifth the number) viable mononuclear
leucocytes (Table 1). More surprisingly, the spleens of wild mice
were significantly proportionately smaller (that is, when compared
with body mass) than those of laboratory mice (Table 1).
Ex vivo flow cytometric quantification and characterization of
spleen cell populations (Figs 3–6, Supplementary Fig. 1) revealed
that the wild mice had lower absolute numbers of T cells, B cells,
NK cells, dendritic cells, macrophages and neutrophils than
laboratory mice, consistent with their lower absolute number of
splenic mononuclear cells (Supplementary Data 1). But, propor-
tionately, wild mouse spleens had significantly more T cells,
a higher T:B cell ratio and more CD11b þ myeloid cells, but fewer
NK cells and dendritic cells, than laboratory mice (Supplementary
Table 2); the ratio of CD4 þ: CD8 þ T cells was also significantly
higher in wild mice than in laboratory mice. These differences are
consistent with accumulation of T helper cells and phagocytic
cells in the spleens of wild mice in response to systemic infections.
The status of CD4 þ
and CD8 þ
T cells was markedly
different between wild and laboratory mice. For CD4 þ T cells
significantly greater proportions were effector/effector memory

 (CD62L � CD44hi) and central memory (CD62L þ CD44hi) cells
(and so proportionately fewer were naı
¨ve, CD62L þ CD44low), in
wild mice compared to laboratory mice (Supplementary Table 2,
Fig. 3a). Although proportions of CD4 þ T cells that were
Foxp3 þ CD25 þ Treg cells were marginally higher among wild
than laboratory mice (Supplementary Table 2, Fig. 3b), this was
insufficient to offset the much larger proportion of effector
CD4 þ T cells such that ratios of effector CD4 þ T cells to Tregs
were significantly higher among wild than laboratory mice
(Supplementary Table 2).
Similarly, for CD8þ T cells wild mice had a significantly higher
proportion of effector/effector memory (CD62L� CD44hi) and
terminally differentiated (KLRG1 þ) cells than did laboratory
mice (and so significantly lower proportions of naı
¨ve) (Fig. 3c,d).
Wild mice also had proportionately fewer central memory
(CD62L þ CD44hi) CD8þ T cells than laboratory mice; this
difference was due in part to the low frequency of these cells in
wild male mice (Supplementary Table 2), but may also reflect the
relative distribution of antigen-experienced CD8 þ T cells between
the memory and effector subsets. Again, the ratio of effector/
effector memory CD8 þ T cells to Tregs was significantly higher in
wild than laboratory mice (Supplementary Table 2).
Consistent with the idea that frequent or persistent pathogen
challenge drives expansion of antigen-experienced CD4þ and
CD8þ T-cell subsets in wild mice, there were significant positive
correlations between the proportions of effector CD4þ and CD8þ
T cells and age among female wild mice (Pearson correlations
(two-tailed) age and effector CD4þ r ¼ 0.62, Po0.0001, n ¼ 51;
age and effector CD8 þ r ¼ 0.49, Po0.0001, n ¼ 50; Supplementary
Data 2).
Interestingly,
these
parameters were
not
strongly
correlated with age in male wild mice (Pearson correlation (two-
tailed) ro0.1, P40.05, n ¼ 66) pointing to different immunological
strategies of male and female mice in the wild.
In contrast to the highly primed/effector status of splenic
T cells, CD19 þ B lymphocytes of wild mice predominantly had
a naı
¨ve phenotype. We categorized splenic CD19 þ B lympho-
cytes as naı
¨ve (CD38 þ IgD þ), memory (CD38 þ IgD � GL7 �)
or germinal centre (CD38lo IgD � GL7hi) cells14, and identified
recently activated, antigen-experienced cells by their MHC class II
expression and binding of peanut agglutinin (PNA; indicating
expression of the PNA receptor, PNA-R)15 (Fig. 4a). Despite their
very high serum immunoglobulin concentrations, spleens of wild
mice contained significantly higher proportions of naı
¨ve B cells
(and, reciprocally, significantly lower proportions of memory
B cells) than the laboratory mice (Fig. 4b,c). This initially
counter-intuitive observation probably reflects reallocation of
antigen-experienced B cells from the spleen to the bone marrow,
to other lymphoid tissues, or to sites of infection, together with
continual repopulation of the spleen by naı
¨ve, bone marrow-
derived B cells. Wild mice had proportionately more germinal
centre B cells in their spleens than did laboratory mice and
PNA binding was comparatively higher on all B-cell subsets in
wild
mice,
consistent
with
recent
activation15
(Fig.
4d,
Supplementary Table 2). Together these results point to high
turnover of activated CD19 þ B cells in wild mouse spleens.
Wild mice have a hitherto unknown myeloid cell population.
We next identified myeloid cells as CD11bþ CD11c � (Fig. 5a)
and analysed their expression of F4/80 and Ly6G, revealing four
subpopulations of F4/80þ cells, denoted M1–M4 (Fig. 5b–d).
These include F4/80 þ Ly6G� (M1) tissue resident macrophages,
F4/80 þ Ly6Glow (M2) monocytes/red pulp macrophages and
F4/80þ / �Ly6Ghigh (M4) polymorphonuclear cells (PMN). The
M4 PMN population could be further divided into neutrophils and
myeloid-derived suppressor cells based on their forward and side

The table shows the body characteristics and serum protein concentrations for wild and laboratory mice, shown as medians (range; n). Statistical results show comparisons between sex within animal
source (that is, laboratory or wild mice), and between animal source. Where there exists a significant difference between sex, mice were grouped by sex and animal source as: laboratory female,
laboratory male, wild female and wild male (LF, LM, WF, WM, respectively), with Kruskal–Wallis H-tests (and post hoc, Dunn–Bonferonni, pairwise comparisons) conducted with significant differences
reported. Where data were normal (that is, body length, body mass and spleen mass: body mass ratio) or could be transformed to normal (log10 transformation of age; untransformed data shown), the
results of univariate GLMs are reported. All non-normal data were analysed by Mann–Whitney U-tests, unless stated otherwise. Asterisks denote significant differences as *Po0.05, **Po0.01,

 scatter characteristics (Fig. 5e). Importantly, in wild, but not in
laboratory, mice, we identified an additional population of F4/80 þ
cells expressing levels of Ly6G that are intermediate between
monocyte/macrophages and PMN (M3). As far as we are aware,
this is a novel population of cells not previously described, which
we have termed hyper-granulocytic myeloid cells (HGMC) on the
basis of their forward and side scatter characteristics (Fig. 5c–e).
Although there are some slight differences in levels of Ly6G
expression between the M2 and M3/M4 populations in wild and
laboratory mice (Fig. 5c) back gating of each population on CD11b,
CD11c,
and
forward
and
side
scatter
confirmed
that
the M2 populations in wild and laboratory mice are otherwise
identical
and
that
the
Ly6Ghigh
population
in
laboratory
mice is equivalent to the M4 population in wild mice (Fig. 5d).
Comparison of the side scatter for each population also confirms
that the high side scatter, hypergranulocytic M3 population is
indeed seen only in wild mice (Fig. 5f). The functional significance
of these cells is as yet unknown, but their discovery emphasizes that
study of laboratory mice does not necessarily reveal the full
armamentarium of the immune system.

The table shows the natural killer cell populations for wild and laboratory mice, shown as medians (range; n). Statistical results show comparisons between sex within animal source (that is, laboratory or wild
mice), and between animal source. Where there exists a significant difference between sex, mice were grouped by sex and animal source as: laboratory female, laboratory male, wild female and wild male
(LF, LM, WF, WM, respectively), with Kruskal–Wallis H-tests (and post hoc, Dunn–Bonferonni, pairwise comparisons) conducted with significant differences reported. All non-normal data were analysed by
Mann–Whitney U-tests, unless stated otherwise. Asterisks denote significant differences as *Po0.05, **Po0.01, ***Po0.001. Superscripts define cell populations as a percentage of: 1spleen cells; 2NK cells.

 Wild mice not only had proportionally more CD11b þ
CD11c � myeloid cells in their spleens than did laboratory mice
but,
within
the
myeloid
population,
PMN
and
HGMC
were enriched at the expense of macrophages and monocytes
(Fig. 5a,f, Supplementary Table 2). The expansion and/or
accumulation of neutrophils and HGMC in spleens of wild mice
is consistent with recent or current exposure to infection in
wild mice. Splenic CD11c þ dendritic cells were proportionately
rarer in wild mice compared with laboratory mice (Fig. 5g,
Supplementary Table 2).
Wild mouse NK cells are highly activated. We characterized
NKp46 þ CD3e � NK cells (Fig. 6) as early (stage 1), mid
(stage 2), late (stage 3) or fully (stage 4) mature cells by expression
of CD27 and CD11b (Fig. 6a). Wild mice had higher proportions of
stage 1 and stage 2 cells and lower proportions of stage 3 and stage
4 splenic NK cells, resulting in significantly higher ratios of early/
mid-stage NK cells to late/mature NK cells than laboratory mice
(Fig. 6b, Table 2). Expression of the recent/early activation marker
CD69 was higher on all subsets of wild mouse NK cells compared
with laboratory mice (Fig. 6c, Table 2) but—other than on stage 1
cells—expression of the KLRG1 terminal differentiation marker
tended to be lower (Fig. 6, Table 2). Together, these data are
consistent with activation, self-renewal and homeostatic expan-
sion16, and hence higher rates of turnover, of splenic NK cells of
wild mice compared with laboratory mice.
We next explored the expression of the Ly49 family of C type
lectin regulatory receptors on NK cells (Fig. 6e–h) reasoning that
stochastic expression of Ly49 receptor family members on individual
NK cells combined with population genetic diversity could lead to
NK cell heterogeneity within an individual and extensive variation in
NK cell phenotype among individuals11. Inhibitory Ly49 receptors
recognize self-MHC class I and prevent NK cells from killing healthy
cells, whereas Ly49 receptors that recognize pathogen associated
ligands lead to NK cell activation and killing of infected cells; the best
described example of this is binding of Ly49H to the murine
cytomegalovirus (MCMV) m157 glycoprotein which mediates
protective immunity to MCMV (ref. 17).
We analysed the expression of two activating receptors
(Ly49D and Ly49H) and one inhibitory receptor (Ly49G2). For
most C57BL/6 laboratory mice, NK cells expressed Ly49D, Ly49G
and Ly49H (Fig. 6e–h) with 5–45% of NK cells expressing each of
the receptors, consistent with previous reports18. In contrast very
few wild mice had any Ly49H þ NK cells (10%, n ¼ 125, Z1% of
Ly49H þ cells, Supplementary Data 1), suggesting that the gene
encoding this receptor is rare in this wild mouse population or
that allelic variation precludes recognition by the anti-Ly49H
antibody. We genotyped mice at the Ly49h locus for a deletion
that is associated with susceptibility to MCMV (ref. 17), finding
that 18% of the wild mice were homozygous for this deletion
(95% confidence interval 9.5–30%, n ¼ 98 mice from HW site;
frequency of deletion allele 0.42 assuming Hardy–Weinberg
equilibrium). This likely partially contributes to the scarcity of
Ly49H þ NK cells among wild mice, but raises questions about
the presence of additional null alleles at the Ly49h locus, and
whether other receptors can compensate for the lack of Ly49H in
wild mice, especially given the high prevalence of MCMV in the
wild mouse populations, reported to be 62 and 79% (refs 19,20).
The apparent absence of Ly49H among the wild mice may
explain their much more frequent expression of the alternative
activating receptor Ly49D and suggests that there may be
important differences between wild and laboratory mice in the
contributions of NK cells to functional immunity.
We identified three populations of Ly49G2 cells: Ly49G2 �,
Ly49G2low and Ly49G2high (Fig. 6g). Among wild mice most
Ly49G2 þ cells were Ly49G2low, whereas in laboratory mice
Ly49G2high cells predominated. This suggests the presence of
different alleles at the Ly49G2 coding locus in the wild and
laboratory populations. Among laboratory mice, interstrain

 differences in Ly49G receptor expression have been linked to
allelic variation in promoter activity21 and may influence the
threshold for NK cell activation18. These data support the idea
that there is extensive, hitherto undocumented, allelic diversity
among Ly49 receptors with likely important consequences for
NK cell function in the wild.
We wanted to understand the balance of expression of
activating and inhibitory Ly49 receptors on NK cells, and
so compared the proportions of NK cells expressing or not
Ly49D and Ly49G2 (Fig. 6e). Wild mice had significantly
higher proportions of Ly49D þG � cells than laboratory mice
whereas laboratory mice had significantly higher proportions of
Ly49D �G þ cells than wild mice (Table 2), suggesting that
NK cells of wild mice may have a lower threshold for activation,
although this will be heavily influenced by MHC class I genotype
and expression of other Ly49 receptors not assayed here.
Together these results show that NK cells of wild mice can be,
and are, much more readily activated than those of laboratory
mice, which may be a necessary response to the high pathogen
load of the wild environment.
Wild mice have reduced cytokine responses to PAMPs. In light
of the highly activated state of the cellular immune system of wild
mice we measured the functional immune response by culturing
splenocytes in the presence of PAMPs (CpG, the ligand for
endosomally expressed TLR9; PG, a TLR2 agonist; bacterial
LPS, a ligand for TLR4) and a mitogen (monoclonal antibodies
to the T-cell surface molecules CD3 and CD28). Among
the 45 comparisons made between wild and laboratory mice
(5 culture conditions � 9 cytokines) only 16 significant differ-
ences between wild and laboratory mice were observed, and in
13 of these analyte concentrations were significantly lower in the
wild mice (Fig. 7, Supplementary Data 1, Supplementary Table 5).
Of particular note, wild mice produced significantly less IL-12
(p40 and p70) and less IL-13 than laboratory mice in response to

 pathogen-related ligands and there was also a trend for IL-10
production to be lower in wild mice, although this was only
significant at baseline. These comparatively depressed cytokine
responses are in significant contrast to the highly activated cel-
lular immune state of wild mice. We speculate that some form of
innate immune tolerance may be operating to limit the degree of
inflammation in chronically and highly pathogen-exposed wild
mice. The only cytokine responses that were significantly higher
in wild mice than in laboratory mice were the IFN-g, IL-4 and
MIP-2a responses to anti-CD3/anti-CD28, which are consistent
with the higher proportions of memory and effector T cells in
wild mice. These results suggest that innate cytokine responses,
and their functional effects, may need to be re-evaluated in
laboratory mice.
Discussion
Laboratory mice are the mainstay of experimental immunology
and underpin work that has had a transformative effect on
human and animal lives through vaccination and, more recently,
immunotherapy. As the human population ages, understanding
immune-mediated disease and immunosenescence is of ever
increasing importance. For laboratory mice to be useful in
understanding these processes, and for treatments and therapies
to be effectively translated into human populations, we need to
appreciate both the strengths and limitations of the model. Given
that the ultimate purpose of the immune system is to provide
protection from external environmental threats, the environment
in which the immune system is studied is a priori likely to have
profound effects on its response. The rationale for this work was
therefore to understand the immune systems of mice in their
natural environment.
This uniquely extensive and detailed immune characterization
of wild mice shows that their immune systems are highly
activated and antigen-experienced, likely because wild mice are
continuously exposed to high levels of environmental antigenic
challenge, have high levels of infection and high cumulative
exposure to infection over their, often remarkably short, lives. By
complete contrast, innate immune function—as measured by
cytokine secretion in response to pathogen-associated ligands—is
remarkably similar between highly infected wild mice and
pathogen-free laboratory mice and, where there are differences,
the responses of wild mice are suppressed. We suggest that this
suppression of the innate immune response in the wild mice is
also driven by their very high levels of antigen exposure, as
a
homeostatic
mechanism
to
prevent
immune-mediated
pathology. These observations somewhat go against the emerging
concept of ‘trained immunity’ or ‘innate immune memory’—that

such

responses
upon
a subsequent encounter with the same or similar stimuli22. It is
also notable that we have identified a novel cell population in wild
mice—which we have termed hypergranulocytic myeloid cells—
that are apparently absent from laboratory mice. Further work is
needed to understand the role of these cells in immune defence
and immune regulation. Also of particular interest is our
observation of the high frequency of a deletion in the gene
coding for the NK cell surface receptor Ly49H. Studies using
laboratory mice have shown that deleting this gene results in
lethal susceptibility to certain strains of MCMV (ref. 17).
However, many naturally occurring strains of MCMV have
mutations that abrogate binding to Ly49H, and such mutations
can rapidly be selected for by serial passage of MCMV through
mice bearing Ly49H (ref. 23) indicating that control of diverse
strains of MCMV in the wild may be mediated by a number of
different pathways. Our results also suggest that there may be
much wider functional diversity in NK cells in wild mice than has
hitherto been indicated by studies in laboratory mice.
The status of the immune systems of wild and laboratory mice
therefore appears very different. Our data are consistent with the
immune systems of wild mice dynamically responding to a large
and ever changing diversity of antigens: wild mice seem to be
constantly immunologically multi-tasking. In contrast, laboratory
mice are likely responding to a very limited antigenic repertoire,
allowing greater immunological focus. A typical laboratory mouse
experiment will introduce a single pathogen or antigen, often at

 a high dose and/or with an immune stimulating adjuvant, into an
immunologically naive animal. The immune system this antigen
encounters is in a largely antigen-inexperienced state, likely acting
at baseline cellular turnover rates. In contrast, the same pathogen or
antigen in a wild mouse would encounter an immune system that is
already highly active and responding to many other antigens. The
different states of the immune systems of wild and laboratory mice
are therefore predicted to quantitatively and/or qualitatively alter
the response to any given antigen. Further, in wild mice, there will
be considerable inter-individual differences in these responses.
Studies with laboratory mice therefore show what immune
responses are possible, but these are not necessarily the immune
responses that will actually occur in the real world. The immune
response observed in a laboratory mouse is thus just one example
of the myriad immune responses that can be generated by outbred,
free-living individuals. Considerable caution should therefore be
exercised in extrapolating results from laboratory mice to free-
living animals and human populations. The research resource we
provide here will allow results obtained in laboratory mice to be
better contextualized, facilitating the translation of laboratory-based
studies to real-world populations.
Laboratory mice are ultimately derived from wild mice, but
have been subject to stringent selection during their laboratory
history which has, presumably, altered them in many ways. It is
likely that selection of laboratory mice for a range of life-history
traits (such as rapid growth and reproduction, and docility) has
resulted in alteration of a range of traits, including immunological
traits. This makes the important point that animals’ immune
responses need to be considered as one aspect of their wider range
of life-history traits, and truly understanding wild animals’
immune responses therefore needs to be embedded within the
wider context of their life-history biology.
While our work has characterized many immune parameters of
wild mice, further characterization (including ‘omics approaches,

 for example) is warranted to better understand their immune
function and its regulation. Although difficult to perform at scale,
sequential analyses of individual free-living animals would be
highly informative, as would immunization and infection studies
in wild mice. Of the commonly used laboratory mouse strains, the
C57/BL6 strain used here carries very few mutations that affect
immune responses5, with the notable exception of Slc11a1
(formerly Nramp1), which confers susceptibility to intracellular
bacterial infections; thus, comparison of wild mice with other
strains of inbred mice may also be informative. Of relevance to
future studies, we found that all of the immunological reagents
that we used (which were developed for use in laboratory mice)
were suitable for use in wild mice. Although genetic differences
between wild and laboratory mice, and among wild mice, may
affect the avidity of antibody reagents in no case did we find
laboratory reagents that failed to work in wild mice.
While much more remains to be done to fully understand
immune function in free living populations, these data provide
a sound basis for future studies on wild Mus musculus domesticus.
Most importantly, the marked among-individual heterogeneity of
immune parameters in wild mice provides a rich resource for
disentangling associations between genotype, environment and
phenotype, and how the immune response contributes to
evolutionary fitness.
Methods
Mice. This study was approved by the University of Bristol’s Animal Welfare and
Ethical Review Board. Specified pathogen-free C57BL/6 mice were obtained from
Charles River Laboratories (Margate, UK), Harlan (UK) or B&K Universal (UK)
and were housed in same-sex groups of five mice per cage, maintained in a 12 h
light/12 h dark cycle with environmental enrichment and were fed on commercial
rodent diet, ad libitum (EURodent diet 22%; PMI Nutrition International, LLC,
Brentwood, MO, USA).
Wild mice were live trapped at sites in the southern UK (Fig. 1, Supplementary
Table 1) using Longworth traps baited with rolled oats and carrots, left
overnight and inspected at least every 24 h (ref. 24). Trapped mice were transferred
to a conventional animal house for 2–7 days post capture and maintained
under the same conditions as the laboratory reared mice, except that they
were housed individually. Mice were trapped between March 2012 and
April 2014.
Mice were killed by intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital. Mice
were weighed, measured, and bled out by cardiac puncture and dissected. Blood
was collected into a heparinized container, centrifuged at 13,000g at 18 �C for
10 min and plasma was aliquoted and stored at � 20 �C. Spleens were aseptically
removed, weighed and single cell suspensions prepared by homogenization
through a 70 mm cell strainer (BD Biosciences); cells were counted by microscopy
using a haemocytometer and live cells enumerated by trypan blue exclusion25. Eye
lens mass was used to determine age according to the formula described
elsewhere26.
Infections. We determined the intestinal parasite and ectoparasite fauna of the
wild mice as described in ref. 24. We assayed each mouse for evidence of microbial
infection using ImmunoComb kits (50MTV103 and 50MIC103, Biogal Galed Labs,
Israel), an ELISA-based product to detect antibodies to Corona, Mouse Hepatitis,
Sendai, Minute, Noro and Parvo viruses and to M. pulmonis. However, because
mouse hepatitis virus is a corona virus and the manufacturer’s data sheet lacked
clarity as to the antigens used in the assay, corona virus data were excluded to avoid
over estimation of the number of viruses present in any particular sample.
Genotyping. Genomic DNA was extracted from 5 mm tail tips which were
digested with 0.8 mg ml � 1 proteinase K (Life Technologies) in a digestion buffer
(30 mM Tris pH 8, 10 mM EDTA pH 8, 1% w/v SDS pH 8) for 12 h at 56 �C. The
resulting solution was treated with 0.4 mg ml � 1 RNAseA (Life Technologies),

 DNA was purified using standard phenol/chloroform extraction, precipitated in
ethanol, resuspended in TE buffer (1 mM EDTA pH 8, 10 mM Tris pH 8) and
quantified by Qubit (Life Technologies).
A total of 167 wild mice from site HW (Fig. 1, Supplementary Data 3) and two
C57BL/6 (designated L88 and L90) mice were genotyped at 1,168 autosomal loci
using the GoldenGate Mouse MD mouse chip (GT-18-131, Illumina) following the
manufacturer’s instructions. The loci on this chip were chosen to differentiate
C57BL/6 mice from other commonly used mouse strains. Technical replicates of
the laboratory mouse DNA (15 replicates per sample) indicated that the genotyping
error rate across the 2,336 nucleotides was o1%. Our genotyping of C57BL/6 mice
showed perfect concordance with published data (http://support.illumina.com/
array/array_kits/mouse_md_linkage/downloads.html) for this strain.
We constructed a pairwise distance matrix of the number of genotyped
nucleotide differences among individuals, and included reference genotypes
for other laboratory strains (C57BL/6J, NOD/Ltj, 129S1/SvlmJ, CBA/J,
AKR/J, FVB/NJ, C3H/HeJ, BALB/cJ, DBA/2J, SJL/J) provided by Illumina
(http://support.illumina.com/array/array_kits/mouse_md_linkage/
downloads.html). The distance matrix was then used to construct a nearest
neighbour joining tree in MEGA6 (ref. 27).
Serum protein ELISA. Serum concentrations of haptoglobin, SAP and AAT were
determined using in-house sandwich ELISAs. Briefly, 96-well microtitre plates were
coated with 50 ml per well of goat polyclonal anti-mouse haptoglobin (Immunology
Consultants Laboratory, Portland, USA; 1 in 4,000), rabbit polyclonal anti-SAP
(Calbiochem, Watford, UK; 1 in 6,000) or chicken polyclonal anti-AAT (Immu-
nology Consultants Laboratory, Portland, USA; 1 in 6,000) diluted in PBS coating
buffer and incubated overnight at 4 �C. Plates were washed twice with PBS-Tween
(0.05% v/v Tween-20 in PBS) washing buffer and blocked for 2 h at room
temperature with 1% w/v bovine serum albumin in PBS-Tween. The plates
were washed twice, 50 ml of each test serum (diluted 1 in 10,000–1,00,000 for
haptoglobin; 1 in 400 for SAP; 1 in 80,000 for AAT) in blocking buffer added to
duplicate wells, incubated overnight at 4 �C and washed. For analyte detection,
50 ml of affinity purified goat polyclonal antibody to SAP, haptoglobin or
AAT (Immunology Consultants Laboratory, Portland, USA; biotinylated in-house
using NHS-LC-Biotin, Cayman Chemical Company Co, Ann Arbor, USA), diluted
to 0.1–0.5 mg ml � 1 in PBS-Tween, added to each well and incubated for 1 h at
room temperature. Plates were washed, incubated with 50 ml per well of strepta-
vidin-horseradish peroxidase (0.125 mg ml � 1; Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) in
PBS-Tween for 30 min at room temperature, washed again and developed with
100 ml per well of tetramethylbenzidine solution (Tebu-bio, Peterborough, UK) for
15–20 min in the dark at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by the
addition of 25 ml per well of 2 M H2SO4 and the plates were read at 450 nm
on a Dynex MRXII plate reader (Dynex Technologies, Worthing, UK).
SAP, haptoglobin and AAT concentrations were determined by interpolation
of optical density units for standard curves generated from purified
proteins or standards. SAP was purified from normal mouse serum using
phosphorylethanolamine-sepharose 4B affinity chromatography and anion
exchange (DE-52) chromatography, as previously described28. Standards
for haptoglobin and AAT were purchased from Immunology Consultants
Laboratory.
Serum IgG and IgE ELISAs were performed using Ready-SET-Go Kits
(88-50400 and 88-50460) from eBioscience (Hartfield, UK), following the
manufacturer’s instructions with the exception that we diluted the test samples
for the wild mice 1 in 400,000 for IgG and 1 in 200 for IgE respectively10.
Faecal IgA ELISA. Faeces were removed from the hindgut of mice, weighed and
dissolved in 50 ml PBS supplemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail at a final
concentration of 20% v/v (SIGMAFASTTM Protease Inhibitor cocktail Tablets,
EDTA-free) to form a slurry that was left at room temperature for 1 h. The samples
were then centrifuged at 13,000g for 10 min at 4 �C, and the supernatant removed.
The IgA concentration of these supernatants was measured using a commercially
available mouse IgA ELISA kit following the manufacturer’s instructions
(Mouse IgA ELISA Ready-SET-Go, 88-50450, eBioscience). Faecal supernatant
samples were serially diluted starting from a 1:500 dilution (in PBS with 1% v/v
Tween and 10% w/v BSA). Standard curves were constructed using the mouse
IgA supplied with the kit, and this was used to interpolate the IgA concentrations
in our samples expressed as the mg concentration per g of faeces.
Spleen cell cultures. Spleen cells were suspended in complete culture medium
(RPMI1640 supplemented with 10% v/v FCS, 100 U ml � 1 penicillin/streptomycin
and 2 mM L-glutamine; all Life Technologies, Paisley, UK) at a concentration of
1.5 � 106 cells per ml and 0.1 ml aliquots were dispensed into each well of 96-well
round-bottomed tissue culture plate (Greiner Bio-One, Stonehouse, UK). One of
the following stimulants (0.1 ml) was added to each well: anti-CD3/anti-CD28
(each at 5 mg ml � 1; eBioscience, Hartfield, UK), CpgG1826 (at 1 mg ml � 1;
MWG Eurofins, Ebersberg, Germany), PG (at 10 mg ml � 1; Sigma, Poole, UK),
LPS (2.5 mg ml � 1); 0.1 ml complete culture medium was used as a negative control.
Cultures were incubated at 37 �C in 5% CO2 for 15 h, centrifuged at 400g for 5 min
and approximately 0.15 ml of supernatant was removed, divided into two aliquots
and stored at � 80 �C until assayed for cytokines by bead array.
Flow cytometry. Freshly isolated spleen cells were stained for leucocyte surface
markers with intracellular staining for Foxp3 following permeabilization of cells25.
Samples were analysed on an LSR-II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) with FlowJo
software (Treestar, Ashland, USA). Details of the antibodies and their combination
into staining panels are provided in Supplementary Table 6. Gating strategies for
lymphocyte subpopulations are shown in Supplementary Fig. 1.
Ly49h genotyping. To complement the flow cytometry analysis of Ly49 markers,
we genotyped mice at the Ly49h locus (also known as Klra8 (ref. 29)), where a
deletion has previously been associated with inducing susceptibility to mouse
cytomegalovirus infection18. We genotyped 98 randomly selected HW mice at the
Ly49h locus by PCR as described in ref. 30 using primer pair D6Ott174 that lies
within the putative deletion (such that non-amplification indicates the mouse is
homozygous for the deletion) combined with amplification using the primer pair
D6Ott175 as a control for amplification of this locus. We used DNA from control
mice, specifically C57BL/6 and B65.BXD8 without and with the deletion30,
respectively, as controls.
Cytokine bead arrays. Cytokine concentrations in culture supernatants were
assayed using Bioplex Pro kits (M60-009RDPD & MD0-00000EL, Bio-Rad, UK)
following the manufacturer’s instructions, and analysed on a Luminex 100
(LuminexCorp, Austin, USA) running Bioplex Manager software. Initially
supernatants from 31 wild and 10 laboratory mice were analysed for 32 cytokines
and chemokines (Supplementary Data 4) and these data used to identify analytes
where concentrations above the assay’s limit of detection were observed in at least
some animals and where the data were not highly correlated with other analytes.
This resulted in the selection of nine highly informative analytes comprising IL-1b,
IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12p40, IL-12p70, IL-13, IFN-g and MIP-2a (Fig. 7). Data that
were below the assay’s range were set to values of 0.001 for the purposes of
statistical analyses.
Statistical analyses. Owing to technical or sample volume limitations, not
all parameters could be measured for all mice and thus sample sizes vary on
a test-by-test basis and are reported either alongside the data or in the degrees
of freedom. Data that were normally distributed (body mass; spleen mass:body
mass ratio) or that could be normalized (age; log10 transformed) were analysed
using general linear models. All other data were analysed using repeated
non-parametric tests (Mann–Whitney U tests, unless otherwise indicated).
The comparison of wild and laboratory mice compares 181 wild mice from site
HW and 64 laboratory mice (LMC 1–4, 9–41, 64, 65, 68–82, 85–93, 95)
(Supplementary Data 1).
Owing to the different sample sizes, and the differing proportions of male
and female mice between the laboratory and wild animal groups, separate,
univariate general linear models were used to analyse the effect of sex on
the age of wild mice and also the effect of animal group (that is, wild versus
laboratory) and the effect of sex within these groups on body mass and
spleen mass:body mass ratio. Mann–Whitney U tests were used to compare
spleen mass and viable spleen cell number between animal group and sex within
group.
The remaining variables were tested for any effect of sex within each animal
group. Where variables differed significantly by sex for either group, we divided the
mice into four groups: laboratory female, laboratory male, wild female and wild
male. Kruskal–Wallis H tests were then applied with post hoc pairwise comparisons
(Dunn–Bonferroni), controlling for Type I error inflation. Associations between
immunological and morphometric parameters among wild mice were assessed
by Pearson correlations (two-tailed) on untransformed data. Finally,
Mann–Whitney U tests were used to compare differences in cytokine production
between groups. All analyses were conducted in SPSS v.21 (IBM Corp., New York,
USA). Box plots were produced using R software via the website,
boxplot.tyerslab.com.
