Thyroid cancer development is driven by known point mutations
or gene fusions found in ∼90% of cases, whereas driver mutations
in the remaining tumors are unknown. The insulin-like growth factor
2 mRNA-binding protein 3 (IGF2BP3) plays an important role in can-
cer, yet the mechanisms of its activation in cancer cells remain poorly
understood. Using whole-transcriptome and whole-genome analy-
ses, we identified a recurrent fusion between the thyroid adenoma-
associated (THADA) gene on chromosome 2 and the LOC389473
gene on chromosome 7 located 12 kb upstream of the IGF2BP3 gene.
We show that THADA fusion to LOC389473 and other regions in the
vicinity does not result in the formation of a chimeric protein but
instead leads to strong overexpression of the full-length IGF2BP3
mRNA and protein, increased IGF2 translation and IGF1 receptor
(IGF1R) signaling via PI3K and MAPK cascades, and promotion of cell
proliferation, invasion, and transformation. THADA fusions and
IGF2BP3 overexpression are found in ∼5% of thyroid cancers that
lack any other driver mutations. We also find that strong IGF2BP3
overexpression via gene fusion, amplification, or other mechanisms
occurs in 5 to 15% of several other cancer types. Finally, we provide
in vitro and in vivo evidence that growth of IGF2BP3-driven cells and
tumors may be blocked by IGF1R inhibition, raising the possibility
that IGF2BP3 overexpression in cancer cells may predict an anti-
IGF1R benefit.

enome-wide sequencing analyses offer a valuable tool for
better understanding of genetic mechanisms of tumorigenesis
and identifying new therapeutic targets for cancer. Such approaches
have led to identification of driver mutations in the majority of
thyroid cancer cases (1, 2). They confirmed that point mutations
and gene fusions leading to the activation of the MAPK and PI3K/
AKT signaling pathways are crucial for tumorigenesis and pro-
gression of these tumors. Among papillary thyroid carcinomas
(PTCs), the most common type of thyroid cancer, ∼75% of tumors
have driver point mutations, whereas ∼15% show nonoverlapping
chromosomal rearrangements typically leading to the activation of
receptor tyrosine kinases (1). Driver point mutations or gene fu-
sions in the remaining PTCs remain unknown.
Typically, oncogenic chromosomal rearrangements result in an
in-frame fusion of a 5′ portion of an actively transcribed gene to a
functionally important 3′ portion of an oncogene, frequently cod-
ing for the kinase domain, leading to gene expression and consti-
tutive kinase activation (3). Other, less common mechanisms
include translocation of an oncogene to a region of actively tran-
scribed chromatin, leading to gene activation without formation of
the chimeric gene products (4–6). Such events are more difficult to
identify as biologically relevant during the analysis of next-gener-
ation sequencing data, because no typical in-frame fusion of two
coding gene sequences can be found. This may be responsible for a
failure to identify driver gene fusions in a significant proportion of
common cancers with currently unknown driver mutations (7).
In this study, we used whole-transcriptome (RNA sequencing;
RNA-seq) and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of PTCs to
identify recurrent fusions between the thyroid adenoma-associated
(THADA) gene on chromosome 2 and a genomic region on chro-
mosome 7 and demonstrate that it does not lead to the formation of
the chimeric protein but instead results in strong overexpression of
the downstream insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein
3 (IGF2BP3) gene, which is a transforming event in thyroid tumors
and a potential therapeutic target for IGF1 receptor (IGF1R) in-
hibitors in different cancer types.
Results
Identification of THADA–LOC389473 and THADA–IGF2BP3 Fusions. To
identify novel driver events in thyroid cancer, a prescreened group
of 25 PTCs lacking all known mutations was studied by RNA-seq
(21 tumors) or WGS (4 tumors) using paired-end sequencing on
an Illumina HiSeq system. Using RNA-seq, six tumors were found
to have gene fusions involving the THADA gene located on 2p21.
In four tumors (T1, T2, T3, and T5), RNA-seq results revealed
Significance
Thyroid cancer is the fastest-growing cancer type in the United
States, yet its molecular mechanisms are not fully understood.
Here we report the identification and characterization of a
gene
fusion
involving
the
thyroid
adenoma-associated
(THADA) and LOC389473 genes in papillary thyroid cancers,
which leads to strong overexpression of insulin-like growth
factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 3 (IGF2BP3) and signaling via
the IGF2/IGF1 receptor (IGF1R) pathway. As a result, we report
a previously unknown structural mechanism responsible for
IGF2BP3 overexpression in cancer. We also show that IGF2BP3
overexpression via different mechanisms can be found in 5 to
15% of several cancer types, and demonstrate that growth of
these tumors can be blocked by IGF1R inhibitors. This raises the
possibility that IGF2BP3 overexpression may be used to predict
therapeutic response to IGF1R inhibition in cancer cells.

GENETICS
 fusions between different exons (28, 29, 30, or 36) of THADA and
the noncoding region on 7p15.3 [chromosome (chr.) position
23,521,997] (Fig. 1A and SI Appendix, Table S1). This region is
located 12 kb upstream of the IGF2BP3 gene and appears to
contain a putative Homo sapiens gene, LOC389473. RNA-seq
analysis of the other two tumors revealed fusions between exon 30
of THADA and exon 3 of IGF2BP3 (T4) or between exon 31 of
THADA and exon 2 of IGF2BP3 (T6). All fusions were confirmed
by RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing (Fig. 1B and SI Appendix, Fig.
S1). In addition, upon manual inspection of RNA-seq reads for T4
with the THADA exon 30-to-IGF2BP3 exon 3 fusion, single reads
spanning THADA exon 30 and LOC389473 were also identified
and confirmed by RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing (SI Appendix,
Fig. S1). Using WGS, one additional tumor (T7) was found to
have a fusion between intron 31 of THADA and a region located
1.5 kb upstream of the IGF2BP3 gene (chr. position 23,511,508)
(Fig. 1A). The fusion was confirmed by PCR and Sanger se-
quencing of tumor DNA (Fig. 1D), and a reciprocal fusion was
detected (Fig. 1E), indicating that it is a result of a balanced
translocation between chromosomes 2 and 7. However, no chi-
meric mRNA involving THADA exon 31 fused with any of the first
four IGF2BP3 exons was detected by RT-PCR (SI Appendix, Fig.
S2). The t(2;7) rearrangement was further confirmed by FISH in
each of the five tumors studied (Fig. 1C and SI Appendix, Fig. S3).
THADA–LOC389473 Results in Overexpression of Downstream IGF2BP3.
The THADA–LOC389473 fusion places the partner genes in a
head-to-tail orientation and they transcribe in opposite directions,
so the fusion mRNA contains a stop codon downstream of the
fusion point in all four tumors (SI Appendix, Fig. S4), suggesting
that THADA–LOC389473 is unlikely to yield a functional protein.
This, together with finding the THADA–IGF2BP3 fusions in other
tumors, allowed us to hypothesize that THADA–LOC389473 may
affect carcinogenesis instead via altering the IGF2BP3 gene. To
test this, we first detected the expression levels of THADA and
IGF2BP3 in normal thyroid tissues and tumors by quantitative
(q)RT-PCR. The analysis showed that THADA was expressed at a
high level in normal thyroid follicular cells compared with other
cell types studied, and its expression was not altered in thyroid
cancers positive or negative for THADA fusions (Fig. 2A and SI
Appendix, Fig. S5). In contrast, IGF2BP3 was found to be
expressed at a very low level in normal thyroid cells and tumors
negative for the fusion, but its expression was increased 90- to 102-
fold in all tumors carrying the fusion (Fig. 2B). Similar findings
were observed in the RNA-seq data, which showed the increased
expression of the full-length IGF2BP3 mRNA in tumors positive
for THADA–LOC389473 and THADA–IGF2BP3 fusions (Fig. 2C
and SI Appendix, Fig. S5). Similarly, by Western blot analysis, all six
tumors studied showed high levels of IGF2BP3 protein of ∼69-kDa
molecular weight, corresponding to a full-length protein, and no
other protein products that would correspond to a chimeric gene
product (Fig. 2D). The analysis included tumors with THADA–
LOC389473 and THADA–IGF2BP3 fusions and a THADA intron
fused to a sequence 1.5 kb upstream of IGF2BP3. Further, im-
munohistochemical analysis with IGF2BP3 antibody showed strong
cytoplasmic immunoreactivity in all studied fusion-positive tumors
but not in adjacent normal thyroid tissue (Fig. 2E). These data
indicate that fusion between the THADA gene and LOC389473, a
predicted gene located 12 kb upstream of the IGF2BP3 gene, is
unlikely to produce a functional chimeric gene but instead results in
strong overexpression of the full-length IGF2BP3 transcript and

 protein, likely due to juxtaposition of the IGF2BP3 chromosomal
locus on 7p15.3 to the actively transcribed THADA locus on 2p21.
Overexpression of IGF2BP3 Leads to an Increase in IGF2 Protein and
Activation of the PI3K and MAPK Pathways. IGF2BP3 is known to
serve as a translational activator of IGF2 mRNA. Therefore, we
determined the expression of IGF2 mRNA and protein in thyroid
tumors positive and negative for THADA fusions. Using qRT-
PCR, no difference in IGF2 mRNA levels was detected (Fig. 3A).
This was confirmed by RNA in situ hybridization (ISH), which
showed low levels of IGF2 mRNA in the fusion-positive tumors,
similar to those seen in adjacent normal thyroid tissue, in contrast
to the high levels of IGF2BP3 mRNA in the fusion-positive tu-
mors (Fig. 3B). However, using Western blotting, a significant
increase in IGF2 protein was found in all tested tumors positive
for the fusion and IGF2BP3 overexpression (Fig. 3C).
IGF2 is known to act as an autocrine and paracrine regulator of
IGF1R (8, 9), leading to activation of the PI3K and MAPK sig-
naling pathways (9, 10). Therefore, we examined whether the in-
crease in IGF2 protein in these human tumor tissues was
associated with the increased phosphorylation of AKT and ERK
proteins. Using Western blot analysis, we showed increased pAKT
and pERK in all tumors positive for the fusion (Fig. 3C). The
effect of IGF2BP3 overexpression on IGF2 signaling was further
confirmed in vitro. Overexpression of IGF2BP3 in HEK293 cells
led to an increase in IGF2 protein, but not mRNA, and increased
phosphorylation of AKT and ERK proteins (Fig. 3 D and E). The
knockdown experiments were performed in PaCa-2 pancreatic
cancer cells, which have a very high level of IGF2BP3 expression,
based on the reference database for gene expression analysis
(Laboratory for Systems Biology and Medicine) (www.lsbm.org/
site_e/database/index.html), which we confirmed by Western blot
and immunohistochemistry (IHC) (Fig. 3 F and H). Knockdown of
IGF2BP3 using siRNA led to a significant reduction in IGF2
protein levels and decreased pAKT and pERK (Fig. 3 G and H),
confirming the impact of IGF2BP3 on translational activation of
IGF2 and its downstream signaling.
IGF2BP3 Overexpression Drives Cell Proliferation, Invasion, and
Transformation. To study the biological effect of THADA fusions
and IGF2BP3 overexpression in thyroid and other cell types, full-
length IGF2BP3 mRNA was overexpressed in FTC133, HEK293,
and U2OS cells, all with low levels of endogenous expression of
IGF2BP3. Overexpression of IGF2BP3 resulted in a significant
increase in proliferation in all three cell lines (Fig. 4 A–C). In a
reverse experiment, silencing of IGF2BP3 in PaCa-2 cancer cells,
which have high levels of IGF2BP3 expression, led to a signifi-
cantly reduced growth rate (Fig. 4D).
Next, we explored the impact of IGF2BP3 overexpression on
cell migration and invasion. Using a wound-healing assay,
IGF2BP3 overexpression in HEK293 cells led to a significantly
faster migration (Fig. 4E), whereas IGF2BP3 knockdown in
PaCa-2 cells resulted in decreased cell migration (Fig. 4F).
Similarly, a Matrigel invasion assay showed that overexpression
of IGF2BP3 in HEK293 cells led to a significant enhancement of
cell invasion, and knockdown of IGF2BP3 in PaCa-2 cells
resulted in reduced cell invasiveness (Fig. 4 G and H).
Finally, we studied the impact of IGF2BP3 overexpression on
cell transformation. Using a soft-agar colony-formation assay,
FTC133 thyroid cells transfected with IGF2BP3 vector showed a
significant increase in colony formation in the soft agar compared
with empty vector (Fig. 4I), indicating enhanced anchorage-
independent growth, a characteristic of transformed cells. In a
reverse experiment, knockdown of IGF2BP3 expression in PaCa-2
cancer cells resulted in a significant reduction of colony formation
in soft agar (Fig. 4J). Together, these data indicate that IGF2BP3
overexpression promotes cell proliferation, migration, invasion,
and transformation in thyroid and other cell types.
Frequency of IGF2BP3 Overexpression via Gene Fusion and Other
Mechanisms in Thyroid and Other Cancers. To evaluate the rate of
IGF2BP3 alterations in thyroid and other tumors, we first de-
veloped an IHC assay for specific and sensitive detection of
overexpression of IGF2BP3 protein in tumors carrying THADA–
LOC389473 and THADA–IGF2BP3 fusions. For this, IHC for
IGF2BP3 was titrated using 7 fusion-positive and 18 fusion-neg-
ative thyroid cancers to achieve strong and diffuse cytoplasmic
immunoreactivity in all positive cancers and complete absence of
immunoreactivity in fusion-negative cancers (SI Appendix, Fig.
S6A). Further, a targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) was
used for quantitative assessment of IGF2BP3 mRNA. Analysis of
192 PTCs, which represented a series of consecutive tumors with
this diagnosis analyzed by targeted NGS, revealed 10 (5.2%) cases
with strong IGF2BP3 immunoreactivity; all were confirmed to
have high levels of IGF2BP3 mRNA expression (SI Appendix, Fig.
S6B). Using RT-PCR, 9 out of the 10 (90%) tumors were positive
for a fusion, typically THADA–LOC389473. Rearrangement in-
volving the IGF2BP3 region was further confirmed by FISH in all
10 IHC-positive thyroid cancers (SI Appendix, Fig. S6C). This
demonstrated high specificity of the IHC assay in detecting tumors
with IGF2BP3 overexpression caused by chromosomal rear-
rangements. It also showed that chromosomal rearrangement in-
volving THADA fused to a chromosomal region upstream of
IGF2BP3 is a dominant mechanism of IGF2BP3 overexpression
in PTC.

GENETICS
 Next, we studied clinical and phenotypic features of thyroid
cancers that showed IGF2BP3 overexpression. These tumors
were characterized by slight female predominance (1.5:1), mean
patient age of 48.9 y, and tumor size ranging from 1.6 to 9 cm
(mean 3.8 cm). Despite the large tumor size, microscopically the
tumors were either encapsulated (n = 5) or well-circumscribed
(n = 5), with the follicular growth pattern characteristic of the
follicular variant of PTC or noninvasive follicular thyroid tumor
with papillary-like nuclear features (NIFTPs) (11) (SI Appendix,
Fig. S6D). None of them showed other common driver mutations
known to occur in thyroid cancer (e.g., BRAF, RAS), providing
additional evidence for THADA–LOC389473 and THADA–
IGF2BP3 fusions being a driver event in these tumors.
Further, we assessed the frequency of IGF2BP3 overexpression
and its mechanisms in other cancer types. Using the IGF2BP3
IHC assay to screen tissue microarrays of 12 common cancer
types, we found strong and diffuse immunoreactivity in 14.2% of
pancreatic cancers, 12.6% of lung squamous cell carcinomas,
10.1% of lung adenocarcinomas, 10% of gastric cancers, 9.7% of
cholangiocarcinomas, 9.1% of bladder cancers, 7.5% of ovarian
cancers, and 3.8% of colon cancers (SI Appendix, Fig. S6 E and F
and Table S2). Using FISH analysis of selected IHC-positive
cancers, chromosomal rearrangements involving the IGF2BP3
region were identified in 3/12 (25%) pancreatobiliary cancers (SI
Appendix, Fig. S6 F and G), and IGF2BP3 amplification in 3/18
(16.7%) IHC-positive lung adenocarcinomas, 1/8 (12.5%) pan-
creatic, and 1/5 (20%) bladder cancers (SI Appendix, Fig. S6 F and
H and Table S2). These findings are in agreement with the cancer
genome atlas (TCGA) data, where amplification of IGF2BP3 was
found in 0 to 7.1% of different cancer types (SI Appendix, Table S3).
This suggests that in addition to gene fusions, many nonthyroid
cancers have IGF2BP3 overexpression, which is likely due to
gene amplifications or other, possibly epigenetic, mechanisms
such as aberrant methylation (SI Appendix, Fig. S6I). Overall,
these data demonstrate that strong overexpression of IGF2BP3,
driven by gene fusions as well as other genetic and possibly
epigenetic mechanisms, occurs in a distinct subset of thyroid and
other cancer types.
Effects of IGF1R Inhibition on Growth of Cancer Cells Overexpressing
IGF2BP3. The data presented above indicate that IGF2BP3 over-
expression via chromosomal rearrangement and other mecha-
nisms occurs in a distinct subset of thyroid and other cancers and
results in an increase in IGF2 protein, signaling via IGF1R, and
cell proliferation, invasion, and transformation. Increased IGF1R
signaling has been linked to elevated cancer risk and more ag-
gressive behavior of different cancers, and pharmacological in-
hibitors of IGF1R, such as the small-molecule inhibitor OSI-906
(Linsitinib), are available (12, 13). Therefore, we tested the effects
of IGF1R inhibition on the growth of cancer cells driven by
IGF2BP3 overexpression. First, we studied whether activation of
the AKT and MAPK pathways and cell growth induced by
IGF2BP3 overexpression are affected by inhibiting IGF1R by
OSI-906 in vitro. Western blotting showed that inhibition of
IGF1R blocked phosphorylation of AKT, S6, and ERK induced
by IGF2BP3 overexpression in HEK293 cells (Fig. 5A). Further,
we found that inhibition of IGF1R by OSI-906 led to dose-dependent
growth inhibition of PaCa-2 cancer cells, which strongly over-
express IGF2BP3, but did not have any effects on FTC133 and
U2OS cells with low levels of IGF2BP3 expression (Fig. 5B).
However, when IGF2BP3 expression was induced in FTC133
and U2OS cells by transient transfection, both cell types

 acquired sensitivity to growth inhibition by OSI-906, and sub-
sequent inhibition of IGF1R returned the cells to an IGF2BP3-
negative–like
state
(Fig.
5C).
Similar
effects
of
IGF1R
inhibition were observed on migration and invasion of PaCa-2
cells (Fig. 5 D and E). Further, OSI-906 treatment of PaCa-2
cells led to significant reduction of colony formation in soft
agar (Fig. 5F).
To determine whether the inhibitory effect of OSI-906 on cell
proliferation is mediated by IGF2, we tested whether the in-
hibition of PaCa-2 cell proliferation following IGF2BP3 knock-
down can be rescued by IGF2. Indeed, the reduction in PaCa-2
cell growth by IGF2BP3 siRNA was reversed after supple-
menting the cell-culture medium with sufficient concentrations
of exogenous IGF2 (Fig. 5G).
Next, we explored whether growth of tumor cells overexpressing
IGF2BP3 can be blocked via IGF1R inhibition in vivo. We used
the pancreatic cancer cells PaCa-2 and colon cancer cells Caco-2,
both expressing IGF2BP3 at high levels (Fig. 5B), and the thyroid
cancer cells FTC133, with low levels of IGF2BP3 expression, to
establish tumors growing in nude mice at the sites of s.c. cell in-
jection. Treatment of mice with therapeutic doses of OSI-906
arrested growth of tumors originating from PaCa-2 and Caco-2
cells (Fig. 5H) but had no effect on the growth of FTC133-derived
tumors (Fig. 5I). As expected, the inhibitory effect on tumor
growth coincided with the reduction of phosphorylated IGF1R,
AKT, S6, and ERK in the tumor tissue (Fig. 5H), whereas tumors
originating from FTC133 and lacking IGF2BP3 expression did not
show reduction in the phosphorylation of these proteins (Fig. 5I).
These data show that growth of cancer cells overexpressing
IGF2BP3 can be arrested by IGF1R inhibitors in vitro and in vivo,
providing early evidence for a possible benefit of anti-IGF1R
therapy in cancers with strong overexpression of IGF2BP3 in-
duced by THADA–LOC389473 fusion or other mechanisms.
Discussion
In this study, we report the discovery and characterization of a
recurrent driver event in papillary thyroid cancer. The muta-
tional landscape of this tumor is dominated by point mutations
and gene fusions typically affecting genes coding for receptor
tyrosine kinases (RTKs) or intracellular effectors propagating
signals from RTKs via the MAPK and PI3K pathways (1). Here
we report a different class of mutations that indirectly affect the
expression of IGF2BP3, a gene coding for the IGF2 mRNA-
binding protein that acts as a posttranscriptional regulator of
IGF2 and via stimulation of the IGF1 receptor leads to the same
end points, namely activation of MAPK and PI3K signaling. The

were treated with either 50 mg/kg OSI-906 or an equal volume of vehicle daily by oral gavage. Data are shown as mean ± SEM. Representative pictures were
taken at day 10 of treatment of PaCa-2– and Caco-2–derived tumors and at day 7 of treatment of FTC133-derived tumors. Western blot analysis of xenograft

GENETICS
 prototypic molecular event leading to IGF2BP3 overexpression
discovered in this study is a fusion between the THADA gene
locus on 2p21 and a chromosomal region on 7p15 containing the
LOC389473 gene located upstream of the IGF2BP3 gene.
Chromosomal translocation t(2;7) has been previously reported
in thyroid tumors leading to the fusion of THADA to an un-
translated region on chromosome 7, prompting the authors to
suggest that its biological effects may involve disrupting the
function of THADA, a death receptor-interacting protein (14).
Here we show that this chromosomal translocation leads to strong
overexpression of the IGF2BP3 gene located downstream of the
fusion point. We were not able to identify THADA–IGF2BP3
fusion mRNA in the majority of these tumors, and instead ob-
served strong overexpression of the full-length IGF2BP3 mRNA
and protein. Although we cannot exclude that precursor fusion
mRNA and protein are made, it appears more likely that
IGF2BP3 up-regulation is due to the gene juxtaposition to the
THADA locus actively transcribed in thyroid cells. Such a mech-
anism of gene activation, although not common, is known to occur
as a consequence of chromosomal rearrangements in other tumor
types, particularly in hematological malignancies (5, 15, 16). Our
results support the possibility that in virtually all thyroid tumors
the fusion on the DNA level occurs upstream of the IGF2BP3
gene. However, this could not be confirmed directly in this study,
because in most tumors the fusions could be studied only at the
RNA and not at the DNA sequence level.
IGF2BP3 belongs to the family of IGF2-binding proteins that
regulate the expression of IGF2 and other proteins by binding to
target mRNAs and controlling their stability and translation (17,
18). It is expressed mostly during embryogenesis and retains no or
low expression levels in adult tissues (19, 20). IGF2BP3 has been
found to be overexpressed in several cancer types and to affect
tumor growth, cell transformation, and metastatic spread (18, 21,
22). However, the mechanisms responsible for IGF2BP3 over-
expression in those cancers remain poorly understood, with down-
regulation of let-7 microRNAs proposed as a possible factor (23).
Here we show that THADA–LOC389473 and other THADA
fusions upstream of the IGF2BP3 gene represent a previously
unknown structural mechanism responsible for IGF2BP3 over-
expression in thyroid and other cancer types.
Thyroid tumors positive for THADA fusions demonstrate a
distinct phenotype, as they tend to be large in size but fully en-
capsulated and showing low-grade morphology. In fact, some of
these tumors, previously designated papillary carcinomas, may
now be reclassified as more indolent, borderline tumors termed
NIFTPs (11). However, IGF2BP3 protein overexpression was
also observed in a subset of aggressive poorly differentiated
thyroid cancers (13). In addition to thyroid tumors, we detected
strong IGF2BP3 overexpression by IHC in ∼5 to 15% of other
cancer types. Further, we showed that strong overexpression of
IGF2BP3 led to posttranscriptional up-regulation of IGF2, ac-
tivation of IGF1R signaling, and increased cell proliferation,
migration, and transformation. Although we cannot exclude that
biological effects of IGF2BP3 overexpression may involve not
only IGF2 but other mRNA targets, our results provide evidence
that IGF2/IGF1R signaling is primarily responsible for biological
effects of IGF2BP3 overexpression in these cells.
Our data also suggest that growth of these cells and tumors
can be arrested either by blocking IGF2BP3 overexpression or by
IGF1R inhibition. This raises the possibility that IGF2BP3
overexpression may serve as a predictor of therapeutic response
to IGF1R inhibitors such as OSI-906 (24). Indeed, the IGF1R
pathway has been explored as a therapeutic target with either
anti-IGF1R antibodies or small-molecule inhibitors. However,
most trials showed no clinical benefit of targeting this pathway in
patients with advanced cancer (25). In trials that used small-
molecule inhibitors, such as OSI-906 (Linsitinib), which binds
dually to IGF1R and insulin receptor, clinical response was
registered only in a small (1 to 5%) but distinct proportion of
patients with solid tumors (24, 26). The results of this study
provide early, preclinical evidence that IGF2BP3 overexpression
may be used to predict therapeutic response to IGF1R inhibitors
in patients with various, frequently highly lethal cancer types,
which should be further explored in future studies.
Materials and Methods
Tissue samples were collected and deidentified according to the University of
Pittsburgh institutional review board-approved protocol. No patient consent was
required. Paired-end whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing was per-
formed on an Illumina HiSeq 2000. Cell-proliferation assays were performed
using alamarBlue. Matrigel invasion chambers were used for cell-invasion assays,
and soft-agar colony-formation CytoSelect Kits to assess transformation. Detailed
methods are provided in SI Appendix, Materials and Methods.
