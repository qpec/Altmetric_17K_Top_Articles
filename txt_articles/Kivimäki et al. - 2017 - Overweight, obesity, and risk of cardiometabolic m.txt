Summary
Background Although overweight and obesity have been studied in relation to individual cardiometabolic diseases, 
their association with risk of cardiometabolic multimorbidity is poorly understood. Here we aimed to establish the 
risk of incident cardiometabolic multimorbidity (ie, at least two from: type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, and 
stroke) in adults who are overweight and obese compared with those who are a healthy weight.
Methods We pooled individual-participant data for BMI and incident cardiometabolic multimorbidity from 
16 prospective cohort studies from the USA and Europe. Participants included in the analyses were 35 years or older 
and had data available for BMI at baseline and for type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, and stroke at baseline and 
follow-up. We excluded participants with a diagnosis of diabetes, coronary heart disease, or stroke at or before study 
baseline. According to WHO recommendations, we classified BMI into categories of healthy (20·0–24·9 kg/m²), 
overweight (25·0–29·9 kg/m²), class I (mild) obesity (30·0–34·9 kg/m²), and class II and III (severe) obesity 
(≥35·0 kg/m²). We used an inclusive definition of underweight (<20 kg/m²) to achieve sufficient case numbers for 
analysis. The main outcome was cardiometabolic multimorbidity (ie, developing at least two from: type 2 diabetes, 
coronary heart disease, and stroke). Incident cardiometabolic multimorbidity was ascertained via resurvey or linkage 
to electronic medical records (including hospital admissions and death). We analysed data from each cohort separately 
using logistic regression and then pooled cohort-specific estimates using random-effects meta-analysis.
Findings Participants were 120  813 adults (mean age 51·4 years, range 35–103; 71 445 women) who did not have diabetes, 
coronary heart disease, or stroke at study baseline (1973–2012). During a mean follow-up of 10·7 years (1995–2014), we 
identified 1627 cases of multimorbidity. After adjustment for sociodemographic and lifestyle factors, compared with 
individuals with a healthy weight, the risk of developing cardiometabolic multimorbidity in overweight individuals was 
twice as high (odds ratio [OR] 2·0, 95% CI 1·7–2·4; p<0·0001), almost five times higher for individuals with class I 
obesity (4·5, 3·5–5·8; p<0·0001), and almost 15 times higher for individuals with classes II and III obesity combined 
(14·5, 10·1–21·0; p<0·0001). This association was noted in men and women, young and old, and white and non-white 
participants, and was not dependent on the method of exposure assessment or outcome ascertainment. In analyses of 
different combinations of cardiometabolic conditions, odds ratios associated with classes II and III obesity were 2·2 
(95% CI 1·9–2·6) for vascular disease only (coronary heart disease or stroke), 12·0 (8·1–17·9) for vascular disease 
followed by diabetes, 18·6 (16·6–20·9) for diabetes only, and 29·8 (21·7–40·8) for diabetes followed by vascular disease.
Interpretation The risk of cardiometabolic multimorbidity increases as BMI increases; from double in overweight 
people to more than ten times in severely obese people compared with individuals with a healthy BMI. Our findings 
highlight the need for clinicians to actively screen for diabetes in overweight and obese patients with vascular disease, 
and pay increased attention to prevention of vascular disease in obese individuals with diabetes.

stroke, was associated with a risk of death substantially 
greater than that for each of these diseases on their 
own.3 For example, at age 60 years, people with one 
cardiometabolic 
disease 
had 
a 
life 
expectancy 
6 to 10 years shorter than those with no such disease, 
whereas people with cardiometabolic multimorbidity 
had a life expectancy shorter by up to 15 years.3 Little is 
known about the risk factors for cardiometabolic 
multimorbidity because clinical trials often exclude 
patients with multimorbidity, and observational studies 
typically focus on single disease outcomes.
Global rates of obesity (defined as a BMI of ≥30 kg/m²) 
range between 11% and 15%.4 Results of the Non-
Communicable Disease Collaboration analyses of almost 
20 million adults showed that the global prevalence of 
obesity doubled between 1975 and 2014. Despite an 
overarching aim of the WHO’s 25 × 25 global prevention 
programme being to halt the rise in obesity, the 
population mean for BMI has continued to increase, 
with little sign of levelling off.4–6 High BMI is linked to a 
range of chronic disoders, disability, and reduced 
longevity.7–9 In particular, a large body of research shows 
that 
obesity 
increases 
the 
risk 
of 
individual 
cardiometabolic diseases.10 However, the extent to which 
obesity also contributes to cardiometabolic multi-
morbidity is currently unknown.
To address some of these limitations, we pooled 
individual-level data from prospective cohort studies 
to establish the risk of incident cardiometabolic 
multimorbidity in adults who are overweight and 
obese, compared with those who are a healthy weight. 
Importantly, the size of the dataset allowed us, for the 
first time, to differentiate between mild obesity (class I) 
and severe obesity (class II and III).
Methods
Study population
In this pooled analysis of individual-level data, we identified 
participants from prospective cohort studies from open-
access data archives, Inter-University Consortium for 
Political and Social Research, and the UK Data Service, and 
from the Individual-Participant Meta-analysis in Working 
Populations (IPD-Work) consortium (figure 1).11 We 
included all cohort studies with individual-level data 
available for BMI at baseline and cardiometabolic 
multimorbidity at follow-up (ten studies from the 
open-access data archives and six from the IPD-Work 
consortium). Table 1 lists the studies included.12–26 The 
appendix provides a description of the studies (p 1).
Participants included in the analyses were 35 years or 
older, had data available for BMI at baseline and for 
type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, and stroke at 
baseline and follow-up. We excluded participants with a 
diagnosis of diabetes, coronary heart disease, or stroke at 
or before study baseline. All studies providing individual 
participant data for the meta-analysis had obtained 
ethical approval.
Baseline assessment
BMI was calculated using the formula: weight in kg 
divided by height in metres squared. Weight and height at 
baseline were measured in the English Longitudinal 
Study of Ageing (ELSA);14 the British Health and Lifestyle 
Survey (HALS);15 the Whitehall II Study (Whitehall II);24 
the Work, Lipids and Fibrinogen Study, Norland 
(WOLF-N);25 the Work, Lipids and Fibrinogen Study, 
Stockholm (WOLF-S);26 and were self-reported in the 
Americans’ Changing Lives Study (ACL);12 the Alameda 
County Study (ACS);13 the Finnish Public Sector Study 
Research in context
Systematic review
We searched PubMed up to November, 2016, with no date 
limits or language restrictions using the terms “body mass 
index”, “obesity”, “overweight” and “cardiometabolic 
multimorbidity”. We identified large-scale studies examining 
the consequences of cardiometabolic multimorbidity and 
treatment of obesity in patients with comorbid disorders. 
However, none of these studies focused on obesity or BMI as a 
risk factor for cardiometabolic multimorbidity.
Added value of the research
We collected a large set of individual-level data from 
16 prospective cohort studies to assess the association 
between BMI and the risk of developing cardiometabolic 
multimorbidity (ie, at least two from: type 2 diabetes, 
coronary heart disease, and stroke). Data from our 10 year 
follow-up of more than 120 000 adults without 
cardiometabolic disease at baseline suggest that, compared 
with healthy weight people, being overweight is associated 
with double the risk of developing cardiometabolic 
multimorbidity; this risk increases to more than four in obese 
individuals, and more than ten in severely obese individuals. 
This association was noted in men and women, white and 
non-white, younger and older individuals, and was not 
attributable to lifestyle risk factors, such as physical activity, 
smoking, or alcohol consumption.
Interpretation
Our study quantifies the risk of developing cardiometabolic 
multimorbidity in overweight, obese, and severely obese 
individuals. The findings highlight the need for clinicians to 
actively screen for diabetes in overweight and obese patients 
with vascular disease, and pay increased attention to prevention 
of vascular disease in obese individuals with diabetes. The strong 
link between BMI and cardiometabolic multimorbidity, a 
disorder that increases mortality risk substantially beyond that 
associated with single cardiometabolic diseases, should be 
acknowledged in health policies and clinical guidelines.

Support Cohort Study (HeSSup);23 the Health and 
Retirement Study (HRS);16 the National Survey of Midlife 
Development in the United States (MIDUS);17 the Survey 
of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe, including 
Austria, Belgium, Germany, Denmark, Spain, France, 
Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Israel (SHARE);18 the 
United Kingdom Household Panel Survey (UKHLS);19 the 
Wisconsin Longitudinal Study, graduate sample (WLSG);20 
and the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study, sibling sample 
(WLSS).20 We classified BMI into categories of  healthy 
(20·0–24·9 kg/m²), overweight (25·0–29·9 kg/m²), class I 
(mild) obesity (30·0–34·9 kg/m²) and class II and III 
(severe) obesity (≥35·0 kg/m²) according to WHO 
recommendations.27 As in previous studies, we used an 
inclusive definition of underweight (<20 kg/m²) to achieve 
sufficient case numbers for analysis.9
Demographic and lifestyle factors used as covariates, 
included age, sex, ethnic origin (white or non-white), 
leisure time physical activity (low, intermediate, or 
high),28 smoking (current, ex-smoker, or never),11 and 
alcohol consumption (none, moderate, or heavy),29 
ascertained 
at 
baseline 
using 
self-administered 
questionnaires. Ethnic origin was self-defined according 
to pre-set categories by participants in each study. These 
categories were designated as white or non-white by the 
relevant research team.
Follow-up of cardiometabolic diseases
In the ten studies with repeated resurveys (ACL, ACS, 
ELSA, HALS, HRS, MIDUS, SHARE, UKHLS, WLSG, 
and WLSS), non-fatal cardiometabolic diseases were 
ascertained via repeated self-reports of physician or health 
professional diagnosis of coronary heart disease, heart 
attack, angina, heart failure, heart trouble, or other heart 
problems; stroke; and diabetes or high blood glucose.
In the six studies linked to electronic medical records 
(FPS, GAZEL, HeSSup, Whitehall II, WOLF-N, and 
WOLF-S), information about fatal or non-fatal incident 
coronary heart disease during the follow-up period was 
ascertained from national hospitalisation and death 
registries. The one exception was the GAZEL study in 
which hospitalisation registry data were not available and 
non-fatal events were based on annual self-report 
questionnaires. Date of diagnosis, hospital admission 
due to myocardial infarction, or date of coronary death 
was used to define coronary heart disease incidence, 
coded using MONICA definitions or International 
Classification of Disease (ICD) codes.30,31 For mortality 
and hospital records, only the main diagnosis was used. 
We included all non-fatal myocardial infarctions that 
were recorded as International Classification of Diseases, 
version 10 (ICD-10) I21-I22 and coronary deaths recorded 
as ICD-10 I20-I25.
In the six record-linkage studies, we defined fatal or 
non-fatal incident stroke using national hospital 
admission and death registers (ICD-10 codes I60, I61, I63, 
I64). In Whitehall II, additional information came from 
self-reports in follow-up questionnaires and stroke event 
tracing.32 In GAZEL, only self-reports from annual follow-
up surveys and mortality records were available. Cases of 
fatal or non-fatal type 2 diabetes, diagnosed using ICD-10 
code E11, were identified from hospital admission and 
discharge registers, and from mortality records with 
mention of type 2 diabetes in any of the diagnostic codes.33 
Additionally, in FPS and HeSSup, participants were 
defined as diabetes cases the first time they appeared in 
the nationwide drug reimbursement register having been 
prescribed medication for the treatment of diabetes. In 
Whitehall II, type 2 diabetes was ascertained by 2 h oral 
glucose tolerance test administered every 5 years using 
WHO criteria (fasting glucose ≥7 mmol/L or 2 h post-load 
glucose ≥11·1 mmol/L),34 and complemented by self-
reports of diabetes diagnosis and medication.35 In the 
GAZEL study, diabetes cases were based on self-report 
from annual questionnaires or mortality records.
For coronary heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes, 
the onset date for incident disease was defined as the 
date of the first record during the follow-up period 
ascertained via any of the sources described above. For 
cardiometabolic multimorbidity the date of onset was 
defined as the date the second incident cardiometabolic 
disease was ascertained. In ACL, HALS, MIDUS, and 
UKHLS, dates of disease onset were not available and 
cardiometabolic multimorbidity was therefore recorded 
if the participant reported at least two of the 
three cardiometabolic conditions.
Outcomes
The main outcome was cardiometabolic multimorbidity 
(ie, developing at least two out of type 2 diabetes, coronary 
heart disease, and stroke). Additionally, we decomposed 
cardiometabolic 
multimorbidity 
into 
two 
distinct 
endpoints on the basis of the temporal order of disease 
occurrence: diabetes followed by vascular disease (ie, 
coronary heart disease or stroke) and vascular disease 
followed by diabetes.

Statistical analysis
We analysed BMI as a categorical variable (<20·0, 
20·0–24·9, 25·0–29·9, 30·0–34·9, ≥35 kg/m²) and as 
a continuous variable. In the main analysis, the 
associations 
between 
BMI 
and 
cardiometabolic 
multimorbidity were examined in two steps. First, we 
studied the association separately in each cohort study 
using logistic regression. We adjusted odds ratios and 
their 95% confidence intervals for age, sex, ethnic origin, 
and lifestyle factors (smoking, physical activity, and 
alcohol consumption). Cases were individuals who 
developed at least two of the three cardiometabolic 
disorders. To form a comparable group of disease-free 
non-cases as in analyses of individual cardiometabolic 
diseases and a uniform group in terms of cardiometabolic 
disease, we considered participants with none of the 
three disorders as non-cases and excluded those with one 
only from these analyses. Second, we pooled the study-
specific odds ratios using random-effects meta-analysis.
To assess whether the association between BMI and 
cardiometabolic multimorbidity was robust, we did 
several sensitivity and subgroup analyses; stratifying 
by method of exposure assessment (measured vs 
self-reported 
weight 
and 
height) 
and 
outcome 
ascertainment (electronic health records vs self-report), 
sex (men vs women), age group (<50 vs ≥50 years), and 
ethnic origin (white vs non-white). To achieve sufficient 
case numbers in these analyses, we pooled data from 
all cohort studies and did the logistic analysis in 
one step. The statistical significance of subgroup 
differences was evaluated by BMI category using 
meta-regression.
For the six cohort studies linked to electronic medical 
records, we additionally fitted Cox proportional hazards 
models and computed hazard ratios for the associations 
between BMI and cardiometabolic multimorbidity to 
examine whether hazard ratios and odds ratios were 
comparable.
To assess the association of BMI with different 
combinations of cardiometabolic disease, we formed a 
multicategory outcome variable with four disease 
endpoints: vascular disease only including incident 
coronary heart disease, incident stroke or both of these 
conditions; vascular disease followed by diabetes; 
diabetes only; and diabetes followed by vascular disease. 
The associations between BMI and this multicategory 
outcome variable were examined using multinomial 
regression, an extension of logistic regression that allows 
for a dependent variable with more than two categories. 
This set of analyses included participants with one 
disorder only.
We used Stata (version 13.1) for data analyses.

Results
Overall, we included 120 813 adults from Europe or the 
USA in the analyses. We excluded 9841 participants 
with a diagnosis of either diabetes, coronary heart 
disease, or stroke at or before study baseline. Table 1 
shows baseline characteristics of the study participants: 
71 445 (59%) of 120 813 participants were women, the 
mean age was 51·4 years (range 35–103), and the mean 
BMI was 25·9 kg/m² (SD 4·1). Across the BMI 
categories, 5039 (4%) participants were underweight, 
51 488 (43%) were a healthy weight, 46 132 (38%) were 
overweight, 13 943 (12%) were mildly obese, and 
4211 (4%) were severely obese.
During a mean follow-up of 10·7 years, 1627 participants 
developed cardiometabolic multimorbidity (incidence 
12·6 per 10 000 person-years). Figure 2 shows odds ratios 
for developing cardiometabolic multimorbidity adjusted 
for age, sex, and ethnic origin in overweight, mildly 
obese, and severely obese participants compared with 
healthy weight participants. After adjustment for 
sociodemographic and lifestyle factors, compared with 
individuals with a healthy weight, the risk of developing 
cardiometabolic multimorbidity in overweight indi-
viduals was twice as high (odds ratio [OR] 2·0, 95% CI 
1·7–2·4; p<0·0001), almost five times higher for 
individuals with class I obesity (4·5, 3·5–5·8; p<0·0001), 
and almost 15 times higher for individuals with classes II 
and III obesity combined (14·5, 10·1–21·0; p<0·0001).
For continuous BMI, the odds ratio for cardiometabolic 
multimorbidity was 1·9 (95% CI 1·8–2·3) per 5 kg/m² 
increase in BMI, and there was further evidence of a 
curvilinear association (linear term 2·3, 95% CI 2·0–2·5, 
quadratic term of 0·9, 0·9–1·0 when BMI was centered 
at 25 kg/m²; data not shown). The appendix provides 
study-specific findings (appendix p 2).
Figures 3 and 4 present the odds ratios for developing 
cardiometabolic multimorbidity in stratified analyses. 
The association between BMI and cardiometabolic 
multimorbidity was recorded irrespective of whether 
weight and height were measured or self-reported, and 
whether multimorbidity was ascertained using electronic 
health records or using repeated self-report surveys. 
Analyses stratified by sex suggested associations between 
BMI and cardiometabolic multimorbidity among men 
and women, as well as among younger and older, and 
among white and non-white participants. Although the 
odds ratio for BMI higher than 35 kg/m² seems higher in 
studies using electronic health records to ascertain 
multimorbidity (21·6, 95% CI 14·5–32·4) than in studies 
using repeated self-report surveys (8·8, 7·0–11·2), this 
difference is not significant when taking into account 
heterogeneity in study-specific effect estimates (figure 5). 
There was no evidence for any real differences in 
outcome associations related to other BMI categories or 
for subgroup analyses by sex, age, ethnic origin, and 
method of BMI assessment (appendix p 3). The findings 
were also independent of the method of statistical 
analysis; results from logistic regression models were 
similar to those from Cox proportional regression models 
(appendix p 4).

Table 2 shows multinomial regression with the 
different cardiometabolic conditions decomposed and 
analysed separately. Cohort studies with no data for the 
order of disease onset were excluded (ACL, HALS, 
MIDUS, UKHLS). Of the remaining 104  730 participants 
(mean follow-up 10·2 years), 6227 developed a vascular 
disease 
(50·4 
per 
10 000 
person-years) 
and 
6609 participants were diagnosed with diabetes (53·6 per 
10 000 person-years). Overweight and obesity were 
associated with increased odds ratios for all the 
cardiometabolic endpoints (table 2). For overweight, the 
odds ratios varied between 1·2 and 3·3 depending on the 
endpoint. The corresponding range of odds ratios was 
from 1·5 to 9·4 for mild obesity and from 2·2 to 29·8 for 
severe obesity. Odds ratios were highest for the outcomes 
of diabetes only and diabetes followed by vascular 
disease.
Discussion
Our analyses of more than 120 000 adults free of 
cardiometabolic diseases at study entry suggest that, 
compared with being a healthy weight, being overweight 
is associated with double the risk of developing 
cardiometabolic multimorbidity; in participants with 
mild and severe obesity, the risk is four and ten times 
bigger, respectively. Obesity is associated with unhealthy 
lifestyles such as physical inactivity, smoking, and 
alcohol consumption.36 However, after accounting for 
such behaviours, the associations of overweight and 
obesity with cardio 
metabolic multimorbidity remained 
strong.
Data from previous studies have suggested that obese 
men and women, compared with those of a healthy 
weight, have a 1·6 times increased risk of coronary heart 
disease37 and a 1·6–1·8 times increased risk of stroke and 
admittance to hospital for any cardiovascular disease.38,39 
In our study, the odds ratios for vascular disease without 
subsequent diabetes associated with mild obesity and 
with severe obesity, each compared with a healthy weight, 
were 1·5 and 2·2; for vascular disease followed by 
comorbid diabetes these were as high as 4·9 and 12·0. 
This finding reflects a substantially increased risk of 
diabetes among obese participants with vascular disease. 
In the Emerging Risk Factor Collaboration analysis of 
91 cohort studies, vascular disease without diabetes only 
doubled risk of death, but vascular disease with diabetes 
almost quadrupled it.3 Together, evidence from our study 
and the Emerging Risk Factor Collaboration indicates 
that high BMI is associated with serious forms of 
vascular disease. Data from Mendelian randomisation 
studies of BMI and cardiovascular disease suggest this 
association is probably causal.40–42
The link between high BMI and diabetes is especially 
strong, with randomised controlled trials, Mendelian 
randomisation analyses, and large-scale observational 
studies all supporting causality.43–46 A recent meta-
analysis of cohort studies found that obesity is

associated with more than a seven times increased 
risk of diabetes.46 Our data for diabetes-related 
multimorbidity add to this evidence by suggesting that 
high BMI is more strongly linked to diabetes followed 
by vascular disease (that is, diabetes with cardiovascular 
complications) than diabetes only. Odds ratios for the 
association between obesity and diabetes varied 
between 8·5 and 9·5, which is in agreement with 
previous findings.46 Severe obesity was linked to 
substantially greater disease risk, the odds ratios being 
almost 19-fold for diabetes alone and 30-fold for 
diabetes followed by vascular disease. The contribution 
of high BMI to diabetes development is marked and 
clearly exceeds its effect on vascular disease.47,48
Obesity increases the risk of dyslipidaemia and 
systemic inflammation, which could be common 
pathways to the development of both diabetes and 
vascular disease.48,49 However, there are additional 
pathways that might explain the stronger association of 
BMI with diabetes followed by vascular disease than 
vascular disease followed by diabetes. These include 
strong causal associations of overweight and obesity with 
metabolic abnormalities that are directly linked to 
diabetes and that develop early in the course of adiposity-
related pathophysiology, such as reduced peripheral 
glucose uptake, insulin resistance and glucotoxicity, 
finally leading to elevated blood glucose.48,50 By contrast, 
longer durations of obesity might be required for the 
development of atherosclerosis, which typically precedes 
overt vascular disease.51 This order of disease onset is 
supported by pooled analyses that show diabetes as an 
important mediator between obesity and coronary heart 
disease and stroke.52 
An alternative temporal sequence, from obesity to 
vascular disease and diabetes, is also biologically 
plausible because obesity could induce changes that are 
more strongly related to vascular events than diabetes, 
such as increased thrombogenic factors and raised blood 
pressure resulting from increased peripheral vascular 
resistance and renal salt retention.49,52 Additionally, people 
who develop vascular disease before diabetes might have 
early-onset susceptibility factors, which are independent 
of obesity, such as genetic predisposition to high blood 
pressure and dyslipidaemia, thus weakening the 
association between obesity and multimorbidity. It would 
be interesting to probe and quantify in subsequent 
studies the role of these and other factors, such as 
increased sympathetic nervous system activity, in the 
pathways from obesity to cardiometabolic multimorbidity.
The strength of this study lies in its novelty, the use of 
individual-participant data from prospective cohort 
studies from Europe and the USA, and the statistical 
power resulting from 16 studies which allowed us to 
determine associations between multiple BMI categories 
and cardiometabolic multimorbidity. This study also has 
limitations. Ascertainment of multimorbidity was based 
on repeat surveys in ten cohort studies. Electronic health 
records were available for six studies. Neither of our 
outcome ascertainment methods captured undiagnosed 
disease and in self-reported data fatal cardiometabolic 
disease was additionally missing. However, the pattern of 
results was similar in both sets of studies suggesting that 
self-reports did not substantially bias our findings. We 
did not have data for BMI during the follow-up or time-
dependent covariates, such as dietary factors or 
medication use.53 This prevented us from assessing 
potential biological and behavioural mediators for the 
observed associations.36 Reverse causation caused by 
weight loss after disease onset may lead the status of risk 
factor to be underestimated. This is an unlikely source of 
major bias in the present study because BMI was 
assessed in participants with no history of coronary heart 
disease, stroke, or diabetes. Not all of our cohorts were 
population based. However, the generalisability of our 
findings was strengthened by individual data from 
16 independent studies in 18 different countries with 
recruitment over three decades.

associated with mild obesity and severe obesity reaches 
levels that are seldom seen in modern epidemiology.54 
This study has practical implications. In view of the 
excess risk of death attributable to cardiometabolic 
multimorbidity, it is important that clinicians and their 
patients are informed that high BMI not only increases 
the risk of diabetes and vascular disease separately, but 
also of their more severe, comorbid forms. Our data 
support recommendations that clinicians treating 
overweight or obese patients with vascular disease screen 
for the development of diabetes. Screening for vascular 
disease in overweight or obese patients with diabetes is 
also clearly important. Given that overweight and obesity 
are increasing, acknowledging the high risk of 
cardiometabolic multimorbidity associated with these 
conditions in clinical guidelines and public health 
policies is vital.
