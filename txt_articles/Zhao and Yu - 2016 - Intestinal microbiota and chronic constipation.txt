REVIEW
Intestinal microbiota and chronic 
constipation
Ying Zhao1 and Yan‑Bo Yu2*
Abstract 
Chronic constipation is a prevalent, burdensome gastrointestinal disorder whose aetiology and pathophysiology 
remains poorly understood and is most likely multifactorial. Differences in the composition of the intestinal micro‑
biota have been demonstrated when constipated patients and healthy controls have been compared. Growing 
evidence indicates that alterations of intestinal microbiota may contribute to constipation and constipation‑related 
symptoms. The intestinal microbiota is a collection of microorganisms that live within the gastrointestinal tract, 
and perform many important health‑promoting functions. The intestinal microbiota aids in the breakdown of food 
products into absorbable nutrients, stimulates the host immune system, prevents growth of pathogenic bacteria and 
produces a great variety of biologically important compounds. In this review, we will summarize the current evidence 
supporting roles of the intestinal microbiota in the pathogenesis and management of chronic constipation. The 
discussion will shed light on the novel mechanisms of intestinal microbiota and gut function interactions, which is 
invaluable in ultimately developing new therapeutic tools for the treatment of chronic constipation.

Chronic constipation is a symptom-based gastrointestinal 
disorder characterized by difficult or infrequent passage of 
stool, hardness of stool, and/or a feeling of incomplete evac-
uation. It can result in some discomfort such as abdominal 
distension, abdominal pain, headache, dizziness and poor 
appetite. Constipation has an estimated prevalence reach-
ing up to 20 % in some populations, and this condition 
affects patients of all ages and gender and severely impacts 
on their quality of life (Bharucha 2007). The aetiology and 
pathophysiology of chronic constipation remains poorly 
understood and is most likely multifactorial. Furthermore, 
the clinical management of chronic constipation remains 
challenging. Growing evidence indicates that alterations of 
intestinal microbiota may contribute to constipation and 
constipation-related symptoms, which attracts considerable 
interest among gastrointestinal researchers in recent years.
The intestinal microbiota is a collection of microorgan-
isms that live within the gastrointestinal tract, with con-
centrations of up to 1011–1012 cells/g luminal contents. 
It is recognized that the number of bacteria within the 
gut is nearly 10 times that of the cells in the human body, 
including up to 1000 different bacterial species (Blaser 
et al. 2013). The microorganisms have a symbiotic rela-
tionship with their host, and perform many important 
health-promoting functions. The intestinal microbiota 
aids in the breakdown of food products into absorbable 
nutrients, stimulates the host immune system, prevents 
growth of pathogenic bacteria and produces a great 
variety of biologically important compounds, such as 
short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and neuro-modulatory 
substances. Multiples studies have revealed disturbances 
in the composition and stability of the gut microbiota in 
constipated patients compared with healthy controls. In 
this review, we will summarize the current evidence sup-
porting roles of the intestinal microbiota in the patho-
genesis and management of chronic constipation.

microbiota in patients with chronic constipation can be 
characterized by a relative decrease in obligate bacte-
ria (e.g. Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and Bacteroides 
spp.) and a parallel increase of potentially pathogenic 
microorganisms (e.g. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 
Campylobacter jejuni) (Gerritsen et al. 2011; Kirgizov 
et al. 2001). These alterations may influence intestinal 
motility and secretory functions by changing the amount 
of available physiologically active substances and the 
metabolic environment of the gut. Khalif et al. reported 
that the levels of Bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus were 
significantly decreased in adult patients with constipa-
tion (Khalif et al. 2005). Patients with constipation pre-
dominant-irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-C) exhibited a 
significant increase of Bacteroides sp. and Enterobacte-
riaceae (Simren et al. 2013). Further, the concentrations 
of Bifidobacteria, Clostridium leptum and Faecalibacte-
rium prausnitzii were decreased in these patients with 
IBS-C (Nourrisson et al. 2014). Meanwhile, one pediatric 
study indicated that Clostridia and Bifidobacteria were 
significantly increased in feces of constipated children. 
Besides, the clostridium species isolated from constipated 
children were different from those from healthy controls 
(Zoppi et al. 1998). Using 16S rRNA gene pyrosequenc-
ing method, Zhu et al. observed significantly decreased 
abundance in Prevotella and increased representation in 
several genera of Firmicutes in constipated patients com-
pared with controls (Zhu et al. 2014). Butyrate-producing 
genera, such as Coprococcus, Roseburia and Faecalibac-
terium, tended to be increased in constipated patients 
(Pryde et al. 2002; Sokol et al. 2008). These studies indi-
cated that constipation could be a consequence of the 
intestinal dysbiosis.
It should be noteworthy that discordances have been 
reported in the detection of microbiota alterations 
among patients with constipation. This discrepancy may 
be the result of different methods used for bacterial quan-
tifications, the use of single samples and other factors 
(e.g. diet and phenotypic characterization of patients) 
(Simren et al. 2013). Furthermore, most studies assessed 
the fecal microbiota, which are readily accessible, but do 
not fully replicate profiles of the mucosal microbiota of 
the patients with constipation. The mucosal microbiota 
might affect epithelial and mucosal function to a greater 
degree than the fecal microbiota (Durban et al. 2012; 
Parkes et al. 2012). One recent study reported that the 
overall composition of the colonic mucosal microbiota 
was associated with constipation and genera from Bac-
teroidetes were more abundant in the colonic mucosal 
microbiota of patients with constipation. Meanwhile, 
the profile of the fecal microbiota was associated with 
colonic transit and methane production, but not consti-
pation (Parthasarathy et al. 2016). More studies detailing 
higher resolution of the mucosal and fecal microbiota 
composition might expand our understanding of the rela-
tionships between intestinal microbiota and constipation.
Though widely used, the above cultural and/or molecu-
lar approaches could not assess the functional imbalance 
of intestinal microbiota in patients with constipation. 
Thereby, the function-based approach, based on the 
detection of specific metabolic activity expressed by a 
group of bacterial species, has been put forward in recent 
studies. Chassard et al. showed that the IBS-C micro-
biota was characterized by a high number of lactate- 
and H2-utilising sulphate-reducing bacteria compared 
with healthy controls, which could in turn influence 
colonic motility and visceral sensitivity and generate 
IBS symptoms (Chassard et al. 2012). Due to changes in 
metabolism output, the functional dysbiosis might have 
important clinical implications and provide a new dimen-
sion in management of chronic constipation.
Possible role of the intestinal microbiota in gut 
motility
Most of our knowledge on the effect of intestinal micro-
biota on gut motility derives from studies in germ-free 
animals. Germ-free rats exhibited longer migrating 
myoelectric complex (MMC) intervals compared with 
conventional rats (Caenepeel et al. 1989). Further, the 
cecum of germ-free rats was enlarged and gastric emp-
tying and colonic transit were delayed (Abrams 1977). 
Studies colonizing of conventional intestinal microbiota 
to germ-free rats revealed that Lactobacillus acidophi-
lus and Bifidobacterium bifidum could reduce the MMC 
period and accelerate small intestinal transit, while Mic-
rococcus luteus and Escherichia coli showed an inhibitory 
effect (Husebye et al. 2001). Barbara et al. put forward 
three mechanisms responsible for the effects of micro-
biota on intestinal motility (Barbara et al. 2005): (1) the 
release of bacterial substances or end-products of bacte-
rial fermentation; (2) intestinal neuroendocrine factors; 
(3) mediators released by the gut immune response.
The bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide may influ-
ence intestinal motility by delaying gastric emptying 
and inducing sphincteric dysfunction (Fan et al. 2001). 
Deconjugated bile salts, a kind of bacterial metabolite, 
may promote colonic motor responses and induce bile 
salt related diarrhea (Floch 2002). Short-chain fatty acids 
(SCFAs), such as butyrate, acetate, and propionate are 
produced in the colon by anaerobic bacterial metabolism 
of carbohydrates. SCFAs have been shown to stimulate 
ileal propulsive contractions by evoking prolonged prop-
agated contractions and discrete clustered contractions. 
The possible mechanisms of SCFAs in gut motility may 
involve the intestinal release of 5-hydroxytryptamine 
(5-HT). In addition, SCFAs could directly stimulate the

ileal and colonic smooth muscle contractility. Lactate 
can be quickly metabolized by specific bacterial spe-
cies into butyrate or propionate. High concentration of 
butyrate may inhibit mucin secretion by intestinal gob-
let cells (Baxter et al. 2014). Further study indicates that 
butyrate may reduce stool volume by stimulating water 
and electrolyte absorption in the colon (Canani et al. 
2011). The number of these lactate-utilising bacteria is 
obviously decreased tenfold in the faecal microbiota of 
IBS-C patients (Rajilic-Stojanovic et al. 2011). Human 
colonic gases produced by microflora may also be asso-
ciated with changes in gut motility. For example, breath 
methane excretion in patients with slow-transit consti-
pation was greater than in healthy subjects or patients 
with normal-transit constipation, supporting the idea 
that methane can slow gut transit (Attaluri et al. 2010). 
However, recent study reported that methane production 
was associated with the composition of the fecal micro-
biota, but not with constipation or colonic transit (Par-
thasarathy et al. 2016). Meanwhile, H2 accumulation has 
been postulated to account for the symptom of bloating 
and pain (Pimentel et al. 2000). Colonic H2S has been 
demonstrated to modulate peripheral pain-related sig-
nals, which may ultimately influence gut sensory-motor 
functions (Kawabata et al. 2007). Cell-envelope-associ-
ated multi-protein system, termed as “starch utilization 
system (SUS)”
, is present in Bacteroides species such as 
Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (Lammerts van Bueren 
et al. 2015). Increased number of Bacteroides species may 
be associated with production of organic acids in excess 
via fermentation, which may contribute to the symptoms 
of abdominal distension. Small intestinal bacterial over-
growth (SIBO) is a condition involves abnormal growth 
of endogenous bacteria in the small intestine resembling 
those normally found in the colon. The clinical manifes-
tations of SIBO are wide ranging and include abdominal 
discomfort, bloating, diarrhea, weight loss and nutri-
tional deficiencies (Gabrielli et al. 2013). Due to the 
inherent difficulties in measuring small bowel motility, 
few studies have illustrated a direct relationship between 
impaired small intestinal motility and SIBO. Roland et al. 
(2015) recently reported that patients undergoing wire-
less motility capsule with SIBO have significant delays in 
small bowel transit time as compared with those without. 
Future prospective studies are needed to further charac-
terize SIBO and contributing pathophysiological mecha-
nisms in small bowel dysmotility.
It has been hypothesized that intestinal microbiota 
could modulate gut motility through the release of neu-
roendocrine factors. For instance, the presence of soma-
tostatin was firstly clarified in Bacillus subtilis (Lenard 
1992). Germfree rats had increased gastrin-, serotonin-, 
and motilin-immunoreactive cells in selective areas of the 
gastrointestinal mucosa. Neuropeptide Y, an inhibitory 
neuropeptide, was found decreased in blood concentra-
tion after introduction of conventional intestinal micro-
biota in these rats (Husebye et al. 2001). These findings 
indirectly demonstrated that the intestinal microbiota 
could regulate endocrine cells and ultimately influence 
the gut motility. Besides, the effect of microbiota-derived 
SCFAs on colonic serotonin and motilin-containing 
enteroendocrine cells has also been proposed in the reg-
ulation of colonic physiology.
In immunocompetent hosts, the commensal colonic 
microbiota are major determinants of mucosal and sys-
temic immunity. For example, Bacteroides fragilis can 
mediate the development of Foxp3+ Treg cells through 
the activation of Toll-like receptor (TLR)2 (Nutsch and 
Hsieh 2012). Clostridium species induce Foxp3+ Treg 
cells through the induction of transforming growth 
factor-β (TGF-β) (Ivanov and Littman 2010). Mediators 
released by colonic immune cells are known to modu-
late various digestive functions. Increased expression of 
IL-1β, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) have 
been demonstrated in colitis rat model. IL-1β could cause 
a pronounced suppression of the synthesis and release 
of both acetylcholine and noradrenaline (Collins 1996). 
Synergistic interactions between IL-1 and IL-6 have been 
confirmed both pharmacologically and electrophysi-
ologically (Atanasova et al. 2011). Similar observations 
were drawn with respect to the role of TNF-α to suppress 
noradrenaline release (O’Sullivan et al. 2009). Clostridial 
species and polysaccharide A derived from Bacteroidetes 
species strains induce IL-10 production and promote 
T-regulatory cell development (Suszko and Obminska-
Mrukowicz 2013). Segmented filamentous bacteria, 
Candidatus svagella, are required for differentiation of 
T helper 17 (TH17) cells and induce luminal secretion 
of IgA (Ivanov and Littman 2010). Disruptions in colonic 
immunity can result in abnormal responses to luminal 
contents and this mechanism is suspected to be a com-
ponent in the development of colonic motility disorder.
Possible microbiota‑based therapy on chronic 
constipation
Dietary fibre
Dietary fibre has been recommended on an empirical 
basis for the management of chronic constipation. As 
is known, dietary fibres can promote the excretion of 
intestinal mucin by stimulating the capacity of mucosal 
protein synthesis (Derrien et al. 2010). Dietary fibre is 
broken down in the proximal colon and provides an 
energy yielding substrate for microbial fermentation. 
The result of this is to stimulate the growth of intestinal 
microbiota and contribute significantly to the stool dry 
weight. Besides, fibres could promote the excretion of

bacterial fermentation products, such as SCFAs, which 
has the pro-motility effects (Jennings et al. 2009). Die-
tary fibre is also an important source of gas in the colon. 
Hydrogen, methane and carbon dioxide, which are prin-
cipal end products of bacterial fermentation, can increase 
stool bulk and promote colonic transit (Lopez Roman 
et al. 2008). There is evidence indicates that dietary fibres 
(wheat bran, pea fibres) can modulate intestinal microbi-
ota, including the stimulation of beneficial bacterial spe-
cies and the suppression of pathogenic bacterial species 
(Chen et al. 2013).
Prebiotics
Prebiotics are non-digestible substances that provide a 
beneficial physiological effect on the host by selectively 
stimulating the growth or activity of a limited number of 
favourable indigenous gut bacteria. Prebiotics stimulate 
the preferential growth of a limited number of health-
promoting commensal flora already residing in the 
colon, such as Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria. Examples 
of prebiotics include fructo-oligosaccharides, galacto-
oligosaccharides and inulin. Fibre and fibre supplements 
employed in the treatment of constipation also exert 
prebiotic effects (Bouhnik et al. 2004). Prebiotics are 
subjected to bacterial metabolism in the colon, where 
they are transformed to lactic and short-chain carbox-
ylic acids. It has been demonstrated that galacto-oligo-
saccharides seemed to promote the intestinal peristalsis 
and relieve constipation (Li et al. 2013). The consump-
tion of inulin-type fructans affects intestinal microbiota 
and stimulates bowel movements normalizing stool fre-
quency in constipated patients (Quigley 2011). It should 
be noteworthy that most of the evidence regarding the 
beneficial effect of prebiotics in constipation is derived 
from animal studies. Human trials are only conducted on 
small number of constipated subjects (Table 1). However, 
one recent trial of prebiotics in sixty constipated women 
reported that there was no significant difference in satis-
faction in relief of constipation between prebiotic group 
and placebo group (Linetzky Waitzberg et al. 2012). Fur-
ther adequately powered studies need to be carried out to 
draw more definitive conclusions.
Probiotics
Probiotics are live or attenuated microorganisms 
defined as being capable of conferring health benefits 
on their host when they are given in sufficient quanti-
ties and administered continuously, beyond any inher-
ent nutritional value. Probiotics have demonstrated 
beneficial effects in patients with constipation, making 
them increasingly used as alterative treatment options 
(Table 2). A recent systematic review of probiotics for 
the treatment of chronic constipation demonstrated that 
probiotics did lead to a significant improvement in the 
mean number of stools per week (Dimidi et al. 2014). 
Several mechanisms have been proposed by which probi-
otics may benefit chronic constipation: (1) probiotics may 
modify the altered intestinal microbiota in patients with 
constipation; (2) probiotic metabolites may alter gut sen-
sation and motility function (Waller et al. 2011); (3) some 
probiotics may regulate the intraluminal environment, 
such as increasing the end products of bacterial fermen-
tation, reducing luminal pH (Waller et al. 2011), etc.
Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli are the generally recog-
nized beneficial species with various health-promoting 
functions such as the production of SCFAs, stimulation 
of intestinal peristalsis and increasing the humidity of 
the fecal bolus (Ojetti et al. 2014). A large randomized 
controlled trial demonstrated that the intake of an 
effective amount of Lactobacillus plantarum and Bifi-
dobacterium breve, or Bifidobacterium lactis is able to 
significantly relieve the evacuation disorders and hard 
stools in patients with constipation (Del Piano et al. 
2010). The supplementation with Lactobacillus casei

Shirota could significantly increase the frequency of def-
ecations and the softness of the stool in IBS-C patients 
(Koebnick et al. 2003). A positive effect of Lactobacillus 
reuteri on bowel movement frequency has been con-
firmed in both adult and children patients with constipa-
tion (Wu et al. 2013). Evidence showed L. reuteri could 
promote both the frequency and velocity of colonic 
myoelectric motility complex (Barbara et al. 2005). 
One in vitro study indicated that Escherichia coli Nissle 
1917 supernatants could enhance colonic contractility 
by direct stimulation of smooth muscle cells (Bar et al. 
2009).
Some probiotics, such as Bifidobacterium lactis 
DN-173010 and Bifidobacterium longum could modify 
the metabolic activities of the colonic microbiota and 
improve lactose digestion in Chinese lactose-intolerant 
subjects (He et al. 2008). In children, Lactobacillus casei 
rhamnosus Lcr35 showed a favorable effect on relieving 
the symptoms of constipation (Bu et al. 2007). The com-
bination of probiotics and prebiotics, which is named 
synbiotics, may provide synergistic effects. Synbiotic 
administration may improve the survival of probiotics 
and restore intestinal microbial balance, which may have 
positive effects on the treatment of constipation (Khoda-
dad and Sabbaghian 2010). A meta-analysis conducted by 
Alexander C. Ford reported that synbiotics appeared to 
be more effective than placebo in chronic constipation. 
And the number needed to treat (NNT) with synbiotics 
in chronic constipation was 5 (95 % CI 3–14) (Ford et al. 
2014).
Probiotics have been widely used nowadays for the 
treatment of constipation, however, concerns about the 
safety of probiotics still warrant further discussion. Pro-
biotic administration may modulate the composition of 
the intestinal microbiota and consequently induce the 
alteration of metabolic activities and colonic immuno-
logical activities (Dai et al. 2014). Besides, the probiotic 
administration may transfer the antimicrobial resistance 
genes to the normal intestinal flora and pathogenic spe-
cies (Drago et al. 2013).
Fecal microbiota transplantation
Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), also known as 
“fecal bacteriotherapy” or “fecal infusion”
, refers to the pro-
cess of transplanting the functional flora from the stools of 
healthy donor to the gastrointestinal tract of recipient indi-
vidual. It has been proposed as a therapeutic approach for 
chronic constipation by reestablishment of the wide diver-
sity of intestinal flora. For example, one patient reported 
by Andrews et al. developed constipation and received 
FMT therapy. Two to three days following therapy, the 
patient’s stool frequency increased to 1–2 per day without 
laxative-use (Borody et al. 2004). Borody et al. adminis-
tered FMT to 4 patients with chronic constipation. All 4 
patients experienced immediate resolution of symptoms 
of constipation to 1–2 stools per day with an accompany-
ing resolution of most associated symptoms such as epi-
sodic nausea, vomiting, bloating and abdominal pain. And 
this improvement persisted for 6–28 months of follow-up 
(Borody et al. 1989). Li et al. treated 24 patients with slow

transit constipation (STC) by means of FMT. The patients’ 
stool frequency increased from a mean of 1.8 (SD 1.3) per 
week to 4.1 (SD 2.6) at week 12 post-FMT. Compared with 
baseline, significant overall improvements were seen in 
gastrointestinal quality-of-life index score during 12 weeks 
of follow-up (Tian et al. 2016). Though published reports 
on FMT are few in number and consist of just small 
uncontrolled open studies and case reports, the thera-
peutic benefits of FMT for the treatment of constipation 
suggests potential for this inexpensive and safe treatment 
modality to undergo further investigations for clinical use.
Conclusions
Collectively, the altered intestinal microbiota may play an 
essential role in the pathogenesis of chronic constipation. 
However, the precise mechanism of intestinal microbiota 
on the regulation of gut sensory and motor functions is 
still partly unclear. Future research identifying precisely 
how the intestinal microbiota participate in the modula-
tion of gut physiology and pathophysiology will be ben-
eficial for our understanding of the interactions between 
the intestinal microbiota and gut function, which is also 
invaluable in ultimately developing new therapeutic tools 
for the management of chronic constipation.
