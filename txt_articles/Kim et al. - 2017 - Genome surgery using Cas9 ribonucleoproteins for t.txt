RNA-guided genome surgery using CRISPR-Cas9 nucleases has shown promise for the treatment of diverse genetic diseases.
Yet, the potential of such nucleases for therapeutic applications in nongenetic diseases is largely unexplored. Here, we focus
on age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a leading cause of blindness in adults, which is associated with retinal overex-
pression of, rather than mutations in, the VEGFA gene. Subretinal injection of preassembled, Vegfa gene–specific Cas9
ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) into the adult mouse eye gave rise to mutagenesis at the target site in the retinal pigment epi-
thelium. Furthermore, Cas9 RNPs effectively reduced the area of laser-induced choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in a
mouse model of AMD. Genome-wide profiling of Cas9 off-target effects via Digenome-seq showed that off-target mutations
were rarely induced in the human genome. Because Cas9 RNPs can function immediately after in vivo delivery and are rap-
idly degraded by endogenous proteases, their activities are unlikely to be hampered by antibody- and cell-mediated adap-
tive immune systems. Our results demonstrate that in vivo genome editing with Cas9 RNPs has the potential for the local
treatment for nongenetic degenerative diseases, expanding the scope of RNA-guided genome surgery to a new dimension.

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of
blindness in aged populations in developed countries (Jager et al.
2008). Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is a major pathologic
feature of neovascular AMD and is caused primarily by angiogenic
cytokines such as vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA). In
fact, VEGFA is a major therapeutic target for the treatment of AMD
using monoclonal antibodies or aptamers since it emerged as an
important factor in angiogenesis (Leung et al. 1989). Currently,
intravitreous anti-VEGF therapy is a mainstay of treatment for neo-
vascular AMD (CATT Research Group et al. 2011; Schmidt-Erfurth
et al. 2014). However, these anti-VEGF agents must be injected at
least seven times per year, because VEGF is continuously overex-
pressed in and secreted from diseased retinal pigment epithelium
(RPE) cells. In this clinical circumstance, we reasoned that targeted
inactivation of the VEGFA gene in RPE cells could reduce the VEGF
level below a pathological threshold, leading to a long-term or per-
manent treatment of AMD, possibly in combination with current
anti-VEGF therapy.
The type II CRISPR-Cas9 systems, repurposed from prokaryot-
ic adaptive immune responses, are now widely used for targeted ge-
nome modifications in plants, animals, and human cells (Kim
et al. 2014; Woo et al. 2015; Zuris et al. 2015). In particular, Cas9
nucleases have shown promise for gene and cell therapy (Maeder
and Gersbach 2016). Typically, these nucleases are expressed or de-
livered in vivo using plasmid DNA or viruses (Yin et al. 2014; Ran
et al. 2015). However, plasmid DNA delivery is often inefficient, es-
pecially in vivo, and can cause integration of small plasmid frag-
ments degraded by endogenous nucleases at on-target and off-
target sites in the genome (Kim et al. 2014). Viral delivery of
Cas9 can be highly efficient in vivo (Ran et al. 2015; Long et al.
2016; Nelson et al. 2016; Tabebordbar et al. 2016), but may be
hampered by antibodies or T cells induced against the protein
(Shankar et al. 2007; Calcedo et al. 2015; Chew et al. 2016). We
and others have shown that preassembled Cas9 ribonucleopro-
teins (RNPs) can be delivered to human primary and stem cells
and mice to modify target genes (Kim et al. 2014; Schumann
et al. 2015; Zuris et al. 2015). Cas9 RNPs are rapidly turned over
in cells, reducing off-target effects. Furthermore, Cas9 RNPs are un-
likely to be limited by host immune systems because they function
and disappear before the generation of antibodies and T cells di-
rected against them. Currently, despite these advantages of
RNPs, the difficult delivery of Cas9 RNPs in vivo limits its utility
for therapeutic applications (Zuris et al. 2015). Here, we show
that in vivo genome editing of an wild-type gene, whose up-regu-
lation is responsible for pathogenesis, could be a new therapeutic
modality for the treatment of nongenetic degenerative diseases.
Our ultimate goal is to harness Cas9 RNPs for a clinical application
of therapeutic genome surgery in patients with AMD.

surgery for the treatment of AMD, we first identified Cas9 target

 sites that are conserved in both the human VEGFA gene and the
mouse Vegfa gene using Cas-Designer (Park et al. 2015a) and that
differ from any other site in the human genome by at least two
or three nucleotides using Cas-OFFinder (Bae et al. 2014). We test-
ed four single-chain guide RNAs (sgRNAs) targeting these sites in
exons 3 and 4 (labeled as Vegfa-1, 2, 3, and 4), which encode bind-
ing sites for VEGF receptors 1 and 2, respectively, in the mouse
NIH3T3 cell line (Supplemental Table S1; Supplemental Fig. S1)
and the human RPE cell line (ARPE-19). The most active Vegfa-1
sgRNA complexed with the recombinant Cas9 protein and deliv-
ered via transfection using cationic lipid induced small insertions
and deletions (indels) at the target site with a frequency of 82 ± 5%
or 57 ± 3% in NIH3T3 cells or ARPE-19 cells, respectively (Fig. 1A–
D). At day 2 post-treatment, Cas9 RNP delivery was much more ef-
ficient than plasmid transfection in these cells (Fig. 1C). We also
carried out additional experiments using confluent ARPE-19 cells.
Cells were harvested at 64 h after transfection and were analyzed
using deep sequencing, qPCR, and ELISA to measure indel
frequencies, mRNA levels, and protein levels, respectively. Indels
were detected at a frequency of 40 ± 8% in the Vegfa-RNP-treated
ARPE-19 cells (Fig. 1E). The Cas9 RNP reduced the VEGFA mRNA
level by 24 ± 4% and the VEGFA protein level by 52 ± 9% in conflu-
ent ARPE-19 cells under post-mitotic conditions (Fig. 1F,G).
To monitor the localization of Cas9 RNPs in vitro and in vivo,
we used Cy3-conjugated Cas9 protein (Deng et al. 2015). Thus,
Cy3-Cas9 combined with or without the Vegfa-1 sgRNA was mixed
with cationic lipids and delivered into NIH3T3 cells. The Cy3-Cas9
RNP was detected in many nuclei (Fig. 2A,B) and induced indels at
the target site (Fig. 2C,D). Interestingly, the proportion of Cy3 pos-
itive nuclei (42 ± 6%) (Fig. 2B) was almost equal to the frequency of
indels (40 ± 3%) (Fig. 2D) at the target site, suggesting that target
sites were almost completely cleaved in cells by nucleus-localized
Cas9, and the rate-limiting factor in genome editing was nuclear
localization of Cas9. Cy3-Cas9 alone was rarely detected in nuclei
and did not induce indels (Fig. 2A,D). Note that Cas9 is a positively
charged protein with a pI value of 9.12 and cannot form a complex
with cationic lipids in the absence of negatively charged sgRNAs.
The Cy3-Cas9 RNP, however, was less active than the unlabeled
Cas9 RNP, which induced target-specific mutations at a frequency
of 80%.
Next, we delivered the Vegfa-specific, Cy3-labeled or -unla-
beled Cas9 RNP into the adult mouse eye via subretinal injection

 (Park et al. 2015c). Cy3 dye was observed in the nuclei of the RPE
in vivo 3 d after the injection (Fig. 2E). Notably, the subretinal in-
jection of the Cy3-unlabeled Cas9 RNP gave rise to indels with a
frequency of 25 ± 3% in RPE cells in the RNP-injected area at
day 3 post-injection (n = 5) (Fig. 2F; Supplemental Fig. S2A).
Subretinal injection of RNPs did not induce detectable on-target
indels in the neural retinal tissue or in the remnant RPE-cho-
roid-sclera complex after RPE removal. Thus, in our experiments,
subretinal injection of RNPs can induce indels in RPE cells in the
injected area. We also performed Western blot analysis and found
that the Cas9 protein was degraded completely at day 3 post-injec-
tion (Fig. 2G), showing that Cas9 was rapidly turned over in
vivo. Considering that Cas9 expression in vivo using adeno-asso-
ciated virus (AAV) can evoke host immune responses with distinct
cellular and molecular signatures (Chew et al. 2016), rapid degra-
dation of Cas9 after RNP delivery has an advantage for in vivo
application.
Encouraged by the efficient delivery and high mutation fre-
quency of the Vegfa-specific Cas9 RNP in vitro and in vivo, we in-
vestigated whether the Cas9 RNP could be used for the treatment
of CNV in a mouse model of AMD (Lambert et al. 2013). Mice with
laser-induced CNV were treated by subretinal injection of the
Vegfa-specific Cas9 RNP or Rosa26-specific Cas9 RNP (Fig. 3A).
The Rosa26-RNP was used as a negative control. At day 3 post-injec-
tion, indels were analyzed in RPE cells in the Cas9 RNP-injected
CNV area. Cas9-induced indels were detected at a frequency of
22 ± 5% or 24 ± 2% in the Vegfa-RNP-treated or the Rosa26-RNP-
treated CNV (n = 5), respectively (Fig. 3E,F; Supplemental Fig.
S2B), demonstrating that subretinal injection of the Vegfa-RNP
can lead to local treatment in the eye. In addition, the Vegfa-RNP
effectively reduced the concentration of the VEGFA protein in
the CNV area (300 ± 20 pg/mL, n = 10), compared to the Rosa26-
RNP (440 ± 30 pg/mL, n = 10, P < 0.001,
One-way ANOVA and
Tukey post-hoc tests) (Fig. 3D). At day 7 post-injection, a thera-
peutic effect was evaluated by assessing the CNV area. In mice
treated with the Vegfa-RNP, the CNV area was significantly re-
duced (58 ± 4%, n = 15, P < 0.001, Student’s t-test), compared to
that in Rosa26-RNP injected mice (Fig. 3B,C). Our results suggest
that targeted inactivation of Vegfa in the RPE using Cas9 RNPs en-
ables therapeutic genome surgery for the local treatment of AMD.

 A critical issue in therapeutic genome surgery is the target
specificity of CRISPR-Cas9 nucleases. We investigated whether
the Vegfa-RNP used in this study caused any off-target mutations
in the mouse eye or in human cells. First, using Cas-OFFinder
(Bae et al. 2014), we identified 20 potential off-target sites in the
mouse genome that are most highly homologous to the Cas9
target site (Supplemental Table S2). Genomic DNA was isolated
from the CNV-free, RPE complex in the mouse eye treated with
the Cas9 RNP and subjected to targeted deep sequencing. At these
20 sites, no Cas9-induced indels were detected with a frequency
greater than 0.1%, demonstrating that no off-target mutations
were induced above sequencing error rates (0.1%, on average)
(Supplemental Fig. S3).
Next, we determined genome-wide off-target effects in the
human genome rather than the mouse genome (Fig. 4A,B). Note
that the target sequence of this particular Cas9 RNP is conserved
in the human VEGFA gene. We assessed the human genome-
wide specificity using Digenome-seq (Kim et al. 2015, 2016b),
in which cell-free human genomic DNA is digested in vitro using
the Vegfa-specific Cas9 RNP and then subjected to whole-genome
sequencing. Uniform, rather than random, alignments of se-
quence reads at in vitro cleavage sites are computationally iden-
tified to provide a list of potential off-target sites. Digenome-
seq using the Vegfa-RNP revealed 42 in vitro cleavage sites includ-
ing the on-target site (Supplemental Table S3). To validate or in-
validate these sites, we carried out targeted deep sequencing
using genomic DNA isolated from Vegfa-RNP-transfected ARPE-
19 cells. Although these sites were cleaved efficiently in vitro,
off-target indels were not detected at these 41 cleavage sites above
sequencing error rates (Fig. 4C). Use of Cpf1 (Zetsche et al. 2015;
Kim et al. 2016a), Cas9 variants (Kleinstiver et al. 2016;
Slaymaker et al. 2016), or modified gRNAs (Cho et al. 2014;
Fu et al. 2014) with improved specificity may avoid this residual
off-target effect, if necessary. Taken together, these results
show that the Vegfa-RNP is highly specific in both mouse and hu-
man cells.

 Another major concern for mutating the Vegfa gene for the
treatment of AMD is its trophic role in the eye. Cone dysfunction
is the most significant change and is observed 3 d after conditional
deletion of the Vegfa gene in mouse RPE (Kurihara et al. 2012).
Note, however, that the Vegfa gene was mutated locally at the
site of the RNP injection in our study. We evaluated the integrity
of cone opsin at day 7, rather than day 3, post-injection and found
that no cone dysfunction had occurred (Supplemental Fig. S4).
Discussion
In this study, we showed that genome surgery using Cas9 RNPs has
the potential for local, rather than systemic, treatment for nonge-
netic diseases such as AMD. Unlike previous studies involving
RNA-guided genome editing in vivo to correct genetic defects,
this report is focused on inactivating a disease-causing wild-type
gene. This approach can broaden the scope of druggable targets
from several protein families such as kinases, ion channels, and
G protein-coupled receptors to any protein-coding or noncoding
genes.
We believe that eye diseases are well-suited for in vivo ge-
nome editing using Cas9 RNPs. Because of its compartmented
anatomy, subretinal injection is an optimized technique to deliver
Cas9 RNPs into RPE cells for the local treatment. The laser-induced
CNV model in mice that was used in this study is not suitable for
multiple injection of Cas9 RNPs, because CNV formation peaks ∼2
wk after laser treatment and then slightly regressed over time. For
multiple injection studies, large animal models such as nonhuman
primates should be considered. In human or nonhuman primates,
subretinal injection of RNPs in a volume of 100–150 µL would be
enough to cover choroidal neovascularization. We envision that
genome surgery is not just a metaphor but can be a graphic descrip-
tion of “operations” in the near future by which surgeons or phy-
sicians use Cas9 RNPs as microscalpels to cut and paste disease-
causing genetic elements in patients.
Methods
Data reporting
No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size for in
vitro and in vivo experiments. The investigators were not blinded
to allocation during in vivo experiments, but single-blinded to the
outcome assessment, specifically measurement of the CNV area.
Preparation of Cas9 RNPs
Purified Cas9 protein was purchased from ToolGen, Inc. sgRNAs
were generated by in vitro transcription using T7 polymerase
(New England BioLabs) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Briefly, templates for sgRNA were generated by annealing and ex-
tension of two complementary oligonucleotides (Supplemental
Table S4). Templates were incubated with T7 RNA polymerase in
reaction buffer (40 mM Tris-HCl, 20mM MgCl2, 2 mM spermidine,
1 mM DTT, pH7.9), including NTPs (Jena Bioscience) and RNase
inhibitor (New England BioLabs) for 16 h at 37°C. Transcribed
sgRNAs were incubated with DNase I (New England BioLabs) for
30 min at 37°C. sgRNAs were purified using RNeasy MinElute
Cleanup kit (Qiagen) and quantified using NanoDrop (Thermo
Fisher Scientific). Purified sgRNAs (65 µg) were incubated with
CIP (1000 units) (Alkaline Phosphatase, New England BioLabs)
for the removal of 3-phosphate for 1 h at 37°C. sgRNAs were

 purified again using the RNeasy MinElute Cleanup kit (Qiagen)
and quantified using NanoDrop (Thermo Fisher Scientific). We
also tested cell viability and indel efficiency using all Cas9 protein
and sgRNA stocks, and high efficiency Cas9 protein and sgRNA
stocks were used for in vivo eye injections.
Cy3-labeled Cas9 protein purification
After transformation of the pET28-NLS-Cas9 vector into E. coli
strain BL21 (DE3), Cas9 protein expression was induced for 12 h
at 18°C with 0.5 mM isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside
(IPTG). The bacterial cells were lysed by sonication; after centrifu-
gation at 20,000g for 30 min, the soluble lysate was mixed with Ni-
NTA beads (Qiagen), and Cy3 dye (GE Healthcare) was added at a
1:10 ratio (protein:dye molecules). The mixture was incubated
overnight (>12 h) at 4°C in the dark. Cy3-labeled Cas9 was eluted
with elution buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.6], 150–500 mM NaCl,
10%–25% glycerol, 0.2 M imidazole) and dialyzed against dialyz-
ing buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT, 10%
glycerol). The purified Cy3-labeled Cas9 protein was concentrated
using an Ultracel 100K cellulose column (Millipore). The purity of
the Cy3-labeled Cas9 protein was determined by SDS-PAGE. The
Cy3 labeling efficiency was measured by comparing the absorp-
tion spectra of the Cas9 protein (280 nm) and the conjugated
Cy3 dye molecule.
Cell culture and transfection
NIH3T3 (ATCC CRL-1658) and ARPE-19 (ATCC CRL-2302) cell
lines were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium
(DMEM) supplemented with 10% BCS or FBS at 37°C in a humid-
ified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. NIH3T3 and ARPE-19 cells
were not authenticated or tested for mycoplasma contamination.
One day before transfection, NIH3T3 and ARPE-19 cells were seed-
ed into 24-well plates at 2 × 104 cells per well, with each well con-
taining 250 µL growth medium lacking antibiotics. For plasmid
delivery, cells were transfected with Cas9 (1 µg) and sgRNA (1
µg) expression plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo
Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. For
RNP delivery, Cas9 protein (4 µg) was incubated with sgRNA
(2.25 µg) for 5 min at room temperature, after which 50 µL Opti-
MEM (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 1 µL Lipofectamine 2000
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) were added. After 10 min, the RNP mix-
ture was added to cells in the 24-well plates described above. Cells
were harvested 48 h after transfection and analyzed using the T7E1
assay, targeted deep sequencing, and qPCR. For VEGFA expression
in confluent RPE cells, ARPE-19 cells were maintained in DMEM/
F12 containing 1% FBS after reaching confluency to allow forma-
tion of a polarized epithelial layer for the experiments (Park et al.
2015b). ARPE-19 cells in 12-well plates were transfected with 8
µg of Cas9 protein, 4.5 µg of sgRNA, and 3 µL of lipofectamine
2000. Two days after transfection, the transfection growth medi-
um (DMEM + 1% FBS) was gently replaced with 0.5 mL of fresh se-
rum-free medium. After 16 h, cells and media were harvested and
analyzed using targeted deep sequencing, qPCR, and ELISA.
Cy3-labeled Cas9 RNP imaging and counting
One day after transfection, cells were fixed in 4% PFA for 10 min at
room temperature and then stained with 4′, 6-diamidino-2-phe-
nylindole (DAPI, 1µg/mL; Sigma Aldrich) for 15 min at room tem-
perature. Cells were visualized with a confocal microscope
(LSM510, Carl Zeiss) at a magnification of 630×. The scanning pa-
rameters were as follows: scaling (x = 0.14 µm/pixel, y = 0.14 µm/
pixel, z = 1 µm/pixel), dimensions (x = 1024, y = 1024, z = 6, chan-
nels: 3, 12-bit) with objective C-Apochromat 63×/1.20W Korr UV-
VIS-IR. Cy3 positive nuclei were counted using ZEN 2 software
(black edition, Ver 10.0, Carl Zeiss). To quantify the frequency of
Cy3 positive nuclei, we counted the total number of cells and
the number of cells with Cy3 staining in the nucleus in a field of
view at a magnification of 630× and calculated the average per-
centage of Cy3 positive nuclei over four fields of view (n = 3).
T7E1 assay
Genomic DNA was isolated from cells and tissues using a DNeasy
Tissue Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
After target sites were amplified using PCR, the products were de-
natured and annealed using a thermal cycler. A list of primers
used can be found in Supplemental Table S5. Annealed PCR prod-
ucts were incubated with T7 endonuclease I (ToolGen, Inc.) for 25
min at 37°C and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis.
Targeted deep sequencing
On-target and potential off-target regions were amplified from ge-
nomic DNA using Phusion polymerase (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
The PCR amplicons were subjected to paired-end sequencing using
an Illumina MiSeq at LAS, Inc. A list of primers used can be found
in Supplemental Tables S6, S7, and S8. Indels around the site 3 bp
upstream of the PAM sequence were considered to be mutations re-
sulting from Cas9 RNP activity.
RNA extraction and qPCR
Total RNA was isolated from NIH3T3 and ARPE-19 cells using an
easy-spinTM Total RNA extraction Kit (iNtRON) according to the

VEGFA ELISA using confluent ARPE-19 cells
For human VEGFA ELISA, serum-free supernatants were collected
from Vegfa-specific Cas9 RNP-treated confluent ARPE-19 cell cul-
tures after cells were incubated in serum-free medium for 16
h. Secreted VEGFA protein levels were measured using a human
VEGF Quantikine ELISA Kit (DVE00, R&D systems) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions.
In vitro cleavage of genomic DNA and Digenome sequencing
Genomic DNA was isolated from ARPE-19 cells (ATCC) with a
DNeasy Tissue Kit (Qiagen). In vitro cleavage of genomic DNA
for Digenome sequencing was performed as described previously
(Kim et al. 2015, 2016b). Briefly, genomic DNA (20 µg) was incu-
bated with Cas9 protein (16.7 µg) and sgRNA (12.5 µg) in reaction
buffer (100 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 100 µg/mL
BAS, pH 7.9) for 3 h at 37°C. Cleaved genomic DNA was treated
with RNase A (50 µg/mL, Sigma Aldrich) for 30 min at 37°C and
purified with a DNeasy Tissue Kit (Qiagen). Whole-genome and
Digenome sequencing were performed as described previously
(Kim et al. 2016b).

 Animals
The care, use, and treatment of all animals in this study were in
strict agreement with the ARVO “Statement for the Use of
Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research” and the guidelines
established
by
the
Seoul
National
University
Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee. Adult (6 wk old) male SPF
C57BL/6J mice were used in the study. Mice were maintained un-
der a 12 h dark–light cycle.
Subretinal injections
Subretinal injection was performed as previously described (Park
et al. 2015c). Briefly, RNPs composed of Cas9 protein (8 µg),
sgRNA (4.5 µg), and Lipofectamine 2000 (20% v/v) were mixed
in 2 µL of injection volume. RNPs (2 or 3 µL) were injected into
the subretinal space using a Nanofil syringe with a 33G blunt nee-
dle (World Precision Instruments, Inc.) under an operating micro-
scope (Leica Microsystems, Ltd.). Subjects with retinal hemorrhage
were excluded from the study.
Laser-induced CNV model
Mice were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of a mix-
ture of tiletamine and zolazepam (1:1, 2.25 mg/kg body weight)
and xylazine hydrochloride (0.7 mg/kg body weight). Pupils
were dilated with an eye drop containing phenylephrine (0.5%)
and tropicamide (0.5%). Laser photocoagulation was performed
using an indirect head set delivery system (Iridex) and laser system
(Ilooda). The laser wave length was 810 nm. Laser parameters were
200 µm spot size, 1W power, and 100 msec exposure time. Laser
burn was induced at the 12 (right eye) or 6 (left eye) o’clock posi-
tions around the optic disc with a modification (Lambert et al.
2013). Only burns that produced a bubble without vitreous hem-
orrhage were included in the study. Subretinal RNP injections
were performed in the quadrant of laser burn. RNPs (sgRosa26 or
sgVegfa) were randomly allocated to the left or right eye in each
mouse. Subretinal injection of Cas9 RNPs produced a bleb. We
confirmed that the bleb overlapped with the laser-burn site.
Subjects in which the bleb overlapped the laser-burn site were in-
cluded in further studies. Seven days later, the eyes were fixed in
4% PFA for 1 h at room temperature. RPE complexes (RPE/cho-
roid/sclera) were prepared for immunostaining with isolectin-B4
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, catalog no. I21413, 1:100) overnight
at 4°C. The RPE complexes were flat-mounted and viewed with a
fluorescent microscope (Eclipse 90i, Nikon) at a magnification of
40×. The CNV area was measured using ImageJ software (1.47v,
NIH) by blind observers.
Immunofluorescent staining and imaging
The number of RPE cells in the RPE complex was calculated by
counting DAPI stained nuclei in paraffin embedded 4-µm cross-
section samples in a high power field area (100 µm × 100 µm, n
= 8). Cross-section samples obtained at day 7 post-injection (n =
4) were immunostained with anti-opsin antibody (Millipore,
AB5405, 1:1000) and Alexa Fluor 488 antibody (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, 1:500). The opsin positive area was measured using
ImageJ software (1.47v, NIH) by blind observers. The intracellular
distribution of Cy3-Cas9 protein in the RPE flat-mounts was im-
aged using a confocal microscope (LSM 710, Carl Zeiss). The scan-
ning parameters were as follows: scaling (x = 0.042 µm/pixel, y =
0.042 µm/pixel, z = 0.603 µm/pixel), dimensions (x = 1024, y =
1024, z = 12, channels: 2, 8-bit), and zoom (5.0) with objective
C-Apochromat 40×/1.20W Korr M27. ZEN 2 software was used to
process the images.
Isolation of RPE sheets and genomic DNA extraction
RPE cell sheets at the RNP delivered site were harvested at day 3
post-injection with or without CNV according to the previously
described protocol (Fernandez-Godino et al. 2016). Briefly, enucle-
ated eyes were incubated with 0.1% hyaluronidase (Sigma-Aldrich)
for 45 min at 37°C after removal of lens, then transferred in PBS for
30 min on ice. The RNP-injected area was separated from the RNP-
free area. Next, neural retina was completely removed from enucle-
ated eyes, and only RPE/choroid/scleral complex was incubated
with Trypsin-ETDA solution for 45 min at 37°C. RPE cell sheets
were isolated by shaking the eyecup using microforceps, and
only monolayer RPE sheets were collected using a glass capillary
on the microscopy. Genomic DNA was directly extracted from
the collected RPE sheets in the RNP-injected area and subjected
to targeted deep sequencing. Briefly, the collected RPE sheets
were incubated with lysis buffer (25 mM NaOH, 0.2 mM EDTA)
for 20 min at 95°C and pH adjusted to 7.4 using HEPES (50 mM).
Mouse VEGFA ELISA
For mouse VEGFA ELISA, a total of 30 laser burns were induced in
the eye, after which RNPs (3 µL) were injected into the subretinal
space. At day 3 post-injection, whole RPE complexes were isolated
from the retina and frozen for further analysis. Cells were lysed
with RIPA buffer, and VEGFA levels were measured using a mouse
VEGF Quantikine ELISA Kit (MMV00, R&D systems) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions.
Western blotting
To analyze RNP levels over time after in vivo RNP delivery, Western
blotting of RPE complexes, obtained at 1 and 3 d post-injection,
was performed. Samples containing an equal amount of protein
(20 µg) were analyzed; Cas9 and beta-actin were detected with
an anti-HA high affinity antibody (Roche, 3F10, 1:1000) and an
anti-beta-actin antibody (Sigma Aldrich, A2066, 1:1000), respec-
tively. ImageQuant LAS4000 (GE healthcare) was used for digital
imaging.
Statistics
Data were analyzed with SPSS software version 18.0 (SPSS, Inc.). P-
values were determined by an unpaired, two-sided Student’s t-tests
or one-way ANOVA and Tukey post-hoc tests for multiple groups.
Data are shown as mean with SEM.
