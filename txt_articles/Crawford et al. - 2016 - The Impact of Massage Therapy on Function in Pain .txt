Abstract
Purpose. Pain is multi-dimensional and may be bet-
ter addressed through a holistic, biopsychosocial
approach. Massage therapy is commonly practiced
among patients seeking pain management; how-
ever, its efficacy is unclear. This systematic review
and meta-analysis is the first to rigorously assess
the quality of massage therapy research and evi-
dence for its efficacy in treating pain, function-
related and health-related quality of life outcomes
across all pain populations.
Methods. Key databases were searched from incep-
tion through February 2014. Eligible randomized
controlled trials were assessed for methodological
quality using SIGN 50 Checklist. Meta-analysis was
applied at the outcome level. A diverse steering
committee
interpreted
the
results
to
develop
recommendations.
Results. Sixty high quality and seven low quality
studies were included in the review. Results demon-

was
also

Introduction
Public Health Significance of Pain
Pain is currently recognized as the most compelling rea-
son for an individual to seek medical attention from a
general practitioner, and accounts for approximately
80% of physician visits [1,2]. It is often represented as a
complex process, affecting individuals differently as the
severity, frequency, and duration of pain conditions can
vary within each condition [3,4]. Pain is an experience
that is multi-dimensional; not only does it impact individ-
uals physically, but also socially, mentally, emotionally,
and spiritually [1,5,6]. As pain persists and worsens, it
can interfere with daily activities, significantly impair per-
formance of social responsibilities in work and family
life, and negatively affect psychological health and qual-
ity of life. In fact, evidence supports the close interaction
between pain and various function outcomes (e.g.,
functional,
emotional,
psychosocial
domains)
which
often affect and intensify each other [7–16]. Effective
pain management thus requires therapies that treat
both pain and related sequela by addressing the whole
patient through a holistic biopsychosocial model.
Massage Therapy for Pain
There has been a rise in the use of complementary and
integrative medicine (CIM) therapies [17,18] due to the
high prevalence of pain, unsatisfactory results from con-
ventional pain treatment, and the need to address the
whole patient. One of the most prevalent and popular
CIM treatments is massage therapy, which involves the
manipulation of soft-tissue to alleviate pain and discom-
fort [19]. In addition to physical relaxation, proponents of
massage therapy claim that it promotes mental relax-
ation and addresses the psychological aspects of the
patients’ health conditions [20]. Integration of massage
therapy in acute care hospital settings has been shown
to effectively enhance patients’ ability to cope with both
physical and emotional aspects of pain [21]. Massage
therapy is also widely used and sought after, because
while it is not totally devoid of risks or complications, it
is generally recognized as a safe therapeutic modality
with few risks or adverse effects [22].
Despite its popularity and wide use, there continues to
be ongoing debate regarding the efficacy of massage
therapy for pain. In a 2013 systematic review, Kumar
et al. concluded that there is an emerging body of evi-
dence to support massage for low back pain but be-
cause of the lack of methodological rigor in the primary
research
interpretation
should
be
cautioned
[23].
Similarly, in the 2010 systematic review exploring man-
ual therapies, Bronfort et al. emphasized the importance
of methodological quality and concluded that there
exists moderate quality of evidence for massage on
chronic low back and neck pain [24]. In 2015, Furlan
et al. concluded that the quality of the evidence was
“low to very low” in support of massage being effective
for reducing pain and improving function [25]. Additional
reviews exist on specific types of massage with various
specific pain conditions, each with varying levels of evi-
dence being reported [26–28].
Research highlights the challenges within this field, the
diversity of types of massage therapies and compara-
tors being used, and the heterogeneity of their thera-
peutic effects [29]. In 2010, the Pain Management Task
Force (PMTF) identified massage therapy as one of the
integrative therapies
most ready for implementation
based on current literature regarding efficacy, safety,
and acceptability as well as licensing and credentialing
concerns. They maintained, however, that there are still
key questions (e.g., whether it is safe, whether it works
for the purposes for which it is used) that have yet to be
answered through well-designed scientific studies [30].
With the move toward more patient-centric healthcare,
and the realization that pain affects the whole person
and needs to be addressed in a more holistic fashion,
there is a need to confirm the efficacy of massage ther-
apy for treating patient-reported function-related out-
comes across all pain populations to better inform
clinicians, healthcare practice and policies as to whether
massage therapy can be considered as a therapeutic
option for pain management.
Purpose
This systematic review and meta-analysis provides an
objective and transparent analysis of the research on
massage therapy for treating patient-reported functional
outcomes related to individuals experiencing pain from a
whole person perspective. This analysis was designed
to contribute to the field in the following ways: (a) begin
to more clearly define concepts of massage therapy
and function as it relates to pain and other clinical out-
comes in order to guide future research; (b) determine
the efficacy of massage therapy for treating individuals
who would typically visit their general health practitioner
with complaints of pain (e.g., patients diagnosed with
various pain conditions across the spectrum of acute to
chronic pain) that is affecting function-related (e.g., pain
intensity/severity, activity, sleep, mood, stress) and other
(e.g., health-related quality of life, pain pressure thresh-
old, physiological outcomes) outcomes of daily life; (c)
describe the characteristics and safety issues of mas-
sage therapy currently reported in the literature; (d)

 propose a recommended set of Standards for Reporting
Interventions in Clinical Trials of Massage (STRICT-M)
and analyze these criteria to guide future work and rep-
licability; (e) synthesize the evidence to draw conclu-
sions based on the current state of the science from
which recommendations can be made for its applica-
tion; and (f) identify gaps in order to guide a future re-
search agenda.
Methodology
Overview of Methodological Approach
A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted
using Samueli Institute’s
systematic review process
known as the Rapid Evidence Assessment of Literature
(REALV
C ) [31], which has been used by a variety of or-
ganizations
to
date
[32–36].
Specifically,
(a)
the
Evidence for Massage Therapy (EMT) Working Group,
composed of a diverse group of stakeholders including
a full steering committee and subject matter experts,
contributed to defining the review’s protocol to maxi-
mize the meaning and impact; (b) the systematic re-
view
team
followed
the
protocol
to
independently
evaluate the quantity and quality of the available English,
peer-reviewed literature in order to (c) present the re-
sults to the EMT Working Group who then interpreted
the
evidence
to
suggest
recommendations
for
the
field. The protocol for this systematic review is regis-
tered
with

CRD42014008867.
Concepts and Definitions
Pain
For purposes of this review, the authors considered
pain as an unpleasant sensory and emotional acute or
chronic subjective experience associated with actual or
potential tissue damage or described in terms of such
damage [30].
Function
Given the multi-dimensionality of pain and its subse-
quent effect on various function-related outcomes, the
authors believe it is important to address pain through a
biopsychosocial approach to best address the whole
patient. In fact, a number of outcome tools are begin-
ning to address pain in this manner [37–39]. As such,
the authors view function as also encompassing pain,
activity, sleep, mood and stress, as well as health-
related quality of life (HrQoL), pain pressure threshold
and physiological (i.e., outcomes relating to one’s physi-
ology including the physical and chemical phenomena
and processes involved) outcomes.
Massage Therapy
The authors reviewed various definitions and taxono-
mies of massage therapy in order to propose a com-
mon
language
system
[28,29,40–43]
through
the
following definition:
The systematic manipulation of soft tissue with the
hands that positively affects and promotes healing,
reduces
stress,
enhances
muscle
relaxation,
im-
proves local circulation, and creates a sense of
well-being.
Study Eligibility Criteria
Articles were included if they met all of the following cri-
teria: (a) human population experiencing pain as defined
above; (b) massage therapy, as defined above, adminis-
tered (i) alone as a therapy; (ii) as part of a multi-modal
intervention where massage effects can be separately
evaluated; or (iii) with the addition of techniques com-
monly used with massage, as pre-defined by the EMT
Working Group (i.e., external application of water, heat,
cold, lubricants, background music, aromas, essential
oils, and with the addition of tools that may mimic the
actions that can be performed by the hands); (c) sham,
no treatment or active comparator (i.e., those in which
participants are actively receiving any type of interven-
tion); (d) assessment of at least one relevant functional
outcome (as defined above), and; (e) the study being a
peer-reviewed randomized controlled trial (RCT) study
design published in the English language. Additionally,
interventions were included if they were not necessarily
labeled as massage or massage therapy but included
the use of manual forces and soft-tissue deformation as
well as gliding, torsion, shearing, elongation, oscillating,
percussive, and joint movement methods (i.e., touch,
compression,
gliding,
percussion,
friction,
vibration,
kneading, movement, positioning, stretching, holding).
Note that interventions solely performed by tools (e.g.,
chair massage) were excluded.
Search Strategy
PubMed,
CINAHL,
Embase,
and
PsycInfo,
were
searched from database inception through February
2014. Authors explored MeSH within MEDLINE and
consulted with subject matter experts to develop the
search strategy (see Figure 1 for PubMed search string).
Study Selection
Four reviewers (LX, AP, CP, EY) relied upon the eligibility
criteria to independently screen titles and abstracts
yielded from the search. A Cohen’s kappa for inter-
rated agreement of > 0.90 was maintained throughout
the
review.
Disagreements
about
inclusion
were
resolved through discussion and consensus, by one of
the review managers (CB, CC) or, ultimately, by the
EMT Working Group.

 Methodological Quality Assessment and Data
Extraction
Methodological quality (i.e., risk of bias/internal validity)
was independently assessed by four reviewers (LX, AP,
CP, EY) using the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines
Network (SIGN) 50 Checklist [44] for RCTs, a validated
and reliable assessment tool widely used in the litera-
ture. External and model validity was assessed using
the External Validity Assessment Tool (EVATV
C ) [45]
which measures the generalizability of research to other
individuals (i.e., external validity) and other settings (i.e.,
model validity) outside the confines of a study.
Data was extracted to describe each included study ac-
cording to the pain condition, sample entered/com-
pleted, intervention and control/comparison description
and dosage, relevant function measures and corres-
ponding results and statistics, effect size calculations,
and author’s main conclusions. The authors also noted
whether power calculations to achieve sufficient effect
sizes
and
adverse
events
were
reported.
Mobius
Analytics Systematic Review System (Mobius Analytics
Inc, Ottawa, Ontario) was utilized for all data entry and
execution of the systematic review.
Proposed STRICT-M Checklist and Analysis
The Standards for Reporting Interventions in Clinical
Trials of Acupuncture (STRICTA) [46] is a formal exten-
sion of the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials
(CONSORT) Statement [47] that expands the general
content of the intervention description specific to acu-
puncture. It is designed to improve the completeness of
reporting interventions in controlled acupuncture trials
so that such trials can provide a transparent account of
both acupuncture and control/comparison protocols.
The authors adapted STRICTA criteria to relate to mas-
sage therapy interventions, and performed an analysis
across these criteria. Specifically, the criteria addresses
design elements such as the intervention’s rationale,
technique, treatment regimen and dosing; other compo-
nents of treatment; practitioner background; and con-
trol/comparator
interventions
deemed
important
for
quality control of massage therapy studies. The authors
refer to this as a proposed Standards for Reporting
Interventions in Clinical Trials of Massage (STRICT-M)
Checklist.
Data Synthesis and Analysis
Meta-Analysis
When reported, the sample size, mean or pre-post dif-
ference, and standard deviation for each treatment
group was extracted. Effect sizes were calculated for
each comparison (i.e., massage vs. active comparator,
massage vs. sham, and massage vs. no treatment) for
the following outcomes: pain intensity/severity, activity,
stress, mood (i.e., anxiety), sleep (i.e., fatigue), and
HrQoL, where available. If a study had more than one
active comparator (e.g., physical therapy and acupunc-
ture), the biostatistician randomly chose one active
comparator for analysis by flipping a coin. A minimum of
three studies was required to perform a meta-analysis
for each subset of data. An unbiased estimate was cal-
culated using the Cohen’s d effect size for subgroup
analyses that pooled data across several scales [48,49].
A pooled random-effects estimate of the overall effect
size was estimated for all studies judged clinically similar
enough to warrant a meta-analysis. The individual trial
outcomes were weighted by both within- and between-
study variation in this synthesis. For a reduction in pain
intensity/severity,

and
fatigue
outcomes,

 negative effect size favors the massage therapy treat-
ment group. For improved activity (i.e., increase in range
of motion) and HrQoL, a positive effect size favors the
massage therapy treatment group. Publication bias was
assessed using the Egger regression asymmetry test
[50,51].
Heterogeneity
was
assessed
using
l2
and
tested via Q statistics. For pain intensity/severity, a clin-
ical translation into the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS),
0-100, was conducted for clinical interpretation using a
standard deviation of 25 points. The authors con-
sidered a 20-mm difference on the VAS as clinically
relevant [52]. These translations should be interpreted
with caution. All meta-analyses were conducted with
Comprehensive
Meta-analysis
version
2.2
(Meta-
Analysis.com, Englewood, NJ).
Evidence Synthesis
The EMT Working Group and systematic review team
convened to review the evidence from the systematic
review and meta-analysis, in order to grade the (i) confi-
dence in the estimate of the effect; (ii) magnitude of the
effect; and (iii) safety as being reported in the results;
and provide an overall recommendation concerning the
benefit/risk
for
massage
therapy.
The
conclusions
reached and recommendations made are in no way to
be construed as clinical practice guidelines, but rather
recommendations about the benefit/risk of massage
therapy based solely on the evidence garnered from the
systematic review.
Results
Characteristics of Included Studies
Out of the 3,678 articles yielded from the search strat-
egy, 67 articles met the systematic review’s inclusion
criteria and included populations that would typically
seek a primary healthcare physician for support related
to pain. In addition, 16 studies on cancer and 16 stud-
ies on surgical pain populations emerged from the initial
search, and are reported on in subsequent articles
within this series [53,54] (see Figure 2 for Flow Chart).
The 67 included articles were published between the
years of 1999–2013, and investigated the use of mas-
sage therapy on musculoskeletal pain, headache, vis-
ceral pain, chronic pain, including fibromyalgia, spinal
cord
pain,
and
venous
insufficiency
populations.
Massage techniques were performed by at least one
practitioner or therapist and primarily consisted of mas-
sage therapy, myofascial release therapy, traditional
Thai massage, and ischemic compression compared to
a variety of active (e.g., joint manipulation, physical ther-
apy, acupuncture), sham, or no treatment controls.
Studies measured the efficacy of massage on pain, ac-
tivity, sleep, mood, stress, HrQoL, pain pressure thresh-
old and physiological outcomes. Treatment dosages
varied from a single 1.5 minute session to a total of
40–60-minute daily sessions over the course of 20
weeks. Among the 67 studies, 32.2% of the participants
were male and 67.8% were female with a mean age of
42.7 years (range ¼ 20–83 years across studies). See
Supplementary Data, Table S1 for characteristics of
included studies as detailed above.
Methodological Quality of Included Studies
According to the SIGN 50 criteria used to assess the
risk of bias, the majority (n ¼ 60) of studies were con-
sidered to be high ( þþ, n ¼ 10) or acceptable (þ,
n ¼ 50) quality, with seven low (0) quality studies. Most
articles addressed an appropriate and clearly focused
question, randomization, dropout rates, baseline similar-
ities, group differences, outcome reliability, and validity
adequately or well. Criteria surrounding allocation con-
cealment and intention-to-treat analyses, however, were
mostly poorly addressed, indicating that the authors of
these reports failed either to successfully carry out, or to
describe these processes at all. Of the six multi-site
studies [55–60], most (n ¼ 5) addressed site similarities
well, with only one doing so adequately. See Table 1 for
full methodological assessment results.
EVAT measures the source population, recruitment and
model validity in terms of the reporting of staff, places
and facility descriptions. Overall, the majority of studies
described recruitment (73.1%) and participation (58.8%)
aspects of external validity adequately in that the popu-
lations being studied and the source from which they
came are understood well enough that results can be
generalized
to
other
patients
in
real-life
settings.
Conversely, most (71.4%) studies described model val-
idity poorly making it difficult to understand the staff,
places and facilities being used in these studies. See
Table 2.
STRICT-M Analysis
According to the proposed STRICT-M requirements
(see Table 3) the majority of studies addressed the mas-
sage rationale (62.7%), as well as the particular mas-
sage technique used within the studies (98.5%), with
many including specific massage terms (56.7%), and
describing both the amount of pressure applied (52.2%)
and location (82.1%) of massage. The amount of time
spent massaging each location (34.3%) as well as the
response sought (22.4%) were not reported by many.
Although dosing varied widely across studies, it was
well-reported by many studies including the specified
number (89.6%) and frequency (67.2%) of treatment
sessions over a specified time frame (83.6%) as well as
the
duration
of
each
individual
treatment
session
(74.6%).
76.9% of the studies that used additional massage-
related interventions, per the authors’ definition (i.e.,
heat therapy, aromatherapy, essential oils, breathing ex-
ercises, music, relaxation, wrist splint), described these
interventions well. Setting was described by less than
half of the studies (43.3%). Though massage was pri-
marily performed in a clinic (n ¼ 14), private practice

 (n ¼ 8), or hospital/medical center (n ¼ 5) setting, mas-
sage was also offered at home (n ¼ 3), work (n ¼ 1), and
rehabilitative settings (n ¼ 2).
Twenty-three studies included only one provider, while
24 included more than one provider and 20 did not
specify the number of study providers. Of those that
included more than one provider, 17 specified the exact
number of providers, which ranged from two to 27 indi-
viduals, while seven did not report such specifics. The
number of providers per site and interaction between
multiple providers was only described by three studies;

 practitioners in one study were responsible for providing
all treatments for their assigned patient, while other
studies included a mix of providers who were respon-
sible for treatments, evaluations or for serving as a
backup therapist.
Almost all studies described the type of massage practi-
tioner (95.5%); however, provider qualifications were
only described by 14.9% of studies. Most practitioners
were massage therapists (n ¼ 24), physical/physiother-
apists (n ¼ 14), or some type of unspecified therapist
(n ¼ 9); other types of practitioners included doctors/
physicians (n ¼ 5), examiners/operators (n ¼ 5), nurses
(n ¼ 4), chiropractors (n ¼ 3), as well as a teacher with
assistants (n ¼ 1). Based on the few studies that re-
ported
practitioner
qualifications,
years’
experience
ranged from 5 to 15 years and practitioners underwent
anywhere from 25 to 95 hours of supervised clinical ex-
perience and 450 to 950 hours of didactic training; most
practitioners also received anywhere from one to eight
hours of training in their respective study’s particular
protocol.
Control or comparator interventions were named and
described
(89.6%)
by
many
studies;
although
the
number
of
sessions
(52.2%)
and
total
study
dur-
ation (52.2%) were reported by several studies, the
rationale (32.8%), frequency (41.8%), and duration of
treatment (49.3%) were described by less than half the
studies.
Adverse Events
Based on a review of the literature, massage is generally
a safe intervention. Most reported adverse events are
minor and have low incident rates [22]. The most com-
mon adverse events associated with massage include
increased pain, muscle soreness, and stiffness [61]. Of
the 67 studies included for review, 24 addressed ad-
verse events in their reports. Eleven [56–58,62–69] re-
ported specific adverse events and 13 [59,60,70–80]
reported no adverse events occurred. Reported adverse
events included soreness, pain, nausea, discomfort,
sweating, and low blood pressure. Only one study [56]
reported pain as a serious adverse event. Two studies
[63,66] reported serious adverse events (i.e., nausea,
shortness of breath, chest pain, prolapsed intervertebral
disc) that were considered unrelated to the treatment
condition in the report.
Evidence Synthesis
Thirty-two studies provided sufficient data to be included
and pooled in the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis as-
sessed the effect on musculoskeletal pain populations

Publication
bias
was
assessed
across
all
subgroup analyses and while this does not appear to be
a concern, it cannot be ruled out due to the small num-
ber of trials pooled across subgroups (see Figures 3A–H
for Egger’s test p-values). Only one study included in the
pooled analyses was of low methodological quality.
Because of this, no sensitivity analysis for methodo-
logical quality was conducted for the meta-analysis;
overall quality was accounted for across all studies for
the entire systematic review during synthesis and inter-
pretation to determine the confidence in the estimate of
the effect (Table 4). Because there were not sufficient
numbers available for pooling across populations experi-
encing headache, visceral pain, chronic pain or fatigue
(e.g., fibromyalgia), spinal cord pain, and venous insuffi-
ciency, effect sizes for pain were calculated for individual
studies, within these subgroups, that had relevant, avail-
able data (see Supplementary Data Table S1). All studies
examining the efficacy of massage therapy in musculo-
skeletal pain populations, regardless of whether they
were included in the meta-analysis, were considered for
the
overall
evidence
synthesis.

 performed in categories with at least three studies (see
Table 4).
Musculoskeletal Pain Intensity/Severity
Massage vs. Sham
Nine studies involving a total of 655 individuals with
musculoskeletal pain compared the efficacy of a mas-
sage intervention to a sham treatment for pain intensity/
severity. Five of these studies (290 participants), most
using the visual analog scale (VAS), were included in the
meta-analysis and resulted in an overall standardized
mean difference (SMD) of �0.44 (95% CI, �0.84 to
�0.05; I2¼58.08%). Translated into the VAS, the reduc-
tion in pain intensity is �11.10 (95% CI, �20.88 to 1.33)
[52]. See Figure 3A. Note that this is a more conserva-
tive estimate of the overall SMD as a sixth study had an
outlying SMD and was subsequently excluded from the
analysis [71].

 While all the massage and control techniques used in
these studies met the definition for massage therapy
and “sham,” respectively, there was still significant het-
erogeneity across studies with varying doses, tech-
niques, practitioner experience and settings that may
influence outcomes. Safety was only reported in three
of the nine studies; based on these studies, massage
appeared to be safe with infrequent adverse events or
interactions, however, due to the lack of reporting,
safety, overall, is not well understood. In addition, there
is
considerable
debate
and
variations
of
what
re-
searchers consider as a “sham” treatment for compari-
son of massage therapy. Further research, moreover, is
likely to have an important impact on the confidence in
the estimate of the effect. Given this, and the high qual-
ity of the studies, a weak recommendation in favor of
massage compared to sham was provided by the EMT
Working Group (see Table 4).
Massage vs. No Treatment
Four acceptable quality studies involving a total of 245
participants compared a massage intervention to no
treatment (typically a wait-list control). The overall SMD
across these studies (219 participants) was �1.14 (95%
CI, �1.94 to �0.35; I2¼84.30%). See Figure 3B. All but
one of these studies showed very large effects in favor
of massage for treating pain intensity post-treatment. It
is interesting to note, however, that this particular study
did show a large effect at 6 months follow-up, with a
SMD of -1.71 at 6 months compared to -0.23 at post
treatment) [78]. Translated into the VAS, the reduction in
pain intensity is -28.58 (95% CI, -48.48 to -8.70) across
the four studies at post-treatment. Two of the four stud-
ies reported either no adverse events occurred or slight
discomfort. Even though the studies displayed some in-
consistency and wide heterogeneity (I2¼84.30%), fur-
ther research is very unlikely to change the confidence

 in the estimate of this effect, and a strong recommenda-
tion was made by the EMT Working Group in favor of
massage therapy compared to no treatment for reduc-
ing pain intensity/severity for those with musculoskeletal
pain (see Table 4).
Massage vs. Active Comparator(s)
Thirty-four studies (involving a total of 3557 participants)
compared the efficacy of massage therapy to an active
comparator for pain intensity/severity. Twenty-four of
these studies (1349 participants) were pooled for meta-
analysis resulting in a SMD of �0.26 (95% CI, �0.53 to
0.003; I2¼79.87%). Translated into the VAS, the reduc-
tion in pain intensity is �6.60 (95% CI, �13.30 to 0.08).
There was large heterogeneity among the types of ac-
tive comparators included in this analysis, as demon-
strated in Figure 3C. All but two of the 34 studies were
either high or acceptable quality with the majority of
studies demonstrating a reduction in pain intensity/se-
verity either between or within groups. Based on the 14
of the 34 studies reporting on safety, massage therapy
appears relatively safe. Further research is likely to have
an important impact on the confidence in the estimate
of the effect. As such, the EMT Working Group provided
a weak recommendation for massage therapy com-
pared to other active comparators (see Table 4).
Three of these studies had sufficient data for pooling an
effect at a 6-month follow-up. See Figure 3D. All studies
favored the active comparator at a 6-month follow-up
(SMD ¼ 0.49; 95% CI, 0.03 to 0.94; I2¼31.20%) though
it is important to realize that the variability in dosing and
duration of both massage and active comparators may
have had an effect on the therapeutic benefit. Further

 investment into understanding appropriate dosing is
needed to better understand long-term effects. At this
point, it is challenging to identify an “appropriate” inter-
vention with which to compare massage therapy.
Activity
Massage vs. Sham
There were seven studies, involving 584 individuals with
musculoskeletal pain, examining the efficacy of mas-
sage therapy on activity outcomes compared to sham.
Three of these studies (211 participants) were pooled
for meta-analysis resulting in an overall SMD of 0.36
(95% CI, �0.53 to 1.25; I2¼89.05%). See Figure 3E.
Based on the two studies that reported safety, massage
therapy appears safe with infrequent adverse events.
Although all seven studies were of either high or accept-
able quality, results were mixed overall, suggesting fur-
ther research is likely to change the confidence in the
estimate of the effect. For this reason, no recommenda-
tion regarding massage vs. sham for the treatment of
activity outcomes is provided at this time (see Table 4).
Note that, while there was an increase in range of mo-
tion with massage therapy as compared to sham, it is
important to acknowledge the heterogeneity among the
studies pooled. Studies tended to use different methods
for measuring activity, highlighting the need for stand-
ardization and consensus building for what constitutes
“activity” as an objective functional outcome and how it
is measured across pain populations for different types
of interventions.
Massage vs. Active Comparator(s)
Twenty-five studies (3063 total participants) compared
the efficacy of massage therapy on activity to an active
comparator. Seven of these studies (450 participants)
were pooled for meta-analysis resulting in an overall
SMD of �0.23 (95% CI, �0.50 to 0.05; I2¼50.73%),
favoring the active comparator (see Figure 3F). Based
on the twelve studies that reported on safety, massage
appears to be relatively safe. While most studies were
either high or acceptable quality, results were mixed,
indicating that further research is likely to have an im-
portant impact on the confidence in the estimate of the
effect. Note that there are various active comparators
used throughout this analysis. It is challenging to inter-
pret this data in a meaningful way without understand-
ing
the
appropriate
comparators
and
incorporating
STRICT-M guidelines to aid with transparent reporting
of both massage and controls. For example, one study
[58] reports that acupuncture may be more effective
than massage therapy for improving activity outcomes,
but massage may be more beneficial than relaxation
[81]. While these patients all have musculoskeletal pain,
the exact area of pain differs (e.g., low back pain, knee
pain, neck pain) and, as such, the various location of
massage and amount of pressure may affect the pa-
tient’s range of motion at follow-up. The variability
associated with this outcome makes it challenging to
assess these pooled studies. No recommendation is
made at this time for massage when compared to an
active comparator (see Table 4).
Stress, Mood, and Health-Related Quality of Life
There were not enough studies reporting on stress,
mood or HrQoL outcomes that compared massage
therapy to either a sham or no treatment control to pool
for a meta-analysis. These are important patient-re-
ported outcomes that are necessary, in addition to pain
outcomes, to understand a patient’s overall health.
Efficient, standardized ways of measuring essential pa-
tient-reported outcomes need to be developed.
Massage vs. Active Comparator(s)
There were 21 studies (involving 2527 total participants)
comparing massage therapy to an active comparator
that measure at least one outcome of stress, mood
(mainly anxiety), and/or HrQoL. All but one was rated as
either high or acceptable quality. Based on the one
study that reported safety, massage appears to be rela-
tively safe.
Anxiety
Six of these studies (210 participants) had sufficient
data on anxiety, primarily via the State Anxiety Inventory,
to pool for meta-analysis, resulting in an overall SMD of
�0.57 (95% CI, �1.06 to �0.09; I2¼63.17%) favoring
massage therapy (see Figure 3G). The majority of these
comparators consisted of either relaxation, physical
therapy, or an exercise. It appears that massage ther-
apy is more efficacious than any of these comparators
for reducing anxiety among patients suffering from mus-
culoskeletal pain. The Egger’s test for publication bias
was significant, indicating that there is a cause for con-
cern when interpreting this data. Further research add-
ing to and investigating the appropriate comparators is
needed and essential for comparative effectiveness re-
search. A weak recommendation in favor of massage
therapy is provided given the current literature base for
reducing anxiety in this patient population.
Health-Related Quality of Life
Four studies (424 participants) assessing HrQoL using
either the SF-36 or SF-12 general health or physical
health status parameters were pooled for meta-analysis,
resulting in a SMD of 0.14 (95% CI, �0.09 to 0.36;
I2¼13.44%) in favor of massage therapy; note, a posi-
tive effect demonstrates an improvement in HrQoL (see
Figure 3H). Again, both the style of massage therapy
and types of comparators used varied. Studies were ei-
ther high or acceptable quality, and the majority showed
statistically significant between or within group differ-
ences favoring massage therapy. Due to the small num-
ber of studies, however, the EMT Working Group
concluded that future research is likely to have an im-
portant impact on the confidence in the estimate of the
effect, and thus provided a weak recommendation in
favor of massage therapy for enhancing HrQoL. HrQoL

 is an important metric when understanding patient-re-
ported outcomes and should be commonly considered
in future studies.
Discussion
This systematic review and meta-analysis found that
massage therapy may be beneficial, with minimal safety
concerns, for treating various pain and function-related
outcomes in pain populations. Specifically, results dem-
onstrate the efficacy of massage therapy compared to
sham, no treatment and active comparators. Compared
to active comparators, massage therapy was also bene-
ficial for treating anxiety and health-related quality of life.
This is the first systematic review attempting to investi-
gate different outcomes of patient-reported functional
domains (e.g., sleep, stress, mood, activity) and HrQoL
across the spectrum of pain conditions from a patient-
centric perspective. Additionally, this review examines
the complexity of different taxonomies of massage to
propose a more coherent definition of massage for the
field, and suggests a set of reporting requirements es-
sential for translatability and reproducibility for future
work. There are methodological flaws that are apparent
across studies addressed in this report, as well as large
heterogeneity that cannot be ignored across studies
which ultimately lowers the overall quality of the evi-
dence; the latter, however, is expected to improve with
education and adherence to clear reporting require-
ments. It is worth acknowledging that this review also
only assessed the evidence reported in peer-reviewed
RCTs available to date. Valuable knowledge can be
gained through the evaluation of other study designs
(e.g., qualitative research). In addition, although a grow-
ing body of evidence based research emphasizes the
importance of human touch in facilitating healing and re-
covery from pain, the underlying mechanisms by which
massage affects the body are still being investigated
[82–84]. Until then, the development of clinical guide-
lines is cautioned against for massage therapy.
Methodology
Overall, the majority of these studies were high or ac-
ceptable quality. While most aspects of internal validity
were adequately addressed, many studies failed either
to successfully carry out or describe allocation conceal-
ment and intention-to-treat processes. The majority of
most studies, moreover, failed to describe model validity
(i.e., staff, places and facilities used) making it difficult to
completely understand how these studies may be repli-
cated and massage therapy implemented.
Because blinding helps reduce the introduction of po-
tential biases, it is an essential component of clinical tri-
als. Of the 67 studies included in this review, a large
number did not mention blinding procedures. While this
review excluded blinding from its risk of bias assess-
ment due to these challenges, the authors did track
whether studies mentioned blinding procedures; regard-
less of whether blinding is possible, authors should
always clearly state who was blinded, or if blinding was
not carried out, discuss attempts made toward blinding
or why blinding was not possible.
Standards for Reporting Interventions in Clinical Trials
of Massage: Proposal to Develop STRICT-M Checklist
Currently, there are no standard criteria or guidelines for
reporting massage clinical trials. This is a noticeable gap
across all studies assessed in this review. For example,
while type of practitioner was mentioned in almost all
studies, practitioner qualifications were only mentioned
by 14.9%. Although practitioners’ qualifications are likely
associated with trial efficacy, specifically an improve-
ment in outcomes [85], this concept is difficult to ex-
plore
as
this
information
is
typically
underreported
[41,86]. Similarly, setting was only described by 43.3%
of the studies, resulting in poor model validity and an in-
ability to fully understand how the review’s findings
could be generalized to other settings. While compo-
nents of the massage interventions, for the most part,
were well-described, the control groups lacked such
data. Replication and validation of the trial’s results are
nearly impossible without this essential reporting infor-
mation. Researchers and clinicians, moreover, are un-
able to make firm recommendations to patients and
policy based on inconsistent or missing data.
The authors propose that in addition to adhering to the
CONSORT guidelines for uniform reporting, the field
should consider the development of a set of reporting
standards (e.g., the authors’ proposed STRICT-M, see
Table 3) for reporting of massage trials and include spe-
cific items regarding the various details of the massage
intervention. Doing so would help standardize the lan-
guage used to describe massage, thus enabling readers
to better understand how massage is defined and how
the intervention, if deemed efficacious, could be repli-
cated in real-life. As noted in the evidence synthesis,
there is a large amount of heterogeneity among the
included studies that needs to be accounted for as it
greatly restricted the EMT Working Group from making
solid conclusions about the value of massage therapy.
Adhering to guidelines, similar to the proposed STRICT-
M Checklist outlined in this report, would help move this
field forward.
Proposed Definition of Massage Therapy
There is wide variety in the types, styles, dosaging, nam-
ing conventions, and practitioner qualifications of inter-
ventions labeled as “massage therapy.” For example,
while drug trials undergo systematic phase trials to deter-
mine consistent and adequate dosing, massage trials do
not carry out such processes and often do not provide
rationale for dose-related variables [41] resulting in incon-
sistent dosages. Further, not only do practitioners vary by
type, with massage falling within the scope of practice
for many different healthcare providers (e.g., massage
therapists,
nurses,
physicians,
chiropractors,
physical

 therapists) but their qualifications vary, as each state has
their own set of requirements with some requiring a set
amount of education hours and others having no such
standards. Given this wide range of variability, it is no
surprise that there are numerous different types of treat-
ments that fall under the umbrella term “massage.”
In order to encompass the wide spectrum of techniques
called “massage,” the EMT Working Group spent con-
siderable time during protocol development defining and
conceptualizing what constitutes “massage therapy.” It
is important that steps toward creating a common lan-
guage are taken so that future researchers are better
able to select techniques appropriate to their research
and
draw
more
meaningful
conclusions.
In
2006,
Sherman et al. created a new classification system to
describe the work massage therapists provide when
giving a massage to patients with musculoskeletal pain
[29]. It is the hope that using consistent terminology will
facilitate standardized reporting of massage interven-
tions, so that more sound research can be conducted
and more definitive conclusions can be drawn.
In addition, there is debate as to what constitutes an
appropriate control for massage therapy. For example,
no treatment control groups do not control for nonspe-
cific effects of attention and touch; resulting in massage
interventions tending to be more successful than such
controls. Wait list controls do not control for placebo ef-
fects and treatment as usual controls may assign indi-
viduals to care that they may have already previously
tried and found unsuccessful. Consequently, massage
should be assessed against controls that are equal and,
for all intents and purposes, identical in order to ensure
effects are truly attributable to massage. Sham controls
(e.g., sham massage, light touch) are promising; how-
ever, there is debate about whether touch control is a
true placebo as touch can elicit nonspecific psycho-
logical effects. In this review, the authors lumped any
sham treatment (e.g., light touch, simple touch, sham
massage, sham acupuncture, sham ultrasound), recog-
nizing that there exists heterogeneity across these stud-
ies.
Future
research
should
focus
on
identifying
appropriate sham controls to truly ascertain the effect of
massage therapy beyond that of placebo, and how
much the effect could be due to the therapeutic alliance
encountered [87]. These are questions that still remain.
Comparative Effectiveness
Comparative effectiveness research is an important part
of future work for massage therapy. However, investing
in comparative effectiveness research in this area is
cautioned until standard guidelines (e.g., STRICT-M
Checklist) are developed to improve reporting and allow
for replication and standardized outcomes addressing
the full patient perspective are used. Cost, patient pref-
erences and values, safety, and benefits all need to be
taken into account before developing a comparative ef-
fectiveness protocol. In fact, before delving into such re-
search, the authors recommend first forming a panel to
design a large, multi-site protocol that addresses the
gaps (e.g., heterogeneity of intervention and control/
comparator
groups,
lack
of
consistent
reporting)
described throughout this report in order to clearly
understand the efficacy of massage therapy. Once effi-
cacy has been determined, a committee can begin
identifying appropriate and cost-worthy comparators.
This review included many small scale trials comparing
massage to various other active comparators, however,
clear descriptions and justification for the use of such
comparators were noticeably absent in many trials.
Research needs to focus on identifying which compara-
tors are most cost-effective and feasible in order to
begin utilizing the same comparators in studies. Until
then, comparators will remain heterogeneous which pre-
sents challenge with interpretation and inevitably stalls
the field from moving forward.
Patient-Reported Function Outcomes
In order to document societal cost savings and ap-
proach healthcare from the patient perspective, it is crit-
ical for massage, and the CIM community at large, to
utilize
standardized,
state-of
the
science,
patient-
reported outcomes as they conduct research in order to
enhance the rigor of the field. Not only would a wide
variety of stakeholders in the US healthcare system take
note, but replication and meta-analysis pooling of stand-
ard outcomes for future research would become pos-
sible. Often, the best way patients can judge the
effectiveness of treatments is by self-reported symp-
toms, functioning and well-being. The National Institutes
of
Health’s
(NIH’s)
Patient
Reported
Outcomes
Measurement Information System (PROMIS) [38] has
developed reliable and valid patient-reported items to
evaluate medical interventions for persons with a wide
range of chronic diseases and demographic characteris-
tics.
The
Pain
Assessment
Screening
Tool
and
Outcomes Registry (PASTOR) [37] is an example of a
clinical pain assessment tool that utilizes PROMIS do-
mains in order to standardize approaches to pain
management. Such assessment tools are not only pa-
tient-centered as they are based on patients’ perspec-
tives and have the ability to be tailored to the specific
individual, but are also typically less time consuming
than using multiple outcome assessment tools. As the
field moves toward patient-centered care and with the
growing realization that pain is complex and needs to
be approached through a more holistic view (i.e., ac-
counting for functional outcomes as they relate to pain),
researchers should consider using assessment tools
based on PROMIS domains in order to produce mean-
ingful, translatable results that can be combined across
studies.
This current review considered PROMIS and PASTOR
domains when evaluating patient- reported outcomes of
the included studies. While the majority of the included
studies reported using valid and reliable outcomes (see
Table 1), a complete examination of these outcomes
was outside the scope of the current review and

 requires further investigation. Because different studies
have different critical outcomes, and researchers differ
in their preferences for what outcome measures are
sensitive to the population at hand, heterogeneity is a
large issue with interpreting results. A standardized, vali-
dated, uniform tool that combines all functional domains
at an individual level is necessary to dissolve the prob-
lem of heterogeneity and allow for easier pooling and in-
terpretation of studies.
While the authors relied on a cut-off point of 20-mm for
the VAS as a clinically important reduction in pain, this
was noted to be interpreted with caution. As detailed
throughout, what constitutes clinical importance may be
better addressed through the whole-person perspective,
beyond that of a reduction in pain to something more
globally measured and including psychological, physical,
social, spiritual functioning in addition to pain.
Patient Preferences
According to the 2007 National Health Interview Survey
(NHIS) [88], 10,000 individuals 18 years of age and over
reported using massage therapy, most commonly for
musculoskeletal conditions in 2002; this number has
since grown with over 18,000 reporting massage use in
2007. Despite the flaws in methodological and reporting
quality and the wide heterogeneity among the available
studies published to date, patients are actively seeking
support through massage therapy. Unfortunately, very
little is known about users’ preferences and the deci-
sion-making process for engaging in such a therapy.
There has also been very little research in terms of cost
and how or if this influences patient preferences. Three
studies [63,75,89] captured in this review performed
cost analyses. One study [89] reported comprehensive
massage therapy had the most benefit but cost more
than soft-tissue manipulation alone. Another study [75]
demonstrated that costs of outpatient services were
lower in the massage group than Traditional Chinese
Medical acupuncture and self-care educational mater-
ials. Although this difference was not statistically signifi-
cant, authors report that initial massage costs might be
offset by reduction in subsequent care, and that the
combination of massage and self-care materials might
prove to be particularly cost-effective. Conversely, the
final study [63] determined that there was no evidence
that massage treatments reduced costs of back pain
related healthcare services during a one year post-treat-
ment period.
Research shows that patients with strong relative ex-
pectations for a specific treatment tend to have better
functional outcomes if they received that treatment [90],
but measures recording patient expectation are often
missing from clinical trials. Only three studies captured
in this review measured participants’ expectation re-
garding treatment success. Two studies [63,66] re-
ported fairly high expectations for massage. The third
article [91] measured participants’ confidence in the
interventions’ success but failed to report the relevant
results.
Clinical Practice Guidelines
Clinical guidelines are an essential ingredient for inform-
ing appropriate healthcare decisions. They have the
power to translate scientific research findings into rec-
ommendations for clinical practice and potentially en-
hance healthcare quality and outcomes [92]. Clinical
practice guidelines take into account not only the scien-
tific research findings collated through systematic re-
views on efficacy, but also the benefit/harm ratios, cost,
acceptability and feasibility. This review has outlined
next steps to guide future research in filling in the cur-
rent research gaps in order to allow for translation to
occur. Once these gaps are appropriately addressed,
the field will be able to move toward developing clinical
practice guidelines that can be trusted. Patients deserve
to have this work completed; pain management is a ris-
ing concern and clinicians need to fill their “tool bags”
with complementary options that will benefit their pa-
tients’ overall wellbeing. The field of massage therapy
can be empowered to charge forward with the recom-
mendations outlined in this review in order to begin to
move toward effective translation.
Next Steps for Researchers and Decision Makers in
Chronological Order
1. Consider this review’s proposed definition of mas-
sage therapy to help resolve the confusion regarding
what constitutes “massage therapy.”
2. Educate researchers about and ensure adherence to
the CONSORT Checklist to enhance reporting and
quality of future work.
3. Study the proposed STRICT-M Checklist, invest re-
sources to formally develop STRICT-M for the field
and
adapt
these
criteria
for
future
protocol
development.
4. Study PROMIS and PASTOR to learn their functional-
ity; consider the whole-patient perspective in all clin-
ical research and use these tools in future work.
5. Invest resources in a large, multi-site study examining
the efficacy of massage therapy compared to an ap-
propriate sham treatment once items 1–4 are ac-
complished
and
ensure
those
components
are
embedded in the robust protocol; track patient pref-
erences and values, expectations of patients and
clinicians, and safety.
6. Explore appropriate comparators for comparative ef-
fectiveness research once efficacy is clearly demon-
strated in item 5; assemble a diverse group of
stakeholders, including patients, to provide input dur-
ing
protocol
development;
track
cost,

 preferences and values, expectation, and safety; con-
duct appropriate comparative effectiveness research.
7. Develop clinical practice guidelines for the field of
massage therapy.
Conclusion
There is evidence to suggest that massage therapy may
be beneficial for improving various patient-reported func-
tional outcomes for populations experiencing pain. There
is clear evidence supporting the efficacy of massage ther-
apy compared to no treatment for pain intensity suggest-
ing that massage therapy, rather than no treatment at all,
should be offered to a patient for pain management.
Compared to sham or active comparator(s), massage
therapy is beneficial across various function outcomes
including anxiety and HrQoL. However, further work is
needed to better promote massage therapy for pain
populations; specifically, future research should consider
this review’s definition of massage therapy moving for-
ward; ensure research literacy and abide by CONSORT
guidelines for reporting and ensuring methodological qual-
ity; adapt the proposed STRICT-M Checklist for essential
reporting around the intervention to allow for reproducibil-
ity and translation; and use standardized assessment
tools that utilize PROMIS outcomes that address the
whole
patient
perspective
in
clinical
trial
work.
Incorporating these elements into a robust, large, multi-
site protocol with adequate resources and stakeholder in-
volvement will allow for replicability, hopefully reduced het-
erogeneity, and ultimately, translation to occur.
