I
ntracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is the most deadly form of 
stroke1,2 and accounts for 10% of all strokes in the United 
States.3 Up to 50% of stroke-related mortality is attributable 
to medical complications.4 Over the last decade, ICH-related 
mortality in the United States has decreased,5 but data on 
the current rates of medical complications after ICH outside 
of clinical trials are sparse.4 The aging population and an 
increase in persons with multiple chronic diseases may have 
resulted in greater medical complication during hospitaliza-
tion; however, many of these are potentially preventable, and 
advances in medical practice and clinical management guide-
lines6,7 may have led to decreased frequency. Therefore, the 
current magnitude and direction of ICH-associated complica-
tions are unknown.
The primary aim of this study is to describe current trends 
in the prevalence of pneumonia, urinary tract infection (UTI), 
sepsis, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism 
(PE), acute renal failure (ARF), and acute myocardial infarc-
tion (AMI) in hospitalized acute ICH patients in the United 
States from 2004 to 2013. We secondarily evaluated the 
current association of each complication with other clinical 
factors, in-hospital mortality, length of stay, and cost.
Methods
Data for this study were obtained from the 2004 to 2013 Nationwide 
Inpatient Sample (NIS). The NIS is the largest all-payer inpatient care 
database in the United States and comprises a 20% stratified random 
sample of all US hospital discharges. Sampling weights provided in 
the NIS allow for calculation of national estimates. Each individual 
hospital discharge in the NIS is deidentified so all discharges were 
considered to be independent. Further details on the NIS design are 
available at http://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov.
Study Population
We identified all patients with a primary diagnosis of ICH (n=116 706) 
by querying the NIS using the International Classification of Disease-
Clinical Modification, 9th Revision code 431 (Methods in the online-
only Data Supplement).
Definition of Outcomes
All complications were defined using secondary International 
Classification of Disease, 9th Revision codes or Healthcare Cost and 
Background and Purpose—Data on medical complications after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) are sparse. We assessed 
trends in the prevalence of urinary tract infection, pneumonia, sepsis, deep venous thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary 
embolism, acute renal failure (ARF), and acute myocardial infarction after ICH in the United States.
Methods—A total of 575 211 adult ICH cases were identified from the 2004 to 2013 Nationwide Inpatient Sample. Weighted 
complication risks were computed by sex and mechanical ventilation status. Multivariate models were used to evaluate 
trends in complications and assess their association with in-hospital mortality, cost, and length of stay.
Results—Overall risks of urinary tract infection, pneumonia, sepsis, DVT, pulmonary embolism, ARF, and acute myocardial 
infarction after ICH were 14.8%, 7.8%, 4.1%, 2.7%, 0.7%, 8.2%, and 2.0%, respectively, but risk differed by sex and 
mechanical ventilation status. From 2004 to 2013, odds of DVT and ARF increased, whereas odds of pneumonia, sepsis, 
and mortality declined over time. All complications were associated with >2.5-day increase in length of stay and >$8000 
increase in cost. ARF and acute myocardial infarction were associated with increased mortality in all patients; sepsis and 
pneumonia were associated with increased mortality only in nonmechanical ventilation patients, whereas urinary tract 
infection and DVT were associated with reduced mortality in all patients.
Conclusions—Despite significant mortality reduction, ARF and DVT risk after ICH have increased, whereas odds of sepsis 
and pneumonia have declined over the last decade. All complications were associated with increased cost and length of stay, 
but their associations with mortality were variable, likely due in part to survival bias. Innovative strategies are needed to 
prevent ICH-associated medical complications.

 Otite et al  Medical Complications After ICH   597
Utilization Project (HCUP) constellation of codes corresponding 
to these diagnoses (Methods in the online-only Data Supplement). 
In-hospital mortality, home disposition, and length of stay were stud-
ied using HCUP variables named DIED, DISPUNIFORM and LOS, 
respectively.
Covariate Assessment
Comorbidities associated with ICH hospitalization were used to 
calculate the modified Charlson comorbidity index for all patients. 
We defined craniotomy/craniectomy, hydrocephalus requiring exter-
nal ventricular drain or ventriculoperitoneal shunt, and mechanical 
ventilation (MV) status using International Classification of Disease, 
9th Revision or HCUP procedural codes (Methods in the online-only 
Data Supplement).
Statistical Analysis
Baseline characteristics of participants were summarized using 
descriptive statistics. We computed the unadjusted national weighted 
prevalence of each complication and in subgroups categorized by sex. 
We further stratified some complications by preexisting conditions 
or interventions expected to influence their occurrence: pneumonia, 
DVT, and PE risk by MV status and ARF and MI risk by chronic 
kidney disease (CKD) and coronary artery disease, respectively. We 
evaluated trends in prevalence of each complication over time by 
constructing logistic regression model with each complication as the 
dependent variable and year of discharge as the independent variable, 
evaluated continuously, with significance of differences in trend over 
time assessed using the Wald test.
We used a series of nested logistic regression models to evaluate 
the association of each complication with hospitalization variables 
and to assess factors that may account for any observed trends in 
complication risks and control for confounding (Methods in the 
online-only Data Supplement).
Results
The 116 706 admissions identified in the NIS represent 
575 211 ICH hospitalizations in the United States from 2004 
to 2013 (Table II in the online-only Data Supplement). About 
49.7% of patients were females, and mean age at admission 
was 68.9 years. The proportion of patients with comorbid 
hypertension, diabetes mellitus, CKD, and baseline coagu-
lopathy increased over time (Table II in the online-only Data 
Supplement; P trend <0.001, not displayed). Most patients 
had low Charlson comorbidity index scores, but the propor-
tion of patients with Charlson comorbidity index score ≥4 
increased from 13.3% to 24.7% over time. MV was adminis-
tered to 26.0% to 29.6%, of patients of which 16.8% to 25.3% 
occurred in the first 48 hours of admission (Table II in the 
online-only Data Supplement). Mean length of stay did not 
change over time, but the proportion of patients transferred 
to skilled nursing facilities increased from 42.3% in 2004 to 
46.9% in 2013 (P<0.001; Table III in the online-only Data 
Supplement).
Total Medical Complication Risks
Over the study period, 29.3% of all patients and 37.1% of MV 
patients had at least 1 medical complication during hospital-
ization (Table 1). The most common complications were UTI 
(14.8%), ARF (8.2%), and pneumonia (7.8%), but signifi-
cant disparity existed by sex and prespecified clinical factors: 
UTI was the most common complication in females (19.8% 
versus 9.9% in males), whereas ARF was the most common 
complication in males (10.6% in males versus 5.9% in females). 
Overall weighted risks of most other complications, including 
pneumonia (9.1% versus 6.4), sepsis (4.8% versus 3.2%), DVT 
(3.2% versus 2.1%), and PE (0.9% versus 0.5%), were ≈30% 
greater in males compared with females (P value for comparison 
<0.001), but AMI risks did not differ by sex. In analysis stratified 
by specific clinical factors, we identified >2-fold higher risks of 
pneumonia and DVT in ventilated compared with nonventilated 
patients. Moreover, ARF and AMI risks were greater in patients 
with CKD and coronary artery disease compared with patients 
with no coronary artery disease and no-CKD, respectively. 
Among those with DVT, 10.4% had a PE diagnosis, whereas 
39.4% of patients with PE had coexisting DVT.
Overall in-hospital mortality was 23.8%, but death risk in 
MV patients was 59.5%. Notably, 61.6% of in-hospital deaths 
occurred in the first 3 days of admission, and 82.4% of all 
deaths occurred within the first week of hospitalization (Table 
IV in the online-only Data Supplement). Among those that 
died within the first week of hospitalization, only 16.4% had 
at least 1 complication compared with the 59.7% complication 
risk in those that died after 7 days of hospitalization.
Trend Analysis
In-hospital mortality decreased from 27.8% in 2004 to 21.0% 
in 2013 (relative decline 24.4%; Figure 1), but the propor-
tion of patients with at least 1 complication increased from 
26.0% to 31.2% over the same period (relative increase 
19.7%; Table 1). The increase in total complication risk was 
driven mainly by a nearly 3-fold increase in ARF risk (4.4% 
to 12.2%) over the 10-year period (Figure 2; Table 1). DVT 
risks also increased by 53.4% (2.0% to 3.2%) but mainly in 
MV patients, and UTI risks increased over time but only in 
females (Figures 1 and 2; Table 1). The unadjusted weighted 
prevalence of pneumonia, sepsis, and PE did not change over 
time, although PE risks in MV patients increased marginally 
over time (Figures 1 and 2; Table 1).
Multivariate Association of Each 
Complication With Clinical Factors
After multivariate analyses including adjusting for MV, odds 
of pneumonia declined by 4% (odds ratio, 0.96; 95% con-
fidence interval, 0.95–0.97) and sepsis by 3% (odds ratio, 
0.97%; 95% confidence interval, 0.96–0.98) for each year 
(Table 2), whereas odds of ARF increased by 9% (odds ratio, 
1.09; 95% confidence interval, 1.08–1.10) per year (Table 2).
Some clinical factors were associated with multiple com-
plications. Compared with whites, blacks had higher odds 
of UTI, pneumonia, and ARF but lower odds of AMI. Atrial 
fibrillation, dysphagia, high Charlson comorbidity index score, 
and Medicaid as opposed to Medicare insurance increased 
the odds of having ≥4 complications. Surprisingly, MV was 
associated with decreased odds of UTI but increased odds 
of all other complications, whereas smoking was associated 
with reduced odds of all complications except AMI (Table 2). 
Although odds of sepsis and ARF were greater in teaching 
hospitals compared with rural hospitals, no consistent signifi-
cant patterns in multivariate-adjusted odds of complications 
existed by hospital region or yearly stroke volume (Table 2).

 Otite et al  Medical Complications After ICH   599
Multivariate Association of Complications 
With Length of Stay, Cost, Home 
Disposition, and In-Hospital Mortality
All complications were associated with increased length 
of stay and increased cost (Table V in the online-only Data 
Supplement, multivariate model 1). Sepsis and DVT were 
associated with the highest mean increase in length of stay 
(12.9 and 10.5 days, respectively) and cost ($35 755 and 
$32 336, respectively; Table V in the online-only Data 
Supplement, multivariate model 1). After mutually adjusting 
for other medical complications, the associations of each com-
plication with cost and length of stay were attenuated (Table 
V in the online-only Data Supplement, multivariate model 2). 
This suggests that some of the increase in cost and length of

stay associated with these complications is mediated by their 
association with other complications.
Similarly, all complications were associated with reduced 
odds of home disposition, but their associations with in-
hospital death were variable. Whereas ARF and AMI were 
associated with increased odds of mortality, concomitant 
UTI diagnosis during ICH admission was associated with 
decreased odds of death.
When evaluating the associations of pneumonia, sepsis, and 
PE with mortality, we found significant effect modification of 
their association with mortality by MV, so mortality associa-
tions of these complications were stratified by MV status. 
Pneumonia and sepsis were associated with increased odds of 
mortality in nonventilated patients but were associated with 
decreased odds of mortality in ventilated patients (Table V in 
the online-only Data Supplement).
Discussion
In this contemporary analysis of the NIS, we found that 29% of 
all ICH admissions in the United States have at least 1 medical 
complication, and any complication risk increased by ≈20% 
from 2004 to 2013. This increase was driven mainly by a >2-
fold relative increase in proportion of ARF, a >50% increase 
in unadjusted DVT risk, and marginal increase in UTI preva-
lence. Whereas AMI risk increased only in patients with coro-
nary artery disease and PE risk increased only in MV patients, 
pneumonia and sepsis risks declined over time. Overall in-
hospital mortality after ICH declined by ≈25% from 27% in 
2004 to 21% in 2013, but death risk in MV patients remained 
>50%. Over 60% of all ICH-associated deaths occurred within 
the first 3 days of hospitalization and over 80% within 7 days.
The high frequency of MV, high mortality in MV patients, 
and huge percentage of all deaths that occur within the first 
few days after ICH are consistent with reports of previous 
studies.8–10 These reflect the high proportion of ICH patients 
who still present with severe or devastating hemorrhage and 
emphasize the need for innovative severe ICH prevention and 
management strategies. However, as more patients survive 
their ICH hospitalization, emphasis is slowly shifting from 
survival to improving ICH-related morbidity and optimiza-
tion of functional recovery. Quantification of disparities and 
trends in complication burden is a crucial step in ameliorating 
ICH outcome because it highlights aspects of ICH care where 
marginal progress has been made and accentuates other areas 
where additional efforts are needed. Complications such as 
DVT are potential quality measures for ICH hospitalization,

but national reference data have hitherto been lacking. This 
study provides a robust assessment of the current national pat-
terns of important medical complications after ICH with addi-
tional information on relevant population subgroups.
A major finding in this study is the exponential increase in 
ARF. Whereas the proportion of patients with hypertension, 
diabetes mellitus, and CKD increased over time and may have 
contributed to some of the observed increase, risks remained 
significantly high after adjusting for these conditions, suggest-
ing that the additional factors are responsible. Potential expla-
nations include more aggressive lowering of blood pressure in 
the acute period of ICH to prevent hematoma expansion4,11 or 
nephropathy associated with increased use of contrast imag-
ing, but no definite conclusions can be drawn using our ret-
rospective analysis. That aggressive blood pressure control 
can increase ARF risk was evidenced in the ATACH II trial 
(Antihypertensive Treatment of Acute Cerebral Hemorrhage 
II), where adverse renal events occurred in 9.0% of patients 
in the intensive blood pressure–lowering arm versus 4.0% of 
patients in the standard-treatment arm.12 Other prospective 
studies are needed to assess these and other possible etiologic 
factors.
ICH patients are at particularly high risk for DVT because 
of their immobility and altered mental status.13 Although DVT 
and PE risks reported in this study are consistent with those 
in previous studies,14 rising risks imply that current mea-
sures to prevent DVT in ICH patients are far from adequate. 
Innovative DVT preventive measures are needed particularly 
in ventilated patients who accounted for all of the observed 
increase in risks. Current guidelines recommending deferral 
of subcutaneous anticoagulation for the initial few days may 
require reappraisal. The observed increase in DVT risk seen 
in our study may be partly because of increased DVT detec-
tion as a result of advancement in imaging technology and 
improvement in clinical practices, but low frequency of DVT 
prophylaxis in ICH patients in the United States may also be 
partly responsible.15 Ventilated patients represent a subgroup 
of ICH patients with potentially greater morbidity and dis-
ability from their ICH, and there may possibly be a growing 
reluctance to use DVT prophylaxis in this group of patients.16 
These factors also need to be evaluated prospectively.
The inverse association of DVT and UTI with mortality 
may reflect early pickup of nonfatal cases of these conditions. 
Similarly, MV patients are usually monitored closely in an 
intensive care unit, thus the negative association of sepsis and 
pneumonia with mortality in ventilated patients may partly be 
secondary to early diagnosis and aggressive treatment of mild 
cases. There could also be some survival bias. MV patients 
are likely to have the most severe ICH and consequently more 
likely to die quickly from ICH before they develop complica-
tions such as DVT, pneumonia, or sepsis. Moreover, the sick-
est ICH patients on MV are more likely to have withdrawal of 
clinical care. In such cases where care is withdrawn, mortality 
is likely greater, and there could be decreased detection and 
diagnosis of complications.
Disparities in odds of various complications with respect 
to race and insurance status may be related to differences in 
timing of withdrawal of care. Compared with whites, black 
patients in the United States are more likely to have care 
withdrawn late and therefore more prone to higher detection 
of complications.17 Black patients with ICH also have lower 
white blood cell counts compared with whites and conse-
quently more predisposed to increased risk for infectious 
complications.18 These factors also need further evaluation.

 Otite et al  Medical Complications After ICH   603
This study has limitations. Although we relied on previ-
ously validated codes for ICH and for complications, we can-
not exclude potential inaccuracies because of coding errors. 
There is great variability in the accuracy of International 
Classification of Disease, 9th Revision codes for medical com-
plications and in how clinicians actually diagnose pneumo-
nia,19 sepsis, and other complications. Our study of trends in 
complications is based on the implicit assumption that coding 
practices remained unchanged over time. However, numerous 
coding guidelines may have led to the improvement in coding 
over time. We were unable to provide information on the clini-
cal and radiological severity of ICH by virtue of inherent limi-
tations in our database. However, we used ventilator status, 
hydrocephalus, dysphagia, and coma as surrogate measures 
of ICH severity and adjusted for comorbid disease status in 
all multivariate analyses. A significant proportion of medical 
complications occur subacutely after ICH admission and still 
contribute to morbidity and mortality, so true prevalence esti-
mates of complications and mortality are likely higher than 
reported in this analysis. Thirty-day and 90-day outcome mea-
sures may provide more accurate information on complication 
burden. Our finding of excess cost and length of stay associ-
ated with all complications should be interpreted with caution 
because we were unable to show temporal correlation between 
complications and these outcomes. Reverse causation is also 
possible. For example, patients surviving and staying longer 
in the hospital for other reasons not related to a medical com-
plication may be predisposed to a DVT as opposed to a DVT 
leading to prolonged hospital stay. We were unable to evaluate 
the impact of withdrawal of care on medical complication bur-
den because this information is unavailable in the NIS.
Despite these limitations, this study represents the most 
comprehensive assessment to date of medical complica-
tions after ICH. Important strengths of our study include 
better ICH case ascertainment by use of clinically diag-
nosed hospitalized ICH. The large sample size of our study 
with national representation and generalizability to all ICH 
patients in the United States provides a comprehensive 
evaluation of the risks, associated determinants, outcomes, 
and importance of medical complications in ICH patients. 
Medical complications are frequent and pose significant 
threats to morbidity and mortality for ICH patients, and our 
findings should trigger increased efforts to prevent them and 
to lessen their burden.
