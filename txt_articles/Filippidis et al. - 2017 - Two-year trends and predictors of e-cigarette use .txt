ABSTRACT
Objective This study assessed changes in levels of ever
use, perceptions of harm from e-cigarettes and
sociodemographic correlates of use among European
Union (EU) adults during 2012–2014, as well as
determinants of current use in 2014.
Methods We analysed data from the 2012 (n=26 751)
and 2014 (n=26 792) waves of the adult Special
Eurobarometer for Tobacco survey. Point prevalence of
current and ever use was calculated and logistic
regression assessed correlates of current use and
changes in ever use, and perception of harm. Correlates
examined included age, gender, tobacco smoking,
education, area of residence, difficulties in paying bills
and reasons for trying an e-cigarette.
Results The prevalence of ever use of e-cigarettes
increased from 7.2% in 2012 to 11.6% in 2014
(adjusted OR (aOR)=1.91). EU-wide coefficient of
variation in ever e-cigarette use was 42.1% in 2012 and
33.4% in 2014. The perception that e-cigarettes are
harmful increased from 27.1% in 2012 to 51.6% in
2014 (aOR=2.99), but there were major differences in
prevalence and trends between member states. Among
those who reported that they had ever tried
an e-cigarette in the 2014 survey, 15.3% defined
themselves as current users. Those who tried an
e-cigarette to quit smoking were more likely to be
current users (aOR=2.82).
Conclusions Ever use of e-cigarettes increased during
2012–2014. People who started using e-cigarettes to
quit smoking tobacco were more likely to be current
users, but the trends vary by country. These findings
underscore the need for more research into factors
influencing e-cigarette use and its potential benefits and
harms.
INTRODUCTION
Uncertainty surrounds the potential
population
health impacts of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes),
and the issue has been dubbed one of the great
debates in public health of our time.1 Research
based on internet searches of available brands has
indicated substantial growth in the availability of e-
cigarettes
in
recent
years,2
which
has
further
increased concern. Much of the controversy has
centred on the degree to which the devices are a
‘gateway’ to smoking cigarettes, their role in renor-
malising cigarette smoking and their effectiveness
in promoting quit attempts.3 Concern has also
focused on variations in potential toxicity of differ-
ing brands, linked to a lack of regulation of their
manufacture.4 The lack of certainty over these
issues has been coupled with calls for regulation at
a variety of levels until these issues can be settled.5
The European Union (EU) Tobacco Products
Directive was passed in 2014 and will be imple-
mented in 2016. Article 20 of the Directive has
brought forward specific regulations with regard to
the reporting of ingredients, emissions, quality
control in production and potential design para-
meters that could mitigate risk.6 Nonetheless, the
debate on other policy decisions, such as bans on
advertising and use of e-cigarettes in public places
or their use as cessation aids, is expected to inten-
sify in coming years. Hence, up-to-date data on the
prevalence of e-cigarette use are urgently needed in
order to inform policy at a national and at a
European level.7 Similarly, as more information on
e-cigarettes becomes available, people’s perceptions
of their safety may change, which may impact use,
as well as attitudes towards regulatory measures,
for example, while rates of experimentation with e-
cigarettes have been found to be high in a number
of settings,8 the evidence is less clear on the pro-
portion of experimenters who go on to become
regular users.9 Reasons for use of these products
and how these may affect transition to regular use
are additional areas of uncertainty. It is also worth
investigating whether e-cigarettes are becoming
more popular in younger age groups or among
non-smokers in particular, as such a finding could
potentially support calls for more strict regulation.
Previous analyses of EU-wide data in 2012 have
assessed the prevalence of e-cigarette use, the rela-
tionship between tobacco and e-cigarette use,10 as
well as sociodemographic variation in e-cigarette
use.11
However,
the
landscape
in
regard
to
e-cigarettes is changing constantly. Therefore, the
aim of the current study was to assess changes in
e-cigarette ever use and in perceptions of its harm-
fulness, between 2012 and 2014, within 27 EU
member states, as well as to explore associations of
regular use with sociodemographic factors and
reasons for use.
METHODS
Data source
W
e conducted a secondary analysis of data col-
lected in two Eurobarometer surveys, wave 77.1
(February–March
2012)
and
wave
82.4
(November–December 2014).12 13 Eurobarometer
surveys are funded by the European Commission.
A similar multistage probability sampling design
was followed in each EU member state in both
waves. Primary sampling units (PSU) were selected
from each regional unit of each country, propor-
tional to population size. A sample of starting
addresses was randomly selected in each PSU, and
households were systematically selected following a
standard random route starting from these initial

 addresses. Following the collection of the data, poststratification
and population size weighting were applied in each country/
region using Eurostat data on gender, age and area of residence,
resulting in nationally representative samples in terms of age,
gender and area of residence. A total of n=26 751 individuals
aged ≥15 years from 27 EU member states, and n=27 801,
aged ≥15 years, from 28 EU member states (including Croatia),
were interviewed in 2012 and 2014, respectively. However,
since Croatia was not included in the 2012 wave, it was
excluded from the analysis; therefore the total sample size in
2014 was n=26 792 (see online supplementary table S1).
Interviews were conducted in people’s homes and in the lan-
guage of the respective country.
Measures
E-cigarette use
In 2012, the use of e-cigarettes was assessed within the
Eurobarometer with the question: ‘Have you ever tried any of
the following products? Electronic cigarettes…’; and responses
included: ‘Yes, you use or used it regularly’; ‘Yes, you use or
used it occasionally’; ‘Yes, you tried it once or twice’; ‘No’; and
‘Don’t know’. In 2014, the question was modified as follows:
‘Regarding the use of electronic cigarettes or any similar elec-
tronic devices (e-shisha, e-pipe), which of the following state-
ments applies to you?’; and responses included: ‘You currently
use electronic cigarettes or similar electronic devices (eg,
e-shisha, e-pipe)’; ‘You used them in the past, but no longer use
them’; ‘You tried them in the past but no longer use them’;
‘You have never used them’; and ‘Don’t know’.
For the comparison between waves, all the respondents who
reported that they had ever used or tried e-cigarettes were classi-
fied as ‘ever users of e-cigarettes’. Among e-cigarette ever users
(2014 survey only), respondents who said that they were
currently using electronic cigarettes were classified as current
e-cigarette users and the rest as former e-cigarette users.
Reasons for e-cigarette use
In
wave
82.4
(2014),
respondents
who
had
ever
tried
e-cigarettes were also asked ‘How important was each of the fol-
lowing factors for starting (e-cigarettes)? 1. To be able to smoke
in places where tobacco smoking is not allowed; 2. To stop or
reduce tobacco smoking; 3. You considered them attractive, cool
or fashionable’. For each factor, respondents could either say it
was important (‘very important’; ‘fairly important’); not import-
ant (‘not very important’; ‘not at all important’); or “don’t
know”.
Perception of harmfulness
Perception of e-cigarette harmfulness was assessed in both waves
with the question ‘In recent years, electronic cigarettes, or
e-cigarettes, have been increasingly marketed in Europe. Do you
think that they are harmful or not to the health of those who
use them?’. Participants could respond ‘yes’; ‘no’; and ‘don’t
know’; for our analysis, ‘no’ and ‘don’t know’ were grouped
together.
Current tobacco use
Smoking status was assessed with the question “Regarding
smoking cigarettes, cigars or a pipe, which of the following
applies to you?”. Individuals who chose the response “You cur-
rently smoke” were classified as current smokers, those who
selected the response ‘You used to smoke but you have stopped’
were classified as former smokers and those who responded that
‘they have never smoked’ were classified as never smokers.
Sociodemographic characteristics
Data were collected on participants’ age (15–24; 25–39; 40–54;
and ≥55 years), gender (male; female), educational level (the
age when they stopped full-time education: ≤15; 16–19 or
≥20 years of age) and area of residence (rural; urban). Financial
difficulties, as a potential proxy for socioeconomic status, were
assessed with the question ‘During the last twelve months,
would you say you had difficulties to pay your bills at the end
of the month…?’ Response options included: ‘Most of the
time’, ‘From time to time’ or ‘Almost never/never’; for the
purpose of this analysis, ‘Most of the time’ and ‘From time to
time’ were grouped together.
Statistical analysis
Descriptive results are presented as proportions (%) with 95%
CIs, while logistic regression results are presented as adjusted
ORs (aOR) with 95% CI. Results are presented by geographic
region, according to the United Nations geoscheme.14 Changes
in ever use and perceptions of harmfulness in each country,
between 2012 and 2014, were assessed with logistic regression
models, adjusted for age and smoking status, as these two were
the most important factors associated with e-cigarette use in the
2012 wave.10 The EU-wide dispersion in ever e-cigarette use
and perception of harm was determined using the coefficient of
variation, computed as the ratio of the SD to the mean.
In order to explore changes in ever use of e-cigarettes and
perceptions between 2012 and 2014 in the EU, a logistic regres-
sion model was fitted with survey year as an independent vari-
able, adjusted for: age; educational level; difficulty to pay bills;
gender; area of residence and smoking status. In order to assess
differences in trends, two-way interaction terms between the
survey year and age, and between survey year and smoking
status, were initially included in the model; however, none of
these was statistically significant and they were dropped from
the final model. A separate multilevel logistic regression was
fitted among respondents who had ever tried e-cigarettes (2014
survey only), where being a current e-cigarette user was the
outcome and independent variables included: age; educational
level; difficulty to pay bills; gender; area of residence; smoking
status; and reasons for trying e-cigarettes. ‘Reasons for trying
e-cigarettes’ was added to the model in a stepwise forward
method, as these may be considered as mediating factors
between
the
association
of
sociodemographic
factors
and
smoking; the significance level to keep variables in the model
was set to 0.10. Finally, we calculated the Pearson correlation
coefficient between the prevalence of ever smokers (current and
former smokers) and the prevalence of e-cigarette ever use at a
country level, in 2014, in order to explore whether variation in
ever use of e-cigarettes could be explained by differences in the
prevalence of current and former smoking.
All analyses were performed with Stata 12.0 and weights pro-
vided in the official Eurobarometer datasets were used in order
to account for the complex design of the survey.
RESULTS
E-cigarette use
Ever use of an e-cigarette in all 27 EU member states increased
from 7.2% (95% CI 6.7% to 7.7%) in 2012 to 11.6% (95% CI
10.9% to 12.3%) in 2014. EU-wide coefficient of variation in
ever e-cigarette use was 42.1% in 2012 and 33.4% in 2014.
Ever use of e-cigarettes in the 2014 survey varied widely
between countries, ranging from 5.7% in Portugal to 21.3% in
France.

 prevalence of ever smokers and the prevalence of e-cigarette
ever use at a country level was 0.28, indicating some correlation
between the two variables. Similarly, several EU member states,
such as Malta (aOR=5.46; 95% CI 2.82 to 10.58), showed
considerable increase in the odds of ever e-cigarette use,
whereas in some countries, the odds of ever e-cigarette use did
not change significantly between 2012 and 2014. Also, within
the 2014 Eurobarometer survey, approximately one in seven
respondents who had ever tried an e-cigarette defined them-
selves as current e-cigarette users—indicating a transition from
experimentation to current use (15.3%; 95% CI 12.9% to
17.7%), with between-EU member state variation ranging from
1.7% in Slovenia to 28.9% in Portugal (table 1).
Perception of harmfulness
The proportion of respondents who thought that e-cigarettes
are harmful increased from 27.1% (95% CI 26.3% to 28.0%)
in 2012 to 51.6% (95% CI 50.6% to 52.5%) in 2014, in the
EU. In the 2014 survey, there was considerable variation
between EU member states regarding the perceived harmfulness
of e-cigarettes, with coefficient variation=19.2% (compared to
36.1% in 2012), and prevalence ranged from 31.1% in
Hungary to 78.1% in the Netherlands. However, in most
European countries, with the exception of Greece and Hungary,
where the increase was not statistically significant, the percep-
tion that e-cigarettes are harmful increased significantly between
2012 and 2014 (table 2).
Factors associated with e-cigarette use
After adjusting for tobacco smoking and sociodemographic
factors, respondents were more likely to report that they had
tried an e-cigarette in 2014, compared to 2012 (aOR=1.90;
95% CI 1.77 to 2.03) (table 3). Being a current or a former
smoker significantly increased the likelihood of having ever tried
an e-cigarette (aOR=23.36; 95% CI 20.86 to 26.17, and
aOR=6.54; 95% CI 5.74 to 7.45, respectively). Also, younger
age (especially being 18–24 years old), living in urban areas and
higher educational level, were associated with higher likelihood
of having ever tried an e-cigarette. Respondents were also
more likely to regard e-cigarettes as being harmful in 2014

 (aOR=2.98; 95% CI 2.87 to 3.09), while those who were
younger, had a higher educational level, less financial difficulties
and who were former smokers, were more likely to perceive
e-cigarettes as harmful (table 3).
All two-way interaction terms between survey year and the
other variables were not significant, indicating that the increase
in the odds of having tried e-cigarettes between 2012 and 2014
did not significantly differ between men and women; between
current smokers, former smokers and never smokers; and so on.
Among those who had ever tried an e-cigarette, those defining
themselves as current e-cigarette users were more likely to be
older. Current e-cigarette users were more likely to have started
using e-cigarettes because they thought e-cigarettes could help
them quit smoking (aOR=2.82; 95% CI 1.99 to 3.99), as well
as to circumvent smoking bans (aOR=1.54; 95% CI 1.19 to
2.00). On the contrary, attractiveness did not seem to influence
their decision to become regular e-cigarette users (aOR=0.74;
95% CI 0.53 to 1.02) (table 4).
DISCUSSION
This analysis of the most up-to-date data from the whole of the
EU
shows that
although
perceptions that
e-cigarettes
are
harmful are increasing, levels of ever use are also increasing.
Those who began using e-cigarettes as a means to quit tobacco
smoking or who used them in order to circumvent smoking
bans were more likely to be current users of e-cigarettes.
Interestingly, the proportion of youth and adults that reported
having
used
e-cigarettes
showed
wide
variation
between
European countries. These differences may be partly explained
by the different prevalence of smoking in EU member states,
considering that current and former smokers were much more
likely to have tried e-cigarettes. This hypothesis is in line with
the moderate correlation found between the prevalence of ever
smokers and the prevalence of e-cigarette ever use at a country
level. Moreover, use of e-cigarettes is also promoted as a cessa-
tion aid and this appears to be an important reason for many
users.15 Thus, availability and access to cessation aids may have
influenced the adoption of e-cigarettes. For example, in Greece
and Bulgaria, where smoking prevalence is high and use of
evidence-based cessation aids low,16 ever use of e-cigarettes was
reported by more than 10% of the respondents in 2012.
Similarly, trends between 2012 and 2014 could have been influ-
enced by a number of factors that might differ between member
states. Such factors include affordability of cigarettes and
e-cigarettes, regulation of advertising and promotional activities,

Tob Control: first published as 10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2015-052771 on 24 May 2016. Downloaded from 
 prevalence of use of other alternative tobacco products (eg,
smokeless tobacco in Sweden) and enforcement of smoking bans
in public places. In the majority of member states, the propor-
tion of respondents who had tried e-cigarettes increased during
the 2-year period between the surveys; most of the exceptions
were countries where adoption of e-cigarettes was already high
in 2012.
Similar to ever use of e-cigarettes, perception of harm and
trends over time varied between countries, even though the
overall proportion of the population that considered e-cigarettes
as harmful almost doubled in 2 years. As e-cigarettes become
more popular, more information becomes available and evi-
dence on potential risks associated with its use is accumulated.17
Perceptions could also be influenced by public health campaigns,
advertising and attitudes of health professionals and public
health agencies towards e-cigarettes. For example, Public Health
England recently published a report highlighting the potential
of e-cigarettes as a harm reduction device,18 whereas most
public health agencies in the EU have not done anything similar.
Even though this report was published after the second wave
of the survey, it might reflect a more favourable stance of
authorities towards e-cigarettes in the UK, which may explain
why it had one of the lowest proportions of respondents who
perceive e-cigarettes as harmful.
Previous
research
has
highlighted
that
the
majority
of
e-cigarette use is among smokers7
10 and that dual use is
common.19
20 However, there are concerns that e-cigarettes
could become popular among non-smokers and possibly serve
as a gateway to cigarette smoking.
Our analysis showed
that non-smokers were much less likely to have ever tried an
e-cigarette, compared to smokers; nevertheless, ever use of
e-cigarettes increased among them as much as among smokers,
between 2012 and 2014, raising concerns regarding their rising
popularity in population groups not addicted to nicotine.
Our analysis also found that around one in seven people
who had ever tried e-cigarettes defined themselves as current
users. Many studies to date have failed to differentiate between
experimentation and regular use, with the exception of some
studies
among
young
people.21
22
Nonetheless,
this
one-in-seven figure is higher than reported in previous studies,
which may reflect either differences by age or other factors.
Additionally, despite its increasing popularity, those who tried
an e-cigarette because they considered it attractive were not
more likely to become current users, which may be in contrast
to the importance of image and attractiveness for conventional
cigarettes.23 This may change as the market for e-cigarettes
grows, and may depend on regulations around the advertising
of these products.
People who started using e-cigarettes as a cessation aid were
much more likely to be current users. The effectiveness of
e-cigarettes as a cessation aid is still being researched,24 25 but it
seems that a proportion of smokers who are trying to quit may
be using it as such.15 Dual use may also help smokers circum-
vent smoking bans by using e-cigarettes in places where tobacco
smoking is prohibited, thus attenuating the impact of smoking
bans. In the present study, those who thought that this was an
important reason to try e-cigarettes were more likely to be
current users—a possible indication of regular use. These find-
ings may provide some insight into the motivation of people
who become regular e-cigarette users and inform policies
related to smoking cessation services and the effectiveness of
smoking bans in public places.
Regarding perceptions of harm caused by e-cigarettes, evi-
dence from the UK on 11–18-year-olds has similarly concluded
that perceptions of harm are on the rise.7 W
e also found that
perception that e-cigarettes are harmful was higher among
respondents with higher education and financial status, findings
that may indicate socioeconomic inequalities in knowledge
about these novel products. However, as the discussion on the
risks associated with e-cigarettes is ongoing,1 it would be inter-
esting to explore how e-cigarette users and non-users perceive
these risks in comparison to smoking.26 27 It must be noted that
almost 3 of 10 participants (29.1%) responded that they did not
know whether e-cigarettes were harmful, which indicates that
there is still a lot of uncertainty regarding the health effects of e-
cigarettes. However, there is now evidence that e-cigarettes
produce potentially harmful emissions, although the potential
harms are most likely less than conventional cigarettes.17
Considering
that
e-cigarettes
are
sometimes
promoted
as
‘healthier’ alternatives to conventional cigarettes, it would be of
more interest to assess whether people consider them equally or
less harmful to cigarettes, but, unfortunately, no such data were
collected in the Eurobarometer. Hence we decided to focus on
people’s awareness of potential harmfulness of e-cigarettes and
grouped ‘no’ and ‘don’t know’ reponses together.

 Strengths and limitations
This is the first study to assess the changes in perceptions and
use of e-cigarettes in recent years, both nationally and at an EU
level. The large sample size and the consistent sampling meth-
odology allowed for reasonable comparisons between countries
and years, despite all data being self-reported and no objective
assessment of e-cigarette use being carried out. The wording of
the questions assessing e-cigarette use was slightly different in
2014, not allowing us to assess changes in current use and
potentially introducing misclassification bias. However, our ana-
lysis was limited to ever use of e-cigarettes and, despite the
different wording between the two waves, there was no ambigu-
ity in which response options reflected at least some use of
e-cigarettes; therefore the bias introduced by this is most likely
minimal. The question that assessed smoking status was some-
what atypical, but was consistent in both surveys. Moreover, any
assumptions of causal relationships should be made with
caution, as the data analysed were cross-sectional; longitudinal
data would allow for more robust conclusions. Finally, current
use was only assessed in 2014, and no data on important issues,
such as duration of use and effectiveness as a cessation aid, were
collected.28
Conclusions
Levels of ever use of e-cigarettes are increasing, and around one
in seven of all people who have ever used e-cigarettes classify
themselves as current users. These trends are against a backdrop
of increasing perceptions that e-cigarettes are harmful to health,
and there are large variations across the EU. Within these two
consecutive cross sectional surveys, the majority of e-cigarette
use is concentrated among current and former smokers, and
people who start using e-cigarettes in order to quit smoking
tobacco are more likely to continue to use e-cigarettes. These
findings provide novel and extensive information on the preva-
lence and predictors of current use across the EU, and they
highlight differences between member states. Further research in
order to identify factors at individual and national level that
may affect use of e-cigarettes is needed, ideally with prospective
studies that could identify potential causal associations.
What this paper adds
▸ Ever use of e-cigarette in the European Union (EU) increased
from 7.2% in 2012 to 11.6% in 2014.
▸ EU residents were more likely to consider e-cigarettes as
harmful in 2014 (51.6%) than in 2012 (27.1%).
▸ Those who started using e-cigarettes in order to quit
smoking or circumvent smoking bans were more likely to
become regular users.
▸ A better understanding of the population-level use and
impact of e-cigarettes within the EU is needed, especially of
the potential impact on smoke-free laws, smoking initiation
and cessation.
