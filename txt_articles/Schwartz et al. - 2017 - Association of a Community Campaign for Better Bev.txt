IMPORTANCE Data are needed to evaluate community interventions to reduce consumption
of sugary drinks. Supermarket sales data can be used for this purpose.
OBJECTIVE To compare beverage sales in Howard County, Maryland (HC), with sales in
comparison stores in a contiguous state before and during a 3-year campaign to reduce
consumption of sugary beverages.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTIPICANTS This observational experiment with a control group
included 15 HC supermarkets and 17 comparison supermarkets. Weekly beverage sales data at
baseline (January 1 to December 31, 2012) and from campaign years 1 to 3 (January 1, 2013,
through December 31, 2015) were analyzed. A difference-in-differences (DID) regression
compared the volume sales per product per week in the HC and comparison stores,
controlling for mean product price, competitor’s product price, product size, weekly local
temperature, and manufacturer.
EXPOSURES The campaign message was to reduce consumption of all sugary drinks.
Television advertising, digital marketing, direct mail, outdoor advertising, social media, and
earned media during the 3-year period created 17 million impressions. Community partners
successfully advocated for public policies to encourage healthy beverage consumption in
schools, child care, health care, and government settings.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Sales were tracked of sugary drinks highlighted in the
campaign, including regular soda, sports drinks, and fruit drinks. Sales of diet soda and 100%
juice were also tracked. Sales data are expressed as mean fluid ounces sold per product, per
store, per week.
RESULTS Regular soda sales in the 15 HC supermarkets decreased (−19.7%) from 2012
through 2015, whereas sales remained stable (0.8%) in the 17 comparison supermarkets (DID
adjusted mean, −369 fl oz; 95% CI, −469 to −269 fl oz; P < .01). Fruit drink sales decreased
(−15.3%) in HC stores and remained stable (−0.6%) in comparison stores (DID adjusted mean,
−342 fl oz; 95% CI, −466 to −220 fl oz; P < .001). Sales of 100% juice decreased more in HC
(−15.0%) than comparison (−2.1%) stores (DID mean, −576 fl oz; 95% CI, −776 to −375 fl oz;
P < .001). Sales of sports drinks (−86.3 fl oz; 95% CI, −343.6 to 170.9 fl oz) and diet soda
(−17.8 in HC stores vs −11.3 in comparison stores; DID adjusted mean, −78.9 fl oz; 95% CI,
−182.1 to 24.4 fl oz) decreased in both communities, but the decreases were not significantly
different between groups.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE A locally designed, multicomponent campaign to reduce
consumption of sugary drinks was associated with an accelerated decrease in sales of regular
soda, fruit drinks, and 100% juice. This policy-focused campaign provides a road map for
other communities to reduce consumption of sugary drinks.

T
he 2012 Institute of Medicine report on strategies
to accelerate prevention of childhood obesity
recommends that communities “adopt policies and
implement practices to reduce overconsumption of sugar-
sweetened beverages.”1(p166) Sugary drinks, defined as any
beverage containing added sugar or nutritive sweetener,
warrant specific attention by public health departments and
advocates owing to compelling evidence linking these prod-
ucts to obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular risk.2,3
Furthermore, as noted in the Dietary Guidelines for Ameri-
cans 2015-2020,4 calories from added sugars should make
up less than 10% of total calories, reinforcing the impor-
tance of limiting calories from sugary drinks.
The momentum of local efforts to reduce consumption
of sugary drinks has built steadily during the past decade. In
2010, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention5 pub-
lished a guide of strategies that communities could use to
reduce consumption of sugary drinks, emphasizing the role
of policy and environmental changes to reduce access to
sugary drinks and promote water. The Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention guide also recommended working
with medical care professionals to educate them about the
harm associated with sugary drinks and screening patients
for consumption. In response, dozens of community-level
campaigns have been initiated to educate consumers and
pass policies to limit access to sugary drinks in schools,
child care centers, and government-owned properties; to
place warning labels on packages; and to tax sugary
beverages.6
Evidence of the effect of these campaigns conducted by
local health departments and advocacy organizations is
sparse. Boles and colleagues7 evaluated a county-level
mass media campaign about sugary drinks, and the findings
suggest that the campaign increased awareness and inten-
tions to change, but did not create measurable changes in
consumption. New York City has taken several actions
against sugary drinks since 2008, including a mass media
campaign and several policy proposals (eg, an excise tax,
exclusion from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Pro-
gram, and a portion cap in food service establishments).
Although the policies did not pass, each led to substantial
earned media coverage of the issue, which may have
assisted in educating the public. Encouragingly, self-
reported consumption of sugary drinks by adults and
youths in New York City decreased substantially from 2007
to 2013.8 To our knowledge, no community-based campaign
has documented its effects using objective measurements of
beverage sales.
Howard County Unsweetened is a multiyear campaign
designed to reduce consumption of sugary drinks through
the promotion of policy, systems, and environmental
changes. Howard County, Maryland (HC), has a population
of approximately 300 000 people and is located between
Washington, DC, and Baltimore, Maryland. The present
study presents data on HC supermarket retail sales of bever-
ages before (January 1 through December 31, 2012) and dur-
ing the first 3 years of the campaign (January 1, 2013,
through December 31, 2015).
Methods
Intervention
In 2012, the Horizon Foundation and several community part-
ners planned a multicomponent campaign to reduce sugary
drink consumption in HC. The official launch occurred in De-
cember 2012, and campaign activities have taken place since
2013. The initiative was designed to address all levels of the
social ecological model.9 Table 1 details the many compo-
nents of the campaign, which promoted change at the inter-
personal, organizational, community, and policy levels.10-22
Through extensive community outreach, a range of partners
were engaged, including faith-based groups, businesses, the
county school system, child care providers, local govern-
ment agencies, pediatricians, and the health care system. The
present analysis of sales data did not involve human subjects
and was deemed exempt from institutional review board ap-
proval by the University of Connecticut.
HowardCountyUnsweetenedtargetedbeveragesthatcon-
tainedanytypeofaddedsugarandencouragedpeopletomove
away from sugary drinks and toward those lower in sugar and
calories (defined as better beverages). The sugary drinks most
frequently identified in campaign materials through pictures
and words were regular soda, sports drinks, and fruit drinks.
Sweetenedflavoredwaters,sweetenedteas,andsweethotbev-
erages (eg, flavored coffee drinks) were also included in some
communications. The beverage most often promoted was wa-
ter, including bottled, plain tap, and tap water flavored with
pieces of whole fruit, vegetables, and herbs. Diet soda was not
addressed explicitly by the campaign, although it was desig-
nated as a better choice in the Better Beverage Finder.10 One
hundred percent juice was also designated as a better bever-
age; however, materials included the caveat that portion size
matters and provided age-appropriate limits.
During the 3-year period, the media campaign alone
reached more than 576 000 nonunique county residents and
created 17 million impressions through cable and broadcast
television advertising, television advertising, digital market-
ing advertising, direct mail, outdoor and facility advertising,
and social media. The campaign also benefited from signifi-
cant additional earned media in response to the public dis-
course surrounding the proposed policy changes. In this con-
text, earned media is the free publicity gained through
Key Points
Question Are campaigns to decrease consumption of sugary
drinks associated with decreases in beverage purchases from local
supermarkets?
Findings This observational experiment with a control group
measured supermarket beverage sales before and during a 3-year
community campaign. Regular soda sales decreased by 19.7%,
fruit drink sales decreased by 15.3%, and juice sales decreased by
15.0%, changes significantly larger than those observed in the
control stores.
Meaning A community public health policy campaign targeting
sugary drinks had a measurable effect on retail beverage sales.

Better Beverage
Finder10
This online tool, powered by national nutrition standards
compiled by the Rudd Center, aims to help residents
search for more than 300 beverage options with less
sugar and calories. It provides the nutrition content of
chosen beverages and where to purchase them in the
county. The Better Beverage Finder had 159 641 page
views through 2015.
Howard County
Unsweetened
Street Teams
The campaign hired professional marketers in 2013 and
2014 to set up and staff booths at neighborhood summer
and fall events (eg, 4th of July fireworks), swimming
pools, sporting events, etc, with the goal of educating
residents about the Better Beverage Finder and collecting
contact information from supporters. These marketers
had 5200 active conversations with residents during
both deployments and distributed more than 2400
samples of healthy drinks.
Organizational Levelb
Hopkins Medicine
Healthy Beverage
Initiative11
Howard County [Maryland] General Hospital, a member
of Hopkins Medicine, launched an initiative in 2014 to
make healthier drinks more widely available and
affordable on the hospital campus. Only healthier drinks
are provided at Johns Hopkins–sponsored meetings and
events. Healthier drinks sold on site cost less per ounce
and receive more prominent placement than sugary
drinks. Sugary drinks that are available are sold in
containers of 12 oz or less. Howard County General
Hospital is the third largest private employer in Howard
County and employs more than 1000 county residents.
In 2015 alone, nearly 60 000 adult county residents were
admitted to the hospital or visited its emergency
department.
Healthy Play
Campaign12
In 2015, a local soccer league launched a program to
educate young players about proper nutrition and fitness
and is working to develop, source, and test a healthy
concession menu.
AAP Pediatric
Obesity
Collaborative13
The Maryland Chapter of the AAP launched a 9-mo,
quality improvement, learning collaborative in 2015 to
improve health care professionals’practice behaviors
related to the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of
childhood obesity and related diseases. Thirteen
practices and 40 health care professionals participated
and met 8 of 9 quality measure goals by the end of the
collaborative. Additional resources were developed to
help support practice transformation and provide proper
counseling on sugary drink consumption.
Better Choices
Coalition13,14
In 2014, the campaign formed the Better Choices
Coalition to work with community organizations, faith
groups, and businesses to improve the food environment
in those settings. Almost 50 local community
organizations have agreed to improve the food and drink
they offer at meetings, improve vending machine
selections, and educate their members, clients, and
visitors about the dangers of sugary drink consumption.
A comprehensive toolkit offered to members includes
social media posts, newsletter articles, posters,
handouts, activities, and more.
Maryland Dental
Action Coalition
The Maryland Dental Action Coalition and state and local
dentist and dental hygienist groups have been developing
best-practice guidelines related to counseling about
consumption of sugary drinks. The project began with a
survey that was sent to every licensed dentist and dental
hygienist in the state (8846; completion rate, 15%). The
survey queried oral health care professionals about their
sugary drink counseling and other practice behaviors
related to obesity and caries prevention. Once practice
guidelines are developed, they will be vetted with state
professional groups and adopted as best practices for
oral health care practices and professionals.
Eat, Play, Grow in
Head Start15
In 2015, the local Head Start programs adopted this
11-week curriculum based on a program created by the
National Institutes of Health and Children’
s Museum of
Manhattan. This curriculum teaches young children about
healthy nutrition and physical activity and involves
parents in classroom learning and take-home activities.
Two hundred sixty-four Head Start students participated
in weekly classroom activities, and 39 families attended
additional monthly family-night sessions.

Healthy Child
Care program
A local nonprofit, Healthy Howard, launched this program
in 2013 to help child care facilities provide healthier
drinks to children in their care, better support mothers
who are breastfeeding, and reduce noneducational screen
time. More than 70 child care facilities were certified as
healthy child care facilities during a 2-y period.

Joint data
collection and
priority setting
In 2012, 4 major community health institutions joined
forces to field a biennial community health survey to
serve as a joint strategic planning tool. As a result, these
organizations have similar strategic planning goals,
including helping to keep children and adults at a healthy
weight.
Your Voice, Your

documentary
contest
In 2014, the Horizon Foundation held a youth
documentary contest related to sugary drinks and their
effect in the community. Youth teams submitted 10
entries. About 200 youth and their families attended the
red-carpet community celebration where the winning
video was revealed and aired. Subsequently, the winning
video received more than 80 000 views on social media.
Sugar Free Kids
Maryland
Coalition16
This coalition of 240 members formed to build on the
work of Howard County Unsweetened and advance sugary
drink policy statewide. Since its inception in 2014, the
coalition’
s work appeared in state-wide print/online news,
on the radio, or on television news more than 150 times,
including 3 front-page appearances in the Baltimore Sun.
Community
partnerships
The Horizon Foundation established partnerships with
several key community groups (eg, PATH, HCPSS, AACR,
and the LHIC) to serve as key hubs for improving the food
and physical activity environment in the county. PATH
members include 12 county faith institutions, the
teachers’union, and other nonprofit affiliates. The AACR
has 14 organizational members, and the LHIC has more
than 40 organizational members.
Howard County
Unsweetened
media
campaign17
Since 2013, the campaign has aired 30-s spots on cable
television stations, run digital advertisements on a variety
of internet sites, sent direct mail to county households,
and used earned media strategies to educate the public
about campaign activities. The cable and broadcast
television spots had 1 067 582 impressions. The digital
marketing advertisements (eg, banner, digital video) had
6 578 184 impressions. The campaign regularly posted
information on several social media channels, including
Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Pinterest. The social
media campaign had 6 056 137 impressions. Direct mail
led to 24 151 impressions. Outdoor and facility
advertising (eg, mall and grocery store) led to 3 562 498
impressions. Together the media campaign generated
more than 17 million impressions with a documented
reach of more than 576 855 residents. Key targeted
audiences (eg, parents with children younger than 18 y)
likely viewed more campaign messages than the general
population.
Joint Chamber of
Commerce Study
on Obesity18
Working with the local chamber of commerce, the Horizon
Foundation commissioned a study to examine the fiscal
effect of obesity on county businesses. Study results were
the subject of a Chamber of Commerce luncheon that
attracted more than 200 business and community leaders.
Policy Leveld
School Policy
Wellness Policy
Update19-21
Since 2013, the Foundation and its community partners
have been working together with the HCPSS to improve
the school food and nutrition environment and to update
the school wellness policy to be more reflective of best
practices. Using its Wellness School Assessment Tool
policy scoring system, the Rudd Center determined that
the new wellness policy ranked in the top third of the
nation after modifications. As a result of the policy,
student-accessible vending machines were removed from
middle schools and all food and beverages offered or sold
by the school system were required to meet Institute of
Medicine nutrition standards. Nearly 55 000 students
(prekindergarten to 12th grade) were enrolled in the
HCPSS for the 2015-2016 school year. They and their
families are directly affected by the wellness policy and
choices made by the school system to promote good
nutrition. In addition, about 500 residents were involved
in the formation of the policy and efforts to get the Board
of Education to ratify it.

publication of online and print news stories. Successful policy
changes during the study period included a state-wide policy
removing sugary drinks from child care facilities, a local school
wellness policy that required healthier food and drinks to be
served during the school day and in vending machines, and a
healthy vending policy for all county government property.
Residents of HC were also exposed to media coverage of Mary-
land statewide campaigns to remove the sales tax from bottled
water and a bill to require a healthy default beverage in chil-
dren’
s meals in restaurants.
Evaluating the Campaign With Supermarket Sales Data
IRI is a commercial company that analyzes scanner data for the
consumer packaged goods industry. One IRI service includes
conducting quantitative studies to measure the effect of spe-
cific advertising campaigns on subsequent sales. We hired IRI
to perform the same type of advertising analysis to deter-
mine whether Howard County Unsweetened was associated
with a measurable change in sales of sugary drinks.
We requested data for all 17 full-service chain supermar-
kets in the county, but 2 retailers would not release data, leav-
ing a sample of 15 HC stores. We purchased scanner data for
the top-selling brands from the 3 largest beverage companies
(Coca-Cola Co, PepsiCo, and Dr Pepper Snapple Group) in the
regular soda (13 brands), sports drink (2 brands), and diet soda
(7 brands) categories. We also purchased data for the brands
with the highest sales in the 100% juice (4 brands) and fruit
drink (6 brands) categories. The sports drinks and fruit drinks
in the study were all regular (ie, not diet) varieties that con-
tain added sugar. Owing to data use restrictions, the names of
the specific brands included cannot be reported. The data set
included weekly sales information (dollar sales, volume sales
in fluid ounces, and unit sales) for each individual UPC code.
In the analyses, each brand is considered a single product and
the volumes are combined across different sized packages (eg,
2-L bottles, 12-fl oz cans [to convert fluid ounces to millili-
ters, multiply by 30]) to calculate total fluid ounces sold per
product, per week, within each supermarket.
The method IRI used to test advertising campaigns is the
Matched Market Test.26 The Matched Market Test measures
sales for the target (ie, advertised) brand and the other brands
inthecategoryfor52weeksbeforethecampaignbegins(eTable
1intheSupplementincludesmaterialsformarketingtermdefi-
nitions). Sales are assessed in stores located where the adver-
tising campaign is planned (the test market) and a set of con-
trol stores in another location that have been identified as the
best match during the previous 52 weeks for sales of the tar-
get brand and category (the control market). To identify the
control market, IRI considers qualitative and quantitative fac-
tors and avoids markets where other tests have recently oc-
curred that may affect sales. The details of the statistics used
in the matching protocol are proprietary, but the concepts are
described in the marketing literature.26
To identify the best-matched control stores, IRI exam-
ined beverage sales for each category of interest during the 52
weeks from May 29, 2011, to May 20, 2012, in HC supermar-
kets. These data were compared with a sample of 326 super-
marketsthatincludedthesameHCchainsandwereinthesame
region of the country. From that pool, IRI identified a set of 17
stores in southeastern Pennsylvania that provided the best
match. The HC stores were from 6 large supermarket chains,
and all of the final sample in the contiguous state were drawn
from 4 of those chains.
Because the stores vary in size and the control stores were
bigger than the HC stores, the matching protocol controlled for
store size using a metric termed all-commodity volume, which
is the total amount of sales in US dollars across all products in
a supermarket. The sales in US dollars for a specific category
are converted into a value that reflects the sales as a propor-
tion of $1 million all-commodity volume. Figure 1 illustrates
the match between HC (test market) and comparison (control
market) stores at baseline for regular soft drink volume sales
per$1millionall-commodityvolume.Thesimilarlevelandpat-
tern of sales during the 52 weeks indicate that the HC and com-
parison stores are a good match.
Statistical Analysis
We compared the changes over time in volume sales of each
beverage category for HC and comparison stores using differ-
ence-in-differences (DID) regression. We used STATA soft-

Maryland Healthy
Eating and
Physical Activity
in Childcare Act
In 2014, Sugar Free Kids Maryland successfully advocated
for the passage of this state law that requires facilities to
only serve drinks with no added sweetener (ie, water,
plain low-fat or nonfat milk, or small amounts of 100%
fruit juice) to children in their care, to better support
mothers who are breastfeeding, and to reduce
noneducational screen time. Many of these standards are
based on the successful Healthy Child Care program.
More than 10 000 Howard County children are annually
cared for in a licensed child care facility (ie, those subject
to this state law).
Healthy Food and
Beverage Options
on County
Property22-25
The Foundation and its community partners have been
working to make healthier food and drinks more widely
available, accessible, and noticeable on county property
and in county programs since Howard County
Unsweetened began. Four distinct policy campaigns
related to this process have occurred. The most recent
policy campaign in the summer of 2015 resulted in the
enactment of a county ordinance. As a result, 75% of the
food and drinks offered in county-operated food and
beverage vending machines and all packaged food and
drinks offered as part of youth-oriented programs must
meet national nutrition standards. Once fully
implemented, this law will affect 2800 county
employees, 1500 children in county child care programs,
and nearly 3 million visitors to the county library system.
News coverage about the county’
s healthy vending policy
debate appeared in statewide or local print/online news,
on the radio, or on television news more than 60 times
since the inception of the first campaign. Nearly 1500
residents directly participated in these policy efforts in
some way.

Comparing the Supermarket Neighborhoods
Although the comparison stores were selected based on sales
of sugary drinks, additional information about HC stores and
the communities where the comparison stores were located
were drawn from the US Census Bureau 2015 and the Ameri-
canCommunitySurvey1-yearestimatesfrom2012,2013,2014,
and 2015.27 The address of each supermarket was used to iden-
tify the closest high school, and the demographic data from
each high school were obtained by school district and each
state’
sDepartmentofEducationwebsites.28,29Thehighschool
profiles included race, ethnicity, and the percentage of stu-
dents who qualify for free or reduced-price federal meals. Stu-
dents who live in households with incomes under 130% of the
poverty level qualify for free meals, and households under
185% of the poverty level qualify for reduced-price meals.
Results
Demographic Variables
The 17 comparison stores are spread over 7 counties in Penn-
sylvania; thus, the data from these counties were combined
for comparison with the HC stores (eTable 2 in the Supple-
ment). In 2012, HC had a population of 299 430 and a median
income of $108 844, and 95.1% of residents had at least a high
school diploma. In contrast, in 2012 the comparison counties
were somewhat bigger (population 350 637 people), had a sub-
stantially lower median income ($53 713), and had a lower rate
of residents with at least a high school diploma (86.2%). Ex-
aminationofthehighschooldemographicdatarevealedamore
complex picture (eTable 3 in the Supplement). Although the
mean income in HC was quite high, substantial household in-
come differences existed across neighborhoods. Among the 10
high schools that surround the HC stores, the rate of students
who qualified for free or reduced meals ranged from 4.0% to
40.0%, with a mean of 23.4%. In the comparison high schools,
the rates ranged from 13.0% to 54.0%, with a mean of 27.7%.
These data suggested that a considerable number of students
in both communities lived in households with incomes be-
low 185% of the poverty line.
The racial/ethnic profile of the 2 sets of communities also
differed. The HC schools were substantially more racially and
ethnically diverse, with a mean of 37.5% white, 28.2% black,
16.0% Asian, and 11.7% Hispanic students. The schools around
the comparison stores had a mean of 74.0% white, 7.1% black,
4.4% Asian, and 13.0% Hispanic students. In sum, HC resi-
dents were wealthier, more educated, and more racially and
ethnically diverse than the residents near the comparison
stores.

during the 4 years of the study for HC and comparison stores.
Table 3 presents the DID analysis by beverage category.
For regular soda, the adjusted mean sales in HC stores de-
creased (−19.7%) from 2012 to 2015, while sales of the same
13 regular soda products remained stable (0.8%) in the com-
parison stores, leading to a net significant difference of vol-
ume sales per product per store per week (P < .001). For the 2
brands of sports drinks, sales decreased steadily during the 3
study years in HC stores (−25.1%), while the pattern for sports
drink sales in the comparison stores rose and fell, resulting in
a final decrease (−7.9%). The change in the comparison stores
for sports drinks sales was not significantly different than that
in the HC stores (P = .51). Sales of the 6 brands of fruit drinks
decreased in HC stores (−15.3%), with the largest drop from
years 1 to 2 of the campaign. Fruit drink sales in the compari-
son stores increased and then decreased again to baseline lev-
els and stayed steady through 2015 (−0.6%). The difference be-
tweenHCandcomparisonstoreswassignificantforfruitdrinks
(P < .001).
Sales of Nonsugary Drinks
Diet soda was not targeted in the campaign and was included
as a better beverage choice in campaign materials. However,
sales of diet soda for the 7 brands assessed decreased in HC
(−17.8%)andcomparison(−11.3%)stores,althoughthefinaldif-
ference between the communities was not statistically signifi-
cant (P = .13). Similarly, although 100% juice was not tar-
geted in the campaign, sales of the 4 leading brands decreased
in HC stores (−15.0%), while they remained stable in compari-
son stores (−2.1%). At the end of the 3 years, the drop in 100%
juice sales was significantly greater in HC than comparison
stores (P < .001).

Adjusted Weekly Volume Sales
To visualize the campaign effect, we graphed adjusted weekly
volume sales for all products. The data for regular soda sales
are illustrated in Figure 2, which presents adjusted weekly vol-
ume sales of regular soda from 2012 through 2015 for HC and
comparison stores. The weekly data are smoothed using a 48-
week moving mean. The dashed line represents the esti-
mated volume sales in HC stores; these are the sales that would
have been expected in HC without exposure to the cam-
paign. The estimated sales in HC stores were calculated by ad-
justing the intercept of the volume sales in comparison stores.
eFigures 1 through 4 in the Supplement contain graphs of the
moving means of the adjusted weekly volume sales for the
otherbeveragecategories(sportsdrinks,fruitdrinks,dietsoda,
and 100% juice).
Discussion
A county-level campaign targeting sugary drinks with inter-
personal, organizational, community, and policy interven-
tions was associated with a nearly 20% reduction during the
3 study years in regular soda sales of the top-selling 13 brands
atsupermarkets.Thisdecreasewassignificantlydifferentfrom
the flat sales observed in the comparison stores and greater
than the small decrease in national sales reported in 2013
(−3.0%) and 2014 (−0.9%).30 This study is the first, to our
knowledge, to use retail beverage sales data and identify a set
of matched comparison stores a priori to rigorously evaluate
community-based policy, systems, and environmental inter-
ventions. These findings support the hypothesis that commu-
nity-based interventions aimed at changing attitudes and ac-
cess to sugary drinks through policies can meaningfully
influence purchasing behavior at the supermarket.
Diet soda sales also declined in the present study in HC and
comparisonstores,whichisconsistentwithnationaltrends.The
factthatdietsodasalesdidnotincreaseinHCstoressuggeststhat
people do not necessarily switch to diet soda when they stop
drinkingregularsoda.Highlightinghealthconcernsaboutregu-
larsodamayalsotriggerconcernsabouttheartificialsweetener
in diet soda. Previous research on parental attitudes about sug-
ary drinks suggests that although parents are concerned about
sugar in their children’
s drinks, they are even more concerned
about artificial sweeteners.31 Therefore, the public health mes-
saginginthiscommunitytothinkaboutwhatchildrenaredrink-
ing may have also deterred purchases of diet soda.
The significant decrease in 100% juice sales was some-
what surprising because the campaign did not directly target
juice. However, campaign materials featured messages that
cautioned residents about appropriate portion sizes of 100%
juice. Raising awareness about the danger of consuming added
sugar in beverages may have led to concern about consuming
the naturally occurring sugar in 100% juice.
Limitations and Strengths
This study has limitations. First, the study only included sales
data from supermarkets. Sugary drinks can be purchased from
restaurants and other retail outlets, such as drug stores; con-
venience stores; and mass merchandisers, such as Walmart.32
To address the question of the proportion of sugary drink pur-
chases that occur at the supermarket, we contacted the Uni-
versity of North Carolina Global Food Research Program. They
analyzed Nielsen Homescan data and found that the propor-
tion of sales of sugary drinks from chain grocery stores in 2012,
2013, and 2014 was 50.7%, 52.4%, and 50.2%, respectively, in
the Baltimore market and 61.9%, 60.0%, and 62.8%, respec-
tively, in the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, market (Shu Wen Ng,
PhD,electroniccommunication,November2,2016).Thesedata
suggest that supermarkets remain the largest single source of
sugary drinks in the areas closest to the stores in our study, and
more importantly, the proportion of sales in supermarkets re-
mained consistent during the study period.
A second limitation concerns the unanswered questions of
howdemographiccharacteristicspredictresponsivenesstocam-
paignsofthistype.WedonotknowwhichgroupsofHCresidents
were most responsive to the campaign. Furthermore, the HC
community and those surrounding the comparison stores dif-
fered on a few demographic points. Howard County has a
wealthier, more diverse, and more educated population, and
thesecharacteristicsmaybeassociatedwithagreaterreceptive-
nesstothemessagesinthecampaign.Thischallengeisendemic
toobservationalstudiesbecausesuchcommunitiesareoftenthe
vanguardofpoliciesthatpromotepublichealth.Inlightofthis,
thefindingsinthepresentstudymayrepresentthebest-casesce-
nario for the effectiveness of a campaign. Future research can
comparethesefindingswiththoseofotherlocations,wherecon-
certedeffortsaretakingplacetodecreasesugarydrinkconsump-
tion. The recent passage of sugary drink taxes in Philadelphia;
Boulder, Colorado; and several cities in California will provide
interesting opportunities to examine sales of sugary drinks in a
range of communities.
Third, these data do not tell us what people are drinking
instead of the brands included in the study. The beverage in-
dustry is transforming quickly, and new products are intro-
duced each year. We focused on the best-selling major brands
within each category to ensure we could measure the same
products each year. However, HC consumers may have shifted
to beverages from small companies that are marketed as
healthy alternatives, such as organic sodas or low-sugar iced
teas. Future work should follow the sales of these smaller
brands in the HC and comparison stores to determine whether
consumers are shifting to other products and, in turn, how
sugar intake from beverages has changed. Finally, as with most
multicomponent interventions, determining which indi-
vidual components may have been more or less responsible
for the observed effects is difficult.
This study also has important strengths. First, the study
applied rigorous methods, including a comparison group with
a nearly identical pattern of beverage sales before the start of
the intervention. Second, although most studies rely on di-
etaryself-reporttoassesssugarydrinkconsumption,thisstudy
is the first, to our knowledge, to use retail sales data to assess
the impact of a complex, community-wide sugary drink cam-
paign. Third, the study has long-term outcome data. Because
sales were tracked for 4 years, evidence suggests that the
changes observed during the first year were sustained over

time. Furthermore, the demographic data and supermarket
share data in both communities remained consistent during
the 4 years, ruling out the concern that the findings are due
to demographic shifts in population or purchasing behavior.

efficientpoliciestopursue.Futureresearchindemographically

curdisproportionatelyamonghighersocioeconomicgroups,with
important implications for health equity.33
These study results should not dissuade policy makers
from adopting additional policies to amplify decreases in con-
sumption of sugary drinks. A recent study from Berkeley, Cali-
fornia, suggests that sugary drink consumption decreased by
21% after the enactment of an excise tax.34 Other policies that
warrant consideration include the addition of warning labels
on sugary drinks35,36 and a requirement that restaurants of-
fer healthy default beverages with children’
s meals.37 Future
work should address the power of exposure to media cover-
age of a controversial sugary drink policy campaign, because
that may constitute an intervention that educates the com-
munity and focuses attention on the harm associated with sug-
ary drinks.
Conclusions
This study provides the strongest evidence to date that a com-
munity-based campaign can produce meaningful changes in
retail sales of soda and other beverages. This study highlights
the importance of local organizations and government work-
ing together to create strong policies to promote consump-
tion of healthy drinks in our communities.

Editor's Note
Decreasing the Sale of Sugary Beverages
How Sweet It Is
Mitchell H. Katz, MD
The consumption of sugary beverages is a serious problem in
the United States that is associated with obesity, diabetes, and
cardiovascular disease.
Therefore, the success that
Howard County had in de-
creasing the sales of sugary
beverages—through a broad-based community intervention
that included media, community engagement, and policy
changes—is gratifying.1

Public health campaigns can never be evaluated with the
precision of laboratory experiments. However, these authors
demonstrate the value of a well-performed evaluation of an
important public health intervention. Other communities
should implement similar programs.
