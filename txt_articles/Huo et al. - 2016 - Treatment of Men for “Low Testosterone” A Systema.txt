Abstract
Testosterone products are recommended by some prescribers in response to a diagnosis
or presumption of “low testosterone” (low-T) for cardiovascular health, sexual function,
muscle weakness or wasting, mood and behavior, and cognition. We performed a system-
atic review of 156 eligible randomized controlled trials in which testosterone was compared
to placebo for one or more of these conditions. We included studies in bibliographic data-
bases between January 1, 1950 and April 9, 2016, and excluded studies involving body-
building, contraceptive effectiveness, or treatment of any condition in women or children.
Studies with multiple relevant endpoints were included in all relevant tables. Testosterone
supplementation did not show consistent benefit for cardiovascular risk, sexual function,
mood and behavior, or cognition. Studies that examined clinical cardiovascular endpoints
have not favored testosterone therapy over placebo. Testosterone is ineffective in treating
erectile dysfunction and controlled trials did not show a consistent effect on libido. Testos-
terone supplementation consistently increased muscle strength but did not have beneficial
effects on physical function. Most studies on mood-related endpoints found no beneficial
effect of testosterone treatment on personality, psychological well-being, or mood. The pre-
scription of testosterone supplementation for low-T for cardiovascular health, sexual func-
tion, physical function, mood, or cognitive function is without support from randomized
clinical trials.
1. Introduction
Testosterone and methyltestosterone are marketed in the United States for men with congeni-
tal or acquired hypogonadism. Some practitioners have used testosterone preparations to treat
a variety of symptoms identified as those of “low testosterone” (low-T), a term that has not
been uniformly defined. We present a systematic review of randomized controlled trials
(RCTs) that evaluated the use of testosterone therapy against placebo or inactive comparator in
adult men for cardiovascular health, sexual function, muscle weakness/wasting,mood and

 behavior, or cognition. We did not include studies of testosterone in men with missing or dam-
aged testicles, or who had Klinefelter syndrome or other genetic anomalies. We did not include
studies on the use of testosterone for any indication in women or in children, the use of andro-

2. Methods
2.1 Data Search, Synthesis and Analysis
Computerized literature searches were conducted in PubMed, Embase, and APA PsycNET.
Searches were limited to human males but were not restricted by language or date. The
PubMed search was conducted using the MeSH term “testosterone” and the modifiers “admin-
istration and dosage,” “adverse effects,” “deficiency,” “standards,” “therapeutic use,” or “ther-
apy.” The original PubMed search was conducted for studies published between January 1,
1950 and November 26, 2013. The Embase search was conducted using the Emtree key term
“testosterone,” modifiedby “adverse drug reaction,” “androgen deficiency,” “therapy,” “drug
dose,” or “clinical trial.” The original Embase search was conducted for studies published
between January 1, 1974 and November 26, 2013. The PsycNET search was conducted using
the term “testosterone” modifiedby “addiction,” “drug dependency,” “therapy,” “treatment,”
or “deficiency.” The original PsycNET search was conducted for studies published between
January 1, 1806 and November 26, 2013. All searches were repeated on April 9, 2016 to identify
clinical trials that had been published since the initial search, so the final search included more
than four decades of trials from all databases.
2.2 Study Selection
Search results were combined using EndNote and duplicates were deleted. These results were
filtered using the key term “clinical trial.” Titles and abstracts were reviewed to identify RCTs
and eliminate irrelevant studies. Relevant studies were retrieved.
2.3 Data Extraction
Data were extracted into tables by 4 independent reviewers according to the presence of infor-
mation on cardiovascular health, sexual function, muscle weakness/wasting,mood and behav-
ior, or cognition. Studies with multiple relevant endpoints were included in all relevant tables.
Review articles were identified and retrieved, and their reference lists were searched for pri-
mary publications of RCTs.
Some studies that included randomized controlled designs also included open-label contin-
uation phases. We evaluated and summarized the randomized controlled portions of these
studies. Although our primary interest was the use of testosterone for the treatment of hypogo-
nadism, however defined by study authors, we included trials of testosterone in eugonadal
men. In some studies, eugonadal subjects were randomized to receive testosterone or a com-
parator (usually placebo), and hypogonadal subjects were treated with testosterone only. We
evaluated and summarized only the randomized portions of these studies.
2.4 Quality Assessment
We assessed quality of studies by a 5-point Jadad score. In order to be as inclusive as possible,
we included all studies identified regardless of Jadad score. For clinical endpoints only (angina/
ischemia, congestive heart failure, and erectile dysfunction) we also included an analysis of
studies restricted to Jadad scores of 4 or 5. We accepted whatever criteria were used by individ-
ual study authors to define low testosterone.

 3. Results
Fig 1 lists the exclusion criteria used to select 226 qualifying papers from 11,417 reviewed
abstracts. Although most studies were describedby their authors as randomized, not all indicated
the nature of the randomization procedures. Some studies included identical numbers of subjects
in treatment and exposed conditions, suggesting that allocation was not random. After further
examination, 70 papers did not meet our criteria, so the final data set included 156 papers.

 3.1 Cardiovascular Health
Table 1 summarizes extracted studies that focused on the effect of testosterone on cardiovascu-
lar endpoints, including 17 studies on ischemia/angina, 6 on congestive heart failure (CHF), 25
on lipids, and 11 on inflammatory and coagulation markers.
3.1.1 Coronary artery disease. In studies that investigated the effect of testosterone on
patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), eligible men generally were identified based on
stable angina, angiographic evidence of some degree of coronary artery occlusion, or a history
of myocardial infarction (MI). Six studies involved men in whom the study authors reported
evidence of hypogonadism either clinically [1] or based on plasma testosterone concentration
[2–6]; the remainder included men without regard to plasma testosterone concentration. All
but three of the studies evaluated ST-segment depression on an exercise stress test using a
modification of the Bruce protocol. One of the studies not using the Bruce protocol evaluated
findings on electrocardiography (ECG) and Holter monitoring, without specification of an
exercise protocol.[7] Another study added single-photon emission computer tomography
(SPECT) to evaluate for deficits in myocardial uptake of a labeled perfusion tracer.[8] One
study used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) estimates of myocardial perfusion.[3] One
study evaluated change in coronary artery calcium score over time, showing no difference
between testosterone and placebo.[6]
Two studies evaluated brachial artery response to release of occlusion as an indicator of sen-
sitivity to local vasodilators in men with CAD and did not directly address the coronary arter-
ies; both reported results favorable to testosterone therapy.[9, 10] Two studies in apparently
healthy men with bioavailable testosterone <4.44 nM (128 ng/dL) or total testosterone �15
nM (432 ng/dL) found no change in brachial artery reactivity in response to transdermal tes-
tosterone or dihydrotestosterone therapy.[5, 11] The study that used MRI showed no effect of
8 weeks of oral testosterone undecanoate therapy on myocardial perfusion, although there was
increased perfusion of those segments supplied by an unobstructedcoronary artery.[3]
Three studies used acute treatments with intravenous (IV) testosterone just prior to exercise
testing. Two of the studies showed favorable effects of treatment on time to ST-segment
depression.[2, 12] One study showed no effect on ECG or SPECT evidence of ischemia.[8] A
year-long study showed benefits of testosterone treatment on ST-segment depression.[4] The
remaining eight studies evaluated treatments of 2 to 24 weeks in duration.[1, 3, 10, 11, 13–17]
The 3 studies that looked at time to ST-segment depression found a benefit of testosterone sup-
plementation.[1, 14, 16]
Although 2 studies reported improvements in angina symptoms during or after testosterone
treatment,[7, 15] 4 studies showed no effect of treatment on angina.[1, 4, 8, 16] Most studies
did not report any measure of angina symptoms. A study on men with leg claudication or tro-
phic ulcers attributed to arteriosclerosis did not show an improvement in subjective symptoms,
walking, or plethysmographic estimation of blood flow endpoints after 3 months of testoster-
one therapy.[13]
There was a decreased incidence of silent MI with testosterone treatment in 1 study.[15]
Another study, designed to determine the effect of testosterone supplementation on lower-
extremity strength and physical function in men 65 years of age and older, was stopped early
by a Data and Safety Monitoring Board due to an excess of cardiovascular adverse events.[17]
These adverse events included acute coronary syndrome (ACS), MI, ECG abnormalities, and
arrhythmias, among others.
Eleven studies of coronary artery disease scored 4 or 5 on the Jadad scale. Of these, only one
of five studies that included angina as an outcome found a benefit. Four of five studies that
assessed ST segment depression found a benefit.

 3.1.2 Congestive heart failure. Six studies evaluated effects of testosterone treatment on
CHF.[18–23] In two papers from the same group,[19, 20] it is not clear whether treatments
were randomly assigned. Administration of testosterone by the buccal route was associated
with beneficialeffects on cardiac index and systemic vascular index in the acute catheterization
setting, consistent with an acute vasodilatory effect.[19] Intramuscular (IM) testosterone treat-
ment for 12 weeks improved exercise capacity and reduced heart failure symptom scores with-
out identifiable effects on left ventricular size or ejection fraction (EF).[20] Another study of
IM testosterone in men with CHF showed an improvement in oxygen consumption, respira-
tory efficiency(ventilation/carbon dioxide consumption), and distance walked in 10 minutes
without changes in EF or left ventricular end-diastolic diameter.[18] The improvements in
exercise function appeared attributable to the response of men with baseline plasma testoster-
one concentration <12 ng/mL (~4 nM). A study of a testosterone patch showed improvement
in the shuttle walk test.[23] Another study showed no effect of IM testosterone enanthate on
ejection fraction, although there was an improvement in a Doppler-based myocardial perfor-
mance index.[22]
The only study that scored above a 3 on Jadad found a benefit on CHF measures.[18]
3.1.3 Lipids. Serum or plasma concentrations of cholesterol fractions, triglycerides,and
lipoproteins have been used as surrogate endpoints for cardiovascular risk, although they
should not be mistaken for markers of cardiovascular adverse events. In 25 studies, testosterone
treatment was associated with favorable, unfavorable, or no effects on lipids as summarized in
Table 1. Favorable effects in 11 studies included 5–11% decreases in total cholesterol concen-
tration and variable and inconsistent decreases in triglycerides and low-density lipoprotein
(LDL) cholesterol. One of the studies counted as showing a favorable effect did not demon-
strate a change in total or high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol or triglycerides but
reported a 13% reduction in LDL cholesterol.[24] This finding was based on averages of several
repeated measurements over the course of 1 year rather than a determination of improved
lipid measurements at the end of the treatment period.
Unfavorable changes were reported in 2 studies [5, 25] and included increases in total cho-
lesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglyceridesand decreases in HDL cholesterol in men evaluated
as hypogonadal prior to androgen therapy. Most of the studies that did not report favorable
effects of testosterone on lipids reported no effects at all. One of these studies[26] reported a
decrease in lipoprotein-a (LP-a), but this finding was transient and occurredin a study with
multiple measurements at multiple time points in multiple patient subgroups without adjust-
ment for multiple comparisons. Nine of the 11 studies that had favorable effects on lipids had
Jadad scores of 4 or 5. Nine of the 14 studies that lacked favorable effects on lipids had Jadad
scores of 4 or 5.

 The discordance between studies on the lipid effects of testosterone treatment did not
appear to be route dependent. Seven of the 11 studies showing favorable effects used IM injec-
tion of testosterone enanthate, esters, or undecanoate. Five of the 14 studies not showing favor-
able effects on lipids used IM injection of testosterone esters, cypionate, or undecanoate.
3.1.4 Inflammatoryor coagulation markers. Eleven studies were identified in which
markers that have been associated with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk were mea-
sured in men using testosterone or dihydrotestosterone therapy. Three studies reported favor-
able effects of testosterone on tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), a marker of inflammation.[1,
3, 27] One study in men with CHF showed no effect of testosterone treatment by buccal, IM,
or transdermal routes on serum concentration of TNF-α.[21] One of the studies asserted that
there was a decrease in the inflammatory marker interleukin-1β (IL-1β), but a statistically sig-
nificant effect was not shown.[1] Another study showed a decrease in interleukin-6 (IL-6) and
C-reactive protein, additional inflammatory markers.[28] Two studies performed in elderly
men who were largely without a diagnosis of CAD showed no beneficialeffect of testosterone
therapy on C-reactive protein[29, 30] as did two studies of men with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
[31, 32] Transdermal dihydrotestosterone did not affect inflammatory markers in men with
low total pretreatment testosterone concentrations.[33] No change in fibrinogen, plasminogen
activator inhibitor-1, or tissue plasminogen activator was shown in men with CAD who used
testosterone patches or oral doses.[3, 34]
3.2 Sexual Function
The 48 studies that assessed sexual function or libido as a primary or secondary endpoint are
summarized in Table 2. Study populations included men identified by study authors as “hypo-
gonadal,” normal men, and men with erectile dysfunction (ED). Studies included men with
depression,[35–37] chronic renal disease,[38] cirrhosis,[39] arterial insufficiency,[40] cancer,
[24] diabetes,[26] HIV,[35, 41] Alzheimer disease,[42] and chronic obstructive pulmonary dis-
ease (COPD).[43] Preparations included IM (n = 16), oral (n = 11), topical gel or solution
(n = 14), patch (n = 5), and buccal (n = 1) formulations. Studies used a variety of question-
naires, including the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF), Frenken sexual experience
scales, Derogatis Sexual Performance Scale (DSPS), the Aging Males’ Symptoms (AMS) scale,
Male Sexual Health Questionnaire, Psychosexual Daily Questionnaire, and study-specific ques-
tionnaires. Study reports used different language for symptoms, so we grouped, for example,
“libido,” “sexual interest,” and “sexual desire.”
Of 47 studies that assessed sexual function or satisfaction, 23 studies reported beneficial
effects of testosterone treatment for at least 1 measure of sexual function or satisfaction,[6, 26,
35, 37, 40, 43–60] and 24 studies did not show testosterone-associated improvements in any
sexual function endpoint.[24, 36, 38, 39, 41, 42, 61–78] Three studies we counted as positive
were mixed: Steidle et al found improvement with 100 but not 40 mg of gel, Legros et al[57]
tested 3 dose levels of orally administered testosterone undecanoate (60 mg, 160 mg, and 240
mg) and found a benefit only for the middle dose, and Hackett et al[58] found that testosterone
worked in a group with testosterone �8.0 nM for intercourse satisfaction but not in a group
with testosterone 8.1–12 nM. One study “reported a subjective feeling of increased muscular
energy and sexual desire in some subjects”
.[79] There was no difference between groups by
Fischer exact test (performed by us) and we excluded this study from further analysis. Limiting
analysis to the 30 studies with Jadad scores of 4 or 5 yielded similar results; 14 were positive
and 16 negative.
Of 31 studies that evaluated erectile function, 15 found no improvement with testosterone
therapy,[6, 26, 39, 41, 55, 59, 62, 64, 65, 68, 70–72, 76, 77] and 16 reported a benefit.

 [35, 37, 43–52, 56, 58, 60] Although the study by Chiang et al[50] reported a benefit of both tes-
tosterone and placebo compared to baseline; however, our analysis did not show a difference
between treatment groups. Limiting analysis to the 17 studies with Jadad scores of 4 or 5
yielded similar results; 9 were positive and 8 were negative.
Twelve studies included men with ED; 8 found no benefit of testosterone over placebo,[55,
59, 62, 64, 68, 72, 74, 76] and 4 found a benefit.[35, 46, 47, 49] One negative study found that
testosterone reduced erectile function when compared to placebo; however, there was no
change when each group was compared to its baseline.[76]
Of 23 studies that specificallyreported changes in libido, 13 found that testosterone treat-
ment increased libido,[26, 35, 37, 45, 46, 54, 56, 60, 63, 65, 70, 77, 79] eight found no effect,[24,
38, 39, 47, 59, 67, 75, 76] and 1 found an effect after 3 but not 6 months of treatment.[48] Hack-
ett et al[58] found that testosterone improved sexual desire in a group with initial testosterone
�8.0 nM but not in a group with initial testosterone 8.1–12 nM.
Eleven studies used the Aging Males’ Symptoms scale, which includes 3 questions on libido
and sexual function. Five studies found no difference between testosterone and placebo on
total scores,[26, 54, 57, 72, 76] and 4 studies found a benefit of testosterone.[52, 57, 58, 66]
One paper[53] reported only sexual subscales but not total AMS scores. On the sexual sub-
scale of the AMS scale, this study reported a benefit, Ho et al[73] found no benefit, and Legros
et al[57] found a benefit of testosterone on the AMS sexual subscale only in the middle (160
mg) of 3 dose levels at 3 of 4 time points. Hackett et al[58] found that testosterone improved
AMS scores in a group with initial testosterone �8.0 nM but not in a group with initial testos-
terone 8.1–12 nM.

3.3 Muscle Weakness/Wasting
Table 3 summarizes 39 studies that evaluated the effect of testosterone on physical function,
muscle strength, or HIV-associated muscle wasting, including 19 in men assessed as having
low serum testosterone, 9 on HIV-negative men with normal serum testosterone, 1 on healthy
men with normal serum testosterone, and 10 on HIV-positive men. Studies that measured tes-
tosterone effects only on body composition (other than in HIV-associated wasting) without
measures of physical function or muscle strength were excluded. Subjects included both those
defined by the authors as hypogonadal and those considered to have normal testosterone con-
centrations. Common measures of muscle strength included grip strength dynamometry and
the 1-repetition maximum for exercises including the bench press and leg press. Physical func-
tion was often measured by the 6-minute walk test, the time and number of steps required to
walk 25 feet, and the get-up-and-go test, which evaluates the ability to rise from a chair, walk a
short distance, and return to sitting.
Twenty studies evaluated subjects describedas hypogonadal, with 11 of those evaluating
healthy subjects. Five studies examined the effects of testosterone supplementation on physical
frailty, functional limitations, or a categorization as “sedentary,”[53, 80–83] and single studies
evaluated subjects with COPD,[84] advanced cancer,[75] and Parkinson’s disease.[85] Ten
studies evaluated subjects considered to have normal testosterone concentrations; 1 study
included healthy, elderly men, and the remainder included subjects with planned knee replace-
ment surgery,[86] stable CHF,[18, 22, 87] leg claudication or ulcers,[13] long-term glucocorti-
coid therapy,[88] myotonic dystrophy,[89] arterial insufficiency,[40] COPD,[43] or who were
planning or undergoing physical rehabilitation.[90]
Ten studies evaluated subjects with HIV; 8 of those studies included subjects with HIV-
wasting, 1 included subjects with abdominal obesity, and 1 did not use weight criteria. Most of
these papers studied older men. Few studies investigated the use of testosterone supplementa-
tion in men younger than 60 years.
Twenty-seven studies measured the effects of testosterone treatment on muscle mass, with
22 (81%) of these studies showing a significant increase in muscle mass associated with treat-
ment.[41, 43, 53, 80–84, 88, 89, 91–102] Nineteen of 22 (86.3%) of these studies had a Jadad
score of 4 or 5. Twenty-five studies assessed the effects of testosterone treatment on fat mass,
with 15 (60%) of these studies showing a decrease in fat mass associated with treatment.[11, 43,
53, 81, 83, 84, 88, 91, 93, 94, 96, 97, 99, 102, 103] Twelve of these studies had a Jadad score of 4
or 5.
Some studies did not measure muscle and fat mass specificallybut used other body compo-
sition endpoints. Two studies showed no changes in body weight or BMI,[22, 104] but another
showed an increase in body weight and BMI.[18] One study, with a Jadad score of 3, showed
no change in weight or estimates of body fat (triceps and scapula skinfold thickness).[105] In
studies of HIV-positive men with weight loss, 3 of 6 studies (all of which had Jadad scores of 4
or 5) showed an increase in weight with testosterone treatment,[99, 101, 106] and all 4 studies
that measured muscle mass showed an increase.[41, 99–101]
Of the 30 studies that assessed muscle strength as a primary or secondary endpoint, 13 stud-
ies (43%) reported an improvement in at least 1 measure of muscle strength.[11, 18, 53, 81, 83,
84, 88, 93, 94, 101, 102, 104, 107] Eleven of 13 of these studies had a Jadad score of 4 or 5.
Three of these 12 studies (all with Jadad scores of 4 or 5) reported improvements in fewer than
25% of the measurements.[11, 53, 81] In studies of men without HIV, 11 of 24 studies (45.8%)

 reported an improvement in at least 1 measure of muscle strength. In studies of men with HIV,
2[101, 107] of 5 studies reported an improvement in at least 1 measure of muscle strength; 3
showed no effect.[41, 99, 103]
Twenty-four studies evaluated the effects of testosterone treatment on physical function
endpoints and, of these, 5 found an improvement in at least 1 measure of function.[18, 22, 81,
83, 86] Neither of the 2 studies of HIV patients measuring physical function showed an
improvement in function.[41,100] Six of these studies had a Jadad score of 4 or 5.[18, 41, 81,
83, 86, 100]
In summary, the majority of studies show increased muscle mass but no effect of testoster-
one on muscle strength or function.
3.4 Mood and Behavior
Forty-five studies evaluating the effect of testosterone on mood and behavior are summarized
in Table 4. Twenty-nine of these studies focused on men without psychiatric disorders, and 16
on men with psychiatric disorders.
3.4.1 Healthy men. Some studies of mood and behavior were designed to evaluate the
potential adverse effects of anabolic steroid abuse. For example, men abusing anabolic steroids
have been describedas having “Roid Rage.” We did not evaluate steroid abuse studies, but we
reviewed studies on testosterone preparations and their association with anger, aggression, and
other mood alterations. There was little consistency among the studies we reviewed.
Five studies reported treatment-associated increases in anger, aggression, or hostility.[67,
108–111] Only two of these studies had a Jadad score of 4 or 5.[108, 111] One study,[110] with
a Jadad score of 3, determined that testosterone gel applied to the skin increased hostility based
on evaluations by 2 undergraduate judges of a free-text paragraph written by each subject to
describe his mood at the end of treatment. We do not know the reliability of this assessment.
Two studies (Jadad score 3 and 5) reported a decrease in anxiety after testosterone treatment.
[45, 112]
Seventeen of 29 studies reported no effect of testosterone treatment on personality, psycho-
logical well-being, or mood.[22, 24, 38, 59, 63, 85, 104, 113–121] Seven of 17 studies had a
Jadad score of 4 or 5. One of these studies could not be evaluated because only a composite
score for mood and sexual function was reported.[38] The study that used hostility assessments
by undergraduate judges found no change in personality as assessed by the Gough and Heil-
brun Adjective Check List.[110] Another study in this group reported that elevation of testos-
terone serum concentrations above normal using testosterone gel was associated with an
increase in selfishness on a computer game that evaluated the willingness to give away small

 amounts of money.[122] Two additional studies from the same group in non-depressed men
with CHF did not show an effect of testosterone on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI),[20,
27] although the earlier of these studies concluded otherwisebased on a finding that was not
statistically significant. A study in non-depressed men with metabolic syndrome reported an
improvement in the BDI in testosterone-treated compared to placebo-treated subjects.[52] A
study found non-depressed men older than 60 years to have a mean 5% decrease in a geriatric
depression scale when administered testosterone.[102] This study had a Jadad score of 1.
Another study [58] found that testosterone treatment had no effect on the Hospital Anxiety
Depression score (HADS) in men with testosterone �8.0 nM but improved the depression sub-
set of the HADS in men with testosterone of 8.1–12 nM. Malkin et al.[1] found that 100 mg tes-
tosterone every 2 weeks improved the BDI score. This study had a Jadad score of 5.
3.4.2 Men with psychiatric diagnoses. Twelve studies (3 in HIV-positive men) evaluated
testosterone supplementation in men with a diagnosis of depression or dysthymia (sometimes
also called, “minor depression”), 1 study evaluated the use of testosterone in men with schizo-
phrenia, and 2 studies were conducted in men with Alzheimer disease or cognitive impairment.
The study in schizophrenic men used testosterone or placebo gel in addition to whatever treat-
ment the subject was already using.[123] There were improvements in the negative symptom
scores on a standardized scale but no change in the Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophre-
nia. The authors used an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis and implied that better results were
seen among subjects who completed the study; however, there were no significant differences
in the depression scores between testosterone and placebo among completers. Two studies in
men with cognitive impairment or Alzheimer disease (Jadad score 3) found no effect of treat-
ment on neuropsychiatric symptoms, depression, behavior, or quality of life (QoL).[42, 124]
Caregiver-assessed QoL was improved in 1 of these studies.[42]
The response of depression and dysthymia to testosterone was mixed and inconsistent.
Among HIV-negative men, four studies (all with a Jadad score of 4 or 5) showed testosterone-
associated improvements in standard scoring systems for depression and/or in the proportion
of subjects who achieved remission of their psychiatric disorder.[37, 51, 125, 126] Four other
studies (2 with a Jadad score of 4 or 5) showed no improvement in depression or dysthymia
with testosterone compared to placebo.[36, 111, 127, 128] One study (Jadad score 4) showed a
transient improvement in depression and melancholia after 3 months of treatment that was no
longer apparent after 6 months of treatment.[48]
Because it has been noted that HIV-positive men can be depressed and “hypogonadal,” 3
studies administered testosterone to HIV-positive men with depression or dysthymia.[35, 129,
130] Two of the studies had a Jadad score of 4[35, 130] and one study had a Jadad score of 3.
[129] Testosterone treatment had inconsistent effects on measures of depression; one study
showed a 5.8-point improvement in the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) in men with HIV-
associated wasting, although the improvement may have been explained by an increase in
weight.[129] Another study showed a testosterone-associated improvement in HIV-positive
men overall in the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale but not among subjects with a
depression diagnosis.[35] This study also showed improvement in the total and vegetative
symptom scores of the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) but not in the affective
scale, and there was no significant change in BDI scores. A subsequent, larger study by the
same group showed no difference in response of depression measured by HAM-D or BDI in
men given testosterone compared to placebo.[130]
Authors attributed the mixed responses in the literature to the considerable placebo
response in most studies and to the possibility of an idiosyncratic response to testosterone,
with putative subgroups of responders who were difficultto identify a priori.[111, 127] The
studies, however, did not show consistent responses in subgroups of men who had low serum

 testosterone concentrations, depression resistant to standard therapy, or men characterized as
middle-aged or elderly. In studies in which serum testosterone concentrations were measured
on therapy (both with a Jadad score of 5), response of depression or dysthymia was not consis-
tently associated with serum hormone concentration.
3.5 Cognition
Twenty-two studies evaluating the effects of testosterone on cognition are summarized in
Table 5. Seventeen focused on men without cognitive impairment and 4 focused on men with
cognitive impairment.
3.5.1 Men describedas normal. Ten studies evaluated the effects of testosterone treatment
on cognitive endpoints in healthy men. Spatial cognition/memorywas reported to be improved
with testosterone supplementation in 3 studies,[114, 131, 132] unchanged in 2 studies,[42, 133]
and poorer with supplementation in 1 study.[134] Although 1 study reported improved working
memory[135] and 1 study found improved verbal fluency,[134] most other studies found no
improvement in verbal fluency, memory, or other cognitive endpoints in healthy men given tes-
tosterone.[42, 91, 120, 131, 133, 134, 136] Two of 5 studies that showed improvement and 4 of 7
of the studies that showed no improvement had a Jadad score of 4 or 5.
3.5.2 men describedas hypogonadal. Hypogonadal men, variously defined, were found
in 1 study to have better verbal learning and reversal of digits on number sequencing with tes-
tosterone supplementation,[112] but no effect on the same domain was found in another
study.[137] The study showing an advantage used injected testosterone enanthate 200 mg
while the negative study used a daily 5 mg patch. Another injection study found no effect of
supplementation on memory in hypogonadal men.[104] One study reported a possible disad-
vantage of treatment with dihydrotestosterone compared to placebo in performance on the
Modified Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE),[11] but data were not shown and the puta-
tive difference could not be evaluated. Another study showed no improvement in visuospatial
cognition or MMSE with testosterone treatment for 12 months.[119] All studies had Jadad
scores of 4 or 5.
3.5.3 Men with cognitive impairment. Treatment of men with suspected or diagnosed
Alzheimer disease or cognitive impairment was reported in five studies, two of which had a
Jadad score above 3. Although 1 injection study found an improvement on the Alzheimer Dis-
ease Assessment Scale-CognitiveSubscale (ADAS-COG),[138] another study using testoster-
one gel found no effect on the same instrument or on other cognitive function tests.[42] Spatial
and verbal memory were improved after 6 weekly injections of testosterone enanthate in 1
study, but the effect did not persist during a 6-week washout period without treatment.[132] A
fourth study found no effect of testosterone injections on behavior, activities of daily living
(ADLs), or cognition.[124] The fifth study found that transdermal testosterone gel was not
associated with statistically significant changes in measures of cognition, mood, or quality of
life.[139]
3.5.4 Proposed explanations for inconsistent results. Because study results have been
varied and inconsistent, some authors have proposed that testosterone is not the only factor or
even the most important factor in cognitive function. Janowsky et al[114] found improved spa-
tial cognition in men treated with scrotal testosterone patches, but there was an imbalance
between placebo and testosterone groups in baseline blood concentrations of 17β-estradiol,
which these authors attributed to chance. The effect of testosterone and 17β-estradiol on spatial
cognition testing was explored using post-hoc testing, and the putative testosterone effect on
spatial cognition appeared to be associated with suppression of 17β-estradiol by testosterone
supplementation rather than a direct effect of testosterone. This study had a Jadad score of 3.

 Most authors with an interest in 17β-estradiol have suggested that the effectiveness of tes-
tosterone, when it has shown effectiveness, is due to aromatization to 17β-estradiol. Cherrier
et al[131] measured testosterone and 17β-estradiol concentrations after injection of testoster-
one supplements in healthy men and reported that both testosterone and 17β-estradiol concen-
trations were associated with recall of a test story, but only 17β-estradiol concentrations were
associated with performance on the Stroop test. In another study, Cherrier et al reported that
only men with an increase in 17β-estradiol concentration after testosterone supplementation
showed improvements in verbal memory testing.[136] This study used administration of the
aromatase inhibitor anastrozole to differentiate between effects attributable to testosterone and
those that might be due to 17β-estradiol. Another study without anastrozole found 17β-estra-
diol serum concentrations after testosterone therapy to be a significant predictor of perfor-
mance on verbal memory testing.[140] All three studies had a Jadad score of 5.
It has also been suggested that testosterone supplementation has produced inconsistent results
in cognitive function studies because the blood concentrations achieved by supplementation
need to be in an optimum range for effectiveness.Under this hypothesis, over-supplementation
is as ineffectiveas under-supplementation. Cherrieret al[140] administered testosterone
enanthate IM at 0, 50, 100, or 300 mg weekly and administered tests of verbal and spatial mem-
ory. Results were not reported according to treatment group; rather, subjects were divided into
those with no, moderate, or large increases in serum testosterone concentrations over baseline.
These response categories were defined based on 1 standard deviation above the control response
and 1 standard deviation above the response to 100 mg. Subjects with a moderate increase in
serum testosterone concentration over baseline (defined as 11–50 nM) performed better on cog-
nitive testing than those with “no increase” (0–10 nM) or a large increase (>51 nM). Seventeen
of the 22 men in this moderate-increasegroup had received testosterone 100 mg/week with the
balance evenly divided between the 50 mg and 300 mg doses. The authors explained that they
did not use tertiles or quartiles, because using quartiles or tertiles resulted in some placebo
patients with significant changes from baseline, raising the question of whether men on placebo
with an increase in their serum testosterone concentration were distinguishable on cognitive test-
ing from men who received testosterone supplementation. This study had a Jadad score of 5.
In summary, there is no support for the use of testosterone to enhance cognition in normal
or cognitively impaired men.

 4. Discussion
This systematic review examined published RCTs of testosterone supplementation for cardio-
vascular disease or surrogates of cardiovascular disease, sexual function, muscle strength,
mood, and cognition. The review was limited to published studies in English and to trials
indexed before April 9, 2016. The evidence supporting the use of testosterone for preventing or
treating cardiovascular disease is inconsistent and, on balance, unconvincing. Some evidence
supported an acute and chronic effect of testosterone therapy on increasing time to ST-segment
depression, and there is evidence of improvement in some measures of congestive heart failure.
Most studies showed no effect of testosterone therapy on inflammatory markers, and the effects
on lipids were inconsistent.
Studies that examined clinical effects have not favored testosterone therapy over placebo.
Two of 3 studies that assessed angina showed no effect. Three studies from the same group
found a benefit for symptoms associated with CHF. One study was stopped early for cardiovas-
cular adverse effects.
Testosterone supplementation did not demonstrate consistent effectiveness for improving
sexual function or satisfaction. Testosterone is ineffective in treating ED. Controlled trials were
mixed on libido, with more positive than negative studies.
Substantial evidence supports a favorable effect of testosterone treatment on muscle mass in
both healthy men and men with HIV, and a majority of studies showed a decrease in fat mass.
Testosterone did not affect most measures of muscle strength. While decreasing frailty and
increasing strength in older men might be beneficial,testosterone supplementation does not
improve physical function in older men.
Most studies on mood-related endpoints found no beneficial effect of testosterone treat-
ment on personality, psychological well-being, or mood. Although 2 studies showed
decreased anxiety, treatment of depression showed mixed and inconsistent results. Even if
testosterone did benefit mood, social adverse events might ensue; 5 studies noted treatment-
related increases in anger, aggression, or hostility. Testosterone did not benefit cognitive
impairment or Alzheimer disease; neither did it benefit verbal fluency, memory, or other cog-
nitive endpoints in normal men.
In summary, evidence from RCTs does not support treatment of so-called low-T for
improving physical function, sexual function, mood, or cognition. Testosterone increases mus-
cle mass, but not strength, and while some improvement is seen in some surrogate markers of
cardiovascular risk, there is little evidence of clinical benefit.
There is conflicting evidence on the association between testosterone supplementation and
cardiovascular events. RCTs have reported increased cardiovascular risk with testosterone
therapy. One such trial that specificallyexamined cardiovascular disease and mortality end-
points was stopped early because of an increased risk of cardiovascular events.[17] A meta-
analysis of 2994 men in 27 randomized controlled trials through 2012 found that testosterone
therapy increased the risk of cardiovascular events (OR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.09–2.18).[141]
Observationalstudies examining the effect of testosterone treatment have shown conflicting
results on risk. A Veterans Administration study evaluated men who had undergone coronary
angiography and had a total testosterone concentration (presumably plasma) less than 300 ng/
dL (10.4 nM).[142] Men who were treated with testosterone had an increased risk of all-cause
mortality, MI, and stroke compared to men who did not use testosterone (HR, 1.29; 95% CI,
1.05–1.58), based on a mean of 27.5 months of follow-up. Another retrospective cohort study
using Veterans Administration data showed a lower rate of all-cause mortality, myocardial
infarction, and stroke among testosterone-treated men whose testosterone concentrations
“normalized” after treatment.[143] Another observationalstudy of men in a large, integrated

 health care organization found that death rates were reduced over 3 years, but there was no
effect on myocardial infarction or stroke.[144]
A Medicare-based study identified testosterone exposures and MI outcomes using claims
data and matched testosterone-treated with untreated subjects using an empirically derived
propensity score and found no increased risk.[145] The adjusted HR for testosterone therapy
and MI was 0.84 (95% CI 0.69–1.02). Analysis of subjects in the highest quartile propensity
score range suggested a protective effect of testosterone treatment, with a HR of 0.69 (95% CI
0.53–0.92). An observationalstudy in men with low testosterone found that treatment was
associated with reduced mortality;[146]another in diabetics[147] reported benefit on all-cause
mortality but excluded men who had received testosterone for less than one year and excluded
deaths occurringbefore six months. A large cohort study found that myocardial infarction
rates were significantly increased within three months of testosterone treatment initiation; tes-
tosterone-treated men over 65 experienceddouble the rate of myocardial infarctions compared
to men who did not received testosterone.[148]
Testosterone treatment has been considered for disease prevention because men who are
obese, diabetic, hypertensive, or chronically ill have lower plasma concentrations of testoster-
one.[149] However, the direction of causality is unclear; it is possible that obesity or lack of
exercise and chronic disease lower testosterone rather than low testosterone concentrations
causing disease. It is also possible that another mechanism both lowers testosterone concentra-
tions and increases the risk of some diseases. Observationalstudies attributing positive health
effects to testosterone may be affected by an increased likelihoodof healthier men being pre-
scribed testosterone rather than testosterone improving health.
There are parallels between the recommendation of testosterone and of menopausal hor-
mone therapy in women. Physicians prescribed estrogen and estrogen-progestin preparations
to menopausal women to prevent cardiovascular disease because observationalstudies showed
that women who took menopausal hormones had less heart disease than women who did not.
RCTs, however, showed that menopausal hormone therapy increased the risk of heart attacks
and stroke.[150–153] It is likely that healthier women chose to take menopausal hormone ther-
apy, but menopausal hormone administration did not improve health.
In 2012, sales for testosterone therapies exceeded $2 billion, and sales continue to grow in
dozens of countries.[154] To the extent that this increase in use of testosterone supplementation
is based on anticipated improvements in cardiovascular health, sexual function, physical func-
tioning, mood, or cognition, we suggest that it might represent therapy without adequate clinical
trial support. We identified no population of normal men for whom the benefits of testosterone
use outweigh its risk. Given the known risks of testosterone therapy and the lack of evidence for
clinical benefits in normal men, we do not think further trials of testosterone are necessary.
