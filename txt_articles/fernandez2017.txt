Abstract
Background: Few studies have examined the potentially reduced life
expectancy associated with spinal pain (i.e. low back and neck pain) in
an ageing population, particularly after controlling for familial factors,
including genetics.
Methods: We investigated whether spinal pain increased the rate of all-
cause and disease-specific cardiovascular mortality in older Danish twins
aged ≥70 years. Data from 4391 participants collected at baseline were
linked with the Danish Cause of Death Registry with the study ending
on 31 December 2014. Two crude and adjusted Cox proportional
hazards regression analyses determined the rate of all-cause and disease-
specific
cardiovascular
mortality
by
baseline
spinal
pain
exposure;
unpaired (total sample analysis) and twin pair (intra-pair analysis).
Analyses
were
also
adjusted
for
confounders;
baseline
physical
functional ability and depressive symptoms. Competing risk regression
models determined the rate of cardiovascular mortality, adjusting for
similar confounders and using the total sample only.
Results: Spinal pain was associated with an increased rate of all-cause
mortality, hazard ratio (HR): 1.13 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.06–1.21].
There was no association between spinal pain and cardiovascular disease
mortality, sub-distribution hazard ratio (SHR): 1.08 [95% CI 0.96–1.21]. After
adjusting for confounders (physical functional ability and depressive symptoms),
the association became non-significant. All intra-pair analyses were statistically
non-significant, although greater in magnitude for monozygotic twins.
Conclusions: Older people reporting spinal pain have 13% increased
risk of mortality per years lived but the connection is not causal. We
found no association between spinal pain and cardiovascular-specific
mortality. The influence of shared familial factors is unlikely.
Significance: Older people reporting spinal pain have 13% increased
risk of mortality per year lived. However, this association is not likely to
be
causal,
with
the
relevant
confounders
contributing
to
this
relationship. Thus, pain in the spine may be part of a pattern of poor
health, which increases mortality risk in the older population.

 1. Introduction
Low back pain (LBP) and neck pain (NP) are leading
causes of morbidity (C^
ot�
e et al., 2001), with LBP
regarded as the highest contributor to years lived
with a disability globally (Vos et al., 2015). In the
adult population, the annual prevalence of LBP
ranges from 22% to 65% (Walker, 2000) with sever-
ity increasing over time (Hicks et al., 2008). Ranked
fourth in the Global Burden of disease study, NP has
an annual prevalence almost as high as LBP (17–
75%) with also increase in severity with age (Fejer
et al., 2006). Approximately, one-third of patients
who report LBP also have NP concurrently, com-
monly described as spinal pain (Nyman et al., 2007).
Furthermore, spinal pain can extend to seniors with
the prevalence ranging from 7% to 49% (Jacobs
et al., 2006) and the impact on daily life also
increasing with age.
Although the burden of spinal pain as a muscu-
loskeletal condition is firmly established (Haldeman
et al., 2012), little is known as to whether spinal
pain potentially reduces life expectancy. With an
ageing population, this is relevant as it is well estab-
lished that chronic (Torrance et al., 2010) wide-
spread (McBeth et al., 2009), musculoskeletal pain
(Jordan and Croft, 2010) and degenerative joint dis-
ease such as osteoarthritis (N€
uesch et al., 2011)
increase the rate of mortality, yet the relationship
between
spinal
pain
and
all-cause
mortality
is
unclear (Heli€
ovaara et al., 1995; K�
areholt and Brat-
tberg, 1998; Zhu et al., 2007; Jordan and Croft,
2010; Docking et al., 2015). For instance, older
adults aged ≥70 years reporting LBP appeared to be
at risk of increased mortality (Zhu et al., 2007; Dock-
ing et al., 2015), while there was more uncertainty
in cohorts that included both young and old adults,
with one study showing an impact on longevity due
to LBP and NP (Jordan and Croft, 2010), whereas
other studies showed no effect (Heli€
ovaara et al.,
1995; K�
areholt and Brattberg, 1998). Apart from all-
cause mortality, the conflictive relationship with
spinal pain extends to cardiovascular mortality, the
number one cause of death globally (Smith et al.,
2012).
A
number
of
studies
have
shown
an
increased mortality risk associated with cardiovascu-
lar diseases in people with a history of LBP (Pentti-
nen, 1994), regional and widespread pain (McBeth
et al., 2009), while other studies have not found a
relationship
(Heli€
ovaara
et al.,
1995;
Penttinen,
1995).
With a rising life expectancy and/or declining birth
rates, the ageing population is expected to markedly
rise, potentially increasing the risk of both functional
decline and a loss of independence in the aged. With
spinal pain the leading cause of disability globally
(Vos et al., 2015), the personal, community and
societal consequences are likely to be significant. We
accessed data from a large population-based study of
older Danish twins, to determine whether older peo-
ple with spinal pain are subjected to an increased
rate of all-cause and cardiovascular-related death.
We also nested a co-twin intra-pair design, control-
ling for familial factors, including genetics, providing
potential insights into causal relationships.
2. Methods
2.1 Study population
The Danish Twin Registry forms the basis of this
study (Kyvik et al., 1995), which accessed a large
population-based prospective cohort of Danish twins
aged 70–102 years, described elsewhere in detail
(Christensen et al., 1999). Briefly, trained assessors
conducted face-to-face health and lifestyle-related
self-reported interviews with all participants, taking
approximately 60–75 min to complete (McGue and
Christensen, 1997). In 1995, data were collected for
participants aged 75 years or older. In 1997, intact
Danish twin pairs aged 73 years or older were
invited to participate, and in 1999 and 2001, twins
aged 70+ years were included. Eligible twins were
invited to participate, regardless of whether the
co-twin was alive (Christensen et al., 1999).
Monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs
were identified via answers to questions relating to
similar and mistaken identity – a method validated
by genetic testing with an accuracy of 95% (Peeters
et al., 1998). The utilization of twins through an
intra-pair design provides a unique opportunity, as
they are either partially (DZ) or fully (MZ) matched
on genetic makeup and early childhood environ-
ment. Participants must have self-reported no prior
history of coronary heart disease including myocar-
dial infarction to be eligible. Mortality data from the
Cause of Death Registry were linked to the Twin
Registry (Juel and Helweg-Larsen, 1999). Partici-
pants were followed from the date of study entry
until death, or end of study period, 31 December
2014 – which ever occurred first. The present study
was approved by the Regional Scientific Ethical
Committees for Southern Denmark (VF20040241)
and the Danish Data Protection Agency (2007-54-
0227).

 2.2 Spinal pain
The exposure investigated was participants’ report of
1-month prevalence of spinal pain, i.e. LBP and/or
NP. With LBP and NP likely part of a general muscu-
loskeletal pain syndrome (Hartvigsen et al., 2009),
both exposures were merged for this study. Based on
the health and lifestyle survey, participants at base-
line were asked; ‘during the past month, have you
suffered from LBP, acute LBP or lumbago?’ Simi-
larly, NP was assessed with the question ‘have you
during the past month suffered from pain or stiffness
in the neck?’ If participants answered ‘yes’ to either
question, they were considered to have spinal pain.
2.3 Mortality
The outcome of interest was all-cause mortality and
mortality due to coronary heart diseases including
myocardial infarction. The causes of death were
coded according to the World Health Organization
eighth and tenth international classification of dis-
eases (ICD-8 and ICD-10). Specific codes: 410–414
(ICD-8)
and
I20–I25
(ICD-10)
defined
coronary
heart diseases.
2.4 Potential confounders
We investigated physical functional abilities, depres-
sive symptoms, the presence of hypertension, smok-
ing habits and physical activity levels as potential
confounders of significance at baseline. Self-reported
physical functional ability was assessed during the
interview – a valid, reliable method of discriminating
levels of functional ability in the aged and also
reported high internal consistency (.93) (Jette et al.,
2002). All 11 items in the questionnaire were based
on what the individual was able to do or complete
on the day of the interview, including walking
around in the house, walking up and down stairs –
one floor and to the second floor, getting outdoors,
walking 400 m without a rest, engaging in light and
hard exercise, walking in both nice and bad weather
for 30–60 min, running 100 m and carrying 5 kg. A
scale ranging from 1 to 4 rated all items (Christensen
et al., 2000), with higher scores indicating poor
physical function.
Depressive symptoms were assessed as a continu-
ous variable with an adapted version of the Cam-
bridge
Mental
Disorders
of
Elderly
Examination
(CAMDEX) (Roth et al., 1986). An additional 11
items were added to the 21 depression-related items
from the CAMDEX, which displayed high internal
consistency (.83) (McGue and Christensen, 1997).
Items were rated on a 1- to 3-point scale or 1- to
2-point scale and averaged into a total score, with a
higher score indicating higher levels of depressive
symptoms.
Smoking was dichotomised as ‘current or previous
smoker’ and ‘non-smoker’. Regarding the presence
of hypertension, participants were asked whether a
doctor had ever told them that they suffered from
hypertension. Participants who answered ‘yes, previ-
ously’ or ‘yes, currently’ were asked to confirm the
diagnosis was made by a doctor. Hypertension was
dichotomised as ‘hypertensive’ and ‘not hyperten-
sive’.
Physical activity levels were assessed by asking
participants whether they were engaged in light
physical activity, e.g. light gardening, easy gymnas-
tics, short duration walks or bike rides. If participant
answered ‘yes’, they were asked the regularity of
such
activities,
with
potential
answers
including
‘almost every day,’ ‘several times per week,’ ‘about
once a week,’ ‘2–3 times per month’ and ‘about
once a month.’ Participants were then asked if they
were engaged in heavy (strenuous) physical activity,
e.g. heavy gardening, long duration walks or bike
rides, sports or dancing. If participants answered
‘yes,’ they were asked to specify the frequency of
these activities. Engagement in physical activity was
separated into ‘heavy physical activity’ and included
participants who reported ‘yes’ to heavy physical
activity and ‘yes’ to light physical activity. Partici-
pants who only answered ‘yes’ to ‘light physical
activity’
were
included
along
with
those
who
answered ‘no’ to ‘no physical activity’ or ‘irrelevant’.
2.5 Statistical analysis
Descriptive statistics were used to describe the data
using the mean and confidence intervals for vari-
ables with normal distribution and median (range)
for variables with a skewed distribution.
Twins were initially treated as individuals with a
cluster term included, taking into account the inter-
dependence of observations within twin pairs. Age
was used as the underlying time scale as twins
entered the study at different ages. Follow-up in per-
son years was determined from age at study com-
mencement
until
either
age
of
death
or
31
December 2014 – whichever occurred first. For all-
cause mortality, we performed an unpaired analysis
using all twins, then intra-pair using only the same-
sex DZ (ssDZ) and MZ twins. Only the unpaired
analysis was performed for the risk of cardiovascular
death analyses.

M. Fernandez et al.
Spinal pain and increased mortality
 For the total sample (unpaired) analysis, Kaplan–
Meier survival curves depicted the rate of all-cause
mortality by spinal pain exposure. Cumulative inci-
dence curves determined the rate of dying from car-
diovascular disease (or other causes) by spinal pain
exposure for the unpaired analysis.
The rate of all-cause mortality by spinal pain
exposure was determined by univariate Cox propor-
tional hazard regression, which partially corrects for
dropouts by censoring patients at the last available
follow-up assessment. We further explored if the
beta estimate changed by more than 10% (Roth-
man
et al.,
2008)
by
adding
all
potential
con-
founders
to
the
univariate
model.
Only
those
confounders found to be greater than 10% were
retained. Similar steps were performed for the rate
of cardiovascular death, using Fine and Gray sub-
distribution hazard regression competing risk models
(Fine and Gray, 1999).
Multi-collinearity of the variables was assessed by
examining the individual variance inflation factors
(VIF) (VIF > 10) and the mean VIF (VIF > 4) of the
model.
When
multi-collinearity
existed,
separate
models were fitted for each confounder and the
models with the lower Akaike (AIC) and Bayesian
(BIC) information criterion were reported.
The models were checked for the proportionality
hazards assumption by fitting the models with time-
varying covariates of the variables. The models fit
were verified by constructing plots of the scaled
Schoenfeld residuals. On visual inspection, variables
that were determined to be non-proportional were
either stratified (for categorical) or the time scale of
age was divided into discrete periods and hazard rate
ratios were calculated for each period (for continu-
ous). Outliers were assessed by plotting the deviance
residuals of the final models.
Because differences between ssDZ and MZ twins
can be used to estimate the confounding effect from
shared familial factors, the unpaired analysis was
compared to the intra-pair analysis. To control for
genetic and background factors shared by a twin
pair, intra-pair analyses were performed by stratifica-
tion on twin pairs. Assuming an effect of spinal pain
on all-cause mortality in the unpaired analysis,
shared familial confounding could be indicated if the
intra-pair analysis showed a reduction in the mea-
sured estimate in ssDZ and MZ twins. Should the
association persist, it may be consistent with a causal
path and not shared familial confounding. Statistical
analyses were performed using STATA, release 13,
statistical software; StataCorp LP, College Station,
TX, USA.
3. Results
3.1 Sample characteristics
From the original cohort of 4731 twins, a total of
4391 participants with a follow-up of 40,442 person
years were included in this study (Fig. 1). The mean
follow-up time was 9.2 years and interquartile range
was 4.4–14.0 years. The mean age at baseline was
77.8 years and 1557 (35.5%) twins reported spinal
pain, 732 participants were alive and 3659 had died
during the follow-up period. Those who had passed
away were older (78.8 vs. 72.9 years), had poorer
physical functional ability and likely to have suffered
depressive symptoms. Baseline spinal pain preva-
lence was higher for those who passed away (36.3%
vs. 31.2%) and they were less likely to engage in
heavy physical activity, many not engaging in physi-
cal activity at all. They were also likely to be current
or past smokers, but less likely to be hypertensive.
Those who were alive were more likely to engage in
heavy physical activity (61.8% vs. 30.2) (Table 1).
Cardiovascular
disease-specific
mortality
data
showed that 732 participants were alive and 1219
had died at follow-up from a myocardial infarction.
The mean age was 77.8 years and 1557 (35.5%)
reported spinal pain. Those who had died from coro-
nary heart disease were older (79.7 vs. 72.9 years),
had poor physical functional ability and likely to
have
suffered
depressive
symptoms.
Spinal
pain
prevalence was again higher among those who had
died (36.9% vs. 31.2%) and were less likely to
engage in heavy physical activity (similar to all-cause
mortality, many were not engaged in physical activ-
ity at all). Participants who died were also more
likely to be current or past smokers and be hyper-
tensive. Those who were alive were more likely to
engage in heavy physical activity (61.8% vs. 27.6%)
(Table 1). Finally, study characteristics showed that
approximately 60% of the population who had died
from all-cause and cardiovascular-specific mortality
were women, reflecting the larger proportion of
women than men in the study sample.
3.2 All-cause mortality
Kaplan–Meier survival curves show all-cause mortal-
ity for participants with and without spinal pain,
respectively
(Fig. 2).
Unadjusted
Cox
regression
analysis in the unpaired analysis, showed a statisti-
cally significant increased risk of mortality (HR) of:
1.13 (95% CI: 1.06–1.21). After adjusting for depres-
sive symptoms, there was a reduction in the rela-
tionship
(HR = 1.03,
95%
CI:
0.96–1.11).

M. Fernandez et al.
Spinal pain and increased mortality
 unadjusted intra-pair analysis (ssDZ and MZ com-
bined) for all twins showed a statistically non-signifi-
cant association (HR = 1.14, 95% CI: 0.94–1.40).
When the analysis was split on zygosity, the associa-
tion, although not statistically significant, persisted
in
ssDZ
(HR = 1.13,
95%
CI:
0.87–1.46)
and
increased in the MZ (HR = 1.20, 95% CI: 0.86–1.68)
twins.
After
adjusting
for
depressive
symptoms,
physical functional ability and smoking, the intra-
pair analysis for all twins showed a statistically non-
significant association (HR = 1.12, 95% CI: 0.91–
1.39). When the analysis was split on zygosity, the
association, although not statistically significant, per-
sisted in ssDZ (HR = 1.09, 95% CI: 0.82–1.44) and
increased in the MZ (HR = 1.17, 95% CI: 0.83–1.66)
twins (Table 2).
3.3 Cardiovascular-specific mortality
Cumulative incidence curves show disease-specific
mortality in patients with and without spinal pain
for myocardial infarction along with other causes
(Fig. 3). We did not find a statistically significantly
elevated mortality risk between spinal pain and car-
diovascular mortality (SHR) = 1.08 (95% CI: 0.96–
1.21) for all twins. After adjusting for depressive
symptoms, the borderline association between spinal
pain
and
cardiovascular
mortality
remained
(SHR = 1.03, 95% CI: 0.90–1.17). When adjusted for
depressive symptoms, sex and smoking, spinal pain
results
were
somewhat
comparable
when
ssDZ
(SHR = 1.10, 95% CI: 0.93–1.29) and MZ twins
(SHR = 0.93, 95% CI: 0.73–1.18) were analysed sep-
arately. Intra-pair analyses were restricted to all-
cause mortality only (Table 3).
4. Discussion
Older people reporting spinal pain during the past
month after the age of 70 have a 13% yearly
increased risk of death; however, the link is not cau-
sal, with the association attenuating and becoming
non-significant when adjusted for baseline physical
functional
ability
and
depressive
symptoms.

Spinal pain and increased mortality
M. Fernandez et al.
 cardiovascular-specific mortality. Our results further
suggest that the effect of spinal pain on all-cause mor-
tality is not overly influenced by genetic and early-
shared environmental (familial) factors. Thus, spinal
pain in the aged is an indicator of poor health and
poor functional ability, which increases mortality risk.
Our results are in agreement with a recent study
(Docking et al., 2015), which found a borderline sig-
nificance between disabling back pain and mortality,
with a HR: 1.30 (95% CI: 0.99–1.70) after adjusting
for health-related variables in a cohort (n = 1174)
with a mean age of 83 years. In another study of
older women (Zhu et al., 2007), with a mean age of
75 years, the authors found a significant association
between ‘daily back pain’ (HR: 1.93, 1.08–3.43) but
not for ‘frequent back pain’ (HR: 1.24, 0.68–2.26)
and mortality, after adjusting for cardiovascular dis-
ease
risk
factors
and
physical
activity
levels.

Spinal pain and increased mortality
 Although age is strong predictor of death, and spinal
pain (in our study) is a significant health problem in
participants who were in their late 70s, it is plausible
that the impact of spinal pain on excess mortality in
younger, working age populations could be different,
as these populations generally experience less influ-
ence of comorbidities. However, our findings are by
and large consistent with previous literature, which
also shows excess mortality in working age popula-
tions for LBP and NP (Jordan and Croft, 2010),
regional and wide spread pain (McBeth et al., 2009),
and chronic pain (Torrance et al., 2010).
We implemented a co-twin intra-pair design, but
could not provide new evidence that the spinal pain
and all-cause mortality association could be traced
back to shared early life environment and genetic
makeup. The long-term reach of the family-rearing
environment could affect future adult health, i.e.
low childhood education attainment increases the
risk of coronary heart disease and mortality (Gilman
and Loucks, 2012). In addition, given the heritability
estimates of LBP (21–67%) (Ferreira et al., 2013),
NP (24–58%) (Nielsen et al., 2012) and longevity
(20–30%) (Skytthe et al., 2003), the possibility of
genetic confounding cannot be completely ignored,
although the estimates of our MZ intra-pair analyses
showed a slight increase in magnitude, suggesting
that independent factors, rather than shared familial
confounding played a role in influencing the rela-
tionship between spinal pain and mortality. In effect,
our study findings are consistent with the literature,
which shows that the influence of genetics in spinal
pain decreases with age, and is almost non-existing
in the older age (Hartvigsen et al., 2004), with the
contribution of non-shared (independent) environ-
mental factors increasing as people get older (Hest-
baek et al., 2004).
We also found no association between spinal pain
and an increased rate of cardiovascular mortality,
which was consistent with all but one study (Pentti-
nen,
1994)
in
the
previous
literature
that
also
found no statistical relationship with non-specific
back pain and myocardial infarction (Heli€
ovaara
et al., 1995; Penttinen, 1995). This included regio-
nal and widespread pain (McBeth et al., 2009),
although these studies generally did not include
older populations, aged >70 years. In order to pro-
vide a more accurate estimate of cardiovascular-
specific mortality, as opposed to previous studies,
our inclusion criterion required participants to have
self-reported no prior history of coronary heart dis-
ease, including myocardial infarction in order to be
eligible. In doing so, participants were identified
and followed at the same time point for the course
of the disease, as an inception cohort. This elimi-
nates participants with prior or established ‘pre-clin-
ical’
coronary
heart
disease
at
baseline,
thus
minimizing study bias and reducing the likelihood
of overestimating the morality rate.
While direct causal links between spinal pain and
mortality are unlikely, pain can lead to increased
smoking (Ditre and Brandon, 2008), reduced social
participation (Steptoe et al., 2013) and symptoms of
anxiety or depression (Outcalt et al., 2015). Pain can
also reduce physical activity participation, and it is
plausible that this might encourage or promote an
increase in bodyweight or obesity (Ray et al., 2011).
This in turn increases the risk of a number of
chronic conditions, including diabetes, which is an
indicator for cardiovascular disease and subsequent
mortality risk (Wilson et al., 2002). In our study,
older people who were still alive at the end of the
study, were more likely to have engage in heavy
physical activity, i.e. heavy gardening, long duration
walks or bike rides, sports or dancing at baseline,
compared to those who had died (62% vs. 30%),
highlighting the importance for remaining active.
Notably, our unadjusted analysis reported a signifi-
cant relationship for all-cause mortality, which was
attenuated when adjusted for functional ability or
depressive symptoms. This attenuation appears logi-
cal and could be a down-stream of spinal pain, as
pain could induce reduced functional ability and/or
enhance depressive symptoms, increasing the risk of
mortality. Hence, these variables are likely acting as
intermediary or mediating factors, and in determin-
ing the nature of the association, potential mecha-
nisms
or
pathways
between
spinal
pain
and
mortality should be explored (Baron and Kenny,
1986). However, these variables can also be consid-
ered as confounders to both spinal pain and mortal-
ity, as inactive people tend to lose functional ability
(Karttunen et al., 2012), i.e. loss of muscle mass,
aerobic capacity and the likely exposure to spinal
pain and earlier death. Similarly, those with depres-
sive symptoms may promote fear avoidance beliefs
(Leeuw et al., 2007) and immobility, increasing the
likelihood of spinal pain and mortality. Given our
unadjusted mortality findings were reduced due to
markers of poor health in older spinal pain patients,
the contribution of these confounders might repre-
sent
important
aspects
of
the
health
status
of
patients with spinal pain. Thus, from a clinical or
preventative
perspective,
confounders
should
be
more thoroughly considered and screened during a
health practitioner/patient encounter. This alertness

M. Fernandez et al.
 can assist in identifying patients at higher risk of pre-
mature death.
Strengths of the present study include a longitu-
dinal
design
and
a
large
population-based
twin
cohort used without restrictions. As interviews were
home
based,
participation
rates
were
high
and
there was a long follow-up, allowing a large num-
ber of events to be observed. Our outcome of mor-
tality was obtained through the Cause of Death
Registry, and the instruments used to measure our
confounders have excellent psychometric properties
(McGue and Christensen, 1997; Jette et al., 2002).
The Danish twin sample can be considered repre-
sentative of the general singleton Danish popula-
tion,
reporting
the
same
prevalence
of
general
adult-related
diseases
and
mortality
patterns
(V�
ager€
o
and
Leon,
1994).
Finally,
the
co-twin
intra-pair design accounts for previously unmea-
sured shared familial factors in spinal pain and
mortality studies. Limitations include potential lack
of transferability to other cultures, along with most
baseline variables being self-reported and not per-
formance based, which is often not feasible in large
population-based studies such as ours. However,
this can be advantageous as questions regarding
spinal pain were nested within a general health
survey and not specifically singled out as the pri-
mary aim of the interview. By not favouring spinal
pain, possible bias could be avoided. The 1-month
prevalence of spinal pain was assessed at baseline
only, thus a change in pain status is unknown, i.e.
whether it was a transient or ongoing problem.
Additionally, our registry-based research did not
allow the differentiation between those with severe
and/or chronic spinal pain from those with spinal
pain that was mild and/or not chronic. Given the
under-representation of older people in the litera-
ture, objective reliable measures were generally not
available for spinal pain in the aged. However, the
health survey was not self-administered but con-
ducted by trained personnel by way of interview,
thereby providing a relatively robust measure for
spinal pain in those 70 years of age or older. In
spite of these limitations, the presence of spinal
pain is a strong predictor for spinal pain at follow-
up, with LBP and NP reportedly continuing into
old age (Hartvigsen et al., 2003). While our study
was limited to spinal pain, the relationship with
mortality could also be attributable to widespread
pain (which includes the axial skeleton) or chronic
pain, with the latter recently found to be modestly
associated with increased mortality (Smith et al.,
2014).
Finally,
residual
confounders,
including
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory, statin medication
use, and social economic status were not explored.
While the co-twin intra-pair method is a power-
ful approach in determining the contribution of
shared
familial
factors,
there
were
fewer
cases
reported in the intra-pair analysis, as not all twin
pairs participated in the survey – possibly yielding
imprecise estimates. However, our confidence inter-
vals
were
not
overly
wide
and
the
intra-pair
approach has previously shown independent effects
consistent with a causal path in other twin studies
(Carlsson et al., 2007; Sadler et al., 2011), confirm-
ing its value when these effects are present. Non-
shared factors may have also influenced the intra-
pair
analysis,
i.e.
confounding
could
take
place
within the twin pair. Such an effect could be pre-
sent if the association between spinal pain and
mortality persisted in the intra-pair analyses, with
non-shared factors possibly explaining the small,
but increasing estimate that was observed in our
intra-pair analyses, despite being a non-significant
finding. This assumption is based on our small,
increasing magnitude, plausibility of associations as
well as confidence intervals, rather than exclusively
on p-values (Nuzzo, 2014).
5. Conclusion
Older people reporting spinal pain have a 13%
increased risk of mortality per year lived but the
connection is not causal. The relationship disappears
when controlling for relevant confounders, suggest-
ing that spinal pain is part of a pattern of poor
health, which increases mortality risk. We found no
association between spinal pain and cardiovascular-
specific mortality, while the influence of shared
familial factors is unlikely. With a rapidly growing
ageing population, spinal health is critical in main-
taining older age independence, thus highlighting
the importance of spinal pain to primary care as a
presenting symptom.
