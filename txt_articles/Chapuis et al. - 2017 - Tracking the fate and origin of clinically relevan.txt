Abstract
Adoptively transferred tumor-specific cells can mediate tumor regression in cancers refractory to 
conventional therapy. Autologous polyclonal tumor-specific cytotoxic T cells (CTL) generated 
from peripheral blood and infused into patients with metastatic melanoma show enhanced 
persistence, compared to equivalent numbers of more extensively expanded monoclonal CTL, and 
are associated with complete remissions (CR) in select patients. We applied high-throughput T cell 
receptor Vβ sequencing (HTTCS) to identify individual clonotypes within CTL products, track 
them in vivo post-infusion and then deduce the pre-adoptive transfer (endogenous) frequencies of 
cells ultimately responsible for tumor regression. The summed in vivo post-transfer frequencies of 
the top 25 HTTCS-defined clonotypes originally detected in the infused CTL population were 
comparable to enumeration by binding of antigen peptide-HLA multimers, revealing quantitative 
HTTCS is a reliable, multimer-independent alternative. Surprisingly, the polyclonal CTL products 
were composed predominantly of clonotypes that were of very low frequency (VLF) in the

 endogenous samples, often below the limit of HTTCS detection (0.001%). In patients who 
achieved durable CRs, the composition of transferred CTLs was dominated (57–90%) by cells 
derived from a single VLF clonotype. Thus, HTTCS now reveals that tumor-specific CTL enabling 
long-term tumor control originate from endogenous VLF populations that exhibit proliferative/
survival advantages. Along with results indicating that naïve cell populations are most likely to 
contain cells that exist at VLF within the repertoire, our results provide a strong rationale for 
favoring T cells arising from VLF populations and with early-differentiation phenotypes when 
selecting subset populations for adoptive transfer.
Introduction
Adoptive transfer of tumor-specific cytotoxic T cells (CTL), a strategy demonstrating the 
capacity for eliminating cancer in an increasing number of settings, requires the in vivo 
establishment of a robust, persistent population of tumor-specific cells to prevent tumor 
recurrences (1, 2). Our group has utilized the endogenous autologous T cell repertoire of 
patients as a readily accessible source of antigen-specific cells. In this approach, bulk 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) are repetitively stimulated by dendritic cells 
pulsed with specific HLA-restricted peptides from tumor antigens to increase the frequency 
of antigen-specific T cells. In our initial efforts, the responding cells were cloned by limiting 
dilution and CTL infusion products represented one expanded clone/cell (3–8). This strategy 
facilitated tracking by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based approaches, 
using primers flanking the clonal complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3) (5, 7). 
However, such monoclonal T cell products exhibited only a short survival in vivo (<14 days) 
in the majority of patients, likely reflecting the extensive expansion required to attain 
therapeutic cell doses from a single reactive T cell in vitro, and the associated terminal 
differentiation (3, 9–11).
The availability of high-speed cell sorting based on peptide-MHC (pMHC) binding now 
enables infusion of CTL that stem from a polyclonal tumor-specific repertoire (12). 
Additionally, in both murine and human studies, CD8+ T cell culture conditions that include 
exposure to IL-21 during in vitro priming has been shown to facilitate greater expansion of 
the antigen-responding cells with less apoptosis (13–17). By employing such strategies, 
therapeutic cell doses can be produced by ex vivo expansion in 4–6 weeks rather than 3–4 
months, and the tumor-specific cells generated have a higher replicative capacity and less 
terminally differentiated phenotype in vivo (8, 12, 18). As a likely consequence of such 
technologies, infusion of polyclonal CTL now produces enhanced in vivo persistence (>6 
months) in a larger fraction of patients, which correlates with long-term tumor regression 
and improved disease control in a subset of patients (19, 20).
Ample evidence suggests that the nature of the original parent T cell population is critical in 
determining the in vivo behavior of the expanded infused CTL (10, 17, 21–23). To elucidate 
the factors that might contribute to the persistence of these polyclonal, IL-21 primed CTL 
that lead to clinical responses, we investigated the endogenous frequencies of the infused 
clonotypes that contribute to mediating and sustaining tumor regression. In the case of 
autologous adoptive transfers, expanded/infused polyclonal tumor-specific T cells

 necessarily originate from a patients’ pre-existing circulating T cell repertoire. Following ex 
vivo stimulation and culture, the phenotype and frequency of the expanded CTL are 
generally sufficiently altered such that the qualities of the parent cells cannot be determined 
from the characteristics of the cells at the time of infusion (22). However, the CTL that 
persist express/acquire phenotypic and functional characteristics associated with long-lived 
memory T cells, including markers associated with survival (CD28, CD27 and CD127) (24, 
25), lymph-node homing (CD62L and CCR7) (26, 27), and exhibit the capacity for poly-
functional cytokine production (IFNγ, TNFα and IL-2) (28), suggesting some of these 
characteristics are critical for persistence and tumor control (20).
We therefore utilized high-throughput T cell receptor Vβ sequencing (HTTCS) to sequence 
T cell receptor (TCR) Vβ regions in a massively parallel fashion and thereby assess 
clonotype evolution after infusions, determine the contribution of distinct cells and 
investigate the original source of the cells which progeny most likely made a major 
contribution to mediating tumor regression/control. HTTCS can discern individual TCR 
clonotypes in a polyclonal population with a limit of detection of 1/100,000 (0.001%) (29–
31), and we first assessed whether this could enable in vivo tracking of the potentially 
thousands of infused individual tumor-specific clonotypes. After demonstrating the accuracy 
of this approach, we then applied HTTCS to a set of 10 patients with metastatic melanoma 
who had detectable frequencies of transferred T cells after infusions. All patients had 
received polyclonal IL-21-primed T cell products expanded from unselected circulating T- 
cell populations. We investigated the number of clonotypes that persisted after infusions, 
their individual frequencies and the characteristics of the original source of the cells whose 
progeny most likely made a major contribution to mediating tumor regression/control.
Results
Validation of HTTCS for tracking the frequency of transferred monoclonal CTL in vivo
Among patients (Pts) who received monoclonal (M) T cells in a previous study (on Protocol 
#2140 (7), see Materials and Methods), we analyzed the two (of eleven infused) in whom 
the transferred cells were detectable in vivo for >40 days after infusions (Table 1). Pt 
M2140-1 was infused with cells expanded from a melanoma-specific CD8+ T cell clone: 
99.4% of the cell infusion product bound the HLA A*0201-restricted TCR1127-35 (A2/
MART1) pMHC multimer (Figure 1A). HTTCS revealed one clonotype comprised 99.7% of 
all TCR reads; 29 other clonotypes detected with frequencies ≥0.001% (Table S1) comprised 
the remaining 0.3% and were likely bystander/contaminant clonotypes derived from the 
irradiated allogeneic PBMCs used to expand the cells (Figure 1B, upper pie plot). Pt 
M2140-2 was infused with CD8+ T cells recognizing the HLA B*4402-restricted 
Tyrosinase192-200 epitope (B44/Tyr), for which a pMHC multimer could not be synthesized. 
The cell product included a total of 868 clonotypes of which the most prevalent single 
clonotype represented 94% of all TCR reads (Figure 1B, lower pie plot). For both patients, 
the most prevalent HTTCS-detected clonotype was confirmed as the infused CTL clone by 
TCR Vβ quantitative PCR (Table S2). We then compared the post-transfer in vivo 
frequencies of the most prevalent clonotype in each infusion product, as assessed by 
HTTCS, p-HLA multimer binding and/or TCR Vβ quantitative PCR. For Pt M2140-1,

 frequencies obtained by HTTCS were 42.1%, 0.84% and 0.61% of total TCR reads in 
PBMC collected on days 4, 56 and 508 after transfer. By comparison, the frequencies by 
multimer staining were 40.0%, 0.21% and 0.74%, and 48.5%, 0.57% and 0.28% by TCR 
Vβ-specific PCR (Figure 1C, upper graph). For Pt. M2140-2, HTTCS frequencies were 
21.5%, 6.75% and 1.25% at days 4, 48 and 117, compared to 15.8, 3.0% and 0.71% using 
TCR Vβ-specific PCR (Figure 1C, lower graph). Thus, for frequencies ≥0.001% of total T 
cells, HTTCS frequencies yielded results concordant to TCR Vβ-specific PCR and pMHC 
multimer binding, suggesting HTTCS can be used to quantitatively track the frequency of 
infused monoclonal CD8+ T cells in vivo.
HTTCS accurately tracks the in vivo frequencies of adoptively transferred polyclonal CTL
We next analyzed PBMC from 10 patients who had each received one infusion of 1010/m2 
polyclonal (P) CTL specific for A2/MART1 on a previous study (on Protocol #2225 (20), 
see Materials and Methods) (Table 1). HTTCS detected between 56 and 2036 (mean 
555.4) clonotypes in the polyclonal infusion products from Pts P2225-1-10 (Figure 2A). The 
most prevalent clonotype comprised between 4 and 77% of the total cells in each infusion 
(mean 33.3%), and the 25 most prevalent clonotypes together comprised between 35.0 and 
99.9% (mean 78.4%) of the total cell products. This HTTCS analysis was performed on 
infusion products selected for binding pMHC multimers with >99% purity. The limit of 
pMHC detection is typically ≥0.01% of CD8+ T cells, which is at least 10-fold less sensitive 
than HTTCS. Thus, HTTCS of infusion products that have been selected by pMHC 
multimer-binding is likely to also include contaminant clonotypes. To avoid tracking these 
bystander clonotypes after adoptive transfer, we excluded from analysis those clonotypes 
that had higher frequencies in pre-infusion PBMC compared to their frequencies within the 
CTL products, as these clonotypes likely reflected non-expanded bystander cells that 
decreased in frequency through the cell culture process (Table S3). A total of 86 clonotypes 
(average 0.014% of total CTL products) with frequencies of 0.001% to 8.85% (mean 0.35%) 
were thus identified and removed from our analysis. Tracking the sum of the frequency of all 
infused, expanded clonotypes by HTTCS yielded near concurrent results with those obtained 
by tracking pMHC multimer binding for all pts who received polyclonal products (Figure 
2B). Thus, HTTCS appears to accurately track the in vivo frequencies of infused polyclonal 
CTL.
In vivo specific clonotype frequencies increase as a consequence of adoptive transfer
To affirm that the post-infusion increase in clonotype frequencies is a reproducible 
consequence of the CTL infusions, we assessed the frequency of individual infused 
clonotypes for two patients who each received two polyclonal infusions, 30 or 37 days apart 
(Protocols #2504 and #2558(32), see Materials and Methods) (Table 1). Although the 
clonotypes constituting the largest fraction of the patients’ first and second infusates were 
shared, clonotype frequencies did vary as a likely consequence of the culture process, which 
uses an aliquot of the first CTL culture/infusion to expand sufficient cells for a second 
infusion (Figure 3A). The sum of all shared clonotypes was tracked in PBMC before and 
after each infusion (Figure 3B), as was the individual contribution of the top 25 and all 10 
clonotypes for Pts P2504-1 and P2558-1, respectively (Figure 3C). Before infusions, all 
clonotypes were detected in PBMC with frequencies of <0.01% (max 0.0097, median

 0.001%) and 0.09% (max 0.085%, median 0.0028%) for Pt P2504-1 and P2558-1, 
respectively. The frequency of the clonotypes peaked between 1 and 7 days after the first 
infusion (Pt P2504-1 - max. TCR seq. 2: 1.5%, median for first 25 clonotypes: 0.06%; Pt 
P2558-1 - max. TCR seq. 5: 2.73%, median for all 10 clonotypes: 0.35%), and the 
frequencies decreased over 14 or 30 days to near or at baseline levels. The same clonotypes 
then peaked again 1 to 7 days after the second infusion, albeit at lower frequencies (Pt 
P2504-1- max. TCR seq. 11: 0.64%; median: 0.05%; Pt P2558-1- max. TCR seq. 1: 0.68%; 
median: 0.15%). Thus, the post-infusion changes in clonotype frequency appear to be a 
consequence of the infusion of antigen-specific CTL and not co-incidental variations within 
the endogenous TCR repertoire. Of note for these 2 patients, no correlation could be 
established between the frequency of the clonotypes in the infused product and the peak 
frequencies after infusion.
SingIe, immunodominant persistent clonotypes are associated with CRs after adoptive 
transfer
Of the ten patients with metastatic melanoma who received A2/MART1-specific polyclonal 
CTL, two achieved CRs as evaluated by the immune-related response criteria (IrRC)(33), 
two a partial remission (PR), three stable disease (SD) and three had progressive disease 
(PD) as best response (Table S4 and (19, 20)). The frequencies of the first 25 most prevalent 
clonotypes detected in each cell product were individually tracked in vivo after adoptive 
transfer (Figure 4A, colored lines), as were the sum of remaining clonotypes (Figure 4A, 
grey lines). In the two patients who achieved a CR after infusion (Pt P2225-1, Pt P2225-7), 
only one individual clonotype remained detectable at sustained frequencies higher than those 
of other infused clonotypes (>0.056% at 280 days and 0.093% at 175 days post-infusion for 
Pts. P2225-1 and 7 respectively) and represented the majority (>99%) of detected antigen-
specific cells post-infusion (Figure 4A, red arrows). Clonotype half-lives (t½, see 
Statistical Analysis) were determined for each patient and grouped according to best 
clinical response (Figure 4B). For patients who achieved a CR (Pts P2225-1 and 7), the 
immunodominant clonotypes (Figure 4B, red arrows) had t½ of 173 and 132 days, which 
was respectively ~7 and 5 times longer than the median t½ of all infused clonotypes for Pts 
P2225-1-10 (24.8 days). Along with the higher expression of Ki67 by the transferred pMHC 
multimer-binding cells, - composed by a majority of the dominant clonotype - compared to 
multimer− cells (Table S5 and (7, 20)), these findings indicate the immunodominant CTL 
had the capacity to expand and persist. For the remaining patients, the average t½ of 
clonotypes after transfer was 53 and 31 days for patients who achieved a PR as best response 
(Pts P2225-9 and 10), 44, 46 and 21 days for patients who achieved SD (Pts P2225-2, 4 and 
6), and 13, 15 and 14 days for patients who progressed (Pts P2225-3, 5 and 8). When all 
clonotype t½ were grouped according to patients’ best response (Figure 4C), the t½ 
differences were statistically significant between patients who obtained CRs, PRs, SDs and 
PDs. Thus, prolonged in vivo persistence of transferred clonotypes is associated with, and 
presumably important for, tumor control by transferred CTL.
Pre-existing clonotype frequencies provide insights into the nature of persisting CTL
The number of clonotypes comprising the polyclonal cell products for Pts. P2225-1 to 10 
was between 56 and 2036, with a median of 262.5 clonal sequences (Table S2). However,

 most clonotypes present in cell products (range 43 to 1275, median 160) were detected by 
HTTCS with frequencies below 0.001% (the limit of detection) in PBMC obtained before 
and after infusion, and constituted only a minor fraction of the total infusion product (range 
0.82 – 24.7%, median 2.26%) (Figure 5A, grey areas). As stated before, a clonotype with a 
frequency in the CTL product that was less than its corresponding frequency in the pre-
infusion PBMC was defined as having not expanded during the culture process (Table S2, 
bottom row). These clones comprised a minor fraction of the final infusion product, with a 
median of 0.02% (range 0–0.61%) (Figure 5A, purple areas), and were not further 
monitored. We found that clonotypes detected in any post-infusion PBMC sample, but not 
detected in pre-infusion samples (range 10–205, median 56 sequences), were the dominant 
components of the final cell product (range 74.68–98.97%, median 97.67%) (Figure 5A, 
blue areas), implying preferential expansion from individual parental clonotypes with 
frequencies < 0.001%; i.e. a very low frequency (VLF) population. The immunodominant 
clonotypes in both patients who achieved CRs (Pts P2225-1 and 7, Figure 4A and 4B, red 
arrows) were derived from respective VLF populations. Clonotypes expanded in the cell 
infusion product that were detectable in PBMC before infusion were less prevalent (range 0–
6, median 2 sequences), comprising <10% (range 0–9.22%, median 0.03%) of the final cell 
products that were infused (Figure 5A, orange areas). The frequencies of all expanded 
clonotypes were summed at multiple timepoints after infusion (Figure 5B, solid red circles) 
and further subdivided into previously undetected (Figure 5B, open blue circles) versus 
previously detected clonotypes (Figure 5B orange open circles). Previously undetected 
clonotypes represented the majority of cells in both infusion products and the detected 
clonotypes in post-transfer PBMC, whereas previously detected clonotypes comprised a 
small fraction of infused products and a minority of post-transfer clonotypes.
To assess the likelihood that the preferentially expanded and infused clonotypes originated 
from a distinct parental T cell subpopulation, we assessed the propensity for clonotypes 
present in three sets of normal donor PBMC to exhibit a mostly antigen-experienced or 
naïve phenotype. Overall, clonotypes with frequencies <0.001% in PBMC were 15 times 
more likely (72% ± 2% vs 5% ± 3%) to have originated from a CD3+CD45RA+ (primarily 
naïve T cells, TN) VLF population than from a CD3+CD45RO+ (mostly antigen-experienced 
cells) population (Figure S1).
Discussion
The use of HTTCS to examine TCR clonotypes of defined antigen specificity pre-infusion, 
through in vitro culture and following adoptive transfer has provided a means to monitor the 
accumulation and in vivo persistence of individual clonotypes within a polyclonal 
population. This technology provides concordant results with frequency analyses by qPCR 
of defined TCRs, which has more limited utility but can be used for tracking monoclonal 
cell products, and by pMHC multimer stains, which can be used to track polyclonal as well 
as monoclonal products but doesn’t distinguishing individual clonotypes (5, 7, 20, 34, 35). 
HTTCS essentially provides a ‘natural barcode sequence’ through the specific CDR3 TCR 
sequences of all clonotypes in an infused CTL cell product, enabling the identification of the 
cell/clonotype of origin within pre-infusion donor PBMC, measuring the expansion of each 
individual clonotype in the infusion product, and monitoring their individual in vivo fates

 after infusions (29–31). These results can be correlated with clinical outcomes, which should 
facilitate the development of methods to preferentially isolate/generate cells that will have 
greater therapeutic efficacy.
We were surprised to observe that the vast majority of CTL expanded in the infusion product 
originated from rare T cells. To increase the probability of generating autologous antigen-
specific cells for adoptive transfer, the culture methods used in this study were aimed at 
expanding as many T cells as possible, without regard for a specific substrate T cell subset 
(20). Thus, autologous MART1-specific T cells “competed” with each other in the culture 
system, and certain clonotypes with pre-infusion frequencies <0.001% demonstrated an 
increased fitness and preferentially expanded. These were also the cells that comprised the 
majority of antigen-specific cells that were detectable and persisted post-infusion. Thus, the 
culture system fostered the expansion of fit cells that, despite having the capacity to 
recognize the tumor antigen, had a lower likelihood of already having been expanded in vivo 
in the tumor-bearing patient. By contrast, tumor-specific clonotypes that were more 
abundant in pre-infusion PBMC, with frequencies >0.001%, were generally less numerous 
in the final cell products and persisted less robustly in vivo after infusion, suggesting these 
cells both expanded less well ex vivo and were less fit for survival post-infusion. This latter 
observation is consistent with the poor expansion of tumor-specific cells that have been 
driven to exhaustion by a persistent antigenic burden (36).
It is known that the qualities of the parent T cell from which tumor-specific CTL originate 
before ex vivo expansion plays a critical role in in vivo persistence, survival and 
proliferation after transfer (1, 2). CD8+ T cells can be separated into distinct subsets based 
on phenotypic markers that distinguish cells with different molecular programs and biologic 
functions. These CD8 subsets include TN and antigen-experienced cells, with the latter 
further subdivided into at least memory stem (TSCM) cells central (TCM), effector (TEM), 
and terminal effector (Teff) cells (10, 14, 17, 21, 22, 37, 38). In prevention models, TCM are 
generally superior to TEM, presumably reflecting the distinct ability of TCM to form long-
lasting memory, rapidly proliferate and expand after re-encountering antigen, and produce 
abundant differentiated TEM (10, 21, 22). By contrast, in therapy models of established 
tumors and of chronic infection, transferred cells derived from TN are generally superior to 
TCM, with an enhanced ability to provide sustained proliferation and in vivo expansion 
leading to enhanced persistence and anti-tumor activity. This likely reflects both greater 
replicative potential of TN-derived cells and also that TCM may already be programmed to 
undergo apoptosis or become functionally exhausted if stimulation persists and the Ag is not 
rapidly cleared (17, 23). Within the TN compartment (CD45RA+62L+) the small subset of 
TSCM, distinguished by CD95 expression, appears to retain the plasticity of TN cells and the 
self-renewal capacities of TCM (38), functioned better than TCM in tumor therapy models 
and persisted for years after transfer into humans (39–41).
Although available clinical reagents could not distinguish the origin of cells at the time of 
infusion as expanded CTL derived from TN, TCM or TEM mostly display a differentiated 
TEM phenotype after in vitro expansion (8, 20, 22), our data set does provide insights into 
the likely origin(s) of the most effective cells. First, all cells obtained from the patients were 
stimulated with antigen-pulsed dendritic cells in the presence of IL-21 that facilitates the

 expansion of antigen-specific CTL with low initial endogenous frequencies (15). The effects 
of IL-21 exposure during priming of antigen-specific CD8+ TN have been best characterized 
and shown to help imprint a central memory program following antigen-specific stimulation, 
with limited differentiation of the expanded cells promoting survival, expansion and in vivo 
persistence post-infusion in murine models and human trials (8, 14, 42, 43). However, the 
effect of IL-21 on previously exposed antigen-experienced memory cells during stimulation 
is less clear (43, 44). Our analysis of normal donors suggest that clonotypes with PBMC 
frequencies <0.001% were 15 times more likely to be included in a CD45RA+ subset which 
includes mostly TN but also TSCM, compared to CD54RA− subsets, which include Teff, TEM 
and TCM. These findings are consistent with murine studies where antigen-specific naïve 
precursor frequencies were estimated at ≤1 in 200,000 cells (45), and where the majority of 
naïve CD8 T cells TCRβ sequences were found at very low clonotype frequency (46). 
Together these data support the notion that antigen-naïve T cells are included in VLF 
populations. Although speculative, cells derived from VLF populations in our study might 
have been more likely to originate from a naïve rather than antigen-experienced subset. 
However, this could not be ascertained due to the logistical impossibility of sampling all pre-
infusion cells to obtain their phenotypes (7, 20). It is plausible that some TCM and TSCM 
cells may also be found among the VLF populations, as these early-differentiation 
phenotypes may have experienced limited in vivo expansion (38). However, regardless of 
origin, parent cells whose progeny have the potential to ultimately persist, either assisted by 
IL-21 exposure or due to their intrinsic nature, are clearly rare in the repertoire. By contrast, 
in vivo expanded cells with higher intrinsic frequencies are apparently not suitable substrates 
for achieving sustained responses by T cell infusion.
Our findings also show that within VLF populations, only a minority of CTL are poised to 
produce offspring that can mediate sustained clinical responses. In this series of patients 
with metastatic melanoma, HTTCS tracking of infused clonotypes showed the antigen-
specific response in PBMC of patients who reached CRs was largely dominated by a single 
immunodominant CTL clone, derived from a VLF population, which remained detectable at 
high frequencies over time. Although no pre- or post-tumor biopsies were obtained from 
these patients to assess the presence of these clonotypes at the tumor site, the development 
of vitiligo in Pt P2225-1(19), suggests an ongoing MART1-specific on-target, off-tumor 
effect. Along with the capacity of the immunodominant CTL for sustained proliferation, 
reflected by their Ki67 expression and markedly prolonged t½ (>100 days) in PBMC 
compared to other simultaneously transferred clonotypes, these CTL were likely 
instrumental for tumor elimination either through a direct anti-MART1 effect or by 
facilitating the development of secondary responses (19, 20). For these two patients, only 1 
in 56 (1.8%) and 1 in 76 (1.3%) infused clonotypes persisted and mediated/contributed to 
antitumor responses. These results are reminiscent of the proliferation and expansion of a 
very limited number of T cell clones at the tumor site in patients who presented clinical 
responses to immunomodulatory agents (47).
The application of HTTCS to this clinical trial has provided unique insights by enabling

 survival can be enhanced by antigenic exposure, cells that carry high-affinity TCRs that can 
signal in the context of low-levels of antigen presentation (2, 48, 49), as is the case for most 
“self” tumor-antigens (50), are likely to have a post-infusion survival advantage compared to 
cells that carry low-affinity TCRs (51). Of the ten patients we studied, only two of 4,722 
MART1-specific infused clonotypes (0.04%) demonstrated an immunodominant anti-tumor 
effect. Thus, a better understanding of such TCRs, and the intrinsic cellular properties 
associated with this rare feature, could direct strategies to endow cell therapy products with 
enhanced anti-tumor efficacy. Such TCRs can be identified by HTTCS and are paramount 
candidates for isolation use in adoptive T cell therapies in which TCR genes are transduced 
into optimal T cell subsets for patients with appropriately matched HLA types. This strategy 
might be used to broadly confer anti-tumor efficacy to a wider range of patients with 
metastatic disease.
Materials & Methods
Clinical protocols and patient characteristics
All clinical investigations were conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki 
principles. All clinical protocols were approved by the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research 
Center Institutional Review Board, and the US Food and Drug Administration. All patients 
provided written informed consent.
Treatment Plans (Table 1): Protocol #2140
Pts M-2140-1 and M-2140-2 with metastatic melanoma received cyclophosphamide (CY) 
4000mg/m2 administered over 2 days before the infusion of 1010 monoclonal melanoma-
specific CTL/m2 followed by low-dose subcutaneous (s.c.) IL-2 (250,000 U/m2) twice daily 
for 14 days (NCT 00438984) (7). Pts M1 and M2 received CTL specific for HLA A*0201-
restricted MART1127-35 (AAGIGILTV) and HLA B*4403-restricted Tyrosinase192-200 
(SEIWRDIDF), respectively. We specifically analyzed the 2 of 11 patients who received 
monoclonal products and demonstrated post-infusion in vivo persistence for a direct 
assessment of the equivalence of multimer staining, CDR3 PCR and HTTCS on a unique 
CTL clone. Protocol #2225: Pts P2225-1-P10 with metastatic melanoma received CY 
300mg/m2 before the infusion of 1010 polyclonal A*0201-restricted MART127-35 CTL/m2, 
immediately followed by low-dose s.c. IL-2 and ipilimumab (anti- Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte 
Associated Protein 4, Yervoy®, Bristol Myers Squibb) (52) 3mg/kg every 3 weeks for a total 
of 4 doses (NCT 00871481) (20). Radiologic responses were evaluated post-infusion 
according to the IrRC (Figure S1) (33). Compared to monoclonal products, a higher fraction 
of polyclonal products expressed the markers CD27, CD28 and CD127 associated with 
memory. Whereas 100% (10/10) of polyclonal products persisted, only 18% (2/11) of 
monoclonal products persisted beyond 40 days in vivo (Table 1). Protocol #2504: Single 
patient protocol for a Pt P2504-1 with metastatic breast cancer whose tumor expressed NY-
esophageal antigen 1 (NY-ESO1). The patient received CY 2000mg/m2 administered 3 days 
before infusion of 1010 polyclonal HLA A*0201-restricted NY-ESO1157-165 
(SLLMWITQC) CTL/m2. Thirty days later, the patient received the same cell dose preceded 
by CY 300mg/m2. Protocol #2558: Single patient protocol for Pt P2558-1 with metastatic 
Merkel cell carcinoma whose tumor expressed the Merkel cell polyoma virus (MCPyV)

 (32). The patient received 1010 polyclonal HLA A*2402-restricted MCPyV LT-Ag92-101 
(EWWRSGGFSF) preceded by intralesional IFN-β-1B (3 × 106 IU) to a pancreatic 
metastasis and followed by low-dose s.c. IL-2. Thirty-one days later, the patient received the 
same cell dose, this time preceded by a single 8 gray (Gy) fraction of radiation to a 
remaining metastasis, followed by 14 days of low-dose s.c. IL-2.
Generation and expansion of monoclonal tumor-specific CTL products (without IL-21)
For protocol #2140, which involved monoclonal tumor-specific cells, cell processing was as 
previously described (7). Briefly, PBMCs were collected by leukapheresis and all ensuing ex 
vivo manipulations were performed in the clinical Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) 
Cell Processing Facility of the FHCRC. (12) Donor PBMC were stimulated three times for 
7–10 day cycles with autologous dendritic cells (DC) pulsed with the HLA*0201-restricted 
MART-126-35 (EAAGIGILTV) peptide (Anaspec) at a DC to effector ratio of 1:2–10 to 
obtain sufficient frequencies (>5%) of MART1-reactive CD8+ T cells. On Day 2 of each 
stimulation, the γc-chain cytokines, IL-2 (12.5IU/ml), IL-7 (5ng/ml) and IL-15 (1ng/ml), 
were added. Cultures that contained ≥ 5% specific CD8+ T cells, assessed by multimer 
analysis, were cloned by limiting dilution and then stimulated twice using the Rapid 
Expansion Protocol.(4) CTL products were frozen, thawed and washed before infusion, for a 
total production time of 12–13 weeks.
Generation and expansion of polyclonal tumor-specific CTL products (with IL-21)
For protocols #2225, #2504 and #2586, polyclonal tumor-specific cell products were 
generated as previously described.(12, 20) Briefly, PBMCs were depleted of CD25+ T cells 
(Miltenyi Biotec Inc.) to eliminate regulatory T cells, and stimulated for seven days twice 
with autologous DC pulsed with MART126-35. DC stimulations were supplemented with the 
same γc-chain cytokines plus IL-21 (30 ng/mL) on Day 1. Cultures that contained ≥ 5% 
specific CD8+ T cells were clinical-grade sorted (BD Influx cell sorter, BD Biosciences) and 
stimulated twice using the Rapid Expansion Protocol. The total production time was 6 
weeks.
CTL tracking by peptide-MHC multimers
The sensitivity of multimer staining was fixed at 0.1% of total CD8+ T cells for monoclonal 
products (7), and at 0.05% for polyclonal products(20), as previously described. To compare 
the multimer stain tracking results expressed as a percentage of CD8+ T cells, to HTTCS 
expressed as percentage of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, multimer results are reported as a 
percent of CD4+ and CD8+ cells using the formula: (%Multimer+ CD8+ T cells) × ([% total 
CD8+ T cells in each sample]/([% total CD8+ T cells]+[% total CD4+ T cells])).
CTL tracking by quantitative PCR
Primers flanking the CDR3 region of infused melanoma-specific CTL clones were designed, 
as previously described (5, 7). Total CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were determined by flow 
cytometry and the following formula was used to determine TCR copies per 100 T cells: 
100/([% total CD8+ T cells in each sample]+[% total CD4+ T cells in each sample]*[TCR 
copies/{β-actin copies/2}*100]).

 DNA extraction and immunosequencing
DNA was extracted from CTL products and whole PBMC using Qiagen Maxi DNA 
isolation kits (QIAGEN Inc.). TCRβ CDR3 regions were amplified and 750 ng of extracted 
DNA sequenced by Adaptive Biotechnologies Corp (Seattle, WA) using the “deep” 
resolution ImmunoSEQ assay, as previously described (53). Raw sequence data was filtered 
using the Adaptive bioinformatic website based on the TCRβ V, D and J gene definitions 
provided by the International ImMunoGeneTics collaboration (IMGT) (54), using the IMGT 
database (www.imgt.org). Productive nucleotide sequences were used for all tracking 
experiments. The data was further filtered to exclude sequences with no identifiable V and J 
removing PCR errors such as primer dimer and mispriming, as well as sequences with a raw 
read count <2, removing nucleotide sequencing errors (29).
CTL tracking by HTTCS
Only cells that bound pMHC multimers were selected by flow cytometry before DNA 
isolation for HTTCS. The limit of detection of HTTCS was set at 0.001% of all TCR reads 
below which frequency could not be reliably determined (31). Only clonotypes present in 
the CTL products were tracked in PBMC obtained after infusions. The frequency of each 
clonotype detected by HTTCS is based on all TCR Vβ reads from CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.
Normal Donor Sorts
PBMC were collected from three healthy adult donors, and processed into three populations 
for TCR sequencing: i.e. whole PBMC, flow-sorted CD3+CD45RA+ and CD3+CD45RO+, 
representing the naïve and antigen-experienced T cell populations, respectively. TCRs from 
~1 million cells from each population were sequenced by HTTCS. Clonotypes were tracked 
in the original PBMC samples and considered part of a CD3+CD45RA+ versus an 
CD3+CD45RO+ phenotype if it was observed in one population but not the other, or if its 
abundance was ten-fold greater in one population compared to the other.
Statistical Analysis
Correlation between values obtained by HTTCS, multimer and TCR PCR: The Pearson’s R 
was calculated on the log TCR frequency using frequencies obtained by HTTCS and either 
% multimer+ T cells or TCR copied per 100 cells and treating each biological sample (i.e., 
timepoint) as an independent observation. P values were generated by normal 
approximation. Half-lives of persistent TCR clonotypes were determined using the formula 
t1/2= t/(log2[N0/Nt]). Only clonotypes that had at least 3 consecutive values above the limit 
of detection (0.001%) and for which R2 was >0.3 were used in the analysis. Comparison of 
clonotype t1/2 obtained in patients grouped according to their best clinical response: the 
Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to obtain p values.

individual percent contribution of the most prevalent 25 antigen-specific clonotypes in the 
infused products (left y axis) are shown (colored lines) as well as the sum of the remaining 
sequences in the products (grey lines), before (left-most timepoint) and at selected time-
points after infusions (day 0). Red arrows indicate the immunodominant clonotypes for Pts 
P2225-1 and 7 who achieved a CR (indicated) as best response. (B) Half-lives of clonotypes 
for each Pt grouped according to their best response. Green box: CRs, blue box: PR, purple 
box: SD, red box: PD. Arrows pointing to red circles indicate the immunodominant 
clonotypes for patients P2225-1 and 7. (C) Box and whisker plots of the t½ grouped 
according to patient best responses. *p≤0.05, ***p≤0.0005.

 Figure 5. Persistence/frequency of different clonotype subsets in vivo
(A) Pie plots showing the number (top row) and percentage (bottom row) of clonotypes 
composing the infused polyclonal products. Clonotypes in the infusion products which were 
below the limit of detection either before or at any time-point after infusions (grey area). 
Clonotypes detected at any time-point after infusions which were not detected in PBMC 
before infusions (blue area). The number of clonotypes composing the blue area for each 
patient are shown on the top row and their respective percentage are shown on the bottom 
row. Sum of clonotypes detected in PBMC before infusions expanded in the infusion 
product (orange area). Sum of clonotypes detected in PBMC before not expanded in the 
infusion product (purple area). (B) Percent total antigen-specific TCR sequences (solid red 
circles); percent total TCR sequences detected at any time-point after infusions which were 
not detected in PB before infusions (open blue circles); percent total TCR sequences 
detected in PB before infusions expanded in the infusion product (open orange circles), 
before and at selected timepoints after infusions.
