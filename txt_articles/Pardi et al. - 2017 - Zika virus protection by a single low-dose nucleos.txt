Zika virus (ZIKV) has recently emerged as a pandemic associated 
with severe neuropathology in newborns and adults1. There are 
no ZIKV-specific treatments or preventatives. Therefore, the 
development of a safe and effective vaccine is a high priority. 
Messenger RNA (mRNA) has emerged as a versatile and highly 
effective platform to deliver vaccine antigens and therapeutic 
proteins2,3. Here we demonstrate that a single low-dose intradermal 
immunization with lipid-nanoparticle-encapsulated nucleoside-
modified mRNA (mRNA–LNP) encoding the pre-membrane and 
envelope glycoproteins of a strain from the ZIKV outbreak in 2013 
elicited potent and durable neutralizing antibody responses in mice 
and non-human primates. Immunization with 30 μg of nucleoside-
modified ZIKV mRNA–LNP protected mice against ZIKV 
challenges at 2 weeks or 5 months after vaccination, and a single 
dose of 50 μg was sufficient to protect non-human primates against 
a challenge at 5 weeks after vaccination. These data demonstrate 
that nucleoside-modified mRNA–LNP elicits rapid and durable 
protective immunity and therefore represents a new and promising 
vaccine candidate for the global fight against ZIKV.
ZIKV, first identified in 1947 (ref. 4), is a mosquito-borne and sex-
ually transmitted flavivirus that has recently been associated with 
microcephaly and other birth defects in newborns and Guillain–Barré 
syndrome in adults1. Effective vaccines have been approved for other 
closely related flaviviruses5–7, but vaccine candidates for ZIKV have 
only recently been developed8–12. Multiple vaccine formats have been 
shown to protect mice or non-human primates against ZIKV infec-
tion, including plasmid DNA9–12, purified inactivated virus10,11, protein 
 
subunit8 and adenovirus vectors8,10. The ideal vaccine is safe and 
induces protective immunity after a single immunization, regardless 
of prior serologic history. Of the candidate Zika vaccines described 
to date, only a rhesus adenovirus platform (RhAd52) has been shown 
to confer protection after a single immunization in non-human 
 
primates; however, the efficacy of the RhAd52 vector in humans is 
currently unknown. Additionally, pre-existing immunity to adenovirus 
serotypes can limit the efficacy of such vectors13,14, and low neutralizing 
titres to rhesus adenoviruses, including RhAd52, have been detected 
in humans15.
mRNA has emerged as a promising vaccine modality that can elicit 
potent immune responses (reviewed in refs 2, 3), while avoiding the 
safety risks and anti-vector immunity associated with some live virus 
vaccines (reviewed in ref. 16). Vaccination with mRNA offers several 
advantages over other vaccine platforms: (i) it is a non-integrating, 
non-infectious gene vector that can be readily designed to express any 
protein with high efficiency; (ii) it has the potential for cost-effective 
and highly scalable manufacturing; and (iii) small doses are sufficient 
to induce protective immune responses.
Here, we designed a potent anti-ZIKV vaccine in which the pre- 
membrane and envelope (prM–E) glycoproteins of ZIKV H/PF/2013 
(ref. 17) are encoded by mRNA (Extended Data Fig. 1a)  
containing 
the modified nucleoside 1-methylpseudouridine (m1Ψ), which 
prevents innate immune sensing and increases mRNA translation 
 
in vivo18. Nucleoside-modified ZIKV prM–E mRNA was prepared for 
vaccination by encapsulation in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), which have 
been shown to mediate efficient and prolonged protein expression by 
mRNA in vivo19. Studies of ZIKV and other flaviviruses have demon-
strated that co-expression of pre-membrane and envelope proteins is 
sufficient to assemble and secrete subviral particles12,20. ZIKV prM–E- 
encoding mRNA was first characterized by transfecting HEK293T cells 
and human and mouse dendritic cells. ZIKV envelope (E) protein was 
produced by all cell types and was secreted into the supernatant of 
HEK293T cells (Extended Data Fig. 1b). We hypothesize that dendritic 
cells also secrete E protein and that it is rapidly internalized by endocy-
tosis, as has been proposed for HIV gag21. E protein in the supernatant 
of HEK293T cells was pelleted by ultracentrifugation when incubated 
with PBS, but not with 0.5% Triton X-100, consistent with subviral 
particle production from prM–E mRNA20 (Extended Data Fig. 1c).
The immune response induced by the nucleoside-modified ZIKV 
prM–E mRNA–LNP vaccine was first analysed in C57BL/6 mice. 
Animals were immunized by intradermal injection of 30 μ 
g of ZIKV 
prM–E mRNA–LNP or polycytidylic acid (poly(C)) RNA–LNP as 
a negative control. No inflammation or other adverse events were 
observed at the sites of injection. Polyfunctional E-protein-specific 
CD4+ T cell responses were detected on the basis of intracellular IFNγ 
, 
 
TNF (also known as TNFα) and IL-2 production by splenocytes stim-
ulated with ZIKV E protein at week 2 after vaccination (Fig. 1a and 
Extended Data Fig. 2). ZIKV E-protein-specific immunoglobulin 
 
G (IgG) in the serum developed quickly in vaccinated mice and stabi-
lized at an endpoint titre of 180,000 (90 μ 
g ml−1) at weeks 8–12 (Fig. 1b 
 
and Extended Data Fig. 3a). Anti-ZIKV neutralizing antibodies 
(nAb) were measured using two independent assays: a standard

plaque-reduction neutralization test (PRNT) and a ZIKV reporter viral 
particle (RVP) assay12. The mean PRNT50 titre against ZIKV MR-766 
peaked at around 1,300 at week 8 (Fig. 1c) and was relatively stable until 
week 12. The mean RVP nAb titre (EC50) against ZIKV H/PF/2013 
reached approximately 105 at weeks 8–12 (Fig. 1d). The detection of 
higher nAb titres in the RVP assay compared to other assay formats 
similar to PRNT has previously been reported12. In addition, we noted 
that the ratio of RVP to PRNT titres was not fixed and varied with the 
animal model and viral isolate.
Immunogenicity of the nucleoside-modified ZIKV prM–E mRNA–
LNP vaccine was next evaluated in BALB/c mice. E-protein-specific 
IgG in the serum peaked at week 8 and remained stable between weeks 
8 and 20 (endpoint titres around 200,000; 90–130 μ 
g ml−1) (Fig. 1e 
 
and Extended Data Fig. 3b). PRNT50 nAb increased to a maximum 
of about 1,100 at week 16 and remained stable until week 20 (Fig. 1f). 
The RVP nAb titre rose to 50,000 at week 8 and remained above 20,000 
until week 20 (Fig. 1g).
A challenge study was conducted in BALB/c mice immunized by 
intradermal injection of 30 μ 
g of nucleoside-modified ZIKV prM–E 
mRNA–LNP or poly(C) RNA–LNP. Mice were challenged by intra-
venous injection at week 2 (short term) or week 20 (long term) 
after immunization with 200 plaque-forming units (PFU) of ZIKV 
PRVABC59. In the short-term protection study, 8 out of 9 control 
mice showed the presence of viral RNA in the blood (viraemia) by 
day 3, with a median peak of around 14,000 copies per ml. All ZIKV 
mRNA-immunized mice (n = 
 9) were protected against detectable 
viraemia (Fig. 2a). In the long-term study, all control mice (n = 
 5) 
showed viraemia on day 3, with a median peak of 1,200 copies per

ml, whereas none of the ZIKV mRNA-immunized mice (n = 
 10) had 
detectable viraemia at days 3 or 7 (Fig. 2b). These data demonstrate 
that a single immunization with nucleoside-modified ZIKV prM–E 
mRNA–LNP rapidly elicits durable protection against detectable 
 
viraemia with a heterologous ZIKV strain in mice.
We next evaluated the efficacy of the nucleoside-modified ZIKV 
mRNA–LNP vaccine in rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta), a non- 
human primate species that shows several features of ZIKV infection 
in humans22. Macaques were immunized by intradermal injection 
with doses of 600 μ 
g, 200 μ 
g or 50 μ 
g of nucleoside-modified ZIKV 
prM–E mRNA–LNP. Similar to mice, no inflammation or other adverse 
events were observed. E-protein-specific IgG and nAb were efficiently 
induced by all three vaccine doses, with no statistically significant 
differences between groups. Endpoint IgG titres rose to > 
300,000 in 
all groups at week 4 and were maintained at ≥ 
100,000 until week 12 
(Fig. 3a). PRNT50 nAb titres against MR-766 peaked at about 400 at 
week 2 (Extended Data Fig. 4a). To facilitate comparison of nAb titres 
across laboratories, the neutralization curve is shown for a human 
ZIKV-neutralizing monoclonal antibody, A3594, in the PRNT assay 
(Extended Data Fig. 5). nAb titres obtained with a focus-reduction 
neutralization test (FRNT), which has a format similar to PRNT, were 
stable around 400 against ZIKV MEX I-44 at weeks 2–12 (Fig. 3b). The 
RVP assay showed nAb titres against H/PF/2013 of around 10,000 at 
week 2 and around 17,000 at week 4 (Fig. 3c), and a titre of around 
3,000 against MR-766 at week 4 (Extended Data Fig. 4b). The neutral-
ization of viruses from both Asian and African lineages is consistent 
with a previous report demonstrating the existence of only one serotype 
of ZIKV23. The absence of a significant dose-dependent effect in the 
antibody response in any assay (Kruskal–Wallis test, P > 
 0.05) suggests 
that a low dose of 50 μ 
g (approximately 0.02 mg kg−1) was sufficient, or 
possibly more than sufficient, to induce robust anti-ZIKV immunity 
in macaques.
Rhesus macaques were challenged at week 5 by subcutaneous injec-
tion of 104 TCID50 of ZIKV PRVABC59 in five vaccinated animals 
and six control animals (Extended Data Table 1). All control animals 
became infected, with median peak plasma viraemia of 7,000 ZIKV 
RNA copies per ml (Fig. 4). By contrast, vaccinated macaques were 
highly protected against ZIKV infection. Four out of five animals—
including three that received the lowest dose of 50 μ 
g and one that 
received the medium dose of 200 μ 
g—had no detectable viraemia 
 
(< 
50 copies per ml) at all time points. We detected a low and transient 
viral blip of 100 copies per ml at day 3 after challenge in one animal 
that received the highest dose of 600 μ 
g of ZIKV prM–E mRNA–LNP, 
representing a 99% reduction in peak viraemia compared to the control 
animals. This animal exhibited among the lowest nAb titres in multiple 
assays at week 4 after vaccination: PRNT50 of 36 to MR-766, FRNT50 
of 226 to MEX I-44 and RVP titres of 986 to MR-766 and 5,812 to 
 
H/PF/2013 (Fig. 3 and Extended Data Fig. 4). The significance of a low-
level viral blip in one animal, including implications for a correlate of 
protection, are as yet uncertain and warrant further study with a greater 
number of animals.
In this report, we demonstrate that a single, low-dose intradermal 
immunization with nucleoside-modified ZIKV prM–E mRNA–LNP 
is protective in both mice and rhesus macaques and elicits higher 
nAb responses than a single immunization of multiple ZIKV vaccine 
 
candidates that have recently been reported, including purified 
 
inactivated virus (PIV) and plasmid DNA vaccines encoding prM–E 
or M–E10–12. In mice, PRNT50 nAb increased steadily over several 
months, rising to levels 50–100 times higher than those induced by 
a single immunization with PIV or DNA vaccines11,12. The ZIKV 
mRNA–LNP vaccine conferred complete, rapid and durable protec-
tion in mice that was maintained for at least 5 months, and probably 
much longer, since nAb titres were stable. The challenge studies in 
mice also showed that ZIKV PRVABC59 replicated more efficiently 
(P = 
 0.02, Mann–Whitney test) in 8-week-old BALB/c mice com-
pared to 25-week-old mice, when two identical aliquots and doses 
of challenge virus stock were used. A previous report has shown

that ZIKV-related mortality in immune-competent mice decreases 
between 1 and 4 weeks of age24, but ZIKV replication in adult mice 
has not yet been well described.
In rhesus macaques, a single immunization with 50 μ 
g ZIKV prM–E 
mRNA–LNP induced RVP nAb titres that were 50 times higher than 
those induced by one immunization with 1 mg DNA vaccine and over 
two times higher than those induced by two immunizations of DNA12, 
as measured by the same assay in the same laboratory. ZIKV mRNA–
LNP nAb titres may overlap with those elicited by one injection of PIV 
or RhAd52 ZIKV vaccines in macaques, although differences in assay 
formats prevent a precise comparison. The FRNT nAb titres elicited 
by ZIKV mRNA–LNP in macaques were maintained at a stable level 
until 12 weeks after immunization, suggesting that protection may be 
durable.
Future studies on the nucleoside-modified ZIKV mRNA–LNP 
 
vaccine will allow us to explore the effect of a boost, study the effect of 
this vaccine on other flavivirus infections and determine the efficacy 
in preventing fetal ZIKV infection and disease.

RESEARCH
METHODS
Ethics statement. Animals. The investigators adhered to the Guide for the Care 
and Use of Laboratory Animals by the Committee on Care of Laboratory Animal 
Resources Commission on Life Sciences, National Research Council. Mouse stud-
ies were conducted under protocols approved by the University of Pennsylvania 
(UPenn) IACUCs. Rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) were housed at Bioqual, 
Inc. (Rockville, MD). Macaque experiments were reviewed and approved by 
Bioqual and UPenn Animal Care and Use Committees. All animals were housed 
and cared for according to local, state and federal policies in an Association 
for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International 
(AAALAC)-accredited facility.
Human cells. Research involving human cells complied with the Declaration 
of Helsinki. De-identified leukapheresis cells were obtained from the UPenn 
Immunology Core under their Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved pro-
tocol, and were deemed exempt by the UPenn IRB.
Antibody reagents. The pan-flavivirus mouse monoclonal antibody 4G2, clone 
D1-4G2-4-15 (EMD Millipore MAB10216) was used to detect ZIKV E protein by 
western blot. The following antibodies were used for flow cytometry: anti-CD4 
PerCP/Cy5.5 (clone GK1.5, Biolegend), anti-CD3 APC-Cy7 (clone 145-2C11, 
BD Biosciences), anti-CD27 PE (clone LG.3A10, BD Biosciences), anti-TNF 
PE-Cy7 (clone MP6-XT22, BD Biosciences), anti-IFNγ 
 AF700 (clone XMG1.2, 
BD Biosciences), anti-IL-2 APC (clone JES6-5H4, BD Biosciences). The live/dead 
fixable aqua dead cell stain kit (Life Technologies) was used to discriminate dead 
cells and debris. The following antibodies were used for ELISA assays: goat anti-
mouse IgG HRP (Sigma 4416), goat anti-monkey IgG HRP (Sigma 2054) and ZIKV 
E-protein-specific monoclonal antibody NR-4747 clone E19 (BEI Resources). 
ZIKV-neutralizing human monoclonal antibody Ab3594 was provided by the Duke 
University, Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School, National University of Singapore 
team of C.E.M, G.D.S., R.P., E. E. Ooi, B.F.H., M. A. Moody, S. Lok, and H.-X. Liao.
Protein reagents. Purified recombinant ZIKV E protein (Aalto Bioreagents AZ 
6312) was used in ELISAs to detect E-protein-specific IgG, in western blots as a 
positive control and in mouse splenocyte stimulation.
mRNA production. mRNA was produced as previously described25 using T7 
RNA polymerase on linearized plasmid (pTEV-ZIKVprM-E-A101) encoding 
codon-optimized26 ZIKV strain H/PF/2013 (Asian lineage, French Polynesia, 
2013, GenBank: KJ776791) prM–E glycoproteins. mRNA was transcribed to con-
tain a 101 nucleotide-long poly(A) tail. 1-methylpseudouridine-5′ 
-triphosphate 
(TriLink) was used instead of UTP to generate modified nucleoside-containing 
mRNA. mRNA was capped using a m7G capping kit with 2′ 
-O-methyltransferase 
to obtain cap1 and was purified by a fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) 
method, as described27. mRNA was analysed by agarose gel electrophoresis and 
stored frozen at − 
20 °C.
Cell culture. Human embryonic kidney (HEK)293T cells (ATCC) were cultured 
in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 2 mM 
 
l-glutamine (Life Technologies) and 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) (HyClone) (complete 
 
medium). The HEK293T cell line was tested for mycoplasma contamination 
after receipt from ATCC and before expansion and cryopreservation. Human 
dendritic cells were generated from monocytes, as described28, and grown in 
RPMI1640 medium containing 2 mM l-glutamine (Life Technologies) and 10% 
FCS (HyClone) (complete medium) supplemented with 50 μ 
g ml−1 recombinant 
human GM-CSF and 100 μ 
g ml−1 recombinant human IL-4 (R&D systems). 
Cells were maintained by adding fresh medium containing IL-4 and GM-CSF 
every 3 days and were used on day 7. Mouse dendritic cells were generated from 
bone marrow cells obtained from the femurs of animals and grown in complete 
medium supplemented with 50 μ 
g ml−1 mouse GM-CSF (R&D systems). Cells 
were maintained by adding fresh medium containing mouse GM-CSF every 
 
3 days and were used on day 7.
mRNA transfection. Transfection of human and mouse dendritic cells and 
HEK293T cells was performed with TransIT-mRNA (Mirus Bio) according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions: mRNA (0.3 μ 
g) was combined with TransIT-mRNA 
reagent (0.34 μ 
l) and boost reagent (0.22 μ 
l) in 17 μ 
l of serum-free medium, and 
the complex was added to 2 × 
 105 cells in 183 μ 
l complete medium. Supernatant 
was collected and cells were lysed for 1 h on ice in RIPA buffer (Sigma) at 18 h 
after transfection.
Western blot analysis of envelope protein expression. Whole-cell lysates and 
supernatants from cells transfected with ZIKV prM–E were assayed for ZIKV E 
protein by non-denaturing SDS–PAGE western blot. Samples were combined with 
4 × Laemmli buffer (Bio-Rad) and separated on a 4–15% precast polyacrylamide 
Criterion TGX gel (Bio-Rad) for 45 min at 200 V
. Transfer to PVDF membrane was 
performed using a semi-dry apparatus (Ellard Instrumentation, Ltd) at 10 V for 1 h. 
The membrane was blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk in TBS buffer containing 
0.5% Tween-20. E protein was detected using 1:10,000 4G2 ascites for 1 h, followed 
by secondary goat anti-mouse IgG HRP 1:10,000 for 1 h. Antibody incubations were 
performed at room temperature in blocking buffer. Blots were developed using 
Luminata Forte substrate (Millipore) and a Kodak X-OMAT 1000A processor. 
 
At least 2 independent experiments were performed.
Characterization of E protein in supernatant. Supernatant from HEK293T cells 
transfected with ZIKV prM–E mRNA was tested for whether E protein could 
be pelleted and disrupted with detergent, consistent with subviral particles. 
Supernatant was incubated in PBS alone or PBS with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 1 h on 
ice. Samples were then spun at 42,000 r.p.m. for 2.5 h in a Beckman TLA-55 rotor. 
The supernatant was then removed from the pellet, which was resuspended in 50 μ 
l 
 
of PBS. Equal volumes of the input, pellet and post-centrifugation supernatant 
fractions were then analysed by western blot, as described above.
Lipid-nanoparticle encapsulation of the mRNA. FPLC-purified mRNA and 
polycytidylic acid (poly(C) RNA) (Sigma) were encapsulated in LNPs using a 
self-assembly process in which an aqueous solution of mRNA at pH 4.0 is rapidly 
mixed with a solution of lipids dissolved in ethanol29. LNPs used in this study 
were similar in composition to those described previously29,30, which contain an 
ionizable cationic lipid (proprietary to Acuitas), phosphatidylcholine, cholesterol 
and PEG-lipid (with a ratio of 50:10:38.5:1.5 mol/mol) and were encapsulated at 
an RNA to total lipid ratio of around 0.05 (wt/wt). The LNPs had a diameter of 
around 80 nm as measured by dynamic light scattering using a Zetasizer Nano 
ZS instrument (Malvern Instruments Ltd). RNA–LNP formulations were stored 
at − 
80 °C at a concentration of RNA of about 1 μ 
g μ 
l−1.
Administration of LNPs to mice and rhesus monkeys. Mice. Female BALB/c and 
C57BL/6 mice aged 8 weeks were purchased from Charles River Laboratories, and 
cages of mice were randomly allocated to groups. Power analysis was used to calcu-
late the size of all animal groups to ensure statistically significant results. RNA–LNP 
was diluted in PBS and injected into animals intradermally with a 3/10cc 29½G 
insulin syringe (BD Biosciences). Four sites of injection (30 μ 
l each) over the lower 
back were used.
Monkeys. Ketamine-anaesthetized animals were shaved on their back and injected 
with mRNA–LNP diluted in PBS. Ten sites of injection (60 μ 
l each) were used. 
Animals of similar age and weight were allocated to each group.
Blood collection from mice and rhesus macaques. Mice. Blood was collected 
from the orbital sinus under isoflurane anaesthesia. Blood was centrifuged for 
10 min at 13,000 r.p.m. and the serum was stored at − 
20 °C and used for ELISA 
and virus neutralization assays. EDTA-plasma was collected to isolate RNA for 
quantitative PCR with reverse transcription (qRT–PCR) analysis.
Monkeys. Blood was collected by femoral venipuncture under ketamine anaesthe-
sia, and serum and EDTA–plasma were collected and stored at − 
80 °C for ELISA, 
neutralization analysis and to isolate RNA for qRT–PCR.
Stimulation and staining of splenocytes. Single-cell suspensions from spleens 
were made in complete medium. Splenocytes were washed once in PBS and resus-
pended in complete medium at 2 × 
 107 cells per ml. Subsequently, 2 × 
 106 cells 
(100 μ 
l) per sample were stimulated for 6 h at 37 °C using 2 μ 
g ml−1 purified, recom-
binant ZIKV E protein. GolgiPlug (brefeldin A, BD Biosciences) and GolgiStop 
(monensin, BD Biosciences) were diluted 1:100 and 1:143 in complete medium, 
respectively, and 20 μ 
l from both diluted reagents was added to each sample to 
inhibit the secretion of intracellular cytokines after 1 h. An unstimulated sample for 
each animal was included. Samples stimulated with PMA (10 ng ml−1)–ionomycin 
(250 ng ml−1) (Sigma) were used as positive controls.
After stimulation, cells were washed in PBS and stained using the live/dead 
fixable aqua dead cell stain kit (Life Technologies) and then surface stained for 
CD4 and CD27. Antibodies were incubated with cells for 30 min at room tem-
perature. Following surface staining, cells were washed in FACS buffer and fixed 
using the Cytofix/Cytoperm kit (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer’s 
instructions. Following fixation, the cells were washed in the appropriate perm 
buffer and incubated with antibodies against CD3, TNF, IFNγ and IL-2 for 1 h at 
room temperature. Following staining, the cells were washed with the appropriate 
perm buffer, fixed (PBS containing 1% paraformaldehyde) and stored at 4 °C until 
analysis. Results are obtained from one technical replicate.
Flow cytometry. Splenocytes were analysed on a modified LSR II flow cytometer 
(BD Biosciences). One hundred thousand events were collected per sample. After 
the gates for each function were created, the Boolean gate platform was used to create 
 
the full array of possible combination of cytokines, equating to seven response 
patterns when testing three cytokines. Data were expressed by subtracting the 
per cent positive unstimulated cells from the per cent positive cells stimulated 
with E protein.
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) for ZIKV E-specific IgG. 
Immulon 4HXB ELISA plates were coated with 6 μ 
g ml−1 purified, recombinant 
ZIKV E protein in 0.1 M sodium bicarbonate buffer overnight at 4 °C. The plate was 
blocked with 2% BSA in PBS for 1 h, and washed three times with wash buffer (PBS

with 0.05% Tween-20). Mouse or rhesus macaque serum was diluted in blocking 
buffer and incubated on the plate for 1 h at room temperature, followed by four 
washes. Secondary HRP-conjugated antibody was diluted 1:10,000 in blocking 
buffer and incubated on the plate for 1 h, followed by four washes. TMB substrate 
(KPL) was applied to the plate and the reaction was stopped with 2 Normal sul-
furic acid. The absorbance was measured at 450 nm using an MRX Revelation 
microplate reader. ZIKV E-protein-specific IgG was analysed in two ways: as an 
endpoint dilution titre, defined as the highest reciprocal dilution of serum to give 
an OD greater than the sum of the background plus 0.01 OD units; and as an esti-
mate of the absolute IgG concentration, which was based on the mouse monoclonal 
antibody NR-4747 as a standard (applicable only to mouse samples). All samples 
were run in at least technical duplicates.
ZIKV MR-766 plaque reduction neutralization tests (PRNT). ZIKV strain 
MR-766 (African lineage, Uganda, 1947, GenBank: AY632535) (UTMB Arbovirus 
Reference Collection) was produced in Vero cells (ATCC CCL-81) and 50 PFU 
were incubated with increasing dilutions of heat-inactivated serum in serum-free 
DMEM (Corning) medium for 1 h at 37 °C. The virus–serum mixture (200 μ 
l) was 
added to a confluent monolayer of Vero cells in 6-well format and incubated for 
1.5 h at 37 °C with intermittent rocking. Then, 3 ml of overlay, containing a final 
concentration of 0.5% methylcellulose (4,000 centipoise) (Sigma), 1 × 
 DMEM 
(Gibco), 16 mM HEPES, 0.56% sodium bicarbonate, 1.6× 
 GlutaMAX (Gibco), 
1 × 
 penicillin/streptomycin (Corning), and 4 μ 
g ml−1 amphotericin B (Gibco), 
was added to each well, and plates were incubated for 5 days at 37 °C in 5% CO2. 
The overlay was aspirated and cells were fixed and stained with 0.5% crystal violet 
(Sigma) in 25% methanol, 75% deionized water. Wells were rinsed with deion-
ized water to visualize plaques. Neutralization titres (EC50) were determined by 
plotting a line through the linear portion of the curve that crossed 50% inhibition 
and calculating the reciprocal dilution of serum required for 50% neutralization 
of infection. EC50 titres are reported as the mean of one or two technical replicates 
and values below the limit of detection are reported as half of the limit of detection.
ZIKV MEX I-44 focus reduction neutralization tests (FRNT). ZIKV MEX I-44 
(Asian lineage, Mexico, 2016, GenBank: KX856011) stocks were generated in Vero 
76 cells (ATCC CRL-1587) and collected as clarified cell-culture lysate/supernatant. 
FRNT was performed by combining a standard dose of ZIKV with twofold serial 
dilutions of heat-inactivated serum for 1 h at 37 °C. Virus–serum mixtures (100 μ 
l) 
 
were then inoculated onto Vero 76 monolayers, incubated at 37 °C for 1 h and 
overlayed with an Avicel (FMC Biopolymer)-containing growth medium. After 
 
3 days of incubation, plates were formalin-fixed, permeabilized, blocked and 
stained by sequential incubation with a biotin-conjugated 4G2 monoclonal 
 
antibody (ATCC HB-112), streptavidin-HRP (BD Biosciences) and TrueBlue per-
oxidase substrate (KPL). Virus input was verified in parallel (acceptable range: 
20–60 foci). FRNT50 (EC50 titres) are reported as the highest reciprocal dilution 
giving a focus count ≤ 
 the 50% neutralization cutoff, and the geometric mean was 
computed for technical duplicates. 
Reporter virus particle (RVP) production. Pseudo-infectious RVPs were pro-
duced by complementation of a GFP-expressing WNV sub-genomic replicon23,31 
with a plasmid encoding the viral structural proteins (capsid-prM–E). Briefly, 
ZIKV MR-766 and ZIKV H/PF/2013 RVPs were produced via co-transfection 
of HEK293T cells with the structural gene and replicon plasmids (3:1 ratio by 
mass) using Lipofectamine 3000 per the manufacturer’s protocol (Invitrogen). 
Transfected cells were incubated at 30 °C and RVP-containing supernatants were 
collected on days 3–6. Stocks were passed through a 0.2-μ 
m filter and aliquots 
 
were stored at − 
80 °C until use. Stock titres were determined by infecting 
 
Raji-DCSIGNR cells with serial dilutions of filtered RVP supernatants. GFP-
positive cells were assessed by flow cytometry at 48 h after infection and RVP 
titres were calculated.
RVP neutralization assay. Previously titred RVPs were diluted to ensure antibody 
excess at informative points on the dose–response curves and were incubated with 
serial dilutions of mouse or macaque serum for 1 h at 37 °C to allow for steady-state 
binding. Raji-DCSIGNR cells were then infected with antibody–RVP complexes 
in two technical replicates. Infections were carried out at 37 °C and GFP-positive 
infected cells were detected by flow cytometry 24–48 h later. Neutralization results 
were analysed by nonlinear regression to estimate the reciprocal dilution of 
serum required for half-maximal neutralization of infection (EC50 titre) (Prism 6, 
 
GraphPad). The initial dilution of serum (on the basis of the final volume of RVPs, 
cells, and serum) was set as the limit of confidence of the assay. Titres for which 
nonlinear regression was predicted to be below this threshold were reported as a 
titre half the limit of confidence. Individual EC50 titres are reported as the geometric 
 
mean of at least 2 technical replicates.
Preparation of challenge ZIKV virus. Mice. Challenge ZIKV strain PRVABC59 
(Asian lineage, Puerto Rico, 2015, GenBank: KU501215) (BEI Resources 
NR-50240) was grown in Vero CCL81 cells. A T175 flask of cells at 75–90% con-
fluency was inoculated with an MOI of 0.01 ZIKV in 10 ml of serum-free DMEM 
medium. The flask was incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 1.5 h with intermittent 
rocking, then warmed medium was added to a final concentration of 1.5% FCS, 
1 × 
 GlutaMAX (Gibco) and 1 × 
 penicillin/streptomycin (Corning) in a final 
 
volume of 25 ml. The flask was incubated for 4 days or until cytopathic effects were 
visible. Then, the supernatant was collected, clarified by low-speed centrifugation 
and ultra-centrifuged at 20,000 r.p.m. for 1 h at 4 °C in a Sorvall SureSpin 630 rotor. 
The supernatant was removed and the pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of serum-free 
DMEM, aliquoted and stored at − 
80 °C. Before challenge, virus was thawed and 
diluted in PBS to 2,000 PFU per ml.
Monkeys. Challenge ZIKV strain PRVABC59 was grown in Vero 76 CRL-1587 cells. 
T150 flasks of cells at 80–85% confluency were used for propagation. Infection was 
performed with 100 μ 
l stock virus diluted in 4 ml of fresh L-15 medium (Gibco) 
supplemented with 10% FCS (Gibco), 10% tryptose phosphate broth (Sigma 
Aldrich), 1 × 
 penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco) and l-glutamine (Gibco) and 
adsorbed for 1 h at room temperature with gentle agitation every 15 min. Each flask 
received 7 ml of fresh L-15 medium after adsorption and was incubated for 4 days at 
37 °C. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 1,200 r.p.m. for 5 min at 4 °C 
in an Eppendorf A-4-62 rotor. Virus stocks were aliquoted and stored at − 
80 °C.
Zika virus challenge in mice and rhesus macaques. Mice. At 2 or 20 weeks after 
vaccination, mice were bled and then challenged intravenously with 200 PFU of 
ZIKV PRVABC59 in 100 μ 
l of PBS. Blood was collected 3 and 7 days after the 
challenge to determine viral loads (ZIKV RNA copies per ml) in plasma.
Monkeys. Macaques were anaesthetized with ketamine and injected subcutaneously 
in the hind thigh with 104 TCID50 of ZIKV PRVABC59 in a volume of 1 ml in PBS. 
Blood was collected 1, 3, 5, and 7 days after the challenge to determine viral loads 
(ZIKV RNA copies per ml) in plasma.
Viral load quantification (qRT–PCR). Using blinded samples, RNA was 
isolated from 200 μ 
l (macaque) or 50 μ 
l (mouse) plasma using the QIAamp 
MinElute Virus spin kit (Qiagen). Extracted RNA was used for amplifica-
tion using the SensiFAST Probe Lo-ROX One-Step Kit (Bioline BIO-78005) 
on a 7500 Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). Primers and probe 
were designed to amplify a conserved region of the capsid gene from ZIKV 
BeH815744, as follows: fwd 5′ 
-GGAAAAAAGAGGCTATGGAAATAATAAAG-3′ 
; 
 
rev 5′ 
-CTCCTTCCTAGCATTGATTATTCTCA-3′ 
; probe 5′ 
-AGTTCAAGAA 
AGATCTGGCTG-3′ 
.
Primers and probe were used at a final concentration of 2 μ 
M, and the following 
program was run: 48 °C for 30 min, 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C 
for 15 s and 1 min at 60 °C. Assay sensitivity was 50 copies per ml for macaque 
and 200 copies per ml for mouse samples. Results are calculated from at least two 
technical replicates.
Statistical analysis. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size, 
unless indicated. The investigators were not blinded to allocation during experi-
ments and outcome assessment unless indicated (qRT–PCR). GraphPad Prism 5.0f 
was used to perform Mann–Whitney and Kruskal–Wallis (with Dunn’s correction) 
tests to compare immune responses in vaccinated and control mice and in different 
dose groups of macaques, respectively. SPICE 5.35 and Microsoft Excel software 
was used to perform Student’s t-tests to compare T cell responses in vaccinated 
and control mice.

luciferase-encoding mRNA-transfected cells as a negative control. c, ZIKV 
mRNA supernatant from transfected HEK293T cells was characterized 
by ultracentrifugation in the presence and absence of 0.5% Triton X-100, 
followed by western blot of input (IN), pellet (P) and final supernatant (S) 
fractions (n = 3).

Extended Data Figure 2 | Nucleoside-modified ZIKV mRNA–LNP 
immunization elicits polyfunctional ZIKV E-protein-specific CD4+ T 
cell responses. C57BL/6 mice were immunized with 30 μ 
g of nucleoside-
modified ZIKV prM–E mRNA–LNP (n = 
 8) or control poly(C)  
RNA–LNP (n = 4). At week 2, antigen-specific CD4+ T cells were detected 
by intracellular cytokine staining. Graph shows mean ± s.e.m. of the 
frequencies of combinations of cytokines produced by CD4+ T cells.

Extended Data Figure 3 | Concentration of ZIKV E-protein-specific 
IgG in mice. a, b, Serum from C57BL/6 mice (a; n = 4 control; n = 8 ZIKV 
mRNA–LNP) or BALB/c mice (b; n = 5 control; n = 10 ZIKV mRNA–
LNP) was analysed by ELISA, and estimates of the concentration of ZIKV 
E-protein-specific IgG were calculated using the mouse monoclonal 
antibody NR-4747 as a standard. Points represent individual mice; 
horizontal lines indicate the mean. Responses in vaccine and control 
groups were compared at each time point by Mann–Whitney test,  
P < 0.01 for all comparisons.
