According to the American Diabetes Association (ADA), a 
basal bolus plus correction insulin regimen is the preferred 
treatment for non–critically ill patients with good nutritional 
intake, and use of sliding scale insulin alone is strongly dis-
couraged.1 Current guidelines for inpatient glycemic control 
recommend a goal of 140-180 mg/dl in the intensive care 
unit (ICU), with an acceptable range of 110-140 mg/dl in 
selected populations, and a preprandial goal of 140 mg/dl for 
those inpatients that are not critically ill.1,2 All guidelines 
agree that maximal inpatient glucose goals should remain 
below 180 mg/dl.1-3
Previous studies have demonstrated safe and effective 
basal bolus strategies with typically 50% of total daily 
required insulin dose as basal/long acting insulin, and 
remainder as rapid/short acting insulin with meals and/or as 
supplemental scale.4,5 The ability to demonstrate acceptable

Abstract
Background: American Diabetes Association (ADA) guidelines recommend a basal bolus correction insulin regimen as the 
preferred method of treatment for non–critically ill hospitalized patients. However, achieving ADA glucose targets safely, 
without hypoglycemia, is challenging. In this study we evaluated the safety and efficacy of basal bolus subcutaneous (SubQ) 
insulin therapy managed by providers compared to a nurse-directed Electronic Glycemic Management System (eGMS).
Method: This retrospective crossover study evaluated 993 non-ICU patients treated with subcutaneous basal bolus insulin 
therapy managed by a provider compared to an eGMS. Analysis compared therapy outcomes before Glucommander (BGM), 
during Glucommander (DGM), and after Glucommander (AGM) for all patients. The blood glucose (BG) target was set at 
140-180 mg/dL for all groups. The safety of each was evaluated by the following: (1) BG averages, (2) hypoglycemic events 
<40 and <70 mg/dL, and (3) percentage of BG in target.
Result: Percentage of BG in target was BGM 47%, DGM 62%, and AGM 36%. Patients’ BGM BG average was 195 mg/dL, 
DGM BG average was 169 mg/dL, and AGM BG average was 174 mg/dL. Percentage of hypoglycemic events <70 mg/dL was 
2.6% BGM, 1.9% DGM, and 2.8% AGM treatment.
Conclusion: Patients using eGMS in the DGM group achieved improved glycemic control with lower incidence of hypoglycemia 
(<40 mg/dL and <70 mg/dl) compared to both BGM and AGM management with standard treatment. These results suggest that 
an eGMS can safely maintain glucose control with less hypoglycemia than basal bolus treatment managed by a provider.

hypoglycemia rates during insulin therapy is of concern to 
clinicians due to the association of hypoglycemia with 
increased mortality, length of stay, and hospital complica-
tions in non–critically ill patients.6 Further insulin titration 
by health care providers has been based on paper protocols 
or clinical judgment without considering important clinical 
parameters such as renal insufficiency, nutritional intake, 
diabetes status, and glycemic target range.
Despite these guidelines and recommendations, the wide-
spread use of sliding scale insulin as the primary treatment for 
patients with hyperglycemia has persisted due in part to the 
challenges of implementing basal/bolus methodologies.7,8 
Even when basal bolus strategies are implemented, staffing 
concerns, variability in such available services, dose titration 
inertia, and the highly specialized nature of insulin use can 
make attaining adequate glycemic target ranges with subcuta-
neous insulin difficult.9
Due to the challenges of hospital management of hyper-
glycemia with insulin, emerging technologies using com-
mercial computer-guided insulin dosing software are being 
explored in the diabetes field. Several commercially avail-
able programs have FDA clearance and have been studied for 
efficacy and safety for intravenous (IV) insulin guidance in 
hospitalized patients including Glucommander™ (Glytec, 
Waltham, MA), EndoTool System™ (MD Scientific LLC, 
Charlotte, NC), and GlucoStabilizer™ (Medical Decision 
Network, Charlottesville, VA).10-17
These technologies are now expanding to include subcu-
taneous (SubQ) insulin therapy. Glucommander and 
EndoTool System are FDA cleared for SubQ insulin therapy 
in US hospitals and GlucoTab™ (Joanneum Research 
GmbH, Graz, Austria) is currently being investigated in clin-
ical trails.18 Glucommander is the first and only FDA-cleared 
comprehensive Electronic Glycemic Management System 
(eGMS) to demonstrate safety and efficacy of computerized 
software with SubQ insulin in previous studies.19-24
Methods
This retrospective observational crossover study evaluated 
the safety and efficacy of basal bolus SubQ insulin therapy 
managed by providers compared to a nurse-directed eGMS 
using Glucommander, an insulin-dosing algorithm integrated 
within the hospitals electronic health record. GM is an FDA-
cleared class II medical device for inpatient IV insulin man-
agement, IV to SubQ transition, SubQ insulin management, 
and outpatient SubQ insulin management.
The study included 993 non–critically ill patients 
(Table 1) across 9 different hospitals, and included gen-
eral medical/surgical units, cardiovascular units, emer-
gency departments, and critical care. The demographics 
and clinical characteristics of the study participants are 
presented in Table 1. Patients were treated with SubQ 
insulin therapy using eGMS and provider-managed basal 
bolus (PMBB) before and/or after eGMS during the inpa-
tient admission. The analysis included 3 treatments win-
dows: before GM BGM, during GM DGM, and after GM 
AGM.
BGM and AGM SubQ insulin therapy was directed by 
providers utilizing a computerized basal/bolus order set. 
Initial doses were prescribed by according to body weight in 
kilogram (kg) or customized at the provider’s discretion and 
titrated daily by provider order as needed. The prescribed tar-
get glucose range was 140-180 mg/dl. Basal insulin was 
given once or twice daily and prandial insulin was given 
before meals 3 times daily. Correction insulin was adminis-
tered using a low, medium or high scale based on BMI for 
each patient. Administration details in each order set indi-
cated to hold scheduled prandial insulin if the patient was not 
eating and to give basal insulin if the patient was not eating. 
There were no instructions for patients with partial meal 
intake.
DGM patients were initiated on eGMS SubQ insulin by 
provider order using a weight-based total daily dose of 0.3, 
0.5, or 0.7 units per kg to calculate basal and prandial insulin 
doses or a custom initial dose of prandial and bolus insulin. 
Correction insulin was also calculated for each patient by the 
eGMS. The prescribed target glucose range was 140-180 mg/
dl. Basal insulin was ordered once or twice daily and pran-
dial insulin was ordered before meals. Correction insulin was 
recommended as needed for hyperglycemia by eGMS before 
meals, at bedtime, or during any random BG checks. All 
daily titrations for basal, prandial insulin, and correction 
insulin doses were calculated by eGMS until the patient was 
removed from therapy and managed by the provider. Insulin 
dose adjustments DGM did not require an additional order 
from the provider.
Nurses accessed the eGMS through the electronic health 
record to receive insulin dose recommendations for prandial, 
basal, and correction insulin. Basal insulin was recom-
mended daily to the nurse through the eGMS and titrated up 
or down based on the glycemic target of 140-180 mg/dl. The 
eGMS recommended full, partial, or held prandial insulin 
doses through a series of on-screen prompts to the nurse. 
Correction insulin was recommended by the eGMS if the 
patient’s BG was above the prescribed target glucose range, 
and the correction scale adjusted daily for each patient based 
on individualized insulin sensitivity. If prandial and

Statistical Methodology
The mean with a measure of variability is reported. A sample 
preliminary test for the equality of variances indicates that 
the variances of the groups were significantly different. 
Therefore, a 2-sample t-test was performed that does not 
assume equal variance. The P value from the t-tests of the 
observed sample groups determined statistical 95% signifi-
cance. For all analyses, reported P values are 2-sided, and P 
values.05 were considered significant. Mountain States 
Health Alliance Quality Analysis using QI Macros SPC ver-
sion 2010.06 performed all statistical analyses.
Results
In the BGM group average first BG was 208 mg/dL with an 
average last BG reading of 214 mg/dL, while hypoglycemia 
<40 mg/dL was 0.14% and <70 mg/dL was 2.6%. Breakfast, 
lunch, and dinner for the BGM patients were 185, 187, and 
203 mg/dL with an overall BG average of 195 mg/dL. The 
percentage of BG > 180 mg/dL was 51% and 47% of BGs 
were in the prescribed target range.
In the DGM group average first BG was 203 mg/dL with 
an average last BG reading of 172 mg/dL, while hypoglyce-
mia <40 mg/dL was 0.06% and <70 mg/dL was 1.9%. 
Breakfast, lunch, and dinner for the BGM patients were 156, 
179, and 167 mg/dL with an overall BG average of 169 mg/
dL. The percentage of BG > 180 mg/dL was 36% and 62% of 
BGs were in the prescribed target range.
In the AGM group average first BG was 176 mg/dL with 
an average last BG reading of 181 mg/dL, while hypoglyce-
mia <40 mg/dL was 0.24% and <70 mg/dL was 2.8%. 
Breakfast, lunch, and dinner for the BGM patients were 163, 
168, and 183 mg/dL with an overall BG average of 169 mg/
dL. The percentage of BG > 180 mg/dL was 36% and 62% of 
BGs were in the prescribed target range.
Patients in the DGM group had less mild to moderate hypo-
glycemia <70 mg/dL 1.9% compared to 2.6% (P = .001) and 
2.8% (P = .001) (Figure 1). The DGM group experienced less 
severe hypoglycemia <40 mg/dl than both the BGM and AGM 
groups 0.06% compared to 0.14% (P = .38) and 0.24% (P = 
.565) (Figure 2). The percentage of BG >180 mg/dL was lower 
in the DG at 36% compared to both BGM and AGM groups at 
51% (P = .001) and 61% (P = .001) (Figure 3). The percentage 
of BG in the prescribed target range of 140-180 mg/dL was 
higher in the DGM group 62% compared to BGM (P = .002) 
and AGM 47% and 36% (P = .001) (Figure 4).
The average BG for the DGM group was 169 mg/dL com-
pared to BGM 195 mg/dL (P = .001) and AGM at 174 mg/dL 
(P = .01) (Figure 5). The average breakfast BG for DGM was 
156 mg/dL compared to BGM 185 mg/dL (P = .001) and 
AGM 163 mg/dL (P = .02) (Figure 5). The average lunch BG 
for DGM was 179 mg/dL compared to BGM 187 mg/dL 
 
(P = .03) and AGM 168 mg/dL (P = .001) with significance 
toward the AGM group (Figure 5). The average dinner BG 
for DGM was 167 mg/dL compared to BGM 203 mg/dL 
 
(P = .001) and AGM 183 mg/dL (P = .001) (Figure 5).
Demographics were identical for all 3 groups because of 
the crossover nature of the study methodology. Mean A1c 
was 8.2, mean age 64 years, 52% were female, 48% were 
male, and the mean weight 93.8 kg. Duration of therapy for 
BGM was 1.2 days, DGM 4.5 days, and AGM 4.2 days.

Discussion
Our data indicate that an eGMS can be safely and effectively 
used for basal bolus insulin therapy in the hospital setting. Basal 
bolus insulin therapy is the recommended treatment for non–
critically ill patients, however, there has been a lack of clinical 
inertia due to many barriers with implementing these regimens 
as a standard of care in today’s hospitals. Some of the challenges 
include a lack of experts such as endocrinologists, diabetologists, 
and certified diabetes educators, which can lead to in education 
deficits and knowledge gaps. Others include confusion with 
complex order sets as well as workflow difficulties, specifically 
regarding coordination of the timing of meal tray delivery, blood 
glucose checks and insulin administration. Use of an eGMS to 
standardize ordering processes and automate nursing workflow 
may help clinicians combat many of these challenges.
In basal/bolus insulin order sets, for example, rapid acting 
insulin analogues have different indications, which can lead to 
confusion among nursing staff relative to insulin administra-
tion. In the study, the eGMS demonstrated the potential to 
reduce confusion and potential for error through a series of on-
screen prompts to ensure the correct prandial and correction 
doses are calculated. The nurse simply administered the insulin 
as recommended. The PMBB orders used in the BGM and 
AGM groups had rapid acting insulin is prescribed for both 
prandial and correctional insulin dosing and scheduled during 
meal times. The administration instructions state to “hold 
prandial insulin if patient is not eating” and “give correction 
insulin per scale if above glycemic target.” Nurses must under-
stand which insulin is appropriate to give, and then perform a 
calculation at the bedside to add up the total insulin dose given 
to the patient, which can result in mathematical errors.
The eGMS provides recommendations for full, partial, or 
held insulin doses through a series of on-screen prompts to the 
nurse regarding the patient’s nutritional status. For example, 
patients who are made NPO for a procedure or surgery will 
automatically have prandial insulin held by the glycemic man-
agement system, while correction insulin may be recom-
mended if the patient is above the glycemic target. In the 
PMBB there were no instructions for patients who have poor 
appetites and may be eating partial meals. If instructions had 
been included, they would have the potential to be complex and 
would require hand calculation by the nurse at the bedside.
Others challenges with basal/bolus insulin therapies are 
related to insulin titration, which include missed opportunities 
to titrate up or down based on glycemic target ranges or confu-
sion with insulin titration calculations. Overbasalization of 
patients may be occurring in hospitals today more than is rec-
ognized, and can contribute to hypoglycemia in the inpatient 
setting overbasalization can result in low fasting blood glucose 
levels, and ultimately hypoglycemia. In addition, if basal insu-
lin is not titrated effectively, patients who are eating may expe-
rience hypoglycemia if they are suddenly made NPO or have 
other alterations in eating patters during the inpatient stay even 
if the prandial insulin is held.1,2,17 These errors with basal insu-
lin titration contribute to the fear of inpatient hypoglycemia 
among clinicians today and can lead to inappropriate holding 
of basal insulin, despite instructions to “administer basal insu-
lin even if the patient is not eating.”17
eGMSs are able to fully automate insulin titration without 
daily ordering intervention from providers. Basal insulin is 
automatically titrated to a prescribed glucose target based on 
fasting blood glucose levels, preventing overbasalization of 
patients. In addition to recommending full, partial, or held insu-
lin doses through a series of on-screen prompts to the nurse 
regarding the patient’s nutritional status, computerized glyce-
mic management systems will titrate prandial doses to pre-
scribed glycemic targets as well. As with basal insulin titrations, 
these adjustments to prandial insulin doses are fully automated 
and therefore do not require daily provider intervention.
One of the main limitations of this study is the retrospective 
nature of the analysis, which did not allow for unequivocal 
evidence of superiority of eGMS to PMBB insulin. The cross-
over design did allow for a direct comparison of provider ver-
sus computerized management of basal bolus insulin doses for 
the same patient. Further prospective studies are needed to 
determine conclusively the efficacy and safety of eGMS ver-
sus provider-managed SubQ insulin.
Conclusion
This retrospective crossover analysis investigated the efficacy 
and safety of glycemic control for patients who were treated on

SubQ basal bolus insulin managed by a provider and before and/
or after managed by an eGMS. The complexity of basal/bolus 
order sets coupled with a lack of diabetes expertise in hospitals is 
a compounding factor that can result in confusion and ultimately 
poor patient outcomes and even medical errors. Our study indi-
cates that patients managed with eGMS had a significant reduc-
tion in hypoglycemic events while maintaining an average blood 
glucose level during treatment less than 180 mg/dL and achiev-
ing 24-42% more patients in the prescribed glucose target range 
of 140-180 mg/dL. The same patients that were managed by pro-
viders before and/or after eGMS did not have an average blood 
glucose during treatment less than 180 mg/dL and also had sig-
nificantly higher hypoglycemia. There is growing evidence that 
adoption of computer-based algorithms, if implemented safely, 
could potentially reduce the need for personnel, minimize titra-
tion inertia and reduce variation in care in this arena.16,17
