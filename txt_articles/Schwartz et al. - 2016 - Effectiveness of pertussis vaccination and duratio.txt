hooping cough, or pertussis, is a 
highly contagious respiratory infec-
tion that has been inadequately con-
trolled compared with other vaccine-preventable 
diseases. The incidence of pertussis in Canada 
decreased from 156 cases per 100 000 popula-
tion during the prevaccination era to a historic 
low of 2.0 per 100 000 in 2011, increased to 13.9 
in 2012, and then decreased to 3.6 in 2013.1
Ontario, Canada’s most populous province 
with a population of 13.5 million in 2013, experi-
enced a localized outbreak in 2012. This outbreak 
started in a largely unvaccinated religious com-
munity and disproportionately affected infants, 
but then spread to the general population and 
mostly involved adolescents.2 Consequently, the 
outbreak raised questions about product-specific 
vaccine effectiveness and waning immunity.
Pertussis vaccines have been available in 
Ontario for more than 70 years. In 1997, owing 
to concerns about safety and effectiveness, acel-
lular pertussis vaccine replaced the whole-cell 
product that had been in use since 1984.3–5 In 
Ontario, only the 5-component acellular vaccine 
(containing pertussis toxoid, filamentous hemag-
glutinin, pertactin, and fimbriae types 2 and 3) 
has been available for infants and toddlers. Vac-
cination against pertussis is recommended at 2, 
4, 6 and 18 months, and at 4–6 years. In 2003, an 
adolescent dose at 14–16 years was introduced, 
and in 2011, a program was started for single-
dose adult vaccination against pertussis.6
Other jurisdictions in Canada, the United States 
and Australia have reported lower effectiveness 
with the acellular product and rapidly waning 
immunity.7–11 Canada has a unique history of using

Background: A resurgence of pertussis cases 
among both vaccinated and unvaccinated 
people raises questions about vaccine effec-
tiveness over time. Our objective was to study 
the effectiveness of the pertussis vaccine and 
characterize the effect of waning immunity 
and whole-cell vaccine priming.
Methods: We used the test-negative design, a 
nested case–control study with test-negative 
individuals as controls. We constructed multi-
variable logistic regression models to estimate 
odds ratios (ORs). Vaccine effectiveness was cal-
culated as (1 – OR) × 100. We assessed waning 
immunity by calculating the odds of develop-
ing pertussis per year since last vaccination and 
evaluated the relative effectiveness of priming 
with acellular versus whole-cell vaccine.
Results: Between Dec. 7, 2009, and Mar. 31, 
2013, data on 5867 individuals (486 test-
positive cases and 5381 test-negative con-
trols) were available for analysis. Adjusted 
vaccine effectiveness was 80% (95% confi-
dence interval [CI] 71% to 86%) at 15–364 
days, 84% (95% CI 77% to 89%) at 1–3 years, 
62% (95% CI 42% to 75%) at 4–7 years and 
41% (95% CI 0% to 66%) at 8 or more years 
since last vaccination. We observed waning 
immunity with the acellular vaccine, with an 
adjusted OR for pertussis infection of 1.27 
(95% CI 1.20 to 1.34) per year since last vacci-
nation. Acellular, versus whole-cell, vaccine 
priming was associated with an increased 
odds of pertussis (adjusted OR 2.15, 95% CI 
1.30 to 3.57).  
Interpretation: We observed high early effec-
tiveness of the pertussis vaccine that rapidly 
declined as time since last vaccination surpassed 
4 years, particularly with acellular vaccine prim-
ing. Considering whole-cell vaccine priming 
and/or boosters in pregnancy to optimize per-
tussis control may be prudent.

a whole-cell vaccine with lower effectiveness, and 
also has different secular trends in pertussis inci-
dence and vaccination coverage, necessitating local 
evaluation of the effectiveness of the pertussis vac-
cine to inform vaccination policy. Our objective 
was to study the effectiveness of the pertussis vac-
cine in Ontario while characterizing the effect of 
waning immunity and whole-cell vaccine priming.
Methods
Study population, setting and design
We linked Bordetella pertussis polymerase chain 
reaction (PCR) test results from Public Health 
Ontario Laboratory Services to population-based 
provincial health administrative data (linkage 
success rate 96%). To assess the effectiveness of 
the pertussis vaccine, we used the test-negative 
design, a type of nested case–control study often 
used to assess the effectiveness of the influenza 
vaccine because it generates unbiased estimates 
comparable to those from randomized controlled 
trials (RCTs).12–14
The study population comprised Ontario resi-
dents born between Apr. 1, 1992, and Jan. 1, 
2013. We excluded records with invalid postal 
codes, children younger than 3 months and indi-
viduals who were registered for coverage in 
Ontario’s universal health care system at 
6 months of age or older to account for those 
who may have received their primary vaccina-
tion series elsewhere. We excluded vaccinations 
given within 14 days of testing owing to insuffi-
cient time to mount an adequate immunologic 
response.
Data sources and definitions
Laboratory data
Public Health Ontario’s laboratory database con-
tains results for more than 95% of Ontario’s 
diagnostic testing for pertussis; testing is avail-
able to all Ontario physicians. The laboratory 
methods have been previously described.15–17 
Briefly, until May 28, 2012, primers targeting 
the insertion sequence IS481 were used to detect 
B. pertussis. Following this date, primers target-
ing a 50-base pair segment of the recA gene were 
also included to distinguish B. pertussis from 
Bordetella holmesii. Evaluation of the new assay 
showed that less than 1% of previously tested 
pertussis-positive specimens were B. holmesii.17 
Polymerase chain reaction tests were considered 
positive for pertussis at cycle threshold values of 
35 or less, and indeterminate at 36–40. Speci-
mens with no amplification signal were con-
sidered negative. These values were constant 
throughout the study period.
Data were available from Dec. 7, 2009, to 
Mar. 31, 2013. We defined cases as individuals 
who tested positive for B. pertussis and controls 
as those who tested negative. Indeterminate 
results were excluded from the primary analysis. 
Patients who received multiple tests within a 
90-day period were considered to have tested 
positive if they had at least 1 positive result, inde-
terminate if they received at least 1 indeterminate 
and no positive results, and negative if they 
received only negative results. No cases had 
more than 1 positive test more than 90 days apart.
Pertussis vaccination
The database of the Ontario Health Insurance 
Plan (OHIP) contains physician-billing infor-
mation on virtually all Ontario residents start-
ing Jan. 1, 1992, except for new residents 
within their first 3 months of residency.18
We classified vaccination status as up to date 
for age, partially vaccinated or unvaccinated. 
The number of age-appropriate doses is 1 dose at 
3 months, 2 doses at 5 months, 3 doses at 
7 months, 4 doses at 19 months, 5 doses at 
7 years and 6 doses at 17 years, based on Ontar-
io’s immunization schedule.6 We defined a prim-
ing series as the first 3 doses of vaccine received. 
Vaccines in Ontario are purchased centrally for 
the entire province. The Connaught whole-cell 
vaccine was available between 1992 and 1996, 
and only acellular vaccine in 1998 and later. 
Vaccines administered in 1997 were used in a 
sensitivity analysis because of uncertainty 
regarding the overlap of products used that year. 
Ontario’s immunization codes have been previ-
ously validated in infants.19 We performed a fur-
ther validation analysis of pertussis codes for this 
study (Appendix 1, available at www.cmaj.ca/
lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.160193/-/DC1).
Covariates
We used Ontario’s Registered Persons Database, 
which contains demographic information on all 
individuals with a valid Ontario health card,20 to 
obtain age, sex, socioeconomic status (approxi-
mated by neighbourhood income quintile)21 and 
rural residence (community size < 10 000). We 
used the Canadian Institute for Health Informa-
tion (CIHI) Discharge Abstract Database to iden-
tify chronic conditions.22 Health care use within 
the previous year (including physician visits, 
emergency department use and hospital admis-
sions) was enumerated using OHIP, the CIHI 
National Ambulatory Care Reporting System 
and the Discharge Abstract Database, respec-
tively. These data sets were linked using unique 
encoded identifiers and analyzed at the Institute 
for Clinical Evaluative Sciences.

Statistical analysis
The proportion of pertussis cases by time since 
last vaccination was evaluated using the 
Cochran–Armitage trend test. We used multivari-
able logistic regression models to estimate crude 
and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for pertussis 
infection, assessing participants with up-to-date 
or partial vaccination compared with unvacci-
nated participants. We stratified the data by time 
since last vaccination: 15–364 days, 1–3 years, 
4–7 years, and 8 or more years since last vaccina-
tion. These periods were selected in relation to 
age-based vaccination recommendations and 
based on expected waning of immunity from pre-
vious studies.10,23 The variables age, sex, any 
comorbidity,22 income quintile, rural residence, 
ambulatory, emergency and inpatient health care 
use in the past 12 months were selected a priori 
for inclusion in the multivariable models. We cal-
culated vaccine effectiveness as (1 – OR) × 100.24
Waning immunity of the acellular pertussis 
vaccine was further assessed in those born in 
1997 or later by estimating the odds of pertussis 
for each year following the last vaccine dose 
received, adjusted for the same covariates above, 
among those with up-to-date vaccination, those 
with either up-to-date or partial vaccination, and 
those who had received 5 or more previous 
doses of pertussis vaccine (i.e., older individuals 
who should have received the preschool diphthe-
ria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis 
[DTaP] or tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria 
toxoid, and acellular pertussis [Tdap] vaccine). 
We evaluated the relative impact of priming 
with acellular versus whole-cell vaccine in 
those aged 10 years and older who had received 
5 or more pertussis vaccinations. We con-
structed multivariable logistic regression mod-
els to estimate the odds of pertussis if the prim-
ing series used acellular vaccine only compared 
with whole-cell vaccine only, and compared 
with 1 or more doses of whole-cell vaccine.
We used the PROC LOGISTIC procedure 
(SAS 9.3) for all analyses. Type 1 error was set 
at 5% (p < 0.05). We evaluated all variables for 
multicollinearity through the variance inflation 
factor. Model fit was evaluated with the 
Hosmer–Lemeshow test.
Sensitivity analysis
Because of the potential nondifferential misclas-
sification bias of vaccination status from phys-
ician billing claims, we performed a quantitative 
sensitivity analysis that examines the impact of 
the known sensitivity and specificity of the 
exposure variable on the estimate of vaccine 
effectiveness.25 Details are in Appendix 2, avail-
able at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/
cmaj.160193/-/DC1. We evaluated the impact of 
an incomplete primary series by excluding 
infants younger than 7 months. We also analyzed 
indeterminate pertussis results, separating time 
periods (2009–2011 v. 2012–2013) and exclud-
ing cases from a localized outbreak.
Ethics approval
We received ethics approval from Public 
Health Ontario, Sunnybrook Health Sciences 
Centre and the University of Toronto.
Results
We linked 7560 individuals born after Apr. 1, 
1992, with a pertussis PCR test result between 
Dec. 7, 2009, and Mar. 31, 2013. We excluded 
1112 infants younger than 3 months, 361 people 
who registered for Ontario health insurance at 
age 6 months or older, and 220 people with inde-
terminate results. The final study population 
included 5867 participants (486 pertussis-positive 
cases and 5381 pertussis-negative controls).
Cases were older than controls by a mean of 
2.7 years (Table 1). Cases were more likely to 
reside in rural areas and to have been tested in 
2012. Controls had higher rates of comorbidi-
ties and had accessed more health care in the 
previous 12 months.
Of the 486 cases, 193 (39.7%) had up-to-
date vaccination against pertussis according to 
our definition, 134 (27.6%) were partially vac-
cinated and 159 (32.7%) were unvaccinated. 
Among the 5381 controls, 3384 (62.9%) were 
up to date, 1212 (22.5%) were partially vacci-
nated and 785 (14.6%) were unvaccinated. Of 
the participants, 120 (24.7%) cases and 1121 
(20.8%) controls had received 5 or more doses. 
Unadjusted vaccine effectiveness declined 
over time by about 10% per year since last vacci-
nation in those with up-to-date or partial vaccina-
tion (Figure 1). Correspondingly, the proportion 
of positive cases increased by about 2% each 
year since last vaccination (p < 0.001, by the 
Cochran–Armitage trend test).
Compared with unvaccinated participants, the 
adjusted estimates of vaccine effectiveness for 
participants who had up-to-date vaccination, 
stratified by time since last vaccination, were 
80% (95% CI 71% to 86%) at 15–364 days, 84% 
(95% CI 77% to 89%) at 1–3 years, 62% (95% 
CI 42% to 75%) at 4–7 years and 41% (95% CI 
0% to 66%) at 8 or more years since last vacci-
nation (Table 2). The trend was similar when we 
compared the partially vaccinated group with the 
unvaccinated group.
Individuals who received only an acellular 
vaccine had significant waning of immunity. 
 Research
E402 
CMAJ, November 1, 2016, 188(16) 
For each year that elapsed from acellular per-
tussis vaccination, there was a 27% increased 
odds of testing positive for pertussis among 
those with up-to-date vaccination for their age 
(adjusted OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.20 to 1.34). The 
sensitivity analyses had similar results, with an 
adjusted OR of 1.21 (95% CI 1.17 to 1.26) for 
those with up-to-date or partial vaccination and 
an adjusted OR of 1.21 (95% CI 1.12 to 1.30) 
for those who received the DTaP vaccine only.
Compared with those who received at least 
3 priming doses of whole-cell vaccine, individu-
als who received only acellular vaccine had an 
adjusted OR of 2.15 (95% CI 1.30 to 3.57). Com-
pared with participants who received 1 or more 
whole-cell vaccinations, those who received acel-
lular vaccine for their priming series had an 
adjusted OR of 1.82 (95% CI 1.18 to 2.82). The 
results from the sensitivity analysis evaluating 
participants who received a dose in 1997 
assigned as either whole cell or acellular were 
similar (data not shown).
Sensitivity analysis
Accounting for nondifferential misclassification 
bias of vaccination status, vaccine effectiveness 
increased from 80%–85% to 95% or greater 
within 3 years since last vaccination. However, 
vaccine effectiveness was 63% after 4–7 years 
and declined to 22% (95% CI –70% to 73%) after 
8 or more years (Table 2, Appendix 2). Excluding 
infants with an incomplete primary series, vaccine 
effectiveness increased within 1 year from last 
vaccination from 80% to 87%. Individuals tested 
in 2012–2013 were the main drivers of the wan-
ing immunity observed (Table 2).
Interpretation
We observed high effectiveness of the pertussis 
vaccine within 3 years of vaccination, but with 
clear evidence of waning of immunity beyond 
4 years and little-to-no protection beyond 7 years 
from last vaccination. The odds of pertussis 
increased by 27% each year that passed after 
receipt of an acellular vaccine. Individuals 
primed with acellular vaccine had a 2.2 times 
higher odds of disease than those primed with the 
previously used whole-cell vaccine.
Recent observational studies from the US 
have yielded some comparable results.10,11,26–28 
Our analysis, which is stratified by time since 
last vaccination and adjusted for age, suggests 
that the low estimates of vaccine effectiveness 
beyond 4 years from last vaccination are attrib-
utable to waning immunity. A recent meta-
analysis identified an increased odds of pertus-
sis of 33% for each year following the DTaP 
dose.23 That meta-analysis supports our finding 
that beyond 7 years since the last vaccination 
there is minimal protective effect of the vac-
cine, despite some evidence showing persistent 
humoural immunity.29 The findings of the cur-
rent study are important because of its context.

received a 5-component acellular vaccine with 
consistently high coverage levels, had a history 
of a different whole-cell vaccine from the US 
and had no substantial population-wide resur-
gences of disease, yet our results showed simi-
lar rapid waning of immunity. Furthermore, our 
finding that the low-effectiveness whole-cell 
vaccine is still better for priming than the cur-
rently used acellular vaccine nearly 2 decades 
after the change in practice has profound impli-
cations for understanding the effectiveness of 
the pertussis vaccine.
Ontario transitioned to acellular vaccines 
owing to concerns about safety and effectiveness 
of the whole-cell vaccine used in Canada. Obser-
vational data from Canada, Australia and the US 
have shown greater protection with whole-cell 
infant priming.7–9 We were surprised to see a sig-
nificant protective effect, given the estimated low 
effectiveness of this particular whole-cell vaccine 
of 49%–61%.3–5 However, our results showed 
that receiving 1 or more doses of whole-cell vac-
cine as an infant provided significant protection 
from pertussis more than a decade later.
Immunization advisory committees in Canada 
and the US recommend a Tdap booster for ado-
lescents and adults. However, uptake of these 
recommendations as measured by pertussis vac-
cine coverage in Ontario and Canada has been 
about 70% among adolescents and only 7% 
among adults.30–33 Given our data, combined 
with reports from others,10,11 it is unsurprising 
that we are witnessing a resurgence of pertussis 
in adolescents and adults.2,11 The presence of a 
large susceptible population puts young infants, 
in whom virtually all of the morbidity and mor-
tality is observed, at risk of acquiring infection.1
Our findings suggest the need to reconsider 
our strategy for pertussis vaccination. In Ontario, 
individuals currently aged 18 years and younger 
have received only acellular vaccines, creating a 
large susceptible population. Vaccination in 
pregnancy is recommended in the US and the 
United Kingdom, and is likely an effective strat-
egy to reduce disease in infants.34 We recom-
mend that decisions to strengthen control of per-
tussis be informed by dynamic modelling to 
compare the relative costs and benefits of differ-
ent strategies. Consideration should also be 
given to introducing whole-cell vaccine for 
infant priming given the observational data 
showing significant long-term protective effects 
combined with the discovery that many cases of 
encephalopathy, temporally associated with the 
diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and pertussis 
(DTP) vaccine, were not causally attributable to 
pertussis vaccines.35,36 A recent model evaluating 
a 1-dose whole-cell priming strategy suggests 
that this approach is highly cost-effective.37 The 
benefit of additional boosters likely varies based 
on the cause of pertussis resurgence, which sug-
gests that a better understanding of the current 
epidemiology of pertussis is critical for optimiz-
ing public policy.38

Limitations
There is potential for false-negative results 
(cases being misclassified as controls) with the 
test-negative design, which would tend to 
underestimate vaccine effectiveness. However, 
test-positive cases are likely more severe than 
all pertussis cases in the population,39 thereby 
potentially overestimating vaccine effective-
ness. This design minimizes the bias related to 
health care–seeking behaviour and has been 
validated against RCT data for other infections 
such as influenza and respiratory syncytial 
virus.14 In Ontario, pertussis vaccinations are 
administered predominately through physician 
offices. Nonetheless, some misclassification bias 
of vaccination status was observed. Our sensitiv-
ity analysis showed an underestimation of early 
vaccine effectiveness with a more dramatic wan-
ing of immunity over time. We incorporated all 
clinically relevant available covariates in the 
multivariable models to adjust for potential con-
founding; however, additional unmeasured con-
founders that could not be captured by adminis-
trative data are possible.
Conclusion
We identified good early vaccine effectiveness, 
which rapidly declined when time since last vac-
cination surpassed 4 years, in a population with 
relatively stable disease incidence. We also iden-
tified a significant protective effect from priming 
with a low-effectiveness whole-cell product. 
This study highlights the need to re-evaluate 
strategies for pertussis vaccination in Canada 
and to spur vaccine development.
