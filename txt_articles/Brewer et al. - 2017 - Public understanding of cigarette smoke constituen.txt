Abstract
Introduction—The Tobacco Control Act requires public disclosure of information about toxic 
constituents in cigarette smoke. To inform these efforts, we studied public understanding of 
cigarette smoke constituents.
Methods—We conducted phone surveys with national probability samples of adolescents 
(n=1125) and adults (n=5014) and an internet survey with a convenience sample of adults 
(n=4137), all in the USA. We assessed understanding of cigarette smoke constituents in general 
and of 24 specific constituents.
Results—Respondents commonly and incorrectly believed that harmful chemicals in cigarette 
smoke mostly originate in additives introduced by cigarette manufacturers (43–72%). Almost all 
participants had heard that nicotine is in cigarette smoke, and many had also heard about carbon 
monoxide, ammonia, arsenic and formaldehyde. Less than one-quarter had heard of most other 
listed constituents being in cigarette smoke. Constituents most likely to discourage respondents

 from wanting to smoke were ammonia, arsenic, formaldehyde, hydrogen cyanide, lead and 
uranium. Respondents more often reported being discouraged by constituents that they had heard 
are in cigarette smoke (all p<0.05). Constituents with names that started with a number or ended in 
‘ene’ or ‘ine’ were less likely to discourage people from wanting to smoke (all p<0.05).
Discussion—Many people were unaware that burning the cigarette is the primary source of 
toxic constituents in cigarette smoke. Constituents that may most discourage cigarette smoking 
have familiar names, like arsenic and formaldehyde and do not start with a number or end in ene/
ine. Our findings may help campaign designers develop constituent messages that discourage 
smoking.
INTRODUCTION
Smoking cigarettes is one of the leading causes of preventable deaths in the USA and 
globally.12 Inhalation of smoke directly from cigarettes and secondhand smoke exposes 
people to scores of toxic constituents (chemicals), many of which have been directly 
implicated in the cardiovascular, respiratory and carcinogenic health effects of smoking.3–5 
Tobacco products and cigarette smoke have at least 93 harmful and potentially harmful 
constituents.5 In the USA, the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act 
requires tobacco companies to provide information about cigarette smoke constituents by 
brand and subbrand to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).67 The law also requires 
FDA to disclose this information to the public in a way that is understandable and not 
misleading to a layperson.6
Research exploring how to most effectively communicate about tobacco and tobacco product 
constituents is at an early stage. Our recent review of the literature found low awareness and 
knowledge about cigarette smoke constituents other than nicotine and tar.8–14 Additionally, 
our review also found that people are interested in learning more about these 
constituents.81516 However, the literature has large gaps. While studies have examined 
awareness of a handful of constituents, we know little about the public’s understanding of 
many other harmful constituents.15 We also know little about how people think about 
constituents, including their origins or how cigarette filters affect exposure to 
constituents.91718
The goal of our paper is to identify ways to improve communication about cigarette smoke 
constituents in order to improve tobacco prevention and control efforts. In our prior 
qualitative research, familiar-sounding constituents appeared to elicit concern, while 
unfamiliar constituent names led people to search for meaning by using any available clues, 
including making associations to other words that sound or look similar.1920 We 
hypothesised that constituent names that are more familiar to people or have less technical 
sounding names (ie, no numerical prefix, shorter) would elicit more discouragement from 
wanting to smoke. Since we noticed that many constituent names have similar endings (eg, 
ine/ene as in nicotine or ide/yde as in formaldehyde), we sought to examine whether certain 
constituent name endings elicited more discouragement. Finally, smokers are well known to 
express less concern about the harms of smoking. Thus, we hypothesised constituents would 
elicit less discouragement among smokers and among groups with higher smoking

 prevalence, such as men, individuals with lower levels of education and gay, lesbian and 
bisexual (GLB) respondents.
METHODS
Participants
Adult phone survey sample—The Carolina Survey Research Laboratory (CSRL) at the 
University of North Carolina recruited a probability sample of 5014 adults living in the 
USA. From September 2014 to May 2015, CSRL recruited participants through random-
digit-dial landline and cell phone frames, resulting in about 98% coverage of the US 
population. Geographic and household-based oversampling in areas with higher rates of 
poverty and smoking, as well as oversampling respondents with certain characteristics at the 
household level, resulted in a sample that had higher rates of smoking, poverty and young 
adults than the US population. To be eligible for study participation, adults had to be 18 
years or older and speak English or Spanish. Elsewhere, we provide additional details on 
sampling design, survey methods and sample characteristics.21 The response rate among 
adults was 42%, calculated using American Association for Public Opinion Research 
formula 4.22
Adolescent phone survey sample—From November 2014 to June 2015, CSRL 
recruited a separate probability sample of 1125 adolescents living in the USA, using 
random-digit-dial and list-assisted sampling frames. As with the adult sample, CSRL 
oversampled counties with higher prevalence of smokers and poverty. To be eligible for 
study participation, adolescents had to be ages 13–17 and speak English or Spanish. 
Interviewers obtained verbal consent from adolescents’ parents or guardians and verbal 
assent from the adolescents. The response rate among adolescents was 66%, calculated 
using American Association for Public Opinion Research formula 4.22
Adult internet survey sample—Through Amazon Mechanical Turk, an online 
recruitment tool, our staff recruited a national convenience sample of 4137 adults (ages 18 or 
older who spoke English or Spanish) living in the USA, in December 2014. The online 
advertisement for the survey encouraged current smokers to participate.
The University of North Carolina’s institutional review board approved all three studies.
Measures
Phone and internet surveys used the same question order, wording and response scales, with 
small adjustments as needed for the internet survey. As part of an iterative measures 
development process intended to verify that participants assigned the meaning to surveys 
items that we intended, we conducted cognitive interviews and a survey pilot among diverse 
samples of adolescents and adults, including adults with low and high education.
Constituents in general—The survey first assessed perceived source of cigarette smoke 
constituents: ‘Where do you think most of the harmful chemicals in cigarettes and cigarette 
smoke come from?’ with response options ‘tobacco before it is made into cigarettes’, 
‘tobacco additives’ or ‘burning the cigarettes’. The survey next assessed the perceived

 impact of cigarette filters using the question, ‘Do you think the cigarette filter traps…’ with 
response options ‘all of the harmful chemicals in cigarette smoke’ (coded as 1), ‘a lot of 
them’ (2), ‘some of them’ (3) or ‘none of them’ (4).
Specific constituents—We randomised participants to 1 of 6 survey panels, each of 
which had questions about four different cigarette smoke constituents (see online 
supplementary table S1). The 24 selected constituents included the 18 on FDA’s abbreviated 
list, 5 from the FDA’s complete list of 93 constituents and ‘nitrosamine’.57 We added 
‘nitrosamine’ as it is a more accessible term to refer to N-nitrosonornicotine (NNN) and 
nicotine-derived nitrosamine ketone (NNK), two of the most harmful constituents in 
cigarette smoke.23 To examine the effect of using an acronym for the nitrosamines, the 
surveys used ‘NNK’ when referring to nicotine-derived nitrosamine ketone.
The surveys assessed awareness that each of the four constituents from the assigned panel 
are in cigarette smoke: ‘Before today, had you ever heard that [constituent] is in cigarette 
smoke?’. We coded responses of yes as 1 and other responses as 0. The survey next assessed 
perceived harmfulness for each constituent the respondent had heard is in cigarette smoke 
with the measure, ‘As far as you know, how harmful is [constituent] in cigarette smoke?’. 
The four-point response scale ranged from ‘not at all’ (coded as 1) to ‘extremely harmful’ 
(4). Finally, the survey assessed, ‘How much does [constituent] being in cigarette smoke 
discourage you from wanting to smoke?’. The four-point response scale ranged from ‘not at 
all’ (coded as 1) to ‘a lot’ (4).24 We chose discouragement from wanting to smoke because 
smokers could interpret this as quitting smoking and non-smokers as not starting to smoke. 
We coded constituent names for three characteristics: beginning, ending and length. 
Beginnings were either a number or not. Endings were ‘ene’/‘ine’, ‘ide’/‘yde’ and other. 
Length was the number of characters in the constituent name.
Demographics—The survey assessed participant characteristics, including age, sex, 
sexual orientation (or sexual interest, among adolescents), race, Hispanic ethnicity, 
education (or education of mother, among adolescents), numeracy and smoking status.25 
Numeracy was assessed with the item, ‘In general, which of these numbers shows the 
biggest risk of getting disease?’.26 The three response options were ‘one in 10’, ‘one in 100’ 
and ‘one in 1000’, with only the first response coded as correct (ie, high numeracy). We 
defined being a current smoker as smoking some days or every day and having smoked 100 
or more cigarettes in one’s lifetime among adults, and among adolescents as having smoked 
during at least 1 of the past 30 days.2728
Data analysis
We used χ2 tests to compare smokers’ and non-smokers’ beliefs about where constituents 
originate and t-tests to compare their beliefs about the impact of cigarette filters. We report 
percentages or means for awareness, perceived harm and discouragement for each of the 24 
constituents. For analyses of data from the adult and adolescent phone surveys, we used 
sample design and sample weights to account for study design and generate nationally 
representative estimates (percentages and means), and we report unweighted frequencies.

 We examined correlates of discouragement from wanting to smoke after hearing that a 
particular constituent is present in cigarette smoke. We dichotomised the outcome of 
discouragement from wanting to smoke, so that we could compare responses of ‘a lot’ 
(coded as 1) to other responses (0), in order to address skewing. One set of predictors were 
the participant characteristics shown in table 1, with age mean-centred and scaled in decades 
to make the estimate more interpretable. Another set of predictors were characteristics of 
constituents: awareness that the constituent is in cigarette smoke; and constituent name 
beginning (did or did not start with a number), ending (‘ene’/‘ine’, ‘ide’/‘yde’, other) and 
length (number of characters). The multilevel analyses used the SAS PROC GLIMMIX 
procedure with quasi-likelihood estimation, a log link function specified with a binary 
distribution, a random intercept and random effects, where appropriate; used the Newton-
Raphson algorithm for the optimisation technique; controlled for constituent panel; and did 
not use survey weights. Models treated constituent characteristics as random effects and 
then, if not statistically significant, as fixed effects. We conducted sensitivity analyses by 
repeating the analyses without data for nicotine to see whether it accounted for the study 
findings for constituent name ending. We analysed data separately for the three surveys. We 
conducted analyses in SAS V.9.3 (SAS Institute, 2011) and used two-tailed statistical tests 
with a critical α of 0.05.
RESULTS
Respondents represented diverse demographic groups, including African-Americans (range 
8–18% across the three surveys), Hispanics (8–14%) and GLBs (3–12%) as shown in table 
1. Current smokers were present in all samples but most common in the internet sample 
(35%) and least common in the adolescent sample (3%).
Perceived source of constituents
Adults commonly believed that most of the constituents in cigarette smoke come from 
chemicals added by cigarette manufacturers (phone 61%; internet 72%). Relatively few 
adults believed that constituents come from burning the cigarette (phone 31%; internet 24%) 
or from tobacco before it is made into a cigarette (phone 8%; internet 4%). Adult smokers 
were more likely than non-smokers to believe that constituents come from additives and less 
likely to believe that constituents came from burning the cigarette (all p<0.05, table 2). 
Adolescents believed, in roughly equal measure, that constituents in cigarette smoke come 
from additives (43%) or from burning the cigarette (46%). Adolescent smokers and non-
smokers showed few differences, perhaps due to the adolescent sample having few smokers.
The belief that cigarette filters trap all of the harmful chemicals in cigarette smoke was held 
by many adults (phone 33%; internet 22%) and adolescents (27%). Adult smokers believed 
that cigarette filters remove more harmful chemicals from cigarette smoke than non-smokers 
(weighted means: 1.81 (SE=0.02) vs 1.90 (SE=0.04), p=0.04) in the phone survey. Beliefs 
about the filter’s effectiveness did not differ between smokers and non-smokers in the adult 
online sample or in the adolescent sample.

 Awareness and perceived harmfulness of constituents
The constituent that most participants had heard is in cigarette smoke was nicotine (89–
95%) (table 3). Other commonly heard-of constituents were carbon monoxide (59–70%), 
ammonia (39–53%), arsenic (42–66%) and formaldehyde (41–68%). Fifteen constituents 
had awareness levels below 25% in all three samples. Awareness of NNN showed the most 
variability across the samples, with relatively high awareness in the phone survey (39% of 
adults, 62% of adolescents) and low awareness in the internet survey (15% of adults), 
perhaps because hearing the constituent name read aloud drew attention to its ‘nicotine’ 
ending. Perceived harmfulness exhibited no clear pattern of results across the samples, other 
than acrylonitrile, hydrogen cyanide and uranium having higher perceived harmfulness 
ratings in two of the three samples (table 3).
Discouragement from wanting to smoke
Across all three samples, ammonia, arsenic, formaldehyde, hydrogen cyanide, lead and 
uranium elicited the highest discouragement from wanting to smoke (table 3). The most 
discouraging constituents represented a range from low to moderate awareness, as shown in 
figure 1 and online supplementary figures S1 and S2. Acrolein was the least discouraging 
constituent for all samples. Nicotine and 2-aminonaphthalene were least discouraging 
among adults, and benzene and toluene were least discouraging among adolescents.
Discouragement from wanting to smoke was greater for constituents that adults had heard 
are in cigarette smoke than for ones they had not (71% vs 68% phone survey, aOR=1.19, 
95% CI 1.04 to 1.35; 46% vs 34% internet survey, aOR=2.02, 95% CI 1.79 to 2.27) in 
adjusted analyses (table 4). The same was true for adolescents (82% vs 74%, aOR=1.84, 
95% CI 1.41 to 2.41). Among adults, discouragement was lower for constituent names that 
started with a number than those that did not start with a number (66% vs 70% phone 
survey, aOR=0.76 95% CI 0.64 to 0.91; 30% vs 39% internet survey, aOR=0.76, 95% CI 
0.64 to 0.90). Adolescents showed a similar pattern that was not statistically significant.
Discouragement was lower for constituents that ended in ‘ene’ or ‘ine’ than for constituents 
that ended in ‘ide’ or ‘yde’, among adults (67% vs 72% phone survey, aOR=1.43, 95% CI 
1.23 to 1.68; 31% vs 44% internet survey, aOR=2.21, 95% CI 1.92 to 2.55) and adolescents 
(73% vs 81%, aOR=1.79 95% CI 1.27 to 2.52), or for any other endings (table 4). The same 
pattern of findings appeared in sensitivity analyses that omitted data for nicotine (data not 
shown).
Shorter constituent names were more discouraging for all samples in unadjusted analyses 
(see online supplementary table S2), but adjusting only for constituent awareness caused 
these findings to lose statistical significance (table 4). In the fully adjusted models, longer 
names were more discouraging for the adult phone sample. Sensitivity analyses dropping 
constituent name length from the adjusted models showed roughly identical findings for the 
other variables.
With respect to participant characteristics, discouragement elicited by constituents was much 
higher among non-smokers than smokers across the three samples in adjusted analyses. For 
example, in the phone survey, 78% of adult non-smokers but only 38% of adult smokers said

 the constituents would discourage them from wanting to smoke (aOR=0.09, 95% CI 0.07 to 
0.11), numbers that were nearly identical for adolescents (79% vs 37%, aOR=0.08, 95% CI 
0.04 to 0.17). Discouragement was also more common among women and whites in all three 
samples as well as adult Hispanics and less common among adult GLBs. In addition, 
discouragement was higher among adults who attended college and adolescents whose 
mothers had attended college and more numerate adults than among those with lower 
education or numeracy. Finally, discouragement was highest at younger ages among 
adolescents and older ages among adults.
DISCUSSION
Across three national samples that included a total of over 10 000 US adults and adolescents, 
we found that many people lacked a basic understanding of the origin of harmful chemicals 
in cigarette smoke. Many people did not understand that most toxic constituents in cigarette 
smoke come from burning the cigarette rather than from cigarette manufacturer additives. 
Many also incorrectly believed that cigarette filters trap the toxic chemicals in cigarette 
smoke. On a more positive note, we identified several principles that could inform 
communications about cigarette smoke constituents. People were most discouraged by 
familiar constituents with names that started with letters rather than numbers, but were less 
discouraged by ones ending with ‘ine’ as in the familiar constituent nicotine.
Most toxic chemicals develop as the cigarette burns and do not primarily come from 
cigarette additives.23 The tobacco industry has invested heavily in promoting ‘additive-free’ 
cigarettes.29 We speculate that exposure to this advertising may have contributed to the 
finding that people believe added chemicals, not chemicals inherent to the tobacco leaf and 
burning of cigarettes, are responsible for cigarettes’ toxicity. Another misconception noted 
in our study is the belief that cigarette filters trap most of the harmful substances in cigarette 
smoke. Future public health communications about cigarette smoke constituents should 
consider that many people hold erroneous beliefs. Educational campaigns and other 
communication vehicles such as cigarette pack constituent disclosures could attempt to 
address these misunderstandings.
One of the most important constituent communication principles that we identified is that 
familiar constituents appear to discourage more people from wanting to smoke than less 
familiar ones. This finding confirms and extends the previous findings of Hall et al and is 
consistent with other research on constituents.815 Health communication campaigns may 
still be able to productively focus on less familiar constituents; however, more research is 
needed on how to best address low understanding of these unfamiliar cigarette smoke 
constituents. Campaigns with substantial resources could improve the public’s knowledge of 
one or two specific constituents, with the goal of simultaneously increasing awareness and 
discouraging smoking. For example, nitrosamines and acrolein had low awareness and were 
least discouraging, but research shows these are two of the most harmful constituents in 
cigarette smoke.30–32 Informing the public about these harmful chemicals in cigarette smoke 
may be particularly important.

 Other important constituent communication principles that we identified relate to constituent 
name characteristics. Constituent names that started with a number elicited less 
discouragement, perhaps because these names seemed technical, which may have prevented 
participants from creating meaning.20 Constituent names ending with text that sounded like 
‘ene’ were also less discouraging. We speculate that this may be due in part to an association 
with nicotine, a constituent that is widely associated with cigarettes but is among the least 
discouraging. It could also be that endings that sounded like ‘ide’ benefit from associations 
with highly discouraging constituent names like formaldehyde. This insight follows from 
some of our previous qualitative research, indicating that unfamiliar constituents lead people 
to find similar sounding words to establish meaning.20 These speculations on the mechanism 
driving constituent name effects require further study.
Demographic differences in discouragement from wanting to smoke followed disparities in 
smoking prevalence and sequelae. Differences by smoking status were the most dramatic, 
with smokers being consistently much less discouraged than non-smokers. This finding may 
be an example of rejection of risk information by smokers, a common finding, or it may be a 
realistic self-assessment that health information on its own may not be enough to counteract 
the potent, addictive hold that cigarettes have on smokers.33 Other disparities, found even 
after controlling for smoking status, followed patterns of smoking prevalence or risk. 
Discouragement was lower among respondents with lower education, sexual minorities, 
younger adults and older teens. The findings for smoking status, age (among adults) and 
education mirror previous findings reported by Hall et al.15 The findings for race and sex are 
similar to the ‘white male effect’, a general pattern of findings in which this group 
minimises their risks for many potential harms.34 Mode of constituent information delivery, 
read aloud or in print, may also affect constituent perceptions.35 Our findings for phone and 
internet studies were largely concordant, but larger differences for constituent names endings 
in the online sample merit further exploration. Demographic disparities and mode effects 
merit special attention in the design and implementation of future research on the impact of 
constituent messages that could be delivered via communication campaigns, disclosures on 
cigarette packs, or through other means.
Our study’s strengths include the use of probability sampling for adults and adolescents in 
the phone survey; careful survey development and testing through cognitive interviews and 
pilot testing; and replication of many of our findings across three different samples. 
Limitations to the study include the use of cross-sectional studies that limit causal inferences 
about many of the associations we report. We relied on single-item measure for most 
constructs. The impact of constituent information on behaviour may differ, though these 
perceived effectiveness measures are often good correlates of intentions and behaviour and 
useful in the early stages of message development.3637 We focused on the 18 constituents in 
the FDA’s abbreviated list, but as measurement approaches become more refined and widely 
available, other constituents may be important to study as well. Though we weighted point 
estimates for phone survey participants, we did not use weights in our multilevel analyses of 
discouragement as these methods are not yet well developed. Point estimates differed across 
the survey modes, but the pattern of associations with other variables showed many 
similarities. The fixed order of constituent names within panels and different composition of 
constituents across panels may have had some effect. Future work could include

 randomisation to more evenly distribute order effects and constituent names artificially 
created to reflect the dimensions we examined.
As our studies are among the first to identify elements of constituent names that discourage 
smoking, future research should aim to replicate our findings and further fill gaps in our 
understanding of how best to communicate about cigarette smoke constituents. The 
widespread misunderstandings that constituents come from tobacco additives highlight the 
importance of banning the use of ‘additive-free’ and similar terms that falsely suggest 
healthfulness and risk reduction; however, educational campaigns may more effectively 
improve understanding of constituents than dispel myths about additives.38 Given the current 
public understanding of constituents, arsenic and formaldehyde are promising topics for 
campaigns. We had hoped that useful topics would include nitrosamines and acrolein, two 
particularly harmful cigarette smoke constituents, but they had low awareness and generally 
elicited less discouragement than other constituents.2332 If campaigns can invest resources to 
remedy low awareness, nitrosamines and acrolein may be important topics for health 
messages. Even though these constituents had low awareness and elicited less 
discouragement and have the ‘ine’ ending, they are important because they are particularly 
harmful. However, it may be more beneficial to develop awareness around acrylonitrile or 
various aldehydes as they do not have the less discouraging ‘ine’ ending reminiscent of 
nicotine. Research on messages and delivery channels to effectively communicate with the 
public about harmful constituents are an important next step for the field.

 What this paper adds
•
US Food and Drug Administration is required to inform the public about toxic 
constituents (chemicals) in cigarette smoke.
•
Prior research suggests that many US adults are not aware of cigarette smoke 
constituents other than nicotine and tar.
•
Little research describes how the public understands constituents, particularly 
lesser known constituents, and their origins.
•
These 3 national surveys of more than 10 000 US adults and adolescents 
found that most respondents mistakenly believed that constituents come from 
tobacco additives rather than burning the cigarette.
•
Participants were more discouraged from smoking by constituents that they 
had heard of (eg, arsenic and formaldehyde) and less discouraged by 
constituents that started in a number or ended in ‘ene’/‘ine’ (eg, 1-
aminonapthalene).
•
In order to reduce smoking, future public health communications might focus 
on the constituents that are most discouraging or attempt to raise awareness of 
lesser known but highly toxic constituents.

Percentages for phone surveys are weighted. Three constituents with the highest values for each survey sample in bold. Response scale for perceived harm and discouragement ranged from ‘not at all’ 
(coded as 1) to ‘a lot’ (coded as 4). For awareness, the median SEs were 2%/3%/1% in adult phone/adol. phone/internet surveys. For perceived harm, the median SEs were 0.10/0.08 in phone/internet 
surveys. For discouragement, the median SEs were 0.06/0.04 in phone/internet surveys. Perceived harm assessed only for participants aware the constituent was in cigarette smoke. Percentages and means 
for phone survey were weighted.
