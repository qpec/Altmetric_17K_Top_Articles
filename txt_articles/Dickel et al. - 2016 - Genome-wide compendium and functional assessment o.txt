Whole-genome sequencing is identifying growing numbers of non-coding variants in human
disease studies, but the lack of accurate functional annotations prevents their interpretation.
We describe the genome-wide landscape of distant-acting enhancers active in the developing
and adult human heart, an organ whose impairment is a predominant cause of mortality and
morbidity. Using integrative analysis of 435 epigenomic data sets from mouse and human
pre- and postnatal hearts we created a comprehensive reference of 480,000 putative
human heart enhancers. To illustrate the importance of enhancers in the regulation of genes
involved in heart disease, we deleted the mouse orthologs of two human enhancers near
cardiac myosin genes. In both cases, we observe in vivo expression changes and cardiac
phenotypes consistent with human heart disease. Our study provides a comprehensive
catalogue of human heart enhancers for use in clinical whole-genome sequencing studies and
highlights the importance of enhancers for cardiac function.

ardiovascular disease is the most common cause of death
worldwide1. Diseases of the heart include a spectrum of
adult-onset conditions, as well as congenital phenotypes
that collectively represent the most common category of severe
birth defects2. Causes of heart disease include environmental risk
factors1, common variants with moderate effect sizes3, and rare
and de novo mutations that cause familial cases with Mendelian
inheritance patterns3. In particular for the latter category,
candidate gene sequencing has proven powerful for obtaining
molecular diagnoses. For example, for familial hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy, candidate gene sequencing identifies a clear
genetic cause in B60% of patients4. Nevertheless, this approach is
by design limited to the coding sequence of candidate genes
and fails to identify non-coding mutations. Whole-genome
sequencing
(WGS)
can
in
principle
detect
non-coding
mutations and is becoming increasingly adopted for patients
with unexplained heart disease5. However, early WGS studies
illustrate major challenges in the interpretation of non-coding
variants, and particularly of rare non-coding variants6. In the
absence of accurate annotations linking non-coding loci to in vivo
functions, non-coding WGS findings are largely uninterpretable
and, thereby, most cases with non-coding mutations remain
unresolved.
To address the pressing need for a high-quality, genome-wide
annotation of functional non-coding sequences active in the
developing and adult heart, in the present study we describe a
comprehensive catalogue of more than 80,000 candidate distant-
acting cardiac enhancers (Fig. 1). Enhancers are a major category
of non-coding regulatory elements that activate gene expression
from a distance in a cell type-specific7 and temporally restricted8
manner. They are hypothesized to play a major role in
development and disease, and sequence variants that alter
enhancer function are associated with a variety of human
phenotypes (for example, refs 9–11). We derived the heart
enhancer compendium from more than three dozen epigenomic
data sets mapping enhancer-associated chromatin marks in
developing and adult heart tissue from mice and humans. This
catalogue
of
human
heart
enhancers
can
be
easily
and
immediately implemented in human disease studies, and to
further facilitate its utilization in clinical studies, we provide
confidence scores for each predicted enhancer that correlate
strongly with in vivo validation rates. We find that more than
2,000 human variants implicated in heart-related phenotypes
through genome-wide association studies (GWAS), either directly
as lead variants or indirectly by linkage disequilibrium (LD),
fall into putative heart enhancers. Anticipating downstream
validation of WGS studies, which will likely focus first on
regulatory sequences near genes already implicated in disease, we
experimentally validated putative enhancers and provide in vivo
characterization of more than 20 novel cardiovascular enhancers
near known heart disease genes. Finally, as there remains a
limited understanding of the general phenotypic impact of lost or
impaired enhancer function, we deleted two enhancers near heart
disease genes in mice. In both cases, we observed loss of target
gene expression, as well as cardiac phenotypes consistent with
heart disease in humans. Our results highlight the functional
importance of enhancers for normal heart function, as well as the
potential contribution of enhancer mutations to heart disease.
Results
Genome-wide mapping of heart enhancers. Genome-wide
profiling of enhancer-associated proteins and histone modifica-
tions such as p300/CBP or H3K27ac via chromatin immuno-
precipitation (ChIP)-seq directly applied to primary tissue is a
powerful approach for the identification of in vivo enhancers12,13.
Initial application of this technique to cardiac tissue samples
established the general utility of the method for the identification
of heart enhancers, but detected only modestly sized sets of
candidate enhancers due to limited sampling14,15. To generate a
comprehensive genome-wide catalogue of cardiac enhancers in
the human genome that can easily be incorporated into human
disease studies, we integrated epigenomic data from multiple
developmental stages and all major anatomical subregions of the
heart. In total, we examined 435 genome-wide p300/CBP and/or
H3K27ac profiles from different ex vivo cardiac tissue samples,
nearly all of which are known to be or presumed to be normal
(see Table 1 and Supplementary Table 1 for tissue information
and data sources)8,14–19. The sampled conditions include prenatal
human heart, major anatomical subregions of childhood and
adult human hearts, and a closely spaced developmental time
series
of
prenatal
and
postnatal
mouse
heart
(Table
1).
Although the inclusion of mouse samples could create bias
towards the prediction of more highly conserved enhancers
(see Supplementary Note 1), it allows for better discovery of
enhancers
active
exclusively
during
prenatal
development,
a timespan for which there is only a single human data set
considered for analysis. To enable integrative analysis across
samples and antibodies, all raw data was analysed using a uniform
processing pipeline (see the ‘Methods’ section, Supplementary
Fig. 1). Because H3K27ac and p300 are associated with both
enhancer and promoter sequences20,21, we excluded peaks
overlapping promoters, defined as those centred within 1.5 kb
of a gene transcription start site (TSS; promoters and their scores
are included separately in Supplementary Data 1 but were not
further evaluated). Peaks identified in mouse samples were
mapped to the human genome (see Supplementary Table 2).
Merging the peaks from all data sets resulted in a single list of
82,119 unique candidate heart enhancers in the human genome
(Supplementary Data 2). Nearly all (495%) of the putative
enhancers were o10 kb in size (Supplementary Fig. 2a), and most
(85%) were smaller than 5 kb. A total of 3,677 candidate enhancer
regions
410 kb
were
identified,
consistent
with
previous
observations of subsets of very long enhancers that may
form
central
nodes
of
tissue-specific
regulatory
networks
(Supplementary Note 2)22.
Two initial lines of evidence support that this catalogue is
comprised of cardiac-specific enhancers. First, gene ontology
analysis23 showed that the identified regions are highly enriched
near genes with relevant functions (Supplementary Table 3). For
example, 11 out of the 12 most enriched human phenotypes
represent cardiovascular conditions (Table 2). In addition,
152 out of 170 (89%) heart enhancers reported in the VISTA
Enhancer Browser, a large collection of in vivo enhancers
validated in transgenic mice24, are identified as candidate heart
enhancers in the present catalogue (Fig. 2a, Supplementary
Fig. 2b, Supplementary Data 2). This high rediscovery rate
highlights the sensitivity of the approach and suggests that most
known heart enhancers are recovered by the integrative analysis
in the present study.
Although p300 and H3K27ac are strong predictors of enhancer
activity, there have been recent reports of improved enhancer
prediction
using
various
additional
criteria
(for
example,
transcription factor (TF) binding and DNase hypersensitivity
(DHS))25
and/or
supervised
analysis
methods
trained
on
experimentally validated enhancer sets26,27. To assess whether
additional types of data sets or methods would substantially
improve enhancer prediction, we first performed a similar
integrative analysis using available human and mouse heart
DHS and TF data sets (data sets and their references are listed in
Supplementary Table 4). Overall, DHS and TF ChIP-seq identify
sets of loci that substantially overlap those captured by H3K27ac

 and p300 (Supplementary Fig. 3a,b). Those sites displaying DHS
or TF binding in the absence of H3K27ac or p300 are not
associated with cardiac-specific function, suggesting they do not
identify cardiac enhancers missed by our integrative H3K27ac
and p300 analysis (Supplementary Fig. 3c,d). We additionally
found that our unsupervised approach performs with an accuracy
similar to EMERGE (ref. 26) and EnhancerFinder (ref. 27),
supervised methods for enhancer prediction (Supplementary
Table 5).
Our analysis, using a large number of data sets and relatively
permissive criteria for the identification of candidate heart
enhancers, identifies a considerable proportion of the human
genome (264 Mb or B8% of the total genome) as potential
enhancers under at least one of the conditions studied. However,
individual
predicted
enhancer
sequences
vary
substantially
in the strength of the supporting evidence, which includes the
intensity of ChIP-seq signal in individual data sets (peak scores),
as well as recurrent observation of the same peak across multiple
cardiac source tissues (Fig. 2b, top). We hypothesized that
these differences provide a means to distinguish higher- from
lower-confidence predictions, allowing for rational experimental
prioritization
of
candidate
sequences.
Such
evidence-based
ranking is critical because WGS studies identify far more rare
and de novo non-coding variants than can be reasonably followed
up
experimentally6,
even
with
emerging
high-throughput
methods. We developed confidence scores to assess the support
for a putative enhancer based on two criteria: (1) the statistical
significance of the ChIP-seq enrichment observed at a locus and
(2) the number of conditions under which a putative enhancer is
observed (Methods section, Fig. 2b,c and Supplementary Data 2,
Supplementary Note 3). For each predicted enhancer sequence we
provide a combined score, on a scale from 0 (weakest evidence) to
1 (strongest evidence), reflecting the strength of evidence from all
data sets combined. Enhancer usage has previously been shown to
be temporally dynamic, with the majority of enhancers not active
throughout the entirety of development8. Therefore, we have also
provided scores from prenatal data alone and postnatal data
alone. These stage-specific scores may be more applicable for
studies, respectively, of congenital heart diseases, which typically
present around birth, and phenotypes, such as coronary artery
disease, that have adult onset.
We assessed the validity and utility of the confidence scores by
comparing the genome-wide compendium against the collection
of 42,000 experimentally tested enhancers available in the

Figure 1 | Generation and validation of a genome-wide cardiac enhancer catalogue. Integrative analysis of 435 epigenomic data sets from ex vivo
human and mouse heart tissue resulted in a catalogue of 480,000 putative human heart enhancers. We demonstrate the utility of this catalogue for the
discovery of enhancers near heart disease-associated genes by characterizing the in vivo activity patterns of 22 novel cardiovascular enhancers in
transgenic mouse assays. We also show the functional importance of enhancers by deleting two cardiac enhancers, which resulted in reduced gene
expression and impaired cardiac function.

 VISTA Enhancer Browser24. Many of the previously validated
heart enhancers were retrospectively confirmed to be among the
highest-ranking scored loci in the present study (Fig. 2d), and
validation rates correlated positively with confidence scores
(Fig. 2c, also see Supplementary Note 3, Supplementary Fig. 4,
Methods section). In total, this retrospective analysis shows that
the scoring scheme is a good indicator of the likelihood that a
putative enhancer is active in vivo.
As an example of how this cardiac compendium can be
integrated into human disease studies, we intersected it with
variants associated with a variety of heart-related phenotypes
reported in the NHGRI-EBI GWAS Catalog28. Including all
variants in strong LD with the reported lead variants (r2Z0.8),
more than 18,000 sequence variants are associated with human
heart phenotypes. Approximately 2,300 of these fall within a
predicted heart enhancer, with B900 in predicted enhancers that
have a score of at least 0.2 (ranked list and corresponding heart
enhancer scores provided in Supplementary Data 3). This
includes a variety of loci where protein-altering variants have
not been identified to explain the association signal, such as
(1) the 6q22 region near GJA1 that has been strongly implicated
in heart rate29, (2) the 1p32 region overlapping PLPP3 implicated
in coronary artery disease30 and (3) the 15q24 locus containing
HCN4 implicated in atrial fibrillation31 (Supplementary Fig. 5).
In the case of the GJA1 locus, more than 200 single-nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) fall within multiple phenotype-associated
LD blocks. Intersecting those SNPs with the heart enhancer
compendium identified 11 variants that fall within predicted
enhancers,
including
one
in
a very
high-scoring
element
(score ¼ 0.719).
This
is
a
number
that
is
tractable
to
downstream experimental validation. In the case of the HCN4
locus, the strongest scoring putative enhancer in the region
(score ¼ 0.313) includes a SNP (rs7172038) in perfect LD (r2 ¼ 1)
with the reported lead variant (rs7164883), and we included this
enhancer in the functional validation performed below. Overall,
the heart enhancer compendium can be easily intersected with
human disease data to identify strong candidates for further
experimental validation and should help prioritize enhancer
sequence variants found in human resequencing studies.
In vivo validation of heart enhancers near disease genes. Given
the large number of rare and de novo non-coding sequence
variants that are identified in WGS studies, initial analyses will
likely focus on characterizing variants in putative enhancers near
genes previously implicated in heart disease. To explore the utility
of the heart enhancer compendium for identifying in vivo
enhancers near genes of interest, we examined 58 candidate
sequences in transgenic mouse enhancer assays32,33. The selected
regions spanned the full range of combined cardiac integrative
analysis scores and were all located within 100 kb of a heart
disease-associated gene (Supplementary Data 4). In addition to
the close proximity, there is evidence from the chromatin–
chromatin spatial interaction database34 that most of the
tested sites physically interact with the putative target gene
(Supplementary Data 4). In total, 22 of the tested sequences drove
reproducible reporter gene expression in the developing heart
or blood vessels at embryonic day 11.5 (E11.5) (Fig. 3,
Supplementary Data 4 and Supplementary Table 6), including
the enhancer upstream of HCN4 that overlaps with a variant
associated with atrial fibrilation. This enhancer had strong
activity in the ventricles and weaker but reproducible activity
in the atria (Fig. 3e). Examples of additional newly identified
in vivo-validated cardiac enhancers include elements near TGFB3
(Fig. 3c) and PRKAG2 (Fig. 3d), two genes previously implicated
in heart disease35,36 but without known associated distant-acting
heart enhancers. Furthermore, we characterized new enhancers
near genes such as GATA4 (Fig. 3f, Supplementary Table 6),
where
several
in
vivo
enhancers
had
been
previously
identified15,37. The overall transgenic validation rate (38% with
cardiovascular activity) is somewhat lower than that reported by
previous heart enhancer validation efforts. This is in large part
due to our inclusion of candidate sequences from across the

analysis.

 scoring range, in contrast to previous efforts, which tended
toward validating loci with high ChIP-seq enrichment scores14,15.
However, as expected, elements that were confirmed as in vivo
cardiovascular
enhancers
had
a
higher
average
combined
confidence score than those for which no cardiovascular
activity was observed (mean combined scores: cardiovascular
positive ¼ 0.509,
cardiovascular
negative ¼ 0.385,
P ¼ 0.021,
one-tailed t-test; Supplementary Data 4). These results illustrate
the utility of the genome-wide scored data sets for identification
of in vivo cardiac enhancers near heart disease genes of interest.
Heart enhancer deletions result in cardiac dysfunction. While
in vivo reporter assay validation is a powerful tool to confirm
that an enhancer is sufficient to activate tissue-specific gene
expression, it does not illuminate whether a sequence is necessary
for proper development or health. Such information is, however,
crucial to understanding the phenotypic consequences of non-
coding mutations in the human genome. To assess the biological
necessity of heart enhancers for proper cardiac development and
function, we created knockout mouse models for two different
heart enhancers, mm77 and mm771, upstream of Myl2 and
Myh7, respectively. Mutations in either of these genes are
associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and their coding
sequences
are
routinely
screened
for
mutations
in
the
clinic4. Both enhancers fall in regions with very high combined
confidence scores (0.828 and 0.756, respectively). Furthermore,
both
drive
strong,
reproducible
reporter
gene
expression
throughout the heart at E11.5 and were initially identified from
epigenomic data sets considered in the present integrative
analysis (Fig. 4a,b, Supplementary Fig. 6). In both cases, the
human and mouse orthologous enhancer sequences drive strong
and highly reproducible reporter activity in the heart in mouse
transgenic assays, indicating functional conservation of these
enhancers in mammals (Supplementary Fig. 6).
We created two mouse lines, each carrying a deletion of one of
these two enhancers (Supplementary Fig. 7). Mice homozygous
for either enhancer deletion are born at normal Mendelian
ratios and show no gross abnormalities or overt impairments of
health (Supplementary Table 7). Adult females heterozygous or

 homozygous null for mm771 have 5–10% lower body weight than
wild-type females (Po0.05, one-tailed t-test), but no growth
phenotypes were observed for mm771 males or for mm77-null
mice of either gender (Supplementary Fig. 8).
To assess gene expression changes resulting from the loss of
either enhancer, we performed RNA sequencing on heart tissue
from E11.5 and adult mice from each enhancer deletion line.
In mice homozygous null for mm77, Myl2 RNA expression is
reduced by 75–80% compared with wild-type levels at both E11.5
and in adulthood (both Po4.9 � 10 � 19, see the ‘Methods’
section, Fig. 4c, Supplementary Fig. 9, Supplementary Data 5),
establishing that Myl2 is a direct regulatory target and that the
enhancer is required for normal expression of Myl2 in both
embryonic and adult heart. In addition to Myl2, embryonic and
adult mm77-null animals show a deficit of Ubc, a ubiquitin gene
more than 3 Mb away from the enhancer (both Po5.3 � 10 � 11).

 change in Myh6 or any other gene in cis, indicating that the
enhancer specifically controls the expression of Myh7 (Fig. 4d,
Supplementary Data 5). Myh7 is not expressed in postnatal
mouse heart38, and, consequently, no significant changes to its
expression were observed in adult Dmm771 mice (Supplementary
Fig. 10a, Supplementary Data 5). In all cases, the expression
changes observed by RNA-seq were confirmed by targeted
quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR; Fig. 4e,f,
Supplementary Figs 9c and 10b). For the affected myosin genes,
gene expression changes are dose dependent, with heterozygotes
having a reduction in myosin gene expression by B35%
compared with wild-type (mm77: P ¼ 2.7 � 10 � 5, mm771:
P ¼ 9.6 � 10 � 3, one-tailed t-test, Fig. 4e,f). We next examined
whether these mRNA expression changes result in decreased
myosin protein abundance. Western blot analysis on whole-heart
tissue established that both enhancer deletions result in B70%
reduction of cardiac protein levels (Myl2, P ¼ 2.1 � 10 � 3; Myh7,
P ¼ 1.7 � 10 � 4,
one-tailed
t-test;
Fig.
4g–j,
Supplementary
Fig. 11). Cumulatively, these results show that mm77 and
mm771 are required for normal levels of Myl2 and Myh7
protein in the heart.
To evaluate potential cardiac dysfunction resulting from the
loss of the Myl2 or Myh7 enhancer, we performed histological
and pathological analysis on both lines (Supplementary Data 6).
In heart tissue from both Dmm77 and Dmm771 mice, we
observed cases of myocardiocyte disarray and karyomegaly
(cell
nucleus
enlargement;
Fig.
5a–d).
To
quantify
these
observations, we used histological severity scores assigned by a
genotype-blind pathologist. Compared with wild-type littermates,
we
observed

rates

of

both
in
Dmm77
(P ¼ 0.02,

karyomegaly in Dmm77 (P ¼ 0.02, Fig. 5e,f, Supplementary
Fig. 12). In contrast, no reproducible histological or pathological
abnormalities were observed in any other major organ system
(Supplementary Data 6). These results support that the deleted
enhancers are important for establishing appropriate levels of
myosin gene products and for maintaining healthy cellular
morphology in the heart.
To further assess the effect of heart enhancer loss on cardiac
physiological function, we used echocardiography. Homozygous
Dmm77 (P ¼ 0.046, paired one-tailed t-test) and Dmm771
(P ¼ 0.026) mice had modest but significant decreases in
fractional shortening (Fig. 5g,h, Supplementary Fig. 13a,b), as
well as decreases in ejection fraction for Dmm771 (P ¼ 0.025,
Supplementary Fig. 13c–f). These results are consistent with
an early-stage cardiomyopathy phenotype, specifically dilated
cardiomyopathy (Supplementary Note 4, Supplementary Fig. 14).
This conclusion is further supported by adult Dmm77 mice
showing upregulation of Nppa (RNA-seq: P ¼ 8.29 � 10 � 10, see
the ‘Methods’ section ) and Nppb (RNA-seq: P ¼ 2.59 � 10 � 07)
(Supplementary Figs 9b and 15), genes whose upregulation is a
common biomarker of heart failure39. Overall, the loss of either of
the cardiac enhancers results in a large decrease of the mRNA and
protein products of a neighbouring cardiac myosin gene, which
leads to cardiac cellular abnormalities and reduced heart function.
These results illuminate a potential role for enhancer mutations
in human heart disease.
Discussion
Technological advances have enabled routine WGS for the study
of human disease. However, initial WGS analyses have focused
primarily, or exclusively, on the o2% of the genome that encodes
proteins6,40. While the strong contribution of non-coding
sequences
in
many
human
disease
traits
is
now
widely
recognized41, the skew towards coding sequence in the analysis
of WGS data persists because of a lack of annotations and
analytical tools to assess whether rare non-coding mutations are
associated with phenotypes6. In the present study, we begin to fill
this void by generating a comprehensive compendium of more
than 80,000 enhancers predicted to be active in the developing
and
adult
human
heart.
Since
these
sequences
represent
functional units with defined boundaries, this allows for the
binning of rare non-coding variants for association testing,
analogous to aggregating coding variants by gene42. To facilitate
the
prioritization
of
non-coding
regions
for
experimental
follow-up studies, each predicted enhancer is provided along
with a confidence score summarizing the strength of the
supporting
epigenomic
evidence.
While
the
present
study
focuses on a single organ system of major epidemiological
importance, the approach described here is applicable to nearly
all human organ systems. Thus, we expect that similar resources
for other phenotype-relevant tissues will serve as a critical
foundation for the analysis of genetic data from many additional
classes of human disease.
Non-coding sequence annotation is a critical first step for
interpreting whole-genome sequence data but is generally
insufficient to conclusively implicate specific mutations as causal
in disease. One powerful complementary approach is through the
use of genome engineering in animal models to formally test
the importance of a sequence change in vivo. In this study,
we illustrate how enhancers identified using genome-wide
approaches can be prioritized and assessed for normal organismal
function. Focusing on two heart enhancers located near disease-
associated genes, we show in mouse models how their loss of
function results in cardiac phenotypes. While a few enhancers
previously knocked-out in mice have the potential to result in
cardiac phenotypes (for example, refs 43,44), to our knowledge,
the Myl2 and Myh7 enhancers are the first examples whose
loss has been shown to result in a phenotype consistent with
heart disease. With the recent advances in genome editing
technology45, it appears likely that in vivo engineering approaches
will be increasingly used for large-scale modelling of both coding
and non-coding human mutations. Overall, this study highlights
the important role enhancers play in cardiac health and provides
a valuable compendium of human heart enhancers that can be
easily integrated into cardiovascular disease studies.
Methods
Chip-seq data analyses for heart enhancer prediction. Short read data of
published data sets were retrieved from the Gene Expression Omnibus46 or Human
Roadmap Epigenome website (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/roadmap/
epigenomics/). Unpublished ENCODE data was accessed through the ENCODE
Data Coordination Center website (https://www.encodeproject.org/search/).
Supplementary Table 1 lists details about each sample included in this meta-
analysis. In the case of reads stored in the Short Read Archive format47, fastq files
were obtained using the fastq-dump script available in the sratoolkit (v2.4.5).
Alignments to either the mouse (mm10) or human (hg19) reference genomes
were performed using Bowtie v0.12.7 (ref. 48). Only reads with a unique match to
the genome and showing two or fewer mismatches (-m 1 -v 2) were retained. Peak
calling was performed using MACS v1.4 (ref. 49) with the following parameters:
-gsize ¼ mm -bw ¼ 300 -nomodel -shiftsize ¼ 100. Whenever available, the
experiment-matched input DNA was used as control. When this was not available
(Supplementary Table 1), peaks were called without using an input DNA as control
with MACS v1.4 parameter -nolambda.
The resulting lists of peaks were annotated to the nearest RefSeq (ref. 50) gene
TSS in either mm10 or hg19 using HOMER51. Enriched regions with their
annotated centre within 1.5 kb from any TSS were considered promoters
(Supplementary Data 1) and separated from the putative enhancers for the scoring
described below. In case of very large regions of enrichment, the centre might
happen to lie outside the ±1.5 kb from annotated TSSs. To avoid considering
them, subtractBed (ref. 52) was used to avoid any overlapping sub-interval. mm10
v3 and hg19 v19 Basic Gencode annotations53 were downloaded from the UCSC
Genome Browser54 on 3 June and 12 July 2015, respectively. Filtering for the
TSS-proximal regions of Gencode annotated transcripts also ensured the exclusion
of potential promoters of non-coding genes from the final list.

 In some cases, multiple H3K27ac data sets were available from independent
sources for the same mouse developmental time point, and these samples were
treated as biological replicates. Biological replicates were combined using MSPC
(ref. 55), using the following parameters -r biological -s 1E-10 -W 1E-6. The
confirmed peaks were assigned the best P value, as defined by MACS, among the
overlapping peaks.
Meta-analysis and annotation of heart enhancers. The obtained lists of putative
enhancer regions for the mouse samples (mm10) were mapped to the human
genome (hg19) using liftOver54 with a requirement that Z50% of the bases in each
region map to human. Beside, each region was required to both uniquely map to
hg19, and to uniquely map back to the original region in mm10 (similar to ref. 56).
Human, as well as human-lifted mouse, regions were then merged together using
mergeBed52. The resulting regions were re-annotated to the lowest P value among
those shown by the overlapping regions; only those regions showing at least one
peak with a P value r1e-10 (as defined by MACS) in at least one condition were
considered for further analysis.
To exclude potential technical artifacts, published H3K27ac data sets from
human cell lines57 were used to produce a blacklist of regions systematically
enriched across all ChIP-seq data sets. A blacklist of human regions generated by
the ENCODE Consortium itself was also used57 (https://sites.google.com/site/
anshulkundaje/projects/blacklists).
Gene ontology enrichment was performed for the complete list of putative heart
enhancers using GREAT23.
The positions of the resulting regions were annotated relative to the TSS of:
(1) the nearest gene; (2) the nearest gene showing one or more heart-related
phenotypes in the Mouse Genome Database58; and (3) the nearest gene annotated
with a heart-related phenotype in the Human-Phenotype Ontology59. These
annotations were performed using a custom script and lists of RefSeq genes
downloaded from the UCSC Genome Browser 4 May 2015. The manually curated
lists of heart-related terms are included in Supplementary Data 7. The putative
enhancer regions were also annotated to variants significantly associated to human
phenotypic traits—as listed in the GWAS catalogue28. Bedmap from the BEDOPS
suite60 was used to perform this annotation step.
Scoring scheme for putative heart enhancers. Given one condition
(for example, E11.5 mouse H3K27ac), for each given putative enhancer region r
and its MACS-generated P value p, the following score S was calculated:
S r; p
ð
Þ ¼ � log10
number of enhancer regions with a P value � p
total number of enhancer regions
�
�
Each score represents the probability of observing an equal or better ChIP-seq
enrichment (that is, an equal or lower P value), under a specific condition. For each
region, the scores were summed up either across all conditions (to obtain the final
combined score) or only across foetal or postnatal conditions (to get the pre- and
postnatal scores, respectively). Scores were normalized on a scale of 0.0–1.0 such
that the highest scoring enhancer in each score class (combined, prenatal and
postnatal) was set to 1.0.
Intersecting enhancer predictions with VISTA. Regions experimentally tested
for in vivo enhancer activity in mouse transgenic assays were downloaded from the
VISTA enhancer browser (http://enhancer.lbl.gov/)24 on 24 September 2015. Only
VISTA elements that could be mapped to hg19 were considered, and those that
overlapped promoters or blacklisted sequences (as defined in the meta-analysis
section above) were excluded. The overlap among VISTA elements and the
putative heart enhancers resulting from the meta-analysis was assessed using
coverageBed52. Only regions and VISTA elements intersecting at least 500 bps were
considered for further analyses. The overlapping VISTA elements (both positive
and negative for enhancer activity) were then ranked based on the score, and a
cubic spline (df ¼ 3) was fit using the splineFit function available in R. This way,
a curve estimating the value of in vivo validation rate across the whole spectrum of
scores over the validated elements was obtained. These values were then used to
extrapolate the curve that directly relates the in vivo validation rate to the score of
all regions in the meta-analysis. This procedure was repeated separately for each of
the three scores.
Comparison with other enhancer prediction methods. We compared our
unsupervised enhancer prediction against two previously reported methods,
EnhancerFinder27 and EMERGE26. Unless otherwise noted (Supplementary
Table 5), area under the curve for receiver operating characteristic curves for
EnhancerFinder and EMERGE results are those reported in the corresponding
papers for the prediction of mammalian heart enhancers. All other area under the
curve values were generated as described in the EMERGE paper26.
Intersecting heart enhancer compendium with GWAS catalogue. We retrieved
all phenotype-associated SNPs in the NHGRI-EBI GWAS catalogue28 implicated in
heart-related traits (search term ‘heart’). The SNP Annotation and Proxy Search
(SNAP)61 tool was used to identify all SNPs in strong LD using the following
parameters: 1,000 Genomes Pilot 1 data set, r2Z0.8, the Northern Europeans from
Utah (CEU) population panel, 500 kb distance limit.
Transgenic mouse assays. Enhancer and allelic variant names (mm and hs
numbers) used in this study are the unique identifiers used in the VISTA Enhancer
Browser (http://enhancer.lbl.gov/). Enhancer sequences were amplified from
human (hs numbers) or mouse (mm numbers) genomic DNA and cloned into an
hsp68-lacZ expression vector as previously described33. Genome coordinates
and primer sequences for all elements are listed in Supplementary Data 4 and
Supplementary Table 8. Transgenic mouse assays were performed as previously
described32,33, and results for mm77 (ref. 15) and the human ortholog of mm771
(hs1670)62,63 were previously reported. To determine if tested enhancers physically
contact the putative target genes, we queried all available human and mouse data
sets in the chromatin–chromatin spatial interaction database34. To avoid
considering interactions that could have been annotated just due to physical
proximity, enhancer-promoter pairs closer than 10 kb were not annotated
(indicated as ‘Close’ in Supplementary Data 4).
Generation of enhancer knockout mice. Enhancer null lines were generated via
homologous recombination (Supplementary Fig. 7a) as previously described62.
Primer sequences used for generating, validating (Supplementary Fig. 7b,c)
and genotyping (Supplementary Fig. 7d,e) targeted ES cell lines and mice
are listed in Supplementary Table 9. The mm771 deletion removed 332 bp
(mm10 chr14:54,996,893–54,997,224) and the mm77 deletion removed 2,517 bp
(mm10 chr5:122,092,252–122,094,768) of non-coding sequence.
Gene expression analysis for enhancer knockouts. RNA was isolated from
whole hearts microdissected from multiple litters of embryonic mice using the
Ambion RNAqueous Total RNA Isolation Kit (Life Technologies) according to
manufacturer instructions. Matched genomic DNA was collected for each embryo
from limb or tail tissue as previously described62. Each embryo’s enhancer
genotype was assessed using the mm77 or mm771 genotyping primers listed in
Supplementary Table 9. For adult mice, RNA was extracted from the ventricular
portion of the heart using physical homogenization and the TRIzol Reagent
(Life Technologies).
For RNA-seq, RNA samples were DNase-treated with the TURBO DNA-free
Kit (Life Technologies), and RNA quality was then assessed using a 2100
Bioanalyzer (Agilent) with an RNA 6,000 Nano Kit (Agilent). RNA sequencing
libraries were made using the TruSeq Stranded Total RNA with Ribo-Zero
Human/Mouse/Rat kit (Illumina) or the TruSeq Stranded mRNA Sample Prep
Kit (Illumina) according to manufacturer instructions. RNA-seq libraries were
subjected to an additional purification to remove remaining high molecular weight
products as follows: sample volume was increased to 100 ml by addition of 1X TE
buffer or Illumina Resuspension Buffer and then incubated with 60 ml Agencourt
AMPure XP beads for 4 min. The beads were pelleted by incubation on a magnet,
and the entire supernatant was transferred to a tube containing 50 ml of fresh
AMPure XP beads and incubated for 4 min. After pelleting the new beads with a
magnet, the supernatant was discarded, the beads washed twice with 80% ethanol
and the DNA was eluted in 30 ml Illumina Resuspension buffer. The resulting
RNAseq libraries were diluted 10 � and their quality and concentration were
assessed using a 2100 Bioanalyzer with the High Sensitivity DNA Kit (Agilent) and
a Qubit Fluorometer with the Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Life Technologies).
RNAseq libraries were pooled four libraries per lane and sequenced via single end
50 bp reads on a HiSeq 2000 (Illumina).
RNA-seq data was analysed as follows: CASAVA v1.8.0 (Illumina) was used to
demultiplex data, and reads with CASAVA ‘Y’ flag (purity filtering) were discarded.
After quality filtering and adaptor trimming using cutadapt_v1.1 (ref. 64) with
parameter ‘-m 25 -q 25’, between 37 and 54 million reads were obtained for each
sample. Mouse genome sequence (mm9) and gene annotation were retrieved from
the iGenomes repository (https://support.illumina.com/sequencing/sequencing_
software/igenome.html). Tophat v2.0.6 (ref. 65) was used to align the reads to the
mouse reference genome and transcriptome, then reads mapping to UCSC known
genes were counted by HTSeq (ref. 66). Differential gene expression analysis
between wild type and knockout for mm77 or mm771 enhancers was performed
using edgeR (ref. 67), and genes whose expression was extremely low in all samples
(fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads (FPKM)o1,
calculated by Cufflinks v2.2.1 (ref. 68)) were discarded for further analysis. P values
for all RNA-seq experiments are those reported by edgeR after false discovery rate
(FDR) correction (FDRo5%).
For quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR) measuring Myl2, Myh7 and Ubc, RNA was
reverse transcribed using SuperScript III (Life Technologies) with random hexamer
or poly-dT priming according to manufacturer instructions. For qPCR measuring
Nppa and Nppb, RNA was first treated with RNase-free DNase (Promega) and then
reverse transcribed using SuperScript III with poly-dT priming. qPCR was
performed on a LightCycler 480 (Roche) using TaqMan-style reactions containing
Master Mix (LightCycler 480 Probes Master Mix (Roche) or Probe Fast Universal
qPCR Master Mix (Kapa Biosystems)), PrimeTime qPCR Assay primer/probe mix
(Integrated DNA Technologies) for the test gene, primer/probe mix to the actin
control gene, 0.5–1 ml of the reverse transcriptase reaction and RNAase-free water.

 qPCR assays were performed in triplicate for each sample, and genomic DNA
amplification was excluded for all samples by a lack of substantial amplification in
reverse transcriptase-negative qPCR reactions or by the absence of a genomic DNA
amplification band when reverse transcriptase-positive reactions were run on an
agarose gel. PrimeTime qPCR Assay primer/probe mixes used for qPCR assays are
provided in Supplementary Table 10. Reactions were analysed as previously
described69, using actin as the reference gene.
Protein expression analysis for enhancer knockouts. Myosin was extracted
from individual embryonic or adult mouse whole hearts as previously described70
with minor modifications. Protein was quantified by Bradford Assay. Proteins were
separated on 8–16% gradient Tris-glycine gels by electrophoresis and transferred to
polyvinylidene difluoride membranes using standard western blotting procedures.
Membranes were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin, incubated with primary
antibodies overnight, washed, incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 h, washed
and imaged using a VersaDoc Molecular Imager (Bio-Rad). Antibody details are
provided in Supplementary Table 11. Quantification of band intensities was carried
out using the gel analyzer feature of ImageJ (ref. 71), with GAPDH serving as a
loading control. Uncropped western blot images are provided in Supplementary
Fig. 11.
Echocardiography, necropsy, pathology and histology. Echocardiography was
performed by the University of California Davis Mouse Metabolic Phenotyping
Center’s Cardiovascular Biology and Pathology Core. Echocardiograms were
performed on conscious animals to assess the systolic function using M-mode
and two-dimensional measurements as previously described72.
Gross necropsy, histology and pathology were performed by the University of
California Davis Comparative Pathology Lab using standard techniques. Briefly,
animals were euthanized by carbon dioxide asphyxiation. Organs were collected,
weighed and fixed with paraformaldehyde. Tissues were paraffin embedded, and
5 mm sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin for pathological
evaluation.
Cardiac histology sections were assessed by a trained veterinary pathologist,
who was blinded to genotype status. The severity of left ventricular hypertrophy,
myocardiocyte disarray, myocardiocyte karyomegaly and interstitial fibrosis
present in each heart sample were scored as follows:
0 ¼ not observed
1 ¼ minimal (1–2 foci or o10% of heart involved)
2 ¼ mild (3–6 foci or 10–40% of heart involved)
3 ¼ moderate (6–10 foci or 40–60% of heart involved)
4 ¼ severe (10 þ foci or 460% of heart involved)
Animal approval and experimental design. All animal work was reviewed and
approved by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory Animal Welfare and
Research Committee or the University of California, Davis Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee.
R was used to compute the statistics and to generate plots for this work.
Transgenic mouse assays. Transgenic assays were performed in Mus musculus
FVB strain mice. Sample sizes were selected empirically based on our previous
experience of performing transgenic mouse assays for 42,000 total putative
enhancers (for example, refs 12,14,15,33,62). Mouse embryos were only excluded
from further analysis if they did not carry the reporter transgene or if they were not
at the correct developmental stage. As all transgenic mice were treated with
identical experimental conditions, and as there were no groups of animals directly
compared in this section of the study, randomization and experimenter blinding
were unnecessary and not performed.
Enhancer knockouts. Enhancers were deleted in Mus musculus W4 (129S6
strain) mouse embryonic stem cells (Taconic). Resulting mice were crossed into the
C57BL/6J strain. All mice and mouse embryos described in the enhancer knockout
section of this paper resulted from heterozygous x heterozygous crosses to allow for
the comparison of matched littermates of different genotypes. With the exception
of qPCR experiments (where entire litters were analysed) and the RNA-seq
performed on adult mm77 mice (where sufficient matched littermates were not
available), all experiments employed a matched littermate selection strategy. For
every homozygous null animal selected, a homozygous wild-type animal from the
same litter was selected for comparison. For all postnatal mice, littermate pairs
were selected to have matching genders. Embryonic samples used for qPCR,
RNA-seq and western blotting were dissected blind to genotype.
The underlying hypothesis of the enhancer knockout section was that loss of
either cardiac enhancer would decrease neighbouring myosin gene and protein
levels. Based on the Myl2 gene-null phenotype previously observed in humans and
mice (see Supplementary Note 4), we expected this decrease in gene expression to
result in reduced cardiac function and possibly mild cardiac hypertrophy in
homozygous null mice relative to matched wild-type littermates. Therefore,
statistical significance of results was assessed by one-tailed t-test or Wilcoxon
rank-sum test for metrics such as gene/protein expression, heart weight/body
weight ratios, left ventricular mass and cardiac function (ejection fraction and
fractional shortening) comparisons. Remaining metrics were assessed using
two-tailed tests. Because of the matched littermate selection scheme used, paired
tests were used to assess significance of echocardiography and pathology results.
qPCR. Embryonic samples were collected from at least two independent litters
for each line. Embryos were excluded from any further analysis if they were in the
process of being resorbed, not at the correct developmental stage, or insufficient
quantities of RNA were isolated from them. Otherwise, all embryonic samples
collected for each qPCR experiment were analysed. Adult samples for qPCR
validation of Nppa, Nppb and Ubc were technical replicates of those used for
RNA-seq.
RNA-seq. Samples were chosen for RNA-seq based on RNA sample quantity and
quality, and the availability of matched littermate pairs. To avoid batch effects,
RNA-seq libraries from all samples within the same experiment were made in the
same batch. Libraries were pooled together such that matched littermate pairs were
run on the same flow cell lane.
Western blots. One potential homozygous null mm77 animal was excluded from
analysis due to inconclusive genotyping results, resulting in one unmatched
wild-type sample in this analysis. To avoid batch effects, homozygous null and
homozygous wild-type samples were alternated for protein extraction, and all
samples within an experiment were run on the same gel and blot.
Echocardiography, Histology and Pathology: to control for any physiological
effects due to strain background, age or gender, littermate pairs were selected for
further phenotyping such that one mouse in each pair was homozygous wild-type
and one mouse was homozygous null and both mice in each pair were the same
gender. To minimize physiological effects due to body weight, littermate pairs
were selected to minimize differences in body weights between paired samples.
Detailed information (age, sex, body mass and so on) about mice selected
for this phenotyping is provided in Supplementary Data 6. All echocardiography,
necropsy, pathology and histology assays were performed blinded to genotype,
and mice were randomized for echocardiography. Sample sizes were selected for
echocardiography based on similar previously reported studies73. Left ventricular
mass could not be ascertained by echocardiography for one mouse homozygous
null for the mm771 enhancer.
