Increased Service Use Among
Children With Autism Spectrum
Disorder Associated With Mental
Health Parity Law
ABSTRACT Health care services for children with autism spectrum disorder
are often expensive and frequently not covered under private health
insurance. The 2008 Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health
Parity and Addiction Equity Act was viewed as a possible means of
improving access by eliminating differences between behavioral health
and medical/surgical benefits. We examined whether the legislation was
associated with increased use of and spending on mental health care and
functional services for children with autism spectrum disorder compared
to the period prior to implementation of the law. We used nationwide
health insurance commercial group claims data to examine trends in
service use and spending among children with autism spectrum disorder
before and after implementation of the law. For such children,
implementation was associated with increased use of both mental health
and non–mental health services. These increases in use were not
associated with higher out-of-pocket spending, which suggests that the
law improved financial protection for families.
T

Paul

and

Domenici Mental Health Parity
and Addiction Equity Act of 2008
went into effect in 2010. The legis-
lation aimed to eliminate the long-
standing differences in the generosity of private
health insurance coverage for mental health and
substance use disorder services relative to other
medical care services. Before the law, insurance
coverage for mental health and substance use
disorder servicesoftenrequiredhighercost shar-
ing (forexample,coinsurance of 50 percentcom-
pared with 20 percent for outpatient medical
services) and placed limits on special services
(for example, twenty outpatient visits and thirty
inpatient days per year).1 The parity law requires
group commercial insurance policies offering
mental health and substance use disorder bene-
fits to ensure that all financial requirements (de-
ductibles, copayments, and coinsurance) and
treatment limits (number of inpatient days and
outpatient visits) for mental health and sub-
stance use disorder benefits are at least as gen-
erous as those for medical/surgical benefits, and
it prohibits the use of special annual and lifetime
dollar limits on mental health and substance use
disorder services. It also requires, under the final
regulations,2
equivalence
in
so-called
non-
quantitative treatment limitations such as prior
authorization andother utilizationmanagement
requirements,
medical
necessity
determina-
tions, and network adequacy standards.
A controversial provision of the law relates to
which diagnoses it covers. The law does not re-
quire that specific conditions be covered; rather,
it specifies that services are covered for mental
health and substance use disorders as defined
“under the terms of a health plan.” It is left to the
discretion of the insurer to decide to which diag-
noses the parity law applies.3 An important un-

 answered question is whether the federal parity
law was associated with changes in services pro-
vided under private insurance for children with
autism spectrum disorder (ASD).
ASD is a neurobehavioral syndrome that is
defined by the presence of repetitive and stereo-
typic behaviors and disruption in the develop-
ment of social and language abilities.4 Over the
past several decades, prevalence estimates of
ASD have risen precipitously. In the 1980s
ASD was believed to occur in 5 of every 10,000
children (0.05 percent).5,6 Today ASD is estimat-
ed to affect 1 in 68 children (1.5 percent).5,6
People with ASD require chronic management
throughout their lifespan. Services include be-
havioral, speech and language, occupational,
and physical therapies to treat a range of behav-
ioral, language, sensory, and adaptive deficits
intrinsic to the disorder.7 Health care costs for
children with ASD can be substantial8–10 because
of the considerable need for these services, and
families of children with ASD consistently report
challenges paying for services.11–13
Historically, commercial health insurance has
excluded or provided minimal coverage for the
treatment of ASD.14 In most cases, these treat-
ments, whether covered or not, involve tradi-
tional outpatient mental health services (for ex-
ample, pharmacology and psychotherapy) since
most children with ASD suffer from a co-occur-
ring psychiatric disorder.15,16 Behavioral thera-
pies specific to the treatment of ASD, such as
applied behavioral analysis, are often also rec-
ommended to treat behavioral challenges. Be-
havioral health services to treat children with
ASD may be delivered for forty hours per week
(or more) for several years.17 The intensity of
services often recommended for behavioral ther-
apies typically farexceeds the level that tradition-
ally most policies covered17 for mental health
services.
Advocates for children with ASD viewed the
passage of the federal parity law as an opportu-
nity to expand access to mental health services to
this population and to lower the out-of-pocket
financialburdenon families. Anincrease in men-
tal health services could also increase the use of
functional services (such as speech and language
services and occupational or physical therapy)
and total health care spending because of in-
creased contacts and referrals. However, the pro-
vision that gives insurers discretion over which
diagnoses are covered could also result in a min-
imal or no change in service use and spending for
children with ASD. If the law leads some employ-
ers to drop coverage of ASD, a decrease in service
use and spending could be observed. For exam-
ple, a recent study found that litigation chal-
lenges to federal parity involved multiple cases
in which denials of services to treat ASD were at
issue, which suggests that controversy exists
around application of the law to ASD.18
Only one prior study has examined the rela-
tionship between insurance parity and access to
care or financial protection among children with
ASD; that study focused on earlier state parity
laws.19 Using data from the 2005–06 wave of the
National Survey of Children with Special Health
Care Needs, Lucy Bilaver and Neil Jordan exam-
ined the effects of state mental health parity laws
on family financial burden, satisfaction with
health insurance, and receipt of mental health
services for privately insured children and did
not find state parity laws to be associated with
improved outcomes.19 However, that study was
based on a retrospective report and may have
been subject to recall bias. That study also could
not distinguish which children were enrolled in
commercial
health
insurance
through
self-
insured firms versus fully insured firms. This
is a critical limitation in estimating the effects
of state parity laws since only people with com-
mercial insurance through fully insured firms in
states with parity laws were actually subject to
those laws, as a result of the Employee Retire-
ment Income Security Act (ERISA) of 1974.
ERISA exempts self-insured firms—those con-
tracting with health plans to administer employ-
ee health benefits only and not to manage their
insurance risk pool—from state insurance regu-
lations. About half of all commercially insured
people are enrolled through self-insured firms
that are exempt from state mandates.3,20
In this study we used an interrupted time se-
ries research design to examine whether federal
parity was associated with changes in the proba-
bility of using mental health services, the inten-
sity of services used, and spending on mental
health services among children with ASD paid
for by private insurance. In addition, we assessed
whether the law had secondary associations
through changes in use of functional therapies
including speech and language therapies and
occupational and physical therapy services,
and whether the law was associated with a
change in total health care spending among chil-
dren with ASD.
Study Data And Methods
Data And Sample We used the Truven Health
MarketScan Research Database from the period
2007–12. The MarketScan database includes
health insurance claims and encounters for em-
ployees and their dependents from approximate-
ly 100 large employers and health plans in the
United States, which cover approximately fifteen
to twenty-two million enrollees per year. Nearly

 all of these employers self-insure and thus are
not subject to state insurance mandates. The
data include inpatient, outpatient, and pharma-
cy claims with information on diagnoses, proce-
dures, and payments.
The study population consisted of all enrolled
children ages 0–18 with at least two inpatient or
outpatient claims with a primary diagnosis
of autism (International Classification of Dis-
eases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification
[ICD-9-CM], code 299.xx) anytime during the
six-year study period from 2007 through 2012
(N ¼ 38,928); this approach to identification of
ASD was validated by James Burke and col-
leagues.21 A child’s data for a given year were
used if the child was enrolled continuously dur-
ing all twelve months of the year. Because of the
many differences in the types of services used
across children’s ages, we did not require con-
tinuous enrollment throughout the entire six-
year study period, as this would have resulted
in the same sample being included in every cal-
endar year, leading to a cohort that aged six years
over the study period, as well as a much smaller
sample overall. Sensitivity analyses considered
whether effects differed for younger (ages 0–12)
versus older (ages 13–18) children as well as for
the subsample of children with at least two pri-
mary diagnoses of autistic disorder (ICD-9-CM
code 299.00) during the study period; see the
online Appendix.22 To ensure that we had all
information on mental health service use, we
omitted plans that carved out mental health
benefits.
Outcomes We examined use of mental health
care, speech and language therapy, and occupa-
tional or physical therapy within four categories
of outcomes: any service use, the quantity of
services used among service users, total spend-
ing (insurer plus out of pocket) among service
users, and out-of-pocket spending among ser-
vice users. We also examined total health care
spending (all inpatient, outpatient, and pharma-
ceutical spending for all medical, mental health,
and pharmaceutical care) for children with ASD.
The use of inpatient or outpatient mental health
services and psychotropic medications was iden-
tified
using
well-established
algorithms23–25
based on ICD-9 diagnostic codes 295–309 (ex-
cept for codes 303, 304, and 305) and 311–314
and mental health–specific procedure codes. In-
patient hospitalizations were identified as men-
tal health–related if 50 percent or more of the
claims associated with that hospitalization had a
primary mental health diagnostic or procedure
code and a primary discharge diagnosis of men-
tal illness. Outpatient speech and language ser-
vices were identified based on the following pro-
cedure codes: 92506–8, 92526, G0153, S9128,
S9152, and T1013. Outpatient occupational or
physical therapy services were identified based
on the following procedure codes: 97001–4,
97039,
97100,
97110,
97112,
97113,
97116,
97140, 97533, 97760, 98960, 99091, G0151,
G0152, G0283, H2033, S8990, S9129, and
S9131. Given that providers might not always
be precise about the exact billing codes used,
wealso considereda combinedoutcome formen-
tal health, speech and language, and occupation-
al or physical therapy. Outcomes examining the
quantities of specific services used were mea-
sured among the subset of children using a spe-
cific service in a given calendar year. Spending
outcomes are reported in real 2012 dollars. Note
that the use of insurance claims data meant that
out-of-pocket spending included only copay-
ments and deductibles associated with claims
processed through the insurance system and
did not includeexpensesassociated with services
that were entirely self-paid.
Statistical Approach To evaluate how the
federal parity law was related to outcomes, we
used an interrupted time series model to com-
pare trends observed in the post-parity time pe-
riod with what would have been expected given
trends observed before parity. The model includ-
ed a linear monthly time variable, a parity indi-
cator (0 from 2007 to 2009 and 1 from 2010 to
2012), the interaction between time and parity,
and eleven binary variables for the calendar
months. (The calendar month variables were in-
cluded to account for seasonality, in particular
because of deductibles that restart in January of
each calendar year.) The parameters of interest
are the coefficient on parity, which captures any
change in the outcome that happened at the time
of parity implementation, and the coefficient on
the time by parity interaction, which reflects any
change in the time trend as a result of parity. A
statistically significant coefficient on either or

 both of these terms is indicative of an association
between the parity law and the outcome.We also
present summary measures regarding the asso-
ciations between the federal parity law and ser-
vice use and spending outcomes during the first
year following implementation. See the work of
Anthony Biglan and colleagues or the work by
Anita Wagner and colleagues for details on these
models.26,27
The models were fitted with seventy-two
monthly observations, aggregated across indi-
viduals; thus, no individual-level covariates were
included. Variances were calculated using Yule-
Walker first-order autoregressive parameters to
control for correlation between consecutive
months, fitted using the SAS autoreg com-
mand.28 The model specification was chosen
based on the Akaike information criterion,29 al-
though results were similar across models that
included other predictor sets, including a model
with no month indicators and another with only
those monthly indicators that were statistically
significant.
Limitations This study had a number of lim-
itations. First, our analysis lacked a comparison
group not affected by the parity law; identifying
such a group would be challenging for national
policy changes such as the parity law. This means
that the results could be sensitive to other
changes or unmeasured factors that might have
affected service use and spending (unrelated to
parity) occurring at the same point in time. For
example, from 2008 to 2010 eighteen states
enacted state autism insurance mandates that
aimed to increase coverage of autism services
among the commercially insured population.
In practice, however, these laws would not be
expected to affect enrollees in the Truven Mar-
ketScan data, which, as noted above, comprise
employees and dependents of large firms that
self-insure; state autism mandates apply only
to enrollees of firms that are fully insured as a
result of ERISA. And a recent published study of
the effects of state autism mandate laws sug-
gested little change in access to autism treatment
services among self-insured enrollees in states
with autism mandate laws, which suggests that
spillover effects are not a major concern.30
Related to this, many states enacted their own,
typically narrower, parity laws in the years prior
to passage of the federal parity law. Similar to
state autism mandates, these state parity laws
applied only to enrollees of firms that were fully
insured. These enrollees were not included in
these Truven data, thereby minimizing our con-
cern about spillover. And very few state parity
laws applied to children with ASD. However, in
practice, if any spillover is occurring, the com-
bined effects of both the federal and state parity
laws are perhaps most relevant to understanding
how this specific policy lever affects relevant out-
comes among children with ASD.
Second, the MarketScan data capture plans
with disproportionately generous coverage and
thus might not be representative of all employer-
sponsored plans. Third, while state indicators
are available in the MarketScan data, our analy-
sis was aggregated to the month level, prohibit-
ing us from controlling for state-level character-
istics. Fourth, we did not have details on specific
benefits offered within enrollees’ health plans,
to understand which services were covered and
at what levels and how benefits changed before
and after the parity law. Fifth, children with ASD
receive many services in school,31,32 and parents
have traditionally paid for much of ASD care on a
self-pay basis. We did not capture any services
received in school settings or any paid complete-
ly for out of pocket; therefore, we could not ob-
serve how the changes we identified in commer-
cial coveragewereconnected to changes inuse or
spending in the school sectors or to family finan-
cial burden outside of insurance.
Offsetting strengths of this study include the
very large sample size, inclusion of all claims
paid for through private insurance, and exami-
nation of a variety of important outcomes.
Study Results
Unadjusted demographic and clinical character-
istics of the full sample with autism spectrum
disorder diagnoses at the child-year level are pre-
sented in Exhibit 1. Across study years, only
about 18 percent of children in each year were
female, and about 33 percent were between
ages 12 and 18. In each year, approximately
two-thirds of the children had a comorbidmental
health diagnosis, the most common of which was
conduct disorder/oppositional defiant disorder.
There was a slight increase over time in the
treated prevalence of ASD, measured as the share
of enrollees ages 0–18 with a primary diagnosis
of ASD on a service claim, from 0.30 percent in
2007–09 to 0.40 percent in 2010–12.
Exhibit 1 also presents descriptive information
on service use paid for through private insurance
by calendar year. In a given year, approximately
two-thirds of the sample used outpatient mental
health services, while only about 2 percent used
inpatient mental health services. Use of out-
patient psychotherapy services was more com-
mon than use of outpatient psychotropic medi-
cation management services. Fewer children
with ASD used functional therapies in a given
year, with only 8.8–11.3 percent using speech
and language therapy and 5.4–6.3 percent using
occupational or physical therapy during the

appear in multiple years. Each cell represents the average of three years of annual data. aTreated prevalence of autism is defined as the proportion of child enrollees
ages 0–18 with at least one claim with an ASD diagnosis. bChildren with an ASD diagnosis in the sample could have multiple comorbid mental health diagnoses. cTotal
spending includes both the health insurer and the family out-of-pocket payment for services paid for through insurance. dHealth care spending among families for their
children with ASD includes all types of services paid for by insurance including medical care, mental health care, functional therapies, and prescription drugs. eMental
health care spending among families for their children with ASD includes inpatient mental health care, outpatient mental health services, and psychotropic drug use.

 federal parity law and use of services among chil-
dren with ASD. There were generally no statisti-
cally significant increases in service use at the
time of the law’s implementation, but there were
increases in the trends in service use over time
attributable to the law. For example, while the
probability of mental health service use among
children with ASD did not increase at the time of
the law’s implementation (p ¼ 0:75; 95% confi-
dence interval: −0.0078, 0.0056), the rate of
change in the use of mental health services over
time did increase after parity (p < 0:001; 95%
CI: 0.0010, 0.0017). A similar pattern was seen
for speech and language therapies (p for trend
< 0:001; 95% CI: 0.0005, 0.0008) and occupa-
tional and physical therapies (p for trend
< 0.001; 95% CI: 0.0003, 0.0004). Conditional
on use of specific types of services, the quantity
of services in most categories used by children
with ASD also increased after parity (Exhibit 2).
Specifically, among children with ASD using out-
patient mental health services, there was a small
but significant increase in the number of visits
per month (p ¼ 0:05; 95% CI: −0.0002, 0.1012)
both at the time of parity implementation and as
an increase in the trend in the number of out-
patient
mental
health
visits
per
month
(p < 0:001; 95% CI: 0.0110, 0.0156) after parity.
A similar pattern was seen among children with
ASD using speech and language (p < 0:001;
95% CI: 0.0084, 0.0172) and occupational and
physical therapies (p < 0:001; 95% CI: 0.0076,
0.0137). For example, over the first year follow-
ing parity, this translated into 1.6 additional
mental health visits per user of mental health
services, 0.4 additional speech and language
therapy visits per user of speech and language
therapy, and 0.7 additional occupational and
physical therapy visits per user of occupational
and physical therapies. These results are summa-
rized in Exhibit 3, which shows the increase in
mental health, speech and language, and occu-
pational and physical therapy visits associated
with the federal parity law’s implementation.
Exhibit 4 shows the associations between the
federal parity law and total and out-of-pocket
spending. For all total spending outcomes, we
found no evidence of a jump in spending at the
time of parity implementation. However, we
found small but significant increases in the
post-parity trends for total health care spending
and each of the components examined. During
the first year following implementation of the
parity law, for example, this corresponds to an
average increase in total spending of $73 per
child. As indicated by the lower panel of Exhib-
it 4, the increase in total spending was not ac-
companied by an increase in out-of-pocket
spending by families. We found no significant
associations between the federal parity law and
out-of-pocket spending, with one exception: a
slight increase in the trend in out-of-pocket
spending on occupational and physical therapy
services (p < 0:001; 95% CI: 0.0165, 0.0382).
There is evidence that the associations ob-
served are concentrated in children ages 0–12

 (compared to those ages 13–18). Full results are
presented in the Appendix;22 in brief, the parity
law was associated with 4.6 additional mental
health or functional therapy (speech and lan-
guage therapy or occupational or physical thera-
py) visits per child ages 0–12 years using those
services during the first year following imple-
mentation. Sensitivity analyses restricting atten-
tion to youth with two diagnoses of ASD found
results nearly identical to those presented here;
full results are in the Appendix.22
Discussion
The federal parity law was associated with in-
creases in the probability that children with au-
tism spectrum disorder would receive mental
health and functional therapies, and increases
in the quantity of these services used. The law’s
implementation was also associated with in-
creases in spending for mental health services
and functional therapies. However, the law was
not associated with significant changes in out-of-
pocket spending among families of children with
ASD except for a slight increase in out-of-pocket
spending for occupational or physical therapy
services. These differences in findings between
outcomes reduce the likelihood that our findings
were attributable to a general secular increase in
autism treatment under commercial insurance;
if that was the case, we would have expected to
see an accompanying increase in family out-of-
pocketspending. The fact thatwe did notobserve
such an increase suggests that the federal parity
law might have conferred financial protection to
families seeking to avail themselves of treat-
ments now covered more generously under the
law—a central intent of its architects.
Changes in outcomes associated with the fed-
eral parity law were larger in magnitude among
younger children with ASD than older children.
This finding makes sense for a few reasons. First,
as children move into school settings, schools
tend to provide more services that might have
been paid by commercial insurance prior to the
school years. Second, as children age, they have
less time for intensive treatment because of the
increasing demands of school and other activi-
ties. And finally, many providers only work with
younger children with ASD, so even among chil-
dren with private insurance coverage, it becomes
increasingly difficult to find providers as chil-
dren age.
Our findings regarding the federal parity law
differ substantially from prior work indicating
no effects of state parity laws on access to ser-
vices or financial protection for children with
ASD.19 The results also differ from some previous
work showing limited effects of state autism
mandates on out-of-pocket expenses and finan-
cial burden among families of children with ASD.
However, both Bilaver and Jordan19 and Pinka
Chatterji and colleagues33 used data from the
National Survey of Children with Special Health
Care Needs and relied on families’ self-reporting
of out-of-pocket expenditures, which might have
been subject to recall bias. In addition, these data
did not allow researchers to determine whether a
child was enrolledin an insurance plan subject to
the mandate. Typically, only about half of pri-
vately insured individuals would have been af-
fected20 because ERISA exempts self-insured
firms—those that contract with health plans only
to administer employee health benefits and not
to pool risk—from state insurance regulations.
Conclusion
This study provides evidence that the federal
parity law was associated with greater use of
services paid for through insurance for children
with ASD without driving up the out-of-pocket
spending paid by families through their insur-
ance policies. However, the higher rates of use
after the implementation of the law are still well
below what one might expect in the context of
increasing levels of impairment and service
needs over the past few years, with the most
recent Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
tion estimate of the community prevalence of
ASD now at 15 per 1,000 children. Monitoring
and enforcement of the federal parity law has
been a persistent concern.34 Our findings sug-
gest that more stringent parity enforcement,
additional policy approaches, or both, might
be needed to ensure that children with ASD
are connected to evidence-based services and
supports. ▪
