Abstract 
Background: The prevalence of food hypersensitivity in the UK is still largely open to debate. Additionally its patho-
genesis is also unclear although it is known that there are differing phenotypes. Determining its prevalence, along 
with identifying those factors associated with its development will help to assess its clinical importance within the 
national setting and also add to the debate on appropriate prevention strategies.
Methods: A population based birth cohort study conducted in Hampshire, UK as part of the EuroPrevall birth cohort 
study. 1140 infants were recruited with 823 being followed up until 2 years of age. Infants with suspected food reac-
tions were assessed including specific IgE measurement and skin prick testing. Diagnosis of food hypersensitivity was 
by positive double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC) where symptoms up to 48 h after the end of 
the food challenge were considered indicative of a food hypersensitivity. Factors associated with food hypersensitiv-
ity and its two phenotypes of IgE-mediated and non-IgE-mediated disease were modelled in a multivariable logistic 
regression analysis.
Results: Cumulative incidence of food hypersensitivity by 2 years of age was 5.0 %. The cumulative incidence for 
individual food allergens were hens’ egg 2.7 % (1.6–3.8); cows’ milk 2.4 % (1.4–3.5); peanut 0.7 % (0.1–1.3); soy 0.4 % 
(0.0–0.8); wheat 0.2 % (0.0–0.5) and 0.1 % (0.0–0.32) for fish. The cumulative incidence of IgE-mediated food allergy 
was 2.6 % with 2.1 % reacting to hens’ egg. For non-IgE-mediated food allergy the cumulative incidence was 2.4 % 
(cows’ milk 1.7 %). Predictors for any food hypersensitivity were wheeze, maternal atopy, increasing gestational age, 
age at first solid food introduction and mean healthy dietary pattern score. Predictors for IgE mediated allergy were 
eczema, rhinitis and healthy dietary pattern score whereas for non-IgE-mediated food allergy the predictors were dog 
in the home, healthy dietary pattern score, maternal consumption of probiotics during breastfeeding and age at first 
solid food introduction.
Conclusions: Just under half the infants with confirmed food hypersensitivity had no demonstrable IgE. In an 
exploratory analysis, risk factors for this phenotype of food hypersensitivity differed from those for IgE-mediated food 
allergy except for a healthy infant diet which was associated with less risk for both phenotypes.

Background
Food hypersensitivity continues to be a concern for 
health care professionals and the general population 
since it adversely affects quality of life [1, 2] and house-
hold and healthcare expenditure [3, 4]. Any public health 
concern needs local incidence and prevalence data [5] 
and this is particularly relevant for food hypersensitivity 
due to conflicting opinions as to prevalence [6, 7]. There 
is also great interest in its potential risk factors due to its 
association with the development of other conditions [8, 
9]. Since geographical issues are also important in the 
development of food hypersensitivity, not all previously 
identified risk factors may be associated with food hyper-
sensitivity development in a UK cohort in infants. One 
study has looked at risk factors of food hypersensitivity 
development in the UK but it only considered dietary 
factors [10]. We have previously described the relation-
ship between breast feeding, complementary feeding and 
dietary patterns and food hypersensitivity in this cohort. 
In this publication we now present data on the incidence 
of food allergy in the UK within a general UK cohort and 
describes the results of a follow up of 1140 infants pairs. 
In an additional exploratory analysis, we also aimed to 
investigate the possible risk factors for IgE and non-IgE 
mediated food allergy.
Methods
Study design
The PIFA (prevalence of infant food allergy) study is 
the UK cohort of the EuroPrevall project [11] which 
recruited 1140 babies between 2006 and 2008. Its design 
has been described elsewhere [11, 12] but the main 
points of its methodology are reported here. It received 
approval from Research and Development departments 
at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital, Winchester and 
Southampton General Hospital and ethical approval was 
granted by North and Mid Hampshire Local Research 
Ethics Committee and Southampton and South West 
Hampshire Local Research Ethics Committee (05/
Q1703/34).
All eligible pregnant women registered with the Hamp-
shire Hospitals Foundation Trust midwifery service were 
invited to take part in the study. Interested women met 
one of the study research fellows when informed consent 
was taken and baseline information on socio-economic, 
environmental and family allergy history was collected 
[12]. Potential reactions to food were identified via 
parental reporting and the 12 and 24 month question-
naires. Those infants displaying signs or symptoms which 
fulfilling the EuroPrevall-wide criteria for assessment 
as described in Keil et al. [12] and also detailed in Fig. 1 
were invited to attend the Southampton Wellcome Trust 
Clinical Research Facility (WTCRF). Those who went on 
to meet the eligibility criteria to perform a double-blind, 
placebo-controlled challenge (DBPCFC) of an (Fig. 1) 
returned on two subsequent days for this to be carried 
out. Additional dietary intake data was invited from all 
study participants in the form of a prospective food diary 
kept for the first year of life [13, 14]. The study received 
ethics approval as detailed previously [13, 14].
Food hypersensitivity definitions
‘Parent perceived food hypersensitivity’ describes when 
a parent suspected their child had a reaction to food. 
A positive double-blind, placebo-controlled challenge 
(DBPCFC) was defined as either (1) objective immedi-
ate type symptoms or signs within 2 h of the final dose 
and/or (2) parentally reported objective signs of delayed 
reactions (vomiting, diarrhoea, hives and worsening 
of eczema), up to 48 h after challenge. With a positive 
DBPCFC, if there was a positive specific IgE (SpIgE) 
(≥0.35 kUl/L) or skin prick test (SPT) (wheal diam-
eter ≥3 mm), the infant was described as food allergic 
[15]. Food hypersensitivity without sensitisation was 
described as ‘non-IgE food hypersensitivity’
. ‘Food hyper-
sensitivity’ is used to describe all positive DBPCFC.
Control infants
Every child with DBPCFC diagnosed food hypersensitiv-
ity was allocated two age-matched controls, who were 
selected by approaching parents of infants with birth-
days just before or after the child with a confirmed food 
hypersensitivity until two controls were found. Since the 
control child was not selected until after a positive food 
challenge, some months may have passed between the 
time of the initial assessment of the case and the initial 
assessment of the control. There was however, never 
more than 4 weeks between the positive food challenge 
result and the assessment of the control child. Each con-
trol child was assessed in the same manner (apart from 
SPT) as the symptomatic infants, including a blood sam-
ple, to ensure they exhibited no signs of food allergy [12].
Statistical analysis
Analysis was carried out using SPSS version 21 (IBM, 
New York, USA) and STATA version 12 (College Sta-
tion, USA). The infant healthy eating pattern score 
was derived by PCA analysis of the food diet data as 
described previously and describes the dietary compo-
nent which accounted for 50 % of the variance and had 
high positive values associated with fruit, vegetable, fish 
and poultry consumption. Low/negative values associ-
ated with highly processed adult foods (such as ready 
meals, cook in-sauces, potato products and bacon) and 
the use of commercial baby foods more than once a day 
[13]. Cumulative incidence of food hypersensitivity was

calculated with 95 % confidence intervals. Exploratory 
analyses assessed whether any potentially important 
exposures were significantly related to food hypersensi-
tivity. A univariate logistic regression approach was taken 
followed by backwards multivariable analysis (which 
initially included factors with p < 0.1). Where the cells 
formed by the outcome and categorical predictor vari-
ables had no observations, exact logistic regression or 
the Bayesian firth logic approach was used to calculate 
odds ratios [16]. As an example of power for this explora-
tory analysis, with exposure rates of 62 and 35 % in cases 
and controls respectively and 41 cases and 82 controls, 
we had 80 % power to detect a significant relationship 
between the exposure and outcome at a 5 % level of sig-
nificance (STATA version 12).
Results
Participants
1605 pregnant women initially expressed an interest in 
participating in the study. 402 mothers subsequently 
declined, mainly due to time commitments or unwilling-
ness for their child to have blood tests. We had no ethi-
cal approval to collect further data about these women. 
1203 infants were born of which 63 were excluded either 
because they did not satisfy the inclusion criteria (due 
to low apgar, premature delivery or delivery outside the

recruitment period) or they had missing birth data. The 
resultant baseline cohort was 1140 (Table 1). A total of 
823 (72.2 %) infants were followed up to 2 years (Fig. 2).
Cumulative incidence of food hypersensitivity
210 infants (25.5 %; 95 % CI 22.5–28.5) had parental per-
ceived food hypersensitivity. 173 of these were identified 
via parental phone call to the study office and 61 were 
identified via administration of the questionnaire (55 at 
12 months and 10 at 24 months). Of these 210 infants, 
135 met the criteria for assessment and were invited for 
clinical assessment. Those not invited for assessment had 
other presentations, e.g. lactose intolerance and perioral 
rash with acidic foods. Of the 135 infants who under-
went clinical assessment, 70 were eligible for a DBPCFC. 
Fifty-five infants underwent the DBPCFC and 41 of these 
had a positive DBPCFC giving a cumulative incidence 
of food hypersensitivity of 5.0 % (95 % CI 3.5–6.5). The 
cumulative incidence for individual foods were hens’ 
egg 2.7 % (1.6–3.8); cows’ milk 2.4 % (1.4–3.5); peanut 
0.7 % (0.1–1.3); soy 0.4 % (0.0–0.8); wheat 0.2 % (0.0–0.5) 
and 0.1 % (0.0–0.32) for fish, lentil and broccoli (Fig. 1). 
Twelve infants were reactive to more than one food. The 
commonest parentally reported symptoms at assessment 
were physician diagnosed eczema (12 infants) and vomit-
ing (11 infants).
Characteristics of participants with food hypersensitivity
Of the 41 infants with DBPCFC confirmed food hyper-
sensitivity, 38 had SpIgE assessed and 40 were skin prick 
tested. Eczema was the presenting symptoms in 16 
(39.0 %) of children with food hypersensitivity; gastroin-
testinal symptoms were the next most frequent (26.8 %). 
No child presented with a history of anaphylaxis (Table 2).

Potential risk factors for food hypersensitivity
Paternal, perinatal, environmental and infant nutritional 
factors were compared between cases of food hypersensi-
tivity and controls (Tables 2, 3, 4; Additional file 1: Table 
S1). Data relating infant diet to food hypersensitivity has 
been published in detail elsewhere [14, 15].
Factors significantly associated with food hypersensi-
tivity were eczema, rhinitis, maternal atopy, anti-reflux 
medication, other household smoking, dog in the home 
and a variety of dietary factors including age at first 
solids, infant healthy eating dietary pattern score and 
reduced intake of milk whilst breastfeeding. (Tables 2, 
3; Additional file 1: Table S1). The ‘infant received anti-
reflux medication’ and ‘reduced maternal milk intake 
whilst breastfeeding’ variables were removed from 
further analyses since any association was likely to be 
due to reverse causality. The variable ‘other household 
smoking’ was also removed from further analyses since 
the significant association seen may be due to the low 
level seen in the control infants compared to all study 
participants and not a causal relationship. All the fac-
tors related to food hypersensitivity (p < 0.1) were 
included in the multivariable analysis (see Tables 2, 
3; Additional file 1: Table S1–S9). After the multivari-
able analysis wheeze, maternal atopy, gestational age, 
age at first solids and mean healthy eating dietary pat-
tern score remained independent factors in the model. 
Wheeze (aOR 20.59) and maternal atopy (aOR 87.48) 
were factors that increased risk of food hypersensitiv-
ity. Increasing gestational age (aOR 0.171), age at solid 
introduction (aOR 0.506) and healthy eating dietary 
pattern score (aOR 0.155) were associated with a signifi-
cant reduction in risk (Table 4).
IgE‑mediated food allergy compared to non‑IgE‑mediated 
food hypersensitivity
21 infants (cumulative incidence 2.6 %, 1.52–3.6) had 
IgE-mediated food allergy. Incidences for individuals 
foods were hens’ egg 2.1 % (1.1–3.0); cows’ milk 0.7 % 
(0.2–1.3); peanut 0.6 % (0.1–1.1); and 0.1 % (0.0–0.4) for 
soy, wheat and fish. Eight infants reacted to more than 
one food. Infants with non-IgE-mediated food hypersen-
sitivity reacted most frequently to cows’ milk (1.7 %, 0.8–
2.6) then hens’ egg (0.6 %, 0.1–1.1; soy (0.2 %, 0.0–0.6); 
and peanut, wheat, lentil and broccoli (0.1 %, 0.0–0.4). 
Four infants reacted to more than one food. No infant 
had both IgE-mediated allergy and non-IgE-mediated 
food reactions (Additional file 1: Table S2) and no infant 
with IgE ≥0.35 kU/l had symptoms after 2 h of ingesting 
the culprit food (Additional file 1: Table S3).

There were significant differences between the two 
phenotypes of food hypersensitivity. When comparing 
the two phenotypes, significant differences were found 
for maternal food hypersensitivity (0.013), mean time to 
reaction after food ingestion (p = 0.007), current eczema 
(p = 0.028), an urban living environment (p = 0.015), fish 
oil supplement use during pregnancy (p = 0.025), pro-
biotic use during breastfeeding (p = 0.009) and day care 
attendance (p = 0.025) (Additional file 1: Table S3).
Risk factors for IgE- and non-IgE-mediated reactions 
differed (Additional file 1: Tables S4–S9). For infants with 
IgE-mediated food allergy (n = 21), they were current 
eczema, current rhinitis, maternal atopy, wheeze with an 
upper respiratory tract infection, vitamin D supplementa-
tion during pregnancy and infant healthy infant diet score. 
In a multivariable analysis, the independent risk factors for 
IgE-mediated food allergy were eczema (aOR 18.67, 1.03–
338.41), rhinitis (aOR 4.80, 1.19–19.36) and infant healthy 
eating dietary pattern score (aOR 0.32, 0.16–0.66). In con-
trast, for infants with non-IgE-mediated food hypersen-
sitivity (n = 20), the risk factors were a dog in the home, 
infant healthy eating dietary pattern score, maternal age,

paternal age, other household smoking, anti-reflux medi-
cation use, age at first solids and concurrent breastfeeding 
with cows’ milk from any source. In a multivariable analy-
sis, the independent risk factors for non-IgE-mediated 
food hypersensitivity were dog in the home (aOR 19.49, 
1.17–325.93), consuming probiotics whilst breastfeeding 
(aOR 45.41, 3.41–604.67), age at first solid food introduc-
tion (aOR 0.60, 0.40–0.89) and infant healthy eating die-
tary pattern score (aOR 0.28, 0.09–0.87) (Table 4).
Discussion
In this UK cohort we found the cumulative incidence of 
DBPCFC confirmed food hypersensitivity to be 5.0 % 
(3.7–6.7). This is a little higher than other published figures 
of 0.0–4.2 % in the 0–5 year age group [5]. This is probably 
due to methodological differences since many studies only 
performed DBPCFC if there was sensitisation thus poten-
tially missing non-IgE-mediated food hypersensitivity. 
The observed difference may also be due to geographical

differences since it is thought the incidence of food hyper-
sensitivity reactions is higher in Northern European coun-
tries [5].
Since all children with a clinical history of food hyper-
sensitivity were challenged in this study, a cumulative 
incidence for both IgE- and non-IgE-mediated conditions 
could be determined: 2.6 % (1.5–3.6) for IgE-mediated 
food allergy and 2.4 % (1.4–3.5) for non-IgE-mediated 
food hypersensitivity. There is a lack of published data 
for non-IgE-mediated food hypersensitivity for compari-
son, but our results are broadly similar to those published 
in the most recent systematic review [17] although they 
are somewhat higher for hens’ egg (2.1 % compared to 
0.0–1.7 %).
Novel to this study was the ability to look at risk factors 
for differing phenotypes of food hypersensitivity. Our 
exploratory analysis showed the factors associated with 
food hypersensitivity were wheeze, maternal atopy, gesta-
tion, age at first solids and healthy eating dietary pattern, 
which are similar to those found in previous research 
[18–25]. For IgE-mediated disease, the multivariable 
analysis demonstrated eczema, rhinitis and healthy eat-
ing pattern to be significant independent risk factors. The 
association between eczema and food allergy has long 
been recognised [26] and the opinion that eczema is a 
likely risk factor for food allergy is becoming more widely 
accepted due to data relating filaggrin gene defects with 
the development of eczema, allergic sensitization, and 
asthma and allergic rhinitis [27–29]. Filaggrin gene defect 
leads to a damaged skin barrier which increases perme-
ability to exogenous proteins and possibly exposure of 
the innate immune system to allergens [30]. This phe-
nomenon may also account for rhinitis being a risk fac-
tor for food allergy since the infant may also have become 
sensitised to aeroallergens through a damaged epithe-
lial layer [31]. A healthy eating pattern was identified as 
being protective against the development of food allergy 
with the possible mechanism being the immunomodu-
latory effect of nutrients found in fruit and vegetables 
which were a feature of the observed healthy eating pat-
tern along with a predominantly home-cooked diet [13]. 
Fruit and vegetables are good sources of vitamin C, beta-
carotenes, folate and oligo-saccharides all of which have 
been shown to have immunomodulatory actions [32–34]. 
Also, home processed foods may have a higher microbial 
load than commercially prepared foods [35] and this may 
offer protection from the development of allergic disease 
as suggested by the “Hygiene Hypothesis” [36].
In the multivariable analysis for infants with non-
IgE-mediated food hypersensitivity, dog in the home, 
healthy eating pattern, probiotic whilst breastfeeding 
and younger age at first solid food introduction were 
independent risk factors. The nature of the relationship 
between pet ownership and allergy development is still 
under debate [37–40]. If a protective effect is only seen 
for IgE-mediated conditions then that may explain the 
conflicting findings in the literature. It is recognised that 
pet ownership results in altered household microbial 
communities [41] and that these differences can lead to 
altered gut flora [42]. Whilst this may lead to changes in 
the immune system which reduce the risk of IgE-medi-
ated allergy [43] this altered gut flora can adversely affect 
digestive enzyme activity, particularly of lactase. This is 
a previously reported phenomenon [44] and since the 
majority of infants with non-IgE-mediated food hyper-
sensitivity were reactive to milk, this is a potential mech-
anism for these cases.
The effect of altered gut microbiota may also be the 
reason for other observed associations in these infants 
including healthy eating pattern and probiotic consump-
tion during breastfeeding. The healthy eating dietary pat-
tern may have a protective effect on gut health since it 
contained large amounts of home processed fruits and 
vegetables which are good sources of oligo-saccharides 
which, as naturally occurring prebiotics, promote gut 
colonization by bifidobacterium [45]. The observed asso-
ciation between probiotic consumption during breast-
feeding and non-IgE-mediated food hypersensitivity is 
not readily explained but it can be hypothesised that it 
relates to the effect of the infant gut flora on gut enzyme 
activity. There is evidence that probiotics taken when 
breastfeeding alter breast milk composition [46] and 
that this may reduce the risk of allergy development in 
the infant [47]. However, there is no data describing the 
effect of maternal consumption of probiotic during lacta-
tion on the infant gut flora but it could be hypothesised 
that it increases the bifidobacteria colonisation that has 
been reported during breastfeeding [48] thus enhanc-
ing the effect of the breast milk on gut flora further. At 
breastfeeding cessation the infant’s gut flora becomes 
predominantly populated by coliform and bacteroid 
bacteria [48] which do not aid gut enzyme activity like 
hybridisable bacteria does [49] so the sudden change in 
the gut enzyme promoting environment may cause the 
observed Non-IgE mediated symptoms.
The age at first solid food introduction was signifi-
cantly different for food hypersensitivity and for non-
IgE-mediated food hypersensitivity. This observation 
could explain why some previous studies found an 
association between the early introduction of solids 
and food hypersensitivity [23, 24] and others have not 
[50, 51] since most studies do not identify the pheno-
type of hypersensitivity being investigated. It is consid-
ered that the infant gut is relatively immature before 
age 4–6 months and introducing solids before this time 
could cause food hypersensitivity symptoms, due to 
 Page 11 of 13
Grimshaw et al. Clin Transl Allergy  (2016) 6:1 
physiological mechanisms such as high intestinal perme-
ability [52] which could upset the normal homeostasis of 
mucosal cell transport processes [53].
The strengths of this analysis include a large cohort 
of 1140 infants at general risk of developing food 
hypersensitivity with good follow-up to 24 months 
and a diagnosis using the gold standard methodology 
of a DBPCFC. Additionally, the methodology allowed 
for the prospective identification and clinical assess-
ment of infants reacting to foods which reduced the 
likelihood of tolerance developing before a diagno-
sis could be confirmed. The prospective design also 
reduced the likelihood of recall bias during data col-
lection and the prospective collection of food diary 
data is unique in a cohort of this size. Limitations of 
our analysis are that the study population is not fully 
representative of the population from which it was 
recruited since our mothers are older (Fig. 3). Also, 
the control infants were 5 months older than the cases 
as they were matched by birth but recruited after the 
cases were assessed; since control infants had never 
had any adverse reactions to food we do not expect 
this difference to impact on any of the factors included 
in the risk factor analyses. Additional limitations are 
that the numbers of infants diagnosed as reactive to 
foods were too small to enable all the likely risk fac-
tors to be detected, or to allow us to look at individ-
ual food reactions to determine whether different 
foods behave differently and have different risk fac-
tors associated with them. Also, despite the prospec-
tive nature of the study, reverse causality could not be 
completely avoided as clinical symptoms can lead to 
treatments which are subsequently associated with the 
condition in an analysis, as was the case for anti-reflux 
medication. Furthermore, a diagnosis of allergy can 
result in a change of behaviour as was the case for 
when mothers first introduced egg into the diet. How-
ever, where there was a suspicion of reverse causality, 
the variable was not included in the final multivariable 
analysis thus reducing its effect on the final study find-
ings. Finally, the risk factor investigation represents an 
exploratory analysis and needs to be replicated, since 
possible regional differences within the UK may mean 
the findings from this study are not necessarily nation-
ally representative.
Conclusions
This study presents unique data from the UK on both 
IgE-mediated food allergy and non IgE-mediated food 
hypersensitivity in early childhood. It found the cumu-
lative incidence of DBPCFC confirmed food hypersen-
sitivity to be 5.0 % (3.7–6.7). Our results also suggest 
that different factors may affect the development of IgE-
mediated and non-IgE-mediated reactions to food in 
infants and young children. However, it is important that 
this exploratory analysis is confirmed in other cohorts. 
Analysis of the EuroPrevall data from all the birth cohort 
centres for all food reactions can build upon this work 
and also investigate any geographical differences to food 
hypersensitivity reactions.
