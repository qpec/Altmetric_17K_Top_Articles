Association of Hospital Critical Access Status With Surgical
Outcomes and Expenditures Among Medicare Beneficiaries
Andrew M. Ibrahim, MD; Tyler G. Hughes, MD; Jyothi R. Thumma, MPH; Justin B. Dimick, MD, MPH
IMPORTANCE Critical access hospitals are a predominant source of care for many rural
populations. Previous reports suggest these centers provide lower quality of care for
common medical admissions. Little is known about the outcomes and costs of patients
admitted for surgical procedures.
OBJECTIVE To compare the surgical outcomes and associated Medicare payments at critical
access hospitals vs non–critical access hospitals.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Cross-sectional retrospective review of 1 631 904
Medicare beneficiary admissions to critical access hospitals (n = 828) and non–critical access
hospitals (n = 3676) for 1 of 4 common types of surgical procedures—appendectomy, 3467
for critical access and 151 867 for non–critical access; cholecystectomy, 10 556 for critical
access and 573 435 for non–critical access; colectomy, 10 198 for critical access and 577 680
for non–critical access; hernia repair, 4291 for critical access and 300 410 for non–critical
access—between 2009 and 2013. We compared risk-adjusted outcomes using a multivariable
logistical regression that adjusted for patient factors (age, sex, race, Elixhauser
comorbidities), admission type (elective, urgent, emergency), and type of operation.
EXPOSURES Undergoing surgical procedures at critical access vs non–critical access hospitals.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Thirty-day mortality, postoperative serious complications
(eg, myocardial infarction, pneumonia, or acute renal failure and a length of stay >75th
percentile). Hospital costs were assessed using price-standardized Medicare payments during
hospitalization.
RESULTS Patients (mean age, 76.5 years; 56.2% women) undergoing surgery at critical access
hospitals were less likely to have chronic medical problems, and they had lower rates of heart
failure (7.7% vs 10.7%, P < .0001), diabetes (20.2% vs 21.7%, P < .001), obesity (6.5% vs
10.6%, P < .001), or multiple comorbid diseases (% of patients with �2 comorbidities; 60.4%
vs 70.2%, P < .001). After adjustment for patient factors, critical access and non–critical
access hospitals had no statistically significant differences in 30-day mortality rates (5.4% vs
5.6%; adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.96; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.89-1.03; P = .28).
However, critical access vs non–critical access hospitals had significantly lower rates of
serious complications (6.4% vs 13.9%; OR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.32-0.39; P < .001). Medicare
expenditures adjusted for patient factors and procedure type were lower at critical access
hospitals than non–critical access hospitals ($14 450 vs $15 845; difference, −$1395, P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among Medicare beneficiaries undergoing common surgical
procedures, patients admitted to critical access hospitals compared with non–critical access
hospitals had no significant difference in 30-day mortality rates, decreased risk-adjusted
serious complication rates, and lower-adjusted Medicare expenditures, but were less
medically complex.

C
ritical access hospital designation was created to help
ensure access to the more than 59 million people liv-
ing in rural populations.1 Established in 1997 under
the Medicare Rural Hospital Flexibility Program when
policy makers were worried these hospitals would close due
to financial hardship, the critical access hospital provision
entitled hospitals to increased reimbursements if they had
fewer than 25 inpatient beds and were located more than 35
miles away from another hospital.2 More than 1300 hospi-
tals enrolled in this program, but concern about the resul-
tant Medicare budget growing to more than $9 billion annu-
ally led government agencies and advisory groups to call for
modification and even elimination of the critical access
designation.3-6 Advocates for critical access hospitals argue
that changes would be disruptive to communities that heav-
ily rely on them for their health care.7,8
Debates about the value of critical access hospitals
continue with limited evidence about the clinical out-
comes and costs to Medicare in these settings. Increased
mortality rates and worse process of care measures have
been reported for common medical admissions at critical
access hospitals9,10; however, far less is known about
patients undergoing surgical procedures. To date the largest
study of surgical outcomes captures only approximately
one-third of critical access hospitals and lacks postdischarge
follow-up and payment information.11 Nevertheless, this
single study found no difference in postoperative mortality
rates suggesting that critical access hospitals may provide
comparable surgical care with their acute care counterparts.
Whether these findings are representative of surgical care
across all critical access hospitals and what the costs are to
Medicare remain unknown.
The purpose of this study was to evaluate outcomes and
costs among Medicare beneficiaries undergoing surgical pro-
cedures at critical access and non–critical access hospitals.
Methods
Data Source and Hospital Designation
Data from the Medicare Provider Analysis and Review
(MEDPAR) file between 2009 and 201326 were used for this
study. This represented 5 years of the most recent data
available and also a time period after nearly all (1277 of
1333; 95.7%) of the current critical access hospitals had
undergone designation.12 MEDPAR Hospital provider num-
bers that included “13” in the third and fourth positions
were identified as critical access hospitals.13 This study
was approved by the University of Michigan Investiga-
tional Review Board and deemed exempt due to use of
secondary data.
Identification of Procedures and Study Cohort
Using procedure codes from the International Classification
of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-
9-CM), a subset of general surgery procedures that would be
commonly performed at both critical access and non–
critical access hospitals were identified. Because larger,
complex operations (eg, pancreatic and esophageal resec-
tion) are not typically performed at critical access hospitals,
the most common operations performed in that setting
were chosen; appendectomy (ICD-9-CM codes 47.01, 47.09,
47.11, 47.19), cholecystectomy (ICD-9-CM codes 51.22, 51.23,
51.24), colectomy (ICD-9-CM codes 45.70, 45.71, 45.72,
45.73, 45.74, 45.75, 45.76, 45.79, 17.31 to 17.39, 45.80) and
hernia repair (ICD-9-CM codes 53.41, 53.42, 53.43, 53.49,
53.51, 53.59, 53.61, 53.62, 53.63, 53.69). These operations
represent the 4 most common inpatient general surgery
procedures performed at critical access hospitals. In review
of the data, 0.004% of patients were missing information on
race, and they were excluded.
Outcome Variables
Outcomes between critical access and non–critical access
hospitals were assessed by determining rates of mortality,
overall complications, serious complications, reoperations,
and readmissions. Mortality in the hospital was determined
by vital status at the time of discharge. Additionally, the
Medicare beneficiary denominator file was used to ascertain
any mortality occurring within 30 days of the index opera-
tion. The latter approach identified patients who died after
discharge from their index admission or after transfer to
another facility.
Complications were identified with ICD-9-CM codes
using methods previously described and validated.14,15
Overall complications included pulmonary failure, pneumo-
nia, myocardial infarction, deep venous thrombosis, acute
renal failure, postoperative hemorrhage, surgical-site infec-
tion, and gastrointestinal bleeding. Serious complications
were defined as having at least 1 complication and a length
of stay higher than the 75th percentile for the specific proce-
dure that was performed previously in the administrative
claims databases to improve specificity.16,17
Similarly, reoperation and readmission within 30 days
was identified using ICD-9-CM codes in methods that have
been previously used for surgical cohorts.18,19 Outcomes
were reported for all procedures combined as well as for
each procedure group. Patients who were transferred during
hospitalization were categorized based on the location of
their index operation.
Medicare Payments
Medicare payments from MEDPAR were used to explore
if location of care—critical access vs non–critical access
hospitals—was associated with any difference in expendi-
tures. Because there is wide variation in hospital charges that
may not reflect the actual financial expense to Medicare, the
analysis herein used Medicare payments. The total episode
payment was defined as the sum of diagnosis related group
payments, outlier payments, and payments for readmissions
within 30 days of discharge.
To compare Medicare expenditures at critical access
hospitals with non–critical access hospitals, actual pay-
ments (unadjusted) and price-standardized payments were
examined. Actual Medicare payments were chosen because
they represent the bottom line to Medicare, ie, as the actual

amount paid to the hospital. For additional comparison,
price-standardized payments were also evaluated.
This analysis was done because payments from Medicare
are determined in part by geography (to account for variation
in cost of living and the wage index) and the setting in which
they provide care (eg, if hospitals care to a disproportionate
share of low-income patients or participate in graduate medi-
cal education.) By removing these intended adjustments, the
comparison of price-standardized amounts provides better
insight into differences in resource use between critical
access and non–critical access hospitals. For price standard-
ization, this study used methods described initially by the
Medicare Payment Advisory Commission21,22 and later by the
Dartmouth Institute to account for these adjustments,22 as
has been done in multiple previous reports using MEDPAR
data to examine payments for surgical procedures.17,23 Fur-
thermore, because data were assessed over a 5-year period,
payment amounts were adjusted to 2013 dollars to account
for inflation.
Statistical Analysis
The first step of the analysis compared hospital and patient
characteristics for critical access and non–critical access hos-
pitals. Hospital characteristics included bed size, teaching sta-
tus, geography, staffing ratios, surgical volume, and fre-
quency of each procedure type. These were compared using
χ2 and Wilcoxon rank sum tests as appropriate. Similar com-
parisons of patient characteristics were carried out including
age, sex, race, comorbidities, admission type, distance trav-
eled to hospital for care, and destination after discharge
(eg, home, transferred, skilled nursing facility.)
The second step of the analysis was to determine whether
a difference existed in clinical outcomes or Medicare pay-
ments at critical access vs non–critical access hospitals. To
evaluate postoperative outcomes, a multivariable logistical re-
gression model was created with each outcome (eg, all com-
plications, mortality, readmission, etc) as a dependent vari-
able. The model was developed using a backward stepwise
logistic regression including multiple patient and operation-
level variables such as age, sex, race, comorbidities (as out-
lined previously by Elixhauser et al24 and Southern et al25), ad-
mission type (elective, urgent, emergency), and a variable
indicating the type of operation. Secular trends were ac-
counted for by including the year of operation as a categori-
cal variable. The model was then used to calculate a risk-
adjusted rate for each outcome.
Multiple strategies were used to evaluate the statis-
tical performance of the regression models. First, discrimi-
nation was assessed with receiver operating characteristic
curves and a C statistic was calculated for each outcome
(average C statistic of 0.77; eTable1 in the Supplement).
Next, the calibration of each model was evaluated with a
goodness-of-fit test that demonstrated a good match
between observed and expected outcomes across all deciles
of risk. For each independent variable, the variation infla-
tion factor was calculated with no evidence of multicol-
linearity (all variance inflations factors were <1.3; eTable2 in
the Supplement).
To test for possible nesting effects of patients within
hospitals, a 2-tier hierarchical model was created using
patient factors (level 1) and hospital factors (level 2). There
was no difference in these point estimates generated by the
hierarchical model compared with the multivariable regres-
sion model that used robust standard errors to account for
clustering (eTable3 in the Supplement). Finally, the day of
admission (weekday vs weekend) was added into the regres-
sion model and demonstrated no significant effect on the
results (eTable4 in the Supplement).
Medicare payments were then compared between criti-
cal access and non–critical access hospitals. After log trans-
formation to account for their nonparametric distribution,
payments were compared in 3 different forms: (1) actual
Medicare payments before any adjustment; (2) after risk-
adjustment for patient characteristics, procedure type, and
type of admission; and (3) after additional price standard-
ization. To adjust for clustering within hospitals, robust
standard errors were used for all models.
All reported P values were 2-sided and a value of <.05 was
used as threshold for significance. All statistical analyses were
completed with STATA version 14 (STATA Corp).
Results
Significant differences existed between patients treated at
critical access vs non–critical access hospitals. Patients
undergoing surgical procedures at critical access hospitals
were less likely to have common or multiple comorbid con-
ditions (Table 1). They had lower rates of heart failure, dia-
betes, obesity, or multiple comorbidities (% of patients with
≥2 comorbidities; 60.4% vs 70.2%, P < .001). Emergency
operations were more common at non–critical access hospi-
tals (44.6% vs 27.4%, P < .001). When comparing discharge
destination, patients treated at critical access hospitals were
less likely to use skilled nursing care (27.1% vs 37.9%,
P < .001). A higher proportion of patients at critical access
hospitals were transferred to another acute care hospital
than those treated in non–critical access hospitals (4.7% vs
0.8%, P < .001).
Non–critical access hospitals had significant struc-
tural differences compared with critical access hospitals.
Non–critical access hospitals on average had more operating
rooms (8 vs 2), more inpatient beds (>250 beds; 28.6% vs
0.0%) and higher nursing ratios (Table 2). Despite size and
resource differences, both types of hospitals performed a
similar proportion of the 4 operations examined (eg, colec-
tomy represented approximately 36% of surgical volume
for both types of hospitals). Non–critical access hospi-
tals had a higher annual median surgical volume than criti-
cal access hospitals (1624 vs 140, P < .001). Of the 1277
hospitals with a critical access designation during the
study period, 828 (64.8%) performed at least 1 of the 4
operations examined.
For common surgical procedures, patients at critical
access hospitals had either no significantly different or
lower risk-adjusted clinical outcomes compared with

non–critical access hospitals. Critical access hospitals
had lower rates of in-hospital mortality (2.9% vs 3.9%;
adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.69; 95% CI, 0.62-0.77; P < .001)
and no difference in 30-day mortality (5.4% vs 5.6%; OR,
0.96; 95% CI, 0.89-1.03; P = .28). Critical access hospitals
also had lower rates of serious complications (6.4% vs
13.9%; OR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.32-0.39; P < .001) and overall
complications (17.5% vs 25.4%; OR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.52-0.58;
P < .001). In contrast, critical access hospitals had higher
rates of readmission within 30 days than non–critical access
hospitals (14.7% vs 13.3%; OR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.08-1.18;
P < .001). Repeat subgroup analysis for each individual
procedure (appendectomy, cholecystectomy, colectomy,
hernia repair) demonstrated similar findings (Table 3).
Unadjusted rates of clinical outcomes are reported in eTable
5 in the Supplement.
Critical access hospitals had lower Medicare pay-
ments for common surgical procedures than non–critical
access hospitals. When examining all procedures combined,
actual Medicare payments at critical access hospitals were
$5980 lower than non–critical access hospitals ($15 094 vs
$21 074, P < .001). After both risk-adjustment and price-
standardization, payments to critical access hospitals
remained lower than non–critical access hospitals ($14 450 vs
$15 845; difference −$1395, P < .001). Similar differences were
found between payments across each of the procedures
examined individually (Table 4).
Discussion
This study had 2 principal findings regarding how sur-
gical care is delivered at critical access hospitals. First, the
study found that performance of 4 common surgical proce-
dures at critical access hospitals was associated with no dif-
ference in 30-day mortality and lower complication rates
compared with non–critical access hospitals. Second,
despite the reimbursement structure for critical access hos-
pitals established in the Medicare Rural Hospital Flexibility
Program, there was no evidence of higher expenditures for
common surgical procedures. Both of these findings con-
trast previously published literature about nonsurgical
admissions in these same settings and inform legislators
about the valuable role critical access hospitals provide in
the US health care system.
Previous studies examining outcomes at critical access
hospitals have raised concern about the quality of care pro-
vided. A recent study of Medicare beneficiaries admitted for
acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, or pneumonia to
critical access hospitals reported worse mortality rates and
lower adherence to process measures of care.9 A follow-up
study for the same medical conditions from 2002 to 2010
found that mortality rates at critical access hospitals actu-
ally increased, despite additional funding for quality
improvement efforts.10 However, these differences in

mortality between critical access vs non–critical access hos-
pitals have not been observed for surgical procedures. For
example, work done by Gadzinski and colleagues11 evalu-
ated patients in the National Inpatient Sample, a 20% strati-
fied sampled of nonfederal hospitals in the United States,
and found no difference in in-hospital mortality for multiple
surgical procedures.
The present study goes beyond these findings by assess-
ing a wider range of surgical outcomes and evaluating all criti-
cal access hospitals in the United States performing common
surgical procedures in Medicare beneficiaries.
Although the data from this study cannot identify a
clear mechanism for the contrast between medical and sur-
gical outcomes, the findings do suggest several possible
explanations. First, with surgery, critical access hospitals
have the opportunity to select appropriate candidates before
deciding whether to operate. In this study, critical access hos-
pitals generally operated on fewer complex patients (vs non–
critical access hospitals) and demonstrated relatively low
postoperative transfer rates (4.8% in this study compared
with ≤29% reported for medical admissions9,10). These
findings are consistent with the dual role rural surgeons
perform in providing safe local care on appropriately selected
patients but also in triaging higher-risk patients to larger
centers before an operation. For medical conditions, which
are less elective than the surgical procedures that we studied,
it is often not possible to make decisions before hospitaliza-
tion occurs.

Second, this study only includes a subset of relatively well-
resourced critical access hospitals; ie, those with the capabili-
tiestoperforminpatientgeneralsurgery.Thesehospitalslikely
have more staff and resources than do the larger population
of critical access hospitals that offer medical care.
Another important finding from this study was that
critical access hospitals were less likely to refer patients to
rehabilitation or skilled nursing facilities after discharge.
Although this finding may simply represent a healthier
patient population or less complex surgical procedures at
critical access hospitals, it could also reflect limited access
to postdischarge care that has been previously described in
rural settings.28 Specifically, patients were much less likely
to be discharged to postacute care facilities (27.1% vs 37.9%)
from critical access than from non–critical access hospitals.
This lower use of postdischarge care at critical access hospi-
tals could in turn account for the higher rate of readmission
observed in this study.
This study should be interpreted within the context of
certain limitations. First, administrative data have well-
known limitations for assessing comorbid conditions and
ascertaining complications of care factors.29,30 To minimize
any potential coding bias, this study used selected codes
from the Complication Screening Project that significantly
increase the specificity of detecting complications in claims
data.14,15 In addition, an extended length-of-stay criteria was
applied to increase the specificity of the complication mea-
sures. This approach has been demonstrated to more accu-
rately capture complicated hospital courses.31 Moreover,
other sources of data (eg, clinical registries) with more
detailed clinical and payer information do not include the
majority of rural and critical access hospitals.32,33
Second, because non–critical access hospitals are reim-
bursedbasedondiseaseseverityandhavemoreresources,they
may be more thoroughly documenting diagnoses codes. As a
result, this study could potentially overestimate complica-
tion rates and comorbidities of patients treated at non–
critical access hospitals. However, the comparisons between
critical access vs non–critical access hospitals were consis-
tent in measures that were not sensitive to this type of coding
bias (eg, mortality rates, reoperations, expenditures) making
the differences found in this study unlikely to be due to docu-
mentation alone.
Finally, by using Medicare data, this study population did
not include many younger patients who also seek care at criti-
cal access hospitals. Although this group of younger patients
is important to evaluate, the Medicare Rural Affordability Pro-
gram in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 was specifically de-
signed for Medicare beneficiaries and as such, evaluation in
Medicare data are most relevant to policy makers.
This study may have important policy implications for
payers and policy makers responding to mandates in the
Affordable Care Act to evaluate health care services for rural
Americans. First, patients in rural settings are sometimes

reluctant to travel for surgical care, even when told it would
lead to a better outcome.34 These same patients may often
prefer follow-up locally, independent of where their initial
operation occurred. Recent evidence suggests that, among
patients requiring rehospitalization, admission to the same
hospital where they had surgery improved survival.35 Main-
taining payment policies that secure safe, local surgical care
allows rural clinicians to accommodate strong patient pref-
erences without putting them at increased risk of undergo-
ing common operations. Second, although currently exempt
from Hospital-Value Based Purchasing, and many other pay-
ment reforms, these findings suggest that critical access
hospitals may benefit from participating in these reforms.
By providing comparable outcomes at a lower cost for com-
mon surgical procedures, critical access hospitals may find
it profitable to enroll in bundled payment programs.
Third, although only a minority of critical access hospi-
tals (≈5%) are currently participating in Medicare account-
able care organizations (ACOs), they may find that creating a
network relationship with larger facilities located in the near-
est metropolitan area could facilitate the important role they
are already playing in triaging and transferring patients to
higher levels of care when needed. Nevertheless, critical ac-
cess hospitals and rural surgical practices may have difficulty
meeting the reporting and regulatory requirements of these
new payment models.
Conclusions
Among Medicare beneficiaries undergoing common surgical
procedures, patients admitted to critical access hospitals
compared with non–critical access hospitals had no signifi-
cant difference in 30-day mortality rates, decreased risk-
adjusted serious complication rates, and lower-adjusted
Medicare expenditures, but were less medically complex.
