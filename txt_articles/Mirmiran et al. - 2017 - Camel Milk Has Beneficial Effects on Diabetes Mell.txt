Abstract
Context: Controlling diabetes, a worldwide metabolic disease, by effective alternative treatments is currently a topic of great inter-
est. Camel milk is believed to be a suitable hypoglycemic agent in experimental animals and patients with diabetes. The current
systematic review aimed at evaluating the effect of camel milk on diabetes.
Evidence Acquisition: A comprehensive search was dine in PubMed and Scopus for all clinical trials and animal studies docu-
mented up to 2015, which focused on the effect of camel milk on diabetes markers. Studies which assessed the effects of camel milk,
with no dose limit, on glucose parameters and lipid profiles in animals or humans with diabetes, were included. The quality of the
included clinical trials was evaluated by the Delphi score checklist.
Results: Theinitialsearchyielded73articles. Afterscreeningabstractsandfulltexts, 22articleswereincludedconsistingof 11animal
studiesand11clinicaltrials, 8of whichfocusedontype1diabetesandtheotherthreeontype2diabetes. Allanimalstudiesexceptfor1
showedsignificantreductionsinatleast1of thediabetesparameterssuchasbloodglucose,insulinresistance,glycatedhemoglobin,
and lipid profile. In most of the clinical trials, the recommended dose of camel milk was 500 mL/day, which led to improvement of
diabetes markers even after 3 months in patients with diabetes.
Conclusions: Most of the studies in the current systematic review demonstrated the favorable effects of camel milk on diabetes
mellitus by reducing blood sugar, decreasing insulin resistance and improving lipid profiles.
Keywords: Camel Milk, Diabetes, Insulin Resistance, Lipid Profile
1. Context
Diabetes mellitus is the most common metabolic dis-
ease associated with multiple complications such as car-
diovascular diseases, kidney failure, blindness, and ampu-
tation of lower extremities (1). It is predicted that by the
year 2035, there are about 592 million patients with type
2 diabetes worldwide (2). Moreover, it is estimated that
over the next decade, the total number of diabetes-related
deaths increases by more than 50% (3). Despite oral med-
ication, insulin, and diet therapy, diabetic complications
and immune response impairments are challenges in clin-
ical treatment of these conditions. Although insulin ther-
apyisthemaintreatment, patientswithdiabeteswhohave
needle phobia often prefer alternative treatments. Hence,
during the past years many efforts were made to develop
effective alternative treatments especially an appropriate
substitute for insulin delivery (4). Camel milk is supposed
to be a suitable alternative as it has an insulin like pro-
tein, which does not form coagulum in the acidic environ-
ment of stomach (5). It is shown that the incidence risk of
diabetes in camel breeders in India, who consume camel
milk regularly, is much lower compared to other commu-
nities in which camel milk is not consumed (6). Radioim-
munoassay analysis detected a high concentration of in-
sulin (52 U/L) in camel milk (7); it also contains large con-
centrations of immunoglobulin, lactoferrin, lactoperoxi-
dase, and peptidoglycan recognition protein, which have
biological and pharmacological properties (8). Recent ex-
perimental and clinical studies showed the beneficiary ef-
fects of camel milk on diabetes by improving the glycemic
control and decreasing insulin resistance (9-11). However,
the anti-diabetic action of camel milk is not yet fully elu-
cidated. Moreover, to the best of the authors‘ knowledge,
there is no documented systematic review on the role of
camel milk on diabetes. The current systematic review, tak-
ing in account all experimental and clinical trial studies,
aimed at summarizing published data on the beneficial ef-
fectsof camelmilktocontroltype1andtype2diabetesmel-

2. Evidence Acquisition
2.1. Search Strategy and Study Selection
A literature search was conducted on PubMed and Sco-
pus for entire clinical trials and animal studies published
on the effect of camel milk on diabetes markers up to
November 2015.
The search was conducted by 1 of the
authors and there was no restriction regarding publica-
tion date. Moreover, reference lists of the included stud-
ies and key reviews in the area were scanned for any addi-
tional relevant studies. The search terms included (camel
milk [Title/Abstract]) OR (camel dairy [Title/Abstract]) AND
(diabetes [Title/Abstract]) OR (diabetic [Title/Abstract]) OR
(hyperglycemia [Title/Abstract]) OR (fasting blood glucose
[Title/Abstract]) OR (insulin resistance [Title/Abstract]) OR
(serum insulin [Title/Abstract]) OR (impaired fasting glu-
cose [Title/Abstract]) OR (impaired glucose tolerance [Ti-
tle/Abstract]) OR (glucose homeostasis [Title/Abstract]).
Thesearchtermsusedforcamelmilkanddiabetessections
were linked using ‘OR’, and the results of the 2 sections
were combined by utilizing the ‘AND’.
The search results of databases were combined and du-
plicateswereremoved. Afterthat, screeningof articletitles
andabstractswasperformedindependentlyby2investiga-
tors, and irrelevant studies were removed. Then, the full
texts of potentially eligible studies were reviewed before
definitive inclusion. Disagreements between the 2 investi-
gatorswereresolvedbyconsensus, andthestudieswerein-
cludedif theyassessedtheeffectof camelmilkonglycemic
control or lipid profiles among patients with diabetes, or
experimentally induced diabetic animals.
2.2. Eligibility Criteria
Studies had to meet the following criteria to be in-
cluded in the current review:
- Measurements of the glucose parameters: Fasting
blood sugar levels (FBS), general blood glucose levels, post-
prandial blood glucose levels, serum levels of insulin, in-
sulin resistance [homeostatic model assessment-insulin
resistance (HOMA-IR)], and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c).
- Measurements of the lipid profiles Total cholesterol
(TC), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high den-
sity lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglycerides (TG).
- Types of interventions: Intervention criteria includ-
ing daily treatment by camel milk in animal or human
samples with diabetes, with no dose limits considered.
- Language: English
Obviously irrelevant studies, in vitro studies, studies
thatdidnotincludeanyof theprimaryoutcomemeasures,
studiesinlanguagesotherthanEnglish, non-experimental
studies (case studies, case series, cross-sectional, case-
control, and cohort), study protocols, and literature re-
views were excluded from the current systematic review.
2.3. Data Extraction
Relevant data were extracted from studies. Disagree-
ments between the 2 investigators were resolved through
discussion until consensus. The data extraction form in-
cluded the following information: first author’s name and
year of publication, country and study design, sample size,
range of follow-up, demographic characteristics of partic-
ipants, dose of camel milk intake, and the evaluated out-
comes.
2.4. Quality Assessment
Delphi checklist was used to assess the quality of the
included clinical trials and score the studies (12). The qual-
ity of reports was assessed. Disagreements between the 2
investigators were resolved through discussion until con-
sensus.
3. Results
3.1. Overview of Studies
The initial search yielded 73 articles that after remov-
ing the duplicates, 62 articles were assessed for titles and
abstracts. Exclusion of the articles was based on the con-
tent and its relevance to the current review, based on the
inclusion/exclusion criteria; hence, 40 articles were ex-
cluded for being review (n = 14), observational (n = 1), irrel-
evant to the main topic (n = 18), duplicates (n = 2), and in
vitro studies (n = 5). Ultimately, 22 articles were included
in the current systematic review, consisting of 11 animal
studies and 11 clinical trials, 9 of which focused on type 1
diabetes and the other 3 ones on type 2 diabetes (Figure 1).
Characteristics of the participants, interventions, method-
ological quality, and outcome measures of animal studies
and clinical trials are summarized in Tables 1 - 3.

3.2.1. Animal Studies
Out of 11 experimental studies, 2 were conducted on
dogs; in the first study, Sboui et al. evaluated the effect of
camel milk on blood glucose and cholesterol in alloxan-
induced diabetic dogs (n = 12). They divided dogs into 3
groups, 1 healthy controls and 2 diabetic groups; 1 of the di-
abetic groups and the controls received 500 mL/day camel
milk, while the other diabetic group received 500 mL/day

tion. Thecontrolgroupshowednosignificantdifferencein
the mentioned parameters after the intervention period;
results also showed that substituting cow milk with camel
milk in the cow milk diabetic group led to significant im-
provement in blood glucose (from 10.88 ± 0.50 to 5.77 ±
0.44mM/L,Pvalue< 0.05)andcholesterolstatus(from6.17
±0.15to4.35±0.61mM/L,Pvalue< 0.05)after4weeks(21).
In the other study, Sboui et al. compared the anti-diabetic
effect of 3 amounts of camel milk: 100, 250, and 500 mL on
alloxan- induced diabetic dogs. After 5 weeks, both groups
treated with 500 or 250 mL camel milk showed significant
decrease in blood glucose (about 48%, P value < 0.05) and
cholesterol (about 22%, P value < 0.05), with no significant
differencesbetweenthe2groups. Nosignificantdifference
was observed in such parameters in the dogs treated with
100 mL of camel milk (11); however, there was no control
group in this study and the effect of camel milk was not
compared with any kind of milks or treatments.
The other 9 studies were conducted on rats, and all
had control groups for their intervention; however, there
were some variations in the study design, sample size, du-
ration, and dosages of camel milk administration; in 6
of them diabetes was induced by streptozotocin. Most of
them demonstrated the effectiveness and superiority of
camel milk in glycemic control and insulin sensitivity as
well as improvement of lipid profiles in the diabetes in-
duced animals, when compared to the controlled or cow
milk groups. However, in the study by Alabdulkarim et al.
no significant difference was observed in plasma glucose
and triglyceride levels after administering either camel or
cow milk; in this study, 30 healthy female albino rats, aged
128 days were randomly divided into 5 groups, with the

control group receiving no milk, 2 groups were fed with
50% to 100% camel milk and 2 other groups with 50% to
100% cow milk (15). This study did not demonstrate the hy-
poglycemic effect of camel milk in the healthy rats. How-
ever, it is noteworthy that this study was conducted on
healthy rats; therefore, it was not logically appropriate
to conclude about the anti-diabetic effects of camel milk.
Baseline blood sugar should be considered in the interpre-
tation of results.
Wang et al. evaluated the efficacy of camel milk on
long-term glycemic control in diabetic rats; 32 obese rats
were randomly divided into 4 groups: the diabetic control
group, camel milk group, diabetic rosiglitazone maleate
group, and diabetic rosiglitazone maleate + camel milk
group. After 14 weeks of treatment, blood glucose, triglyc-
erides, total cholesterol, and plasma insulin significantly
decreased in the rosiglitazone maleate, the rosiglitazone
maleate + camel milk and the camel milk group com-

zone maleate + camel milk group had better treatment of
type 2 diabetes animal models than rosiglitazone maleate
group (22).
Al-Numair et al. in 5 studies on streptozotocin-induced
diabetic rats, evaluated the effect of camel milk on hyper-
lipidemia, activating of ATPase, antioxidant factors, colla-
gen abnormalities, and glycoprotein components (16-20);
30malealbinoratswererandomlydividedinto5groups(6
animals in each group): non-diabetic control, non-diabetic
fed with 250 mL/day camel milk, diabetic control, diabetic
fed with 250 mL/day camel milk, and diabetic given 600
µg/kg body weight glibenclamide; all groups were treated
for a period of 45 days. Diabetic rats treated with camel
milk or glibenclamide showed a significant decrease in
blood glucose (about 43% and 58%, respectively) and gly-
coproteins, and an increase in the insulin levels (P value <
0.05); results also showed that treatment with camel milk
improved the plasma total cholesterol, triglyceride, free
fatty acid, LDL, and HDL-cholesterol (about 42%, 26%, 42%,
25% and 13% respectively, P value < 0.05) in diabetic rats. It
seems that all of these 5 studies conducted by Al-Numair et
al. were 1 survey with reporting different results in differ-
ent papers.
Khan et al. examined the effect of camel milk on 40 di-
abetic rats, divided in a model similar to that of Al-Numair.
However, the rats in the 2nd and 4th groups were fed 400
mL/day camel milk and the 5th group was treated with in-
sulin instead of glibenclamide. The intervention period
was 30 days and similar outcomes were obtained ie, de-
creased blood glucose (from 520 to 235 mg/dL, P value <
0.05), triglyceride (about 35%, P value < 0.05), and total
cholesterol (about 34%, P value < 0.05) following camel
milk treatment (14). Korish et al. categorized 80 rats in
4 groups: the normal and diabetic control with no treat-
ment and the normal and diabetic groups treated with 35
mL/day camel milk for 8 weeks. At the end of the study, di-
abetic rats treated with camel milk showed significant de-
crease in fasting glucose (about 57%, P value < 0.001), in-
creased HDL-cholesterol (about 32%, P value < 0.001), de-
creasedHOMA-IR(about52%, Pvalue< 0.05), andincreased
fasting insulin (about 34%, P value < 0.05), compared to di-
abetic controls, while the control rats treated with camel
milk showed no significant changes in comparison with
normal controls (13).
Overall, camel milk treatment led to improvement of
blood glucose, serum insulin, and lipid profile in diabetic
animals. This potential positive role on diabetes control
could be related to the high content of insulin and in-
sulin like proteins that can increase the activity of in-
sulin receptors (31). Moreover, camel milk is believed to
decrease β-cell injuries because of certain specific types
of immunoglobulins, protective proteins (lactoferrin and
lactoperoxidase), and antioxidant agents; eg, zinc and vi-
tamin c and b3 (24). However, more experimental stud-
ies are needed to confirm the superiority and efficacy of
camel milk, compared with other milks and alternative
treatments for diabetes.

all the studies was 24 subjects. The control group (n = 12)
received usual care, while the intervention group received
500 mL/day camel milk in addition to usual care. In the
1st and 2nd studies, the mean age of participants was 20
years and the intervention time was 3 months. However,
the 2nd study had crossover design and after a 1-month
wash out period, the regimen was interchanged and in-
tervention and control groups were switched over to cow
milk and camel milk, respectively, for another 3 months. A
significant reduction was observed in FBS (from 115.66 to
100 mg/dL, P value = 0.002), HbA1c (from 9.54% to 9.08%,
P value = 0.002), and the mean doses of insulin injection
(from 41.66 to 30 U/day, P value = 0.002) in patients receiv-
ing camel milk even after 3 months of treatments; how-
ever, fasting plasma insulin, lipid profiles, and C-peptide
levels showed no significant change in either group (27,
28). The investigators rechecked this hypothesis on 13 to
15 and 6 to 25 year-old subjects in 2 other studies with one
year intervention period (25, 26). Moreover, in a study per-
formed on 14 to 16 year-old patients with type 1 diabetes for
2 years (10), which demonstrated the same results in im-
proving FBS (from 118.58 to 93.16 mg/dL), HbA1c (from 7.81%
to 5.44%), and the mean doses of insulin (P value < 0.05).
In another study, 50 patients newly diagnosed with type
1diabetes, aged 13 to 14 years, were divided into 2 groups,
the usual care and the 500 mL/d camel milk + usual care
groups. After 12 months, FBS (about 14%), HbA1c (about
8%) and the doses of insulin (about 37%) decreased, and
C-peptide levels (about 12%) increased significantly, in pa-
tients receiving camel milk (24). Although, in these stud-
ies, the effect of camel milk on diabetes parameters was as-
sessed in different age groups with differences in duration
of camel milk supplementation, in all of them except for
1, the comparison between camel milk and other kinds of
milk was ignored.
The beneficial effect of
camel milk in diabetic
nephropathy by improvement in micro albuminuria was
observed in a study performed on 24 patients with type
1diabetes, mean age 19 years, given 500 mL/day camel milk
in addition to usual care for 6 months; although mean
plasma glucose, insulin, and C-peptide levels showed no
significant changes in these patients after 6 months, their
lipid profiles and the mean dose of insulin injection to
obtain glycemic control decreased significantly (from
41.6 to 28.3 U/day, P value < 0.01); however, this study had
no control group and the effect of camel milk was not
compared with any kind of milks or treatments in this
study (23).
Mohamad et al. evaluated the effect of camel milk in
54 young patients with type 1diabetes, age range 17 to 20
years, randomly divided into 2 groups: the usual care and
the 500 mL/d camel milk + usual care. After 16 weeks of in-
tervention, FBS and HbA1c decreased (56% and 25%, respec-
tively, P value < 0.001) while C-peptide levels increased sig-
nificantly (88%, P value = 0.007) in the group treated with
camel milk (9).
Overall, most of these studies indicate the beneficial
effects of camel milk on type 1 diabetes through reduc-
tion in FBS, HbA1c, and the mean doses of insulin injection.
However, they are not high qualified according to Delphi
checklist (the mean score was 3) and more valid studies are
needed to prescribe camel milk in type 1 diabetes.
3.2.2.2. Type 2 Diabetes
Studies on the hypoglycemic potential of camel milk
on type 2 diabetes are limited. Wang et al. randomly di-
vided 12 patients with type 2 diabetes into 2 groups, with
6 patients receiving routine diabetes management and 6
other patients consumed 500 mL/day of raw camel milk.
The dose of potential rosiglitazone maleate administra-
tion was adjusted in both groups. In the group receiving
camel milk, there was a significant reduction in the mean
blood sugar (123.0 to 94.2 mg/dL, P value < 0.001), plasma
insulin (19.76 to 6.21 mIU/L, P value < 0.001), dose of drug
(4.67 to 1.67 U/d, P < 0.001), blood triglycerides (1.83 to 1.42
mM/L, P value < 0.001), and blood total cholesterol (7.7 to
6.1 mM/L, P value < 0.001), compared with baseline val-
ues (22). Agrawal et al. in a crossover design study, pre-
scribed 500 mL/day cow milk to 14 healthy males and 500
mL/day camel milk to 14 males with type 2 diabetes for 3
months; after 1 month washout period, the regimen was
interchanged for 3 months. FBS, HbA1c, and insulin levels
showed an improving trend both in males with diabetes
and the healthy ones after camel milk consumption (30).
Ejtahed et al. in a randomized, single-blinded controlled
clinical trial evaluated the effect of camel milk on blood
sugar and lipid profiles of 20 patients with type 2 diabetes
aged20to70years. Interventiongroup(n=11)received500
mL/day camel milk and control group (n = 9) consumed
500 mL/day cow milk for 2 months. Fasting blood sugar,
lipidprofilesandbloodpressureshowednosignificantdif-
ferences between the 2 groups at the end of the study, but
insulin concentration significantly increased (about 23%,
P value < 0.05) in the camel milk group during the study
(29). The variation in camel milk composition and clinical
characteristics of participants, short duration of interven-
tion, and low sample size could be the reasons of inconsis-
tent results in this study.
There are some possible mechanisms, which justifythe
anti-diabetic effects of camel milk. Camel milk contains
considerable level of insulin encapsulated in nanoparti-
clestotransportthishormoneintactintothebloodstream.
Camel milk insulin resists coagulum formation in the
stomach, and is absorbed in the small intestine (32). Fur-

thermore, camelmilkhassmallinsulin-likemoleculesthat
act like insulin in interacting with their receptors (33).
Camel milk has special proteins, lyzozymes, lactoferrin,
and lactoperoxidase, which are resistant to digestion by
pepsininthestomach; theseproteinsdonotcoagulateeas-
ily at low pH, and have a good buffering capacity (34).
As high production of oxidative stress factors in dia-
betes can lead to deleterious effects including damage to
polyunsaturated fatty acids in membrane lipids, proteins,
DNA, and eventually cell death (35), 1 of the positive roles
of camel milk in diabetes is its high level of antioxidants
postulated to have anti-inflammatory effects and immune-
modulatory functions on the β-Cells of the pancreas (13,
36). Whey protein of camel milk is easily available and is
supposed to reduce the effects of oxygen radicals by in-
creasing glutathione (37, 38); in addition to restoring nor-
mal ß-Cell mass and suppressing inflammatory cytokines
which lead to ß-Cell apoptosis in type 1 diabetes (39).
Certain other proteins in camel milk such as lactofer-
rin have an anti-inflammatory effect, which can inhibit
the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines; eg, tu-
mor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-6 in
mononuclear cells (40). On the other hand, camel milk de-
creases TNF-α and down regulates the expression of iNOS,
the major source of NO generation during inflammation
(41).
Increased oxidative damage also has a strong positive
association with abnormal lipid profiles, commonly ob-
served in patients with diabetes (42), the damage which
could be improved by the anti-inflammatory effect of
camel milk consumption.
High levels of antioxidant
agents such as zinc, selenium, and other trace elements
(43) in camel milk are also reported to prevent lipid perox-
idation, via enhancing the anti-oxidant system (44), or by
glutathione peroxidase activation (45). Overall, there are
limited studies with inconsistent results regarding the ef-
fects of camel milk on type 2 diabetes and further research
is required to confirm the long-term efficacy of camel milk
on biomarkers of type 2 diabetes.
4. Conclusions
In the current systematic review, the potentially pos-
itive effects of camel milk on diabetes mellitus were ex-
plored. Data available on experimental research and most
of the human studies indicated that camel milk admin-
istration can have positive effects on glycemic control,
by reducing fasting blood sugar, decreasing insulin resis-
tance, and improving lipid profiles among patients with
diabetes. In most studies, the recommended dose of camel
milk was 500 mL/day which led to improvement of dia-
betes markers even after 3 months in patients with dia-
betes. Moreover, the superiority of camel milk, compared
to cow milk was demonstrated in some human studies. Al-
though the high amount of digestion resistant insulin and
high level of antioxidants as anti-inflammatory factors are
the possible explanation for anti-diabetic effect of camel
milk in this review, however, more valid and comprehen-
sive studies are needed to support these findings.
