ABSTRACT
OBJECTIVE
To determine whether refugees are at elevated risk of 
schizophrenia and other non-affective psychotic 
disorders, relative to non-refugee migrants from 
similar regions of origin and the Swedish-born 
population.
DESIGN
Cohort study of people living in Sweden, born after 
1 January 1984 and followed from their 14th birthday 
or arrival in Sweden, if later, until diagnosis of a 
non-affective psychotic disorder, emigration, death, 
or 31 December 2011.
SETTING
Linked Swedish national register data.
PARTICIPANTS
1 347 790 people, including people born in Sweden to 
two Swedish-born parents (1 191 004; 88.4%), refugees 
(24 123; 1.8%), and non-refugee migrants (132 663; 
9.8%) from four major refugee generating regions: the 
Middle East and north Africa, sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, 
and Eastern Europe and Russia.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
Cox regression analysis was used to estimate adjusted 
hazard ratios for non-affective psychotic disorders by 
refugee status and region of origin, controlling for age 
at risk, sex, disposable income, and population 
density.
RESULTS
3704 cases of non-affective psychotic disorder were 
identified during 8.9 million person years of follow-up. 
The crude incidence rate was 38.5 (95% confidence 
interval 37.2 to 39.9) per 100 000 person years in the 
Swedish-born population, 80.4 (72.7 to 88.9) per 
100 000 person years in non-refugee migrants, and 
126.4 (103.1 to 154.8) per 100 000 person years in 
refugees. Refugees were at increased risk of psychosis 
compared with both the Swedish-born population 
(adjusted hazard ratio 2.9, 95% confidence interval 2.3 
to 3.6) and non-refugee migrants (1.7, 1.3 to 2.1) after 
adjustment for confounders. The increased rate in 
refugees compared with non-refugee migrants was 
more pronounced in men (likelihood ratio test for 
interaction χ2 (df=2) z=13.5; P=0.001) and was present 
for refugees from all regions except sub-Saharan 
Africa. Both refugees and non-refugee migrants from 
sub-Saharan Africa had similarly high rates relative to 
the Swedish-born population.
CONCLUSIONS
Refugees face an increased risk of schizophrenia and 
other non-affective psychotic disorders compared with 
non-refugee migrants from similar regions of origin 
and the native-born Swedish population. Clinicians 
and health service planners in refugee receiving 
countries should be aware of a raised risk of psychosis 
in addition to other mental and physical health 
inequalities experienced by refugees.
Introduction
Schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders lead to 
lifelong health and social adversities, culminating in a 
reduction in life expectancy of 10-25 years.1  Immigrants 
and their descendants are, on average, 2.5 times more 
likely to have a psychotic disorder than the majority 
ethnic group in a given setting,2 3  although the exact 
risk varies by ethnicity and setting. For example, in 
Europe, incidence rates for people of black Caribbean 
or African descent are approximately five times higher 
than those for the white European population.2 
4  These 
marked differences persist after adjustment for age, 
sex, and socioeconomic position,5  are maintained in 
the descendants of first generation migrants,2  and do 
not seem to be attributable to higher incidence rates in 
people’s country of origin or selective migration.6-9 
 
 
Possible explanations centre on various social deter-
minants of health, including severe or repeated 
 
exposure to psychosocial adversities such as trauma, 
abuse, socioeconomic disadvantage, discrimination, 
and social isolation. If this is the case, people granted 
refugee status may be particularly vulnerable to psy-
chosis, given their increased likelihood of having expe-
rienced conflict, persecution, violence, or other forms 
of psychosocial adversity.10

Although refugees have more mental health prob-
lems than their non-refugee counterparts,11

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC
Immigrant populations are at elevated risk of schizophrenia and other non-affective 
psychotic disorders
Whether refugees have rates of these disorders over and above those typically 
observed in non-refugee immigrant groups is unclear
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS
The incidence rate of a non-affective psychotic disorder was 66% higher among 
refugees than among non-refugee migrants from similar regions of origin, and 
nearly three times greater than in the native-born Swedish population
These patterns were apparent for men and women, although they were stronger 
in men
Refugees from all regions of origin had higher rates of psychotic disorder than 
non-refugee migrants, except for people from sub-Saharan Africa, for whom rates in 
both groups were similarly high relative to the Swedish-born population
Clinicians and health service planners should be aware of early signs of psychosis in 
vulnerable migrant populations, who may benefit from timely and early interventions

post-traumatic stress disorder and common mental dis-
orders,13 
14  little is known about the risk of psychosis in 
refugees. One previous longitudinal study from 
 
Denmark observed that refugees were at elevated risk of 
psychosis compared with the native-born Danish popu-
lation.15  However, the risk in refugees was not com-
pared with that in other non-refugee migrants 
(henceforth referred to as migrants), who are known to 
be at increased risk,16  making attribution of this excess 
directly to a refugee effect impossible. More recently, a 
Canadian cohort study found that refugees had a mod-
estly increased risk of schizophrenia compared with 
other migrants,17  but neither group was at elevated risk 
compared with an ethnically diverse Canadian-born 
background population, making this finding difficult to 
interpret and contrary to a large literature on immigra-
tion and psychosis.2
Here, we clarify the risk of non-affective psychotic 
disorders, including schizophrenia, in refugees com-
pared with other migrants and the native-born Swedish 
population in a national population based cohort of 1.3 
million people. Sweden has a total population size of 9.7 
million inhabitants, of whom 1.6 million were born 
abroad. In 2011 refugees constituted 12% of the total 
immigrant population. Sweden experienced high levels 
of labour immigration between 1940 and 1970, followed 
by substantial refugee immigration.18  On a per capita 
basis, Sweden grants more refugee applications than 
any other high income country,19 which, combined with 
national linked register data, makes it an excellent set-
ting in which to conduct this research. We hypothesised 
that refugees would have a higher risk of non-affective 
psychotic disorders than migrants and that risk for both 
groups would be elevated compared with the Swed-
ish-born population. We also hypothesised that the risk 
in refugees compared with migrants would vary by 
region of origin, given putative differences in the 
pre-migratory experiences of migrants from different 
regions and differences in how they might adjust to a 
new society.
Methods
Study design and population
We established a retrospective cohort of 1 347 790 peo-
ple born after 1 January 1984, who were born in Sweden 
to two Swedish-born parents (n=1 191 004; 88.4%) or 
were refugees (n=24 123; 1.8%) or non-refugee first gen-
eration migrants (n=132 663; 9.8%) granted residency 
in Sweden. To permit valid comparisons between refu-
gees and migrants, we restricted the immigrant sample 
to people born in geographical regions with at least 
1000 refugees in our cohort (see below). We excluded 
people without an official residence permit in Swe-
den—that is, undocumented migrants or people with 
an official asylum decision pending. We followed par-
ticipants from their 14th birthday, or date of arrival in 
Sweden if later, until diagnosis of an ICD-10 (interna-
tional classification of diseases, 10th revision) non-af-
fective psychotic disorder (F20-29), emigration, death, 
or 31 December 2011, whichever was sooner. We could 
not include people who immigrated to Sweden before 
1 January 1998 (n=53 855), because refugee status was 
not sufficiently recorded in the Swedish national regis-
ters before this date. We also excluded 812 (0.06%) par-
ticipants with missing data on municipality of 
residence in Sweden at cohort entry, needed for estima-
tion of urban residency as a covariate (see below). 
Excluded participants did not differ from immigrants 
included in the cohort by sex (51.0% (27 471/53 855) ver-
sus 50.7% (79 863/157 531) men; χ2 P=0.21) but had a 
higher disposable income (11.0% (5924/53 855) versus 
5.4% (8533/157 531) were in the highest income quarter; 
χ2 P<0.001) and were more likely to come from the for-
mer Yugoslavia (32.4% (17 457/53 855) versus 8.4% 
(13 275/157 531); χ2 P<0.001) than other regions. Crude 
incidence rates were similar between excluded (77.7 
(95% confidence interval 70.4 to 85.8) per 100 000 per-
son years) and included immigrants (86.6 (79.1 to 94.7) 
per 100 000 person years).
Data sources
We extracted data from a large, longitudinal database 
of linked national registers, known as Psychiatry Swe-
den, which included data on all people officially resi-
dent in Sweden after 1 January 1932, linked via a unique 
personal identity number and anonymised by Statistics 
Sweden for research purposes. We obtained relevant 
outcome, exposure, and covariate data from the follow-
ing registers: the register of the total population to iden-
tify cohort participants and obtain basic demographic 
data (birth date, sex, country of birth); the multi-gener-
ation register to link participants to their parents for 
identification of the native-born Swedish population; 
the longitudinal integration database for health insur-
ance and labour market studies (LISA) to obtain data on 
disposable income; the immigration and emigration 
database (STATIV) to obtain migration and refugee 
data; the national patient register to obtain outcome 
data; and the causes of death register for data pertain-
ing to mortality.
Patient involvement
No patients were involved in setting the research ques-
tion or the outcome measures, nor were they involved in 
developing plans for design or implementation of the 
study. No patients were asked to advise on interpreta-
tion or writing up of results. However, we will dissemi-
nate the results of our research to agencies responsible 
for the healthcare of refugee and migrant groups in 
Sweden.
Outcome
Our primary outcome was an ICD-10 clinical diagnosis 
of non-affective psychotic disorder (F20-29), which 
included schizophrenia (F20) and all other non-affec-
tive psychotic disorders (F21-29). We defined cases as 
cohort participants with a first recorded diagnosis 
between 1 January 1998 and 31 December 2011 in the 
national patient register, which records diagnoses fol-
lowing inpatient and outpatient admissions in Sweden 
(including privately run public healthcare settings).

recording from outpatient settings began in 2001. 
We excluded anyone with a recorded diagnosis of 
non-affective psychotic disorder made before the age of 
14 years (n=156).
Exposures
Our primary exposure was refugee status, defined as 
refugee, other migrant, or person born in Sweden to two 
Swedish-born parents, obtained from the STATIV data-
base, which records the reason why a residence permit 
was granted. Permanent residency for asylum in Swe-
den is based on the Swedish Migration Agency’s defini-
tion of refugee status,18  made in accordance with 
Swedish law and the UN Refugee Convention, as some-
one who, “owing to a well-founded fear of being perse-
cuted . . . is unable to, or owing to such fear, is unwilling 
to avail himself of the protection of that country.”20 All 
other immigrants granted official residency were classi-
fied as migrants. We identified people born in Sweden 
to two Swedish-born parents (henceforth the “Swed-
ish-born” group) via linkage to the multi-generation 
register.
As a secondary exposure, we classified people 
according to region of origin, as defined by country of 
birth. Although Statistics Sweden records data on spe-
cific country of birth, information is released for 
research purposes according to 13 larger geographical 
regions to ensure confidentiality. From this variable, we 
derived a broader region of origin variable for analysis, 
which included Sweden (Swedish-born only) and four 
other regions from which at least 1000 refugees in our 
cohort originated—sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, eastern 
Europe and Russia, and the Middle East and north 
Africa (see supplementary table A).
Confounders
We included age at risk and sex as two a priori con-
founder variables in all analyses. We also included indi-
vidual disposable income in Sweden and population 
density at cohort entry as covariates, to adjust for possi-
ble differences between refugees, migrants, and the 
Swedish-born population.
We defined disposable income as annual disposable 
income, based on total family income from all regis-
tered sources, including wages, welfare benefits, other 
social subsidies, and pensions. Statistics Sweden esti-
mated individual disposable income, weighting total 
family income according to household size and compo-
sition, with younger children given lower weights than 
older household members. We measured disposable 
income at the earliest point during follow-up (available 
in LISA at 16 years old or arrival in Sweden, if later). To 
account for inflation, we categorised individual dispos-
able income into quarters, relative to all other cohort 
members assigned a disposable income score in the 
same year.
We defined urban residency according to the popula-
tion density of each participant’s municipality of resi-
dence at cohort entry, expressed as the total population 
per square kilometre (ppkm2 ). Sweden consists of 290 
municipalities (median population density 26.3 
( 
interquartile range 12.2-75.7) ppkm2 ). For descriptive 
purposes, we classified participants into three popula-
tion density categories: 0-26.2 ppkm2  (very rural areas, 
below Swedish median), 26.3-260 ppkm2  (rural and 
semi-rural areas), and 260.1-4617
.2 ppkm2 (metropoli-
tan, suburban, and urban areas). To adjust more effec-
tively for population density, we used a continuous 
measure in our analyses, first transformed on to the 
natural logarithm scale to account for its positive 
skewed distribution across municipalities.
Statistical analyses
We recorded basic descriptive statistics and crude inci-
dence rates for refugees, migrants, and the Swed-
ish-born group. Next, we fitted Cox proportional hazard 
models to estimate hazard ratios and 95% confidence 
intervals according to each exposure variable. Fol-
low-up time was based on the earliest date of entry into 
the risk period (date of 14th birthday or, for all immi-
grants older than 14 years on arrival, date of immigra-
tion) until exit from the cohort. We modelled age at risk 
as a time varying covariate, using Lexis expansion to 
stratify each participant into N observations, taking 
into account differing ages at risk over the follow-up 
period (14-16, 17-19, 20-22, 23-25, 26-27; Nmax=5).
We initially examined the effect of refugee status on 
risk of non-affective psychotic disorder, after adjust-
ment for age at risk, sex, and their interaction, if statis-
tically significant. In a second adjustment, we added 
disposable income and population density. We tested 
whether the relation between refugee status and non-af-
fective disorder differed between men and women by 
fitting an interaction term between refugee status and 
sex, with results presented separately for men and 
women, where appropriate. We repeated these analyses 
for our secondary exposure variable, region of origin. 
Next, to determine whether risk of non-affective psy-
chotic disorder in refugees relative to migrants differed 
by region of origin, we fitted a Cox regression model to 
a subset of the cohort, excluding the Swedish-born 
group who did not contribute information to these anal-
yses. Given the small sample of female refugees diag-
nosed as having psychosis (n=27), we did these analyses 
for both sexes combined and, separately, for men only. 
We assessed all statistical interactions by using likeli-
hood ratio tests against a model without the relevant 
interaction term.
To minimise the possibility that any immigrants diag-
nosed as having non-affective psychotic disorder may 
have been prevalent (that is, existing) cases on arrival 
in Sweden, we did sensitivity analyses on all models, 
excluding any refugee or non-refugee migrant given a 
diagnosis within 12 months of immigration. Finally, we 
checked our main models (via likelihood ratio tests) for 
departure from proportional hazards. We used Stata v13 
to analyse the data.
Results
We identified 3704 cases during more than 8.9 million 
person years of follow-up (table 1). Median age at first 
diagnosis in the Swedish-born population was 20.1 
 on 1 June 2019 by guest. Protected by copyright.

(interquartile range 18.3-22.3) years, younger than for 
refugees (21.0 (19.2-23.7) years; Mann-Whitney P<0.001) 
and non-refugees (20.9 (18.7-23.6) years; P<0.001), for 
whom age at first diagnosis was similar (P=0.30). Fol-
lowing arrival in Sweden, time to first diagnosis was 
shorter for refugees (median 2.8 (0.7-5.6) years) than for 
migrants (3.9 (1.2-7
.0) years; Mann-Whitney P=0.02).
The crude incidence rate of non-affective psychotic 
disorders was 38.5 (95% confidence interval 37
.2 to 39.9) 
per 100 000 person years in the Swedish-born popula-
tion, 80.4 (72.7 to 88.9) per 100 000 person years in 
migrants, and 126.4 (103.1 to 154.8) per 100 000 person 
years in refugees. This corresponded to an absolute rate 
difference of 45.9 (19.0 to 72.9) per 100 000 person years 
in refugees compared with migrants, in addition to an 
extra 41.9 (33.7 to 50.1) cases per 100 000 person years in 
migrants compared with the Swedish-born population. 
Compared with the Swedish-born population, hazard 
ratios were 2.90 (95% confidence interval 2.31 to 3.64) in 
refugees and 1.75 (1.51 to 2.02) in migrants, after adjust-
ment for age, sex, their interaction, disposable income, 
and population density (table 2 ). Refugees were 1.66 
(1.32 to 2.09) times more likely to be diagnosed as hav-
ing non-affective psychotic disorders than were 
migrants. These associations were more pronounced in 
men than women (likelihood ratio test P for interac-
tion=0.001; table 2  and fig 1).
Taking refugees and migrants together, immigrants 
from all regions of origin had increased rates of disorder 
relative to the Swedish-born population, after adjust-
ment for age at risk and sex (supplementary table B). 
Hazard ratios were most pronounced for all immigrants 
from sub-Saharan Africa (hazard ratio 5.23, 4.32 to 
6.34), which was also observed for both men (6.68, 5.33 
to 8.37) and women (3.64, 2.68 to 4.94) separately. These 
patterns persisted after adjustment for disposable 
income and population density, ranging from 1.41 (1.11 
to 1.78) in people from eastern Europe and Russia to 4.10

Model 1 was adjusted for age at risk, sex, and their interaction. Model 2 was also adjusted for disposable income and population density. A likelihood ratio test confirmed statistical interaction 
between sex and age at risk in model 1 (χ2 (df=4) 71.5; P<0.001) and model 2 (χ2 (df=4) 73.0; P<0.001), as well as between sex and refugee status in model 1 (χ2 (df=2) 11.7; P=0.003) and model 
2 (χ2 (df=2) 13.5; P=0.001). Hazard ratios by refugee status are therefore presented separately for men and women.

(3.38 to 4.98) in people from sub-Saharan Africa, rela-
tive to the Swedish-born population.
We next investigated whether the elevated rates of 
non-affective psychotic disorders in refugees compared 
with migrants differed by region of origin, excluding the 
Swedish-born population who did not contribute to 
these analyses. For men and women combined, we 
found evidence that the rate of non-affective psychosis 
in refugees compared with migrants varied by region of 
origin (table 3 ; likelihood ratio test P=0.05). This find-
ing was even more pronounced in men (likelihood ratio 
test P=0.007), such that rates of non-affective psychotic 
disorder were elevated in refugees compared with 
migrants from all regions of origin, except sub-Saharan 
Africa (hazard ratio 0.68, 0.40 to 1.16), after adjustment 
for age at risk, sex, disposable income, and population 
density (table 3 ). Male refugees from eastern Europe 
and Russia were at greatest risk compared with their 
migrant counterparts (hazard ratio 2.88, 1.22 to 6.82). In 
general, the rate of psychotic disorders in refugees 
 
relative to migrants became smaller as the crude inci-
dence rate in non-refugees from each region of origin 
increased (table 3). We made no attempt to examine this 
effect in women, given insufficient numbers of refugees 
(n=27).
Sensitivity analyses excluding potentially prevalent 
cases among immigrants did not appreciably alter esti-
mates of associations for our main exposures (supple-
mentary tables C and D). The assumption of 
proportional hazards was not violated (P=0.84 and 
P=0.13 for analyses of refugee status and region of ori-
gin, respectively).
Discussion
In this cohort study, we found that refugees granted 
asylum in a high income setting were, on average, 66% 
more likely to develop schizophrenia or another non-af-
fective psychotic disorder than non-refugee migrants 
from the same regions of origin and up to 3.6 times more 
likely to do so than the Swedish-born population.
Strengths and weaknesses of study
This study has several methodological strengths. It 
was based on a large, national population based 
cohort of more than 1.3 million people, followed for 
more than 8.9 million person years by using linked 
Swedish register data. This research has not previ-
ously been possible owing to a lack of information on 
the reason for migration in official Swedish registers; 
one earlier attempt to investigate this question in Swe-
den could not distinguish between refugees and 
non-refugees from the same region.21  Swedish register 
data are known to be reliable for research purposes,22 23 
 
and diagnosis of psychotic disorders recorded in the

predictive value.24-26  This register is highly complete, 
recording all psychiatric contacts from inpatient 
 
settings from 1987 onwards and from outpatient set-
tings since 2001. Although this may have led to slight 
under-ascertainment from outpatient settings between 
1998 and 2000, we have no reason to believe that this 
would have introduced differential bias by refugee sta-
tus or region of origin. We cannot exclude the possibil-
ity that we underestimated the true incidence of 
non-affective psychoses in Sweden, particularly for 
certain groups, such as recent immigrants or refugees, 
who may have been unfamiliar with the Swedish 
healthcare system, have faced greater language barri-
ers, or had poor health literacy.27 If these accessibility 
factors differed according to sex, the true incidence 
among migrant and refugee women may have been 
underestimated in the Swedish patient register, mak-
ing our hazard ratios conservative.
Sensitivity analyses suggested that our results were 
not attributable to prevalent cases among refugees and 
migrants. In our study, migrants and refugees from 
sub-Saharan Africa were at increased risk of having a 
psychotic disorder, compared with the Swedish-born 
group. This finding is consistent with many other Euro-
pean and worldwide studies.2  Although diagnostic 
bias has been proposed to explain excess rates of psy-
chotic disorders observed in ethnic minorities,8  little 
evidence supports this possibility in general.28  Studies 
in which psychiatrists were blinded to participants’ 
ethnicity during the diagnostic process have confirmed 
rates of psychotic disorders in ethnic minority groups,29 
 
including people of black Caribbean and black African 
origin. In Sweden, by law, interpreters have to aid clin-
ical consultations when necessary. Furthermore, any 
diagnostic biases are less likely to have accounted for 
observed differences in risk between refugees and 
migrants from the same regions of origin observed in 
our study. Refugees are also at elevated risk of 
post-traumatic stress disorder,13  which can present 
with psychotic features; however, our findings are 
unlikely to be attributable to misdiagnosed cases of 
this disorder among refugees, as it often presents 
comorbidly in people exposed to potentially traumatic 
events and experiences.30
We were unable to include immigrants who arrived in 
Sweden before 1998 in our study, because data on 
 
refugee status were unavailable before that year. These 
groups were more likely to come from the former Yugo-
slavia, reflecting geopolitical conflicts of the time. This 
may have reduced our power to detect differences 
between refugees and other migrants from eastern 
Europe, but we have no reason to believe their exclu-
sion would have otherwise biased our estimates; the 
crude incidence in this group was comparable to that 
for included immigrants, despite their higher post-mi-
gratory disposable income. Finally, notwithstanding 
our large cohort size, the number of cases in refugees 
was small, which limited our power to detect effects in 
certain groups, most notably women, for whom risk of 
non-affective psychotic disorders is, on average, half 
that of men.31
As our study was based on routine register data, 
information on potentially relevant experiences before 
migration was unavailable. Such pre-migratory experi-
ences remain an important area for future research. Our 
cohort included migrants and refugees exposed to vari-
ous humanitarian crises resulting from conflict (such as 
Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, the Balkans, central Africa) as 
well as famine (such as east Africa). Although it is too 
early to determine whether people currently seeking 
refuge in Europe following contemporary humanitarian 
crises (in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, parts of north Africa, 
Kosovo, Albania) would also be at greater risk of psy-
chotic disorder, we assume that our findings will gener-
alise to these groups for two reasons. Firstly, a degree of 
geographical overlap exists between the regions we 
included and those generating current humanitarian 
crises.32 Secondly, we presume that exposure to war, 
persecution, and exposure to other psychosocial adver-
sity would have a universal effect on individual risk of 
psychosis, independent of other risk factors.
We adjusted for possible differences between refu-
gees, migrants, and the Swedish-born population with 
regard to age, sex, disposable income, and population 
density at cohort entry. We did not include other 
post-migratory markers of potential social disadvan-
tage; such factors may lie on the causal pathway 
between immigration and risk psychosis, thus making 
adjustment difficult to interpret. We were unable to 
examine risk of psychosis in so-called second genera-
tion refugees or migrants, because our study population 
was born after 1984, making their children too young to 
have entered the risk period for psychosis before the 
end of our follow-up period in 2011.
Clinical and public health implications of study
Contemporary humanitarian crises in Europe, the Mid-
dle East, north Africa, and central Asia have contrib-
uted to more displaced people, asylum seekers, and 
refugees worldwide than at any time since the second 
world war.33  The severe social, economic, and health 
inequalities faced by displaced populations arising 
from these crises are often compounded by national 
immigration policies and structural constraints in 
receiving countries. In turn, exposure to these ongoing 
adversities seems likely to contribute to the increased 
risk of post-traumatic stress disorder and common 
 
mental disorders among refugees.11-13  Our data high-
light further mental health inequalities facing such 
groups.34 Clinicians and service planners in high 
income settings should be aware of the early signs of 
psychosis in refugees, for whom median presentation to 
services after arrival to Sweden was more than a year 
sooner than for other migrant groups. Just as for the 
general population, refugees and their families will 
benefit from timely and early intervention and care, 
particularly in those exposed to severe psychosocial 
adversity.
Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that 
increased risk of non-affective psychotic disorders 
among immigrants is due to a higher frequency of expo-
sure to social adversity before migration,35  including

the effects of war, violence, or persecution. Further 
studies will be needed to confirm this possibility. 
 
Violence experienced by children and adults who flee 
persecution has been linked to worse subsequent men-
tal health in general.11 36 Intriguingly, our study sug-
gested that risk of psychosis in refugees relative to other 
migrants varied by region of origin in our data. 
Although this finding needs to be replicated in larger 
samples, it suggests that in addition to refugee status, 
context matters. For example, we observed no differ-
ences in risk of psychosis between refugees and non-ref-
ugee migrants among immigrants from sub-Saharan 
Africa, perhaps because both groups had highly 
increased rates of disorder (more than 165 new cases 
per 100 000 person years).
One parsimonious explanation for this finding is that 
a larger proportion of sub-Saharan Africa immigrants 
will have been exposed to deleterious psychosocial 
adversities before emigration, irrespective of refugee 
status. By contrast, pre-migratory psychosocial adversi-
ties experienced by refugees from eastern Europe and 
Russia may differ substantially compared with non-ref-
ugee migrants from these countries, thus confining 
excess risk to refugees from such regions. It is also pos-
sible that post-migratory factors, such as discrimina-
tion, racism, and social exclusion, may explain the high 
rates of psychotic disorder in migrants and refugees 
from sub-Saharan Africa, given the absence of a “refu-
gee effect” in this group. Visible minority status may 
lead to more post-migratory psychosocial adversity. In 
general population samples, some evidence suggests 
that perceived discrimination and ethnic density (prox-
imity to one’s own ethnic group) are, respectively, risk 
and protective factors for psychosis.37 38  Although we 
controlled for income and post-migratory urban resi-
dency, we were unable to investigate other post-migra-
tory factors, including racism, discrimination, and 
ethnic density, in the available data; further explora-
tion of such factors presents an important avenue for 
future research. Other factors, including difficulties in 
the asylum process, also warrant further investigation. 
For example, women seeking asylum are less likely to 
be granted refugee status than men, given greater struc-
tural and cultural barriers in the asylum process.39  In 
our study, such an effect would have led to a higher pro-
portion of women being classified as migrants, which 
may have partially explained why differences in inci-
dence between female refugees and non-refugees were 
less pronounced than for their male counterparts. A 
recent study by Oram et al has further highlighted high 
levels of severe mental illness faced by trafficked 
migrants, who represent another vulnerable group of 
migrants.40
Conclusion
Our study shows that, on average, refugees in a high 
income setting face substantially elevated rates of 
schizophrenia and other non-affective psychoses, in 
addition to the array of other mental, physical, and 
social inequalities that already disproportionately 
affect these vulnerable populations. This risk exceeded 
the well established excess burden of psychosis experi-
enced in immigrant and ethnic minority groups more 
generally and thus emphasises the need to take the 
early signs and symptoms of psychosis into account in 
refugee populations, as part of any clinical mental 
health service responses to the current global humani-
tarian crises. More broadly, our findings support the 
possibility that exposure to psychosocial adversity 
increases the risk of psychosis.
