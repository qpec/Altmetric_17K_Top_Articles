Abstract Antibodies acquired naturally through repeated exposure to Plasmodium falciparum
are essential in the control of blood-stage malaria. Antibody-dependent functions may include
neutralization of parasite–host interactions, complement activation, and activation of Fc receptor
functions. A role of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) by natural killer (NK) cells in
protection from malaria has not been established. Here we show that IgG isolated from adults
living in a malaria-endemic region activated ADCC by primary human NK cells, which lysed infected
red blood cells (RBCs) and inhibited parasite growth in an in vitro assay for ADCC-dependent
growth inhibition. RBC lysis by NK cells was highly selective for infected RBCs in a mixed culture
with uninfected RBCs. Human antibodies to P. falciparum antigens PfEMP1 and RIFIN were
sufficient to promote NK-dependent growth inhibition. As these results implicate acquired
immunity through NK-mediated ADCC, antibody-based vaccines that target bloodstream parasites
should consider this new mechanism of action.

Introduction
Plasmodium falciparum (P. falciparum.), the causative agent of malaria, expresses proteins that are
displayed at the surface of infected red blood cells (RBCs). Some of these proteins promote seques-
tration of P.f.-infected RBCs (iRBCs) through adhesion to vascular endothelial cells (Miller et al.,
2002). Humans living in malaria-endemic areas generate, over years of repeated infections, antibod-
ies (Abs) to P.f. proteins that contribute to the gradual protection from malaria symptoms
(Boyle et al., 2015; Bull and Marsh, 2002; Cohen et al., 1961; Mayor et al., 2015; Tran et al.,
2013). One of the main objectives in malaria research is to define the mechanisms by which naturally
acquired Abs provide protection (Cohen et al., 1961; Crompton et al., 2014). Acquired immunity

 to malaria is complex as it requires a balance of parasite growth inhibition and control of inflamma-
tion (Zhou et al., 2015). Neutralizing Abs that prevent P.f. merozoite invasion of RBCs have been
described (Douglas et al., 2011). However, as merozoites released from late-stage iRBCs rapidly
invade uninfected RBCs (uRBCs), high antibody titers are likely needed for inhibition. Abs bound to
iRBCs promote phagocytosis by myeloid cells, and Abs bound to merozoites activate the comple-
ment pathway (Bouharoun-Tayoun et al., 1995; Boyle et al., 2015; Rowe et al., 1997).
Natural killer (NK) cells constitute about 10% of peripheral blood lymphocytes. They kill virus-
infected cells and tumor cells through engagement of an array of germ-line encoded co-activation
receptors (Bryceson et al., 2006a; Cerwenka and Lanier, 2001). In addition to their innate ability
to eliminate transformed and infected cells, NK cells perform Ab-dependent cellular cytotoxicity
(ADCC) through the low-affinity IgG receptor FcgRIIIa (also known as CD16), thereby killing IgG-
coated target cells and secreting pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IFN-g and TNF-a. A clear role
of NK cells in contributing to protection from malaria, and whether iRBCs could be eliminated
through ADCC by NK cells, has not been established (Wolf et al., 2017). Earlier studies have
described direct lysis of iRBCs by NK cells in the absence of Abs or Ab-dependent inhibition of P.f.
growth by NK cells (Mavoungou et al., 2003; Orago and Facer, 1991). However, other studies
have not confirmed such results (Wolf et al., 2017). Here, we present a detailed study of the activity
of primary, unstimulated human NK cells mixed with RBCs, infected or not by P.f., and evaluate the
NK cell responses using several different quantitative assays. We found that IgG in plasma from sub-
jects living in a malaria-endemic region in Mali bound to iRBCs and induced their rapid lysis through
NK-mediated ADCC. Naturally acquired IgG specific for the major P.f. antigen PfEMP1 was sufficient
to promote NK-dependent inhibition of P.f. growth in RBCs. Our results demonstrated that primary
human NK cells alone are capable of controlling parasite growth in vitro in response to IgG from
subjects exposed to malaria. This may represent an important component of Ab-dependent clinical
immunity to P.f. blood-stage infection that could be exploited in the development of malaria
vaccines.
eLife digest Malaria is a deadly disease caused by a parasite transmitted by mosquitoes. The
parasite infects red blood cells, causing fever with flu-like symptoms. In some people, particularly
pregnant women and children, the disease may be very serious and even lead to death. An effective
malaria vaccine is urgently needed because malaria parasites are developing resistance to current
drugs.
People living in areas where malaria is common develop specific proteins called antibodies that
protect them from malaria. Learning more about how the antibodies achieve this, could help to
develop better vaccines. Scientists already know some antibodies bind to the malaria parasites and
prevent them from entering red blood cells. Some vaccines have been based on these antibodies.
Other antibodies bind to infected cells flagging them for destruction by cells of the immune system.
Immune cells called natural killer cells can eliminate viruses or cancer cells this way, but it was not
clear if they could also eliminate malaria parasite-infected red blood cells.
Now, Arora et al. show that natural killer cells can selectively destroy malaria-infected red blood
cells flagged with antibodies from people who live in areas where malaria is common. In laboratory
experiments, natural killer cells from US volunteers, who were never exposed to malaria, did not kill
normal or malaria-infected red blood cells. Adding antibodies collected from malaria-resistant
volunteers from Africa allowed these natural killer cells from unexposed people to selectively seek
out and destroy malaria-infected cells and leave uninfected red blood cells intact.
Arora et al. also found that the antibodies from the malaria-resistant volunteers bound to parasite
proteins on the surface of infected blood cells. The experiments suggest that vaccines designed to
stimulate the production of antibodies to malaria proteins that are displayed on infected red blood
cells, could destroy the parasite in infected people and help prevent disease and save lives.

 Results
Primary human NK cells are activated by P.f.-infected RBCs in presence
of plasma from malaria-exposed individuals
RBCs infected with P.f. strain 3D7 were enriched for the presence of knobs at the RBC surface (Fig-
ure 1—figure supplement 1A). Knobs are protrusions at the surface of iRBCs that appear at the tro-
phozoite stage. iRBC cultures were enriched for the trophozoite stage by percoll-sorbitol gradient.
Enrichment was confirmed by Giemsa stain (Figure 1—figure supplement 1B). A pool of plasma
from malaria-exposed adults living in a high-transmission region of Mali (Mali plasma) was tested for
the presence of Abs to the surface of P.f. 3D7-iRBCs at the trophozoite stage by flow cytometry.
Adults at the Mali study site are considered ‘semi-immune’ to malaria, as they generally control para-
sitemia and rarely experience malaria symptoms (Tran et al., 2013). Abs in Mali plasma stained
iRBCs but not uRBCs (Figure 1A). In contrast, Abs in a pool of serum from malaria-naı
¨ve US adults
(US serum) did not bind to iRBCs any more than they did to uRBCs (Figure 1A). Binding of Abs in
Mali plasma to iRBCs was confirmed by immunofluorescence microscopy (Figure 1B). Lower magnifi-
cation images of mixed uRBCs and iRBCs showed that staining by Mali plasma was selective for
iRBCs (Figure 1—figure supplement 1C).
We tested the reactivity of primary NK cells, freshly isolated from the blood of healthy malaria-
naı
¨ve US donors, to iRBCs in the absence of Abs. NK cells did not degranulate during co-incubation
with iRBCs, as monitored by staining with anti-LAMP-1 (CD107a) Ab (Figure 1C and D). As binding
of FcgRIIIA to IgG alone is sufficient to induce activation of resting NK cells (Bryceson et al., 2005),
IgG bound to RBCs has the potential to induce NK cell degranulation and cytokine production. We
first tested stimulation of NK cells in the presence of a polyclonal serum of rabbits that had been
immunized with human RBCs. Degranulation by NK cells occurred during incubation with iRBCs in
the presence of rabbit anti-RBC Abs (Figure 1C and D). Notably, potent NK cell degranulation
occurred with iRBCs in the presence of Mali plasma, whereas US serum induced degranulation in a
very small fraction of NK cells (Figure 1C and D). NK cell expression of intracellular interferon (IFN)-
g and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a was also stimulated equally well by rabbit anti-RBC serum and
Mali plasma, whereas US serum did not induce cytokine production (Figure 1E and F and Figure 1—
figure supplement 1D). These results suggested that Abs from malaria-exposed individuals activate
NK cells when bound to iRBCs, which results in NK cell degranulation and production of cytokines.
Selective lysis of P.f.-infected RBCs by primary NK cells in the presence
of plasma from malaria-exposed individuals
We next investigated whether NK cells could selectively lyse Ab-coated iRBCs without causing
bystander lysis of uRBCs. uRBCs and iRBCs were labeled with either eFluor450 or eFluor670 dyes,
which bind cellular proteins containing primary amines, and NK cells were labeled with the lipophilic
dye PKH67. The three cell types were incubated together at equal numbers, and examined by live
microscopy. Images were acquired in a temperature-controlled chamber every 30 s for several hours
(Videos 1 and 2). Representative images taken at 0, 2, and 4 hr are shown in Figure 2A. Quantita-
tive analysis of cell numbers, which were determined every minute, showed that all three cell types
remained at a constant ratio when incubated with US serum (Figure 2B, left panel). In contrast, NK
cells selectively lysed iRBCs in the presence of Mali plasma, leaving uRBCs intact (Figure 2B, right
panel). A compilation of four experiments, each performed with NK cells from a different donor,
showed iRBC lysis induced by Mali plasma but not US serum (Figure 2C, left panel), and selective
lysis of iRBCs in the presence of Mali plasma (Figure 2C, right panel). The relative change in the fre-
quency of uRBCs and iRBCs over 3 hr in the presence of US serum or Mali plasma is shown in Vid-
eos 1 and 2. We concluded that lysis of P.f.-iRBCs by NK cells in the presence of plasma from
malaria-exposed individuals was efficient and specific, causing minimal bystander lysis of uRBCs.
NK cells inhibit P.f. growth in RBCs in the presence of IgG from malaria-
exposed individuals
The fraction of RBCs invaded by merozoites (also known as parasitemia) in P.f.-infected individuals
typically ranges from 0.005 to 5% (Gonc
¸alves et al., 2014). We tested the ability of NK cells to
inhibit parasite growth in an RBC culture that was set at 1% parasitemia. As the ratio of NK cells to

 iRBCs was set at 3:1 and 1:1, NK cells were out-
numbered by a 30 to 100 fold excess of uRBCs
during incubation. Cultures were maintained for
48 hr before analysis (Figure 2—figure supple-
ment 1A). Given that iRBC cultures were synchro-
nized at the ring stage and enriched at the
trophozoite-stage, a single round of RBC rupture
and reinvasion of fresh RBCs by released mero-
zoites occurred in the next ~18 hr. P.f. growth
was determined by counting iRBCs in blood
smears. In the absence of Abs, growth inhibition
was

±
11.53%
at
an
E:T
ratio
of
3
(Figure 2D). A similar result was obtained in the
presence
of
US
serum
(4.33
±
12.15%;
Figure 2D). In contrast, in the presence of Mali
plasma, inhibition of parasite growth was 62.56 ±
15.41% at an E:T ratio of 3 (Figure 2D). Strong
growth inhibition occured also at an E:T ratio of 1
(Figure 2D). A much reduced inhibition occurred
with Mali plasma in the absence of NK cells
(11.55 ± 1.99%), which could be due to Ab-medi-
ated inhibition of merozoite reinvasion. We con-
cluded that NK cells, in the presence of plasma
from malaria-exposed individuals, are capable of inhibiting blood-stage P.f. growth even in the pres-
ence of a 100-fold excess of uRBCs. The results further suggested that maturation of trophozoites
and schizonts into infectious merozoites was inhibited by NK-mediated ADCC toward iRBCs.
The standard growth inhibition assay (GIA) (Malkin et al., 2005) was modified to remove Abs
that inhibit P.f. growth through neutralization of merozoites. NK cells were first co-incubated with
trophozoite-enriched iRBCs for 6 hr, in the presence or absence of Mali plasma. Cultures were then
washed to remove unbound Abs and soluble factors prior to addition of a 100-fold excess of fresh
uRBCs. Cultures were further incubated for 16 hr to allow for a single round of merozoite release
and reinvasion of uRBCs (Figure 2—figure supplement 1B). We refer to this assay for inhibition by
NK-mediated ADCC as GIA-ADCC. Parasitemia at the end of the experiment was determined by
flow-cytometry (Figure 2—figure supplement
1C). Inhibition of P.f. growth occurred in the
presence of Mali plasma but not in the presence
of US serum (Figure 2E). These results showed
that inhibition of P.f. growth was due to Abs
bound to iRBCs prior to the release of mero-
zoites and the addition of uRBCs, confirming the
role of NK cell-mediated ADCC.
As NK cell-mediated ADCC triggered by
FcgRIIIa is dependent on binding to IgG, we
tested whether IgG in Mali plasma was sufficient
to promote NK-dependent inhibition of P.f.
growth. IgG purified from US serum did not bind
to uRBCs (Figure 2—figure supplement 1D) or
to trophozoite-stage iRBCs (Figure 2F), whereas
IgG purified from Mali plasma bound to iRBCs
(Figure 2F) but not uRBCs (Figure 2—figure
supplement 1D). In the GIA-ADCC, designed to
exclude merozoite neutralization as the basis for
inhibition, purified IgG from Mali plasma inhib-
ited P.f. growth (37.59 ± 12.15% inhibition at an
IgG concentration of 1.8 mg/ml) (Figure 2G). No
inhibition was observed with IgG purified from

 US serum (Figure 2G). The use of purified IgG eliminated the possibility that the difference observed
between Mali and US individuals was due to properties unique to human plasma that were absent in
human serum. These results demonstrated that IgG from malaria-exposed individuals promotes inhi-
bition of P.f. growth in RBCs in the presence of NK cells.
PfEMP1 is a major target of naturally acquired antibodies that induce
NK-dependent lysis of iRBCs
The P.f. erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1), which mediates parasite sequestration through
binding to vascular endothelial cells, is a major target of host Ab responses (Bull and Marsh, 2002;
Chan
et
al.,
2012).
We
used
the
parasite
line
DC-J,
which
lacks
PfEMP1
expression
(Dzikowski et al., 2006), to test the importance of PfEMP1 in promoting Ab-dependent NK cell acti-
vation. Staining of P.f. DC-J-iRBCs with Mali plasma gave a positive signal that was approximately
one log less than staining of 3D7-iRBCs (Figure 3A), but greater than staining of P.f. DC-J-iRBCs
with US serum (Figure 3B). Time-lapse imaging was used to monitor lysis of DC-J-iRBCs by NK cells
in the presence of Mali plasma during co-incubation with an equal number of uRBCs (Figure 3C). NK
cells did not lyse DC-J-iRBCs in the presence of Mali plasma (Video 3). Data from four experiments
with NK cells from different donors indicated no significant decrease in iRBCs in the presence of
Mali plasma compared to US serum over the course of 3 hr (Figure 3D). Therefore, residual Ab-bind-
ing in the absence of PfEMP1 (Figure 3A) was not sufficient, under the conditions used, to promote
NK-mediated ADCC in the presence of Mali plasma.
We wanted to test whether the lack of lysis of P.f. DC-J-iRBCs by NK cells could perhaps be due
to an intrinsic resistance of DC-J to NK-mediated lysis. To test it we used the rabbit anti-serum
raised against human RBCs, which activated degranulation by NK cells in the presence of 3D7-iRBCs
(Figure 1C and D). We further developed a quantitative RBC lysis assay based on hemoglobin (Hb)
release into the supernatant. Maximum Hb release from RBCs was defined as Hb in detergent
lysates of RBCs (Figure 3—figure supplement 1A). This control also served to compensate for the
loss of Hb during P.f. development in RBCs, as the parasite digests some of the Hb to produce
hemozoin. Severe damage to RBCs, as determined by Hb release, occurred at NK cell to RBC ratios
of 3:1 and 10:1, after a 5 hr incubation with 3D7-iRBCs in the presence of rabbit anti-RBC Abs (Fig-
ure 3—figure supplement 1B and Figure 3—figure supplement 1C). At an NK cell to iRBC ratio of
5:1, 47.16 ± 8.76% of total Hb content was released (Figure 3E). The timing of eukaryotic evolution

with a 100-fold excess of uRBCs (relative to the iRBC input). Inhibition is expressed as a percent decrease in

 13.1% of total Hb content was released (Figure 3E). We concluded that uRBCs and 3D7 P.f.-iRBCs
were equally sensitive to NK-mediated ADCC.
This approach gave us an opportunity to test whether DC-J-iRBCs were inherently resistant to
NK-mediated ADCC. Lysis assays in the presence of rabbit anti-RBC Abs and NK cells were per-
formed. The extent of Hb release (52.66 ± 11.34%) after incubation at an NK cell to DC-J-iRBC ratio
of 5:1 for 5 hr was comparable to that obtained with uRBCs and 3D7-iRBCs (Figure 3E). Hemoglobin
release in the absence of rabbit anti-human RBC Abs was minimal. Therefore, we concluded that the
lack of lysis of DC-J-iRBCs in the presence of Mali plasma was not due to resistance to NK-depen-
dent ADCC, but rather to the low amount of Abs bound to RBCs infected with this PfEMP1-deficient
parasite strain. Together, these data suggested that naturally acquired Abs to PfEMP1 play a critical
role in NK cell-mediated destruction of iRBCs.
The FcgRIIIa binding site of human IgG1 Fc is required for NK-
dependent lysis of P.f.-infected RBCs
Abs with broad reactivity against certain members of the RIFIN family of P.f. proteins have recently
been cloned from memory B cells of malaria-exposed individuals in Kenya, Mali and Tanzania
(Pieper et al., 2017; Tan et al., 2016). Similar to PfEMP1, RIFIN is a type of variant antigen
expressed on the surface of iRBCs. Using a P.f. 3D7 strain enriched for expression of RIFIN
(Figure 4A), we tested NK-dependent lysis of
RIFIN+ iRBCs in the presence of the RIFIN-spe-
cific
human
monoclonal
Ab
MGD21.
Lysis
occurred during incubation with NK cells at an
NK cell to iRBC ratio of 5:1 for 6 hr, as measured
by Hb release (Figure 4B). Negligible lysis was
observed in the absence of NK cells or in the
absence of MGD21. We then tested a variant of
monoclonal Ab MGD21 (MGD21-LALA), into
which mutations had been introduced in the Fc
to reduce binding to Fc receptors (Tan et al.,
2016). Staining of iRBCs indicated that MGD21
and MGD21-LALA bound similarly to RIFIN+
iRBCs (Figure 4A). However, in the presence of
NK cells, only MGD21, and not MGD21-LALA,
induced Hb release (Figure 4B), demonstrating
that an
intact
Fc receptor-binding
site
was
required for NK cell stimulation. In addition, we
concluded that P.f. antigens other than PfEMP1
have the potential to induce NK-dependent
ADCC in the presence of specific Abs.The timing

 Naturally acquired human IgG specific for pregnancy-associated
VAR2CSA antigen promotes NK-dependent lysis of infected RBCs
To further define antigenic epitopes with the potential to induce NK-dependent ADCC toward P.f.-
iRBCs, we tested polyclonal, affinity-purified IgG from rabbits that had been immunized with the
Duffy binding-like 3x (DBL3X) domain of the PfEMP1 variant VAR2CSA (Obiakor et al., 2013). This
rabbit IgG stained VAR2CSA-iRBCs, as measured by flow cytometry (Figure 4C). The VAR2CSA-spe-
cific rabbit IgG, but not control rabbit serum IgG, induced Hb release from VAR2CSA-iRBCs after
incubation with NK cells (Figure 4D). Uninfected RBCs were not lysed in the presence of VAR2CSA-
specific rabbit IgG (Figure 4—figure supplement 1A). These results showed that domain DBL3X
was accessible to Abs at the surface of VAR2CSA-iRBCs, and oriented in such a way that bound Abs
could engage FcgRIIIA on NK cells.
To test the potential of naturally acquired Abs to VAR2CSA PfEMP1 to promote NK-dependent
inhibition of P.f. growth in RBCs, we used human IgG isolated from pooled plasma of multigravid
women, and affinity-purified on DBL domains of VAR2CSA PfEMP1 (Doritchamou et al., 2016). This
natural IgG stained VAR2CSA-iRBCs, as measured by flow cytometry, whereas human IgG Abs
against another parasite antigen, AMA1, did not (Figure 4E). NK cells were incubated with tropho-
zoite-stage enriched RBCs infected by P.f. VAR2CSA for 6 hr in the presence of IgG Abs. A 100-fold
excess of uRBCs was added and incubation resumed for 42 hr. In the presence of naturally acquired
human IgG specific for VAR2CSA PfEMP1, P.f. growth was inhibited by 49.88 ± 8.49%, which was
similar to inhibition obtained with rabbit anti-DBL3X IgG (60 ± 11.29%) (Figure 4F, Figure 4—figure
supplement 1B). No inhibition was observed in the absence of NK cells (Figure 4—figure supple-
ment 1C). These results showed that naturally acquired Abs to PfEMP1 induce NK-mediated ADCC,
which inhibits parasite growth in RBCs.
Discussion
The main objective of our study was to test whether NK cells could help control blood-stage malaria
by lysing iRBCs through ADCC. Considering the essential role of Abs in conferring clinical immunity
to individuals living in areas of high P.f. transmission (Cohen et al., 1961), and the limited efficacy of
malaria vaccines tested so far, any immune effector function that depends on Abs needs to be evalu-
ated. We provide strong evidence of Ab-dependent NK cell cytotoxicity towards P.f.-iRBCs in the
presence of Abs from malaria-exposed individuals in Mali. NK cell responses to iRBCs and their
effect on P.f. growth in culture were tested using primary, unstimulated human NK cells. NK cells iso-
lated from the blood of individuals in the US were used. It is possible that NK cells from individuals
exposed to malaria may have altered function, or a reduced cell frequency, as reported following a
controlled human malaria infection (Mpina et al., 2017). Lysis of iRBCs by NK cells, in the presence
of Abs to P.f. antigens exposed at the surface of iRBCs, was highly selective, leaving most uRBCs
intact. NK cell-mediated ADCC inhibited P.f. growth in RBC cultures. Human Abs specific for a single
class of P.f. antigens expressed at the surface of RBCs, such as PfEMP1 and RIFIN, were sufficient to
induce NK cell cytotoxicity and P.f. growth inhibition. We propose that NK-dependent ADCC may

Enriched trophozoite-stage FCR3 VAR2CSA-iRBCs were incubated with NK cells, at an NK to iRBC ratio of 5 for 6
hr, in the presence of a control rabbit IgG (–), of rabbit anti-PfEMP1 IgG, and of human anti-PfEMP1 IgG, as
indicated. A 100-fold excess of uRBCs (relative to the iRBCs input) was added, and incubation resumed for another
42 hr. Inhibition is expressed as percent decrease in parasitemia relative to iRBCs that were incubated with NK
cells in the absence of Abs (ANOVA, p=0.0027).

 be an effective mechanism to limit parasite growth, as it combines the powerful cytotoxicity of
innate NK cells with the specificity of Abs generated by adaptive immunity.
RIFIN antigens may help P.f. evade immune detection by binding to inhibitory receptors on
human lymphocytes (Saito et al., 2017). However, we observed hemoglobin release after mixing NK
cells with RIFIN+ P.f.-infected RBCs in the presence of a human monoclonal Ab to RIFIN. NK cell acti-
vation was not due to the masking of RIFIN by the monoclonal Ab (and release from inhibition) but
to activation of ADCC by the human IgG1 mAb because the same antibody lacking FcR binding did
not activate NK cells.
The developmental cycle of P.f. in iRBCs provides a window of opportunity for Ab-dependent
immune effector responses. Following merozoite invasion of RBCs, P.f. proteins begin to appear at
the RBC surface after 16–20 hr and remain exposed until infectious merozoites are released. Once
released, merozoites rapidly invade fresh RBCs (Boyle et al., 2010). Therefore, it is likely that high
Ab titers are needed to neutralize merozoites and block entry into RBCs. In contrast, RBCs harboring
non-infectious P.f., as it progresses through trophozoite and schizont stages, display P.f. antigens at
their surface for more than 24 hr, and ADCC responses activated by FcgRIIIa in primary human NK
cells are rapid, strong and independent of coactivation signals (Bryceson et al., 2005).
Evidence of NK cell activation and RBC lysis was obtained with three different assays: (1) NK cell
degranulation and cytokine production by flow cytometry, (2) loss of intact P.f.-iRBCs by live imag-
ing, and (3) RBC lysis by measurement of Hb release. NK cell degranulation in a co-culture with P.f.-
iRBCs, selectively induced by Abs from malaria-exposed individuals, was just as strong as that
obtained with rabbit polyclonal antiserum raised against human RBCs. Furthermore, using Hb-
release assays and rabbit anti-RBC serum, it was possible to show that iRBCs are not inherently
more resistant or sensitive than uRBCs to NK-mediated lysis. Live imaging of a coculture of NK cells,
uRBCs and P.f.-iRBCs, in the presence of plasma from malaria-exposed individuals, revealed selec-
tive lysis of iRBCs, with no ’bystander’ lysis of uRBCs.
Natural cytotoxicity of NK cells towards P.f.-iRBCs was not detected in our assays with resting NK
cells. A recent study in humanized mice reconstituted with human lymphocytes and injected with P.
f.-infected human RBCs, reported some lysis of P.f.-iRBCs by NK cells (Chen et al., 2014). It is possi-
ble that under specific stimulatory conditions, including soluble factors and contact with other cells,
human NK cells exhibit natural cytotoxic responses towards P.f.-iRBCs. However, considering that
clinical immunity to malaria depends in large part on Abs, and that development of an effective vac-
cine is a high priority, we chose to focus on ADCC by NK cells. Signaling in NK cells by FcgRIIIa
alone, independently of other co-activation signals and of integrin-dependent adhesion, is sufficient
to induce strong responses, unlike other NK activation receptors, which require synergy through
combinations of co-activation receptors (Bryceson et al., 2005; 2006b). The Ab-mediated activation
of NK cell cytotoxicity described here is adding a strong effector mechanism to the other mecha-
nisms by which Abs may confer protection against malaria, including neutralizing Abs and Abs that
activate the complement pathway (Boyle et al., 2015).
We have shown that NK cell-mediated ADCC inhibits the growth of P.f. in RBC cultures in the
presence of Abs to P.f. antigens expressed at the surface of iRBCs in a standard growth inhibition
assay (GIA) by co-incubation of iRBCs and NK cells with a large excess of uRBCs. To distinguish inhi-
bition by NK cells from other Ab-dependent functions, such as merozoite neutralization and activa-
tion of complement, we developed a two-step GIA to evaluate inhibition that had occurred prior to
iRBC rupture and reinvasion of fresh RBCs. As inhibition of P.f. growth occurred in the presence of
purified IgG from plasma of malaria-exposed individuals, other serum components were not
required for NK-mediated inhibition. The modified GIA for ADCC could help define P.f. antigens
that induce Abs of sufficient titer and quality for FcR activation (e.g. IgG isotype, glycosylation). The
GIA-ADCC is well-suited to large screens of plasma from subjects in malaria vaccine trials or in stud-
ies of naturally acquired immunity to malaria.
Previous work has shown that IL-2 produced by T cells following malaria infection or injection of a
malaria vaccine activates IFN-g production by NK cells (Wolf et al., 2017). In addition, P.f. infection
activates IL-18 secretion by macrophages. Through IL-18 and direct contact with macrophages NK
cells are activated to produce IFN-g (Baratin et al., 2005; Wolf et al., 2017). In contrast, the effector
functions of NK cells we describe here are independent of external signals, since unstimulated pri-

 blood, without stimulation prior to incubation with RBCs and Abs. In summary, we have shown that
human NK cells have the potential to control P.f. parasitemia through IgG-dependent activation of
NK cellular cytotoxicity, and thus contribute to protection from blood-stage malaria.

 Study approval
This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Medicine, Pharmacy, and Den-
tistry at the University of Sciences, Techniques, and Technologies of Bamako, in Mali and by the
Institutional Review Board of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Insti-
tutes of Health. Prior to inclusion in this study, written informed consent was received from
participants.
Antibody sources
Plasma samples were collected from adults enrolled in a multi-year malaria study in the rural village
Kambila (Crompton et al., 2008), by starting with venous blood collected in citrate-containing cell-
preparation tubes (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Samples were transported 45 km away to the Malaria
Research and Training Centre in Bamako, where peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and
plasma were isolated. Plasma was frozen in 1 ml aliquots at �80˚C. Samples were shipped to the
United States on dry ice for analysis. Control serum from US individuals was obtained from Valley
Biomedical (Winchester, VA).
Enrichment of antibody
IgG was purified from plasma or serum by standard affinity chromatography. Briefly, each sample
was diluted 1:5 in column equilibration-wash buffer (10 mM NaPO4, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.0). The IgG
fraction was isolated on Protein G columns (GE Healthcare, Amersham-Pharmacia-HiTrap Protein G)
and eluted with 100 mM glycine, pH 2.5. and immediately neutralized to pH 7.4 with 4.0 M Tris pH
8.0. IgG was concentrated and dialyzed in Pall Macrosep columns (30 kDa MW cutoff) with PBS.
NK cell isolation
Human blood samples from deidentified healthy US donors were drawn for research purposes at the
NIH Blood Bank under an NIH IRB approved protocol with informed consent. PBMCs were first iso-
lated using Lymphocyte Separation Medium (MP Biomedicals, Solon, OH), washed with PBS twice,
and resuspended in PBS, with 2% FBS and 1 mM EDTA. NK cells were isolated from PBMCs by
depletion of non-NK cells using an NK cell isolation kit (STEMCELL Technologies, Cambridge, MA).
The manufacturer’s protocol was modified as follows. PBMCs were resuspended at 2 � 108, per ml
and 2.5 ml/ml of anti-CD3 biotin (STEMCELL Technologies) was added to the 50 ml/ml of the non-NK
cocktail to increase NK cell purity. Resting NK cells were resuspended in Iscove’s modified Dulbec-
co’s medium (IMDM; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 10% human serum (Valley Bio-
medical, Winchester, VA), and were used within 1 to 4 days after isolation. Only NK cell preparations
that had greater than 95% CD14neg, CD3neg, CD56pos, as determined by flow cytometry, were
used in experiments.
Cultivation and purification of P. falciparum
3D7 and FCR3 VAR2CSA strains were cultivated at 37˚C under 5% O2, 5% CO2, 90% N2 at 37˚C
at <5% hematocrit using O+ human erythrocytes (Interstate Blood Bank, Inc.). The P.f. DC-J strain
was cultivated similarly in the presence of Blasticidin (2.5 mg/ml). Parasites were cultured in complete
medium, which was RPMI 1640 buffered with 25 mM HEPES and supplemented with 2.5% heat-inac-
tivated human AB Serum, 0.5% Albumax-II, 28 mM sodium bicarbonate, 25 mg/ml gentamycin, and
50 mg/ml hypoxanthine. Parasite development was monitored by light microscopy using methanol-
fixed, Giemsa-stained thin blood films. Parasites were synchronized using sorbitol (Lambros and
Vanderberg, 1979). Parasite-iRBCs were enriched for knobs using Zeptogel (contains gelatin) sedi-
mentation routinely. Infected RBCs used in ADCC assays were enriched at the trophozoite stage
with percoll-sorbitol gradient and centrifugation (Aley et al., 1984; Hill et al., 2007), washed, and
resuspended in complete medium in the absence of human serum. Cultures growing in Albumax-II
therefore had no antibodies or complement components.
Immunostaining and immunofluorescence analysis
iRBCs, enriched at the trophozoite stage, were resuspended in PBS and 2% FBS, and incubated at
4˚C for 30 min with plasma, serum, or purified antibodies at specified dilutions. Cells were washed
and incubated at 4˚C with appropriate and fluorescently-tagged secondary Abs for an additional 20

 min. Cells were washed, and flow cytometry was performed on a FACS LSR-II or a FACS Calibur (BD
Biosciences), and data analyzed with FlowJo (FlowJo, LLC). For immunofluorescence analysis, iRBCs,
enriched at the trophozoite stage, were mixed with uRBCs at a ratio of 1:1 and incubated with US
serum or Mali plasma for 30 min at 4˚C. Cells were washed and incubated with fluorescently –tagged
secondary Abs for an additional 20 min. Cells were first washed, and then fixed with 1% paraformal-
dehyde (PFA) at room temperature. DAPI was used to visualize the P.f. DNA in iRBCs. Immunofluo-
rescence images were obtained on a LSM 780 confocal laser microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen,
Germany). Images were acquired using the Zen software (Carl Zeiss).
Scanning electron microscopy
uRBCs and iRBCs were washed with 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). RBCs were centrifuged at
2500 rpm for 5 min and supernatants were removed. RBCs were again washed with 0.1 M phosphate
buffer (pH 7.4). RBCs were resuspended in 3 ml of fixative solution (3% PFA +0.1% glutaraldehyde).
The cells were stored at 4˚C until further processing for imaging. Fixed cells were allowed to settle
on silicon chips for 1 hr. Subsequent post-fixation with 1% OsO4 was performed with microwave irra-
diation (Pelco 3451 microwave processor, in cycles of 2 min on, 2 min off, 2 min on at 250 W under
15 in. Hg vacuum; Ted Pella, Redding, CA). Specimens were dehydrated in a graded ethanol series
for 1 min under vacuum. Samples were then dried to a critical point in a Bal-Tec cpd 030 drier
(Balzer, Bal-Tec AG, Balzers, Liechtenstein). Cells were then coated with 75 A
˚ of iridium in an IBS ion
beam sputter (South Bay Technology, Inc., San Clemente, CA.) Samples were imaged on a Hitachi
SU-8000 SEM (Hitachi, Pleasantown, CA).
Degranulation and intracellular cytokine assays
Resting NK cells (2 � 105) either alone or mixed with enriched iRBCs (2 � 105) were added to wells
of a 96-well plate, in the presence of antibodies (either US serum diluted 1:10, Mali plasma diluted
1:10, or rabbit anti-human RBC antibody at 1.25 mg/ml). Anti-CD107a Ab–PE diluted 1:20 (Clone
H4A3, Cat#555801, BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ) was added at the beginning of the incuba-
tion with NK cells. Cells were centrifuged for 3 min at 100 g and incubated for 4 hr at 37˚C. Cells
were centrifuged, resuspended in PBS containing 2% FBS, and stained with conjugated anti-CD56–
PC5.5 Ab (Clone N901, Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA), near-IR fixable Live/Dead dye (Invitrogen), and
CD235a–FITC (Clone H1264, Biolegend, San Diego, CA). Samples were analyzed on a FACS-LSRII
flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and data analyzed with FlowJo software (FlowJo, LLC). For intracel-
lular cytokine assays, NK cells were incubated with iRBCs as described above in the presence of Bre-
feldin A (5 mg/ml) during the 4 hr incubation. Cells were then stained with anti-CD56–PC5.5 Ab
(Clone N901, Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA), near-IR fixable Live/Dead dye (Invitrogen), CD235a–FITC
(Clone H1264, Biolegend, San Diego, CA), followed by fixation and permeabilization using the BD
Cytofix/Cytoperm Kit (BD Biosciences). IFN-g was detected using anti-IFN-g–APC Ab (Clone B27, BD
Biosciences) and TNF-a was detected using anti-TNF-a–PE Ab (Clone 6401.1111, BD Bioscience).
Samples were resuspended in PBS and analyzed on a FACS LSRII flow cytometer (BD Biosciences).
Data analysis was performed with FlowJo software (FlowJo, LLC).
Time-lapse imaging
NK cells, uRBCs and iRBCs were washed twice with PBS before labeling with different dyes. iRBCs
were stained with cell proliferation dye eFluor 670 at 5 mM for 5 min in PBS at 37˚C. Similarly, uRBCs
were stained with eFluor 450 dye at 2.5 mM concentration for 5 min in PBS at 37˚C. NK cells were
washed, suspended in diluent C and stained with 1 mM PKH67 membrane dye (PKH67 green fluores-
cent green linker kit, Sigma-Aldrich) for 5 min at 37˚C. Cells were then washed three times with
media containing serum (e.g., RPMI with 10% FBS). For imaging, cells were resuspended in RPMI
1640 containing 0.5% Albumax-II in the absence of Phenol Red. Cells were added in 8-well Lab-Tek I
Chambered cover glass (Nunc) and allowed to settle for 15 min. Imaging was performed with a Zeiss
LSM 780 confocal microscope while maintaining incubation condition at 37˚C, 5% CO2, in a humidi-
fied chamber. Images were acquired at 30 s interval for 6 hr. Time-lapse image stacks were imported
into the Imaris software. A threshold algorithm eliminated background noise from each channel, and
a Gaussian filter was applied to smooth the texture, and to easily segment the regions of interest
(ROIs). After filtering, a surface channel was created from each color channel for each cell

 population, with surface threshold based on intensity. The surface generator was set to run a water-
shed algorithm. The seed-points diameter was set to 4.5 mm for iRBCs and uRBCs, and 6.0 mm for
NK cells. In order to weed out unwanted particles that passed the intensity threshold, a surface ROI
was considered to be one with voxel size greater than 110 voxels. For the tracking algorithm we
used autoregressive motion with maximum step distance set to 5 mm and maximum gap size set to
two frames.
Growth inhibition assay (GIA)
NK cells were incubated with 20 � 103 trophozoite-stage iRBCs at NK to iRBC ratios of 1:1 and 3:1
in the presence of 20 � 105 uRBCs in 96-well plates for 48 hr at 37˚C, in complete medium. Thin
blood smears were fixed in 100% methanol, stained with 5% Giemsa solution and counted under
light microscope. 25 microscope fields, each containing 200 RBCs, were counted. Parasitemia was
expressed as [(number of iRBCs � total number of RBCs)�100]. 2.5 � 105 NK cells and 5 � 104
FCR3 VAR2CSA–iRBCs were mixed in 96-well plates and incubated for 6 hr at 37˚C in the absence
or presence of purified rabbit IgG antibodies to the DBL3X domain (0.5 mg/ml), or purified human
IgG antibodies to the DBL domains of PfEMP1 VAR2CSA (0.5 mg/ml), or control rabbit IgG (0.5 mg/
ml) in a final volume of 25 ml. A 100-fold excess of uRBCs (5 � 106) was then added, bringing the
final volume to 100 ml. Cultures were then maintained for an additional 42 hr at 37˚C in standard par-
asite growth conditions. At the end of incubation, CD45-PE (Clone H130, Biolegend, San Diego, CA)
and CD235a-FITC antibodies, and Hoechst were used to stain NK cells, uRBCs and iRBCs. Samples
were acquired on FACSLSR-II, and data analyzed with FlowJo (FlowJo, LLC). Parasitemia was deter-
mined as the fraction of RBCs (CD235a+) positive for Hoechst. Samples with NK cells but in the
absence of antibodies were used as control to calculate growth inhibition.
GIA-ADCC assay
NK cells and iRBCs were resuspended in experimental media (no human serum). 6 � 105 NK cells
and 2 � 105 iRBCs were mixed at a 3:1 ratio in 96-well plates and incubated for 6 hr at 37˚C in the
absence or presence of antibodies. For experiments using plasma or serum, the total amount of
plasma or serum in each condition was (20 ml plasma/serum into 200 ml media) to control for the
level of plasma. 20 ml of US serum the negative control, then increasing volume of Mali immune
plasma was added in (Example: 2 ml Mali plasma with 18 ml US serum totaling 20 ml plasma/serum).
After a 6 hr coincubation of iRBCs and NK cells, soluble Abs were removed by a wash. This washing
step removed any antibody that would bind to merozoites. A 100-fold excess of uRBCs (2 � 107) rel-
ative to iRBCs was then added and cultures were maintained for an additional 16 hr at 37˚C in stan-
dard parasite growth conditions. At the end of incubation, CD45- PE (BD Biosciences), CD235a-
FITC, and Hoechst were used to stain NK cells, uRBCs and iRBCs (Figure 2—figure supplement
1C). Samples with NK cells but in the absence of antibodies were used as control to calculate growth
inhibition.
Hemoglobin release assay
Enriched iRBCs and NK cells were washed with RPMI 1640, containing 0.5% Albumax in the absence
of Phenol red. Cells were mixed at defined ratios in 96-well V bottom plates in 150 ml. Antibodies
were added as specified. Antibodies tested in the assay are Rabbit anti-human RBC antibodies (1.25
mg/ml), MGD21 and MGD21-LALA antibodies (Tan et al., 2016) (0.2 mg/ml), Rabbit VAR2CSA and
Control IgG antibodies (0.5 mg/ml). Cells were centrifuged at 100 g for 3 min and incubated at 37˚C
for 5–6 hr as mentioned. Plates were centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 5 min and 50 ml of supernatant
was collected. Hemoglobin was measured with QuantiChrom Hemoglobin Assay Kit (BioAssay, Hay-
ward, CA). Hemoglobin absorbance was measured at 405 nm using a 96-well plate reader (Enspire,
Perkin Elmer, MA and SpectraMax plus, Molecular Devices, CA). In each experiment, maximum
hemoglobin release was determined by lysis of iRBCs in 1% Triton-X-100. At the end of the 5 hr incu-
bation period, the hemoglobin released in supernatant was quantified as percent fraction of maxi-
mum hemoglobin release. Hemoglobin released during the 5 hr incubation period in iRBCs sample
was subtracted in each experiment to normalize the background in all experiments.

 Statistical analysis
Each graph was generated from at least three independent experiments. For normally distributed
data, either mean ± SD or mean ± SEM was used, as specified. Statistical analysis was performed
using the software Graphpad Prism v7. Data was analyzed by either two-tailed Student’s t test, or by
one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).
