O
ver 40 million people currently suffer from Alzheimer’s 
disease worldwide, and as the global population ages, this 
number is predicted to approach 140 million by 20501. The 
deposition of the amyloid-β 
 peptide (Aβ) into insoluble aggre-
gates in brain tissues is the molecular signature of the disease, with 
 
Aβ 
42, the 42-residue form of Aβ, being the major component of 
the deposits2–5. Understanding, at the molecular level, the effects of 
intrinsic and extrinsic factors on the aggregation process of Aβ 
42 
is thus vital for developing effective therapeutic strategies aimed at 
inhibiting its self-assembly6,7.
Among such factors, the disruption of lipid homeostasis in the 
brain is strongly associated with the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s 
disease8,9. Quite generally, lipids are found ubiquitously within the 
amyloid deposits formed by Aβ 
4210, and it has also been suggested 
that comparative analysis of the lipid composition of the plasma and 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients and healthy controls could lead 
to the identification of effective disease biomarkers and prognostic 
indicators of therapies for Alzheimer’s disease9,10.
A critical role of lipids in Alzheimer’s disease is consistent with 
the fact that the ε 
4 allele of the apolipoprotein E gene (APOE) is 
the greatest currently known genetic risk factor for late-onset 
Alzheimer’s disease11,12. Apolipoprotein E is a crucial regulator of 
cholesterol metabolism in the brain and of triglyceride metabolism 
throughout the body13, and studies have shown that amyloid depos-
its fail to form in APOE knockout mice14. Therefore, much attention 
has been devoted to the link between Alzheimer’s disease and cho-
lesterol. Recent studies have suggested that plasma cholesterol levels 
are about 10% higher in Alzheimer’s disease patients than in healthy 
individuals15, and that cholesterol accumulates in senile plaques of 
patients and in mouse models of the disease10,16. Furthermore, it has 
also been suggested that statins, which are used to prevent cardio-
vascular diseases by lowering cholesterol levels, could also poten-
tially reduce the risk of Alzheimer’s disease17. Brain cholesterol, 
which exists primarily (> 
99.5%) in a non-esterified state, is largely 
formed in the myelin sheaths and cellular membranes of glial cells 
and neurons18, represents about 25% of the total amount of cho-
lesterol in the human body, and is important for neuronal devel-
opment, synaptic plasticity and brain function. The impairment 
of cholesterol homeostasis could therefore be an important factor 
in the pathogenesis of the disease19.
The mechanistic processes underlying the association of cho-
lesterol with Alzheimer’s disease remain, however, to be fully 
established20,21. Evidence for a possible causative role is provided 
by recent studies showing that modulating cholesterol levels can 
regulate Aβ aggregation20. For example, depleting cholesterol in 
hippocampal neurons in animal models of Alzheimer’s disease has 
been found to reduce Aβ 
42 aggregate levels, while raising it leads 
to their increase24. Additionally, lipid rafts, which are domains in 
cellular membranes enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids, have 
been implicated in the processing of the amyloid precursor protein 
(APP) through which Aβ 
 is generated9,10,25. Moreover, the region of 
residues 22–35 in the Aβ 
 sequence has been identified as a potential 
binding site of cholesterol21.
Although an interaction between Aβ 
42 and cholesterol has 
already been reported26, the specific mechanisms by which it occurs 
and affects Aβ 
42 aggregation have not yet been fully identified. 
 
Cholesterol catalyses Aβ42 aggregation through 
a heterogeneous nucleation pathway in the 
presence of lipid membranes

Alzheimer’s disease is a neurodegenerative disorder associated with the aberrant aggregation of the amyloid-β 
 peptide. Although 
increasing evidence implicates cholesterol in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease, the detailed mechanistic link between 
this lipid molecule and the disease process remains to be fully established. To address this problem, we adopt a kinetics-based 
strategy that reveals a specific catalytic role of cholesterol in the aggregation of Aβ 
42 (the 42-residue form of the amyloid-β 
  
peptide). More specifically, we demonstrate that lipid membranes containing cholesterol promote Aβ 
42 aggregation by 
enhancing its primary nucleation rate by up to 20-fold through a heterogeneous nucleation pathway. We further show that this 
process occurs as a result of cooperativity in the interaction of multiple cholesterol molecules with Aβ 
42. These results identify 
a specific microscopic pathway by which cholesterol dramatically enhances the onset of Aβ 
42 aggregation, thereby helping 
rationalize the link between Alzheimer’s disease and the impairment of cholesterol homeostasis.

For instance, the reduction in the rate of Aβ 
42 aggregation observed 
in the presence of 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine 
(DPPC) gel phase membranes was abolished on adding cholesterol 
to form liquid ordered bilayer membranes27. By contrast, other stud-
ies have suggested that cholesterol can inhibit interactions between 
Aβ and lipid membranes, thus increasing the extracellular levels of 
Aβ and promoting its aggregation28.
To investigate this problem, we analysed quantitatively the direct 
effects of cholesterol on Aβ 
42 aggregation using the strategy illus-
trated in Fig. 1. Our approach exploits the recent development of 
highly reproducible thioflavin-T (ThT)-based kinetic measurements 
and analytical approaches to their interpretation29,30. Such measure-
ments have made it possible to show that the aggregation of Aβ 
42 is 
characterized by a surface-catalysed secondary nucleation process, 
where the fibril surfaces act as catalytic sites for the generation of 
toxic Aβ 
42 oligomers. The generated oligomers can grow further 
and convert into fibrils, promoting the formation of additional toxic 
species in a highly effective catalytic cycle22,30–35.
Analysis of the reaction kinetics has also been powerful in 
characterizing the effects of intrinsic and extrinsic factors on the 
rates of individual microscopic steps in the aggregation process of 
 
Aβ 
4223,36,37. In particular, the diverse pathways through which mac-
romolecules, such as molecular chaperones and antibodies, can 
affect the aggregation of Aβ 
42 have recently been described in 
detail23,36,37,38. Moreover, using the same approach, the effects of dis-
ease-associated mutations and pH variations could be deciphered, 
showing that both factors can give rise to enhancements in the sec-
ondary nucleation process34. It has also been shown that the effects 
of small molecules on the different microscopic steps of the Aβ 
42 
aggregation process can also be monitored in detail, thus leading to 
the development of a chemical kinetics-based drug discovery strat-
egy that aims at identifying drug candidates that can inhibit specific 
steps in the aggregation reaction of Aβ 
4239,40.
In the present study, we extended this kinetics-based strategy to 
decipher the role of cholesterol in modulating Aβ 
42 aggregation. 
To this end, we characterize at the molecular level the effects of 
vesicles prepared with 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocho-
line (DMPC) and cholesterol (DMPC:cholesterol vesicles) on the 
microscopic steps of Aβ 
42 aggregation (Fig. 1). Our results indicate 
that these vesicles provide a model membrane that can effectively 
increase the nucleation rate of Aβ 
42. Furthermore, we show that, 
despite the occurrence of a cholesterol-dependent nucleation pro-
cess, surface-catalysed secondary nucleation remains the dominant 
mechanism for aggregate proliferation, as in the lipid-free aggrega-
tion process. We then provide evidence that primary oligomers of 
Aβ 
42, whether they are formed through homogeneous or heteroge-
neous nucleation events, are likely to possess structural similarities 
by showing that a previously characterized inhibitor of the homo-
geneous nucleation of Aβ 
42 aggregation also inhibits the heteroge-
neous primary nucleation events catalysed by lipid vesicles39.
Overall, these results reveal a self-assembly process that includes a 
heterogeneous primary nucleation step through which Aβ 
42 aggre-
gates in the presence of DMPC:cholesterol vesicles. This step can be 
significantly faster than that of homogeneous primary nucleation, 
leading to the more rapid formation of potentially neurotoxic oligo-
mers. We therefore propose a mechanism to explain how the pres-
ence of cholesterol can accelerate Aβ 
42 aggregation, thus enhancing 
our understanding of the molecular origins of Alzheimer's disease 
and potentially contributing to the development of effective thera-
peutics against this devastating condition.

Results
Cholesterol-containing 
lipid 
vesicles 
accelerate 
Aβ42 
aggregation. To decipher the role of cholesterol in Aβ 
42 
 
aggregation, we carried out a global kinetic analysis of its effect 
on the Aβ 
42 aggregation process29 in the presence of zwitterionic 
vesicles containing cholesterol at concentrations ranging from 0 to 
40 mol% of the total lipid concentration (Fig. 2 and Supplementary 
Figs. 1–4). We investigated this range because cholesterol accounts 
for about 20% of the total content of brain lipids, although its lev-
els in neuronal membranes can vary substantially from one cell or 
organelle to another41,42. Thus, for example, the outer monolayer of 
plasma membranes has cholesterol levels of around 30 mol%, while 
these levels are much lower in the corresponding inner monolayer43.
Because phosphatidylcholine (PC) lipids, together with phos-
phatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylserine (PS) lipids, con-
stitute the most abundant components of neuronal membranes44, 
we investigated the effects of cholesterol on Aβ 
42 aggregation 
for a series of model systems composed of zwitterionic PC lipids 
with different acyl-chain compositions in terms of the length and 
degree of unsaturation (DMPC (two chains C14:0), POPC (C18:1 
and C16:0) and DOPC (two chains C18:1)). We found that the 
level of unsaturation alters, to different extents, the effects of cho-
lesterol on Aβ 
42 aggregation, with the rate of aggregation increas-
ing with the degree of unsaturation of the PC hydrocarbon chain 
(DOPC > POPC > 
 DMPC) (Supplementary Figs. 1 and 4). These 
findings may be explained by the increased exposure to the hydro-
phobic hydrocarbon segment of the bilayer for the unsaturated lip-
ids with bulky hydrocarbon chains, as the average accessible area per 
PC headgroup in the bilayer varies from 60 Å2 for DMPC to 69 Å2 
for 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) and 
72 Å2 for 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC)45,46. 
 
By contrast, although anionic lipids, such as PS, can significantly 
influence Aβ 
42 aggregation and the structures of the aggregates47,48, 
they are mainly found in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane, 
and therefore are not enriched in the regions where cholesterol is 
primarily located.
Therefore, to assess specifically and systematically the effects of 
cholesterol on the aggregation of Aβ 
42 in a physiologically relevant 
system, we used model systems composed of DMPC and choles-
terol, which capture several important features of the behaviour of 
cholesterol in membranes that are highly relevant to lipid rafts49, 
including the formation of small-scale domains and of the liquid 
ordered membrane structure50–52. The advantage of these model 
systems is that DMPC alone does not significantly influence Aβ 
42 
aggregation (Supplementary Fig. 1), making it possible to identify 
clearly the effects of the added cholesterol.
Using DMPC:cholesterol vesicles, we found that increasing cho-
lesterol content significantly enhanced Aβ 
42 aggregation (Fig. 2 and 
Supplementary Figs. 1–3). These results also show that the effects of 
the lipid vesicles on the aggregation behaviour depend on both the 
lipid-to-protein (L/P) ratio (mol:mol) (Fig. 2b) and the cholesterol 
content within the membrane (Fig. 2c). We also observed similar 
behaviour when we added cholesterol to model membranes com-
posed of DMPC and 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanol-
amine (DMPE), further supporting the conclusion that the presence 
of cholesterol promotes Aβ 
42 aggregation (Supplementary Fig. 5)53,54. 
Moreover, we observed a broadening of the DMPC melting transi-
tion and an increase in the size and fluidity of the DMPC vesicles 
with increasing concentrations of cholesterol (Supplementary Figs. 6 
and 7)55,56. In addition, we found that the acceleration of the aggrega-
tion kinetics of Aβ 
42 was not directly related to an increase in the size 
of the vesicles (Supplementary Fig. 8).
A maximum effect corresponding to a decrease by about 35–40% 
in the half-time of the aggregation reaction was observed at [L]/[P] 
ratios above 200 for vesicles containing 5% and 10% cholesterol 
(Fig. 2b). For all [L]/[P] ratios, the acceleration in the aggregation 
kinetics of Aβ 
42 shows a strong dependence on the membrane 
composition up to a cholesterol content of about 15 mol%, and 
the acceleration appears to be unaffected by further increases in 
cholesterol (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Figs. 1–3). This nonlinear 
response of the aggregation kinetics to the concentration of choles-
terol suggests that specific changes in the membrane properties are 
crucial to the aggregation process57,58. These results can be rational-
ized by observing that in a PC lipid system at 37 °C, a single liquid 
disordered (ld) phase is present at cholesterol contents below 15%. 
In such a situation, the cholesterol molecules are homogeneously 
solubilized in the bilayer, gradually changing its properties and 
composition with increasing cholesterol content (Fig. 2c). When 
the cholesterol content exceeds 15 mol%, the system segregates into 
small-scale domains (‘rafts’) composed of ld and liquid ordered (lo) 
phases. At cholesterol contents above 30 mol%, however, a single lo 
phase is formed, and over the whole range of domain formation, 
the compositions in the segregated ld and lo domains are unchanged 
and determined by the compositions at the phase boundaries, 
 
with the proportions of the different domains varying with 
 
cholesterol content.
To exclude possible interference of the lipid vesicles with the 
ThT fluorescence signal, Aβ 
42 aggregation was also monitored by

circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy (Supplementary Fig. 9)59. We 
recorded time-dependent CD spectra of a 20 μ 
M Aβ 
42 solution in 
the absence or presence of DMPC vesicles with either 0% or 15% 
cholesterol at a [L]/[P] ratio of 10 (Supplementary Fig. 9). At time 0, 
the CD spectrum of Aβ 
42 exhibited a negative mean residue ellip-
ticity (MRE) at about 200 nm, which is characteristic of a disordered 
peptide. At the end of the reaction, however, the spectrum included 
positive and negative MRE values at about 200 nm and 218 nm, 
characteristic of the presence of β 
-sheet structure. The time depen-
dence of the MRE values at 218 nm (MRE218nm) in the presence of 
vesicles at a [L]/[P] ratio of 10 shows that β 
-sheet formation occurs 
at a slightly slower rate in the presence of DMPC vesicles than in 
their absence (Supplementary Fig. 9). This difference could arise 
from the multiple general contributions of foreign surfaces provided 
by both the cuvette and the lipid, as of which could affect the aggre-
gation process60. By comparing the spectra over time in the presence 
of DMPC:cholesterol vesicles containing 15% cholesterol, and in 
the presence of vesicles free of cholesterol, where general additional 
contributions from surface effects are similar, we observed that the 
formation of β 
-sheet structure of Aβ 
42 occurs more rapidly in the 
presence of DMPC:cholesterol vesicles than in DMPC vesicles free 
of cholesterol, in agreement with the results obtained using ThT-
based kinetics (Supplementary Fig. 9).
Morphology and structure of Aβ42 fibrils in the presence of cho-
lesterol-containing lipid vesicles. Using atomic force microscopy 
(AFM) we acquired high-resolution 3D morphology maps of Aβ 
42 
fibrils formed in the absence and presence of DMPC vesicles, the lat-
ter both free of cholesterol or containing 15% cholesterol at a [L]/[P] 
 
ratio of 10 (Fig. 3a)61. No significant differences in the length and 
height of the fibrils could be observed between the samples. Also, 
by using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), we found that fibrils 
formed in the presence of vesicles with 15% cholesterol (Fig. 3b,c) 
are of similar length and thickness as those formed by Aβ 
42 alone 
(Fig. 3d,e). However, the fibrils appeared to be organized slightly 
differently, implying that they could have altered surface prop-
erties. Previous observations of the presence of lipids in amyloid 
plaques10 suggest that lipids may be incorporated in the aggregates; 
indeed, few vesicles are seen, suggesting that such incorporation 
may have occurred (Fig. 3b,c). To investigate further the structural 
organization of the fibrillar aggregates, we used Fourier-transform 
infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy (Fig. 3f and Supplementary Fig. 10). 
The IR absorption of proteins is characterized by a series of amide 
bands, with the shape and position of the amide band I providing 
information on their secondary and quaternary structures62. We 
found identical amide I bands, and thus similar structural orga-
nization of the ThT-free Aβ 
42 fibrils within experimental error, 
as also demonstrated by the comparison of their second deriva-
tives (Fig. 3f and Supplementary Fig. 10). In addition, we carried 
out fluorescence measurements that show that the spectra of ThT 
bound to Aβ 
42 fibrils are similar in the presence and absence of the 
 
cholesterol-containing lipid vesicles during fibril formation 
(Supplementary Fig. 10).
DMPC:cholesterol vesicles accelerate the rate of Aβ42 primary 
nucleation by up to 20-fold. We carried out a quantitative analysis 
of Aβ 
42 aggregation in the presence of lipid vesicles to define the 
changes in the rate constants governing each microscopic step. The

the ThT fluorescence intensity to reach 90% of its final value after 
tlag) of Aβ 
42 aggregation shows that these vesicles have a concen-
tration-dependent effect on tlag but no significant effect on tgrowth 
(Fig. 4a). These results indicate that the primary nucleation path-
way is the main microscopic process perturbed by the presence of 
DMPC:cholesterol vesicles23,63. In addition, the scaling exponent of 
the Aβ 
42 concentration dependence, which reflects the dominance 
of the fibril-catalysed secondary nucleation process31, remained 
unaffected within error limits, with a value close to − 
1.3 in the pres-
ence of the cholesterol-containing vesicles (Fig. 4b).
We then carried out an additional series of measurements of the 
aggregation kinetics of Aβ 
42 under conditions where the surface-
catalysed secondary nucleation was suppressed by a molecular chap-
erone, the Brichos domain37 (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig. 11). 
In the presence of Brichos, Aβ 
42 aggregation is mainly driven by 
primary nucleation and elongation because surface-catalysed sec-
ondary nucleation is suppressed (Supplementary Fig. 11). We found 
that the aggregation kinetics of Aβ 
42 were significantly accelerated 
in the presence of DMPC:cholesterol vesicles, and to a much smaller 
extent when the vesicles are free of cholesterol (Fig. 4c). Thus, the 
observed effects can be attributed to an increase in the rates of pri-
mary nucleation and/or elongation when cholesterol is incorpo-
rated into DMPC vesicles.
Next, to define more quantitatively how cholesterol affects 
the microscopic rates, we modified the underlying kinetic equa-
tions (equations (1) and (2)) to account for the addition of a 
lipid-induced aggregation process to the three microscopic events 
(primary nucleation, surface-catalysed secondary nucleation and 
elongation) involved in the aggregation pathway of Aβ 
42. We anal-
ysed the aggregation profiles using these modified equations, which 
relate the macroscopic time evolution of the fibril mass to the rate 
constants of the different microscopic events. We found the best 
fits when the rates of the primary pathway (k+kn) were significantly 
increased, and the secondary pathways (k+k2) were relatively unaf-
fected (Fig. 4d,e). These results indicate that DMPC:cholesterol 
vesicles are mainly involved in enhancing the primary nucleation 
process, rather than the elongation process. Similar results were 
obtained for DMPC:cholesterol vesicles containing cholesterol 
levels as low as 5% (Supplementary Fig. 12). Additionally, the best 
fits of the Aβ 
42 aggregation kinetics in the presence of Brichos 
and DMPC:cholesterol vesicles correspond to an increase only in 
the rate of primary nucleation, thus further confirming the role of 
DMPC:cholesterol vesicles in accelerating the primary processes in 
Aβ 
42 aggregation (Supplementary Fig. 11).
Taken together, these data indicate that the DMPC:cholesterol 
vesicles act as catalysts of Aβ 
42 aggregation by increasing the forma-
tion of primary oligomers, thereby accelerating the overall aggrega-
tion kinetics. Thus, cholesterol introduces heterogeneous primary 
nucleation as an additive active process into the Aβ 
42 aggregation 
pathway. Thus, the primary nucleation of Aβ 
42 occurs through two

distinct mechanisms, a homogeneous pathway (with rate constant 
kn) where new aggregates are formed solely from the interactions 
between soluble monomers, and a heterogeneous pathway where 
new aggregates are generated at a rate kcat that depends on the con-
centrations of both monomeric Aβ 
42 and lipid vesicles. Hence, 
the overall rate constant of Aβ 
42 primary nucleation becomes kn′ 
, 
which accounts for the contribution of both kn and kcat to the initial 
step of aggregation (see Methods).
Heterogeneous primary nucleation depends on the concen-
tration of Aβ 
42 monomers and on the number of accessible sites 
for each peptide, s (in [L]/[P]), of the DMPC:cholesterol vesicles. 
Indeed, a steep linear increase with the [L]/[P] ratio in the primary 
pathways was observed for DMPC:cholesterol vesicles containing 
10% cholesterol at [L]/[P] ratios below 200 (Fig. 4e). In the case 
of DMPC:cholesterol vesicles containing 5% cholesterol, satura-
tion could not be observed even in the presence of [L]/[P] ratios 
as high as 400 (Supplementary Fig. 12). In all cases, the heteroge-
neous primary nucleation was found to be linearly dependent on 
the [L]/[P] ratio, and consequently on the number of accessible 
sites for each peptide s, before saturation is reached (see Methods). 
At high concentrations of accessible sites, that is, at [L]/[P] ratios 
above 200 in the case of DMPC:cholesterol vesicles containing 10% 
cholesterol, where the heterogeneous primary nucleation is likely 
to be restricted by the adsorption and desorption rates of the pep-
tide, the relative increase in the heterogeneous primary nucleation 
rate is maximal and corresponds to an increase by a factor of 20 ± 2 
relative to the homogeneous primary nucleation rate in the absence 
of cholesterol-containing vesicles (Fig. 4e). We next carried out 
a numerical estimate of the rate of formation of the total mass of 
Aβ 
42 aggregates in which we increased the rate of primary nucle-
ation by 20-fold (Fig. 4f). In agreement with the results of all the 
experiments performed in the presence of cholesterol to achieve a 
maximum rate of Aβ 
42 aggregation (Fig. 4f, inset), we found that 
the theoretical t1/2 is smaller than that of Aβ 
42 alone by about 40% 
(Figs. 2b and 4f). A theoretical prediction based on the analytical 
solution for the aggregation kinetics64–66 indicates that an increase in 
the rate of primary nucleation of an aggregation reaction translates 
into a decrease of about 34% in the reaction t1/2, which is fully con-
sistent with the experiments reported here (see Methods).
Chemical kinetics characterize the roles of Aβ42 monomers 
and cholesterol in DMPC:cholesterol vesicles in the heteroge-
neous primary nucleation step. The relative acceleration, ε, of

to the introduction of a lipid-associated heterogeneous pathway is 
dependent on the concentration of Aβ 
42 monomers, m(0), as well 
as the accessibility factor, σ, of the lipid system, which we found 
to be dependent on the proportion of cholesterol within the lipid 
membrane (equation (9)). We thus set out to characterize in detail 
the contributions to the heterogeneous primary nucleation pathway 
of the various species involved, including the Aβ 
42 monomers and 
the fraction of cholesterol in DMPC:cholesterol vesicles.
First, we observed that the total lipid concentration of the 
DMPC:cholesterol vesicles containing 10% cholesterol required 
for a maximum rate of Aβ 
42 aggregation was higher at increasing 
concentrations of Aβ 
42 (Supplementary Fig. 13). This observation 
implies that ε decreases as the concentration of Aβ 
42 monomers 
decreases. Considering that α (equation (10)) describes the relative 
increase in the primary nucleation rate due to the additional het-
erogeneous primary nucleation per accessible site for each peptide, 
a double logarithmic plot of αm(0)nc against the initial monomer 
concentration, m(0), yields a line with slope nh, which corresponds 
to the monomer concentration dependency of the heterogeneous 
nucleation pathway (Fig. 5a and Methods). The low reaction order 
observed for nh (nh < 
 2) suggests that, over the range of monomer 
concentrations probed in our experiments (1.5–3 μ 
M), the coverage 
of a single nucleation site by monomers could be saturated, such 
that the heterogeneous nucleation pathway in this case is primarily 
dependent on the number of accessible sites for each peptide [L]/[P] 
(see section Methods).
As observed above, the maximum rate of Aβ 
42 aggregation 
occurred at different [L]/[P] ratios for different cholesterol contents of 
DMPC:cholesterol vesicles (Fig. 2b,c and Supplementary Figs. 1–3). 
 
These effects were found to depend, in a nonlinear manner, on cho-
lesterol concentration, suggesting that the organisation of choles-
terol within the DMPC:cholesterol membranes may be responsible 
for creating the number of accessible sites for each peptide, s, for 
Aβ 
42 nucleation. To explain these findings, we hypothesized that 
the relative increase in the rate of primary nucleation, α, might be 
controlled by the presence of multiple cholesterol molecules. From 
the probability of observing m adjacent sites occupied by cholesterol 
molecules, p = θm, where θ denotes the surface coverage by choles-
terol, that is, the percentage of cholesterol within the membrane, we 
found the accessibility factor σ ~ θ 
m. To test this prediction, we plot-
ted α as a function of θ in a log–log plot, finding a line with slope 
m > 1 (Fig. 5b). This result indicates that the number of accessible 
sites for each peptide is correlated with the higher-order assembly 
of cholesterol molecules within the DMPC:cholesterol membrane. 
Therefore, under these conditions, at the maximal acceleration of 
Aβ 
42 aggregation, where the primary pathways are accelerated 
20-fold, assuming that the catalysis involves several molecules 
of cholesterol, the total number of catalytic sites is approximately 
10% the number of Aβ 
42 monomers (see Methods). These results 
imply the presence of positive cooperativity in the interaction of 
Aβ 
42 with cholesterol-containing membranes, and that a further 
increase in the number of catalytic sites does not increase the aggre-
gation rate. The total number of primary nucleation sites estimated 
in this way is found to be at least two orders of magnitude higher 
than the number of primary nucleation sites required for a maximal 
 
effect to occur.
We then explored whether or not Aβ 
42 oligomers formed as a 
result of heterogeneous primary nucleation possess similar struc-
tural features to those formed by homogeneous primary nucleation. 
Because primary nuclei are formed transiently during the aggrega-
tion process, their direct structural characterisation is very chal-
lenging6. We therefore investigated their structural properties using 
bexarotene, a small molecule that inhibits Aβ 
42 primary nucle-
ation, as a probe (Fig. 5c and Supplementary Fig. 14)39. We found 
that bexarotene inhibits Aβ 
42 primary nucleation  
irrespective of 
whether the primary oligomers of Aβ 
42 are formed through homo-
geneous or heterogeneous nucleation. These results suggest that the 
nuclei generated through homogeneous or heterogeneous primary 
 
nucleation share common structural features (Fig. 5c and 
Supplementary Fig. 14).
We then estimated the total rate of formation of oligomers from 
both primary and secondary processes in the aggregation of a 2 μ 
M 
solution of Aβ 
42 in the absence and presence of DMPC:cholesterol 
vesicles containing increasing concentrations of cholesterol (see 
Methods). We found that increasing the rate of primary nucleation 
increases the reaction rate of the aggregation without affecting sig-
nificantly the total load of toxic oligomers generated during the reac-
tion23,31,36,37,39,40. Consistently, our calculations show that increasing the 
rate of Aβ 
42 primary nucleation in the presence of DMPC:cholesterol 
vesicles is accompanied by earlier formation of oligomers (Fig. 5d).
Discussion
It is increasingly recognized that changes in lipid homeostasis can 
influence the levels of toxic species formed by Aβ 
42, as indicated

the primary nucleation of Aβ

monomers, or through heterogeneous nucleation, in which Aβ 
42 nuclei are formed from the interactions of Aβ 
42 monomers and lipid membranes. In 
either type of primary nucleation, once a critical number of fibrils is formed, secondary nucleation becomes the major source for generating new oligomers.

by the results of recent experiments carried out both in cell cultures 
and in rabbit models24,67. Moreover, the kinetics of Aβ 
42 oligom-
erisation and amyloid formation in vitro have been found to be 
affected by the presence of specific lipids including gangliosides 
 
and sphingomyelin68.
To help rationalize these findings, we have identified here a 
mechanism by which a specific lipid involved in the pathology of 
Alzheimer's disease influences the process of Aβ 
42 aggregation. We 
have shown, therefore, that cholesterol-containing vesicles provide 
an alternative heterogeneous primary nucleation route that results 
in a faster rate of formation of oligomeric species.
These results provide insights into the potential pathological role 
of Aβ 
42 in brain tissue. For typical cellular volumes (0.3–5 pl) and 
physiological levels of Aβ 
42 (1–10 nM), based on equation (6), we 
can estimate that it would take on average between 10 and 300 years 
for the Aβ 
42 aggregation process to occur spontaneously. We found, 
however, that the onset of Aβ 
42 aggregation is accelerated up to 20 
times by the heterogeneous primary nucleation pathway created by 
DMPC:cholesterol vesicles, thus dramatically reducing the average 
nucleation times to the range of months to decades. Although these 
estimates are only indicative, as they do not reflect the complex-
ity of the cellular environment, they illustrate how heterogeneous 
nucleation processes can substantially accelerate the formation of 
Aβ 
42 species (Fig. 6).
Overall, our results indicate that while spontaneous Aβ 
42 aggre-
gation may be a rather slow process, triggering it through hetero-
geneous nucleation pathways can increase substantially the rate of 
aggregation, suggesting that cholesterol, or other compounds with a 
similar effect on Aβ 
42 aggregation, could indirectly constitute a risk 
factor for Alzheimer's disease.
By describing a molecular mechanism through which DMPC: 
cholesterol vesicles promote Aβ 
42 aggregation, we have provided a pos-
sible explanation for the proposed link between the disruption of cho-
lesterol homeostasis and Alzheimer's disease. These results have been 
obtained by applying a chemical kinetics approach that allow us to dissect 
the overall macroscopic aggregation process of Aβ 
42 into its underlying 
component microscopic reactions. This strategy has led to the determi-
nation of the manner in which DMPC:cholesterol vesicles contribute to 
the early steps in Aβ 
42 aggregation by providing an alternative route for 
primary nucleation. The present work thus provides a clear example of 
the importance of understanding, in detail, the molecular mechanisms 
in which physiological factors can trigger the aggregation of Aβ 
42 in the 
complex molecular environment of the brain. As we have shown, these 
factors can dramatically reduce the typical timescale of Aβ 
42 aggrega-
tion, and thus their identification is crucial to understand the best points 
of intervention for strategies aimed at inhibiting or directing this process.

of Aβ 
42 involves a process whereby secondary nucleation is responsible for the 
generation of most of the aggregates31. The aggregate mass concentration M(t) and

primary nucleation, elongation and surface-catalysed secondary nucleation, 
respectively.
Using self-consistent methods, approximate analytical solutions to these 
differential equations can be obtained that describe the time evolution of the total 
fibril mass concentration, M(t), as31,32:

Note that, according to equation (3), to capture the complete macroscopic

The experimental curves shown in Fig. 4c,d and Supplementary Fig. 12 were 
fitted using equation (3) where we introduced perturbations to λ and κ in order 
to account for the inclusion of the lipid–surface catalysed process. This procedure 
was carried out by adding to the rate constants of each of the microscopic steps 
a new factor, x, which allows the description of the experimental curves in the 
presence of the lipids, that is, k′ = k + x. It was found that the best fits were derived 
when the rate of the primary pathways (k+kn) was significantly increased and the 
rate of secondary pathways (k+k2) was relatively unaffected. Coupled with other 
experiments (Fig. 4a-c) that support these fits, we observe that the lipid-catalysed 
process is mainly captured in the primary pathway, λ.
Theoretical model for a lipid-catalysed heterogeneous primary nucleation. The 
presence of low concentrations of DMPC:cholesterol vesicles introduces a new 
active process into the aggregation pathway of Aβ

where s denotes the number of accessible sites for each peptide, which is a function 
of the lipid-to-protein ratio, [L]/[P]. σ is the surface accessibility constant, and nh 
denotes the monomer concentration dependency of the heterogeneous nucleation 
pathway. It should be noted that the surface accessibility factor σ is dependent 
on the lipid system. In this particular study, σ is found to depend on the fraction 
of cholesterol in the DMPC:cholesterol membrane (Fig. 2b,c); in particular, σ is 
much greater with DMPC:cholesterol vesicles than with cholesterol-free ones. We 
rationalize the heterogeneous nucleation mechanism through the assumptions of 
the Langmuir adsorption isotherm, which indicates that the available lipid vesicles 
provide a surface for adsorption of Aβ 
42. This may facilitate nucleation and lead to 
the formation of Aβ 
42 primary oligomers on the surface of the vesicles.
Generalizing the self-consistent methods to the new kinetic equations, it is 
possible to obtain an approximate analytical solution for M(t) in the presence of 
the additional nucleation mechanism (equation (4)) as:

Hence, the additional heterogeneous nucleation mechanism can be accounted 
for by a modification of the rate constant of primary nucleation, kn, to give an

In other words, the analytical solution in equation (6) is equivalent to 
equation (3) with a slight modification to λ that accounts for the presence of the 
additional primary pathway. Hence, kinetic traces of aggregation in the presence 
of heterogeneous primary nucleation can be analysed simply by using equation (3) 
(the analytical solution in the absence of lipids), but the extracted combined 
parameter for the primary pathway, k+kn′ 
, must be interpreted, using equation (8), 
as an effective parameter that includes the effect from the heterogeneous primary 
nucleation step.
Assuming that the homogeneous primary nucleation rate is unaffected by the 
introduction of the heterogeneous nucleation step, using equation (8), we can 
compute the (relative) acceleration ε =

and it is therefore dependent on the concentration of Aβ

can be used to determine the reaction order for the heterogeneous primary 
nucleation step, nh. Specifically, the slope of a double logarithmic plot of αm(0)nc 
against m(0) is nh (Fig. 4a). The low reaction order observed for nh suggests that 
over the range of monomer concentrations probed in our experiments (1.5–3 μ 
M),  
the coverage of monomers along a single primary nucleation site could be 
saturated. Specifically, we can model the rate of heterogeneous primary nucleation 
using a Langmuir adsorption isotherm model by replacing m(0) by the monomer 
surface coverage 
=

(0), where K is the equilibrium binding constant. 
When the coverage of the primary nucleation sites by the monomers is large 
(m(0) > 
> K), the Langmuir adsorption process is saturated, meaning that 
m(0)cov is independent of m(0); hence, the saturation of primary nucleation sites 
could explain the observed low reaction order nh of the heterogeneous primary 
nucleation step with respect to the monomer concentration.
In the presence of a large number of accessible primary nucleation 
sites, the rate of heterogeneous primary nucleation is constrained 
by the availability of free Aβ 
42 monomers that could adsorb onto a 
primary nucleation site at any point of time, rather than by the lipid 
concentration, so the rate laws become:

By taking the maximum increase of k+kn′ 
/k+kn into account (Fig. 4f), we can 
conclude that the contribution of the heterogeneous primary nucleation increases 
the overall rate of primary nucleation by maximum 20-fold (equation (7)).
From the approximate analytical solution equation (3), t1/2 is found to occur at64–66:

Thus, if we consider solely an increase in the rate of primary nucleation, kn′ 
by 20 times, λ, the primary nucleation pathway, would increase by approximately 
20 times. Correspondingly,

2 would increase by approximately 20 times, 
with no change in κ (equation (3)). Hence, the relative increase in t1/2 due to the 
additional heterogeneous primary nucleation step is estimated to be 1/log(20) 
relative to the rate of the homogeneous primary nucleation, which is ≈ 34%.
Estimate in the number of primary nucleation sites. Under the assumption of the 
process of random and independent packing of cholesterol molecules on the 
surface of lipid vesicles, the probability of finding m-tuples of occupied adjacent 
primary nucleation sites is:
θ
=
p
(14)
m
where θ is the surface coverage by cholesterol, that is, the fraction of primary 
nucleation sites covered by cholesterol molecules (the percentage of cholesterol 
within the membrane). Because s = σ{[L]/[P]} (equation (5)), σ ~ θ 
m.
As we defined earlier (equation (10)), the slope α of a plot of 
′
k
k
n
n
 versus lipid 
concentration [L] depends on both σ and the concentration of monomer. Thus, for 
a constant protein concentration but different lipid systems (DMPC with different 
proportions of cholesterol), α can be used to determine σ. Because σ ~ θ 
m, the slope 
of a double logarithmic plot of α against the percentage of cholesterol within the 
membrane, θ, we find that m ≈ 3 according to Fig. 5b.
At given monomer and lipid concentrations, we can thus estimate the number 
of accessible primary nucleation sites per Aβ 
42 monomer:
=

sites
By taking the [L]/[P] ratio at which maximal acceleration of 2 μ 
M Aβ 
42 
aggregation is observed for the different cholesterol concentrations, the average rsites 
is found to be between 0.05 and 0.20 (Table 1).
