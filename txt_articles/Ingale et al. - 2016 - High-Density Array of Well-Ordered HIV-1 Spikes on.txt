SUMMARY
A major step toward an HIV-1 vaccine is an immu-
nogen capable of inducing neutralizing antibodies.
Envelope glycoprotein (Env) mimetics, such as the
NFL and SOSIP designs, generate native-like, well-
ordered trimers and elicit tier 2 homologous neutral-
ization (SOSIPs). We reasoned that the display of
well-ordered trimers by high-density, particulate
array would increase B cell activation compared to
soluble trimers. Here, we present the design of lipo-
somal nanoparticles displaying well-ordered Env
spike trimers on their surface. Biophysical analysis,
cryo- and negative stain electron microscopy, as
well as binding analysis with a panel of broadly
neutralizing antibodies confirm a high-density, well-
ordered trimer particulate array. The Env-trimer-con-
jugated liposomes were superior to soluble trimers in
activating B cells ex vivo and germinal center B cells
in vivo. In addition, the trimer-conjugated liposomes
elicited modest tier 2 homologous neutralizing anti-
bodies. The trimer-conjugated liposomes represent
a promising initial lead toward the development of
more effective HIV vaccine immunogens.
INTRODUCTION
A broadly effective HIV-1 vaccine will likely require the elicitation
of broadly effective neutralizing antibodies. Although broadly
neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) arise sporadically following
chronic HIV infection, such bNAbs are exceedingly difficult to
elicit by vaccination (Burton et al., 2004). One roadblock to the
elicitation of neutralizing antibodies by vaccination has been
the development of an immunogen that stably presents a
gp120-gp41 envelope glycoprotein (Env) trimer in its native state,
as it is presented on the virus surface. With the recent develop-
ments of SOSIP and NFL trimeric Env platforms, it is now possible
to express and purify soluble, native-like, and well-ordered Env
trimers that are structurally and antigenically well characterized
(Guenaga et al., 2015; Julien et al., 2013; Pancera et al., 2014;
Sharma et al., 2015). To date, these trimeric mimetics of the
HIV-1 native spike elicit homologous ‘‘tier-2’’ neutralization to
a few selected strains of undetermined long-term durability
(Sanders et al., 2015)—most potently, in small animals. Although
this is a promising first step, the next step is to quantitatively or
qualitatively increase B cell activation elicited by the well-ordered
trimers, toward the longer term goals of increased somatic hyper-
mutation and more durable antibody responses leading to trimer-
dependent elicitation of broader neutralizing activity.
An impediment to elicit neutralizing antibodies by HIV itself or
HIV-based virus-like particles (VLP) may be the low levels of nat-
ural Env incorporation, resulting in sparse numbers of spikes per
VLP (Deml et al., 1997). Here, we generated Ni+2-bearing, fully
synthetic, single-bilayer liposomes arrayed with the newly devel-
oped, well-ordered HIV-1 soluble trimer mimetics possessing
three C-terminal His tags per trimer. This design allows the var-
iable incorporation of Ni+2 lipids to generate a series of JRFL
trimer-conjugated liposomes displaying different levels of either
SOSIP or NFL well-ordered (Kovacs et al., 2014; Sanders et al.,
2013; Sharma et al., 2015) trimers arrayed on the liposomal sur-
face. This means of high-density particulate display also blocks
access to the non-neutralizing, non-glycosylated underside of
the trimers. This solvent-accessible surface, usually occluded
by the viral lipid bilayer, was recently shown to be highly immu-
nogenic, using soluble BG505 SOSIP trimers (Hu et al., 2015)
in mice; however, no tier-2 autologous neutralizing antibodies
were detected as they are in rabbits (Sanders et al., 2015). HIV
gp140 trimers conjugated to interbilayer-cross-linked multila-
mellar vesicles (ICMVs) generate high-titer binding responses
in mice (Pejawar-Gaddy et al., 2014), and biotin-labeled gp120
on avidin-containing liposomes stimulates anti-gp120 B cells
in vitro (Ota et al., 2013); however, well-ordered Env trimers
arrayed at a high-density particulate array have not been as-
sessed in an animal model capable of generating tier-2 autolo-
gous neutralization.
In our present study, we showed, by biochemical and biophys-
ical analysis, cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), and negative
stain EM, that the predominantly single bilayer liposomes, when
optimized, present the well-ordered trimers with high-density,
multivalent array. On the liposome surface, these well-ordered
trimers retained qualities of a closed native trimer and were
stable for several months at 4�C. We demonstrated that this

 high-density array better activated B cells ex vivo, compared to
strain-matched soluble trimers, and that the liposome-conju-
gated trimers more efficiently generated germinal center (GC)
B cells compared to soluble trimers in a statistically significant
manner. Compared to the soluble trimers, there was a trend for
the liposome-conjugated trimers to more efficiently elicit binding
antibodies to native-like trimers and modest tier-2 (JRFL) homol-
ogous neutralizing titers. The clinical efficacy of human papillo-
mavirus (HPV) L1 VLPs to provide long-lasting protection against
a virus that enters by mucosal routes—while, in contrast, the
HPV L1 monomer is not protective—suggests that particulate
display of ordered HIV trimers might hasten development toward
a more effective HIV-1 vaccine (Caldeira et al., 2010; Safaeian
et al., 2013; Schiller and Chackerian, 2014; Schiller and Lowy,
2015). Combining the well-ordered trimers with a particulate
high-density display presents a scalable platform to enhance
B cell responses to HIV-1 Env and, potentially, to envelope gly-
coproteins from other viruses that are relevant vaccine targets.
RESULTS
Well-Ordered His-Tagged Trimers for Liposomal Array
The development of well-ordered trimers by two independent
platforms, SOSIP and NFL, present the opportunity to assess
the multivalent array of such trimers on the surface of liposomal
nanoparticles to study their impact on antigenicity and immuno-
genicity. These well-ordered trimers are well characterized by
negative stain followed by EM at both the level of 2D classifica-
tions and 3D reconstructions, including the JRFL strain-derived
trimer prototypes used here (Guenaga et al., 2015; Sharma
et al., 2015). To contrast the ordered appearance of the JRFL
SOSIP and NFL trimers with the previously described disordered
foldon trimers (Ringe et al., 2015; Tran et al., 2014), we per-
formed negative staining followed by EM at the level of resolution
amenable for analysis of liposomes. As shown in Figure 1A (left),
the previously described JRFL-based gp140-foldons displayed
an amorphous mixture of oligomeric states. In contrast, the
more faithful mimetics of the HIV-1 Env spike, JRFL NFL and
SOSIP trimers, presented a relatively well-ordered appearance.
Depending upon the random orientation of the trimers on the car-
bon-coated grid, the soluble spikes displayed 3-fold symmetry
typified by a ‘‘propeller-like’’ appearance by negative stain EM,
at the level of resolution analyzed here (Figure 1A, center and
right). With the well-ordered trimers in hand, each containing
C-terminal His6 tags on each protomeric subunit, we sought to
array these spike mimetics on a repetitive, nanoparticle platform
to assess potential improvements in B cell activation and immu-
nogenicity. We generated liposomes by standard procedures
comprising a mixture of 60% 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phos-
phocholine (DGPC) and 40% cholesterol (Avanti Polar Lipids;
see the Experimental Procedures). We used a relatively high con-
centration of cholesterol to increase liposomal membrane stabil-
ity and integrity in vivo (Arsov and Quaroni, 2007). In brief, polar
lipids in chloroform were dried onto glass, re-suspended in
aqueous buffer, sonicated in the buffer, and extruded through fil-
ters to generate approximately 100-nm-diameter nanoparticles.
To produce His-binding liposomes, we incorporated 1,2-dio-
leoyl-sn-glycero-3-((N-(5-amino-1-carboxypentyl)iminodiacetic
acid)succinyl) (nickel salt) (DGS-NTA(Ni)) into the lipid mixture at
levels of 1% to 4%, substituting for the cholesterol lipid compo-
nent. We reasoned that NTA-Ni would randomly disperse in the
lipid bilayer and that, approximately 50% of the time, the polar
head groups would align on the outside of the lipid bilayer to
be available for conjugation with the His tags present on the
C terminus of the ordered HIV-1 trimers (see schematic in Fig-
ure 1B). We could also incorporate Toll-like receptor (TLR) li-
gands into the liposomes by including them in the chloroform
mixture prior to drying the lipids on to the glass surface (see
the Experimental Procedures).

tagged timers with the Ni-bearing liposomes, containing 1%,

 2%, and 4% DGS-NTA(-Ni) lipids, respectively, we performed
size exclusion chromatography (SEC) to separate free trimers
from liposomes. Next, we analyzed the liposomes by SDS-
PAGE and detected increasing trimer bands with increasing
levels of Ni+2 incorporated into the liposomes following staining
of the gel by Coomassie blue solution (Figure 2). We subjected
the 4% DGS-NTA(Ni) liposomes to dynamic light scattering
(DLS) to assess liposomal diameter and uniformity before and
after conjugation with the well-ordered NFL or SOSIP trimers.
As shown in Figure 2B, the non-conjugated liposomes displayed
an average diameter of 148 nm, while the average diameter of
trimer-conjugated liposome was 165 nm. To further assess lipo-
some uniformity and diameters and to visually determine the
state of trimers arrayed on the surface of the liposomes, we

 performed cryo-EM for both the JRFL SOSIP- and JRFL NFL-
conjugated 4% DGS-NTA(-Ni) liposomes (Figures 2 and S1A).
Using the cryo-EM images, we measured the liposome diame-
ters to be from 75 nm to 250 nm (see Figure S1B), consistent
with the DLS data. Using the measuring tools, we determined
the lipid bilayer to be �5 nm in width, with individual trimers
spaced at �12–14 nm apart on the liposomes. As detected by
the cryo-EM analysis, the majority of liposomes possessed a sin-
gle-lipid bilayer, and virtually all nanoparticles displayed a high-
density array of the SOSIP or NFL trimers, respectively. An
apparent double-lipid bilayer was visible on a small percentage
of liposomes and, for even fewer liposomes, multiple-layered
lipid bilayers were observed (Figure S1A), all possessing trimers
on their outermost surface. The liposome interior appeared to
contain only buffer, as no other density was observed in the en-
closed volumes. In addition, no other materials were observed in
the sample, indicating that the sample was free of any adventi-
tious agents.
To increase contrast and resolution of the trimers arrayed on
the liposomal surface, we performed negative staining followed
by EM at selected magnifications of the trimer-conjugated lipo-
somes. As seen in Figure 3, with 1% Ni-lipid formulation, the
conjugated well-ordered trimers were detected as a ‘‘ring’’
visible around the circumference of the liposomes, observable
by EM in what appeared to be two dimensions. In the case of
the 2% Ni-containing liposomes, beside trimers ringing the
circumference of individual nanoparticles, trimers could be de-
tected on the surface of the liposomes encircled by the lipid
bilayer. For the 4% Ni-containing liposomes, we observed
densely packed and evenly spaced trimers arrayed on the sur-
face of the liposomes by negative stain EM. The patterns of
trimer array were very similar for both the JRFL SOSIP- and

 JRFL NFL Env-containing liposomes. Because the trimers were
relatively well resolved, we next quantitated the approximate
number of trimers per liposomal field by constructing a grid to
aid manual counting (see Figure 3B). The total number of trimers
per visible field was in the range of 300 spikes per liposome,
likely an underestimate, since not all surfaces of the liposome
are observable in these EM images. Using the transmission EM
imaging platform (iTEM; EMSIS) measuring tools, we determined
the relatively uniformly arrayed trimers to be spaced �14–15 nm
apart, center to center, on the surface of the nanoparticles (see
Figures 3C and 3D). In addition, we constructed a square area
of approximately 12 nm per side that would encompass each
trimer and adjacent unoccupied surface area to circumscribe
an area of �144 nm2 (Figure 3D). We calculated the surface
area of a spherical liposome with a radius of �75 nm to be
70,865 nm2, and by simple division, it would yield �492 trimers
per liposome, bracketing an estimated range between 300 and
500 trimers per particle.
To confirm that trimer conjugation to the liposomes was Ni
dependent, DGPC liposomes without any Ni-lipid were gener-
ated, and the JRFL SOSIP trimers were added to assess interac-
tion. Most trimeric glycoprotein remained dissociated from
the liposomal fraction by SEC, and EM further confirmed that
no trimers were associated with the Ni-lacking liposomes
(Figure S2A).
Binding Analysis of the Liposome-Bound Trimers by
Biolayer Light Interferometry and EM
Next, we assessed whether the well-ordered trimers maintained
quaternary packing on the surface of the liposomes by probing
the trimers with selected bNAbs and mAbs using biolayer light
interferometry (BLI). Accordingly, we captured the trimer-conju-
gated liposomes on the Octet sensor surface by wheat germ
agglutinin (WGA), which recognizes and binds to carbohydrates
that are abundant as N-glycans located on the trimeric spike sur-
face. In this format, due to the dense array of the trimers on the
liposomal surface, there will be avidity effects with regard to the
bivalent immunoglobulins G (IgGs) as analytes; therefore, we
used the BLI binding analysis not to derive actual affinities but
to qualitatively assess relative avidities to confirm that, once
the trimers were conjugated to the liposomes, they displayed
the same binding pattern as assessed previously by more quan-
titative binding kinetics (Guenaga et al., 2015; Sharma et al.,
2015). Relative avidity was determined by the maximal response
value detected for each antibody at the completion of the asso-
ciation phase. Using the WGA capture of the trimer-conjugated
liposomes, we did attempt binding by selected Fabs to obtain
affinities, but due to the smaller mass of the Fab relative to the
liposomes, we could not detect reliable signals by this approach,
so we proceeded with the qualitative binding assessments using
bivalent IgG.
To begin the avidity analysis, we assessed recognition by the
CD4 binding-site-directed bNAb, VRC01 (Wu et al., 2011), and
the glycan-dependent 2G12 to determine overall levels of lipo-
some-conjugated trimers, since these mAbs can recognize
trimeric or monomeric forms of HIV Env (Figure 4A). The
VRC01 and 2G12 bNAbs efficiently recognized the trimers con-
jugated to the liposomes, consistent with previous binding
studies and the EM analysis presented here, as did the other
CD4bs-directed
bNAbs
PGV04
(Falkowska
et
al.,
2014),
CH103 (Liao et al., 2013) and b12 (Burton et al., 1994). We
then utilized the trimer-specific, V2-directed bNAb, PGT145
(McLellan et al., 2011), to confirm that, following conjugation,
the quaternary variable region cap of the trimers remained intact.
As expected, the trimer-specific PGT145 bNAb efficiently recog-
nized the trimers arrayed on the liposomal surface, as did other
trimer-preferring bNAbs such as VRC03 (Li et al., 2012; Tran
et al., 2012), VRC06 (Li et al., 2012), PGDM1400 (Sok et al.,
2014), and PG16 (Pejchal et al., 2010) (Figure 4A). In contrast,
the V3-loop-specific mAb, 447-52D (Stanfield et al., 2004), did
not bind to the JRFL NFL or JRFL SOSIP trimers on the lipo-
somes, indicating that the V3 region of these trimers is not
accessible when arrayed on the liposomal surface. These results
contrast with the BLI binding data shown here (Figure S3A) and
with previously published data (Sharma et al., 2015) that were
generated with the JRFL ordered trimers in solution and 447-
52D on the sensor surface. In this configuration, the well-ordered
JRFL trimers were well recognized by the V3-directed mAb. To
confirm this result in the same binding format used for the lipo-
somes, we assessed 447-52D recognition of the JRFL SOSIP
and JRFL NFL trimers when they were captured on the WGA
sensors. In this context, 447-52D recognized the trimers, indi-
cating that occlusion of the V3 region occurs only when the tri-
mers are arrayed on the liposomal surface. The non-neutralizing
mAb, F105 (Posner et al., 1993), does not efficiently recognize
the soluble JRFL NFL or SOSIP trimers (Guenaga et al., 2015;
Sharma et al., 2015) (Figures 4A and S3B), but it does efficiently
recognize disordered trimers, such as foldon (Guenaga et al.,
2015; Sharma et al., 2015). Here, F105 did not recognize the lipo-
some-conjugated trimers as assessed by BLI, indicating the
maintenance of a well-ordered trimeric state following liposomal
conjugation (Figures 4A and S3C). Since the previous affinities
using selected bNAbs were not determined by WGA capture
but by His tag capture of the JRFL trimers (Guenaga et al.,
2015; Sharma et al., 2015), we performed a comparative binding
analysis with most of the antibodies used to probe the trimer-
conjugated liposomes to confirm the relative rank order of the
antibody avidities to the trimers and the apparent occlusion of
V3 on the trimer-conjugated liposomes (Figure 4A).
We then probed both JRFL SOSIP and NFL trimers arrayed on
the 2% DGS-NTA(Ni)-lipid-containing liposomes with a subset of
Env-directed antibodies, but now qualitatively analyzed by nega-
tive stain EM, to determine relative accessibility of the neutral-
izing and non-neutralizing epitopes once the trimers are coupled
to the solid phase. Consistent with the binding analysis, when the
Env-trimer-conjugated liposomes were incubated with non-
neutralizing F105 mAb, in excess, there was no detectable bind-
ing to the ordered trimers compared to the unliganded control
trimer-conjugated liposomes (Figures 4B and S3D). In stark
contrast, when the glycan-directed bNAb, 2G12 (Trkola et al.,
1996), was incubated with the trimer-conjugated liposomes,
the propeller-like pattern of the well-ordered trimers was notice-
ably perturbed by this full IgG. Similarly, but with less disruption
of trimer symmetry, PGV04 and PGT145 binding to the trimers
could be observed following incubation and negative stain EM
(Figures 4B and S3D).

 Stability of Trimer-Conjugated Liposomes at Selected
Temperatures by EM
Next, we sought to determine the stability of the trimer-conju-
gated liposomes in aqueous buffer at both 4�C and 37�C.
Accordingly, we stored the liposomes at 4�C for an extended
period of time and assessed overall conformation by negative
stain EM. Both the liposomes and the trimers arrayed on the sur-
face of these nanoparticles were very stable for up to 4 months at
4�C (Figure S2B). We performed the same analysis of trimer-
bound liposomes stored at 37�C and detected more of an impact
on both the liposomes and trimers on the surface of the lipo-
somes. In brief, approximately 50% of trimers were lost from
the liposomal surface over a period of 7 days when stored at
37�C (Figure S2C).
Trimer-Conjugated Liposomes Are More Efficient at
Activating B Cells than Soluble Trimers
Next, we determined whether the well-ordered trimers on the li-
posomes were able to activate B cells following B cell-receptor
(BCR) engagement. For this purpose, we used B cells isolated

 by negative selection from the previously described mature b12-
expressing knockin mice (Ota et al., 2013). The B cells were over
99% pure, as characterized by flow cytometry using the B cell
markers CD19 and B220 (Figure S4). The B cells expressing
matched b12 H and L chains, possessing either IgM or IgD trans-
membrane regions, were activated for 18–20 hr with JRFL SOSIP
as soluble protein or liposomal preparation and stained with fluo-
rescent antibodies specific for the B cell activation markers
CD69, CD86, and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class
II. The B cell activation markers CD86, CD69, and MHC II were
upregulated in a dose-dependent manner in both formulations.
However, increases in the levels of CD69 and CD86 were signif-
icantly greater following incubation with the trimer-conjugated li-
posomes compared to the soluble trimers (Figure 5A), indicating
that the multivalent array of the HIV-1 trimers was more effective
for the induction of BCR signaling and activation. As shown in
Figure 5B, in addition to the increased MFI values associated
with liposomal activation, a clear shift in CD69 levels present
on the cell surface was observed in a greater percentage of
B cells incubated with the trimer-conjugated liposomes com-
pared to those incubated with soluble trimers. Next, we as-
sessed the expression of proinflammatory cytokines following
overnight incubation of the B cells with the two trimer types.
We assessed proinflammatory cytokines, since they are often
produced at higher quantities benefiting ease of detection, and
WEHI B cells were shown previously to express tumor necrosis
factor alpha (TNF-a) (Canfield et al., 2005). By ELISA, the levels
of TNF-a and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were significantly increased in
the culture medium of the B cells incubated with the trimer-
conjugated liposomes compared to the soluble trimers (***p =
0.0001 and **p = 0.008, respectively). These data are consistent
with the benefit of multivalent trimer particulate array to enhance
B cell activation. We performed additional experiments using
blank liposomes (4% DGS-NTA(Ni) liposomes lacking trimers)
as negative controls compared to the JRFL SOSIP-conjugated
liposomes. The induction of cell-surface activation markers
and the levels of cytokines induced by the blank liposomes
was negligible compared to the trimer-conjugated liposomes,
confirming that the B cells were specifically activated by the tri-
mers arrayed on the surface of the liposomes (Figure 5D). Given
that the liposomes used for these experiments were generated
without MPLA and R848, we confirmed that their integrity was
similar to that of liposomes formulated with these TLR agonists
by negative stain EM (Figure S2E).
Germinal Center B Cells Are More Efficiently Activated
by the Trimer-Conjugated Liposomes Compared to
Soluble Trimers
GCs are formed in secondary lymphoid organs such as lymph
nodes (LNs) and spleen, where activated B cells proliferate
and undergo immunoglobulin isotype class switching and so-
matic hypermutation (Victora and Nussenzweig, 2012). To
assess the capacity of the multivalent trimer liposomal array in
formation of GCs relative to the soluble trimers, we separated
C57BL/6 mice into three groups (five mice per group) and inoc-
ulated them with PBS (naive), soluble JRFL SOSIP trimers in
ISCOMATRIX adjuvant (CSL), and JRFL SOSIP trimer-conju-
gated liposomes in ISCOMATRIX adjuvant. We confirmed that
the ISCOMATRIX adjuvant did not affect the trimers by EM (Fig-
ure S2D). Fourteen days following inoculation, we observed that
the draining LNs were larger in the protein/adjuvant-inoculated
mice as compared to the naive mice. We isolated single cells
from the LNs of the five mice in each of the three groups and per-
formed flow cytometry analysis of CD19+ B cells positive for the
GC marker GL7. The flow cytometry analysis indicated a higher
percentage of B cells positive for GL7 in mice inoculated with the
JRFL SOSIP-conjugated liposomes compared to mice inocu-
lated with the soluble JRFL SOSIP trimers. Specifically, we
observed that the soluble trimers displayed a significantly
increased percentage of GL19+GL7+ B cells compared to naive
mice analyzed similarly (**p = 0.0012), as did the trimer-conju-
gated liposome mice (**p = 0.0015). More importantly, the Env
trimers arrayed on the surface of the liposomes elicited a statis-
tically significant increase in the percentage of CD19+GL7+
B cells compared to the levels elicited by the soluble trimers
(*p = 0.0152; Figures 6A and 6B), indicating that more efficient
GC formation was induced by particulate, multivalent trimer
array. To ensure that the increase in GL7+ B cells was elicited
by the trimers conjugated to liposomal surface and was not
due to non-specific activation from the liposomes themselves
or inadvertent acquisition of a contaminant during processing
(i.e., endotoxin), we performed additional control experiments
with blank liposomes (4% DGS-NTA(Ni) liposomes lacking tri-
mers) or JRFL SOSIP-conjugated liposomes. Fourteen days
post-inoculation, the percentage of CD19+GL7+ cells present
in LNs derived from individual mice was analyzed. Mice immu-
nized with the JRFL SOSIP-conjugated liposomes possessed
significantly higher GL7+ B cells compared to mice immunized
with the blank liposomes (***p = 0.0004; Figure 6C).
Binding and Neutralizing Antibodies Elicited by Trimer
Liposomal Array Compared to Soluble Trimers
Given the promising antigenic profile of the well-ordered trimers
and the ability of the liposome array of the spike mimetics to acti-
vate B cells more efficiently both ex vivo and in vivo, compared to
the soluble spikes, we next tested the trimer-conjugated lipo-
somes formulated in adjuvant for immunogenicity in a pilot rabbit
study. We also sought to determine whether inclusion of innate-
response-activating TLR agonists into the liposomes would
augment antibody responses. Three groups of four rabbits
each were immunized with 25 mg of protein either as soluble pro-
tein trimer in adjuvant or arrayed on the surface of 4% DGS-
NTA(Ni) liposomes containing TLR ligands either with or without
adjuvant. Control animals were immunized with blank liposomes
containing TLR ligands with adjuvant. Prior to inoculation, the
trimer protein concentrations on the liposomes were assessed
by protein dye to confirm and quantify the Env content per vol-
ume of liposome (see the Experimental Procedures).
After three immunizations, IgG titers were elicited against
JRFL SOSIP, as measured by ELISA with JRFL SOSIP captured
on the plate by the anti-His mAb (see Figure 7B). The soluble tri-
mers in adjuvant elicited relatively low, but detectable, binding
titers to the His-captured SOSIP immunogen. The trimer-conju-
gated liposomes with the incorporated TLR agonists, but not
formulated in the exogenous adjuvant, elicited very little IgG anti-
body response, indicating that the TLR ligands contributed little

 to activate the adaptive immune response to Env in vivo. In
contrast, the trimer-conjugated liposomes (+TLR ligands) that
were formulated in exogenous adjuvant elicited much higher
native-trimer binding titers compared to both trimer:liposomes
(+TLR ligands) lacking exogenous adjuvant and the soluble tri-
mers formulated in exogenous adjuvant. Taken together, these
comparative datasets demonstrated that the liposomal presen-
tation of the trimers rendered them more immunogenic than
soluble trimers in the presence of exogenous adjuvant. Blank
liposomes in adjuvant, as expected, elicited no detectable trimer
binding antibodies in the serum.
Due to the initial results indicating that the trimer-conjugated
liposomes in adjuvant were more immunogenic than the soluble
trimers in adjuvant, we performed additional boosts at 5-week
intervals and assessed binding titers in a longitudinal manner.
We observed that there was a trend for the liposomal trimers
to elicit higher binding titers to the native spike mimetics
compared to the soluble trimers over the course of immuniza-
tion (Figure 7C). Together, these data indicated that the trimer-
conjugated liposomes were more immunogenic and that the
trimer integrity was maintained in vivo when present on the lipo-
some surface. To further evaluate the quality of the antibody
response, we assessed the avidity of the sera to JRFL SOSIP
captured on plate by anti-His antibody. The animals immunized
with trimer-conjugated liposomes possessed antibodies dis-
playing higher avidity than those receiving soluble trimers;
however, the increased avidity was not statistically significant
(Figure S5A).
Next, to determine the quality of the neutralizing response, we
performed HIV pseudo-virus neutralization assays (Li et al.,
2005). We used sera isolated from individual animals immunized
with each trimer type 14 days following each inoculation with
either soluble or trimer-conjugated liposomes. Following both
the third and fourth immunizations, we detected modest autolo-
gous tier-2-like JRFL neutralizing titers from three of four rabbits
receiving the trimer-conjugated liposomes. Only one animal
immunized with the soluble trimers displayed weak neutralizing
activity at these time points. Although there was a trend for
increased neutralization titers elicited by the trimer-conjugated
liposomes compared to the soluble trimers, and in more animals
per group, as well as boosting of trimer-conjugated liposomes
compared to the soluble trimers, these differences were not sta-
tistically significant in this small pilot study (Figures 7D and 7E).
DISCUSSION
In this study, we made use of the new well-ordered Env trimers
recently designed in our laboratory to create a high-density mul-
tivariant array of these recombinant glycoprotein HIV spike mi-
metics on the surface of fully synthetic liposomes. We generated
synthetic nickel containing liposomes by incorporating lipids
bearing Ni+2 at the polar head group into the lipid bilayer to

 capture the C-terminally His6-tagged trimers. We demonstrated,
by both negative staining and cryo-EM, that both the NFL and
SOSIP trimers could be arrayed at high density, were stable,
and displayed a favorable antigenic profile following coupling
to the surface of the fully synthetic liposomes. We showed that
the well-ordered, trimer-conjugated liposomes more efficiently
activated B cells ex vivo compared to soluble trimers and better
generated GC B cells in vivo in wild-type mice in a statistically
significant manner. The trimer-conjugated liposomes displayed
a trend to elicit both native-binding antibodies and neutralizing
antibodies against the autologous HIV-1 tier-2 strain that is
more resistant to vaccine-elicited neutralizing antibodies.
These data indicate that we have developed a flexible plat-
form, in which potentially any His-tagged Env trimer can be
arrayed at high density. We could array, literally, hundreds of
trimers per particle, perhaps overcoming immune evasion mech-
anisms that HIV has evolved naturally to reduce activation of host
B cells. The non-glycosylated bottom surface of the trimers is
blocked by capture, using the His tag on the C terminus of the
trimers on the liposomal surface. This non-glycosylated surface

entry.

 was recently shown to be highly immunogenic, potentially divert-
ing neutralizing responses, rendering the SOSIP immunogens
incapable of eliciting neutralizing titers in mice (Hu et al., 2015).
The high density and uniform array indicates that all three of
the His6 tags bound to nickel on the liposome, although we do
not have direct evidence for this possibility. Array of the trimers
on the liposomes may stabilize more distal regions of Env, as
the V3 is partially exposed on JRFL Env (more so than most other
tier-2 viruses); however, on the JRFL trimer-conjugated lipo-
somes, we could not detect any V3 binding, even with IgG avidity
in play. The well-ordered trimers also exhibit enhanced stabiliza-
tion on the liposomes, as at 4�C, they remain tightly trimeric and
arrayed at high density over a period of multiple months.
In terms of B cell activation, the multivalent trimer array on the
surface of the liposomes seems to impart advantages in terms of
B cell activation both ex vivo and in vivo. We used mouse B cells
expressing the bNAb b12 and showed that there is enhanced
activation of these B cells, presumably via avidity gained by
the high-density multivalent array. Although the increased secre-
tion of IL-6 from the purified B cells following induction by the
trimer-conjugated liposomes was consistent with known cyto-
kine profiles, that TNF-a secretion was also increased was
somewhat surprising, as this cytokine is not usually secreted
by naive murine B cells, although it has been reported to be
secreted by human B cells (Plzakova et al., 2014) and WEHI
B cells (Canfield et al., 2005). This may indicate super-antigen
effects by trimer multivalent array or, most likely, an altered cyto-
kine profile in these engineered B cells. Less likely, TNF-a secre-
tion is indirect and occurs by dose-dependent activation of a
small percentage of myeloid cells in the >99% pure B cell
population.
In terms of immunogenicity in vivo, in a pilot rabbit study,
the trimer-conjugated liposomes displayed a trend to induce
increased binding titers to the native-like trimers compared to
the soluble trimers. The enhanced binding titers were detectable
beyond a boost or two, an initial indication of longevity of the
B cell response. This scenario is reminiscent of the arrayed L1
protein of the highly successful HPV vaccine, which imparts
long-lived antibody secreting B cells in humans (Schiller and
Chackerian, 2014; Schiller and Lowy, 2015). It will be very inter-
esting to determine whether the Env-conjugated liposomes can
accomplish prolonged antibody secretion in non-human pri-
mates on the pre-clinical pathway toward a vaccine candidate
using this type of system. Inclusion of TLR agonists into the lipo-
somal formulation did not render the trimers very immunogenic,
indicating that, at least, for the levels of TLR agonist incorporated
here, and the subcutaneous route of administration, these li-
gands contributed little to the adaptive immune response to
the trimers. The data shown here indicate a clear trend of benefit
of multivalent array over soluble trimers in vivo in the presence of
exogenous adjuvant. However, due to the small numbers of
animals per group in this initial study, statistical significance
was not achieved. Neutralizing capacity, although not robust in
our study, again displayed a trend toward being preferentially
induced by the trimer-conjugated liposomes; however, again, it
did not achieve statistical significance. Why we do not elicit
tier-2 autologous neutralizing responses approaching the levels
reported by Sanders et al. (2015) is unclear, but the JRFL strain
used here is generally resistant to vaccine-induced antibodies,
as apparently is not the case for BG505 when SOSIPs are inoc-
ulated into rabbits. In fact, for BG505, monomeric gp120 can effi-
ciently elicit autologous tier-2 neutralization in rabbits, whereas
JRFL gp120 does not elicit autologous tier-2 neutralizing anti-
bodies (Beddows et al., 2007). Further investigation will be
needed to determine trimer-virus pairing with regard to the elic-
itation of autologous tier-2 neutralizing antibodies, as well as the
elicitation of neutralizing antibodies in different animal models
using matched well-ordered trimer immunogens.
Due to the flexibility of the liposomal system described here,
expansion to incorporate well-ordered trimers from other clades
onto the liposomal surface is possible, either as a diverse array of
trimers on independent particles or with different trimers from the
same subtype, or from different clades arrayed on the same lipo-
some. Such array may have advantages to enhance responses
to conserved and common B cell epitopes and neutralizing de-
terminants. Using the approach described here, we demonstrate
proof of concept using Ni-dependent capture of well-ordered
HIV trimers as immunogens. For clinical applications of this
approach, we may need to use other divalent cationic lipids
possessing cobalt or zinc due to potential nickel inflammatory is-
sues, or it might be beneficial to use available maleimide-conju-
gated lipids to capture trimers possessing a free C-terminal
cysteine per protomer of each trimer to reduce any concerns
about release from the liposomal surface in vivo.
In summary, here, we present an initial analysis of the multiva-
lent array of ordered HIV trimers conjugated to liposomes in vitro,
improved over our previous Env:proteoliposome studies (Grund-
ner et al., 2002), and their potential advantages as an improved
immunogenic platform to more efficiently activate B cell re-
sponses ex vivo and in vivo.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Expression and Purification of Recombinant HIV-1 Trimer Proteins
JRFL SOSIP and JRFL NFL trimers were expressed in serum-free medium by
transient transfection of HEK293F cells (Invitrogen) with plasmid DNA, as
described previously (Sharma et al., 2015). In brief, the secreted proteins
were purified by galanthus lectin affinity chromatography followed by SEC.
Next, the trimer peak was subjected to negative selection by the non-neutral-
izing mAb F105 to retain disordered trimers on the column. The flowthrough
from the F105 column, containing the well-ordered trimers, was resolved by
a second SEC column to isolate a homogenous fraction of well-ordered
trimers.
Liposome Preparation, Protein Conjugation, and Lipid and Protein
Quantitation
For DLS, Octet, EM, GC analysis, and immunization, the liposomes were
composed of a molar ratio of 50:36:4:5:5 of DGPC, cholesterol, DGS-NTA(Ni),
monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA) (synthetic) PHAD (Avanti Polar Lipids), and
R848 (InvivoGen). For ex vivo studies, liposomes were composed of a molar
ratio of 60:36:4 of DGPC (Avanti Polar Lipids), cholesterol (Sigma Lifescience),
and DGS-NTA(Ni) (Avanti Polar Lipids). To form the liposomes, the aforemen-
tioned constituents were mixed in the appropriate ratios in chloroform and
incubated over glass, and chloroform was evaporated in the presence of
gaseous nitrogen. The resulting lipid film was dried further overnight (O/N) in
a desiccator. The lipids were hydrated in PBS for 2 hr at 37�C, with constant
shaking followed by vigorous sonication for 30 s. Next, the liposomes were
extruded for a minimum of 15 times through 1-, 0.8-, 0.4-, 0.2-, and 0.1-mm fil-
ters using a hand-held mini-extrusion device (Avanti Polar Lipids) at room
1996

 temperature (RT). For conjugation of protein to the liposomes, 2.2 mg of trimer
protein was added to 500 ml of liposomes and incubated at RT for 2 hr. The
unbound protein was removed from the liposomes by passing the liposome
mixture through a Superdex 200 column. The liposome fractions were
collected, pooled, and stored at 4�C.
JRFL SOSIP and JRFL NFL trimers conjugated on the liposomes were quan-
titated using a standard curve generated by either soluble JRFL SOSIP or JRFL
NFL trimers, respectively, using Advanced Protein Assay Reagent (Cytoske-
leon) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Phosphorus in liposomes
was estimated by a colorimetric assay reported earlier. Briefly, the phosphorus
(Sigma) standard curve was generated and used to determine the amounts of
phosphorus in the liposome samples. First, the organic samples were digested
to inorganic phosphate by heating the samples at 215�C for 25 min, followed
by addition of hydrogen peroxide and continued heating for additional 30 min.
Next, ammonium molybdate and ascorbic acid were added sequentially, and
again, the samples were heated at 100�C for 7 min. The absorbance at 820 nm
was determined for both the standard and the experimental samples.
EM
For negative stain EM, liposomes were applied for 3 min onto glow-dis-
charged, carbon-coated 400-mesh copper mesh grids (Electron Microscopy
Sciences). Excess sample was removed, and the grids were immediately
placed on a droplet of 2% phosphotungstic acid solution (pH 6.9) for 2 min.
Excess stain was removed, and the grids were allowed to dry thoroughly. Grids
were examined on a Philips CM100 electron microscope (FEI) at 80 kV, and im-
ages were acquired with a Megaview III charge-coupled device (CCD) camera
(Olympus Soft Imaging Solutions). For cryo-EM, samples were preserved un-
diluted in vitrified ice supported by holey carbon films on 400-mesh copper
grids. Samples were prepared by applying a 3-ml drop sample suspension to
a clean grid, blotting away excess with filter paper and immediately proceeded
with vitrification in liquid ethane. Grids were stored under liquid nitrogen until
transferred to the electron microscope for imaging. EM was performed using
an FEI Tecnai T12 electron microscope operating at 120 keV and equipped
with an FEI Eagle 4k 3 4k CCD camera. Vitreous ice grids were transferred
into the electron microscope using a cryostage that maintains the grids at a
temperature below �170�C.
BLI
Binding interactions between mAbs and the trimers conjugated to the lipo-
some surface or soluble trimers were examined by BLI using an Octet RED
system (ForteBio). Biotinylated WGA (Vector Laboratories) was captured on
streptavidin biosensors (ForteBio) at 50 mg/ml in PBS-B (PBS with 0.1%
BSA) for 180 s, followed by wash for 180 s in PBS-B. Next, the liposomes con-
jugated with trimers (10 mg/ml) were loaded onto the WGA sensors for 30 min,
followed by wash for 60 min. The biosensors were immersed in PBS-B ali-
quoted in 96-well plates to generate a baseline. Next, the biosensors were
immersed in a separate 96-well plate filled with PBS-B containing the mAbs
(20 mg/ml) for 300 s to allow association of the immobilized trimers with anti-
body. Association was followed by dissociation in PBS-B for 30 min. A con-
stant temperature of 30�C was maintained inside the instrument during all
reactions. A reference sensor was generated during each experimental run
to ensure that there was a minimal level of non-specific binding of mAbs to
the WGA sensors. Binding avidity of each IgG to the trimer-conjugated lipo-
somes was rank ordered as determined by the maximal binding signal at the
end of the association phase at 300 s.
B Cell Activation Assay
B cells from spleen and LNs were purified by negative selection using mag-
netic-activated cell separation (MACS) (Miltenyi Biotec), which uses mAbs
specific for T cells and monocytes conjugated to the paramagnetic bead to
retain all cells but B cells on the solid phase. Cells were plated as 1 3 105 cells
per well in a 96-well plate and stimulated with 50 mg/ml, 5 mg/ml, and 0.5 mg/ml
of soluble JRFL SOSIP trimers, JRFL SOSIP trimers conjugated to the 4%
DGS-NTA(Ni) liposomes, or 4% DGS-NTA(Ni) liposomes for 18–20 hr. The su-
pernatants were stored at �20�C for TNF-a and IL-6 ELISAs. Next, the cells
were stained with fluorescent antibodies specific for CD86, CD69, and MHC
II prior to analysis by flow cytometry. The experiment was performed in two in-
dependent experiments from different mature b12 mAb transgenic mice (Ota
et al., 2013).
Animal Inoculations
New Zealand white female rabbits were inoculated subcutaneously with 25 mg
of protein as either soluble or conjugated to 4% DGS-NTA(Ni) liposomes and
formulated in 20% of Adjuplex (Advanced BioAdjuvants) in a total volume of
150 ml. For the control group, blank 4% DGS-NTA(Ni) liposomes with MPLA
and R848 were formulated in 20% of Adjuplex. The liposomes contained
30 mg MPLA and 6.5 mg R848 per each injection. Test bleeds were collected
2 weeks after each inoculation. To determine in vivo GC formation, three
groups of 6-week-old C57BL/6 mice (five mice per group) were subcutane-
ously inoculated in the hind legs by hock injection (Kamala, 2007) with either
PBS, 10 mg of soluble JRFL SOSIP trimeric protein formulated in 1 U of
ISCOMATRIX, 10 mg of JRFL SOSIP trimeric protein conjugated to 4% DGS-
NTA(Ni) liposomes formulated in 1 U of ISCOMATRIX, or 4% DGS-NTA(Ni)
liposomes formulated in 1 U of ISCOMATRIX in a total volume of 100 ml. Four-
teen days following inoculation, the draining popliteal LNs were isolated and
prepared as single-cell suspensions and subjected to staining with mAbs as
described later.
The rabbit immunogenicity study was performed at The Scripps Research
Institute (TSRI). The TSRI Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
approved the study protocol (ARC # 10-0002), and all efforts were made to
minimize discomfort related to the inoculations and blood collection.
ELISA
ELISAs were performed in 96-well MaxiSorp plates (Nalgene Nunc Interna-
tional). Plates were coated for 4 hr at RT with anti-His tag mAb (2 mg/ml;
R&D Systems). After blocking the plates with non-fat milk and fetal bovine
serum (FBS) O/N at 4�C, the plates were incubated with JRFL SOSIP trimeric
protein at 2 mg/ml for 2 hr at RT. Next, the plates were incubated with 5-fold
serial dilutions of the immune sera starting at 1:200 and, after 1 hr, were
washed with buffer, followed by incubation with horseradish-peroxidase
(HRP)-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:5000) or HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit
IgM (1:5000) for detection. The plates were developed by a chromogenic sub-
strate for HRP, 3,30, 5, 50-tetramethylbenzidine (Life Technologies). Reactions
were stopped by the addition of sulfuric acid, and absorbance was measured
at 450 nm. For ex vivo studies, culture supernatants were collected, and cyto-
kine ELISAs were performed using DuoSet ELISA Development Kits (R&D Sys-
tems) according to manufacturer’s instructions.
Neutralization Assay
The pseudoviruses were prepared, and neutralization assays were performed
as described previously (Li et al., 2005). Briefly, rabbit sera were diluted and
pre-incubated with virus (200,000 relative light units [RLU]) for 30 min at
37�C before being adding to 10,000 TZM-bl reporter cells per well. These cells
contain an integrated luciferase gene under the control of the Tat-sensitive
HIV long terminal repeat (LTR). Virus was incubated for the cells for 48 hr to
allow infection and potential luciferase induction, after which the cells were
lysed, and relative luciferase units were measured by a Victor luminometer
(PerkinElmer).
Flow Cytometry of Mouse LN-Derived B Cells
Murine LNs were gently disrupted through a 70-mm cell sieve, followed
by extensive washing. All cells were labeled with live/dead cell viability
reagent (Invitrogen), followed by blocking with anti-mouse CD16/CD32 (BD
Pharmingen). Next, the cells were incubated with APC (anti-allophycocyanin)
anti-mouse CD19 and FITC (fluorescein isothiocyanate) anti-mouse GL7
(BioLegend) and post-fixed with paraformaldehyde before acquiring cells on
an LSRII (Becton Dickinson) to determine fluorescent mAb binding. Data
were analyzed with FlowJo software (TreeStar).
Statistical Data Analysis
For statistical analysis of cell-surface activation and cytokine secretion from
the trimer-activated B cells (Figure 5), values from each group were statistically
compared by a two-tailed paired t test with 95% confidence interval. Individual
activation markers or cytokine values were compared between the soluble

 trimers versus the trimer-conjugated liposomes at the same concentration of
stimulant. Values for the B cell GC marker, GL7 (Figure 6), induced by either
the soluble trimers or the trimer-conjugated liposomes were statistically
analyzed using the two-tailed unpaired t test with 95% confidence interval.
For the rabbit immunogenicity studies analyzing IgG binding and serum
neutralization (Figures 7B and 7D), the soluble trimer and trimer-conjugated
liposome values were statistically compared by two-tailed Mann-Whitney
test. All statistical analysis were performed using Prism (GraphPad Software),
and significance was defined as p < 0.05.
