Abstract
Indoor tanning is a known risk factor for skin cancer and is
especially dangerous for adolescents. Some states have
passed indoor tanning bans for minors, but business
compliance with the bans is not well understood. Thus far,
studies have assessed ban compliance in one or two states
at a time. This study aimed to assess compliance with
indoor tanning bans for minors and knowledge of dangers
and benefits of tanning among indoor tanning businesses.
Female research assistants posing as minors telephoned a
convenience sample of 412 businesses in 14 states with
tanning bans for minors under age 17 or 18. We evaluated
differences in compliance by census region and years since
ban was implemented and differences in reported dangers
and benefits by compliance. Most (80.1%) businesses told
the Bminor^ caller she could not use the tanning facilities.
Businesses in the south and in states with more recent bans
were less compliant. Among those (n = 368) that completed
the full interview, 52.2% identified burning and 20.1%
mentioned skin cancer as potential dangers. However,
21.7% said dangers were no worse than the sun and 10.3%
denied any dangers. Stated benefits included vitamin D
(27.7%), social/cosmetic (27.2%), and treats skin diseases
(26.4%), with only 4.9% reporting no benefits. While most
businesses followed the indoor tanning ban when a minor
called, one-fifth did not. Many stated inaccurate health
claims. Additional enforcement or education might increase
compliance with indoor tanning bans and action is needed
to prevent businesses from stating false health information.

INTRODUCTION
Indoor tanning is an established risk factor for mela-
noma and non-melanoma skin cancer [1, 2]. Approx-
imately 400,000 skin cancer cases are related to in-
door tanning in the USA annually [3]. Data suggest
there are stronger associations with skin cancer when
indoor tanning starts at younger ages and with increas-
ing frequency of use [1, 2]. While indoor tanning
among US high school students slightly declined from
2009 to 2013 among all females (prevalence of 25.4 to
20.2%) and non-Hispanic black males (prevalence of
6.1 to 3.2%) [4], approximately 1.6 million minors
continue to indoor tan nationwide [4, 5]. Given the
continued popularity of indoor tanning in the USA
and strong data on this as a risk factor for skin cancer, a
great deal of skin cancer prevention efforts for young
people have concentrated on reducing indoor tanning
[6]. The current need for skin cancer prevention pol-
icies, including ones for indoor tanning, directed at
youths was recently highlighted in US Surgeon Gen-
eral’s Call to Action to Prevent Skin Cancer [7].
Some cities and states have made efforts to limit
access to indoor tanning by enacting bans for minors
[8, 9]. Limited evidence suggests that such bans are
associated with decreased rates of adolescent indoor
tanning [10, 11]; however, other data indicate no sig-
nificant declines in use [12]. A limited number of
studies have evaluated compliance with indoor tan-
ning regulations in one or two states at a time. A study
assessing industry compliance in California, the first
state to pass an indoor tanning ban for minors, found
that 77% of 338 indoor tanning facilities did not allow
a researcher posing as a 17-year-old customer to make
an appointment during a telephone call [13]. Studies
of businesses in other states also reveal a lack of
compliance with regulations and guidelines related
to age of sale, safety, and communication of risks
[14–18].
At present, there is no federal regulation addressing
indoor tanning and minors. A federal ban may be the

Implications
Practice: The majority of businesses offering in-
door tanning appear to be compliant with indoor
tanning bans which may in turn decrease indoor
tanning among minors.
Policy: Policy makers who want to reduce the
prevalence of an important skin cancer risk factors
in adolescents should explore the possibility of a
federal ban on indoor tanning for minors.
Research: Future research is needed to understand
how enforcement of existing bans and education
can be used to further reduce the prevalence of
indoor tanning among minors.

 most effective policy intervention to reduce indoor
tanning in young people and is supported by numer-
ous organizations, including the Society of Behavioral
Medicine [19]. Recently, the US Food and Drug Ad-
ministration (FDA) took steps to increase regulation
and in December of 2015 proposed a rule for a nation-
al ban for those under age 18 and for adults to have to
sign a certification acknowledging the health risks of
indoor tanning [20]. At the same time, the FDA also
issued a second proposed rule for manufacturers and
tanning facilities to take additional measures, such as
more prominent warning labels and emergency shut
off buttons, to improve the safety of tanning devices
[20].
Thus far, there has not been a study that assessed
compliance with indoor tanning bans in all states with
regulations for minors under ages 17 or 18. Since the
number of states with indoor tanning laws for minors
has increased, a more thorough investigation of com-
pliance of all states with bans in one study design is
warranted. This study serves to describe the level of
compliance among businesses located in states with
indoor tanning bans for minors enacted as of
May 2015. We also assessed knowledge of dangers
and benefits related to ultraviolet (UV) indoor tanning
among the respondents at each business. Finally, our
study also adds new data to help understand variations
in compliance and health information, as we evaluated
potential differences by census region and time since
ban implementation and looked at compliance in re-
lation to stating benefits and risks.
METHODS
Study population
The target population was businesses offering UV
indoor tanning, with a focus on tanning salons, located
in the states with indoor tanning bans for minors under
17 or 18 years as of May 2015 [8, 9]. States with bans
for minors under 17 were Connecticut and New York,
and those with bans for minors under 18 were Califor-
nia, Delaware, Hawai’i, Illinois, Louisiana, Minnesota,
Nevada, Oregon, Texas, Vermont, Washington, and
the District of Columbia. New Jersey was excluded, as
its law was more complex with multiple bans for in-
door and spray tanning based on different ages. Lists of
indoor tanning businesses in each state were obtained
from Yellowpages.com, using the search term Btanning
salon.^ For each state, the number of businesses using
this search term varied widely, such that for some
states (e.g., Hawaii, Connecticut) with a small number
of businesses, we called the entire list of businesses. For
states with more than 125 businesses, we used a ran-
dom number generator to select a starting number and
then selected every nth business up to a total of 125. A
total of 1462 phone numbers were selected, and 412
businesses completed partial or complete interviews
between May 2015 and December 2015. The study
protocol was approved by the Yale University Human
Subjects Committee (Protocol no. 1504015679).
Indoor tanning ban compliance and knowledge survey
Female research assistants, who were aware of the
study design, posed as a 16- or 17-year-old minor
(based on each state’s law) and called the selected
businesses. They followed a standardized script
adapted from a study on compliance in one state
[13]. The research assistant started each call with a
brief introduction that included their age and then
asked the individual who answered the phone (e.g.,
facility employee, owner) whether they could use
the tanning facilities. Additional questions included
how frequently she could tan, whether there were
dangers from indoor tanning, whether tanning was
good for her, and whether it was okay to tan even
if her mother had skin cancer. Responses were
noted by research assistants on paper forms that
included pre-coded response options, as well as a
text field for any answers outside our pre-coded
options. Calls were not recorded due to the na-
ture of the study and the Connecticut state law,
where the calls were conducted, restricting the
recording of telephone calls without permission.
The pre-coded response options were generated
prior to the start of data collection based on
those reported in a similar study [13] and items
arrived at by the research team. In addition, after
conducting calls in the initial five states, any
responses that emerged as common that were
not originally part of the coding options were
added to subsequent call sheets.
The content of the open-ended responses was direct-
ly coded by each research assistant as she conducted
the call or immediately after each call using our pre-
defined list of possible answers and open text space.
The research assistants conducted a sub-set of calls
(n = 25) together with only one person speaking to
help ensure reliability in coding across interviewer
given we could not record the content of any calls. If
any open-ended responses did not fit into our existing
codes or there was a question about which code to
assign to a response, these were evaluated in a group
discussion by the two research assistants and the senior
author (LMF). The senior author made the final deci-
sions when consensus could not be achieved through
discussion.
Statistical analysis
Data were analyzed using SAS 9.4 software (SAS In-
stitute Inc., Cary, NC). Descriptive statistics were cal-
culated for the final sample (n = 412). If the interview
was interrupted or the respondent ended a call during
the additional questions about dangers and benefits,
the business was included in the primary analysis of
whether tanning was permitted among minors but
excluded in analyses of subsequent questions
(n = 368).
Compliance with the indoor tanning ban was
assessed by the proportion of tanning businesses that
told the Bminor^ caller that she could not use their
tanning facility and complied with the state-specific

 indoor tanning regulations. In New York, where the
law states that indoor tanning is permissible for a 17-
year-old with permission from a guardian or health
professional [8], responses stating that the minor could
tan with parental permission at age 17 were also coded
as compliant. For the questions about the dangers and
benefits of indoor tanning, every response from the
business was recorded.
States and the District of Columbia were categorized
into US census regions [21]: Northeast (Connecticut,
New York, Vermont), Midwest (Minnesota, Illinois),
South (District of Columbia, Delaware, Louisiana,
Texas), and West (California, Hawaii, Nevada, Ore-
gon, Washington). The number of years since imple-
mentation of the law was calculated by subtracting the
law’s start date for every state [8, 9] from the start date
of our study: May 1, 2015. We hypothesized that states
in the South and West would have lower compliance
due to a higher prevalence of indoor tanning and that
states in which the bans had been in place longer
would have higher compliance.
To test for differences in the proportion of compliant
indoor tanning businesses by census region and years
since implementation of the law, we used a Chi-square
(X2) or Fisher’s exact test. Similarly, we evaluated dif-
ferences in reporting of the three most prevalent dan-
gers, benefits, and responses to the skin cancer history
question by compliance with the bans using the X2 test
or Fisher’s exact test. P values less than 0.05 were
considered statistically significant.
RESULTS
Respondent characteristics
Of the 1462 telephone numbers obtained from our
internet search, we could not reach 561 of the
businesses, as 300 (20.5%) of the phone numbers
were no longer in service and 261 (17.9%) only
had voicemail messages despite calls on 2 separate
dates (Table 1). Among the 901 businesses that
were reached, 480 were ineligible: 311 (21.3%)
offered beauty services but not indoor tanning,
123 (8.4%) only offered non-UV tanning (e.g.,
spray tans, bronzing, and self-tanner), and 46
(3.1%) had discontinued their indoor tanning serv-
ices. Nine phone numbers were duplicates (phone
number listed twice online). This left 412 busi-
nesses with interviews: 368 (89.3%) with complete
interviews and 44 (10.7%) with partial interviews.
Compliance with the indoor tanning ban for minors
Of the 412 respondents, 80.1% stated they would not
allow the minor caller to use the indoor tanning facil-
ities and were considered compliant with the ban over
the telephone (Table 2). Fifty-one (12.4%) respondents

 sunburn. Respondents who were compliant with the
ban over the telephone were more likely to report
Boverexposure/sunburn^ (56.7%) as a potential dan-
ger than respondents who were non-compliant with
the ban (36.9% of those who said yes to minor tanning;
33.3% of those who said Bother^ to minor tanning)
(p = 0.003, data not shown). Approximately 10% de-
nied any dangers outright, but other responses were
ambiguous regarding dangers, including Bpossible to
use safely^ (10.1%), Bcannot say/do not know^ (3.0%),
and Bneed to come in person to discuss^ (15.2%).
All 368 respondents with a full interview answered
the question regarding benefits of indoor tanning. The
most common reported benefits included Bvitamin D
production^ (27.7%), Bsocial benefits (popularity/
cosmetic)^ (27.2%), and Btreatment of skin disease
(e.g. acne, eczema, psoriasis)^ (26.4%) (Table 3). Dif-
ferences by ban compliance were only present for the
potential of a social benefit from tanning. Businesses
that were non-compliant over the telephone having
told the minor she could indoor tan were more likely
to mention a potential social benefit (42.0%) as com-
pared to compliant businesses (24.7%) and those that
responded Bother^ to our compliance question
(25.9%) (p = 0.040, data not shown). Only 4.6% of
respondents did not clearly claim a health benefit to
tanning and another 5.2% said Bcannot say/do not
know.^
Recommendations for indoor tanning given family history of
skin cancer
Respondents were also asked whether the female mi-
nor caller could still indoor tan if her mother had skin
cancer (Table 4). The top three responses included
Breferred to an external source for information^ (e.g.,
talk to your doctor, look on the internet) (26.4%), Byes,
but reduce time/dose/frequency^ (26.1%); and Byes,
not a problem^ (24.2%). Businesses who were catego-
rized as non-compliant with the tanning ban and said
that the minor caller was allowed to use the facilities
were more likely to say Byes, not a problem^ regarding
the skin cancer family history questions (44.0%) com-
pared to compliant business (21.3%) and those that
responded Bother^ to our compliance question
(18.5%) (p = 0.002, data not shown).
DISCUSSION
Indoor tanning legislation and regulations serve to
protect minors from exposure to a known carcinogen
in order to safeguard this group from health risks,
namely, skin cancer, similar to bans on cigarette sales
to minors. While the majority of respondents from
indoor tanning businesses did inform the female minor
over the telephone that she was not allowed to use the
facilities, nearly 20% told the minor that she could use
the facility. This proportion of non-compliant respond-
ents is similar to that reported in similar studies in
California [13], Texas [18], and Wisconsin [17]. Earlier
studies in several states reported even higher percen-
tages of respondents who did not comply with state
laws and restrictions regarding indoor tanning [14–
16]. In 1993, a study in North Carolina found that
88% of 32 inspected tanning businesses did not have
or use parental consent forms for minors as mandated
by the state law at the time [15]. A 2006 study in
Massachusetts and Minnesota, when each state had a
law for parental permission, found that 81% of 200
businesses sold a tanning bed session to a minor with-
out parental permission on at least one of two tries [16].
In a telephone study focusing on states with laws for
younger minors, a 12-year-old minor caller in three
states with age restrictions was told they could indoor
tan by 11–77% of businesses. A similar range (17–
83%) was seen in this same study for a 15-year-old
minor [14].
Businesses in states that had an indoor tanning ban
for minors implemented for at least 2 years had the
highest level of compliance over the telephone. This
was in line with our hypothesis, and a similar pattern
was observed in the 2003 telephone survey in Colo-
rado, Texas, Illinois, and Wisconsin evaluating legisla-
tion for younger minors (ages 13, 14, and 16), with
higher compliance levels in states with longstanding
regulations [14]. Variation in state compliance levels
observed in our study may have been driven by other
factors as well, such as resources available for enforce-
ment of the law or associated penalties for breaking the
law. Though assessment of these factors was beyond
the scope of our study, an evaluation of the statues in
the first five states with indoor tanning bans for minors
found a great deal of variability [22]. If there is very
little penalty for non-compliance or there is little being
done to ensure compliance in the presence of higher
penalties, this may influence compliance. Consistent
and strong enforcement is likely an important factor to
consider for states considering bans, as well as in any
federal regulations that move forward.
Although the number of minors reporting indoor
tanning has slightly decreased over time [4], a substan-
tial percentage of this population continues to engage

 in high-risk indoor tanning behaviors. In 2013, the
national Youth Risk Behavioral Surveillance report
showed that 12.8% of minors in grades 9–12 had used
an indoor tanning device one or more times during the
past year [5]. While our study and others indicate the
potential for public health policy in discouraging in-
door tanning by minors, our findings also demonstrate
that there is still room for improvement with existing
policies to protect minors from the risks associated
with indoor tanning, as we saw that some businesses
still said that the minor caller was allowed to use the
facilities. Research utilizing national data has found
that indoor tanning legislation with age restrictions as
opposed to parental permission or systems access (e.g.,
warning labels, restrictive advertising) has the greatest
impact on indoor tanning rates [10]. However, some
state-specific studies point to the complex nature of
these regulations. In New Jersey, indoor tanning rates
among high school students did not significantly de-
cline after age restrictions [12], yet indoor tanning
among minors in Utah did appear to decline after
introduction of an age ban [11]. This indicates that
the effect of the ban may vary between states and
signals that additional research is needed to under-
stand the ways in which ban enforcement can maxi-
mize compliance.
Results from our study suggest that false and mis-
leading information is being given by some tanning
businesses regarding the dangers and benefits of in-
door tanning. Both vitamin D production and treat-
ment of skin diseases were commonly claimed as ben-
efits, and 10% of respondents denied any dangers
associated with indoor tanning. Similar dangers and
benefits were noted in a California study of indoor
tanning businesses, with 29.7% of respondents report-
ing that dangers are no worse than sunlight, 44% citing
vitamin D production, and 22.2% stating treats skin
disease [13]. In a 2012 investigation by the US House
of Representatives Committee on Energy and Com-
merce, staff members contacted 300 tanning busi-
nesses posing as 16-year-old fair skinned girls and
observed that 90% of the salons reported that indoor
tanning presented no risk, and 51% denied a link
between indoor tanning and skin cancer [23].
We found some evidence that the dangers and ben-
efits of indoor tanning mentioned by the respondents
differed based on whether or not the business stated
their indoor tanning services would be available to the
minor caller. Businesses that were non-compliant with
the laws were more likely to provide false information
about indoor tanning as compared to businesses that
were compliant. These findings might be related to the
quality and amount of training for indoor tanning
facility personnel. When asked about the dangers
and benefits related to indoor tanning, some respond-
ents either referred to or referenced information from
external sources. Though this was rare overall (3.2%
for dangers and 3.0% for benefits), most of the time,
the respondent told our caller to look online. Further-
more, when our caller asked specifically about indoor
tanning with a family history of skin cancer, the external
sources the respondents mentioned included doctors,
but also the internet. These finding suggest that tanning
businesses themselves are not the sole provider of mate-
rials and information about indoor tanning for adoles-
cents. It is important to be mindful of the resources that
inform adolescents to ensure that accurate information is
readily available about indoor tanning.
Some actions have been taken to stop the spread of
inaccurate health information about indoor tanning. In
2010, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) charged
the Indoor Tanning Association, an indoor tanning
industry group that represents tanning facilities and
manufacturers, with making false and misleading
health claims and in the settlement, the Indoor Tan-
ning Association agreed to no further deception [24].
More recently, in 2016, the FTC also filed charges
against Mercola, a tanning bed manufacturer, due to
misleading advertising. The settlement requires Mer-
cola to refund consumers who had purchased their
tanning beds and bans them from selling or marketing
indoor tanning systems [25]. The New York Attorney
General has also been a leader in this area with recent
agreements regarding several large indoor tanning
chains that will prohibit them from making health
claims and has ongoing investigations into health
claims made by indoor tanning businesses [26, 27].
While indoor tanning regulations have strengthened
over the past few years, more work must be done to
effectively communicate accurate information about
the risks associated with indoor tanning. Despite the
settlements described above, including some at nation-
al level, misleading and inaccurate health claims were
made over the telephone in this study. Even individu-
als who indoor tan recognize the need for accurate
information. A study of indoor tanners ages 18–30
found that 77.6% of female tanners wanted stronger
warnings and information about the risks associated
with indoor tanning [28]. Combating false health and
safety claims is an area where states and other organ-
izations can continue to take action against the indoor
tanning industry, which may in turn help decrease
indoor tanning among young people.
An interesting side finding was the number of listed
numbers in Yellowpages.com that were not in service
(e.g., went out of business), or the business reached
either never offered or had discontinued UV tanning
despite being listed under the search term tanning
salon. Closure of some of these businesses may be
due in part to the constantly changing policy landscape
for indoor tanning among minors as more tanning
legislation is introduced each month [9], but may also
be due to the 10% tax on tanning salons that was
introduced in 2010 as part of the Affordable Care
Act [7]. Additionally, some businesses from our online
search reported offering spray tanning rather than UV
tanning, with some stating they had switched from UV
tanning to non-UV tanning offerings.

 To our knowledge, this is the first study to system-
atically assess the level of compliance of indoor tan-
ning bans for minors across all states with indoor
tanning bans for minors under age 17 or 18. Using a
standardized telephone script that had been adapted
from a previous study in California [13], we also ex-
amined how tanning businesses communicated dan-
gers and benefits of indoor tanning. Our study includ-
ed states with indoor tanning bans among minors that
were enacted at different times across a 5-year span.
With this range of time, we could assess compliance by
years since the ban has been enacted. In addition, since
we surveyed all states with a ban for those under 17 or
18 years or age at the time of our study, we could
evaluate potential differences by region.
Certain limitations should be noted in this study to
adequately interpret the data. First, while telephone
versus in-person interaction may have resulted in dif-
ferent information, one study found that measuring
legislation compliance among indoor tanning busi-
nesses was comparable using both methods [29]. How-
ever, it is still possible that an in-person interaction in
the business might have resulted in differing access to
the indoor tanning facilities by a minor. We also only
evaluated states with bans for minors under age 17 or
age 18, as we felt the standardized script would not
have been as realistic for a younger minor calling
businesses in states with lower age bans. Due to the
nature of this deception study and Connecticut state
laws regarding recording telephone conversations, we
could not record the responses to our questions and
had to rely on writing down and direct coding
responses during the call. As our research assistants
were conducting calls separately, there is the potential
for differences in coding. However, we attempted to
minimize variability by having joint calls with the
interviewers at the start of the study and including
numerous pre-coded response options based on prior
research [13]. Additionally, while similar proportions
of businesses were sampled from each US census re-
gion, a limited number of businesses were reached in
Hawaii and the District of Columbia due to the small
number of business generated in our online search.
We used the search term tanning salon as we wanted
to target businesses specializing in indoor tanning who
were likely to be most knowledgeable about the laws.
While we likely missed some locations where tanning
beds may be found, our search term did return other
types of businesses, such as hair salons and gyms,
which also offer indoor tanning facilities. Given the
composition of our sample including mostly busi-
nesses that are solely tanning facilities, it is possible
that our data represent an overestimate of compliance
with indoor tanning bans. The female callers spoke to
only one employee per business, and therefore, the
responses of the employee have been interpreted to
represent the policies and responses of the business.
We did not collect any personal information about the
employee who answered the phone, so we are unable
to evaluate potential differences in information by
employee demographic characteristics, such as age or
education. We also could not assess how long an em-
ployee had been working at the business, which could
have influenced how knowledgeable they were of the
laws. Another limitation to our study is that we only
included states with tanning bans and did not have a
comparison group of states without bans. Therefore,
we are unable to assess if minors in states without bans
would be allowed to tan much more readily or if stated
benefits and dangers might be different in states with-
out bans.
Overall, this research improves our understanding
of one component relevant to evaluating the effective-
ness of state-level policies banning minors from using
indoor tanning facilities. Additional evaluation and
monitoring of compliance in tandem with collecting
data on indoor tanning rates is needed to understand
the impact of these policy-level interventions. Most
businesses in this study told the caller posing as a
minor that she would not be able to use the indoor
tanning facilities and so were in line with the state-
specific regulations on minor tanning. This indicates
that the current state-level bans are effective, to an
extent. Our results suggest that a federal ban on indoor
tanning for minors, which the US Food and Drug
Administration is currently proposing [20], could be
effective in reducing indoor tanning in minors in su-
pervised settings. However, if a federal ban is intro-
duced, retailer compliance and enforcement of regu-
lations are likely to play an important role in ensuring
the greatest public health impact. Furthermore, given
the variation we observed by region as well as time
since implementation, a federal ban for minors with
strong enforcement would provide a clearer message
to businesses and consumers alike regarding reducing
youth access and communicating the health risks of
indoor tanning.
Protecting adolescents from the dangers of indoor
tanning is an important major public health challenge
as signified by being one of the Healthy People 2020
objectives [30]. Importantly, limiting indoor tanning
among minors is predicted to substantially reduce
melanoma incidence, treatment costs, and mortality
[31]. Enacting well-crafted age restriction laws to max-
imize compliance through enforcement of penalties on
the state level and moving towards a national ban with
similar accompanying strong enforcement as pro-
posed by many national and international health
organizations [19] are essential to reduce skin cancer
risk in this vulnerable population.
