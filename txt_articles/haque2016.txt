IMPORTANCE Screening for carrier status of a limited number of single-gene conditions is the
current standard of prenatal care. Methods have become available allowing rapid expanded
carrier screening for a substantial number of conditions.
OBJECTIVES To quantify the modeled risk of recessive conditions identifiable by an expanded
carrier screening panel in individuals of diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds and to compare
the results with those from current screening recommendations.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Retrospective modeling analysis of results between
January 1, 2012, and July 15, 2015, from expanded carrier screening in reproductive-aged
individuals without known indication for specific genetic testing, primarily from the United
States. Tests were offered by clinicians providing reproductive care.
EXPOSURES Individuals were tested for carrier status for up to 94 severe
or profound conditions.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Risk was defined as the probability that a hypothetical fetus
created from a random pairing of individuals (within or across 15 self-reported racial/ethnic
categories; there were 11 categories with >5000 samples) would be homozygous or
compound heterozygous for 2 mutations presumed to cause severe or profound disease.
Severe conditions were defined as those that if left untreated cause intellectual disability
or a substantially shortened lifespan; profound conditions were those causing both.
RESULTS The study included 346 790 individuals. Among major US racial/ethnic categories,
the calculated frequency of fetuses potentially affected by a profound or severe condition
ranged from 94.5 per 100 000 (95% CI, 82.4-108.3 per 100 000) for Hispanic couples to
392.2 per 100 000 (95% CI, 366.3-420.2 per 100 000) for Ashkenazi Jewish couples. In
most racial/ethnic categories, expanded carrier screening modeled more hypothetical fetuses
at risk for severe or profound conditions than did screening based on current professional
guidelines (Mann-Whitney P < .001). For Northern European couples, the 2 professional
guidelines-based screening panels modeled 55.2 hypothetical fetuses affected per 100 000
(95% CI, 51.3-59.3 per 100 000) and the expanded carrier screening modeled 159.2 fetuses
per 100 000 (95% CI, 150.4-168.6 per 100 000). Overall, relative to expanded carrier
screening, guideline-based screening ranged from identification of 6% (95% CI, 4%-8%) of
hypothetical fetuses affected for East Asian couples to 87% (95% CI, 84%-90%) for African
or African American couples.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In a population of diverse races and ethnicities, expanded
carrier screening may increase the detection of carrier status for a variety of potentially
serious genetic conditions compared with current recommendations from professional
societies. Prospective studies comparing current standard-of-care carrier screening
with expanded carrier screening in at-risk populations are warranted before expanded
screening is adopted.

G
enetic testing of prospective parents to detect carri-
ersofspecificinheritedrecessivediseasesispartofrou-
tine obstetrical practice. Current recommendations by
professional organizations are to test for a limited number of
individual diseases in part based on self-reported racial/
ethnic background (Table 1).1,2 Multiplex platforms simulta-
neouslyassayingmanypotentiallypathogenicvariantsoneach
sample have become available, allowing rapid expanded car-
rier screening for a large number of conditions. These ad-
vances could facilitate screening for an expanded number of
conditions independent of racial/ethnic background.
Expanded carrier screening was first made available in
late 2009. A 2013 review3 of this initial experience examining
23 453 individuals found that 24.0% of individuals were car-
riers for at least 1 of 96 serious recessive conditions. This
information in part led the American College of Medical
Genetics and Genomics (ACMG), the American Congress of
Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), the National Society
of Genetic Counselors, the Perinatal Quality Foundation, and
the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine to issue a joint state-
ment on expanded carrier screening, suggesting a need for
more data on “the frequency of variants in previously
untested racial and ethnic groups” to facilitate general pan-
ethnic testing.2
The purpose of this study was to assess expanded paneth-
nic carrier screening in 15 self-reported racial/ethnic catego-
ries using either targeted genotyping or next-generation se-
quencing for up to 94 profound or severe conditions.
Methods
Study Population
The Western Institutional Review Board granted exemption
from further review of this study because the work was per-
formed only on deidentified existing medical records. As rec-
ommended by the ACMG,4 a generic consent form supple-
mented by online information about each disease was used.
The consent document included information regarding the
benefits and limitations of screening, as well as consent to al-
low use of anonymized testing data for research purposes.
Individuals in this study had expanded carrier screening
for genetic disorders. The test requisition form also included
an indication for testing. To minimize bias, individuals with
known personal or family history of a genetic disorder, those
with infertility, and those selecting other as the reason for test-
ing were excluded from the analysis (Figure).
Tests were offered and ordered by the individual’
s
physician, typically a general obstetrician or a specialist in re-
productive endocrinology or infertility, maternal-fetal medi-
cine, or genetics. Testing was primarily funded by a third-
party payer, the tested individual, or a combination of the 2.
Test requisition forms required individuals to self-report their
racial/ethnic background, choosing 1 of 15 possible catego-
ries. Racial/ethnic categories included an option for un-
known and an option for mixed ethnicity. These options were
chosen on the basis of specific professional guidelines
(eg, Ashkenazi Jewish), known genetic founder populations
(eg,Finnish),orUSCensuscategorizations(eg,Hispanic).Post-
test genetic counseling was available at no additional cost.
Conditions were classified as having profound, severe,
moderate, or mild severity based on a literature review and
the algorithm described in Lazarin et al.5 Use of this method
aimed to overcome the challenges associated with classifying
rare, unfamiliar conditions by assigning severity based on
widely recognized characteristics. The assumption was made
that the pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants occurring in
the genes corresponding to profound or severe conditions
were of clinical importance. Genetic variants with known
mild phenotype, uncertain significance, known incomplete
penetrance, or all 3 were also excluded (eTable 6 in the
Supplement). Of 110 genes tested that are associated with 112
conditions, 18 conditions are associated with moderate, mild,
or highly variable phenotypes and were excluded from the
analysis, leaving 94 profound or severe conditions to be ana-
lyzed (eTable 9 in the Supplement).
Diseases were further categorized based on the inclusion
in the carrier screening guidelines issued by the ACMG or the
ACOG and by the inclusion in the ACMG core newborn screen-
ing panel6 (eTable 9 in the Supplement).
Testing Platform
AllsamplesweretestedusingtheFamilyPrepScreen(Counsyl),
which screened for carrier status in up to 110 genes causing au-
tosomal or X-linked recessive conditions (eTable 9 in the
Supplement). For most genes, 2 testing platforms were avail-
able. The first was a targeted genotyping test using TaqMan
assaysontheFluidigm96.96platformtogenotype417disease-
causing variants. The second was a next-generation sequenc-
ing test using custom hybrid capture followed by sequencing
on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 to test for variants in select exons
and intronic regions of the same genes tested by the targeted
genotyping assay. Both technologies have demonstrated ana-
lytical sensitivity and specificity greater than 99%.7,8
Two genes were assayed separately for both platforms:
(1) the SMN1 exon 7 deletion causing spinal muscular atrophy
was tested using quantitative polymerase chain reaction and
(2) the FMR1 5′UTR expansion causing fragile X syndrome
was tested using polymerase chain reaction with capillary
Key Points
Question How might panethnic expanded carrier screening for
single-gene disorders be expected to perform compared with
current carrier screening recommendations in diverse populations?
Findings This retrospective modeling study of results from
346 790 expanded carrier screenings suggests that between 94.5
and 392.2 fetuses per 100 000 would be affected by 1 of 94
single-gene disorders, with variation depending on self-reported
racial/ethnic background.
Meaning Prospective evaluation of panethnic expanded carrier
screening approaches vs current professional society
recommendations is warranted to understand if the results would
lead to clinically meaningful differences in outcomes.

electrophoresis.9 Samples were accepted as whole blood, sa-
liva, or extracted DNA. The laboratory was certified under the
ClinicalLaboratoryImprovementAmendments(05D1102604),
accredited by the College of American Pathologists Laboratory
Accreditation Program (7519776), and received a permit from
New York state (8535).
Physicianscouldselectthetestingplatformusedandcould
customize the set of conditions screened; therefore, some in-
dividuals were not tested for all conditions. The number tested
for each condition is detailed in the Supplement data file on
the tab “chromosome frequencies.”
Individual variants were classified according to ACMG
guidelines, which was the consensus standard in the field at
the time of the analysis.10 Consistent with these guidelines,
most variants required literature evidence to be considered re-
portable. However, novel, putative loss-of-function variants
could be considered for pathogenicity without specific litera-
ture evidence. Specific details and classification categories are
described in section 3 in the Supplement. The laboratory pro-
tocol was to report only known and likely pathogenic vari-
ants. Variants of uncertain significance and benign variants
were not considered in this analysis.
Statistical Analysis
Additional details regarding the statistical methods used
appear in section 4 in the Supplement. Data from the tar-
geted genotyping and next-generation sequencing assays
were unified to estimate the chromosome carrier frequency
(the probability that a random chromosome carries a patho-
genic variant) for each condition in each racial/ethnic cat-
egory. Risk was defined as the probability of a hypothetical
fetus being affected and homozygous or compound heterozy-
gous for pathogenic variants for a given condition. Risk
was computed using the carrier frequencies accounting for
varying inheritance patterns.
Risk of fragile X syndrome was weighted by allele size, and
only male fetuses were assumed to be potentially affected. The
95%CIswerederivedbyrepeatingriskcalculationson100 000
samples from the carrier frequency posterior distributions to
compute a posterior distribution over risk and taking the 2.5
and 97.5 percentiles. Distributions over ratios of risks (eg, spi-
nal muscular atrophy vs cystic fibrosis in eTable 1 in the
Supplement and between positive rates for different racial/
ethnic categories) were computed by dividing 100 000 pairs
of computed risks from the relevant individual disease and
guideline or panel posterior distributions.
AllcalculationswereperformedusingPythonversion2.7.9
(Python Software Foundation) and the numpy (version 1.10.2),
scipy (version 0.15.1), and sympy (version 0.7.6) libraries. Un-
less otherwise stated, significance testing used the 2-sided
Mann-Whitney test on samples from the posterior distribu-
tion of risk or ratios of samples as appropriate. The level of sig-
nificanceusedwasα = .05,withBonferronicorrectionformul-
tiple hypothesis testing.
The results compare the prevalence of potential condi-
tions using modeled risks. This metric allows simpler com-
parison of a large number of conditions than do commonly
used metrics like carrier frequency and carrier couple fre-
quency (section 4.3.1 in the Supplement provides details on
the limitations of these metrics). The main analysis results
are for couples in which both members are of the same
racial/ethnic category (computations for all pairings are
included in section 7 in the Supplement). Carrier frequency,
carrier couple frequency, and modeled risk are provided in
the Supplement for all diseases and pairings of racial/ethnic
categories.

Results
Study Population
Between January 1, 2012, and July 15, 2015, 430 584 individu-
alsunderwentexpandedcarrierscreening(includingdatafrom
23 453 individuals that were previously reported3). After ex-
cluding patients with testing indications other than for rou-
tine carrier testing, 346 790 individuals remained (Figure and
eTable 3 in the Supplement). The main analysis of data in-
cludes 11 of 15 self-reported racial/ethnic categories in which
atleast5000individualsweretestedunderthisindication.The
data from racial/ethnic categories with fewer than 5000 indi-
viduals are included in section 7 in the Supplement.
There were 308 668 tests performed by targeted genotyp-
ing and 38 122 by next-generation sequencing (Table 2). Of the
tested individuals, 78.9% were female. Among those tested by
next-generation sequencing, females were relatively less com-
mon (60.3%; Fisher exact P < .001). The largest racial/ethnic
category was mixed or other Caucasian (n = 85 451). The small-
est racial/ethnic category included in the main analysis was
Southeast Asian (n = 6263). Finnish was the smallest racial/
ethnic category overall; however, there were only 213 indi-
viduals so these data are not included in the main analysis but
are included in the Supplement.
Risk of Single-Gene Conditions
Foreachracial/ethniccategory,therisksofparticularsetsofdis-
eases appear in Table 3. Among African or African American
couples, 5.2 fetuses per 100 000 (95% CI, 3.7-6.9 per 100 000)
were modeled to be affected by cystic fibrosis, whereas there
were 1.1 fetuses per 100 000 (95% CI, 0.7-1.8 per 100 000) af-
fected by a condition on the ACMG-recommended panel for
Ashkenazi Jewish couples. The columns in Table 3 are dis-
joint. Among African or African American couples, there were
3.1 fetuses per 100 000 (95% CI, 2.2-4.3 per 100 000) mod-
eled to be affected by a condition on the ACMG core newborn
screening panel (panel did not include cystic fibrosis or he-
moglobinopathies; Table 3). Similarly, there were 19.2 fe-
tuses per 100 000 (95% CI, 14.7-24.7 per 100 000) modeled to
be affected by a profound or severe condition in the ex-
panded carrier panel, which did not include any of the condi-
tions appearing in columns 2 through 7 of Table 3. Ratios of
risk are presented in eTable 1 in the Supplement.
The ACOG recommends universally offering cystic fibro-
sis carrier screening. Similarly, the ACMG recommends offer-
ing universal carrier screening for spinal muscular atrophy.
Although in the Northern European population only 26%
(95% CI, 23%-30%) as many hypothetical fetuses were mod-
eled for spinal muscular atrophy vs cystic fibrosis (P < .001),
in other racial/ethnic categories the ratio of spinal muscular
atrophy to cystic fibrosis was much higher (eTable 1 in
the Supplement). It was 67% (95% CI, 49%-88%) among
Hispanic couples, 106% (95% CI, 70%-154%) among African
or African American couples, and up to 1389% (95% CI,
450%-3594%) among East Asian couples. The smallest abso-
lute risk of spinal muscular atrophy was found in African
or African American couples with 5.3 affected fetuses

Carriers were defined as having 1 pathogenic variant in at least 1 tested
condition, and were not homozygous or compound heterozygous for any tested
condition. Unaffected individuals were not found to have any pathogenic
variants (either known or likely) in heterozygous, homozygous, or compound
heterozygous states. The tested conditions varied by individual at the discretion
of the ordering physician. A listing of common homozygous or compound
heterozygous genotypes is provided in section 2.2 in the Supplement.
Indications for testing (consanguinity, donor screening, family history, female
infertility, known carrier, male infertility, other, routine carrier screening) are
presented as captured from the test requisition form. “Other” reason was a
defined category on the test requisition form, and is not a grouping
summarizing several indications.

per 100 000 (95% CI, 4.2-6.6 per 100 000). The largest risk
of spinal muscular atrophy was found among Southern
European couples (15.1 affected fetuses per 100 000 [95%
CI, 11.7-19.0 per 100 000]).
FragileXsyndromewasmodeledtobemorecommonthan
spinal muscular atrophy in all racial/ethnic categories other
than Southeast Asian couples (P < .001 for all comparisons).
Among Northern European couples, 28.2 fetuses per 100 000
(95% CI, 22.2-35.1 per 100 000) were modeled to be affected
by fragile X syndrome compared with 11.5 fetuses per 100 000
(95% CI, 10.3-12.6 per 100 000) modeled to be affected by spi-
nal muscular atrophy.
Fragile X syndrome also was modeled to be more com-
mon than cystic fibrosis in most racial/ethnic categories, with
the exception of Northern European and mixed or other
Caucasian couples (P < .001 for all). For example, among
Ashkenazi Jewish couples, 54.7 per 100 000 fetuses (95% CI,
38.3-74.8per100 000)weremodeledtobeaffectedbyfragileX
syndrome vs 36.2 per 100 000 fetuses (95% CI, 31.4-41.5 per
100 000) modeled to be affected by cystic fibrosis. The risk of
fragile X syndrome for non-Ashkenazi European couples was
65% to 124% (95% CI, 50%-218%) of the risk of cystic fibrosis.
Severe and profound disorders not included in either car-
rier or newborn screening guidelines were more common than
cystic fibrosis or spinal muscular atrophy in all racial/ethnic
categories (Table 3; P < .001 in all racial/ethnic categories).
The highest prevalence of this subset of conditions was found
in Ashkenazi Jewish couples in which 115.4 per 100 000
fetuses (95% CI, 105.8-125.9 per 100 000) were modeled to
be affected by 1 of these diseases; the lowest prevalence was
found in the African or African American couples, with a cor-
responding rate of 19.2 per 100 000 fetuses (95% CI, 14.7-
24.7 per 100 000).
Detection Rate of Guidelines Within Racial/Ethnic Categories
The total modeled risk of profound and severe conditions
was partitioned for each racial/ethnic category according to
the guideline status and severity of the condition by which
a fetus would be affected (Table 4). Among African or
African American couples, 87% (95% CI, 84%-90%) of
fetuses would be affected by a condition within the guideline
recommendations for that category; 2% (95% CI, 2%-2%)
would be affected by a profound condition outside the guide-
line recommendations; and 11% (95% CI, 8%-14%) would be
affected by a severe condition outside the guideline recom-
mendations. In addition, among African or African American
couples, 1 in 275 fetuses (95% CI, 1 in 255 to 1 in 297 fetuses)
were modeled to be affected by a tested profound or severe
condition (Table 4). These data appear cumulatively in
Table 5.
In most racial/ethnic categories, the cumulative risk of
severe and profound conditions outside the guideline recom-
mendations was greater than the risk identified by guideline-
based panels (Table 5; P < .001 for all racial/ethnic catego-
ries). Among the Ashkenazi Jewish population, which has the
most extensive ethnicity-specific panel, 55% (95% CI, 52%-
59%) of fetuses with profound or severe phenotypes would
not be identified using a guidelines-based panel (392.2 per
100 000 fetuses [95% CI, 366.3-420.2 per 100 000] affected
by a profound or severe condition and 174.8 per 100 000
fetuses [95% CI, 164.2-185.9 per 100 000] affected by condi-
tions detectable by the ACOG and ACMG panel guidelines;
Table 3). Among Middle Eastern couples, 91% (95% CI, 87%-
94%) of affected fetuses would not be identified using a
guidelines-based panel (193.8 per 100 000 fetuses [95% CI,
149.0-248.1 per 100 000] affected by a profound or severe
condition and 17.7 per 100 000 fetuses [95% CI, 12.9-23.6

Asian couples (21%; 95% CI, 13%-30%) (Table 3). This was be-
cause the ACOG guidelines for these 2 racial/ethnic catego-
ries include testing for hemoglobinopathies. Hemoglobin vari-
ants in these racial/ethnic categories (HbS variant in African
or African American couples and HBA variants in Southeast
Asian couples) had higher frequencies than any other patho-
genic variants tested (eg, nearly 1 in 10 for HbS in African or
African American couples). Excluding hemoglobinopathies
from consideration (Table 3 and eTable 2 in the Supplement)
resulted in a pattern similar to other racial/ethnic categories.
Among African or African American couples, 82% (95%
CI, 76%-86%) of risk for nonhemoglobinopathy profound
and severe disease fell outside both the ACOG and ACMG
guidelines (47.0 per 100 000 fetuses [95% CI, 35.9-60.9 per
100 000] would be affected by a nonhemoglobinopathy
condition outside the guideline recommendations vs 10.5
per 100 000 fetuses [95% CI, 8.6-12.6 per 100 000] affected
by cystic fibrosis or spinal muscular atrophy). Among
Southeast Asian couples, 81% (95% CI, 71%-89%) of this risk
fell outside guideline recommendations (42.6 per 100 000
fetuses [95% CI, 26.5-65.2 per 100 000] would be affected
by a nonhemoglobinopathy condition outside the guideline
recommendations vs 9.7 per 100 000 fetuses [95% CI, 6.6-
13.6 per 100 000] affected by cystic fibrosis or spinal mus-
cular atrophy).
In all racial/ethnic categories except African or African
American and Southeast Asian, an expanded carrier panel
including the severe and profound diseases outside the
guideline recommendations would be expected to detect at
least twice as many hypothetical fetuses compared with the
ACOG and ACMG panel recommendations (Table 5 and
eTable 1 in the Supplement; P < .001 for all racial/ethnic cat-
egories). Among these racial/ethnic categories, the smallest
proportional change but largest absolute change was found
among Ashkenazi Jewish couples. The ACOG and ACMG
panel recommendations detected 174.8 hypothetical fetuses
per 100 000 (95% CI, 164.2-185.9 per 100 000), but the rate
including all profound and severe conditions was 392.2
hypothetical fetuses per 100 000 (95% CI, 366.3-420.2 per
100 000) (Table 5). The largest proportional change was in
East Asian couples, among whom the rate was 7.6 per
100 000 fetuses (95% CI, 5.9-9.5 per 100 000) for the ACOG
and ACMG panel recommendations but the expanded carrier
screening positive rate was 129.9 per 100 000 fetuses (95%
CI, 107.0-156.2 per 100 000). Both of these differences were
statistically significant (Mann-Whitney P < .001 for both).

ACOG and ACMG guideline panels exhibited a 42.2-fold dif-
ference (95% CI, 32.6- to 54.0-fold difference) in the rate of
detecting an affected fetus between the highest frequency
category (African or African American) and the lowest fre-

expanded panel including profound and severe conditions
not included in the guideline recommendations also had dif-

many rare conditions in a large, diverse, albeit selected
population. The findings showed that an expanded testing
panel identified more hypothetical fetuses at risk for severe
or profound phenotypes than did testing based on current
screening guidelines. This was not only because expanded
carrier screening included additional disorders but also
because guideline-based testing was based in part on self-
identified racial/ethnic categories. The data further sug-
gested that the guidelines recommended by the ACOG and
the ACMG at the time of the study did not perform equally
between racial/ethnic categories, resulting in differing
residual risk among different racial/ethnic categories. In
particular, expansion of the screening panel reduced the
maximum intercategory positive rate disparity from 42.2-
fold to 4.2-fold, suggesting that much of the difference in
residual risk may be driven by panel composition rather
than true variation in the interethnic rate of genetic disease.
Therefore, even though current guidelines target a number
of diseases prevalent in those of European descent (such as
cystic fibrosis), they do not identify risk for other conditions
that may be important to diverse populations. Expanded
carrier screening revealed that many non-European racial/
ethnic categories have a risk of a profound or severe genetic
disease that may not be detected by the guidelines in place
at the time of this analysis.
It has been challenging to determine which disorders to
include in prenatal screening guidelines. Suggestions include
that universally screened diseases should have a relatively
severe natural course and, according to ACMG, that they
should be of a nature “that most at-risk patients and their
partners would consider having a prenatal diagnosis.”2,11
The effect of early diagnosis on the potential health of the
child is also an important consideration because early inter-
ventions have been shown to improve outcomes for some
disorders but have not been demonstrated for others.12 Previ-
ous methods, such as those used by the ACMG to determine
its core newborn screening panel, have found categorizing
the severity of each disease particularly challenging.6 This
study used the general characteristics of each disorder to
classify it as mild, moderate, severe, or profound, using a
method shown to be both time efficient and highly concor-
dant with prior classification methods.5 However, this classi-
fication is based on limited available data regarding the phe-
notypic spectrum of these disorders. For many of the rarer
conditions, genotype-phenotype correlations have been
derived from very small known populations of affected indi-
viduals who manifest severe disease, and applicability to a
general population is unknown.
The difficulty in choosing conditions to be screened is
demonstrated by the discord between national organizations
regarding population screening for single-gene disorders. The
ACOG recommends only cystic fibrosis for universal screen-
ing, whereas the ACMG recommends both cystic fibrosis and
spinal muscular atrophy testing to be offered to all individu-
als. The carrier frequency of spinal muscular atrophy is well
established to be between 1 in 50 and 1 in 100, significantly
lower than the cystic fibrosis carrier frequency in those with
European race/ethnicity.3,13 However, the much lower fre-
quency of cystic fibrosis carriers without European race/
ethnicity indicates spinal muscular atrophy is relatively more
common among those with nonwhite race/ethnicity.
This study also brings additional data to the debate on
population screening for fragile X syndrome.14-17 The charac-
terization of the FMR1 allele size distribution for each racial/
ethnic category allowed calculation of size-adjusted risk for
fragile X syndrome (ie, risk calculation accounting for the
variable probability of full mutation transmission depending
on FMR1 CGG repeat count). In every race/ethnicity category
other than Southeast Asian race/ethnicity, fragile X syndrome
was modeled to be more common than spinal muscular
atrophy (P < .001), and in most race/ethnicity categories
fragile X syndrome was modeled to be more common than
cystic fibrosis (eg, per 100 000 fetuses in Ashkenazi Jewish
couples, 54.7 affected by fragile X syndrome vs 36.2 affected
by cystic fibrosis). Research suggests that early intervention
may improve outcomes in children affected by fragile X syn-
drome, but also that most of these children are not diagnosed
until after the period in which intervention can help.18-22 This
large population risk and potential treatability suggests
reconsideration of fragile X syndrome population (carrier or
newborn) screening.
Limitations of this study included the use of US profes-
sional guidelines for many of the comparisons. However, the
disease-specific frequencies provided in the Supplement
should allow comparisons with other screening approaches.
For comparative purposes, the study analyzed an artificial
construct by calculating disease frequencies in an affected
hypothetical fetus resulting from random mating (within a
racial/ethnic category in the main analysis included in the
article and across racial/ethnic categories in the Supplement).
Disease frequencies observed in actual populations may dif-
fer from the numbers reported herein for a number of rea-
sons, including the uncertainty inherent in modeling
assumptions, the racial/ethnic admixture common in many
modern societies, and the fact that the study population was
drawn from an available retrospective source rather than in a
random prospective manner.
In addition, the analysis adopted assumptions regarding
the outcomes associated with putatively pathogenic variants
in rare conditions. Mounting evidence illustrates the diffi-
culty in correlating genotype and phenotype for certain rare
and common conditions.23-25 The current study did not pro-
spectively assess the actual outcomes of the individuals
tested. Therefore, before assertions regarding the clinical
utility of broadly testing for these variants can be made with
certainty, additional data are needed from unselected diverse
populations on the phenotypic spectrum and for the health
consequences of pathogenic variants associated with rare
conditions.
This study did not examine the costs of expanded car-
rier screening or traditional screening panels because the
rapidly declining cost of next-generation sequencing has
made this difficult to assess. A recent study of a 14-gene
panel found next-generation sequencing testing to be cost-
effective compared with no screening or targeted mutation
analysis.26

Conclusions
In a population of diverse races and ethnicities, expanded car-
rier screening may increase the detection of carrier status for
a variety of potentially serious genetic conditions compared
with current recommendations from professional societies.
Prospective studies comparing current standard-of-care car-
rier screening with expanded carrier screening in at-risk popu-
lations are warranted before expanded screening is adopted.
