Poor physical functioning is perhaps the most per-

formally recommend that patients with CKD-5D
be “counseled and regularly encouraged by ne-
phrology and dialysis staff to increase their level
of physical activity.”4 However, the evidentiary basis
for recommending exercise training in CKD-5D is
still limited. Although the effect of regular physical
exercise training on physical performance in

 well documented,5 how exercise training should be articulated
(intradialysis or off-dialysis, in-center only, daily versus other
schedules) and implemented (duration and intensity) still re-
mains an open problem. In studies performed so far, physical
exercise was mainly proposed under supervision during the
dialysis session or between two dialysis sessions.5–7 However,
organization and cost problems mainly related with instru-
ments, personnel, and intensification of visits to the dialysis
center may hinder patients’ acceptability of exercise programs
and, ultimately, the diffusion of such programs.
On the basis of a model developed for peripheral arterial
disease rehabilitation,8 we designed an easy-to-implement
home program of physical exercise for patients with CKD-
5D and documented the feasibility of such a program in a pilot
study.9 After this pilot experience, we further simplified this
program into a format whereby a home-based, individualized,
low-intensity exercise program could be managed by the di-
alysis staff, without extra visits to the dialysis center (see video
at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ki8YX_t-0jA). We
have now tested in a multicenter, randomized clinical trial,
the EXerCise Introduction To Enhance performance in dialy-
sis patients trial (EXCITE), whether this home exercise pro-
gram improves the degree of fitness and
quality of life in patients with CKD-5D.
RESULTS
All eligible patients were recruited between
November of 2009 and February of 2011.
The Consolidated Standards of Reporting
Trials (CONSORT) diagram describing the
flow of patients through this open, parallel,
randomized, two-group trial is shown in
Figure 1.
The source population in the 13 Ne-
phrology Units participating in the trial
was composed of 714 patients receiving di-
alysis. Of these, 296 patients in nine centers
(59.6% eligible patients, 41.5% of total
population) were randomized to walking
exercise (n=151; hemodialysis, n=127;
continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis
[CAPD], n=24) or usual care and normal
physical activity (n=145; hemodialysis,
n=120; CAPD, n=25). As depicted in Fig-
ure 1, 227 of 296 patients (77%) could be
retested after 6 months (104 in the active
arm [hemodialysis, n=90; CAPD, n=14]
and 123 in the control arm [hemodialysis,
n=102; CAPD, n=21]). The reasons for
nonparticipation and exit from the study
are detailed in Figure 1. The two study
groups did not differ for demographic,
clinical, and biochemical data (Table 1)
but did for systolic BP (mean6SD; 138618 versus 127618
mmHg), which tended to be higher (P=0.06) in patients in the
active arm than in those in the control arm.
Adherence to the Exercise Program in the Active Arm
Out of 104 patients in the exercise arm who were re-evaluated
after 6 months, 76 correctly filled the study diary and 81 re-
turned the metronome for battery verification. Overall, 91
patients (87.5%) documented their degree of compliance to
theexercise programwithat leastoneofthesetwoinstruments.
As reported in the personal diaries, the average number of
sessions performed was 1196103 (range, 7–336), correspond-
ing to 83% of the 144 prescribed sessions. Forty-six patients
exceeded the number of prescribed sessions because they did
extra sessions on the dialysis days, whereas 29 performed just a
minimal amount (,10%) of the prescribed sessions. The level
of adherence to the exercise program was high for 55 patients
and low for 49 patients. The main determinants of low adher-
ence were scarce interest (n=22), orthopedic problems (n=7),
intercurrent nonorthopedic problems (n=10), and problems
related with work (n=10). The residual battery charge was
significantly higher in patients with poor adherence compared

All baseline measurements (including 6MWT and 5STS) were done after randomization.
Baseline demographic data, main cardiovascular comorbidities, and results of the 6MWT
and 5STS in patients who completed the 6-month training program and those who
dropped out in the two study arms are detailed in Supplemental Table 4.

 with those with high adherence (2.982 versus 2.961 mV;
P,0.05), but this indicator had very modest discriminatory
ability to identify patients with a high degree of adherence
from those with a low degree, and was not applied for the
stratification of patients.
Effect of the Home-Based Training Program on
Functional Capacity and Other Parameters
BP and heart rate remained unchanged after the 6-month ex-
ercise program in the exercise group (6-month BP, 133615/
7369 mmHg; heart rate, 7469 beats/min). Similarly, serum
creatinine (9.962.7 mg/dl), urea (150641 mg/dl), Kt/V (he-
modialysis, 1.4660.30; CAPD, 1.9360.66), albumin (3.760.4
g/dl), phosphate (5.061.5 mg/dl), calcium (8.861.0 mg/dl),
parathyroid hormone (269 pg/ml [range, 167–429]),
cholesterol (166638 mg/dl), triglycerides
(1826112 mg/dl), and glucose (115670
mg/dl) remained the same in the active
group. No change in the same parameters
was observed in the control group. Drug
therapy at baseline was similar in the two
groups and did not change across the trial
(see Supplemental Table 1).
The 6-minute walking distance (6MWD)
improved in the exercise group both
in analysis made in all randomized pa-
tients who started the trial (6 months
versus baseline: exercise group, +39 m
[95% confidence interval (95% CI), 33 to
46 m], control group, +2 m [95% CI, 25
to 10]; P,0.001) and in analysis re-
stricted to patients who completed the trial
(exercise group: +41 m, 95% CI, 31 to
51 m; control group +3 m, 95% CI, 27
to 12 m; P,0.001), (Figure 2, Supplemen-
tal Table 2). Among patients who com-
pleted the trial there was a dose–response
relationship between the adherence to ex-
ercise program and 6MWD changes across
the trial (Figure 3) (P,0.001). Among the
same patients at the 6-month testing ses-
sion, the average rate of the patient’s per-
ceived exertion by the Borg CR10 Scale was
unmodified both in the active group (2.6;
95% CI, 2.2 to 2.9 at baseline, and 2.8; 95%
CI, 2.5 to 3.1 after 6 months) and in the
control group (2.7; 95% CI, 2.4 to 3.0 at
baseline, and 3.2; 95% CI, 2.8 to 3.5 after 6
months). No effect modification by dialy-
sis treatment modality (hemodialysis ver-
sus CAPD) was found on the relationship
between allocation arm and changes in
6MWD (P=0.86) and five times sit-to-
stand test (5STS; P=0.26).
At baseline, 13 patients in the exercise
arm and eight in the control arm were unable to perform any
repetition inthe5STS. In addition, 25patients intheactivearm
and 21 in the control arm were unable to complete the test for
asthenia and peripheral fatigue. All these patients were main-
tainedinthetrialandafter6months, thecorrespondingfigures
of patients unable to perform any repetition were four (active
arm) and seven (control arm), and of those unable to complete
the test were nine and 15, respectively. Overall, across the trial
the proportion of patients completely or partially unable to
perform the 5STS was significantly reduced in the first group
compared with the second group (P,0.001, chi-squared test).
Among patients who completed the test, 5STS time im-
proved in the exercise group but not in the control group
(Figure 2) (between-group difference, P=0.001) and there
was a dose–response relationship between the 5STS time

 changes (6 months versus baseline) and adherence to the ex-
ercise program (P=0.01) (Figure 3).
Quality of Life
Overall, the global score (Table 2, last line) of the 19 items
composing the Kidney Disease Quality of Life, Short Form,
version1.3(KDQOL-SF)onaveragechanged
more favorably in the exercise than in the
control arm, but the difference largely
failed to achieve statistical significance
(P=0.17). When compared with changes
in the control arm only two items, both in
the kidney disease component (cognitive
function [P=0.04] and quality of social
interaction [P=0.01]), achieved formal
statistical significance.
Safety of the Exercise Program
Symptoms of moderate intensity, not lim-
iting the program execution, were reported
by 44 patients and included moderate fa-
tigue (n=31), “heavy legs” or leg pain
(n=35), moderate dyspnea (n=29), or
other symptoms, including joint pain
(n=17). Five patients reported four symp-
toms, 22 reported three symptoms, nine
reported at least two symptoms, and eight
only reported one symptom during the ex-
ercise sessions. Overall, the training pro-
gram was well tolerated and only five
telephone calls were received by the reha-
bilitation team across the trial. No angina
episode or other major symptoms/compli-
cations during exercise were reported in the
active arm of the trial. No systematic symp-
toms collection was undertaken in the con-
trol arm.
Secondary Outcomes: Death,
Cardiovascular Events, and
Hospitalizations
In a Kaplan–Meier analysis including ran-
domized patients who started the trial (151
in the exercise and 145 in the control arm),
there was a largely nonsignificant reduc-
tion in the risk of hospitalization. However,
in an analysis restricted to patients who
completed the trial, the hospitalization-
free survival was lower (P=0.04) in patients
in the active group than in the control
group (Figure 4). As detailed in Supple-
mental Table 3, among these patients there
were 18 hospitalizations in ten patients in
the exercise group (35 hospitalizations per
100 person-years; 95% CI, 21 to 55) and 35
hospitalizations in 24 patients in the control group (57 hos-
pitalizations per 100 person-years; 95% CI, 40 to 79).
An analysis of AV-fistula events in randomized patients who
started the trial showed that the incidence rate of these out-
comes did not significantly differ (P=0.22) between the exer-
cise (22 events in six patients, 35 events per 100 person-years;

 95% CI, 22 to 53) and control (13 events in six patients, 23
events per 100 person-years; 95% CI, 12 to 39) group. A par-
allel analysis in patients who completed the trial provided
similar results (ten events in six patients [19 events per 100
person-years; 95% CI, 9 to 35] in the exercise group and nine
events in seven patients [15 events per 100 person-years; 95%
CI, 7 to 28] in the control group).
DISCUSSION
In this multicenter, randomized trial in patients with stage
5D-CKD a simple, personalized, low-intensity, home-based
walking program managed by the dialysis staff improved the
functional status compared with usual care in these patients.
Two items in the kidney disease component of the KDQOL-SF,
namely cognitive function and quality of social interaction,
showed a statistically significant improvement in the exercise
group compared with the control group.
A comprehensive meta-analysis published in 2014 identi-
fied 29 randomized trials, all focused on a single center, testing
physical exercise programs in patients on dialysis.5 In the ma-
jority of these trials (14 trials) exercise was performed in-
center, during the hemodialysis session. Overall, these trials
documented an improvement in muscular strength and aero-
bic capacity. The number of patients in these trials ranged
from 13 to 96, and the vast majority had ,40 patients. In
most of these trials the outcome measure was aerobic capacity
and/or cardiovascular/hemodynamic biomarkers (BP, heart
rate, left ventricular mass) or muscle strength. Walking
capacity was a main outcome measure in just one of these
trials. The most recent meta-analysis, published in late
2015,7 added 11 trials to the 29 analyzed in the previous
meta-analysis. Again, these trials were relatively small (from
eight to 26 patients), almost all in-center (during hemodialy-
sis, n=9), and looked at disparate outcome measures. A global
analysis of the scientific quality of trials performed so far ac-
cording to the Cochrane collaboration recommendations10
showed that the random sequence generation and the alloca-
tion concealment in these trials was unclear. Furthermore, the
flow diagram of the progress of patients through the phases of
the trial and the outcome data in these trials were largely in-
complete, and reporting was selective in most trials.7 These
limitations notwithstanding, it is indisputable that research on
physical exercise performed so far in ESRD forms a solid basis
for considering physical exercise as a potentially valuable in-
tervention to improve health outcomes in this population.
The majority of physical exercise trials performed so far
tested interventions performed during the hemodialysis ses-
sion and consisted either of aerobic exercise (cycling) or re-
sistance training of some muscular groups against elastic
bands, or a combination thereof.5,7 These in-center programs
allow effective, supervised exercise training. On the other
hand, promoting therapeutic programs embedded in the ac-
tual familial and social context of individual patients,11 like the
home-based exercise program tested in this trial, is an impor-
tant opportunity for expanding the application of these pro-
grams and for patients empowerment.
The walking capacity encompasses cardiorespiratory and
muscle endurance, muscle strength, and balance and coordi-
nation, which is fundamental in daily living in patients with
chronic disease and in the elderly.12 In the systematic review
and meta-analysis by Heiwe and Jacobson,5 only one physical
exercise program was specifically focused on walking exer-
cise,13 and just four13–16 contemplated walking capacity as
an outcome measure. Of note, the intervention being tested
in did not improve walking capacity in any of these studies.
In a study of 26 patients, subsequent to Hewei meta-analysis, a
combined resistance and aerobic intervention17 was more ef-
fective than isolated resistance training to improve walking
capacity.
This multicenter trial tested a low-intensity (20 minutes of
walking at low-to-moderate speed every second day) exercise
program of gradually increasing intensity. The CONSORT di-
agram (Figure 1) shows that 32% (227 of 714) of the whole
population in participating centers actually completed the
training program, which is a significant proportion of the di-
alysis population. This program was well accepted by patients
and among the 151 patients randomized to the exercise arm,
104 (69%) completed the 6-month training. Such an inter-
vention allowed a meaningful increase in walking distance
(41 m). At least in theory, such an increase may favorably affect
clinical outcomes because, beyond the actual duration of the
trial (6 months), in a separate, long-term observational anal-
ysis of the EXCITE cohort extended to 3.3 years, we found
Figure 3. Dose–response relationship between achieved physi-
cal performance by the 6MWT and 5STS across the control arm
and the low adherence and high adherence to the exercise
program (active arm). The bars are SD of the mean. Low and high
adherence were defined as performance of ,60% and $60% of
the prescribed sessions, respectively. See also adherence to ex-
ercise program in Supplemental Material.

 that a 40 m increase inwalking capacityentailsan 23% reduction
in risk of mortality and an 8% reduction in risk of hospitaliza-
tion.18 This possibility needs to be tested in long-term trials
because the effect of interventions may wane with a reduction
in the intensity of staff involvement.19 Along with walking ca-
pacity, the exercise program increased muscle strength in the
lower limbs as measured by the 5STS test, a test predicting the
risk of falls,20 which is pervasive in ESRD.21 The response to this
test at baseline was very poor in both study arms (average time
19 versus 13 seconds in age- and sex-matched individuals). The
improvement (about 3 seconds) registered in this trial is of po-
tential clinical relevance because in elderly men it entails a 25%
risk reduction for all-cause mortality.20
In Barcellos et al.7 meta-analysis quality of life was tested in
21 trials in patients on hemodialysis. Small improvements in
the physical component score of the Short Form 36 were noted
in four studies,22–27 two of which combined the exercise pro-
gram to a pharmacologic intervention, i.e., erythropoietin to
normalize hematocrit24 or nandrolone.25 Only two trials ap-
plied the instrument specific to CKD, the KDQOL-SF,26,27
which we adopted in this trial. We found a favorable trend
for quality of life to improve in the exercise group compared
with the control group, with a significant improvement re-
stricted to two items from the kidney disease component of
the KDQOL-SF, namely cognitive function and quality of so-
cial interaction. Overall, our data are in keeping with the con-
cept that exercise may contribute to improve quality of life
even though in our study the effect of this intervention per
se was mild. Improving quality of life in this population is a
challenging goal and perhaps multiple interventions represent
the best approach to the problem.28
The study has limitations. First, given the nature of the
intervention, the trial was designed as a randomized, un-
blinded trial. However, physical performance testing and
help in quality of life questionnaire compilation was done by
operatorsnotinvolvedinthedailycareofpatientsparticipating
in the study. Second, the duration of the trial was limited to
6 months. Further study is needed to assess the long-term
adherence to this home-based physical ex-
ercise program. Third, even though im-
provement in physical performance and
quality of life are relevant outcomes, our
study was not powered to assess the effect
of physical exercise on major clinical out-
comes like death and cardiovascular events.
In this respect, analysis of hospitalizations
in patients who completed the trial was of
borderline significance, suggesting a poten-
tial beneficial effect of exercise on hospital-
ization. However, the number of events was
small. The important question of whether
exercise programs may translate into a re-
duction of hospitalizations needs to be
tested in a well powered, long-term trial.
Inconclusion,thistrialshowsthat asim-
ple, home-based exercise program delivered by dialysis staff
safely improves physical capacity and two relevant items in the
kidney disease component of KDQOL-SF in patients who can
complete this program. This trial further highlights the poten-
tial of exercise for improving physical performance in ESRD,
and represents a stimulus to the nephrology community for
undertaking long-term trials testing simple, sustainable exer-
cise programs looking at clinical end points, including death
and cardiovascular disease, in this very high-risk population.
CONCISE METHODS
The protocol of the EXCITE trial (Clinicaltrials.gov identifier:
NCT01255969) was approved by the hospital ethics committees of
the nine renal units participating in the study, and written informed
consent was obtained from all patients.
Study Design
Exclusion criteria included physical (e.g., amputation) or clinical
(severe effort angina or stage 4 NYHA heart failure, any intercurrent
illness requiring hospitalization) limitations to mobility or a high de-
gree of fitness, that is the ability to walk a distance of .550 m in
6 minutes during the standard walking test (see below).
The study is a randomized controlled trial aimed at testing the
effect of an individualized, home-based, low-intensity personalized
program of walking exercise (exercise group) versus nonexposure
(control group) on functional capacity and other clinical end points
in patients with stage G5 CKD. To ensure balanced allocation of
patients with heart disease across the two treatments groups, random-
ization was stratified by NYHA class. Allocation concealment was
ensured by central randomization and nominal communication of
patient allocation in the two arms of the study across the whole re-
cruitment phase of the trial. Patients in the control group received
usual care and generic advice to maintain an active lifestyle. The de-
scription of the 6-minute walking test (6MWT), i.e., the test adopted
as a basis for stepping up the home-based exercise program, is de-
scribed in Table 3, alongside the 5STS. Both tests, together with

arms of the trial. The left panel shows analysis of all randomized patients. The right
panel shows analysis of patients who completed the 6-month trial.

 quality of life, were the main outcome measures of the trial. The
whole program was supervised by the rehabilitation team (University
of Ferrara, Italy) who ensured the education of the dialysis personnel,
as well as exercise performance testing. Training was gradually step-
ped up as described in Table 4. The dialysis personnel received de-
tailed information about the home-based exercise program and
about the physical performance tests, and closely assisted the reha-
bilitation team during the training phase of the trial. Furthermore,
dialysis nurses throughout the whole trial encouraged patients ran-
domized to the exercise arm to keep an adequate adherence to the
exercise prescription, and provided daily feedback to patients, con-
sulting the rehabilitation team whenever required. Even though
members of this team were extraneous to the daily management of
patients on hemodialysis and were in contact with patients and nurses
only during the initial training and in the testing sessions, no special
measure was adopted to keep them blind to patient allocation. The
walking cadence (steps per minute) to be maintained at home was
focused on the use of a low cost (about $25), easily available metro-
nome (Seiko DM50; Seiko Ltd., Japan), distributed to all patients,
who were specifically instructed to walk in rhythm with it. The re-
sidual battery charge in the metronome at the end of the trial was
measured and considered as corollary information to estimate the
adherence to the exercise program.
Functional Capacity Tests
The testing sessions were always arranged on a nondialysis day (see
also Supplemental Material), 24 hours after the dialysis session, either
in the morning (between 7 a.m. and 1 p.m.) or in the afternoon
(between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m.). Functional capacity testing in both
study arms (exercise and control groups) was performed at baseline
and after 6 months, using the 6MWT29 and the 5STS.30
These tests were repeated in both study arms after 6 months.
Patients in the control group were given no recommendation about
physical activity, just generic advice to maintain an active lifestyle.
Quality of Life
Quality of life was measured by the KDQOL-SF in the version trans-
lated into Italian and specifically validated in a sample of Italian

to the KDQOL-SF was helped by nurses unaware of the treatment

Statistical Analyses
The primary outcome of the EXCITE study was functional capacity
changes (from baseline to 6 months) assessed by the 6MWT29 and the
5STS,30 induced by the home-based exercise program and changes in
quality of life as measured by the KDQOL-SF.32–34 The secondary
study outcomes were mortality (all causes and cardiovascular only),
non-fatal cardiovascular events, all-causes hospitalizations and dial-
ysis access survival.
The power of this trial was calculated on the basis of our previous
pilot study.9 In this pilot trial, the same 6-month walking exercise pro-
gram testedinthe present trialinduced a +436118m increase inwalking
distance in 17 patients on hemodialysis, whereas the walking distance
reduced 24676 m in a control group of 14 patients on hemodialysis
who did not exercise during the same period. On the basis of these pilot
data,we calculated that a studyenrolling180 patients(90 per studyarm)
with a 20% attrition rate would have an 80% power to detect statistical
significance (P,0.05, two-tailed), defined as a 40-m difference between
groups in the 6MWD across the trial. Data are expressed as mean and
SD (normally distributed data), median and interquartile range (non-
normally distributed data), or as percentage frequency (binary data),
and comparisons between groups were performed by t-test (normally
distributed data), Mann–Whitney U test (non-normally distributed
data), or chi-squared test (binary data), as appropriate. Within-group
comparisons were done by paired t-test (normally distributed data) or
Wilcoxon rank test (non-normally distributed data), as appropriate.
Between- and within-group differences are expressed as mean change
and 95% CIs.
We used intention-to-treat analyses for both the primary study
outcomes (the 6MWT and the 5STS), as well as for hospitalizations.
Missing longitudinal 6MWTand 5STS data were imputed along with
recommendations made for the analysis of longitudinal data.35
Data analysis was performed using a standard statistical package
(SPSS for Windows, version 9.01 and 21; IBM SPSS, Chicago, IL) as
well as with R 3.0.1. and STATA 11.0.
