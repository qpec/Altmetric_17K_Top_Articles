Safety and tolerability of
sauna detoxification for
the protracted withdrawal
symptoms of substance abuse
Richard D Lennox and
Marie Cecchini-Sternquist
Abstract
Objective: Protracted drug withdrawal symptoms can last months or years after drug cessation,
often precipitating a return to substance misuse. We evaluated the safety and preliminary health
benefits of a unique chemical exposure regimen based on exercise, sauna and therapeu-
tic nutrients.
Methods: This was a prospective evaluation of 109 individuals sequentially enrolled into a sauna
detoxification component of a multi-modal, long-term residential substance abuse treat-
ment centre.
Results: Data from medical charts, client self-reports and Short Form Health Survey (SF-36)
responses indicated that the Hubbard sauna detoxification method was well tolerated, with a 99%
completion rate, including one human immunodeficiency virus and nine hepatitis C positive
clients. There were no cases of dehydration, overhydration or heat illness. Statistically significant
improvements were seen in both mental and physical SF-36 scores at regimen completion, as well
as in Addiction Severity Index and Global Appraisal of Individual Needs Short Screener change
scores at rehabilitation program discharge, compared with enrolment.
Conclusions: The regimen lacked serious adverse events, had a very low discontinuation rate
and high client-reported satisfaction. The SF-36 data indicated improved physical and emotional
symptoms. Therefore, broader investigation of this sauna-based treatment regimen is warranted.

 Introduction
The successful management of addiction
must thoroughly address its multifaceted
disruptive
effects
and
help
people
to
regain
control
of
their
lives.
Current
best practices emphasize a psychosocial
approach with therapeutic adjuncts to pre-
vent relapse. Protracted withdrawal symp-
toms (signs and symptoms that persist,
evolve or appear well past the expected
timeframe for acute withdrawal) can precip-
itate
relapse.
Such
symptoms
include
cravings, disturbances in sleep and mood,
low-level physical discomfort and reduced
cognitive
function
that
persist
for
6 months to many years after achieving
sobriety.1–4
Amelioration of withdrawal symptoms is
important to patients and improves recov-
ery.5 Using the RAND Medical Outcomes
Study Short Form Health Survey (SF-36),
Raish et al.6 found that well-being improves
during the first 4 weeks of substance abuse
treatment, a period that includes the acute
withdrawal phase, but that subsequent SF-
36 scores show little further improvement,
levelling out at or slightly below population
norms. Despite treatment, perception of
well-being in addicted individuals is consis-
tently lower than in the general popula-
tion7,8 and in patients with other serious
chronic illnesses, such as diabetes and
hypertension.9–11
There is limited research on the aetiology
and mechanism(s) that might explain how
symptoms can persist despite a long period
of abstinence. Acknowledging that the pro-
tracted withdrawal syndrome of addiction
may
be
similar
to
exposure
to
other
types of chemicals may improve symp-
tom management.
The US Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention12 recommends the recognition
and treatment of chemical-related illnesses
based
on
clinical
signs
or
patterns.
Multisystem symptoms such as headache,
fatigue, mood changes, sleep disturbances,
achiness, numbness, tingling and other gen-
eralized symptoms are common signs of
chronic exposure.13
Exposure to pesticides, environmental
endocrine disrupters and heavy metals has
striking effects on the dopamine-mediated
reward,
craving-related
and
reinforcing
effects of drugs.14 Through mechanisms
not yet understood, both drugs15,16 and
environmental
chemicals17
cause
neuro-
chemical,
behavioural
and
endocrine
alterations, disrupt cortisol and the hypo-
thalamic–pituitary–adrenal
axis,
and
may
prolong
cravings,
depression
and
dysphagia.18
Cecchini & Lopresti19 presented pilot
evidence that cocaine and benzodiazepine
metabolites can be detected in the sweat
and urine of previously abstinent partici-
pants
undergoing
sauna
detoxification.
The present study is the first large-scale
evaluation of the utility and safety of the
Hubbard sauna regimen for addressing the
effects of illicit drug use.
The Hubbard
detoxification
protocol
combines exercise, nutrient supplementa-
tion and low-temperature sauna to enhance
chemical elimination and improve symp-
toms common to chemical exposures.20
After
the
protocol’s
release
in
1979,
Schnare21 described the regimen’s safety
and
ability to reduce symptoms and
improve mental functioning among individ-
uals with a variety of chemical or illicit drug
exposures. In nearly 40 years of application
of this regimen to occupational or environ-
mental
exposures,
studies
have
shown
statistically
significant
reductions
in
human chemical pollutants, including poly-
chlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and diox-
ins,22,23 and subsequent improvements in
health.24,25
Kilburn
et
al.26
measured
improvements in long-term memory, cogni-
tive dysfunction and peripheral neuropathy
among firefighters who completed sauna
detoxification 6 months after PCB exposure

 from burning transformers. Tsyb et al.27
described the safety and long-term health
improvements in clean-up workers after
the
Chernobyl
disaster.
Ross
&
Sternquist28 described health improvements
and reduced symptoms of chronic neuro-
toxicity
among
police
officers
exposed
to
methamphetamine
during
law-
enforcement activities.
This paper presents the safety profile,
overall client experience, client satisfaction
and functional health outcomes of the
Hubbard
sauna
detoxification
regimen
delivered as one component of a compre-
hensive residential addiction treatment pro-
gram.
The
regimen
has
been
studied
primarily in the context of occupational
and environmental exposures. This is the
first large-scale safety study of the use of
this regimen in aiding recovery from illicit
drug and alcohol misuse.
Methods
This was a prospective chart evaluation of a
convenience sample of 109 clients consecu-
tively enrolled in the sauna regimen known
as the New Life Detoxification Program
(NLDP); one of ten treatment modalities
used in the Narconon residential drug treat-
ment program.29 This paper represents one
aim of a larger outcomes study and was
reviewed
and
approved
by
Chestnut
Health Systems (Bloomington, IL) (IRB
Approval #1078-0912).
Description of the setting, study group,
inclusion and exclusion criteria
The Narconon of Oklahoma facility was
categorized
as
an
ASAM
(American
Society of Addiction) Level-III Clinically
Managed
Low-Intensity
Residential
Service
using
the
American
Society
Placement Criteria for the Treatment of
Substance Abuse Disorders and accredited
by the Commission on Accreditation of
Rehabilitation. Medical oversight was pro-
vided by a doctor of osteopathy with an
addiction
specialty
and
24-hour
nurs-
ing staff.
Narconon
program
exclusion
criteria
were as follows: As medication is not used
as a treatment adjunct, the program does
not accept individuals with a history of
psychosis, extensive psychiatric treatment
or suicide attempts.
Regimen exclusion criteria were as fol-
lows: Women who are pregnant or lactat-
ing; the presence of active cancer (excluding
skin cancer) or current receipt of cancer
treatments; individuals who are wheelchair
bound; individuals with open and infectious
skin lesions; individuals diagnosed with
heart disease or who have cardiac medica-
tion requirements of sufficient severity to
warrant
concern
based
on
physician
discretion; and any medical condition that
contraindicates exercise or exposure to mild
heat stress based on physician discretion.
Under certain circumstances, the doctor
can
recommend
slight
protocol
modifications.
Alcohol, medications, drugs of abuse
and viral hepatitis (a common sequela of
addiction) can cause liver inflammation, as
indicated by elevated liver enzymes. Only
participants
with
liver
enzymes
within
range or minimally elevated can begin the
NLDP. Individuals with liver enzymes well
above the upper limit of normal at enrol-
ment
are
retested
after
3
weeks
of
abstinence, adequate hydration and occa-
sionally provided herbal liver support, usu-
ally OptiCleanseV
R (Xymogen Inc., Orlando,
FL, USA) or milk thistle. If liver enzymes
remain elevated, subsequent tests are per-
formed
weekly
until
the
individual
is
cleared for the NLDP.
Inclusion
criteria
were
as
follows:
Medical examination to assess for exclusion
criteria and provide any participation rec-
ommendations and written consent to par-
ticipate in the research, including release of
4482
Journal of International Medical Research 46(11)
 medical and rehabilitation-related records
for
review.
Two
clients
declined
to
participate.
Summary of the New Life Detoxification
Program (NLDP)
Prior to participating in the NLDP, clients
complete a non-medical withdrawal pro-
gram that includes communication exer-
cises. Following NLDP completion, clients
complete additional behavioural, life skill,
relapse
prevention
and
community
re-
entry steps.
As described by Hubbard20 and Schnare
et al.,21 regimen components include the
following: 1. 20–30 minutes of moderate
aerobic exercise (typically running on a
treadmill
or
equivalent);
2.
gradient
increases of single dose, immediate-release
crystalline niacin, starting at 100 mg per
day and titrated higher based on niacin
flushing and other responses until therapeu-
tic doses are achieved;30–32 3. comprehen-
sive nutritional supplementation; and 4.
moderate-temperature sauna therapy total-
ling about 41=
2 hours daily with frequent
breaks for cooling, hydration and electro-
lyte replenishment.
Trained supervisory staff ensure fidelity;
observe and record the response to niacin;
monitor fluid and electrolyte intake to
avoid dehydration, overhydration, over-
heating and electrolyte deficits; and record
24-hour physical and/or emotional events.
Any injury, potentially infectious symp-
toms, dehydration, heat events or other per-
ceived health risks, including any that
manifest outside of program hours, are
referred to on-site 24-hour medical staff
for evaluation.
Participation is daily. The response to
niacin is patient specific and determines
whether or not the dose will be increased.
Program completion is typically achieved in
2–4 weeks.
The 8–10-person sauna is constructed of
birch
wood
and
equipped
with
flow-
through venting to the outside and a floor
drain. A tempered glass door permits direct
assessment of sauna participants by trained
supervisorial staff. A stable temperature of
60–80�C is produced by granite stones sur-
rounding a ceramic heat coil with a 15,000-
W capacity, (240 V, 62.5 A) and monitored
by regimen staff. Consistent with protocol
specifications,20 the heater emits full spec-
trum infrared wavelengths and matches the
type of sauna conditions that have been
used for thousands of years.33 A non-
toxic, dilute fragrance-free soap solution is
used to clean the sauna daily.
All participants received client orienta-
tion that comprised a description of the reg-
imen steps and theory. As explained above,
when substances are released from bodily
stores, such as fat (adipose), a person may
re-experience to some degree a sensation of
exposure. Clients are instructed to report all
emotional
and
physical
events
on
a
structured Daily Report Form used for
case management.
Supervisory
staff
set
expectations
for
proper
schedules,
sleep,
hydration,
increased
vegetable
intake
and
other
habits in accordance with the physical
rigor that participation in the regimen
demands. All individuals are trained in
basic cleanliness protocols to prevent dis-
ease transfer; additional hygiene steps are
followed for individuals who are positive
for viral hepatitis or human immunodefi-
ciency virus (HIV) antisera.
Outcome measures and analysis
A structured Daily Report Form is com-
pleted for every client during each daily ses-
sion. The NLDP system of ‘measurement-
based care’34 includes client blood pressure
and weight at the start and finish of each
session, exercise duration, sauna duration,
niacin dose and effects, additional vitamins
Lennox and Sternquist
4483
 and doses, quantity of water and electro-
lytes
consumed,
hours
and
quality
of
sleep, and 24-hour physical and emotional
events. Following specific written guide-
lines, these measures guide decisions about
changes to niacin and supporting nutrient
doses, monitor and correct any therapy
drift and monitor client progress through
to completion.
Medical records data includes enrolment
medical examination and drug use report,
comprehensive metabolic panel and com-
plete blood count, HIV and hepatitis anti-
sera
tests,
plus
subjective,
objective,
assessment and plan (SOAP) notes from
any visits to medical personnel during par-
ticipation in the detoxification protocol.
The
SF-3635
measures
health-related
quality of life. The respondent answers 36
questions about how they have felt in the
last 4 weeks. The SF-36 has been validated
as a substance abuse treatment outcomes
measure and clinical tool.36 It provides an
8-scale profile of functional health and well-
being scores as well as psychometrically
based physical and mental health summary
measures,
allowing
for
comparisons
between patients with a wide range of
health problems.34
A
Treatment
Process
Questionnaire
(TPQ) developed for this project assesses
the client’s understanding of each complet-
ed program component, their satisfaction
with it and the perceived benefit to treat-
ment goals. At completion, participants
are also asked to summarize any ‘success’.
The Addiction Severity Index (ASI)37
and the Global Appraisal of Individual
Needs Short Screener (GAIN-SS)38 are
completed by interview at enrolment and
discharge, and will be followed up at 6
months and 1 year as part of a larger
trial. The ASI is a semi-structured, 175-
item interview designed to address seven
potential
problem
areas
in
substance-
abusing patients: medical status, employ-
ment and support, drug use, alcohol use,
legal status, family/social status and psychi-
atric status. The GAIN-SS measures sever-
ity of four independent dimensions of
emotional/behavioural health problems as
well as the recency of the problem in the
past 30 days, past 90 days, during the pre-
vious year or over the lifetime.39
Data extraction
Study staff extracted all physical and emo-
tional events noted on the Daily Report
Forms into Excel spreadsheets, regardless
of whether they were anticipated (e.g. the
flush response to niacin) or unanticipated.
All visits to medical professionals, the
reason for the visit and the findings were
also
tabulated.
Because
the
regimen
requires a 7-day/week rigorous schedule,
data were also compiled for missed treat-
ment days and categorized into medical or
non-medical causes.
Clients
enter
SF-36
and
TPQ
data
(including open-ended, essay-style program
comments) directly into a data-protected
electronic
records
database.
Narconon
staff enter ASI and GAIN-SS interview
answers, program start and end dates,
start and completion dates for each modal-
ity, failure to complete and client-given
reason for not completing. As the records
are
data
protected,
responses
on
each
instrument cannot be changed once entered
and any changes to completion status or
other information entered by Narconon
staff are recorded in a change log.
Data cleaned of identifiers except a
unique study ID were uploaded into SPSS
version 22 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA)
for analysis. The means and standard devi-
ations of test scores were compared before
and after program participation. Statistical
significance was calculated using two-tailed
Student’s t-tests with paired scores for pre/
post comparisons or unpaired scores for
comparison with published SF-36 general
population norms.

 Results
Client demographics and drug use
characteristics
Tables 1 and 2 show the distribution of age,
sex and primary drug of choice of the 109
participants. Two pregnant clients were
ineligible
for
this
component
of
the
Narconon program and their data were
therefore excluded from the results. This
project reviews the remaining 107 individu-
als (33 women and 74 men) enrolled in the
New Life Detoxification portion of the
Narconon program.
HIV and hepatitis antisera, and
liver enzymes
Nine individuals were hepatitis C (HepC)
positive and one was HIV positive. The
HIV positive and all but one of the HepC
positive participants had within-range liver
enzyme profiles; one HepC positive partici-
pant had 174 U/L gamma-glutamyl trans-
ferase
(GGT)
at
enrolment
that
normalized prior to beginning the NLDP.
At program enrolment, four individuals
had aminotransferases (AST and/or ALT)
elevated more than twice the normal range
(109–222U/L and 149–359U/L, respectively)
and one of these individuals also had 209U/L
GGT, all of which normalized with absti-
nence. An additional six individuals had a
GGT range of 151–391 U/L at enrolment,
which normalized with abstinence.
ASI and GAIN-SS scores are presented
to provide a broader understanding of the
clientele
for
potential
comparison
with
other substance abuse populations. Tables
3 and 4 show the ASI and GAIN-SS means
of the 109 participants at baseline (program
intake) and the same statistics for the 76
participants who completed all 10 program
modalities and were discharged. The New
Life Detoxification regimen is an early pro-
gram step followed by a series of behaviou-
ral and life skills modalities. At the time of
data analysis, 13 clients remained active in
the behavioural and life skills portions of
the Narconon program; 18 had discontin-
ued
treatment
without
completing
the
behavioural and life skills series.
Table 3 shows the mean ASI scores. In
the ASI, composite scores are not compared
with each other. In other words, a drug use
score lower than the employment score does
not indicate that employment is a more

Treatment length and completion rates
The length of the full Narconon residential
program averaged 102 days among this
group. As shown in Table 5, the portion
of time in treatment prior to commencing
the NLDP was approximately 2 weeks (14
days) and the NLDP averaged 29 days. The
completion rate for the NLDP was 99%.

*Based on 2-tailed t-test; p-values compared with intake.
GAIN-SS interpretation: a score of 1þ is considered moderate/high for each of the first four screeners; a score above
3 is high on the Total disorder screener. Internalizing disorder suggests a need for mental health treatment related to
somatic complaints, depression, anxiety, trauma, suicide and, at extreme levels, more serious mental illness. Externalizing
disorder suggests a need for mental health treatment related to attention deficits, hyperactivity, impulsivity, conduct
problems and other impulse control disorders. Substance disorder evaluates the need for substance abuse, dependence
and substance use disorder treatment, including the management of withdrawal, maintenance and craving reduction.
Crime/Violence shows the need for help with interpersonal violence, drug-related crimes, property crimes and, in more
extreme cases, interpersonal/violent crimes. Generally, the past-month count is used to measure change; the lifetime
measure is used to predict risk of future remission; higher numbers indicate greater risk of relapse.39

Functioning (SF), Bodily Pain (BP) and
General Health (GH), plus one question
about
perceived
health
change
in
the
last year.
For five of the scales (PF, RP, RE, SF
and BP), a score of 100 indicates the
absence of limitations or disability. On
three scales (EF, EW and GH), a score of
100 indicates a positive state of well-being.
As a guide, a change of 4 points is clinically
significant35.
At
enrolment,
program
participants
reported greater PF scores than RAND
population norms and similar PF and GH
scores, but greater impairment on all other
scales. During the 2-week acute withdrawal
phase, all scale scores improved from base-
line: p < 0.001 for all scales except PF
(p ¼ .027),
RP
(p ¼ 0.003)
and
BP
(p ¼ 0.067) and scores on all scales except
EW and SF approached or exceeded popu-
lation norms.
During the 2–5-week NLDP sauna regi-
men, all scale scores continued to increase
such that post-detoxification scores greatly
exceeded population norms for four scales
(PF, RP, RE and SF), approaching or equal
to 100 (p < 0.001). Change scores on each
scale were greater than improvements mea-
sured during the withdrawal phase.

 Anticipated and unanticipated
discomforts and medical events during
sauna detoxification
The US Food & Drug Administration
defines an adverse event as ‘any undesirable
experience associated with the use of a med-
ical product in a patient’ and provides a list
of what problems are considered serious.40
Table 8 shows the frequency of different
reported events and whether or not the
event led to a medical consultation, missed
treatment day(s) or program discontinua-
tion. The most frequent reason for physi-
cian visits was body aches. Although this
may be regimen-related, it is also a result
of the osteopathic physician–participant
relationship and the convenience of osteo-
pathic manipulations.
Common reasons for missing treatment
days were insufficient sleep (10% of clients),
unrelated medical appointments (10%, usu-
ally off-site; see footnote to Table 8) and
digestive discomfort (7%). Per protocol,
patients who achieve less than 6.5 hours
of sleep have their next day’s treatment
shortened to a minimum of 2.5 hours.
Clients who have had insufficient sleep to
tolerate even a shorter session instead
receive hands-on assistance to remedy the
sleeplessness. As the NLDP regimen is
delivered 7 days a week, some clients have
legal, dental and other appointments that
cannot
be
rescheduled
and
cause
missed days.
Of the 107 eligible individuals, only one
did
not
complete
the
regimen.
Non-
completion was owing to excessive program

aTwo individuals were ‘dope sick’ (with nausea) and one experienced an ‘alcohol hangover’; each had insufficient sleep to
participate in the next day’s session (see note b).
bPer protocol, patients who have less than 6.5 hours of sleep have their next day’s treatment shortened to a minimum of
21=
2 hours. If an individual has not had sufficient sleep to tolerate even this abbreviated treatment, then that individual
entirely skips that day.
cPhysician performs wellness checks and osteopathic manipulative therapies for pain management; these are often
requested. Notable events include one sprained ankle from the running portion of the regimen, two backaches that
created insufficient sleep (one from a pre-existing motorcycle accident, one because the individual elected to skip that day
against advice), and one shoulder ache from a pre-existing injury.
dGastric symptoms from pre-existing hiatal hernia returned during the regimen. Patient had a medical consultation and
then 2 days later missed 1 day when acute symptoms worsened to flu-like symptoms without a fever. Dietary adjustment
over a period of 7 days while continuing the regimen resolved all symptoms.
eT
wo individuals missed 2–3 days owing to court appearance or probation meeting requirements; two individuals took a
day off to visit with family and another missed because of a religious observance. Five individuals scheduled unrelated
medical appointments (see note f).
fAppointments included review of pre-existing high cholesterol test, wellness check, responding to patient questions,
request reduced medication dosage. Missed days: three routine dental appointments and one complicated tooth
extraction followed by 17 missed days before resumption of regimen was possible.
gOne individual repeatedly violated facility regulations and detracted from other participants’ programs. This individual
was referred to a higher level of care after starting this regimen. Additionally, one client returned a positive pregnancy test
2 days after starting the regimen and was discontinued, as this regimen is contraindicated with pregnancy.
hThree individuals noted coloured sweat; two who worked in oil fields described black soot mid-program, a third noted
‘grey resin similar to crack resin’. The fourth individual monitored the movement and subsequent expulsion of a piece of
glass that had been embedded in his forehead for 8 years.

Discussion
Why might a chemical exposure regimen
benefit the substance-abusing population?
Drugs add to the complex toxic chemical milieu
that affects health and behaviour. In terms of
chemical exposures, the concept of detoxifi-
cation,
more
accurately
‘biotransforma-
tion’, refers to the metabolic processes by
which the toxic qualities of a substance
are reduced and then eliminated by the
body, potentially resulting in diminished
symptoms. In substance abuse treatment,
reductions in acute (primarily physical)
symptoms, such as sweating, nausea, rapid
heart rate and intense drug craving, deter-
mine when withdrawal may be considered
clinically complete; this typically occurs in a
few weeks. However, a constellation of
symptoms, including cravings, disturbances
in sleep and mood, anxiety, low-level crav-
ings and reduced cognitive function, can
last months or years.1–4
Like environmental metals and chemi-
cals,41 recreational drugs such as tetrahy-
drocannabinol, opiates and cocaine share
the capacity to be stored in body tissues.19
Metabolic clearance as detected in blood,
urine and oral fluid ceases after a few days
for most illicit drugs but may persist up to 4
weeks for cannabis and cocaine users.42
However, there is limited data regarding
the sequestration to tissues and long-term
storage effects.19 Further, many drugs of
abuse are also contaminated (either during
their manufacture or intentionally) with
chemicals such as additives, metals43 irri-
tants and neurotoxins,44–46 which have the
potential to cause serious health issues.47,48
Chemical compounds that are fat soluble
or have certain ionic structures readily pen-
etrate
the
blood–brain
barrier,
myelin,
axonal membranes and synaptic terminals.
This applies to most medications and illicit
drugs, as well as most pesticides and many
persistent organic pollutants. In addition to
their temporary effects, compounds with
these properties have the potential to alter
the normal activity of the nervous system in
long-term, neurotoxic fashion. Whether or
not the striking changes in architecture and
function49–53 are caused by residual drug or
chemical
stores,
underlying
cellular
changes, or both, is as yet unclear, despite
popularly held beliefs about the safety of
low-level use.
Illicit
substances
and
toxic
chemicals
share
biotransformation pathways. Biotransformation
of both drugs and toxic chemicals involves
members of the large cytochrome P450
family
(CYP),
paraoxonase
(PON1;
involved in the biotransformation of organ-
ophosphate pesticides), glutathione S-trans-
ferase
and
numerous
other
genes
and
enzymes.54–57
Both chemically sensitive and addicted
individuals
have
polymorphisms
in
the
genomic neighbourhoods that regulate the
biochemical breakdown and elimination of
neurotoxic substances such as drugs, metals
and pesticides.58 For example, the well-
characterized
aldehyde
dehydrogenase
(ALDH2) gene alteration increases sensitiv-
ity responses such as flushing and hang-
overs59,60 as well as sensitivity to certain
environmental
chemicals.60
Reduced
ALDH2 enzyme activity elevates acetalde-
hyde, thereby increasing the risk of cellular
damage61 and various cancers,62,63 proba-
bly
via
folate
and
alcohol
metabol-
ic pathways.64
Molecular science research on addiction
susceptibility has identified polymorphisms
potentially related to risk phenotypes repre-
senting both environmental events (e.g.
flushing and other enzymatic pathways)
and psychosocial forces (e.g. impulsivity,
reward pathways and disinhibition).65,66
Cuya
` s et al.67 have shown that CYP2D6
Lennox and Sternquist
4491
 polymorphisms alter 3,4-methylenedioxy-
methamphetamine (MDMA; ‘Ecstasy’) bio-
transformation, which impairs cognitive
function and causes other health effects.
Using a mouse model, Cheng et al.68 have
shown that enhanced expression of the
CYP2D6 detoxification enzyme results in
a heightened ability to adapt to serotonin-
mediated anxiety pathways.
Both
drugs
and
toxic
chemicals
influence
dopamine reward pathways. Exposure to pes-
ticides, environmental endocrine disrupters
and heavy metals has striking effects on the
dopamine-mediated reward, craving and
reinforcing effects of drugs.14 Many of
these effects are caused by chemicals that
bio-accumulate. The most studied oestro-
gen mimetic of this type is bisphenol A
(BPA). BPA exposure during development
heightens adult sensitivity to the reward
effects of opiates.69,70 Animal studies show
that oestrogen-like chemicals modulate the
dopamine-associated
behavioural
and
reward effects of illicit drugs, cocaine and
amphetamines.71,72 Even heavy metal expo-
sure appears to both predispose to later
addiction and increase relapse risk.73
The reactive oxygen species: the nitric oxide–
peroxynitrite cycle. The above mechanisms
are thought to require the presence of a
causative compound. However, the induc-
ible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) pathway
may explain persistent cravings, inflamma-
tion and even disease after environmental
exposure has ceased.
Comprising a family of omnipresent cel-
lular messengers, three NOS isoforms pro-
duce nitric oxide (NO), the physiologic
function of which varies widely depending
on cell type. In a variety of cell types,
including brain astrocytes, N-methyl-D-
aspartate
(NMDA)
receptor-mediated
iNOS activity elevates NO and its down-
stream
product
peroxynitrite
(ONOO–),
leading to progressive hypersensitivity of
local NMDA receptors74,75 and cellular
damage by inhibiting the mitochondrial
respiratory chain, which leads to energy
failure and ultimately cell death.76,77 iNOS
has been shown to interact with both xeno-
biotics and a range of drug compounds75,78
and is implicated in both the cravings and
tolerance
associated
with
a
variety
of
abused substances.79,80
How might the Hubbard regimen produce
improvements in well-being and health?
Nutritional elements of the regimen. Smoking,
drinking and both licit and illicit environ-
mental chemicals increase oxidative stress
and other inflammatory markers.81 The reg-
imen improves the general diet and provides
a broad range of micronutrients that cor-
rect nutrient status and support healing.
Although participants are not asked to
follow a specific dietary regimen, they are
instructed to consume vegetables daily and
consumption is tracked on the Daily Report
Form. Ingestion of fruits and vegetables
provides general protection from the effects
of chemical toxins.82 Increased vegetable
consumption provides nutrients such as
A-lipoic
acid,
which
can
upregulate
ALDH2,83 and isothiocyanates, which act
through a variety of mechanisms, including
epigenetic induction.84
In addition to general dietary improve-
ments, some dietary oils, vitamins and min-
erals help remediate the reaction products
of drug and alcohol degradation, particu-
larly those leading to liver damage (acetal-
dehyde, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
with hydrogen and reactive oxygen species)
and hepatic encephalopathy.85
Crystalline niacin (vitamin B3). A comprehen-
sive
review
of
niacin
mechanisms
is
beyond the scope of this paper; however,
a few key activities warrant discussion.
4492
Journal of International Medical Research 46(11)
 Improved Phase II xenobiotic biotransformation.
Niacin coenzymes, particularly in the form
of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, are
required for more than 500 enzymatic reac-
tions, including biochemical pathways that
modify foreign compounds during their
biotransformation
and
elimination.86,87
Niacin coenzymes may increase the rate of
phase II biotransformation, especially in
the liver, a process by which free radicals
activated during phase I are rapidly conju-
gated with glutathione or other compounds
and rendered less toxic.88
Release of fat-stored compounds into the blood-
stream. Although the regimen does not
involve fasting, early research demonstrated
that fat-stored chemicals are released into
the
bloodstream
when
fatty
acids
are
released during fasting.89,90 Although crys-
talline niacin initially inhibits adipose free
fatty acid release, lipolysis begins approxi-
mately 2 hours after ingestion and is main-
tained for at least 4 hours.91,92 Several
recent studies have replicated the 2–6-hour
niacin-mediated release of free fatty acids
and explored niacin’s beneficial utility in
cardiovascular disease by correcting serum
lipid profiles by reducing concentrations
of very low-density lipoprotein triglyceride
and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and
increasing high-density lipoprotein choles-
terol.93–95
Sauna
and
exercise
influence
physiological
states. Many studies show the benefits of
exercise in promoting deep circulation in
the tissues and mobilizing lipid from stor-
age depots.96–99 Both processes aid tissue
oxygenation, nutrient status and healing.
Kukkonen-Harjula100 has suggested that
sauna induces subtle endocrine changes,
including raised noradrenaline and beta-
endorphin levels and activation of the
renin–angiotensin–aldosterone
system.
Although these changes usually normalize
post-treatment, they may partially explain
the physical relief described by participants.
Interestingly, sauna therapy and exercise
both lower NO levels by upregulating tetra-
hydrobiopterin (BH4) production in vascu-
lar tissues as well as through a heat-shock
protein-mediated
(Hsp90)
pathway
that
slows BH4 degradation. Increased availabil-
ity of BH4 leads to lower NO levels.101
Limitations
This was an uncontrolled, pre–post, inter-
vention
safety
study
of
a
convenience
sample participating in the NLDP sauna
regimen as one component of a multi-
modal residential substance abuse treat-
ment program that emphasizes behavioural
change and life skills. The reported out-
come changes should be interpreted with
caution.
Pre–post-sauna
detoxification
improvements
in health and well-being
may be a result of the regimen; however,
without a comparison group, it is impossi-
ble to know how much change might have
occurred over the same length of time from
continued sobriety, strong expectations or
placebo effect. Intensive daily contact, exer-
cise and improved nutrition may account
for improvements regardless of actual elim-
ination of residual drug metabolites, which
was not demonstrated or quantified in this
study. ASI and GAIN-SS scores were not
obtained immediately before or after the
NLDP, only at enrolment and discharge
for the full program, of which the NLDP
is an early component. Future work will
measure
the
observed
health
changes
more precisely.
Future controlled studies should address
these limitations and examine the mecha-
nisms of action underlying the measured
improvements. These could include validat-
ed measurement tools to capture changes in
cognitive function, craving and symptoms
associated with protracted withdrawal, as
Lennox and Sternquist
4493
 well as forensic-quality testing for drug
metabolite release.
Conclusions
To our knowledge, this is the first large
study of a sauna-based chemical detoxifica-
tion program provided as part of a sub-
stance abuse treatment program. Most of
the anticipated and unanticipated events
experienced during this regimen were tran-
sient discomforts. There were no serious
medical complications and the program
was tolerated well even by individuals with
hepatic stresses, if they were given enough
abstinence time to permit the liver to begin
to heal. The level of client orientation
appeared appropriate and sets expectations
for managing the anticipated non-harmful
flush
associated
with
immediate-release
niacin, as well as the discomforts that cli-
ents associate with past drug use or chemi-
cal exposures.
Completion of the NLDP was accompa-
nied by measurably improved functional
health and well-being in both physical and
emotional domains. On some SF-36 scales,
these
improvements
were
greater
than
improvements measured during the prior 2
weeks, on average, of acute withdrawal; a
phase completed when nursing staff autho-
rize medical release after physical with-
drawal symptoms subside. As continued
low motivation, physical pain and discom-
fort, cognitive fogginess, emotional difficul-
ties, low-level cravings and disturbances in
sleep are among the key triggers for drug
relapse after treatment, additional improve-
ments in these areas may be important for
stable recovery.
Participants expressed high levels of sat-
isfaction with the regimen, noting improved
energy, mental clarity, emotional stability,
reduced cravings, greater well-being and a
positive life outlook.
Owing to the prevalence of recurrent
addiction
cycles
and
the
associated
enormous cost and social consequences,
the safety and beneficial health effects of
the sauna-based Hubbard detoxification
protocol demonstrated here suggest the
need
for
additional
studies.
Important
issues that remain unresolved include addi-
tional measurements of physical and mental
health changes and investigation of whether
these are improved through toxic elimina-
tion,
nutrient
and
systems
restoration
or both.
