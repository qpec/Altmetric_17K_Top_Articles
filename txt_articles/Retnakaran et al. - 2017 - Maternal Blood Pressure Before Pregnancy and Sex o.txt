The possibility of predicting the sex of the baby in early preg-
nancy has long been a topic of public fascination, spawn-
ing numerous theories of maternal characteristics associated 
with the presence of a male or female fetus, none of which 
has been conclusively supported by robust scientific evi-
dence.1 Researchers have long recognized that the sex ratio 
at birth in human populations typically shows a slight 
male preponderance, the determinants of which are poorly 
understood.1–3 Interestingly, population-level sociologic 
studies have suggested that this sex ratio can be modified by 
adverse societal conditions, likely reflecting sex-specific dif-
ferences in fetal vulnerability during gestation.4,5 For exam-
ple, population stressors such as natural and man-made 
disasters,6,7 terrorist attacks,8 and economic collapse9 have 
all been reported to decrease the proportion of boys at birth, 
potentially due to greater spontaneous loss of male fetuses 
under these adverse conditions.4,5 These observations raise 
the possibility that there may be underlying physiologic fea-
tures in a woman that relate to her likelihood of sex-specific 
fetal loss and hence her likelihood of delivering a boy or girl.

BACKGROUND
Population-level sociologic studies have suggested that adverse soci-
etal conditions may affect fetal viability in a sex-specific manner and 
thereby modify the ratio of male vs. female babies. This concept sug-
gests that there may exist certain physiologic features in a woman that 
relate to her likelihood of delivering a boy or girl. We thus established 
a preconception cohort to prospectively evaluate the relationship 
between maternal pregravid health and sex of the baby.
METHODS
In this analysis nested within an observational cohort study, 1,411 newly 
married women in Liuyang, China, underwent pregravid cardiometa-
bolic characterization (including anthropometry and measurement of 
blood pressure, cholesterol, triglycerides, and glucose) at median 26.3 
weeks before a singleton pregnancy, delivering at 39.0 ± 1.3 weeks 
gestation.
RESULTS
Systolic blood pressure before pregnancy was higher in women 
who delivered a boy than in those who had a girl (112.5 ± 11.9 vs. 
109.6 ± 12.0 mm Hg, P < 0.0001). The prevalence of a male baby pro-
gressively increased across quintiles of pregravid systolic blood pres-
sure (P < 0.0001). After covariate adjustment, mean adjusted pregravid 
systolic blood pressure was higher in mothers of boys vs. girls (106.0 
vs. 103.3 mm Hg, P = 0.0015). On logistic regression analysis, pregravid 
systolic blood pressure emerged as the only significant predictor of 
having a male baby (adjusted odds ratio = 1.017 per mm Hg, 95% con-
fidence interval = 1.007–1.028). The pregravid difference in blood pres-
sure between mothers of boys and girls was not present during any 
trimester of pregnancy.
CONCLUSION
Maternal blood pressure before pregnancy is a previously unrecog-
nized factor that may be associated with the likelihood of delivering 
a boy or girl.

Maternal Pregravid BP and Infant Sex
However, little is known about such factors in humans.10,11 
Thus, in this context, we established a unique preconcep-
tion cohort consisting of young women who were planning 
to have a pregnancy in the near future and used this model 
to prospectively evaluate the relationship between maternal 
pregravid health and sex of the baby.
METHODS
The current analysis was nested within a prospective pre-
conception cohort study, in which women were recruited at 
the time of marriage in the Liuyang region of Hunan prov-
ince in China. Participants underwent baseline cardiometa-
bolic characterization at recruitment and then, whenever 
they subsequently became pregnant, were followed across 
the pregnancy up to delivery through their clinical care. 
Beginning in February 2009, 3,375 women were recruited 
into this cohort, of whom 2,382 have completed a pregnancy. 
Of these, 1,692 women had complete pregravid blood pres-
sure measurements and delivery data with a singleton preg-
nancy. After the exclusion of 281 women who were potentially 
pregnant at their baseline assessment based on back-dating 
of the length of gestation at delivery, the study population 
for the current analysis consisted of 1,411 women. The study 
has been approved by the institutional research ethics boards 
of Central South University (Changsha, Hunan, China), 
Ottawa Hospital Research Institute (Ottawa, Canada), and 
Mount Sinai Hospital (Toronto, Canada), and all partici-
pants provided written informed consent.
Recruitment and pregravid assessment
The cost-efficient formation of a preconception cohort 
requires the capacity to identify women who are likely to 
get pregnant in the near future. The Liuyang Maternal and 
Infant Hospital was specifically selected for the current study 
because women in its catchment area typically attend a pre-
marriage health clinic for assessment at the time of marriage 
registration. Thus, women who were planning to have a baby 
in the next 6 months were recruited from these clinics to 
participate in the cohort. After recruitment, participants 
were asked to undergo an overnight fast and then attend a 
baseline assessment that consisted of interviewer-adminis-
tered questionnaires (regarding demographics, lifestyle, and 
medical history), physical examination, and the drawing of 
venous blood samples for biochemical analyses. At the base-
line study visit, anthropometric measurements were per-
formed by trained research staff, including weight, height, 
waist circumference, and calculated body mass index. Blood 
pressure was measured in a seated position, after 10 minutes 
of rest, using automated noninvasive blood pressure moni-
tors (BpTRU). Two measurements were performed 10 min-
utes apart, with the average recorded.
Blood samples were drawn from the women and placed 
on ice immediately, transported to the laboratory within 
30 minutes, and centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 10 minutes at 
4 °C. Biochemical tests were performed in the central labo-
ratory of Central South University. Total cholesterol, high-
density-lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and glucose 
 
were measured by standard clinical biochemistry. Low-
density-lipoprotein 
cholesterol 
was 
determined 
by 
Friedewald equation.
Assessments during pregnancy and at delivery
Once pregnant, participants received obstetrical care 
through clinical services at Liuyang Maternal and Infant 
Hospital. Blood pressure measurements during gesta-
tion and the diagnosis of medical complications in preg-
nancy (gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia) were obtained 
through this clinical care. Data collected at delivery 
included length of gestation, infant sex, birthweight, and 
Apgar scores.
Statistical analyses
All analyses were conducted using SAS.9.4 (SAS Institute, 
Cary, NC). Univariate differences between women who 
delivered a boy and those who delivered a girl were assessed 
by 2-sample t-test for normally distributed continuous vari-
ables, Wilcoxon 2-sample test for skewed variables, and 
chi-square or fisher test for categorical variables (Table 1). 
Multiple linear regression models were constructed to deter-
mine whether the difference in pregravid blood pressure 
between the 2 groups persists after adjustment for age, edu-
cation, smoking, body mass index, waist, low-density-lipo-
protein cholesterol, high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol, 
triglycerides, and glucose.
We used the chi-square test to determine if there was 
a difference in the prevalence of male baby across quin-
tiles of pregravid systolic blood pressure (quintile ranges 
in mm Hg: 80–99, 100–107, 108–114, 115–120, 121–171)
(Figure 1a). We then constructed a multiple logistic regres-
sion model with male baby as dependent variable, with the 
same covariates as in the multiple linear regression models 
above. Based on the fitted logit response function, the pre-
dicted probability and odds for having a boy were calculated 
at each level of observed pregravid systolic blood pressure. 
LOESS method was used with local quadratic polynomials 
for each local regression and cubic polynomials for blend-
ing local polynomial fits (to minimize corrected akaike 
information criterion) to generate a spline plot of the pre-
dicted odds for having a boy vs. pregravid systolic blood 
pressure (Figure 1b). Multiple logistic regression analysis 
was performed to identify independent determinants of 
delivering a boy, adjusting for the same covariates as above 
(Table 2).
To evaluate if the pregravid difference in blood pressure 
between women delivering a boy and those delivering a girl 
persists during pregnancy (Figure 2), we plotted mean sys-
tolic blood pressure within 2 pregravid and 11 antepartum 
intervals (defined by weeks gestation, recognizing that par-
ticipants have varying numbers of blood pressure measure-
ments at varying weeks gestation). If a participant had >1 
measurement within an interval, the average systolic blood 
pressure from these measurements was determined. The 
2-sample t-test was used to compare mean systolic blood 
pressure in each interval between the groups.

RESULTS
The study population consisted of 1,411 women who 
underwent pregravid assessment at median 26.3 weeks 
before a singleton pregnancy. Their pregnancies resulted 
in the delivery of 739 boys and 672 girls at mean 39.0 ± 1.3 
weeks gestation. At their baseline pregravid assessment, the 
women who gave birth to a boy and those who delivered 
a girl had no differences in age, education, smoking, body 
mass index, waist circumference, cholesterol, triglycerides, 
glucose, or pre-existing hypertension or diabetes (Table 1). 
Of note, however, both systolic blood pressure (112.5 ± 11.9 
vs. 109.6 ± 12.0 mm Hg, P < 0.0001) and diastolic blood 
pressure (71.7 ± 8.7 vs. 70.4 ± 8.8 mm Hg, P = 0.005) were 
higher in the women who subsequently had a boy, as com-
pared to those who delivered a girl.
Stratification of the study population into quintiles based 
on pregravid systolic blood pressure revealed a progressive 
increase in the prevalence of a male baby from the lowest to the 
highest quintile (43.4% to 46.0% to 51.2% to 58.0% to 61.2%)
(Figure 1a). There was a significant difference in the prevalence 
of a male baby across the quintiles (P < 0.0001). After adjust-
ment for age, education, smoking, body mass index, waist, 
low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density-lipoprotein 
cholesterol, triglycerides, and glucose, mean adjusted systolic 
blood pressure was higher in women who subsequently had 
a boy than in those who delivered a girl (106.0 vs. 103.3 mm 
Hg, P = 0.0015). With analogous covariate adjustment, mean 
adjusted diastolic blood pressure was only slightly higher 
in those who had a boy, at borderline significance (68.9 vs. 
67.8 mm Hg, P = 0.065). It thus appears that systolic blood 
pressure, rather than diastolic, was more strongly linked to the 
sex of the neonate. Figure 1b is a spline plot showing a positive 
association between maternal pregravid systolic blood pres-
sure and the odds of having a boy, after adjustment for the 
same baseline covariates. There was no difference in the likeli-
hood of delivering a boy vs. a girl at maternal pregravid systolic 
blood pressure of 100 mm Hg. Above this threshold, there was 
a higher likelihood of having a boy and, below this thresh-
old, there was a greater chance of having a girl. For example, 
as shown in Figure 1b, at a pregravid systolic blood pressure 
of 123 mm Hg, the probability of having a boy was 1.5 times 
greater than the probability of having a girl.
On logistic regression analysis of maternal character-
istics prior to pregnancy (Table 2), systolic blood pressure

emerged as the only significant predictor of having a male 
baby (adjusted odds ratio = 1.017 per mm Hg, 95% confi-
dence interval = 1.007–1.028). Furthermore, systolic blood 
pressure remained the sole pregravid predictor of delivery 
of a male baby in a series of sensitivity analyses. The logistic 
regression models in these sensitivity analyses included the 
following conditions: (i) inclusion of passive smoke exposure 
in place of personal smoking, (ii) addition of diastolic blood 
pressure, (iii) further adjustment for time from baseline 
assessment to pregnancy, and (iv) exclusion of the women 
who had pre-existing hypertension (data not shown).
Of the 1,411 participants, 877 had blood pressure meas-
urements recorded during pregnancy. These antepartum data 
ranged from 1 to 13 measurements across gestation, with 800 
women having at least 5 such blood pressure measurements. 
In assessments at either >26 weeks pregravid or between 0 
and 26 weeks prior to the pregnancy, mean systolic blood 
pressure was higher in those who went on to deliver a boy 
(P = 0.009 and P = 0.001, respectively) (Figure 2). At all of the 
subsequent time points during the pregnancy, however, there 
was no difference in systolic blood pressure between women 
who delivered a boy and those who had a girl (Figure 2).
DISCUSSION
In humans, the sex of the fetus is determined by the sex 
chromosome of the fertilizing sperm. Although the propor-
tion of spermatozoa carrying a Y-chromosome (yielding a 
male fetus) is similar to that carrying an X-chromosome 
(producing a female),12 there is typically a slight prepon-
derance of boys at delivery, the biologic basis for which is 
unclear.1,2 The observation that societal stressors (disasters, 
terrorism, economic collapse)6–9 may reduce the proportion 
of boys born into a population has led to the “culled cohort” 
theory, which posits that there is greater spontaneous loss of 
frail male fetuses in response to such adverse conditions.4,5

trajectory of the human sex ratio from conception to birth,

Retnakaran et al.
Orzack et al. recently reported that the sex ratio actually var-
ies across gestation.13 Specifically, the sex ratio is balanced 
at conception followed by male-biased fetal mortality in 
the first 2 weeks of gestation, female-biased mortality over 
the next 4 months, and then balanced mortality thereafter 
until greater loss of males in the last 5 weeks of gestation.13 
Overall, they found that total female mortality exceeds total 
male mortality in utero.13 It thus appears that sex-biased 
fetal loss is likely a determinant of the proportion of boys 
and girls born in a population. Maternal physiologic char-
acteristics that potentially may relate to such loss, however, 
have been unclear.
In this context, there has previously been interest in mater-
nal diet as a possible determinant.3,11 Evolutionary biologists 
have hypothesized that female mammals are able to modify 
the sex ratio of the offspring in response to their mater-
nal condition such that healthy and well-nourished mam-
mals are more likely to give birth to sons.14 In experimental 
studies, female mice receiving a high-fat/low-carbohydrate 
diet have been shown to produce more sons, whereas those 
receiving a low-fat/high-carbohydrate diet have more female 
offspring.3,11 However, studies to date have not yielded con-
sistent findings to support an effect of maternal diet on neo-
natal sex in humans.15–19 In a study of 740 women, higher 
preconceptional energy intake (on retrospective recall) was 
associated with a greater incidence of boys,15 although the 
statistical validity of this finding has been questioned.16 
Similarly, conflicting findings have been reported on the 
respective effects of both famine and war on the population 
sex ratio.17–21 At present, the impact, if any, of maternal diet 
on neonatal sex in humans thus remains unclear.
One of the limiting factors in previous human studies has 
been the reliance on retrospective study designs. In this con-
text, the preconception cohort design of the current study 
provided the unique opportunity to systematically evalu-
ate maternal cardiometabolic status in a prospective man-
ner shortly before pregnancy. In doing so, this analysis has 
revealed that directly measured pregravid systolic blood 
pressure differs between women who go on to deliver a boy 
and those who have a girl. The robustness of this novel find-
ing is highlighted in 3 ways. First, the difference in blood 
pressure was sizable (almost 3 mm Hg) both before and after 
covariate adjustment. Second, on a series of logistic regres-
sion analyses, pregravid systolic blood pressure consistently 
emerged as the only significant predictor of the sex of the 
baby, with no other maternal characteristics nearing any 
such association. Third, the pregravid difference in systolic 
blood pressure between future mothers of boys and girls was 
readily apparent prior to gestation but was not evident at any 
time during pregnancy (Figure 2). Taken together, these data 
specifically implicate maternal blood pressure prior to the 
pregnancy as a predictor of the sex of the neonate.
The mechanism by which pregravid blood pressure may 
relate to neonatal sex is unclear. In this regard, the apparent 
specificity of the blood pressure difference between moth-
ers of sons and daughters to the pregravid state (i.e., the 
absence of this difference during gestation) potentially may 
implicate fetal sex-specific attrition in early pregnancy. Of 
note, the aforementioned study by Orzack et al. reported 
male-biased fetal mortality in the first 2 weeks of gesta-
tion followed by female-biased mortality over the next 
4 months.13 Moreover, there are differences in early pla-
centation depending on the sex of the fetus, as apparent 
in sex-specific gradients in placental biomarkers.22 Given 
that changes in maternal vascular function are needed 
in early pregnancy to accommodate the increased blood 
flow required by the fetoplacental unit,23 maternal blood 
pressure potentially may be relevant to early placentation 
in a sex-specific manner. While sex-specific attrition may 
indeed be the mechanistic basis underlying the current 
findings, it should be noted that our data cannot differenti-
ate between a lesser capacity of the female fetus to tolerate 
higher systolic pressures or an inability of the male fetus 
to tolerate lower pressures. Further research will thus be 
needed to evaluate the potential sex-specific implications 
of maternal pregravid blood pressure on the physiology of 
the fetus. In addition, as shown in Figure 2, women who 
delivered a boy may have had a larger early pregnancy drop 
in systolic blood pressure from their pregravid measure-
ment than did those who delivered a girl. It is possible 
that this difference may reflect a fetal sex-specific effect on 
maternal vascular adaptation to pregnancy. Evaluation of 
Figure 2. Time from baseline assessment to pregnancy was missing in 56 women. For each interval, the lower bound is inclusive and the upper bound 
is exclusive. Comparison of mean systolic blood pressure at the following points in time between women who delivered a boy and those who delivered 
a girl: >26 weeks pregravid, 0–26 weeks pregravid, <12 weeks gestation, 12–16 weeks gestation, 16–20 weeks gestation, 20–24 weeks gestation, 24–28 
weeks gestation, 28–32 weeks gestation, 32–34 weeks gestation, 34–36 weeks gestation, 36–38 weeks gestation, 38–40 weeks gestation, and >40 weeks 
gestation.

Maternal Pregravid BP and Infant Sex
the relationship between fetal sex and maternal vascular 
adaptation is thus needed.
A limitation of this study is the absence of data on the 
use of antihypertensive medications by the participants. 
However, only 9 women had a history of hypertension at 
baseline and the findings were unchanged upon their exclu-
sion. Another limitation is the absence of data on spontane-
ous miscarriages, the fetal sex ratio of which at specific weeks 
of gestation would be of great interest. In addition, the study 
population largely consisted of young, healthy normal weight 
women such that the generalizability of the findings to older, 
less healthy women with higher body weight remains to be 
determined. Moreover, the study was conducted only in 
Chinese women and hence replication of the findings should 
be sought in other populations. Nevertheless, as described 
in the Methods section, the choice of Liuyang as the loca-
tion of this study was critical in enabling the cost-effective 
formation of a preconception cohort of young women who 
were likely to have a pregnancy in the near future. This pre-
conception cohort has provided a unique model that made 
it possible to identify the relationship between pregravid 
maternal blood pressure and sex of the baby.
Our findings hold both clinical and research implications. 
Clinically, the identification of a pregravid systolic blood 
pressure threshold in this population above which the prob-
ability of having a boy may be enhanced or below which one 
may be more likely to deliver a girl raises the possibility of 
blood pressure modification prior to pregnancy for the pur-
pose of influencing one’s likelihood of having a child of a 
particular sex. While the feasibility of such action remains 
to be established, this possibility could be particularly prob-
lematic and potentially dangerous in populations which may 
favor the birth of one sex over the other. From a research 
perspective, the current findings suggest that maternal blood 
pressure warrants study for sex-specific effects on fetal phys-
iology and viability. The insight so derived potentially may 
help to elucidate mechanistic determinants of the sex ratio 
after conception. Finally, a declining proportion of male 
births in industrialized countries (United States, Canada, 
Denmark, Netherlands) over the past several decades has 
been queried as a possible sentinel health indicator.24 Our 
findings suggest that growing societal emphasis on healthy 
lifestyles and a resultant beneficial impact on blood pressure 
in young women (a trend that has been documented glob-
ally over the past 30 years)25 may warrant consideration as a 
potential contributor in this regard.
In summary, maternal pregravid systolic blood pres-
sure is a previously unrecognized factor associated with 
the likelihood of having a boy or girl in a subsequent preg-
nancy. Higher systolic blood pressure before pregnancy is 
a robust independent predictor of delivering a male baby. 
Furthermore, this relationship reveals a threshold for mater-
nal pregravid systolic blood pressure above/below which 
the probability of delivering a boy/girl, respectively, may 
be favored. This novel insight suggests the existence of fetal 
sex-specific effects of maternal blood pressure that may hold 
implications for both reproductive planning and our under-
standing of the fundamental mechanisms underlying the sex 
ratio in humans.
