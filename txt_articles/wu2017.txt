IMPORTANCE Acupuncture is used to induce ovulation in some women with polycystic ovary
syndrome, without supporting clinical evidence.
OBJECTIVE To assess whether active acupuncture, either alone or combined with clomiphene,
increases the likelihood of live births among women with polycystic ovary syndrome.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A double-blind (clomiphene vs placebo), single-blind
(active vs control acupuncture) factorial trial was conducted at 21 sites (27 hospitals) in
mainland China between July 6, 2012, and November 18, 2014, with 10 months of pregnancy
follow-up until October 7, 2015. Chinese women with polycystic ovary syndrome were
randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to 4 groups.
INTERVENTIONS Active or control acupuncture administered twice a week for 30 minutes per
treatment and clomiphene or placebo administered for 5 days per cycle, for up to 4 cycles.
The active acupuncture group received deep needle insertion with combined manual and
low-frequency electrical stimulation; the control acupuncture group received superficial
needle insertion, no manual stimulation, and mock electricity.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was live birth. Secondary outcomes
included adverse events.
RESULTS Among the 1000 randomized women (mean [SD] age, 27.9 [3.3] years; mean [SD]
body mass index, 24.2 [4.3]), 250 were randomized to each group; a total of 926 women
(92.6%) completed the trial. Live births occurred in 69 of 235 women (29.4%) in the active
acupuncture plus clomiphene group, 66 of 236 (28.0%) in the control acupuncture plus
clomiphene group, 31 of 223 (13.9%) in the active acupuncture plus placebo group, and 39 of
232 (16.8%) in the control acupuncture plus placebo group. There was no significant
interaction between active acupuncture and clomiphene (P = .39), so main effects were
evaluated. The live birth rate was significantly higher in the women treated with clomiphene
than with placebo (135 of 471 [28.7%] vs 70 of 455 [15.4%], respectively; difference, 13.3%;
95% CI, 8.0% to 18.5%) and not significantly different between women treated with active vs
control acupuncture (100 of 458 [21.8%] vs 105 of 468 [22.4%], respectively; difference,
−0.6%; 95% CI, −5.9% to 4.7%). Diarrhea and bruising were more common in patients
receiving active acupuncture than control acupuncture (diarrhea: 25 of 500 [5.0%] vs 8 of
500 [1.6%], respectively; difference, 3.4%; 95% CI, 1.2% to 5.6%; bruising: 37 of 500 [7.4%]
vs 9 of 500 [1.8%], respectively; difference, 5.6%; 95% CI, 3.0% to 8.2%).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among Chinese women with polycystic ovary syndrome, the
use of acupuncture with or without clomiphene, compared with control acupuncture and
placebo, did not increase live births. This finding does not support acupuncture as an
infertility treatment in such women.

 P
olycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), the most common
cause of anovulatory infertility, is characterized by ovu-
latory dysfunction, hyperandrogenism, and polycys-
tic ovaries.1 It is reported to affect 5% to 10% of women of
reproductive age.2
Clomiphene citrate is a first-line, inexpensive treatment
to induce ovulation in women with PCOS.3,4 However, clomi-
phene had a high failure rate of 23.4% without ovulation af-
ter 5 months of use, a relatively low cumulative live birth rate
of 19.1% after 5 months, and a high multiple-pregnancy
rate (7.4%) among 750 women with PCOS in 2014.4 Thus,
new or adjuvant treatments would be desirable for this
population.5 One such treatment is acupuncture, an integral
part of traditional Chinese medicine, which has gained in-
creasedpopularity.6Therearefewstudiesindicatingthepreva-
lence of use of acupuncture among patients seeking infertil-
ity treatment. A 2010 prevalence study from the United States
including 8 community and academic infertility practices re-
ported that 29% of their patients had used a complementary
and alternative medicine treatment for infertility and 22%
had tried acupuncture.7 Clinical trials from different coun-
tries indicate that acupuncture may improve reproductive
function.8-15 However, these acupuncture trials provide insuf-
ficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of acupunc-
ture to induce ovulation or treat infertility in PCOS because of
failure to report important clinical outcomes such as live birth
andlimitationsinqualityandprecision.6Methodologicalprob-
lems include small sample size and insufficient information
on allocation concealment. Thus, there is need for a multi-
center randomized clinical trial on the use of acupuncture in
this condition.
The PCOS Acupuncture and Clomiphene Trial (PCOSAct)
investigatedtheeffectsofacupunctureandclomipheneonlive
births among Chinese women with PCOS.
Methods
Study Design
The PCOSAct was a randomized, multicenter, clinical trial un-
dertaken at 21 sites (27 hospitals) in the National Clinical Trial
BaseofChineseMedicineinGynecologyfrommainlandChina.
The PCOSAct was designed as a 2 × 2 factorial trial to exam-
ine the effects of active acupuncture (or control acupunc-
ture) and clomiphene (or placebo) on live births. Details of the
study design, rationale for the primary and secondary out-
come measures, power analyses, and the statistical analysis
plan have been previously published.16 The full trial protocol
is available in Supplement 1. The institutional review boards
at the local sites approved the protocol, and all patients to-
gether with their partners provided written informed con-
sent before joining the study. The study was chaired by a mul-
tidisciplinary steering committee and overseen by an
international data and safety monitoring board.
Participants
All patients fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for PCOS accord-
ing to the modified Rotterdam criteria1,17: oligomenorrhea
or amenorrhea, together with clinical or biochemical
hyperandrogenism (modified Ferriman-Gallwey hirsutism
score ≥5 in Chinese),18,19 polycystic ovaries, or both. Inclu-
sion and exclusion criteria are summarized in the eAppendix
in Supplement 2. Metabolic syndrome was defined by meet-
ing any 3 of the following 5 criteria: (1) waist circumference
greater than 88 cm; (2) triglycerides level greater than
150 mg/dL (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by
0.0113); (3) high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level lower
than 50 mg/dL (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by
0.0259); (4) systolic blood pressure greater than 130 mm Hg
or diastolic blood pressure greater than 85 mm Hg; and
(5) fasting glucose level of 110 to 126 mg/dL (to convert to mil-
limoles per liter, multiply by 0.0555).1 Body mass index (BMI;
calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters
squared) was categorized as normal if less than 24, over-
weight if 24 or greater but less than 28, and obese if greater
than 28, as defined in Chinese women.20 All couples agreed
to have regular intercourse during the study period with the
intent of conception, and patients were in good health with-
out major medical disorders. Baseline laboratory, anthropo-
metric, and clinical measurements including scoring of hir-
sutism, acne, and ultrasonography were performed after an
overnight fast. All biochemical assays were performed in a
core laboratory (eAppendix in Supplement 2).
Randomization and Blinding
Participants were randomly allocated in a ratio of 1:1:1:1 into
1 of 4 intervention groups: active acupuncture plus clomi-
phene, control acupuncture plus clomiphene, active acupunc-
ture plus placebo, and control acupuncture plus placebo
(Figure 1) by an interactive online computer program (ResMan
Research Manager; http://www.medresman.org) in a central
office. The randomization was stratified within 21 participat-
ing sites and defined with a random block size of 4 or 8
(concealed from the investigators) by the head of the data
coordination committee (H.Z.) (eTable 1 in Supplement 2). The
statisticians generated and validated the randomization
scheme for the study using the Plan procedure in SAS version
9.3software(SASInstitute,Inc).Wepreprinted1000labelswith

Key Points
Question Does acupuncture alone or combined with clomiphene
increase the likelihood of live births among women with polycystic
ovary syndrome?
Findings In this randomized clinical trial that recruited 1000
Chinese women with polycystic ovary syndrome, the live birth rate
was significantly higher in the group of women who received
clomiphene compared with placebo (28.7% vs 15.4%,
respectively). However, it was not significantly different between
the groups who received active vs control acupuncture (21.8% vs
22.4%, respectively), and there was no significant interaction
between active acupuncture and clomiphene.
Meaning Acupuncture, alone or with clomiphene, was not
effective as an infertility treatment in women with polycystic ovary
syndrome.

 bottles. The bottles were distributed to sites and assigned to
patients as they were enrolled. This approach ensured that the
randomization was stratified by site and that there would be
250 patients per group. The clomiphene and placebo assign-
ments were double-blinded, unknown to patients and study
investigators except the data manager. The active and control
acupuncture treatments were known only to acupuncturists
and the data manager at each site.
Interventions
For a more detailed description of the study interventions, see
the eAppendix in Supplement 2.
Active or Control Acupuncture
The acupuncture treatment was standardized. All patients re-
ceived acupuncture treatment for 30 minutes twice weekly,
with a maximum of 32 acupuncture treatments.

 In the active acupuncture protocol, 2 sets of acupuncture
pointswerealternatedeveryothertreatmenttominimizesore-
ness at the needle placement (eTable 2 and eFigure in
Supplement 2). Acupuncture points were located in abdomi-
nal muscles and leg muscles (with somatic innervation com-
mon to the autonomic innervation of the ovaries and the
uterus20) and in the hands and head. When placed, all needles
were stimulated by manual rotation until the tingling sensa-
tion called de qi was achieved. Needle sensation reflects acti-
vation of the afferent nerve fibers projecting to the central ner-
vous system at the spinal and central levels. Needles placed
in the hand and head were manually stimulated every 10 min-
utes. Needles in abdominal and leg muscles were manually ro-
tatedandthenconnectedtoanelectricalstimulatorandstimu-
lated with low frequency.
In the control acupuncture protocol, 2 needles were in-
serted superficially to a depth of less than 5 mm, 1 in each
shoulder and 1 in each upper arm at nonacupuncture points,
and needles were not stimulated manually when inserted
(eTable 2 and eFigure in Supplement 2). Thereafter, the 4
needles were attached to electrodes and the stimulator was
turned on to mimic the active acupuncture but with zero in-
tensity, ie, no electrical stimulation.
Clomiphene or Placebo
Patients started with an initial oral dose of 1 pill of clomi-
phene (50 mg) or placebo from days 3 to 7 of the menstrual
cycle. The dosage of oral medication was increased by 1 pill
in the absence of ovulation or maintained in the presence of
ovulation. The maximum dosage of clomiphene or placebo did
not exceed 150 mg per day or 750 mg per cycle.3 The treat-
ment could be repeated for up to 4 cycles.
After the baseline visit, acupuncture treatment and clo-
miphene treatment were started on day 3 of a spontaneous
menstrual period. In patients with irregular cycles without re-
cent menses, withdrawal bleeding was induced by medroxy-
progesterone acetate, 5 mg/d for 10 days. Patients were in-
structed to have regular intercourse every 2 to 3 days and were
monitored weekly by urinary human chorionic gonadotropin
tests and serum progesterone levels to document pregnancy
and ovulation. All treatments were stopped upon a positive
pregnancy test. If the patient did not conceive, all measure-
ments were repeated after the last treatment on the third day
of menstruation in an ovulatory cycle, or within 1 week after
the last treatment in an anovulatory cycle. Once the patient
was pregnant, treatments were stopped and the end-of-
study visit was performed within 1 week. Pregnant patients
were followed up by ultrasonography every second week un-
til fetal heart motion was visible. Pregnant women were then
referred to the obstetric unit and follow-up scans were per-
formed at weeks 18 to 24, 32, and 36 or at the discretion of the
obstetrician.21-23 Birth outcomes were obtained from obstet-
rical records.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was live birth at 20 weeks’or later
gestation during the study period.24 Prespecified secondary
outcomes included ovulation, conception, pregnancy, preg-
nancy loss, multiple (twin or triplet) pregnancies, anthropo-
metrics, hirsutism, acne, hormonal changes, quality-of-life
scores,25,26 and adverse events. Treatment credibility was
also a prespecified secondary outcome but is not reported in
thisarticle.Quality-of-lifescoresincludedthePolycysticOvary
Syndrome Health-Related Quality of Life Questionnaire (range
of 1-7, with higher scores indicating better function), Chinese
Quality of Life Instrument (range of 50-250, with higher scores
indicating better function), Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item
Short Form Health Survey (range of 0-100, with higher scores
indicating better function), Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale
(range of 25-100, with higher scores indicating worse anxi-
ety), and Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (range of 25-100,
with higher scores indicating worse depression). Serious ad-
verse events were defined as any event that was fatal or im-
mediately life threatening; led to severe or permanent disabil-
ity or required prolonged hospitalization; led to congenital
anomalies; led to pregnancy loss after 12 weeks’gestation; or
was thought to be serious by the site investigators.22,23 Explor-
atory outcomes were singleton live births, twin live births, in-
fantbirthweight,sexratio,pregnancyduration,singletonpreg-
nancy,timetoconception,pregnancylossinthefirsttrimester,
pregnancy loss in the second or third trimester, biochemical
pregnancy loss, and ectopic pregnancy.
Study Power
Without strong preliminary data on live birth after acupunc-
ture, we chose 10% as the minimal clinically detectable dif-
ference that was likely to change clinical practice. We used this
minimal clinically detectable difference of 10% in an earlier
study.4,27 Assuming a 25% live birth rate with both active in-
terventions, a 15% live birth rate with 1 active and 1 control in-
tervention, and a 5% live birth rate with both control inter-
ventions, 80% power at a significance level of .05, and a 10%
dropout rate, 1000 women would need to be enrolled.
Statistical Analysis
The study was designed to test 3 primary hypotheses compar-
ing specific combinations of interventions (Supplement 1).
However, a more standard approach to a factorial trial is to
focus on the main effects of the 2 treatments and their inter-
action. That approach was more consistent with the hypoth-
esized pattern of live birth rates used in the sample size cal-
culation and offered greater power and precision. Therefore,
although it departed from the prespecified statistical analy-
sisplan,weperformedlogisticorlinearregressionanalysisthat
included the main effects of the 2 interventions and the inter-
actionbetweenthe2interventions.Patientswhoreceivedtheir
randomized treatment (or conceived before treatment) and
completed the final visit were included in the primary analy-
sis. Study site was included as a random effect.
Categorical variables were summarized with frequencies
and percentages. Their distributions were assessed with Fisher
exact test. Continuous variables were reported as means with
standard deviations or medians with interquartile ranges. To
simplify presentation, group means using the t test were pre-
sented because the large sample size ensured the robustness
of the t test.

 There were missing data in 74 women who withdrew and
were excluded from the primary analysis. For missing data in
the secondary outcomes, we specifically reported the actual
sample size of each variable when it differed from the com-
plete sample size in each intervention group. Kaplan-Meier
curves3,4 were used to compare days from randomization to
last live birth in the 4 groups and plotted as the cumulative in-
cidence of live birth.
All analyses were conducted using SAS version 9.3 soft-
ware (SAS Institute, Inc). Two-sided P < .05 indicated statis-
tical significance.
Results
A total of 4645 women with PCOS were screened for eligibil-
ity; of them, 3645 were ineligible for various reasons and
1000 eligible women were randomized (250 in each group)
(Figure 1). Participants were recruited from July 6, 2012,
to November 18, 2014. The last live birth was recorded
on October 7, 2015. Dropouts at each stage and the number
assessed for the primary end point are presented in Figure 1.
There was no significant difference in the dropout rates
among the groups. The final visit was attended by 926
women, who composed the analytic population.
The baseline characteristics of the participants are shown
inTable1.Themean(SD)agewas27.9(3.3)years,andthemean
(SD) BMI was 24.2 (4.3). In total, 176 of 998 participants (17.7%)
were obese and 196 of 999 (19.6%) met metabolic syndrome
criteria. Patients had high adherence to treatment, including
849 of 926 participants (91.7%) for clomiphene and placebo
and 895 of 926 (96.7%) for active or control acupuncture.
Primary Outcome
There were 69 live births (29.4%) in 235 patients receiving
active acupuncture plus clomiphene, 66 (28.0%) in 236
patients with control acupuncture plus clomiphene, 31
(13.9%) in 223 patients with active acupuncture plus placebo,
and 39 (16.8%) in 232 patients with control acupuncture plus
placebo (Figure 2). There was no significant interaction on
live births between clomiphene and active acupuncture
(P = .39); therefore, the main effects of clomiphene and acu-
puncture were examined. The live birth rate was significantly
higher in the group of women treated with clomiphene than
among those who received placebo (135 of 471 [28.7%] vs 70
of 455 [15.4%]; difference, 13.3%; 95% CI, 8.0% to 18.5%) but
was not significantly different between the groups treated
with active and control acupuncture (100 of 458 [21.8%] vs
105 of 468 [22.4%]; difference, −0.6%; 95% CI, −5.9% to
4.7%) (Table 2).
Secondary Outcomes
For the secondary outcomes, the interaction between the
2 interventions was not statistically significant except for the
adverse event of back pain. Statistically significant results are
discussed herein.
The rates of ovulation, conception, pregnancy, and mul-
tiple pregnancy were significantly different between patients
treated with clomiphene vs placebo but not significantly dif-
ferent between those receiving active vs control acupunc-
ture. Differences in the effects of clomiphene vs placebo
(Table 2) were 32.1% (95% CI, 28.9% to 35.4%) in ovulation
rate per cycle (1030 of 1561 [66.0%] vs 569 of 1681 [33.8%]),
23.3% (95% CI, 18.5% to 28.1%) in ovulation rate per woman
(439 of 471 [93.2%] vs 318 of 455 [69.9%]), 22.1% (95% CI,
16.2% to 28.1%) in conception rate (214 of 471 [45.4%] vs 106
of 455 [23.3%]), and 14.3% (95% CI, 8.9% to 19.7%) in preg-
nancy rate (144 of 471 [30.6%] vs 74 of 455 [16.3%]).
The frequency of serious adverse events was very low
and did not differ significantly among the groups (Table 3).
There were 72 serious adverse events reported. Abnormal
vaginal bleeding was less common in patients receiving clo-
miphene vs placebo (10 of 500 [2.0%] vs 47 of 500 [9.4%];
difference, −7.4%; 95% CI, −10.2% to −4.6%), but dysmenor-
rhea was more common in patients receiving clomiphene vs
placebo (13 of 500 [2.6%] vs 3 of 500 [0.6%]; difference,
2.0%; 95% CI, 0.4% to 3.6%). Patients receiving active acu-
puncture compared with those receiving control acupunc-
ture more commonly had bruising (37 of 500 [7.4%] vs 9 of
500 [1.8%]; difference, 5.6%; 95% CI, 3.0% to 8.2%) and diar-
rhea (25 of 500 [5.0%] vs 8 of 500 [1.6%]; difference, 3.4%;
95% CI, 1.2% to 5.6%).
During pregnancy, back pain was reported less fre-
quently in patients receiving active acupuncture plus clomi-
phene than in those receiving control acupuncture plus clo-
miphene in the first trimester (1 of 108 [0.9%] vs 8 of 106
[7.5%]; difference, −6.6%; 95% CI, −12.0% to −1.3%) and less
frequently in patients receiving active acupuncture plus pla-
cebo than in those receiving control acupuncture plus pla-
cebo in the second and third trimesters (2 of 51 [3.9%] vs 10
of 55 [18.2%]; difference, −14.3%; 95% CI, −25.8% to −2.8%).
Clomiphene was more frequently associated with back pain
in patients receiving active acupuncture plus clomiphene
than in those receiving active acupuncture plus placebo in
the second and third trimesters (22 of 108 [20.4%] vs 2 of 51
[3.9%]; difference, 16.4%; 95% CI, 7.2% to 25.7%). The most
common adverse events were gestational diabetes mellitus
and preterm labor. Two congenital anomalies were reported.
Four newborn deaths were reported from 2 preterm twin
deliveries in the group that received control acupuncture
plus placebo.
Significantly greater increases in circulating levels
of progesterone, total testosterone, estradiol, and sex
hormone–binding globulin were found in women receiving
clomiphene vs placebo, and these levels were not signifi-
cantly different between women receiving active vs control
acupuncture. The hormone results are presented in eTable 3
in Supplement 2.
There were no significant changes in quality of life among
the 4 groups (eTable 4 in Supplement 2).
Exploratory Outcomes
For the exploratory outcomes, the interaction between the 2
interventions was not statistically significant except for dura-
tion of pregnancy. Clomiphene was associated with higher
rates of conception, single and twin pregnancies, and single

a Live birth was defined as the delivery of a live-born infant (�20 weeks’gestation). Conception was defined as
any positive serum level of human chorionic gonadotropin. Pregnancy was defined as an intrauterine pregnancy
with fetal heart motion, as determined by ultrasonography. There were no triple or higher-order pregnancies
except twin pregnancies in this trial. Ovulation was defined as a serum progesterone level according to the
standard of the local site laboratory (minimum value of luteal phase).

 Discussion
This trial found that clomiphene was superior to placebo for
achieving live births among infertile women with PCOS and
that active acupuncture provided no additional benefit over
control acupuncture. Secondary outcomes of ovulation and
pregnancy were more likely to occur after treatment with
clomiphene than with placebo, but not with active acupunc-
ture vs control acupuncture. These findings do not support
acupuncture alone or combined with clomiphene as an
infertility treatment in patients with PCOS.
A Cochrane review6 found insufficient evidence for
active acupuncture compared with control acupuncture to
treat anovulation and infertility in women with PCOS. Before
this study, 2 trials demonstrated that acupuncture was effec-
tive for ovulation induction compared with no treatment or
regularly meeting with a therapist.13,14 The only sham-
controlled trial using a nonpenetrating sham was underpow-
ered for investigating live births,8 but it found ovulation rates
between active and control acupuncture similar to those
observed in this study. That study used the nonpenetrating
Streitberger placebo needle,28 whereas superficial needle
placement was used as a control in this study. Both control
situations involved fewer needles and placement away from
the active acupuncture needle placement sites.
The appropriate control group in acupuncture trials is
debated because the nonpenetrating and superficial acu-
puncture needle techniques are not completely inert.29
The ovulation rates in the active and control acupuncture
groups in this trial were higher than rates in trials with a
no-intervention control group.13,14 Thus, the acupuncture
procedure, unrelated to needle placement or stimulation,
may have placebo effects.
There was no statistically significant difference between
active and control acupuncture in clinical or biochemical
variables or serious adverse events. There were 2 congenital
anomalies. The incidence was similar to recent trials evaluat-
ing the effectiveness of clomiphene, metformin, letrozole, or
berberine for live births in women with PCOS.3,4,24 Although
4 neonatal deaths occurred, these were in the group receiv-
ing control treatments and were due to the loss of 2 preterm
twin pregnancies. Patients receiving active acupuncture had
a higher incidence of skin bruising and diarrhea compared
with control acupuncture. However, back pain during preg-
nancy was less frequent in the active acupuncture groups.
Clomiphene is the first-line choice for ovulation induc-
tion for anovulatory infertility in PCOS.5 The ovulation rate
per cycle with clomiphene seems not to be affected by eth-
nicity or race, although obesity has a negative effect. In previ-
ous studies, ovulation rates have been 49.0% in obese white
women,4 56.2% in lean or overweight Indian women,30 and
59.0% in obese Malaysian women,31 compared with 66.0% in
the Chinese women with a mean BMI of 24.2 in this study.
Pregnancy loss in the control acupuncture and clomi-
phene group was 34.9%. The pregnancy loss was higher than
in other large multicenter trials in women with PCOS, ie, 25.8%
in the PPCOS I study3 and 29.1% in the PPCOS II study.4,32,33
Thereasonmaybeincreaseddetectionofearlyconceptionwith
subsequent biochemical pregnancies or early pregnancy loss
in this trial.
Strengths of this study include the factorial design, ad-
equatepower,similarwithdrawalratesamonggroups,andhigh
adherence to treatment.
This study had several limitations. One limitation was
the fixed acupuncture protocol. Personalized acupuncture
treatment might have been more effective. In traditional
Chinese medicine, acupuncture is often combined with indi-
vidualized herbal mixtures, which were prohibited in the
protocol to avoid confounding. Another limitation is the
deviation of the statistical approach with factorial analysis
from the serial 2-way comparisons that were prespecified in
the protocol.
Conclusions
Among Chinese women with PCOS, the use of acupuncture
with or without clomiphene, compared with control acu-
puncture and placebo, did not increase live births. This find-
ing does not support acupuncture as an infertility treatment
in such women.
