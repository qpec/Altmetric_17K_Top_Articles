Impact of total knee replacement practice: cost effectiveness 
analysis of data from the Osteoarthritis Initiative

ABSTRACT
ObjeCtives
To evaluate the impact of total knee replacement on 
quality of life in people with knee osteoarthritis and to 
estimate associated differences in lifetime costs and 
quality adjusted life years (QALYs) according to use by 
level of symptoms.
Design
Marginal structural modeling and cost effectiveness 
analysis based on lifetime predictions for total knee 
replacement and death from population based cohort 
data.
setting
Data from two studies—Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) 
and the Multicenter Osteoarthritis Study (MOST)—
within the US health system.
PartiCiPants
4498 participants with or at high risk for knee 
osteoarthritis aged 45-79 from the OAI with no 
previous knee replacement (confirmed by baseline 
radiography) followed up for nine years. Validation 
cohort comprised 2907 patients from MOST with two 
year follow-up.
interventiOn
Scenarios ranging from current practice, defined as 
total knee replacement practice as performed in the 
OAI (with procedural rates estimated by a prediction 
model), to practice limited to patients with severe 
symptoms to no surgery.
Main OutCOMe Measures
Generic (SF-12) and osteoarthritis specific quality of 
life measured over 96 months, model based QALYs, 
costs, and incremental cost effectiveness ratios over a 
lifetime horizon.
results
In the OAI, total knee replacement showed 
improvements in quality of life with small absolute 
changes when averaged across levels of confounding 
variables: 1.70 (95% uncertainty interval 0.26 to 3.57) 
for SF-12 physical component summary (PCS); −10.69 
(−13.39 to −8.01) for Western Ontario and McMaster 
Universities arthritis index (WOMAC); and 9.16 (6.35 to 
12.49) for knee injury and osteoarthritis outcome score 
(KOOS) quality of life subscale. These improvements 
became larger with decreasing functional status at 
baseline. Provision of total knee replacement to 
patients with SF-12 PCS scores <35 was the optimal 
scenario given a cost effectiveness threshold of 
$200 000/QALY, with cost savings of $6974 ($5789 to 
$8269) and a minimal loss of 0.008 (−0.056 to 0.043) 
QALYs compared with current practice. These findings 
were reproduced among patients with knee 
osteoarthritis from the MOST cohort and were robust 
against various scenarios including increased rates of 
total knee replacement and mortality and inclusion of 
non-healthcare costs but were sensitive to increased 
deterioration in quality of life without surgery. In a 
threshold analysis, total knee replacement would 
become cost effective in patients with SF-12 PCS scores 
≤40 if the associated hospital admission costs fell 
below $14 000 given a cost effectiveness threshold of 
$200 000/QALY.
COnClusiOn
Current practice of total knee replacement as 
performed in a recent US cohort of patients with knee 
osteoarthritis had minimal effects on quality of life and 
QALYs at the group level. If the procedure were 
restricted to more severely affected patients, its 
effectiveness would rise, with practice becoming 
economically more attractive than its current use.
Introduction
Osteoarthritis is a leading cause of disability world-
wide,1  resulting in pain, structural changes in the bone 
and joint space, and limitation of motion. Disease onset 
is gradual and usually begins after the age of 40. Osteo-
arthritis of the knee has a variable prognosis. Once 
present, improvement of joint structure is rare when 
assessed by radiography, but abatement of joint pain 
and disability occurs frequently.2  About 12% of adults 
in the US are affected.3  The annual rate of total knee 
replacement in the US has doubled since 2000, espe-
cially in those aged 45-64.4 5  This disproportionate 
increase in this practice has been attributed to expan-
sion of eligibility to people with less severe symptoms.6 
 
The total number of procedures performed each year 
now exceeds 640 000, at a total annual cost of about 
$10.2bn (£8.3bn, €9.6bn).5
WhAT IS AlReAdy knoWn on ThIS TopIC
Rates of total knee replacement in the US have more than doubled since 2000, 
primarily because of expanding eligibility to patients with less symptomatic knee 
osteoarthritis
Up to a third of recipients of total knee replacement experience chronic pain 
postoperatively, and health benefits are assumed to be higher in those with poor 
preoperative physical functioning
WhAT ThIS STudy AddS
Quality of life outcomes generally improve after total knee replacement, with small 
effects becoming larger with decreasing preoperative functional status
The practice of total knee replacement as performed in a recent US cohort of 
patients with knee osteoarthritis had minimal effects on QALYs at the group level 
and was found to be economically unattractive
Total knee replacement practice, however, could be considered cost effective if the 
procedure were restricted to patients with more severely affected functional status

The potential benefit of total knee replacement in 
patients with knee osteoarthritis should outweigh the 
associated costs. A recent randomized controlled trial 
looked at replacement compared with non-surgical 
management alone in 95 patients and showed large 
improvements in pain and physical limitations and sig-
nificant increases in quality of life at 12 months.7  The 
trial population predominantly included patients with 
severe preoperative symptoms, as shown by low mean 
quality of life utility values at baseline.7  Many previ-
ously published uncontrolled before-after studies 
showed similarly large effects.8 
9  In particular, the sys-
tematic review by Shan and colleagues described 19 
studies that showed substantial improvements from 
baseline status, both in the intermediate and long term, 
for disease specific and generic health related quality of 
life across a broad range of domains.9  It is estimated, 
however, that up to a third of recipients of total knee 
replacement experience chronic pain postopera-
tively,10 11  and the health benefits of the procedure are 
assumed to be higher in those with poor physical func-
tioning before surgery.12-14  This would imply that 
patients undergoing the procedure because of the 
recently expanded practice in the US might show less 
significant improvement in symptoms. Yet, the effec-
tiveness of total knee replacement has been understud-
ied in patients who are representative for the current 
practice population.10 
11
We used data from the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) 
to estimate the effect of total knee replacement accord-
ing to patients’ functional status by looking at longitu-
dinal health outcomes of patients with knee 
osteoarthritis with heterogeneous symptoms who 
underwent the procedure compared with those who did 
not.15 We subsequently performed a decision modeling 
study to evaluate the impact of the procedure on life-
time costs and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) while 
varying its use by level of symptoms.
Methods
study populations
We obtained the data for our analysis from the Osteoar-
thritis Initiative (OAI) database, which is available for 
public access at http://www.oai.ucsf.edu/. The OAI is a 
multi-center cohort study of 4796 individuals with knee 
osteoarthritis or at risk for knee osteoarthritis who were 
recruited from the general population in 2005-06 across 
four US centers. Study participants were aged 45-79 at 
enrolment and were tracked with repeated follow-up 
evaluations for nine years. These evaluations included 
physical examinations, radiographs of both knees, and 
questionnaires on risk factors, symptoms, medical his-
tory, and quality of life. Knee osteoarthritis was defined 
as the patient having pain, aching, or stiffness in or 
around the knee on most days for at least one month 
during the past 12 months, and radiographically con-
firmed tibiofemoral osteophytes of grades 1-3 according 
to the Osteoarthritis Research Society International 
(OARSI) atlas.16 
17  Patients eligible for the current analy-
sis were those included in the outcomes dataset released 
11 October 2015 (n=4796). To develop a  
decision model 
for estimating lifetime outcomes, we excluded partici-
pants who had already undergone TKR at baseline, con-
firmed by radiography (n=62) and participants from the 
low osteoarthritis risk, “non-exposed” control group 
(n=122) who had no established risk factors, symptoms 
or radiographic findings of knee osteoarthritis.18  This 
resulted in a development sample of 4498 (table 1). OAI 
participants classified as having knee osteoarthritis at 
baseline (n=1327), as opposed to participants who were 
at high risk for knee osteoarthritis, were defined as the 
study population for estimation of the effect of total 
knee replacement on quality of life and use of non-sur-
gical treatment for osteoarthritis pain, and for the base 
case cost effectiveness analysis. To validate the effect 
estimates, we repeated similar analyses with 30 months’ 
follow-up data on 965 participants with knee osteoar-
thritis at baseline of the Multicenter Osteoarthritis Study 
(MOST).23 To show generalizability of the base case cost 
effectiveness analysis, we performed a scenario analysis 
using the 965 MOST patients.
Modeling effect of total knee replacement on quality 
of life and use of non-surgical treatment
Outcomes were defined as the SF-12 physical compo-
nent summary (PCS) score, the SF-12 mental component 
summary (MCS) score, the SF-6D utility index, the West-
ern Ontario and McMaster Universities arthritis index 
(WOMAC), the quality of life subscale on the knee injury 
and osteoarthritis outcome score (KOOS), and self 
reported use of pain medication for osteoarthritis, all 
measured at 12, 24, 36, 48, 72, and 96 months. We eval-
uated the effect of total knee replacement on use of 
non-pharmacological treatments with measurements at 
24, 48, and 96 months, as questions on these treatments 
were not included at the other study visits. The SF-12 
instrument is a single page questionnaire measuring 
generic quality of life.24  To estimate this, we calculated 
the SF-6D utility index, which can be directly derived 
from SF-12 by using a previously published algorithm.25 
 
The KOOS and WOMAC instruments are validated ques-
tionnaires measuring quality of life, pain, stiffness, and 
functionality specific for osteoarthritis.24 
26 
27 We chose 
to use only the KOOS quality of life subscale, which 
measures knee related quality of life and mental and 
social aspects such as awareness and lifestyle changes. 
These items are not well captured by the WOMAC total 
score, which focuses on knee symptoms and function-
ing. The Pearson product moment correlation coeffi-
cient for the two scores in the 1327 OAI participants with 
knee osteoarthritis was −0.67
. Osteoarthritis pain medi-
cation included acetaminophen (paracetamol), 
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and 
cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors. Non-pharmaco-
logical treatments included massage, chiropractic, acu-
puncture treatments, and other less commonly used 
complementary treatment options such as acupressure, 
chelation therapy, folk medicine, and homeopathic 
treatment.
To estimate the effect of total knee replacement on 
these longitudinally measured outcomes compared 
with no/delayed procedure, we used marginal

structural models for repeated measures defined as 
weighted generalized estimating equations (GEEs) 
with each outcome as the dependent variable.28  Mar-
ginal structural models are warranted when outcome 
values can vary over time and can predict future treat-
ment assignment along with other time varying con-
founders. For example, an increase in use of 
osteoarthritis pain medication could be associated 
with a higher likelihood of receiving total knee replace-
ment. Each GEE included a treatment variable for the 
procedure, which was set to one after performance, a 
study visit indicator, the outcome’s baseline value, and 
other baseline variables including age, sex, race, 
income, education, knee injury in medical history, 
knee surgery in medical history, body mass index 
(BMI), Charlson comorbidity score,29  use of osteoar-
thritis pain medication, doctor’s diagnosis of knee 
osteoarthritis, Kellgren-Lawrence radiographic grade, 
SF-12 scores, WOMAC total score, and KOOS quality of 
life. To evaluate the effectiveness of total knee replace-
ment according to preoperative physical functioning, 
we included an interaction term for the procedure with 
baseline SF-12 PCS.30 31  Within these GEEs, we included 
weights for treatment propensity (that is, the likeli-
hood of having received total knee replacement) for 
each study visit. Weights were estimated by logistic 
regression models pooled for study visits with the 
above mentioned baseline variables, study visit, longi-
tudinally measured BMI, Charlson comorbidity score, 
doctor’s diagnosis of knee osteoarthritis, Kellgren-Law-
rence radiographic grade, and all outcome variables. 
The main treatment effect estimate obtained from the 
marginal structural modeling should be interpreted as 
a “time averaged” causal effect.28
Missing values were imputed 20 times with a flexible 
additive model including status variables and the 
 
Nelson-Aalen estimator of the cumulative hazard for 
total knee replacement and death. To estimate parame-
ter uncertainty, we re-fitted imputation, pooled logistic 
regression, and GEE models in 500 bootstrap datasets. 
We used the 2.5th and 97
.5th centiles of bootstrap effect 
estimates for uncertainty interval limits. To validate the 
effect estimates from models developed with OAI 
patients, we performed multivariable adjusted analyses 
for SF-12 scores, SF-6D utility index, WOMAC, and use of 
osteoarthritis pain medication using 30 months’ fol-
low-up data on 965 MOST participants with knee osteo-
arthritis at baseline. All statistical analyses were 
performed with R version 3.2.0 (2015, R Foundation for 
Statistical Computing). For more information on these 
statistical analyses see appendix 1.
Modeling of lifetime outcomes and cost 
effectiveness of total knee replacement
We developed the KOSMOS (Knee OSteoarthritis MicrO-
Simulation) model to simulate the virtual life course of 
1327 OAI patients by modeling the occurrence of pri-
mary total knee replacement, revision procedure, and 
death up to age 100. Rates of primary total knee replace-
ment and death were modeled by cause specific multi-
variable Cox regression with chronological age as time 
scale. Revision rates were based on the literature19 
using the log cumulative hazard of revision procedure 
as reported for different age groups, which was mod-
eled as a linear function of log time since the primary 
procedure. Health related SF-6D utility scores, use of 
osteoarthritis pain medication, and use of non-pharma-
cological treatment were based on the patients’ base-
line and predicted 96 month values taken from the 
output of the GEEs with and without total knee replace-
ment. We used linear interpolation to calculate patients’ 
values through eight years. We estimated SF-12 PCS,

SF-12 MCS, and SF-6D scores for patients alive longer 
than eight years by linear extrapolation, based on the 
observed steady changes over time (figs A-C in 
 
appendix 3). Use of osteoarthritis pain medication and 
 
non-pharmacological treatments was assumed to 
remain stable after eight years (figs F and G in appendix 
3), and the predicted 96 month probability of use was 
carried forward.
For simulated patients who survived each cycle of the 
model, we calculated an undiscounted QALY as the pre-
dicted SF-6D score multiplied by one year, thus result-
ing in a different QALY outcome for patients receiving 
total knee replacement in that cycle. Patients could 
accrue QALYs in the model until death or age 100. We 
calculated effect modification of procedure by SF-12 PCS 
scores using the latest predicted score, which was 
updated every eighth year until total knee replacement. 
We assumed that with revision procedure a beneficial 
effect on SF-12 PCS, use of osteoarthritis pain medica-
tion, and non-pharmacological treatment would be 
cancelled out by deterioration and improvement before 
and after the revision.32 
33
Costs associated with care of knee osteoarthritis and 
total knee replacement procedures were estimated from 
a US health system perspective (table 2 ) and were either 
applied for each model cycle (annual costs associated 
with pharmacological and non-pharmacological treat-
ment, physician office visits, and imaging) or as a one 
off cost penalty (costs associated with primary and revi-
sion procedures and rehabilitation including physio-
therapy). All costs were expressed in 2013 $, with 
inflation rates reported in the US healthcare consumer 
price index.34 We recalibrated the average life expec-
tancy predicted by the KOSMOS model for the modeled 
patient cohort to reflect the average life expectancy as 
predicted by age and sex specific US 2011 life tables and 
validated the KOSMOS model’s predictive performance 
in OAI and MOST data. More details on the development 
and validity of the KOSMOS model are provided in 
appendix 1.
For the base case analysis, we modeled 10 scenarios, 
ranging from current practice with rates as observed in 
the OAI, to lower rates of practice in which the proce-
dure was performed only in individuals with lower SF-12 
PCS levels (from <55-<20), to a scenario without total 
knee replacement. In the restricted scenarios, the 
underlying annual rate was kept the same as modeled 
for the current practice scenario, but no effects on qual-
ity of life, use of non-surgical treatment, and costs, and 
no procedural mortality rates were incorporated if the 
preceding SF-12 PCS level was greater than or equal to 
the threshold value.
For each scenario, we performed microsimulation of 
1327 individuals for each set of 500 bootstrap equations 
and calculated the accrued QALYs and costs using the 
recommended 3% discount rate.35  We calculated 95% 
uncertainty intervals by using the 2.5th and 97
.5th cen-
tiles of 500 modeled outcomes, each averaged across 
1327 individuals. We calculated incremental cost effec-
tiveness ratios (ICERs), defined as the difference in aver-
age costs divided by the difference in average QALYs, 
after ranking scenarios according to increasing costs 
and exclusion of dominated scenarios. Dominated sce-
narios were defined as programs less effective and more 
costly than the previous program (absolutely 
 
dominated) and programs with a larger incremental 
cost effectiveness ratio than the next not dominated 
program (extendedly dominated). We considered cost 
effectiveness thresholds of $50 000, $100 000, and 
$200 000 per QALY for decision making.36
sensitivity analyses
In threshold analyses, we varied the hospital admission 
costs of primary and revision total knee replacement 
and used various percentages up to 100% for a further 
decline in quality of life (SF-12 PCS, SF-12 MCS, and 
SF-6D) in patients who were simulated to receive the 
procedure in the current practice scenario but were 
modeled to not receive the procedure in the other sce-
narios. For modeling the additional decline, we multi-
plied the main effect of follow-up time by values from 1 
to 2. We used a time lag of four years after total knee 
replacement (equal to the difference in last follow-up 
measurement and median time to the procedure), so 
that the further decrease would reflect a long term effect 
of total knee replacement that we could have missed 
using OAI data.
We performed a scenario analysis using the 965 
MOST patients after recalibration of hazard rates for 
total knee replacement and an analysis using EuroQol 
(EQ)-5d utility values as a substitute for SF-6D values by 
conversion of SF-12 MCS and PCS scores by a published 
equation.37-39  In additional analyses, we modeled an 
increased rate of primary total knee replacement up to 
30% to investigate the impact of a further increase in 
procedure rates as observed in the US after 2006.5  We 
also increased the background mortality rate based on 
findings that patients with osteoarthritis might have an 
excess all cause mortality compared with the general 
population by multiplying mortality rates by standard-
ized mortality ratios sampled from a lognormal distri-
bution (mean 1.55, 95% confidence interval 1.41 to 
1.70).40  Finally, we performed an analysis exploring the 
potential influence of non-healthcare costs and loss of 
productivity not captured by a decrease in health util-
ity,41 through inclusion of costs due to work time lost by 
patients and cost of informal caregiving. More details 
on these sensitivity analyses are provided in appendix 1.
Patient involvement
No patients were involved in developing plans for 
recruitment, design, or implementation of the studies, 
nor were they involved in developing the research ques-
tions and outcome measures. No patients were asked to 
advice on interpretation or writing up of results. Plans 
are in place for dissemination of the results of the 
research to the patient community. These plans include 
providing manuscript summaries to media sources, 
osteoarthritis charities, provider bodies, and patient 
organizations, in addition to social media announce-
ments and institutional provision of pamphlets in 
health system waiting areas.

Results
study populations
The 1327 OAI participants with knee osteoarthritis at 
baseline had worse SF-12 PCS, SF-6D, and osteoarthritis 
specific quality of life scores than the 3171 at high risk 
for knee osteoarthritis (P<0.001, table 1). There were 382 
total knee replacements, of which 319 were done before 
the 96 month visit, and 255 were in the 1327 with knee 
osteoarthritis at baseline. In the MOST cohort (table A, 
appendix 2), 135 total knee replacements were per-
formed in 965 participants with knee osteoarthritis at 
baseline, and 16 were performed in 1719 individuals at 
high risk of knee osteoarthritis, all before the 30 month 
visit.
effect of total knee replacement on quality of life 
and use of non-surgical treatment
Figures A-G in appendix 3 show time trends of SF-12 
PCS, SF-12 MCS, SF-6D, WOMAC, KOOS quality of life, 
use of osteoarthritis pain medication, and non-pharma-
cological treatments, specified for those who did and 
did not undergo total knee replacement. After adjust-
ment for baseline and time varying confounders, the 
main effects of total knee replacement (that is, treat-
ment effects averaged across confounding variable lev-
els and follow-up time) comprised an absolute 
improvement of 1.70 points (95% uncertainty interval 
0.26 to 3.57) on SF-12 PCS, and changes in SF-12 MCS of 
−0.22 (−1.49 to 1.31) and SF-6D of 0.008 (−0.008 to 0.028) 
point. For each unit decrease in baseline SF-12 PCS, the 
effect on SF-6D increased and could be calculated as 
0.098−0.002×(SF-12 PCS), suggesting that total knee 
replacement would become more effective if it was 
restricted to patients with SF-12 PCS scores <50. For 
osteoarthritis specific measures of quality of life, the 
procedure’s main effects included improvement of the 
WOMAC score by 10.69 (8.01 to 13.39) and KOOS quality 
of life of 9.16 (6.35 to 12.49) points. Total knee replace-
ment reduced the odds of use of medication for osteoar-
thritis pain, but this effect was uncertain, with an odds 
ratio of 0.81 (0.55 to 1.12). Use of non-pharmacological 
treatment did not significantly seem to change with 
total knee replacement (0.91, 0.55 to 1.77). These effects 
were generally consistent with those obtained from 
multivariable adjusted analyses of MOST data, although 
in MOST the effect on SF-12 MCS was positive in contrast 
with the effect in OAI (table 3).
lifetime outcomes and cost effectiveness of total 
knee replacement practice
In the current practice scenario, the lifetime likelihood 
of undergoing total knee replacement, as predicted for 
OAI, was 39.9% (95% uncertainty interval 34.5 to 45.3), 
and the average undiscounted life expectancy was 22.39 
years (21.13 to 23.85 years). Modeled quality of life val-
ues and proportions of use of non-surgical treatments 
over time were generally most favorable in the current 
practice scenario, except for SF-12 MCS scores (figs I-M, 
appendix 3). The mean discounted QALYs in the current 
practice scenario were 11.18 (10.66 to 11.70) and costs 
were $17 168 ($15 307 to $19 124).

In the base case cost effectiveness analysis, only the 
ICER of total knee replacement for those with SF-12 PCS 
<20 fell below $100 000/QALY. The optimal scenario 
given a cost effectiveness threshold of $200 000/QALY 
was surgery for those with SF-12 PCS scores <35; surgery 
for those with SF-12 PCS <40 was borderline cost effec-
tive. Compared with current practice, restriction of sur-
gery to those with SF-12 PCS <35 would decrease the 
lifetime likelihood of total knee replacement to 10.2% 
(95% uncertainty 8.1 to 12.4), and would save $6974 
($5789 to $8269) per patient, whereas the effectiveness 
would be only slightly lower at −0.008 (−0.056 to 0.043) 
QALYs. The ICER of this strategy compared with the pre-
vious best scenario was $160 974/QALY (table 4  and fig 
1). The current practice scenario was less effective and 
more expensive than the more restrictive scenarios with 
SF-12 PCS threshold values of 40-55 and therefore dom-
inated. None of the ICERs fell below the $50 000/QALY 
threshold. The likelihood that the current practice sce-
nario would be considered to be cost effective was low 
for cost effectiveness thresholds below $200 000/QALY 
(fig N, appendix 3).
sensitivity analyses
With a cost effectiveness threshold of $200 000/QALY, 
restriction of surgery to those with SF-12 PCS <40 
became attractive if the hospital admission costs of pri-
mary total knee replacement fell below $14 000. If the 
admission costs of primary total knee replacement fell 
below $8000, restriction of surgery to those with SF-12 
PCS <30 would become economically attractive given a 
cost effectiveness threshold of $100 000/QALY. Cost 
effectiveness outcomes were not sensitive to the admis-
sion costs of revision procedures.
Simulation of the MOST population with knee osteo-
arthritis provided much higher lifetime likelihoods of 
total knee replacement, but similar ICERs, although 
restriction of surgery to those with SF-12 PCS <40 now 
became the optimal scenario at a cost effectiveness 
threshold of $200 000/QALY (table E in appendix 2). 
Use of EQ-5D utility values improved ICERs, with the 
ICER of restriction of surgery to those with SF-12 PCS 
<40 now amply falling below $200 000/QALY (table F in 
appendix 2). Increasing rates of primary total knee 
replacement or background mortality only minimally 
affected incremental cost effectiveness outcomes, and 
restriction of surgery to those with SF-12 PCS <35 
remained the optimal scenario at a cost effectiveness 
threshold of $200 000/QALY (tables G and H in 
 
appendix 2).
Inclusion of costs associated with work days lost (see 
table D in appendix 2) and informal caregiving did not 
have a major impact on the cost effectiveness results: 
again restriction of surgery to those with SF-12 PCS <35 
was the optimal scenario at a cost effectiveness thresh-
old of $200 000/QALY (table I in appendix 2). If patients 
who would receive total knee replacement in current 
practice, but not in the more restrictive scenarios, expe-
rienced an additional decline of 50% in quality of life 
over the long term, all scenarios of performing total 
knee replacement including current practice became

discussion
Principal findings
We evaluated the effectiveness of total knee replace-
ment on quality of life and use of non-surgical treat-
ment in a recent US cohort of patients with knee 
osteoarthritis. Compared with patients who did not 
undergo total knee replacement, generic quality of life 
scores (on SF-12 physical) and those related to osteoar-
thritis improved with performance of the procedure, 
with larger improvements generally in those with a 
lower SF-12 physical score at baseline. Changes in use of 
osteoarthritis pain medication and SF-12 mental scores 
were small and heterogeneous across the two cohorts. 
In a cost effectiveness analysis modeling the life courses 
of OAI patients with knee osteoarthritis with inclusion 
of utility values derived from the SF-12, current practice 
was more expensive and in some cases even less effec-
tive compared with scenarios in which total knee 
replacement was performed only in patients with lower 
physical functioning. At the group level, the economi-
cally most attractive strategy was performing the proce-
dure in those with a SF-12 PCS <35, assuming a cost 
effectiveness threshold of $200 000 per QALY. These 
findings were reproduced among knee osteoarthritis 
patients from the MOST cohort. Extension of the use of 
total knee replacement to those with a SF-12 physical 
score of ≤40 would become financially attractive if the 
hospital admission costs fell below $14 000.
Comparison with other studies
Scenarios of total knee replacement restricted to those 
with lower SF-12 PCS scores provided higher QALYs in 
our cost effectiveness analysis because small improve-
ments in quality of life after the procedure became more 
prominent in people with lower baseline scores. A 
recently published randomized controlled trial showed 
larger effects of total knee replacement on quality of life 
measures than we found. 7  The OAI patient population 
undergoing total knee replacement, however, had on 
average less severe symptoms before surgery compared 
with the population from that randomized controlled 
trial, and the mean follow-up duration was longer in the 
OAI. Moreover, measures of quality of life were assessed 
independently of care providers in the OAI, contribut-
ing to a more limited potential for reporting desirable 
answers on quality of life scores before and after 
 
surgery.42 43  Recent uncontrolled before-after studies 
have also shown larger effects of total knee replace-
ment, generally including improvements in SF-12 PCS 
scores of 5-15 points.32 
44-53  In these studies, changes in 
SF-12 MCS were heterogeneous and varied from no 
improvement to 5 points.47 
49  Similar to SF-12 PCS, larger 
effects have been shown in before-after studies for qual-
ity of life measures specific to osteoarthritis.13

55 As 
with the study population in the randomized controlled 
trial, however, the preoperative quality of life scores for 
these studies were on average worse than those of our 
study population and the duration of follow-up was 
generally shorter, possibly explaining the larger effects.
In addition to our analysis, three observational stud-
ies have compared quality of life outcomes in patients 
who did and did not undergo total knee replace-
ment.12 56 57  Two of these studies were not designed to 
prospectively collect data on generic and osteoarthritis 
related quality of life measures in people who did not 
and did undergo the procedure.12 
56  In a single hospital 
prospective cohort study (n=174) including 30 patients 
who received total knee replacement, there were large 
improvements in SF-12 PCS (9.6 points) and total 
WOMAC (24.2 points) scores at 12 months after joint 
replacement. The effect estimation, however, included 
effects of hip replacements (n=21), which generally 
have much larger effects than knee replacements.47 49 
 
Modeling studies that investigated the cost effective-
ness of total knee replacement all used effects from 
before-after studies with larger marginal effects on 
quality of life, contributing to much lower estimated 
ICERs than we found.13

strengths and limitations of study
We estimated the effectiveness of total knee replace-
ment versus no or delayed surgery in a large popula-
tion based sample, the OAI cohort study, adjusting for 
baseline and time varying variables using marginal 
structural models. Marginal structural modeling has 
been shown to produce unbiased estimates of causal 
treatment effects.28  The larger number of procedures 
in our analysis enabled us to evaluate effect modifica-
tion by baseline symptoms. Effect estimates and mod-
ification by baseline physical functional scores 
obtained in OAI were generally consistent with those 
found in the MOST population. Nevertheless, our find-
ings should be interpreted in light of several limita-

tions. First, the knee osteoarthritis populations of the 
OAI and MOST might not be representative of the cur-
rent total population of patients with knee osteoarthri-
tis in the US, limiting the generalizability of our 
findings. For example, younger patients might have 
been under-represented, contributing to fewer lower 
quality of life values from symptoms affecting work 
and other regular activities. Yet, both studies recruited 
participants from the general population across differ-
ent regions in the US and obtained detailed informa-
tion on risk factors, total knee replacements, and 
outcome measures independently from the hospital in 
which procedures were performed. Furthermore, our 
conclusions were unaffected by an increase in the rate 
of total knee replacement, resembling the most recent 
increase in use on a national level. Second, the study 
visits performed within OAI and MOST did not allow 
for measurement of outcomes immediately before pro-
cedures, and ignoring worsening symptoms just 
before could cause an underestimation of the true 
effect. We, however, adjusted for differences in 12 
month changes in use of osteoarthritis pain medica-
tion, Kellgren-Lawrence radiographic grade, and qual-
ity of life scores assessed at the visit preceding total 
knee replacement. In addition, no changes in quality 
of life are observed at 12 months before procedures 
versus at one month before,50  and an immediate wors-
ening of symptoms as a reason for undergoing total 
knee replacement is not likely as patients generally 
defer surgery for years before finally proceeding.60-62 
Third, as our study was based on analyses of non-ran-
domized data without an intention to treat principle, 
residual confounding by indication and selection bias 
could be possible. Fourth, the self reported outcomes 
available in the retrospective data, such as use of 
osteoarthritis pain medication and loss of productiv-
ity, could potentially have influenced outcomes 
because of reporting bias or non-differential overesti-
mation and underestimation. Finally, we made several 
assumptions in our cost effectiveness analysis. In any 
modeling study, a trade-off must be made between 
comprehensively including consequences of each 
strategy and their relevance to the decision problem at 
hand. We developed our decision model using individ-
ual level data on quality of life, treatment use, and 
survival, which allowed us to incorporate correlation 
between the model parameters while assessing uncer-
tainty. Unfortunately, the OAI and MOST studies did 
not include collection of cost data. We therefore had to 
estimate costs using the best available external data 
sources, which might not have been representative for 
our patient cohort.
Conclusions and policy implications
Improvements in quality of life with total knee replace-
ment were on average smaller than previously shown. 
Given its limited effectiveness in individuals with less 
severely affected physical function, performance of 
total knee replacement in these patients seems to be 
economically unjustifiable. Considerable cost savings 
could be made by limiting eligibility to patients with 
more symptomatic knee osteoarthritis. Only one ran-
domized controlled trial has so far been published 
 
evaluating total knee replacement as an adjunct treat-
ment to optimized non-surgical treatment, but it did not 
include results according to symptom status.7 Our find-
ings emphasize the need for more research comparing 
total knee replacement with less expensive, more con-
servative interventions, particularly in patients with 
less severe symptoms, and research aiming to develop 
individualized prediction models for a better selection 
of patients with a predicted large net benefit from the 
procedure. These interventions can then be compared 
within cost effectiveness analyses, for which non-US 
data sources should be considered as well. In conclu-
sion, the practice of total knee replacement as per-
formed in a recent US cohort of patients with knee 
osteoarthritis had minimal effects on quality of life. If 
the procedure were restricted to patients with more 
severe functional status, however, its effectiveness 
would rise, with practice becoming economically more 
attractive.
