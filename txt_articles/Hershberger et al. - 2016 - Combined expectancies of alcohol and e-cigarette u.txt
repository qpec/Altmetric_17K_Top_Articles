Abstract
Electronic cigarettes (e-cigs) were created to approximate the look, feel, and experience of using a 
cigarette. Since cigarette and alcohol use co-occur, we hypothesized that e-cig and alcohol use 
also co-occur, likely due to shared positive drug expectations. Using self-report data from two 
independent samples of community-dwelling alcohol using adults, the present study: (1) modified 
the Nicotine and Other Substance Interaction Expectancy Questionnaire (NOSIE) to assess 
expectancies of combined e-cig and alcohol use (i.e. the individuals perceived likelihood of using 
e-cigs and alcohol together; NOSIE-ER); and (2) examined the relationships among e-cig use, 
expectancies, and alcohol use across e-cig use status. In the first sample (N=692, mean age=32.6, 
SD = 9.74, 50.7% female, 82.2% Caucasian), exploratory factor analysis suggested the presence of 
two factors: (1) alcohol use leads to e-cig use (Scale 1; α=0.85); and (2) e-cig use leads to alcohol 
use (Scale 2; α=0.91). In the second sample (N=714, mean age=34.1, SD=10.89, 47.8% female, 
75.6% Caucasian), confirmatory factor analysis supported this factor structure (χ2=47.00, p<0.01, 
df=19; RMSEA=0.08, 90% CI=0.05–0.11; TLI=0.99; CFI=0.99). Compared to non e-cig users, e-
cig users had significantly higher problematic alcohol use in both samples (b’s=0.09 to 0.14, p’s<.
05). Expectancies of combined e-cig and alcohol use were significantly related to problematic 
alcohol use (b’s=−0.92 to 0.26, p’s<.05). In sum, e-cig use is related to alcohol use and 
expectancies of combined e-cig and alcohol use; consequently, reshaping of beliefs about needs or 
desires to co-use could be a prime point of intervention.

1. Introduction
Electronic cigarettes (e-cigs) are electronic nicotine delivery systems that were created to 
approximate the look and feel of a cigarette (1). Recent research has found similarities 
between e-cigs and cigarettes, particularly in increasing blood nicotine levels (2) nicotine 
absorption (3–5), and serum cotinine levels (6, 7). Recently, e-cig use prevalence rates have 
increased to 6.2% in the general population (8) and 17% in substance dependent populations 
(9), likely as a result of comprehensive smoking bans (10) and perceived health benefits of 
e-cigs (11–13). However, although research does not currently support the efficacy of e-cigs 
for smoking cessation or other health benefits (14–18), many users report using e-cigs to 
stop traditional cigarette use, to circumvent smoking bans, and because e-cigs are perceived 
as less harmful than cigarettes (8). This high prevalence of e-cig use is likely driven by 
positive expectations about the use of e-cigs. However, this high prevalence is problematic 
because e-cig liquids contain potentially harmful substances such as propylene glycol and 
contain nicotine, which can lead to addiction (19–22).
Although recent research has investigated e-cig perceptions and use in substance dependent 
populations (9), little research has examined how e-cigs influence other addictive behaviors 
in adults, particularly alcohol use. Traditional cigarettes have a well-established relationship 
with alcohol use (23–27) and cigarette smokers are at a higher risk for developing an alcohol 
use disorder (AUD; 28). Additionally, nicotine consumption has been linked to alcohol 
consumption in multiple ways. First, the mesolimbic dopamine system is responsible for the 
reinforcing effects of substances of abuse (29), and might subsequently contribute to the 
motivation to seek both alcohol and nicotine (30–32); in this way, the dopamine system 
serves as a plausible mechanism for the high rates of nicotine and alcohol co-use, and could 
generalize to concurrent alcohol and e-cig use. Second, Rohsenow and colleagues (33) 
propose a “priming hypothesis,” in which tobacco serves as a conditioned stimulus for 
alcohol consumption and vice versa. Such conditioned processes likely contribute to high 
rates of co-use between alcohol and cigarettes, and may generalize to e-cig and alcohol co-
use. Third, nicotine has been found to mitigate the sedative effect of alcohol, as nicotine is 
alerting in small doses (34). These and other learned expectancies of combined cigarette and 
alcohol use (e.g., If I drink and smoke, I will be more sociable) are implicated in the 
relationship between cigarette and alcohol use (36–38). From such beliefs arise combined 
expectancies, which have previously been measured using the Nicotine and Other Substance 
Interaction Expectancy Questionnaire (NOSIE; 39), which assesses expectancies of 
combined smoking and substance use through 29 items that fall onto four scales: a) 
substance use increases tobacco use urges (e.g., I need a cigarette while I am drinking or 
using drugs); b) smoking increases substance use urges (e.g., Smoking gives me more desire 
for alcohol or drugs); c) smoking to cope with substance urges (e.g., I have smoked a 
cigarette in order to try and decrease my urge to drink or use drugs); and d) openness to

 quitting smoking during substance use treatment (e.g., I believe that I should try to quit 
smoking).
Given the similarities of e-cigs and cigarettes, expectancies of combined e-cig and alcohol 
use might also be similarly related to alcohol use behaviors; however, no studies have 
examined this. Elucidating whether such combined expectancies would lead to increased 
alcohol consumption can lead to a better understanding of the potential harm of using e-cigs, 
particularly for those at risk for developing alcohol use disorders and/or for those who are 
more likely to use e-cigs (9). The goals of the present studies were: a) to adapt the NOSIE to 
assess expectancies of combined e-cig and alcohol use (NOSIE-ER), and b) to examine and 
characterize the relationship between e-cig use, expectancies, and alcohol use across e-cig 
use status.
2. Methods
2.1. Participants
Two independent samples were collected using identical methods and measures. Participants 
who met study inclusion criteria (21 years or older, able to read and understand questions in 
English, live in the United States, and drink alcohol), signed up to participate online through 
Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (www.mturk.com; MTurk), which is an online web service that 
connects researchers with individuals willing to complete tasks for a wage. The MTurk 
subject pool has recently been used to research an array of psychological constructs, 
including addiction (40), personality (41), relationships (42), self-injury (43) and grief (44). 
MTurk samples have shown good test-retest reliability, with less than two percent showing 
inconsistent responses across one week (45).
2.2. Measures
2.2.1. E-cig Use Status—Participants responded to face valid e-cig use (“Do you use 
electronic-cigarettes currently” with 3 response options - “No”, “Yes, I use e-cigarettes 
regularly [daily]”, “Yes, I use e-cigarettes, in social contexts only”), and cigarette use (“Do 
you smoke cigarettes currently” with 3 response options - “No”, “Yes, I smoke cigarettes 
regularly [daily]”, “Yes, I smoke cigarettes, in social contexts only”) items. Those reporting 
daily e-cig use and no cigarette use were designated “regular,” those reporting e-cig use in 
social contexts and no cigarette use were designated “social,” those reporting daily e-cig use 
and any cigarette use were designated “regular dual,” and those reporting e-cig use in social 
contexts and any cigarette use were designated “social dual.”
E-cig use frequency was assessed in Sample 1 with one item created for this study (“How 
often do you use an e-cig?” with 4 response options – “Monthly or less,” “Weekly or less,” 
“At least daily,” and “10x a day or more”). The purpose of the item was to validate the 
measure of social versus daily e-cig use. More social users, compared to regular users, 
reported using e-cigs monthly or less, χ2=80.78, p<.001, and weekly or less, χ2=16.28, p<.
001, while more regular users, compared to social users, reported using e-cigs at least daily, 
χ2=46.10, p<.001, and at least 10 times per day, χ2=19.96, p<.001 (Figure 1). Amount of 
cigarettes smoked per day was examined using one item created for the study (“How many 
cigarettes do you smoke per day?” with 4 response options – “10 or less,” “11–20”, “21 to

 30,” and “31 or more”). Social dual and regular dual e-cig users did not vary on the amount 
of cigarettes smoked per day (Figure 1).
2.2.2. E-cigs and Alcohol Use Expectancies—E-cig using participants completed the 
Nicotine and Other Substance Interaction Expectancies-E-cig Revised version (NOSIE-ER), 
which was adapted from the NOSIE to reflect combined expectancies of e-cig use and 
alcohol consumption (39). The original NOSIE contains 29 items; only the 8 items on Scale 
1 and Scale 2 of the NOSIE were modified for use in the NOSIER-ER as they were the most 
relevant to measuring combined expectancies. Scores on the NOSIE have shown acceptable 
to good reliability (α=0.69 to 0.81), and are related to level of nicotine dependence (r=0.13, 
p<.05), number of heavy drinking days (r=0.13, p<.05), and drug use (r=0.14, p<.05; 39). 
The adapted NOSIE-ER consists of eight true/false items that assess expectations about e-
cig use increasing alcohol consumption and alcohol consumption increasing e-cig use (see 
Table 1). Total data from the NOSIE-ER had good reliability in both samples (α=0.88 and 
α=0.84) and data were approximately normally distributed in Sample 1 (mean=3.24, 
SD=2.65, skewness=0.30, kurtosis=−1.06) and Sample 2 (mean=3.06, SD=2.50, 
skewness=0.322, kurtosis=−0.90). The NOSIE-ER was related measures of alcohol 
consumption in the present studies (see Section 3.2 and 4.2).
2.2.3 Alcohol Use—The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT; 46) is a ten-
item scale that assesses hazardous alcohol consumption, abnormal alcohol consumption 
behavior, and alcohol related problems. Data obtained by the AUDIT allows for 
discriminating between hazardous and non-hazardous drinkers (46), with AUDIT responses 
showing concurrent validity with other measures of alcohol use (47). The AUDIT 
demonstrated good reliability in both samples (α=0.85 and α=0.81).
The Timeline Follow-Back (TLFB; 48) aids participants in estimating daily alcohol 
consumption. Participants were asked to indicate the number of drinks they consumed each 
day over a two-week period. Total number of drinks was calculated by summing the total 
number of drinks each individual consumed over the two-week period. Average number of 
drinks per drinking day was calculated by dividing the sum of the total number of drinks 
consumed over the two-week period by the total number of alcohol consumption days. 
Responses on the TLFB have adequate test-retest reliability for days abstinent from alcohol, 
days with alcohol consumption and without a binge episode, and days with binge episodes in 
social drinkers (48). The TLFB also demonstrated high convergent validity with the 
Addiction Severity Index (49).
2.2.4 Careless Responding—As suggested by Meade & Craig (2012; 50), careless 
responding was assessed by the use of four “bogus items” placed randomly throughout the 
test (“I have never brushed my teeth,” “I do not understand a word of English,” I sleep less 
than one hour per night,” and “I have been to every country in the world”), with one 
proceeding the TLFB, one preceding the AUDIT, and two proceeding a measure unrelated 
to the present study. Participants responded to items on a 1 (agree strongly) to 7 (disagree 
strongly) scale. It was determined a priori that answering a 1 or 2 on two or more bogus 
items would result in that participant’s data being removed for study analyses.

 2.3 Procedure
Workers on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk self-selected to take part in this online study, which 
was listed as “E-cig, Cigarette, and Alcohol Use Study.” Participants were given a link to 
the survey location, where inclusion criteria were reassessed and those who met inclusion 
completed study measures. Participants who completed the study received $0.75 in 
compensation, which is in line with the average MTurk hourly wage of $1.40 (51). 
Participants who failed two or more bogus items were removed from all analyses (N=51 and 
88, across both samples). Less than 0.01% of the data were missing at random; therefore, 
were imputed through linear interpolation, which produces less biased results compared to 
other imputation techniques (52).
3. Sample 1 Results
3.1. Exploratory Factor Analysis
The final sample size was N=692 (n=225 e-cig users, mean age=32.6, SD=9.74, 50.7% 
female, 82.2% Caucasian; Table 2). Principal Axis Factoring (PAF) using exploratory factor 
analysis with promax rotation was conducted, which revealed two factors in the NOSIE-ER 
(determined by eigenvalue>1, scree plot, parallel analysis) replicating previous work with 
the original NOSIE (39) (Table 1): alcohol use leads to e-cig use (Scale 1, e.g., It is second 
nature for me to pick up an e-cig while I am drinking; 5 items.) and e-cig use leads to 
alcohol use (Scale 2, e.g., I tend to drink more after I use my e-cigarette; 3 items). Scale 1 
(α=0.85) was approximately normally distributed (mean=2.62, SD=1.95, skewness=−0.15, 
kurtosis=−1.53), with scores ranging from 0 to 5. Scale 2 (α=0.91) was approximately 
normally distributed (mean=0.61, SD=1.11, skewness=1.45, kurtosis=0.37), with scores 
ranging from 0 to 3. The two scales were significantly correlated (r=0.45, p<.001).
3.2. Relationships with variables of interest
Hierarchal linear regressions (Table 3), controlling for age, gender and ethnicity, indicated 
significant differences in alcohol use variables across e-cig use status (dummy coded 0-no e-
cig use, 1-e-cig use). E-cig users reported significantly higher a) AUDIT scores, b=1.29, p=.
001, b) Total drinks, b=2.12, p=.05, and c) Average number of drinks per drinking day, 
b=0.33, p=.02 (see Table 4 for mean scores on drinking measures by e-cig use status).
An Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA; Table 5), controlling for age, gender and ethnicity, 
indicated that NOSIE-ER Scale 1 scores differed across e-cig status (regular user, social 
user, regular dual user, social dual user), F(6,218)=3.50, p<.01, but Scale 2 scores did not 
F(6, 218)=0.58, p=.67 . Follow-up tests using Tukey’s HSD revealed that, on Scale 1, 
regular e-cig users (mean=3.15, SD=1.89) scored significantly higher than social-dual users 
(mean=2.08, SD=1.97). Non-users were not included in analysis, as they did not complete 
the NOSIE-ER.
Hierarchical linear regressions found that, after controlling for age, gender and ethnicity, 
total NOSIE-ER scores were significantly associated with a) AUDIT scores, ΔR2=0.04, p=.
01, and b) Total drinks, ΔR2=0.03, p=.03, above and beyond demographic variables, but 
Average drinks per drinking day was not, ΔR2=0.01, p=.32. Hierarchical linear regressions

 were then conducted with the NOSIE-ER scales entered separately (Table 6). Scale 1 was 
significantly associated with a) AUDIT scores, b=0.39, p=.03, b) Total drinks, b=1.01, p=.
02, and showed a trend for Average number of drinks per drinking day, b=0.11, p=0.13. 
Scale 2 was not significantly correlated with AUDIT scores, b=0.37, p=.25, Total drinks, b=.
07, p=0.94, or Average number of drinks per drinking day, b=-.07, p=.56.
4. Sample 2 Results
4.1. Confirmatory Factor Analysis
Nineteen individuals were removed from the analyses because their alcohol consumption 
measures were >3.13 SD from the sample mean. The final sample size was N=714 (n=221 e-
cig users, mean age=34.1, SD=10.89, 47.8% female, 75.6% Caucasian; see Table 2). We 
conducted confirmatory factor analyses using weighted least squares method of variance 
with the Lavaan package in R3.0.1 (53), the following fit indices (54): χ2 (p>.05); Root 
Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA<0.10); Tucker Lewis Index (TLI>0.95); and 
Comparative Fit Index (CFI>0.95). We tested a model (see Figure 2) supported by the initial 
exploratory factor analysis, with items 1–5 loading on the alcohol use leads to e-cig use 
(Scale 1) and items 6–8 loading onto the e-cig use leads to alcohol use (Scale 2). Fit indices 
for this model were good, suggesting adequate fit for the model: χ2=47.00, p<.01, df=19; 
RMSEA=0.08, 90% CI=0.05–0.11; TLI=0.99; CFI=0.99. Scale 1 (α=0.85) was 
approximately normally distributed (mean=2.57, SD=1.95, skewness=−0.09, kurtosis=
−1.53), with scores ranging from 0 to 5. Scale 2 (α=0.94) was approximately normally 
distributed (mean=0.49, SD=1.05, skewness=1.83, kurtosis=1.576), with scores ranging 
from 0 to 3. The two scales were significantly correlated (r=0.33, p<.001).
4.2. Relationships with variables of interest
As in sample 1, hierarchical regression analyses (Table 7), controlling for age, gender and 
ethnicity, indicated that e-cig users reported significantly higher AUDIT scores than non e-
cig users, b=0.91, p=.01, and Average drinks per drinking day, b=0.29, p=.10 (see Table 4), 
but not for Total drinks, b=1.4, p=.17.
An ANCOVA (Table 5), controlling for age, gender and ethnicity, indicated that NOSIE-ER 
Scale 1 scores did not differ significantly by e-cig smoking status (regular user, social user, 
regular dual user, social dual user), F(5,215)=1.54, p=.18, nor did Scale 2 scores, 
F(3,216)=1.80, p=.15. Non-users were not included in analysis, as they did not complete the 
NOSIE-ER
Hierarchical linear regression, controlling for age, gender, and ethnicity, found that, similar 
to Study 1, total NOSIE-ER scores were significantly associated with AUDIT scores, 
ΔR2=0.07, p<.001, above and beyond demographics. Average drinks per drinking day, 
ΔR2=0.01, p=0.20 and Total Drinks, ΔR2=0.01, p=.37, were not significantly associated 
with total NOSIE-ER scores. Hierarchical linear regressions were then conducted with the 
NOSIE-ER scales entered separately (Table 8). In contrast to findings in Sample 1, Scale 1 
was not significantly associated with AUDIT scores, b=0.04, p=.82, or Total drinks, b=.19, 
p=.67, and there was a trend towards significance for Average number of drinks per drinking 
day, b=0.14, p=.07. Scale 2 NOSIE-ER scores were significantly associated with AUDIT

 scores, b=1.20, p<.001, but not Total drinks, b=0.92, p=.26, or Average number of drinks 
per drinking day, b=-.08, p=.55.
5. General Discussion
Overall, the data from these two independent samples suggest that e-cigs have a similar 
relationship to alcohol use as do traditional cigarettes. As assessed with our newly created 
scale, the NOSIE-ER, e-cig users report combined expectancies of e-cig use and alcohol use 
that are associated with alcohol use. These findings are consistent with previous findings 
indicating that combined expectancies for alcohol and tobacco use contribute to increased 
tobacco and alcohol use and AUDs (36–38). E-cig users report higher levels of alcohol use 
than non e-cig users, suggesting either that e-cig users are at a higher risk for more 
problematic alcohol use or problematic alcohol users are more likely to use e-cigs. Previous 
literature has found high e-cig use prevalence rates among substance using populations (9); 
however, no causal direction has been established to date. Considering that the relationship 
between cigarettes and alcohol consumption is likely bidirectional (25, 27, 55–57), a similar 
bidirectional relationship between e-cig and alcohol use would not be surprising.
The finding that regular e-cig users are endorsing significantly higher problematic alcohol 
consumption is concerning, despite the unknown causal direction. First, e-cigs can be used 
where traditional cigarettes have been banned and where alcohol is consumed, such as bars 
and restaurants. Smoking bans inadvertently decreased public alcohol consumption among 
hazardous drinkers (49–50) perhaps through the extinction of classical conditioning 
associations between cigarettes and public alcohol consumption. However, given that e-cigs 
can be used in these locations, e-cig users are able to consume alcohol and use their e-cig 
together in time and place, which could undo the protective effects of smoking bans on 
problematic drinking. Also, smokers frequently endorse e-cig use as a smoking cessation 
device (15–18). If e-cigs are introduced as a smoking cessation device, interventions may 
perpetuate alcohol consumption or extend the nicotine addiction, especially among those at 
risk for alcohol and/or nicotine use disorders. This risk could be especially heightened 
among adolescents given their increased prevalence of e-cig use (58–59).
Many individuals endorse using e-cigs because they believe they are healthier than 
cigarettes, to circumvent smoking bans, and to quit smoking (10). Despite these 
endorsements, there is minimal empirical knowledge about the health effects of e-cigs. 
Results from the current study may suggest that e-cig use might cause inadvertent harm in 
adults at risk for AUDs, which is a novel finding that warrants further investigations. 
Expectancies about combined alcohol and e-cig use could serve as an intervention point for 
individuals at risk for developing an AUD who wish to or are currently using e-cigs. For 
example, interventions could challenge these expectancies of a need or desire to co-use e-
cigs and alcohol. Indeed, previous literature has shown that: (1) expectancies play a causal 
role in nicotine use (60); (2) expectancy interventions are efficacious in reducing alcohol 
consumption (61); and (3) targeting both nicotine and alcohol use are an important part of 
substance treatment (26). Clinicians could challenge these perceived desires or expectancies 
to co-use e-cigs and alcohol (62).

 Despite being cross-sectional in design and utilizing self-report measures, findings of the 
present studies suggest initial evidence supporting viability for future work examining the 
theory that alcohol consumption and e-cig use are related and may influence each other. This 
theory can be improved and expanded upon by future experimental, longitudinal, and 
clinical studies. Expectancies, craving, and dopaminergic processes should be examined as 
viable mechanisms underlying combined e-cig and alcohol use. These future studies should 
examine bidirectional causality. In particular, the NOSIE-ER may serve as a first step at 
examining this bidirectional effect between e-cig use and alcohol use, given that Scale 1 
assesses alcohol leading to e-cig use and Scale 2 assesses e-cig use leading to alcohol use; 
however, the cross-sectional design of the current study limits such conclusions.
There are some limitations to the current study. First, although “bogus items” were included 
in the survey, validity of online survey data can be questionable. “Bogus items” were 
included between the scales and used a different response scale, which may have drawn 
participant’s attention to them, thus underestimating the amount of random responders. 
However, 100% of those failing the random responding checks were missing more than 75% 
of their data, which appeared to occur systematically at the end of the survey; as such, it was 
likely these individuals began the study and did not complete the study rather than 
responding randomly. Second, because participants self-selected for the study, individuals 
who used e-cigs, cigarettes, and alcohol were more likely to participate, which might have 
biased study findings. However, it is important to note that MTurk has recently been used to 
research an array of psychological constructs (40–44) and MTurk data has shown good test-
retest reliability (45). Third, e-cig and cigarette use were assessed through single face-valid 
items, which asked participants to choose between social or regular use. The relationships of 
e-cig status with alcohol use outcomes might differ if cigarette and e-cig use was measured 
as a continuum (e.g., amount used in a week) rather than a dichotomy. Past studies have 
characterized e-cig use based on past 30-day use (63). Despite this possible limitation, recent 
literature has highlighted the importance of examining dual e-cig and cigarette users (64), as 
assessed in the present study. Overall this study was unique in assessing e-cig use by social 
use, regular use, regular dual use, and social dual use. It necessitates that future studies use 
these distinctions in examining e-cig use behavior such as motivations for e-cig use (e.g., to 
circumvent smoking bans, for smoking cessation). Though more research is needed on the 
relationship between e-cig use and alcohol consumption, these findings suggest that 
clinicians should make careful consideration when discussing e-cig use with individuals, 
particularly with those at risk for an AUD, as there are likely unintended consequences 
associated with e-cig use.

E-cig Use Frequency for Social and Regular E-cig Users and Smokers
Sample 1 e-cig use frequency by e-cig use status (left). Chi-square tests of independence 
were conducted to examine the difference between social and regular e-cig users on e-cig 
use frequency. a χ2=80.78, p<.001 b χ2=16.28, p<.001 c χ2=46.10, p<.001 d χ2=19.96, p<.

Users did not differ in smoking 10 or less cigarettes, χ2=0.842, p=.36, 11–20 cigarettes, 
χ2=1.78, p=.18, or 21–30 cigarettes, χ2=1.92, p=.17. Comparisons were not computed for 31 
or more cigarettes, as there were not enough participants per category.

Confirmatory Factor Analysis.
Note. We tested a model supported by the initial exploratory factor analysis; with items 1–5 
loading on the alcohol use leads to e-cig use (Scale 1) and items 6–8 loading onto the e-cig 
use leads to alcohol use (Scale 2). For simplicity, error terms are not shown. Fit indices for 
this model were good, suggesting adequate fit for the model: χ2=47.00, p<0.01, df=19; 
RMSEA=0.08, 90% CI=0.05–0.11; TLI=0.99; CFI=0.99.
