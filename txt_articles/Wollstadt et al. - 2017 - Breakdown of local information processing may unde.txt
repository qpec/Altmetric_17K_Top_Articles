Abstract
The disruption of coupling between brain areas has been suggested as the mechanism
underlying loss of consciousness in anesthesia. This hypothesis has been tested previously
by measuring the information transfer between brain areas, and by taking reduced informa-
tion transfer as a proxy for decoupling. Yet, information transfer is a function of the amount
of information available in the information source—such that transfer decreases even for
unchanged coupling when less source information is available. Therefore, we reconsidered
past interpretations of reduced information transfer as a sign of decoupling, and asked
whether impaired local information processing leads to a loss of information transfer. An
important prediction of this alternative hypothesis is that changes in locally available infor-
mation (signal entropy) should be at least as pronounced as changes in information transfer.
We tested this prediction by recording local field potentials in two ferrets after administration
of isoflurane in concentrations of 0.0%, 0.5%, and 1.0%. We found strong decreases in the
source entropy under isoflurane in area V1 and the prefrontal cortex (PFC)—as predicted by
our alternative hypothesis. The decrease in source entropy was stronger in PFC compared
to V1. Information transfer between V1 and PFC was reduced bidirectionally, but with a
stronger decrease from PFC to V1. This links the stronger decrease in information transfer
to the stronger decrease in source entropy—suggesting reduced source entropy reduces
information transfer. This conclusion fits the observation that the synaptic targets of isoflur-
ane are located in local cortical circuits rather than on the synapses formed by interareal
axonal projections. Thus, changes in information transfer under isoflurane seem to be a con-
sequence of changes in local processing more than of decoupling between brain areas. We
suggest that source entropy changes must be considered whenever interpreting changes in
information transfer as decoupling.

 Author summary
Currently we do not understand how anesthesia leads to loss of consciousness (LOC).
One popular idea is that we loose consciousness when brain areas lose their ability to com-
municate with each other–as anesthetics might interrupt transmission on nerve fibers
coupling them. This idea has been tested by measuring the amount of information trans-
ferred between brain areas, and taking this transfer to reflect the coupling itself. Yet, infor-
mation that isn’t available in the source area can’t be transferred to a target. Hence, the
decreases in information transfer could be related to less information being available in
the source, rather than to a decoupling. We tested this possibility measuring the informa-
tion available in source brain areas and found that it decreased under isoflurane anesthe-
sia. In addition, a stronger decrease in source information lead to a stronger decrease of
the information transfered. Thus, the input to the connection between brain areas deter-
mined the communicated information, not the strength of the coupling (which would
result in a stronger decrease in the target). We suggest that interrupted information pro-
cessing within brain areas has an important contribution to LOC, and should be focused
on more in attempts to understand loss of consciousness under anesthesia.
Introduction
To this day it is an open question in anesthesia research how general anesthesia leads to loss of
consciousness (LOC). Several recent theories agree in proposing that anesthesia-induced LOC
may be caused by the disruption of long range inter-areal information transfer in cortex [1–5]
—a hypothesis supported by a series of recent studies [3, 6–9]. In all of these studies, informa-
tion transfer is quantified using transfer entropy [10], an information theoretic measure,
which has become a quasi-standard for the estimation of information transfer in anesthesia
research, or by transfer entropy’s linear implementation as a Granger causality. In many of
these studies reduced information transfer has been interpreted as a sign of inter-areal long
range connectivity being disrupted by anesthesia.
Yet, information transfer between a source of information and a target depends on infor-
mation (entropy) being available at the source in the first place. Considering constraints of this
kind we can easily conceive of cases where a decrease in information transfer under anesthesia
is observed despite unchanged long range coupling, e.g., when the available information at the
source decreases due to an anesthesia-related change in local information processing. Ulti-
mately, this dissociation between information transfer and causal coupling just reflects that
information transfer is one possible consequence of physical coupling, but not identical to it
[11–13].
Therefore, we consider it necessary to evaluate the hypothesis that the reduced inter-areal
information transfer observed under anesthesia possibly originates from disrupted informa-
tion processing in local circuits rather than from disrupted long range connectivity. This alter-
native hypothesis receives additional support for the case of isoflurane, which potentiates
agonist actions at GABAA-receptors and inhibits nicotinic acetylcholine (nAChR) receptors.
Conversely, evidence on direct inhibitory effects of isoflurane on AMPA and NMDA synapses,
which are the dominant mediators of long-range cortico-cortical interactions, is sparse at best
(see table 2 in [14]). Under the alternative hypothesis of changed local information processing,
a decrease in transfer entropy under anesthesia must be accompanied by:

 1. a reduction in locally available information per brain area, i.e. in the sources of information
transfer,
2. and the fact that the strongest decrease in locally available information is found at the
source of the link with the strongest decrease in information transfer, rather than at its tar-
get (i.e. the end point),
Here, we perform tests of these predictions by estimating local information processing in
and information transfer between local field potentials (LFPs) simultaneously recorded from
primary visual cortex (V1) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) of two ferrets under different levels of
isoflurane. We quantify local information processing by estimating the signal entropy (mea-
suring available information) and quantified information transfer between recording sites by
estimating transfer entropy. Additionally, to demonstrate the effect of reduced source entropy
on transfer entropy, we estimated transfer entropy on simulated data with a constant coupling
between processes, but a varying source entropy.
To better understand potential changes in local information processing we also quantified
the active information storage, a measure of the information available at a recording site that
can be predicted from past signals at that site, i.e. the information stored from past to present.
Because the estimation of such information theoretic quantities from finite data is difficult
in general, we employ two complementary strategies: (i) probability density estimation based
on nearest-neighbor searches in continuous data, and (ii) Bayesian estimation based on discre-
tized data.
We also test whether the previously reported decrease of transfer entropy under anesthesia
can indeed be replicated when avoiding some recently identified pitfalls in estimation of infor-
mation transfer related to the use of symbolic time series, suboptimal embedding of the time
series, and the use of net transfer entropy without identification of the individual information
transfer delays (for problems related to these approaches see [15]).
Our results provide first evidence for the alternative hypothesis of altered local information
processing causing reduced information transfer, as the above predictions were indeed met.
We suggest to consider the alternative hypothesis as a serious candidate mechanism for LOC,
and to use causal interventions to gather further experimental evidence.
Preliminary results for this study were published in abstract form in [16].
Results
Existence of information transfer between recording sites
Before analyzing differences in information transfer induced by isoflurane, we tested for the
existence of significant information transfer between the recording sites (Table 1). For both
animals, TESPO was significant in the top-down direction, while the bottom-up direction was
significant for animal 1 only. A non-significant information transfer in bottom-up direction
for animal 2 may be explained by the dark experimental environment, i.e., the lack of visual
input.
Changes in information theoretic measures under anesthesia
Overall, for higher isoflurane levels both locally available information and information transfer
were decreased, while information storage in local activity increased.
As the estimation of information theoretic measures from finite length neural recordings
poses a considerable challenge we present detailed, converging results from two complemen-
tary strategies to deal with this challenge—nearest-neighbor based estimators, and a Bayesian
approach to entropy estimation suggested by Nemenman, Shafe, and Bialek (NSB-estimator)

 [17, 18]. This latter approach required a discretization of the continuous-valued LFP data, but
yields principled control of bias, while the first approach allows the estimation of information-
theoretic measures directly from continuous data, and thus conserves the information origi-
nally present in those data. Statistical testing was performed using a nonparametric permuta-
tion ANOVA (pANOVA), and a linear mixed model (LMM). The LMM approach was used in
addition to the main pANOVA for the purpose of comparison to older studies using paramet-
ric statistics.
Results based on next neighbor-based estimation from continuous data. For higher iso-
flurane levels, we found an overall reduction in the locally available information (H), and in
the information transfer (TESPO). We found an increase in the locally predictable (stored)
information (AIS) (Table 2 and Fig 1).
In general, H decreased in both animals under higher isoflurane levels (main effect isoflur-
ane level, p < 0.01�� for ferret 1 and p < 0.001��� for ferret 2), indicating a reduction of locally
available information for higher isoflurane concentrations. Yet, an isoflurane concentration of
0.5% (abbreviated as iso 0.5%, with other concentrations abbreviated accordingly) led to a
slight increase in H for ferret 1, followed by a decrease for concentration iso 1.0%, which was
below initial entropy values. This rise in H in condition iso 0.5% was present only in V1 of fer-
ret 1, while H decreased monotonically in PFC. In ferret 2, H increased monotonically in both

region) was significant for both animals (p < 0.001��� for ferret 1 and p < 0.01�� for ferret 2).
The information transfer as measured by the self prediction optimal transfer entropy
(TESPO, [15]) decreased significantly with higher levels of isoflurane in both animals (main
effect isoflurane level, p < 0.001���), indicating an overall reduction in information transfer.
This reduction was stronger in the top-down direction PFC ! V1 (significant interaction
effect isoflurane level x direction in ferret 1, p < 0.01��). In ferret 2 this interaction was not sig-
nificant in the permutation ANOVA (pANOVA) on aggregated data, but was highly signifi-
cant using the LMM approach (see next section).
The stored information as measured by the active information storage (AIS, [19]) increased
in both animals under higher isoflurane levels (main effect isoflurane level, p < 0.01�� for ferret
1 and p < 0.001��� for ferret 2), indicating more predictable information in LFP signals under
higher levels of isoflurane. In ferret 1 the concentration iso 0.5% led to a slight decrease in AIS,
followed by an increase compared to initial levels for concentration iso 1.0%. This initial

 decrease in AIS in condition iso 0.5% was present only in V1 of this animal, while in its PFC
AIS increased monotonically. In ferret 2, AIS increased monotonically in both recording sites,
with a stronger increase in PFC. The interaction effect was significant for both animals
(p < 0.001��� for ferret 1 and p < 0.01�� for ferret 2). Overall, AIS behaved complementary to
H for all animals and isoflurane levels, despite the fact that AIS is one component of H [19].
Alternative statistical testing using linear mixed models. We additionally performed a
parametric test, using linear mixed models (LMM) on non-aggregated data from individual
epochs of recording sessions (adding recording as additional random factor to encode the
recording session) to enable a comparison to results from earlier studies using parametric
testing.
For both animals, model comparison showed a significant main effect of factor isoflurane
level on TESPO, AIS, and H as well as a significant interaction of factors isoflurane level and
direction (see Table 3). The only exception to this was the factor direction in the evaluation of
TESPO in Ferret 2. Thus, the results of this alternative statistical analysis were in agreement

Bayesian estimation on discretized data. In addition to the neighbor-distance based esti-

posed by Nemenman, Shafe, and Bialek (NSB) [17, 18] to our data. The Bayesian approach
promises to yield unbiased estimators when priors are chosen appropriately. However, one has
to keep in mind that these estimators currently require the discretization of continuous data,
and therefore may loose important information.
When applying the NSB estimator to the discretized LFP time series with Nbins discretiza-
tion steps, we observed that for Nbins � 8 the results were qualitatively consistent for different
choices of numbers of bins. We present results for Nbins = 12 (Fig 2), which provides a

 reasonable resolution of the signal while still allowing for a reliable estimation of entropies
within the scope of available data.
We confirmed the reliability of the estimator by systematically reducing the sample size and
found no substantial impact on our estimates (Fig 3).
The estimation of H, AIS, and TESPO by Bayesian techniques for the binned signal represen-
tations provided results that were qualitatively consistent with results from the neighbor-dis-
tance based estimation techniques (compare Figs 1 and 2, and Tables 2 and 4). While the
Bayesian estimates showed larger variances across different recordings and sample sizes, on
average, we saw a decrease of TESPO and H for higher concentrations of isoflurane (main effect
isoflurane level), while AIS increased for higher concentrations. For ferret 1 we also found an
interaction effect for TESPO, with a stronger reduction in information transfer in top-down
direction.
Note that we also applied an alternative Bayesian estimation scheme based on Pitman-Yor-
process priors [20]. However, for this estimation procedure, we observed that the data were

cated by large variances and unreasonably high estimates across different sample sizes.
Simulated effects of changed source entropy on transfer entropy.
To test the effect of
reduced source entropy on TESPO between a source and target process, we simulated two test
cases with high and low source entropy respectively. In both test cases signals were based on
the original recordings, and the coupling between source and target was held constant (see
Methods).
We found significantly higher TESPO in the case with high source entropy than in the case
with low source entropy (Fig 4A). The simulation thus demonstrated that a lower source
entropy does indeed lead to a reduction in TESPO despite an unchanged coupling. Information
transfer in the high-entropy case was similar to the average information transfer found in
recordings under an isoflurane concentration of 0.0%, indicating that the simulation scheme
mirrored information transfer found in the experimental recordings.
Optimized embedding parameters for TESPO and AIS estimation
As noted in the introduction, the estimation of information theoretic measures from finite
data is challenging. For the measures that describe distributed computation in complex sys-
tems, such as transfer entropy, estimation is further complicated because the available data are
typically only scalar observations of a process with multidimensional dynamics. This necessi-
tates the approximate reconstructions of the process’ states via a form of embedding [21],
where a certain number of past values of the scalar observations spaced by an embedding delay
are taken into account (e.g. for a pendulum swinging through its zero position one additional
past position values will clarify whether it’s going left or right). An important part of proper
transfer entropy estimation is thus optimization of this number of past values (embedding
dimension), and of the embedding delay. These two embedding parameters then approxi-
mately define past states, whose correct identification is crucial for the estimation of transfer

 entropy [22], but also for the estimation of active information storage. Without it information
storage may be underestimated and, erroneous values of the information transfer will be
obtained; even a detection of information transfer in the wrong direction is likely (see [15, 22,
23] and Methods section). Existing studies using transfer entropy often omitted the optimiza-
tion of embedding parameters, and instead used ad-hoc choices, which may have had a detri-
mental effect on the estimation of transfer entropy—hence the need for a confirmation of
previous results in this study.
In the present study, we therefore used a formal criterion proposed by Ragwitz [21], to find
an optimal embedding defined by the embedding dimension d (the number of values col-
lected) and delay τ (the temporal spacing between them), to find embeddings for the TESPO
and AIS past states. We used the implementation of this criterion provided by the TRENTOOL
toolbox. Since the bias of the estimators used depends on d, we used the maximum d over all
conditions and directions of interaction as the common embedding dimension for estimation
from each epoch to make the estimated values statistically comparable. The resulting dimen-
sion used was 15 samples, which is considerably higher than the value commonly used in the
literature [6, 7], when choosing the embedding dimension ad-hoc or using other criteria as for
example the sample size [9]. The embedding delay τ was optimized individually for single
epochs in each condition and animal as it has no influence on the estimator bias.
Relevance of individual information transfer delay estimation
Several previous studies on information transfer under anesthesia reported the sign of the so
called net transfer entropy (TEnet) as a measure of the predominant direction of information
transfer between two sources. TEnet is essentially just the normalized difference between the
transfer entropies measured in the two direction connecting a pair of recording sites (see
Methods). When calculating TEnet, it is particularly important to individually account for
physical delays δ in the two potential directions of information transfer, because otherwise the
sign of TEnet may become meaningless (see examples in [15]). As this delay is unknown a pri-
ori it has to be found prior to the actual estimation of information transfer. We have recently
shown that this can be done by using a variable delay parameter u in a delay sensitive transfer
entropy estimator TESPO (see Methods); here, the u that maximizes the transfer entropy over a
range of assumed values for u reflects the physical delay [15].
The necessity to individually optimize u for each interaction is not a mere theoretical con-
cern but was clearly visible in the present study: Fig 5C shows representative results from ferret
1 under 0.0% isoflurane, where apparent TESPO values strongly varied as a function of the
delay u. As a consequence, TEnet values also varied if a common delay u was chosen for both
directions. In other words, the sign of the TEnet varied as a function of individual choices for
uPFC ! V1 and uV1 ! PFC for each direction of information transfer and hence became uninter-
pretable (Fig 5D).
As a consequence of the above, we here individually optimized u for each direction of infor-
mation transfer in each condition and animal to estimate the true delay of information transfer
following the mathematical proof in [15]. We individually optimized u to obtain estimates of
transfer entropy that were not biased by a non-optimal choice for u. We used the implementa-
tion in TRENTOOL [23] and scanned values for u ranging from 0 to 20 ms. Averages for opti-
mized delays ranged from 4–7 ms across animals and isoflurane levels (Fig 6).
Note that in Fig 5C, TESPO as a function of u shows multiple peaks, especially for the direc-
tion V1 ! PFC. Since these peaks resembled an oscillatory pattern close to the low-pass filter
frequency used for preprocessing the data, we investigated the influence of filtering on delay
reconstruction by simulating two coupled time series for which we reconstructed the delay

 with and without prior band-pass filtering (Fig 7). For filtered, simulated data TESPO as a func-
tion of u indeed showed an oscillatory pattern for certain filter settings. However, broadband
filtering—as used here for the original data—did not lead to the reconstruction of an incorrect
value for the delay δ (Fig 7C). Yet, when filtering using narrower bandwidths, the reconstruc-
tion of the correct information transfer delay failed (Fig 7D–7F). This finding supports the
general notion that filtering, especially narrow-band filtering, may only be applied with cau-
tion before estimating connectivity measures [24, 25].
Yet, since broad-band filtering did not lead to the observed oscillatory patterns in the simu-
lated data, alternative explanations for multiple peaks in TESPO are more likely: one alternative
cause of multiple peaks in the TESPO are multiple information transfer channels with various
delays between source and target (see [15], especially Fig 6). Each information transfer
channel with its individual delay will be detected when estimating TESPO as a function of
Fig 5. Estimation of information transfer delays. (A, modified from [15]) estimation of transfer entropy

 u (see simulations in [15]). A further possible cause for multiple peaks in the TESPO is the exis-
tence of a feedback loop between the source of TESPO and a third source of neural activity [15].
In such a feedback loop, information in the source is fed back to the source such that it occurs
again at a later point in time, leading to the repeated transfer of identical bits of information.
Both causes are potential explanations for the occurrence of multiple peaks in the TESPO in the
present study—yet, deciding between these potential causes requires additional research, spe-
cifically interventional approaches to the causal structure underlying the observed information
transfer.
In sum, our results clearly indicate the necessity to individually optimize information trans-
fer delays and that often employed ad-hoc choices for u may result in spurious results in infor-
mation transfer. The additional simulations of filtering effects showed that narrow-band
filtering may have detrimental effects on this optimization procedure and should thus be
avoided.
Relation of information-theoretic measures with other time-series
properties
The information-theoretic measures used in this study are relatively novel and have been
applied in neuroscience research rarely. Thus, it is conceivable that these measures quantify
signal properties that are more easily captured by traditional time-series measures, namely, the
autocorrelation decay time (ACT), the signal variance, and the power in individual frequency
bands. To investigate the overlap between information-theoretic and traditional measures, we
calculated correlations between AIS and ACT, between H and signal variance, between TESPO
and ACT, between TESPO and signal variance, and between AIS, H, and TESPO and the power
in various frequency bands, respectively. Fig 8 shows average ACT, signal variance, and power
over recordings, for individual isoflurane levels and recording sites, and for both animals.
Detailed tables showing correlation coefficients and explained variances are provided as
supporting information S1 to S6 Tables. In summary, for AIS and ACT we found significant
correlations in both animals, however the median of the variance explained, ~
R2, over individ-
ual recordings was below 0.1 for each significant correlation in an animal, recording site and
isoflurane level. Hence, even though there was some shared variance between ACT and AIS,
there remained a substantial amount of unexplained variance in AIS, indicating that AIS

 quantified properties other than the signal’s ACT—in line with results from our earlier studies
[27, 28]. This is expected because the autocorrelation (decay) time ACT measures how long
information persists in a time series in a linear encoding, while AIS, in contrast, measures how
much information is stored (at any moment), and also reflects nonlinear transformations of
this information. The fact that there is still some shared variance between the two measures
here may be explained by the construction of the AIS’s past state embedding, where the time
steps between the samples in the embedding vector are defined as a fractions of the ACT.
Between H and signal variance, we found no significant correlation; moreover, correlations
for individual recordings were predominantly negative.

 The TESPO was significantly correlated with source ACT for an isoflurane level of 1.0%. Also
for the correlation of TESPO and the source’s variance, we found significant correlations for the
bottom-up direction under 0.5% and 1.0% isoflurane in animal 1, and for both directions under
1.0% isoflurane in animal 2. For all significant correlations we found ~
R2 � 0:015, again indicat-
ing a substantial amount of variance in TESPO that was not explained by ACT or signal variance.
When correlating band power with information-theoretic measures, we found significant
correlations between AIS and all bands in both animals animals (see supporting information

R2 < 0:16); for H and band power, we found correlations predominantly in higher
frequency bands (beta and gamma, see supporting information S5 Table, ~
R2 < 0:1); for TESPO
and band power, we found significant correlations predominantly in the gamma band and one
significant correlation in the delta band for animal 2 and in the beta band for animal 1, respec-
tively (see supporting information S6 Table, ~
R2 < 0:024). In sum, we found relationships
between the power in individual frequency bands and all three information-theoretic mea-
sures. For all measures, the variance explained was below 0.2, indicating again that band
power did not fully capture the properties measured by TESPO, AIS, and H.
Discussion
We analyzed long-range information transfer between areas V1 and PFC in two ferrets under
different levels of isoflurane. We found that transfer entropy was indeed reduced under iso-
flurane and that this reduction was more pronounced in top-down directions. These results
validate earlier findings made using different estimation procedures [3, 6–9]. As far as infor-
mation transfer alone was concerned our results are compatible with an interpretation of
reduced long-range information transfer due to reduced inter-areal coupling. Yet, this

 interpretation provides no direct explanation for the findings of reduced locally available
information as explained below. In contrast, the alternative hypothesis that the reduced long
range information transfer is a secondary effect of changes in local information processing
provides a concise explanation for our findings both with respect to locally available informa-
tion, and information transfer.
Reduction in transfer entropy may be caused by changes in local
information processing
To test our alternative hypothesis we evaluated two of its predictions about changes in locally
available information, as measured by signal entropy, under administration of different iso-
flurane concentrations. First, entropy should be reduced; second, the strongest decrease in
information transfer should originate from the source node with the strongest decrease in
entropy, rather than end in this node. Indeed, we found that signal entropy decreased; the
most pronounced decrease in signal entropy was found in PFC. In accordance with our pre-
diction, we found that PFC—the node with the larger decrease in entropy—was also at the
source, not the target, of the most pronounced decrease in transfer entropy. This is strong evi-
dence against the theoretical possibility that in a recording site, entropy decreased due to a
reduced influx of information—because in this latter scenario the strongest reduction in
entropy should have been found at the target (end point) of the most pronounced decrease in
information transfer. Hence, our hypothesis that long-range cortico-cortical information
transfer is reduced because of changes in local processing must be taken as a serious alternative
to the currently prevailing theories of anesthetic action based on disruptions of long range
interactions. We suggest that a renewed focus on local information processing in anesthesia
research will be pivotal to advance our understanding of how consciousness is lost.
Our predictions that reductions in entropy should potentially be reflected in reduced infor-
mation transfer derives from the simple principle that information that is not available at the
source cannot be transferred. We may thus in principle reduce TESPO to arbitrarily low values
by reducing the entropy of one of the involved processes, without changing the physical cou-
pling between the two systems, just by changing their internal information processing. This
trivial but important fact has been neglected in previous studies when interpreting changes in
information transfer as changes in coupling strength. Even when this bound is not attained,
e.g. because only a certain fraction of the local information is transferred even under 0.0% iso-
flurane, it seems highly plausible that reductions in the locally available information affect the
amount of information transfered. This line of reasoning generalizes to applications beyond
anesthesia research, i.e., every application that observes changes in information transfer
between two or more experimental conditions should consider changes in local information
processing as a potential alternative cause.
A possible indication of how exactly local information processing is changed is given by the
observation of increased active information storage in PFC and V1 (also see the next para-
graph). This means that more ‘old’ information is kept stored in a source’s activity under anes-
thesia, rather than being dynamically generated. Such stored source information will not
contribute to a measurable transfer entropy under most circumstances because it is already
known at the target (see [29], section 5.2.3, for an illustrative example).
Relation between changed locally available information and information
storage
In general, AIS increases if a signal becomes more predictable when knowing it’s past, but is
unpredictable otherwise. This also means that the absolute AIS is upper-bounded by the

 system’s entropy H (see Methods, Eq 5). Thus, a decrease in H can in principle lead to a
decrease in AIS, i.e., fewer possible system states may lead to a decrease in absolute AIS. How-
ever, in the present study, we observed an increase in AIS while H decreased—this indicates an
increase in predictability that more than compensates for the decrease in locally available
information. In other words, the system visited fewer states in total but the next state visited
became more predictable from the system’s past. Thus, a reduction in entropy and increase in
predictability points at highly regular neural activity for higher isoflurane concentrations. Such
a behavior in activity is in line with existing electrophysiological findings: under anesthesia sig-
nals have been reported to become more uniform, exhibiting repetitive patterns, interrupted
by bursting activity (see [5] for a review). For example, Purdon and colleagues observed a
reduction of the median frequency and an overall shift towards high-power, low-frequency
activity during LOC [30]. In particular, slow-wave oscillatory power was more pronounced
during anesthesia-induced LOC. LOC was also accompanied by a significant increase in
power and a narrowing of oscillatory bands in the alpha frequency range in their study.
Limitations of the applied estimators and measures
Unfortunately a quantitative comparison between different information theoretic estimates
that would directly relate H, AIS and TESPO is not possible using the continuous estimators
applied in this study. Their estimates are not comparable because the bias properties of each
estimator differ. For each estimator, the bias depends on the number of points used for estima-
tion as well as on the dimensionality of involved variables—however, the exact functional
relationship between these two quantities and the bias is unknown and may differ between
estimators. (In our application, the dimensionality is determined mainly by the dimension of
the past state vectors, and by how many different state variables enter the computation of a
measure).
This lack of comparability makes it impossible to normalize estimates; for example, transfer
entropy is often normalized by the conditional entropy of the present target state to compare
the fraction of transferred information to the fraction of stored information. We forgo this
possibility of comparison for a greater sensitivity and specificity in the detection of changes in
the individual information theoretic measures here. New estimators, e.g. Bayesian estimators
like the ones tested here, promise more comparable estimates by tightly controlling the biases.
Yet, these estimators were not as reliable as expected in our study, displaying a relatively high
variance.
A further important point to consider when estimating transfer entropy between recordings
from neural sites, is the possibility of third unobserved sources influencing the information
transfer. In the present study, third sources (e.g., in the thalamus) may influence the informa-
tion transfer between PFC and V1—for example, if a third source drove the dynamics in both
areas, the areas would become correlated, leading to non-zero estimates of TESPO. This TESPO
is then attributable to the correlation between source and target, but does not measure an
actual information transfer between sources. Hence, information transfer estimated by trans-
fer entropy should in general not be directly equated with a causal connection or causal mech-
anism existing between the source and target process (see also [12] for a detailed discussion of
the difference between transfer entropy and measures of causal interactions).
Potential physiological causes for altered information transfer under
anesthesia
We here tested the possibility that changes in local information processing lead to the fre-
quently observed reduction in information transfer between cortical areas under isoflurane

 administration, instead of altered long-range coupling. Results on entropies and active infor-
mation storage suggest that this is a definite possibility from a mathematical point of view.
This is supported by the neurophysiology related to the mode of action of isoflurane, because
a dominant influence of altered long-range coupling on TESPO would mandate that synaptic ter-
minals of the axons mediating long range connectivity should be targets of isoflurane. Such
long range connectivity is thought to be dominated by glutamatergic AMPA receptors for
inter-areal bottom-up connections, and glutamatergic NMDA receptors for inter-areal top-
down connections, building upon findings in [31] and [32] (but see [33] for some evidence of
GABAergic long range connectivity). Yet, evidence for isoflurane effects on AMPA and NMDA
receptors is sparse to date (table 2 in [14]). In contrast, the receptors most strongly influenced
by isoflurane seem to be GABAA and nicotinic acetylcholine (nAChR) receptors. More specifi-
cally, isoflurane potentiates agonist interactions at the former, while inhibiting the latter.
Thus, if one adopts the current state of knowledge on the synapses involved in long-range
inter-areal connectivity, evidence speaks against a dominant effect of modulation of effective
long-range connections by isoflurane. This, in turn, points at local information processing as a
more likely reason for changed transfer entropy under isoflurane anesthesia. This interpreta-
tion is perfectly in line with our finding that decreases in source entropy seem to determine
the transfer entropy decreases, instead of decreases in transfer entropy determining the target
entropies.
Nevertheless, targeted local interventions by electrical or optogenetic activation of projec-
tion neurons, combined with the set of information theoretic analyses used here, will most
likely be necessary to reach final conclusions on the causal role of local entropy changes in
reductions of transfered information.
How may altered long-range information transfer lead to loss of
consciousness?
Investigating long-range information transfer under anesthesia is motivated by the question
how changed information transfer may cause LOC. To that effect, our findings—a dominant
decrease in top-down information transfer under anesthesia, and a decrease in locally available
information possibly driving it—may be interpreted in the framework of predictive coding
theory [34–36]. Predictive coding proposes that the brain learns about the world by construct-
ing and maintaining an internal model of the world, such that it is able to predict future sen-
sory input at lower levels of the cortical hierarchy. Whether predictions match actual future
input is then used to further refine the internal model. It is thus assumed that top-down infor-
mation transfer serves the propagation of predictions [37]. Theories of conscious perception
within this predictive coding framework propose that conscious perception is “determined”
by the internal prediction (or ‘hypothesis’) that matches the actual input best [35, p. 201]. It
may be conversely assumed that the absence of predictions leads to an absence of conscious
perception.
In the framework of predictive coding theory two possible mechanisms for LOC can be
inferred from our data: (1) the disruption of information transfer, predominantly in top-down
direction, may indicate a failure to propagate predictions to hierarchically lower areas; (2) the
decrease in locally available information and in entropy rates in PFC may indicate a failure to
integrate information in an area central to the generation of a coherent model of the world
and the generation of the corresponding predictions. These hypotheses are in line with find-
ings reviewed in [4] and [38], which discuss activity in frontal areas and top-down modulatory
activity as important to conscious perception.

 Future research should investigate top-down information transfer more closely; for exam-
ple, recent work suggests that neural activity in separate frequency bands may be responsible
for the propagation of predictions and prediction errors respectively [37, 39]. Future experi-
ments may target information transfer within a specific band to test if the disruption of top-
down information transfer happens in the frequency band responsible for the propagation of
predictions.
Last, it should be kept in mind that different anesthetics may lead to loss of consciousness
by vastly different mechanisms. Ketamine, for example, seems to increase, rather than
decrease, overall information transfer—at least in sub-anesthetic doses [40].
Comparison of the alternative approaches to the estimation of
information theoretic measures and to statistical testing
The main analysis of this study was based on information theoretic estimators relying on dis-
tances between neighboring data points and on a permutation ANOVA. As each of these has
its weaknesses we used additional alternative approaches, first, a Bayesian estimator for infor-
mation theoretic measures, and second, statistical testing of non-aggregated data using LMMs.
Both approaches returned results qualitatively very similar to those of the main analysis. Spe-
cifically, replacing neighbor-distance based estimators with Bayesian variants, we replicated
the main finding of our study—a reduction in information transfer and locally available infor-
mation, and an increase in information storage under anesthesia. However, using the Bayesian
estimators we did not find a predominant reduction of top-down compared to bottom up
information transfer. In contrast, using LMMs for statistical testing instead of a pANOVA
additionally revealed a more pronounced reduction in top-down information transfer also in
ferret 2 (in this animal, this effect was not significant when performing permutation tests
based on the aggregated data).
The Bayesian estimators performed slightly worse than the next neighbor-based estimators
in terms of their higher variance in estimates across recordings. Thus, even though Bayesian
estimators are currently the best available estimators for discrete data, they may be a non-
optimal choice for continuous data. A potential reason for this is the destruction of informa-
tion on neighborhood relationships through data binning. This is, however, necessary to make
the current Bayesian estimators applicable to continuous data.
In sum, we obtained similar results through three different approaches. This makes us con-
fident that locally available information and information transfer indeed decrease under anes-
thesia, while the amount of predictable information increases.
On information theoretic measures obtained from from continuous time
processes via time-discrete sampling
When interpreting the information theoretic measures presented in this work, it must be kept
in mind that they were obtained via time-discrete sampling of processes that unfold in contin-
uous time (such as the LFP, or spike trains). This time-discrete sampling was taken into
account in recent work by Spinney and colleagues [41], who could show that the classic trans-
fer entropy as defined by Schreiber is indeed ambiguous when applied to sampled data from
time-continuous processes—it can either be seen as the integral of a transfer entropy rate in
continuous time over one sampling interval, and is then given in bits, or it can be seen as an
approximation to the continuous time transfer entropy rate itself, and be given in bits/sec. In
our study we stick with the first notion of transfer entropy, and note that our results will
numerically change when using different sampling intervals. In contrast to the case of transfer
entropy covered in [41], corresponding analytical results for AIS are not known at present, as

 this is still a field of active research. To nevertheless elucidate the practical dependency of AIS
on the sampling rate, when using our estimators, we have taken the original data and have up-
and down-sampled them. Indeed the empirical AIS depended on the sampling rate (support-
ing information S1 Fig). Yet, all relations of AIS values between different isoflurane concentra-
tions, i.e., the qualitative results, are independent of sampling. Thus, sampling effects do not
affect the conclusions of the current study.
A cautionary note on the interpretation of information theoretic measures
evaluated on local field potential data
When interpreting the results obtained in this study it should be kept in mind that LFP signals
are not in themselves the immediate carriers of information relevant to individual neurons.
This is because from a neuron’s perspective information arrives predominantly in the form
postsynaptic potentials generated by incoming spikes and chemical transmission in the synap-
tic cleft (but see [42] for a potential influence of LFPs on neural dynamics and computation).
Thus, LFP signals merely reflect a coarse grained view of the underlying neural information
processing. As a consequence, our results only hold in as far as at least some relevant informa-
tion about the underlying information processing survives this coarse graining in the record-
ing process, and little formal mathematical work has been carried out to estimate bounds on
the amount of information available after coarse graining (but see [43]).
Yet, the enormous success that brain reading approaches had when based on local field
potentials or on even more coarse grained magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings (e.g.
[44]) indicates that relevant information on neural information processing is indeed available
at the level of these signals. However, successful attempts at decoding neural representations of
stimuli or other features of the experimental setting should not lead us to misinterpret the
information captured by information theoretic measures of neural processing as necessarily
being about something we can understand and link to the outside world. Quite to the contrary,
the larger part of information captured by these measures may be related to intrinsic properties
of the unfolding neural computation.
Conclusion
Using two different methods for transfer entropy estimation, and two different statistical
approaches, we found that locally available information and information transfer are reduced
under isoflurane administration. The larger decrease in the locally available information was
found at the source of the larger decrease of information transfer, not at its end point, or target.
Therefore, previously reported reductions in information transfer under anesthesia may be
caused by changes in local information processing rather than a disruption of long range con-
nectivity. We suggest to put this hypothesis more into the focus of future research effort to
understand the loss of consciousness under anesthesia. This suggestion receives further sup-
port from the fact that the synaptic targets of the anesthetic isoflurane, as used in this study,
are most likely located in local circuits.
Methods
Electrophysiological recordings
We conducted simultaneous electrophysiological recordings of the local field potential (LFP)
in primary visual cortex (V1) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) of two female ferrets (17 to 20 weeks
of age at study onset) under different levels of isoflurane (Fig 9). Raw data are available from
[45]. The choice of the animal model is discussed further in [46]. Recordings were made in a

 dark environment during multiple, individual sessions of max. 2 h length, during which the
animals’ heads were fixed. For recordings, we used single metal electrodes acutely inserted in
putative layer IV, measured 0.3–0.6 mm from the surface of cortex (tungsten micro-electrode,
250-μm shank diameter, 500-kO impedance, FHC, Bowdoin, ME). The hardware high pass fil-
ter was 0.1 Hz and the low pass filter was 5,000 Hz. A silver chloride wire placed between the
skull and soft tissue was used as the reference electrode. The reference electrode was located
approximately equidistant between the recording electrodes. This location was selected in
order to have little shared activity with either recording electrode. The same reference was
used for both recording locations; also the same electrode position was used for both animals
and all isoflurane concentrations. To verify that electrode placement was indeed in V1, we
mapped receptive fields by eliciting visually evoked potentials in a separate series of experi-
ments. We confirmed electrode placement in PFC by lesioning through the recording elec-
trode after completion of data collection and post-mortem histology (as described in [46]).
Details on surgical procedures can be found in [47]. Unfiltered signals were amplified with
gain 1,000 (model 1800, A-M Systems, Carlsborg, WA), digitized at 20 kHz (Power 1401,
Cambridge Electronic Design, Cambridge, UK), and digitally stored using Spike2 software
(Cambridge Electronic Design). For analysis, data were low pass filtered (300 Hz cutoff) and
down-sampled to 1000 Hz.
All procedures were approved by the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee (UNC-CH IACUC) and exceed guidelines set forth by the
National Institutes of Health and U.S. Department of Agriculture.
LFPs were recorded during wakefulness (condition iso 0.0%, number of recording sessions:
8 and 5 for ferret 1 and 2, respectively) and with different concentrations of anesthetic: 0.5%
isoflurane with xylazine (condition iso 0.5%, number of sessions: 5 and 6), as well as 1.0% iso-
flurane with xylazine (condition iso 1.0%, number of sessions: 10 and 11). In the course of
pilot experiments, both concentrations iso 0.5% and iso 1.0% lead to a loss of the righting
reflex; however, a systematic assessment of this metric during recordings was technically not
feasible. Additionally, animals were administered 4.25 ml/h 5% dextrose lactated Ringer and
0.015 ml/h xylazine via IV.
LFP recordings from each session were cut into epochs of 4.81 s length to be able to remove
segments of data if they were contaminated by artifacts (e.g., due to movement). We chose a
relatively short epoch length to avoid removing large chunks of data when there was only a
short transient artifact. This resulted in 196 to 513 epochs per recording (mean: 428.6) for fer-
ret 1, and 211 to 526 epochs (mean: 472.8) for ferret 2. epochs with movement artifacts were
manually rejected (determined by extreme values in the LFP raw traces). In the iso 0.0% condi-
tion, infrared videography was used to verify that animals were awake during the whole
recording; additionally, iso 0.0% epochs with a relative delta power (0.5 to 4.0 Hz) of more
than 30% of the total power from 0.5 to 50 Hz were rejected to ensure that only epochs during
which the animal was truly awake entered further analysis.

 Information theoretic measures
To measure information transfer between recording sites V1 and PFC, we estimated the trans-
fer entropy [10] in both directions of possible interactions, PFC ! V1 and V1 ! PFC. To
investigate local information processing within each recording site, we estimated active infor-
mation storage (AIS) [19] as a measure of predictable information, and we estimated differen-
tial entropy (H) [48] as a measure of information available locally. We will now explain the
applied measures and estimators in more detail, before we describe how these estimators were
applied to data from electrophysiological recordings in the next section. To mathematically
formalize the estimation procedure from these data, we assume that neural time series
recorded from two systems X and Y (e.g. cortical sites) can be treated as collections of realiza-
tions xt and yt of random variables Xt, Yt of two random processes X = {X1, . . ., Xt, . . ., XN} and
Y = {Y1, . . ., Yt, . . ., YN}. The index t here indicates samples in time, measured in units of the
dwell time (inverse sampling rate) of the recording.
Transfer entropy.
Transfer entropy [10, 22, 49] is defined as the mutual information
between the future of a process Y and the past of a second process X, conditional on the past of
Y. Transfer entropy thus quantifies the information we obtain about the future of Y from the
past of X, taking into account information from the past of Y. Taking this past of Y into
account here removes information redundantly available in the past of both X and Y, and
reveals information provided synergistically by them [50]. In this study, we used an improved
estimator of transfer entropy presented in [15], which accounts for arbitrary information
transfer delays:

where I is the conditional mutual information (or the differential conditional mutual informa-

value of random process Y, and XdX

that form a delay embedding of length dY [51], and that render the future of the random pro-
cess conditionally independent of all variables of the random process that are further back in
time than the variables forming the state. Parameters τ and d denote the embedding delay and
embedding dimension and can be found through optimization of a local predictor as proposed
in [21] (see next section on the estimation of information theoretic measures). Past states con-
structed in this manner are then maximally informative about the present variable of the target
process, Yt, which is an important prerequisite for the correct estimation of transfer entropy
(see also [15]).
In our estimator (Eq 1), the variable u describes the assumed information transfer delay
between the processes X and Y, which accounts for a physical delay δX,Y � 1 [15]. The estima-
tor thus accommodates arbitrary physical delays between processes. The true delay δX,Y must
be recovered by ‘scanning’ various assumed delays and keeping the delay that maximizes

where Y again is a random process with present value Yt and past state Y

thus quantifies the amount of predictable information in a process or the information that is
currently in use for the next state update [19]. AIS is low in processes that produce little infor-
mation or are highly unpredictable, e.g., fully stochastic processes, whereas AIS is highest for
processes that visit many equi-probable states in a predictable sequence, i.e., without branch-
ing. In other words, AIS is high for processes with “rich dynamics” that are predictable from
the processes’ past [52]. A reference implementation of AIS can be found in the Java Informa-
tion Dynamics Toolkit (JIDT) [53]. As for TESPO estimation, an optimal delay embedding Y

may be found through optimization of the local predictor proposed in [21].

where f(Yt) is the probability density function of Yt over the support Y. Entropy quantifies the
average information contained in a signal. Based on the differential entropy the corresponding
measures for mutual and conditional mutual information and, thereby, active information
storage and transfer entropy can be defined.
Entropy as an upper bound on information transfer
The transfer entropy from Eq 1 can be rewritten as:

By dropping the negative term on the right hand side we obtain an upper bound (as already
noticed by [54, P. 65]), and by realizing that a conditional entropy is always smaller than the
corresponding unconditional one, we arrive at
TESPOðX ! Y; t; uÞ � HðXdX
t� uÞ
ð8Þ
This indicates that the overall entropy of the source states is an upper bound. Several interest-
ing other bounds on information transfer exist as detailed in [54], yet these are considerably
harder to interpret and were not the focus of the current presentation.
Estimation of information theoretic measures
In this section we will describe how the information theoretic measures presented in the last
section may be estimated from neural data. In doing so, we will also describe the methodologi-
cal pitfalls mentioned in the introduction in more detail and we will describe how these were

 handled here. If not stated otherwise, we used implementations of all presented methods in the
open source toolboxes TRENTOOL [23] and JIDT [53], called through custom MATLAB1
scripts (MATLAB 8.0, The MathWorks1 Inc., Natick, MA, 2012). Time series were normal-
ized to zero mean and unit variance before estimation.
Estimating information theoretic measures from continuous data. Estimation of infor-
mation theoretic measures from continuous data is often handled by simply discretizing the
data. This is done either by binning or the use of symbolic time series—mapping the continu-
ous data onto a finite alphabet. Specifically, the use of symbolic time series for transfer entropy
estimation was first introduced by [55] and maps the continuous values in past state vectors
with length d (Eq 2) onto a set of rank vectors. Hence, the continuous-valued time series is
mapped onto an alphabet of finite size d!. After binning or transformation to rank vectors
transfer entropy and the other information theoretic measures can then be estimated using
plug-in estimators for discrete data, which simply evaluate the relative frequency of occur-
rences of symbols in the alphabet. Discretizing the data therefore greatly simplifies the estima-
tion of transfer entropy from neural data, and may even be necessary for very small data sets.
Yet, binning ignores the neighborhood relations in the continuous data and the use of sym-
bolic times series destroys important information on the absolute values in the data. An exam-
ple where transfer entropy estimation fails due to the use of symbolic time series is reported in
[56] and discussed in [15]: In this example, information transfer between two coupled logistic
maps was not detected by symbolic transfer entropy [56]; only when estimating TESPO directly
using an estimator for continuous data, the information transfer was identified correctly [15].
To circumvent the problems with binned or symbolic time series, we here used a nearest-
neighbor based TESPO-estimator for continuous data, the Kraskov-Sto
¨gbauer-Grassberger
(KSG) estimator for mutual information described in [57]. At present, this estimator has the
most favorable bias properties compared to similar estimators for continuous data. The KSG-
estimator leads to the following expression for the estimation of TESPO as introduced in Eq 1
[22, 58]:

where ψ denotes the digamma function, k is the number of neighbors in the highest-dimen-
sional space spanned by variables Yt, Y

t� 1, XdX
t� u, and is used to determine search radii for the
lower dimensional subspaces; n� are the number of neighbors within these search radii for each
point in the lower dimensional search spaces spanned by the variable indicated in the sub-
script. Angle brackets indicate the average over realizations r (e.g. observations made over an
ensemble of copies of the systems or observations made over time in case of stationarity,
which we assumed here). We used a k of 4 as recommended by Kraskov [59, p. 23], such as to
balance the estimator’s bias—which decreases for larger k—and variance—which increases for
larger k (see also [60] for similar recommendations based on simulation studies). For a detailed
derivation of TESPO-estimation using the KSG-estimator see [22, 57, 58].
The KSG-estimator comes with a bias that is not analytically tractable [59], hence, estimates
can not be interpreted at face value, but have to be tested for their statistical significance
against the null-hypothesis of no information transfer [22, 23]. A suitable test distribution for
this null-hypothesis can be generated by repeatedly estimating TESPO from surrogate data. In
these surrogate data, the quantity of interest—potential transfer entropy between source and
target time series—should be destroyed while all other statistical properties of the data are pre-
served such that the estimation bias is constant between original and surrogate data. In the
present study we thus generated 500 surrogate data sets by permuting whole epochs of the

 target time series while leaving the order of source time course epochs unchanged (see [61] for
a detailed account of surrogate testing).
We used the ensemble-method for transfer entropy estimation [61], implemented in
TRENTOOL [23]. The ensemble method allows to pool data over epochs, which maximizes
the amount of data entering the estimation, while providing an efficient implementation of
this estimation procedure using graphics processing units (GPU). We tested the statistical sig-
nificance of TESPO in both directions of interaction in the iso 0.0% condition. We only tested
this condition, because TESPO was expected to be reduced for higher isoflurane levels based on
the results of existing studies. Because the estimation of TESPO is computationally heavy, we
used a random subset of 50 epochs to reduce the running time of this statistical test (see sup-
porting information S1 Text and S7 Table for theoretical and practical running times of the
used estimators). We first tested TESPO estimates for their significance within individual
recording sessions against 500 surrogate data sets, and then used a binomial test to establish
the statistical significance over recordings. We used a one-sided Binomial test under the null
hypothesis of no significant TESPO estimates, where individual estimates l were assumed to
be B(l, p0, n)-distributed, with p0 = 0.05 and n = 5 for animal 1 and p0 = 0.05 and n = 8 for ani-
mal 2.
As the KSG-estimator used for estimating TESPO (Eq 9) is an estimator of mutual informa-
tion it can also be used for the estimation of AIS:
AISðYÞ
¼ IðYt : Y
dY
t� 1Þ
¼ cðkÞ � 1=k þ cðNÞ � hcðnytÞ þ cðnydY
t� 1Þir;
ð10Þ
where again ψ denotes the digamma function, k is the number of neighbors in the highest-
dimensional space, N is the number of realizations, and n� denotes the number of neighbors
for each point in the respective search space. Again, we chose k = 4 for the estimation of AIS
(see above). Note that the sampling rate has an effect on the estimated absolute values of AIS
(a simulation of the effect of sampling on AIS estimates are shown as supporting information
S1 Fig)—however, qualitative results are not influenced by the choice of sampling rate; in
other words, relative differences between estimates are the same for different choices of sam-
pling rates. As a consequence, for AIS estimation the sampling rate should be constant over
data sets if the aim is to compare these estimates.
A conceptual predecessor of the KSG-estimator for mutual information is the Kozachenko-
Leonenko (KL) estimator for differential entropies [62]. The KL-estimator also allows for the
estimation of H from continuous data and reads

ð11Þ
where �(i) is twice the distance from data point i to its k-th nearest neighbor in the search
space spanned by all points.
Bayesian estimators for discretized data.
For Bayesian estimation we converted the con-
tinuous LFP time series to discrete data by applying voltage bins as follows: The voltages ±3
standard deviations around the mean of the LFP were subdivided into N equally spaced bins.
We added two additional bins containing all the values that were either smaller or larger than
the 3 SD region, amounting to a total number of bins Nbins = N + 2. We then calculated H, AIS
and TESPO for the discrete data. For AIS and TESPO estimation states were defined using the
same dimension d and τ as for the KSG-estimator, optimized using the Ragwitz criterion. We
decomposed TESPO into four entropies (Eq 9), and AIS into three entropies, which we then

 estimated individually [63]. To reduce the bias introduced by the limited number of observed
states, we used the NSB-estimator by Nemenman, Shafee, and Bialek [17], which is based on
the construction of an almost uniform prior over the expected entropy using a mixture of sym-
metric Dirichlet priors Pb. The estimator has been shown to be unbiased for a broad class of
distributions that are typical in Pb [18].
We further applied the recently proposed estimator by Archer et al. [20] that uses a prior
over distributions with infinite support based on Pitman-Yor-processes. In contrast to the
NSB prior, this prior also accounts for heavy-tailed distributions that one encounters fre-
quently in neuronal systems and does not require knowledge of the support of the
distribution.
When estimating entropies for the embedding dimensions used here, the number of possi-
ble states or “words” is between K = 1214 and K = 1231. This is much larger than the typical
number of observed states per recording of around N = 5 � 105. As a consequence, a precise
estimation of entropies is only possible if the distribution is sparse, i.e. most words have van-
ishing probability. In this case, however, the estimates should be independent of the choice of
support K as long as K is sufficiently large and does not omit states of finite probability. We
chose K0 = 1012 for the results shown in this paper, which allowed a robust computation of the
NSB estimator instead of the maximum support K that results from simple combinatorics.
Finding optimal embedding parameters.
The second methodological problem raised in
the introduction was the choice of embedding parameters for transfer entropy estimation. One
important parameter here is the choice of the total signal history when constructing past states
for source and target signal (see Eqs 1 and 2). Failure to properly account for signal histories
may lead to a variety of errors, such as underestimating transfer entropy, failure to detect
transfer entropy altogether, or the detection of spurious transfer entropy. Transfer entropy is
underestimated or missed if the past state of the source time series does not cover all the rele-
vant history, i.e., the source is under-embedded. In contrast, spurious transfer entropy may be
detected if the past state of the target time series is under-embedded, such that spurious detec-
tion of transfer entropy is a false positive and therefore the most serious error. One scenario
where spurious transfer entropy results from under-embedding is shown in Fig 10.
The choice of an optimal embedding is also relevant for the estimation of AIS, where
under-embedding leads to underestimation of the true AIS. Note that on the other hand, we
can not increase the embedding length to arbitrarily high values because this leads to computa-
tionally intractable problem sizes and requires exponentially more data for estimation.
Optimal embedding parameters d and τ may be found through the optimization of a local
predictor proposed by Ragwitz [21]. Ragwitz’ criterion tests different combinations of a range
of values for d and τ. The current combination is used to embed each point in a time series,
then, the future state for each point is predicted from the future states of its neighbors. The
parameter combination that leads to the best prediction on average is used as the optimal
embedding. To determine the neighbors of a point, we used a k-nearest-neighbor search with
k = 4, i.e., the same value for k as was used for k-nearest-neighbor searches when estimating
information-theoretic measures. We minimized the mean squared error when optimizing
Ragwitz’ local predictor. Further details on Ragwitz’ criterion can be found in the documenta-
tions of the TRENTOOL [23] and JIDT [53] toolbox.
Other approaches for embedding parameter optimization have been proposed, see for
example non-uniform embedding using mutual information to determine all relevant past
samples as proposed by [64].
Reconstruction of information transfer delays. The third methodological problem
raised in the introduction was failure to account for a physical delay δ between neural sites
Breakdown of local information processing may underlie isoflurane anesthesia effects
PLOS Computational Biology | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005511

 when estimating transfer entropy. In our estimator TESPO (Eq 9) we account for δ by introduc-
ing the parameter u. The delay u needs to be optimized to correctly estimate TESPO. If u is not
optimal, i.e., u is not sufficiently close to δ (Fig 5 and [15]), information transfer may be under-
estimated or not measured at all. This is because choosing the parameter u too large (u � δ)
means that the information present in the evaluated samples of the source is also present in the
history of the target already, and conditioned away. In contrast, choosing the parameter u too
small means that the information of the evaluated samples of the source will only arrive in the
future of the current target sample, and is useless for providing information about it (Fig 5A).
It can be proven for bivariate systems that TESPO becomes maximal when the true delay δ is
chosen for u [15]. Therefore, the true delay δ—and thus an optimal choice for u—can be
found by using the value for u that maximizes TESPO [15]. This optimal u can be found by
scanning a range of assumed values. In the present study, we scanned values ranging from 0 to
20 ms. (Note that assumed values should be physiologically plausible to keep the computations
practically feasible.)
Accounting for the information transfer δ by finding optimal parameters u for TESPO esti-
mation has important consequences when calculating indices from estimated TESPO, such as
TEnet:

 or variations of this measure. The TEnet is popular in anesthesia research [7, 9] and indicates
the predominant direction of information transfer between two bidirectionally coupled pro-
cesses X and Y (TEnet � 0 if TESPO(X ! Y, t, uX ! Y) � TESPO(Y ! X, t, uY ! X) and TEnet < 0
if TESPO(Y ! X, t, uY ! X) > TESPO(X ! Y, t, uX ! Y)). However, if values for uX ! Y and
uY ! X are not optimized individually, TEnet may take on arbitrary signs: In Fig 5B, we show a
toy example of two coupled Lorenz systems [15], where the absolute difference between raw
TESPO values changes as a function of a common u for both directions and where the difference
even changes signs for values u > 65. To obtain a meaningful value from TEnet we thus need to
find the individually optimal choices of u for both directions of transfer—in the example, these
optima are found at uX ! Y = 46 and uY ! X = 76, leading to the “true” difference.
Simulating the effect of filtering on information transfer delay reconstruction.
To sim-
ulate the effects of filtering as a preprocessing technique on the ability of the TESPO estimator
to reconstruct the correct information transfer delay, we simulated two coupled time series,
for which we estimated transfer entropy before filtering and after band-pass filtering with dif-
ferent bandwidths. The simulation was repeated 50 times.
We simulated two time series with 100,000 samples each, which were drawn from a uni-
form random distribution over the open interval (0, 1). We introduced a coupling between the
time series by adding a scaled version (factor 0.2) of the first time series to the second with a
delay of 10 samples. We estimated TESPO from the first to the second time series using the
KSG-estimator implemented in the JIDT toolbox, with k = 4 and a history of one sample for
both source and target.
We estimated TESPO with and without band-pass filtering the data for different values of u,
ranging from 1 to 20 samples. We filtered the data using a fourth order, causal Butterworth fil-
ter, implemented in the MATLAB toolbox FieldTrip [26]. We filtered the data using four dif-
ferent bandwidths: from 0.1 to 300 Hz (corresponding to the filtering done in this study), from
0.1 to 200 Hz, from 12 to 30 Hz (corresponding to the beta frequency range), and from 4 to

To test for statistically relevant effects of isoflurane levels and direction of interaction or record-
ing site on estimated measures, we performed two-factorial permutation analyses of variance
(pANOVA) for each animal and estimated measure [39, 65–67]. We used a MATLAB1 imple-
mentation of the test described in [67], which is compatible with the FieldTrip toolbox data for-
mat [26] and is available from [68].
The permutation ANOVA can be used if the normality assumptions of parametric ANOVA
are violated or—as in the present study—if assumptions are not testable due to too few data
points per factor level. The permutation ANOVA evaluates the significance of the main effect of
individual factors or their interaction effect under the null-hypothesis of no experimental effect
at all. The significance is evaluated by calculating a F-ratio for the effect from the original data;
this original F-ratio is then compared against a distribution of F-ratios obtained from permuted
data. The F-ratio’s p-value is calculated as the fraction of ratios obtained from permuted data
that is bigger than the original F-ratio. When permuting data, it is crucial to only permute data
in such a way that the currently investigated effect is destroyed while all other effects are kept
intact [65]: for example, consider a two-factorial design with factors A and B—if the main effect
of factor A is to be tested, the assignment of levels of A to data points has to be permuted; yet,
the permutation of levels of A can only happen within levels of factor B such as to not simulta-
neously destroy the effect of factor B. Thus, when testing for the effect of one factor, the effect of
all other factors is preserved, making sure that variability due to one factor is tested for while

 the variability due to the other factor is held constant. However, this permutation scheme is not
applicable to the interaction effect because it leaves no possible permutations—destroying the
interaction effect through permutation always also destroys the main effects of individual fac-
tors. Here, both factors have to be permuted, which yields an approximative test of the interac-
tion effect (see [67] for a discussion of permutation strategies and simulations).
The factors in the permutation ANOVA were isoflurane level and direction for TESPO esti-
mates, and isoflurane level and recording site for AIS and H estimates. The number of permuta-
tions was set to 10,000. In the present study, data was recorded in different sessions and
segmented into epochs. As a result, estimates for individual epochs should not be pooled over
recordings for statistical analysis (see for example [69], and also the next paragraph for a dis-
cussion). We therefore aggregated estimates over epochs to obtain one estimate per recording
session. We used the median to aggregate the estimated values for each recording session over
individual epochs, because the distribution of measures over epochs was skewed and we con-
sidered the median a more exact representation of the distributions’ central tendencies. The
aggregation of data resulted in relatively few observations per ANOVA cell and also in unequal
number of observations between cells, thus violating two basic assumptions of parametric
ANOVA (too few observations make it impossible to test for parametric assumptions like
homogeneity of variances). Therefore, we used the non-parametric permutation approach
over a parametric one, because the permutation ANOVA does not make any assumptions on
data structure.
Statistical testing using linear mixed models
As described above, LFP recordings were conducted in epochs over multiple recording ses-
sions. This introduces a so-called “nested design” [69], i.e., a hierarchical structure in the data,
where data epochs are nested within recordings, which are nested in animals. Such structures
lead to systematic errors or dependence within the data. This violates the assumption of uncor-
related errors made by the most common tests derived from the general linear model and
leads to an inflation of the type I error [69]. A measure of the degree of dependence is the
intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), which was 0.35 for ferret 1 and 0.19 for ferret 2, indi-
cating a significant dependency within the data (see [69] for a discussion of this measure).
Thus, we performed an additional statistical tests where we again tested for a significant effect
of the two factors isoflurane level and direction as well as their interaction, but we additionally
modeled the nested structure in our data by a random factor recordings. Such a model is called
a linear mixed effects model [70], and may yield higher statistical power than aggregating data
within one level of the nested design (as was done for the permutation ANOVA). We used the
following model for both animals separately:
yij ¼ b0 þ gj þ b1Di þ b2A
ð0:5Þ
i

ð1:0Þ

þ �ij;
where yij is the TESPO value from the i-th epoch in recording j, modeled as a function of isoflur-
ane level and direction of interaction, where β0 describes the model intercept, βk are the regres-
sion coefficients and describe fixed effects, γj is the random deviation of recording j from the
intercept β0, and �ij describes random noise. Di, A

Note that we used dummy coding for factor direction so that the the estimated effect β1 can be
interpreted like the simple or main effect in a standard ANOVA framework. We used contrast
coding for factor isoflurane level which allows to interpret estimated effects β2 and β3 as devia-
tions from a reference group (in this case the condition iso 0.0%). We further assume that
noise was i.i.d. and �ij � N ð0; s2
�Þ and gj � N ð0; s2
gÞ.
We used the R language [71] and the function lmer from the lme4-package [72] for
model fitting. We assessed statistical significance of individual factors by means of model com-
parison using the maximum likelihood ratio between models [73]. To allow for this model
comparison, we used maximum likelihood estimation, instead of restricted maximum likeli-
hood estimation, of random and fixed effects. To test for main effects, we compared models
including individual factors isoflurane level (fm_a) and direction (fm_d) to a Null model (fm_0)
including only the random effect; to furthermore test for an interaction effect, we compared
the model including an interaction term (fm_axb) to a model where both factors only entered
additively (fm_ab).
The models were fitted to 15,973 TESPO values from ferret 1 and 18,202 TESPO values from
ferret 2, respectively.
Simulating the effect of reduced source entropy on transfer entropy
To test whether changes in source entropy influenced the transfer entropy despite unchanged
coupling, we simulated two test cases, with high and low source entropy, respectively, while
the coupling between source and target process were held constant. To simulate the two test
cases, we randomly selected two recordings—one from the iso 0.0% condition, which on aver-
age showed higher source entropy, and one from the iso 1.0% condition, which on average
showed lower source entropy (Figs 1 and 2). In the recording from the iso 0.0% condition, we
permuted epochs in the target time series to destroy all information transfer present in the
original data. From the permuted data, we simulated two cases of artificial coupling, first,
using the high-entropy source time course from the iso 0.0% condition; and second, using the
low-entropy source time course from the iso 1.0% condition. The coupling was simulated by
adding a filtered, scaled and delayed version of the respective source time course to the target
time course for each epoch. For filtering, we used a Gaussian filter with a smoothing of 10 sam-
ples; for the scaling factor, we used a value of 0.2, which resulted in a TESPO value for the high-
entropy test case that was close to the TESPO in the iso 0.0% condition. By replacing the original
coupling in both recordings with a simulated coupling, we made sure that the coupling was
constant for both test cases.
For both test cases, we estimated TESPO and HðXdX
t� uÞ following the estimation procedures
described above. We tested differences in TESPO using a permutation independent samples
t-test with 10,000 permutations. To make sure that our simulation reflected information trans-
fer found in the original data, we further tested for a significant difference between TESPO in
the original data from the iso 0.0% recording and TESPO in the high-entropy test case (using
the source time iso 0.0% condition). Here, we found no significant difference, indicating that

 the transfer entropy in our test case did not differ significantly from the transfer entropy found
in the original data.
Correlating information-theoretic measures with other time-series
properties
We correlated TESPO, AIS, and H with more conventional measures from time-series analysis,
namely, the autocorrelation decay time (ACT), signal variance, and power in individual frequency
bands. This correlation was performed to investigate whether information-theoretic measures
captured signal properties that could be described equally well by more simple measures.
The ACT was calculated by finding the lag at which the autocorrelation coefficient
decayed below e−1. The signal variance was calculated as the variance over time for each
recording after subtracting the mean of the time series. The band power was calculated for
individual frequency bands (delta = 0.5–4 Hz, theta = 4–8 Hz, alpha = 8–12 Hz, beta = 12–30
Hz, gamma = 30–40 Hz, following [47]), using the multitaper method with discrete prolate
spheroidal sequences (Slepian sequences) as tapers (smoothing = 1 Hz) implemented in the
MATLAB toolbox FieldTrip [26].
We calculated correlations between information-theoretic measures and conventional
measures for individual isoflurane levels and recording sites or direction of interaction,
respectively. For each correlation, we pooled data over recording sessions for the respective
isoflurane level and calculated Spearman’s rank correlation. We tested the correlation for sig-
nificance using a restricted permutation test, where permutations were allowed only within
one recording, accounting for the nested experimental design (see [69] and section Statistical
testing using linear mixed models, below). Additionally, we calculated the correlation as well
as the variance explained, R2, for individual recordings, because calculating R2 for the coeffi-
cient calculated from pooled data does not yield interpretable results.

absolute estimates increased for higher sampling rates; the number of data points was held
approximately constant by selecting a subset of trials for estimation such that the number of
