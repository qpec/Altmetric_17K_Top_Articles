Abstract
Recent genetic studies have identified some alleles associated with higher BMI but lower risk of 
type 2 diabetes, hypertension and heart disease. These “favorable adiposity” alleles are collectively 
associated with lower insulin levels and higher subcutaneous-to-visceral adipose tissue ratio and 
may protect from disease through higher adipose storage capacity. We aimed to use data from 
164,609 individuals from the UK Biobank and five other studies to replicate associations between 
a genetic score of 11 favorable adiposity variants and adiposity and risk of disease, test for

 interactions between BMI and favorable adiposity genetics and test effects separately in men and 
women.
In the UK Biobank the 50% of individuals carrying the most favorable adiposity alleles had higher 
BMIs (0.120 Kg/m2 [0.066,0.174]; p=1E-5) and higher body fat percentage (0.301 % 
[0.230,0.372]; p=1E-16) compared to the 50% of individuals carrying the fewest alleles. For a 
given BMI, the 50% of individuals carrying the most favourable adiposity alleles were at: 0.837 
OR [0.784,0.894] lower risk of type 2 diabetes (p=1E-7), -0.859 mmHg [-1.099,-0.618] lower 
systolic (p=3E-12) and -0.394 mmHg [-0.534,-0.254] lower diastolic blood pressure (p=4E-8), 
0.935 OR [0.911,0.958] lower risk of hypertension (p=1E-7) and 0.921 OR [0.872,0.973] lower 
risk of heart disease (p=3E-3). In women, these associations could be explained by the observation 
that the alleles associated with higher BMI but lower risk of disease were also associated with a 
favourable body fat distribution, with a lower waist-hip ratio (-0.004 [-0.005,-0.003] 50% vs 50%; 
p=3E-14) but in men, the favourable adiposity alleles were associated with higher waist 
circumference (0.454 cm [0.267,0.641] 50% vs 50%; p=2E-6) and higher waist-hip ratio (0.0013 
[0.0003,0.0024] 50% vs 50%; p=0.01). Results were strengthened when meta-analysing with five 
additional studies. There was no evidence of interaction between a genetic score consisting of 
known BMI variants and the favorable adiposity genetic score.
In conclusion, different molecular mechanisms that lead to higher body fat percentage (with 
greater subcutaneous storage capacity) can have different impacts on cardiometabolic disease risk. 
While higher BMI is associated with higher risk of diseases, better fat storage capacity could 
reduce the risk.
Introduction
Some obese individuals are metabolically healthy whilst some normal weight individuals 
have an elevated risk of type 2 diabetes, heart disease and hypertension (1; 2). One of the 
many factors that mean two people of similar BMI can have very different risks of 
cardiometabolic disease is the capacity of subcutaneous adipose tissue to store excess lipids. 
The “adipose tissue expandability” hypothesis states that when adipose tissue stops 
expanding by cell size or number, with continued weight gain the lipid accumulates 
preferentially in ectopic sites such as cardiac, liver and beta cells which can lead to heart 
disease, hypertension, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (3). Single gene studies of 
extreme forms of obesity and lipodystrophy, two apparently opposite conditions, support the 
“adipose tissue expandability” hypothesis (4; 5).
Studies of the general population show that most common genetic variants associated with 
higher BMI are associated with higher risk of type 2 diabetes, hypertension and heart 
disease, either individually as in the case of the variant in the FTO gene (6), or as a genetic 
risk score (7). However, recent studies have also identified common genetic variants where 
alleles associated with lower insulin resistance (8) are also associated with higher BMI and 
body fat percentage and lower risk of type 2 diabetes, hypertension and heart disease (9–11). 
These variants include those in the IRS1 gene, where the common allele associated with 
higher body fat percentage is associated with lower fasting insulin, triglyceride and LDL-
cholesterol levels, lower insulin secretion and higher insulin sensitivity, adiponectin, HDL-

 cholesterol and leptin levels (9). A genetic score of ten (11) or eleven (10) alleles including 
that near IRS1 had a similar profile with the alleles associated with higher BMI also being 
associated with lower circulating levels of triglyceride and fatty liver markers but higher 
adiponectin, HDL-cholesterol and SHBG levels and lower risk of type 2 diabetes, 
hypertension and heart disease. These “favorable adiposity” alleles were also associated 
collectively with a higher subcutaneous-to-visceral adipose tissue ratio (10) and higher body 
fat mass (11), and may protect from disease by increasing the capacity of subcutaneous 
adipose tissue to store excess calories as lipids (10). These observations suggest that 
different molecular mechanisms that lead to higher BMI and higher body fat percentage can 
have different impacts on metabolic disease, some of which are paradoxical to 
epidemiological correlations.
In this study we had three aims. First, to replicate the association of a genetic score of 11 
favorable adiposity variants (10) with higher BMI and body fat percentage, but lower risk of 
the three diseases of the “metabolic syndrome” - type 2 diabetes, hypertension and heart 
disease. Given the apparently paradoxical associations between higher BMI and lower risk 
of disease we wanted to replicate the effects in large studies not part of previous genome 
wide association study meta-analyses to both confirm associations and establish their true 
effects in population-based studies. Second, to test if a genetic score of favorable adiposity 
variants interacted with a genetic score of variants identified as associated primarily with 
BMI. Identifying interactions between genetic variants has proven very difficult, but the 
availability of individual level data in the UK Biobank provides an opportunity to identify 
individuals who may be at especially high or low genetic risk of disease if they carry certain 
combinations of alleles. These BMI variants consisted of those recently identified as 
associated with BMI in a meta-analysis of 250,000 individuals (12). Third, we aimed to test 
the role of the favorable adiposity alleles in disease predisposition in men and women 
separately given the differences in body fat distribution between the two sexes. We used the 
UK Biobank study to address these questions because it is a single large relatively 
homogeneous population based study. We used five additional studies not part of previous 
GWA studies to provide additional statistical confidence of our findings.
Methods
Study samples
All details of the UK Biobank and 5 additional studies are given in table S1.
The UK Biobank—The UK Biobank recruited over 500,000 individuals aged 37-73 years 
(99.5% were between 40 and 69 years) in 2006-2010 from across the UK. Participants 
provided a range of information via questionnaires and interviews (e.g. demographics, health 
status, lifestyle) and anthropometric measurements, blood pressure readings, blood, urine 
and saliva samples were taken for future analysis; this has been described in more detail 
elsewhere (13). We used 120,286 individuals of British descent from the initial UK Biobank 
dataset. We did not include other ethnic groups, because individually they were 
underpowered to detect previously reported effects. British-descent was defined as 
individuals who both self-identified as white British and were confirmed as ancestrally

 Caucasian using principal components analyses (PCA) of genome wide genetic information. 
This dataset underwent extensive central quality control including the exclusion of the 
majority of third degree or closer relatives from a genetic kinship analysis of 96% of 
individuals. We performed an additional round of principal components analysis (PCA) on 
these 120,286 UK Biobank participants. We selected 95,535 independent SNPs (pairwise r2 
<0.1) directly genotyped with a minor allele frequency (MAF) ≥ 2.5% and missingness 
<1.5% across all UK Biobank participants with genetic data available at the time of this 
study (N=152,732), and with HWE P>1x10-6 within the white British participants. Principal 
components were subsequently generated using FlashPCA (14).
Additional studies—To provide further evidence for the role of favorable adiposity 
alleles we used a total of 50,753 individuals from 5 studies: EXTEND (6,504 individuals of 
white European descent collected from South West England), GoDARTS (4086 individuals 
of white European descent collected from North Scotland) (15), Generation Scotland: 
Scottish Family Health Study (14,064 individuals of white European descent collected from 
Scotland) (16), PROSPER (5,244 individuals of white European descent collected from 
Scotland, Ireland and the Netherlands) (17; 18) and EPIC-Norfolk (20,855 individuals of 
white European descent collected from Norfolk) (19). We chose these studies because they 
were not part of the published GWAS used in previous studies (10).
Phenotypes
Measures of adiposity
The UK Biobank: We used BMI and bio-impedance measures of body fat percentage 
measured by the Tanita BC418MA body composition analyser.
We used body fat percentage as it is a more accurate measure of body composition. The UK 
Biobank provided two measures of BMI – one calculated from weight(kg)/height(m)2 and 
one using height and electrical impedance to quantify mass. We excluded individuals 
(N=1,172 out of 500,000) with differences >4.56 SDs between impedance and normal BMI 
measures where both variables were available (94% of data). If only one measure of BMI 
was available this was used (N=7,290).
Additional studies: We used BMI and body fat percentage as measures of adiposity. Body 
fat percentage was measured using Tanita digital scale in EXTEND, bio-impedance on a 
Tanita digital scale in Generation Scotland and Tanita digital scale in EPIC-Norfolk.
Measures of disease and disease related traits
The UK Biobank: We used 3 cardiometabolic disease outcomes: type 2 diabetes, 
hypertension (also represented by continuous measures of systolic and diastolic blood 
pressure) and heart disease – all using baseline data and following similar definitions to 
those used in previous genome wide association studies.
We defined type 2 diabetes using baseline data and following similar definitions to those 
used in previous genome wide association studies. We defined type 2 diabetes cases if 3 
criteria were present: i) reports of either type 2 diabetes or generic diabetes at the interview,

 ii) at least one year gap from diagnosis without requiring insulin iii) reported age at 
diagnosis over the age of 35 years to limit the numbers of individuals with slow-progressing 
autoimmune diabetes or monogenic forms. Individuals not reporting an age of diagnosis 
were excluded. We also excluded individuals diagnosed with diabetes within the year prior 
to the baseline study visit as we were unable to determine whether they were using insulin 
within the first year. Controls were individuals not fulfilling these criteria.
We defined hypertensive cases as individuals with systolic blood pressure of >140 mmHg, or 
a diastolic blood pressure of >90 mmHg, or the report of blood pressure medication usage. 
Controls were individuals not fulfilling these criteria. For the analysis of systolic and 
diastolic blood pressure, we corrected blood pressure measures in people on 
antihypertensive drugs by adding 15 mmHg to systolic and 10 mmHg to diastolic blood 
pressure, in keeping with the approach taken by genome wide association studies. As a 
sensitivity analysis, we used blood pressure measures in individuals who were not on blood 
pressure medications.
We defined heart disease cases if individuals reported angina and/or a heart attack at the 
interview stage. We defined Controls as individuals without these conditions. As a 
sensitivity analysis, we used heart disease cases as only those with heart attack at the 
interview stage.
Additional studies: We used 3 metabolic disease outcomes: type 2 diabetes, hypertension 
(also represented by continuous measures of systolic and diastolic blood pressure) and heart 
disease.
EXTEND defined type 2 diabetes as self-reported or having HbA1c >6.4% and excluded in 
case subjects, 1) individuals aged at diagnosis <35 or >70 years; 2) individuals who needed 
insulin treatment within 1 year of diagnosis; and 3) individuals aged <45 years whose age at 
diagnosis was not known at the time of study; and in control subjects, 1) individuals aged 
<35 or >70 years at the time of study; and 2) individuals with HbA1c >6.4%. Hypertension 
and heart disease were self-reported.
GoDARTS defined Diabetes as status at recruitment (case/control). Hypertensive cases were 
defined as individuals with systolic blood pressure of >140 mmHg, or a diastolic blood 
pressure of > 90 mmHg at recruitment. Blood pressure was corrected by adding 15 mmHg to 
systolic and 10 mmHg to diastolic blood pressure in hypertensive cases if they were on 
blood pressure medications.
Generation Scotland defined Diabetes cases by identifying linkage to prescribing data where 
drugs prescribed were in BNF code group 6.1. The prescriptions were also used to show 
which participants were taking blood pressure lowering drugs (BNF code 2.4, 2.5, 2.6). 
Blood pressure was measured twice during a clinic visit and the mean systolic and diastolic 
values used. Diabetes, hypertension and heart disease were self-reported on a questionnaire 
at the time of participation.
PROSPER defined type 2 diabetes by (i) known type 2 diabetes, and/or (ii) fasting glucose 
>=7mmol/L, and/or (iii) use of antidiabetic drugs (any oral hypoglycaemic agent or insulin).

 Hypertensive cases were defined as those on use of antihypertensive medication. They 
defined heart disease as combination of prevalent (baseline history of myocardial infarction, 
CABG/PTCA, angina) and incident (coronary heart disease death (definite plus suspect), 
non-fatal myocardial infarction (definite plus suspect), CABG/PTCA) events. All endpoints 
were validated by a blinded events committee. For detailed end point definitions, please see 
appendix B in (18).
EPIC-Norfolk used both prevalent and incident type 2 diabetes to define type 2 diabetes 
cases. They used treatment-adjusted variables for systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and 
blood pressure medication to define hypertension. They defined heart disease as self-
reported myocardial infarction at baseline and incident myocardial infarction.
Selection of Genetic variants associated with favorable adiposity—We chose 11 
variants previously identified by a hierarchical clustering approach as sharing features of 
monogenic lipodystrophic insulin resistance, including a surrogate measure of insulin 
resistance, subcutaneous to visceral adipose tissue ratio from CT scans, lipids, markers of 
fatty liver disease, and adiponectin (table S2) (10). We refer to the BMI raising alleles as 
“favorable adiposity” alleles throughout the manuscript.
Selection of Genetic variants associated with BMI—We selected 69 variants as 
associated with BMI and refer to the BMI raising alleles as “BMI” alleles throughout the 
manuscript. These 69 were selected from 76 common genetic variants associated with BMI 
at genome wide significance in the Genetic Investigation of ANthropometric Traits (GIANT) 
consortium studies of up to 339,224 individuals (table S3) (12). We limited the BMI SNPs to 
those that were associated with BMI in the analysis of all European ancestry individuals and 
did not include those that only reached genome-wide levels of statistical confidence in one-
sex only, or one-strata only. Variants were also excluded if classified as a secondary signal 
within a locus. Three SNPs were excluded due to potential pleiotropy (rs11030104 (BDNF 
reward phenotypes), rs13107325 (SLC39A8 lipids, blood pressure), rs3888190 (SH2B1 
multiple traits)), 3 SNPs were not in Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) (rs17001654, 
rs2075650, rs9925964) and one SNP was unavailable (rs2033529) (table S3).
Genotypes
The UK Biobank—We extracted genotypes from UK Biobank’s imputation dataset and 
used genotype dosage values prior to association testing. Individual genotypes were 
excluded if HWE P<E-6 or if imputation quality <0.9. We confirmed that the 11 favorable 
adiposity variants and the 69 BMI variants were imputed with high quality by comparing to 
the directly genotyped data, available in 120,286 UK Biobank individuals of genetically 
confirmed British ancestry. Details of imputation quality are given in tables S2 and S3.
Additional studies—Table S4 describes the imputation/genotyping methods used by each 
study.

 Genetic score analysis
We constructed 2 genetic scores: (i) the genetic score of 11 favorable adiposity variants was 
the number of favorable adiposity alleles carried by each individual weighted based on their 
effect on fasting insulin, (ii) the genetic score of 69 BMI variants was the number of alleles 
associated with higher BMI carried by each individual. As a sensitivity analysis, we 
conducted a genetic score of favorable adiposity based on variants that were individually 
associated with body fat percentage in the UK Biobank study.
Statistical analysis
For the analysis of individual variants we assumed an additive model. We used 5 covariates 
including age, sex, genotyping platform (two were used), study centre and five within UK 
genetic principle components. As smoking has a big effect on BMI, we ran a sensitivity 
analysis using smoking as a covariate in the UK Biobank data in addition to the above 
covariates.
We used the genetic risk score for BMI in order to test the hypothesis that a general genetic 
predisposition to higher BMI interacted with a general predisposition to favorable adiposity. 
We did not investigate specific variants for interaction. For this interaction analysis between 
two genetic scores (69 BMI variants and 11 favorable adiposity variants) and measures of 
blood pressure and cardiometabolic disease risk, we included the respective interaction 
terms in the models (e.g. interaction term = BMI genetic score x favorable adiposity genetic 
score.
Meta-analysis
We meta-analysed results across the 6 studies using fixed-effects inverse variance-weighted 
meta-analysis. We tested for any evidence of heterogeneity between the results using the 
Cochran Q test.
Sex dichotomized analysis
To assess whether or not associations differed between sexes, we repeated the inverse-
variance meta-analyses in men and women separately in the UK Biobank study. Sex-
difference P values were calculated by the Cochran Q test.
Assessing disease risk in individuals with a genetic susceptibility to high BMI
To provide additional context for the interaction analysis, we dichotomized the 11 favorable 
adiposity genetic score and the BMI genetic score into two groups based on the median of 
the two genetic score distributions. We considered individuals with above median favorable 
adiposity genetic score and below median BMI genetic score as having the lowest 
cardiometabolic disease risk and used them as a reference group. By comparing to the 
reference group, we tested blood pressure and the risk of type 2 diabetes, hypertension and 
heart disease in 3 groups of individuals based on the two genetic score distributions: i) those 
at below median of the favorable adiposity genetic score and below median of the BMI 
genetic score, ii) those at above median of the favorable adiposity genetic score and above

 median of the BMI genetic score, and iii) those at below median of the favorable adiposity 
genetic score and above median of the BMI genetic score.
Results
A genetic score of 11 favorable adiposity variants was associated with higher BMI and 
body fat percentage in the UK Biobank
The genetic score of 11 favorable adiposity variants was associated with higher body fat 
percentage and higher BMI in the UK Biobank with very high levels of statistical 
confidence. Each additional favourable adiposity weighted allele was associated with a 
0.126% ([0.104,0.149]; p=8E-28) higher fat percentage and 0.046 Kg/m2 ([0.029,0.063]; 
p=2E-7) higher BMI. These effects meant that the 50% of people carrying the most 
favourable adiposity alleles had on average 0.301 % ([0.230,0.372]; p=1E-16) additional 
adipose tissue and were 0.120 Kg/m2 ([0.066,0.174]; p=1E-5) heavier than the 50% of 
people carrying the fewest favourable adiposity alleles (figure 1a). The 11 variants in a 
multivariable analysis explained 0.04% variance in BMI levels and 0.2% variance in body 
fat percentage in the UK Biobank study (N=119,688) after correcting for age, sex, 
genotyping array, study centre and within UK principle components. The analysis of the 
favorable adiposity genetic score against absolute measures of body fat mass and body fat-
free mass showed that the effect of the 11 favorable adiposity variants was driven by fat-
mass not fat-free mass and the genetic score was not associated with height (figure 1a; table 
1). The genetic score effects were predominantly driven by 7 of the 11 variants that were 
individually associated with body fat percentage at p<3E-5 – those in or near the LYPLAL1, 
PPARG, PEPD, GRB14, IRS1, ANKRD55 and FAM13A genes (table S5)
A genetic score of 11 favorable adiposity variants was associated with lower waist 
circumference and waist-hip ratio in women, but higher waist circumference and waist hip 
ratio in men
In the UK Biobank, the genetic score of 11 favorable adiposity variants associated with 
higher BMI was associated with a favourable body fat distribution, as measured by a lower 
waist-hip ratio (-0.0006 [-0.0009, -0.0004] per allele; p=2E-7) but these effects were 
dichotomised by sex. In women, the alleles associated with higher BMI were also associated 
with a lower waist-hip ratio (-0.0017 [-0.0021, -0.0014] per allele; p=9E-23), an effect 
driven by a larger hip circumference (0.16 [0.11, 0.21] per allele; p=1E-9), with little effect 
on waist circumference (-0.04 [-0.10, 0.02] per allele; p=0.2). In men, the favourable 
adiposity genetic risk score associated with higher BMI was associated with higher waist 
circumference (0.17 [0.11, 0.23] per allele; p=1E-8), higher hip circumference (0.12 [0.08, 
0.16] per allele; p=1E-8) and slightly higher waist-hip ratio (0.0005 [0.0002, 0.0009] per 
allele; p=0.001) (table S6). These effects meant that the 50% of men carrying the most 
favourable adiposity alleles had a waist circumference 0.45 cm larger ([0.267,0.641]; 
p=2E-6) than the 50% of men carrying the fewest favourable adiposity alleles. These 
associations were consistent when meta-analysing the UK Biobank data with 3 additional 
studies (figure 2). These effects were even stronger when limiting the favorable adiposity 
genetic score to the 7 variants that were individually associated with body fat percentage at

 p<3E-5 – those in or near the LYPLAL1, PPARG, PEPD, GRB14, IRS1, ANKRD55 and 
FAM13A genes (table S6).
A genetic score of 11 favorable adiposity variants was associated with lower risk of type 2 
diabetes
Despite being associated with higher fat mass, each additional favourable adiposity weighted 
allele was associated with a 0.943 OR ([0.924,0.963]; p=2E-8) lower risk of type 2 diabetes 
in the UK Biobank. This association was statistically stronger when meta-analysing the UK 
Biobank data with five additional studies (table S7). These effects meant that the 50% of 
people carrying the most favourable adiposity alleles had a 0.895 OR ([0.840,0.954]; 
p=6E-4) lower risk of type 2 diabetes than the 50% of people carrying the fewest favourable 
adiposity alleles (figure 1b; table S8). Despite the dichotomised body fat distribution, these 
effects were consistent in men and women (table S9) and across 6 different bands of BMI 
(<25,25-30,30-35,35-40 and >40; figure 3). The effect was similar when we used smoking 
as a covariate (table S10) and, as expected, was stronger when we used 7 variants that were 
individually associated with body fat percentage at p<3E-5 (table S11).
We next used the genetic score for favorable adiposity and a genetic risk score for BMI in 
order to test the hypothesis that a general genetic predisposition to higher BMI interacted 
with a general predisposition to favorable adiposity. We did not investigate specific variants 
for interaction. There was no evidence of interaction between the genetic score of favorable 
adiposity alleles and the genetic score of 69 BMI alleles (Pinteraction >0.05). Despite being 
more overweight, carrying more favorable adiposity alleles than average reduced the risk of 
type 2 diabetes in the 50% of individuals most genetically predisposed to high BMI (OR: 
0.885 [0.813,0.965]; p=0.005; figure 4; table S12). These effects were consistent with those 
expected given additive effects of the alleles.
A genetic score of 11 favorable adiposity variants was associated with lower risk of 
hypertension
Despite being associated with higher fat mass, each additional favourable adiposity weighted 
allele was associated with a 0.255 mmHg ([0.334,0.176]; p=2E-10) lower systolic blood 
pressure, 0.096 mmHg ([0.143,0.048]; p=7E-5) lower diastolic blood pressure and 0.982 OR 
([0.974,0.989]; p=3E-6) lower risk of hypertension in the UK Biobank (table 1). These 
associations were statistically stronger when meta-analysing the UK Biobank data with five 
additional studies (table S7). These effects meant that the 50% of people carrying the most 
favourable adiposity alleles had a 0.732 mmHg ([0.980,0.484]; p=7E-9) lower systolic blood 
pressure, 0.292 mmHg ([0.440,0.144]; p=1E-4) lower diastolic blood pressure and 0.946 OR 
([0.923,0.969]; p=7E-6) lower risk of hypertension than the 50% of people carrying the 
fewest favourable adiposity alleles (figure 1b; table S8). Despite the dichotomised body fat 
distribution, these effects were consistent in men and women (table S9) and across 6 
different bands of BMI (<25,25-30,30-35,35-40 and >40; figure 3). These effects were 
similar when we used smoking as a covariate or when we excluded individuals on blood 
pressure medication (table S10). As expected, the effects were stronger when we used 7 
variants that were individually associated with body fat percentage at p<3E-5 (table S11).

 There was no evidence of interaction between the genetic score of favorable adiposity alleles 
and the genetic score of 69 BMI alleles on systolic or diastolic blood pressure or the risk of 
hypertension (Pinteraction = 0.1, 0.07 and 0.7 respectively). Despite being more overweight, 
carrying more favorable adiposity alleles than average reduced the risk of hypertension in 
the 50% of individuals most genetically predisposed to high BMI (OR: 0.960 [0.927,0.994]; 
p=0.02) and lowered their average systolic blood pressure (-0.475 [-0.829,-0.121]; p=0.009) 
but had no detectable effect on diastolic blood pressure (figure 4; table S12). These effects 
were consistent with those expected given additive effects of the alleles.
A Genetic score of 11 favorable adiposity variants was associated with lower risk of heart 
disease
Despite being associated with higher fat mass, each additional favourable adiposity weighted 
allele was associated with a 0.967 OR ([0.950,0.984]; p=1E-4) lower risk of heart disease in 
the UK Biobank (table 1). This association was consistent when meta-analysing the UK 
Biobank data with five additional studies (table S7). Based on the UK Biobank study, these 
effects meant that the 50% of people carrying the most favourable adiposity alleles had a 
0.942 OR ([0.892,0.994]; p=0.03) lower risk of heart disease (figure 1b; table S8). Despite 
the dichotomised body fat distribution, these effects were consistent in men and women, 
although they did not reach p<0.05 in women, where there were fewer heart disease cases 
(table S8) These effects were similar when we used smoking as a covariate or when we 
considered only individuals with the history of heart attack as cases (table S10). The effects 
were stronger when we used 7 variants that were individually associated with body fat 
percentage at p<3E-5 (table S11).
There was no evidence of interaction between the genetic score of favorable adiposity alleles 
and the genetic score of 69 BMI alleles (Pinteraction = 0.5). Carrying more favorable adiposity 
alleles than average in the genetically predisposed individuals to high BMI had no detectable 
effect on risk of heart disease (figure 4; table S12).
Effects of favourable adiposity alleles on disease increase when correcting for BMI
As expected given that the favourable adiposity genetic score is associated with higher BMI, 
when we corrected for BMI, associations with reduced disease risk strengthened (table S13). 
These results showed that, for a given BMI, the 50% of individuals carrying the most 
favourable adiposity alleles were at lower risk of type 2 diabetes (OR: 0.837 [0.784,0.894]; 
p=1E-7), hypertension (OR: 0.935 [0.911,0.958]; p=1E-7) and heart disease (OR:0.921 
[0.872,0.973]; p=0.003) and had lower blood pressure (systolic: -0.859 mmHg 
[-1.099,-0.618]; p=3E-12 and diastolic: -0.394 mmHg [-0.534,-0.254]; p=4E-8). These 
effects were consistent in men and women.
Discussion
We replicated with very high statistical confidence results from previous studies showing 
that in combination, 11 common genetic variants are associated with higher adiposity but 
lower risk of type 2 diabetes, hypertension and heart disease. In total we used 164,609 
individuals from 6 studies including the UK Biobank and included 6,735, 82,512 and 8,881

 individuals with type 2 diabetes, hypertension and heart disease, respectively. These studies 
had not contributed to previous GWA studies and so our study provides completely 
independent replication of an apparently paradoxical association – alleles associated with 
higher fat mass lower the risk of metabolic disease. Our analyses separated by sex provided 
further insight into the likely mechanisms underlying these apparently paradoxical 
associations. In women, the extra body fat conferred by the favorable adiposity genetic score 
was more likely to be in the lower body, as measured by a lower waist-hip ratio and 
especially larger hip circumference. In men however, the extra body fat conferred by the 
favorable adiposity genetic score was more likely to be in the upper body, as indicated by a 
higher waist circumference and waist-hip ratio. Data from previous studies provides some 
further explanation for the apparently paradoxical association. For example, in combination, 
the favorable adiposity alleles are associated with higher subcutaneous to visceral adipose 
ratio (10) higher insulin sensitivity, higher hip circumference, and higher gynoid and leg fat 
mass (11). This set of associations is consistent with the alleles labeled as favorable 
adiposity (or most of them) exerting their effects through a primary role in adipose tissue 
and fat storage capacity, although we cannot rule out mechanisms where insulin resistance is 
the primary starting point.
Our data replicate previous associations but provide an important advance for several 
reasons. First, we provide further evidence that the “favorable adiposity” alleles are 
associated predominantly with higher fat mass rather than any other aspect of BMI such as 
lean mass. This finding is consistent with previous studies (9–11) and important because it 
shows that the alleles associated with higher BMI are not protecting from disease through 
higher muscle mass. Instead our results confirm that the genetic score associated with lower 
disease risk is associated with higher adiposity. Second, our data of body fat mass and body 
fat percentage in 118,012 individuals indicate that the favourable adiposity effects are likely 
limited to seven of the eleven variants. Two of these variants, those in IRS1 and PPARG, are 
well known and lie near genes with a well-established role in insulin signalling and 
adipocyte differentiation respectively. Our study shows that the variants in or near 
LYPLAL1, PEPD, GRB14, ANKRD55, and FAM13A, all of which were associated with 
body fat percentage at p < 3E-5, are very strong candidates for a role in adipocyte biology, 
an interpretation consistent with the fact that two of these variants, those in LYPLAL1 and 
GRB14, were associated with waist hip ratio at genome wide significance in previous 
GWAS of waist-hip ratio (20). Third, we have quantified the effects of genetically higher 
BMI on disease in a very large population based study which means effects are relatively 
unbiased by disease ascertainment. Fourth, because we used a single very large population 
with individual level data available we were able to look for interactions between a genetic 
predisposition to higher BMI and favorable adiposity. We also found that the effects of the 
favorable adiposity variants on disease risk were similar across all bands of BMI. These 
interaction analyses, made feasible by the availability of individual level data in a single very 
large study, showed two things. First, that the favourable adiposity alleles reduce the risk of 
disease at all BMIs and at high and low genetic risk of obesity (based on alleles identified by 
the GIANT consortium). Second, that there is no evidence of a synergistic effect that means 
some individuals are at especially high or low genetic risk of adverse adiposity effects.

 Our study had a number of limitations. First we do not know which molecular pathways lead 
to a favorable adiposity phenotype although the presence of variants near the PPARG and 
IRS1 genes point to known mechanisms (21–23). Second, the 11 variants only explain a very 
small proportion of body fat percentage and disease risk. Many other factors will influence 
the difference in disease risk between two individuals of the same BMI. However, our results 
show that higher fat storage capacity is a likely mechanism that improves metabolic health in 
the general population. Third, the study of individual variants suggests that those at ARL15 
and TET2 may not represent a favorable adiposity phenotype. The final variant, that in 
RSPO3, is associated with waist-hip ratio in previous GWAS studies and in the UK biobank 
(data not shown) but not with altered BMI or fat mass – and so may represent a simple 
redistribution of the same amount of body fat. The signal at PDGFC may have a very subtle 
effect and needs further investigation. A further limitation is that we have not examined 
whether or not the variants alter adipocyte cell size or related features of adipocyte 
“function” and future studies are needed to examine features of adipocytes in tissue biopsies 
from individuals carrying many favourable adiposity alleles.
In summary, the strong association between the favorable adiposity genetic score and body 
fat percentage and lower risk of cardiometabolic diseases regardless of BMI or high genetic 
predisposition to obesity suggests that the mechanism of disease protection is an increased 
capacity to store triglyceride subcutaneously. The explanation most compatible with our 
findings is that the increased adipose storage capacity is in the lower body in women, but the 
upper body in men. Individuals who have genetically higher fat storage capacity can stay 
metabolically healthier at higher BMIs than individuals without such genetic variation, 
thereby partially explaining the concept of individual BMI thresholds to develop metabolic 
disease.
