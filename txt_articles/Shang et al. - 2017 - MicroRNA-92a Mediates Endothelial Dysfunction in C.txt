ABSTRACT
CKD is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). The accumulation of uremic toxins in CKD
induces oxidativestress andendothelial dysfunction. MicroRNA-92a (miR-92a)isinducedbyoxidativestress in
endothelial cells (ECs) and involved in angiogenesis and atherosclerosis. We investigated a role for oxidative
stress–responsive miR-92a in CKD. Our study of patients at three clinical sites showed increased serum
miR-92a level with decreased kidney function. In cultured ECs, human CKD serum or uremic toxins (such as
indoxyl sulfate),compared withnon-CKDserum, induced the levels ofmiR-92aand suppressedthe expression
ofmiR-92atargets,includingkeyendothelial-protectivemolecules.TheantioxidantN-acetylcysteineinhibited
these vasculopathic properties. In rats, adenine-induced CKD associated with increased levels of miR-92a in
aortas, serum, and CD144+ endothelial microparticles. Furthermore, CD144+ microparticles from human
uremic serum contained more miR-92a than those from control serum. Additional analysis showed a positive
correlation between serum levels of miR-92a and indoxyl sulfate in a cohort of patients with ESRD undergoing
hemodialysis. Collectively, our findings suggest that the uremic toxins accumulated in CKD can upregulate
miR-92a in ECs, which impairs EC function and predisposes patients to CVD.

 CKD is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease
(CVD). Oxidative injury resulting from accumulated uremic
toxins is likely a contributing factor.1 Protein-bound uremic
toxins, such as indoxyl sulfate (IS), hippuric acid (HA), in-
dole-3-acetic acid (IAA), and p-cresylsulfate (pCS), can
damage vascular endothelial cells (ECs), which in turn,
transform into a pro-oxidative and proinflammatory phe-
notype.1 The resulting endothelial dysfunction is manifested
by the induction of proinflammatory cytokines and suppres-
sion of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS).1 IS and
pCS have been found to associate with cardiovascular
events.2,3 Furthermore, using an oral absorbent to decrease
plasma level of IS improved flow-mediated dilation (FMD),4
a commonly used indicator of EC function. Although the
role of uremic toxins in EC dysfunction has been clearly
shown, the molecular mechanisms underlying their vasculo-
pathic effects remain elusive.
MicroRNAs (miRs) have emerged as crucial regulators
in EC function via their modulation of eNOS-derived ni-
tric oxide (NO) bioavailability, angiogenesis, and innate
immune response.5 For example, endothelial miR-126
and miR-483 are important regulators of angiogenesis
and required in endothelial repair and homeostasis.6,7 In
contrast, miR-155 promotes endothelial inflammation and
contributes to atherosclerosis.8 In addition to their intra-
cellular functions, EC-derived miRs can also be secreted
through microparticles (MPs).9 These endothelial cell–
originated MPs (EMPs), which are enriched in CD31
and/or CD144 surface markers, can mediate intercellular
communication.10 An increase in EMPs has been shown in
patients with ESRD, and exposure of rat aorta to these
EMPs impaired the NO-dependent vasodilation.11
We recently showed that miR-92a is induced by oxidative
stress in ECs,9 and others have reported that miR-92a is
involved in angiogenesis and atherosclerosis.12,13 Mecha-
nistically, miR-92a targets the 39 untranslated region of
mRNAs encoding sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), Krüppel-like factor 2
(KLF2), and KLF4, all of which positively regulate eNOS-
derived NO.9,14 By inhibiting these endothelial-protective
molecules, miR-92a can promote the endothelial innate im-
mune response and the ensuing vascular inflammation.
This inflammatory response is initiated in part by inducing
the nod-like receptor protein 3 inflammasome, a protein
complex that promotes the activation of caspase-1 and the
consequent maturation of the inflammatory cytokines
IL-1b and IL-18.9,15 In mouse models, inhibiting miR-92a
with antisense oligoribonucleotides reduces endothelial
inflammation and attenuates atherosclerosis.13 Of clinical
relevance is that the circulating level of miR-92a is inversely
correlated with FMD in patients with coronary artery dis-
ease (CAD).9
Given the prevalence of oxidative stress and EC dysfunc-
tion in CKD, miR-92a may play a role in EC dysfunction in
CKD. In this study, we examined (1) whether circulating
miR-92a level is increased in patients with CKD, (2) the
role of miR-92a in CKD-induced EC dysfunction by using
an EC culture model, (3) the EC origin of circulating miR-
92a by using human serum and a rat CKD model, and (4)
the correlation of serum miR-92a and IS levels in patients
with ESRD. The results obtained from patients with CKD,
cultured ECs, and adenine-induced CKD rats suggest a strong
link between CKD and CVD via uremic toxin–induced miR-
92a in the endothelium.

 RESULTS
Circulating miR-92a Level Is Increased in Patients
with CKD
We initially compared the circulating levels of miRs that are
known to regulate EC homeostasis in patients with CKD and
age-matched controls in a cohort from Xi’an, China (cohort 1,
site A) (Table 1). Notably, other than the presence or absence of
CKD, the two groups were comparable in sex, age, and other
variables that might affect circulating miR-92a levels (e.g.,
smoking history, existing CAD, diabetes mellitus, and lipid
profiles) (Table 2 shows basic characteris-
tics). Among the miRs that regulate
eNOS-derived NO bioavailability and anti-
inflammation (i.e., miR-92a, miR-126,
miR-155, and miR-483), the level of miR-
92a differed the most between patients with
CKD and controls (23.6-fold increase in
CKD; P,0.001) (Figure 1A). To further ex-
amine whether circulating miR-92a level
was associated with CKD severity, we ex-
panded this cohort to include patients
with various stages of CKD on the basis of
eGFR (n=79 patients in total) (Table 3
shows basic characteristics). The circulating
miR-92a level increased with increasing
CKD stage (i.e., stage 1 , stage 2 , stage
3 , stage 4 , stage 5) (Figure 1E).
Circulating miR-92a Level Is Inversely
Correlated with Renal Function
With the finding of the increased miR-92a
level in sera from patients with CKD, we
next examined whether the circulating
miR-92a level is correlated with eGFR. We
initially examined this correlation in the
aforementioned discovery cohort at site A
(n=79) and found an inverse correlation be-
tween level of circulating miR-92a and
eGFR (rs=20.79; P,0.001) (Figure 2A,
Table 4). To validate this inverse correlation,
we used an existing dataset of patients with
moderate CKD and stable CAD of syn-
drome X in Taipei, Taiwan9 (cohort 2a,
site B; n=89) (Table 1). Table 5 shows the
patient characteristics of this cohort. The
level of miR-92a was also inversely corre-
lated with eGFR in cohort 2a (rs=20.46;
P,0.01) (Figure 2B, Table 6). The associa-
tion of CKD with increased miR-92a level
was further confirmed in a third cohort
from Salt Lake City, Utah that included ex-
clusively patients with ESRD who were on
hemodialysis and did not have a detectable
GFR (cohort 3, site C; n=17 per group)
(Table 1). Circulating miR-92a level was higher in patients
with ESRD than healthy controls (Figure 2C). Together, Fig-
ure 2 (with data collected from three geographically different
sites) suggests that the serum level of miR-92a is inversely
correlated with renal function.
CKD Serum Induces miR-92a Expression and
Endothelial Dysfunction
Next, we examined the effect of uremic serum on ECs by
incubating cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells
(HUVECs) with sera from patients with CKD. Compared with
Figure 1. miR-92a levels are elevated in circulation of patients with CKD (cohort 1).
Patients with CKD and age-matched controls (Ctrl) were recruited from a nephrology
clinic in Xi’an (site A). (A–D) qPCR analysis of mRNA serum levels of miR-92a, miR-126,
miR-155, and miR-483 with C. elegans miR-39 as a spike-in control and (E) serum miR-

termined by eGFR. *P,0.05.

 control serum, CKD serum significantly increased the levels of
both mature miR-92a and primary transcripts of miR-92a in
HUVECs (Figure 3, A and B). Thus, the CKD serum–induced
increase in miR-92a level in ECs was mediated, at least in part,
by transcriptional induction of endogenous miR-92a.
In ECs, miR-92a targets SIRT1, KLF2, and KLF4, which are
essential for endothelial homeostasis and function.9 We hy-
pothesized that the increased serum level of miR-92a in pa-
tients with CKD would negatively affect EC function via the
targeting of these molecules. Indeed, the mRNA and protein
levels of SIRT1, KLF2, and KLF4 were decreased in HUVECs
treated with CKD serum (Figure 3, C and D). Concurrent with
the suppression of these key molecules for endothelial homeo-
stasis, the mRNA and protein levels of eNOS were also de-
creased (Figure 3, C and E). In contrast, the level of caspase-1
p20, a hallmark of inflammasome activation,15 was increased
in the CKD serum–treated HUVECs (Figure 3E). Thus, CKD
serum promoted miR-92a–associated endothelial dysfunction
as signified by a decrease in eNOS-derived NO bioavailability
and an increase in an inflammatory state.
EC dysfunction in CKD has been attributed in part to
increased oxidative stress.16 Similar to many other vascular in-
sults, CKD serum increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels
in HUVECs (Figure 4A). To investigate whether oxidative stress
contributed to the CKD serum induction of miR-92a in ECs, we
pretreated HUVECs with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine
(NAC).NAC treatment indeedblocked the CKD serum induction
of miR-92a (Figure 4B) and the suppression of SIRT1, KLF2,
KLF4, and eNOS (Figure 4C). In line with the antioxidative effect
of NAC, anti–miR-92a also rescued the expression of these
endothelial-protective genes (Figure 4D).
We have previously shown that the serum level of miR-92a
is inversely correlated with FMD among patients with di-
agnosed stable CAD9. Because CKD is an independent risk
factor for CVD17, we further explored whether the circulat-
ing level of miR-92a is correlated with EC function in human
patients with CKD. As shown in Supplemental Figure 1,
circulating miR-92a levels in cohort 2a were inversely cor-
related with FMD (P,0.001) but positively correlated with
levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (P,0.001) and
IL-1b (P=0.02).
Uremic Toxins Induce miR-92a Expression in ECs
We next examined which uremic toxins in CKD serum were
responsible for the oxidative stress–induced miR-92a by incu-
bating ECs with IS, HA, IAA, and pCS. As shown in Figure 5, A–
D, IS, HA, and IAA but not pCS (although pCS is a potent
vascular toxin3) dose-dependently increased the expression of
miR-92a in ECs. Because IS had the most
prominent effect on miR-92a induction and
an increased level of IS in CKD has been
linked to endothelial dysfunction,18 we se-
lected IS as a prototypic uremic toxin in in-
hibitory experiments involving NAC or
anti–miR-92a. The inclusion of NAC in
the EC culture greatly reduced the IS-induced
miR-92a level (Figure 5E). Furthermore, both
NAC and anti–miR-92a substantially rescued
the suppressed expression of SIRT1, KLF2,
KLF4, and eNOS (Figure 5, F–H). The results
in Figures 4 and 5 indicate that CKD serum,
via uremic toxin–induced oxidative stress, in-
creased miR-92a level in ECs to result in a
dysfunctional endothelium by downregu-
lating SIRT1, KLF2, KLF4, and eNOS.

 Endothelium Origin of Circulating miR-92a in CKD
The results in Figures 3–5 prompted us to query the origin of
circulating miR-92a and whether it was derived from injured
ECs exposed to CKD. Because of the heterogeneity and com-
plexity of human serum, we first used an adenine diet–induced
CKD rat model to investigate the origin of miR-92a. This estab-
lished model has induced nephrotoxic conditions, with in-
creased creatinine level and uremia.19 The circulating level of
miR-92a was increased in serum from rats fed 0.25% adenine
diet for 8 weeks, a diet shown to impairendothelial function and
vasodilation19 (Figure 6A). Additionally, the level of CD144+
MP-associated miR-92awas markedly increased inthe rat serum
(Figure 6B), which suggests an association of increased miR-92a
level and CKD in adenine-administered animals and that the
elevated circulating miR-92a level was at least in part due to the
increased EC-derived miR-92a. As well, miR-92a level was in-
creased in aortas isolated from the adenine-fed CKD rats as
evidenced by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and
Taqman miR quantitative PCR (qPCR) (Figure 6, C and D).
This increase in miR-92a was attendant with a decrease in the
mRNA levels of KLF2, KLF4, and eNOS (Figure 6D).
To validate the endothelial origin of miR-92a in patients
withCKD,wedetectedthemiR-92alevelinCD144+MPsisolated
from CKD serum ofpatients fromsitesAand B. Indeed, miR-92a
level was greater in MPs from patients with CKD than controls
(Figure 6E). To link miR-92a level with kidney dysfunction and
uremia, we measured the levels of circulating miR-92a and IS in
the second cohort in Taipei (cohort 2b, site B) (Table 1), con-
taining exclusively patients with ESRD on hemodialysis20 (basic
characteristics are shown in Table 7), This analysis showed a
positive correlation between levels of circulating miR-92a and
both total and free IS in CKD serum (Figure 6, F and G, Table 8).
DISCUSSION
In this study, weidentified an increase incirculating levelofmiR-
92a in patients with CKD. Furthermore, data from patients with
CKD and adenine-administered rats indicated an endothelial
originofthecirculatingmiR-92aresultingfromuremia-impaired
endothelium. In cultured ECs, protein-bound uremic toxins,
particularly IS, induced miR-92a to activate inflammasome in
ECs and suppressed the expression of genes critical for endothe-
lialhomeostasis.Thisnovelmechanismwasfurthersupportedby
thepositivecorrelationbetweenlevelsofISandmiR-92ainserum
from patients with ESRD. Collectively, our findings suggest
miR-92a as a crucial link between CKD and CVD by mediating
uremia-impaired endothelial dysfunction.
To examine the circulating levels of miR-92a in patients with
CKD, we collected data from three independent clinical sites.
Because of theheterogeneity ofpatients withCKD(indiagnosis,
ethnicities, treatments, etc.) and variations in experimental
methods, we did notcombinethe data. Nevertheless, circulating
miR-92a level was consistently increased in patients with CKD
at all three sites. After adjustment for multiple variables, includ-
ing age, sex, smoking, diabetes mellitus, CAD, and hyperlipidemia,
the association of circulating miR-92a level and eGFR remained
significant (P,0.001) (Tables 4 and 6), which suggests that
CKD is an independent factor causing increased miR-92a
level in the circulation as a result of endothelial damage. Of
note, we examined the correlation between miR-92a level
and eGFR only in cohorts 1 and 2a because of the lack of
eGFR data for patients with ESRD in cohorts 2b and 3. Given
that endothelial dysfunction is an early pathologic event in
CKD,21 miR-92a level has promise as a diagnostic marker or
early predictor of CKD-associated vascular impairment. Be-
cause miRs are known to be stable in urine, we investigated

 the feasibility of detecting excreted miR-92a. However, the
miR-92a level is very low in urine from patients with CKD
(approximately 0.5% of that in the serum). Although miR-
92a level was increased compared with con-
trols with normal GFR, no significant
difference in miR-92a concentrations was
found among patients with stages 2–5
CKD (Supplemental Figure 2). Thus, al-
though miR-92a was detectable in human
urine, the low level raises question about
its reliability in CVD risk evaluation in pa-
tients with CKD. However, studies with
larger patient cohorts and more clinical out-
comes are warranted to assess the potential
for serum miR-92a level as a predictive/
diagnostic marker for endothelial dysfunc-
tion in CKD.
With respect to the origin of circulating
miR-92a level, the results from EC-derived
CD144+ MPs isolated from rat and human
serum suggest that miR-92a was secreted,
at least in part, from vascular ECs (Figure 6,
B and E). In line with this finding, patients
with CKD showed an increase in the EC-
derived and miR-enriched MPs, known to
be associated with endothelial dysfunc-
tion.11,22 Therefore, the elevated level of
miR-92a in CKD serum was likely a result
of dysfunctional ECs, which released CD144+ MPs, namely
EMPs. The increased miR-92a level was not likely the result
of increased retention, because miR-92a in the urine samples
was negligible (Supplemental Figure 2). Of
note, circulating miRs can also be transport-
ed in exosomes, apoptotic bodies, and
lipoproteins or conjugated with argonaute
proteins.23 miR-92a can be carried by
exosomes24 and HDL25 in CKD, which
deserves further investigation.
Our previous studies showed that miR-
92a is upregulated in ECs by elevated
oxidative stress.9 CKD causes increased
oxidative stress in the vessel wall, and
endothelial dysfunction is a common com-
plication of renal failure. To investigate the
endothelial response to the pathophysio-
logic environment of CKD in an in vitro
system, we incubated naïve ECs with hu-
man control or CKD serum. This approach
was previously established to test the effect
of oxidative stress induced by systemic in-
flammatory diseases in ECs.26 Using this
system, we showed that serum from pa-
tients with CKD induced miR-92a in naïve
ECs (Figure 3, A and B), which could be
mitigated by the antioxidant NAC (Figure
4B). These findings support miR-92a as a
link among CKD-induced uremia, oxidative
stress, and endothelial dysfunction (Figure

 7). This miR-regulated pathway may function in parallel or
crosstalk with other oxidative stress–induced pathways that im-
pair EC homeostasis.
To identify the components inCKD serum that caused miR-
92a induction in ECs, we found that several uremic solutes,
including IS, HA, and IAA, all increased miR-92a level in ECs
(Figure 5, A–C). Although pCS isalso commonly associated with
increased cardiovascular events in patients with CKD and has
deleterious effects on endothelium,27,28
miR-92a was not induced by pCS in ECs,
and therefore, pCS-induced endothelial dys-
function may be independent of miR-92a.
The endothelial toxicity caused by IS is well
established, which includes increased oxida-
tive stress, inhibition of NO production, and
endothelial inflammation.29 A recent study
also showed serum IS level as a novel risk
factor for dialysis graft thrombosis after
endovascular interventions.20 At the molec-
ular level, IS can increase the expression of
adhesion molecules, such as E-selectin, and
further lead to leukocyte adhesion and
activation through Janus kinase, p38
mitogen-activated protein kinase, and
NFkB.30 Because these molecules can be
directly or indirectly suppressed by several
miR-92a targets, including SIRT1, KLF2,
and KLF4, the IS–miR-92a cascade is likely
to potentiate the uremic toxin–induced
vascular inflammation. Relevant to this
concept, we found a positive correlation be-
tween levels of IS and circulating miR-92a
in patients with CKD (Figure 6, F and G).
We only performed this analysis for cohort
2b (site B), for which IS concentrations
were previously measured by HPLC with
relatively large volumes of blood, which
were unavailable for other cohorts.20 With
this limited cohort, we provide translational
evidence for the causal relationship between
uremic toxin and miR-92a–mediated endo-
thelial dysfunction.
In the vessel wall, miR-92a can promote
neointimal formation,31 a mechanism con-
tributing to the failure of arteriovenous
fistula maturation and a critical process re-
quired for hemodialysis in patients with
ESRD. miR-92 is also an important regula-
tor in other tissues. For example, the miR-
17–92 cluster can promote the profibrotic
TGF-b signaling pathway and glomerular
mesangial hypertrophy,32 a hallmark of
CKD progression. The increased miR-
92a level resulting from endothelial
damage may aggravate CKD and CVD via
multiple mechanisms, including deterioration of renal func-
tion, contribution to neointimal formation, and exacerbation
of endothelial dysfunction. Collectively, miR-92a may
potentiate a vicious cycle between kidney damage and vascular
injury (Figure 7). Given the potent and profound effects of
anti–miR-92a in maintaining EC function9,12,13 (Figures
4D and 5, G and H), miR-92a may be a potential therapeutic
target for treatment of CVD with CKD.

 CONCISE METHODS
Patients
We conducted our studies in compliance with recognized inter-
national standards, including the principles of the Declaration of
Helsinki. Patients with various stages of CKD (characteristics are
described in Tables 1–8) were recruited from three clinical sites:
site A: Xi’an, China; site B: Taipei, Taiwan; and site C: Salt Lake
City, Utah. The study was approved by respec-
tive local institutional review boards, and all
participants provided informed consent.

liliters per minute per 1.73 m2) =1753 (serum

if a woman) 3(1.212 if black). For cohort 1,
59 patients followed in a nephrology clinic
were recruited at site A with 20 age-matched
controls enrolled from the same site for 79
patients in total. For cohort 2a, 89 patients
with CKD with angiographically insignificant
CAD (coronary artery stenosis ,50%) and/or
syndrome X were enrolled from site B as de-
scribed.9 For cohort 3, 17 patients with ESRD
receiving maintenance dialysis in outpatient
dialysis clinics were recruited at site C, with
another 17 healthy controls enrolled. For co-
hort 2b, 43 patients with a diagnosis of ESRD
were undergoing hemodialysis at site B20;
serum samples for all 43 patients collected
previously for measuring IS content were in-
cluded in the study. An overview of the four
patient cohorts at three clinical sites is in Table
1. Blood samples were obtained from patients
with CKD not on dialysis or control partici-
pants by venipuncture and patients on mainte-
nance hemodialysis via the dialysis tubing
immediately before the hemodialysis session.
Blood samples were kept without anticoagu-
lant. Clots were removed by centrifuging at
3000 rpm for 15 minutes. Supernatants were
collected for analyses of serum creatinine and
miR-92a levels.
HUVEC Culture
HUVECs were obtained from the umbilical
cord vein by collagenase digestion or pur-
chased from CellApplications,Inc. (SanDiego,
CA), seeded on collagen-coated culture plates,
and grown in M199 medium under standard
cell culture conditions (humidified atmo-
sphere, 5% CO2, 37°C). HUVECs at passages
5–8 were used for the in vitro studies. For ex-
periments in which mRNA and protein levels
were measured, sera from three patients with
ESRD or three controls were pooled. These pooled serum samples
were diluted to 20% by using M199 culture media, added to
HUVECs, and incubated for 24 hours. Each experiment was repeated
in triplicate by using a different pool of three uremic serum samples
or three control samples. In separate experiments, IS, IAA, and HA
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) and pCS (IsoSciences,
King of Prussia, PA) were diluted in M199 culture media and used to
treated HUVECs.

 qPCR for miR and mRNA Expression and
Immunoblotting
The qPCR for mRNA expression analysis and immunoblotting were
performed following protocols as previously described.9 miR expres-
sion was determined by the Taqman miR assay (Life Technologies,
Carlsbad, CA). The data used for correlation between eGFR and cir-
culating miR-92a level were obtained from a study performed at site
B,9 in which the expression of serum miR-92a was measured and
normalized to that of miR-16a documented as a stable miR in sera
from patients with CAD. RNA extracted from other sera and CD144+
MPs was spiked with Caenorhabditis elegans miR-39 as described.33
The circulating level of miR-92a in these samples was normalized to
that of C. elegans miR-39 in the same samples. For miR-92a level in
HUVECs, U6 was detected as an internal control. Fold change in
expression was determined by the DDCt method.
Transfection of Anti–miR-92a
Control RNAwith a scramble sequence or anti–miR-92 was transfected
into HUVECs by use of Lipofectamine 2000 RNAi Max (Invitrogen)
with subsequent treatment with CKD serum or uremic toxins.
MP Extraction
CD144+ MPs were isolated as described with modifications.9 Briefly,
Dynabeads G (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) were washed with PBS con-
taining 0.1% BSA and then reconstituted with PBS. Anti-CD144
antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX) was mixed with
prewashed Dynabeads G for 2 hours and then incubated with serum
samples at 1:200 dilution overnight at 4°C. After
precipitation, Dynabeads G were washed with
PBS and 1% Tween-20 three times. After re-
moval of PBST, RNAwas extracted by the Trizol
method. The purity of CD144+ MPs, determined
by FACS analysis, was 70%65.6%. With the use
of FITC-conjugated beads as size references, the
size of such particles was assessed to be ,0.5 mm
in diameter.
ROS Staining and FISH
HUVECs were incubated with sera from pa-
tients with CKD (n=6; each group pooled
from two patients with ESRD) or healthy con-
trol serum (n=4; each group pooled from two
healthy subjects) for 24 hours. Live cell staining
of ROS involved use of CellROX Green Reagent (Life Technologies)
and was counterstained with NucBlue Live Rea.
miR-92a FISH was performed as described with modifications34; 59
TYE563–labeled locked nucleic acid for miR-92a was from Exiqon
(Vedbaek, Denmark). Briefly, paraffin-embedded rat aortic specimens
were deparaffinized and fixed. Then, 10 pmol locked nucleic acid
dissolved in 100 ml hybridization buffer was used for hybridization at
57°C for 30 minutes. Nuclei were counterstained with 4,6-Diamidino-
2-phenylindole (DAPI) for 10 minutes. Slides were then examined
under a fluorescent microscope.
Adenine Diet–Induced CKD Model in Rats
All animal studies and experiments wereapproved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committees at the University of Utah and
Veterans Affairs Salt Lake City Healthcare System and adhered to
the US National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals. Male Wistar rats weighing 250–300 g (9–10
weeks old; Charles River Laboratories) were fed a normal diet (Teklad
8604 Rodent Diet) with or without adenine supplementation (0.25%
wt/wt) for 8 weeks. The animals were then euthanized. Blood in the
heart was collected for serum analysis, and aortas were harvested for
FISH.

Figure 7. CKD-induced miR-92a potentiates endothelial dysfunction and contributes
to CVD. Uremic toxins (e.g., IS) in CKD increase the oxidative stress burden in vascular
endothelium. In turn, oxidative stress–induced miR-92a leads to endothelial dys-
function and is released through MPs into the circulation, which further impairs en-
dothelial homeostasis to increase the CVD risk.

 Statistical Analyses
Data from in vitro experiments are expressed as mean6SEM from at
least three independent experiments. Data from analysis of serum
and animal models are expressed as mean6SD. Two groups were
compared by t test for normally distributed data and Mann–Whitney
U test for non-normally distributed data. Differences among multiple
groups were evaluated by ANOVA followed by the Bonferroni post hoc
test for equal sample sizes or the Newman–Keuls test for unequal
sample sizes. Analyses involved use of GraphPad Prism 7 (GraphPad
Software, San Diego, CA). Univariate correlation was analyzed by
Spearman correlation coefficient after determining the (non-)normal
distribution of data. Linear multivariate regression analysis involved
constructing models with the relative levels of circulating miR-92a as
the dependent variable with use of SPSS v20 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL).
Values of P,0.05 was considered statistically significant.
