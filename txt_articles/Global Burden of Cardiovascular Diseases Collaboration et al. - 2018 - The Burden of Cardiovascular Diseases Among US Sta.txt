 The Burden of Cardiovascular Diseases Among US States,
1990-2016
Global Burden of Cardiovascular Diseases Collaboration
IMPORTANCE Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the United States,
but regional variation within the United States is large. Comparable and consistent state-level
measures of total CVD burden and risk factors have not been produced previously.
OBJECTIVE To quantify and describe levels and trends of lost health due to CVD within the
United States from 1990 to 2016 as well as risk factors driving these changes.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Using the Global Burden of Disease methodology,
cardiovascular disease mortality, nonfatal health outcomes, and associated risk factors were
analyzed by age group, sex, and year from 1990 to 2016 for all residents in the United States
using standardized approaches for data processing and statistical modeling. Burden of
disease was estimated for 10 groupings of CVD, and comparative risk analysis was performed.
Data were analyzed from August 2016 to July 2017.
EXPOSURES Residing in the United States.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Cardiovascular disease disability-adjusted life-years
(DALYs).
RESULTS Between 1990 and 2016, age-standardized CVD DALYs for all states decreased.
Several states had large rises in their relative rank ordering for total CVD DALYs among states,
including Arkansas, Oklahoma, Alabama, Kentucky, Missouri, Indiana, Kansas, Alaska, and
Iowa. The rate of decline varied widely across states, and CVD burden increased for a small
number of states in the most recent years. Cardiovascular disease DALYs remained twice as
large among men compared with women. Ischemic heart disease was the leading cause of
CVD DALYs in all states, but the second most common varied by state. Trends were driven by
12 groups of risk factors, with the largest attributable CVD burden due to dietary risk
exposures followed by high systolic blood pressure, high body mass index, high total
cholesterol level, high fasting plasma glucose level, tobacco smoking, and low levels of
physical activity. Increases in risk-deleted CVD DALY rates between 2006 and 2016 in 16
states suggest additional unmeasured risks beyond these traditional factors.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Large disparities in total burden of CVD persist between US
states despite marked improvements in CVD burden. Differences in CVD burden are largely
attributable to modifiable risk exposures.

ardiovascular disease (CVD) was the leading cause of
death in the United States in 2016, accounting for more
than 900 000 deaths.1 Despite large declines in CVD
mortalityinthelate20thcenturyattributedtoadvancesinpub-
lic health and health care, improvements in US life expec-
tancy have slowed for some groups, and CVD mortality is no
longerimproving.2-5Thestrongestsignalforthisalarmingtrend
in US health is identified subnationally at the state and county
level, where levels of risk exposure and health vary widely.6-8
Geographic variation in CVD has many determinants, but
these are not usually evaluated in a consistent and compa-
rable manner across all states. Rapid changes in average risk
at the national level, such as large declines in plasma choles-
terol levels over a relatively short period due to increased use
of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibi-
tors, suggest that subnational evaluation of cardiovascular risk
is needed to understand persistent health disparities.9,10 Geo-
graphic variation in the quality of primary, prehospital, acute,
and long-term cardiovascular care also requires a comprehen-
sive, subnational assessment.11-13
The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study 20161 was a
study of global health across 332 causes of disease and injury
and 84 risk factors in 195 countries and territories. In this ar-
ticle, we report the study’
s US state-level results for CVD and
its modifiable risk factors.
Methods
Overview
The methods of the GBD Study 2016 have been reported in de-
tail previously.1,14-16 The study used data on incidence, preva-
lence, mortality, and risk exposure to produce comparable es-
timates of disease burden. All analyses were done separately
by sex and aggregated by 5-year age categories. A detailed dis-
cussion of data sources and methods are provided in eMethods
1 through 5 in the Supplement, with a brief overview below.
This study was reviewed and approved by the University of
Washington institutional review board, and informed con-
sent was waived because deidentified data were used.
Causes of CVD
Cardiovascular disease was estimated for the 10 most com-
mon global causes of CVD-related death and an additional cat-
egory that combined all other CVD and circulatory condi-
tions.Thesecauseswereischemicheartdisease(IHD),ischemic
stroke, hemorrhagic and other stroke, atrial fibrillation, pe-
ripheral artery disease, aortic aneurysm, cardiomyopathy and
myocarditis, hypertensive heart disease, endocarditis, and
rheumatic heart disease. Death due to each underlying CVD
cause was defined by categorization of International Classifi-
cation of Diseases (ICD) codes.1 Disease incidence and preva-
lence were defined according to a set of standard case defini-
tionsmappedtothesecodesbasedonexpertguidance.14These
included the third universal definition of myocardial infarc-
tion, the World Health Organization definition for stroke, elec-
trocardiographic identification of atrial fibrillation, diagnosis
ofperipheralarterialdiseasebyankle-brachialindex,theWorld
Heart Federation criteria for definite rheumatic heart dis-
ease, and the Framingham Heart Study definition of conges-
tive heart failure. Stroke deaths assigned to a non–subtype-
specific code (ICD code I64) were reassigned to subtypes using
the proportion of ischemic to hemorrhagic strokes.
Data
DatasourcesandmethodsforestimationofCVDhavebeenpre-
viously described.17 In brief, population counts were ob-
tained from the US Census Bureau for each state.18 Death cer-
tificate data were obtained from the National Center for Health
Statistics for each state. ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes were aggre-
gated for each cause of CVD. Structured reviews of published
literature were performed to identify published and unpub-
lished data on incidence, prevalence, case fatality, and mor-
tality related to CVD causes. State-level inpatient and outpa-
tient claims data were obtained from a database of private and
public insurance schemes for 2000, 2010, and 2012.19 ICD-9
codes were aggregated for each CVD case definition and used
to calculate the annual incidence (using inpatient data) or
prevalence rate (using inpatient and outpatient data com-
bined)forselectedhealthconditions,stratifiedbyage,sex,year,
and state. A correction factor was applied to account for
changesincodingofadministrativeclaimsdataovertime.Data
on risk factor exposure were obtained from multiple sources,
including the National Health and Nutrition Examination sur-
veys, the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance surveys, satel-
litedataandairsamplingdataforestimationofparticulatemat-
ter less than 2.5 μm in diameter, and a systematic review of
published scientific literature. Surveys with complex sam-
pling design, including National Health and Nutrition Exami-
nation surveys and Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance sur-
veys, were analyzed using appropriate sample weights to
accurately estimate variance. Risk factor definitions and at-
tribution methods have been previously reported.15 Defini-
tions of metabolic exposures included fasting plasma glu-
cose level measured in millimoles per liter, total cholesterol
level measured in millimoles per liter, systolic blood pressure
measured in millimeters of mercury, and body mass index (cal-
culated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters
squared).15

Key Points
Question How does the total burden of cardiovascular diseases
vary across US states?
Findings In this study using the Global Burden of Disease
methodology, large disparities in total burden of CVD were found
between US states despite marked improvements in CVD burden.
Meaning These estimates can provide a benchmark for states
working to focus on key risk factors, improve health care quality,
and lower health care costs.

 and state. Atrial fibrillation mortality was estimated with a
separate natural history model described below. DisMod-
MR, a Bayesian meta-regression tool developed for the GBD
Study,1 was used to estimate prevalence and incidence for each
cause. This software produced estimates for 6 estimation years
(1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2016), including data from
a selected number of years before and after each estimation
year when estimating for these time points. Interpolation was
performed to produce a continuous series of annual results.
Analysis was performed at the level of specific disease se-
quelae (for example, IHD due to acute coronary syndrome,
chronic stable angina, chronic ischemic heart disease, and is-
chemic cardiomyopathy) by age, sex, year, and state. Adjust-
ments were made to data that did not follow the selected case
definition (eg, electronic claims to clinical diagnosis) by a re-
gression model that crosswalked values in the direction of case
definition–based data.17 Heart failure prevalence was esti-
mated and then attributed proportionally to its underlying
causes,includingIHD,nonischemiccardiomyopathy,andmyo-
carditis. We include a separate analysis of total heart failure
prevalence, given its importance to clinical care and public
health. For atrial fibrillation, both prevalence and cause-
specific mortality were estimated using DisMod-MR because
mortality based on vital registration data alone provides an im-
plausibly steep increase over time believed to represent
changes in ascertainment rather than the disease’
s epidemi-
ology. Prevalence was estimated across a range of severities
for each condition as well as an asymptomatic state. Severity
levels for each disease were estimated using data from the
MedicalExpenditurePanelSurveyexceptforstroke,whichwas
estimated from a model of Rankin scores collected within
stroke registries, as described previously.17 Disability weights
were developed to represent functional capacity for each se-
veritylevelandmultipliedbyprevalencetocalculateyearslived
with disability (YLDs), a summary measure of health among
those living with a condition. Years lived with disability for se-
quelae are summed for their parent cause. Disability weights
for the GBD Study 2016,1 including data collection and meth-
ods, have been previously described.14,20,21 Adjustments were
madeforcomorbidityusingamicrosimulationprocessinwhich
persons had an independent probability of having each se-
quela, and the probability was derived from the prevalence es-
timates.Yearsoflifelost(YLLs)prematurelyduetoacausewas
calculated by multiplying observed deaths for a specific age
in the year of interest by a global age-specific reference life ex-
pectancy estimated using life table methods.
Disability-Adjusted Life-Years, Attributable Risks, and
Sociodemographic Index
The disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) is a summary mea-
sure of health that was calculated for each age-sex-year-
state-cause strata by summing the fatal (YLL) and nonfatal
(YLD) components.16 For example, age-sex-state-year–
specific numbers of YLLs due to IHD were added to the
matching YLDs due to IHD to produce DALYs due to IHD. By
dividing by population for that same strata, a DALY rate per
100 000 individuals was calculated. In the absence of health
examination data from states, we predicted mean systolic
blood pressure and total cholesterol levels for each state
with a regression model combining covariates from the
Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance surveys and National
Health and Nutrition Examination surveys. For risk factors
estimated as continuous variables, we developed an
ensemble distribution for each risk modeled using a family
of probability density functions, a fitting method, a model
selection criteria, and the method of moments.15 Population-
attributable fractions of disease by cause were modeled
based on estimates of exposure level, relative risk, and theo-
retical (eg, counterfactual) minimum risk levels using meth-
ods previously described.15 We accounted for joint effects of
combinations of risk factors when sufficient evidence
existed for a causal relationship. We modeled mediation
pathways using individual-level data from prospective
cohort studies and estimated the proportion of cardiometa-
bolic effect from each metabolic and behavioral risk factor.
We performed a decomposition analysis of the change in
DALYs from 2006 to 2016, estimating the change in CVD DALYs
that would be observed after removal of the effects of popu-
lation aging, population growth, and GBD Study 2016 CVD–
associated risks.1 The decomposition analysis was under-
taken at the all-risk level, taking into account risk mediation
at the most detailed cause level. This was repeated at the most
detailed risk-outcome level. The contribution of risk expo-
sures over longer periods, eg, 2006 to 2016, or at higher cause
aggregates, eg, all-CVD mortality, were calculated as the lin-
ear aggregate of the effect of individual risks at the most de-
tailed cause level and period.
To provide a consistent comparison by socioeconomic
status, a sociodemographic index (SDI) was estimated by
state using equally weighted age-sex-state-year–specific geo-
metric means of income per capita, educational attainment,
and total fertility rate. The metric of SDI was used for consis-
tency across all global locations included in the GBD 2016
Study.
The 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) reported for each es-
timate used 1000 samples from the posterior distribution from
the respective step in the modeling process, reported as the
2.5th and 97.5th values of the distribution. Age standardiza-
tion was calculated via the direct method, applying a global
age structure. Differences in estimates were considered sig-
nificant if 95% UIs did not overlap.
Results
SDI and Change in Total CVD Burden
Several states had large rises in their relative rank ordering for
total CVD DALYs among states, including Arkansas, Okla-
homa, Alabama, Kentucky, Missouri, Indiana, Kansas, Alaska,
and Iowa (Figure 1). A notable outlier was the (nonstate) Dis-
trict of Columbia, which achieved the highest SDI in the United
States from 1990 to 2016 while decreasing its age-
standardized CVD DALY rate from the highest in the United
States in 1990 (7044 DALYs per 100 000; 95% UI, 6194-7482)
to the 11th highest in 2016 (3821 DALYs per 100 000 persons;
95% UI, 3424-4209).

 Change in Total CVD Burden, 1990-2016
The age-standardized rate of CVD DALYs decreased signifi-
cantly in all states between 1990 and 2016, but there was wide
regional variation in the amount of this decline (Table; eTable
1 in the Supplement). The largest percentage change oc-
curred in the District of Columbia, New Hampshire, and New
York. The rate of decline varied by sex, with a slower decline
for women than men in all states (Figure 2A and B). The slow-
est decline was observed for women in Oklahoma, Arkansas,
and Alabama. Total CVD burden increased for both men and
womenfrom2010to2016inIndiana,Kentucky,Michigan,Mis-
sissippi, Missouri, New Mexico, and South Dakota.
Geographic Variation in Total and Cause-Specific CVD
Burden in 2016
There was wide geographic variation in the age-standardized
CVD burden among US states in 2016, with the greatest bur-
den concentrated in a band of states extending from the Gulf
Coast to West Virginia. The highest rate of CVD DALYs was in
Mississippi (4982 age-standardized DALYs per 100 000 per-
sons; 95% UI, 4475-5487), followed by Arkansas, Oklahoma,
Louisiana,Alabama,Tennessee,Kentucky,WestVirginia,South
Carolina, and Georgia (Table). Notably, several states outside
this region had levels of CVD DALYs nearly as high, including
Indiana,Missouri,Ohio,Michigan,NorthCarolina,Nevada,and
Texas. The lowest rate of CVD DALYs was in Minnesota (2352
age-standardized DALYs per 100 000 persons; 95% UI, 2148-
2552), followed by Colorado and areas of New England and the
Pacific Northwest, including Massachusetts, New Hamp-
shire, Washington, Connecticut, Vermont, and Oregon. Ische-
mic heart disease was the leading cause of age-standardized
CVD DALYs in all states and the District of Columbia (eFigure
1 in the Supplement). The second-leading CVD cause was is-
chemic stroke in all states. The proportion of DALYs due to YLD
(as opposed to YLL) ranged from 10% (in Mississippi) to 18%
(in Connecticut) (eFigure 2 in the Supplement).

 greater contributor and tobacco smoking became a lesser con-
tributor to CVD burden over time.
Drivers of Changes in Risk-Attributable DALYs
Figure 7 shows the relative contributions of 4 mutually exclu-
sive drivers of the observed change in CVD DALYs from 2006
to 2016 for each state: population growth, population aging,
trends in exposure to all CVD risk factors measured in the GBD
Study 2016,1 and all other unmeasured factors combined. The
change from 1990 to 2016 is shown in eFigure 4 in the Supple-
ment. Most states had an increase in CVD DALYs during this
time despite all states experiencing a decrease in CVD-
relatedriskexposures.Populationagingandpopulationgrowth
accounted for most of this increase. Notably, the residual cat-
egory of unmeasured factors, which would account for health
care–related treatment and any other exposures not included
in the GDB Study 2016 evaluation of traditional CVD risk fac-
tors, explained increases in many states, suggesting that un-
measured risk exposures are increasing the burden of CVD in
many parts of the United States.
Discussion
Large disparities in total burden of CVD persist between US
statesdespitemarkedimprovementsinCVDburden.Wefound
that it took 25 years for states with the largest burden of CVD
to achieve levels observed among the healthiest states in 1990.
States with the highest burden of CVD in 1990, such as Ken-
tucky, West Virginia, Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Tennes-
see, and Oklahoma, are only now achieving the 1990 levels of
CVD burden in Massachusetts, Connecticut, and New Jersey.
Mississippi continues to lag as the state with the largest CVD
burden in the United States. These findings support the idea
that tremendous gains in cardiovascular health are possible
even in states with lower socioeconomic levels but that rela-
tivedisparitiesbetweenstateshavechangedverylittle.22These
relative disparities may be of particular concern for Alabama,
Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Tennessee, given their recent de-
cision to not expand their respective Medicaid systems.23
We found increases in the total burden of CVD in 12 states
from 2010 to 2016 (eFigure 5 in the Supplement). Several stud-
ies have noted increasing all-cause mortality for selected sub-
groupsorregionsoftheUnitedStates.Lifeexpectancyhasbeen
decreasing among women in some counties.6 It has been sug-
gested that increasing body mass index will result in decreas-
ing life expectancy in the United States.24 Our finding of
increasing CVD burden is concerning and suggests that long-
term decline in CVD may be ending. New clinical or public
health interventions delivered earlier in the life course may be
required to alter this alarming trajectory.
The District of Columbia, a small urban area tracked sepa-
rately, is a notable outlier that demonstrates the potential for
improvements in the burden of CVD for cities. This region ex-
periencedmarkedimprovementsinsocioeconomicstatussince
1990, as reflected by our summary measure of SDI. The Dis-

 trict of Columbia also experienced particularly rapid declines
in CVD. The causal relationship between socioeconomic sta-
tus and health has been well described.25 Also, wide varia-
tion in the rate of change for cardiovascular mortality has been
shown for small geographic regions, such as counties.26 Mi-
gration of healthier individuals into the District of Columbia
and states or migration of sicker individuals out of these lo-
cations may have also contributed to changes in CVD burden.
An intriguing finding of our study was that socioeco-
nomic status did not fully explain a population’
s level of CVD
burden or risk factors. States with lower rates of CVD burden
were found across the full range of SDI. Prior research has sug-
gested a causal association between higher altitude and lower
CVD mortality, which could explain lower CVD burden in some
Mountain and Southwestern states.27 Variation in health care
quality between states, another possible explanation, has been

 less well documented than variation between specific hospi-
tals or health care referral regions but may be substantial. Fi-
nally, some aspects of socioeconomic status may not be well
accounted for by our index, such as wealth (as opposed to in-
come per capita) or attained level of maternal education.
Research and policy have focused extensively on race and
ethnicity as independent risk factors for CVD in the United
States.28 The GBD 2016 Study did not stratify health by these
categories, and a full discussion of this important topic is be-
yond the scope of this article. For example, disparities attrib-
uted to race may in fact reflect differences in access to high-
quality health care or genetic factors.29 The concentration of
CVD burden in states with higher proportions of individuals
that identify their race as black/African American or Ameri-
canIndian/AlaskaNativeisawell-knownobservation.30-32The
association of race/ethnicity and risk are complicated by the
observation that self-reported race/ethnicity differs from ge-
neticbackground.Furthermore,reportedriskassociationshave
differed for various regions of the country, suggesting effect
modification by local factors.33,34 The addition of race-
specific and ethnicity-specific state-level estimates is an im-
portant goal for future iterations of the GBD Study and will al-
low for further exploration of these issues.
Diseases caused wholly or in part by atherosclerotic vas-
cular disease (IHD, stroke, peripheral artery disease, or aortic
aneurysm)accountedforthelargestportionofCVDinallstates.
Most of this burden was due to IHD. As noted above, esti-
mates of heart failure were disaggregated to their underlying
cause in this analysis, including IHD; burden due only to heart
failure is not reported. More than 80% of CVD burden could
be attributed to known modifiable risk factors. The preven-
tion of CVD through the reduction of these well-known risk
factors remains a major public health goal for the United
States.35Clinicaltrialshaveshownthatmedicationsshouldtar-
get lower levels of systolic blood pressure and plasma low-
density lipoprotein cholesterol for many patients.36-39 To-
bacco cessation also remains a major target for health systems
and local governments.40 In addition to these clinical and pub-
lic health goals, our analysis shows that a large proportion of
CVD can also be attributed to dietary risks, high body mass in-
dex, and low physical activity. Notably, air pollution has con-
tinued to decrease in terms of its relative contribution to CVD
in the United States.41 Both rheumatic heart disease and en-
docarditisaccountforasmallbutpersistentproportionofCVD.

 combination of diverse data sources used to produce these
results, the 95% uncertainty range is an important feature of
our analysis that should be considered whenever interpret-
ing a particular point estimate. Our nonfatal modeling pro-
cess has improved significantly over the lifetime of the GBD
Study, yet several challenges remain, including incorpora-
tion of uncertainty because of using multiple nonreference
case definitions (such as cohort and claims data), quantify-
ing the generalizability of claims data, identifying additional
data on disease severity, accounting for the interdependence
of comorbidities, and moving from cross-sectional estima-
tion to a method that accounts for birth cohort effects.
Our analysis has several specific limitations. First, esti-
mates at the level of US states represent an aggregate across
a range of substate geographies, such as counties and urban
vs rural areas. State-level estimates remain important given
that many policy decisions continue to be made uniformly at
the state level; however, further analysis is needed to exam-
ine differences between other geographic categories, such as
urban and rural regions. Bias in death certification related to
CVD has been demonstrated.42 Our results correct for some
of this bias by adjusting for the use of nonspecific and inter-
mediate ICD codes. Second, for this analysis, we applied a
method to account for the variable use between states of
nonspecific or intermediate causes on death certificates.
Other biases in death certification are more difficult to cor-
rect in a state-specific manner, such as the common coding
of death to ICD code I64 (stroke, unspecified type), which
were reassigned to stroke subtypes using the same ratio of
subtypes for each state.43 Third, our source for administra-
tive health care data was limited to a database of mostly
commercial payers, which may underestimate incidence and
prevalence of disease if those with employer-based health
plans are healthier than the general population. Incidence
data for CVD is particularly limited in the United States.
These claims data are available at the individual level for
inpatient and ambulatory care and for all ages in all states
across multiple years but do not include care covered solely
by Medicare. Prevalence of CVD may be lower among those
with private, employee-based insurance than those using
Medicare or without health insurance. Administrative data
were used only for conditions where it was felt to be reliable
based on validation studies and expert opinion; however,
some degree of misclassification bias, with both overestima-
tion and underestimation, is likely from these sources.
Expanding the GBD Study to include Medicare data is an
important goal for future versions of the study. Fourth, our
attribution of CVD burden to modifiable risk factors assumes
a theoretical minimum level of exposure rather than the
treatment goal of any set of existing intervention. For
example, we rely on data from prospective cohort studies
and clinical trials to set the minimum level of systolic blood
pressure at 110 to 115 mm Hg. This level was selected
because it is at this level that the lowest association with
CVD outcomes is observed.44 We do not make any assump-
tions (or provide any estimates of health gains) regarding a
specific level to be targeted by antihypertensive medication.
Furthermore, while there is good evidence for causality for

 each risk and paired CVD outcome, the precise causes in any
given population cannot be known with certainty. Fifth, esti-
mates of prevalent heart failure are based on administrative
claims data and carry the assumption that all cases pre-
sented to hospitals. Subclinical heart failure is therefore not
included in these estimates. Sixth, our study is, by design,
cross-sectional and therefore descriptive and hypothesis-
generating rather than the basis for causal claims. Finally,
this analysis does not report CVD due to 2 cardiovascular
conditions, Chagas cardiomyopathy and congenital heart
disease. Several hundred thousand cases of Chagas cardio-
myopathy may be present in the United States.45 Estimates
for disease burden due to congenital heart disease in the
United States have been reported previously.46
Conclusions
Cardiovascular disease is a major cause of lost health in the
United States but varies widely in level among states. Most
CVD burden in the United States is from atherosclerotic vas-
cular disease, and 80% can be attributed to known causal
risk factors. We found that CVD burden has improved for all
states, but the rate of decline varies widely and is strongly
associated with an index of socioeconomic level. For 12
states, CVD burden has increased since 2010. These esti-
mates can provide a benchmark for states working to focus
on key risk factors, improve health care quality, and lower
health care costs.
