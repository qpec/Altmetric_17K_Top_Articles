Abstract
Background
Despite the well-recognised health benefits of fresh fruit consumption, substantial uncertain-
ties remain about its potential effects on incident diabetes and, among those with diabetes,
on risks of death and major vascular complications.
Methods and findings
Between June 2004 and July 2008, the nationwide China Kadoorie Biobank study recruited
0.5 million adults aged 30–79 (mean 51) y from ten diverse localities across China. During
~7 y of follow-up, 9,504 new diabetes cases were recorded among 482,591 participants
without prevalent (previously diagnosed or screen-detected) diabetes at baseline, with an
overall incidence rate of 2.8 per 1,000 person-years. Among 30,300 (5.9%) participants who
had diabetes at baseline, 3,389 deaths occurred (overall mortality rate 16.5 per 1,000),
along with 9,746 cases of macrovascular disease and 1,345 cases of microvascular dis-
ease. Cox regression yielded adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) associating each disease out-
come with self-reported fresh fruit consumption, adjusting for potential confounders such as

 age, sex, region, socio-economic status, other lifestyle factors, body mass index, and family
history of diabetes. Overall, 18.8% of participants reported consuming fresh fruit daily, and
6.4% never/rarely (non-consumers), with the proportion of non-consumers about three
times higher in individuals with previously diagnosed diabetes (18.9%) than in those with
screen-detected diabetes (6.7%) or no diabetes (6.0%). Among those without diabetes at
baseline, higher fruit consumption was associated with significantly lower risk of developing
diabetes (adjusted HR = 0.88 [95% CI 0.83–0.93] for daily versus non-consumers, p <
0.001, corresponding to a 0.2% difference in 5-y absolute risk), with a clear dose–response
relationship. Among those with baseline diabetes, higher fruit consumption was associated
with lower risks of all-cause mortality (adjusted HR = 0.83 [95% CI 0.74–0.93] per 100 g/d)
and microvascular (0.72 [0.61–0.87]) and macrovascular (0.87 [0.82–0.93]) complications
(p < 0.001), with similar HRs in individuals with previously diagnosed and screen-detected
diabetes; estimated differences in 5-y absolute risk between daily and non-consumers were
1.9%, 1.1%, and 5.4%, respectively. The main limitation of this study was that, owing to its
observational nature, we could not fully exclude the effects of residual confounding.
Conclusion
In this large epidemiological study in Chinese adults, higher fresh fruit consumption was
associated with significantly lower risk of diabetes and, among diabetic individuals, lower
risks of death and development of major vascular complications.
Author summary
Why was this study done?
• Worldwide evidence on the relevance of fruit consumption for the occurrence and pro-
gression of diabetes is still limited, although most dietary guidelines, including those for
diabetes patients, recommend a higher level of fruit consumption.
• Although fruit and vegetables are often considered together, fruit may not be viewed as
being as healthy as fresh vegetables for individuals with diabetes, given its relatively high
sugar content. This has led to frequent abstention from fruit consumption among indi-
viduals with diabetes in many parts of the world (e.g., China).
• No prospective evidence has been available thus far showing the potential long-term
impacts of fresh fruit consumption on the incidence of diabetes and, among individuals
with diabetes, on the risks of diabetes-related vascular complications. Reliable findings
on these two relationships within a single large cohort would be important for health
promotion.
What did the researchers do and find?
• We recruited over 500,000 Chinese adults from ten diverse areas across China during
2004–2008. Participants completed a detailed questionnaire interview and underwent

years.
• Among individuals who were free of diabetes (either previously diagnosed or newly
detected) at the start of the study, daily consumption of fresh fruit was associated with a
12% lower relative risk of developing diabetes, compared to never or rarely consuming
fresh fruit.
• In those individuals who already had diabetes prior to the start of the study, consuming
fresh fruit more than three days a week was associated with a 17% lower relative risk of
dying from any cause and a 13%–28% lower risk of developing diabetes-related compli-
cations affecting large blood vessels (e.g., ischaemic heart disease and stroke) and small
blood vessels (i.e., kidney diseases, eye diseases, and neuropathy) than those who con-
sumed fruit less than one day per week.
What do these findings mean?
• To our knowledge, this is the first large prospective study demonstrating similar inverse
associations of fruit consumption with both incident diabetes and diabetic
complications.
• These findings suggest that a higher intake of fresh fruit is potentially beneficial for pri-
mary and secondary prevention of diabetes.
• For individuals who have already developed diabetes, restricted consumption of fresh
fruit, which is common in many parts of the world, e.g., China and other Asian coun-
tries, should not be encouraged.
Introduction
Diabetes affects more than 400 million people globally, including about a quarter in China [1],
with substantial risks of premature death and a range of macrovascular (e.g., ischaemic heart
disease [IHD], stroke, and peripheral vascular disease) and microvascular (e.g., nephropathy,
retinopathy, and neuropathy) complications. Healthy diet plays an important role in both pre-
vention and appropriate management of diabetes [2], and diets rich in fruit and vegetables are
generally recommended [3,4], even though evidence about their effects, particularly for fruit
consumption, among diabetic patients is still rather limited.
Fruit and vegetables share many common nutritional properties, but are often consumed in
different settings and manners, especially in China, where fresh fruit is usually consumed raw
as a snack while fresh vegetables are usually fried or stewed (often together with meat, cooking
oil, and salt) as main dishes. Moreover, the sugar content in fruit is generally higher than in
vegetables, leading to concerns about its potential harmful impacts on diabetes [5]. A few pro-
spective studies have tried to assess the effects of fruit intake on risk of diabetes, but the results
have been inconsistent, with some studies showing a moderately strong inverse association
[6,7] and others, including those in China [8] and in European populations [9], finding no
association. Furthermore, there is very limited evidence about the effects of fruit consumption

 on risks of death and major vascular complications among people with established diabetes
[10–12]. Reliable assessment of the effects of fruit consumption on risks of incident diabetes
and, among those who have already developed diabetes, on diabetic complications is urgently
needed to improve dietary recommendations, especially in low- and middle-income countries
such as China and other Asian countries where avoidance of sweet-tasting food (including
fresh fruit) is common among diabetic patients [13–15].
With data from the China Kadoorie Biobank study, a prospective cohort study of 0.5 mil-
lion adults, we examined the association of fresh fruit consumption with the risk of developing
diabetes among people without baseline diabetes, and with the risks of death and major vascu-
lar hospitalisations among people with prevalent diabetes at baseline.
Methods
The China Kadoorie Biobank study was conducted in accordance with a predefined study
protocol [16,17], and data analyses were performed following a prespecified analysis plan (S1
Text).
Ethics statement
Ethics approval was obtained from the Oxford University Tropical Research Ethics Commit-
tee, the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences Ethical Review Committee, the Chinese Center
for Disease Control and Prevention Ethical Review Committee, and the scientific review
boards in each of the ten regional centres.
Study population
The China Kadoorie Biobank study is a large nationwide prospective cohort study involving
ten geographically diverse regional sites (five urban and five rural) in China, chosen to cover a
wide range of risk exposures and disease patterns, all with good-quality death and disease
registries and local capacity. The study design, methods, and population have been reported
previously [16,17]. In brief, between June 2004 and July 2008, all non-disabled permanent resi-
dents within preselected communities aged 35 to 74 y were invited to participate in the study,
and about one in three (33% in rural areas, 27% in urban areas) responded, yielding a total of
512,891 participants (including a few who were just outside the targeted age range); all partici-
pants provided written informed consent.
Data collection
At the local study clinics, trained health workers administered a laptop-based questionnaire on
socio-economic status, smoking, alcohol intake, diet, physical activity [18], and medical his-
tory; measured anthropometrics and blood pressure; and took 10 ml of venous blood for
on-site testing of random blood glucose (RBG) (with time since last eating or drinking any
energy-containing foods or beverages recorded) and for long-term storage. RBG level was
measured immediately following sample collection using the SureStep Plus System (Johnson &
Johnson), which provided plasma-equivalent readings and was regularly calibrated with man-
ufacturer control solutions. Individuals with no prior history of physician-diagnosed diabetes
but with RBG levels between 7.8 and 11.1 mmol/l were invited back the following day for a
fasting blood glucose test. At baseline, individuals were considered as having prevalent diabe-
tes if they had either a self-reported prior history of physician-diagnosed diabetes or screen-
detected diabetes, which was defined as having never been diagnosed with diabetes but having
a measured RBG level �7.0 mmol/l with time since last food/beverages �8 h, or �11.1 mmol/l

 with time since last food/beverages <8 h, or a fasting blood glucose level �7.0 mmol/l on sub-
sequent testing [19]. Dietary data covered 12 major food groups, including fresh fruit, fresh
and preserved vegetables, meat, and dairy products, each with five frequency levels about
habitual consumption during the past 12 mo (daily, 4–6 d/wk, 1–3 d/wk, monthly, or never/
rarely) [20].
Following the baseline survey, 5%–6% of the surviving participants were randomly selected
for resurveys in 2008 (first resurvey, response rate 80%) and 2013–2014 (second resurvey,
response rate 76%), using procedures similar to those at baseline. During the second resurvey,
in addition to frequency, the quantity of each food group consumed was also collected, which
was used as a proxy to estimate the group average consumption for each baseline category
(S1 Table).
Follow-up for mortality and morbidity
All participants were followed up (2,411 [0.5%] participants were lost to follow-up by 1 January
2014) for death and disease using information collected through linkages with death and dis-
ease registries and health insurance databases. The vital status of each participant was obtained
periodically through China’s Disease Surveillance Points system [21], checked annually against
local residential and health insurance records, and by street committees or village administra-
tors. In addition, information on any episodes of hospitalisation was collected through link-
ages with disease registries (for stroke, IHD, cancer, and diabetes) and national health
insurance claim databases. Cause-specific deaths and non-fatal events were coded, blinded to
baseline information, by the trained staff using ICD-10 [16]. In addition, diagnosis descrip-
tions of diabetes-related events (both fatal and non-fatal) were reviewed and standardised cen-
trally by study clinicians blinded to baseline fruit consumption. For the present study, incident
diabetes included all reported cases (fatal or not) of new onset diabetes that occurred between
ages 35 and 79 y. Underlying causes of death were classified as diabetes, cardiovascular disease
(CVD), or other. Diabetes-related microvascular complications included nephropathy, reti-
nopathy, and neuropathy. Macrovascular complications included IHD, stroke, and other (S2
Table). Only the first non-fatal event for each endpoint was considered.
Statistical analysis
For baseline characteristics, means (standard deviations) or percentages of individuals by dia-
betes status were calculated, adjusting for age, sex, and region, where appropriate, using either
multiple linear (for continuous outcomes) or logistic regression (for binary outcomes).
Among the 482,591 participants who were free of diabetes at baseline, hazard ratios (HRs)
and 95% CIs for diabetes incidence by fresh fruit consumption level were estimated using Cox
proportional hazard regression. Analyses were stratified by age at risk, sex, and region and
were adjusted for education (four categories), annual household income (four categories),
smoking (four categories), alcohol intake (four categories), physical activity (continuous vari-
able), body mass index (BMI) (continuous variable), survey season (four categories), family
history of diabetes (dichotomous), and consumption of meat (three categories), dairy products
(three categories), and preserved vegetables (five categories).
Among those 30,300 participants with diabetes at baseline, Cox regression was used to
investigate the association of fruit consumption with hospitalisations due to different diabetes
complications. The main analyses grouped participants into three categories of fruit consump-
tion (<1 d/wk, 1–3 d/wk, or >3 d/wk) in order to retain a reasonable number of cases in each
group. In addition to the covariates mentioned above, baseline CVD and diabetes status (both
as dichotomous variables) and anti-diabetic treatment (four categories) were also adjusted for.

 Separate analyses of the first and second halves of the follow-up period showed no clear
deviation from the proportionality assumption. The floating absolute risk method was used to
calculate the confidence intervals of HRs in all categories (including the reference category) of
fruit consumption. The traditional approach with an arbitrarily chosen reference group is
unsatisfactory as the standard errors and associated CIs are dependent on the precision within
the reference group; therefore, comparisons can only be made with the reference group. In
contrast, the floating absolute risk method estimates standard errors and CIs using “floated”
variances to provide appropriate variances to the log relative risk (i.e., HR in our analyses) for
all exposure categories, including the reference category. Hence, valid comparisons can be
made between any two exposure groups for polychotomous risk factors [22,23]. To further
quantify the linear association between fruit consumption amount and disease risks and to
account for regression dilution bias [24,25], we used data from the two resurveys to estimate
mean usual fruit intake (portions/month) for each baseline category (S1 Table). The group
mean levels of usual consumption were used to plot against the HRs in each baseline exposure
category and to yield the effect size per one daily portion (i.e., 100 g/d) of usual fruit consump-
tion through the Cox regression analyses.
Adjusted HRs for each one daily portion of usual fruit consumption were calculated across
strata of potential effect modifiers, e.g., factors related to diabetes risk and diabetes stage, and
chi-square tests for trend and heterogeneity were applied to the log HRs and their standard
errors. In addition, sensitivity analyses investigated the potential impacts of excluding the first
2 y of follow-up, excluding participants with prevalent CVD at baseline, and additional adjust-
ment for other dietary factors. For analyses of diabetes incidence, sensitivity analysis was also
performed excluding participants with incident CVD (i.e., myocardial infarction and stroke)
during follow-up.
All analyses were conducted in SAS (version 9.2), and graphs were plotted in R 3.0.2.
Results
Of the 512,891 participants, 30,300 (5.9%) had diabetes at baseline, including 16,162 with pre-
viously diagnosed diabetes and 14,138 with screen-detected diabetes (Table 1). Based on age at
diagnosis being <30 y and insulin use, 0.2% of the cases were likely to be type 1 diabetes. Indi-
viduals with diabetes were older and were more likely to be women, to live in urban areas, to
be less physically active, and to have higher levels of BMI, waist circumference, and blood pres-
sure. Among men, the proportions with current regular smoking and alcohol intake were
about 10% lower in those with previously diagnosed diabetes than in those with screen-
detected diabetes or those without diabetes.
Overall, 18.8% of participants reported consuming fresh fruit daily (daily consumers) and
6.4% never or rarely (non-consumers). The proportion of non-consumers among those with
previously diagnosed diabetes (18.9%) was about three times higher than among those with
screen-detected diabetes (6.7%) and those without diabetes (6.0%). There was an overall weak
inverse association of fruit consumption with blood glucose (RBG was 0.6 mmol/l lower
among daily consumers than non-consumers; S3 Table). A similar inverse association was
seen among those with previously diagnosed diabetes, even after additionally adjusting for all
other potential confounders including fasting time and anti-diabetic medications (S4 Table).
During ~7 y (3.4 million person-years) of follow-up, 9,504 new onset cases of diabetes were
recorded among the 482,591 participants without diabetes at baseline, with an overall inci-
dence rate of 2.8 per 1,000 person-years (Table 2). Participants with higher fruit consumption
had a significantly lower risk of developing diabetes, with the adjusted HR for daily consumers
versus non-consumers being 0.88 (95% CI 0.83–0.93) (Fig 1A). After adjusting for regression

 dilution bias, there was a clear log-linear dose–response relationship, with each one daily por-
tion of fruit associated with an adjusted HR of 0.88 (95% CI 0.81–0.95) (p for trend = 0.01).
This association was not significantly modified by sex, age, region, survey season, or a range of
other factors including smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity, BMI, and family his-
tory of diabetes (p for trend or heterogeneity � 0.2 for all; S1 Fig). Excluding baseline or inci-
dent IHD and stroke, additionally adjusting for other dietary variables, or excluding the first 2
y of follow-up did not materially alter the results (S5 Table).
Among the 30,300 participants who had prevalent diabetes at baseline, 3,389 (11.2%)
died during follow-up (overall mortality rate 16.5 per 1,000), including 1,459 (43.1%) from
CVD, 512 (15.1%) from diabetes (i.e., acute diabetic crises or other unspecified diabetes

 deaths without any immediate or antecedent cause of death, e.g., vascular or renal cause of
death), and 1,418 (41.8%) from other causes, including cancer (n = 790). Fruit consumption
was significantly and inversely associated with mortality from all causes (Fig 1B), diabetes,
and CVD, but not with mortality from other causes (including cancer) (Fig 2). Compared to
those who consumed fresh fruit <1 d/wk, individuals who consumed fruit >3 d/wk had
adjusted HRs of 0.86 (95% CI 0.80–0.94) for all-cause mortality, 0.64 (0.48–0.86) for diabe-
tes mortality, and 0.81 (0.72–0.92) for CVD mortality. These associations were approxi-
mately log-linear after correcting for regression dilution bias, with each one daily portion of
fruit associated with HRs of 0.83 (95% CI 0.74–0.93), 0.59 (0.40–0.87), and 0.78 (0.65–0.93),
respectively.
Fruit consumption was also inversely associated with risk of hospitalisation due to diabetic
vascular complications. Compared to consuming fruit <1 d/wk, consuming fruit >3 d/wk was
associated with a 26% (95% CI 16%–34%) lower risk of microvascular complications and 10%
(6%–14%) lower risk of macrovascular complications. Each daily portion was associated with
HRs of 0.72 (95% CI 0.61–0.87) and 0.87 (0.82–0.93), respectively (Fig 3). The strength of the
association of fruit consumption with individual complications was similar (Fig 4).
The strength of the associations between fruit consumption and diabetic complications
were largely consistent across subgroups of participants classified by baseline characteristics,
survey season, baseline RBG level, and diabetes status (previously diagnosed versus screen-
detected) (p for trend or heterogeneity � 0.1 for all; S2 Fig). Anti-diabetic treatment, age
of diabetes onset, and diabetes duration did not seem to modify the associations either
(S3 Fig).
Similar findings were observed when fresh fruit consumption was analysed in the original
five categories, although the trend was somewhat less consistent due to the smaller number of
cases in each group (Table 3). Additional adjustment for other dietary variables, excluding the
first 2 y of follow-up, or excluding diabetic participants with prevalent IHD or stroke at base-
line (n = 3,885) did not materially alter the observed associations (S5 Table).

 Discussion
This large prospective study of Chinese adults with and without diabetes showed that higher
fresh fruit consumption was significantly associated with a lower risk of developing diabetes,
and also with a lower risk of dying or developing vascular complications among those who
have already developed diabetes. These associations appeared to be similar in both men and
women, in urban and rural residents, and in those with previously diagnosed and screen-
detected diabetes. Moreover, higher fresh fruit consumption was not associated with elevated
level of blood glucose.
Several prospective studies have previously assessed the association of fruit consumption
with risk of diabetes, showing inconsistent findings [6,7,9,26–29]. For example, higher fruit
consumption was significantly associated with diabetes incidence in the Nurses’ Health Study
(with 6,358 cases) and a small Finnish study with 383 cases [6,30], with HRs of 0.82 (95% CI
0.72–0.92) and 0.69 (0.50–0.93), respectively, when comparing the highest with the lowest fruit
consumption category. No significant association, however, was observed in the European
Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)–InterAct study with nearly 11,000
incident diabetes cases [9] or a cohort study of Chinese women with approximately 1,600 new
diabetes cases [8]. In the most recent meta-analysis of >400,000 participants from 11 studies
with nearly 34,000 incident diabetes cases, higher fruit consumption was associated with a 9%
(95% CI 4%–13%) lower risk of diabetes incidence [27]. These previous studies were con-
ducted primarily among Western populations and tended to combine fresh fruit with pro-
cessed fruit (sometimes including also fruit juice), in contrast to focusing only on fresh fruit, as
in our study. This may partly explain the much stronger linear association observed in our
study. In addition, the stronger association we observed might also be due to the very low level
of fruit consumption among Chinese people and a non-linear dose–response association

 between fruit intake and diabetes risk [7,29]. Furthermore, our study has taken into account
regression dilution bias when estimating the linear associations [24,25] while few previous
large prospective studies have dealt with this important issue [31].
To date, very few large prospective studies have assessed the long-term health effects of fruit
consumption in people with diabetes, even though fruit has been rather consistently associated
with lower risk of CVD [20], a major complication of diabetes [19]. In two reports from the
EPIC study, one involving approximately 6,000 [12] and the other involving 10,500 [11] indi-
viduals with self-reported diabetes, one portion of fruit per day was significantly associated
with 12%–15% lower all-cause [12] and cardiovascular mortality [11]. Only one small study in
Japan has reported the association of fruit consumption with diabetes-related microvascular
complications. In that study of nearly 1,000 diabetic patients with 8 y of follow-up, individuals
in the highest quartile of fruit consumption had approximately 50% (HR = 0.48 [95% CI 0.32–
0.71]) lower risk of developing diabetic retinopathy (total 285 cases) [10]. Our study included
a much larger number of participants and well-characterised disease outcomes, with new find-
ings about the potential benefits of fresh fruit intake on a range of macro- and microvascular
complications of diabetes. In addition, a separate analysis of data from more than 70,000

 participants with existing CVD or hypertension in the China Kadoorie Biobank, with an over-
lap of about 10,000 participants with the current study, showed similar inverse associations of
fresh fruit consumption with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality [32].
This is the first cohort study to our knowledge reporting beneficial associations of fresh
fruit consumption with both incidence of diabetes and development of diabetes complica-
tions. Given the large sample size, our study findings are statistically robust even though the
causality of the association cannot be established from such observational studies. However,
the study also has limitations. First, our dietary questionnaire was not validated against
another reference method, and information on fruit types was not collected. However, the
previously observed inverse associations of fruit consumption with blood pressure and risk
of CVD [20] could indicate an appropriate predictive validity of this method in estimating
fruit consumption [33]. Moreover, the baseline level and secular trend of fruit consumption
observed in our study population were in line with the findings from nationally representa-
tive nutrition surveys that used three consecutive 24-h recalls to collect habitual intake [20].
Fruits with relatively lower glycaemic index (i.e., apples, oranges, pears, and berries) may
have larger beneficial effects on diabetes than those with a higher glycaemic index (i.e.,
bananas, grapes, and tropical fruits) [34], although previous studies have found both higher
and lower glycaemic index fruits to be associated with lower risk of diabetes [6]. Based on
data from the China Health and Nutrition Survey, the most frequently consumed fruits in
China are apples, pears, and oranges, which are temperate climate/low glycaemic index fruit.
Second, our baseline dietary data included consumption frequency only (not amount); there-
fore, the linear associations (i.e., HRs per 100 g/d) were estimated based on assumptions
(assuming daily portions of fruit consumption did not change from baseline to second resur-
vey). Also, our analyses could not be adjusted for total energy or specific nutrient intake, and
our data do not allow a reliable assessment of how much fruit per day is too much. Other die-
tary factors that may have an important association with diabetes, e.g., sugar-sweetened bev-
erages [35], could not be adjusted for due to lack of information. This, however, should not
confound our findings because the average sugar-sweetened beverage consumption level in
our population was very low [36]. Third, no information on vascular diseases other than
IHD and stroke was collected at baseline; thus, some cases of diabetes complications might
be recurrent instead of new onset. This again should not invalidate our findings, given the
very similar associations observed in individuals with newly detected diabetes (who should
be less likely to have diabetes complications at baseline) and previously diagnosed diabetes.
A proportion of diabetes cases might not have been detected at baseline because we did not
use post-load blood glucose and HbA1c tests at baseline. Such misclassification should be
non-differential (i.e., the proportion of undiagnosed diabetes cases should not be related to
the level of fresh fruit consumption) and therefore should not invalidate or overestimate the
observed associations of fruit consumption with diabetes incidence and vascular complica-
tions. Finally, although we carefully adjusted for potential confounders and there were

 consistent results across different participant subgroups, residual confounding (e.g., by
socio-economic status) may still persist. In other words, it is not possible to determine reli-
ably from this study whether the somewhat lower risks of diabetes incidence and diabetes
complications observed among those with higher fruit consumption were caused by fruit
consumption per se or were mainly due to other factors.
The exact mechanisms through which fresh fruit consumption may be protective against
the development and deterioration of diabetes are not very well understood. Fruit contains
sugars (i.e., glucose and fructose), which may have negative impacts on glycaemic control [37].
However, the natural sugars in fruit may not be metabolised in the same way as refined sugars
[38]. In our study, fruit consumption had a weak inverse, instead of positive, association with
levels of blood glucose, overall and in those with previously diagnosed diabetes. This is largely
consistent with previous findings showing that fresh fruit consumption had no significant neg-
ative impact on glycaemic control, even in people with diabetes [5,34,39,40]. More impor-
tantly, fruit is a good source of dietary fibre [41,42], minerals (e.g., potassium [43]), and
antioxidants (e.g., vitamins [44] and polyphenols [45]), which may work synergistically to con-
fer several benefits on metabolism—including anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, anti-prolifer-
ative, anti-platelet, anti-hypertensive, anti-dyslipidaemic, anti-hyperglycaemic, and anti-
atherogenic effects—and modulation of the composition and metabolic activity of gut micro-
biota [46–48], which could reduce the risk of diabetes as well as of vascular complications
among those who have already developed diabetes [46,49].
In summary, our study demonstrated that, among Chinese adults, higher fresh fruit con-
sumption was associated with lower risk of diabetes and diabetic vascular complications. Con-
trary to the common belief in China and many other low- and middle-income countries, fresh
fruit consumption was not associated with an elevated blood glucose level in the present study,
even in people with diabetes. These findings have public health and clinical implications and
provide strong evidence in support of current dietary guidelines that fresh fruit consumption
should be recommended for all, including those with diabetes [50]. In many developed coun-
tries, diabetes patients usually have higher fruit consumption than individuals without diabetes
due to targeted health promotion and nutrition education [12,51]. However, in China people
with previously diagnosed diabetes have a much lower level of fruit consumption, as observed
in the present study, because of the incorrect belief that diabetes, or “sugar urine disease” in
Chinese, will be better controlled if all sweet-tasting (or sugar-containing) foods, including
fresh fruit, are restricted or avoided [5,52–54]. This situation emphasises the importance,
given the present study findings, of better health promotion to improve public understanding
of the role of fresh fruit in diabetes prevention and management. Such actions are urgently
needed in China and other Asian countries, where diabetes prevalence is high and where, at
the same time, there is widespread misunderstanding about eating fresh fruit among people
with diabetes [40,55].
