 A Randomized, Controlled Trial of ZMapp for Ebola Virus 
Infection
The PREVAIL II Writing Group, for the Multi-National PREVAIL II Study Team*
Abstract
BACKGROUND—Data from studies in nonhuman primates suggest that the triple monoclonal 
antibody cocktail ZMapp is a promising immune-based treatment for Ebola virus disease (EVD).
METHODS—Beginning in March 2015, we conducted a randomized, controlled trial of ZMapp 
plus the current standard of care as compared with the current standard of care alone in patients 
with EVD that was diagnosed in West Africa by polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) assay. Eligible 
patients of any age were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either the current standard of 
care or the current standard of care plus three intravenous infusions of ZMapp (50 mg per 
kilogram of body weight, administered every third day). Patients were stratified according to 
baseline PCR cycle-threshold value for the virus (≤22 vs. >22) and country of enrollment. Oral 
favipiravir was part of the current standard of care in Guinea. The primary end point was mortality 
at 28 days.
RESULTS—A total of 72 patients were enrolled at sites in Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea, and the 
United States. Of the 71 patients who could be evaluated, 21 died, representing an overall case 
fatality rate of 30%. Death occurred in 13 of 35 patients (37%) who received the current standard 
of care alone and in 8 of 36 patients (22%) who received the current standard of care plus ZMapp. 
The observed posterior probability that ZMapp plus the current standard of care was superior to 
the current standard of care alone was 91.2%, falling short of the prespecified threshold of 97.5%. 
Frequentist analyses yielded similar results (absolute difference in mortality with ZMapp, −15 
percentage points; 95% confidence interval, −36 to 7). Baseline viral load was strongly predictive 
of both mortality and duration of hospitalization in all age groups.
CONCLUSIONS—In this randomized, controlled trial of a putative therapeutic agent for EVD, 
although the estimated effect of ZMapp appeared to be beneficial, the result did not meet the 
prespecified statistical threshold for efficacy. (Funded by the National Institute of Allergy and

 The 2014–2016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa was unprecedented in sheer scope, duration, 
and number of human casualties.1,2 The outbreak resulted in more than 28,000 suspected or 
confirmed cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) and more than 11,000 deaths.3 Fragile health 
care infrastructures that were often already severely compromised by past years of civil 
strife played a substantial role in the propagation of the outbreak. Although the final 
postmortem analysis of the global response has yet to be written, there can be little doubt 
that the lack of therapeutic agents and vaccines with proven efficacy against EVD further 
contributed to the ultimate magnitude of the epidemic.
From the outset, the most appropriate means of testing the small number of drugs that 
showed favorable preclinical activity against EVD for safety and possible efficacy has been 
debated.4,5 Varied opinions on prioritization of agents and the most effective means of 
testing them in the midst of a public health crisis persist to this day.6,7 The Partnership for 
Research on Ebola Virus in Liberia II (PREVAIL II) study was a randomized, controlled 
trial of one of the most promising of the available treatments, ZMapp, in patients who had 
received a diagnosis of acute Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV) infection.8 ZMapp is a mixture of 
three monoclonal antibodies directed against the surface glycoprotein of EBOV.
METHODS
TRIAL OVERSIGHT
The PREVAIL II trial was designed by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious 
Diseases (NIAID) and implemented in partnership with INSERM, the Republic of Sierra 
Leone Armed Forces, and the Ministries of Health in Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea. The 
members of the writing group were responsible for the collection and analysis of the data 
and for the preparation of the manuscript. Patients were enrolled from March 2015 through 
November 2015. Patients of any age who had positive test results for EBOV infection on a 
polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) assay and from whom written informed consent could be 
obtained were eligible. Ebola treatment units capable of providing the current standard of 
care were selected as trial sites by regional partners. Minimum requirements for the current 
standard of care included hemodynamic monitoring, the provision of intravenous fluids, 
laboratory testing, and the ability to deliver concomitant medications. The trial was approved 
by the NIAID institutional review board and applicable ethics boards in each site or country. 
Full details of trial design, conduct, and analyses can be found in the protocol and statistical 
analysis plan, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.
TRIAL DESIGN
ZMapp (Mapp Biopharmaceutical) was selected for an adaptive randomized, controlled trial 
design.9–11 A feature of this adaptive design was that an investigational agent that was 
subsequently shown to have activity against EVD could then be incorporated into an 
evolving standard of care, which was provided as the backbone of therapy in each trial group 
and against which newer agents could be tested. The primary objective was to determine 
whether the combination of ZMapp plus the current standard of care was both safe and 
superior to the current standard of care alone in managing EVD. Before launching the trial 
in Guinea, the Ministry of Health determined that the results of the JIKI trial were

 sufficiently compelling to warrant adding oral favipiravir therapy to the definition of the 
current standard of care for patients enrolled in that country.12
Randomization was stratified according to baseline PCR cycle-threshold value (≤22 cycles 
vs. >22 cycles) and location (Liberia and Sierra Leone vs. Guinea vs. the United States), 
resulting in six strata. ZMapp treatment was generally begun within 12 to 24 hours after 
randomization and consisted of three intravenous infusions of ZMapp (50 mg per kilogram 
of body weight), administered every third day.
Baseline symptoms were assessed as close to the time of randomization as possible, 
although with varying practices at Ebola treatment units, initial interventional measures 
(e.g., intravenous fluids and antipyretic agents) may in some cases have been instituted 
overnight before these assessments. Clinical status was recorded daily up to day 28, and vital 
status was reaffirmed on day 58 (data on serious adverse events were captured on both days).
An independent data and safety monitoring board convened seven times during the trial. In 
late 2015, the board endorsed a plan for stopping the trial if the already low incidence of 
EVD did not increase. On January 29, 2016, after Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea had 
been declared nearly Ebola-free, the trial was closed and the data unblinded.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
The primary end point was mortality at day 28. We calculated that 100 patients per group 
would need to be enrolled for the trial to have 88% power to detect a 50% relative difference 
in mortality between the two groups, assuming that the 28-day mortality in the group 
receiving the current standard of care alone was 40%.
Interim and final analyses were performed with the use of a Bayesian approach, as described 
previously.10,11 In brief, a skeptical “prior” distribution was formulated for the treatment 
effect: smaller effects were more likely than larger ones, and results were equally likely to 
favor either group. This prior opinion was then revised on the basis of trial data, leading to a 
“posterior” probability distribution for treatment effect for computation of the probability 
that ZMapp plus the current standard of care results in lower 28-day mortality than the 
current standard of care alone. A probability of 97.5% or more (akin to a one-sided type I 
error rate of 2.5%) was required to establish efficacy. Key analyses were summarized with 
both posterior probabilities and 95% credible intervals. Frequentist (conventional non-
Bayesian) analyses using Fisher’s exact test and Barnard’s test and the calculation of 
confidence intervals were also performed.
Kaplan–Meier survival curves were used to compare the two treatment groups. A stratified 
rank test was used to compare the two groups with respect to the time to viral clearance, 
which was defined as the time to a first negative PCR assay. For this analysis, patients who 
died within 28 days were given a worse rank than survivors, with earlier deaths given worse 
ranks than later deaths. To address concerns about whether some patients were too sick to 
receive a treatment benefit, we conducted a prespecified principal stratification analysis 
using logistic regression on baseline variables to develop a risk score for death and then to 
stratify according to low risk (≤50% probability) versus high risk (>50% probability).

RESULTS
PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS
The first patient enrolled was an American health care worker who was medically evacuated 
from Sierra Leone to the United States in March 2015. The last patient was enrolled in 
November 2015 in Liberia during a brief resurgence of EVD in that country. A total of 72 
patients (36 per group) (Fig. 1) were enrolled at two sites in Liberia, seven sites in Sierra 
Leone, one site in Guinea, and one site in the United States (Table S1 in the Supplementary 
Appendix, available at NEJM.org).
The two treatment groups were generally well balanced, although higher percentages of 
children and of women were enrolled in the ZMapp group than in the group that received the 
standard of care alone (children, 42% vs. 22%; and women, 64% vs. 47%) (Table 1). In the 
cohort as a whole, the mean (±SD) time from the onset of clinical symptoms to 
randomization was 4.2±2.7 days. The mean PCR cycle-threshold value for EBOV at trial 
entry was 23.9±5.3 cycles, with 42% of the patients having cycle-threshold values of 22 or 
less.
At enrollment, patients were asked to report any subjective symptoms of EVD that they had 
had within the previous 24 hours. The symptoms reported by at least half the participants at 
trial entry were loss of appetite (72%), weakness (69%), fever (68%), fatigue (59%), and 
abdominal pain (50%) (Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix).
SUPPORTIVE CARE AND ZMAPP INFUSIONS
The supportive measures that were provided as the current standard of care during days 1 
through 14 of the trial were similar in the two groups (Table S3 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). Before ZMapp infusions, patients were often given antihistamines (94% in cycle 
1) and antipyretic agents (65% in cycle 1) to ameliorate side effects (Table S4 in the 
Supplementary Appendix).
MORTALITY
Of the 71 patients who could be evaluated, 21 died, representing an overall case fatality rate 
of 30%. Death occurred in 13 of 35 patients who received the current standard of care alone 
and in 8 of 36 patients who also received ZMapp, leading to crude estimates of 28-day 
mortality of 37% and 22%, respectively (Table 2). The Bayesian estimate of the absolute 
difference in mortality between the ZMapp group and the group that received the standard of 
care alone was −14 percentage points, and the relative difference was −38%. These mortality 
differences gave a 91.2% posterior probability that ZMapp plus the current standard of care 
was superior to the current standard of care alone; this value was below the prespecified 
probability threshold (≥97.5%) for declaring superiority of the investigational treatment. The 
95% credible interval for the absolute difference in mortality was −34 to 6 percentage points, 
and the 95% credible interval for the relative risk of death was 0.29 to 1.24. Frequentist

 results gave a mortality difference of −15 percentage points (95% confidence interval [CI], 
−36 to 7) and a relative risk of 0.60 (95% CI, 0.25 to 1.27). A sensitivity analysis that 
included the single patient who was lost to follow-up resulted in posterior probabilities of 
the superiority of ZMapp of 89.8% under the assumption that the patient survived and 93.5% 
under the assumption that the patient died.
Seven of the eight deaths recorded in ZMapp recipients occurred before day 4 — that is, 
before the second of three planned infusions of ZMapp (Fig. 2). The exception was one 
patient who received a second infusion on day 4 and died later that day. In the group that 
received the current standard of care alone, all 13 deaths occurred during the first 8 days of 
follow-up (Table S6 in the Supplementary Appendix).
SECONDARY EFFICACY OUTCOMES
We evaluated the influence of both treatment assignment and baseline cycle-threshold values 
on the median number of days to viral load clearance and to discharge from the Ebola 
treatment unit (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). Among patients with cycle-
threshold values above 22 at trial entry, those who received the current standard of care plus 
ZMapp had significantly shorter stays in Ebola treatment units than did recipients of the 
current standard of care alone.
The percentage of patients who had various clinical symptoms of EVD (Fig. S2 in the 
Supplementary Appendix) and the total number of symptoms reported daily (Fig. S3 in the 
Supplementary Appendix) during the first 2 weeks were examined, with adjustment for the 
number of reports collected at each time point. Although there was a suggestion that the 
symptoms in the ZMapp recipients cleared more readily, these observations were 
confounded by the differential mortality in the two groups (i.e., patients who died no longer 
contributed to daily reports) and therefore a potential for bias, even though this effect should 
have favored the group that received the current standard of care alone.
SAFETY
The percentage of patients with serious adverse events was similar in the two groups: 37% in 
the group that received the current standard of care alone and 31% in the group that also 
received ZMapp (P = 0.62). Only one serious adverse event (hypertension) in ZMapp 
recipients was judged to be related to the infusion itself (Table S5 in the Supplementary 
Appendix).
Adverse events related to ZMapp infusions were reported most commonly during the first 
infusion (25%) and decreased with subsequent infusions (11% with infusion 3). Fever (14% 
with infusion 1) and hypotension (11% with infusion 1) were the most common adverse 
events reported (Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix). Mitigation actions consisted 
primarily of either infusing the drug more slowly during a particular administration or 
stopping the infusions plus administering antipyretic agents or other medications. A total of 
8 of 93 infusions (9%) were stopped owing to adverse events, whereas 9 of 93 infusions 
(10%) were slowed in order to ameliorate side effects.

 SUBGROUP ANALYSES OF MORTALITY
We performed analyses in subgroups defined according to age, geographic location of 
enrollment, and baseline cycle-threshold value. Across each of these subgroups, mortality 
differences favored ZMapp recipients (Fig. 3). Principal stratification analysis showed that 
among patients with a lower risk of death (≤50% probability), those who received ZMapp 
had significantly lower mortality than those who received the current standard of care alone 
(0 of 24 patients vs. 4 of 20 patients), with a Bayesian estimate of an absolute difference in 
risk of −18 percentage points (95% credible interval, −39 to −2); the posterior probability 
that ZMapp plus the current standard of care was superior to the current standard of care 
alone was 98.5%. Frequentist analyses supported this conclusion (see the Statistical 
Supplement in the Supplementary Appendix).
DISCUSSION
In this randomized, controlled trial of a new treatment for acute EVD, the posterior 
probability that ZMapp plus the current standard of care was superior to the current standard 
of care alone was 91.2%. The overall 28-day crude mortality was 15 percentage points lower 
among those assigned to ZMapp plus the current standard of care than among those assigned 
to the current standard of care alone (22% vs. 37%), which corresponds to a 40% lower 
relative risk of death with ZMapp. If sustained, a mortality difference of 15 percentage 
points would translate to approximately 15 lives saved for every 100 patients treated. 
However, this outcome fell short of the prespecified 97.5% probability for superiority.
Although the trial was launched within weeks after the trial drug became available, the 
notable successes of numerous public health measures in reducing and aiming to extinguish 
EVD in the affected countries resulted in our not being able to attain the desired enrollment 
of 100 participants per group. As a consequence of early termination, the 95% credible 
intervals for the absolute difference in mortality and for the relative risk of death are wide: 
−34 to 6 percentage points and 0.29 to 1.24, respectively. In addition, although mortality 
differences according to the age of enrollees (<18 vs. ≥18 years of age), location of 
enrollment (country), and baseline viral load (cycle-threshold value) all favored the ZMapp 
group, credible intervals were even wider for these subgroups.
If ZMapp did indeed confer some degree of therapeutic benefit, at least two main factors 
may have limited the magnitude of the mortality trend that we observed. Although trial 
patients were clinically symptomatic for only a few days before randomization, at 
enrollment they were probably 1 week or longer past their date of actual infection. This 
delay in initiating therapy exceeded the 5-day window within which ZMapp had been shown 
to provide 90% or greater survival in the nonhuman primate lethal-challenge model.8 In 
addition, seven of the eight deaths recorded in ZMapp recipients occurred before day 4, 
which was before administration of the second of three planned infusions. Thus, 
theoretically, if the full potential efficacy of ZMapp is realized only after the completion of 
multiple infusions, most of the patients dying from EVD in that group would have died 
before full dosing was achieved.

 Stratification according to country was included because of the concern that access to the 
types of supportive measures generally available in North America might be limited in West 
Africa or unevenly distributed among the three involved West African countries. In this 
regard, certain, but not all, Ebola treatment units (e.g., the Emergency Ebola Treatment Unit 
in Sierra Leone) were able to provide care at the level of an intensive care unit. Too few 
patients were enrolled in Guinea to determine whether inclusion of favipiravir further 
enhanced survival in that country.
Stratification according to baseline cycle-threshold value was instituted because of the 
perception that patients with very high viral loads at presentation might die despite the use 
of generally effective medical countermeasures. This was one of the conclusions drawn from 
the JIKI trial of favipiravir in Guinea, for example, and was raised by several other studies as 
well.14–20
No major safety concerns were identified with the use of ZMapp. Despite the drawback of 
an intravenous infusion that had to be given three times over the course of a week, the full 
course of ZMapp was successfully administered 91% of the time to recipients who survived 
that first week of the trial.
In considering both the choice of investigational drugs and the most appropriate trial design 
in which to study them, each group testing clinical research interventions during the 2014–
2016 epidemic faced the unenviable task of having to weigh numerous exigencies 
accompanying the study of potential therapeutic interventions for a highly lethal infection, 
their own proper sense of the moral imperatives imposed on trial design by a humanitarian 
crisis, and the evolving cultural milieu in which those considerations arose. In the case of 
this trial, which was launched during the second half of the epidemic, we believed that a 
randomized, controlled design would be the most expedient and definitive means of 
establishing the absence of a harmful effect and of determining whether the very favorable 
preclinical data in support of ZMapp might actually translate directly into lives saved. The 
advantages of randomized studies have been discussed extensively by others.5,21–23 True 
confidence in the findings of studies of treatments with potentially small-to-moderate effects 
on mortality is often enhanced by well-performed randomized trials; in their absence, there 
is a greater risk that such treatment effects may be masked by selection bias and 
confounding. Although a major strength of the PREVAIL II trial was its randomized design, 
its weaknesses include an open-label as opposed to double-blind design (i.e., potentially 
influencing observational bias at the bedside) and the early termination owing to the 
dramatic decline in the number of infected patients.
The laudable and rapid decline in eligible new cases of EVD was a factor that no trial design 
could anticipate, and it affected our ability to reach definitive conclusions. Despite the 
concerted efforts of many dedicated researchers domestically and internationally who 
participated in this and other trials, the outbreak appears to have ended with no 
incontrovertible evidence that any single treatment intervention, or combination of 
interventions, was unequivocally superior to the types of supportive medical care typically 
provided.24

 In another sense, however, the trial did succeed in establishing that it is indeed feasible to 
conduct a randomized, controlled trial in the context of a major public health emergency 
despite the challenges involved. Furthermore, with a 91.2% probability favoring a treatment 
effect for ZMapp, arguably this inconclusive but suggestive outcome has altered the sense of 
equipoise that accompanied this particular product at the start of the trial. How far from 
neutral this equipoise has shifted may be a matter of judgment. However, in the event of 
another outbreak, that experimental niche should probably be filled by one of a small 
number of other promising, but unproven, treatments that have emerged since the beginning 
of the recent crisis.25–27 As new epidemics emerge, undoubtedly coupled with their own set 
of challenges, it is important that any experimental interventions be evaluated in as rigorous 
a manner as possible so that their success or failure can be declared with the confidence that 
public health policy demands.
