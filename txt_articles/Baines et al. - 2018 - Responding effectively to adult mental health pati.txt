Abstract
Background: Responding to online patient feedback is considered integral to patient 
safety and quality improvement. However, guidance on how to respond effectively is 
limited, with limited attention paid to patient perceptions and reactions.
Objectives: To identify factors considered potentially helpful in enhancing response 
quality; coproduce a best- 
practice response framework; and quality- 
appraise exist-
ing responses.
Design: A four- 
stage mixed methodology: (i) systematic search of stories published 
on Care Opinion about adult mental health services in the South West of England; (ii) 
collaborative thematic analysis of responses to identify factors potentially helpful in 
enhancing response quality; (iii) validation of identified factors by a patient- 
carer 
group (n = 12) leading to the coproduction of a best- 
practice response framework; 
and (iv) quality appraisal of existing responses.
Results: A total of 245 stories were identified, with 183 (74.7%) receiving a response. 
Twenty- 
four (9.8%) had been heard but not yet responded to. 1.6% (n = 4/245) may 
lead to a change. Nineteen factors were considered influential in response quality. 
These centred around seven subject areas: (i) introductions; (ii) explanations; (iii) speed 
of response; (iv) thanks and apologies; (v) response content; (vi) signposting; and (vii) 
response sign- 
off that were developed into a conceptual framework (the Plymouth, 
Listen, Learn and Respond framework). Quality appraisal of existing responses high-
lighted areas for further improvement demonstrating the framework’s utility.
Conclusion: This study advances existing understanding by providing previously una-
vailable guidance. It has clear practical and theoretical implications for those looking 
to improve health- 
care services, patient safety and quality of care. Further validation 
of the conceptual framework is encouraged.

1 | INTRODUCTION
Patient feedback is considered integral to quality improvement 
and patient safety.1-4 The advent of Web 2.0 and subsequent elec-
tronic word- 
of- 
mouth (eWOM) platforms such as Patient Opinion 
(now Care Opinion) (www.careopinion.org.uk) and iWantGreatCare 
(www.iwantgreatcare.org) has transformed not only the ways in 
which patients access and evaluate health- 
care services, but also the 
way in which they publically share their health- 
care experiences.5-7 
However, in spite of their acknowledged importance and increas-
ing use,8 limited attention has explored how health- 
care organiza-
tions respond to patient feedback online, how patients perceive and 
react to these responses, and how organizational responses might 
be improved.5
Being able to effectively respond to patient feedback is consid-
ered important if health- 
care providers are to better monitor patient 
safety and quality of care,1 improve systemic issues and encourage 
patient- 
centred care.4,5,9,10 As described by Doig and others, it is 
possible to complete a feedback process with a higher opinion of 
the organization if the feedback process has been satisfactory.5,9 
In contrast, the provision of an unsatisfactory response can lead 
to negative emotions including frustration and dissatisfaction.9,11 
While some patients may accept that service provision can go wrong 
due to human error, as suggested by Rio- 
Lanza, an organization’s re-
sponse, or indeed lack of response, to the service failure can be the 
most likely cause of service dissatisfaction.10 Understanding factors 
that can help facilitate effective organizational responses is there-
fore imperative.10,12
In opposition to medical or health- 
care service literatures 
which have typically taken a procedural and epidemiological 
view of feedback processes, other literatures such as those from 
business and hospitality disciplines have developed a significant 
body of research.5 Such literatures indicate that organizational 
responses can have profound implications for public inferences 
of trust, perceived responsiveness, organizational reputation, 
customer satisfaction and further complaint behaviour.9 One 
theory often applied in business and hospitality literatures to un-
derstand response dissatisfaction is perceived justice, or justice 
theory.10,12,13 Based on the premise that perceptions of organi-
zational responses influence satisfaction and future behavioural 
intentions,12 justice theory is a multifaceted construct encom-
passing three dimensions: procedural, interactional and distrib-
utive justice. Procedural justice refers to the perceived fairness 
of policies and procedures used by the responding organization 
with response waiting times, accessibility and perceived efficiency 
considered particularly important. Interactional justice focuses on 
the manner in which individuals are treated during the response 
process, for example with courtesy, respect, honesty and assur-
ance, while distributive justice relates to the perceived fairness 
of the outcome offered by the responding organization such as 
compensation.10,13 As described by Blodgett et al and others, jus-
tice theory is considered a valuable framework for understanding 
reactions to organizational responses.10,12,13 However, it is yet to 
be applied in a health- 
care environment that specifically explores 
patient reactions to online responses.
Informed by principles of collaborative working,14 this research 
sought to explore patient reactions to existing organizational re-
sponses leading to the development of a coproduced conceptual 
framework. It advances existing understanding by moving beyond 
complaints as historically researched,5 avoiding a “top- 
down” ap-
proach by collaborating with a volunteer mental health patient- 
research- 
partner and wider patient- 
carer support group (Heads 
Count; http://www.colebrooksw.org/heads-count/), and exploring 
patient response reactions from a population frequently described 
as “seldom heard”—mental health.15-17
For brevity, the term “patient” is used to be inclusive of service 
users, customers, clients, consumers, carers and/or family members, 
although the important distinctions between these terms are ac-
knowledged. For clarity, we have used “response” to mean an or-
ganizational response and “stories” to mean feedback provided by 
patients.
2 | METHODS
2.1 | Design
We used a mixed- 
methodology approach comprised of four inter-
related stages. Firstly, adult mental health stories published on one 
of the United Kingdom’s leading patient feedback websites, Care 
Opinion (previously Patient Opinion), were identified through a sys-
tematic search. Secondly, a representative sample (20%, n = 37) of 
identified responses from the initial sample were thematically ana-
lysed using an inductive approach in collaboration with a volunteer 
patient- 
research- 
partner to identify factors potentially helpful in 
enhancing response quality. Thirdly, factors considered influential 
were discussed and refined by a wider patient- 
carer stakeholder 
group (n = 12), Heads Count, leading to the coproduction of a best- 
practice response framework. Finally, existing responses were 
quality- 
appraised using the developed framework.
Due to resource constraints and the large number of patient sto-
ries published on Care Opinion at time of publication (over 190 345), 
only stories and corresponding responses made in the South West 
of England were included.
Care Opinion was selected as the database for this research due 
to its ability to directly respond to patient feedback through a di-
alogue exchange and its high number of responding organizations, 
over 600 at the time of publication. The focus on a single website 
such as TripAdvisor, of which Care Opinion shares some similar func-
tions, has been adopted in other research studies.18
Care Opinion works on the premise that (i) patients share their 
story, (ii) the story is sent to relevant staff members to facilitate 
learning, (iii) patients receive a response, and (iv) the original patient 
story may lead to a beneficial change. On publication, staff members 
in subscribing organizations who have opted into alerts are made 
aware of the story. Other relevant organizations are also contacted 
by Care Opinion. A responder may indicate in their response that 
     |  889
BAINES Et Al.
they have made a change as a result of the feedback received. This 
claim is made by the responder and not Care Opinion. A self- 
reported 
change is then visually shown on the website. It is up to individual or 
organizational discretion who responds. There is no guarantee that 
patients will get a response. All stories and subsequent responses 
published on Care Opinion are publically available providing real- 
time feedback with the intention of providing cost- 
effective, mea-
surable and transparent improvements.
Responses to adult mental health stories were selected because 
of the acknowledged difficulties in satisfactorily responding to this 
population. Mental health is often reported as one of the most prob-
lematic areas to obtain, and respond to, patient feedback due to 
acknowledged trust issues and low response rates.19 O’Regan and 
Ryan suggest that exploring patient feedback in mental health is of 
paramount importance as patients are more likely to maintain con-
tact with medical services if they are satisfied with their care.20 This, 
in turn, has implications for reducing clinical relapse incident and 
hospital admission rates affecting patient well- 
being and resource 
expenditure.20
2.1.1 | Search strategy
Stories about adult mental health services or experiences in the 
South West of England published by Care Opinion from its inception 
in January 2005 to 25 January 2017 were systematically searched 
using the following search terms: “mental health” OR “mental ill-
ness” OR “mentally ill” OR “mental” OR “pnd” OR “psychiatrist” OR 
“psychiatry” OR “depression” OR “anorexia” OR “anxiety” OR “eating 
disorder” OR “psychology” OR “psychosis” OR “psychotic” OR “ptsd” 
OR “self- 
harm.” Search terms were designed using the Peer Stories 
of Electron Search Strategies (PRESS) guidance21 in collaboration 
with the patient- 
research- 
partner and CEO of Care Opinion to maxi-
mize sensitivity and specificity.
2.1.2 | Data selection
One reviewer independently screened all identified stories using a 
piloted inclusion criteria form to ensure inclusion/exclusion stand-
ardization. To maintain accuracy, a representative sample (20%, 
n = 37) was also screened for inclusion by the patient- 
research- 
partner. Any discrepancies were resolved by discussion with a third 
research team member where needed.
2.1.3 | Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Only stories that discussed the treatment or diagnosis of a mental 
health condition, experience or service were included. Stories that 
did not achieve this were excluded. Exclusion examples include 
being anxious about a tooth removal operation.
2.1.4 | Data analysis
Data analysis was conducted in three interrelated stages:
1. An inductive thematic analysis of response content by the 
patient-research-partner and first author to collaboratively iden-
tify factors considered potentially helpful in a response.22 Due 
to the originality of this research, a deductive approach that 
imposed pre-defined categories may have restricted novel 
knowledge generation and was not therefore suitable for the 
purposes of this research.
2. Identified factors were refined and validated by Heads Count, a 
local mental health patient-carer support group (n = 12), through 
a round-table discussion. This was audio-recorded and tran-
scribed verbatim by the first author. During the two-hour discus-
sion chaired by a Heads Count member, the first author and 
patient-research-partner facilitated group discussion following 
the presentation of the representative sample (n = 37) reviewed 
by the patient-research-partner and identified factors in stage 1. 
After minor refinements to the wording of factors, the patient-
carer group and patient-research-partner organized factors into 
groups with minimal professional input. This process was facili-
tated by individually listing agreed factors onto Post-it notes and 
organizing them into logical groups accordingly. The framework is 
presented in the order agreed by participants. No new factors 
were suggested by participants at any stage.
3. The validated framework was then used to quality-appraise exist-
ing responses by the first author and patient-research-partner to 
determine how existing responses aligned themselves to patient 
perceptions and reactions.
3 | RESULTS
3.1 | Stage 1: story identification
From the 190 345 stories published on Care Opinion at the time 
of analysis, 2386 (1.25%, 2386/190 345) were identified as stories 
about adult mental health services in England. A total of 245 (10.3%, 
245/2386) were from the South West and analysed for the purposes 
of this research.
A total of 183 (74.7% 183/245) received a response from 41 dif-
ferent job roles or titles (see supplementary material). Thirty- 
eight 
(15.5%) stories were yet to be heard by a subscriber, and 24 (9.8%) 
had been heard but not yet responded to at the time of analysis. 
Only 1.6% (n = 4/245) of included responses were tagged by the or-
ganization as “may lead to a change.” The inclusion process is shown 
in Figure 1.
11% (n = 27/245) of identified stories received multiple re-
sponses. For clarity, only the first response was included for analysis.
3.2 | Stage 2: thematic analysis
Collaborative thematic analysis identified 19 factors as potentially 
helpful in enhancing organizational response quality. Some factors 
were considered only applicable to positive and/or negative stores. 
These are indicated in Table 1.

BAINES Et Al.
3.3 | Stage 3: validation of influential factors by 
stakeholder group
Factors considered influential by the patient- 
research- 
partner were 
reviewed and refined by a patient- 
carer stakeholder group (n = 12). 
During this stage, no new factors were suggested by participants. 
Only minor revisions to factor wording were suggested. Agreed fac-
tors primarily centred around seven subject areas: (i) introductions; 
(ii) explanations; (iii) speed of response; (iv) thanks and apologies; 
(v) response content; (vi) signposting; and (vii) response sign- 
off. 
Each subject area and its corresponding factors are discussed in turn 
below.
3.3.1 | Introductions
Introduction through the provision of a responder’s picture, name 
and role was considered essential. This was seen as a useful triad of 
information. Failure to do so was perceived as particularly problem-
atic “as it is hard to forge a trustful relationship with someone without 
knowing their name” (Heads Count patient- 
carer member [from here 
on H.C. member] 3). Participants wanted to know “who they are talk-
ing to” and “what their position is” (H.C. member 1), considering this 
as “standard good manners” (patient- 
research- 
partner). Introductions 
were considered “really important” (H.C. member 2), particularly if 
the patient had experienced a negative encounter.

3.3.2 | Explanations
Explanation of the responder’s role was also considered important 
due to perceived complexity of health- 
care services and importance 
of introductions mentioned above.
3.3.3 | Speed of response
The provision of a timely response was considered pivotal. A re-
sponse within 7 days was deemed acceptable by the mental health 
patient- 
research- 
partner and H.C. members, although a response 
within 3 days was considered desirable. Anything beyond these 
timescales was considered to hold important implications for the 
reputation, perceived responsiveness and sensitivity of organiza-
tions concerned.
3.3.4 | Thanks and apologies
Thanking patients for taking the time to write their stories was 
considered imperative irrespective of story content, that is posi-
tive or negative. Some terminology was deemed more favourable 
than others. For example, the phrase “thanks” was considered “al-
most sarcastic” (patient- 
research- 
partner), while “thank you” ap-
peared more sincere. In spite of this, the presence of a “thank you” 
was considered influential in patient response satisfaction by all 
participants.
Sharing positive feedback with those involved was also con-
sidered a central feature of patient response satisfaction. This was 
identified as one of “the sole reasons behind patients taking the time 
to provide feedback—it must get back to them, it must make a change, 
otherwise what’s the point?” (H.C. member 3).
In partnership with thanking story providers, offering an apol-
ogy was also considered imperative, particularly if the patient had 
experienced a negative or mixed encounter or a significant delay in 
response times.
3.3.5 | Response content
Tailoring response content was considered important: “the last thing 
you appreciate is a typed written response; you want to be treated as an 
individual, given an individual response” (H.C. member 4). Participants 
suggested patients are quick to detect “standardized” or “meaningless” 
responses (patient- 
research- 
partner). When examining organizational 
responses as part of the round- 
table discussion, one H.C. member 
stated: “it’s a couldn’t care less response, in my tray and out again, typical 
standard, makes you question what’s the point? It’s not going anywhere?” 
(H.C. member 7). In one of the examples reviewed, the original patient 
reviewer responded to the organization stating: “thank you for your au-
tomated response” (Care Opinion identifier 164520 from here on COI). 
H.C. members suggested patients require assurance or “evidence that 
they’ve [the responder] read the stories content” (H.C. member 6).
3.3.6 | Signposting
A further core function of responses identified was the signpost-
ing of other services. However, the assumption of patient awareness 
and understanding of such services was identified as particularly 
problematic by participants. For example, “not many people know 
about PALS [Patient Advice and Liaison service], will they take it up?” 
(H.C. member 9).
H.C. members also identified a critical need for responders to 
provide a specified contact name, opening times and multiple con-
tact options for signposted services as phone calls can induce anx-
iety, particularly “when you don’t even know the name, or role, of the 
person you’re supposed to be ringing” (H.C. member 12). Essentially 
forum members wanted to know “how do I contact you—phone, email

other means?” (H.C. member 10): something considered necessary to 
enable an “accessible” (H.C. member 2) dialogue between patients 
and a service.
3.3.7 | Sign- 
off
Finally, the phrasing of the sign- 
off used at the end of a response, for 
example, best wishes' and kind regards, was considered important. 
The ultimate question the patient- 
research- 
partner and stakeholder 
participants wanted responders to ask themselves before response 
submission was “would you be happy receiving this response?”
3.3.8 | Framework development
The organization of agreed factors during the round- 
table discussion 
led to the codevelopment of a best- 
practice response framework 
entitled the “Plymouth Listen, Learn and Respond framework” 
(PLLR) presented in Figure 2. Through this process, factors 10- 
11, 
14- 
15 and 16- 
17 were combined to encourage ease of use and 
understanding.
3.4 | Stage 4: quality appraisal of existing responses
Quality appraisal of existing responses using the agreed framework 
indicated a need for improvement in providing a picture of the re-
sponder; addressing the story provider; explaining the responders 
role; explaining why they in particular are responding; offering to 
make contact with the provider at a later date; directing the provider 
to relevant services and explaining the purposes of these services; 
and providing contact details, opening times and a named con-
tact for signposted services. A “traffic light” colour coding system

is used to denote areas of good practice and room for improvement. 
Results are discussed in the same seven subject areas as the preced-
ing stage.
3.4.1 | Introductions
27.9% (n = 51/183) of responses directly addressed the story 
provider (factor 3; Table 1), for example “Dear Anonymous” (COI 
177411). Less than 3% (n = 5/183, 2.7%) of responders provided a 
picture of themselves, their name and role (factors 1- 
3; Table 1). 
This may be due to Care Opinion historically not having picture 
provision as an option. However, where provided, this was posi-
tively experienced by participants, for example “that’s nice, she’s 
put a face to the name, nice smile, looks friendly, not like she’s going 
to jump down your throat in uniform” (H.C. member 3).
Over half of responders provided their name (n = 107/183, 
58.5%), with over two- 
thirds of responders also providing their role 
(n = 118/184, 64.5%) (factors 2 and 4; Table 1). However, 41 differ-
ent responding identities were reported (see supplementary mate-
rial). A responder themselves admitted the complexity of various 
roles and health- 
care systems: “I appreciate how confusing these sys-
tems can appear” (COI 224190).
In some cases (n = 3), the responder title did not match the re-
sponse’s content. For example, in one instance, the response was 
titled as Head of Engagement and Responsiveness, but then com-
pleted by the Clinical Director of adult mental health (COI 27919).
3.4.2 | Explanations
Despite the variability of roles identified (n = 41), no responder pro-
vided an explanation of their role, or explained why they in particular 
were responding (factors 5 and 6; Table 1).
3.4.3 | Speed of response
Response times significantly varied with responses ranging from 
0 to 1412 days (M = 31.2, SD = 145.1). When two outliers of 1412 
and 1208 days were included, the mean average response rate 
was 31.2 days. When removed, the mean average decreased to 
17.1 days (range = 585, M = 17.1, SD = 52.8). Although many organ-
izations offered reassurance (factor 11; Table 1) that “we take your 
comments very seriously” (COI 168497), and for patients to be “as-
sured that we are listening to you” (COI 198899), such assurances be-
came “undone” if organizations failed to respond in sufficient time. 
However, nearly half (49.7%, n = 91/183) of responders responded 
within 3 days of story publication. 66.1% (n = 121/183) responded 
within 7 days. Response times were considered important for the 
reputation, perceived responsiveness and sensitivity of services 
concerned. For example, “I have concluded the Trust does not seem 
to want to use service users feedback to provide a better service, I feel 
they have denied my complaint instead of using valuable feedback to 
gain improvements in bettering services for people in this area” (COI 
255461).
3.4.4 | Thanks and apologies
71% (n = 130/183) of responders thanked patient reviewers: “Thank you 
for taking the time to…” (COI 27507), and “thank you for having the courage 
to do so” (COI 230306). 73.6% (n = 104/141) of responders also offered 
an apology (factor 10). Some (40.4%, n = 42/104) adopted inclusive 
pronoun use, that is “we are very sorry to hear…” (COI 80348), while the 
majority (58.65%, n = 61/104) of responders accepted more individual-
ized responsibility, that is “I’m very sorry to hear…” (COI 222703). One 
responder adopted the pronoun “our.” Additional reasons for apologies 
included not being able to offer a more detailed response, and for de-
lays in response times “I apologise for the delay in responding but I had to 
have my access rights reset after some leave” (COI 308835).
Where applicable (positive, n = 43; mixed, n = 11), 74.1% 
(n = 40/54) of responders offered to forward on positive feedback, 
a central feature of patient response satisfaction (factor 9; Table 1). 
For example, “Dear Doricigirl, thank you for your kind comments…. As re-
quested, I have fed back your comments to the Maternity Teams…” (COI 
321922). Staff morale and learning benefits associated with this action 
were also highlighted by several responders: “Thank you so much for 
taking the time to give your positive feedback…. I will pass your thoughts 
on to the staff… as it means a lot to staff when people appreciate their ef-
forts and hard work” (COI 157625); and “We always welcome comments 
regarding experiences… as it helps us to identify problems and improve 
the quality of our service and care” (COI 139286). However, one identi-
fied limitation of the valued anonymization of patient stories was the 
inability to pass on positive praise in line with patient wishes. For ex-
ample, “We can share your thanks with staff members directly involved, if 
you would like us to do this, we will need a little more specific information 
from you” (COI 173372).
3.4.5 | Response content
76.5% (n = 140/183) of responses appeared to tailor their response. 
Figure 4 provides an example of a “standardized” and tailored re-
sponse perceived as particularly poor/good by participants. These 
fulfil 1/18 and 12/18 factors, respectively, due to their negative cat-
egorization, that is factor of offers to pass positive feedback on not 
applicable. Fulfilled factors are colour- 
coordinated with the seven 
subject areas identified in Figure 2.
3.4.6 | Signposting
Over two- 
thirds (92.2%, n = 130/141) of responses signposted other 
services (factor 14; Table 1). This was primarily the Patient Advice 
and Liaison Service (PALS) (73.9%, n = 96/130). However, only one 
responder provided an explanation for the proposed service (factor 
15; Table 1), with many assuming existing patient awareness and un-
derstanding. However, some areas of good practice are clearly dem-
onstrated (COI 206461). Furthermore, the efficiency and suitability of 
PALS was questioned by many patient reviewers. Ensuring signposted 
service efficiency is therefore also key to maintaining patient response 
satisfaction.

Closely aligned to signposting relevant services was the provision of 
opening times, multiple contact options and named personnel. Of the 
relevant responses analysed (negative, n = 129; mixed, n = 11), 66.6% 
(n = 94/141) provided more than one contact option, primarily telephone 
numbers and email addresses (factor 18; Table 1). However, less than 
one- 
fifth of responses provided a named person and their corresponding 
contact details (17.8%, n = 25/141), a criterion deemed essential from 
a patient perspective (factor 16; Table 1). Even fewer (5.7%, n = 8/141) 
provided opening times for signposted services (factor 17; Table 1).
3.4.7 | Sign- 
off
Finally, over half of responses were considered to be signed off in 
a polite manner (59%, n = 108/183), for example “Best wishes” (COI 
248529); “with kind regards” (331704); and “thank you once again” 
(COI 173372).
4 | DISCUSSION
This research advances existing understanding by providing previ-
ously unavailable guidance on how to effectively respond to patient 
feedback in an online environment.5,6,23,24 Informed by principles 
of collaborative working,14 this research identified 19 factors con-
sidered influential in effective organizational responses from a 
patient perspective. It identifies effective responses as those that 
address the feedback provider; introduce the responder through 
the provision of their name, role and picture; provide an accessible

explanation of their role; offer thanks and apologies where appro-
priate; respond within seven days; and provide uniquely tailored 
response content that includes a named contact, opening times 
and multiple contact methods for signposted services.
Quality appraisal of existing responses identifies a clear need 
for existing response methods to be refined. For example, provid-
ing contact details, opening times and a named person contact 
for signposted services occurred in less than 6% of responses re-
viewed despite their perceived importance from a patient perspec-
tive. Research findings indicate a current misalignment between 
patient aspirations and response practice, helping to explain previ-
ous reports of patient response dissatisfaction.5
When discussed in line with justice theory, a multifaceted con-
struct encompassing three dimensions frequently used in business 
and hospitality sectors to understand feedback processes,5,6 a 
theoretically robust understanding of reported results can be de-
veloped. For example, procedural justice refers to the perceived fair-
ness of policies and procedures used by responding organizations 
of which the concept of voice and neutrality appears key. Similar to 
consumers, patients appreciate the opportunity to have their voice 
heard.5 The rapid growth of eWOM platforms such as Care Opinion 
and others globally provides such an opportunity. However, their 
associated benefits can be restricted by problems associated with 
neutrality—the degree to which their processes appear scripted or

“standardized.”5,6 As demonstrated by participants in this research, 
patients are quick to detect “standardized” or “meaningless” re-
sponses, often leading to feelings of frustration and dissatisfaction. 
The patient- 
generated criterion reported in this study of providing a 
uniquely tailored response that demonstrates that the responder has 
actively listened to a patient’s experience is a direct response to this 
unfavourable approach. Other aspects of procedural justice relate 
to timely response efforts. Our research highlights the importance 
of rapid responses (within seven days, although three is desirable) 
in facilitating favourable perceptions of organizations, perceived re-
sponsiveness and sensitivity of organizations concerned.
The second dimension of justice theory relates to the manner in 
which individuals are treated during the response process (interac-
tional justice).5 Our research strongly suggests responses need to 
provide appropriate explanations, be made accessible to patients 
and be presented in a polite, empathic manner facilitated by assur-
ance, honesty and respect. Due to the acknowledged importance 
of communication in organizational responses,13 the concept of in-
teractional justice appears particularly relevant to understanding 
response perceptions and reactions.12 Finally, distributive justice 
refers to compensation evaluation.5 In most instances, feedback 
related to health- 
care services is considered “unrecoverable”; that 
is, simply reperforming the service is not possible.5 Reasons behind 
patient feedback submission in this context often therefore involve 
more egocentric exchanges such as apologies or reassurance.5 
Contrary to medicolegal concerns,5 none of the patient stories re-
viewed referred to monetary compensation.5 Stories reviewed typ-
ically focused on more egocentric compensations such as service 
failure prevention for other patients, and improving existing services 
for others. These may be important motivators to consider when try-
ing to encourage patients to share their feedback. Other egocentric 
motivations identified also importantly included the forwarding- 
on 
of positive patient feedback expressing praise and gratitude for ser-
vices received—a desirable and motivational aim often overlooked in 
existing research. The beneficial impacts of receiving positive feed-
back should not be undermined.
Following this, our research findings raise important practical 
and theoretical implications. Firstly, why less than 2% of patient sto-
ries may lead to a possible change warrants further investigation, 
as does the high proportion of stories not yet responded to at the 
time of analysis. Patient feedback can only be acted on if it is ac-
knowledged and heard. As stated by Coulter et al, to ignore patient 
experience data, particularly when asked, is unethical.25 Continuing 
to ignore such information would only be to the detriment of pa-
tient safety and quality of care. As acknowledged in the difficulties 
of forwarding on positive feedback, it remains unclear whether a 
lack of self- 
reported change is related to problems in data collection 
methods, for example detail specificity, or wider professional and or-
ganizational cultural issues that inhibit patient feedback acceptance 
and subsequent action.26,27 If it is an issue of nuanced detail, then 
collection methods and their structures/guidance may need to be 
revised to facilitate this process. Alternatively, if it is an issue of cul-
ture, then ways of resolving this are needed as the sharing of patient 
experience is becoming an inevitable component of quality improve-
ment internationally.1-4 Other implications of this research include 
the possibility to enhance response quality and subsequent quality 
improvement initiatives by following the collaboratively designed 
“Plymouth Listen, Learn and Respond” (PLLR) framework. This in 
turn may help to diffuse patient anger, prevent further complaint 
behaviour and alleviate any immediate sense of injustice caused.9 
Further research into this area is desirable. While designed for on-
line environments, identified factors could also apply “offline,” al-
though further investigation into this issue is required. Importantly, 
identified areas for improvement are considered “fixable and not in-
surmountable” (H.C. member 8). Organizations and individual practi-
tioners should therefore be able to strengthen their response quality 
with relative ease. While factors identified as influential may repre-
sent limited associated costs, the power of high- 
quality responses 
to act as drivers for organizational learning, quality improvement 
and patient empowerment should not be underestimated. As one 
Care Opinion reviewer states: “I felt empowered and understood and 
believed and respected…which is all I ever needed in the first place” 
(182221). Commitment to strengthening response processes is 
therefore actively encouraged.
4.1 | Strengths and limitations
Strengths of this research include its application of a systematic 
search; inclusion of online feedback; development of an innovative 
response framework in collaboration with a patient- 
research- 
partner 
and patient- 
carer group; inclusion of a seldom-heard population—
mental health; and unique application of justice theory to understand 
online responses in a health- 
care setting. Extensive patient involve-
ment throughout the process revealed unique insight into patient re-
actions and perceptions of organizational responses. Without such 
involvement, factors identified as influential may have continued to 
be under- 
reported and therefore excluded in future quality improve-
ment developments. For example, the importance of providing more 
than one contact option due to the anxiety involved in phoning an 
unnamed individual raised by the patient- 
research- 
partner and oth-
ers may not be something at the forefront of professional minds with 
limited mental health experience. Feedback interventions are typi-
cally developed from a professional perspective only, despite the 
acknowledged difference between professional and patient experi-
ences or desires.15,28,29 The active involvement of patients in this 
research has therefore been imperative.
However, its limitations must also be acknowledged. Presented 
data represent a subsample of responses from one, although large, 
geographical area from one website. The need for further research 
in collaboration with patient- 
research- 
partners to explore poten-
tial cultural or demographic differences is therefore acknowledged. 
However, similar methodological restraints of single geographi-
cal areas are also reported in previous research,18 and should not 
undermine the practicality of the proposed framework. Other re-
search limitations include the involvement of a small number of 
patient participants during the development stage, amalgamation 
     |  897

of patient and carer perceptions, and an inability to assess original 
patient response satisfaction and motivation for providing patient 
feedback due to patient anonymity. Despite these limitations, as re-
ported in previous research,30 it is anticipated that by developing 
and piloting the “PLLR” in a typically “hard-to-reach” population,19 
the transferability of our research findings may be enhanced. While 
acknowledging the need for further research that addresses identi-
fied limitations, the conceptual framework proposed may also be ap-
plicable to other related fields outside of mental health due to their 
correlation with other literatures including business, hospitality and 
customer care.9,23,31
5 | CONCLUSION
This research advances existing knowledge by collaboratively design-
ing a patient feedback response framework from the patient perspec-
tive. It provides previously unavailable guidance on how to effectively 
respond to patient feedback online leading to clear practical and 
theoretical implications for those looking to listen to, learn from and 
respond to the patient voice in “real time.” By understanding patient 
perceptions of organizational responses, those responsible for devel-
oping and implementing response policies may be able to focus more 
precisely on factors considered important in effective organizational 
responses. This in turn could help health- 
care services to develop 
more effective methods leading to enhanced response quality, patient 
safety and quality of care. To achieve this, organizations and providers 
must begin to align their response processes with patient aspirations 
and desires. By doing so, the invaluable learning opportunities attrib-
uted to patient experience can begin to be realized.
