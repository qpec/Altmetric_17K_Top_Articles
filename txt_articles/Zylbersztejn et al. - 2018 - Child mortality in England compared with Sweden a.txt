Child mortality in England compared with Sweden: a birth 
cohort study
Ania Zylbersztejn, Ruth Gilbert, Anders Hjern, Linda Wijlaars, Pia Hardelid
Summary
Background Child mortality is almost twice as high in England compared with Sweden. We aimed to establish the 
extent to which adverse birth characteristics and socioeconomic factors explain this difference.
Methods We developed nationally representative cohorts of singleton livebirths between Jan 1, 2003, and Dec 31, 2012, 
using the Hospital Episode Statistics in England, and the Swedish Medical Birth Register in Sweden, with longitudinal 
follow-up from linked hospital admissions and mortality records. We analysed mortality as the outcome, based on 
deaths from any cause at age 2–27 days, 28–364 days, and 1–4 years. We fitted Cox proportional hazard regression 
models to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) for England compared with Sweden in all three age groups. The models 
were adjusted for birth characteristics (gestational age, birthweight, sex, and congenital anomalies), and for 
socioeconomic factors (maternal age and socioeconomic status).
Findings The English cohort comprised 3 932 886 births and 11 392 deaths and the Swedish cohort comprised 
1 013 360 births and 1927 deaths. The unadjusted HRs for England compared with Sweden were 1∙66 (95% CI 
1∙53–1∙81) at 2–27 days, 1∙59 (1∙47–1∙71) at 28–364 days, and 1∙27 (1∙15–1∙40) at 1–4 years. At 2–27 days, 77% of the 
excess risk of death in England was explained by birth characteristics and a further 3% by socioeconomic factors. At 
28–364 days, 68% of the excess risk of death in England was explained by birth characteristics and a further 11% by 
socioeconomic factors. At 1–4 years, the adjusted HR did not indicate a significant difference between countries.
Interpretation Excess child mortality in England compared with Sweden was largely explained by the unfavourable 
distribution of birth characteristics in England. Socioeconomic factors contributed to these differences through 
associations with adverse birth characteristics and increased mortality after 1 month of age. Policies to reduce child 
mortality in England could have most impact by reducing adverse birth characteristics through improving the health 
of women before and during pregnancy and reducing socioeconomic disadvantage.

Introduction
The UK has one of the highest child mortality rates in 
western Europe. In 2013, mortality in children aged less 
than 5 years was 4∙9 per 1000 births in the UK, which was 
around 25% higher compared with France, Germany, 
Italy, or Spain, and almost twice as high compared with 
Sweden (2∙7 per 1000 births).1 As both the UK and Sweden 
have comparable standards of economic development and 
universal health care, Sweden is often viewed as a 
benchmark for reductions in child mortality that should 
be achievable in the UK.2–5
Policy makers and child health professionals have called 
for improvements in child health services to reduce child 
mortality in the UK relative to Sweden, including more 
efficient general practitioner (GP) responses to sick 
children through better integration of GP and paediatric 
services and enhanced training.2,4,5 However, the higher 
rate of child mortality in the UK could also reflect a higher 
prevalence of risk factors at birth, such as prematurity, 
low birthweight, and congenital anomalies,2,6,7 as over 
80% of deaths in children under 5 years occur before 
12 months (86% in the UK and 81% in Sweden in 2013).1 
An unequal distribution of wealth in the UK’s society has 
also been reported to contribute to the high observed 
child mortality.2,5,7–9
Policy makers need evidence from a comparison of 
child mortality between the UK and Sweden that accounts 
for between-country differences in birth characteristics 
(including birthweight, gestational age, and congenital 
anomalies) and socioeconomic circumstances to guide 
policies to reduce child mortality. Such evidence could 
inform policy decisions on whether to focus preventive 
strategies on health care for children after birth or on 
improving the health of women before and during 
pregnancy to reduce risk factors present at birth.
We compared child mortality in England, which 
accounts for 85% of all births in the UK,10 and Sweden 
using individual-level, national administrative health

databases. We aimed to identify how much of the 
increase in child mortality in England compared with 
Sweden is explained by differences in prevalence of 
adverse birth characteristics and socioeconomic factors 
operating after birth.
Methods
Study design and participants
In this population-based birth cohort study, we developed 
nationally representative birth cohorts using birth records 
linked to hospital admission data and mortality registration 
databases in England and Sweden. These databases 
captured 97% of all births and 98–99% of all hospital 
admissions in England,11 and 98–99% of births12 and all 
hospital admissions in Sweden.13 The cohorts com 
prised 
singleton livebirths between Jan 1, 2003, and Dec 31, 2012, 
to resident mothers in each country. We followed up 
children until their fifth birthday, death, or Dec 31, 2013, 
whichever occurred first.
We received ethical approval to use the Swedish 
national registers from the Regional Committee of 
Stockholm (no 2016/1234-31/5; approved on Aug 4, 2016). 
We have a data sharing agreement with National Health 
Service (NHS) Digital to use a de-identified extract of 
Hospital Episode Statistics linked to Office for National 
Statistics death registration data for research on child 
mortality; therefore, we did not require ethical approval 
to use English datasets.14
In England, entry to the birth cohort was based on birth 
admissions recorded in Hospital Episode Statistics, which 
is a hospital discharge database containing all admissions 
to NHS hospitals and 97% of all births in England.11 
Hospital Episode Statistics birth records include child and 
maternal characteristics (eg, birth 
weight, gestational age, 
and maternal age). We excluded hospitals with high 
proportions of missing data or evidence of linkage error 
to address incomplete recording of risk factors at birth. We 
included hospitals with more than 500 births a year, with 
high completeness of recorded birthweight and gestational 
age, and hostpitals where at least half of all deaths were 
linked to a death certificate (see appendix for selection 
criteria). We ensured representativeness of the cohort by 
comparing distributions of birthweight, gestational age, 
and maternal age among livebirths and infant deaths 
against national statistics for England and Wales published 
by the Office for National Statistics (appendix).15,16 We 
Research in context
Evidence before the study
We searched PubMed for international comparisons of child 
mortality published from Jan 1, 2000, to Jun 30, 2017, which 
included England or the UK and Sweden in the analyses. 
We used the search terms “((England OR English OR United 
Kingdom OR UK) AND (Sweden OR Swedish))” AND “(infan* OR 
neonat* OR post-neonat* OR child OR childhood OR under-5)” 
AND “(death OR mortality OR dying OR survival)” in titles and 
abstracts, and checked reference lists of identified papers to 
find additional relevant studies. We excluded studies which only 
used data from before the year 2000, and included only studies 
in English. We identified seven studies. Global comparisons of 
trends in child mortality show that rates in the UK have 
remained almost twice those in Sweden. Potential explanations 
are the UK’s higher prevalence of preterm birth and congenital 
anomalies and that the UK has one of the most unequal 
distributions of income of all western countries. In 2003–05, 
the most deprived 20% of the population had a seven-times 
lower income than did the least deprived 20%, compared with a 
four-times difference in Sweden. Additionally, differences in 
health-care provision might contribute to increased health-care 
amenable mortality in the UK relative to Sweden. However, no 
previous study has adequate data to identify the relative 
contribution of birth characteristics or socioeconomic status to 
the excess in child mortality in the UK compared with Sweden.
Added value of this study
We developed representative birth cohorts in England and 
Sweden using individual-level administrative health databases 
with detailed information on child characteristics at birth 
(birthweight, gestational age, congenital anomalies, and sex) 
and socioeconomic factors (maternal age and socioeconomic 
status). We compared mortality in England and Sweden 
adjusted for these risk factors at birth. At 2–27 days, 77% of the 
excess mortality in England relative to Sweden was due to 
differences in birth characteristics and 3% due to an 
independent effect of socioeconomic factors. For mortality at 
28–364 days, these proportions were 68% for birth 
characteristics and 11% for socioeconomic factors. Small but 
significant differences remained after adjustment in the first 
year of life. At 1–4 years, the differences in mortality were 
negligible after adjusting for birth characteristics and 
socioeconomic factors.
Implications of all the available evidence
The largest improvements in child mortality in England relative 
to Sweden could be achieved by reducing the prevalence of low 
birthweight, prematurity, and congenital anomalies. The risk of 
child mortality in England relative to Sweden declined by 
70–80% when adjusted for birth characteristics in the 
two populations. Socioeconomic disadvantage contributes to 
child mortality through its association with adverse birth 
characteristics, and in our study socioeconomic factors 
independently led to a further 10% reduction in mortality 
beyond the first month of life. These findings suggest that the 
biggest reductions in child mortality in England relative to 
Sweden could be achieved by reducing the prevalence of 
adverse birth characteristics through universal programmes to 
improve the health of women and reduce health inequalities 
before and during pregnancy.

followed up the cohort by linking each child’s birth 
admission with subsequent hospital admissions and 
Office for National Statistics death registrations. NHS 
Digital generated a study-specific identifier (called the 
HESID) to enable us to link hospital records across 
time and with mortality records using the patient’s 
NHS number, postcode, date of birth, sex, and hospital 
patient identifier.17
In Sweden, entry to the birth cohort was based on data 
recording in the Swedish Medical Birth Register, a 
mandatory database containing details of antenatal, 
obstetric, and neonatal care for all births in Sweden to 
resident mothers.12 Singleton livebirths recorded in the 
Swedish Medical Birth Register were linked to the Swedish 
Hospital Discharge Register13 and the Swedish Cause of 
Death Register18 through each child’s study-specific 
identifier based on their unique personal identity number.19
Risk factors
Information about birthweight, gestational age, and sex 
was obtained from the Swedish Medical Birth Register and 
from Hospital Episode Statistics.11,12 In the English cohort, 
we linked the baby’s birth admissions with maternal 
delivery admissions within Hospital Episode Statistics to 
minimise missing values of birth characteristics and 
socioeconomic factors (appendix).20 The Swedish Medical 
Birth Register had near complete recording of the risk 
factors in this study.
We categorised gestational age as 24–27 weeks, 
28–31 weeks, 32–34 weeks, 35–36 weeks, 37–38 weeks, and 
39 weeks and longer, and birthweight as 500–999 g, 
1000–1499 g, 1500–2499 g, 2500–3499 g, and 3500 g and 
higher. To minimise bias from intercountry differences in 
recording of stillbirths and early neonatal deaths, we 
excluded all babies weighing less than 500 g at birth or 
born at less than 24 weeks of gestation in both England 
and Sweden.21,22 We categorised children as having a 
congenital anomaly if they had any relevant International 
Class 
ification of Diseases version 10 codes recorded at 
birth, during any admission before 2 years of age, or on a 
death certificate as any cause of death, using a subgroup of 
codes from a list of chronic conditions in children.23
No directly comparable measure of socioeconomic status 
was available in the two countries. Instead, in Sweden we 
used quintiles of disposable household income in the year 
before childbirth, obtained via linkage to the Longitudinal 
Integration Database for Health Insurance and Labour 
Market Studies.24 In England, we used quintiles of the 
Index of Multiple Deprivation score, a small area indicator 
measured per 200–1400 house 
holds.11 Index of Multiple 
Deprivation scores were allocated using the child’s 
postcode recorded at birth (on admission of the baby or 
mother), or in hospital admissions during infancy.
As young maternal age (<20 years) is strongly associ 
ated 
with social disadvantage25 it can be used as an additional 
comparable indicator of socioeconomic status. Maternal 
age was recorded in the Swedish Medical Birth Register 
and in birth and delivery admission records in Hospital 
Episode Statistics, and was categorised as less than 
20 years, 20–24 years, 25–29 years, 30–34 years, 35–39 years, 
and 40 years and older.
Outcomes
We analysed mortality as the outcome, based on deaths 
from any cause at age 2–27 days, 28–364 days, and 
1–4 years. We excluded deaths on days 0–1 because of 
under-reporting of risk factors at birth for these deaths in 
the English cohort (appendix) and to minimise bias from 
intercountry differences in recording of stillbirths and 
early neonatal deaths.
Statistical analysis
We derived the numbers and proportions of livebirths and 
deaths according to each birth characteristic (birthweight, 
gestational age, sex, and congential anomalies) and

socioeconomic factor (maternal age and socioeconomic 
status) in England and Sweden. We calculated unadjusted 
mortality rates per 100 000 child-years by country and each 
risk factor category. We plotted Kaplan-Meier failure 
curves to illustrate between-country differences in the 
distribution of deaths by age, according to gestational age 
and presence of congenital anomalies. For each plot, 
we calculated the number of excess deaths in England 
relative to Sweden by multiplying the number of 
single 
ton livebirths in all of England (before applying ex-
clusion criteria) between Jan 1, 2003, and Dec 31, 2012 
(n=6 100 404), by the difference in the proportion of 
children who died in England and Sweden (by their 
first and fifth birthdays). We also listed the ten most 
common congenital anomalies recorded in hospital 
records and death certificates in each country.
We fitted Cox proportional hazards regression models 
to estimate hazard ratios (HRs), comparing mortality in 
England relative to Sweden (the baseline). We fitted 
separate models for deaths at 2–27 days, 28–364 days, 
and 1–4 years. We first fitted unadjusted models 
including only country of birth. We then added birth 
characteristics and socioeconomic factors a priori. To 
estimate the extent to which the differences in birth 
characteristics and socioeconomic factors contributed to 
the increased risk of death in England relative to Sweden, 
we calculated the percentage of excess risk mediated 
(abbreviated as PERM)26,27 and split it into two 
components as follows: 
where
and
Percentage of excess risk mediated was calculated only for 
models with a statistically significant adjusted HR for 
England compared with Sweden, when the Wald test result 
for the country parameter was p<0·05. For all models, the 
proportional hazards assumption was assessed using 
Schoenfeld residual plots.28
As England and Sweden might differ in the recording 
of congenital anomalies, we used a stricter definition, 
indicating only severe congenital anomalies in 
sensitivity analyses.29 We also fitted additional Cox 
proportional hazards regression models, including an 
effect modification term with age for congenital 
anomaly, for models where the proportional hazards 
assumption was not met. We used Stata MP version 14.2 
for all analyses.

Results
The English cohort comprised 3 932 886 births and 
11 392 deaths and the Swedish cohort comprised 
1 013 360 births and 1927 deaths (figure 1). This 
represented 64∙5% of all singleton livebirths and 
58∙4% of all deaths in children aged 2 days to 4 years in 
England, and 99∙8% of all singleton livebirths and 
91∙7% of all deaths in children aged 2 days to 4 years in 
Sweden.
In general, children born in England weighed less at 
birth and were born at earlier gestational ages than were 
children born in Sweden (table 1). In England, more 
children were born with congenital anomalies compared 
with Sweden, but the types of anomalies recorded were 
similar in the two countries (appendix). There were four 
times more mothers aged younger than 20 years in 
England compared with Sweden.
The unadjusted child mortality rate was almost twice as 
high in England compared with Sweden (table 2), account-
ing for about 607 excess deaths per year at 2 days to 4 years 
of age in England (6073 in total in 2003–12; figure 2). 
Unadjusted mortality rates were highest for high risk 
groups (eg, gestational age 24–27 weeks, birthweight 
500–1499 g, and those with congenital anomalies; table 2), 
but absolute numbers of excess deaths in England were 
largest for low risk but high prevalence birth 
characteristics, such as birth at full term, and for children 
born with congenital anomalies (figure 2).
Disparities in child mortality by socioeconomic 
status were wider in England than in Sweden (figure 3); 
however, the area-level socioeconomic status indicator in 
England and individual-level socioeconomic status 
indicator in Sweden were not directly comparable. We 
found significant between-country differences for all 
levels of socioeconomic status, apart from the least 
deprived 20% of children (table 2). Mortality rates by 
maternal age showed similar patterns in the two countries 
(figure 3). However, mortality rates were higher in 
England than in Sweden for all maternal age groups 
(table 2).

At 2–27 days of age, the unadjusted HR for England 
relative to Sweden was 1∙66 (95% CI 1∙53–1∙81; table 3). 
After adjustment for birth characteristics, the HR for 
country decreased to 1∙15 (1∙06–1∙25), and further 
adjustment for socioeconomic factors reduced the HR to 
1∙13 (1∙04–1∙23). Between-country differences in the 
distribution of birth characteristics explained 77% of the 
excess risk of death in England relative to Sweden. A 
further 3% was explained by socioeconomic factors, over 
and above their effect on birth characteristics. In the fully 
adjusted model (for birth characteristics and socioeconomic 
factors), birthweight less than 1500 g, gestational age less 
than 28 weeks, and congenital anomalies were associated 
with the highest risk of death at 2–27 days (appendix).
At 28–364 days, the unadjusted HR for England relative 
to Sweden was 1∙59 (95% CI 1∙47–1∙71; table 3). The HR 
decreased to 1∙19 (1∙10–1∙28) after adjustment for birth 
characteristics, and to 1∙12 (1∙04–1∙21) after adjustment 
for socioeconomic factors. Between-country differences 
in the distribution of birth characteristics accounted for 
68% of the excess risk of death in England relative to 
Sweden, and socioeconomic factors independently 
explained a further 11%. In the fully adjusted model, the 
highest risk of death at 28–364 days was associated with 
the presence of a congenital anomaly and birthweight 
less than 1500 g (appendix).
At 1–4 years, the unadjusted HR for England relative to 
Sweden was 1∙27 (95% CI 1∙15–1∙40; table 3). The HR 
dropped to 1∙10 (1∙00–1∙22) after adjustment for birth 
characteristics. After further adjustment for socio

of a congenital anomaly was the single most important 
risk factor for death at 1–4 years in the fully adjusted model, 
increasing the risk of death by 17 times, followed by low 
birthweight (<2500 g) with a four times increase 
(appendix).
The results did not change appreciably in sensitivity 
analyses using an indicator for severe congenital anomaly 
(appendix), or when we included an effect modification 
term with age for congenital anomaly to meet the 
proportional hazard assumption (appendix).
Discussion
Child mortality was substantially higher at all ages 
in England compared with Sweden; however, birth 
characteristics largely explained the increased risk of 
death. Differences in the distribution of birth char-
acteristics accounted for 77% of the excess risk of death 
in England at 2–27 days and 68% at 28–364 days. 
Socioeconomic factors accounted for a further 3% of the 
increased risk of death in England relative to Sweden at 
2–27 days and 11% at 28–364 days, independent of birth 
characteristics. A small but significantly increased risk of 
death in the first year of life in England remained after 
adjustment for birth characteristics and socio 
economic 
factors. However, differences in mortality beyond the first 
year of life were negligible in the fully adjusted model.
A strength of our study was the use of nationally 
representative birth cohorts, with detailed birth character-
istics and linkage to all hospital admission records and 
death registrations up to 4 completed years of age. Child 
deaths are rare, but the large sample of individual-level 
data enabled us to investigate associations for low 
prevalence risk factors, such as congenital anomalies and 
extreme prematurity, both alone and in combination. Our 
results were robust to all sensitivity analyses. Our 
approach to inter-country comparisons overcomes the 
limitations of using aggregate data and could serve as a 
model for future international comparisons of child 
mortality and other health outcomes in countries with 
electronic health records.
A limitation of this study is the quality of data in England. 
We excluded a third of births because of incomplete 
Figure 2: Mortality at 2 days to 4 years in England and Sweden, overall and by selected risk factors at birth
We calculated excess deaths at 1 year and 5 years by multiplying the number of births in the English cohort based on all births (n=6 100 404) by the difference in proportion of children who died by their first 
or fifth birthday in England and Sweden. Probability of death is only presented for one risk factor at a time. ED=excess death.

recording of birth characteristics in the hospital admission 
database. We therefore based our analyses on a rep-
resentative subgroup of births in England, validated 
against national statistics. A national birth cohort with 
almost 100% completeness of risk factors at birth and high 
quality of linkage to mortality data could be developed by 
linking Office for National Statistics birth registration, 
NHS birth notification data, and Hospital Episode 
Statistics records for mothers and babies in England. The 
feasibility of such linkage has been shown previously.30,31
Another limitation of our study is that we excluded 
deaths occurring on days 0 and 1 of life because of 
missing data on risk factors in England and to minimise 
bias due to inter-country differences in classification of 
stillbirths and livebirths. Deaths on days 0 and 1 of life 
accounted for around a quarter of deaths in children 
aged less than 5 years in England and Sweden. Adverse 
birth characteristics are key determinants of mortality in 
the first week of life,32 and we showed that their 
prevalence is higher in England than in Sweden. 
Therefore, our results probably underestimate the 
contribution of adverse birth characteristics to the 
increased risk of neonatal mortality in England compared 
with Sweden. Further comparisons, including both 
stillbirths and livebirths (to allow for between-country 
differences in definitions and mortality registration 
practices), are needed to confirm this hypothesis. 
Comparisons based on all livebirths and stillbirths would 
also minimise the so-called livebirth bias, which arises 
when the same prenatal exposures are associated with 
the outcome of interest (here child mortality) and the risk 
of fetal death.33
A third limitation of our study is the use of different 
measures 
for 
socioeconomic 
status 
in 
England 
(an area-level indicator) and Sweden (an individual-level 
indicator of household income). Maternal education is 
the most comparable and consistent socioeconomic 
status indicator for international studies of child health 
outcomes,34,35 but such data are not available in England. 
Furthermore, we only accounted for the effect of 
socioeconomic factors on excess child mortality in 
England relative to Sweden, independent of birth

characteristics. Further comparisons using causal 
mediation methods are needed to establish the total 
contribution of socioeconomic factors to increased child 
mortality in England relative to Sweden (ie, including 
both the effect mediated by low birthweight, preterm 
birth, and congenital anomalies, and the direct effect).
Our study would have benefited from analysis of 
additional maternal risk factors, such as smoking during 
pregnancy and body-mass index (BMI), which are 
recorded in the Swedish Medical Birth Register,12 but not 
in any national birth or maternity datasets in England. 
We could not establish the contribution of ethnicity to the 
differences in child mortality between England and 
Sweden. Ethnic group data are collected in England using 
a UK-specific categorisation, and comparable ethnic 
group information is not collected in Sweden. However, 
the mother’s country of birth is recorded both in the 
Swedish Medical Birth Register12 and Office for National 
Statistics birth registration.31 Further work could explore 
differences in infant and child mortality according to the 
immigration history of mothers in the different health 
and social policy contexts of England and Sweden.
Disparities in child mortality rates in England compared 
with Sweden were largely driven by differences in 
distribution of birth characteristics in the two countries. 
A child’s birth characteristics are associated with maternal 
characteristics, health, and socioeconomic circumstances 
before and during pregnancy. For example, young or old 
maternal age, smoking during pregnancy, and obesity are 
associated with increased prevalence of preterm birth,36–38 
intrauterine growth restriction,37,38 and some congenital 
anomalies.39 Prevalence of many of these factors is higher 
in England than in Sweden. For example, prevalence of 
smoking during pregnancy is almost twice as high in 
England as in Sweden (12% vs 6·5% in 2010), and a 
higher proportion of women are obese (in 2010, one in 
five women in England had a BMI ≥30 kg/m² vs one in 
eight in Sweden).32,40 Therefore, policies to reduce child 
mortality in England need to focus on improving 
maternal health before and during pregnancy.
Efforts to reduce the prevalence of adverse birth 
characteristics would not only reduce child mortality, 
but could improve many other serious and more 
prevalent health problems. Preterm birth and low 
birthweight are associated with increased risk of chronic 
illness (such as cerebral palsy or sensory impairment),41–44 
respiratory illness,43 and mental health problems.45 
Growing evidence for associations with low educational 
attainment41–43 and increased risk of long-term adult 
health outcomes, including cardiovascular disease, 
hypertension, and diabetes, has been found.43,46 Our 
findings support recommendations made by others46,47 
that the benefits from investing limited public resources 
to improve maternal health before and during pregnancy 
have lifelong health benefits for a substantial proportion 
of the population, far exceeding the number of children 
who stand to benefit by reducing child mortality.
Further research needs to focus on differences in the 
prevalence of adverse birth characteristics within each 
country according to maternal health indicators (eg, 
obesity, infections, or presence of chronic conditions such 
as diabetes or hypertensive disorders), health behaviours 
(smoking, drug or alcohol use during pregnancy, and 
nutrition), ethnic group, and measures of health 
inequalities and socioeconomic disadvantage of the 
mother to evaluate policy interventions to improve 
maternal health and reduce adverse birth characteristics. 
Welfare policies that reduce socioeconomic disparities in 
England should be an important part of a strategy to lower 
child mortality in England. Socioeconomic dis 
advantage is 
an important determinant of preterm birth,48,49 low 
birthweight,48,49 presence of congenital anomalies,50 and 
associated maternal risk factors, operating upstream 
through the responses and behaviours of mothers exposed 
to poverty, stress, and financial hardship.48 The UK has a 
higher proportion of children living in relative poverty 
(12·1% vs 7·3% in Sweden in 2009) or in deprived 
households (5·5% vs 1·3% in Sweden in 2009).51 Our study 
also found that teenage mothers, who are more likely to 
come from deprived backgrounds,25 accounted for four 
times more births in England than in Sweden. Therefore, 
the increased prevalence of adverse birth char 
acteristics in 
England could at least partly be attributed to a larger 
population being exposed to socioeconomic dis 
advantage.
Some of the increased prevalence of congenital 
anomalies in England might be attributable to diff

in provision of prenatal care. For example, the number of 
terminations of pregnancies is higher in Sweden than in 
England because of more terminations for women aged 
35 years and older (numbers are comparable for women 
aged <20 years)52 and screening for chromosomal 
anomalies.53 These differences could reflect differing 
cultural attitudes to termination of pregnancy, in timing 
of detection of the anomaly (ultrasound scan is offered at 
15–18 weeks in Sweden compared with 18–21 weeks in 
England),54 or in uptake of the scan; in 2016, more than 
90% of women attended antenatal care before 20 weeks of 
pregnancy in both countries, but more than 95% of 
women in Sweden had an ultrasound scan compared 
with an estimated 75–95% in England and Wales.55
Further research is needed to identify the origins of the 
small but significant differences in the risk of death, 
which remained after adjustment for characteristics at 
birth and socioeconomic factors. First, some of these 
differences could reflect variation in the prevalence or 
severity of chronic conditions not measured in our study 
that are associated with increased mortality (such as 
cerebral palsy). Second, differences between England and 
Sweden might reflect differences in family policy between 
these countries. For example, both provide comparable 
amounts of universal child benefit;56,57 however, in Sweden 
parents are also offered affordable, subsidised day care56 
and longer paid parental leave (combined 70 weeks 
compared with 41 weeks in the UK).58 Differences in 
provision of health care could also contribute to these 
small remaining differences.56,57 However, our results 
point to mech 
anisms outside health-care services as 
being much more important.
The increased child mortality in England relative to 
Sweden was largely explained by differences in the 
distribution of birth characteristics between the 
two countries. Adverse birth characteristics are strongly 
associated with maternal health. Therefore, the largest 
reductions in child mortality in England relative to 
Sweden could be achieved through universal pro-
grammes to improve the health of women and reduce 
health inequalities before and during pregnancy.
