Abstract
Mobile phones and Wi-Fi radiofrequency radiation are among the main sources of the exposure of the general population to
radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMF). Previous studies have shown that exposure of microorganisms to RF-EMFs can
be associated with a wide spectrum of changes ranged from the modified bacterial growth to the alterations of the pattern of
antibiotic resistance. Our laboratory at the nonionizing department of the Ionizing and Non-ionizing Radiation Protection
Research Center has performed experiments on the health effects of exposure to animal models and humans to different sources
of electromagnetic fields such as cellular phones, mobile base stations, mobile phone jammers, laptop computers, radars, dentistry
cavitrons, magnetic resonance imaging, and Helmholtz coils. On the other hand, we have previously studied different aspects of
the challenging issue of the ionizing or nonionizing radiation-induced alterations in the susceptibility of microorganisms to
antibiotics. In this study, we assessed if the exposure to 900 MHz GSM mobile phone radiation and 2.4 GHz radiofrequency
radiation emitted from common Wi-Fi routers alters the susceptibility of microorganisms to different antibiotics. The pure
cultures of Listeria monocytogenes and Escherichia coli were exposed to RF-EMFs generated either by a GSM 900 MHz mobile phone
simulator and a common 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi router. It is also shown that exposure to RF-EMFs within a narrow level of irradiation (an
exposure window) makes microorganisms resistant to antibiotics. This adaptive phenomenon and its potential threats to human
health should be further investigated in future experiments. Altogether, the findings of this study showed that exposure to Wi-Fi
and RF simulator radiation can significantly alter the inhibition zone diameters and growth rate for L monocytogenes and E coli.
These findings may have implications for the management of serious infectious diseases.

 Introduction
Antibiotic resistance is one of the most important threats to
global health.1 According to World Health Organization, this
problem is rising dangerously to high levels worldwide, which
leads to longer hospitalization, higher medical costs, and raised
mortality.2
Bacteria are becoming resistant to almost all commonly
available antibiotics and this is a worldwide problem.1 Today,
greater use of telecommunication technologies like Global Sys-
tem for Mobile communication (GSM), cordless phones,
mobile base stations, wireless personal, and local area net-
works, such as bluetooth, has led to ever increasing exposure
to radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMF).3 There-
fore, living organisms are now being exposed to microwaves
and radiofrequency radiation signals from various sources.4
The effects of these radiations on the biological functions of
living cells shows an emerging area of interest in human health
with respect to environmental effects.5 Several studies were
conducted to confirm the effects of electromagnetic radiation
on cell functions6-8; however, the findings obtained in these
studies were controversial. In particular, it was proven that
EMF can affect functional parameters (cell growth and antimi-
crobial susceptibility).9-12
Listeria monocytogenes is a gram-positive, facultative anae-
robe, nonspore-forming, motile, and rod-shaped bacterium.13
In 1952, it was recognized as the main cause of neonatal infec-
tion, meningitis, and sepsis.14 Listeria infection in adult
patients is related to immunocompromised systems like HIV
infection,15 organ transplants, individuals who have received
corticosteroids, and immunosuppressant drugs for their malig-
nancies. Escherichia coli known as E coli, a gram-negative,
rod-shaped, facultatively anaerobic bacterium,16 is a common
cause of life-threatening infections such as bloodstream and
urinary tract infections, otitis media, and other complications.17
Our laboratory at the nonionizing department of the Ionizing
and Non-ionizing Radiation Protection Research Center has
performed experiments on the health effects of exposure to
animal models and humans to different sources of electromag-
netic fields such as cellular phones,18-20 mobile base stations,21
mobile phone jammers,22,23 laptop computers,24 radars,25 den-
tistry cavitrons,26 magnetic resonance imaging,27,28 and Helm-
holtz coils.29,30 In this study, we assessed whether the exposure
to 900 MHz and 2.4 GHz RF-EMF emitted from GSM and a
common Wi-Fi router could change the susceptibility of micro-
organisms to different antibiotics.
Materials and Methods
Antibiotic Susceptibility Test
In the current study, L monocytogenes ATCC 19115 was used
and E coli strain was isolated from patients in Faghihi hospital,
Shiraz, Iran. Escherichia coli strain was characterized by con-
ventional methods including morphological and biochemical
tests and confirmed using API 20 E method. The pure cultures
of L monocytogenes and E coli were diluted in Mueller-Hinton
Broth to reach 0.5 McFarland turbidity standards to get 1.5
� 108 CFU/mL as the total count.31 Bacterial suspensions
were spread on plates and cultured with a set of 6 antimi-
crobial substances; they were tested by disk diffusion
method (Kirby-Bauer method) on Mueller-Hinton agar
(MHA-Biolife, Italy) plates and E coli ATCC 25922 was
used as the quality control for antibiotic susceptibility tests,
according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute
guidelines (CLSI, 2013). The incubation period was 18 to
24 hours at 35�C, and then inhibition zones for each disk
were measured.
Antimicrobial Agents
Antibiotics used for E coli tests were imipenem (10 mg), levo-
floxacin (LEVO 5 mg), aztreonam (30 mg), ciprofloxacin (CIPR
5 mg), cefotaxime (CTX 30 mg), and piperacillin (100 mg).
Listeria monocytogenes tests were conducted using doxycy-
cline (DOX 30 mg), sulfamethoxazole–trimethoprim (SXT
25 mg), LEVO 5mg, CTX 30 mg, CIPR 5 mg, and ceftriaxone
(CTR 30 mg) antibiotics.
All antibiotic disks were purchased from ROSCO Diagnos-
tica (DK-2630 Taastrup, Denmark). Results of antibiotic sus-
ceptibility tests before and after exposure to either Wi-Fi or
GSM mobile phone radiation were measured and analyzed. The
inhibition zone of each plate was recorded as the average of at
least 2 different measurements (in millimeters). Three replicate
agar plates were used for each regime, according to CLSI
guidelines (2013).
Wi-Fi Router
A D-Link Wi-Fi router (D-Link, D-Link Corporation, Taiwan)
was used in this study as the exposure source. During the expo-
sure period, data were exchanged between the modem and a
laptop computer that was placed in another room (5 m away
from the Wi-Fi router).
The Wi-Fi router operated with a power level of 1 W and the
specific absorption rate at the distance 14 cm between the
bacterial suspension (broth medium) and Wi-Fi router was
0.13 W/kg. During the exposure, bacterial samples were col-
lected in different times 3, 6, 9, and 12 hours after being
exposed using sterile swabs.
Radiofrequency Simulator
In this study, all exposures were performed using a GSM 900
MHz mobile simulator operating in the “Talk mode.” This
mobile phone simulator was developed at the Department of
Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, School of Med-
icine, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran, by
the collaboration of the private sector.
Outgrowth Curve
For the evaluation of radiofrequency exposure effect on the
growth rate of bacteria, optical density (OD) was measured.

Dose-Response: An International Journal
 For each bacterium, a precisely specified concentration of bac-
terial suspension inoculated in the broth medium and then
divided into 2 series as a control and RF simulator exposure
groups. For estimating the number of bacterial cells in a broth
medium, the turbidity of each group was recorded in 625 nm
absorption at different times using a spectrophotometer
(UNICO UV-2100 Spectrophotometer, UNICO, USA).
Statistical Analysis
All experiments were replicated 3 times for exposed and non-
exposed groups. The means were compared using the nonpara-
metric Mann-Whitney U test, and statistical significance of any
difference observed among the mean values was determined
using SPSS version 15. P < .05 was considered significant.
Results and Discussions
In our study, we have evaluated E coli and L monocytogenes for
their in vitro susceptibility to various antibiotics in the presence
of radiofrequency radiation. For each antibiotic, inhibition
zone was measured and the test was repeated 3 times. Data
obtained for exposed and nonexposed (control) bacteria are
summarized in Table 1.
According to Table 1, for E coli, exposure to Wi-Fi and RF
simulator decreased the inhibition zone diameters that show an
antibacterial resistance pattern. At first, there was no change in
sensitivity, but after increasing the exposure time, a specific
range of antibacterial resistance was observed.
After 24 hours of exposure, as it can be seen in Table 1 and
Figures 1 and 2, the bacteria that were exposed to radiation
showed less resistance compared to early-time exposure. How-
ever, they didn’t return to time 0 exposure condition.
According to Figures 3 and 4, for L monocytogenes,
comparison of data obtained from exposed and nonexposed
groups did not show any significant changes in their anti-
bacterial activity except for DOX. However, for E coli,
there was a significant change in antimicrobial activities
that suggest exposure condition to radiation could influence
the degree of antibiotic susceptibility of E coli more than
Listeria. In a similar pattern, for L monocytogenes, a spe-
cific window of response was observed (Figures 3 and 4).
Listeria monocytogenes response to each antibiotic was dif-
ferent, for DOX, and the window response occurred after 6
hours of exposure to Wi-Fi and RF simulator radiation.
However, for other antibiotics, these changes were only
observed at the ninth hour of exposure to Wi-Fi while this
response could not be observed for RF simulator radiation.
After 9 hours of exposure to Wi-Fi for CIPR and SXT
antibiotics, bacteria had a tendency to become more resis-
tant. This was in contrast to the pattern observed for LEVO,
CTX, and CTR antibiotics, which an increased sensitivity

 was observed. As mentioned above, for Listeria, limited
antibacterial changes were observed for DOX after exposure
to Wi-Fi and RF simulator radiation. On the other hand, we
have previously addressed the bioeffects of the exposure of
bacteria to electromagnetic radiations and investigated dif-
ferent aspects of the challenging issue of the ionizing or
nonionizing radiation-induced alterations in the susceptibil-
ity of microorganisms to antibiotics.19,32-34
In the current study, the pattern of the response of E coli to
Wi-Fi and RF simulator radiation was identical. The maximum
differences in the diameters of inhibition zones were observed
between 6 and 9 hours of the bacterial exposure to radiation
(Figures 1 and 2). After 12 hours of exposure, the bacterial
responses to radiation as a stressor led to returning to the pre-
exposure status. This observation is in line with the previous
reports of Mortazavi et al,18,19,34-36 who showed that the
radiation-induced stimulatory/beneficial effects in bacteria can
be observed only within a narrow window of radiation dose.
Based on this theory, when the radiation level is within the
window (between the lower and upper levels of the window),
stimulatory effects of ionizing or nonionizing radiation can be
detected. Therefore, the response of the bacteria and other
microorganisms to any environmental stressors can be deter-
mined by some key factors such as the magnitude of the dose
and dose rate. This type of response was previously confirmed
in Klebsiella pneumoniae.34
We have also evaluated the effect of radiofrequency radia-
tion on the growth rate of bacteria. As shown in Figures 5 and 6,
during each investigated time period, remarkable differences

 were observed in the rate of bacterial growth in exposed and
nonexposed groups (Table 2). In particular, gram-negative
(E coli) and gram-positive bacteria (L monocytogenes) showed
a significant growth after exposure. Moreover, the time to
reach the logarithmic phase in the growth curve of the bacteria
was faster in exposed groups. However, after 8 hours, based on
OD625 absorbance, the total count of E coli bacteria in the
exposed group was less than that of the control group. These
observations are in line with the finding of Akbal et al.37 How-
ever, the total counts of L monocytogenes after 24 hours of
exposure was higher than that of the control group. At a broader
view, our data confirm previous studies that showed that radio-
frequency radiation could induce changes in cell growth and
antibiotic sensitivity in E coli.
Some researchers have indicated that organisms acquire
resistance through several known factors such as patient non-
compliance or in vitro exposure to radiofrequency radiation.38-40
Nowadays, our world is surrounded by enormous radiofrequency
sources such as Wi-Fi routers and laptop computers that can lead
to serious health problems. When someone is infected with a
microorganism that obtained its resistance from the host envi-
ronment, it causes a serious problem for health-care systems and
treatment failure or receiving a higher dosage of antibiotics will
be possible. Therefore, this may lead to more side effects and
finally prolonged hospitalization.
In several studies,10,41 it was shown that antimicrobial sen-
sitivity alterations were affected by the intensity of electromag-
netic fields. Antibacterial sensitivity also depends on the
physical properties of the electromagnetic fields such as fre-
quency and magnetic flux density, exposure duration, and type
of bacteria. Based on this point, evaluation of the effect of
radiofrequency radiation on bacteria is not only essential to
investigate their environmental effects, but it is also vital for
detecting the antibiotic resistance pattern in the clinical labora-
tories and environment.42-45
Since the frequency of Wi-Fi router is 2.4 GHz while it is
900 MHz for the mobile simulator, we can conclude that the
difference in response to Wi-Fi and the mobile simulator is
possibly due to the frequency of radiation.46 In several studies
on bacteria,34,47,48 one of the factors that influenced anti-
bacterial sensitivity was the cell wall structure of bacteria and
peptidoglycan (PG) nature in gram-positive and gram-negative
bacteria. In gram-positive ones like Listeria, cell wall thickness
is greater than that of gram negatives. The thicker the PG,49 the
permeability of the cell wall to permit the entrance of
molecules to the cells will be decreased. According to these
findings, the frequency of radiation can make some changes in
PG of cell wall and enhance the permeability of the membrane
to antibiotics.8,50 Torgomyan showed that alteration in the
oxidoreduction state of proteins in the bacterial cell membrane
can be the major membranous mechanism after exposure to
low-intensity electromagnetic field.51
Also, the effect of electromagnetic radiation on E coli
cultures was studied by Justo et al,52 which found that cell
growth could be changed (stimulation or inhibition) under
magnetic field. Furthermore, the exposure of E coli ATCC
25992 to the magnetic field of 2 mT at the frequency of 50
Hz caused significant alterations in the morphology, growth
curves, structural parameters, and the sensitivity to certain anti-
biotics such as nalidixic acid, amoxicillin, and erythromy-
cin.9,53 These results were confirmed by the study of Stansell
et al,54 who found that static magnetic fields at moderate inten-
sities are able to decrease the antibiotic sensitivity and make E
coli WHMC 4202 more resistant.
In our study, we used several antibiotics that act through
various mechanisms including protein and DNA synthesis

 inhibition, cell wall inhibition, and dihydrofolate reductase
inhibition (it is summarized in Table 3). Each antibiotic enters
the cell via a specific pathway. Some of them enter via efflux
pumps in the cell membrane,34,55,56 and others enter via ion
channels through the cell wall.57 All of these antibiotics may
enter the cell via a nonspecific mechanism such as endocytosis.
In this mechanism, molecules pass the membrane based on the
permeability of the cell wall.58-60 Considering our results, we
believe that Wi-Fi and mobile exposure can serve as physical
methods to alter the antibacterial susceptibility of microorgan-
isms. In this light, the permeability of the membrane can be
changed by radiofrequency radiation. It seems that the radiation
can alter the sensitivity of the efflux pumps or ion channels by
permitting the entrance of the molecules through the cell wall. In
order to verify these theories, it would be better if this study is
replicated with other pathogenic bacteria both gram-positive and
gram-negative ones with various forms of antibiotics.
Conclusion
Based on our results, it can be concluded that the bacterial
strains used in this study respond differently to EMFs. These
bacteria were capable of responding to environmental stresses
that act by activating some specific systems such as ion chan-
nels, change via the membrane, DNA repair system, and prob-
ably ion efflux pumps in the membrane as well as interactions
of molecules and antibacterial agents.61 There are some ambi-
guities that need further investigations regarding answering
questions such as which cellular mechanism is responsible for
adaptation? Which factors are involved in alterations of anti-
bacterial sensitivity? And subsequently, what are the differ-
ences in the response to radiation in gram-negative and
gram-positive bacteria? Moreover, experiments on different
bacterial strains with various electromagnetic fields should be
performed in the future to better clarify these uncertainties.
