Abstract
Liver injury results in rapid regeneration through hepatocyte proliferation and hypertrophy. 
However, after acute severe injury, such as acetaminophen poisoning, effective regeneration may 
fail. We investigated how senescence may underlie this regenerative failure. In human acute liver 
disease, and murine models, p21-dependent hepatocellular senescence was proportionate to 
disease severity and was associated with impaired regeneration. In an acetaminophen injury mouse 
model, a transcriptional signature associated with the induction of paracrine senescence was 
observed within twenty four hours, and was followed by one of impaired proliferation. In mouse 
genetic models of hepatocyte injury and senescence we observed transmission of senescence to 
local uninjured hepatocytes. Spread of senescence depended upon macrophage-derived TGFβ1 
ligand. In acetaminophen poisoning, inhibition of TGFβ receptor 1 (TGFβR1) improved mouse 
survival. TGFβR1 inhibition reduced senescence and enhanced liver regeneration even when 
delivered after the current therapeutic window for acetaminophen poisoning. This mechanism, in 
which injury-induced senescence impairs liver regeneration, is an attractive therapeutic target for 
developing treatments for acute liver failure.
Introduction
After moderate liver injury or resection, the liver regenerates efficiently through hepatocyte 
proliferation (1, 2). However, following severe acute liver injury there is a failure of 
regeneration and acute liver failure may follow. Acute liver failure can be caused by a 
variety of insults including viruses, toxins and medical therapy, with the most common 
single agent in the Western world being acetaminophen (paracetamol) (3). There are 
approximately 2000 patients affected annually in the US from acute liver failure. Despite its 
relative rarity, acute liver failure is clinically important, due to its high morbidity and 
mortality in previously healthy individuals. Outcomes in acute liver failure have improved 
modestly with advances in supportive care (4). However, once acute liver failure of a defined 
clinical severity is established no specific medical therapies exist, recovery is unlikely and 
unless liver transplantation occurs death usually ensues (5). New therapies are needed for the 
potential treatment window during this progression from acute liver injury to the most severe 
forms of acute liver failure.
Cells may enter growth arrest in response to stress, which is termed senescence when 
permanent. Senescence is associated with changes in morphology and lysosomal activity 
including senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-βGal) expression. Senescence is also 
marked by both a DNA damage response, which includes alterations in chromatin structure 
(e.g. γH2Ax expression), and also the activation of a dynamic pro-inflammatory 
senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) including expression of IL1α and TGFβ 
(6, 7). When senescence results from oncogenic stress it reinforces cell cycle arrest in an 
autocrine manner (8, 9), activates immune surveillance (10–13) and induces paracrine

 senescence via SASP (14, 15). SASP may also modulate fibrosis and regeneration in 
response to acute tissue injury (11, 16, 17). Hepatocyte senescence involves the induction of 
genes encoding p53 (TRP53), p21 (WAF1) and p16 (INK4A) (18). It is described in both 
chronic diseases (19) and steatosis (20), but not in acute liver disease. Fibroblast senescence 
occurs in the dermis following acute wounding (21) and acute myocardial infarction (22). 
However, it is not clear whether there is acute epithelial senescence in response to liver 
injury.
Here, we show that acute liver injury is associated with a suite of senescence markers in 
previously uninjured hepatocytes. We show that senescence is transmitted between 
hepatocytes in a feedback loop that is dependent upon TGFβ derived from macrophages. 
Importantly, targeting TGFβ signaling after acetaminophen-induced injury reduced 
senescence development and improved both regeneration and survival in a mouse model of 
acute liver injury and failure.
Results
Acute liver injury results in proportionate acute hepatocellular senescence
Human liver specimens resected at the time of liver transplantation from patients with 
hyperacute fulminant hepatic failure (less than 1 week from jaundice to encephalopathy, 
with no prior liver disease) showed expression of various senescence related markers 
including p21 (Fig. 1A), DcR2, γH2Ax and SA-βGal (Fig. S1). Thus, in liver disease’s most 
severe form a previously healthy human liver develops widespread markers of hepatocellular 
senescence within days of acute insult. To examine a potential relationship between disease 
severity and senescence induction, we then analyzed a case series of human diagnostic liver 
biopsy samples from patients with sub-massive hepatic necrosis. Here, we observed a direct 
association between hepatic necrosis and hepatocyte senescence as well as an indirect 
association between necrosis and hepatocellular proliferation (Fig. 1B and S1). Therefore, 
worsening acute liver injury in humans results in a proportional expression of senescent 
markers by hepatocytes, associated with a reduced capacity for liver regeneration.
To investigate the functional impact of senescence in acute liver injury, we examined the 
established murine models of acute liver injury induced by carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) (23) 
or acetaminophen (24). Both injury models resulted in expression of senescence markers 
(p21, SA-βGal and p16) by hepatocytes, demonstrating features of growth arrest (absence of 
BrdU or Ki67), the DNA damage response (γH2Ax), senescence associated heterochromatic 
foci (HMGA2) and SASP (IL1α) (Fig. 2A-C and Figs. S2 and S3). We also observed 
senescence marker expression by hepatocytes in dietary models inducing either 
hepatocellular steatosis plus injury (CDE diet) or biliary related liver injury (DDC diet) (Fig. 
S4). In both CCl4 and acetaminophen induced acute liver injury, expression of senescence 
markers was maximal two days after initiation and was lost following hepatocellular 
recovery (Fig. 2D and Figs. S2 and S3 and Table S1). In acetaminophen injury, using 
unbiased transcriptomics, we confirmed a senescence-associated gene expression signature 
24 hours following injury (Fig. 2E and Tables S2 and S3). At 48 hours after acetaminophen 
injury, we observed p21 expression particularly focused to hepatocytes surrounding the area 
of receding necrosis at this time of injury resolution (Fig. 2F and S3C). In acute liver injury-

 induced senescence, the principal target population is the hepatocyte, however, p21 
expression by non-parenchymal cells also occurs (Fig. S2) consistent with the previous 
report by Krizhanovsky et al. (11).
To assess the necessity for p21 in the formation of injury-induced senescence, we performed 
acetaminophen-induced injury in wildtype and p21-deficient (p21KO) mice (Fig. 2G). We 
measured the proliferative response within the perinecrotic area where p21 was expressed by 
wildtype hepatocytes. Injury was equivalent between wildtype and p21KO mice (Fig. S3). 
However, perinecrotic hepatocellular regeneration was increased in p21KO mice compared to 
wildtype mice (Fig. 2H and Table S1). Furthermore, whilst a negative correlation between 
injury and regeneration existed in wildtype mice, a positive correlation was observed in 
p21KO animals (Fig. 2I and Table S1) indicating that in the absence of p21 injury no longer 
impeded the regenerative response. Together, these data show that hepatocytes can enter a 
p21-dependent senescent state following acute injury and that this is associated with 
impaired local regeneration.
TGFβ-dependent senescence transmission between hepatocytes in vivo
Rapid entry of the liver parenchyma into senescence following injury may represent a 
precursor to cell death. However, as we observed increasing expression of senescence 
markers by hepatocytes during the time of necrosis recession, we explored the hypothesis 
that ongoing senescence may be a cellular response to adjacent injury and existing 
senescence. We, and others, have shown that oncogene-induced senescence is not only cell-
autonomous but also spreads via paracrine factors (7, 15). Furthermore, transcriptomic 
analysis revealed a transition between a gene expression signature associated with SASP-
induced senescence and one of cell cycle regulation during the induction of senescence 
following acetaminophen toxicity (Fig. 3A). Thus, we studied the spread of senescence in 
two independent genetic mouse models of senescence.
Murine Double Minute 2 (Mdm2) is a key negative regulator of p53, and the p53/p21 
pathway is central to senescence induction. We induced upregulation of p53 in hepatocytes 
by inducing hepatocyte-specific deletion of Mdm2 (ΔMdm2Hep). We achieved this using the 
AhCre system (25) which expresses Cre recombinase in hepatocytes in response to 
administration of a xenobiotic chemical (β-naphthoflavone - βNF) rendering Mdm2 inactive. 
This resulted in hepatocellular injury as we have previously reported (26). In the ΔMdm2Hep 
mouse model we observed a rapid expression of a suite of senescence markers (Fig. S5). 
Using a mitogen cocktail, consisting of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and triodothyronine 
(T3) (27), we attempted to promote proliferation of senescent hepatocytes in the ΔMdm2Hep 
model, but were unable to do so, unlike in wildtype hepatocytes (Fig. S5). Therefore, these 
cells appeared to be in a state of functional senescence. Next, we tested p21 dependence of 
growth arrest in this model. When Mdm2 was deleted in hepatocytes of p21KO mice, we 
observed rescue of the growth arrest (Fig. S5). Thus, the ΔMdm2Hep model induces acute 
p21-dependent hepatocellular senescence.
To examine spread of senescence, we utilised reduced titration of βNF to delete Mdm2 in a 
subpopulation of hepatocytes (partial ΔMdm2Hep). By doing so, we aimed to distinguish 
cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous senescence induction in hepatocytes (Fig. 3B).

 We define cell-autonomous senescence as being caused through genetic manipulation of that 
cell (e.g. through Mdm2 deletion), whereas we consider non-cell-autonomous senescence as 
an indirect response to environmental senescence and injury in a genetically unmanipulated 
cell. In the ΔMdm2Hep mouse model, a cell-autonomous senescence was observed with 
activation of p21/p16 in association with p53 overexpression within a subgroup of the total 
hepatocyte population (Fig. 3C and Fig. S6). Non-cell-autonomous expression of p21/p16 
occurred in a distinct hepatocyte subpopulation in the absence of p53 overexpression. These 
cells had atypical morphology and more pronounced p21 expression than did their 
neighbouring p21+/p53+ Mdm2-deleted hepatocytes.
Next, we examined a potential geographical relationship between non-cell-autonomous p21 
expression and regional p53+ hepatocytes using a further titrated genetic induction of 
hepatocyte Mdm2 deletion. We observed a lower frequency of non-cell-autonomous p21 
expression and geographical clustering of non-cell-autonomous p21 expressing hepatocytes 
in areas dense with hepatocytes overexpressing p53 (Fig. S6).
We then aimed to study senescence transmission from Mdm2 deleted hepatocytes to local 
hepatocytes in different mouse models. To exclude any extrahepatic effects of AhCre-
mediated recombination (including the intestinal epithelium) (28), we utilised a hepatocyte-
specific induction regime using an adeno-associated viral vector, AAV8-thyroxine binding 
globulin (TBG)-Cre, to induce hepatocyte-specific deletion of Mdm2 (29). As predicted, 
AAV8-TBG-Cre induced deletion of Mdm2 in a subpopulation of hepatocytes (Fig. S6). In 
this model, non-cell-autonomous p21 expression was also observed (Fig. 3D). We did 
observe a very low (0.3% hepatocytes) Cre-independent expression of p21 as a result of 
transfection with the control AAV8 vector (Fig. S6). To test transmission of senescence to 
wildtype hepatocytes, we utilised a large-scale hepatocyte repopulation model. Using 
iterative βNF dosing, we found that the livers of AhCre+ Mdm2fl/fl mice were repopulated 
by hepatocytes derived from transplanted wildtype GFP-tagged cells (26). Following final 
βNF dosing and p53 expression by native hepatocytes, transplanted wildtype hepatocytes 
expressed p21, particularly at the margins of the engrafted nodules (Fig. 3E).
In the ΔMdm2Hep model we observed activation of the TGFβ pathway (Fig. S5). TGFβR1 
was expressed by hepatocytes in addition to non-epithelial cells. The TGFβR1 ligand, 
TGFβ1, was expressed both by non-parenchymal cells and to a lesser degree by hepatocytes. 
As p21 is a canonical TGFβ signaling target gene and the TGFβ signaling pathway has a 
role in oncogene-induced paracrine senescence (14, 15), we hypothesised that the TGFβ1 
ligand plays a mechanistic role in non-cell-autonomous p21 expression by hepatocytes. To 
test the functional role of TGFβR1 and TGFβ1 ligand in transmitted senescence, we utilised 
a model of hepatocyte-specific TGFβ signal pathway activation. Here we used LSL-
TGFβR1-CA mice, which possess a genetically inducible constitutively active (CA) 
TGFβR1 which is expressed upon removal of a stop codon (LSL) by Cre recombinase (30). 
We activated this model by using hepatocyte-targeted recombination (AAV8-TBG-Cre), and 
observed TGFβ pathway activation and acute senescence marker induction in hepatocytes. 
This was accompanied by liver injury and increased paracrine TGFβ1 production (Fig. 3F 
and S7 and S8). Using this as a further model of senescence induction in vivo, we 
investigated non-cell-autonomous senescence driven specifically by the TGFβ pathway as a

 model distinct from Mdm2 deletion. Using lower titrations of AAV8-TBG-Cre, we induced 
TGFβ pathway activation and the R26-LSL-tdTomato reporter in approximately 5% of 
mouse hepatocytes. We observed evidence of non-cell-autonomous spread of senescence to 
adjacent hepatocytes in response to cell-autonomous TGFβ pathway activation (Fig. 3G). 
Thus, we observed non-cell-autonomous senescence in mouse models of acute 
hepatocellular senescence in vivo suggesting that senescence can spread within the liver 
epithelium.
To test the necessity of TGFβ signaling for the transmission of senescence, we returned to 
the ΔMdm2Hep model. Using SB525334, a small molecule inhibitor of TGFβR1, in the 
partial ΔMdm2Hep mouse model we observed reduced hepatocellular pSMAD3 without an 
effect upon hepatocyte ΔMdm2Hep recombination efficiency (Fig. S6). SB525334 treatment 
of partial ΔMdm2Hep resulted in reduced non-cell-autonomous expression of p21 (Fig. 3H 
and Table S4), demonstrating that TGFβ signaling was required for the paracrine induction 
of non-cell-autonomous p21 in this mouse model.
Hepatocyte senescence induced by acute injury is dependent upon macrophage-derived 
TGFβ
Clinically relevant TGFβ inhibitors are currently available (31). Given our findings of 
TGFβ-dependent transmitted senescence in the genetic mouse models, we examined the 
functional role of TGFβR1 signaling in senescence formation in acute liver injury. In human 
fulminant liver failure, senescent hepatocytes showed TGFβ pathway activity (Fig. 4A). 
Acetaminophen-induced liver injury in mice was accompanied by elevated TGFβ1 (Fig. 4B 
and C and Table S5). SMAD7 (a TGFβ pathway target gene) was expressed upon acute liver 
injury and upregulated by perinecrotic hepatocytes (Fig. 4D and Table S5). These 
perinecrotic hepatocytes expressed both TGFβR1 and senescence markers adjacent to local 
TGFβ expression (Fig. 4E and Fig. S10). Therefore, we observed evidence of active TGFβ 
signaling in senescent hepatocytes adjacent to necrosis following acute liver injury.
Macrophages are a known source of TGFβ ligands, particularly in the context of tissue 
injury (32). Perinecrotic macrophages in murine acetaminophen-induced liver injury 
expressed TGFβ1 (Fig. 5A). As both TGFβ and CCL2 (a macrophage chemokine and 
known SASP component) are associated with severe human acute liver disease (33), we 
proceeded to examine the functional role of macrophage recruitment and TGFβ expression 
in senescence induction in our liver injury models. A SASP-related pro-migratory 
chemokine axis developed in partial ΔMdm2Hep mice with expression of both chemokine 
ligands and receptors (Fig. S11). CCL2 was expressed by non-parenchymal cells in and 
around the areas of hepatocellular necrosis in acetaminophen injury (Fig. 5B) prior to an 
increase in circulating monocytes (Fig. 5C) and then local macrophage accumulation (Fig. 
5D and Table S6).
To examine the role of macrophages in non-cell-autonomous senescence, we returned to the 
ΔMdm2Hep mouse model. Inhibition of leukocyte recruitment via CCL2 blockade in the 
ΔMdm2Hep model reduced non-cell-autonomous p21 expression and improved 
hepatocellular regeneration (Fig. 5E and S11 and Table S6). Next, we performed 
macrophage ablation using liposomal clodronate in the partial ΔMdm2Hep model. This

 reduced hepatic TGFβ1 expression by 87% (Fig. 5F and S11 and Table S6), implying that 
macrophages are the principal source of the TGFβ1 ligand. Consistent with this hypothesis, 
both p21 gene expression and non-cell-autonomous p21 expression were reduced when 
macrophages were depleted in the partial ΔMdm2Hep mouse model (Fig. 5F and Table S6). 
To functionally test the role of macrophage-derived TGFβ1 ligand in liver injury, we used 
myeloid specific TGFβ1 deletion in the acetaminophen-induced liver injury mouse model 
(Fig. 5G and S11 and Table S6). This resulted in equivalent injury but improved liver 
regeneration. Therefore, macrophage-derived TGFβ1 is required for optimal induction of 
paracrine senescence following acute liver injury in mice.
Inhibition of TGFβR1 signaling impairs senescence induction and improves liver 
regeneration, function and outcome in acute liver injury
Given the finding of TGFβ-dependent paracrine senescence in the genetic models, we tested 
whether this effect was also observed in two clinically relevant models of liver injury, the 
CCL4 and acetaminophen models. We examined the effect of TGFβ signalling disruption in 
both acute and chronic CCl4 liver injury models. In the acute model, we used the TGFβR1 
inhibitor AZ12601011 administered twelve hours after administration of 1µl/g CCl4. (Fig. 
S12). This resulted in reduced senescence induction, improved liver regeneration and 
reduced jaundice. In the chronic liver injury model, CCl4 was given repeatedly over eight 
weeks in combination with a genetic depletion approach targeting hepatocellular TGFβR1 
(ΔTGFβR1Hep; Fig. S12). Again, we observed reduced hepatocellular p21 expression and 
increased hepatocellular proliferation. Next, we examined ΔTGFβR1Hep in acute 
acetaminophen-induced injury (Fig. S13). We observed early necrosis equivalent to controls, 
but reduced hepatocellular p21 expression by perinecrotic hepatocytes. There was also an 
altered distribution of hepatocellular regeneration, with marked proliferation by perinecrotic 
hepatocytes. Accelerated resolution of necrosis was observed in mice lacking hepatocellular 
TGFβR1.
To test the clinical utility of TGFβR1 inhibition, we administered AZ12601011 at the time 
of a lethal acetaminophen dose (Fig. 6A). TGFβR1 inhibition resulted in marked clinical 
improvement from 6-16 hours and permitted survival following 525mg/kg acetaminophen 
dosing (Fig. 6B and Table S7). At the endpoint, vehicle-treated mice showed worsened 
jaundice compared to their AZ12601011-treated counterparts (Fig. 6C and Table S7).
Conventional treatment of acetaminophen toxicity in humans involves N-acetylcysteine 
therapy which, to be effective, must be given within eight hours after exposure for humans 
or four hours for mice (34). Many patients present to medical services too late for this to be 
effective (35). In order to model delayed treatment, we used small molecule TGFβR1 
inhibitors commencing either SB525334 or AZ12601011 treatment of mice twelve hours 
after acetaminophen administration (Fig. 6D). Additionally, as liver injury peaks prior to 
treatment administration, this strategy was designed to test whether the improvements in 
clinical outcome were distinct from the reduced hepatocellular injury we observed with 
synchronous acetaminophen toxin and therapy administration. With SB525334 treatment, 
downstream signaling through TGFβR1 was inhibited and necrosis was unchanged (Fig. 
S14). Liver injury was reduced upon TGFβR1 inhibition (Fig. S14), along with a resolution

 of jaundice (Fig. 6E and Table S7). Hepatocellular senescence was reduced by TGFβR1 
inhibition (Fig. 6F and Fig. S14 and Table S7) and hepatocellular proliferation increased, 
both overall and specifically within the perinecrotic area (Fig. 6G and Table S7). During 
untreated acetaminophen-induced injury an apparent inverse relationship between severity of 
hepatocellular injury and hepatocellular regeneration was once again observed (Fig. 6H and 
Fig. 2I and Table S7). Therefore, severe liver injury in the mouse recapitulates the negative 
correlation between injury and regeneration observed in severe human disease (Fig. 1). In 
the mouse, this relationship was reversed upon inhibition of TGFβR1, restoring a 
proportional regenerative response to liver injury, mimicking genetic deletion of p21. Using 
a higher dose of acetaminophen to induce non-fatal liver injury, we tested the second clinical 
compound AZ12601011 in the delayed treatment mouse model. Here, jaundice was once 
again improved and was associated with an inhibition of hepatocellular senescence (Fig. 6I 
and Table S7). These effects were accompanied by reduced local TGFβ pathway activation 
in perinecrotic hepatocytes (Fig. S14). Therefore, inhibition of TGFβ signaling following 
acute liver injury reduced hepatocellular senescence and improved liver regeneration and 
recovery from injury.
Discussion
In contrast to minor forms of acute liver injury where regeneration occurs efficiently, 
increasingly severe liver injury exhibits regenerative failure and poorer prognosis (4). 
Validated clinical scoring systems predict the outcomes of patients who will survive versus 
those in whom liver regeneration will ultimately fail (36), suggesting a tipping-point beyond 
which recovery is unlikely. The pathophysiological mechanism underlying this remains 
poorly understood and is a barrier to therapeutic development. Our finding that hepatocyte 
senescence inhibits liver regeneration may underpin this tipping point. These findings 
contrast with previous reports in which senescence following injury in other organs may 
facilitate regeneration (37) and limit fibrosis following liver injury (11).
With our data we provide a mechanistic model whereby injury-induced senescence is 
amplified by macrophage-dependent paracrine TGFβ signalling (Fig. S15). In our in vivo 
models, we observed the expression of local TGFβ ligand in response to cell intrinsic 
TGFβR pathway activation. This may represent a paracrine positive-feedback loop 
reinforcing and amplifying local TGFβ signalling and downstream senescence.
Senescence is challenging to define and study in vivo. Hepatocytes in the ΔMdm2Hep mouse 
model shows functional senescence in vivo. They also express a suite of senescence markers 
(38) including markers of the DNA damage response as well as growth arrest and SASP. 
Likewise, the acetaminophen-induced liver injury model displays senescence marker 
expression by hepatocytes. It also possesses a tissue transcriptomic signature matching that 
of an in vitro oncogene-induced senescence model (the IMR90 ER:RAS model) (15). 
Therefore, we conclude that our two mouse models demonstrate senescence in vivo. A 
similarly rapid senescence program (including TGFβ production, direct Notch target 
activation and p16 expression) has been observed in oncogene-induced senescence models 
within 48 hours in vitro (7, 39). This is similar to our in vivo observations, which were also 
associated with an early inflammatory signature (e.g. TGFβ, IL6 and NF-κB expression)

 within 24 hours post-acetaminophen exposure. In our model, the SASP components TGFβ 
and IL6 are expressed concurrently within 12 hours of acetaminophen exposure, however, 
Hoare et al. have shown that they appear sequentially in senescence in vitro (7). The acute 
injury-induced senescence described here may represent a generic response to severe tissue 
injury whereby regional regeneration is inhibited. Our study does not delineate the 
mechanisms that link hepatocellular injury to senescence initiation. Whether the recently 
described cGAS-STING driven senescence pathway detecting cytoplasmic chromatin (40) 
plays a central role in liver injury-induced senescence remains to be studied. Furthermore, 
the rapid clearance of senescent hepatocytes in our liver senescence models justifies future 
investigation.
We have recently reported in an in vivo model of hepatocyte growth arrest that 
cholangiocytes, which expand as a ductular reaction, may act as facultative stem cells for 
generating hepatocytes with replacement of hepatocytes occurring over weeks to months 
(29). In comparison, resolution of liver injury and architecture in our acetaminophen-
induced and CCl4-induced mouse liver injury models was complete within one week and 
was not accompanied by a ductular reaction. Future studies are required to test whether 
inhibition of senescence in chronic liver injury models (e.g. TGFβ inhibition) may affect 
regeneration from both the hepatocyte and facultative stem cell pools. However, our data in 
mouse genetic models suggest that when senescence formation is impaired, the ductular 
expansion including facultative stem cells is also impaired (Fig. S16).
In the chronic liver injury setting, iterative CCl4-induced fibrosis has been associated with 
non-parenchymal (myofibroblast) senescence and an impaired fibrotic response to injury 
(11). Consistent with this previous report, we observed senescence marker expression by 
non-parenchymal cells both in acute and chronic mouse liver injury models. However, 
following acute injury, the predominant cells expressing senescence markers were 
hepatocytes. Our observations are consistent with a requirement for chronic or iterative 
injury in order to observe persistent populations of non-parenchymal cells with senescence 
marker expression.
In this study we have investigated TGFβ as a tractable target to interrupt paracrine-induced 
non-cell-autonomous p21 expression by hepatocytes in the mouse. Our study does not 
address whether TGFβ inhibition is effective for acute liver injury and failure in man, and 
further human safety and efficacy studies are required. Additionally, study of other SASP 
components which may also promote paracrine senescence following liver injury may be 
worthwhile (15, 41, 42). In acute liver failure, TGFβ is produced in the injured liver (43). 
TGFβ tonically inhibits hepatocellular regeneration during health; however, changes in 
TGFβ ligand and receptor sensitivity facilitate regeneration following partial hepatectomy 
(44, 45). TGFβ is believed to restrict hepatocellular regeneration rather than just acting as a 
brake during the termination phase of liver regeneration (1, 46). Clinical oncology trials of 
TGFβR1 or TGFβ inhibitors in humans are currently underway [e.g. NCT02452008, 
NCT02581787, respectively; see also (31)]. TGFβR2, by acting as a co-receptor of 
TGFβR1, may serve as a further potential target for drug development. Long-term therapy 
using TGFβ inhibition raises potential concerns such as carcinogenesis, autoimmunity or 
cardiac valvulopathies (47). However, these concerns may prove to be less relevant for the

 short periods of therapy (<one week) required for acute liver failure, a condition in which 
the prognosis is otherwise grave. A further relevant concern relates to the potential 
physiological role for TGFβ in mechanically stabilizing the local environment through a 
fibrotic response during acute liver injury. We did not observe hemorrhagic transformation 
(microscopic bleeding into the tissue parenchyma) following TGFβR1 inhibition in our 
treated mice, but further studies to ensure efficacy and safety of TGFβR1 inhibition are 
required.
SASP components including chemokines (e.g. CCL2/CCR2 and CX3CL1/CX3CR1) that 
promote macrophage recruitment and local TGFβ expression within areas of necrosis, are 
well described in human fulminant hepatic failure (33, 48). Macrophage recruitment in liver 
injury shares similarities to the p21-dependent recruitment observed during hepatic 
oncogene-induced senescence (40) and the clearance of early hepatocellular carcinoma (13).
Severe acute hepatic necrosis induces the spread of senescence to remaining viable 
hepatocytes, which impairs hepatocyte-mediated regeneration. This process is 
therapeutically modifiable thus providing the potential for developing future therapies to 
treat this devastating condition.
Materials and Methods
Study design
This study was designed to examine the role of injury-induced senescence in the mammalian 
liver. With patient consent and ethical approval provided by the ethical committees of the 
Scottish A research committee and University Hospitals Leuven, we used archival human 
tissue retrieved as part of routine clinical care. Murine in vivo models were used for 
mechanistic dissection and preclinical compound testing. The n for murine models was 
based on the predicted variance in the model and was powered to detect 0.05 significance of 
30% magnitude; in the event that no predicted variance was inferable from previous work, 
preliminary experiments were performed using n=3 mice. Animals were randomly assigned 
to experimental groups prior to experimental readings; no animals were excluded from 
analysis (two mice in Fig. 6G did not receive BrdU). No blinding was performed during 
experimental administration of treatments to mice; vehicle controls were used and no bias 
was applied during husbandry or during tissue harvesting. Histological sections were 
assigned a randomized blinded code prior to quantification by a separate researcher and the 
randomization was decoded at the time of final data analysis.
Human tissue
Human liver biopsies from a clinical series of cases of sub-massive hepatic necrosis (but not 
necessarily progressing to acute liver failure; n= 74; viral hepatitis n= 13, drug-induced 
hepatitis n= 21 and cryptogenic hepatitis n= 40) were assessed histologically using H&E, 
CK19, p16 and Ki67 staining and evaluated by an expert pathologist (TR), who also 
performed cellular quantification using x400 magnification fields. Diagnoses were based on 
clinical and radiological data and confirmed by histology. Control human tissue was 
obtained from the Brain Bank, University of Edinburgh, comprising cases of sudden

 unexpected death. These cases were reviewed by a pathologist prior to their inclusion as 
normal control tissue.
Animal Models
Animal welfare conditions have been previously described (26). Briefly, male and female 
animals were housed in a specific pathogen free environment and kept under standard 
conditions with a twelve hour day/night cycle and access to food and water ad libitum. Eight 
week old male C57BL/6J mice were purchased from Charles River UK. All animal 
experiments were carried out under procedural guidelines, severity protocols and within the 
UK with ethical permission from the Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Body (AWERB) 
and the Home Office (UK); or in CNIO Spain performed according to protocols 193 
approved by the Institute of Health ‘Carlos III’ Ethics Committee for Research and Animal 
Welfare (CEIyBA) and 194 approved by the Autonomous Community of Madrid. As 
described previously (26), AhCre+/WT mice were crossed with both Mdm2fl/fl and Mdm2fl/+ 
mice to generate AhCre+ Mdm2fl/fl and AhCreWT Mdm2fl/fl and AhCre+ Mdm2fl/+ controls 
and then subsequently crossed with p21KO (49) and TGFβR1fl/fl (50) animals. LysMCre 
mice were crossed with TGFβ1fl/fl animals. Litters from LysMCrehet TGFβ1fl/fl x 
LysMCreWT TGFβ1fl/fl crosses were used for experimental and control animals. Power 
calculations were not routinely performed, however, animal numbers were chosen to reflect 
the expected magnitude of response taking into account the variability observed in previous 
experiments. Genotyping, BrdU administration and i.p. injection of β-Napthoflavone (βNF, 
Sigma UK) at 10-80mg/kg were performed as previously described (26, 51), with BrdU 
given two hours prior to tissue harvest. AAV8 recombination was performed as previously 
described (52). Briefly, viral particles (6.4x108, 2x1011 or 2.5x1011 genetic copies (GC)/
mouse as specified) of AAV8.TBG.PI.Cre.rBG (UPenn Vector Core, Catalogue number: 
AV-8-PV1091) were injected via tail vein in 100µL PBS into male AhCreWT Mdm2fl/fl, 
LSL-TGFβR1-CAHom (30, 53) or wildtype mice. Control male AhCreWT Mdm2fl/fl or LSL-
TGFβR1-CAHom mice received equal AAV8.TBG.PI.Null.bGH (UPenn Vector Core, 
Catalogue number: AV-8-PV0148) injection. Cell transplantation was performed as 
previously described (26), AhCre Mdm2fl/fl recipient mice received 10mg/kg i.p. βNF 4 
days prior to cell transplant of 5x106 GFP expressing cells suspended in 200µL of PBS and 
injected intrasplenically after laparotomy. Transplanted 7-AAD-CD31-CD45-Ter119-
EpCAM+CD24+CD133+ hepatic progenitor cells from wildtype mice fed the CDE diet were 
transfected using 1µg of vector with a puromycin resistant CAG-GFP prior to 
transplantation. The transplantation control group received 200µL PBS only. Recipient mice 
received intraperitoneal injections of 20mg/kg βNF every ten days after transplantation to 
induce persistent liver injury. Mice were sacrificed and the livers were harvested twelve 
weeks after cell transplantation. HGF (250μg/kg, R and D technologies) was administered 
via tail vein injection. Triodothyronine (T3, Sigma) was dissolved in solution (0.01M NaOH, 
0.9M NaCl) at 0.4g/l. This solution was then neutralized with 2M HCl upto just prior to T3 
precipitation and stored at -20°C. T3 was administered at 4mg/kg to mice via subcutaneous 
injection. CDE and DDC-supplemented dietary protocols were as previously described (54). 
200µl of clodronate liposomes or control PBS were injected i.v. as previously described (54). 
TGFβR1 antagonists; SB525334 (Tocris) was given at 10mg/kg twice daily in 10% 
polyethylene glycol, 5% DMSO, 85% saline vehicle by gavage; AZ12601011 (AstraZeneca)

 (47) was given at 50mg/kg twice daily in 0.5% HPMC / 0.1% Tween vehicle by gavage. 
Acetaminophen was prepared as previously described (8) and delivered at 350mg/kg or 
450mg/kg by single i.p. injection of 20µl/g following a ten hour fast. 525mg/kg 
acetaminophen was administered by injection of 30µl/g. CCl4 was delivered by weekly i.p. 
injection for eight weeks at 0.75ml/kg or by single dose at 1ml/kg 1:3 in corn oil. CCL2 
inhibitory antibody (#AF-4679-NA, R and D Systems) was administered (10µg per 
injection) daily for four days by tail vein injection of a 100µg/ml stock diluted in PBS.
Animal tissue harvesting and serum analysis
Mice were killed by CO2 inhalation or cervical dislocation and blood harvested by cardiac 
puncture. Organs were harvested and stored in paraffin blocks following fixation in 10% 
formalin (in PBS) for 18 hours prior to embedding. Blood hematology was performed using 
an IDEXX ProCyte Dx analyzer on blood collected in EDTA. Serum analysis used 
commercial kits according to manufacturer’s instructions for Alanine transaminase (ALT; 
Alpha Laboratories Ltd, UK), microalbumin (Olympus Diagnostics Lt, UK), Aspartate 
Aminotransferase (AST) and Alkaline Phosphatase (Alk Phos; both Randox Laboratories, 
UK).
Immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization
Three μm thick paraffin sections were stained for BrdU, p16, HMGA2, γH2Ax, DcR2 and 
pSMAD3 (AB6326 – clone BU1/75, AB54210 – clone 2D9A12, AB52039, AB81299 – 
clone EP854(2)Y, AB108421 – clone EPR3588(2) and AB52903 – clone EP823Y 
respectively Abcam, UK), p53 (VP-P956-clone CM5, Vectorn), p21 (Clones BMK-2202, 
Santa Cruz and HUGO 291H), Ki67 (M7249 - clone TEC-3 Dako), pSMAD2/3, pSMAD2 
(Cell Signalling #8828 – clone D26F4, #3101), CYP2D6 (Generous gift from Prof R Wolfe, 
University of Dundee) and the ductular cell marker panCK (Z0622 Dako), Species isotype 
(Santa Cruz) staining controls were routinely performed. Detection was performed with 
DAB (DAKO) followed by counterstaining with Haematoxylin or alternatively with Alexa 
488, 555 or 650 (A21206, A21434A21436/S32355 and A21448 respectively; Invitrogen, 
UK) with a DAPI containing Vectashield mounting media (Vector, UK). Histochemical 
detection of senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-βG) was performed as previously 
described (55). In situ mRNA hybridization was performed using RNAscope LS probes for 
TGFβ1, TGFβR1, CCL2, SMAD7 and PPIB control (407758, 406208, 469608, 429418 and 
313918); Advanced Cell Diagnostics) as per the manufacturer’s instructions.
ELISA for murine TGFβ1 ligand was performed using Mouse/Rat/Porcine/Canine TGF-beta 
1 Quantikine ELISA Kit (R and D system) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Whole 
liver tissue samples were homogenized in RIPA-Buffer (50mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 1% 
Triton x-100, 0.5% Deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) supplemented with NaF, protease- and 
phosphatase-inhibitors and cleared by centrifugation. Protein concentration was determined 
by BCA Assay (Thermo Scientific #23225). The samples were diluted 1:4. To allow TGFβ 
activation 20ul of 1M HCL and 20ul of 1.2M NaOH/0,5M HEPES were added to each 100ul 
sample. Optical density was measured using Safire II microplate reader (TECAN) at 450 nm 
(reference wavelength 540nm).

 Microscopy and cell counting
Images were obtained on a Zeiss Axiovert 200 microscope using a Zeiss Axiocam MRc 
camera. Cell counts were performed manually on blinded slides and consecutive non-
overlapping fields at x200 magnification. Perinecrotic hepatocytes were defined as those 
contacting the area of necrosis. Confocal image analysis was performed using a Leica SP5 
system with the pinhole set to 1 airy unit. DAPI, Alexafluor 488 and 555 were detected 
using band paths of 415-480, 495-540 and 561-682nm for 405, 488 543nm lasers 
respectively. Serial sections were aligned manually in Adobe Photoshop CS5; images were 
colour deconvoluted using imageJ using haematoxylin/DAB settings (version 1.5). For 
RNAscope and quantification of necrosis slides were scanned on an SCN400F slide scanner 
(Leica, Milton Keynes, UK) and the files analysed using Halo v2.0 Image Analysis Software 
(Indica Labs, Corrales, NM, USA) as previously described. For perinecrotic SMAD7 
quantification, perinecrotic and uninjured pericentral areas were manually defined by 
drawing a ring (200μm radius from vein or necrosis) around ten centrilobular structures per 
sample. Results are expressed as probe copies/area for RNAscope. Necrosis was defined 
after validation of classifier definition of healthy liver, haemorrhagic necrosis and non-
haemorrhagic necrosis with results expressed as % area necrosis. All scale bars = 50μm.
Real time PCR and gene expression analysis
Total RNA was extracted from 30-50mg tissue samples previously stored in RNAlater at 
-80°C, using a combination of TRIzol™ reagent (Invitrogen) and Qiagen RNeasy Mini 
system (Qiagen, UK) according to both manufacturers’ instructions. gDNA 
decontamination, reverse transcription and real time PCR were performed using reagents 
and primers (Quantifast and Quantitect respectively, Qiagen, UK) on an ABI Prism 7500 
cycler, except for chemokine/chemokine receptor analysis which was performed as 
previously described (56). Data were collected using the LightCycler system following 
normalization to the housekeeping gene peptidylprolyl isomerase A (Ppia); or Gapdh for 
chemokine/chemokine receptor data. All samples were run in triplicates.
RNAseq analysis
Total RNA was extracted from 30-50mg tissue samples as described above. Purified RNA 
was tested on an Agilent 2200 Tapestation using RNA screentape. Libraries for cluster 
generation and DNA sequencing were prepared following an adapted method from Fisher et 
al.(57) using Illumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA LT Kit, Quality and quantity of the DNA 
libraries was assessed on a Agilent 2200 Tapestation (D1000 screentape) and Qubit (Thermo 
Fisher Scientific) respectively. The libraries were run on the Illumina Next Seq 500 using the 
High Output 75 cycles kit (2x36cycles, paired end reads, single index). Quality checks on 
the raw RNASeq data files were done using fastqc version 0.10.1 and fastq_screen version 
0.4.2. RNASeq reads were aligned to the GRCm38 (58) version of the mouse genome using 
tophat2 version 2.1.0 (59) with Bowtie version 2.2.6.0 (60). Expression values were 
determined and statistically analysed by a combination of HTSeq version 0.5.4p3, the R 
3.4.2 environment, utilizing packages from the Bioconductor data analysis suite and 
differential gene expression analysis based on the negative binomial distribution using 
DESeq2 (61). Gene set enrichment analysis was performed using the Broad Institute Online

 Platform. An OIS signature was defined by the top 100 upregulated gene in the IMR90 
ER:RAS model (15).
Statistical analysis
Prism software (GraphPad Software, Inc) was used for all statistical analyses; t tests were 
used for normally distributed samples (D’Agostino Pearson omnibus test was used to assess 
Gaussian distribution) with Welch’s correction if variances differed (F test). One or two way 
ANOVA was used to compare multiple (>2) samples or groups, respectively. Mean hepatic 
progenitor cells per x200 magnification field from 30 fields for each mouse were compared. 
Data are presented as mean +/- SEM throughout; n refers to biological replicates in all 
instances unless otherwise stated.

 Accessible Summary: Freeing the chains holding back liver regeneration
The liver is a paradigm of organ regeneration, however regeneration may fail in a 
previously normal liver following acute severe injury such as acetaminophen poisoning. 
We show that a process which prevents proliferation termed senescence, which is 
classically associated with aging and carcinogenesis, stops the liver’s regenerative cells 
after acute injury. This senescence can be spread from cell to cell by the signaling 
molecule TGFβ. When TGFβ signaling is inhibited during acetaminophen poisoning in 
mice senescence is impeded, regeneration accelerates, and survival is improved. 
Therefore targeting senescence induced by acute tissue injury is an attractive therapeutic 
approach to improve regeneration.
