Abstract
The body of science evaluating the potential impacts of unconventional natural gas devel-
opment (UNGD) has grown significantly in recent years, although many data gaps remain.
Still, a broad empirical understanding of the impacts is beginning to emerge amidst a swell
of research. The present categorical assessment provides an overview of the peer-
reviewed scientific literature from 2009–2015 as it relates to the potential impacts of UNGD
on public health, water quality, and air quality. We have categorized all available original
research during this time period in an attempt to understand the weight and direction of the
scientific literature. Our results indicate that at least 685 papers have been published in
peer-reviewed scientific journals that are relevant to assessing the impacts of UNGD. 84%
of public health studies contain findings that indicate public health hazards, elevated risks,
or adverse health outcomes; 69% of water quality studies contain findings that indicate
potential, positive association, or actual incidence of water contamination; and 87% of air
quality studies contain findings that indicate elevated air pollutant emissions and/or atmo-
spheric concentrations. This paper demonstrates that the weight of the findings in the scien-
tific literature indicates hazards and elevated risks to human health as well as possible
adverse health outcomes associated with UNGD. There are limitations to this type of
assessment and it is only intended to provide a snapshot of the scientific knowledge based
on the available literature. However, this work can be used to identify themes that lie in or
across studies, to prioritize future research, and to provide an empirical foundation for policy
decisions.

 Introduction
Shale and tight gas development (known to nontechnical stakeholders as “fracking” and
referred to herein as unconventional natural gas development, UNGD) continues to be the
focus of controversy. Amidst economic and geopolitical considerations, the potential environ-
mental and public health impacts of UNGD have received substantial attention in policy,
media, and public debates. Claims of ground water contamination and adverse health out-
comes have been widely cited and disputed, but what does the science actually show?
While research continues to lag behind the rapid scaling of UNGD, there has been a surge
of peer-reviewed scientific papers published in the past several years (Fig 1). By the end of
2015, over 80% of the peer reviewed scientific literature on shale and tight gas development has
been published since January 1, 2013 and over 60% since January 1, 2014. This suggests an
emerging understanding of the environmental and public health implications of UNGD in the
scientific community. Yet, although numerous hazards and risks have been identified in studies
to date, many data gaps remain. Notably, while there is now a far more substantive body of sci-
ence than there was several years ago, there is still only a limited amount of epidemiology that
explores associations between risk factors and health outcomes in human populations [1].
In this assessment we provide an overview, a current snapshot, of the scientific knowledge
on potential environmental public health hazards, elevated risks, and outcomes associated with
the development of shale and tight gas. We include only published, peer-reviewed literature
available on the subject. More nuanced and systematic peer-reviewed public health review arti-
cles that provide greater levels of appraisal and analysis with in-depth narrative are available
[2–4]. This particular assessment is intended to provide a broad understanding of the scientific
literature in order to support the following goals:
Fig 1. Number of publications that assess the impacts of UNGD per year, 2009–2015. At least 685 papers have been published in peer-reviewed
scientific journals that are relevant to assessing the impacts of UNGD. The number of papers published per year has continually risen and at least 226 were
published in 2015 alone.

our adherence to PLOS ONE policies on sharing data
and materials.
 • To understand the weight and direction of the scientific literature
• To provide comprehensive lists of studies in a field
• To identify themes that lie in or across individual studies
• To map and categorize existing literature for further review
• To prioritize future research and investigations
As activities continue to expand, counties, states, and nations are in a unique position to
learn from experiences and scientific assessments conducted where UNGD is already under-
way [5,6]. While responsible energy policies require more than empirical data inputs [7,8], leg-
islative and regulatory activities will benefit from the emerging body of science on the
environmental and public health implications of UNGD. This assessment can be viewed as a
summary of the peer-reviewed literature in order to help facilitate research efforts and inform
policy discussions at the federal, state, and local levels.
Methods
Database assemblage and review
This assessment was conducted using the PSE Database on Shale and Tight Gas Development
(available at: http://psehealthyenergy.org/site/view/1180 and referred to herein as the PSE
Database). This near exhaustive collection of peer-reviewed scientific literature on the impacts
of UNGD is divided into 12 topics: air quality, climate, community, ecology, economics, gen-
eral, health, regulation, seismicity, waste/fluids, water quality, and water usage. We assembled
this database over three years using a number of search strategies, including the following:
• Systematic searches in scientific databases across multiple disciplines:
� PubMed (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/)
� Web of Science (http://www.webofknowledge.com)
� ScienceDirect (http://www.sciencedirect.com)
• Searches in existing collections of scientific literature on unconventional natural gas develop-
ment, such as the Marcellus Shale Initiative Publications Database at Bucknell University
(http://www.bucknell.edu/script/environmentalcenter/marcellus), complemented by Google
(http://www.google.com) and Google Scholar (http://scholar.google.com)
• Manual searches (hand-searches) of references included in peer-reviewed studies and gov-
ernment reports that directly pertain to unconventional natural gas development.
For scientific literature search engines we used a combination of Medical Subject Headings
(MeSH)-based and keyword strategies, which included the following terms as well as relevant
combinations thereof:
shale gas, shale, hydraulic fracturing, fracking, drilling, natural gas, air pollution, methane,
water pollution, health, public health, water contamination, fugitive emissions, air quality,
climate, seismicity, waste, fluids, economics, ecology, water usage, regulation, community,
epidemiology, Marcellus, Barnett, Fayetteville, Haynesville, Denver-Julesberg Basin, uncon-
ventional gas development, and environmental pathways.

 Our database and this assessment excluded technical papers on UNGD not applicable to
determining its potential impacts. Examples of literature that we excluded are engineering
papers on optimal drilling strategies, petroleum reservoir evaluations, estimation algorithms of
absorption capacity, patent efficacy assessments, and fracture models designed to inform stim-
ulation techniques. Because our assessment is limited to papers subjected to external peer-
review, it did not include government reports, environmental impact statements, policy briefs,
white papers, law review articles, or other grey literature. Our assessment also excluded studies
on some forms of UNGD, such as coalbed methane/coal seam gas as well as other forms of fos-
sil fuel extraction that specifically exclude shale and/or tight gas development (e.g., tarsands, oil
shale, etc.). While we are sure that we include the vast majority and certainly the most seminal
studies on the environmental public health dimensions of UNGD in leading scientific journals,
it is possible that a small number of publications are missing. As such, we refer to the literature
database as near exhaustive.
The PSE Database has been used and reviewed by academics, experts, and government offi-
cials throughout the United States and internationally and has been subjected to public and
professional scrutiny before and after this assessment. It represents the most comprehensive
public collection of peer-reviewed scientific literature on shale and tight gas development avail-
able. Again, many of the publications in this database are discussed in greater detail in pub-
lished review articles [2–4] and government reports [9,10].
Scope of assessment
Definitions.
There has been significant confusion about the environmental dimensions of
UNGD (often termed “fracking”) because of the lack of uniform, well-defined terminology and
boundaries of analysis [11]. The public and the media often use the term “fracking” as an
umbrella term to refer to the entirety of UNGD (and often other forms of oil and gas develop-
ment), including processes such as land clearing, well stimulation, hydrocarbon production,
storage and transportation, and waste disposal. On the other hand, the oil and gas industry and
many in the scientific community generally use the term as shorthand for one particular type
of well stimulation method used to enhance the production of oil and natural gas: hydraulic
fracturing.
The PSE Database and this assessment are focused on UNGD in its entirety, and not only
the method of well stimulation. Environmental and public health assessments that include only
the latter should have a limited role in policy discussions. In order to understand the environ-
mental and public health dimensions of UNGD any reasonable approach must engage beyond
a narrow view of only the well stimulation process of hydraulic fracturing, especially when the
scientific literature indicates that other UNGD processes warrant greater concern. As such, the
boundaries of our assessment include scientific literature on hydraulic fracturing and the asso-
ciated operations and ancillary infrastructure required to develop and distribute unconven-
tional natural gas. Although we use the term UNGD to refer to shale and tight gas
development, some of the studies included in this report may either include data from, or be
applicable to, other forms of UNGD enabled by hydraulic fracturing. Again, those focused
solely on coal seam gas are beyond the scope of this assessment.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria.
The temporal focus of this assessment was between 1 Jan-
uary 2009 and 31 December 2015 in order to capture what we believe to be the entirety of the
published peer reviewed science on environmental public health dimensions of UNGD for this
time period. We did not include papers released in 2015 ahead of print that will be published in
2016. We included original studies that evaluate environmental and public health hazards, risks,
and impacts of UNGD, narrowly defined as shale or tight gas development (Table 1).

 The majority of publications in the PSE Database are not considered in this assessment and
we excluded the following topics: climate, community, ecology, economics, regulation, seismic-
ity, waste/fluids, and water usage. Although many of these topics also have public health impli-
cations (e.g., climate change, economics, water usage, etc.), we have focused this assessment on
original research that directly pertains to 1) public health, 2) water quality, and 3) air quality.
We excluded some studies that may be located in the three topics used in this assessment, such
as those that only provide baseline data or address research methods but fail to assess hazards,
risks, or associated impacts.
As previously mentioned, we restricted the studies included in this assessment to those pub-
lished from 1 January 2009 through 31 December 2015. There are studies on conventional forms of
oil and natural gas development that are relevant to the public health dimensions of UNGD, but to
maintain greater consistency we excluded those prior to 2009 from the assessment. For example,
we did not include a study published in The Lancet that examined the association between testicular
cancer and employment in agriculture and oil and gas development published in 1984 [12].
Relatedly, the scope of some of the studies we included in this assessment may go beyond
shale and tight gas and could potentially include other forms of both conventional and uncon-
ventional oil and gas development. For instance, some of the top-down, field-based air pollu-
tion studies that gauge leakage rates and emission factors in Western oil and gas fields [13,14].
We included studies not exclusively related to UNGD only when the focus of the studies is rele-
vant and they were published within our specified timeframe. For instance, studies that mea-
sured VOC emissions in a region with shale gas development as well as other forms of
conventional and unconventional oil and gas development were included in this assessment.
Lastly, we only included original research in our assessment. We considered research origi-
nal if it measured potential or actual health outcomes or complaints and air quality and water
quality assessments related to UNGD. We excluded literature that attempted to determine pub-
lic opinion or that considered methods for future research agendas.
Categorical framework
We have created binary categories for each topic in an attempt to identify and group studies in
an intuitive way that focuses on the indication of what might be considered to be a relevant or
significant impact. Some of the studies categorized belong in more than one topic. For instance,
studies that contain data that are relevant to both air quality and public health are included in
both of these topics [15–17].
As with any scientific analysis there is also a qualitative component in our operational defi-
nitions and methods of categorization (Table 2). It is possible that some may disagree as to
Table 1. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria.

 what constitute findings that indicate a public health hazard or elevated risk. To address this
concern we have listed specific criteria of what would qualify a study for inclusion in a particu-
lar category within each relevant section below. Examples include statistically significant posi-
tive associations between UNGD or a particular health outcome or measurements documented
above recommended air quality standards. In some cases, the relative significance of an impact
related to UNGD is based on the interpretation of the evidence by the authors of the study.
Readers may also refer to the tables included in the appendix for citations and categorization of
the studies, which are listed alphabetically by author in each topic (S1 Appendix).
Our approach often does not account for various nuances in the results of particular studies.
For instance, some studies may contain findings of both positive associations and no associa-
tions between UNGD and particular health outcomes. In our assessment we chose to include a
study with any positive finding or indication of a particular impact in Category A. As such, a
study that found an association between UNGD and health endpoint X, but no association
with health endpoints Y and Z, would still be included in Category A.
Public Health.
Studies that assess public health risks and endpoints, including epidemio-
logic investigations, continue to be particularly limited compared to studies of public health haz-
ards. To date, most of the peer-reviewed health oriented publications are commentaries and
literature reviews. In this topic we included original research that considers the question of public
health in the context of UNGD. Of course, empirical findings in other categories such as air qual-
ity and water quality are relevant to public health. However, in this topic we only include those
studies that directly consider the health of human populations and individuals as well as studies
that examine animal health as they can provide sentinel information for human health risks.
In this topic we consider research “original” if it measures potential or actual health out-
comes or complaints (i.e., not health research that only attempts to determine public opinion
or consider methods for future research agendas). In addition to epidemiology, we included
studies in this topic that focus primarily on environmental monitoring, but which also contain
significant discussion about public health risks or outcomes [15,18,19]. In some of these cases,
we have cross-listed the study within the water or air quality topic.
For the public health topic, we placed a study in category A or B based on whether or not it
provided evidence, documentation, or acknowledgment of any of the following that are attrib-
uted to UNGD:
• A positive association with at least one adverse health outcome (e.g., birth defects,
hospitalization)
• A positive association with a known human health risk (e.g., elevated benzene
concentrations)

 • Increased health risks from exposure to pollutant emissions
• A positive association with reported health symptoms in randomized survey proximity
analysis
• Self-reported health symptoms or complaints in humans or animals;
• Toxicological concerns in the context of protective limitations (e.g, monitoring
impediments)
• Explicit health concerns based on documented environmental contamination (e.g., endocrine
disruption chemicals, high PAH levels in ambient air, etc.)
Water Quality.
The allocation of water quality studies to binary categories is more com-
plex than those focused on human health in that some rely on empirical field measurements,
while others explore mechanisms for contamination or use modeled data to assess or predict
water quality risks. Some of these studies explored only one aspect of UNGD, such as waste dis-
posal or the well stimulation process enabled by hydraulic fracturing. These studies did not
always indicate whether or not UNGD as a whole is associated with water contamination and
are therefore limited in their utility for gauging water quality impacts. Nonetheless, we
included all original research, including modeling studies as well as those that consider con-
tamination mechanisms and/or exposure pathways. We excluded studies that explored only
evaluative methodology or baseline assessments prior to UNGD as well as papers that only
comment on or review previous studies. Here we were only concerned with actual findings in
the field or modeling studies that specifically address the risk or potential occurrence of water
contamination.
For this topic, we placed a study in category A or B based on whether or not it provided evi-
dence, documentation, or acknowledgment of any of the following that are attributed to
UNGD:
• A positive association with water contamination (e.g., proximity analysis showing increased
concentrations of methane, heavy metals, salinity, etc.)
• Elevated surface or groundwater pollutant concentrations resulting from fluid releases or
wastewater treatment/disposal
• Plausible contamination pathways and potential for water quality impacts from risk assess-
ment/analysis of failure mechanism (e.g., casing and cement impairment)
• Plausible contamination pathways and potential for water quality impacts from modeling or
geochemical evidence
• Water quality impacts based on analysis of microbial communities
• A significant quantity of reported incidents of water contamination relative to development
activity
Air Quality.
The papers included in the air quality assessment are those that specifically
address air pollutant emissions and atmospheric concentrations from UNGD at either a local
or regional scales. These papers primarily include measurements of local and regional emis-
sions and atmospheric concentrations of non-methane volatile organic compounds, hazardous
air pollutants, and tropospheric ozone attributable to upstream natural gas, and sometimes oil,
activities since atmospheric measurements usually account for both.

 Although methane is a precursor to global background tropospheric ozone concentrations
we excluded studies that focus exclusively on methane emissions from this topic. We do, how-
ever, include studies that measure emissions of methane and non-methane volatile organic
compounds (VOC), given the known health-damaging dimensions of a number of VOCs (i.e.,
benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene, 1,3 butadiene, acetaldehyde, etc.) and the role of light
alkane VOCs in the production of the respiratory irritant, tropospheric (ground-level) ozone.
We included a few studies that explore the public health risks associated with air pollutant
emissions in both the air and the public health categories.
For this topic, we placed a study in category A or B based on whether or not it provided evi-
dence, documentation, or acknowledgment of any of the following that are attributed to UNGD:
• Measurement(s) or estimation(s) of emissions or atmospheric concentration in excess of rec-
ommended air quality standards (e.g., NAAQS, federal ozone standards, etc.)
• Emission estimates that are significantly elevated above state emission inventory estimates
• Public health risks due to toxic air emissions or ambient air concentrations
• Measurement of emissions and/or atmospheric concentrations highly elevated over regional
background
Results
Public Health
Based on our criteria, we included 31 original research studies relevant to UNGD and public
health hazards, risks, and health outcomes. Of these 31 studies, 26 (84%) contain findings that
indicate public health hazards, elevated risks, or adverse public health outcomes and 5 (16%)
contain findings that indicate no significant public health hazards, elevated risks, or adverse
health outcomes associated with UNGD (Fig 2). The vast majority of all papers on this topic indi-
cate the need for additional study, particularly large-scale, quantitative epidemiologic research.
Water Quality
Based on our criteria, we included 58 original research studies relevant to shale gas development and
water quality. Of these 58 studies, 40 (69%) have findings that indicate potential, positive association,
or actual incidence of water contamination associated with UNGD, while 18 (31%) have findings
that indicate minimal potential, no association, or rare incidence of water contamination (Fig 2).
Air Quality
Based on our criteria, we included 46 original research studies relevant to questions involving
associations between UNGD and air pollutant emissions and atmospheric air pollutant con-
centrations. Of these 46 studies, 40 (87%) have findings that indicate that UNGD increased air
pollutant emissions and/or atmospheric concentrations, while 6 (12%) of the studies contain
findings that provide no indication of significantly elevated air pollutant emissions and/or
atmospheric concentrations (Fig 2).
Discussion
In this assessment, we reviewed the findings of original peer-reviewed research that evaluates
associations between UNGD and air quality, water quality, and public health to determine the
direction of the scientific literature. For each topic we found that the majority of original

 research indicate hazards, elevated risks, or potential impacts from UNGD on the outcome of
interest. These results suggest that UNGD may contribute to an environmental public health
burden, which is consistent with numerous scientific review articles and government reports.
Fig 2. Selection Process and Results. This assessment draws from the peer-reviewed literature for three topics in the PSE Database: Air Quality, Health,
and Water Quality. Of the 61 publications in air quality, 46 met our criteria; of the 78 publications in health, 31 met our criteria; and of the 114 publications in
water quality, 58 met our criteria. From here we placed the original research that met our criteria into one of two categories (see Table 2). Our results indicate
that 84% of public health studies contain findings that that indicate public health hazards, elevated risks, or adverse health outcomes, 69% of water quality
studies contain findings that indicate potential, positive association, or actual incidence of water contamination, and 87% of air quality studies contain findings
that indicate elevated air pollutant emissions and/or atmospheric concentrations.

 A review of the research included in this assessment can help identify themes that emerge in
study design, methodology, hypotheses, scope, findings, and recommendations. With regard to
the latter, one one theme that continually emerged was a recommendation for additional
empirical investigations to better understand the risks to water, air, and public health presented
by UNGD. Other themes included the recognized need among researchers for baseline studies
to allow for before and after comparative assessments and longitudinal data to determine
potential short- and long-term impacts.
Numerous data gaps on the environmental and public health impacts of UNGD exist, many
of which have already been recognized in the scientific literature. Several notable data gaps are
worth mentioning, however, and the following remain largely unknown: the extent to which
the presence of stray-gas in aquifers indicates the potential for chemical contamination from
hydraulic fracturing fluids; changes in well integrity failure rates over time; the legacy effects
and relative contribution of air pollutants emissions from aging and abandoned wells; exposure
data to characterize the frequency, duration, and degree of exposure to various stressors; com-
munity health risks from physical hazards (e.g., light and noise); and the overall magnitude of
human-health risks.
The need for quantitative epidemiological research on this subject is widely recognized in
the scientific community, but it is difficult to conduct until exposure parameters are better
determined and reported cases of health outcomes are analyzed. Many epidemiological studies
are expensive, time consuming, and often rely on data that are difficult to obtain. The fact that
potential exposures would have taken place before background data could be collected only
complicates the issue. Although there is quite a bit of evidence of hazards and elevated risks,
drawing conclusions about the magnitude of health burdens attributable to UNGD remains
difficult from an epidemiological perspective.
Limitations
There are limitations to this assessment that relate to both its methods and the interpretation
of its findings. As previously mentioned, the type of binary categorization we used may not
account for the nuances of findings in many of these studies. Relatedly, this type of categoriza-
tion effectively ranks the quality of the studies included in this article equally, despite clear dif-
ferences in the weight and merit that should be ascribed to each study, based on either its
design or interpretation of the evidence. Our work, however, was not intended to provide com-
mentary on the quality of each study since here we are primarily concerned with the overall
weight of the evidence. The quality and subsequent weight that should be given to a particular
study are influenced by a number of factors, such as its design, methodology, and execution.
We have only broadly surveyed original research across three different topics, including, but
not limited to, qualitative epidemiology, risk analysis, in situ measurements, and modeling
studies. There are strengths and weaknesses with each empirical method and it was not our
aim to consider these attributes on an individual basis. Ultimately, this assessment relied on
the peer-reviewed process itself in its consideration of the quality of the work. While not all
peer-reviewed studies are of equal merit, this appeared to be the most simple, useful, and
appropriate standard for quality control and consideration given our purposes.
Our selection criteria influence the categorization process and certain data inputs are gained
or lost by our decisions to include or exclude particular type of studies. By only including origi-
nal research on air quality, water quality, and public health, we are not accounting for all of the
studies that may be pertinent to each topic (e.g., the existence or absence of elevated public
health hazards, etc.). For instance, climate change, water usage, and economic gains may all
influence environmental and public health outcomes. We have excluded these topics from our

 analysis and have chosen to focus only on the three that have consistently received the most atten-
tion among environmental public health researchers. Additionally, by not including government
reports that do not appear in peer-reviewed journals we may be missing useful data and analysis
that can inform UNGD public health implications as well as air and water quality concerns.
The majority of studies included in this assessment were conducted to determine whether
or not adverse effects from UNGD exist. These types of investigations may, by their very
nature, produce reporting or design bias. This is an inherent limitation of the scientific disci-
pline; scientists are not immune from value judgments that shape research and scientific rea-
soning, including hypotheses to be tested, boundaries of analysis, and interpretation of
evidence. Biases are difficult to account for in this context and we have chosen to rely on the
peer-review process in this determination.
Furthermore, while the PSE Database is–to our best knowledge–exhaustive, our literature
search may not have captured every relevant peer-reviewed scientific paper. Some journal arti-
cles are not always available in electronic databases or may be captured at a later time. As
UNGD continues to gain the attention of the scientific community in other parts of the world,
more and more research on the subject has been published in relatively obscure journals that
may not be readily available. While we are confident that our MeSH-terms account for nearly
all of the research on this topic, there is a possibility that some studies that use different or less
traditional terminology may have been missed. We did our best to account for what may not
have been initially discovered in an online database with manual searches of the scientific liter-
ature over a several year period.
Differences in geography, geology, petroleum reservoir type, and regulatory regime may
also render some studies less relevant when interpreted across geographic space. Our assess-
ment is only concerned with current empirical evidence in the peer-reviewed literature and we
do not consider different regulatory regimes that could potentially influence environmental
and public health outcomes in positive or negative ways. For instance, technological improve-
ments such as universal deployment of reduced emission completions may mitigate some exist-
ing air pollutant emission issues.
Despite its limitations, our assessment provides a general understanding of the weight of the
scientific evidence of possible impacts arising from UNGD that are relevant to environmental
public health. It demonstrates that the weight of the scientific literature indicates that there are
hazards and elevated risks to human health as well as possible adverse health outcomes.
Finally, it must be understood that all forms of energy production and industrial processing
have environmental impacts. Our assessment is only focused on assessing the available science
on the environmental and public health dimensions of the development of natural gas from
shale and tight formations. We make no claims about the level of impact that should be toler-
ated by society–these are ultimately value judgments that incorporate more than empirical
findings.
