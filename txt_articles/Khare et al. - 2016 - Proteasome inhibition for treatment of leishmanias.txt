Abstract
Chagas disease, leishmaniasis, and sleeping sickness affect 20 million people worldwide and lead 
to more than 50,000 deaths annually1. The diseases are caused by infection with the kinetoplastid 
parasites Trypanosoma cruzi, Leishmania spp. and Trypanosoma brucei spp., respectively. These

 parasites have similar biology and genomic sequence, suggesting that all three diseases could be 
cured with drug(s) modulating the activity of a conserved parasite target2. However, no such 
molecular targets or broad spectrum drugs have been identified to date. Here we describe a 
selective inhibitor of the kinetoplastid proteasome (GNF6702) with unprecedented in vivo 
efficacy, which cleared parasites from mice in all three models of infection. GNF6702 inhibits the 
kinetoplastid proteasome through a non-competitive mechanism, does not inhibit the mammalian 
proteasome or growth of mammalian cells, and is well-tolerated in mice. Our data provide genetic 
and chemical validation of the parasite proteasome as a promising therapeutic target for treatment 
of kinetoplastid infections, and underscore the possibility of developing a single class of drugs for 
these neglected diseases.
Kinetoplastid infections affect predominantly poor communities in Latin America, Asia and 
Africa. Available therapies suffer from multiple shortcomings, and new drug discovery for 
these diseases is limited by insufficient investment3. We sought low molecular weight 
compounds with a growth inhibitory effect on Leishmania donovani (L. donovani)4,5, 
Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi)6,7 and Trypanosoma brucei (T. brucei)5,8. Our approach was to 
test 3 million compounds in proliferation assays on all three parasites (Supplementary 
Information Tables 1–3), followed by triaging of active compounds (half-maximum 
inhibitory concentration value EC50<10 μM) to select those with a clear window of 
selectivity (>5-fold) with respect to growth inhibition of mammalian cells. An 
azabenzoxazole, GNF5343, was identified as a hit in the L. donovani and T. brucei screens. 
Although GNF5343 was not identified in the T. cruzi screen, we noted potent anti-T. cruzi 
activity of this compound in secondary assays.
Optimization of GNF5343 involved the design and synthesis of ~3,000 compounds, and 
focused on improving bioavailability and potency on inhibition of L. donovani growth 
within macrophages (Fig. 1). A critical modification involved replacement of the 
azabenzoxazole center with C6-substituted imidazo- and triazolopyrimidine cores, which 
yielded compounds up to 20-fold more potent on intra-macrophage L. donovani (e.g. 
GNF2636). Replacement of the furan group with a dimethyloxazole ring reduced the risk of 
toxicity associated with the furan moiety, and replacement of the chlorophenyl group with a 
fluorophenyl improved selectivity over mammalian cell growth inhibition (e.g. GNF3849). 
These changes also resulted in low clearance and acceptable bioavailability. Further 
substitutions at the core C6 position led to GNF6702 and a 400-fold increase in intra-
macrophage L. donovani potency compared to GNF5343.
L. donovani parasites cause a majority of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) cases in East Africa 
and India9. In mice infected with L. donovani10, oral dosing with GNF6702 effected a more 
pronounced reduction in liver parasite burden than miltefosine, the only oral anti-leishmanial 
drug available in clinical practice5 (Fig. 2a). The miltefosine regimen for VL efficacy studies 
was chosen to approximate the drug plasma concentration of the clinical regimen11. We 
noted a greater than three log reduction in parasite load after eight day treatment with 10 
mg/kg of GNF6702 twice-daily with the free concentration of GNF6702 (fraction unbound 
in plasma=0.063) staying above the L. donovani EC99 value (the concentration inhibiting 
99% of intra-macrophage parasite growth in vitro) for the duration of the dosing period

 (Extended Data Fig. 1a). Characterization of efficacy of ten analogues in the series at various 
doses revealed a significant correlation (r2=0.89, p<0.01) between i) the ratio of mean free 
plasma compound concentration to the L. donovani EC90 value and ii) reduction of the liver 
parasite burden. We found that 90% parasite burden reduction in the mouse model was 
achieved when the mean free compound plasma concentration during treatment equaled a 
0.94-fold multiple of the L. donovani EC90 value (Fig. 2b). Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) 
affects about a million people per year, causing skin lesions that can resolve into scar 
tissue12. In parts of the Middle East, CL has reached epidemic proportions13. After footpad 
infection of BALB/c mice with the dermatotropic L. major strain14,15, treatment with 
GNF6702 at 10 mg/kg twice-daily caused a 5-fold decrease in footpad parasite burden and a 
reduction in footpad swelling (Fig. 2c). Both 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg twice-daily regimens of 
GNF6702 were superior to 30 mg/kg once-daily miltefosine regimen (p<0.01), which 
translates into ~2-fold higher miltefosine plasma concentration in mice than observed in 
clinical dosing11.
We further tested if GNF6702 can cure additional kinetoplastid parasite infections. An 
estimated 25% of the 8 million people infected with T. cruzi will develop chronic Chagas 
disease, manifesting as cardiac or intestinal dysfunction16,17. Benznidazole is broadly used 
for treatment of acute and indeterminate stages of Chagas disease in Latin America18,19. 
However, benznidazole has side-effects that frequently lead to treatment interruption18,20–22 
and a better tolerated drug is needed. To model treatment in the indeterminate disease stage, 
we infected mice with T. cruzi parasites and began treatment 35 days after infection, when 
the immune system of the mice had controlled parasite burden23. We increased the parasite 
detection sensitivity by immunosuppressing the mice after 20 days of treatment23,24. In this 
model, GNF6702 dosed twice-daily at 10 mg/kg matched the efficacy of benznidazole at 
100 mg/kg once-daily; all but one treated mice had no detectable parasites in blood, colon or 
heart tissue, even after 4 weeks of immunosuppression (Fig. 2d).
Finally, we tested GNF6702 in a mouse model of stage II sleeping sickness (human African 
trypanosomiasis - HAT)25. Mortality of stage II HAT is caused by infection of the CNS and, 
in this mouse model, luciferase-expressing T. brucei parasites establish a CNS infection by 
day 21 post-infection. GNF6702 was administered at 100 mg/kg once-daily to account for 
low exposure in the brain relative to the plasma (~10%, Extended Data Fig. 1b). Diminazene 
aceturate, a stage I drug that poorly crosses the blood-brain barrier, effected apparent 
clearance of parasites from the blood after a single dose, but did not prevent parasite 
recrudescence 21 days later. By contrast, treatment with GNF6702 for seven days caused a 
sustained clearance of parasites (days 42 and 92 post-infection in Fig. 2e, Extended Data 
Fig. 2a, Supplementary Information Tables 4 and 5). Significantly, mice treated with 
GNF6702 had no detectable parasites in the brain at termination of the experiment, though 
parasites were clearly detected in the brains of mice treated with diminazene aceturate 
(Extended Data Fig. 2b, Supplementary Information Table 6).
As GNF6702 showed compelling efficacy in four mouse models of kinetoplastid infections: 
VL, CL, Chagas disease and stage II HAT, we reasoned that mechanistic studies of 
GNF6702 might identify a pan-kinetoplastid drug target that could inform target-based drug 
discovery efforts. We attempted to evolve L. donovani strains resistant to GNF3943 and

 GNF8000 (early analogues from the series, Extended Data Fig. 3) through 12 months of 
parasite culture under drug pressure without success. However, we were able to select two 
drug-resistant T. cruzi epimastigote isolates, one resistant to GNF3943, and another to 
GNF8000. Both T. cruzi lines exhibited at least 40-fold lower susceptibility to GNF6702 
than wild type T. cruzi (Extended Data Fig. 4a and 4b). Using whole genome sequencing, 
we found that the GNF3943-resistant line had a homozygous mutation encoding a 
substitution of isoleucine for methionine at amino acid 29 in the proteasome beta 4 subunit 
(PSMB4I29M/I29M) and a heterozygous mutation P82L in dynein heavy chain gene. The 
GNF8000-resistant line had a heterozygous F24L mutation in PSMB4, and four other 
heterozygous mutations (Extended Data Table 1). We focused our attention on the 
proteasome as a likely target for the compound series because we found two independent 
mutations in the PSMB4 gene, and because the proteasome is an essential enzyme in 
eukaryotic cells. We also note that the Plasmodium falciparum proteasome has recently been 
the target of promising drug discovery efforts for malaria26.
We first asked whether two prototypic inhibitors of mammalian proteasome, bortezomib and 
MG132, could also block T. cruzi growth. Indeed, both compounds inhibited T. cruzi 
epimastigote proliferation with sub-micromolar potency. However, in contrast to GNF6702, 
bortezomib and MG132 inhibited proliferation of the two resistant lines (PSMB4I29M/I29M, 
PSMB4wt/F24L) with comparable potency to the wild type parasites. Additionally, the 
PSMB4 mutant lines were not resistant to nifurtimox, an anti-kinetoplastid drug with an 
unrelated mechanism of action (Extended Data Fig. 4a and 4b). To determine whether the 
F24L mutation was sufficient to confer resistance to GNF6702, we engineered T. cruzi 
epimastigote lines that ectopically expressed either wild type or F24L-mutated PSMB4. 
Overexpression of PSMB4WT had little effect on the EC50 value for GNF6702, whereas 
overexpression of PSMB4F24L caused a greater than 10-fold reduction in GNF6702 potency, 
but not in that of bortezomib (Fig. 3a, Extended Data Fig. 4c). Previously, bortezomib was 
also shown to inhibit the growth of T. brucei, suggesting that proteasome activity is essential 
for growth in this parasite as well27. To test whether PSMB4F24L can rescue growth 
inhibition by GNF6702 in T. brucei, we engineered two parasite strains that ectopically 
expressed wild type and F24L-mutated PSMB4, respectively. Similar to T. cruzi, 
overexpression of PSMB4F24L in T. brucei conferred a high level of resistance to GNF6702 
(~70-fold shift in EC50 value), while having no effect on parasite susceptibility to 
bortezomib (Fig. 3b, Extended Data Fig. 4c).
We next asked whether GNF6702 could inhibit any of three T. cruzi proteasome proteolytic 
activities in biochemical assays. As predicted from the T. cruzi genome28, mass 
spectrometry analysis of purified T. cruzi proteasome identified seven alpha and seven beta 
proteasome subunits, including PSMB4 (Supplementary Tables 7 and 8). Using substrates 
that are specific for each of the chymotrypsin-like, trypsin-like and caspase-like proteolytic 
activities, we found that only the chymotrypsin-like activity of the T. cruzi proteasome was 
inhibited by GNF6702 (IC50=35 nM), while the other two activities were not affected 
(IC50>10 μM). In contrast, bortezomib inhibited the chymotrypsin-like (IC50=91 nM), the 
caspase-like (IC50=370 nM) and the trypsin-like (IC50=1.7 μM) activities. We further found 
that the chymotrypsin-like activity of the PSMB4I29M T. cruzi proteasome was at least 300-
fold less susceptible to GNF6702 (IC50>10 μM) and ~3-fold less susceptible to bortezomib

 (IC50=0.26 μM), while susceptibility of the other two mutant proteasome proteolytic 
activities to the two inhibitors were not affected (Fig. 4a, Extended Data Table 2).
We reasoned that if the primary mechanism of parasite growth inhibition by the compound 
series was through inhibition of the proteasome chymotrypsin-like activity, then the IC50 
values for this proteolytic activity should correlate with EC50 values for parasite 
proliferation. Indeed, a tight correlation between the two parameters was observed for L. 
donovani axenic amastigotes and T. brucei bloodstream form trypomastigotes (r2=0.78 and 
r2=0.67, respectively) over a 2,000-fold potency range for 317 analogues, thus indicating 
that inhibition of parasite proteasome activity was driving the anti-parasitic activity of these 
compounds. We observed a weaker correlation between IC50 and EC50 values for 
intracellular T. cruzi (r2=0.36, p<0.01), perhaps reflecting more complex cellular 
pharmacokinetics resulting from compounds having to access T. cruzi parasites within the 
cytosol of mammalian cells (Fig. 4b, Extended Data Fig. 5).
Both resistant T. cruzi lines retained sensitivity to bortezomib, which is a substrate-
competitive inhibitor, suggesting that GNF6702 might have an alternative mode of 
inhibition. A Lineweaver-Burk plot of chymotrypsin-like activity at increasing 
concentrations of peptide substrate showed that GNF6702 has a non-competitive mode of 
inhibition clearly distinct from the competitive mechanism described for MG132 and 
bortezomib29,30. We were also able to extend these observations to proteasome from L. 
donovani (Fig. 4c, Extended Data Table 3). We further note that GNF6702 had no 
measurable activity on the human proteasome (Fig. 4d, Extended Data Table 2). 
Interestingly, human proteasome beta 4 subunit has a methionine at the 29th amino acid 
position, mirroring the I29M mutation in the GNF3943-resistant T. cruzi line (Extended 
Data Fig. 6a).
In summary, GNF6702 blocks the chymotrypsin-like activity harbored by the beta 5 subunit 
without competing with substrate binding, and mutations in the beta 4 subunit, which is in 
direct physical contact with the beta 5 subunit, confer resistance to this inhibition. Next we 
used homology modeling of the T. cruzi proteasome to look for evidence of an allosteric 
inhibitor binding site. In the T. cruzi proteasome model, the F24 and I29 beta 4 residues are 
positioned at the interface between the beta 4 and beta 5 subunits, on the outer limit of the 
beta 5 active site. Adjacent to these two beta 4 residues and the beta 5 active site is a 
plausible binding pocket for GNF6702 (Extended Data Fig. 6b and 6c).
Finally, we tested whether GNF6702 can inhibit proteasome activity in intact T. cruzi cells. 
Cellular proteins entering the proteasome degradation pathway are first tagged with 
ubiquitin, and proteasome inhibition results in intracellular accumulation of ubiquitylated 
proteins. Treatment of T. cruzi epimastigotes with GNF6702 led to significant buildup of 
ubiquitylated proteins (Extended Data Fig. 7a) with the half-maximal effect (EC50) achieved 
at 130 nM compound concentration (Extended Data Fig. 7c). This EC50 value correlated 
well with the half-maximal growth inhibitory concentration of GNF6702 on T. cruzi 
epimastigotes (EC50=150 nM; Extended Data Fig. 4b). For comparison, similar experiments 
with bortezomib yielded comparable inhibitor potencies in the two T. cruzi assays 
(ubiquitylation EC50=62 nM vs growth inhibition EC50=160 nM; Extended Data Fig. 4b and 
Khare et al.

 7c). We did not observe any detectable accumulation of ubiquitylated proteins in mammalian 
3T3 cells treated with GNF6702 (Extended Data Fig. 7b and 7c), further confirming high 
selectivity of this compound.
Validation of the parasite proteasome as the target of GNF6702 is supported through several 
lines of evidence: i) point mutations in the PSMB4 gene are sufficient to confer resistance to 
biochemical proteasome inhibition and cellular T. cruzi growth inhibition; ii) GNF6702 is a 
selective inhibitor of parasite proteasome activity and does not inhibit the human 
proteasome, mirroring the selective inhibition of parasite growth over mammalian cell 
growth; and iii) potency of GNF6702 and analogues in parasite proteasome assays predict 
potency in parasite growth inhibition assays.
In this work we show that in mouse disease models, GNF6702 was able to eradicate 
parasites from diverse niches that included the cytosol (T. cruzi), phagolysosome (L. 
donovani, L. major) of infected host cells, and brain (T. brucei). GNF6702 has also good 
pharmacokinetic properties, and the compound did not show activity in panels of human 
receptor, enzyme and ion channel assays (Supplementary Tables 9–11). Going forward, 
GNF6702, or analogues thereof, has potential to yield a new treatment for several 
kinetoplastid infections and it is currently being evaluated in preclinical toxicity studies. It is 
unclear if the clinical utility of GNF6702 could extend to the treatment of stage II HAT as 
GNF6702 was tested in the HAT mouse model only at one high dose (100 mg/kg once-
daily). We also note that identification of a broadly active pan-kinetoplastid drug might not 
be feasible (or desirable) as such a drug would need to reach high concentrations in varied 
tissues/subcellular compartments, and might carry increased toxicity risk. Instead, 
alternative analogues from this series with different pharmacological profiles might be 
needed for treatment of different kinetoplastid infections. Nevertheless, there are only scarce 
resources for drug development in these diseases, and identification of a common target and 
chemical scaffold with potential across multiple indications provides new hope for improved 
treatment options for some of the world’s poorest people.
METHODS
Ethics statement for animal models
All procedures involving mice were performed in accordance with AAALAC standards or 
under UK Home Office regulations, and were reviewed and approved in accordance with the 
Novartis Animal Welfare Policy. Sample size was determined on the basis of the minimum 
number of animals required for good data distribution and statistics. Blinding was not 
possible in these experiments but animals were selected randomly for each group.
Determination of IC50, EC50, and CC50 values
Reported IC50/EC50/CC50 values were calculated by averaging IC50/EC50/CC50 values 
obtained from individual technical replicate experiments (n; specified in relevant Figure 
captions and Methods sub-sections). Each technical replicate experiment was performed on 
a different day with freshly prepared reagents. Reported standard errors of mean (s.e.m.) 
were calculated using IC50/EC50/CC50 values determined in individual technical replicate

 experiments. To calculate IC50/EC50/CC50 values, measured dose response values were 
fitted with 4-parameter logistic function y=A+(B−A)/(1+(x/C)^D) (model 201, XLfit, 
IDBS), where x refers to compound concentration and y corresponds to an assay readout 
value.
Leishmania donovani axenic amastigote growth inhibition assay
RPMI 1640 medium (HyClone) was supplemented with 20% heat-inactivated fetal bovine 
serum (Omega Scientific), 23 μM folic acid (Sigma-Aldrich), 100 μM adenosine (Sigma-
Aldrich), 22 mM D-glucose (Sigma-Aldrich), 4 mM L-glutamine (Hyclone), 25 mM 2-(4-
morpholino) ethanesulfonic acid (Sigma-Aldrich) and 100 IU penicillin/100 μg/mL 
streptomycin (HyClone), and adjusted to pH= 5.5 with 6 M hydrochloric acid (Fisher 
Scientific) at 37 °C. Leishmania donovani MHOM/SD/62/1S-CL2D axenic amastigotes 
were cultured in 10 mL of this medium (Axenic Amastigote Medium) in T75 CELL-STAR 
flasks (Greiner Bio-One) at 37 °C/5% CO2 and passaged once a week.
To determine compound growth inhibitory potency on L. donovani axenic amastigotes, 100 
nL of serially diluted compounds in DMSO were transferred to the wells of white, solid 
bottom 384-well plates (Greiner Bio-One) by Echo 555 acoustic liquid handling system 
(Labcyte). Then, 1 × 103 of L. donovani axenic amastigotes in 40 μL of Axenic Amastigote 
Medium were added to each well, and plates were incubated for 48 hours at 37 °C/5% CO2. 
Parasite numbers in individual plate wells were determined through quantification of 
intracellular ATP. The CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability reagent (Promega) was added 
to plate wells, and ATP-dependent luminescence signal was measured on an EnVision 
MultiLabel Plate Reader (Perkin Elmer). Luminescence values in wells with compounds 
were divided by the average luminescence value of the plate DMSO controls, and used for 
calculation of compound EC50 values as described above.
Axenic amastigote EC50 values shown in Fig. 4b correspond to means of 2 technical 
replicates.
Isolation and maintenance of Leishmania donovani splenic amastigotes
Female BALB/cJ mice (Envigo) infected with L. donovani MHOM/ET/67/HU3 (ATCC) for 
50–80 days were euthanized, and infected spleens were removed and weighed. The weight 
of an infected spleen ranged from 300 to 600 mg. For comparison, spleens from non-
infected age-matched BALB/cJ mice weighed ~100 mg. Infected spleens were washed in 
Axenic Amastigote Medium (composition described above) and placed into Falcon 50 mL 
conical centrifuge tubes (Fisher Scientific) containing ice-cold Axenic Amastigote Medium 
(15 mL per infected spleen). Spleens were homogenized on ice in a Dounce homogenizer 
and centrifuged at 200 × g for 15 minutes at 4 °C to remove tissue debris. Leishmania 
donovani amastigotes present in the supernatant were pelleted by centrifugation at 1,750 × g 
for 15 min at 4 °C and re-suspended either in Axenic Amastigote Medium (when used for in 
vitro macrophage infections) or in Hanks’ Balanced Salt Solution (when used for mouse 
infections; Hyclone). Suspensions of splenic amastigotes were kept on ice and used for in 
vitro or in vivo infections within 2–3 hours. To propagate L. donovani amastigotes in vivo, 6

 to 7 weeks old female BALB/cJ mice were infected with 8 × 107 purified splenic 
amastigotes in 200 μL of Hanks’ Balanced Salt Solution by tail vein injection.
Leishmania donovani intra-macrophage amastigote growth inhibition assay
In vitro compound potencies on intra-macrophage L. donovani MHOM/ET/67/HU3 were 
determined using primary murine peritoneal macrophages infected with L. donovani splenic 
amastigotes. Primary macrophages were elicited in female BALB/c mice for 72 hours 
following the injection of 500 μL of sterile aqueous 2% starch (J. T. Baker) solution into the 
mouse peritoneal cavity. The protocol used for isolation of peritoneal macrophages was 
described in detail previously31. The isolated macrophages were re-suspended in 
Macrophage Infection Medium (RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 2 mM L-
glutamine, 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 10 mM sodium pyruvate (Hyclone), and 
100 IU penicillin/100 μg/mL streptomycin), and 50 μL of macrophage suspension (8 × 105 
macrophages/mL) were added to microscopy-grade, clear-bottom, black 384-well plates 
(Greiner Bio-One). Following overnight incubation at 37 °C/5% CO2, plate wells were 
washed with Macrophage Infection Medium to remove non-adherent cells using ELx405 
Select microplate washer (BioTek), and then filled with 40 μL of Macrophage Infection 
Medium. Leishmania donovani HU3 splenic amastigotes isolated from infected spleens were 
re-suspended in Macrophage Infection Medium at a concentration of 6 × 107 cells/mL, and 
10 μL of the suspension were added to assay plate wells containing adherent macrophages. 
After a 24-hour infection period at 37 °C/5% CO2, plate wells were washed with 
Macrophage Infection Medium to remove residual extracellular parasites and re-filled with 
50 μL of the medium. Leishmania donovani-infected macrophages were subsequently 
treated with DMSO-dissolved compounds (0.5% final DMSO concentration in the assay 
medium) in dose response for 120 hours at 37 °C/5% CO2. Next, treated macrophages were 
washed with the phosphate-buffered saline buffer (PBS; Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 
0.5 mM magnesium chloride (Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.5 mM calcium chloride (Sigma-
Aldrich), fixed with 0.4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS, permeabilized with 
0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS, and stained with SYBR Green I nucleic acid 
stain(Invitrogen, 1:100,000 dilution in PBS) overnight at 4 °C. Image collection and 
enumeration of macrophage cells and intracellular L. donovani amastigotes was performed 
using the OPERA QEHS automated confocal microscope system equipped with 20x water 
immersion objective (Evotec Technologies) and the OPERA Acapella software (Evotec 
Technologies) as described previously32.
All reported intra-macrophage L. donovani EC50 values were calculated from at least 3 
technical replicates (n= 3 or n= 4; specified in relevant Figure captions).
Trypanosoma brucei growth inhibition assay

 added components refer to those in complete HMI-9 medium. The parasites were cultured in 
10 mL of HMI-9 medium in T75 CELL-STAR tissue culture flasks at 37 °C/5% CO2.
To determine compound growth inhibitory potency on T. brucei bloodstream form parasites, 
100 nL of serially diluted compounds in DMSO were transferred to the wells of white, solid 
bottom 384-well plates (Greiner Bio-One) by Echo 555 acoustic liquid handling system. 
Then, 5 × 103 of T. brucei parasites in 40 μL of HMI-9 medium were added to each well, 
and the plates were incubated for 48 hours at 37 °C/5% CO2. Parasite numbers in individual 
plate wells were determined through quantification of intracellular ATP amount. The 
CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability reagent was added to plate wells, and ATP-
dependent luminescence signal was measured on an EnVision MultiLabel Plate Reader. 
Luminescence values in wells with compounds were divided by the average luminescence 
value of the plate DMSO controls, and used for calculation of compound EC50 values as 
described above.
Trypanosoma brucei EC50 values shown in Fig. 1 and Extended Data Fig. 3 correspond to 
means of 4 technical replicates.
Trypanosoma cruzi amastigote growth inhibition assay
NIH 3T3 fibroblast cells (ATCC) were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Life 
Technologies) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 100 IU 
penicillin/100 μg/mL streptomycin at 37 °C/5% CO2. Trypanosoma cruzi Tulahuen parasites 
constitutively expressing Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase33 were maintained in tissue 
culture as an infection in NIH 3T3 fibroblast cells. Briefly, 2 × 107 T. cruzi trypomastigotes 
were used to infect 6 × 105 NIH 3T3 cells growing in T75 CELL-STAR tissue culture flasks 
and cultured at 37 °C/5% CO2 until proliferating intracellular parasites lysed host 3T3 cells 
and were released into the culture medium (typically 6–7 days). During the infection, the 
tissue culture medium was changed every two days. Number of T. cruzi trypomastigotes 
present in one mL of medium was determined using a hemocytometer.
To determine compound potency on intracellular T. cruzi amastigotes, NIH 3T3 cells were 
re-suspended in phenol red-free RPMI 1640 medium containing 3% heat-inactivated fetal 
bovine serum and 100 IU penicillin/100 μg/mL streptomycin, seeded at 1,000 cells/well (40 
μL) in white, clear bottom 384-well plates (Greiner Bio-One), and incubated overnight at 
37 °C/5% CO2. The following day, 100 nL of each compound in DMSO were transferred to 
individual plate wells by Echo 555 acoustic liquid handling system. After one hour 
incubation, 1 × 106 of tissue culture-derived T. cruzi trypomastigotes, in 10 μL of phenol 
red-free RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 3% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 
100 IU penicillin/100 μg/mL streptomycin were added to each well. Plates were then 
incubated for 6 days at 37 °C/5% CO2. Intracellular T. cruzi parasites were quantified by 
measuring the activity of parasite-expressed beta-galactosidase. Ten microliters of a 
chromogenic beta-galactosidase substrate solution (0.6 mM chlorophenol red-β-D-
galactopyranoside/0.6% NP-40 in PBS; both reagents from Calbiochem) were added to each 
well and incubated for 2 hours at room temperature. After incubation, absorption was 
measured at 570 nM on SpectraMax M2 plate reader (Molecular Devices). Measured 
absorbance values in wells with compounds were divided by the average absorbance value

correspond to means of 4 technical replicates.
Trypanosoma cruzi epimastigote proliferation assay
Trypanosoma cruzi CL epimastigotes were continuously passaged in LIT medium 
containing 9 g/L liver infusion broth (Difco), 5 g/L bacto-tryptose (Difco), 1 g/L sodium 
chloride, 8 g/L dibasic sodium phosphate (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.4 g/L potassium chloride 
(Sigma-Aldrich), 1 g/L D-glucose, 10 % heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 10 ng/mL 
of hemin (Sigma-Aldrich). The medium was adjusted to pH= 7.2 with 6 M hydrochloric 
acid. The parasites were cultured in 10 mL of LIT medium in T75 CELL-STAR tissue 
culture flasks at 27 °C.
To determine compound growth inhibitory potency on T. cruzi epimastigotes, 100 nL of 
serially diluted compounds in DMSO were transferred to the wells of white, solid bottom 
384-well plates (Greiner Bio-One) by an Echo 555 acoustic liquid handling system. Then, 5 
× 103 of T. cruzi epimastigotes in 40 μL of LIT medium were added to each well, and the 
plates were incubated for 7 days at 27 °C. Parasite numbers in individual plate wells were 
determined through quantification of intracellular ATP amount. The CellTiter-Glo 
luminescent cell viability reagent was added to plate wells, and ATP-dependent 
luminescence signal was measured on an EnVision MultiLabel Plate Reader. Luminescence 
values in wells with compounds were divided by the average luminescence value of the plate 
DMSO controls, and used for calculation of compound EC50 values as described above.
Trypanosoma cruzi epimastigote EC50 values shown in Extended Data Fig. 4 correspond to 
means of 3 technical replicates.
Mouse fibroblast NIH 3T3 growth inhibition assay
NIH 3T3 fibroblast cells were maintained in RPMI medium 1640 with glutamine (Life 
Technologies) supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 100 IU 
penicillin/100 μg/mL streptomycin (3T3 Medium) at 37 °C/5% CO2. NIH 3T3 fibroblast 
cells were purchased from ATCC. We did not perform cell line authentication and did not 
test the cells for mycoplasma contamination. This cell line is not listed in the database of 
commonly misidentified cell lines maintained by ICLAC and NCBI Biosample.
To determine compound potency, NIH 3T3 cells re-suspended in 3T3 medium were seeded 
at 1,000 cells/well (50 μL) in white 384-well plates (Greiner Bio-One) and incubated 
overnight at 37 °C/5% CO2. The following day, 100 nL of each compound in DMSO were 
transferred to individual plate wells by Echo 555 acoustic liquid handling system and plates 
were incubated for five days at 37 °C/5% CO2. Cell numbers in individual plate wells were 
determined through quantification of intracellular ATP amount. The CellTiter-Glo 
luminescent cell viability reagent was added to plate wells, and ATP-dependent 
luminescence signal was measured on an EnVision MultiLabel Plate Reader. Luminescence

 values in wells with compounds were divided by the average luminescence value of the plate 
DMSO controls, and used for calculation of compound CC50 values as described above.
NIH 3T3 CC50 values shown in Fig. 1 and Extended Data Fig. 3 correspond to means of 4 
technical replicates.
Primary macrophage cytotoxicity assay
Primary macrophage cell viability was determined on mouse peritoneal macrophages 
infected with L. donovani and was expressed as the ratio of the number of macrophage cells 
in wells treated with a compound to those in wells treated with DMSO. The number of 
macrophage cells in wells was determined by high content microscopy as described 
previously32.
All reported macrophage CC50 values were calculated from 4 technical replicates (n= 4; also 
specified in Figure 1 and Extended Data Figure 3 captions).
Selection of GNF3934- and GNF8000-resistant T. cruzi mutants
T. cruzi epimastigotes cultures resistant to GNF3943 and GNF8000 were generated using a 
methodology described previously32. Briefly, epimastigotes were initially cultured in the 
presence of compound concentration equivalent to its EC20 value (GNF3943 EC20= 1.5 μM 
and GNF8000 EC20= 0.2 μM in 0.2% DMSO) or 0.2% DMSO (control). Once a week, 
parasites were counted and growth rates were determined. If the parasite cultures exhibited a 
reduced growth rate compared to 0.2% DMSO-treated parasites, epimastigotes were cultured 
at the same compound concentration. Once the growth rates matched that of the control 
epimastigote culture (0.2% DMSO), parasites were transferred into medium containing two-
fold higher compound concentration. The process was repeated until significant resistance 
was achieved (~10- to 20-fold increase in corresponding EC50 value). The time required for 
generation of cultures with such a level of resistance was approximately five months. 
Resistant clones were isolated via cloning by limiting dilution, and two independent clones 
were analyzed by whole genome sequencing.
T. cruzi whole genome sequencing
Chromosomal DNA isolation from GNF3943- and GNF8000-resistant T. cruzi clones, whole 
genome sequencing and sequence analysis were performed as described previously32. 
Sequencing reads were aligned to the T. cruzi CL Brenner genome34.
Generation of T. cruzi strains ectopically expressing proteasome beta 4 subunit variants
PSMB4 TcCLB503891.100 was amplified from T. cruzi CL Brenner genomic DNA using 
KOD Hot Start DNA Polymerase (EMD Millipore), and sense (5′-
AAAGCGGCCGCATGTCGGAGACAACCATTG-3) and antisense (5-
CCATGATCTTGATGTAATATAAGGCATTCAGCCCTGCTG-3) primers. The PSMB4F24L 
gene was generated from the wild type PSMB4 construct by site-directed mutagenesis using 
mutagenic sense (5-CAGCAGGGCTGAATGCCTTATATTACATCAAGATCATGG-3′) and 
antisense (5′-CCATGATCTTGATGTAATATAAGGCATTCAGCCCTGCTG-3′) primers 
and QuikChange II Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene). The sequences of the wild

 type and mutant PSMB4 genes were verified by sequencing and both gene versions were 
subcloned into the T. cruzi expression vector pTcIndex1 under control of a T7 promoter35. 
Trypanosoma cruzi CL Brenner epimastigotes were first transfected as described 
previously36 with the pLEW13 plasmid37 harboring a tetracycline-inducible T7 RNA 
polymerase gene. Transfected epimastigotes were selected in medium supplemented with 
neomycin (G418) at 500 μg/ml, and then transfected a second time with either pTcIndex1-
PSMB4wt or pTcIndex1-PSMB4F24L plasmid. Double transfected epimastigotes were 
selected in the presence of 500 μg/mL of G418 (Sigma-Aldrich) and 500 μg/mL of 
hygromycin (Sigma-Aldrich). Susceptibility of double transfected epimastigote cell lines to 
compounds was assessed using induced (+5 mg/mL of tetracycline) and non-induced 
parasite cultures after five days of compound treatment. Parasite viability was determined 
with AlamarBlue (ThermoFisher Scientific).
Reported EC50 values for T. cruzi epimastigotes ectopically expressing PSMB4 proteins 
were calculated from 3 technical replicates (n= 3; also specified in the Figure 3a caption).
Generation of T. brucei strains ectopically expressing proteasome beta 4 subunit variants
PSMB4 (Tb927.10.4710) was amplified from T. brucei Lister 427 genomic DNA using PCR 
SuperMix High Fidelity (Invitrogen), sense (5′-
GCAAGCTTATGGCAGAGACGACTATCGG-3) and antisense (5′-
GCGGATCCCTAGCTTACAGATTGCACTC-3′) primers. The PSMB4F24L gene was 
generated from the wild type PSMB4 construct by site-directed mutagenesis using 
mutagenic sense (5′-gctgcggggttaaatgcgttatactacattaagataacgg-3′), antisense (5′-
ccgttatcttaatgtagtataacgcatttaaccccgcagc-3′) primers and QuikChange II Site-Directed 
Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene). The sequences of the wild type and mutant PSMB4 genes 
were verified by sequencing and both gene versions were cloned into the T. brucei 
expression vector pHD1034 under control of a ribosomal RNA promoter. Transfected T. 
brucei Lister 427 cells were selected in medium supplemented with puromycin at 1 μg/ml. 
Susceptibility of transfected T. brucei cell lines to compounds were assessed after 2 days of 
compound treatment. Parasite viability was determined with CellTiter-Glo.
Reported EC50 values for T. brucei parasites ectopically expressing PSMB4 proteins were 
calculated from 3 technical replicates (n= 3; also specified in the Figure 3b caption).
Purification of parasite 20S proteasomes
T. cruzi CL epimastigotes, L. donovani MHOM/SD/62/1S-CL2D axenic amastigotes and T. 
brucei Lister 27 bloodstream form trypomastigotes were grown to log phase and harvested 
by centrifugation. The corresponding cell pellets were stored at −80 °C until further use. 
Prior to purification, 10 g of cell pellets were thawed, re-suspended in lysis buffer (50 mM 
Tris-HCl pH = 7.5, 1 mM TCEP, 5 mM EDTA, and 10 μM E-64), and lysed by passing cell 
suspension three times through a needle (22 gauge) and by subsequent three freeze/thaw 
cycles. The lysate was first cleared of cellular debris by two centrifugation steps (15,000 × g 
at 4 °C for 15 minutes followed by 40,000 × g at 4 °C for 60 minutes) and then fractionated 
through ammonium sulfate precipitation. The protein fraction precipitated between 45% and 
65% of ammonium sulfate saturation was re-suspended in 25 mM Tris-HCl pH = 7.5, 1 mM

 TCEP buffer, and dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against the same buffer. Proteasomes were 
further purified by anion exchange chromatography (Resource Q column, GE Healthcare 
Life Sciences) and size exclusion chromatography (Superose 6 column, GE Healthcare Life 
Sciences) as described elsewhere38. Active fractions from the latter purification step were 
pooled and used in proteasome biochemical assays.
Subunit composition analysis of purified T. cruzi 20S proteasome by LC/MS/MS
Purified T. cruzi proteasome sample was buffer-exchanged and concentrated into 100 mM 
trimethylamine bicarbonate-HCl pH= 8.0, 150 mM NaCl buffer using a 10 kDa molecular 
weight cut-off micro-concentrator (Milipore Amicon Ultra). The resulting proteasome 
sample (200 μl, 1 mg/ml) was mixed with 5 μl of a TMTsixplex reagent (Pierce). After 60 
second incubation to label primary amines, the reaction was stopped by adding 25 μl of 5% 
hydroxylamine. The labeled sample was run on 4–20% Bis-Tris PAGE gel (Invitrogen) to 
separate polypeptides. The gel was stained with eStain 2.0 (GenScript). Stained protein 
bands were cut out and in-gel digested separately with elastase (Promega) and asparaginase 
(Roche). Peptides generated by the digestions were resolved by HPLC using a vented 
column setup with a 2 cm Poros 10 R2 (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) self-packed pre-
column, and a PepMap Easy-Spray C18 analytical column (15 cm × 75 μm ID, Thermo 
Scientific). Resin-bound proteolytic fragments were eluted with 2 to 40% acetonitrile/0.1% 
formic acid operated at 300 nL/min for 120 min. Spectra of eluted peptide species were 
determined by a column-coupled Q Exactive hybrid quadrupole orbitrap mass spectrometer 
(Thermo Scientific). Proteome Discoverer v1.4 software (Thermo Scientific) was used to 
search the T. cruzi genome28 with identified spectra for presence of 20S proteasome subunits 
(Supplementary Table 7). Search parameters included fixed carbamidomethyl modification 
of cysteine, and variable oxidation of methionine, deamidation of asparagine, pyro-glu of N-
terminal glutamine, and TMT(6-plex) modification of lysine residues.
Measuring proteasome proteolytic activities
The activity of purified parasite and human 20S proteasomes was monitored by measuring 
cleavage of various rhodamine-labelled fluorogenic substrates. Purified 20S proteasomes 
were diluted in proteasome assay buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 1 mM dithiothreitol 
(Sigma-Aldrich), 10 mM sodium chloride, 25 mM potassium chloride, 1 mM magnesium 
chloride, 0.05% (w/v) CHAPS (Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.9% DMSO) at a final concentration of 
162 nM (parasite proteasomes) or 25 nM (human proteasome), and pre-incubated with 
compound (40 nL; 0.2% final DMSO concentration) for 1 hour. Next, the following 
substrates (Biosynthan GmbH) were added at 3 μM final concentration to monitor specific 
proteolytic activities (Suc-LLVY-Rh110-dPro: chymotrypsin-like activity; Ac-RLR-Rh110-
dPro: trypsin-like activity; Ac-GPLD-Rh110-dPro: caspase-like activity). The reaction was 
allowed to proceed for two hours at room temperature and fluorescence as a measure of 
purified 20S proteasome activity was monitored using the EnVision® plate reader 
(excitation at 485 nm/emission at 535 nm). Km and Ki values were calculated using 
GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software) ‘Non-competitive enzyme inhibition’ function.

Monitoring accumulation of ubiquitylated proteins in intact cells
Growing T. cruzi epimastigotes were seeded into 24-well tissue culture plate (1 × 107 
cells/per well) in LIT medium and treated for 2–12 hours with DMSO (0.2%) or various 
concentrations of bortezomib and GNF6702 at 27 °C. Following the treatment, parasites 
were collected by centrifugation (3,500 g for 6 minutes) and washed twice with phosphate-
buffered saline (PBS). Epimastigotes were lysed by resuspending washed cells in a buffer 
containing 50 mM Tris-HCl pH= 7.4, 150 mM sodium chloride, 1% CHAPS, 20 μM E-64 
(Sigma-Aldrich), 10 mM EDTA(Sigma-Aldrich), 5 mM N-ethylmaleimide(Sigma-Aldrich), 
1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma-Aldrich), 10 μg/mL leupeptin (Sigma-Aldrich), 
10 μg/mL aprotinin (Sigma-Aldrich), and incubating the suspension on ice for 20 minutes. 
Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 21,000 g for 30 min at 4 °C.
For 3T3 cells, 2 × 105 cells/well were seeded into 24-well tissue culture plates in RPMI 
medium 1640 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, and incubated 
overnight at 37 °C to allow cells to attach. Attached cells were treated for 2 hours with 
DMSO (0.25%) or various concentrations of bortezomib and GNF6702. Treated cells were 
washed twice with PBS and then lysed by incubating cells in modified RIPA buffer (50 mM 
Tris-HCl pH= 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 0.2% sodium dodecylsulfate, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM 
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/mL aprotinin, 5 μg/mL leupeptin) for 30 min at 4 °C. 
Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 21,000 g for 30 min at 4 °C.
Protein concentration in cell extracts was determined with BCA assay (ThermoFisher), and 
10 μg of cell extracts were loaded on NuPAGE Novex 4–12% Bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen). 
After electrophoresis, resolved proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. 
Ubiquitylated proteins were detected with polyclonal anti-ubiquitin primary antibody 
(Proteintech, catalogue number 10201-2-AP) and rabbit anti-mouse IgG-peroxidase 
antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, catalogue number A0545), and then imaged using ECL Prime 
Western Blotting Detection Reagent (Amersham) on Chemidoc XR+ imaging system 
(BioRad). Collected western blot images were quantified using Image Lab software 
(BioRad). Briefly, rectangles of identical size and shape were drawn around each blot lane to 
include inside the shape all ubiquitylated protein bands within 17 – 198 kDa molecular mass 
range. Next, integrated signal intensities within the rectangles (reported by the Image Lab 
software) were used for calculation of EC50 values. Three technical replicate experiments 
(n= 3) for each different dose response experiment (GNF6702 on T. cruzi epimastigotes; 
GNF6702 on 3T3 cells; bortezomib on T. cruzi epimastigotes; bortezomib on 3T3 cells) 
were performed.
Trypanosoma cruzi proteasome modeling studies
The homology model of T. cruzi 20S proteasome was built using ‘Prime’ protein structure 
prediction program (Schrödinger) and X-ray structure of bovine 20S proteasome (pdb 
accession code 1IRU)39 as the template. The model was subjected to restrained

 minimization to relieve inter-chain clashes. ‘SiteMap’ program (Schrödinger) was used to 
identify pockets on a protein surface suitable for small molecule binding. Flexible ligand 
docking was performed using ‘Glide 5.8’ (Schrödinger). The grid box was centered in a 
middle of the identified pocket and extended by 10 Å, with outer box extending additional 
20Å. The ligand was docked using the standard precision (SP) algorithm and scored using 
‘GlideScore’ (Schrödinger). The GNF6702 GlideScore is equal to −8.5.
Receptor, enzyme and ion channel assays
GNF6702 profiling was performed at 10 μM concentration in a selectivity panel at Eurofins 
(www.eurofinspanlabs.com/Catalog/AssayCatalog/AssayCatalog.aspx). Listed values % 
change in the assay readout relative to the DMSO control. To determine inhibition of a 
subset of human tyrosine kinases by GNF6702, the inhibitor was profiled on a panel of 
Ba/F3 cell lines expressing individual Tel-activated kinases as described previously40. All 
assays were performed as single technical repeats.
Determination of GNF6702 thermodynamic solubility
The solubility of GNF6702 was assessed in a high throughput thermodynamic solubility 
assay as described previously41. First, 25 μL of GNF6702 DMSO solutions were transferred 
to individual wells of a 96-well plate. DMSO was evaporated and 250 μL of 67 mM 
potassium phosphate buffer pH 6.8 were added to yield projected final compound 
concentrations from 1 μM to 100 μM. The plate was sealed to prevent solvent loss and 
shaken for 24 hours at room temperature. The plate was then filtered to remove non-
dissolved material. Concentration of GNF6702 in individual plate wells was determined by 
measuring solution UV absorbance with reference to a GNF6702 calibration curve.
Determination of GNF6702 permeability in Caco-2 assay
A 96-Multiwell Insert System (BD Biosciences) was used for the Caco-2 cell culture and 
permeability assay as described previously42. Caco-2 cells were seeded onto insert wells at a 
density of 1.48 × 105 cells per ml and allowed to grow for 19–23 days before assays. To 
measure both absorptive (apical to basolateral [A-B]) and secretory (basolateral to apical [B-
A]) compound transport, a solution of GNF6702 at 10 μM concentration in 0.5% DMSO 
were added to donor wells. The plate was incubated at 37°C for 2 hours, with samples taken 
at the beginning and end of the incubation from both donor and acceptor wells. The 
concentration of GNF6702 was determined by LC-MS/MS.
Apparent drug permeability (Papp) was calculated using the following equation:
where dQ/dt is the total amount of a test compound transported to the acceptor chamber per 
unit of time (nmol/s), A is the surface area of the transport membrane (0.0804 cm2), Cin is 
the initial compound concentration in the donor chamber (10 μM), and Papp is expressed as 
cm/s).

 Determination of human CYP450 inhibition by GNF6702
Extent of inhibition of major human CYP450 isoforms 2C9, 2D6 and 3A4 by GNF6702 was 
determined using pooled human liver microsomes and the known specific substrates of 
various CYP450 isoforms: diclofenac (5 μM), bufuralol (5 μM), midazolam (5 μM), and 
testosterone (50 μM). Probe substrate concentrations were used at concentrations equal to 
their reported Km values. The CYP450 inhibition assays with probe substrates diclofenac 
(2C9) or midazolam (3A4) were incubated at 37 °C for 5 to 10 minutes using a microsomal 
protein concentration of 0.05 mg/mL. Probe substrates bufuralol (2D6) and testosterone 
(3A4) were incubated at 37 °C for 20 minutes using microsomal concentration 0.5 mg/mL. 
The test concentrations of GNF6702 ranged from 0.5 to 25 μM in the presence of 1% 
DMSO. The reactions were initiated by adding NADPH (1 mM final concentration; Sigma-
Aldrich) after a 5-min pre-incubation. Incubations were terminated by the addition of 300 
μL of acetonitrile to 100 μL of a sample. No significant cytochrome P450 inhibition was 
observed. Extent of CYP450 isoform inhibition was determined by quantifying residual 
concentrations of individual CYP450 substrate probes at the end of reactions by LC/MS/MS.
Determination of GNF6702 in vitro metabolic stability
The intrinsic metabolic stability of GNF6702 was determined in mouse and human liver 
microsomes using the compound depletion approach and LC/MS/MS quantification. The 
assay measured the rate and extent of metabolism of GNF6702 by measuring the 
disappearance of the compound. The assay determined GNF6702 in vitro half-life (T1/2) and 
hepatic extraction ratios (ER) as described previously43. GNF6702 was incubated for 30 
minutes at 1.0 μM concentration in a buffer containing 1.0 mg/mL liver microsomes. 
Samples (50 μL) were collected at 0, 5, 15 and 30 minutes and immediately quenched by 
addition of 150 μL of ice-cold acetonitrile/methanol/water mixture (8/1/1). Quantification of 
GNF6702 in samples was performed by LC/MS/MS, and the in vitro intrinsic clearance was 
determined using the substrate depletion method. The intrinsic clearance, CLint was 
calculated using the following equation:
where T1/2 is the in vitro half-life, V (μL) is the reaction volume, and M (mg) is the 
microsomal protein amount. Finally the hepatic extraction ratio is calculated as:
where CLh = hepatic clearance, Qh = hepatic blood flow.
Clh was calculated using the following equation:
where fu = fraction unbound to protein (assumed to be 1).

 Pharmacokinetic studies
An outline of various in vitro and in vivo DMPK assays used in this study for compound 
profiling was summarized previously44. The pharmacokinetic properties of GNF compounds 
and calculation of pharmacokinetic parameters was performed as described previously23. 
Mean compound plasma concentrations were calculated from fitted functions approximating 
compound plasma profile throughout 8 days of dosing. Blinding was not possible in these 
experiments.
Bioanalysis of GNF6702 in plasma
Plasma concentration of GNF6702 was quantified using a LC/MS/MS assay. Solution of 20 
ng/mL of verapamil hydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich) in acetonitrile/methanol mixture (3/1 by 
volume), was used as an internal standard. Twenty microliters of plasma samples were 
mixed with 200 μl of internal standard solution. The samples were vortexed and then 
centrifuged in an Eppendorf Centrifuge 5810R (Eppendorf) at 4,000 rpm for 5 minutes at 
4 °C to remove precipitated plasma proteins. The supernatants (150 μl) were transferred to a 
96-well plate and mixed with 150 μl H2O. The samples (10 μl) were then injected onto a 
Zorbax SB-C8 analytical column (2.1 × 30 mm, 3.5 μm; Agilent Technologies) and 
separated using a three step gradient (1st step: 1.5 mL of 0.05% formic acid in 10% 
acetonitrile; 2nd step: 0.5 mL of 0.05% formic acid in 100% acetonitrile; 3rd step: 0.5 mL of 
0.05% formic acid in 10% acetonitrile) at flow rate of 700 μl/min. GNF6702 and verapamil 
were eluted at retention time 1.19 and 1.17 minutes, respectively. The HPLC system, 
consisting of Agilent 1260 series binary pump (Agilent Technologies), Agilent 1260 series 
micro vacuum degasser (Agilent Technologies) and CTC PAL-HTC-xt analytics 
autosampler (LEAP Technologies) was interfaced to a SCIEX API 4000 triple quadrupole 
mass spectrometer (Sciex). Mass spectrometry analysis was carried out using atmospheric 
pressure chemical ionization (APCI) in the positive ion mode. GNF6702 (430.07 > 333.20) 
and verapamil (455.16 > 164.90) peak integrations were performed using AnalystTM 1.5 
software (Sciex). The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) in plasma was 1.0 ng/mL. 
Samples were quantified using seven calibration standards (dynamic range 1 – 5,000 ng/mL) 
prepared in plasma and processed as described above.
Formulation of study drugs for in vivo efficacy experiments
All compounds administered to mice during efficacy experiments were formulated as 
suspensions in distilled water containing 0.5% methylcellulose (Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.5% 
Tween 80 (Sigma-Aldrich). During a treatment course, each mouse received 0.2 ml of drug 
suspension per dose by oral gavage.
Mouse model of visceral leishmaniasis
Female BALB/c mice (Envigo; 6–8 weeks old) were infected by tail vein injection with 4 × 
107 L. donovani MHOM/ET/67/HU3 splenic amastigotes (protocol number P11-319). Seven 
days after infection, animals were orally dosed for eight days with vehicle (0.5% 
methylcellulose/0.5% Tween 80, miltefosine (12 mg/kg once-daily; Sigma-Aldrich), or a 
GNF compound (twice-daily). On the first day of dosing, three mice were used for collection 
of blood for PK determination and euthanized afterwards. On the last day of dosing, PK

 samples were collected from remaining five mice, which were also used for determination of 
compound efficacy (n= 5 mice per group). Liver samples were collected from these five 
mice and L. donovani parasite burdens were quantified by qPCR as follows. Total DNA was 
extracted from drug-treated mice livers using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen). 
Two types of DNA were quantified in parallel using the TaqMan assay: L. donovani major 
surface glycoprotein gp63 (Ldon_GP63) and mouse GAPDH. L. donovani GP63 DNA was 
quantified with the following set of primers: TGCGGTTTATCCTCTAGCGATAT (forward), 
AGTCCATGAAGGCGGAGATG (reverse), and TGGCAGTACTTCACGGAC (TaqMan 
MGB probe, 5′-FAM-labeled reporter dye, non-fluorescent quencher). Mouse GAPDH 
DNA was quantified with the following set of primers: GCCGCCATGTTGCAAAC 
(forward primer), CGAGAGGAATGAGGTTAGTCACAA (reverse primer), and 
ATGAATGAACCGCCGTTAT (TaqMan MGB probe, 5′-FAM-labeled reporter dye, non-
fluorescent quencher). Each qPCR reaction (10 μL) included 5 μl of TaqMan Gene 
Expression Master Mix (Life Technologies), 0.5 μL of a 20X primer/probe mix (Life 
Technologies), and 4.5 μL (50 ng) of total DNA from liver samples. DNA amount was 
quantified using the Applied Biosystems 7900HT instrument. L. donovani parasite burden 
(RU: relative units) was expressed as the abundance of L. donovani GP63 DNA relative to 
the abundance of mouse GAPDH DNA.
Mouse footpad model of cutaneous leishmaniasis
L. major MHOM/SA/85/JISH118 metacyclic promastigotes were generated and purified by 
the peanut agglutinin method as described elsewhere45. To establish the L. major footpad 
infection, female BALB/c mice (Envigo; 6–8 weeks old; protocol number P11-319) were 
injected with suspension of L. major metacyclic promastigotes (1 × 106 parasites in 50 μL) 
into each hind footpad. After eight days of infection, animals were dosed with vehicle, 
miltefosine (30 mg/kg once-daily), or indicated regimens of GNF6702 for seven days (n=6 
mice per group). The progress of infection was monitored by measuring the size (length and 
thickness) of hind footpad swelling using digital calipers. At the end of the study, the mice 
were euthanized, and the footpad tissues were extracted and used for genomic DNA 
isolation with the DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit (Qiagen). The L. major footpad burden was 
determined by qPCR quantification of kinetoplastid minicircle DNA (forward primer: 5′-
TTTTACACCTCCCCCCAGTTT-3′; reverse primer: 5′-
CCCGTTCATAATTTCCCGAAA-3′; Taqman MGB probe: 5′-AGGCCAAAAATGG-3′, 
5′-FAM [6-carboxyfluorescein]-labeled reporter dye, non-fluorescent quencher). The 
amounts of mouse chromosomal DNA in extracted samples were quantified in parallel 
qPCR using a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) TaqMan assay as 
described for mouse VL model above. L. major burden in footpad was expressed as the ratio 
of kinetoplast minicircle DNA to mouse GAPDH. P values for the between-groups 
differences in efficacies were calculated with a Student’s paired t test with a two-tailed 
distribution.
Mouse model of Chagas disease
Compound efficacy in mouse model of Chagas disease was determined as described 
previously23. Female C57BL/6 mice (Envigo; 6–8 weeks old; protocol number P11-316) 
were infected by intraperitoneal injection with 103 tissue culture-derived T. cruzi CL

 trypomastigotes. Starting at 35 days after infection, the animals were dosed orally once-daily 
with 100 mg/kg benznidazole (Sigma-Aldrich) and indicated doses of GNF6702 (1, 3, and 
10 mg/kg twice-daily, n=8 per group) for 20 days. Ten days following the end of drug 
treatment, the mice underwent four cycles of cyclophosphamide immunosuppression, each 
cycle lasting one week. During each immunosuppression cycle, mice were dosed by oral 
gavage once-daily with 200 mg/kg cyclophosphamide (suspension in 0.5% methylcellulose/
0.5% Tween80 aqueous solution) on day 1 and day 4 of the cycle. After the fourth 
immunosuppression cycle, blood samples were collected from the orbital venous sinus of 
each mouse, mice were euthanized and heart and colon samples were collected. Samples 
from treated mice were used for extraction of total DNA using the High Pure PCR template 
preparation kit (Roche). The amounts of T. cruzi satellite DNA (195-bp fragment) in 
extracted DNA samples were quantified by real-time qPCR TaqMan assay (Life 
Technologies) with the following set of primers: AATTATGAATGGCGGGAGTCA 
(forward primer), CCAGTGTGTGAACACGCAAAC (reverse primer), and 
AGACACTCTCTTTCAATGTA (TaqMan MGB probe, 5′-FAM [6-carboxyfluorescein]-
labeled reporter dye, non-fluorescent quencher). The amounts of mouse chromosomal DNA 
in extracted samples were quantified in parallel qPCR reactions using a GADPH 
(glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) TaqMan assay as described for mouse VL 
model above. Each qPCR mixture (10 μl) included 5 μl of TaqMan Gene Expression master 
mix (Life Technologies), 0.5 μl of a 20x primer/probe mix (Life Technologies), and 4.5 μl 
(50 ng) of total DNA extracted from blood samples. PCRs were run on the Applied 
Biosystems 7900HT instrument. T. cruzi parasitemia was expressed as the abundance of T. 
cruzi microsatellite DNA relative to the abundance of mouse GAPDH DNA.
Mouse model of stage II HAT
Female CD1 (Charles River UK; ~8 weeks old; protocol number PPL 60/4442) mice were 
infected by injection into the peritoneum with 3 × 104 T. brucei (GVR35-VSL2) 
bloodstream form parasites46. Starting on day 21, mice were dosed by oral gavage once-
daily with GNF6702 (n= 6) at 100 mg/kg for 7 days or a single dose of diminazene aceturate 
(Sigma-Aldrich) at 40 mg/kg in sterile water was administered by ip injection (n= 3). A 
group of untreated mice (n= 3) was included as controls.
Mice were monitored weekly for parasitemia from day 21 post-infection. T. brucei was 
quantified in blood samples from the tail vein by microscopy, and in vivo bioluminescence 
imaging of infected mice was performed before treatment on day 21 post-infection and in 
weeks following the treatment (day 28, 35, 42, 56, 63, 72, 84, 92 post-infection). Imaging on 
groups of three mice was performed 10 min after ip injection of 150 mg D-luciferin 
(Promega)/kg body weight (in PBS) using an IVIS Spectrum (PerkinElmer) as described 
previously25. A group of uninfected mice (aged-matched for day 0 time point; n= 4) were 
imaged using the same acquisition settings to show the background bioluminescence (Fig. 
2e, grey-filled squares) in the absence of luciferase-expressing T. brucei after day 92 of the 
experiment. Untreated and diminazene-treated mice were euthanized on days 32 and 35, and 
day 42, respectively, due to high parasitemia or the development of symptoms related to 
CNS infection. GNF6702-treated mice were euthanized on day 92. No parasitemia or 
clinical symptoms were observed at this point. At the specified endpoints mice were

 sacrificed by cervical dislocation, after which whole brains were removed and imaged ex 
vivo within 10 minutes after administration of 100 μL of D-luciferin onto the brain surface. 
Data analysis for bioluminescence imaging was performed using Living Image Software. 
The same rectangular region of interest (ROI) covering the mouse body was used for each 
whole body image to show the bioluminescence in total flux (photons per second) within 
that region. Image panels of whole mouse bodies are composites of the original images with 
areas outside the ROI cropped out to save space. For ex vivo brain images the same oval 
shaped ROI was used to display the bioluminescence detected for each mouse brain at the 
respective endpoints.

 Figure 2. GNF6702 clears parasites in mouse models of kinetoplastid infections
a, Post-treatment L. donovani liver burdens in mouse model of VL as assessed by qPCR 
(n=5 mice). b, PK/PD relationship for ten GNF6702 analogues, each administered at several 
doses; circles: mean liver burdens associated with individual compound regimens (30 
regimens in total; n=5 mice per regimen) relative to vehicle; horizontal dotted line: 90% 
reduction in the liver L. donovani burden; vertical dotted line: 0.94-fold multiple of the mean 
free compound plasma concentration/the L. donovani EC90 value ratio. c, Post-treatment L. 
major footpad burdens in the BALB/c mouse model of CL as assessed by qPCR (n= 6 mice); 
the p values (two-tailed distribution) relate parasite burdens in compound-treated mice with 
those from vehicle-treated mice; left inset picture: a representative mouse footpad after 
treatment with vehicle; right inset picture: a representative mouse footpad after treatment 
with GNF6702 10 mg/kg twice-daily regimen. d, T. cruzi burden in mouse blood (circles), 
colon (triangles) and heart (diamonds) as assessed by qPCR after 20 days of treatment and 
four weeks of immunosuppression (n=8 mice). e, Whole body in vivo imaging of 
bioluminescent T. brucei before and after treatment; Trypanosoma brucei–infected mice 
were treated by a single intraperitoneal injection of diminazene aceturate (n=3 mice) or by 
oral administration of GNF6702 once-daily for 7 days (n=6 mice); filled symbols show 
whole body bioluminescence values for individual mice; several mice from the untreated and 
diminazene aceturate-treated groups were euthanized between days 28 and 56 due to CNS 
infection symptoms; background bioluminescence values shown for uninfected mice (grey-
filled squares; n=4) were collected independently from mice aged-matched for day 0 using 
the same acquisition settings. Red dotted lines in a, c and d plots show limit of parasite 
detection by qPCR; plot symbols below the red dotted line: mice with no detectable 
parasites; data points below the limit of detection are ‘jittered’ to show number of animals in 
a group; thick horizontal lines: means of the treatment groups; RU: relative units (parasite 
burden relative to the mean burden of the vehicle-treated group).

 Figure 3. F24L mutation in proteasome beta 4 subunit confers selective resistance to GNF6702
a, growth inhibition of T. cruzi epimastigote strains ectopically expressing PSMB4WT or 
PSMB4F24L protein by GNF6702 and bortezomib; non-induced/induced: culture medium 
without/with tetracycline to modulate expression of tetracycline-inducible PSMB4 genes. b, 
growth inhibition of T. brucei bloodstream form trypomastigotes constitutively 
overexpressing PSMB4WT or PSMB4F24L protein by GNF6702 and bortezomib. EC50 
values for each strain/compound pair are listed inside a and b plot panels next to 
corresponding strain/compound symbol (defined in plot legends); means from n=3 technical 
replicates are shown; error bars represent s.e.m. values; for data points lacking error bars, 
s.e.m. values are smaller than circles representing means; due to limited aqueous solubility, 
the highest tested GNF6702 concentration was 10 μM. RU (relative units) in a and b 
corresponds to parasite growth relative to the DMSO control (%).

inhibiting parasite proteasome chymotrypsin-like activity
a, Inhibition of three proteolytic activities of purified wild type (PSMB4WT) and 
PSMB4I29M T. cruzi proteasomes by GNF6702 and bortezomib; IC50 values for proteasome 
proteolytic activities are listed inside plots. b, Correlation between inhibition of 
chymotrypsin-like activity of purified L. donovani proteasome (IC50) and L. donovani 
axenic amastigote growth inhibition (EC50; data points correspond to means of 2 technical 
replicates); red circles: IC50>20 μM; blue circles: EC50>25 μM; yellow circles: IC50>20 μM 
and EC50>25 μM; data for 317 analogues are shown. c, Lineweaver-Burk plot of inhibition 
of T. cruzi proteasome chymotrypsin-like activity by GNF6702 at increasing concentrations 
of a peptide substrate. d, Effect of GNF6702 and bortezomib on three proteolytic activities 
of human constitutive proteasome; IC50 values for proteasome proteolytic activities are 
listed inside plots. Data shown in a, c and d represent means ± s.e.m. (n=3 technical 
replicates; for data points lacking error bars, s.e.m. values are smaller than circles 
representing means). Due to limited aqueous solubility, the highest tested GNF6702 
concentration in experiments shown in a and d was 10 μM.
