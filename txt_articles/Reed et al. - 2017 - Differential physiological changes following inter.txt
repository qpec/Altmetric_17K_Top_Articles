Abstract
Problematic internet use (PIU) has been suggested as in need of further research with a
view to being included as a disorder in future Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) of the
American Psychiatric Association, but lack of knowledge about the impact of internet cessa-
tion on physiological function remains a major gap in knowledge and a barrier to PIU classifi-
cation. One hundred and forty-four participants were assessed for physiological (blood
pressure and heart rate) and psychological (mood and state anxiety) function before and
after an internet session. Individuals also completed a psychometric examination relating to
their usage of the internet, as well as their levels of depression and trait anxiety. Individuals
who identified themselves as having PIU displayed increases in heart rate and systolic
blood pressure, as well as reduced mood and increased state of anxiety, following cessation
of internet session. There were no such changes in individuals with no self-reported PIU.
These changes were independent of levels of depression and trait anxiety. These changes
after cessation of internet use are similar to those seen in individuals who have ceased
using sedative or opiate drugs, and suggest PIU deserves further investigation and serious
consideration as a disorder.
Introduction
Problematic internet use (PIU) is a global issue [1], which is thought to be most pronounced
among younger individuals [2,3], but which is recognized as in need of further study in order
to define its precise nature [1,4–6]. PIU has been found to be associated with a range of psy-
chological problems, such as depression [7], anxiety [8,9], social isolation [10], and impulsivity
[11,12], and these associations have been well reviewed [13–15]. Those scoring highly on mea-
sures of PIU also report experiencing psychological withdrawal effects after cessation of con-
tact with the internet [16–18]. These withdrawal effects have been found to include increased
negative mood [17], depression [16], and anxiety [19]; in addition, cravings have also been
noted for those reporting internet video game addictions [20]. However, the impact of internet

 cessation is still poorly understood at the physiological level, and this represents a major gap in
knowledge.
Although it is not entirely clear how PIU should be classified in terms of a potential disor-
der, there is mileage in exploring putative physiological withdrawal effects in terms of known
impacts of cessation of addictive substances. In terms of substance addiction, physiological
measures (e.g., heart rate, blood pressure) are immediately affected by cessation of use of the
substance in question. The nature of the effect of cessation on the physiology of the individual
is dependent upon the substance. For example, cessation of alcohol [21], cannabis [22], and
opiate [23], use leads to an increase in such physiological measures in those who abuse these
substances. Whereas, cessation of usage of MDMA [24,25], nicotine [26], and stimulants [25],
depresses these physiological systems in individuals addicted to them. It is currently unknown
whether internet cessation would have any such effect on those who claim PIU, and, although
such physiological effects do not describe withdrawal effects in their entirety [18], without
such information the potential classification of PIU as a particular form of disorder is made
difficult [4–6].
Given this gap in current knowledge, the present study explored the impact of internet ces-
sation on the physiological functioning of those who reported higher- or lower-PIU. As with
the previous explorations of these issues for those impacted by addictive substances [21–23],
blood pressure and heart rate were used as the physiological measures; with state anxiety and
mood being the psychological variables measured, as these have been noted previously to be
impacted by internet cessation [16,17]. These variables were measured immediately prior to
and after an internet session, and changes in these variables were noted in order to assess the
impact of cessation of exposure to the internet [17,27]. To rule out the influence of psychologi-
cal variables that are often associated with PIU (i.e. depression [9] and trait anxiety [8]), and
which may impact physiological changes, these factors were also assessed for the participants,
and included in the analyses as covariates. If those who self-report higher levels of PIU display
psychological withdrawal effects akin to those seen previously, then there should be an increase
in state anxiety and changes in mood following cessation of the internet session [16–19,27].
Furthermore, if these individuals show physiological withdrawal effects akin to those seen for
individuals addicted to substances, there should also be changes in their physiological func-
tioning following cessation of the internet session. However, the nature of the physiological
changes produced by the cessation were not predicted, as it is currently unknown how (or if)
internet use functions in such a manner for those who self-report PIU.
Method
Ethical statement
Ethical approval for this research was obtained from the Department of Psychology Ethics
Committee, Swansea University. The participants provided informed consent to participate in
this study by signing a consent form following reading the information sheet provided for
them, and the Ethics Committee approved this consent procedure.
Participants
Previous examinations of the changes in psychological state as a result of internet exposure
have identified medium-sized effects [12,17,27], as have those investigating the physiological
impact of substance cessation [21–23]. Assuming such medium effect-sizes (d = .5) between
lower- and higher-PIU groups in the current study, for a power of .80, and adopting a signifi-
cance criterion of p < .05, then an N of 128 would be necessary to identify differences.

 One hundred and fifty-six volunteers were recruited from a student subject pool, and
received subject pool credit for their participation. A student sample was though appropriate
as younger individuals are thought to be more at risk from PIU [2,3]. Participants responded
to advertisements placed on the subject pool website. After they had volunteered, the partici-
pants were asked to report whether they had a history of psychiatric problems (depression,
anxiety, psychosis, neurodevelopmental or personality disorder) or addictions to substances or
to activities, such as gambling (on or offline). Twelve participants reported that they had such
a history, and their data were excluded from the study. It was hoped that this exclusion would
limit some potential comorbid problems influencing the results. This left 144 participants (81
females; 63 males) in the study, who had a mean age of 21.26 (SD ± 3.08; range = 18–33) years.
The participants’ self-reported ethnicity was: 57% White; 5% Mixed/Multiple Ethnic
Groups; 23% Asian; 16% Black/African/Caribbean; and 1% Other Ethnic Group. Of these par-
ticipants, 82% reported their nationality as British, but all participants were currently resident
in Great Britain. The marital status of the sample was: 88% single, 7% married or in a civil part-
nership; and 3% in other forms of relationship, and 2% divorced.
Participant’s typical use of the internet
Participants were asked to estimate the number of hours per week that they had spent on the
internet over the last two months; this measure is commonly taken in studies of problematic
internet use [12,28,29]. Although it has been suggested that ‘non-professional’ usage correlates
most strongly problems associated with heavy internet use [28], it was thought that the profes-
sional/non-professional distinction may not apply, or be discriminable, to all of the current
participants, and, as total internet use, in itself, also is associated with internet-related prob-
lems [28,30], this measure was employed.
The mean number of hours per day of internet use reported was 5.17 (± 4.14, range = 1 to 20):
38.2% reported spending under 3 hours/day online; 38.9% reported spending 3–6 hours/day
online; 9% reported spending 6–9 hours/day online; and 13.9% reported spending over 9 hours a
day on the internet. The mean number of hours per day spent online by females was 4.85 (± 3.81,
range = 1–20), and for males this was 5.57 (± 4.55, range = 1–20). An independent group t-test
revealed that this difference was not statistically significant, t(142) = 1.03, p > .30, d = .17.
The participants were also asked to indicate whether or not they had regularly visited par-
ticular types of internet site during the last two months. The percentage of the sample who
indicated that they had visited such sites was: Social Networking (e.g., Facebook, Twitter) =
91.6%; Shopping/Banking = 90.3%; Research = 84.0%; TV and film = 69.4%; News = 68.7%;
Dating and Sexual = 56.3%; Content Sharing (e.g., My Space, You Tube postings) = 45.1%;
Gambling (including lottery sites) = 34.7%; Gaming = 24.3%; Traditional Blogging (excluding
Twitter) = 20.1%; Chat rooms = 13.2%.
Materials
Internet addiction test (IAT [31]). The IAT is a 20-item scale covering the degree to
which use of internet disrupts everyday life. The overall score ranges from 20 to 100. The factor
structure of the IAT is currently debated [31,32], but a cut-off score of 40 or more for the total
IAT score has been taken as representing some level of problematic internet usage [17,32,33].
The internal reliability of the scale has been found to be between .90 and .93 [33], and this was
calculated as .92 for the current sample). The scale also has good concurrent validity with
other measures of disruptive internet use [29].
Positive and negative affect schedule (PANAS [34]). The PANAS is a 20-item question-
naire designed to measure participants’ positive and negative moods. The total scores can

 range from 10–50. The internal reliabilities of both the positive and negative scales have been
reported as above .90 [34], but these were calculated as .82 for the current sample. The scale
also correlates well with other measures of mood, such as the Hospital Anxiety and Depression
Scales [35].
Spielberger state-trait anxiety inventory (STAI [36]). The STAI rates the affective, cog-
nitive, and physiological manifestations of anxiety in terms of long-standing patterns (trait
anxiety) and current anxiety (state). The total score for each scale ranges from 20 to 80. The
internal reliability of the scales has been noted to be greater than .90 [36], but this was calcu-
lated as .84 for the state and .87 for the trait measure for the current sample). There is strong
evidence regarding its validity [36].
Beck’s depression inventory (BDI [37]). The BDI is a 21-item questionnaire that assesses
the clinical symptoms of depression through asking about feelings over the past week. The
score ranges from 0 to 63. The internal reliability of the scale is 0.93 [37] (this was calculated as
.94 for the current sample). Reviews have noted that the scale has excellent validity [38].
Physiological measures.
A heart rate monitor was placed on the index finger of the par-
ticipants’ non-dominant hand, which they wore for the duration of the study. Heart rate was
measured continuously throughout this period, and recorded on a PC. Blood pressure was
measured by an automatic electronic monitor.
Procedure
The participants initially experienced a 2-hour individual teaching session, unrelated to issues
concerned with the internet, which took place in the University. Participants were explicitly
told to switch off their mobile devices, and they had no access to a PC in the room. The 2-hour
period free of the internet prior to the study was chosen as it is similar in length to those peri-
ods chosen for studies of cessation of substance use [39], and it corresponded to the longest
period of individual teaching scheduled in the timetable (which was organizationally fortuitous
and would not make the session seem out of the ordinary for the students).
All subsequent testing was completed individually, in small experimental cubicles. Partici-
pants were told that this was an assessment of personality and physiology. They were connected
to the physiological equipment, and allowed 15min to acclimatize, while they completed the
BDI, STAI-state and trait, and PANAS, measures. During the 2min period, immediately prior to
their internet session, their blood pressure was taken twice (the second reading was employed),
and their heart rate was collected.
They then had a 15min period of internet exposure in which they could browse whatever
sites they wished. The period of exposure to the internet was short to be in line with previous
studies of the impact of internet use on psychological and behavioral function [12,17], but also
because current usage of the internet is largely through mobile devices, on which people spend
many but short sessions, rather than the previously longer sessions at a PC [19,27]. The num-
ber and nature of the websites visited was recorded for each participant. Participants were not
informed that this information would be collected, as this may have compromised their typical
usage of the internet during this session.
In the 2min period immediately following the internet session, blood pressure of the partic-
ipants was again taken and their heart rate was calculated. Participants then completed the
PANAS, STAI-state, and finally the IAT (which was presented after the rest of the experiment
was completed, so as not to influence the participants’ other responses as a consequence of see-
ing this questionnaire), as well as answering questions regarding their use of the internet (esti-
mating how many hours per day, and stating which sites they had typically used, over the past
two months).

 Results
The mean internet addiction (IAT) score for the sample was 40.04 (± 13.38; range = 10–73;
46.5% scoring above the cut-off for mild or worse, IAT = 4022,24). The mean IAT score for
males was 41.84 (± 14.36; range = 10–73; 49% scoring above cut-off); and the mean IAT for
females was 38.59 (± 12.48; range = 17–73; 42% scoring above cut-off). The difference in IAT
scores between the genders was not statistically significant, t(145) = 1.42, p = .149, d = .24.
There was a significant positive correlation between time spent online and the IAT score, r =
.188, p < .05.
Table 1 shows Pearson correlations between the various measures at baseline. Inspection of
these correlations shows that the relationships between the variables data were consistent with
previous explorations of these measures: PIU scores (measured by the IAT) was associated
with both trait and state anxiety, as well as with increased heart rate.
Participants were split into lower- and higher-level PIU groups at the cut-off for mild or
worse PIU. This produced a lower-PIU group (n = 77; mean = 29.95 ± 5.38; range = 10–39),
and a higher-PIU group (n = 67; mean = 51.58 ± 10.03; range = 40–73). The number of type of
websites visited during the 15min internet session by each participant was retrieved from their
browsing history. Five participants had deleted their browsing history, but the mean number
of websites visited during the 15min period by the remaining participants was 3.17 (± 1.62,
range 1–14): 2.95 (± 1.28, range 1–7) sites for lower-PIU scorers; and 3.12 (± 1.91, range 1–14)
sites for the higher-users. A t-test revealed no statistically significant difference between the
groups, t(137) = 1.72, p > .08, d = .28. The nature of the sites visited were categorised, and the
percentage of these sites were highly similar across the two PIU groups: Social Network = 40%
for lower-PIU scorers, and 43% for higher-PIU scorers; E-mail = 28% for lower-PIU scorers,
and 20% for higher-PIU scorers; Games = 15% for lower-PIU scorers, and 19% for higher-PIU
scorers; News and Sport = 10% for lower-PIU scorers, and 8% for higher-PIU scorers; Shop-
ping and Banking = 7% for lower-PIU scorers, and 10% for higher-PIU scorers. A chi-squared
test conducted on the numbers of site visited revealed no statistically significant difference
between the groups, chi-square < 1.
Fig 1 shows the change scores (after internet cessation minus before internet session) for
the lower- and higher-scoring PIU groups. The differences in the change scores between the
groups (lower- versus higher-PIU scorers) were analyzed for each variable using an analysis of
covariance, with depression and trait anxiety as covariates. There were significantly greater
changes (after applying a Bonferroni correction: .05/6 = .008) in the higher-PIU compared to
the lower-PIU group for: state anxiety, F(1,140) = 20.96, p < .001, η2

Discussion
These findings show that the impact from cessation of an internet session on higher-PIU scor-
ers is not restricted to psychological variables [16–19,27]. Higher-PIU scorers also show
greater increased systolic blood pressure and greater increased heart rate after cessation of an
internet session compared to lower-PIU scores. This finding of an impact from cessation of an
internet session on physiological indices of functioning is novel, and has some implications for
the manner in which such a potential internet-usage disorder is viewed. Although some physi-
ological measures previously have been found to correlate with IAT scores [40,41], this is the
first demonstration that termination of internet use produces a differential increase in such
measures for higher self-reported PIU scorers. The current data also corroborate findings
reported in previous studies of the psychological impact of cessation of internet sessions for

 those with higher self-reported PIU; that is, on cessation of internet usage, those with higher
self-reported PIU show a larger increase in state anxiety and negative mood than those with
lower-PIU scorers [16–19].
These cessation-of-internet effects in those with higher-PIU are similar to those noted after
termination of many depressant substances; such as alcohol [21], cannabis [22], and opiate-
based drugs [23]. In all of these cases, cessation of substance usage produces an increase in
many measures of physiological function [21–23]. In contrast, data from stimulant-type drugs
have often shown a decrease in these physiological signs; for example, nicotine [26], and
MDMA [24,25]. The pattern of results from the current study, thus, suggests that those with
higher-PIU scores may be experiencing withdrawal effects similar to those seen for such ‘seda-
tive’ substances. It should be remembered that there are alterations in physiological responses
associated with other types of psychiatric disorders than addictions; such as with anxiety-
related problems [42,43]. However, for these disorders, physiological changes tend to be noted
most pronouncedly during periods of exposure to the situations that provoke expression of the
disorder, rather than being manifest on termination of the exposure.
An implication of these findings is that, for the higher-PIU scorers in this sample, the inter-
net is possibly being used to relieve or escape stress and/or reduce anxiety [27], either pro-
duced by separation from the internet [19] or from pre-existing factors in an individual’s life
[8,9]. This view derived from the physiological data is supported by consideration of the effects
of internet cessation on the psychological states of the participants, in that removal of internet
connection for those with higher-PIU scores increased their state anxiety and negative mood.
Moreover, the psychological components of anxiety and stress have often been noted to be
associated with increases in systolic, but not in diastolic, blood pressure in a variety of situa-
tions [42,43], which is the pattern of data recorded in the current study with respect to the
internet. Further support for the above anxiety-escape interpretation of PIU is given by the
relationship between heightened trait anxiety and higher-PIU scores found in this, and previ-
ous [8,17], explorations of the area. Individuals displaying trait anxiety may well find reduction
in this state, through activities like internet use, serve to reinforce its usage [27]. There are, of
course, numerous alternative possibilities as to why any addiction (substance or behavioral) is
maintained at the level of the individual, including both positively and negatively reinforce-
ment, and there may well be variations in such maintaining factors in terms of PIU [44].
One further implication of such a pattern of use concerns its potential impact on the long-
term health of higher-PIU scorers [14,15,28,30]. The pattern of use of the internet in those
with PIU typically involves between 7–9 hours per day [19]; overall, the participants in the cur-
rent study used the internet for 5 hours per day, with higher usage in those with higher-PIU
scores. These observations seem to suggest that internet use has become a normative activity,
especially for younger individuals (which, of course, does not mean that it is risk-free). How-
ever, this high amount of use often tends to be distributed across numerous short visits [19,27]
(modeled by the relatively short 15min use in the current study) before cessation. The constant
separation, re-connection, and separation, and resultant psychological and physiological stress
that this may impart [16,19], may impact a range of physiological systems [30,40,41], increas-
ing risks of physical disease [28,30,42], as well as psychological distress [16–19]. For example,
the stress associated with internet addiction has already been demonstrated to impact the sym-
pathetic nervous system [40], and associated dopaminergic systems [41,42], which is poten-
tially associated with compromised immune function in higher-PIU scorers [30]. The current
results, especially those related to systolic blood pressure and heart rate [40,42], indicate that
cessation of an internet session for higher PIU scorers is such a stressful event [19,27].
It should be noted that there are a number of limitations to the generality of the conclusions
that might be reached on the basis of the present results. Firstly, the current sample was

 obtained from a western developed country, and results may be different in other cultures.
While there is no reason to assume that ethnicity per se has any impact on the factors produc-
ing addictions, the cultural role that the internet may play in particular societies may impact
on the maintenance of PIU. Secondly, these findings may be typical of those seen for general
internet users, but such results may not be seen with other populations who may use the inter-
net heavily for pursuits like gaming or pornography, both of which activities might be moti-
vated by increased levels of arousal [45,46]. The types of website visited during the 15min
internet session in the current study were broadly similar to the typical usage also claimed by
the participants, and are similar to those seen in the typical population [12,47]. This possibility
will require further exploration with specific samples. Thirdly, the exposure to the internet
was, of necessity, somewhat artificial in the current laboratory study. This nature of the experi-
ment was such that this could not be helped, although, as discussed above, the time period of
the internet session and the types of usage seen in this period were in line with those noted as
typical [19,47]. However, future studies might be conducted with the usage of portable physio-
logical measurement devices that might measure internet usage in situ. Fourthly, the degree of
PIU for the current sample was assessed by using the IAT. Scores on a single questionnaire
should not necessarily be equated to establishing the presence of a clinical problem, and the
participants identified as having ‘higher-problems’ in this study tended to have mild (but
greater) issues than those identified as having ‘lower-problems’–it is unclear whether these
relate to an addiction or actual functional impairment. Nevertheless, despite these caveats, the
current data are the first to show clear physiological impacts of internet cessation in a group of
higher PIU scorers, which suggests that PIU may have some similarities to ‘addiction-like’
problems.
The current data in relation to the proportion of individuals reporting higher levels of PIU
are in line with previous estimates of the numbers of individuals who report some degree of
PIU [12,17]. That there was little difference between the level of PIU in males and females is
also consistent with recent reports, which show this previously-noted gender difference to be
diminishing [17,27]. The correlations between the psychological variables and self-reported
PIU prior to the internet session use also shows that these data were consistent with previous
explorations of these measures: PIU scores (measured by the IAT) was associated with both
trait and state anxiety [16,17], as well as with increased heart rate [40]. It should be noted, how-
ever, that the current findings with regard to the physiological impacts of internet cessation
are independent of concomitant psychological factors, such as depression and trait anxiety,
and also of the nature and number of websites visited by the participants during their session.
In summary, these results give further importance to the notion that excessive internet use
for some individuals should be examined as a possible behavioral addiction, akin to gambling.
That those who self-report higher levels of PIU demonstrate increased heart rate and systolic
blood pressure on cessation of an internet session is suggestive of a ‘withdrawal-like’ effect,
which is similar to that seen for a range of sedative-type drugs. This finding adds to the grow-
ing literature that suggests that any such PIU-disorder may have some addiction-like proper-
ties, and should be regarded as a potentially serious global problem.
