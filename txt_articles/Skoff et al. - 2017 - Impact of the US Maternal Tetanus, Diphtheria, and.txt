Background. Infants aged <1 year are at highest risk for pertussis-related morbidity and mortality. In 2012, Tdap (tetanus toxoid, 
reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis) vaccine was recommended for women during each pregnancy to protect infants 
in the first months of life; data on effectiveness of this strategy are currently limited.
Methods. We conducted a case-control evaluation among pertussis cases <2 months old with cough onset between 1 January 
2011 and 31 December 2014 from 6 US Emerging Infection Program Network states. Controls were hospital-matched and selected 
by birth certificate. Mothers were interviewed to collect information on demographics, household characteristics, and healthcare 
providers. Provider-verified immunization history was obtained on mothers and infants. Mothers were considered vaccinated dur-
ing pregnancy if Tdap was received ≥14 days before delivery; trimester was calculated using Tdap date, infant’s date of birth, and 
gestational age. Odds ratios were calculated using multivariable conditional logistic regression; vaccine effectiveness (VE) was esti-
mated as (1 – odds ratio) × 100%.
Results. A total of 240 cases and 535 controls were included; 17 (7.1%) case mothers and 90 (16.8%) control mothers received 
Tdap during the third trimester of pregnancy. The multivariable VE estimate for Tdap administered during the third trimester of 
pregnancy was 77.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 48.3%–90.4%); VE increased to 90.5% (95% CI, 65.2%–97.4%) against hospi-
talized cases.
Conclusions. Vaccination during pregnancy is an effective way to protect infants during the early months of life. With a contin-
uing resurgence in pertussis, efforts should focus on maximizing Tdap uptake among pregnant women.

Despite the dramatic impact of vaccines on the burden of 
Bordetella pertussis in the United States, pertussis remains 
endemic, and reported cases have increased steadily since the 
late 1980s. In 2012, >48 000 pertussis cases were reported in the 
United States, the largest number since the mid-1950s. While 
causes for the increase are likely multifactorial, waning immu-
nity from acellular pertussis vaccination has been documented 
to be a strong contributor [1].
Infants are at greatest risk for pertussis-related complica-
tions and mortality, especially during the first months of life 
[1]. Immunization against pertussis with the 5-dose childhood 
DTaP (diphtheria toxoid, tetanus toxoid, and acellular pertussis) 
vaccine series begins at 2 months of age, leaving young infants 
highly susceptible to pertussis. Among case patients <2 months 
old, approximately 75% are hospitalized and 1 in 100 die [2]. 
Studies suggest that parents and siblings play an important role 
in transmitting pertussis to vulnerable infants [3, 4].
In 2005, 2 tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acel-
lular pertussis (Tdap) vaccines were licensed for use as a single 
booster dose among US adolescents and adults [5, 6]. Although 
the primary goal of Tdap immunization was to provide dir-
ect protection to the vaccine recipient, recommendations also 
focused on indirectly protecting infants through vaccination of 
close contacts, a strategy known as “cocooning” [5, 6]. In 2011, the 
Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recom-
mended vaccinating women with Tdap during a single pregnancy 
as a strategy to protect young infants through the transplacental 
transfer of maternal antibodies [7]. Because maternal antibodies 
are short-lived and may not be sufficient to protect infants of sub-
sequent pregnancies, the recommendation was expanded in 2012 
to include a dose of Tdap during every pregnancy [8, 9]. Because 
the recommendation for vaccination during pregnancy was made 
with limited data, postimplementation evaluations are essential for 
monitoring effectiveness and longer-term success of the strategy.

We conducted a multistate, case-control evaluation to deter-
mine the effectiveness of maternal Tdap vaccination during 
pregnancy at preventing pertussis in US infants <2 months old.
METHODS
A case of pertussis was defined as the onset of cough illness and 
at least 1 of the following: laboratory confirmation (culture or 
polymerase chain reaction) of pertussis, epidemiological linkage 
to a laboratory-confirmed case, or clinically compatible illness 
(cough ≥2 weeks with paroxysms, inspiratory whoop, or post-
tussive vomiting) in an infant <2 months old between 1 January 
2011 and 31 December 2014. Cases were identified through 
surveillance in 6 Emerging Infection Program Network sites 
[10]. The Emerging Infections Program Network is a collab-
orative network between the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention and state and local health departments, academic 
institutions, and laboratories that serves as a national resource 
for surveillance, prevention, and control of emerging infectious 
diseases. This case-control evaluation was conducted statewide 
in California, Connecticut, Minnesota, and New Mexico, and 
in select counties of New York (Albany, Allegany, Cattaraugus, 
Chautauqua, 
Chemung, 
Clinton, 
Columbia, 
Delaware, 
Erie, Essex, Franklin, Fulton, Genesee, Greene, Hamilton, 
Livingstone, Montgomery, Monroe, Niagara, Ontario, Orleans, 
Otsego, Rensselaer, Saratoga, Schenectady, Schoharie, Schuyler, 
Seneca, Steuben, Warren, Washington, Wayne, Wyoming, and 
Yates) and Oregon (Clackamas, Multnomah, and Washington). 
Infants were eligible for enrollment if they were at least 2 days 
old and resided in the catchment area on their cough onset 
date, were born in a hospital in their state of residence, were 
≥37 weeks’ gestational age at birth, were not adopted or in fos-
ter care, and did not live in a residential care facility. For each 
enrolled case infant, we attempted to recruit 3 control infants 
from birth certificates of infants born at the same hospital as the 
case infant that were <2 months old on the case infant’s cough 
onset date; once all potential controls meeting these criteria 
were exhausted, control enrollment ended for that case infant. 
Eligibility criteria were the same for control infants as for case 
infants, and control infants were additionally considered ineli-
gible if they had a pertussis diagnosis prior to the cough onset 
date of the corresponding case infant.
Mothers of case and control infants were interviewed by tele-
phone to collect information on demographics, mother and 
infant healthcare providers, and infant household contacts. The 
reference period for a case infant and his or her matched controls 
was defined as the 30-day period prior to the case infant cough 
onset date. Data used in the comparison of enrolled and unen-
rolled infants with pertussis were obtained from surveillance case 
report forms, maternal interviews, and birth certificate records; 
surveillance case report form data, which included hospitaliza-
tion status, were collected via patient and physician interview.
Pertussis vaccination status, including brand, manufacturer, 
and lot number, was collected through medical providers or 
state immunization registries for all enrolled case and control 
infants and their mothers. When complete vaccine history was 
unavailable in registries, all medical providers identified during 
the interview were contacted. Additionally, birth hospitals were 
contacted to obtain case and control maternal Tdap histories. 
Tdap doses were considered valid if received at least 2 weeks 
before the case infant’s cough onset date; for control infants, 
the date of cough onset for the matched case infant was used. 
Maternal vaccine history was considered complete when fol-
low-up was exhausted with all providers; if there was incom-
plete follow-up with providers but at least 1 valid Tdap dose 
was identified, these individuals were included in the analysis. 
Mothers were considered unvaccinated if all medical providers 
were contacted and did not provide documentation of Tdap 
vaccination and no Tdap records were identified in the immu-
nization registry. When >1 Tdap dose was verified, the most 
recent valid dose was included in the analysis. Mothers were 
classified as vaccinated before pregnancy if Tdap was received 
at any point prior to pregnancy with the case or control infant, 
vaccinated during pregnancy if they received Tdap ≥14 days 
before delivery, and vaccinated postpartum if Tdap was received 
<2 months following the case or control infant’s birth or in the 
14 days before delivery; the trimester during which Tdap was 
administered was calculated from the vaccination date, infant’s 
date of birth, and infant’s gestational age at birth. When avail-
able, lot numbers were verified with vaccine manufacturers 
to confirm vaccine type and brand. An infant was considered 
enrolled when the maternal interview, and infant and maternal 
vaccine history were all completed.
Data were analyzed using SAS version 9.3 software. Odds 
ratios were calculated using multivariable conditional logistic 
regression; vaccine effectiveness (VE) was estimated as (1 – 
odds ratio) × 100%. Variables associated (P < .05) with mater-
nal Tdap vaccination in bivariate analyses were included in the 
multivariable models; those that retained significance in multi-
variable analysis after backwards elimination were included in 
the final model. Although not significant, we retained infant age 
(weeks) in the final models, because cases and controls were not 
matched on age. Case and control mothers classified as unvac-
cinated were used as the reference group. Differences between 
proportions were tested using Pearson χ2 test or Fisher’s exact 
test; differences in medians were assessed using the Wilcoxon 
rank-sum test.
RESULTS
A total of 788 infants <2 months old with pertussis were identi-
fied; of these, 29 (3.7%) were born prematurely, 6 (0.76%) were 
adopted or resided in foster care, 5 (0.63%) were born at a hospi-
tal outside their state of residence, and 3 (0.38%) were not born

in a hospital. Of 745 infants eligible for enrollment, 251 (33.7%) 
were enrolled. The remaining 494 (66.3%) were not enrolled for 
the following reasons: 354 (71.7%) had mothers that could not 
be reached, 100 (20.2%) did not consent, 31 (6.3%) had incom-
plete maternal vaccination history follow-up, 7 (1.4%) did not 
speak English or Spanish, and 2 (0.4%) had another reason for 
nonenrollment. Compared with unenrolled infants with pertus-
sis, mothers of enrolled infants were significantly more likely 
to have post–high school education; no significant differences 
were observed for sex, race, ethnicity, hospitalization, outcome, 
or insurance type (Table 1).
We identified 5507 infants eligible to be enrolled as con-
trols, 682 (12.4%) of whom were enrolled in the evaluation. 
The remaining 4825 were not enrolled for the following rea-
sons: 4124 (85.5%) had mothers that could not be reached, 623 
(12.9%) did not consent, 53 (1.1%) had incomplete maternal 
vaccination history follow-up, 6 (0.1%) resided outside of the 
catchment area on corresponding case infant cough onset date, 
4 (0.1%) did not speak English or Spanish, and 15 (0.3%) had 
another reason for nonenrollment. Demographics of enrolled 
case and control infants are shown in Table 2. Because there 
was a disproportionate number of enrolled control infants 
compared to enrolled case infants among those <2 weeks old, 
we restricted our analysis to case infants who were ≥2 weeks 
old on their cough onset date and control infants who were ≥2 
weeks old on their corresponding case infant’s cough onset date 
(Table 2); 11 (4.4%) case infants and 147 (21.6%) control infants 
were excluded. The population for analysis included 240 case 
infants and 535 control infants.
Overall, 136 (56.7%) case mothers and 358 (66.9%) control 
mothers had at least 1 valid Tdap dose identified. Eighteen of 
136 (13.2%) vaccinated case mothers and 50 of 358 (14.0%) 
vaccinated control mothers had >1 valid dose of Tdap reported 
(P = .83); 61 mothers had 2 documented doses of Tdap, and 7 
had 3. Among the 61 women with 2 Tdap doses, the median 
time between doses was 1022 days (range, 7–2744 days) and 
did not differ significantly between case and control mothers 
(P = .32).
Figure 1A–C shows the distribution of Tdap doses included 
in the final model and their timing of administration in rela-
tion to pregnancy. Of Tdap doses received during pregnancy 
(associated with 22 cases and 117 controls), approximately 77% 
were received during the third trimester, most during the ACIP-
recommended 27–36 weeks of gestation (Figure 1A). For the 24

case-associated and 67 control-associated doses received before 
pregnancy, 6 (25.0%) case mothers and 46 (68.7%) control 
mothers received Tdap ≤2 years before pregnancy (Figure 1B). 
For doses classified as postpartum, 75.9% of control-associated 
doses and 74.4% of case-associated doses were given within the 
first 2 days following birth; 5 (5.6%) doses among case mothers 
and 7 (4.0%) among control mothers were received during the 
last 2 weeks of pregnancy and therefore classified as postpartum 
(Figure 1C).
The overall effectiveness of vaccination at any time during the 
third trimester of pregnancy was 77.7% (95% confidence inter-
val [CI], 48.3%–90.4%; Table 3); the effectiveness of Tdap given 
during the first or second trimester was 64.3% (95% CI, –13.8% 
to 88.8%), but confidence bounds overlapped with those for the 
third trimester. When restricting third-trimester doses to the 
recommended window of 27–36 weeks, VE was 78.4% (95% CI, 
49.8%–90.7%). There was no effectiveness when a dose of Tdap 
was given to the mother during the postpartum period (4.9%; 
95% CI, –49.3% to 39.5%; Table 3).
Tdap given at any point before pregnancy was 50.8% (95% CI, 
2.1%–75.2%) effective at preventing infant pertussis (Table 3). 
We further stratified this analysis by examining Tdap doses given 
≤2 years before pregnancy and Tdap doses given >2 years before 
pregnancy; the effectiveness of Tdap given >2 years before preg-
nancy was –25.6% (95% CI, –207.4% to 48.7%) and the effect-
iveness of Tdap given ≤2 years before pregnancy was 83.0% (95% 
CI, 49.6%–94.3%). The point estimate for Tdap given ≤2 years 
before pregnancy was not significantly different than the point 
estimate for Tdap given during the third trimester (P = .6034).

 Maternal Tdap Vaccine Effectiveness • CID 2017:65 (15 December) • 1981
Approximately 65.4% (157/240) of case-infants were hospi-
talized during the course of their pertussis infection. When we 
examined the effectiveness of Tdap at preventing infant per-
tussis hospitalizations, the VE point estimate for vaccination 
during the third trimester increased to 90.5% (95% CI, 65.2%–
97.4%). An increase in VE point estimates was also observed 
for doses given at any point before pregnancy, during the first 
or second trimester, and postpartum; however, the postpartum 
estimate remained nonsignificant (Table 4).
A total of 43 of 136 (31.6%) vaccinated case mothers and 102 
of 358 (28.5%) vaccinated control mothers received Boostrix, 
and 76 of 136 (55.9%) vaccinated case mothers and 207 of 358 
(57.8%) vaccinated control mothers received Adacel; brand 
information was not available for the remaining 17 of 136 
(12.5%) case mothers and 49 of 358 (13.7%) control mothers 
who had record of Tdap receipt. When we calculated the effect-
iveness of either vaccine product at preventing infant disease 
when administered during the third trimester, point estimates 
were not statistically different from one another (P = .85).
DISCUSSION
Our findings, using data from multiple US states, add to the 
growing body of evidence that vaccination during pregnancy 
is effective, underscoring its importance as a key strategy for 
preventing pertussis in young infants. The United Kingdom was 
first to evaluate Tdap vaccination during pregnancy, demon-
strating high effectiveness at preventing pertussis during the 
first 2 months of life [11, 12]. Vaccination during pregnancy 
was recommended in the United Kingdom in late 2012 owing to 
a sudden increase in pertussis morbidity and mortality among 
infants, and high Tdap coverage (60%) was rapidly achieved 
among pregnant women [11]. Three years postintroduction, 
high effectiveness has been sustained [13]. Contrary to the UK 
experience, US uptake of the recommendation has progressed 
at a much slower pace. A recent survey reports that 48.8% of US 
pregnant women received Tdap during the 2015–2016 influenza 
season, an increase of 21.8% from the 2013–2014 season [14]. 
Although coverage continues to increase, there is likely consid-
erable variation in vaccine uptake across the United States and 
among medical providers caring for pregnant women. Emphasis 
should be placed on maximizing Tdap uptake during pregnancy 
in order to optimize the benefits of the strategy.
Although our results are consistent with those from a US 
cohort analysis, we found slightly lower effectiveness of vacci-
nation during pregnancy than in the United Kingdom, where 
estimates were obtained using similar case-control methodol-
ogy; a second, more recent US cohort study also found higher 
point estimates of VE, but the confidence intervals were wide 
and included our estimated effectiveness [11, 15, 16]. Ninety 
percent of infants <1 year old with pertussis reported in the 
United Kingdom between 2002 and 2009 were hospitalized 
[17]. In contrast, US data indicate that 34%–69% of infants with 
pertussis are hospitalized [3, 6, 18, 19], with the proportion 
of hospitalizations decreasing in recent years [2]. While there 
could be real differences in the epidemiology of severe disease 
or the threshold for hospitalization of suspected infant cases, 
this disparity more likely reflects differences in case ascertain-
ment practices and the ability of US surveillance to capture 
more outpatient illness [10]. Interestingly, when our models 
were restricted to hospitalized cases, higher vaccine effective-
ness was observed, closely mirroring the UK estimates. In the 
UK study, all cases were laboratory-confirmed, which could 
also lead to a higher VE estimate; however, the majority of our 
cases were also laboratory-confirmed (94%), suggesting that 
this does not account for our lower estimate.
Sixty-eight percent of our cases were from California 
(Table 1), which has experienced large pertussis epidemics in 
recent years, with a proportion of cases in Hispanic infants that 
is greater than the proportion of Hispanics in the California 
birth cohort [20]. As a result, 62% of our enrolled cases were 
Hispanic (Table 1), which is higher than US national estimates 
(49% of pertussis cases aged <2 months with known ethnicity, 
US National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System, 2011–
2014, unpublished data). While an increased risk of pertussis in 
Hispanic infants has been reported, additional study is needed 
to fully understand why Hispanic infants are at increased risk 
[21]. It is reassuring that vaccination during pregnancy is highly 
effective in a population with a high proportion of Hispanic 
cases, further underscoring the importance of this strategy.
The recommendation for cocooning has been in place since 
the US introduction of Tdap; however, programmatic imple-
mentation of the strategy has encountered substantial logis-
tical challenges resulting in poor Tdap uptake and incomplete 
coverage among infant close contacts [22, 23]. Consistent with 
published evaluations of the cocooning strategy, point estimates 
from our analysis, although not reaching significance, show no 
benefit of a dose of Tdap administered to the mother postpar-
tum [16, 24, 25]. Recent data from non-human primates have 
suggested that acellular vaccination, unlike vaccination with

whole-cell pertussis vaccine, may not preclude B. pertussis col-
onization and further transmission of the organism [26]. In an 
era of exclusively acellular vaccine use in the United States, vac-
cinated individuals could remain a significant source of pertussis 
transmission to young infants, highlighting additional short-
comings of cocooning and further underscoring the critical role 
of effective strategies such as vaccination during pregnancy.
Recent studies have brought into question the ideal timing of 
Tdap administration during pregnancy, providing evidence that 
vaccination during the second or early third trimester may max-
imize transplacental transfer of maternal pertussis antibodies to 
the infant [27–29]. While active transport of maternal antibod-
ies is thought to be minimal before 30 weeks’ gestation, vaccina-
tion too late in pregnancy could diminish protection provided 
to the infant [30]. Because most Tdap-vaccinated mothers in 
our evaluation received vaccine during the recommended third 
trimester, our sample size was not adequate to detect a signifi-
cant difference in VE between third-trimester doses and doses 
administered earlier in pregnancy, and small numbers left us 
unable to evaluate narrower time periods. Our analysis did find 
benefit of a dose of Tdap given in the 2 years prior to pregnancy, 
with a VE point estimate not significantly different than that of 
a dose administered during the third trimester. While we were 
not powered to detect a significant difference between point 
estimates, this finding is consistent with other VE studies that 
have shown benefit of Tdap prior to pregnancy [16, 31]. Future 
studies should not only continue to evaluate the infant immune 
response to Tdap doses administered prior to the third trimes-
ter of pregnancy, but also assess how transferred antibody cor-
relates with protection against clinical disease.
Although Tdap vaccination during pregnancy is effective 
at preventing infant pertussis, important questions remain. 
Reduced Tdap effectiveness has been documented among ado-
lescents primed with acellular pertussis vaccines compared to 
cohorts vaccinated with whole-cell vaccine [32–34]. Whether 
the effectiveness of vaccination during or in the 2 years prior to 
pregnancy will diminish as the number of aP-primed pregnant 
women increases is yet to be determined; the exact timing of Tdap 
administration could become more critical among aP-vaccinated 
mothers if antibodies diminish more rapidly in these women. 
Maternal immunization during pregnancy also has the poten-
tial to blunt an infant’s immune response to the DTaP childhood 
series. While circulating maternal antibodies decline rapidly and 
potential interference is expected to be short-lived, studies have 
generated conflicting evidence on blunting, and its clinical rele-
vance is still largely unknown [35–40]. Continued monitoring of 
the epidemiology of pertussis will be important to detect poten-
tial shifts in the age distribution of childhood disease.
Maximizing the protection of young infants remains a high 
priority, especially in the setting of increased pertussis activity. 
Efforts should focus on the promotion of maternal immuniza-
tion through provider and patient education to increase Tdap 
uptake among pregnant women (www.cdc.gov/pertussis/preg-
nant). Pertussis vaccines with improved duration of immunity 
are needed, but new vaccines remain on the distant horizon. 
While maternal immunization during pregnancy will help 
bridge the gap until next-generation pertussis vaccines are 
licensed and available for use, this highly effective strategy will 
likely remain an integral component of pertussis prevention 
and control, even in the setting of new vaccines.
