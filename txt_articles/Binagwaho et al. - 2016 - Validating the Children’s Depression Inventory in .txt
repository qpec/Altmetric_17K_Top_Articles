Abstract
Background: Depression is often co-morbid with chronic conditions, and when combined with HIV it can increase
progression and reduce survival. A brief and accurate screening tool for depression among children living with HIV
is necessary to increase access to mental health care and improve HIV-related outcomes in the long-term.
Methods: A validation study was conducted, comparing the Children’s Depression Inventory (CDI) with a structured
clinical assessment as the gold standard among children living with HIV ages 7-14 years in Rwanda. The response
rate was 87 % and the analysis was performed among 100 study participants.
Results: Twenty-five percent of children had a diagnosis of depression based on the clinical interview. Sensitivity of
the CDI ranged from 44 to 76 % and specificity was 92 to 100 % for cut-off scores from 5 to 9. The area under the
curve (AUC) for receiver operating characteristic analysis, an estimate of overall accuracy, was 0.87 (95 % confidence
interval: 0.77 – 0.97).
Conclusions: The significant prevalence of depression among children living with HIV in Rwanda reflects a critical need
to advance mental health care in this population. Although overall accuracy of the CDI is reasonable in this context,
further research needs to be done to develop a more sensitive measure of depression in this vulnerable population.
Development of a highly sensitive screening measure will be a fundamental step towards improving access to mental
health care among children living with HIV, potentially improving health outcomes and quality of life in the long-term as
this vulnerable population transitions into adulthood.

Background
Depression has been shown to have a significant burden
on people living with HIV (PLH) and can result in an in-
creased risk of opportunistic infection and mortality [1, 2].
In Rwanda, antiretroviral medications (ARVs) are available
throughout the country and increased survival has re-
sulted in HIV becoming a chronic illness in this context.
However, with chronic conditions there is an increased
risk of depression [3, 4]. With respect to HIV, depression
has been associated with reduced adherence to ARVs
[5, 6] and poor quality of life [7–9]. Among children
living with HIV, depression has also been documented
as being co-morbid [10, 11], similar to other chronic
diseases that require life-long treatment. While priori-
tizing the mental health needs of children living with
HIV is vital to national health programs, thus far, the
mental health care in this high risk population has been
neglected, particularly in settings or populations with
limited resources [12].
In Rwanda, the mental health needs of children are
likely to be greater given the country’s history of trauma
and economic insecurity [13, 14]. It has been shown that
when a community experiences widespread trauma which
greatly affects the social and cultural fabric, children of
the following generations often continue to display symp-
toms of psychological trauma [15]. Depression among
children has been documented in Rwanda [16] and mental

 health care should be a high priority, in part due to the
economic hardships and the legacy of genocide that has
placed their parents or caregivers at high risk of depres-
sion [17]. The history of trauma may also exacerbate the
impact of HIV on children in Rwanda, where there is an
estimated 22,000 children living with HIV under 15 years
of age [18]. HIV-related stigma has also been observed to
significantly increase the risk of depressive symptoms
among youth in this context. [14] For these reasons, it is
critical to identify children suffering from depression to
increase access to treatment and quality of care in this vul-
nerable population.
Despite this critical need for care, there is currently no
screening instrument for depression that has been vali-
dated among children living with HIV in Rwanda. Given
the comorbidity of depression and HIV, an integrated
treatment approach may increase access to mental
health care and improve HIV-related outcomes [19]. An
initial step towards linking mental health and HIV care
among children would be the availability of a valid
screening tool for depression to identify those with ele-
vated symptoms that would benefit from treatment. This
would advance access to care for depression in a system
that has demonstrated increasing capacity to offer
decentralized services through a network of district hos-
pitals and community health centers. In addition, care
for depression among children living with HIV would
also be available through Rwanda’s progressive national
health system that provides subsidized insurance for
many below the poverty level. In light of the burden of
depression in this at risk population and the potential
for increasing access to services, the primary aim of this
study is to examine the validity of a commonly used
measure of depression, the Children’s Depression Inven-
tory (CDI), among a group of children suffering from
HIV receiving antiretroviral treatment in Rwanda.
Methods
Study design and sampling
A validation study was implemented in Rwanda from
December 2011 to April 2012, comparing the CDI with
depression as determined by professional psychologists
trained in the use of a structured instrument based on
the criteria for major depressive disorder in the DSM-IV
[20] and ICD-10 [21]. Study participants were Rwandan
children living with HIV, 7-14 years of age, who were
aware of their HIV status and receiving antiretroviral
treatment (ART) for at least 6 months.
All study participants were previously enrolled in a lar-
ger study of children living with HIV attending school
that examined the effect of schooling and social support
groups on treatment adherence [22]. For this broader
study, a stratified random sample of 150 children living
with HIV was drawn from ten health care facilities, two
within each of the five Rwandan provinces. A list of eli-
gible children was created for each of the ten facilities
and numbers were assigned to each child on the list. A
random number generator was then used in Microsoft
Excel to randomly select 15 children from each facility.
For the smaller depression validation study we randomly
selected one hundred children from this larger group of
150 also using a random number generator. The re-
sponse rate for completing the study questionnaires was
87 %. Given the small sample size, 13 additional children
were randomly selected among the remaining 50 en-
rolled in the larger study to achieve the targeted sample
size of 100 for the validation study.
Measures and assessment
The Short-Form of the Children’s Depression Inventory
(CDI) was selected as the tool to be validated in Rwanda
given its simplicity and brevity of administration. The
Short-Form of the CDI is a ten-item screening instrument
with scores ranging from 0 – 20 that can be used by health
workers at all levels of training and in clinical as well as
non-clinical settings to identify children with elevated de-
pressive symptoms comparable with major depression [23].
The CDI has demonstrated validity and/or reliability in a
range of settings including Spain, Greece, and Germany,
among other countries, with the cut-off scores varying for
different countries [24]. The CDI was considered over
other measures of depressive symptoms given its wide-
spread use; it has been the most commonly used instru-
ment to assess depression in trials among children since
1984 [24]. For the current study, The CDI was translated
by a team of bilingual (English and Kinyarwanda) clinical
psychologists experienced in pediatric care. The question-
naire was back-translated by a similarly qualified (but
different) team. Any discrepancies were resolved at a
joint meeting of these two groups, chaired by the first
author of the manuscript (Dr. Agnes Binagwaho). For
children, the questionnaire was piloted by clinical psy-
chologists to ensure comprehensibility and appropriate
improvements were made.
A structured clinical assessment was used as the gold
standard to evaluate the validity of the CDI and identify
appropriate cut-off scores for children in Rwanda. The in-
strument was a checklist based on the criteria for major
depression in the DSM-IV [20] and the ICD-10 [21]. The
clinical assessments were performed after the CDI by ex-
perienced psychologists from the National Psychosocial
Center who had prior experience in pediatric mental
health. If the child was diagnosed with major depression,
follow-up treatment was provided by a clinical psycholo-
gist or psychiatrist at the referral hospital if needed. In-
formed consent was obtained through written informed
consent with a parent or guardian of the child. In addition,
child assent was obtained verbally. The Ethics Committee

 of the National University of Rwanda, which is recognized
by the Rwandan National Ethics Committee, provided eth-
ical approval.
Statistical analysis
Descriptive statistics were calculated for sociodemo-
graphic characteristics of study participants, including fre-
quencies for urban/rural residence, province, sex, age,
education, and orphan status. Univariate analyses were
conducted examining the associations between these fac-
tors and major depression. Sensitivity, specificity, positive
predictive value, and negative predictive value estimates
were calculated at varying cut-off scores for the CDI, using
the structured clinical interview by the psychologists as
the gold standard. Cut-off scores for the analysis ranged
from 5 to 9, given that a specificity less than 0.90 would
not offer much utility in this context. Receiver Operating
Characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to evaluate
the overall validity of the CDI as compared to clinical as-
sessment in the Rwandan context.
Results and Discussion
Results
Table 1 presents the sociodemographic characteristics of
study participants. Fifty-seven percent of the participants
were female and 93 % were currently enrolled in primary
school. Thirty-three percent of the participants were from
urban settings and 20 % were from each of the five prov-
inces, in correspondence with the sampling strategy for
the study. Table 2 summarizes the distribution of sociode-
mographic characteristics by children who were depressed
versus not depressed according to the structured clinical
interview. Based on this assessment, 25 % of the children
had a clinical diagnosis of depression. A statistically sig-
nificant finding was observed by province, whereby 75 %
of the children in the Western Province were depressed,
as compared to 5 % in Kigali City (p < 0.001). Other po-
tentially meaningful differences were observed between
groups, although they did not achieve statistical signifi-
cance. For example, a trend was observed whereby over
28 % of participants residing in rural areas were depressed
versus 18 % in urban areas (p = 0.331). Nearly 30 % of girls
were depressed versus 19 % for boys, although this finding
was not statistically significant (p = 0.247).
Table 3 provides estimates of sensitivity, specificity,
positive predictive value, and negative predictive value at
varying cut-off scores of the CDI using the clinical assess-
ment as the gold standard. The sensitivity ranged from 76
to 44 % for cut-off scores of 5 and 9, respectively. For spe-
cificity, estimates were from 92 to 100 % for the same cut-
off scores. Based on the ROC analysis, the area under
the curve (AUC) was 0.87 (95 % CI: 0.77 – 0.97), dem-
onstrating a fair degree of accuracy of the CDI as
compared to a structured diagnostic interview as the
gold standard (see Fig. 1).
Discussion
Children living with HIV are at risk of major depression
[10, 11], due in part to the social isolation and stigma that
often accompanies the disease as well as remaining uncer-
tainty about their future. In Rwanda, since ART is more
widely available for children living with HIV, the disease
has become a chronic condition. Depression is often co-
morbid with chronic illness [3, 4], and as HIV-related sur-
vival has improved substantially it is important to consider
strategies for identifying and treating major depression
among children living with HIV. Our findings demon-
strate the feasibility of administering a screening measure
for depressive symptoms among children receiving HIV
treatment in Rwanda. Based on ROC analysis, the overall
accuracy of the CDI was good (AUC = 0.87). A cut-off

 score of 5 demonstrated reasonable estimates of sensitivity
(76 %) and specificity (92 %).
Although the CDI has been used in several studies in
sub-Saharan Africa [25, 26], it has not yet been validated
in Rwanda. Given that the presentation of symptoms and
interpretation of severity may vary across cultures, it is
important to validate measures of psychological symptoms
in different contexts, to ensure that the measure is identi-
fying youth with elevated symptoms comparable with
major depression with a reasonable degree of accuracy
[27]. For example, studies of the CDI among adolescents
from China [28] and Puerto Rico [27] reflected the need
for different cut-off scores for a level of symptoms
comparable with major depression in different cultural
contexts.
Findings from this study indicated that sociodemo-
graphic factors such as urban/rural residence, sex, and edu-
cational level were not associated with depression in this
population. This may be due to limited sample size, given
that expected trends were observed for some variables [29,
30]. However, children receiving ART in the Western Prov-
ince were at the highest risk of depression. Consideration
of geographical variation in the burden of depression in
this population may be necessary in planning the roll out
of services that integrates depression screening activities
within the context of HIV care for children. Research is
currently underway to better understand why the level of
depression is higher in some of the geographic areas,
examining factors such as history (e.g., impact of genocide)
and other health risks (e.g., malnutrition). Poverty may also
play a role, since children receiving ART in rural areas
were at higher risk of depression (28 %) as compared
with those in urban settings (18 %), although this find-
ing was not statistically significant. Broader initiatives
in poverty reduction in Rwanda, a key priority for the
government through its Vision 2020 plan, may in the
long-term have an effect on the burden of depression
among children living with HIV.
The CDI demonstrated a higher specificity in this
population (92 %) compared to the sensitivity (76 %).
This is to ensure that false-positives are minimized
given limited resources for mental health care in
Rwanda. However, the lower sensitivity indicates that
over 20 % of true-positives will also be missed, which
should be a consideration for future studies. Inclusion
of locally derived depressive symptoms may increase
the sensitivity of a screening tool. Although a recent
validation study of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies
Depression Scale for Children (CES-DC) that included
symptoms developed locally was conducted with youth

 in Rwanda ages 10-17, this was performed among the
general population as opposed to children living with
HIV [16].
There are some important limitations to this study.
First, given its small sample size, it is not possible to de-
termine if the null findings noted above are due to a true
lack of association or to limited statistical power. A
greater number of study participants would improve our
power to detect an association between depression and
sociodemographic characteristics of interest. However,
since this study relied upon in-depth clinical evaluations,
it would not have been feasible to recruit a large number
of children in our study population. In addition, due to
the sample selection process among children living with
HIV receiving treatment, there was not an equal number
of depressed versus non-depressed participants. This
also limits the statistical power of our study. In addition,
since this validation study was conducted among chil-
dren living with HIV who also are actively receiving care,
the findings may not be generalizable to children who
may not be accessing treatment. Finally, locally relevant
symptoms of depression were not included in the symp-
tom scale. This may have potentially reduced the sensi-
tivity of identifying cases of major depression.
A screening tool with higher sensitivity would offer
greater utility among children living with HIV, given the
significant burden of depression in this population (25 %
prevalence). There is a need to develop Rwandan policy
to address routine screening for depression among chil-
dren living with HIV. Improving mental health services
for this segment of the population may result in im-
proved adherence and survival [1, 5]. Moreover, such ac-
tions are likely to improve quality of life [7] and
children’s hope for the future.
The potential for increased health benefits of treating
depression for children with other chronic conditions may
also be evident given the burden in those populations [3,
31–33]. Therefore, it is important to screen for depression
in children suffering from all chronic diseases, not only
HIV. By using a quick, easy-to-interpret depression
screening tool, this goal is achievable in Rwandan national
health policy. Moreover, such a goal is revolutionary, as
no African government has yet dedicated resources to
routine screening of children at risk for depression, nor
has a policy been put in place that will systematically pro-
vide treatment to those in need. This study is an import-
ant step in realizing such an objective.
Conclusions
This study demonstrated that depression is often co-
morbid with HIV among children in Rwanda, indicating
the need for integrating mental health care with HIV
treatment for youth in this context. In order to identify
children living with HIV at risk for depression, a brief and
accurate screening measure is needed for use at the point
at which care is delivered. Although the CDI reflected an
overall good degree of accuracy as well as reasonable sen-
sitivity and specificity, increasing the sensitivity of the
measure by adding locally derived symptoms may help
improve this screening instrument for depression among

 children living with HIV in Rwanda. Access to a highly
sensitive screening measure for depression will be a
fundamental step towards improving access to mental
health care among children living with HIV, potentially
improving HIV-related outcomes and quality of life in
the long-term as this vulnerable population transitions
into adulthood.
