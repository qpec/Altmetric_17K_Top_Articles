Abstract
IMPORTANCE—In the United States, regional variation in cardiovascular mortality is well-
known but county-level estimates for all major cardiovascular conditions have not been produced.
OBJECTIVE—To estimate age-standardized mortality rates from cardiovascular diseases by 
county.
DESIGN AND SETTING—Deidentified death records from the National Center for Health 
Statistics and population counts from the US Census Bureau, the National Center for Health 
Statistics, and the Human Mortality Database from 1980 through 2014 were used. Validated small 
area estimation models were used to estimate county-level mortality rates from all cardiovascular 
diseases, including ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic 
stroke, hypertensive heart disease, cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation and flutter, rheumatic heart 
disease, aortic aneurysm, peripheral arterial disease, endocarditis, and all other cardiovascular 
diseases combined.

 EXPOSURES—The 3110 counties of residence.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES—Age-standardized cardiovascular disease mortality 
rates by county, year, sex, and cause.
RESULTS—From 1980 to 2014, cardiovascular diseases were the leading cause of death in the 
United States, although the mortality rate declined from 507.4 deaths per 100 000 persons in 1980 
to 252.7 deaths per 100 000 persons in 2014, a relative decline of 50.2% (95% uncertainty interval 
[UI], 49.5%–50.8%). In 2014, cardiovascular diseases accounted for more than 846 000 deaths 
(95% UI, 827–865 thousand deaths) and 11.7 million years of life lost (95% UI, 11.6–11.9 million 
years of life lost). The gap in age-standardized cardiovascular disease mortality rates between 
counties at the 10th and 90th percentile declined 14.6% from 172.1 deaths per 100 000 persons in 
1980 to 147.0 deaths per 100 000 persons in 2014 (posterior probability of decline >99.9%). In 
2014, the ratio between counties at the 90th and 10th percentile was 2.0 for ischemic heart disease 
(119.1 vs 235.7 deaths per 100 000 persons) and 1.7 for cerebrovascular disease (40.3 vs 68.1 
deaths per 100 000 persons). For other cardiovascular disease causes, the ratio ranged from 1.4 
(aortic aneurysm: 3.5 vs 5.1 deaths per 100 000 persons) to 4.2 (hypertensive heart disease: 4.3 vs 
17.9 deaths per 100 000 persons). The largest concentration of counties with high cardiovascular 
disease mortality extended from southeastern Oklahoma along the Mississippi River Valley to 
eastern Kentucky. Several cardiovascular disease conditions were clustered substantially outside 
the South, including atrial fibrillation (Northwest), aortic aneurysm (Midwest), and endocarditis 
(Mountain West and Alaska). The lowest cardiovascular mortality rates were found in the counties 
surrounding San Francisco, California, central Colorado, northern Nebraska, central Minnesota, 
northeastern Virginia, and southern Florida.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE—Substantial differences exist between county ischemic 
heart disease and stroke mortality rates. Smaller differences exist for diseases of the myocardium, 
atrial fibrillation, aortic and peripheral arterial disease, rheumatic heart disease, and endocarditis.
Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death in the United State despite 
declines in the national cardiovascular disease mortality rate between 1980 and 2015.1 
Mortality rates for smaller regions of the country such as counties can differ substantially 
from the national average.2 County-level differences in mortality rates have important 
implications for local and national health policy.3
Death certificates remain an essential source of data for measuring long-term trends in 
public health.4 Prior examinations of county-level cardiovascular disease mortality have 
been limited to only heart disease or stroke and have not accounted for the way in which 
deaths are attributed to other important cardiovascular disease or intermediate and 
nonspecific causes.
To examine geographic variation in cardiovascular disease mortality rates, death records 
from 1980 through 2014 were used to produce consistent and comparable estimates of 
cardiovascular disease mortality for all US counties.

 Methods
This analysis used methods that are reported in detail elsewhere5 and described briefly 
herein. This research received institutional review board approval from the University of 
Washington (human subjects application 46665). Informed consent was not required because 
the study used deidentified data and was retrospective.
Data
This analysis used deidentified death records from the National Center for Health Statistics6 
and population counts from the US Census Bureau,7 the National Center for Health 
Statistics,8–10 and the Human Mortality Database.11 Cause of death was available as an 
International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) code prior to 1999 and as 
an International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth 
Revision (ICD-10) code after 1999.
Deaths and population were tabulated by county, age group (0, 1–4, 5–9, …, 75–79, and ≥80 
years), sex, year, and cause. County-level information on levels of education, income, race/
ethnicity, Native American reservations, and population density derived from data that were 
provided by the US Census Bureau and the National Center for Health Statistics also were 
used. More detail on these data sources is provided in eTable 1 in the Supplement. In a small 
number of cases, counties were combined to ensure historically stable units of analysis. A 
description of which counties were grouped together appears in eTable 2 in the Supplement.
Cause List and Redistribution of Nonspecific and Intermediate Causes of Death
The cause list developed for the Global Burden of Disease study1 was used for this analysis. 
This cause list is arranged hierarchically in 4 levels; within each level, the list is designed 
such that all deaths are assigned exactly 1 cause. All the causes from the Global Burden of 
Disease study cause list and the ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes that correspond to each cause 
appear in eTable 3 in the Supplement. The rules from the World Health Organization 
regarding use of the ICD codes require that the initiating condition of the causal chain of 
events leading to death be reported as the underlying cause of death. For example, ischemic 
heart disease has been considered an underlying cause of death across multiple revisions of 
the ICD.
Previous studies have documented the existence of nonspecific or intermediate causes in 
death registration data that may lead to misleading geographic and temporal patterns (for 
example, generalized atherosclerosis or heart failure assigned as an underlying cause of 
death).12,13 Algorithms developed for the Global Burden of Disease study1 were used to 
reallocate deaths assigned one of the “garbage codes” to plausible alternatives. First, 
plausible target causes were assigned for each garbage code or group of garbage codes. 
Second, deaths were reassigned to specified target codes according to proportions derived in 
1 of 4 ways: (1) published literature or expert opinion; (2) regression models; (3) according 
to the proportions initially observed among targets; and (4) for human immunodeficiency 
virus and AIDS specifically, by comparison to years before human immunodeficiency virus

 and AIDS became widespread. Although the focus of this study is cardiovascular diseases, 
all causes (ie, both cardiovascular diseases and other causes) were analyzed concurrently.
Small Area Models
Bayesian, spatially explicit mixed-effects regression models were estimated for all-cause 
mortality and for each cause in the Global Burden of Disease study1 hierarchy separately for 
males and females. The model for each cause was specified as:
where Dj,t,a, Pj,t,a, and mj,t,a are the number of deaths, the population, and the underlying 
mortality rate, respectively, for county j, year t, and age group a. The model for mj,t,a 
contained 6 components: an intercept (β0), fixed covariate effects (β1), random age-time 
effects (γ1,a,t), random spatial effects (γ2,j), random space-time effects (γ3,j and γ4,j,t), and 
random space-age effects (γ5,j and γ6,j,a). Seven covariates were included: the proportion of 
the adult population that has graduated from high school, the proportion of the population 
that has Hispanic ethnicity, the proportion of the population that has black race, the 
proportion of the population that has a race other than black or white, the proportion of a 
county that is contained within a state or federal Native American reservation, the median 
household income, and the population density. The random effects γ1,γ2, γ3 and γ5 were 
assumed to follow conditional autoregressive distributions14,15 that allow for smoothing over 
adjacent age groups and years (γ1) or counties (γ2, γ3 and γ5). The random effects γ4 and 
γ6 were assumed to follow independent mean-zero normal distributions.
Models were fit using the Template Model Builder package16 in R version 3.2.4 (R Project 
for Statistical Computing).17 A total of 1000 draws of mj,t,a were taken from the posterior 
distribution. These draws were raked5,18 (ie, scaled along multiple dimensions) to ensure 
consistency between levels of the cause hierarchy (ie, at each level the sum of all child 
causes is equal to the estimate for the corresponding parent cause) and to ensure consistency 
with the most recent national estimates produced by the Global Burden of Disease study.1 
Mortality rates for both sexes combined were calculated from the population-weighted 
average of the sex-specific mortality rates. Age-standardized mortality rates were calculated 
using the 2010 US census population as the standard, and years of life lost were calculated 
by multiplying the mortality rate by the population by the age-specific life expectancy from 
the standard life table used in the Global Burden of Disease study1 and then summing across 
all ages. Point estimates were calculated from the mean of all draws and 95% uncertainty 
intervals (UIs) were calculated from the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles. Changes over time 
were considered statistically significant if the posterior probability of an increase (or 
decrease) was 95% or greater. No explicit correction for multiple testing (ie, across multiple 
counties) was applied; however, modeling all counties simultaneously is expected to mitigate 
the risk of spuriously detecting changes due to multiple testing.

 Results
Geographic Variation in Mortality Due to All Types of Cardiovascular Disease
There were 31 992 547 deaths due to cardiovascular disease recorded between 1980 and 
2014 (eTable 4 in the Supplement describes the proportion of deaths originally assigned 
garbage codes). From 1980 to 2014, cardiovascular diseases were the leading cause of death 
in the United States, although the mortality rate declined from 507.4 deaths per 100 000 
persons in 1980 to 252.7 deaths per 100 000 persons in 2014, a relative decline of 50.2% 
(95% uncertainty interval [UI], 49.5%–50.8%) (eTable 5 in the Supplement). Cardiovascular 
diseases accounted for more than 846 thousand deaths (95% UI, 827–865 thousand deaths) 
and 11.7 million years of life lost (95% UI, 11.6–11.9 million years of life lost).
The Table summarizes the results for all cardiovascular disease causes in 2014 at the 
national and county level. The left side of the Table summarizes the burden of each cause at 
the national level in terms of deaths, years of life lost, and the age-standardized mortality 
rate. The right side of the Table summarizes the distribution of counties according to the 
estimated age-standardized mortality rate from each cause. Results by county for all years 
are available in an online visualization tool called US Health Map.
Among 3110 counties, large multicounty regions with the greatest age-standardized 
cardiovascular disease mortality rates (>90th percentile) were found throughout southeastern 
Oklahoma, the Mississippi River Valley, and eastern Kentucky (Figure 1A). States with the 
largest number of these counties included Mississippi (46 counties), Kentucky (38 counties), 
Oklahoma (38 counties), Tennessee (33 counties), Arkansas (28 counties), Louisiana (21 
counties), Georgia (20 counties), Texas (19 counties), Alabama (16 counties), and Missouri 
(14 counties). The lowest cardiovascular mortality rates were found in the counties 
surrounding San Francisco, California, central Colorado, northern Nebraska, central 
Minnesota, northeastern Virginia, and southern Florida.
Trends and Variation in Cardiovascular Disease Mortality
All but 2 counties in the United States had statistically significant declines in age-
standardized cardiovascular disease mortality rates between 1980 and 2014. The greatest 
absolute decline was observed in Menominee County, Wisconsin, where the mortality rate 
decreased 67.4% (95% UI, 62.2%–72.0%) from 862.0 (95% UI, 776.8–955.4) per 100 000 
persons to 281.3 (95% UI, 248.7–315.5) per 100 000 persons.
The gap in age-standardized cardiovascular disease mortality rates between counties at the 
10th and 90th percentile declined 14.6% from 172.1 deaths per 100 000 persons in 1980 to 
147.0 deaths per 100 000 persons in 2014 (posterior probability of decline >99.9%) and at 
the 1st and 99th percentile (eTable 6 and eTable 7 in the Supplement). This decrease in 
variation in cardiovascular disease mortality rates overall was largely the result of decreasing 
variation in mortality rates due to ischemic heart disease (ratio between counties at the 90th 
and 10th percentile in 2014 was 2.0 [119.1 vs 235.7] deaths per 100 000 persons) and 
cerebrovascular disease (ratio in 2014 was 1.7 [40.3 vs 68.1] deaths per 100 000 persons). 
The gap in mortality rates due to rheumatic heart disease and aortic aneurysm also decreased 
by a smaller amount. There were statistically significant increases in the gap between the

 10th and 90th percentile and the 1st and 99th percentile for cardiomyopathy and 
myocarditis, atrial fibrillation and flutter, peripheral arterial disease, endocarditis, and other 
cardiovascular and circulatory diseases. For other cardiovascular disease causes, the ratio 
ranged from 1.4 (aortic aneurysm: 3.5 vs 5.1 deaths per 100 000 persons) to 4.2 
(hypertensive heart disease: 4.3 vs 17.9 deaths per 100 000 persons).
Ischemic Heart Disease
Between 1980 and 2014, there were 21 191 274 deaths due to ischemic heart disease 
recorded in the United States. In 2014, the county-level age-standardized mortality rate due 
to ischemic heart disease ranged from 34.5 (95% UI, 30.0–39.2) per 100 000 persons in 
Pitkin County, Colorado, to 439.8 (95% UI, 405.1–477.6) per 100 000 persons in Franklin 
Parish, Louisiana (Figure 2). Counties with age-standardized mortality rates greater than the 
90th percentile in 2014 were found in 26 states. The largest concentration of counties greater 
than the 90th percentile extended from central Oklahoma to eastern Kentucky and along the 
Mississippi River Valley. Counties outside this area with age-standardized ischemic heart 
disease mortality rates above the 90th percentile include Sioux County, North Dakota; 
Buffalo County, South Dakota; Chenango County, New York; Ogemaw County, Michigan; 
Mineral County, Nevada; Appanoose County, Iowa; and Hamilton County, Illinois. Counties 
with age-standardized mortality rates less than the 10th percentile were found in 41 states, 
primarily in western states extending from California to Minnesota, but also the southern 
coast of Maine, parts of Vermont, northern Virginia, central North Carolina, and individual 
counties throughout many other states, including in the southeast.
Although the national age-standardized ischemic heart disease mortality rate declined 56.8% 
(95% UI, 55.8%–57.8%) from 358.8 (95% UI, 352.6–364.7) per 100 000 persons to 155.0 
(95% UI, 150.7–159.1) per 100 000 persons between 1980 and 2014, 7 counties had no 
detectable change in the age-standardized mortality rate due to ischemic heart disease. Only 
1 county experienced a significant increase (Franklin Parrish County, Louisiana: 30.1% 
[95% UI, 17.2%–44.9%] increase from 338.0 [95% UI, 312.4–364.4] per 100 000 persons to 
439.8 [95% UI, 405.1–477.6] per 100 000 persons). Decreases in ischemic heart disease 
mortality were widely distributed, as demonstrated by a percent decline in age-standardized 
ischemic heart disease mortality rate that was only weakly correlated with the original 
mortality rate in 1980 (correlation coefficient, 0.02; eFigure 1 in the Supplement).
Cerebrovascular Disease
There were 6 002 940 deaths due to cerebrovascular disease recorded between 1980 and 
2014. The county-level age-standardized mortality rate due to cerebrovascular disease in 
2014 ranged from 14.5 (95% UI, 13.0–16.2) per 100 000 persons in Summit County, 
Colorado, to 134.6 (95% UI, 127.6–141.9) per 100 000 persons in Angelina County, Texas 
(Figure 3). Counties with age-standardized mortality rates greater than the 90th percentile in 
2014 were found in 27 states, with most in the South. Counties with mortality rates greater 
than the 90th percentile were concentrated in Arkansas, Mississippi, Tennessee, Alabama, 
southern Virginia, central South Carolina, and Georgia. Counties with age-standardized 
mortality rates less than the 10th percentile were found in 42 states, with many clustered in 
the southwest, Colorado, New York, New England, and southern Florida.

 Counties in the 90th percentile for ischemic stroke mortality rates were predominantly in the 
South, but also included clusters in northern Idaho, North Dakota, Missouri, and Humboldt 
and San Luis Obispo counties in California (eFigure 2 in the Supplement). Counties with 
high hemorrhagic stroke mortality rates greater than the 90th percentile were far more 
concentrated in the South, representing a majority of counties in Arkansas, Mississippi, 
Alabama, Tennessee, Georgia, and South Carolina, comprising the majority of the counties 
above the 90th percentile (eFigure 3 in the Supplement).
The age-standardized cerebrovascular mortality rate declined in most counties; however, 
there were 8 counties with no detectable change in the age-standardized mortality rate due to 
cerebrovascular disease and 1 county in which the mortality rate increased significantly 
(Angelina County, Texas: 11.5% [95% UI, 3.2% to 20.4%] increase from 120.7 [95% UI, 
114.2 to 126.7] per 100 000 persons in 1980 to 134.6 [95% UI, 127.6 to 141.9] per 100 000 
persons in 2014). There was an inverse correlation between the percent change in age-
standardized cerebrovascular mortality rate and the mortality rate in 1980, with the highest 
risk counties having the largest decline in mortality rate (correlation coefficient, −0.44, 
eFigure 1 in the Supplement).
Hypertensive Heart Disease
There were 1 081 404 deaths due to hypertensive heart disease recorded between 1980 and 
2014. Counties with hypertensive heart disease mortality rates greater than the 90th 
percentile were clustered in the South, especially in Mississippi (Figure 4). Counties with 
hypertensive heart disease mortality rates less than the 10th percentile were found almost 
entirely outside the South, with the exception of Starr and Hidalgo counties in Texas, which 
are located on the border between the United States and Mexico and encompass the cities of 
McAllen and Rio Grande City, Texas, and a cluster of 9 centered on Harrisonburg in 
northern Virginia.
The mortality rate due to hypertensive heart disease declined in 1684 counties (916 
statistically significant) and increased in 1426 counties (651 statistically significant) between 
1980 and 2014. Large increases were found clustered throughout Oklahoma, Arkansas, 
western Mississippi, northern Louisiana, and northern Texas, ranging from a 2% to 8% 
annualized increase over this period.
Cardiomyopathy and Myocarditis
From 1980 to 2014, there were 967 291 deaths due to cardio-myopathy and myocarditis 
recorded in the United States. Counties with cardiomyopathy and myocarditis mortality rates 
greater than the 90th percentile were found predominantly in the South, including central 
Louisiana, central South Carolina, Georgia, and southern Virginia, but also clusters in rural 
northern California, Alaska, northern New York state, central Ohio, southeastern Indiana, 
and urban areas including Franklin County, Ohio (Columbus), Wayne County, Michigan 
(Detroit), and Miami-Dade County, Florida (Figure 5).
Many of the counties with a cardiomyopathy and myocarditis mortality rate less than the 
10th percentile were located in the Midwest and Mountain West extending south as far as the 
eastern Texas border with Mexico. The mortality rate due to cardiomyopathy and

 myocarditis increased for almost all counties after 1980, peaking in 1995 and then declining 
for almost all between 1995 and 2014.
Atrial Fibrillation
There were 314 988 deaths due to atrial fibrillation recorded between 1980 and 2014. 
Counties with an age-standardized mortality rate due to atrial fibrillation greater than the 
90th percentile were clustered throughout Oregon, northern California, Utah, Idaho, 
northeastern Montana, central Minnesota, areas east of Kansas City, Missouri, and 
southwestern West Virginia (Figure 6).
Counties less than the 10th percentile were clustered along the border between the United 
States and Mexico, South Dakota, Iowa, southern Florida, and along the Mississippi River 
from the southern tip of Illinois to the Gulf of Mexico. From 1980 to 2014, the mortality rate 
due to atrial fibrillation declined for counties clustered around Phoenix, Arizona, New 
Orleans, Louisiana, and Washington, DC, while increasing for most other counties.
Rheumatic Heart Disease
There were 355711 deaths due to rheumatic heart disease recorded between 1980 and 2014. 
Counties with an age-standardized mortality rate due to rheumatic heart disease greater than 
the 90th percentile were clustered in Alaska, Mississippi, Alabama, Kentucky, and Utah as 
well as smaller clusters in Georgia, South Carolina, and South Dakota (Figure 7). Counties 
less than the 10th percentile were clustered in western Washington, southern California, and 
Arizona, the Texas border with Mexico, central Iowa, North Dakota, South Dakota, southern 
Florida, Maryland, southern New York state, New Jersey, and Rhode Island.
The national mortality rate due to rheumatic heart disease declined by 51.9% (95% UI, 
49.2% to 54.4%) between 1980 and 2014. This decline was slowest throughout the South, 
however, and the age-standardized mortality rates due to rheumatic heart disease increased 
significantly in 2 counties: East Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana (34.5% [95% UI, 8.0% to 
68.1%] increase from 3.8 [95% UI, 3.3 to 4.4] per 100 000 persons in 1980 to 5.2 [95% UI, 
4.4 to 6.0] per 100 000 persons in 2014) and East Feliciana Parish, Louisiana (38.6% [95% 
UI, −1.5% to 91.3%] increase from 4.5 [95% UI, 3.6 to 5.6] per 100 000 persons in 1980 to 
6.2 [95% UI, 4.5 to 8.5] per 100 000 persons in 2014).
Aortic Aneurysm
From 1980 to 2014, there were 533 251 deaths due to aortic aneurysm recorded in the 
United States. Counties with an age-standardized mortality rate due to aortic aneurysm 
greater than the 90th percentile were scattered widely across the country, with the largest 
cluster in northern Minnesota and Wisconsin (Figure 8). Counties with mortality rates below 
the 10th percentile were found in the southern-most counties in California, Arizona, Texas, 
and Florida. The national mortality rate due to aortic aneurysm declined 49.4% (95% UI, 
46.2% to 52.2%) from 1980 to 2014.
Counties with the most rapid decline were in Alaska, California, and surrounding 
Washington, DC, whereas the counties with the slowest decline were clustered in Arkansas,

 Mississippi, Tennessee, and Minnesota. There was a moderate inverse correlation between 
the percent change in age-standardized aortic aneurysm mortality rate and the mortality rate 
in 1980, which was the strongest correlation found among cardiovascular disease causes in 
this analysis (correlation coefficient −0.52; eFigure 1 in the Supplement).
Peripheral Arterial Disease
There were 199 423 deaths due to peripheral arterial disease recorded between 1980 and 
2014. Counties with an age-standardized mortality rate due to peripheral arterial disease 
greater than the 90th percentile were found in small clusters throughout the South, in 
northern Michigan, in Wisconsin, and in many other states (Figure 9).
Mortality rates below the 10th percentile were found for many counties in the southwest, 
Colorado extending into southwestern Wyoming, in Alaska, in Mississippi, and in eastern 
New York state. Between 1980 and 2014, the national mortality rate due to peripheral 
arterial disease increased by 140% (95% UI, 117%–164%). During this same period, the gap 
between the 10th and 90th percentiles increased 163% from 0.5 to 1.4 per 100 000 persons 
(posterior probability of increase >99.9%).
Endocarditis
Between 1980 and 2014, 211 126 deaths due to endocarditis were recorded in the United 
States. Counties with mortality rates due to endocarditis greater than the 90th percentile 
were found in all but 16 states, with clusters in Alaska, the Mountain West, eastern 
Nebraska, northern Indiana, eastern Pennsylvania, upstate New York, southern Louisiana, 
and central Georgia (Figure 10).
Counties with rates below the 10th percentile were clustered in southern California, southern 
Texas, and in Iowa extending into southern Minnesota. The national mortality rate due to 
endocarditis increased by 45.7% (95% UI, 36.7%–54.0%) between 1980 and 2014, peaking 
in 2003 at 2.61 (95% UI, 2.52–2.69) deaths per 100 000. The largest declines since 2003 
occurred in clusters of counties across the Mountain West, in Iowa, and in Maryland.

There were 1 135 138 deaths due to other cardiovascular and circulatory diseases recorded 
between 1980 and 2014. In 2014, this category primarily consisted of nonrheumatic valvular 
disorders (71.9%) and phlebitis, thrombophlebitis, portal vein thrombosis, and other vein 
disorders (14.1%) (eTable 8 in the Supplement). Clusters of counties with rates for this 
category greater than the 90th percentile occurred in western areas of Washington and 
Oregon, northern California, eastern Texas, and eastern Georgia, whereas counties with rates 
less than the 10th percentile were found clustered along the border between the United 
States and Mexico, southern Florida, and North Dakota (eFigure 4 in the Supplement). There 
was only a slight decrease in the national mortality rate (12.3%; 95% UI, 6.4%–17.2%) with 
the fastest increase found among a cluster of counties in eastern Texas centered on the city 
of Tyler, Texas, and in coastal Oregon and Washington.

 Discussion
This analysis found extensive geographic variation in death due to 11 cardiovascular 
diseases. The absolute difference in county-level cardiovascular disease mortality rates 
declined substantially over the past 35 years for both ischemic heart disease and 
cerebrovascular disease. Despite this decline in absolute differences between counties, large 
differences remained in 2014. These findings suggest major efforts are still needed to reduce 
geographic variation in risk of death due to ischemic heart disease and cerebrovascular 
diseases.
Compared with other research,19–21 this study more broadly examined county-level patterns 
of death due to coronary and cerebrovascular arterial disease alone by including the first, to 
our knowledge, county-level analysis of death due to other major conditions, including 
diseases of the myocardium, atrial fibrillation, aortic and peripheral arterial diseases, 
rheumatic heart disease, and endocarditis. Comparable estimates have been produced by 
applying a uniform correction to nonspecific and intermediate garbage code causes of death. 
Consistency with all other causes of death, as well as national and global estimates, results 
from integration with the cause list developed for the ongoing Global Burden of Disease 
study.
This analysis reveals new patterns not observed when all cardiovascular deaths were 
considered together. For example, several cardiovascular disease conditions were clustered 
sub stantially outside the South, including atrial fibrillation (Northwest), aortic aneurysm 
(Midwest), and endocarditis (Mountain West and Alaska). Even though both the proportion 
of garbage codes and local practices for death reporting can vary by state, these clusters 
extend across state boundaries and most likely represent actual variation in disease mortality.
Data on trends and clustering of even rare causes of death can be an important source of 
public health information when data on disease incidence are unavailable. For example, high 
incidence of severe endocarditis has been described in Alaska separately from the finding of 
high mortality rates due to endocarditis.22 Using this analysis, new hotspots of 
cardiovascular disease were identified in locations such as Angelina County, Texas 
(cerebrovascular disease), and northern Michigan (peripheral arterial disease).
In contrast to the national trend for cardiovascular disease mortality rates as a whole, 
mortality rates due to atrial fibrillation, endocarditis, and peripheral arterial disease have 
increased since 1980. Tracking long-term trends in mortality for these less common causes 
of cardiovascular disease is important given that clinical and public health recommendations 
for screening and treatment continue to evolve, including rapid adoption of direct oral 
anticoagulants for atrial fibrillation,23 less frequent antibiotic prophylaxis for the prevention 
of endocarditis,24 and more percutaneous revascularization for peripheral arterial disease.25
Geographic variation in cardiovascular disease mortality in the Unites States has been noted 
since at least 1949.26 Thirty years ago researchers first noted an “enigma of the Southeast”27 
with high mortality rates in that region, often due to stroke, and a range of possible causes 
including environmental exposures related to coal and metal mining, housing and population 
density, and access to health care. A delay in the decline of stroke mortality has since been

 found in the stroke belt of the South but also outside the South, including Washington and 
Oregon.28 A stroke buckle has been identified as well, composed of the coastal plains of 
North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia.29 This analysis extends these findings to show 
additional counties with extremely high stroke mortality in California, Utah, North Dakota, 
South Dakota, and northern Idaho.
In 1986, researchers first reported the observation that the national cardiovascular mortality 
rate was actually “the weighted average of rates that were still increasing [in some regions] 
and those that had begun to decline” in others.30 Recent analysis of all types of 
cardiovascular disease mortality has shown a shift in high-mortality counties from the 
Northeast to the South, and higher rates of cardiovascular disease hospitalization for high-
mortality counties in southeast Oklahoma, Kentucky, and West Virginia.4,19 Efforts to 
explain these patterns have been more limited. Regional patterns in US county mortality 
have been associated with lower elevation and higher levels of small particulate air 
pollution.31,32 Regional variation in hospital outcomes following myocardial infarction also 
has been shown.33
The most comprehensive analysis of county-level cardiovascular disease risk factors to date, 
using data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey, showed wide variation in 
levels of obesity, tobacco smoking, hypertension, and physical inactivity within almost all 
states. Further investigation is needed to better understand regional variation in the factors 
that lead to cardiovascular disease deaths. These factors can best be understood in 3 major 
categories: (1) variation in the level of exposure to metabolic, behavioral, and environmental 
risks for the residents of a county; (2) variation in the delivery of interventions that can 
modify risk due to these exposures over time; and (3) delivery of high-quality emergency 
services and acute medical care that improve health outcomes when cardiovascular events 
occur. Tobacco smoking and obesity carry particularly high relative risks for atherosclerotic 
vascular disease. Previous modeling has suggested that half of reductions in cardiovascular 
disease in the United States has been due to medical treatment and half has been due to risk 
factor reduction.34
A broader exploration of the quality of both facility- and community-based health 
interventions in the lowest- and highest-risk counties would be an important first step in 
reducing cardiovascular disease differences. Counties with successful implementation of 
broad-based interventions to reduce cardiovascular disease have been well described.35 In 
particular, better county-level data are needed on dietary exposures, prehospital care, and 
access to high-quality chronic disease care. Exposure to risk early in life appears to be a 
particularly potent component of atherosclerotic vascular disease.36 Anonymized linkage of 
existing health data sources, including household surveys, electronic health records, and 
cardiovascular disease registries with other data on health and nonhealth exposures will be 
necessary to expand and improve cardiovascular disease surveillance.
Limitations
This analysis has several limitations. Vital statistics data and census population data were 
used to calculate mortality rates and both of these sources are subject to error because deaths 
and individuals within the population may be missed or allocated to the wrong county.

 Autopsy is considered the criterion standard for death certification and studies12 have 
demonstrated regional variation in misclassification bias in death certificates. An analysis of 
data from the Framingham Heart Study showed that death certificates were least accurate for 
individuals older than age 85 years and that no change in coding accuracy was observed over 
time.37 An analysis of deaths in Maryland showed that the amount of diagnostic information 
available to the certifying physician was associated with the reporting of chronic heart 
disease.38 To our knowledge, this is the first analysis of US county-level mortality that has 
applied a consistent method for correcting misclassification due to coding of unspecified or 
intermediate causes of death; however, the possibility of misclassification remains.
The transition from the 9th to the 10th version of the ICD coding system is an example of 1 
source of misclassification that the methods used in this analysis explicitly address. The 
ICD-10 system was implemented for coding death certificates in the United States in 1999 
and provided several thousand new and more detailed codes, a new alphanumeric coding 
scheme, and both renaming and regrouping of existing codes.39 This analysis accounts for 
this change in the ICD system by (1) mapping both versions of coding to a common list of 
cardiovascular disease conditions, (2) applying consistent methods for garbage code 
redistribution across all versions of the ICD, (3) ensuring that the sum of these conditions 
equals the total amount of cardiovascular disease deaths in which larger counts and more 
consistent coding markedly reduce the potential for discontinuity between 1998 and 1999, 
and (4) smoothing estimates over both space and time at the level of counties. Even with 
these adjustments, changes in the ICD system in 1999 can result in small shifts in estimation 
for less common conditions in small counties between 1998 and 1999 (eg, aortic aneurysm 
in Alpine County, California, and endocarditis in the Kusilvak census area of Alaska).
These findings demonstrate the importance of the state-level redistribution of nonspecific 
and intermediate causes of death implemented in our analysis. In addition, the modeling 
method smooths mortality estimates such that real variation among counties may be 
underestimated. Vital registration systems attribute deaths to county of residence at the time 
of death and, in this analysis, no correction to migration between counties was applied. 
Because of this, exposure to important environmental risk factors (eg, air pollution) may 
have occurred outside the county where a death was ultimately assigned. However, previous 
analyses have found the effect of county-to-county population migration on county-level 
variation in all-cause mortality to be small.40 In addition, patterns of death without 
correction for migration are of substantial interest to local policy makers and health systems.
Conclusions
Substantial differences exist between county ischemic heart disease and stroke mortality 
rates. Smaller differences exist for diseases of the myocardium, atrial fibrillation, aortic and 
peripheral arterial disease, rheumatic heart disease, and endocarditis.

 Key Points
Question
What are the trends and differences in cardiovascular disease mortality rates among US 
counties from 1980 to 2014?
Findings
In this study of small area estimation models applied to death records from the National 
Center for Health Statistics, the difference between county-level mortality rates declined 
substantially over the past 35 years for both ischemic heart disease and stroke; however, 
large differences remained in 2014. The largest concentration of counties with high 
cardiovascular disease mortality extended from southeastern Oklahoma along the 
Mississippi River Valley to eastern Kentucky, and several cardiovascular disease 
conditions were clustered substantially outside the South, including atrial fibrillation 
(Northwest), aortic aneurysm (Midwest), and endocarditis (Mountain West and Alaska).
Meaning
From 1980 to 2014, there were important changes in trends, patterns, and differences in 
cardiovascular disease mortality among US counties.

 Figure 6. US County-Level Mortality From Atrial Fibrillation and Flutter
A, Age-standardized mortality rate for both sexes combined in 2014. B, Percent change in 
the age-standardized mortality rate for both sexes combined between 1980 and 2014. In 
panels A and B, the color scale is truncated at approximately the 1st and 99th percentiles as 
indicated by the range given in the color scale. C, Age-standardized mortality rate in 1980, 
1990, 2000, and 2014. The bottom border, middle line, and top border of the boxes indicate 
the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles, respectively, across all counties; whiskers, the full range 
across counties; and circles, the national-level rate.

 Figure 9. US County-Level Mortality From Peripheral Arterial Disease
A, Age-standardized mortality rate for both sexes combined in 2014. B, Percent change in 
the age-standardized mortality rate for both sexes combined between 1980 and 2014. In 
panel A, the color scale is truncated at approximately the 1st and 99th percentiles as 
indicated by the range given on the scale. In panel B, the color scale is similarly truncated at 
the 99th percentile but not at the 1st percentile to avoid combining counties with decreases 
in the mortality rate and counties with increases in the mortality rate into a single group. C, 
Age-standardized mortality rate in 1980, 1990, 2000, and 2014. The bottom border, middle 
line, and top border of the boxes indicate the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles, respectively,
