Abstract The gastrointestinal (GI) tract plays a critical role
in delivering carbohydrate and fluid during prolonged
exercise and can therefore be a major determinant of per-
formance. The incidence of GI problems in athletes partici-
pating in endurance events is high, indicating that GI
function is not always optimal in those conditions. A sub-
stantial body of evidence suggests that the GI system is
highly adaptable. Gastric emptying as well as stomach
comfort can be ‘‘trained’’ and perceptions of fullness
decreased; some studies have suggested that nutrient-speci-
fic increases in gastric emptying may occur. Evidence also
shows that diet has an impact on the capacity of the intestine
to absorb nutrients. Again, the adaptations that occur appear
to be nutrient specific. For example, a high-carbohydrate diet
will increase the density of sodium-dependent glucose-1
(SGLT1) transporters in the intestine as well as the activity of
the transporter, allowing greater carbohydrate absorption
and oxidation during exercise. It is also likely that, whensuch
adaptations occur, the chances of developing GI distress are
smaller. Future studies should include more human studies
and focus on a number of areas, including the most effective
methods to induce gut adaptations and the timeline of
adaptations. To develop effective strategies, a better under-
standing of the exact mechanisms underlying these adapta-
tions is important. It is clear that ‘‘nutritional training’’ can
improve gastric emptying and absorption and likely reduce
the chances and/or severity of GI problems, thereby
improving endurance performance as well as providing a
better experience for the athlete. The gut is an important
organ for endurance athletes and should be trained for the
conditions in which it will be required to function.
1 Training the Gut
Athletes often underestimate the importance of the gas-
trointestinal (GI) tract. The supply of exogenous fluid and
carbohydrate sources can be critical to performance,
especially during prolonged exercise [1]. In addition, GI
symptoms such as bloating, cramping, diarrhea, and vom-
iting are common in many sports, especially endurance
sports [2]. Without a well-functioning GI system, delivery
of nutrients will be impaired and a range of GI symptoms
may develop. Clearly, the intestinal tract is highly adapt-
able, and it has been suggested that targeted training of the
intestinal tract may improve the delivery of nutrients dur-
ing exercise while at the same time alleviating some (or all)
of the symptoms [3]. This training, sometimes referred to
as ‘‘training the gut,’’ has received relatively little attention
in the literature, and to the best of my knowledge there are
no dedicated review articles on this topic. I provide a more
detailed overview of the evidence that the GI system can
adapt through nutritional training.
2 Gastric Emptying and ‘‘Stomach Training’’
Gastric emptying is an important step towards delivering
exogenous carbohydrate and fluids to the working muscle.
Anecdotally, athletes complain about drinks accumulating
in the stomach and feeling bloated, especially during high-
intensity [4] or very prolonged exercise in hot conditions.
Dehydration can contribute to this phenomenon and worsen

 complaints [4, 5]. Anecdotal evidence also shows that the
stomach can adapt to ingesting large volumes of fluid,
solids, or combinations. For example, serious contestants in
eating competitions are known to ‘‘train’’ their stomach to
hold larger volumes of food with less discomfort and—
through regular training—are able to eat volumes of food
within a small time window that are unthinkable for the
average and untrained person. The current all-time record
is 69 hot dogs (with bun) in 10 min. To achieve this,
competitive eaters train using a variety of methods:
chewing large pieces of chewing gum for longer periods of
time or stomach extension by drinking fluids or by eating
the
competition
foods.
Volumes
are
progressively
increased, and it takes many weeks to reach a level where
these eaters can be competitive. This demonstrates the
adaptability of the stomach. Conducting this ‘‘stomach
training’’ has two main effects: (1) the stomach can extend
and contain more food and (2) a full stomach is better
tolerated and is not perceived as so full. Both aspects could
be relevant to an exercise situation.
Current guidelines recommend fluid intakes during
exercise that prevent 2% dehydration (2% of body weight).
Recommended fluid intake can be substantial, especially in
trained athletes and hot conditions when sweat rates are
high. Such high intakes can cause discomfort and in some
cases GI problems. Therefore, athletes are generally
simultaneously managing GI comfort, hydration, and car-
bohydrate delivery. I and others have recommended
training for these higher intakes to reduce discomfort and
the chance of GI distress [3, 6, 7]. However, very few
studies have directly investigated such effects of ‘‘nutri-
tional training of the stomach.’’
Lambert et al. [8] showed that trained runners were able
to comfortably tolerate ingestion of a carbohydrate–elec-
trolyte solution at a rate approximately equal to their sweat
rate during 90 min of running at 65% maximum oxygen
uptake (VO2max) in a *25 �C, 30% relative humidity (RH)
environment. Interestingly, they observed that stomach
comfort significantly improved over time by practicing
these high intakes. It must be noted that this improved
comfort occurred without measurable changes in the rate of
gastric emptying [8]. Perhaps the stomach adapted by
extending the stomach walls to allow greater space for
fluid. This would likely reduce feelings of stomach dis-
comfort and reduce the stimulus for faster gastric empty-
ing. Training for intake of larger volumes could be an
effective strategy to avoid these problems in races, par-
ticularly for athletes who experience GI discomfort even
when ingesting relatively small volumes.
Studies have also demonstrated that gastric emptying of
carbohydrate can be accelerated by increasing dietary
intake of that carbohydrate. Cunningham et al. [9] supple-
mented the diet of two groups of volunteers with glucose
400 g per day for 3 days. The half emptying time (t�) for
the glucose test meal was significantly faster after the
standard diet had been supplemented with glucose com-
pared with the standard diet alone (median 20.7 min [range
4.6–36.8] vs. 29.1 [range 19.8–38.4]). Interestingly, the
gastric emptying of a protein drink was unchanged (median
18.0 min [range 12.5–23.6] vs. 16.1 [range 9.6–22.7]). The
authors concluded that rapid and specific adaptation of the
small intestinal regulatory mechanisms for gastric emptying
of nutrient solutions can occur in response to increases in
dietary load. Another study showed that supplementing a
standard diet with glucose 440 g per day for 4–7 days
accelerated gastric emptying of both glucose and fructose
(t� 82 ± 8 vs. 106 ± 10 min for glucose and 73 ± 9 vs.
106 ± 9 min for fructose) [10]. Plasma glucose-dependent
insulinotropic peptide (GIP) concentrations were higher
during the glucose-supplemented diet; thus the authors
concluded that the gastric emptying of both glucose and
fructose was accelerated probably as a result of reduced
feedback inhibition from intestinal luminal receptors [10].
One study showed that daily ingestion of fructose 120 g
for 3 days accelerated gastric emptying of fructose but not
of glucose [11]. It appears that the relatively short duration
of the dietary manipulation (3 days) was sufficient to cause
adaptations in gastric emptying.
Such observations are not specific for carbohydrate.
Studies have demonstrated that a higher-fat diet stimulated
gastric emptying. Cunningham et al. [12] demonstrated that
gastric emptying of a test meal was accelerated after 7 days
of a higher-fat diet (258 g/day). Reductions in t� of a test
meal in response to the intervention reached significance
after 14 days. Similar trends were observed after 4 days
but did not reach statistical significance, suggesting that
adaptations to fat in the diet may be slower than responses
to carbohydrate. Castiglione et al. [13] demonstrated a
similar adaptation after 14 days of a high-fat diet and
reported that these effects were highly specific to fats and
that a carbohydrate meal was emptied at the same rate
before and after a high-fat diet.
Adaptations are likely explained by desensitization of
nutrient receptors and reduced feedback inhibition of gas-
tric emptying. However, it is also possible that increased
absorption results in reduced exposure of receptors to
nutrients. Sections 6 and 7 provide evidence of increased
absorption of nutrients in response to changes in diet.
2.1 Stomach Training: Summary
Some studies have clearly demonstrated that specific
nutritional challenges result in specific adaptations of
gastric emptying to that challenge. For example, increased
dietary glucose intake increases the gastric emptying of
glucose but not protein, and increased fat intake results in
S102

 faster gastric emptying of fats but not carbohydrate. Very
few studies have specifically trained the gut to improve
tolerance and gastric emptying during exercise, but the
results
generally
look promising.
Effects
have
been
observed after 3 days of dietary manipulation.
3 Intestinal Sugar Transport
Once emptied from the stomach, most fluid and sugar
absorption will take place in the duodenum and jejunum.
Glucose and galactose are transported across the luminal
membrane of enterocytes by the sodium-dependent glucose
transporter (SGLT)-1 (Fig. 1).
3.1 Sodium-Dependent Glucose Transporter
(SGLT)-1
Absorption of glucose (and galactose) is coupled with
sodium transport and the associated electrochemical gra-
dient. An Na/K? ATP-ase, located at the basolateral
membrane, is responsible for maintaining the electro-
chemical gradient. There have been suggestions that glu-
cose transporter (GLUT)-2, another transporter, can be
recruited to the luminal membrane when high concentra-
tions of glucose are present in the lumen [14, 15]. This
theory of additional facilitated glucose transport remains
controversial, and SGLT1 is generally believed to be
responsible for the vast majority of absorption of dietary
sugars [16].
In most mammalian studies, SGLT1 has been shown to
be expressed on the brush border of enterocytes [17–21].
Expression levels are usually highest in the jejunum, fol-
lowed by the duodenum and ileum [22]. SGLT1 is not
expressed in the large intestine [22].
3.2 Glucose Transporter (GLUT)-5
Fructose uses a different transporter (GLUT5) to glucose
that is not sodium dependent and is highly specific to
fructose. The regulation of GLUT5 is more rapid than the
regulation of SGLT1. Changes in fructose transport are
typically paralleled by similar changes in GLUT5 mes-
senger RNA (mRNA) and protein abundance. In rats,
GLUT5 mRNA doubles within 3 h after intestinal perfu-
sion with a fructose solution [23]. It must be noted that
these effects have only been demonstrated at unnaturally
high fructose intakes (at least 30% of energy in the diet
coming from fructose, whereas a typical intake in a Wes-
tern diet is around 9%).
3.3 GLUT2
From the enterocyte to the systemic circulation, the sugars
need
to
pass
the
basolateral
membrane.
All
three
monosaccharides use the bidirectional transporter GLUT2,
which is also sodium independent. The capacity of GLUT2
to transport glucose across a concentration gradient is
believed to be very large [14, 15].

 3.4 Other Transporters
There is little evidence for other carbohydrate transporters
in addition to SGLT1 and GLUT5 transporters at the
luminal membrane and GLUT2 at the basolateral mem-
brane. There have been suggestions of other transporters,
but it seems that if they exist they will be relatively
unimportant for transport of carbohydrates from a quanti-
tative point of view. Since GLUT2 does not seem to be
limiting, I focus primarily on SGLT1 and GLUT5.
4 Carbohydrate Transporters and Glucose
Transport During Exercise
Regulation of carbohydrate transport proteins is essential
for the provision of glucose to the body in resting condi-
tions. Furthermore, during exercise, when exogenous
delivery of carbohydrate may be important for perfor-
mance, the transporters will be responsible for glucose
delivery to the working muscle. Exercise studies have
provided indirect but strong evidence that the delivery of
carbohydrate is limited by the transport capacity of SGLT1
(for reviews, see Jeukendrup [1, 6, 7] and Jeukendrup and
McLaughlin [3]). A recent review based primarily on more
direct measurements in animals also concluded that the
intestine has the capacity to absorb glucose via basal levels
of SGLT1 but that this capacity becomes limiting when
dietary carbohydrate exceeds a certain level [24].
At ingestion rates over 60–70 g of carbohydrate per h
(glucose, sucrose, maltose, maltodextrin, starch), exoge-
nous carbohydrate oxidation peaks around 60 g/h (Fig. 2)
[1, 3, 6, 7]. Even ingestion at 144 g/h [25] or 180 g/h [26]
did not increase exogenous carbohydrate oxidation rates
much above 60 g/h. Because this limitation was not caused
by gastric emptying, muscle glucose uptake, or liver
glycogen storage, it was deduced that absorption had to be
limiting [27]. When fructose was ingested in addition to
larger amounts of glucose, carbohydrate oxidation rates
were elevated above 60 g/h [28]. These studies strongly
suggested that glucose transport across the epithelial cell
was the limiting factor and that the maximal transport
capacity of SGLT1 was reached [29]. Because there also
appears to be a dose–response relationship between car-
bohydrate intake and performance [30–32], and it is likely
that a reduced capacity of the intestine in combination with
a higher carbohydrate intake may result in GI distress [2],
the search for ways to increase the capacity to absorb
carbohydrate continues.
Training the gut has been proposed as a way to increase
SGLT1 transporter number and/or activity, but evidence in
humans thus far is limited [6].
Using a segmental perfusion technique, Shi et al. [33]
reported a close relationship between water absorption and
solute absorption in the duodenojejunum, especially when
multiple transportable substrates are present (i.e., glucose,
sucrose, glycine, Na?). We confirmed this in humans
during
exercise:
multiple
transportable
carbohydrates
increased carbohydrate absorption and oxidation and this
was associated with increased fluid absorption [34].
Therefore, one other benefit of increasing the transport
capacity for carbohydrate is that fluid intake is likely to
also be improved (for a given carbohydrate intake).
Improved fluid absorption can help prevent dehydration
(and dehydration-induced reductions in performance), but
more complete absorption may also reduce the chances of
GI discomfort [2].
To develop practical recommendations, it is important to
understand the regulation of intestinal glucose transport. I
therefore discuss the regulation in more detail before pro-
viding suggestions for practical implication.
5 Regulation of Intestinal Glucose Transport
Regulation of glucose absorption has been shown to be
directly linked to the expression of SGLT1 protein. Bob
Crane proposed the existence of an Na?/glucose co-
Fig. 2 Schematic of exogenous carbohydrate oxidation from a single
carbohydrate (black) and multiple transportable carbohydrates (blue),
based on data presented elsewhere [3, 7, 51, 52]. It is clear that higher
oxidation rates can be achieved with multiple transportable carbohy-
drates, especially at high intakes. At intakes up to 60 g/h, there is no
difference between single and multiple transportable carbohydrates,
but when intake increases above 60 g/h and the sodium-dependent
glucose transporter 1 (SGLT1) becomes saturated, added fructose will
result in higher exogenous carbohydrate oxidation rates. The recom-
mended intake for single and multiple transportable carbohydrates are
indicated with a circle. If single carbohydrate sources are ingested at
rates higher than 60 g/h, gastrointestinal problems are likely. With
multiple transportable carbohydrates, fewer symptoms have been
observed, but ‘‘training the gut’’ (and getting used to high intakes) is
recommended

 transport in 1960 at the Symposium on Membrane Trans-
port and Metabolism in Prague [35], but the actual trans-
porter was not identified until the 1980s [36]. Studies in the
1960s also observed that dietary carbohydrate intake can
influence the capacity to absorb glucose [37]. In 1983, it
was demonstrated that intestinal transporters were upreg-
ulated and downregulated depending on dietary composi-
tion [38]. At least in rats, it appears that dietary changes do
not have to be extreme to observe effects on absorption,
and these effects have been seen not only for sugars but
also for amino acids [38]. Increases in absorption have
been observed in as little as 0.5 days in rats [38]. It was
also observed very early on that digestive enzymes were
upregulated in response to dietary composition. For
example, Deren et al. [39] demonstrated in 1967 that rats
who were fasted for 3 days displayed fourfold increases in
sucrase and maltase activity in response to a sucrose diet
compared with a casein diet [39]. This was correlated with
increases in sucrose hydrolysis and in fructose absorption.
When sugar transporters were identified in the gut in the
1980s, studies started to measure changes in SGLT1 con-
tent and activity in response to diet. A number of rodent
models [18, 40] have shown that both the activity and the
abundance of SGLT1 is regulated by dietary carbohydrate
intake. It is clear that SGLT1 protein responds to glucose
concentrations in the lumen. However, SGLT1 was stim-
ulated to the same degree when membrane-impermeable
glucose analogues were used [41], suggesting that a glu-
cose sensor detects glucose or its analogues, initiating the
upregulation of the SGLT1 transporters.
5.1 Sensing Mechanism
Specialized cells (L cells and K cells) in the intestinal
luminal membrane have been shown to express taste
receptor cells. In particular, it has been demonstrated that
T1R2 and T1R3 receptors detect sweetness. The T1R2 and
T1R3 cells are coupled through a G-protein (alpha-gust-
ducin) to a cascade of downstream cellular events that
ultimately lead to upregulation of SGLT1. A more detailed
discussion of the potential pathways involved is provided
in the following sections.
5.2 Sweeteners and Other Analogues
SGLT1 is upregulated in response not only to dietary
carbohydrate but also to sweeteners. Margolskee et al. [17]
confirmed earlier findings that SGLT1 protein expression
in wild-type mice receiving a diet supplemented with
carbohydrate almost doubled compared with mice receiv-
ing a low-carbohydrate diet. However, SGLT1 expression
also doubled when the low-carbohydrate diet was supple-
mented with the sweeteners sucralose, acesulfame K, or
saccharine, but not when supplemented with aspartame.
The observation that aspartame had no effect is not sur-
prising because it is known that mice do not experience
aspartame as sweet.
5.3 Other Dietary Constituents that Regulate
Intestinal Glucose Transport
A number of dietary constituents have been implicated in
the regulation of glucose transport. Sodium chloride con-
sumption appears to modulate intestinal glucose transport.
Studies suggest that chronically elevated luminal concen-
trations of glucose and sodium will lead to increased
expression of the SGLT1 protein [42]. There are still many
questions about the mechanisms and whether the effects of
sodium and glucose are additive [43].
Dietary fiber is another constituent with potential
effects, but studies have been inconclusive: some studies
show a decrease, some show no change, and some show an
increase in intestinal glucose transport with increasing
dietary fiber intake [43]. Fiber is a broad term used to
describe vastly different characteristics, and fiber can have
effects on gastric emptying, motility, and the composition
and structure of the intestinal tract. Therefore, it may not be
surprising that results of studies have been inconclusive.
To the best of my knowledge, no studies in humans have
investigated the effects of dietary constituents on intestinal
glucose absorption. Therefore, developing firm guidelines
in the absence of these findings would be premature.
5.4 Molecular Mechanisms
SGLT1 protein is upregulated in response to a number of
stimuli, including but not limited to glucose and galactose:
3-O-methylglucose
(non-metabolizable
substrate
of
SGLT1) and fructose (not a substrate of SGLT1). Upreg-
ulation of the SGLT1 protein depends on the availability of
these sugars, but metabolism of these sugars is not neces-
sary. The fact that SGLT1 expression responds to glucose
analogues and sugars not transported by SGLT1 suggests
there is a separate receptor that detects these glucose
analogues.
Studies have suggested that the sugar-mediated upreg-
ulation of SGLT1 is likely to involve a G-protein-coupled
second
messenger
pathway
[41,
44]
(Fig. 3).
More
recently, it was demonstrated in mice that T1R3 and
gustducin are expressed in enteroendocrine cells and are
required for the expression of SGLT1 in vivo in response to
luminal sugars or sweeteners [17]. SGLT1, on the other
hand, is expressed in enterocytes (Fig. 3). This means that
a signaling event must take place between chemosensory
enteroendocrine cells and absorptive enterocytes. It is
known that enteroendocrine cells can secrete endocrine
Training the Gut for Athletes

 hormones such as cholecystokinin (CCK), peptide tyrosine
tyrosine (PYY), neurotensin, glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-
1, GLP-2, and GIP. The incretins GLP-1 and GIP are
secreted in response to dietary sugars and influence glucose
transport, metabolism, and homeostasis. Shirazi-Beechey
et al. [24] described a possible pathway of regulation.
Sweet receptors T1R2 ? T1R3, expressed on the luminal
membrane of villus endocrine cells, sense the luminal
concentration of glucose. When this glucose concentration
reaches a threshold, it activates a signaling cascade in
endocrine cells that involves T1R2 ? T1R3 receptors,
gustducin and other signaling elements. This will result in
the secretion of GLP-1, GLP-2, and GIP. The binding of
GLP-2 to its receptor on enteric neurons elicits an action
potential. This stimulus is transmitted to sub-epithelial
regions by axonal projections. This will evoke the release
of a neuropeptide in the absorptive enterocytes. The
binding of this neuropeptide to its receptor results in
increased intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate
(cAMP) concentrations, thereby increasing the stability of
mRNA of SGLT1 and increasing the SGLT1 protein
concentration.
GIP has been shown to directly regulate SGLT1 and
enhance absorption in the mouse jejunum. In turn,
increased glucose absorption also has an effect on GIP
secretion [45]. Recent studies have demonstrated that a GIP
receptor knockout had marked effects on SGLT1 expres-
sion, suggesting that GIP plays an important role in the
upregulation of SGLT1 [46].
Several aspects of this mechanism remain untested, and
some aspects have been disputed [16], but it is clear that
somehow luminal glucose is sensed and—through a sig-
naling cascade—SGLT1 function protein levels increase.
5.5 Time Course
In mice, intestinal SGLT1 protein in brush–border mem-
brane vesicles in the mid small intestine increased 1.9-fold
after 2 weeks of a high-carbohydrate diet [17]. In a study of
horses, which are believed to be slow adapters to an
increase in carbohydrate, SGLT1 protein expression from
intestinal biopsies was increased after just 1 week of high-
carbohydrate feeding, and the abundance increased further
after 1 and 2 months on the diet. Piglets who received a

T1R2 ? T1R3, expressed on the luminal membrane of villus

glucose concentration reaches a threshold, it activates a signaling
cascade in endocrine cells that involves T1R2 ? T1R3 receptors,
gustducin, and other signaling elements. This will result in the
secretion of GLP-1, GLP-2, and GIP. GLP-2 binding to its receptor
GLP-2R on enteric neurons elicits an action potential. This stimulus,
in turn, is transmitted to sub-epithelial regions by axonal projections,
which will evoke the release of a neuropeptide in the absorptive
enterocytes. The binding of this neuropeptide to its receptor increases
intracellular cAMP concentrations, thereby increasing the stability of
mRNA of SGLT1 and increasing the SGLT1 protein concentration.

 higher-carbohydrate diet for 3 days showed increases of
SGLT1 protein as well as glucose absorption [47].
Although no direct human studies exist, a large number
of animal studies suggest that the time course of changes in
SGLT1 expression is relatively rapid. Several studies have
observed significant changes after only a few days of
dietary change [17]. It seems therefore reasonable to sug-
gest that several days of a high-carbohydrate intake can
increase SGLT1 content and the capacity to absorb glu-
cose, but more prolonged exposure to the diet could result
in greater adaptations.
6 Regulation of Absorption in Athletes
An elegant study by Cox et al. [48] gives us the most
important clues today that diet manipulation can result in
improved delivery of carbohydrate during exercise. In this
study, 16 endurance-trained cyclists were divided into a
high-carbohydrate and a control group. For 28 days, both
groups
trained
(16 h/week)
and
their
performance
improved as a result of this training. Both groups received
a diet with a moderate carbohydrate content (5 g/kg/day).
The high-carbohydrate group were supplemented with an
additional 1.5 g/kg per hour of exercise performed daily.
The carbohydrate supplement was provided mainly in the
form of a glucose drink. In addition, they received carbo-
hydrate-rich foods to meet the hourly demands of exercise.
The control group also received a nutritional supplement,
but this was composed of fat- and protein-rich foods with
limited carbohydrate content. Subjects in the high-carbo-
hydrate groups consumed the supplements before, during,
and immediately after exercise. The cyclists in the control
group consumed their supplement after exercise. On
average, the carbohydrate-supplemented group had a high
daily carbohydrate intake of 8.5 g/kg, whereas the control
groups consumed 5.3 g/kg/day.
Before and after the 28-day training period, all subjects
performed an exercise trial in which they received a 10%
carbohydrate solution. Isotopic tracers were used to mea-
sure the oxidation of the exogenous carbohydrate. It was
observed that exogenous carbohydrate oxidation was
improved after the carbohydrate-supplemented diet. The
most likely explanation is an increase in the ability to
absorb carbohydrate as a result of an upregulation of
SGLT1 transporters. It was concluded that, for athletes who
compete in endurance events, where exogenous carbohy-
drate is an important energy source and there is ample
opportunity to ingest carbohydrate, this higher carbohy-
drate intake approach may be beneficial [6, 7, 48].
It has become clear that an increase in dietary carbohy-
drate intake can increase the abundance and activity of
intestinal SGLT1 transporters and that this results in an
improved capacity to absorb carbohydrate. The reverse may
also be true. With carbohydrate restriction through reducing
carbohydrate intake, high-fat, or even ketogenic diets, or by
reducing total energy intake, the daily carbohydrate intake
can become very low. Studies in lambs have demonstrated
that, as the diet changes from milk to grass, so the rumen,
where dietary carbohydrates are fermented into volatile
fatty acids, develops. Rumen formation effectively prevents
the delivery of monosaccharides to the intestine. As a result,
there is a marked decrease in both the SGLT1 protein
content of the intestine as well as the capacity of the small
intestine to absorb carbohydrate [49, 50].
7 Gastrointestinal Problems
GI problems are very common amongst athletes, and
30–50% of all athletes experience such problems regularly
[2]. The causes are still largely unknown but appear to be
partly genetically determined and highly individual [2].
The mechanisms are likely to be different for upper and
lower GI problems. The symptoms are more likely to occur
and are exacerbated by hot weather conditions and dehy-
dration [2].
Although a link with nutrition intake is not always
found, certain practices have been found to correlate with
the incidence of GI problems: fiber intake, fat intake, and
highly
concentrated
carbohydrate
solutions
seem
to
increase the prevalence of GI problems.
There are probably several reasons for these problems,
but two important and common reasons may be a bloated
feeling and reduced gastric emptying during prolonged
exercise, and diarrhea as a result of osmotic shifts.
It is thought that training the gut may alleviate some of
these symptoms, perhaps by improving gastric emptying
and the perception of fullness (reduced bloating), improv-
ing tolerance of larger volumes, and increasing the speed of
absorption, causing less residual volume and smaller
osmotic shifts [2].
8 Practical Implications and Conclusions
A summary of practical implications is depicted in Fig. 4.
While
some
extrapolations
from
animal
studies
are
required, it is likely that adaptations in the human intestine
are as rapid as those seen in other mammals. This means
that several days and certainly 2 weeks of a high-carbo-
hydrate diet would result in significant increases in the
SGLT1 content of the intestinal lumen. Based on animal
data, an increase in dietary carbohydrate from 40 to 70%
could result in a doubling of SGLT1 transporters over a
period of 2 weeks.
Training the Gut for Athletes
S107
123
 In addition to an increased absorptive capacity, it is
essential that higher carbohydrate intakes can be tolerated
and are also emptied from the stomach. Although it is
generally believed that gastric emptying is not a limiting
factor, it is likely that a combination of factors (for
example, heat, high carbohydrate intake, and high-intensity
exercise, which are all factors known to inhibit gastric
emptying) will act together, thereby compromising gastric
emptying. Therefore, it is important to practice a race
nutritional strategy in training and get used to higher vol-
umes of intake or higher carbohydrate intakes.
Most athletes consume a moderate- to high-carbohy-
drate diet, and it could therefore be argued that the benefits
of increasing carbohydrate intake even more may only be
small. At present, the link between daily carbohydrate
intake and the transport capacity for glucose in the human
intestine is uncertain. Perhaps the fact that we have seen
little variation in the maximum exogenous carbohydrate
oxidation rates in many years of research involving hun-
dreds of participants is a sign that diet has relatively small
effects on the maximal carbohydrate transport capacity of
the gut. The fact that transport capacity has hardly ever
exceeded 60 g/h, even in individuals, may be a sign that
improvements may not be dramatic. On the other hand,
research such as the study by Cox et al. [48] suggests that
these transporters can be upregulated in a relatively short
period of time.
Although the exact magnitude of effects in athletes who
are already consuming a high-carbohydrate diet may be
uncertain, it seems fair to conclude that those athletes who
are not practicing a high-carbohydrate diet can benefit
substantially. When athletes are carbohydrate restricting;
following a low-carbohydrate, high-fat, or ketogenic diet;
or are reducing energy intake to lose weight, the reduced
daily carbohydrate load will likely reduce the capacity to
absorb carbohydrates during competition. This could be a
reason why these athletes anecdotally seem to report more
GI problems. These athletes would be advised to include
some high-carbohydrate days in their training.
Current guidelines recommend a carbohydrate intake up
to about 60 g for exercise lasting for up to 2 h. When the
exercise lasts C2 h, slightly greater amounts of carbohy-
drate (90 g/h) would be recommended, and these carbo-
hydrates
should
consist
of
a
mix
of
multiple
transportable carbohydrates, e.g., glucose:fructose or mal-
todextrin:fructose. To obtain a carbohydrate intake of 90 g/
h, athletes could ‘‘mix and match’’ to fulfil their personal
preferences and take into account their tolerance [6, 7].
Since the gut is so adaptable, it seems wise to include
training with high-carbohydrate intake into the weekly
routine and regularly ingest carbohydrate during exercise.
With these strategies, the gut may be trained to absorb and
oxidize more carbohydrate, which in turn should result in
less GI distress and better performance.
