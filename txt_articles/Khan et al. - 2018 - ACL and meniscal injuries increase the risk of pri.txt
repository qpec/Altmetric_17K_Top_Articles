Objectives The aim of this study was to investigate 
whether ACL injury (ACLi) or meniscal injury increases 
the risk of end-stage osteoarthritis (OA) resulting in total 
knee replacement (TKR).
Methods A matched case–control study of all TKRs 
performed in the UK between January 1990 and July 
2011 and recorded in the Clinical Practice Research 
Datalink (CPRD) was undertaken. The CPRD contains 
longitudinal data on approximately 3.6 million patients. 
Two controls were selected for each case of TKR, 
matched on age, sex and general practitioner location 
as a proxy for socioeconomic status. Individuals with 
inflammatory arthritis were excluded. The odds of having 
TKR for individuals with a CPRD-recorded ACLi were 
compared with those without ACLi using conditional 
logistic regression, after adjustment for body mass 
index, previous knee fracture and meniscal injury. The 
adjusted odds of TKR in individuals with a recorded 
meniscal injury compared with those without were 
calculated.
results After exclusion of individuals with inflammatory 
arthritis, there were 49 723 in the case group and 
104 353 controls. 153 (0.31%) cases had a history of 
ACLi compared with 41 (0.04%) controls. The adjusted 
OR of TKR after ACLi was 6.96 (95% CI 4.73 to 10.31). 
4217 (8.48%) individuals in the TKR group had a 
recorded meniscal injury compared with 669 (0.64%) 
controls. The adjusted OR of TKR after meniscal injury 
was 15.24 (95% CI 13.88 to 16.69).
Conclusion This study demonstrates that ACLi is 
associated with a sevenfold increased odds of TKR 
resulting from OA. Meniscal injury is associated with a 
15-fold increase odds of TKR for OA.
InTrOduCTIOn
The ACL and the menisci are key functional struc-
tures in the knee and both are frequently injured. 
Meniscal tears are the most common knee injury, 
with an estimated prevalence between 2.5 and 4 
times higher than ACL rupture.1–4 The estimated 
annual incidence of ACL injury (ACLi) has been 
reported as high as 0.8 per 1000 population.5 The 
menisci are key structures in the distribution of load 
across the joint, and the ACL is one of the principal 
stabilising ligaments that couple tibial and femoral 
movement.6–8 
There is convincing evidence that both injuries 
are associated with an increased risk of developing 
knee osteoarthritis (OA) at long-term follow-up. 
ACLi predisposes the knee to radiographic OA at a 
mean follow-up of over 10 years when comparing 
injured 
knees 
with 
uninjured 
contralateral 
knees.9 10 Meniscal injury and meniscectomy lead to 
an increase in peak compressive and shear stresses 
on the articular cartilage.11 In the longer term, 
Lohmander et al2 reported that approximately 
50% of individuals who had undergone meniscec-
tomy 10–20 years previously demonstrated signs of 
radiographic OA.
While the risk of developing OA has been 
established, there is limited evidence that ACL or 
meniscal injury is associated with progression to 
end-stage knee OA and the eventual need for joint 
replacement. Few studies reporting the functional 
and symptomatic outcomes of ACLi include more 
than 10 
years of follow-up data.12 In a similar 
manner the quantitative effect of meniscal injury on 
the risk of end-stage OA is not known.
Painful end-stage OA is often effectively treated 
by total knee replacement (TKR),13 with more than 
670 000 performed in the USA alone in 2012.14 As 
pain and extent of radiographic OA are key vari-
ables in the decision to perform a TKR,15–17 joint 
replacement acts as a useful surrogate for end-stage 
OA and has been used in pharmacological studies as 
a marker of severe osteoarthritic disease.18 19 Within 
the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD), 
ACLi, meniscal injury and joint replacement are all 
coded, which allows their interrelationship to be 
investigated.
The purpose of this case–control study was to 
compare and quantify the risk of undergoing a TKR 
for knee OA in individuals with a history of ACL 
rupture or meniscal injury with the risk for individ-
uals without a prior ACL rupture or meniscal injury.

population) registered at 480 general practices in the UK. It is 
generally considered that individuals recorded in the CPRD are 
representative of the wider UK population in terms of age, sex 
and socioeconomic status.20 General practices record patient 
demographics, consultations, diagnoses, specialist referrals, 
hospital treatment, prescriptions and test results. ‘Read codes’ 
are used to enter clinical information, which are standard clinical 
terminologies used within the UK primary care. The data quality 
is regulated by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regula-
tory Authority.
Participants
All patients in the CPRD with a diagnosis code for TKR from 
January 1990 until July 2011 were identified. Previously vali-
dated Read codes were used to identify primary TKRs.20–22 
Individuals with a code for primary TKR were included in the 
analysis if they were aged 18 years and older at the time of TKR, 
and those with a recorded diagnosis of inflammatory arthritis 
were excluded from the study.
Each case of primary TKR recorded in the CPRD (case group) 
and fulfilling the inclusion criteria was matched to two controls 
(control group). The criteria for matching cases to controls 
were on the basis of age, sex and General Practice, which served 
to control for the confounding effects related to location of resi-
dence, such as access to healthcare and affluence of the area. 
Controls were selected by the CPRD knowledge centre, based on 
incidence density random sampling from the individuals avail-
able in CPRD fulfilling the matching criteria described, for each 
case subject.
The CPRD medical dictionary was used to search for Read 
codes for ACLi. Read codes that referred to ACL and meniscal 
injuries were selected by the first author and these were veri-
fied by coinvestigators (two orthopaedic surgeons and one 
statistician).
data management and statistical analysis
Data management and statistical analysis were performed using 
STATA SE V
.12. Demographics of the case and control groups 
were compared using χ2 test for categorical variables and t-test 
for continuous variables. The odds of having a TKR for individ-
uals with ACLi recorded as an event were compared with those 
without ACLi using conditional logistic regression. The results 
were adjusted for body mass index (BMI), previous fractures 
around the knee and history of meniscal injury. BMI data were 
missing for 25 
282 (16.4%) individuals. Multiple imputation 
methods were used in order to account for missing BMI infor-
mation.23 24
The conditional logistic regression model was also used 
to determine the unadjusted and adjusted odds (adjusted for 
previous fractures around the knee, a history of ACLi and BMI) 
of undergoing TKR for individuals with meniscal injury recorded 
as an event compared with those without a documented meniscal 
injury.
To establish the odds of TKR for individuals with both a 
recorded ACLi and a meniscal injury compared with those with 
a history of ACLi only, an interaction term was added to the 
conditional logistic regression model.
We hypothesised that entry of individuals with ACLi or 
meniscal injury onto the CPRD might have become more robust 
in later years, due to an increased access to MRI scans, which may 
impact the comparative odds. Hence, we conducted a sensitivity 
analysis where TKR cases performed before 1 January 2000 and 
matched controls were excluded.
resulTs
Within the study period, 52 
530 patients in the CPRD had a 
primary TKR for any indication and were matched to 105 
060 
controls. After excluding patients with a recorded diagnosis of 
inflammatory arthritis, there were 49 
723 individuals with TKR 
and 104 
353 controls.
The mean age of matched individuals was 70.4 (SD 9.5) and 
57.5% of them were women. BMI was higher for the TKR group. 
The clinical characteristics of the two groups are summarised in 
table 1.
One hundred and fifty-three (0.31%) TKR cases had sustained 
an ACLi compared with 41 (0.04%) controls. The unadjusted 
OR of undergoing TKR, within the 20-year period, in individ-
uals with a recorded ACLi compared with individuals with no 
history of ACLi was 8.00 (95% CI 5.61 to 11.42). Following 
multivariable adjustment, the adjusted OR was 6.96 (95% CI 
4.73 to 10.31).
There were 4217 (8.48%) cases who had a recorded diagnosis 
of meniscal injury compared with 669 (0.64%) controls. The 
unadjusted and adjusted ORs (adjusted for BMI, ACLi and frac-
tures around the knee) for TKR in individuals with a recorded 
meniscal injury versus those without were 15.31 (95% CI 13.99 
to 16.75) and 15.24 (95% CI 13.88 to 16.69), respectively. 
Fractures around the knee and BMI, which were both strongly 
associated with risk of TKR, were included in the final model 
(table 2).
Table 3 summarises the characteristics of TKR patients in indi-
viduals with a previous ACLi and those without. Age at TKR 
was significantly lower in individuals who had a recorded ACLi 
(P<0.0001) compared with those without a previous ACLi. Indi-
viduals with a recorded meniscal injury were also significantly 
younger at time of TKR than those without a previous meniscal 
injury (P<0.0001).
Thirty-nine (0.07%) individuals in the case group had a 
recorded diagnosis of both ACLi and meniscal injury compared 
with three (0.003%) individuals in the control group (P<0.001). 
The adjusted OR for TKR in individuals with both a recorded 
ACL and meniscal injury compared with those with only an 
ACLi recorded was 4.19 (95% CI 1.05 to 16.66).

In a sensitivity analysis excluding patients who underwent 
TKR before 1 January 2000, there were 42 
722 cases and 88 
929 
controls available for analysis. The unadjusted OR of TKR in 
individuals with an ACLi versus those without was 7.74 (95% 
CI 5.42 to 11.06). After adjusting for BMI, previous fractures 
around the knee and a history of meniscal injury, the OR was 
6.81 (95% CI 4.59 to 10.11). For meniscal injury, the unadjusted 
odds of TKR was 15.46 (95% CI 14.06 to 17.00). After adjust-
ment for BMI, history of ACLi and previous fractures around the 
knee, the OR was 15.38 (95% CI 13.96 to 16.96)
dIsCussIOn
This matched case–control study demonstrates that ACL and 
meniscal injuries are both significant independent risk factors 
for end-stage OA treated by TKR, with an estimated 7-fold and 
15-fold increased odds, respectively. This is the first epidemio-
logical study to quantify this important link based on 20-year 
longitudinal data. Individuals who underwent TKR after ACL or 
meniscal injury were found to be significantly younger at time 
of TKR than those without a previously recorded diagnosis of 
these injuries.
A number of previous studies have demonstrated a high 
incidence of radiographic OA after ACLi.25–29 From relatively 
small cohort studies, it is difficult to quantify the influence of 
ACL rupture on the long-term risk of developing OA without a 
control group of uninjured patients. Ajuied and colleagues,9 in 
a meta-analysis, reported a relative risk of 3.84 for developing 
moderate or severe radiological OA (Kellgren and Lawrence 
grade III or IV) at a mean of 10 years of follow-up in ACL-in-
jured individuals compared with those with no history of ACLi. 
Due to the case–control design of the present study, relative 
risk cannot be calculated directly, but the ORs can be used as a 
measure of the strength of the association between exposure and 
outcome. In comparison with Ajuied and colleagues’s meta-anal-
ysis, although similar, the overall probability of OA appears 
higher in the present study. There are several possible expla-
nations for this. First, the follow-up period was substantially 
longer in the present study, which is likely to contribute to the 
difference. Second, the meta-analysis assessed studies comparing 
radiographic changes in the ACL injured with the contralateral 
uninjured knee within individuals. In contrast, the present study 
compared odds in individuals with a recorded diagnosis of ACLi 
with those without. The present study is therefore likely to be a 
closer estimate of the probability of end-stage OA attributable to 
ACLi within the population.
Studies reporting the long-term outcomes of surgically treated 
meniscal injuries have demonstrated a similar association to 
the present study with an increased risk of OA.30 31 In a recent 
systematic review of OA after total or partial meniscectomy, 
Papalia et al31 reported an overall mean prevalence of OA of 
53% on the operated knee, compared with a range of 0%–44% 
in the contralateral non-operated knee at a mean follow-up of 
13.3 years. Furthermore, early structural changes following 
meniscal injury and meniscectomy, which result in an increased 
risk of developing radiographic OA, have been reported.30 32 
Roemer et al using data from the Osteoarthritis Initiative, demon-
strated that the presence of MRI-detected meniscal damage 2 
years prior to incident radiographic OA increased the risk of 
incident radiographic OA. The OR for the medial meniscus was 
1.83 (95% CI 1.17 to 2.89) and 1.56 (95% CI 0.85 to 2.84) for 
lateral meniscus.32 In the present study we have demonstrated a 
previously unreported significant association between meniscal 
injury and end-stage knee OA resulting in TKR. It is likely that 
some, but not all, of the individuals identified in the case and 
control groups with a prior diagnosis of meniscal injury would 
have received surgical treatment. The Read codes used were to 
identify individuals in the CPRD with an acute meniscal injury 
as opposed to meniscal surgery as this could introduce a poten-
tial confounder due to some patients undergoing meniscectomy 
having degenerate meniscal tears in association with established 
OA. Although we cannot comment on whether or not the 
method of treatment of acute meniscal injury influences the risk 
of developing severe OA, this study provides important insight 
into the natural history of this condition.
The present study has some limitations. As in any case–control 
study, there is the possibility of recall bias, although this is mini-
mised in studies based on electronic medical records, where 
both the outcome (TKR) and the previous exposure (here 
ACLi and meniscal injury) were coded at the time when they 
happened. Nevertheless, the risk of more accurate recording of 
orthopaedic surgery among patients diagnosed with an ACLi or 
meniscal injury, as well as an increased provision of TKR for 
patients previously in contact with orthopaedic surgery (due to 
ACLi or meniscal injury), leads to similar issues (ie, Berkson’s 
bias33). We were limited by the recording of ACL and meniscal 
injuries in the CPRD, and no individual validation of exposure 
or event has been undertaken. However, if such diagnoses were 
under-recorded, this is likely to affect both the case and control 
groups approximately equally and therefore should not signifi-
cantly affect the calculated ORs. TKR coding in CPRD has been 
recently validated with good accuracy when compared with 
hospital admission records.34 35 Details relating to timing of ACL/
meniscal injury and TKR, as well as the specific nature of the 
injuries, would have provided useful information for subanalysis 
but within the case–control design of this study were outside the 
remit of this investigation. Another limitation is that we were 
not able to establish from the CPRD the laterality of neither the 
TKR nor ACLi for the individuals. Although this warrants some 
caution in interpreting the exact value of the calculated OR, it is 
unlikely to alter the overall conclusions as the assumption that 
the side of injury is the same as the side of TKR is an assump-
tion for both cases and controls. In a population-based study of

this magnitude with over 150 
000 individuals, the influence of 
misrepresenting laterality of injury and TKR should not signifi-
cantly change the overall OR between cases and controls.
The case–control design of the study did not allow us to 
undertake an analysis of operative/non-operative management 
of ACL and meniscal injuries, which is perhaps an important 
potential confounder. With respect to ligament reconstruction, 
two previous population-based cohort studies have addressed 
this question.36 37 A study based on records for cruciate liga-
ment reconstruction (may include posterior cruciate ligament) 
procedures reported a seven times higher incidence of TKR 
after cruciate ligament reconstruction compared with a matched 
cohort of individuals from the general population.36 Although 
an area of some debate, if it is assumed that ACL reconstruc-
tion does not protect against the risk of TKR in ACL-injured 
patients,37 the results of the present study are not dissimilar to 
those reported by Leroux et al.36 However, due to the differ-
ence in study design, direct comparisons are not possible. For 
meniscal surgery, Lohmander et al reviewed 41 studies and 
reported an overall estimated OR of 10 for radiographic knee 
OA 15–20 years after meniscectomy when compared with an 
age-matched and sex-matched group with no history of knee 
injury.2 The authors did indicate in their review that the better 
designed cohort studies reported a much higher incidence of 
radiographic OA after meniscectomy, which would equate to a 
higher OR compared with age-matched and sex-matched unin-
jured individuals.
It has been estimated that the lifetime risk of TKR for an indi-
vidual aged 50 is as high as 10.8% for women and 8.1% for 
men.20 Since ACL and meniscal injuries are increasing in inci-
dence,38 39 and given the findings of this study, it is reasonable 
to assume that a significant number of TKRs performed are the 
sequelae of these injuries. It follows that the socioeconomic 
impact of ACL and meniscal injuries is substantial in both the 
short term and long term. Mather et al40 estimated the life-
time burden of ACLi in the USA to be between $7.6 
billion and 
$17.7 
billion depending on treatment strategy. Based on the US 
model, the same study suggested 25 
000–30 000 TKRs per year 
are attributable to ACLi.40 The present study by indicating a 
strong association between ACLi and TKR supports the claim 
that ACLi contributes to the financial burden of end-stage OA 
resulting in knee arthroplasty. Therefore, strategies to prevent 
knee injury including targeted training programmes41–43 as well 
treatment methods to avoid the onset and progression of OA 
following these injuries are likely to reduce the TKR burden.
COnClusIOns
In conclusion, this study demonstrates a strong association 
between ACL and meniscal injuries and the risk of TKR. Further 
work should focus on determining whether initial treatment of 
the meniscal and ACLi has any effect in reducing the long-term 
risk of end-stage knee OA.

What are the findings?
 
► ACL injury is associated with an approximately sevenfold 
increased odds of total knee replacement for osteoarthritis.
 
► Meniscal injury is associated with an approximately 15-fold 
increased odds of total knee replacement for osteoarthritis.
how might it impact on clinical practice in the future?
 
► The ability to provide patients with a quantifiable risk of 
end-stage osteoarthritis after ACL and meniscal injuries.
 
► To compare long-term results of ACL and meniscal injury 
treatments with a baseline to ascertain if surgical therapies 
lower or increase the risk of end-stage osteoarthritis.
