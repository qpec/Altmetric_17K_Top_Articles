Abstract
Background
Bone-patellar
tendon-bone
(bone-tendon-
bone) and four-strand hamstring tendon grafts (hamstring)
are the most commonly utilized autografts for primary
anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. Existing
clinical trials, registry studies, and meta-analyses offer
conflicting opinions regarding the most favorable graft
choice.
Questions/purposes
Which graft type for ACL recon-
struction (bone-tendon-bone or hamstring) has a higher risk
of (1) graft rupture and/or (2) graft laxity?
Methods
We performed a meta-analysis of randomized
controlled trials (RCTs), prospective cohort studies, and
high-quality national registry studies to compare the out-
comes of primary ACL reconstruction with bone-tendon-
bone autograft or hamstring autograft. Studies that com-
pared
these
graft
types
were
identified
through
a
comprehensive search of electronic databases (PubMed,
MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library). Two
independent reviewers utilized the Jadad scale for RCT
study quality and the Modified Coleman Methodology
Score for prospective comparative and registry study
quality. The included studies were analyzed for the primary
outcome measure of graft rupture with or without revision
ACL surgery. In surviving grafts, secondary outcomes of
graft laxity were quantified by KT1000/2000TM testing, a
positive pivot shift test, and a positive Lachman test. Meta-
analysis was performed with Review Manager. A total of
47,613 ACL reconstructions (39,768 bone-tendon-bone
and 7845 hamstring) from 14 RCTs, 10 prospective com-
parative studies, and one high-quality national registry
study were included in this meta-analysis. Mean age was

 28 years in both groups. Sixty-three percent of patients in
the bone-tendon-bone cohort were men versus 57% of
patients in the hamstring cohort. Mean followup was 68 ±
55 months.
Results
Two hundred twelve of 7560 (2.80%) bone-ten-
don-bone grafts ruptured compared with 1123 of 39,510
(2.84%) in the hamstring group (odds ratio = 0.83, 95%
confidence interval, 0.72-0.96; p = 0.01). The number
needed to treat analysis found that 235 patients would need
to be treated with a bone-tendon-bone graft over a ham-
string
tendon
graft
to
prevent
one
graft
rupture.
Instrumented laxity analysis showed that 22% (318 of
1433) of patients in the bone-tendon-bone group had laxity
compared with 18% (869 of 4783) in the hamstring tendon
group (odds ratio = 0.86; p = 0.16). Pivot shift analysis
showed a positive pivot shift in 19% (291 of 1508) of the
bone-tendon-bone group compared with 17% (844 of 5062)
in the hamstring group (odds ratio = 0.89; p = 0.51).
Lachman testing showed a positive Lachman in 25% (71 of
280) of patients receiving bone-tendon-bone grafts com-
pared with 25% (73 of 288) in the hamstring group (odds
ratio = 0.96; p = 0.84).
Conclusions
In this meta-analysis of short- to mid-term
followup after primary ACL reconstruction, hamstring
autografts failed at a higher rate than bone-tendon-bone
autografts. However, failure rates were low in each group,
the difference observed was small, and we observed few
differences between graft types in terms of laxity. Both
graft types remain viable options for primary ACL recon-
struction, and the difference in failure rate should be one
part of a larger conversation with each individual patient
about graft selection that should also include potential
differences in donor site morbidity, complication rates, and
patient-reported outcome measures. Continued prospective
collection of patient data will be important going forward
as we attempt to further characterize the potential differ-
ences in outcomes attributable to graft selection.

Introduction
Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture is a devastating
injury that can lead to recurrent instability, chronic pain,
and degenerative changes in the knee [5–8, 42]. Arthro-
scopic
reconstruction
is
the
standard
approach,
but
controversy remains over the most favorable graft selec-
tion. The most commonly utilized autografts for ACL
reconstruction in the United States are the bone-patellar
tendon-bone (bone-tendon-bone) and the four-strand ham-
string tendon (hamstring) [13, 43]. Some authors suggest
that bone-tendon-bone autograft is the most favorable graft
choice because of faster graft incorporation [33], a higher
proportion of patients returning to preinjury activity levels
[47], and potentially a lower risk of graft rupture [32].
However, others favor hamstring autografts because of
lower donor site morbidity, anterior knee pain, extensor
strength deficit, and osteoarthritis [11, 27, 32, 39, 42].
Although controversy remains on specific advantages
and disadvantages, clearly the most significant adverse
outcome after ACL reconstruction is graft rupture and
subsequent revision surgery. There have been a number of
prospective studies that compared bone-tendon-bone and
hamstring
that
demonstrated
similar
risk
of
rupture
between the two graft types [2, 4, 21, 30, 38, 40, 41, 46]. A
2014 meta-analysis by Xie et al. [47] effectively summa-
rized the literature before 2013 with roughly 1000 patients
in each group and found no difference in the risk of graft
rupture.
In subsequent years, there have been multiple prospec-
tive studies published on this topic [3, 13, 34, 35]. The
most notable has been data on greater than 40,000 patients
from Scandinavian ACL registries, in which researchers
identified a higher risk of rupture/revision for patients
receiving hamstring than those receiving bone-tendon-bone
[15]. This finding directly contradicts what was reported by
Xie et al. in their 2014 meta-analysis [47] and thus raises
new questions about failure rate after ACL reconstruction.
It remains unclear whether there is an inherent difference in
graft type that prior studies have been underpowered to
detect or whether the difference found by Gifstad et al. [13]
is a uniquely Scandinavian phenomenon that is not gen-
eralizable to the orthopaedic community at large.
The goal of this study was to perform an up-to-date
meta-analysis, incorporating high-quality evidence from
randomized controlled trials (RCTs), prospective compar-
ative studies, and national registries in an attempt to
address the aforementioned questions. Specifically, we
asked which approach to ACL reconstruction (bone-ten-
don-bone or hamstring) has a higher risk of (1) graft
rupture and/or (2) graft laxity?
Materials and Methods
This study considered for inclusion RCTs, prospective
comparative studies, and large national registries with
prospective data collection comparing bone-tendon-bone
autograft and hamstring autograft in primary ACL recon-
struction (Table 1).
Inclusion criteria were minimum 2-year followup, doc-
umentation of graft failure rate (graft rupture or revision
ACL reconstruction), and/or documentation of measures of
graft laxity in the form of instrumented laxity (KT1000/
2000TM; MEDmetric Corp, San Diego, CA, USA), pivot

 shift test, or Lachman test among surviving grafts. Exclu-
sion criteria for studies included case reports, single-center
retrospective comparative studies, narrative reviews, or
image reviews. Studies were not excluded based on patient
demographics or surgical technique. When articles that
reported on the same patient group were identified, the
most recent data were utilized.
Search Strategy
Search engines utilized were PubMed, Cochrane Library,
MEDLINE, and EMBASE. All articles that were not in
English were excluded. Further studies were found utiliz-
ing the reference lists of the studies initially identified.
Search terms included ‘‘ACL’’ or ‘‘anterior cruciate liga-
ment’’ in combination with ‘‘hamstring autograft’’ or
‘‘semitendinosus’’ and ‘‘bone tendon bone autograft’’ or
‘‘patellar tendon’’.
After duplicates were removed, 136 abstracts were
screened. The titles and abstracts of all records retrieved by
the search were assessed independently by two authors
(BTS, NRJ). Any disagreements were resolved by discus-
sion and arbitration by the three senior authors (KEW,
TEH, AJK). After initial screening of these abstracts, two
authors (BTS, NRJ) assessed the remaining full-text arti-
cles for inclusion in the study (Fig. 1).
Studies meeting inclusion criteria were assessed for
quality by one of two methods. RCTs were assessed using
the Jadad scale [23], whereas prospective comparative
studies and registries were assessed using the Modified
Coleman Methodology Scores (MCMS) (range, 0–90) [9].
Interrater reliability was assessed with the Pearson corre-
lation coefficient. Values of correlation range from + 1
(perfect positive correlation) to -1 (perfect negative cor-
relation) with a value greater than + 0.7 considered a
strong positive correlation. This method has been utilized
in the past to assess the validity of interrater reliability
when using the MCMS in assessing the quality of articles
reviewed [18]. The mean MCMS score of the included
studies was 79 ± 5 and the median Jadad for the RCTs
included was 3 (range, 3–5) (Table 1). Blinded review of
the selected articles was conducted to ensure interrater
reliability, and a correlation coefficient of 0.79 was found
for MCMS scores and 0.89 for Jadad scores. The majority
of studies lost points from their MCMS scores as a result of
incomplete followup and the study investigators being the
surgeons who performed the operations.
Two authors (BTS, NRJ) independently extracted data
from each included study. Any discrepancies were resolved
by a third author (KEW). Patient demographics were
extracted from each study as well as the number of patients
in each study group (bone-tendon-bone versus hamstring).
Specific outcomes measured were failure rates (defined as
graft rupture or revision ACL reconstruction) in addition to
instrumented laxity (positive defined as C 3 mm), pivot
shift (positive defined as 1+ or greater), and Lachman test
(positive defined as 1+ or greater) in surviving grafts.
Fig. 1 PRISMA diagram shows
how the final studies included
were obtained. Overall, there
were 14 RCTs, 10 prospective
cohort studies, and one national
registry study.

 Outcomes Measured
There were 47,613 patients from 14 RCTs, 10 prospective
comparative studies, and one national registry included in
the meta-analysis (Table 1). Mean age for patients who
underwent ACL reconstruction with bone-tendon-bone was
28 ± 3 years versus 28 ± 4 years for those who received
hamstring autografts. Sixty-three percent of patients in the
Fig. 2 Analysis of failure rate between the studies is demonstrated. OR for graft failure was 0.83 favoring bone-tendon-bone (95% CI, 0.72-
0.96; p = 0.01). BPTB = bone-patellar-tendon bone; 4SHT = four-stranded hamstring tendon; M-H = Mantel-Haenszel.
Fig. 3 Instrumented laxity was measured by KT1000/2000TM. Positive test equals C 3-mm side-to-side difference. No major difference was
observed between either group in the study.

 studies, including 568 patients (280 bone-tendon-bone, 288
hamstring), reported Lachman test data. Fifteen studies
reported data on instrumented laxity as defined by patients
with a side-to-side difference of C 3 mm at manual max-
imum testing with KT1000/2000TM. This included 6216
patients (1433 bone-tendon-bone, 4783 hamstring). Over-
all, 13 studies reported on pivot shift testing and 6570
patients were included (1508 bone-tendon-bone, 5062
hamstring). Pivot shift was denoted as positive if patients
had a grade greater than 1+ on physical examination.
Statistical Analysis
Data analysis was performed with Review Manager (Ver-
sion 5.3; The Cochrane Collaboration, London, UK). Odds
ratio was used as summary statistics for dichotomous
variables. Odds ratios (ORs) were reported with 95%
confidence intervals, and statistical significance was set to a
p value of \ 0.05. Statistical heterogeneity between
included studies was evaluated by the I2 and chi square
tests with significance set at p\0.10. The number needed
to treat (NNT) was calculated utilizing observed relative
risks and the patient’s expected event rate [12].
Random-effects or fixed-effects models were used
depending on heterogeneity of the study. Random-effects
modeling was utilized for I2 values of [ 25% [20]. A
sensitivity analysis was performed by excluding one study
in each round and evaluating the influence of any single
study on the primary meta-analysis estimate. Subgroup
analysis was also performed based on type of study design
(RCT versus prospective cohort studies [PCS]) to identify
potential differences between bone-tendon-bone and ham-
string grafts across trials.
Publication Bias
A funnel plot was created for each outcome measure to
determine if there was bias in the studies. These plots
showed no evidence of positive outcome bias in any of the
outcomes measured and were relatively symmetric (Ap-
pendix 1 [Supplemental materials are available with the
online version of CORR1.]).
Results
The meta-analysis found that patients undergoing primary
ACL reconstruction with bone-tendon-bone autograft were
less likely to experience graft rupture and/or revision ACL
reconstruction than patients treated with hamstring auto-
graft (OR, 0.83; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.72–0.96; p
= 0.01) (Fig. 2). A NNT analysis showed that 235 patients
would need to be treated with a bone-tendon-bone graft
over a hamstring graft to prevent one graft rupture.
Among patients who did not experience graft rupture or
revision, there were no differences observed between the
two graft types in any of our secondary analyses of graft
laxity. No difference was found based on KT1000/2000TM
testing between bone-tendon-bone and hamstring (OR,
0.86; 95% CI, 0.69–1.06; p = 0.16) (Fig. 3), pivot shift
testing (OR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.63–1.25; p = 0.51) (Fig. 4), or
Lachman testing (OR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.67–1.39; p = 0.84)
(Fig. 5).
A subgroup analysis of the outcomes included in the
study was performed according to the type of study design
(PCS or RCT). The sole finding of difference was an OR of
0.76 favoring bone-tendon-bone over hamstring when
instrumented laxity in RCTs alone was analyzed (95% CI,
0.62-0.92; p = 0.006); there were no differences in terms of
Lachman or pivot shift testing (Table 2).
Discussion
Graft rupture is a feared complication after ACL recon-
struction, because revision surgery often results in inferior
patient-reported outcome measures, increased laxity with
pivot shift testing, and increased rates of tibiofemoral
arthritis [15]. Although bone-tendon-bone and hamstring
autograft are common graft choices, the available evidence
is mixed on which graft type is associated with a higher
risk of graft rupture and revision ACL reconstruction. A
recent large Scandiavian registry study [13] reported a
higher risk of graft rupture with hamstring than bone-ten-
don-bone,
but
a
prior
meta-analysis
[47]
found
no
difference between graft types. The goals of this study were
to utilize the statistical power of a meta-analysis to com-
pare the risk of graft rupture/revision and metrics of graft
laxity between graft types. We found a small increased risk
of graft rupture/revision in the hamstring group when
compared with the bone-tendon-bone group. The NNT was
calculated at 235, meaning that 235 patients would need to
be treated with bone-tendon-bone rather than hamstring to
prevent one rupture. We observed few differences between
graft types in terms of graft laxity reported by the primary
source studies.
We interpret this study in light of several limitations.
First, most of the patients included in this study came from
the Scandinavian registry studies and those results factor
heavily into the results of the current study. Although the
methodology for a registry study is not as rigorous as that
of an RCT, the data were collected longitudinally, and the
authors have published on the validity of their registry [15].
The inclusion of these data was critical to this study as we

 attempted to determine whether the results of the registry
studies would hold up in the setting of a larger meta-
analysis. Second, this study was designed to investigate
differences in the risk of graft rupture between the two
graft types without considering clinical outcome scores and
knee function. This fact keeps the study clear and focused
but precludes its use in isolation when a clinician debates
the merits of bone-tendon-bone versus hamstring autograft.
We believe that the small increased risk of graft rupture
observed in this meta-analysis should be only one aspect of
a larger discussion with patients regarding optimal graft
choice. Another limitation is that the nature of a meta-
analysis is such that the authors can only analyze and
interpret the data available in light of heterogeneous
reporting of data across studies. This fact limits the number
of patients available for analysis within the individual
outcomes studied but does not alter the validity of the
results. Lastly, the relatively short-term minimum followup
in some of the included studies prevents us from evaluation
of the long-term outcomes between graft types.
In this study, patients who received bone-tendon-bone
autograft had a reduced risk of graft failure compared with
those receiving hamstring autograft at a minimum 2-year
followup with a NNT of 235 patients. These data support
the recent findings from the Scandinavian ACL registries
[3, 13, 34, 35] and by Maletis et al. in their retrospective
registry review [29]. However, the observed difference in
this study was small and clinicians must weigh the clinical
importance of this finding while also considering differ-
ences in donor site morbidity, patient-reported outcome
metrics, and knee function scores. All of these areas rep-
resent opportunities for continued research.
Secondary outcome measures of graft laxity included
KT1000/2000TM instrumented laxity testing, pivot shift
test, and the Lachman test. Instrumented laxity testing
favored bone-tendon-bone when including RCTs in isola-
tion; however, on examination of the entire cohort, none of
these measures was found to be different between groups in
the current study. This is in contrast to the meta-analysis by
Xie et al. [47] that reported that pivot shift testing favored
bone-tendon-bone and the Cochrane review by Mohtadi
et al. [32] in which they found all three of these factors
favored bone-tendon-bone. The absence of a difference in
graft laxity between groups in this study indicates that
previously observed differences might have been the result
of sampling bias or recent improvements in surgical tech-
nique. Newer generation fixation devices for hamstring
ACL reconstruction are designed to allow for more ana-
tomic tunnel placement without compromising load to
failure [10, 17]. The routine pretensioning of hamstring
grafts also may contribute to less graft laxity regardless of
graft type [24].
In this meta-analysis of short- to mid-term followup
after primary ACL reconstruction, hamstring autografts
failed at a higher rate than bone-tendon-bone autografts.
However, failure rates were low in each group, the dif-
ference observed was small, and the grafts performed
similarly in metrics of graft laxity. Both graft types remain
viable options for primary ACL reconstruction, and the
difference in failure rate should be one part of a larger
conversation with each individual patient about graft
selection that should also include potential differences in
donor site morbidity, complication rates, and patient-re-
ported
outcome
measures.
Continued
prospective
collection of patient data will be important going forward
as we attempt to further characterize the potential differ-
ences in outcomes attributable to graft selection.
