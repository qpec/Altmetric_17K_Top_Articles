SUMMARY
Antigen presentation is essential for establishing im-
mune tolerance and for immune responses against
infectious disease and cancer. Although antigen pre-
sentation can be mediated by autophagy, here we
demonstrate a pathway for mitochondrial antigen
presentation (MitAP) that relies on the generation
and trafficking of mitochondrial-derived vesicles
(MDVs) rather than on autophagy/mitophagy. We
find that PINK1 and Parkin, two mitochondrial pro-
teins linked to Parkinson’s disease (PD), actively
inhibit MDV formation and MitAP. In absence of
PINK1 or Parkin, inflammatory conditions trigger
MitAP in immune cells, both in vitro and in vivo. MitAP
and the formation of MDVs require Rab9 and Sorting
nexin 9, whose recruitment to mitochondria is in-
hibited by Parkin. The identification of PINK1 and
Parkin as suppressors of an immune-response-elicit-
ing pathway provoked by inflammation suggests
new insights into PD pathology.
INTRODUCTION
Antigen presentation is a complex proteolytic process enabling
cells to display antigens on their surface, informing the immune
system about a cell’s physiological status. These antigens allow
T cells to distinguish normal cells from aberrant forms generated
during diseases, including a wide range of infectious diseases
and cancer (Guermonprez et al., 2002). Two classical pathways
of antigen presentation have been described for the presentation
of endogenous proteins on MHC class I molecules, and the pre-
sentation of exogenous antigens, such as intracellular patho-
gens, on MHC class II molecules (Blum et al., 2013). While the
MHC II pathway is performed by specialized cells, such as mac-
rophages and dendritic cells, virtually all cell types present pep-
tides on MHC I molecules, ensuring efficient monitoring of the
organism by the immune system. It has been shown recently
that autophagy, the recycling of self-components through
lysosomal degradation, is involved in the presentation of endog-
enous antigens on both MHC class I and class II molecules (En-
glish et al., 2009; Paludan et al., 2005), highlighting that vacuolar
content also can be presented on MHC class I molecules.
In the thymus, sampling cellular antigens through autophagy
plays a role in establishing immune tolerance (Nedjic et al.,
2008), a process essential to limiting the occurrence of autoim-
mune diseases. Thus, understanding the pathways by which
components from various organelles are sampled for presenta-
tion is of prime importance. In this context, little is known about
the mechanisms regulating the presentation of mitochondria
antigens, despite that this organelle is associated with the auto-
immune disease primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) (Hirschfield and
Gershwin, 2013). Considering the involvement of autophagy in
antigen presentation, one would assume that mitophagy, the
selective process by which mitochondria are captured for degra-
dation (Eiyama and Okamoto, 2015), would actively participate in
mitochondrial antigen presentation (MitAP). Such a process
would influence a disease like Parkinson’s disease (PD), since
mutations in genes coding for two proteins involved in mitoph-
agy, PINK1 and Parkin, are responsible for the early onset reces-
sive form of PD (Hernandez et al., 2016).
PINK1 and Parkin regulate mitophagy and reactive oxygen
species (ROS)-induced mitochondrial-derived vesicle (MDV)
transport to late endosomes (McLelland et al., 2014; Pickrell
and Youle, 2015). In this context, the current model of PD pro-
poses that defects in PINK1 and Parkin cause an accumulation
of dysfunctional mitochondria, leading to the loss of DA neurons
with age (Pickrell and Youle, 2015). Indeed, PINK1 is a kinase
stabilized at the surface of damaged mitochondria, where it
phosphorylates both ubiquitin and Parkin, promoting the recruit-
ment of mitophagy receptors (Heo et al., 2015; Lazarou et al.,
2015). However, several observations point to a significant
contribution of the immune system in the etiology of PD. These
include microglial activation, an increase in the expression of
314

 inflammatory genes, local inflammation, and infiltration of im-
mune cells in the brain of PD patients (Kannarkat et al., 2013;
Mosley et al., 2012). Recent studies have shown that DA neurons
express MHC class I molecules at their surface in the presence of
activated microglia and inflammation (Cebria
´ n et al., 2014) and
that mice lacking MHC II are protected against MPTP-induced
degeneration (Martin et al., 2016), providing further support
for the plausibility of the contribution of immune mechanisms
in the development of PD. These observations led us to investi-
gate the role of mitophagy in antigen presentation and whether
PINK1 and/or Parkin may influence this process.
Here, we present in vitro and in vivo data demonstrating that
PINK1 and Parkin play an active role in the repression of MitAP.
In the absence of these proteins, high levels of mitochondrial
antigens are presented on MHC class I molecules in both mac-
rophages and dendritic cells by a vacuolar pathway distinct
from mitophagy. Presentation of mitochondrial antigens is driven
instead by the formation of mitochondria-derived vesicles
(MDVs), a quality control mechanism allowing the shuttle of spe-
cific mitochondrial cargos to late endosomes (Sugiura et al.,
2014). We have found that both MDV formation and MitAP
require Sorting nexin 9 (Snx9), a dynamin-binding partner essen-
tial for clathrin-mediated endocytosis (Lundmark and Carlsson,
2009). The recruitment of this protein to mitochondria is actively
inhibited by Parkin. Rab9, a late endosomal/Golgi guanosine tri-
phosphatase (GTPase) that regulates vesicle release from late
endosomes (Kucera et al., 2015), is also recruited to mitochon-
dria for the formation of MDVs, while a second GTPase, Rab7,
regulates the fusion of MDVs with endosomal compartments.
These data identify an antigen presentation pathway regulated
by PINK1 and Parkin, providing a link between mitochondrial dy-
namics and the potential engagement of autoimmune mecha-
nisms in the etiology of PD.
RESULTS
A Mitochondrial Reporter Antigen Is Presented by a
Vacuolar Pathway
To test whether mitophagy is responsible for the presentation of
mitochondrial antigens, we developed a system in which the
glycoprotein B (gB) of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV1) is ex-
pressed in a murine macrophage cell line (RAW) and targeted
to the mitochondrial matrix (mito-gB). As controls, RAW cells ex-
pressing gB targeted to either the nuclear envelope (NE-gB) or
the cytoplasm (cyto-gB) (Figure 1A) were also produced. This
approach allowed us to use a gB-specific CD8+ T cell hybridoma
recognizing the gB498–505 peptide loaded on MHC class I mole-
cules to monitor antigen presentation (Mueller et al., 2002). In
steady-state conditions (37�C), the presentation of mito-gB,
unlike the other two forms of gB, was dependent on vacuolar
processing (Figure 1B). This is shown by the partial inhibition of
mito-gB presentation in cells in which the vacuolar proton
pump is inhibited with bafilomycin A (Baf) and by the increase
in cells treated with a cocktail of lysosomal proteases inhibitors
(PI), a condition that slows the complete degradation of proteins
into amino acids within endocytic compartments (English et al.,
2009). The presentation of mito-gB also distinguished itself by
being insensitive to cycloheximide treatment (Figure 1C; raw
values in Figure S1A), indicating that gB localized in the mito-
chondria matrix is presented, rather than newly synthesized
cytosolic precursor forms. To further exclude the possibility
that mito-gB mistargeted to the cytoplasm is presented, we
treated cells with IFNg to stimulate the classical proteasome
pathway of antigen presentation (Trost et al., 2009). In these
conditions, cyto-gB and NE-gB (exposed on the cytoplasmic
side of the nuclear membrane) were efficiently presented (Fig-
ure 1D) in a Baf-insensitive way (Figure 1E). As expected, treat-
ment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 strongly inhibited
presentation. In contrast, IFNg had no effect on the presentation
of mito-gB, ruling out the cytoplasm as a source of antigen. To
further demonstrate that mito-gB was processed through a
vacuolar pathway, we treated cells with a short, 45-min heat
stress (HS), a condition known to stimulate autophagy (Nivon
et al., 2009) and the vacuolar processing of endogenous proteins
(Trost et al., 2009). In these conditions, mito-gB presentation
was increased by more than 20-fold (Figure 1D; raw values in
Figure S1B). Importantly, on return to 37�C, mitochondria re-
mained fully functional with equivalent maximal respiratory rates,
no increase in ROS production, or no loss in mitochondrial mass
(Figures S1C–S1F). This ruled out a sustained toxic effect of the
HS on mitochondria. The presentation of the two other forms of
gB was also enhanced (Figure 1D) in a Baf-sensitive way
(Figure 1E).
Mitophagy Is Not Responsible for Mitochondrial Antigen
Presentation
We then examined whether the presentation pathway(s) induced
during HS were related to autophagy/mitophagy. We treated
cells with 3-methyladenine (3-MA) or downregulated the expres-
sion of ATG5 by small hairpin RNA (shRNA) (using a scramble
shRNA as control), two robust methods to inhibit autophagy
and mitophagy (Liu et al., 2012; Narendra et al., 2008). Efficiency
of knockdown (KD) was confirmed by qPCR (Table 1). These con-
ditions inhibited the presentation of NE-gB and cyto-gB during
HS, confirming the involvement of autophagy in their capture
(Figure 2A). Remarkably, mito-gB presentation was stimulated,
not inhibited, indicating that mitophagy, an ATG5-dependent
pathway (Narendra et al., 2008), is not involved in MitAP, but, in
fact, represses this process. To determine more precisely
whether mitophagy plays a role in mito-gB presentation, we
downregulated the expression of PINK1 by shRNA, a kinase
required for mitophagy (Pickrell and Youle, 2015). In these condi-
tions, mito-gB presentation was strongly enhanced (Figure 2B),
while the presentation of NE-gB and cyto-gB was not altered (Fig-
ure 2C). We were unable to generate Parkin KD cells, possibly
due to the low level of Parkin expression in RAW cells (Fig-
ure S2A). Therefore, we performed inverse experiments and
observed that a mild expression of GFP-Parkin in RAW cells abol-
ished mito-gB presentation on HS (Figure 2D), while it had no ef-
fect on the presentation of NE-gB (data not shown). These results
indicate that PINK1 and Parkin specifically regulate MitAP.
Additional experiments ruled out the contribution of mitoph-
agy in mito-gB presentation. We showed that mito-gB presenta-
tion was unaffected in cells silenced for the GTPase dynamin
related protein 1 (Drp1) (Figure 2E), a protein required for mito-
chondria fragmentation and mitophagy (Narendra et al., 2008).

 Efficiency of the Drp1 KD was confirmed by showing that
mitochondria could no longer be fragmented by protonophore
m-chlorophenylhydrazone
(CCCP)
treatment
(Figure
S2B).
Furthermore, treatment with CCCP to maximally activate mi-
tophagy had no effect on mito-gB presentation (Figure 2F). Effi-
ciency of the treatment was confirmed through the induction of
LC3 expression and degradation of mitofusin1 (Figures 2G and
S2C). Similar results were obtained in RAW cells expressing
GFP-Parkin (data not shown). These data demonstrate that mi-
tophagy provides an efficient pathway for the capture and degra-
dation of dysfunctional mitochondria in a way that limits antigen
presentation. In that respect, mitophagy differs from autophagic
pathways, such as macroautophagy (Paludan et al., 2005) and
NEDA (English et al., 2009). This might be due to the fact that
mitochondria are of bacterial origin. Because the immune sys-
tem is able to recognize and mount an efficient response against
bacteria phylogenetically related to mitochondria, it might be
beneficial to limit the exposure of mitochondrial antigens to the
immune system (Baum, 1995).
Mitochondria-Derived Vesicles Are Involved in
Mitochondrial Antigen Presentation
Having shown that mitophagy is not involved in MitAP, we per-
formed experiments to determine the nature of the Baf-sensitive
pathway responsible for mito-gB presentation during HS. We
showed previously that selective delivery of mitochondrial con-
tent to late endosomes occurs through mitochondria-derived
vesicles (MDVs) (Soubannier et al., 2012). MDVs differ from mito-
chondrial fragments through at least three distinct criteria:
(1) only selected cargo is incorporated within vesicles, (2) they
are formed in a Drp1-independent manner, and (3) ultrastructural
analysis reveals a limited diameter of 80–150 nm containing a
single outer membrane or a double membrane-bound structure
that lack cristae (Sugiura et al., 2014). With these criteria in
mind, we examined whether a PINK1/Parkin-independent MDV
pathway may be responsible for the induction of MitAP observed
during HS. Immunofluorescence analyses (IF) indicated that the
colocalized signals for mito-gB and the mitochondrial marker
Tom20 dissociated on HS, mito-gB being observed in small
vesicular-like structures lacking Tom20 throughout the cell (Fig-
ure 3A). To test whether these structures reflected membrane-
bound vesicles, we performed biochemical fractionation. In
control cells kept at 37�C, gB and Tom20 co-fractionated in
the denser parts of a sucrose gradient (Figure 3B). As observed
by IF, HS induced the dissociation of both markers, shifting a sig-
nificant part of gB to lower density fractions. HSP60, a second
matrix protein, was not shifted to light fractions on HS, support-
ing the concept that cargo-selective mechanisms operate during
MDV formation. Consistent with mito-gB being a MDV cargo, in
HS-treated cells, gB was pelleted at 110,000 3 g from a post-
mitochondrial supernatant and was soluble in the presence of
detergent (Figure 3C). Confocal images at higher magnification
revealed the lateral segregation of gB along mitochondrial tu-
bules stained for Tom20, consistent with the selective enrich-
ment of gB into vesicular structures (Figure 3D). Electron
microscopy (EM) showed the emergence of small, double mem-
brane-bound vesicular profiles (between 80–120 nm in diameter)
from mitochondria in HS conditions, while these structures were
not observed in our samples at 37�C (Figure 3D). These experi-
ments are consistent with mito-gB being a matrix cargo, selec-
tively incorporated within vesicular structures derived from
mitochondria in a Drp1-independent manner on HS treatment.
Lastly, mito-gB+/Tom20� MDVs were observed close to
LAMP1+ compartments on HS (Figure 3E), suggesting that
they might be involved in the trafficking of gB to degradative or-
ganelles for antigen processing.
Formation of MDVs and Mitochondrial Antigen
Presentation Are Regulated by Rab7, Rab9, and Snx9
Since the processing of mito-gB was vacuolar, we assumed that
MDVs interacted with late endosomes/lysosomes. This led us to
study the potential involvement of Rab7 and Rab9, two small
GTPases known to regulate the functional properties of these or-
ganelles (Chavrier et al., 1990; Lombardi et al., 1993), in MitAP.
Downregulation of either GTPase strongly inhibited mito-gB pre-
sentation, with no effect on NE-gB presentation (Figure 4A).
Specificity of the KD for Rab9 was confirmed by western blot
(WB), as well as with rescue experiments (Figures S3A and

 S3B). IF showed that while mito-gB vesicles were efficiently
generated and accumulated in the cytoplasm after HS in control
and Rab7 KD cells, the formation of these vesicles was strongly
inhibited in Rab9 KD cells (Figure 4B). On return to 37�C, mito-gB
and Tom20 co-localized together in control cells (Figure 4C). This
was not the case in Rab7 KD cells, suggesting that mito-gB ves-
icles were unable to release their content for processing in endo-
cytic organelles. These results indicate that although both
GTPases regulate the pathway of mito-gB presentation, they
act at different steps of the process. Rab7 has been shown to
be involved in membrane fusion between late endosomes and ly-
sosomes (Vanlandingham and Ceresa, 2009), suggesting that
this GTPase is either required for gB-vesicle fusion with late en-
dosomes or that GTPase inhibition interferes with late endo-
some/lysosome maturation, preventing gB processing. That
the presentation of NE-gB is not inhibited in Rab7 KD cells sup-
ports the former proposal. In contrast, the inhibition of mito-gB
vesicle formation observed in Rab9 KD cells suggests that this
small GTPase plays a role at an early step of the pathway, during
vesicle formation/budding on mitochondria. This is supported by
WB analyses showing that of the two GTPases, only Rab9 was
recruited to mitochondria on HS (Figure 4D). Mitochondria
analyzed in these experiments were devoid of major contami-
nants from endosomes or the Golgi apparatus (Figure S3C).

Since Rab9 plays a role in vesicle forma-
tion/budding of retrograde cargo from
late endosomes (Dong et al., 2013), our
data support the concept that Rab9 plays
a similar role on mitochondria. Further ex-
periments with RAW cells expressing

(Q66L)

mutants
confirmed
that
mito-gB
vesicle
formation
(data
not

GTPase activity of Rab9 (Figure 4E). EM analyses showed the
accumulation
of
small,
double
membrane-bound
vesicles
apparently unable to bud off mitochondria in Rab9 KD cells (Fig-
ure 4F), consistent with the IF results.
We also identified Snx9 as an essential component required
for MDVs formation. Snx9 was picked from a genome-wide
screen search for proteins affecting mitochondrial morphology
(Norton et al., 2014) and considered interesting for the present
study because of its established function in vesicle formation
and intracellular membrane trafficking (Lundmark and Carlsson,
2009). To determine whether Snx9 played a role in mito-gB
vesicle formation, we first tested the requirement for Snx9 in
the established MDV transport pathway induced on oxidative
stress (Soubannier et al., 2012). Confocal stacks confirmed the
localization of YFP-Snx9 on mitochondria (Figure S4). Silencing
Snx9 inhibited the formation of MDVs induced under oxidative
stress (Figure S4B). Video microscopy showed that Snx9 tran-
siently associated with mitochondria (Figure S4C), in foci that
‘‘flashed’’ on the membrane with an average duration of 24 s.
These data suggest a role for Snx9 in the generation of oxida-
tive-stress-induced MDVs. Downregulation of Snx9 in RAW cells
strongly inhibited the formation of mito-gB vesicles (Figure 5A)
and the presentation of this marker (Figure 5B). In contrast,

 Snx9 downregulation had no effect on the presentation of
NE-gB. Like Rab9, Snx9 was recruited to mitochondria during
HS (Figure 5C). EM analysis showed an accumulation of small
buds on the surface of mitochondria in both Rab9 and Snx9
KD cells (Figures 5D and 5E).
So far, our data indicate that PINK1 and Parkin selectively
inhibit MitAP and that MDV formation requires the recruitment
of Snx9 and Rab9 to mitochondria. The precise way by which
PINK1 and/or Parkin regulates this pathway is unknown. Expres-
sion of GFP-Parkin in RAW macrophages, a condition shown to
inhibit MitAP on HS (Figure 2D), inhibited the recruitment of Snx9
to mitochondria (Figure 5F). In the presence of GFP-Parkin, the
cellular pool of Snx9 was degraded on HS, as shown by its
decrease in total cell lysate (TCL). Interestingly, treatment with
MG132 to inhibit the proteasome restored the pool of protein
in the TCL and the recruitment of Snx9 to mitochondria during
HS, suggesting that the ubiquitin ligase activity of Parkin plays
a role in the degradation of Snx9. This proposal was supported
by the finding that the expression of the two mutants of GFP-
Parkin lacking E3 ligase activity (C431N and K211N) (McLelland
et al., 2014) had no significant inhibitory effect on MitAP (Fig-
ure S4D) and did not affect the level of expression of Snx9 in
the cell (TCL) or inhibit recruitment of Snx9 to mitochondria on
HS (Figure S4E).
Presentation of Mitochondrial Antigens on MHC Class I
Molecules Is Repressed by PINK1 and Parkin In Vitro and
In Vivo
Next, we tested whether PINK1 and Parkin also repress the pre-
sentation of an endogenous mitochondrial antigen. For this we
turned to PBC, a clinically relevant model of mitochondrial auto-
immune disorder associated with the presentation of a peptide
derived from the mitochondrial matrix protein 2-oxoglutarate de-
hydrogenase (OGDH) (Bjo
¨ rkland et al., 1991). Using a CD8+
T cell hybridoma specifically recognizing an OGDH epitope
loaded on MHC class I molecules (Kanaseki et al., 2006), we first
observed that HS induced the formation of OGDH+ vesicles
lacking Tom20 in RAW cells (Figure 6A). Second, presentation
of OGDH was increased in ATG-5 KD RAW cells during HS
and inhibited in cells silenced for either Rab9 or Snx9 (Figure 6B).
As observed for mito-gB, induction of mitophagy with CCCP did
not lead to the presentation of OGDH (data not shown). Third, the
transient expression of GFP-Parkin in primary bone marrow-
derived macrophages (BMDM) prompted the recruitment of
GFP-Parkin to mitochondria (TOM20+) on HS, inhibiting the for-
mation of OGDH+ vesicles (Figure 6C) and the presentation of
this antigen on MHC I molecules (Figure 6D). Similar results
were obtained for bone-marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDC;
data not shown). Fourth, we isolated BMDC from PINK1
knockout (KO) mice and showed an increase in the presentation
of OGDH on HS treatment in vitro, compared to cells isolated
from wild-type littermate animals (Figure 6E). Similar results
were obtained with BMDM (data not shown). Together, these
data demonstrate that an endogenous mitochondrial matrix
enzyme, involved in the development of the autoimmune disease
PBC, is presented on MHC class I molecules by a vesicular
pathway consistent with the one described for the model
antigen gB.
So far, we used a mild HS-mimicking fever (Hasday and Singh,
2000) to trigger MDV formation and MitAP. Inflammatory condi-
tions and exposure to LPS, a mediator of inflammation, have
been reported to reduce the level of Parkin in neurons and mac-
rophages, leading to the proposal that chronic inflammatory
conditions may phenocopy parkin loss-of-function mutations
(Tran et al., 2011). This led us to examine whether LPS affects
MitAP. As observed for HS, treatment of RAW cells with LPS
and INFg at 37�C (to mimic inflammatory conditions) induced
the formation of mito-gB+/Tom20� vesicles (Figure 6F) and
strongly stimulated gB presentation (Figure 6G). Additional HS
treatment further enhanced MitAP. The stimulatory effect of
LPS on MDVs and OGDH antigen presentation was also
observed in BMDC and BMDM (data not shown). The pathway
of mito-gB presentation induced by LPS displayed similar fea-
tures as the one described for HS. It was inhibited in Snx9 and
Rab9 KD cells, as well as in cells expressing GFP-Parkin, while
an increase was observed in PINK1 KD cells (Figure 6H). These
data show that PINK1 and Parkin also act to repress the presen-
tation of gB during LPS treatment.
In addition to the role of PINK1 and Parkin in mitophagy, our
data reveal that these proteins function in repressing MitAP in
APCs (antigen-presenting cells) in vitro. Next, we addressed
whether the proposed role for PINK1 and Parkin in limiting MitAP
could be validated in vivo. To this end, we injected a single intra-
venous dose of LPS in 2- to 3-month-old PINK1 and Parkin KO
and WT littermate control mice to determine whether this condi-
tion would induce OGDH presentation in dendritic cells (DC).
24 hr after LPS injection, we isolated CD11c+ DC by immunose-
lection using CD11c magnetic beads (Figure 6I) and co-culti-
vated them with the OGDH-specific CD8+ T cell hybridoma.
OGDH presentation did not occur in DC from mice injected
with PBS, while only a low level of presentation was detected
in DC isolated from LPS-injected control animals. In contrast, in-
jection of LPS in PINK1 and Parkin KO mice resulted in higher
levels of OGDH presentation by DC (Figure 6J). These data
confirm our in vitro findings, demonstrating a clear role for
PINK1 in the inhibition of MitAP in vivo.
DISCUSSION
Our in vitro and in vivo data highlight a pathway for the presenta-
tion of mitochondrial antigens regulated by PINK1 and Parkin.
Surprisingly, this pathway is not mediated by mitophagy, but
rather is driven by the generation of MDVs. MDVs were originally
described as MAPL-containing vesicles involved in the traf-
ficking of selective mitochondrial cargo to peroxisomes (Neu-
spiel et al., 2008). Later, a second pathway was identified that
carried oxidized cargo to the late endosome for degradation, a
process stimulated on oxidative stress. The formation of these
structures was Drp1 independent but required three of the PD-
related proteins, PINK1, Parkin (for ROS-induced transport to
late endosomes), and Vps35 (for delivery to peroxisomes) (Bra-
schi et al., 2010; McLelland et al., 2014), highlighting the potential
relevance of these structures in PD. Interestingly, Vps35 has
been recently shown to play a role in MDV transport within dopa-
minergic neurons derived from PD patients (Tang et al., 2015;
Wang et al., 2015). The mechanisms involved in the formation

 of HS/LPS-induced MDVs differ from the two types of structures
described above. Indeed, although they carry selected cargo
and are generated in a Drp1-independent manner, the formation
of HS/LPS-induced MDVs does not require PINK1 and Parkin. In
fact, these two proteins actively inhibit their biogenesis. These
results suggest that different pathways are engaged on ROS
production and in response to HS/LPS. This was confirmed by
showing that the PINK1/Parkin-dependent cargo PDH present
in ROS-induced MDVs was not incorporated in HS-induced
MDVs in COS7 cells. Concomitantly, OGDH present in HS/
LPS-induced MDVs was not transferred to ROS-induced
MDVs (Figure S5). Overall, these data highlight that mitochondria
are highly dynamic organelles. Understanding the mechanisms
of cargo incorporation and the structure/function of each
class of MDVs will provide a better understanding of the
complex mechanisms linking mitochondrial dynamic events
with diseases.
We have found that two cytoplasmic proteins, Snx9 and Rab9,
are required for HS/LPS-induced MDV formation and MitAP.
Both of these proteins are involved in trafficking events occurring
elsewhere in the cell. Snx9 is recruited to dynamin2 oligomers at
the plasma membrane, where it coordinates actin polymerization
and vesicle release (Yarar et al., 2007). Rab9 acts on late
endosomes, where it regulates the formation of retrograde trans-
port vesicles carrying Mannose-6-phosphate receptors to the
trans-Golgi network (Carroll et al., 2001). Our data indicate that
Snx9 and Rab9 accumulate on mitochondria on HS, demon-
strating that proteins involved in MDV formation are actively re-
cruited in response to stress. Our results also showed a direct
correlation between the extent of MDV formation and MitAP.
Conditions that stimulated MDV formation, such as HS and
PINK1 KD, increased MitAP, while conditions resulting in a
decrease of MDVs, such as Snx9 and Rab9 KD, decreased
MitAP.
A mechanism that may have explained how PINK1 and Parkin
inhibits MitAP is through a massive engagement of mitophagy,
sequestering mitochondria within membrane structures and pre-
venting the release of MDVs. This pathway was ruled out since
no change in mitochondrial function or mass was observed after
HS. Instead, the observations that gB- and OGDH-containing
vesicles are rapidly released after HS (within the first 30 min),
while MitAP occurs within 2 hr, suggests that PINK1 and Parkin
rapidly repress MDV formation in response to HS/LPS stimula-
tion. Our data suggest that Parkin controls MDV formation and
MitAP by regulating the level of the cellular pool of Snx9 in a pro-
teasome-dependent manner. In cells expressing GFP-Parkin,
HS induces a rapid degradation of Snx9, preventing the recruit-
ment of this protein to mitochondria. In this context, expression
of a catalytically dead form of GFP-Parkin did not prevent MDV
formation and MitAP. Whether Snx9 is a direct or indirect sub-
strate of Parkin is not yet known, although the stability of Snx9
during HS is dependent on Parkin’s enzymatic activity. Interest-
ingly, the association of Rab9 with mitochondria in heart tissue of
OVE26 diabetic mice has been shown to occur in conditions in
which mitophagy is inhibited and the level of PINK1 and Parkin
expression is strongly decreased (Xu et al., 2013). These results
suggest that Parkin-dependent mechanisms similar to those
described here may also regulate the recruitment of cytoplasmic
proteins to mitochondria in association with the cardiac dysfunc-
tion observed in these animals.
The finding that embryonic fibroblasts present OGDH after HS
or LPS/IFNg treatment (Figure S6A) suggests that cell types
other than immune cells are able to perform MitAP and may
thus be affected by PINK/Parkin mutations. After MDV forma-
tion, a second GTPase, Rab7, is required for MitAP, probably
for fusion of the vesicles with late endosomes (as shown by the
accumulation of vesicles in Rab7 KD cells). In late endosomes/ly-
sosomes, mitochondrial antigens are processed by hydrolytic
enzymes, as shown by the increase in presentation when cells
are treated with protease inhibitors. Peptides are then likely to
be translocated to the cytoplasm to be further processed by
the proteasome, before loading on MHC I molecules in the ER,
as suggested for cross-presentation (Houde et al., 2003).
Expression of GFP-Parkin in RAW cells had no effect on the pre-
sentation of exogenous gB internalized by phagocytosis (inacti-
vated HSV1 particles coated on latex beads) (English et al.,
2009), ruling out the contribution of Parkin in regulating cross-
presentation at common steps downstream of MDV transport
to the late endosome (Figure S6B). Interesting aspects not
been addressed in our study include the nature of the mitochon-
drial proteins, other than OGDH, processed and presented
through the PINK1/Parkin-controlled MDV pathway, and the po-
tential presentation of mitochondrial antigens on MHC class II
molecules.
Inflammation and microglial activation in the brain of PD pa-
tients has led to the proposal that non-autonomous cell pro-
cesses involving the immune system contribute to DA neuron
degeneration (Dawson, 2008). Our data provide support for a
non-cell-autonomous model in which autoimmune mechanisms
mediated by cytotoxic T cell activity contribute to the destruction
of DA neurons during PD. We argue that in addition to the role of
PINK1/Parkin in mitochondrial quality control, the loss of their
activity during PD would increase MitAP on cellular stress,
such as inflammation. This is supported by our in vivo results
in Parkin and PINK1 KO mice showing that a single injection of
LPS is sufficient to induce MitAP in dendritic cells. Interestingly,
LPS treatment was shown to induce subtle fine-motor deficits
and selective loss of DA neurons in the substantia nigra of
Parkin �/�mice (Frank-Cannon et al., 2008). MitAP increase in
APCs is likely to promote the establishment of peripheral mito-
chondrial antigen-specific T cell populations. In this context,
neuroinflammation and microglia activation at a later age within
PD patients would allow T cells to access the brain (Mosley
et al., 2012). It is known that during infectious or inflammatory
(E) Mito-gB presentation was inhibited in cells expressing the S21N mutant of Rab9 (GDP bound) and stimulated when the Q66L mutant (GTP bound) was
expressed.

 conditions, peripheral immune cells access the CNS (Mosley
et al., 2012). Blood-brain barrier dysfunctions have been re-
ported in PD patients (Kortekaas et al., 2005; Pisani et al.,
2012). Furthermore, a recent study has revealed the existence
of a lymphatic system in the CNS that may facilitate the transport
of immune cells (Louveau et al., 2015). Thus, mechanisms exist

 to allow T cell infiltration and direct access to DA neurons.
Remarkably, DA neurons were shown to express MHC class I
molecules at their surface in presence of activated microglia or
other stressors linked to inflammation, becoming ‘‘visible’’ to
the immune system (Cebria
´ n et al., 2014). In this context, our
data provide a mechanism whereby activation of MitAP in
Parkin �/� DA neurons would engage recognition by estab-
lished mitochondria antigen-specific T cells, triggering a cyto-
toxic response that may ultimately lead to neuron cell death.
Our work provides a new conceptual framework for future inves-
tigation into the contribution of MitAP within both DA neurons
and immune cells in PD.
Lastly, the identification of the cell biological pathway respon-
sible for MitAP also provides a mechanistic basis for the under-
standing
of
mitochondrial
immune
tolerance
and
related
autoimmune disease. For example, our data demonstrate that
the MDV-driven MitAP pathway is used to process and present
OGDH on MHC class I molecules. OGDH is the source of the
main autoantigen associated with the autoimmune disease
PBC, where the contribution of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell
response has been demonstrated (Hirschfield and Gershwin,
2013). Autoimmunity is controlled by a fine balance between
tolerance and the deleterious effect of an active immune
response. This control is done in part by regulatory T cells
(Tregs), which are major actors of peripheral tolerance. Adoptive
transfer of Tregs has been shown to be a successful approach
for the treatment of autoimmune cholangitis, a mouse model of
PBC (Tanaka et al., 2014). Remarkably, Tregs also have been
shown to exert a neuroprotective effect on the nigrostrial system
on adoptive transfer in MPTP-intoxicated mice, an animal model
of PD (Olson and Gendelman, 2016; Reynolds et al., 2007). In PD
patients, alteration in peripheral T lymphocyte populations, with
an increase in CD8+ T cells and a decrease in Tregs, has been
reported (Baba et al., 2005), supporting the potential involve-
ment of autoimmune mechanisms in the progression of the dis-
ease. Overall, identification of PINK1 and Parkin as regulators of
the immune system opens novel avenues for the development of
effective treatments against PD.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Animals and Cells
BALB/c, C57BL/6, Pink1 �/�, and Parkin �/� mice were handled in strict
accordance with good animal practice as defined by the Canadian Council
on Animal care and protocols approved by the Comite
´ de de
´ ontologie animale
of Universite
´ de Montre
´ al. The RAW 264.7 macrophage cell line (ATCC), the
H-2Kb RAW cell line (Bell et al., 2013), and COS7 cells (ATCC) were cultured
in DMEM (10% [v/v] fetal calf serum [FCS], penicillin [100 units/ml], and strep-
tomycin [100 mg/ml]). The b-galactosidase-inducible HSV gB/Kb-restricted
HSV-2.3.2E2 CD8+ T cell hybridoma (2E2) was kindly provided by F. Carbone
(University of Melbourne). The OGDH/Ld and OGDH/Kb-restricted 2CZ CD8T+
cell hybridoma (Dutz et al., 1994; Udaka et al., 1993) was kindly provided by
N. Shastri (University of California). Hybridomas were maintained in RPMI-
1640 medium supplemented with 5% (v/v) FCS, glutamine (2 mM), penicillin
(100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 mg/ml).
Immunofluorescence and Electron Microscopy
For IF microscopy, cells were fixed 15 min (37�C) with 5% paraformaldehyde
(PFA). PFA was then quenched with 50 mM NH4Cl/PBS for 10 min at room
temperature (RT). Cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X- 100/PBS
(v/v) for 10 min at RT and blocked with 5% FBS/PBS for 10 min. Cells were
incubated with primary antibodies for 2 hr. After the several PBS washes, cells
were incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 hr and observed with a Andor/
Yokogawa spinning disk confocal system (CSU-X) attached to a Olympus IX81
inverted microscope and 1003 or 603 objectives (na 1.4). For the quantifica-
tion of gB+ MDVs, images stacks (0.4-mm steps) were analyzed by ImageJ.
Quantification was done on at least three experiments (10–15 cells/experi-
ment). Mander’s colocalization coefficient was measured using the JACoP
plugin from ImageJ. For electron microscopy, cells were fixed in 2.5% (v/v)
glutaraldehyde at 37�C for 45 min and embedded in Epon (Mecalab). Quanti-
fication of mitochondrial buds was performed on randomly selected cell pro-
files (in each experiment, at least 12 cell profiles per condition).

was loaded onto a 0.5–1.8 M sucrose gradient and centrifuged at 80,000 3 g
for 18 hr. Fractions were collected and analyzed by western blotting. Mito-
chondria were purified using a mitochondria isolation kit (Miltenyi). In order
to isolate vesicular structures containing mito-gB, the negative fraction after
immunoselection was subjected to a second centrifugation (15,000 3 g,
15 min) to eliminate remaining mitochondria. The supernatant was collected
and subjected to a third centrifugation (110,000 3 g, 45 min) to enrich smaller
vesicular structures. As a control, 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma) was added to sol-
ubilize membrane-bound structures before the third centrifugation. Proteins
were separated on 4%–15% pre-cast SDS-PAGE (BioRad) and processed
for immunodetection by chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences).
MHC Class I Antigen Presentation Assay
2 3 105 APC were plated in triplicate and treated or not with a 45-min HS at
42�C and then returned to 37�C for a total time of 2, 4, 6, and 8 hr. Alternatively,
cells were pre-incubated with LPS+IFNg before HS. Cells were then fixed with
1% PFA for 10 min at RT and washed with RPMI, 10% FBS, and 0.1 M glycine.
Finally 105 2E2 T cells were added for 16 hr, and b-galactosidase activity was
measured at 595 nm after the addition of CPRG substrate. For OGDH antigen
presentation using H2-Ld-expressing cells (Raw- and BALB/c-derived cells),
2CZ T cell hybridoma was used, and IL-2 secretion was measured using
IL-2 ELISA (eBiosciences). As the 2CZ TCR affinity for the OGDH/Kb complex
is much lower than the affinity for the OGDH/Ld complex (Dutz et al., 1994), we
used an IL-2 ELISPOT assay (Mabtech) to measure OGDH antigen presenta-
tion by H2-Kb-expressing cells (C57BL/6 and Pink1 �/� derived cells).
In Vivo LPS Administration
6- to 12-week-old WT and Pink1 and Parkin KO mice were injected intrave-
nously (i.v.) with 10 mg of liposaccharide (LPS). Mice were sacrificed 20 hr later,
and CD11c+ DC were purified from spleen and lymph nodes using a pan-den-
dritic cells isolation kit (Miltenyi), followed by a positive selection using CD11c
magnetic beads (Miltenyi). DC purity and activation level was assessed by fluo-
rescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) (BD FACS Canto II). OGDH antigen
(G) LPS+IFNg pre-treatment promotes OGDH antigen presentation.
(H) OGDH presentation is inhibited in the absence of Snx9 and Rab9, as well as when GFP-Parkin is expressed, while the absence of PINK1 promotes it.
(I) Splenic CD11c+ dendritic cells (DC) were isolated after i.v. administration of LPS to PINK1 and Parkin (data not shown) KO mice.
(J) LPS stimulation in vivo increases the presentation of OGDH in DC from PINK1 and Parkin KO mice. Data represent mean ± SD of one experiment, repre-
sentative of at least three independent experiments. The p value is calculated using one-way (H and J) and two-way (B) ANOVA analyses or the Student’s t test
(D and E).

 presentation by CD11c+ DC was measured using 2CZ hybridoma and IL-2
ELSIPOT.
Statistical Analyses
p values were calculated using Prism (GraphPad). Differences between the
two groups were tested with a Student’s t test, and the differences between
three or more groups were tested by one-way or two-way ANOVA. Quantifica-
tion of western blots was performed using ImageJ.
