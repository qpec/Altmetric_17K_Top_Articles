In a closed population and defined time period, the mean number of opposite-sex partners reported by
men and women should be equal. However, in all surveys, men report more partners. This incon-
sistency is pivotal to debate about the reliability of self-reported sexual behavior. We used data from the
third National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles (Natsal-3), a probability sample survey of the
British population, to investigate the extent to which survey sampling, accounting strategies (e.g.,
estimating versus counting), and (mis)reporting due to social norms might explain the inconsistency.
Men reported a mean of 14.14 lifetime partners; women reported 7.12. The gendergap of 7.02 reduced
to 5.47 after capping the lifetime partner number at the 99th percentile. In addition, adjusting for
counting versus estimation reduced the gender gap to 3.24, and further adjusting for sexual attitudes
narrowed it to 2.63. Together, these may account for almost two-thirds of the gender disparity.
Sampling explanations (e.g., non-U.K.-resident partners included in counts; sex workers underrepre-
sented) had modest effects. The findings underscore the need for survey methods that facilitate candid
reporting and suggest that approaches to encourage counting rather than estimating may be helpful.
This study is novel in interrogating a range of potential explanations within the same nationally
representative data set.
Accurate reporting of sexual partners is crucial to a wide range of
sexuality research, including measuring trends in sexual beha-
vior assessing individual risk of sexually transmitted infections
(STIs) and estimating the rate and modeling the impact of STI/
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission in a
population.
In a relatively closed population, the mean number of
opposite-sex partners per unit of time reported by men
should be similar to that of women, particularly over short
time periods (Wadsworth, Johnson, Wellings, & Field,
1996). Although the gap has narrowed over recent decades,
surveys across the world find that men typically report about
twice as many lifetime partners as women (Mercer et al.,
2013; Todd et al., 2009). This inconsistency has long vexed
researchers and has underpinned concerns about the veracity

 of self-reported sexual behavior in general. The discrepancy
also provides a key exemplar to investigate (albeit indir-
ectly) validity and bias in surveys of sexual behavior.
There are three approaches to explaining the gap. The first
focuses on sampling explanations, such as underrepresentation
of sex workers, age mixing, and inclusion of partners who are
nonresident in the population (Wadsworth et al., 1996). Such
explanations derive from statistical adjustment to investigate
hypothesized sampling bias. Brewer and colleagues (2000),
for example, suggested that the gender discrepancy could be
eliminated by adjusting for underrepresentation of sex workers
in population surveys.
The second explanation focuses on gender differences in
accounting strategies and recall, observing that less accurate
estimation strategies are associated with higher numbers
(Bogart et al., 2007). A female tendency to enumerate (count
instances) leads to lower estimates, while a male tendency to
approximate (Brown & Sinclair, 1999) and to report large round
numbers (Wiederman, 1997) leads to overestimates. A small
literature has also focused on what is counted and on gendered
differences in how sexual partners are defined (Jeannin,
Konings, Dubois-Arber, Landert, & Van Melle, 1998; Sanders
& Reinisch, 1999), suggesting a higher propensity among men
to include nonpenetrative sex partners in their total count.
The third explanation focuses on misreporting due to inten-
tional or unintentional “false accommodation” to perceived
gendered norms and expectations (Fisher, 2013; Jonason &
Fisher, 2009). Fear of social disapproval for transgressing
gender norms may lead men to overreport and women to
underreport their lifetime partners (Alexander & Fisher,
2003). Experimental manipulation of survey conditions sug-
gests the gender discrepancy is narrower when participants
perceive greater privacy (e.g., in self-complete versus inter-
viewer-administered surveys; Tourangeau & Smith, 1996) and
also when they think that lying might be detected (Alexander
& Fisher, 2003). Overheard (staged) conversations expressing
conservative or permissive norms (Fisher, 2009), as well as the
gender of the researcher (Fisher, 2007), have also been shown
to affect reporting, particularly among men and women who
adhere more strongly to gender stereotypes.
All three explanatory approaches are credible and have
some empirical support, so it seems reasonable to conclude
that they could all play a potential role in accounting for the
gender discrepancy. Currently, we do not know which
explanation is primary, because the empirical data typically
derive from small and/or unrepresentative studies that can-
not be directly compared. Understanding the relative con-
tribution
of
these
competing
explanations
requires
concurrent comparison within the same data set. Brown,
Schweickart, Sinclair, and Moore (2017) recently consid-
ered accounting and social desirability explanations within
the same large data sets, but to our knowledge, our study is
the first attempt to compare all three types of explanation
simultaneously. We used data from the third National
Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles (Natsal-3) to
investigate all three types of explanation: (a) sampling, (b)
accounting strategies, and (c) conformity to gendered
norms. We focused on lifetime as the period in which the
largest gender discrepancy emerges and in which issues of
recall bias and accounting strategies are most pertinent.
Method
Participants and Procedure
We present data from Natsal-3, a stratified probability
sample survey of 15,162 men and women aged 16 to
74 years in Britain, interviewed between September 2010
and August 2012 (http://www.natsal.ac.uk). We used a mul-
tistage, clustered, and stratified probability sample design.
We weighted the data to adjust for unequal selection prob-
abilities and poststratified the sample to match the 2011
census by age, sex, and region (Mercer et al., 2013).
Participants were interviewed at home, by a trained inter-
viewer, using computer-assisted face-to-face interviews and
computer-assisted self-interviews (CASIs) for the more sen-
sitive questions (Mercer et al., 2013).
The response rate was 57.7% (of all addresses known or
estimated to be eligible). Details of the survey methodology are
published elsewhere (http://www.natsal.ac.uk; Mercer et al.,
2013). Natsal-3 was approved by Oxfordshire Research Ethics
Committee A. Participants provided oral informed consent for
interviews.
Measures
Survey measures and time frames are shown in Box 1.
Analysis
We included all participants (men [unweighted, weighted]:
6,023, 7,170; women [unweighted, weighted]: 8,530, 7,323)
except those with missing number of partners (< 5%).
Participants were included regardless of sexual orientation,
because individuals identifying as gay or lesbian may also report
at least one opposite-sex partner. As long as men and women
with no opposite-sex partners are included in the count, the total
number of partnerships (and therefore the mean number of
lifetime partners) should be equal, regardless of how people
identify.
Using data from Natsal-3 (including previously pub-
lished data), and grouping by explanatory approach, we
present the logic for each inclusion/exclusion or adjust-
ment to the data. We present estimates of the difference in
mean number of partners between men and women after
applying each exclusion to demonstrate its impact, and
use linear regression including adjustment factors as cov-
ariates to demonstrate the impact of adjustments. The use
of three different time periods (past year, past five years,
lifetime) reflects the reporting periods used in the survey
(Box 1).

Self-Report and Face-to-Face Measures From Natsal-3 Used in Analysis
CASI (Self-Report) Measures
Response Options (and Recoding)
CASI: Lifetime time frame
“Altogether, in your life so far, how many (women/men) have you had sexual
intercourse with (vaginal, oral, or anal)?”
Note: Question asked of all women and men regardless of sexual orientation.
Analysis includes individuals reporting 0 partners.
Number keyed in.
Note: Values capped at the 99th percentile (110 for men, 50 for women) in the
analysis, i.e., those in excess replaced by the 99th percentile.
Participants reporting five or more lifetime partners:
“Which of these best describes how you worked out that answer?”
Response options:
1. I just knew the number.
2. I remembered each partner and counted them up.
3. I estimated or guessed the number.
4. I remembered some partners and then added on an estimated number for
others.
Options 1 and 2 are categorized as counting strategies. Options 3 and 4 are
categorized as estimating strategies.
Note: Analysis showed that, among both men and women, participants who
said that they had “remembered some” reported a similar mean number of
partners as those who said that they had “estimated or guessed.” In analysis,
participants reporting less than five lifetime partners were assumed to have
counted, not estimated.
“In your lifetime, how many different (men/women [opposite sex]) have you
paid money for sex?”
Number keyed in.
CASI: Last five years time frame
“Altogether, in the last five years, how many (women/men) have you had
sexual intercourse with?”
Number keyed in.
“In the last 5 years, have you had sex for the first time, here in the U.K., with
anyone who normally lives outside the U.K.?”
Include anyone who was visiting the U.K. or living here for a while.
If yes: “In the last five years, how many people who normally live outside the
U.K. did you have sex with for the first time in the U.K.?”
Yes/no.
Number keyed in.
“In the last five years, have you had sex with anyone for the first time while
you were in any country outside the U.K.?”
If yes: “In the last five years, how many people did you have sex with for the
first time while you were in any country outside the UK?”
Yes/no.
Number keyed in.
Note on analysis: New partners abroad who were U.K. residents were
excluded (37%). Among participants reporting new sexual partners from
multiple countries while abroad, it was not possible to identify which were
U.K. residents, and all these partners were excluded.
CASI: Last year time frame
“Altogether, in the last year, how many (women/men) have you had sexual
intercourse with?”
Number keyed in.
“Were there any (women/men) you had only oral sex with and never vaginal
(or anal) sex?”
If yes: “How many different (women/men) in the last year did you have only
oral sex with and never vaginal (or anal) sex?”
“Previously, you said you had sex with (previous answer inserted) (woman/
women/man/men) in the last year. Does this number include the (woman/
women/man/men) you had only oral sex with?”
Yes/no.
Number keyed in.
Response options:
1. Yes, (all/both) included.
2. No, did not include (all of them/both of them).
Face-to-face measures
“Tell me what your views are about the following sexual relationships:”
“A married person having sexual relations with someone other than his or her
partner?”
“And what is your opinion about a person having one-night stands?”
Response options on a card provided to participants:
1. Always wrong
2. Mostly wrong
3. Sometimes wrong
4. Rarely wrong
5. Not wrong at all
“Depends/Don’t know” not given on card but recorded by interviewer if
participant gives this response.
Note: So as not to exclude participants, individuals reporting Depends/Don’t
know (269 for the first attitude and 641 for the second) were recoded to the
middle option on the Likert scale (Sometimes wrong).
WHY DO MEN REPORT MORE SEXUAL PARTNERS THAN WOMEN?
 report having had new partners while abroad in the five years
prior to interview (8.3% of men versus 4.5% of women).
Paid-for partners.
In Natsal-3, 10.8% of men reported
ever having paid for opposite-sex sex, compared with 0.1% of
women (M [SD], number of paid partners reported by men was
5.94 [12.66]; among women [n = 10], 11.41 [30.14]). Among
these participants, 35.2% of men and 63.1% of (the 10) women
reported that they had excluded these paid partners from their
total number of lifetime partners. It has been suggested that
full-time
sex
workers
are
underrepresented
in
national
surveys (Brewer et al., 2000). Around 26 sex workers would
be expected in the sample of 8,530 women, but Natsal-3 did not
ask women whether they had been paid for sex.1
Accounting Explanations
Capping extreme values.
Previous research suggests
that men report extreme numbers of lifetime partners more
often than women do (Jeannin et al., 1998). In Natsal-3, the
99th percentile was 110 partners for men but only 50 for
women.
Accounting strategy.
In Natsal-3, a higher proportion
of men than women reported that they had estimated their
lifetime number; among those reporting five to nine
partners, 24.1% of men estimated, compared with 15.0%
of women; while among those reporting 10 or more
partners, 63.1% of men said they estimated, compared
with 52.1% of women. Consistent with previous research
(Tourangeau
&
Smith,
1996),
the
use
of
estimation
strategies is evident in a tendency to report partner
numbers ending in 0 and 5, particularly with higher
numbers of partners (Figure 1). Furthermore, accounting
strategy was associated with the number of partners
reported. Men who said they had counted reported a mean
of 6.7 partners (6.3 to 7.1), while those who estimated
reported a mean of 33.7 (26.7 to 40.6). Equivalent means
for women were 4.5 (4.4 to 4.7) and 21.9 (16.9 to 26.9).
Gendered difference in what counts as a partner.
In
Natsal-3, men were more likely than women to exclude
oral-sex-only partners in their total number of partners
(33.1% of men versus 23.4% of women). At the same
time, a significantly larger proportion of men than women
reported having had oral-sex-only partners in the past year
(10.2% of men versus 6.8% of women).
Conformity to Gendered Norms
Sexual attitudes.
Natsal-3 has previously reported that
women express significantly more conservative attitudes
toward casual sex and nonexclusive sex (Mercer et al.,
2013). Women were less likely to view one-night stands
as Not wrong at all (9.3% versus 17.5%) and they were
more likely to view a “married person having sexual
relations with someone other than his or her partner” as
Always wrong (65.0% versus 57.2%) (Mercer et al., 2013).
Both attitudes were significantly associated with reporting
of sexual partners (p < 0.00001). For example, 36.6% of
men and 23.8% of women reporting five or more partners in
the past year considered casual sex as Not wrong at all,
compared with 15.0% of men and 8.8% of women who
reported just one partner during this time.
Impact of Inclusions/Exclusions and Adjustments on the
Difference in Mean Numbers of Partners Reported by
Men and Women
Table 1 shows the gender difference in mean number of
reported partners over three time periods and the impact of
including/excluding participants based on factors hypothe-
sized to affect the reported means.
Over the past year, men reported an average of 1.27
partners and women 1.04, with a difference in means of
0.23 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.14 to 0.32). Over a
five-year period, the mean number of partners reported by
men was 2.66, compared with 1.84 for women, and the
difference increased to 0.82 (95% CI: 0.55 to 1.09). Over
the lifetime period, this difference increased substantially to
7.02 (4.97 to 9.08), with men reporting a mean of 14.14
lifetime partners and women 7.12.
To examine the impact of the gendered difference in
understanding of what “counts” as a sexual partner, we
added to the one-year count any oral-sex-only partners that
had not been included in the count of sexual partners in the
past year. This led to a small increase in the difference in
mean number of partners in the past year between men and
women, from 0.23 to 0.28. Excluding new partners where
sex first occurred abroad (and where the partner was not a
U.K. resident), and new partners from outside the United
Kingdom but while in United Kingdom, caused a modest
reduction in the difference for the past five years—from
0.82 to 0.67.
Over the lifetime, the gender gap of 7.02 reduced to 5.47
after capping partner number at the 99th percentile for each
sex-specific distribution. Excluding the number of paid-for
partners resulted in a further small reduction to 5.11.
Adjusting for counting strategy (having already capped
at 99th percentile) reduced the gender gap in mean partner
number from 5.47 to 3.24. Additionally adjusting for sexual
attitudes further narrowed the gap to 2.63. In total, these
three factors accounted for a mean difference of 4.39 life-
time partners (63% of the gender disparity).

(Office for National Statistics; https://www.ons.gov.uk/).
MITCHELL, MERCER, PRAH, CLIFTON, TANTON, WELLINGS, AND COPAS
 Differences in Reported Lifetime Partners by Age
Figure 2 shows the mean number of reported lifetime
partners (and differences between means) by age group. In
the youngest age group (16–24), the mean difference is 1.3,
increasing steadily to 14 in the 55 to 64 age group and
decreasing again to 5.8 in the oldest age group (65 to 73).
Discussion
Our analysis of nationally representative data suggests that
almost two-thirds of the gender gap in number of lifetime
partners reported by men and women in Britain may be
explained by three factors: a greater propensity among men
to report extreme values; a greater propensity among women
to count rather than estimate their lifetime partners; and gen-
dered differences in attitudes toward casual and nonexclusive
sex. The disparity seems barely affected by gender differences
in the reported number of lifetime paid-for partners, but
gender differences in reported non-U.K.-resident sexual part-
ners have a modest (nonsignificant) impact in a five-year
period and cannot be discounted as a potential explanation
over the lifetime. Men were more likely than women to
exclude oral-sex-only partners from their total count, and so
adding them back in led to a slight (nonsignificant) widening
of the gap.
The gender discrepancy is biggest over the lifetime per-
iod, both relative to the means and in absolute terms; in
other words, errors appear to amplify over long time periods
rather than gradually accumulate in proportion to time.
Longer recall allows time for reevaluation of sexual his-
tories in light of attitudes and experiences; and the larger the
number, the harder it is to count. Given this, the increase in
the gender gap by age group (Figure 2) is not surprising,
because older participants have a larger number of years in
which to accrue partners and have to recall the number over
a longer period of time (age effects). Changes over time
(period effects) may also provide an explanation, if over
time it has become less “socially undesirable” for men to
report few partners and for women to report many partners.
The fact that the gender gap has narrowed in recent decades
supports this hypothesis. In Figure 2, it is striking that the
male mean increases by age group but the female mean does
not. Figure 2 also shows that the gender discrepancy is
largely
driven
by
individuals
in
older
age
groups.
However, it cannot shed light on whether differences are
real or artifactual.
A key strength of this analysis is the large representative
sample. Most studies of reporting bias in sexual behavior
are limited to college students (Alexander & Fisher, 2003;
Fisher, 2013; Jonason & Fisher, 2009) or high-risk popula-
tions (Brewer et al., 2000), and inherent sampling bias may
mask or accentuate gender differences. Others manipulate
reporting in laboratory conditions, which may not reflect
how people respond in a real-life survey (e.g., Fisher, 2013).
We were also able to consider a wide range of candidate
explanations within the same data set, albeit not all over the
lifetime period. A key limitation is that our analysis relied
on assumptions, not all of which are testable. For instance,

WHY DO MEN REPORT MORE SEXUAL PARTNERS THAN WOMEN?
 we capped extreme high values on the assumption that these
overreported partners, but we were not able to test whether
low values were underreports. Previous studies suggest that
women increase their reported number of partners more than
men when they think they are attached to a lie detector
(Fisher, 2013), and studies of survey mode show that
women increase their estimates of lifetime partners with
Web versus telephone surveys, whereas men’s estimates
stay constant (Brown et al., 2017). Similarly, we assumed
that counting strategy and sexual attitudes influence the
reported number of partners, when reverse causality (and
bidirectionality) is also plausible. However, the noted (and
other) studies that show how reporting is affected by manip-
ulating survey conditions (Brown et al., 2017; Fisher, 2009,
2013) lend some support for this causal direction, instead of,
or as well as, the other way around. Qualitative studies lend
further support; in development work for the Natsal-2 sur-
vey, several participants described how they omitted certain
partners from their total count due to shame or embarrass-
ment (Mitchell et al., 2007).

MITCHELL, MERCER, PRAH, CLIFTON, TANTON, WELLINGS, AND COPAS
 Our finding that 99th percentile capping reduces the gender
gap is consistent with previous research suggesting that the
discrepancy is due in large part to the upper tail of the distribu-
tion (Morris, 1993). We also confirm other studies in finding that
women were more likely to count and men to estimate, and that
these differences in accounting strategies also explain some of
the gender difference in mean number of partners (Brown et al.,
2017; Brown & Sinclair, 1999). Previous studies suggest that
part of the explanation may lie in a male propensity to include
oral-sex-only partners (Jeannin et al., 1998), yet we found the
reverse in our case (a male propensity to exclude these partners).
This may be due to differences in the context and phrasing of
questions to participants or, alternatively, differences in gen-
dered definitions of sex across populations and cultures. We
were not able to investigate all potential sampling explanations.
Nonparticipation in the survey may provide a partial explana-
tion, if this is related to sexual behavior differentially by gender.
Paid-for partners may also have been underreported, but the
effect of their exclusion was so small that this is unlikely to be a
major explanation, even allowing for underreporting. Brewer
and colleagues (2000) suggested that underrepresentation of
female sex workers fully accounts for the discrepancy, but
their estimate of sex-worker partners was derived from a high-
risk nonprobability sample, and they appeared to assume all
partners reported by sex workers were new clients; thus, they
may have overestimated. We did not investigate the effect of age
mixing because this element has previously been shown to be
very small (Wadsworth et al., 1996), and there are unlikely to be
significant numbers of reported partners outside of the ages 16
to 74 survey age range. The exclusions and adjustments we
made to the estimates of lifetime partners still left 37% of the
mean difference unexplained. It seems likely that explanations
we were unable to test in the lifetime period—particularly non-
U.K.-resident partners—might account for some of this differ-
ence. Our attitude measures were also rather limited proxies for
false accommodation to gender norms and may have under-
estimated the magnitude of this explanation.
The fact that the gender gap in reported lifetime partners
has narrowed over time potentially reflects greater accuracy in
the reporting of sexual behavior in general, due to improved
survey methodology and changes in social attitudes that are
more gender equal and tolerant of diversity (Copas et al.,
2002). Indeed, statistical comparisons across surveys suggest
that measurement error in reporting lifetime partners may be
no more than for other less sensitive survey measures
(Hamilton & Morris, 2010). It is also worth noting that gender
differences are small for recent, shorter time periods, and these
are the periods commonly used in understanding STI risk and
modeling transmission. Our data suggest there may be a
residual effect of adherence to conservative sexual attitudes
and that a male tendency to report extreme values and to
estimate rather than count could be key explanations for the
gender disparity in reported lifetime partners.
Privacy, confidentiality, and nonjudgmental wording are
key to minimizing bias (Catania, Gibson, Marin, Coates, &
Greenblatt, 1990; Kreuter, Presser, & Tourangeau, 2008).
Survey instructions to encourage counting rather than esti-
mating values, as well as a verification prompt for extreme
value reports, could possibly improve results, but these
changes would need to be weighed against the need to
ensure ease of completion for participants and to avoid
implying disbelief or judgment of answer.
