Abstract
Aims/hypothesis Current evidence suggests that type 2 diabetes may have a greater impact on those with earlier diagnosis (longer
duration of disease), but data are limited. We examined the effect of age at diagnosis of type 2 diabetes on the risk of all-cause and
cause-specific mortality over 15 years.
Methods The data of 743,709 Australians with type 2 diabetes who were registered on the National Diabetes Services Scheme
(NDSS) between 1997 and 2011 were examined. Mortality data were derived by linking the NDSS to the National Death Index.
All-cause mortality and mortality due to cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer and all other causes were identified. Poisson
regression was used to model mortality rates by sex, current age, age at diagnosis, diabetes duration and calendar time.
Results The median age at registration on the NDSS was 60.2 years (interquartile range [IQR] 50.9–69.5) and the median follow-
up was 7.2 years (IQR 3.4–11.3). The median age at diagnosis was 58.6 years (IQR 49.4–67.9). A total of 115,363 deaths
occurred during 7.20 million person-years of follow-up. During the first 1.8 years after diabetes diagnosis, rates of all-cause and
cancer mortality declined and CVD mortality was constant. All mortality rates increased exponentially with age. An earlier
diagnosis of type 2 diabetes (longer duration of disease) was associated with a higher risk of all-cause mortality, primarily driven
by CVD mortality. A 10 year earlier diagnosis (equivalent to 10 years’ longer duration of diabetes) was associated with a 1.2–1.3
times increased risk of all-cause mortality and about 1.6 times increased risk of CVD mortality. The effects were similar in men
and women. For mortality due to cancer (all cancers and colorectal and lung cancers), we found that earlier diagnosis of type 2
diabetes was associated with lower mortality compared with diagnosis at an older age.
Conclusions/interpretation Our findings suggest that younger-onset type 2 diabetes increases mortality risk, and that this is
mainly through earlier CVD mortality. Efforts to delay the onset of type 2 diabetes might, therefore, reduce mortality.

Treatment Options for Type 2 Diabetes in
Adolescents and Youth
Introduction
Type 2 diabetes was once considered as a disease of
middle-aged and older people, but in recent decades the
prevalence of type 2 diabetes in adolescents and young
adults has risen considerably around the world, driven
largely by increasing obesity prevalence at younger ages.
A study from Japan reported that type 2 diabetes in-
creased tenfold in young children (aged 6–12 years) and
doubled among adolescents over a 20 year period from
1976 to 1997 [1]. In Australia, those diagnosed with type
2 diabetes at age 10–39 years accounted for around 9% of
all new cases in the year 2011 [2]. Similar trends have
been found in many countries across the world [3–5],
making young adults the fastest growing group for new-
onset type 2 diabetes. Individuals diagnosed as having
type 2 diabetes at a younger age seem to have an in-
creased risk of developing diabetes-related complications
compared with those diagnosed later in life, suggesting a
more aggressive phenotype [6, 7]. They also possess a
clustering of adverse cardiovascular risk factors at an ear-
lier age. The Treatment Options for Type 2 Diabetes in
Adolescents and Youth (TODAY) study [6, 7] and the
SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth study [8, 9] have both
demonstrated that obesity, dyslipidaemia, hypertension
and microalbuminuria are common in youth with type 2
diabetes and worsen over time. Hillier and Pedula found
that a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes under 45 years of age
was associated with a 14-fold increase in the risk of myo-
cardial infarction compared with control individuals with-
out diabetes, which was substantially greater than the
fourfold increase in those diagnosed over 45 years of
age [10].
In parallel with advances in diabetes care, several re-
cent studies have found a decline over time in the excess
risk of death in people with type 2 diabetes [11, 12].
Nonetheless, a study from Sweden reported that younger
people with type 2 diabetes (age <55 years) who had an
HbA1c level of 6.9% (52 mmol/mol) or less still had a risk
of death that was twice as high as that of the general
population [13]. To date, only limited data are available
for the impact of age at diagnosis on excess mortality in
people with type 2 diabetes. A recent study from
Denmark [11] showed that at any given age, younger
age at diagnosis of type 2 diabetes was associated with
higher mortality for men, but the excess risk attributable
to age at diagnosis was very weak among women. This
study did not examine the impact of age at diagnosis by
different causes of death, which is necessary to help direct
clinical interventions to prevent or reduce premature mor-
bidity and mortality in type 2 diabetes. We therefore ex-
amined in this study the impact of age at diagnosis of type
2 diabetes on the risk of all-cause and cause-specific mor-
tality over 15 years using a large national registry of type
2 diabetes in Australia.

 Methods
Population The National Diabetes Services Scheme (NDSS)
was established in Australia in 1987 to deliver diabetes-related
products at subsidised prices and provide information to peo-
ple with diabetes. Registration of patients is carried out by a
medical practitioner or certified diabetes educator. The NDSS
captures 80–90% of all Australians with known diabetes [14].
In total, 1,108,420 people were registered with type 2 diabetes
on the NDSS between 1997 and 2011. The primary population
for this analysis included 744,188 (67.1%) people with type 2
diabetes who had a date of diagnosis of diabetes listed on the
NDSS. A secondary analysis included all type 2 diabetes reg-
istrants and used date of registration as a proxy for those
whose date of diagnosis was missing (1,108,420 people).
Although the NDSS was initially established in 1987, 1997
was chosen as the start date, as this time period followed a
unification of state-based registries and consequently an im-
provement in data quality. Diabetes type is classified by the
health practitioner who completes the registration. For the
current analysis, type 2 diabetes was assigned to all registrants
who were classified as type 2 on the NDSS. Type 1 diabetes
status was assigned to registrants who were recorded as type 1
on the NDSS registry, were registered at <45 years of age and
were taking insulin. We chose 45 years as the cut-off to min-
imise the number of people with type 1 diabetes that we would
miss without misclassifying significant numbers of people
with type 2 diabetes as type 1 diabetes. In addition, registrants
who were recorded as having type 2 diabetes on the registry
and who were diagnosed before the age of 30 years and were
taking insulin within 1 year of diagnosis were reclassified as
having type 1 diabetes. All others were classified as having
type 2 diabetes.
The NDSS was linked to the National Death Index up to
31 December 2011 by the Australian Institute of Health
and Welfare as reported previously [15, 16]. The underly-
ing cause of death was coded according to ICD-10 (www.
who.int/classifications/icd/en). In the primary analysis,
causes of death were classified as follows: cardiovascular
disease (CVD) I20–I25, I60–I69 or ‘diabetes with circula-
tory complications’ (E10.5, E11.5, E12.5, E13.5, E14.5),
cancer C00–C97 and other underlying causes of death
(non-CVD and non-cancer). We also explored mortality
from ischaemic heart disease (IHD) (I20–I25), stroke
(I60–I69), pancreatic cancer (C25–25.9), lung cancer
(C33–C35.9) and colorectal cancer (C18–C20.9), since
they are among those with the highest cancer death rates
in individuals with diabetes in Australia. Deaths with an
underlying cause corresponding to ‘uncomplicated diabe-
tes’ (E10.9, E11.9, E12.9, E13.9, E14.9) where a CVD,
IHD or stroke ICD code also appeared in the first line of
part I on the death certificate were also included in the
respective group. We considered these deaths as due to
CVD, IHD or stroke, as it is not possible to die from
‘uncomplicated diabetes’. The NDSS dataset linked to the
NDI has previously been used to present age-specific
mortality rates among those with diabetes [17].
Statistical analysis and reporting Individuals were followed
from 1 January 1997, or registration date if later, to 31
December 2011 or date of death, whichever occurred first.
Participants’ follow-up (risk time and deaths) was first split
into intervals of 6 months by current age (0–100 years), cal-
endar time (1997–2011 incl.) and diabetes duration (0–
20 years). Risk time and deaths (overall and by cause) were
subsequently tabulated by current age, date of follow-up and
diabetes duration, and each cell of the table was assigned age,
date and diabetes duration as continuous variables as the mid-
point of the 6 month group. Age at diagnosis was calculated as
current age minus diabetes duration. Data were analysed using
a Poisson model, using log-person-time as the offset variable
and spline effects of current age, diabetes duration and age at
diagnosis, and with a linear effect of calendar time. The model
is formally over-parametrised because age at diagnosis plus
diabetes duration equals current age. Therefore, it is not pos-
sible to tease out the separate effects of age at diabetes diag-
nosis and diabetes duration. We only used the model for pre-
diction of rates, and these do not depend on any particular
parametrisation. Separate models were fitted for men and
women.
The predicted mortality rates by current age for individuals
diagnosed at different ages are shown in Fig. 1. To illustrate
the effect of age at diagnosis and duration of type 2 diabetes,
we computed the mortality rate ratio (also known as HR)
between individuals diagnosed at ages 5 years apart as a func-
tion of age at follow-up (e.g. age 40 vs 45 at diagnosis, follow-
ed from age 45 to 60). Thus, each point on each curve indi-
cates the mortality risk for a person diagnosed at one age
compared with a person diagnosed at 5 years older, when both
individuals have achieved the same age. Different curves were
used to illustrate how this effect varies by age at diagnosis, by
comparing individuals diagnosed at ages 45 vs 50, 50 vs 55,
etc. The same was done for a 10 year difference in diabetes
duration, by comparing individuals diagnosed at ages 40 vs
50, 45 vs 55, etc. The two sets of curves are shown in adjacent
graphs in Fig. 2.
On the basis of the underlying cause of death for people
with type 2 diabetes, we carried out the same analyses for
cause-specific mortality from CVD, cancer and other causes
of death.
We report results on two populations: the primary pop-
ulation is that for which age of diabetes diagnosis is avail-
able (n = 744,188). For this analysis, after excluding 479
registrants, because the registration date was the same as
the date of death or the dates were implausible, the sample
size was 743,709. However, given that only 67% of the
Diabetologia (2018) 61:1055–1063
1057
 entire NDSS type 2 diabetes cohort over the time period
1997–2011 had the date of diabetes recorded, the analysis
was repeated for all registrants using the registration date
as a proxy for those with a missing date of diagnosis (n =
1,108,420). After excluding 743 registrants because the
registration date was the same as the date of death, or
the dates were implausible, the sample size for the sensi-
tivity analysis was 1,107,677.
All analyses and graphs were generated with R soft-
ware, version 3.4.2 (www.R-project.org) (R Foundation
for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria), using
packages Epi and popEpi. The study was approved by the
Alfred Health Human Ethics Committee and the Australian
Institute of Health and Welfare Ethics Committee. All
participants gave informed consent for their data to be
used in the analyses. A complete account of the data
analyses can be found at http://bendixcarstensen.com/IDI/

findings of this study are not publicly available as they
were generated under a licence which restricted access to

Results
Study population characteristics Table 1 describes the charac-
teristics of the 743,709 participants who had a date of diagno-
sis of diabetes (primary analysis cohort) and the full cohort
including those for whom registration was used as a proxy for
the missing age of diagnosis date (n = 1,107,677). In both
groups, the median age at registration was about 60 years,
54% of registrants were men and the median follow-up time
was 7.2 years. In the primary dataset, the median age at diag-
nosis was 58.6 years (interquartile range [IQR] 49.4–67.9)
while in the full dataset, the median age at diagnosis was
59.6 years (interquartile range [IQR] 50.2–68.9). The mortal-
ity rate was higher in the full cohort than in the primary
analysis cohort (26.5 vs 20.9 per 1000 patient-years).
The following results refer to the analysis of individuals
with a known date of diagnosis of type 2 diabetes.

 mortality rates declined during the first 1–2 years after diabe-
tes diagnosis and then increased exponentially with age (Fig.
1a). At any given age, all-cause mortality rates were higher for
a lower age of diagnosis (therefore longer duration) in both
men and women. The all-cause mortality rate ratio for a 5 year
difference in age at diagnosis (the younger age at diagnosis vs
the older age at diagnosis) started below 1.0 but increased to
around 1.2–1.3 during the first 6 years after diagnosis (Fig.
2a). The same pattern was apparent when using a 10 year
difference in age at diagnosis (Fig. 2b). Figure 2a, b also
shows that as age at diagnosis increased, the excess mortality
risk of earlier disease onset (corresponding to longer duration)
was largely constant among women but decreased among
men. The excess risk associated with a 10 year difference of
age was (not surprisingly) greater than that associated with a
5 year difference.
CVD mortality rates increased exponentially with age in
both sexes and across all groups with different ages at diag-
nosis of diabetes (Fig. 1b). At any given age, CVD mortality
also increased with decreasing age at diagnosis (correspond-
ing to increasing duration) of diabetes. Between two men aged
50 years and diagnosed with diabetes at ages 45 and 50 years,
i.e. with 5 years’ difference in diabetes duration, the CVD
mortality risk was approximately 1.4 times as high in the
one diagnosed at the younger age (Fig. 2c, d). This excess risk
fell by age at diagnosis but remained over 1.0 (Fig. 2c,
leftmost curve). As the age of diagnosis increased (e.g. 45 vs
50, compared with 55 vs 60), the excess risk associated with

Fig. 2 Mortality rate ratios for younger onset vs older onset (correspond-
ing to longer vs shorter duration) of diabetes. (a, c, e, g) Mortality rate
ratios between diabetic individuals of the same age but diagnosed 5 years
apart and hence with 5 years’ longer duration of diabetes at any age. The
leftmost pair of curves in each graph is the mortality rate ratio between
people diagnosed at ages 45 and 50, over the 15 year period from age 50
to 65. The next pair shows the mortality rate ratio between people diag-
nosed at ages 50 and 55, as they age from 55 to 70 years old. Moving to
the right, curves show the mortality rate ratios between those diagnosed at
55 and 60, 60 and 65, and 70 and 75. The curves thus represent how the
mortality rate ratio associated with a 5 year difference in duration of
diabetes varies by age and diabetes duration. The differences between
the curves show how the effect of a 5 year difference in duration depends
on age at diagnosis. (b, d, f, h) Similar curves, except for individuals
diagnosed 10 years apart, and hence with 10 years’ longer duration,
showing the effect of a 10 year longer duration of diabetes, comparing
durations 10–20 years with those of 0–10 years (since we only have
reliable data to 20 years of duration). The leftmost curves in each graph
show the mortality rate ratio between people diagnosed at ages 40 and 50.
Moving to the right, the curves show the rate ratios for people diagnosed
at 45 and 55, 50 and 60, 55 and 65, 60 and 70, and 65 and 75. The curves
in this figure thus represent the joint effect of age at diagnosis and dura-
tion of diabetes by comparing successive curves in Fig. 1. (a) All-cause
mortality and 5 years’ difference in age of diabetes onset. (b) All-cause
mortality and 10 years’ difference in age of diabetes onset. (c) CVD

 diagnosis at a younger age was smaller but still apparent.
Similar patterns were seen in women, though the excess risks
of earlier-onset diabetes were slightly higher among women
than among men (Fig. 2c). A similar pattern was seen for
10 years’ difference in duration (equalling 10 years’ difference
in age at diagnosis) but at a higher relative difference (Fig. 2d).
Both IHD mortality and stroke mortality increased with
age. At any given age, IHD and stroke mortality rates were
higher for a lower age of diagnosis (and so longer duration) in
both men and women (ESM Fig. Kn-5, Kn-6).
The cancer mortality rates were high just after diagnosis,
declined during the first 3 years, and then increased with age
(Fig. 1c). The effect of age at diagnosis on cancer mortality
was opposite to that observed for CVD and all-cause
mortality, such that, at any given age, the earlier age at
diagnosis was associated with lower cancer mortality
(Figs 1c 2e, 2f) and was most pronounced among women.
We also analysed three other cancer mortality outcomes:
pancreatic cancer, lung cancer and colorectal cancer (ESM
Fig. Kn-7–9). We observed a sharp increase in pancreatic
cancer mortality shortly after diabetes diagnosis, which
decreased after 3 years, consistent with reverse causation.
The observed pattern is consistent with no effect of duration
or age at diagnosis on mortality (ESM Fig. Kn-9). For lung
cancer, earlier onset of diabetes was associated with lower lung
cancer mortality (ESM Fig. Kn-7). For colorectal cancer, there
was no effect of age of diabetes onset among men, but among
women there was a slightly reduced colorectal cancer mortality
for those with younger-onset diabetes (ESM Fig. Kn-8).
For other causes of death (non-CVD, non-cancer), rates
increased with increasing age, and younger age of diabetes
onset was associated with increased non-CVD, non-cancer
mortality (Fig. 1d). For two people of the same age, but with
5 years’ difference in diabetes onset, the person with the youn-
ger onset of diabetes had an approximately 25–30% higher
non-CVD, non-cancer mortality risk relative to the person
with the older age of onset, at any age. This elevated risk
decreased with increasing age of diagnosis (Fig. 2g, h). For
two individuals at the same age but with 10 years’ difference
in diabetes onset, the person with the younger onset of diabe-
tes had an approximately 40–50% higher non-CVD, non-
cancer mortality risk relative to the person with the older age
at onset, but the effect decreased with increasing age.
In sensitivity analyses, we repeated the entire analysis on
our secondary population (n = 1,107,677) using registration
date as a proxy for date of diabetes diagnosis. We observed
similar patterns to those seen using the cohort who had com-
plete information with regard to age of diagnosis of diabetes.

 and 2011, we showed that a younger age at diagnosis of type 2
diabetes was associated with higher all-cause and CVD, IHD
and stroke mortality, but slightly lower cancer mortality (all-
cause and lung and colorectal cancers), compared with diag-
nosis at an older age. To put these results into context, for two
men of the same age but with 10 years’ difference in diabetes
duration, the one with the earlier onset (and hence longer
duration of diabetes) had an approximately 30% and 60%
greater chance of death from any cause and from CVD, re-
spectively, relative to the man with the shorter duration, at any
age.
Only a limited number of studies have examined the effect
of age at diagnosis on risk of mortality. In studies where this
has been examined most have used age at diagnosis or diabe-
tes duration as a categorical rather than a continuous variable.
A recent study from Denmark [11] showed that, at any given
age, younger age at diagnosis of type 2 diabetes was associ-
ated with higher all-cause mortality for men, but the excess
risk attributable to age at diagnosis was only very weak among
women. This work only examined all-cause mortality and was
clinic-based, in contrast to our findings which showed similar
significant relationships in men and women. Using population
data, our work assessed how long-term overall and cause-
specific mortality depended on current age, age at diagnosis
and diabetes duration in people with type 2 diabetes, and ex-
tended these findings. In a unique approach we demonstrated
that younger age at diagnosis was consistently associated with
higher all-cause and CVD mortality (relative to older age at
diagnosis) across the range of age at diagnosis and in both
men and women in the entire Australian diabetic population.
Even though individuals with early diabetes onset had been
subject to mortality selection for a period, they appeared to
maintain a higher mortality when compared with those with
later onset, due to a combination of the effect of early age at
onset and the effect of duration of type 2 diabetes; however,
these two effects cannot be separated.
Our primary analyses were conducted among the group
with a known date of diagnosis. When we undertook the ana-
lyses in the full cohort, the results were very similar to those
from the cohort with age of diabetes diagnosis data. The char-
acteristics of these two populations were similar except for a
higher crude mortality rate in the full cohort compared with
the primary analysis cohort (restricted to those with a date of
diabetes diagnosis).
It is not fully understood why age at diagnosis and duration
of diabetes are related to mortality. A substantial component
of the excess risk in younger-onset diabetes is likely to be due
to the longer duration of diabetes, which clearly increases the
exposure to hyperglycaemia. Since age is such an important
driver of mortality, it was essential in our analysis to fix the
current age when comparing mortality outcomes of different
ages of onset, meaning that a 5 year earlier age of onset also
meant a 5 year longer duration of diabetes. However, we also
saw that for CVD mortality and for non-CVD, non-cancer
mortality the effect of a 5 or 10 year earlier age of onset was
greater in younger than in older people. This may be because
in younger people there are fewer additional risk factors, and
so the impact of hyperglycaemia is greater than among older
people, in whom a range of other risk factors is typically also
present.
Evidence is accumulating to suggest that earlier onset of
type 2 diabetes is associated with an increased risk of compli-
cations and comorbidities compared with later onset, and that
the development and progression of complications might be
more aggressive in those with earlier onset. In Pima Indians,
youth-onset type 2 diabetes is associated with a similar fre-
quency of overt nephropathy [18] but a substantially increased
incidence of end-stage renal disease compared with adult-
onset type 2 diabetes [19]. Further, in this cohort, retinopathy
risk at 20 years’ diabetes duration was higher for youth-onset
than for older-onset type 2 diabetes despite the younger cur-
rent age. Thus, in contrast to mortality outcomes, for micro-
vascular outcomes the influence of age is not as strong as it is
for diabetes duration.
Findings from other studies also show that those with early-
onset diabetes have worse CVD profiles than those diagnosed
at older ages. A cross-sectional study conducted in a primary
care setting showed that those with early-onset type 2 diabetes
in the UK (mean age 34 years) already had a cardiovascular
risk profile (overweight, hyperlipidaemia, hypertension) sim-
ilar to that of an older adult with type 2 diabetes (mean age
67 years) [20]. Those with early-onset type 2 diabetes are also
more likely to have poorer glucose control, untreated hyper-
tension and hyperlipidaemia [21]. Given this, there have been
several studies which have tried to intervene in such individ-
uals. The TODAY study showed that even with the resources
to encourage consistent early lifestyle modification and the
provision of medications for glycaemic control and aggressive
ACE inhibitor therapy, the prevalence of both hypertension
and microalbuminuria increased markedly over time among
adolescents with type 2 diabetes regardless of diabetes treat-
ment [6]. More recently a small study from Australia showed
that those with diabetes who were diagnosed between 15 and
30 years of age had more severe albuminuria and neuropathy
scores compared with those diagnosed at 40–50 years of age
after adjustment for diabetes duration [22]. As such, increased
clinical attention is imperative for individuals with earlier-
onset type 2 diabetes. Efforts should focus on timely optimi-
sation of individuals’ self-management skills and medical
treatment to prevent or reduce the onset of complications
and comorbidities. Additionally, there is a need to identify
and screen those at high risk of developing diabetes so that
individuals can make lifestyle changes that will prevent or
delay the onset of diabetes.
We observed higher relative mortality in people with re-
cently diagnosed diabetes (<2 years) than for people with

 moderate diabetes duration, which has also been reported in
other studies [23, 24]. This is most likely because people di-
agnosed with diabetes because of other medical conditions
(e.g. cancer) are over-represented among newly diagnosed
individuals and are more likely to die in the first short period
after diagnosis of diabetes.
The link between type 2 diabetes and cancer has been con-
sistently documented for a large array of different cancer sites
and irrespective of the study design [25–27]. Interestingly, we
found that earlier age at diagnosis of diabetes seemed to be
related to lower cancer mortality, which was in contrast to
CVD mortality. It is possible that following a diagnosis of
diabetes, people have more frequent contact with the
healthcare system, which may increase the likelihood of any
present but undiagnosed cancer being detected. Our previous
study showed that cancer incidence was significantly higher in
the first 3 months after registration on the NDSS, suggesting
the presence of detection bias and/or reverse causation among
newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic individuals [16]. Similarly,
we demonstrate this in the current analysis with mortality from
pancreatic cancer. This may contribute to better cancer surviv-
al for individuals with earlier age at diagnosis of diabetes.
Strengths and limitations The main strength of this study was
the use of population-based administrative data with a large
sample size and long follow-up time. The results are therefore
unlikely to be confounded by data collection procedures.
Hence, our results are likely to be generalisable to Western
countries similar to Australia.
A key weakness is that the NDSS lacks information on
potentially important covariates, such as ethnicity, smoking
status, weight or BMI, glycaemic control, physical activity,
treatment and comorbidities.
In conclusion, occurrence of type 2 diabetes at an earlier
age places individuals at increased risk of premature death,
especially from CVD. Early and aggressive risk factor man-
agement is warranted for individuals with young-onset type 2
diabetes.
