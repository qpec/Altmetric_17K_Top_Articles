Abstract. A modular video endoscope is developed to enable both white light imaging (WLI) and vital-dye fluo-
rescence imaging (VFI) in a single-endoscopic insertion for the early detection of cancer in Barrett’s esophagus
(BE). We demonstrate that VFI can be achieved in conjunction with white light endoscopy, where appropriate
white balance is used to correct for the presence of the emission filter. In VFI mode, a contrast enhancement
feature is implemented in real time to further highlight glandular patterns in BE and related malignancies without
introducing artifacts. In a pilot study, we demonstrate accurate correlation of images in two widefield modalities,
with representative images showing the disruption and effacement of glandular architecture associated with
cancer development in BE. VFI images of these alterations exhibit enhanced contrast when compared to
WLI. Results suggest that the usefulness of VFI in the detection of BE-related neoplasia should be further evalu-
ated in future in vivo studies. © The Authors. Published by SPIE under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. Distribution or

Introduction
The burden of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) has increased
at an alarming rate in western countries, due to a combination of
rising incidence and poor outcomes.1–5 Since Barrett’s esopha-
gus (BE) is the major risk factor for EAC, patients with BE are
usually recommended to undergo surveillance endoscopy at
regular intervals.6 However, dysplasia in BE can often be missed
with standard white light imaging (WLI),7 and there is a critical
need for new endoscopic techniques to improve the accuracy of
early detection of EAC and its precursors.
A variety of imaging modalities have been developed to
probe different aspects of cancer progression in BE. For exam-
ple, narrow-band imaging targets endogenous hemoglobin
absorption to highlight the vascular network and autofluores-
cence imaging excites endogenous fluorophores to detect BE-
associated malignancies.8–12 The use of exogenous dyes, such
as in Lugol’s chromoendoscopy or fluorescein targeted confocal
laser endomicroscopy, can further enhance the contrast between
neoplastic tissue and surrounding normal mucosa.13–15 Other
sources of contrast include changes in subsurface scattering
measured via optical coherence tomography.16,17
Recently, we developed vital-dye fluorescence imaging
(VFI), a modality that highlights nuclear morphology and
enhances glandular patterns by staining the epithelial nuclei
to potentially red-flag abnormal lesions and bridge widefield im-
aging with high-resolution imaging.18 While images obtained
with the initial prototype VFI system improved the ability to
monitor changes in glandular morphology, the first-generation
(G1) system used an external cap for the VFI imaging,
which necessitated removal of the endoscope, placement of a
cap, and reinsertion for the transition from WLI to VFI.
Moreover, the multiple insertions made it difficult to correlate
regions imaged in the two modalities. To overcome these bar-
riers, here we describe a second-generation modular video endo-
scope (G2 MVE) that incorporates WLI and VFI in a single-
endoscopic insertion. Both WLI and VFI are enabled with a
removable cap module and the endoscopist can seamlessly
switch between the two modalities throughout the procedure.
The removable cap design can readily expand the imaging
capability of different existing endoscopes to include fluores-
cence imaging by installing a laser diode and attaching the
cap. A contrast enhancement algorithm is also integrated in
real time in VFI mode to further improve visualization of meta-
plastic glands associated with BE. Images illustrating progres-
sion from metaplasia to dysplasia and cancer are acquired during
in vivo esophageal endoscopy in both modalities.

Materials and Methods
2.1
Instrumentation
The G1 of the MVE consisted of a modified commercial Pentax
endoscopy system (Pentax EPK-i processor, EG-2990i endo-
scope) and an interchangeable module to achieve VFI.18 The
VFI module of the MVE system was designed for use with pro-
flavine, a topically applied vital dye. The aminoacridine-derived
dye preferentially stains DNA in cell nuclei, providing strong
contrast between cell nuclei and surrounding cytoplasm.19–21
With a small size, the amphipathic molecule can easily cross
cell membranes and thus permits rapid topical application.22
Proflavine has been used in the triple dye as an antibacterial

 agent on the newborn’s umbilical cord.23 Several in vivo studies
also reported that the dye can be safely delivered to image epi-
thelium in the gastrointestinal tract, oral cavity, and cervix with-
out adverse effects.24–26
As shown in Fig. 1, proflavine has absorption and emission
maxima at ∼450 and 515 nm, respectively.27 To image profla-
vine fluorescence using the G1 MVE, a 455-nm laser diode was
installed, replacing the auxiliary white light LED in the EPK-i
processor and the VFI module included a 500-nm long-pass fil-
ter (LPF) that was placed in front of the CCD camera for fluo-
rescence imaging. Because the 500-nm LPF in the VFI module
blocks blue light from reaching the CCD camera, the VFI mod-
ule must be removed for WLI. Thus, the G1 MVE required two
separate scope insertions for WLI and VFI.
In the G2 MVE, a 405-nm laser diode (Nichia Corporation,
Tokyo, Japan) was installed to provide illumination in VFI mode.
As in the G1 system, the diode replaced the auxiliary white light
LED in the EPK-i and was powered by a laser driver (Wavelength
Electronics, Bozeman, Montana). Since the diode has an optical
output of ∼1.2 W (to our knowledge, it is the most powerful
405-nm diode laser at the time of system development), a custom-
ized aluminum heatsink was installed and air-cooled. Through
mechanical control, the illumination source could be switched
between a Xenon lamp for WLI and the laser diode for VFI.
Although the absorption of proflavine is reduced at 405 nm, shift-
ing the illumination to 405 nm allowed for the installation of
a 435-nm LPF (Schott North America, Duryea, Pennsylvania) in
place of the original 500-nm LPF, permitting more blue light to
reach the CCD and allowing WLI without removal of the VFI
module. As in the G1 MVE, the filter was installed in a customized
stainless steel cap and secured to the distal endoscope tip by a com-
mercially available halo cap (Covidien, Sunnyvale, California), as
shown in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b). The LPF combined a colored absorp-
tion glass (GG435, 4.6-mm × 4.8-mm × 0.5-mm thick) with a
custom coating to accommodate angular fields of view (FOVs)
up to �70 deg. At a typical working distance of 5 to 10 mm,
the FOV ranges from 15 to 25 mm. The laser diode excitation
and the emission filter spectra of the G1 and G2 systems are mea-
sured using an Ocean USB2000 spectrometer (Ocean Optics,
Dunedin, Florida) and a Cary 5000 spectrophotometer (Agilent
Technologies, Santa Clara, California), respectively, and shown
in Fig. 1(c). A detailed comparison of the two systems, including
the excitation source, emission filter, light guide transmission, and
proflavine absorption, is shown in Table 1.
2.1.1
White balance in WLI
The 435-nm LPF in the VFI module of the G2 MVE still blocks
blue light below 435 nm from reaching the CCD camera during
WLI. To compensate for the light loss in the blue spectral range
during WLI, white balance was performed in white light images
with the EPK-i processor using color balance options provided

(b) The LPF is installed in the steel housing and secured by a Halo cap. (c) In the G2 MVE, the excitation
wavelength is shifted from 455 to 405 nm. A 435-nm LPF is used in VFI mode as the emission filter, as
well as in conventional WLI with white balance.

 on the front panel for the red and blue components of the RGB
image. For each component, 11 adjustment levels were available
ranging from −5 to þ5 and could be adjusted in real time. The
optimal white balance levels were determined by imaging a
white balance target (X-Rite, Grand Rapids, Michigan) with
the LPF removed and with the LPF in place. The color differ-
ence between each image with the LP filter in or out of the opti-
cal path was calculated based on the CIEDE2000 formula,28 and
the color balance levels yielding the minimum color difference
were determined as the optimal white balance setting. To assess
the performance of white balance, ex vivo white light images of a
mouse stomach were acquired with and without the LPF in
place; probability mass functions (PMF) of the original WLI
image were compared to these of the color-balanced image
obtained with the LPF in place.
2.1.2
Contrast enhancement in VFI
A contrast enhancement feature was implemented via Labview
(Labview 2012, National Instruments) in VFI mode to highlight
glandular patterns in BE, the distortion and effacement of which
have been shown to be associated with cancer progression.18
This feature utilized an unsharp filter to enhance edges in the
image. During unsharp masking, the original image was first
smoothed by an average filter Fs. An unsharp mask M was
then obtained by subtracting the blurred image from the original;
the resulting weighted mask was added to the original image to
produce a sharpened image. The process is summarized in the
following equation:

¼ fðx; yÞ þ k½fðx; yÞ − fðx; yÞ�;

with fðx; yÞ, fðx; yÞ, and gðx; yÞ denoting the original,
smoothed, and enhanced images, respectively. In Labview,
the smoothing filter used to blur the original VFI image is

The level of enhancement was tuned by adjusting the con-
stant k. In this study, an unsharp mask with k ¼ 2 was used.
The enhanced VFI mode was initially tested with in vivo VFI
images. As indicated in Eq. (1), the intensities of the unsharp
mask M are proportional to the difference between the original
and enhanced images. The variances of the unsharp mask pixel
intensities in two regions of interest (ROIs), as defined in squ-
amous and columnar epithelium, respectively, were compared to
verify more significant enhancement of glandular patterns in
metaplastic areas. The algorithm was then implemented in
real time and contrast-enhanced videos were displayed during
endoscopy without compromising the frame rate.
2.1.3
System performance
Two sources of background were potentially present in the im-
aging system—leakage of excitation light and autofluorescence
of optical components when illuminated by a 405-nm laser. To
verify that any background signal was minimal compared to pro-
flavine fluorescence in VFI mode, nonfluorescent frosted quartz
was used as a negative control to approximate the amount of
excitation light that would typically be backscattered into the
collection
optics,
resulting
in
system
autofluorescence.
During ex vivo imaging, proflavine stained columnar epithelium
of an excised mouse stomach was first imaged in VFI mode to
obtain the fluorescence signal; the background signal was then
measured by imaging the frosted quartz at the same working
distance and compared to proflavine fluorescence. The signal
to background ratio was above 10, indicating minimal excitation
leakage in fluorescence images.
2.2
Pilot Study
An in vivo pilot study using the G2 MVE was conducted in a
high-risk population of subjects with BE at Mount Sinai
Medical Center. Patients who had histologically confirmed
Barrett’s metaplasia, dysplasia, or EAC and were scheduled
for routine surveillance or endoscopic treatment were eligible
for enrollment. The study information was provided to eligible
patients and written informed consent was obtained. This pilot
study was IRB-approved at both Mount Sinai Medical Center
and Rice University.
2.2.1
Imaging procedure
The G2 MVE was used to examine the esophagus. Compared
with the G1 MVE, which requires two separate insertions, G2
MVE allows for a more convenient imaging protocol (Fig. 2).
Prior to imaging, 10 ml of 0.01% proflavine solution is prepared
by a pharmacist using proflavine hemisulfate salt hydrate pow-
der (purity by titration ≥98%, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,
Missouri). The VFI module was attached before endoscopic
insertion and white balance was set. Conventional WLI was per-
formed followed by topical application of proflavine (5 to 10 ml,
0.01%) through a spray catheter (Olympus America, Center
Valley, Pennsylvania), which was inserted through the biopsy
channel of the endoscope. Following proflavine application,
the esophagus was rinsed with water, and VFI images were

 then obtained with contrast enhancement. The entire imaging
procedure was performed by a single expert endoscopist (SA).
Previously developed imaging criteria were used during
the endoscopy to identify abnormalities through the BE
segment.18,21 Sites were considered suspicious in VFI mode
if they revealed disrupted or effaced glandular architecture.
Notes on location information of each imaged site were
taken: endoscope depth and quadrant, time stamps, and clinical
landmarks (such as islands, ulceration, or bleeding).
Suspicious regions in either WLI or VFI were biopsied post-
imaging; standard four-quadrant biopsies were acquired every 1
to 2 cm in the BE segment together with controls from nonsuspi-
cious metaplastic areas. All biopsies were examined by a single
pathologist (AP). Images were extracted from videos in each
modality and correlated for each imaged site. Extracted frames
for each site were reviewed (YT, JC, SA, RRK) and compared to
the histopathology results.
2.2.2
Contrast quantification and evaluation
The contrast of representative images obtained in the pilot study
was quantified. Lab variance, defined as the geometrical mean
of the variance in each channel of the CIELAB colorspace, has
been shown to correlate well with perceived contrast of color
images showing different content.29 This metric was calculated
to assess and compare the contrast of WLI and VFI images.
In each image, three ROIs (100 × 100 pixels) showing rep-
resentative features were selected; the Lab variance of selected
ROIs was calculated and averaged to evaluate image contrast.
The mean Lab variance in each VFI image was compared to
that in the corresponding WLI image for different diagnostic
categories. The quantitative results were also compared with
the qualitative findings in these images.

System Performance
3.1.1
White balance in WLI
The optimal white balance levels in the G2 MVE were deter-
mined by comparing images of a white balance target with
and without the G2 VFI module in place. The CIE2000 color
differences between the original WLI image (with the G2
VFI module removed) and images at available color balance lev-
els (Blue −5 to þ5, Red −5 to þ5) with the G2 VFI module in
place were calculated. The color balance levels yielding the min-
imum color difference were Blue þ5 and Red þ1, which were
used as the optimal white balance setting for the G2 MVE dur-
ing WLI. Similarly, for the G1 VFI module, the optimal white
balance levels available were Blue þ5 and Red −1; however, the
color difference at the optimal white balance levels in the G2
MVE was decreased by approximately one order of magnitude
compared to the G1 MVE.
Ex vivo WLI images of an excised mouse stomach were
obtained to verify the white balance performance. The stomach
was imaged with and without the G1 or G2 VFI modules in
place as shown in Figs. 3(a), 3(b), and 3(d). Corrected images
were acquired with the VFI modules at the corresponding opti-
mal white balance levels (i.e., Blue þ5, Red −1 for G1, and Blue
þ5, Red þ1 for G2). The available white balance levels failed to
restore the original color in the G1 corrected image as shown in
Fig. 3(c). In contrast, the G2 uncorrected image in Fig. 3(d)
appeared significantly less yellow as compared to the G1 uncor-
rected image; the color was further corrected using the optimal
white balance levels, as shown in Fig. 3(e). The PMF of the blue
channel in the same ROI [black box in Fig. 3(a)], as shown in
Fig. 3(F), reveals nearly total elimination of blue light by the G1
VFI module, and only partial loss with the G2 VFI module,

 allowing for appropriate compensation using the optimal white
balance levels.
3.1.2
Contrast enhancement in VFI
Since irregularity of the glandular architecture in BE was shown
to be an indicator of dysplasia and cancer,18 a contrast enhance-
ment feature was integrated to highlight the glands; its perfor-
mance was assessed using in vivo VFI images. Figure 4(a)
shows the original VFI image of an island of BE surrounded
by squamous epithelium. The BE island reveals regular and
intact glandular patterns as normally seen in columnar epi-
thelium; the squamous epithelium shows no apparent structures
with a homogeneous appearance across the FOV. In the
enhanced VFI image in Fig. 4(b), edges of glands on the BE
island are sharpened while the appearance of squamous epi-
thelium remains homogeneous. Two ROIs, as defined in
Fig. 4(b), show the columnar epithelium enclosed by the yellow
box and squamous epithelium by the white box, respectively.
Figure 4(c) shows the boxplot of unsharp mask intensities
(on a scale of 0 to 255) in two types of epithelium. An
F-test shows that the 95% CI of variance ratio in the two
ROIs is 2.82 to 3.05 (p < 0.05), indicating that the unsharp filter
highlights the glands while introducing a minimal level of arti-
facts in the uniform squamous epithelium.
3.2
In Vivo Pilot Study: Representative Images
In vivo endoscopy was performed on three patients. Images were
acquired in WLI and VFI modes and biopsies were taken.
Figure 5 shows representative images of sites diagnosed as nor-
mal BE, HGD, and carcinoma with the corresponding histopa-
thology. Both WLI and VFI images were contrast enhanced at
the same enhancement level. In Fig. 5(a), normal BE is charac-
terized in WLI by intact gland borders that are evenly spaced. In
VFI mode, as shown in Fig. 5(b), the regular glandular archi-
tecture is highlighted with enhanced contrast. The glandular pat-
terns are apparent in the histopathology image in Fig. 5(c),
which also shows the presence of goblet cells as a hallmark
of normal BE (black arrows). From normal BE to HGD, the
glandular patterns become distorted and disrupted in WLI.
The distortion of borders is shown in VFI mode with sharpened
Fig. 5 In vivo images of normal BE, HGD, and carcinoma in WLI and VFI with the corresponding histo-
pathology, and mean Lab variances of selected ROIs in each image. From normal BE (a) to HGD (e) in
WLI, glandular patterns appear more distorted and disrupted. The loss of glandular architecture is high-
lighted in VFI with enhanced contrast (f). Progressing to carcinoma, the WLI image (i) indicates glandular
effacement and abnormal vascularization; the VFI image (j) shows further distortion (yellow solid box)
and effacement of glands (white solid box). Histopathology of normal BE (c) shows regular and intact
glands with presence of goblet cells (black arrows); absence of goblet cells is observed in HGD (g), which
also reveals disruption of glandular patterns. This glandular pattern is effaced in carcinoma (k), confirm-
ing previous findings in WLI and VFI. The mean Lab variances of selected ROIs (white-dashed boxes)
are higher in all VFI images than their corresponding WLI images, indicating that VFI presents enhanced
contrast than WLI. The error bars show the standard deviation.

 edges; when compared to normal BE, some areas show near
effacement of the glandular architecture. In carcinoma, the
WLI image in Fig. 5(i) reveals glandular effacement with abnor-
mal vascularization. The VFI image in Fig. 5(j) shows severe
distortion and disruption of glands in the ROI enclosed by
the yellow solid box, and almost total effacement of glandular
architecture in the ROI enclosed by the white solid box. The
corresponding pathology, as revealed in Fig. 5(k), shows total
obliteration of glands and absence of goblet cells.
The mean Lab variance of selected ROIs (white-dashed
boxes) with the standard deviation in each diagnostic category
is shown in Figs. 5(d), 5(h), and 5(l). The Lab variance of VFI
images in all diagnostic categories is higher than corresponding
WLI images and shows as much as a 10-fold enhancement for
normal BE, indicating improved contrast in VFI when compared
with WLI. Contrast in VFI images decreases with disease pro-
gression due to the distortion and effacement of glandular pat-
terns associated with neoplastic progression. Contrast in WLI
images increases with disease progression, due to increased vas-
cular atypia during neoplastic progression. Nonetheless, average
contrast in VFI images is higher than in corresponding WLI
images for all disease categories. This is consistent with quali-
tative assessment of VFI images showing improved visualiza-
tion of glandular patterns.

Discussion
In this research, we report the development and initial clinical
use of a G2 MVE. The system can perform both white light
endoscopy and VFI in a single-endoscopic insertion. In VFI
mode, a real-time contrast enhancement algorithm allows
improved visualization of glandular patterns in metaplasia
and neoplasia compared to standard WLI. The ability to switch
between VFI and standard WLI allows for convenient and accu-
rate correlation between the two imaging modalities.
Disruption and effacement of the glandular architecture is
associated with cancer progression in BE;18,30,31 these findings
are verified in Fig. 5. Visual assessment of WLI and VFI images
of normal BE shows that glands are more readily apparent in
VFI than WLI images; the alterations of glandular patterns in
HGD and EAC are also discerned more readily in VFI images.
Using Lab variance as a measure of image contrast, the quali-
tative findings are confirmed, with VFI images showing higher
contrast. Since VFI targets glandular architecture through nuclei
staining, it also allows for potential integration with high-reso-
lution imaging and thus enables investigation of the nuclei at
two different spatial scales. Results of this pilot trial suggest
that additional studies are warranted to determine the overall
accuracy of dysplasia/EAC detection using the G2 MVE.
Multimodal imaging has been achieved in other advanced
imaging platforms. For example, narrow-band imaging, auto-
fluorescence imaging, and chromoendoscopy can be performed
in conjunction with standard WLI. Compared to these imaging
modalities, VFI targets alterations in epithelial glandular pat-
terns during cancer progression. Moreover, it is implemented
using a removable cap that can be readily adapted to existing
commercial platforms with the installation of a laser diode.
With increased ease of use, the effectiveness of the G2 MVE
can be further evaluated in various clinical settings. This imag-
ing platform can also be extended to other gastrointestinal sites
to study glandular alterations related to the progression of meta-
plasia to neoplasia, such as the stomach and colon.21,32 As
previously shown, the module design is compatible with a
probe-based endomicroscope, which can be added to aid in
the detection of early disease.18,20 Other modalities, such as
fiber-based optical coherence tomography and Raman spectros-
copy, could also be used in conjunction to accomplish imaging
at multiple resolutions.33,34
