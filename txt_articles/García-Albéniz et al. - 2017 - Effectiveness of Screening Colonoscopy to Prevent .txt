Abstract
Background—No randomized controlled trials of screening colonoscopies have been completed, 
and ongoing trials exclude subjects aged 75 years or older. The Medicare program, however, 
reimburses screening colonoscopies without an upper age limit.
Objective—To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of screening colonoscopy to prevent 
colorectal cancer in individuals aged 70–74 and 75–79.
Design Setting—Large-scale, population-based, prospective study. The observational data was 
used to emulate a target trial with 2 arms: colonoscopy screening and no screening.
Participants—1,355,692 Medicare individuals (2004–2012) aged 70–79 at average risk for CRC 
who used Medicare preventive services and had no previous diagnostic or surveillance 
colonoscopies in the previous five years.
Measurements—Eight-year risk of CRC and 30-day risk of adverse events.

 Results—In the 70–74 age group, the 8-year risk of CRC (95% CI) was 2.19% (2.00, 2.37) in the 
colonoscopy screening arm and 2.62% (2.56, 2.67) in the no screening arm; absolute risk 
difference −0.42% (−0.24, −0.63). In the 75–79 age group, the 8-year risk of CRC (95% CI) was 
2.84% (2.54, 3.13) in the colonoscopy screening arm and 2.97% (2.92, 3.03) in the no screening 
arm; risk difference −0.14% (−0.41, 0.16). The excess 30-day risk of any adverse event in the 
colonoscopy arm was 5.6 adverse events per 1,000 individuals (95% CI 4.4–6.8) in the 70–74 age 
group and 10.3 adverse events per 1,000 individuals (95% CI 8.6–11.1) in the 75–79 group.
Limitations—CRC-specific mortality was not available, but we studied CRC incidence and stage 
at diagnosis.
Conclusions—Our findings suggest a modest benefit of screening colonoscopy for the 
prevention of CRC in beneficiaries aged 70–74 years, and a smaller benefit in older beneficiaries. 
The risk of adverse events was low, but greater among older individuals.
Introduction
There are 132,000 new cases of colorectal cancer (CRC) and 50,000 CRC-related deaths 
each year in the US (1). Colonoscopy is expected to reduce CRC mortality by detecting 
asymptomatic, curable cancers and CRC incidence by detecting and removing precancerous 
polyps. However, despite being widely used in the US (2), no randomized controlled trials of 
screening colonoscopy have been completed. The findings of three ongoing randomized 
trials (3–5) will be not be available before the mid 2020s. Previously conducted randomized 
trials showed the effectiveness of other screening methods: periodic fecal occult blood 
testing (FOBT) reduces CRC mortality (6–10) and sigmoidoscopy (performed once (11–14) 
or twice within 3–5 years(15)) reduces both CRC incidence and CRC mortality (16).
Colonoscopy is an invasive, resource-demanding procedure that requires a thorough large 
bowel cleansing and often patient sedation, and that carries a risk of complications such as 
bowel perforations. Establishing the effectiveness and safety of colonoscopy is important 
because less burdensome screening methods (FOBT and sigmoidoscopy) are available. 
Currently, the United States Preventive Service Task Force (USPSTF) recommends routine 
CRC screening using any screening tests for individuals at average CRC risk, from age 50 
up through age 75, and recommends individualizing screening decisions for individuals aged 
76–85 years (17). Other guidelines recommend colonoscopy screening without an upper age 
limit (18,19). None of the ongoing colonoscopy trials include individuals over age 75 (only 
one includes individuals age 70 or older, eTable 1), but healthy persons over 75 could live 
sufficiently long to benefit from CRC screening.
Medicare has reimbursed screening colonoscopies for over a decade without an upper age 
limit. We use the extensive experience of Medicare beneficiaries to estimate the 
effectiveness of screening colonoscopy for the prevention of CRC among elderly individuals 
with no recent history of colonoscopy, colorectal cancer, or adenomas. We study individuals 
aged 70–74 and 75–79 years separately.

 Methods
Study data
For a random 20% sample of Medicare beneficiaries from the years 1999 to 2012, we 
extracted information on demographic characteristics (age, sex, race, original reason for 
Medicare entitlement, and census bureau division), enrollment characteristics (reason for 
entitlement, enrollment type and period) and Medicare Chronic Conditions Data Warehouse 
condition categories (including CRC diagnosis) from the denominator files; colonoscopies 
and FOBTs from the outpatient standard analytic files, the inpatient hospital claims, and the 
carrier files (to identify physician services). We used the outpatient and carrier files to 
extract information on the use of preventive services and wellness visits. We computed a 
combined comorbidity score (20) and used the procedure codes on the colonoscopy claim 
and the presence of a pathology bill for examination of a colorectal polyp or biopsy within 
seven days of the procedure to classify colonoscopies as having performed a polypectomy or 
not (21). We used the SEER-Medicare linked dataset (22) (years 1999 to 2009) to evaluate 
CRC stage (see Supplementary material for details).
Eligibility criteria
Our analyses included individuals aged 70–79 without history of prior colorectal cancer 
who, in the five years before baseline (see below), had no history of adenoma, inflammatory 
bowel disease or colectomy, had not received a colonoscopy, sigmoidoscopy or FOBT. 
These eligibility criteria are as similar as possible to those of the ongoing colonoscopy trials 
(3–5) (eTable 1 in the Supplementary material), which generally target average-risk 
population.
To ensure complete capture of health information we included only individuals enrolled in 
Medicare parts A and B, and not in Medicare Advantage, during the preceding five years. To 
reduce the probability of including individuals who received colonoscopy for reasons other 
than screening, we (i) excluded those who had received an abdominal CT scan, barium 
enema or a diagnosis (23) of anemia, gastrointestinal bleeding, constipation, diarrhea, 
abdominal pain, irritable bowel syndrome, bowel habits change, weight loss, ischemic bowel 
disease, or diverticular disease in the previous 6 months, and (ii) included only health-
conscious individuals who had received at least two out of the three preventive services 
offered yearly by Medicare for the average population (annual wellness visit, influenza 
vaccine, breast cancer screening and prostate cancer screening) in the previous two years 
(24). Though the effectiveness of some of these services is questionable (PSA-based prostate 
cancer screening), we only used them here as surrogates for health consciousness. We relax 
these constraints in sensitivity analyses (see Supplementary material).
Treatment arms and follow-up
To emulate a trial of screening colonoscopy and CRC incidence in the elderly, we exploited 
the experiences of Medicare beneficiaries after their 70th birthdate. Specifically, we 
identified all 70-year old beneficiaries who met the eligibility criteria on the day they turn 70 
(baseline) and followed them until CRC diagnosis, death, violation of Medicare enrolment 
criteria, or December 2012, whichever occurred earlier. At baseline, we classified

 beneficiaries into the screening colonoscopy arm if they received a colonoscopy in the next 
seven days and into the no screening arm otherwise. To reduce computational time, we used 
a 5% random subsample of those in the no screening arm.
Next, using an approach previously described (25–29), we emulated a second trial with 
baseline a week after that of the first trial, and so on for every week while an individual was 
70 years old. At the baseline week of each of these 52 sequential trials, eligibility criteria 
were reassessed. Beneficiaries who stopped meeting the eligibility criteria (e.g., because of a 
recent colonoscopy) were excluded from that trial; all others were reclassified into the two 
arms according to whether they had a colonoscopy during that week. We repeated the entire 
process for ages 71 to 79, which resulted in a total of 520 emulated trials. Each beneficiary 
may contribute as an eligible individual in as many trials as she is eligible for between the 
week she turns age 70 until the week she turns 80. Emulation of sequential trials is a valid 
and efficient procedure when beneficiaries can meet eligibility criteria at multiple times 
(25,30).
We also conducted analyses with an FOBT arm to assess the performance of our 
observational estimates against the published estimates from the FOBT randomized trials as 
a validity check for our method. We did not evaluate sigmoidoscopy because it was 
infrequently used in the Medicare population (eFigure 1 in the Supplementary material).
Outcomes
The primary outcome was CRC incidence. We also identified all adverse events occurring 
within 30 days after baseline that were severe enough to require an emergency department 
visit or hospitalization. We classified adverse events into “serious gastrointestinal events” 
(perforation, gastrointestinal bleeding requiring transfusion), “other gastrointestinal events” 
(gastrointestinal bleeding not requiring transfusion, paralytic ileus, nausea, vomiting and 
dehydration, abdominal pain), and “cardiovascular events” (myocardial infarction or angina, 
arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, cardiac or respiratory arrest, syncope, hypotension or 
shock) (21). We evaluated tumor stage among diagnosed CRC cases.
Statistical analysis
We pooled the individuals across all emulated trials and analyzed the data by age group (70–
74, 75–79 years). We estimated curves for CRC cumulative incidence, both unadjusted and 
standardized to the baseline characteristics shown on Table 1: sex, race, age (linear and 
quadratic terms), original reason for entitlement, comprehensive preventive evaluation in the 
previous 2 years, use of 3 preventive services in the previous 2 years, census bureau division, 
combined comorbidity score, presence of each Chronic Condition Warehouse condition, 
calendar month. As in randomized trials, these curves estimate risks under hypothetical 
scenarios in which individuals do not die from causes other than CRC (16).
To estimate the standardized curves, we fit a pooled logistic regression model for monthly 
CRC risk (31,32) that included an indicator for the screening arm, a flexible function of 
months of follow-up (linear, quadratic and exponentially decreasing term), product terms for 
arm and month, and the trial-specific baseline covariates (33) (detailed explanation in the 
Technical Appendix).

 We also estimated the 30-day risk of adverse events standardized by age, sex and 
comorbidity score. We used a non-parametric bootstrap based on 500 individual-level 
resamplings to compute 95% confidence intervals. All analyses were conducted with SAS 
9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). The Partners Human Research Committee and the 
Institutional Review Board at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health approved our 
research.

Results
Of 3,586,046 Medicare beneficiaries reaching age 70 between the years 2004–2012, 674,306 
had no previous CRC, were asymptomatic and without 5-year history of adenoma, 
inflammatory bowel disease, colectomy or screening. Of these, 136,310 were users of 
Medicare annual preventive services and thus eligible for our analyses. On average, each of 
these beneficiaries was eligible for 49.7 of the 52 emulated trials starting each week during 
the following year. After randomly selecting 5% of those in the no screening arm and 
pooling over all sequential trials, there were 348,025 (non-unique) individuals: 10,034 
assigned to the screening colonoscopy arm and 337,991 to the no screening arm (Figure 1). 
The selection and assignment of beneficiaries aged 71 to 79 years is shown in the 
Supplementary material (eFigure 2). After pooling over all age groups, a total of 78,065 
individuals were assigned to the screening colonoscopy arm, and 3,390,836 to the no 
screening arm. Median follow-up was 40 months (interquartile range 18–67 months).
Individual baseline characteristics were similar across the two arms, but the colonoscopy 
arm had a lower proportion of some chronic diseases (Alzheimer’s and related disorders, 
chronic heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, ischemic heart disease 
and stroke), a higher proportion of preventive services use in the 2 years before inclusion, 
and a higher proportion of some diagnoses (cataracts, benign prostatic hyperplasia and 
hyperlipidemia) that might reflect a higher utilization of health care services (Table 1).
Effectiveness of screening
During follow-up, there were 1,282 individuals diagnosed with CRC in the colonoscopy arm 
(685 aged 70–74, 597 aged 75–79) and 45,530 in the no screening arm (21,954 aged 70–74, 
23,576 aged 75–79).
Because of detection of prevalent cancers at screening, the risk of CRC at baseline was 
higher in the colonoscopy arm (0.89% in the 70–74 age group and 1.14% in the 75–79 age 
group) than in the no screening arm (0.03% in both age groups), as expected. The curves 
crossed after about 4.5 years in the 70–74 age group and 5.5 years in the 75–79 age group, 
when the CRC risk became higher in the no screening arm (Figure 2). Adjustment for 
baseline covariates did not materially change the curves (eFigure 3 in the Supplementary 
material).

 In the 70–74 age group, the standardized 8-year risk of CRC (95% CI) was 2.19% (2.00, 
2.37) in the colonoscopy screening arm and 2.62% (2.56, 2.67) in the no screening arm; risk 
difference −0.42% (−0.24, −0.63). In the 75–79 age group, the standardized 8-year risk of 
CRC (95% CI) was 2.84% (2.54, 3.13) in the colonoscopy screening arm and 2.97% (2.92, 
3.03) in the no screening arm; risk difference −0.14% (−0.41, 0.16). Sensitivity analyses 
with different cutoff points for age (70–73 vs. 74–79 and 70–75 vs. 76–79) did not 
materially change results. A sensitivity analysis excluding enrollment from 2010–2012 
(median follow-up, 58 months) yielded similar results: in the 70–74 age group the risk 
difference was −0.43% (−0.65, −0.21) and in the 75–79 age group the risk difference was 
−0.14% (−0.45, 0.18). Results did not vary by calendar time (eFigure 4).
In the subgroup of CRC cases that were linked to the SEER registry, 1,102 cases were 
diagnosed at screening colonoscopy and 24,969 without screening. The proportion of CRC 
cases in Stage 0 was 14.3% for screening colonoscopy vs. 8.1% for no screening, in Stage I 
37.8% vs. 24.6%, in Stage II 19.1% vs. 26.7%, in Stage III 22.1% vs. 24.0 and in Stage IV 
6.7% vs. 16.7%. Results were similar across age groups (eTable 3 in the Supplementary 
material).
We also evaluated colonoscopy-based surveillance after the initial screening. The use of 
colonoscopy peaks at years 3 and 5 among individuals in whom the screening colonoscopy 
removed a polyp, and is very low until year 5 among those in whom the screening 
colonoscopy that did not find a polyp. These patterns were present in both age groups 
(eFigure 5 in the Supplementary material).
In analyses that compared FOBT versus no screening, the CRC risk in the FOBT arm was 
always higher than in the no screening arm because of the detection of some (but not all) 
prevalent cancers at baseline (eTable 2 and eFigure 3 in the Supplementary material), as 
expected. Individuals in the FOBT arm frequently received a colonoscopy shortly after 
inclusion into the study, presumably due to a positive FOBT result.
Safety of Screening
Compared with the no screening arm, the excess 30-day risk of any adverse event requiring 
hospitalization or a visit to the emergency department in the colonoscopy arm was 5.6 
adverse events per 1,000 individuals (95% CI 4.4–6.8) in the 70–74 age group and 10.3 
adverse events per 1,000 individuals (95% CI 8.6–11.1) in the 75–79 group. The increased 
risk for each individual adverse event was low (less than 2 cases per 1,000 persons), except 
for arrhythmia, with an excess risk of 2.4 cases per 1,000 individuals (95% CI 1.6–3.2) in 
the 70–74 age group and of 5.5 cases per 1,000 individuals (95% CI 4.4–6.9) in the 75–79 
age group (Table 2).
Discussion
We estimated that screening colonoscopy reduces the eight-year risk of CRC from 
approximately 2.6% to 2.2% in beneficiaries aged 70 to 74 years, and from 3.0% to 2.8% in 
those aged 75 to 79 years. The excess risk of serious adverse events after colonoscopy was 
small, especially among younger beneficiaries.

 Our findings are consistent with the USPSTF recommendations for routine screening 
through age 75, followed by individualized decisions afterwards (17). Because the ongoing 
trials (3–5) do not include the older age groups (eTable 1), our study provides helpful 
information for benefit-risk analyses. Our estimates of the impact of screening 
colonoscopies on CRC incidence and complication rates in older persons are particularly 
important in view of current policies to increase screening uptake: the Healthy People 2020 
goal is a 70 percent CRC screening rate (34).
Based on Medicare surveillance patterns (eFigure 5 in the Supplementary material), our 
screening colonoscopy arm corresponds approximately to the strategy “receive a screening 
colonoscopy; if a polyp is detected, repeat at 3 or 5 years; if no polyp is detected, repeat at 5 
years or later”. Our estimates are not directly comparable with previous observational 
analyses of colonoscopy and CRC incidence which were based on comparisons that are less 
relevant for decision-making (e.g., “receiving a negative colonoscopy” or “polypectomy” 
versus “no lower endoscopy” (35)), were mostly restricted to younger age groups, and did 
not estimate absolute risks (36–40).
The follow-up of our study—25% of beneficiaries were followed more than 5.5 years—may 
be insufficient to detect the full benefits of screening colonoscopy, although our estimates 
suggest a greater CRC absolute risk reduction at 8 years than that found by the screening 
sigmoidoscopy trials (11,12,14,15), especially in the younger age group. Though the 
absence of cause of death information in Medicare data precludes the evaluation of CRC-
specific mortality, we would expect that both CRC-mortality and morbidity be improved in 
the screening arm. In addition to the lower CRC incidence, over half of the CRC cases 
detected through screening colonoscopy were stage 0 or I, compared with a third of interval 
cancers. Because Stages 0 and I have an excellent prognosis and do not require adjuvant 
chemotherapy, earlier detection by screening contributes to better cancer-specific survival 
and better quality of life. A concern of population-based cancer screening programs is 
overdiagnosis (41,42) and treatment of indolent cancer that would never become 
symptomatic. Screening colonoscopy, however, identifies and removes precancerous lesions, 
which do not require further treatment, and is a low risk procedure (as opposed to, for 
example, removing a pulmonary node detected in screening low-dose CT scan). Therefore, 
screening colonoscopy might face fewer challenges than other screening programs.
Like in any observational study, our estimates might be confounded by unmeasured risk 
factors for CRC. However, in this case, the are several reasons to doubt that substantial 
confounding exists. First, our estimates are consistent with those of observational analyses 
of three sigmoidoscopy randomized trials (11,12,14) that ignored randomization by 
comparing the CRC incidence between the control group with the non-compliers in the 
intervention group. The three trials consistently found no differences in CRC incidence, 
which suggests little, if any, confounding, that is, CRC risk factors seem to be little 
associated with the reasons why individuals decide to undergo CRC screening. Second, 
previous observational studies have found very little impact on the effect estimates after 
adjustment for potential confounders (39,43,44). Third, our FOBT estimates in the younger 
age group were compatible with the benchmark provided by FOBT trials (7,45), which 
further supports the validity of our approach to emulate a CRC screening randomized trial.

 Sensitivity analyses (46) confirm that the conclusions of our study would not change under 
realistic scenarios of unmeasured confounding (eFigure 6). In contrast, as in the 
observational analyses of the sigmoidoscopy trials, we suspect substantial confounding 
exists for the effect of CRC screening on all-cause mortality (16) (eFigure 7 in the 
Supplementary material), for which unmeasured lifestyle prognostic factors such as cigarette 
smoking are more relevant.
Further, we included only users of Medicare preventive services to reduce confounding and 
to increase the specificity of our classification of colonoscopies as screening tests. This 
selection might reduce external validity, as it happens in any clinical trial that applies a set of 
eligibility criteria, but increases internal validity by reducing the differences between arms 
with respect to measured variables (data not shown) and therefore probably with respect to 
unmeasured variables too. A sensitivity analysis without this selection yields the same effect 
estimate, but an implausibly high cancer prevalence (eFigure 8), possibly due to the 
inclusion of colonoscopies conducted for diagnostic purposes, which supports our selection 
as a strategy to reduce misclassification of screening colonoscopies. Thus the slightly higher 
prevalence of CRC at the baseline colonoscopy in our study compared with that reported in 
two ongoing randomized trials (3,47) and several observational studies (48–50), likely 
results from a higher prevalence of asymptomatic CRC in our older population rather than 
from misclassification of diagnostic colonoscopies. We also found a higher baseline 
prevalence of CRC in our FOBT arm (eFigure 3 in the Supplementary material) than in 
published FOBT studies (7,45), and FOBT is rarely used for reasons other than screening.
In summary, we provide precise estimates of the effectiveness and safety of screening 
colonoscopy in individuals aged 70 and older, an underrepresented population in randomized 
trials. Our findings suggest a modest benefit of screening colonoscopy for the prevention of 
CRC in persons aged 70–74 years, and a smaller (if any) benefit in older individuals. The 
risk of adverse events was low in both age groups. Our findings can assist patients, 
physicians, and policy makers make informed decisions about CRC screening.
