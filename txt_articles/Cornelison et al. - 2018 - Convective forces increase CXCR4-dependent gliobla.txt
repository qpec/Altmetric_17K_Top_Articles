dependent glioblastoma cell 
invasion in GL261 murine model

Glioblastoma is the most common and malignant form of brain cancer. Its invasive nature limits 
treatment efficacy and promotes inevitable recurrence. Previous in vitro studies showed that interstitial 
fluid flow, a factor characteristically increased in cancer, increases glioma cell invasion through CXCR4-
CXCL12 signaling. It is currently unknown if these effects translate in vivo. We used the therapeutic 
technique of convection enhanced delivery (CED) to test if convective flow alters glioma invasion in 
a syngeneic GL261 mouse model of glioblastoma. The GL261 cell line was flow responsive in vitro, 
dependent upon CXCR4 and CXCL12. Additionally, transplanting GL261 intracranially increased the 
populations of CXCR4+ and double positive cells versus 3D culture. We showed that inducing convective 
flow within implanted tumors indeed increased invasion over untreated controls, and administering 
the CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 (5 mg/kg) effectively eliminated this response. These data confirm 
that glioma invasion is stimulated by convective flow in vivo and depends on CXCR4 signaling. We 
also showed that expression of CXCR4 and CXCL12 is increased in patients having received standard 
therapy, when CED might be elected. Hence, targeting flow-stimulated invasion may prove beneficial 
as a second line of therapy, particularly in patients chosen to receive treatment by convection enhanced 
delivery.
Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive form of brain cancer and is characterized by invasion into the sur-
rounding brain or parenchyma1,2. This invasiveness causes diffuse borders between the tumor and parenchyma, 
preventing effective resection of all malignant cells. Additionally, because tumor cells that have invaded into 
the surrounding healthy tissue are increasingly resistant to radiation and chemotherapy, GBM always recurs3,4. 
Therefore, understanding and targeting molecules that regulate glioma cell invasion has therapeutic implications 
in the treatment of GBM. One signaling axis known to regulate GBM invasion is the CXCR4-CXCL12 pathway. 
While a potent driver of GBM invasion in static conditions, CXCR4- and CXCL12-mediated invasion in GBM 
can be enhanced by interstitial fluid flow through a mechanism known as autologous chemotaxis5–7. Interstitial 
flow is the movement of fluid from the vasculature throughout the interstitial tissue space toward draining lym-
phatics or clearance pathways. This process normally maintains tissue homeostasis, but the leaky nascent vascu-
lature and increased waste production in solid cancers can dramatically increase interstitial pressure and, in turn, 
interstitial flow1,8.
We previously showed that rat and human GBM cell lines respond to flow in vitro by increasing inva-
sion6,7. Furthermore, regions of high flow (identified by arterial extravasation of Evans blue) correlated with 
regions of invasion for cell lines as well as patient-derived glioma stem cells6,7. In vitro, flow-stimulated inva-
sion was mitigated by both blocking the receptor CXCR4 as well as saturating the ligand CXCL12, suggesting 
this chemokine-receptor pathway plays a key role in glioma cell flow response. It remains unknown, however, 
if interstitial flow directly stimulates cancer cell invasion in vivo and if CXCR4 signaling is similarly implicated. 
Answering these questions requires a technique to induce convective forces within the tumor in situ at a time 
when heightened interstitial flow may not be fully established on its own.
Convection enhanced delivery (CED) is an experimental technique used in the clinic to overcome high 
intra-tumoral pressure and increase drug distribution via local infusion9,10. A blunt needle is placed into the 
center of the tumor, and a drug-laden solution is infused to enhance drug transport. In essence, CED drives 
convective flow through the interstitial spaces in the tumor, mimicking interstitial fluid flow. We used CED in

invasion in vivo and examine the dependence of this response on CXCR4 signaling.
Results
GL261 exhibit flow-stimulated invasion in vitro in a CXCR4-dependent manner. 
Prior to in 
vivo assessment, the flow response of GL261 cells was examined in vitro using a 3D tissue culture insert model 
(Fig. 1A)6. Under static conditions, 0.1–0.2% of GL261 invaded beyond the semi-permeable membrane (Fig. 1B). 
The addition of gravity-driven flow significantly increased the percent of cells invading by approximately 1.6 
fold (t(4) = 5.931, n = 5, p < 0.01). This flow-stimulated increase in invasion could be mitigated by blocking 
CXCR4 using 10 µM AMD3100, a small molecule inhibitor of CXCR4 (t(4) = 2.722, n = 5, p > 0.1). Similar 
results were observed for saturating the cultures (in the gel and on both sides of the tissue culture insert) with 
100 nM CXCL12 to eliminate cytokine gradient formation under flow. Ligand saturation significantly decreased 
the effects of flow (t(4) = 3.545, n = 5, p < 0.05) (Fig. 1C), returning invasion to static levels (t(3) = 2.293, n = 4, 
p > 0.1). Hence, the flow response of GL261 aligns with the previously proposed mechanism of CXCR4-CXCL12 
autologous chemotaxis1.

CXCR4+ and CXCR4+CXCL12+ populations are enriched within in vivo tumor samples. 
Because 
the significance of targeting autologous chemotaxis and flow-stimulated invasion may be influenced by expres-
sion levels, we used flow cytometry to characterize GL261 expression of CXCR4 and CXCL12 in different envi-
ronments. The dimensionality of culture significantly impacted receptor and ligand expression. In 2D, few cells 
expressed the receptor, ligand, or both (Fig. 2). Embedding the cells in 3D hydrogels significantly increased the 
number of CXCR4+ cells to 8.13 ± 1.71% compared to 1.83 ± 0.25% in 2D culture (t(3) = 3.389, n = 4, p < 0.05) 
(Fig. 2A). Similar effects were observed on the CXCL12 population (t(3) = 4.14, n = 4, p < 0.05) (Fig. 2B). 
While there was no difference in the percentage of CXCR4+CXCL12+ cells between 2D and 3D in vitro culture 
(Fig. 2C), this double positive population increased from 1.66 ± 0.72% in 3D to 3.38 ± 0.49% of total cells in vivo

(t(8) = 2.767, n = 6 in vivo and n = 4 in vitro, p < 0.05 compared to 3D). These effects were further amplified for 
CXCR4 single expression, dramatically increasing from 8.13 ± 1.71% in 3D to 65.4 ± 5.19% in vivo (t(8) = 8.653, 
n = 6 in vivo and n = 4 in vitro, p < 0.0001 compared to 3D). Expression of CXCL12 in vivo was similar to that 
in 3D culture. Given the role of this receptor/ligand pair on flow response, an enrichment in CXCR4+ and 
CXCR4+CXCL12+ populations may increase the potential for flow-stimulated invasion in vivo.
Glioma invasion in vivo is enhanced by convective flow. 
We examined the effects of convective forces 
on glioma cell invasion in vivo using the therapeutic technique of convection enhanced delivery (CED). A car-
toon of the process is shown in Fig. 3A, and an experimental timeline in Fig. 3B. First, magnetic resonance imag-
ing was used to verify the ability to induce fluid convection using CED. A gadolinium contrast agent conjugated 
to albumin (Galbumin, 25 mg/mL) was infused into the tumors at day 7 at a rate of 1 µL/min. Immediately follow-
ing CED, the mice were transferred to a 7 Tesla MRI machine to visualize changes in galbumin distribution over 
time. T2-weighted images were used to identify the location of the tumors (Suppl. Fig. 2A). Using T1-weighted

imaging, the signal intensity of intra-tumoral galbumin was observed to change over a 30 minute period, indica-
tive of contrast agent flux (Suppl. Fig. 2B). Five representative slices are shown for one mouse.
Following verification that CED does induce convective flow, a second cohort of mice was used to examine 
invasion. Convective flow was again induced seven days after tumor inoculation at 1 µL/min, and invasion was 
assessed two days later using immunohistochemistry. Representative images are shown in Fig. 3C–J, with inva-
sion quantification summarized in Fig. 3K. Untreated (static) tumors had approximately 5.75 ± 0.938 cells/mm2 
invaded beyond the tumor border into the surrounding tissue. Following CED, the number of invading cells sig-
nificantly increased to 12.2 ± 2.4 cells/mm2 (Fig. 3E,F,K) (t(12) = 2.433, n = 7, p < 0.05). This greater than 2-fold 
increase to invasion in vivo was even more pronounced than the in vitro results (1.6-fold change under flow).
Effects of flow in vivo are mediated through CXCR4. 
Given the ability of CXCR4 antagonism to reduce 
flow-stimulated invasion in vitro, we examined the effects of administering the CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 
(5 mg/kg) systemically with and without CED11. This drug has been delivered to in vivo glioma models previously 
and shows some clinical potential as a secondary therapy12–14. In the absence of convective flow (Fig. 3G,H,K), 
AMD3100 did not significantly alter glioma cell invasion compared to untreated controls at 5.12 ± 0.490 cells/
mm2 (t(12) = 0.6008, n = 7, p > 0.1). However, treating mice with AMD3100 (Fig. 3I,J,K) significantly reduced 
the effects of CED on invasion compared to CED alone (t(12) = 3.026, n = 7, p < 0.05). This treatment regimen 
effectively maintained the number of cells invading beyond the tumor border to 4.38 ± 0.731 cells/mm2, not sig-
nificantly different from that of untreated, static controls. Hence, dosing with AMD3100 prior to convection was 
able to mitigate flow-stimulated increases to glioma cell invasion. This decrease in flow-stimulated invasion with 
AMD3100 treatment was also associated with a decrease in CXCR4 phosphorylation, an indicator of receptor 
stimulation and signaling6. Untreated tumors exhibited moderate immunoreactivity for phosphorylated CXCR4 
(Fig. 4A), indicating that this signaling pathway is basally active within GL261 tumors in vivo. Applying flow 
via CED markedly increased pCXCR4 immunoreactivity in vivo (Fig. 4B), consistent with prior in vitro results6. 
Administering AMD3100 prior to CED effectively attenuated increased pCXCR4 staining, observably decreasing 
immunoreactivity below that of untreated controls (Fig. 4C). Hence, interstitial flow is indeed able to stimulate 
invasion of glioma cells in vivo mediated at least in part through CXCR4 signaling.
CXCR4 and CXCL12 are increased in patient samples obtained after radiation and chemother-
apy. 
Convection enhanced delivery is experimentally used in the clinic to deliver a secondary therapy, mean-
ing this technique is implemented after standard radiation therapy and chemotherapy. In previous publications,

it was shown that treatment with radiation therapy, a common therapeutic intervention against glioblastoma, 
led to increases in flow-stimulated invasion in vitro7. It was postulated that this effect was due to increases in 
both CXCR4 and CXCL12 in glioma cells. It is therefore important to consider how standard therapy, including 
both radiation therapy and chemotherapy, may affect the propensity for flow-stimulated cancer cell invasion. 
We used immunofluorescence staining to quantify expression of CXCR4 and CXCL12 in tissue samples from 
patients diagnosed with glioblastoma, with one cohort comprising samples taken prior to therapy and one with 
samples taken after therapy (Fig. 5). Statistics for the entire and subdivided patient cohorts are summarized in 
Table 1. Samples were analyzed within the tumor regions of resected samples. Pre-therapy samples showed mod-
est expression of both CXCR4 and CXCL12 (Fig. 5A–C) while samples obtained after therapy exhibited a marked 
increase in the staining intensity for both markers (Fig. 5D–F). This effect was quantified using image analysis and 
integrated density measurements (Fig. 5G), confirming that post-therapy samples had significantly increased flu-
orescence intensity for both CXCR4 (p < 0.01) and CXCL12 (p < 0.05) compared to pre-therapy samples (df = 14; 
n = 9 pre-therapy and n = 7 post-therapy).
Discussion
Interstitial fluid flow is a key component of normal physiology; however, emerging evidence suggests that this 
biomechanical force may also contribute to cancer malignancy. The phenomenon is studied most extensively in 
breast cancer, where interstitial flow influences both the direction and magnitude of cancer cell migration and 
promotes activation of, and matrix remodeling by, relevant stromal cells5,15–18. Regarding GBM, paths of brain 
tumor dissemination correlate with bulk fluid pathways19. Additionally, we now know that interstitial fluid flow 
pathways within GBM in mice are complex and heterogeneous, indicating a need for greater understanding of 
the impacts on cellular invasion20. Only recently we showed that interstitial flow indeed increases invasion of 
both murine and human glioma cells in vitro through the chemokine receptor-ligand pair CXCR4-CXCL126,7. 
Nonetheless, the causal effects of flow on cancer cell invasion have only been studied through in vitro experi-
ments, and previous in vivo data simply showed correlation. The goal of the current study was to determine if 
interstitial fluid flow directly stimulates glioma cell invasion in the brain.
The therapeutic technique of convection-enhanced delivery (CED) was used to induce convective flow within 
brain tumors in situ, as evidenced by rapid elimination of an infused contrast agent. CED is a catheter-based 
method used to by-pass suspected transport limitations between the vasculature and the high-pressure tumor 
bulk. This technique has been used experimentally and tested clinically for enhancing local perfusion of chemo-
therapeutics or other drugs in the treatment of GBM10,21–23. Here, we found that applying CED at 1 µL/min – the 
lower end of the clinically-relevant range (1–5 µL/min)9 – significantly increased GL261 cell invasion compared 
to untreated controls at two days after flow application. This greater than 2-fold differential in invasion was more 
pronounced than in comparative in vitro experiments, suggesting an enhanced contribution of flow-stimulated 
invasion in vivo. Because flow response can be mediated through the receptor CXCR4 in vitro, and the percentage 
of CXCR4+ GL261 cells dramatically increased upon implantation (8.13 ± 1.71% in 3D vs. 65.4 ± 5.19% in vivo; 
p < 0.0001), we investigated the involvement of CXCR4 signaling on in vivo flow-mediation invasion.
Even in the absence of applying CED, we noted moderate immunoreactivity in the tumor bulk for phosphoryl-
ated CXCR4, a known marker of CXCR4 activation and signaling. Phosphorylation of CXCR4 occurs primarily 
due to binding with its ligand, CXCL12, and can lead to myriad signaling events24. Convective flow increased 
pCXCR4 immunoreactivity both in the tumor and the surrounding brain tissue, suggesting the technique of 
CED may increase chemokine signaling throughout the tumor microenvironment. CXCR4 activation leads to 
tyrosine-mediated phosphorylation of downstream proteins, including focal adhesion kinases (FAK), and sub-
sequently increased migration25,26. Interstitial flow has been shown to localize pFAK in the flow direction, indic-
ative of directional migration or cellular chemotaxis5,6. There may be further implications of increased CXCR4 
phosphorylation in the surrounding brain since activation of CXCR4 in glia can lead to increased neurotoxicity 
and pro-tumor phenotypes27,28. Additional studies are required to examine if the negative implications of CED 
(increased invasion and CXCR4 phosphorylation) are counter-balanced by the cytotoxic effects of an infused 
drug.
Because glioma cells themselves can express CXCL12, it has been proposed that one way interstitial flow 
stimulates invasion is through a mechanism termed “autologous chemotaxis”1,5,6,29. Essentially, in vitro and in 
silico experiments suggest that fluid flow creates an anisotropic ligand gradient around individual cells, pushing 
the chemokine downstream of the cell where it binds to the extracellular matrix and stimulates migration in the 
direction of flow. We previously showed using an agent based model that heterogeneous populations of glioma 
cells are exquisitely sensitive to small changes in CXCR4 and CXCL12 co-expressing cells, leading to enhanced 
flow response via this autologous chemotaxis mechanism7. While this previous analysis used expression data 
from cells in vitro, here we found a drastic increase in the populations of CXCR4+ and double positive cells 
upon transplantation, further increasing the implications of flow-stimulated invasion in vivo. Although CXCL12 
expression did not vary significantly between 3D culture and in vivo (and has been shown not to vary in response 
to flow6), CXCL12 is produced by other cells, such as endothelial cells and astrocytes, and is also present in the 
blood30–32. Therefore, ligand availability likely increases upon implantation independent of tumor cell expression.
Using the small molecule antagonist AMD3100, we showed that CXCR4 signaling is likely a primary mech-
anism by which the GL261 cell line responds to flow. Nonetheless, patient-derived glioma stem cells display 
heterogeneity in their dependence on CXCR4 versus other receptor-mediated responses to flow such as CD44 
mechanotransduction7. Thus, supplementation with other targeted therapies delivered via CED may be advan-
tageous. Inhibition of either CD44 or integrin receptors also limits glioma invasion in vivo and in vitro33–36. 
Interestingly, both of these mechanoreceptors are linked with CXCR4 as co-receptors, acting to either increase 
affinity to CXCL12 or mediate downstream signaling events37–39. While the antagonist AMD3100 specifically 
inhibits activation of CXCR4 by displacing binding with the N-terminal of CXCL1240,41, the binding pocket of

CXCL12 overlaps with that of some CXCR4 co-receptors42,43. Therefore, AMD3100 may also act to inhibit these 
other mechanisms. Blocking CXCR4 did not eliminate invasion entirely under static or flow conditions, however. 
Cancer cell invasion is a multifaceted process regulated by many mechanisms, as previously reviewed by Sayegh 
et al.44. Thus, mechanisms other than CXCR4-mediated flow response may concurrently enhance infiltration into 
the brain such that targeting of many pathways may be required to eliminate invasion.
While not examined here, it is important to consider that CED is most often used experimentally after stand-
ard radiation and chemotherapy and in the presence of the tumor bulk. Previous work demonstrated that radia-
tion induces tumor invasiveness by increasing tumor-derived CXCL12 at the invasive tumor border, which may 
enhance the potential for CXCR4 signaling45. Furthermore, irradiation of GL261 cells increases CXCR4 expres-
sion in a dose-dependent manner46. Using immunofluorescence staining of patient samples, we observed that 
tissue from patients who had received therapy showed increased immunoreactivity for both CXCR4 and CXCL12 
compared to samples obtained from patients prior to therapy. These observations suggest that the increased 
expression found in mouse cells after therapy may also hold true in humans. Furthermore, CXCR4 is also a 
purported marker of glioma stem cells47 and so increases to CXCR4 expression due to radiation may not only 
increase the potential for flow-stimulated invasion but also increase malignancy via cancer stem cell expansion.
Ultimately, GBM therapies and delivery strategies have the potential to manipulate both cellular flow response 
and interstitial fluid pathways and velocities in GBM. The idea that therapy may alter GBM response – while not 
a new idea – has never been explored in the context of interstitial flow regulation. Therapeutic agents such as 
bevacizumab and dexamethasone, which act to normalize blood vessels and reduce inflammation, and delivery 
regimes such as CED could either increase or decrease interstitial flow due to alterations in intratumoral pres-
sure48,49. While CED is not a poor choice for drug delivery in GBM, our data imply that therapeutic use of CED 
may benefit from supplementation with CXCR4 blockade to prevent undesirable consequences on cancer cell 
invasion. This work offers a first perspective on the unstudied effects of flow-altering delivery strategies and their 
potential to simultaneously treat and worsen GBM in the absence of inhibiting flow-stimulated mechanisms of 
invasion.
Materials and Methods
In vitro invasion assays. 
GL261 invasion was assessed in vitro using 12-well (Millipore PI8P01250) or 
96-well (Corning 3374) tissue culture inserts1. Cancer cells were seeded at 1 ×
 106 cells/mL in 3D hydrogels com-
prising 1.5% rat tail collagen (Corning 354236), 0.2% thiolated hyaluronic acid (Glycosil®; ESI Bio GS220), and 
0.1% PEGDA (ESI Bio GS3006). After 20 minutes of gelation, 15 μ
L of fresh medium was applied on top of the 
gels. Flow was initiated three hours later using serum-free medium, and cultures were maintained overnight. 
AMD3100 was used at 10 μ
M (Sigma A5602) to block the receptor CXCR4 or an excess of 100 nM CXCL12 
(Peprotech 300–28 A) was added to prevent chemokine gradient formation. The membranes were then fixed in 
4% paraformaldehyde and counterstained using DAPI (Thermo Fisher D1306). An EVOS FL fluorescence micro-
scope was used to acquire 20X images of the porous membrane bottom at five random locations for each sample50. 
The number of invading cells was manually counted for each technical replicate for n ≥
 4 biological replicates.
Lentiviral transfection and in vivo tumor model. 
All animal procedures were approved by the 
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUC) at the University of Virginia and Virginia Polytechnic 
Institute and State University. Lentivirus conferring expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) under puro-
mycin antibiotic selection was a generous gift from the laboratory of Dr. Kevin Janes. Murine GL261 were serially 
transfected with GFP lentivirus and purified by selection with 2 μ
g/mL puromycin (Thermo Fisher A1113803). 
For in vivo tumor studies, a burr hole was drilled into the skull of anesthetized C57BL/6 mice (5–8 weeks; Harlan 
Laboratories) at coordinates −
2, +2, −
2.2 (AP, ML, DV) from bregma. 100,000 GFP+ GL261 cells were inocu-
lated in 5 μ
L at 1 μ
L/min, and the bur hole was sealed with bone wax. Ketoprofen was administered at 2 mg/kg for 
48 hours to manage pain. One week later, the inoculation site was re-exposed, and a blunt-end 26 gauge needle 
was used to infuse 10 μ
L of 1 mg/mL biotinylated dextran amine at 1 μ
L/min. Ketoprofen was again administered 
at 2 mg/kg for 48 hours to manage pain.
Flow cytometry. 
Triplicate wells of 100,000 GL261 cells were cultured in serum-containing medium over-
night, either on 2D tissue culture plastic or in 3D hydrogels, as described above. The following day, cells were 
cultured with 10 μ
M Brefeldin A in serum-free medium for 6 hours, harvested, pooled, and subjected to anti-
body labeling7. To assess expression in vivo, mice were inoculated with GFP + tumor cells as above, and 14 days

post-implantation mice were treated with 0.25 mg Brefeldin A for 6 hours via intraperitoneal injection51. The 
brains were then dissociated for analysis. Briefly, the ipsilateral cortical hemisphere was isolated into HBSS and 
slightly trimmed to reduce the number of non-cancerous cells. The tissue was minced using a scalpel blade, 
incubated in 5 mL of ACK RBC lysis buffer for 3–5 minutes at room temperature, and centrifuged at 1100 rpm 
for 5 minutes. An approximately equal volume of 1.5 mg/mL Liberase DL (Sigma 5466202001) was then added to 
digest the tissue for 30 minutes on a rocker at 37 °C, pipetting up and down to ensure complete digestion.
The tissue slurry was then strained through a 40 µm cell strainer followed by 35 mL of HBSS. This solution was 
centrifuged at 1100 rpm for 5 minutes, and the isolated cells were resuspended and counted for flow cytometry. 
Primary-conjugated antibodies were used to stain for CXCR4 (eBiosciences 17-9991-80) and CXCL12 (R&D 
IC350C), along with appropriate isotype controls. Dead cells were stained using LIVE/DEAD® Fixable Green 
Dead cell stain kit (Thermo Fisher L23101). Stained samples were run on a Millipore Guava flow cytometer for a 
minimum of 50,000 events, and the data was analyzed using Incyte software. A flow chart of the gating strategy 
is shown in Supplemental Fig. 1. For data analysis, plots were gated based on data from single stained controls. 
In vivo samples were further gated on GFP+ cells to assess only GL261. All numbers are shown as percent of live, 
single cells.
Magnetic resonance imaging. 
Animals were anesthetized and placed in a 7 T Clinscan small animal 
MRI (Bruker/Siemens, Ettlingen, Germany) equipped with a 30-mm head coil. A T2-weighted image was taken 
through the head with the following parameters: repetition time (TR) = 5500 ms, echo time (TE) = 65 ms, field 
of view (FOV) = 20 mm ×
 20 mm with a 192 ×
 192 matrix, slice thickness = 0.5 mm, number of slices = 30, two 
averages per phase-encode step requiring a total acquisition time of about 5 min per mouse. For T1-weighted 
MRI, a 33-Gauge, blunt-end catheter was placed into the same coordinates for tumor implantation, and 10 μ
L 
of 25 mg/mL Glowing Galbumin (BioPAL Inc.) was infused at a rate of 1 μ
L/min. Following an initial image, T1 
images were acquired approximately 30 minutes, 1 hour, and 24 hours post-infusion according to the following 
parameters: TR = 500 ms, TE = 11 ms, FOV = 20 mm ×
 20 mm with a 192 ×
 192 matrix, slice thickness = 0.7 mm, 
number of slices = 22, two averages per phase-encode step requiring a total acquisition time of about 3 min per 
mouse. Contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images at time t = 0 were subtracted from images at t = 30 minutes to 
generate a difference heat map and visualize changes in contrast intensity over time.
Tissue harvest and immunohistochemistry. 
Two days after convection enhanced delivery, 
tumor-bearing mice were administered Euthasol solution and intracardially perfused with phosphate buffered 
saline (PBS). Brain tissue was quickly harvested and bisected coronally at the center of the injection site. The 
brains were fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde, cryopreserved in 30% sucrose, and sectioned at 12 µm 
using a Leica 1950 cryostat. Tissue sections were blocked in 3% serum and 0.03% Triton X-100 in PBS for 1 hour, 
then were incubated overnight at 4 °C with rabbit anti-pCXCR4 (Abcam ab74012) diluted in blocker buffer. The 
samples were washed three times with PBS and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature with goat anti-rabbit 
660 diluted in blocking buffer. After washing again, the nuclei were counterstained using DAPI (Thermo Fisher).
In vivo invasion quantification. 
Fluorescently labeled sections were imaged using an EVOS FL micro-
scope. Five images were randomly taken around the tumor periphery for each of three sections 120 μ
m apart 
for each animal. The tumor border was identified based on GFP+ GL261 and nuclear staining, and a blinded 
investigator counted the number of GFP+ tumor cells beyond the border for each image. Data are presented as 
the number of invading cells per mm2 of tissue.
Patient sample collection and immunohistochemistry. 
All procedures involving human participants 
were performed in accordance with the ethical standards of the Institutional Review Board of the University of 
Virginia and the 1964 Helsinki declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards. The tissue 
samples were initially banked with informed patient consent. The samples in this study were accessed through 
the University of Virginia Biorepository and Tissue Research Facility selected by a neuropathologist (Dr. James 
W. Mandell, UVA) based on a definitive diagnosis of GBM (astrocytoma, WHO grade IV) who had completed 
tumor resections at the University of Virginia between 2010 and 2013. Samples were de-identified and processed 
to identify ones containing primarily tumor bulk. Descriptive statistics and survival information for the patient 
cohort are presented in Table 1.
For quantitative analysis, we started with ten samples taken prior to therapy and seven taken after standard 
of care therapy. The eight micron sections were deparaffinized in xylene followed by four graded washed with an 
increasing ratio of ethanol:water to achieve rehydration. The samples were then subjected to boiling in citrate 
buffer for 30 minutes for antigen retrieval. The samples were blocked in 3% donkey serum and 0.03% Triton X-100 
for 1 hr at room temperature, then primary antibodies against CXCR4 (Sigma GW21075) and CXCL12 (Abcam 
ab18919) were added overnight at 4 °C. The following day, the samples were washed three times in 1X PBS, treated 
with donkey anti-rabbit 488 and donkey anti-chicken 647 for 1 hr at room temperature, then washed again. 
Nuclei were counterstained using DAPI (Thermo D3571), and the samples were mounted in Fluoromount-G 
(SouthernBiotech) prior to coverslipping. Tissue samples were scanned at 10X using an EVOS-FL Auto2. Five 
regions were randomly selected from each sample. Thresholding was performed for each image in ImageJ prior 
to measuring the integrated densities, used to obtain an average integrated density for each sample. Grubb’s test 
was then used to identify statistical outliers. For both CXCR4 and CXCL12 analyses, one pre-therapy sample was 
identified as an outlier and was therefore excluded from each.

Statistics. 
Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was performed for comparisons of more than two groups, using 
a significance level of 0.05. If significance was identified within the dataset, t-tests were performed to determine 
significance between individual groups. Ratio paired t-tests were used to analyze all in vitro data; unpaired t-tests 
were used to compare in vitro data to in vivo flow cytometry data; and unpaired student’s t-tests were used to 
compare experimental groups for in vivo invasion and patient sample quantification. All graphed and reported 
descriptive statistics in the text are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean, unless otherwise stated. 
Inferential statistics are reported as “(degrees of freedom) = value, n per group, p value” so that effect size can be 
determined from our reported data.
