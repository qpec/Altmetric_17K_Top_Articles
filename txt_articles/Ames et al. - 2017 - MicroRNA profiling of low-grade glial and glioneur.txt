Low-grade (WHO I-II) gliomas and glioneuronal tumors represent the most frequent primary tumors of the central
nervous system in children. They often have a good prognosis following total resection, however they can create
many neurological complications due to mass effect, and may be difficult to resect depending on anatomic
location. MicroRNAs have been identified as molecular regulators of protein expression/translation that can
repress multiple mRNAs concurrently through base pairing, and have an important role in cancer, including brain
tumors. Using the NanoString digital counting system, we analyzed the expression levels of 800 microRNAs in
nine low-grade glial and glioneuronal tumor types (n = 45). A set of 61 of these microRNAs were differentially
expressed in tumors compared with the brain, and several showed levels varying by tumor type. The expression
differences were more accentuated in subependymal giant cell astrocytoma, compared with other groups, and
demonstrated the highest degree of microRNA repression validated by RT-PCR, including miR-129-2-3p,
miR-219-5p, miR-338-3p, miR-487b, miR-885-5p, and miR-323a-3p. Conversely, miR-4488 and miR-1246 were
overexpressed in dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumors compared with the brain and other tumors. The
cluster 14q32.31 member miR-487b was variably under-expressed in pediatric glioma lines compared with
human neural stem cells. Overexpression of miR-487b in a pediatric glioma cell line (KNS42) using lentiviral
vectors led to a decrease in colony formation in soft agar (30%) (Po0.05), and decreased expression of known
predicted targets PROM1 and Nestin (but not WNT5A). miR-487b overexpression had no significant effect on cell
growth, proliferation, sensitivity to temozolomide, migration, or invasion. In summary, microRNA regulation
appears to have a role in the biology of glial and glioneuronal tumor subtypes, a finding that deserves further
investigation.

The category of low-grade gliomas is composed of a
diverse group of slow growing tumors that primarily
arise in childhood and young adulthood. The related
category of glioneuronal tumors demonstrate similar
demographics,
although
they
are
more
hetero-
geneous with regard to specific subtypes, and can
have a variable proportion of glial and neuronal
components. Both of these tumor types are initially
treated by surgery and are associated with a good
prognosis, although they may be associated with
seizures and deleterious mass effects. Association
with genetic syndromes such as neurofibromatosis
and
tuberous
sclerosis
may
be
present
and
malignant transformation is very rare. With these
characteristics, low-grade gliomas and glioneuronal
tumors represent a diverse, yet genetically stable,
pool from which to identify potential molecular
targets.
Our understanding of the biology of pediatric low-
grade
glioma

advances in molecular genetics. The application of

fusions, as well as other genetic rearrangements
and mutations lead to downstream activation of
signaling
pathways,
particularly
the
mitogen-
activated protein kinase pathway.2 More recently,
comprehensive sequencing studies have documen-
ted genetic hits in mitogen-activated protein kinase
pathway components in essentially 100% of pilocy-
tic astrocytomas.6 In patients with neurofibromatosis
type 1, pilocytic astrocytomas develop homozygous
mutations in the NF1 gene, also leading to MAPK
pathway activation. Another relevant signaling path-
way, involving the mammalian target of rapamycin
(mTOR), is frequently activated in pediatric low-
grade glioma,7,8 and represents the key molecular
property of subependymal giant cell astrocytoma, a
tumor
frequently
developing

the
setting
of
tuberous sclerosis, and characterized by inactivation
of TSC1 or TSC2. Other pediatric low-grade glioma
subsets
have
different
alterations,
for
example,
partial duplication of the transcription factor MYBL1
with truncated transcript, intragenic duplications of
the tyrosine kinase domain in the FGFR1 gene, and
MYB rearrangements in diffuse pediatric low-grade
gliomas.9,10
A role for a variety of noncoding ribonucleic acid
molecules (RNAs), particularly microRNAs (measur-
ing ~ 22 nucleotides in length), has been increasingly
documented in many normal and abnormal physio-
logic states, including cancer. MicroRNAs have been
identified as regulators of RNA transcription and
protein translation. Through this mechanism, multi-
ple mRNAs can be concurrently targeted through
base pairing. Tumor suppressors may be targeted
through microRNA upregulation, whereas oncogenes
may be increased in abundance by downregulation
of corresponding microRNAs. Of relevance to this
study, several microRNAs have been implicated in
gliomagenesis by prior studies (eg, miR-21, miR-7,
miR-181a/b, miR-221, and miR-22211–15), and also
regulate
signaling
pathways
in
diffuse
gliomas,
including glioblastoma.16,17 For example, PTEN, a
validated
tumor
suppressor
gene,
is
frequently
inactivated in diffuse gliomas, and may be regulated
by a number of microRNAs such as miR-21, miR-23a,
and miR-26a resulting in increased AKT/mTOR
activity.18,19 MicroRNAs may have more than one
target,
and
therefore
microRNA

subgroups
of
cancer
more
robustly than conventional mRNA profiling.20 Low-
grade pediatric gliomas lack the multiple overt
genomic
alterations
typical
of
higher
grade
tumors,21
and
therefore
microRNA
and
other
genetic/epigenetic mechanisms are likely to partici-
pate in their pathogenesis. Our work and that of
others has described differentially expressed micro-
RNAs in pilocytic astrocytomas compared with
normal
brain,
including
miR-21,
miR-124,
and
miR-129.22–25
Some
studies
have
also
reported

such
as

and

other low-grade glioma subtypes and glioneuronal
tumors
are

global microRNA expression in a series of low-grade
glioma and glioneuronal subtypes with the aim of
identifying biologic and clinically relevant targets.
Materials and methods
Tumor Samples
Cases of low-grade glioma or glioneuronal tumors
were queried in the pathology database of Johns
Hopkins Hospital. All available slides were reviewed
by two of the authors (FJR, MAV). Only sections with
460%
neoplastic
cellularity
were
selected
for
further
study.
Formalin-fixed
paraffin-embedded
sample rolls were collected in eppendorf tubes.
RNA extractions and quality analysis were per-
formed at the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Can-
cer Center Microarray Core Facility at the Johns
Hopkins University (Baltimore, MD, USA) using
the
miRNeasy
formalin-fixed
paraffin-embedded
tissue Kit (Qiagen). A total of 45 samples were
included in the study representing all categories of
low-grade, primarily pediatric, gliomas and glioneur-
onal tumors. Mean age was 15 years (range: 17
weeks to 57 years). Diffuse gliomas in adults and
NF1-associated tumors were excluded. Demographic
features of these tumors per case are outlined
in Supplementary Table 1. Tumor samples included
subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (n = 6), pilocy-
tic astrocytoma (n = 6), pleomorphic xanthoastrocy-
tomas
(n = 7),
gangliogliomas
(n = 6),
dysembry-
oplastic neuroepithelial tumor (n = 5), angiocentric
glioma (n = 3), pediatric oligodendroglioma (n = 3),
pediatric diffuse astrocytoma (n = 3), rosette-forming
glioneuronal tumor (n = 2), and non-neoplastic brain
controls (n = 4). All studies were performed using
established
ethical
guidelines
and
institutional
review board approval.
MicroRNA Profiling
NanoString technology was applied to formalin-
fixed paraffin-embedded tissues to quantify the
global expression of 800 microRNAs in nine types
of low-grade neoplasms of the brain. Raw data was
normalized using nSolver software (NanoString),
filtered for minimum expression threshold, and
log2 transformed before analysis. MeV software
(version 4.8.0) was used to generate unsupervised
hierarchical clusters following significance evalua-
tion via significant analysis of microarray. Results for
10 microRNAs of interest were further validated
using standard Taq-man

protocols and

CHLA-200 and SJ-GBM2 were provided by the
Children's Oncology Group Cell Culture and Xeno-
graft Repository banks. The pediatric glioma cell line
KNS42 was obtained from the Japan Cancer Research
Resources cell bank. Details of the various cell lines
is summarized in Supplementary Table 2. Cells were
cultured in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium/ F12
Ham medium (DMEM/F12) supplemented with 10%
heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. TrypLE express
enzyme
was
used
for
cell
dissociation.
Non-
neoplastic human neural stem cells have been
previously described30 and were grown in DMEM/
F12 supplemented with 20% B27 supplement, 5 µg/
ml heparin, 20 ng/ml EGF, and 20 ng/ml FGF2. All
culturing reagents were purchased from Thermo-
Fisher Scientific.
miRNA Overexpression and Inhibition
Lentiviral-based miRNA plasmids were obtained
from Biosettia, including expression plasmids pLV-
hsa-mir-487b (mir-487b) and pLV-mir-control (mir-
control),
inhibition
plasmids
pLV-hsa-mir-1246
locker (mir-1246 locker), and pLV-mir-locker control
(mir-locker). To produce lentiviruses, 293T cells
were transfected with miRNA plasmid and VSVG
packaging plasmids mixture using Lipofectamine
2000 (ThermoFisher Scientific). Lentiviral super-
natants were collected at 72 h post transfection,
and concentrated using Polyethylene glycol (PEG)
8000. Virus was resuspended in DMEM and kept
frozen at − 80 °C until needed. KNS42 cells were
infected with virus in the presence of polybrene
(5 μg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich). At 48 h later, infected cells
were selected with 1 μg/ml of puromycin (Sigma-
Aldrich, for expression plasmids) or 5 μg/ml of
Blastidin (ThermoFisher Scientific, for inhibition
plasmids) for 5 days to generate stable cell lines.
Target prediction was performed using TargetScan,
version 6.2.31
Cell Cycle Analysis
Cells were dissociated and fixed with 70% Ethanol at
4 °C overnight, then stained with Muse cell cycle
reagent for 30 min at room temperature and analyzed
with Muse flow cytometer (Millipore) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. Cell cycle data were
analyzed with FlowJo software.
Cell Growth and Cell Survival Assay
The CellTiter-Blue cell viability assay kit (Promega)
was used to count viable cells. Cells were seeded in
96 well plates at a density of 1000 cells per well in
growth media. Twenty microliters of CellTiter-Blue
reagent was added to 100 μl medium and incubated
for 1 h at 37 °C incubator. Fluorescence (560 nm Ex/
590 nm Em) was measured using TECAN plate
reader. For cell growth assay, relative cell numbers
were continuing measured for 5 days. For drug
treatment, cells were cultured in the media with
different doses of temozolomide (TMZ, Skellchem)
for 7 days, DMSO was used as control.
Quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction
(qRT-PCR)
Primers for miRNA were designed by using miRpri-
mer
software.32
Sequences

be
found
in
Supplementary Table 3, and small RNA RNU48
was
used
as
the
endogenous
control.
Primer
sequences for mRNA target genes are listed in
Supplementary Table 4, and HPRT1 was used as
the endogenous control. Total RNA was isolated
from cultured cells using miRNeasy mini kit (Qia-
gen), reverse transcription of miRNA was performed
per published protocols32 and cDNA for target genes
were produced using QuantiTect reverse transcrip-
tion kit (Qiagen). qRT-PCR was performed using
SsoAdvanced universal SYBR green supermix (Bio-
Rad). The relative fold change was calculated based
on the difference of Ct values.
In Vitro Invasion Assay
Cell invasion assay was analyzed using a 24 well
system with growth factor reduced Matrigel coated
transwell inserts containing 8 μM pore membrane
(Corning). KNS42 cells (1 × 105) in 250 μl of DMEM/
F12 were added on top of each membrane and fill
bottom with 750 μl of complete growth medium.
After 24 h, migrated cells were dissociated from the
membrane by using Accutase (Sigma-Aldrich) and
resuspended in growth medium. Relative cell num-
bers were measured by using CellTiter-Blue reagent
(Promega).
Wound Healing Assay
Cells were grown in 12-well plates to confluence,
then scratched with 1 P1000 pipette tip. The cells
were rinsed with PBS, imaged, and allowed to
migrate for 48 h before taking a second image. ImageJ
software (National Institutes of Health) was used to
quantify cell migration.

 Soft Agar Clonogenic Assay
One thousand cells were resuspended in growth
medium with 0.4% soft agar, then seeded in 6-well
plate with 0.8% bottom agar layer. After 21 days,
cells were fixed and stained with 0.01% Crystal
violet in 20% methanol. The number of colonies
containing more than 50 cells in each well were
counted using a Nikon inverted microscope.
Statistical Analysis of Cell Culture Assays
All data are presented as mean ± s.d., and Po0.05
was considered significant. All experiments were
performed in at least three biological replicates and
data were analyzed with a two-tailed Student’s t-test.

MicroRNA Profiling Reveals Differentially Expressed
MicroRNAs in Low-Grade Glioma and Glioneuronal
Tumors Compared with Brain
In an unsupervised hierarchical analysis of micro-
RNA expression data, non-neoplastic brain samples
clustered together, whereas subependymal giant cell
astrocytomas
and
rosette-forming
glioneuronal
tumors segregated furthest from non-neoplastic brain
(Figure 1a). A total of 61 microRNAs showed altered
expression among the 10 groups of samples as
evaluated by significance analysis of microarrays.
These microRNAs included a similar list of those that
have been previously identified as having altered
expression in pilocytic astrocytomas as compared
with normal brain. Specifically, miR129-5p, which
was previously validated as downregulated in pilo-
cytic astrocytomas, was also downregulated to a
varying extent in all low-grade gliomas and glioneur-
onal tumors evaluated in this study. Both sub-
ependymal giant cell astrocytomas and pilocytic
astrocytomas had significant decreases in miR129-5p
expression (Po0.05)
(Figure 1b),
leading
us
to
hypothesize that subependymal giant cell astrocyto-
mas may also have increased staining for the nuclear
proteins PBX3 and NFI/B, as previously described
in
pilocytic
astrocytoma.23
Subependymal
giant
cell astrocytomas (n = 3) were stained for PBX3 and
NFI/B according to previously established protocols23
and were scored for nuclear staining on a 0–3 scale as
compared with normal brain. As expected, subepen-
dymal giant cell astrocytomas showed strong (3+)
nuclear staining for PBX3 (2 of 3) and NFIB (3 of 3)
(Figure 1c).

glioneuronal
tumors clustered together and farthest from non-
neoplastic brain, whereas dysembryoplastic neuroe-
pithelial tumor, ganglioglioma, and pleomorphic
xanthoastrocytoma segregated closer to normal brain
(Figure 1a). This raised the possibility that as
dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor, ganglio-
glioma, and pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma have a
mixed cellular composition, the heterogeneous ele-
ments may lead to relative clustering with brain
compared with the homogeneous, well-circumscibed
subependymal giant cell astrocytomas, and pilocytic
astrocytomas. To further identify those microRNAs
that are differentially expressed in homogenous glial
tumors (subependymal giant cell astrocytomas and
pilocytic astrocytomas) and heterogeneous glioneur-
onal tumors (gangliogliomas and dysembryoplastic
neuroepithelial
tumors),
significance
analysis
of
microarrays was performed to directly compare
these two groups. This yielded a list of 35 micro-
RNAs that were differentially expressed between the
two groups, of which all but five were identified as
significant on the initial analysis of all 10 groups
(Figure 2a). In addition, there was a similar direc-
tionality for both glial and glioneuronal tumors vs
brain for the 30 microRNAs that were both signifi-
cant among all 10 groups and between the well-
circumscribed glial and glioneuronal tumors, with
the greatest fold changes seen in subependymal giant
cell astrocytomas (Figure 2b).
Given the enrichment in subependymal giant cell
astrocytomas of significantly altered microRNAs in
the
low-grade
gliomas,
significance
analysis
of
microarrays was performed with unsupervised hier-
archical clustering of differentially regulated micro-
RNAs compared between subependymal giant cell
astrocytomas and brain. This yielded 67 microRNAs
with significantly altered expression, with 42 micro-

and two microRNAs (miR-21-5p and miR-34a-3p)
that were significantly upregulated in subependymal
giant cell astrocytomas and pilocytic astrocytomas
were selected. In addition, miR-1246 and miR-4488,
which showed global overexpression in the low-

expression of these microRNAs in tumors as com-
pared with normal brain is illustrated in Figure 4a.
RT-PCR for these microRNAs was then performed
from paraffin-derived RNA from subependymal giant
cell astrocytoma, pilocytic astrocytoma, dysembryo-
plastic neuroepithelial tumor, ganglioglioma, and
pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma.
Of all the tumors studied, subependymal giant cell
astrocytomas demonstrated the highest degree of
microRNA repression validated by RT-PCR, includ-
ing miR-129-2-3p, miR-219-5p, miR-338-3p, miR-

 microRNAs, miR-21, and miR-34a were overex-
pressed to a greatest extent in subependymal giant
cell astrocytoma, followed by pilocytic astrocytoma
(Figure 4b). Of interest, miR-4488 and miR-1246
were more highly overexpressed in dysembryoplas-
tic neuroepithelial tumor compared with brain and
other tumors (Po0.05), but no repression of miR-219
and miR-338, two microRNAs involved in oligoden-
drocyte differentiation, was identified.
mir-487b Overexpression Affects Stem Cell Markers
and Colony Formation in Soft Agar
Next, we selected miR-487b (under-expressed in
low-grade tumors) and miR-1246 (overexpressed in
low-grade tumors) for additional functional experi-
ments. miR-1246 is activated by p53, and suppresses
the Down syndrome associated protein (DYRK1a).
The Targetscan algorithm predicted miR-487 to
directly target several proteins involved in stem cell
biology including PROM1, Nestin, and WNT5A.
miR-487b and miR-1246 were similarly expressed
in pediatric glioma lines as compared with neural
stem
cells,
although
miR-1246
was
relatively
enriched
in
tumors
versus
stem
cells
(Supplementary
Figures

and

Next,
miR-487b was overexpressed using a lentiviral-
based miRNA plasmid, whereas miR-1246 knock-
down was attempted with a pLV-hsa-mir-1246 locker
in the same pediatric glioma cell lines (data not
shown). Effective miR-1246 knockdown was reliably
achieved in KNS42 cells, which were subjected to
further functional experiments.

miR-487b in the KNS42 cells led to ~ 6 × over-
expression of miR-487b compared with control cells
(Figures 5a and b). miR-487b overexpression led to a
decrease in colony formation in soft agar (30%)
(Po0.05) (Figure 5c) and decreased expression of
the neural stem cell markers, known to be predicted
targets of miR-487b, PROM1, and Nestin (but not
WNT5A) (Figure 5d). miR-487b overexpression had
no significant effect on cell growth, proliferation,
sensitivity to temozolomide, migration, or invasion
(Supplementary Figure 1). Inhibition of miR-1246
with the miR-1246 locker resulted in miR-1246

Discussion
Alterations in microRNA levels have emerged as an
important mechanism in cancer, including glial
tumors.19,20,33,34 MicroRNA regulation also appears
to have an important role in pediatric and low-grade
glial neoplasms. For example, overexpression of
miR-21
and
downregulation
of
miR-124
and
miR-129 is common in pilocytic astrocytoma com-
pared with non-neoplastic brain.22,23 These differ-
ences appear to be accentuated in neurofibromatosis
type
1-associated
pilocytic
astrocytomas
in
particular,23 and were also present in our current
study of a broader spectrum of pathologies.
Very little is known about differential microRNA
expression in other low-grade pediatric and circum-
scribed gliomas and glioneuronal tumors. In a recent
study, a set of microRNAs associated with inflam-
mation
(miR-146a,
miR-21,
and
miR-155)
were
differentially expressed in ganglioglioma and peri-
tumoral
cortex.28
Another
study
demonstrated
increased miR-146a levels in glioneuronal tumors,
possibly as a negative feedback loop to an astrocyte-
mediated inflammatory response.27
In our study, the directionality of altered micro-
RNA expression of these low-grade gliomas was
similar to each other and to microRNAs identified in
previously published high-grade gliomas studies that
were
summarized
in
a
recent
meta-analysis
(Figure 6).35 Many of these alterations are consistent
in directionality with malignancies from other sites,
such as miR-21a-5p, which is upregulated in many
tumor types.23,36 One notable exception was miR-9,
which was downregulated in subependymal giant
cell astrocytomas but slightly upregulated in the
other low-grade tumors, namely in pilocytic astro-
cytomas. This is one of the most commonly cited
upregulated microRNAs in glioblastomas and is
often upregulated in other malignant tumor types.35
One microRNA that was significantly upregulated in
several low-grade gliomas and glioneuronal tumors
was miR-34a, which is frequently downregulated in
other malignant tumors and is thought to act as a
tumor
suppressor.37
In
studies
of
glioblastoma,
miR-34a regulation has been inconsistent, with some
studies showing downregulation as compared with
brain in the proneural subtype,38 but other studies
showing upregulation in glioblastoma as compared
with
anaplastic
astrocytoma.35,39
In
our
study,
miR-34a was consistently upregulated in the glial
and glioneuronal tumors as shown both in micro-
array results and in RT-PCR validation studies.
Further study is necessary to determine the pheno-
type conferred by alterations in microRNAs, such as
miR-9-5p and miR-34a, that have divergent expres-
sion in different glioma types and grades.
Regarding microRNA regulation by specific patho-
logic subtype, it was of interest that subependymal
giant cell astrocytomas and rosette-forming glioneur-
onal tumors clustered together, farthest from non-
neoplastic brain. These tumors share in common a
predominant intraventricular location, and concei-
vably are less likely to have non-neoplastic brain
contamination. However, they also are linked at the
biologic level by having frequent alterations in the
PI3K/mTOR
signaling
pathways.
Subependymal
giant cell astrocytoma is frequently associated with
tuberous sclerosis, characterized at the genetic level

 by germline inactivation of the TSC1 or TSC2 tumor
suppressor genes, whereas rosette-forming glioneur-
onal tumor has frequent mutations in PIK3CA.40
Activation of this pathway through TSC1 deletion
in mouse and human cell lines has been shown to
cause a global inhibition of microRNA biogenesis
through the degradation of Drosha.41 Conversely,
upregulation
of
the
PTEN-inhibitor
microRNA
miR-21 has been shown to occur as a result of
rapamycin inhibition, likely as a mechanism of
negative feedback.42 This microRNA was frequently
upregulated in the low-grade gliomas, including
subependymal giant cell astrocytoma, as evaluated
by both Nanostring hybridization screening and RT-
PCR validation.
In our study, we focused on two microRNAs for
functional validation, miR-487b and miR-1246, as
neither have previously been functionally validated
as participating in gliomagenesis, and both have
significant alterations in expression in low-grade
glial and glioneuronal tumors by both Nanostring
and RT-PCR assays. Although miR487b has been

 identified as downregulated in gliomas, its func-
tional role in glial neoplasms has not been explored.
In the current study, miR-487b overexpression led to
decreased
colony
formation
in
soft
agar
and
decreased levels of the neural stem cell markers
nestin and PROM1 in a pediatric glioma cell line.
The results of these functional experiments were
intriguing, although they were performed on a
pediatric high-grade glioma cell line (KNS42), rather
than in the pediatric low-grade glioma cell lines that
we had available (Res186, Res259). This approach
was necessary for technical reasons, as KNS42 cells
grow as neurospheres, therefore being more appro-
priate for the study of stem cell-like properties. In
addition, KNS42 maintains high levels of miR-487b
stem cell targets in culture (eg, PROM1, Nestin) and
miR-1246 knockdown was successful in this cell line
in our hands. As more appropriate models of
pediatric low-grade glioma become available, similar
experiments may be performed in the future to more
accurately clarify the role of these microRNAs in
pediatric low-grade glioma at the functional level.
miR-487 maps to chromosome locus 14q32.31, a
region that is often deleted in high-risk neuro-
blastoma, and its loss is an indicator of poor
prognosis in a manner that is independent of MYC
expression.43,44 It is part of a parentally imprinted
microRNA
cluster
that
contains
several
other
microRNAs that were frequently under-expressed
in tumors in this study, including miR-485-3p,

tumor types with n43 in our data set (subependymal giant cell astrocytoma, pilocytoic astrocytoma, pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma,
ganglioglioma, and dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor)) shows similar directionality in expression to previous studies of
glioblastoma (GBM) summarized in a recent meta-analysis.35

 miR-410,

miR-495,
and
miR-543.
Tested miR-487b targets in this context include
components of neurodevelopmental and oncogenic
signaling pathways WNT5a, BMI1, MYC, KRAS, and
SUZ12.45 Interestingly, miR-487b may also be regu-
lated by DNA methylation in tumorigenesis, as a
response to cigarette smoke, a proposed mechanism
for its involvement in lung tumors.45,46 The 14q32.31
cluster also appears to be differentially regulated in
an epigenetic manner at different stages of stem cell
reprogramming.47 miR-487b specifically appears to
be relevant to CNS pathology, being upregulated in
the blood of patients with ischemic stroke, and also
promotes angiogenesis.48,49 Notably, it is down-
regulated in glioblastomas along with other micro-
RNAs within the 14q32.31 cluster compared with
non-neoplastic brain in some studies.50,51 As the
targets of these genes are enriched in glial-specifi-
city, this cluster may have an important role in glial
tumor biology.50
In contrast to miR-487b, miR-1246 was consis-
tently overexpressed in low-grade glioma and glio-
neuronal tumors in our study by microarray and RT-
PCR. miR-1246 maps to chromosome region 2q31.1.
It is a target of the tumor suppressor p53,52–54 but has
been found to be upregulated in various cancers. For
instance, miR-1246 is upregulated in neuroblastoma
cells,55 and serum exosomes of pancreatic and
esophageal cancer patients;56,57 it promotes sphere
formation
and
chemoresistance
in
pancreatic
cancer,58 stemness and invasion in lung cancer,59
and enhances migration and invasion in hepatocel-
lular carcinoma cell lines.60 This microRNA is also
abundant in the exosomes of neural stem cells.61 One
notable technical difficulty in studying miR-1246,
however, is the inclusion of this sequence in the
transcript for the small noncoding nuclear RNA
RNAU2-1f, which has also been identified as a
circulating RNA upregulated in tumorigenesis, that
can be alternately spliced to produce miR-1246, and
possibly miR-1290.62,63 Future sequencing studies
may be necessary to determine the extent to which
the RNA hybridization assays for miR-1246 are also,
or exclusively, recognizing RNAU2-1f. If this is true
in this case, RNAU2-1f may be a useful circulating
biomarker
for
glioma
growth.
In
addition,
if
miR-1246
does
not
function
independently
of
RNAU2-1f in glial tumorigenesis, this may explain
its
lack
of
a
tumorigenic
role
in
cell
culture
experiments.
In summary, differential microRNA expression is a
feature of a variety of low-grade, primarily pediatric,
glioma, and glioneuronal tumor types. miR-487b
appears to inhibit the expression of stem cell
markers and properties in vitro, a finding that should
be validated in the future in larger studies. These
studies have a potential to increase our basic under-
standing of the genetic and epigenetics mechanisms
responsible
for
gliomagenesis,
and
lead
to
the
development of rational biomarkers and therapeutic
targets.
