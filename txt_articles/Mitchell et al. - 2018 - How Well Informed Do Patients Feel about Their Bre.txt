How Well Informed Do Patients Feel about Their
Breast Cancer Surgery Options? Findings from a
Nationwide Survey of Women after Lumpectomy
and/or Mastectomy
Sunny Mitchell, MD, Jennifer Gass, MD, FACS, Michael Hanna, PhD
BACKGROUND:
Women diagnosed with breast cancer often describe the process of treatment decision making as
bewildering and worrisome. Patients who do not feel completely informed about their surgical
options might make choices that are suboptimal or regretted later. The Institute of Medicine has
called for more research on why breast cancer patients are inadequately informed about treat-
ment options. The aims of the study were to explore how women become informed about their
breast cancer surgery treatment options and to identify improvement opportunities.
STUDY DESIGN: A nationwide internet survey was conducted among women who reported being surgically
treated by lumpectomy only (n ¼ 215), mastectomy only (n ¼ 140), or by both procedures
(n ¼ 132) for breast cancer. To improve generalizability, Census-based enrollment quotas
were applied for geographic region, health insurance, and income.
RESULTS:
Only 47% (95% CI 41% to 54%) of lumpectomy-only patients, 67% (95% CI 59% to
75%) of mastectomy-only patients, and 28% (95% CI 21% to 35%) of patients having both
procedures said they felt “completely informed” about treatment options before their oper-
ations. “Making a quick decision” was more important than “thoroughly researching all
options” for 35% of lumpectomy-only patients, 31% of mastectomy-only patients, and 22%
of patients having both procedures. Nearly all women used some other source of information
to research treatment options. Lumpectomy-only and mastectomy-only patients who relied
on their surgeon’s recommendation without additional research were significantly less likely
to report feeling “completely informed” (odds ratio 0.6; 95% CI 0.4 to 0.9; p < 0.02).
CONCLUSIONS:
Many women who had surgery for breast cancer did not feel completely informed about their
surgical options. This appears to be due, in part, to a false sense of urgency and perhaps insuf-
ficient or misdirected information gathering by patients. The responsibility for fully informing
patients about their treatment options must be better fulfilled by surgeons. (J Am Coll Surg

Breast cancer is, after skin cancer, the most common type
of cancer, with 230,815 newly diagnosed cases in women
in the US in 2013.1,2 Most newly diagnosed cases of breast
cancer are early-stage tumors amenable to treatment with
good long-term survival outcomes.3-5 Surgical removal of
the tumor currently plays a crucial role in the treatment of
breast cancer.6-9 Yet the scaring and deformity associated
with surgical treatment often have long-term negative im-
pacts on the survivors’ body image, sexual function, social
adjustment, and mental health.10-14 Given that overall 5-
year survival rates are very highd98.9% for stage I breast
cancer and 85.2% for stage II,15 the treatment team is

 addresses the long-term consequences of cancer therapy
on the physical and mental health of the patients.16,17
The initial phase of caredfrom the moment of diagnosis
to the point of making a shared treatment decisiondis
generally a worrisome and overwhelming time for
patients.18-20 But that initial phase is also a key moment
of opportunity for the healthcare team to provide patients
with medically reliable information about all of the surgi-
cal treatment options and the comprehensive care avail-
able to ensure the patient’s long-term well-being after
the operation.
The Institute of Medicine has issued a special report,
Ensuring Quality Cancer Care.21 They described an ideal
cancer care system in which patients will have an “aware-
ness of all treatment options and the risks and benefits
associated with each.”21 For breast cancer treatment
specifically, the Institute of Medicine also described
several quality problems, including “inadequate patient
counseling regarding treatment options.”21 They then
emphasized, “The reasons for failure to deliver high-
quality care have not been studied adequately.”21 There-
fore, 1 of their 10 recommendations was: “Studies are
needed to find out why specific segments of the popula-
tion.do not receive appropriate cancer care. These
studies should measure provider and [patient] knowl-
edge, attitudes, and beliefs, as well as other potential
barriers to access to care.”21
The aim of the nationwide survey research reported
here was to explore how women become informed about
their breast cancer surgery treatment options and to
explore some of the possible reasons why they might
feel less than completely informed about their options.
Women who feel, and in fact are, completely informed
about their breast cancer surgery options will make
higher-quality shared treatment decisions and experience

outcomes.18,20,22,23 It is our hope that a better understand-
ing of which women feel insufficiently informed about
surgery treatment options and why will lead to practical
improvements in pretreatment patient education.
METHODS
Study design
The study was designed as a post-treatment survey to
obtain quantitative results from the patient perspective
and would be generalizable to the larger population.
The survey was administered nationwide through the
internet in the US from June 13 to 24, 2016, by Wake-
field Research, an independent public opinion research
firm, administering quantitative and qualitative survey
research in 66 different countries.
Participant recruiting and consent
A pool of potential patient survey participants had been
recruitedpreviouslyfromvarioussources(suchashealthadvo-
cacy groups, clinics, and other health-related organizations),
and they had agreed to be contacted about participation in
a variety of public surveys. Very brief email invitations were
sent to a subset of the pool of potential participants. Based
on information they had provided previously, it was expected
that all recipients of that email would be adult women with a
past or current diagnosis of cancer (of some kind) (yet those
points were double-checked in the survey’s screening ques-
tions). The email told them that there was a survey available
for which they might be eligible and provided them with a
link to the online survey if they wanted to participate. No
other reminders were sent. If they clicked that link, it led to
a brief survey welcome page explaining that their answers
would be collected anonymously for research and they would
receive a small monetary incentive if they completed the sur-
vey. That page then also gave them the option to click a
“Next” button if they chose to participate in the survey.
Participant eligibility
Respondents were eligible to participate if they provided
the following answers on the screening questions: female
sex, age 18 to 99 years, had ever been diagnosed with
breast cancer, and had undergone lumpectomy or mastec-
tomy (or both). If women reported both lumpectomy and
mastectomy, they were assigned to the mastectomy survey
until that study group reached its enrollment limit and
was closed to additional recruiting; thereafter, such
women were assigned to the lumpectomy survey.
Questionnaire
The questionnaire had 3 sections. The first section contained
7 screening and demographic characteristic questions. Re-
spondents were then instructed to think of their most recent
lumpectomyormastectomy,dependingontheirsurveygroup
assignment.Withregardtotheportionsofthesurveyreported
here, the survey was otherwise the same for all respondents.
The second section of the survey contained 16 possible con-
tent questions on the topics of this survey, but respondents
were asked only 13 or 14 of these questions, depending on
their answers. This article reports only content questions 1
to 7, which were asked in the same form for all respondents,
regardless of their answers or study group. (The results of
questions 8 to 16 will be reported in a subsequent article.)
The third section contained 9 demographic characteristic
questions. The demographic characteristic questions were
all quite standard and have been widely used in research for
years. The content questions and medical screening questions
were written specifically for this survey; they were neither

 Figure 1. The flow of respondents through recruiting, screening, and completion of the survey. As
seen toward the bottom of the figure, 10 respondents from the mastectomy survey and 3 participants
from the lumpectomy survey were later purged from the database. They had checked all or nearly all
answer options to the screening questions about medical conditions, types of cancer, and breast
cancer treatments. Presumably these were “professional” survey respondents who knew that if they
did not check the right answer on those screening questions, then they would be terminated and not
receive the monetary incentive. Indeed, 5 of those 13 were all from New York so might have been the
same person using multiple emails, and another 5 of 13 were from New Jersey so might have also
been just one person.

 previously validated nor piloted. The questionnaire is pre-
sented as eDocument 1.
Demographic quotas and sample size
Enrollment quotas were set for the 4 geographic areas of the
US (Northeast, South, Midwest, West), health insurance sta-
tus, and income level, using information from the US Census
Bureau, so that the total study sample (n ¼ 500) would reflect
the demographics of the general US population on those pa-
rameters. When quotas were reached for subgroups on those
parameters, additional respondents who were “over quota”
were terminated from the survey, and their data were not
used. A target sample size of 500 was chosen because the
firm administering the survey had estimated that the 95%
CI of the results expressed in percentages would be �4.4%
at that sample size. To ensure balance, a limit of 250 was later
set for each study group (lumpectomy and mastectomy), and
when the target sample size for a study group was reached, the
survey was closed for that study group.
Statistical analysis
Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the study
sample and summarize their responses to the content
questions. To assess the precision of our survey results,
95% CIs were calculated for the descriptive results of
some key outcomes, using bootstrapping with 1,000 iter-
ations of the sample.24,25 Multivariable logistic regression
analysis was performed to determine whether the response
to the main end point (question 6: respondent felt
“completely informed”) depended on various other pre-
dictor variables. The number of predictor variables tested
in the model depended on the descriptive results to the
outcomes variable, according to the generally accepted
guideline of 10 events per variable.26-31 Also as per best
practices, the predictor variables were selected for testing
in the regression model based on our expectations of their
relevancy, not on earlier statistical testing.
Reporting
The study has been reported according to recommended
best practices and proto-guidelines in the literature for
the reporting of survey research.32-35 A forthcoming article
will report the remaining results related to the postopera-
tive impact of surgery.
RESULTS
Study enrollment
The flow of respondents is reported in Figure 1. Because
internet surveys are not comparable with traditional mail
surveys,34,35 somewhat different calculations and standards
must be applied, as follows. The response rate to the email
invitation (ie the view rate of the survey “welcome” page)
while the survey was still open to enrollment was 57.8%
(3,004 of 5,200). The consent/participation rate was
92.3% (2,774 of 3,004). The eligibility rate (aside from
later demographic quotas on income and insurance) was
20.6% (571 of 2,774). The rate of proper completion
with the later quota restraints was 85.3% (487 of 571).
Among the 487 respondents in the final database, there
were no missing data.
No attempt was made to compare the responders and
nonresponders, or the consenters and nonconsenters,
because most of the nonresponders and nonconsenters
would not have met the eligibility criteria anyway. No
attempt was made to compare the completers and non-
completers, because most of the noncompleters were
terminated simply because they were over quota on a de-
mographic variable and should not have differed from the
completers.
There were 143 participants who reported both lump-
ectomy and mastectomy (Fig. 1, middle); most of them
were assigned to the mastectomy survey (ie instructed to
answer the questions for their most recent mastectomy);
and 132 of them remained in the final database (Fig. 1,
bottom). These patients can represent any possible clinical
history that would lead a woman to have both procedures
during any time period. Indeed, they probably have
various histories. It was not originally our intention to
present their results separately, but we eventually realized
that we had to because their results were quite different
(both for demographic characteristics and for survey re-
sponses) and because the variety of possible medical his-
tories within group that had both procedures renders it
difficult to interpret their results.
For reading convenience, we present the results of the
three 3 groups side by side, but due to the study design,
the groups cannot be meaningfully compared with each
other, and that is not the aim of the survey anyway.
The aim is to compare each group, independently, with
our expectations of what the responses would be from
women receiving best-quality cancer care.
Study sample characteristics
The demographic and healthcare characteristics of the
study sample are presented in Table 1.
Survey responses: sense of time pressure
The survey attempted, in 2 different ways, to assess
women’s sense of time pressure when making a decision
about surgical options. First, the survey asked them
whether researching all of their options or making a quick
decision was their priority. Approximately one-third of
the lumpectomy-only and the mastectomy-only patients,

 as well as one-fifth of the patients that had both proced-
ures, responded that making a quick decision was more
important (Fig. 2A).
Next, the survey asked them how strongly they agreed or
disagreed that they wished they would have had more time
to explore different breast cancer surgery options. The ma-
jority of all 3 groups agreed somewhat or strongly that they
wished they would have had more time (Fig. 2B).
For each of the 3 groups of patients, there was no cor-
relation between their answers to those 2 questions in
Figure 2 (details of Spearman’s correlation not shown),
and there was no significant difference in the answer to
question 4 (wished had more time), when comparing
(within each treatment group) the patients who priori-
tized making a quick decision vs those who prioritized
thoroughly researching all options) (details of results not
shown). In simple terms, the sense of wishing that one
would have had more time to explore breast cancer sur-
gery options (question 4, Fig. 2B) bears no relationship
to the choice of prioritizing a fast decision or thorough
research (question 2, Fig. 2A); these are 2 entirely
different and unrelated types of time pressure, originating
internally (question 2) vs externally (question 4).
Survey responses: sources of information
The median (10th to 90th percentile) time duration reported
for the breast cancer surgery consultation (question 1) was
40 (15 to 60) minutes for lumpectomy-only patients, 45
(12 to 120) minutes for mastectomy-only patients, and
17.5 (5 to 60) minutes for both-procedures patients.
When presented with the statement, “once my breast
cancer surgeon recommended a surgery, I did not feel
the need to research other options” (question 3), the num-
ber of patients who agreed somewhat or strongly was: 142
(66%) lumpectomy-only patients, 89 (64%) mastectomy-
only patients, and 100 (76%) both-procedures patients.
Getting a second surgical opinion before deciding on a
breast cancer surgical treatment (question 5) was reported
by 129 (60%) lumpectomy-only patients, 63 (45%)
mastectomy-only
patients,
and
115
(87%)
both-
procedures patients.
The survey respondents were presented with a list of
types of sources to research information about breast can-
cer surgery treatment options and asked to select all they
used (question 7). In all 3 groups, the vast majority of
patients used at least one source of medical information
and at least one source of social support (Table 2).

 Survey responses: feeling of how well informed
The survey participants were asked how informed or
uninformed they felt about treatment options before
undergoing breast cancer surgery (question 6). Among
lumpectomy-only patients, 101 (47%; 95% CI 41% to
54%) said they felt “completely informed,” 104 (48%;

(4.7%; 95% CI 1% to 9%) felt “somewhat uninformed”

tients, 94 (67%; 95% CI 59% to 75%) said they felt
“completely informed,” 39 (28%; 95% CI 21% to 36%)
felt “somewhat informed,” and 7 (5%; 95% CI 1% to

92 (70%; 95% CI 61% to 77%) said they felt “somewhat
informed,” and 3 (2.3%; 95% CI 0% to 5%) said they
felt “somewhat uninformed” or “completely uninformed.”
Regression analysisassessed someof the factors thatmight
influence whether or not the survey respondents had
answered that they felt “completely informed” (Table 3).
DISCUSSION
Surgeons and other healthcare professionals are expected to
provide patients with not only biomedical treatments, but
also with sufficient health education for the patients to
understand their conditions and make informed treatment
choices. This reflects the paradigm shift, particularly in
cancer care, to a shared decision-making model.20,38-42
Receiving a diagnosis of cancer puts most patients into a
state of crisis, combined with apprehension and bewilder-
ment, because they perceive cancer as life-threatening and
lack
sufficient
knowledge
about treatment
options.
Although most cancer patients will make independent ef-
forts to better inform themselves, it is unrealistic to expect
that the majority of patients have sufficient health literacy,
research skills, information access, and clarity of mind to
inform themselves about all treatment options well enough
to make the best healthcare decisions for themselves. So
when a patient receives a diagnosis of breast cancer, the re-
sponsibility for educating the patient about her condition
and treatment options, and then verifying that she is suffi-
ciently informed to make such a decision, must be fulfilled
by the healthcare providers.
Our nationwide survey shows that more than half of
the lumpectomy-only women, about one-third of the
mastectomy-only women, and more than two-thirds of

*The survey did not offer an option for other kinds of licensed healthcare practitioners, such as nurses, psychologists, and social workers. If it had, surely some
portion of respondents would have checked it.
yBecause this was an online survey, it must be assumed that, on average, the respondents have somewhat higher rates of internet access and use than the general
population as a whole. Accordingly, the use rates here for online sources of information about breast cancer surgery treatment options are probably somewhat
higher than would be found in the general population. Consequently, the use rates for their offline equivalents (books and magazines and in-person support
groups) might also be a bit lower here than in the general population.
zAlthough the survey offered an “other” option, it was rarely used, and it can be assumed that most respondents did not give it much thought. If they had,
probably at least some of them would have thought of additional sources they used. In particular, past research has reported very high rates of using health
pamphlets or brochures, and substantial rates of using mass media, such as newspapers, television, radio, and movies.19 The few write-in answers that were
given were all deemed to be sources of reliable medical information.
xThe survey did not offer the option of “decision-making aids.” If it had, surely some portion of respondents would have checked it.
jjThe survey did not offer options for either unregulated forms of “alternative medicine” practitioners or healers, or for religious sources (either people, written
materials, place of worship). If the survey had, surely some portion of respondents would have checked such options.19
{The response option of “significant other” was only shown to respondents who had previously indicated that they were “married or living as married” or “in a
relationship” (Table 1). For the sake of comparisons, the percent in the Table for this line is still based on the entire samples for that treatment group. Among
the subset of subjects who had a significant other, 36% of lumpectomy subjects, 47% of mastectomy subjects, and 38% of subjects who had both procedures
reported using their significant other as a source to resource information about breast cancer surgery treatment options.

 the both-procedures women did not report feeling
“completely informed” about their treatment options
before undergoing the procedures. Previous studies have
shown that most breast cancer patients feel more
informed than they actually are.19,23,43 So, consistent
with past research18,19,23,43-45 and the Institute of Medicine
special report,21 there appears to be a substantial defi-
ciency in the informing of women about their breast can-
cer treatment options. Some patients (and therefore some
doctors too) might feel that being “somewhat informed”
is sufficient and satisfactory. But if a patient is only
“somewhat informed,” then she might not be aware of
some treatment options that she would prefer if she
knew about them, and postoperatively she might discover,
with regret, that there were some aspects of treatment
about which she wishes she had been better informed.
So from our viewpoint, even if some patients feel satisfied
with being only “somewhat informed,” we as healthcare
professionals still have an ethical responsibility to ensure
that our patients are completely informed.
We also found that the vast majority of women were
turning to other sources for information about treatment
options (Table 2), consistent with past research.19,44,45
Another large survey, conducted a decade ago with
women in Los Angeles, CA and Detroit, MI, who had
mostly undergone breast-conserving operations, also
asked about what sources of information the women
used.19 Despite somewhat lower education levels, that sur-
vey’s sample reported higher use rates of books (60%), sci-
entific journal papers (52%), and magazines (51%)
compared with our survey’s lumpectomy-only patients’
use of books or magazines (28%), and slightly lower rates
of internet use (48% vs 58%), probably all due to the shift
from print to digital during the past decade, and perhaps
also due to culturally declining interest in reading. They
also reported higher use rates of friends (65% vs 41%),
relatives (59% vs 45%), and spouse or partner (35% vs
27%), perhaps due to that sample’s higher mean age, or
easier in-person contact in their denser urban setting, or
perhaps due to decreasing social human conversations
during the past decade. The use of other sources of infor-
mation can be viewed as positive, because it shows that
many women are making efforts to inform themselves
about their medical condition and treatment options,
and to get social support from other people outside the
medical setting, although perhaps less so than in the
past. On the other hand, the use of other sources of infor-
mation might also suggest that healthcare providers are
not adequately fulfilling the information needs of many
patients, instead they are leaving patients to seek

 information elsewhere themselves.44 Whatever the reasons
might be, the use of those other sources of information
might not always be beneficial because some of those
sources might be providing misinformation or otherwise
be confusing and counterproductive (Table 3).19,45,46 In
addition, most patients lack sufficient research skills to
locate all of the best information available and lack suffi-
cient medical knowledge to evaluate the quality of the in-
formation they find. Therefore, healthcare providers
should be prepared to provide vetted, medically reliable
information in a variety of formats. In addition, system-
atic literature reviews have concluded that up-to-date de-
cision aids increase patient knowledge and reduce
decisional conflict.47-50 Given their benefits, greater avail-
ability and use of decision aids appears warranted. Yet
they must also be kept up-to-date.
One specific problem in the informing process is that
many patients feel pressure to make treatment decisions
hastily because they themselves prioritize making a quick
decision (Fig. 2A) or because they passively get swept along
into making a decision sooner than they wished they had
(Fig. 2B)deither of which might result in patients being
less informed than they would have been otherwise. Previ-
ous studies have also reported on this problem of a sense of
urgency or time pressure.18,19 Only about 60% of breast
cancer patients know that waiting 4 weeks to make a treat-
ment decision has little or no effect on survival.23,51,52 From
the moment of diagnosing breast cancer onward, the
healthcare team should reassure patients that a diagnosis
of breast cancer is not a medical emergency. Instead, pa-
tients can and should take the time to become completely
informed about their treatment options, evaluate these op-
tions with their social support circles, and make a fully
informed shared decision with their doctors.19
Cancer patients need time to learn about cancer and treat-
ment options, but unlimited time is not often available for
the surgical consultation. The median surgical consultation
time in all 3 survey groups was less than 1 hour, and only
12% of the entire sample reported a consultation time
longer than 60 minutes. Because societal resources are not
infinite, surgeons’ time must be used wisely and efficiently.
Patients need to be informed through multiple other modes,
including vetted information websites, validated up-to-date
decision aids, referrals to high-quality patient support and
advocacy groups, and consultations with other licensed
healthcare providers (eg specialized nurses, patient naviga-
tors, advanced practice providers, physician extenders, and
counselors).44 Nonetheless, the healthcare system should
ensure that patients who have already used these other infor-
mation resources will also have sufficient consultation time
with their surgeon to ensure that they are “completely
informed” before signing the informed consent forms.
Our research has several limitations that must be kept
in mind. 1) This survey was cross-sectional, not longitu-
dinal (ie data were collected at a single time point, not
several), so the survey participants’ responses about preop-
erative aspects might have been influenced by their subse-
quent post-surgical experiences. 2) This survey was
conducted during one brief period (June 2016) with no
relation to the date of surgery. Consequently, many re-
spondents might have already been several years post-
operation, and their experiences might have differed
from those of more recent patients. 3) Some participants’
responses to certain questions might have suffered from
recall bias. 4) Due to the design and sampling, the results
might not be applicable to many breast cancer patients,
including women living outside the US; women who do
not read English53; men2,54; and women who do not use
the internet due to lack of access, lack of interest, or other
reasons. 5) Women whose health has deteriorated sub-
stantially since their operation (eg due to cancer recur-
rence,
surgical
complications,
or
other
unrelated
comorbidities) would be less likely to participate in public
surveys than women in reasonably good health. This
might have led to sample selection bias against such
women. 6) The validity and reliability of our question-
naire have not been assessed. 7) The medical information
about these survey participants relied on self-report and
was not verified clinically or in their medical records.
8) Because we did not have access to their medical records
and because it can be complicated to reliably gather such
information through an anonymous survey, our report
does not present much clinical detail about the study sam-
ple, although it does provide very thorough demographic
characterization. 9) Consequently, the both-procedures
group remains somewhat opaque, because the reasons
why they had both operations remains undetermined.
Despite these limitations, we believe that the overall pic-
ture provided by this survey does still reliably reflects real
deficiencies in the informing of breast cancer patients and
does provide insights for improvements.
In addition, this research has some strengths. 1) As a sur-
vey, this research provides the valuable but often missing
patient perspective. 2) This survey was nationwide and
representative of the US population in terms of broad
geographic areas, income, and insurance status, and seem-
ingly several other demographic variables. 3) The survey
was administered by a well-established public surveying
firm, and the questionnaire was carefully worded to avoid
otherwise common errors in the phrasing of survey ques-
tions and response choices.55 4) The rates of participation
and survey completion were sufficiently high to believe that
this study sample was representative of women in the US
with regular internet use. 5) There were no missing data
10

 or “don’t know” responses. 6) The bootstrapped 95% CIs
were sufficiently narrow that the conclusions drawn would
not change meaningfully anywhere within that range,
which gives us confidence that the results reliably reflect
the answers that would be found in the larger population
from which this sample was drawn.
This nationwide survey provides many new insights that
open up important questions for additional research. For
example, there are numerous possible ways to inform pa-
tients about their surgical treatment options before
decision
making
with
the
surgeon
(eg
brochures,
decision-making aids, information videos, conversations
with nurses or physician assistants, websites, and patient
support groups), and patients often use multiple chan-
nels.19,44 It would therefore be helpful to comparatively
assess how effective these various channels are for inform-
ing patients so that the best channels will be promoted and
the worst ones discontinued. Another possible area for
research would be more in-depth analysis of surgeon-to-
patient communication and relationships because it is
quite challenging to discuss complex medical information
with patients facing a life-changing illness. Many survey re-
spondents did not report feeling completely informed, and
this appeared related to just accepting the surgeon’s recom-
mendation without researching other options and also to
getting a second opinion, among other factors (Table 3).
It would be important to understand to what degree this
feeling of not being completely informed might or might
not be due to easily remediable aspects of communication
during the final conversation with the patient just before
signing the informed consent forms. Close reading of the
details of our nationwide survey results and the broad
themes we raise here should point to many other fruitful
avenues for future research on how the preoperative
informing process could be improved.
Additional research is also needed on women who have
both lumpectomy and mastectomy. Our survey did not
differentiate between the various possible medical his-
tories behind this study group (including the amount of
time between the procedures, whether due to recurrence,
whether contralateral, or whether prophylactic) Regard-
less of the possible history, their results were often surpris-
ing or puzzling to us. Several unexpected demographic
differences stood out (Table 1). Despite having both
procedures and reporting comparable or higher rates of
use of all information sources (Table 2) and higher rates
of second surgical opinions, they still reported feeling
“completely informed” much less often than the women
who had lumpectomy only or mastectomy only. We do
not have any compelling explanations for this paradoxical
finding; additional research is obviously needed on this
patient population.
CONCLUSIONS
This survey found that a large portion of American
women who had operations for breast cancer did not
feel completely informed about their treatment options.
All healthcare providers should strive to create the ideal
cancer care system in which patients have an “awareness
of all treatment options and the risks and benefits associ-
ated with each.”21 Such efforts could include proactively
planning how to better inform patients about their treat-
ment options, reassuring patients that they have sufficient
time to become informed, providing a variety of other
sources of vetted information, decision aids, and referrals
to comprehensive care providers, and scheduling follow-
up consultations until the patient is completely informed.
Patients who are completely informed of all their treat-
ment options will make higher-quality shared decisions
about treatment and will experience better long-term
survivorship outcomes.18,23,56
