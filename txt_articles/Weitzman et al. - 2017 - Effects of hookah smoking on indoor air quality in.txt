Abstract
Introduction—Hookahs (water pipes) are rapidly increasing in popularity worldwide. Evidence 
suggests that although perceived as safer than cigarette smoke, hookah smoke may be as, or even 
more, dangerous as cigarette smoke.
Methods—Air samples from 33 homes—11 where only hookah-smoking occurred, 12 with only 
cigarettes and 10 with no smoking—were collected to analyse concentrations of particulate matter 
(PM2.5), black carbon, elemental and organic carbon and carbon monoxide (CO). Air quality was 
assessed in rooms where smoking occurred and in an adjacent room.
Results—Hookah and cigarette smoking impaired home air quality. The rooms in which hookahs 
were smoked showed the highest concentrations for all pollutants. CO was significantly greater in

 the rooms where hookahs were smoked than in the cigarette-smoking rooms and the non-smoking 
households (p<0.05). In addition, CO levels in the rooms adjacent to where hookah was smoked 
were 2.5-fold to 4-fold greater than those in the smoking and non-smoking rooms of the cigarette 
homes (p<0.05). PM2.5 levels were also elevated in hookah homes compared to cigarette and non-
smoking homes, although not significantly different.
Conclusions—This study, the first of its kind, demonstrates potentially hazardous levels of 
home air pollution in rooms where hookahs are being smoked as well as in adjacent rooms. These 
levels were greater than those in cigarette smoking homes, raising concerns about potential 
negative health effects on all individuals living in homes where hookahs are smoked.
INTRODUCTION
Although cigarette use has dramatically declined globally, there has been a recent, rapid 
upturn in the use of other forms of tobacco.1 From 2000 to 2011, cigarette consumption in 
the USA has declined 33%, but the drop in cigarette use is being offset by the marked 
increase in the consumption of alternative tobacco products, including cigars, cigarillos, 
smokeless tobacco and hookah.23 A recent review suggests that hookah (also called water 
pipe, hubble-bubble or narghile) use may be the ‘second global tobacco epidemic since the 
cigarette’.4 The National Youth Tobacco Survey reported that in 2011, 8% of male and 5% 
of female middle school and high school students in the USA ever used hookah, but by 
2014, these rates had more than doubled to 14% for boys and almost tripled to 15% for 
girls.5 In 2015, 25% of male and 22% of female college students in the USA reported ever 
used hookah.6 Among young adults, almost one in four have used hookah.7
Secondhand smoke (SHS) from cigarettes includes more than 7000 toxic chemicals that kill 
more than 600 000 non-smokers globally each year.8 In addition to the adult mortality and 
morbidity that is widely recognised, it is well known that SHS is responsible for causing an 
increased risk of ear infections, respiratory infections, asthma attacks and sudden infant 
death syndrome, as well as a myriad of other health problems among children, such as 
increased risks of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and the metabolic syndrome.9 
WHO estimates that 700 million or half of the world’s children may be exposed to SHS, 
especially in homes.10 The 2011–2012 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 
found that 41% of children aged 3–11 years were exposed to SHS.2 Among non-smoking 
adults, more than 20% reported SHS exposure in their workplace.11 To date, SHS has largely 
been investigated and thought to arise mainly from cigarette smoke, and there is very limited 
research on hookah smoking as a source of SHS, even though hookah smoking has already 
been associated with an increased risk of lung cancer,12 periodontal disease,13 respiratory 
disease,14 and low birthweight in infants15 and the sharing of hookahs can spread infectious 
diseases, such as hepatitis C, tuberculosis and herpes.1617
Hookah use is widely perceived to be a safer alternative to cigarettes because the smoke is 
filtered through water,1819 but growing evidence indicates that actively smoking hookahs 
may be as or more harmful than smoking cigarettes.20–22 Moreover, a number of studies 
have found that SHS from hookah use contains high concentrations of particulate matter 
(PM2.5).2324 Studies measuring the indoor air quality of hookah bars have shown PM2.5 and

 carbon monoxide (CO) concentrations ranging from ‘unhealthy’ to ‘hazardous’ according to 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standards for outdoor air pollution, but these 
studies have focused on commercial hookah bars, despite widespread home use of these 
devices.25–30 It is likely that many hookah smokers smoke at home, and that this is the most 
likely place where children and other non-hookah smokers are exposed to hookah-related 
SHS. To date, however, there is only one study that we are aware of that has assessed air 
quality in the homes of hookah smokers,31 demonstrating nicotine in the air and on surfaces, 
as well as biological evidence of children’s exposure. No other measures of air quality in 
homes of hookah smokers have been assessed.
We report the results of a study that assessed indoor air quality in homes where hookahs 
were smoked and compared the air quality in these homes to that in homes where cigarettes 
but not hookahs were smoked, and in homes where no smoking (hookah or cigarettes) 
occurred. To assess the air quality in homes where hookah or cigarettes were smoked, 
multiple measures of air pollution were examined in this study. The primary measurements 
were airborne particles <2.5 μm in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5) and CO. Both pollutants 
are associated with adverse health effects and are of major concern in the SHS produced by 
hookahs.212330
METHODS
Participants
A convenience sample of 33 homes, in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), was 
recruited to participate in the study of the air quality in their homes; 11 homes where only 
hookah was smoked, 12 homes where only cigarettes were smoked and 10 homes where 
neither hookahs nor cigarettes were smoked. Research field staff were trained by two of the 
investigators (TG and MW) in collection of air samples to assess: PM2.5, black carbon (BC), 
organic and elemental carbon (OC/EC) and CO. Air quality was measured in the room 
where smoking occurred and in one adjacent non-smoking room in homes where hookahs or 
cigarettes were smoked. In non-smoking homes, air sampling was conducted in the bedroom 
and living room and the values were averaged.
Inclusion criteria was restricted to the customary use of hookahs or cigarettes at home or the 
use of no tobacco product in the home, and the use of a single smoking product at a time 
during the sampling period (ie, hookah or cigarettes). The length of smoking time, the 
number of smokers, the number of children in households, number of hookahs or cigarettes 
smoked, ventilation during smoking sessions, sampling time, as well as the size of the room 
where smoking occurred during air quality assessment are shown in table 1. Informed 
consent was received from one adult in each participating household after the study was 
approved by the New York University School of Medicine and by the Dubai Health 
Authority’s Institutional Review Boards.
Sample collection
In each home, research staff operated pre-calibrated monitoring equipment with personal 
environmental monitors (PEM) (SKC; Eighty Four, Pennsylvania, USA) to collect total

 PM2.5 gravimetric samples on polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) filters (Pall Corp, Port 
Washington, New York, USA) at 10 L/min using Legacy pumps (SKC). Airborne OC/EC 
levels were collected on pre-baked (650°C overnight) quartz (Pall) filters and PEMs that 
operated at a sample flow rate of 10 L/min. After collection, quartz filters were sealed and 
transferred to a −20°C freezer. A dry gas meter (BIOS Dry Cal DC-Lite, Brandt Instruments, 
Prairieville, Louisiana, USA) was used before each run to calibrate sample flow rates. 
Continuously logging microaethalometers (Model AE51 with a PM2.5 inlet, AethLabs, San 
Francisco, California, USA), CO data loggers (0–300 ppm, EL-USB-CO, Lascar, Erie, 
Pennsylvania, USA), and pressure-compensated and humidity-compensated aerosol 
monitors (pDR-1500 with a PM2.5 inlet, resolution of 1 μg/m3, Thermo Fisher Scientific, 
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA) were used to monitor real time BC (1 min intervals), CO, 
and PM2.5 (1 min intervals), respectively.
During a 60–75 min hookah smoking session within each study home where hookah was 
smoked, the research team collected air samples in the room where hookah was smoked and 
simultaneously in an adjacent room within the house. In cigarette-only homes, cigarettes 
were smoked for 60–85 min with a range of 1–14 cigarettes smoked by 1–4 people in each 
home. Similar sampling times were conducted in homes where no smoking occurred.
Chemical analysis
Gravimetric analysis of PTFE filters were performed in an environmentally controlled 
weighing facility (22°±1°C and 40% ±1% relative humidity) using established operating 
procedures. Filters were equilibrated to ambient conditions in the weighing facility for a 
minimum of 24 hours before measurement, degaussed and weighed repeatedly until the 
mass values agreed within 5 μg. The mass concentrations of EC and OC were measured 
from the quartz filters using the Lab OCEC Aerosol Analyzer following the NIOSH (2003) 
method 5040 (Sunset Instruments, Hillsborough, North Carolina, USA).
Statistical analysis
The collected data were categorised into five groups: hookah-smoking rooms, rooms 
adjacent to where hookah was smoked, cigarette smoking rooms, rooms adjacent to where 
cigarettes were smoked and homes where there was neither hookah nor cigarette smoking. 
Statistical analyses were performed using Stata 14.0 (StataCorp, College Station, Texas, 
USA). Data were summarised with descriptive statistics (mean, range and 95% CIs). All 
outcome variables, that is, PM 2.5, BC and CO, were log-transformed to perform t-tests 
because they were not normally distributed as assessed by the Shapiro-Wilk test. Spearman’s 
rank correlation coefficient was used to apprise the correlation between PM2.5 levels and CO 
levels, the area of the smoking room, the number of active smokers and the number of 
hookahs or cigarettes smoked. A p value of ≤0.05 was considered statistically significant for 
all analyses.

 RESULTS
As noted, table 1 illustrates the number of smokers, the number of children in households, 
the number of hookahs or cigarettes smoked, ventilation during smoking sessions, sampling 
time, as well as the size of the room where smoking occurred during air quality assessment.
PM2.5, BC and CO levels were consistently higher in the hookah/cigarette smoking rooms 
compared to the adjacent non-smoking rooms (table 2). The levels of these pollutants were 
also greater than the values in the non-smoking homes.
When comparing pollutant levels from smoking rooms in hookah homes with smoking 
rooms in cigarettes homes, levels of CO were found to be significantly higher in the hookah 
smoking rooms. In rooms where hookahs were smoked and their adjacent non-smoking 
rooms, CO levels (table 2) were 4.8 and 3.6 times greater (11.0 vs 2.3 ppm, and 5.8 vs 1.6 
ppm), respectively, than in rooms where cigarettes were smoked and their adjacent non-
smoking rooms (p<0.05). They were also 7.3 and 3.9 times greater (11.0 vs 1.5 ppm and 5.8 
vs 1.5 ppm), respectively, than CO levels in rooms in non-smoking homes (p<0.05). 
Importantly, the mean level of CO in the non-smoking rooms in the hookah homes, 5.8 ppm, 
was more than twice as high as in the smoking rooms from cigarette homes, 2.3 ppm 
(p<0.05).
PM2.5 levels in the hookah smoking rooms varied widely among homes (95% CI 50.3 to 
806.9 mg/m3, table 1); the mean value was more than twice the PM2.5 levels in the cigarette 
smoking rooms although this difference was not statistically significant. PM2.5 levels in the 
cigarette smoking rooms were elevated above the levels in the adjacent rooms (201.2 vs 
96.7, p<0.05) while not being elevated compared to levels in non-smoking homes. In 
contrast, PM 2.5 levels in hookah smoking rooms were significantly higher than those in 
non-smoking homes (428.6 vs 91.2, p<0.05).
BC levels in hookah smoking rooms were not statistically different than adjacent rooms (5.4 
vs 3.7). The levels of BC in the cigarette smoking room were higher than the levels in the 
adjacent room (4.2 vs 3.0, p<0.05). Compared to the non-smoking homes, (1.5 ppm), BC 
levels were elevated in the smoking and adjacent rooms of the cigarette homes, but did not 
reach statistical significance (2.3 ppm for cigarette smoking rooms and 1.6 ppm for cigarette 
adjacent rooms, p<0.05). Mean BC concentrations were 2.5 times greater in hookah 
smoking rooms than in rooms in non-smoking homes (p<0.05). As seen in the hookah 
smoking room with the highest PM2.5 levels (figure 1), the baseline values were low, 
suggesting that other smoking products were not in use; this finding was consistent with 
other homes where hookahs were smoked. The observed increase in real-time PM2.5 and BC 
concentrations varied greatly, but in parallel, over time. Although the composition of the 
airborne PM2.5 was not extensively assessed in this study, the measurement of OC and EC 
levels suggest that EC made up a minor fraction of PM2.5, whereas OC accounted for 66% 
and 88% of the PM2.5 mass in the hookah and cigarette smoking homes, respectively.
Several individual home characteristics were evaluated for their effect on airborne PM2.5 
levels in the smoking room of the hookah and cigarette homes. The room area, number of 
active smokers and number of hookahs simultaneously smoked were not significantly

 correlated with the PM2.5 levels in the hookah homes and only the number of smoked 
cigarettes were correlated with PM2.5 in the cigarette homes.
DISCUSSION
The growing epidemic of hookah use is not exclusively nor primarily a US problem. It is a 
global problem, primarily emanating from the Middle East,4 and as a result, countries like 
the UAE have enacted a number of laws concerning tobacco use and hookah use in the past 
decade.32 Virtually all that we know to date about air quality and health effects of hookah 
use and exposure to hookah-related SHS, however, comes from studies conducted in settings 
other than homes where hookah is smoked.20252930 This is the first study that we are aware 
of that investigates multiple air pollutants in homes where hookahs are smoked, 
demonstrating potentially hazardously high levels of all pollutants assessed in rooms where 
hookah was smoked and in the adjacent rooms. Levels of these pollutants were higher in 
homes where hookah was smoked than in homes where cigarettes were smoked and levels of 
CO in the room adjacent to the one where hookah was smoked were even higher than in 
rooms where cigarettes were smoked.
PM2.5 levels in homes where nothing was smoked were markedly higher than the WHO’s 24 
hour guideline of 25 μg/m3 for outdoor air pollution, consistent with findings of poor air 
quality in homes and in the ambient environment in Dubai in general.33 Burning incense is 
common in the UAE and can be a source of indoor PM;34 however, it should be noted that 
although ~1/3 to 1/2 of the hookah and cigarette homes in this study reported the occasional, 
weekly or monthly use of incense, none was burned during this study. Concentrations of 
PM2.5 and BC in hookah smoking homes were higher than those found in cigarette-smoking 
and non-smoking homes, suggesting that in-home hookah smoking may pose similar or even 
worse cardiovascular and pulmonary risks to non-smokers living in such homes than SHS in 
homes where cigarettes are smoked. Toxicity of ambient particles depends, of course, on the 
composition of inhaled particles. Our analyses determined that the majority of PM2.5 in the 
hookah and cigarette homes was comprised of OC, whereas EC or BC made up only a small 
fraction of the total PM2.5. Thus, additional research is needed to assess the composition of 
secondhand hookah smoke when comparing its toxicity to that for secondhand cigarette 
smoke.
The WHO recommends that indoor CO levels not exceed 9 ppm for 8 hours or 26 ppm for 1 
hour.35 None of the sampled rooms demonstrated mean CO levels above the 1 hour guidance 
level. The present study demonstrates that hookah and cigarette smoke elevate indoor CO 
levels, but significantly more so with hookah smoke, resulting in CO levels several folds 
greater than the cigarette smoke and control concentrations. CO has been implicated to play 
a major role in a multitude of cardiovascular and airway diseases, including 
atherosclerosis,3637 cardiomyopathy,38 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,39 respiratory 
infections,40 asthma41 and cystic fibrosis.42 CO poisoning after hookah smoking has already 
been found in a number of case reports, with users presenting carboxyhaemoglobin levels 
34% higher than normal after hookah use,4344 syncope45 and confusion.46 It has been 
suggested that CO intoxication due to hookah smoking is likely to be more common than 
that was realised due to inefficient charcoal burning.3047 These findings suggest that the

 substitution of the burning charcoal with an electronic heating source may be beneficial in 
reducing CO levels during the use of hookahs.
The well-documented adverse health effects of cigarette SHS have been translated into 
extensive public health policy to protect non-smokers. As a result, 84% of adults11 and 75% 
teenagers48 recognise that SHS from cigarettes is harmful and believe that non-smokers 
should be protected from such exposure. However, comparable awareness and beliefs 
regarding SHS from hookah are severely lacking.4950 Owing to the lack of data concerning 
the dangers of SHS from hookah, the findings reported here, if corroborated and effectively 
communicated to the public, may significantly decrease hookah smoking in homes.
For the most part, the dangers and prevalence of hookah smoking in homes have been 
unexplored, and it is likely that homes are the most common place where children are 
exposed to SHS from hookahs. In one study, children living in homes with hookah use were 
12% more likely to report wheezing and nasal congestion.14 Another study found that 
children living in homes of hookah smokers are at risk of exposure to nicotine and 4-
(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone, a tobacco-specific carcinogen.31 Thus, these 
studies and the current study demonstrate that the air quality is poor inside homes where 
hookahs have been used and that adverse health effects, similar to those seen in children 
exposed to cigarette SHS, are likely to occur.
Hookah smokers appear to generally smoke hookah in their homes although there is 
admittedly only a few studies on this and on the extent and dangers of home hookah use. 
Among college students at one university, 78% of hookah smokers surveyed reported 
smoking hookah in their homes, whereas at a different university, 43% reported that the 
home was their primary location for smoking hookah.1950 The present study provides data 
that all children and adults in a hookah-smoking household are exposed to hazardous levels 
of CO and PM2.5. Prior studies have shown that SHS can transfer between units in a 
multiunit housing building5152 via open windows, doors and vents, exposing unaware non-
smokers. Thus, it would be prudent that emerging multiunit housing smoke-free policies 
should also be extended to hookah smoking.
In comparison to cigarette smoking homes and consistent with previous studies,26 the rooms 
where hookah is smoked and the adjacent rooms exhibited higher concentrations of CO, 
PM2.5 and BC than cigarette-smoking homes and control homes. Interestingly, air quality 
levels in the smoking rooms and adjacent rooms in hookah-smoking homes were found to be 
similar with those of hookah bars with multiple smokers and little to no ventilation.2530
There are a number of limitations to the present study. The study was limited by a small 
sample size and the use of a convenience sample, thus limiting generalisability. Air 
collection was initiated just prior to smoking so the temporal change in PM2.5 and BC was 
able to be captured (figure 1), although air sampling was not conducted for a long term after 
termination of smoking, leaving unanswered how long the indoor air quality stayed at 
dangerous levels and what concentration of pollutants continued to contaminate the adjacent 
rooms. Given that the baseline values for PM2.5 and BC were very low compared to the 
rapid rise after smoking was initiated (figure 1) suggests that any potential carryover from

 prior use of smoking products would have had minimal effect on the results of this study. 
Future studies should measure, in real time, pollutant and nicotine levels prior to and after 
smoking as well as integrative sampling to evaluate daily total exposures to secondhand 
hookah smoke in the home.
Importantly, hookah smokers usually smoke less frequently per day in comparison to 
cigarette smokers but for a longer time period per smoking session53 and it is unclear how 
this difference in smoking patterns affects the accumulation and dissipation of pollutants in 
hookah SHS. Additional factors that may have affected the observed inter-home variability 
in indoor air quality include ventilation factors, such as windows, doors and air conditioning, 
the types of cigarette, shisha and charcoal being used, air exchange rate, the size of the 
rooms and the amount of time smoking occurred, although such factors were not correlated 
with airborne PM2.5 levels in the hookah smoking homes in the present study. Future efforts 
are needed with larger sample sizes and controlled hookah and cigarette products. 
Furthermore, these data are limited to one region of the world and because shisha and 
hookah smoking protocols are not yet standardised, more research is needed to determine 
whether the above results are generalisable to hookah used in other areas of the world.
To the best of our knowledge, however, this is the first study to assess the indoor air quality 
of hookah smoking homes in comparison to cigarette smoking homes and non-smoking 
homes. The findings provide evidence that hookah smoking generates levels of SHS that are 
potentially hazardous to the health of others in their homes, and particularly pose potentially 
serious threats to children’s long-term health. Given the UAE’s current attention to Clean 
Air Acts and tobacco regulation, a paper such as this, demonstrating the danger of indoor 
hooking smoking, conducted in the country, is likely to have a marked effect. The US 
Surgeon General concluded that no safe level of SHS exists and the home is the primary 
source of SHS exposure for children and non-smokers.952 Eliminating smoking in indoor 
spaces is the only effective way to fully protect non-smokers from the effects of SHS 
exposure. Given the results presented here coupled with the more extensive literature 
demonstrating remarkably poor air quality in hookah bars, it seems judicious for public 
health efforts, regulatory and educational, to include home hookah smoking as a danger not 
only to the hookah smoker but also to others passively exposed to the combustion products 
of hookah smoke regardless of whether they actually go into the room where hookah is 
smoked.

 What this paper adds
This study is the first of its kind to demonstrate potentially hazardous levels of home air 
pollution in rooms where hookahs are being smoked as well as in adjacent rooms. These 
levels were greater than those in cigarette smoking homes, raising concerns about 
potential negative health effects on all individuals living in homes where hookahs are 
smoked. It seems judicious for public health efforts, regulatory and educational, to 
include home hookah smoking as a danger not only to the hookah smoker but also to 
others passively exposed to the combustion products of hookah smoke regardless of 
whether they actually go into the room where hookah is smoked.
