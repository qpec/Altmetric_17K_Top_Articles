The microbiome can promote or disrupt human health by influencing both adaptive and innate immune functions.
We tested whether bacteria that normally reside on human skin participate in host defense by killing Staphylococcus
aureus, a pathogen commonly found in patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) and an important factor that exacer-
bates this disease. High-throughput screening for antimicrobial activity against S. aureus was performed on isolates
of coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (CoNS) collected from the skin of healthy and AD subjects. CoNS strains with
antimicrobial activity were common on the normal population but rare on AD subjects. A low frequency of strains
with antimicrobial activity correlated with colonization by S. aureus. The antimicrobial activity was identified as pre-
viously unknown antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) produced by CoNS species including Staphylococcus epidermidis and
Staphylococcus hominis. These AMPs were strain-specific, highly potent, selectively killed S. aureus, and synergized
with the human AMP LL-37. Application of these CoNS strains to mice confirmed their defense function in vivo
relative to application of nonactive strains. Strikingly, reintroduction of antimicrobial CoNS strains to human subjects
with AD decreased colonization by S. aureus. These findings show how commensal skin bacteria protect against
pathogens and demonstrate how dysbiosis of the skin microbiome can lead to disease.
INTRODUCTION
Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are essential immune defense mole-
cules produced by neutrophils, paneth cells, mast cells, epithelial cells,
and adipocytes (1–4). Because of their direct antimicrobial action,
AMPs control growth of microorganisms that normally reside on ep-
ithelial surfaces, a community of microbes referred to as the “micro-
biome” (5). The skin microbiome is also regulated by other ecological
factors such as humidity, temperature, pH, and lipid content (6). As a
consequence of the environment established by the host, only a
restricted collection of microbes can normally colonize the epithelial
surface. However, in some disease states, an altered balance of the mi-
crobiota can occur, a condition known as dysbiosis. This state of dys-
biosis may contribute to the disruption of immune homeostasis and
increase disease symptoms. For example, atopic dermatitis (AD) is a
disease characterized by dry, itchy, and inflamed skin that is frequently
subject to infections of the skin and has been clearly shown to have an
altered skin bacterial flora when compared to non-AD subjects (7, 8).
Although it is not clear why this occurs, the skin of subjects with AD
has a decreased capacity to express certain AMPs such as cathelicidins
and b-defensins despite the presence of skin inflammation (9–13). This
relative deficiency in AMPs has been proposed to result in an inability
of the skin to resist growth of pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus.
The high abundance of S. aureus in AD contributes to the patho-
physiology of this disease and has been linked with immune dys-
function including T helper cell 2 lymphocyte skewing (14), reduced
AMPs (12, 15), exacerbated allergic reactions (16, 17), and disruption
of the skin barrier (18). Mice develop AD-like lesions when they are
experimentally colonized by S. aureus (19, 20). However, in contrast to
the exacerbation of disease and inflammation caused by S. aureus, oth-
er bacterial species found on normal skin appear to aid in normal im-
mune homeostasis (21). For example, Staphylococcus epidermidis, a
prevalent species of bacteria on healthy human skin, can diminish in-
flammation after injury (22), enhance development of cutaneous T cells
(23–25), and promote expression of AMPs (23, 24, 26–28). Further-
more, some bacteria have been shown to produce their own AMPs that
can synergize with AMPs produced by mammalian cells (29, 30).
Here, we hypothesized that normal human skin is populated by
commensal bacteria that promote health by producing antimicro-
bial activity. Furthermore, we asked whether a deficiency of this com-
munity in AD might exacerbate disease by facilitating the survival of
S. aureus. We report a discovery of a broad community of protective
bacteria on normal human skin that provides host defense against pa-
thogens. These observations offer a specific strategy for rational micro-
biome therapy.
RESULTS
Bacteria on normal human skin inhibit S. aureus but are
infrequent in AD
We performed 16S rRNA gene sequencing and culture-based analysis
of skin swabs taken from healthy non-AD subjects and the lesional and

 nonlesional sites of subjects with AD (refer to table S1 for demographic
data). A large proportion of subjects with AD were identified to be
culture-positive for S. aureus on both their lesional and nonlesional
skin (Fig. 1A). S. aureus culture–positive lesional skin had decreased
bacterial diversity when compared to lesional skin that was S. aureus
culture–negative (Fig. 1B and fig. S1). Principal coordinate analysis
using weighted UniFrac distances suggested a similarity in the bac-
terial communities of non-AD controls and S. aureus–positive and
S. aureus–negative AD subjects (Fig. 1C). The absolute abundance of
total staphylococcal species on skin swabs was also evaluated by man-
ual colony counting for colony-forming units (CFUs) on a selective
egg yolk mannitol salt agar (fig. S2A) and by quantitative polymer-
ase chain reaction (qPCR) of bacterial DNA with genus-specific 16S
primers to yield a relative CFU (rCFU) based on DNA abundance (fig.
S2B). Swabs to quantify live bacteria and bacterial DNA were simul-
taneously obtained from the area next to each other. The specificity of
the Staphylococcus-specific primers was confirmed as shown in fig. S3.
Both colony counting and 16S rDNA qPCR methods gave similar
results from samples from AD lesional skin. However, these methods
yielded different results on samples from normal skin where qPCR of
DNA abundance detected about 10-fold higher rCFUs than live col-
ony counting (Fig. 1D). One explanation for the larger amount of
DNA recovered from normal skin compared to AD skin was that
DNA recovered from normal skin was associated with bacteria that
had been killed by the normal antimicrobial defense systems on the
skin surface environment. This observation led us to hypothesize
that bacteria residing on the skin of AD subjects had less antimicro-
bial activity than those on normal skin.
Previous studies have found that laboratory isolates of coagulase-
negative Staphylococcus (CoNS) species can produce AMPs (29, 30).
We therefore next sought to determine the frequency of CoNS strains
that produce antimicrobial activity on normal skin. To detect antimi-
crobial activity, we randomly isolated about 80 individual CoNS isolates
from each skin culture swab and then conducted an unbiased analysis
of antimicrobial activity by measuring the capacity of the sterile
conditioned supernatant of each individual isolate to inhibit S. aureus
growth (Fig. 2A). A total of 2029 colonies were studied from the fore-
arms of 30 healthy subjects, and 5695 colonies were studied from

Downloaded from 
 nonlesional and lesional skin of 49 subjects with AD. This functional
screening revealed that most CoNS clones isolated from healthy subjects
could inhibit S. aureus growth, but CoNS clones with antimicrobial ac-
tivity were much less frequent on AD subjects and were lowest on in-
dividuals who were S. aureus culture–positive (Fig. 2, B and C). Low
frequency of CoNS with antimicrobial activity was also seen in the only
healthy subject that was S. aureus culture–positive. The measurement of
frequency of clones with anti–S. aureus activity was stable in multiple
skin swab samples from the same subjects over 14 days (fig. S4). No
subject that was culture-positive for S. aureus had antimicrobial activity
detected in more than 50% of their CoNS isolates (Fig. 2D). This sug-
gested that a deficiency in the antimicrobial function of the CoNS bac-
terial community was strongly associated with colonization by S. aureus.
To identify the bacteria that had antimicrobial activity, full-length
16S rRNA gene sequencing was performed on active clones (refer to
table S2 for the number of clones analyzed). The predominant spe-
cies of CoNS with anti–S. aureus activity was either S. epidermidis or
Staphylococcus hominis, although other species were also observed with
this activity (Fig. 3A and table S2, A and B). However, many clones of
these CoNS species did not produce antimicrobial activity, thus dem-
onstrating that the strain, and not only species identity, predicts anti-
microbial function (Fig. 3B and table S2B).
Application of antimicrobial CoNS strains to skin
inhibits S. aureus
To confirm that the antimicrobial function detected through random
screening in vitro could be reproduced under the physiologically rele-
vant conditions of the skin, the S. hominis clone A9 was selected for
further analysis. This strain was selected because S. hominis was fre-
quently detected in our screen, and the function of S. hominis on hu-
man skin was unknown. S. hominis A9 grown on agar generated a
clear zone of inhibition of S. aureus growth, thus confirming that this
strain spontaneously secreted activity into culture medium at a level
sufficient to directly inhibit S. aureus (Fig. 4A). To directly test whether
this clone could reduce colonization by S. aureus on the skin, we ap-
plied S. hominis A9 or an equal density of control S. hominis isolates
without antimicrobial activity to the surface of sanitized pigskin (31)
on which a defined amount of S. aureus had first been applied. The
amount of S. hominis applied was similar to the estimated density of
bacteria on normal human skin (1 × 105 CFU/cm2). A significant de-
crease in S. aureus was seen after a single application of S. hominis A9
at this density (P = 0.0276; Fig. 4B). Application of S. hominis A9 that
was killed before application or application of control S. hominis
strains that did not show antimicrobial activity did not reduce S. aureus
survival. Similarly, after colonization of the back skin of mice with

 a known amount of S. aureus, a single application of S. hominis A9
reduced S. aureus but control strains of S. hominis had no effect (Fig.
4C). Furthermore, twice-a-day applications of S. hominis A9 for 1 week
completely eliminated S. aureus colonization compared to vehicle (Fig.
4D). Vehicle treatment did not affect S. aureus survival on the skin
surface in comparison to untreated control (fig. S5). These observa-
tions show that S. hominis A9 produced anti–S. aureus activity when
present on the skin and prompted further biochemical and genetic
identification of the molecule(s) responsible for this activity.
Commensal bacteria on human skin produce AMPs
Reverse-phase chromatography revealed two independent peaks with
antimicrobial activity in the conditioned medium of S. hominis A9
(Fig. 5A and fig. S6). Edman degradation, whole-genome sequencing,
and genome-guided matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization–time-
of-flight (MALDI-TOF)/TOF analyses predicted the structures for the
mature forms of these AMPs as lantibiotics (Fig. 5B and fig. S7). These
proteins were encoded within a gene cluster that included lanM, lanC,
and lanT homologs (Fig. 5, C and D), and were duplicated within the
genome, but not detected within the genome of another S. hominis
strain previously sequenced (32). Because these S. hominis AMPs
had similar structure to known lantibiotics (33), we refer to them
henceforth as Sh-lantibiotic-a and Sh-lantibiotic-b. To validate the an-
timicrobial function of Sh-lantibiotic-a and Sh-lantibiotic-b on skin,
we applied 0.5 nmol of purified Sh-lantibiotics to sanitized pigskin
to which S. aureus had been previously applied. Direct application
of these Sh-lantibiotic peptides to skin, or application of sterile con-
ditioned culture medium from S. hominis A9, significantly inhibited
S. aureus (P < 0.01; Fig. 5E). In contrast, these Sh-lantibiotics did not
act against S. hominis A9 itself at concentrations up to 10 mM (Fig.
5F). S. hominis A9 strongly suppressed growth of multiple strains of
S. aureus, including MRSA strain USA 300, and clinical isolates from
subjects with AD but did not affect growth of other species frequent-
ly isolated from normal human skin, including Propionibacterium
acnes, S. epidermidis, and Corynebacterium minutissimum (fig. S8).
Identification of the genes encoding Sh-lantibiotics permitted us
to screen subjects by direct colony PCR to determine the frequency
of this AMP in the CoNS community residing on the skin of human
subjects. PCR analysis was performed on 632 CoNS colonies from the
skin of 9 randomly selected normal subjects and 1713 CoNS colonies
from 11 randomly selected individuals with AD. These results showed
that the Sh-lantibiotic-a genes were common in the bacterial communi-
ty on normal subjects but not on AD subjects (Fig. 6A), a finding
consistent with our functional screening results shown earlier in Fig.
2. Western blot analysis using mouse polyclonal immunoglobulin G
raised against Sh-lantibiotic-a peptide showed that the peptide could
be detected on the skin of non-AD subjects that were PCR-positive
for the Sh-lantibiotic-a gene, but not on AD subjects that were PCR-
negative (Fig. 6B and fig. S9), thus confirming that the protein for this
lantibiotic was constitutively expressed on human skin and correlated
with the presence of the gene. These Sh-lantibiotics were likely not the
only antimicrobials produced by the skin microbiome because genome
sequencing of additional clones selected by functional screening revealed
other putative lantibiotic and bacteriocin genes in other active isolates
(fig. S10). We also identified previously known lantibiotics, such as epi-
dermin and Pep-5 (34), in the genomes of some S. epidermidis clones with
anti–S. aureus activity isolated from normal skin (fig. S11). Lantibiotic-
related genes were not found in the genomes of strains that did not
exhibit antimicrobial activity such as S. hominis C4, C5, and C6.
Sh-lantibiotics synergize with a human AMP
The human skin expresses several human AMPs, and therefore, these
host AMPs will be present together with the bacterial Sh-lantibiotics
on the skin surface. This shared location raised the potential that the
bacterial AMPs may act with human AMPs to defend against patho-
gens. To examine this, we combined each Sh-lantibiotic with LL-37, a
mammalian AMP of the cathelicidin family. Sh-lantibiotic-a and
Sh-lantibiotic-b showed strong activity alone and had superior ac-
tivity against S. aureus compared to known human AMPs (Fig. 6, C and
D) (35). LL-37 alone (8 mM) decreased S. aureus survival by >3-log,
whereas 4 mM LL-37 alone did not affect S. aureus survival in vitro.
Combination with 4 and 8 mM LL-37, concentrations consistent with
those measured on human skin, enhanced the antimicrobial activ-
ity of each Sh-lantibiotic by 4-fold (with 4 mM LL-37) and 16-fold
(Sh-lantibiotic-a with 8 mM LL-37) or 32-fold (Sh-lantibiotic-b with
8 mM LL-37), respectively, suggesting synergistic action between pro-
karyotic and host AMPs.

 CoNS colonies were screened. Only a single S. epidermidis or S. hominis
strain with antimicrobial activity was isolated from the three subjects. In
these cases, a single strain of CoNS was formulated (refer to Fig. 7A).
Three and two antimicrobial S. hominis or S. epidermidis strains were
isolated from two AD subjects. The whole genome of each active clone
was sequenced, and clusters of lantibiotic- or bacteriocin-related genes
were identified in all active clones (Fig. 7A and fig. S10). All selected
clones and their conditioned media were confirmed to produce a zone
of inhibition of S. aureus growth by radial diffusion assay (Fig. 7B).
These clones with antimicrobial activity were then expanded and for-
mulated in a cream vehicle base (Cetaphil lotion), and a single dose was
applied in a double-blind fashion to the forearm of each subject,
whereas vehicle alone was applied to the contralateral arm (autologous
transplant) (refer to fig. S12 for study design). Bacteria were applied to
the skin for a final concentration of 1 × 105 CFU/cm2, a density similar
to previous assessments of the abundance of bacteria on normal human
skin. Subjects were instructed not to wash for 24 hours after applica-
tion. S. aureus was measured at each site before and 24 hours after
application of active CoNS transplant or vehicle. To assess potential
vehicle effects, we left some subjects untreated. Twenty-four hours af-
ter initiation of the study, no significant difference in S. aureus abun-
dance was detected between untreated individuals and individuals
treated with vehicle alone (Fig. 7C), although in the absence of wash-
ing, a trend toward an increase in bacterial abundance from baseline
was seen in both untreated and vehicle-treated groups (fig. S13). In
contrast, a single application of antimicrobial CoNS strain(s) signifi-
cantly decreased S. aureus abundance compared to vehicle (P =
0.0402; Fig. 7C and fig. S13). These data confirmed that CoNS strains
with antimicrobial activity can directly suppress S. aureus colonization
on human subjects with AD.
DISCUSSION
AD is a common and severe skin disorder that harbors an abnormal
community of bacteria on the skin. In particular, patients with AD
are frequently colonized by S. aureus that then exacerbates the dis-
ease by further promoting inflammation (7, 8). We hypothesized
that the commensal bacteria residing on normal skin might contrib-
ute to host defense by producing molecules that inhibit colonization
by S. aureus. Furthermore, we examined whether the dysbiosis seen
in AD may be functionally important because of a loss of these pro-
tective strains. We observed that several different bacterial species on
healthy human skin produce anti–S. aureus activity and that bacteria
with this activity were far less frequent on AD subjects. The relative

 absence of commensal bacterial strains producing antimicrobial activ-
ity was most evident on individuals colonized by S. aureus. Indeed, no
subject was colonized by S. aureus if they also had a normal abun-
dance of CoNS bacteria that produced antimicrobial activity, and
application of antimicrobial CoNS strains to animal or human skin
greatly reduced S. aureus colonization. Together, these observations
show that specific bacteria within the human skin microbiome defend
against S. aureus.
In normal skin, culture-based methods for estimating CFU detected
a lower abundance of bacteria than DNA-based methods. This was not
likely to be inherent to the techniques themselves because the two
methods yielded similar results when samples were taken from AD le-
sional skin. There are several potential explanations for this observation,
including differences in capacity to sample bacterial DNA on AD le-
sional skin compared to healthy skin, or other products in the samples
influencing the assay results. However, it is also possible that more
bacteria on normal skin are dead than on AD lesional skin. Indeed,
we have shown here that normal skin has more effective surface anti-
microbial activity than AD skin. AMPs such as LL-37, b-defensin-2,
and b-defensin-3 also have lesser expression in inflamed skin of AD
patients than in inflamed skin of normal subjects, but the constitutive
expression of these AMPs is low in noninflamed skin (10–13, 36).
Therefore, the increased capacity of noninflamed normal skin to kill
bacteria is not likely due to the expression of these host AMPs. Alter-
natively, the higher antimicrobial activity generated by the commensal
CoNS community on normal skin can explain this increased surface
antimicrobial action. In this model, the microbiome provides the first
line of defense, whereas the host innate immune system provides the
second line of defense, which is activated only after the surface is dam-
aged to trigger host AMP production.
Unbiased functional selection of commensal CoNS strains that
were prevalent on human skin permitted identification of previously
unknown AMPs. We report purification and validation of two potent
lantibiotics in a common commensal strain of S. hominis. These lan-
tibiotics were constitutively secreted by bacteria at concentrations that
are sufficient to kill S. aureus on the skin surface, detectable on the
surface of normal human skin, and highly synergistic with LL-37,
an important human AMP (2, 37). The synergistic action between
prokaryotic and host AMPs suggests that the microbe-derived mole-
cules should be considered as a component of the normal skin im-
mune defense system. Several other bacterial species were also
found to produce antimicrobial activity. Although Gram-negative
bacteria have been rarely detected on normal human skin, it has been
reported recently that selective culture systems could successfully ex-
pand some Gram-negative bacteria from healthy donors and that
these could suppress S. aureus growth on AD subjects (38). It is un-
clear whether the presence of such Gram-negative bacteria influences
normal host defense. Furthermore, other potential activities detected
in laboratory strains of bacteria such as the capacity to inhibit biofilm
formation (39) may also play a role in normal skin protection. A lim-
itation of this current study is that a complete catalog of protective
bacteria cannot be identified at this time. A wide range of microbes
may have this function, and factors that influence their survival are
not currently understood. Overall, these data suggest that the human
skin microbiome could provide a diverse array of beneficial factors
that may require functional screening to first detect.
The Sh-lantibiotics identified here showed selective activity
against S. aureus but did not inhibit the growth of S. hominis and
S. epidermidis. Other isolates of CoNS also exerted selective antimicro-
bial activity against S. aureus but not against bacterial species fre-
quently found on the healthy skin. Previously identified AMPs from
S. epidermidis were also known to exert selective killing, a logical be-
havior if the cell is to resist killing itself (30). The mechanism responsible

 for selective killing by bacterial AMPs may be due to differences in the
capacity to disrupt the microbial cell membrane. The capacity for selec-
tive killing of pathogenic bacteria over the normal microflora is highly
desirable because it will help to shape the normal bacterial community.
This illustrates the potential in further analysis of the host defense
function of the human skin microbiome and is consistent with obser-
vations that expression of a bacteriocin in the intestinal microbiome
can outcompete pathogens at the epithelial interface (40). Because we
found that antimicrobial function of skin bacteria is not predictable at
the species level, more detailed metagenomic (41), transcriptomic (42),
proteomic, and metabolomic analyses (43, 44) will provide a more
complete understanding of the diverse antibacterial defense system
of the skin.
We have shown here in both animal and human systems that
topical application of rationally selected bacterial strains can decrease
S. aureus abundance. This approach is inherently superior to current
pharmaceutically derived antibiotics because they should not disrupt
cutaneous homeostasis by nonspecific killing of the normal micro-
flora. On the basis of our observations, nonspecific antibacterial
action by common pharmaceutical antibiotics could kill protective
strains of CoNS and might therefore enhance the potential for re-
colonization by S. aureus. The selective activity of antimicrobials
derived from normal flora would avoid this nonspecific effect and
illustrates why bacteriotherapy that kills S. aureus but does not in-
hibit other beneficial CoNS strains could be superior. Thus,
application of a single selective CoNS AMP may permit emergence
of multiple different AMPs, an environment less likely to promote an-
tibiotic resistance to any single antibiotic. Long-term protection could
be achieved if the applied antimicrobial bacteria could successfully col-
onize on the skin surface. We demonstrated that repeated application
of active CoNS for 1 week completely eliminated S. aureus on mice.
The benefits of long-term/multiple applications of antimicrobial
bacteria on the skin of subjects with AD remain to be determined.
Enhancing the presence of certain CoNS strains could benefit
the patient by also exerting anti-inflammatory actions. For example,
S. epidermidis has been shown to be anti-inflammatory (22, 25). Given
the complex nature of AD, ideal bacteriotherapy would include both
targeting repair of the intrinsic epidermal barrier and optimizing the
immune defense functions provided by the resident bacteria. Some
members of normal skin flora may be able to do both (22–26, 29, 30).
Extended periods of bacteriotherapy will be necessary to evaluate
this effect.
In conclusion, we report here evidence that the community of
bacteria residing on normal human skin provides protection against
S. aureus. A lack of this activity on the skin of subjects with AD is
strongly associated with increased colonization by S. aureus. It is not
clear at present whether this dysfunction of the bacterial community
in AD was an intrinsic result of the disease itself or whether it is
attributed to extrinsic factors in subjects with AD such as
environmental exposure or the action of other members of the AD
bacterial community to suppress commensal microbes that are ben-
eficial and in turn resist S. aureus. The presence of S. aureus may also
be contributing to the suppression of the protective strains of CoNS
identified here. However, with the identification of unique antimi-
crobials and bacterial strains from healthy human skin, it is possible
to exploit this information in diagnostically and therapeutically use-
ful ways. Such observations will further define the important mutu-
alistic relationship that exists between humans and some bacteria at
the epithelial interface.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
This study was designed to test the hypothesis that the skin commen-
sal bacteria contribute to the host defense by producing molecules that
can kill S. aureus. Adults with AD and age-matched non-AD subjects
were recruited from the University of California, San Diego (UCSD),
La Jolla, CA, and the National Jewish Health (NJH), Denver, CO
(demographic data are shown in table S1). All subjects avoided any
treatments and therapies that may potentially affect skin microbiome
before sample collection (refer to the Supplementary Materials for
sampling collection criteria). Collection of surface bacteria was done
from lesional skin on the antecubital fossa and from nonlesional skin
of the upper arm. Microbial communities on the skin surface of healthy
subjects and patients with AD were evaluated by culture-based colony
counting, qPCR, and 16S rRNA community sequencing. Antimicrobial
activity of CoNS isolated from the skin of healthy subjects and patients
with AD was measured against S. aureus by high-throughput screening.
The species of CoNS with or without anti–S. aureus activity were iden-
tified by 16S rRNA sequence. Antimicrobial activity produced by repre-
sentative CoNS strain isolated from a non-AD healthy subject was
characterized by liquid chromatography, MALDI-TOF/TOF MS,
Edman end-terminal sequencing, and genome sequencing. To test the
therapeutic potential of CoNS strains with anti–S. aureus activity, active
strains were applied at physiologically relevant density on ex situ pigskin
or mouse skin colonized by S. aureus. To further investigate the anti-
microbial activity of CoNS in human, CoNS strains with anti–S. aureus
activity were autologously reapplied to the lesional skin of one arm of
the AD subject, whereas vehicle only was applied to the contralateral
arm. All treatment was conducted in a double-blinded fashion and un-
blinded after all results were analyzed. No power analysis was per-
formed to predetermine sample size. The number of experimental
replications is provided in the figure legends. The details of all protocols
and all primary data for experiments where n < 20 (table S5) are
provided in the Supplementary Materials.
Human subjects
All experiments involving human subjects were carried out according
to the institutional review board protocols approved by UCSD (project
no. 071032) and NJH (HS-2581). Informed consent was obtained
from all subjects.
Screening for antimicrobial activity
Up to 84 individual isolated colonies of CoNS from each skin site were
randomly picked and cultured in TSB at 37°C overnight. Each plate
also contained wells with a nonantimicrobial strain of S. epidermidis
(ATCC1457) as negative control and a potent antimicrobial strain of
S. hominis (A9 strain) as positive control. The antimicrobial activity
of sterile conditioned medium prepared from each CoNS culture was
evaluated by mixing with 1 × 104 CFU of S. aureus (ATCC35556).
Antimicrobial strains were defined as those that suppressed S. aureus
growth after 22 hours to less than 50% (I50) of growth seen in neg-
ative controls.
Transplantation of antimicrobial CoNS on mice and
ex situ pigskin
All experiments involving live animal work were in accordance
with the approval of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Guidelines
of the University of California, San Diego (protocol no. S09074).
Fresh-frozen pigskin was purchased as sheets and was sanitized by

 3% chloroxylenol and rinsed with sterile phosphate-buffered saline.
For mouse experiments, the backs of female C57BL6 mice (6 weeks
old) were shaved. S. aureus was then epicutaneously applied on the
dorsal skin of mice or pigskin at the indicated CFU density. S. hominis
A9 strain or inactive strains were subsequently applied on the skin
for 20 hours. Live bacteria were harvested by swabbing to measure
S. aureus survival.
Autologous microbiome transplant
The approach of AMT for subjects with AD has been officially ap-
proved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and this protocol
has been filed as an investigational new drug application (UCSD ap-
proval no. 15786). This trial has been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov
(NCT01959113). AD subjects who are S. aureus carriers on the le-
sional sites of both antecubital fossa were screened. CoNS strains with
anti–S. aureus activity were screened from the nonlesional site and
identified by 16S rRNA sequencing. Each CoNS strain was expanded
in TSB overnight and formulated at 1 × 107 CFU/g in Cetaphil lotion
(Galderma). When multiple strains were included, an equal CFU of each
CoNS was formulated at a total concentration of 1 × 107 CFU/g. One
arm was treated with AMT formulation to get CoNS (1 × 105 CFU/cm2)
on the target skin. The other arm received an equal amount of mois-
turizer only. S. aureus CFU was measured before and 24 hours af-
ter transplant.
Statistical analysis
Paired t tests (two-tailed) were used to compare lesional to nonlesional
samples within AD subjects, and independent t tests (two-tailed) were
used to compare non-AD to AD samples. For nonnormally distribut-
ed variables such as CoNS with Sh-antibiotic-a frequency, non-
parametric approaches such as Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney tests for
non-AD to AD samples and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests for lesional
to nonlesional samples within AD subjects were used. Longitudinal
mixed models of frequency of antimicrobial CoNS and the ratio of
live Staphylococcus to Staphylococcus DNA over time were also fit.
Each model included lesion type, visit, and their interaction term as
fixed effects, whereas a compound symmetry structure was used to
account for correlation between samples obtained from the same sub-
ject at multiple time points. Frequency of antimicrobial CoNS used a
cumulative logit link and multinomial distribution of categorized per-
centages (≤20, 21–79, ≥80) to account for a bimodal distribution. Sta-
tistical analyses were performed using SAS software (version 9.3) and
R software (version 3.1.1).
