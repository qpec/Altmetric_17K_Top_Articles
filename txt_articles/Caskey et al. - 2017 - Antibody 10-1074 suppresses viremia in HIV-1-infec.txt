Abstract
Monoclonal antibody 10-1074 targets the V3 glycan supersite on the HIV-1 envelope protein. It is 
among the most potent anti-HIV-1 neutralizing antibodies isolated to date. Here we report on its 
safety and activity in 33 subjects who received a single intravenous infusion of the antibody. 
10-1074 was well tolerated with a half-life of 24.0 days in uninfected and 12.8 days in HIV-1-
infected subjects. 13 viremic subjects received the highest dose of 30 mg/kg 10-1074. 11 of these 
participants were 10-1074-sensitive and showed a rapid decline of viremia by a mean of 1.52 log10 
copies/ml. Virologic analysis revealed the emergence of multiple independent 10-1074-resistant 
viruses within the first weeks after infusion. Emerging escape variants were generally resistant to 
the related V3-specific antibody PGT121, but remained sensitive to antibodies targeting non-
overlapping epitopes, such as the anti-CD4 binding site antibodies 3BNC117 and VRC01. The 
results demonstrate the safety and activity of 10-1074 in humans and support the idea that 
antibodies targeting the V3 glycan supersite may be useful for treatment and prevention of HIV-1 
infection.
Introduction
A small fraction of HIV-1-infected individuals develop antibodies that effectively neutralize 
the majority of existing HIV-1 isolates1–7. Single cell antibody cloning methods revealed 
that this serum neutralizing activity is due to one or a combination of monoclonal antibodies 
that target different non-overlapping epitopes on the HIV-1 envelope spike1,3,5,6. These sites 
of vulnerability include the membrane proximal region8–10, the base of the V3 loop and 
surrounding glycans11–14, the V1/V2 loops at the apex15,16, the CD4 binding site17–19, and a 
series of epitopes that span gp120 and gp4120,21.
When passively transferred, many of these newly discovered antibodies protect against 
infection in humanized mice and macaques, even when present at very low 
concentrations22–25. In addition, combinations of antibodies targeting non-overlapping 
epitopes can control active infection in humanized mice and macaques26–29. Finally, when 
they are administered together with agents that induce viral transcription to activate latently 
infected cells, antibodies decrease the incidence of viral rebound from the latent reservoir in 
HIV-1-infected humanized mice30. These effects are in part dependent on the ability of 
antibodies to engage the host immune system by binding to Fc receptors expressed on a 
variety of host leukocytes30–33.
These preclinical findings were extended to humans in two separate phase 1 clinical trials. A 
single intravenous injection of an anti-CD4 binding site antibody, 3BNC117 or VRC01, was 
generally safe and suppressed viremia by 0.8 to 2.5 log10 in participants infected with a

 virus that was sensitive to the antibody34–36. Moreover, 3BNC117 infusion was associated 
with enhanced Fc receptor-dependent clearance of infected cells and increased breadth and 
potency of host anti-HIV-1 antibody responses33,37. Finally, in participants that carried 
sensitive viruses, administration of 2 or 4 3BNC117 30mg/kg infusions significantly delayed 
viral rebound during interruption of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and resulted in viral 
suppression for 6.7 or 9.9 weeks, respectively38. However, both 3BNC117 and VRC01 
recognize the same target on the HIV-1 envelope protein, and whether bNAbs that target 
additional epitopes on the HIV-1 spike are safe and clinically effective has not been 
determined.
Results
10-1074 shows a favorable pharmacokinetic profile and is well tolerated
10-1074 is a highly potent anti-HIV-1 antibody isolated from an HIV-1 clade A-infected 
individual11. It targets a carbohydrate-dependent epitope in the V3 loop of the HIV-1 
envelope spike11,14. When tested against large panels of HIV-1 pseudoviruses in TZM.bl 
neutralization assays in vitro, 10-1074 neutralizes 60.5% of 306 strains comprising 13 
subtypes and 88.5% of 26 clade B strains at an average 80% inhibitory concentration (IC80) 
of 0.18 μg/ml and 0.13 μg/ml, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 1a, c)39. When tested 
against primary HIV-1 isolates from 179 HIV-1-infected individuals (77 off and 102 on 
antiretroviral therapy, ART) living in the United States or in Germany, 77.7% of cultures 
were neutralized with a mean IC80 of 0.67 μg/ml (Supplementary Fig. 1b,c).
To determine whether 10-1074 is safe and has antiviral activity in humans, we performed an 
open label phase 1 first-in-human clinical trial. 14 uninfected and 19 HIV-1-infected 
individuals (3 on ART, 16 off ART) received a single intravenous infusion of 10-1074 at 
doses of 3, 10, or 30 mg/kg (Fig. 1a, Table 1, Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary 
Table 1). The antibody was generally safe and well tolerated in all participants. No grade 3, 
4, or serious treatment-related adverse events, or significant laboratory abnormalities were 
observed during a follow-up period of up to 168 days (total of 5,447 patient-days, 
Supplementary Table 2).
10-1074 serum levels were determined by TZM.bl neutralization assay, which measures the 
amount of active antibody in the serum (Supplementary Table 3)34,40–42. Similar to 
3BNC11734,35, 10-1074 was eliminated more rapidly in HIV-1-infected individuals than in 
uninfected participants (Fig. 1B), resulting in a t1/2 of 24.0 and 12.8 days in uninfected and 
HIV-1-infected subjects, respectively (Supplementary Table 4). The differences in antibody 
half-life may be due to the presence of the target antigen in the HIV-1-infected individuals 
and accelerated clearance of antigen-antibody immune complexes34–36,43. Moreover, HIV-1-
infection is associated with increased levels of immunoglobulins potentially resulting in 
reduced antibody half-lives44.
10-1074 reduces viremia in individuals with sensitive HIV-1 strains
As expected, no changes in viral load were detected after infusion in 3 ART suppressed 
individuals (VL < 20 copies/ml) (Table 1, Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Table 
Caskey et al.

 3a). At the time of enrollment, HIV-1-RNA levels in the 16 HIV-1-infected individuals who 
were not on ART ranged from 840 – 77,610 copies/ml (geometric mean of 12,851 copies/ml, 
Table 1, Supplementary Table 1, and Supplementary Table 3a). The 3 individuals that 
received a dose of 10 mg/kg of the antibody showed a rapid 1.08–1.56 log10 copies/ml 
decrease in viremia, with a nadir at 7 – 9 days (Fig. 2a, Supplementary Fig. 3a and 
Supplementary Table 3a) and a return of viral RNA copy number to baseline levels within 3 
to 4 weeks after infusion (Fig. 2a, Supplementary Fig. 3a and Supplementary Table 3a). Out 
of 13 viremic participants administered a dose of 30 mg/kg, 11 experienced a rapid decrease 
in their HIV-1-RNA levels. The 2 individuals that failed to respond, 1HD2 and 1HD9K, 
were infected with 10-1074-resistant HIV-1 variants before 10-1074 infusion (Fig. 2a and 
3b, Supplementary Fig. 4). The average drop in viremia in individuals that received 30 
mg/kg of 10-1074 and harbored sensitive strains was 1.52 log10 copies/ml (range 0.9 to 2.06 
log10 copies/ml). The nadir was reached after an average of 10.3 days (range 7–25). When 
compared to pre-treatment HIV-1-RNA levels (day 0), the decrease in viremia in this group 
was significant from about day 3 to day 27 post-infusion (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Table 
3a, Supplementary Figure 5). The average 10-1074 serum concentrations at viral rebound 
(defined as an increase of at least 0.5 log10 copies/ml above nadir and confirmed in the 
follow-up visit) were 23.7 and 76.9 μg/ml in the 10 and 30 mg/kg dose groups, respectively 
(Fig. 2b). The most sustained response, 58 days, occurred in individual 1HD6K, who 
exhibited a 10-1074 concentration of 6.5 μg/ml at rebound (Fig. 2b). Maximum drop in viral 
load (Δlog10 copies/ml) was not correlated with the 10-1074 neutralization sensitivity (IC80) 
of primary virus cultures obtained before infusion (Spearman’s rho: −0.05) or with baseline 
viremia (Spearman’s rho = −0.19) (Fig. 2c, d). Relative T cell subsets remained unchanged 
(Supplementary Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table 3a). We conclude that 10-1074 
administration rapidly decreases viremia in individuals infected with sensitive HIV-1 strains.
Viremia at rebound contains a mixture of different escape variants
To examine the precise nature of the virologic effects of 10-1074 infusion, we performed 
single genome sequencing (SGS) on circulating viruses from 15 out of 16 viremic 
individuals before and after infusion, retrieving a total of 1,111 full length envelope 
sequences (Supplementary Table 5). Study subjects were infected with epidemiologically 
distinct Clade B viruses (Fig. 3a, Supplementary Fig. 4). Consistent with different durations 
of HIV-1 infection, day 0 env diversity and phylogenetic complexity varied between 
participants (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 4).
The 10-1074 antibody makes critical contacts with Env glycans at a potential N-linked 
glycosylation site (PNGS) at position N332 and with the 324G(D/N)IR327 motif at the base 
of the V3 loop11,14,45. With the exception of the 2 individuals that were resistant to 10-1074 
(1HD2 and 1HD9K) and subject 1HC1, all day 0 plasma env sequences in the remaining 10 
individuals displayed a PNGS at position N332 and an intact 324G(D/N)IR327 motif, 
suggesting that the corresponding viruses are sensitive to 10-1074 (Fig. 3b, Supplementary 
Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table 5). Subject 1HC1, who responded to 10-1074 infusion with 
only a 1.0 log10 copies/ml drop in viremia, carried an N332T mutation in 2 of 19 viruses 
sequenced before infusion (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 4). The 2 individuals that did not 
respond carried single amino acid mutations at either the PNGS (N332T in 1HD2) or a

 10-1074 contact residue in the protein-binding motif (D325E in 1HD9K) in 100% of day 0 
plasma env sequences (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 4).
Four weeks after infusion, 370 intact envelope sequences were obtained from 13 subjects 
that responded to 10-1074. Over 91% of sequences showed recurrent amino acid (AA) 
mutations, most of which (97%) eliminated the PNGS at position 332 by mutating either 
N332 or S334 (Fig. 3c, d). 3% of mutated sequences showed changes at D/N325 in 
the 324G(D/N)IR327 motif (Fig. 3c,d, Supplementary Table 5). Viral sequences comprised a 
mixture of different variants, all of which were closely related to pre-infusion day 0 viruses, 
highlighting the multi-clonal origin of rebound viremia (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 4). 
Mutations at AA positions 325, 332 and 334 were mutually exclusive with only one of three 
positions being mutated in any given virus (Supplementary Fig. 4). Two of the most frequent 
mutations, S334N and N332S, were found in 12/13 (S334N) and 11/13 (N332S) of the 
individuals analyzed (Fig 3c, d and Supplementary Fig. 4).
On the nucleotide level, 99% (319 out of 322) of mutations affecting the PNGS at N332 
were due to a single change relative to day 0 (Supplementary Fig. 7). The majority of these 
mutations were transitions, consistent with reverse transcriptase (RT) errors46. Day 0 viruses 
from 10 out of 13 individuals that responded to 10-1074 infusion carried the triplets AAC-
ATT-AGT at positions 332–334 in 99% of their pre-infusion sequences (Supplementary Fig. 
7). Interestingly, these individuals exhibited a very similar spectrum of amino acid escape 
mutations at week 4 (Fig. 3d, Supplementary Fig. 7). In contrast, subject 1HD6K, who 
maintained viral suppression for over 8 weeks, exhibited a different set of codons, i.e., AAT-
ATT-TCT, in the antibody target region. This likely resulted in a different spectrum of 
escape mutations indicating that the codon composition in this region may influence viral 
escape from 10-1074 (Fig. 3d, Supplementary Fig. 7).
To determine whether loss of the PNGS at position N332 or 324G(D/N)IR327 mutation is 
associated with resistance to 10-1074, we performed neutralization assays on 114 
pseudoviruses expressing envelope proteins derived from circulating viruses on day 0 (55 
pseudoviruses) and 4 weeks (59 pseudoviruses) after 10-1074 infusion (Fig. 3e, 
Supplementary Figure 4, Supplementary Table 6). The pseudoviruses were tested against 
antibodies currently in, or being considered for, clinical testing. These include 3BNC117 
and VRC01 that target the CD4 binding site34–36,38; 10-1074 and PGT121 that recognize the 
base of the V3 loop and surrounding glycans11,12; and PGDM1400, which recognizes a 
conformational epitope at the top of the envelope spike16. PGT121 differs from 10-1074 in 
that it interacts more strongly with glycans at positions N137, N156, and N301, and as a 
result PGT121 is believed to be less dependent on the glycan at N332 than 10-107413,14.
As expected, there was no correlation between emergence of resistance to 10-1074 and 
resistance to antibodies targeting non-overlapping sites on HIV-1 Env (3BNC117, VRC01, 
or PGDM1400, Fig. 3e). Consistent with data obtained by examining large panels of HIV-1 
pseudoviruses, there was no significant difference in sensitivity against 10-1074 and 
PGT121 (MeanGEO IC80 = 0.10 vs. 0.08 μg/ml; p=0.19, respectively; Fig. 3e) and 3BNC117 
was generally more potent than VRC01 (MeanGEO IC80 = 0.37 vs. 1.18 μg/ml; p=5.1 × 
10−6; (Fig. 3e). In 10 out of 11 individuals from whom envelopes were tested, HIV-1 strains

 that developed resistance to 10-1074 were also resistant to PGT121 (Supplementary Table 
6). Thus, the interaction between PGT121 and additional glycans on the Env protein had 
little impact on the neutralizing potency of PGT121 on the naturally arising N332 
or 324G(D/N)IR327 viral variants tested.
We also analyzed changes in the composition of observed escape mutations in HIV-1 
variants in 6 individuals over time. In all 6 individuals, the relative abundance of escape 
variants changed over time (Fig. 4). In addition, in 5 out of 6 subjects, strains carrying the 
intact 324G(D/N)IR327 protein motif and a PNGS at N332 re-emerged at 12, 16 or 24 weeks 
after infusion at a time when 10-1074 levels approached or were below the limit of detection 
(Fig. 4). This indicates ongoing selection for both resistance and/or viral fitness after 
10-1074 infusion.
Escape variants are pre-existing or rapidly generated
Previous studies suggest that high viral turnover in HIV-1 infection results in a multitude of 
circulating mutant strains in any given individual47,48. To examine the dynamics of early 
viral escape, we sequenced viruses present in the plasma 1 week after 10-1074 
administration in 7 individuals (Supplementary Fig. 8 and Supplementary Table 5). We 
found a mixture of unmutated and N332-PNGS- or 324G(D/N)IR327-mutant viruses. 
Moreover, the frequency of escape variants at this early time point after infusion was 
inversely correlated with the duration of viral suppression; R2 = 0.73 (Supplementary Fig. 
8).
The kinetics of escape are consistent with pre-existing resistant viral variants in circulation 
at the time of infusion and/or rapid de novo generation of these mutations. To estimate the 
frequency of pre-existing variants and to assess how they contribute to 10-1074 escape, we 
performed primer-ID based deep-sequencing (PIDS) of the V3-loop region49,50 on 5 study 
participants. A total of 2,077 and 1,844 viral consensus sequences were obtained at day 0 
and week 4, respectively (Supplementary Table 7). The obtained sampling depth was 
powered to detect a mutation present in 1.0% (range: 0.5%–2.4%) of the viral population 
with 95% confidence. While mutations at positions 325, 332 or 334 were found in 99.8% of 
the sequences in the week 4 samples, none were observed at day 0 (Supplementary Table 7). 
This indicates that potential pre-existing escape mutations are likely less frequent than 1.0%.
We also performed full-length envelope deep-sequencing (SMRT [Single molecule real 
time] sequencing) of day 0 and week 4 samples from 3 of the same subjects (Fig. 5 and 
Supplementary Table 8)51. Frequencies of detected variants carrying a 325 or 332–334 
mutation agreed well among SMRT sequencing, PIDS, and SGS (Supplementary Table 8). A 
phylogenetic tree of SMRT sequences confirmed that escape variants arose from multiple 
independent HIV-1 viruses (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. 9). Out of a total of 30,711 day 0 
sequences obtained by SMRT sequencing, we found D/N325K and S334R mutations in 
subject 1HD1 at a rate of 0.15% and 0.11%, respectively, and the S334N mutation at a rate 
of 0.34% in subject 1HB3. No 325 or 332–334 mutants were detected in subject 1HC2 (Fig. 
5 and Supplementary Fig. 9). We conclude that circulating pre-existing variants carrying 
mutations at key positions associated with resistance to 10-1074 can be detected at very low

 frequency in individuals considered sensitive to the antibody and that resistance originates 
from multiple viral variants.
Discussion
Antibodies play a unique role in the therapeutic armamentarium against human cancers and 
inflammatory diseases because they engage the host immune system to attack tumor cells or 
modify inflammatory responses by binding to Fc receptors on host leukocytes. Similarly, in 
HIV-1-infected individuals, passively transferred antibodies accelerate the clearance of 
infected cells, and induce host immunity against HIV-130,32,33,37. These unique features of 
immunotherapy suggest that antibodies should be further explored as adjuncts to 
conventional ART for prevention or treatment of HIV-1 infection.
Anti-CD4 binding site antibodies 3BNC117 and VRC01 have been generally safe and 
effective in decreasing plasma HIV-1-RNA levels34,35, and preventing rebound viremia 
during analytical treatment interruption in humans38,52. The two antibodies differ in their 
relative potency and half-lives, with 3BNC117 having a somewhat longer half-life and 
greater potency34,35,38. As expected, these properties are reflected in the relative ability of 
the two antibodies to prevent infection in macaques, and to prolong viral suppression in 
humans undergoing analytical treatment interruption38,52. The finding that 10-1074 has 
favorable safety and pharmacokinetics profiles and is effective in decreasing viremia extends 
these observations to an additional non-overlapping target of vulnerability on the HIV-1 
spike.
10-1074 is more potent, and has a comparable half-life, but has a narrower spectrum of 
activity than either of the two CD4 binding site antibodies. Its effect on viremia is similar to 
3BNC117, but a higher frequency of fully resistant escape variants was detected for 10-1074 
compared to 3BNC11734,37,38. We speculate that this difference in occurrence of escape 
may be due to the relative cost of altering the CD4 binding site, making viable escape from 
antibodies that target this site more difficult as has been shown in vitro53. As a consequence, 
the number of distinct escape variants that can give rise to high-level viremia may be 
reduced. This idea is consistent with the relative paucity of naturally arising viruses that are 
resistant to 3BNC117 in comparison to 10-1074 or all other glycan patch bNAbs54. 
However, we did observe that 10-1074 escape mutations are selected against in several 
individuals when antibody levels drop. This finding suggests that these mutations are also 
associated with a fitness cost in vivo.
In humanized mice and in humans, a single antibody, like a single small molecule drug, is 
insufficient to prevent the emergence of resistant viral variants because the infection 
produces a swarm of related mutant viruses26,34,35,55. Similar to what has been described for 
small molecule drugs, resistance to antibodies seems to arise from pre-existing minority 
variants and/or de-novo mutations produced during rapid HIV-1 turnover. Our findings 
underscore some of the similarities in antiviral activity between small molecule drugs and 
antibodies, and emphasize that combinations of antibodies targeting non-overlapping 
epitopes will be required for effective therapy and possibly prevention.

 10-1074 targets an epitope that is distinct from other second-generation bNabs that have 
been tested in humans34,35. It has favorable clinical characteristics and potent anti-viral 
activity and therefore, 10-1074 is a promising candidate for antibody-mediated combination 
immunotherapy and prevention of HIV-1 infection.

Online Methods
10-1074 Study Drug
10-1074 is a recombinant, fully human IgG1λ mAb recognizing the base of the V3 loop and 
surrounding glycans on the HIV-1 envelope11. 10-1074 was cloned from an African donor 
(Patient 10)56 infected with an HIV-1 clade A virus11. It was expressed in Chinese hamster 
ovary cells (clone 3G4), and purified using standard methods. The 10-1074 drug substance 
was produced at Celldex Therapeutics’ Fall River (MA) GMP facility, and the drug product 
was fill-finished at Althea Technologies, Inc. (CA). The resulting purified 10-1074 was 
supplied as a single use sterile 20 mg/ml solution for intravenous injection in a 5.0 ml 
volume of buffered solution composed of sodium phosphate, potassium phosphate, 
potassium chloride, sodium chloride, and polysorbate 80 with a pH of 7.0. 10-1074 vials 
were shipped and stored at 4°C.
Study design
An open-label, dose-escalation phase 1 study (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02511990, EudraCT: 
2015-004574-15) was conducted in HIV-1-infected (Group 1) and uninfected subjects 
(Group 2) to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics and antiviral activity of 10-1074. Study 
participants were enrolled sequentially according to eligibility criteria. A standard “3+3” 
phase I trial design was used in the dose-escalation phase of the study. 10-1074 was 
administered as a single intravenous infusion over 60 minutes at three dose levels: 3mg/kg 
(subjects 1HA1–1HA3, 2HA1–2HA3), 10 mg/kg (subjects 1HB1–1HB3, 2HB1–2HB3), or 
30 mg/kg (subjects 1HC1- 1HC3, 1HD1, 1HD2, 1HD4K-1HD11K, 2HC1–2HC3, 2HD1–
2HD5). Study participants were followed for 84–168 days (24 weeks) after infusion. All 
participants provided written informed consent before participation in the study and the 
study was conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice. The protocol was approved 
by the Federal Drug Administration in the USA, the Paul-Ehrlich-Institut in Germany, and 
the Institutional Review Boards at the Rockefeller University and the University of Cologne.
Study Participants
All study participants were recruited at the Rockefeller University Hospital, New York, 
USA, at the University Hospital Cologne, Cologne, Germany, or at Montefiore Medical 
Center, New York, USA. Eligible subjects were adults aged 18 – 65 years, HIV-1-infected or 
uninfected, and without concomitant hepatitis B or C infections. HIV-1-infected subjects 
enrolled in study group 1A were on ART with plasma HIV-1 RNA levels < 20 copies/ml,

 and received a single 3 mg/kg 10-1074 infusion. In groups 1B through 1D, subjects were off 
ART (ART-experienced or ART-naïve) for at least 8 weeks before participation in the study 
and had plasma HIV-1 RNA levels < 100,000 copies/ml, measured on two separate 
occasions at least 1 week apart, and received a single 10 mg/kg (1B) or 30 mg/kg (1C-1D) 
10-1074 infusion. Baseline sensitivity of viruses from outgrowth cultures to 10-1074 was 
known for all subjects enrolled in groups 1A-D with the exception of 1HC2, 1HD2, and 
1HD10K. Subjects with CD4+ T-cell counts < 300 cells/μl, clinically relevant deviations 
from normal physical findings, and/or laboratory examinations were excluded. Screening 
period was from day -49 to day -7 prior to infusion, and the window for the pre-infusion 
visit was day -42 to day -1 prior to infusion. Race was recorded as self-reported. Women of 
childbearing age were required to have a negative serum pregnancy test on the day of 
10-1074 infusion. HIV-1-infected individuals, who were not on ART at enrollment, were 
encouraged to initiate ART 6 weeks after 10-1074 infusion.
Study Procedures
The appropriate volume of 10-1074 was calculated according to study dose group, diluted in 
sterile normal saline to a total volume of 100 or 250 ml, and administered intravenously over 
60 minutes. Study participants received 10-1074 on day 0 and remained under close 
monitoring in the infusion unit of the Rockefeller University Hospital or the University 
Hospital Cologne for 24 hours. Participants returned for frequent follow up visits for safety 
assessments that included physical examination and measurement of clinical laboratory 
parameters such as hematology, chemistries, urinalysis, coagulation times, pregnancy tests, 
as well as HIV-1 viral load and CD4+ and CD8+ T cell counts (Fig. 1a). Adverse events 
were graded according to the DAIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric 
Adverse Events (version 2.0, November 2014) (HIV-1-infected groups) or the Toxicity 
Grading Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine 
Clinical Trials (September 2007) (uninfected groups). Blood samples (30 to 120 ml) were 
collected before and at multiple times after 10-1074 infusion. Samples were processed 
within 4 h of collection, and serum and plasma samples were stored at −80°C. Peripheral 
blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated by density gradient centrifugation. The 
absolute number of PBMCs was determined by an automated cell counter (Vi-Cell XR; 
Beckman Coulter) or manually, and cells were cryopreserved in fetal bovine serum plus 10% 
DMSO.
Plasma HIV-1 RNA Levels
Plasma was collected for measuring HIV-1 RNA levels at screening (from d −49 to d −7), 
the pre-infusion visit (from d -42 to d -1), day 0 (before infusion), and on days 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 
21, 28, 42, 56, 84, 112, 140 and 168. HIV-1 RNA levels were determined using the Roche 
COBAS AmpliPrep/COBAS TaqMan HIV-1 Assay, Version 2.0, or the Roche Cobas 6800 
HIV-1 kit, which detect 20–10×106 copies/ml.
CD4+ and CD8+ T cells
CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell counts were determined at screening, on day 0 (before infusion), 
days 7, 14, 28, 56, 112, and 168 by a clinical flow cytometry assay, performed at LabCorp or 
at the University Hospital Cologne.

 Measurement of 10-1074 serum levels by TZM.bl
Blood samples were collected immediately before, at the end, 24 hours after completion of 
the 10-1074 infusion, and on days 2, 4, 7, 14, 21, 28, 42, 56, 84, 112, 140 and 168. Levels of 
active 10-1074 were determined by a TZM.bl neutralization assay34,40–42. Serum samples 
were heat-inactivated for 1h at 56°C and measured for neutralizing activity against an HIV-1 
strain that was highly sensitive to 10-1074 but resistant to autologous HIV-1 neutralizing 
serum activity. In non-infected subjects, serum samples were tested against Du422 (clade C, 
tier 2) and ID50 values were derived using 5-parameter curve fitting. The serum 
concentration of active 10-1074 was calculated by taking into account the sera ID50 titers 
multiplied by the known IC50 of 10-1074 for Du422. In HIV-1-infected subjects, pre-
infusion samples were first tested against a panel of 10-1074-sensitive HIV-1 strains. All 
subjects showed no or only minimal background activity to 3103.v3.C10 (clade ACD, tier 
2), so this strain was used in this study group. ID50 values were used to determine 10-1074 
serum concentration in the same way as described above. Murine leukemia virus (MuLV)-
pseudotyped viruses were used to detect unspecific serum activity and serum samples 
displaying unspecific activity were excluded from analyses (Supplementary Table 3). Serum 
samples from individuals on ART were tested for neutralizing activity against pseudoviruses 
produced using an ART-resistant backbone. Briefly, mutations associated with resistance to 
integrase inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (Q148H, and K101P 
and Y181C, respectively) were co-introduced into the SG3ΔEnv vector using site-directed 
mutagenesis. This triple mutant backbone vector was found to significantly reduce or 
eliminate ART-associated inhibition against a MuLV control when tested against a large 
panel of serum samples obtained from individuals on a variety of ART regimens (M.S.S., 
unpublished data). Testing of serum samples from study subjects on ART included an 
MuLV-pseudotyped triple mutant virus to detect any residual ART-associated inhibition in 
the assay.
Pharmacokinetic analysis
Pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated by performing a non-compartmental analysis 
(NCA) using WinNonlin 6.3.
Virus cultures from HIV-1-infected individuals
Autologous virus was grown from PBMCs of 179 HIV-1 infected individuals under a 
separate IRB-approved protocol, as previously described34,37. Individuals from whom virus 
was isolated were recruited in New York, USA, and Cologne, Germany, suggesting that the 
majority are infected with Clade B viruses. Culture supernatants were tested for 
neutralization by 10-1074 as previously described34,40–42.
Statistical analyses
Pseudovirus neutralization data of 10-1074 was downloaded from the CATNAP database39 
(Supplementary Fig. 1). A virus was considered neutralized by 10-1074, if the antibody 
reached an 80% inhibitory concentration (IC80) for a given virus within the range of up to 20 
μg/ml. Any virus for which 10-1074 did not reach an IC80 within this concentration was 
considered not neutralized. Differences in serum half-life of 10-1074 between HIV-1-

 infected and uninfected individuals (Fig. 1) were compared by an unpaired two-tailed 
Student’s t-test with equal variances using GraphPad Prism. The sample size to detect > 0.6 
log10 decline in viremia with 80% power at significance level α of 0.05 was determined to 
be 10 HIV-1-infected individuals, not on ART, infected with 10-1074-sensitive viruses 
assuming that the standard deviation would be similar to 10-1074 effects in humanized 
mice27. Curves illustrating average change in viremia after 10-1074 infusions were fitted by 
robust lowess regression with 40% of the data using MATLAB_R2016a (Fig. 2a). The 
significance of the effect of 10-1074 on viral load was assessed by computing simultaneous 
confidence bands, and noting when the simultaneous confidence band did exclude a viral 
load difference of zero (Supplementary Fig. 5). Simultaneous confidence bands were 
computed with the R package locfit (version 1.5–9.1) for each patient subgroup using the 
Gaussian family for the local likelihood function (Supplementary Fig. 5). Nonparametric 
Spearman coefficients were calculated to assess the correlation between maximum drop in 
viremia after 10-1074 infusion and baseline sensitivity of autologous viruses to 10-1074 or 
baseline HIV-1 viral load (Fig. 2c, d). CD4+ and CD8+ T cell counts before and after 
10-1074 infusion were compared, respectively, by repeated measures one-way ANOVA and 
post-hoc Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test using GraphPad Prism (Supplementary Fig. 
6). The neutralization potency of different antibodies against patient-derived pseudoviruses 
(10-1074 vs. PGT121, 3BNC117 vs. VRC01) was compared using a model built on 
generalized estimating equations (Figure 3e)57. Comparisons were drawn on the basis of all 
day 0 pseudoviruses (n=55). The model was built with intercept and bNAb group as the only 
covariate. Measurements within a cluster (patient) were assumed to be equicorrelated and 
normal distribution was used. p-values were estimated for the null-hypothesis that the weight 
parameter of the group covariate is zero. GEEQBOX version 1.0 was used for calculations57.
Single genome sequencing (SGS) of viral env genes
Single genome amplification and sequencing of HIV-1 env genes was performed as 
described previously37,58. Sequences containing premature stopcodons or large internal 
deletions that would compromise env functionality were excluded from downstream 
analyses. Sequences were aligned using CLUSTALW version 259 and regions that could not 
be unambiguously aligned were removed from subsequent phylogenetic relationships. 
Phylograms were constructed using PhyML version 3.160 using evolutionary models favored 
by AICc with jModelTest version 2.1.461 or, for the large dataset in Fig. 3A, RAxML using 
a GTRGAMMA model62. To delineate 10-1074 escape mutations, SGS was performed on 
day 0 and week 4 plasma samples of 13/14 viremic individuals that responded to the 
antibody. Plasma samples from non-responders 1HD2 and 1HD9K were sequenced on day 0 
to determine resistance mutations. Week 1 sequencing was only performed on samples with 
higher viral loads for which sufficient plasma was available. Follow-up sequencing (week 
12, week 16, week 20, week 24) was performed on samples from subjects that remained off-
ART for more than 12 weeks post-infusion and for which sufficient plasma material was 
available.
Pseudovirus neutralization assays
CMV promoter-based pseudoviruses were generated as previously described63. Pseudovirus 
supernatants were tested for neutralization by 10-1074, PGT121, 3BNC117, VRC01, and

 PGDM1400 in a TZM.bl assay as previously described34,40–42. Neutralization testing was 
performed up to 50 μg/ml.
Primer ID-based deep-sequencing of the V3 loop
A Primer-ID deep-sequencing protocol of a ~500 bp region encompassing the base of the V3 
loop (HxB2 positions 6854 – 7356) of HIV-1 env was designed based on two recently 
published protocols49,50. Five subjects were chosen for analysis based on higher viral load 
and different times of rebound. Primers were designed to bind all 5 subjects’ env based on 
previously obtained SGS sequences. All primers were ordered from IDT using standard 
desalting as purification and the cDNA-primer was ordered using hand-mixing of all 10 
random nucleotides. RNA was extracted from plasma using the Qiagen MinElute Virus Spin 
Kit. cDNA synthesis was performed using Superscript III and primer 5′-
GTGACTGGAGTTCAGACGTGTGCTCTTCCGATCTNNNNN-
NNNNNCAGTTTTACAGTAGAAAAATTCCCCTCCACA-3′. cDNA was purified using 
Agencourt SPRIselect beads with a bead to reaction ratio of 0.6. All purified cDNA was 
amplified using primers V3-Forward 
5′GCCTCCCTCGCGCCATCAGAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGNNNNTGAGCCAATTCC
CATA-CATTATTGTGC and ADPT_2a 5′-GTGACTGGAGTTCAGACGTGTGCTC-3′. 
PCR was performed using Phusion Polymerase and a cycling protocol of initial denaturation 
at 98°C for 30 s, 25 cycles of 98°C for 10 s and 72°C for 1 min, and then a final extension at 
72°C for 5 min. First-round PCR products were again purified using Agencourt SPRIselect 
and eluted in a 50 μl volume. 2 μl of the first-round PCR product was then used in a second 
PCR using primers Universal Adapter 5′-
AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACACGCCTCCCTCGCGCCATCAGAGATGTG-
3′ and and Indexed adapter 5′-CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGATNNNNNNGTG-
ACTGGAGTTCAGACGTGTGCTC-3′ that carried a six-nucleotide fixed barcode that 
allowed for the identification of specific samples. Second-round PCR was performed using 
KAPA HiFi Polymerase 2× Ready Mix and cycling conditions of initial denaturation at 95°C 
for 2 min, followed by 25 cycles of 98°C 20s, 63°C 15s, 72°C 30s, and final elongation of 3 
min at 72°C. Second-round PCR product was again purified with Agencourt SPRIselect 
beads, visualized on a 2% agarose gel, and gel purified using the Macherey-Nagel Gel and 
PCR Purification Kit. Final products were analyzed using an Agilent Tapestation and Qubit 
fluorophotomer. Final products were multiplexed and sequenced paired-end on Illumina 
MiSeq using 2× 300 bp v3 chemistry. Reads were trimmed using trimfq from seqtk toolkit 
with error rate threshold of 1% (−q 0.01) and sequences shorter than 200nt were removed. 
Primer IDs were defined as the first 10nt at the 5′ of each read containing the 5′ cDNA 
primer. SMALT aligner (v. 0.76) was used to align the primer sequence with up 3 
mismatches or one gap. Primer IDs containing 10 or more sequences were assembled using 
MIRA (v. 4.0.2) to yield consensus sequences. Consensus sequences containing ambiguity 
codes were removed for the final analysis. Cross-contamination between subjects was 
checked by phylogenetic analysis and contaminants were discarded from the analysis. The 
limit-of-detection of the Primer-ID protocol was estimated for each sequenced patient 
separately using a power calculation as described previously64. MATLAB R2016a was used 
for power calculations using the sampsizepwr function with the binomial distribution option.

 Single molecule real time sequencing (SMRT sequencing) on Pacific Biosciences RS II
Three subjects were selected for SMRT sequencing analysis based on time of rebound, high 
viral load, and sample availability. Full-length HIV-1 env was amplified and sequenced on 
the Pacific Biosciences RS-II as described previously with two minor modifications51. First, 
primers were designed specifically for sequenced subjects using available SGS sequences 
that spanned the primer regions. Primers used for amplification were 5′-
GAGCAGARGACAGTGGCAATGA-3′ and 5′-
GGAGAATAGCTCTACGAGCTCTTTG-3′ for 1HB3, 
5′GAGCAGAAGACAGTGGCAATGA-3′51 and 
5′TGACCATTTATTGCCCATCTTATAGC-3′ for 1HC2 and 5′-
GAGCAGAAGACAGTGGCAATGA-3′51 and 5′-
CCACTTGCCACCCATTTTATAGGA-3′ for 1HD1. Second, the more recent PacBio P6-C4 
chemistry was used. Data was pre-processed using the PacBio CCS2 algorithm, generating 
single molecule circular consensus sequences. The Full-Length Envelope Analysis (FLEA) 
pipeline51 was used for further processing and visualization. MAFFT65 with manual 
curation was used to align amino acid sequences, and fastree266 was used to infer maximum 
likelihood phylogenies.

individuals
(a) Schematic representation of the study design. (b) Serum levels of 10-1074 as determined 
by TZM.bl assay. Mean values for each dose group with SEM for uninfected (left) and 
HIV-1-infected individuals (right). Dotted grey lines at the bottom indicate lower limit of 
detection of the assays when performed with HIV-1 strains Du422.1 (top, 1.59 μg/ml), 
3103.v3.c10 (middle, 0.43 μg/ml), and 3103.v3.c10 in an antiretroviral therapy-resistant 
backbone (bottom 0.26 μg/ml). Each sample was measured in duplicate. Serum half-life of 
10-1074 between HIV-1-uninfected and -infected individuals was significantly different 
(p<0.0001). Samples demonstrating nonspecific activity were excluded from the analysis 
(Supplementary Table 3).

 Figure 2. Viral load dynamics after 10-1074 infusion in HIV-1-infected participants
(a) 10-1074 dose of either 10 or 30 mg/kg is indicated on the left. Left graphs show absolute 
viral loads in HIV-1 RNA copies/ml (y-axis) vs. time in days after infusion (x-axis). Middle 
graphs demonstrate log10 changes in HIV-1 RNA levels from day 0. Right graphs show 
average log10 change in viremia after 10-1074 (red line) or 3BNC117 infusion34 (dotted 
black; curves were fitted by robust lowess regression with 40% of the data using 
MATLAB_R2016a). At the 30 mg/kg dose level, viremia was significantly suppressed from 
about day 3 to day 27 post infusion compared to viral load at day 0. The window of 
significant viral suppression was assessed by computing simultaneous confidence bands and 
determined when these excluded zero (Supplementary Figure 5). Stars indicate initiation of 
antiretroviral therapy. (b) Plot shows 10-1074 serum levels at the time of rebound for 
individuals receiving 10 or 30 mg/kg of 10-1074 (black or red circles, respectively). Dotted 
lines indicate mean time to rebound after 10-1074 infusion (black, 10 mg/kg, and red, 30 
mg/kg). (c) Maximum log10 decline in viremia as measured by RNA copies/ml vs. 10-1074
