 Homeopathy Use by US Adults: Results of
a National Survey
Michelle L. Dossett, MD, PhD, MPH, Roger B. Davis, ScD, Ted J. Kaptchuk, and Gloria Y. Yeh, MD, MPH
We used the 2012 National Health Interview Survey to compare homeopathy
users with supplement users and those using other forms of complementary and
integrative medicine. Among US adults, 2.1% used homeopathy within the past 12
months. Respiratory and otorhinolaryngology complaints were most commonly
treated (18.5%). Homeopathy users were more likely to use multiple comple-
mentary and integrative medicine therapies and to perceive the therapy as helpful
than were supplement users. US homeopathy use remains uncommon; however,
users perceive it as helpful. (Am J Public Health. 2016;106:743–745. doi:10.2105/

omeopathy is a system of complemen-
tary and integrative medicine (CIM)
with a resurgence of public interest in recent
decades.1,2 In the United States, many ho-
meopathic medicines may be purchased over
the counter. Although they are often sold
next to dietary supplements, the Food and
Drug Administration regulates them differ-
ently.3 Federal agencies are interested in
understanding public use and perceptions of
homeopathic products,4,5 but there is little
published information on this topic.6 Recent
reports suggest potential public health benefits
such as reductions in unnecessary antibiotic
use,7 reductions in costs to treat certain re-
spiratory diseases,8 improvements in peri-
menopausal depression,9 improved health
outcomes in chronically ill individuals,10 and
control of a Leptospirosis epidemic in Cuba.11
We analyzed data from the 2012 National
Health Interview Survey (NHIS) for preva-
lence and patterns of homeopathy use among
US adults in relation to other CIM use.
METHODS
NHIS gathers health-related data on the
civilian, noninstitutionalized US population
and is used to inform health policy. The most
recent survey that had questions about CIM
use occurred in 2012 and included 34 525
adults, with a conditional response rate of
79.7%.12
We included all adult respondents and
divided them into 4 mutually exclusive cat-
egories: individuals who used homeopathy
within the past 12 months (homeopathy use),
individuals who used herbs and dietary sup-
plements without homeopathy within the
past 12 months (supplements without ho-
meopathy), individuals who used neither
homeopathynordietary supplementsbutused
another form of CIM within a 12-month
period (other CIM use), and individuals who
did not use any form of CIM (no CIM use).
For some analyses, we further subdivided the
group that used homeopathy into those who
did or did not see a practitioner in association
with their homeopathy use.
We used survey procedures in SAS version
9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) and the sampling
weights provided12 to account for the survey’s
complex sampling design and to obtain statis-
tically accurate estimates for the civilian, non-
institutionalized US population. Additional
analytic details are presented as supplementary
methods(availableasasupplementtotheonline
version of this article at http://www.ajph.org).
RESULTS
The sociodemographic characteristics
and health behaviors of survey respondents
are presented in Table A, available as
a supplement to the online version of this
article at http://www.ajph.org. There were
significant differences among the 4 groups
for all factors examined. When we excluded
non-CIM users, there were no significant
differences among the 3 groups of CIM users
comparing percentage Hispanic ethnicity,
family income, alcohol use, and physical
activity. Homeopathy users were more
likely than were other CIM users to be
women, to be in the aged 30 to 44 years
bracket, to be White, to live in the west, to
be married, to be highly educated, and to
have a lower body mass index. Homeopathy
users were significantly more likely than
were supplement and other CIM users to use
nearly every category of CIM assessed on the
survey except for chiropractic or osteopathic
manipulation (Table 1). Homeopathy users
used significantly more total CIM modalities
than did supplement users or other CIM
users (Figure A, available as a supplement to
the online version of this article at http://
www.ajph.org).
Of the 718 homeopathy users surveyed,
only 140 (19%) saw a practitioner for ho-
meopathic therapy (data not shown). Two
thirds of homeopathy users ranked this mo-
dality withintheirtop 3 CIM therapies (69%of
those who saw a practitioner; 68% of those
who did not). A third of individuals (35% vs
33%,respectively) used this modality toaddress
a specific health-related condition. Similarly,

 a third of supplement users (32%) used sup-
plements to target health-related conditions.
Table 1 summarizes the most common health
conditions addressed by each group of CIM
users. The single most common condition
homeopathy users addressed was head and
chest colds.
Homeopathy users who saw a practitioner
were significantly more likely to feel that
homeopathy was “very important in main-
taining health and well-being” and that it
helped their health condition “a great deal”
than were homeopathy users who did not see
a practitioner (Figure B, available as a sup-
plement to the online version of this article
at http://www.ajph.org). Homeopathy
users who did not see a practitioner were
significantly more likely than were supple-
ment users to find the modality they used
helpful.
DISCUSSION
The 2002 and 2007 NHIS demonstrated
annual prevalence rates of homeopathy use
among US adults at 1.7% and 1.8%, re-
spectively.13 We found that, by 2012, use
had increased by approximately 15% to 2.1%
of US adults, likely a reflection of the
general increase in the prevalence of CIM
use around the country. Nonetheless, these
numbers are lower than are prevalence
rates of use from other Western countries,
such as Italy (8.2%) and Germany (14.8%).14
Sociodemographic factors previously shown
to be associated with CIM use such as
gender, education, income, and the pres-
ence of medical comorbidities13,14 were
significantly associated with CIM use in
our analysis as well.
In response to federal queries regarding
public use and perceptions of homeopathy,
the majority of users do not see a practitioner
for homeopathic therapy (81%) and pre-
sumably self-prescribe combination or in-
dividual products that are widely available
over the counter for specific self-limited
conditions. The most common conditions
treated were respiratory and otorhinolar-
yngology complaints (cold symptoms were
the most common; there is some evidence of
efficacy8,15,16) and musculoskeletal com-
plaints such as pain. Data from a small sample
of physicians who prescribe homeopathic
medicines suggest that treatment of re-
spiratory and otorhinolaryngology condi-
tions and musculoskeletal complaints is
common in clinical practice as well.6 In
general, homeopathy users perceive these
products to be more helpful for their health
than supplement users perceive their use of
supplements.
The dramatic difference in perceived
helpfulness between those who use
practitioner-prescribed homeopathy versus
those who self-prescribe homeopathy is in-
triguing. This difference may be the result of
an enhanced therapeutic effect stemming
from the nature of the patient–provider
relationship,17–19 a more individualized and
effective homeopathic prescription by the
provider,1,20 or intrinsic differences between
these 2 types of homeopathy users. The
last possibility we could not examine in
this study because of the small sample
size of homeopathy users who saw
practitioners.
Limitations
The major limitations of our study are the
potential for misclassification and recall bias,
because NHIS data rely on self-report.
Nonetheless, the NHIS is a carefully designed

 face-to-face survey and the best available
source for these kinds of health-related data
on the US population.
In addition, because of how the survey was
designed, we were unable to assess perceived
helpfulness of homeopathy use from all ho-
meopathy users. Modification of the survey to
acquire data on perceived helpfulness from all
CIM users would be informative. Also, the
relatively small number of users who see
practitioners for homeopathic treatment pre-
cluded any further analysis of this population.
We did not calculate out-of-pocket expendi-
tures for homeopathic medicines or practitioner
visitsbecauseofthelargeamountofmissingdata
and likely unreliability of such estimates.
Public Health Implications
Homeopathy users constitute a segment of
high CIM users and report high levels of
perceived helpfulness for this modality, par-
ticularly when they see a practitioner for
therapy. However, most homeopathy users do
not see practitioners and they self-prescribe,
predominantly for self-limited conditions.
Because of potential public health benefits7–11
associated with the use of homeopathy, further
research on this modalityand targeted studies of
users are warranted.
