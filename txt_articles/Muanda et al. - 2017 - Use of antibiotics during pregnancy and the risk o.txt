AIMS
Few studies have investigated the link between individual antibiotics and major congenital malformations (MCMs) including
specific malformations owing to small sample size. We aimed to quantify the association between exposure to gestational
antibiotic and the risk of MCMs.
METHODS
Using the Quebec pregnancy cohort (1998–2008), we included a total of 139 938 liveborn singleton alive whose mothers were
covered by the “Régie de l’assurance maladie du Québec” drug plan for at least 12 months before and during pregnancy.
Antibiotic exposure was assessed in the first trimester and MCMs were identified within the first year of life.
RESULTS
After adjusting for potential confounders, clindamycin exposure was associated with an increased risk of MCMs (aOR 1.34, 95%
CI 1.02–1.77, 60 exposed cases), musculoskeletal system malformations (aOR 1.67, 95% CI 1.12–2.48, 29 exposed cases) and
ventricular/atrial septal defect (aOR 1.81, 95% CI 1.04–3.16, 13 exposed cases). Doxycycline exposure increased the risk of cir-
culatory system malformation, cardiac malformations and ventricular/atrial septal defect (aOR 2.38, 95% CI 1.21–4.67, 9 ex-
posed cases; aOR 2.46, 95% CI 1.21–4.99, 8 exposed cases; aOR 3.19, 95% CI 1.57–6.48, 8 exposed cases, respectively).
Additional associations were seen with quinolone (1 defect), moxifloxacin (1 defect), ofloxacin (1 defect), macrolide (1 defect),
erythromycin (1 defect) and phenoxymethylpenicillin (1 defect). No link was observed with amoxicillin, cephalosporins and
nitrofurantoin. Similar results were found when penicillins were used as the comparator group.
CONCLUSIONS
Clindamycin, doxycycline, quinolones, macrolides and phenoxymethylpenicillin in utero exposure were linked to organ-specific
malformations. Amoxicillin, cephalosporins and nitrofurantoin were not associated with MCMs.

 WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ABOUT THIS SUBJECT
• Several studies have looked at the risk of major birth defect associated with the use of many antibiotics classes
(macrolides, quinolones, etc.) during pregnancy.
• Findings from many of them should be interpreted with caution due to methodological flaws including small sample
sizes, recall or indication bias.
• Few studies have investigated the link between individual antibiotics and major congenital malformations (MCMs) in-
cluding specific malformations.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS
• Clindamycin, doxycycline, quinolones, macrolides and phenoxymethylpenicillin in utero exposure were linked to an
increased risk of some organ-specific malformations.
• Amoxicillin, cephalosporins and nitrofurantoin were not associated with major or specific birth defects.
• Though the absolute risks for specific birth defects was small, physicians should consider prescribing safer antibiotics for
the treatment of maternal infections when possible until more data are available.
Introduction
Antibiotics are widely used during pregnancy worldwide to
treat common infections including urinary and respiratory
tract infections. In the United States, nitrofurantoin and
metronidazole are the most prescribed medication dispensed
among pregnant women enrolled in the US Medicaid Pro-
gram [1]. In Quebec province, it has been reported that there
is an increasing trend for macrolides, quinolones, tetracy-
cline and nitrofurantoin use during pregnancy [2]. In animal
studies, current evidence suggests a link between quinolone
use during pregnancy and cartilage damage [3]. Association
between tetracyclines use and fetal tooth discoloration and
bone growth inhibition was also observed [4]. Furthermore,
animal studies have shown that clarithromycin could in-
duce fetal loss in rabbits and monkeys when used in very
low dosages and high dosages, respectively [5]. Conversely,
several reproduction studies have been performed in rabbits
and rats at doses up to six times the human dose and have
revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus exposed to
nitrofurantoin [6]. Neither embryotoxic nor teratogenic
effects were seen following metronidazole exposure in mice
and rats despite the fact that some fetal deaths were noted
after intraperitoneal administration in mice [7]. Findings
from animal studies cannot be extrapolated in human for
several reasons including metabolism differences between
humans and other species [8–10].
Although, several human studies have been conducted to
evaluate the risk of major congenital malformations (MCMs),
evidence regarding fetal safety of these antibiotics remains
inconclusive. Nine studies failed to show an association be-
tween macrolide exposure during pregnancy and the risk of
MCMs or cardiac malformations [5, 11–18]. However, two
studies showed an increased risk of cardiac defects associated
with erythromycin use [19, 20]. Eight studies did not find an
association of MCMs with quinolone use [17, 21–27]. Four
studies reported an increased risk of MCMs associated with
tetracyline use specifically for cardiac malformations and
oral clefts [28–31]. However, one study failed to show an as-
sociation between tetracycline use and MCMs [17]. A meta-
analysis based on three cohort studies did not show an
increased risk of MCMs associated with nitrofurantoin use
but when restricted to three case control studies an in-
creased risk of MCMs has been found [32]. Recently another
study has reported that nitrofurantoin exposure was associ-
ated with an increased risk of oral clefts [33]. A systematic
review based on 13 studies failed to show an association be-
tween metronidazole use and the risk of MCMs [34]. Find-
ings from many of these studies should be interpreted
with caution due to methodological flaws including small
sample sizes, recall or indication bias. To our knowledge,
the risk of organ-specific malformations associated with in-
dividual antibiotics such as clindamycin has not yet been
investigated. Therefore our study aimed to quantify the as-
sociation between gestational exposure to antibiotic classes
and types and the risk of MCMs including organ-specific
malformations.
Material and methods
Setting
We carried out a population-based cohort study using data
from the Quebec pregnancy cohort (QPC). The QPC has been
described previously in Bérard and Sheehy’s article [35].
Briefly, it is an ongoing population-based cohort with pro-
spective data collection on all pregnancies of women covered
by the Quebec Public Prescription Drug Insurance, from
January 1998 to December 2009, in the province of Quebec.
Information
for
each
pregnancy
is
obtained
from
province-wide databases and linked using unique personal
identifiers. All pregnancies included in the QPC were identi-
fied in the “Régie de l’Assurance Maladie du Québec” (RAMQ)
and the Quebec hospitalization archives (MedEcho) data-
bases. The first day of the last menstrual period (defined as
the first day of gestation, 1DG) was determined using data
on gestational age (GA), which was validated by patient
charts and ultrasound measures [36]. Prospective follow-up
data were available from 1 year before the 1DG, during preg-
nancy and until December 2009.
The data sources for this study included the medical
service database (RAMQ: diagnoses, medical procedures,
socio-economic
status
of
women
and
prescribers),
the
Quebec Public Prescription Drug Insurance database (drug
name, start date, dosage and duration), the hospitalization
archive database (Med Echo: in-hospital diagnoses and
F. T. Muanda et al.

Br J Clin Pharmacol (2017) 83 2557–2571
 procedures, and GA), and the Quebec Statistics database (ISQ:
patient socio-demographic and birth weight).
Study cohort
Pregnancies from the QPC meeting the following inclusion
criteria were included in our cohort.
1. Pregnancies ending with a live-born singleton. Pregnan-
cies with multiplicity were excluded as it is a known risk
factor for MCMs.
2. Pregnancies with a continuous prescription drug insur-
ance coverage of ≥12 months before the 1DG, during preg-
nancy and with at least 12 months of follow-up after birth.
This avoided a misclassification of MCMs that cannot be
diagnosed at birth.
Pregnancies with exposure to known teratogens [37, 38]
during the first trimester, chromosomal aberrations and mi-
nor malformations were also excluded.
Given that we aimed to compare pregnancies exposed
to only one class of antibiotics with unexposed pregnan-
cies, during the first trimester, those exposed to multiple
antibiotics or exposed to other anti-infective drugs were ex-
cluded as well. The study was approved by the Quebec Data
Access Agency and the CHU Sainte-Justine Institutional Re-
view Board.
Antibiotics exposure
We defined exposure to antibiotics as either having filled at
least one prescription for any type of antibiotics within the
first trimester of pregnancy or as having filled a prescription
for an antibiotic before pregnancy but with a duration that
overlapped the 1DG. Only exposure during the first trimester
was considered of interest given that organogenesis occurs
during that period.
The following classes of antibiotics, defined according to
the American Hospital Formulary Service (AHFS) categories,
were considered: cephalosporins (AHFS 8:12:06), macrolides
(AHFS 8:12:12), penicillins (AHFS 8:12:16), sulfonamides
(AHFS 8:12:20), urinary anti-infectives (AHFS 8:36), other an-
tibacterials (AHFS 8:12:28), tetracyclines (AHFS 8:12.24);
quinolones
(AHFS
8:12.18)
and
antiprotozoals
(AHFS
8:30.92).
The following individual antibiotics were also taken into
account:
amoxicillin,
amoxicillin/potassium
clavulanate,
phenoxymethylpenicillin,
cephalexin,
azithromycin,
clarithromycin,
ciprofloxacin,
norfloxacin,
levofloxacin,
ofloxacin, clindamycin, doxycycline, minocycline, erythro-
mycin, metronidazole, nitrofurantoin and sulfamethoxazole
trimethoprim.
We defined a non-exposure category as pregnancies with
no exposure to antibiotic during the time window of interest.
Filled prescription of antibiotics within the QPC has been
validated against maternal reports with high positive and
negative predictive value (PPV 86.7% and NPV 92.3%) [39].
Major congenital malformations
MCMs diagnosed in the first year of life were identified in the
RAMQ medical file and MedEcho databases and defined ac-
cording to International Classification of Diseases ICD-9
and ICD-10 codes (see Table S1 in the supplementary
appendix).
We investigated eight specific organ system MCMs in-
cluding MCMs for which association with some antibiotic
have not yet been studied (see Table S1 in the supplementary
appendix). We also assessed four specific defects including
cardiac malformations.
MCMs included in the QPC have also been validated
against medical charts with high PPV (78.1%) and NPV
(94.2%) [40]. High PPV (over 80%) have also been reported
for specific MCMs including cardiac, cleft, digestive and uri-
nary MCMs [40]. All organ systems were considered and de-
fined according to the European Registration of Congenital
Anomalies and Twins (EUROCAT) Registry [41].
Chromosomal abnormalities are likely unrelated to expo-
sure. Moreover, diagnosis of a minor malformation among
physicians is likely to be subjective. Given that, those
malformations were not considered in our study, to avoid
MCM misclassification.
Covariates
We selected a priori variables associated with both antibi-
otics exposure and MCMs as potential confounders and risk
factors for MCMs (Table 1 and Table S2). The following
covariates were included: (1) Socio-demographic variables
including maternal age on the 1DG, maternal marital status
(living alone or cohabiting), receipt of social assistance dur-
ing pregnancy, education level in years (≤12 or >12), and
area of residence on the 1DG (urban or rural). (2) Maternal
chronic co-morbidities according to physician-based diag-
noses or filled prescriptions of related medications in the
year before and during the first trimester of pregnancy
(chronic
hypertension,
depression,
diabetes
mellitus,
asthma, epilepsy, polyarthritis rheumatoid and systemic lu-
pus erythematosus, and thyroid disorders. (3) Endometri-
osis
and
maternal
infections
(urinary
tract
infection,
respiratory tract infection, bacterial vaginosis, and sexually
transmitted diseases) determined with physician-based di-
agnoses in the year before and during the first trimester of
pregnancy. Details on the codes used have been provided
in the supplemental files (Table S2). A direct acyclic graph
was used to illustrate the structure of confounding with
maternal
infections
[42]
(Table
S3).

Statistical analysis
Descriptive analyses were performed to summarize the
study population characteristics, using one-way analysis of
variance (ANOVA) and chi-square tests for continuous
and categorical variables, respectively. Within our study
cohort, we conducted separate analyses for overall major
congenital
malformations,
and
for
each
organ
system
malformation.
Given that a women could be pregnant several times dur-
ing the study period and meet the inclusion criteria, we used a
conditional generalized estimation equation (GEE) to ac-
count for the within-subject correlation. Thus, pregnancy
was the unit of analysis.

 We calculated prevalence odds ratios (ORs) and 95% con-
fidence intervals (CIs) after controlling for the potential con-
founders listed above.
In a sensitivity analysis, penicillin exposure was used as
reference group given its indications shared with other anti-
biotics during pregnancy [43, 44].
Results
After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, the study
population included 139 938 live births (Figure 1). Of this
cohort, 15 469 pregnancies were exposed to antibiotics

Other antibacterials exposure during the first trimester of
pregnancy was associated with an increased risk of MCMs
(aOR 1.34, 95% CI 1.01–1.76, 60 exposed cases). The most
common
antibiotics
classes
(penicillins,
macrolides,
cephalosporines, quinolones and urinary anti-infectives)
did not increase the risk of MCMs.
Other antibacterials exposure was associated with an in-
creased risk of musculoskeletal system malformation (aOR

exposed
cases)
and
ventricular/atrial septal defect (aOR 1.81, 95% CI 1.04–3.14,
13 exposed cases).
Macrolides exposure was associated with an increased risk
of digestive system malformations (aOR 1.46, 95% CI
1.04–2.06, 35 exposed cases) and quinolone exposure in-
creased the risk of urinary system malformations (aOR 1.89,
95% CI 1.09–3.28, 14 exposed cases).

Phenoxymethylpenicillin exposure was associated with an
increased risk of nervous system malformations (aOR 1.85,
95% CI 1.01–3.39, 11 exposed cases). Erythromycin expo-
sure increased the risk of urinary system malformations
(aOR
2.12,
95%

1.08–4.17,
9
exposed
cases).
Moxifloxacin exposure was associated with an increased risk
of respiratory system malformations (aOR 5.48, 95% CI
1.32–22.76, 2 exposed cases).
Doxycycline exposure was associated with an increased
risk
of
circulatory
system
malformation,
cardiac
malformations and ventricular/atrial septal defect, respec-
tively (aOR 2.38, 95% CI 1.21–4.67, 9 exposed cases; aOR
2.46, 95% CI 1.21–4.99, 8 exposed cases; aOR 3.19, 95% CI
1.57–6.48, 8 exposed cases). Clindamycin exposure in-
creased the risk of musculoskeletal system malformation
(aOR 1.67, 95% CI 1.12–2.48, 29 exposed cases) and
ventricular/atrial
septal
defect
(aOR
1.81,
95%
CI
1.04–3.16, 13 exposed cases). Amoxicillin, nitrofurantoin,
cephalexin and metronidazole did not increase the risk of
MCMs or organ-specific MCMs.
In sensitivity analyses, when penicillin exposure was used
as comparator group, similar estimates were found but with
less precision (Tables S4–S6).
Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the largest cohort study investigat-
ing the risk of MCMs including organ-specific malformations
associated with the use of antibiotics classes and types during
pregnancy. Penicillin and most specifically amoxicillin were
not associated with an increased risk of MCMs and organ-
specific MCMs. These findings are consistent with the current
literature [45, 46].
Similar to the study results of Denker et al. [47],
phenoxymethylpenicillin exposure was not associated with
MCMs nor cardiac malformations. However, we found an
85% increased risk of nervous system malformations follow-
ing in utero exposure to phenoxymethylpenicillin during the
first trimester of pregnancy, though residual confounding or
chance finding could not be ruled out. This finding requires
further investigation.
Macrolides exposure was not associated with an in-
creased risk of MCMs nor cardiac malformations as previ-
ously reported in other studies [5, 11–18]. However we
found
a
46%
increased
risk
of
digestive
system
malformations. There is currently a debate on a possible as-
sociation between macrolide use and infantile pyloric ste-
nosis
[48,
49].
Though
evidence
suggested
that
late
pregnancy and early infancy were the time windows of in-
terest for this malformation, little attention has been paid
to the first trimester of pregnancy despite the fact that or-
ganogenesis occurs during that period. Therefore, our re-
sults should be considered as exploratory and require
further research on specific digestive malformations such
as orofacial cleft. Erythromycin use was associated with
an increased risk of major urinary system malformations.
However, chance finding or residual confounding could
also be an explanation for this finding. Compared to peni-
cillin, no association was found due to a lack of power.
Similarly to previous studies [17, 21–27], quinolones use
was not associated with an increased risk of MCMs. However,
we
found
a
89%
increased
risk
of
urinary
system
malformations associated with quinolone exposure. Com-
pared to penicillins use, quinolone exposure still tended to
increase the risk of urinary system malformations though it
did not reach statistical significance.
Moxifloxacin exposure was associated with a 5-fold in-
creased
risk
of
respiratory
system
malformations
and
ofloxacin use with an 8-fold increased risk of MCMs. How-
ever, these results should be interpreted with caution given
the small number of exposed cases.
Teratogenicity of quinolone has been reported in the
literature in animal and experimental studies [50, 51].
Indeed, quinolones can act as DNA gyrase inhibitors and
also as mitotic inhibitors [52]. This may partially damage
DNA and induce fetal malformation, which supports our
findings [52].
Doxycycline use was associated with a 2-fold increased
risk
of
circulatory
system
malformation
and
cardiac
malformations and 3-fold increased risk of ventricular/atrial
septal defect. These results are consistent with a previous
study that showed a 2-fold non-significant increased risk of
heart defects associated with the use of tetracycline as a class
[28]. It is known that tissue remodelling is involved in pla-
centa development [53]. Given that, doxycycline may inhibit

 the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and matrix
metalloproteinases known to play a role in tissue remodelling
[54]. This leads to placental anomalies that have been linked
to birth defects as well [55].
Clindamycin exposure was associated with a 34% in-
creased risk of MCMs including a 67% increased risk of mus-
culoskeletal system malformation and an 81% increased risk
of ventricular/atrial septal defect. To our knowledge, no pre-
vious studies have investigated the risk of MCMs or organ de-
fects associated specifically with this antibiotic. Clindamycin
has been classified as a nitrosatable drug (tertiary amine)
given its chemical structure [56, 57]. Studies reported that
nitrosatable drugs were associated with an increased risk of
many congenital malformations including heart and muscu-
loskeletal system malformations [56, 57]. Nitrosatable drugs
form N-nitroso compounds in the presence of nitrite under
highly acidic environments such as human stomach [58].
These
N-nitroso
compounds
may
therefore
induce
congenital
abnormalities
through
DNA
alkylation
of
embryonic cells [59, 60].
Nitrofurantoin exposure was not associated with MCMs
or organ-specific MCMs. This result was consistent with a
meta-analysis that found similar results with cohort studies
[32]. Conversely, our findings were different from the meta-
analysis based on case control studies [32]. These discrepan-
cies may be explained by the potential recall bias found in
case control studies.
Metronidazole use did not increase the risk of MCMs or
organ-specific MCMs as in previous studies [34]. However,
this finding should be interpreted with caution given that
our team has recently shown a link between spontaneous
abortion (SA) and metronidazole exposure [61]. Given that
SA are proxies of severe birth defects [62], ours results may
have underestimated the true risk.
The strengths of our study included the use of QPC,
which is a population-based cohort including all pregnan-
cies in Quebec. This allowed us to avoid a potential selec-
tion
bias
and
to
evaluate
the
association
between
individual antibiotics and specific malformations. Our co-
hort included also information on filled prescription and
physician records collected prospectively which limits the
potential for recall and detection bias. Another strength
encompassed the use of validated data on antibiotics pre-
scriptions and MCMs, which were validated against mater-
nal reports and medical charts, respectively [39, 40]. We
also used a validated gestational age which allowed us to
determine an accurate time window of interest [35]. We in-
cluded several potential confounders including maternal
infections, and we conducted a sensitivity analysis using
penicillin as a comparator group to further take into ac-
count confounding by indication. We investigated the rela-
tion
between
individual
antibiotics
and
organ-specific
MCMs.
A potential limitation included missing information on
potentially important confounders such as smoking, folic
acid and alcohol intake. However, we indirectly adjusted for
lifestyle by design given that we used penicillin exposure as
comparator groups.
Though we adjusted for many potential confounders
including maternal infections and comorbidities, residual
confounding could not be completely ruled out.

 Given that many comparisons were made in our study,
we cannot rule out chance finding. However, by reducing
the type 1 error, multiple test adjustments may increase
the type II error (i.e. the probability of accepting the null
hypothesis when the alternative is true) for those associa-
tions that are not null [63, 64]. Therefore we did not adjust
for multiple testing in our study to avoid missing impor-
tant findings [64]. In addition, our results were consistent
with
previous
published
studies
on
major
congenital
malformations, and biological plausibility explained our
finding as well.
Like in previous studies, only pregnancies with live single-
ton birth were considered in our research. Exclusion of SA, a
determinant of severe defects, may have underestimated the
true risk of MCM following gestational antibiotic exposure,
as these drugs could have caused SA. Lately, our team has re-
cently
reported
that
metronidazole,
azithromycin,
clarithromycin, sulfonamides, quinolones and tetracyclines
increased the risk of SA [61]. Nonetheless, even if our esti-
mates may have been underestimated, they should remain
conservative.
The prevalence of MCMs in our cohort was higher than
in other studies (3–5%). However, our rate is consistent
with what is expected in the province of Quebec, due to
increased
genetic
risk
stemming
from
the
‘founding’
French ancestor [65]. Therefore, as the prevalence of MCMs
is high irrespective of our exposure status, there is no rea-
son to believe that it will affect our internal validity given
that it will be cancelled out when comparing exposed and
unexposed groups.
Some of our analyses investigating the association be-
tween individual antibiotics and specific malformations
were underpowered given the small number of exposed
cases.
Absolute risks for musculoskeletal system malformations
and cardiac malformation were 1.3% and 1% respectively in
Quebec [66]. Therefore a 67% increase of musculoskeletal
system malformations in pregnant women exposed to
clindamycin would result in an increase in the absolute risks
from 1.3% to 2.1%. Similarly a twofold increase of the risk
of cardiac malformations following an exposure to doxycy-
cline during pregnancy would increase the absolute risks to
2%. Despite the fact that the absolute risks remain small, phy-
sicians should consider prescribing safer antibiotics for the
treatment of maternal infections when possible.
Finally,
our
cohort
included
women
of
low
socio-
economic status insured by the RAMQ for their medications.
Bérard and Lacasse [67] have shown that socioeconomic
status was an effect modifier in the QPC. Therefore, internal
validity of our results should not be affected.
Conclusion
In this large population-based cohort, we found that in
utero exposure to
clindamycin,
doxycycline, macrolide,
quinolone and phenoxymethylpenicillin increased the risk
of organ-specific MCMS in infants. Reassuringly amoxicil-
lin, cephalosporins and nitrofurantoin did not increase
the risk of MCMs or any organ-specific malformation.
Although the absolute risk for specific birth defects was
small, physicians should consider prescribing safer antibi-
otics for the treatment of maternal infections when possi-
ble until more data are available.
