IMPORTANCE Allergic diseases are prevalent in childhood. Early exposure to medications that
can alter the microbiome, including acid-suppressive medications and antibiotics, may
influence the likelihood of allergy.
OBJECTIVE To determine whether there is an association between the use of
acid-suppressive medications or antibiotics in the first 6 months of infancy and development
of allergic diseases in early childhood.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A retrospective cohort study was conducted in 792 130
children who were Department of Defense TRICARE beneficiaries with a birth medical record
in the Military Health System database between October 1, 2001, and September 30, 2013,
with continued enrollment from within 35 days of birth until at least age 1 year. Children who
had an initial birth stay of greater than 7 days or were diagnosed with any of the outcome
allergic conditions within the first 6 months of life were excluded from the study. Data
analysis was performed from April 15, 2015, to January 4, 2018.
EXPOSURES Exposures were defined as having any dispensed prescription for a histamine-2
receptor antagonist (H2RA), proton pump inhibitor (PPI), or antibiotic.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The main outcome was allergic disease, defined as the
presence of food allergy, anaphylaxis, asthma, atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, allergic
conjunctivitis, urticaria, contact dermatitis, medication allergy, or other allergy.
RESULTS Of 792 130 children (395 215 [49.9%] girls) included for analysis, 60 209 (7.6%)
were prescribed an H2RA, 13 687 (1.7%) were prescribed a PPI, and 131 708 (16.6%) were
prescribed an antibiotic during the first 6 months of life. Data for each child were available for
a median of 4.6 years. Adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) in children prescribed H2RAs and PPIs,
respectively, were 2.18 (95% CI, 2.04-2.33) and 2.59 (95% CI, 2.25-3.00) for food allergy, 1.70
(95% CI, 1.60-1.80) and 1.84 (95% CI, 1.56-2.17) for medication allergy, 1.51 (95% CI, 1.38-1.66)
and 1.45 (95% CI, 1.22-1.73) for anaphylaxis, 1.50 (95% CI, 1.46-1.54) and 1.44 (95% CI,
1.36-1.52) for allergic rhinitis, and 1.25 (95% CI, 1.21-1.29) and 1.41 (95% CI, 1.31-1.52) for
asthma. The aHRs after antibiotic prescription in the first 6 months of life were 2.09 (95% CI,
2.05-2.13) for asthma, 1.75 (95% CI, 1.72-1.78) for allergic rhinitis, 1.51 (95% CI, 1.38-1.66) for
anaphylaxis, and 1.42 (95% CI, 1.34-1.50) for allergic conjunctivitis.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study found associations between the use of
acid-suppressive medications and antibiotics during the first 6 months of infancy and
subsequent development of allergic disease. Acid-suppressive medications and antibiotics
should be used during infancy only in situations of clear clinical benefit.

 T
he cumulative prevalence of allergic diseases and
asthma has risen over the past several decades. In par-
ticular,foodallergyhasexhibitedaparticularlybriskrise
in children.1-4 Furthermore, studies in the United States and
other countries have demonstrated increases in allergic rhi-
noconjunctivitis, asthma, skin prick test positivity to com-
mon allergens, and hospitalizations due to anaphylaxis.5-9
An area of environmental change that may be contribut-
ing to the rise of allergic diseases is the increasing use of
medications that alter the development of the human
microbiome. Both gastric acid–suppressive medications and
antibiotics have been implicated as factors that may
enhance the development of allergic diseases.10-13 Use of
these medications, which can directly cause intestinal dys-
biosis, is of concern in light of increasing evidence that
alterations in the human microbiome can increase the risk
for allergy development.11,14,15 Furthermore, acid-
suppressive medications, which reduce protein digestion,
can affect how ingested antigens are processed in the intes-
tinal tract. Acid suppression has been shown to increase
immunoglobulin (Ig) E production in response to orally
ingested antigens in animal studies16,17 and has been associ-
ated with food and medication allergy in humans.18-20
The objective of this study was to evaluate the hypoth-
esis that exposure to either acid-suppressive medications or
antibiotics during infancy is associated with an increased
risk of childhood allergic diseases. We tested this hypothesis
by conducting a retrospective cohort analysis investigating
the development of allergy in children in the TRICARE Man-
agement Activity Military Health System (MHS) database.
Methods
Data Source and Inclusion Criteria
A retrospective cohort study was performed using the
TRICARE Management Activity MHS database. TRICARE
Management Activity oversees health care delivery for US
uniformed service members and their dependents. The
MHS database includes all outpatient and inpatient billing
records as well as outpatient pharmacy use for all eligible
uniformed services members and their dependents in both
military and civilian facilities. The database includes billing
data for military patients seen outside the direct care mili-
tary system. The MHS database was queried to identify all
children eligible for health care starting at birth. To be
included in the study, children must have had a birth medi-
cal record in the database between October 1, 2001, and
September 30, 2013, and continued enrollment from within
35 days of birth until at least age 1 year. Also, children who
were diagnosed with any of the outcome allergic conditions
within the first 6 months of life were excluded from the
study, as were children who had incomplete enrollment or
demographic data and children who had an initial birth stay
of greater than 7 days (Figure 1).
The study was reviewed and approved by the institu-
tional review board of the Uniformed Services University
with waiver of informed consent. Data were deidentified.
Variable Definitions
The MHS database was used to identify children prescribed
an outpatient histamine-2 receptor antagonist (H2RA), pro-
ton pump inhibitor (PPI), or antibiotic at any time prior to
age 6 months using the American Hospital Formulary Ser-
vice classification (listed in eTable 1 in the Supplement).21
The name of the medication, the number of days supplied,
and the age at which the prescription was dispensed were
extracted for each eligible child. Exposures for the primary
analysis were defined as binary time-fixed variables, cat-
egorically defined as any dispensed H2RA, PPI, or antibiotic
in the first 6 months of life.
Allergic disease outcomes were defined using the Inter-
national Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical
Modification (ICD-9-CM) diagnostic codes. For each child,
the outcomes were evaluated from age 6 months and cen-
sored at time of health care disenrollment or the end of the
study (September 30, 2014). Each child’
s outpatient and
inpatient medical visits were extracted using MHS claim
files from October 1, 2001, to September 30, 2014. An event
was defined as the first medical encounter with the specific
allergic condition categorized by ICD-9-CM diagnostic codes
listed in eTable 2 in the Supplement. Additional variables
obtained using ICD-9-CM codes included prematurity and
birth by cesarean delivery (eTable 2 in the Supplement).
Statistical Analysis
We summarized continuous data with medians and inter-
quartile ranges (IQRs) and categorical data with numbers
and percentages. Because the medication groups were not
mutually exclusive, comparison of demographics and other
variables for children receiving H2RAs, PPIs, antibiotics, or
no medications were compared using repeated-measures
methods.22 Cox proportional hazards regression was used to
calculate the hazard ratio (HR) of developing an allergic con-
dition based on exposure to PPIs, H2RAs, and antibiotics in
the first 6 months of life. In the adjusted models, adjusted
HRs (aHRs) were calculated after adjusting for prematurity,
cesarean delivery, sex, the other drug classes, and any sig-
nificant first-order interaction terms. The Cox proportional
hazards regression assumption was evaluated by visual
inspection for parallelism of the log-log survival curves for
each variable in the models as well as evaluating correlation
Key Points
Question Does use of medications that disturb the microbiome in
infancy increase subsequent risk of developing allergic diseases?
Findings In this cohort study of 792 130 children, the hazard of
developing an allergic disease was significantly increased in those
who had received acid-suppressive medications or antibiotics
during the first 6 months of life.
Meaning Exposure to acid-suppressive medications or antibiotics
in the first 6 months of life may increase risk of allergic disease
development.

 of the Schoenfeld residuals with time. When variables vio-
lated the Cox proportional hazards regression assumption
with either log-log curves that were not parallel or the
Schoenfeld residuals with time were significant, an interac-
tion of the variable with time was included in the model.23
For evaluating whether there is a dose-related risk of
developing allergy, patient groups receiving H2RAs or PPIs
were divided into those receiving no medication, 1 to 60
days of medication, and more than 60 days of medication.
For antibiotic use, low and high doses were defined as up to
and including 10 days and over 10 days of antibiotics. Cutoff
levels for low and high doses of acid-suppressive medica-
tions and antibiotics were based on median days prescribed.
Cox proportional hazards regression was used to evaluate
the HR for these medication groups. Estimated survival
curves based on the Cox proportional hazards regression
models were constructed for visualization purposes.24 In
addition, a subanalysis was performed to evaluate the effect
of medications among those who had a diagnosis of gastro-
esophageal reflux disease (GERD). Data analysis was con-
ducted from April 15, 2015, to January 4, 2018.
Two-tailed P values <.05 were considered statistically
significant. Analyses were conducted using SAS, version 9.4
(SAS Institute Inc).
Results
Patient Characteristics and Use of Acid-Suppressive
Medications and Antibiotics
A total of 792 130 children had birth medical records in the da-
tabase between October 1, 2001, and September 30, 2013, and
metallotherinclusioncriteria(Figure1).Duringthefirst6months
of life, 60 209 children (7.6%) were prescribed an H2RA, 13 687
(1.7%)wereprescribedaPPI,and131708(16.6%)wereprescribed
anantibiotic(Table1).Severalchildrenwereprescribedmultiple
medications. Of all children, 12 546 (1.6%) received H2RAs and
antibiotics, 5520 (0.7%) received H2RAs and PPIs, 1590 (0.2%)
receivedPPIsandantibiotics,and2549(0.3%)receivedall3medi-
cations. Data for each child were available for a median of 4.6
years (IQR, 2.5-7.9).
ThemostfrequentlyusedH2RAwasranitidine,accounting
for95.1%ofallH2RAprescriptions.Thenextmostfrequentlypre-
scribedH2RAswerenizatidineandfamotidine.Lansoprazolewas
themostcommonlyprescribedPPI,totaling75.5%ofalldayssup-
plied of PPI prescriptions. The median days supplied for both
H2RAs and PPIs was 60 (IQR for H2RAs, 39-92; IQR for
PPIs, 30-91).
Median days of antibiotics prescribed was 10 (IQR, 10-20),
andthetotalnumberofdayswasmorethan3.4million.Themost
commonclasseswerepenicillins,comprising65.3%ofthetotal
daysofprescribedantibiotics,cephalosporinscomprising14.2%,
and macrolides comprising 10.1%. The top 3 individual antibi-
otics prescribed were amoxicillin (55.0%), amoxicillin clavula-
nate (9.0%), and trimethoprim with sulfamethoxazole (8.7%).
Among those prescribed antibiotics in the first 6 months of life,

prescription for both H2RAs (61 days: IQR, 37-94) and PPIs (73
days: IQR, 47-117).
A greater percentage of boys was prescribed H2RAs (32 052
[8.1%]),PPIs(7491[1.9%]),andantibiotics(70 933[17.9%])than
girls (28 157 [7.1%] for H2RAs; 6196 [1.6%] for PPIs; and 60 775
[15.4%]forantibiotics;P < .001forallcomparisons).Premature
infants were more likely to be prescribed H2RAs (4177 [13.4%])
and PPIs (1040 [3.3%]) than full-term infants (56 032 [7.4%] for
H2RAs; 12 647 [1.7%] for PPIs; P < .001 for both comparisons).
There was no significant difference in the percentage of chil-
dren born prematurely given antibiotics compared with full-
term infants (5212 [16.8%] vs 126 496 [16.1%]; P = .46).
Allergy Diagnoses
Of the 792 130 children in this cohort, 24 514 (58.7/10 000
person-years) were diagnosed with a food allergy. Among
the identified food allergies, peanut allergy was the most

 common (13.8/10 000 person-years), followed by cow’
s milk
allergy (10.7/10,000 person-years) and egg allergy (7.2/
10 000 person-years) (Table 2).
With regard to other allergic diseases, the 2 most com-
mon diagnoses were allergic rhinitis (771.5/10 000 person-
years) and contact dermatitis (703.2/10 000 person-years).
The next most common nonfood allergies were atopic der-
matitis (300.0/10 000 person-years), asthma (297.7/10 000
person-years), and urticaria (180.4/10 000 person-years)
(Table 2).
All covariates analyzed exhibited a statistically signifi-
cant association with allergic disease (eTable 3 in the
Supplement). A greater percentage of boys developed an
allergic condition than girls (59.5% vs 56.6%; P < .001). Chil-
dren born by cesarean delivery and those born prematurely
also demonstrated an increased risk of allergic disease com-
pared with children without those conditions (59.4% vs
57.5% and 59.0% vs 58.0%, respectively; P < .001 for both).
Association Between Acid-Suppressive Medications
and Allergic Diseases
Every allergic disease assessed exhibited a significantly
increased risk in children who had received H2RAs or PPIs
during infancy except for seafood allergy (Table 3), which
had the lowest incidence of the conditions evaluated
(Table 2). Adjusted HRs were greatest for food allergies as a
category, with an aHR of 2.18 for H2RAs (95% CI, 2.04-2.33)
and an aHR of 2.59 (95% CI, 2.25-3.00) for PPIs. Of the spe-
cific types of food allergies, use of acid-suppressive medica-
tions increased the risk of being diagnosed with cow’
s milk
allergy the most (aHR, 2.42; 95% CI, 2.22-2.64 for H2RAs
and aHR, 4.43; 95% CI, 3.48-5.65 for PPIs). For children who
received H2RAs, the aHRs for developing peanut, egg, or
other food allergies were 1.21 (95% CI, 1.09-1.33), 1.74 (95%
CI, 1.52-1.99), and 2.13 (95% CI, 1.98-2.30), respectively.
Similarly, prescription of PPIs during infancy was associated
with an aHR for peanut, egg, or other food allergies of 1.27
(95% CI, 1.05-1.52), 1.35 (95% CI, 1.08-1.69), and 2.68 (95%
CI, 2.23-3.20), respectively. Consistent with the entire study
population, children diagnosed with GERD during infancy
also demonstrated increased incidence densities and aHRs
for food allergy after treatment with H2RAs and PPIs
(eTables 4 and 5 in the Supplement).
Risk of food allergy after treatment with acid-suppres-
sive medications exhibited a dose-dependent effect with re-
gard to days of medication prescribed (antibiotic short dura-

 tion indicates 10 or fewer days; long duration, 11 or more days;
H2RA and PPI short duration, 60 or fewer days; long dura-
tion,61ormoredays)(Figure2).Childrenprescribedmorethan
60 days of PPIs had a 52% greater risk of being diagnosed with
food allergy during childhood than those prescribed 1 to 60
days of PPIs (aHR of food allergy in children prescribed >60
days vs 1-60 days of PPIs: 1.52; 95% CI, 1.32-1.74). A dose-
dependent effect was also observed with H2RAs (aHR of food
allergy in children prescribed >60 days of H2RA vs 1-60 days:
1.32; 95% CI, 1.23-1.43).
All nonfood allergic diseases studies also were found to be
significantly associated with the use of acid-suppressive medi-
cationtherapyduringinfancy(Table3).Ofthenonfoodallergy–
related conditions, the allergic diseases exhibiting the great-
est increased risk after acid-suppressive therapy were
medication allergy (aHR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.60-1.80 for H2RAs and
1.84;95%CI,1.56-2.17forPPIs),allergicrhinitis(aHR,1.50;95%
CI, 1.46-1.54 for H2RAs and 1.44; 95% CI, 1.36-1.52 for PPIs),
anaphylaxis (aHR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.38-1.66 for H2RAs and 1.45;
95% CI, 1.22-1.73 for PPIs), and other allergy (aHR, 1.63; 95%
CI,1.55-1.71forH2RAsand1.62;95%CI,1.45-1.80forPPIs).Acid-
suppressive medication therapy was also associated with a
marked increase in asthma, allergic conjunctivitis, and urti-
caria during childhood.
Association Between Antibiotics and Allergic Diseases
As with acid-suppressive medications, prescriptions for anti-
biotics during infancy also were significantly associated with
an increased risk of allergic diseases. The aHR for develop-
ment of any food allergy was 1.14 (95% CI, 1.10-1.18) in chil-
dren who had received antibiotics. While neither peanut al-
lergy nor seafood allergy exhibited significantly increased risk,
antibiotic use during infancy was associated with an in-
creased risk of both cow’
s milk allergy and egg allergy (aHR,
1.24 for both; 95% CI, 1.15-1.33 for cow’
s milk allergy and 95%
CI, 1.13-1.37 for egg allergy). Unlike acid-suppressive medica-
tions, antibiotics did not demonstrate a dose-dependent risk
for development of food allergy (aHR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.99-1.11
for developing any food allergy in children prescribed >10 days
of antibiotics compared with children prescribed 1-10 days)
(Figure 2C).
Several nonfood allergic diseases were significantly in-
creased in children who had received antibiotics during in-
fancy. Antibiotics prescribed during infancy were associated
with a greater than 2-fold risk of asthma in childhood (aHR,
2.09; 95% CI, 2.05-2.13). Risks of anaphylaxis (aHR, 1.51; 95%
CI, 1.38-1.66), allergic conjunctivitis (aHR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.34-
1.50),andmedicationallergy(aHR,1.34;95%CI,1.29-1.40)also
were significantly increased in children who had received an-
tibioticsasinfants(Table3).Inaddition,theincidenceofatopic
dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, contact dermatitis, urticaria, and
other allergies were significantly increased in children who
were prescribed antibiotics during infancy (Table 3).
Discussion
In this retrospective cohort study of 792 130 children, we
found significant associations between the use of acid-
suppressive medications or antibiotics in infancy and the
development of allergic diseases in childhood. Use of acid-
suppressive medications was positively associated with
increased risks for all major categories of allergic disease and
most strongly associated with food allergy. Infants pre-
scribed H2RAs and PPIs during the first 6 months of infancy
exhibited respective aHRs for food allergy of 2.18 and 2.59.
Antibiotics were also significantly associated with all major
categories of allergic disease. The aHRs after antibiotic pre-
scription in the first 6 months of life were 2.09 for asthma,
1.14 for food allergy, and 1.40 or greater for anaphylaxis,
allergic rhinitis, and allergic conjunctivitis. This study adds
to the mounting evidence that agents that disrupt the nor-
mal intestinal microbiome during infancy may increase the
development of allergic diseases.

 With respect to acid-suppressive medications, both adults
and children have been shown to have a greater risk of food
allergy after a course of acid-suppressive therapy.18,20 Acid-
suppressive medications may enhance allergic responses not
only to food allergens but also to nonfood allergens. In our
study, all of the nonfood allergies examined were signifi-
cantly increased in children who had received H2RAs or PPIs
during infancy. Our results are consistent with those of a mu-
rine study that observed increased levels of allergen-specific
IgE following intraperitoneal sensitization with cimetidine,25
as well as with a human study in Spain that found that use of
PPIs during hospitalization is associated with increased risks
of allergy to injected and orally administered medications.19
Our results are also in line with those of prior investiga-
tions that suggest a link between administration of antibiot-
ics early in life and subsequent development of allergic dis-
eases. A systematic review published in 2011 found that
children given antibiotics in the first year of life had a pooled
odds ratio of 1.52 for risk of allergy.26 Similarly, a recent retro-
spective study of 30 060 children in the United States found
strong associations between antibiotic use in the first 3 months
of life and subsequent development of food and nonfood al-
lergic diseases.27 In our study, food allergy, atopic dermatitis,
urticaria, contact dermatitis, medication allergy, allergic con-
junctivitis, and anaphylaxis were increased by 9% to 51% in
children who had been prescribed antibiotics during the first
6 months of life. Antibiotics were associated with an even
greater risk for development of allergic diseases triggered by
aeroallergens. Asthma was increased by over 100% and aller-
gic rhinitis by 75% in children exposed to antibiotics during in-
fancy.
While not fully understood, potential mechanisms by
which acid-suppressive medications and antibiotics can in-
crease allergic sensitization include intestinal dysbiosis and,
for acid-suppressive medications, decreased protein diges-
tion in the stomach.13 There is mounting evidence from hu-
man and animal studies that a diverse microbiome plays a cen-
tral role in the development of a healthy immune system and
that perturbations in the microbiome can increase the risk for
allergic diseases.11,14,15,28,29 Studies suggest that healthy nor-

Conclusions
To our knowledge, this is the largest study demonstrating
an association between H2RAs, PPIs, and antibiotics given
during infancy and the subsequent development of allergic
diseases. The results are consistent with those of prior stud-
ies and have biological plausibility. Thus, this study pro-
vides further impetus that antibiotics and acid-suppressive
medications should be used during infancy only in situa-
tions of clear clinical benefit. Additional studies will be
required to confirm causality and determine the mechanism
of action.
