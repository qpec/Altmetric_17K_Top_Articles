Abstract
Background: Diabetes and its concurrent complications impact a significant proportion of the population of the
US and create a large financial burden on the American health care system. FDA-approved maggot debridement
therapy (MDT), the application of sterile laboratory-reared Lucilia sericata (green bottle fly) larvae to wounds, is a
cost-effective and successful treatment for diabetic foot ulcers and other medical conditions. Human platelet
derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) is a secreted dimeric peptide growth factor that binds the PDGF receptor.
PDGF-BB stimulates cell proliferation and survival, promotes wound healing, and has been investigated as a possible
topical treatment for non-healing wounds. Genetic engineering has allowed for expression and secretion of human
growth factors and other proteins in transgenic insects. Here, we present a novel concept in MDT technology that
combines the established benefits of MDT with the power of genetic engineering to promote healing. The focus of
this study is to create and characterize strains of transgenic L. sericata that express and secrete PDGF-BB at detectable
levels in adult hemolymph, whole larval lysate, and maggot excretions/ secretions (ES), with potential for clinical utility
in wound healing.
Results: We have engineered and confirmed transgene insertion in several strains of L. sericata that express
human PDGF-BB. Using a heat-inducible promoter to control the pdgf-b gene, pdgf-b mRNA was detected via
semi-quantitative PCR upon heat shock. PDGF-BB protein was also detectable in larval lysates and adult hemolymph
but not larval ES. An alternative, tetracycline-repressible pdgf-b system mediated expression of pdgf-b mRNA when
maggots were raised on diet that lacked tetracycline. Further, PDGF-BB protein was readily detected in whole larval
lysate as well as larval ES.
Conclusions: Here we show robust, inducible expression and production of human PDGF-BB protein from two
conditional expression systems in transgenic L. sericata larvae. The tetracycline-repressible system appears to
be the most promising as PDGF-BB protein was detectable in larval ES following induction. Our system could
potentially be used to deliver a variety of growth factors and anti-microbial peptides to the wound environment with
the aim of enhancing wound healing, thereby improving patient outcome in a cost-effective manner.

 Background
Diabetes is a global health care issue. Three hundred-
eighty-two million people were reported to have diabetes
in 2013 (http://www.diabetesatlas.org). Additionally, the
cost of diabetic foot ulcers to the American health care
system was estimated to be $9–13 billion in addition to
care for diabetes in 2013 [1]. Maggot debridement
therapy
(MDT)
is
a
cost-effective,
FDA-approved
treatment for diabetic foot ulcers [2, 3]. MDT com-
monly involves the application of sterile Lucilia seri-
cata
larvae
to
a
non-healing
wound
to
promote
healing and decrease infection. MDT has been applied
successfully in more than 20 additional medical con-
ditions [4, 5].
MDT promotes healing in part through digestion and
mechanical removal of necrotic tissue. Debridement is a
critical component of effective wound healing [4, 6]. En-
zyme application and mechanical debridement have
been studied in clinical trials, but challenges such as ex-
pense and potential damage to healthy tissue stunt the
large-scale effectiveness of these treatment options [7].
In contrast, larvae leave behind healthy tissue. Larvae
have been shown to ingest fluorescent bacteria in vitro
[8] as well as raise the pH of the wound environment via
excretions and secretions (ES), which results in inhib-
ition of bacterial growth [9]. Most of the in vitro studies
found that ES was more effective at inhibiting growth of
gram positive than gram negative bacteria [10]. Further,
in one small vivo study, sterile maggots were found to
be more effective at inhibiting growth of gram positive
bacteria in infected wounds [11]. Specific factors and
fractions have been identified within ES that exhibit
antibacterial activity in vitro [12]. For example, the
insect defensin homologue lucifensin was detected in
the gut and salivary glands of L. sericata larvae and
identified in wound washings from MDT patients
[13]. Lucifensin exhibited antibacterial activity against
a panel of Gram positive bacteria [13, 14]. Some data
suggests expression and secretion of antibacterial fac-
tors by larvae is not constitutive, but induced by the
wound environment [15–17]. The antibacterial mech-
anisms of MDT are free from the limitations of anti-
biotic resistance frequently seen in the clinic. Indeed,
maggot debridement therapy has been shown to be
effective in treatment of MRSA in vitro as well as in
clinical case studies [18].
It is clear from these studies that larvae significantly
alter the wound environment during MDT. Maggot ES
may also alter the local inflammatory response. For ex-
ample, L. sericata ES modulate neutrophil migration and
adhesion and alter expression of pattern recognition re-
ceptor levels [19]. ES also increased the secretion of anti-
inflammatory cytokine IL-10, while inhibiting secretion of
pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and IL-12p40 [20].
In addition to the impact of MDT on the immune re-
sponse in the wound, MDT also promotes wound heal-
ing through formation of granulation tissue [21, 22].
This could be a consequence of the physical action of
the maggots in the wound, removal of dead tissue,
change of wound pH and microbial killing [10]. In
addition, there is some evidence that maggot ES could
stimulate growth of human cells in the wound. ES was
shown to stimulate fibroblast proliferation in culture
[23] and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) synthesis in
3T3 cells [24]. Further, increased HGF levels were mea-
sured in femoral vein blood of patient during MDT [24].
However, there is no evidence from randomized clinical
trials that MDT shortens wound healing times [25]. This
may reflect a limitation of the design of the trials [10]
but highlights the need for further studies on the pro-
motion of wound healing by maggots.
Studies
have
shown
decreased
concentrations
of
growth factors, including several isoforms of platelet-
derived growth factor (PDGF), in chronic wounds when
compared to acute wounds [26, 27]. This evidence pre-
cipitated investigation into topical recombinant growth
factor treatment as a means to promote healing in
chronic wounds. Several growth factors were investi-
gated, however molecular stability limited their success
despite the use of gels, micropheres, and other conju-
gates. Nevertheless, after achieving some pre-clinical and
clinical success, human PDGF-BB became the first FDA-
approved recombinant cytokine growth factor [28].
The role of PDGF in wound healing is well established
[29]. PDGF is a cationic hetero or homo-dimer consisting
of a combination of alpha and beta subunit chains con-
taining multiple intra- and inter-chain disulfide bonds.
The subunits are produced in a pro form by endothelial
cells, fibroblasts, immune system cells, and others [23].
The pro subunits dimerize in the endoplasmic reticulum
into homo or heterodimeric combinations. The pro di-
mers are further processed via N-terminal modification,
remodeling, and cleavage to a mature dimer form [30].
The mature dimers are secreted, where they interact
with the extra-cellular matrix (ECM) and cell surface
PDGF receptors. Via activation of the PDGF receptor
and subsequently PI3 kinase and mitogen-activated pro-
tein kinase (MAPK), PDGF stimulates cell survival, fibro-
blast proliferation and chemotaxis, actin reorganization,
and production and secretion of other growth factors,
ECM constituents, and metalloproteases [29]. Because of
the extensive role of PDGF in wound healing, clinical tri-
als have been done investigating the utility of a topical gel
(Becaplermin) containing recombinant human PDGF-BB
produced in Escherichia coli [31]. Immunostaining of
wounds treated with PDGF-BB showed increased fi-
broblasts,
increased
collagen
fibril
formation,
and
healing (as measured by decreased wound size) [32].

 In one study, ulcer surface area and time to complete
healing were both reduced significantly in patients re-
ceiving topical PDGF-BB along with standard wound
care, however, the authors purposefully selected large,
severe ulcers for inclusion in the study [33]. Similarly,
other trials reported increased healing and/or reduced
time to wound closure [34–41]. However, some trials
did not find that topical PDGF treatment significantly
improved wound healing [42–44]. The mixed out-
comes could reflect the complexity of the wound
healing process that involves mutiple factors, which
supports the need for a therapy that combines mul-
tiple mechanisms to promote wound healing.
Here, we present a novel concept in MDT technology
that combines the established benefits of MDT with the
potential power of engineered maggots to promote heal-
ing. Genetically modified larvae engineered to secrete se-
lected human growth factors or antibacterial peptides
effective against Gram positive and Gram negative bac-
teria could have the potential to synergistically improve
wound healing and result in shorter hospital stays. Given
the low cost of rearing maggots, the technology is likely
to be cost-effective compared to dressing gels containing
recombinant proteins. The objective of this study is to
determine if L. sericata can be engineered to condition-
ally express and secrete human PDGF-BB. PDGF-BB
was selected because PDGF-BB made in E. coli is active
and has been approved for use in wound treatment.
However, we view this study as proof-of-principle for
the future development of engineered L. sericata strains
that express a variety of growth factors and antimicrobial
peptides.
Results
Heat inducible expression of pdgf-b RNA in transgenic L.
sericata
A heat-inducible system was chosen for pdgf-b expres-
sion as it provides several advantages. If fitness costs
were observed, flies could be reared in non-permissive
conditions in order to obtain sufficient numbers of lar-
vae. Subsequently, during clinical application of larvae,
the wound temperature would generate the permissive
condition and induce pdgf-b expression. We previously
showed that the Lucilia cuprina hsp24 (Lchsp24) gene is
strongly induced by heat shock in first and third instar
larvae [45]. Further, several putative heat shock factor
binding sites were identified within 500 bp upstream of
the transcription start site. Thus the Lchsp24 promoter
was selected to make the heat inducible pdgf-b gene
construct, pB[Lchsp24-pdgf-B] (Fig. 1a). The Lchsp24
gene fragment contained 1016 bp upstream of the start
of transcription and 180 bp of the 5' UTR. The transla-
tion start codon was not included in the fragment. A
gene fragment encoding the mature active form of pdgf-b
gene was synthesized with a codon usage optimal for ex-
pression in Lucilia. To facilitate secretion from L. sericata
larvae, an amino terminal predicted signal peptide was in-
cluded in the synthesized pdgf-b gene. The signal peptide
was identified in a venom peptide that is expressed in L.
sericata larval salivary glands [46]. For polyadenylation of
pdgf-b transcripts, the gene construct contained the
3'UTR and 3' flanking DNA from a Lchsp70 gene. The
Lchsp24-pdgf-b-pA gene construct was inserted into a pig-
gyBac transformation vector used previously [47] (Fig. 1a.).
The vector contains a ZsGreen marker gene under the
control of a strong constitutive promoter (Lchsp83) for
identification of transgenic larvae.
L.
sericata
CA06
embryos
were
injected
with
pB[Lchsp24-pdgf-B] DNA and a piggyBac helper DNA/
RNA mixture [47, 48]. Four transgenic lines were ob-
tained from 18 G0 adults that developed from injected
embryos. Two lines showed the predicted Mendelian in-
heritance for a single transgene (e.g. crossing heterozy-
gotes with CA06 gave 50 % fluorescent offspring).
Molecular analysis (inverse PCR) also indicated that
these two lines (PD1 and PD2) carried a single copy of
the transgene. However, only the PD1 line was homozy-
gous viable and fertile and so this line was selected for

 further analysis. The nucleotide sequence adjacent to the
the transgene was determined by inverse PCR (Fig. 1b).
The transgene had inserted into a TTAA site, which is
typical for piggyBac-mediated transformation [49].
To determine if pdgf-b mRNA expression was indu-
cible by heat shock at 37 °C, RT-PCR was performed on
RNA isolated from PD-1 homozygous first instar larvae.
A DNA fragment of the correct size was detected from
the heat-treated (37 °C for 30 min) but not control lar-
vae (Fig. 1c). This suggests that the PD-1 line provides a
heat inducible system for pdgf-b expression.
Detection of PDGF-BB protein in PD-1 larval lysate
We next sought to determine whether or not the
human PDGF-BB protein was detectable in lysates of
transgenic
larvae.
A
commercial
ELISA
kit
was
chosen due to its high sensitivity (as low as 15 pg/mL,
according to the manufacturer). Further, ELISA assays
detect native protein, while western blots detect linear-
ized protein, allowing detection via antibodies against
discontinuous as well as continuous epitopes, thereby
further increasing likelihood of detection. For each
assay, a positive control his-tagged recombinant human
PDGF-BB was included, and yielded a positive signal
within the kit standard range (data not shown). CA06
control (wt) and PD-1 larvae were subjected to a 3 h at
37 °C heat shock, then snap frozen. Lysates were nor-
malized for total protein concentration and each sam-
ple was assayed in triplicate ELISA wells. PDGF-BB was
undetectable in control CA06 lysate (Fig. 2a). While
low basal levels of protein were detected in PD-1 larval
lysate at the control temperature (27 °C), the PDGF-BB
protein concentration increased 5–fold with heat shock
treatment (Fig. 2a). For any future clinical application it
is important that the PDGF-BB protein is secreted from
Lucilia cells and is present in larval ES. Thus we next
heat-shocked larvae in ES collection buffer and col-
lected the ES. However, PDGF-BB was not detectable in
larval secretions (data not shown). Total protein con-
centration was approximtely 10-fold lower in ES sam-
ples compared to whole larval lysates. As a result, the
amount of total ES protein loaded per ELISA well was
one tenth to one half that of lysates. It is possible that
PDGF-BB was present in the ES samples but below the
level of detection of the assay. We next collected pro-
tein from adult hemolymph, reasoning that the protein
concentration would be higher than larval ES. PDGF-
BB was detected in hemolymph isolated from adult PD-
1 flies after heat shock, albeit at a lower concentration
than lysates (Fig. 2b.) These data suggest that the trans-
genic expression system is functional, and that PDGF-
BB is secreted into the hemolymph from cells in which
it is expressed.
pdgf-b RNA expression in transgenic L. sericata regulated
by the tetracycline transactivator (tTA)
The above analysis suggested that higher levels of
PDGF-BB expression were needed to produce detect-
able levels in larval ES. We had also previously shown
that the “tet-OFF” system can lead to very high levels of
gene expression in transgenic Lucilia [48]. The tet-OFF
system is comprised of a tTA “Driver” construct and a
tTA-responsive “Effector” construct (Fig. 3a). The L.
cuprina hsp83 promoter is a strong constitutive pro-
moter in transgenic L. sericata [47]. Indeed, L. sericata
larvae expressing DsRedex2 and ZsGreen under the
control of this promoter appear light pink and greenish
yellow respectively under white light (Fig. 3c). We rea-
soned that if the strong hsp83 promoter was used to

 drive tTA expression, this would lead to very high levels
of the effector, which in this study would be pdgf-b.
Since the L. cuprina hsp83 promoter was used for the
marker gene, we isolated the hsp83 promoter from a
related blowfly, Cochliomyia hominivorax (Chhsp83).
The start of transcription of the Chhsp83 gene was
determined by 5' RACE, using oligonucleotide primers
based on a previously identified transcript [50]. The
exon-intron
arrangement
was
determined
by
PCR
with genomic DNA template and primers based on
the transcript. As for the Lchsp83 gene [45], the Chhsp83
gene contains one intron with the translation start codon
at the beginning of the second exon. A PCR-based gen-
ome walking approach was used to obtain the nucleotide
sequence of genomic DNA upstream from the start of
transcription. The DR4 driver construct contains a 3 kb
fragment from the Chhsp83 gene upstream of the tTA
coding region, followed by the SV40 polyadenylation se-
quence. The Chhsp83 fragment includes 2225 bp of up-
stream flanking DNA, the 200 bp 5' UTR and the 586 bp
first intron. The tTA translation start codon follows the
Chhsp83 intron. The Chhsp83-tTA gene cassette was
cloned in a piggyBac transformation vector with a
Lchsp83-ZsGreen marker gene. The EF-PDGF effector

region
and
SV40
polyadenylation sequence. The tetO21-Lchsp70 enhancer-
promoter was used previously to achieve high levels of
tTA gene expression in L. cuprina (autoregulated system)
[48]. The pdgf-b sequence with an N-terminal signal pep-
tide was the same as used above in the heat inducible sys-
tem. The tetO-pdgf-b gene cassette was cloned into a
piggyBac transformation vector with a Lchsp83-DsRedex2
marker gene.
Transgenic DR4 and EF-PDGF lines were obtained
by
piggyBac-mediated
transformation.
For
DR4,
9
lines were initially obtained from 137 G0. However,
the lines were weak and difficult to maintain. This is
mostly likely because high levels of tTA protein are
toxic to L. cuprina [48]. Consequently, only one line,
DR4#14, was maintained and this was propagated as
a mixture of heterozygotes and homozygotes. DR4
had been injected into L. cuprina embryos as part of
the effort to make male-only lines [51]. For this
study, it was necessary to introgress the DR4 trans-
gene into a L. sericata genetic background. This was
done
by
crossing
L.
cuprina
DR4#14
males
with
MDLA L. sericata females. The offspring were then
backcrossed for two generations with L. sericata fe-
males. The L. sericata EF-PDGF#11 line was obtained
from 32 G0 and bred to homozygosity. The nucleotide
sequence adjacent to the transgene insertion site was
determined by inverse PCR (Fig. 3b).
To induce pdgf-b expression, the DR4#14 driver
and and EF-PDGF#11 effector lines were crossed and
the larval offspring collected. In the presence of the
antibiotic tetracycline, tTA is bound by tetracycline
and rendered ineffective. In the absence of tetracyc-
line, however, tTA is able to bind to tetO in the ef-
fector construct and activate pdgf-b expression. Third
instar larvae of the driver strain express ZsGreen
marker, and appear yellow green in white light, while
third instar larvae of the effector strain express the
DsRedex2 marker and appear light pink. The progeny
of this cross with both transgenes appear bright pink
(Fig. 3c). This is most likely because tTA bound to
tetO
is
also
enhancing
expression
of
the
linked
marker gene from the Lchsp83 gene promoter. This
was previously observed in larvae that overexpress
tTA [48]. To confirm induction of pdgf-b transcript,
RNA was isolated and quantitative RT-PCR was per-
formed. pdgf-b transcript was readily detected in lar-
vae that contain one copy of each of the DR4 and
EF-PDGF transgenes. Control larvae (EF-PDGF only)
had
very
low
levels
of
pdgf-b
mRNA
expression
(Fig. 3d). In larvae that had both transgenes there
was a greater than 4000-fold increase in the level of
pdgf-b RNA (Fig. 3d).
PDGF-BB protein detection in whole larval lysate and ES
from larvae heterozygous for the DR4 tTA driver and
EF-PDGF effector
To determine if the larvae express and secrete PDGF-
BB, ELISA assays were performed on ES samples col-
lected from control EF-PDGF#11 larvae and larvae with
both the DR4 and EF-PDGF transgenes. As with the heat
inducible system, PDGF-BB was readily detected in
whole larval lysate from larvae with driver and effector
(Fig. 4a). When the more dilute ES samples were ana-
lyzed, total protein concentration was again much less
than for lysates (30-fold). Therefore, the amount of total
ES protein per ELISA well was one tenth to one half that
of lysates . However, PDGF-BB was detected in ES sam-
ples from larvae that have both DR4 and EF-PDGF

that human PDGF-B is produced and secreted from
third instar L. sericata larvae from a two-component
transgene expression system.
Discussion
Proteins
of
human
and
other
origins
have
been
expressed in insect cells in culture for decades [52].
More similar to our study, human protein has also been
expressed in tissue of insects using transient viral-based
[53] and transgenic systems [54]. For example, Medin
and
colleagues
reported
detection
of
recombinant
human adenosine deaminase, a primarily non-secreted
protein, in Trichoplusia ni larval lysate after injection of
a baculovirus-mediated transgene [53]. Interest in ex-
pressing heterologous proteins in insect larvae has arisen
from the desire for greater scale-up capabilities than is
feasible using cells in culture. A more recent study dem-
onstrated expression of a recombinant mouse anti-
botulinum antibody fragment (Fab) in Trichoplusia ni
larvae [55]. A secretory signal from Bombyx mori was
utlilized to facilitate secretion of the protein product
from larval cells, however, protein was purified from
whole larvae. Lastly, secreted human proteins, including
growth factors, have been expressed in Bombyx mori
and purified from hemolymph as well as larval/pupal
homogenate, and several of these proteins have proven
functional in the veterinary clinic [56]. We show here
for the first time that the translational and secretory
mechanisms of the L. sericata larvae is capable of produ-
cing a human growth factor from our transgene expres-
sion systems, and that this protein is indeed detectable
in hemolymph, larval lysate,and larval secretions. Further,
we introduce the first human transgene expression in a
larval host with potential for human clinical applications.
Two conditional systems were employed in this study,
one regulated by temperature and the other by addition
of tetracycline to the insect diet. The temperature-
regulated system was chosen because pdgf-b expression
would theoretically increase upon application of the lar-
vae to patient. Although pdgf-b expression driven by the
Lchsp24 promoter was heat-inducible in whole larvae,
we failed to detect PDGF-BB protein in maggot ES. Thus
this conditional expression system would not be useful
for any future clinical application. The D. melanogaster
hsp23 gene shows tissue-specificity and a cell-specific
heat-shock response [57], therefore it’s possible that
Lchsp24 promoter has low activity in Lucilia larval tis-
sues that excrete/secrete proteins found in ES. Neverthe-
less, our finding that the Lchsp24 promoter is active and
heat inducible could be useful for conditional expression
of other proteins in blow flies. Further, PDGF-BB was
detected in adult hemolymph after heat shock. This sug-
gests that the pre-protein was likely correctly processed
and secreted from Lucilia cells.
Using the two-component tet-OFF system, we have
demonstrated that human PDGF-BB can be expressed in
L. sericata larvae and detected in ES in an efficient indu-
cible system. With this conditional system, larvae would
be raised on diet without tetracycline to induce expres-
sion before wound application, thereby maximizing de-
livery of the secreted factor and healing potential. A
strain could be potentially engineered with several differ-
ent tetO-effector genes that would be co-regulated by
tTA. For example, the effector genes would be other
growth factors such as basic fibroblast growth factor
[58] and/or antimicrobial peptides such as lucifensin
[13] or Cecropin B [59]. The ES would be active against
a broad spectrum of bacterial species as lucifensin is active
against Gram positive bacteria [13] whereas Cecropin B is
particularly active against Gram negative bacteria [59].
In the long term, clinicians might have at their dis-
posal a panel of larvae expressing different factors for
each individual wound based on the species of bac-
teria present in an infection, stage of wound healing,
and level of inflammation.
The DR4 driver in our system may be further im-
proved. The DR4 driver is not the best choice for build-
ing strains intended for clinical application, as high
levels of tTA expression are toxic for Lucilia. A tTA
driver employing a larval salivary gland-specific gene
promoter would be advantageous [46, 60], as confining
tTA expression to one tissue would likely have a lower
fitness cost for the insect. Further, any effector protein
induced by tTA would be secreted from the salivary
gland. Alternatively, since larval excretions contribute to
maggot ES, tTA could be expressed in the gut using a
gut-specific promoter. The tet-OFF system could not be
utilized in the clinic if tetracycline or a derivative was
being used to treat an infected wound. If this proved to
be problematic, the two-component GAL4-UAS system,
widely used in Drosophila [61], could be considered for
protein expression in Lucilia. With this system, it should
be possible to achieve similar levels of protein expression
as with the tet-OFF system, however expression would
not be conditional. Lastly, with the identification of a L.
sericata microbiome [62], a paratransgenesis approach
[63] of utilizing a bacterial species to express a protein(s)
of interest in the gut of L. sericata maggots could be
considered.
As with any treatment modality, clinical application
of genetically modified L. sericata would require regu-
latory approval. A potential challenge for the utility of
modified MDT is patient attitude toward maggot ap-
plication. However, several studies indicate that pa-
tients will accept MDT [64, 65]. Indeed, Steenvoorde
Linger et al. BMC Biotechnology  (2016) 16:30 
Page 7 of 12
 et al., indicate that 89 % of patients surveyed would
undergo MDT again and 94 % would recommend it to
other patients [65]. Further, with the availability of
polymer Biobags or pouches made of nylon or chiffon
fabric [66], it may be possible to provide a liquid-
permeable barrier when applying sterile genetically
modified (GM) maggots to a wound, thereby making
the treatment significantly more tolerable for opposing
patients. It would also be anticipated that some patients
would reject treatment with GM maggots given the
public opposition to GM crops [67]. However, the GM
maggots could be more acceptable, as the use of a
fluorescent protein marker should facilitate thorough
removal of maggots from a wound after treatment. The
larvae
could
be
readily
visualized
using
goggles
equipped with the appropriate filter sets [68].
Future studies are in order to further characterize
the potential clinical utility of our system. Treatment
of cultured fibroblasts with ES samples to measure
MAPK activation, DNA synthesis, proliferation, and
motility using an in vitro wound assay would confirm
functionality of the secreted protein. Further, a rat
wound healing model has been created [69] that
would provide an excellent pre-clinical model.
Conclusions
Here we show robust, inducible production of human
pdgf-b RNA and PDGF-BB protein from two condi-
tional expression systems in transgenic L. sericata lar-
vae. With the heat-shock inducible system, PDGF-BB
protein was detectable in hemolymph and whole lar-
val lysate but not ES. The tTA-regulated system is
more promising as PDGF-BB protein was detected in
larval ES in addition to whole larval lysate from lar-
vae raised on diet without tetracycline. Potentially,
larvae could be engineered with several tTA regulated
genes
such
that
they
secrete/excrete
a
variety
of
growth factors and/or antimicrobial factors with the
aim of enhancing wound healing, thereby improving
patient outcome. The International Diabetes Feder-
ation reports that 80 % of people with diabetes live in
low or middle income countries (http://www.idf.org/
diabetesatlas). Enhanced MDT may be a cost-effective
solution for patients with less access to other treat-
ment modalities.
Methods
Insect rearing and germline transformation
The CA06 and MD wild type strains of L. sericata
were raised under similar conditions as described pre-
viously [48, 70]. To make the MDLA mixed strain, 16
MD males were mated with 30 CA06 virgin females,
the offspring collected and reared to adults. For heat
shock experiments, MDLA or L. sericata PD1 eggs
were placed on MYEA (50 g whole egg powder, 25 g
instant non-fat milk powder, 12.5 g inactivated dry
yeast, 7.5 g agar, 500 mL deionized water) at 27 °C
overnight. First instar larvae were transferred to a
new MYEA dish then heat shocked at 37 °C or left at
27 °C control for 3 h. The larvae were collected and
then washed with water using a filter, attached to an
aspirator. Larvae were then snap frozen in liquid ni-
trogen and stored at -80 °C. Introgression of the
DR4#14 line into a L. sericata genetic background
was done by crossing 125 DR4#14 L. cuprina males
with 80 MDLA virgin females. Male offspring were
then crossed with MDLA virgin females for two gen-
erations. The male and female offspring allowed to
breed freely to establish the line.
piggyBac-mediated germ-line
transformation
of
L.
sericata was as previously described [47, 48] using a
mixture of Lchsp83-pBac DNA (200 μg/mL) and in
vitro synthesized piggyBac RNA helper (300 μg/mL).
Homozygous Lucilia individuals were selected at the
wandering third instar larval stage based on fluores-
cence intensity and bred to create a stable line.
Plasmid construction
To make the pB[Lchsp24-pdgf-B] construct, firstly the
Lchsp24 promoter [45] was amplified from L. cuprina
genomic DNA with the primer pair 5'-GAGCTCCTCG
AGTAGGGTGGGCAATTTTTTCTAATGCCCATTA-3'
and 5'-GGATCCTGGATAGGCTTCACGGTCCAGTTC
ATCGAT-3' and the fragment inserted into pBAC2
vector [47]. The Lchsp70 3' UTR and 3' flanking DNA
[45] were amplified from L. cuprina genomic DNA with
the primer pair 5'-AAGCTTAGTCAATCTCAATTTC
ATTCC-3'
and
5'-GCGGCCGCCTCGAGAATGATAT
ATACAAGGA-3',
and
inserted
downstream
of
the
Lchsp24 promoter. However, the Lchsp24 promoter frag-
ment retained the start codon, so this was removed by
amplification of a portion of Lchsp24 without the start
codon with the primer pair 5'-ATTATCATTATCTACT
AGTTCAGTTCTAGTTAC-3' and 5'-ATTATCGGATC
CCTCTTTGGTTTTCTTAAA ACG -3', then digested
with SpeI and BamHI(blunt) and inserted into SpeI and
AgeI(blunt) of pB[Lchsp24-pl-Lchsp70], effectively re-
placing the promoter with an identical fragment minus
the ATG codon. A DNA fragment was synthesized by
Genscript that encoded the human PDGF-B protein and
a 20 amino acid signal peptide (MKSFLLVLFAFLAV-
FAFVQA) from an 87 amino acid venom peptide that
was expressed in L. sericata salivary glands [46] and de-
tected in larval ES (P.H. Nibbering, personal communi-
cation). The nucleotide sequence was optimized for
expression in L. cuprina. The pdgf-B Genscript plasmid
was digested with flanking Asp718 (blunt) and AvrII
and
inserted
into
NheI
(blunt)
and
AvrII

 pBAC2[Lchsp24-Lchsp70]. A PspOMI and partial SpeI
digest of pB[Lchsp83-ZsGreen-tub.2] [47] released a
3.3 kb Lchsp83-ZsGreen-tub.2 cassette which was inserted
into PspOMI and SpeI of pBSII KS+. The resulting pBSII
KS+[Lchsp83-ZsGreen-tub.2] plasmid was digested with
NotI and PspOMI and inserted into NotI digested
pB[Lchsp24- pdgfB -Lchsp70] to create the final piggyBac
transformation vector, pB[Lchsp24-pdgf-B].
To construct DR4 and EF-PDGF, the general strat-
egy was to first assemble the driver or effector gene
cassette in the cloning vector pBluescript II KS (-)
and then excise the gene cassette by digestion with
XhoI and NotI and clone into the unique XhoI and
PspOMI sites in the piggyBac transformation vectors
pB[Lchsp83-ZsGreen]
[47]
or
pB[Lchsp83-DsRedex2]
[48]. To assemble the effector construct, a fragment
encoding PDGF-B with N terminal signal peptide was
amplified from pB[Lchsp24-pdgf-B] using the primer pair
5'-TTATCATGAAGTCGTTCTTGTTGGTGTTG-3' and
5'-TGAAAGCTTAGGTCACGGGACGGGCGGCAG-3',
digested with BspHI and HindIII, and ligated to pBS-
FL11 (Li et al. [48]) that had been digested with NcoI
and HindIII. The effector gene cassette was then
excised from the pBS-EF-PDGF plasmid and ligated
with the pB[Lchsp83-DsRedex2] transformation vector.
For 5' RACE, total RNA was extracted from C. homini-
vorax embryos using TRI reagent (Sigma). polyA+ RNA
was purified by oligo-dT chromatography (Sigma). 5'
RACE-ready cDNA was prepared using the SMARTer
RACE cDNA amplification kit (Takara) according to the
manufacturers instructions. RACE-ready cDNAs were di-
luted in 20 μL TE buffer (Clontech), and then 2 μL was
used for 5' RACE with the primer 5'-CAATTCACGCAA
GAAAATCTCTTTGTTGGAATAGAAGGT-3'. “Genome
walker” libraries were prepared from C. hominivorax
genomic DNA using the Universal GenomeWalker kit
(Takara) following the manufacturers instructions. PCR
was then performed using the Chhsp83 gene specific
primers (GSP) 5'-GATCAACCACAATCTAATATATTAT
AACTTTTTTCACTTTTCAGTT-3'
and
5'-TTGTCT
TTTCGCTCGCTTGGAAACTCTCGATGTAT-3'. The
Chhsp83 gene promoter fragment for the DR4 construct
was obtained by PCR amplification with genomic DNA
template using the primers 5'-ATAGCGGCCGCTGTC
ATTACTAGAGTTTAAGTTATAACAATTGTAT-3' and
5'-ACGCTGCAGATCTGGAAATACAATAGGAAAAAT
AAAGTTAGCGAATT-3', then cloned into pGEM-T
(Promega).
The
Chhsp83
promoter
fragment
was
excised and ligated with pBS-FL1 that had been
digested with NotI and PstI, essentially replacing the
tetO-Dmhsp70 enhancer-promoter with the Chhsp83
promoter. The Chhsp83-tTAv-SV40 gene cassette was
then
excised
and
ligated
with
the
pB
[Lchsp83-
ZsGreen] transformation vector.
Genomic DNA isolation and inverse PCR
Five to 6 frozen adults were ground to powder with a
mortar and pestle under liquid nitrogen. Powder was
dissolved in 4 mL fresh STE buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl,
pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, pH 8). Two
hundred μL 10 % SDS and 8 μL RNase A (Cat#
R4642-250MG
Sigma
Aldrich
St.
Louis,
Missouri)
were added and samples were incubated at 56 °C. After
30 min, Proteinase K (Cat# P2308-100MG Sigma Aldrich)
was added to 100 μg/mL and the sample was incubated
overnight at 56 °C. Three mL phenol:chloroform:isoamyl
alcohol [25:24:1] (Cat#P2069, Sigma) was added and sam-
ples were rotated 10 min at 12 RPM at 22 °C. Samples
were then centrifuged 10 min at 1000 g at 4 °C. The aque-
ous layer was transferred to a new tube and the extraction
was repeated. One tenth volume 3 M sodium acetate,
pH 5.2 and 2 volumes cold 100 % ethanol were added and
mixed. The samples were incubated at -20 °C for 1 h and
centrifuged 30 min at 7200 g at 4 °C. The supernatant was
removed from the pellet, which was washed with 1 mL
cold 75 % ethanol. The pellet was air-dried 10 min before
resuspension in 50–100 μL TE Buffer. To determine gen-
omic sequence flanking the transgene insertion, inverse
PCR was performed with MboI, TaqαI, and MspI-digested
genomic DNA templates as described previously [48, 71].
RT-PCR and qRT-PCR
RT-PCR was performed with cDNA template from total
RNA isolated from larvae as described previously [72].
The pdgf-b primer pair used were PDGF-F (5-' ATG
AAG TCG TTC TTG TTG GTG TTG TTC GCC TTC
TTG GCC GTT-3') and PDGF-R (5'- CCG GAG TTT
AAA CCC TAG GCG CGC CAT GAG CTC AAG CTT
TCA TTA-3'). For RNA isolation for quantitative RT-P
CR (qRT-PCR), 5-6 frozen larvae were homogenized in
500 μL of Trizol (Cat#15596026 Life Technologies/
Thermo Fisher Scientific Waltham, Massachusetts) in a
1 mL glass homogenizer that had been previously baked
at 200 °C overnight. 100 μL of chloroform was added,
and samples were shaken for 15 s and allowed to incu-
bate at 22 °C for 15 min. Samples were centrifuged at
18,000 g for 15 min at 4 °C. The aqueous layer was
mixed with an equal volume cold RNase-free 70 % etha-
nol, mixed, and loaded on a Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit
column (Cat#74104 Qiagen Venlo, Netherlands). The
purification was performed according to the kit protocol,
including the optional on-column DNase digest using
the RNase-free DNase set (Cat#79254 Qiagen). A subse-
quent in-solution DNase digest was performed to elim-
inate residual DNA, followed by a second round of
column purification. cDNA was synthesized from 3.5 μg
of DNase treated RNA using Superscript III (Cat#18080-
400 Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's instructions.
Random hexamers were used as primers. Negative

 control reactions containing water instead of enzyme
mix were performed to confirm the absence of DNA
contamination.
PDGF qPCR primers were designed using Primer3:
hPDGF F (5'- GAAATTGTGCGTAAAAAGCCCATTT-3')
and hPDGF R (5'- AACAGTTTCACATTTACAGGCC
AAA-3'). Primers were tested for efficiency by creating
a dilution series of cDNA. Template was pipetted into
quadruplicate
wells
of
a
384
well
optical
plate
(Cat#4309849 Applied Biosystems). Thermo Maxima
SYBR Green/ Rox qPCR Master Mix 2X (Cat#K0221
Thermo
Fisher
Scientific
Waltham,
Massachusetts)
was added to primers to create a master mix, which
was dispensed into wells via a multi-channel pipet.
The plate was sealed (Cat#4311971 Applied Biosys-
tems), mixed, then centrifuged 1 min at RT at 1600 g.
The qPCR run was performed on a BioRad CFX384
C1000 Touch Thermocycler (BioRad Hercules, CA)
using the following program: 95 °C 10 min, [95 °C 15 s,
60 °C 60 s, 40x]. Data acquisition was performed on the
anneal/ extension step. Primer efficiency was determined
by plotting the log of the starting template dilution
on the X-axis and the mean Cq of the quadruplicate
replicates on the Y-axis. The slope of the best fit line
was used in the following equation to calculate effi-
ciency: [Efficiency = -1 + 10(-1/slope)]. Primers were ac-
cepted if efficiency was 90–105 % and re-designed if
efficiency fell outside this range.
For measurement of relative transcript levels, cDNA
templates were diluted 1:4 with nuclease-free water then
pipetted into quadruplicate wells of a 384 well optical
plate for each primer set, hPDGF and the 28 s rRNA ref-
erence gene. The 28S rRNA primer pair were Lc-28SF
(5'-ACCACTGTTCACACGAAACCCTTC-3') and Lc-28
SR
(5'-ATCTCGGTTGGATTTTAAACTTTGAAA-3').
The qPCR protocol was performed as above. Analysis of
delta delta Cq was performed using BioRad CFX
Manager. Mean Cq value was found for each set of 4
replicate wells. The reference gene was utilized to cal-
culate ΔCq. The EF-PDGF control was chosen as the
calibrator sample and set to 1. The bar graph repre-
sents
ΔΔCq
(relative
normalized
expression),
with
error bars representing standard error of the mean
for the replicate values.
Protein analysis
With the PD1 line (Lchsp24-pdgfb), prior to hemolymph
collection, adult flies were heat shocked at 37 °C for 2 h
with access to water and allowed to recover at room
temperature for 3 h. Flies were anesthetized by exposure
to carbon dioxide and then one wing was removed. The
hemolymph was squeezed into a capillary tube pre-filled
with a small amount of cold hemolymph collection
buffer (10 mM EDTA pH7 in 1X phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) + 1X Protease inhibitor cocktail (Cat# P2714,
Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) on ice. Samples were cen-
trifuged 2 min at 10,000 g at 4 °C. Supernatant was trans-
ferred to a new tube. Multiple adults were pooled for one
sample. Samples were stored at -80 °C.
For offspring of the cross between DR4 driver and EF-
PDGF effector, third instar larvae were sorted by fluores-
cence and rinsed with water on a vacuum funnel with
gentle suction. Larvae were briefly placed on a Kim
Wipe to remove excess moisture before being placed in
Eppendorf tubes and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. For
ES collection, larvae were processed as above and then
placed into wells of a 12-well flat-bottomed polystyrene
tissue culture plate. Six or 50 larvae were added per well.
Two hundred μL (for 6 larvae) or 1 mL (for 50 larvae) of
ES collection buffer (Ringer Solution [0.120 mM NaCl,
1.5 mM CaCl2, 5 mM KCl, pH 7.4, filter sterilized] + 1X
Protease inhibitor cocktail) was added per well, and
wells were sealed with an adhesive plate sealer. After
40 min, ES was removed and centrifuged at 21,000 g for
30 min at 4 °C. Supernatant was transferred to a new
tube and stored at -80 °C, and debris pellet was dis-
carded. Frozen larvae were lysed on ice in cold gentle
lysis buffer [73] using 1 mL glass homogenizers. Fol-
lowing homogenization, lysates were centrifuged at
15,000 g 15 min at 4 °C. Supernatant was transferred
to a new tube and stored at -80 °C, while debris pel-
let was discarded.
Total protein concentration was determined for lysates
and hemolymph using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit
(Cat#23227, Thermo Fisher, Rockford, IL) and for ES
using Quickstart Bradford 1X Dye Reagent and Quick-
start Bovine Gamma Globulin Standard (Cat# 500-0205
and 500-0208, BioRad, Hercules, CA). The hPDGF-BB
Quantikine ELISA kit was purchased from R&D Systems
(Cat# DBB00) and assay was performed according to kit
protocol. Lysate and ES samples were assayed in tripli-
cate wells, containing 150 μg and 15–60 μg protein per
well respectively. Eighty μg of total protein from each
hemolymph sample was assayed per well. Recombinant
His-tagged human PDGF-BB (Cat# ab73231, Abcam,
Cambridge, MA) was assayed on each ELISA run and
provided a positive, in-range control for the integrity of
the kit. Sample concentrations were extrapolated or in-
terpolated from a standard curve constructed from the
log PDGF-BB concentration (pg/L) on the X-axis and
the log mean optical density reading (OD) on the Y-axis.
Error bars represent standard error of the mean for the
replicate values.
