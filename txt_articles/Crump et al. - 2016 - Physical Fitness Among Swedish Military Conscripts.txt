Abstract
Background—Early-life physical fitness rarely has been examined in relation to type 2 diabetes 
mellitus (T2DM) in adulthood, because of the lengthy follow-up required. Elucidation of 
modifiable risk factors at young ages may help facilitate earlier and more effective interventions.
Objective—We examined aerobic capacity and muscular strength at age 18 in relation to T2DM 
risk in adulthood.
Design—National cohort study.

 Setting—Sweden.
Participants—All 1,534,425 military conscripts during 1969-1997 (97-98% of all 18-year-old 
males nationwide) without prior T2DM.
Measurements—Aerobic capacity and muscular strength measured in Watts and Newtons per 
kg of body weight, respectively, were examined in relation to T2DM identified from outpatient 
and inpatient diagnoses during 1987-2012 (maximum age 62 years).
Results—34,008 men were diagnosed with T2DM in 39.4 million person-years of follow-up. 
Low aerobic capacity and low muscular strength were independently associated with increased 
risk of T2DM. Comparing lowest vs. highest tertiles of both aerobic capacity and muscular 
strength, the absolute difference in cumulative incidence of T2DM was 0.22% at 20 years of 
follow-up (95% CI, 0.20-0.25), 0.76% at 30 years (0.71-0.81), and 3.97% at 40 years (3.87-4.06). 
Overall, the combination of low aerobic capacity and low muscular strength was associated with a 
3-fold risk of T2DM (adjusted hazard ratio, 3.07; 95% CI, 2.88-3.27; P<0.001), with a positive 
additive interaction (P<0.001). These associations were observed even among men with normal 
BMI.
Limitations—This cohort did not include women or physical fitness measurements at older ages.
Conclusions—In this large cohort of Swedish male military conscripts, low aerobic capacity 
and low muscular strength at age 18 were associated with increased long-term risk of T2DM, even 
among those with normal BMI.
Primary funding source—NIH.
INTRODUCTION
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) affects more than 300 million people worldwide and has 
more than doubled in prevalence over the past 3 decades, concurrently with increasing rates 
of obesity and sedentary lifestyle (1). US economic costs of T2DM and its complications 
exceed $200 billion annually (2). Although physical inactivity is a well-established risk 
factor, few studies have examined objective measurements of physical fitness in relation to 
T2DM. Physical fitness (which includes both aerobic capacity and muscular strength) may 
be a more informative risk factor, because it can be measured more objectively and is a 
better indicator of habitual physical activity than self-reported activity (3). Most studies of 
physical fitness have examined aerobic but not muscular fitness, and have focused on adults 
but lacked data at younger ages with sufficient follow-up to examine the long-term risk of 
T2DM. As a result, the relative effects of aerobic capacity and muscular strength, and their 
effects at younger ages on long-term T2DM risk, are still unknown. Elucidation of these risk 
factors at young ages may help facilitate earlier and more effective preventive interventions.
We analyzed data from a national cohort of military conscripts to examine aerobic capacity 
and muscular strength at age 18 years in relation to T2DM risk in adulthood. Aerobic 
capacity and muscular strength were assessed using standardized tests in ~1.5 million male 
military conscripts in Sweden who were followed up to a maximum age of 62 years. Our 
aims were to examine whether low aerobic capacity and low muscular strength at age 18 are 
associated with long-term risk of T2DM in this cohort.

 METHODS
Study Population
We identified 1,547,478 men (age 18 years) who underwent a military conscription 
examination in Sweden during 1969-1997. This examination was compulsory for all 18-
year-old men nationally each year except for 2-3% who either were incarcerated or had 
severe chronic medical conditions or disabilities documented by a physician. We excluded 
all 13,053 (0.8%) men who had a prior inpatient or outpatient diagnosis of diabetes. A total 
of 1,534,425 (99.2% of the original cohort) remained for inclusion in the study.
Physical Fitness Ascertainment
Aerobic capacity and muscular strength measurements were obtained using the Swedish 
Military Conscription Registry, which contains information from a 2-day standardized 
physical and psychological examination required for all conscripts starting in 1969. Aerobic 
capacity was measured as the maximal aerobic workload in Watts, using a standard well-
validated electrically-braked stationary bicycle ergometer test, as previously described (4). 
Maximal aerobic workload is highly correlated with maximal oxygen uptake (VO2 max; 
correlation ~0.9) (5), and its measurement using this bicycle ergometer test is highly 
reproducible, with a test-retest correlation of 0.95 (6). Muscular strength was measured as 
the weighted sum of maximal knee extension (weighted × 1.3), elbow flexion (weighted × 
0.8), and hand grip (weighted × 1.7), each measured in Newtons, using standard well-
validated isometric dynamometer tests (7). Each dynamometer test was performed three 
times and the maximum value recorded for analysis, except when the last value was highest, 
in which case testing was repeated until strength values stopped increasing. All testing 
equipment was calibrated daily (7). In the present study, aerobic capacity and muscular 
strength were standardized per kg of body weight, and were examined alternatively as 
continuous linear variables, categorical variables in tertiles (aerobic capacity in Watts per kg 
of body weight: low [<3.58], medium [3.58-4.18], high [≥4.18]; muscular strength in 
Newtons per kg of body weight: low [<28.23], medium [28.23-32.13], high [≥32.13]), and 
using cubic spline curves.
T2DM Ascertainment
The study cohort was followed up for T2DM from the time of the military conscription 
examination through December 31, 2012. T2DM was identified using International 
Classification of Diseases (ICD) diagnosis codes in the Swedish Hospital and Outpatient 
Registries. The Swedish Hospital Registry contains all primary and secondary hospital 
discharge diagnoses from six populous counties in southern Sweden starting in 1964, and 
with nationwide coverage starting in 1987; and the Swedish Outpatient Registry contains 
outpatient diagnoses nationwide starting in 2001. Diagnoses in the Hospital Registry are 
currently >99% complete and have a reported positive predictive value of 85-95% (8). 
Because earlier ICD versions did not distinguish between type 1 and type 2 diabetes, we 
ascertained T2DM using ICD-9 code 250 (excluding codes 250.X1 and 250.X3) during 
1987-1996, and ICD-10 code E11 during 1997-2012. A sensitivity analysis was performed 
which further included all diabetes diagnoses during 1969-1986 using ICD-8 code 250 from 
hospital discharge records (before outpatient data were available). Among men without

 T2DM diagnoses during 1987-2012, 542 were diagnosed with diabetes during 1969-1986, of 
which the majority would be expected to be type 2 (e.g., among men with the same age 
distribution, 75% of inpatient diabetes diagnoses during 1987-2012 were type 2).
Adjustment Variables
Other variables that may be associated with T2DM were obtained from the Swedish Military 
Conscription Registry and national census data, which were linked using an anonymous 
personal identification number. The following were used as adjustment variables: year of the 
military conscription examination (modeled simultaneously as a continuous and categorical 
[1969-1979, 1980-1989, 1990-1997] variable); body mass index (BMI = [weight in kg]/
[height in m]2; modeled simultaneously as a continuous and categorical variable using 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] definitions for children and adolescents 
aged 2 to 19 years: “overweight or obesity” is defined as ≥85th percentile on the CDC's 2000 
sex-specific BMI-for-age growth charts, which corresponds to BMI ≥25.6 for 18-year-old 
males (9)); family history of diabetes in a parent or sibling (yes or no, identified from 
diagnoses in the Swedish Hospital Registry during 1964-2012 and the Swedish Outpatient 
Registry during 2001-2012, not self-reported, thus enabling unbiased ascertainment); highest 
education level attained during the study period (<12, 12-14, ≥15 years); and neighborhood 
socioeconomic status at baseline (SES, included because neighborhood SES characteristics 
have been associated with T2DM (10, 11) and with physical activity and BMI (12); 
comprised of an index that includes low education level, low income, unemployment, and 
social welfare receipt, as previously described (13), and categorized as low [<−1 SD from 
the mean], medium [≥−1 SD and ≤1 SD], or high [>1 SD]). As alternatives to BMI, we also 
examined height and weight in a separate model, which were modeled simultaneously as 
continuous and categorical (height: <175, 175-184, ≥185 cm; weight: <60, 60-79, ≥80 kg) 
variables (9).
Missing data for each variable were imputed using a standard multiple imputation procedure 
based on the variable's relationship with all other covariates (14). Missing data were 
relatively infrequent for aerobic capacity (5.7%), muscular strength (5.0%), height (7.2%), 
weight (7.3%), education level (0.4%), and neighborhood SES (9.1%). As an alternative to 
multiple imputation, sensitivity analyses were performed after restricting to individuals with 
complete data for all variables (N=1,361,083; 88.0%).
Statistical Analysis
Absolute time-to-event measures were calculated using the cumulative incidence function 
for T2DM. Covariate-standardized cumulative incidence curves for T2DM were generated 
using the method of Simon and Makuch (15). We also used Cox proportional hazards 
regression to estimate the relative hazard of T2DM for different levels of aerobic capacity 
and muscular strength. The Cox model time scale was elapsed time since the military 
conscription examination (which also corresponds to attained age because baseline age was 
the same [18 years] for all conscripts). Individuals were censored at emigration (n=112,158; 
7.3%) or death (n=58,835; 3.8%). The proportional hazards assumption was evaluated by 
graphical assessment of log-log plots and was met in all models. Interactions between 
aerobic capacity and muscular strength were examined on either the additive or

 multiplicative scale. Additive interactions were assessed using the “relative excess risk due 
to interaction” (RERI), which is computed for binary variables as: RERIHR = HR11 – HR10 
– HR01 + 1 (16, 17). Multiplicative interactions were assessed using the ratio of HRs: HR11 / 
(HR10 HR01). We also examined interactions graphically using cubic spline curves.
Sensitivity analyses were performed that included only men with at least 30 years of follow-
up (N=686,964; 44.8%), or that evaluated the effect of unmeasured confounders (e.g., 
smoking) using external adjustment (18). In the analysis of smoking, we performed 10,000 
model simulations assuming two uniform independent distributions for smoking prevalences 
among exposed and unexposed between 0.2 and 0.4 (19), and a lognormal distribution for 
the smoking-T2DM relative hazard that implies a mean relative hazard of 1.5 and SD of 0.4 
(20). All statistical tests were 2-sided and used an α-level of 0.05. All analyses were 
conducted using Stata version 13.0 (21).

RESULTS
Among the 1,534,425 men in this cohort, 34,008 (2.2%) were subsequently diagnosed with 
T2DM in 39.4 million person-years of follow-up (mean follow-up, 25.7 years). The median 
age at the end of follow-up was 46.1 years (mean 45.9, SD 8.9, range 19.0 to 62.0), and at 
T2DM diagnosis was 46.8 years (mean 44.7, SD 9.9, range 18.0 to 62.0). Table 1 shows 
aerobic capacity, muscular strength, and other characteristics among 18-year-old men who 
did or did not subsequently develop T2DM.
Table 2 shows the covariate-standardized cumulative incidence of T2DM at 10, 20, 30, and 
40 years of follow-up by aerobic capacity and muscular strength at age 18. Low aerobic 
capacity was associated with significantly increased cumulative incidence at each of these 
follow-up times, irrespective of muscular strength level. Low muscular strength was 
associated with increased cumulative incidence after 40 years of follow-up among men with 
low or medium (but not high) aerobic capacity. The combination of low aerobic capacity and 
low muscular strength was associated with highest cumulative incidence, which reached 
4.45% at 40 years of follow-up (risk difference relative to high aerobic capacity and high 
muscular strength, 3.97%; 95% CI, 3.87-4.06; P<0.001). Cumulative incidence curves for 
T2DM by aerobic capacity and muscular strength are shown in Figure 1.
Table 3 summarizes the adjusted relative hazards of T2DM across the entire follow-up 
period by aerobic capacity and muscular strength at age 18. Low aerobic capacity and low 
muscular strength were independently associated with higher risk of T2DM, although low 
aerobic capacity was the stronger risk factor (Pheterogeneity<0.001). The combination of low 
aerobic capacity and low muscular strength was associated with highest T2DM risk (HR,

 3.07; 95% CI, 2.88-3.27; P<0.001). Comparing lowest vs. highest tertiles, aerobic capacity 
and muscular strength had a positive interaction on the additive (Pinteraction<0.001) but not 
multiplicative (Pinteraction=0.62) scale. The same additive interaction was found when 
examined at 30 or 40 years of follow-up (Pinteraction<0.001), but not at earlier times 
(Pinteraction>0.05).
The univariate effects of aerobic capacity, muscular strength, BMI, and other variables in 
association with T2DM are shown in Supplemental Table 1. In secondary analyses, we 
found positive additive (but not multiplicative) interactions between either low aerobic 
capacity or low muscular strength and high BMI in relation to T2DM (P<0.001; 
Supplemental Tables 2 and 3). Low aerobic capacity and low muscular strength were 
associated with higher risk of T2DM even among men with normal BMI. In sensitivity 
analyses that included diabetes diagnoses from 1969-1986 (for which type 1 and type 2 
could not be distinguished), that were restricted to men with no missing data, or that 
included only men with at least 30 years of follow-up, all risk estimates were very similar to 
the main results (data not shown). External adjustment for smoking yielded risk estimates 
for association between low aerobic capacity or low muscular strength and T2DM that were 
9% lower and remained highly significant (P<0.001), suggesting that unmeasured 
confounding had little influence on our main findings.
DISCUSSION
In this large national cohort study, low aerobic capacity and low muscular strength in 18-
year-old men were associated with higher risk of developing T2DM in adulthood, 
independent of BMI, family history, or socioeconomic factors. A combination of low aerobic 
capacity and low muscular strength was associated with highest risk, although aerobic 
capacity had the stronger influence. Furthermore, both of these factors were associated with 
increased risk of T2DM even among men with normal BMI. Positive additive interactions 
were found between low aerobic capacity and low muscular strength, suggesting that, if the 
associations are causal, interventions to improve aerobic capacity would have the greatest 
public health impact on T2DM among men with low muscular strength.
Most previous studies have examined physical fitness only in adulthood (22-30). The largest 
of these was a US study of 46,979 middle-aged adults with median follow-up of 5 years, 
which reported that higher physical fitness based on a treadmill stress test was independently 
protective against diabetes (Ptrend<0.001) (27). Fewer studies have examined physical fitness 
early in life, and none examined physical fitness in adolescence in relation to the long-term 
risk of T2DM. Our findings suggest that low aerobic capacity at age 18 is strongly 
associated with higher risk of developing T2DM later in life, irrespective of baseline 
muscular strength or BMI, after follow-up to a maximum age of 62 years.
We also found that low muscular strength was an independent risk factor for T2DM later in 
life, although was less influential than aerobic capacity. These findings are broadly 
consistent with previously reported associations between muscular strength among adults 
and reduced risk of metabolic syndrome (31, 32), between resistance training among adults 
and reduced risk of T2DM (33, 34), and between resistance training and improved glycemic

 control among adults with T2DM (35). The overall evidence to date suggests that high 
muscular strength or resistance training improves glycemic control and is protective against 
T2DM, independent of aerobic capacity. However, the combination of high muscular 
strength and high aerobic capacity is associated with the greatest protective benefit (33, 34).
Obesity is a well-established strong risk factor for T2DM (36-38). Importantly, we found 
that low aerobic capacity and low muscular strength were long-term risk factors for T2DM 
even among men with normal BMI. Other cohort studies have reported that low aerobic 
capacity is associated with T2DM even among non-obese adults, without examining 
muscular strength (22, 27, 30). Overall, these findings suggest that physical fitness has 
important health benefits for all, even those who are not overweight or obese.
There are several mechanisms by which aerobic and muscular fitness may enhance glycemic 
control (39, 40). Aerobic exercise is known to increase mitochrondrial density and oxidative 
enzyme activity, which promotes fatty acid oxidation and insulin sensitivity (41). Strength 
training augments type II muscle fiber growth, increasing glucose use capacity (41), and 
may up-regulate proteins in the insulin-signaling cascade, increasing insulin activity and 
further enhancing glucose utilization (42). Both aerobic exercise and strength training help 
reduce adiposity, a known risk factor for T2DM (43).
Strengths of the present study include its large national cohort design with prospective 
ascertainment of aerobic capacity, muscular strength, BMI, and T2DM. The national cohort 
design prevented selection bias, and the use of registry data with prospectively measured 
exposures prevented bias that may result from self-reporting. We examined objective, well-
validated measures of aerobic capacity and muscular strength, which are likely better 
indicators of habitual physical activity than self-reported activity (3). We were able to adjust 
for other strong risk factors for T2DM, including BMI, family history, and socioeconomic 
factors, which also were prospectively ascertained and not self-reported.
Limitations include the measurement of physical fitness and BMI at only one age (18 years), 
and hence we were unable to examine changes in these factors over time. Because this study 
was based on Swedish military conscripts, the cohort consisted entirely of men. Other 
studies have reported similar associations between low physical fitness and risk of T2DM 
among women (22, 29). Outpatient diagnoses in the present study were available only 
starting in 2001, and hence T2DM prior to this period was underreported. This 
underreporting is expected to be non-differential with respect to physical fitness and 
therefore to influence results toward the null hypothesis. In addition, diagnoses prior to 1987 
were excluded from the main analyses because they did not distinguish between type 1 and 
type 2 diabetes. However, sensitivity analyses that included all diabetes diagnoses prior to 
1987 (of which most are expected to be type 2) yielded very similar results as our main 
findings. Last, this was a relatively young cohort in Sweden. Additional studies will be 
needed in other populations, diverse ethnic groups, and with follow-up to older ages.
In summary, we found that low aerobic capacity and low muscular strength at age 18 were 
independently associated with higher risk of developing T2DM in adulthood, among men 
with either normal or high BMI. These findings suggest that interventions to improve

 aerobic and muscular fitness early in life could help reduce T2DM risk in adulthood. 
Additional studies with longitudinal measurements of fitness will be needed to delineate the 
most important windows of susceptibility and further inform preventive interventions.
