 A biomarker is a “defined characteristic that is measured 
as an indicator of normal biological processes, patho­
genic processes or responses to an exposure or interven­
tion, including therapeutic interventions” (REFS 1,2). The 
current FDA–NIH Biomarker Working Group definition 
— adopted in this consensus statement — states expli­
citly that “molecular, histologic, radiographic or physio­
logic characteristics are examples of bio 
markers” (REF. 2).

ogy, because some previous definitions have restricted

Abstract | Imaging biomarkers (IBs) are integral to the routine management of patients with 
cancer. IBs used daily in oncology include clinical TNM stage, objective response and left 
ventricular ejection fraction. Other CT, MRI, PET and ultrasonography biomarkers are used 
extensively in cancer research and drug development. New IBs need to be established either as 
useful tools for testing research hypotheses in clinical trials and research studies, or as clinical 
decision-making tools for use in healthcare, by crossing ‘translational gaps’ through validation 
and qualification. Important differences exist between IBs and biospecimen-derived biomarkers 
and, therefore, the development of IBs requires a tailored ‘roadmap’. Recognizing this need, 
Cancer Research UK (CRUK) and the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of 
Cancer (EORTC) assembled experts to review, debate and summarize the challenges of IB 
validation and qualification. This consensus group has produced 14 key recommendations for 
accelerating the clinical translation of IBs, which highlight the role of parallel (rather than 
sequential) tracks of technical (assay) validation, biological/clinical validation and assessment  
of cost-effectiveness; the need for IB standardization and accreditation systems; the need to 
continually revisit IB precision; an alternative framework for biological/clinical validation of IBs; 
and the essential requirements for multicentre studies to qualify IBs for clinical use.

 the scope of biomarkers to describing biological mol­
ecules. Such narrow definitions regard values obtained 
from imaging and other techniques as measurements of 
an underlying biomarker, rather than being biomarkers 
themselves. However, the current FDA–NIH definition 
takes a broader view. Earlier definitions also stated that 
biomarkers should have ‘putative’ diagnostic or prog­
nostic use3, although this requirement is no longer 
specified by FDA/NIH. Biomarkers must be measured, 
but can be numerical (quantitative) or categorical (either 
a quanti 
tative value or qualitative data; for definitions, 
see Supplementary information S1 (table)).
The use of both imaging biomarkers (IBs) and bio­
specimen­derived biomarkers is widespread in oncology. 
In healthcare settings, biomarker uses include screen­
ing for disease; diagnosing and staging cancer; targeting 
surgical and radiotherapy treatments; guiding patient 
stratification; and predicting and monitoring therapeutic 
efficacy, and/or toxicity4. In research, biomarkers guide 
the development of investigational drugs as they progress 
along the pharmacological audit trail5, in which they can 
indicate the presence of drug targets, target inhibition, 
biochemical pathway modulation or pathophysiologi­
cal alteration by investigational drugs; drug therapeutic 
efficacy in specific groups of patients; and tracking of 
drug resistance6. The use of biomarkers has led to the 
identification of potentially successful drugs early in the 
developmental pipeline, thereby accelerating market 
approval for some therapies and enabling drug develop­
ers to reduce overall costs by identifying  
ineffective or 
toxic compounds at the earliest opportunity5.
Despite some biomarkers being used extensively and 
others showing great potential7,8, a surprisingly limited 
number of biomarkers guide clinical decisions9–11. Some 
putative cancer biomarkers are not adopted because they 
do not measure a relevant biological feature nor enable 
disease diagnosis or outcome prediction. In such cases, 
the biomarker is appropriately devalidated12. Many other 
promising biomarkers, however, are neither devalidated 
nor qualified for use in research or healthcare settings 
and, instead, are confined in the academic literature 
without real application owing to a lack of efficient and 
effective strategies for biomarker translation13.
All biomarkers, including IBs, must cross two ‘trans­
lational gaps’ before they can be used to guide clinical 
decisions14,15 (FIG. 1). Biomarkers that can reliably be used 
to test medical hypotheses cross the first gap becoming 
useful ‘medical research tools’; if the biomarker crosses 
the second gap then it becomes a ‘clinical decision­ 
making tool’
. Some biomarkers that have only crossed 
the first translational gap are nevertheless highly useful 
in the development of therapies5,13.
Several publications have described strategies for 
developing and evaluating cancer biomarkers, focusing 
mainly on biospecimen­derived biomarkers — that is, 
those derived from patient tissue or biofluids4,16–21. The 
processes of initial discovery, validation and qualification 
share many similarities for IBs and biospecimen­derived 
biomarkers; however, substantial inherent differences 
exist between both biomarker types (Supplementary 
information S2 (table)). The FDA and NIH have rec­
ognized this distinction and have outlined specific 
 
recommendations for image acquisition and analysis in 
IB development22,23. Questions of how IB acquisition and 
analysis should be standardized, and how terminology 
should be harmonized have been addressed by numer­
ous academic, clinical, industrial and regulatory groups.

lighted the need for a detailed validation and qualifica­
tion roadmap to improve IB translation38,39. Recognizing 
this need, representatives from CRUK and the EORTC, 
together with other assembled experts in radiology, 
 
cancer imaging sciences, oncology, biomarker develop­
ment, biostatistics and health economics, have formu­
lated an Imaging Biomarker Roadmap for Cancer Studies 
(FIG. 2). In this Consensus Statement, we outline this 
roadmap and identify specific considerations for IB vali­
dation and qualification, providing illustrative examples 
of IBs in various stages of development. From this frame­
work, we provide 14 recommendations to accelerate the 
successful clinical translation of effective IBs, as well as 
the devalidation40,41 of IBs that lack utility.
Current uses of imaging biomarkers
An IB is a measurement derived from one or more medi­
cal images. Many IBs are used routinely in healthcare 
(TABLE 1). IBs provide readily available, cost­effective, 
non­invasive tools for screening, detecting tumours and 
serial monitoring of patients, including assessments of 
response to therapy and identification of therapeutic com­
plications. IBs can enable tracking of a particular tumour 
repeatedly over time, can map the spatial hetero 
geneity 
within tumours, and can evaluate multiple different 
lesions independently within an individual.
Applications for IBs include the American College of 
Radiology Breast Imaging­Reporting and Data System 
(ACR BI­RADS) mammographic breast morph 
ology42; 
clinical tumour, node, metastasis (TNM) stage43 (BOX 1); 
objective response as defined in RECIST version 1.0 
(REF. 44) or 1.1 (REF. 45) criteria (BOX 2); bone mineral 
 
density T­score measured by dual energy X­ray absorp­
tiometry46; and left ventricular ejection fraction47 
(LVEF;  BOX 3). These IBs underpin patient care world­
wide, although they are subject to continuing research 
to improve their performance. In addition, IBs could 
achieve companion diagnostic status, as seen with the 
IB [99mTc]­etarfolatide folate receptor positivity48 (FR+; 
BOX 4), demonstrating that imaging can be necessary to 
guide the choice of therapy for individual patients.
IBs frequently add value in cancer research (TABLE 1). 
The use of IBs can enable the measurement of patient 
response to treatment before a survival benefit is 
observed, which can subsequently lead to early regulatory 
approval of new drugs49 (BOX 2). IBs can indicate the pres­
ence of drug targets and target inhibition, for example by 
proving receptor occupancy50 (Supplementary informa­
tion S3 (box)). IBs have the unique potential to provide 
serial non­invasive mapping of tumour status during 
treatment. For example, absolute values of 18F­FDG­
PET maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) at 
baseline, or changes in this value observed early during 
 
treatment have been used for proof­of­mechanism and 
proof­of­principle51 in drug development (BOX 5), or 
to demonstrate nonspecific responses to treatment52 
(BOX 5). Dynamic contrast­enhanced (DCE) CT or 
MRI­derived Ktrans (REF. 53) (BOX 6) and dynamic contrast­ 
enhanced ultrasonography area under the curve (AUC) 
values (Supplementary information S4 (box)) have 
been used as IBs of pharmacodynamic (PD) changes 
and response to treatment54. The use of IBs has led to 
improved margins of  
radiotherapy dose delivery55 (BOX 5)
and surgical margins56.
Many more IBs used to measure tumour anatomy, 
morphology, pathophysiology, metabolism or molec­
ular profiles are being developed in order to study the 
hallmarks of cancer57. Between 2004–2014, approxi­
mately 10,000 studies reported new or established IBs 
(Supplementary information S5 (box)), including IBs 
derived from new modalities (such as photoacoustic 
imaging58) and new techniques (such as MRI dynamic 
nuclear polarization59; Supplementary information S6 
(box)), and new analytical approaches (such as radiomic 
profiling of tumours to extract multiple features60,61; 
Supplementary information S7 (box)), contributing to 
this ever­increasing number of IBs.
IBs have four key attributes. First, they are a subset 
of all biomarkers. Second, they can be quantitative or 
qualitative. Quantitative IBs (measured on an interval 
or ratio scale28) are used in patient care, but other meas­
urements that fall outside this definition (for example, 
the ACR BI­RADS category, clinical TNM stage, or 
objective response) are categorical measurements and 
are also important IBs. In this Consensus Statement, 
we have deliberately included all image measurements 
(quantitative or categorical) that satisfy the definition

 ADC
Apparent diffusion co‑efficient 
is a commonly used imaging 
biomarker in studies of various 
therapies, including cytotoxic 
chemotherapy, targeted agents 
and radiotherapy. The 
biomarker is sensitive to 
motion of water molecules.
of an IB, according to the current FDA–NIH Biomarker 
Working Group definition2. Third, IBs are derived 
from imaging modalities, techniques or signals, but 
are distinct entities; for example, the change in median 
apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) is a biomarker, 
and is distinct from the modality (MRI), the technique 
(diffusion­weighted imaging) or the measured sig­
nal (free induction decay) required to generate the IB 
(Supplementary information S8 (figure)). Fourth, one 
imaging measurement can support multiple distinct IBs. 
For example, 18F­FDG­PET has improved disease sta­
ging in patients with non­small­cell lung cancer, lymph­
oma or melanoma by facilitating the identification of 
nodal and distant metastases62. In this case, the IB is 
clinical TNM stage, which is defined using CT and PET 
data rather than using CT data alone (BOX 1). Similarly, 
systems such as PERCIST (for all solid tumours)63 
and the Deauville five point system (for lymphoma)64 
aim to improve the assessment of response criteria by 
incorporating PET data, but produce an ordered cat­
egorical IB — namely objective response (BOX 2). This 
approach is conceptually different from quantifying 
absolute values of 18F­FDG­PET data to derive putative 
cut­off points subsequently used to identify patients 
with poor prognosis65 or evidence of specific pathway 
modulation in a clinical trial of an investigational new 
drug66,67 (BOX 5).
Many quantitative image measurements comprise 
continuous data, which must then be categorized to facil­
itate clinical decision­making. Clinicians often decide 
between two or more alternative treatment options for 
each patient, informed by whether a biomarker value 
is above or below a cut­off point. For example, cancer 
therapy­related cardiac dysfunction has been defined 
as LVEF reduction of ≥10 percentage points to a value 
below normal (53% for adults; BOX 3). Clear guidelines 
detailing how scintigraphy or 2D echocardiography 
should be performed have been established for this IB 
of toxicity for use in healthcare47. In distinction, other 
healthcare­related IBs (such as clinical TNM stage and 
objective response) are measured as ordered categorical 
variables. In this case, the boundary between several cat­
egories is defined by cut­off points; alternatively, catego­
ries can be combined to create a single cut­off point (for 
example, to select, continue or stop therapy).
In research applications, data are often interpreted 
as a continuous rather than used in a categorized way. 
For example, in early phase trials, continuous vari­
able PD biomarkers (including percentage change in 
tumour size68, 18F­FDG­PET SUVmax (REF. 52),ultra­
sonography AUC69 and MRI median Ktrans (REF. 53) or 
ADC70 (BOXES 5,6; Supplementary information S6 (box)) 
can indicate antitumour activity of therapeutic agents 
used at different doses and time points. These studies 
have led to the demonstration of proof­of­concept and 
proof­of­mechanism, the definition of pharmacokinetic 
(PK)–PD relationships and informed on dose selection 
for novel therapeutic approaches53.
Specific considerations for IBs
IBs and biospecimen­derived biomarkers differ in sev­
eral important aspects, limiting the relevance to IBs of 
previous roadmaps (designed for biospecimen­ 
derived 
biomarkers13,71; Supplementary information S2 (table)). 
The performance of imaging devices of different makes 
and models installed in different clinical centres can 
vary considerably. These devices are designed, approved, 
maintained, and operated to provide images38 that 
diagnostic radiologists, nuclear medicine physicians 
and other clinicians interpret, often with little need to 
quantify the data obtained. Innovation is largely driven 
by competition to improve image quality and the user 
interface; vendors and purchasers often have only sec­
ondary interest in how improvements in image quality 
will affect quantification or standardization of IBs. The 
measurement of many IBs requires the administration 
of tracers or contrast agents (for example, diagnostic 
drugs, usually investigational or off­label), the devel­
opment and availability of which are uncertain. Many 
steps in IB validation require a new prospective clinical 
trial; whenever investigational tracers or contrast agents 
are involved, the high burden of regulation can cause 
 
significant delays in this process.
Many IBs do not purport, even in principle, to 
measure any underlying analyte, making traditional 
approaches to assay validation seen with biospecimen­ 
derived biomarkers problematic. For example, dilution 
linearity and reagent stability — important performance 
characteristics for biospecimen­derived biomarker 
assessment12 — cannot be assessed for biomarkers based 
on analysing medical images, such as texture­based IBs. 
The measurement validity of such IBs depends substan­
tially on events that occur while the patient is coupled 
to the imaging device. Thus, the role of central reading 
laboratories in data processing is minor in comparison 
with biospecimen­derived biomarkers4.
The imaging biomarker roadmap
Biomarkers cross the two translational gaps by passing 
through a series of domains (discovery, or domain 1; 
validation, or domain 2; and qualification with ongoing 
technical validation, or domain 3) that address different 
research questions. This process follows two parallel and 
complementary tracks: in one track, technical (assay) 
performance is examined by addressing whether the 
biomarker is measurable precisely and accurately, and 
Figure 2 | The imaging biomarker roadmap. A detailed schematic roadmap is depicted. 
The imaging biomarker (IB) roadmap differs from those described for biospecimen- 
derived biomarkers. For imaging, the technical and biological/clinical validation occur  
in parallel rather than sequentially. Of note, essential technical validation occurs late in the 
roadmap in many cases (such as full multicentre and multivendor reproducibility). Definitive 
clinical validation studies (IB measured against outcome) are deferred until technical 
validation is adequate for large trials. In the absence of definitive outcome studies, early 
biological validation can rely on a platform of very diverse graded evidence linking the  
IB to the underlying pathophysiology. Cost-effectiveness impacts on the roadmap at  
every stage, owing to the equipment and personnel costs of performing imaging studies. 
Technical validation and cost-effectiveness are important for IBs after crossing the 
translational gaps because hardware and software updates occur frequently. Therefore, 
technical performance and economic viability must be re-evaluated continuously. SOP

 whether it is widely available in all geographical terri­
tories. In the other track, biological and clinical per­
formances are examined by addressing whether the 
biomarker can be used to measure a relevant aspect of 
biology or predict clinical outcome. In reality, no bio­
marker is perfectly validated. Instead, strategies must 
be defined to identify, mitigate and quantify the uncer­
tainty, risk and cost associated with any given biomarker 
in making research or clinical decisions72–74. The nature 
of these activities and the sequence in which they are 
combined constitutes a ‘biomarker roadmap’
.
In biospecimen­derived biomarker roadmaps, tech­
nical (assay) validation commonly occurs early in order 
to produce a ‘locked­down biomarker’ — that is, the data 
acquisition and analysis pathways used to measure the 
biomarker are fixed. In many cases, this stage is followed 
rapidly by biological and clinical validation because the 
locked­down biomarker enables widespread evaluation 
across multiple sites4,18. For IBs, several key aspects of 
technical validation (such as multicentre reproducibil­
ity) must be addressed at a relatively late stage, unlike 
biospecimen­derived biomarkers. Studies might address 
both technical and biological validation concurrently, 
but progress down each track might be quite independ­
ent. As evidence for validation accumulates, a third track 
of cost­effectiveness must be considered, because IBs 
must not only demonstrate an association with health 
benefits, but also demonstrate ‘value for money’ when 
compared with the use of clinical information alone or 
with alternative biofluid­based in vitro diagnostics75.
Imaging biomarker discovery — domain 1
Most biospecimen­derived biomarkers are molecular 
features found in the genome, transcriptome, proteome 
or metabolome that can be chosen rationally to address 
unmet needs in cancer medicine. This selection approach

 Double baseline studies
Biomarker precision can be 
assessed by measuring on 
multiple occasions and 
calculating the repeatability 
or reproducibility of the 
parameter. T
ypically, this 
precision is achieved by 
measuring the biomarker twice 
at baseline in the absence of 
any treatment effects.
has also inspired the rational design of several novel 
targeted nuclear medicine or optical imaging tracers76. 
Many of the most valuable IBs, however, have had a con­
voluted genesis through unanticipated discoveries in the 
physical sciences (chemistry, computing, engineering, 
mathematics or physics) being matched to unmet medical 
needs after initial discovery, and then developed further.
Technical validation — domains 2 and 3
Complete technical validation is achieved when an IB 
measurement can be performed in any geographical 
location, whenever needed, and give comparable data. 
Technical validation does not address whether the IB 
measures underlying biology, or relates to clinical out­
come and/or utility, but it can have a major influence on 
subsequent attempts at qualification because IBs with lim­
ited availability or poor reproducibility cannot sensibly 
undergo further clinical evaluation in large multicentre 
trials.
Precision. Repeatability and reproducibility are related 
measures of assay precision. Repeatability refers to meas­
urements performed multiple times in the same subject 
 
(in vitro and/or in vivo) using the same equipment, soft­
ware and operators over a short timeframe, whereas 
reproducibility refers to measurements performed using 
different equipment, different software or operators, 
or at different sites and times77, either in the same or in 
 
different subjects.
Different intended applications require different 
 
levels of evidence for precision3. For example, single­ 
centre repeatability might be sufficient to validate a PD or 
monitoring IB in an early phase clinical trial restricted to 
that site53. Conversely, screening, diagnostic, prognostic 
and predictive IBs with putative use in whole populations 
require evidence of reproducibility across multiple expert 
and non­expert centres before they can be considered 
technically valid. Such multicentre validation requires 
complex and costly studies13.
Repeatability analysis should be performed early in IB 
development. Repeatability estimated from studies using 
rodents can seem unfavourable because, in some models, 
tumours can grow considerably within a few hours78, but 
useful data can be gained in slow­growing rodent models. 
Definitive repeatability analysis is best assessed in studies 
with humans, and should be performed at each centre 
that evaluates the IB anew, because reliance on historical 
or literature values is a source of error. Test performance 
is known to vary between sites, and is influenced by 
 
scanner performance, and organ site studied (for example, 
precision is better in brain lesions79 compared with liver 
or bowel lesions80–82). Physiological variations between 
individuals (depending on factors such as caffeine, 
 
nico 
tine, alcohol or concomitant medication) can also 
alter IB values83.
Multicentre studies involve different research insti­
tutions that usually utilize devices supplied by different 
vendors. These devices are broadly equivalent for clinical 
radiology purposes, although they often have important 
hidden differences that affect IB acquisition and analysis 
(Supplementary information S2 (table)). These factors do 
not preclude multicentre technical assessment of IB pre­
cision, but values might not be as reproducible as those 
derived in few­centre or single­centre studies84 (BOX 6; 
Supplementary information S4 (box)).
Unfortunately, despite the scientific benefits associ­
ated with double baseline studies, the time and financial 
cost of performing such studies often deters investigators 
and funders from incorporating repeatability or repro­
ducibility evaluations into study protocols. For example, 
between 2002–2012, only 12 of 86 phase I/II studies of 
antivascular agents that incorporated DCE­MRI bio­
markers, such as the volume transfer co­efficient Ktrans, 
measured test–retest performance53 (BOX 6). Multisite 
reproducibility studies of IBs are very rare.
Bias. Technical bias describes the systematic difference 
between measurements of a parameter and its real value85. 
Few in­human IB studies report bias because real values 
might not be possible to ascertain in a clinical setting. 
For some IBs, bias can be estimated by comparison with 
reference phantoms, as is the case when validating bio­
markers on the basis of CT Hounsfield units86, and MRI 
longitudinal (R1) and transverse (R2) relaxation rates87. 
Imaging phantoms, however, seldom fully represent 
technical performance in animals or humans. For other 
IBs, such as the effective transverse relaxation rate (R2*), 
diffusion anisotropy, or Ktrans (all measurable by MRI), 
appropriate calibration phantoms are not available or 
poorly represent living tissue.
Box 1 | Clinical TNM stage – prognostic and predictive IB 
Staging systems record the presence, size and number of lesions at tumour, nodal and 
other metastatic sites to derive an ordered categorical biomarker of patient disease 
burden. The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Cancer Staging Manual43 
provides detailed radiology reporting guidelines, enabling measurements to be robustly 
reproduced. For solid tumours, tumour, node, metastasis (TNM) staging systems or 
equivalents derived from imaging modalities, including CT, MRI, single-photon emission 
computed tomography (SPECT; for example, 99mTc-bone scintigraphy) and PET (for 
example, 18F-FDG-PET), either alone, or supported by other biospecimen or clinical 
measurements are available (see figure below). TNM stage is prognostic in nearly all 
cancer types.
TNM is also predictive in some settings. In prostate cancer, clinical TNM stage 
distinguishes localized disease (T1–2 N0/Nx M0) from locally advanced disease (T3–4 
any N M0; or any T N+ M0). This imaging biomarker (IB) is prognostic because patients 
in the former group have worse outcomes than those in the latter group. The same IB, 
however, is predictive of benefit for bicalutamide monotherapy, because this treatment 
only benefited patients with locally advanced disease in a large randomized controlled 
trial, leading to approval of the drug in the UK146. This IB has crossed the two 
translational gaps in biomarker development and is used daily in clinical practice.

 Availability. IB assessments must be feasible, safe, and 
well­tolerated in the target population, and must have 
regulatory and ethical approval for use in humans. 
Differing regulatory approvals (for example, different 
gadolinium­based contrast agents have been approved 
by regulatory agencies in Europe, North America 
and Japan13) and commercial pressures (for example, 
ferucarbotran iron oxide nanoparticles are no longer 
commercially available in Europe or North America) 
can substantially affect availability. With regard to PET, 
some short half­life tracers (such as 15O­H2O) are highly 
informative, but require the presence of on­site cyclotron 
facilities, making worldwide translation impossible with 
currently available technologies, for economic reasons. 
Finally, specialist techniques in all modalities require 
advanced radiographer and technician support, which 
might not be available locally.
Biological/clinical validation — domain 2
The terms ‘biological validation’, ‘clinical validation’ 
and ‘clinical utility’ describe the stepwise linking of 
biomarkers to tumour biology, outcome variables and 
value in guiding decision­making, respectively. Clinical 
validation requires demonstration that the biomarker 
merely relates to a clinical variable and, therefore, is less 
difficult to establish than clinical utility (but also less 
meaningful)86. Clinical utility is achieved when the bio­
marker leads to net improvement of health outcomes 
or provides information useful for diagnosis, treatment, 
management, or prevention of a disease10,88.
The REMARK guidelines89 provide a framework 
for the assessment of clinical utility and validation. 
Typically, prospective testing of IBs in clinical popu­
lations is required in adequately powered studies with 
follow­up times of 3–5 years to provide outcome data 
associated with the IB. For example, in patients with 
colorectal cancer, parameters such as circumferential 
resection margin56, depth of tumour spread, and extra­
mural vascular invasion90, are assessed by MRI before 
surgery, have been validated as preoperative prognos­
tic and predictive IBs, and are currently used to stratify 
patients into treatment groups. Similarly, ongoing work 
is evaluating the role of tumour CT, MRI and PET ‘radi­
omic signatures’ (REF. 91) (Supplementary information S7 
(box)) or 18F­FDG SUVmax baseline values65 as prognostic 
IBs. In these examples, IB data are derived from routine 
clinical images, making the process of establishing clin­
ical utility much faster than is typically possible for IBs 
derived from techniques not yet established in routine 
healthcare61.
IBs that have demonstrated clinical validity can 
have important roles in drug development. For exam­
ple, RECIST 1.1­defined objective response is a widely 
used phase II clinical trial end point that has proved 
useful for preliminary screening of new therapeutic 
agents45. More­rigorous criteria must be met to validate 
an IB as a trial­level surrogate end point to completely 
replace a well­established clinical trial end point. The 
Prentice criteria92 describe idealized conditions for 
demonstration of surrogacy, which unfortunately are 
rarely achieved and would typically require extremely 
large datasets93. Approaches for surrogate validation 
more pragmatic than the Prentice criteria involve the 
application of meta­analysis methods to a collection of 
large or moderate­sized datasets that measure both the 
putative surrogate biomarker and the definitive clini­
cal end point94. These meta­analytic approaches often 
require some degree of IB standardization in order to 
combine datasets in a meaningful manner. Some IBs 
have been well­standardized (such as the RECIST 1.1 
objective response), whereas others (for example, DCE­
MRI­derived Ktrans53; BOX 6) have not. Large prospec­
tive multicentre studies relating IBs to an outcome can 
only be initiated when exhaustive technical validation 
has established multicentre IB precision and accuracy. 
Clinical utility (and sometimes, validation) necessar­
ily happens late in the IB roadmap; therefore, alter­
native validation strategies must be sought for many 
novel IBs. Biological validation can be approached 
Box 2 | Objective response – monitoring and response IB
Response criteria (such as complete response, partial response, stable disease or 
progressive disease) define the patient’s response to therapy as an ordered categorical 
measurement. Solid tumours are assessed by WHO147, RECIST 1.044 and 1.145 or similar 
criteria using imaging techniques alongside biospecimen-derived and clinical 
measurements (see figure below). Response criteria require a great level of detail  
and therefore, such measurements can be reproduced robustly.
Objective response has crossed the two translational gaps in biomarker 
development and is used daily in clinical practice, as well as by regulators to approve 
new drugs for full market approval and accelerated approval49. Several research 
studies have attempted to optimize the definition of objective response for specific 
tumour–therapy combinations. Examples include incorporating 18F-FDG-PET data into 
response assessment in lymphoma, measuring the peak of the standardized uptake 
value (SUVpeak) in PERCIST62 and the peak of the standardized uptake value (SUVmax)  
in the Deauville criteria63, or adapting thresholds required to define partial response 
and partial disease as described in the Choi criteria for assessing response of GIST  
to imatinib therapy148. In all of these cases, however, the biomarker remains the 
objective response.
When a new version of a biomarker is tested against an existing version (for 
example, PERCIST and RECIST 1.1 definitions of objective response), and if the 
possibility of comparing paired measurements from each patient (with established 
and fixed acquisition and analysis methods) exists, then assessment on whether the 
new method better predicts a relevant clinical end point (such as overall survival)  
can be carried out. However, information can also be derived from measuring 
concordance between the two methods on a per-case basis (with a weighted  
kappa statistic) because both methods might measure different aspects of tumour 
biology or have different error sources, but can have similar ability to predict a 
clinical end point.

 by accumulating a platform of evidence linking the 
IB to meaningful biological features, and response to 
therapies with well­studied mechanisms of action71. 
These  
principles — outlined by Bradford Hill93,95 
(Supplementary information S9 (box)) — establish 
evidence for IB performance on the basis of scientific 
coherence, specificity, strength of association, effect 
 
gradient, temporality and consistency.
If the Bradford Hill criteria are adopted, early preclin­
ical imaging–pathology correlation studies5,96 provide 
an important component of the platform of evidence 
because whole­tumour histopathology is rarely possible 
in patients. Studies conducted with animals enable clin­
ically relevant IBs to be related to fundamental bio 
logi­
cal processes that can only be measured with invasive 
techniques. For example, the relationship between DCE­
MRI­derived Ktrans and tumour blood flow rate (a fun­
damental measure of response to antivascular agents) 
was investigated using a terminal radiotracer­based 
technique in rat tumour models97. Preclinical studies 
also enable the examination of the therapeutic dose–
response relationship at different time points in a range 
of tumour models. Of note, however, pathophysiological 
assays are often considered as a ‘reference standard’
, but 
are also biomarkers and thus imperfect, and also subject 
to sampling bias. Thus, some ‘reference standard’ tests 
might not enable the prediction of survival, or relate 
to the intended biological process. Moreover, precise 
pathophysiological correlates of some IBs might not 
exist, or can be almost impossible to obtain13.
Evidence of imaging–biology correlations and early 
response to therapies can provide sufficient biological 
validation to establish IBs as useful for PD assessments 
or monitoring response in early phase clinical trials, even 
in the absence of compelling outcome data53. The IBs 
18F­FDG­PET SUVmax and Ktrans (BOXES 5,6) are illustra­
tive of how IBs can cross translational gap 1 to guide 
decision­making for subsequent studies. For example, 
the biologically active dose for the antivascular agent 
ZD6126 calculated according to Ktrans measurements98 
was shown to be greater than its maximum tolerated 
dose, effectively halting further clinical development of 
this agent. In other studies, Ktrans data informed of the 
biologically active dose for cediranib99 and the optimum 
scheduling for brivanib100 (BOX 6).
Cost-effectiveness — domains 2 and 3
To be translated into the clinic, IBs must provide 
good ‘value for money’ and compare favourably with 
biospecimen­ 
derived biomarkers resulting from technolo­
gies, such as ‘liquid biopsies’ of isolated circulating tumour 
cells or cell­free DNA. In the research setting, the value 
added by testing a key hypothesis (with an IB) should be 
greater than the cost of performing the study. In healthcare, 
the economic test is harsher, because even well­validated 
IBs will not cross translational gap 2 unless they offer 
an advantage in terms of cost per quality adjusted life 
year (QALY) gained13. Initially, translating IBs into the 
healthcare setting is costly and time­consuming101.
Studies in early stages of IB discovery and validation 
can access conventional biomedical research funding 
streams, whereas evidence­gathering studies to support 
IB qualification can be difficult to fund. For example, 
large­scale multicentre reproducibility studies can be 
unattractive to research funders if seen as ‘incremental’ 
and, unless such studies create exploitable intellectual 
property, they are not attractive to commercial spon­
sors. One approach to solve this problem is to assemble 
consortia of commercial and not­for­profit stakehold­
ers, such as the QuIC­ConCePT consortium13,31, QIBA28 
and QIN102, to undertake multicentre validation steps to 
meet the collective needs of the community.
Initial IB translation requires large­scale funding by 
government, charity or industry, or commercialization 
of the IB by an imaging company (for example, a major 
scanner manufacturer in the case of hyperpolarized 
13C­MRI/MRS), or by a start­up business focused on a 
specific technique or IB. This strategy requires careful 
assessment of the likely risk–benefit of the development 
process, and strong intellectual property positions to 
ensure likely financial return on the imaging device, 
agent or biomarker38. Complex economic considerations 
are related to IBs developed as companion diagnostics 
associated with a specific therapeutic. Such IBs might be 
Box 3 | Left ventricular ejection fraction – safety prognosis and monitoring IB
Many well-established (for example, radiotherapy, doxorubicin or trastuzumab) and 
recently introduced (for example, tyrosine kinase inhibitors) anticancer therapies are 
associated with a substantial risk of cardiotoxicity149. Reduced left ventricular ejection 
fraction (LVEF) is well-established in cardiovascular medicine as prognostic of cardiac 
outcomes, measured by various methods, such as transthoracic ultrasonography, 
scintigraphy and, in research studies, using MRI. Guidelines for the use of LVEF in the 
care of patients with cancer have been defined, with a consensus in defining cancer-
therapeutics-related cardiac dysfunction as a decrease in LVEF of >10%, confirmed 
with repeated imaging47.
This imaging biomarker (IB) has crossed the two translational gaps in biomarker 
development and is used widely in care of cancer patients; FDA-approved labels for 
therapies such as lapatinib, sunitinib, doxorubicin or trastuzumab150 all require 
measurement of LVEF.

 cost­effective for the healthcare payer (reducing futile 
expenditure and avoiding adverse effects in patients who 
cannot benefit from the drug) as well as beneficial for 
 
the supplier of the therapeutic (leading to a reduction 
in the size of trial cohorts, enabling marketing authoriz­
ation, and providing better ratios of costs per QALY 
gained), but are associated with increased risks for 
the IB developer because, if clinical translation of the 
 
therapy fails (such as in the case of vintafolide48; BOX 4), 
the market for the companion diagnostic disappears.
Qualification — domain 3
The term ‘qualification’ has different scientific and regu­
latory meanings. Generally, qualification is an evidentiary 
process of linking a biomarker with biological processes 
and clinical end points intended to establish that the bio­
marker is fit for a specific purpose96,103,104. For example, 
the use of IBs qualified as prognostic would enable the 
enrichment of a clinical trial population with patients 
at the highest risk of experiencing a clinical event, thus 
increasing the efficiency of the trial105. Such IBs have to 
be clinically validated to show their association with an 
outcome, but might not necessarily be associated with 
clinical utility for decision­making in healthcare. In dis­
tinction, the same IB could potentially be qualified for 
prediction of patient response (or lack of response) to a 
particular therapy based on evidence that the treatment 
effects in biomarker­positive patients differ from those in 
biomarker­negative patients (for example, superior out­
come with experimental therapy in biomarker­positive 
patients versus biomarker­negative patients)106. The IB 
might be used for enrichment or stratification of patient 
populations in clinical trials and, if the trial is successful, 
such IB could be further developed into a companion 
diagnostic with established clinical utility for identifying 
patients likely to benefit from the new therapy.
Qualification requires demonstration of fitness for a 
particular purpose and, therefore, an IB might need to 
be evaluated in several scenarios to justify a broad claim 
of qualification. Hence, the IB might become qualified 
for one particular use (such as for a cancer type or a 
 
certain drug class), but not for others. Nevertheless, 
when a biomarker is qualified in multiple settings (for 
example, different tumour types, different therapies or 
different research questions), then the process of quali­
fication for a new application can be expedited because 
most of the necessary validation requirements are likely 
to have been fulfilled107.
‘Regulatory qualification’ is a more­specific term that 
describes a framework for the evaluation and accept­
ance of a biomarker for specific use in regulatory deci­
sion­making108 (Supplementary information S1 (table)). 
Examples include new drug approvals or safety monitor­
ing. This framework for regulatory qualification is not 
a formal requirement for a drug developer who merely 
wishes to ‘qualify’ an IB to support a proof­of­mechanism 
or a dose­selection decision.
Roadmap application
With this Consensus Statement we aim to accelerate IB 
translation. For this purpose, we have produced 14 key 
recommendations (BOX 7), accompanied by a detailed 
imaging biomarker roadmap for cancer studies (FIG. 2). 
Together, the roadmap and recommendations provide a 
framework for understanding how to examine qualitative 
and quantitative IBs at all stages of their validation and 
qualification. Herein, we identify the key steps required 
to achieve these goals, recognizing the important differ­
ences between IBs and biospecimen­derived bio 
markers. 
No biomarker is expected to be perfect; instead, this 
roadmap provides a tool to assess the current evidence for 
technical and biological and/or clinical performance of 
any given IB at any stage of development. The limitations 
of each IB can be identified, quantified, documented and 
made publicly available. In the process of creating this 
roadmap, we have identified several  
potential obstacles 
in the clinical translation of putative IBs.
Key recommendations
Recommendations 1–2 — grant submissions and study 
publications. Proposals for funding to support IB­related 
studies should state clearly how these will advance IB 
vali 
dation or qualification. Resulting journal publications 
should state explicitly how these aims have been achieved 
(recommendation 1). Study design, protocols, quality 
assurance processes and standard operating procedures 
Box 4 | 99mTc-etarfolatide — companion diagnostic IB with regulatory approval
Nuclear medicine imaging biomarkers (IBs) can help to identify the presence or absence 
of a cancer phenotype, acting as binary categorical biomarkers, similarly to genomic 
identification of mutation status. For decades, 131I-radio-iodine scintigraphy has 
enabled the identification of local and distant disease in patients with thyroid cancer,  
as a subjective radiological assessment, rather than by deriving an IB151. Conversely, 
radiolabelled somatostatin receptor analogues are used in scintigraphy (for example, 
111In-pentetreotide octreotide)152 and in PET–CT (for example, 68Ga-dotatate)153 to 
identify neuroendocrine tumour sites; such IBs are categorical, defined by a maximum 
standardized uptake value (SUVmax) in the target lesion that exceeds the background 
SUVmax. If the scan is positive, the IB alters clinical management because ablative 
treatment is given (see figure below).
The European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the FDA have authorized new 
personalized medicines with a label mandating a blood-based, tissue-based, or 
imaging-based companion diagnostic. As an example of how IBs could be companion 
diagnostics in oncology, the EMA Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use 
recommended FR+ (folate receptor-positive status assessed using 99mTc-etarfolatide 
scintigraphy) for approval as a companion imaging diagnostic in patients with 
platinum-resistant ovarian cancer treated with vintafolide therapy. This 
recommendation was conditional on the outcome of the PROCEED trial of vintafolide, 
which reported negative results154,155. This case set an important regulatory precedent 
for an imaging-based companion diagnostic.
A patient with a metastatic neuroendocrine tumour undergoing a diagnostic 
68Ga-dotatate PET–CT has a | multiple disease sites on fused coronal images, and 
b | maximum intensity projection. The patient then received therapeutic 177Lu-dotatate, 
which enables demonstration of drug uptake at the disease sites, confirmed by SPECT–
CT examination on c | fused coronal images and d | maximum intensity projection.

 should be reported exhaustively by making full use of 
supplementary materials for research publications. 
The software used for image processing should also be 
reported and be made available once intellectual property 
rights have been addressed (recommendation 2). These 
two recommendations will result in the greatest possible 
confidence in the reported IB­related data, will facilitate 
the conduct of statistically valid meta­analysis studies 
of imaging data, and will help investigators, reviewers, 
target audiences, funders and governments evaluate the 
risks associated with each IB for any given research or 
healthcare application.
Recommendations 3–7 — technical (assay) validation. 
A compelling rationale supports the accreditation of 
clinical imaging laboratories as being competent for 
measuring a given IB (recommendation 3), in line 
with the standards set by the biospecimen­derived bio­
marker community4. This approach has been adopted 
by the PET community when performing quantita­
tive 18F­FDG­PET in clinical trials both in Europe and 
North America, focusing on performing regular equip­
ment calibration and quality assurance. Moreover, data 
acquisition, analysis and reporting standards have been 
adopted32. In Europe, this initiative has been driven by 
the EANM and endorsed by the EORTC to ensure that 
institutions involved in multicentre clinical trials adopt 
best­practice procedures, and that quantitative reporting 
is harmonized across sites to improve reproducibility. 
Participants receive certification to distinguish them 
from nonparticipating institutions. Similarly, standard­
ization of DCE­ultrasonography109 and LVEF measure­
ments47 have been addressed by expert consensus. In the 
USA, the NCI evaluates performance of dynamic and 
static PET, volumetric CT and DCE­MRI in partnership 
with the ACRIN29. All NCI­designated  
cancer centres 
have been certified for measurement value equiva­
lence, with ongoing annual inspection to provide regu­
lation39. This certification involves the incorporation 
of IBs in clinical trial design and requires evaluation of 
the performance of imaging sites by the NCI Clinical 
Trials Network26.
Site accreditation is an important step towards 
improving technical performance in multicentre studies, 
 
but must reflect widely sought academic consensus, 
become adopted by international societies, and receive 
the backing of funders, industry and regulators for such 
accreditation to have value. Accreditation must simul­
taneously promote standardization and harmonization 
of IBs for multicentre use, while accommodating studies 
led by investigators who have scientific freedom to fur­
ther develop and optimize IBs. To achieve this optimi­
zation, best­practice guidelines for each widely used IB 
(or related family of IBs) must be updated and reviewed 
regularly (recommendation 4), because biomarker drift 
is inevitable owing to technological advances in scanner 
performance (for example, clinical trials with ongoing 
data collection can be affected by hardware and soft­
ware upgrades). Suitable statistical methods, such as 
multivariate linear regression analysis and other more 
complex statistical approaches, must be used to adjust 
for changes in IBs during ongoing studies (for example, 
defining  pre­change and post­change data).
IB precision must be demonstrated early in IB develop­
ment through single­centre repeatability studies, or few­
site reproducibility studies (recommendation 5). This 
Box 5 | 18F-FDG-PET SUVmax — a monitoring, PD and radiotherapy planning IB
This imaging biomarker (IB) is distinct from the 
contribution of 18F-FDG-PET signals to define clinical  
TNM stage or objective response. 18F-FDG-PET SUVmax 
(maximum standardized uptake value) has crossed 
translational gap 1 in three distinct settings:
• 18F-FDG-PET signals map the spatial variation in glucose 
uptake, which is increased in tumours owing to their high 
rate of glycolysis32,35. Many therapies reduce glucose 
uptake, including established cytotoxic chemotherapy 
agents156 and antiangiogenic agents66,157; for such 
therapies, Δ18F-FDG-PET SUVmax is a nonspecific IB for 
monitoring treatment response.
• Conversely, over 20 studies of PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway 
inhibitors have used Δ18F-FDG-PET SUVmax as a 
pharmacodynamic (PD) IB to measure specific and very 
acute effects of target and pathway inhibition67,158,159. 
In these studies, Δ18F-FDG-PET SUVmax provides proof-of- 
mechanism in the pharmacological audit trail5 as a specific 
PD IB, because PI3K plays a central role in regulating cell 
functions, including metabolism, in conjunction with 
downstream kinases, such as AKT and mTOR160 (see 
opposite image).
• The spatial distribution of 18F-FDG-PET SUVmax can be 
mapped and used as an IB in radiotherapy treatment-
planning. A randomized phase II trial is comparing 
isotoxic dose-escalation and dose-boost to tumour 
regions with >50% of the SUVmax value55. If the results  
of this study are positive, it could support the use of 
functional imaging in radiotherapy planning and 
adaptive therapy during treatment.
Further standardization is necessary for the IB to cross 
translational gap 2. 
Clinical trial of the PI3K inhibitor pictilisib67 shows >30% 
reduction in the 18F-FDG-PET SUVmax in a patient with 
peri-hepatic disease from primary ovarian cancer before 
(left) and after (right) therapy. Adapted from Clin. Cancer 
Res., 2015, 21/1, Sarker, D. et al. First-in-human phase I

 assessment is particularly important when testing the 
ability of an IB to measure the effect of therapeutic inter­
vention. The choice of performance metric is important; 
for example, the coefficient of variation assumes that the 
standard deviation is approximately proportional to the 
mean. If studies of repeatability are performed under mul­
tiple conditions (such as imaging patients across different 
groups), then a plot of the standard deviation versus mean 
should be examined to determine whether this propor­
tionality is valid. In most imaging studies of repeatability, 
only two replicates are acquired for each patient and thus, 
a Bland Altman plot will enable the evaluation of whether 
or not the mean of the measurements influence on 
 
variance, providing overall limits of agreement110.
Once the IB is shown to have sufficient technical and 
biological validity to cross translational gap 2, multicentre 
reproducibility must be evaluated (recommendation 6). 
Some studies have measured IB multicentre reproducibil­
ity (for example, DCE­CT evaluation of ovarian cancer111), 
but these are rare exceptions. The recruitment of patients 
with cancer to attend for scanning on devices at multi­
ple centres is seldom possible and thus, studies usually 
require the use of data from different patients, scanned 
on different machines. Considerable centre­specific dif­
ferences might exist regarding devices, contrast agents and 
tracers, and software. This variability must be accounted 
for when considering multicentre reproducibility. Mixed­
effects modelling provides a statistically robust approach 
to maximising data inclusion, while acknowledging 
 
inevitable slight inconsistencies in the data112.
Data­analysis strategies must be developed for multi­
centre studies (recommendation 7). Analysis led by one 
central site can reduce data variation for studies with 
a moderate number of participating sites113,114. As IBs 
transition towards crossing gap 2, however, using one 
central site is inappropriate for IBs that will eventually 
be analysed at many cancer centres once the IB has 
been adopted in healthcare. To facilitate this transition, 
sites should compare their own technical performance 
against a central analysis, similarly to the assessment of 
objective responses in oncology trials.
Recommendations 8–11 — biological validation and 
clinical validation. Clinical validation occurs relatively 
late in the development process for most IBs compared 
with biospecimen­derived biomarkers71. Extensive 
preclinical studies can provide well­controlled data to 
examine the relationship of the IB to pathology, and 
the IB to the effects of interventions, and therefore are 
strongly encouraged (recommendation 8). The choice 
of experimental model is an important consideration. 
Tumour xenograft models in immunodeficient mice 
are well­studied and have reproducible growth charac­
teristics115, and can be ideal for initial IB development, 
but tumour models that better portray the relevant bio­
logical characteristics found in human cancers are also 
needed116,117. Firstly, in situ tumours, or those implanted 
into their orthotopic site often better recapitulate the 
local microenvironment of human tumours117,118. 
Secondly, syngeneic models, with intact immune sys­
tems, are essential for some studies (for example, for 
the evaluation of IBs for immunotherapies). Thirdly, 
appropriately genetically­engineered mouse models can 
have lesions that accurately mimic human tumours119, 
an approach that can facilitate co­clinical trials in which 
preclinical studies are run in parallel with clinical trials 
in order to identify likely responders to targeted ther­
apies118,120. Finally, models derived from patient tissue 
(PDX models)121 or circulating tumour cells (CDX 
 
models)122 offer potential insights into developing per­
sonalized therapeutic regimens123. The biological valida­
tion of IBs must incorporate the use of these models once 
 
proof­of­concept has been demonstrated in xenograft 
models. When possible, IBs should then be validated in 
clinical studies124, in order to confirm imaging–biology 
relationships in humans. Adaptive trial designs can be use­
ful for early stage IB studies125. Sample­size re­estimation 
 
can be performed in those studies in which limited 
 
relevant data inform on sample size126. Similarly, group­ 
sequential design127 can provide flexibility in the num­
ber of animals or patients entered into a study. Such 
approaches can ensure adequate power with small 
sample sizes — if effect sizes are suitably large — and, 
 
therefore, can make imaging studies more affordable128.
Box 6 | ΔKtrans and ΔIAUC60  — monitoring and PD IB
Ktrans is a composite measurement of blood flow and vessel permeability34, derived from 
MRI or CT data — with both modalities showing reasonable levels of agreement161,162.
Change in Ktrans from baseline (ΔKtrans) and similar metrics (such as ΔIAUC60  (integrated 
area under the curve at 60 seconds)) have been used in >100 early phase clinical trials 
and academic-led studies of antivascular agents to demonstrate proof-of-principle51,82, 
as well as to identify optimum drug doses and schedules53 (see figure below).
ΔKtrans has crossed translational gap 1 as part of the pharmacological audit trail5, and 
has assisted in the development of antiangiogenic drugs by helping to select doses for 
cediranib99 and other agents53, and determining the schedule for brivanib100. This IB has 
also contributed to the decision to halt further development of the antivascular agent 
ZD6126 by demonstrating that the biologically active dose was greater than doses that 
induced toxicity98.
At present, substantial interlaboratory variation in DCE–MRI acquisition and analysis 
mean that absolute values of Ktrans can vary by an order of magnitude across centres163. 
This limited technical validation has prevented IBs based on absolute values of these 
parameters from crossing the translational gaps to be used as prognostic IBs136.

bevacizumab. a | Double baseline scanning enables calculation of IB precision; here,

 Improved methods for imaging–biology correlation 
are needed for IB biological validation (recommenda­
tion 9), because currently available methods often fail to 
account for extensive spatial heterogeneity in the IB129 and 
in the tissue pathology118, and for the difference in scale 
of the two measurements. Moderate­level concordance 
between imaging data (slice or volume) and pathology 
(single section) provide only limited biological valida­
tion. Instead, 3D comparisons are strongly encouraged, 
to better co­localise imaging and pathology data and 
reduce sampling bias. In some studies, genomic, tran­
scriptomic and proteomic biomarkers, or biofluid­derived 
biomarkers, including circulating tumour cells, might be 
more­appropriate validation tools than tissue­derived 
Box 7 | Recommendations for imaging biomarker validation and qualification in cancer studies
Grant submissions and study publications
1. Applicants should explain how proposed studies aim to advance imaging 
biomarker (IB) validation or qualification. Publications should state 
whether and how the study has advanced IB validation or qualification.
Rationale. Many IB studies fail to address urgent unmet needs, making 
over-optimistic assumptions about data robustness and how results 
might be generalized, and therefore, they fail to have scientific impact.
2. Publications describing IB development or application should report 
study design, protocols, detailed quality assurance processes and 
standard operating procedures exhaustively, making full use of 
supplementary data.
Rationale. Fine technical details of image acquisition and analysis, 
although uninteresting to most readers, have large effects on IB reliability 
and confound meta-analyses. Rigorous reporting guidelines for 
established biospecimen-derived biomarker studies4 provide a useful 
template. Many prestigious journals now support and encourage 
extensive addition of supplementary material.
Technical (assay) validation
3. Clinical laboratories and imaging centres should be accredited for IB 
acquisition and analysis. Academic, clinical, industry and regulatory 
partners must work across each jurisdiction to develop, maintain and 
regulate the necessary framework to achieve this accreditation.
Rationale. Good-quality IB studies are difficult to perform. Accreditation 
is a vital step in biospecimen-derived biomarker validation4,17 and similar 
steps are required for IBs.
4. The imaging community (academics, clinicians and industry) must 
develop, advocate, and continuously revise strict best-practice guidelines 
for acquisition and analysis of IBs.
Rationale. Editors, referees and readers should be able to evaluate 
whether a study of an IB is compliant with best-practice, or whether 
investigators have adequately justified any noncompliance with 
guidelines (for example, rational use of novel image analysis).
5. Single-centre studies should measure IB repeatability, unless compelling 
reasons exist not to. All therapeutic-intervention studies should report 
double-baseline repeatability or reproducibility measurements.
Rationale. IB repeatability and reproducibility data used for power 
calculations must be taken from the centres that will perform the 
subsequent pharmacodynamic, screening, diagnostic or outcome studies. 
High-quality repeatability data has beneficial ethical, economic and 
logistical effects, by reducing sample size, trial duration and trial cost.
6. Multicentre reproducibility across multiple different equipment vendors 
must be demonstrated in relevant patient populations before phase II or 
phase III studies are initiated.
Rationale. Results of small-sized outcome studies might not be 
generalizable to large-sized patient populations examined on a greater 
variety of devices by staff in non-expert centres.
7. Multicentre studies require a documented lead analysis site to initiate 
and monitor IB-data quality. Analysis should be performed at one centre 
(if involving a few sites), or by comparing individual centres to a central 
read (if involving a large number of sites and if the IB is near to crossing 
translational gap 2).
Rationale. Variation in IB acquisition and analysis must be minimalized for 
multicentre studies to optimize likelihood of a validated IB being 
qualified as fit-for-purpose for clinical use.
Biological and clinical validation
8. Definitive outcome studies happen late in the IB validation journey. Initial 
biological validation should be based on graded accumulation of diverse 
evidence95, including early robust imaging–pathology correlations 
through comprehensive series of studies with patients and relevant animal 
models (including genetically engineered mouse models, syngeneic 
models and orthotopic and/or in‑situ tumours).
Rationale. Biospecimen-derived biomarkers can often be evaluated 
rapidly against survival rates using biobanked samples. This possibility is 
uncommon for IBs, unless the IB is derived from images acquired routinely 
in healthcare.
9. Improved capabilities should be developed for accurate imaging–
pathology correlation, including whole-tumour 3D analysis and 
alternative ‘gold standards’, such as biospecimen-derived readouts.
Rationale. Many IBs have not influenced clinical decision-making because 
of unclear relationships with tumour biology. Traditional pathology analysis 
of one or few tissue sections might result in under-sampling of tumours.
10. Multicentre, collaborative and federated efforts are urgently needed 
to share, store and curate data.
Rationale. Most IB validation necessarily involves new data acquisition. 
Few centres can recruit enough patients in sufficient time to power 
large-sized prospective imaging-based studies. Initiatives such as 
RIDER102, led by the US National Cancer Institute, illustrate possible 
solutions to these problems. Furthermore, image repositories enable 
rapid evaluation of IBs derived from existing data.
11. All true-negative, false-negative and false-positive data obtained in 
studies with either animals or humans should be published.
Rationale. Reluctance to publish negative findings results in considerable 
publication bias and risks overstating the degree of IB validation.
Qualification
12. Definitive studies linking IB to clinical outcomes must be prospective, 
in relevant patient populations, and adequately powered. Novel study 
designs are encouraged.
Rationale. Many IB studies are underpowered for sensitivity, specificity 
and survival data. Study populations should not be dominated by highly 
selected patients who are more able to undergo thorough complex 
imaging protocols than the general patient population.
Cost-effectiveness
13. New models for funding and regulation should be developed for 
investigational devices and tracers and/or contrast agents that lack 
commercial viability as diagnostic products in healthcare systems, but 
have value in the research setting as IBs.
Rationale. Research related to many valuable IBs involves specialized 
devices, tracers and contrast agents that are not commercially viable as 
diagnostic products. Regulatory hurdles are rightly much higher for 
marketing approval than for investigational use; however, precedent set 
by the PET community has maintained availability of many investigational 
tracers for research use even with limited or no marketing prospects.
14. Outcome studies should include health economic considerations. 
Comparisons of cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) should be 
performed between imaging and competitor biospecimen-based 
biomarkers.
Rationale. IBs are perceived to be costly; thus, a clear QALY advantage 
should be demonstrated.

 measurements91,130. The use of appropriate statistical 
methods is required to define associations between 
imaging and pathology measurements. Spearman’s rho or 
Kendall’s tau rank correlation coefficients enable the com­
parison of IB values to reference standard pathology read­
outs within a cohort; however, if these two measurements 
(or transformations of these variables, such as logarithms) 
relate linearly to one another, regression models provide 
estimates of biases and the scale of the relationship.
IB studies often generate rich datasets that can be col­
lected and banked for future re­use. These data include 
raw images, processed images and parameter maps, 
ancillary files (such as regions of interest, mask files, 
and stored header information detailing scan parameter 
settings), and essential patient metadata covering demo­
graphics, treatment history and clinical outcome (such 
as response, progression­free survival and/or overall 
survival). Useful data­archiving systems require finan­
cial support; collaboration between multiple academic, 
industry and funding partners; and ongoing curation 
and active management — as exemplified by the NCI 
Informatics Technology for Cancer Research platform131. 
Technological advances (such as cloud­based solutions) 
must be accompanied by suitable information govern­
ance arrangements, potentially crossing international 
legal and regulatory frameworks102, and by commitment 
from funders to resource these initiatives.
Creation of animal and human cancer image reposito­
ries, following the lead of organizations including the NCI 
and the ESR132, is strongly encouraged (recommendation 
10) to enable rapid testing of new analyses by researchers 
from different institutions. In some cases, this approach 
can even lead to a reduction in the number of animal 
experiments (in line with the 3Rs of animal welfare in 
 
cancer research116) or in the number of new patients 
recruited. Standardized data collection, analysis and 
archiving are required to support multisite clinical trials102.
Complete and transparent study reporting is essen­
tial to avoid selective reporting bias and publication bias 
(recommendation 11). Results of all prespecified analyses 
(secondary analyses as well as primary analyses) should 
be reported, regardless of whether they are consistent 
with expectations, or whether they achieve statistical sig­
nificance133,134. Highlighted exploratory analyses (either 
prespecified or post hoc) should be accompanied by a 
description of all other exploratory analyses performed. 
This strategy will more­accurately reflect the potential 
for false­positive and false­negative findings. Adherence 
to these principles of reporting will help to eliminate the 
distortion of research findings resulting from selective 
reporting and failure to publish negative studies. These 
biases can also be reduced by registering studies and 
detailing their hypotheses on publically available websites 
(such as ClinicalTrials.gov) before the study is initiated or 
before outcome data are unblinded89,135.
Recommendation 12 — qualification. Robust study 
design and predefined statistical analysis plans are vital to 
ensuring that the highest quality evidence is available 
to qualify IBs. Late­stage multicentre clinical trials should 
be powered adequately to demonstrate clinically useful 
effects. At present, few IBs are rigorously validated or 
qualified as prognostic for quality of life, progression­free 
survival or overall survival136. Appropriate statistical 
methods (for example, control of the false­discovery rate 
and cross­validation techniques137) are needed to avoid 
spurious findings and overfitting caused by measurement 
of large numbers of image parameters relative to numbers 
of patients — a common problem in several published 
biospecimen­based biomarker studies138. Efficient study 
designs should be pursued, for example, in studies of diag­
nostic accuracy135 or test impact, in which each patient is 
regarded as his or her own control; examples include add­
ing functional imaging to standard anatomical radiology 
in order to improve diagnosis139,140. In later­stage clinical 
trials, several treatments can be tested concurrently in the 
same trial using enrichment or predictive IBs, as is the 
case of current molecular profiling­based studies141. This 
measure can increase recruitment efficiency, reduce costs, 
and accelerate achievement of primary end points142.
Qualification requires rigorous and detailed statistical 
reporting standards. Screening and diagnostic accuracy 
IB studies should report sensitivity and specificity, results 
of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, 
and negative and/or positive predictive values135, whereas 
prognostic and predictive IB studies should report esti­
mated effect sizes, such as hazard ratios89. Estimates 
should be accompanied by measures of uncertainty (for 
example, 95% confidence intervals) as well as statistical 
significance. In studies in which predictive biomarkers 
 
are evaluated using randomized controlled trials, 
CONSORT guidelines should be followed143.
Recommendations 13–14 — cost-effectiveness. New 
models for funding and regulation should be developed 
for investigational devices, tracers and contrast agents, 
and software that have value as IBs in the research set­
ting, but lack commercial viability as a diagnostic prod­
uct in healthcare systems (recommendation 13). Imaging 
 
studies are perceived to be expensive and thus, integra­
tion of investigational IBs should be linked to exist­
ing radiological tests (addition of the IB to a clinically 
approved ultrasonography, CT or MRI examination, for 
example) whenever possible. Large­scale studies should 
include health­economic considerations, including meas­
uring the cost­effectiveness of IBs versus competitor 
tests (other IBs or  
biospecimen­derived biomarkers)144 
( 
recommendation 14).
Conclusions
Clinical imaging has transformed contemporary medi­
cine145. IBs have enormous potential to facilitate further 
advances in cancer research and oncology practice by 
accurately informing clinical decision­making, but must 
undergo rigorous scrutiny through validation and quali­
fication to achieve this end13. This process of evaluation 
enables investigators and consumers to make informed 
decisions about IB translation for each research and 
healthcare application10. The roadmap and recommen­
dations that we present herein will, if adopted, mark 
a change in the development and use of IBs in cancer 
research and patient management.
