COPD is a highly debilitating disease that represents a substantial and growing health burden in
women. There is increasing evidence for sex-related differences in COPD risk, progression, and
outcomes. However, the disease receives scant attention as a women’s health issue. Thus, a
multifaceted approach is required to address COPD in women, including greater awareness,
minimization of risk, and further elucidation of the sex-specific factors (biological and cultural)
that affect risk, disease progression, and treatment success. This article reviews the current
literature on the topic and provides suggestions for achieving better outcomes for the millions of
women with COPD worldwide.

KEY WORDS: COPD; lung function; sex
COPD receives scant attention as a women’s
health issue, despite the fact that women are
more likely to die of COPD than of breast
and lung cancer combined.1 The perception
that COPD is a disease of older, male
smokers is outdated; COPD affects both men
and women globally and is particularly
prevalent in low- and middle-income
countries.2 Indeed, the prevalence of COPD
globally is increasing more rapidly in women
than in men, and the number of female
COPD-related deaths now surpasses the
number in men in some countries.2-8
Furthermore, although globally, women are
on average expected to live approximately
4.5 years longer than men, the impact of
COPD on life expectancy in women may be
greater. In addition, mortality rates in
women with COPD are not falling as rapidly
as in men.9,10
There is an urgent need to recognize the
increasing burden of COPD in women and
therefore to facilitate improvements in
disease management. Although sex-specific
data in COPD studies are scarce, a pattern of
relevant sex-specific characteristics is
emerging (Fig 1) that warrants awareness
and consideration.11 A multifaceted
approach is needed, with sustained effort, to
achieve the following: reduce the prevalence
of COPD by mitigating risk; improve timely
diagnosis rates in women by raising
awareness of COPD; and improve the
management of COPD in women through
further sex-specific research and better

 consideration of sex-relevant factors, such as common
comorbidities. The goal of the present article was to
review key data and provide suggestions for achieving
these goals.
Search Strategy and Selection Criteria
A PubMed literature search (January 1995-onward) and
a search of congress abstracts (2012-January 2015) was
performed by using various combinations of the terms
“chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,” “COPD,”
“emphysema,” “bronchitis,” “women,” and “female”; this
search was followed by a manual screening, based on
expert opinion, of the results for articles of interest. In
addition, we reviewed relevant COPD guidelines and
cross-referenced articles of relevance identified by the
original search criteria. More than 3,000 publications
were retrieved and manually screened for articles of
interest.
Risk of Developing COPD in Women
Individual risk for developing COPD is based on both
personal susceptibility and environmental risk factors.
Although not fully understood, there is indirect
evidence suggesting that for a given level of risk
exposure, women are more susceptible to developing
COPD or have more rapid disease progression than
men.4,12-19 A study by Sørheim et al14 found that
women were disproportionately represented in the
subset of patients with COPD with severe disease
despite minimal tobacco smoke exposure (defined as
< 20 pack-years). Women were also more likely to
present with COPD before 60 years of age. Similarly,
findings from two Danish longitudinal population studies
(combined N ¼ 13,897) found that, after adjusting for
smoking, women had a greater risk of COPD-related
hospitalization compared with men (Fig 2).16 It is not
clear whether these differences in susceptibility are due
to differences in genetic predisposition, physical
differences (eg, airway and lung size), hormonal
influences, or secondhand risk exposure. A recent study

 by Hardin et al15 suggests that there may be variations
between different subgroups of female patients that
influence susceptibility to parenchymal destruction;
however, more research is needed to fully elucidate
these and other findings.
Exposure to modifiable risk factors varies significantly
according to sex and location, reflecting the social and
cultural diversity of different regions. Although it is well
established overall that tobacco smoking is the leading
cause of COPD in both men and women, the
contribution of other factors (eg, occupational and
biomass smoke exposure) is important and should be
recognized in any initiatives aimed at combating the
disease.8 An awareness of risk factors other than primary
smoking may be of particular relevance to women, who
comprise the majority of patients with COPD who have
never smoked.8,20
Smoking
It is estimated that, worldwide, the proportion of female
subjects in the overall smoking population will rise from
approximately 12% in the first decade of this century to
20% by 2025.21 A striking increase in female smoking
prevalence is particularly apparent in some low- and
middle-income regions.6,22,23 However, the prevalence
of smoking among women varies dramatically by
country, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status.20 In a
number of countries (particularly high-income
countries), smoking prevalence in women has plateaued
or decreased.24 Despite this finding, a possible lag time
between smoking and onset of COPD means that, even
in countries in which COPD has plateaued/decreased in
women, the historic trend toward increasing tobacco
smoking by women may be reflected in a high COPD
burden for some time to come.25
Reasons for smoking may differ between the sexes;
female empowerment through tobacco smoking
(a phenomenon widely and skillfully promoted by
tobacco companies for a number of decades) and weight
control are likely to be two reasons for smoking that
are more weighted to female subjects than to male
subjects.21,24,26 In addition, once a smoking habit is
established, some evidence suggests that cessation efforts
are less successful in women than in men; various
contributory factors for this scenario have been suggested
that require further study.27 For example, a large,
national community study in Canada indicated that
women with COPD who smoke have higher rates of
nicotine addiction than their male counterparts.27
Although primary smoke exposure is often a focus for
prevention campaigns, secondhand smoke exposure
may also be a particular concern for women who
represent the majority of never-smokers with COPD.20
Biomass Fuel Exposure
Worldwide, approximately 50% of households and
90% of rural households use biomass fuels as their main
source of domestic energy.20 As a result, approximately 3
billion people are exposed to smoke from biomass fuel,
with women being affected more than men, primarily
due to the greater involvement of female subjects in
cooking and domestic responsibilities.20,28-30 Policies
that enable households to move away from a
dependence on traditional biomass fuel may help reduce
exposure, but in areas where this approach is not
possible (ie, where there is no option other than to use
cheap fuel), public health initiatives are needed to
facilitate the use of flued stoves/chimneys or improved
ventilation (eg, through improved house design).
Interventions should be of sufficient quality to make the
air clean.29
In addition, educational initiatives (particularly for
women) highlighting the risks of exposure to indoor air
pollution may be useful. It is important to note that
COPD in lifelong nonsmokers has also been observed to
be sex-specific in developed economies. For example, in
the Canadian Cohort Obstructive Lung Disease
(CanCOLD) study, exposure to passive smoke and
biomass fuel for heating, even in a developed country
such as Canada, were independent risk factors for
COPD in women.31 Reportedly, women exposed to
biomass fuels have clinical characteristics and prognosis
similar to that of smokers; there are data to suggest,
however, that an airway-predominant phenotype may be
more common than an emphysema phenotype.30,32-35
Occupational Exposure
The role of the workplace in COPD causation is often
underrecognized.36 In women, several different
occupational factors may warrant particular
consideration in efforts to reduce COPD risk exposure,
especially in various cottage industries in low- and
middle-income countries. Cottage industries comprise a
subgroup of informal, income-generating activities that
are often conducted in the home or unregulated
environments. Examples include brick making, fish
smoking, tobacco curing, and leather working. A
significant number of women worldwide are employed
by or run cottage industries and, by association, are
688
Special Features
[ 1 5 1 # 3 C H E S T M A R C H 2 0 1 7 ]
 exposed to COPD risk factors.37 Steps to educate
workers and minimize risk exposure may be useful. In
addition, social changes have resulted in women
increasingly working in industries that were once
dominated by men. Examples include the following:
construction; mining; working with leather; manufacture
of plastics, rubber, textiles, and food products; spray
painting; and welding. These jobs entail subsequent
exposure to the associated hazards.38 Occupational
health advisors should consider strategies to reduce risk
exposure rates, especially in relation to cottage
industries.
Low Socioeconomic Status
Having low socioeconomic status and/or living in low-
and middle-income countries increases the risk of
developing COPD and COPD-associated mortality.39-41
This scenario is of particular relevance for women, who
continue to be paid less than men and participate in
labor markets on an unequal basis.42 Public health
strategies and research are needed to address the
socioeconomic status disparity between men and
women.
Respiratory Infections
Evidence is growing to support the role of respiratory
infections in the development, severity, and progression
of COPD in both men and women.8,43,44 Such findings
are of significance in women due to the enormous global
health-care burden of respiratory infections in women
worldwide.
Hyperresponsiveness
Evidence suggests that the prevalence of airway
hyperresponsiveness may be greater in women than in
men; hyperresponsiveness is an important predictor of
decline in lung function and, possibly, also a greater
susceptibility to the effects of smoking in women.45,46
Although airway hyperresponsiveness is a hallmark of
asthma, which is also more common in women than in
men, it frequently occurs in patients with COPD. In
addition, asthma and COPD co-exist in some patients,
and both conditions may be manifestations of the same
basic disease process, as stated in the “Dutch
hypothesis.”47,48
Key Suggestions
A multifaceted approach is required to mitigate COPD
risk in women, including: educational initiatives
(eg, targeted awareness campaigns, pregnancy initiatives,
school-aged programs), practical steps to minimize risk
exposure (eg, tailored smoking cessation initiatives,
better housing design, occupational protection,
respiratory infection risk minimization), political
policies (eg, restrictions on smoking in public places,
tobacco marketing, cigarette pricing), and better
treatment. Initiatives should recognize that the COPD
risk factors most commonly experienced by women are
not identical to those in men.
COPD Characteristics and Presentation in
Women
Although the data are limited, evidence suggests that
women with COPD are generally younger, smoke less,
have a lower BMI, and are more likely to be of lower
socioeconomic status than men.11,49-53 In addition,
women are more likely to exhibit small airway disease
(bronchiolitis), whereas men are prone to develop an
emphysematous phenotype.15,50,54,55 It has been
suggested that biological differences may explain some
of the potential differences in disease presentation;
women have smaller lumina and disproportionately
thicker bronchial walls than men.50,55 It is important
that physicians are alert to these differences, as a lack of
awareness may be associated with delays in disease
diagnosis, which are known to have a detrimental
impact on patient outcomes.11
Several studies have assessed whether typical COPD
symptoms differ by sex. A number of studies have
shown similar COPD symptoms between men and
women.56,57 However, other studies have reported more
frequent and/or more severe exacerbations and higher
levels of dyspnea in women compared with
men.28,49,52,55,58-60 Although further studies are required,
a higher prevalence of airway hyperresponsiveness in
women than men may, at least partially, account for
some of the variability between sexes in symptoms such
as dyspnea.45,46
The higher rate of exacerbations in women vs men
with COPD, identified in some studies, may contribute
to the overall higher death rate in women in some
countries, such as the United States.28,49,55,59 In the
Evaluation of COPD Longitudinally to Identify
Predictive Surrogate Endpoints (ECLIPSE) COPD
cohort (n ¼ 2,164), the rate of exacerbations was found
to be significantly higher in women than in men at each
Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease
stage.58 Similarly, in a post hoc analysis from the
Prevention of Exacerbations with Tiotropium in
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (POET-COPD)
journal.publications.chestnet.org
689
 trial, the risk of first exacerbation was higher for women
compared with men (hazard ratio: 1.31 [95% CI:
1.19-1.43).59 Data from the Towards a Revolution in
COPD Health (TORCH) study also showed that the
time to first exacerbation was shorter and the rate of
exacerbations was 25% higher in women than in men
(P < .001; 95% CI: 16-34) (Fig 3), although the number
of hospital admissions caused by exacerbations was
similar in both sexes.49
Altogether, differences in dyspnea and BMI
contribute to poorer prognostic scores (eg, the Body-
mass Index, Airflow Obstruction, Dyspnea, and
Exercise Capacity Index) in women compared with
men who are matched for lung function and age.52
These findings warrant further investigation,
including the effect of these sex-related differences on
treatment and the utilization of health-care resources
by women.
Key Suggestions
Further research is needed to fully understand sex
differences in COPD symptoms and presentation.
Physicians should be aware of likely differences, such as
younger age of presentation and lower rates of primary
smoking.
Interactions Between Women With COPD and
Health-care Providers
Women with COPD are likely to have more frequent
interactions with health-care providers and use more
health-care resources than men.13,58,61,62 However, there
remains a “male dominated” bias in physicians’
awareness of COPD, which results in a higher rate of
misdiagnosis or delayed-diagnosis in women with
COPD compared with men, potentially leading to
suboptimal treatment.4,11,63,64 Although the sex bias in
diagnosis is reduced by the use of spirometry, this test in
general remains underused, particularly in women.63
There is some evidence to suggest that there may be
differences in men and women’s perception of the
COPD care they receive.64 In addition, coping strategies
may differ between men and women.65 Further research
in this area is needed to determine how women with
COPD can best be supported.
Key Suggestions
It is important for the health-care community to address
the sex bias that exists in the diagnosis of COPD.
Strategies include prompt use of spirometry and careful
history-taking to identify and quantify exposure risk.
Further research is needed to identify the factors
influencing attitudes and coping strategies for women
with COPD to enable improvements in care.
Focusing on the Patient: How Does COPD
Affect Women?
A majority of available studies have identified poorer
health status and quality of life (perceived and actual) in
women compared with men, although this finding is not
universal.50,58,60,62,66,67 A study of 90 patients with
COPD found that, for a similar degree of airway
obstruction, women presented with a greater
impairment in health status than men for all domains of
the St George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (Fig 4).62
Worse health status in women was also found in a study
of 10,711 patients with COPD who smoked, as
evidenced by their mainly lower scores in the mental
component of the 12-item Short-form Health Survey
compared with scores of corresponding male patients.67
Furthermore, older women may experience greater
psychosocial impairment related to COPD than men.68
Anxiety and depression contribute to the substantial
burden of COPD-related morbidity and are associated
with more impaired quality of life and reduced
adherence to treatment.69,70 Women with COPD report
higher levels of anxiety and depression than men with

 COPD, furthering the burden of COPD in
women.56,66,71-73
COPD exacerbations are associated with morbidity,
mortality, resource burden, and health-care costs. Even
after an exacerbation resolves, respiratory, physical,
social, and emotional impairments may persist for a
prolonged period of time. Although rates of
exacerbations may be higher in women (see earlier
discussion), some evidence suggests that outcomes
following an acute exacerbation may be better in women
than in men.65,74
The impact of higher levels of dyspnea, occurring at
earlier disease stages in women vs men, is important.49,75
Further research is needed to fully elucidate the reasons
underlying these differences,75 which may be related to
differential exposure to risk factors such as biomass fuels
and tobacco exposure,75,76 as well as different thresholds
of symptom awareness and reporting for men and
women.
Key Suggestions
There is some evidence suggesting sex-related
differences in the impact of COPD, but further research
is needed to explore more extensively the influence of
sex on COPD disease indicators, such as quality of life
and exacerbations, to facilitate tailored intervention
programs.
Evidence for Treating Women With COPD
The treatment of COPD involves a range of
interventions (pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic).
Where applicable, smoking cessation is an important
component of COPD intervention and may result in
even greater benefits in women compared with men.
Results from the Lung Health Study (n ¼ 3,348 men;
n ¼ 1,998 women) showed that the improvement in
FEV1% predicted was 2.3 times greater in women than
in men in the first year of smoking cessation.77
Unfortunately, women may be less successful with long-
term smoking cessation than men,27 especially with
nicotine replacement therapy, although some smoking
cessation agents (eg, bupropion, varenicline) seem to be
equally effective in men and women.4,6,13,78 The fact that
women seem to have a greater behavioral dependence
than men emphasizes the need for a tailored behavioral
approach.13
There is a distinct lack of evidence from clinical trials to
support physicians and the use of sex-focused
pharmacologic treatment of COPD.79 Current guidelines
are largely based on clinical trials that have recruited
many more men than women.8,80,81 The lack of sex-
specific recommendations could be because there is no
difference in the effectiveness or efficacy of treatments;
however, whether this assumption is true is unknown.
Analyses suggest that clinical trial populations differ
from real-world patients, particularly in sex
distribution.82 There is a need for future trials to include
more female participants and to prespecify subanalyses
on the basis of sex to study whether biological
differences affect the way women respond to
medications and therapeutic strategies.82 In addition,
studies should consider the use of sex as a variable in its
own right.79
The lack of current evidence represents, in the view of
the authors, a missed opportunity, as most large
randomized controlled trials could provide valuable data
on the impact of sex. Furthermore, although not as
robust as prespecified analyses, the opportunity exists to
perform post hoc analyses on available datasets and
pooled datasets from existing randomized controlled
trials. Such analyses would significantly increase the
number of women analyzed and may provide powerful
findings.
On theoretical grounds, there are good reasons to tailor
the medications prescribed for COPD to account for sex.
For instance, women are generally more prone than men
to develop osteoporosis and are more likely to develop it
at an earlier age. Therefore, high-dose inhaled
corticosteroids could be relatively more detrimental in
women than in men.83 Women receiving inhaled

 corticosteroids should have their bone mineral density
monitored and be prescribed vitamin D, calcium, and
treatments for osteoporosis, where appropriate.
Differences between sexes in ability and adherence to
treatment warrant consideration. For example, some
evidence highlights potential differences in inhaler
technique between sexes, with women experiencing greater
difficulties; however, such findings require further study.84
A multidisciplinary pulmonary rehabilitation program
should form an important component of COPD therapy
for all patients and should include exercise, nutritional
counseling, and patient education.6 However, data
concerning the impact of sex on the effects of pulmonary
rehabilitation are scarce. Some evidence suggests that
women and men may differ in their response to
pulmonary rehabilitation, but this finding is not
universal, and more research is needed.85-88
In addition to interventions directly targeting COPD,
recognition and treatment of relevant comorbidities are
important. COPD often coexists with other diseases,
and the presence of comorbidities can detrimentally
impact health status, COPD progression, and
outcomes. A number of studies have shown a higher
burden of comorbidities in women compared with
men.28,32,58,61 In particular, women seem to have
greater susceptibility to asthma, osteoporosis, anxiety,
and depression but are less likely to have cardiovascular
disease.32,52,56,60,61,67 It should also be recognized that
more women than men experience overlap between
asthma and COPD, which may result in a higher
overall health-care burden than the separate
components alone.89 Care should be taken when
selecting COPD treatments to ensure that the chosen
therapy does not negatively affect comorbidities.
Key Suggestions
More clinical data are needed on the sex-specific effects
of various interventions and sex-specific differences in
response to treatment. Post hoc analyses of data from
completed randomized controlled trials and pooled
databases would provide useful insights into sex-specific

 treatment responses. Clear guidance is needed to enable
physicians to better recognize and treat comorbidities in
women with COPD.
Summary and Future Focus
There is clearly an urgent need to both raise levels of
awareness of COPD in women and to implement more
successful strategies for the prevention and treatment of
COPD in women. When formulating these strategies,
the inherent differences between COPD in men and
women (biological and cultural) and the practical
consequences of these differences should be considered
(summarized in Table 1). A multifaceted approach
encapsulating policy makers, the research community,
health-care providers, employers, women, and caregivers
is required that examines risk (primary and secondary)
avoidance strategies. Better awareness within the health-
care community of the increasing burden of COPD in
women is important to improve disease diagnosis and
treatment. A tailored pharmaceutical approach based on
the sex-specific differences in symptoms and health
status is needed moving forward. The availability of
education programs for women with COPD and their
families would empower patients to manage their
disease more effectively.
