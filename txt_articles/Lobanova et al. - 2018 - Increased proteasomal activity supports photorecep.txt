Inherited retinal degenerations, affecting more than 2 million people worldwide, are caused
by mutations in over 200 genes. This suggests that the most efficient therapeutic strategies
would be mutation independent, i.e., targeting common pathological conditions arising from
many disease-causing mutations. Previous studies revealed that one such condition is an
insufficiency of the ubiquitin–proteasome system to process misfolded or mistargeted
proteins in affected photoreceptor cells. We now report that retinal degeneration in mice can
be significantly delayed by increasing photoreceptor proteasomal activity. The largest effect
is observed upon overexpression of the 11S proteasome cap subunit, PA28α, which enhanced
ubiquitin-independent protein degradation in photoreceptors. Applying this strategy to mice
bearing one copy of the P23H rhodopsin mutant, a mutation frequently encountered in
human patients, quadruples the number of surviving photoreceptors in the inferior retina of
6-month-old mice. This striking therapeutic effect demonstrates that proteasomes are an
attractive target for fighting inherited blindness.

ereditary degenerative diseases of the retina, including
retinitis pigmentosa (RP), affect nearly 2 million patients
worldwide1. These conditions are caused by ~4500
distinct mutations in more than 250 genes2. Such incredible
genetic diversity complicates the understanding of underlying
pathology
and
suggests
that
the
most
useful
therapeutic
interventions would employ mutation-independent strategies that
can ameliorate the cellular pathology shared across large groups
of mutations and patients. Studies of animal RP models have
revealed a number of common pathological conditions: oxidative
stress3, unfolded protein response4,5, retinoid cytotoxicity6, iron
toxicity7, and aberrant phototransduction8.
Our recent work demonstrated that another major cellular
stress factor prevalent in a broad spectrum of mouse RP models is
the insufficient capacity of the ubiquitin–proteasome system to
process misfolded or mistargeted proteins in affected cells9. We
further demonstrated that the severity of photoreceptor retinal
degeneration correlates with the degree of misfolded protein
production. A similar condition has subsequently been found in
the mouse model of Bardet–Biedl Syndrome10, a disorder
affecting photoreceptors among other ciliated cells11. Conversely,
genetic
manipulation
reducing
the
proteolytic
capacity
of proteasomes evoked RP-like pathology in otherwise normal
retinas12.
The goal of the present study was to determine whether
survival of degenerating photoreceptors could be supported by
enhancing the proteolytic capacity of their proteasomes. We
aimed to increase the proteasome activity in these cells using two
independent genetic strategies and found that the strongest effect
was achieved by overexpressing the PA28α subunit of the 11S
proteasome cap. We also show that the underlying mechanism is
based primarily on the stimulation of ubiquitin-independent
protein degradation. Breeding PA28α-overexpressing mice with
two mouse models of photoreceptor degeneration results in a
delay of disease progression. Particularly striking photoreceptor
preservation is observed in the mouse bearing one copy
of the P23H mutation in rhodopsin gene, which is frequently
encountered in North American RP patients.
Results
Proteasomal composition of the mouse retina. To develop
efficient
strategies
for
enhancing
proteasomal
activity
in
photoreceptors, we first analyzed the molecular composition of
proteasomes in the mouse retina. Proteasomes are multi-subunit
complexes
assembled
upon
association
of
two
principal
components: the 20S core and the regulatory caps. The 20S core is
responsible for the entire proteolytic process; however, its basal
activity is very low in the absence of regulatory caps. The most
common caps
are
19S and
11S,
which
facilitate
protein
degradation in ubiquitin-dependent and -independent manners,
respectively. A single 20S core may associate with one or two caps
(either identical or different) at the sites located at the opposite
ends of the 20S barrel-like structure13,14.
We first determined the stoichiometry among these three
proteasomal components in the whole wild-type (WT) mouse
retina using quantitative mass spectrometry with isotope-labeled
peptide standards corresponding to representative proteasome
subunits: α7 and β1 for 20S, PSMD5 and PSMD6 for 19S, and
PA28α for 11S (Fig. 1a; see Methods for details of this analysis).
These measurements revealed that the amount of 19S caps in the
mouse retina is equivalent to 86 ± 7% of 20S cores, while the
amount of 11S caps corresponds to only 16 ± 1% of 20S cores
(taking into account that each 11S particle contains seven
PA28 subunits represented by roughly equal amounts of PA28α
and PA28β) (mean ± SEM; n = 3).
We then assessed the patterns in which these proteasomal
components associate with one another. Retinal extracts obtained
from WT mice were subjected to size-exclusion chromatography
and the distribution of proteasomal complexes across chromato-
graphic fractions was determined by western blotting of proteins
representing each of the 20S, 19S, and 11S particles (β1, PSMD11,
and PA28α, respectively; Fig. 1b). Experiments were performed in
the presence of ATP, which is essential to preserve the 20S–19S
complex assembly15. A typical chromatogram, shown in Fig. 1b,
illustrates that 20S core particles eluted in two peaks of similar
sizes. One, containing 45 ± 2% (mean ± SEM; n = 4) of 20S cores,
co-eluted with the entire pool of 19S caps and another, containing
55 ± 2% of 20S, did not co-elute with either cap type. This excess
of free 20S cores is a common phenomenon previously observed
in various tissues and cell types16–18. Unlike 19S caps, 11S caps
migrated in fractions lacking the 20S core, which could be
explained either by the absence of 11S–20S complex in normal
retinas or relatively low stability of this complex upon protein
extraction and chromatography due to the relatively low affinity
between 11S caps and 20S cores19,20. Additional evidence that the
amount of 20S core particles in the retina exceeds the amount of
19S cap was obtained by performing native gel electrophoresis
of retinal lysates (Supplementary Fig. 1). Whereas the entire pool
of 19S caps was distributed between the bands representing singly
and doubly capped 20S cores, 20S exhibited a third band
corresponding to its non-capped form.
Next, we estimated the fraction of proteasomes residing in rod
photoreceptor cells. The retina is a layered tissue consisting of
many cell types connected in complex networks. This makes
obtaining preparative quantities of pure photoreceptor cells a
nearly impossible task. However, because (i) photoreceptor cells
form a compact layer which occupies roughly one half of the
retinal volume (as illustrated in a representative retina cross-
section in Fig. 1c) and (ii) ~97% of mouse photoreceptors are
rods21, the fractional content of any retinal protein confined to
rods can be estimated by analyzing the prevalence of this protein
in serial tangential sections representing the photoreceptor-dense
half of the retina22. Therefore, we obtained serial tangential
sections through the entire flat-mounted retina, measured
the levels of proteasomal proteins across all individual sections
by western blotting, and calculated their fractional contents
in
the
photoreceptor
layer,
i.e.,
those
containing
the
photoreceptor-specific protein marker, phosducin (Fig. 1c). This
estimate revealed that rod photoreceptors contain ~2/3 of all
retinal proteasomes (65 ± 7% of 20S, 60 ± 4% of 19S, and 47 ± 4%
of 11S; n = 2).
Overall, these experiments demonstrated that photoreceptors
contain more than one half of all retinal proteasomes, which are
represented primarily by comparable amounts of 26S complexes
and free 20S cores. This suggests that the simplest approach to
enhance proteasomal activity in these cells would be to stimulate
the activity of free 20S cores by increasing the amount or affinity
of regulatory caps. We followed this strategy in subsequent
experiments.
Rod proteasome activity can be enhanced by PA28α over-
expression. Our first approach to enhance proteasome activity in
rods was the overexpression of 11S caps, whose binding to the
ends of 20S core particles facilitates substrate access to proteolytic
activities confined inside the 20S barrel-like structure. Normally,
this cap is formed by a hetero-heptameric ring consisting of
PA28α and PA28β subunits23. The stoichiometry between PA28α
and PA28β was assessed to be either 3:4 or 4:3 in two indepen-
dent in vitro studies24,25. However, functional 11S caps can also
be formed by the PA28α subunits alone, although they bind 20S

 cores with a lower affinity and stimulate their proteolytic activity
to a lesser degree than hetero-heptameric caps20,24. Therefore, we
overexpressed PA28α using the well-established transgenic pro-
tocol utilizing the rod-specific rhodopsin promoter26. Three
mouse lines underwent germline transmission. Among them, we
selected the one whose retinal PA28α content was 77±3-fold
higher than in WT mice (mean ± SEM; n = 5; Fig. 2a; see Sup-
plementary Fig. 2 for representative data). This corresponds to a
comparable level of 11S cap overexpression in rods because the
fraction of endogenous PA28α in rods and the fraction of PA28α
in endogenous 11S caps are each close to 50% and, therefore,
cancel one another in this calculation. Considering the ratio
between the endogenous 20S and 11S particles in photoreceptors
estimated above and assuming that all expressed PA28α sub-
units assemble into 11S caps, we conclude that the resulting 11S
content in transgenic rods exceeds their 20S content by ~9-fold.
Western blot analysis of retinal extracts obtained from
transgenic animals demonstrated that PA28α overexpression
did not affect the expression of other proteasomal subunits
(Fig. 2a). This differs from two previous reports that PA28α
overexpression in cell culture and transgenic mouse cardiomyo-
cytes causes a concurrent overexpression of PA28β27,28, likely
reflecting variation in gene regulation patterns across individual
cell types. Importantly, the overexpression of PA28α did not
cause any adverse effects on photoreceptor health, as evidenced
by normal photoreceptor morphology analyzed in 3-month-old
transgenic mice (Fig. 2b).
The effect of PA28α overexpression on proteasomal activity in
retinal extracts was first assessed using the fluorogenic substrate
of
chymotrypsin-like
activity,
Suc-LLVY-amc.
The
activity
measured in extracts from overexpressing retinas in the presence
of ATP was 26% higher than extracts from WT controls
(p = 7×10−5; Fig. 2c). Given that rods contain close to 2/3 of
total retinal proteasomes, this corresponds to ~40% activity
increase in these cells. Enhanced proteolysis of the fluorogenic
peptide substrate caused by PA28α overexpression was preserved
in the absence of ATP (63% increase over WT; p = 0.01; Fig. 2c,
right panel), although the absolute activity increase in this case
was smaller than when ATP was present.
In contrast, overexpression of PA28α did not significantly
affect the ubiquitin-dependent proteasome activity in retinal
lysates. This lack of activity increase was observed in experiments
conducted
with
both
polyubiquitinated
protein
and
a
tetraubiquitin-peptide fusion (Fig. 3).
We next attempted to identify proteasome complexes formed
upon PA28α overexpression. One possibility is that overexpressed
11S caps bind at one or both ends of free 20S core particles.
Alternatively, 11S overexpression could lead to the formation of
“hybrid proteasomes”, which contain a 19S cap at one end and an
11S cap at the other29. We conducted size-exclusion chromato-
graphy of retinal lysates from PA28α overexpressing mice and
found that a distinct portion of PA28α elutes earlier than in
control WT lysates, partially overlapping with 20S cores (Fig. 2d).
Averaging data across three independent chromatography runs
(Supplementary Fig. 3) showed that this portion of PA28α
represents ~4% of its total amount and ~2% of PA28α co-elutes
with 20S. This suggests that PA28α overexpression leads to
formation of the 20S–11S complexes. However, the lack of
complete overlap between the profiles of this leftward-shifted
PA28α and the entire peak of 20S cores free of 19S suggests that
these putative complexes are unstable and fall apart in the course
of a chromatography run. This is consistent with the low affinity

 between 20S particles and 11S caps formed exclusively from the
PA28α subunits20,24. Interestingly, we did not observe a notable
reciprocal leftward shift in the chromatography profile of the
second 20S peak upon PA28α overexpression. This may be
explained by a combination of modest increase in the 20S’ Stokes
radius upon binding a relatively compact 11S cap and the
instability of this complex during a chromatography run. We also
analyzed chromatographic behavior of the endogenous PA28β
subunit and found no difference between WT and PA28α
overexpressing lysates (Supplementary Fig. 3). Therefore, all 11S
caps formed upon PA28α overexpression are homomeric. Finally,
the overexpression of PA28α did not result in any fraction of the
19S caps eluting apart from the 20S cores, which argues against a
hypothetical
possibility
that
overexpressed
11S
caps
out-
competed endogenous 19S caps from their 20S complexes.
In conclusion, PA28α overexpression appears to be a viable
approach to enhancing proteasomal activity in rods, particularly
in respect to the processing of non-ubiquitinated substrates.
Rod proteasome activity can be enhanced by PSMD11 over-
expression. The structure of the 19S proteasome cap is more
complex than the 11S cap. It consists of 19 individual proteins
forming two subassemblies30. Although we are not aware of

 evidence suggesting that overexpressing any of these proteins
could increase the cellular content of 19S caps, several studies
showed that proteasomal activity could be enhanced by over-
expressing one of its subunits, PSMD1131–34. The underlying
mechanism is not fully understood and is thought to involve
stabilization of the 19S–20S complex31, likely requiring PSMD11
phosphorylation33. We overexpressed PSMD11 in rods using the
same transgenic approach as above.
Of four mouse lines that underwent germline transmission, we
selected the highest expressing line whose retinas contained
4.2 ± 0.1-fold more PSMD11 than control WT littermates (mean
± SEM; n = 4; Fig. 2a; see Supplementary Fig. 2 for representative
data), corresponding to a roughly 6-fold PSMD11 overexpression
in rods. Just as in the case of PA28α, PSMD11 overexpression did
not adversely affect photoreceptor health (Fig. 2b). Proteasomal
activity measured in retinal extracts from PSMD11 overexpres-
sing mice using the fluorogenic (AMC)-conjugated peptide
substrate, Suc-LLVY-amc, was 12% higher than in extracts from
WT controls (p = 0.011; Fig. 2c), which corresponds to ~18%
activity increase in rods (calculated as above). In this case, the
activity increase was strictly ATP-dependent. Notably, this effect
was smaller than the ~40% increase achieved upon PA28α
overexpression (although the p value of 0.07 between the two
overexpression conditions fell slightly short of reaching statistical
significance).
We examined the ubiquitin-dependent proteasome activity in
retinal extracts from PSMD11 overexpressing mice using both
polyubiquitinated protein and a tetraubiquitin-peptide fusion
substrate, but did not observe any notable deviation from the
corresponding activities analyzed with their WT littermate
controls (Fig. 3). This suggests that proteasomal activation in
this case was at least mostly ubiquitin independent. Size-exclusion
chromatography of retinal extracts from PSMD11 overexpressing
mice yielded a profile very similar to WT extracts, except for a
distinct PSMD11 portion eluting toward the end of the
chromatographic profile, presumably not associated with any
other proteins (Fig. 2d). Taken together, these data indicate that
PSMD11 overexpression may serve as an approach to proteaso-
mal activity enhancement in rods, although not as promising as
PA28α overexpression.
Proteasome activity enhancement improves the survival of
P23H rods. In the next series of experiments, we tested whether
proteasomal activity enhancement could ameliorate photo-
receptor degeneration caused by an RP-associated mutation. We
chose a mouse model bearing a P23H single amino acid sub-
stitution at one rhodopsin allele35, a mutation prevalent among
North American RP patients36. The underlying pathology is
thought to be associated with inability of mutant rhodopsin to
properly fold in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Instead of being
delivered to photoreceptor outer segments, P23H rhodopsin
undergoes ER-associated degradation (ERAD), which targets
misfolded proteins to the proteasomal degradation pathway37.
This process ultimately evokes an unfolded protein response37,
and compromises the capacity of the ubiquitin–proteasome
system to process other cellular substrates, as documented in our
previous study of an alternative mouse model expressing the

 P23H rhodopsin mutant transgene9. Interestingly, the degrada-
tion of unfolded P23H rhodopsin is so efficient that no prominent
aggregates form at any stage of this pathology35.
We now confirmed that, like in transgenic P23H mice, rods of
the P23H knockin mice suffer from proteasomal insufficiency
(Supplementary Fig. 4). This is evident from the accumulation of
the UbG76V–GFP proteasomal activity reporter in mutant
photoreceptors (panels A and B) and increased levels of
polyubiquitinated proteins in the retina (panels C and D). At
the same time, the amount and the activity of proteasomes in
mutant retinas remained essentially unchanged (panels E and F,
respectively). These parameters were measured in young P23H
mice in order to minimize any complications associated with the
ongoing photoreceptor loss.
P23H mice were crossed with mice overexpressing either
PA28α or PSMD11. Measurements in retinal lysates conducted
with the Suc-LLVY-amc substrate confirmed that the proteaso-
mal activity increase caused by these proteins’ overexpression was
essentially the same as in WT mice (Supplementary Fig. 5) The
morphological phenotypes of these mice were analyzed in retinal
cross-sections at the ages of 3 and 6 months (Fig. 4 and
Supplementary Figs. 6 and 7). Even superficial examination of
these sections shows that retinal degeneration was slowed in both
cases, with overexpression of PA28α causing a particularly
striking effect. To quantify this effect, we counted the number
of photoreceptor nuclei in 100 μm retinal segments at different
distances from the optic nerve and plotted the results as spider
diagrams
(Fig.
4a).
These
diagrams
document
substantial
improvement in photoreceptor survival across the entire retina.
Of particular interest is the part of inferior retina adjacent to
the optic nerve head, which undergoes the most rapid photo-
receptor loss in this animal model37. At the age of 3 months, mice
overexpressing PSMD11 retained ~40% more surviving photo-
receptors than their WT littermates, as judged from the number
of photoreceptor nuclei in this area, whereas overexpression of
PA28α increased this number by a remarkable 130% (Fig. 4b). By
the age of 6 months, the P23H retina was devastated, with a single
row of remaining photoreceptor nuclei representing mostly
surviving cones. In contrast, P23H mice overexpressing PSMD11
preserved at least one additional row of nuclei, while mice
overexpressing PA28α had at least three additional rows.
To quantify these changes across the entire retina, we
combined the nuclear counts obtained at all locations analyzed
in the spidergrams and plotted the resulting values for each
genotype and age (Fig. 4c). This analysis revealed that over-
expression of PA28α increased photoreceptor survival by ~2 and
~2.3-fold at 3 and 6 months, respectively. The corresponding
parameters observed upon PSMD11 overexpression were ~1.3
and ~1.5-fold.
To assess whether the preservation of photoreceptor morphol-
ogy in these mice was in fact associated with improved retinal
function, we analyzed them using electroretinography (ERG).

 ERGs are massed field potentials which reflect the combined
light-evoked activity of many retinal cells. The negative ERG
deflection immediately following the flash stimulus, called the a-
wave, originates primarily from the suppression of the circulating
dark current in rod and cone outer segments. The subsequent
positive deflection, called the b-wave, originates mainly from the
light-induced depolarizing currents in ON-bipolar cells down-
stream from photoreceptors and represents amplified photo-
receptor responses38,39. In degenerating retinas, changes in the
amount and health of surviving photoreceptors are reflected by
reduced amplitudes of both waves.
The data shown in Fig. 5 demonstrate that PA28α over-
expression resulted in a robust improvement of retinal visual
function in P23H mice. By the age of 3 months, untreated P23H
mice experienced a roughly 2-fold reduction in the maximal
amplitudes of a- and b-waves recorded across a broad range of
light intensities. The overexpression of PA28α counteracted this
reduction, yielding maximal a- and b-wave amplitudes ~40% and
~25% higher than observed in control P23H littermates (Fig. 5a).
An even larger therapeutic effect was observed at 6 months. At
this age, maximal amplitudes of both a- and b-waves in PA28α
overexpressing mice were ~240% higher than in P23H control
(Fig. 5b).
Perhaps the most foretelling data were obtained at dim flash
intensities under ~0.05 cd/s/m2 at which ERG responses are
driven almost exclusively by rods39,40. Under these conditions,
light responses of 6-month-old P23H mice were essentially
abolished, consistent with nearly all rods degenerating by this age.
In contrast, P23H mice overexpressing PA28α retained an ability
to produce robust light responses of nearly half normal
amplitude.
This
result is particularly
well-illustrated
in a
representative response to a flash of 0.005 cd/s/m2 (Fig. 5b, right
panel), indicating that the functional impact on rod preservation
upon PA28α overexpression is even more striking than the total
nuclear count in Fig. 4 may suggest.
Also consistent with morphological data, PSMD11 overexpres-
sion resulted in a marginal preservation of retinal activity. In this
case, statistically significant amplitude increase was observed only
for b-waves, likely reflecting amplification of more subtle a-wave
changes (Supplementary Fig. 8). Whereas this lesser therapeutic
effect of overexpressing PSMD11 than PA28α may be potentially
attributed to the difference in their relative cellular levels, the
authors favor a possibility that it reflects the difference in the
mechanisms
by
which
each
overexpression
modifies
the
relationship between 20S proteasomes and their regulatory caps.
Conceptually, these data are significant because they show that
proteasomal activation improves the health of degenerating
photoreceptors regardless of whether it is achieved by providing
20S cores with additional 11S caps or modifying 20S–19S
interactions.
Proteasome activity enhancement improves the survival of
Gγ1−/− rods. In another set of experiments, we tested whether an
enhancement of proteasomal activity could delay the course of
retinal degeneration in another mouse model, the knockout of the
γ-subunit of photoreceptor-specific G protein transducin (the
Gγ1−/− mouse); this mouse served as a primary model in our
previous study9. Rods of Gγ1−/− mice produce large amounts of
transducin β-subunit (Gβ1). Being unable to properly fold
without its cognate Gγ1 partner, Gβ1 is continuously targeted for
proteasomal degradation resulting in a proteostatic crisis and,
ultimately, photoreceptor cell death9.
Gγ1−/− mice were crossed with PA28α overexpressing mice
and retinal morphology of the progeny was analyzed at the age of
3 months (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Fig. 9). The spider diagram
in Fig. 6a shows that PA28α overexpression improved the
photoreceptor survival across the entire retina. Integrating the
nuclear counts for all locations analyzed in the spidergrams
(Fig. 6b) revealed that overexpressing retinas contained 21%
more photoreceptor nuclei than untreated Gγ1−/− controls
(p = 0.0002). Not only the number of surviving photoreceptors
was higher, but also the morphological appearance of their nuclei

 was more uniform across the entire photoreceptor population
(Fig. 6c).
However, the extent of photoreceptor rescue achieved upon
PA28α overexpression (Fig. 6) was smaller than in P23H mice
(Fig. 4). This result is not immediately intuitive because the
degree of proteasomal insufficiency in Gγ1−/− mice, judged from
the degree of intracellular accumulation of the UbG76V–GFP
reporter, appears to be more pronounced than in P23H mice
(Supplementary Fig. 4). A likely explanation for this discrepancy
derives from the fact that UbG76V–GFP accumulation reflects
insufficient photoreceptor capacity to process ubiquitinated
protein
substrates,
whereas
PA28α
overexpression
has
no
significant effect on the ubiquitination-dependent protein degra-
dation (Fig. 3). Accordingly, the degree by which photoreceptors
may benefit from PA28α overexpression may not directly
correspond to the degree of reporter accumulation.
This explanation would further predict that accumulation of
the UbG76V–GFP reporter may not directly correlate with the
therapeutic effect achieved by PA28α overexpression. We tested
this prediction in the last set of experiments by analyzing P23H
and Gγ1−/− mice expressing both PA28α and UbG76V–GFP. As
shown in Fig. 7, overexpression of PA28α was not accompanied
by any notable reduction in UbG76V–GFP accumulation in either
model, which is consistent with the importance of ubiquitin-
independent protein degradation for rescue using this approach.
Discussion
Following initial demonstrations that insufficient activity of the
ubiquitin–proteasome system is a prominent stress factor in
multiple forms of inherited retinal degeneration9,10, we investi-
gated whether ameliorating this stress by increasing the activity of
photoreceptor proteasomes could have a therapeutic effect. Our
most successful approach was to overexpress the PA28α subunit
of the 11S proteasome cap. PA28α overexpression supported
photoreceptor survival in degenerating retinas, with a particularly
striking effect achieved in a common model of RP, the P23H
mouse. While untreated mice lose nearly all rods by 6 months of
age, PA28α overexpression preserves enough rods to sustain
robust retinal visual outputs in dim light conditions.
The major impact of this study is that it provides a proof-of-
principle that cellular proteostasis as a whole and proteasomes in
particular could serve as a therapeutic target for treating RP and
related diseases. The hallmark of RP is that the underlying
mutations typically affect rods, whereas debilitating visual loss
does not occur until rod degeneration reaches its final stages
when otherwise healthy cones start degenerating as well.
Accordingly, the period between the onset of rod degeneration
and the patient becoming legally blind often spans several dec-
ades. In this context, the effect of PA28α overexpression in P23H
mice, and even the relatively modest effect observed upon
PSMD11 overexpression in these mice or PA28α overexpression
in Gγ1−/− mice, would correspond to years-to-decades of pro-
longed vision in patients.
The therapeutic effect of PA28α overexpression was achieved
through
the
stimulation
of
ubiquitin-independent
protein
degradation. Lysates obtained from transgenic retinas displayed a
significant increase in the level of ubiquitin-independent pro-
teasomal activity, which we estimated to represent an ~40%
activity increase in overexpressing rod photoreceptors. In con-
trast, the degradation of ubiquitinated substrates by the same
lysates was not significantly different from WT controls, at least
within the resolution capacity of available techniques. Consistent
with the latter, the overexpression of PA28α in P23H or Gγ1−/−

 rods was not associated with a detectable change in the intra-
cellular accumulation of the UbG76V-GFP reporter.
Another, closely related question is whether PA28α over-
expression in photoreceptors leads to the formation of any hybrid
proteasomes, containing 19S and 11S caps on the opposite sides
of a 20S core particle29,41, or 20S cores singly or doubly capped by
11S. The intrinsic instability of proteasome complexes containing
11S caps formed exclusively by PA28α20 limits the experimental
options to address this question. One approach was to analyze the
ATP dependency of Suc-LLVY-amc degradation because hybrid
proteasomes, but not 11S–20S complexes, rely on ATP for their
stability. Our measurements revealed both ATP-dependent and
ATP-independent
components
of
the
proteasome
activity
increase in the lysates from overexpressing retinas, suggesting
that both types of proteasome complexes were present. Gel-
filtration experiments were less foretelling. They revealed a high
molecular mass shift in the elution profile of a small portion of
overexpressed PA28α. Some of this shifted PA28α co-eluted with
20S cores and none with 19S caps. While consistent with the
presence of 11S–20S complexes, this result does not entirely
exclude that hybrid proteasomes were initially present in the
retinal lysate but lost their 11S caps during the chromatography
run due to the low affinity of homomeric 11S caps20,24. But
regardless of whether or not hybrid proteasomes were formed
along with the 11S–20S complexes, PA28α overexpression did not
facilitate the processing of polyubiquitinated substrates in retinal
lysates or decreased the UbG76V–GFP accumulation in over-
expressing photoreceptors.
Looking forward, this study lays the foundation for several
exciting mechanistic directions. It will be important to under-
stand why stimulation of ubiquitin-independent proteasomal
degradation in degenerating photoreceptors improves their
health. One potential explanation relates to the ability of pro-
teasomes
to degrade
certain
proteins
without
their
poly-
ubiquitination42. In many cases, this process still requires the
involvement of 19S caps. However, there are two notable excep-
tions—the adaptive immune response and adaptation to oxidative
stress—in which protein degradation is performed by 20S pro-
teasomes themselves43. Oxidative stress is among the most fre-
quently mentioned stress factors in RP pathology3, which makes
it possible that increased 20S accessibility to oxidized substrates
achieved through the 11S caps formed upon PA28α over-
expression explains, at least in part, the therapeutic effect revealed
in our study.
It would also be interesting to explore why this approach
benefits P23H mice more than Gγ1−/− mice. Conversely, it would
be important to elucidate whether stimulation of ubiquitin-
dependent protein degradation, for example by inhibiting sub-
strate deubiquitination by the UPS14 subunit of the 19S cap44,
would have a similar effect. We anticipate that addressing these
mechanistic questions in future studies would allow better iden-
tification of patient cohorts that would most benefit from this
approach.
Another experimental area, likely to be stimulated by our
demonstration that retinal degeneration could be slowed down by
an enhancement of cellular proteostasis, is to test whether a
similar therapeutic effect could be achieved by inhibiting the rate
of protein synthesis. This idea was recently put forward in a study
employing pharmacological inhibition of protein translation in
P23H rodent models45. While this treatment did improve the
folding and trafficking of mutant rhodopsin, it ultimately accel-
erated photoreceptor cell death, apparently because the stabilized
P23H mutant was toxic. Although this result was disappointing, it
may be worthwhile to consider this strategy for alternative RP-
causing mutations before generalizing this negative outcome.
Finally, our study places inherited retinal degenerations among
the expanding group of neurodegenerative disorders whose pro-
gression could potentially be ameliorated by augmenting cellular
proteostasis (reviewed in refs. 46–48). As an organ well-accessible
to a broad array of interventions, from conventional small
molecule treatments to gene therapy, the eye could serve as a
nearly unmatched system to test the efficacy of any future therapy
targeting cellular proteostasis in neurodegeneration. Furthermore,
the outcomes of these treatments can be monitored with unpar-
alleled quantitative precision using modern imaging techniques49.
The early diagnosis of RP allows therapeutic modulation of the
ubiquitin–proteasome system to begin early, thereby facilitating
its validation and maximizing its gains.
Methods
Knockout and transgenic animals. Mouse care and experiments were performed
in accordance with procedures approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee of Duke University. Gγ1−/− mice were licensed from Deltagen Inc. (San
Mateo, CA)and characterized previously9. P23H mice described in ref. 35 were
purchased from Jackson Labs (stock #017628). Transgenic mice heterozygously
expressing the UbG76V-GFP reporter are described in ref. 50. Transgenic mice
overexpressing PA28α and PSMD11 under the control of rhodopsin promoter were
generated by Duke Transgenic Facility using standard protocols described in refs.
40,51 on the C57BL/6J background. Transgenic mouse lines were maintained by
heterozygous breeding with C57BL/6J WT mice (stock #000664) and tested for the
lack of Rd1 and Rd8 mutations. All experiments with overexpressing mice were
performed using WT and/or non-expressing littermate controls; all animals in this
study were pigmented; mice of both sexes were used.
Antibodies. Rabbit antibodies against Gγ1 (SC-373; 1:10,000) and the β1 subunit
of the 20S proteasome (SC-67345; 1:5000), as well as mouse antibody against β-
actin (SC-47778; 1:5000), were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Rabbit polyclonal
antibodies against the regulatory subunit 1, PSMD1, of the 19S cap (140682;
1:2000) and against the β5 subunit of the 20S core (3330; 1:2000) were from
Abcam. Mouse monoclonal anti-eGFP antibody (632381; 1:5000) was from
Clontech. Rabbit antibodies against PA28α (BML-PW8185; 1:5000) and HSC70/
HSP73 (ADI-SPA-819; 1:10,000) were from Enzo Life Science. Rabbit antibody
against PA28β (NB120-2940; 1:5000) was from Novus Biologicals. Mouse antibody
against PSMD11 (1:2000) was from Abnova. Rabbit antibody against polyubiquitin
(PA1-187; 1:4000) was from Thermo Fisher. Sheep anti-phosducin antibody
(1:10,000) is described in ref. 52. Mouse monoclonal anti-rhodopsin antibody 4D2
(1:5000) was a gift from R.S. Molday (University of British Columbia). Secondary
goat or donkey antibodies for western blotting conjugated with Alexa Fluor 680 (A-
21057) and 800 (SA5-10044) (both 1:10,000), were from Invitrogen, secondary
peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit (711-035-152) or anti mouse (715-035-150)
antibodies (both 1:10,000) were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories.
Protein bands were visualized and quantified using the Odyssey Infrared Imaging
System (LI-COR Biosciences) and ChemiDoc Imaging System (BioRad). The
photoreceptor outer segments were visualized by wheat germ agglutinin (WGA)
594 conjugate (W11262; 1:500) from Invitrogen. Uncropped gels used to generate
images in the figures are shown in Supplementary Fig. 10.
Size-exclusion chromatography. Retinal lysates obtained from two mice were
cleared of debris by centrifugation (20 min at 18,000×g at 4 °C) and subjected to gel
filtration on a Superose-6 attached to the FPLC system (Pharmacia) (Fig. 1 only) or
a Superose-6 Increase column attached to the AKTA pure 25 system (GE
Healthcare) at a flow rate of 500 μl/min in the running buffer containing 50 mM
Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 40 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1 mM DTT, and 1
mM ATP; 0.5 ml fractions were collected and proteins were precipitated by a 5-fold
dilution in cold acetone at −20 °C overnight. Precipitated proteins were collected
by centrifugation (15 min at 4 °C at 17,000×g), the pellets were air dried and
solubilized in the SDS/PAGE sample buffer for western blotting. Bands were
visualized and quantified using the Odyssey infrared imaging system (LiCor
Bioscience).
Native gel electrophoresis. All procedures, including tissue extraction, protein
separation, and detection, were performed as described in ref. 53 without mod-
ifications. The 26S proteasome standard (A1200) was obtained from UbpBio.
Quantitative mass spectrometry. The stoichiometric ratio of proteasomal sub-
units in retinal lysates from WT mice was determined by quantitative mass
spectrometry using cold isotope-labeled peptides standards, as described in ref. 9.
Synthetic peptide standards containing Lys (13C6, 15N2) or Arg (13C6, 15N4)
were obtained from JPT Peptide Technologies (Berlin, Germany). The 20S core was
represented by two peptides from the α7 subunit (LTVEDPVTVEYITR and
ALLEVVQSGGK) and two peptides from the β1 subunit (GAVYSFDPVGSYQR

 and DVYTGDALR). The 11S cap was represented by two peptides from PA28α
(TENLLGSYFPK and IEDGNNFGVAVQEK). The 19S cap was represented by two
peptides from the PSMD5 subunit (LEAPLEELR and ELTGEDVLVR) and two
peptides from the PSMD6 subunit (GAEILEVLHSLPAVR and FLLSLPEHR).
Standards were selected based on their robust identification in a preliminary LC/
MS/MS analysis of the whole retinal lysate, considering their ionization strength
and chemical stability. To reduce peptides’ non-specific binding to test tubes, all
dilutions were performed in 2% acetonitrile/0.1% formic acid containing 0.5 μM
leucine enkephalin. In a typical experiment, mouse retinas were lysed in PBS buffer
containing 1% Triton X-100 and cOmplete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche); 40
μg of proteins from the lysate were separated by SDS-PAGE on a 10% gel. A set of
2–3 gel bands corresponding to the location of each targeted proteasomal subunit
was spiked with of the corresponding peptide standard (100 fmol for α7 and β1 or
50 fmol for other subunits). Proteins were in-gel digested with trypsin and peptide
mixtures were analyzed on a 75 μm × 150 mm BEH100 1.7 μm C18 column cou-
pled to the Synapt G2 mass spectrometer (Waters). LC/MS analysis was performed
for each sample using a 90-min gradient of acetonitrile (6–32%) in 0.1% formic
acid. Peptide assignments in ion chromatograms were based on precise co-elution
with standard peptides, considering the corresponding mass shifts. Peptide ion
peaks for the first isotope in the cluster were integrated using MassLynx 4.1 soft-
ware (Waters) and the peptide amounts were calculated from the ratios between
the peak areas of peptides from retinal lysates and standard peptide. Each MS
analysis was performed in duplicate for three independently obtained mouse
lysates. To obtain a stoichiometric ratio among the 20S, 19S, and 11S components,
data were averaged across all lysates and MS repeats. For the final calculation, we
assumed that each 20S core contains two α7 and β1 subunits, each 19S cap contains
one PSMD5 and PSMD6 subunit, and each 11S contains an average of 3.5 PA28α.
Proteasome activity assays with fluorogenic peptides. Proteolytic activities of
proteasomes in retinal lysates were measured using the fluorogenic 7-Amino-4-
methylcoumarin (AMC)-conjugated peptide substrates following the protocols
described in ref. 15. Both retinas from one mouse were homogenized on ice using a
2 ml Dounce homogenizer in 400 μl buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6),
40 mM KCl, 5 mM, MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 10% glycerol, and 5 mM ATP in the
presence of cOmplete™ Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich), followed by
sedimentation for 20 min at 18,000×g. The time course of AMC fluorescence
increase was monitored in 50 μl aliquots for 2 h at 37 °C using a SpectraMax M5
(Molecular Devices) or CLARIOstar (BMG Labtech) plate readers with the fol-
lowing peptides: 100 μM Suc-LLVY-amc (a substrate for the chymotrypsin-like
proteasomal activity; UbpBio), 50 μM Boc-LRR-amc (a substrate for the trypsin-
like activity; UbpBio), and 250 μM Z-LLE-amc (a substrate for the caspase–like
activity; UbpBio). The absolute amounts of proteolyzed substrates were measured
using the AMC standard (Sigma-Aldrich). To study the ATP dependency of
proteasomal activity, aliquots of retinal extracts were incubated with apyrase
(Sigma) at the concentration of 10 units/ml for 30 min at room temperature in
order to hydrolyze the endogenous ATP, and the measurements were repeated as
above in the absence of added ATP.
Proteasome activity assays with polyubiquitinated substrates. 26S proteasome
activity was assessed by monitoring the degradation of ubiquitinated peptide and
protein substrates. The ubiquitinated peptide substrate was prepared as previously
described54. Protein substrate was generated by in vitro polyubiquitination of
truncated human WW domain-binding protein 2 (WBP2) followed by the labeling
reaction using Alexa Fluor 488 C5 Maleimide (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Retina
lysate was prepared in the buffer containing 40 mM HEPES (pH7.6), 100 mM KCl,
5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM ATP, 1 mM DTT in the presence of cOmplete™ Protease
Inhibitor Cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich). Fluorescence polarization assay was performed
in the same buffer supplemented with 2 μM ubiquitin aldehyde (Boston Biochem).
The reaction was initiated by mixing 4 μl retinal lysate containing 1.5 mg/ml
protein with 11 μl fluorescent-labeled peptide (5 nM) or protein (2.5 nM) substrate.
Assays were performed in low-volume 96-well solid black plates (Molecular
Devices) in triplicate. The reaction was monitored at 30 °C using a PHERAstar
plate reader (BMGlabtech) with excitation at 480 nm and emission at 520 nm.
Histological techniques. Agarose-embedded retinal cross-sections were prepared
as described55, collected in 24-well plates, and incubated for 2 h with Alexa Fluor
594 conjugate of wheat germ agglutinin (Invitrogen) in PBS containing 0.1% Triton
X-100. Sections were washed three times in PBS, mounted with Fluoromount G
(Electron Microscopy Sciences) under glass coverslips, and visualized using a Nikon
Eclipse 90i confocal microscope. GFP fluorescence was excited at 488 nm. Plastic-
embedded retinal cross-sections (1 μm) were prepared as described in refs. 9,56 and
stained with toluidine blue for light microscopy. Nuclear count in 100 μm segments
of the outer nuclear layer was performed in sections cut through the optic nerve at
500-μm steps from the optic nerve head. Tangential sectioning of flat-mounted
frozen retinas was performed as described in refs. 22,56.
Electroretinograms (ERGs). ERGs were recorded from dark-adapted mice as
described in refs. 40,57 using the Espion E2 system with a ColorDome ganzfeld
stimulator (Diagnosys LLC, Littleton, MA). Mice were anesthetized by an
intraperitoneal injection of 90 mg/kg ketamine and 9 mg/kg xylazine. Pupils were
dilated with a mixture of 1% cyclopentolate-HCl and 2.5% phenylephrine. Eyes
were kept lubricated during the recordings by a 1% carboxymethylellulose sodium
gel. Body temperature was maintained by a heated platform. Simultaneous
recording were made from both eyes using gold contact lens electrodes (Mayo
Corporation, Oasuka, Japan), with stainless steel needle electrodes (Ocuscience) in
the mouth (reference) and at the base of the tail (ground). ERG signals were
sampled at 1 kHz and recorded with 0.15 Hz low frequency and 500 Hz high
frequency cut-offs. Responses to flashes from 0.00025 cd/s/m2 to 500 cd/s/m2 with
averaged trials of 15 to 1 and inter-flash intervals of 5 s to 180 s. Data points from
the a-wave and b-wave stimulus-response curves were fitted by single or double
hyperbolic functions, respectively, using the least-square fitting procedure.
p-Values were calculated to determine the statistical significance between the
response amplitudes in P23H mice overexpressing PA28α or PSMD11 and control
P23H mice at each flash intensity using independent two-tailed t-tests in Prism
software (version 7.03).
Statistical methods. Data were analyzed using the Prizm GraphPad software.
p-Values were calculated using two-tailed homoscedastic t-test. Data are presented
as mean ± SEM, except for the spidergrams where data are presented as mean ± SD.
p-Values on the figures are indicated as follows: *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001,
****p < 0.0001, and n.s. for p > 0.05. No statistical methods were used to pre-
determine sample sizes, but sample sizes are similar to those used in previous
published studies. No data were excluded from the analysis. No randomization was
used and animal genotypes were not blinded.
Data availability. All relevant data are available on reasonable request from the
authors.
