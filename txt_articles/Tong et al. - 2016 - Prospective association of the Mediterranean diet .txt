Abstract
Background: Despite convincing evidence in the Mediterranean region, the cardiovascular benefit of the
Mediterranean diet is not well established in non-Mediterranean countries and the optimal criteria for defining
adherence are unclear. The population attributable fraction (PAF) of adherence to this diet is also unknown.
Methods: In the UK-based EPIC-Norfolk prospective cohort, we evaluated habitual diets assessed at baseline
(1993–1997) and during follow-up (1998–2000) using food-frequency questionnaires (n = 23,902). We estimated
a Mediterranean diet score (MDS) using cut-points projected from the Mediterranean dietary pyramid, and also
three other pre-existing MDSs. Using multivariable-adjusted Cox regression with repeated measures of MDS and
covariates, we examined prospective associations between each MDS with incident cardiovascular diseases (CVD)
by 2009 and mortality by 2013, and estimated PAF for each outcome attributable to low MDS.
Results: We observed 7606 incident CVD events (2818/100,000 person-years) and 1714 CVD deaths (448/100,000).
The MDS based on the Mediterranean dietary pyramid was significantly associated with lower incidence of the
cardiovascular outcomes, with hazard ratios (95 % confidence intervals) of 0.95 (0.92–0.97) per one standard
deviation for incident CVD and 0.91 (0.87–0.96) for CVD mortality. Associations were similar for composite
incident ischaemic heart disease and all-cause mortality. Other pre-existing MDSs showed similar, but more
modest associations. PAF due to low dietary pyramid based MDS (<95th percentile) was 3.9 % (1.3–6.5 %) for
total incident CVD and 12.5 % (4.5–20.6 %) for CVD mortality.
Conclusions: Greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet was associated with lower CVD incidence and
mortality in the UK. This diet has an important population health impact for the prevention of CVD.
Background
The Mediterranean diet describes the traditional diet of
Mediterranean regions such as Crete, other parts of
Greece and Southern Italy [1–3]. The diet is typically
high in the consumption of cereals, fruits, vegetables,
legumes and olive oil, low in red meats, and moderate in
the consumption of fermented dairy products, fish,
poultry and wine [2, 4]. Since its recognition, adherence
to the Mediterranean diet has been reported to be as-
sociated with lower incidence of non-communicable
diseases, including cardiovascular diseases (CVD), can-
cer, neurodegenerative diseases and mortality [5–9].
Results from two randomised controlled trials also
demonstrated the causal protective role of the diet in
high-risk populations [8–11].
Although studies on the potential cardiovascular ben-
efits of the Mediterranean diet have been published in
both Mediterranean and non-Mediterranean cohorts,

 evidence from non-Mediterranean regions is less con-
sistent. A Swedish cohort, for example, observed that
high adherence to the Mediterranean diet was associ-
ated with lower cardiovascular mortality only among
women [12], while in an Australian cohort, the associ-
ation was observed only among men [13]. An Eastern
European study also showed that high adherence to a
Mediterranean diet was associated with lower all cause
and CVD mortality, but not with ischaemic heart
disease (IHD) or stroke mortality [14]. In the United
Kingdom (UK), although the UK National Institute for
Health and Care Excellence recommends a Mediterranean
style diet for the secondary prevention of CVD, no
study in the country has examined the association of
adherence to the Mediterranean diet with incident
CVD [15].
Moreover, in assessing adherence to the Mediterranean
diet, published studies evaluated different Mediterranean
diet scores (MDSs) [16–21], but there is sparse evidence
on whether or not each algorithm would be useful in
non-Mediterranean countries. In addition, most pub-
lished MDSs did not take into account the current
recommendations
for
adopting
the
Mediterranean
diet [22]. Finally, the population impact of a cardio-
vascular benefit from adhering to the Mediterranean
diet at the general population level also remains un-
known, partly because the previous trials may have
limited generalisability by recruiting highly selected
adults only.
Therefore, we aimed to assess the association of the
Mediterranean diet as defined by different MDSs with
incident CVD, CVD mortality and all-cause mortality in a
UK-based
cohort,
and
to
estimate

population
attributable fraction (PAF) for cardiovascular and mortal-
ity outcomes for low adherence to the Mediterranean diet.
Methods
Study population and design
European Prospective Investigation of Cancer (EPIC)-
Norfolk is an ongoing UK-based prospective cohort
and part of the Europe-wide multi-centre EPIC study.
Details of the study design were described previously
[23]. Briefly, 25,639 men and women aged 40–79 in
eastern England were recruited through general prac-
tice registers and underwent baseline assessment be-
tween 1993 and 1997. Participants were further invited
to the follow-up assessment (1998 to 2000), and were
followed up by 2009 for incident outcomes and by 2013
for mortality. At the baseline and follow-up visits, the
participants were asked to complete a health and life-
style questionnaire and a food frequency questionnaire
(FFQ). We excluded 644 participants who did not
complete any FFQs. In the analysis for incident CVD,
we additionally excluded 1093 participants who reported
myocardial infarction (n = 790) or stroke (n = 303) at
baseline. This study thus evaluated 23,902 participants
(n = 11,258 with dietary data at both baseline and
follow-up, and n = 208 with dietary data at follow-up
only). Ethical approval for the study was obtained from
the Norwich District Ethics Committee and participants
gave informed consent.
Dietary assessment and Mediterranean diet scores (MDSs)
Habitual diet was assessed using a 130-item semi-
quantitative FFQ which asked about participants’ average
intake of the food items over the past year. Validity of
this FFQ for major foods and nutrients was previously
assessed against 16-day weighted dietary records, 24-
hour recall and selected biomarkers in the sub-sample of
EPIC-Norfolk [24–26]. Reproducibility of the assessment
of dietary components typical of the Mediterranean diet
and the MDSs were evaluated in this study. For MDS
calculation, we evaluated dietary intakes adjusted to a
2000 kcal/day (8.37 MJ/day) diet using the residual
method to assess diet quality independent of diet quan-
tity, and to partly reduce measurement errors because
energy intake is partly related to under- or over-
reporting of dietary consumption [27].
In this study, we evaluated four MDSs as measures of
adherence to the Mediterranean diet. The algorithm for
each is summarised in Additional file 1: Text S1 and Table
S1. As the primary exposure, we evaluated a MDS based
on the Mediterranean diet pyramid (pyramid-based
MDS, PyrMDS). The pyramid was recently proposed by
the Mediterranean Diet Foundation [4] to be applied to
both Mediterranean and non-Mediterranean regions,
with dietary guidelines accounting for the traditional
Mediterranean diet and also the contemporary food
environment [4]. We newly developed the algorithm to
calculate the PyrMDS (Additional file 1: Table S2). The
other three MDSs were identified through our system-
atic search for quantitative review articles published by
January 12, 2016, on the Mediterranean diet and non-
communicable diseases. We identified 254 unique records
and retrieved 31 full-text articles. An algorithm for one
MDS was recently developed by Sofi et al. [5] from their
review of published literature on the Mediterranean diet
(literature-based MDS, LitMDS). Whereas PyrMDS and
LitMDS account for absolute levels of dietary consump-
tion, the other two MDSs [17, 28], the most commonly
used MDSs in the literature, assigned component
scores based on cohort medians (mMDS) or tertiles of
dietary consumption (tMDS) (Additional file 1: Text S1
and Table S1).
Outcome ascertainment
The primary outcome was incident CVD, which in-
cluded any first ever case of both non-fatal or fatal

 events due to IHD, ischaemic stroke, haemorrhagic
stroke, heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, or
other cardiovascular outcomes described by the rele-
vant ICD codes (ICD9 401–448 or ICD10 I10–I79)
[29]. Cause-specific hospital admission was determined
using East Norfolk Commission Record of the National
Health Service [29, 30]. Incident CVD was ascertained
until March 31, 2009. CVD mortality and all-cause
mortality, treated as a secondary outcome in this study,
was confirmed via death certificates with ICD codes
held at the UK Office for National Statistics and ascer-
tained until June 30, 2013 [29, 30].
Assessment of other covariates
Demographic, lifestyle and health characteristics were
assessed
at
baseline
and
follow-up
using
a
self-
administered questionnaire. Physical activity levels were
self-reported and characterised as a validated 4-point
index [31]. Trained nurses measured each participant’s
weight, height, waist circumference and blood pressure
(systolic and diastolic) at each visit, and took non-
fasting bloods from which blood lipids were assayed.
Statistical analyses
Linear regression was used for descriptive analyses of
associations between the MDSs and cohort baseline
characteristics. Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients
were assessed to examine reproducibility over time for
MDSs and relevant dietary factors. In longitudinal ana-
lysis, repeated measures of diet and covariates were
used, wherever possible, through the cumulative-average
method [27]. We modelled Cox proportional-hazards re-
gression to estimate hazard ratio (HR) and 95 % confi-
dence interval (CI) for each of the selected outcomes.
The underlying time variable was age from the first
available FFQ to age at diagnosis of CVD (or death for
mortality outcomes), or the date of administrative cen-
soring, whichever occurred first. Each of the four MDSs
was modelled continuously per standard deviation (SD)
and categorically (three groups: low, medium or high
adherence) with approximately equal numbers of par-
ticipants in each group. Analyses were adjusted for
potential confounders, and additionally for potential
physiological mediators. Variables considered as poten-
tial confounders were age, sex, education level, social
class, marital status, smoking, physical activity, season
of FFQ assessment, body mass index (BMI), waist cir-
cumference, prevalent diabetes, medication use (anti-
hypertensive drugs, lipid-lowering drugs, and hormone
replacement therapy for women), and family history of
diseases (diabetes, myocardial infarction and stroke).
Potential mediators included total cholesterol, high-
density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein
cholesterol, log triglycerides, and systolic and diastolic
blood pressure. The proportional hazard assumption
for MDSs was not rejected on the basis of Schoenfeld
residuals in multivariable-adjusted Cox model. We per-
formed additional analyses modelling two MDSs simul-
taneously to test if one of the MDSs was more strongly
associated with CVD than the other. Missing covariates
were observed in ≤ 3.9 % of participants for socioeco-
nomic and lifestyle variables (3.9 % for social class and
< 1.4 % for the others), and in ≤ 9.6 % of participants for
physiological markers (9.6 % for blood lipids, 0.2 % for
blood pressure or anthropometry). The missing infor-
mation was imputed simultaneously by conducting
regression-based multiple imputation (n = 10). In all
analyses unless specified, estimates from 10 datasets
were pooled under Rubin’s rules [32].
We estimated PAFs for each outcome attributable to
low Mediterranean diet adherence, for which we as-
sumed the observed associations were causal. Results
based on PyrMDS are presented in this report account-
ing for its strongest public-health importance based on
the longitudinal analyses. We calculated PAF based on
the formula of rate difference [33]: PAF = (I0 − Ii)/I0,
equivalent to I0 − HR × dMDS/I0, where HR was estimated
continuously with adjustment for potential confounders
as aforementioned, I0 is observed incidence per 10,000
person-years, and Ii represents a hypothetical, ideal inci-
dence if the population achieved high MDS (95th percent-
ile) (dMDS = MDSideal – MDSobserved). The CI of the PAF
was derived from bootstrapping [34] to estimate HR and
PAF iteratively (n resampling = 100, after confirming no
difference in results between n = 100 and 1000). In
addition, we repeated estimation of PAFs in a high-risk
population only. A high risk was defined as having a 10-
year CVD risk of 10 % or higher based on QRISK2 [35],
by which a clinical intervention is recommended in the
UK [36].
In analysis of any dietary scores, an observed associ-
ation with a health outcome can be driven by one com-
ponent of the score. To rule out this possibility and
assess importance of combining multiple dietary com-
ponents, we repeated the primary analysis for each
MDS after sequentially excluding each Mediterranean
diet component from the total score. Other sensitivity
analyses include using FFQ assessed at baseline only
without use of repeated measures of diet; including
only participants who completed both FFQs and using
repeated measures only; excluding participants with po-
tential implausible energy intakes (extreme 1st or 5th per-
centile); and adjusting for censoring due to competing
risks of non-CVD mortality [37]. We also repeated ana-
lyses by re-constructing MDSs by grouping food items
differently to consider variations of the Mediterranean diet
[2, 4], for example by including only wine in the alcohol
component. To assess whether the association of MDSs
Tong et al. BMC Medicine  (2016) 14:135 
Page 3 of 11
 with outcomes was independent of baseline risk of CVDs,
we also additionally adjusted for QRISK2 as a covariate.
All analyses were performed using Stata version 13.1
(Stata Corp, Texas, United States) and P values of < 0.05
were considered significant.
Results
Cohort characteristics
Associations of adherence to the Mediterranean diet as
defined by the four MDSs with baseline characteristics
(sociodemographic, anthropometric, health and life-
style) were similar across the scores (Table 1). Partici-
pants with high adherence were less likely to be current
smokers, and more likely to be physically active and
have a college education and higher social status com-
pared to participants with low adherence. The primary
MDS,
PyrMDS,
was
moderately
reproducible
over
3.7 years (Spearman’s ρ = 0.60) (Additional file 1: Table
S3) and correlated with the other MDSs (ρ = 0.53 with
mMDS to ρ = 0.81 with tMDS). The Mediterranean diet
components showed moderate reproducibility (ρ = 0.47
to 0.85 over).
Association of adherence to the Mediterranean diet with
incident CVD and mortality
Of 23,902 participants, 7606 developed primary incident
CVD (non-fatal or fatal) over 269,935 person-years
(12.2 years of follow-up on average). A total of 5660
participants died over 382,765 person-years (17.0 years of
follow-up on average), among whom 1714 deaths were
due to CVD. Greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet
was significantly associated with lower incidence of CVD
in different multivariable-adjusted models (Table 2). For
example, after adjustment for potential confounders,
the HR per SD difference in PyrMDS was 0.95 (95 %
CI, 0.93–0.97). The LitMDS and tMDS showed similar
results, with an HR of 0.96 (95 % CI, 0.94–0.97) and
0.97 (95 % CI, 0.94–0.99), respectively, whereas mMDS
was not significantly associated with incident CVD in
any models (P trend > 0.05). Similar trends were ob-
served when we additionally examined the HRs for
quintiles of each MDS (Additional file 1: Table S4). In
exploratory analyses comparing the four MDSs for pre-
diction of CVD, PyrMDS, LitMDS and tMDS appeared
similarly predictive of CVD, but superior to mMDS
(Additional file 1: Table S5).
When we examined the association of adherence to
the Mediterranean diet with subtypes of primary CVD
events (i.e. IHD and stroke separately) and cause-specific
and all-cause mortality (Fig. 1), the trends in magnitude
of associations were similar to that for all incident CVD.
Overall, PyrMDS was associated with lower hazard of
most outcomes examined. Per SD difference in PyrMDS,
we observed a lower incidence of all-cause mortality
(HR adjusted for potential confounders 0.95; 95 % CI,
0.93–0.98), CVD mortality (0.91; 0.87–0.96), incident
IHD (0.94; 0.90–0.98), incident stroke (0.93; 0.87–0.99),
incident composite IHD or stroke (0.93; 0.90–0.97), IHD
mortality (0.90; 0.83–0.97), and composite IHD or stroke
mortality (0.92; 0.87–0.97), but no significant association
for stroke mortality (0.96; 0.87–1.05).
Population attributable fraction
In the EPIC-Norfolk population, 3.9 % (95 % CI, 1.3–6.5 %)
of total CVD was estimated to be attributable to low
Mediterranean diet adherence (PyrMDS lower than its 95th
percentile, 10.7 of 15 points) (Table 3). This was equivalent
to 9.7 cases of total CVD preventable per 1000 population
over 10 years. If considering incident IHD or stroke events,
the PAF estimate was 8.5 % (3.1, 13.9 %), equivalent to 10.2
IHD or stroke cases preventable per 1000 population. For
CVD mortality and all-cause mortality, PAFs in the whole
cohort were 12.5 % (4.5, 20.6 %) and 5.4 % (1.3, 9.5 %),
equivalent to 5.5 and 7.5 cases per 1000 population over
10 years, respectively. Amongst a high-risk population
(QRISK2 score ≥ 10 %) (n = 15767), the corresponding PAF
(95 % CI) for total incident CVD was 3.9 % (1.1, 6.7 %),
equivalent to 13.0 cases preventable per 1000 population
over 10 years. Estimates for adherence to PyrMDS lower
than the top third, or 67th percentile (scoring 9.1 points out
of 15) among the EPIC-Norfolk population were of a
comparable magnitude (Additional file 1: Table S6).
Sensitivity analyses
In analyses using MDSs in which each Mediterranean diet
component was sequentially excluded, significant inverse
associations remained reasonably stable regardless of the
excluded component, especially when adherence was
assessed using either PyrMDS or LitMDS (Additional file
1: Figure S1). Results were also similar in analyses using
baseline FFQ only, using averages of the two FFQs from
follow-up onwards only, excluding outliers of total energy
intake, or controlling for competing risks due to non-
CVD mortality (Additional file 1: Table S7). The associ-
ation was also unchanged when we modified food group-
ings, excluding non-fermented dairy products, processed
fish, refined cereal products, and alcohol other than wine,
or when we additionally adjusted for QRISK2.
Discussion
Our study is the first report on the association of prede-
fined Mediterranean diet adherence with CVD in a UK
general population setting. In this UK cohort, overall, we
observed an inverse association of adherence to the
Mediterranean diet with incident CVD and all-cause
mortality. Our findings suggest that the MDS based on
the Mediterranean dietary pyramid had the strongest
associations with cardiovascular outcomes. Moreover,

 we report that other scoring algorithms of the Mediterranean
diet that are based on dietary cut-offs in prior literature
and on cohort tertiles may also be useful in the UK
population. We further estimated that 3.9 % of total
CVD incidence, 8.5 % of IHD or stroke incidence, and
12.5 % of CVD mortality in the EPIC-Norfolk cohort
could have been avoided by increasing adherence to the
Mediterranean diet. The findings indicate that adherence
to the Mediterranean diet may contribute to a strategy for
the primary prevention of CVD in the UK.

 CVD mortality, and all-cause mortality observed in EPIC-
Norfolk is broadly in line with other published studies on
the Mediterranean diet and CVD [11, 14, 38–44]. Specific-
ally in the UK context, the Whitehall II study (n = 7731)
concluded
potential
cardio-metabolic
benefits
of
a
Mediterranean-like diet for British adults, but did not find
any significant associations after adjustment for con-
founders and did not assess the Mediterranean diet per se,
by inferring the diet based on data-driven cluster analysis
[45]. A few other studies in non-Mediterranean countries
examined the association of pre-defined Mediterranean
diet with CVD [12–14, 41–43, 46]. While their findings
were broadly consistent with our findings, estimates of
associations were often imprecise with wide confidence
intervals or were non-significant. Exceptionally, one
recent US study based on a large multi-ethnic cohort
(n = 215,782) found that mMDS was associated with 11
to 28 % lower CVD mortality [43]. Based on our find-
ings evaluating different MDSs, the inverse association
could be stronger, if the study evaluated the other MDSs
better suited to a non-Mediterranean population than
mMDS. However, compared to studies conducted in
Mediterranean cohorts [40, 47, 48], our estimates appear
modest, which could be reflective of the fact that high
adherence to a Mediterranean diet in this UK cohort
might still not be fully representative of a traditional
Mediterranean diet, as might be observed in the
Mediterranean regions.
PAF was not estimated from any prior prospective stud-
ies, but can be manually calculated in the PREDIMED trial
for incidence of either IHD or stroke [11]. The control
group of this high-risk trial in Spain had an incidence of
the composite outcome of 11.2 per 1000 person-years,
similar to the incidence of our overall cohort (12.0 per
1000 person-years). According to effect estimates reported
in the publication, the PAF for the outcome for no inter-
vention in the PREDIMED trial was estimated to be
27.8 %, whereas PAF in the EPIC-Norfolk cohort for
suboptimal adherence to PyrMDS was 8.5 %. The corre-
sponding number of cases preventable and the number
needed to treat over 10 years of follow-up were estimated
to be 28.5 per 1000 population and 35.1, respectively, in
PREDIMED and 9.2 per 1000 and 108.9, respectively, in
EPIC-Norfolk.
One possible explanation for this discrepancy in these
measures between PREDIMED and EPIC-Norfolk could
be bias toward the null in the EPIC-Norfolk cohort,
because of measurement errors and temporal changes in
diet. Moreover, despite the inverse association with CVD
incidence, the variability of adherence to the Mediterra-
nean diet might not fully capture a high-quality diet in
the UK. Indeed, none of the participants recorded the
optimal score of PyrMDS (the observed highest = 13.1;
the possible highest = 15.0). Alternatively, as mentioned
above, the difference could reflect that the PREDIMED
trial compared the Mediterranean diet against a non-
Mediterranean diet, whereas EPIC-Norfolk tested a diet
not fully in line with the Mediterranean diet.
Interpretation of results and implications
Evidence from the Lyon Diet Heart Study in France and
the more recent PREDIMED trial in Spain supports the
causal effect of adherence to the Mediterranean diet on
CVD outcomes [10, 11, 49, 50]. The PAF estimates in
EPIC-Norfolk suggest that 1 to 6 % of all CVD, and 2 to
14 % of IHD or stroke incidence could be avoided by ad-
hering to the Mediterranean diet in both a general popu-
lation and a high-risk population, defined by QRISK2,
for whom statin prescription would be recommended in
the UK [36]. Of note, statin treatment could prevent
24 % of new-onset CVD, according to trials in the UK
[51]. However, while statins do not influence other out-
comes or may even increase risk of diabetes [52], greater
adherence to the Mediterranean diet by contrast may
have benefits beyond prevention of CVD. Our estimates
are comparable to the corresponding PAF estimates for
physical inactivity, which were 5.8 % for IHD mortality
and 9.4 % for all-cause mortality [53].
While an alternative healthy dietary pattern beyond the
Mediterranean diet may exist due to cultural differences,
our PAF estimates indicate that the Mediterranean diet
should be one option for a healthy diet in the UK,
where CVD accounts for approximately 155,000 deaths,
or more than a quarter of all deaths each year, and as-
sociated healthcare costs are estimated to be £11 billion
per year and increasing [54]. If we assume causality and
generalizability of our findings to the general UK popu-
lation, a PAF of 12.5 % would have equated to 19,375
cases of CVD deaths preventable each year. Further inves-
tigation is warranted to explore the effectiveness of a
population-level recommendation and cost-effectiveness
of the Mediterranean diet in the UK and other non-
Mediterranean countries, as a component of lifestyle
recommendations for both the general and high CVD risk
populations.
The use of FFQ as the dietary assessment instrument
in our study limits the ability to precisely measure ad-
herence to the Mediterranean diet, as it did not differen-
tiate between extra virgin olive oil and other olive oils or
between tree nuts (legumes) and peanuts, as evaluated
in the PREDIMED trial [4]. Nonetheless, this study indi-
cates utility of three scoring algorithms for the MDS:
PyrMDS, LitMDS and tMDS, to represent adherence to
a Mediterranean-style dietary pattern in epidemiological
settings. Of note, findings are similar upon alternative
categorisations of food groups for the MDSs, and upon
other sensitivity analyses (Additional file 1: Table S7).
Our findings indicate that using sex-specific medians
Tong et al. BMC Medicine  (2016) 14:135 
Page 8 of 11
 (mMDS) in a given population would be too crude and
not sensitive enough to assess adherence to the diet in a
non-Mediterranean country. On the other hand, PyrMDS
and LitMDS may deserve future investigation for clinical
application, as they allowed calculation of MDS without
use of reference population levels (e.g. medians or tertiles)
[5]. PyrMDS is likely to be better than the others because
the scoring accounts for the continuous property of diet-
ary consumption, for the contemporary food environment
distinguishing between processed and unprocessed meat,
and for available evidence from epidemiological studies by
encouraging moderate consumption of fermented dairy
products, as originally characterised by the Mediterranean
diet [2, 55, 56]; of note, dairy consumption was considered
as an adverse component in mMDS and tMDS. Our find-
ings guide further studies to investigate the utility of the
Mediterranean dietary pyramid (and PyrMDS) for clinical
practice and public health promotion in both Mediterranean
and non-Mediterranean populations.
Strengths and limitations
These results are of interest as the first to extensively
examine the association of the Mediterranean diet with
CVD in the UK and estimate the population impact of in-
creasing adherence. Evaluation of four different MDSs
clarified the difference between their characteristics and
their utility in a non-Mediterranean context. A strength of
this study is that it included a large sample size with long
follow-up time. Because outcome ascertainment in this
cohort was externally linked to medical records, it also
minimised bias that could arise during follow-up. As
limitations, measurement errors were present in our self-
reported dietary and covariate measurements, and we
could not fully account for changes in diet throughout the
study period, although the errors were reduced by using
repeated measures of diet, as well as time-varying co-
variates [27, 46]. We considered BMI as a confounder
in our analyses, although recent evidence suggests po-
tential mediating effects of BMI in the diet CVD associ-
ation [57], and this could lead to underestimation of
our effect estimates. However, this is unlikely given the
consistency of our estimates across the levels of adjust-
ment. Residual confounding is possible, because of un-
measured confounders and imprecise measurement of
potential confounders. Generalisability is limited because
of potential healthy cohort bias [23], dietary measures col-
lected more than 15 years ago, and inclusion of largely
white European individuals in the UK.
Conclusions
We observed a lower incidence of CVD with higher
adherence to the Mediterranean diet in this UK cohort.
Our study also informs potential population impact of
increasing adherence to the Mediterranean diet in a UK
population. These results add to the pool of evidence on
the health benefits of the Mediterranean diet, even in a
non-Mediterranean country where an optimal dietary
pattern is unknown. Our findings stimulate future
population-based and clinical investigations into the effi-
cacy and effectiveness of adhering to the Mediterranean
diet in contemporary, non-Mediterranean populations.
