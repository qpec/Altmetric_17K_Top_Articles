Summary
Background Ovarian cancer has a poor prognosis, with just 40% of patients surviving 5 years. We designed this trial 
to establish the eff
 ect of early detection by screening on ovarian cancer mortality.
Methods In this randomised controlled trial, we recruited postmenopausal women aged 50–74 years from 13 centres in 
National Health Service Trusts in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Exclusion criteria were previous bilateral 
oophorectomy or ovarian malignancy, increased risk of familial ovarian cancer, and active non-ovarian malignancy. The 
trial management system confi
 rmed eligibility and randomly allocated participants in blocks of 32 using computer-
generated random numbers to annual multimodal screening (MMS) with serum CA125 interpreted with use of the risk 
of ovarian cancer algorithm, annual transvaginal ultrasound screening (USS), or no screening, in a 1:1:2 ratio. The 
primary outcome was death due to ovarian cancer by Dec 31, 2014, comparing MMS and USS separately with no 
screening, ascertained by an outcomes committee masked to randomisation group. All analyses were by modifi
 ed 
intention to screen, excluding the small number of women we discovered after randomisation to have a bilateral 
oophorectomy, have ovarian cancer, or had exited the registry before recruitment. Investigators and participants were 
aware of screening type. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00058032.
Findings Between June 1, 2001, and Oct 21, 2005, we randomly allocated 202 638 women: 50 640 (25·0%) to MMS, 
50 639 (25·0%) to USS, and 101 359 (50·0%) to no screening. 202 546 (>99·9%) women were eligible for analysis: 
50 624 (>99·9%) women in the MMS group, 50 623 (>99·9%) in the USS group, and 101 299 (>99·9%) in the no 
screening group. Screening ended on Dec 31, 2011, and included 345 570 MMS and 327 775 USS annual screening 
episodes. At a median follow-up of 11·1 years (IQR 10·0–12·0), we diagnosed ovarian cancer in 1282 (0·6%) women: 
338 (0·7%) in the MMS group, 314 (0·6%) in the USS group, and 630 (0·6%) in the no screening group. Of these 
women, 148 (0·29%) women in the MMS group, 154 (0·30%) in the USS group, and 347 (0·34%) in the no screening 
group had died of ovarian cancer. The primary analysis using a Cox proportional hazards model gave a mortality 
reduction over years 0–14 of 15% (95% CI –3 to 30; p=0·10) with MMS and 11% (–7 to 27; p=0·21) with USS. The 
Royston-Parmar fl
 exible parametric model showed that in the MMS group, this mortality eff
 ect was made up of 8% 
(–20 to 31) in years 0–7 and 23% (1–46) in years 7–14, and in the USS group, of 2% (–27 to 26) in years 0–7 and 21% 
(–2 to 42) in years 7–14. A prespecifi
 ed analysis of death from ovarian cancer of MMS versus no screening with exclusion 
of prevalent cases showed signifi
 cantly diff
 erent death rates (p=0·021), with an overall average mortality reduction of 
20% (–2 to 40) and a reduction of 8% (–27 to 43) in years 0–7 and 28% (–3 to 49) in years 7–14 in favour of MMS.
Interpretation Although the mortality reduction was not signifi
 cant in the primary analysis, we noted a signifi
 cant 
mortality reduction with MMS when prevalent cases were excluded. We noted encouraging evidence of a mortality 
reduction in years 7–14, but further follow-up is needed before fi
 rm conclusions can be reached on the effi
  cacy and 
cost-eff
 ectiveness of ovarian cancer screening.

(ROCA) for interpretation of longitudinal CA125,6,7 use of 
morphological criteria in second-line transvaginal ultra-
sound,8 and use of ROCA in a pilot randomised controlled 
trial.9 During this period, advances in treatment have only 
produced a slight reduction in disease mortality.10,11
This research led us in 2001 to undertake a defi
 nitive 
randomised controlled trial, the UK Collaborative Trial of 
Ovarian Cancer Screening (UKCTOCS), of more than 
200 000 women.12 The primary aim was to assess the eff
 ect 
of screening on disease mortality. We have previously 
reported on performance characteristics of screening,13,14 
harms related to false-positive surgery,13,14 and the psycho-
logical morbidity associated with screening.15 This report 
is a key landmark for the programme, providing the fi
 rst 
ovarian cancer mortality data from UKCTOCS.
Methods
Study design and participants
In this randomised controlled trial, we recruited women 
through 13 regional centres (RCs) in National Health 
Service (NHS) Trusts in England, Wales, and Northern 
Ireland, with the Queen Mary University of London as the 
coordinating centre (CC) between 2001 and 2004 and then 
University College London from 2004 onwards. We invited 
women identifi
 ed through the age-sex registers of 
27 participating primary care trusts within the RC 
catchment areas. We commissioned specialised software 
from the NHS to randomly select women aged 50–74 years 
and then fl
 ag them on primary care trusts’ registers and 
allow electronic transfer of their personal and general 
practice details to the CC in lots of 5000 to 10 000 every 
quarter. We then sent women personal invitations and 
logged replies on the trial management system. Women 
attended a recruitment clinic at the RC where they viewed 
an information video, completed a recruitment question-
naire, and provided written consent and a baseline serum 
sample. We scanned recruitment questionnaires at the CC 
into a bespoke trial management system.12 Eligibility 
criteria were 50–74 years of age and postmenopausal status. 
Exclusion criteria were self-reported previous bilateral 
oophorectomy or ovarian malignancy, increased risk of 
familial ovarian cancer, or active non-ovarian malignancy. 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
During the 1990s, fi
 ndings from large prospective studies of 
screening showed that both CA125 and ultrasound-based 
ovarian cancer screening could identify preclinical cases of 
ovarian cancer. These studies included some by our own group 
with use of a multimodal strategy incorporating CA125 with 
ultrasound as a secondary test. In the year before the start of this 
trial, a systematic review of 25 ovarian cancer screening studies 
commissioned by the National Health Service Health Technology 
Assessment Programme reported that although ultrasound and 
multimodal screening can detect ovarian cancer in 
asymptomatic women, the eff
 ect of screening on ovarian cancer 
was unproven. The authors concluded that screening should not 
be introduced into clinical practice until further information was 
available from randomised trials designed to assess the eff
 ect of 
ovarian cancer screening on mortality and its adverse eff
 ects and 
cost-eff
 ectiveness. After that publication, our group reported the 
fi
 ndings of a pilot randomised controlled trial in 
22 000 postmenopausal women showing the feasibility of 
ovarian cancer screening with use of a multimodal screening 
strategy and provided preliminary evidence of a survival benefi
 t 
in this population. During this trial, two large randomised 
controlled trials were done: the Shizuoka Cohort Study of Ovarian 
Cancer Screening and the ovarian component of the Prostate 
Lung Colorectal Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial. The 
Shizuoka Cohort Study of Ovarian Cancer Screening only 
reported on ovarian cancer detection and not on deaths. 
Findings from the ovarian component of the PLCO Cancer 
Screening Trial showed no diff
 erence in ovarian cancer deaths 
between the screening and control groups. We searched 
MEDLINE between Jan 1, 2001, and Nov 31, 2015, using the 
protocol described by Mosch and colleagues, with the following 
search terms: “ovarian neoplasms”, “Fallopian tube neoplasms”, 
“ovar*”, “fallopian tub* OR adnex*”, “tumo*”, “malignan*”, 
“carcinoma* OR adenocarcinoma* OR neoplasm* OR mass*”, 
“mass screening”, “early detection of cancer”, “randomized 
controlled trial”, “controlled clinical trial”, “randomized”, 
“placebo”, “clinical trials”, “randomly”, and “trial”. This search 
yielded 234 publications, which, when limited to randomised 
controlled trials of human female adults published in the English 
language resulted in 64 articles, 11 of which were duplicated. The 
remaining 53 articles consisted of 28 pertaining to the PLCO 
Cancer Screening Trial, 11 from our own group, and one from 
Kobayashi and colleagues in 2008 (the Shizuoka Cohort Study of 
Ovarian Cancer Screening). We identifi
 ed three key randomised 
controlled trials in ovarian cancer screening. Of these, only the 
PLCO Cancer Screening Trial thus far has reported mortality data.
Added value of this study
To our knowledge, this trial is the fi
 rst randomised controlled trial 
of ovarian cancer screening to produce fi
 ndings that show that in 
postmenopausal women from the general population, annual 
screening with use of the multimodal strategy is safe and could 
reduce deaths due to ovarian cancer. These fi
 ndings are derived 
from one of the largest randomised trials ever done and renew 
hope that death rates from the most lethal of all gynaecological 
malignancies can be reduced through early detection.
Implications of all the available evidence
Our fi
 ndings suggest that a multimodal approach to screening 
might detect ovarian cancer suffi
  ciently early to reduce 
mortality. To establish the magnitude of this reduction in 
deaths, a longer duration of follow-up is needed. Meanwhile, 
eff
 orts to refi
 ne ovarian cancer screening strategies should 
continue.

The trial design has been previously published12–14 and 
the protocol is available online. Ethical approval was by 
the UK North West Multicentre Research Ethics 
Committees (North West MREC 00/8/34).
Randomisation and masking
The trial management system confi
 rmed eligibility and 
then randomly allocated women to annual screening 
using a multimodal screening (MMS) or ultrasound 
screening (USS) strategy or no screening in a 1:1:2 ratio. 
The randomisation was accomplished using the Visual 
Basic randomisation statement and the Rnd function. The 
trial management system allocated a set of 32 random 
numbers to each RC, of which eight were allocated to 
MMS, eight to USS, and the remaining 16 to no screening. 
We randomly allocated each successive volunteer within 
the RC to one of the numbers and subsequently randomly 
allocated them into a group. Investigators and participants 
were aware of screening type, but the outcomes committee 
was masked.
Procedures
Annual screening in the MMS group used serum CA125 
concentration testing, with the pattern over time 
interpreted with use of the risk of ovarian cancer 
calculation, which identifi
 es signifi
 cant rises in CA125 
concentration above baseline.6,7,9 Next, ROCA triaged 
women to normal (annual screening), intermediate 
(repeat CA125 concentration testing in 3 months), and 
elevated (repeat CA125 concentration testing and 
transvaginal USS as a second-line test in 6 weeks) risk. 
Annual screening in the USS group used transvaginal 
USS as the primary test, which was classifi
 ed as normal 
(annual screening), unsatisfactory (repeat in 3 months), 
or abnormal (scan with a senior ultrasonographer within 
6 weeks).13 In both groups, women with persistent 
abnormalities had clinical assessment and additional 
investigations within the NHS by a trial clinician.13,14 We 
deemed women who had surgery or a biopsy for suspected 
ovarian cancer after clinical assessment screen positive.13,14
Screening was implemented centrally by the CC using a 
web-based trial management system, which ensured that 
protocol deviations were kept to a minimum.12 A quality 
assurance 
programme 
for 
transvaginal 
USS 
and 
accreditation for scanning of postmenopausal ovaries was 
overseen by the ultrasound committee.16 We linked women 
using their NHS number in England and Wales to the 
Health and Social Care Information Centre for cancer and 
death registrations and, in Northern Ireland, to the Central 
Services Agency and Northern Ireland Cancer Registry. For 
women from English RCs, we also obtained data for cancer 
diagnosis from the National Cancer Intelligence Network, 
and between April, 2001, and March, 2010, Hospital 
Episodes Statistics administrative records. Other sources 
were two postal follow-up questionnaires (3–5 years after 
randomisation and April, 2014) and direct communication 
from trial participants, their families, and physicians.
We interrogated all available data sources to identify 
women diagnosed after randomisation with any of 
19 International Classifi
 cation of Diseases (ICD)-10 
codes (appendix p 3).14 We retrieved copies of medical 
notes for all except those with ICD-10 C80 (malignant 
neoplasm of uncertain origin) who also had another 
specifi
 c non-ovarian or non-peritoneal cancer regis-
tration (appendix p 25). All were reviewed by an 
outcomes review committee (two pathologists and two 
gynaecological oncologists) who were masked to the 
randomisation group. We used an algorithm to assign 
the fi
 nal diagnosis. We based death due to ovarian 
cancer on disease progression (appearance of new 
lesions or increases in size of previously documented 
lesions with imaging, clinical worsening, or rising 
biomarker concentrations). We ascertained ovarian and 
adnexal surgery outside of the trial after randomisation 
through both self-reporting and Hospital Episodes 
Statistics records. 
We also ascertained contamination in the no 
screening group. This contamination was based on 
self-reporting in the 2014 follow-up questionnaire in 
which women in the no screening group were asked 
whether they had had ovarian cancer screening after 
recruitment.
The original trial protocol specifi
 ed six annual screens 
and follow-up for 7 years from randomisation.12 In 2008, 
an analysis of overall and cause-specifi
 c standardised 
mortality in the no screening group showed a lower 
than expected mortality rate. We therefore extended 
screening in the USS and MMS groups to Dec 31, 2011, 
resulting in women being off
 ered 7–11 screens 
depending on the year of randomisation. Follow-up was 
extended to Dec 31, 2014.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was ovarian cancer death by 
Dec 31, 2014, assessed with use of data from the sources 
described above. Ovarian cancer refers to malignant 
neoplasms of the ovary (ICD-10 C56), which include 
primary 
non-epithelial 
ovarian 
cancer, 
borderline 
epithelial ovarian cancer, and invasive epithelial ovarian 
cancer; malignant neoplasms of the fallopian tube 
(ICD-10 C57
.0); and undesignated malignancies of the 
ovaries, fallopian tube, or peritoneum.17 It does not 
include primary peritoneal cancer, which was diagnosed 
on the basis of WHO 2003 criteria.18
A secondary outcome was death due to ovarian and 
primary peritoneal cancer (ICD-10 C48.1 and C48.2). 
Most peritoneal cancers are likely to be classifi
 ed as tubal 
and ovarian cancer once wider acceptance of the WHO 
2014 revision has occurred.19 Another secondary outcome 
was compliance with screening, which was the 
proportion of women who attended all tests that consisted 
of a screening episode out of the total who were eligible 
for that screening episode. A further secondary outcome 
was complications related to screening and false-positive

surgery. Centres reported screening-related compli-
cations to a designated safety offi
  cer. We deemed screen-
positive surgery resulting in benign pathology or normal 
adnexa false positive. Medical notes were centrally 
reviewed for complications, which were classifi
 ed as 
major (resulting in sequelae) or minor by a designated 
gynaecological oncologist. Other secondary outcomes 
were to assess and compare the performance charac-
teristics of the two screening strategies, assess the 
psychological eff
 ects of screening, and establish the 
resource implications of screening. 
Statistical analysis
In 2000, we estimated that a sample size of 200 000 women 
at a two-sided 5% signifi
 cance level for a diff
 erence in 
relative ovarian cancer mortality of 30% would give 90% 
power for the no screening versus combined screening 
groups and 80% power for the no screening versus MMS 
or no screening versus USS comparisons. After trial 
extension to Dec 31, 2014, our recalculated power 
remained 80% at a two-sided 5% signifi
 cance level to 
detect a reduction of 30% in no screening versus MMS or 
no screening versus USS comparisons.

The primary mortality analysis was an MMS versus no 
screening and USS versus no screening analysis of the 
primary outcome with use of a Cox proportional hazards 
model. The primary analysis initially consisted of 
comparison of the combined MMS and USS with the no 
screening group and individual comparisons of MMS 
with no screening and USS with no screening. The 
assumption was that sensitivity of the two screening 
strategies would be similar. During the trial, the data 
monitoring and ethics committee concluded that this 
assumption was not the case. On the basis of diff
 erences 
in performance characteristics of the two strategies at the 
initial screen,13 we updated our primary statistical ana-
lysis to MMS versus no screening and USS versus no 
screening comparisons. We defi
 ned survival time from 
date of randomisation to date of death due to ovarian 
cancer or censorship, or sooner if the volunteer died of 
another cause or was lost to follow-up. To allow for the 
fact that we were comparing two intervention arms 
against a control group, we made a Dunnett correction 
for multiple testing against a control to the critical α 
(α=0·0258). Mortality reduction estimates are 1 – hazard 
ratio (HR) estimates.
Early detection is likely to have less eff
 ect on women 
with ovarian cancer before screening starts (prevalent 
cases) than on those who develop it after the start of 
screening. The typical CA125 concentration profi
 le noted 
before diagnosis in ovarian cancer cases is a baseline 
level, a change point, and then a rising CA125 con-
centration (appendix pp 10, 25).14 We did a prespecifi
 ed 
MMS versus no screening subgroup analysis excluding 
prevalent cases for which the estimated change point was 
before randomisation, showing that the cancer was 
present before screening began (appendix pp 10, 24). For 
the prespecifi
 ed MMS versus no screening and USS 
versus no screening secondary outcome analysis of 
ovarian and peritoneal cancer deaths, we used a Cox 
proportional hazards model, Royston-Parmar (RP) 
model, and post-hoc weighted log-rank (WLR) test.
In the original statistical plan, we did not make provision 
for the delayed eff
 ect on mortality that has been reported 
in other screening trials.20–23 The delayed eff
 ect is due to the 
inherent delay from randomisation to diagnosis and then 
death. Other cancer screening trials, including the Prostate 
Lung Colorectal Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial24–27 
and the National Lung Screening Trial,28 used a WLR test 
for the primary analysis to address this delay.29,30 In view of 
the precedent of the PLCO Cancer Screening Trial 
screening trial, we did a sole post-hoc WLR analysis for the 
primary outcome, applying the WLR test with the same 
choice of weights proportional to pooled ovarian cancer 
mortality (appendix p 11) as that used in the primary PLCO 
Cancer Screening Trial analysis.24 We applied the pre-
specifi
 ed RP method31 that can model proportional and 
non-proportional hazards due to delayed eff
 ects22,23 to 
investigate the hazard functions for each group. We 
estimated changing HRs across time32 and calculated 
average HRs for a split midway between the fi
 rst (0–7) and 
second (7–14) 7 years to summarise delayed eff
 ects.
We calculated the preliminary number needed to 
screen to prevent one death from ovarian cancer as the 
reciprocal of the absolute diff
 erence in cumulative 
mortality from ovarian cancer between the MMS and no 
screening groups. We calculated prespecifi
 ed ovarian 
cancer survival in the no screening group from date of 
diagnosis to explore external validity by comparison with 
UK ovarian cancer survival statistics. In addition to 
non-parametric Kaplan-Meier plots, we investigated the 
underlying ovarian cancer incidence (hazard) rates for 
each group with RP models.
We did sensitivity analyses using both a prespecifi
 ed 
Cox proportional hazards model and the post-hoc WLR to 
establish the robustness of the primary analysis. We did a 
data source analysis restricting the outcome to events that 
had a national cancer registration or death certifi
 cation to 
address the possibility of under-reporting in the no 
screening group. We also did potential within-centre 
correlation analyses by stratifying the model by centre and 
using cluster-robust SEs. Finally, we did competing-risk

analysis that treats other deaths as a competing risk rather 
than a censoring event. We also treated bilateral salpingo-
oophorectomy done in women both within and outside of 
the trial as a competing (risk) event.33
As detailed previously,13,14 we changed the risk of ovarian 
cancer calculation cutoff
 s in the MMS group in April, 
2005, to maintain annual triage rates of 15% of women to 
intermediate-risk and 2% to increased-risk categories. 
Safety data related to screening was monitored annually by 
the data monitoring and ethics committee, who also 
assessed performance characteristics of the screening 
strategies. We did an interim analysis of the primary 
outcome when about half of the anticipated number of 
ovarian cancer deaths had occurred in the no screening 
group. We had no stopping guidelines for futility, and the 
critical signifi
 cance level guideline for stopping for benefi
 t 
was small (signifi
 cance level of 0·001). 
All analyses were by modifi
 ed intention to screen. We 
analysed all randomly allocated women except for those 
who we later came to know had a bilateral oophorectomy,

Results
We invited 1 243 282 women to participate, recruiting 
205 090 between April 17, 2001, and Sept 29, 2005, 
randomising 202 638 (16·3%) between June 1, 2001, and 
Oct 21, 2005: 101 359 (50·0%) to no screening, 
50 640 (25·0%) to MMS, and 50 639 (25·0%) to USS. By 
end of screening on Dec 31, 2011, women attended 
345 570 MMS and 327 775 USS annual screening episodes. 
We excluded 92 (<0·5%) women (no screening 60 [<0·5%]; 
MMS 16 [<0·5%]; USS 16 [<0·5%]) from the primary 
analysis (fi
 gure 1). The fi
 nal cohort eligible for analysis 
consisted of 202 546 (>99·9%) women: 101 299 (>99·9%) 
in the no screening group, 50 624 (>99·9%) in the MMS 
group, and 50 623 (>99·9%) in the USS group. Baseline 
characteristics were balanced between study groups 
(table 1).
The last notifi
 cation from the Health and Social Care 
Information Centre was received on March 25, 2015, and 
from Northern Ireland, for deaths, on April 9, 2015, and for 
cancer, on April 15, 2015. Complete follow-up until study 
completion (Dec 31, 2014) or death was possible in 
200 293 (98·9%) women (no screening 100 149 [98·8%]; 
MMS 50 084 [98·9%]; USS 50 060 [98·9%]). Median follow-
up time was 11·1 years (IQR 10·0–12·0) for all groups. 
Of 3110 women investigated (appendix p 4), 1282 (41%) 
women were confi
 rmed on outcomes review to have 
ovarian cancer (table 2). The overall sensitivity for 
detection of ovarian cancers, diagnosed within a year of a 
screening, was 84% (95% CI 79–88; 199 of 237) in the 
MMS group and 73% (66–79; 161 of 221) in the USS 
group. Of the primary peritoneal cancers, 81% (13 of 16) 
were screen detected with MMS and 30% (three of ten) 
were with USS. We noted evidence of a higher proportion 
of invasive epithelial ovarian and peritoneal cancer 
diagnosed with low-volume disease (stage I, II, and IIIa) 
in the MMS group (119 [40%] of 299; p<0·0001) than in 
the no screening group (149 [26%] of 574), but not in the 
USS group (62 [24%] of 259; p=0·57; appendix p 5).
At censorship, 649 (0·32%) women had died of ovarian 
cancer: 347 (0·34%) in the no screening group, 
148 (0·29%) in the MMS group, and 154 (0·30%) in the 
USS group. The mortality reduction over years 0–14 with 
the Cox model was 15% (95% CI –3 to 30; p=0·10) in the 
MMS group and 11% (–7 to 27; p=0·21) in the USS group 
(table 3). Figure 2 shows the Kaplan-Meier cumulative 
death rates; in the appendix (pp 12, 13), the ovarian curves 
are overlaid with RP fi
 t. Figure 3 and the appendix (p 14) 
show that the no screening group hazard rate continues 
to rise throughout the study period, whereas the MMS 
hazard rate starts levelling off
 , becoming substantially 
lower than that of the no screening group at about 
7 years, with the USS hazard rate levelling off
  at about 
9 years, showing a potential delayed eff
 ect of screening.

In the appendix (pp 15, 16), HRs plotted over time32 from 
the RP model, a non-parametric estimate of HRs, and 
averaged post-hoc HRs over 0–7 years and 7–14 years are 
shown. After year 7, the HRs decrease rapidly, showing 
non-proportional hazards (type II)35 and a delayed 
mortality reduction for years 7–14 of 23% (95% CI 1–46) 
for MMS and 21% (–2 to 42) for USS. For years 0–7, the 
estimated mortality reduction was much smaller: 8% 
(–20 to 31) for MMS and 2% (–27 to 26) for USS (fi
 gure 2, 
table 3).
In the MMS group, we excluded an average of 63 (19%) 
prevalent ovarian cases from the 338 cases and we 
excluded an average of 116 (18%) prevalent cases from the 
630 cases in the no screening group, showing the 
expected equal proportion of prevalent cases in the two 
groups. Hazards were not proportional (p=0·037), so we 
fi
 tted separate RP models to the survival data for each 
group, showing excellent overlap with the non-parametric 
Kaplan-Meier cumulative mortality curves (fi
 gure 4). The 
hazards between the MMS and no screening groups were 
signifi
 cantly diff
 erent (p=0·021), showing that ovarian 
cancer mortality was signifi
 cantly lower in the MMS 
group (20% [–2 to 40]) than in the no screening group 
(table 3). The mortality reduction was also higher for 
years 7–14 (28% [–3 to 49]) than for years 0–7 (8% [–27 to 43]). 
Because the HRs were not constant over time and the 
Cox model has low power for detection of a late eff
 ect of 
this type,35 we did a single post-hoc analysis using the 
WLR test inspired by the rationale in the PLCO Cancer 
Screening Trial report (appendix p 11).24 The median 
delay from randomisation to death in the no screening 
group was over 8 years (randomisation to cancer diagnosis 
6 years; diagnosis to death 2·3 years). This analysis 
suggested a signifi
 cant reduction in ovarian cancer 
mortality in the MMS group compared with the no 
screening group, but not in the USS group (table 3).
In addition to the ovarian and fallopian tube deaths, we 
noted a further 11 deaths due to primary peritoneal cancer 
in the no screening group, 12 in the MMS group, and 
nine in the USS group (table 3). This resulted in smaller 
mortality reductions with the MMS versus no screening 
and USS versus no screening comparisons than with the 
ovarian cancer mortality reductions (fi
 gure 2, table 3). As 
with the primary outcome, the no screening group hazard 
rate continues to rise, whereas the MMS and USS hazard 
rates start levelling off
  (appendix p 17). The RP model also 
yielded higher mortality reductions for years 7–14 than for 
years 0–7, with the MMS reduction increasing if prevalent 
cases are excluded (fi
 gure 4).

In the MMS group, of 427 448 eligible screening episodes, 
345 570 were attended, giving a compliance of 80·8%. In 
the USS group, of 420 047 eligible screening episodes, 
327 775 were attended, giving a 78·0% compliance 
(appendix p 6). At censorship with a maximum follow-up 
of 13·6 years, the preliminary number needed to screen to 
prevent one death from ovarian cancer was 641 (95% CI 
375–1934; appendix p 18). Sensitivity analyses for source of 
ovarian cancer death, correlation within RCs, competing 
risks, and parametric estimation show only minor 
diff
 erences (appendix p 7).
We noted no evidence of a diff
 erence in deaths because 
of other causes between the MMS, USS, and no screening 
groups (appendix p 8). The age-standardised incidence and 
mortality rates for cancer and death from any cause 
increased with time from randomisation in the no 
screening group such that at the end of the trial, rates were 
similar to UK population rates (appendix p 23). Survival 
curves from date of diagnosis of ovarian cancers in the no 
screening group were similar to those of the age-
standardised UK population, with a 5 year survival rate of 
41% (95% CI 37–45) and a 10 year survival rate of 33% 
(28–38; appendix p 19).
The overall incidence of ovarian cancer was 57 (95% CI 
53–62; 
630 
cancers; 
1 097 089 
women-years) 
per 
100 000 women-years in the no screening group, 
62 (55–68; 338 cancers; 548 553 women-years) per 
100 000 women-years in the MMS group, and 57 (51–64; 
314 cancers; 548 825 women-years) per 100 000 women-
years in the USS group. We noted no evidence of a 
diff
 erence in incidence of ovarian cancer between the 
three groups (appendix pp 20–22). The incidence of 
invasive epithelial ovarian cancer and peritoneal cancer 
was also similar: 52 (48–61; 575 cancers; 1 097 089 women-
years) per 100 000 women-years in the no screening 
group, 55 (48–57; 299 cancers; 548 553 women-years) per 
100 000 women-years in the MMS group, and 47 (41–53; 
259 cancers; 548 825 women-years) per 100 000 women-
years in the USS group.
We noted screening complications in 30 (<1%) women 
in the MMS group and 61 (<1%) in the USS group, giving 
a screening-related complication rate of 8·6 per 100 000 in 
the MMS group and 18·6 per 100 000 in the USS group 
(appendix p 9). We noted benign adnexal pathology or 
normal adnexa in 488 (1·0%) women in the MMS group 
and 1634 (3·2%) women in the USS group who had 
screen-positive surgery (appendix p 9). This fi
 nding 
translates to 14 (345 572 annual screens) false-positive 
surgeries per 10 000 screens in the MMS group and 
50 (327 775 annual screens) false-positive surgeries per 
10 000 screens in the USS group. For each ovarian and 
peritoneal cancer detected by screening, an additional two 
(488 false positives; 212 ovarian and peritoneal cancers) 
women in the MMS group and ten (1634 false positives; 
164 ovarian and peritoneal cancers) women in the USS 
group had false-positive surgery. Women in the MMS 
group had a complication rate of 3·1% (95% CI 1·7–5·0; 
15 of 488) and those in the USS group had a rate of 3·5% 
(2·7–4·5; 57 of 1634). Outside of the trial, during the same 
period, 792 (0·8%) women in the no screening group, 
466 (0·9%) in the MMS group, and 441 (0·9%) in the USS 
group had both ovaries or the only remaining ovary 
removed for a range of indications and had benign 
pathology or normal adnexa. Data for complications 
associated with these surgeries are not available. The 
overall ratio of women who had surgery resulting in 
benign adnexal pathology or normal adnexa to women 
with ovarian and peritoneal cancer was 1·2 (792:645) in

the no screening group, 2·7 (954:354) in the MMS group, 
and 6·4 (2075:324) in the USS group. Details of fi
 nal 
follow-up questionnaire responses are provided in the 
appendix (p 25). Ovarian cancer screening outside of 
UKCTOCS was documented in 1660 (4·3% [95% CI 
4·1–4·5]) of 38 238 women in the no screening group who 
completed the follow-up questionnaire in 2014.
Discussion
The relative mortality reduction was 15% in the MMS 
group and 11% in the USS group, but these reductions 
were not signifi
 cant with the primary prespecifi
 ed Cox 
analysis. In retrospect, it would have been preferable to 
specify a primary analysis that was weighted to refl
 ect the 
predictable delay in mortality reduction in a screening trial 
of this type. Nevertheless, in view of the trend in mortality 
in the no screening and screening groups, signifi
 cance 
using the Cox analysis could be achieved on further follow-
up. However, the prespecifi
 ed secondary subgroup analysis 
with exclusion of prevalent cases in the MMS group was 
signifi
 cant, suggesting that the long-term eff
 ect of an 
MMS screening programme is about a 28% mortality 
reduction after 7 years of screening. This signifi
 cant, yet 
delayed eff
 ect was supported by the sole post-hoc weighted 
analysis, which was also signifi
 cant for the MMS group. 
These results are encouraging for various reasons. First, 
the mortality hazard rate in the no screening group seems 
to increase, whereas in the two screened groups, it levels 
off
 , resulting in decreasing HRs. This fi
 nding suggests 
that the diff
 erence in mortality between no screening and 
screening groups will increase with time and further 
follow-up. Second, the mortality diff
 erence was not 
constant across the trial. It was low for the fi
 rst 7 years after 
randomisation, but the estimated mortality reductions 
increased during years 7–14. The mortality reduction in the 
MMS group for years 7–14 remained high in subgroup 
analyses with exclusion of prevalent cases for primary and 
secondary outcomes and in the secondary outcome 
analyses inclu 
ding peritoneal cancer deaths (albeit slightly 
lower). This late eff
 ect was predictable in view of the 
unavoidable time interval from randomisation to diagnosis 
and then death. For participants who died in the no 
screening group the median interval from randomisation 
to death was more than 8 years.
The late eff
 ect on mortality seen in this trial is often 
noted in screening trials in which survival is measured 
from date of randomisation. In the European 
Randomised Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer 
trial,36 an eff
 ect of screening only emerged 7 years after 
randomisation. Similarly, investigators of the Norwegian 
Colorectal Cancer Prevention Trial37 noted an eff
 ect 
9 years from randomisation. The PLCO Cancer 
Screening Trial24–27 and National Lung Screening Trial28 
used the weighted log-rank test in anticipation of this 
delayed eff
 ect. Overall, the results suggested that an 
unequivocally signifi
 cant diff
 erence in mortality might 
emerge after longer follow-up.
The estimate of relative reduction in ovarian cancer 
mortality in UKCTOCS is in keeping with relative 
reductions noted in breast cancer randomised screening 
trials, which vary between 15% and 25%, and with those 
noted in meta-analyses of observational studies, which 
vary between 13% and 17%.38 Using UK population data 
from 2007, Loberg and colleagues38 reported that for 
1000 women invited to biennial mammography screening 
for 20 years from 50 years of age, two to three women are 
prevented from dying of breast cancer. Findings from this 
trial suggest that for 641 women screened annually using 
the multimodal strategy for 14 years, one ovarian cancer 
death is prevented.
The only directly comparable trial with this trial is the 
ovarian component of the PLCO Cancer Screening Trial.24 
However, some diff
 erences exist between the two, 
including, in this trial, use of ROCA (as opposed to a 
CA125 cutoff
 ) and detailed screening algorithms. We 
centrally managed implementation of the entire screening 
protocol with predefi
 ned pathways for all women detected 
to have abnormalities, fail-safe monitoring, and quality 
assurance. In the PLCO Cancer Screening Trial, no 
diff
 erence was noted in ovarian and peritoneal cancer 
deaths between the screening and control groups at a 
median follow-up of 12·4 years. In our secondary outcome 
analysis, we noted a mortality trend that was in keeping 
with our primary analysis and diff
 erent to that noted in the 
PLCO Cancer Screening Trial. This fi
 nding follows on 
from the higher sensitivity and stage shift noted earlier in 
the MMS group of this trial.
Both venepuncture and transvaginal ultrasound were 
associated with minor complications and very low 
complication rates. Most postmenopausal women found 
transvaginal USS acceptable, with 3·5% reporting 
moderate or severe pain during the scan.39 As previously 
reported from the UKCTOCS psychosocial study,15 
screening did not increase general anxiety. The number 
of women having surgery for false-positive screen results 
was as predicted in the trial design and for MMS, was 
much fewer than the upper acceptable limit, whereas for 
USS, it was on the border of acceptability. The small 
number of operations associated with MMS has been 
noted in previous trials.9,40 During the course of this trial, 
the ratio of women who had surgery for which ovaries 
had benign pathology or were normal to those diagnosed 
with ovarian and peritoneal cancer was 2·3-times higher 
in the MMS group and 5·3-times higher in the USS 
group than in the no screening group. Complication 
rates of false-positive surgery of 3·1% in the MMS group 
and 3·5% in the USS group were similar to the major 
complication rate of 2·9% reported for benign surgery 
undertaken in NHS gynaecological oncology centres in a 
recent multicentre audit.41
Key strengths of this trial include scale, with more than 
202 000 participants, more than 670 000 annual screening 
episodes, and more than 2·19 million women-years of 
follow-up; the multicentre setting within the UK NHS;

central management of screening protocols with use of a 
bespoke web-based trial management system; high 
compliance; low contamination in the no screening 
group; completeness of ascertainment of deaths through 
linkage to national registries; an outcomes review 
committee masked to group assignment; and treatment 
of all women within the NHS. The healthy volunteer 
eff
 ect, noted initially, waned over time, such that by the 
end of the trial, age-standardised cancer incidence and 
all-cause mortality rates in the no screening group were 
similar to the UK population, as were ovarian cancer 
survival rates (appendix p 23). 
The main limitation of this trial was our failure to 
anticipate the late eff
 ect of screening in our statistical 
design. Had we done so, the weighted log-rank test could 
have been planned in line with many other large cancer 
screening trials, including the ovarian component of the 
PLCO Cancer Screening Trial.24 As a result, we report, as 
planned, the Cox test as the primary analysis balanced by a 
signifi
 cant preplanned analysis with exclusion of prevalent 
cases, with support from a sole post-hoc WLR test in the 
MMS group. Generalisability of the results will depend on 
central implementation of the screening protocols, with 
accompanying 
quality 
assurance 
processes. 
This 
implementation, although  challenging, is achievable 
through the processes used in the NHS national screening 
programme. Further follow-up is needed to assess the 
extent of the mortality reduction before fi
 rm conclusions 
can be reached on the long-term effi
  cacy and cost-
eff
 ectiveness of ovarian cancer screening.
