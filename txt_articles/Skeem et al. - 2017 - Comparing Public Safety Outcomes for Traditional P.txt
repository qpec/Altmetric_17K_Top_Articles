 Comparing Public Safety Outcomes for Traditional Probation
vs Specialty Mental Health Probation
Jennifer L. Skeem, PhD; Sarah Manchak, PhD; Lina Montoya, MA
IMPORTANCE Probation is a cornerstone of efforts to reduce mass incarceration. Although it
is understudied, specialty probation could improve outcomes for the overrepresented group
of people with mental illness.
OBJECTIVE To test whether specialty probation yields better public safety outcomes than
traditional probation.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A longitudinal observational study with group matching
on age, sex, race/ethnicity, probation time, and offense at 2 urban agencies that exemplify
specialty and traditional probation. Enrollment began October 19, 2005; follow-up data were
complete January 26, 2013. Participants were 359 diverse probationers with serious mental
health problems and functional impairment. Probationers and officers were assessed 3 times
(for probationers, 6-month retention, 315 of 359 [88%]; 12-month retention 304 of 359
[85%]) and follow-up records were obtained. Machine learning algorithms were combined
with a targeted maximum likelihood estimation, a double robust estimator that accounts for
associations between confounders and both treatment assignment and outcomes. Statistical
analysis was conducted from January 1, 2016, to May 5, 2017.
INTERVENTIONS Specialty probationers were assigned to small, homogeneous caseloads
supervised by experts. Prior data indicate that specialty officers had better relationships with
probationers, participated more in probationers’treatment, and relied more on positive
compliance strategies than traditional officers.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Violence during 1 year, determined by probationer report,
officer report, and records, and rearrest during a period of 2 to 5 years, according to Federal
Bureau of Investigation records.
RESULTS Participants were 183 specialty (73.8% of 248 eligible) and 176 traditional (56.6% of
311 eligible) probationers (205 men and 154 women; mean [SD] age, 36.9 [10.6]). Although
specialty probation had no significant effect on violence (odds ratio, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.69-1.36),
the odds of rearrest were 2.68 times higher for traditional probationers than for specialty
probationers (95% CI, 1.86-3.84; P < .001). At 2 years, estimated probabilities of rearrest
were 28.6% for specialty probationers and 51.8% for traditional probationers. Survival
analyses indicate that arrest effects endured up to 5 years.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Although it did not specifically reduce violence,
well-implemented specialty probation appears to be effective in reducing general recidivism.
Reform efforts for people with mental illness could leverage probation—a ubiquitous and
revitalized node of the justice system.

 T
here is a well-recognized need for effective, special-
ized interventions for individuals with mental illness in
the criminal justice system. In the United States, rates
of mental illnesses such as major depression, bipolar disor-
der, and schizophrenia are 3 to 6 times higher in the criminal
justice population than the general population.1 Each year, ap-
proximately 2 million people with serious mental illness are
booked into the nation’
s jails.1 These people typically stay lon-
ger in jail than do those without mental illness and, on re-
lease, are more likely to be reincarcerated.2 “Jails spend 2 to 3
times more money on adults with mental illnesses…than on
those without those needs, yet often do not see improve-
ments to public safety or these individuals’health.”3
Thus far, specialized intervention efforts have had limited
success.2 The human and fiscal costs of this problem have in-
spiredSteppingUp,anationalinitiativeledbytheAmericanPsy-
chiatric Association Foundation, the National Association of
Counties, and the Council of State Governments. Stepping Up

than 300 counties have resolved to “step up” their efforts to re-
duce the number of people with mental illness in jail.4

This larger context revitalizes specialty mental health pro-
bation, which has long been promoted for people with mental
illnessinthecriminaljusticesystem.9,10Accordingtoanational

cies were implementing specialty probation, but only a subset

as a key to reduction in recidivism.12,13
Although key features of the specialty model have been
clarified, research on whether specialty mental health proba-
tion works is especially limited. The most basic question is
whether specialty probation reduces recidivism, given that the
chief goal of justice agencies is to protect public safety.14 We
could identify only 2 controlled studies of the effect of spe-
cialty probation on recidivism. First, in an unpublished evalu-
ation(describedinSkeemandLouden15)thatissparseonmeth-
odological detail, investigators randomly assigned 400
Californiaprobationerstospecialtyortraditionalprobationand
found no difference in the groups’rates of return to the local
jail. Second, using administrative data from New Jersey, Wolff
et al16 found a greater decrease in jail days for probationers
placed on specialty mental health supervision than for pro-
bationers on traditional probation who received any mental
health services, after controlling for basic demographics and
type of offense. Although these results are promising, the fol-
low-up was short (6 months) and the covariate set was lim-
ited, increasing the risk that results reflect unmeasured clini-
cal and criminologic differences between groups.
Rigorous evidence about the effect of specialty probation
is needed to inform efforts to step up justice reform for this
group. In this article, we describe the results of a longitudinal,
multimethodstudydesignedtofillthisgapintheliterature.The
aims of the study were to assess whether specialty probation
reducesthelikelihoodofviolenceandarrestcomparedwithtra-
ditional probation for probationers with mental illness. Out-
comes were measured during follow-up periods of 1 to 5 years,
based on multiple sources (self-report, collateral-report, and
Federal Bureau of Investigation records). If our hypothesis that
specialty probation improves public safety is supported, the
study could elevate the status of probation itself—a ubiquitous
and revitalized component of the justice system.
Methods
Procedure
The results of a national survey on probation and mental
health11 were used to select 2 urban agencies that exempli-
fied the specialty model (in Texas) and the traditional model
(in California) but were similar in jurisdiction size, proba-
tioner characteristics, and mental health expenditures.
Matched groups of probationers were recruited from the 2
agencies. Enrollment began October 19, 2005; follow-up data
were complete January 26, 2013. Probationers and their su-
pervising officers were assessed at 3 time points after proba-
tion placement, and official records were reviewed. Specifi-
cally, probationers were interviewed at baseline and were
interviewed again 6 and 12 months later (6-month retention,
315 of 359 [88%]; 12-month retention 304 of 359 [85%]). Offi-
cers were surveyed on the same schedule. Records were coded
Key Points
Question Does specialty probation yield better public safety
outcomes than traditional probation for people with mental
illness?
Findings In this longitudinal study that included 359 probationers
with mental illness, specialty probation did not significantly reduce
violence but substantially reduced rearrest rates. At 2 years, an
estimated 28.6% of specialty probationers and 51.8% of
traditional probationers had been rearrested.
Meaning In the current era of criminal justice reform, specialty
probation holds substantial promise as a method for reducing
mass incarceration for people with mental illness.

 to capture treatment involvement and arrests, after place-
ment. The protocol was approved by the University of Califor-
nia, Irvine; Texas Department of Criminal Justice; and Cali-
fornia Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. All
participants provided written informed consent.
Participants
Eligibility criteria included age 18 to 65 years, English speak-
ing, on active probation, provision of voluntary and in-
formed consent to participate, and identification as mentally
ill (without mental retardation). The processes for identify-
ing probationers with mental illness differed by site.
At the specialty site, probationers were referred to the spe-
cialty program by traditional officers (176 of 183 cases [96%]) or
judges (7 or 183 cases [7%]) and received a diagnosis of a men-
talillnessbasedonapsychologicalevaluation.Of248eligiblepro-
bationers assigned to specialty caseloads, 183 (73.8%) enrolled.
Nosignificantdifferenceswereobservedbetweenenrolleesand
nonenrollees in age, sex, or self-reported race/ethnicity.
At the traditional site, researchers identified probation-
ers with mental illness by asking officers to refer clients ap-
propriate for specialty supervision to the study (ie, clients with
knownpsychiatricproblems,psychotropicmedications,and/or
hospitalizations) and adding validated mental health screen-
ing tools to the probation intake process.13 Research clini-
cians verified the presence of psychiatric problems, both for
referred (141 of 176 [80%]) and screened-in (35 of 176 [20%])
participants.

Specialty and traditional probationers were similar across
matching variables. As shown in the Table, probationers were
ethnically diverse men and women with serious mental ill-
ness; their mean (SD) Colorado Symptom Index scores were
at or near the cutoff score of 30 for psychiatric disability (spe-
cialty probationers, 30.1 [12.1]; traditional probationers, 25.8
[12.8]).17 Personality Assessment Inventory substance abuse
subscale scores are consistent with the median for clinical
samples,18 with no significant group differences.
Intervention
The implementation of specialty probation and traditional
probation was carefully assessed in this study. Results are
detailed by Manchak et al.13 In brief, in the specialty agency,
probationers were assigned to small caseloads composed
exclusively of people with mental illness and supervised by
officers with relevant expertise. The mean caseload size was
50 probationers for specialty officers (n = 15) and approxi-
mately 100 probationers for traditional officers (n = 87).
Compared with traditional officers, specialty officers estab-
lished higher-quality relationships with probationers, par-
ticipated more directly in probationers’ treatment, and
relied more heavily on positive compliance strategies than
sanction threats. Specialty probationers were significantly
more likely to receive mental health treatment (167 of 183
[91%] vs 106 of 176 [60%]) and integrated dual diagnosis
treatment (62 of 183 [34%] vs 26 of 176 [15%]) than were tra-
ditional probationers within 1 year, but they were no more
likely to receive substance use treatment (51 of 183 [28%] vs
55 of 176 [31%]).13
Outcomes
Violence
Violence was operationalized based on the approach used by
Steadmanetal.19Ateachassessment,probationersandtheiroffi-
cers were independently asked whether the probationer had
beeninvolvedinseveralcategoriesofaggressiveactsinthepast
6 months. Official probation records were also reviewed. The
most serious act per violent incident was coded. Violence
was defined as physical battery, sexual assault, threat with a
weapon in hand, or an assaultive act with a weapon. Because
aggression tends to be underreported, violence was coded as
having occurred when reported by any source. During the
1-year follow-up, 102 of 291 probationers (35.1%) were
involved in violence.
Arrest
Probationers’Federal Bureau of Investigation reports were
obtained to code the date and type20 of arrests that occurred
during a minimum 2-year follow-up period. The most serious
charge per arrest was coded; arrests solely for probation vio-
lations were excluded, given our focus on public safety out-
comes. During the 2-year follow-up, 150 of 354 probationers
(42.4%) were arrested; of 274 for whom charge type data
were available, 100 (36.5%) were listed as a person arrest, 69
(25.2%) a property arrest, 82 (29.9%) a drug arrest, and 23
(8.4%) minor offenses.
Because probationers had different lengths of follow-up,
wealsocreatedvariablestoindicatehowlongprobationerssur-
vived in the community without rearrest. These variables in-
dicate the number of days without an arrest since the base-
line interview (N = 354; mean [SD] follow-up period, 738.8
[448.4] days), excluding days incarcerated or hospitalized.
Covariates
To accurately estimate the association between specialty pro-
bation and public safety outcomes, we controlled for covari-
ates that theoretically predicted both treatment assignment
(specialty vs traditional) and outcomes. Based on past re-
search and empirical relationships, these covariates were se-
lected from a pool of more than 100 baseline characteristics.13
The potential confounders were specified a priori using causal
theory graphs.21 Missing values were imputed for continuous
and categorical covariates using median imputation and re-
sampling with replacement.
The main covariate set consisted of the 21 variables listed
in the Table. This set characterizes a probationer’
s demo-
graphics and socioeconomic status, history of criminal
behavior and childhood abuse,20 substance abuse, external-
izing symptoms, and other psychiatric symptoms, based on
the Personality Assessment Inventory,18 the Colorado Symp-
tom Index,17 and the Global Assessment of Functioning.22

 too many covariates for our sample size. In the eAppendix in
the Supplement, we describe 2 alternative covariate sets and
the results they yielded (which parallel those reported).
Statistical Analysis
Specialty vs Traditional Probation Outcomes
Over Fixed Follow-up Periods
Primary statistical analysis was conducted from January 1,
2016, to May 5, 2017. We used targeted maximum likelihood
estimation (TMLE)23 to estimate the association between spe-
cialty vs traditional probation and violence for 1 year and re-
arrest for 2 years. Targeted maximum likelihood estimation is
asemiparametricestimatorthatdependsonestimationofboth
the treatment mechanism (ie, probability of specialty assign-
ment, given covariates) and the outcome (ie, violence or re-
arrest, given treatment and covariates). Targeted maximum
likelihood estimation is doubly robust: it is consistent (unbi-
ased as sample size grows) if either treatment assignment or
the outcome is correctly estimated. Unlike alternative tech-
niques, the estimator does not rely solely on a correctly speci-
fied outcome regression or treatment mechanism.24
Both the outcome regression and treatment mechanism
were estimated using the SuperLearner algorithm, an en-
semble method that combines a library of data-adaptive ma-
chine learning algorithms and parametric models to build an
estimator that performs as well or better than any algorithm
in the library.25 The library of methods helps one avoid poten-
tially problematic assumptions (eg, linear associations), and
a cross-validation step is included to avoid overfitting. In our
application, the library included the 18 methods listed in the
eAppendix in the Supplement.
Specialty vs Traditional Probation and Time to Rearrest
Participants had different lengths of follow-up for rearrest,
many of which were longer than the fixed 2-year follow-up.
Tomakefulluseofeachparticipant’
sfollow-upperiod,weused
survival analyses to examine whether specialty probation pre-
ceded and increased the likelihood of longer “survival time”
in the community without arrest. Specifically, we used the
Kaplan-Meier method to estimate survival probabilities and
median survival time by group.26 Observations were weighted
based on the propensity scores estimated by SuperLearner (ie,
the estimated treatment assignment mechanism in TMLE).
That is, participants whose conditional probability of receiv-
ing their probation type was low were upweighted, and those
whose probability of receiving their probation type was high
weredownweighted,toapproximaterandomassignment.Con-
fidence intervals were calculated by adding and subtracting
twice the SE of the estimate.
Software
Analyses were performed using R, version 3.3.0 (GNU S), and
statistical significance was set at α = .05. Targeted maximum
likelihood estimation analyses were performed using the tmle
package.27 Estimation of the outcome regression and treat-
ment mechanism was performed using SuperLearner.28
Results
Preliminary Analyses
Raw descriptive statistics indicate that specialty probation-
ers and traditional probationers had similar observed rates of
violence (54 of 149 [36.2%] vs 48 of 142 [33.8%] at 1 year) but
not arrest (57 of 181 [31.5%] vs 93 of 173 [53.8%] at 2 years).
These figures, however, are uncorrected for covariates.
SuperLearner is used to test and combine multiple mod-
els. As shown in the eAppendix in the Supplement, the high-
estweightedalgorithmschosenbySuperLearner,sharedacross
treatment assignment and outcome regressions, included gen-
eralized linear models, Bayesian generalized linear models,
multivariate adaptive regression splines (“earth”), and classi-
fication and regression training (“caret”).
Specialty vs Traditional Probation and Outcomes During
Fixed Follow-up Periods
The results of TMLE estimation and inference indicate that
specialty supervision has no significant association with vio-
lence. The odds of violence within 1 year are similar for tradi-
tional probationers and specialty probationers (odds ratio,
0.97; 95% CI, 0.69-1.36; P = .84). Figure 1 displays estimated
probabilities of violence, which indicate a nonsignificant
0.76% difference between groups (95% CI, –8.21% to 6.69%;
P = .84).
However, specialty probation is associated with a signifi-
cant reduction in rearrest. Targeted maximum likelihood es-
timation indicates that the odds of rearrest within 2 years are
2.68(95%CI,1.86-3.84;P < .001)higherforprobationersintra-
ditional probation than those in specialty probation. As shown
in Figure 1, the probability of rearrest within 2 years is 23.1%
(95% CI, 14.9%-31.4%; P < .001) higher for probationers in tra-
ditional probation (51.8%) than specialty probation (28.6%).

 probationers (bottom curve). The nonoverlapping 95% CIs in-
dicate that group differences are maintained across time. At
nearly 5 years (right side), the probability of having survived
in the community without a rearrest is 62% for specialty pro-
bationers and 36% for traditional probationers.
Discussion
Probation has become a cornerstone of policies designed to re-
duce mass incarceration in the United States. To inform efforts
tostepupjusticereformforpeoplewithmentalillness,wecon-
ducted a multimethod study to estimate the effect of specialty
probation on public safety outcomes. We used TMLE, a double
robust estimator, to approximate the causal effect of specialty
probation on public safety outcomes. These estimates suggest
that specialty probation had no significant effect on violence,
but substantially reduced rearrest rates. Traditional probation-
ers were 2.68 (95% CI, 1.86-3.84) times more likely to be rear-
restedwithin2yearsthanwerethoseonspecialtymentalhealth
probation, which translates to a 23.1% decrease in arrest rates
(28.6% specialty vs 51.8% traditional).
Because this study is the first, to our knowledge, to exam-
ine the effect of specialty probation on violence, it is difficult
to contextualize our null finding for this outcome. During the
1-year follow-up, more than one-third of probationers were in-
volved in violence, whether they were on specialty supervi-
sion or not. This lack of difference could be because specialty
probation focuses on psychiatric service linkage, and mental
illness is a weak predictor of violent recidivism.29 It is more
likely, however, that this lack of difference is because proba-
tion is not specifically designed to reduce violence.
Instead, the mission of probation is to protect general pub-
licsafety.Inkeepingwiththatmission,ourresultsindicatethat
specialty probation substantially reduced the likelihood of re-
arrest for any crime (ie, person, property, drug, and minor of-
fenses).ThisfindingisconsistentwiththefindingbyWolffetal16
that specialty supervision had a short-term effect on the num-
berofjaildays,butitgreatlyextendsthatfinding16byfocusingon
arrests (which index public safety more than utilization) over
alongerfollow-up(years,notmonths).Inthepresentstudy,es-
timated effects were meaningful and lasting; survival analyses
indicate that nearly 5 years after placement, the probability of
no rearrest was 62% among specialty probationers compared
with only 36% for traditional probationers (Figure 2).
The positive effects observed in these studies are un-
likely to generalize to nonprototypical agencies; results of a

load sizes above a mean of 45, they begin to function like tra-
ditional agencies.11 Therefore, agencies must allocate re-
sources appropriately to permit high-fidelity implementation
ofspecialtycaseloads.Inafuturereport,wewillshowthatspe-
cialty probation is more cost-effective than traditional proba-
tion because costs of small caseloads are more than offset by
savings in arrests and acute services.
In future work, we will also examine how specialty proba-

ticipated more directly in probationers’treatment, and relied
more heavily on positive compliance strategies.13
Limitations
Participants were not randomly assigned to probation types;
instead, specialty probationers were drawn from one jurisdic-
tion, and traditional probationers were drawn from another,
introducingpotentialconfounds.Toaddressthisissue,wefirst
used a powerful causal inference estimation approach (TMLE)
and included a rich set of 21 covariates to adjust for confound-
ers (eTable in the Supplement). As shown in the eAppendix in

 ond, we consulted Federal Bureau of Investigation compari-
son data,30 which indicate that average arrest rates from 2007
to 2012 were slightly higher in the specialty jurisdiction than
in the traditional jurisdiction (6% vs 3%), easing concern that
the estimated reduction of arrest rates for specialty probation-
ers is an artifact of local arrest practices. Together, these points
(plus sample matching, precise measurement, and strong
implementation)lendsubstantialconfidencetoourresults,but
they need to be replicated in an experiment.
Conclusions
Some hallmarks of specialty mental health probation, such as
establishing firm, fair, and caring relationships with probation-
ers, are general staples of evidence-based probation.31,32 These
study results provide direction for leveraging reform in gen-
eral probation to help jurisdictions step up their efforts to re-
duce incarceration specifically for people with mental illness.
