 CALIOP-SLF1 (Fig. 3D), CALIOP-SLF2 (Fig. 3E),
and high-SLF (Fig. 3F). It is worth noting that the
cloud-phase feedback is particularly sensitive to
higher initial-state SLFs over the pristine Southern
Ocean in the observationally constrained cases.
Underestimates of SLFs relative to observations
in this region (30) lead to an artificially stronger
cloud-phase feedback that can ultimately lead to
an underestimate of ECS. The negative lt values
over the tropical Pacific are attributed to the thick-
ening of high clouds (27).
Global satellite observations of cloud thermo-
dynamic phases have enabled us to show that
unrealistically low SLFs common to a multitude
of GCMs lead to a cloud-phase feedback that is
too negative. This has important ramifications
for ECS estimates. Should the low-SLF bias be
eliminated in GCMs, the most likely range of ECS
should shift to higher values. It should be noted
that there are variations in the way in which
microphysical processes are parameterized in
GCMs. Thus, the method by which SLFs can be
constrained in GCMs is not unique, and a repeat
of this study in other GCMs may thus lead to
other climate feedback responses that are not
captured by the GCM used in this study. How-
ever, regardless of how SLFs are constrained, the
SLF will affect the magnitude of the cloud-phase
feedback and therefore GCMs’ estimates of ECS.
Looking forward, continued improvements of
the accuracy of various observational methods,
better understanding of mixed-phase cloud pro-
cesses, and their improved representation in GCMs
are all factors that are critical to improving the
accuracy of ECS estimates.

MYC regulates the antitumor
immune response through
CD47 and PD-L1

The MYC oncogene codes for a transcription factor that is overexpressed in many human
cancers. Here we show that MYC regulates the expression of two immune checkpoint proteins
on the tumor cell surface: the innate immune regulator CD47 (cluster of differentiation 47)
and the adaptive immune checkpoint PD-L1 (programmed death–ligand 1). Suppression of
MYC in mouse tumors and human tumor cells caused a reduction in the levels of CD47 and
PD-L1 messenger RNA and protein. MYC was found to bind directly to the promoters of the
Cd47 and Pd-l1 genes. MYC inactivation in mouse tumors down-regulated CD47 and PD-L1
expression and enhanced the antitumor immune response. In contrast, when MYC was
inactivated in tumors with enforced expression of CD47 or PD-L1, the immune response was
suppressed, and tumors continued to grow. Thus, MYC appears to initiate and maintain
tumorigenesis, in part, through the modulation of immune regulatory molecules.
T
he transcription factor MYC regulates the
expression of a multitude of gene products
involved in cell proliferation, growth, self-
renewal, differentiation, and apoptosis (1–4).
The MYC gene is genetically activated and
overexpressed in many human cancers (1–4), and
this overexpression has been causally linked to
tumorigenesis (5, 6). Studies involving indu-
cible transgenic mouse models have shown that
growth of Myc-induced tumors is dependent on
continuous expression of MYC (1–4, 7–10). For
example, in the tetracycline-off mouse model
(where Myc expression can be turned off by the
addition of tetracycline or doxycycline), tumors
grow only when Myc is “on.” When Myc is turned
“off,” tumors regress.
In mouse models, MYC inactivation results in
tumor regression through the induction of pro-
liferative arrest and apoptosis (1–3, 7, 8, 10–12).
We have demonstrated that complete tumor clear-
ancethat occursafterthe inactivationof oncogenes,
including Myc, requires the recruitment of CD4+
T cells and the secretion of thrombospondin-1
(13,14).Hence,ahost-dependentimmuneresponse
is required for sustained tumor regression.
However, the mechanism by which oncogene in-
activationelicitsthisimmuneresponseisunknown.
The host immune system generally serves as a
barrier against tumor formation (15). Activation
of the immune response can contribute to tumor
regression (13, 16, 17) through both adaptive and
innate immune effectors (18–20). Programmed
death–ligand 1 (or PD-L1, also known as CD274
and B7-H1) sends a critical “don’t find me” signal
to the adaptive immune system (21–23), whereas
CD47 (cluster of differentiation 47) sends a crit-
ical “don’t eat me” signal to the innate immune
system and acts as a regulator of the adaptive
immune response (24, 25) (fig. S1A). These and
similarmolecules areoften overexpressedonhuman
tumors (22, 25). Therapeutic suppression of PD-L1

 and other immune checkpoint molecules elicits
animmune response againsttumors. Recently, this
strategy has been applied in clinical practice, with
very encouraging results (26–29).
To explore whether and how MYC regulates
the antitumor response, we examined its effect
on the expression of CD47 and PD-L1 in the Tet-
off transgenic mouse model of MYC-induced
T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (MYC T-ALL).
When MYC was turned on, both CD47 and PD-L1
were expressed. However, in vitro or in vivo Myc
inactivation resulted in a rapid down-regulation
of CD47 and PD-L1—both at the mRNA level, as
detected by quantitative real-time polymerase
chain reaction (qPCR), and at the protein level, as
detected by flow cytometry (Fig. 1, A and B) and
immunofluorescence (fig. S1B). Expression of other
immune-related surface receptors was not affected
by MYC inactivation (Fig. 1A). Consistent with
these observations, suppression of MYC expres-
sion in the human T-ALL cell lines CCRF-CEM
and Jurkat, either by treatment with a MYC-
targeting short hairpin RNA (shRNA) (fig. S2A)
or with the BET (bromodomain and extraterminal)
inhibitor JQ1 (30), reduced the expression of CD47
and PD-L1 (Fig. 1C). Treatment of MYC T-ALL
cells with the chemotherapeutic drugs prednisone,
cytoxan, cisplatin, or vincristine, resulted in tumor
cell death. However, CD47 and PD-L1 were either
unaffected or showed increased expression (fig.
S3A), and there was no effect on the expression
of CD3, CD8, CD25, or CD69 (fig. S3, B to E).
We next investigated the effect of MYC inacti-
vation on CD47 and PD-L1 in mouse and human
solid tumors. In a Tet-off transgenic mouse mod-
el of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (3), inhibi-
tion of MYC expression resulted in decreased
levels of CD47 and PD-L1 protein (fig. S4, A and B)
and mRNA (fig. S4B); expression of the two pro-
teins was not affected by cisplatin treatment (fig.
S4A). In the human HCC cell line HEPG2, shRNA
knockdown of MYC caused a reduction in the
levels of both CD47 and PD-L1 mRNA (fig. S4C).
We also investigated the relationship between MYC
expression and CD47 and PD-L1 expression in the
human melanoma cell line SKMEL28 (Fig. 2A)
and the human non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
cell line H1299 (Fig. 2B), as these cells represent
tumor types that are often treated with immune
checkpoint inhibitors in the clinic (31). We found
that MYC shRNA knockdown and MYC functional
suppression by JQ1 reduced the expression of CD47
and PD-L1 mRNA and protein as measured by
qPCR and flow cytometry, respectively.
In additional experiments, we found that MYC
shRNA knockdown (fig. S2B) or JQ1 treatment of
four independent primary human T-ALL samples
reduced both CD47 and PD-L1 cell surface expres-
sion (fig. S5). Cisplatin treatment increased CD47
and PD-L1 expression, whereas CD8 expression
was unaffected by the treatments (fig. S5). Last,
we examined publicly available gene expression
data derived from human primary tumors. Nota-
bly, in human HCC, renal cell carcinoma, and colo-
rectal carcinoma, MYC expression significantly
correlated with the expression of both CD47 and
PD-L1 (fig. S6). Thus, MYC regulates CD47 and
PD-L1 expression in multiple human tumor types.
MYC can act as a general transcriptional am-
plifier (that is, it can generally increase expres-
sion of many genes rather than specific target
genes), but dosage-dependent specific effects have
been reported (32–36). We analyzed chromatin
immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) data
from mouse MYC T-ALL cells (34) and the human
B cell line P493-6 (37, 38) and found high levels of
MYC bound to the promoter regions of the genes
coding for CD47 and PD-L1 (Fig. 2C and figs. S7
and S8). In contrast, we observed that both MYC
T-ALL (fig. S7) and P493-6 (fig. S8) cells with
high levels of MYC had lower, often nonspecific,

 binding to the promoters of other cell surface im-
mune molecules such as CD8a and CD25. Onco-
genic levels of MYC bound the CD47 and PD-L1
genepromotersinhumanosteosarcomaU2OS cells,
whereas low levels of MYC did not (fig. S9). In a
nuclear run-on assay with P493-6 cells, MYC induced
expression of the CD47 gene, along with other
well-known target genes such as PDK1, CHEK1,
CDK2, LDHA, and ODC1 (fig. S10, A and B). PD-L1
expression was too low to measure changes in
this experiment. Thus, we conclude that MYC binds
to the promoters and directly regulates the ex-
pression of the CD47 and PD-L1 genes. An alter-
native but not mutually exclusive possibility is that
MYC suppression acutely affects CD47 and PD-L1
surfaceprotein expressionby reducingthe half-lives
of the two proteins. However, we did not observe
the increased turnover of CD47 or PD-L1 proteins
compared with other immune surface proteins in
mouse MYC T-ALL cells when we inhibited protein
synthesis by cycloheximide treatment (fig. S11).
We have shown previously that MYC inacti-
vation in mouse tumor models results in recruit-
ment of immune cells to the tumors (13). To
investigate the role of CD47 and PD-L1 in this
process, we engineered MYC T-ALL 4188 cells to
constitutively express CD47 or PD-L1 (fig. S12A).
In this overexpression system, CD47 and PD-L1
mRNA levels were unaffected by MYC inactivation
(fig. S12B). The recruitment of luciferase-labeled
CD4+ T cells (Fig. 3A), CD69+-activated T cells,
and F4/80+ macrophages (Fig. 3B and fig. S13)
after MYC inactivation was suppressed when CD47
and PD-L1 were constitutively expressed by the
tumor cells. Expression of CD47 or PD-L1 pre-
vented the sustained tumor regression that has been
observed upon MYC inactivation (Fig. 4A), without
affecting MYC expression (Fig. 4B). Enforced ex-
pression of CD47 or PD-L1 increased minimal re-
sidual disease (tumor cells remaining), resulting
in tumor recurrence (Fig. 4, C and D). Conversely,
shRNA knockdown of CD47 or PD-L1 prevented
the growth of MYC T-ALL cells in vivo (fig. S14).
Inactivation of MYC induces tumor regression
through both cell-autonomous mechanisms, in-
cluding proliferative arrest and induction of apop-
tosis, and host-dependent mechanisms, such as
inhibition of tumor angiogenesis and induction
of tumor cell senescence (1–4, 13). We investi-
gated the effect of enforced expression of CD47
or PD-L1 on these mechanisms and found that
CD47 or PD-L1 expression prevented the shut-
down of angiogenesis after MYC inactivation, as
measured by the presence of CD31+ microvessels
(Fig. 4E and fig. S15A) and expression of Ang2
and Tie2 (fig. S15C). The induction of tumor cell
senescence, as measured by b-galactosidase (Fig.
4F and fig. S15B) and p15Ink4b and p19ARF lev-
els (fig. S15D), was also affected, but we did not
observe any effect on apoptosis or prolifera-
tion, as evaluated by annexin V and 7-AAD (fig.
S16A), cleaved caspase 3 (fig. S16, B and D), and
phospho-histone H3 (fig. S16, C and E). Therefore,
the down-regulation of CD47 and PD-L1 appears
to be required for the induction of sustained tumor
regression, the shutdown of angiogenesis, and se-
nescence induction promoted by MYC inactivation.
We conclude that MYC regulation of CD47 and
PD-L1 expression has a direct role in the initiation

Fig. 4. Down-regulation of CD47 or PD-L1 is required for tumor regres-
sion, shutdown of angiogenesis, and induction of senescence upon MYC
inactivation. (A) Survival after MYC inactivation of syngeneic FVB/N mice
that had been transplanted with either MSCV control (gray), CD47-expressing
(blue), or PD-L1–expressing (green) fLuc+ MYC T-ALL cells. MYC was in-
activated when tumors reached 1.5 cm3 (day 0) (n = 5 tumors for control,
n = 10 tumors for CD47, and n = 5 tumors for PD-L1). (B) MYC expression
before (day 0) or after MYC inactivation (day 4). (C) Bioluminescence

 and maintenance of MYC-driven tumorigenesis
(Fig. 4). The overexpression of MYC may be one
general mechanism by which tumor cells up-
regulate the expression of immune checkpoint
regulators, thereby evading immune surveillance.
MYC inactivation has been proposed to restore the
immune response against tumors (fig. S17) (39–41).
The suppression of MYC rapidly resulted in
decreased mRNA and protein expression of CD47
and PD-L1, which suggests a transcriptional reg-
ulatorymechanism.MYCisageneraltranscriptional
amplifierthatcanregulategene expressionthrough
a multitude of mechanisms (32–34). However, as
noted above, MYC also exhibits transcriptional
effects dependent on gene dosage (36, 42). The rel-
atively high levels of MYC expression that are as-
sociated with rapid proliferation and tumorigenesis
may induce CD47 and PD-L1 expression.
Because MYC regulates transcription of their
genes, CD47 and PD-L1 may be expressed at higher
levels in the steady state as compared with other
membrane proteins in tumors. Notably, MYC ac-
tivation of the CD47 and PD-L1 genes appears to
require higher levels of MYC binding to the CD47
and PD-L1 promoters compared with genes in-
volved in normal cell growth; they may, therefore,
represent promoters that have been invaded by
oncogenic MYC levels (33, 42). Thus, these genes
may be particularly sensitive to MYC withdrawal.
Through the suppression of immune surveil-
lance against tumor cells, MYC activation may
influence cancer immunoediting. We propose
that during tumor evolution, high levels of MYC
expression result in increased expression of CD47
and PD-L1, suppressing both the innate and adapt-
ive immune responses and favoring tumor growth
(fig. S17). Upon MYC inactivation, loss of the “don’t
find me” and “don’t eat me” signals allows for the
destruction of residual tumor cells and, conse-
quently, sustained tumor regression.
Although the effects of MYC on the expression
of CD47 and PD-L1 were modest, the consequences
on tumor regression were dramatic, consistent
with reports that small influences on immune
regulators can have marked effects (25). Both
CD47 and PD-L1 may also contribute to the tumor
microenvironment via their influence on T cell
activation and angiogenesis (13, 14, 22, 43–45).
CD47 is the receptor for thrombospondin-1, which
may regulate cellular programs including angio-
genesis, self-renewal, and senescence (13, 14, 45).
We speculate that therapies suppressing MYC
expression and activity may restore an immune
response against human cancers. Humans can-
cers that overexpress MYC may be especially vul-
nerable to an immune checkpoint blockade.

A decline in electron transport chain (ETC) activity is associated with many human diseases.
Although diminished mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate production is recognized as a
source of pathology, the contribution of the associated reduction in the ratio of the amount
of oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) to that of its reduced form (NADH) is
less clear. We used a water-forming NADH oxidase from Lactobacillus brevis (LbNOX) as a
genetic tool for inducing a compartment-specific increase of the NAD+/NADH ratio in
human cells. We used LbNOX to demonstrate the dependence of key metabolic fluxes,
gluconeogenesis, and signaling on the cytosolic or mitochondrial NAD+/NADH ratios.
Expression of LbNOX in the cytosol or mitochondria ameliorated proliferative and metabolic
defects caused by an impaired ETC. The results underscore the role of reductive stress in
mitochondrial pathogenesis and demonstrate the utility of targeted LbNOX for direct,
compartment-specific manipulation of redox state.
A
decline in electron transport chain (ETC)
activity has been linked to numerous hu-
man disorders, ranging from rare genetic
syndromes to common diseases, such as
neurodegeneration, cancer, and diabetes,
as well as the aging process itself (1, 2). How a
decline in ETC activity gives rise to the spec-
trum of observed pathology cannot be readily
explained by a simple deficiency in adenosine
triphosphate (ATP) production (1). A key chal-
lenge in deciphering mitochondrial pathogenesis
stems from the fact that the ETC performs at
