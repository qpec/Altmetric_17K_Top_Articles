and Risk of Acute Pancreatitis
Simon B. Pedersen, BMSc; Anne Langsted, MD, PhD; Børge G. Nordestgaard, MD, DMSc
IMPORTANCE Severe hypertriglyceridemia is associated with increased risk of acute
pancreatitis. However, the threshold above which triglycerides are associated with acute
pancreatitis is unclear.
OBJECTIVE To test the hypothesis that nonfasting mild-to-moderate hypertriglyceridemia
(177-885 mg/dL; 2-10 mmol/L) is also associated with acute pancreatitis.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This prospective cohort study examines individuals
from the Copenhagen General Population Study in 2003 to 2015 and the Copenhagen City
Heart Study initiated in 1976 to 1978 with follow-up examinations in 1981 to1983, 1991 to
1994, and in 2001 to 2003. Median follow-up was 6.7 years (interquartile range, 4.0-9.4
years); and includes 116 550 individuals with a triglyceride measurement from the
Copenhagen General Population Study (n = 98 649) and the Copenhagen City Heart Study
(n = 17 901). All individuals were followed until the occurrence of an event, death, emigration,
or end of follow-up (November 2014), whichever came first.
EXPOSURES Plasma levels of nonfasting triglycerides.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Hazard ratios (HRs) for acute pancreatitis (n = 434) and
myocardial infarction (n = 3942).
RESULTS Overall, 116 550 individuals were included in this study (median [interquartile range]
age, 57 [47-66] years). Compared with individuals with plasma triglyceride levels less than
89 mg/dL (<1 mmol/L), the multivariable adjusted HRs for acute pancreatitis were 1.6
(95% CI, 1.0-2.6; 4.3 events/10 000 person-years) for individuals with triglyceride levels of
89 mg/dL to 176 mg/dL (1.00 mmol/L-1.99 mmol/L), 2.3 (95% CI, 1.3-4.0; 5.5 events/10 000
person-years) for 177 mg/dL to 265 mg/dL (2.00 mmol/L-2.99 mmol/L), 2.9 (95% CI, 1.4-5.9;
6.3 events/10 000 person-years) for 366 mg/dL to 353 mg/dL (3.00 mmol/L-3.99 mmol/L),
3.9 (95% CI, 1.5-10.0; 7.5 events/10 000 person-years) for 354 mg/dL-442 mg/dL
(4.00 mmol/L-4.99 mmol/L), and 8.7 (95% CI, 3.7-20.0; 12 events/10 000 person-years) for
individuals with triglyceride levels greater than or equal to 443 mg/dL (�5.00 mmol/L)
(trend, P = 6 × 10−8). Corresponding HRs for myocardial infarction were 1.6 (95% CI, 1.4-1.9;
41 events/10 000 person-years), 2.2 (95% CI, 1.9-2.7; 57 events/10 000 person-years), 3.2
(95% CI, 2.6-4.1; 72 events/10 000 person-years), 2.8 (95% CI, 2.0-3.9; 68 events/10 000
person-years), and 3.4 (95% CI, 2.4-4.7; 78 events/10 000 person-years) (trend,
P = 6 × 10−31), respectively. The multivariable adjusted HR for acute pancreatitis was 1.17
(95% CI, 1.10-1.24) per 89 mg/dL (1 mmol/L) higher triglycerides. When stratified by sex, age,
education, smoking, hypertension, statin use, study cohort, diabetes, body mass index
(calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared), alcohol intake, and
gallstone disease, these results were similar with no statistical evidence of interaction.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Nonfasting mild-to-moderate hypertriglyceridemia from
177 mg/dL (2 mmol/L) and above is associated with high risk of acute pancreatitis, with HR
estimates higher than for myocardial infarction.

A
cute pancreatitis is a common and potentially fatal
condition.1,2 The prevalence of acute pancreatitis is on
the rise; in the United States, hospital admissions for
acute pancreatitis increased from 4 events per 10 000 person-
years in 1988 to 7 events per 10 000 person-years in 2002.3
Gallstone disease and high alcohol consumption are the lead-
ing causes of acute pancreatitis, while infections, drugs, en-
doscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, and meta-
bolic conditions are more uncommon etiologies.4
Severe hypertriglyceridemia (>885 mg/dL; >10 mmol/L) is
also a well-established cause of acute pancreatitis.5-10 How-
ever, there is no consensus on a clear threshold above which
triglycerides are associated with acute pancreatitis.10,11 Ac-
cording to guidelines from the American College of Gastroen-
terology and the Endocrine Society, triglyceride levels greater
than 1000 mg/dL (>11.3 mmol/L) should be considered a risk
factor of acute pancreatitis12,13; the European Society of Car-
diology and the European Atherosclerosis Society set this cut
point at 885 mg/dL (10 mmol/L),14 and the National Choles-
terol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III recom-
mends triglyceride-lowering therapy when triglycerides are
greater than or equal to 500 mg/dL (≥5.65 mmol/L) to pre-
vent acute pancreatitis.15
We tested the hypothesis that nonfasting mild-to-
moderate hypertriglyceridemia between 177 mg/dL and 885
mg/dL (2-10 mmol/L) is also associated with high risk of acute
pancreatitis. In addition, we examined the association be-
tweenmild-to-moderatehypertriglyceridemiaandriskofmyo-
cardial infarction16 for comparison of effect sizes, as well as be-
tween mild-to-moderate hypertriglyceridemia and levels of
plasma lipase and pancreatic amylase for biochemical sup-
port of our findings. As lipase and pancreatic amylase are the
standard blood test to diagnose acute pancreatitis, high lev-
els of these biomarkers at mild-to-moderate hypertriglyceri-
demia may indicate subclinical acute pancreatitis.
Methods
Study Population
We studied white individuals of Danish descent from the Dan-
ish general population included in 2 similar prospective stud-
ies, the Copenhagen City Heart Study and the Copenhagen
General Population Study, selected randomly based on their
Central Person Register number. The studies were approved
by Herlev and Gentofte Hospital and a Danish ethical commit-
tee,andbothstudiescompliedwiththeDeclarationofHelsinki.
The Copenhagen City Heart Study was initiated in 1976
through1978withfollow-upexaminationsin1981to1983,1991
to 1994, and in 2001 to 2003.17 Data were obtained from a
physical examination, blood samples, and a self-adminis-
tered questionnaire reviewed by an examiner at the day of at-
tendance. We included 17 901 consecutive individuals with a
triglyceride measurement. The Copenhagen General Popula-
tion Study recruited in 2003 through 2015, with an examina-
tion similar to the Copenhagen City Heart Study. We included
98 649 consecutive individuals with a triglyceride measure-
ment. The combined study included 116 550 individuals, in
whom, during a median follow-up of 6.7 years (interquartile
range, 4.0-9.4 years), 434 individuals developed acute pan-
creatitis and 3942 had a myocardial infarction.
End Points
All individuals were followed until the occurrence of an event,
death (n = 17 331), emigration (n = 598), or end of follow-up
(November 14, 2014), whichever came first; we did not lose
track of any individuals. Information regarding diagnosis of
acute pancreatitis (World Health Organization International
Classification of Diseases 8th Edition (ICD-8), codes 577.00,
577.01, 577.08, and 577.09; ICD-10 code K85), chronic pancre-
atitis (ICD-8 codes 577.10, 577.11, and 577.19; ICD-10 code K86)
and myocardial infarction (ICD-8 code 410; ICD-10 codes I21
and I22) was collected by reviewing all hospital diagnoses
and all deaths entered in the national Danish Patient Regis-
try and the national Danish Causes of Death Registry. We
included myocardial infarction as a positive control16 to
assess the validity of the tests performed and for comparison
of effect sizes.
Laboratory Analysis and Covariates
Plasma levels of nonfasting triglycerides (n = 116 550), lipase
(n = 15 856), and pancreatic amylase (n = 92 672) were mea-
sured on fresh blood samples with use of standard hospital as-
says. Blood sampling was not related to an event of acute pan-
creatitis. Nonfasting triglycerides are maximally increased by
26 mg/dL (0.3 mmol/L) after intake of habitual meals com-
paredwithfastingtriglycerides.18-24Lipaseandpancreaticamy-
lase were only measured in the Copenhagen General Popula-
tion Study: 10 085 individuals had measurement of both lipase
and pancreatic amylase, while 206 individuals had no mea-
surement of either lipase or pancreatic amylase. For lipase, no
interference is observed by lipemia up to 1000 mg/dL (11.3
mmol/L)oftriglyceridesandforpancreaticamylaseupto2000
mg/dL (22.6 mmol/L) of triglycerides (lipase and pancreatic
amylase assays; DiaSys).
All patient information on age and sex was complete. In-
formation on other covariates was 99.4% complete. The miss-
ing values were imputed based on age and sex; however, in
analysis only including individuals with complete data, re-
sults were similar to those reported. Assessment of covari-
ates is described in eMethods in the Supplement.
Key Points
Question Is nonfasting mild-to-moderate hypertriglyceridemia
associated with acute pancreatitis?
Findings In 116 550 individuals from the general population,
nonfasting mild-to-moderate hypertriglyceridemia of 177 mg/dL
(2 mmol/L) or higher was associated with high risk of acute
pancreatitis, with risk estimates higher than for myocardial
infarction.
Meaning Mild-to-moderate hypertriglyceridemia is associated
with increased risk not only for myocardial infarction but also for
acute pancreatitis.

Statistical Analysis
We used Stata/SE13.1(StataCorp). Individuals were classified
into 6 clinical categories of triglycerides (<89, 89-176, 177-
265,266-353,354-442,and≥443mg/dL;<1.00,1.00-1.99,2.00-
2.99, 3.00-3.99, 4.00-4.99, and ≥5.00 mmol/L), as done
previously.17 For trend tests using Cuzick nonparametric test
or within Cox regression models, these categories were coded
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 for higher levels of triglycerides.
Hazard ratios (HRs) for acute pancreatitis and myocar-
dial infarction were estimated using Cox proportional haz-
ard regressions models. Age was the time scale using left
truncation (delayed entry), which implies automatic adjust-
ment. We excluded individuals with events before the
examination day: for acute pancreatitis we excluded 506
individuals, leaving 116 044 for analyses, and for myocardial
infarction we excluded 2402, leaving 114 148 for analyses.
Baseline for all included individuals was the date triglycer-
ides were measured.
Cox regression models were adjusted for age and sex, or
for age, sex, and baseline markers of lifestyle and known risk
factors for pancreatitis (ie, for education, smoking, hyperten-
sion, statin use, study cohort, and birth year). We fitted 4 ad-
ditional multivariable adjusted models: 1 further adjusted for
alcohol intake and one for diabetes and body mass index (BMI;
calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters
squared), as these may be on the biological pathway between
hypertriglyceridemia and acute pancreatitis, 1 further ad-
justed for time since last meal, and 1 further adjusted for high-
density lipoprotein cholesterol. We calculated stratum-
specific HRs for acute pancreatitis by performing subgroup
analyses according to diabetes, BMI (<25 vs ≥25), alcohol in-
take (<8 vs ≥8 units/week), and gallstone disease.
Because of random measurement error in the measure-
ment of plasma triglycerides values at baseline, the true asso-
ciation between triglycerides and acute pancreatitis or myo-
cardial infarction is attenuated; this statistical phenomenon is
known as regression dilution bias.25,26 Therefore, HRs and CIs
were corrected for regression dilution bias using a nonpara-
metric method,27 as done previously.17,28 For this correction,
weusedtriglyceridesvaluesfrom4723individualsfromtheCo-
penhagen City Heart Study who attended both the 1991 to 1994
examination and the 2001 to 2003 examination. A regression
dilution ratio of 0.57 was calculated for triglycerides.
Hazard ratios for acute pancreatitis were also calculated
per 89 mg/dL (1 mmol/L) higher levels of triglycerides. To
assess the risk of acute pancreatitis in different subgroups,
we again calculated stratum-specific HRs for acute pancre-
atitis by performing subgroup analyses according to age, sex,
education, smoking, hypertension, statin use, study cohort,
diabetes, BMI (<25 vs ≥25 kg/m2), alcohol intake (women,
<14 [low]/≥14 [high] and men, <21 [low]/≥21 [high]), and gall-
stone disease. Tests for interaction were performed by intro-
ducing a 2-factor interaction term in the Cox regression
model. For the test of interaction of age with triglyceride lev-
els on acute pancreatitis risk, we used years of follow-up as
the time scale. Also, we performed subgroup analyses by
only allowing individuals to enter the Cox regression model
at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years after measurement of triglycerides.
Lipase and pancreatic amylase, were log2-transformed
to approximate normal distributions. The association
between categories of triglycerides and levels of lipase and
pancreatic amylase were examined by general linear models,
adjusted for age and sex or multivariable adjusted for age,
sex, education, smoking, hypertension, statin use, and birth
year. Afterwards geometric mean for lipase and pancreatic
amylase were calculated.
Results
Baseline characteristics of 116 550 individuals from the gen-
eral population by clinical categories of triglyceride levels are
shown in the Table.
Acute Pancreatitis and Myocardial Infarction
The risk of acute pancreatitis and myocardial infarction was
higher as a function of higher levels of plasma triglycerides
(Figure 1). Compared with individuals with plasma triglycer-
idelevelslessthan89mg/dL(<1mmol/L),themultivariablead-
justed HRs for acute pancreatitis were 1.6 (95% CI, 1.0-2.6; 4.3
events/10 000 person-years) for individuals with triglyceride
levels of 89 mg/dL to 176 mg/dL (1.00 mmol/L-1.99 mmol/L),
2.3 (95% CI, 1.3-4.0; 5.5 events/10 000 person-years) for
177 mg/dL to 265 mg/dL (2.00 mmol/L-2.99 mmol/L), 2.9 (95%
CI, 1.4-5.9; 6.3 events/10 000 person-years) for 366 mg/dL to
353 mg/dL (3.00 mmol/L-3.99 mmol/L), 3.9 (95% CI, 1.5-10; 7.5
events/10 000 person-years) for 354 mg/dL to 442 mg/dL
(4.00 mmol/L-4.99 mmol/L), and 8.7 (95% CI, 3.7-20.0; 12
events/10 000 person-years) for individuals with triglyceride
levelsgreaterthanorequalto443mg/dL(≥5.00mmol/L)(trend,
P = 6 × 10−8).CorrespondingHRsformyocardialinfarctionwere
1.6 (95% CI, 1.4-1.9; 41 events/10 000 person-years), 2.2 (95%
CI, 1.9-2.7; 57 events/10 000 person-years), 3.2 (95% CI, 2.6-
4.1; 72 events/10 000 person-years), 2.8 (95% CI, 2.0-3.9; 68
events/10000person-years),and3.4(95%CI,2.4-4.7;78events/
10 000 person-years) (trend, P = 6 × 10−31), respectively. See
eFigure 1 in the Supplement for results before correction for re-
gression dilution bias.
After additional adjustment for alcohol intake, the risk
estimates were similar, while additional adjustment for diabe-
tes and BMI did attenuate risk estimates. Results were similar
when further adjusted for time since last meal (eFigure 2 in
the Supplement), after additional exclusion of individuals
with chronic pancreatitis before baseline (n = 140) (eFigure 3
in the Supplement), and in separate analyses of data from the
Copenhagen City Heart Study and the Copenhagen General
Population Study (eFigure 4 in the Supplement). Results for
acute pancreatitis were similar when further adjusted for
high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, while the association
between triglycerides and myocardial infarction were attenu-
ated (eFigure 5 in the Supplement). We found similar results
in individuals with and without diabetes (interaction, P = .83),
with BMI less than 25 and greater than or equal to 25 (P = .92),
alcohol intake less than 8 units per week vs 8 or more units
per week (P = .93), and in those with or without gallstone dis-
ease (P = .40) (eFigure 6 in the Supplement).

When plasma triglycerides were expressed on a continu-
ously scale, the multivariable adjusted HR for acute pancre-
atitis was 1.17 (95% CI, 1.10-1.24) per 89 mg/dL (1 mmol/L)
highertriglycerides(Figure2).Whenstratifiedbysex,age,edu-
cation, smoking, hypertension, statin use, study cohort, dia-
betes, BMI, alcohol intake, and gallstone disease, the associa-
tion between higher levels of plasma triglycerides and risk of
acute pancreatitis was still significant in most strata (Figure 2).
We found no statistical evidence of interaction in any of the
analyzed strata. See eFigure 7 in the Supplement for results be-
fore correction for regression dilution bias. To exclude re-
verse causation, that is, that acute pancreatitis could cause el-
evated triglycerides, we also performed subgroup analyses by
only allowing individuals to enter the Cox regression model
at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years after the initial start of follow-up and
date of triglyceride measurement: the HRs for acute pancre-
atitis per 89 mg/dL (1 mmol/L) increase in triglycerides were
similar throughout (eFigure 8 in the Supplement).
Absolute Risk for Acute Pancreatitis
and Myocardial Infarction
For acute pancreatitis, the absolute risk from triglyceride lev-
els less than 89 mg/dL (<1 mmol/L) to 89 mg/dL to 176 mg/dL
(1.00-1.99 mmol/L) was higher by 1.6 events/10 000 person-
years; to 177 mg/dL to 265 mg/dL (2.00 mmol/L-2.99 mmol/L)
by 2.8 events/10 000 person-years; to 266 mg/dL to 353 mg/dL
(3.00 mmol/L-3.99 mmol/L) by 3.6 events/10 000 person-
years; to 354 mg/dL to 442 mg/dL (4.00 mmol/L-4.99 mmol/L)
by 4.8 events/10 000 person-years, and to triglyceride levels
greater than or equal to 443 mg/dL (≥5 mmol/L) it was higher
by 9.3 events/10 000 person-years (Figure 1). For myocardial
infarction the corresponding higher absolute risks were 19, 35,
50, 46, and 56 events/10 000 person-years, respectively.
Association Between Triglycerides and Lipase
and Pancreatic Amylase
Baseline characteristics of individuals are shown as a func-
tionofplasmalipaseorpancreaticamylasetertilesintheeTable
in the Supplement.
Higher levels of plasma triglycerides were associated with
higher levels of plasma lipase and with lower levels of pancre-
atic amylase (Figure 3). The multivariable adjusted geometric
mean values for lipase were 28.1 units/L for triglyceride lev-
elsoflessthan89mg/dL(<1mmol/L),29.2units/Lfor89mg/dL
to 176 mg/dL (1.00 mmol/L-1.99 mmol/L), 31.0 units/L for 177
mg/dL to 265 mg/dL (2.00-2.99 mmol/L), 32.6 units/L for 266
mg/dL to 353 mg/dL (3.00 mmol/L-3.99 mmol/L), 32.7 units/L
for 354 mg/dL to 442 mg/dL (4.00 mmol/L-4.99 mmol/L), and
34.0 units/L for triglyceride levels greater than or equal to 443
mg/dL (≥5.00 mmol/L) (trend, P = 2 × 10−23) (Figure 3C). Cor-
responding values for pancreatic amylase were 32.8 units/L,
32.4 units/L, 31.8 units/L, 31.2 units/L, 31.2 units/L, and 29.8
units/L, respectively (trend, P = 2 × 10−57) (Figure 3D). Re-
sults were similar when we excluded individuals with tri-
glycerides levels above the recommended levels for the assay
(eFigure 9 in the Supplement).

creatitis and myocardial infarction.
The mechanism by which triglycerides lead to acute pan-
creatitis is not known. One theory is that at high levels, tri-
glycerides are hydrolyzed by pancreatic lipase producing high
levels of free fatty acids locally in the pancreas.29,30 These will
self-aggregate to micellar structures with detergent proper-
ties, which in turn will damage acinar cells and the vascular
bed inside the pancreas, causing ischemia and inflammation.

Also, it has been proposed that plasma hyperviscosity due to
high levels of chylomicrons (with high content of triglycer-
ides) may lead to impaired blood flow, ischemia, and inflam-
mation in the pancreas.11,31 In accordance, higher levels of tri-
glycerides in rats with acute pancreatitis have been found to
induce inflammatory mediators in the pancreas.32 Further in
support, a Mendelian randomization study33 found geneti-
callymild-to-moderatelyhighremnantcholesterol(highlycor-
related with triglycerides) to be casually associated with high
C-reactive protein levels, and because remnant cholesterol is
highly correlated with triglycerides, this finding suggest that
mild-to-moderate hypertriglyceridemia is associated with
whole-body low-grade inflammation.
Lipoprotein lipase is the key enzyme degrading triglycer-
ides in plasma,34 and mink with hyperlipidemia due to lipo-
protein lipase deficiency (which leads to high levels of chylo-
micronsandtriglycerides)nearlyalwaysdeveloppancreatitis.35
In humans, lipoprotein lipase deficiency leads to the familial
hyperchylomicronemia syndrome with severe hypertriglyc-
eridemia which often, as in mink, leads to acute pancre-
atitis.9,10,34 Interestingly, individuals with the familial chylo-
micronemia syndrome and severe hypertriglyceridemia seem
to be protected against atherosclerotic cardiovascular
disease,34,36wheretheexplanationmightbethattheverylarge
triglyceride-rich lipoproteins cannot enter into the arterial
intima.37 On the other hand, when mild-to-moderate hyper-
triglyceridemia is present, the medium-sized, triglyceride-
rich lipoproteins can enter into the arterial intima where lipo-
protein lipase will degrade triglycerides leading to liberation
of free fatty acids.36 Free fatty acids might then induce inti-
mal inflammation and thus might likely induce inflamma-
tion in atherosclerotic plaques that are possibly involved in

further development of myocardial infarction, as confirmed
in the present study to be associated with mild-to-moderate
hypertriglyceridemia. It might be a similar mechanism that
takes place in the pancreas, where the free fatty acids may lead
to inflammation and thus pancreatitis.36 Interestingly, a meta-
analysis of randomized controlled trials found that use of stat-
ins is associated with reduced risk of acute pancreatitis in pa-
tients with normal or mildly increased levels of triglycerides.38
WhenweadjustedfordiabetesandBMItheassociationbe-
tween mild-to-moderate hypertriglyceridemia and acute pan-
creatitis was attenuated, probably because both diabetes and
obesity lead to higher levels of triglycerides,9,39 and there-
fore, are part of the biological pathway to acute pancreatitis.
There are studies suggesting that diabetes itself, when con-
trolling for hypertriglyceridemia, gallstones, etc, is associ-
ated with high risk of acute pancreatitis.40,41 Therefore, some
mightarguethatourresultsmightbeexplainedbyahighpreva-
lence of diabetes and/or higher BMI rather than high triglyc-
erides. However, because we found similar results in individu-
als with and without diabetes and with a BMI less than 25 and
greater than or equal to 25, it seems unlikely that high preva-
lence of diabetes and high BMI can explain the association ob-
served in the present study between mild-to-moderate hyper-
triglyceridemia and acute pancreatitis. Likewise, our stratified
analyses also found it unlikely that gallstone disease should
be the explanation behind our findings. Finally, because we
obtained similar results even when we excluded individuals
developing acute pancreatitis from 1 to 5 years after triglycer-
ide measurement, it seems unlikely that reverse causality, that
is, acute pancreatitis leading to increased levels of triglycer-
ide, can explain the association observed between mild-to-
moderate hypertriglyceridemia and acute pancreatitis.
In support of our findings, a Swedish prospective cohort
study42 with 33 346 individuals found a HR for acute pancre-
atitis of 1.55 (95% CI, 1.09-2.21) for individuals in the fourth
quartile (≥145 mg/dL; ≥1.64 mmol/L) vs the first quartile (≤75
mg/dL; ≤0.85 mmol/L) of triglycerides. Also, a population-
based study from Scotland43 with 67 269 individuals, with
triglyceride levels 150 mg/dL or less (≤1.7 mmol/L) as the ref-
erence, found HRs for acute pancreatitis of 1.50 (95% CI, 1.14-
1.97)forindividualswithtriglyceridelevelsbetween150mg/dL
and 499 mg/dL (1.7-5.6 mmol/L) and an HR of 3.2 (1.99-5.16)
for triglycerides greater than or equal to 500 mg/dL (≥5.6
mmol/L). Using another approach, a retrospective cohort

study44of41 210individualswithhypertriglyceridemiaatbase-
line found that lower levels of triglycerides during follow-up
were associated with reductions in the incidence of acute pan-
creatitis. Notably, patients whose follow-up triglyceride lev-
els were reduced to less than 200 mg/dL (<2.3 mmol/L) had
the largest reduction in the incidence of acute pancreatitis.
In apparent contrast to our findings, and in support of the
commonly held notion that only severe hypertriglyceridemia
increases the risk of acute pancreatitis, Sandhu et al8 found
in a cohort of 91 patients with triglyceride levels between 885
md/dLand1770mg/dL(10-20mmol/L)thatonly3patientshad
a history of acute pancreatitis, and these 3 all had triglyceride
levels greater than 1770 mg/dL (>20 mmol/L) at the time of
acute pancreatitis.
Also, Linares et al7 showed that 85% of the patients with
acute pancreatitis had maximal triglyceride levels greater than
3000 mg/dL (>34 mmol/L). Both of these retrospective studies
only included individuals referred to lipid clinics and conse-
quently only high-risk individuals. In contrast, we conducted
aprospectivecohortstudyinthegeneralpopulation.However,
our findings may indicate that when a person has triglycerides
of177mg/dL(2mmol/L)orabove,thenthatpersonisatincreased
risk of later experiencing episodes of even higher triglycerides,
and only at such instances will acute pancreatitis develop.
Our finding that high levels of plasma triglycerides are as-
sociated with high levels of plasma lipase is consistent with
that of Steinberg et al45 in patients with type 2 diabetes.
Steinberg et al also found, in accordance with our results, that
only lipase and not amylase was higher with higher levels of
plasma triglycerides. The explanation for this difference might
be that, compared with amylase, lipase remains elevated for
a longer time after pancreatic injury, and lipase is not as af-
fected by chronic pancreatic insufficiency as amylase46,47; in-
deed, chronic pancreatitis might explain the observed low
levels of pancreatic amylase in individuals with mild-
to-moderate hypertriglyceridemia. Alternatively, one might
think that it reflects a combination of: (1) half-life of the en-
zymes; (2) time since last meal; and (3) interference of triglyc-
erides with the lipase assay, because the lipase assay contains
diglycerides and the pancreatic amylase assay does not.
Among the major strengths of our study are the large co-
horts of the general population, the prospective population-
based design, the large number of events, no losses to follow-
up, and the possibility to correct for regression dilution bias
because this correction helps avoid underestimation of risk
estimates.25
Limitations
A study limitation includes diagnostic misclassification. How-
ever, although the validity of acute pancreatitis diagnosis in
the national Danish Patient Registry is estimated to be 82%
(95% CI, 73%-89%),48 such misclassification is likely to be non-
differential to triglyceride levels and is therefore unlikely to
explain the presents results. In addition, we were not able to
retrieve workable information on subtypes of acute pancre-
atitis (alcohol-related, gallstone-related, etc) from the Danish
registries, and for that reason we were not able to compare the
association with hypertriglyceridemia in different subtypes of
acute pancreatitis. Also, lipase and pancreatic amylase were
only available in a subfraction of respectively 16% and 94% of
allindividuals;however,characteristicsinthosewithandwith-
out these measurements were similar.
Conclusions
Mild-to-moderatehypertriglyceridemiaat177mg/dL(2mmol/L)
and above is associated with high risk of acute pancreatitis in
the general population, with HRs higher than for myocardial
infarction. These observations might be useful for forthcom-
ing revisions of guidelines on the management of hypertri-
glyceridemia.
