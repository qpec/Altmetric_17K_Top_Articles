Abstract
BACKGROUND—Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by chronic 
bronchitic and emphysematous components. In one biophysical model, the concentration of mucin 
on the airway surfaces is hypothesized to be a key variable that controls mucus transport in healthy 
persons versus cessation of transport in persons with muco-obstructive lung diseases. Under this 
model, it is postulated that a high mucin concentration produces the sputum and disease 
progression that are characteristic of chronic bronchitis.
METHODS—We characterized the COPD status of 917 participants from the Subpopulations and 
Intermediate Outcome Measures in COPD Study (SPIROMICS) using questionnaires administered 
to participants, chest tomography, spirometry, and examination of induced sputum. Total mucin 
concentrations in sputum were measured with the use of size-exclusion chromatography and 
refractometry. In 148 of these participants, the respiratory secreted mucins MUC5AC and MUC5B 
were quantitated by means of mass spectrometry. Data from chronicbronchitis questionnaires and 
data on total mucin concentrations in sputum were also analyzed in an independent 94-participant 
cohort.
RESULTS—Mean (±SE) total mucin concentrations were higher in current or former smokers 
with severe COPD than in controls who had never smoked (3166±402 vs. 1515±152 μg per 
milliliter) and were higher in participants with two or more respiratory exacerbations per year than 
in those with zero exacerbations (4194±878 vs. 2458±113 μg per milliliter). The absolute 
concentrations of MUC5B and MUC5AC in current or former smokers with severe COPD were 
approximately 3 times as high and 10 times as high, respectively, as in controls who had never 
smoked. Receiver-operating-characteristic curve analysis of the association between total mucin 
concentration and a diagnosis of chronic bronchitis yielded areas under the curve of 0.72 (95% 
confidence interval [CI], 0.65 to 0.79) for the SPIROMICS cohort and 0.82 (95% CI, 0.73 to 0.92) 
for the independent cohort.

 CONCLUSIONS—Airway mucin concentrations may quantitate a key component of the chronic 
bronchitis pathophysiologic cascade that produces sputum and mediates disease severity. Studies 
designed to explore total mucin concentrations in sputum as a diagnostic biomarker and 
therapeutic target for chronic bronchitis appear to be warranted. (Funded by the National Heart, 
Lung, and Blood Institute and others.)
HUMAN AIRWAY SURFACES ARE PROTECTed from the noxious effects of inhaled 
substances by a mucus clearance system that traps deposited materials and clears them from 
the lung.1 A failure of mucus transport, with pulmonary mucus accumulation, contributes to 
sputum production, airflow obstruction, and exacerbations in muco-obstructive pulmonary 
diseases.2–6 One such muco-obstructive disease is chronic bronchitis, also known as chronic 
mucus hypersecretion. Chronic bronchitis is a syndrome that is associated with cigarette 
smoking; it is defined by patient-reported chronic cough and sputum production and, when 
associated with airflow obstruction, is a component of chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (COPD). Despite the importance of mucus accumulation in the pathogenesis of 
chronic bronchitis, a unifying hypothesis that describes the failure of mucus flow with 
consequent mucus accumulation in chronic bronchitis has been lacking, and there have been 
no laboratory methods to confirm a diagnosis of chronic bronchitis.
The mucus that forms the protective barrier on airway surfaces is composed of water 
(approximately 98%), ions, globular proteins, and polymeric mucin macromolecules.1,7 The 
high-molecular-weight (>107 Da) mucin polymers, predominantly MUC5B and MUC5AC, 
provide the biophysical properties required for airway mucus transport and generate the 
perception of mucus as a “gel.”8 In one biophysical model (the “two-gel hypothesis”), it is 
posited that respiratory mucin concentrations govern the rates of mucus transport in the lung 
(Fig. 1A).9 In this model, it is predicted that as mucin concentrations rise, a threshold 
concentration is exceeded, after which mucus transport ceases and adherent mucus plaques 
form on airway surfaces.9 Ultimately, some accumulated mucus may be expectorated as 
sputum. Accumulated mucus that cannot be expectorated serves as the nidus for airflow 
obstruction, inflammation, and intermittent infection.6,10,11 Thus, this model predicts that an 
increased mucin concentration will be associated with sputum production and disease 
severity in chronic bronchitis.
The hypothesis that total mucin concentration is a biochemical hallmark of the pathogenesis 
of chronic bronchitis was tested in an extensively phenotyped cohort of the Subpopulations 
and Intermediate Outcome Measures in COPD Study (SPIROMICS). Associations between 
total mucin concentrations12 and sputum production, sputum characteristics, and disease 
severity, as indexed by means of spirometry and according to exacerbation frequency, were 
tested. Potential etiologic pathways for high mucin concentrations, including cigarette 
smoking and asthma, were also explored. Because previous data suggested that 
overproduction of MUC5B is associated with COPD13 and that overproduction of MUC5AC 
is associated with asthma,14 absolute concentrations of MUC5AC and MUC5B were 
measured in a SPIROMICS subgroup and the relationships of each mucin to chronic 
bronchitis and asthma15 were tested. Finally, the usefulness of total mucin concentrations in 
sputum as an objective biomarker for the diagnosis of chronic bronchitis was explored in 
SPIROMICS participants and participants in an independent cohort.

 METHODS
STUDY DESIGN
SPIROMICS was an observational study that examined COPD in 2981 participants who 
were recruited into four strata: controls who had never smoked cigarettes, current or former 
cigarette smokers without airflow obstruction, current or former cigarette smokers with 
mild-to-moderate airflow obstruction, and current or former cigarette smokers with severe 
airflow obstruction. Current or former smokers had a smoking history of more than 20 pack-
years. Chronic bronchitis was diagnosed by means of questionnaires that were administered 
to participants: one questionnaire reflected the classic definition of the disorder16 (cough 
that is present during most days or nights, is present for 3 consecutive months of the year for 
2 consecutive years, and results in phlegm production), whereas the St. George’s Respiratory 
Questionnaire (SGRQ)17 defined chronic bronchitis as cough and phlegm almost every day 
or several times a week. Emphysema was defined by the percentage of voxels in the lung 
field that showed attenuation of less than −950 Hounsfield units, as assessed by volumetric 
multidetector-row computed tomography (CT) of the lungs. Using this percentage, we 
classified a participant as having emphysema on the basis of normative values.18 Detailed 
clinical definitions are available in the Supplementary Appendix.
Sputum that was induced by inhalation of hypertonic saline was collected from 917 
participants who had a forced expiratory volume in 1 second of more than 35% of the 
predicted value, according to the protocol19 and American Thoracic Society and European 
Respiratory Society standards,16 for measurement of total mucin concentrations. Induced 
sputum samples were placed in a buffer of guanidine (6 mol per liter),12 shipped to the 
SPIROMICS Biospecimen Processing Center, and stored at −4°C. The SPIROMICS 
protocol was approved by the participating universities, and participants provided written 
informed consent. (More information about the study and how to access SPIROMICS data is 
available at www.spiromics.org.)
Data from a questionnaire reflecting the classic definition of chronic bronchitis and data on 
total mucin concentrations in induced sputum were also collected from a single-site, 94-
participant cohort of persons who had never smoked and current or former smokers with or 
without chronic bronchitis. Sputum collection and measurement technologies were identical 
to SPIROMICS procedures.
MUCIN QUANTITATION
Total mucin concentrations in sputum were measured with the use of size-exclusion 
chromatography and differential refractometry. Sputum samples were injected into size-
exclusion columns to isolate mucins, and effluents were passed through a laser photometer 
(DAWN HELEOS II, Wyatt Technology) that was coupled to a refractometer (Optilab T-
rEX, Wyatt Technology). Data were analyzed with the use of ASTRA software, version 
6.1.1.7 (Wyatt Technology). Sputum samples for mass-spectrometric parallel-reaction 
monitoring–based quantitation of MUC5B and MUC5AC were reduced, alkylated, and 
digested with trypsin, and six MUC5B and MUC5AC heavy-labeled peptide internal 
standards were spiked into sputum digests (details are provided in the Supplementary

 Appendix). Samples were subjected to targeted selected-ion monitoring–data-independent 
acquisition analysis with the use of a hybrid quadrupole Orbitrap mass spectrometer with a 
nanospray source (Q Exactive, Thermo Scientific). To assess salivary contamination, 86 
samples were randomly selected from all groups, and salivary protein amylase levels were 
measured with the use of a label-free proteomics approach.20
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Statistical analyses were performed with the use of SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS 
Institute). Total mucin, MUC5B, and MUC5AC concentrations were normalized through 
natural-log transformations. Analyses of variance were used to test the effects of categorical 
variables on total mucin, MUC5B, and MUC5AC concentrations. Pairwise comparisons 
between individual groups were adjusted with the Tukey–Kramer method. No adjustments 
for multiple testing were made. All tests were two-sided, and a P value of 0.05 or less was 
considered to indicate statistical significance. Data are presented as box plots, with bar 
graphs presented in the Supplementary Appendix. The analysis of the usefulness of sputum 
mucin for the diagnosis of chronic bronchitis used receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) 
curve techniques. Additional details about study design, clinical definitions, methods, and 
statistical analysis are provided in the Supplementary Appendix.
RESULTS
PARTICIPANTS
The selection of participants from the entire SPIROMICS cohort for measurement of total 
mucin concentration is described in Figure S1 in the Supplementary Appendix. 
Characteristics of the 917 participants in whom total mucin concentration was measured are 
shown in Table 1, and Table S1A through S1C in the Supplementary Appendix. 
Characteristics of the subgroup of 148 participants in whom absolute concentrations of 
MUC5B and MUCAC were measured are shown in Table S1B and S1D in the 
Supplementary Appendix. Characteristics of the 94-participant, single-site cohort are shown 
in Table S1E in the Supplementary Appendix.
TOTAL MUCIN CONCENTRATIONS AND PHLEGM PRODUCTION AND QUALITY
We first tested the relationships predicted by the two-gel hypothesis between total mucin 
concentrations in sputum and phlegm production and properties (Fig. 1A). Total mucin 
concentrations in sputum were higher in current or former smokers in SPIROMICS who 
reported phlegm production than in controls who had never smoked or current or former 
smokers with no phlegm production (Fig. 1B), findings consistent with the two-gel 
hypothesis. The relationship between mucin concentration and phlegm production remained 
significant after adjustment for smoking status, asthma status, and frequency of respiratory 
exacerbations (Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). Associations were also observed 
between total mucin concentrations and the mucoid, gel-like appearance of sputum and the 
numbers of gel-like plugs in sputum (Fig. S3 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Salivary contamination of sputum can bias measurements of mucin concentration. However, 
mass-spectroscopic analyses of salivary amylase revealed no significant between-group

 differences in amylase values and no correlations between amylase levels and mucin levels 
(Fig. S4 in the Supplementary Appendix).
TOTAL MUCIN CONCENTRATIONS AND DISEASE STATUS
We next tested relationships predicted by the two-gel hypothesis between total mucin 
concentration and disease progression (i.e., increase in severity of chronic bronchitis). Total 
mucin concentrations were associated with airflow obstruction as indexed by the spirometric 
criteria of the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD; 
www.goldcopd.org) (Fig. 1C). For example, the mean (±SE) total mucin concentration was 
3166±402 μg per milliliter in current or former smokers with a GOLD stage of 3 (indicating 
severe COPD) and 1515±152 μg per milliliter in controls who had never smoked. The 
association between mucin concentrations and GOLD status–defined airflow obstruction 
remained significant when the use of inhaled bronchodilator and glucocorticoid treatments 
was included in analysis-of-variance models (P = 0.001). Relationships between total mucin 
concentrations and prospective exacerbation frequencies revealed that mucin concentrations 
were higher in SPIROMICS participants who had exacerbations than in those who had no 
exacerbations (≥2 exacerbations per year, 4194±878 μg per milliliter; >0 to <2 exacerbations 
per year, 2848±171 μg per milliliter; and 0 exacerbations, 2458±113 μg per milliliter) (Fig. 
1D). Similar associations were observed for exacerbations requiring interactions with health 
care providers (Fig. S5 in the Supplementary Appendix).
EFFECT OF EXPOSURE TO CIGARETTE SMOKE AND ASTHMA ON TOTAL MUCIN 
CONCENTRATIONS
Laboratory data suggest that exposure to cigarette smoke decreases the hydration of airway 
surfaces and stimulates mucin production, both of which are predicted to increase mucin 
concentrations (Fig. 1A).11,21–23 In the SPIROMICS cohort, a history of cigarette use, both 
past and current, was significantly associated with total mucin concentration (Fig. 2A).
On the basis of reports that asthma is associated with mucin hypersecretion,1,24 relationships 
between a diagnosis of current asthma and total mucin concentration were tested. 
Approximately 15% of the current or former smokers in the SPIROMICS cohort reported 
current asthma (Table S1C in the Supplementary Appendix), and those participants had 
higher total mucin concentrations than controls who had never smoked (Fig. 2B). The 
influence of asthma on total mucin concentration was maintained after adjustment for a 
history of cigarette use (P = 0.002). Similar relationships were observed for a diagnosis of 
asthma in childhood (Fig. S7 in the Supplementary Appendix). The total mucin 
concentrations of SPIROMICS participants were not significantly associated with asthma 
biomarkers, including sputum eosinophils, blood eosinophils, or blood IgE (Fig. S8 in the 
Supplementary Appendix).
SENSITIVITY ANALYSES BASED ON EXTREMES OF TOTAL MUCIN CONCENTRATIONS
We performed sensitivity analyses that examined current or former smokers with the lowest 
total mucin concentrations (lowest quartile), those with normal concentrations (interquartile 
range), and those with the highest concentrations (highest quartile). These analyses also

 showed that total mucin concentrations were related to phlegm production and disease 
severity (Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix).
ABSOLUTE CONCENTRATIONS OF MUC5B AND MUC5AC
Two observations emerged from analyses of the contribution of the two secreted airway 
mucins to total mucin concentration. First, MUC5B was the dominant secreted mucin in 
control participants, with mean (±SE) concentrations approximately 10 times those of 
MUC5AC (108±20 vs. 10±4 pmol per milliliter) (Fig. 3A and 3B). Second, MUC5B 
concentrations increased proportionately with greater severity of COPD (by a factor of 
approximately 3, to 296±65 pmol per milliliter in current or former smokers with severe 
COPD), whereas MUC5AC concentrations increased disproportionately (by a factor of >10, 
to 108±31 pmol per milliliter in current or former smokers with severe COPD) (Fig. 3A and 
3B). The mean (±SE) ratio of MUC5AC concentration to MUC5B concentration was 
significantly higher in current or former smokers with mild-to-moderate COPD than in 
controls who had never smoked (ratio, 0.5±0.1 vs. 0.1±0.04), but MUC5B remained the 
predominant mucin at all levels of disease severity (Fig. S10A in the Supplementary 
Appendix).
RELATIONSHIPS AMONG MUC5AC CONCENTRATIONS, CIGARETTE SMOKING, AND 
ASTHMA
To assess whether MUC5AC may be a biomarker for asthma in the population of cigarette 
smokers with COPD, relationships among cigarette smoking, asthma, and MUC5AC 
concentrations were investigated. The absolute concentration of MUC5AC and the ratio of 
MUC5AC concentration to MUC5B concentration were higher among current smokers than 
among controls who had never smoked (Fig. S10B and S10C in the Supplementary 
Appendix). This association persisted when participants with asthma were removed from the 
analysis (Fig. S10D in the Supplementary Appendix) and when asthma history was analyzed 
as a covariate (P<0.001 for MUC5AC and P = 0.001 for the ratio of MUC5AC to MUC5B). 
In contrast, participants with current asthma or a childhood diagnosis of asthma did not have 
significantly higher MUC5AC concentrations than those who had never received a diagnosis 
of asthma (Fig. S10E in the Supplementary Appendix), and participants with high MUC5AC 
concentrations did not have significantly higher levels of sputum eosinophils or blood IgE 
than those with normal MUC5AC concentrations (Fig. S11 in the Supplementary 
Appendix).
RELATIONSHIPS AMONG MUCIN CONCENTRATIONS AND DIAGNOSIS OF CHRONIC 
BRONCHITIS
The observations suggesting that total mucin concentrations are linked to the 
pathophysiologic basis of chronic bronchitis raised the possibility that mucin concentrations 
may be an objective biomarker for chronic bronchitis. Total mucin concentrations in sputum 
were significantly higher in participants with either classically defined or SGRQ-defined 
chronic bronchitis than in those without chronic bronchitis (Fig. 4A), as were MUC5B and 
MUC5AC concentrations (Fig. S13 in the Supplementary Appendix).

 The associations between mucin concentration and a diagnosis of chronic bronchitis were 
tested in additional analyses. First, on the basis of data indicating that mucins are produced 
by airways, not alveoli, the hypothesis that the chronic bronchitic component rather than the 
emphysematous component of COPD dominated total mucin concentrations in sputum was 
tested. Participants with classically defined or SGRQ-defined chronic bronchitis, with or 
without CT-defined emphysema, had higher mucin concentrations than participants without 
chronic bronchitis, with or without emphysema (Fig. S14 in the Supplementary Appendix). 
Second, a recent study showed that symptoms, including phlegm production, in smokers 
with normal findings on spirometry identified a population with a chronic bronchitis–like 
phenotype (e.g., respiratory exacerbations and activity limitation).25 In our study, among 
current or former smokers with normal spirometric values, those with symptoms had higher 
total mucin concentrations than those without symptoms (Fig. S15 in the Supplementary 
Appendix).
Finally, the sensitivity and specificity of total mucin concentration in sputum as a biomarker 
for chronic bronchitis were explored in both the SPIROMICS and independent cohorts. With 
the use of data on SPIROMICS participants with classically defined chronic bronchitis and 
healthy controls who had never smoked (Fig. 4A), the area under the ROC curve (AUC) for 
total mucin concentrations versus a diagnosis of classically defined chronic bronchitis was 
0.72 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.65 to 0.79) (Fig. 4B). Data on participants in the 
independent cohort (those with classically defined chronic bronchitis and healthy controls 
who had never smoked) yielded an AUC of 0.82 (95% CI, 0.73 to 0.92) (Fig. 4B). Similar 
relationships were observed when smokers without airflow obstruction were added to the 
control groups (Fig. S16 in the Supplementary Appendix). ROC analyses were also 
performed with respect to the entire SPIROMICS cohort (AUC, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.58 to 0.67) 
(Fig. 4B, and Fig. S17 in the Supplementary Appendix).
DISCUSSION
Chronic bronchitis is defined symptomatically by chronic mucus production and 
pathologically by airway inflammation, mucous-cell metaplasia and hyperplasia, and mucus 
plugging.6,26 Clinically, the presence of the chronic-bronchitis phenotype (as compared with 
its absence) is associated with an accelerated loss of lung function and an increased 
frequency of COPD exacerbations.3–5,27,28
The two-gel hypothesis predicts that a high mucin concentration is the hallmark of the failed 
mucus transport and intrapulmonary mucus accumulation that are central to the pathogenesis 
of chronic bronchitis.9 This hypothesis posits that there are two hydrogels on the airway 
surface (i.e., the mucus layer and the periciliary layer) that compete for hydration as a 
function of their relative osmotic pressures. Because concentrated mucins repel one another, 
the mucin contribution to osmotic pressure does not have a linear relationship with 
concentration but scales to more than the second power of concentration.9 The periciliary 
layer is composed of membrane-tethered mucins and other glycoconjugates and, in healthy 
persons, is the more concentrated hydrogel and functions as a well-hydrated lubricant 
surface. In persons with chronic bronchitis, the concentration of secreted mucins in the 
mucus layer increases, reflecting increased mucin secretion, reduced hydration of airway

 surfaces, or both.11,21,22 When mucus layer concentrations and osmotic pressures exceed 
those of the periciliary layer (i.e., the threshold value), the mucus layer compresses the 
periciliary layer and produces mucus stasis and adhesion.10 Hence, we predicted that mucin 
concentration is the variable underlying the formation of the intraluminal mucus plaques that 
are expectorated with cough.
Data from the SPIROMICS cohort were consistent with this prediction. High total mucin 
concentrations were associated with both patient-reported phlegm production and the gel-
like (mucoid) properties of the expectorated material. High total mucin concentrations were 
also associated with both the classic and the SGRQ definitions of chronic bronchitis, 
findings consistent with the inclusion of phlegm production in these definitions. High mucin 
concentrations were also associated with symptom-based evidence of airway disease 
(including phlegm) in the absence of airflow obstruction.25
The adherent intrapulmonary mucus that is not clearable by cough is predicted to contribute 
to airflow obstruction and exacerbation frequency in COPD (Fig. 1A). Increases in the 
degree of GOLD status–defined airflow obstruction were observed as a function of increased 
mucin concentrations in SPIROMICS participants. Increased mucin concentrations were 
also associated with increased prospective exacerbation frequencies. Because exacerbation 
frequency predicts the degree of airflow obstruction,5 high total mucin concentrations may 
contribute to the loss of lung function in COPD through both intraluminal mucus obstruction 
and increased exacerbation frequencies.
The SPIROMICS cross-sectional sputum analyses allowed testing of associations, but not 
mechanistic links, between mucin concentration and the pathogenesis or severity of chronic 
bronchitis. It should be noted that previous studies involving participants with chronic 
bronchitis related an increase in mucus concentration to a decrease in mucociliary clearance, 
as predicted by the two-gel model.29 The hypothesis that mucin concentration drives the 
pathogenesis of chronic bronchitis is also consistent with data from studies involving animal 
models, which have shown that dehydration of airway surfaces and mucin 
hyperconcentration produced the pathologic changes underlying COPD-like lung disease.10 
Consequently, we postulate that mucin concentration may quantitate the severity of a 
disease-causing pathway in chronic bronchitis and COPD.
The SPIROMICS data showed that having a history of cigarette use or having ever received 
a diagnosis of asthma was associated with high total mucin concentrations, findings 
consistent with previous in vitro, animal-model, and clinical studies.14,21,30 Total mucin 
concentrations did not return to normal values in former smokers, a finding consistent with 
the persistence of airway inflammation after smoking cessation.31,32 The association 
between asthma history and high total mucin concentrations suggests that mucin 
concentration may be a common pathway contributing to the worse outcomes in persons 
with the asthma–COPD overlap syndrome than in persons with either disease alone.33
With respect to the contributions of the two secreted mucins to disease pathogenesis, the 
increase in MUC5B concentration with disease severity is consistent with reports of 
MUC5B predominance in COPD.13 However, the disproportionate increase in MUC5AC

 concentrations with disease severity was striking. The elevation in MUC5AC concentrations 
was dominated by associations with cigarette-smoking status rather than asthma history or 
asthma biomarkers. This finding is consistent with a lower predictive power of asthma 
biomarkers in participants with asthma who smoke than in those who do not smoke34 and 
the dominance in this population of non–type 2 helper T-cell pathways that regulate 
MUC5AC expression.35 Practically, MUC5AC levels may not help define the asthma–
COPD overlap syndrome in a SPIROMICS-like population with COPD.
The associations between total mucin concentration and the pathogenesis of chronic 
bronchitis suggest that this metric may be a quantitative biomarker for chronic bronchitis. 
Total mucin concentrations in sputum were associated with a diagnosis of chronic bronchitis 
based on each of the two types of self-report questionnaires: the questionnaire reflecting the 
classic definition of chronic bronchitis and the SGRQ. The ROC curves for total mucin 
concentration in SPIROMICS participants with a questionnaire-based diagnosis of chronic 
bronchitis versus control participants yielded a “fair” outcome (AUC, 0.72). A similar 
analysis performed in an independent, single-site cohort provided a “good” outcome (AUC, 
0.82). The congruence of ROC outcomes argues for the usefulness of this measure, but the 
lower AUC for SPIROMICS participants suggests that variability among sites may be 
substantial. Future studies to test airway mucin concentrations as a diagnostic and prognostic 
biomarker for chronic bronchitis, as compared with questionnaire-based and airway biopsy–
based metrics for the disease, appear to be warranted; such studies should include younger 
smokers at risk for COPD.36
Our results have therapeutic implications for chronic bronchitis. Higher total mucin 
concentrations (as compared with lower concentrations) were associated with asthma and 
exposure to cigarette smoke, suggesting that targeting upstream components of these 
pathways to inhibit MUC5B and MUC5AC production may be useful. Reports that exposure 
to hypertonic saline diluted mucin concentrations in sputum and accelerated mucus 
clearance in the short term among participants with chronic bronchitis suggest that therapies 
designed to hydrate airway surfaces and reduce mucin concentrations may also be 
effective.21
In conclusion, airway mucin concentrations describe a potential disease-causing, chronic-
bronchitis pathway that is associated with sputum production and disease severity. If 
replicated, our results suggest that airway mucin concentrations may serve as a biomarker 
for the confirmation of the diagnosis of chronic bronchitis and the development of 
therapeutics for the disorder.

 Figure 1. Associations between Total Mucin Concentrations and Phlegm Production and Disease 
Severity in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)
Panel A shows a model representing the progression from normal lung to cigarette smoke–
induced chronic bronchitis. In healthy persons, the balance of active ion absorption (Na+) 
versus secretion (Cl−), passive osmotically entrained water transport, and mucin secretion 
generates a mucus layer with secreted mucin concentrations that are lower than the tethered 
mucin and other glycoconjugate concentrations in the periciliary layer (PCL). The result is a 
well-hydrated PCL and efficient mucociliary clearance (MCC). In persons with cigarette 
smoke–induced chronic bronchitis, an imbalance of ion transport coupled with mucin 
hypersecretion increases the mucin concentration in the mucus layer, producing osmotic 
compression of the PCL, adhesion of hyperconcentrated mucus to airway surfaces, and 
cessation of MCC. The adherent mucus may be expelled as phlegm or sputum by cough. 
Mucus that cannot be expelled by cough continues to accumulate, concentrates, and 
ultimately becomes the basis for airflow obstruction and the nidus for intermittent infection 
or exacerbation. CFTR denotes cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator, and ENaC epithelial 
sodium channel. Panel B shows total mucin concentration in controls who had never smoked

 and who reported no phlegm (59 participants; 10 of 69 participants did not answer the 
questionnaire), current or former smokers who reported no phlegm (397 participants), and 
current or former smokers who reported bringing up phlegm (434 participants). Panel C 
shows total mucin concentrations and spirometrically defined disease severity in controls 
who had never smoked (69 participants) and in current or former smokers with a Global 
Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) stage of 0 (indicating an increased 
risk of disease; 303 participants), 1 (indicating mild COPD; 165 participants), 2 (indicating 
moderate COPD; 293 participants), or 3 (indicating severe COPD; 85 participants). Panel D 
shows total mucin concentration and the prospective annualized exacerbation rate from 
enrollment until the end of the study (defined as the number of days until follow-up or 
death). Rates were classified as zero exacerbations per year (596 participants), more than 
zero but fewer than two exacerbations per year (262 participants), and two or more 
exacerbations per year (36 participants). In Panels B through D, the P values shown but not 
connected by a bracket are for the comparison between the designated group and the first 
group shown. Other significant differences between groups are shown with a bracket. The 
horizontal line in the boxes represents the median, the cross represents the mean, and the 
bottom and top of the boxes represent the 25th and 75th percentiles, respectively. I bars 
represent the upper adjacent value (75th percentile plus 1.5 times the interquartile range) and 
the lower adjacent value (25th percentile minus 1.5 times the interquartile range), and the 
dots outliers. Bar plots of the data in Panels B through D are provided in the Supplementary 
Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. All P values were adjusted 
for multiple comparisons with the use of the Tukey–Kramer method.

 Figure 2. Association between Potential Etiologic Pathways and Total Mucin Concentrations in 
Sputum
Panel A shows total mucin concentration and smoking history. Data are for 69 participants 
who had never smoked, 460 former smokers, and 374 current smokers. Panel B shows total 
mucin concentration and asthma status in participants with COPD (GOLD stages 1 through 
3). Data are for 84 participants with current asthma and 389 participants who had never 
received a diagnosis of asthma. P values are for the comparison with participants who had 
never smoked or who had never received a diagnosis of asthma. The horizontal line in the 
boxes represents the median, the cross represents the mean, and the bottom and top of the 
boxes represent the 25th and 75th percentiles, respectively. I bars represent the upper 
adjacent value (75th percentile plus 1.5 times the interquartile range) and the lower adjacent 
value (25th percentile minus 1.5 times the interquartile range), and the dots outliers. All P 
values were adjusted for multiple comparisons with the use of the Tukey–Kramer method.

 Figure 4. Total Mucin Concentration and Diagnosis of Chronic Bronchitis
Panel A shows total mucin concentrations in current or former smokers who were identified 
as having chronic bronchitis by a questionnaire that reflected the classic definition of the 
disorder (199 participants), current or former smokers who were identified as having chronic 
bronchitis by the St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) (382 participants), and 
controls who had never smoked and were not identified as having chronic bronchitis by 
either questionnaire (58 participants). P values are for the comparison with healthy controls 
who had never smoked. The horizontal line in the boxes represents the median, the cross 
represents the mean, and the bottom and top of the boxes represent the 25th and 75th 
percentiles, respectively. I bars represent the upper adjacent value (75th percentile plus 1.5 
times the interquartile range) and the lower adjacent value (25th percentile minus 1.5 times 
the interquartile range), and the dots outliers. All P values were adjusted for multiple 
comparisons with the use of the Tukey–Kramer method. Panel B shows receiver-operating-
characteristic (ROC) curves for total mucin concentration in participants with classically 
defined chronic bronchitis, as compared with controls who had never smoked, in the 
SPIROMICS cohort (orange curve; area under the curve [AUC], 0.72 [0.65 to 0.79]) and in 
the independent cohort (green curve; AUC, 0.82 [0.73 to 0.92]). The blue curve represents 
total mucin concentration in participants with classically defined chronic bronchitis, as 
compared with all participants without chronic bronchitis, in the entire SPIROMICS cohort 
(AUC, 0.62 [0.58 to 0.67]).

*Plus-minus values are means ±SD. FEV1 denotes forced expiratory volume in 1 second, and SPIROMICS the Subpopulations and Intermediate Outcome Measures in COPD Study.
†Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) stage 0 is defined by a ratio of the FEV1 to the forced vital capacity of more than 0.70 and a cigarette smoking-related increased risk of 
disease. GOLD stage 1, indicating mild disease, is defined as an FEV1 that is greater than or equal to 80% of the patient’s predicted value; GOLD stage 2, indicating moderate disease, as an FEV1 that is 
greater than or equal to 50% and less than 80% of the predicted value; and GOLD stage 3, indicating severe disease, as an FEV1 that is greater than or equal to 30% and less than 50% of the predicted value. 
One participant had GOLD stage 4, indicating very severe disease, and data on GOLD stage were not available for another participant.
‡Current smoking indicates that the participant reported smoking for the 3 months before the baseline visit.
§Chronic bronchitis was diagnosed on the basis of a questionnaire administered to participants that reflected the classic definition of the disorder: cough that is present during most days or nights, is present 
for 3 consecutive months of the year for 2 consecutive years, and that results in phlegm production.
¶Emphysema was defined by the percentage of voxels in the lung field that showed attenuation of less than -950 Hounsfield units, as assessed by volumetric multidetector-row computed tomography of the 
lungs. The presence of emphysema was determined with the use of normative equations.18
