Abstract
A rising incidence of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma
(OPSCC) incidence has occurred throughout the developed
world, where it has been attributed to an increasing impact of
human papillomavirus (HPV) on disease etiology. This report
presents the findings of a multicenter cross-sectional retrospective
study aimed at determining the proportion of HPV-positive and
HPV-negative OPSCC within the United Kingdom. Archival
tumor tissue blocks from 1,602 patients previously diagnosed
with OPSCC (2002–2011) were collated from 11 centers. HPV
status was determined with three validated commercial tests to
provide valid data for 1,474 cases in total. Corresponding nation-
al incidence data from the same decade were obtained from UK
Cancer registries. The overall proportion of HPVþ OPSCC
between 2002 and 2011 was 51.8% [95% confidence interval
(CI), 49.3–54.4], and this remained unchanged throughout the
decade [unadjusted RR ¼ 1.00 (95% CI, 0.99–1.02)]. However,
over the same period, the incidence of OPSCC in the broader UK
population underwent a 2-fold increase [age-standardized rate
2002: 2.1 (95% CI, 1.9–2.2); 2011: 4.1 (95% CI, 4.0–4.3)].
Although the number of OPSCCs diagnosed within the United
Kingdom from 2002 to 2011 nearly doubled, the proportion of
HPVþ cases remained static at approximately 50%. Our results
argue that the rapidly increasing incidence of OPSCC in the
United Kingdom cannot be solely attributable to the influence
of HPV. The parallel increase in HPVþ and HPV� cases we
documented warrants further investigation, so that appropriate
future prevention strategies for both types of disease can be
implemented. Cancer Res; 76(22); 6598–606. �2016 AACR.
Introduction
The developed world has experienced a dramatic rise in
oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) incidence
(1, 2). In England, the age-standardized incidence rate (ASR)
for OPSCC approximately tripled in men (from 2.0 to 5.8)
and doubled in women (from 0.8 to 1.7) between 1995 and

 2011 (3). Associations between tobacco and alcohol consump-
tion and OPSCC are well established (4); however, sexual
behavior is also a risk factor, with lifetime number of oral sex
partners recognized as the behavioral measure most strongly
associated with OPSCC development (5). Changes in sexual
behavior appear to underlie the increasing proportion of
OPSCC attributable to oncogenic human papillomavirus
(HPV; refs. 1, 4, 6). Several North American and European
studies have confirmed sharp rises in HPV-induced OPSCC
incidence, although the exact proportion of HPV-positive
tumors within the total disease burden varies considerably by
geographical region (7–11).
In the United Kingdom, the proportion of OPSCC attribut-
able to HPV has been assessed in several single-center studies;
however, each was small, applied diverse methodology, and
had restricted geographical coverage (12–14). The current pan-
UK study aimed to assess the proportion of OPSCC attributable
to HPV infection in a large contemporary sample (2002–2011
inclusive) using robust, standardized methods. There is a press-
ing need for these data to facilitate health economic analyses
and to inform evidence-based policy making with regard to
prophylactic male HPV vaccination, as has recently been imple-
mented in Australia (15, 16).
Materials and Methods
Case selection
The study received Research Ethics Committee approval (REC
11/NQ/0452). Northern Ireland samples were accessed under
approvals from the Northern Ireland Biobank (NIB 11/001).
OPSCCs were defined as cancers involving the base of tongue
(C01), soft palate and uvula (C05.1 and C05.2), tonsil (C09), and
oropharynx-not-otherwise-specified (C10.9). OPSCC cases diag-
nosed between 2002 and 2011 (inclusive) were collected from 11
recruiting centers distributed across the United Kingdom to
ensure results were not distorted by effects in one area or center
(Belfast, Bristol, Cardiff, Coventry, Edinburgh, Liverpool, Lon-
don, Manchester, Newcastle, Poole, and Southampton). The
overall target sample size (1,710) was sufficient to allow com-
parison of prevalence between years with 7.5% precision. The
number of samples per center was determined pragmatically,
based on the number of cases seen annually at each center. To
avoid selection bias, the first 17 cases per year (11 cases for
Coventry and Bristol) with available formalin-fixed paraffin-
embedded (FFPE) tumor blocks were included (irrespective of
the definitive treatment modality employed). A representative
FFPE block, either from diagnostic or resection specimen, was
selected. Gender, age at diagnosis, year of diagnosis, and histo-
logic diagnosis, including anatomic subsite classification, were
recorded.
HPV testing
Sections of each FFPE block were taken for DNA analysis. To
prevent DNA contamination, the microtome was thoroughly
cleaned between specimens, and a new blade was used for each
block. Tissue microarrays (TMA) were constructed for p16 IHC
and high-risk HPV DNA in situ hybridization (ISH) testing as
described previously (17). Following construction, hematoxylin
and eosin–stained sections of the TMAs were analyzed to confirm
accuracy of sampling. Samples were considered adequate only if
all three TMA cores included tumor.
For PCR, DNA was extracted from 2 � 10 mm FFPE whole
sections by digestion for 16 hours in Tris 50 mmol/L/EDTA
1 mmol/L/Tween 0.5% with 1 mg/mL proteinase K at 56�C,
followed by heat inactivation (100�C for 5 minutes) and centri-
fugation. Extracted DNA was tested for HPV DNA presence using
the Optiplex HPV Genotyping Kit (Diamex GmbH) according to
the manufacturer's instructions. This assay uses Luminex technol-
ogy to detect 24 common HPV types (6, 11, 16, 18, 26, 31, 33, 35,
39, 42, 43, 44, 45, 51, 52, 53, 56, 58, 59, 66, 68, 70, 73, and 82).
PCRs were performed using the Qiagen Multiplex PCR Kit (Qia-
gen GmbH). The assay includes primers for amplification of the
human b-globin gene to confirm sample adequacy. Appropriate
controls were included for sectioning (blank paraffin block), DNA
extraction (reagent blanks), and HPV testing (HPV-positive Caski
cell line DNA-positive control and water-negative control).
p16 IHC was undertaken as a surrogate marker of HPV onco-
gene expression (18) using a proprietary kit (CINtec p16 Histol-
ogy, Ventana Medical Systems) on a Ventana Benchmark Auto-
stainer. p16 IHC was scored as positive if there was strong and
diffuse nuclear and cytoplasmic staining present in greater than
70% of malignant cells (18). All other patterns were scored as
negative.
High-risk HPV DNA ISH was carried out using proprietary
reagents (Inform HPV III Family 16 Probe (B), Ventana Medical
Systems) on a Ventana Benchmark Autostainer. This test detects
high-risk HPV genotypes 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58,
and 66, and tumors were scored as positive if any blue reaction
product colocalized with the nuclei of malignant cells (19). Focal-
specific staining of only part of the tumor section was regarded as
positive. Diffuse staining of tumor and stromal tissues, represen-
tative of nonspecific chromogen precipitate, was scored as neg-
ative. Pale staining limited to the nucleoli of cells and staining of
occasional leucocytes and stromal cells was also disregarded, in
line with the manufacturer's instructions.
All p16 IHC and high-risk HPV DNA ISH testing was under-
taken in UK hospital pathology laboratories holding Clinical
Pathology Accreditation (CPA Ltd.). Both tests are registered in
vitro diagnostic devices for clinical use and as such carry CE
marking, with associated methodologic validation. Test results
were scored by a panel of experienced head and neck pathologists,
all of whom are accredited UK pathologists and members of the
National Head and Neck Histopathology External Quality Assur-
ance scheme administered by the Royal College of Pathologists.
For quality assurance, the panel undertook a calibration exercise
on a training set of OPSCC cases (whole sections and TMAs) prior
to scoring the study material.
HPV status classification
All cases were tested using the three HPV detection assays and
were classified as HPV positive if they showed evidence of both
HPV gene expression (indicated by p16 IHC) and HPV DNA
(indicated by ISH and/or PCR). A diagnostic algorithm utilizing
p16 IHC, HR HPV DNA ISH, and PCR in a stepwise fashion was
applied (19, 20). The results of individual HPV diagnostic tests
and clinically relevant combinations of tests are also reported.
Incidence data
Contemporaneous data on cancer incidence were obtained
from the Office of National Statistics in England, NHS National
Services Scotland, Northern Ireland Cancer Registry, and Welsh

 Cancer Intelligence & Surveillance Unit. ASRs were calculated for
the following groups: oropharyngeal cancers (composed of C01,
base of tongue; C05.1, soft palate; C05.2, uvula; C09, tonsil;
C10.9, oropharynx not-otherwise-specified); laryngeal (C32);
and mouth cancers [IARC definition, comprising C03, gum;
C04, floor of mouth; C05, palate (excluding C05.1, soft palate
and C05.2, uvula); and C06, other and unspecified parts of
mouth], as representative head and neck subsites not associated
with HPV infection (20). ASRs were calculated using the updated
2013 European Standard Population and mid-2012 UK popula-
tion estimates (21).
Statistical analysis
The characteristics of included cases (gender, age at diagnosis,
oropharyngeal subsite, year of diagnosis, and study center) were
described using frequencies/percentages or means/SDs as appro-
priate. Characteristics were compared with excluded cases, and
with Cancer Registry data using t tests or c2 tests as appropriate.
The proportion of HPV-associated cases was calculated for the
whole sample, then for each subset [with 95% confidence inter-
vals (CI)]. Age was the only continuous variable and was cate-
gorized into five groups. The proportion of cases positive by p16
IHC, high-risk HPV DNA ISH, and HPV PCR was also calculated to
allow comparison with studies reporting these endpoints, as was
the prevalence of HPV types among cancers caused by a single
HPV type. Trends in the proportion of HPV-associated cancers
over time were assessed using Poisson regression with robust error
variance (22). This approach was used because ORs (obtained
from logistic regression) are poor approximations of risk ratios if
the outcome prevalence is high. Models were fitted before and
after adjusting for sample characteristics. Finally, HPV-positive
proportions determined in the current study were applied to the
UK incidence data to estimate the burden of oropharyngeal
cancers caused by HPV over the period.
All analyses were undertaken in Stata 14.0 (StataCorp. 2015;
Stata Statistical Software).
Results
Case characteristics
Figure 1 illustrates the application of study inclusion criteria
and the HPV diagnostic testing algorithm. Valid results were
obtained for 1,474 cases obtained from 11 centers. Sample
characteristics (gender, age at diagnosis, oropharyngeal subsite,
year of diagnosis, and study center) are shown in Table 1. The
mean age of patients was 59.3 years, 75.0% of patients were male,
and the majority of cases (57.9%) were tonsil cancers. Invalid
results were obtained for 55 patients, and these were excluded
from the analysis. The age, gender, and subsite distribution was
similar for the included and excluded samples, and excluded
samples were evenly distributed across the study period. The
reasons for exclusion were either the absence of tumor in the
TMA cores or loss of TMA cores during processing for staining.
The age and gender distributions were compared between
OPSCC cases included in the current study, and those reported
by UK Cancer Registries for the same period (Supplementary
Table S1). The study sample included 8.3% of the 17,739 OPSCCs
diagnosed in the United Kingdom from 2002 to 2011. The gender
balance between the current study (75% male) and the UK
OPSCC population (73.5% male) was similar. There was a higher
proportion of younger patients (45–54.9 years) in the study
sample
(30.4%)
than
in
the
OPSCC
population
overall
(25.7%; P ¼ 0.001); however, the age distribution for cases in
the two halves of the study period was similar (2002–2006 vs.
2007–2011, P ¼ 0.5; Supplementary Table S2).
HPV prevalence
The prevalence of HPV infection in OPSCC was 51.8% (95%CI,
49.3–54.4). The prevalence of HPV infection within specific
subgroups is shown in Table 2. The proportion of HPV-positive
cases was higher in men than women (54.3% vs. 44.4%) and
decreased with increasing age (69.2% in patients aged less than 44
years vs. 37.2% in patients aged over 75 years). The mean age of
patients with HPV-positive disease was 57.4 years compared with
61.4 years for HPV-negative cases (P < 0.001). The prevalence of
HPV infection varied depending on the tumor site, with the
tonsil subsite showing the highest prevalence (61.8%) and soft
palate/uvula showing the lowest (9.1%). HPV prevalence also
varied between study centers, from 67.5% (95% CI, 59.7–74.4)
in Liverpool to 35.4% (95% CI, 27.0–44.8) in Belfast. The
variation in the overall proportion of samples defined as
positive by each test (53.7% p16 positive, 45.0% ISH positive,
66.6% PCR positive) is consistent with published literature and
reflects the established sensitivities and specificities of the
assays (12–14).
There appeared to be little variation in prevalence across the 10-
year study period (Fig. 2), either with HPV positives defined using
the stepwise algorithm or for individual tests. Statistical models
were used to assess change in the proportion of HPV-positive cases
per year; the unadjusted risk ratio was 1.00 (95% CI, 0.99–1.02)
for HPV infection for each year compared with the previous year
(Plinear trend ¼ 0.6), and the risk ratio adjusted for gender, age at
diagnosis, anatomic subsite, and study center was 1.00 (95% CI,
0.98–1.03; Plinear trend ¼ 0.7). This confirmed the absence of
change in the proportion of HPV-positive samples over time.
Type-specific HPV prevalence
Among the 764 HPV-positive OPSCCs, the Optiplex HPV
Genotyping Kit identified a specific high-risk HPV type in 732
cases. In 710 (97%) of these cases, a single HPV type was present;
the remaining 22 samples contained DNA of more than one HPV
type. Among cases in which a single HPV type was detected,
HPV16 was present in 684 of 710 cases (96.3%; 95% CI, 94.7–
97.6) and HPV 18 in 11 of 710 cases (1.5%; 95% CI, 0.8–2.8;
Supplementary Table S3). Among cases classified as HPV positive,
HPV 16 and/or 18 were identified in 714 of 764 cases (93.5%;
95% CI, 91.5–95.1). HPV33 was detected in 20 cases (2.6%; 95%
CI, 1.6–4.0); in 9 of these cases, HPV16 was also present.
Incidence of cancers of the oropharynx, larynx, and mouth
(2002–2011) and estimated HPV-associated OPSCC disease
burden
Between 2002 and 2011, the UK incidence of OPSCC increased
by 100.6%, whereas the incidence of laryngeal cancer increased by
9.3% (Fig. 3). The majority of OPSCCs occurred in men (2011
ASR: 6.3 male vs. 2.1 female). Laryngeal cancers were similarly
more common in men than women (2011 ASR: 7.1 vs. 1.3). The
incidence of mouth cancers increased by 45.4%, and there was a
smaller difference in incidence between men and women than
was observed with OPSCCs and laryngeal cancers (2011 ASR: 3.7
vs. 2.4).

 To estimate the burden of oropharyngeal cancers caused by
HPV over this period, the proportions determined in the current
study were applied to the incidence data (Fig. 4). Figure 4 high-
lights increasing incidence of both HPV-positive and negative
OPSCC, especially in men. It was notable that incidence curves for
HPV-negative OPSCCs and mouth cancers show very similar
trends. With regard to non-HPV–associated head and neck cancers
in males, substantial absolute increases in ASR were observed for
HPV-negative OPSCCs, and for mouth cancers, with a smaller
increase in laryngeal cancers (1.72, 1.14, and 0.73/100,000
respectively).
Discussion
This first nation-wide study investigating the prevalence of HPV
in OPSCC within the United Kingdom showed that 51.8% (95%
CI, 49.3–54.4) of cases diagnosed between 2002 and 2011 were
HPV positive. Over the same period, the incidence of OPSCC in
the broader population approximately doubled (ASR 2002: 2.1,
ASR 2011: 4.1), while the relative proportions of HPV-positive
and negative OPSCC remained stable over time. These data
demonstrate a parallel rise in HPV-positive and negative disease
incidence that has not previously been reported and show that, in
the United Kingdom at least, the increasing incidence of OPSCC
cannot be explained solely by an increase in HPV-associated
disease.
The strengths of the study include large sample size, broad
geographical representation, rigorous and systematic case selec-
tion, and use of well-validated commercial tests to identify HPV
tumor status. The results are likely to reflect national trends,
although there is potential for variation in OPSCC incidence,
and in HPV prevalence, between different geographical areas in
the United Kingdom. To assess potential bias in case selection, the
records supplied by each center were formally reviewed. This
showed that FFPE blocks from only 9 patients were unavailable
due to use in other clinical studies. The study group included a
higher proportion of younger patients (45–54.9 years) relative
to the OPSCC population, but given the younger mean age for

 HPV-positive patients, this would be more likely to result in
overestimation of the proportion of HPV-associated disease,
rather than underestimation. The HPV testing regime included
three independent, well-validated, commercial tests (IHC, ISH,
and PCR), performed in independent laboratories, and the three
tests showed highly similar trends in HPV prevalence (Fig. 2). The
analysis of data pertaining to behavioral factors, such as smoking
and sexual history, could potentially have allowed further inter-
pretation of our results; however, due to the retrospective nature
of sample and data collection, these data could not be reliably
obtained.
It is important to stress that conclusions based on the data
presented should not be generalized beyond the United Kingdom.
Substantial variation has been reported in the proportion of
OPSCCs attributable to HPV between countries and time periods
(10, 11). This is likely to be a reflection of variations in multiple
factors, including sexual behavior and rates of genital HPV infec-
tion, as well as tobacco and alcohol consumption. This highlights
that trends in the etiology of OPSCC must be considered in a
population-specific manner. Previous small, single-center studies
from the United Kingdom reported HPV prevalence rates in
OPSCC of 37.5% (95% CI, 28%–48%), 42.7% (95% CI, 36%–
50%), and 55% (95% CI, 45%–66%; refs. 12–14). The current
study is consistent with these but is based on a much larger sample
with broader geographical representation, including centers in all
four countries of the United Kingdom. We observed a consistent
proportion of HPV-positive OPSCCs over time from 2002 to
2011, against a background of increasing incidence. This contrasts
with previous data, detailing an increased proportion of HPV-
positive OPSCCs associated with increasing incidence of OPSCCs
overall (8). Recent data from North America (10) and Stockholm
(23), however, suggest that plateaus in the proportion of HPV-
positive OPSCC and HPV-positive tonsillar squamous cell carci-
noma, respectively, have been observed from the year 2000
onwards.
The absence of change in the proportion of HPV-associated
disease, despite a continued rise in incidence of OPSCC, implies
that HPV-negative OPSCC, traditionally associated primarily with

 smoking (24), is also increasing in incidence. However, this
contrasts with the more modest increase in incidence of other
smoking-related head and neck malignancies, such as laryngeal
cancer (Fig. 3; ref. 25), and suggests that another risk factor, in
addition to HPV and smoking, may contribute to the increased
overall incidence of OPSCC. Prior tonsillectomy appears to
reduce risk of tonsillar carcinoma (26, 27), but although the
current UK tonsillectomy rate is approximately 75% lower than
in the 1950s (28), the absence of a disproportionate increase in
OPSCCs specifically involving the tonsils, in our results and other
published data (25), suggests this is not a major contributory
factor to the increasing incidence of OPSCC. The observed
increases in ASR among the different subsites (non-HPV OPSCC,
mouth, and laryngeal) may reflect the degree of exposure of
specific anatomic sites to individual carcinogens, including
alcohol and tobacco smoke. In an analysis of Dutch HNSCC
incidence, van Monsjou and colleagues (29) suggested that
behavioral changes in the post-World War II generation included
reduced smoking rates coupled with significant rises in alcohol
consumption, and they suggested that excessive alcohol intake
may be a more critical risk factor for OPSCC than smoking. In the
United Kingdom, smoking rates have declined from 46% ofadults
in 1974 to 20% in 2010 (30, 31). However, since 1950, per capita
alcohol consumption has increased from 3.9 L/year to a peak
of 9.4 L/year in 2004 (32). This appears consistent with the
increasing incidence of cancers at sites with greater exposure to
alcohol (e.g., mouth) but smaller increases at sites more strongly
associated with tobacco smoking (e.g., larynx).
It is probable that gender-neutral prophylactic HPV vaccination
could prevent HPV-positive OPSCC (33). Indeed national bodies,
such as the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation in
the United Kingdom, are currently considering extending pro-
phylactic HPV vaccination to include boys, as well as girls. Our
data substantially expand the evidence base available to inform
decisions such as this, particularly when viewed in the context of a
projected substantial continued rise in OPSCC incidence of up to
239% in the next 20 years (34). The current bivalent and

 quadrivalent HPV vaccines protect against infection with onco-
genic HPV types 16 and 18; these types were present in 714 of 764
cases (93.5%; 95% CI, 91.5–95.1) of HPV-positive OPSCCs in our
study. Our data suggest that of the 1,781 cases of OPSCCs
diagnosed in men in the United Kingdom in 2011, approximately
926 were HPV positive, and 866 were associated with HPV types
included in current vaccines.
The parallel increase in both HPV-positive and HPV-negative
tumors should be of concern to those involved in the clinical
management of OPSCC, and to public health officials charged
with developing strategies to reduce incidence. The data presented
highlight that in the United Kingdom, increases in OPSCC inci-
dence are not entirely due to HPV-associated disease. However,
these findings should not be extrapolated to other developed
