Context: Increased prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus and prediabetes worldwide is attributed in
part to an unhealthy diet.
Objective: To evaluate whether 12 weeks of high monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) or fiber-rich
weight-maintenance diet lowers hepatic fat and improves glucose tolerance in people with prediabetes.
Design: Subjects underwent a [6, 6-2H2]–labeled 75-g oral glucose tolerance test to estimate hepatic
insulin sensitivity and liver fat fraction (LFF) using magnetic resonance spectroscopy before and after
intervention.
Setting: Mayo Clinic Clinical Research Trials Unit.
Participants: 43 subjects with prediabetes.
Intervention: Subjects were randomized into three isocaloric weight-maintaining diets containing
MUFA (olive oil), extra fiber, and standard US food (control-habitual diet).
Outcome Measures: LFF, glucose tolerance, and indices of insulin action and secretion.
Results: Body weight was maintained constant in all groups during the intervention. Glucose and
hormonal concentrations were similar in all groups before, and unchanged after, 12 weeks of
intervention. LFF was significantly lower after intervention in the MUFA group (P , 0.0003) but
remained unchanged in the fiber (P = 0.25) and control groups (P = 0.45). After 12 weeks, LFF was
significantly lower in the MUFA than in the control group (P = 0.01), but fiber and control groups did
not differ (P = 0.41). Indices of insulin action and secretion were not significantly different between
the MUFA and control groups after intervention (P $ 0.11), but within-group comparison showed
higher hepatic (P = 0.01) and total insulin sensitivity (P , 0.04) with MUFA.
Conclusions: Twelve weeks of a MUFA diet decreases hepatic fat and improves both hepatic and
total insulin sensitivity. (J Clin Endocrinol Metab 102: 1765–1774, 2017)

 is strongly linked to obesity, prediabetes, and type 2
diabetes.
Diet and nutrition play an important role in the
primary prevention of prediabetes. Weight loss reduces
liver fat (6–8) and is recommended in overweight pa-
tients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)
and insulin resistance (9, 10). Weight loss, with calorie
restriction and/or exercise (i.e., lifestyle changes), has
also been shown to modestly improve glucose meta-
bolism (6, 11–13). Prior studies using isocaloric diets,
either low fat–high carbohydrate or high fat–low
carbohydrate, have shown that liver fat content re-
duced in the former diet compared with the latter, with
either no changes or very minimal changes to total and
peripheral insulin sensitivity (14–19). However, the
studies were of varying design and duration, some
had a very small number of subjects, and some did not
directly assess hepatic insulin sensitivity. Whether
short-term dietary changes in the absence of weight loss
can lower hepatic fat and improve hepatic insulin
sensitivity is debatable.
There is increasing evidence in favor of high
monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) and/or low cal-
orie diets in managing people with type 2 diabetes
regarding improving glycemic control and lowering
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (20, 21).
High-fiber diets have been shown to improve carbo-
hydrate and fat metabolism and prevent type 2 di-
abetes (22). Common dry beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L)
are rich in dietary fiber and have up to 25% of their
dry weight being comprised of protein (amino acids
lysine and leucine) (23). Therefore, in this study we
elected to use a combination of common dry beans and
fiber bars as sources of fiber to mimic a healthy and
acceptable diet.
The purpose of this study was to determine the effects
of a weight-maintaining, short-term isocaloric dietary
intervention with food rich in MUFA or fiber compared
with a habitual diet (control) on hepatic fat content as a
primary aim, and secondarily to explore whether changes
in hepatic fat content impact carbohydrate metabolism in
subjects with prediabetes.
Subjects and Methods
Subjects
After approval from the institutional review board, 55
subjects with prediabetes, as defined by current American Di-
abetes Association criteria, provided written consent to take
part in this study. After screening and a run-in period, 43 (14
normal fasting glucose/impaired glucose tolerance; 8 impaired
fasting glucose/normal glucose tolerance; 21 impaired fasting
glucose/impaired glucose tolerance) of the 55 subjects were
randomized to study. All participants were in good health, had a
stable weight, and were not engaged in exercise programs.
Metabolically neutral medications, such as thyroid medication,
statins, and low-dose thiazides, were permitted. Individuals
with a history of alcohol consumption above the American
Diabetes Association guidelines (i.e., two drinks per day for men
and one drink per day for women) or any chronic medical
condition or any disorder that could potentially impact
the outcome measures were excluded from participating in
the study.
Study design
This was a randomized trial with two interventional groups
consuming additional MUFA (n = 15) or fiber (n = 15) in their
diet and a control group (n = 13), which represented the habitual
diet consisting of high carbohydrate, low fat, and low fiber. The
data analysts remained blinded to the study arms. After an
overnight fast, subjects underwent a 3-hour labeled oral glucose
tolerance test (OGTT) with 4% enriched [6,6-2H2] glucose to
measure hepatic insulin sensitivity. Anthropometric measure-
ments were recorded for all subjects. Body composition was
measured using lunar dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (ver-
sion 11.0; GE Health care Technologies, Madison, WI). Hepatic
fat content was measured using proton magnetic resonance
spectrometry (MRS) by a radiologist blinded to the study. A
Web-based, self-administered, graphical Food Frequency
Questionnaire (Viocare Technology, Princeton, NJ) (24) was
used to assess each subject’s nutritional intake over the previous
3 months. If a subject reported substantial MUFA or fiber-rich
food in their diet at screening, then they were deemed ineligible
for the study. Prior to the dietary intervention, subjects were
instructed to follow a 1-week run-in period on their habitual diet
without olive oil, dry beans, or other fiber-rich foods.
All participants were instructed to follow an isocaloric diet to
maintain a constant body weight (within 2%) during the entire
study. Subjects were required to visit the Clinical Research and
Trials Unit (CRTU) every 2 weeks for weight measurement and
submission of 3-day food records, and to receive the predefined
dietary products (i.e., olive oil, dry beans, fiber bars). The
control group was asked to continue their habitual intake of
food groups, but they were required to come to the CRTU every
2 weeks as well to review their food records and be weighed.
Food records were analyzed for macronutrient consumption
using ESHA Food Processor software, Version 10.11 (ESHA
Research, Salem, OR). Subjects randomized to the MUFA group
were instructed to consume 28% of total energy intake from
MUFA, with 50% of the MUFA coming from olive oil. Subjects
in the fiber group were instructed to consume 20 g of dietary
fiber per 1000 kcal, with a minimum of 1 cup of cooked beans
per day and a maximum of 72 g of dietary fiber per day, with
40% of dietary fiber coming from beans. Bean and olive oil
requirements were individually calculated by a dietician based
on each subject’s daily calorie needs. Subjects were allowed to be
off the diet, if necessary, for up to a maximum of 2 d/wk. Energy
intake was assessed by the dietitians from the 3-day food records
every 2 weeks and by weight measurements taken during CRTU
visits. Extra virgin olive oil or assortment of cooked beans of the
dry bean family were provided to subjects.
Dieticians provided feedback to all subjects by phone based
on their 3-day food record analysis to ensure compliance with
the diet intervention requirements. Subjects were also reminded
at the time of their CRTU visits or during phone calls to not
make any changes to their physical activity during the study

 period. Activity was evaluated using a general practice physical
activity questionnaire at baseline, 8 weeks, and 12 weeks. After
8 and 12 weeks of the diet, all subjects underwent a second and
third labeled OGTT and new anthropometric measurements.
Hepatic fat measurement
Liver fat content was measured using a single-voxel single-
breath–hold proton stimulated-echo acquisition mode magnetic
resonance spectroscopy technique (25). A 2- 3 2- 3 2.5-cm3
voxel was measured in segment VI of the liver, with repetition
time set to 3 seconds to minimize T1-weighting effects, echo time
set to 10 ms to maximize signal, and mixing time set to 5 ms
to minimize J coupling effects. Spectra were acquired both
with and without water suppression. Data were processed using
LC-Model (LCMODEL Inc, Oakville, Ontario, Canada); liver
fat fraction (LFF) was calculated from the sum of the three major
lipid groups referenced to water: (Lip09 + Lip13 + Lip16)/
water (25).
Genotyping
This study also offered the unique opportunity to evaluate
whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) influencing
hepatic fat/NAFLD susceptibility, which were previously
identified by large-scale genome-wide scans or candidate gene
association studies, could be reliably predicted with a small
sample size. These coding and noncoding variants are located in
genes [including Patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing
3 (PNPLA3), Glucokinase regulator (GCKR), and Neurocan
(NCAN)] with known physiologic involvement in carbohydrate
and lipid metabolism in liver (26, 27). In addition, an SNP
located in SREBF-1c, which is a master regulatory transcription
factor involved in lipogenesis, and an SNP located in TCF7L2
gene, which has shown the strongest association with type 2
diabetes susceptibility, were selected for further analysis.
Targeted metabolomics
Targeted metabolomic analyses of fatty acids were done
for triglyceride fatty acid composition and nonesterified fatty
acids, including oleic acids, linoleic acids, palmitoleic acids,
linolenic acids, eicosapentaenoic acids, docosahexaenoic acids,
palmitic acids, arachidonic acids, myristic acids, and tri-
acylglycerol (TAG), as previously established (28).
Analytic techniques
All blood samples were immediately placed on ice,
centrifuged at 4°C, separated, and then stored at 220°C until
analyses were performed. Sample analysis was carried out in
the Mayo Mass Spectrometry or Immunochemical Core
Laboratories. Plasma glucose was measured using a glucose
analyzer (YSI Inc., Yellow Springs, OH), insulin (Access
Ultrasensitive Immunoenzymatic; Beckman Coulter, Brea,
CA), and C-peptide and glucagon using a radioimmunoassay
(Linco Research, St. Louis, MO). Plasma [6, 6-2H2] glucose
enrichment was measured using gas chromatography–mass
spectrometry. Plasma samples were analyzed for fatty acid
concentration (28).
Genomic DNA isolated from blood samples was used for
genotyping on the Sequenom MassARRAY system (Sequenom
Inc., San Diego, CA). Sequenom genotyping procedures were
performed according to the manufacturer’s iPLEX application
guide at the Center for Human Genomics and Personalized
Medicine Core Laboratory (Wake Forest School of Medicine).
Details of all selected SNPs are provided in Supplemental
Table 1. A total of 16 SNPs were successfully genotyped in
this study.
Calculations
Concentrations of glucose are expressed in millimolars, insulin
in picomolars, C-peptide in nanomolars, and glucagon in pico-
grams per milliliter. Concentrations of TAG and lipoproteins are
expressed as milligrams per deciliter. Insulin sensitivity was mea-
sured using the oral minimal model, whereas b -cell responsivity
indexes were estimated using the oral C-peptide minimal model,
incorporating age-associated changes in C-peptide kinetics. The
model assumes that insulin secretion is comprised of a static and
dynamic component (29–31). The dispositionindexwas calculated
by multiplying the total insulin secretion by insulin sensitivity. All
indices of insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity were calcu-
lated per lean body mass. Percent change in LFF was calculated as
100 3 (LFFend 2 LFFbaseline)/LFFbaseline (20).
Statistical analyses
The sample size calculations for the study were designed to
provide 80% power to detect a 30% difference in LFF between
the two modified diets relative to the control group. This cal-
culation was based on a two-sided t test of size 0.05 (i.e., no
correction for multiple testing) and a standard deviation (SD) of
the differences of 25%. The SD of 25% was derived from a
recently published report (15). Accounting for potential drop-
out, we aimed to enroll 16 subjects per group to achieve at least
12 participants at week 12, the minimum number to achieve
80% power.
Sample distributions are described by mean and SD. The
primary outcome LFF at 12 weeks was compared between the
MUFA and control groups and between the fiber and control
groups using analysis of covariance, including the baseline value
as a covariate. Secondary outcomes were analyzed analogously
using analysis of covariance, including the baseline values as
covariates. Emphasis was given to the comparison at 12 weeks,
with the comparison at 8 weeks being secondary. As part of
secondary analyses, within-group changes from baseline to
either 8 or 12 weeks were assessed using a paired t test, except
for LFF, where we used a one-sample t test on the percent change
in LFF. Statistical analysis was done using SAS version 9.4 (SAS
Institute Inc., Cary, NC). A two-sided P value ,0.05 was
considered statistically significant for each outcome measure.
To assess the robustness of the findings because of possible
baseline imbalance, we repeated these analyses including model
terms for sex and lean body mass, and the results remained
qualitatively the same. To assess the robustness of the findings
for insulin sensitivity and disposition index to the skewed
distributions expected for these variables, we repeated the
analysis using log-transformation, and the conclusions were
unchanged.
Bivariate analysis using JMP version 10.0 (SAS Institute Inc,
Cary, NC) was performed to compare the plasma TAG con-
centrations and fatty acids obtained by the metabolomics assay.
Associations between genotypes of SNPs and LFF were tested
using linear regression models (additive and dominant),
implemented in PLINK v1.07 software (Center for Human
Genetic Research, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston,
MA), which included age and sex as covariates. Similar

 associations with triglyceride and hemoglobin A1c were also
tested. All skewed variables were ln-transformed for this
analysis. A P value ,0.05 was considered to be statistically
significant without correcting for multiple analyses based on
strong prior hypotheses and a high correlation between tested
traits. In a secondary analysis, case-control association tests
were also performed. Participants were dichotomized to case
and control based on established clinical cutoffs for liver fat
(32). Individuals with an LFF ,5% were considered to be a
control (n = 11), and individuals with an LFF $5% were con-
sidered to be a case (n = 32). Comparisons of allele and genotype
frequencies between cases and controls were performed using
Pearson goodness-of-fit x2 test and Cochran-Armitage trend test,
respectively, implemented in the DeFinetti program (Institute of
Human Genetics, Munich, Germany).
Results
There were 43 subjects who entered into trial. All 43
subjects (i.e., 15 subjects from the MUFA group, 15
subjects from the fiber group, 13 subjects from the
control group) were included in the data analyses pre-
sented in Table 1 (demographics). However, MRS data
were only available for 15 in the MUFA group, 13 in the
fiber group, and 11 in the control group because of
technical difficulties whereby subjects were unable to
hold their breath appropriately.
Subjects were weighed every 2 weeks and instructed by
dieticians to maintain weight. Baseline, 8-week, and 12-
week body mass index recorded for the MUFA group
were 30 6 3 vs 30 6 3 vs 30 6 3 kg/m2, for the fiber group
were 31 6 3 vs 30 6 3 vs 31 6 4 kg/m2, and for the
control group were 32 6 5 vs 32 6 5 vs 32 6 5 kg/m2,
respectively. Physical activity questionnaire data were
consistent with maintenance of activity in all subjects
from each group throughout the 12-week study period.
Macronutrient composition analyses of the diet for all
three groups at baseline and during the study are shown
in Table 2. The average daily energy intake was not
significantly different between the groups; however, by
design, the MUFA group consumed higher amounts of fat
in the form of MUFA than the control group (P , 0.001),
whereas the fiber group consumed greater amounts of
fiber than the control group (P , 0.001). There were no
statistical differences in carbohydrate content between
the MUFA and control groups (P = 0.09).
Primary outcome
The LFF after 12 weeks of dietary supplementation in
the three groups is shown in Fig. 1. LFF was significantly
lower in the MUFA group (9.7% 6 2.8% vs 8.0% 6
2.5%; P , 0.0003), but remained unchanged in the fiber
group (6.9% 6 1.1% vs 6.3% 6 1.0%; P = 0.25) and the
control group (11.2% 6 2.5% vs 11.9% 6 2.7%;
P = 0.45). For the MUFA group, LFF was reduced
by 218% 6 3% compared with baseline (P = 0.0001) at
12 weeks. Changes from baseline in the fiber group of
2% 6 8% (P = 0.80) and control group of 13% 6 12%
(P = 0.32) in LFF were not significant.
Secondary outcome
Glucose, insulin, C-peptide, and glucagon concentra-
tions during the 3-hour labeled OGTT at baseline and at 8
and 12 weeks after intervention are shown in Supplemental
Fig. 1. Glucose, insulin, C-peptide, and glucagon concen-
trations during the OGTT were not significantly different at
baseline or after intervention in the three study groups.
Indices of insulin secretion and insulin action (hepatic
and extrahepatic) during OGTT are shown in Table 3.
Indices of insulin action and secretion, although numeri-
cally higher, did not significantly differ between the MUFA
and control groups after intervention. However, within-
group comparison of the MUFA group showed signifi-
cant improvement in hepatic insulin sensitivity (P = 0.01)
and total insulin sensitivity (P = 0.04) at 12 vs 8 weeks,
whereas there were no differences between baseline and
8 weeks. On the other hand, in the fiber and control groups,
indices of insulin action or secretion remained unchanged.

 Exploratory analyses
We also evaluated the role of genetic factors in de-
termining the LFF and metabolic profile in this study,
which have previously been established by large genome-
wide scan studies (27). An intronic SNP of the GCKR
gene (rs780094) was significantly associated with the
MRS-derived LFF [b = 0.705 6 0.29; 95% confidence
interval [CI], 0.14 to 1.27; P = 0.019, under a dominant
genetic model] (Fig. 2; Supplemental Table 1). The minor
allele T of this SNP was also associated with an increase in
hemoglobin A1c (P = 0.021) and triglyceride (P = 0.023)
levels. In addition, the frequency of the T allele of SNP
rs780094 was significantly higher in individuals with an
LFF $5% (frequency of T = 0.406) compared with
participants with an LFF ,5% (frequency of T= 0.091),
indicting a strong effect of this SNP in increasing LFF
(odds ratio, 6.8; 95% CI, 1.47 to 31.81; P , 0.006).
Interestingly, the type 2 diabetes2associated allele (T) of
SNP rs7903146 in TCF7L2 was significantly associated
with a decrease in LFF (b = 20.553 6 0.23; 95% CI,
21.01 to 20.096; P = 0.023, under additive genetic model)
(Fig. 2; Supplemental Table 1).
The lipid panel at baseline, 8 weeks, and 12 weeks after
intervention are shown in Supplemental Fig. 1. Of interest,
plasma triglyceride concentrations were numerically lower,
but not statistically significant (P = 0.06), in the MUFA
group after 12 weeks of intervention compared with the
control group.
Targeted metabolite analyses after 12 weeks of in-
tervention showed no substantial statistical difference in
MUFA vs control or fiber vs control diets. Indirect indices
of de novo lipogenesis (DNL) [i.e., serum TAG palmitic/
linoleic acid ratio, steroyl-CoA desaturase activity
(SCD-1) serum TAG palmitoleic/palmitic acid ratio]
were measured.
Ratio of palmitic to linoleic acid concentration (DNL)
did not change after the MUFA diet (0.69 6 0.13 vs
baseline, 0.73 6 0.16; P = 0.5) or the fiber diet (0.75 6
0.01 vs baseline, 0.76 6 0.10; P = 0.7). The SCD-1 ac-
tivity, measured as the ratio of palmitoleic to palmitic
acid concentration, did not change after the MUFA diet
(0.09 6 0.02 vs baseline, 0.09 6 0.02; P = 0.8) or the fiber
diet (0.09 6 0.03 vs baseline, 0.09 6 0.03; P = 0.7).
Discussion
In patients with liver steatosis, a nonpharmacologic
treatment approach has focused mainly on weight loss
strategies and physical exercise (9). However, the present
data show that in the absence of weight loss and vigorous
physical activity, a 12-week diet rich with MUFA sig-
nificantly decreased liver fat content in prediabetes
subjects. Supplementing 28% of total energy intake with
MUFA reduced LFF by approximately 17% after only
12 weeks of consumption of olive oil (Fig. 1).
In this study, all diets were isocaloric, and the subjects
in all groups maintained a constant body weight. Fur-
thermore, subjects were monitored to ensure that they
maintained constant physical activity throughout the
study. Therefore, the reduction of liver fat cannot be
explained by weight loss or exercise, but rather by dietary
changes alone. These data extend those observations by
Bozzetto et al. (19, 20) by showing that an isocaloric diet
enriched in MUFA results in a reduction in hepatic fat

 content (by increasing fat oxidation) independent of an
aerobic training program in people with prediabetes and
in people with type 2 diabetes.
It has been shown that lifestyle-induced weight loss
improves insulin action in prediabetes subjects, but has
no effect on reduction of postprandial hyperinsulinemia
(30). Therefore, we wanted to explore whether changes in
liver fat content would be accompanied by an im-
provement in hepatic insulin action in the absence of
changes in weight.
Insulin action and secretion indices and disposition
index (insulin secretion adjusted for the prevailing degree
of insulin resistance) are presented in Table 3. An MUFA
diet resulted in a numerical increase in all three pa-
rameters from baseline compared with the other diets
assessed, but the differences were not statistically sig-
nificant, likely because of the small sample size and
relatively short duration of the study.
The fiber supplemented group did not show sub-
stantial changes in liver fat content (Fig. 1). Although
fiber supplementation has shown to enhance weight loss
and improve both carbohydrate and fat metabolism (22),
our study provides evidence that in the absence of weight
loss, high-fiber diets do not improve insulin sensitivity or
secretion and do not significantly reduce liver fat in
humans with prediabetes.
Our control diet was a typical Midwestern diet, which
is typically high in fat (mainly saturated) and carbohy-
drates with low fiber content (Table 2). The control group
subjects continued to eat their habitual diet. Although
there is no standardized macronutrient diet composition
for managing type 2 diabetes or prediabetes (33), many
dietary interventions focus mainly on carbohydrate/
calorie restriction. Our study did not find any marked
improvement in glucose tolerance or insulin sensitivity
and secretion after the control diet over the short duration
of this trial, perhaps because this diet closely mimicked
the diet that these subjects typically ate. A recent, ex-
cellent review has been published by Yki-J¨
arvinen (34),
highlighting the various types of diets and their effects on
various metabolic parameters in people with non-
alcoholic fatty liver disease. The current study directly
measured hepatic insulin sensitivity in conjunction with a
dietary intervention. Hepatic and total insulin sensitivity
were significantly improved after he MUFA diet at
12 weeks (P , 0.05), whereas there were no significant

Effect of MUFA on Hepatic Fat in Prediabetes

 changes observed in either insulin action or secretion
indices with the other two diets.
Individuals with prediabetes are frequently overweight
or obese with a sedentary activity level (1). We think this
study has great translational potential in this population. A
therapeutic approach based on MUFA supplementation
seems like an easier goal to achieve than weight loss or
increase in physical activity. Furthermore, exercise with
MUFA supplementation has not been shown to provide
an added benefit compared with MUFA supplementation
alone in decreasing liver fat content in patients with type 2
diabetes (20). We believe it is clinically relevant to study if
dietary interventions (high fiber or MUFA) that have been
purported to be beneficial are relevant in improving meta-
bolic health when compared with the average diet consumed
by most people in the United States. It was not our intention
to compare the MUFA diet with the fiber diet. We did not
note any substantial differences in the outcomes when we
compared MUFA with fiber, but of interest, significantly
lower triglyceride concentrations in the MUFA group
(SupplementalFig.2) wereobservedcomparedwiththefiber
group (P = 0.0082) after 12 weeks of dietary intervention.
Despite the small sample size and short intervention
duration, this study showed that MUFA is somewhat
beneficial in lowering triglycerides, which is a biomarker
for hepatic fat content (35). Consistent with observations
by Bozzetto et al. (19), we did not find any substantial
differences in DNL and SCD-1 activity. Lack of activity
of these two processes suggests that the slightly lower
amount of carbohydrates consumed by subjects in the
MUFA group did not affect the primary end point (i.e.,
lowering of liver fat) because both these indices have been
linked to higher carbohydrate intake (36). The rs780094
SNP in the GCKR gene was associated with liver fat
accumulation and increased triglyceride concentrations
in this study, which confirms the importance of genetic
variants in conveying susceptibility to fatty liver in people
with prediabetes.
As with any study, our study had limitations. A 12-week
dietary intervention is relatively brief; therefore,it isentirely
possible that greater changes may have been seen with a
longer duration of intervention. Moreover, some subjects
had difficulty maintaining breath holds as instructedduring
the liver MRS scans, resulting in data loss.
The isocaloric diet provided in this study resulted in
slight differences in the macronutrient content. The
MUFA group consumed slightly, but not significantly,
lower amounts of carbohydrates (~15 g per meal;
P = 0.09) and (by design) higher amounts of fat in the
form of MUFA (P , 0.001) than the control group,
whereas the fiber group (by design) consumed greater
amounts of fiber than the control group (P , 0.001). All
three groups consumed matched amounts of protein.
Therefore, it is possible that the reduction in liver fat

 observed with the MUFA diet is not solely caused by the
consumption of an increased amount of MUFA alone, but
could perhaps also be because of the slightly lower amount
of carbohydrates consumed by this group. However, we
consider this to be unlikely because of the very small and
nonsignificant
differences
in
carbohydrates
between
groups as previously shown by Yki-J¨
arvinen (34). Addi-
tionally, if we had substantially reduced the carbohydrate
intake (i.e., the so-called low-carb diet), then most certainly
this would have resulted in weight loss that would have
confounded comparison between groups.
In conclusion, we believe this is a pragmatic study and
shows that a short-term diet rich in MUFA can be ben-
eficial in lowering liver fat independently of weight loss
or physical activity in people with prediabetes. Geno-
mic analyses of a relevant SNP in the GCKR gene con-
firmed its importance in hepatic fat accumulation through
increased hepatic triglyceride accumulation. Further studies
with a larger number of subjects and longer duration
of intervention will be required to determine whether
a MUFA-rich diet in the prediabetes population may pre-
vent or slow down the progression of NAFLD to non-
alcoholic steatohepatitis in people with prediabetes to overt
type 2 diabetes.
