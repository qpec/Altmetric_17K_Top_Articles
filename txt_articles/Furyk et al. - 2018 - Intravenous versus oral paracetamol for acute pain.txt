Objective To determine if intravenous paracetamol was 
superior to oral paracetamol as an adjunct to opioids in 
the management of moderate to severe pain in the ED 
setting.
Methods A prospective, randomised, double-blind, 
double-dummy, controlled trial was conducted at a single 
academic tertiary care ED. Adult patients with moderate 
to severe pain were randomly assigned to receive either 
the intravenous paracetamol or oral paracetamol. The 
primary outcome was Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) pain 
reduction at 30 min. A clinically significant change in pain 
was defined as 13 mm.
results 87 participants were included in the final 
analysis, with a median age of 43.5 years and 59.8% 
were female. Overall mean baseline VAS pain score was 
67.9 mm (±16.0). Both formulations achieved a clinically 
significant mean pain score reduction at 30 min, with no 
significant difference between the groups with 16.0 mm  
(SD 19.1 mm) in the intravenous group and 14.6 mm (SD 
26.4) in the oral group; difference −1.4 mm  
(95% CI −11.6 to 8.8, P=0.79). Secondary outcomes, 
including postintervention intravenous opioid 
administration, patient satisfaction, side effects and 
length of stay, did not differ between groups.
Conclusions Overall, there was a small but clinically 
significant decrease in pain in each group. No superiority 
was demonstrated in this trial with intravenous 
paracetamol compared with oral paracetamol in terms of 
efficacy of analgesia and no difference in length of stay, 
patient satisfaction, need for rescue analgesia or side 
effects.
InTrOduCTIOn
background
Pain is a common complaint of patients attending 
the ED, contributing to up to three-quarters of 
presentations and represents a significant burden on 
the healthcare system.1–4 Despite this, pain manage-
ment in the ED has consistently been shown to be 
suboptimal5–7 and may contribute to poorer patient 
outcomes and patient dissatisfaction.
Pain management protocols involve initial pain 
assessment, provision of appropriate analgesia and 
regular pain reassessment.8 Opioids such as intrave-
nous morphine are often recommended as first line 
for severe pain.8 Analgesics such as oral paracetamol, 
oxycodone and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory 
drugs are used as adjuncts or for less severe pain 
presentations. An intravenous preparation of 
paracetamol has been available for 10–15 years, 
although availability in EDs is often restricted.9 In 
the ED setting, intravenous paracetamol has been 
compared with intravenous morphine and other 
active comparators, with conflicting results.10–13 
There is often an assumption of superior efficacy of 
the intravenous preparation due to the pharmaco-
kinetic advantages including higher bioavailability, 
achieving target plasma concentrations faster and 
avoiding the hepatic first pass effect, but compar-
isons with the oral form are limited.9 14 Potential 
advantages of intravenous paracetamol over the oral 
formulation include faster onset of action, greater 
analgesic efficacy and reduced opioid use with less 
opioid associated side effects.14 15 Justification of 
the preferential use of intravenous paracetamol, 
when oral and per rectum routes of administration 
are available, with the prospect of higher costs, time 
and inconvenience and the possibility of compli-
cations with intravenous administration, requires 
evidence of superior clinical efficacy.
Objectives
The objective of the study was to compare the 
efficacy of intravenous paracetamol with oral 
Key messages
What is already known on this subject
 
► Intravenous paracetamol is increasingly used in 
EDs, despite limited and conflicting evidence of 
efficacy in this setting.
 
► Despite a higher unit cost, intravenous 
paracetamol has potential advantages over the 
oral formulation.
What this study adds
 
► This is the first comparison of oral with 
intravenous paracetamol as an adjunct to 
opioid analgesia in the ED setting.
 
► We found a small but clinically significant 
reduction in pain with both intravenous and 
oral paracetamol, but there was no statistically 
significant difference found between the two 
formulations.

paracetamol as an adjunct to intravenous opioids in an undiffer-
entiated group of adult patients in moderate to severe acute pain 
in the ED setting.
MeThOds
study design and setting
A single-centre, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, 
active-controlled superiority trial was performed in the ED 
and short stay unit of a mixed (adult and paediatric) tertiary, 
academic ED in Australia with an annual census of over 85 
000 
presentations per year. The trial was registered with the 
Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry: Trial ID 
ACTRN12615000481572. Patient recruitment occurred from 
April 2015 to February 2016.
selection of participants
Patients were eligible for inclusion if they were ≥18 years old, 
complaining of acute pain corresponding with a Visual Analogue 
Scale (VAS) ≥40 
mm at 5 
min after receiving at least one dose of 
intravenous opioid, as we felt it was unethical to delay opioid 
administration for patients with moderate to severe pain. Patients 
were excluded if they had any medical history that would impair 
accurate pain assessment at the clinician’s discretion, chronic 
pain, known or suspected opiate dependence, allergy to parac-
etamol, any degree of renal or hepatic insufficiency, pregnant, 
currently enrolled in other pain trials, unable to swallow oral 
medication or had taken paracetamol within the last 6 
hours. 
Patient recruitment and enrolment was performed by research 
personnel and ED staff restricted to ED pharmacy hours (07:30 
to 20:00 Monday to Friday and 07:30 to 17:30 on weekends).
Interventions, randomisation and masking
The trial used a double-blind, double-dummy technique in that 
all patients received both an oral and an intravenous preparation. 
Patients were allocated to active 1 
g (2×500 
mg) paracetamol 
(Panadol, GlaxoSmithKline, Ermington, New South Wales, 
Australia) or identical placebo orally AND active paracetamol, 
1 
g intravenous (1 
g per 20 
mL) (Actavis, Macqurie Park, New 
South Wales, Australia) or normal saline, with both intravenous 
formulations administered in 100 
mL normal saline over 15 
min. 
The oral intervention was manufactured by an external good 
manufacturing practice (GMP) licensed facility specifically for 
this study so that placebo and active paracetamol were identical 
in appearance, taste and smell. The intravenous intervention was 
drawn up by the unblinded pharmacy study staff into visually 
identical 100 
mL normal saline bags and generically labelled as 
‘Paracetamol trial - IV paracetamol/placebo’.
The randomisation sequence was produced using a comput-
er-generated program of permuted blocks with varying block 
size, in a simple 1:1 allocation ratio with no stratification by 
a clinical trial pharmacist. A sealed envelope technique was 
used to maintain allocation concealment. Once eligibility was 
confirmed by clinical or research staff, pharmacy was contacted 
by telephone and would select the next corresponding enve-
lope for the allocated intervention. Pharmacy staff would then 
proceed to prepare the intravenous and oral interventions in a 
separate private room with a closed door, to where the patient 
was being treated. Both intravenous and oral preparations were 
then provided to the treating nurse for administration. The phar-
macist had no involvement in patient care or data collection. 
All participants, study staff and treating clinicians were masked 
to treatment allocation for the duration of the study and data 
analysis.
Patients provided verbal consent or assent prior to participa-
tion, and formal written consent was deferred until pain was 
adequately controlled and patients deemed as having capacity 
to provide valid informed consent. Patients discharged from ED 
prior to obtaining written consent were mailed a consent form 
to return to investigators. This process was approved by the 
hospital Human Research and Ethics Committee. Screening logs 
of potentially eligible patients were not kept.
Methods of measurement
Baseline data including VAS score, HR, RR, BP
, oxygen satura-
tion and GCS were entered onto patient case report forms at 
enrolment. Demographic details were recorded from hospital 
databases including gender, date of birth, triage time, chief 
complaint and cause of pain characterised as: abdominal/gastro-
intestinal, musculoskeletal, neurological and other.
Pain scores were assessed using the VAS, a validated tool for 
ED pain research.1 Participants recorded a mark on the 100 
mm 
VAS line to represent a pain score, labelled with ‘0=no pain’ 
and ‘100=worst 
possible pain’. Vital signs, adverse event data 
and VAS scores were collected on a specifically designed data 
collection instrument immediately prior to the administration 
of the study drugs (t=0), then at 15 minutely intervals for the 
first hour and half hourly intervals for the subsequent 3 
hours 
or until the patient was transferred to the ward or discharged. 
Other medications, doses, routes and timing of administration 
were recorded. Patient satisfaction with overall pain manage-
ment was ascertained as a percentage (0%–100%) with higher 
scores representing higher satisfaction, at the conclusion of data 
collection. Data were collected by clinical staff or dedicated 
research staff when available.
All management after the administration of the study medica-
tion was at the discretion of the treating clinician, including the 
administration of further doses of opioid analgesia according to 
hospital protocols.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was the reduction of pain score on the 
VAS from baseline at 30 
min, as a clinically meaningful endpoint 
in which to assess pain for an ED study.16 Secondary outcomes 
were mean VAS score reduction at other time points, occurrence 
of adverse events, rescue analgesia administered (morphine 
equivalents in milligrams), patient satisfaction and length of 
ED stay. An additional secondary outcome of the proportion 
of patients achieving a clinically significant reduction in pain 
score in each group (defined as a reduction of VAS pain score 
of >50% of baseline) was included.
statistical analysis
Power calculation determined that 44 patients were required in 
each group with 80% power and a significance of 0.05% to detect 
a clinically significant difference in mean pain scores of 15 
mm, 
assuming an SD of 25 
mm. The difference of 15 
mm represented 
a compromise between the commonly cited ‘minimum clinically 
significant’ difference of 13 
mm17 and 20 
mm.6 18 To allow for 
attrition and withdrawal, recruitment was aimed at a total of 
100 patients to be split evenly between trial groups.
Data were analysed using SPSS V
.22.0 (IBM, released 2013, 
IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows). The primary analysis was 
performed on a modified intention-to-treat principle, including 
only patients meeting the prespecified moderate pain criterion 
of >40 
mm (figure 1) at time point t=0. Data on all patients 
are also presented. Descriptive statistics were used to describe

the baseline characteristics of the study population. A one-way 
analysis of covariance was conducted to compare the effective-
ness treatment on VAS scores. Levenes test and normality checks 
were carried out and the assumptions met. Differences between 
groups determined using Bonferroni test adjusted for multiple 
comparisons. Repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) 
was used to compare pain scores at different time points. Cate-
gorical data were analysed using the χ2 test. Some authors have 
questioned whether smaller reductions of pain score are ‘clini-
cally meaningful’, particularly for more severe pain at the upper 
end of the VAS.19 Therefore, we performed an additional anal-
ysis of the proportion of participants who achieved a clinically 
meaningful reduction in pain at 30 
min, in both groups, defined 
as a 50% reduction from baseline. Proportions were compared 
with χ2 test. For all analyses, a P value <0.05 was considered 
statistically significant.

Characteristics of study subjects
A total of 142 patients were enrolled in the study, 34 who 
did not have documented written informed consent prior to 
being discharged from the department and did not return the 
mailed written consent form, thus were excluded from the 
analysis, leaving 108 with valid written consent and available 
for analysis. Of these patients, 87 had a pain score >40 
mm at 
t=0 
and were included in the primary modified intention-to-
treat (mITT) analysis20: 47 in the intravenous group and 40 in 
the oral group (see Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials 
 
flow diagram, figure 1).
Baseline characteristics were similar in each group (table 1), 
and mean pain scores at baseline (t=0) were 65.0 (15.8) in 
intravenous group and 71.3 (15.6) in oral group. Mean pain 
scores and SD at 30 
min were 51.5 
mm (22.9) in the intrave-
nous paracetamol group and 54.2 
mm (23.1) in the oral group, 
respectively (table 2). For the primary outcome of pain score 
reduction at 30 
min, difference in pain score reduction was 
−2.6 
mm (95% CI −13.2 to 7.9, P=0.62). Repeated measures 
ANOVA was conducted to investigate the impact of treatment

For secondary outcomes, ‘rescue’ opioids were administered 
in 106 instances in 86.2% of the intravenous group compared 
with 122 instances in 84.1% of the oral group (P=0.69), with a 
median and IQR dose of 5 
mg (2.5–5) morphine equivalents in 
the intravenous group and the oral group 5 
mg (2.5–5.0) equiv-
alent of intravenous morphine (P=0.50). Patient satisfaction 
in the intravenous group was 100.0% (80.0–100) and 90.0% 
(75.0–98.0) in the oral group (P=0.10). Median (IQR) length 
of stay in minutes was also similar between groups: intravenous 
195 (153–232) and the oral group 203 (63–227), difference 
−8 
min (P=0.95). Side effects were infrequent with only one 
report of tachycardia at 240 
min postintervention in the oral 
group and one brief episode of hypotension reported at 45 
min 
in the intravenous group, both not thought to be due to the 
intervention. Time to administration (triage time to interven-
tion administration time) was similar in both groups, median in 
minutes (IQR): intravenous 80 (59–108) and oral 74 (58–100) 
(P=0.35)  (table 3).
In the additional analysis, we found that 25.5% (n=12) in the 
intravenous group and 20.0% (n=8) in the oral group achieved 
significant pain reduction as defined, difference of minimum 
50% at 30 
min (P=0.54) χ2 test. There was no difference at 
time points 60 and 90 
min (online supplementary appendix). 
Results for all consented randomised patients (n=108) 
did not differ substantially from those of the mITT group 
 
(online supplementary appendix).
lIMITATIOns
Our study had a number of important limitations. First, our 
study enrolled a convenience sample of ED patients with acute 
pain, which may have resulted in selection bias. ED pharmacy 
staff prepared study medications, as the planned manufactured 
placebo intravenous preparation was not possible due to diffi-
culty in obtaining a stable and sterile product identical to the 
active preparation and varying escalations in pricing between 
the time of securing funding and commencement of the study. 
Consequently, a pure identical intravenous placebo preparation 
was deemed not feasible, and the study team decided to unblind 
the pharmacy members to progress the trial. This also resulted in 
some delay in the administration of the intervention, which may 
have influenced the effectiveness of the intervention. Measure-
ments were taken from the time of administration (t=0) rather 
than when ordered, which might have negated time advantages 
of more rapid oral administration. The intravenous formula-
tion was administered over 15 
min, compared with immediate 
administration of the oral formulation. Although this seems to 
favour the oral group, this is reflective of usual clinical practice.
Patients were excluded from analysis if they did not have a 
valid written informed consent. Patients provided verbal, implied

consent and assent to study participation during the course of 
the trial; however, the ethics committee prohibited inclusion of 
data without written informed consent. This was comparable 
in both intervention groups, and baseline characteristics were 
similar to included patients. While this may have resulted in a 
loss of power, we do not believe this would have introduced 
systematic bias favouring either group. There were some minor 
imbalances between groups at baseline, which might have intro-
duced some confounding of results. Some ‘eligible’ patients had 
improvements in their pain scores prior to the delivery of the 
intervention. We only included patients who had received opiate 
analgesia, as we did not feel it ethical to withhold analgesia from 
a group for the purposes of a study including a placebo arm. Our 
study used the VAS as a highly reliable and valid pain assessment 
tool in ED research.21 22 However, pain is a very subjective expe-
rience and it is possible the VAS did not capture all clinically 
important data. Due to resource limitations, we assessed patient 
satisfaction crudely on a scale of 0%–100%, which is not a vali-
dated tool, and we acknowledge that other aspects of care, such 
as regular pain assessment, may have influenced satisfaction in 
both groups. Finally, the study was conducted at a single centre, 
and so there is a limit to the generalisability of the results of this 
study.
dIsCussIOn
This is the first study comparing intravenous and oral parac-
etamol for the reduction of pain in the ED setting. Our results 
found both preparations to have only modest analgesic efficacy, 
and we found no superiority of pain reduction for the intrave-
nous preparation in patients with moderate to severe pain.
Some previous research has indicated that intravenous parac-
etamol has a faster onset of action, greater analgesic efficacy 
and longer duration of action, and these conclusions informed 
our hypothesis based on the biological plausibility.23 24 Although 
the intravenous preparation is often anecdotally regarded as 
superior, our results demonstrating no difference are congruent 
with a recent systematic review comparing oral and intravenous 
paracetamol in a variety of settings.9 These authors included six 
randomised trials in the review, only three of which assessed 
efficacy outcomes and all were in the postoperative setting. 
They found no clinically significant difference in efficacy or 
other outcomes. However, these conclusions were based on 
low-quality evidence overall, with methodological limitations in 
all included trials, such as issues with blinding and allocation 
concealment.
Intravenous paracetamol has also compared favourably with 
intravenous morphine in blinded, randomised controlled trials 
in ED settings for renal colic, low back pain and traumatic limb 
pain, although none of these studies could claim superiority 
of intravenous paracetamol.10–12 25 A recent systematic review 
found ‘limited evidence’ to support the use as a primary anal-
gesic in ED setting when compared with opioid and other active 
comparators.13 In our study, we used oral paracetamol as the 
comparator, as we were assessing the efficacy of paracetamol in 
these two formulations as an adjunct to opioid analgesia regimes 
rather than a replacement.
There are a number of possible reasons for the intravenous 
preparation not demonstrating a superior effect over its oral 
comparator. The first is that no clinically meaningful difference 
in efficacy exists or be the result of a type II error. Alternatively, 
heterogeneity in our patient population or prior administration 
of opioid analgesic may have obscured any real treatment effect. 
Later time points in our study suffered from lack of power, with 
fewer patients remaining in the analysis. The ‘National Emer-
gency Access Targets’ in use at the time required that 90% of 
patients leave the ED for admission, discharge or transfer within 
4 
hours,26 thus constraining access to longer-term data.
Historically, the primary barrier to use intravenous parac-
etamol has been one of cost. Recently, however, the patent 
for intravenous paracetamol has expired and it is now being 
produced generically, making it more affordable and accessible. 
Previously, intravenous paracetamol was priced at $A12.22 
per 1 g dose and is now available for $A1.76 per 1 g dose (as 
per I-pharmacy at The Townsville Hospital at time of writing). 
Considering that the average cost of an ED presentation is 
between $A1037 if admitted and $A422 if discharged from 
ED,27 in this context, the cost of one dose of intravenous parac-
etamolis insignificant in real terms and becomes an option 
for this cohort of patients if beneficial. However, intravenous 
administration is associated with other potential disadvantages 
including increased time and inconvenience, indirect costs and 
potential side effects like local infection and phlebitis. The 
absence of benefit makes routine preferential use of intravenous 
paracetamol difficult to justify.
It is important to stress that our study design excluded patients 
who were not able to take oral medications. There may be patient 
groups in whom oral medication is not appropriate or contrain-
dicated where intravenous paracetamol may still be an effective 
analgesic adjunct. Further research may explore patients with 
more severe pain at baseline or specific subgroups of ED patients 
such as traumatic pain.
In summary, our study did not demonstrate the superiority of 
intravenous paracetamol compared with oral paracetamol as an 
adjunct to opioids in a heterogeneous group of adult patients 
with moderate to severe pain in the ED. While these results do 
not support the routine use of intravenous paracetamol in this 
patient group, there may be patients that fall outside the bound-
aries of our eligibility criteria whom may benefit.

IMAGE CHALLENGE
A diagnostic red herring
ClInICAl InTrOduCTIOn
A 29-year-old keen parachutist presented to the emergency 
services in Cyprus complaining of sudden-onset facial flushing, 
dizziness and a widespread rash. The episode began on a hot day, 
1 
hour after she had eaten a breakfast of tinned tuna, and while 
she was ascending in an aircraft to parachute from 10 
000 ft. She 
completed her jump uneventfully. She had no significant medical 
history (figure 1).
QuesTIOn
Based on the history and rash, which ONE of the following is the 
most likely diagnosis?
1. Fish allergy
2. Heat-related eruption
3. Scombrotoxin poisoning
4. Stress-induced urticaria
For answer see page 202
