Abstract
Background: Chikungunya and dengue infections are spatio-temporally related. The current review aims to
determine the geographic limits of chikungunya, dengue and the principal mosquito vectors for both viruses and
to synthesise current epidemiological understanding of their co-distribution.
Methods: Three biomedical databases (PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science) were searched from their inception
until May 2015 for studies that reported concurrent detection of chikungunya and dengue viruses in the same
patient. Additionally, data from WHO, CDC and Healthmap alerts were extracted to create up-to-date global
distribution maps for both dengue and chikungunya.
Results: Evidence for chikungunya-dengue co-infection has been found in Angola, Gabon, India, Madagascar,
Malaysia, Myanmar, Nigeria, Saint Martin, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Tanzania, Thailand and Yemen; these constitute only
13 out of the 98 countries/territories where both chikungunya and dengue epidemic/endemic transmission have
been reported.
Conclusions: Understanding the true extent of chikungunya-dengue co-infection is hampered by current diagnosis
largely based on their similar symptoms. Heightened awareness of chikungunya among the public and public
health practitioners in the advent of the ongoing outbreak in the Americas can be expected to improve diagnostic
rigour. Maps generated from the newly compiled lists of the geographic distribution of both pathogens and
vectors represent the current geographical limits of chikungunya and dengue, as well as the countries/territories at
risk of future incursion by both viruses. These describe regions of co-endemicity in which lab-based diagnosis of
suspected cases is of higher priority.

Background
Dengue is the most important arbovirus in global public
health [1]. It is spread by the bite of the highly anthropo-
philic Aedes aegypti mosquito, and to a lesser extent, by
Ae. albopictus. Over half of the world’s population in-
habit areas at risk of dengue infection [2, 3]. Currently,
the WHO reports its presence in more than 125 coun-
tries [4] and recent modelling suggest as many as 390
million infections occur annually [5]. Dengue fever re-
sults from infection with any of the four closely related
dengue serotypes: DENV-1, -2, -3 and -4. In a minority
of cases, infection can progress to life-threatening condi-
tion such as dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF). Infec-
tion confers protection from subsequent exposure to the
same serotype but does not protect against the others
[6], and sequential infections from other serotypes in-
creases the risk of DHF [7]. Case fatality rates of dengue
infection vary between 0.5 % – 3.5 % [8, 9].
Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an alphavirus also
transmitted by Aedes spp. mosquitoes. There are three
distinct evolutionary clades: West African, Central/East
African and Asian CHIKV [10]. Historically, chikun-
gunya was not considered a life-threatening infection
but recent epidemiological evidence suggests a case fa-
tality rate of around 0.1 % (mostly affecting the elderly)
[11]. A variant of CHIKV first detected in a 2004 Kenyan

 outbreak spread globally through international travel,
leading to autochthonous transmission events in islands
of the Indian Ocean in 2005/6, India in 2005/6 and
Europe in 2007 [12, 13]. This rapid spread of chikun-
gunya demonstrated for the first time both the devas-
tating magnitude of modern-day outbreaks (India was
the worst affected country with over 1.4 million infec-
tions) and the ability of transmission in temperate re-
gions [14–16]. More recently, in 2013, the first case of
locally transmitted case of CHIKV outside Africa, Asia
and Europe was reported in French Guyana; since then,
44 countries in the Americas have reported chikun-
gunya cases in their territories [17].
Both pathogens are transmitted by the same Aedes
spp. mosquitoes and so there is a reasonable expectation
that the epidemiology of chikungunya and dengue infec-
tions is temporally and spatially related. Moreover, be-
cause symptoms presented by infected patients are
similar and diagnosis of both infections is predominantly
symptom-based, there will inevitably be ambiguity in
disease recognition in inhabitants of endemic/epidemic
regions and returning travellers. Therefore, the aims of
this study were to: 1) determine the geographic limits of
chikungunya, dengue and the principal mosquito vec-
tors of both viruses, 2) review the available evidence of
chikungunya and dengue co-infections, and 3) describe
the clinical significance of chikungunya and dengue co-
infection.
Methods
Search strategy for chikungunya and dengue co-infection
A search was conducted in three medical and life sciences
databases (PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science) from
their inception until May 2015 for all relevant articles.
The search terms included were co-infection and concur-
rent isolation along with chikungunya, dengue and break-
bone fever. The specific keywords and connectors used in
the search strategy for each database are listed in S1. Re-
view of bibliographies of papers was also carried out to
ensure completeness of inclusion of all relevant studies.
Study selection for chikungunya and dengue co-infection
Studies eligible for inclusion were those describing de-
tection of both viruses in the same patient. Studies de-
scribing virus detection either through direct methods
(including qPCR) or indirect methods (e.g., immuno-
globulin M and IgG detection with ELISA) were in-
cluded. Papers were excluded if they did not report the
number of co-infected patients; if clinical diagnosis of
dengue and chikungunya was not confirmed by labora-
tory tests; or if data were presented in a non-extractable
format (S2).
Two authors (LFK and SL) independently examined all
the citations by title and abstracts for studies that met
the inclusion criteria. Full-text version articles of all po-
tentially relevant studies were retrieved and independ-
ently extracted. Extracted data were cross-checked by
the same two authors, discrepancies during the selection
of studies or data extraction were resolved through dis-
cussion and consensus following independent evaluation
by another author (GM). The extracted data included
study characteristics (design, location and year) and data
regarding the infection (laboratory method used for
DENV/CHIKV detection, number of cases, isolated
strains of DENV/CHIKV and vector responsible for the
transmission).
Mapping the distribution of Ae. aegypti and Ae.
albopictus and the occurrence of chikungunya, dengue
and co-infection cases
To synthesise current understanding of chikungunya-
dengue co-distribution, we collated global distribution
data for both pathogens as well as for both Ae. aegypti
and Ae. albopictus. By combining data from WHO,
CDC, peer-reviewed literature and Healthmap alerts, we
created up-to-date global distribution maps for both
dengue and chikungunya. This exercise was greatly fa-
cilitated in the case of dengue by the recent dengue
distribution maps produced by Samir Bhatt and col-
leagues (2013) [5]. Additionally, we combined species
occurrence data from three vector databases (European
Network for arthropod vector surveillance for human
public health [VBORNET], Walter Reed Biosystematics
Unit [WRBU] and Global Invasive Species Database) to
provide the distribution of both vectors.
We aimed to identify countries/territories which re-
port both chikungunya and dengue occurrence and to
identify countries/territories that currently have endemic
vectors but no reported local dengue or chikungunya
transmission. Therefore, for mapping purposes, country
level was used except for countries with a total area
greater than 5,000,000 km2 for which province/region/
state-level data were available.
Results
Reported and potential distribution of the viruses and
mosquitoes
Figure 1 shows the global distribution of chikungunya,
dengue and co-infection as well as the principal vectors,
Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus. A total of 154 (Fig. 1-top
left panel) and 99 (Fig. 1-top right panel) countries/terri-
tories were found that reported endemic/epidemic den-
gue and chikungunya, respectively. Of the 98 countries/
territories with reported local transmission for both chi-
kungunya and dengue, only 13 have recorded co-
infections (Fig. 1-bottom left panel). Fifty-six countries/
territories are currently known to have endemic/epi-
demic dengue but are lacking evidence for ever having

 had local chikungunya transmission. One hundred and
seventy-four countries/territories were found to have en-
demic Ae. aegypti populations and 88 countries/territor-
ies have Ae. albopictus. Only 68 countries/territories
reported the presence of both vector species (Fig. 1-bot-
tom right panel; Additional file 1: S3).
Regarding transmission, Ae. aegypti has historically
been understood to be the vector of greatest public health
significance for both DENV and CHIKV. We found no
evidence for a substantial role of any alternative vector
species prior to 2004. Although Ae. aegypti constituted
the main vector species in Kenya during the major 2004
outbreak [51, 52], Ae. albopictus was the principal vector
in succeeding epidemics in Gabon [30, 31], Madagascar
[25] and La Reunion [53].
Chikungunya strains isolated from La Reunion were
found to have a mutation at position 226 in the E1
envelope glycoprotein resulting in a significant in-
crease in the infectivity of the virus to Ae. albopictus
[54]. This vector species facilitated the 2007 autoch-
thonous transmission of chikungunya in Italy follow-
ing the virus’ introduction from a traveller returning
from
India
[55],
and
may
also
be
an
important
contributor
to the recent chikungunya-dengue
co-
infections found in the Americas [47]. Vazeille et al.
(2010) showed for the first time in an artificial infec-
tion experiment that the same Ae. albopictus mos-
quito could simultaneously be infected with CHIKV
and DENV [56]. Subsequently, a naturally co-infected
Ae. albopictus was discovered during the 2010 out-
break of both viruses in Gabon [30].
Among the studies that reported DENV/CHIKV co-
infection only five studies conducted entomological
surveys to assess the vector(s) involved in co-infection
[20, 23, 25, 30, 31]. In the South-East Asian region, Ae.
aegypti was the primary vector involved in the co-
infection cases from 1964 in India [20] and 1970–72 in
Myanmar [23]; whereas in the African region, Ae. albo-
pictus was the responsible vector in Madagascar (2006)
[25] and Gabon (2007-10) [30, 31]. Although, specific
Aedes spp are known to be predominant in certain re-
gions (e.g. Ae. aegypti in India), we cannot retrospect-
ively ascertain which species was responsible for the
spread of DENV/CHIKV in the remaining studies
which did not report contemporaneous entomological
surveys, due to the rapid changing distribution of both
arbovirus vectors [57]. Caron et al. detected three Aedes
spp. present in Gabon; however, only Ae. albopictus
was found to be positive for both viruses, while Ae.
aegypti was positive for CHIKV and Ae. simpsoni tested
negative for DENV and CHIKV [30].
Evidence of chikungunya-dengue co-infection
A total of 30 eligible studies were selected out of 129
identified in the combined search for chikungunya-
dengue co-infection (S2). Reporting of chikungunya-
dengue co-infection cases clearly depicts the spread
of both viruses across countries/continents over time.

 The first cases of dengue-chikungunya co-infection
were reported in Thailand by Nimmannitya et al. who
detected four co-infected cases among 150 patients diag-
nosed with either dengue or chikungunya (2.6 %) in
1962; three co-infected cases out of 144 infected patients
(2.1 %) in 1963; and 12 co-infected cases out of 334 in-
fected patients (3.6 %) in 1964 [18]. In 1964, co-infection
cases were also reported in south India [19, 20] during a
spate of chikungunya epidemics spanning 1963–1973
[21]. One hundred and ninety-five out of 372 patients
presenting dengue-like illness were found to be chikun-
gunya positive, one positive for DENV-1 and three
positive for DENV-2 [19]. Among the patients with
dengue-like illness, 2 % presented chikungunya-dengue
co-infection [19, 20]. Recent phylogenetic analysis,
based on the Alphavirus genus–specific NS4 gene, re-
vealed the Indian CHIKV to be highly related (same
within-clade cluster) to the Asian genotype responsible
for the contemporaneous Thai outbreaks [22].
Active surveillance in the Children’s Hospital, Yangon
General Hospital and the Defence Services Hospital in
Myanmar identified 36 out of 539 (6.7 %) dengue and/
or chikungunya positive patients to be co-infected in
1970; eight out of 129 (6.2 %) in 1971; and 11 out of
244 (4.5 %) in 1972 [23]. Following the studies report-
ing chikungunya-dengue co-infection in Thailand [18],
India [19, 20] and Myanmar [23], no reports were
found of chikungunya-dengue co-infection for more
than 30 years despite sustained CHIKV and DENV en-
demicity in Africa and Asia.
In 2004, an outbreak of a new strain of chikungunya
occurred in Lamu and then Mombasa on the Kenyan
coast. Normally maintained in a sylvatic cycle in Kenya,
this newly emergent strain from the Central/East African
clade reached a very high attack rate of 75 % in the im-
munologically
naïve
local
human
populations
[11].
Through international travel and transport of goods
[24], it subsequently spread to islands of the Indian
Ocean, India and South-East Asia. Consequently, in
2006 chikungunya-dengue co-infections were identified
in Madagascar [25], Sri Lanka [26, 27], India [28] and
Malaysia [29]. Between 2006 and 2012, numerous stud-
ies reported concurrent chikungunya-dengue infection
during CHIKV or DENV outbreaks in Africa [30–32],
South-East Asia [33–44], Eastern Mediterranean [45]
and the Western Pacific region [46]. In December 2013,
the first autochthonous case of chikungunya was re-
ported in the Caribbean island of Saint Martin, and co-
incided with a dengue epidemic resulting in the first
sixteen documented co-infected cases for the Americas
[47]. Although, further cases of co-infection have not
been reported in America, co-infection cases persist in
Africa [48, 49] and South-East Asia [50]. A chronology
of chikungunya-dengue co-infection reports by region/
country, along with prevalence estimates between 1962
and 2015 is shown in Table 1.
Impact on diagnosis and clinical outcomes
The progression of infection and symptoms for both chi-
kungunya and dengue are shown in Fig. 2. Given that
the symptoms associated with the acute phase of dengue
mono-infection are often indistinguishable from those
presented by patients with chikungunya infection [58],
confirmatory laboratory diagnosis is required for appro-
priate treatment recommendation.
Detection of the viruses
The virus can be isolated during early stage infection by
inoculating diagnostic samples into mosquitoes, mos-
quito cell lines, mammalian cell lines or the cerebra of
suckling mice, and these were the methods generally
used in the earlier studies [18–20, 23]. However, these
methods are technically demanding, time consuming (up
to a week), expensive and not very sensitive [61], and
have consequently been superseded, in large part, by
molecular methods. Most modern (post-2004) studies of
co-infection have employed RT-PCR methods to detect
viral nucleic acid because of improved sensitivity and
rapidity (results are typically available within 1-2 days)
[62, 63]. These methods were often complemented with
immunoglobulin M and/or IgG detection or seroconver-
sion using ELISA [25, 41, 45, 47, 64]. The indirect detec-
tion is easily performed but has sensitivities that are
variable according to the stage of infection and the pa-
tient’s history of pathogen exposure [65].
While virus is only detectable within the first few days
of symptoms onset (Fig. 2), antibodies take longer to de-
velop and accumulate to detectable levels [65]. This
transition in appropriate laboratory diagnostics accord-
ing to temporality of infection is reflected in the dengue
case investigation reporting procedure of the CDC, and
discussed in a recent CDC expert commentary [66].
Clinical significance of co-infection
In terms of clinical outcome, only four studies have de-
scribed the severity of dengue-chikungunya co-infection
[28, 33, 38, 47]. Three studies indicated that neither
symptoms nor clinical outcome were exacerbated by
co-infection (relative to monotypic infection). Only
Chahar et al. described a high rate of severe symptoms
and poor clinical outcomes among co-infected patients
[28]. Among the 6 co-infected patients, 2 developed
DHF with central nervous system involvement and 1
ultimately died [28]. It is worth highlighting that the
majority of dengue infections diagnosed during this lat-
ter study were secondary infections which may be asso-
ciated with the observed high rates of severe disease
without chikungunya involvement. Furthermore, no

Discussion
We are witnessing a rapid expansion in the geographical
extent of chikungunya which mirrors that of dengue as
described by Gubler in the 1990s [67]. This has come
about partly through the increased opportunity for
pathogen and vector spread that has resulted from glo-
balisation [68], and the multifaceted effects on infectious
diseases of a growing human population with resultant
environmental changes [69]. Perhaps equally important,
however, is the reporting bias that has obscured the pub-
lic health impact of this pathogen, from its discovery
until quite recently; CHIKV was first isolated in 1953
from the serum of a suspected dengue patient [70] and
its conflation with dengue has persisted. Of the 30 stud-
ies eligible for inclusion in the current review, only one
arose from an investigation of dengue cases, indicating a
conspicuous absence of chikungunya diagnoses when
dengue is suspected. Synthesising the available literature
on chikungunya and dengue co-infection has revealed
several limitations in our current understanding of the
epidemiology of coinfection with both arboviruses and
identified priorities for future research.
Fig. 2 legend. Clinical symptoms typical of dengue (top) and chikungunya infections (bottom). The red line denotes the cumulative distributions
(and 95 % CI at the 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles) for the incubation period of human infection (time between initial infection and symptoms
onset) for both arboviruses as reported in a recent systematic review of Rudolph et al. [58]. Dengue virus infection (top): time course for the three
phases of dengue infection (febrile, critical and recovery phase) are reproduced from WHO [92]. Boxes indicating typical signs/symptoms of
dengue virus infection were reproduced from Whitehead et al. [91] unless otherwise indicated. Arrows indicate that signs/symptoms may occur
earlier/later than illustrated (eg. headaches may occur earlier than 4.5 days post-infection). Notes: 1Onset of the critical phase usually coincides
with defeverescence and is characterised by an increase in capillary permeability and significant plasma leakage lasting 1-2 days. Disease may
resolve without entering the critical phase [93]. 2Mild haemorrhagic manifestations (mucosal bleeding/petechiae/bruising) may be observed from
the febrile phase. Vaginal and intestinal bleeding may occur less commonly [92]. 3Platelet counts decline during the febrile phase (broken line),
reaching lowest values at defeverescence. Thrombocytopenia, however, should not be used as an early indicator for development of severe
disease (dengue haemorrhagic fever) as platelet counts in the early febrile phase do not vary markedly [93]. 4Hypovolemic shock typically lasts
1-2 days and can develop during late stages of the disease [91, 92]. 5During the recovery phase, reabsorption of extravascular compartment fluid
occurs over 2-3 days [92]. Chikungunya virus infection (bottom): time course for the two phases of chikungunya infection (acute and chronic phase)
and typical signs and symptoms are reproduced from Suhrbier et al. [90]. 6Viraemia typically lasts 5-7 days [90] and may precede the onset of
symptoms. Viraemia in symptomatic patients typically peaks within the first three days [94] and has been reported to last for up to 11 days [95].
Viraemia has also been observed to persist in some patients for 2-3 days post- defervescence [95]

 Similar to the global compendium of dengue [71], a
consolidated, easily updateable and continuously main-
tained global database of chikungunya case notifications is
needed and should be linked with reports of vector species
detection. Subsequent to the 2006 chikungunya outbreak
in French territory Le Reunion, several European coun-
tries (among them, France, Italy and Switzerland) have
adopted a linked surveillance system for both arboviruses
and vectors, with clear guidelines for curbing spread in-
cluding educating inhabitants of outbreak foci on personal
protection from mosquito bites, and rapid-response inte-
grated vector management control campaigns [72]. Fol-
lowing France’s example, and, particularly in countries at
the fringes of transmission and that have the facilities,
both arboviruses must be nationally notifiable for this
database to be useful in tracking the spread of disease with
any fidelity. We note that this is easily implemented for
countries that already have national notifiable databases
for other diseases, and that are considered at high risk of
incursion by these pathogens. One such example is
Australia, which lists dengue as nationally notifiable but
not chikungunya in all states and territories.
Improved cartographic refinement to a sub-national
level is a logical next step that would build on the
current exercise. While this was possible for some
countries, data were not available to inform a global,
sub-national level map. Differentiating endemic from
epidemic regions for both chikungunya and dengue,
and introducing an ordinal categorisation of disease
level, such as has been developed for malaria [73],
would enable tracking changes of the burden of disease
and facilitate prioritisation of interventions. Enhanced
geographical refinement and improved categorisation of
at risk areas would not only enable focused targeting of
surveillance and vector control, but also inform the de-
nominator of co-infection prevalence.
In the current study we have identified a wide range of
reported coinfection prevalence estimates (from 1.0–
36.4 %); a key limitation with interpreting this finding is
that it is set against a variable and dynamic background
of monotypic infection prevalence. Furthermore, popula-
tion standardised data is required to estimate the overall
or by region DENV/CHIKV co-infection prevalence [74];
currently, it is not possible to compute a pooled estimate
using the available data provided in the studies. Import-
antly, determining whether infection with one of the ar-
boviruses enhances or attenuates host susceptibility to
heterologous infection is not possible through indirect
inference of relative prevalence levels; and this potential
for ecological fallacy has been discussed fully in the con-
text of more classically recognised mixed infections, for
example the polyparasitism of soil-transmitted helminths
[75]. The limited available information on infectivity of
co-infected individuals provided by the 2012 Gabon
study of Caron and colleagues suggests that co-infection
reduces viral load relative to monotypic infection [30].
Determining how robust this result is across studies is
important both immediately in terms of outbreak and
control threshold estimation and in the longer term in
the
co-evolutionary
context
of
these
co-circulating
pathogens.
Of related epidemiological significance is the deter-
mination of vector competence in virus-infected and
superinfected mosquitoes [76, 77]. A recent review and
modelling analysis by Christofferson et al. (2014) dem-
onstrates the importance of considering the different
combinations of pathogen-vector pairs at a finer reso-
lution than serotype-genotype because of the variation in
transmission potential found in even closely related strains
[78]. Additionally, experiments suggest co-infection with
multiple dengue serotypes may interfere with the vec-
tor’s ability to transmit virus [79]; whereas transmission
enhancement has been demonstrated in the context of
some other arboviruses [80]. Whether the chikungunya
E1-226 V mutant that significantly increases chikun-
gunya infectivity to Ae. albopictus also affects co-
infected mosquitoes in their capacity as dengue vectors
is unclear. Identifying any synergistic or antagonistic
pathogen interactions within the vector constitutes an
important, achievable future milestone in assessing the
epidemiological consequences of chikungunya and den-
gue co-distribution.
The current study emphasises the likelihood of mis-
diagnosis of chikungunya infections among background
dengue transmission (and vice versa). Critically, misdiag-
nosis not only hampers epidemiological understanding
of both diseases but can profoundly affect the clinical
picture of, and outcome for, infected patients. For ex-
ample, misdiagnosis of dengue fever as chikungunya (or
missing a dengue infection when coinciding with chi-
kungunya) risks delaying or disrupting dengue-specific
intensive supportive treatment [81] which can have a
ten-fold impact on likelihood of progression from den-
gue fever to severe disease [82–85]. It also risks inappro-
priate prescription of arthralgia-alleviating nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs (often employed in treating chi-
kungunya patients) which could lead to severe bleeding
in patients with thrombocytopenia or DHF [35]. The
opposite and potentially more likely scenario in which
chikungunya infection is misdiagnosed as dengue (or
missed in a co-infected individual) masks the true geo-
graphical extent of CHIKV and population at risk of in-
fection. It also obscures the likelihood of progression to
severe disease in chikungunya patients: did the in-
creased fatality rate reported post 2004 [11] result from
a mutated CHIKV or was it simply easier to correctly
attribute deaths from dengue-like illness due to in-
creased awareness of chikungunya during the outbreak?

 Conclusions
In this study we provide evidence of widespread co-
distribution and co-infection with dengue and chikun-
gunya. Our results suggest that clear protocols are
urgently needed for realistic and effective control proce-
dures which a) include emergency responses that take
advantage of the shared transmission route of these ar-
boviruses, b) are tempered by local transmission settings
and informed by linked pathogen-vector databases and
c)
capitalise
upon
modern
modelling
methods
for
informing both the biology of infection and transmission
processes as well as the strategy and tactics of disease
control. Quantitative methods have been capitalised
upon to great effect in terms of geospatial statistical ap-
proaches for generating high-resolution global maps of
dengue risk [5]; early warning systems of dengue out-
breaks [86]; biologically detailed multi-serotype mathem-
atical models of dengue spread and control [87, 88];
and combinations thereof [89]. The time is ripe to take
advantage of these developments to accelerate corre-
sponding developments for chikungunya as well as
dengue-chikungunya co-distribution and co-infection,
to facilitate a more holistic understanding of the rapidly
evolving, global epidemiology of these arboviruses.
