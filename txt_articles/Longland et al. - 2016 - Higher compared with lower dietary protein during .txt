ABSTRACT
Background: A dietary protein intake higher than the Recommen-
ded Dietary Allowance during an energy deficit helps to preserve
lean body mass (LBM), particularly when combined with exercise.
Objective: The purpose of this study was to conduct a proof-of-
principle trial to test whether manipulation of dietary protein intake
during a marked energy deficit in addition to intense exercise train-
ing would affect changes in body composition.
Design: We used a single-blind, randomized, parallel-group prospec-
tive trial. During a 4-wk period, we provided hypoenergetic (w40%
reduction compared with requirements) diets providing 33 6 1 kcal/
kg LBM to young men who were randomly assigned (n = 20/group)
to consume either a lower-protein (1.2 g $ kg21 $ d21) control diet
(CON) or a higher-protein (2.4 g $ kg21 $ d21) diet (PRO). All
subjects performed resistance exercise training combined with high-
intensity interval training for 6 d/wk. A 4-compartment model assess-
ment of body composition was made pre- and postintervention.
Results: As a result of the intervention, LBM increased (P , 0.05) in
the PRO group (1.2 6 1.0 kg) and to a greater extent (P , 0.05)
compared with the CON group (0.1 6 1.0 kg). The PRO group had
a greater loss of fat mass than did the CON group (PRO: 24.8 6 1.6 kg;
CON: 23.5 6 1.4kg; P , 0.05). All measures of exercise per-
formance improved similarly in the PRO and CON groups as a result
of the intervention with no effect of protein supplementation. Changes
in serum cortisol during the intervention were associated with changes
in body fat (r = 0.39, P = 0.01) and LBM (r = 20.34, P = 0.03).
Conclusions: Our results showed that, during a marked energy def-
icit, consumption of a diet containing 2.4 g protein $ kg21 $ d21 was
more effective than consumption of a diet containing 1.2 g protein $
kg21 $ d21 in promoting increases in LBM and losses of fat mass
when combined with a high volume of resistance and anaerobic
exercise. Changes in serum cortisol were associated with changes
in body fat and LBM, but did not explain much variance in either
measure.

INTRODUCTION
Hypoenergetic diet–induced weight loss results in w20–30%
of mass lost as lean body mass (LBM),3 with the remaining mass
lost from adipose tissue (1). Retention of LBM during weight
loss may be important in maintaining physical performance while
also preserving skeletal muscle. Strategies that attenuate the loss of
LBM and even allow gains in LBM to occur during an energy deficit
are of interest to athletes and for health in general. Consuming
supplemental protein during resistance training (RT) can result in an
increased accretion of LBM (2). Evidence from Areta et al. (3)
showed that consuming 30 g protein after resistance exercise while in
an energy deficit resulted in a greater stimulation of muscle protein
synthesis (MPS) than did consumption of 15 g protein. Pasiakos et al.
(4) reported that daily protein at twice the Recommended Dietary
Allowance (RDA) for protein attenuated the loss of LBM during an
energy deficit with both aerobic and resistance exercise. Other re-
search suggests that $2 g protein $ kg21 $ d21 may be required to
maintain LBM when an individual is in an energy deficit (5).
RT attenuates the loss of skeletal muscle mass during an energy
deficit presumably by stimulating MPS (3, 4). Combining a higher
protein intake with RT during caloric restriction would act syner-
gistically on the rates of MPS, resulting in a greater ratio of fat to
LBM lost during energy restriction (5, 6), which may be advan-
tageous for physical performance. In addition, high-intensity interval
training (HIT)/sprint interval training (SIT) during a hypoenergetic
period may also aid in promoting LBM retention (7). HIT/SIT also
results in rapid gains in aerobic fitness, as well as endurance ca-
pacity, thus contributing to physical performance outcomes (8, 9).
In subjects who were in energy balance (or mildly positive energy
balance), exercise-induced changes in hormones such as testosterone,

 growth hormone, cortisol, and/or insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I)
were not associated with changes in MPS (10, 11), muscle mass (12,
13), or strength (13). Nonetheless, there is still disagreement on
whether changes in systemic hormones mediate exercise-induced
changes (14). The role of hormones and their association with
body composition under hypoenergetic conditions combined
with high-intensity exercise has been less well studied; however,
when under extreme energy deprivation combined with high
energy expenditure, there have been associations observed
between changes in hormones and body composition (15, 16).
Given the synergistic anabolic properties of RT and dietary
protein, and potentially of HIT/SIT, we evaluated whether
a higher-protein (2.4 g $ kg21 $ d21) diet (PRO) or a lower-
protein (1.2 g $ kg21 $ d21) control diet (CON) during
a marked energy deficit (40% reduction compared with re-
quirements) would attenuate the loss or promote the gain of
LBM while RT and HIT/SIT were performed. We hypothe-
sized that, during an energy deficit of w40% compared with
estimated energy requirements (33 6 1 kcal $ kg21 LBM $ d21)
for 28 d, consumption of the PRO compared with the CON would
allow for better maintenance and possibly augmentation of LBM,
while reducing adipose tissue and enhancing physical function.
METHODS
Research participants
The trial was a single-blind, randomized, parallel prospective
trial conducted between January 2013 and February 2014
(NCT01776359) at McMaster University. The trial protocol was
approved by the Hamilton Integrated Research Ethics Board and
complied with the standards as set out in the Canadian Tri-Council
Policy statement on the use of human participants in research
(http://www.pre.ethics.gc.ca/pdf/eng/tcps2/TCPS_2_FINAL_Web.
pdf). Forty overweight [BMI (in kg/m2) .25] young men (23 6 2 y,
184 6 8 cm, 97.4 6 16 kg) (Table 1) were recruited via posters
and newspaper advertisements from the local Hamilton com-
munity and volunteered to participate in the study after being
informed of the procedures and potential risks involved in the
investigation. All participants were recreationally active (i.e.,
played noncompetitive sports or engaged in some form of
physical activity 1–2 times/wk); however, no participants were
regularly performing resistance exercise nor were they regularly
performing structured progressive aerobic or anaerobic training.
Participants were assessed by medical screening questionnaires at
baseline to exclude those with health conditions that might affect their
response to the study protocol or compromise their safety. Partici-
pants gave informed written consent before the commencement of
the study. Once consent was obtained, participants were randomly
assigned (with the use of the random number generation of a code:
http://www.randomization.com/) by the same investigator (SYO) to
either the CON group, which consumed an energy-restricted diet with
a 40 6 3% reduction in energy intake compared with estimated
requirements (33 6 1 kcal $ kg21 LBM $ d21; 15% protein, 50%
carbohydrates, and 35% fat), with 1.2 g $ kg21 protein $ d21, or the
PRO group, which consumed an energy-restricted diet with a 40 6
3% reduction in energy intake compared with estimated requirements
(33 6 1 kcal $ kg21 LBM $ d21; 35% protein, 50% carbohydrates,
and 15% fat), with 2.4 g $ kg21 protein $ d21. Subject flow through
the protocol is shown in Figure 1. Subjects’ preintervention de-
scriptive characteristics are shown in Table 1.
Experimental protocol
Participants reported to the laboratory and underwent famil-
iarization for all exercises to be performed throughout the study
period. On a separate day, participants underwent a progressive
maximal aerobic capacity test ( _
VO2max) on a cycle ergometer
with the use of a ramp protocol as described previously (17). On
a subsequent day, isometric maximal voluntary contraction of
the knee extensors was completed with the use of a Biodex
dynamometer as described below. Participants also performed
a Wingate Anaerobic Test to determine peak anaerobic power
(further description provided below). On a separate day, par-
ticipants reported to the laboratory to measure voluntary isotonic
strength as a 1-repetition maximum (1RM) for bench press and
leg press with the use of established standard operating pro-
tocols (8, 18), which were strictly controlled and followed each
time participants were tested by a single investigator (TML).
Participants were provided with a 3-d diet for weight main-
tenance (w15–18% protein, 55–60% carbohydrate, and 20–25%
fat) with energy requirements based on the Harris–Benedict
equation, with the use of an activity factor estimated based
on the subject’s self-reported habitual daily activities. On day 3
of the maintenance diet, participants reported to the laboratory
after a 10-h overnight fast for body composition–related mea-
sures described in detail below. A blood sample was also taken
from an antecubital vein (see below for details).
Diet
Participants were provided with all meals and beverages to
consume throughout the intervention period (with the exception
of water and noncaloric drinks, which were ad libitum). Diets
corresponded to an individually constructed energy-restricted
meal plan. Participants were placed on a 3-d rotating diet with
lunchtime and dinnertime meals provided as prepackaged frozen
meals (Copper County Foods). Both groups received beverages
containing whey protein to be consumed throughout the day, with
one beverage being consumed immediately after training in the
presence of the investigators on exercise days. The composition
of the beverages is given in Table 2. Compliance with the nu-
tritional intervention (i.e., consumption of all the provided study
foods) was assessed by daily contact with participants, food
consumption checklists, and daily weight monitoring, and was
estimated to be 93%. Deviations from the diet were recorded
and adjustments were made to the subjects’ diets to ensure
a consistent energy deficit. Compliance with the exercise

 protocol was .96% and did not differ between groups (P = 0.89).
Dietary macronutrient breakdown and energy intake for both
groups during the protocol can be found in Table 3.
Each participant received 3 or 4 dairy-based beverages/d
(depending on their body weight) with ingredients dependent
on their group assignment (Table 2). Specific meals containing
higher or lower protein were consumed so that boluses of protein
were spread out throughout the day. Both drinks were flavored
identically, resulting in no perceptible taste differences in the
drinks (based on a blinded taste test) between groups. Drink
protein content was altered by adding Agropur IsoChill 9010
Instantized Whey Protein Isolate. Maltodextrin was added to each
of the drinks to change their energy content, but also to keep the
protein-to-carbohydrate ratios similar between groups. Blinding
of the subjects to their dietary intervention group was accom-
plished through the subjects’ assigned drinks (Table 2), which
accounted for .90% of the macronutrient differences between
the groups. Given that after study completion subjects guessed
their nutritional assignment at rates no better than chance, we
believe the blinding was reasonable.
Exercise training
Participants reported to the laboratory 6 d/wk for exercise
training that consisted of the following: 1) a full-body resistance
exercise circuit, which was completed 2 times/wk with circuits
(no rest between exercises). Circuits included 10 repetitions/set
for 3 sets at 80% of 1RM, with the last set of each exercise to
volitional failure, with 1 min of rest between sets; 2) HIT/SIT,
which took place 2 times/wk. Sessions consisted of one session
of SIT (progressing from four to eight 30-s Wingate bouts) with
a 4-min rest between bouts (protocol described in detail below),
and a second session of modified HIT consisting of 10 bouts of
an all-out sprint for 1 min at 90% of peak power (watts at
_
VO2max), with 1-min rest intervals pedaling at 50 W; 3) a weekly
250-kJ time trial on a cycle ergometer during which participants
were instructed to complete the trial as quickly as possible while
self-adjusting the ergometer resistance; and 4) a plyometric
body weight circuit with a 30-s rest between exercises.
To prevent sedentary activity at nonexercise times, all par-
ticipants were provided with a hip-worn pedometer (AccuSTEP
400; ACCUSPLIT) and were instructed to accumulate at least
10,000 steps/d throughout the trial. Step counts were monitored
on a daily basis and averaged 11,915 6 2492 steps/d throughout
the intervention, with no differences pre- to postintervention or

 between groups. Subjects who reported .2 consecutive days of
,10,000 steps/d were instructed to complete greater steps in the
ensuing 2–3 d to ensure that their average number of daily steps
was $10,000.
Body composition
Body composition was determined with the use of a 4-
compartment model of body composition as described pre-
viously (19). Total body volume was determined with the use of
air-displacement plethysmography (BodPod; Cosmed), total
body water was determined with the use of bioelectrical im-
pedance (Maltron Bio-Scan MPR 920-II; Maltron International),
and bone mineral content was determined with the use of dual-
energy X-ray absorptiometry (QDR 4500A, software version
12.31; Hologic). Calculations of body fat and LBM were made
with an equation adapted from Lohman and Going (20). These
measures were performed on the same day after a 10-h fast and
were measured at the same time of day before and upon
completion of the 28-d protocol. Subjects wore only light, form-
fitting shorts for all body composition tests. Subjects were
euhydrated (according to urine specific gravity) and abstained
from physical activity for 48 h before their body composition
testing to minimize variability. CVs for repeated measures on
subsequent days were the following: BodPod, 1.2%; bio-
electrical impendance, 1.9%; and dual-energy X-ray absorpti-
ometry, 0.8%.
Strength and muscular performance
Isometric knee extensor torque was measured with the use of
a Biodex dynamometer as described previously (18). Single best
isotonic lift strength (1RM) testing was conducted in the exercise
testing laboratory with the use of free weights and well-defined
standard operating procedures. Participants were familiarized on
a separate day with both the bench press and leg press exercises
a minimum of 4 d before 1RM testing to reduce muscle soreness/
fatigue that may have occurred as a result of the familiarization.
1RM was determined within 4 attempts with rest periods of 3–5 min
between attempts.
Push-up and sit-up tests were conducted while following strict
standard operating procedures. The maximum number of push-
ups performed with correct form consecutively (without rest) was
counted as the subjects’ score (the same evaluator scored all
participants). The sit-up tests were conducted (with the same
evaluator, TML) so that participants performed as many sit-ups
as possible with good form per protocol in 60 s.
Aerobic and anaerobic testing
Participants performed an incremental test to exhaustion on an
electronically braked cycle ergometer (Excalibur Sport V2.0;
Lode) to determine _
VO2max with the use of an online gas col-
lection system (Moxus modular oxygen uptake system; AEI
technologies). On the test day, participants were instructed to
warm up for 10 min on a cycle ergometer at a low resistance
(70 W). Participants then completed the protocol as previously
described (17), with verbal encouragement throughout the test.
The measurement began with the participant cycling at a work-
load of 70 W with wattage increasing at 1 W/s thereafter.
AWingate Anaerobic Test was performed on an electronically
braked cycle ergometer (Wingate Velotron Racemate), as de-
scribed (21), against a resistance equivalent to 0.075 kg/kg body
mass. Peak and mean power were subsequently determined with
the use of an online data acquisition system. During the 4-min
recovery period between tests, subjects remained on the cycle
ergometer and either rested or were permitted to cycle at a low
cadence (50 rpm) against a light resistance (30 W) to reduce
venous pooling in the lower extremities.
A time trial with the use of methods described previously (21)
was completed on a day separate from all other testing before and
weekly during the intervention, as well as after the intervention
was completed. In brief, subjects were instructed to complete
250-kJ self-paced work laboratory time trials on an electronically
braked cycle ergometer (Excalibur Sport V2.0; Lode) as quickly
as possible with no temporal, verbal, or physiologic feedback.
The only feedback provided during the time trials was work
completed, which was presented as “distance covered” (e.g., 250 kJ
was equated to 10 km such that visual feedback at any point
during the time trial was presented in units of distance rather
than work completed).
Blood sampling, hormonal measurements, and urinary
measures
Blood was sampled by venipuncture from subjects after a 10-h
overnight fast before the intervention and 48 h after the last
training session at the end of the intervention. Blood was col-
lected in evacuated tubes and allowed to clot for 15 min at room
temperature before being centrifuged at 48C for 15 min at
1500 3 g. Serum was subsequently removed and stored at
2808C before analysis. Urine collections (24-h) were initiated
after the first morning urinary void and collected into sterile
urine jugs. Urine was stored at 48C during collection and was
returned to the laboratory the morning after the 24 collection
period ended. Urine volume was measured and aliquots of urine
(w1.5 mL each) were placed into tubes for storage at 2208C
before analysis.
All analyses were carried out at the core clinical chemistry
facilities at McMaster University Medical Centre with the use of
the procedures used and described by our group previously (11,
13). In brief, serum samples were analyzed for cortisol, sex
hormone binding globulin, total and free testosterone, growth
hormone, ghrelin, and total and free IGF-I with the use of solid-
phase, 2-site chemiluminescence immunometric assays (Immu-
lite; Intermedico) or a 2-site immunoradiometric assay (Diagnostic
Systems Laboratories). All intra- and interassay CVs for these
hormones were ,8%, with the exception of free testosterone,
which was ,11%. Blood urea nitrogen was measured with the

 use of an automated assay system (Beckman Synchron LX20).
Serum and urinary creatinine were measured with the use of an
automated assay system (HumaStar 600), which is traceable to
isotope dilution mass spectrometry. Intra- and interassay
CVs for these metabolites were all ,5%. Using the serum
and urinary creatinine concentrations, we calculated creati-
nine clearance. Using serum creatinine, we calculated the es-
timated glomerular filtration rate with the use of the Chronic
Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation (22), with
appropriate race- and age-specific adjustments.
Statistical analysis
Sample sizes were determined a priori powered on the
primary outcome of lean mass loss (by dual-energy X-ray
absorptiometry) to detect a differential lean mass loss of 1 kg,
with a = 0.05 and power at 90%, to require 16 subjects/group
at a higher (2.4 g $ kg21 $ d21) and lower (1.2 g $ kg21 $ d21)
protein intake in an equivalent energy deficit as used in the
current protocol (based on pilot data collected in our laboratory).
Data were assessed for normality with the use of a Kolmogorov–
Smirnov test, and any non-normal data (glomerular filtration
rate, testosterone, free testosterone, growth hormone, and cor-
tisol) were corrected with the use of logarithmic transformation
to ensure that kurtosis and skewedness were within normal
bounds. Nonpaired pre- and postintervention data for groups
were compared with the use of an unpaired Student’s t test. All
data were analyzed with the use of a 2-factor repeated measures
ANCOVA with protein intake (between) and time (within) as the
main variables. Covariates included age, height, weight, baseline
body composition (when assessing body composition), and
baseline performance measures (when assessing changes in
performance). Significant interaction effects were analyzed with
the use of Tukey’s post hoc test to determine the location of
pairwise differences within (time) and/or between (diet). Pear-
son’s product-moment correlation coefficients were used to
evaluate the relations between variables. Statistical significance
was set at a # 0.05. Analyses were performed with the use of
SPSS (version 20.0.0). Data are presented as means 6 SDs.
RESULTS
There was substantial weight loss in both groups from pre- to
postintervention, but there were no differences in body weight
loss between groups (P . 0.8) (Figure 2). During the in-
tervention, LBM remained unchanged in the CON group (0.1 6
1.0 kg; P , 0.45); however, LBM increased in the PRO group
(1.2 6 1.0 kg) compared with preintervention, and this increase
was greater (P , 0.05) than in the CON group. Both PRO and
CON groups showed a decrease in fat mass after the intervention
(P , 0.001); however, fat mass losses were greater (P , 0.05) in
the PRO group (24.8 6 1.6 kg) than in the CON group (23.5 6
1.4 kg) (Figure 2). Pre- and postintervention body composition
means are shown in Table 4.
With the exception of isometric knee extension torque,
strength increased in all exercises, as did measures of aerobic and
anaerobic capacity and performance on sit-up and push-up tests
(Table 4). There were no differences between groups for any
performance-based variable.
We observed a significant time-by-condition interaction for
blood urea nitrogen, which increased in the PRO group (P ,
0.05) and remained unchanged in the CON group (Table 5).
Creatinine clearance remained unchanged as a result of the
protocol in both groups (Table 4); however, the estimated glo-
merular filtration rate increased in the PRO group from pre- to
postintervention, but remained unchanged in the CON group
(Table 4).
Hormone and metabolite concentrations measured pre- and
postintervention are shown in Table 5. We observed main effects
for time for all hormones and no between-group differences. We
performed correlational analyses between pre- and post-
intervention hormonal concentrations and body composition
pre- and postintervention, or changes in body composition, and
saw no significant relations (all P . 0.35) between any variables
(data not shown). The correlations between the absolute changes
in hormones, thought to be pertinent in determining body
composition change (15, 16), are shown in Figures 3 and 4, as
are the measured changes in fat mass (Figure 3) and LBM
(Figure 4). As Figures 3 and 4 show, there was no correlation
between changes in the concentration of any hormone other than
cortisol, and changes in body fat or LBM. Pooling the data from
the PRO and CON groups, we noted that the intervention-induced
change in resting overnight-fasting cortisol was significantly
correlated with the change in body fat (r = 0.39, P = 0.01) (Figure
4) and LBM (r = 20.34, P = 0.03) (Figure 5). Despite being
statistically significant, the pooled changes in cortisol could ex-
plain only 16% and 11% of the variance in changes in fat mass
and LBM, respectively.
DISCUSSION
We conducted a controlled feeding study in young overweight
men with a protein intake that was close to habitual (CON), but
still greater than the protein RDA, and at an amount 3 times the
protein RDA (PRO). We included forms of exercise that would
promote rapid gains in fitness and strength, as well as promotion
of lean mass retention; however, we also implemented post-
exercise provision of a predominantly whey protein supplement
to augment lean mass preservation in the face of a marked (40%)
energy deficit. The novel finding of the present study was that
a higher protein–containing (2.4 g $ kg21 $ d21) diet consumed
during a period of marked energy deficit (w40% reduction in
estimated energy requirement) during HIT resulted in an

 increase in LBM. In addition, we observed a greater loss (w1.3 kg)
of fat mass in the PRO group than in the CON group. Although
consumption of higher protein resulted in LBM accretion
(w1.1 kg), it should be noted that LBM was unchanged during
a period of high-intensity exercise training and substantial energy
deficit even when the amount of protein consumed (1.2 g $ kg21 $ d21)
was lower. Despite differences in body composition changes
between groups, and in contrast to our hypotheses, there were
no differential responses in strength, performance, aerobic
fitness, or anaerobic power between groups in response to the
intervention.
Several studies have examined the impact of a higher protein
intake and resistance exercise on retention of LBM during energy
deficit (4–6, 23, 24). Pasiakos et al. (4) reduced the energy intake
of young men by 30% from estimated requirements while they
performed daily low-to-moderate–intensity (40–60% _
VO2max)
treadmill and cycling as well as thrice weekly lower-intensity
resistive-type exercise (3 sets of 15 repetitions). Contrary to our
findings, these authors (4) reported that a higher protein diet
(2.4 g $ kg21 $ d21) still resulted in a loss of 1.2 6 0.3 kg LBM
as a result of the 21-d intervention. These authors (4) included
groups that consumed protein at 3 levels—0.8, 1.6, and 2.4 g $
kg21 $ d21—and reported a substantial retention of LBM for
the 1.6 g $ kg21 $ d21 group, but not with consumption of 2.4 g $
kg21 $ d21 of protein. This finding is somewhat congruent with our
observation that the 1.2 g $ kg21 $ d21 of dietary protein in the
current study resulted in retention of LBM. We propose that the
disparate findings of the previous study (4) and our findings may
be due to the timing of our supplementation and the exercise
intensity, which could be important in increasing or maintaining
LBM while in a severe energy deficit (3). Previously, Mettler
et al. (5) showed that during a 2-wk study, neither 1.0 nor 2.3 g $
kg21 $ d21 protein were sufficient to prevent LBM loss during
a period of energy restriction similar to that which we used. We
are unable to ascertain exactly why our data are different from
those of the previous study (5); however, some possibilities in-
clude the fact that our intervention was longer (4 compared with
2 wk), our subjects received controlled diets, our subjects un-
derwent individually supervised exercise sessions, and we used
a 4-compartment model of body composition (considered to be
of greater validity than simply dual-energy X-ray absorptiom-
etry data) and had timed (postexercise) ingestion of protein
drinks. It is also worth noting that our training program involved
intense high-volume resistance exercise and HIT/SIT, which has
not, to our knowledge, been studied in such a severe energy
deficit previously.
In the current study, the loss of fat mass was the sole con-
tributor to the participants’ weight loss. Data from Trapp et al.
(25) suggest that lipolysis increases over 20 min of HIT training
gradually with each session. This research suggests that the
high-intensity exercise our current participants were subjected to
likely enhanced their capacity for fat oxidation and may have
induced an increase in muscle mitochondrial enzyme activity
(25). Evidence from the current trial suggests that high-quality
weight loss (i.e., weight loss with a high fat:LBM ratio), is at-
tainable during marked energy restriction with a higher intake of

 dietary protein in overweight young men. We have previously
reported a similar pattern of body composition change during
a
longer-duration
intervention
in
overweight/obese
pre-
menopausal women (6). We propose that the lean mass–enhancing
effect is one mediated by protein, as meta-analyses have shown
(26, 27). In these same analyses, the authors noted an effect of
protein in mediating a greater loss of fat mass (26, 27); how-
ever, in these studies, as in our study, the impact of changing
other macronutrients needs to be recognized. We chose to
lower fat intake in the PRO group and match carbohydrate
intake between groups, knowing the impact that carbohydrate
has on exercise performance (28). Thus, we acknowledge that
a strict ascription of the phenotypic changes we observed to
differential protein content of the diet per se is in light of the
differing fat intake between the PRO and CON groups.
Nonetheless, we are unaware of data that would suggest that
a greater or lesser fat intake, at least of the magnitude seen here,
would promote differential lean mass retention and/or differ-
ential fat loss when the energy deficit is identical.
Our data suggest that during a substantial energy deficit, higher
protein consumption (2.4 g $ kg21 $ d21) resulted in an in-
creased stimulation of MPS and/or a suppression of proteolysis
to a greater extent than consumption of 1.2 g $ kg21 $ d21, as
evidenced by gains in LBM in the PRO group. Current evidence
suggests that the energy deficit likely reduces basal MPS (29)
and may also have reduced the sensitivity of MPS to feeding
(30, 31). Nonetheless, recent data have shown that lower rates of
MPS can also be restored by a higher dietary protein intake (3),
particularly so with whey protein (30), which was the supple-
mental protein source used herein. Data from our laboratory
have shown that w0.25 g protein $ kg21 per meal (or 0.4 g
protein $ kg21 per meal as a safe intake amount) maximally
stimulates MPS in young men when participants are in energy
balance (32); however, it has not yet been established what
protein dose would maximally stimulate MPS while in a period
of energy deficit. The data from Areta et al. (3) do show that,
while in an energy deficit, larger protein doses .0.25 g $ kg21
per meal continued to stimulate MPS after resistance exer-
cise. In the current study, participants in the PRO group
regularly consumed w49 g protein/meal (w0.48 g $ kg21 per
meal), resulting in repeated periods of maximally stimulated
MPS compared with the CON group, which consumed w22 g
protein per meal (w0.23 g $ kg21 per meal). Importantly, the

 CON group also consumed enough protein combined with an-
abolic exercise throughout the intervention to retain muscle
mass. We hypothesize, given our data, that protein dose per
meal, protein quality, and timing of consumption relative to
exercise would become more important in determining changes
in LBM when in a caloric deficit because of decreases in basal
rates of MPS and a reduced sensitivity of MPS to protein
feeding (29–31).
Resting, overnight-fasting hormonal concentrations were
made before and after the intervention (Table 5). We did not
observe any interaction effects between conditions, but did ob-
serve main effects over time for all hormones (Table 5). In
addition, we did not observe any independent correlations with
hormones or any body composition or performance variables
(data not shown). Our hormonal data align roughly with previous
work in military personnel undergoing high levels of daily ac-
tivity in an extreme energy deficit (15, 16). In the study described
in these publications (15, 16), the degree of energy deficit was
greater and protein intake was much lower than in the present
study. These authors did not observe that increasing protein from
0.5 to 0.9 g $ kg21 $ d21 aided in the retention of LBM (15, 16);
however, we speculate that these levels of protein intake would
not be adequate to spare LBM in such a severe energy deficit
(33), so the lack of a protein-sparing effect (15, 16) is not
surprising. We observed that 1.2 g $ kg21 $ d21 ablated the
usual decline in LBM seen during an energy deficit (1), and that
2.4 g $ kg21 $ d21 allowed for an increase in LBM to occur. It
is more than likely, however, that our results were due as much,
if not more, to the addition of resistance exercise, which acts
synergistically to stimulate MPS even in an energy deficit (3).
The percentage change in free IGF-I was, in the previous work
(16), shown to be correlated with the percentage change in fat
mass; however, our results did not show a similar correlation
(Figure 4). The only hormonal change we observed that was
related to changes in body composition was the change in
cortisol (Figures 4 and 5). In general, cortisol opposes fat loss
and promotes loss of LBM during energy restriction (34),
which is what we observed.
A potential limitation of the present trial is the free-living
nature of the protocol. We did provide all food and beverages to
the subjects and asked them to consume everything we provided
and report any deviation from their prescribed diet. As an ob-
jective measure of compliance with the PRO diet, we measured
serum urea and noted that it increased during the intervention and
remained unchanged in the CON group. We had good compliance
with exercise intervention and propose that subjects exerted high
degrees of effort when requested. Because of the nature of the
trial, it was impractical to maintain a double-blinded scheme, and
yet we do not think this influenced the outcomes, because all
analyses were done in a blinded manner and data were only
unblinded after all analyses were complete. We opted in this trial
to keep carbohydrate intake constant between the groups, given
the crucial role that fuel plays in performance (28); thus, fat
content (Table 2), in addition to protein, was different between
the groups. Hence, given that there were differences in fat
content, it cannot be stated conclusively that it was protein that
was responsible for the effects we report here. However, in
conducting a thorough search for manipulations in dietary fat
content to the degree to which we changed it in our protocol, we
could find nothing that would suggest that differing fat content
would affect changes in LBM or fat mass. Thus, we propose that
the effects were predominantly a protein-mediated effect.
In summary, the present study provides evidence that, in young
men, consuming a higher protein diet (2.4 g $ kg21 $ d21) during
energy deficit (w40% reduction in energy intake compared with
requirements) while performing intense resistance exercise training
and HIT can augment LBM over a 28-d period. Furthermore, these
high-intensity exercises performed during a period of energy
deficit have the ability to preserve LBM despite a lower protein
intake (1.2 g $ kg21 $ d21). In conclusion, the current study
provides direct evidence that a higher protein diet during substantial
energy deficit and HIT not only preserves, but increases, LBM and
