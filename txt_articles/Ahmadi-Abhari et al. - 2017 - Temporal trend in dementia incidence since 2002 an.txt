Abstract
Objective To forecast dementia prevalence with a dynamic modelling
approach that integrates calendar trends in dementia incidence with
those for mortality and cardiovascular disease.
Design Modelling study.
Setting General adult population of England and Wales.
Participants The English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) is a
representative panel study with six waves of data across 2002-13. Men
and women aged 50 or more years, selected randomly, and their
cohabiting partners were recruited to the first wave of ELSA (2002-03).
11392 adults participated (response rate 67%). To maintain
representativeness, refreshment participants were recruited to the study
at subsequent waves. The total analytical sample constituted 17 906
people. Constant objective criteria based on cognitive and functional
impairment were used to ascertain dementia cases at each wave.
Main outcome measures To estimate calendar trends in dementia
incidence, correcting for bias due to loss to follow-up of study participants,
a joint model of longitudinal and time-to-event data was fitted to ELSA
data. To forecast future dementia prevalence, the probabilistic Markov
model IMPACT-BAM (IMPACT-Better Ageing Model) was developed.
IMPACT-BAM models transitions of the population aged 35 or more
years through states of cardiovascular disease, cognitive and functional
impairment, and dementia, to death. It enables prediction of dementia
prevalence while accounting for the growing pool of susceptible people
as a result of increased life expectancy and the competing effects due
to changes in mortality, and incidence of cardiovascular disease.
Results In ELSA, dementia incidence was estimated at 14.3 per 1000
person years in men and 17.0/1000 person years in women aged 50 or
more in 2010. Dementia incidence declined at a relative rate of 2.7%
(95% confidence interval 2.4% to 2.9%) for each year during 2002-13.
Using IMPACT-BAM, we estimated there were approximately 767 000
(95% uncertainty interval 735 000 to 797 000) people with dementia in
England and Wales in 2016. Despite the decrease in incidence and age
specific prevalence, the number of people with dementia is projected to
increase to 872 000, 1 092 000, and 1 205 000 in 2020, 2030, and 2040,
respectively. A sensitivity analysis without the incidence decline gave a
much larger projected growth, of more than 1.9 million people with
dementia in 2040.
Conclusions Age specific dementia incidence is declining. The number
of people with dementia in England and Wales is likely to increase by
57% from 2016 to 2040. This increase is mainly driven by improved life
expectancy.
Introduction
It has been predicted that by 2050 well in excess of 100 million
people worldwide will have dementia.1 Current costs of dementia
to the UK economy are estimated at £23bn ($29bn; €26bn)
annually.2 Burden of disability and years of life lost due to

 dementia in the UK increased by 76% between 1990 and 2010.3
Accurate projections for burden of dementia is a key step for
planning to meet future needs.
Projections of dementia burden based on constant prevalence
or incidence rates may not be precise,4-6 as they will only reflect
population aging. Accurate predictions rely on accounting for
changes in dementia incidence as well as changes in mortality
rates. The competing effect of cardiovascular risk on future
projections of dementia is also important. Alzheimer’s disease,
vascular dementia, and cardiovascular disease share risk
factors.7 8 Thus, vascular risk reduction is likely to drive down
age specific dementia incidence while, in contrast, leading to
increased life expectancy and larger numbers susceptible to
dementia.9 Given the opposing effects, simultaneous modelling
of cardiovascular disease, dementia, and mortality is likely to
enhance the accuracy of projections. Addressing shared
determinants of disease follow recommendations from the
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence,10 Public
Health England, and the World Health Organization in the
Blackfriars consensus.11 Such modelling approaches are,
however, currently lacking.4
A key determinant of the future burden of dementia will be the
underlying incidence trend. Although the balance of evidence
suggests dementia incidence is declining,12-18 the magnitude of
the decline is less certain. The ideal approach to determine time
trends in dementia incidence would be based on continuous
monitoring of a defined and representative population using a
standard approach for case identification.13-20 In large
epidemiological studies, changes in clinical criteria21 22 and poor
diagnostic agreement among clinicians23 are sources of variation
in measured dementia incidence over time. Another challenge
in establishing time trends is higher dropout among cohort study
participants affected by, or in the preclinical stages of,
dementia,24 25 which leads to inaccurate estimates of dementia
incidence and calendar trends.
In the present study, we developed a novel probabilistic Markov
method (IMPACT-Better Ageing Model) to simultaneously
model the transitions of the population through states of health,
cardiovascular disease, cognitive and functional impairment,
and dementia, to death, to obtain projections for the prevalence
of dementia in England and Wales up to 2040. To account for
the effect of selective dropout of study participants and to obtain
unbiased estimates for dementia incidence over the past 15
years, with which to inform the model, we applied a robust joint
modelling technique26 to data from the English Longitudinal
Study of Ageing.
Methods
Study population and sample
The English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) sample was
recruited in 2002-03 from participants of the 1998-2001 health
surveys for England.27 28 The sample was drawn by postcode
sector, stratified by health authority and proportion of
households in non-manual socioeconomic groups. A total of 12
099 men and women participated (response rate 67%), including
11 392 people aged 50 or more selected through the random
sampling and 707 cohabiting partners. Survey weights were
applied to ensure study participants formed a representative
sample. Comparison of sociodemographic characteristics against
national census indicated the ELSA sample was broadly
representative of the population of England.27 To maintain
representativeness of the study sample, refreshment participants
were recruited to the study at wave 3 (2006-07; ages 50-55),
wave 4 (2008-09; ages 50-74), and wave 6 (2012-13; ages
50-55) all drawn from the health surveys of England for the
preceding years. A total of 17 906 participants were recruited
to the study between waves 1 and 6 (see supplementary figure
1). Wave 7 data (2014-15) was not included in the analysis other
than to identify transient impairments in cognition or function.
At each wave, participants were interviewed to collect extensive
demographic, medical, and lifestyle data. Clinical examinations
were conducted at waves 2, 4, and 6. Participants provided
written informed consent.
Assessment of cognitive function in ELSA
Three sets of cognitive function tests were administered at every
wave of ELSA. These tests, and method of being administered,
include orientation to time, day, month, and year; immediate
and delayed memory: one noun from a list of 10 is presented
every two seconds to the participant who is then asked to recall
as many words as possible immediately and after a short delay;
and verbal fluency: participants are asked to name as many
animals as possible in one minute. At waves 1, 4, and 6 a test
of numeracy function was carried out by asking participants to
solve four simple mathematics problems. At wave 6 an
additional test of literacy was carried out by asking participants
to deduce from a medicine label the number of days the
medicine should be taken. Orientation to time was used to assess
concentration, scores on the immediate and delayed recall were
used as a measure of memory function, and scores on the animal
naming, literacy, and numeracy test were used to measure verbal
fluency and executive function.
The short version of the informant questionnaire for cognitive
decline (IQCODE) was administered for participants unable to
take part in the study who provided consent in advance or
through a consultee.29 The IQCODE comprises 16 questions
asking a proxy informant (usually an immediate family member)
how the participant’s state of memory, ability to learn new tasks,
judgment, and handling of key everyday situations (eg, making
decisions on every day matters, or handling money for shopping)
are compared with two years ago. The answers are graded on
5 point scales, from much improved to much worse. Use of the
IQCODE questionnaire to identify cognitive impairment has
been previously validated.29 The participant or proxy informants
were asked about any doctor diagnosis of dementia.
Assessment of functional impairment
Participants or proxy informants were asked about the ability
of the participant to independently conduct basic activities of
daily living. Such activities are key tasks related to self care and
consist of getting in or out of bed, walking across a room,
bathing or showering, using the toilet, dressing, cutting food,
and eating. Impairment in independently performing one or
more activities of daily living was defined as functional
impairment. We considered impairment in conducting activities
of daily living reported once, where the participant fully
recovered at all further waves of data collection, to be transient
and did not categorise those as functional impairment. Transient
impairments at wave 6 were identified using wave 7 data.
Case definition of cognitive impairment and
dementia
We used an operational criteria based on cognitive function
tests and IQCODE to define cognitive impairment.
Cognitive function tests—we used the criteria adapted for
cognitive impairment no dementia (CIND).19 30 Cognitive
impairment was defined as impairment in two or more domains
of cognitive function. Impairment in each domain of cognitive

 function is defined as a score of 1.5 standard deviations below
the mean or lower compared with the population aged 50-80
years with the same level of education. Education was
categorised in three levels: no qualification; O-level, A-level,
or equivalent; and higher (university) education. We did not
find considerable differences between men and women in the
distribution of cognitive function scores after adjustment for
age and education. We did not find evidence of large learning
effects in consecutive cognitive function tests. The annual age
specific and sex specific decline observed among participants
who conducted the tests four or more years apart was similar
to participants who conducted the tests two years apart. The
cognitive assessment was considered invalid if the participant
had responded to fewer than three tests on the cognitive battery.
To avoid the effect of transient cognitive decline, resulting from
delirium or other mental disorders, if the participant improved
by 1 SD or more on cognitive tests at the consecutive wave,
they were considered to not have cognitive impairment.
Transient impairments of cognition at wave 6 were identified
through cognitive assessment at wave 7.
IQCODE—a cut point of 3.3-3.6 is used for identification of
cognitive impairment based on the IQCODE.29 We used a
conservative cut-point of 3.6 for specificity.
Dementia caseness was defined either as a combination of
cognitive impairment (according to the previously described
definitions) and functional impairment (difficulty in performing
one or more activities of daily living), or self reported doctor
diagnosis of dementia. The operational definition adapted in
this study conforms to criteria from the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition, for
diagnosis of dementia (see supplementary file, section 1, for
explanation).
Cardiovascular disease and mortality
Cardiovascular disease in ELSA was ascertained by self reported
doctor diagnosis of myocardial infarction, stroke, angina,
coronary artery bypass grafting, or death from cardiovascular
causes. Incidence of cardiovascular disease was defined as a
first ever record of disease or intervention for each participant.
Date and cause of death for ELSA study participants are
obtained by data linkage with the UK Office for National
Statistics.
Statistical analysis
Trends in dementia incidence
We estimated the calendar trend in age specific dementia
incidence across 2002-13 in ELSA in three statistical models
with increasing complexity. Firstly, we estimated the calendar
trend by fitting a Cox proportional hazards regression with
incident dementia as the outcome and terms for age, age squared,
sex, interactions of age and sex, and calendar time. Date of
dementia was the mid-point between the wave in which
dementia was reported or ascertained and the latest previous
assessment. For participants who would only be classified as
having dementia if they had impairment in numeracy function
(assessed at waves 1, 4, and 6), the date of ascertainment was
the mid-point between the two consecutive assessments that
included the numeracy function test. The Cox proportional
hazards analysis does not correct for bias as a result of selective
dropout or the competing effect of mortality.
In the second stage, we fitted a competing risks model31 32 with
incident dementia as the outcome and mortality as a competing
risk. Unlike a Cox proportional hazards model, in competing
risks analysis, participants who die are not censored
uninformatively and the effect of change in mortality over time
on calendar trends in dementia incidence is accounted for.
At the third stage, to account for non-random dropout as well
as competing risks of mortality, we fitted a joint model of
longitudinal and time to event data.26 The longitudinal outcome
of the joint model was the average standardised cognitive
function test score, and the survival outcome was incident
dementia. The survival outcome (incident dementia) was
dependent on both the current value and the slope of the
trajectory of the longitudinal outcome (standardised score on
cognitive function tests). Other independent covariates in the
model were age at entry, age squared, time since entry in the
study (representing the effect of aging), time squared, sex,
calendar year, level of education, and midlife history of obesity,
hypertension, and diabetes. The longitudinal component allowed
random intercepts and random slopes for the effect of age at
entry and time since entry to the study. From the joint model
we obtained individual level predictions for probability of
dementia for ELSA study participants who were alive, including
those lost to follow-up. To obtain calendar trends in incidence
of dementia, we fitted linear regression models with log odds
of incident dementia as the outcome to the data with terms for
sex, age, age squared, interaction of sex with age and with age
squared, and calendar time. The validity of this method to obtain
predictions of incident dementia was assessed by comparing
joint model predictions for future waves with data driven
observed incidence rates. We validated the dementia case
definition by comparing age specific incidence rates with those
obtained from the Cognitive Function and Ageing Study-II.13
We examined the effect of changes in potential vascular and
lifestyle risk factors on calendar trends in dementia incidence
by entering risk factors as time varying covariates in regression
models, with log odds of dementia as the outcome. The method
for assessment of risk factors is shown in section 1 of the
supplementary material.
Trends in dementia prevalence—IMPACT-BAM
To obtain valid projections for dementia prevalence to 2040,
we developed IMPACT-BAM (fig 1⇓), a probabilistic discrete
time Markov model. IMPACT-BAM models transitions of the
England and Wales population aged 35 or more years through
states of illness and mortality. The model is initially populated
using age-sex specific prevalence estimates, with transition
probabilities applied at each one year iteration to predict number
of deaths and prevalence of each of the eight states of
IMPACT-BAM at the next calendar year. The model predicts
future prevalence of cardiovascular disease, dementia, and
functional impairment in addition to life expectancy, disabled
and disability-free life expectancy, and mortality.
Input data to inform IMPACT-BAM include the population
structure, the age-sex specific initial prevalence of each health
state in the model, and age-sex-calendar time specific transition
probabilities between states.
We obtained the numbers of the population in England and
Wales in each stratum of age and sex at year 2006 (the start of
the IMPACT-BAM model iterations) from ONS. Numbers of
men and women who reach age 35 and enter the model at each
calendar year are also obtained from ONS predictions. The
entering cohort of 35 year olds is assumed to be free of
cardiovascular disease and cognitive and functional impairment.
The baseline age and sex specific prevalence of each health
state of the model was calculated using six waves of ELSA data
pooled together and attributed to mid-point of the data collection
timeframe, in 2006. The values obtained from this method

 corresponded to values observed at wave three (2006-08; see
supplementary figure 2). We then used the curve fitting tool in
MATLAB to obtain data for single year of age, starting at age
35 years.
The age-sex specific probability of transition from statei to statej
in IMPACT-BAM (transition probability (TPij)) for 2006 was
obtained by fitting a logistic regression model on ELSA data
with statej as outcome and terms for age, sex, interaction of age
and sex, and a variable defining the initial state (statei).
Transition probabilities to CIND (states 3 and 4 in figure 1⇓)
additionally included terms for age squared and its interaction
with sex. We pooled transitions from wave n to wave n+1 in
ELSA so that each individual contributed as many observations
as corresponded to the number of two year epochs in which they
participated in the study until being censored. We used a logistic
model rather than a Cox proportional hazards model because
the two years between data collection waves were relatively
constant between participants and over time, and, unlike hazard
ratios, odds ratios can be transformed into transition
probabilities. Margins of the model provide two year transition
probabilities for each stratum of sex, and single year of age at
2006. The two year probability (P) was then translated into one
year transition probability using the formula:
TP=1−exp((ln(1−P))/2)
All transition probabilities entered in IMPACT-BAM are
calendar time specific. We calculated probabilities of
cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular mortality up to 2040 in
five year age bands using the Bayesian Age Period Cohort
(BAPC) model with ONS mortality and population estimates
from 1982-2012 for England and Wales as inputs (see
supplementary figure 3).33 Mortality rates from each health state
were assumed to change in parallel with overall cardiovascular
and non-cardiovascular mortality rates. We calculated health
state specific transition probabilities to cardiovascular and
non-cardiovascular mortality by estimating the odds ratios of
death from each health state using ELSA data (see
supplementary table 1) and using the odds ratios to obtain the
probability of deaths from cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular
causes from each health state compared with that in the general
population. To obtain state specific cardiovascular and
non-cardiovascular mortality rates we applied the probability
ratios to overall cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular mortality
rates shown in supplementary figure 3. The decline in
cardiovascular incidence paralleled the decline in cardiovascular
mortality in ELSA (see supplementary figure 4). Hence we used
the annual percentage change in cardiovascular mortality to
estimate temporal change in cardiovascular incidence. The
calendar trend for cognitive impairment or dementia was
obtained from the joint model previously described. The effect
of calendar time was imposed on the transition probabilities for
2006 to obtain transition probabilities for future years.
The IMPACT-BAM model was implemented in R statistical
software and a package specifically written for it by author PB.
Stata-14 (StataCorp 2015. College Station, TX: StataCorp LP)
was used for data management and regression analysis to derive
model inputs. The R package “JM” was used for joint modelling
of longitudinal and time to event data.
Assumptions and sensitivity analysis
Table 1⇓ presents the underlying assumptions for
IMPACT-BAM and the evidence supporting the assumptions.
We conducted sensitivity analyses to address uncertainties in
these assumptions. We considered four alternative scenarios for
calendar trend in dementia incidence: calendar trend obtained
from analysis on ELSA data; a 2% relative annual decline as
inferred by the Framingham Heart Study18; a 1.1% relative
annual decline as inferred by Cognitive Function and Ageing
Study-I and Cognitive Function and Ageing Study-II13; and no
calendar decline in dementia incidence. We conducted a
sensitivity analysis assuming the incidence of cardiovascular
disease will no longer decline and will remain stable after 2014.
To explore the impact of parameter uncertainty on model
outputs, we conducted a probabilistic sensitivity analysis using
Monte Carlo simulation. The procedure entails sampling from
specified distributions for the input parameters that were used
in the model for each data cycle. We calculated 1000 iterations
to estimate 95% uncertainty intervals for output variables.
Validation
To validate methods, definitions, and assumptions, we ran the
model starting in 2006 to predict prevalence of dementia in
2011. We compared model estimates with the prevalence of
dementia observed from the Cognitive Function and Ageing
Study-II.20 Similarly, we compared the prevalence of
cardiovascular disease with the health survey for England 2011,34
and mortality rates with data from the ONS. We also compared
model predictions with dementia prevalence at wave 7 of ELSA.
Patient involvement
Study participants were not involved in setting the research
question or the outcome measures, nor were they involved in
developing plans for design or implementation of the study. No
participants were asked to advise on interpretation or writing
up of results. There are no direct plans to disseminate the results
of the research to study participants.
Results
Trends in dementia incidence: ELSA (2002-13)
Supplementary table 2 shows the baseline characteristics of
ELSA participants. Between 2002 and 2013 dementia was
ascertained for a total of 1448 ELSA participants: 634
participants had dementia at the time of recruitment, and 814
incident cases were identified over the course of follow-up;
16.5% occurred in participants aged less than 65 years. Of the
1448 participants with dementia, 466 received a doctor diagnosis
of dementia, 245 were identified through IQCODE questionnaire
plus functional impairment in activities of daily living, and 1078
were identified by impairment in cognitive tests and impairment
in one or more activities of daily living. Of the 245 participants
with dementia based on IQCODE and functional impairment,
171 (70%) reported a doctor diagnosis of dementia. Among
those with impairment in cognitive tests and activities of daily
living function, 263 (25%) reported a doctor diagnosis of
dementia at later stages or were considered to have dementia
based on the IQCODE questionnaire.
Supplementary table 3 shows the number of incident dementia
cases ascertained at each wave of data collection. Age-sex
specific dementia incidence observed in ELSA was consistent
with that observed in the independent Cognitive Function and
Ageing Study-II study, whereas incidence rates corrected for
the effect of dropout were higher (see supplementary figure 5).
Incidence rates of dementia corrected for the effect of dropout
were higher at older ages, marginally higher in women than
men (see supplementary figures 6 and 7.A), and higher than
uncorrected crude observed rates (see supplementary figure
7.B). In 2015, age standardised incidence of dementia in the
population of England and Wales aged 50 or more years was

 estimated at 1.3% in men and 1.5% in women, corresponding
to 125 800 new cases of dementia in men and 162 650 new
cases in women.
The magnitude of the calendar trend in age specific dementia
incidence, without correcting for either mortality or selective
dropout, was obtained from Cox proportional hazards analysis
based on participants who attended and remained in the study
at each two year interval. The age adjusted and sex adjusted
dementia incidence relatively decreased by 1.5% each year
(hazard ratio 0.985, 95% confidence interval 0.954 to 1.018;
see supplementary figure 8.A). Accounting for the competing
risk of mortality in separate competing risks analysis yielded a
steeper trend of −2.7% (0.973, 0.932 to 1.016). The effect of
non-random dropout as well as changing mortality rates was
accounted for by fitting joint models of longitudinal and
time-to-event data. The corrected calendar trend in dementia
incidence was a statistically significant relative reduction of
2.7% each year (odds ratio 0.973, 95% confidence interval 0.971
to 0.976; see supplementary figures 6 and 8.B). The relative
annual reduction tended to be steeper in women (0.972, 0.968
to 0.976) than in men (0.975, 0.971 to 0.980), but the interaction
by sex was not statistically significant. Changes over time in
available risk factors accounted for about 25% of the calendar
effect in dementia incidence (fully adjusted odds ratio 0.98 (95%
confidence interval 0.977 to 0.982); see supplementary table
4).
Trends in dementia prevalence: IMPACT-BAM
Age-sex specific prevalence of dementia at each data collection
wave of ELSA provides the starting values for the
IMPACT-BAM model (see supplementary table 5). In ELSA,
age-sex standardised prevalence of dementia declined over time
(see supplementary figure 9). For the purpose of validating the
model, IMPACT-BAM was populated with age-sex specific
prevalence estimates and transition probabilities for 2006 to
estimate prevalence of dementia, cardiovascular disease, and
mortality in 2011. The age-sex specific dementia prevalences
predicted by IMPACT-BAM for 2011 (see supplementary figure
10) were compatible with estimates from the independent
Cognitive Function and Ageing Study-II. Model predictions
also matched prevalence of dementia at wave 7 of ELSA (see
supplementary figure 11). Cardiovascular disease prevalence
and mortality rates were compatible with observations from
independent sources (see supplementary figures 12 and 13).
In the analyses on future prevalence of dementia up to 2040
assuming a 2.7% relative annual decline in dementia incidence,
the number of people with dementia in England and Wales is
set to increase from 766 600 (95% uncertainty interval 735 200
to 796 900) in 2016 to 871 700 (835 600 to 906 600) in 2020,
1 091 600 (1 034 200 to 1 146 200) in 2030, and 1 204 500 (1
101 000 to 1 296 200) in 2040 (fig 2⇓). Much of the increase
in number of people with dementia occurs in the older age
groups (fig 3⇓, see supplementary figure 14). Overall crude
prevalence of dementia in the population aged 50 or more is
estimated at 3.5% (95% uncertainty interval 3.4% to 3.7%) in
2016, 3.8% (3.7% to 4.0%) in 2020, 4.3% (4.1% to 4.5%) in
2030, and 4.4% (4.0% to 4.7%) in 2040 (fig 4⇓). The crude
prevalence of dementia in population aged 50 or more and 65
or more is estimated to increase up to 2040 in men, whereas in
women it declines after 2025 (fig 4⇓). These crude prevalence
estimates are affected by the population structure. The
prevalence of dementia age standardised to the population of
2015 is estimated to decline by about 21% from 2016 to 2040
(fig 5⇓).
Figure 6⇓ shows the results of sensitivity analyses for predicted
numbers of dementia cases based on different values for calendar
trend in dementia incidence. Assuming no calendar trend in
dementia incidence, the number of people with dementia is
estimated at 1.9 million (95% uncertainty interval 1.76 million
to 2.0 million) in 2040, with an increase rather than a decrease
in age standardised prevalence of dementia (see supplementary
figure 15). The predicted number of people with dementia under
the assumption that cardiovascular disease incidence does not
decline any further was 758 700 (95% uncertainty interval 728
200 to 788 000) in 2016 and 1 112 700 (1 023 400 to 1 192 700)
in 2040 (see supplementary figure 16), 8% fewer compared with
the scenario in which the incidence of cardiovascular disease
continues to decline.
Discussion
Our results shift the balance of evidence towards more certainty
that dementia incidence is indeed decreasing. The decline,
estimated at a relative reduction of 2.7% each year, was evident
after accounting for mortality and non-random dropout from
the study. Although age specific incidence of dementia is
declining, the overall disease burden is set to increase
substantially owing to increased life expectancy and declining
rates of mortality and cardiovascular disease incidence. With
current population projections, we estimate there will be a 57%
increase in the number of people with dementia between 2016
and 2040, with more than 1.2 million people with dementia in
England and Wales by 2040.
Strengths and limitations of this study
To our knowledge, this is the first study to predict number of
cases and prevalence of dementia in a population using methods
that simultaneously model the observed trends in mortality,
cardiovascular disease, and dementia. Previous predictions were
based on constant age specific incidence6 or prevalence2 of
dementia. An accurate projection of the number of people with
dementia is only possible with a modelling strategy that accounts
for the opposing effects of increasing life expectancy and
declining dementia incidence, a requirement highlighted by the
non-linearity of the generated estimates of prevalence in the
present study. On the basis of the calendar effect derived from
the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA), there is an
upward trend in numbers of people with dementia, but to a
smaller degree than previously estimated. Previous forecasts of
larger increases in dementia burden are based on less complex
approaches that do not account for changes in dementia
incidence, survival, or competing risks.4-37 Under the scenario
of assuming that the incidence of dementia does not decline,
prevalence projections for dementia were higher, and were
similar to those of Alzheimer’s Society UK.2
Changes in mortality rates are important determinants of the
numbers of people with dementia as they govern both life
expectancy and the pool of individuals susceptible to dementia,
as well as survival in those affected by the condition,5 and thus
are meticulously incorporated in the model. Cardiovascular and
non-cardiovascular mortality rates have shown steady and linear
downward trends in the past decades, and we assumed this trend
is likely to continue. IMPACT-BAM shows that the decline in
age standardised dementia prevalence, corresponding to the
decline in incidence, is outweighed by population aging in the
near future, and numbers of people with dementia are likely to
increase rapidly between 2015 and 2030. In the following
decade, however, the number of people with dementia will level
out. Furthermore, the numbers of men and women with dementia

 is set to converge within the next 15 years. This finding can
partly be explained by a faster decline in mortality rates in men
compared with women (see supplementary figure 3) and
narrowing of the life expectancy gap between the sexes.9
We derived the required inputs for IMPACT-BAM from best
available data. ELSA is a large, representative sample of the
population aged 50 years or more and surveyed using standard
questions at two year intervals. Six waves of data allowed us
to account for mortality and dropout from the study using robust
statistical methods. Cognitive decline starts at a younger age38
than the 65 or more or 70 or more age groups recruited in
previous studies.12-41 We attempted to fill the gap by capturing
cognitive impairment and dementia starting at age 50. Model
outputs were validated against observations from independent
sources.
ELSA participants were not clinically screened for dementia,
rather, an operational case definition based on standardised
assessments of cognition and function was applied. The
standardised assessment is comparable across time, and thus
more informative of dementia trends than clinical assessments,
which are likely to be affected by changes in diagnostic
criteria21 22 and clinical practice over time.23 The case definition
applied in this study, follows DSM-IV and other clinical criteria
(National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke and
the Association Internationale pour la Recherche et
l’Enseignement en Neurosciences (NINDS-AIREN) and
National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders
and Stroke and the Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Disorders
Association (NINCDS-ADRDA)) in that it hinges on
non-transient impairment in two or more cognitive domains,
resulting in functional impairment (see supplementary file,
section 1). Cognitive assessment in ELSA is based on a set of
standard and validated30-45 cognitive function tests; none the less
the list is not comprehensive. Cognitive impairment in domains
other than those tested may have been missed, leading to
underestimation of dementia cases. Similarity of age specific
estimates of dementia incidence and prevalence with those of
CFAS-II suggests this source of bias is small.
The case definition for dementia used in this study required
moderate to severe impairments in cognition and function to
minimise false positives. This results in inclusion of moderate
to severe, rather than mild, cases of dementia. The main aim of
this exercise is to inform future societal and healthcare needs.
To this end, the dementia case definition is relevant to health
and social policy as it forecasts numbers of people who would
require supportive care owing to moderate or severe cognitive
and functional impairment. Although residents of care homes
were not included in ELSA, we took account of this group using
the statistical joint modelling approach. Furthermore, data from
carers and self reported doctor diagnosis of dementia identified
cases among those unable to take part in the study. Accounting
for non-participation and dropout from the study increased the
obtained incidence rates for dementia, but not by a considerable
amount (see supplementary figure 7), a finding consistent with
the Mayo Clinic Study of Ageing.24
Survival with cardiovascular disease and dementia has improved
over time.5-47 Changes in life expectancy and survival with
cardiovascular disease, functional impairment, or dementia are
accounted for in the model by applying calendar time specific
mortality rates. This method is based on the assumption that
survival with health conditions changes in proportion to changes
in overall life expectancy. This assumption, although reasonable
and commonly applied in modelling studies,3-48 lacks
verification, as evidence on the exact age and sex specific
survival with dementia is rare,5 and it is hard to obtain given
uncertainty over date of onset.
Comparison with other studies
Age specific and sex specific incidence rates of dementia
obtained using the described methods (before correction for
dropouts) were in line with age-sex specific incidence rates
obtained in other European studies, including the population of
England (CFAS-II,13 see supplementary figure 3), Italy (Italian
Longitudinal Study of Ageing),39 and Spain (NEDICES study),40
higher than that in the Rotterdam study12 and relatively lower
than American populations of Minnesota (Mayo Clinic Study
of Ageing)24 and white participants of the Cardiovascular Health
Study (1989-99).41 Although not suitable in a clinical setting,
the similarity of our estimates for age specific dementia
incidence with those of independent studies underpins the
validity of our case definition for dementia at population level.
Several cohorts and regionally representative panel studies have
reported calendar trends in dementia incidence.13 49 Comparing
findings of CFAS I and II studies13 showed a 20% decline in
dementia incidence over 20 years, statistically significant only
in men, using algorithmic diagnosis among participants who
attended reassessment interviews within two years of CFAS-I
(1989-94) and CFAS-II (2008-11). Our results, based, in parallel,
on participants who remained in the study at biennial waves of
ELSA also translate to a 20% decline in dementia incidence
over 20 years. After accounting for the competing effect of
mortality and dropouts, the annual reduction was, as expected,
larger (2.7%). This corresponds to a 42% decline in dementia
incidence over two decades, and it is statistically significant for
both men and women. The corrected dementia trend,
corresponding to a 24% decline for each decade, is consistent
with findings from the Framingham study (20% decline for each
decade across 1977-2008),18 the Rotterdam study
(non-statistically significant 25% lower incidence in the 2000
compared with the 1990 subcohort),12 and the Chicago Health
and Aging project (non-significant 3% annual reduction across
1997-2008).14 Other studies suggested a decline in dementia
incidence, indirectly inferred from comparing prevalence
estimates in Spain50 and Sweden.15 Some studies in the United
States,14 China,51 and Japan52 found no statistically significant
trend. No published study has reported evidence of an increasing
trend in dementia incidence.49
Several plausible explanations support a decline in dementia
incidence over time. Improvement in vascular risk factors,7-53
as well as in education levels, can partly account for the decline
in incidence. In the present study, increased physical activity
accounted for the largest proportion of the decline in dementia
incidence between 2002 and 2013. Changes in prevalence of
diabetes, smoking, and social class over time had negative
confounding effects, such that the downward incidence trend
increased after controlling for respective changes. Adjustment
for stroke and depression did not have a considerable effect on
the calendar trend in dementia.
Policy implications
Basic research efforts to understand the causes of dementia have
increased noticeably in recent years, but to date drug trials have
failed to show modification of disease processes.54 The WHO
and other expert bodies have identified prevention,
identification, and reduction of risk as a top research priority,
in response to the lack of treatment.55 56 Debate continues about
the relative importance of vascular and neurodegenerative
causes. In the context of this uncertainty the IMPACT-BAM

 model is a means to understand how the dementia burden will
evolve, and it provides a platform to measure how the burden
might be reduced through various policy interventions.
Conclusion
Our novel prediction model integrates recent downward trends
in dementia and cardiovascular disease incidence with declining
mortality rates in England and Wales. If these trends continue
then the number of people with dementia will more than likely
increase, from 792 000 in 2017 to more than 1.2 million in 2040.
The projected increase in the burden of dementia, despite the
substantial downward trend in age specific incidence, results
largely from improvements in life expectancy. The results have
important policy implications in terms of care needs and public
spending. The findings of our prediction model act as a
benchmark to measure the impact of possible dementia
prevention initiatives.

 What is already known on this topic
Alzheimer’s Society UK predicts if age specific prevalence of dementia remains constant, there will be over 1.7 million people with
dementia in the UK by 2050
Studies in England, the Netherlands, and United States have shown a decline in dementia incidence over time
What this study adds
The decline in dementia incidence each year in 2002-13 was steeper than that observed in previous studies
The Markov model shows that despite a decline in age specific dementia incidence, overall prevalence of this condition is rising; however,
the increase is not as large as predicted by simple projections of prevalence into the future
This study estimates that by 2040 in England and Wales there will be more than 1.2 million people with dementia, an increase of 57%
from 2016

 Table
Table 1| Summary of assumptions underlying the IMPACT-BAM model
Justification
Assumption
IMPACT-BAM models health transitions in the population of England and Wales aged 35 or more through to death. The input data for the probabilistic Markov
model are the population size in each age and sex stratum, initial health state prevalence values, and transition probabilities by age, sex, and calendar year
Population numbers by age and sex
ONS provides official estimates for population demographics
Estimates for population numbers by sex and five year age groups at
model baseline were obtained from the UK Office for National Statistics
(ONS). At each one calendar year iteration of the model, men and
women reaching age 35 were entered. The predictions for number of
people aged 35 by year were obtained from ONS
Assumption 1: ONS predictions are realistic
Assumption 2: migration is not a major source of bias
Starting prevalence values
Accuracy of prevalence values depends on how well ELSA represents the population of
England and Wales. ELSA study participants aged 50 or more were selected at random.
The core participant’s cohabiting partners, including adults aged less than 50, were also
enrolled in the study. The overall response rate was 67%. To ensure study participants
form a representative sample, survey weights are applied. To maintain representativeness
at every phase of data collection, refreshment samples are recruited to the study periodically.
Initial prevalence of health states in the model by age and sex were
obtained from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA)
Assumption 3: ELSA is a representative sample of the population of
England and Wales
Comparisons of the sociodemographic characteristics of participants against results from
the national census indicated that the ELSA sample was broadly representative of the
English population
The prevalence values obtained from the pooled ELSA data matched the prevalence values
obtained at the mid-point (2006, wave 3). Estimates for prevalence of cardiovascular disease
are displayed as an example in supplementary figure 2
To improve statistical power, six waves of ELSA data were pooled.
Prevalence estimates of cardiovascular disease and cognitive and
functional impairment that define the health states were obtained from
pooled data and attributed to 2006, which is the mid-point of the ELSA
data collection timeframe and the baseline of the model
Assumption 4: Prevalence estimates from six pooled waves of data
provide a precise and accurate estimate of prevalence at mid-point of
the data collection timeframe
Epidemiological concept applied to Markov models
Assumption 5: The prevalence of each health state at each calendar
year from the starting point (2006) onwards, equals the number of
people who were in that health state in the previous year, plus new
incident cases, minus those who made the transition to another health
state or died from any cause. Number of new incident cases and
numbers of death were determined by transition probabilities to and
from that condition
Transition probabilities
Incidence of cardiovascular disease and dementia by age and sex were consistent with
age, and sex specific incidence values obtained from independent external sources for the
corresponding calendar time
Estimates of dementia incidence were available from the Cognitive Function and Ageing
Study II (CFAS II, 2008-11). Incidence of dementia in the corresponding timeframe is
compatible with CFAS-II estimates (see supplementary figure 5).
Deaths predicted by IMPACT-BAM matched with observed and predicted mortality rates
from the ONS (see supplementary figure 13)
Transition probabilities were obtained as a function of age and sex from
incident cases between wave n and n+1 in ELSA. As with estimates of
prevalence values, the transition probabilities obtained from pooling
ELSA epochs were attributed to the mid-point of the data collection
period
Assumption 6: Transition probabilities, (equivalent to incidence by age,
sex, or calendar year) for cardiovascular disease, dementia, functional
impairment, and mortality in ELSA are similar to those for England and
Wales
Modelling is based on a single transition probability for each age, sex, and calendar year
stratum and health transition. The probability of death or development of functional
impairment among those with cardiovascular disease or cognitive impairment is dependent
on the severity of cardiovascular disease or cognitive impairment. Under the assumption
that ELSA participants are a representative sample of the population, the spectrum of the
severity of conditions (eg, cardiovascular disease, or cognitive impairment) observed in
Assumption 7: Transition probabilities are equivalent to a weighted
average across the spectrum of the severity of each condition, thus
varying severities among people in each health state is accounted for.
Similarly, survival of those with each condition is assumed to be
equivalent to the weighted average of survival of people with different
levels of severity
ELSA is proportionate to that at population level. As such, transition probabilities obtained
from ELSA are a weighted average of the transition probabilities across the spectrum of
the severity of the conditions
The weighted average transition probability multiplied by the total number of people in a
health state is mathematically equivalent to the sum of the product of severity specific
transition probabilities and severity specific numbers of people in that health state

 Table 1 (continued)
Justification
Assumption
Since ELSA participants are assumed to be a representative sample of the population of
England after weighting (see above), estimates for risks of dementia, cardiovascular disease,
Assumption 8: The effects of comorbidity (such as diabetes) are
accounted for in the model
functional impairment and death obtained from ELSA reasonably represent a weighted
average of risk levels across the spectrum of the severity of these conditions and
comorbidities
Calendar trends
Transition probabilities (mortality rates and incidence of cardiovascular disease and dementia) change over time
Data obtained from ONS show that cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular mortality rates
followed steady and linear downward trends over the past two decades. We assumed the
most likely scenario would be that these trends will continue (see supplementary figure 3)
Assumption 9: The observed downward calendar trend in mortality rates
over the past two decades will continue to the future
Changes in life expectancy are accounted for by application of mortality rates. As mortality
rates continue to decline, life expectancy will increase
Assumption 10: Life expectancy and maximum lifespan are amenable
to being increased
Age and sex standardised cardiovascular incidence and mortality rates declined in parallel
in ELSA (see supplementary figure 4).
To examine the uncertainty of this assumption, we conducted a sensitivity analysis assuming
incidence of cardiovascular disease does not decline any further (results shown in
supplementary figure 16)
Assumption 11: Trends in incidence of cardiovascular disease over
time are parallel to cardiovascular mortality
A decline in dementia incidence has been reported in studies in England, the Netherlands,
and USA. The magnitude of the calendar trend in England and Wales is less certain. We
determined the calendar trend corrected for deaths and loss to follow-up of study participants,
utilising a robust statistical technique to model ELSA data
We conducted sensitivity analyses with calendar trends estimated from other studies
(including CFAS I and II, and the Framingham study), and an alternative scenario in which
dementia incidence does not decline any further (fig 6⇓)
Assumption 12: Dementia incidence declines over time
Survival in IMPACT-BAM is indirectly modelled as a function of changing mortality rates.
It is assumed that the ratio of mortality rates for each health state in the model compared
with the general population is similar to that observed in ELSA. Thus mortality and survival
for each health state in the model changes in parallel to mortality and survival in the general
population. Current evidence suggests survival with cardiovascular disease and dementia
is improving over time. We did not find evidence suggesting this improvement to be over
and beyond improvement in overall survival
Assumption 13: Survival with cardiovascular disease, dementia, or
functional impairment change over time in parallel to changes in overall
life expectancy
Population levels of risk factors affecting incidence of cardiovascular disease and dementia
such as diabetes, smoking, diet, and physical activity have changed over time. The net
effect of recent changes in risk factors on changes in mortality rates and incidence of
cardiovascular disease and dementia has been steady and linear declining calendar trends
The present analysis forms the baseline modelling scenario. IMPACT-BAM will be utilised
in future to model the health impacts of changes in risk factors and public health interventions
Assumption 14: The most likely net effect of future changes in risk
factors will be the continuation of calendar trends in mortality rates and
incidence of dementia and cardiovascular disease observed over the
past two decades
compared with the baseline scenario. Results of such analysis are extensive and beyond
the scope of this paper
Competing risks
Cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular causes of death are the terminal health states in
the model. Once a person dies from any cause they are no longer at risk of disease. Thus,
competing risks due to both cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular causes are accounted
for in the model
Assumption 15: Deaths due to any cause (including cancer and chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease) and changes in cause specific mortality
rates act as competing risks to development of dementia
