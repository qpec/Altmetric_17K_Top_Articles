ABSTRACT
Clinical consensus is that debridement is necessary for successful application of
dermal skin substitutes (DSS) to chronic wounds. The aim here was to identify
commonly expressed genes associated with wound healing in untreated acute
wounds and chronic wounds treated with wound debridement followed by DSS.
Cutaneous biopsies were taken at two time points from untreated acute and
chronic
wounds
and
from
chronic
wounds
treated
with
DSS
following
debridement. Microarray analysis identified significant differences (p < 0.05)
related to proliferation (HIPK2, LGR4, FGFR1, SRRT), migration (RHOC,
PRPF40A, FGFR1), differentiation (TCF4, COL13A1, GNPTAB, HUWE1,
FGFR1),
angiogenesis
(HIPK2,
CASP8),
extracellular
matrix
organization
(VWA1), and apoptosis (BBC3, HIPK2, KLF11, PSME3, MSFD10, TOP2A,
MLH1, CASP8, PDIA3, XAF1) when comparing untreated chronic wounds to
chronic wounds treated with DSS, with similar expression levels compared to
untreated acute wounds. Chronic wounds treated with debridement followed by
DSS resemble untreated acute wounds at a genomic level. These novel findings,
albeit with limited clinical specimen numbers, strengthen the recommendation
to transform chronic into acute wounds prior to application of DSS.
Chronic wounds, defined as the presence of a wound for
greater than 42 days, occur as a result of deficiencies in
wound healing processes leading to a state of pathological
inflammation followed by incomplete, delayed, and disor-
ganized healing.1,2 Chronic wounds are prevalent as they
affect 3–5% of people aged over 65 years old and present
a major burden on the healthcare system costing an esti-
mated $25 billion per year in the USA.2,3
Management of chronic wounds depends on the underly-
ing etiology and traditional methods can be labor intensive,
inefficient, and expensive. The past thirty years have seen
the development and evolution of dermal skin substitutes
(DSS), which have significantly expanded the treatment of
chronic wounds.4 These bioengineered products resemble
skin in terms of structure, consisting of extracellular matrix
(ECM) materials alone (decellular) or in combination with
cell types such as fibroblasts and keratinocytes (cellular).5
DSS are applied directly to a wound bed and integrated
with surrounding native tissues resulting in accelerated
wound healing by stimulating angiogenesis, cell migration,
and epithelialization.6
Clinical consensus is that effective debridement is neces-
sary for successful application of DSS to chronic wounds.7
The aim of debridement is to transform a chronic non-
healing wound into a more responsive acute wound and to
initiate the process of healing through the removal of senes-
cent and nonresponsive cells.8–10 While the principle for
debridement seems rational, the evidence to support its use
in enhancing wound healing is limited. Clinical findings
have shown similarities between untreated acute wounds at
day 14 and chronic wounds treated with DSS following
wound debridement at day 42 suggesting the importance of
wound bed preparation prior to DSS treatment for the suc-
cessful transformation of chronic into acute wounds.11,12
The aim of this novel study was to support these clinical
observations by identifying genes associated with wound
healing that are commonly up-regulated in untreated acute
wounds and chronic wounds treated with initial debridement
followed by application of DSS.
METHODS
Acute and chronic wounds
Four patients (age: 52–88; males: 2) with chronic venous
ulcers were recruited from our dedicated venous ulcer clin-
ic. A chronic ulcer was defined as a nonhealing wound
that was present for more than 6 weeks. All patients
involved in the study received four layer compression ban-
dage treatment, before and during the study. None of the
patients received any compression treatment on the acute
wounds. On day 0, a total of two 4-mm punch biopsies
were taken from each patient; one from the posterior
aspect of the chronic wound edge and one from normal

 skin at the inner upper arm area (acute wound) (Figure
1A). On day 14, 6-mm punch biopsies were taken over the
acute wound biopsy site in the arm and posterior ulcer
edge in the leg. RNA extraction, microarray processing,
and analysis were performed as previously described by
Shih et al.13 The microarray data used in the analysis has
been previously published.13
Chronic wounds treated with decellularized dermis
Four patients (age: 46–77; male: 1) with treatment-
resistant ulcers were approached in approved clinics.
Treatment resistance was defined as minimal or absent
response to appropriate treatment for more than 3 months.
On day 0, a 5-mm diameter full-thickness (extending
down to hypodermic fat)
skin punch biopsies were
obtained from the wound margin before the ulcer was
debrided using the Versajet hydrosurgery system (Smith
& Nephew, Hull, United Kingdom) (Figure 1B). The
presence
of
punctuate
bleeding
confirmed
successful
debridement and adequate wound bed preparation before
decellularized
dermis
(DCD)
placement
(DermaPure,
Tissue Regenix Wound Care Incorporated). A 5 3 5 cm
sheet of DCD was cut to the dimensions of the wound
using standard sterile instruments, applied, and fixed in
place using liquid skin adhesive (Dermabond; Ethicon,
San Lorenzo, Puerto Rico) around the ulcer margin.
Once dry, the PICO negative pressure wound system
(Smith & Nephew) was applied. It consists of a small
portable pump connected via tubing to a dressing overly-
ing the wound, which exerts 80 mmHg pressure across
the wound bed for 7 days. Further 5-mm full-thickness
skin biopsies were taken at day 42. Biopsies were taken
at the wound margin so that, macroscopically, half the
tissue was ulcerated and half appeared to be normal peri-
ulcerous tissue. RNA extraction, microarray processing,
and analysis were performed as previously described by
Greaves et al.12

patient; one from the posterior aspect of the chronic leg wound and one from normal skin at the inner upper arm area. On
day 14, 6-mm punch biopsies were taken over the acute wound biopsy site in the arm and posterior ulcer edge in the leg.
RNA extraction, microarray processing, and analysis were performed on the biopsy samples. (B) On day 0, a 5-mm punch
biopsy was obtained from the chronic leg wound before debridement and DCD application. On day 42, a 5-mm punch biopsy
was taken from the chronic lower leg wound which had been treated with debridement and DCD application. RNA extraction,
microarray processing, and analysis were performed on the biopsy samples. ABPI, ankle brachial pressure index; AW, acute

 Statistical analysis
Fold change ratios of normalized data for genes were cal-
culated. For acute wounds and chronic wounds treated
with DCD, genes with fold change ratio of >1.01 were
identified. For chronic wound normalized data genes with
fold change ratio of <1.01 were identified. Genes which
were up-regulated in acute and chronic wounds treated
with DCD (fold change ratio >1.01) and those same genes
subsequently
down-regulated
in
chronic
wounds
(fold
change ratio <1.01) were highlighted. Those genes carry-
ing “proliferation,” “migration,” “angiogenesis,” “ECM
organization,” and “apoptosis” gene ontology terms were
categorized into wound healing processes. Using Student’s
t-test, significant differentially expressed genes between
chronic wounds and chronic wounds treated with DCD
were identified (with a p-value of <0.05 considered statis-
tically significant). Data were analyzed using Microsoft
Excel 2010 and Qlucore Omics Explorer 2.3 (Qlucore,
Lund, Sweden) was used to identify the biological process-
es of relevant genes.
RESULTS
The healing of all three cohort of wounds were evaluated
using a combination of noninvasive subjective and objec-
tive
methods
including
patient
and
assessor
wound
assessments; 2D and 3D photography to measure wound
surface area and volume, respectively; full-field laser per-
fusion imaging (FLPI) to assess wound perfusion; and
spectrophotometric
intracutaneous
analysis
(SIAscopy)
enabling in vivo quantification of cutaneous oxyhemoglo-
bin, melanin, and dermal collagen concentrations.12,13 All
patients treated with debridement and DCD application
showed improved wound healing over the study period as
shown by accelerated wound closure rate and increased
rate of blood flow into the wound.
Whole genome analysis identified 13,990 genes with
increased expression in acute wounds between day 0 and
day 14. There was increased expression of 12,261 genes in
chronic wounds treated with DCD between day 0 and day
42. There was a decrease or no change in the expression
of 21,593 genes in chronic wounds between day 0 and day
14. After reviewing these initial datasets, 2,120 of these
genes had an increased expression in acute wounds and
chronic wounds treated with DCD and were subsequently
found to be inactive or down-regulated in chronic wounds.
Gene function for this group of 2,120 genes was studied
and 193 genes were associated with proliferation, 105 with
migration, 206 with differentiation, 59 with angiogenesis,
22 with ECM organization, and 194 with apoptosis.
Further gene function of this smaller group was studied
to identify genes related to wound healing with significant

 altered expression between chronic wounds and chronic
wounds treated with DCD (Tables 1 and S1). This found
four genes related to the positive regulation of cell prolifera-
tion (HIPK2, LGR4, FGFR1, and SRRT). Three genes were
related to the positive regulation of cell migration (RHOC,
PRPF40A, and FGFR1). Five genes were related to cell dif-
ferentiation (TCF4, COL13A1, GNPTAB, HUWE1, and
FGFR1). Two genes were related to angiogenesis (HIPK2
and CASP8) and a single gene was related to ECM organi-
zation (VWA1). Ten genes were related to the positive reg-
ulation of apoptosis (BBC3, HIPK2, KLF11, PSME3,
MSFD10, TOP2A, MLH1, CASP8, PDIA3, and XAF1)
(Figure 2).
DISCUSSION
This novel whole genome microarray study has enabled
the identification of commonly expressed genes in acute
wounds and chronic wounds treated with debridement prior
to application of DSS. We identified several dormant genes,
with known biological functions involved in wound healing
processes, in chronic wounds which had a significantly
altered expression (p < 0.05) in chronic wounds treated with
debridement proceeded by DSS application. These trends in
gene expression identified, suggest wound debridement pro-
vides a key function of transforming chronic indolent
wounds into active acute wounds. The importance of chron-
ic wound debridement prior to application of DSS has been
shown clinically where only 15% of skin grafts were incor-
porated successfully into wounds where chronic granulation
tissue was not adequately prepared through appropriate
debridement.14 It is also important to note that initial wound
bed debridement and treatment with DSS are effective in
combination. It is unlikely that initial wound bed debride-
ment
alone would
produce
such
sustained
benefit
as
common chronic wound literature dictates the need for mul-
tiple ongoing debridement procedures in the management of
chronic wounds.15 Based on our findings, we propose an
effective initial wound debridement transforms a chronic
wound into an acute wound and DSS application allows
maintenance of this transformation.
We have previously shown chronic wounds treated with
debridement followed by DSS resemble untreated acute
wounds through noninvasive assessment techniques. Ud-
Din et al showed a surface area reduction of 60% and a
51% increase in mean hemoglobin flux using FLPI in
untreated acute wounds at day 14.11 Greaves et al. found
similar findings at day 42 following chronic wound
debridement and application of DCD (49.5% surface area
reduction and 50% increase in mean hemoglobin flux).12
This provided our justification to use the two time points
for comparing acute wounds with treated chronic wounds
on days 14 and 42, respectively.
Several of the genes identified above have previously
been confirmed as key regulators in skin development,
homeostasis, and cutaneous wound healing. LGR4 has
been identified as a basal cell proliferator and plays an
important role in the development and maintenance of
skin.16,17 TCF4 is a major regulator of fibroblast to myo-
fibroblast differentiation as identified in an ex vivo
chronic wound model.18 FGFR1 expression is decreased
in chronic wounds19 and augmented in wound healing20
with its deficiency severely impairing wound contraction
and delaying reepithelialization through impaired kerati-
nocyte migration.21 RHOA has been identified to have a
role in keratinocyte migration and RHOC has partially
overlapping functions.22 CASP8 has been found to be
involved in wound healing processes and is a key regula-
tor in skin homeostasis.23 Under-expression of CASP8
has been observed in wounded skin and loss of its

 function leads to chronic inflammation with development
of atopic-dermatitis like skin disease.24,25 The genes dis-
cussed
above
suggest
that
their
under-expression
in
untreated chronic wounds may account for the chronic
inflammatory state of these wounds and the delayed heal-
ing observed. The subsequent over-expression of these
genes and the others identified in healing wounds (acute
wounds and chronic wounds treated with debridement fol-
lowed by DCD application) may explain the hypothesis
that
differential
regulation
of
these
genes
improves
wound healing.
This study has several limitations. The overall sample size
used was small and the analyses does raise the possibility of
identifying false positive results. Unfortunately, in view of
limited tissue availability we were unable to perform further
confirmatory testing. We acknowledge the findings from this
study are preliminary and future studies are recommended to
validate these microarray genomic findings including quanti-
tative PCR, morphological and immunohistochemical analy-
ses. Future studies should address factors such as sample
size and the possibility of conducting all three phases of this
study in the same subject.
In conclusion, we have presented novel whole genome
microarray data supporting the clinical recommendation
for chronic wound transformation into an acute wound
with effective debridement prior to the application of DSS.
