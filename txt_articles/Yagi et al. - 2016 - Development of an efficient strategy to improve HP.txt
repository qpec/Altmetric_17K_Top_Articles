Abstract
Background: In Japan, new HPV immunizations have dropped dramatically after repeated adverse media reports
and a June 2013 temporary suspension of the government’s recommendation for the vaccine. The aim of the
present study was to develop an efficient strategy to improve HPV immunization coverage across Japan.
Methods: We conducted an internet survey in Japan of mothers of 12–16 year-old girls who were unvaccinated as
of May, 2015. The goal was to gather behavioral information from the mothers to develop a strategy for improving
Japanese HPV immunization coverage.
Results: Valid survey answers were obtained from 2060 mothers. The survey found that a hypothetical restart of a
governmental recommendation for the vaccine would induce 4.1 % of all the mothers surveyed to be more likely
to encourage vaccination of their daughters, without any other preconditions. This initial result would be followed
by a moderate spread of vaccinations to these daughters’ close friends and acquaintances, hypothetically resulting
in a total vaccination rate of 21.0 % of the targeted age-eligible girls. As a second critical step for improving
vaccinations, an educational information sheet integrating the concepts of behavioral economics for changing
behaviors was found to be significantly effective for persuading mothers with poorer decision-making facilities, who
would otherwise prefer to wait to first see the vaccination of other girls of the same age as their daughter.
Conclusions: Following what we foresee as the inevitable restart of the Japanese government’s recommendation for
receiving the HPV vaccine, we expect to first see vaccinations occurring in a very small group of girls, the daughters of
the most willing mothers, which will be roughly 4 % of those eligible for government paid vaccinations. This will be
followed by the spread of vaccinations outward through these girls’ circle of friends and acquaintances, and, finally, to
the daughters of the most skeptical mothers, those who would await the return of new vaccine safety results from a
large group of similarly-aged girls. As a critical step in improving HPV vaccine coverage in Japan, an educational
information sheet that integrates the concepts of behavioral economics for changing behaviors can be employed to
persuade mothers with poor decision-making facilities.

 Background
In many developing countries women have a relatively
high risk for cervical cancer because efficient and afford-
able early-detection screening programs for the disease
are largely lacking, [1]. In Japan, a developed country
with a very high standard of living and Human Develop-
ment Index, cervical cancer screening is both highly effi-
cient and affordable, yet the country’s screening rate is
abysmally low in its youngest at-risk age groups; it is
only 10 % for women aged 20–25, and 24 % in those
26–30. For this and other reasons, the incidence of cer-
vical cancer in Japan, especially for women in their
twenties and thirties, is rising steadily [2].
In both developing and developed countries, the sexu-
ally transmitted human papillomavirus (HPV) is recog-
nized as the leading cause of cervical cancer. HPV
contributes to several other cancers as well, i.e., vulvar,
vaginal, penile, anal, and oropharyngeal cancers [3]. The
preventive efficacy of the HPV vaccine against HPV in-
fection and HPV-associated precancerous lesions is well
established [4], indicating that the widest possible dis-
semination of the vaccine is crucial in reducing the risk
for HPV-associated cervical cancer. However, in some
countries, and for various reasons, HPV vaccination is
not going as well as it should [5–7], which is creating
the risk of a disaster.
In Japan, the HPV vaccination rate for age-eligible
young girls was as high as 70 ~ 80 % in 2011 and 2012
[8]. By April of 2013, the HPV vaccine program was
doing so well that it was added to the government’s list
of suggested routine vaccinations, under the Preventive
Vaccination Law, which suggested that it be applied to
all 12–16 year-old girls (after obtaining an informed
consent from their parents or guardians). However, just
a few months later, a series of adverse medical events were
alleged to have occurred following HPV immunization. By
June of 2013, the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour, and
Welfare (MHLW) had temporarily suspended its recom-
mendation for adolescent HPV vaccination [9]. As a direct
result of this suspension, the rate of HPV vaccination
among adolescent girls in Japan immediately plummeted
[8, 10]. By late 2013, the HPV vaccination rate of age-
eligible girls in Sakai, Osaka had fallen from the previous
year’s 70–80 % to just 3.9 % [10]. By 2014, the rate in
Sapporo, Hokkaido had fallen even further, to 0.6 % [10].
In order to better understand the behavioral basis for
this dramatic decrease in the HPV vaccination rate in
Japan, so as to reverse the fall, we had previously con-
ducted an internet survey in March of 2014 [11]. Our
survey results found that a young woman’s acceptance of
receiving the HPV vaccine was determined predomin-
antly by her mother’s perceptions of the risks versus the
benefits of the vaccine, rather than by the daughter’s
own perceptions of it. In our follow-up study, we have
conducted a large-scale internet survey of mothers of
unvaccinated 12–16 year-old daughters to investigate a
more efficient strategy for improving HPV immunization
coverage in Japan.
Methods
The goals of our internet survey included an analysis of the
factors that influenced a mothers’ intent to recommend
that their daughters receive the HPV vaccination. We
looked at a number of different qualifiers under the current
anti-HPV-vaccine climate and under a hypothetical situ-
ation wherein the government had restarted its recommen-
dation for the vaccine. We looked at several preconditions
the mothers might require being fulfilled prior to recom-
mending their daughters’ vaccination. We also examined
the efficacy of distributing an educational information sheet
concerning cervical cancer, which included information
regarding the safety and the efficacy of the HPV vaccine in
reducing the risk of cervical cancer. We looked at the ef-
fects of this information sheet on the mothers’ intention to
inoculate their daughters, and for an association between
the mothers’ decision-making facilities and their intent to
recommend their daughters’ vaccination.
On May 25th and 26th of 2015, we performed an
internet survey of Japanese mothers of 12–16 year-old
daughters who had not yet been vaccinated. Before con-
ducting the main survey, 10,000 mothers, listed in an
internet survey panel as having such daughters, and as
being willing to answer a questionnaire, were pre-
screened with questions about their daughters’ age and
whether their daughter had yet received the HPV vac-
cine. If they had two or more daughters, they were asked
to answer only in respect to the oldest daughter. The
main survey was then distributed by e-mail to 4000
mothers who satisfied these criteria, from which we ob-
tained 2060 valid responses (51.5 %).
The mothers were first asked about their recognition
of the optimal time for HPV vaccination for the general
population of girls, and about what they considered to
be the most practical timing for their own daughters.
Next, we investigated what sorts of preconditions the
mothers would require be met before recommending
their daughters’ HPV vaccination. Based on the results
of this initial set of questions, the mothers were then di-
vided into five groups, as follows: Group A: Mothers
who would vaccinate their daughters for HPV without
any preconditions, even under a continued recommen-
dation suspension (subset Group A-willing), and those
who
would
vaccinate
their
daughters
immediately
after a recommendation restart, without other precon-
ditions (subset Group A-restart); Group B: Mothers
who would have their daughters vaccinated only after
seeing safe inoculation of the daughter’s close friends
and acquaintances; Group C: Mothers who would

 vaccinate their daughters only after seeing the safe in-
oculation of many other girls of the same general age;
Group D: Mothers who would stipulate a range of
other preconditions before they would allow their
daughters to be vaccinated; Group E: Mothers who
wouldn’t
encourage
inoculation
of
their
daughters
under any circumstances. The preconditions, of ‘Vac-
cinate only after friends and acquaintances have been
safely inoculated’
, and ‘Vaccinate only after many girls
of the same general age have been safely inoculated’
,
were defined as Preconditions 1 and 2, respectively.
We sought to determine what message content on the in-
formation sheet we provided was the most effective at posi-
tive motivation, and the characteristics of the target
population for whom individual content was most effective.
Of the 394 mothers who had responded that their attitude
toward the HPV vaccine was favorably altered after reading
the educational leaflet, we asked which message points they
gave the most weight to concerning helping them make a
more favorable decision about their daughters’ HPV vaccin-
ation. The answers for each question were scored, and the
average score was compared for each group. Scoring was as
follows: Very applicable: 2, Applicable: 1, Intermediate: 0,
Not applicable: -1. The degree of importance for each infor-
mation point was evaluated by its mean score. The higher
the number, the more importance the mothers gave it when
making their hypothetical decision regarding their daugh-
ters’ real-world HPV vaccination.
As part of the survey study, an educational informa-
tion sheet about cervical cancer and HPV vaccination
was presented to the mothers. Its purpose was to evalu-
ate whether educational intervention was effective for
increasing the number of mothers who would encourage
their daughters to be vaccinated (Fig. 1). To develop a
more effective educational information sheet, we used
concepts from the field of behavioral economics. Behav-
ioral economics deals with ‘irrational’ economic actors
and actions. Previous studies suggested that people often
made decisions that deviated from what was expected of
‘rational’ economic actors, and that these decisions were
powerfully influenced by their context and reference
points [12]. One study showed that using simple posters
prompting clinicians to consider their vulnerable patients
substantially increased their rates of handwashing [13].
The educational information sheet in the present study
was created following a preliminary survey of mothers of
12–16 year-old girls. Mothers used solely for this purpose
were not enrolled in the larger internet survey.
Statistics
Fisher’s exact test was used to analyze for statistically
significant changes in the mothers’ attitudes towards
their daughters’ vaccination (Fig. 2). The chi-square test
combined with residual analysis was used to investigate
the association between the mothers’ attitudes and their
decision-making facilities (Table 6). The level of statis-
tical significance was set at p = 0.05.

Characteristics of the internet survey responders
The relevant characteristics of the survey responders are
shown in Table 1. The areas of residence of the responders
are distributed fairly consistently with other vital statistic
reports for Japan (http://www.ipss.go.jp/syoushika/tohkei/
Popular/P_Detail2015.asp?fname=T09-05.htm). The educa-
tional background of the respondents was also consistent
with the national population census (http://www.stat.-

 validate that we had a sufficiently broad representation of
study respondents.
Attitudes of mothers at the beginning of the survey
towards HPV vaccination for their daughters
The initial survey questions pertained to the mothers’ pre-
existing attitudes towards getting an HPV vaccination for
their daughters, given the current state of Japan’s govern-
ment’s suspension of its recommendation of the vaccine. At
this initial point in the survey, only 250 (12.1 %) of the
2060 respondents indicated they were willing to have their
daughters vaccinated. The vast majority of responders,
1810 (87.9 %), said they were not currently planning to vac-
cinate their daughters. Of this larger group, 977 (47.4 %)
responded they were unsure or hesitant as to whether or
not they were going to recommend their daughter receive
the vaccination; the remaining 843 (40.5 %) were clearly un-
willing to recommend the vaccination (Fig. 2(a)).
Recognition of optimal vaccination timing for girls in
general and for their own daughter
Of the 1810 mothers who stated at the beginning of the
survey that they were not currently planning to vaccin-
ate their daughters, we inquired about their recognition
of the optimal timing for the general population of ado-
lescents to receive the HPV vaccination, and about what
they considered to be a realistic timing for their own
daughter’s vaccination. Even among those mothers who
were initially strongly opposed to the HPV vaccine, more
than half (57.6 %) correctly recognized that the most
effective timing for HPV vaccination was when given
before sexual debut, whereas only 2.4 % incorrectly
thought that giving the vaccination just before preg-
nancy was the most effective timing (Table 2). However,

 almost half of these knowledgeable mothers (47.3 %)
still intended to put off the vaccination of their own
daughters. Reasons given were: 36.8 % would not get
their daughters vaccinated until they became an adult;
and 10.5 % thought they should wait until the first
pregnancy (Table 2).
Under a hypothetical scenario of a restart of the
governmental recommendation, changes in mothers’
attitude towards daughters’ vaccination
Among the 2060 responding mothers, when given a
hypothetical scenario of ‘a recommendation restart’
, 433
(21.0 %) became obviously more willing to get their
daughters vaccinated. On the other hand, 1627 (79.0 %)
remained skeptical or were otherwise still unwilling to
vaccinate their daughters (Fig. 2(b)). We found that the
number of willing mothers was significantly increased
under the hypothetical recommendation restart scenario
(p < 0.001, by Fisher’s exact test).
Preconditions mothers would require to happen before
seeking their daughters’ HPV vaccination
We investigated the other preconditions some of the
mothers might require be met before they would encour-
age their daughters’ HPV vaccination. In the group of 250
willing mothers, only 2.0 % (five) answered that they
would vaccinate their daughters without any specific pre-
conditions occurring first (Table 3). 26.4 % (66) answered
that they would vaccinate their daughters only after ob-
serving the inoculation of friends or acquaintances of their
daughter (set as precondition 1), whereas almost twice as
many mothers, 47.6 % (1.8 times, 119), answered that they
would vaccinate their daughters only after witnessing the
safe vaccination of many girls of the same age group as

 their daughter (set as precondition 2). In other words, al-
most half the women thought that a recommendation re-
start combined with evidence of a safe vaccination of
those closest to them was still insufficient for motivating
them to change their minds and recommend the vaccin-
ation to their daughter. These results implied that even
willing mothers usually stipulated some preconditions be-
fore they would recommend their daughters’ inoculation.
Next, we analyzed the survey responses from the 1810
mothers who answered that their intentions were uncer-
tain or that they were unwilling to vaccinate their daugh-
ters under the current suspension of governmental
recommendation. Among those who were willing to in-
oculate their daughter under the hypothetical scenario of
a recommendation restart, the ratio of mothers having a
strict requirement for precondition 2 versus 1 was 1.7
(50.3 to 29.0 %). Among those who were unsure whether
to vaccinate even under this scenario, the ratio was 3.4
(63.4 to 18.8 %). Among those who decided they would
not inoculate their daughters, even under the scenario of a
recommendation restart, the ratio was 6.6 (24.7 to 3.7 %).
These results imply that the preconditions mothers might
require prior their daughters’ inoculation were well corre-
lated with their positive or negative intentions for the sub-
sequent vaccination of their daughters.
Based upon their responses to the hypothetical restart
scenario, we divided the mothers into five groups ac-
cording to the preconditions they stipulated, as shown
in Table 3. Of all mothers surveyed, the percentage of
Group A mothers who intended to vaccinate their
daughters without any pre-requirements was only 4.1 %
(5 + 47 + 33 = 85, out of 2060). The percentage of Group
B was 16.9 % of the total (66 + 53 + 210 + 19 = 348, out
of 2060), resulting in a total ‘hypothetical vaccination
rate’ after a ‘hypothetical recommendation restart’ of
21.0 % (5 + 47 + 33 + 66 + 53 + 210 + 19 = 433/2060). The
percentage of Group C was 50.8 % (119 + 92 + 709 + 126
= 1046/2060). Groups A, B, and C, which were thought
to be immediate targets for induction of their daughters’
vaccination after restart of the governmental recommen-
dation, accounted for 71.8 % of all mothers surveyed.
Effect of behavioral economics-based messages provided
to mothers to promote desired decision-making towards
the daughters’ HPV vaccination
Utilizing perspectives gained from the field of behavioral
economics, we designed five message sheets to promote the
mothers making a decision in favor of their daughters’ HPV
vaccination, as shown in Table 4. After the educational
messages were presented to them in the mid-point of the
survey form, we explored changes in the mothers’ attitude
towards their daughters’ HPV vaccination, continuing with
the scenario of a hypothetical recommendation restart. Be-
fore reading the message sheets, 27.3 % of the mothers
(562/2060) had said they would be willing to direct that
their daughters receive the HPV vaccine. After reading the
educational messages, the percentage of mothers willing to
recommend the vaccine increased significantly, from 21.0
to 27.3 % (p < 0.001, by Fisher’s exact test, Fig. 2(c)), sug-
gesting some efficacy for the messages for attitude-change.
Message elements that aided deciding to seek daughters’
vaccination
“Evaluation of safety by experts”, “Recommendation
from a doctor” and “Recommendation from the national
Table 4 Educational messages
Content of the messages
Message 1: Loss of future fertility by not vaccinating
-Invasive cervical cancer in younger women has doubled, compared
to 20 years ago
-Hysterectomy is usually needed for invasive cervical cancer, even if it
is found at an early stage, and afterwards the patient can’t conceive
Message 2: Loss of the future benefits by postponement of vaccination
-Efficacy of HPV vaccine is reduced if girl not inoculated before first
sexual intercourse
Message 3: Expectations for the vaccine (dispelling the negative image
of adverse events)
-The Nobel Prize was awarded for discovery of HPV
-The vaccine has been developed through study for as long as
20 years after discovery of HPV
-The vaccine has been approved in about 120 countries/regions
worldwide
Message 4: Comparison of future benefits by vaccination with near-term
losses
-The vaccine is effective in preventing cervical cancer, with a
probability of 60–70 % in the future
-Severe adverse events occur after vaccination in only about 0.007 %
of girls
Message 5: Safety of vaccination (changing the focus away from serious
adverse events)
-HPV vaccine is given safely in about 99.993 % of girls
Message 1 was created using the theory of ‘loss avoidance’, which is one of
the most representative theories in behavioral economics. By emphasizing the
increase of cervical cancer incidence in younger women compared to 20 years
ago, and the possibility of needing to undergo a hysterectomy for cervical
cancer, Message 1 explains the magnitude of loss caused by avoiding
vaccination. Conservative mothers usually attempt to minimize change.
Message 2 aimed to make conservative mothers recognize future loss caused
by postponement of vaccination; it told them that selecting the conservative
status quo meant selecting the possibility of their daughter suffering cervical
cancer [2]. Message 3 conveyed information to increase confidence in the
reliability and safety of the vaccine, because many of the mothers obviously
felt uneasy about it. This message encouraged the mothers to perceive of the
vaccination more positively by dispelling the near-term-loss image of adverse
events. Message 4 used a numeric comparison of the merits and risks of
vaccination. It showed how unwillingness to vaccinate their daughters meant
selection of future bad consequences for them. For creating Message 5, we
utilized the framing theory of behavioral economics, by creating a way to
show numerical data that significantly affects decision-making. In this
message, the safety of the HPV vaccine was expressed by the impressive-
looking number of 99.993 %, thus changing the focus from the rare probability
of severe adverse events, 0.007 % [14]

 and local governments” (scores of 1.44, 1.19, and 0.91,
respectively) were regarded as most important message
elements by mothers in Group A, whereas these three
messages had a lower range of importance in the other
groups (0.90–1.41, 0.24–1.14, and 0.07–0.88, respect-
ively) (Table 5). In Group B, the “Opinion of her hus-
band or family” and “Opinion of person close to her”
were more critical than for mothers in the other groups.
In the same way, detailed information about adverse
events, such as “Clinical outcome of the cases with the
adverse events” and “Frequency of adverse events” were
more important for motivating those mothers in Groups
C and D than in Groups A and B.
These results imply that just receiving a recommenda-
tion letter from the national or local government might
be sufficient to induce many mothers in Group A to vac-
cinate their daughters, whereas highly focused informative
messages were required to make the mothers in Groups
C, D, and E change their mind and inoculate their daugh-
ters. In each group of mothers there appears to be a differ-
ent way needed to change their attitudes toward HPV
vaccination.

The association between the decision-making facility of
the mother and her attitude toward her daughters’ HPV
vaccination was investigated next. We evaluated the
mother’s decision-making facility by asking whether or
not she usually felt it was difficult to make decisions in
her daily life. The mothers who felt they were able to
make
decisions
easily
were
classified
into
a
high
decision-making facility group, and those who were not
able to make decisions easily were classified into a low
Table 5 Degree of importance the mothers rated the message points when making a decision concerning their daughters’ actual
HPV vaccination
Group A: Mothers who would vaccinate their daughters without preconditions, even under recommendation suspension (Group A-willing), and those who would
vaccinate their daughters immediately after a recommendation restart, without other preconditions (Group A-restart)
Group B: Mothers who would vaccinate their daughters only after inoculation of close friends and acquaintances
Group C: Mothers who would vaccinate their daughters only after inoculation of many other girls of the same age group
Group D: Mothers who would stipulate other preconditions before they will vaccinate their daughters
Group E: Mothers who wouldn’t inoculate their daughters under any circumstances
The answers for each question were scored and the average score was compared for each group. Scoring was as follows: Very applicable: 2, Applicable: 1,
Intermediate: 0, Inapplicable: -1, Not applicable at all: -2

 decision-making facility group. The survey found that
the mothers’ attitudes towards HPV vaccination, under
the current situation of recommendation suspension, was
not related to their decision-making facility (p = 0.14, by
the chi-square test) (Table 6). However, their ability to
change their attitudes under the scenario of a recommen-
dation restart did tend to be associated with their
decision-making facility (p = 0.065, by chi-square test).
Those having the highest decision-making facility
also initially tended to be the most stubbornly resist-
ant to changing their minds towards inoculating their
daughters following just the restart scenario, and even
more so after reading the information sheets. The
shift in group numbers, from unwilling, to unsure, to
willing, could be seen.
Most interestingly, after presentation of the educational
information, the mothers who had a lower decision-making
facility tended to be the ones who were most positively in-
fluenced by the educational material. The chi-square test
combined with residual analysis revealed that, among those
who were initially unwilling to inoculate their daughters,
the ratio of the number of the mothers of high decision-
making facility versus the number of those of low decision-
making facility was significantly higher (283/144) than
among those who were unsure (627/444), and those who
were willing (326/236) (p < 0.05). This strongly indicates an
educational intervention might be a more effective means
to induce those with a low decision-making facility to de-
cide to inoculate their daughters.
Discussion
The goals of the present study were to survey Japanese
mothers about their intentions regarding recommending
that their daughters’ receive an HPV vaccination, and to
examine how those intentions might best be positively
changed. Our previous internet survey suggested that a
young woman’s acceptance of the HPV vaccine, under
the current anti-vaccine climate in Japan, is determined
predominantly by her mother’s perceptions concern-
ing the vaccine [11]. A mere listing of dry facts about
cervical cancer and the safety of the HPV vaccine has
been shown to be largely ineffective for changing a
mothers’ attitude.
In the present analysis, we have demonstrated that, in
general, Japanese mothers tend to put off their daugh-
ters’ vaccination, even when they understood that the
most appropriate inoculation timing was during their
early teenage years, before sexual activity usually begins
(Table 2). Our survey found that the less willing the
mothers were to seek their daughters’ vaccination, the
more stringent were the preconditions they stipulated
before they would change their mind (Table 3). We also
demonstrated that it will be extremely difficult to im-
prove vaccination rates because of the negative images
about the HPV vaccine indoctrinated into the mothers’
minds by the extensive reporting, by both regular and
social media, of the alleged severe adverse post-vaccine
events, and by the government’s suspension of its own
recommendation for receiving the HPV vaccine. Today,
3 years and counting after the government announced
its recommendation suspension, only 12.1 % of the
mothers responded that they are willing to make their
daughters receive the HPV vaccine (Fig. 2(a)). Moreover,
even among those mothers with positive attitudes to-
wards the vaccine, the number who answered they were
willing to recommend their daughters get vaccinated,
without any specific preconditions being met, was only
2.0 % (Table 3). Of all 2060 responding mothers, an in-
finitesimal 0.24 % were openly willing to recommend
vaccination, corresponding roughly to the actual current
rate of new HPV vaccinations occurring in Japan ([8],
and our unpublished data).
Most mothers, even those with an initial positive
appreciation toward the HPV vaccine, stipulated some
preconditions for their daughters’ HPV vaccination. Not
surprisingly, these stipulated preconditions became stric-
ter in parallel with the mothers’ initial degree of negative
intentions to make their daughters get vaccinated. The
percentage of Group B (acquaintances first) mothers was
6.6 times as high as those in Group C (many other girls
in same age group), whereas that was 1.8 times Group
A–willing-regardless,
1.7
times
the
Group
A-after-
restart, and 3.4 times the Group C-unsures.
The percentage of Group A mothers who intended to
vaccinate their daughters without any preconditions was
only 4.1 % of all mothers (85 / 2060). The percentage of
Group B mothers was 16.9 % of the total (348/2060),

(433/2060).
Group

represented

%
of
all
mothers (1046 / 2060), resulting in a hypothetical
best case total vaccination rate of 71.8 %.
These findings are supported in a different way by the
results shown in Table 5. A recommendation for the
HPV vaccine from authorities, including doctors, ex-
perts, or the government, was sufficient to convince the
Group A mothers (those who intended to make their
daughters vaccinate under the current recommendation
suspension or soon after a recommendation restart) to
make a decision in favor of their daughters’ vaccination;
whereas more detailed information about the adverse
events was shown to be required for mothers who stipu-
lated more strict preconditions before undertaking in-
oculation, or who otherwise would not vaccinate their
daughters (Groups C, D and E).
Next, we analyzed several educational messages used
to attempt to induce the mothers to make their daugh-
ters vaccinate. Five educational messages were created
utilizing the principles of a sub-field of behavioral
science known as behavioral economics, which is the
study of the effects of psychological, social, cognitive,
and emotional factors on the economic decisions of indi-
viduals and their consequences for market prices, values,
returns, and resource allocation. Behavioral economics
explores why people sometimes make irrational deci-
sions, and why and how their behavior does not
always follow the predictions of economic or medical
health models.
In our previous study [12], we found that a mere re--
statement of the dry facts concerning cervical cancer
and the HPV vaccine, including its safety and efficacy,
was largely ineffective in changing a reluctant mother’s
attitudes. For the current study, we developed and pre-
sented five redesigned message sheets, using behavioral
economics guidelines to guide the wording. These new
sheets were found to be significantly more effective at
increasing the numbers of mothers who intended to
make their daughters vaccinate (p < 0.001) (Fig. 2 (c)).
The decision-making facility of the mothers, and how
that trait related to their attitude toward their daughters’
HPV vaccination, was further investigated. Interestingly,
the mother’s attitude of whether or not to make their
daughters vaccinate under the current recommendation
suspension was not associated with their decision-
making facility (p = 0.14). The mothers who felt they had
a high decision-making facility tended significantly to
not want to inoculate their daughters, whereas those of
low decision-making facility (indecisive) tended to be
easily influenced to inoculate their daughters by reading
the educational messages. This suggests that the educa-
tional intervention approach might be the most effective
for inducing those of low decision-making facility to de-
cide to inoculate their daughters.
Based on our latest survey information, and given the
current reality of a lack of governmental support, we can
now ask: How can we utilize the message sheet method
to most effectively persuade mothers to decide in favor
of HPV vaccination for their daughters? We accept that
it is virtually impossible to survey everybody, or to get
completely honest responses, in order to then target in-
dividualized messages to mothers’ based in advance on
their answers to survey questions about their present at-
titudes toward the HPV vaccine, or the preconditions
which they might stipulate for inoculation of their
daughters, or their decision-making facility.
Based on the results of the present study, we propose
that a stepped strategy might work. For the willing
mothers, who would fall into Groups A and B, a well-
publicized official announcement of the restart of rec-
ommendation, or even declarative statements by medical
experts about the vaccine’s safety, will be sufficient; for
them, additional intervention should not be required. In
the case of a recommendation restart, these mothers will
be the first to start inoculation of their daughters, result-
ing in a vaccination rate of roughly 4 %, possibly within
a few months from a recommendation restart. These
girls’ friends and acquaintances will be reassured about
the vaccine’s safety and will feel peer pressure to receive
the HPV vaccination soon after, without any additional
intervention, because their mothers tend to put great
value on the opinions of their family and friends
(Table 3). This second wave should result in a vaccin-
ation rate approaching 21.0 %.
However, the next steps will be painfully incremental.
There will be roughly 50 % of the mothers who will not
vaccinate their daughters until they see that many other
girls in the same generation as their daughters have been
safely vaccinated first. These mothers will likely stipulate
a requirement to be provided with detailed information
about any potential for new adverse events that might
occur, no matter how unlikely or inconsequential. For
this group of hard sales, an educational sheet providing
safety information utilizing behavioral economics to
guide the wording might be effectively used.
In the present study, the mothers who would stipulate a
requirement for vaccination of many girls in the same gen-
eration as their daughters, irrespective of the governmental
recommendation status, were the largest sub-population in
our study (1046 out of 2060; 50.8 %) (Table 3). If this popu-
lation could be persuaded to vaccinate, the coverage rate
might approach 70 %. In such a situation, many mothers
will feel peer pressure, that everyone else is safely receiving
the HPV vaccination, and it will influence them.
Our study has its limitations. In the internet survey, the
mothers answered questions regarding their intention to
Yagi et al. BMC Public Health  (2016) 16:1013 
Page 9 of 11
 vaccinate their daughters under hypothetical situations.
The results might not necessarily predict the vaccination
rate under real situations. Additionally, although the net
effect of the educational information we provided did in-
crease the mothers’ intention for inoculation, it improved
only to 27.3 %, and this rate might not necessarily fulfill
the precondition requirement for a recognition that ‘many
girls of the same age group have been safely inoculated’.
Further refinements in the types, amounts, timing and de-
livery systems for these educational tools will be required
to overcome this gap.
Conclusions
In conclusion, our survey found that, due to the
current climate of fear and uncertainty surrounding
the HPV vaccine, Japanese mothers are tending to put
off their daughters’ HPV vaccination, even when they
understand and accept its benefits. It is going to be
highly difficult to induce these mothers to inoculate
their daughters, even after the eventual restart of the
governmental
recommendation,
because
many
of
these mothers intend to wait for the vaccination of
many other girls before they will commit their own
daughters. For the most effective dissemination of the
HPV vaccine after a recommendation restart, vaccin-
ation of the daughters of the most willing mothers
will have to occur first, and the hope is that this will
spread to their friends and acquaintances.
Our survey of responses to our educational sheet,
which was developed and guided by behavioral eco-
nomics, demonstrated that it functioned effectively to
persuade mothers of low decision-making facility to
want to have their daughters vaccinated within a few
months of a recommendation restart (Table 6). During
these months, educational leaflets should be utilized to
reinforce this motivation. This stepped strategy should
be practiced in small scale trials in anticipation of a re-
start of the governmental recommendation.
It is hoped that the present study might provide a use-
ful HPV educational tool, not only for Japan, but also for
the many other countries where the HPV vaccination
rate is woefully insufficient.
