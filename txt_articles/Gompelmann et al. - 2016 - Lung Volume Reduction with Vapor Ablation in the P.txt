CV+ patients following BTVA and safety results summarized. 
 
Results: 
 78% (35/45) of the patients in the treatment arm 
and 79% (19/24) of the patients in the control arm were 
found to be CV+. At 12 months, the FEV 
1 improvement of the 
treatment arm was 9.2%, as compared with a decrease of 
5.4% in the control group, resulting in a mean between-
group difference of 14.6% ( 
p 
 = 0.0137). The improvement in 
SGRQ-C of the treatment arm as compared to the control 
arm was 8.4 points ( 
p = 0.0712). An increase in respiratory 
related serious adverse events was observed immediately 
following treatment, but most resolved with routine care. 
 
Conclusion: BTVA can achieve safe and clinically meaningful 
improvement in pulmonary function and quality of life in pa-
tients with CV. These randomized controlled trial subgroup 
results offer proof of a viable solution for CV+ patients.

Abstract 
 
Background: Emphysema patients with collateral ventila-
tion (CV) will not benefit from valve therapy, the most com-
mon endoscopic lung volume reduction procedure. A recent 
randomized controlled trial (STEP-UP) of the alternative 
bronchoscopic thermal vapor ablation (BTVA) included pa-
tients with (CV+) and without interlobar CV (CV–).  
Objec-
tives: This analysis evaluated the efficacy and safety of the 
CV+ population following BTVA.  
Method: A post hoc fissure 
analysis of the baseline computed tomography of all treat-
ment and control patients was performed with the VIDA Di-
agnostics Apollo software. A patient was considered to be 
CV+ if either of the treated upper lobes was adjacent to a 
fissure that was <90% complete. The primary endpoints,

Introduction 
 
Lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS) minimizes 
hyperinflation and has been demonstrated to improve 
quality of life and lung function in patients with severe 
emphysema  
[1] 
. However, as LVRS is associated with sig-
nificant morbidity and mortality, endoscopic approaches 
to lung volume reduction have been developed and stud-
ied. The most widespread of these is the endoscopic valve 
therapy that shows promising results, but only in patients 
without interlobar collateral ventilation (CV)  
[2–4] 
. 
Thereby, valves are placed in all segments of an emphy-
sematous lobe (lobar exclusion) and are designed to allow 
air to escape from the treated lobe but prevent air from 
entering the treated lobe during inspiration. When suc-
cessful, the lung parenchyma distal to the obstruction col-
lapses and becomes atelectatic, creating lung volume re-
duction  
[2, 3] 
. However, many patients have lungs with 
CV between lobes, which prevents the intended complete 
occlusion effect through maintenance of airflow via the 
collateral channels. Therefore, these patients with inter-
lobar CV (CV+) will not benefit from endoscopic valve 
therapy and have limited options for an effective endo-
scopic lung volume reduction (ELVR). 
 
Bronchoscopic thermal vapor ablation (BTVA) is a 
unique approach to ELVR that is capable of inducing vol-
ume reduction at the segmental level  
[5, 6] 
. Most patients 
have highly diseased and relatively healthy segments with-
in the same lobe  
[7] 
. Vapor is capable of reducing only the 
highly diseased segments while preserving the remaining 
segments because lobar exclusion is not necessary.
 
Interlobar fissure completeness is a surrogate for low 
CV and can be evaluated using the multidetector com-
puted tomography scan (MDCT). This parameter has 
never been a prerequisite for vapor ablation, and patients 
with incomplete fissures and CV have always been in-
cluded in previous studies  
[8, 9] 
. One retrospective study 
in a small patient cohort has already demonstrated that 
lobar fissure integrity (FI) has no or minimal influence on 
BTVA-induced volume reduction  
[10] 
.
 
The recent Sequential Staged Treatment of Emphyse-
ma with Upper Lobe Predominance (STEP-UP) trial was 
the first multinational, multicenter, randomized con-
trolled study to investigate the segmental approach of 
BTVA  
[5] 
. In this study, we present a post hoc analysis of 
STEP-UP treatment and control patients with incom-
plete fissures to evaluate the clinical outcomes of this 
CV+ subgroup only. Since these patients have few other 
safe and effective ELVR options, it is important to under-
stand the outcomes in this specific cohort.
 
Material and Methods 
 
Study Design and Participants 
 
Full details of the STEP-UP study design and results have been 
previously reported  
[5, 11, 12] 
. In brief, adult patients with upper 
lobe-predominant heterogeneous emphysema were enrolled from 
13 multinational hospital sites. Selection criteria were similar to 
other ELVR randomized controlled trials and the National Em-
physema Treatment Trial (NETT)  
[1, 13, 14] 
. The study was lim-
ited to patients with evidence of upper lobe-predominant hetero-
geneous emphysema (>15% difference in lung density between 
targeted upper lobe segment and its respective lower lobe)  
[5–7] 
. 
FI was not an inclusion or exclusion criterion. Patients who met all 
study criteria were randomly assigned 2: 
  
1 and received therapy
( 
n = 45) with InterVapor 
® (Uptake Medical, Seattle, WA, USA) or 
medical management ( 
n = 24). Patients in the treatment arm re-
ceived treatment of one segment in one upper lobe followed by 
treatment of one or two segments in the other upper lobe 90 days 
later in addition to standard medical management as previously 
published. Vapor ablation treatment induces lung volume reduc-
tion by the bronchoscopic delivery of heated water vapor through 
a catheter. An occlusion balloon at the tip of the catheter is inflat-
ed to occlude the target region and 3–10 s of water vapor is deliv-
ered depending on the mass and volume of the segment to be treat-
ed. Patients in the control group received standard medical man-
agement consistent with the Global Initiative for Chronic 
Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines  
[15] 
. In both study 
groups, the patients were followed for 12 months. All enrolled pa-
tients provided a completed written informed consent form that 
was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board or 
Ethics Committee of all participating hospital sites. All participat-
ing sites provided ethics consent and protocol approval. Primary 
endpoints were forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 
1 
) and health-
related quality of life assessed using the St. George’
s Respiratory 
Questionnaire (SGRQ-C) at 12 months. Safety was evaluated by 
comparing rates of serious adverse events (SAEs), including exac-
erbation, pneumonia, pneumothorax, hemoptysis, and death, be-
tween trial groups.
 
Evaluation of Fissure Integrity  
 
A priori analysis of baseline MDCT scans was performed to 
calculate segment mass, volume, and density for dosing and seg-
ment selection purposes. An additional post hoc 
  
analysis of FI 
assessment was performed on the same baseline MDCT scans for 
each treatment and control patient. FI was calculated with the 
same VIDA Diagnostics Apollo version 2.1 software by 2 VIDA 
CT core lab analysts. Each analyst independently performed an 
analysis and the average score was computed and used for this 
study. Since only upper lobes were treated, only the fissures ad-
jacent to the upper lobes were considered. These were the left 
oblique fissure (LOF) for the left and combination of right 
oblique fissure and horizontal fissure (ROHF) for the right. FI 
 
≥ 
90% complete has been previously shown in multiple studies to 
predict the response outcome in valve procedures, as an incom-
plete interlobar fissure is a surrogate for CV between lobes  
[2, 3 
13, 16–19] 
. In this study, a threshold of <90% complete was used 
to define incomplete fissures, and these lungs were assumed to 
have CV.

Statistical Analysis 
 
In this study, a subset of the original STEP-UP trial is consid-
ered, i.e., only treatment and control patients with incomplete fis-
sures in either lung (FI <90% for LOF or ROHF). The same effi-
cacy primary and secondary endpoints of the original STEP-UP 
trial for the treatment group are compared against the control 
group. A comparison of SAEs is also done. Between-group statisti-
cal comparisons for the post hoc subset analysis was performed 
with the same method as the original STEP-UP report. Analysis 
was done on the intention-to-treat population at 12 months. The 
Hochberg method was used to compensate for multiple compari-
sons resulting from 2 endpoints. If both primary endpoints (FEV 
1 
and SGRQ-C) reached clinical significance at the 0.05 level, or if 
either 1 of the 2 endpoints reached clinical significance at the 0.025 
level, it is considered a positive result. We computed  
p 
 values for 
discrete variables using Fisher’
s exact test and  
p 
 values for con-
tinuous variables using the two-sample  
t test.
 
Results 
 
In the treatment arm, 78% (35/45) of the patients were 
found to have 1 or more incomplete fissures adjacent to 
a treated lobe and were considered to be CV+. The LOF 
was incomplete in 38% and the ROHF in 76%. In the con-
trol arm, 79% (19/24) of the patients had 1 or more in-
complete fissures. In this group, the LOF was incomplete 
in 46% and the ROHF in 71% of the patients.
 
In patients with incomplete fissures, the treated pa-
tients demonstrated a significant ( 
p  
≤ 0.025) improve-
ment – compared to standard care – for at least 1 of the 
primary efficacy endpoints FEV 
1 
 and SGRQ-C at 12 
months, meeting the statistical criteria of the original 
study design. The mean difference in FEV 
1 between trial 
groups at 12 months was 14.6% (95% CI 2.5–26.7;  
p = 
0.0137;  
Fig. 1 
). The mean difference in SGRQ-C between 
trial groups at 12 months was –8.4 points (95% CI 1.1 to 
–17.9;  
p = 0.0712;  
Fig. 2 
). Over the 1-year period, the larg-
est improvement of FEV 
1 
 and SGRQ-C was observed at 
12 months after treatment.  
Table 1 shows the results for 
the primary efficacy endpoints and  
Table 2 
 for the sec-
ondary efficacy endpoints. A binary responder analysis 
was done to indicate the minimal clinically important dif-
ference in pulmonary function (FEV 
1  
≥ 
12%) or quality of 
life (SGRQ-C  
≤ 
–8 points). The proportion of this patient 
subgroup achieving a minimal clinically important differ-
ence from baseline in either endpoint at 12 months was 
62%.
 
 
SAEs were monitored in both trial groups as the pri-
mary safety endpoint. In this subgroup of CV+ patients, 
exacerbations and pneumonia 90 days posttreatment 1 
and 2 (180 days posttreatment 1) were more common in 
the treatment group than in the control group and most 
resolved with standard of care. In the treatment sub-
group, 8 (23%) patients had pneumonia or pneumonitis 
and 3 (9%) had COPD exacerbations requiring hospital 
admission within the 180-day timeframe after treatment 
1. No incidences of hemoptysis or pneumothorax requir-
ing intervention were observed. 
 
Overall, the procedure was well tolerated with routine 
hospital stay and recovery without intervention for all 
SAEs, with the exception of 2 (6%) patients. One (3%) 
patient died 84 days after treatment from complications

by the data and safety monitoring board and was judged 
to be possibly related to treatment. One patient had a 
pneumonia requiring an ICU stay; however, the patient 
did not necessitate invasive mechanical ventilation, and 
made a full recovery. There were no unanticipated SAEs 
related to vapor ablation during the course of the study.
 
There were no SAEs observed in the treatment sub-
group in the 181–365-day observation period. There were 
3 (16%) patients with respiratory SAEs in the control

an improvement in complication rate over baseline fol-
lowing vapor ablation. The occurrence of these respira-
tory SAEs is reported in  
Table 3 
.
 
Discussion 
 
It is well established that ELVR with occlusion by 
valves do not demonstrate significant or minimal clini-
cally important improvement in pulmonary function or 
quality of life in a population of patients with incomplete 
fissures or interlobar CV  
[2, 3, 13, 16–19] 
. For this reason, 
valves are not used in clinical practice in lungs with in-
complete fissures or CV. Therefore, there is a large por-
tion of the severe emphysema population that is unserved. 
 
For these CV+ patients, endoscopic coil therapy, poly-
meric lung volume reduction, and BTVA are examined 
 
[10, 20, 21] 
. Endoscopic coil therapy improves exercise 
capacity in patients with severe lung hyperinflation but of 
uncertain clinical importance  
[14] 
. To date, there are only 
few predictors for successful coil treatment leading to in-
sufficient patient selection and requiring further investi-
gation. For the polymeric lung volume reduction, only 
few data that demonstrate promising efficacy results are 
available, as this technique has not been available on the 
market since 2013  
[22] 
. Furthermore, there are no ran-
domized controlled trial data demonstrating clinically 
meaningful improvement following coil therapy or poly-
meric lung volume reduction in this CV+ patient popula-
tion.
 
In the multinational, multicenter randomized con-
trolled STEP-UP trial of vapor ablation, fissure incom-
pleteness or CV+ status was not a contraindication. In 
this post hoc analysis, it was found that 78% of the treated 
patients had incomplete fissures (<90% complete) adja-
cent to 1 or both of the treated lobes. This high percentage 
of patients with interlobar CV is similar compared to the 
results of other investigations  
[4] 
.
 
The results of this study of the STEP-UP subgroup 
with incomplete fissures showed that significant and clin-
ically important difference improvement in FEV 
1 and 
quality of life occurs after vapor ablation despite the pres-
ence of CV. Compared with standard care, the primary 
endpoint of FEV 
1 and the SGRQ-C total score were im-
proved at 12 months in this subgroup ( 
p 
 = 0.0137 and 
0.0712) and considered as statistically significant positive 
result using the Hochberg method. These results were 
similar to the efficacy data of the total patient cohort in-
cluding CV– patients  
[12] 
. Notwithstanding the FI, the 
mean difference in FEV 
1 between all treated patients and 
all patients of the control group was 12.8%, and in SGRQ-
C, it was –12.1 points at 12 months (both  
p < 0.05).
 
The STEP-UP CV+ study results are consistent with 
data of another retrospective analysis of a multicenter 
single arm trial, where 44 patients with upper lobe pre-
dominant emphysema were treated unilaterally by BTVA 
 
[10] 
. In that patient cohort, 86% of the patients had in-
completeness in the relevant fissure. There was no or only 
minimal relationship between the FI and lung function 
parameters, 6-min walk distance (6-MWD) and SGRQ 
following BTVA. In this first trial, a vapor ablation was 
performed on a lobar level in comparison to the stepwise 
segmental approach in the current analysis. The aim of 
the subsequent vapor ablation on a sublobar basis is to 
target only the most diseased segments while the health-
ier segments should be preserved. Furthermore, the step-
wise strategy aims to improve the risk-benefit profile.

Thus, the current analysis demonstrated that this new 
segmental vapor ablation can benefit CV+ patients with 
upper lobe predominant emphysema.
 
SAEs were monitored in both CV+ control and treat-
ment groups as the primary safety endpoint. An increase 
in the occurrence of SAEs in the period immediately fol-
lowing treatment is expected and is common in other 
published ELVR randomized controlled trials. All ad-
verse events that occurred in this subgroup were man-
aged with standard medical care with the exception of 1 
patient that died and another that required a nonmechan-
ical ventilation ICU stay for pneumonia. No pneumotho-
rax requiring intervention or hemoptysis was observed.
 
 
The main limitation of this study is that it was not part 
of the a priori clinical investigation plan. However, the 
subgroup studied is a large majority of the full cohort and 
statistical significance remains strong. Other limitations 
are the same as the original STEP-UP study. While the 
investigators, patients, and sponsor were blinded to com-
piled summary statistics, a full double-blinded study was 
not feasible as the treatment effect is usually apparent on 
imaging and it would require a sham procedure of the 
control group, which was not possible due to ethical con-
cerns.
 
Emphysema has no known cure and patients progres-
sively lose pulmonary function over time. The strategy of 
reducing the most diseased segments with vapor ablation 
and preserving less diseased segments, safely and posi-
tively affects lung function and quality of life even in CV+ 
patients. Vapor ablation is unique in its ability to address 
this large population of CV+ patients as well as the poten-
tial to deliver additional treatment over time as the dis-
ease inevitably progresses.
