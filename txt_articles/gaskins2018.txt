Context: Marine long-chain omega-3 fatty acids have been positively related to markers of 
fecundity in both men and women. However, seafood, their primary food source, can also be a 
source of toxicants, which may counteract the reproductive benefits. 
Objective: To examine the relationship of male and female seafood intake with time to 
pregnancy (TTP). 
Design: Our prospective cohort study included 501 couples planning pregnancy who participated 
in the Longitudinal Investigation of Fertility and the Environment Study (2005-2009) and were 
followed for up to1 year or until pregnancy was detected. Seafood intake was collected daily 
during follow-up in journals.  
Setting: Couples residing in Michigan and Texas were recruited using population-based 
sampling frameworks. 
Main Outcome Measures. The primary outcome was time to pregnancy as determined by an in-
home pregnancy test. A secondary outcome was sexual intercourse frequency (SIF) as recorded 
in daily journals.  
Results: Couples where the male and female partners consumed ≥8 seafood servings/cycle had 
47% (95% CI 7, 103%) and 60% (95% CI 15, 122%) higher fecundity (shorter TTP) compared 
to couples with male and female partners who consumed ≤1 seafood serving/cycle, respectively. 
Couples in which both partners consumed ≥8 seafood servings/cycle had 61% (95% CI 17, 
122%) higher fecundity compared to couples consuming less. Male and female partners with the 
highest seafood intake (≥8 servings/cycle) also had 22% higher SIF. 
Conclusions: Higher male and female seafood intake was associated with higher frequency of 
sexual intercourse and fecundity among a large prospective cohort of couples attempting 
pregnancy.  
In this prospective cohort study with preconception enrollment and daily follow-up of couples, seafood 
intake in both partners was associated with higher frequency of sexual intercourse and fecundity. 
Introduction. 
 
Infertility, the failure to achieve pregnancy after 12 months of unprotected sexual 
intercourse, affects 15-25% of couples (1,2). While infertility treatments exist, their costs (3), 
limited geographical accessibility (4), and modest success (5) justify identifying modifiable

factors that increase a couple’s chance of conceiving without medical assistance. Seafood is a 
recommended component of many healthy eating patterns (6,7). In the context of fertility, 
however, seafood has largely been studied as a potential harm representing a primary source of 
exposure to reproductive toxicants such as organochlorines, dioxins, and mercury (8-11). 
However, some studies have found reproductive benefits with higher marine long-chain omega 3 
fatty acid intake, such as increased progesterone levels, shorter time to pregnancy, and better 
semen quality (12-14).  
For the average U.S. adult, the current recommendation is to eat at least two seafood servings 
per week (6); however in January 2017, the US Food and Drug Administration and 
Environmental Protection Agency recommended that women who are pregnant or may become 
pregnant eat no more than 3 servings per week (15); This guideline was established to limit fetal 
methyl-mercury exposure, which has been linked to adverse neurocognitive consequences. Yet, 
to our knowledge, these guidelines did not consider potential reproductive benefits of seafood 
intake. To address this gap, we used data from a prospective cohort of couples trying to become 
pregnant, where information on daily seafood intake and sexual intercourse was collected in 
journals, to investigate whether male and female seafood intake was associated with time to 
pregnancy and whether this association could be due to differences in sexual activity. 
Materials and Methods. 
The Longitudinal Investigation of Fertility and the Environment (LIFE) Study is a prospective 
cohort of 501 couples attempting to conceive in two geographic areas (Texas and Michigan) 
between 2005 and 2009. Using population-based sampling frameworks, households were 
contacted to identify eligible couples in a committed relationship. Female partners were 18 to 44 
years, had menstrual cycles between 21 and 42 days, and had no hormonal birth control 
injections during past year. Male partners were ≥18 years. Both partners had the ability to 
communicate in English or Spanish and had no sterilization procedures or physician diagnosed 
infertility. Couples were further excluded if they had been off contraception >2 months. A 
complete description of the study’s methods is presented elsewhere (16). Briefly, of the 1188 
eligible couples, 501 (42%) enrolled in the study and were followed for up to 12 months, with 
monthly pregnancy tests. The protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Boards at each 
institution. All participants provided written informed consent. 
Research assistants traveled to couples’ homes and completed baseline in-person interviews 
separately with each partner. Both partners were asked how often over the past 12 months they 
ate canned tuna fish; fish caught in unknown locations; crab, shrimp, or other shellfish caught in 
an unknown location; fish caught in local waters; and crab, shrimp, or shellfish caught in local 
waters. The 5 response options ranged from “never or almost never” to “two or more times per 
week”. The selected frequency category for each seafood item was then converted to a monthly 
intake and then all items were summed to get the total baseline seafood intake. On the daily 
journals, male and female participants were asked to report the number of 4 oz. servings of fish 
or shellfish consumed. These daily responses were then summed across the cycle to get their 
cycle-specific seafood intake. For analysis, baseline and daily male and female seafood intake 
were classified into categories that approximated quartiles. 
During the enrollment interview, each partner reported their age, level of education, 
ethnicity, race, household income, and use of cigarettes. Participants were asked whether they 
followed a regular vigorous exercise program in the past 12 months and if so, how many days 
per week. The 4-item Cohen's perceived stress scale (PSS-4) was also administered (17). Men

and women reported whether they had consumed ≥12 alcoholic drinks in the past year and if so, 
how often they consumed alcoholic beverages. All participants had their weight and height 
measured using standardized procedures and BMI was calculated as weight (kg) divided by 
height squared (m2). 
The primary outcome was fecundity as measured by time to pregnancy (TTP). We used daily 
journal information supplemented with fertility monitors to define menstrual cycles, defined as 
the interval (in days) from the onset of bleeding that increased in intensity and lasted ≥2 days to 
the onset of the next similar bleeding episode. Since couples were allowed to enroll in LIFE mid-
cycle, we defined this as cycle 0 to differentiate it from cycle 1, which denotes the first fully 
observed menstrual cycle. Pregnancy was defined as a positive study-provided home pregnancy 
test, which was sensitive for 25 mIU/ml hCG. A secondary outcome was frequency of vaginal-
penial intercourse as collected by the men and women in their daily journals. For each cycle of 
follow-up, sexual intercourse frequency (SIF) reports were summed across all days to get the 
total SIF per cycle. The correlation between the frequency of sexual intercourse per cycle as 
reported by the male and female partner was 0.98 and the average difference between the two 
reports was -0.02 times per month. Due to the slightly lower amount of missing data in the 
female diaries, female report of SIF was used as the main outcome variable. 
We classified each partner into high (≥9 times/month, the 75th percentile) or low-to-average 
seafood intake (<9 times/month). Male and female demographic and lifestyle characteristics 
were then compared using analysis of variance for continuous variables or chi-square tests for 
categorical variables. The correlation within and between male and female seafood intake at 
baseline and during follow-up was calculated using spearman correlation coefficients.  
Cox proportional odds models for discrete survival data accounting for left truncation (to 
account for time off contraception before enrollment) and right censoring (to account for loss to 
follow-up or end of study) were used to estimate fecundability odds ratios (FORs), and their 95% 
CIs, as a measure of fecundity. FORs represent the relative odds of achieving pregnancy 
conditional on not becoming pregnant in the previous cycle, where FOR less than 1 indicates 
diminished fecundity as measured by a longer TTP. Seafood intake was initially considered as 
quartiles of intake and in a supplementary analysis it was modeled continuously using linear and 
quadratic terms. 
To analyze the association between seafood intake and SIF per cycle over follow-up, we used 
generalized linear mixed models with Poisson distribution. Effect estimates and 95% CIs are 
presented as the percent difference in SIF for a particular group as compared to the reference 
group. We also explored the association between day-level seafood intake and SIF using a 
generalized linear mixed model with logit link and present the results as the odds ratio (95% CI) 
of sexual intercourse in a given day. We imputed SIF values for cycles with >50% of days 
missing information on SIF and any cycles with <14 days of follow-up (n=159 cycles) using 
Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods (PROC MI in SAS) with 5 multiple imputations based on 
menstrual cycle length, cycle number of follow-up, female age, the difference between couple’s 
ages, female race and education level, and male exercise. Effect estimates from models using 
multiply imputed values for SIF were estimated using Rubin’s formula for combining estimates 
across imputations (PROC MIANALYZE in SAS). 
Confounding was evaluated using prior knowledge and descriptive statistics from our cohort 
through the use of directed acyclic graphs. Variables retained in the final multivariable models 
were female age (years), the difference between couple’s ages (years), female race (non-Hispanic 
white vs. other), male exercise (yes vs. no), and male and female alcohol intake (≥1 times/week

vs. <1 time/week). Additional models were run further adjusting for male and female partner 
seafood intake due to the high amount of concordance within a couple. The fecundity models 
were also further adjusted for SIF to evaluate the extent to which this variable explained any 
observed associations. A p-value for trend was calculated across categories of seafood intake 
using the median intake level in each category as a continuous variable. 
In the main analysis, missing data on seafood intake in the daily journals was considered as 
no intake, as is common in dietary analyses. Sensitivity analyses were performed where missing 
seafood intake was imputed for cycles that were missing 100% and >50% of days of seafood 
intake data using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods with 5 multiple imputations and Rubin’s 
formula for combining estimates across imputations. To address concerns of residual 
confounding, we also calculated propensity scores and ran the final model adjusting for this 
variable and stratified by quintiles of this variable. To quantify the impact of unmeasured 
confounding, we calculated the e-value, which estimates the minimum strength of association 
that an unmeasured confounder would need to have with both the exposure and outcome to fully 
explain a specific exposure–outcome association (18). SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, 
USA) was used for all statistical analyses. 
Results. 
Male partners who reported the highest usual seafood intake were less likely to have a non-
Hispanic white partner and more likely to exercise regularly and consume alcohol ≥1 time/week 
compared to men with lower intake (Table 1). Female partners with the highest usual seafood 
intake were, on average, older, had older partners, were less likely to be non-Hispanic white, and 
were more likely to consume alcohol ≥1 time/week than females with the lower intake. Seafood 
intake was not associated with BMI, education level of either partner, or household income. 
Male and female seafood intakes within a couple were moderately correlated at baseline (r=0.46) 
and highly correlated during follow-up (r=0.70) (Table S1). Within men and women, baseline 
seafood intakes were moderately correlated with intakes during follow-up (r=0.47 and 0.53, 
respectively). 
Higher male (but not female) baseline seafood intake was associated with higher SIF during 
follow-up after multivariable adjustment (Table 2). Men who usually consumed seafood ≥9 
times/month had 22.9% (95% CI 6.8, 41.5%) higher SIF compared to men who usually 
consumed seafood ≤2 times/month (p-trend=0.007). There was a positive association between 
baseline female seafood intake and SIF that became attenuated after adjustment for male partner 
intake. During follow-up, both male and female seafood intake was independently associated 
with SIF with slightly stronger associations observed for male intake. Furthermore, when both 
partners consumed ≥8 servings/cycle, SIF was increased by 21.9% (95% CI 15.2, 29.0) 
compared to couples consuming less. In day-level analyses, the odds of sexual intercourse was 
39% (95% CI 29, 50%) higher if both partners consumed seafood the same day, 3% (-5, 11%) 
higher if only the female consumed seafood, and 2% (-6, 10%) higher if only the male consumed 
seafood compared to couples where neither partner consumed seafood. Associations were 
identical when the male report of SIF was used (instead of the female report). 
Baseline seafood intake was not associated with fecundity after multivariable adjustment 
(Table S2). There were also no differences in the associations according to whether the seafood 
was caught in local versus unknown waters or whether the seafood was shellfish versus fish (data 
not shown). On the other hand, prospectively collected male and female seafood intake from the 
daily journals was related to increased fecundity (shorter TTP) (Table 3). Specifically, men and

women who consumed ≥8 seafood servings/cycle had 47% (95% CI 7, 103%) and 60% (95% CI 
15, 122) higher fecundity compared to men and women who consumed ≤1 seafood serving/cycle 
after multivariable adjustment. These associations were attenuated with further adjustment for 
partner seafood intake (Model 2) most likely due the high correlation between intakes over 
follow-up. When modeling intake as a continuous variable, both male and female seafood intake 
was associated with higher fecundity plateauing around 14-16 seafood servings per cycle (>90th 
percentile of intake) (Figure S1). 
The positive association between seafood intake and fecundity was stronger among couples 
where both partners consumed high amounts of seafood during follow-up (Figure 1). On 
average, the estimated percentages of couples who were pregnant by 6 and 12 months among 
couples who consumed ≥8 seafood servings/cycle were 81% and 92% compared to 64% and 
79% among couples consuming less. This translated into an adjusted FOR of 1.61 (95% CI 1.17, 
2.22) (Table S3) and a 13% lower absolute difference in incidence of infertility. The positive 
associations between male, female, and couple seafood intake and fecundity were slightly 
attenuated after adjustment for SIF; however, the FORs for the highest female and couple 
seafood consumers remained statistically significant. 
In sensitivity analyses aimed at testing our assumption that days missing seafood intake in 
the journals represented days with zero seafood intake, the associations between male, female, 
and couple daily journal seafood intake and fecundity were attenuated but still positively related 
to fecundity (Table S4). The association between higher seafood intake in both partners and time 
to pregnancy was also robust in the sensitivity analyses with further adjustment and stratification 
by propensity score (Table S5). Finally, the unmeasured confounding analyses showed that the 
observed FOR of 1.61 could only be explained away by an unmeasured confounder that was 
associated with both the exposure and the outcome by a risk ratio of 2.13-fold or higher, above 
and beyond the measured confounders. 
Discussion. 
  
In this prospective cohort study with preconception enrollment and daily follow-up of 
couples, seafood intake in both partners was associated with higher frequency of sexual 
intercourse and fecundity. Specifically, the daily odds of sexual intercourse were 39% higher 
when both partners consumed seafood on the same day and couples where both partners 
consumed ≥8 seafood servings per cycle had 61% higher fecundity and 13% lower absolute 
difference in incidence of infertility compared to couples consuming less seafood. 
The literature on seafood intake and TTP while sparse is conflicting (19,20). There are 
several reasons for this heterogeneity including differences in study designs, the primary sources, 
types, and range of seafood consumed, and outcome assessment. Of brief note, both previous 
studies have relied on a retrospective report of seafood intake, which could have introduced 
substantial measurement error. Our study illustrates this point well as we found no associations 
between baseline seafood intake, assessed using a typical retrospective questionnaire, and 
fecundity despite moderate positive correlations with prospectively collected intake. Insufficient 
power could also be an issue. A retrospective cohort study from Sweden found no differences in 
TTP comparing women differentially exposed to fatty fish contaminated with persistent 
organochlorines. However, within each group, the consumption of locally caught fatty fish had a 
marginally significant, positive relation with fecundity (success odds ratio=1.27 [95% CI 0.96, 
1.69] and 1.36 [95% CI 0.96, 1.94]) (20).

Only one study has found a detrimental impact of female seafood intake on fecundity. This 
retrospective TTP study of recently pregnant female anglers found that women who consumed 
≥1 fish meal per month from Lake Ontario (a highly contaminated source of fish) had reduced 
fecundity (FR: 0.73 [95% CI 0.54, 0.98]). There were no associations between male partner 
intake and TTP (19). Of note, a previous publication from this cohort found inverse relations 
between select male and female serum organochlorines and dioxins and fecundity (21) and no 
associations with blood mercury concentrations and TTP (22); suggesting that the fertility 
benefits of seafood consumption may outweigh the potential harms of environmental pollutants 
carried by these foods. In agreement with our findings, a recent prospective study found that 
among U.S. women trying to get pregnant who did not use fish oil supplements, intake of omega 
3 fatty acids, a primary nutrient found in seafood, was associated with higher fecundity (FR=1.40 
[95% CI 1.13, 1.73] for Q4 vs. Q1) (12). Similarly, in a prospective cohort study of women 
undergoing infertility treatment with assisted reproductive technologies, higher serum levels and 
intake of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids were associated with a higher probability of achieving 
pregnancy and live birth (23).  
We observed a positive association between seafood intake and SIF, supporting popular 
beliefs of the aphrodisiac properties of seafood. This association did not completely explain the 
relationship with fecundity, suggesting that the effects of seafood could be due to mechanisms 
other than increased sexual activity. Several studies have found positive associations between 
omega fatty acid intake (24,25), seafood intake (26,27), and dietary patterns prioritizing seafood 
intake (28-31) and semen quality parameters, lending support to the idea that higher seafood 
intake could increase the quantity and quality of sperm. Among women, dietary intake of 
docosapentaenoic acid was associated with a lower risk of anovulation and dietary intake of total 
marine omega-3 polyunsaturated fats was associated with increased luteal-phase progesterone 
concentrations (13), suggesting beneficial effects of seafood on ovulation and menstrual cycle 
function. Finally, two separate infertility cohort studies have shown that embryo quality 
measures were improved among women with higher fish (32) and docosahexaenoic acid intake 
(33), supporting a favorable role of seafood intake on early embryo development.  
While these previous studies support our findings that the seafood intake may promote 
fecundity through various biological mechanisms, it is important to consider alternate 
explanations. First, individuals with higher seafood intakes could have healthier diets overall, 
which we were unable to account for in this study. However, the estimated e-value of 2.13 
decreases the likelihood of this explanation. While it is conceivable that unmeasured dietary 
factors are associated with seafood intake by a risk ratio of >2.13-fold, we are unaware of any 
studies linking any specific dietary or lifestyle factors to fecundity by a risk ratio (or FOR) 
>2.13-fold. For context, the FOR comparing women <27y to ≥35y in this cohort was 1.96. Thus, 
while residual confounding is possible, it is unlikely to explain the entire association. Second, 
couples who consume higher amounts of seafood together share more meals and thus more time 
together (including nights) which may explain the association with sexual activity and 
subsequently fecundity. However, after we adjusted for SIF in our models, the association 
between seafood intake and fecundity remained, suggesting that this behavioral pathway did not 
completely explain the association. 
Our study had other limitations. First, it consisted solely of couples planning pregnancy 
without medical assistance. All couples were also given fertility monitors to help time 
intercourse relative to ovulation and instructed to use them throughout follow-up. Since women 
using fertility monitors are more likely to get pregnant within two cycles than those who do not

use a monitor (34), our results might not generalize to all women of reproductive age. However, 
the use of fertility monitors in our study is also a strength as it removed any confounding by use 
of this or similar devices. We were able to assess differences in type (shellfish versus fish) and 
source (local versus unknown waters) of seafood using the baseline assessment tool –and did not 
find any differences. Yet, we did not collect these details during follow-up, which limited our 
ability to distinguish between specific types of seafood and their potential reproductive effects. 
Finally, while it would have been ideal to include an assessment of daily diet, this was not 
feasible given the high participant burden of daily 24-hour recalls and therefore residual 
confounding by other dietary factors, including dietary supplements, is possible, although 
unlikely to explain the entire association as discussed above. 
Our study had multiple strengths including the gold-standard assessment of time to 
pregnancy through the prospective use of fertility monitors and daily journals combined with in-
home pregnancy testing. In addition, we had daily, prospective assessment of seafood intake. We 
were also able to reduce the likelihood of residual confounding by adjusting for many 
demographic and lifestyle factors. Due to our sampling frameworks, which in Texas used the 
Parks and Wildlife Department's angler database for recruitment and in Michigan used a 
commercially available marketing database with recruitment filters to identify individuals with 
fishing interests, we were also able to study a unique population where seafood intake was not 
tightly correlated with socioeconomic status. Moreover, despite the over recruitment of anglers, 
the average seafood intake of our cohort was very similar to that of men and women from a 
representative US sample (35). Our population was also recruited due to presumed exposure to 
persistent environmental chemicals which have been linked to fecundity impairments (36). Thus, 
it is possible that our results regarding seafood consumption would be even stronger in a 
population unexposed to sources of seafood contamination. Finally, by including the male 
partners we were able to evaluate the separate and joint effects of male and female seafood 
consumption, which is rare in fecundity studies. 
In sum, couples in which both partners consumed ≥8 seafood servings/cycle, or 
approximately ≥2 seafood servings per week, had significantly higher frequency of sexual 
intercourse and higher fecundity. These findings highlight the importance of a couples’ diet for 
fecundity and the need for appropriate preconception guidance. Future research is needed that 
specifically evaluates the potential harms associated with predatory fish intake, which tends to 
contain higher levels of persistent environmental chemicals and mercury.
