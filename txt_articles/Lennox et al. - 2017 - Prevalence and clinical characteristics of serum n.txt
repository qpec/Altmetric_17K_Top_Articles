Summary
Background—Psychosis is a common presenting feature in antibody-mediated encephalitis, for 
which prompt recognition and treatment usually leads to remission. We aimed to investigate 
whether people with circumscribed schizophrenia-like illnesses have such antibodies—especially 
antibodies against the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)—more commonly than do 
healthy controls.
Methods—We recruited patients aged 14–35 years presenting to any of 35 mental health services 
sites across England with first-episode psychosis, less than 6 weeks of treatment with 
antipsychotic medication, and a score of 4 or more on at least one selected Positive and Negative 
Syndrome Scale (PANSS) item. Patients and controls provided venous blood samples. We 
completed standardised symptom rating scales (PANSS, ACE-III, GAF) at baseline, and tested 
serum samples for antibodies against NMDAR, LGI1, CASPR2, the GABAA receptor, and the 
AMPA receptor using live cell-based assays. Treating clinicians assessed outcomes of ICD 
diagnosis and functioning (GAF) at 6 months. We included healthy controls from the general 
population, recruited as part of another study in Cambridge, UK.
Findings—Between Feb 1, 2013, and Aug 31, 2014, we enrolled 228 patients with first-episode 
psychosis and 105 healthy controls. 20 (9%) of 228 patients had serum antibodies against one or 
more of the neuronal cell surface antibodies compared with four (4%) of 105 controls (unadjusted 
odds ratio 2·4, 95% CI 0·8–7·3). These associations remained non-significant when adjusted for 
current cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, and illicit drug use. Seven (3%) patients had 
NMDAR antibodies compared with no controls (p=0·0204). The other antibodies did not differ 
between groups. Antibody-positive patients had lower PANSS positive, PANSS total, and catatonia 
scores than did antibody-negative patients. Patients had comparable scores on other PANSS items, 
ACE-III, and GAF at baseline, with no difference in outcomes at 6 months.
Interpretation—Some patients with first-episode psychosis had antibodies against NMDAR that 
might be relevant to their illness, but did not differ from patients without NMDAR antibodies in 
clinical characteristics. Our study suggests that the only way to detect patients with these 
potentially pathogenic antibodies is to screen all patients with first-episode psychosis at first 
presentation.

Introduction
Autoantibodies to neuronal cell surface receptors and related proteins have been described in 
association with encephalitic syndromes that frequently include psychiatric symptoms—
usually psychosis—as a prominent part of the phenotype. Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate 
receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis, first described in 2007,1 is the most common of these. It is 
a multistage encephalitis caused by antibodies to the GluN1 (NR1) subunit of the NMDAR. 
NMDAR encephalitis presents initially with psychiatric symptoms in more than two thirds 
of patients before recognition of neurological symptoms including cognitive deficits, 
seizures, autonomic instability, and movement disorder.2
Several autoimmune encephalitides have been identified associated with autoantibodies to 
other cell surface antigens, including leucine-rich glioma inactivated 1 (LGI1),3 contactin 
associated protein 2 (CASPR2),3 the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionic 
acid receptor (AMPAR),4 and the γ-aminobutyric-acid receptor (GABAAR).5 Psychiatric or 
behavioural manifestations are commonly described, and occasional cases of patients with 
purely psychiatric presentations with these antibodies have been reported.5,6
In autoimmune encephalitis associated with voltage-gated potassium channel (VGKC)-
complex antibodies, the antibodies are usually directed against the neuronal surface antigens 
LGI1 and CASPR2, which are components of the VGKC-complex; these antibodies are 
thought to be pathogenic.3 In other cases, the VGKC-complex antibodies do not bind to 
LGI1 or CASPR2,7,8 and might bind to intracellular, non-pathogenic epitopes on the 
VGKC-complex; these antibodies, therefore, are unlikely to be causative. However, one 
study8 in children suggested that these antibodies might be a marker for immune-responsive 
neuroinflammatory conditions.
For these encephalitides, early treatment with first-line (eg, steroids, plasmapheresis, or 
intravenous immunoglobulins) or second-line (eg, rituximab or cyclophosphamide) 
immunotherapy is generally associated with good outcome, and many patients are able to 
return to a premorbid status.9,10 Recognition that these encephalitic syndromes can cause 
psychosis before development of other symptoms has led to considerable interest as to 
whether these IgG autoantibodies are associated with psychotic symptoms without the 
emergence of other features of encephalitis in patients presenting to psychiatric services.
In 2010, we identified serum antibodies to the NMDAR or VGKC-complex in three (6·5%) 
of 46 patients presenting to a first-episode psychosis service.11 A systematic review and 
meta-analysis12 showed an odds ratio (OR) of 3·1 (95% CI 1·04–9·27) for serum NMDAR 
IgG antibody positivity in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, bipolar 
affective disorder, or major depressive disorder compared with controls, and a later study13 
of serum NMDAR antibodies in children has supported this finding. However, these studies 
have considerable heterogeneity in terms of diagnosis, duration of illness, and assay method 
used for detection of antibodies, and some large case-control studies14–16 have found no 
difference between patients with psychosis and controls in rates of NMDAR, LGI1, or

 CASPR216 antibodies in serum. These studies also did not distinguish between antibody 
subtype (IgG, A, or M).
In this study we aimed to provide an improved estimate of the prevalence of NMDAR and 
other disease-relevant neuronal cell surface antibodies in the serum of patients with first-
episode psychosis, compared with a group of healthy controls with similar age, sex, and 
ethnicity characteristics. Given the association between autoantibody-mediated CNS disease 
and cognitive impairment,17,18 and to investigate further the possibility that autoantibody 
positivity might delineate a distinct phenotypic subgroup of patients with psychosis, we also 
aimed to characterise the clinical and cognitive profile of our participants. We measured 
antibodies in serum rather than in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) both to align with clinical 
practice in the UK, and because antibodies are detected at a higher rate in serum than in CSF 
for encephalitis, especially early in the course of illness.2
Although some evidence suggests that non-IgG antibodies (ie, IgM, IgA) might have 
pathogenic potential within the CNS,19 these antibodies are very uncommonly detected with 
live cell assays (AV, LJ; unpublished data) and the study was restricted to IgG antibodies.
Methods
Study design and participants
For identification of cases, 35 early intervention, community, or inpatient mental health 
services sites across England recruited patients between Feb 1, 2013, and Aug 31, 2014, 
experiencing a first episode of psychosis. Inclusion criteria comprised age 14–35 years 
inclusive, less than 6 weeks on antipsychotic medication, and a score of 4 or more on at least 
one of the following Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)20 positive items: 
delusions, hallucinations, grandiosity, or suspiciousness, or on unusual thought content 
(PANSS general item). Exclusion criteria were suspected drug-induced psychosis or the 
presence of neurological disorder (eg, head injury, multiple sclerosis). The East of England 
(Norfolk) Local Research Ethics Committee approved the patient study, reference 12/EE/
0307.
Control participants were recruited from the general population in Cambridge, UK as part of 
a separate study (Local Research Ethics Committee reference 08/H0308/5).21 The number 
of controls was therefore limited by the original study. Inclusion criteria included age older 
than 16 years, with no personal or family history of mental illness. The control sample was 
similar in age, sex, and ethnicity to a typical sample of patients with first-episode psychosis. 
Written informed consent was obtained from every participant to use samples in future 
studies.
Procedures
Patients were assessed by research assistants local to the centres at a single baseline 
assessment session with the following clinical measures: psychotic symptoms (PANSS20 
with positive, negative, and general psychopathology symptom sub-scores); general level of 
functioning for people with psychiatric disorders (Global Assessment of Functioning

 [GAF]);22 catatonic symptoms (Bush-Francis Catatonia Rating Scale);23 and brief 
cognitive assessment (Addenbrooke’s Cognitive Examination-III [ACE-III]).24
We assessed PANSS rating concordance by asking research assistants involved in data 
collection to rate a standardised video of a PANSS interview. Inter-rater reliability was good, 
with each research assistant score within 1 SD of the mean. 6-month outcomes were 
assessed from notes by treating clinicians through a case report form at 6 months, including 
GAF and illness course.
All patients and controls gave a venous blood sample; patient samples were taken at initial 
clinical assessment, and control samples were taken after consent in the original study.21
BL, LJ, HF, BF, and AV did autoantibody testing in the neuroimmunology laboratory at John 
Radcliffe Hospital (Oxford, UK) using assays in routine clinical use.2,25 We used a live 
cell-based assay for the detection of IgG antibodies binding to the NMDAR NR1/NR2b 
subunits, the VGKC-complex-associated proteins LGI1 and CASPR2, α1 and γ2 subunits of 
GABAAR, and AMPAR, as described elsewhere.3,5,25 Binding to the cell membrane was 
scored by fluorescence microscopy, with a visual score ranging from 0 to 4.2 The titre of 
each antibody was given as the dilution of serum providing a score of 1. All assays were 
repeated and checked for IgG specificity—as per routine diagnosis—and scored separately 
and masked to diagnosis on each occasion.
We measured VGKC-complex antibodies using a radio-immunoprecipitation assay of 
VGKC-complex proteins labelled with 125I-α-dendrotoxin and precipitated with patient 
serum samples.25 We measured antinuclear antibodies by direct immunofluorescence as an 
additional test of autoimmunity.
Statistical analysis
We calculated a sample size of 235 patients to replicate the prevalence of 6·5% found in our 
pilot study11 while refining the OR estimation to be greater than 5%, thus providing a closer 
estimation of the prevalence of the disorder. We used t tests to compare continuous data and 
χ2 tests to compare categorical demographic and lifestyle variables in patients with first-
episode psychosis and controls. We used χ2 tests and ORs (unadjusted and adjusted for 
smoking, alcohol, and illicit drug use) to compare the prevalence of antibodies in patients 
and controls. We used likelihood ratios (unadjusted) to compare the prevalence of NMDAR 
and LGI1, because ORs could not be calculated owing to null values in the control group.
We used χ2 tests and t tests (or Mann-Whitney U tests with non-normally distributed data) 
to test for associations between clinical and cognitive test variables and antibody status in 
patients with first-episode psychosis. We set significance level for all analyses at p=0·05. We 
analysed data using SPSS version 22.

 Results
Between Feb 1, 2013, and Aug 31, 2014, 235 patients with first-episode psychosis consented 
to be included in the study. Two patients were excluded after assessment as they did not 
meet the inclusion criteria, and five patients withdrew their data and samples. 228 patients 
had serum collected and were included in the study for analysis. These patients and 105 
healthy controls were similar in age, sex, and ethnic origin (table 1). The youngest patient 
was aged 16 years. Patients were more likely to be current cigarette smokers or current users 
of illicit drugs than were controls, whereas control participants were more likely to be 
current alcohol drinkers (defined as having consumed alcohol in the previous month).
On antibody testing, 20 (9%) patients with first-episode psychosis were positive for any one 
neuronal cell surface antibody compared with four (4%) controls (table 2), but this 
difference was not significant. Serum NMDAR antibodies were more prevalent in patients 
(seven cases [3%]) than in controls (none). VGKC-complex antibodies were present in 11 
(5%) patients and three (3%) controls (p=0·38). One patient was positive for both NMDAR 
and VGKC-complex antibodies. Patients and controls did not differ in the presence of serum 
antibodies against LGI1, CASPR2, or GABAAR. No patients or controls had AMPAR 
antibodies. Overall, titres of participants with positive antibodies were low. No participants 
with VGKC-complex antibodies had antibodies against LGI1 or CASPR2. No patients with 
neuronal antibodies had antinuclear antibodies, and no significant difference was found in 
antinuclear antibodies between the two populations (table 2). Because the patient and control 
groups differed in rates of alcohol use, cigarette smoking, and illicit drug use, adjusted ORs 
were calculated and group differences remained non-significant.
For patients with first-episode psychosis, the neuronal cell surface antibody-positive (n=20) 
and antibody-negative (n=208) groups were compared on assessments of clinical and 
cognitive symptoms (table 3). Both groups had levels of psychotic symptoms that indicated a 
moderate level of illness (PANSS total 69·0–77·6), with antibody-positive patients having 
lower mean PANSS positive scores and mean PANSS total scores than did antibody-negative 
patients (table 3). Both groups had low levels of catatonia symptoms, with antibody-positive 
patients having lower mean total scores than did antibody-negative patients. Both antibody-
positive and antibody-negative patients had impairment in their cognitive functioning and 
were moderately functionally impaired with mean GAF scores of around 50, but with no 
significant differences in these parameters between groups (table 3).
Patients positive for autoantibodies were followed up 6 months after baseline assessment to 
investigate clinical course and outcome. We found no significant difference in the number of 
increased contacts with mental health services (either hospital admission or treatment with a 
home treatment or crisis service) between the antibody-positive patients (mean 0·4, SD 0·6) 
and the antibody-negative patients (0·5, 0·7; p=0·51), or in the mean follow-up GAF ratings 
(antibody-positive 66·5 [SD 15·5] vs antibody-negative 63·4 [15·7]; p=0·52). No cases of 
encephalitis or development of neurological symptoms were reported in any patients, as 
assessed by their treating psychiatrist.

 Discussion
In this study, which is the largest to our knowledge to examine the prevalence of neuronal 
cell surface antibodies in serum samples of patients with first-episode psychosis, we have 
shown that NMDAR antibodies were more prevalent in patients with first-episode psychosis 
than in the healthy control group. The prevalence of antibodies against GABAAR, LGI1, and 
VGKC-complex did not differ between the groups. ORs adjusted for current smoking, 
alcohol consumption, and illicit drug use were also non-significant. No major differences 
were found in clinical phenotype between antibody-positive and antibody-negative cases; 
however, patients who tested positive for neuronal cell surface antibodies scored 
significantly lower on PANSS positive items and PANSS total score, as well as on the Bush-
Francis Catatonia Rating Scale.
Our NMDAR antibody findings corroborate an earlier report11 that found that two (4%) out 
of 46 patients with first-episode psychosis had NMDAR antibodies, and provide support for 
the many converging lines of research evidence suggesting that NMDAR hypofunction plays 
an important part in schizophrenia.26 Susceptibility genes for schizophrenia—both common 
and rare variants—are particularly associated with glutamatergic transmission and with the 
adaptive immune system.27 Pharmacological blockade of NMDAR produces the full 
spectrum of symptoms seen in schizophrenia, as well as the neuropathological findings of 
reduced numbers of inhibitory GABAergic interneurons and reduced dendritic spine density 
that are compatible with a model of NMDAR blockade.26,28 Antibodies to the NMDAR at 
the onset of illness might be the basis for these findings in some patients.
We used a live cell-based assay to assess antibody status for all antibodies except VGKC-
complex and antinuclear antibodies. In a live cell-based assay, the serum to be tested for 
autoreactivity is incubated with live HEK293 cells—previously transfected with plasmids 
encoding the specific antigen subunits—before these cells are fixed.2 By contrast, both 
commercial assays and those performed by most other laboratories involve fixation or 
permeabilisation of cells before incubation with serum or CSF.29 The effects of fixation and 
permeabilisation (and other inter-assay differences) on the relative sensitivities and 
specificities of these assays are unknown. This situation is particularly true when the assay is 
used in psychiatric populations for whom—unlike in some autoimmune CNS disorders such 
as neuromyelitis optica30—no well established and clinically defined group exists against 
which such sensitivity and specificity can be assessed independently of autoantibody status. 
However, in assays other than live cell-based assays, permeabilisation of the cell membrane 
probably exposes intracellular antigens, and so seropositivity might indicate the presence of 
antibodies that can bind intracellular epitopes; these antibodies would not be expected to be 
pathogenic.
VGKC-complex antibody levels, as measured by radioimmunoassay, did not differ 
significantly between patients with first-episode psychosis and controls, and no individuals 
with VGKC-complex antibodies had antibodies against LGI1 or CASPR2. The relevance of 
these antibodies in psychosis is therefore uncertain, and a high level of VGKC-complex 
antibodies alone might not be clinically relevant in psychosis.

 In this study, antibody-positive patients had a lower level of catatonic and psychotic 
symptoms than did antibody-negative patients. The absolute difference in symptom scores 
was modest, and does not reflect clinically meaningful differences. However, this result 
contrasts with a previous case series of patients with NMDAR antibodies and psychosis in 
which the patients were described as being more psychiatrically unwell than a typical group 
of patients with schizophrenia, with increased catatonia and cognitive impairment, and with 
adverse reactions to antipsychotics.31 These previous cases might have been subject to 
selection bias, whereby clinicians preferentially requested the antibody test only if the 
patient presented with atypical features suggestive of encephalitis.
The prevalence of IgG antibodies detected in this study is higher than that described in most 
other groups of patients with either first-episode psychosis or long-standing illness (ranging 
from 0·0% to 1·6%).14–16 A notable exception is a study13 in children with psychosis 
tested a median of 5 weeks after onset of symptoms, which found 12% prevalence of 
NMDAR IgG antibodies, with none in healthy or illness (neurological or general medical) 
controls. A possible explanation is the short length of treatment with antipsychotics in our 
group. Antipsychotics have been shown to have immunomodulatory properties,32 even 
showing therapeutic promise in an animal model of autoimmune encephalitis.33 Some 
studies13,15,16 have detected IgM and IgA antibodies to neuronal targets, but we did not 
specifically look for IgM or IgA antibodies in this study as previous attempts to demonstrate 
them on live NMDAR assays have been unsuccessful (AV, LJ; unpublished data).
A limitation of the study is that we did not collect CSF, owing to the impracticality of doing 
lumbar punctures in routine UK mental health settings. Detection of antibodies in CSF 
might provide a more definitive indicator of the functional relevance of the antibodies. 
However, a study34 has shown that antibodies that have crossed the blood–brain barrier tend 
to bind to the brain—with the brain acting as an immunoprecipitator—and will therefore not 
be measurable in CSF. Therefore, an absence of antibodies in CSF does not prove that 
antibodies are not causing illness in an individual. A further limitation to our study is that 
antibody status was measured at a single timepoint only. We were therefore unable to 
establish whether autoreactivity precedes the development of symptoms, which is the case in 
many autoimmune diseases. If so, a second hit causing disruption of the blood–brain barrier 
could plausibly be required for pathogenic antibodies to access the CNS and affect neuronal 
function, as has been suggested elsewhere.16 We looked only at patients with first-episode 
psychosis. Pathogenic antibodies might be associated with other acute or subacute onset 
neuropsychiatric disorders with overlapping features with encephalitis, such as depression, 
dementia, or acute confusional states.
Further work is required to establish the specificity and pathogenicity of antibodies in the 
context of psychosis. The demonstration that even a small proportion of cases of 
schizophrenia-like psychosis have an autoimmune basis would have important ramifications 
for nosology and for treatment, because affected patients might respond to immunotherapy 
rather than antipsychotics or psychological interventions. Our study suggests that, at present, 
the only way to detect patients with these potentially pathogenic antibodies is to screen all 
patients with first-episode psychosis at first presentation.

 Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched MEDLINE for studies published from Jan 1, 2001, to Aug 31, 2016, on the 
prevalence of neuronal cell surface antibodies in patients with psychosis. We used search 
terms “antibod*” AND “psychosis” OR ”schiz*” AND “NMDA*” OR ”N-methyl-D-
aspartate receptor” OR “LGI1” OR “CASPR2” OR “mGluR5” OR “AMPA*” OR 
“GABAA*” OR “GABAB”. We excluded non-English language articles. Several studies 
have examined the prevalence of serum NMDAR antibodies, with one systematic review 
and meta-analysis of nine studies—including 3387 participants—showing three times 
greater (odds ratio 3·1) NMDAR antibody positivity in patients with schizophrenia or 
schizoaffective disorder, bipolar affective disorder, or major depressive disorder 
compared with controls. Subsequent studies have reported varying results. One study in 
children found five (12%) of 43 children with psychosis with NMDAR IgG antibodies, 
and no such antibodies in 43 healthy or illness controls. The largest studies did not find 
any seropositive psychosis cases, or found equivalent prevalence in healthy controls. One 
study found similar seropositivity for LGI1 and CASPR2 antibodies in patients with 
established schizophrenia and in healthy controls. Another found no antibodies against 
AMPAR in 459 participants with psychiatric illness or healthy controls. No studies have 
examined the prevalence of GABAAR antibodies in patients with psychosis.
Added value of this study
We found no overall differences in prevalence of antibodies against neuronal cell surface 
proteins in the serum of well characterised patients with first-episode psychosis and with 
less than 6 weeks on antipsychotic drugs compared with a healthy control sample. 
NMDAR antibodies were present in the serum samples of patients with first-episode 
psychosis whereas none were detected in controls. This result provides an improved 
estimate of the prevalence of neuronal cell surface antibodies associated with the onset of 
psychotic illness.
Implications of all the available evidence
Our finding that NMDAR antibodies can be detected in the serum of patients with first-
episode psychosis at a higher rate than in controls supports existing evidence that reduced 
activity of the NMDAR has an important role in schizophrenia. Antibodies to the 
NMDAR at the onset of illness might be the basis for these findings in some patients. 
Patients with these antibodies might respond to treatment with immunotherapy and we 
therefore suggest screening of patients with first-episode psychosis.
