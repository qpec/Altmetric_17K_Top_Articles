 POINT OF VIEW
Tuberculosis innovations mean
little if they cannot save lives
Abstract The past decade has seen the emergence of new diagnostics and drugs for tuberculosis, a
disease that kills over 1.8 million people each year. However, these new tools are yet to reach scale,
and access remains a major challenge for patients in low and middle income countries. Urgent action
is needed if we are committed to ending the TB epidemic. This means raising the level of ambition,
embracing innovation, increasing financial investments, addressing implementation gaps, and
ensuring that new technologies reach those who need them to survive. Otherwise, the promise of
innovative technologies will never be realized.

As the old saying goes, never bring a knife to a
gunfight. And yet, the global tuberculosis (TB)
community has been doing exactly that for deca-
des – fighting a protracted battle with anti-
quated, inefficient tools (Pai et al., 2016), and
losing millions of patients in the process.
The most commonly used TB test, sputum
smear microscopy, dates back to 1882, the time
Robert Koch first demonstrated the bacilli under
a
microscope.
The
Bacille
Calmette–Gue
´ rin
(BCG) vaccine, first used in humans in 1921, is
still used globally, even though it has been
largely ineffective in controlling the TB epidemic.
On the treatment front, the TB community had
to wait for nearly 50 years for new TB drugs to
reach the market.
Lack of good tools has cost us dearly. Last
year, the World Health Organization (WHO)
declared that the TB epidemic was worse than
previously thought, with an estimated 10.4 mil-
lion new TB cases in 2015 (World Health Orga-
nization, 2016a). WHO also estimated that 1.8
million people died from TB in 2015, making TB
a bigger killer than HIV and malaria combined.
Thanks to concerted efforts by donors, indus-
try,
product
development
partnerships,
and
other stakeholders, the past decade has seen
the emergence of new diagnostics and drugs for
TB. However, these new tools are yet to reach
scale, and access remains a major challenge for
patients in low and middle income countries
(Pai and Schito, 2015; Furin et al., 2016).
Access to new diagnostics
Several new TB diagnostics have emerged on
the market and many have also been policy-
endorsed by WHO and other agencies (Pai and
Schito, 2015). These new diagnostics include
Xpert� MTB/RIF (Cepheid Inc, Sunnyvale, Cali-
fornia) (World Health Organization, 2013a),
line probe assays (World Health Organization,
2016b), urine lipoarabinomannan antigen detec-
tion test (World Health Organization, 2015a),
liquid
cultures
(World
Health
Organization,
2007),
and
interferon-gamma
release
assays
(World Health Organization, 2014a).
Although
it
is
widely
acknowledged
that
rapid, accurate diagnosis is critical for timely ini-
tiation of anti-TB treatment, many people with
TB (or symptoms of TB) struggle to access an
adequate initial diagnosis. This is underscored
by the fact that an estimated 41% of the 10.4
million new cases globally are either undiag-
nosed or not reported (World Health Organiza-
tion, 2016a). These “missing” 4.3 million people
with TB contribute to ongoing TB transmission,
including the transmission of multidrug-resistant
TB (MDR-TB).
Even if diagnosed with TB, access to universal
drug-susceptibility testing is far from reality for

 most patients in high burden settings. Nearly
75% of the 480,000 cases of MDR-TB are either
not detected or not reported (World Health
Organization, 2016a). Even among previously
treated patients at risk of drug-resistance and
mortality, nearly 40% are not tested for drug
resistance.
Cumulatively, since the launch of the Xpert
MTB/RIF assay in 2010, over 6,500 GeneXpert
machines and 23 million Xpert MTB/RIF car-
tridges had been procured in the public sector
in 130 of the 145 countries eligible for conces-
sional
pricing,
as
of
31
December
2016
(World Health Organization, 2017a; Figure 1).
While this trend is promising, the volume of
Xpert MTB/RIF testing remains a small propor-
tion of all TB tests conducted in high burden
countries. It is estimated that over 77 million
sputum smears are performed annually in 22 of
the highest TB burden countries, including fol-
low-up tests (Kik et al., 2014). With the notable
exception of South Africa, which has rolled-out
Xpert MTB/RIF on a national scale and accounts
for almost 50% of global Xpert MTB/RIF vol-
umes, other countries are still reliant on insensi-
tive smears (FIND et al., 2015). This is reflected
in the ratio of smear volumes to the number of
Xpert MTB/RIF cartridges procured. In 2014, the
ratio in South Africa was 1.6 – significantly lower
than most other high burden countries, where
approximately 40–70 smears were performed for
each Xpert MTB/RIF test (Qin et al., 2015).
Although the ratio has become more favorable
to Xpert MTB/RIF in 2015, smears still dominate
the TB testing landscape in high burden coun-
tries
(Danielle
Cazabon,
personal
communication).
From a policy perspective, only eight coun-
tries
have
made
Xpert
MTB/RIF
the
initial
diagnostic
test for
all people
suspected of
having TB, despite the high accuracy of the
test and its ability to rapidly detect drug resis-
tance (Albert et al., 2016). Even when the
technology is available, access is limited to
patients. A recent large, international study of
Xpert
MTB/RIF
access and utilization
in 18
countries found that the majority of sites had
access to Xpert MTB/RIF, but only 4% of TB/
HIV co-infected patients were actually tested
using Xpert MTB/RIF (Clouse et al., 2017).
Lack of diagnostics with high sensitivity, and
inadequate access to drug-susceptibility test-
ing forces patients to make multiple visits and
spend a lot of money, and increases morbidity
(Chavan, 2017).
Children are an especially vulnerable popula-
tion when it comes to TB and MDR-TB. Although
tools like Xpert have been endorsed for use in
children (World Health Organization, 2013a),
and Xpert has been shown to greatly improve
the
detection
of
MDR-TB
in
children
(Raizada et al., 2014), access remains a concern
in this subgroup.
Why are new TB diagnostics not reaching
the
patients
who
need
it
the
most?
As
reviewed
by
Albert
and
colleagues
(Albert et al., 2016), the roll-out of Xpert
MTB/RIF has highlighted major implementation
gaps that have constrained scale-up of this
technology and limited its impact on patient
outcomes. The roll-out has been hampered by
high costs for cash-starved national TB control
programs in high-burden countries. It is not
just the cost of testing, but also the cost of
treating MDR-TB, since Xpert MTB/RIF invari-
ably identifies more patients with drug-resis-
tance than conventional testing.
Another barrier for scale-up of Xpert MTB/
RIF has been a lack of a complete diagnostic
package for TB that includes comprehensive
training,
quality
assurance,
implementation
plans, and maintenance support (Albert et al.,
2016). Also, pragmatic trials have shown that
the clinical impact of Xpert has been blunted by
weak health systems, resulting in prolonged

 time to diagnosis and treatment, compounded
by empirical therapy by healthcare providers
(Theron et al., 2014; Durovni et al., 2014;
Churchyard et al., 2015).
In India, for example, an average TB patient
is diagnosed after a delay of nearly two months
and
after
seeing
three
providers
(Sreeramareddy et al., 2014), and diagnosis is
a major gap in the cascade of care in the public
sector
(Subbaraman
et
al.,
2016)
and
the private sector (Das et al., 2015). In South
Africa, even though Xpert MTB/RIF and line
probe assays are freely available in centralized
laboratories, studies show long delays between
sample collection and initiation of TB treatment
(Hanrahan et al., 2012; Naidoo et al., 2014),
and missed opportunities to deploy tests that
are available (Chihota et al., 2015).
In many countries the private sector plays a
dominant role in care provision, yet this sector
has been excluded from concessional Xpert
MTB/RIF pricing, resulting in high costs for
patients who pay an average price of nearly USD
70 for the test (Puri et al., 2016). In addition,
quality of TB care, especially diagnosis, is a con-
cern in the private sector (Das et al., 2015).
Addressing this requires a comprehensive pri-
vate sector engagement strategy that includes
patient-centric quality care as a centerpiece
(Cazabon et al., 2017).
In many countries, TB control receives limited
domestic funding, and many low-income coun-
tries are heavily reliant on external donor funding
(Floyd et al., 2013). India is a case in point.
Despite having the largest number of TB patients
in the world, the country’s governmental expen-
diture on health is one of the lowest in the world
at 1.4% of GDP (The Lancet, 2017). This under-
investment
is
reflected
in
India’s
Revised
National Tuberculosis Control Program (RNTCP),
which has struggled to receive budgets neces-
sary to tackle the world’s biggest TB epidemic
(Pai et al., 2017). This, in turn, has made India
rely heavily on old tools such as smear micros-
copy. Although over 600 GeneXpert systems are
now available in the Indian public sector, and
have been shown to dramatically increase the
MDR-TB case detection rates (Sachdeva et al.,
2015), the country has restricted the use of this
technology primarily to individuals at risk of
MDR-TB, persons with TB/HIV co-infection, and
children. This might improve with India’s new,
ambitious plan to eliminate TB by 2025, although
it is unclear whether India’s TB control budget
will match the ambition (Pai et al., 2017).
Access to new drugs
Even if access to new diagnostics was to be dra-
matically improved, patients still need adequate
access to drugs. The past five years have been a
period of great potential with the introduction
of two new therapeutic agents for the treatment
of MDR-TB: delamanid (Otsuka Pharmaceutical
Co, Tokyo, Japan) and bedaquiline (Janssen
Therapeutics,
NJ,
USA)
(Gler
et
al.,
2012;
Diacon et al., 2014; Field et al., 2012). Both
drugs have been conditionally approved by
stringent
regulatory
authorities
and
recom-
mended by the WHO for the treatment of MDR-
TB in situations in which there is resistance or
intolerance to the other second-line agents or a
high risk of treatment failure (World Health
Organization, 2013b; World Health Organiza-
tion, 2014b).
Although there was initial excitement about
the availability of these new drugs, because they
were approved using phase IIB data, their use was
recommended in a cautious way (World Health
Organization, 2013b; World Health Organiza-
tion,
2014b,
World
Health
Organization,
2017b). Since then, global introduction has not
kept pace with the dire need for these drugs,
especially for patients with drug-resistant disease
who endure prolonged, toxic therapies with poor
outcomes (Lessem et al., 2015). Complicating
this have been the long delays seen in starting piv-
otal
late-stage
clinical
trials
for
MDR-TB
(RESIST TB, 2017).
A conservative estimate is that one-third of
newly diagnosed patients with rifampicin-resis-
tance will have an indication for a new drug dur-
ing the treatment for MDR-TB, although some
studies suggest that as many as two-thirds of
patients would benefit from the new drugs
(Bonnet et al., 2016). This means that there are
between 200,000 and 400,000 persons in need
of the novel medications each year. Even a more
conservative estimate, based on a third of the

 total number of persons actually started on
MDR-TB treatment each year, reveals a major
access gap among the 41,667 patients who
urgently need these medications each year.
Currently, just over 8,000 patients have ever
received either bedaquiline or delamanid for the
treatment of MDR-TB under program conditions
(DR-TB STAT, 2017). Recent optimistic reports
about new drug uptake released by the WHO –
which state there are 70 countries using beda-
quiline and 39 using delamanid – are somewhat
misleading in that they count any country that
has treated a single patient with a new drug,
even
under
compassionate
use
conditions
(World Health Organization, 2016a).
Program use data shows that as of March 1,
2017 there were 8,195 persons who have ever
taken bedaquiline and 496 who have ever taken
delamanid
under
program
conditions
(DR-
TB STAT, 2017; Figure 2). Of note, 60% of
global bedaquiline use is from South Africa (DR-
TB STAT, 2017). So, most countries are either
not using the new drugs or are focused only on
small pilot projects. One example of this is in the
Pan-American
Health
Organization
(PAHO)
region of the world, where it is estimated that
there are more than 7,000 patients in need of
either bedaquiline or delamanid, but fewer than
100 individuals who have received either of
these medications.
There are several barriers for wider use of
bedaquiline and delamanid (Furin et al., 2016).
Some of these are related to costs and registra-
tion. Although there is a bedaquiline donation
program that allows Global Fund eligible coun-
tries to obtain bedaquiline free of charge, coun-
tries who are not eligible for this donation often
pay a high price via a tiered pricing structure,
with middle-income countries paying USD 3,000
for a six-month course of the drug, and high
income countries paying as much as USD 26,000
for the six-month course – costs that are almost
impossible to bear for poorly funded TB pro-
grams (Gotham et al., 2017). Some countries,
however, have recognized that the cost of pur-
chasing bedaquiline is lower than the cost to
health systems of the ongoing spread of MDR-
TB, as seen in the successful South African pro-
gram. South Africa has to purchase its own
bedaquiline yet it accounts for more than 60% of
the global use (Ndjeka, 2016).
Delamanid is available for purchase at USD
1,700 for Global Fund eligible countries, but the
costs in non-Global Fund eligible countries are
excessive
and
may
be
as
much
as
Euro
30,000 (approximately USD 32,000) in some set-
tings (Gotham et al., 2017). While bedaquiline
has been registered in a range of countries –
including the high burden countries of South
Africa and India – delamanid only has regulatory
approval
in
four
regions:
European
Union,
Japan, South Korea, and Macau. None of these
areas have a high burden of MDR-TB, and
delamanid is still not registered in most of the
countries where clinical trials were done.
Other important country-level barriers seem
to be driving the slow uptake of new drugs on
the part of national TB programs, regulatory
agencies, and clinical providers. Some of these
barriers are based in excessive concern about
potential
side
effects,
a
concern
that
needs to be balanced with the high mortality
rate in persons with poorly treated MDR-TB and
the high rate of serious adverse events that
occur
using
the
existing
medications
(Ahuja et al., 2012). There is tension between
wanting to “protect the new drugs” as opposed
to protecting the lives of patients, with the drugs
being restricted in order to purportedly preserve
their efficacy. This was the situation in a recent
court case where a young woman and her family
sued the Indian government to provide her with
access to bedaquiline – a case they won – but
the government argued that doing so would risk
the
development
of
bedaquiline
resistance
(Kirby, 2017).
There has been almost no involvement of the
private sector in the use of new drugs, even in
private sector tertiary care facilities that have a
proven
track
record
in
the
successful

 management
of
MDR-TB
(Udwadia
et
al.,
2017). There are also complicated pharmacovi-
gilance
requirements
for
new
drugs
(World Health Organization, 2015b) that have
delayed their use in some settings (Furin et al.,
2016). And most countries feel compelled to fol-
low the interim WHO guidance to the letter on
the use of these medications, and guidelines can
lag behind the most relevant safety and efficacy
data. Given the rapid accumulation of data on
the safety and efficacy of these drugs, rigid
adherence
to
interim
policies
can
delay
access to life-saving drugs for patients. It should
be noted, however, that most countries are
unable to implement new drugs even following
these restrictive recommendations.
Children are especially vulnerable to TB and
MDR-TB and they have been largely overlooked
when it comes to access to the new drugs, even
though delamanid was recommended by the
WHO for children as young as six years of age in
2016. Such exclusion is often a result of a desire
to “protect” children from the unknown adverse
effects of novel agents, a practice that is espe-
cially concerning given the well-known toxicity of
the injectable agents (Weld et al., 2017). Not
only is there a need to include children earlier in
the
clinical
trials
of
novel
agents
(Nachman et al., 2015), but there is also a need
to develop child-friendly formulations of the
medications (Furin et al., 2015), something that
is being pursued with both bedaquiline and
delamanid.
Other
populations
vulnerable
to
exclusion include pregnant women and persons
with extrapulmonary TB. Thus, countries should
make plans for off-label use of new drugs in
these individuals, should the benefits outweigh
the risks.
Silver linings and potential
solutions
Amidst the disappointingly slow pace of new
tool uptake, there are some positive examples
and potential solutions. South Africa has been
exceptional in scaling-up both Xpert MTB/RIF
and bedaquiline, due in large part to a forward-
thinking National TB Program and Department
of Health, backed by an ambitious Health Minis-
ter, and supported by academic and non-gov-
ernmental organization partners (Ndjeka et al.,
2015). Other countries too have had success
introducing bedaquiline, especially when they
prioritized patient needs, were flexible with their
innovations, and partnered with other support-
ing groups (Guglielmetti et al., 2017). Also, the
early success of tools like Xpert MTB/RIF and
bedaquiline have renewed industry engagement
in TB R&D, pushed countries to develop systems
for conducting field trials for policy changes, and
revitalized front-line health workers and civil
society (Pai and Schito, 2015; Furin et al.,
2017). It is also wonderful to see countries
develop more ambitious plans for TB elimina-
tion, with India being a prominent, recent exam-
ple (Central TB Division, 2017).
Many of the barriers to optimal use of novel
diagnostic and therapeutic strategies can be
readily surmounted with bold ambitions that are
followed up with concrete implementation. With
regards to new diagnostics, we need a compre-
hensive
approach
to
their
implementation
(Albert
et
al.,
2016),
including
increased
engagement of patients, civil society, and policy
makers; demand creation for new tools among
diverse stakeholders; broader health systems
strengthening
in
preparation
for
new
tools;
increased advocacy for TB financing; and mar-
ket-based approaches to address both demand
and supply side barriers (Engel et al., 2016).
These solutions are particularly relevant as WHO
recently endorsed the use of Xpert MTB/RIF
Ultra, a more sensitive assay than the current
Xpert MTB/RIF cartridge (World Health Organi-
zation,
2017c),
and
point-of-care
molecular
diagnostics (e.g. GeneXpert Omni) are becom-
ing a reality.
When it comes to the novel agents, while
there are indeed limited data on their use in
large populations, this should always be consid-
ered in the context of currently recommended
treatment regimens, which are based on expert
opinion and observational data, are associated
with poor treatment outcomes, and are associ-
ated with an unacceptable safety profile that has
been well documented. When viewed through
this lens, the introduction of new therapeutic
options can only be seen as a welcome event.

There has now been sufficient experience in the
successful introduction of novel agents for MDR-
TB, and the programs and providers responsible
for this success should be leading the global roll-
out of these drugs. Finally, urgent patient needs
must be prioritized, with the organizations and
agencies failing to address these needs being
held accountable for delayed or denied access.
After all, “protecting human rights, ethics and
equity” is one of the four key principles of the
WHO End TB Strategy (World Health Organiza-
tion, 2017d).
Conclusions
New diagnostic and treatment options have
been sought for decades in the field of TB and
MDR-TB, and new tools have been successfully
introduced. But we have learnt the hard way
that availability does not necessarily result in
widespread
access.
Considerable
effort
is
required to make sure new tools are made
accessible to the persons who need them most.
This has not happened as quickly as desired with
tools such as Xpert MTB/RIF, bedaquiline, and
delamanid, and the result is that tens of thou-
sands of TB patients around the world suffer
needlessly from late or misdiagnosis, ineffective
treatment, or intolerable side effects. The mere
fact that 1.8 million people die of a potentially
curable infection each year is the surest indica-
tion that they are not getting the quality care
they deserve.
Urgent action is needed if we are committed
to ending TB in a mere 13 years. This means
embracing innovation, increasing financial invest-
ments in TB control, addressing implementation
gaps, and making sure that new technologies
are available in the service of those who are try-
ing to survive. More importantly, the global TB
community needs to learn from the HIV/AIDS
experience, and raise its level of ambition. This
means a change in the mindset, to not settle for
less.
