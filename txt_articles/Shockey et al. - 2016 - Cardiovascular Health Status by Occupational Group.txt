Cardiovascular disease (CVD) accounts for one of every three 
deaths in the United States, making it the leading cause of 
mortality in the country (1). The American Heart Association 
established seven ideal cardiovascular health behaviors or 
modifiable factors to improve CVD outcomes in the United 
States. These cardiovascular health metrics (CHMs) are 1) not 
smoking, 2) being physically active, 3) having normal blood 
pressure, 4) having normal blood glucose, 5) being of normal 
weight, 6) having normal cholesterol levels, and 7) eating a 
healthy diet (2). Meeting six or all seven CHMs is associated 
with a lower risk for all-cause, CVD, and ischemic heart 
disease mortalities compared with the risk to persons who 
meet none or only one CHM (3). Fewer than 2% of U.S. 
adults meet all seven of the American Heart Association’s 
CHMs (4). Cardiovascular morbidity and mortality account 
for an estimated annual $120 billion in lost productivity in 
the workplace; thus, workplaces are viable settings for effec-
tive health promotion programs (5). With over 130 million 
employed persons in the United States, accounting for about 
55% of all U.S. adults, the working population is an important 
demographic group to evaluate with regard to cardiovascular 
health status. To determine if an association between occupa-
tion and CHM score exists, CDC analyzed data from the 
2013 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 
industry and occupation module, which was implemented 
in 21 states. Among all occupational groups, community and 
social services employees (14.6%), transportation and material 
moving employees (14.3%), and architecture and engineering 
employees (11.6%) had the highest adjusted prevalence of 
meeting two or fewer CHMs. Transportation and material 
moving employees also had the highest prevalence of “not 
ideal” (“0” [i.e., no CHMs met]) scores for three of the seven 
CHMs: physical activity (54.1%), blood pressure (31.9%), 
and weight (body mass index [BMI]; 75.5%). Disparities in 
cardiovascular health status exist among U.S. occupational 
groups, making occupation an important consideration in 
employer-sponsored health promotion activities and allocation 
of prevention resources.
BRFSS is a national, random-digit–dialed telephone survey 
conducted annually by U.S. states and territories to gather 
data on health-related risk behaviors, chronic illnesses and 
conditions, and use of health-related services among non-
institutionalized, civilian residents aged ≥18 years.* BRFSS 
includes a standard set of core questions that are asked every 
year; however, states can chose from optional modules on 
specific subjects or include state-added questions. In 2013, 
21 states† adopted the optional industry and occupation 
module or asked state-added questions regarding industry 
and occupation. Combined landline and cell phone response

rates§ in the 21 states ranged from 31.1% in Washington to 
59.2% in North Dakota, with an overall median of 44.0%. 
The optional module contained two questions on industry 
and occupation. Participants who were employed for wages, 
self-employed, or out of work for <1 year were asked, “What 
kind of business or industry do you work in?” and “What kind 
of work do you do?” Participant responses were open-ended, 
and were later coded to one of the 574 Bureau of Census 
(2002) occupation numeric codes; these were grouped for 
analysis into 22 Standard Occupational Classification System 
major groups.¶ Respondents were excluded if information 
about employment was missing, if they were on active military 
duty, or if they were unpaid or retired workers. Responses for 
each of the seven CHMs were scored as “0” for not ideal or 
“1” for meeting the ideal of that individual metric based on 
self-reported responses to questions about whether or not 
the respondent had ever been told by a health care provider 
that he or she had high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or 
diabetes. Other questions about smoking, exercise, and weight 
were calculated from BRFSS or derived from multiple BRFSS 
questions.** The seven CHMs were summed for a score, with 
a range of 0–7. For the purposes of this study, the CHM score 
was dichotomized into two groups: 0–2 and 3–7. CHM scores 
were analyzed by occupational group, adjusted for sociode-
mographic variables, including age, sex, race/ethnicity, and 
education level, using logistic regression models in SUDAAN.

** Individual cardiovascular health metrics (BRFSS questions): Blood pressure: 
“Have you ever been told by a doctor, nurse or other health professional 
that you have high blood pressure?” Options: Met ideal (1) = No; Not ideal 
(0) = Yes; Cholesterol: “Have you ever been told by a doctor, nurse or other 
health professional that your blood cholesterol is high?” Options: Met ideal 
(1) = No; Not ideal (0) = Yes; Glucose: “Have you ever been told you have 
diabetes?” Met ideal (1) = No; Not ideal (0) = Yes; Smoking status: BRFSS 
calculated variable; Met ideal (1) = respondents who reported they had not 
smoked at least 100 cigarettes in their lifetime, those who reported having 
smoked 100 cigarettes in their lifetime but do not currently smoke; Not ideal 
(0) = respondents who reported having smoked at least 100 cigarettes in their 
lifetime and currently smoke; Physical activity: BRFSS calculated variable; 
Met ideal (1) = respondents who meet the recommendation of ≥150 minutes 
per week of moderate intensity activity, ≥75 minutes of vigorous-intensity 
activity, or an equivalent combination of aerobic physical activity; Not ideal 
(0) = respondents who did not meet the previously listed recommendation 
of physical activity; Body mass index (BMI): BRFSS calculated variable; Met 
ideal (1) = respondents who have a BMI ≥18.5 kg/m2, also a BMI <25 kg/m2; 
Not ideal (0) = respondents who have a BMI ≥25 kg/m2; Diet: Derived from 
multiple BRFSS questions. Fruit and vegetable intake was reported via a six-
item screener on consumption of 100% fruit juice, whole fruit, dried beans, 
dark green vegetables, and other vegetables during the previous month. Persons 
were classified as having an ideal diet if their consumption met or exceeded age- 
and sex-specific federal fruit and vegetable intake recommendations for persons 
with a sedentary lifestyle (http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/content/181/12/979.

Adjusted prevalence and prevalence ratios were obtained 
for CHM scores of 0–2, and for each of the seven individual 
metrics that contribute to the CHM score, an adjusted preva-
lence was calculated for not ideal scores. All analyses were 
weighted unless otherwise noted. Significance was determined 
by evaluating confidence intervals at a = 0.05.
Overall, 102,258 BRFSS participants were currently 
employed and, therefore, considered for analyses. Among 
these, 20,771 were excluded because occupation informa-
tion was missing (n = 16,412 [16%]) or they were on active 
military duty (n = 268 [0.3%]), unpaid or retired workers 
(n = 149 [0.1%]), or had a diagnosis of CVD (n = 3,942 
[4%]). Among the remaining 81,487 participants, 14,878 were 
excluded because responses were missing for one or more of 
the 12 BRFSS questions used to calculate the CHM score. A 
total of 66,609 respondents (65.1% of the original sample of 
currently employed) were left for analysis. Adults aged 35–44, 
45–54, and 55–64 years accounted for approximately 70% of 
the sample population; men accounted for approximately 53%, 
and non-Hispanic whites accounted for 66%. Approximately 
39% of the sample population had graduated from college 
or technical school. The prevalence of meeting two or fewer 
CHMs was highest among persons aged ≥65 years (18.6%), 
men (11.1%), non-Hispanic blacks (12.2%), and persons with 
less than a high school education (17.7%) (Table 1).
Among all occupational groups combined, 3.5% of workers 
met all seven CHMs (score = 7). Transportation and material 
moving employees had the highest adjusted prevalence of not 
ideal (e.g., 0) scores for physical activity (54.1%), blood pres-
sure (31.9%), and BMI (75.5%) (Table 2). Food preparation 
and serving employees had the highest adjusted prevalence 
of not ideal scores for smoking (22.8%), and computer and 
mathematical employees had the highest adjusted prevalence of 
not ideal scores for cholesterol (39.9%). In addition, personal 
care and service employees had the highest adjusted prevalence 
of not ideal scores for blood glucose (10.3%), and farming, 
fishing, and forestry employees had the highest prevalence of 
not ideal scores for diet (84.3%).
The prevalence of meeting two or fewer CHMs among all 
22 occupational groups was 9.6% (Table 3). Transportation 
and material moving employees (14.3%) and community and 
social services employees (14.6%) had the highest adjusted 
prevalence of meeting two or fewer CHM, and farming, 
forestry, and fishing employees (5.0%), production (7.7%) 
and arts, design, entertainment, sports, and media employees 
(5.9%) had the lowest adjusted prevalence of meeting two or 
fewer CHM compared with the other occupational groups. 
The adjusted prevalence ratios (aPRs) indicate community 
and social services employees (aPR = 1.56) and transportations 
and material moving employees (aPR = 1.55) are significantly 
more likely to meet two or fewer CHM compared with the 
other occupational groups.

In 21 states, cardiovascular health indicators measured 
by CHM score differed among occupational groups, after

adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, and education level. 
Persons working in community and social services and trans-
portation and material moving had the highest prevalences 
of not ideal individual CHMs and were 56% and 55% more 
likely, respectively, than all other occupational groups to have 
met two or fewer CHMs. The findings for transportation and 
material moving occupations are consistent with a previous 
National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health study 
on the health of long-haul truck drivers. That study found that 
approximately 61% of truck drivers reported having two or 
more of the following health-related risk factors: high blood 
pressure, obesity, smoking, high cholesterol, no physical activ-
ity, or ≤6 hours of sleep within a 24-hour period (6).
The findings in this report are subject to at least five limita-
tions. First, respondents who were excluded because of miss-
ing data for one or more of the CHM variables were found 
to be significantly different from respondents who were not 
missing these data, based on demographic variables, includ-
ing occupation. This likely biases the results toward the null, 
Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Work conditions and organization have a direct impact on 
health. Findings from studies indicate the existence of an 
association between cardiovascular disease and certain job 
factors and between specific cardiovascular disease health 
behaviors (e.g., smoking status, etc.) and occupational group.
What is added by this report?
Using population-based data, occupational group was found to 
be significantly associated with both the individual cardiovascu-
lar health metrics (CHMs) and the CHM summary score. In 2013, 
prevalence of meeting two or fewer CHMs ranged from 5.0% 
among farming, fishing, and forestry employees to 14.6% 
among community and social services employees.
What are the implications for public health practice?
With significant health disparities among different occupational 
groups, the results of this study can be used by state organiza-
tions and private companies to target cardiovascular disease 
prevention programs and improve workplace health promotion.

because respondents who did not have missing data were more 
likely to be white, female, have a higher education level, and 
to hold a white-collar job. Had the overall sample with all 
respondents included been used, the significance of results 
presented would likely have been greater. Second, because 
BRFSS data are cross-sectional, it is not possible to make 
causal inferences. Third, BRFSS data are self-reported and 
therefore, rely on the accuracy of a participant’s memory 
and willingness to be truthful and are subject to recall and 
social desirability bias. Fourth, the data used in this study 
were from an optional industry and occupation module 
administered by 21 states, so findings might not be nation-
ally representative. Finally, the CHM score equally weights 
all seven metrics, which might not accurately reflect the 
individual impact of each metric on a person’s cardiovas-
cular health.
Although the CHMs are considered to be modifiable at the 
individual level, it is important to consider the impact that 
occupational factors might have on the metrics, including such 
factors as exposure to chemical and physical agents; workplace 
stress and adverse work organization related to workload and 
total hours; shift rotation; job assignment and design; and 
organizational culture (7,8). Additional research is needed to 
elucidate the relationship between work factors and cardio-
vascular health. The CDC Worksite Health ScoreCard was 
created to help employers evaluate their occupational safety and 
health and health promotion programs for prevention of heart 
disease, stroke, and other cardiovascular-related health effects. 
The scorecard, which was validated in a study of 93 employers 
in more than 32 states, includes 125 questions that solicit 
information on a various topics, such as occupational health 
and safety, physical activity, stress management, diabetes pre-
vention, and organization support (9). The American Heart 
Association projects that by 2030, 43.9% of the U.S. popula-
tion will have some type of CVD, and indirect costs attributed 
to lost productivity will increase by 58% to $290 billion (1). 
A growing body of scientific literature indicates that employ-
ment status and occupational group are important factors to 
consider in cardiovascular health research. The workplace is a 
viable and necessary site for carrying out cardiovascular health 
interventions, and attention to work conditions as a risk factor 
for CVD warrants further consideration (7,10).
