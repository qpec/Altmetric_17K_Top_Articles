 Mental healthcare staff wellbeing and burnout: A critical review of trends, causes, 
implications and recommendations for future interventions 
Abstract 
Background:  Rising levels of burnout and poor wellbeing in healthcare staff are an 
international concern for health systems. The need to improve wellbeing and reduce burnout 
has long been acknowledged, but few interventions target mental healthcare staff, and 
minimal improvements have been seen in services. 
Aims: To examine the problem of burnout and wellbeing in mental healthcare staff 
and present recommendations for future research and interventions.   
Methods: A discursive review examining trends, causes, implications and interventions 
in burnout and wellbeing in healthcare staff working in mental health services. Data were 
drawn from national surveys, reports and peer-reviewed journal articles.  
Results: Staff in mental healthcare report poorer wellbeing than staff in other 
healthcare sectors. Poorer wellbeing and higher burnout is associated with poorer quality and 
safety of patient care, higher absenteeism and higher turnover rates. Interventions are 
effective but effect sizes are small.  
Conclusions: Grounding interventions in the research literature, emphasising the 
positive aspects of interventions to staff, building stronger links between healthcare 
organisations and universities and designing interventions targeting burnout and improved 
patient care together may improve the effectiveness and uptake of interventions by staff.

 Mental healthcare staff wellbeing and burnout: A critical review of trends, causes, 
implications and recommendations for future interventions 
Background 
Burnout and poor wellbeing in healthcare staff are a growing problem (RCP, 2015). 
Burnout describes negative work-related attitudes made up of three facets: emotional 
exhaustion with work, depersonalisation or disengagement from patients and low personal 
accomplishment (Maslach & Jackson, 1981). Wellbeing is a more holistic concept that 
encompasses facets of mental health, physical health and stress. Higher levels of burnout are 
closely associated with lower levels of wellbeing in healthcare staff, and both states have a 
negative impact on patient care (Hall et al., 2016; Johnson et al., 2017a). In this review we 
consider both concepts together. 
The need to develop interventions to improve staff wellbeing and reduce burnout and 
to test their effectiveness has long been acknowledged (Gilbody et al., 2006). However, few 
interventions target mental healthcare staff, which is one factor contributing to the minimal 
improvements which have been seen in these staff. 
Aims and overview 
In this article, we critically examine the problems of burnout and poor wellbeing in 
mental healthcare staff in order to present recommendations for future research and 
interventions. We first review current rates and patterns of burnout and wellbeing in 
healthcare staff. We then make the case for the importance of addressing this area by 
outlining evidence that healthcare staff wellbeing is linked with quality and safety outcomes 
and that elevated service costs result from increased sickness absence rates and staff turnover. 
We review evidence of the effectiveness of interventions aimed at improving wellbeing and 
reducing burnout in healthcare professionals. Finally, we consider the limitations of current 
 research evidence and propose recommendations for future work in this area. Whilst the focus 
of the article is on mental healthcare staff, the wider literature on healthcare staff in other 
settings will be drawn on to provide context and additional evidence where this is lacking in 
mental health settings.   
Design 
 
A critical review of the literature was conducted. 
Methods 
 
In order to identify relevant peer-reviewed journal articles, literature database 
searches were undertaken (PsycInfo, Ovid Medline) and reference lists of relevant original 
articles and reviews were scanned. In order to identify relevant data not reported in journal 
articles, electronic data sources were accessed (Bureau of Labour Statistics, USA; Statistics 
Canada; Office of National Statistics, UK; NHS Digital). Specific requests for data were 
submitted to NHS Digital for relevant data not routinely available online. 
Discussion 
Current Rates of Stress and Burnout in Healthcare Staff 
Concerns about high levels of burnout and poor wellbeing in healthcare staff are an 
international phenomenon. A study of 61,168 nurses across 12 countries found that in nine 
countries a quarter or more of the nursing workforce was burnt-out, with rates as high as 78% 
in Greek nurses (Aiken et al., 2012). These rates may be rising; in a survey of 6880 USA 
physicians, burnout prevalence increased from 46% in 2011 to 54% in 2014 (Shanafelt et al., 
2015). In the UK, the proportion of staff feeling unwell due to work-related stress has risen 
from 28% in 2008 to 37% in 2016 (Figure 1A), and double the number of NHS staff left due to 
poor work-life balance in 2015 compared with 2011 (Figure 1B).

staff citing poor work-life balance as their reason for leaving their NHS post. (Source: NHS 
digital; https://data.gov.uk/dataset/nhs-workforce-reasons-for-leaving) (B). 
 
Stress and burnout in mental healthcare staff. Research into burnout and wellbeing in 
mental healthcare staff has lagged behind other areas of healthcare, but the research which 
has been conducted suggests burnout may be a particular problem in this group, with 
prevalence rates ranging from 21 to  67% (Morse et al., 2012). Amongst Iranian nurses, those 
working on psychiatric wards reported higher emotional exhaustion and depersonalisation 
than their surgical, internal medicine or burns ward-based colleagues (Sahraian et al., 2008). 
Concomitantly, in one study of Italian psychiatrists almost half (49%) reported high levels of 
emotional exhaustion (Bressi et al., 2009), and a recent study of UK psychological therapists 
categorised 69% as suffering from burnout (Westwood et al., 2017). Whilst the use of burnout 
cut-off scores is contentious, with some researchers arguing that norms for the scale are 
unreliable, and the use of a cut-off for a non-medical syndrome is flawed (Bianchi et al., 2017b; 
Bianchi et al., 2017a), these figures do indicate elevated levels of stress and negative work-
attitudes in mental healthcare staff. As discussed further below, this stress has a profound 
impact on productivity; 2016 figures suggest staff take more sick days than those in both acute 
 trusts and primary care (Figure 2). Work-related stress is also higher, with 41% of mental 
healthcare staff reporting feeling unwell due to stress in the last year compared with 35% in 
acute trusts (NHSDigital, 2016). 
 
Causes of Stress and Burnout in Mental Healthcare Staff  
The causes of burnout and stress in mental health care staff overlap with those of 
healthcare staff in other areas. These include inadequate staffing, excessive workload, poor 
leadership, lack of support and lack of opportunity for skills development (Graber et al., 2008; 
Willard-Grace et al., 2014; Pinikahana & Happell, 2004; Bressi et al., 2009). However, there are 
a number of differences between mental health services and other healthcare services which 
may account for the differences seen in this group. These include the �emotional labour� of 
caring for mentally unwell patients, high levels of violence, detaining and treating patients 
against their will, caring for patients who may harm themselves (Seago et al., 2001; Knickman 
& Snell, 2002; Letvak & Buck, 2008), and the underfunding of mental health services. 
Emotional labour. All healthcare work includes emotional labour but mental 
healthcare requires intense emotional involvement with patients over a prolonged period 
(Mann & Cowburn, 2005; Edwards & Burnard, 2003). These emotional demands induce 
moderate to high stress in mental healthcare staff (McGrath et al., 1989), as well as high rates 
of depression; the British Psychological Society reported that nearly half of its NHS-employed 
members had recently experienced depression (BPS, 2017).  
Violence. Violence against staff is higher in mental healthcare services than other 
sectors. In the UK, there were 46,107 reported assaults on mental health staff in 2015-16 and 
overall, assaults in the mental healthcare sector account for nearly 70% of all NHS reports of 
assaults on staff (NHS, 2010; Renwick et al., 2016). In a Taiwanese study, 19.3% of psychiatric 
nurses experienced physical violence annually, compared with 5.9% of general nurses (Shiao et 
 al., 2010). The impact of these assaults is costly both in terms of sickness and litigation, as well 
as the physical and psychological impact on staff victims (van Leeuwen & Harte, 2015).  
Involuntary detentions. Involuntary detentions mean staff will be caring for patients 
who do not choose to receive treatment, and in the UK there has been a year-on-year increase 
in the use of the Mental Health Act to detain patients. Coercive measures such as seclusion, 
restraint and forced medication are high risk, stressful activities for both patients and staff 
(Bonner et al., 2002). Although this trend is not uniform internationally, with some nations 
such as Sweden having seen reductions in involuntary detentions (Salize et al., 2002), it 
contributes to higher staff stress levels when it occurs.  
Risk of suicide. Completed patient suicides are comparatively rare, with less than 100 
occurring in mental healthcare in the UK annually (NCISH, 2016). However, they are more 
common in mental health services than other healthcare services.  When they happen the 
impact is strong and sustained, linked with loss of self-esteem, disturbed relationships with 
colleagues, friends and family, and feelings of guilt and anger (Kinney & Torigoe, 1988). 
Although completed suicide is rare, suicide attempts, suicidal ideation and self-harm are more 
common, and caring for such patients is emotionally taxing, requiring constant monitoring and 
management of the potential risk of suicide (Hagen et al., 2017). Risk management can be 
particularly challenging in community mental health services where staff do not have daily 
contact with patients and may be carrying large case loads.   
Underfunding of mental health services. Mental health services receive less funding 
relative to demand compared with physical health services. In the USA, growth in mental 
healthcare funding has been slower than growth in physical healthcare spending (Garfield, 
2011), and between 2009 and 2011 states cut in excess of $1.8 billion dollars from their mental 
healthcare budgets (Honberg et al., 2011). Similar underfunding for mental health services has 
also been widely reported in the UK (Gilburt, 2015). The result is services which are stretched 
 beyond their resources, placing greater demands on staff, creating a stressful and pressurised 
environment.  
Underlying mental health difficulties. Whilst uncomfortable, we must consider the 
possibility that rates of mental health difficulties in staff who are initially attracted to work in 
mental health services may be higher than elsewhere in the health system. Research in this 
area has been limited and results inconclusive (Mata et al., 2015). A study comparing types of 
nursing students found no evidence to suggest that mental healthcare nursing students 
reported significantly different levels of mental wellbeing to other types of nursing students, 
although they did report better use of coping strategies than nurses training in general adult or 
���������� ������� (Pryjmachuk & Richards, 2007). However, there are numerous anecdotal 
reports of staff inspired to enter the profession by virtue of their own previous mental health 
difficulties (Jamison, 1996; Gask, 2015), and increasingly these staff are exhorted to use their 
lived experience �� � ������ �� ���������� ��� ������ �� �������� which may strength 
therapeutic interactions (Oates et al., 2017; Perkins et al., 2010). Despite this, staff continue to 
describe concerns around disclosing their mental health problems (Waugh et al., 2017; Hassan, 
2015; Hassan et al., 2016; White et al., 2006). Whilst there is currently no clear evidence 
regarding underlying mental health problems as a cause of the poorer wellbeing in this mental 
healthcare staff, this possibility raises the question of how the wellbeing of staff in mental 
healthcare trusts is promoted.

Mental Health Staff Wellbeing and Quality and Safety of Patient Care 
Healthcare staff wellbeing/burnout and quality and safety. Staff wellbeing and 
burnout is associated with both patient safety and care quality. A recent review found that 22 
out of 27 studies reported a significant association between poor wellbeing and poorer patient 
safety outcomes, and 25 of 30 studies found a significant link between higher levels of burnout 
and increased adverse events (Hall et al., 2016). Further evidence for the link was offered by 
Welp and Manser (2016) who found that 66% of studied associations linked poor wellbeing 
and negative patient safety indicators. This pattern is replicated when patient satisfaction 
rather than patient safety is examined, and a recent meta-analysis of 63 studies reported that 
higher burnout was significantly associated with poorer patient satisfaction (Salyers et al., 
2016). 
Healthcare staff wellbeing and quality/safety in mental healthcare. Research into 
links between staff wellbeing and patient safety/quality of care is still limited in mental health 
 settings. However, two studies provide preliminary evidence for similar patterns to general 
healthcare. In the USA, a mindfulness-based-stress-reduction intervention in acute psychiatric 
staff improved patient satisfaction scores and decreased patient safety events in the three 
months post-intervention (Brady et al., 2012). A subsequent USA study tested cross-sectional 
associations between burnout and quality and safety outcomes. It found that the burnout 
subscales of high personal accomplishment and low depersonalisation were associated with 
overall quality of care scores, and emotional exhaustion and depersonalisation were 
associated with general work conscientiousness, although links were not found with perceived 
errors (Salyers et al., 2015). Given the strength of this finding in general healthcare, further 
research into these associations in mental healthcare is warranted. Supporting healthcare staff 
wellbeing may be an underexploited route to improving patient care. 
Mechanisms. Understanding why and how burnout and poor wellbeing impact patient 
care is key to targeting interventions (Craig et al., 2008). Conservation of Resources Theory 
(Hobfoll, 2002) suggests burnout occurs because of resource over-investment from the 
individual, combined with too few gains (e.g., lack of necessary tools for work meaning that 
work cannot be carried out as intended). This lack of return on investment results in 
individuals being cautious with future resource investment in the same situation. This may 
manifest as subsequent pulling away from patients or developing negative attitudes towards 
patients (Halbesleben et al., 2008). 
An alternate explanation is found in biological processes. Stress, depression, and 
burnout can cause physical and emotional fatigue, reducing cognitive functioning skills, 
including decision-making, memory, and attention (Linden et al., 2005; Hammar & Årdal, 2009; 
Burt et al., 1995). Therefore, stressed workers are more likely to make poorer decisions and 
judgements (Hall et al., 2017), and to rely on heuristics and cognitive biases. These informalise 
decision-making processes and may make errors more likely (Burt et al., 1995).  
  
Staff Wellbeing, Burnout and Sickness Absence and Turnover Rates 
Sickness absence. Numerous studies indicate that sickness absence from work is 
higher in the public sector than in the private sector, internationally (Uppal & LaRochelle-Cote, 
2013; ONS, 2017; BLS, 2017). This difference is further pronounced when healthcare 
employees are considered apart from other public sector employees. In the UK, staff in the 
healthcare sector take twice the number of sick days as those in the private sector, and around 
25% more than staff in other public sector organisations (ONS, 2017).  In the USA, workers in 
healthcare support occupations take the most sickness absence of all employees, with rates 
50% higher than private sector employees (BLS, 2017). Furthermore, as discussed above, the 
absence rate of mental health care staff outstrips other healthcare sectors (Figure 2). Notably, 
a higher proportion of these sick days are attributed to anxiety, stress, depression or other 
psychiatric illness. From December 2014-November 2015, 26% of all absence days in UK 
mental health doctors were in this category, compared to 17% in doctors in acute trusts 
(NHSDigital, 2017). In mental health nurses, 25% of absences were also stress or anxiety 
related, compared with 18% in acute trust nurses (NHSDigital, 2017).  
These unplanned absences are costly; where workers are not replaced they result in 
lost productivity and where workers are replaced, the effective hourly cost is usually higher 
than that of the absent worker. In front-line acute healthcare, required staffing levels usually 
mean the latter option is applied. This has been a particular problem in the UK, where 
concerns about the inflated rates charged by staffing agencies have resulted in the 
introduction of locum staff expenditure caps in the NHS. Despite this cap, many doctors in the 
UK are continuing to choose locum work over substantive positions as it provides more control 
and is less stressful (Cheshire et al., 2017). This further adds to the shortage of healthcare staff 
 and exacerbates current staffing level issues. However, research is yet to explore these factors 
within mental healthcare locums.  
 
Burnout is a risk factor for higher absence rates. A study of 3368 Finnish employees 
found that physical illness was more common in burnt-out employees than others, and the 
prevalence of diseases increased with increasing severity of burnout (Honkonen et al., 2006). 
Strong evidence suggests that this translates into greater sickness rates, with numerous 
studies identifying a prospective link between higher burnout and subsequently greater rates 
of sickness absence (Borritz et al., 2006; Schaufeli et al., 2009; Firth & Britton, 1989). In 3151 
Finnish employees, the risk of taking a sickness absence longer than 9 days was 6.9-fold higher 
in participants with severe burnout, even when mental and physical health problems were 
adjusted for (Ahola et al., 2008). 
A large proportion of research in this area has focused on general healthcare staff 
(Peterson et al., 2011; Firth & Britton, 1989; Anagnostopoulos & Niakas, 2010). A smaller 
number of studies have been conducted in mental healthcare staff, with results reflecting 
those in other occupational groups. For example, one study comparing three groups of ward-
based mental health nurses found that the group reporting the highest levels of emotional 
exhaustion and depersonalisation also reported the highest sickness absence rates (Fagin et 
al., 1996). More recently, a study of 475 UK mental health nurses found a significant 
association between increases in emotional exhaustion and number of sickness absence days 
taken (Sherring & Knight, 2009).  
Turnover. Staff turnover and absenteeism are directly linked. In the USA, a report 
found that workplaces with higher absenteeism also had higher turnover (Aguirre & Kerin, 
2004). In a meta-analysis assessing the strength of the absenteeism-turnover association, 
Berry et al. (2012) found evidence of a significant correlation between the two variables. 
Annual  turnover in general nurses ranges from 15-44%, (Duffield et al., 2014), similar to other 
 industries (Bingley & Westergaard-Nielsen, 2004; Siebert & Zubanov, 2009), but turnover in 
mental healthcare is higher, ranging from 28-52% (Glisson et al., 2006; Glisson & James, 2002; 
Aarons & Sawitzky, 2006; Prosser et al., 1999).  One study of 42 mental healthcare teams over 
24 months reported a mean turnover rate of 81% (Woltmann et al., 2008).  
Turnover is costly, necessitating temporary replacement cover, recruitment and 
training of new staff. Estimates of costs for nurses lost and replaced are (per nurse) $20,561 in 
the USA, $26,652 in Canada, $23,711 in New Zealand and $48,790 in Australia (Duffield et al., 
2014). High turnover also has a negative impact on service delivery, with mental healthcare 
studies linking it with poorer implementation of evidence-based practices (Woltmann et al., 
2008) and more patient suicides (Kapur et al., 2016). 
Similar to absenteeism, burnout is a consistent risk factor for higher turnover. 
Numerous studies report cross-sectional associations between burnout and turnover 
intentions in nurses (Spence Laschinger et al., 2009; Van Bogaert et al., 2014), doctors (Zhang 
& Feng, 2011), clinical managers (Wong & Laschinger, 2015) and ambulance personnel (Bria et 
al., 2013). Mental healthcare staff are no exception. In one study with 10,997 mental 
healthcare nurses, social workers, psychologists and psychiatrists, higher levels of emotional 
exhaustion were associated with higher turnover intention (Yanchus et al., 2016). These 
turnover intentions may translate into actual turnover. In nurses (Firth & Britton, 1989) and 
social welfare workers  (1998) higher burnout predicted likelihood of subsequent contract 
terminations. These findings are contentious, though. In a study of mental healthcare staff, 
Prosser et al. (1999) found that overall wellbeing (measuring using the General Health 
Questionnaire; Goldberg, 1978) predicted turnover for 12 months but burnout did not, and 
neither wellbeing nor burnout predicted turnover three years later. However, the absence of 
statistical significance in this study may stem from a lack of power and a high attrition rate; 
just 25 staff remained at the end.  
 Together, these studies suggest that reducing burnout and improving wellbeing in 
mental healthcare may improve patient care quality, reduce safety incidents and reduce costs 
incurred through staff sickness absence and high turnover rates. We will now review recent 
evidence regarding the effectiveness of burnout reduction interventions. 
Interventions for Preventing or Reducing Burnout  
 
Interventions targeting burnout can be categorised into those directed at individuals 
(person-directed) and those which take a wider, organisational approach (organisation-
directed). Person-directed interventions include psychological interventions such as cognitive-
behaviour therapy (CBT), mindfulness groups or counselling. Organisation-directed 
interventions include educational interventions, work scheduling changes and teamwork 
training. Interventions can be further divided into those which are preventative and those 
which are reactive (ameliorating existing burnout) (Firth-Cozens, 2001). This 
preventative/reactive division is rarely operationalised in practice; possibly due to lack of 
clarity regarding the difference. However, widespread high burnout levels may mean that all 
studies are defacto reactive. Interest in reducing burnout is growing; 2016 saw the publication 
of three separate meta-analyses of burnout reduction interventions in different groups of 
healthcare staff (Panagioti et al., 2016; West et al., 2016; Dreison et al., 2016).  
One of these meta-analyses focused on mental healthcare staff and identified 27 
relevant studies, of which around half were uncontrolled studies (n=14) and half were 
randomised controlled trials (n=13) (Dreison et al., 2016). Interventions included stress 
management workshops, psychological therapy, clinical supervision and team communication 
training. The majority of interventions were organisation directed (e.g., co-worker support 
groups; 70%), and the largest subtype of organisational interventions were job 
training/education interventions (44%). Their overall effect was small, with standardised mean 
differences ranging from .13 to.22, depending on time of measurement and study design. 
 Effects were greater when a second post-test measurement was used, and when studies used 
controlled designs. These findings are promising, suggesting that the impact of interventions is 
likely to be sustainable and robust in the face of higher quality evaluations. 
Interestingly, the meta-analysis found that person-directed interventions were more 
effective than organisational interventions for burnout reduction, and when they were 
considered in isolation, organisation directed interventions were not effective for reducing 
overall composite burnout scores. This finding contrasts with two recent meta-analyses of 
burnout interventions in doctors working in a range of settings, which found either no 
difference between these types of interventions (West et al., 2016) or that organisational 
interventions were more effective (Panagioti et al., 2016). Reasons for this divergence are 
unclear. One possibility is that compared with studies of organisational interventions, the 
person-directed interventions selected for, or attracted participants high in burnout, and their 
results were boosted due to regression-to-the-mean. This is supported by evidence that 
greater burnout reductions were observed in studies where participants reported higher 
baseline burnout (Dreison et al., 2016). However, explanation is hampered by poor reporting 
of recruitment and selection strategies. An alternative explanation lies with the type and 
components of organisational intervention, and grouping all organisational interventions 
together may obscure the true picture. Certainly when job training/education interventions 
were analysed separately from other organisational interventions, they had a significant 
impact on each type of burnout. Indeed, effect sizes were larger for job training/education 
interventions than person directed interventions for the outcomes of composite burnout (.21 v 
.17) and personal accomplishment/efficacy (.24 v -.09) (Dreison et al., 2016). Conversely, other 
forms of organisational interventions had no significant impact on any burnout outcome. 
Taken together, these findings suggest that job training interventions could be a promising 
avenue for reducing overall burnout and enhancing personal accomplishment, whilst person-
 directed interventions may be most effective for reducing emotional exhaustion, and other 
forms of organisational interventions such as support groups may be irrelevant for all burnout 
outcomes.  
 
Relevance for Clinical Practice 
 
Given reports of increasing burnout and stress in healthcare staff, staff leaving due to 
stress, and an amplification of these problems in mental healthcare providers, implementing 
burnout interventions in mental healthcare settings is imperative. However, when tested the 
impact of interventions has been minimal (Dreison et al., 2016). In an increasingly resource-
limited healthcare context, there is an urgent need to identify how interventions can be made 
more effective and therefore more cost-efficient. We outline four recommendations below 
which could advance burnout research and increase adoption by mental health services.  
1. Ground interventions in the research literature 
Burnout interventions are too often ad-hoc and based on anecdotal 
understandings of the causes of burnout and poor wellbeing in staff. Growing evidence 
reveals the underlying causes of burnout and should be used in the development of 
burnout interventions. For mental healthcare staff causes include poor staffing ratios, 
inadequate leadership support, the emotional demands of caring for suicidal or 
complex patients and lack of training (Graber et al., 2008; Willard-Grace et al., 2014; 
Pinikahana & Happell, 2004; Bressi et al., 2009; Hagen et al., 2017). These factors may 
explain the meta-analytic finding that organisational interventions focused on job 
training are more effective for reducing burnout in mental health care staff than other 
types of organisational interventions such as co-worker support groups (Dreison et al., 
2016). Whilst job training addresses one known cause of burnout: lack of training, co-
 worker support groups fail to target any known causes of mental healthcare staff 
burnout. Interventions which may prove effective for known burnout causes include i) 
increasing staffing levels, which would both improve staff-patient ratios, facilitate time 
for clinical supervision and training and give staff time to monitor patients at risk of 
self harm or suicide, ii) training in known areas of need, such as de-escalation of 
violence, reducing coercive practices, the management of self harm and suicide risk, iii) 
training managers in leadership skills, iv) effective supervision (White & Winstanley, 
2010), and v) improving support for staff after incidents have occurred (Goulet & 
Larue, 2016). Despite requiring initial investment from services, cost-savings from 
reduced rates of sickness absence due to stress and staff turnover are feasible; an 
argument that requires further research.  
2. Increase the value of interventions.  
Healthcare staff wellbeing and burnout is consistently associated with the quality 
and safety of care (Johnson et al., 2017a; Hall et al., 2016). However, the direction of 
this relationship is unclear and the two factors may operate as a feedback loop: higher 
staff wellbeing may lead to better quality and safety of care, but an inability to provide 
high quality, safe care may lead to disillusionment, stress and burnout (West et al., 
2009). As such, developing interventions which simultaneously reduce burnout and 
enhance quality could increase the value of interventions, meeting two objectives at 
once. Furthermore, the impact of these interventions may be longer-lasting, with 
enhanced staff wellbeing and the ability to provide higher-quality care acting in a 
mutually reinforcing, maintaining way.  
3. Build bridges between universities and healthcare organisations  
 Too often, University researchers work in isolation from mental health services. 
This may be pragmatic and practical: healthcare organisations operate in a faster-
paced context driven by urgent need to improve patient care, meet targets and work 
within stringent financial constraints, whereas universities work to different demands. 
Their time-frames for work are longer, in order to abide by lengthy research approval 
processes. They are expected to be scientifically rigorous and focus on research impact 
as well as (and not always) service-level improvements. Co-working offers advantages 
to both healthcare and academics. For healthcare practitioners, university researchers 
can review existing knowledge, identify novel solutions and develop rigorous plans for 
testing intervention effectiveness. They also have access to research journals, 
databases and specialist data analysis software that can support evidence gathering 
and intervention evaluation. For university researchers, partnering with healthcare 
organisations can offer opportunities to evaluate interventions already happening. 
Partnerships can help identify new and important avenues for research, ensuring that 
studies meet current service and patient needs and enhance the societal impact of 
results. In the UK, the exercise that assesses the quality of academic research (the 
Research Excellence Framework) now emphasises the importance of impact, and 
potential for impact is increasingly prominent in research funding calls. Furthermore, 
partnering with healthcare organisations can support access to research populations 
and increase credibility of bids in which clinical and service partnerships are positively

these partnerships on research outputs, to allow for the evaluation of their 
effectiveness and impact.  
 
 4. Engage healthcare staff by emphasising the positives 
Given that wellbeing exists on a spectrum from low to high wellbeing  (Johnson & 
Wood, 2017), it could be expected that interventions which reduce burnout will also 
offer positive benefits. This is supported by studies suggesting lower burnout is 
associated with variables such as higher job satisfaction (Baruch-Feldman et al., 2002; 
Weng et al., 2011; Griffin et al., 2010), life satisfaction (Hakanen & Schaufeli, 2012) and 
broader physical health outcomes, including risk of subsequent musculo-skeletal pain 
(Armon et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2011). Mackenzie and colleagues (2006) found a 
burnout intervention also improved other outcome variables. In a controlled test of a 
mindfulness intervention in nursing staff, reductions in burnout occured alongside 
improvements in relaxation and life satisfaction (Mackenzie et al., 2006). Similarly, in a 
more recent study of participants from a range of occupations, Hulsheger and 
colleagues (2013) reported that a mindfulness intervention resulted in concurrent 
reductions in emotional exhaustion alongside increases in job satisfaction in the 
intervention group . However, it should be noted that the outcome variables affected 
may vary according to the specific type of intervention delivered, and in a controlled 
test of an intervention involving a small-group curriculum covering topics such as 
���������� ������ ��� ��������� �� �������� �� ��� ����� ���� ������ ����������������� 
was reduced, no significant differences in quality of life, job satisfaction or stress were 
found (West et al., 2014).  
There is a perceived stigma associated with admitting poor mental health in 
healthcare staff. Fears that disclosure may cause career damage or put oneself on the 
radar of licensing or registering bodies exist and need acknowledging (Wallace et al., 
2009). This may be more pronounced in mental healthcare staff who fear being 
referred for treatment in a service which employs them and by staff who are also 
 colleagues. Burnout is a factor which is well known to co-occur with depression 
(Hakanen et al., 2008) and interventions which only emphasise the potential for 
burnout reduction may deter staff who are concerned about admitting to poor mental 
health. Instead, emphasising the potential additional benefits of these interventions in 
terms of increased job satisfaction, life satisfaction, relaxation and physical health may 
overcome this stigma and increase uptake of interventions by professionals. Framing 
������������� �� ����� �� ��� ����� ��������� �� ����� ������������ ��� ���� �� �������� 
given increasing awareness of the need to cope with a challenging and changing 
healthcare context (Johnson et al., 2017b). The literature on mindfulness interventions 
has often emphasised the potential positive gains of participation, which may partly 
explain its widespread appeal. We suggest that for burnout interventions to receive 
comparable interest and uptake in healthcare professionals, an increased emphasis 
upon and measurement of positive outcome variables may be necessary.  
 
Conclusion 
 
A growing body of research suggests poor wellbeing and burnout are increasing in 
healthcare staff. Staff in mental healthcare settings report higher rates than those in other 
healthcare sectors. This harms the quality and safety of patient care delivered and increases 
service costs because stress and burnout means higher rates of sickness absence and turnover. 
Recent syntheses suggest interventions can be effective for reducing burnout, but effect sizes 
in mental healthcare staff are small. Grounding interventions in the research literature, 
emphasising the positives of interventions to staff, building links between healthcare 
organisations and universities and designing interventions which target burnout and improve 
patient care together may serve to improve the effectiveness and uptake of interventions.
