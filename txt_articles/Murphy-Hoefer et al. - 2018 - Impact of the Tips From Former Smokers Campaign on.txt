Abstract
This study provides estimates of the long-term cumulative impact
of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s national to-
bacco education campaign, Tips From Former Smokers (Tips), on
population-level smoking cessation. We used recently published
estimates of the association between increased Tips campaign me-
dia doses and quit attempts to calculate campaign-attributable pop-
ulation sustained (6-month) quits during 2012–2015. Tips led to
approximately 522,000 sustained quits during 2012–2015. These
findings indicate that the Tips campaign’s comprehensive ap-
proach to combining evidence-based messages with the promo-
tion of cessation resources was successful in achieving substantial
long-term cigarette cessation at the population level over multiple
years.
Objective
Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable death, disease, and
disability in the United States, killing more than 480,000 Ameri-
can adults annually (1). Mass media campaigns are an evidence-
based intervention for promoting cigarette cessation (1). In 2012,
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) launched
the Tips From Former Smokers (Tips) mass media campaign, fea-
turing former smokers living with serious health effects from
smoking. Studies have demonstrated significant annual quit at-
tempts and cigarette cessation (2–4); however, no study has as-
sessed the campaign’s combined, multiyear impact. The objective
of this study was to assess the cumulative impact of Tips on sus-
tained (6-month) cigarette abstinence during the first 4 years of the
campaign’s implementation (2012–2015).
Methods
Published estimates of the association between Tips campaign
gross ratings points (GRPs, a measure of market-level campaign
dose) and increased quit attempts were used to calculate popula-
tion-level sustained quits attributable to the campaign. During
2012–2015, the campaign delivered an average 1,100 quarterly
GRPs, consistent with CDC’s Best Practices for Comprehensive
Tobacco Control Programs — 2014 (5). Davis and colleagues es-
timated that an average delivery of 1,000 Tips GRPs per quarter
was associated with an average 4.3 absolute percentage-point in-
crease in quit attempts among adult smokers (2); this estimate was
based on an analysis of a nationally representative online panel of
US smokers that was designed to detect the effect of 1,000 Tips
GRPs on quit attempts in the previous 3 months at approximately
89% power using 2-sided testing (2).
We combined data on previously estimated campaign effect size
with census data of the US adult population and National Health
Interview Survey (NHIS) estimates of adult cigarette smoking pre-
valence to derive quarterly population totals of smokers who at-
tempted to quit in association with each campaign phase. We then
multiplied the estimated increase in quarterly population quit at-
tempts associated with the campaign by the number of quarters the
Tips campaign was on air. This yielded an estimate of adjusted
total campaign-attributable quit attempts for each campaign phase.
To calculate campaign-attributable sustained quits, we used data
from Neff and colleagues (4), who estimated that 5.7% of smokers

 who attempted to quit in the previous 3 months remained abstin-
ent from cigarettes in 3 subsequent follow-up surveys spanning
approximately 6 months. We chose this quit rate because it was
derived from the same data used to estimate the primary Tips cam-
paign effects (2). Thus, each estimate of additional campaign-at-
tributable quit attempts was multiplied by 5.7% to yield total cam-
paign-attributable sustained quits during 2012–2015. We calcu-
lated upper-bound and lower-bound estimates of campaign-attrib-
utable sustained quits based on the lower and upper ranges of
CDC’s Best Practices recommendations for quarterly dosing of to-
bacco education advertising (800 and 1,200 GRPs, respectively)
(5).
Results
During 2012–2015, the Tips campaign was associated with ap-
proximately 9.15 million total additional quit attempts among the
US smoker population (Table). Based on the assumed 5.7% cigar-
ette abstinence rate among quit attempters, this translates into ap-
proximately 522,000 campaign-attributable sustained quits during
2012–2015.
The campaign would have generated a minimum of approxim-
ately 461,000 and a maximum of roughly 571,000 sustained quits
had the campaign been delivered at the lower and upper bounds of
CDC-recommended media dosing (800 and 1,200 quarterly GRPs,
respectively).
Discussion
Our study found that CDC’s Tips campaign was associated with
more than a half-million sustained quits among US adult smokers
during 2012–2015. These findings indicate that the Tips cam-
paign’s comprehensive approach to combining evidence-based
messages with the promotion of cessation resources, such as
1–800-QUIT-NOW quitline information and other resources on
the campaign’s website, was successful in achieving substantial
long-term cigarette cessation at the population level over multiple
years. These findings are consistent with the growing body of sci-
entific literature demonstrating the Tips campaign’s impact on in-
creased calls to quitlines (8,9), knowledge of tobacco-related
health risks (10,11), ability to serve various groups (ie, groups that
differ by race/ethnicity, educational attainment, and mental health
status) equally well (2), and cessation-related information seeking,
including visits to the campaign’s website (12). Taken as a whole,
these studies reinforce the importance of sustained, evidence-
based mass-reach public education cessation campaigns as an ef-
fective way of encouraging smokers to quit (1).
The estimates of campaign-attributable sustained quits in this
study are likely conservative given the use of a previously pub-
lished effect size of a 4.3 percentage-point increase in quit at-
tempts  per  1,000  quarterly  campaign  GRPs  (2).  The  actual
quarterly delivery of the campaign was slightly higher during its
implementation (approximately 1,100 GRPs per quarter), but we
found no published effect size for this dose level. In addition, a re-
latively conservative, but recent, estimate of sustained quitting
(5.7%) was used (4), although previous research found higher
long-term cigarette abstinence rates (up to 9.0%) from tobacco
control policy or clinical interventions (13).
This analysis has several limitations. First, it relies on a single
overall average campaign effect estimated during the campaign
timeframe (2012–2015). The actual campaign effect may have
varied across years, although previous research did not find signi-
ficant evidence of variation in effects by year (2). Second, the es-
timated sustained quit-rate measures sustained quitting over a 6-
month period; it is possible that a percentage of sustained quitters
may still relapse. Third, the study captured only the effects of the
television component of the campaign, not other smaller cam-
paign components such as billboards, radio, and digital advert-
ising (2); thus, the estimated campaign effect size would be expec-
ted to be greater if these other components were included.
Our study is the first to place the existing scientific evidence base
of CDC’s Tips campaign’s effectiveness in a broader context of
multiyear population impact on smoking cessation. Our findings
indicate that the campaign may have motivated more than a half-
million successful quits among smokers, thus contributing to the
decline in US adult cigarette smoking observed during this period
(14). This finding underscores the critical role of national tobacco
education campaigns as a counterpoint to the substantial pro-to-
bacco advertising and promotion that persists in the United States
(1). Evidence of the effectiveness of the Tips campaign over mul-
tiple years reinforces the importance of continued use of evidence-
based, national tobacco cessation media campaigns to further re-
duce tobacco use and tobacco-related disease and death.
