Gene correction in human long-term hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs) could be an
effective therapy for monogenic diseases of the blood and immune system. Here we describe
an approach for X-linked sSevere cCombined iImmunodeficiency (SCID-X1) using targeted
integration of a cDNA into the endogenous start codon to functionally correct disease-
causing mutations throughout the gene. Using a CRISPR-Cas9/AAV6 based strategy, we
achieve up to 20% targeted integration frequencies in LT-HSCs. As measures of the lack of
toxicity we observe no evidence of abnormal hematopoiesis following transplantation and no
evidence of off-target mutations using a high-fidelity Cas9 as a ribonucleoprotein complex.
We achieve high levels of targeting frequencies (median 45%) in CD34+ HSPCs from six
SCID-X1 patients and demonstrate rescue of lymphopoietic defect in a patient derived HSPC
population in vitro and in vivo. In sum, our study provides specificity, toxicity and efficacy
data supportive of clinical development of genome editing to treat SCID-Xl.

 X
-linked sSevere cCombined iImmunodeficiency (SCID-
X1) is a primary immune deficiency disorder (PID) caused
by mutations in the IL2RG gene on the X chromosome.
The gene encodes a shared subunit of the receptors for
interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15, and IL-21. Without
early treatment, affected male infants die in the first year of life
from infections. Although allogeneic hematopoietic cell trans-
plant (allo-HCT) is considered the standard of care for SCID-X1,
it holds significant risks due to potential incomplete immune
reconstitution, graft versus host disease (GvHD) and a decreased
survival rate in the absence of an human leukocyte antigen
(HLA)-matched sibling donor1. Because of the selective advan-
tage of lymphoid progenitors expressing normal IL2RG, however,
only a small number of genetically corrected hematopoietic stem
and progenitor cells (HSPCs) are needed to reconstitute T-cell
immunity2,3. The importance of achieving gene correction in
long-term hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs) to achieve sus-
tained clinical benefit is demonstrated by the waning of a func-
tional immune system in patients who do not derive their
immune system from LT-HSCs with a wild-type IL2RG gene.
Gene therapy is an alternative therapy to allo-HSCT. Using
integrating viral vectors, such as gamma-retroviral and lentiviral
vectors, extra copies of a functional IL2RG gene are semi-
randomly integrated into the genome of SCID-X1 patient-derived
CD34+ HSPCs. This strategy has resulted in both successes and
setbacks. While most patients treated with first generation of gene
therapy survived and benefited from the therapy, a substantial
fraction (>25%) of patients developed leukemia from insertional
oncogenesis4–6. It is concerning that patients developed leukemia
from insertional oncogenesis both early and late, 15 years after
transplantation of retroviral-based engineered cells7. Constitutive
activation of the transgene8, the choice of vectors9 and specific
details of the gene therapy procedure have all been proposed as
factors contributing to the risk of leukemia and myelodysplastic
syndrome that occurred in several trials for primary immuno-
deficiency disorders (PIDs) including SCID-X110,11, chronic
granulomatous disease (CGD)12,13 and Wiskott–Aldrich Syn-
drome (WAS)14. With second-generation self-inactivating (SIN)
vectors, multiple SCID-X1 patients have successfully recon-
stituted T-cell immunity in the absence of early leukemic
events15–17 with a follow-up of up to 7 years. However, the
follow-up of these therapies remains too short to assess the long-
term genotoxicity risk of the newer generation vectors, as trans-
formation of T cells growth can take >10 years to manifest7.
An alternative to the semi-random delivery of the com-
plementary DNA (cDNA) is to use a targeted genome editing
(GE) approach. GE is a means to alter the DNA sequence of a cell,
including somatic stem cells, with nucleotide precision. Using
homologous recombination-mediated GE (HR-GE), the approach
can target a cDNA transgene into its endogenous locus, thereby
preserving normal copy number and upstream and downstream
non-coding elements that regulate expression18–20. The highest
frequencies of GE are achieved using an engineered nuclease to
create a site-specific double-strand break (DSB) in the cell’s
genomic
DNA21,22.
When
the DSB
is
repaired
by
non-
homologous end joining (NHEJ), small insertions and deletions
(INDELs) can be created at a specific genomic target site—an
outcome that is not generally useful for correcting mutant
genes23,24. In contrast, when the DSB is repaired by either HR
(using a classic gene-targeting donor vector) or by single-stranded
template
repair
(using
a
single-stranded
oligonucleotide
(ssODN)), precise sequence changes can be introduced, thereby
providing a method to precisely revert disease-causing DNA
variants25.
Among the multiple GE platforms that use artificial nucleases
to
generate
DSBs18,26–29,
the
CRISPR-Cas9
system
has
accelerated the field of GE because of its ease of use and high
activity in a wide variety of cells. When CRISPR-Cas9 is delivered
into primary human cells, including human CD34+ HSPCs as a
ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex using fully synthesized single-
guide RNA molecules (sgRNAs) with end modifications to pro-
tect the guide from exonuclease degradation, high frequencies of
INDELs are achieved30. Moreover, when the delivery of an RNP
complex is combined with delivery of the gene-targeting donor
molecule in a recombinant AAV6 (rAAV6) viral vector, high
frequencies of homologous-mediated editing in human HSPCs
are obtained25. The use of rAAV6 donor vectors have been suc-
cessfully used with other nuclease systems as well, including zinc-
finger nucleases (ZFNs) and in other cell types, such as primary
human T cells19,31,32. Therefore, this HR-GE approach could
transform the semi-random nature of viral-based gene therapy to
a more controlled and precise strategy. By using AAV6 as a
classic gene-targeting donor, in contrast to ssODNs, a full cDNA
can be introduced at the endogenous target.
The key challenges in translating GE into medical therapies is
attaining clinically relevant targeted integration frequencies into
LT-HSCs, attaining functional levels of protein expression, and
establishing lack of toxicity derived from the GE approach.
Here, we describe a clinically relevant, selection-free “uni-
versal”
CRISPR-Cas9-rAAV6
GE
methodology
that
could
potentially correct >97% of known IL2RG pathogenic mutations.
We call this approach “functional gene correction” because it is
not directly correcting a mutation but instead is doing so by using
the targeted integration of cDNA to functionally correct down-
stream mutations. Approximately 2–3% of patients with deletions
of the gene could not be functionally corrected using this strategy.
We demonstrate that a functional, codon-optimized IL2RG
cDNA can be precisely and efficiently integrated at the endo-
genous translational start site in CD34+ HSPCs of healthy male
donors (HD, n = 13) or SCID-X1 patients (n = 6) at comparable
frequencies (median HR = 45%) in both peripheral blood (PB)-
derived and umbilical cord blood (CB)-derived CD34+ HSPCs.
We demonstrate the functionality of the full-length codon-opti-
mized IL2RG cDNA by showing that T cells with the cDNA
knock-in (KI) retain normal proliferation and signaling response
to cytokines. Using transplantation into immunodeficient (NSG)
mice, we show that process is both effective (with functional
correction of 10–20% of LT-HSCs) and safe (no evidence of
abnormal hematopoiesis). The in vivo functional results are based
on transplantation of ~21 million IL2RG targeted healthy donor
CD34+ HSPCs and ~7 million IL2RG targeted SCID-Xl-HSPCs.
We demonstrate high levels of CD34+ LT-HSC targeted cDNA
integration (10–20%) by showing multi-lineage hematopoiesis
derived from these cells using serial transplantation in immu-
nodeficient mice. These results match and exceed the predicted
therapeutic threshold determined through a mouse model19.
Finally, we show no evidence of significant genotoxicity as
demonstrated by next-generation sequencing (NGS) and kar-
yotype analysis. Together, this study establishes a pre-clinical
proof-of-concept for a safe, precise, and highly efficient GE
strategy to potentially cure SCID-X1.
Results
Gene correction strategy for IL2RG locus in CD34+ HSPCs.
SCID-X1 is caused by pathogenic mutations spanning the entire
IL2RG gene. Therefore, we developed a gene-targeting strategy by
integrating a complete cDNA at the endogenous IL2RG transla-
tional start site (Fig. 1a, central panel) that would correct the vast
majority (~97%) of known SCID-X1 pathogenic mutations and
ensure regulated endogenous expression in CD34+ HSPCs
derived progeny. By achieving efficient integration frequencies in

 the genome of CD34+ LT-HSCs, our approach could ensure life-
long therapeutic benefits for the patient (Fig. 1a, right schematic).
We screened seven different sgRNAs (single guide RNAs) for
activity in exon 1 of the IL2RG gene (Supplementary Fig. 1a) and
selected sg-1, previously described30, as the best candidate
because of the location of the DSB it creates (one nucleotide
downstream from the translational start site), on-target INDEL
frequencies (92.9% ± 0.6, mean ± s.e.m) (Supplementary Fig. 1b)
and for high cellular viability >80% (Supplementary Fig. 1c). We
found that a truncated sgRNA33 of 19 nucleotides (19 nt) gave
>90% INDEL frequencies (equivalent to the full 20 nt sgRNA)
(Supplementary Figs. 1–3). NGS (Supplementary Fig. 1e) further
corroborated the INDELs obtained by TIDE analysis34. We used
the 19 nt gRNA at a medium scale process (1 million cells per
electroporation) throughout the remaining experiments.
We designed a codon-optimized IL2RG cDNA functional
correction donor with homology arms centered on the sg-1 guide
sequence and cloned into an AAV6 vector both with and without
a selectable marker (truncated nerve growth factor receptor
(tNGFR) driven by the Ubiquitin C promoter (Supplementary
Figs. 4a, b) (Fig. 1b, top panel). The efficiency of genome targeting
integration was determined in both frozen mobilized PB (mPB)

 and in freshly isolated CB-derived CD34+ HSPCs from healthy
male donors (Fig. 1b). We observed a median gene-targeting
frequency of 23.2% (range 9.9–45.0%) for the +tNGFR donor
and 45.0% (range 24.7–60.0%) for the –tNGFR IL2RG donor
(Fig. 1b, bottom panel), as measured by Digital Droplet Droplet
Digital PCR (ddPCR) (Supplementary Figs. 5a–f). As the
selection-free cassette gave high frequencies of targeted integra-
tion, we concluded that a selection marker was not necessary
because it would create a simpler cell manufacturing process for
cells that would also have a selective advantage.
To determine the myeloerythroid differentiation potential of
IL2RG cDNA genome targeted CD34+ HSPCs, we performed
methylcellulose assays. After Cas9/gRNA-rAAV6-CRISPR-Cas9-
AAV6 based IL2RG cDNA targeting, HSPCs were single-cell
plated in a 96-well methylcellulose plates and scored for colony
formation at day 14. Although the number of colonies was
reduced by ~35% in IL2RG cDNA targeted samples compared
with mock-targeted HSPCs (where neither the sgRNA nor the
donor were introduced) (Fig. 1c), the distribution of types of
colony-forming units (CFUs) was the same from IL2RG cDNA
targeted HSPCs and mock-targeted HSPCs, including CFU-
GEMMs (granulocytes, erythrocytes, monocytes, megakaryo-
cytes), without any lineage skewing (Fig. 1d). Genotyping of
colonies confirmed that IL2RG cDNA targeted derived-colonies
(n = 344) showed an overall targeting frequency of 45.7% ± 2.4
(mean ± s.e.m.) (Supplementary Fig. 6). Bi-allelic modification is
not relevant as the cells were derived from male donors and have
a single X chromosome. In sum, the in vitro differentiation assay

 of targeted IL2RG cDNA CD34+ HSPCs demonstrated no
perturbation of the myeloerythroid differentiation potential.
To assess the hematopoietic differentiation potential of the
codon-optimized IL2RG cDNA donor, we used the OP9-idll1
stromal cell line in vitro system. In this system, a lentiviral vector
confers the doxycycline (DOX)-inducible expression of the Notch
ligand Dll35. In the presence of a cocktail of cytokines permissive
for myeloerythroid and lymphoid differentiation, multi-potent
human CD34+ HSPCs will generate only myeloerythroid and B-
cell lineage before induction of dll1 expression, but becomes
permissive for T and NK-cell generation in the same well after
addition of DOX to induce dll1 expression. CD34+ HSPCs
derived from frozen mPB of SCID-X1 patient (delA;M145fs—
patient 2) were gene targeted (functionally corrected) using the
CRISPR-Cas9-AAV6 platform. The total number of cells per well
derived from the IL2RG cDNA targeted cells was markedly
increased, compared with that of mutant cells, indicating a
growth dependence on functional IL-7 and IL-15 receptors, for
which IL2RG is an essential subunit36. Following DOX-mediated
dll1 expression, no further growth of mutant CD34+ HSPCs was
detected on OP9-idll1 stromal cells. In contrast, the IL2RG cDNA
targeted cells continued to expand in myeloerythroid compart-
ment in addition to the development of B (CD19+), T (CD3
+CD56-), NK (CD3−CD56+), and TNK (CD3+CD56+) pro-
geny progenitors (Fig. 1e, Supplementary Fig. 7). The OP9-idll1
in vitro system is known to generate more CD3+CD4+ over CD3
+CD8+ cells expressing cell surface markers37. A CD3+CD56+
(TNK cell) population was generated from our genome corrected
SCID-X1 patient-derived CD34+ HSPCs further demonstrating
the range of lymphoid reconstition that can arise following
ex vivo gene editing correction of the IL2RG gene from patient-
derived cells38. These experiments demonstrate the functional
correction of the IL2RG gene from patient-derived CD34+
HSPCs necessary for lymphoid development.
Hematopoietic reconstitution from IL2RG cDNA targeted
HSPCs. To further assess the toxicity and efficacy of our HR-GE
system, we evaluated the in vivo engraftment and multi-lineage
hematopoietic reconstitution of IL2RG cDNA targeted HSPCs
in immunodeficient NSG mice. Following ~4 days of ex vivo
manufacturing, IL2RG cDNA targeted and different control cells
were transplanted either by intra-hepatic (IH) injection into sub-
lethally irradiated 3- to 4-day-old NSG pups or by intra-femoral
(IF) injection into 6- to 8-week-old NSG mice. The IH system has
previously been shown to be superior for assessment of human
lymphopoiesis39. An experimental schema is shown (Fig. 2a,
primary engraftment panel). For primary engraftment studies, a
total of 19.3 million cells, derived from three different healthy
male CB CD34+ HSPCs were transplanted into a total of 47 mice
(Fig. 2b). The kinetics of primary human engraftment was
monitored at weeks 8 and 12 in bone marrow (BM) aspirates and
PB samples. At week 16, end point analysis was carried out on
total BM, spleen (SP), and PB samples. High human engraftment
levels - as shown by hCD45+ HLA-ABC+ double positive
staining, blue/black circles – were obtained with no statistical
difference between the IL2RG cDNA targeted and control
cells — WT, mock, or RNP (Fig. 2b, Supplementary Figs. 8, 9).
Transplanted IL2RG targeted HSPCs showed a median human
engraftment level of 45% in BM (n =24), 28% in SP (n = 24), and
6% in PB (n = 24) (Fig. 2b). The targeted integration frequency of
the IL2RG cDNA was 25.5% in BM (n = 24), 44.8% in SP (n =
24), and 56% in PB (n = 6) at week 16 post engraftment (Fig. 2c).
Multi-lineage reconstitution was achieved from both mock and
IL2RG cDNA targeted cells in both the BM and SP samples of
transplanted mice (Fig. 3a).
In human cells not targeted with the cDNA correction cassette,
the frequency of INDELs was >90% in the IH engrafted IL2RG
targeted cells at weeks 8, 12, and 16 with an INDEL spectrum
of +1, −11, and −13 (all inactivating mutations) (Supplementary
Fig. 10). In sum, the engraftment of selection-free IL2RG cDNA
targeted CD34+ HSPCs derived from healthy male donors
demonstrate the ability to give rise to normal hematopoiesis. As
>90% of the non-gene targeted human cells have inactivating
INDELs in the Il2RG gene, it is likely that the T and NK cells seen
in the mice are derived from gene targeted CD34+ HSPCs. The
paucity of these cells in the mice, however, precluded definitive
molecular analysis.

 function in patients. We performed secondary transplantation
studies to assess the robustness of our CRISPR-Cas9-AAV6
genome targeting platform in editing LT-HSCs. CD34+ HSPCs
were isolated from total BM of IL2RG cDNA targeted HSPCs
(from both primary IH or IF engraftments at week 16). Following
overnight culturing, secondary transplants were carried out in
sub-lethally irradiated 6- to 8-week-old NSG mice (Fig. 2a). At
16 weeks following the secondary transplant, end point analy-
sis — totaling 32 weeks of engraftment into immunodeficient
mice — a median human chimerism level (hCD45+/ HLA-ABC+
double positive cells) of IL2RG cDNA targeted cells ranged from
7.7% to 13.8% (BM) and 6.1% to 11.4% (SP) (Fig. 2d). The
median targeted integration frequencies of the IL2RG cDNA
donor was 9.5% or 20% (BM) and 16.4% or 21.7% (SP) (Fig. 2e).
Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) plots showing BM
human engraftment levels from mice injected with cells derived
from both conditions are shown (Supplementary Figs. 11, 12).
Analysis in secondary transplants showed multi-lineage hema-
topoietic reconstitution with no evidence of abnormal hemato-
poiesis thus providing further evidence of efficacy and safety
(Fig. 3c).
A summary of the IL2RG cDNA targeted engrafted cells is
shown in Tables 1 and 2. We report that 20 and 9.5% of human
cells in the BM derived from IH-IF and IF-IF secondary
xenotransplantation experiments, respectively, retain the codon-
optimized IL2RG cDNA donor integration, demonstrating a
clinically significant level of correction of CD34+ LT-HSCs.
Moreover, our median frequencies of IL2RG cDNA targeted in
LT-HSCs significantly exceeds those reported by other groups,
notably Genovese et al.20 (ZFNs), Schiroli et al.19 (ZFNs), and
Dever et al.25 (Cas9 RNP) where the percent of HR-GE cells was
<5% of the human cells engrafted. These results, therefore,
represent the first evidence of high frequencies of HR-GE in LT-
HSCs using the CRISPR-Cas9 system. No tumors or abnormal
hematopoiesis were observed in any mice that were transplanted
with genome-modified cells (RNP or IL2RG cDNA targeted).
Collectively, our primary and secondary transplantation results
validate the robustness, effectiveness and lack of genotoxicity of
our IL2RG cDNA genome targeting approach and strongly
supports its advancement towards clinical translation.
In vivo rescue of lymphopoiesis. We investigated whether our
gene-targeting approach was reproducible and efficient in SCID-
X1 patient-derived CD34+ HSPCs. We edited CD34+ HSPCs
from six different SCID-X1 patients with a variety of different
pathologic mutations (Fig. 4a). Five of the six samples were PB-
derived CD34+ HSPCs. We achieved high viability (>80%, n = 5)
with the CRISPR-Cas9-AAV6 system in the patient-derived cells
and high gene-targeting (median 44.5 with range of 30.1– 47.0%,
n = 6), a frequency comparable to healthy donor CD34+HSPCs
(45%, n = 13) (Figs. 4b, c). A total of 7.3 million edited CD34+
HSPCs derived from patients 1, 2, and 3 were engrafted into 29
NSG pups. Human chimerism was measured at week 16 fol-
lowing IH engraftment, with no statistically significant differences
between unmodified and IL2RG cDNA targeted cells, both in the
BM and SP samples obtained from mice transplanted with SCID-
X1 patients 1 and 2 derived CD34+ HSPCs (Fig. 4e and Sup-
plementary Fig. 13). A statistically significant difference was
observed only in BM samples derived from SCID-X1 patient 3
engraftment (**p = 0.0073, Holm–Sidak test) (Supplementary
Fig. 13). Importantly, only the codon-optimized IL2RG cDNA
(not mutant allele) was detected in the SP of mice (n = 8)
engrafted with SCID-Xl patient 2 corrected CD34+ HSPCs
(Table 3), consistent with the survival advantage that a cell with a
corrected IL2RG gene has. Multi-lineage analysis of SP samples

significant levels of erythroid, myeloid, and lymphoid lineages
were established (Figs. 4e, f). Gene corrected cells from both
patients 1 and 3 showed high levels of engraftment following
transplantation in both BM and SP (Supplementary Fig. 13). This

 as demonstrated by multi-lineage reconstitution both in vitro and
in vivo. We observed no abnormal hematopoiesis in mice
transplanted with HR-GE patient-derived cells providing further
evidence for the safety of the process.
Signaling and proliferation of IL2RG cDNA targeted T cells.
To assess the receptor function and signaling in progenitor cells
in which the gene is express through the targeted integration of
a codon-optimized cDNA into the translational start site of the
endogenous locus, we evaluated the proliferation and signaling
activity of HR-GE human T lymphocytes derived from adult
healthy male donors. Mature T cells depend on proper IL2RG
expression and signaling through IL2RG-containing receptors,
e.g., IL-2R, to promote proliferation and differentiation40.

 induction of IL-2 cytokine, which in turn signals though the IL-
2R. Subsequent phosphorylation of tyrosine residues on the
cytoplasmic domains of the receptors initiates a cascade of
events that phosphorylate and activate the signaling transducers
and activators of transcription 5 (STAT5) proteins. Therefore,
we assessed the levels of pSTAT5 in IL2RG cDNA targeted
T cells, where the IL2RG cDNA donor contained tNGFR
selectable marker (Fig. 5a). Intracellular staining for pSTAT5
from IL2RG cDNA targeted T cells (Fig. 5b) and levels of
pSTAT5 (ratio of tNGFR+pSTAT5+ double-positive cells to
that of tNGFR+ only cells, marked red) was demonstrated to be
comparable to that of unmodified normal T cells 69.3 ± 7.0 vs
67.7 ± 4.4 (mean ± s.e.m.), respectively (Fig. 5c). As expected,
knocking-out (KO) the IL2RG locus with an IL2RG targeted
donor expressing only tNGFR, significantly reduced the levels
of pSTAT5 (12.7 ± 5.6; mean ± s.e.m.) (Fig. 5b). We analyzed
the MFI of the pSTAT5 level in WT, KI, and KO cells (Fig. 5c)
and found that the KO cells had an extremely low pSTAT5 MFI
(as expected), whereas the KI cells had pSTAT5 MFI (mean
fluorescence intensity) that was ~50% of the wild-type cells.
This lower signaling did not compromise lymphocyte devel-
opment (Figs. 1–4) nor proliferation (Fig. 5d). The KI cells did
not have higher signaling, which has been hypothesized as a
risk factor for transformation.

 To demonstrate that the genome edited IL-2R is permissive for
proliferation upon engagement of IL-2 cytokine, we quantified
the levels of proliferation of IL2RG cDNA targeted T-cell
following T-cell receptor (TCR) stimulation. A carboxyfluores-
cein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) dilution assay was used to
measure whether targeted insertion of the codon-optimized
cDNA could support T-cell proliferation. Loss of CFSE signal
occurs when cells proliferate as the dye dilutes from cell division.
An overview of the assay is shown (Fig. 5a). In our experimental
settings, we observed similar proliferation profile in tNGFR+
T cells (marking cells in which the IL2RG cDNA had been KI)
compared with mock-targeted cells (Fig. 5e). We note that the
“unmodified” cells had not undergone prior bead stimulation and
so remained quiescent while the targeted and mock cells had
undergone prior bead stimulation and thus there was residual
proliferation without re-stimulation in those cells giving the
broader peak. Overall, our data demonstrate that the genomic
integration of an IL2RG codon diverged cDNA at the start site of
the endogenous locus preserves normal signaling and prolifera-
tion of human T cells.
Off-target and karyotype analysis. We investigated the specifi-
city of the dsDNA break generated by the CRISPR–Cas9 RNP
complex, which could be a potential source of genotoxicity. The
off-target activity of the full-length 20 nt and three truncated
versions (19 nt, 18 nt, and 17 nt) of sg-1 guide were assessed at 54
different potential sites predicted by either Guide-Seq in U20S
cells41 or bioinformatically COSMID42 (Fig. 6a). The analysis was
performed in both healthy (Fig. 6a) and patient-derived CD34+
HSPCs (Fig. 6b) to assess the specificity of the sg-1 gRNA. At the
three sites identified by Guide-Seq analysis, there was no evidence
of off-target INDELs. In the 51 sites identified by COSMID, only
two showed evidence of off-target INDELs, both at levels <1%
(Fig. 6a). We detected INDEL frequencies using the 20 nt sg-1 of
0.59%, in an intron of myelin protein zero-like 1(MPZL1), a cell
surface receptor gene involved in signal transduction processes.
The 19 nt sg-1 induced a lower frequency of off-target INDELs
0.11% (Fig. 6a and Table 4). We also analyzed the INDEL fre-
quencies of potential off-target sites in genome edited CD34+
HSPCs derived from SCID-Xl patient 1 in which the cells were
edited using the 19 nt sg-1 (Fig. 6b). We found INDEL fre-
quencies of 0.08% at MPZL1 and 0.27% at the ZNF330 site
(intergenic and >9 kb from the nearby gene, respectively)
(Table 4). Off-target activities of sg-1 guides, WT (20 nt) and
truncated (19 nt), were further assessed in the context of a high-
fidelity (HiFi) Cas943 in SCID-X1 CD34+ HSPCs. The viability,
INDELs, and IL2RG cDNA targeting frequency (%HR) were all
equivalent (Fig. 6c) and editing frequencies (% INDELs) (Fig. 6d)
were comparable between WT and HiFi Cas9 (Figs. 6c–f). Using
the 20 nt and 19 nt gRNA combined with the HiFi Cas9, however,
resulted in no detectable INDELs (“background” Table 4) at the
two sites for which there was low but detectable INDEL frequency
using WT Cas9.
To further assess whether genomic instabilities, particularly
translocations, were generated by the - CRISPR-Cas9-AAV6 based
process, we performed karyotype analysis on CB-derived CD34+
HSPCs from healthy male donors. We chose to run karyotype
analysis over PCR-based translocation assays because we have
previously found that the frequency of translocations in CD34+
HSPCs when two on-target breaks (with INDEL frequencies of
>80%) was 0.2–0.5%44. The probability that there is a transloca-
tion between the on-target break and break that has an INDEL
frequency of <0.1% is exceedingly low. Whole chromosomal
analysis was performed on ≥20 cells from the different conditions
(WT, mock only, RNP only, AAV6 only and RNP+AAV6). The
analysis confirms absence of any chromosomal abnormalities in
20 out of 20 untreated or mock treated cells, 40 out of 40 RNP
only or RNP treated with rAAV6 cells, and from 40 out of 40 cells
treated with rAAV6 only (Supplementary Fig. 15). Finally, we
performed γH2AX and relative survival assays in K562 and
293T cells lines, respectively, to determine and compare the levels
of DNA damage and toxicity induced by ZFN, TALEN,
and CRISPR-Cas9 nucleases that all target the IL2RG gene
(Supplementary Fig. 16). The CCR5 ZFNs were first described in
Perez et al.45 and subsequently used to clinically and to modify
CD34+ HSPCs24,46,47. The nucleases targeting the IL2RG gene
were described previously in Urnov et al.26 (ZFNs) and Hendel
et al.48 (ZFNs, TALENs, and CRISPR-Cas9). The CRISPR-Cas9
nuclease generated the lowest levels of toxicity by showing fewer
γH2AX foci and higher percent survival of human cells
overexpressing each nuclease49 highlighting the notion that
standard TALEN and ZFN nuclease platforms are less specific
than CRISPR-Cas9.
In conclusion, our off-target analysis confirms that high
specificity and activity is achieved using the IL2RG CRISPR-
Cas9-AAV6 HR-GE system described here.
Discussion
Currently there are numerous GE-based clinical trials in USA and
China, none of which are for the treatment of PIDs (clinicaltrials.

 gov). There have been a number of proof-of-concept GE studies
to explore the feasibility and safety of using a HR-mediated
approach to correcting pathologic mutations in the IL2RG gene as
a path to developing an auto-HSPC-based therapy for SCID-
X119,20,26,50–54. In particular, a recent study by Schiroli et al.19, in
the process of developing a clinical translation GE for SCID-Xl in
CD34+ HSPCs, designed a ZFN GE-based platform to integrate a
full IL2RG cDNA at intron 1 delivered by integration-defective
lentiviral vector or rAAV6. They were able to generate ~40%
INDELs and ~10% HR frequencies in WT CD34+ HSPCs, with
targeted integration frequencies of ~25% in one SCID-Xl patient-
derived CB CD34+ HSPCs. Notably, Schiroli et al.19 performed
only one experiment combining CRISPR-Cas9 with AAV6 and
almost all of their data, including the engraftment data were from
ZFN-modified cells. Our work represents significant progress for
CRISPR-Cas9-based approaches as we not only demonstrate high
levels of engraftment of targeted cells in LT-HSCs (up to 20%), we
also demonstrate targeting efficiencies and engraftment of effi-
ciencies in patient-derived CD34+ HSPCs that exceed the LT-
HSC threshold of 10%. This high levels of genomic editing of LT-
HSCs has not been previously reported and demonstrates with
advances in technology, significant biologic improvements are
possible with clinically relevant quantitative metrics being met.
This level of correction is likely to be curative based on both
animal studies19, from patients who had spontaneous reversion
mutations in progenitor cells and from human gene therapy
clinical trials. In the gene therapy clinical trials for SCID-X1,
immune reconstitution was achieved with as little as 1% of the
cells having gene transfer3 or from vector copy numbers of only
0.1 in the blood2. Our results also show a lack of functional
toxicity from the CRISPR-Cas9-AAV6 procedure because LT-
HSCs were preserved and because normal human hematopoiesis
was obtained from the genome-edited cells.
In contrast to Dever et al.25, who also used a CRISPR-Cas9-
AAV6 system, in this work we were not simply making a single-
nucleotide correction but instead inserting a therapeutic trans-
gene in a precise genomic location while maintaining high tar-
geting efficiencies (median of 45% in CD34+ HSPCs and up to
20% in LT-HSCs). This targeted cDNA integration therapeutic
approach has the benefit of not only being able to correct >97% of
known SCID-X1 pathogenic mutations due to the “universal”
strategy design and thus should have broader application as most
genetic diseases are caused by mutations throughout the gene.
The safety of the approach is further supported by the lack of
karyotypic abnormalities generated in RNP exposed CD34+
HSPCs and by INDEL frequencies below the limit of detection
using a high-fidelity version of Cas9 at 54 potential off-target sites
identified by bioinformatics and cell-based methods. Even using
wild-type Cas9, off-target INDELs were only detected at two sites
(both at low frequencies (<0.3%)), which were at sites of no
known functional significance and did not result in any mea-
surable perturbations in the cell population in all the assays used
in this work the most important of which was no evidence of
abnormal hematopoiesis in RNP-treated cells. In the course of
these studies, we transplanted a full human dose for an infant (the
target age that we are planning to treat in a phase I/II clinical
trial) into NSG mice (28.4 million CD34+ HSPCs), a functional
safety standard that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
has used prior to approving a phase I clinical trial of ZFN editing
of CD34+ HSPCs24. The persistence of IL2RG gene corrected
cells for 8 months (16 weeks in the primary followed by 16 weeks
in the secondary recipient) following transplantation into NSG
mice with multi-lineage hematopoiesis and without evidence of
abnormal hematopoiesis also highlights the general lack of toxi-
city of the approach. An important aspect of our studies is that we
achieved a median correction frequency of 44.5% without
selection in PB patient-derived CD34+ HSPCs, a cell source that
is being used in lentiviral-based gene therapy trials. These func-
tionally gene corrected
CD34+ HSPCs showed equivalent
engraftment following transplantation into NSG mice as unma-
nipulated patient-derived CD34+ HSPCs, again providing data
that the GE manufacturing process was not damaging the cells in
a significant way.
We also demonstrated that the “universal” strategy of knocking
a codon-optimized wild-type cDNA into the endogenous start
site functionally rescues gene function using both in vitro and
in vivo assays of T and NK-cell development and function. These
results include the rescue of T and NK-cell development and
function from patient-derived CD34+ HSPCs. While the ultimate
test of the safety and efficacy of our approach will be established
during a gene therapy clinical phase I/II trial, we believe that we
have shown strong evidence using state-of-the-art, gold standard
methods of the safety and efficacy of the CRISPR-Cas9-AAV6
approach to targeting a cDNA to the endogenous translational
start site to functionally correct diseases causing mutations
throughout a gene. It is likely, however, that specific details of the
cDNA targeting strategy will have to be tailored to each gene in
order to achieve the safe and effective levels of expression that are
needed.
Our rationale for developing a GE-based gene therapy for
SCID-X1 is to provide a safe, efficient, precise, and effective
treatment option for patients. Although it is encouraging that
improved methods for allo-HSCT are being developed and that
the results using lentiviral-based gene therapy for SCID has been
shown to be safe and effective, the long-term safety, efficacy, and
limitations of these approaches remains to be determined. Thus,
it is important to continue develop alternative strategies for
curing patients with SCID-X1 using approaches that are less
genotoxic (the mutational burden from GE is >1000-fold less
than for lentiviral-based modification strategies by comparing the
frequency of off-target INDELs to the frequency of uncontrolled
lentiviral insertions). Ideally, multiple effective options will be
available for patients, their families, and their treating physicians
in the future thus giving them the opportunity to choose the
approach that best fits their needs and circumstances. In sum, the
safety and efficacy data presented in this study provides strong
support for the clinical development of functional gene correction
using the CRISPR-Cas9-AAV6 GE methodology to establish a
long lasting therapeutic, potentially curative, strategy beneficial to
>97% of SCID-X1 patients.
Methods
CRISPR-Cas9 sgRNA. Seven IL2RG, exon 1 specific, 20 nt length oligomer
sequences, used in the initial screen, were identified using the online CRISPOR
software (crispor.terof.net) and synthesized (Synthego, Redwood City, CA, USA) as
part of a chimeric 100 nt sgRNA. Chemically modified sgRNA oligomers were
manufactured using a proprietary synthesizer by Synthego Corp. (Redwood City,
CA, USA) on controlled-pore glass (AM Chemicals, Carlsbad, CA, USA) using 2′-
O-t-butyldimethylsilyl-protected and 2′-O-methyl ribonucleotide amidites
(ChemGenes, Wilmington, MA) according to established procedures. Standard
ancillary reagents for oxidation, capping and detritylation were used (EMD Mil-
lipore, Cincinatti, OH). Formation of internucleotide phosphorothioate linkages
was performed using ((dimethylaminomethylidene) amino-3H-1,2,4-dithiazoline-
3-thione (DDTT, ChemGenes, Wilmington, MA).
A set of 2′-O-methyl 3′phosphorothioate MS[30] modified full-length 20 nt and
three additional versions having 1, 2, and 3 nt removed from the 5′ end of the
complementary region of the IL2RG sgRNA guide #1 were synthesized (TriLink
Biotechnologies, San Diego, CA, USA) and purified using reverse phase high-
performance liquid chromatography. Purity analysis was confirmed by liquid
chromatography–mass spectrometry.
AAV6-based DNA donor design and vector production. All homology based
AAV6 vector plasmids were cloned into pAAV-MCS plasmid containing AAV2-
specific inverted terminal repeats (ITRs) (Stratagene now part of Agilent Tech-
nologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) using Gibson Assembly cloning kit according to
the instructions in the commercial kit (New England Biolabs, cat # E5510S).

 Corrective, codon diverged IL2RG cDNA was designed to contain silent mutations
that generated 78% sequence homology to the endogenous, wild-type gene. All
AAV6 viruses were produced in 293T in the presence of 1 ng/ml sodium butyrate
(Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no. 303410) cells and purified 48 h later using an iodixanol
gradient approach as previously described5. The following provides additional
detail: all AAV6 viruses were produced in 293T seeded at 14 × 106 cells per dish in
10 15-cm dishes 1 day before transfection. In all, 6 μg ITR-containing plasmid and
22 μg pDGM6 (gift from Dr. David Russell, University of Washington, Seattle, WA,
USA), containing the AAV6 cap genes, AAV2 rep genes, and adenovirus helper
genes were transfected per one 15-cm dish using PEI at a 4:1 ratio (PEI to DNA).
Forty-eight hours post transfection, AAV6 were harvested from cells by three
freeze–thaw cycles, followed by a 45-min incubation with TurboNuclease at 250 U/
mL (Abnova, Heidelberg, Germany). AAV vectors were purified using Iodixanol
density gradient and ultracentrifugation at 48,000 rpms for 2 h at 18 ºC. AAV6
particles were extracted from the 40 to 60% gradient interface and dialyzed, three
times, in PBS (phosphate-buffered saline) containing 5% sorbitol. A 10 K MWCO
slide-a-lyzer G2 dialysis cassette (Thermo Fisher, Santa Clara, CA, USA) was used
for dialyses. Pluronic acid was added to the purified AAV6 at a final concentration
of 0.001%, aliquot and stored at −80 °C.
CD34+ HSPCs. Mobilized peripheral blood (mPB) and bone marow (BM) CD34+
HSPCs cells were purchased from AllCells (Alameda, CA, USA). Cells were thawed
using published protocol55. Freshly purified CB-derived CD34+ HSPCs, of male
origin, were obtained through the Binns Program for Cord Blood Research at
Stanford University, under informed consent. Mononuclear cells (MNCs) isolation
was carried out by density gradient centrifugation using Ficoll Paque Plus (400 × g
for 30 min without brake). Following two platelet washes (200 × g, 10–15 min with
brake) HSPCs were labeled and positively selected using the CD34+ Microbead Kit
Ultrapure (Miltenyi Biotec, San Diego, CA, USA) according to manufacturer’s
protocol. Enriched cells were stained with Allophycocyanin (APC) anti-human
CD34 (clone 561; Biolegend, San Jose, CA, USA) and sample purity was assessed
on an Accuri C6 flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA). Following
purification or thawing, CD34+ HSCPs were cultured for 36–48 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2
and 5% O2, at a density of 2.5 × 105 cells/ml in StemSpan SFEM II (Stemcell
Technologies, Vancouver, Canada) supplemented with Stem Cell Factor (SCF)
(100 ng/ml), Thrombopoietin (TPO) (100 ng/ml), Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand
(Flt3-Ligand) (100 ng/ml), Interleukin 6 (IL-6) (100 ng/ml), StemRegenin 1 (SR1)
(0.75 mM), and UM171 (35 nM, Stemcell Technologies).
For secondary engraftment studies, CD34+ HSPCs were purified from total BM
of NSG mice at end point analysis. Sufficiently pure samples (≥80% CD34+) were
pooled and cultured at 37 °C, 5% CO2, and 5% O2 for 12 h prior to secondary
transplant.
T-cell purification. Primary human T cells were obtained from healthy male
donors from Stanford University School of Medicine Blood Center after informed
consent was obtained and purified by Ficoll density gradient centrifugation fol-
lowed by red blood cell lysis in ammonium chloride solution (Stemcell Technol-
ogies,Vancouver, Canada) and magnetic negative selection using a Pan T-cell
isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec, San Diego, CA, USA) according to manufacturer’s
instructions. Cells were cultured at 37 °C, 20% O2 and 5% CO2 in X-Vivo 15
(Lonza, Walkersville, MD, USA) supplemented with 5% human serum (Sigma-
Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and 100 IU/ml human recombinant IL-2 (Peprotech,
Rocky Hill, NJ, USA) and 10 ng/ml human recombinant IL-7 (BD Biosciences, San
Jose, CA, USA). Cells were stimulated with immobilized anti-CD3 (OKT3, Tonbo
Biosciences, San Diego, CA, USA) and with soluble anti-CD28 (CD28.2, Tonbo
Biosciences) for three days prior to electroporation.
GE and INDEL quantification. Editing of all primary cells was carried out using a
ribonucleic protein (RNP) system at a molar ratio of either 1:2.5 or 1:5 (Cas9:
sgRNA), unless otherwise stated. Recombinant S. pyogenes Cas9 protein was
purchased from IDT (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, Iowa, USA).
Nucleofection was performed in P3 nucleofection solution (Lonza) and Lonza
Nucleofector 4d (program DZ-100). Cells were plated at a concentration of 1.0 ×
105–2.5 × 105 cells/ml. For T cells editing, electroporation was performed using
Lonza Nucleofector 4d (program EO-115) with an RNP composition as used for
CD34+ HSPCs editing. INDEL frequencies were quantified using TIDE online
software on genomic DNA extracted using Quick Extract (Epicentre, an Illumina
Company, cat no. QE09050) according to manufacturing specifications.
Genome targeting and quantification. CD34+ HSPCs nucleofected with the
IL2RG-specific RNP system were plated at a density of 5.0 × 105 cells/ml and
transduced with the AAV6 donor at an multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 200,000
vg/μl within 15 min of nucleofection. Cells were cultured at 37 °C, 5% CO2, 5% O2
for 36 h to 48 h after which they were either re-plated in fresh media, at a density of
2.5 × 105 cells/ml or prepared for xenotransplantation studies.
Absolute quantification of the levels of genomic integration was carried out
using Digital Droplet PCRTM (ddPCRTM, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Genomic
DNA was extracted as described in previous section. In all, 1 μg of genomic DNA
was digested with EcoRV-HF (20U) in Cutsmart buffer at 37 °C for 1 h. ddPCR
reaction contains 1× reference primer/probe mix synthesized at a 3.6 ratio (900 nM
primer and 250 nM FAM labeled probe), 1× target primer/probe mix synthesized
at a 3.6 ratio (HEX labeled probe), 1× ddPCR Supermix for probe without dUTP,
50 ng of digested DNA and water for a total volume of 25 μl. The primers and
probes sequences are detailed in Table S2.
Genomic DNA in the ddPCR mixture was partitioned into individual droplets
using QX100 Droplet Generator, transferred to a 96-deep well PCR plate and
amplified in a Bio-Rad PCR thermocycler. The following ddPCR program was
optimized to amplify a 500-bp amplicon: step 1—95 °C for 10 min, ramp 1 °C/s,
step 2—94 °C for 30 s, ramp 1 °C/s, step 3—60.8 °C for 30 s, ramp 1 °C/s, step 4—
72 °C for 2 min, ramp 1 °C/s, step 5—repeat steps 2–4 for 50 cycles, step 6—98 °C
for 10 min, ramp 1 °C/s, step 7—4 °C, ramp 1 °C/s. Bio-Rad Droplet Reader and
QuantaSoft Software were used to read and analyzed the experiment following
manufacturer’s guidelines (Bio-Rad). Absolute quantification as copy of DNA/μl
was determined for the reference, endogenous IL2RG gene and for the integrated
IL2RG cDNA. Percent targeting in total population was calculated as a ratio of
HEX to FAM signal. For all targeting experiments, genomic DNA was derived from
male donors.
Quantification of IL2RG cDNA targeted integration frequencies in SCID-Xl
patients was assessed based on agarose gel quantification as IL2RG cDNA signal
ratio intensity.
Methylcellulose CFU assay. Two days post genome targeting, single cells were
sorted onto 96-well plates coated with MethoCult Optimum (StemCell Technol-
ogies, cat no H4034). Fourteen days later, colonies derived from targeted and
mock-treated cells were counted and scored based on morphological features
pertaining to Colony Forming Units-erytroid (CFU-E), erythroid burst forming
units (BFU-E), Colony Forminig Unit- Granulocytes, Monocytes (CFU-GM), and
CFU-GEMM. Genotyping analysis was performed to quantify the percent of
mono-allelic targeting. A three primer-based IL2RG-specific genotyping PCR-
based protocol was established an optimized as follows: IL2RG WT-F1 5′-
GGGTGACCAAGTCAAGGAAG-3′; int-IL2RG-R1: 5′-GATGGTGGTATT-
CAAGCCGACCCCGA-3′; IL2RG WT-R2: 5′-AATGTCCCACAGTATCCCTGG-
3′. The PCR reaction contained 0.5 μM of each of the three primer, 1× Phusion
Master Mix High Fidelity, 150−200 ng of genomic DNA and water to a final
volume of 25 μl. The following PCR program generated an integration band of 543
bp from F1 and R1 primer set and an endogenous band of 1502 bp from F1 and R2
primer set: step 1—98 °C for 30 s, step 2—98 °C for 10 s; step 3—66 °C for 30 s; step
4—72 °C for 30 s, step 5—repeat steps 2–4 for a total of 30 cycles, step 6—72 °C for
7 min; step 7—4 °C.
OP9-idll1 system. OP9 cells were generously provided by Dr. Irving Weissman’s
lab and generated as previously described40. Briefly, OP9 stromal cells were
infected with two lentiviral constructs, the first containing a TET-ON tetracycline
trans-activator (rtTA3) under control of a constitutive promoter (EF1a) and linked
to turboRFP, and the second containing the Dll1 gene under control of a tet-
responsive element (TRE) promoter and linked to turboRFP. In the presence of
tetracycline or doxycyline, the rtTA3 rapidly activates expression of Dll1 and
turboRFP.
Lymphoid differentiation of patient-derived CD34+ HSPCs. SCID-X1 patient-
derived CD34+ HSPCs were targeted with the IL2RG cDNA corrective donor.
Forty-eight hours post targeting, 300 cells derived from either un-target or IL2RG
cDNA targeted were sorted onto a well of a 96-well plate seeded with 50,000 OP9-
idll1 cells 48 h in advance. Cells were incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2, 10% O2 for
1 week in activation media containing: alpha-MEM base media (ThermoFisher, cat
no. 32561102), supplied with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; GemCell, cat no. 100-
500), mono-thioglycerol (MTG) (100 μM), ascorbic acid (50 μg/ml), 1× penicillin/
streptomycin, SCF (10 ng/ml, PeproTech, cat no. AF-300-07), Flt-3L (5 ng/ml,
PeproTech, cat no. AF-300-19), IL-7 (5 ng/ml PeproTech, cat no. 200-07), IL-3
(3.3 ng/ml, PeproTech cat no. AF-200-03), Granulocyte-macrophage colony-sti-
mulating factor (10 ng/ml, PeproTech, cat no. AF-300-03), TPO (10 ng/ml,
PeproTech cat no. AF-300-18), EPO (2 U/ml, PeproTech, cat no. 100-64), IL-15
(10 ng/ml, PeproTech cat no. AF-200-15), IL-6 (10 ng/ml, PeproTech, cat no. 200-
06). After 7 days, half the medium was exchanged and DOX was added at a final
concentration of 1 μg/ml.
In vitro multi-lineage differentiation analysis. Lymphoid, myeloid, and ery-
throid differentiation potential was determined using FACS analysis at 1 week post
DOX induction. In all, 100% growth was obtained from all wells seeded with 300
targeted or mock-treated cells. Media were removed from all positive wells and cells
were washed in 1× PBS. Cells were re-suspended in 50 μl MACS buffer (1× PBS,
2% FBS, 2 mM EDTA), blocked for nonspecific binding (5% vol/vol human FcR
blocking reagent, Miltenyi, cat no. 130-059-901), stained for live dead dis-
crimination using Live/Dead blue dead cell staining kit for UV (ThermoFisher
Scientific, cat no. L23105) and stained (30 min, 4 °C dark) using CD3 PerCP/Cy5.5
(HiT3A, BioLegend), CD4 BV650 (OKT4, BioLegend), CD8 APC (HiT8a, BioLe-
gend), CD11c BV605 (3.9, BioLegend), CD14 BV510 (M5E2, BioLegend), CD19
FITC (HIB19, BioLegend), CD33 AF-300 (WM53, BD Pharmingen), CD45 BV786

BioLegend), and CD271 (tNGFR) CF-594 (C40-1457, BD Horizon).
Phosphorylated STAT5 in vitro assay. To assess STAT5 phosphorylation in
response to cytokine stimulation, purified human T cells were cultured for 7 days
post electroporation and starved, overnight, in medium lacking serum and cyto-
kines. Samples were split and either stimulated with IL-2 (100 U/ml) and IL-7 (10
ng/ml) or left unstimulated. Cells were split again, fixed, permeabilized using 4%
PFA and methanol and stained with CD3 PE (UCHT1, BioLegend), CD271
(tNGFR) APC (ME20.4, Biolegend). Intracellular antigens were stained with
pSTAT5 AF-488 (pY694, BD Bioscience) or isotype control (BD Biosciences).
FACS analysis was performed on Accuri C6 (BD Biosciences) or Cytoflex (Beck-
man Coulter) and data analysis was performed using FlowJo.
CFSE cellular proliferation of IL2RG targeted human T cells. Purified human
T cells were nucleofected alone (mock treated) or in the presence of the long
corrective IL2RG cDNA-tNGFR DNA donor vector. NGFRbright T cells were
sorted. NGFRbright or mock-treated cells were labeled with CFSE (BioLegend)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol and either re-stimulated with anti-CD3/
anti-CD28/IL-2/IL-7 as described in previous section or left unstimulated (IL-7
only). Targeting levels were monitored and quantified based on the tNGFR
expression and on absolute quantification of the integrated IL2RG cDNA by
ddPCR.
Xenotransplantation of genome targeted CD34+ HSPCs into mice. For all
human engraftment studies, we used freshly purified CB derived CD34+ HSPCs
derived from healthy male donors, under informed consent. Human engraftment
studies designed to rescue the disease phenotype were carried out using frozen,
mPB CD34+ HSPCs derived from SCID-Xl patients 1–3. SCID-X1 patients were
given subcutaneous injections of Granulocytes Colony-Stimulating Factor (G-CSF)
(filgrastim, Neupogen®; Amgen, Thousand Oaks, CA) for 5 consecutive days at
10–16 mcg/kg/day and one dose of Pleraxifor for mobilization and apheresis
(National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Disease IRB-approved protocol 94-I-
0073). PB CD34+ HSPCs were selected from the leukepheresis product using
Miltenyi CliniMACS.
Human engraftment experimental design and mouse handling followed an
approved Stanford University Administrative Panel on Lab Animal Care (APLAC).
Cells used for engraftment studies were exposed to a maximum of 4 days ex vivo
culturing.
IH primary (1°) human engraftment. In all, 1.0 × 105 to 2.5 × 105 cells derived
from IL2RG cDNA targeted cells or mock-treated cells (electroporated in the
absence of RNP and never exposed to AAV6) were re-suspended in 25−30 μl of
freshly prepared CD34+ complete media with the addition of UM171 and SR1.
Three to 4 days old NSG pups were irradiated with 100 cGy and immediately
engrafted IH using an insulin syringe with a 27 gauge × ½” needle. A total of
2.15 × 106 cells from each condition were injected into 11 pups/condition. In all,
18/22 engrafted pups were analyzed at week 16 post engraftment.
Level of human engraftment was assessed at weeks 8 and 12 using BM aspirates
and PB samples. At week 16 or later, end point analysis was done from total BM,
SP, liver, and PB. For total BM analysis, mouse bones were harvested from tibiae,
femurs, sternum, and spinal cord from each mouse and grinded using a mortar and
pestle. MNCs were purified using Ficoll gradient centrifugation (Ficoll-Paque Plus,
GE Healthcare, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) for 25 min at 2000 × g, at room temperature.
SP and liver samples were grinded against a 40 μM mesh, transferred to a FACS
tube and spun down at 300 × g for 5 min, at 4 °C. Red blood cells were lysed
following a 10- to 12-min incubation on ice with 500 μl of 1× ACK lysis buffer
(ThermoScientific, cat no. A1049201). Reaction was quenched and cells were
washed with MACS buffer (2–5% FBS, 2 mM EDTA, and 1× PBS). PB samples
were treated with 500 μl of 2% Dextren and incubated at 37 C for 30 min to 1 h. In
all, 800 μl to 1 ml of the top layer was transferred to a FACS tube, spun down at
300 × g, 5 min and red blood cells lysed as already described.
Cells purified from all four sources were re-suspended in 50 μl MACS buffer,
blocked, stained with LIVE/Dead staining solution and stained for 30 min at 4 °C,
dark with the following antibody panel: CD3 PerCP/Cy5.5 (HiT3A, BioLegend),
CD19 FITC (HIB19, BioLegend), mCD45.1 PE-Cy7 (A20, BioLegend), CD16 PE-
Cy5 (3G8, BD Pharmingen), CD235a PE (HI264, BioLegend), HLA A-B-C APC-
Cy7 (W6/32, BioLegend), CD33 AF-300 (WM53, BD Pharmingen), CD8 APC
(HiT8a, BioLegend), CD45 BV786 (HI3a, BD Horizon), CD4 BV650 (OKT4,
BioLegend), CD11c BV605 (BioLegend), CD14 BV510 (M5E2, BioLegend), and
CD56 Pacific Blue (MEM-188, BioLegend).
IF primary (1°) human engraftment. In all, 5.0 × 105 cells derived from WT cells,
mock treated, RNP treated, and IL2RG cDNA targeted cells were injected IF into
6–8 weeks old NSG mice. Mice were irradiated with 200 cGy 2–4 h prior to
engraftment. Cells were prepared in the same fashion as described in the IH
section. A total of 2.0 × 106 WT cells were injected into a total of four mice, 3.5 ×
106 mock-treated cells were injected into seven mice, 2.0 × 106 RNP-treated cells
were injected into four mice and 7.5 × 106 IL2RG cDNA targeted cells were injected
into 15 mice. In all, 29/30 injected mice were analyzed at week 16 post engraftment,
as described in the IH engraftment assay section.
Secondary (2°) human engraftment. Secondary engraftments experiments were
derived from both IH and from IF engrafted human cells. From the IH mock and
IL2RG cDNA targeted engrafted mice, total BM was collected at week 16 post
primary engraftment, MNC were purified using Ficoll gradient centrifugation and
CD34+ cells were enriched using CD34+ microbeads (Miltenyi). Enriched cells
were pooled from five engrafted mice with mock-treated cells and from seven
engrafted mice with IL2RG cDNA targeted cells and cultured overnight in com-
plete CD34+ media containing UM171 and SR1. Following overnight incubation,
cellular count and viability was determined for mock-treated cells to be 2.47 × 106
cells at 85.5% viability and for IL2RG cDNA targeted cells was 4.8 × 106 cells at 84%
viability. In all, 3.5 × 105 mock-treated cells and 5.0 × 105 IL2RG cDNA targeted
cells were engrafted IF into eight 6–8 weeks old, irradiated NSG mice (four males
and four females).
Secondary engraftment experiments derived from IF primary engraftments
were carried on as described above with the following modification: 5.0 × 105
CD34+ enriched cells derived from WT, mock and RNP primary engraftment
assay were IF injected into four 6–8 weeks old NSG mice, 5.0 × 105 CD34+
enriched cells derived from IL2RG cDNA targeted cells were IF injected into 12
6–8 weeks old NSG mice. Equal numbers of male and female mice were used.
IH primary (1°) human engraftment. Frozen mPB CD34+ HSPCs derived from
SCID-Xl patients were thawed and genome targeted as described in previous
section. In all, 2.5 × 105 cells were IH injected into 3–4 days old, irradiated NSG
pups.
GUIDE-Seq. sgRNAs were generated by cloning annealed oligos containing the
IL2RG target sequence into pX330 (Gift from Feng Zhang, Addgene #42230)56. In
all, 200,000 U2OS cells (ATCC #HTB-96) were nucleofected with 1 μg of pX330
Cas9 and gRNA plasmid and 100 pmol dsODN using SE cell line nucleofection
solution and the CA-138 program on a Lonza 4D-nucleofector. The nucleofected
cells were seeded in 500 μl of McCoy’s 5a Medium Modified (ATCC) in a 24-well
plate. Genomic DNA (gDNA) was extracted 3 days post nucleofection using a
Quick-DNA Miniprep plus kit (Zymo Research). Successful integration of the
dsODN was confirmed by RFLP assay with NdeI. In all, 400 ng of gDNA was
sheared using a Covaris LE220 Ultrasonicator to an average length of 500 bp.
Samples were prepared for Guide-seq41 and sequenced on the Illumina Miseq.
Briefly, solid-phase reversible immobilization magnetic beads were used to isolate
genomic DNA, which was further sheared to an averaged of 500 bp (Covaris S200),
end-repaired and ligated to adaptors containing 8-nt random molecular index.
Target enrichment was achieved through two rounds of nested PCR using primers
complementary to the oligo tag. We analyzed GUIDE-Seq data using the standard
pipeline41 with a reduced gap penalty for better detection of off-target sites con-
taining DNA or RNA bulges.
Bioinformatic off-target identification. Potential off-target sites for the IL2RG
gRNA in the human genome (hg19) were identified using the web tool COSMID42
with up to three mismatches allowed in the 19 PAM (protospacer adjacent motif)
proximal bases. After off-target site ranking, 45 sites were selected for off-target
screening.
Off-target validation. Frozen mPB CD34+ cells (AllCells) were electroporated
with 300 μg/ml of Cas9 and 160 μg/ml of sgRNA. sgDNA was extracted 48 h after
RNP delivery. Off-target sites were amplified by locus-specific PCR. PCR primers
contained adapter sequences to facilitate amplicon barcoding via a second round of
PCR as previously described57. All amplicons were pooled at an equimolar ratio
and sequenced on the Illumina Miseq according to manufacturer’s instructions
using custom sequencing primers for Read 2 and Read Index. Sequencing data were
analyzed using a custom INDEL quantification pipeline58.
Karyotype analysis. Fresh CB CD34+ HSPCs were purified, genome edited or
targeted as previously described. Four days post ex vivo culturing and manipula-
tions, 5 × 105 cells from WT untreated, mock, RNP only, RNP and AAV6 or AAV6
only treated cells were processed by Stanford Cytology Labs at Stanford University.
Karyotyping analysis was performed on 20 cells derived from each condition.
IL2RG-specific genotoxicity assays in human cell lines. Levels of γH2AX
induced by different classes of engineered nucleases were quantified by measuring
the phosphorylation of histone H2AX, a marker of DSB formation. K562 cells were
nucleofected with the indicated doses of each nuclease expression plasmid, and the
percentage of γH2AX+ cells was measured by FACS at 48 h post nucleofection.
293T cells were co-transfected with plasmids expressing GFP and nuclease.
GFP-positive cells were analyzed at day 2 and again at day 6 by FACS. Percent
