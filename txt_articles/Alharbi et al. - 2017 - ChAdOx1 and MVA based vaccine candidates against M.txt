The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has infected more than 1900 humans,
since 2012. The syndrome ranges from asymptomatic and mild cases to severe pneumonia and death.
The virus is believed to be circulating in dromedary camels without notable symptoms since the
1980s. Therefore, dromedary camels are considered the only animal source of infection. Neither antiviral
drugs nor vaccines are approved for veterinary or medical use despite active research on this area. Here,
we developed four vaccine candidates against MERS-CoV based on ChAdOx1 and MVA viral vectors, two
candidates per vector. All vaccines contained the full-length spike gene of MERS-CoV; ChAdOx1 MERS
vaccines were produced with or without the leader sequence of the human tissue plasminogen activator
gene (tPA) where MVA MERS vaccines were produced with tPA, but either the mH5 or F11 promoter driv-
ing expression of the spike gene. All vaccine candidates were evaluated in a mouse model in prime only
or prime-boost regimens. ChAdOx1 MERS with tPA induced higher neutralising antibodies than ChAdOx1
MERS without tPA. A single dose of ChAdOx1 MERS with tPA elicited cellular immune responses as well
as neutralising antibodies that were boosted to a significantly higher level by MVA MERS. The humoral
immunogenicity of a single dose of ChAdOx1 MERS with tPA was equivalent to two doses of MVA
MERS (also with tPA). MVA MERS with mH5 or F11 promoter induced similar antibody levels; however,
F11 promoter enhanced the cellular immunogenicity of MVA MERS to significantly higher magnitudes. In
conclusion, our study showed that MERS-CoV vaccine candidates could be optimized by utilising differ-
ent viral vectors, various genetic designs of the vectors, or different regimens to increase immunogenic-
ity. ChAdOx1 and MVA vectored vaccines have been safely evaluated in camels and humans and these
MERS vaccine candidates should now be tested in camels and in clinical trials.

1. Introduction
Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is caused by a novel
betacoronavirus (MERS-CoV) that was isolated in late 2012 in
Saudi Arabia [1]. The syndrome (MERS) is described as a viral infec-
tion that causes fever, cough, and/or shortness of breath and to a
lesser extent gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea [2]. Sev-
ere disease from MERS-CoV infection can cause respiratory failure
and organ failure, and cases can be fatal, especially in patients with
co-morbidities such as diabetes and cardiac complications. How-
ever, the infection can be asymptomatic or mild in many cases
[3–7]. MERS-CoV has spread to 27 countries and infected more
than 1900 humans with a mortality rate of 40% [2]. Dromedary
camels, especially juveniles, contract the infection and shed the
virus, without notable symptoms of disease; this is now known
to have been occurring since the early 1980s [8–13]. The mecha-
nism of camel to human transmission is still not clear, but several
primary cases have been associated with camel contact, which is
considered an important risk factor [14–16]. Therefore, camels

 are being considered an intermediate host and one of the sources
of MERS-CoV infection [8–13]. Other livestock animals such as
sheep, goats, cows, chicken, and horses have proved seronegative
in many studies [17–20]. Further, these animals did not produc-
tively contract MERS-CoV when they were inoculated experimen-
tally [21,22]. Therefore, to date, dromedary camels are the only
confirmed animal reservoir. There is currently no approved vaccine
against MERS-CoV for camels or humans despite active vaccine
research and development. A number of vaccine candidates have
been developed using various platforms and regimens and have
been tested in several animal models [23]. Viral vectors are potent
platform technologies that have been utilised to develop vaccines
against malaria, tuberculosis, influenza, HIV, HCV, Ebola, and many
viral pathogens. These vectors include adenoviruses, poxviruses,
yellow fever viruses, and alphaviruses [24,25], and they are pre-
ferred for their ability to induce cellular immune responses in
addition to humoral immunity. Here, we report development of
MERS-CoV vaccine candidates that are based on two different viral
vectors: Chimpanzee Adenovirus, Oxford University #1 (ChAdOx1)
[26] and Modified Vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) [27,28]. Each viral
vector was developed by generating two alternative versions,
resulting in four vaccine candidates that all encode the same com-
plete MERS-CoV spike gene (S). The two ChAdOx1 based vaccines
were produced with or without the signal peptide of the human
tissue plasminogen activator gene (tPA) at the N terminus. Previ-
ous studies have shown that encoding tPA upstream of recombi-
nant
antigens
enhanced
immunogencity,
although
results
differed depending on the antigens employed. The tPA encoded
upstream of influenza A virus nucleoprotein, in a DNA vector,
enhanced both cellular and humoral immune responses in mice
[29,30], whereas the same leader sequence resulted in increased
humoral sequences but decreased cellular responses to HIV Gag
[30]. The two MVA based vaccines were produced with either the
mH5 or F11 poxviral promoter driving antigen expression, both
including the tPA sequence at the N terminus of MERS-CoV Spike
protein. Previously, we reported the ability of the strong early
F11 promoter to enhance cellular immunogenicity of vaccine anti-
gen candidates for malaria and influenza, as compared to utilising
p7.5 or mH5 early/late promoters which resulted in a lower level of
gene expression immediately after virus infection of target cells,
but higher levels at a later stage [31]. Here, we continue to assess
the F11 promoter in enhancing cellular immunogenicity, and to
investigate its ability to impact on humoral immune responses.
The four vaccine candidates were evaluated in a number of
different regimens in mouse models that showed a single dose of
ChAdOx1 MERS inducing higher cellular and humoral immuno-
genicity than a single dose of MVA MERS, or equivalent to two
doses of MVA MERS. ChAdOx1 based vaccines have been tested
in different animal models, including camels [32], and in human
clinical trials and proved safe and immunogenic [33]. Therefore,
based on our data, ChAdOx1 MERS can be readily developed for
use as a MERS vaccine in humans. Furthermore, utilising ChAdOx1
MERS for camel vaccination can serve the one-health approach
whereby blocking MERS-CoV transmission in camels is expected
to prevent human infections.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Transgene and shuttle vector cloning
The spike (S) gene of MERS-CoV camel isolate (Genbank acces-
sion number: KJ650098.1) was synthesised by GeneArt Gene Syn-
thesis (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The S transgene was then cloned
into four shuttle plasmid vectors following In-Fusion cloning
(Clontech). Two plasmids contained the S transgene within the
E1 homologous region of ChAdOx1, driven by the human cytome-
galovirus major immediate early promoter (IE CMV) that includes
intron A. One of the ChAdOx1 shuttle plasmids was designed to
include the tPA signal sequence upstream of the transgene
sequence while the second plasmid did not contain the tPA. The
ChAdOx1 shuttle plasmids contained the S transgene within Gate-
way� recombination cassettes. To construct MVA MERS, one of the
shuttle plasmids for MVA was designed to have the upstream and
downstream (flanks) of the F11L ORF as homologous sequence
arms. Inserting the S transgene within these arms enabled the util-
isation of the endogenous F11 promoter, which is part of the right
homologous arm, while deleting the native F11L ORF. This resulted
in the shuttle vector for generation of F11-MVA MERS (F11 shuttle
vector). The mH5 promoter sequence was subcloned upstream of
the S transgene; and this mH5-S transgene was then subcloned
into the F11 shuttle vector. This resulted in the shuttle vector for
generation of mH5-MVA MERS (F11/mH5 shuttle vector). mH5-
MVA MERS contained the mH5 promoter at the F11L locus, how-
ever, the endogenous F11 promoter is intact and located upstream
of the mH5 promoter. The endogenous F11 promoter could not be
replaced with the mH5 since it is part of the essential upstream
ORF.
2.2. Immunostaining for transgene expression
The ChAdOx1 shuttle plasmid, described above, was used to val-
idate the expression of MERS-CoV spike protein in vitro. An African
green monkey kidney cell line (Vero cells) was seeded into 6-well
plate to 80% confluence. Then the plasmid DNA was transfected
into Vero cells using Lipofectamine� 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scien-
tific) following manufacturer’s instruction. Twenty-four hours after
transfection, cells were fixed, permeabilised, and immunostained
using a rabbit polyclonal anti-MERS-CoV spike antibody, following
standard protocols. DAPI stain was used to label nuclei.
2.3. Construction of recombinant ChAdOx1 and MVA encoding MERS-
CoV S antigens
The ChAdOx1 MERS vaccines were prepared by Gateway�
recombination between the ChAdOx1 destination DNA BAC vector
(described in [26]) and entry plasmids containing the coding
sequence for MERS-CoV spike gene (ChAdOx1 shuttle vectors
explained above), according to standard protocols. ChAdOx1 MERS
genomes were then derived in HEK293A cell lines (Invitrogen, Cat.
R705-07), the resultant viruses were purified by CsCl gradient
ultracentrifugation as previously described [34]. The titres were
determined on HEK293A cells using anti-hexon immunostaining
assay based on the QuickTiterTM Adenovirus Titer Immunoassay
kit (Cell Biolabs Inc). For MVA MERS vaccines chicken embryo
fibroblast cells (CEFs) were infected with MVA parental virus that
encodes dsRed marker instead of the native F11L ORF and trans-
fected with MVA shuttle plasmids containing MERS-CoV spike
gene (explained above) to allow recombination with the MVA gen-
ome and deletion of dsRed marker whilst keeping the F11 pro-
moter sequence.
Recombinant MVA expressing MERS-CoV S
protein was purified by plaque-picking and fluorescent selection
using the sorting function of CyCLONE robotic module of a MoFlo
Flow
cytometer
(Dako
Cytomation,
Denmark)
as
previously
described [31]. F11-MVA MERS and mH5-MVA MERS were con-
firmed to lack the native F11L ORF (and the dsRed marker), and
contain MERS-CoV S by PCR (identity and purity PCR screening).
The sequence of the S transgene amplified from these vaccines
was confirmed. The recombinant viruses (vaccines) were amplified
in 1500 cm2 monolayers of CEFs cells, partially purified over
sucrose cushions and titrated in CEFs cells according to standard
practice, and purity and identity were again verified by PCR.

 2.4. Mouse immunogenicity
Female BALB/c mice (Harlan, UK) aged 6–8 weeks were immu-
nised intramuscularly (i.m.) in the upper leg (total volume 50 mL)
with a total of 108 IU of ChAdOx1 MERS with or without tPA or
with a total of 106 pfu of either F11-MVA MERS or mH5-MVA
MERS. For induction of short-term anaesthesia, animals were
anaesthetised using vaporised IsoFloH. In prime only regimens,
mice were vaccinated with ChAdOx1 with blood samples taken
at 14 days post immunisation (d.p.i) or 28 d.p.i. for serum isola-
tion; and spleens were collected at 28 d.p.i. In heterologous
prime-boost regimens, mice were vaccinated with ChAdOx1 MERS
and boosted with MVA MERS at 28 d.p.i; mice were bled at 28 d.p.i.
(post-prime) or 42 d.p.i (14 days post-boost) for serum isolation,
and spleens were collected at 42 d.p.i. In homologous regimens,
mice were vaccinated with MVA MERS and boosted with MVA
MERS at 21 d.p.i; mice were bled on 21 d.p.i. (post-prime) or 42
d.p.i (post-boost) for serum isolation and spleens were collected
at 42 d.p.i.
2.5. ELISpot, ICS, and flow cytometry
Splenocytes were harvested for analysis by IFN-c ELISpot or
intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) and flow cytometry as previ-
ously described [35,36], using re-stimulation with 2 mg/mL S291
MERS-CoV S-specific peptide (VYDTIKYYSIIPHSI); for vaccine cellu-
lar immunogenicity [37]); or 1 mg/mL E3 and F2(G) MVA vector-
specific peptides [38] (for anti-MVA immune responses). In the
absence of peptide re-stimulation, the frequency of IFN-c+ cells,
which was typically 0.1% by flow cytometry or less than 50 SFC
by ELISpot, was subtracted from tested re-stimulated samples.
2.6. ELISA
2 lg/mL with capturing antigen (S1 recombinant protein from
MyBioSource, CA, USA) were used to coat ELISA plates, and stan-
dard
endpoint
ELISA
protocol
was
followed,
as
previously
described [39]. Sera were prepared in a 10-fold serial dilution in
PBS/T and then 50 lL were plated in duplicate wells. Serum from
a naïve BALB/c mouse was included as a negative control. Goat
anti-mouse total IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Sigma)
and PNPP tablet (20 mg p-nitrophenylphosphate, SIGMA) substrate
were used in the assay.
2.7. Merspp neutralisation assay
MERS pseudotyped viral particles (MERSpp) were produced and
titrated using Huh7.5 cell line as described previously [40]. For the
MERSpp neutralisation assay, serum samples were serially diluted
in 96-well white plates (Nunc). A standard concentration of the
MERSpp were added to the wells and plates were incubated for
1 h at 37 �C. After incubation, Huh7.5 cells (10,000 cells per well)
were added to the plate in duplicates. Following 48 h incubation,
cells were lysed and luciferase activity was measured. IC90 neu-
tralisation titres were calculated for each mouse serum sample
using GraphPad Prism.
2.8. Virus neutralisation assay
Induction
of
virus-neutralising
antibodies
was
confirmed
according to previously published protocols [37,41]. Briefly, mouse
serum samples were tested for their capacity to neutralise MERS-
CoV (EMC isolate) infections in vitro with 100 50% tissue culture
infective doses (TCID50) in Huh-7 cells. Sera of non-immunised
mice served as negative control.
2.9. Statistical analysis
GraphPad Prism (GraphPad software) was used for statistical
analysis and to plot data.
2.10. Ethics statement
All animal procedures were performed in accordance with the
terms of the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act (ASPA) for
the project licenses 30/2414 or 30/2889 and were approved by
the University of Oxford Animal Care and Ethical Review Commit-
tee. All mice were housed for at least 7 days for settlement prior to
any procedure in the University animal facility, Oxford, UK under
Specific Pathogen Free (SPF) conditions.
3. Results
3.1. Construction and antigen expression of MERS-CoV vaccine
candidates
The spike gene from a camel isolate (Camel/Qatar_2_2014
MERS-CoV isolate, GenBank accession number KJ650098.1) was
cloned into four shuttle vectors that facilitate homologous recom-
bination with the genome of ChAdOx1 or MVA. Four recombinant
viral vectors, two ChAdOx1 and two MVA, were derived as
described in the materials and methods. ChAdOx1 based vaccine
candidates were generated with or without the signal peptide of
the human tissue plasminogen activator gene (tPA). The spike
transgene expression in ChAdOx1 MERS vaccine candidates is
under the control of the human cytomegalovirus major immediate
early promoter (CMV IE) that includes intron A. In MVA MERS vac-
cine candidates, the tPA was also inserted upstream of the spike
transgene, which was under the control of either the ectopic
mH5 promoter or the endogenous F11 promoter (Fig. 1A). All of
our MERS-CoV vaccine candidates contain the same codon-
optimized spike transgene. The expression of the newly synthe-
sized transgene was first tested by transfection of an African green
monkey kidney cell line (Vero cells) with the adenovirus shuttle
vector, and immunofluorescence staining of the transfected cells
(Fig. 1B and 1C). This was performed to confirm the expression
of the codon optimized spike transgene in mammalian cells. The
level of transgene expression from the four vaccine candidates
was not evaluated in vitro. We have previously reported that differ-
ences in MVA promoter activity detectable in vitro does not corre-
late with in vivo immunogenicity [31], and that only in vivo
expression correlates with the in vivo immunogenicity.
3.2. Humoral immunogenicity of ChAdOx1 based MERS-CoV vaccine
candidates
To evaluate humoral immune responses to ChAdOx1 MERS with
or without tPA, BALB/c mice were vaccinated with 1 � 108 IU of
ChAdOx1 intramuscularly. Serum samples from 14 and 28 d.p.i.
were collected and evaluated by ELISA. Both vaccine candidates
induced a high level of S1-specific antibodies (mean endpoint titre
(Log10) = 4.8 with tPA, 4.7 without tPA), unlike the control vaccine,
ChAdOx1 encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (ChAdOx1-
eGFP, mean endpoint titre (Log10) = 1). These antibody levels were
similar between the two candidates (with or without tPA) at day
14. However, at 28 d.p.i. ChAdOx1 MERS with tPA induced signifi-
cantly higher S1-specific antibodies than ChAdOx1 MERS without
tPA (mean endpoint titre (Log10) = 5.13 with tPA, 4.6 without tPA,
Fig. 2A). Serum samples from day 28 were selected for MERSpp
neutralisation assay. Serum antibodies induced by ChAdOx1 MERS
with tPA showed significantly higher neutralisation activity than
3782
N.K. Alharbi et al. / Vaccine 35 (2017) 3780–3788
 without tPA (mean titre IC90 (Log10) = 2.8 with tPA, 2.2 without
tPA; Fig. 2B). In order to confirm that the psuedotyped virus neu-
tralisation assay was producing biologically relevant results, serum
samples from mice immunised with ChAdOx1 MERS with tPA were
also tested in a neutralisation assay utilising wildtype MERS virus.
This assay confirmed the neutralisation activity of mouse antibod-
ies (nAb) with a median of 360 VNT (Virus Neutralization Test anti-
body titre; Fig. 2C). We therefore continued to evaluate ChAdOx1
MERS with tPA in addition to generating MVA MERS vaccine candi-
dates with tPA.
3.3. Cellular immunogenicity of ChAdOx1 based MERS-CoV vaccine
candidates
Having established the utility of tPA in ChAdOx1 MERS vaccines
(referred to as ChAdOx1 MERS in the rest of this report) at increasing
humoral responses, spleens were collected at 28 d.p.i. from immu-
nised BALB/c mice. Splenocytes were processed to evaluate cellular
immune responses to ChAdOx1 MERS in ELISpot and Intracellular
cytokine staining (ICS). Peptide S291, described by others [37],
was used to re-stimulate the cells in both assays and ELISpot data
showed a high level of IFN-c secreting splenocytes (Median = 1300
SFU/106 splenocytes; Fig. 3A). ICS data confirmed the IFN-c secret-
ing CD8+ splenocytes also secreted TNF-a and IL-17 (Fig. 3B).
3.4. Immunogenicity of heterologous ChAdOx1 and MVA vaccination
against MERS-CoV
To evaluate humoral immune responses to heterologous prime-
boost vaccination, BALB/c mice were immunised with ChAdOx1
MERS vaccine and boosted with one of two different MVA MERS
vaccine candidates four weeks later. The MVA based candidates
differ in the promoters that controls the transgene expression:
F11-MVA MERS utilises the endogenous strong early F11 promoter
and mH5-MVA MERS utilises the ectopic early/late mH5 promoter.
Serum samples from 28 d.p.i. (post-prime) or 42 d.p.i. (post-boost)
were collected and evaluated by ELISA and MERSpp neutralisation
assay.
At

d.p.i.

induced

antibodies
and

as
observed
previously
(Fig. 4A and B). At 42 d.p.i. S1-specific antibodies were boosted
to a higher level (mean endpoint titre (Log10) = 5 by ChAdOx1
MERS boosted to 5.8 by mH5-MVA MERS or 5.9 by F11-MVA
MERS); Fig. 4A) with nAb also enhanced to a statistically significant
level (mean titre IC90 (Log10) = 2.87 by ChAdOx1 MERS boosted to
3.3 by mH5-MVA MERS or 3.5 by F11-MVA MERS; Fig. 4B). There
was no difference in antibody levels induced using either the F11
or mH5 promoter in the MVA.
At 42 d.p.i. splenocytes were also processed to evaluate cellular
immune responses to ChAdOx1 MERS MVA MERS prime-boost vac-
cination in ELISpot and ICS as shown in Fig. 3. The T cell responses to
MERS S were boosted by the MVA vaccinations; in the ICS experi-
ments, F11-MVA and mH5-MVA boosted the percentage of IFN-c+
splenic CD8+ T cells to 7.3 and 5.2% respectively (Fig. 4D) whereas
the percentage was 2.5% after ChAdOx1 MERS prime in Fig. 3B. The
percentage of TNF-a+ splenic CD8+ T cells were also increased by
MVA boost (comparing Fig. 3B and 4D). Utilising the F11 promoter
resulted in a trend towards greater cell-mediated immunogenicity
(Fig. 4C and D). Splenocytes were also re-stimulated with MVA
backbone-specific E3 and F(G)2 peptides and evaluated in ICS. Both
MVA based vaccines induced similar responses to E3 or to F(G)2 pep-

 tides, 2 weeks after MVA vaccination (Fig. 4E and F). This similarity
confirmed the efficiency of vaccine titration, vaccination, and sam-
ple processing because responses to each of those peptides are not
expected to be different unless there is variation in the doses admin-
istered or sample preparation. Overall, MVA MERS vaccines were
able to boost the humoral and cellular immune responses to ChA-
dOx1 MERS prime vaccination. There was no difference between
the F11 and mH5 promoter in the resulting antibodytitres after ChA-
dOx1 prime/MVA boost, but there was a trend towards increased
cellular immunogenicity when the F11 promoter was used.
3.5. Immunogenicity of homologous MVA vaccination against MERS-
CoV
To evaluate humoral immune responses to a homologous MVA
MERS prime-boost vaccination, two groups of BALB/c mice were
immunised with F11-MVA MERS or mH5-MVA MERS and boosted
with the same vaccine after three weeks. Serum samples from 21 d.
p.i. (post-prime) or 42 d.p.i. (post-boost) were collected and evalu-
ated in ELISA and MERSpp neutralisation assays. At 21 d.p.i. F11-
MVA MERS and mH5-MVA induced similar levels of S1-specific
Fig. 2. Antibody responses to ChAdOx1 MERS vaccine candidates. BALB/c mice (n = 6) were immunised intramuscularly with 1 � 108 IU ChAdOx1 MERS that either encodes or
lacks tPA signal peptide upstream of the antigen sequence. A control group of mice were immunised with ChAdOx1 expressing eGFP instead of MERS-CoV S gene (given at
1 � 108 IU intramuscularly). Serum samples were collected at 14 and 28 days post immunisation (d.p.i.). S1-binding antibodies were measured by ELISA (A) and
neutralisation activity of the antibodies were confirmed by MERS-CoV pseudotyped viral particles (MERSpp) neutralisation assay (B) or neutralisation assay (C). Individual
data points (representing individual mice) are shown with line as the median. Data are representative of two independent experiments. Statistical significance by Kruskal–
Wallis test is shown.

were performed to determine the percentage of splenic IFN-c secreting CD4+ and CD8+ after in vitro re-stimulation with a MERS-CoV S-specific peptide. Individual data points

 antibodies (mean endpoint titre (Log10) = 3.2 and 2.8 respectively;
Fig. 5A). At 42 d.p.i S1-specific antibody levels had increased to 4.7
and 4.8 respectively (Fig. 5A). The titres of nAb (MERS pp assay)
were also similar for both vaccines (mean titre IC90 (Log10) = 2.71
(F11-MVA MERS) and 2.76 respectively; Fig. 5B). Utilising different
promoters in MVA vectors did not result in differences in the
induced antibody levels. However, at 42 d.p.i. IFN-c secreting
splenocytes induced by F11-MVA MERS were statistically signifi-
cantly higher than those of mH5-MVA MERS ((Median = 525 and
249 SFU/106 splenocytes, respectively, Fig. 5C). Both MVA vaccines
induced similar vector-specific immune responses as expected
(Fig. 5D and E).
4. Discussion
Vaccines against MERS-CoV have been developed and tested in
a number of animal models (including non-human primates [42–
44] and camels [45]) as well as in human clinical trials [46]. All
vaccine candidates focused on the spike antigen because it con-
tains the receptor-binding domain used for cell entry by the virus,
against which neutralising antibodies may be induced, and it is
conserved. Therefore, the improvement of MERS-CoV vaccines
focuses on platform and vaccination regimens rather than antigen
selection and optimisation. Here, we focused on using the same
antigen (transgene) to develop a vaccine against MERS-CoV, and

vaccine candidates utilise either the mH5 or F11 promoter for transgene expression. Serum samples were collected at 28 (post-prime) and 42 (post-boost) d.p.i. S1-binding
antibodies were measured by ELISA (A) and neutralisation activity of serum antibodies at 42 d.p.i. were confirmed by MERSpp neutralisation assay (B). At 42 d.p.i, IFN-c
ex vivo ELISpot (C) or Intracellular Cytokine Staining (ICS (D)) were performed to determine the percentage of CD8+ IFN-c+ splenocytes after in vitro re-stimulation with a
MERS-CoV S-specific peptide. ICS of splenocytes re-stimulated with MVA-specific peptides (F(G)2 and E3) was also performed (E and F). Individual data points (representing
individual mice) are shown with line as the median. Data are representative of two independent experiments. Statistical significance by Kruskal–Wallis test is shown.
Symbols are closed squares (j) for ChAdOx1 prime responses, open circles (s) for mH5-MVA boost responses, and closed circles (d) for F11-MVA boost responses.

 to assess different vectors, different versions of each vector, and
different vaccination regimens. We generated a number of MERS-
CoV vaccine candidates based on the same codon optimized spike
transgene and ensured its expression in vitro before we evaluated
the humoral and cellular immunogenicity in a pre-clinical BALB/c
mouse model. ChAdOx1 based vaccine candidates were produced
with or without tPA. The tPA signal peptide was predicted to
enhance the humoral immunogenicity of encoded vaccine anti-
gens, based on previous reports [29]. Our data supported this
hypothesis and showed a significant increase in the S1-specific
antibody levels at 28 d.p.i. The level of neutralising antibodies
was also increased when tPA was utilised. However, ChAdOx1
MERS without tPA was still a potent vaccine candidate, inducing
a high level of both S1-specific binding antibodies and MERS-CoV
neutralising antibodies. Neutralisation activity of mouse serum
antibodies was assayed by using MERS-CoV pseudotyped viral par-
ticles (MERSpp), an approach used by a number of researchers for
other human pathogens such as HIV, Influenza, and HCV to over-
come the necessity of handling BSL-3 viruses [40]. Additionally,
we confirmed the ability of serum samples from vaccinated mice
Fig. 5. Humoral and cellular immunogenicity of homologous MVA MERS vaccination. BALB/c mice (n = 6) were immunised intramuscularly with 1 � 106 pfu MVA MERS, in a
homologous prime-boost vaccination with three-weeks interval between vaccination. MVA MERS vaccine candidates utilise either the mH5 or F11 promoter for transgene
expression. Serum samples were collected at 21 (post-prime) and 42 (post-boost) d.p.i. S1-binding antibodies were measured by ELISA (A) and neutralisation activity of
serum antibodies at 42 d.p.i. were confirmed by MERSpp neutralisation assay (B). At 42 d.p.i splenocytes were processed and re-stimulated with a MERS-CoV S-specific
peptide (CD8+ T cell specific) for IFN-c ex vivo ELISpot (C). ICS of splenocytes re-stimulated with MVA-specific peptides (F(G)2 and E3) was also performed (D and E) as was
performed in Fig. 4. Individual data points (representing individual mice) are shown with line as the median. Data are representative of two independent experiments.
Statistical significance by Kruskal–Wallis test is shown. Symbols are open circles (s) for mH5-MVA and closed circles (d) for F11-MVA.

 to neutralise live MERS virus. We therefore selected ChAdOx1
MERS with tPA (simply referred to ChAdOx1 MERS) for further
evaluation.
ChAdOx1 MERS also induced cellular responses for MERS S,
with polyfunctional CD8+ T cells detected in the spleen of immu-
nised mice. This supports the potency of the ChAdOx1 viral vector
in inducing T cellular immunity, observed previously in animal
models [26,32,47] as well as in humans [33]. Following ChAdOx1
prime/MVA boost, MVA significantly boosted the neutralising anti-
body titres to higher levels. No difference in humoral immunity
was found when either the F11 or mH5 promoter was used.
Regarding the promoter effect on MVA cellular immunogenicity,
we have previously reported that utilising the F11 promoter
enhanced malaria and influenza antigens in MVA [31]. Here, we
again report that F11-MVA MERS induced higher T cell responses
than mH5-MVA MERS in a homologous prime-boost MVA MERS
vaccination.
All of our vaccine candidates induced humoral (with nAb) and
cellular immune (with polyfunctional CD8+ T cell) responses
against MERS-CoV spike antigen. Modest effects on immunogenic-
ity of different versions of the vaccines were noted, with the use of
the tPA leader sequence in ChAdOx1, and the use of the F11 pro-
moter in MVA producing small increases in immunogenicity com-
pared to no leader sequence, or the mH5 promoter. The protective
level of either antibodies or cellular immunity required to counter
MERS-CoV infection in humans or in animal models is not yet
defined, despite some efforts [48–51]. The ideal vaccine would pro-
vide rapid onset of immunity and complete protective efficacy after
a single dose, with a long duration of immunity. Complete protec-
tive efficacy of one dose of ChAdOx1 expressing the external glyco-
protein of Rift Valley Fever Virus has been demonstrated in multiple
species and it is already known that ChAdOx1 RVF is highly
immunogenic in camels [32]. To date, the only vaccine against
MERS to be tested in camels is an MVA vectored vaccine [41] which
was protective in hDPP4 transgenic mice immunised with a homol-
ogous prime/boost regimen [37] but in camels required two doses
given both intranasally and intramuscularly to provide partial pro-
tection and reduction of virus shedding [45]. Here we find that a
single dose of ChAdOx1 MERS is as immunogenic as two doses of
MVA MERS, suggesting that this regimen should be tested for pro-
tective efficacy in camels. However if this is not completely protec-
tive, administration of MVA MERS as a heterologous boost should
be considered next. In our hands one dose of MVA resulted in an
endpoint titre of 3 logs, two doses of MVA produced 4.7 logs, one
dose of ChAdOx1 produced 5 logs, and ChAdOx1/MVA prime boost
produced 5.9 logs. If a single dose of ChAdOx1 MERs is not protec-
tive and a two dose regimen is required, ChAdOx1/MVA would be
more likely to provide complete protection than MVA/MVA.
ChAdOx1 MERS should now be evaluated for immunogenicity
and efficacy in larger animal species, including both camels and
humans.
