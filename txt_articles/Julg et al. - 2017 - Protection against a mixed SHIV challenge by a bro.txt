HIV-1 sequence diversity presents a major challenge for the clinical development of broadly neutralizing anti-
bodies (bNAbs) for both therapy and prevention. Sequence variation in critical bNAb epitopes has been ob-
served in most HIV-1–infected individuals and can lead to viral escape after bNAb monotherapy in humans.
We show that viral sequence diversity can limit both the therapeutic and prophylactic efficacy of bNAbs in
rhesus monkeys. We first demonstrate that monotherapy with the V3 glycan-dependent antibody 10-1074,
but not PGT121, results in rapid selection of preexisting viral variants containing N332/S334 escape mutations
and loss of therapeutic efficacy in simian-HIV (SHIV)–SF162P3–infected rhesus monkeys. We then show that the
V3 glycan-dependent antibody PGT121 alone and the V2 glycan-dependent antibody PGDM1400 alone both fail
to protect against a mixed challenge with SHIV-SF162P3 and SHIV-325c. In contrast, the combination of both
bNAbs provides 100% protection against this mixed SHIV challenge. These data reveal that single bNAbs effi-
ciently select resistant viruses from a diverse challenge swarm to establish infection, demonstrating the impor-
tance of bNAb cocktails for HIV-1 prevention.
INTRODUCTION
Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) against HIV-1 Env are cur-
rently being developed for both HIV-1 prevention and therapy (1, 2).
However, HIV-1 diversity presents a major challenge for the clinical de-
velopment of bNAbs. Recent studies have demonstrated that bNAb
monotherapy in chronically HIV-1–infected individuals rapidly selects
for resistant viral variants (3–7), suggesting that cocktails of bNAbs will
be required for effective therapeutic strategies. However, the question of
whether multiple bNAbs will be required to protect against acquisition
of infection has not previously been studied in detail.
Previous studies in nonhuman primates that have demonstrated
bNAb-mediated protection against simian-HIV (SHIV) challenge
have typically used single challenge viruses (8–10). During sexual trans-
mission of HIV-1 across mucosal barriers, however, exposure to
a swarm of viral variants is common, although only a small number of
founder viruses typically establish the infection (11, 12). These data
suggest that bNAb combinations may be required for HIV-1 preven-
tion strategies.
Here, we explored whether single bNAbs would select for resistant
SHIV variants in both therapeutic and prophylactic experiments in
rhesus monkeys. We also evaluated whether a bNAb cocktail would
be required to protect against a mixed SHIV challenge. We selected the
V3 glycan-specific antibody PGT121 and the V2 glycan-specific antibody
PGDM1400 (13, 14) for this study because these bNAbs target differ-
ent epitopes and are both currently being evaluated in clinical trials
(NCT02960581 and NCT03205917).
RESULTS
Rapid viral escape from single bNAb therapy
It has been hypothesized that certain bNAbs, such as the V3 glycan-
dependent antibody PGT121 (14), might have an intrinsically higher
bar to escape than other bNAbs targeting this epitope (15) as a result
of making multiple glycan contacts on the Env surface, a phenomenon
termed “glycan promiscuity” (16). We therefore first compared the
therapeutic efficacy of two related V3 glycan-dependent antibodies,
PGT121 and 10-1074 (14, 17), in chronically SHIV-SF162P3–infected
rhesus monkeys. Animals were infected with SHIV-SF162P3 about
7 months before a single infusion with PGT121 [10 mg/kg intravenously
(iv)] (n = 4) or 10-1074 (10 mg/kg iv) (n = 2). Both antibodies had
comparable neutralizing potency against SHIV-SF162P3 in vitro [IC50
(median inhibitory concentration) of 0.1 mg/ml for 10-1074 and IC50 of
0.1 mg/ml for PGT121] but resulted in markedly different therapeutic
efficacy in vivo (Fig. 1). Consistent with our previous findings (15),
PGT121 infusion resulted in up to a 3-log reduction of plasma viral loads
to undetectable levels, which was followed by viral rebound when
PGT121 titers declined to subtherapeutic levels. In contrast, 10-1074 in-
fusion resulted in only a transient 1.5-log decline of plasma viral loads
followed by rapid viral rebound to baseline levels by day 14, which is
comparable to the reported efficacy of 10-1074 in SHIV-AD8–infected
monkeys (18) and in HIV-1–infected humans (6).
Viralsequencing by single-genome amplification (SGA) after 10-1074
infusion demonstrated the emergence of Env mutations at critical con-
tact sites (N332D/T/S/I/K and S334N/R), which eliminate the N-linked
glycan at position 332 (Fig. 2). These mutations were present at detect-
able but low levels in the challenge stock and baseline plasma samples
(Fig. 3A), suggesting that 10-1074 selected rare preexisting viral escape
variants. In contrast, no mutations were observed in the PGT121-treated
animals after rebound (fig. S1), consistent with our prior observations
(15). Moreover, an N332Apoint mutation in SHIV-SF162P3completely
abrogated 10-1074 neutralization activity in vitro but only partially re-
duced PGT121 neutralization activity (Fig. 3B). Together, these data

 suggest that PGT121 has a higher bar to escape than 10-1074 for
SHIV-SF162P3, presumably as a result of the ability of PGT121 to
make multiple glycan contacts on HIV-1 Env (16), and thus a single
N332/S334 point mutation in the context of SHIV-SF162P3 may be
insufficient to escape from PGT121.
Complementary HIV-1 coverage by PGT121 and PGDM1400
PGT121 covers about 60 to 70% of global viruses (14), and thus we
explored which bNAbs would complement PGT121 to improve global
virus coverage (19). PGDM1400 is a V2 glycan-dependent bNAb with
exceptional neutralizing potency and breadth (13). We evaluated the
neutralizing activity of PGT121, PGDM1400, and the combination of
PGT121 + PGDM1400 against a panel of 118 multiclade pseudo-
viruses in TZM-bl assays. PGDM1400 covered 77% of viruses in this
panel with an IC80 of 0.57 mg/ml, and PGT121 covered 60% of viruses
in this panel with an IC80 of 3.26 mg/ml (Fig. 4A). The combination of
both bNAbs neutralized 97% of pseudoviruses with an IC80 of 0.03 mg/ml,
indicating that the combination was substantially more potent than either
bNAb alone (P = 1.0 × 10−6 and P = 4.2 × 10−11 comparing IC80 titers for
the combination versus PGDM1400 alone and PGT121 alone, respec-
tively, Wilcoxon rank sum tests) and also had greater breadth than either
bNAb alone (P = 2.2 × 10−6 and P = 2.2 × 10−13 comparing breadth for
the combination versus PGDM1400 alone and PGT121 alone, respec-
tively, Fisher’s exact tests) (Fig. 4B). These data suggest a remarkable
complementarity between PGT121 and PGDM1400, as viruses resistant
to one of these antibodies are largely susceptible to the other antibody.
The combination of PGT121 + PGDM1400 covered 97 to 100% of viruses
from clades A, B, C, and CRF01 in this global panel (Fig. 4C). More-
over, the combination led to complete (>95%) neutralization of 86% of
viruses in this panel, as compared with 59% for PGDM1400 and 53% for
PGT121 (P = 9.3 × 10−6 and P = 5.1 × 10−8, respectively, Fisher’s exact
tests) (fig. S2).
In vivo protection against mixed SHIV challenge
The complementarity of PGT121 and PGDM1400 in vitro suggests
the combination of these two bNAbs as an HIV-1 prevention strategy.
We therefore evaluated the protective efficacy of PGDM1400 alone,
PGT121 alone, or the combination of PGT121 + PGDM1400 in
rhesus monkeys against a mixed SHIV challenge with the clade B
SHIV-SF162P3 (20) and the clade C SHIV-325c (21). SHIV-
SF162P3 was sensitive in vitro to PGT121 but resistant to PGDM1400,
whereas SHIV-325c was sensitive in vitro to PGDM1400 but resistant to
PGT121 (Table 1). Twenty rhesus monkeys (n = 5 per group) were in-
fused with PGDM1400 (10 mg/kg iv), PGT121 (10 mg/kg iv), the
combination of PGT121 (5 mg/kg iv) + PGDM1400 (5 mg/kg iv),

 or phosphate-buffered saline as control. Animals were challenged the
following day by the intrarectal route with 500 TCID50 (median tissue
culture infectious dose) of SHIV-SF162P3 + 500 TCID50 of SHIV-325c.
Pharmacokinetics of the two bNAbs was similar by both idiotype-
specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and virus-
specific neutralizing antibody (NAb) assays (figs. S3 to S5).
After challenge, all sham control animals became infected with peak
plasma viral loads of 6.60 to 7.73 log RNA copies/ml on day 14 (Fig. 5).
Similarly, 100% (five of five) of animals that received PGDM1400 alone
became infected with peak plasma viral loads of 5.46 to 7.74 log RNA
copies/ml, and 100% (five of five) of animals that received PGT121
alone also became infected but with lower peak plasma viral loads of
3.97 to 5.26 log RNA copies/ml. In contrast, 0% (zero of five) of animals
that received the combination of PGT121 + PGDM1400 exhibited de-
tectable plasma viral loads (>50 RNA copies/ml) at any point in time
(Fig. 5), indicating that only the PGT121 + PGDM1400 combination
protected against this mixed SHIV challenge (P = 0.008 comparing
the combination group with either the PGDM1400 alone group or
the PGT121 alone group, Fisher’s exact test).
Viral sequencing by SGA at weeks 2 to 6 after challenge indicated
that 100% of clones in the PGT121-treated animals were SHIV-325c,
whereas 100% of clones in the PGDM1400-treated animals were SHIV-
SF162P3 (Fig. 6 and Table 2), consistent with the resistance patterns of
these viruses (Table 1). The sham controls were detectably infected with
only SHIV-SF162P3 (Fig. 6 and Table 2), which has greater replication
capacity than SHIV-325c. These findings were confirmed by strain-
specific reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
assays (figs. S6 and S7), demonstrating that each bNAb alone efficiently
selected resistant variants from the challenge swarm for the establish-
ment of primary infection.

 Diversity of HIV-1 sequences in target bNAb epitopes
We next evaluated the variation in key PGDM1400 and PGT121 con-
tact and signature positions in HIV-1–infected humans. Signature resi-
dues were resolved by a phylogenetically corrected strategy using large
panelsofMgrouporCcladeviruses,andcontactsiteswerefoundby struc-
tural modeling using structures of PGT145 and PGT122 complexed with
HIV-1 Env and of PGDM1400 and PGT121 Fabs (fig. S8) (13, 22–24). The
variation of key signature residues at contact sites for PGDM1400 and
PGT121 binding to HIV-1 Env from multiple clades was then defined
(figs. S9 and S10). In these logo plots, O represents an Asn that occurs
in a potential N-linked glycosylation site (PNGS).
We assessed sequence variability in these key PGDM1400 and
PGT121 signature positions in 10 HIV-1–infected individuals who
had been sampled longitudinally and for whom there were >150 full-length
published env sequences in the Los Alamos Sequence Database. The key
N332 PNGS for PGT121 exhibited variability in 8 of 10 individuals,
including those with primarily sensitive virus, and the D325 site showed
variability in 7 of 10 individuals (Fig. 7 and table S1). D325 is a key con-
tact residue, and a D325A substitution can reduce neutralization sen-
sitivity by ninefold and can completely abrogate sensitivity in
conjunction with the loss of N332 glycosylation site (25). The key

 N160PNGSforPGDM1400was variable in only 3 of 10 individuals, but a
critical R166 signature was either variable or lost in 5 of 10 individuals,
and the key K/R169 positive charge was either variable or lost in 10 of 10
individuals(Fig. 7and table S1) (22).These findingsina random sample
of HIV-1–infected individuals suggest that diverse resistance profiles
evolve over time in HIV-1–infected humans.
DISCUSSION
Our data demonstrate that bNAbs can rapidly and specifically select for
resistant viral variants within a diverse challenge swarm, resulting in
efficient breakthrough infection with resistant SHIV strains. Both
PGDM1400 alone and PGT121 alone failed to protect against challenge
with a mixture of SHIV-SF162P3 and SHIV-325c in rhesus monkeys,
whereas the combination of both bNAbs protected with 100% efficacy.
These findings suggest that a combination of bNAbs will be required to
provide optimal protection against acquisition of HIV-1 infection.
All the sham controls exhibited only SHIV-SF162P3 replication by
both SGA and subtype-specific RT-PCR assays. The absence of detect-
able SHIV-325c replication in the sham controls suggests that SHIV-
SF162P3 has higher replicative capacity than SHIV-325c in vivo,
although we cannot exclude the possibility that a low level of SHIV-
325c replication occurred in these animals below the level of detection
(<50 copies/ml). In the presence of PGT121 selection pressure, how-
ever, robust infection with SHIV-325c occurred in 100% of animals.
These findings are consistentwith the observation that duringprimary
HIV-1 infection, transmitted founder viruses with higher replication
rates are selected from a mixed swarm (26). However, whether bNAb-
mediated selection of resistant viral variants occurs entirely at the mu-
cosal site of inoculation or at distal sites of early infection (27, 28)
remains to be determined.
Multiple previous studies have shown that single bNAbs and bNAb
combinations robustly protect against SHIV challenges in rhesus
monkeys (8–10), presumably as a result of relatively limited viral
sequence diversity in most SHIV challenge stocks. Our findings suggest
that the increased viral diversity observed in HIV-1 swarms may
compromise the efficacy of single bNAbs for prevention of acquisition
of HIV-1 infection, as a result of a greater frequency of resistant viral
variants and the remarkable efficiency of bNAbs to select resistant
viruses within a swarm. In the plasma viruses of the 10 randomly
selected individuals that we analyzed, variations in key PGDM1400
and PGT121 contact and signature positions were frequent. Moreover,
bNAbs rapidly select minor resistant variants in chronically infected
hosts, as shown here for 10-1074, as well as in prior studies in SHIV-
infected rhesus monkeys (18) and HIV-1–infected humans (3–7), al-
though certain bNAbs such as PGT121 may have a higher bar to escape
than 10-1074 against a subset of viruses. PGT121 and PGDM1400, both
alone and in combination, are currently being explored in clinical trials
(NCT02960581 and NCT03205917). A recent study has similarly
shown that a trispecific Env antibody can also protect against a mixed
SHIV challenge (29).
A limitation of this study is that two SHIVs might not be repre-
sentative of a diverse HIV-1 swarm. In addition, this study assessed only
one bNAb combination, and thus, testing additional bNAb combina-
tions against mixed SHIV challenges will be required to further define
the generalizability of our findings. Together, these data demonstrate
the importance of developing bNAb cocktails for both prevention
and therapy of HIV-1 infection to cover viral diversity and resistant var-
iants within diverse viral populations.

 MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals and study design
Theoverallobjectiveof thisstudy wasto investigatethe protective efficacy
of PGDM1400 and PGT121, alone or in combination, against a challenge
with two SHIVs in rhesus monkeys. One additional study was performed
to test the therapeutic activity of the antibodies PGT121 and 10-1074 in
chronically SHIV-SF162P3–infected macaques. Animals were randomly
allocated to groups, and virologic data were generated blinded. Placebo
controls (saline) were used for the protection study. Five animals per
group were used, similar to previous studies (10, 30, 31). The number
of animals analyzed is stated in the figure legends. Primary data can be
found in the figures. All animal studies were approved by the appro-
priate Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Monkeys were
housed at Bioqual and Alpha Genesis.
Single SHIV treatment study
Six outbred, Indian-origin male and female rhesus monkeys (Macaca
mulatta) were genotyped and selected as negative for the protective ma-
jor histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I alleles Mamu-A*01,
Mamu-B*08, and Mamu-B*17. Tripartite motif-containing protein 5
(TRIM5) polymorphisms were balanced equally among groups.
Animals were chronically infected with SHIV-SF162P3 and received
PGT121 (10 mg/kg iv) or 10-1074 (10 mg/kg iv).
Double SHIV challenge study
Twenty outbred, Indian-origin male and female rhesus monkeys
(M. mulatta) were genotyped and selected as negative for the protective
MHC class I alleles Mamu-A*01, Mamu-B*08, and Mamu-B*17. TRIM5
polymorphisms were balanced equally among groups. Animals received
PGT121 (5 to 10 mg/kg iv), PGDM1400 (5 to 10 mg/kg iv), or both

 and were challenged intrarectally with 500 TCID50 of SHIV-SF162P3 +
500 TCID50 of SHIV-325c. Generation of these SHIV stocks has been
previously described (20, 21, 32).
Antibodies
10-1074, PGT121, and PGDM1400 were produced, as previously de-
scribed (14), and purified by Protein A affinity matrix (GE Healthcare).
All the monoclonal antibody preparations were endotoxin-free.
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays
PGDM1400 and PGT121 antibody titers were measured by a quantita-
tive ELISA, as previously described (14), using anti-idiotypic antibody-
coated microtiter plates to capture the monoclonal antibodies followed
by detection using a horseradish peroxidase–conjugated anti-human
immunoglobulin G antibody.
TZM-bl neutralization assays
Neutralization of the two SHIV challenge stocks was evaluated in vitro by
using TZM-bl target cells and a luciferase reporter assay as described (33).
Viral RNA assays
Plasma SHIV RNA levels were measured using a gag-targeted quanti-
tative real-time RT-PCR assay, and tissue levels of SHIV RNA and
DNA were measured using gag-targeted, nested quantitative hybrid
real-time/digital RT-PCR and PCR assays, as previously described (15).
Strain-specific RT-PCR assays
Viral RNA was reverse-transcribed using the universal SHIV primer
vl-EnvR (5′-CAATAATTGTCTGGCCTGTACCGTC-3′). Probes
and primers were designed to target the specific regions of either
SHIV-SF162P3 or SHIV-325c. Primers including SF162P3 vl-EnvF

GAAATA-3′) linked to FAM and BHQ (Biosearch Technologies)
were used for SHIV-SF162P3–specific viral load assay; primers includ-
ing 325C vl-EnvF (5′-CGGGAAACATAACATGTAGATCAAA-3′),
vl-EnvR (5′-TTCTCCCTTTTCTCCTCCATCA-3′), and probe
(5′-ACAGGACTACTGGTGACAC-3′) linked to Cy5 (Integrated DNA
Technologies) were used for SHIV-325c–specific viral load assay.
SHIV-SF162P3 deep sequencing
Env amplicon deep sequencing was performed using pairs of primers
designed to target V3 and V2 regions of SHIV-SF162P3 Env. SHIV-
SF162P3 RNA was isolated and reverse-transcribed by SF162P3
NGS-V3R (5′-TTCTGGGTCCCCTCCTGAGG-3′). Primers including
NGS-V3F (5′-GTACAGCTGAAGGAATCTGTAG-3′) and NGS-V3R
were used for V3 amplification; primers including NGS V2F (5′-GTA-
ATTGGAAAGAGATGAACAGAGGAG-3′) and NGS V2R (5′-GG-
GCACAATAATGTATGGGAATTGG-3′) were used for V2 amplification.
NEBNext DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (New England Biolabs)
was used for V3 and V2 amplicon library preparation on the basis of the
manufacturer’s protocols. Illumina MiSeq Sequencing 150–base pair
paired-end (PE150) was performed by the Dana-Farber Cancer Insti-
tute Molecular Biology Core Facility.
Sequence analysis
Adaptor sequences and low-quality bases (quality scores < 30) were re-
moved from Illumina sequences using BBDuk from the BBTools suite
(http://jgi.doe.gov/data-and-tools/bbtools). The following adaptor se-
quences were used: 5′-AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTA-
CACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT-3′ and its
complement (the NEBnext “universal” primer), 5′-CAAGCAGAAGA-
CGGCATACGAGAT-CACTGT-GTGACTGGAGTTCA-
GACGTGTGCTCTTCCGATC-3′ (for the V2 sequences) and 5′-
CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGAT-TCAAGT-GTGACTG-
GAGTTCAGACGTGTGCTCTTCCGATC-3′ (for the V3 sequences)
(two index primers), and their reverse complements (dash characters
delimit the complements of the sequencing bar codes). Adaptor
trimming used the parameters “ktrim=r k=27 mink=4 hdist=2 tpe
tbo”; quality trimming used “qtrim=rltrimq=30.” Paired-end sequences
were aligned against SF162P3 Env using Bowtie 2 (http://bowtie-bio.
sourceforge.net/bowtie2/index.shtml; version 2.1.0, parameters
“–very-sensitive-local–reorder”), sorted and indexed using SAMtools,
processed into paired-end FASTA files, and translated into amino acids
using custom Perl code (wfischer@lanl.gov). PCR primer–derived se-
quences were removed by visual inspection of translated sequences (V3-F,
VQLKESV; V3-R, SGGDPE; V2-F, NWKEMNRG; V2-R, PIPIHYCA)
using AliView (34). Sequences were removed from the data set if they were
not complete throughout the regions of interest or if they contained stop co-
dons. PNGSs were computed by matches to the recognition sequence
N-x-[ST], where x represents any amino acid other than proline, and
represented in alignments by the letter O. Finally, columns matching
signature positions were extracted from the alignment on the basis of
HXB2 numbering (www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/sequence/LOCATE/
locate.html and the Protein Data Bank entry 5FYJ, chain G).
Single-genome amplification
SGA assays were performed essentially as described (11) except that the
primers used here were designed to target conserved region of SHIV-
SF162P3 and SHIV-325c. Briefly, viral RNA was isolated and reverse-
transcribed to viral complementary DNA (cDNA) using SHIV SGA
EnvR1 (5′-CAATAATTGTCTGGCCTGTACCGTC-3′). First-round
PCR was carried out with Q5 High-Fidelity 2X Master Mix (New England
Biolabs) together with primers SHIV SGA EnvF1 (5′-TATGGGG-
TACCTGTGTGGAA-3′) and SHIV SGA EnvR1. PCR conditions were
programmed as follows: 1 cycle of 98°C for 30 s, 35 cycles of 98°C for
15 s, 55°C for 15 s, and 72°C for 55 s, followed by a final extension of
72°C for 2 min. One microliter of first-round PCR product was added
to Q5 Master Mix with primers SHIV SGA EnvF2 (5′-GCCTGTGTACC-
CACAGAC-3′) and EnvR2 (5′-ATAGTGCTTCCTGCTGC-3′). PCR
conditions were programmed as above but increased to 45 cycles for the
second step. Amplicons from cDNA dilutions resulting in less than 30%
positive were considered to result from amplification of a single cDNA
amplification and were processed for sequencing. For each sample, 15 to
30 sequences were analyzed.
Env contact sites for PGDM1400
Because no structuresexist for PGDM1400 in complex with Env trimers,
a cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the related anti-
body PGT145 in complex with Env trimer (22) and structural modeling
was used to find Env contact sites for PGDM1400. The heavy-chain
complementarity-determining region3(HCDR3)fromthecrystalstruc-
ture of the PGDM1400 Fab (13) to the PGT145 Fab was aligned using
positions 88 to 108 and the “align” function from PyMOL. All Env
amino acids and glycans that had any heavy atoms within 8.5 Å of
PGDM1400heavyatomswereisolated.ThelistbelowshowsPGDM1400

sites are shared between PGDM1400 and PGT145, with 119, 129, 130,

 and 158 in contact with PGT145 alone and 200 and 314 in contact with
PGDM1400 alone. When the PGDM1400 contact sites contained amino
acidsthat were significantly associated withsensitivity or resistance with a
q value of <0.2, they are shown below in bold, and these are the positions
that were tracked globally and within subjects using published longitudi-
nalsequencingdata(Fig.4).Positions160to162compriseaglycosylation
site with the motif Nx[ST] that is essential for an Env to be sensitive to
PGDM1400 neutralization. A positive charge at position 169 was also
particularly highly significantly associated with PGDM1400 sensitivity.
The other sites (161, 165, 166, and 167) had significant but more modest
associations. PGDM1400 contact sites: 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126,
127, 128, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171,
200, 309, 312, 313, 314, and 315.
Env contact sites for PGT121
Because no structures exist for PGT121 in complex with Env trimers, a
cryo-EM structure of the related antibody PGT122 in complex with Env
trimer (23) was used, and the contact surface of PGT121 on the SOSIP
trimer was modeled. Specifically, HCDR3 from the crystal structure of
the PGT121 Fab (24) to the PGT122 Fab was aligned using positions 88
to 101 and the align function from PyMOL. Then, all Env amino acids
and glycans that had any heavy atoms within 8.5 Å of PGT121/PGT122
Fab heavy atoms were isolated. These contact sites are listed below. Env
sequences in hypervariable region of V1 cannot be aligned, so standard
signature analysis on this region was not performed, and these positions
are shown in italics. The contact sites with significant PGT121
resistance signatures (q < 0.2) are shown below in bold. PGT121 contact
sites: 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 138A, 138B, 138C, 138D, 138E, 151,
152, 154, 175, 296, 297, 298, 299, 300, 301, 302, 322, 322A, 323, 324,
325, 326, 327, 328, 329, 330, 331, 332, 385, 414, 415, 416, 417, 418,
and 419. PGT121 glycan sites: 156, 301, 332, 392, 413, and 442.
Several strong signatures that were not directly in the contact surface
were also included. The PNGS at 295 is a favored signature for PGT121,
but it is not present in this particular structure. The PNGS at 334, which
is often gained when the key signature site of the PNGS at N332 is lost,
was also included. The signature sites were then resolved using a phy-
logenetically corrected strategy (35, 36) to identify amino acid in key
positions that are associated with either resistance or sensitivity to
PGT121 to large panels of 207 M group or 200 C clade viruses.
Statistical analyses
Analyses of independent data were performed by Wilcoxon rank sum
tests, and comparisons of categorical variables were performed using
Fisher’s exact tests. P values less than 0.05 were considered significant.
Combination IC80 titers were calculated using the Bliss-Hill model,
which has been shown to provide accurate predictions of combination
neutralization properties using those of individual bNAbs (19). Sta-
tistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism or the Stats
module in SciPy (www.scipy.org). MEGA6 was used to do the single-
genome sequence alignments and create the maximum likelihood tree.
