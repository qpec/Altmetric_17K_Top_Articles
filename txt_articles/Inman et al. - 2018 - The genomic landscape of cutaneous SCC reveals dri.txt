Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) has a high tumour mutational burden (50
mutations per megabase DNA pair). Here, we combine whole-exome analyses from 40
primary cSCC tumours, comprising 20 well-differentiated and 20 moderately/poorly differ-
entiated tumours, with accompanying clinical data from a longitudinal study of immuno-
suppressed and immunocompetent patients and integrate this analysis with independent
gene expression studies. We identify commonly mutated genes, copy number changes and
altered pathways and processes. Comparisons with tumour differentiation status suggest
events which may drive disease progression. Mutational signature analysis reveals the pre-
sence of a novel signature (signature 32), whose incidence correlates with chronic exposure
to the immunosuppressive drug azathioprine. Characterisation of a panel of 15 cSCC tumour-
derived cell lines reveals that they accurately reflect the mutational signatures and genomic
alterations of primary tumours and provide a valuable resource for the validation of tumour
drivers and therapeutic targets.

 T
he incidence of keratinocyte skin cancers in fair skinned
populations currently exceeds that of all other cancers
combined and is increasing year on year in our ageing
population. More than one million new cases of cutaneous
squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) are diagnosed annually in the
US, with significant health economic implications1. In contrast to
most other epithelial malignancies, more than a third of patients
develop multiple primary cSCC. This is especially true in
immunosuppressed individuals with evidence in organ transplant
recipients (OTR) of a more than 100-fold increased risk of
developing cSCC2. Although many cSCC are effectively treated
with surgery or radiotherapy, morbidity is significant, particularly
as tumours frequently occur on cosmetically sensitive sites.
Metastasis occurs in ~5% of cases and cSCC is responsible for
approximately one-quarter of skin cancer-related deaths and
estimates for annual mortality are similar to those for melanoma
in parts of the USA3. There are few effective treatments for
advanced cSCC, with five-year survival of less than 30% reported
for metastatic disease4.
Cutaneous SCC is poorly understood at a molecular level and the
drivers of disease progression have not been fully elucidated. Whole-
exome sequencing (WES) has revealed a high mutation rate with on
average 50 mutations per megabase pair DNA5. Additionally, gross
chromosomal aberrations and numerous copy number alterations
(CNA) indicative of genetic instability create a complex molecular
landscape. Epidemiological and clinical evidence supports cumula-
tive life time exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR) as the principle
environmental carcinogen responsible for cSCC and the majority of
mutations found in cSCC contain a ‘UV signature’. Our under-
standing of the genomic landscape of cSCC is further complicated by
keratinocyte clones in apparently normal sun-exposed skin6 bearing
mutations in cSCC tumour suppressor genes (TSGs) such as
NOTCH1/2 and TP535,7–10. There is evidence that the mutational
profile of cSCC harbours similarities to those of other epithelial
tumours, including head and neck, lung and oesophageal SCCs
(reviewed in ref. 11) and the squamous subtype of pancreatic SCC12,
but comparisons are limited by small cSCC data sets.
Analyses of the patterns of mutations in cancer genomes has
revealed the presence of distinct ‘mutational signatures’13,14. They
are described using a simple classification based on the six classes of
single base mutations in combination with the base 5' and 3' to each
mutation and characteristic UVR-induced C > T mutations at
pyrimidines appear to predominate in all cSCC studies to date
(COSMIC signature 7).
Here, we perform WES of 40 primary cSCC from both
immunosuppressed (IS) and immunocompetent (IC) patients
classified according to histological differentiation status (well-
differentiated vs. moderately/poorly differentiated categories). We
have taken an integrated bioinformatics approach with the
intention of identifying a limited number of actionable pathways
onto which this multiplicity of genetic events will converge. In
addition to mutational, chromosomal and clonality analyses, a
mutational signature analysis has been performed, revealing a
novel mutational signature associated with patients who have
been exposed to the immunosuppressive agent, azathioprine.
Furthermore, we describe the molecular characterisation of 15
primary cSCC cell lines. These reflect the mutational signatures,
mutational and genomic alteration profiles and gene expression
changes of primary tumours and provide a resource for investigating
the contribution of genes, pathways, and processes for cSCC
progression.
Results
Mutational burden and signatures. Forty cSCC samples from 37
patients (Supplementary Data 1) were analysed/reanalysed by
WES
(including
30
previously
described)5,15.
Twenty-nine
patients were organ transplant recipients receiving immunosup-
pressive drugs and one was immunosuppressed for Crohn’s dis-
ease.
This sample
set contained equal numbers
of well-
differentiated (WD) vs. poorly/moderately differentiated (MD/
PD) tumours (20 samples each). WES coverage averaged 54.3 ×
(range 25.8–79.1×) with 91% of bases covered > 10 × (range
73.5–97.8%) and 81.4% > 20 × (range 47.2–93%) (Supplementary
Data 2). We identified 71,242 somatic mutations in the tumours
(Supplementary Data 3). The number of nonsynonymous and
synonymous mutations varied across each group averaging
1795 somatic variants in WD (range 23–6867) and 1793 somatic
variants in MD/PD (range 13–5188) (Fig. 1a and Supplementary
Data 3). Computational analysis of patterns of somatic muta-
tions13 has enabled the identification of 30 distinct mutational
signatures from more than 12,000 samples from a wide range of
cancer types14,16,17 (for a complete set of currently known sig-
natures see http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/signatures). Many
of these signatures have been attributed to environmental expo-
sure to mutagens14,16–18. Mutational signature analysis was per-
formed on 37/40 of the cSCC whole-exome sequences (Fig. 1b
and Supplementary Data 4). Signature 7 was observed in
33 samples (Fig. 1b), which reflected the C > T mutations of
dipyrimidines and has previously been described as a ‘UVR sig-
nature’14 (Supplementary Fig. 1B). Twenty-one of these UVR
signature positive tumours were from confirmed sun exposed
sites (Fig. 1b; head and neck, wrist and hand, Supplementary
Data 1) and the remaining 12 were from sites which included the
leg, chest, shoulder and back, which may also have been sun
exposed (Supplementary Data 1). MD07, which displays no evi-
dence of UVR exposure, was isolated from the foot of the patient
and was, therefore, unlikely to be sun exposed (Fig. 1b and
Supplementary Data 1, 4).
A
previously
undescribed
mutational
signature,
termed
signature 32 here-after, was found in 27 samples from both the
WD and MD/PD tumours (Fig. 1b, orange bars). It is
predominately C > T mutations (75%) in combination with C
> A, T > A, and T > C mutations (Fig. 1c). There seems to be a
clear presence for C > X at ApCpN and T > X at GpTpN. This
novel mutational signature exhibits a very strong transcriptional
strand bias potentially indicating an interplay with transcription
coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER) due to adducts on
guanine and adenine (Supplementary Fig. 1A). The pattern of
signature 32 is distinct from any of the previously known
COSMIC mutational signatures, including signatures that have a
pattern of mutations with predominately C > T transitions such
as signature 7. Only two of the COSMIC mutational signatures
exhibit a correlation > 0.5 between their respective patterns and
that of signature 32. The pattern of signature 30 (attributed to
mutations in the base excision repair gene NTHL119) has a
correlation of 0.58 with signature 32 and that of signature 11
(attributed to exposure to alkylating agents13,14) has a correlation
of 0.65 with signature 32. These correlations are lower than those
of other distinct COSMIC signatures, for example COSMIC
signatures 1 and 6 have a correlation of 0.8113,14. Further,
signatures 11 and 30 do not exhibit the same transcriptional
strand bias as signature 32. Thus, signature 32 is an entirely
novel mutational signature.
Signature 32 was prominent in many of the samples from
immunosuppressed patients (Fig. 1b) indicating a potential
association with exposure to immunosuppressant drugs. Most
immunosuppressed patients received azathioprine (Fig. 1b)
although this was usually part of a complex regimen involving
at least one other immunosuppressive drug (Supplementary
Data 1). However, three of the tumours with signature 32 were
from patients who had received azathioprine alone (MD02,

 PD01, WD03) and both tumours analysed from immunosup-
pressed patients whom had not received azathioprine (MD08,
WD15) did not exhibit mutational signature 32 (Fig. 1b and
Supplementary Data 1, 4). There is a significant association only
between a confirmed history of azathioprine exposure and the
presence

and
not

to
the
other
immunosuppressant drugs (Supplementary Fig. 2a). We did
not identify any other significant associations between any of the
mutational signatures and exposure to any of the immunosup-
pressant drugs (Supplementary Fig. 2b). Furthermore, analysis of
treatment times revealed a strong positive correlation with the
estimated time of azathioprine exposure and the prevalence of
signature 32 (Spearman’s rank order correlation rs(26) = 0.679,
p < 0.0001, Supplementary Fig. 3). Taken together these findings
indicate that chronic exposure to azathioprine correlates with the
presence of mutational signature 32. All tumours contained
lower levels of signatures 1 and 5, which are found in most
cancers and are attributed to so called ‘clock-like’ mutational
processes20 (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Data 4). Four tumour
samples also contained mutational signature contributions from

 and Supplementary Data 4), which are attributed to the activity
of the AID/APOBEC family of cytidine deaminases converting
cytosine to uracil14.
Somatic copy number aberrations. Somatic copy number aber-
rations (CNA) and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) events were
identified across WD and MD/PD samples (Supplementary
Data 5), with MD/PD samples having more large-scale genomic
events than WD samples (Fig. 2a, b). 62.5% of the samples (25/
40) had detectable copy number variations (CNVs) in at least 2
regions, which is consistent with previous observations21–24 with
a significant positive correlation with previous studies for top
frequent CNAs (Supplementary Fig. 4, Pearson’s correlation r =
0.37, p = 0.015). GISTIC25 analysis further identified significantly
amplified and deleted regions (q < 0.1, Supplementary Data 6),
including amplifications at 3q26, 5q22, 7q21, 11q22 and 15q11,
and deletions at 3p12, 5q13 and 9q21. Amplifications at 3q21–24,
5q21, 7q24, and copy losses at 3p21–24 and 5q24 have also pre-
viously reported. Frequent gain of 9q and loss of 9p are also
observed in this and previous studies of cSCC (Supplementary
Data 7).
Significantly mutated genes (SMGs) in cSCC. We employed
three statistical mutational significance methods; MutsigCV26
(significance cutoff p < 0.05, Supplementary Data 8), Oncodrive-
FM27 (significance cutoff q < 0.05, Supplementary Data 9) and
Oncodrive-CLUST28 (significance cutoff q < 0.05, Supplementary
Data 10). These identified 109, 97 and 171 SMGs respectively
totalling 351 unique genes (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Data 8–
10). We identified 22 SMGs by at least two methods (Fig. 3a, b).
This revealed recurrent mutations in a number of genes pre-
viously implicated in human cSCC including NOTCH1/2, TP53
and CDKN2A (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Data 11, 12, Supple-
mentary Fig. 5). The frequency and statistical significance of these
potential driver genes are consistent with previous exome10 and
targeted sequencing studies9 (Supplementary Data 13).
Additional SMGs included HRAS, MAP3K9, PTEN, SF3B1,
VPS41
and
WHSC1
(Fig.
3b, Supplementary
Fig.
6
and
Supplementary Data 14) all of which have known genetic
alterations in human malignancies29–38. We identified oncogenic
activating mutations in HRAS in three tumours (Fig. 3b and
Supplementary Fig. 6), which have previously been identified in
3–20% of cSCC9,10 (Supplementary Data 13) and keratoacantho-
mas (reviewed in ref. 4). Of note, 10% of the samples exhibit copy
number loss of HRAS (Fig. 3b), which has been observed by
others9, warranting a need for better understanding of the role of
HRAS in cSCC. PTEN alterations have been previously described
in cSCC9 (Supplementary Data 13), but the other SMGs including
FLNB,
GLIS3,
CACNA1C,
HERC6,
TRAPPC9,
MAPK1P1L
(Fig. 3b, Supplementary Fig. 7 and Supplementary Data 15),
GRHL2, CLCN3, TMEM51, ATP1A1, LCLAT1 and CRY1 (Fig. 3b,
Supplementary Fig. 8 and Supplementary Data 16) are of
unknown significance in cancer and present with no obvious
hotspot mutations. Non-silent mutations in a few of these SMGs
have also been observed in cSCC10 (Supplementary Data 13).
Comparison of the frequency of alterations in the 22 SMGs
between tumours isolated from immunosuppressed and immu-
nocompetent patients revealed no significant difference in
mutation frequencies indicating that tumours that arise in these
patient groups have common drivers (Fig. 3b and Supplementary
Data 17). Next, we assessed the probability for each mutational
somatic substitution in the 22 SMGs to be caused by each of the
operative mutational signatures. Overall the majority of the SMG
gene mutations are caused by azathioprine signature 32 (66.2%):
24.4% are due to UVR driven signature 7; 7.8% are caused by

 clock-like mutational signatures20 (signatures 1 and 5) and the
remaining 1.7% by APOBEC related signatures 2 and 13,
suggesting the driving mutational processes responsible for the
initiation and progression of the tumours in our sample set are
due to a combination of UVR and azathioprine exposure (Fig. 3c
and Supplementary Data 18).
Inference of clonal evolution and order of genetic changes.
Next, we performed clonal analysis, integrating somatic muta-
tions (SNVs and indels) and CNAs using EXPANDs39, and
SciClone40 which have been used to infer patterns of clonal
evolution41,42. In 35 of 40 cSCC, WES data were sufficient for the
identification of dominant clone and nested subpopulations in
each sample, thus allowing for the differentiation between clonal
and subclonal mutations. EXPANDS and SciClone had con-
cordant estimates of tumour purity (Supplementary Fig. 9,
Pearson’s
correlation
r = 0.9,
p = 3.42e-13,
Supplementary
Data 19). There was no correlation between the number of
somatic mutations identified in our samples and tumour purity
(Pearson’s correlation r = 0.10, p = 0.57). Clonality analysis
showed tumour heterogeneity across our samples, varying from 1
to 11 clones as estimated by EXPANDS (Fig. 4a) and 1 to 9
clones as estimated by SciClone (Fig. 4b) with some correlation
in the number of clusters estimated by the two methods (Sup-
plementary Fig. 10). 26/35 (74%) had at least two clones, 10/35
(29%) had at least three clones and 7/35 (20%) had at least five
clones identified by both programmes (Fig. 4a, b and Supple-
mentary Data 20) indicating a high degree of heterogeneity in
cSCC.
For the 22 SMGs, we assessed the order of driver mutation
acquisition inferred from the aggregate frequencies at which
they were found to be clonal or subclonal43. We characterised
the clonal and subclonal features of the nonsynonymous
mutations for these 22 genes with 74% of all clonal mutations
called by EXPANDS also identified as clonal by SciClone
(Supplementary Fig. 10). Over 70% of mutations in CDKN2A,
ATP1A1, HERC6, MAPK11P1L, GRHL2 and TP53 were clonal
using both methods implying alterations in these genes tended
to arise earlier during cSCC development (Fig. 4c, d). Rank
order of clonality similarly indicated that mutations in these
genes and also those in NOTCH1, TRAPPC9, FLNB and
MAP3K9 may also be early events, whereas mutations in HRAS,
VPS41,
GLIS3,
CACNA1C,
NOTCH2,
CLCN3,
LCLAT1,
TMEM51
and
SF3B1
appeared
to
accumulate
a
higher
proportion of subclonal nonsynonymous mutations (Fig. 4c, d
and Supplementary Data 21), indicating that lesions in these
genes are more likely to occur later.
Integration of genomic drivers and gene expression profiles. To
investigate potential tumour suppressor or tumour promoter
roles of our 22 SMGs and genes encoded within areas of sig-
nificant CNAs, we analysed gene expression profiles (GEP) in five
independent data sets comprising samples from normal skin,
actinic keratoses (AK) and SCC. These included GSE4521644
coupled with additional samples described here as Data set 1
(Supplementary Data 22), GSE4267745, GSE250346, GSE842937
and GSE3262821. GLIS3 and LCLAT1 were determined to have a
low level of expression in normal and/or lesional skin across
samples and were excluded from this analysis (see Methods). The
remaining 20 SMGs were clearly separated into two clusters in
GSE42677 (Fig. 5a). One cluster was highly expressed in normal
skin and became downregulated in AK and SCC, and the other
cluster demonstrated the opposite trend (Fig. 5a). The down- and
upregulated patterns for these genes were largely consistent
between the five data sets (Fig. 5b). Among them, TP53 and
NOTCH2 were downregulated in SCC compared to normal skin,
while seven genes HERC6, CDKN2A, FLNB, MAP3K9, TMEM51,
MAPK1IP1L and WHSC1 were upregulated in SCC relative to

 normal skin in at least 3 out of 5 data sets (Fig. 5b) suggesting
respective potential tumour suppressing and tumour promoting
roles in cSCC development.
Within the amplified regions identified by GISTIC analysis, the
mRNA levels of 23 genes were upregulated in cSCC compared to
normal skin in GSE42677 (Fig. 6a), 38 in Data Set 1, 78 in
GSE32628, 7 in GSE2503 and 43 in GSE84293 (Fig. 6b, top Venn
diagram). Overlap analysis revealed that 19 genes were encoded
in amplified regions and upregulated at the mRNA level in at least
three of these data sets (Fig. 6b, c) indicating that these genes may
play tumour promoting roles in cSCC. Nine genes within deleted
regions identified by GISTIC analysis were also downregulated at
the mRNA level in cSCC compared to normal skin in GSE42677
(Fig. 6a), 11 in Data set 1, 24 in GSE3268,, 2 in GSE2503 and 5 in
GSE84293 (Fig. 6b, bottom Venn diagram). Overlap analysis
revealed that five genes were encoded in deleted regions and
downregulated at the mRNA level in at least three of these data
sets (Fig. 6b, c) indicating that these genes may play tumour
suppressor roles in cSCC.
Identification of WD and MD/PD group-specific SMGs. Dif-
ferentiation status is a prognostic marker in cSCC (reviewed in
ref. 4). We developed a randomisation test strategy to identify
WD and MD/PD group-specific SMGs based on the MutSigCV
and OncodriveFM significance p-values (see Methods, Fig. 7a),
and further selected those group-specific genes that were also
regarded as expressed in the GEP data sets. This led to 16 MD/
PD-specific and 6 WD-specific SMGs, respectively (Fig. 7b). The
MD/PD-specific genes included TMEM51 and GRHL2 previously
identified in the analysis of the whole 40 exomes but also iden-
tified additional MD/PD-specific genes ZZEF1, GMDS, NEDD4L,
LRP1, PRB1, HECTD4, SOS2, ICAM1, VWF, ACVR2A, POLH,
CNDP2, RPLP1 and PRMT3. Their significance has yet to be
described in cSCC although non-silent mutations in some of
these genes have been observed in cSCC10 (Supplementary
Data 23). Interestingly, the expression of ACVR2A appeared to
decline gradually with the disease progression, with the highest
level of expression in the normal skin and the lowest in SCCs in
all five GEP data sets (Supplementary Fig. 11), suggesting its

 potential tumour suppressing role in disease progression. The
WD-specific genes included the previously identified ATP1A1
and additionally SULF1, ZNF528, NRCAM, FAT1 and SEMA5A.
FAT1 has been identified as a significantly mutated putative
driver gene in cSCC6,10 and in normal sun exposed skin6. None of
these other WD-specific genes have been associated with cSCC
although non-silent mutations in some of these genes have been
observed in cSCC10 (Supplementary Data 23).
Mutational pathway analysis. Mutational pathway analysis
revealed several KEGG signalling pathways that were more
mutated in the MD/PD group, such as NOTCH, TGF-β, WNT,
PI3K-AKT and neurotrophin signalling (Fig. 7c and Supple-
mentary Data 24, 25). The MD/PD-specific mutated pathways
also included those related to immune responses such as T-cell
receptor, Fc epsilon RI, RIG-I-like receptor and chemokine sig-
nalling pathways (Fig. 7c). Furthermore, our mutational pathway
analysis revealed that biological processes of ECM-receptor
interaction, cell cycle, tight junction and glycolysis/gluconeo-
genesis were also more significantly mutated in the MD/PD
group compared to WD group, whereas lysine degradation, reg-
ulation of the actin cytoskeleton, carbohydrate digestion and
adsorption and basal transcription factors were among those
specific to the WD group (Fig. 7d and Supplementary Data 25).
Computational pathway analysis of mutated genes in cSCC has
not previously been performed. Manual pathway assessment
previously suggested involvement of the RAS/RTK/PI3K and cell
cycle pathways in aggressive cSCC10 consistent with our obser-
vations (Fig. 7c, d). The findings that PI3K signalling is frequently
altered in more aggressive SCCs such as HNSCC, lung and
oesophageal SCC11 further supports our MD/PD pathway ana-
lysis implicating PI3K-AKT signalling in disease progression.
Patient-derived cell lines reflect primary tumours. To facilitate
future functional studies, tumour keratinocytes were cultured
from multiple tumours and a panel of 15 cell lines was selected
for full characterisation (Supplementary Data 26). Nine were
derived from five OTR patients on immunosuppressive drugs
including five from a single patient (PM1, MET1,2,4, T9)47. Six
lines were derived from five immunocompetent patients (IC1,
IC1MET, IC8, IC12, IC18 and IC19) with IC1/IC1MET being
paired primary and metastatic lymph node derived lines,
respectively.
In general, mutational profiles of patient-derived cell lines were
comparable with those of the tumour sample set (Supplementary
Data 27). Mutation signature analysis showed that signature 7
was present in all cell lines, and eight lines from four patients also
contained signature 32, all of which were derived from tumours
from immunosuppressed patients receiving azathioprine (Fig. 8a
and Supplementary Data 28). Interestingly, PM1, MET1, 2, 4, and
T9 from the same patient show very similar mutation signature
compositions, except that MET4 also exhibited signature 26
associated with defective DNA mismatch repair14 in 32% of its
total mutations (Fig. 8a and Supplementary Data 28). OncoPrint
analysis indicated that many of the cell lines have alterations in
mismatch repair genes (Supplementary Fig. 12) but this does not
correlate with the presence of signature 26. Analysis of somatic
CNA/LOH revealed many recurrently altered regions that were
also present in patient tumours including amplification at 3q26,
7q21 and 11q22, and deletions at 5q13 and 3p12 (Fig. 8b). The
cell lines exhibited a high degree of chromosome instability
similar to the most genomically altered primary tumours.
Mutations in the 22 SMGs from the primary tumour set also
frequently occurred in cell lines, with TP53, NOTCH1/2 and
CDKN2A the most recurrently altered with similar mutational

 profiles in primary tumour samples and cell lines (Fig. 8c,
Supplementary Data 29 and Supplementary Fig. 13).
We also performed gene expression analysis of our cell lines
and three separate isolates of primary normal human keratino-
cytes (NHKs) using Illumina Beadchip arrays (Supplementary
Data 30). NOTCH2, a commonly downregulated SMG in the
primary tumour data set, was also downregulated in cSCC cell
lines in comparison to NHKs (Supplementary Fig. 14A). 2/7
commonly upregulated SMGs (CDKN2A and WHSC1) were also
upregulated in cSCC cell lines compared to NHKs (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 14A). 3/19 commonly amplified and upregulated genes
POLR2H, ALG3 and AP2M1, were also upregulated in the cell
lines relative to NHKs and 2/5 of the commonly deleted and
downregulated genes, SSBP2 and F2R, were also downregulated in
cSCC relative to NHKs (Supplementary Fig. 14B). We further
identified the mutational profiles for MD/PD and WD group-
specific SMGs in cell lines, with MD/PD-specific SMGs ZZEF1,
NEDD4L, LRP1, VWF, HECTD4, ICAM1 and ACVR2A being the
most frequently altered, and WD-specific genes FAT1, NRCAM,
SULF1 and ATP1A1 recurrently altered in SCC lines (Fig. 8d).
Our cell lines thus represent a well characterised resource, which
reflects the molecular landscape of primary cSCC.
Discussion
Here, we present the largest analysis of cSCC WES so far per-
formed and provide a unique data set with 20 samples from
moderately/poorly
differentiated
tumours,
20
from
well-
differentiated tumours and 15 samples from cSCC cell lines.
Thirty-three primary tumour samples and nine cell lines were
derived from immunosuppressed patients. Patients who are
iatrogenically immunosuppressed to prevent organ transplant
rejection have been recognised as being at greatly increased risk of
cSCC (100–250-fold) with a reversal of the normal BCC:cSCC
ratio from 4:1 to 1:22,48.
Each biological process causing mutations in somatic cells that
may drive tumour formation leaves a mutational signature and
deciphering these signatures is a unique opportunity to reveal the
mutational
processes
operative
in
different
cancer
types13,14,16,17,49. We applied this approach to our data set and
found five previously identified signatures in our tumours
including signature 7, which has been associated with exposure to
UVR a known potent skin cancer carcinogen. The UVR signature
was found in 33/37 exomes examined and in all 15 cell lines. A
novel signature, termed signature 32 was found in 27 of the
tumour samples and 8 of the cell lines (Figs. 1, 8). Interrogation of
the clinical history for each patient found that the presence of
signature
32
correlated
with
immunosuppressive
regimens
including use of azathioprine. Although immunosuppressants
such as mycophenolate mofetil, cyclophosphamide and cyclos-
porine A affect DNA damage mechanisms, including UV induced
DNA excision repair50–52, three patients received azathioprine
alone and analysis of treatment times revealed a strong positive
correlation with exposure time to azathioprine and signature 32
prevalence (Supplementary Fig. 3). All of the signature 32 positive
cell lines were also from immunosuppressed patients who
received azathioprine (Fig. 8). Furthermore, only exposure to
azathioprine and not the other immunosuppressive drugs corre-
lated with the presence of signature 32 and the only significant
correlation of immunosuppressive drug use and the presence of
any of the mutational signatures was with azathioprine exposure
and signature 32 (Supplementary Fig. 2). This signature is likely
to be of biological relevance as mutational signature analysis of
mutations in the putative driver genes identified in our study,
revealed that over 65% of these were signature 32 (Fig. 3c).
Azathioprine, an inhibitor of de novo purine synthesis, is asso-
ciated with selective ultraviolet A (UVA) photosensitivity and
mutagenic effects in the skin53. The azathioprine metabolite 6-
thioguanine (6-TG) replaces a small proportion of DNA guanine

 and becomes a strong UVA chromophore, interacting with UVA
to generate reactive oxygen species, which cause widespread DNA
damage and protein oxidation; the latter damages the DNA repair
proteome increasing UVB mutagenicity53,54. Azathioprine pho-
tosensitivity is clinically measurable, may be associated with a
specific genetic signature in basal cell carcinoma55 and can be
reduced by switching from azathioprine to mycophenolate
mofetil (MMF), although azathioprine metabolites may persist in
the skin for several years after withdrawal56. Given the photo-
sensitising properties of azathioprine we postulate that the
combined action of UVR and incorporation of azathioprine
metabolites into DNA provide the biochemical basis for this
novel signature. We propose that these azathioprine effects are
associated with this new genetic signature (signature 32) that
contributes to tumour progression. This has clinical significance
for the many patients currently receiving azathioprine who
should be counselled about their skin cancer risk and UVR
photosensitivity.
We confirm the high mutational burden present in cSCC with
an average of over 1700 mutations present in the primary tumour
exomes (Fig. 1). WES data enabled us to assess clonality and
revealed that most tumours are highly heterogenous containing
2–11 clones (Fig. 4). GISTIC analysis revealed common areas of
copy number loss and gain in our samples with MD/PD tumours
exhibiting higher levels of chromosomal instability compared to
WD tumours (Fig. 2) further illustrating the genetic complexity of
cSCC.
We employed three computational methods (MutSig, Onco-
driveClust, OncodriveFM) and identified 351 SMGs at the cutoffs
we used. Twenty-two genes were found to be significant in two or
more of these programmes enabling a further ranking of the
potential driver genes (Fig. 3). Combination of these analyses
with CNA/LOH analysis indicate that alteration of NOTCH1 and
NOTCH2 genes are among the most common events in cSCC
(Fig. 3) with only 3/20 MD/PD tumours and 5/20 WD tumours
escaping alteration in either of these genes indicating that the

 NOTCH pathway is an almost universal tumour suppressor
pathway in cSCC probably due to its role in promoting cell cycle
exit and differentiation57. We also identify TP53 alterations in
70% of our tumours and CDKN2A changes in nearly 50% of
cases. Clonality analysis revealed that CDKN2A mutations are
clonal (Fig. 4c, d) indicating a likely early event in formation of
the tumours in which they were identified. Strikingly, despite
deep sequencing efforts, CDKN2A mutations in contrast to TP53
or FAT1 mutations have yet to be identified in sun-exposed
‘normal skin’6 suggesting a key gatekeeper role of p16INK4B in
cSCC. Our findings also suggest that mutations in ATP1A1,
HERC6, MAPK1P1L, GRHL2, TRAPPC9, FLNB, NOTCH1 and
MAP3K9 represent early driving events in cSCC (Fig. 4c, d).
Within these, alteration in ATP1A1 may pre-dispose to well-
differentiated tumours, whereas alterations in GRHL2 may pre-
dispose to more poorly differentiated and potentially poorer
prognosis tumours (Fig. 7). GRHL2 mutations are associated with
an autosomal-recessive ectodermal dysplasia58 and this tran-
scription factor may drive a cancer stemness phenotype in oral
SCC59. This gene clearly warrants further investigation in cSCC.
To further sift our list of somatically mutated genes and those
that are encoded within regions of common amplification or loss
we integrated our WES data with five independent gene expres-
sion data sets (Figs. 5, 6). Interestingly, despite the proposed
tumour suppressor role of inactivating mutations in CDKN2A we
consistently observed upregulation of CDKN2A gene expression
in the GEP data sets and in our cell lines (Fig. 5 and Supple-
mentary Fig. 14). Transcription factor motif analysis indicates
that ERK signalling through ETS transcription factors may be
operative during SCC progression7 and this may act to upregulate
CDKN2A expression as part of a stress induced senescence
programme60 possibly explaining this discrepancy. This analysis

 highlights potential oncogenic tumour promoting roles for the
actin binding protein encoded by FLNB and the histone
methyltransferase encoded by WHSC1, as expression of both of
these genes are elevated during cSCC progression and they do not
contain premature termination codon or splice site mutations
(Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. 6, 7). We also identified genetic
alteration of the arginine methyltransferase, PRMT3, specifically
in the MD/PD tumours (Fig. 7B), further indicating that epige-
netic modifiers may regulate cSCC progression. Genes that are
amplified and upregulated during cSCC progression may act as
oncogenic drivers of disease and we revealed 19 further genes
with this potential role including the SKI like proto-oncogene
SnoN encoded by the SKIL gene (Fig. 6). This transcription factor
can modulate canonical TGF-β signalling61 and pathway analysis
revealed that genomic alterations in TGF-β signalling are enri-
ched in the MD/PD group of tumours (Fig. 7C). Consistent with
this we also identify alterations in the ACVR2A gene that encodes
for an activin/BMP receptor enriched in this tumour group,
which is also downregulated during tumour progression (Fig. 7B
and Supplementary Fig. 11) implying a tumour suppressor role
for this gene. Our recent studies have confirmed that the TGF-β
pathway acts as a potent tumour suppressor pathway in cSCC
with mutational inactivation of TGFBR1 and/or TGFBR2 occur-
ring in ~40% of cSCC tumours15.
Integration of gene expression data sets with GISTIC analysis
of CNVs provides a powerful technique for identifying genes,
which contribute to disease progression without the involvement
of SNV alterations. This analysis implicates SEMA3C, STEAP4,
MMP10, RAP2B and AP2M1 as a potential cSCC drivers (Fig. 6).
These genes have been implicated in promoting tumour growth.
SEMA3C can activate RTK signalling and drive prostate cancer
growth62, STEAP4 may promote colorectal cancer develop-
ment63, MMP10 may mediate c-Fos driven cSCC development64,
RAP2B is a well described oncogenic activator65 and AP2M1 may
participate in senescence escape66. These observations support
the hypothesis that our integrated analysis approach has poten-
tially revealed novel drivers of cSCC and provides further impetus
for functional interrogation of the genes and pathways revealed in
our study.
In summary, this study describes the complex molecular
landscape of cSCC and identifies new potential driver genes,
pathways and processes associated with both the development of
well-differentiated and potentially poorer prognosis moderately/
poorly differentiated tumours in both immunosuppressed and
immunocompetent patients. Importantly we identify a novel
mutational signature associated with chronic azathioprine expo-
sure and describe the molecular landscape of 15 cSCC cell lines
derived from both primary and metastatic lesions which reflect
the complexity of tumours and provides a unique resource for
determining the biological significance of the molecular events
responsible for cSCC maintenance and progression.
Methods
Collection of patient samples. The study was approved by the East of Scotland
Research Ethics Service (reference: 08/S1401/69) and the East London and City
Health Authority Local Ethics Committee and conducted according to the
Declaration of Helsinki Principles. All patients participating in the study pro-
vided written, informed consent. Punch biopsies of cSCC were collected in tissue
culture transport medium comprising DMEM supplemented with 50 units/ml
penicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin and 1x fungizone solution (all from Life
Technologies, Paisley, UK) or snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Venous blood
samples were taken from patients into EDTA tubes, aliquoted into cryovials and
stored at −80 °C. Histology of patient samples were reviewed blind by two
independent pathologists. Details of prescribed medications including drug, dose
and duration were derived from two independent reviews of available clinical
notes and transplant databases for all immunosuppressed patients. The esti-
mated time of azathioprine therapy for all patients with a history of azathioprine
use were calculated and rounded to the nearest month. Complete clinical notes
spanning the entire patient journeys were not available for all patients and those
without documentary evidence of azathioprine exposure were classified as no
confirmed exposure.
Isolation and culture of cSCC lines. Cultures were established according to a
previously described method67. In brief, tumour tissue was cut into small pieces
and dissociated by incubation at 37 °C in 0.25% trypsin-EDTA (Life Technologies,
Paisley, UK) followed by physical disruption using needles. Residual tissue was
removed by passing the cell suspension through a 100 μm cell strainer and SCC
keratinocytes recovered by centrifugation and plated onto a mouse 3T3 feeder cell
layer in keratinocyte culture medium comprising DMEM/Ham’s F12 (3:1; Life
Technologies, Paisley, UK) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS;
Biosera, Ringmer, UK) and a cocktail of mitogens67. Cultures were maintained in
keratinocyte culture medium supplemented with 10 ng/ml EGF (Serotec, Oxford,
UK) and passaged upon attaining 80% confluence. All cell lines were routinely
screened for mycoplasma and were negative throughout the study.
DNA extraction and genetic analysis. DNA was extracted from snap-frozen
tissue, cultured cells and blood using the Qiagen DNA Mini kit (Qiagen,
Crawley, UK) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Quantitation was
performed using the double-stranded DNA-specific Qubit dsDNA BR assay kit
in conjunction with the Qubit 2.0 fluorometer (both Life Technologies, Paisley,
UK). Short tandem repeat (STR) genotyping was performed to authenticate the
unique identity of each cell line. Sixteen loci distributed across the human
genome were amplified using the AmpFLSTR Identifiler PCR Amplification Kit
followed by capillary sequencing on the 3730xl DNA analyser (all reagents from
Life Technologies, Paisley, UK). Microarray-based single-nucleotide poly-
morphism (SNP) analysis was performed by subjecting 500 ng DNA from each
cell line and matched blood to the Genome-Wide Human SNP Nsp/Sty 6.0 assay
(Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed by Oxford Gene Technology
(OGT) using Agilent SureSelect All Exon v5 for exome capture. Briefly, 1 μg of
DNA from each sample were used to prepare the sequencing library through
shearing of the DNA followed by ligation of sequencing adaptors. Sequencing
was performed on the Illumina HiSeq platform. Paired-end sequencing (2 × 100
bp) was carried out using HiSeq sequencing instruments.
WES data processing, somatic variant calling and annotation. Thirty previously
published sporadic cSCC samples5,15 were included and reanalysed with our ten
newprimary tumour samples and 15 cSCC cell lines. WES data of all samples
(except the T2 cell line, see below) were analysed using our established
pipeline68,69. The minimum coverage for identified variant sites was required to be
as ten reads. For the cell line sample T2, the variant calling was performed using
the VarScan2 somatic calling module70. There was around 22% of DNA in the
corresponding normal sample that was tumour DNA, suggested by the variant
allele frequency (VAF) density from the normal sample. Within VarScan2 somatic
calling, allele frequencies from the T2 cancer cell line and the normal control
sample were compared by Fisher’s Exact Test, and somatic p-values were derived.
High-confidence somatic calls were subsequently extracted for T2 using the
VarScan2 ‘process-Somatic’ module, with mutations with > 20% VAFs further
selected. Identified somatic variants, including single-nucleotide variants (SNV)
and indels, in 40 patient samples and 12 cell lines were further annotated using
Oncotator71 and SNPnexus72. Mutation signatures across the 40 exomes were
identified based on the non-negative matrix factorisation (NMF) approach
previously described13. WES data of 40 cSCC samples have been deposited
to the European Genome-phenome Archive (EGA) under the accession of
EGAS00001002612.
Identification of mutational driver genes and pathways. We used three methods
to identify different positive selection signals that occurred in driver mutations:
OncodriveFM27, OncodriveCLUST28, both implemented in the IntoGen soft-
ware73, and MutSigCV26. For OncodriveFM and OncodriveCLUST, we used cor-
rected p-values (q < 0.05) for significance. For MutSigCV, due to the small sample
size, p-values could not be adjusted, so raw p < 0.05 was applied. Overlapped genes
that were identified being significant by at least two of the three methods were
further selected. Significantly mutated pathways were also identified using Onco-
driveFM (q < 0.05).
Randomisation test to identify MD/PD and WD-specific drivers. To identify
moderate/poor and well-differentiated specific driver genes, we further applied
OncodriveFM and MutSigCV on 20 moderate/poor and 20 well-differentiated
cSCC samples separately. The significance p-values derived from the two
methods were (-log10) transformed and compared between the two groups to
highlight group-specific genes. In the MutSigCV test, we selected genes with p <
0.01 in one group but p > 0.1 in the other group. In the OncodriveFM test, we
focused on genes with corrected p < 0.05 in one group but corrected p > 0.1 in the
other. For these selected candidate genes, we further developed a randomisation
test procedure where the pool of 40 SCC samples was randomly split into two
groups of equal size (n = 20). We then applied MutSigCV and OncodriveFM on

11
 the two groups and recorded the significance values for our candidate genes. We
repeated this randomisation procedure 100 times and the transformed p-values
from MutSigCV or OncodriveFM generally followed a normal distribution for
each gene. We next calculated the probability that the observed significance in
moderate/poor or well-differentiated group was stronger than that expected by
chance for each candidate. Significant genes from the randomisation test (two-
tail p < 0.05) were further noted and regarded as the true moderate/poor or well-
differentiated specific genes.
Identification of CNA and LOH using WES data. Analyses for CNA and LOH
events from WES data were based on a combinational approach previously
described69,74. We adopted two independent approaches (ASCAT75 and VarScan2/
DNAcopy R packages) to analyse matched tumour and normal samples for copy
number analyses. Using ASCAT, a gain (amplification) is called if (predicted total
copy number – predicted ploidy) > 0.6 and a loss if (predicted total copy number –
predicted ploidy) < −0.6. Using DNAcopy circular binary segmentation (CBS)
segments, the logR ratio was used to discriminate copy number gains and losses
(logR ratio > 0.15 = gain, logR < −0.15 = loss). We then selected only the con-
sensus calls across the two methods. In addition, we visually inspected all CNA/
LOH events using the logR and B-allele frequency (BAF) plots, and further
included copy number gain and loss events when they were clearly supported by
one method, but just below the cutoff threshold in the other. Genes targeted by
copy gain, loss and copy-neutral LOH (cn-LOH) in each sample were further
identified.
Identification of significantly amplified/deleted regions. To further identify
significantly amplified and deleted regions in cSCC genomes, we applied GIS-
TIC2.025 (q < 0.1) using the CNA segments and markers generated by VarScan
variant calling and ASCAT R package75. Thirty-one of the 40 cSCC exomes that
passed the ASCAT analysis were used. Regions that overlap with centromere and
telomere were excluded. We further removed regions that were identified as both
significantly amplified and deleted.
Tumour subpopulation identification and clonality analysis. EXPANDS39 was
used to estimate clonal expansions and cellular frequency of each clonal and
subclonal population. Somatic SNVs, indels and CNA segments derived from
DNAcopy CBS algorithm were used as input for each tumour. Tumour samples
with less than 200 somatic mutations were excluded from this analysis, since
stable results may not be solved for these samples, resulting in processing of 35
out of the 40 WES samples. Within each tumour sample, the largest clone was
identified as the dominant clone and clones with lower cellular frequencies were
regarded as sub-clones. Tumour purity was also estimated based on the cellular
frequency of the dominant clone. All somatic variants were assigned to their
nested clones. We also used SciClone40 to estimate mutational clusters and Infer
clonal architecture for 35/40 cSCC exomes. Similar to EXPANDS, Somatic
SNVs, indels with their VAFs along with CNA segments were used as input. The
cluster with the largest number of mutations was regarded as the dominant clone
for each sample, and subpopulations and tumour purity were subsequently
derived. The clonality results and tumour purity from both methods were fur-
ther compared and assessed.
Gene expression microarray data analysis and integration. Five sets of
expression microarray data of patient samples were selected and downloaded
from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), GSE4267745, GSE4521644, GSE250346,
GSE842937 and GSE3262821. The GSE42677 data set included 10 normal skin, 5
AK, 5 in situ and 5 invasive SCC samples, the GSE2503 data set included 6
normal skin, 4 AK and 5 SCC samples, the GSE84293 data set included 8 normal
skin, 9 AK and 9 SCC samples and the GSE32628 data set included 13 normal
skin, 14 AK and 15 SCC samples. The available normalised expression values in
log2 scale were used. The GSE45216 data set had 10 AK and 30 SCC. For this set,
we further included 16 non-sun-exposed (NSE), 20 sun-exposed (SE) normal
skin and 18 AK samples profiled using the same platform, Affymetrix Human
Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array. All raw.CEL files of 94 samples were assembled
and processed together. Quality control (QC) and normalisation were performed
on our O-miner transcriptomics analysis platform76, where the RMA (robust
multi-array average) approach was used. For all five data sets, differential
expression (DE) analyses between different groups were performed using limma
R package77. The DE genes were identified using the adjusted p-value < 0.05.
For SMGs, as well as significantly amplified and deleted genes identified above,
we further investigated their expression profiles across normal skin, AK and SCC
samples. Based on the normalised non-log2 transformed expression values, we
regarded probes with the expression values <100 as not being expressed or
expressed at a low level. Thus, we further identified genes that were expressed
across normal skin, AK and SCC samples in the five data sets. We then categorised
them as genes with an activating role in the tumour development if they were
significantly upregulated, or genes with a suppressing role if they were significantly
downregulated in SCC/AK samples compared to normal skin, in at least three out
of the five data sets.
For patient-derived cell lines, gene expression data were obtained from Illumina
HumanHT-12 v4 Expression BeadChip. Raw image files were first processed using
Illumina GenomeStudio, and then normalised using the O-miner platform where
lumi R bioconductor package78 was applied. The limma R package was used for the
DE analysis. The raw and normalised data have been deposited at GEO under the
accession number of GSE98780.
