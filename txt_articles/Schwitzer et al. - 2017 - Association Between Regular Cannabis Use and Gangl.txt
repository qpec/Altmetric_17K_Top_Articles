IMPORTANCE Because cannabis use is a major public health concern and cannabis is known to
act on central neurotransmission, studying the retinal ganglion cells in individuals who
regularly use cannabis is of interest.
OBJECTIVE To determine whether the regular use of cannabis could alter the function of
retinal ganglion cells in humans.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS For this case-control study, individuals who regularly
use cannabis, as well as healthy controls, were recruited, and data were collected from
February 11 to October 28, 2014. Retinal function was used as a direct marker of brain
neurotransmission abnormalities in complex mental phenomena.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Amplitude and implicit time of the N95 wave on results of
pattern electroretinography.
RESULTS Twenty-eight of the 52 participants were regular cannabis users (24 men and 4
women; median age, 22 years [95% CI, 21-24 years]), and the remaining 24 were controls
(20 men and 4 women; median age, 24 years [95% CI, 23-27 years]). There was no difference
between groups in terms of age (P = .13) or sex (P = .81). After adjustment for the number of
years of education and alcohol use, there was a significant increase for cannabis users of the
N95 implicit time on results of pattern electroretinography (median, 98.6 milliseconds
[95% CI, 93.4-99.5]) compared with controls (median, 88.4 milliseconds [95% CI, 85.0-91.1]),
with 8.4 milliseconds as the median of the differences (95% CI, 4.9-11.5; P < .001, Wald
logistic regression). A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis (area under the curve,
0.84 [95% CI, 0.73-0.95]; P < .001) revealed, for a cutoff value of 91.13 milliseconds, a
sensitivity of 78.6% (95% CI, 60.5%-89.8%) and a specificity of 75.0% (95% CI,
55.1%-88.0%) for correctly classifying both cannabis users and controls in their
corresponding group. The positive predictive value was 78.6% (95% CI, 60.5%-89.8%), and
the negative predictive value was 75.0% (95% CI, 55.1%-88.0%).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Our results demonstrate a delay in transmission of action
potentials by the ganglion cells in regular cannabis users, which could support alterations in
vision. Our findings may be important from a public health perspective since they could
highlight the neurotoxic effects of cannabis use on the central nervous system as a result of
how it affects retinal processing.

tal extension of the central nervous system,1 which sev-

for investigating human central synaptic transmission in com-
plex mental phenomena.2-12 Among these phenomena, the in-
creasing use of cannabis represents an ever-growing public
health challenge,13 but little is known about the effect of can-
nabis use on human neural synaptic transmission. Retinal pro-
cessing could constitute a breakthrough on this issue.
This study aimed to assess the stage of the retinal gan-
glion cells (RGCs) because it is particularly relevant to study
the effect of regular cannabis use on human neural synaptic
transmission. Retinal ganglion cells are the last and most inte-
grated stage of retinal processing and the first retinal stage
providing visual information in the form of action potentials,
such as is found in the brain.14 The endocannabinoid system
is detected in RGCs and is involved in RGC synaptic trans-
mission.3,5,15 For example, in animals, cannabinoid agonists
reduce glutamate release in rodent RGCs.16,17 In humans, glu-
tamate is also a main transmitter involved in retinal physi-
ologic structure and in the vertical transmission of retinal
information.18,19 The action of cannabis on central glutama-
tergic transmission20 may thus disturb RGC function in
humans. To verify this hypothesis, we used a standard elec-
trophysiological measurement called pattern electroretinog-
raphy (PERG),21 which involved averaging a high number of
responses, thereby ensuring reproducibility of the results.22
With PERG, the best marker of RGC function is a negative
wave—the N95 wave—2 parameters of which are usually
known as the amplitude and the implicit time, which denotes
the time needed to reach the maximal amplitude of N95.21,22
We describe the results of the first study, to our knowl-
edge,toassesstheeffectofregularcannabisuseonhumanRGC
function. Given the role of the cannabinoid system in regu-
lating RGC synaptic transmission, we hypothesized that the
RGC response can be affected by regular cannabis use.
Methods
Study Population
Twenty-eight individuals who regularly used cannabis and
24 matched, healthy, drug-naive controls were recruited
among the general population via a special press campaign,
and data were collected from February 11 to October 28,
2014. Before taking part in the study, volunteers provided
their detailed psychoactive drug and medical history, under-
went a full psychiatric evaluation, and signed consent forms
detailing all aspects of the research. All participants received
payment in the form of €100 (approximately US $110) in gift
vouchers. The study protocol met the requirements of the
Declaration of Helsinki23 and was approved by the Nancy
University Hospital Ethics Committee. This study is part of a
larger project, Causa Map, which is researching the effect of
regular cannabis use on the visual system. All participants
also underwent neuropsychological assessments and electro-
encephalography while they performed several visual tasks.
Given the innovative nature of these measurements, the pro-
tocol provides an intermediate analysis that is focused on
RGC functioning.
The inclusion criteria for the cannabis group were regular
cannabis use at the rate of at least 7 cannabis consumptions
per week during the past month, positive results for tetrahy-
drocannabinol metabolites on a urine toxicology test, no
other illicit substance use in the past month, negative results
for other illicit substances on a urine toxicology test, and no
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth
Edition) diagnosis of Axis I disorders. Since tobacco is regu-
larly mixed with cannabis in cigarettes (joints), cannabis
users may meet the criteria for tobacco dependence accord-
ing to the Fagerström test. Cannabis users were required to
present with at least 12 hours of abstinence of cannabis use
so that there were no acute cognitive dysfunctions owing to
cannabis use.
Inclusion criteria for the healthy controls were no history
of illicit substance use, negative results for tetrahydrocannabi-
nolmetabolitesandotherillicitdrugsonaurinetoxicologytest,
and no history of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders (Fourth Edition) diagnosis of Axis I psychiatric dis-
orders. All participants were aged 18 to 35 years, had no his-
tory of neurologic disease, no family history of schizophrenia
or bipolar disorders, and were not taking medication except
for oral contraceptives in the case of women. They had no his-
tory of ophthalmologic disease except for corrected refrac-
tive errors. All participants had normal results on ophthalmic
evaluation,whichincludedvisualacuityandafundoscopicex-
amination. More important, visual acuity measured with the
Monoyer Scale was at least 10/10 in each eye for all partici-
pants. None of the participants reported visual symptoms, and
none was found to have any media opacities. If participants
reported alcohol dependence according to their score in the
Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), they were
excluded from the study.
Clinical and Biological Assessments
The Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview was ad-
ministered to assess current and past history of psychiatric dis-
eases and substance use. In addition, the Cannabis Abuse
Screening Test, Fagerström Test, and AUDIT were performed
to assess use, abuse, or dependence with respect to cannabis,
tobacco, and alcohol, respectively. The extent of cannabis use
Key Points
Question What is the effect of regular cannabis use on the
function of retinal ganglion cells?
Findings In this case-control study of 28 individuals who regularly
used cannabis and 24 controls, a large delay in retinal information
processing was found in regular cannabis users compared with
controls based on an increase in N95 implicit time on results of
pattern electroretinography.
Meaning Although this study is preliminary and not designed to
determine cause and effect, the findings suggest that retinal
function might be used as a marker of brain neurotransmission
abnormalities in cannabis users.

was clinically assessed in an interview and a questionnaire as
follows: age when regular cannabis use began, total years of
cannabis use, average number of joints smoked daily and
weekly during the past month, and average number of grams
of cannabis smoked weekly (Table). To obtain objective con-
firmation of cannabis consumption, urine drug tests (nal von
minden) were performed for cannabis, buprenorphine, ben-
zodiazepines, cocaine, opiates, amphetamines, and metha-
done immediately before PERG testing.
PERG Measurements
Pattern electroretinography measurements were compiled ac-
cording to the International Society for Clinical Electrophysi-
ology of Vision standards for PERG.21 The MonPackOne sys-
tem (Metrovision) was used for stimulation, recording, and
analysis. Electrical signals were recorded simultaneously from
both eyes (averaged for analysis) on nondilated pupils, with
Dawson-Trick-Litzkow electrodes (Metrovision) placed at the
bottom of the conjunctival sac. Ground and reference elec-
trodes were attached to the participant’
s forehead and exter-
nal canthi. A black-and-white reversible checkerboard was
used, with 0.8° check size, 93.3% contrast level, 100 can-
dela/m2constantluminancewhitearea,and4reversalspersec-
ond. The participant was positioned 1 m from the screen. In
the case of participants with refractive disorders, an appro-
priate optic correction was provided. At least 220 responses
were recorded for each participant, with constant ambient
room lighting to achieve the best signal to noise ratio. Pattern
electroretinography data were analyzed with Moniteur Oph-
thalmique (Metrovision). Pattern electroretinography analy-
sis was performed with the experimenter masked to the sta-
tus of the participant being recorded (ie, cannabis user or
control).Twomaincomponentsareusuallydescribedonatypi-
cal PERG trace: an electropositive component, P50, followed
by an electronegative component, N95. The electronegative
component (N95) is attributed to the RGC and reflects their
response.21TwomainparametersarederivedfromN95,known
by convention as the amplitude measured in microvolts and
the implicit time measured in milliseconds. The N95 ampli-
tude is measured from the trough of the N95 wave to the peak
of the P50 wave. Implicit time denotes the time taken to reach
the maximum N95 amplitude.
Statistical Analysis
Depending on the nonparametric distribution of several vari-
ables included in the analyses, the Mann-Whitney test, χ2 test,
and Spearman rank correlation test were used when appro-
priate to compare the 2 groups or to test the association be-
tween variables. Among all the variables and in this particu-
lar context, the relevant differences between the 2 groups
involved N95 implicit time, years of education, AUDIT score,
and average number of alcohol uses per week. To analyze N95
implicit time between the two groups, we used logistic regres-
sion to adjust for years of education and alcohol use. As aver-
age alcohol use per week was correlated with the AUDIT score,
we kept the AUDIT score in the analysis. The logistic regres-
sion included N95 implicit time, years of education, and the
AUDITscore,withcannabisusersandcontrolsasthebinaryout-

plied to the N95 implicit time values to estimate the sensitiv-
ity and specificity of cutoff values between regular cannabis
users and controls. Since this study is a pilot study based on
preliminary data, we chose to use a conservative level of sig-
nificance in comparison with α<.025. Statistical analyses were
performed using IBM SPSS Statistics, version 22.0 (IBM Corp).
Results
Demographic and Substance Use Characteristics
The demographic and substance use characteristics of the
participants are described in the Table. There was no signifi-
cant difference between controls and cannabis users for
median age (cannabis users, 22 years [95% CI, 21-24]; con-
trols, 24 years [95% CI, 23-27]; P = .13) or sex (cannabis users,
24 men [86%] and 4 women [14%]; controls, 20 men [83%]
and 4 women [17%]; P = .81), but differences were noted
between the groups in terms of average years of education
(cannabis users, 13.5 years [95% CI, 13-14]; controls, 15 years
[95% CI, 14-16]; P = .02), average number of alcohol uses per
week (cannabis users, 4 [95% CI, 3-6]; controls, 1 [95% CI,
0-2]; P = .002), and median AUDIT score (cannabis users, 6
[95% CI, 4-10]; controls, 3 [95% CI, 1-4]; P < .001). Because
tobacco is widely mixed with cannabis in joints, 21 of 28 can-
nabis users were also tobacco smokers, whereas all members
of the control group were nonsmokers. More important, can-
nabis users were not dependent on tobacco, apart from 1 indi-
vidual who was only mildly dependent.
PERG Parameters
We found an increase in N95 implicit time on the results of
PERG in the 28 regular cannabis users (median, 98.6 millisec-
onds [95% CI, 93.4-99.5]) compared with the 24 healthy con-
trols (median, 88.4 milliseconds [95% CI, 85.0-91.1]), with 8.4

milliseconds as the median of the differences (95% CI, 4.9-
11.5; P < .001, Wald logistic regression) (Figure 1). The me-
dian N95 amplitude was –3.90 μV (95% CI, –4.55 to –3.60) in
cannabis users vs –3.78 μV (95% CI, –4.45 to –3.15) in controls
(P = .37, Mann-Whitney test) (Figure 2).
The logistic regression was conducted with N95 implicit
time, years of education, and the AUDIT score, with cannabis
users and controls as the binary outcome variable. As average
number of alcohol uses per week was correlated with the AU-
DITscore(Spearmanrankcorrelation,0.736;P < .001),wekept
the AUDIT score (P < .001 for the difference between controls
and cannabis users vs P = .002 for the average number of al-
cohol uses per week) in this analysis. The results of the logis-
ticregression(χ2 = 40.3;P < .001;HosmerLemeshowχ2 = 6.21;
P = .62; 86.5% of participants correctly classified in their re-
spective group: 89% of cannabis users and 83% of controls)
showed that N95 implicit time was significant (Wald P = .001),
as was the AUDIT score (Wald P = .008), but years of educa-
tion was not significant (Wald P = .10).
The N95 implicit time and AUDIT score were both signifi-
cant between cannabis users and controls. The product AU-
DIT score × N95 implicit time (interaction) was not added to
the model because it was too strongly correlated with the AU-
DITscore(Spearmanrankcorrelation,0.994;P < .001).Wethus
graphically investigated the interaction with 2 regression lines
of N95 implicit time on the AUDIT score for controls and can-
nabis users (Figure 3). The 95% CI of the 2 slopes, which were
both negative, overlapped, and the lines did not cross among
the ranges of the observed values (controls, 0.299; [95% CI,
–1.111 to 0.516]; cannabis users, –0.517; [95% CI, –1.114 to
0.078]).
Spearman rank correlations among all 52 participants be-
tween N95 implicit time and years of education, AUDIT score,
and average number of alcohol uses per week were, respec-
tively, –0.149 (P = .29), 0.093 (P = .51), and 0.125 (P = .38).
Spearman rank correlations for the 28 cannabis users be-
tween N95 implicit time and number of cigarettes per day and
numberofpacketsoftobaccoperyearwere,respectively,–0.191
(P = .33) and –0.165 (P = .40).
Sensitivity and Specificity
A receiver operating characteristic curve was used to assess
the best N95 implicit time cutoff value capable of discrimi-
nating between cannabis users and controls (area under the
curve, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.73-0.95; P < .001). Results indicated
that the cutoff value giving the best balance between sensi-
tivity and specificity for regular cannabis users and controls
was 91.13 milliseconds. Twenty-two of 28 regular cannabis
users were above the cutoff, with an estimated sensitivity of
78.6% (95% CI, 60.5%-89.8%), whereas 18 of 24 controls
were below the cutoff, with an estimated specificity of 75.0%

Discussion
Our results indicate that regular cannabis users appear to dis-
play an increase in N95 implicit time on PERG results with no
modification in N95 amplitude. Typical PERG traces are pre-
sented in the eFigure in the Supplement. This finding pro-
vides evidence for a delay of approximately 10 milliseconds
in the transmission of action potentials evoked by the RGCs.
As this signal is transmitted along the visual pathway via the
optic nerve and lateral geniculate nucleus to the visual cor-
tex, this anomaly might account for altered vision in regular
cannabis users.
Although this anomaly found in regular cannabis users
was not associated with visual symptoms, we think it may
underlie several deficits in information processing. The
effects of regular cannabis use on the main cognitive func-
tions, such as memory, attention, executive function, psy-
chomotor function, and decision making, have been the sub-
ject of many studies.24 For example, regular cannabis use
reduces the speed of information processing, leading to
attentional disorders, and can cause psychomotor retarda-
tion. Retinal processing also seems to be slowed in regular
cannabis users, although, paradoxically, regular users tend to
respond very quickly and impulsively during several tasks to
assess risk-taking and impulsivity. This alteration detected in
retinal function could be an early marker of cognitive deterio-
ration affecting high-level cognitive functions in regular can-
nabis users.
Limitations
This study has several limitations. First, it is a pilot study in-
volving a small number of participants. Consequently, PERG
measurements would need to be replicated in a larger popu-
lation. Second, because cannabis is widely used in conjunc-
tion with tobacco, particularly mixed together in joints, it is
difficult to distinguish the effect of each compound. To our
knowledge, the effect of chronic administration of nicotine on
PERG results has not yet been investigated. A control group
of tobacco smokers could be useful for differentiating be-
tween cannabis- and tobacco-associated effects. Third, al-
though we found a delay in the response of the RGCs, we do
notknowifthisdelayisalsodetectedatpreviousretinalstages.
Full-field electroretinography measurements might be use-
ful for addressing this issue. Similarly, another PERG compo-
nent, namely P50, is of particular interest for studying macu-
lar function. We would need to assess parameters extracted
from this wave—amplitude and implicit time—and its mor-
phologic features to find out more about the effect of canna-
bis use on retinal functioning. Finally, in future studies involv-
ing PERG measurements, it would be important to have visual
acuity of at least 20/20 in each eye. All these limitations could
be addressed in the future.
Here, we assume that cannabis affected the RGC re-
sponse because our results are still significant when alcohol
use is integrated in statistical analysis. Although alcohol and
cannabis have an opposite action on glutamatergic signaling
pathways,20,25 it cannot be ruled out that an interaction be-
tween them had an effect on the RGC response. This possibil-
ity should be explored in further studies including, for ex-
ample, a control group of alcohol users. Cannabis users in our
study share the same pattern as in other studies; namely, they
are also alcohol users and have a lower educational level.26,27
Finally, it would be premature to interpret the sensitivity and
specificity of the findings given that our study is a pilot study
involving a small number of participants.
Such alterations are found in other pathologic condi-
tions, such as various optic neuropathic disorders, and can re-
veal axonal injuries or apoptosis of RGCs, which are com-
monly detected with tests such as PERG.28 The fact that an
increase in N95 implicit time was found with no modification
in N95 amplitude suggests that the total number of cells in-
volved in the RGC response was unchanged but argues in fa-
vor of a loss of their functional properties.29 Accordingly, in
some cases, such as optic demyelinating neuropathic condi-
tions, modifications in the N95 wave, coupled or not with al-
terations in the P50 wave—the first positive PERG wave rep-
resenting the macular function22—can discriminate between
the acute or chronic state of the disease and may be of prog-
nostic value.29 Consequently, the P50 wave should be the sub-
ject of future study.
We suggest that these anomalies may be linked to dys-
functions in retinal glutamatergic transmission given that the

effects of cannabis on glutamatergic transmission have
already been demonstrated in the central nervous system.5,20
In addition, in the vertebrate retina, glutamate is one of the
main neurotransmitters involved in the vertical transmission
of retinal information18,19 and is released by the RGCs.30 We
hypothesize that, as a result of exocannabinoids, such as tet-
rahydrocannabinol acting on retinal endocannabinoids, regu-
lar cannabis use may modulate the retinal level of glutamate,
thus altering the retinal signal elicited by the RGCs. However,
other neurotransmitter-signaling pathways expressed in the
retina, such as dopaminergic and gamma-aminobutyric acid–
ergic, could be targeted by exocannabinoids. Thus, other reti-
nal electrophysiologic measurements, such as full-field elec-
troretinography and multifocal electroretinography, could
yield critical information about the effect of regular cannabis
use on retinal functioning. The precise mechanisms underly-
ing these anomalies on PERG results need to be investigated
with a view to understanding the biological underpinning of
retinal functional anomalies found in cannabis users.
Conclusions
To our knowledge, this is the first study to show RGC dysfunc-
tions in regular cannabis users. Such results are particularly
relevant for exploring the cerebral effect of cannabis on syn-
aptic transmission since retinal processing is easily measur-
able and not affected by high-level cognitive functions. As-
sessments of retinal function could therefore provide valid,
reliable,andreproduciblemeasurementsthatcouldreflectcan-
nabis-associated brain dysfunctions. Cannabis use is wide-
spread worldwide and, consequently, the subject of great in-
terest in terms of public health prospects. Independent of
debates about its legalization, it is necessary to gain more
knowledge about the different effects of cannabis so that the
public can be informed. Future studies may shed light on the
potential consequences of these retinal dysfunctions for vi-
sual cortical processing and whether these dysfunctions are
permanent or disappear after cannabis withdrawal.

Invited Commentary
Retinal Ganglion Cell Dysfunction in Regular Cannabis Users
Is the Evidence Strong Enough to Consider an Association?
Christopher J. Lyons, MD, FRCSC; Anthony G. Robson, PhD
Cannabis is widely used, and over the last decade, this drug
has been legalized in several jurisdictions. Many others are
considering this change. While public information and road
safety campaigns have con-
sistently focused on alcohol,
cannabis-related toxicity has
been relatively neglected as a public health issue. Further,
rigorous investigation of this drug is therefore timely and
appropriate.
We read with interest the study by Schwitzer et al1 in which
the pattern electroretinogram (PERG) was used as a measure of
retinalganglioncellfunction.Theyconcludethatregularuseof
cannabisisassociatedwithadelayinthePERGN95component
and infer this represents delayed transmission of action poten-
tials from the retina to the visual cortex. However, shortcom-
ings in the study design, methods, and data analysis, acknowl-
edged in part by the authors, weaken their conclusions.
The authors identified a study group of “regular cannabis
users.”1 Perhaps because this drug is illegal, the amount and
purity of drug consumed by each participant could not be de-
termined. Dose delivery via inhalation is notoriously vari-
able, depending on smoking dynamics.2 Urine screens were
used as proof of tetrahydrocannabinol consumption and ab-
sence of other unspecified illicit substances, but more direct
measures, such as blood concentrations, were not obtained.
The authors recognized but did not consider in their analyses
the possible confounding influence of tobacco,1 shown by
others3 to influence electrophysiological parameters, includ-
ing the PERG, multifocal ERG, and cortical pattern visual
evoked potential. Other than alcohol, the long-term expo-
sure to other drugs, diet, and lifestyle are other variables with
potential effects on retinal electrophysiology.
It is not clear why the analysis is limited to the PERG N95
component. N95 and approximately 70% of the P50 compo-
nent arise in the retinal ganglion cells, but some of P50 is gen-
erated by more anterior or distal retinal structures.4-6 Pattern
ERG P50 reduction or delay usually reflects macular cone or
macular cone bipolar dysfunction with concomitant altera-
tion of N95, generated downstream from P50.5 This can oc-
cur in the absence of visible fundus change. Pattern ERG P50
reduction may also result from severe retinal ganglion cell dys-
function, but often in association with shortening of P50 peak
time. Pattern ERG P50 is also attenuated by optical factors and
poor fixation. The authors acknowledge the importance of P50
assessment but do not quantify or characterize this
component.1 Pattern ERG P50 timing and amplitude may have
influence on N95 parameters, and omission from this study
substantially weakens the strength of the evidence of the po-
tential association of regular cannabis use and retinal gan-
glion cell dysfunction.
The authors consider that averaging a large number of
PERG responses ensured the reproducibility of the results.1
While this may improve the signal-to-noise ratio of a single
recording (providing participants did not become fatigued
and less able to fixate and focus on the pattern stimulus), it
does not demonstrate reproducibility, usually considered
