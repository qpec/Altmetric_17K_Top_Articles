Context: Estrogen has been implicated in the development of uterine fibroids. However, the
contribution of androgen in women is unknown.
Objective: Our objective was to assess the longitudinal relations of circulating androgens and
estradiol (E2) and their joint effects to the risk of developing fibroids.
Design: This is a 13-year longitudinal study in the Study of Women’s Health Across the Nation.
Setting: This study was conducted in seven sites across the United States (1997–2013).
Participants: At baseline, 3240 pre- or early peri-menopausal women with an intact uterus, ages
45–52 years were included; 43.6% completed the follow-up. There were 512 incident and 478
recurrent fibroid cases.
Exposures: We measured near-annual time-varying serum levels of bioavailable E2 and bioavail-
able T, dichotomized at the median (high vs low).
Main Outcomes and Measures: We estimated the conditional odds ratio (OR) of fibroids in the
ensuing year using discrete-time proportional odds models adjusted for race/ethnicity/site, age,
body mass index, menopausal stage, reproductive factors, smoking, timing of blood draw, and FSH.
Results: Women with high T had a statistically significant increased risk of incident fibroids (OR,
1.33; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01–1.76; P � .04), but not recurrent fibroids. This risk was
further elevated in those with high T and E2 (OR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.07–2.17; P � .02). High E2 and T
was associated with lower risk of recurrent fibroids (OR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.26–0.96; P � .04).
Conclusions: High T with high E2 was associated with an elevated risk of incident fibroids in midlife
women who never reported fibroids before baseline. Conversely, the risk of recurrent fibroids was
mitigated in women with high E2 and high T. (J Clin Endocrinol Metab 101: 123–130, 2016)
U
terine fibroids (leiomyomata) are benign neoplasms
that develop from the myometrium of the uterus (1).
Usually emerging during pre- or peri-menopause, fibroids
are detected in 70–80% of women by age 50 years (2).
Fibroids can cause irregular uterine bleeding, pelvic pain,
infertility, recurrent pregnancy loss, and other reproduc-
tive complications (1). An estimated annual medical ex-
penditure of $34.4 billion is attributed to the management
of fibroids in the United States (3). Hysterectomy remains
the first-line treatment for fibroids, with few alternative

 long-term medical treatment options (2). Myomectomy
can be performed to remove individual detected fibroids;
however, recurrence from underlying risk factors is still
possible (4).
The strongest established risk factors for fibroids in-
clude being African-American, adiposity, and exogenous
estrogen exposure (5–8). Estrogen-containing contracep-
tives or menopausal hormone therapy have also been as-
sociated with an increased risk of fibroids (9, 10). Further,
menstruating women were found to have a higher risk of
fibroids compared to postmenopausal women, most likely
because of higher estrogen levels (11, 12) The bioactive
form of estrogen (17�-estradiol [E2]) promotes the pro-
liferation of fibroids via up-regulation of progesterone re-
ceptor expression (13). In vitro studies have also impli-
cated androgen in the development of uterine fibroids (2,
14). Aromatase, which catalyzes androgen to estrogen, is
overexpressed in fibroid tissue compared to normal myo-
metrium, thus underscoring the potential relationship be-
tween androgen and estrogen in fibroid development (2,
15, 16). However, the role of circulating androgen and E2,
and their interplay, in relation to the risk of fibroids is un-
known. Characterizing these roles could better elucidate the
pathogenesis of fibroids and aid in developing preventive
strategies and nonsurgical treatment alternatives.
Toaddressthegapsinknowledge,weleverageddatafrom
the prospective Study of Women’s Health Across the Nation
(SWAN). The primary hypothesis was that higher bioavail-
able levels of E2 and androgens (T, and dehydroepiandros-
terone-sulfate[DHEAS])wouldbeassociatedwithincreased
riskofdevelopinguterinefibroids.Thestudyobjectiveswere
to determine: 1) the individual relationships and joint effects
oftime-varyingcirculatinglevelsofbioavailableE2,bioavail-
able T, and DHEAS, to the risks of developing incident fi-
broids and first recurrence of fibroids across a 13-year fol-
low-upperiodinmidlifewomenundergoingthemenopausal
transition (MT); and 2) if these relationships differed among
women in different racial/ethnic groups.
Materials and Methods
Study population
SWAN is a seven-site, longitudinal, community-based, mul-
tiethnic cohort study of midlife women undergoing the MT.
SWAN enrolled 3302 eligible women at baseline and is currently
conducting its 15th follow-up visit (17). Eligible women at base-
line had to be 42–52 years old, pre- or early peri-menopausal,
had a menstrual period and no exogenous hormone use in the
prior 3 months, had an intact uterus and at least one ovary, and
not be pregnant or lactating. Since 1996, SWAN participants
were evaluated at near-annual, in-person visits using self-admin-
istered questionnaires and interviews to obtain information on
demographics, medical history, reproductive characteristics, an-
thropometric measures, and medication use. Additionally,
whole blood samples were collected and assays for serum bio-
markers were performed. The institutional review boards of all
participating institutions approved the SWAN core study. All
participating women provided written informed consent.
The current study used a longitudinal design and excluded
womenwhoreportedhavinghysterectomyorcancerdiagnosisat
baseline. Approximately 70–80% of women in the general pop-
ulation develop fibroids before age 50 years. Because the age range
at baseline was 45–52 years, women who self-reported medical
diagnosis of fibroids before baseline, but had an intact uterus, were
also analyzed to enhance generalizability. Therefore, development
of incident and first recurrent fibroids were of interest separately
and together. The study sample consisted of 3240 women at base-
line.Throughoutthe13-yearfollow-up,womenwhoreportedhav-
ing incident or recurrent fibroids, hysterectomy, died, or were per-
manently lost to follow-up since the last visit were censored at the
time of initial report from future risk sets.
Outcome assessment: uterine fibroids
Uterine fibroids were self-reported on near-annual question-
naires throughout the follow-up. Fibroid occurrence was ascer-
tained by asking the question, “Since your last study visit, has a
doctor, nurse practitioner or other health care provider told you
that you had fibroids, benign growths of the uterus or womb, or
treated you for them,” from baseline to visit 3. From visits 4
through 13, fibroid occurrence was ascertained by asking “Since
your last study visit, have you had fibroids?”
Exposure assessment: serum levels of sex
hormones
SWAN measured serum total E2, total T, DHEAS, FSH, and
SHBG levels in near-annual intervals throughout the follow-up
(18). For pre- and early peri-menopausal women, timing of
blood draw was defined as “in window” if between days 2 and
5 of menstrual cycle and “out of window” otherwise. Endocrine
assays were performed with an Automated Chemiluminescence
System (ACS)-180 analyzer (Bayer Diagnostics Corporation) us-
ing a double-antibody chemiluminescent immunoassay with a
solid phase anti-IgG immunoglobulin conjugated to paramag-
netic particles, anti-ligand antibody, and competitive ligand la-
beled with dimethyl acridinium ester, as previously described
(18). Total E2 was assessed with a modified the rabbit anti-E2-6
ACS-180 immunoassay to increase sensitivity and had a lower
limit of detection of 1.0 pg/ml. Total T was measured using a
modified rabbit polyclonal anti-T ACS-180 immunoassay. The
DHEAS and SHBG assays were developed on-site using rabbit
anti-DHEAS and anti-SHBG antibodies. Duplicate E2 assays
were performed and arithmetic means were reported for each
participant, with a coefficient of variation of 3–12%. All other
assays were single measurements. Bioavailable E2 and T levels
were unitless indices representing the bioactive forms unbound
to SHBG. Bioavailable E2 was calculated as the ratio of total E2
to SHBG: 100 � (total E2 [pg/ml] � [0.003671 nM per 1 pg/ml
E2])/SHBG nM). Bioavailable T was calculated as the ratio of
total T to SHBG: 100 � (total T [ng/dl] � [0.0347 nM per 1 ng/dl
T]/SHBG nM) (17, 19).
Covariates
The following covariates were chosen based on previous lit-
erature: age at baseline, race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, Af-

 rican-American, Japanese, Chinese, and Hispanic), study site,
time-varying MT stage (post- and late peri-menopause vs pre-
and early peri-menopause), time-varying body mass index (BMI)
(continuous; log kg/m2), time-varying sex hormone use for any
reason including oral contraception, time-varying progestin use,
time-varying current and former smoking status (binary) (20),
time-varying passive smoke exposure (0, 1–4, �5 person-hours/
week) (21), time-varying FSH (mIU/ml), parity at baseline, age at
first birth, and timing of blood draw (in vs out of window) to
account for short-term fluctuations in hormone levels during the
menstrual cycle, while recognizing the irregularity of menstrual
cycles during the MT.
Data analyses
At baseline, the distribution and normality of continuous
variables were assessed using histograms, QQ plots, and Sha-
piro-Wilks tests. Differences in normally distributed continuous
variables between racial/ethnic groups were assessed using
ANOVA. Differences in non-normally distributed variables be-
tween racial/ethnic groups were assessed using Kruskal-Wallis
tests. Continuous variables with right-skewed distributions were
natural-log transformed to approximate normal distributions.
Differences in categorical variables between racial/ethnic groups
were assessed using �2 tests. Spearman correlation coefficient
matrices were used to assess the monotonic associations among
independent variables.

Median values were from women who did not reported fibroids
prior to baseline. A “combination” variable for bioavailable T and
E2 was created with four categories: high T and high E2, high T and
low E2, low T and high E2, and low T and low E2 (the reference
category). The combination variable was used to evaluate the joint
effectofbioavailableE2andT.Similarly,acombinationvariablefor
DHEAS and bioavailable E2 was assessed.
Unadjusted and multivariable-adjusted discrete-time propor-
tional odds models were used to estimate the conditional odds
ratio (OR) of developing uterine fibroids in the ensuing year, in
relation to time-varying levels of circulating sex hormones. The
time scale was follow-up time in near-annual intervals (study
visits). The follow-up time was from baseline to the 13th fol-
low-up visit. Discrete-time survival models were used because
the data were only observed in equally spaced discrete intervals
(22).Discrete-timewasspecifiedinthemodelstoaccountfortied
event outcomes within intervals. The multivariable-adjusted
models controlled for race/ethnicity, study site, and menopausal
stage by stratification of the timescale, assuming different inter-
cepts. The other previously mentioned covariates were paramet-
rically adjusted. Three separate analyses were performed to es-
timate the risk of: 1) developing either incident or first recurrence
of fibroids, in women with or without reported fibroids prior to
baseline; 2) incident fibroids in women without reported fibroids
at baseline; and 3) first recurrence of fibroids in women who
reported fibroids prior to baseline.
Separate modeling was performed for: 1) “high” vs “low”
levels of bioavailable E2, bioavailable T, and DHEAS, as dichot-
omized independent variables in the same model; and 2) each of
the combination variables. Time-varying serum sex hormones
were lagged by one follow-up visit in both the unadjusted and
multivariable-adjusted analyses. Time-varying covariates were
lagged by one visit in the multivariable-adjusted analyses. Each
covariate was evaluated for its association with incident fibroids
in separate unadjusted models. Interaction terms between bio-
availableE2andeachandrogen(bioavailableTandDHEAS)and
between each sex hormone and race/ethnicity were included in
some of the multivariable-adjusted models to assess effect measure
modification. Interaction terms involving the combination sex hor-
mone variables were not fitted in the analyses due to implied re-
dundancy. Proportionality assumptions were assessed using inter-
action terms between the independent variables and time.
No blood draws occurred at the 11th follow-up visit. Women
from the Newark, NJ, study site were censored after the sixth
follow-up visit due to administrative issues resulting in discon-
tinuation of data collection. Missing time-varying data through-
out the follow-up period were imputed using last observation
carried forward from the previous visit. All analyses were per-
formed using SAS v9.4 (SAS Institute Inc). P values �.05 were
considered statistically significant.
Results
Characteristics of the SWAN study population
Among the 3240 women at baseline, 43.6% completed
the 13-year follow-up. There were 512 reported incident
and 478 recurrent cases of uterine fibroids throughout the
follow-up period. At baseline, 52.3% of women were pre-
menopausal and 45.3% were early peri-menopausal (Ta-
ble 1). The median age was 46.2 (interquartile range
[IQR], 44.1–48.3) years. Nearly half of women (46.6%)
self-identified as non-Hispanic white, 28.3% as African-
American,8.8%asHispanic,8.6%asJapanese,and7.6%
as Chinese. The median BMI was 26.6 kg/m2 (IQR, 22.9–
32.1 kg/m2). Overall, 42.2% of women had ever smoked,
whereas 17.2% were current smokers. Five or more per-
son-hours/week of passive smoke exposure was reported
in 28.5% of women. At baseline, the median total E2, total
T, and SHBG levels were 55.1 pg/ml (IQR, 32.9–88.4
pg/ml), 41.5 ng/dl (IQR, 29.7–56.3 ng/dl), and 40.9 nM
(IQR, 28.1–57.5 nM), respectively. The baseline median
bioavailable E2 and T indices were 0.5 (IQR, 0.3–0.9) and
3.6 (IQR, 2.2–6.0), respectively.
Associations of potential confounders with risks of
incident and recurrent fibroids

menopause had half the odds of incident fibroids (OR, 0.52;
95% CI, 0.34–0.78; P � .01), compared to premenopausal
women. Age at first birth was inversely associated with risk
of incident fibroids (OR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.95–0.98; P �

 .0001), but parity was not significantly associated. Current
use of exogenous sex hormone therapy was associated with
nearly double the odds of incident fibroids (OR, 2.46; 95%
CI, 1.97–3.07; P � .0001), as was progestin use (OR, 1.77;
95% CI, 1.26–2.50; P � .01).
African-American women had a 73% (95% CI, 34–
123; P � .0001) higher odds of fibroid recurrence com-
pared to non-Hispanic white women, among those who
reported fibroids before baseline, but had an intact
uterus (Table 2). Age at baseline was inversely associ-
ated with risk of recurrent fibroids (OR, 0.96; 95% CI,
0.93–1.00; P � .05). Increased BMI was associated with
an increased risk of fibroid recurrence (OR, 1.59; 95%
CI, 0.99–2.54; P � .05). Women who formerly smoked
had a significant increased risk of fibroid recurrence
compared to never smokers (OR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.02–
1.77; P � .04).
In women with an intact uterus at baseline, with and
without prior report of fibroid occurrence, increased BMI,
African-American race/ethnicity, early peri-menopause,
sex hormone use, progestin use, and passive exposure to
smoke were associated with increased odds of developing
incident or recurrent fibroids (Table 2). FSH was inversely
associated with developing fibroids (OR, 0.995; 95% CI,
0.993–0.997; P � .0001). Increased parity and later age at
first birth were also associated with decreased risk of de-
veloping either incident or recurrent fibroids (OR, 0.96;
95% CI, 0.92–0.99; P � .02) and (OR, 0.97; 95% CI,
0.96–0.98; P � .0001), respectively).
Associations of serum sex hormone levels with
risks of incident and recurrent fibroids
Women with high bioavailable T had a significant 1.33
(95%CI,1.01–1.76;P�.04)timesadjustedoddsofincident
fibroids,comparedtowomenwithlowbioavailableT(Table
3).WomenwithbothhighbioavailableTandE2hadaneven
furtherelevatedriskofincidentfibroidscomparedtowomen
with low levels of both hormones (adjusted OR, 1.52; 95%
CI, 1.07–2.17; P � .02). However, T was not significantly
associated with fibroid recurrence, among women with a
history of fibroids at baseline.

 Women with high bioavailable E2 had a lower adjusted
oddsoffirstfibroidrecurrencecomparedtowomenwithlow
bioavailable E2 (OR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.38–0.98; P � .04).
Those with both high bioavailable T and E2 had an even
lower risk of fibroid recurrence compared to women with
low levels of both hormones (adjusted OR, 0.50; 95% CI,
0.26–0.96;P�.04).However,theassociationbetweenbio-
available E2 and risk of incident fibroids was not statistically
significant.
Amongwomenwithanintactuterusatbaseline,withand
without reported prior fibroids, bioavailable T, DHEAS,
bioavailable E2, and their joint effects were not associated
with developing either incident or recurrent fibroids.
Discussion
To our knowledge, this study is the first longitudinal in-
vestigation of the relationship between serum androgen
and estrogen levels and the development of uterine fi-
broids. Our findings suggest that circulating T and E2 have
opposite effects on the risks of incident and recurrent fi-
broids. Higher T levels were found to be associated with
an increased risk of incident fibroids, but seemingly un-
related to risk of recurrent fibroids. The increased risk of
incident fibroids was further elevated in women with both
high T and E2 levels compared to those with low levels of
both. Conversely, higher E2 levels were found to be asso-

 ciated with lower risk of recurrent fibroids in women
who reported fibroids before study baseline. Further,
women with both high E2 and T levels had an even
greater protective effect against risk of fibroid recur-
rence. However, a significant relationship was not
found between E2 levels and risk of incident fibroids.
When examining all eligible participants who had an
intact uterus at baseline, T, DHEAS, and E2 were not
found to be associated with developing incident or re-
current fibroids. This finding was probably because
their diametrically opposing effects on incident and re-
current fibroids drowned each other out when including
prevalent cases at baseline.
Findings from this study raise the question as to why T
and E2 have opposing relationships with risk of incident
and recurrent fibroids. It should be noted that 70–80% of
women in the general population develop fibroids by age
50 years. The baseline age range of SWAN was 45–52
years. Therefore, restricting the study sample to those who
were free of fibroids at baseline would create a form of
selection bias that limits generalizability to older women,
and would only be relevant to late-onset fibroids. How-
ever, women who had previously reported fibroids before
baseline may have a greater susceptibility of recurrence.
Therefore, there may be heterogeneity in fibroid risk in the
study sample when including both women free of fibroids
and prevalent cases at baseline. As such, we performed
three separate analyses restricting to women at baseline
with an intact uterus who: 1) did not have fibroids, 2)
reported prior fibroids, and 3) did and did not report prior
fibroids as a means to isolate the risk of incident and re-
currentfibroidsseparatelyandtogether.Fromabiological
perspective, differences in the effects of T and E2 on inci-
dent and recurrent fibroids may be due to differences the
expression of estrogen and androgen receptors in the myo-
metrium of women with and without prior fibroids (1).
Higher expression of estrogen and androgen receptors
have been found in fibroids compared to normal myome-
trium (23–25). Previously having fibroids, which were re-
moved by myomectomy, may alter receptor expression
patterns in the vicinity. Furthermore, T and E2 maybe
acting upon receptors on undetected fibroids, whose dis-
tributionsaredifferentbetweenthosewithandwithoutprior
fibroids at baseline. However, previous studies found that
estrogen promotes, rather than inhibits, growth of fibroids
(1). Caution is recommended when interpreting the results.
These findings warrant further investigation of the effect of
androgens and E2 on fibroid risk.

Circulating Sex Hormones and Risk of Fibroids

 The most prominent strength of this study was its lon-
gitudinal design, which established temporality among
time-varying sex hormone levels, covariates, and out-
come. SWAN is a unique community-based cohort with
extensive participant characterization and near-annual re-
peated measurements of serum sex hormone measure-
ments. The repeated measurements allowed the long-term
longitudinal trajectories of sex hormone levels and perti-
nent factors over time to be evaluated in relation to fibroid
risk. Additionally, the multiethnic composition of SWAN
improves generalizability of the findings to the US
population.
However, this investigation had limitations. First, the as-
sessment of fibroids relied on self-report of previous medical
diagnosis.SWANdidnotassessfibroidsize,number,orclas-
sification. Many uterine fibroids are asymptomatic; there-
fore, most of the reported cases of fibroids were likely to be
symptomatic. Differential misclassification of the outcome
may occur if higher sex hormone levels affects fibroid size,
number, or classification, thus altering detection rates (26).
However,undersamplingasymptomaticwomenwithhigher
T or E2 would likely bias the estimates toward the null and
lead to conservative estimates of risk. Second, random
mismeasurement of sex hormone levels would likely conser-
vatively underestimate the effects. Third, near-annual sex
hormone measurements, especially of E2, may not fully cap-
ture the short-term dynamic changes during the MT, and the
timing of blood sampling may be challenging because of ir-
regular menstrual cycling that is common to women with
fibroidsandwomenundergoingtheMT.However,timingof
bloodcollectionrelatedtothemenstrualcyclewascontrolled
in theanalyses.Fourth,unmeasuredconfoundersmayhavein-
troducedbiaseventhoughmajorknownconfoundersfrompre-
vious literature were controlled. In particular, LH and serum
progesterone may be important factors related to fibroids and
E2, but were not measured in SWAN (27, 28). However, time-
varying progestin use was controlled in the analysis.
Androgens and androgen receptors are expressed in
fibroid tissue (14). Androgens are direct precursors of es-
trogens via conversion by aromatase; the mechanism by
which T may increase the risk and growth of uterine fi-
broids could be via its conversion to E2 (29). Moreover,
the overexpression of aromatase in fibroid tissue suggests
that androgen might play an important role in fibroid de-
velopment (15, 16). The lack of association between
DHEAS and risk of fibroids may be due to its weak an-
drogenic effects and lack of aromatization compared to T
(30). Exogenous and endogenous estrogen are established
factors in the development of uterine fibroids (5, 10, 12).
Endogenous E2 levels dramatically decrease in menopause
(31). Consistent with previous studies, we found that late
peri- and post-menopausal women had lower risk of fi-
broids compared to pre-menopausal women (1).
African-American women had a substantially higher
risk for uterine fibroids compared to non-Hispanic white
women in our study. This finding was consistent with
prior studies, which found that African-Americans were
more likely to have a clinical diagnosis of uterine fibroids,
with more severe related symptoms than white women (7,
8, 32–34). Higher passive smoke exposure was associated
with an increased risk of fibroids. Further investigation
into the relationship between passive smoke exposure and
fibroid risk may be warranted.
In summary, findings from this longitudinal study of
midlife women suggest that higher levels of both bioavail-
able T and E2 is related to an increased risk of incident
fibroids in the ensuing year in women who never previ-
ously reported them, but is related to a decreased risk of
recurrent fibroids in women who previously reported
them. Considering the individual and joint effects of cir-
culating T and E2 levels on fibroid risk could help in iden-
tifying high-risk midlife women and developing person-
alizednonsurgicaltherapeuticoptions.Futurestudiesmay
benefit from focusing on both the short-term and long-
termdynamicsofsexhormonebalanceinthedevelopment
of fibroids. Furthermore, a longer follow-up time begin-
ning earlier in adulthood could improve the understand-
ingoftherelationshipbetweensexhormonedynamicsand
fibroid risk across the life-course of women.
