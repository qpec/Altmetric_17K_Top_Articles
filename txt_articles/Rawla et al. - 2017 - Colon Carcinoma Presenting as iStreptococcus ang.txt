Abstract
A collection of dead white blood cells within the liver is called a liver 
abscess, and pyogenic liver abscess (PLA) is the most common type. 
PLA is commonly associated with biliary tract infections. However, 
in this case report, we present a rare cause of Streptococcus angino-
sus bacteremia and PLA which is associated with a carcinoma of the 
colon at the splenic flexure. The presentation mimicked a cholecys-
titis clinically, but the radio-imaging revealed a liver abscess. Blood 
cultures revealed an uncommon etiological agent, S. anginosus group 
which is otherwise a commensal in the human gut. In this case report, 
we aimed to summarize the microbiological aspects of S. anginosus 
group of organisms, the relevant clinicopathological considerations 
and the management.

Introduction
A liver abscess is defined as a collection of dead white blood 
cells within the liver. Liver abscess may thus be classified 
into three based on the etiology, namely pyogenic (bacterial), 
amoebic and fungal liver abscess. Among the three types, pyo-
genic liver abscess (PLA) is the most common type, account-
ing for 80% of all cases [1]. In 1938, Ochsner et al published a 
review of 47 cases and concluded that surgical drainage is the 
definitive therapy for PLA, but mortality remained at 60-80% 
[2]. With the advent of newer radiological techniques, better 
microbiological isolation techniques and availability of anti-
biotics, the mortality has drastically come down to 5-30% [1]. 
Here we present a case of Streptococcus anginosus bacteremia 
complicated by PLA secondary to colon cancer which is also a 
rarer risk factor for the development of PLA.
Case Report
A 62-year-old gentleman who is known to suffer from hyperten-
sion, dyslipidemia, and hypothyroidism for the past 15 years, 
presented to the emergency room with complaints of high-grade 
intermittent fever with chills but no associated rigors for the 
past 2 days. He also complained of minimal abdominal discom-
fort in the right upper quadrant and rated the pain at 2 on a pain 
scale of 10. There was no radiation, no known aggravating or 
relieving factors associated with the pain. There was no history 
of any nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, other symptoms suggestive 
of urinary tract or respiratory tract infection. He was a chronic 
user of tobacco with a history smoking cigarettes amounting to 
40 pack years over the last 40 years. He also consumes alco-
hol socially and gives no history of any intravenous (IV) drug 
abuse. His current medication history includes amlodipine 10 
mg and lisinopril 40 mg once daily for his hypertension, levo-
thyroxine 50 µg once daily for hypothyroidism and atorvastatin 
20 mg once daily at night for dyslipidemia.
On general physical examination, the patient had no pal-
lor, icterus, lymphadenopathy or edema. He was running a 
temperature of 102 °F (38.9 °C) and was tachycardic with a 
heart rate of 110 beats per minute. His blood pressure on the 
right upper arm was measured at lying down posture as 90/60 
mm Hg. Upon abdominal examination, there was mild tender-
ness in the right upper quadrant with no guarding or rebound 
tenderness. Cardiac examination revealed no murmurs and 
respiratory system examination was unremarkable.
A working diagnosis of cholecystitis was made at this junc-
ture, and further investigations were proposed to confirm the 
diagnosis. The blood testing results are summarized in Table 1. 
There was leukocytosis with 70% neutrophils, but liver func-
tion tests were normal. The patient underwent a CT abdomen 
with contrast. This identified an abscess in the right lobe of liver 
about 15 mm in diameter (Fig. 1) with no evidence of any gall-
stones or other abnormalities. An ultrasound scan of the right 
upper abdomen also reported the same findings and ruled out 
cholecystitis as there was no pericholecystic fluid found. Two

sets of blood cultures were sent, and he was started on empiric 
antibiotic treatment with IV vancomycin, metronidazole, and 
piperacillin-tazobactam. Meanwhile, all blood cultures grew 
Streptococcus anginosus, and the antibiotic treatment was de-
escalated to ceftriaxone 2 g once daily IV based on the sensi-
tivity pattern. At this juncture, an opinion was sought from the 
interventional radiologist who opined that the abscess need not 
be drained as it was small and loculated, rather treat conserva-
tively with IV antibiotics. Repeat blood cultures sent 2 days 
after starting antibiotic treatment turned out to be negative.
The patient was questioned further to investigate the pos-
sible source of infection except for a history of significant un-
explained weight loss of about 15 pounds in the last 3 months. 
The patient then underwent a two-dimensional echocardio-
gram which ruled out any vegetation or valvular abnormalities. 
Trans-esophageal echocardiography was also normal. Mean-
while, the patient was discharged with a peripherally inserted 
central line to continue IV ceftriaxone for a total period of 4 
weeks and to follow-up in the outpatient department (OPD) 
with colonoscopy. Subsequently, the following week, the pa-
tient had a colonoscopy done on OPD basis and was diagnosed 
to have colon carcinoma at the splenic flexure (Fig. 2). Biopsy 
of the colonic mass confirmed it as adenocarcinoma.
Discussion
The S. anginosus group belongs to the subgroup of viridans 
Streptococci. This group consists of three distinct Streptococ-
cal species, namely S. anginosus, S. intermedius and S. con-
stellatus [3]. These organisms were first isolated by Guthof 
in 1956 from dental abscesses and are gram-positive, cata-
lase-negative cocci. They are non-motile facultative anaer-
obes that may demonstrate alpha, beta or gamma hemolysis 
on blood agar [4]. The colony size on agar is typically less 
than 0.5 mm with a buttery butterscotch-like smell, and they 
demonstrate enhanced growth in the presence of carbon di-
oxide, while some of them need anaerobic conditions [5]. S. 
anginosus group is considered a part of the normal human 
flora mostly in the mouth, sinuses, throat, feces, and vagina. 
They rarely cause infection in a healthy individual [6]. The 
two most common places where the blood-mucosal barrier is 
breached due to a local infection are in the gastrointestinal-
pancreatico-hepatobiliary tracts and the thoracic cavity. These 
organisms are known for their tendency towards abscess for-
mation. A case series with 51 patients reported that only six of 
them had associated abscesses and 53% of them had a local 
site of infection [7].
There is not much clinical need in distinguishing the mem-
bers of the S. anginosus group. They usually present as polymi-
crobial infections [8]. The main pathogenesis in the formation 
of a deep seated abscess by the anginosus group is the produc-
tion of an exotoxin by S. intermedius called intermedilysin. 
This is a cytolytic toxin which is specific for human cells es-
pecially for the hepatocytes [9]. They also produce hydrolytic 
enzymes which aid in liquefaction of pus and further spread of 
infection within the affected tissue [10]. It is also believed that 
interaction of the organism and polymorphonuclear cells may 
also play a role in the development of abscess formation [11]. 
In our patient, the colon cancer has resulted in the loss of in-
tegrity of the blood-mucosal barrier which has probably led to 
the S. anginosus bacteremia which is otherwise a normal com-
mensal of the gut. Further to this, since the portal circulation is 
the first capillary bed, these organisms have accumulated in the 
liver parenchyma leading to an abscess [12].

The management approach of positive blood culture with 
S. anginosus group warrants a thorough search for an under-
lying deep abscess. In our patient, liver abscess was picked 
up prominently by the radio-imaging. The management of an 
abscess warrants surgical draining and debridement with intra-
venous antibiotics. If the abscess is small or there are multiple 
abscesses where draining is not practical, prolonged antimi-
crobial therapy as long as 6 - 8 weeks is indicated [13]. Our 
patient was thus discharged with IV ceftriaxone based on the 
culture sensitivity report to be followed up weekly to assess 
the clinical improvement and was further referred to specialty 
treatment for the colon cancer.
Association of colorectal carcinoma with few microbial 
agents like group D streptococcus has been well implicated, 
though evidence as an etiological agent is contradictory. Simi-
larly, there exists a serious doubt whether such an association 
exists between S. anginosus and colorectal carcinoma. Few 
case reports with similar association have already been pub-
lished by Lin et al [14], Tzur et al [15], Millichap et al [16] 
and Masood et al [17]. Also, S. anginosus bacteremia has also 
been reported in patients with esophageal and gastric carci-
noma [18].
Conclusion
Though S. anginosus group of organisms is a common com-
mensal in the human gut, they are known to cause bacteremia 
when the blood mucosal integrity is lost. Bacteremia should 
warrant a thorough check for any underlying deep seated ab-
scess as this group of Streptococci are known to cause ab-
scesses, unlike the other Streptococci. Bacteremia is managed 
through IV antibiotics until clinical symptoms improve. Ab-
scesses are usually treated surgically along with IV antibiotics. 
However, if draining is not possible, the management is con-
servative with prolonged IV antibiotics. Besides treatment of 
the abscess and bacteremia, the underlying cause is appropri-
ately treated. Further epidemiological studies are warranted to 
identify if there is any association between S. anginosus bacte-
remia and colorectal carcinoma. Further studies are needed to 
find out if screening colonoscopy in patients with S. anginosus 
bacteremia is warranted.
