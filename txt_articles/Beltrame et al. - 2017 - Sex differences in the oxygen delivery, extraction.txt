Abstract 
Previous studies in children and older adults demonstrated faster oxygen uptake (�� ��) kinetics in 
males compared to females, but young health adults have not been studied. We hypothesized that 
young men would have faster aerobic system dynamics in response to the onset of exercise than 
women. Interactions between oxygen supply and utilization were characterized by the dynamics 
of �� ��, deoxyhemoglobin (���), tissue saturation index (���), cardiac output (�� ) and 
calculated arteriovenous �� difference (� − �������) in women and men. Eighteen healthy 
active young women and men (9 of each sex) with similar aerobic fitness level volunteered for 
this study. Participants performed an incremental cardiopulmonary treadmill exercise test and 
three moderate intensity treadmill exercise tests (at 80 % �� �� of gas exchange threshold). Data 
related to the moderate exercise were submitted to exponential data modeling to obtain 
parameters related to the aerobic system dynamics. The time constants of �� ��, � − �������, 
��� and ��� (30±6, 29±1, 16±1 and 15±2 s, respectively) in women were statistically (�<0.05) 
faster than the time constants in men (42±10, 49±21, 19±3 and 20±4 s, respectively). Although ��  
dynamics were not statistically different (�=0.06) between groups, there was a trend to slower ��  
dynamics in men corresponding with the slower �� �� kinetics. These results indicated that the 
peripheral and pulmonary oxygen extraction dynamics were remarkably faster in women. Thus, 
contrary to the hypothesis, �� �� dynamics measured at the mouth at the onset of submaximal 
treadmill walking were faster in women compared to men.

Introduction 
The characterization of the oxygen uptake (�� ��) dynamics during exercise transition can 
be used to investigate the adjustments of the aerobic response to supply a new energetic demand 
(Krogh and Lindhard 1913). The rate at which the �� �� increases at the beginning of exercise 
seems to be determined by the integrative control of several mechanisms involving the �� 
transport by the circulation and its utilization by the myocyte (Hughson and Morrissey 1983, 
Grassi et al. 1996, Macdonald et al. 1997, Rossiter et al. 1999, Hughson 2009, Beltrame and 
Hughson 2017). 
The greater maximal aerobic power of men compared to women is well recognized 
(Cureton et al. 1986). Nevertheless, the sex influences over the aerobic response dynamics 
during moderate exercise transition are not fully understood. Previous studies observed faster 
�� �� kinetics in pre-pubertal and adolescent males compared to females (Fawkner and Armstrong 
2004, Franco et al. 2014, Lai et al. 2016). In older adults, sex-differences explained some 
variation in �� �� kinetics (Chilibeck et al. 1995), but another study observed no difference 
between men and women in healthy or diabetic populations (O’Connor et al. 2012). Other factors 
in women including better autonomic control of heart rate (Rossy and Thayer 1998, Dart et al. 
2002) and higher predominance of slow-twitch muscle fibers (Nygaard 1981) might be expected 
to speed �� �� dynamics during exercise transition (Hughson 1984, Powers et al. 1985, Barstow et 
al. 1996), but there are no data to address this in young men and women. Despite potential 
differences in the aerobic responses between sexes,  some studies (Bauer et al. 2007, Endo et al. 
2007) investigated the �� �� dynamics in men and women as a single group which could mislead 
the interpretation of the results and underlying mechanisms if sex-differences are involved in 
�� �� control.

No investigation to date performed measurements in men and women that allowed the 
simultaneous investigation of �� �� kinetics and the contributions of the �� delivery-utilization 
systems during exercise transition. Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and estimation of cardiac 
output (�� ) can be used to assess the �� delivery-utilization distortions in vivo (Ferrari et al. 1997, 
Faisal et al. 2010, Murias et al. 2011). These variables, when obtained simultaneously with �� �� 
data, offer the opportunity to study how the �� delivery-utilization balance differs between 
women and men, and how this might impact the rate at which the aerobic system supplies the 
energy demand.  
Therefore, the purpose of this cross-sectional study was to further explore how sex 
influences the �� �� response during exercise transition with simultaneous measurement of NIRS 
and �� . We hypothesized that in healthy young adults, similar to previous studies of children, 
men would have faster �� �� dynamics in comparison to women, and that this would be supported 
by a better �� delivery and extraction in men. 
  
Methods 
Participants 
Eighteen healthy, recreationally active young adults (9 women and 9 men) of similar age 
and body mass index (women = age 23±3 years, height 164±7 cm, weight 62.9±5.9 kg, and BMI 
23.2±1.2 kg/m2 and men = age 29±6 years, height 181±8 cm, weight 81.1±11.1 kg, and BMI 
24.6±2 kg/m2) without any cardiovascular or orthopedic complications volunteered for this 
study. Women and men presented similar submaximal fitness level evaluated by gas exchange 
threshold (���). Participants were evaluated during walking activities on a previously calibrated 
treadmill (error lower than 1% for speeds between 0.5 to 8 km·h-1) (Bodyguard, St-Georges, QB,

Canada). Walking, instead of cycling, was performed to incorporate the most common activity of 
daily living. Participants signed a written informed consent after receiving detailed information 
about the experimental procedures and potential risks involved. They were aware of their right to 
withdraw from the study at any time. The study procedures were reviewed and approved by the 
Office of Research Ethics at the University of Waterloo and in agreement with Declaration of 
Helsinki. It was requested of all participants to not consume a large meal within 2 h prior testing, 
not drink alcohol and caffeinated beverages as well as not perform high intensity exercise for 24 
h prior testing. 
 
Experimental Design 
Data were collected on two separate visits. The first visit consisted of incremental 
cardiopulmonary exercise testing, while the second visit consisted of three moderate walking 
exercise tests. Following the measurement of height and weight, a 3-lead electrocardiogram 
(ECG) electrodes were applied over the participant’s skin and an air cushion mask was fitted to 
the participant’s face to allow measurement of gas exchange. Prior to testing, all individuals were 
trained to step on the treadmill in motion according to speed and inclination requirements and 
familiarized with the protocols. Experiments were performed in a quiet room with temperature 
and humidity relatively constant (22.4 ± 0.5 ºC, 23.4 ± 0.9% respectively) and barometric 
pressure of 728.7 ± 4.4 mmHg. 
 
Experimental Protocols 
The incremental cardiopulmonary exercise testing protocol consisted of 1-minute 
baseline, 6-minute warm-up at 4.5 km·h-1 no slope, followed by a new increment in speed

(individual maximum walking speed of ~6 km·h-1) and then progressive increments in grade 
(1%·min-1). The test was terminated when subjects reached 80% of their predicted maximal heart 
rate. This protocol was performed in order to obtain individual ��� (Beaver et al. 1986) that was 
used to calculate the relative moderate work rate performed in the following laboratory visit. On 
the second visit, participants performed three identical walking exercises at a work rate 
corresponding to 80% of their �� �� at ��� (Ozyener et al. 2001). This protocol included 1 
minute of baseline standing at the treadmill edge followed by 6 min walking at individual 
selected speeds and grades and 6 minutes of recovery. 
To minimize any carry over effect between exercise bouts, seated recovery periods 
between all constant work rate exercise tests lasted at least 20 min. The treadmill was operating 
at the target speed even during baseline for at least 5 min to avoid anticipatory responses. To 
indicate when participants should start walking on the treadmill, a computer monitor was placed 
at the participant’s eye level to control the transitions. 
 
Data acquisition 
Breath-by-breath measurements of pulmonary �� �� and carbon dioxide output (�� ���) 
were taken during tests. A low dead space, bidirectional, low resistance turbine was used to 
measure inhale/exhale air volumes and flows (UVM-1725, Vacumed, Ventura, California, USA) 
and it was attached to an air cushion mask (Vacumed, Ventura, California, USA) for a total 
system dead space of 170 mL. A 3 L syringe using different flow rates (0.5 to 2 L·s-1) was used 
to calibrate the turbine prior to each test bout. Air samples inside the mask were sent to a mass 
spectrometer (Amis 2000, Innovision, Odense, Denmark) by a short sample line (~1.5 m). The 
system gas concentration calibration was performed using gas tanks with known ��, ���, ��,

and �� concentrations. The turbine and mass spectrometer signals were synchronized and 
utilized in the estimation of �� �� and �� ��� (Hughson et al. 1991). 
 
The heart rate beat-by-beat calculation was derived from the ECG signal (Pilot 9200, 
Colin Medical Instruments, San Antonio, TX, USA) recorded with LabChart 7.3.7 
(ADInstruments, Colorado Springs, CO, USA). The finger arterial pressure signal (Finometer, 
Finapres Medical System, Arnhem, The Netherlands) was used to provide a beat-by-beat 
estimate of  Q
�  as previously validated for exercise (Faisal et al. 2009). The total arteriovenous �� 
difference (� − �������) was calculated by the ratio �� ��/�� and it was used as a proxy of the 
total venous �� content during exercise transition (Barstow et al. 1990). 
A multi-distance continuous-wave single channel near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) 
(PortaLite, Artinis Medical Systems B.V., Elst, The Netherlands) evaluated changes in 
Gastrocnemius Lateralis muscle oxy- (����) and deoxy-hemo/myoglobin (���) concentrations 
(expressed in ��) sampled at a rate of 10 Hz. The light emitting probe was composed by three 
light-emitting diodes operating at two wavelengths (λ1=845 and λ2=759 nm) with an average 
light in/out distances of ~ 35 mm. The probe was placed in the target area and the device was 
warmed-up for at least 30 min before the data collection. To avoid any motion artifact and 
ambient light influences, the probe was fixed by tape and then a dark cloth was gently wrapped 
around the calf.  
The tissue saturation index (���) was calculated as the percent of �� for a given capillary 
blood volume. Any probe movement was checked in real-time by the correlation level (��) 
between the light in/out distance and the optical density. During the entire data collection, the �� 
was > 98% indicating appropriate signal quality. The adipose tissue thickness (���) was 
determined by measurements of the Gastrocnemius lateral head skinfold thickness using a

skinfold caliper. The ��� did not exceed the minimum penetration depth of the NIRS system 
calculated as the half of the light in/out distance (35 �� 2 
�
= 17.5 ��). The average ��� was 
7.06 ± 2.57 mm, or ~40% lower than the NIRS light penetration depth. The ��� was not 
correlated to any variable evaluated in this study. The selected ��� and ���� signals were 
related to the deepest penetrating transmitter of the NIRS (i.e., highest light in/out distance) in 
order to diminish the influence of skin blood flow over the target signals. 
 
Data analysis 
The data from the constant work rate protocols were linearly interpolated and re-sampled 
at 1 Hz. The signals for each of the three constant work rate exercise transitions were time-
aligned with time zero matching the onset of walking exercise. The data from the three 
repetitions were ensemble-averaged generating a single exercise dataset per participant. 
Afterwards, a 5-s moving average was used for filtering to reduce the influence of the inter-
breath oscillations (Lamarra et al. 1987), narrowing the confidence interval of the parameters to 
be estimated (Keir et al. 2014). Finally, the kinetics of �� ��, �� , �� and � − ������� were 
analyzed by the bi-exponential model following previous literature (Hughson et al. 1988):

is time (independent variable); “��” is the mean value during baseline; “��” and “��” are the 
steady-state amplitudes for the cardio-dynamic and fundamental phases, respectively; 
“��”and “��” are time constants for each phase; “���” and “���” are time delays for each phase. 
For all variables, the steady-state of the cardio-dynamic phase (i.e., 4*[��+���]) coincided with 
the beginning of the fundamental phase (i.e., ���), so that phase 1 had minimal impact on fitting 
of phase 2. The mean response time (���) was calculated by the sum of ��� and �� (i.e.,

��� = ��� + ��) and used as an index to describe the overall kinetic response during transition 
(Linnarsson 1974). The quality of the fitting was assured by the analysis of residuals, degree of 
linear correlation between the experimental data and fitted function (�), 95% confidence interval 
band (����) (Fawkner et al. 2002, Keir et al. 2016) and the significance level (� value) of the 
estimated parameters. 
The NIRS signals were normalized by the average of the data during 30 s prior the onset 
of exercise for better data visualization. The ��� and ��� time constants were obtained 
following a previously described method (DeLorey et al. 2003, Murias et al. 2011). Data not 
directly associated to the muscular �� �� dynamics (DeLorey et al. 2003) were excluded based on 
the detection of two nadir values for each individual exercise transition dataset. The first portion 
of excluded data was related to the muscle pump. The first nadir occurred at 11±0.6 and 11.6±1.3 
s for women and men, respectively. This period was characterized by a sudden decrease in ��� 
signal (Figure 1A) with a simultaneous increase in ��� as a consequence of an elevated initial 
blood flow that surpasses the �� �� increase (Tschakovsky et al. 2006) decreasing the �� 
extraction (Murias et al. 2014). After this first nadir, the ��� increased and ��� decreased 
following an exponential-like function. It is believed that this behavior is a consequence of the 
�� �� dynamics characteristics during exercise transition, and therefore the phase of interest 
(Figure 1A) (Murias et al. 2011).  
Instead of studying the influence of data window selection over the parameters estimation 
by arbitrarily choosing different time intervals (Dumanoir et al. 2010, Murias et al. 2011, Keir et 
al. 2016), the end of the data window was selected according to the identification of a second 
nadir (Bauer et al. 2004). Due to the late overshooting characteristics of the ��� signal (Bauer 
et al. 2007) usually more pronounced in women, the second nadir was set when a systematic

increase in capillary blood volume assessed by the total hemoglobin (��� = ���+����) was 
observed after a brief period of steady-state (─ ─ in Figure 1B). This increment in the capillary 
blood volume (Truijen et al. 2012) might be occurring due to temperature increase that elevates 
skin blood flow and/or due to the local metabolites action over the capillary bed. The second 
nadir occurred after 37±8 and 41±11 s for women and men, respectively. To avoid 
misinterpretation of the ��� dynamics associated to non-steady capillary blood volume (Kime 
et al. 2013), both nadirs were used to select the optimized data widow to be fitted. 
 
(Figure 1) 
 
To facilitate comparison with previous literature (Murias et al. 2011, 2014), we 
implemented an exponential fitting procedure on the selected data. The ��� data contained 
between the two nadirs were fitted by the equation: ���(�) = �� + �� ∗ �1 − �
�������
��
��, as 
depicted in Figure 1A. The equation parameters are the same as previously described. The 
selected ��� data were fitted by the same equation but instead of adding the exponential 
component to the ��, it was decreased from the ��. Since the response can be interpreted as a 
non-delayed local response, the ��� of the ��� and ��� (���-��� and ���-���, 
respectively) was also calculated by the sum of �� and ��� and considered as the only time 
constant for these variables (Murias et al. 2011, Allart et al. 2012). All data modeling parameters 
were calculated by a G-language computer program developed by a certified LabVIEW 
programmer (LabVIEW 2012, National Instruments, Austin, TX, USA). This program fitted the 
data using a nonlinear curve fit function that finds the lowest sum of the squared errors by a 
standard Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm.

Statistical Analysis 
Data were expressed as mean ± SD. The one-way repeated measures ANOVA was used 
to compare the �� �� baseline between the three bouts of moderate walking exercise to confirm no 
carryover effects prior to ensemble averaging to achieve a single exercise transition per 
participant. For comparison of the parameters obtained by the kinetics analysis between women 
and men, Shapiro-Wilk test was used to assess data distribution. The t-test or Mann-Whitney 
Rank Sum test was used for comparisons between men and women for normal and non-normal 
data distribution, respectively. The established cut-off significance level was 5% (� < 0.05). 
Statistical analysis was performed using SigmaPlot 12.5 software (Systat Software Inc, San Jose, 
CA, USA). 
 
Results 
The incremental treadmill test was terminated at 80% predicted maximal heart rate. At 
this point of peak exercise, the �� was not different (� > 0.05) between women (149.0±2.6 bpm) 
and men (152.7±5.5 bpm). However, absolute and relative �� ��  in men (2945±648 ml·min-1 and 
36.27±6.09 ml·min-1·kg-1, respectively) were higher (� = 0.003 and � = 0.001, respectively) than 
in women (1870±211 ml·min-1 and 29.80±2.72 ml·min-1·kg-1, respectively). 
The selected treadmill grade at 80% of ��� was not different between groups (6±1 % for 
women and 6±2 % for men, � < 0.05). Women were shorter than men (� < 0.05) thus, as 
expected, the treadmill speed at 80% of ��� was also slower in women (3.4±0.0 km·h-1 for 
women and 3.9±0.2 km·h-1 for men, � < 0.05). The �� ��  at ��� was not different between 
groups (26±3 ml·min-1·kg-1 for women and 30±5 ml·min-1·kg-1 for men, � < 0.05).

The one-way repeated-measures ANOVA indicated that there were no statistically 
significant differences between the �� �� baseline (initial condition) of three bouts of moderate 
walking exercise.  Figure 2A displays the normalized second-by-second group response of the 
�� ��  during exercise transitions. According to Figure 2B, the �� �� -��� was significantly faster 
in women in comparison to men (� < 0.05). The �� -��� approached statistical significance (� = 
0.06), with women having faster ��� than men. The ��-��� was not statistically (� > 0.05) 
different between women and men.

The second-by-second ��� and ��� data (Figures 3A and 3B, respectively) for the 
region of interest (selected as described in Figure 1) revealed a statistically (� < 0.05) faster 
adaptation in women. The exponential characteristics of the response were evident and the data 
modeling presented low residuals, as well as low ���� and � values. 
 
(insert Figure 3) 
 
Table 1 shows the comparison of the data fitting parameters between women and men. 
The statistical analysis indicated that women presented lower �� ��-�� relative to weight or 
absolute values (� < 0.05) and faster �� ��-�� in comparison to men, but no differences for the 
parameters ��, ��� and ���. The parameters �� and �� relative to weight were not different 
between women and men (� > 0.05). However, the �� and �� absolute values were higher (� = 
0.002 and � = 0.011, respectively) in men in comparison with women.  The initial cardio-

dynamic component of the ��  response (i.e., �� -��) was less pronounced in women (� < 0.05). 
The �� -�� was not different between women and men. In addition, no differences (� > 0.05) were 
found in ��  for the parameters ��, ��, ��, �� and ���. The ��  baseline amplitude (i.e., ��) and the 
�� -��� also approached statistical significance between groups (� = 0.06) being both lower in 
women. In comparison to men, the faster local oxygen extraction (faster ���-���) found in 
women was also associated with faster pulmonary �� extraction investigated by � − �������-
��. The � − ������� parameters ��, ��, ��, ��, ��� and ��� were not different (� > 0.05) 
between groups. Like �� , the ��� for � − ������� also approached statistical significance (� = 
0.06) with women having a faster response than men. The ��-�� was higher (� < 0.05) in 
women in comparison to men. However, the �� parameters ��, ��, ��, ��, ��� and ��� did not 
present statistical differences (� > 0.05) between groups.

Discussion 
To the best of our knowledge, this was the first time that the integrative cardiovascular 
and metabolic responses have been compared in young, healthy men and women during the 
dynamic adaptive phase of moderate intensity walking exercise. The main finding of the current 
study showed that women presented faster �� �� dynamics in comparison to men. This was 
contrary to our initial hypothesis, but consistent with a strong trend for faster central �� transport 
(�� ), as well as remarkably faster peripheral and pulmonary �� extraction dynamics in women in 
comparison to men.

In contrast to previous studies that reported faster �� �� kinetics in younger boys compared 
to girls (Fawkner et al. 2002, Franco et al. 2014, Lai et al. 2016) and an investigation of 55-year-
old men and women that reported no difference in �� �� kinetics between the sexes (O’Connor et 
al. 2012), we observed significantly faster responses in young, healthy women compared to men. 
The current study demonstrated that sex influenced the aerobic adaptation during moderate 
walking. In the rest to exercise transition, women presented �� �� dynamics ~28 % faster in 
comparison to men as indicated by the faster �� (Figure 2A) and ��� (Table 1). In addition, as 
depicted in Figure 3, the ��� and ��� adaptive responses (���) in women were respectively 
19 % and 22 % faster than men, indicating a faster peripheral �� extraction (���) and �� 
desaturation (���) dynamics, respectively. Despite the lack of statistical significance of the ��  
temporal dynamics (i.e., �� -���) between groups, the mean effect size of ≈ 25% associated with 
a statistical significance level (�) of 0.06 cannot be overlooked. The observed faster �� �� 
dynamics in women might be also associated with faster ��  dynamics reflecting �� transport in 
addition to the statistically significant faster �� extraction. Consequently, the blood with lower 
�� content might be reaching the lungs faster in women which would support, according to Fick 
principle, the remarkable faster pulmonary �� �� observed in this group.  
The faster �� �� dynamics for the same relative metabolic demand (80% ���) showed 
that women were able to utilize aerobic rather than anaerobic metabolism to supply the energetic 
demand during exercise transition. This is true even if faster ��  dynamics might distort the 
interpretation of muscle �� �� dynamics (Hoffmann et al. 1992, 2013). The mechanisms that 
underlie the more rapid increase in �� �� are complex. The capillary density of the gastrocnemius 
muscle seems to be similar between women and men (Coggan et al. 1992), but women have 
lower hemoglobin concentration (Vahlquist 1950) and possibly different respiratory function

(Harms and Rosenkranz 2008) which contributes with ��  dynamics to affect convective �� 
transport. 
In order to diminish the influence of other variables beyond sex over the aerobic response 
(Lundsgaard and Kiens 2014), women and men were similar in their age, BMI and ���. 
Differences between matched men and women in observed pulmonary �� �� might also reflect 
muscle metabolic potential. Women apparently have a higher slow-twitch muscle fiber 
composition which has a better oxidative capacity (Staron et al. 2000, Lundsgaard and Kiens 
2014, Haizlip et al. 2015). Different muscle type compositions has an impact over the �� �� 
measured at the mouth and as expected greater recruitment of slow-twitch fiber will speed up the 
aerobic system energy supply during exercise transitions (Crow and Kushmerick 1982, Barstow 
et al. 1996). In addition, it was reported that women have similar cytochrome � oxidase (Rouleau 
et al. 1995) activity in comparison to matched men. In addition, the mitochondrial content and 
myocyte respiration was reported to be similar between women and men for the same muscle 
fiber type (Thompson et al. 2013). Therefore, the observed faster aerobic adjustment in the 
current study might be accounted for in part by a higher composition or recruitment of slow-
twitch muscle in women.  
Women have a greater reliance on fat oxidation in comparison to men during dynamic 
exercise (Tarnopolsky et al. 1990, Tarnopolsky 2008) which should also influence the �� �� 
dynamics during exercise transition (Molé and Hoffmann 1999). However, �� �� dynamics were 
slowed during a high fat diet intervention (Raper et al. 2014), contrary to the observed faster �� �� 
adjustment in women of the current study. Nonetheless, despite the impossibility of exactly 
identifying the intracellular mechanisms that trigger a faster �� �� dynamics in women, the faster 
peripheral �� extraction in the capillary bed lead to a faster detachment of the �� from the ����,

accelerating the dynamics of ��� concentration and the blood �� desaturation (i.e. ���) (Figure 
3). As previously described (Hughson 2009), interactions of �� transport and �� delivery 
mechanisms establish the rate of increase in �� �� accounting for differences between men and 
women.  
Regarding the quality of the parameters estimation, the data modeling presented elevated 
reliability which allowed us to infer about the aerobic system response profile based on the 
parameters estimated from the �� �� data measured at the mouth (Lamarra et al. 1987, Keir et al. 
2014). The ���� of the �� ��-�� (main variable) was not statistically (� > 0.05) different between 
women (2.2±0.5 s) and men (2.6±0.5) and corresponded to ~7 and ~6 % of the women’s and 
men’s group mean response, respectively. 
 
Study Limitations 
Comparison studies of sex-differences in responses to exercise are complicated by 
multiple factors. Women are smaller and have relatively greater fat mass, on average, than men 
(Charkoudian and Joyner 2004). In addition to the lower hemoglobin concentration (Vahlquist 
1950), women have smaller stroke volume and reduced total systemic oxygen transport 
(Wheatley et al. 2014). Differences in maximal aerobic power when expressed per kg body mass 
are partially compensated when expressed per kg lean body mass, but an average 15% difference 
still exists (Peltonen et al. 2013). Lower maximal aerobic power or �� �� at GET might be 
explained by training status or by leg strength (Neder et al. 1999). In the current study, the 
statistically similar �� �� at GET in men and women might indicate that the women were 
relatively more physically fit which could account for the faster �� �� kinetics in women. This 
seems, though, to be unlikely in the current study as the levels of physical activity were similar

in the young, healthy students studied. Future studies should systematically address these issues 
related to fitness and normalization of metabolic demand.  
Cardiovascular responses to exercise across the menstrual cycle have not been 
extensively studied, nor extensively compared to men. Peak reactive hyperemia is greatest in the 
late follicular phase of the menstrual cycle highlighting the impact of hormonal concentrations 
on vascular endothelial function (Adkisson et al. 2010). Muscle blood flow is greater in women 
than men with single leg knee extension and forearm exercise when tested in the early follicular 
(first 5-7 days) of the menstrual cycle (Parker et al. 2007, Kellawan et al. 2015). For young 
women tested in the follicular and luteal phases of the menstrual cycle, there were no differences 
in �� �� kinetics or muscle deoxygenation patterns at the onset of moderate intensity exercise 
(Gurd et al. 2007). In the current study, we did not standardize the phase of the menstrual cycle, 
but we did find clear differences between men and women. These results establish a basis for 
continued research to explore mechanisms related to muscle blood flow and its distribution 
patterns as well as explorations of metabolic control at the onset of exercise in women as well as 
in men. 
The current study used treadmill exercise rather than the more commonly studied cycle 
ergometer exercise. The kinetics of �� �� are reported to be similar for cycling and treadmill 
(Koschate et al. 2016), but to date the exercise modes have only been compared in men. It is not 
known if women might respond differently to treadmill exercise.   
 
Conclusion 
In spite of no difference in submaximal aerobic fitness as indicated by the �� �� at gas 
exchange threshold, women presented a faster �� �� dynamics during walking exercise transition,

indicating a faster aerobic system adjustment to supply the energetic demand. Women also 
presented a remarkably faster �� extraction dynamics in comparison to men at both peripheral 
and pulmonary compartments. The observed faster aerobic system adjustment in women during 
treadmill walking at a submaximal intensity was a consequence of faster intracellular �� 
handling in combination with faster central �� delivery.
