Malaria parasites of the genus Plasmodium are diverse in mammal hosts, infecting five mammalian orders in the Old
World, but were long considered absent from the diverse deer family (Cervidae) and from New World mammals.
There was a description of a Plasmodium parasite infecting a single splenectomized white-tailed deer (WTD; Odocoileus
virginianus) in 1967 but none have been reported since, which has proven a challenge to our understanding of malaria
parasite biogeography. Using both microscopy and polymerase chain reaction, we screened a large sample of native
and captive ungulate species from across the United States for malaria parasites. We found a surprisingly high prevalence
(up to 25%) and extremely low parasitemia of Plasmodium parasites in WTD throughout the eastern United States. We
did not detect infections in the other ungulate species nor in western WTD. We also isolated the parasites from the
mosquito Anopheles punctipennis. Morphologically, the parasites resemble the parasite described in 1967, Plasmodium
odocoilei. Our analysis of the cytochrome b gene revealed two divergent Plasmodium clades in WTD representative of
species that likely diverged 2.3 to 6 million years ago, concurrent with the arrival of the WTD ancestor into North
America across Beringia. Multigene phylogenetic analysis placed these clades within the larger malaria parasite clade.
We document Plasmodium parasites to be common in WTD, endemic to the New World, and as the only known
malaria parasites from deer (Cervidae). These findings reshape our knowledge of the phylogeography of the malaria
parasites and suggest that other mammal taxa may harbor infection by endemic and occult malaria parasites.
INTRODUCTION
Malaria parasites exploit a diverse array of vertebrate hosts (squamate
reptiles, birds, and mammals) and dipteran insect vectors (mosquitoes,
midges, black flies, among many others) from every terrestrial habitat
and every continent except Antarctica (1). The Plasmodium species of
avian hosts have been described from most bird orders and families and
are geographically cosmopolitan with some species even reaching oceanic
islands and displaying a worldwide distribution (2). The Plasmodium
species that infect lizards are likewise broadly distributed, also occur-
ring on oceanic islands and large isolated landmasses such as New
Zealand (3). Birds are highly mobile and thus can carry parasites over
the continents, whereas the distribution of Plasmodium in squamate
reptiles may represent repeated lateral transfer between birds and lizards
over their evolutionary history (4). In contrast, the Plasmodium species
of mammals have a more limited distribution, long thought to be
restricted to the Old World where Plasmodium species are known from
five mammal orders, namely, Primates (lemurs, monkeys, and apes, in-
cluding five nominate species in humans), Rodentia (thicket rats, por-
cupines, and flying squirrels), Chiroptera (bats), Dermoptera (colugos),
and Artiodactyla [mouse deer (Tragulidae), antelope, and Asian water
buffalo (Bovidae)] (3, 5). Surveys showed Plasmodium parasites to be
absent in the diverse deer family Cervidae, which is one of the largest and
most widely distributed mammalian families. In addition, no endemic
Plasmodium parasite was known from any mammal in the New World.
Two species of Plasmodium described from numerous species of South
American monkeys are now known to be lateral transfers of two human
parasites, Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium malariae, probably since
European contact (6). Thus, Plasmodium parasites have been described
from diverse mammal taxa and over a large geographic range including
Africa, mainland Asia, and the large islands of Southeast Asia, but not
from the New World.
These perplexing patterns, the apparent absence of Plasmodium
parasites from mammals in the New World and their absence from the
diverse deer family, were challenged by the 1967 report of a new
malaria parasite, later described in 1980 as Plasmodium odocoilei, from
a single white-tailed deer (WTD) Odocoileus virginianus, from Texas,
USA (7). This animal had been splenectomized in an attempt to reveal
occult or hidden infections, and even then, prevalence within the blood
of the new parasite was extremely low (one parasite per 30,000 red
blood cells) (8). Only a single blood smear from the infection was pre-
served with this smear now deposited at the Natural History Museum
in London, UK (9). Despite many studies of blood parasites of WTD,

 a common big game species in North America, over the past half century,
P. odocoilei has not been observed again (8, 10, 11). Many spurious re-
ports of Plasmodium species have entered the parasitological literature,
so the WTD parasite may well have been misidentified. However, the
illustrations in the species description resemble Plasmodium, including
the presence of both multinucleated schizont stages and hemozoin
pigment, and one author, P. C. C. Garnham, was one of the field’s em-
inent scholars and would have been unlikely to misidentify the parasite.
During a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)–based survey for the
vectors of avian malaria parasites at the Smithsonian’s National Zoological
Park (NZP), we recovered an enigmatic malaria parasite sequence. By
phylogenetic analysis of the parasite’s cytochrome b gene (cytb), this
sequence placed within the overall Plasmodium clade but was divergent
from other sequenced Plasmodium taxa. WTD was identified as the
blood meal source by analysis of the vertebrate DNA (cytb) isolated
from the blood meal of one of the Plasmodium-positive mosquitoes.
This finding led us to conduct a major survey of WTD and other wild
native and zoo ungulate species from across the United States and to
investigate the possible origins of malaria parasites in New World
mammals. We report the rediscovery of Plasmodium parasites in WTD
and further find that these malaria parasites, which have remained hidden
for so long in North America’s most popular game species, the WTD, are
common, diverse, and endemic.
RESULTS
Vector and vertebrate host sampling
A total of 1978 individual mosquitoes of 27 species were sampled at two
sites, NZP, Washington, DC, and San Diego County, CA (Fig. 1 and
table S1). Salivary glands were dissected out of each mosquito and
screened by nested PCR for Plasmodium infection using primers that
target a fragment of the cytb gene on the parasite’s mitochondrial genome
(4). A phylogenetic analysis of the sequences obtained from the salivary
glands of Anopheles punctipennis (2 of 35, prevalence of 5%) placed the
parasite within the overall Plasmodium clade but not close to other se-
quenced mammalian Plasmodium taxa. All other parasite sequences re-
trieved from mosquito salivary glands placed within the avian Plasmodium
clade. WTD was identified as the blood meal source from the blood meal
of one of the Plasmodium-positive A. punctipennis. This native mosquito

 species occurs in more mesic habitats throughout North America, taking
blood meals from large mammals (12), and historically was a vector of
introduced human malaria parasites in North America (13).
We surveyed WTD across their range as well as two other native
cervid species that overlap with the range of the WTD, the mule deer
(Odocoileus hemionus, the closest sister taxon to WTD) and elk (Cervus
canadensis). We also sampled pronghorn (Antilocapra americana), a
distant artiodactylid relative of deer, from parts of their range that
overlapwithWTD(Fig.1andtableS2).BecausetheWTDparasitecould
have been acquired from an exotic or domestic host, nine captive species
of ungulates from NZP campuses in Washington, DC, and Front Royal,
VA, were screened for Plasmodium (table S3). All host species were
screened for Plasmodium infection by nested PCR of blood or tissue
samples. Microscopic examination of blood smears was then carried
out for a subset of the samples for confirmation of infection and visu-
alization of parasite morphology.
Parasite screening
The nested PCR-based screening of 308 WTD from 17 states found 41
infected animals from 17 counties throughout 10 states in the eastern
and southern United States (Fig. 1 and table S2). Overall prevalence
at the Plasmodium-positive sites was 18% but reached approximately
25% at sites in Virginia and West Virginia. None of the other sampled
native ungulate species (a total of 151 individuals of three species) or
exotic or domestic ungulate species (39 individuals of nine species) were
found to harbor Plasmodium infection (tables S2 and S3). A total of
four animals produced double-nucleotide peaks on sequence electro-
pherograms indicative of mixed infections (14, 15). Ambiguities were
only present at one or two nucleotide positions, and each of these mixed
infections could be unequivocally assigned to single parasite infections
present in other infected WTD.
Examination of blood smears from infected WTD revealed par-
asites that were diagnosed as Plasmodium by morphology including
the diagnostic characters of hemozoin pigment and asexual reproduc-
tion in blood cells, and these WTD parasites closely matched the illustra-
tions in the original species description of P. odocoilei (8). Examination
of the original type smear [loaned from the Natural History Museum,
London, UK (specimen number 742 H of the Garnham collection)] found
parasites with similar morphology to those from the newly sampled
WTD (Fig. 2), including grossly enlarged infected red blood cells, localized
pigment, spiked projections of the gametocytes, and conspicuous vacuoles.
When compared to other described mammalian Plasmodium species,
the morphology of the WTD parasite was most similar to Plasmodium
cephalophi of the grey duiker (Sylvicapra grimmia), an African ante-
lope (3). No blood samples had been stored from the species descrip-
tion, and the original blood smear could not be destructively sampled
for molecular analysis.
Molecular analyses
To determine where the WTD parasites place within a broad phylogeny,
four genes from the parasites’ three genomes were amplified and se-
quenced using primers specific for haemosporidian parasites: cytb and
cytochrome oxidase I (coI) from the mitochondrial genome, adenylo-
succinate lyase (asl) from the nuclear genome, and caseinolytic protease
(clpC) from the plastid genome (4). Haemosporidians, like most par-
asites from the phylum Apicomplexa, carry a unique organelle, the
apicoplast, with its own genome. Bayesian phylogenetic analyses placed
the WTD parasites not closely related to Plasmodium of other mam-
mal hosts but rather as sister to Polychromophilus parasites of bats
from Eurasia and Africa (Fig. 3). The genus Plasmodium was recov-
ered as polyphyletic in the resulting topology with parasites identified
to this genus recovered in three separate clades: P. odocoilei and Poly-
chromophilus, the Plasmodium species of avian and squamate hosts plus
Nycteria parasites of Old World bats, and a paraphyletic clade of primate
and rodent Plasmodium species plus Hepatocystis parasites of Old World
bats (Fig. 3). Thus, the clade of Plasmodium parasites of WTD in North
America place most closely related to malaria parasites of Old World bats.
The cytb gene is often used in studies of species-level diversity of
malaria parasites, and a phylogenetic analysis of sequence data from this
gene revealed a number of parasite haplotypes isolated from WTD (Fig. 4)
(16). Two main clades representative of species differed by 3% of 614
base pairs (bp). Individual phylogenetic analysis of each of the other
three genes individually (coI, clpC, and asl) also corroborate reproduc-
tive isolation of these two main clades and their status as distinct spe-
cies. Using two independent molecular clock estimates for divergence
at the mitochondrial cytb gene for malaria parasites (17, 18), we found
that these two clades likely diverged between 2.3 and 6 million years
ago (Ma). A recent study evaluating divergence times for mammalian
Plasmodium taxa based on analysis of thousands of nuclear genes (19)
confirms mitochondrial time estimates for very recent divergences,
which would include those estimated for the two WTD Plasmodium
species in our study. The ancestor of the WTD is estimated to have
traveled across the Bering Land Bridge into North America in the
Miocene 4.2 to 5.7 Ma (20). Diversity of cytb haplotypes within one

 Plasmodium clade (clade 2; Fig. 4) is about 0.5%, estimated with an
origin at 0.4 to 1.0 Ma.
DISCUSSION
We found Plasmodium parasites that are widespread and locally com-
mon in WTD, the iconic large game animal of North America. This con-
clusion is supported by both microscopy of parasite morphology and
phylogenetic analysis of gene sequence data. We also isolated Plasmodium
DNA from the salivary glands of A. punctipennis, suggesting that this
mosquito species is the vector host of the WTD parasites. The parasites
clearly concord with the morphology and life history characters that
diagnose the genus Plasmodium including vertebrate and dipteran hosts,
asexual replication in the blood cells by schizogony, production of male
and female gametocytes in the blood cells, and visible hemozoin pig-
ment within the schizonts (meronts) and gametocytes. The parasite
matches the morphology of P. odocoilei described five decades ago from
a single animal but not observed since. Furthermore, phylogenetic anal-
ysis of genes from all three genomes of the parasites placed the WTD
parasites within the overall Plasmodium clade. Together, our micros-
copy and molecular results of both vertebrate and vector hosts corrob-
orate the rediscovery of malaria parasites from the WTD in North
America. The malaria parasites, which we regard as the P. odocoilei
species group, are confirmed as the only known endemic Plasmodium
of a New World mammal and the only Plasmodium known from a deer.
The presence of multiple Plasmodium clades in the WTD argues
for a long evolutionary history of Plasmodium parasites and their
WTD hosts extending back, perhaps, to the origin of WTD in North
America. A few lines of evidence support the passage of these WTD
parasites over the Bering Land Bridge within the ancestor of WTD
rather than host shifts into WTD from introduced ungulates such as
captive animals in zoos. First, at least two likely species of Plasmodium

 parasites were isolated from WTD (based on their genetic divergence),
and these parasites are closely related. Within one of the WTD clades
(lineage 2; Fig. 4), we found additional variation (up to 0.5%) that may be
indicative of substantial intraspecific variation. The application of
multiple independent molecular clock estimates for the malaria
parasites (17–19) supports the divergence of these parasite clades to
be roughly concordant with the passage of the WTD ancestor through
Beringia. In addition, we failed to detect parasite DNA in a sample
of nonnative ungulate species in the United States, including domestic
species and species housed in collections at zoological parks. Plasmodi-
um parasites have been described from the Asian mouse deer (Tragu-
lidae) and the antelope and Asian water buffalo (Bovidae) in Africa, all
of which have been introduced into the New World, but it is unlikely
that parasites from these species would jump numerous times into
deer and thus into a new host family (Cervidae) (8). Clearly, more re-
search including sampling of Old World ungulate hosts, both native
and introduced, and genetic characterization of their Plasmodium
parasites are needed to further support or refute hypotheses on the
origin of malaria parasites in New World deer. If the parasites did in-
deed travel over the Bering Land Bridge with a herd of ancestral North
American deer, it suggests that suitable temperatures existed in the high
arctic for successful transmission of Plasmodium parasites by Anopheline
mosquitoes. This potential scenario highlights the importance of the
Bering Land Bridge and interglacial periods in the passage of vector-
borne pathogens into the New World.
WTD may have carried multiple parasite lineages from their an-
cestor population during the migration across Beringia (20), or Pleis-
tocene glaciations forced WTD into ice-free refugia, as in the mule deer
O. hemionus (21, 22), leading to the diversification of both the WTD
and parasites. WTD were nearly extirpated throughout much of the
eastern and southern portions of their range due to overhunting, exploi-
tation, and other causes, with reintroductions into these areas in the
1920s to the 1970s (23). Thus, it is likely that any biogeographic signals
of the parasites would have been lost. In summary, the absence of
parasites in the exotic host species we sampled and the finding of
multiple closely related Plasmodium lineages within the WTD support
the endemic nature of these WTD malaria parasites in North America.
Our results beg the question of why diverse malaria parasites that are
specialized to WTD remained cryptic in a large game mammal that has
long been the center of study for wildlife biologists and managers.
Most likely, the answer is the occult nature of all of the infections ob-
served for P. odocoilei, with extremely low parasite density (an esti-
mated ~1/65,000 red blood cells infected). This is not unusual for the
Plasmodium infecting mammals including the malaria parasites of humans.
Examples include P. cephalophi and Plasmodium brucei in the common
duiker (S. grimmia), an African antelope, Plasmodium traguli from the
chevrotain (Tragulus javanicus) of Southeast Asia, Plasmodium inui in
Asian macaque monkeys, and Plasmodium girardi in lemurs (3). Some
of these species were discovered only from hosts that had been splenec-
tomized as an experimental method to reveal low-level blood infections.
Very-low-level infections, although not as extreme, are also common in
many avian malaria parasites (2, 24). This life history trait, of producing
few parasites in the blood of the vertebrate host, is clearly sufficient for the
successfultransfertotheinsect host andshowsthatthegametesproduced
by the parasite are able to find what are likely rare mates in the vector
blood meal. When feeding, Anopheles take approximately 3 ml of blood,
and WTD blood contains approximately 8 × 106 erythrocytes/ml; a blood
meal would therefore contain hundreds of parasite cells, even for such
occult infections (25, 26). Together, these findings suggest that for some
speciesofPlasmodium,low-levelinfectionsare successfulintransmission.

 Our findings highlight the importance of molecular methods in
parasite discovery. Through the application of sensitive PCR-based
screening, we detected low parasitemia infections in WTD previously
undetected under the light microscope for a half century. Phylogenetic
methods also allowed for the identification of multiple cryptic Plasmodium
species in WTD. The discovery of Plasmodium parasites that are common
and widespread in such a well-studied game species as the WTD, yet not
recognized for so long, argues that other malaria parasites of mammals
are yet to be discovered, perhaps in surprising host species within plain
sight. The coupling of light microscopy and molecular methods and
increased surveillance for mammalian Plasmodium parasites promises
to further expand our knowledge of the systematic diversity and phylo-
geography of the malaria parasites.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Experimental design
The main objectives of our study were to examine the distribution of
the Plasmodium parasites of New World mammals including their
vector and vertebrate hosts, geographic range, and possible origin in the
New World. We sampled hundreds of vertebrate hosts from across the
continental United States, including both wild and native ungulate species
aswellasnonnativeanddomesticungulatespecies.Sampleswerescreened
by PCR, which allowed for detection of low-level infections, and addition-
ally by microscopy for the WTD samples, which allowed for visualization
of the parasites and confirmation of development in the vertebrate host.
Thousands of mosquitoes were screened by PCR for malaria parasites as
well. Analysis of sequence data from the parasites then allowed us to in-
vestigate the diversity of parasites, their phylogenetic relationships with
other malaria parasites, and to estimate divergence dates.
Sampling of vertebrate hosts
WTD samples were obtained during necropsy of dead animals, health
assessments, or other research purposes by the Smithsonian Conser-
vation Biology Institute, the Southeastern Cooperative Wildlife Disease
Study, and the American Museum of Natural History. We screened a
total of 308 WTD samples from 25 counties in 17 states across the
range of the species in the United States (table S2 and Fig. 1). Elk were
sampled from five counties in three states, mule deer from four
counties in two states, and pronghorn from four counties in one state
(table S2 and Fig. 1). Mule deer, elk, and pronghorn samples were
obtained from areas that overlap with the geographic range of the
WTD. A total of 39 collection animals of nine species were screened
from the NZP campuses in Washington, DC, and Front Royal, VA,
including two antelope species and two deer species (table S3). Samples
screened in this study include spleen and liver tissue and blood col-
lected during the warm months in which biting mosquitoes are active
(May through October). DNA extractions were obtained from heart
and ear tissues for the Connecticut and New York samples. All sampling
methods were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee.
As part of other research studies, WTD were live caught at the Front
Royal Campus of the NZP, which enabled zoo veterinary staff the op-
portunity to prepare blood smears from the animals in addition to blood
collection for PCR screening. Blood was collected from the jugular vein
into heparinized syringes, and thin blood smears were immediately pre-
pared in the field. Blood smears were then fixed in methanol, stained with
Giemsa, and examined for blood parasites under ×100 magnification.
Sampling of invertebrate hosts
Mosquitoes were sampled at the NZP in Washington, DC, from mid
April through late October and from sites throughout San Diego
County in California in April and May using Centers for Disease Con-
trol (CDC) miniature light traps baited with CO2 and gravid traps
baited with rabbit pellet–infused water. Male mosquitoes were dis-
carded, while blood-fed, unfed, and gravid females were separated
from each other. Approximately 20% of gravid females from each mos-
quito species and all blood-fed individuals were then screened for ma-
laria parasite infection by nested PCR (table S1). Mosquitoes were
determined to be gravid by dissection of ovaries under the dissection
scope and visual inspection of ovaries on glass microscope slides under
the light microscope at 10×. All blood-fed and selected parous mosqui-
toes were identified to species based on morphology with further dif-
ferentiation of Culex species carried out by PCR for infected individuals
(27). The salivary glands of each mosquito were then carefully extracted
under a dissection scope using sterile instruments, and DNA was
extracted using the Qiagen BioSprint 96 System following the manufac-
turer’s guidelines. The abdomen from each blood-fed individual was
removed using sterile instruments and transferred to a microcentrifuge
tube with buffer ATL where it was agitated with a sterile plastic pestle
before DNA extraction using the Qiagen BioSprint 96 System following
the manufacturer’s instructions.
Parasite screening and phylogenetic analysis
DNA was extracted from blood or tissues using a Qiagen DNeasy Blood
and Tissue Kit or the Qiagen BioSprint 96 System following the man-
ufacturer’s guidelines. A 614-bp fragment of the cytb gene in malaria
parasites was amplified by nested PCR using the conserved primers
DW2/DW4 followed by DW1/DW3 (28). Negative controls were in-
cluded for each round of PCRs, and no contamination was detected.
PCR products were visualized by gel electrophoresis, purified using
ExoSAP-IT (Affymetrix), and cycle-sequenced using BigDye Termina-
tor v3.1, and the sequencing products were cleaned with Sephadex G-50
columns and then sequenced on an ABI 3130xl Sequencer. Sequences
were edited and aligned using Sequencher version 5.0 (Gene Codes).
Using Geneious, maximum likelihood methods were used to reconstruct
a phylogeny and estimate nodal support values for the cytb data set.
For the four-gene phylogeny reconstruction, DNA from four genes
across three genomes was amplified and sequenced, including cytb
and coI from the mitochondrial genome, clpC from the plastid genome,
and asl from the nuclear genome (4). All sequences were edited and
aligned by eye using Sequencher v5.0. BEAST v1.8.0 (29) was used to
generate a Bayesian tree and posterior probability values. Mitochon-
drial (cytb and coxI) data were partitioned into first plus second and
third codon positions, where clpC and asl data were not, as determined
by PartitionFinder (30). A GTR + I + G model was selected with equal
nucleotide frequencies and estimated substitution rate matrix. The
starting tree topology was obtained via the graphical user interface im-
plementation of RAxML (31), and a Yule speciation process was ap-
plied. An uncorrelated relaxed clock (32) was used, and a Markov
chain Monte Carlo with chain length of 50,000,000 was run. The first
25% of trees were discarded as burn-in, and the tree was summarized
with TreeAnnotator (33).
Extraction products from the blooded mosquito abdomens were
used to amplify a short fragment of the vertebrate cytb gene using prim-
ers SteeriF1/SteeriR1 (34). PCR products were visualized on agarose
gels, cleaned using ExoSAP-IT, and sequenced as described above.
