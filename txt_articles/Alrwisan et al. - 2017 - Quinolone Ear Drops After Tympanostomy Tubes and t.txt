Background. This study investigated whether quinolone ear drops, with or without corticosteroids, increase the risk of perfora-
tion requiring tympanoplasty following tympanostomy tube (TT) placement in children.
Methods. This was a retrospective cohort study using Medicaid encounter and pharmacy billing data from 29 US states between 
1999 and 2006. Children <18 years old without predisposing factors for perforation during a 6-month look-back period entered the 
cohort after TT placement and first dispensing of antibiotic ear drops. Included ear drops were quinolones (ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin 
plus hydrocortisone, or ciprofloxacin plus dexamethasone) or neomycin plus hydrocortisone. Children were followed until end of 
2006, end of Medicaid enrollment, or occurrence of study outcome. A Cox regression model, adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, 
initial TT indication, reinsertion of TT, adenoidectomy, and number of ear drop prescriptions was used to compare the rate of per-
foration between quinolone and neomycin plus hydrocortisone ear drop–exposed children. Perforation was defined by its diagnosis 
code followed by a tympanoplasty code.
Results. A total of 96 595 children entered the study cohort. Patients exposed to quinolone ear drops had a higher risk of per-
foration, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.61 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.15–2.26). The adjusted hazard ratios were 1.49 (95% 
CI, 1.05–2.09) for ofloxacin, 1.94 (95% CI, 1.32–2.85) for ciprofloxacin plus hydrocortisone, and 2.00 (95% CI, 1.18–3.41) for cipro-
floxacin plus dexamethasone.
Conclusions. Exposure of children with TT to quinolone ear drops is associated with increased risk of perforations requiring 
tympanoplasty, which appears to be further exaggerated by corticosteroids. Clinicians should consider the risk of perforation and 
counsel patients/families accordingly when prescribing quinolone ear drops.

Tympanostomy tube (TT) placement is the most commonly 
performed ambulatory surgery in children [1]. Serious com-
plications related to TTs, such as tympanic membrane perfo-
rations (TMPs), have historically been considered uncommon, 
on the order of 2% [2]; however, recent studies have reported 
post-TT TMP rates in excess of 10% [3]. Most patients with 
TTs suffer from at least 1 bout of otorrhea [4], which has also 
been associated with post-TT TMP [3]. Antibiotic ear drops 
are recommended for post-TT otorrhea [5], with preference for 
quinolones over aminoglycosides [6], in large part because of 
the potential for ototoxicity with aminoglycosides [7, 8].
Systemic use of quinolones has been linked to detrimen-
tal effects on collagenous tissue in humans [9]. Following 
several observational studies [10, 11], the US Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) requested a class labeling change for oral 
quinolones to include a black box warning about the risk of ten-
don rupture in 2008 [12]. In 2015, the FDA convened an advi-
sory committee meeting to review new safety concerns with 
oral fluoroquinolones. The committee concluded an unfavora-
ble risk-benefit for their use in acute sinusitis, uncomplicated 
urinary tract infections, and acute exacerbations of chronic 
bronchitis and recommended that topical fluoroquinolone 
preparations should be reviewed as well [13].
Quinolone ear drops have not been linked to post-TT TMP, 
but clinical trials have been limited by small sample size and 
short follow-up periods [14, 15]. Animal studies on quinolone 
ear drops have focused on the effects of combined corticoster-
oids on healing of the perforated eardrum (tympanic mem-
brane [TM]) and ignored the potential impact of quinolones 
[16]. A recent cell culture study showed that treatment of TM 
fibroblasts with ciprofloxacin, at concentrations similar to those 
achieved with ear drops in humans, led to marked cytotoxic-
ity and depression in collagen synthesis, which is necessary for

the TM healing process [17]. The eye, especially the cornea, is 
similarly frequently treated with ophthalmic quinolones [18]. 
Quinolone preparations have been reported to have toxic effects 
on corneal cells in vitro [19], in vivo [20], and in clinical trials 
[21]. Given the widespread use of otic quinolones following TT 
placement and the known association between TT placement 
and TMP [2], we sought to investigate whether otic quinolones 
would increase the risk of TMP compared to otic neomycin plus 
hydrocortisone preparations.
METHODS
Data Source and Cohort Set-up
This retrospective cohort study was conducted using Medicaid 
Analytical eXtract (MAX) files made available for research by 
the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). MAX 
includes billing data for inpatient and outpatient encounters 
with detail on diagnoses and procedures as well as pharmacy 
dispensing claims. MAX data are extensively used for drug 
safety and effectiveness research and are particularly valuable 
for pediatrics, with approximately 50% of US children enrolled 
in Medicaid [22].
We included patients aged 18 years or younger and eligible 
for Medicaid fee-for-service benefits in 29 US states between 
1999 and 2006 (detail on states is available in Supplementary 
Appendix A). This study time period was used to maximize 
exposure to neomycin, as preferences for antibiotic ear drops 
have shifted heavily toward quinolone preparations in recent 
years [6]. Children entered the cohort at the first dispensing 
of either quinolone or neomycin ear drops following their first 
TT placement, which was identified from inpatient or outpa-
tient encounter records with Current Procedural Terminology 
(CPT) code 69433 or 69436. All patients had to have at least 
6 months continuous eligibility for Medicaid services prior 
to TT surgery and throughout the first ear drop dispensing, 
which had to occur within 12 months after TT placement. This 
time period was chosen because TTs extrude and the TM com-
monly heals between 12 and 18 months after insertion [23]. 
This study focused on the effect of quinolones on this healing 
process.
We excluded patients with conditions that might predis-
pose to TMP or other TM pathology requiring surgery, based 
on inpatient or outpatient encounter diagnoses within the 
6-month look-back period prior to TT insertion and through-
out follow-up. These conditions included cholesteatoma, 
human immunodeficiency virus, severe combined immunode-
ficiency, organ transplant, cancer, craniofacial anomalies, cleft 
palate, burns, ear trauma, failure to thrive, cachexia, exposure 
to chemotherapeutic agents, head and neck radiation, and >2 
weeks of systemic steroid exposure. Patients with the study 
outcome 6 months prior to cohort entry were also excluded. 
Definitions of excluded conditions are in Supplementary 
Table 1.
Study Outcome
We defined persistent TMP as an inpatient or outpatient encoun-
ter associated with TMP (International Classification of Diseases, 
Ninth Revision [ICD-9] codes 384.20, 384.21, or 384.23–384.25) 
followed by a tympanoplasty (CPT codes 69631–69633, 69635–
69637, or 69641–69646). Tympanoplasty is routinely delayed 
until children are older to improve the likelihood of success 
[24]. Though we knew the requirement for surgical TM repair 
would severely underestimate the true incidence of TMP in 
children who received TTs, we elected to use this more restric-
tive definition to maximize specificity for detecting permanent 
perforation. To preclude reverse causation, where the plan for 
tympanoplasty resulted in otic antibiotic initiation to eliminate 
ear infections prior to surgery, we excluded cases of perforation 
occurring within 30 days after the cohort entry date.
Exposure
We considered neomycin plus hydrocortisone as active com-
parator because neomycin has no known adverse effects on 
collagen tissues and it has historically been used following TT 
placement [6]. In a previous study, we found that neomycin 
and quinolone ear drops accounted for nearly all of the oto-
topical agents prescribed to children with TTs [6], effectively 
limiting our study to these 2 categories. Quinolone prepara-
tions included in this study were ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin plus 
hydrocortisone, and ciprofloxacin plus dexamethasone. Ear 
drops containing ofloxacin with a steroid and ciprofloxacin 
without a steroid were not commercially available during the 
study period and could therefore not be evaluated. Based on 
the first pharmacy dispensing record, patients were classified as 
either quinolone or neomycin plus hydrocortisone users. When 
a patient in either of the study groups was later prescribed a 
consecutive otic antibiotic other than the initial one, then fol-
low-up was terminated at this point. This was done because 
effects on collagenous tissue may be irreversible and decisions 
to undergo tympanoplasty may be delayed, especially in young 
children. Accordingly, patients were followed after initial otic 
antibiotic use until a switch to different ear drops, end of 2006, 
end of Medicaid enrollment, or occurrence of the study out-
come, whichever occurred first.
Covariates
We considered patient sex, race, the calendar year at study entry, 
and diagnoses at the time of TT placement as fixed covariates. 
In addition, we adjusted for TT reinsertion, adenoidectomy, 
and number of ear drop prescriptions as time-varying covar-
iates during follow-up (covariate definitions are available in 
Supplementary Table 2). We noted a difference in timing of ear 
drops relative to TT insertion, especially in more recent study 
years where quinolones were used earlier than neomycin. We 
interpreted this as potential confounding by severity, where 
quinolones were increasingly used for more minor effusion at TT

insertion, whereas neomycin ear drops were more often initiated 
when otorrhea or otitis media developed during follow-up. To 
account for this difference, we also adjusted the analysis for the 
time difference between TT placement and ear drop initiation.
Statistical Analysis
We used a time-dependent Cox regression model to estimate 
the unadjusted and adjusted hazards ratios (HRs) of TMP 
comparing exposure to quinolones and neomycin plus hydro-
cortisone. We further examined the association between differ-
ent quinolone-containing ear drop formulations to neomycin 
plus hydrocortisone using a categorical exposure variable that 
identified the initial antibiotic dispensation as neomycin plus 
hydrocortisone, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin plus hydrocortisone, 
or ciprofloxacin plus dexamethasone.
To challenge the study assumptions, we conducted 2 sensi-
tivity analyses. First, we did not exclude cases of tympanoplasty 
occurring within 30 days of the first antibiotic exposure. Second, 
we allowed patients to switch between exposure groups and ear 
drops were modeled as time-varying exposure with cases attrib-
uted to the last exposure. SAS software version 9.4 (SAS Institute, 
Cary, North Carolina) was used for data management and ana-
lysis. All tests were 2-sided, with an α level of .05 indicating statis-
tical significance. The study protocol was approved by the CMS 
and our center’s institutional review and privacy boards.
RESULTS
We identified 300 173 children with encounter claims for TT 
procedures. After applying the exclusion and inclusion criteria, 
the number of patients included in the cohort was 96 595. Of 
these, 78 275 were exposed to quinolones; the remainder were 
neomycin plus hydrocortisone–exposed children (Figure 1). 
Children who were started on otic neomycin were slightly older. 
All other baseline characteristics showed <1 percentage point 
differences between groups (Table 1).
The distribution between children initiated on otic neomycin 
or quinolone was similar at the beginning of the study period 
but changed rapidly to predominant use of quinolones in later 
study years (Table 2). Of note, the proportion of children who 
had ear drops dispensed at the same day as tube placement 
increased steadily among the quinolone users from 18% to 
58%, whereas it remained steady for neomycin users at about 
one-quarter.
A total of 364 TMPs occurred during follow-up, resulting in 
an incidence rate of 11 TMPs/10 000 patient-years for neomy-
cin plus hydrocortisone–exposed children and 17 TMPs/10 000 
patient-years for children with exposure to otic quinolone. The 
unadjusted HR for TMP for patients who were exposed to any 
otic quinolone preparation compared with children exposed to 
neomycin was 1.44 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04–2.00). 
When we adjusted for demographics and other covariates, the 
HR was 1.61 (95% CI, 1.15–2.26; Table 3). Each year increase in 
patients’ age was associated with a 21% increase in the hazard 
of TMPs (95% CI, 18%–24%). An increased frequency of ear 
drop prescriptions was also associated with higher risk of TMPs 
(HR, 1.14 [95% CI, 1.11–1.17]). Comparisons of ofloxacin,

ciprofloxacin plus hydrocortisone, and ciprofloxacin plus dex-
amethasone against neomycin plus hydrocortisone showed an 
increased hazard for each individual quinolone preparation 
(HRs, 1.49 [95% CI, 1.05–2.09]; 1.94 [95% CI, 1.32–2.85]; and 
2.00 [95% CI 1.18–3.41], respectively, Table 4). The sensitiv-
ity analyses yielded results comparable to the main analysis 
(Supplementary Tables 3 and 4).
DISCUSSION
The literature is replete with studies documenting the deleterious 
effects of quinolones on soft tissues [16, 25, 26]. Implicated mech-
anisms include increased apoptosis of extracellular matrix–pro-
ducing cells [27], increased degradation of extracellular matrix via 
enhanced matrix metalloproteinase activity [28], and decreased 
levels of intact collagen [29]. The structural integrity of the TM is 
derived from its middle layer (lamina propria), which is composed 
largely of fibroblasts and collagen [30]. As the concentrations of 
quinolones in otic preparations—what is reaching the TM—can 
be roughly 1000 times the plasma concentrations achieved with 
oral administration [31], the soft tissue toxicity of quinolones 
would be expected to manifest in the quinolone-exposed TM. In 
cell culture, TM fibroblasts have shown increased cytotoxicity and 
markedly lower levels of collagen after quinolone exposure [17]. 
Consistent with the suggested mechanisms, our findings indicate 
an increased risk of TMPs associated with otic quinolone use after 
TT placement in children.
Choice of the appropriate comparator was an important con-
sideration in this study. TMPs are known complications of both 
otitis media [32] and TT placement [2]. Post-TT otitis media, 
the primary indication for otic antibiotics, therefore, acts as 
confounder and precludes comparisons to patients without any 
treatment. Post-TT otitis media can be treated with oral antibi-
otics [33], but cure rates are less favorable [14]. Furthermore, 
oral antibiotics may be given for a myriad of indications, unre-
lated to the ear. Thus, given similar indications and efficacy pro-
files, and in absence of effective ear drops that contain neither 
quinolones nor steroids, our chosen neomycin plus hydrocor-
tisone comparator established the most balanced comparison 
groups.
The neomycin ear drops used as the reference agent in our 
study have been associated with TM pathology [34], which 
has been linked to an excipient, propylene glycol [35]. These 
neomycin ear drops also contain hydrocortisone, which may 
independently increase the risk for TMPs. For example, experi-
mental studies have reported delayed healing of TMs after 
myringotomy and topical treatment with hydrocortisone [36] 
and spontaneous TMPs following acute otitis externa treatment 
with neomycin plus hydrocortisone [37]. Thus, the probability 
for a slightly elevated risk of TMP in our reference group should 
be considered when interpreting the relative increase in risk 
attributed to otic quinolones.
Unfortunately, comparison of different quinolone formu-
lations was compromised by small sample size. Furthermore, 
because preparations containing ofloxacin with a steroid 
and ciprofloxacin without a steroid were not commercially

 1056 • CID 2017:64 (15 April) • Alrwisan et al 
available during the study period, we could not address 2 clin-
ically important questions. First, does the addition of steroids 
to quinolones increase the risk for TMP? Synergistic effects of 
steroid/quinolone combinations have been described by others, 
including an increased risk of tendon rupture associated with 
concomitant use of systemic corticosteroids and quinolones 
[10]. Second, is the quinolone effect drug-specific or a class phe-
nomenon? We did find independent effects of each quinolone 
preparation, but were unable to discern whether the magnitude 
of effect differs across agents. Our in vitro experiments with TM 
fibroblasts suggest more pronounced effects of ciprofloxacin 
compared with ofloxacin [38].
We chose a study period of the last decade when otic neo-
mycin was commonly used to treat post-TT otitis media [6]. 
Addition of more recent years would have included an era 
when clinical guidelines started to discourage use of neomy-
cin in children with non-intact TM [7], resulting in limited use 
and yielding it an inadequate comparator. Because preferences 
changed over the study period, we adjusted for study year to 
ensure comparisons were not confounded by other secular 
changes. We did note increasing use of otic quinolones (but 
not neomycin) at the time of tube placement, which was likely 
triggered by lesser pathology (such as middle ear effusion) than 
therapeutic use for otitis media later during follow-up. Because 
the predominant initiation time of neomycin remained con-
sistently several weeks after TT placement, suggesting more 
frequent use when complications manifested, we adjusted our 
comparison for the difference between initiation time and TT 
placement. As expected, hazard ratios for quinolone exposure 
increased after adjustment, indicating a bias in favor of quinolo-
nes because they were likely used more frequently in absence of 
major complications.
Unlike many drug safety concerns where the adverse effect 
follows exposure immediately, this study was challenged by the 
delay in diagnosis and treatment of tympanic perforation. The 
requirement of tympanoplasty in the definition of TMP focused 
our assessment on cases that were deemed to require surgical 
repair and reduced bias from the use of potentially unreliable 
ICD-9-CM codes. Guidelines recommend that tympanoplasty 
should not be performed for at least 1 year after TMP identifi-
cation to allow spontaneous healing [5]. Therefore, unlike most 
clinical trials, we followed patients for an extended time, which 
was necessary to identify the delayed effects of quinolones. This 
“extended” follow-up—relative to clinical trials of quinolone 
ear drops—will still likely be insufficient to fully demonstrate 
the rate of TMP based on requirement for tympanoplasty. 
Tympanoplasty is often delayed beyond 1 year, as younger 
children are thought to have a lower surgical success rate [24]. 
These factors will underestimate the absolute incidence of 
TMPs in young children using our chosen criteria. The relative 
comparison of incidence rates in the reported HRs would, how-
ever, be unbiased unless the decision to perform tympanoplasty 
differed based on prior antibiotic exposure, and that is highly 
unlikely. Although the study outcome has not been validated, 
using the algorithm of TMP diagnosis code plus charge for tym-
panoplasty has been shown to yield similar rates of permanent 
perforation requiring surgical repair as those reported by pro-
spective studies [39]. Of note, neither procedure codes used to 
identify tympanoplasties nor the ear drop dispensing charges 
are ear specific, which may have resulted in capturing some 
patients whose TMP did not occur in the ear with prior TT 
placement or with ear drop exposure. Bias resulting from expo-
sure misclassification (eg, patients not taking the dispensed ear 
drops) would move the results toward the null hypothesis (ie, 
no difference between quinolone and neomycin treatment) if 
such measurement error was similar between groups.
Lack of randomization in this study comes with concerns 
about residual (ie, unmeasured) confounding. To focus our 
analysis on TMPs following TTs and ear drop exposure, we 
excluded patients with risk factors that may predispose to TMP. 
Review of risk factors that were measured in this study and 
their effect on hazard ratios in multivariate adjustment suggest 
that quinolones were slightly channeled toward children with 
lesser risk, which is likely explained by their increasing use 
right after tube insertion. Risk factors that we were not able 
to account for include the type of TT used, whether the tube 
extruded spontaneously, use of water precautions, and otor-
rhea severity, but these are not expected to differ across com-
parison groups and thus are not expected to create bias. This 
observation is also supported by a previous study in which we 
used similar exposure groups, and found an increased risk for 
sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) associated with neomycin

use [8]. Imbalances related to more severe ear disease would 
need to be differential to explain an increased risk of SNHL for 
neomycin on one hand, and of TMP for quinolone exposure, 
on the other.
Our study raises important questions for further research. 
First, it was confined to children with a TM defect following TT 
placement. Studies evaluating quinolone effects in indication 
with intact TM, such as otitis externa, are needed. Second, while 
most drug safety effects are generalizable across socioeconomic 
classes, the background risk for TMP in children with private 
insurance may be lower than for those enrolled in Medicaid. 
Overall, precise quantification of risk-benefit of otic antibiotic 
use in various indications will greatly enhance evidence-based 
otologic practice. Finally, new quinolone preparations, which 
we were not able to examine within the selected study period, 
should be evaluated to fully understand the contribution of 
each preparation to TMP risk.
Evaluation of the benefits and risks of otic quinolones fol-
lowing TT placement should also consider the safety profile of 
the alternative treatment options, because otic aminoglycoside 
use is associated with SNHL [8]. Unlike a TMP, which can be 
repaired, SNHL is usually irreversible. Ideally, treatment that is 
neither toxic to the inner ear nor damaging to the TM would be 
used. Absent novel treatment options that meet both criteria, an 
important consideration is to avoid overuse of ear drops, which 
has been reported to be a common occurrence [40, 41].
In conclusion, use of quinolone ear drops in children with 
TTs is associated with an increased risk of persistent TMPs. 
Combination with corticosteroids may potentiate the risk for 
persistent TMPs. These risks must be balanced against the risk 
of SNHL with otic aminoglycosides in the presence of a TT.
