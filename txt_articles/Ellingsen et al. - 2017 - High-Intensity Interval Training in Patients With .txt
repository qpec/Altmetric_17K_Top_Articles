ORIGINAL RESEARCH ARTICLE
BACKGROUND: Small studies have suggested that high-intensity interval 
training (HIIT) is superior to moderate continuous training (MCT) in 
reversing cardiac remodeling and increasing aerobic capacity in patients 
with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. The present multicenter 
trial compared 12 weeks of supervised interventions of HIIT, MCT, or a 
recommendation of regular exercise (RRE).
METHODS: Two hundred sixty-one patients with left ventricular ejection 
fraction ≤35% and New York Heart Association class II to III were randomly 
assigned to HIIT at 90% to 95% of maximal heart rate, MCT at 60% to 70% 
of maximal heart rate, or RRE. Thereafter, patients were encouraged to 
continue exercising on their own. Clinical assessments were performed at 
baseline, after the intervention, and at follow-up after 52 weeks. Primary 
end point was a between-group comparison of change in left ventricular 
end-diastolic diameter from baseline to 12 weeks.
RESULTS: Groups did not differ in age (median, 60 years), sex (19% 
women), ischemic pathogenesis (59%), or medication. Change in left 
ventricular end-diastolic diameter from baseline to 12 weeks was not 
different between HIIT and MCT (P=0.45); left ventricular end-diastolic 
diameter changes compared with RRE were −2.8 mm (−5.2 to −0.4 mm; 
P=0.02) in HIIT and −1.2 mm (−3.6 to 1.2 mm; P=0.34) in MCT. There 
was also no difference between HIIT and MCT in peak oxygen uptake 
(P=0.70), but both were superior to RRE. However, none of these changes 
was maintained at follow-up after 52 weeks. Serious adverse events were 
not statistically different during supervised intervention or at follow-up at 52 
weeks (HIIT, 39%; MCT, 25%; RRE, 34%; P=0.16). Training records showed 
that 51% of patients exercised below prescribed target during supervised 
HIIT and 80% above target in MCT.
CONCLUSIONS: HIIT was not superior to MCT in changing left ventricular 
remodeling or aerobic capacity, and its feasibility remains unresolved in 
patients with heart failure.

urrent guidelines recommend exercise training as 
an adjunctive therapy in patients with chronic heart 
failure.1 A universal agreement on exercise prescrip-
tion does not exist; thus, an individualized approach, in-
cluding behavioral characteristics, personal goals, and 
preferences, is recommended.2,3 At present, moderate 
continuous endurance exercise is the best described 
and established form of training because of its well-
demonstrated efficacy and safety.2 This advice is based 
mainly on a large multicenter exercise intervention trial 
(HF-ACTION [Heart Failure: A Controlled Trial Investigat-
ing Outcomes of Exercise Training]) with 2331 patients 
with heart failure, which observed a moderate reduction 
of symptoms, improvement of exercise capacity, and a 
reduction of hospital readmissions for heart failure.4
Exercise of high submaximal intensity performed in 
intervals of 1 to 4 minutes, also called high-intensity in-
terval training (HIIT), has been tested in a small study of 
patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, 
showing that HIIT was superior to moderate continuous 
training (MCT) in improving exercise capacity, quality of 
life, endothelial function, and left ventricular diameter 
and ejection fraction.5 The results were better than those 
observed in previous studies and meta-analyses of pa-
tients with chronic heart failure.6,7 They also prompted 
discussions of whether HIIT should be included in stan-
dard care of patients with chronic heart failure.
This background formed the basis for a larger ran-
domized controlled multicenter trial, the SMARTEX Heart 
Failure Study (Study of Myocardial Recovery After Exer-
cise Training in Heart Failure), to test the hypothesis that 
HIIT is superior to MCT with regard to improvement of 
left ventricular dimensions and exercise capacity.
METHODS
Study Design
The SMARTEX Heart Failure Study is an investigator-initiated 
randomized controlled clinical trial conducted at 9 European 
centers (Antwerp, Copenhagen, Leipzig, Luxembourg, 
Munich, Stavanger, Trondheim/Levanger, Veruno, and 
Ålesund) between June 2009 and July 2014. The final patient 
was randomized July 1, 2013, and had the 52-week follow-up 
on July 22, 2014. The Clinical Trials database registration 
reports 268 patients enrolled in the Web case report form 
database. However, 7 randomizations were error entries dur-
ing initial testing and demonstration of the database. Thus, 
the correct number of patients randomized was 261. The 
trial was approved by the Regional Committee for Medical 
and Health Ethics of Central Norway and by national and local 
committees where required. Informed written consent was 
obtained from all participants. Details of rationale, design, 
methods, sample size, randomization, and organization have 
previously been published.8 Data management and statisti-
cal analyses were performed by the coordinating center with 
oversight by the steering committee (Ø.E., M.H., A.L., E.P.), 
whose members had full access to all data and vouch for the 
accuracy and completeness of data and analyses.
Patients and Interventions
Patients were enrolled from outpatient heart failure clinics, 
referrals to cardiac rehabilitation, public announcements, and 
screening of eligible patients in hospital registries. Eligible 
patients with symptomatic (New York Heart Association class 
II–III), stable, pharmacologically optimally treated chronic 
heart failure were randomized 1:1:1 to a 12-week program 
of HIIT, MCT, or recommendation of regular exercise (RRE), 
stratified by study center and pathogenesis (ischemic versus 
nonischemic). Stratification by center was performed to avoid 
bias from unobserved treatment differences, and stratification 
by pathogenesis was performed to allow possible post hoc 
analysis of the influence on left ventricular end-diastolic diam-
eter (LVEDD) changes. Exercise training protocols have been 
described elsewhere.5,8 Briefly, HIIT and MCT had 3 supervised 
sessions per week on a treadmill or bicycle. HIIT included four 
4-minute intervals aiming at 90% to 95% of maximal heart rate 
separated by 3-minute active recovery periods of moderate 
intensity. HIIT sessions lasted 38 minutes including warm-up 
and cool-down at moderate intensity. MCT sessions aimed at 
60% to 70% of maximal heart rate and lasted 47 minutes. 
HIIT and MCT sessions were estimated to obtain similar energy 
expenditures.9 Patients randomized to RRE were advised to 
exercise at home according to current recommendations and 
attended a session of moderate-intensity training at 50% to 
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• The present multicenter trial did not confirm results 
from a small previous study that indicated that high-
intensity interval training is superior to moderate 
continuous training (MCT) in reversing left ventricu-
lar remodeling and increasing aerobic capacity.
• In both groups, results were only moderately bet-
ter than a recommendation of regular exercise; 
improvements were not maintained at the 52-week 
follow-up.
• Numeric differences in serious adverse events at 52 
weeks suggested a favor of MCT, but the study was 
not powered to compare safety.
• Fifty-one percent of high-intensity interval training 
patients exercised below prescribed heart rate, and 
80% of MCT exercised above their target.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• Given that high-intensity interval training was not 
superior to MCT in reversing remodeling or improv-
ing secondary end points, and considering that 
adherence to the prescribed exercise intensity 
based on heart rate may be difficult to achieve, even 
when supervised and performed in centers experi-
enced in cardiac rehabilitation, MCT remains the 
standard exercise modality for patients with chronic 
heart failure.

70% of maximal heart rate every 3 weeks.8 In all 3 groups, 
there were no supervised training sessions after the 12-week 
interventions, but the investigators had telephone contact with 
the participants every 4 weeks to register clinical events and 
to encourage physical activity.
Clinical Assessments
Screening procedures and clinical assessments before and 
after exercise interventions were performed at local study 
centers as previously described.8 Briefly, medical history, 
anthropometrics, physical examination including fasting blood 
sampling, quality-of-life questionnaires, cardiopulmonary exer-
cise testing, and echocardiography were performed, in addi-
tion to prespecified substudies.
Echocardiography data were acquired according to stan-
dard operation procedures of the study, stored digitally, and 
transferred as DICOM (digital imaging and communications in 
medicine) files or raw data to the core laboratory in Trondheim, 
Norway. Analyses were performed by 1 of 2 expert echocar-
diographers (A.S. and H.D.) blinded to group assignment but 
not always to time point of assessment on EchoPAC SW (ver-
sion BT 11–13; GE Ultrasound, Horten, Norway). LVEDD was 
measured at the tip of the mitral leaflet in the 2-dimensional 
parasternal long-axis view.10 Repeatability was tested by Bland-
Altman analyses of the first 25 baseline assessments between 
the 2 investigators. There was no bias (0.3 mm), and the coef-
ficient of variation was 4.1%.
Cardiopulmonary exercise testing was performed with 
standard equipment for indirect calorimetry in an incremen-
tal protocol until exhaustion on either a treadmill or a bicycle 
ergometer, depending on exercise training equipment. The 
protocol comprised a 10- or 20-W increase in workload ≈1 
minute, starting at 20 or 40 W, respectively. For comparisons 
per patient, the baseline, 12-week, and 52-week tests were 
performed with the same protocol. The mean of the 3 highest 
10-second consecutive measurements was identified as peak 
oxygen uptake (Vo2peak). Respiratory quotient and other related 
values are reported from this time point. Cardiopulmonary 
exercise testing personnel were not blinded to assignment to 
intervention group, but analysis was performed separately by 
an independent investigator (P.B.).
End Points
The primary end point was comparison of groups with respect 
to change in LVEDD from baseline to the 12-week assess-
ment by echocardiography. Key secondary end points were 
change in left ventricular ejection fraction and Vo2peak; the latter 
was also considered a measure of training effect. Safety was 
assessed by the rate of serious adverse events (SAEs) defined 
as all-cause and cardiovascular death, worsening heart failure 
requiring hospitalization or intensified diuretic treatment, atrial 
and ventricular arrhythmias, unstable angina, inappropriate 
implantable cardioverter-defibrillator shocks, and other events 
leading to hospital admission or clinical evaluation. Events were 
considered training related when occurring during or within 3 
hours of supervised exercise training sessions. An indepen-
dent blinded end-point committee (J.K., R.H., and S.G.) clas-
sified all events. Quality of life was assessed with the Kansas 
City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire, the Hospital Anxiety and 
Depression Scale, the Global Mood Scale, and the Type D 
Scale 14. Physical activity was assessed with the International 
Physical Activity Questionnaire (7-day short form), but its reli-
ability and validity have not been established in patients with 
heart failure, so the data have not been included. The measure-
ments were taken at baseline, at 12 weeks immediately after 
the intervention, and at follow-up 52 weeks from the start of 
the training program.
Statistical Analysis
Power calculations for the main end point (comparison of 
the groups with respect to change in LVEDD from baseline to 
12 weeks) have been detailed in a previous article on ratio-
nale and design.8 We estimated that a total number of 200 
patients, randomized 1:1:1 between RRE, MCT, and HIIT, 
would be sufficient to detect a reduction of LVEDD of 3.0 mm 
between HIIT and MCT and 5.0 mm between HIIT and RRE. 
Calculations were based on LVEDD of 70 mm, coefficient 
of variance of 0.04, statistical power of 0.90, and value of 
P=0.05, adjusted for 3 comparisons by the Bonferroni cor-
rection. Unless otherwise specified, data are presented as 
median with 95% confidence interval of the median because 
many variables were nonnormally distributed or as observed 
numbers with percentages.
The main end-point analysis was prespecified as mixed-
models linear regression with robust standard errors, with 
12-week values used as outcome and baseline values used 
as adjustment variables, and included adjustments for center, 
ischemic or nonischemic pathogenesis, and height. Model fit 
was checked by residual plots, and estimated contrasts are 
presented with 95% confidence intervals and P values cor-
rected for 3 pairwise comparisons with the Scheffé method. 
For comparisons including the 52-week data, similar analyses 
were performed. A 2-sided value of P≤0.05 was considered 
statistically significant.
To monitor adherence to training intensity, heart rate and 
workload were recorded during training sessions, and aver-
age training intensity was calculated as percentage of maximal 
heart rate at baseline. For HIIT and MCT patients, regression 
models including average percentage of maximal heart rate 
during training (continuous variable or lowest versus highest 
quartile), atrial fibrillation (yes versus no), or smoking (present 
versus former/never) were developed.
The study was not powered to assess differences in safety 
or clinical events; therefore, SAEs were not a prespecified end 
point.8 However, safety is an important concern in this popula-
tion, especially when performing exercise. With acknowledg-
ment of the limitations of post hoc analysis,11 χ2 tests for 
cardiovascular, noncardiovascular, and total SAEs during the 
training intervention period and during follow-up were per-
formed with no corrections for multiple testing. Statistical 
analyses were performed with Stata (version 13.1, StataCorp, 
College Station, TX).

out because of SAEs, and 7 withdrew or were lost 
to follow-up (Figure 1). Two hundred fifteen patients 
were assessed after 12 weeks and were included in 
the intention-to-treat analysis reported here. Median 
adherence to supervised training was 35 (34–36) ses-
sions of 36 possible in HIIT and MCT and 4 (3–4) of 4 
in RRE. Eight patients completed <24 of 36 exercise 
sessions, leaving 207 patients included in the per-
protocol analysis that yielded equivalent results (data 
not shown).
Baseline characteristics were similar in all groups, al-
though more RRE patients had a history of hypertension 
(Table 1). Median age was 60 years (interquartile range 
[IQR] 53–70 years); 71% were in New York Heart Asso-

Enrollment was stopped when it was estimated that at least 200 patients would complete the 12-week assessments according 
to protocol. Two hundred fifteen patients came to follow-up assessments and were included in the intention-to-treat analysis; 207 
of these were included in per-protocol analysis. Two hundred two patients came to the 52-week assessments and fulfilled the cri-
terion of having completed either echocardiography or cardiopulmonary exercise testing. LVEF indicates left ventricular ejection 
fraction; and SAE, serious adverse event.

Training Intensity Compared With Protocol Targets
Heart rate and workload were monitored at all centers dur-
ing the supervised training sessions (Figure 2). Average 
heart rate during sessions remained unchanged in the 12 
weeks of supervised training, indicating constant relative 
exercise intensity during interventions (Figure 2A). Work-
load during intervals in the HIIT group was consistently 
33 W (IQR, 24–42 W; P<0.001), higher than during con-
tinuous exercise in MCT (Figure 2B). Median relative train-
ing intensity based on maximal heart rate was 90% (IQR, 
88%–92%) in HIIT and 77% (74%–82%) in MCT. Thus, the 
difference in training intensity was only 10% (8%–13%) with 
adjustment for center and pathogenesis (Figure 2C) com-
pared with the protocol target difference of 27.5%. The 
training records showed that 51% of the patients in the 
HIIT group exercised at a lower intensity than prescribed, 
whereas 80% of those in the MCT group trained at a higher 
intensity than the protocol target (Figure 2D).
Echocardiography and Cardiopulmonary 
Exercise Testing
Table 2 presents the crude within-group changes in 
main results from baseline to 12 and 52 weeks. Re-
sults of the prespecified primary analyses, the adjusted 
between-group differences in changes in LVEDD from 
baseline to 12 weeks (primary end point), are given in 
Table 3. Change of LVEDD in HIIT was not significantly 
different from that in MCT (−1.2 mm; −3.6 to 1.2 mm; 
P=0.45) but larger than in RRE (−2.8 mm; −5.2 to 
−0.4 mm; P=0.02), whereas the change in MCT was 
not significantly different from the change in RRE (−1.6 
mm; −4.2 to 1.1 mm; P=0.34; Table 3). There were no 
other significant differences in echocardiographic mea-
surements or in prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide 
(Table 3 and Table I in the online-only Data Supplement).
Change in Vo2peak in HIIT was not significantly dif-
ferent from MCT (−0.4 mL·kg−1·min−1; −1.7 to 0.8 
mL·kg−1·min−1; P=0.70) but was 1.4 mL·kg−1·min−1 
(0.2−2.6 mL·kg−1·min−1; P=0.02) larger than in RRE. 
Change in Vo2peak was 1.8 mL·kg−1·min−1 (0.5−3.0 
mL·kg−1·min−1; P=0.003) larger in MCT compared with 
RRE (Table 3 and Table II in the online-only Data Supple-
ment). There were no differences in respiratory quo-
tient between groups at Vo2peak at baseline, 12 weeks, 
or 1 year, indicating similar levels of effort during test-
ing (Table II in the online-only Data Supplement). At the 
1-year follow-up, there were no differences in primary or 
secondary end points between the groups (Table 3 and 
Tables I–III in the online-only Data Supplement).

Sensitivity analyses exploring factors that might 
have influenced the changes of LVEDD in response 
to exercise did not identify predictors of response. 
Change of LVEDD in HIIT and MCT was not associated 
with average percentage of maximal heart rate dur-
ing supervised training sessions when added to the 
regression model (P=0.52) or when used to substitute 
for intervention group (P=0.24). Likewise, findings 
were similar when comparing patients in the highest 
and lowest quartiles of achieved percentage of maxi-
mal heart rate during training and when using these 
quartiles as a categorical variable. Change in LVEDD 
was also not associated with atrial fibrillation (P=0.22). 
An alternative model for LVEDD changes from baseline 
to 12 weeks excluding patients with atrial fibrillation 
gave results comparable to the results from the model 
with all patients, albeit with slightly larger effect sizes 
for HIIT versus RRE (−3.7 mm; −6.7 to −0.8 mm; 
P=0.009) and for HIIT versus MCT (−2.0; −4.9 to 0.9 
mm; P=0.23). Smoking was not significantly associ-
ated with change in LVEDD (P=0.26). There was no dif-
ference in exercise intensity assessed as percentage 
of maximal heart rate during sessions between cen-
ters (P=0.61) or between training on treadmill (89%; 
Figure 2. Training intensity during the 12-week intervention. 
A, Heart rate during training. Average heart rate during the 12-week intervention, estimated as weekly mean (SD) during moder-
ate continuous training (MCT) and during the last 2 minutes of high-intensity interval training (HIIT). Constant difference between 
groups: 16 bpm (10–22 bpm; P<0.001). B, Workload. Average workload estimated as for heart rate. Difference between 
groups: 33 W (24–42 W; P<0.001). C, Training intensity. Average relative training intensity (percentage of maximal heart rate) 
estimated as for heart rate: HIIT, 90% (88%–92%); MCT, 77% (74%–82%); difference, 10% (8%–13%; P<0.001). Some of the 
variability in estimated training intensity probably results from variation in maximal heart rate. Comparing baseline and follow-
up assessments in individual patients revealed differences that seemed randomly distributed and independent of intervention 
group, center, and whether the patients had sinus rhythm or atrial fibrillation (data not shown). Shaded areas mark boundaries of 
prescribed training intensity: HIIT, 90% to 95%; MCT, 60% to 70%. D, Training intensity on target. Distribution of average training 
intensity during the 12-week intervention; MCT, left histogram; HIIT, right histogram. Shaded areas mark boundaries for pre-
scribed training intensity. Fifty-one percent of HIIT patients exercised below their prescribed training intensity, and 80% of MCT 
patients exercised above theirs. Density scales the height of the bars so that the sum of their areas equals 1.00.

82%–92%) versus bicycle (85%; 83%–88%; P=0.20),

rately (data not shown).
Quality of Life
There were no within-group or between-group differenc-
es in the quality-of-life measures Kansas City Cardiomy-
opathy Questionnaire, Hospital Anxiety and Depression 
Scale, Global Mood Scale, or Type D Scale 14 at base-
line, 12 weeks, or 52 weeks (Table III in the online-only 
Data Supplement).
Serious Adverse Events
There were no statistically significant differences be-
tween groups in total number of patients with SAEs or 
cardiovascular SAEs during the 12-week intervention, al-
though SAEs were numerically higher in HIIT, followed by 
MCT and RRE (Table 4). During the follow-up period from 
week 13 to 52, there was a possible trend (uncorrect-
ed P=0.10) for more patients admitted to hospital with 
cardiovascular events in HIIT (n=19) and RRE (n=17) 
compared with MCT (n=8), mainly because of fewer ad-
missions for heart failure worsening in MCT (Table 4). 
This was also reflected in the 52-week total number of 
patients with SAEs: HIIT, 32 (39%); RRE, 26 (34%); and 
MCT, 18 (25%; P=0.16). The corresponding number of 
fatal events at 52 weeks was as follows: HIIT, 3; RRE, 1; 
and MCT 3.
Details of diagnoses and time of events, including 
multiple diagnoses or multiple admissions in single pa-
tients, are reported in Table IV in the online-only Data 
Supplement. Three events occurred during or within 3 
hours of supervised exercise in the HIIT group. One pa-
tient had ventricular arrhythmia with cardiac arrest dur-
ing supervised exercise in week 1, was successfully 
resuscitated, and stopped the exercise program. This 
patient had refused cardioverter-defibrillator implanta-
tion before inclusion. Another patient had inappropri-
ate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator discharge 
unrelated to arrhythmia during supervised exercise in 
week 12 and stopped the exercise program. A third 
patient experienced dizziness within 3 hours after su-
pervised exercise, with no detectable cardiovascular 
cause, and continued the exercise program without 
any reoccurrences.
DISCUSSION
The present study is the first randomized multicenter 
trial evaluating HIIT in chronic heart failure with reduced 
ejection fraction. It compares HIIT with the 2 most prev-
alent exercise prescriptions: a supervised program of 
MCT or RRE. The main finding was that 12 weeks of HIIT 
was not superior to MCT with respect to left ventricu-
lar reverse remodeling assessed as change in LVEDD. 
Although there was a statistically significant difference 
in remodeling between HIIT and RRE at 12 weeks, im-
mediately after the supervised exercise intervention, its 
clinical importance is uncertain.
The effects of HIIT were less than expected from our 
working hypothesis8 and from a previous study by Wis-
løff et al5 on which it was based. In the present study, 
change in LVEDD by HIIT was −2.8 mm relative to RRE 
compared with −4.5 mm from our working hypothesis

and −7.7 mm reported by Wisløff et al.5 In contrast, 
the change in LVEDD was −1.6 mm with MCT, which is 
similar to our prestudy estimate of −1.5 mm8 and −0.9 
mm observed in the previous study.5 Post hoc analy-
ses indicated that the magnitude of change in LVEDD 
may be larger with sinus rhythm compared with atrial 
fibrillation, but the present study was not powered to 
undertake a formal comparison. Change in LVEDD was 
chosen as the primary end point to represent change 
in cardiac remodeling because the echocardiograph-
ic measurement of diameter is more robust and has 
less relative variation than left ventricular volume es-
timates.10 The present study indicated nonsignificant 
changes in LVEDV of −19 mL with HIIT and −13 mL 
with MCT. This is in contrast to the large change of 
−45.2 mL previously observed with HIIT but similar 
to −15.2 mL observed with MCT5 and to a −11.5-mL 
change with MCT in a meta-analysis.7 The change in 
Vo2peak in the present study was 1.4 mL·kg−1·min−1 with 
HIIT and 1.8 mL·kg−1·min−1 with MCT relative to RRE. 
This is markedly less than the previously observed 6.0 
mL·kg−1·min−1 with HIIT but similar to 1.9 mL·kg−1·min−1 
with MCT5 and 2.1 mL·kg−1·min−1 in a meta-analysis.12 
Nonetheless, it is slightly larger than 0.6 mL·kg−1·min−1 
in the large HF-ACTION trial.4 It is notable that the dif-
ferences observed at 12 weeks, immediately after the 
supervised interventions, were not maintained at the 
52-week assessment, suggesting that the exercise 
prescriptions had not been followed as closely in the 
unsupervised period as in the supervised period.
Several factors may account for the small effect size 
of HIIT in the present study. Multicenter studies are more 
resistant to bias known to affect the study effects, espe-
cially compared with a single-center setting. Differences 
in the study population between our trial and the previ-
ous one by Wisløff and coworkers5 might also contrib-
ute to the different effects: All patients in the previous 
study had ischemic heart failure, although fewer than 
a third had a previous revascularization compared with 
60% in the present study. Furthermore, patients in the 
study by Wisløff et al5 were on average 15 years older 
and had a much lower Vo2peak at baseline compared with 
the present trial.
Another factor that may have reduced the response 
to HIIT is lower training intensity during intervals. In our 
trial, 51% of the HIIT patients unexpectedly trained at 
lower intensity than prescribed, whereas 80% in the MCT 
group trained at higher intensity. Despite the experience 
of cardiac rehabilitation of the participating centers, HIIT 
at 90% to 95% of maximal heart rate appeared difficult 
to achieve in a multicenter cohort of patients, whereas 
intensities at 60% to 70% of maximal heart rate in MCT 
seemed too low. It may be speculated that the response 
to HIIT might have been larger if target intensity had 
been achieved; however, we could not detect any dif-
ference of change in LVEDD when comparing the upper

HIIT indicates high-intensity interval training; MCT, moderate continuous 
training; and RRE, recommended regular exercise. There was no significant 
difference between the groups during the 12-week training intervention 
in terms of cardiovascular, noncardiovascular, or total number patients with 
serious adverse effects (χ2 test, P=0.61, 0.37, and 0.33, respectively). During 
the 13- to 52-week follow-up, there was a trend for higher numbers of patients 
with cardiovascular events in HIIT compared with MCT (χ2 test, P=0.10) as a 
result of fewer hospitalizations for worsening of heart failure in the MCT group 
but not compared with the RRE group. This same trend is also reflected in 
the number of cardiovascular events during weeks 1 to 52 and the total 
number of events during weeks 13 to 52 and 1 to 52 (χ2 test, P=0.21, 
0.06, and 0.16, respectively; P values not corrected for multiple tests).

and lower quartiles of percentage of maximal heart rate 
during exercise in the present study.
To date, only 1 study has had sufficient statistical 
power to assess safety with exercise training in patients 
with heart failure. The HF-ACTION study demonstrated a 
moderate reduction in the composite end point of mor-
tality and hospital admissions after 1 year.4 By design, 
the present study was too small to assess differences 
in safety among HIIT, MCT, and RRE8; however, numeric 
differences in clinical events could generate hypotheses 
and identify issues for special attention in future studies 
and follow-up. During the 12-week supervised training 
program, the number of patients with SAEs was small 
in all groups, and few patients withdrew from exercise 
training. These observations concur with comparisons of 
safety of HIIT versus MCT in patients with coronary ar-
tery disease that detected no differences in SAEs.13,14 In 
contrast, there was a numeric difference in patients with 
SAEs during the follow-up period from week 13 to 52 as 
a result of more hospitalizations for worsening of heart 
failure in HIIT and RRE compared with MCT. This trend 
was not statistically significant and resulted from post 
hoc subgroup analyses because SAEs were not a pre-
specified end point. Hence, conclusions or recommenda-
tions could not be based on this finding, but the numeric 
difference should receive attention in future trials.
Limitations
One of the important objectives of moving from a small 
proof-of-principle study to a type II multicenter study was 
to test whether the effect size would be conserved in 
a setting that is closer to a real-world clinical setting. 
Although several measures were taken to ensure qual-
ity and consistency, including supervised training ses-
sions based on heart rate monitoring, the differences in 
training intensity between HIIT and MCT were less than 
intended and partly overlapped. This was an unexpected 
finding, suggesting that the HIIT prescription of 90% to 
95% of maximal heart rate may be too high and the MCT 
prescription of 60% to 70% too low for some patients. 
For future studies, we suggest that exercise intensities 
should be regularly adapted to improvements in exercise 
capacity and to worsening of symptoms or changes of 
medication. Repeated assessment of maximal heart rate 
and more emphasis on adjusting workload according to 
perceived level of effort might also be helpful. We ex-
perienced that questionnaires were of limited value for 
assessing physical activity outside supervised sessions 
and recommend accelerometer recordings, particularly 
in the unsupervised follow-up period. Furthermore, in 
future studies, women should be a focus because only 
19% of the patients in this study were women. Although 
not unusual in similar studies, this sex bias was unin-
tended and constitutes a limitation of the generalization 
of the results.
Conclusions
The present multicenter trial did not confirm the hypoth-
esis that a 12-week program of supervised HIIT was 
superior to MCT in reducing left ventricular remodeling 
in patients with stable heart failure. None of the inter-
ventions led to deterioration of cardiac function com-
pared with RRE, and both exercise programs increased 
aerobic capacity, an important prognostic parameter of 
heart failure, to a similar extent. However, these posi-
tive changes were smaller than expected and were not 
maintained at follow-up after 52 weeks. Numeric differ-
ences in readmissions for worsening of heart failure 
suggested a favor of MCT relative to HIIT and RRE, but 
the study was not powered to assess safety. Train-
ing records showed that exercise intensities >90% of 
maximal heart rate were not achieved in a significant 
proportion of the patients. Thus, further studies are 
needed to define the role of HIIT as an alternative exer-
cise modality in patients with heart failure with reduced 
ejection fraction.
