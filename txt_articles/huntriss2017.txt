Abstract
Background/objectives Recently, the role of a low-carbohydrate diet in diabetes management has generated interest with
claims being made regarding its superiority over the traditional high-carbohydrate, low-fat dietary approach. This systematic
review and meta-analysis evaluated the interpretation and effect of a low-carbohydrate diet in the management of type 2
diabetes.
Subjects/methods Randomised controlled trials were searched for which included adults with type 2 diabetes aged 18 years
or more. The intervention was a low-carbohydrate diet as defined by the author compared to a control group of usual care.
MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, ISRCTN, ProQuest and opengrey.eu were
searched. Independent experts were contacted and reference lists of selected papers were checked. Results were analysed
descriptively and meta-analyses were completed to include trials that presented data at 1 year.
Results Eighteen studies (n = 2204) were eligible for inclusion within the systematic review. The definition of a low-
carbohydrate diet varied. At trial end, the descriptive analysis suggested that the low-carbohydrate intervention arm (LCIA)
may promote favourable outcomes in terms of HbA1c, triglycerides and HDL cholesterol. The LCIA demonstrated reduced
requirements for diabetes medication, which may have reduced the observed benefit of dietary carbohydrate restriction on
HbA1c. Seven studies provided data to be included in the meta-analyses at 1 year. The meta-analyses showed statistical
significance in favour of the LCIA for HbA1c (estimated effect = −0.28%, 95% CI −0.53 to −0.02, p = 0.03; χ2 = 13.15,
df = 6, p = 0.03; I2 = 54%), HDL cholesterol (estimated effect = 0.06 mmol/L, 95% CI 0.04–0.09, p < 0.00001; χ2 = 6.05,
df = 6, p = 0.42; I2 = 1%), triglycerides (estimated effect = −0.24 mmol/L, 95% CI −0.35 to −0.13, p < 0.0001; χ2 = 1.88,
df = 6, p = 0.93; I2 = 0%) and systolic blood pressure (estimated effect = −2.74 mmHg, 95% CI −5.27 to −0.20, p = 0.03;
χ2 = 10.54, df = 6, p = 0.10; I2 = 43%). Meta-analyses for weight, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and diastolic blood
pressure did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference between interventions.
Dietary adherence was an issue in most studies. A very low-carbohydrate diet (<50 g/day) seems unrealistic in this
population, however, a low-carbohydrate diet (<130 g/day) appears to be achievable. Improved clinical outcomes were
observed in some studies as a result of achieving a low- or moderate-carbohydrate diet.
Fifteen out of 18 studies were considered high risk of bias, with performance bias being a common issue.
Conclusions Reducing dietary carbohydrate may produce clinical improvements in the management of type 2 diabetes.
Further research is needed to understand the true effect of dietary carbohydrate restriction on HbA1c independent of
medication reduction and to address known issues with adherence to this dietary intervention. Clarity is needed regarding
appropriate classification of a low-carbohydrate diet.

 Introduction
Diabetes is a condition that remains high on the global
health agenda. The global prevalence of diabetes was esti-
mated to be 9% in 2014 [1] and it is predicted that diabetes
will be the seventh leading cause of death by the year 2030
[2]. In the United Kingdom, diabetes also poses a significant
health concern with ~3.9 million people living with diabetes
and around 700 people receiving a new diagnosis of dia-
betes each day, type 2 diabetes being the most prevalent [3].
Dietary carbohydrate restriction has become a topic of
interest to both patients and clinicians alike in recent years
[4]. Although it is known that the total amount of carbo-
hydrate consumed has the biggest effect on postprandial
blood glucose levels [5], evidence regarding the ideal
macronutrient composition for patients with type 2 diabetes
is unknown [5, 6].
For the United Kingdom, the Scientific Advisory Com-
mittee on Nutrition (SACN) [7] suggest that the national
dietary reference value for total carbohydrate intake for the
general population should remain at an estimated popula-
tion average of 50%, which is widely accepted as a high-
carbohydrate diet [4, 8]. However, some clinicians and
academics have called for a low-carbohydrate diet to be the
first-line treatment in type 2 diabetes [8].
Several randomised controlled trials have been com-
pleted since the publication of the last systematic review
considering the role of a low-carbohydrate diet in the
management of type 2 diabetes, which concluded that a
low-carbohydrate diet demonstrated no long-term super-
iority over other dietary interventions for patients with type
2 diabetes [9]. Therefore, the aim of the current systematic
review is to consider, in light of emerging evidence, the
clinical effect of a low-carbohydrate diet in the management
of type 2 diabetes, including an exploration as to the
interpretation
of
what
authors
understand
a
low-
carbohydrate diet to be.
Materials and methods
Papers were identified by completing an electronic search
on
the
following
databases:
MEDLINE,
EMBASE,
CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials,
ISRCTN, ProQuest and opengrey.eu. Searches were com-
pleted in June 2016. Two independent experts were con-
tacted with the aim of identifying any additional relevant
papers. Reference lists of selected papers were then checked
for further suitable papers.
The following search terms were used: ‘type 2 diabetes’
or ‘t2dm’ or ‘non-insulin dependent diabetes’ or ‘niddm’ and
‘low carbohydrate diet’ or ‘low CHO diet’ or ‘carbohydrate
restricted diet’ or ‘CHO restricted diet’. Only papers written
in English were accepted and no time
limits
were
imposed. Defined search terms were adhered to where
possible but were amended based on the capabilities of each
database.
Inclusion criteria were studies recruiting adults aged 18
years or above with a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. Only
randomised controlled trials were selected. The intervention
group had to be a low-carbohydrate diet as stated by the
author. The LCIA must have achieved a lower-carbohydrate
intake than the control group. The control group was usual
care, which included a variety of diets that could be offered
to patients as part of their diabetes care. Studies that
enrolled participants with type 1 diabetes, pre-diabetes or
participants who were pregnant as part of the study popu-
lation were excluded.
Studies were assessed for risk of bias using the Cochrane
Risk of Bias tool [10].
The primary outcome was change in HbA1c (%). Sec-
ondary outcomes were change in diabetes medications,
weight (kg), total, LDL and HDL cholesterol (mmol/L),
triglycerides (mmol/L), systolic and diastolic blood pressure
(mmHg), and dietary adherence.
Primary outcome data (HbA1c) were extracted at mul-
tiple time points including 3 months, 6 months, 12 months
and trial end. Weight was also extracted at multiple time
points as the trajectory of weight loss and the concept of
weight loss maintenance is often of interest within the field
[11]. The remaining outcomes were assessed at trial end. All
outcomes were analysed descriptively.
For outcomes with continuous data, a statistically sig-
nificant difference between groups was accepted if p < 0.05
or the 95% confidence interval did not include zero. When
analysing HbA1c, if a difference of 0.2 or 0.5% was seen
between groups, this was noted. An improvement of 0.5% is
generally considered to be clinically important
[12];
although a 0.2% improvement is of unknown short-term
clinical
relevance
[13],
some
suggest
that
such
an
improvement can improve mortality by 10% [14]. For the
purpose of this paper, no clinical difference between groups
was classified as <0.2% between groups.
Meta-analyses were performed for change in each out-
come at 1 year (to include 48 weeks). Therefore, studies that
were under 48 weeks in duration were not included in the
meta-analysis. It was agreed to discount any studies that
were under a year to decrease study design heterogeneity
and to allow for adherence issues that may occur in longer-
term studies that is more likely to reflect long-term beha-
viour of patients. Data from three-arm studies were exclu-
ded from the meta-analysis if insufficient detail was
reported to allow for a comparison between two arms, for
example, significance of the difference between groups was
reported across all groups with no reference to the sig-
nificance of the difference between individual arms.
R. Huntriss et al.
 Review Manager 5.3 software was used for the meta-
analyses, which calculated a pooled mean difference
between the change from baseline in the intervention and
control arms, and estimated its 95% confidence interval.
Along with the number of participants included in the
analysis of each study, the mean change and the associated
standard deviation in the intervention and control arm were
used when completing the meta-analysis; when the standard
deviation was not available, 95% confidence intervals were
used where possible. For studies that did not provide the
necessary data, the authors were contacted to ask for the
provision of the relevant data; studies were excluded if this
data was not provided. For studies that provided end-point
data as opposed to mean change from baseline, if sufficient
data available, mean change from baseline and the standard
deviation of the change was calculated by applying pub-
lished formulae [15]. The calculator function on Review
Manager 5.3 was used to generate the results of the meta-
analyses. The random-effects model was used as there were
variations within the methodologies of the trials [16]. Stu-
dies with marked study design heterogeneity were not
included in the meta-analyses. Statistical heterogeneity was
assessed using the χ2-test for heterogeneity interpreted using
the I2 statistic, which was interpreted according to Higgins
and Green [17]. In the meta-analyses, studies were inversely
weighted according to their study size, variance and the
inter-study variance statistic τ2, giving more weight to larger
studies with smaller variance.
Data regarding carbohydrate prescription advised to
participants in the LCIA and their mean final carbohydrate
consumption were extracted, where data were available.
Consumption was recorded in both g/day and %TEI (total
energy intake). When only one of these values were given
in a study, the corresponding value was calculated on the
basis of 1 g carbohydrate = 4 kcal, using the mean calorie
intake at trial end.
Nutritional data were extracted from the intervention and
control diets where data were available at trial end to
include mean percentage TEI from carbohydrate, protein,
fat, saturated fat, polyunsaturated fat, mono-unsaturated fat
and mean total intake of calories (kcal) and fibre (g). Means
and standard deviations were presented for each outcome of
each arm. A paired t test was used to compare the means of
both groups. Trials that used enteral or formula feeds and
three-arm trials with no obvious control were excluded from
this analysis. Papers that did not report nutritional data for
both the control and intervention diet were excluded from
the comparative analysis. See Fig. 1 for details of the study
selection process.
The protocol of this review was published on the
PROSPERO database prior to the commencement of the
review; registration ID: CRD42016035935.

 Results
Characteristics of included studies
Eighteen studies were selected for this review within which
2204 participants were randomised and data were analysed
for 1937 participants as some attrition was evident and not
all studies used intention-to-treat analysis.
Trial duration varied (Table 1). Three studies consisted
of three arms [18–20], with the remaining studies an
intervention arm and control arm.
Two studies used enteral feeds [21, 22] and one study
included partial use of formula feeds [24].
Risk of bias assessment
Fifteen out of the 18 studies were considered high risk of
bias in one or more of the six criteria (Supplementary Fig.
1). The risk of performance bias was a common issue for
these trials with 15 out of 18 trials (83%) at high risk. Due
to the nature of the intervention, authors had difficulty in
blinding the participants and study personnel to the inter-
vention with many authors discussing this issue. Some
studies were found to be at risk of detection bias, whereby
outcome assessors were not sufficiently blinded; whereas
assessment of objective measures was not deemed as
threatening, a lack of blinding of those assessing nutritional
composition of diets was observed in some studies. Insuf-
ficient detail of study processes often resulted in the cate-
gorisation of unclear risk of bias.
HbA1c (primary outcome)
Data from 17 studies were included in the descriptive
analysis of change in HbA1c. One study [25] was not
included within this analysis as the figures provided by this
study did not report change in HbA1c for the whole study
sample: outcomes were categorised by baseline HbA1c and
insufficient data were provided to include their findings in
the analysis.
Three months
Seven studies analysed HbA1c at 3 months. There appeared
to be a trend within the results: out of the seven studies
reporting at this time point, five reported an average dif-
ference of ≥0.2% favouring the LCIA with three of these
reporting a difference of ≥0.5%. The two remaining studies
showed no difference between groups. Two studies reported
a statistically significant difference in favour of the low-
carbohydrate intervention arm (LCIA) (p < 0.05) [21, 26];
however, when one of these studies adjusted the results for
differences in baseline HbA1c, statistical significance was
lost (p = 0.06) [26].
Six months
Eight studies reported change in HbA1c at 6 months. Seven
out of the eight studies reported an improvement of ≥0.2%
in favour of the LCIA with three studies reporting
improvements of ≥0.5%. The remaining study showed no
difference between groups. Four studies reported a statisti-
cally significant difference between groups in favour of the
LCIA regarding change in HbA1c at this time point [19, 24,
26, 28]; similarly here, after one study accounted for dif-
ferences in baseline HbA1c, statistical significance was lost.
Although differences between groups were not statistically
significant,
two
studies
considered
the
within
group
improvements in HbA1c [27, 34], both of which found a
statistically significant improvement in HbA1c in the LCIA
but not in the control group.
One year
Ten studies reported change in HbA1c at 1 year. Six studies
showed an improvement of ≥0.2% favouring the LCIA, of
which three studies showed an improvement of ≥0.5% in
the
LCIA.
Conversely,
one
study
[20]
showed
an
improvement of 0.2% in the control group; interestingly, the
baseline HbA1c for both the intervention and control arms
was considerably lower in this study than any other (Table
1). Three studies showed no difference between groups.
Four studies showed a statistically significant improvement
in HbA1c in the LCIA [18, 19, 29, 35].
Trial end
HbA1c was analysed at trial end with data available from
17 studies (Supplementary Table 1). A difference of ≥0.2%
was seen in 12 of the 17 studies (70.6%) in favour of the
LCIA; within these 12 studies, four studies found a differ-
ence of ≥0.5% favouring the LCIA. Four studies showed no
difference between groups. One study reported a difference
of 0.2% in favour of the control group [20]. Eight studies
showed a statistically significant difference between groups
in favour of the LCIA at trial end.
Meta-analysis for change in HbA1c at 1 year
Seven studies provided data for change in HbA1c at 1 year
appropriate for use in a meta-analysis (Fig. 2a). The meta-
analysis showed a statistically significant effect on HbA1c
in favour of the LCIA (effect estimate = −0.28%, 95% CI
−0.53
to
−0.02,
p = 0.03).

The interpretation and effect of a low-carbohydrate diet in the management of type 2 diabetes
 heterogeneity was evident (χ2 = 13.15, df = 6, p = 0.04; I2
= 54%).
The three-arm trials [18–20] were not included in the
meta-analyses as significance of the difference between
individual
arms
was
not
reported.
However,
their
inclusion would not have affected the outcome of this
result. While one study [20] found a marginal but statisti-
cally non-significant difference in favour of the control
group, the two other papers [18, 19] found a statistically
significant difference between groups in favour of the
LCIA. Therefore, inclusion of the data from these three
trials, had the data been available, may have further pro-
moted the superiority of the LCIA in improving glycaemic
control.
Medication changes
Out of the 18 studies included in this review, all but two
studies included participants on diabetes medication at trial
start [20, 35]. Two studies did not report on medication
changes [18, 28]. Out of the remaining 14 studies, every
study reported a reduced requirement for diabetes medica-
tion in the LCIA compared to the control group. Eleven
studies discussed the statistical significance of the difference
in medication reduction between groups. Nine of these
studies (82%) reported a statistically significant reduction in
diabetes medication in the LCIA (p ≤ 0.05)—finding a sta-
tistically significant reduction in insulin [21, 22], oral
hypoglycaemic agents [24, 34] or a combined diabetes
medication score [25, 26, 19, 32, 33] in the LCIA.
Regarding the two studies that did not include partici-
pants prescribed medication at trial start and one study
found no difference in commencement of diabetes medi-
cations at trial end (1 year) [20]. The other study found no
difference
in commencement
of diabetes
medications
between groups at 1 year, however, at 4 years, 44% of
participants in the LCIA in comparison to 70% of partici-
pants in the control group required treatment [35].
Weight change
Fifteen studies were included in the analysis for weight
change.
Three months
Five studies reported weight change at 3 months, of which
three reported a statistically significant difference between
groups in favour of the LCIA [23, 26, 30]; no study showed
a statistical significant superiority of the control group.
Six months
Out of the eight studies that reported this outcome at
6 months, four reported a statistically significant improve-
ment in favour of the LCIA [19, 24, 26, 30]. Four studies
Fig. 2 a Meta-analysis of change in HbA1c at 1 year. b Meta-analysis of change in weight at 1 year
R. Huntriss et al.
 showed no statistically significant difference between
groups.
One year
Out of 10 papers that reported weight change at 1 year,
three reported statistical significance in favour of the LCIA
[19, 30, 35]. However, one paper reported significance
across all time points simultaneously, whereas the absolute
difference between these two groups at 1 year was zero
[30]. No study showed statistical significance in favour of
the control group.
Trial end
At trial end out of 15 studies, five reported a statistically
significant effect in favour of the LCIA at trial end; this
includes the above-mentioned study where significance was
across all time points [30] (Supplementary Table 2). No
study favoured the control group in terms of statistical
significance.
Meta-analysis for change in weight at 1 year
For the six studies that provided appropriate data at 1 year,
the summary effect between interventions was not statisti-
cally significant (estimated effect = 0.28 kg, 95% CI −1.37
to 1.92, p = 0.74) (Fig. 2b). Heterogeneity was statistically
significant (χ2 = 20.25, df = 5, p = 0.001; I2 = 75%).
Total cholesterol
Fifteen studies collected data for total cholesterol (Supple-
mentary Table 3). No study found a statistically significant
difference between groups, suggesting no superior effect of
the LCIA or the control group regarding this outcome.
The meta-analysis including seven studies at 1 year also
concluded no superior effect of either intervention (esti-
mated effect = −0.08 mmol/L, 95% CI −0.23 to 0.08, p =
0.35). Heterogeneity was statistically significant (χ2 =
14.83, df = 6, p = 0.02; I2 = 60%) (Fig. 3a). When trans-
forming the data from the paper by Guldbrand et al. [34] as
per published formulae [15], a clinically irrelevant differ-
ence of 0.001, instead of no observed difference, in the
control group was used to allow the data to be utilised in the
meta-analysis (Fig. 3a).
LDL cholesterol
Fifteen papers reported LDL cholesterol outcomes (Sup-
plementary Table 4). One study showed a statistically sig-
nificant difference across all groups with the best results
seen in the LCIA [18]. The remaining studies showed no
statistically significant
difference
between
intervention
groups.
Five studies provided appropriate data to be included in
the meta-analysis at 1 year for this variable, which also
concluded no superior effect of either intervention (esti-
mated effect = 0.05 mmol/L, 95% CI −0.10 to 0.19, p =

 0.54). Heterogeneity was not statistically significant (χ2 =
2.97, df = 4, p = 0.56; I2 = 0%) (Fig. 3b).
HDL cholesterol
Data from 16 studies concerning HDL cholesterol appeared
to show a trend in favour of the LCIA with seven out of the
16 studies reporting a statistically significant difference in
favour of the LCIA (Supplementary Table 4). No studies
reported statistical significance in favour of the control
group. In one study, although the difference between groups
was not statistically significant, change in HDL cholesterol
within the LCIA was statistically significant but was not in
the control group [27]. Authors of one paper did not report
on the cholesterol outcomes covered in this review, but
there was a statistically significant difference between
groups for total: HDL cholesterol in favour of the LCIA
[23]. One paper did not provide HDL cholesterol results for
the group as a whole, their analysis categorised participants
into those with a baseline HDL cholesterol level of below
1.3 or above or equal to 1.3. In the latter group, the dif-
ference in HDL cholesterol improvement was statistically
significant in favour of the LCIA; statistical significance
was not reported for the former group [25].
The pooled analysis of seven studies showed a statisti-
cally significant effect favouring the LCIA in improving
HDL cholesterol levels at 1 year (estimated effect = 0.06
mmol/L, 95% CI 0.04–0.09, p < 0.00001). There was no
evidence of statistical heterogeneity (χ2 = 6.05, df = 6, p =
0.42; I2 = 1%) (Fig. 4a).
Triglycerides
Eighteen studies provided change in triglyceride level data
(Supplementary Table 5). Eight studies found a statistically
significant difference between groups in favour of the
LCIA. No studies found a statistically significant difference
in favour of the control group. One study found no sig-
nificant difference between groups, but found the change
within the LCIA to be statistically significant but the change
in the control group was not [26].
The results of the pooled analysis at 1 year that includes
seven studies suggest that the LCIA was favoured with a
high
statistical
significance
(estimated
effect = −0.24
mmol/L, 95% CI −0.35 to −0.13, p < 0.0001). There was
no evidence of statistical heterogeneity (χ2 = 1.88, df = 6, p
= 0.93; I2 = 0%) (Fig. 4b).
Blood pressure
Fourteen studies reported blood pressure outcomes (Sup-
plementary
Table
6).
Two
studies
found
the
LCIA
demonstrated statistically significant improvements in sys-
tolic blood pressure [29, 32] and two studies found that the
LCIA demonstrated statistically significant improvements in
diastolic blood pressure [20, 29] over a control diet. The

 remaining studies found no statistically significant differ-
ence between intervention and control groups.
However, when results from seven studies were pooled
together at 1 year, a statistically significant superiority was
seen in the LCIA with regard to systolic blood pressure
(estimated effect = −2.74 mmHg, 95% CI −5.27 to −0.20,
p = 0.03). There may be evidence to suggest moderate
heterogeneity (χ2 = 10.54, df = 6, p = 0.10; I2 = 43%) (Fig.
5a).
The pooled analysis from seven studies for diastolic
blood pressure did not demonstrate a statistically significant
difference
between
groups
(estimated
effect = −0.99
mmHg, 95% CI −2.24 to 0.25, p = 0.12). There was no
evidence of statistical heterogeneity (χ2 = 7.10, df = 6, p =
0.31; I2 = 15%) (Fig. 5b).
Interpretation of a low-carbohydrate diet
All authors described the intervention diet to be low-
carbohydrate. However, although 10 out of the 18 studies
prescribed a low-carbohydrate diet (six prescribing a very
low-carbohydrate diet), five studies prescribed a moderate-
carbohydrate diet, one study prescribed a high-carbohydrate
diet with one another study prescribing up to 50% TEI from
carbohydrates that encompasses a range of up to and
including a high-carbohydrate diet (Table 1). Please see
defined categorisations in Table 2. One study did not
specify the quantity of carbohydrate prescribed to the low-
carbohydrate group, but had the aim of increasing total fat
intake by 10% [20].
Dietary adherence
Excluding trials involving enteral or formula feeds, 12 trials
specified a carbohydrate prescription and reported carbo-
hydrate intake at trial end in the LCIA. Two trials managed
to achieve their set carbohydrate intake target in the inter-
vention arm, one which prescribed a low-carbohydrate diet
[28] and one that prescribed up to and including a high-
carbohydrate diet [35]. Adherence appeared to be particu-
larly problematic for those studies who set out to achieve a
very low-carbohydrate diet (<50 g carbohydrate per day),
with only one out of the six trials that prescribed a very low-
carbohydrate diet being able to achieve this target as an
average value in the LCIA [26]; this study prescribed <20
g/day and achieved an average carbohydrate intake of 49 g/

The interpretation and effect of a low-carbohydrate diet in the management of type 2 diabetes
 day. It does appear that a low-carbohydrate diet of <130 g
carbohydrate per day is achievable as the average carbo-
hydrate intake at trial end from the aforementioned 12 stu-
dies was 106 g per day (Supplementary Table 7).
Nutritional breakdown of intervention and control
diets
Twelve studies were included in this comparative analysis
(Table 3). Comparative analysis of the intervention and
control diet showed that the difference between mean daily
calorie intake of both groups was not statistically significant
(p = 0.458). Carbohydrate and fibre intake was lower in the
LCIA. Protein and fat intake was higher in the LCIA.
Within the dietary fats analysed, the greatest difference was
the increase observed in mono-unsaturated fat intake in the
LCIA, with a difference of 7.46% seen between groups (p
= 0.016); the LCIA demonstrated increased consumption of
saturated and polyunsaturated fats. The total percentage
increase seen in unsaturated fats in the LCIA was 10.77%
and saturated fats intake increased on average by 3.52%.
Discussion
Glycaemic control
Results from the descriptive and meta-analyses suggest that
reducing carbohydrate intake may have a favourable effect
on HbA1c.
The previous systematic review concluded there was no
superiority of a low-carbohydrate diet in improving HbA1c
while assessing interventions with a maximum intake of
130 g carbohydrate [9]. A previous meta-analysis that
considered a reduced-carbohydrate intake to <45% TEI
reported the superiority of a carbohydrate-restricted diet
compared to a control in improving HbA1c [36]. The cur-
rent review considered low-carbohydrate dietary interven-
tions as defined by the author; therefore, although there was
a carbohydrate reduction, this was not always limited to
<130 g carbohydrate/day.
From all 14 papers that included participants on diabetes
medication at trial start and reported changes in diabetes
medication, there was a unanimous report of the superior
effect of medication reduction in the LCIA in comparison to
the control group, with nine out of 11 studies that discussed
statistical significance of the difference between groups,
finding a statistically significant reduction in diabetes
medication in the LCIA. Similarly, a recent review [37] also
found that the majority of studies considering the role of a
low-carbohydrate diet in type 2 diabetes management do
not account for medication changes making it difficult to
assess the efficacy of this dietary intervention.
The term glycaemic control is often used interchangeably
with HbA1c; however, this review proposes that a reduced
need for diabetes medication may also be an indicator of
glycaemic control as was suggested by several authors of
the included studies within this review [21, 22, 25, 33]. In
one study with insulin-treated participants [22], baseline
HbA1c was 6.9% (Table 1). Insulin requirements were less
in the LCIA but there was no difference in HbA1c between
groups at trial end. Guidelines suggest that patients taking
hypoglycaemia-inducing medication should be supported to
aim for an HbA1c of 7% [38], so arguably on average, this
group was already at glycaemic target at baseline and to aim
for a lower HbA1c may not have been clinically responsible
or necessary. Therefore, it should be acknowledged that for
participants on hypoglycaemia-inducing medication, when
HbA1c is close to or at glycaemic target HbA1c reduction
in HbA1c would not necessarily be a treatment aim, how-
ever reduction in medication could be. When glycaemic
control is considered solely from the perspective of HbA1c,
the significance of diabetes medication reduction is ignored.
Several authors of studies included within the review stated
that if medications had not been reduced, greater reductions
in HbA1c would have been seen in the LCIA [23, 25, 30].
Only one study included in the review did not demon-
strate an improved HbA1c or superior medication reduction

 in the LCIA [20]. The mean baseline HbA1c was con-
siderably lower in this study compared to the other trials
(6.1–6.2%) (Table 1) and no participants were taking dia-
betes medications at trial start. The mean baseline HbA1c,
in fact, was below the diagnostic criteria for diabetes of 48
mmol/mol or 6.5%, which may suggest that reducing diet-
ary carbohydrate may not have as significant an effect on
glycaemic control at lower HbA1c levels.
Lipid profile and blood pressure
The current review suggests that there is no significant
superior overall effect of either intervention arm regarding
total, LDL cholesterol or diastolic blood pressure. However,
improved triglyceride and HDL cholesterol levels were seen
in the LCIA across the included studies, demonstrated by both
the descriptive and meta-analyses. Meta-analyses also showed
improved systolic blood pressure outcomes within the LCIA
at 1 year. Results from other reviews [39, 40] have also found
that reducing carbohydrate intake can have favourable effects
on cardiovascular disease-related outcomes.
Concerns regarding a lower-carbohydrate, higher-fat diet
have existed for some time due to the fear of the potential
adverse cardiovascular implications that may result from an
increased fat intake, more specifically saturated fat. A recent
systematic review suggested that saturated fats are not asso-
ciated with all-cause mortality, CHD and CHD mortality as
had been previously thought [41]. However, a 2015 Cochrane
review [42] suggests that a small but potentially important
reduction in cardiovascular risk can be observed when redu-
cing saturated fat. The consensus remains to continue to
recommend replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats due
to their known superiority of the latter in promoting cardio-
vascular health [43]. Interestingly, this review found that the
main increase in dietary fats came from unsaturated fats, in
particular mono-unsaturated fats, which we do not believe has
been evidenced before when considering dietary carbohydrate
restriction for patients with type 2 diabetes.
Interpretation of a low-carbohydrate diet
This review assessed the effect of a ‘low-carbohydrate diet’
as interpreted by the authors of the studies, resulting in a
varied carbohydrate prescription across the studies, includ-
ing prescription of a high-carbohydrate diet in two cases
[24, 35] when following the more commonly used classi-
fications (Table 2). One study classified the dietary inter-
vention
as
low-carbohydrate
but
did
not
specify
a
carbohydrate prescription [20].
There seems to be a general agreement that there are two
ways to categorise a low-, moderate- or high-carbohydrate
diet: g/day or %TEI (Table 2). However, the two methods
of categorisation do not always work synergistically
alongside each other. If somebody is following a reduced-
calorie diet, a low-carbohydrate diet in grams per day could
also be categorised as a moderate-carbohydrate diet if using
%TEI. For example, participants in the LCIA in one study
in this review [23] consumed 109.5 g carbohydrate/day
(low-carbohydrate diet), but due to a lower-calorie intake,
this was 33.5% TEI (moderate-carbohydrate diet). In
another study [34], participants in the LCIA consumed 96.9
g carbohydrate per day (low-carbohydrate diet), but again,
due to a lower-calorie intake, this constituted a moderate-
carbohydrate diet in terms of TEI (31%).
This point should be acknowledged when delivering or
reporting on interventions and perhaps a consensus is nee-
ded with regard to the most appropriate way to categorise a
low-carbohydrate diet.
Adherence
Guidelines currently suggest that the ideal proportion of
carbohydrates in the diet for patients with type 2 diabetes is
unknown due to the lack of existing evidence, so guidance
remains to individualise treatment [44, 6], but national non-
diabetes-specific dietary guidelines provided by SACN [7]
continue to promote a high-carbohydrate diet, a dietary
reference value of 50%, which is coincidentally higher than
the estimated carbohydrate intake of adults in the United
Kingdom (46%) [7].
The majority of studies in this review demonstrated that
participants in the LCIA were not able to achieve the carbo-
hydrate prescription as set out by the investigators. However,
the average carbohydrate consumption across LCIAs was
106 g/day showing that achievement of a low-carbohydrate
diet is realistic and its demonstration was seen in many stu-
dies. Adherence to a very low-carbohydrate diet (<50 g/day),
although achieved in one study, seems an unrealistic target for
the majority of patients within this population group.
This review suggests that the prescription or achievement
of a low-carbohydrate diet is not necessarily required to
achieve improved clinical markers such as glycaemic control;
reducing carbohydrate to achieve a moderate-carbohydrate
diet can result in improved glycaemic control as was seen in
several of the featured studies [18, 21, 24, 35].
Other nutritional considerations of a low-
carbohydrate diet
Calories
The difference in daily calorie intake was not statistically
significant between groups, which may explain why the
results of this review did not find either intervention to be
superior in terms of weight loss, as was also found in other
systematic reviews and meta-analyses [36, 9]. The LCIA
The interpretation and effect of a low-carbohydrate diet in the management of type 2 diabetes
 appeared superior in promoting weight loss at earlier time
points, but the descriptive and meta-analyses failed to show
an obvious superiority at 1 year. It is known that low-
carbohydrate diets can see greater initial weight losses due
to loss of water [45], but ultimately it is likely that the total
calorie intake will determine change in weight, as has been
discussed elsewhere [37].
Fibre
SACN recommend that the dietary reference value for fibre
for adults in the United Kingdom should be 30 g/day [7]. By
restricting dietary carbohydrate, the likelihood of reaching
such targets is reduced, as was evidenced in this review.
Evidence from the SACN report concludes that diets rich in
dietary fibre are associated with lower incidences of cardi-
ovascular disease, coronary events, stroke, colorectal, colon
and rectal cancer; therefore, not reaching suggested targets
could increase the likelihood of the onset of these condi-
tions [7]. This review demonstrated that neither the control
or intervention diet achieved this target, with a lower fibre
intake observed in the LCIA. It is considered feasible to
achieve fibre targets while following a low-carbohydrate
diet [46], however, the importance of achieving fibre intake
should be highlighted when offering dietary advice to
support a low-carbohydrate diet, encouraging the con-
sumption of high-fibre carbohydrate alternatives.
Protein
This review demonstrated a slight but statistically sig-
nificant increase in relative protein contribution to the diet
in the LCIA. Proposed benefits of a higher protein diet
include increased satiety, promoting favourable weight
management effects [47], but concerns exist regarding the
effect that a high-protein intake may have on the kidneys.
Diabetic kidney disease is among the most frequently seen
complications of diabetes, with diabetes accounting for
~50% of all cases of end-stage renal disease [48]. Currently,
there is little evidence to suggest that a high-protein intake
would be detrimental to those with good kidney function,
however, a high-protein diet may be detrimental to those
with existing renal dysfunction [49]. Therefore, if patients
with type 2 diabetes wish to increase their protein intake to
complement a reduced-carbohydrate diet, kidney function
should first be assessed.
Overall nutritional adequacy of a low-carbohydrate diet
Concerns have been raised regarding the provision of cer-
tain vitamins and minerals when reducing the amount of
carbohydrate in the diet [50]. Achieving a nutritionally
adequate diet, although not realistically achievable while
following a very low-carbohydrate diet without supple-
mentation [51], is achievable following a low-carbohydrate
diet of <130 g/day [46]; however, wider nutritional mes-
sages to ensure overall nutritional adequacy of a low-
carbohydrate diet beyond carbohydrate consumption are not
often well relayed [52]. Therefore, it is recommended that if
prescribing any carbohydrate restriction of <45% TEI,
nutritional adequacy of the diet should be considered
ensuring that an adequate amount of vitamins, minerals and
fibre are supplied by the diet [53].
Limitations
In terms of study design, the main issue in terms of internal
validity of these studies is the lack of blinding of partici-
pants and study personnel, something that is difficult to
achieve given such an intervention; however, this should be
acknowledged when interpreting results. Furthermore, the
true effect of a reduced-carbohydrate diet on HbA1c could
not be observed due to medication adjustments; it is likely
that a greater reduction in HbA1c would have been seen in
the LCIA. There was study design heterogeneity present;
some studies prescribed a lower-calorie allowance to the
control group that adds another dimension of consideration
when comparing interventions as opposed to comparing
macronutrient composition of diets.
Several studies provided insufficient information and
could not be included in the meta-analyses, limiting the
number of studies and participants that could be included in
the pooled analysis. Authors should be reminded to follow
the reporting guidelines of the CONSORT statement, and
editors and reviewers of academic journals should refer to
CONSORT when reviewing manuscripts submitted for
publication.
Recommendations for future research
Based on the findings of this review, the authors recom-
mend the following areas for future research:
●
Exploration of the optimal level of dietary carbohydrate
for patients with type 2 diabetes.
●
The
effect
of
carbohydrate
reduction
on
HbA1c
independent of diabetes medication changes.
●
An economic evaluation of the cost savings made by
reducing diabetes medication as a result of dietary
carbohydrate reduction.
Conclusion
The aim of this systematic review was to explore the
interpretation and effectiveness of a low-carbohydrate diet
R. Huntriss et al.
 in the management of type 2 diabetes. The review, which
was shaped by Cochrane principles, sourced randomised
controlled trials that compared a low-carbohydrate diet, as
defined by the author, to a control diet representative of
usual care. The intervention and control arms were com-
pared against HbA1c, change in diabetes medications,
weight, lipid profile and blood pressure; dietary adherence
within the LCIA was considered in addition to a comparison
of the nutritional composition of the LCIA and control diets.
Descriptive analyses suggested that the LCIA may offer
superiority over control diets in improving HbA1c, HDL
cholesterol and triglyceride levels. The meta-analyses con-
firmed statistically significant superiority of the LCIA in
improving HbA1c, HDL cholesterol, triglyceride and sys-
tolic blood pressure levels at 1 year. Reducing carbohydrate
intake demonstrated a strong superiority over control diets
in reducing diabetes medication, which may have dimin-
ished the observed effects of a reduced-carbohydrate intake
on HbA1c. The LCIA appeared superior to control diets
regarding weight loss at earlier time points, but by 1 year
the difference was not notable. No significant difference
was observed in total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol or dia-
stolic blood pressure between groups.
Few studies were able to demonstrate achievement of
carbohydrate targets as set out by the authors of the studies.
However, findings suggest that although adherence to a
very low-carbohydrate diet is likely to be unrealistic for
patients with type 2 diabetes, achievement of low- and
moderate-carbohydrate diets is achievable. Where clinical
benefit was seen, it was not limited to the achievement of a
low-carbohydrate diet, reducing carbohydrate intake to
achieve a moderate-carbohydrate diet also demonstrated
improved clinical outcomes in some studies. This review
does highlight the lack of clarity surrounding the term ‘low-
carbohydrate diet’. Moving forward, categorisation of diets
in terms of their carbohydrate provision needs to be more
consistent.
Risk of bias was high in the majority of included trials
due to the difficulties faced in blinding participants or study
personnel to the assigned dietary intervention; however, this
is
commonplace
in
many
trials
comparing
dietary
interventions.
Therefore, this review concludes that reducing carbohy-
drate intake may promote favourable health outcomes in the
management of type 2 diabetes in the context of a
healthy diet. Guidance remains to individualise dietary
advice to patients with diabetes. However, more research is
needed to determine whether there is an optimal intake of
dietary carbohydrate for patients with type 2 diabetes, and
to challenge whether the UK national dietary reference
value of 50% is appropriate for patients with type 2
diabetes.
