Autophagy, an evolutionarily conserved cytoplasmic degradation system, has been implicated
as a convergent mechanism in various longevity pathways. Autophagic activity decreases
with age in several organisms, but the underlying mechanism is unclear. Here, we show that
the expression of Rubicon, a negative regulator of autophagy, increases in aged worm, fly and
mouse tissues at transcript and/or protein levels, suggesting that an age-dependent increase
in Rubicon impairs autophagy over time, and thereby curtails animal healthspan. Consistent
with this idea, knockdown of Rubicon extends worm and fly lifespan and ameliorates several
age-associated phenotypes. Tissue-specific experiments reveal that Rubicon knockdown in
neurons has the greatest effect on lifespan. Rubicon knockout mice exhibits reductions in
interstitial fibrosis in kidney and reduced α-synuclein accumulation in the brain. Rubicon is
suppressed in several long-lived worms and calorie restricted mice. Taken together, our
results suggest that suppression of autophagic activity by Rubicon is one of signatures of
aging.

acroautophagy (hereafter, autophagy) is an evolutio-
narily conserved intracellular membrane trafficking
process in which double-membrane structures called
autophagosomes sequester cytoplasmic materials and fuse with
lysosomes, where their contents are degraded. Initially, autophagy
was described as a bulk degradation system, but it has become
clear that autophagy also selectively targets aggregated proteins,
lipids, damaged organelles, and invading bacteria. By driving the
degradation of a wide range of targets, autophagy maintains
cellular homeostasis; consequently, dysfunction in autophagy has
been implicated in many human diseases, including cancer,
neurodegeneration, and metabolic disorders.
Recent evidence has shown that autophagy is also involved in
animal aging. Autophagic activity decreases with age in many
species1–4. Studies using several model organisms including C.
elegans led to the discovery of several conserved longevity path-
ways, including mild reduction of insulin/IGF-1 signalling, calorie
restriction, germline removal, reduced mitochondrial respiration
and reduced TOR signalling. Importantly, all of these interven-
tions activate autophagy and extend animal lifespan in a manner
that depends on active autophagy, suggesting that autophagy is
one of convergent mechanisms of many longevity pathways5–9.
Moreover, overexpression of ATG5 in mice or neuronal Atg8 or
Atg1 in Drosophila extends lifespan4,10,11, although it remains
unclear why simple overexpression of genes involved in autop-
hagosome formation would activate autophagy. More recently, a
knock-in gain-of-function point mutation in Beclin-1 which
disrupt beclin1-BCL2 interaction and constitutively activates
autophagy has been shown to extend lifespan in both female and
male mice12. Although these accumulating evidences further
manifest the positive correlation between activation of autophagy
and longevity13, yet our knowledge of the molecular mechanism
by which autophagic activity declines with age is still limited14.
Although many autophagy related genes are positive regulators
of autophagy, we and others previously identified one of few
negative regulators of autophagy, Rubicon (Run domain Beclin-1
interacting and cysteine-rich containing protein), as a Beclin 1
interacting protein. Especially, Rubicon inhibits autophagosome-
lysosome fusion process as well as endocytic trafficking through
binding to PI3K (class III phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase) com-
plex15,16. Recently, we have found that Rubicon level is increased
in association of autophagy impairment in livers of mice fed a
high-fat diet, recapitulating NAFLD (nonalcoholic fatty liver
disease)17. Hepatocyte specific Rubicon knockout mice displays
significant improvement of liver steatosis and autophagy, indi-
cating upregulation of Rubicon plays a pathogenic role in
NAFLD17. Since the prevalence of NAFLD increases with
age18,19, we decided to examine the relationship between Rubicon
and aging. In the current study, we found that Rubicon is
increased in worm, fly and mouse tissues. Reduction of Rubicon
extends lifespan in worm and female fly and ameliorates age-
associated phenotype in worm, fly, and mouse tissues. These
results suggest that increase of Rubicon could be evolutionally
conserved

Results
C. elegans Rubicon homologue negatively regulates autophagy.
To examine the role of Rubicon in aging, we searched for C.
elegans Rubicon homologues and found that Y56A3A.16 has
sequence similarity to human Rubicon (KIAA0226), human
KIAA0226L (recently identified as Pacer)20, and Drosophila
Rubicon (dRubicon, CG12772)21 (Supplementary Fig. 1a, b). In
mammals, Rubicon inhibits autophagy, whereas Pacer is required
for normal progression of autophagy. Therefore, we next sought to
determine which of these two proteins is more functionally similar
to Y56A3A.16. Knockdown of Y56A3A.16 by RNAi significantly
increased the number of GFP::LGG-1 dots, an autophagosome
marker5,22, in intestinal cells (Fig. 1a, b) as previously observed in
Rubicon knockdown mammalian cells15. This increase was com-
pletely abolished by concomitant knockdown of bec-1/Beclin1 or
atg-18/Atg18, both of which function in autophagosome forma-
tion, suggesting that knockdown of Y56A3A.16 increased autop-
hagic vacuoles (Fig. 1a, b and Supplementary Fig. 1c). To further
discriminate whether knockdown of Y56A3A.16 increase or block
autophagic activity, we used the recently developed transgenic
worm expressing tandem fluorescent LGG-1 (mCherry::GFP::
LGG-1)1. With this reporter, autophagosomes (AP) are visualised
as punctae positive for both GFP and mCherry, while autolyso-
somes (AL) show only the mCherry due to quenching of GFP in
the acidic environment of lysosomes. We observed knockdown of
Y56A3A.16 significantly increases the numbers of autophago-
somes and autolysosomes in intestines and pharyngeal muscles
(Supplementary Fig. 2a–d), indicating that the pool size of
autophagosome and autolysosomes are increased by the knock-
down. Furthermore, to examine the autophagic flux, we injected
either DMSO or lysosomal inhibitor, BafA in control or
Y56A3A.16 knockdown worms and compared the number of
GFP::LGG-1 puncta. Unexpectedly, we could not observe the
significant difference between control and Y56A3A.16 knockdown
worms in DMSO injected worms. The exact reasons are unknown,
but the microinjection might cause the unknown stresses and
dampen the effect of Y56A3A.16 knockdown. Nevertheless, we
could clearly observed the statistically much increased numbers of
GFP::LGG-1 puncta in Y56A3A.16 knockdown worms after BafA
injection compared to control knockdown, suggesting that
Y56A3A.16 knockdown increases the autophagic flux (Fig.1c and
Supplementary Fig. 2e). Taken together with the fact that there is
only one Rubicon homologue in zebrafish and Drosophila (Sup-
plementary Fig. 1a)21, our results imply that Y56A3A.16 repre-
sents the ancestral homologue of Rubicon; accordingly, hereafter
we refer to Y56A3A.16 as RUB-1.
Knockdown of rub-1 extends lifespan. Interestingly, gene
expression analysis using RUB-1::EGFP transgenic worms in
which EGFP is expressed in several tissues including neurons,
intestine and pharynx and we observed RUB-1::EGFP was
increased in older worms (Fig.1d). qRT-PCR analysis revealed
that rub-1 was increased with age at transcript levels (Fig. 1e). On
the other hands, rub-1 was downregulated in several long-lived
mutants compared to wild type (Fig.1f). These results led us to
hypothesise that the age-dependent increase of Rubicon, a nega-
tive regulator of autophagy, could be one of causal factors for age-
dependent impairment of autophagy. Consistent with this idea,
knockdown of rub-1 by RNAi significantly extended wild-type
worm lifespan (Fig. 1g and Supplementary Fig. 3a, b). The rub-1
transcript level was decreased to ~40–50% of normal levels in
these animals (Supplementary Fig. 3c–e). Knockdown of rub-1
does not alter the pharyngeal pumping rates indicating that the
bacteria containing RNAi is properly took in (Supplementary
Fig. 3f). In mammalian cells, Rubicon has been shown to repress
both autophagy and endocytic pathway including recycling of
receptors such as transferrin receptor15. We saw that rub-1
knockdown did not largely alter the localisation of hTFR (human
transferrin receptor)::GFP in intestinal cells, suggesting that rub-1
might not have obvious function in endocytosis in worms (Sup-
plementary Fig. 2f). Importantly, the increase in longevity was
completely abolished when the autophagy regulators bec-1/
Beclin1, unc-51/ULK1 and atg-18/ATG18 were knocked down by
RNAi along with rub-1 (Fig. 1g and Supplementary Fig. 3a, b),

 indicating that the longevity enhancement conferred by knock-
down of rub-1 is dependent on autophagic activity. Conversely,
we found that the overexpression of rub-1 shortened wild-type
worm lifespan (Supplementary Fig. 4a, b). Together our results
suggest rub-1 regulates the lifespan by modulating autophagic
activity.
In worms, several different longevity pathways and corre-
sponding long-lived mutants have been well characterised; these
pathway include reduction of insulin/IGF-1 signalling (daf-2),
germline removal (glp-1), calorie restriction (eat-2) mitochondrial
dysfunction (isp-1) and downregulation of TOR signalling. These
animals show increased autophagy and the longevity depends on
active autophagy8,23. Therefore we checked the genetic interac-
tion between rub-1 and some of these longevity pathways. rub-1
knockdown did not further extend lifespan of daf-2, glp-1, isp-1
and eat-2 animals (Supplementary Fig.4c–f). Although technically
we did not check all of these longevity mutants, rub-1 knockdown
did not change the numbers of autophagosomes in tested long-
lived animals (Supplementary Fig.5). Interestingly, rub-1 knock-
down additionally extended lifespan of TOR knockdown animals
(Supplementary Fig.4g), implying these two genes act at least
partly in parallel.
Knockdown of rub-1 ameliorates age-associated phenotypes.
We next investigated whether knockdown of rub-1 would impact
other age-onset phenotypes. Worms expressing polyglutamine
(polyQ)-YFP in body wall muscle exhibit age-onset aggregation of
GFP::LGG-1

Fig. 1 C. elegans Rubicon regulates lifespan via modulating autophagy. a Autophagosomes labelled with GFP::LGG-1 (open arrowheads) were more

 the polyQ fusion protein24. Knockdown of rub-1 reduced the
level of aggregation, whereas concomitant knockdown of bec-1/
Beclin 1 reverted the reduction, indicating that knockdown of
rub-1 decreases aggregation of polyQ fusion protein in an
autophagy-dependent manner (Fig. 2a, b). Locomotion activity
goes down with age, and velocity correlates well with longevity25.
A multi-worm tracking system allowed us to monitor the
tracks of individual worms and calculate their locomotion
speed26. This analysis revealed that rub-1 knockdown slowed
down the age-dependent decline in locomotion activity in an
autophagy-dependent
manner
(Fig.
2c
and
Supplementary
Fig. 6a). Many long-lived animals often show the resistances
against several stresses including oxidative stresses and heat
stresses. We found that knockdown of rub-1 increases the oxi-
dative stress resistance in an autophagy-dependent manner (Fig.
2d). On the other hands heat stress resistance is not changed
(Supplementary Fig. 6b), indicating that rub-1 knockdown con-
fers the different downstream output with regard to the stress
resistance.
Tissue specific roles of rub-1 regulating lifespan. Next we also
investigated which tissues of rub-1 are responsible for lifespan
regulation in C. elegans. For this purpose, we used tissue-specific
RNAi-sensitive
strains,
including
TU3401
(neuron-specific,
using the sid-1 system)27, NR350 (muscle), VP303 (intestine)
and NR222 (hypodermis), for rub-1 knockdown (Fig. 3a and
Supplementary Fig. 7a–c)28. Surprisingly, knockdown of rub-1 in
neuronal cells extended lifespan most efficiently (Fig. 3a).
Hypodermal and intestinal knockdown of rub-1 extended
lifespan to a lesser extent but significantly (Supplementary
Fig. 7a-c). Because neuronal cells are normally resistant to RNAi
knockdown, the lifespan extension conferred by rub-1 knock-
down
in
wild-type
worms
might
reflect
combinatorial
effects from hypodermis, intestine, and other unidentified
tissues (Fig. 1g and Supplementary Fig. 3a, b). We observed that
atg-18/WIPI was required for longevity conferred by rub-1
knockdown in neuronal cells (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 7d).
To check the autophagic flux in neuronal cells, we injected DMSO
or
BafA
in
control
or
rub-1
neuron
specific
knockdown worms which express neuron specific GFP::LGG-1.
Unexpectedly, we could not detect the significant increase of
GFP::LGG-1 dots after BafA injection in control knockdown
worms. It could be possible that the basal autophagy is relatively
low in neuronal cells and is difficult to detect the flux at this
condition. Nevertheless, we observed the significant increase of
GFP::LGG-1 dots after BafA injection in rub-1 knockdown
worms, indicating the autophagic flux is increased in these
worms. (Fig. 3c, d). These results together imply that the lifespan
extension by rub-1 knockdown could be due to activation of
autophagy.
Knockdown of dRubicon extends lifespan in fly. To know if the
findings in C. elegans is conserved in other species, we first
checked expression of Drosophila Rubicon (dRubicon) and
observed the dRubicon was significantly upregulated in middle-
aged female fly (Day 14) compared to young fly (Day 2) (Fig. 4a,
b and Supplementary Fig. 8a, b). To assess autophagic activity, we
applied tandem fluorescent tagged Atg8a which are widely used

 in fly to monitor autophagic activity29. Systemic knockdown of
dRubicon significantly increased steady-state autophagosome and
autolysosome pools in the brain (Fig. 4c, d). Although in most
cases researchers in fly field concluded autophagy activation
based on these similar phenotypes, we could not completely rule
out the possibility of autophagy inhibition due to, for instance,
impaired lysosomal degradation30. Importantly, whole body
dRubicon knockdown slightly but significantly extended the life-
span in female specific manner (Supplementary Fig. 8c–e). In
addition, knockdown of dRubicon also improved compound eye
degeneration in MJDtr-Q78 (a truncated form of MJD/SCA3
containing an expanded glutamine tract) polyQ disease model
female flies (Fig. 4e, f). Rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTOR kinase
treatments increased the lifespan more in female mice than in
male. Thus, our observation might reflect the sexual dimorphic
contribution of autophagy to the animal lifespan.31–33 Further-
more, similar to worms, neuron specific knockdown of dRubicon
efficiently extended lifespan (both maximum and median life-
span) in female fly (Fig. 4g and Supplementary Fig. 8f). In
addition, neuron specific dRubicon knockdown decreased the
polyQ inclusions in female brain neurons (Fig. 4h, i) and miti-
gated the age-associated decline of locomotor function acceler-
ated by the polyQ cytotoxicity (Fig. 4j and Supplementary
Fig. 8g). These results indicate the conserved role of Rubicon,
knockdown of which extends lifespan and reduces the aggregates
of aggregation-prone proteins via modulating autophagic activity
between worm and female fly.
Rubicon deletion prevents age-associated phenotypes in mice.
Moreover, similar to worm and fly, we found that the Rubicon
transcript and protein level in kidney and liver were higher in
older animals (20 months of age) than in juveniles (2 months) in
mice (Fig. 5a, b, and Supplementary Fig. 9a–c). Interestingly, mice
subjected to 9-month calorie restriction exhibited reduced Rubi-
con protein levels both in liver and kidney (Supplementary Fig. 9
d, e), suggesting that Rubicon could be regulated downstream of
lifespan extending condition similar to worms. To understand the
role of Rubicon regarding animal aging in mice, we developed
Rubicon systemic-knockout mice, which exhibit higher levels of
LC3-II and reduced levels of the autophagic substrate p62, sug-
gesting activation of basal autophagy (Fig. 5c). Progressive fibrosis
is a histological hallmark of aging kidney34. Rubicon systemic-
knockout mice exhibited a reduction in age-associated fibrosis, as
determined by immunohistochemistry for collagen I (Fig. 5d, e).
This phenotype was confirmed by qRT-PCR detection of mRNAs
encoding fibrotic markers (Fig. 5f). Autophagy has been impli-
cated in several age-associated neurodegenerative disorders,
including Parkinson’s disease. In sporadic and familial Parkin-
son’s disease, affected neurons develop inclusions containing α-
synuclein (α-Syn). Elevated amounts of this protein are sufficient
to cause Parkinson’s disease. It is suggested that overexpressed
and misfolded aggregate-prone forms of α-Syn are degraded by
autophagy35–37. Therefore, we investigated whether forced acti-
vation of autophagy by deletion of Rubicon in neurons would be
sufficient to prevent aggregation of α-Syn in the brain. To explore

pathology. Together with the results in worms and fly, these
results suggest that neuronal knockdown of Rubicon is sufficient

 1–binding protein that represses autophagy and endocytosis15,16.
Here we characterised a role of Rubicon in different species and
found that its expression increased in aged worm, female fly and
mouse tissues for the first time. Our results suggest that the
increase in Rubicon levels, which causes suppression of autop-
hagic activity, curtails lifespan in worms and female fly and
causally contributes to several age-onset phenotypes, including
polyQ aggregation in worms and fly, fibrosis in mouse kidney and
α-Syn accumulation in mouse brain.
Although we have shown that Rubicon knockdown activates
autophagy, it remains unclear how Rubicon regulates autophagy.
In our previous paper, we showed that the Beclin 1 complex
containing Rubicon negatively regulates autophagy and endocy-
tosis15.
Specifically,
Rubicon
negatively
regulates
autophagosome–lysosome fusion steps. However, how this hap-
pens is still unclear and other unidentified mechanisms may
contribute to the repression of autophagy.
What is the substrate of autophagy that contributes to long-
evity? Mitophagy, which contributes to mitochondrial home-
ostasis, is essential for the lifespan extensions conferred by several
genetic and pharmacological treatments40–43. Thus, forced acti-
vation of autophagy by Rubicon knockdown could also activate
mitophagy, and this possibility will be addressed in our future
work. Lipophagy is also essential for longevity in C. elegans6,44.
Indeed,
we
previously
showed
that
liver-specific
Rubicon
knockout ameliorates liver steatosis in mice fed a high-fat diet17.
This effect seems to be mediated by enhanced lipophagy resulting
from Rubicon knockout. On the other hand, our results revealed
that among cell types, Rubicon knockdown in neurons extended
lifespan efficiently. Non-cell-autonomous neuronal regulation of
animal lifespan has recently attracted a great deal of attention in
the field45,46. In this context, enhanced autophagic activity might
contribute to the secretion of systemic signals from neuronal
cells;47 the candidate systemic signals include miRNAs, exosomes,
small molecules and hormones. Contrary, other group showed
that neuronal inhibition of autophagy after the reproductive
period results in the lifespan extension in worms48. We did not
address the timing issue in the current study and thus when and
how Rubicon functions in neurons have to be clarified in future
study.
Recent studies have revealed a positive correlation between
activation of autophagy and longevity. However, the fundamental
question of why autophagic activity declines with age in many
organisms remains unanswered. The results of this study show,
for the first time, that increase of Rubicon during aging could
help explain age-dependent impairment of autophagy, thereby
curtailing animal lifespan and promoting age-associated pheno-
types. How Rubicon is increased with age is of particular interest.
We found that Rubicon levels were at least altered by several
lifespan-extending conditions in worm and mouse tissues. These
observations could help study the underlying mechanism. In the
recent study, Prof. Levine’s group demonstrates that the disrup-
tion of Beclin1-BCL2 extends mouse lifespan and healthspan12.
As mentioned above, Rubicon is originally identified as Beclin 1-
binding protein. While BCL-2 inhibits Beclin1 complex involved
in the initiation of autophagy, another Beclin 1 complex con-
taining Rubicon involved autophagosome-lysosome fusion pro-
cesses. How different Beclin1 complexes are regulated during
animal aging is particularly interested and further studies focus-
ing on Rubicon and class III PI3K complex will open up novel
paths to extending animal lifespan.
Methods
C. elegans growth conditions and strains. Nematodes were cultured using
standard techniques at 20 °C on nematode growth medium (NGM) agar plates
with E. coli strain OP50, unless otherwise noted. The following worm strains were
used in the study; N2(WT); DA2123, adIs2122 [lgg-1p::GFP::lgg-1 + rol-6(su1006)];

lgg-1 + rol-6(su1006)]; MAH14, daf-2(e1370) III; adIs2122 [lgg-1p::GFP::lgg-1 + rol-
6(su1006)]; eat-2(ad465); adIs2122[lgg-1p::GFP::lgg-1 + rol-6(su1006)]. MAH242,
sqIs24 [rgef-1p::GFP::lgg-1 + unc-122p::RFP] was crossed with TU3401 to generate
the neuron specific sensitive strain expressing neuron specific GFP::LGG-1. hTFR::
GFP is a kind gift from Prof. Grant (Rutgers University)49. Strains used in this
study were summarised in Supplementary Table 2.
Plasmid construction and transgenesis. For rub-1:EGFP translational fusion
constructs, rub-1 4 kb endogenous promoter plus coding sequence were cloned into
pPD95.75 vector which contain EGFP tag Microinjection of the construct was
carried with the co-injection marker, myo-2p::mCherry to generate rub-1::EGFP.
Mouse. CAG-Cre mice and Nestin-Cre mice were imported from Jackson
Laboratory and Dr. Jun-ichi Miyazaki’s laboratory (Osaka University), respectively.
CAG-Cre mice were crossed with Rubiconflox mice17 to produce mice with systemic
Rubicon deletion. Resultant mice with the Rubicon- allele were backcrossed into the
C57BL/6 J wild-type strain five times, followed by intercrossing between Rubicon+/−
mice to generate Rubicon−/− mice and wild-type controls. The Nestin-Cre mice
were crossed with Rubiconflox mice to produce mice harbouring homozygous
deletion of Rubicon specifically in the brain. All mice used in this study were
maintained on a C57BL/6 J background, with the exception of the calorie restricted
mice. For those experiments, we used an adult-onset 40% calorie restriction pro-
tocol developed by Turturro et al50. Female BDF1 mice were reared individually in
cages. The CR protocol was continued until 9 months of age. Water was provided
ad libitum. Sequence information of primer pairs used for genotyping is available
upon request. Experimental procedures using mice were approved by the Institu-
tional Committee of Osaka University. All relevant ethical guidelines were com-
plied with. All mice were maintained under specific pathogen‐free conditions and

mittee of Osaka University Medical School (Osaka, Japan).
Fly stocks and culture conditions. Flies were grown on standard
cornmeal–agar–yeast-based medium at 25 °C. Transgenic fly lines bearing UAS-
MJDtrQ27 (#8149), UAS-MJDtrQ78s (#8150), UAS-MJDtr-Q78w (#8141), UAS-
GFP-IR (#9330), UAS-dRubicon (CG12772)-IR (#43276), UAS-GFP-mCherry-Atg8a
(#37749), da-GAL4 (#55849) and elav-GAL4c155 (#458) were obtained from the
Bloomington Stock Center. Transgenic fly lines harbouring GMR-GAL4 were
described previously51.
Lifespan analysis. For worms, synchronised eggs were obtained from 4–6 h egg
lays on RNAi plates. Starting with day 1 adults, lifespan experiments were set up at
a density of 15–20 animals per plate, and carried out at 20 °C. Worms were
transferred to new plates every other day. Survivorship was also counted every
other day. In case of glp-1 background, the egg lay was conducted at 15 °C and
shifted to 25 °C to induce germline-less phenotype for 2days. The lifespan
experiment of glp-1 animals was carried out at 20 °C from day1 adult stage. All of
RNAi lifespan was carried out from egg onward. Death was scored as the absence
of any movement after stimulation with a platinum wire. Worms that underwent
internal hatching or bursting vulva, or that crawled off the plates, were censored.
For TOR RNAi experiments, knockdown was performed from adult onward. For
statistics, we used in house excel data sheet that can perform log-rank test52.
Experimental flies were raised at a standard medium, allowed to mate for 48 h after
emerging, then sorted using CO2 anaesthesia. Vials were changed without anaes-
thesia to fresh food every 2–3 days, and deaths were scored until all flies were dead.
More than one hundred animals per each experimental group were used in the

 analyses. All lifespan experiments including repeats in worms are shown in Sup-
plementary Data 1.
RNA interference. RNA interference (RNAi) was conducted by feeding HT115
(DE3) bacteria transformed with vector L4440, which produces dsRNA against the
targeted gene. Synchronised eggs were placed on the indicated RNAi plates con-
taining IPTG and ampicillin. RNAi clones were obtained from the Ahringer or
Vidal RNAi library. The let-363/TOR RNAi clone was a gift from Dr. Hansen
(Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute). For double knockdown experi-
ments, equal volumes of bacteria for respective RNAi are mixed and seeded on
plates. Luciferase (L4440::Luc) RNAi were used as non-targeting controls. In case
of glp-1 background, the egg lay was conducted at 15 °C and shifted to 25 °C to
induce germline-less phenotype for 2days. For all RNAi experiments, except for
TOR RNAi lifespan, RNAi knockdown was conducted from egg onward (whole-life
knockdown).
RNA extraction and qRT-PCR. Worms, flies and mouse tissue samples were
harvested in TRIzol (Invitrogen) or QIAZOL (QIAGEN) at respective time points.
For worms, about 200 worms per condition were collected. Total RNA was
extracted using RNeasy kit (QIAGEN). cDNA was generated using iScript (Bio-
Rad) or PrimeScript RT reagent kit (Takara). qRT-PCR was performed with Power
SYBR Green (Applied Biosystems) on a ViiA 7 Real-Time PCR System (Applied
Biosystems) or with the KAPA SYBR Fast qPCR kit (KAPA Biosystems) on a
CFX96 Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad). Four technical replicates were
performed for each reaction. ama-1 or cdc-42 (worms), Hsc70 (flies), 18 s rRNA
(mice), and GAPDH (human) were used as internal controls. Sequences of qRT-
PCR primers are shown in Supplementary Table 1.
Autophagic flux assay in worms. Autophagy flux assay in C. elegans was per-
formed as described previously1. Briefly, After control or rub-1 RNAi knockdown,
50 μM of BafA in 0.005% DMSO or 0.005% DMSO only was co-injected with
2.5 μg/ml Cascade Blue Dextran into the intestine or head region of day1 adult
worms. For whole body knockdown, DA2123 (GFP:LGG-1 transgenic animals)
were used, while for neuron specific knockdown newly generated strains created by
crossing MAH242 with TU3401 were used. After the injection, animals were
allowed to recover on respective RNAi plates for two hours. Recovered worms were
then anaesthetised by 0.1% NaN3 and mounted on 2% agar pad. GFP::LGG-1
fluorescence was captured using a FV3000 confocal microscopy (Olympus). Six to
ten worms were imaged for each condition and the experiments were repeated
three times. No. of GFP::LGG-1 punctae of DMSO injected and BafA injected
worms in the anterior intestines and neuros were quantified using Image J.
Multi-worm tracking analysis. A 13 cm × 10 cm agar-filled plate was divided into
four regions of equal area. To keep animals from moving between regions, the
regions were surrounded with glycerol, an aversive stimulus for C. elegans. Worms
from a given experimental group were placed in one of the four regions, and
multiple experimental groups were tested simultaneously. An adapted version of
the Multi-Worm Tracker26 was used to record the locomotion of C. elegans on the
agar plates. Locomotion was recorded for 10 min and the recording was analysed
using Choreography (part of the Multi-Worm Tracker software) and custom-
written scripts to organise and summarise the data. Animal tracks were collected as
time series of centroid position for each frame of the final 2 min of the recording.
The initial 8 min were ignored to allow animal recognition by the tracker to sta-
bilise. The following Choreography filters were used to avoid image artefacts:
–shadowless and -t 10. The speed of an individual was calculated as the sum of
distances between sequential centroids, divided by the duration of the track.
Experimental groups were summarised using mean and standard error of the
mean, weighted by the duration of an animal’s track.
dRubicon antibody. To generate an affinity purified antibody against dRubicon,
C + EVPEEVHEKLQQAS peptide corresponding to amino acids 317–330 of
dRubicon was used to immunise rabbits. The antibody was purified from the
antiserum by using antigen peptide–conjugated resin. The peptides and antibody
were prepared by Eurofins Genomics Inc. (Japan).
Climbing assay. The climbing assay was performed according to a published
protocol53 with slight modifications. Ten to twenty files were placed in a conical
glass tube (length, 15 cm; diameter, 2.5 cm) without anaesthesia. Ten seconds after
tapping the flies to the bottom of the tube, the numbers of flies in each vertical area
were counted and scored as follows: score 0 (0–1.9 cm), 1 (2–3.9 cm), 2 (4–5.9 cm),
3 (6–7.9 cm), 4 (8–9.9 cm), 5 (10–15 cm). Three trials were performed on each
group at 20 s intervals, and the climbing score was calculated as follows: each score
multiplied by the number of flies was divided by the total number of flies, and the
mean score of the 3 trials was calculated. Results are presented as the mean ± S.E. of
the scores obtained in 3–9 independent experiments.
Microscopy and quantification. To monitor autophagic activity, GFP::LGG-1 and
mCherry::GFP::LGG-1 animals at the L4 stage or day1 adult stage were
anaesthetised in 0.1% sodium azide, and images were acquired using an Olympus
FV1000 or FV3000 confocal microscope. Using these images, GFP and/or mCherry
puncta in the anterior intestinal region or in the pharyngeal region were counted
and quantified. In each experiment, images from six to ten worms per condition
were captured and the experiments were repeated three times. For Rub-1::EGFP
and Q35::YFP worms, fluorescent images of the aligned whole worms on ice cold
empty plates were captured by stereomicroscope SZX16 equipped with DP80 CCD
camera (Olympus) and the number of polyQ aggregates per worms was counted.
Fly eye imaging. Light microscopic images of 1-day-old adult female flies were
taken using a stereoscopic microscope model SZX16 (Olympus) with a CCD
camera (DP22, Olympus). Numbers of necrotic patches per compound eye were
counted for each genotype.
Autophagic flux assay in Drosophila. To match the feeding status, 4-day-old flies
expressing GFP-mCherry-Atg8a either with or without dRubicon-IR under the da-
GAL4 driver were starved by 0.75% agar for 15 h and refed for 4 h. The brains were
dissected, fixed in 4% formalin in PBS, incubated with 80% glycerol overnight, and
then mounted with DAPI fluoromount-G (SouthernBiotech). Fluorescent images
of KC layer were taken by confocal microscope (Leica TCS SP8) and the number of
GFP and/or mCherry puncta in 25 × 50 μm ROI containing 150–200 cells were
counted. Three un-overlapping images were used for quantification of each KC
layers.
Stress resistance assay. Day1 adult worms were subjected to oxidative stress
(4.4 mM H2O2 in the empty plate) or heat stress (35 °C) for 3 h or 7 h, respectively
and the survived worms were counted. 30 worms were used per condition and the
experiments were repeated three times.
Western blotting. Worms or mouse tissues were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris/
HCl [pH 7.4], 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% NP-40, protease and phosphatase
inhibitor cocktail [Roche]) using a homogeniser. After centrifugation, the resultant
supernatants were subjected to protein quantification and western blotting. Protein
lysates of worm and mouse tissues were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to
PVDF membranes, which were then blocked and incubated with specific primary
antibodies. Primary antibodies and dilutions used for mouse tissues western
blotting were as follows: Rubicon (Cell Signalling Technology, #8465, 1:500), LC3
(Cell Signalling Technology, #2755, 1:1000), p62 (MBL, PM045, 1:1000), and β-
actin (Sigma Aldrich, A5316, 1:8000). In fly, to assess the total amount of dRu-
bicon, two fly bodies were lysed in 100 μl of 2 × SDS buffer (2% SDS, 125 mM Tris-
HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 20% Glycerol, 0.01% bromophenol blue, and 10% 2-Mer-
captoethanol). The lysates were heated at 99 °C for 10 min followed by cen-
trifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min and the supernatants were collected. The
protein lysates of 0.75 bodies per lane were separated by 5–12% polyacrylamide
gels, transferred to PVDF membranes. Blocking with 5% skim milk in PBS con-
taining 0.1% Tween 20. The antibodies used in this study were as follows: anti-
dRubicon (1:20,000), anti-actin (JLA20, 1:2,000, Developmental studies Hybridoma
Bank). Signal intensities were quantified by densitometry using ImageJ. Uncropped
images were provided in Supplementary Fig. 10.
Immunohistochemistry. For flies, adult female brains (3 days after eclosion) were
dissected, fixed in 4% formalin in PBS, blocked with 50% Block Ace (Dainippon
Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals) in PBS/T (0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS) and incubated
with an anti-HA antibody (3F10, 1:500, Sigma) to stain MJDtrQ78 protein with
HA-tag. The immunostainings were visualised with an Alexa 488-conjugated anti-
rat antibody and nuclei were stained with DAPI. Images of Kenyon cell layer (KC
layer) were taken by confocal microscopy (LSM780, Zeiss). Signal intensities of HA
staining were quantified using Image J 1.51 s software. Ten bilateral KC layers from
five animals were analysed for each group. For mice, immunohistochemical
staining for collagen I was performed on paraffin-embedded sections. After antigen
retrieval by autoclaving in 0.01 mmol/L citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for 10 min at 120 °C,
the sections were blocked with 3% BSA in PBS for 60 min. The blocked sections
were incubated with primary antibodies, anti-Collagen I (abcam, ab34710, 1:400) at
4 °C overnight, incubated for 30 min at room temperature, followed by detection
using a HRP-diaminobenzidine compound (Nichirei Corp.). Sections were coun-
terstained with hematoxylin.
Injection and detection of recombinant α-Syn Fibrils. Injection of fibrils and
their detection were described previously38,39. In brief, prepared fibrils were diluted
in sterile PBS and sonicated before intracerebral injection. Mice between 8 and
10 weeks of age were anaesthetised with chloral hydrate (250 mg/kg, i.p.) and
stereotaxically injected in both hemispheres (co-ordinates: + 0.2 mm relative to
Bregma, + 2.0 mm from midline) with recombinant α-Syn fibrils (1 µl of 1 mg/ml).
Animals were killed at 10 months after birth. Frozen brain sections including the
fibril-injected area were obtained using a CM3050S cryostat (Leica Biosystems).
Sections were incubated with mouse monoclonal antibody pSyn#64 (dilution,
1:1000, Wako Pure Chemical Industries), followed by Alexa Fluor 488–conjugated
