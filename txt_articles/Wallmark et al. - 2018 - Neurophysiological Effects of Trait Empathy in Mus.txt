The social cognitive basis of music processing has long been noted, and recent
research has shown that trait empathy is linked to musical preferences and listening
style. Does empathy modulate neural responses to musical sounds? We designed two
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments to address this question. In
Experiment 1, subjects listened to brief isolated musical timbres while being scanned.
In Experiment 2, subjects listened to excerpts of music in four conditions (familiar
liked (FL)/disliked and unfamiliar liked (UL)/disliked). For both types of musical stimuli,
emotional and cognitive forms of trait empathy modulated activity in sensorimotor and
cognitive areas: in the first experiment, empathy was primarily correlated with activity in
supplementary motor area (SMA), inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and insula; in Experiment 2,
empathy was mainly correlated with activity in prefrontal, temporo-parietal and reward
areas. Taken together, these findings reveal the interactions between bottom-up and
top-down mechanisms of empathy in response to musical sounds, in line with recent
findings from other cognitive domains.

INTRODUCTION
Music is a portal into the interior lives of others. By disclosing the affective and cognitive states of
actual or imagined human actors, musical engagement can function as a mediated form of social
encounter, even when listening by ourselves. It is commonplace for us to imagine music as a kind of
virtual ‘‘persona,’’ with intentions and emotions of its own (Watt and Ash, 1998; Levinson, 2006):
we resonate with certain songs just as we would with other people, while we struggle to identify
with other music. Arguing from an evolutionary perspective, it has been proposed that the efficacy
of music as a technology of social affiliation and bonding may have contributed to its adaptive
value (Cross, 2001; Huron, 2001). As Leman (2007) indicates: ‘‘Music can be conceived as a virtual
social agent . . . listening to music can be seen as a socializing activity in the sense that it may train
the listener’s self in social attuning and empathic relationships.’’ In short, musical experience and
empathy are psychological neighbors.
The concept of empathy has generated sustained interest in recent years among researchers
seeking to better account for the social and affective valence of musical experience (for
recent reviews see Clarke et al., 2015; Miu and Vuoskoski, 2017); it is also a popular
topic of research in social neuroscience (Decety and Ickes, 2009; Coplan and Goldie, 2011).
However, the precise neurophysiological relationship between music processing and empathy
remains unexplored. Individual differences in trait empathy modulate how we process social
stimuli—does empathy modulate music processing as well? If we consider music through

Trait Empathy in Music Listening
a social-psychological lens (North and Hargreaves, 2008;
Livingstone and Thompson, 2009; Aucouturier and Canonne,
2017), it is plausible that individuals with a greater dispositional
capacity to empathize with others might also respond to music-
as-social-stimulus differently on a neurophysiological level by
preferentially engaging brain networks previously found to be
involved in trait empathy (Preston and de Waal, 2002; Decety
and Lamm, 2006; Singer and Lamm, 2009). In this article,
we test this hypothesis in two experiments using functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In Experiment 1, we
explore the neural correlates of trait empathy (as measured using
the Interpersonal Reactivity Index) as participants listened to
isolated instrument and vocal tones. In Experiment 2, excerpts
of music in four conditions (familiar liked/disliked, unfamiliar
liked/disliked) were used as stimuli, allowing us to examine
correlations of neural activity with trait empathy in naturalistic
listening contexts.
Measuring Trait Empathy
Trait empathy refers to the capacity for empathic reactions
as a stable feature of personality. Individual differences in
trait empathy have been shown to correlate with prosocial
behavior (Litvack-Miller et al., 1997; Balconi and Canavesio,
2013) and situational, ‘‘state’’ empathic reactions to others
(Bufalari et al., 2007; Avenanti et al., 2009). Trait empathy is
commonly divided into two components: emotional empathy is
the often unconscious tendency to share the emotions of others,
while cognitive empathy is the ability to consciously detect and
understand the internal states of others (Goldman, 2011).
There are a number of scales to measure individual
differences in trait empathy currently in use, including the
Toronto Empathy Questionnaire (TEQ), Balanced Emotional
Empathy Scale (BEES), Empathy Quotient (EQ), Questionnaire
of Cognitive and Affective Empathy (QCAE) and Interpersonal
Reactivity Index (IRI). Here we use the IRI (Davis, 1980, 1996),
which is the oldest and most widely validated of these scales
and frequently used in neurophysiological studies of empathy
(Jackson et al., 2005; Gazzola et al., 2006; Pfeifer et al., 2008;
Avenanti et al., 2009; Christov-Moore and Iacoboni, 2016). The
IRI consists of 28 statements evaluated on a 5-point Likert
scale (from ‘‘does not describe me well’’ to ‘‘describes me
very well’’). It is subdivided into four subscales meant to tap
different dimensions of self-reported emotional and cognitive
empathy. Emotional empathy is represented by two subscales:
the empathic concern scale (hereafter EC) assesses trait-level
‘‘other-oriented’’ sympathy towards misfortunate others, and the
personal distress scale (PD) measures ‘‘self-oriented’’ anxiety and
distress towards misfortunate others. The two cognitive empathy
subscales consist of perspective taking (PT), or the tendency to
see oneself from another’s perspective, and fantasy (FS), the
tendency to imaginatively project oneself into the situations of
fictional characters.
Music and Empathy
Theories of empathy have long resonated with the arts. The father
of the modern concept of empathy, philosopher Theodor Lipps
(1907), originally devised the notion of Einfühlung (‘‘feeling
into’’) in order to explain aesthetic experience. Contemporary
psychological accounts have invoked mirror neurons as a
possible substrate supporting Lipps’s ‘‘inner imitation’’ theory
of the visual and performing arts (Molnar-Szakacs and Overy,
2006; Freedberg and Gallese, 2007). However, the incorporation
of psychological models of empathy in empirical music research
is still in its early stages. Empathy remains an ambiguous concept
in general (Batson, 2009), but applications to music can appear
doubly vexed. In an influential formulation, Eisenberg et al.
(1991) define empathy as, ‘‘an emotional response that stems
from another’s emotional state or condition and is congruent
with the other’s emotional state or condition.’’ Aspects of this
definition, though, might seem incongruous when applied to
music, which is inanimate and not capable of possessing an
emotional ‘‘state’’ (Davies, 2011). To connect music processing
to trait empathy, therefore, it is first necessary to determine the
extent to which music comprises a social stimulus. Who or what
do we empathize with when listening to music?
Scherer and Zentner (2001) proposed that empathy toward
music is often achieved via identification and sympathy
with
the
lived
experiences
and
expressive
intentions
of
composers and performers. Corroborating this view, in a
large web-based experiment Egermann and McAdams (2013)
found that ‘‘empathy for the musician’’ moderated between
recognized and induced emotions in music: the greater the
empathy, the more likely an individual was to exhibit a strong
affective response when listening. In a related study, Wöllner
(2012) presented participants with video of a string quartet
performance in three conditions—audio/visual, visual only, and
audio only—and reported a significant correlation between
trait empathy measures and perceived expressiveness in both
visual conditions (music-only condition was non-significant),
leading him to conclude: ‘‘since music is the audible outcome
of actions, empathic responses to the performer’s movements
may enhance the enjoyment of music.’’ Similarly, Taruffi
et al. (2017) found correlations between the EC and FS scales
of the IRI and accuracy in emotion recognition relative to
musicians’ self-reported expressive encodings in an audio-only
task.
A music-specific manifestation of trait empathy was proposed
by Kreutz et al. (2008), who defined ‘‘music empathizing’’ as
a cognitive style of processing music that privileges emotional
recognition and experience over the tendency to analyze and
predict the rules of musical structure (or, ‘‘music systematizing’’).
Garrido and Schubert (2011) compared this ‘‘music empathy’’
scale alongside the IRI-EC subscale in a study exploring
individual differences in preference for sad music. They found
that people who tend towards music empathizing are more
likely to enjoy sad music; however, high trait empathy was
not significantly correlated with enjoyment of sad music.
This would seem to suggest that the music empathizing
cognitive style differs from general trait empathy. A number
of other studies have investigated the relationship between
trait empathy and enjoyment of sad music using the IRI.
In a series of experiments, Vuoskoski and Eerola (2011),
Vuoskoski et al. (2012) and Eerola et al. (2016) reported
statistically significant correlations between EC and FS subscales

 Wallmark et al.
Trait Empathy in Music Listening
and self-reported liking for sad and tender music. Similarly,
Kawakami and Katahira (2015) found that FS and PT were
associated with preference for and intensity of emotional
reactions to sad music among children.
There is evidence that musical affect is often achieved through
mechanisms of emotional empathy (Juslin and Västfjäll, 2008).
According to this theory, composers and performers encode
affective gestures into the musical signal, and listeners decode
that signal by way of mimetic, mirroring processes; musical
expression is conveyed transparently as affective bodily motions
are internally reenacted in the listening process (Overy and
Molnar-Szakacs, 2009). Schubert (2017), in his Common Coding
Model of Prosocial Behavior Processing, suggests that musical
and social processing draw upon shared neural resources: music,
in this account, is a social stimulus capable of recruiting
empathy systems, including the core cingulate-paracingulate-
supplementary motor area (SMA)-insula network (Fan et al.,
2011), along with possible sensorimotor, paralimbic and limbic
representations. The cognitive empathy component, which can
be minimal, is involved primarily in detecting the aesthetic
context of listening, enabling the listener to consciously bracket
the experience apart from the purely social. This model may
help account for the perceived ‘‘virtuality’’ of musical experience,
whereby music is commonly heard as manifesting the presence
of an imagined other (Watt and Ash, 1998; Levinson, 2006).
In sum, trait empathy appears to modulate self-reported
affective
reactions
to
music.
There
is
also
peripheral
psychophysiological evidence that primed situational empathy
may increase emotional reactivity to music (Miu and Baltes
,,
2012). Following Schubert (2017), it is plausible that such a
relationship is supported by shared social cognitive mechanisms
that enable us to process music as a social stimulus; however,
this hypothesis has not yet been explicitly tested at the
neurophysiological level.
Neural Correlates of Trait Empathy
Corroborating the bipartite structure of trait empathy that
appears in many behavioral models of empathy, two interrelated
but distinct neural ‘‘routes’’ to empathy have been proposed
(Goldman, 2011), one associated with emotional contagion
and the other with cognitive perspective taking. Emotional
empathy is conceived as a bottom-up process that enables
‘‘feeling with someone else’’ through perception-action coupling
of affective cues (Preston and de Waal, 2002; Goldman, 2006).
Such simulation or ‘‘mirroring’’ models maintain that empathy is
subserved by the activation of similar sensorimotor, paralimbic
and limbic representations both when one observes another
and experiences the same action and emotional state oneself
(Gallese, 2003; Iacoboni, 2009). This proposed mechanism is
generally considered to be pre-reflective and phylogenetically
ancient; it has also been linked behaviorally to emotional
contagion, or the propensity to ‘‘catch’’ others’ feeling states
and unconsciously co-experience them (Hatfield et al., 1994).
For example, several imaging studies have found evidence for
shared representation of observed/experienced pain in anterior
cingulate and anterior insula (Singer et al., 2004; Decety and
Lamm, 2006; de Vignemont and Singer, 2006), as well as
somatosensory cortex (Bufalari et al., 2007). Similarly, disgust
for smells and tastes has been shown to recruit the insula
during both perception and action (Wicker et al., 2003; Jabbi
et al., 2007), and insula has been proposed as a relay between a
sensorimotor fronto-parietal circuit with mirror properties and
the amygdala in observation and imitation of emotional facial
expressions (Carr et al., 2003). There is also evidence that insula
functions similarly in music-induced emotions (Molnar-Szakacs
and Overy, 2006; Trost et al., 2015), particularly involving
negative valence (Wallmark et al., 2018).
In contrast to emotional empathy, trait cognitive empathy has
been conceived as a deliberative tendency to engage in top-down,
imaginative transpositions of the self into the ‘‘other’s shoes,’’
with concomitant reliance upon areas of the brain associated
with theory of mind (Saxe and Kanwisher, 2003; Goldman, 2006),
executive control (Christov-Moore and Iacoboni, 2016), and
contextual appraisal (de Vignemont and Singer, 2006), including
medial, ventral and orbital parts of the prefrontal cortex (PFC;
Chakrabarti et al., 2006; Banissy et al., 2012); anterior cingulate
(Singer and Lamm, 2009); somatomotor areas (Gazzola et al.,
2006); temporoparietal junction (TPJ; Lamm et al., 2011); and
precuneus/posterior cingulate (Chakrabarti et al., 2006). As
implied in the functional overlap between certain emotional
and cognitive empathy circuits, some have argued that the two
routes are neither hierarchical nor mutually exclusive (Decety
and Lamm, 2006): cognitive perspective taking is premised upon
emotional empathy, though it may, in turn, exert top-down
control over contagion circuits, modifying emotional reactivity
in light of contextual cues and more complex social appraisals
(Christov-Moore and Iacoboni, 2016; Christov-Moore et al.,
2017b).
Brain studies have converged upon the importance of the
human mirror neuron system in action understanding, imitation
and empathy (Iacoboni, 2009), and has been demonstrated in
multiple sensorimotor domains, including the perception of
action sounds (for a review see Aglioti and Pazzaglia, 2010).
Mirror properties were initially reported in the inferior frontal
gyrus (IFG) and the inferior parietal lobule (IPL; Iacoboni
et al., 1999; Shamay-Tsoory, 2010); consistent with simulation
theories of trait empathy, moreover, activity in these and other
sensorimotor mirror circuits has been found to correlate with
IRI scales in a variety of experimental tasks, including viewing
emotional facial expressions (all IRI scales; Pfeifer et al., 2008);
video of grasping actions (EC and FS; Kaplan and Iacoboni,
2006); and video of hands injected with a needle (PT and PD;
Bufalari et al., 2007; Avenanti et al., 2009). That is, high empathy
people tend to exhibit greater activation in mirror regions during
the observation of others. Simulation mechanisms also appear
to underpin prosocial decision-making (Christov-Moore and
Iacoboni, 2016; Christov-Moore et al., 2017b). Implication of
inferior frontal and inferior parietal mirror neuron areas is
not a universal finding in the empathy literature, and some
have suggested that it may reflect specific socially relevant tasks
or stimulus types, not empathy in and of itself (Fan et al.,
2011). However, evidence for mirror properties in single cells
of the primate brain now exists in medial frontal and medial
temporal cortex (Mukamel et al., 2010), dorsal premotor and

Trait Empathy in Music Listening
primary motor cortex (Tkach et al., 2007), lateral intraparietal
area (Shepherd et al., 2009), and ventral intraparietal area (Ishida
et al., 2009). This means that in brain imaging data the activity
of multiple brain areas may potentially be driven by cells with
mirror properties.
In addition to studies using visual tasks, auditory studies have
revealed correlations between mirror neuron activity and trait
empathy. Gazzola et al. (2006), for instance, reported increased
premotor and somatosensory activity associated with PT during
a manual action sound listening task. A similar link was
observed between IFG and PD scores while participants listened
to emotional speech prosody (Aziz-Zadeh et al., 2010). To
date, however, no studies have investigated whether individual
differences in empathy modulate processing of more socially
complex auditory stimuli, such as music.
Study Aim
To investigate the neural substrates underlying the relationship
between
trait
empathy
and
music,
we
carried
out
two
experiments using fMRI. In Experiment 1, we focused on a
single low-level attribute of musical sound—timbre, or ‘‘tone
color’’—to investigate the effects of empathy on how listeners
process isolated vocal and instrumental sounds outside of
musical context. We tested two main hypotheses: First, we
anticipated that trait empathy (measured with the IRI) would
be correlated with increased recruitment of empathy circuits
even when listening to brief isolated sounds out of musical
context (Gazzola et al., 2006). Second, following an embodied
cognitive view of timbre perception (Wallmark et al., 2018),
we hypothesized that subjectively and acoustically ‘‘noisy’’
timbral qualities would preferentially engage the emotional
empathy system among higher empathy listeners. Abrasive,
noisy acoustic features in human and many non-human
mammal vocalizations are often signs of distress, pain, or
aggression (Tsai et al., 2010): such state cues may elicit
heighted
responses
among
people
with
higher
levels
of
trait EC.
To explore the relationship between trait empathy and
music processing, in Experiment 2 participants passively listened
to excerpts of self-selected and experimenter-selected ‘‘liked’’
and ‘‘disliked’’ music in familiar and unfamiliar conditions
while being scanned. Musical preference and familiarity have
been shown to modulate neural response (Blood et al., 1999;
Pereira et al., 2011). Extending previous research on the neural
mechanisms of empathy, we predicted that music processing
would involve circuitry shared with empathic response in
non-musical contexts (Schubert, 2017). Unlike Experiment 1,
we had no a priori hypotheses regarding modulatory effects of
empathy specific to each of the four music conditions. However,
we predicted in both experiments that emotional empathy scales
(EC and PD) would be associated with regions of the emotional
empathy system in music listening, including sensorimotor,
paralimbic and limbic areas, while cognitive empathy scales (PT
and FS) would primarily be correlated with activity in prefrontal
areas implicated in previous cognitive empathy studies (Singer
and Lamm, 2009; imaging data for both experiments are available
online: see Supplementary Material S1 Dataset and S2 Dataset in
the online supporting information for NIFTI files of all contrasts
reported here).
EXPERIMENT 1
Methods
Subjects
Fifteen UCLA undergraduate students were recruited for
the study (eight female; 18–20 years old, M age = 19.1,
SD = 0.72). All were non-music majors; self-reported years
of musical training ranged from no experience to 10 years
(M = 3.27, SD = 1.44). Subjects were ethnically diverse
(six white, four east Asian, three south Asian, two black),
right-handed, normal or corrected-to-normal vision, and had
no history of neuropsychiatric disorder. All were paid $25 for
their participation. This study was carried out in accordance
with the recommendations of the UCLA Office of the Human
Research Protection Program with written informed consent
from all subjects. All subjects gave written informed consent
in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. No vulnerable
populations were involved as subjects in this research. The
protocol was approved following expedited review by the UCLA
Institutional Review Board in March 2012. The protocol expired
in March 2014 following all data gathering and a 1-year
renewal.
Stimuli
We recorded twelve approximately 2-s stimuli (1.8–2.1 s):
three electric guitar, three tenor saxophone, three shakuhachi
(Japanese bamboo flute), and three female vocals. For each
sound generator, signals were divided into ‘‘normal’’ and ‘‘noisy’’
versions: (1) normal condition; (2) noisy condition #1; and
(3) noisy condition #2. For example, the normal saxophone
condition (1) consisted of a regular tone, while noisy conditions
(2–3) were growled and overblown to create distortion, as shown
in the spectrographs of Figure 1. Noisy signals were characterized
acoustically by elevated inharmonicity, spectral centroid, spectral
flatness, zero-cross rate, and auditory roughness. Although
stimuli were conceived ordinally (normal, medium-noise, high-
noise), behavioral and neural evidence suggest that they are
perceived dichotomously (i.e., as either not noisy or noisy), as
reported in Wallmark et al. (2018). All signals were the same
pitch (233 Hz, B�3) and were manually equalized for loudness.
Stimuli were identical to those used in the other study: for
complete details, see Wallmark et al. (2018; see Supplementary
Material S1 Stimuli).
Behavioral Procedure
Fourteen of the fifteen subjects completed the IRI (Davis, 1980)
following the scan (one subject did not complete the IRI due
to scheduling conflicts). Additionally, in order to evaluate the
effect of noisiness levels on valence, subjects rated the stimuli on
three covarying perceptual scales using a 0–100 bipolar semantic
differential rating scale (Wallmark et al., 2018): (1) bodily
exertion required to produce each sound (‘‘low exertion-high
exertion’’), which is generally correlated with acoustic noise in

vocal sound production (Tsai et al., 2010); (2) negative valence
(‘‘like-dislike’’); and (3) perceived noisiness (‘‘not noisy-noisy’’).
Only 10 of the subjects were able to complete this ratings task,
also due to scheduling.
MRI Procedure
Subjects (N = 15) listened to the randomized stimuli while being
scanned. A sound check prior to the functional scan (conducted
with earplugs inserted and the scanner running) allowed subjects
to adjust the headphone volume to a subjectively determined
comfortable listening level. Participants were then instructed to
relax and keep their heads still while listening to the stimuli, and
to keep their eyes open and their vision trained on a fixation cross
presented through magnet-compatible LCD goggles.
We used a block design consisting of an alternation of
15–16 s baseline period of silence with randomized blocks of
all 12 stimuli. Each signal was repeated five times in a row with
100 ms of silence between each onset (9.4–10.9 s total per signal
in each block). The full block took approximately 135–140 s, and
was repeated three times for a total duration of 405–420 s plus
final baseline (around 7.25 m).
Data Acquisition, Preprocessing and Statistics
Images were acquired on a Siemens 3T Trio MRI scanner.
Functional runs employed a continuous scanning protocol
comprised 231 T2-weighted echoplanar images (EPIs; repetition
time (TR) 2000 ms; echo time (TE) 28 ms; flip angle = 90◦;
34 slices; slice thickness 4 mm; matrix 64 × 64; FOV
192 mm) sensitive to blood oxygenation-dependent (BOLD)
contrast. To enable T1 equilibrium the first two volumes
of each functional scan were automatically discarded before
data collection commenced. Additionally, two sets of structural
images were acquired for registration of functional data: a
T2-weighted matched-bandwidth high-resolution scan with
the same slice prescription as the EPI (TR 5000 ms; TE
34 ms; flip angle = 90◦; 34 slices; slice thickness 4 mm;
matrix 128 × 128; FOV 192 mm); and a T1 weighted
magnetization prepared rapid-acquisition gradient echo image
(MPRAGE; TR, 1900 ms; TE 2.26 ms; flip angle = 9◦;
176 sagittal slices; slice thickness 1 mm; matrix 256 × 256;
FOV 250 mm).
Image preprocessing and data analysis were performed
with FSL version 5.0.4. Images were realigned to the middle
volume to compensate for any head motion using MCFLIRT
(Jenkinson et al., 2002). Volumes were then examined manually
for gross motion artifacts that cannot be corrected with
simple realignment. When motion artifacts were detected, a
nuisance regressor for each affected volume was included in
the general linear model (GLM). One run for one subject
was excluded for excessive motion (more than 10% volumes
exhibiting motion artifacts). Data were temporally filtered with
a high-pass filter cutoff of 100 s and spatially smoothed with
a 8 mm full width half maximum Gaussian kernel in three
dimensions.
Statistical analyses were performed at the single-subject
level using a GLM with fMRI Expert Analysis Tool (FEAT,
version 6.00). Contrasts included the following: (1) all timbres
(task) > baseline; (2) each of the 12 individual stimuli > baseline;
(3) intra-instrument comparisons (e.g., Guitar 3 > Guitar 1);
(4) inter-timbre comparisons (e.g., all condition 3 > all condition
1); and (5) each instrument > others (e.g., voice > others).
Additionally,
conditions
1
and
2
were
combined
for
normal > noisy and noisy > normal comparisons. First-
level contrast estimates were computed for each run and then
registered to standard space (MNI) in three stages. The middle
volume of each run of individual EPI data was registered
first to the co-planar matched-bandwidth high-resolution
T2-weighted image. Following this, the co-planar volume was
registered to the T1-weighted MPRAGE. Both of these steps
were carried out using FLIRT (affine transformations: EPI to
co-planar, df = 6; co-planar to MPRAGE, df = 6; Jenkinson et al.,
2002). Registration of the MPRAGE to MNI space (FSL’s MNI
Avg152, T1 2 × 2 × 2 mm) was carried out with FLIRT (affine
transformation, df = 12). Contrast estimates for each subject
were then computed treating each of the three runs as a fixed
effect.
Next, group-level analysis was carried out using FSL FLAME
stage 1 and 2 (Beckmann et al., 2003). All images were
thresholded at Z > 2.3, p < 0.01, corrected for multiple

comparisons using cluster-based Gaussian random field theory
controlling family-wise error across the whole brain at p < 0.05
(Friston et al., 1994; Forman et al., 1995). In addition to
basic group-level contrasts, behavioral ratings were added as
continuous covariates to assess the neural correlates of the
four IRI scales. Due to moderate (though non-significant)
correlations between some of the scales, each of the four IRI
covariates were entered into separate second-level analyses.
Finally, to isolate regions of covarying activation that correspond
to the task, the region of activation from the task > baseline
contrast was used to mask the subsequent contrasts so
only regions that were also task positive by that criterion
showed.
Behavioral Results
Normality of the distribution of IRI and perceptual data was
confirmed (Shapiro-Wilk); to correct for violations in the
perceptual dataset, 5 of the 36 variables were transformed using
an inverse-normal procedure (Templeton, 2011). Scores for
the IRI subscales were then compared using repeated-measures
analysis of variance (ANOVA). The test revealed a significant
difference between the four scales, F(3,39) = 18.28, p < 0.0001,
η2
p = 0.58; post hoc testing (Bonferroni) found that mean PD
scores were significantly lower than the other three scales.
However, subscales were only modestly reliable (M Cronbach’s
α = 0.54). The four scales were not significantly correlated with
one another.
To verify whether there was a reliable difference in valence
ratings between normal and noisy stimuli, we performed
another repeated-measures ANOVA on perceptual ratings data
(3 × 4 × 2 design with three perceptual conditions, four sound
generators and binary timbral noisiness levels (normal condition
1 and noisy conditions 2 + 3/2)). As expected, no significant main
effects of the perceptual scales were revealed (bodily exertion,
negative valence, noisiness), F(2,12) = 0.6, p = 0.94, η2
p = 0.01,
indicating that all three tapped a similar affective structure (for
this reason, only valence was included in subsequent analyses).
The main effect of sound generator was significant, F(3,18) = 3.34,
p = 0.04, η2
p = 0.34; timbral noisiness also had a large effect on
ratings, F(2,12) = 7.51, p < 0.01, η2
p = 0.56, with ‘‘noisier’’ timbres
rated significantly lower than the normal condition. Two-way
interactions between perceptual categories∗sound generator and
sound generator∗timbral noisiness were likewise significant
(p < 0.05), and appear to have been driven by the electric
guitar and the female voice, which did not differ in bodily
exertion and noisiness means but crossed substantially in
negative valence and timbral noisiness (voice was perceived as
being significantly noisier and more negatively valenced than
guitar).
Since many studies have shown a gender difference in IRI
scores (Mehrabian et al., 1988; Davis, 1996), we next tested
for a behavioral and neural effect of gender on trait empathy.
Females showed significantly higher EC scores than males,
t(13) = 5.44, p < 0.0001, Cohen’s d = 2.91; no other subscales
were significantly different between the sexes. To investigate
the possible effect of gender EC differences on imaging results
(Derntl et al., 2010), we added sex as a covariate in another
second-level analysis. The analysis revealed increased activation
of the brain stem among females compared to males in the
task > baseline contrast, which is consistent with other studies
(Filkowski et al., 2017). However, this result did not survive
masking for the task. No other significant differences were
found. The same confirmatory analysis was carried out in
Experiment 2, which also yielded no significant sex differences
aside from EC. Though the sample size for this comparison
was small, we concluded for the sake of this study that
sex was not a significant neurophysiological factor in music
processing.
Imaging Results
We
evaluated
the
effect
of

on
the
processing
of
musical
timbre
in
three
basic
conditions:
(1) task > baseline (i.e., sound > silence); (2) positively
valenced (normal) > negatively valenced (noisy) timbres; and
(3) noisy > normal timbres. Results for these three contrasts
are organized according to IRI subscales in Table 1. With trait
empathy scores added as covariates to our model, we found
that neural responses to the valence of timbre are differentiated
by IRI subscale. PT was associated with activation in bilateral
sensorimotor areas when listening to aggregated timbres
(task > baseline), including SMA and anterior cingulate (ACC),
primary motor cortex and primary somatosensory cortex (SI),
as shown in Figure 2. FS also involved SMA activation in
the task > baseline contrast, in addition to ventrolateral PFC
(VLPFC). FS scores were correlated with both directions of
the valence contrast: normal timbres modulated activity in left
TPJ, inferior/middle frontal gyrus (IFG/MFG) and anterior
insula cortex (AIC), while noisy timbres preferentially engaged
medial prefrontal (MPFC/VMPFC) and temporal areas, as well
as precuneus (PCUN). Both directions of valence modulated
activity in IPL.
On the emotional empathy scales, we found that in the
task > baseline contrast EC modulated activity in a wide
swath of bilateral motor (SMA, IPL, IFG), auditory (STG), and
somatosensory (SI and SII) areas, in addition to cerebellum and
AIC. Some of this sensorimotor activity corresponds to areas also
implicated in PT. EC was also correlated with activation of SMA
in the noisy > normal contrast, indicating a motor component
in the processing of aversive sounds among listeners with higher
emotional empathy. PD was not significantly correlated with
BOLD signal change in any of the contrasts.
In sum, Experiment 1 demonstrated that trait empathy is
correlated with increased activation of circuitry often associated
with emotional contagion, including sensorimotor areas and
insula, in the perception of isolated musical timbres. FS and
EC also appear to be sensitive to the affective connotations
of the stimuli. Timbre is arguably the most basic and quickly
processed building block of music (Tervaniemi et al., 1997).
Though sufficient to recruit empathy areas, these brief stimuli
do not, however, constitute ‘‘music’’ per se. In Experiment 2,
we turned our focus to more naturalistic stimuli—including
excerpts of music selected in advance by participants—in order
to explore the effect of trait empathy on the processing of
music.

EXPERIMENT 2
Methods
Subjects
Twenty
UCLA
undergraduates
(13
female,
seven
males;
18–20 years old, M age = 19.1, SD = 0.72) with a range of musical
backgrounds were recruited (all non-music-majors; M years
musical training = 5, SD = 3.78). Subjects were ethnically diverse
(seven white, five east Asian, four south Asian, two Hispanic,
two black), right-handed, normal or corrected-to-normal vision,
and had no history of neuropsychiatric disorder. Ten of the
subjects also participated in Experiment 1. To ensure that only
individuals with strong musical preferences enrolled in the
study, we specified in recruitment materials that interested
individuals must regularly experience ‘‘intense positive and
negative emotions when listening to music.’’ Subjects were paid
$50 for their participation. The experiment was approved by the
UCLA IRB.
Stimuli
Stimuli consisted of sixteen 16-s excerpts of recorded music,
half of which were individually selected in pre-scan meetings
with each participant. Because musical preference (i.e., liking or
disliking) and familiarity have been shown to modulate neural
response (Blood et al., 1999; Pereira et al., 2011), we decided
to subdivide stimuli into four categories: familiar liked (FL),
familiar disliked (FD), unfamiliar liked (UL) and unfamiliar
disliked (UD). For FL excerpts, subjects brought us four songs

they ‘‘love’’ and, for FD, four songs they ‘‘hate.’’ During the
meeting and over follow-up communications with subjects, we
collaboratively defined the ‘‘best’’ (or ‘‘worst’’) part of each song
for use in the scanner, which typically corresponded to the
chorus, the beginning of the first verse, or the introduction. Prior
to the scan, all excerpts were approved by the subjects as an
accurate reflection of their musical ‘‘loves’’ and ‘‘hates.’’
The other eight stimuli were selected by the researchers,
in consultation with a popular music scholar at UCLA, to
match the two categories of self-selected music with UL
and UD excerpts. Selections were based on three general
criteria: (1) they should roughly match the stylistic and
generic
features
of
the
familiar
songs;
(2)
they
should
take into account additional comments relating to musical
tastes and affective orientations made by subjects during the
meeting; and (3) they should be relatively obscure to typical
undergraduate non-music majors, so that the in-scanner hearing
represents subjects’ first exposure to the song (for a complete
list of stimuli used in the experiment, see Supplementary
Material S2 Table 1).
All audio files were trimmed to representative 16-s excerpts
with 500-ms amplitude ramps on either end of the signal.
Loudness was equalized manually. Control conditions were 16 s
of silence (eight times during the MRI run) and a 16-s clip of pink
noise (eight times).
Procedure
The MRI procedure was similar to Experiment 1. Subjects
(N = 20) were instructed to passively listen to the randomized
stimuli while being scanned. We employed a block design in
which each stimulus was presented once, with 16-s baseline
silence or noise between each musical excerpt. The full scan took
approximately 9 min, following which 19 subjects completed the
IRI questionnaire in a quiet room. Sixteen of the participants
also rated their preference for the self- and researcher-selected
excerpts using a 0–100 horizontal numbered bipolar scale
(‘‘strongly dislike-strongly like’’).
MRI data acquisition, preprocessing, and statistics were
identical to Experiment 1. Contrasts included: (1) each
category > baseline silence and noise (e.g., FL > silence/noise);
(2) inter-categorical contrasts (e.g., FD > FL); (3) cross-
categorical contrasts (e.g., FL > UL); (4) aggregate contrasts
(e.g., L > D); and (5) interactions. As in Experiment 1, all images
were thresholded at Z > 2.3 (p < 0.01), corrected for multiple
comparisons across the whole brain at p < 0.05. IRI ratings were
added as covariates in four separate analyses, and the region of

activation from the task > baseline contrast was used to mask the
subsequent contrasts so only regions that were also task positive
by that criterion showed.
Behavioral Results
We first examined differences between IRI scales and preference
ratings in the four stimuli conditions. A test for normality of
distribution (Shapiro-Wilk) resulted in the transformation of
data for two IRI scales and two preference ratings (Templeton,
2011). Preference ratings for one subject were omitted as an
outlier based on a criterion of ±2 SDs from the mean. As in
Experiment 1, repeated-measure ANOVA revealed a significant
difference between IRI subscales, F(3,54) = 28.33, p < 0.0001,
η2
p = 0.61, and as anticipated, in a post hoc test (Bonferroni) PD
was found to differ significantly from the others (all p < 0.05).
The four subscales registered acceptable internal consistency
(M Cronbach’s α = 0.65), and were not significantly correlated
after correcting for multiple comparisons (False Discovery
Rate method; see Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995). To confirm
main effects of the four familiarity/valence conditions on mean
preference ratings, we ran another repeated-measure ANOVA,
which revealed a large main effect, F(3,45) = 152.93, p < 0.0001,
η2
p = 0.91. Significance of all pairwise comparisons was confirmed
at p < 0.0001 (Bonferroni; see Supplementary Material S2 Table
2 for descriptive statistics of Experiment 2 behavioral data).
PT, FS and PD were not strongly associated with the
preference ratings, but, as shown in Figure 3, EC showed strong
correlations with preference for FL music, r(14) = 0.70, p < 0.01;
FD, r(14) = −0.64, p = 0.02; liked music (i.e., both familiar and
unfamiliar), r(14) = 0.57, p = 0.03; and unfamiliar music (both
liked and disliked), r(14) = 0.56, p = 0.03, significance levels
adjusted for multiple comparisons (False Discovery Rate). The
correlation between empathy and liking of unfamiliar music
suggests that empathic people in our sample were more likely
to be affectively open-minded to new music, even excerpts they
disliked.
Imaging Results
In the basic group-level analysis (no empathy covariates),
we found the involvement of left ventral pallidum (VP) and
thalamus in musical liking (L > D). This result is consistent with
previous research on the neurophysiology of musical preference,
which has broadly confirmed the role of basal ganglia reward
circuitry in musical pleasure (Blood et al., 1999; Salimpoor
et al., 2013). In contrast, musical disliking (D > L) was
accompanied by activity in right AIC, MPFC, OFC, superior
temporal gyrus (STG) and amygdala/parahippocampus. AIC
has been implicated in most emotional empathy studies; it
has also been found to contribute to both positive (Koelsch
et al., 2006) and negative reactions to musical stimuli (Wallmark
et al., 2018). Amygdala and OFC are also often involved in
negative affect (Phan et al., 2002), and connectivity between
these two areas is indicative of emotional regulation (Banks
et al., 2007). Moreover, lateralization of affective response—left
with positive, right with negative—is also consistent with other
studies (Hellige, 1993). Finally, unfamiliar music was associated
with enhanced activation of bilateral superior frontal gyrus
FIGURE 3 | Correlations between EC and musical preference: (1) ratings for
familiar liked (FL) excerpts; (2) ratings for familiar disliked (FD) music; (3) ratings
for all liked excerpts (familiar and unfamiliar); and (4) ratings for all unfamiliar
music (liked and disliked).
(SFG) compared to familiar—possibly indicating heightened
attention—while familiar music involved the contribution of
a dense network of areas across the whole brain, including
bilateral IPL, anterior cingulate and paraginculate, premotor
cortex, SMA, medial prefrontal areas, and cerebellum (Janata
et al., 2007; Pereira et al., 2011). Figure 4 displays results for
these four basic contrasts (see also Supplementary Material
S2 Table 3).
With IRI covariates added in a second-level analysis, we
found neural signatures distinctive to all subscales. As shown
in Table 2, PT was associated with activity in the left TPJ in
response to the task. Familiar liked music covaried with PT in
cerebellum, TPJ, SFG and the posterior part of the cingulate
(PCC) compared to FD music; further, in comparison with
UL music, FL showed increased activation in a large region of
the right PFC. A significant interaction effect between liking
and familiarity was observed in the right dorsolateral PFC
(DLPFC). In contrast, FS exhibited significant correlations with
activity in dorsal striatum and limbic areas—including caudate,
putamen, thalamus, fornix, hippocampus and amygdala—as a
function of musical familiarity (F > U) and liking (FL > UL).
Activations for IRI covariates in selected contrasts are shown in
Figure 5.
EC also showed sensitivity to familiarity, which was correlated
with activity in dorsomedial PFC (extending ventrally to
paracingulate), IPL, DLPFC and IFG, cerebellum, visual areas
(lingual gyrus and occipital pole), dorsal striatum, VMPFC,
VLPFC and amygdala in the F > U contrast. This strong
familiarity effect could also be seen in a number of other

contrasts, including FL > FD, which showed a correlation with
activity in middle temporal gyrus; FL > UL, which added activity
in right posterior IFG; and the interaction between liking and
familiarity. Additionally, EC revealed some rare correlations with
disliked music, including the head of the caudate in the FD > UD
contrast, as well as DLPFC in the UD > UL contrast. Finally, the
PD scale was associated with activation in the right MFG in the
FD > UD contrast. This was the only significant result for this
subscale in either experiment.
DISCUSSION
The
present
study
demonstrates
that
trait
empathy

correlated

differences
in
music
processing. Music has long been conceived as a social stimulus
(North and Hargreaves, 2008; Livingstone and Thompson, 2009;
Aucouturier and Canonne, 2017). Supporting this view, our
study offers novel evidence that neural circuitry involved in trait
empathy is active to a greater degree in empathic individuals
during perception of both simple musical tones and full musical
excerpts. Individual variances in empathy are reflected in
differential recruitment of core empathy networks (Fan et al.,
2011) during music listening; specifically, IRI subscales were
found to correlate with activity in regions associated with both
emotional (e.g., sensorimotor regions, insular and cingulate
cortex) and cognitive empathy (e.g., PFC, TPJ) during passive
listening tasks.
Our main hypotheses were confirmed, though with an
unexpected twist regarding the two putative empathy types
(at least as structured by the IRI). Both experiments seem to
suggest interactions between bottom-up and top-down processes
(indexed in our study by both IRI scores and activity in neural
systems) in empathy-modulated music listening. This is in
line with recent findings in prosocial decision making studies
(Christov-Moore and Iacoboni, 2016; Christov-Moore et al.,
2017a,b). Stimulus type, however, seems associated with different
patterns of neural systems engagement. In Experiment 1,
sensorimotor areas were more frequently modulated by trait
empathy in the processing of musical timbre; conversely, in
Experiment 2, cognitive areas were more frequently modulated
by trait empathy in the processing of (familiar) music. Together
this suggests that, contrary to our initial hypothesis for
Experiment 2, modulation of neural activity by empathy was
driven more by stimulus type than by empathy type; that is,
the emotional empathy subscale (EC) was no more selective to
emotional contagion circuitry than cognitive empathy scales (PT
and FS), and vice versa (the PD scale did not reveal any significant
correlations with brain activity). In what follows, we interpret
these results and discuss their implications.

taking (PT) was correlated with activity in motor areas (SMA
and primary motor cortex), SI and anterior cingulate (ACC).
This finding is in line with numerous studies suggesting a role
for ACC and SI in emotional empathy (Bufalari et al., 2007;

et al. (2006), who reported a correlation of somatomotor activity
and PT scores in an action sound listening task. Activity in
these regions may suggest a sensorimotor simulation process
whereby high-PT individuals imitate internally some aspect of
the production of these sounds. This result could be explained
in light of Cox’s (2016) ‘‘mimetic hypothesis,’’ according to
which music is understood by way of covert or overt motor
reenactments of sound-producing physical gestures. It is quite
conceivable that people who are inclined to imagine themselves
from others’ perspectives also tend to take up the physical
actions implied by others’ musical sounds, whether a smooth and
gentle voice, a growled saxophone, or any other musical sound
reflecting human actions. It is intriguing, however, that PT was
not implicated in the processing of positive or negative valence.
One might assume that perspective takers possess a neural
preference for ‘‘good’’ sounds: for example, one study reported
activation of larynx control areas in the Rolandic operculum
while subjects listened to pleasant music (but not unpleasant),
suggesting subvocalization only to positively valenced music
(Koelsch et al., 2006). Our results, however, indicate that PT is
not selective to valence in these sensorimotor areas.

in
the
task > baseline contrast. Unlike PT, FS appeared to be sensitive
to both positive and negative valence of timbres: we found
activity in left TPJ and Broca’s area of the IFG associated with
positively valenced timbres, and temporal, parietal and prefrontal
activations associated with disliked timbres. TPJ is an important
structure for theory of mind (Saxe and Kanwisher, 2003; Young
et al., 2010). Together with Broca’s area—a well-studied language
and voice-specific motor region (Watkins and Paus, 2004; Brown
et al., 2008) that has been implicated in emotional empathy (Fan
et al., 2011; Cheetham et al., 2014)—it is plausible to suggest
that individuals who are prone to fantasizing may exhibit a
greater tendency to attribute mental states to the virtual human
agents responsible for making musical sounds, and that this
attribution would be more pronounced for positively valenced
stimuli (Warren et al., 2006).
As hypothesized, EC was correlated with activation in a range
of areas previously implicated in empathy studies, including
IPL, IFG and SMA, along with SI, STG, cerebellum and AIC
(Iacoboni, 2009). It was also sensitive to negative valence: noisy
timbres were processed with greater involvement from SMA in
individuals with higher EC. EC is an ‘‘other-oriented’’ emotional
scale measuring sympathy or compassion towards the misfortune
of others (Batson, 1991; Davis, 1996). Since noisy, distorted
qualities of vocal timbre are an index of generally high-arousal,

 Wallmark et al.
Trait Empathy in Music Listening
negatively valenced affective states (Tsai et al., 2010), we theorize
that individuals with higher trait EC exhibited greater motor
attunement owing to the ecological urgency typically signaled
by such sound events. In short, we usually deploy harsh vocal
timbres when distressed or endangered (e.g., screaming or
shouting), not during affectively positive or neutral low-arousal
states, and high-empathy people are more likely to pick up
on and simulate the affective motor implications of others in
distress. Though our sensitivity to the human voice is especially
acute (Belin et al., 2000), researchers have hypothesized that
instrumental timbre can similarly function as a ‘‘superexpressive
voice’’ via acoustic similarities to emotional vocal expression
(Juslin and Västfjäll, 2008). Our result would seem to support this
theory, as motor response appears to encode the combined effects
of noisy tones, both vocal and instrumental.
It is also worth noting, as might be expected given the
above, that noisy voice produced a unique signature of activation
among high FS and EC participants relative to the normal vocal
stimuli (Supplementary Material S1 Figure 1; Supplementary
Material S1 Tables 1, 2): FS modulated processing of the
noisy voice in SII and IPL, while EC was selective to noisy
vocal sounds in the SMA and primary motor cortex. This
result appears to be at odds with other studies of vocal affect
sensitivity that report motor-mimetic selectivity for pleasant
vocalizations (Warren et al., 2006; Wallmark et al., 2018). It is
likely that individual variances in empathy (plus other mediating
factors) predispose listeners to differing orientations towards
others’ affective vocalizations, with empathic listeners more
likely to ‘‘catch’’ the motor-affective implications of aversive
sounds than low-empathy people, who might only respond to
sounds they find pleasant while tuning out negatively valenced
vocalizations. Cox (2016) theorizes that music can afford
listeners an ‘‘invitation’’ for motor engagement, which they may
choose to accept or decline. Seen from this perspective, it is
likely that individual differences in empathy play an important
role in determining how we choose to respond to music’s motor
invitations.
Regarding motor engagement, across IRI subscales it is
apparent that SMA is the most prominent sensorimotor area
involved in empathy-modulated processing of timbre. SMA
is a frequently reported yet undertheorized part of the core
empathy network (Fan et al., 2011); it has also been implicated
in internally generated movement and coordination of action
sequences (Nguyen et al., 2014), and has been shown in a
single-neuron study to possess mirror properties (Mukamel
et al., 2010). Most relevant to the present study, moreover,
SMA contributes to the vividness of auditory imagery, including
imagery for timbre (Halpern et al., 2004; Lima et al., 2015).
Halpern et al. (2004) attributed SMA activity in an auditory
imagery task in part to subvocalization of timbral attributes,
and the present study would seem to partially corroborate this
explanation. We interpret this result as a possible instance of
sensorimotor integration: SMA activity could reflect a basic
propensity to link sounds with their associated actions, which
are internally mirrored while listening. In accordance with this
view, we would argue that people do not just passively listen
to different qualities of musical timbre—they enact some of the
underlying physical determinants of sound production, whether
through subvocalization (Halpern et al., 2004), biography specific
act-sound associations (Bangert et al., 2006; Margulis et al., 2009),
or other theorized mechanisms of audio-motor coupling (Cox,
2016).
To summarize, sensorimotor areas have been implicated in
many previous studies of emotional empathy, including IFG and
IPL (Carr et al., 2003; Shamay-Tsoory, 2010); ‘‘pain circuit’’ areas
in AIC and ACC (Singer et al., 2004; Shamay-Tsoory, 2010);
and somatomotor regions (i.e., pre/primary motor cortices and
SI/SII; Carr et al., 2003; Gazzola et al., 2006; Pfeifer et al.,
2008). Interestingly, these precise regions dominated results of
the Experiment 1 timbre listening task. This is true, moreover,
for both emotional and cognitive scales: PT and FS, though
often implicated in cognitive tasks (Banissy et al., 2012), were
found in this experiment to modulate SMA, SI, primary motor
cortex, IPL, AIC and IFG, well-documented motor-affective
areas. We theorize that the contextual impoverishment and
short duration of the timbre listening task (2-s isolated tones)
may have largely precluded any genuine perspective taking or
fantasizing from occurring—it is much harder to put oneself in
the ‘‘shoes’’ of an single isolated voice or instrument, of course,
than it is an affectively rich piece of actual music. However,
even in the absence of conscious cognitive empathizing, which
presumably would have been reflected in engagement of the
cognitive empathy system, individuals with high trait PT and FS
still showed selective activations of sensorimotor and affective
relay circuits typically associated with emotional empathy. This
could be interpreted to suggest that the two ‘‘routes’’ to empathy
are not dissociated in music listening: although conscious PT in
response to abbreviated auditory cues is unlikely, people who
frequently imagine themselves in the positions of others also
exhibit a tendency toward motor resonance in this basic listening
task, even when musical context is missing.
Prefrontal and Reward Activation During
Music Listening
Experiment 2 used 16-s excerpts of self- and experimenter-
selected music to explore the effect of dispositional empathy
on the processing of music in four conditions, familiar
liked (FL), familiar disliked (FD), unfamiliar liked (UL), and
unfamiliar disliked (UD). Participants consisted of individuals
who reported regularly experiencing intense emotional reactions
while listening to music. Musical liking is associated at the group
level (i.e., no IRI covariates) with left basal ganglia reward areas,
and disliking with activity in right AIC, primary auditory cortex
and prefrontal areas (OFC and VLPFC). Musical familiarity is
associated with activation across a broad region of the cortex,
subcortical areas, and cerebellum, including IPL, premotor
cortex and the core empathy network (Fan et al., 2011), while
unfamiliarity recruits only the SFG. This robust familiarity effect
is even more acute among high-empathy listeners: after adding
empathy covariates to our analysis, there were no regions that
demonstrated an affect-specific response after controlling for
familiarity. This result is consistent with the literature in showing
a large neurophysiological effect of familiarity on musical liking

 Wallmark et al.
Trait Empathy in Music Listening
(Pereira et al., 2011); it appears that trait empathy, as well,
modulates responses to familiar music to a greater degree than
unfamiliar music.
Contrary to expectations, activation in regions primarily
associated with emotional empathy (e.g., sensorimotor areas,
ACC, AIC) was not a major component in empathy-modulated
music processing. Instead, the most prominent activation sites
for PT and EC scales were prefrontal, including medial, lateral,
and orbital portions of the cortex, as well as TPJ. These
regions are involved in executive control, regulation of emotions,
mentalizing, contextual appraisal, and ‘‘enactment imagination’’
(Goldman, 2006), and have figured prominently in many studies
on the neurophysiology of cognitive empathy (Decety and
Grèzes, 2006; Frith and Frith, 2006). Additionally, FS and EC
results were characterized by dorsal striatum when participants
listened to familiar music. This basal ganglia structure has been
frequently reported in empathy studies but not often discussed
(Fan et al., 2011); it has also long been associated with musical
pleasure (Blood et al., 1999; Salimpoor et al., 2011, 2013).
Replicating this association, our results suggest that empathic
people experience a higher degree of reward and motivation
when listening to familiar music compared to lower-empathy
people.
PT was associated with left TPJ in the task > baseline contrast.
Activation of this region among perspective-takers is consistent
with studies implicating TPJ in theory of mind (Saxe and
Kanwisher, 2003) and the merging of self and other (Lawrence
et al., 2006). The TPJ was joined by posterior cingulate,
cerebellum and superior prefrontal areas when listening to
familiar liked music (FL > FD), the former two of which were
also identified in a study on the neural bases of perspective
taking (Jackson et al., 2006). Interestingly, these results differ
substantially from the PT correlations in Experiment 1, which
were entirely sensorimotor. In the context of isolated musical
sounds, PT results were interpreted as a reflection of covert
imitation (or, enactive perspective taking): in contrast, however,
it appears here that PT may reflect a more cognitively mediated,
mental form of perspective taking, which conceivably extends
beyond action-perception coupling of musicians’ affective motor
cues to encompass contextual appraisal, assessments of the
affective intent embodied in the music, and other executive
functions.
In contrast to the prominent TPJ and prefrontal activation
associated with PT, FS results revealed activation of dorsal
striatum (caudate and putamen) and limbic areas (thalamus,
hippocampus and amygdala). Activation of reward and emotion
centers may suggest that fantasizers also tend to exhibit
heightened positive emotional reactions to familiar music.
Indeed, we found a moderate correlation between FS and
preference ratings for familiar liked music, r(14) = 0.52, which
may tentatively corroborate this claim. Moreover, structural
brain studies have found that FS is associated with increased
gray matter volume in hippocampus (Cheetham et al., 2014),
an important memory area, perhaps also indicating enhanced
encoding of familiar liked music among fantasizers.
The contrast in activation between the two IRI cognitive
empathy scales (PT and FS) is notable, and may be attributed
to the different aspects of empathy they were designed to assess.
PT taps the tendency to imagine oneself in other people’s shoes,
whereas FS captures the tendency to imagine oneself from the
perspective of fictional characters (Davis, 1980, 1996). With this
distinction in mind, one could surmise that the two scales also
tap different views regarding the ontology of the musical agent:
in this reading, people with high trait PT are more likely to
take music as a social stimulus, i.e., as if it was a real or virtual
human presence (with theory of mind, goals, beliefs), while high
FS listeners are more likely to hear it as ‘‘fictional’’ from a
social perspective, i.e., as a rewarding sensory stimulus with an
attenuated grip on actual social cognition. Further research is
called for to explore possible explanations for the differences in
cognitive scales as reflected in music listening.
Turning finally to emotional empathy, we found that EC
recruits prefrontal, reward and sensorimotor-affective areas in
music listening, and is likewise quite sensitive to familiarity.
In the Familiar > Unfamiliar contrast, we found activation
of cerebellum, IPL, DLPFC, IFG, DMPFC, amygdala, anterior
paracingulate, dorsal striatum, OFC and lingual gyrus, and
a variation on this general pattern for the Familiar liked >
Unfamiliar liked and interaction contrasts. Activation of bilateral
IPL and IFG is consistent with mirror accounts of empathy
(Shamay-Tsoory, 2010). Furthermore, the ACC, paracingulate,
and areas that extend dorsally (SMA, DMPFC) have been
proposed as the core of the empathy network (Fan et al., 2011):
our result would seem to extend support for the primacy of
this region using an experimental task that is not explicitly
social in the manner of most empathy studies. Lastly, DLPFC
is an important executive control area in cognitive empathy
(Christov-Moore and Iacoboni, 2016), and has been implicated
in emotional regulation (Ochsner et al., 2004; Quirk and
Beer, 2006). Activation of this region may reflect top-down
control over affective responses to familiar music, both in
terms of up-regulation to liked music and down-regulation
to disliked (or possibly up-regulation to negative stimuli, as
open-minded empathic listeners try to ‘‘see something positive’’
in the disliked music). In further research, connectivity analysis
between DLPFC and limbic/reward areas may help to specify the
neurophysiological mechanisms underlying empathy-modulated
emotional regulation during music listening.
In addition to motor, cingulate and prefrontal activity, we
found the recruitment of emotion and reward processing areas
as a function of EC and musical familiarity: dorsal striatum
(the whole extent of the caudate nucleus, plus thalamus) may
reflect increased pleasure in response to familiar music among
empathic listeners. It is not surprising that the reward system
would show preferential activation to familiar music (Pereira
et al., 2011), as confirmed in the basic group Liked > Disliked
contrast. Prevalence of basal ganglia for both EC and FS suggests
that trait empathy may effectively sensitize people to the music
they already know. This even appears to be the case for disliked
music, which showed dorsal striatum activation (along with
OFC) in the Familiar disliked > Unfamiliar disliked contrast.
This could be interpreted to indicate that empathic people may
experience heightened musical pleasure even when listening to
the music they self-select as ‘‘hating,’’ provided it is familiar. By

 Wallmark et al.
Trait Empathy in Music Listening
way of contrast, no striatum activation was found for any of the
unfamiliar music conditions. In concert with limbic circuitry,
then, it is apparent that musical familiarity recruits a broad region
of the affect-reward system in high EC listeners.
Activation of inferior parts of the lingual gyrus and occipital
lobe was another novel finding, and may also be linked to
musical affect. These areas are associated with visual processing,
including perception and recognition of familiar sights and
emotional facial expressions (Kitada et al., 2010), as well as visual
imagery (Kosslyn et al., 2001). It is reasonable to think that
empathic listeners may be more prone to visual imagery while
listening to familiar music. Visual responses are an important
mechanism of musical affect more generally, and are a fairly
reliable index of musical engagement and attention (Juslin and
Västfjäll, 2008): if high-EC people are more susceptible to
musical affect, as suggested by our results, they may also show
a greater tendency towards visual imagery in music listening. To
be clear, we did not explicitly operationalize visual imagery in
this study: in the future, it would be interesting to follow up on
this result by comparing visual imagery and music listening tasks
using the EC scale as a covariate.
The behavioral data resonate in interesting and sometimes
contradictory ways with these imaging findings. We found
that EC is strongly associated with preference for liked music
and unfamiliar music, and negative responses to familiar
disliked music. Results suggest that high-EC people are more
responsive to the affective components of music, as reflected
in polarity of preference responses. EC was also associated
with open-mindedness to new music (i.e., higher ratings for
unfamiliar music), though imaging results for this contrast did
not reach significance, and might appear to be contradicted by
the clear familiarity effect discussed previously. We must be
cautious in the interpretation of these findings owing to the small
sample size, but this resonance between behavioral and imaging
evidence is nonetheless suggestive in demonstrating a role for EC
in affective responsiveness to familiar music. This conclusion is
broadly consistent with previous behavioral studies (Egermann
and McAdams, 2013), especially regarding pleasurable responses
to sad music (Garrido and Schubert, 2011; Vuoskoski et al., 2012;
Eerola et al., 2016).
In sum, the present results provide complementary neural
evidence that involvement of prefrontal areas and limbic/basal
ganglia in music listening covaries with individual trait
differences in empathy, with sensorimotor engagement playing a
smaller role. How do we account for the prominence of cognitive,
prefrontal areas in music listening but not musical timbre in
isolation? It must be noted that a broad swath of the emotional
empathy system was involved in the basic task > baseline
contrast (used to mask all IRI covariates): in other words, it
is clear that music in aggregate is processed with some level
of sensorimotor, paralimbic, and limbic involvement, regardless
the empathy level of the listeners or the valence/familiarity of
the music (Zatorre et al., 2007). However, our results seem
to suggest that empathic people tend to be more attuned to
the attribution of human agency and affective intention in
the musical signal, as indicated by preferential engagement
of cognitive empathy networks including PFC (MPF and
DLPFC) and TPJ (Banissy et al., 2012), as well as reward
areas. In other words, what seems to best characterize the
high-empathy response to musical stimuli is the tendency to
take an extra cognitive step towards identification with some
agentive quality of the music, over and above the work of
emotional contagion mechanisms alone. Thus while patterns of
neural resonance consistent with emotional contagion appear to
be common to most experiences of music—and were also found
among high-empathy participants in Experiment 1—activation
of prefrontal cognitive empathy systems for the PT and EC
scales may indicate the tendency of empathic listeners to try
to ‘‘get into the heads’’ of composers, performers, and/or the
virtual persona of the music (Levinson, 2006). This top-down
process is effortful, imaginative, and self-aware, in contrast
to the automatic and pre-reflective mechanisms undergirding
emotional contagion. Accordingly, as suggested by Schubert
(2017), the involvement of cognitive systems may not strictly
speaking be required for affective musical response, which can
largely be accounted for by emotional contagion circuitry alone.
A number of studies have shown that mental imagery may be
supported by sensorimotor and affective components without
the contribution of prefrontal areas (Decety and Grèzes, 2006;
Ogino et al., 2007). Nevertheless, they could betoken a more
social cognitive mode of listening, a deliberative attempt on the
part of listeners to project themselves into the lived experience of
the musical agent. This imaginative projection is more intense,
understandably, for music that empathic people already know,
and also appears to interact with musical preference.
General Implications
The present study has a number of implications for social
and affective neuroscience, music psychology, and musicology.
For neuroscientific empathy research, we demonstrate the
involvement of the core empathy network and mirror neuron
system outside of tasks that are explicitly social cognitive. Most
studies use transparently social experimental tasks and stimuli to
assess neural correlates of state and trait empathy; for example,
viewing pictures or videos of other people (for review, see Singer
and Lamm, 2009). This study demonstrates that musical sound,
which is perhaps not an obvious social stimulus, can elicit
neural responses consistent with theories of empathy. By doing
so, this study highlights the potential value of operationalizing
artistic and aesthetic experience as a window into social cognitive
and affective processing, a perspective that is arguably the
historical progenitor of contemporary empathy research (Lipps,
1907).
For music psychology, this research has at least three main
implications. First, this study demonstrates that trait empathy
may modulate the neurophysiology of music listening. Although
there is mounting behavioral and psychophysiological evidence
pointing to this conclusion (Miu and Vuoskoski, 2017), this
is the first study to investigate the effects of empathy on
the musical brain. Second, this study confirms and extends
empirical claims that music cognition is inextricably linked
to social cognition (Huron, 2001; North and Hargreaves,
2008). Following Schubert’s (2017) common coding model,
our results suggest that aspects of affective music processing
Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org

 Wallmark et al.
Trait Empathy in Music Listening
can be viewed as a specialized subprocess of general social-
affective perception and cognition. This may begin to explain
the neural bases for how music can function as a ‘‘virtual
social agent’’ (Leman, 2007). Third, in demonstrating neural
differences in music processing as a function of empathy,
we highlight the possible significance of looking at other
trait features when assessing the functional neural correlates
of musical tasks and stimuli. Many neurophysiological music
studies take only a few trait features into account in sampling
procedures and analysis, most notably sex, age, and musical
training: the latter has been well explored (e.g., Alluri et al.,
2017), but other factors—such as personality factors and
mood—are not frequently addressed. Individual differences in
music processing may relate to dispositional characteristics
that can be captured by psychosocial questionnaires, indirect
observational techniques, or other methods. Exploring the role
of such trait variables in musical behaviors and brain processing
could provide a more detailed and granular account of music
cognition.
Finally, these results enrich the humanistic study of music
in providing a plausible psychobiological account for the social
valence of musical experience observed in diverse cultural and
historical settings. As music theorist Clifton (1983) claims, ‘‘the
‘other’ need not be a person: it can be music.’’ In a very rough
sense, this study provides empirical support for this statement:
areas implicated in trait empathy and social cognition also appear
to be involved in music processing, and to a significantly greater
degree for individuals with high trait empathy. If music can
function something like a virtual ‘‘other,’’ then it might be
capable of altering listeners’ views of real others, thus enabling
it to play an ethically complex mediating role in the social
discourse of music (Rahaim, 2017). Indeed, musicologists have
historically documented moments of tense cultural encounter
wherein music played an instrumental role in helping one group
to realize the other’s shared humanity (Cruz, 1999). Recent
research would seem to provide behavioral ballast for this view:
using an implicit association task, Vuoskoski et al. (2016) showed
that listening to the music of another culture could positively
modulate attitudes towards members of that culture among
empathic listeners. Though we do not in this study explicitly
address whether music can alter empathic brain circuits, it is
suggestive that certain attitudes toward musical sound may have
behavioral and neural bases in individual differences in trait
empathy.
Limitations
A few important limitations must be considered in interpreting
these results. First, this study was correlational: no causative
links can thus be determined in the relationship between
music and trait empathy. In the future, it would be interesting
to use an empathy priming paradigm (Miu and Baltes
,,
2012) in an fMRI context to compare neurophysiological
correlates of trait empathy with primed ‘‘state’’ empathy
in music listening; this could provide a powerful method
for disentangling possible differences in processing between
dispositional attributes of empathy and contextual factors (e.g.,
socially conditioned attitudes about a performer, mood when
listening). As a corollary to the above, moreover, this study
does not address whether our results are specific to music
listening: perhaps high-empathy people utilize more of these
areas when performing other non-musical yet not explicitly
social tasks as well (e.g., viewing abstract art). Additionally,
we do not explore whether there could be other mediating
trait factors in music processing besides empathy and sex:
personality and temperament, for instance, have been shown
to modulate responses to music (Rentfrow and Gosling, 2003).
Finally, this study will need to be replicated with a larger sample
size, and with participants who do not self-select based on
strong emotional reactions to music, in order to strengthen the
statistical power and generalizability of the results (Yarkoni,
2009).
CONCLUSION
In two experiments using fMRI, this article demonstrates
that trait empathy modulates music processing. Replicating
previous findings in the social neuroscience literature, isolated
musical timbres are related to sensorimotor and paralimbic
activation; in actual music listening, however, empathy is
primarily associated with activity in prefrontal and reward
areas. Empathic participants were found to be particularly
sensitive to abrasive, ‘‘noisy’’ qualities of musical timbre, showing
preferential activation of the SMA, possibly reflecting heightened
motor-mimetic susceptibility to sounds signaling high-arousal,
low-valence affective states. In the music listening task, empathic
subjects demonstrated enhanced responsiveness to familiar
music, with musical preference playing a mediating role. Taken
together, these results confirm and extend recent research on the
link between music and empathy, and may help bring us closer
to understanding the social cognitive basis for music perception
and cognition.
