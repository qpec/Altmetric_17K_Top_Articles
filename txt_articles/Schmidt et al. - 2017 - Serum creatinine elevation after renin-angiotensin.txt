ABSTRACT
ObjeCtive
To examine long term cardiorenal outcomes associated 
with increased concentrations of creatinine after the 
start of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor/
angiotensin receptor blocker treatment.
Design
Population based cohort study using electronic health 
records from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink 
and Hospital Episode Statistics.
setting
UK primary care, 1997-2014.
PartiCiPants
Patients starting treatment with angiotensin 
converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor 
blockers (n=122 363).
Main OutCOMe Measures
Poisson regression was used to compare rates of end 
stage renal disease, myocardial infarction, heart 
failure, and death among patients with creatinine 
increases of 30% or more after starting treatment 
against those without such increases, and for each 
10% increase in creatinine. Analyses were adjusted for 
age, sex, calendar period, socioeconomic status, 
lifestyle factors, chronic kidney disease, diabetes, 
cardiovascular comorbidities, and use of other 
antihypertensive drugs and non-steroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs.
results
Among the 2078 (1.7%) patients with creatinine 
increases of 30% or more, a higher proportion were 
female, were elderly, had cardiorenal comorbidity, and 
used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, loop 
diuretics, or potassium sparing diuretics. Creatinine 
increases of 30% or more were associated with an 
increased adjusted incidence rate ratio for all 
outcomes, compared with increases of less than 30%: 
3.43 (95% confidence interval 2.40 to 4.91) for end 
stage renal disease, 1.46 (1.16 to 1.84) for myocardial 
infarction, 1.37 (1.14 to 1.65) for heart failure, and 1.84 
(1.65 to 2.05) for death. The detailed categorisation of 
increases in creatinine concentrations (<10%, 10-19%, 
20-29%, 30-39%, and ≥40%) showed a graduated 
relation for all outcomes (all P values for trends 
<0.001). Notably, creatinine increases of less than 
30% were also associated with increased incidence 
rate ratios for all outcomes, including death (1.15 (1.09 
to 1.22) for increases of 10-19% and 1.35 (1.23 to 1.49) 
for increases of 20-29%, using <10% as reference). 
Results were consistent across calendar periods, 
across subgroups of patients, and among continuing 
users.
COnClusiOns
Increases in creatinine after the start of angiotensin 
converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor 
blocker treatment were associated with adverse 
cardiorenal outcomes in a graduated relation, even 
below the guideline recommended threshold of a 30% 
increase for stopping treatment.
Introduction
Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and 
angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) are commonly pre-
scribed drugs for hypertension, heart failure, diabetic 
microalbuminuria, and proteinuric renal disease and 
after myocardial infarction.1  Patients may, however, 
have a sudden decline in kidney function after starting 
to take these drugs, owing to antagonism of angioten-
sin II mediated efferent arteriolar constriction.2  Despite 
unambiguous recommendations to detect sudden renal 
impairment by monitoring serum creatinine before and 
after the start of ACEI/ARB treatment and to discon-
tinue treatment if creatinine concentrations increase by 
30% or more,1  recent data show that only 10% of 
patients receive the recommended monitoring and only 
20% of those with a creatinine increase of 30% or more 
after starting ACEI/ARB treatment discontinue the 
drugs.3
Clinical trial data has indicated that ACEI/ARB 
induced renal impairment is uncommon.4 5  Patients 
seen in routine clinical practice are, however, on aver-
age older and have more comorbidity than those 
 
eligible for trials.6  As a consequence, the absolute risk 
of increases in creatinine of 30% or more in the commu-
nity setting is not negligible.3  Although this level of cre-
atinine increase after starting ACEI/ARB treatment 
WhAT IS AlReAdy knoWn on ThIS TopIC
A sudden decline in kidney function may occur after treatment with angiotensin 
converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) is started
Increases in creatinine of up to 30% over baseline levels are generally considered 
safe and even a marker of long term preservation of kidney function
Long term cardiac and renal outcomes associated with more detailed categorisations 
of post-initiation increases in creatinine concentrations are unknown
WhAT ThIS STudy AddS
This cohort study shows a graduated increased risk of end stage renal disease, 
adverse cardiac outcomes, and death for each 10% increase in creatinine, even 
below the 30% threshold
Whether these creatinine changes are causally related to adverse outcomes or 
represent a biomarker of increased risk is unclear
Increases in creatinine after starting ACEI/ARB treatment identify a high risk group 
needing close monitoring and in whom the risks and benefits of ACEI/ARB 
prescribing should be considered

raises concern about the long term balance of risks and 
benefits, smaller increases (<30%) do not prompt con-
sideration of treatment discontinuation according to 
current guidelines. The rationale for the 30% threshold 
in the context of adverse clinical outcomes is unclear,4 
as little evidence is available on the actual risks associ-
ated with creatinine increases of less than 30%.
Considering the high prevalence of ACEI/ARB use in 
general practice, any additional previously unrec-
ognised risks would have major clinical and public 
health implications. We therefore used real world data 
to examine the cardiorenal risks associated with differ-
ent levels of increase in creatinine after the start of 
ACEI/ARB treatment.
Methods
Data sources
We used the UK’s Clinical Practice Research Datalink 
(CPRD), linked to hospital record data from the Hospital 
Episode Statistics (HES) database. The CPRD database 
contains data from primary care electronic health 
records for 7% of the UK population (approximately 15 
million patient lives, with about 8 million currently fol-
lowed).7  Patients included in the CPRD are largely rep-
resentative of the UK population in terms of age, sex, 
and ethnicity.7 
8  Information recorded in the database 
covers demographics such as sex and year of birth, the 
location of the general practice, medical diagnoses 
(based on Read codes), drug prescriptions, and a range 
of routine laboratory test results. The HES records all 
hospital admissions for patients covered by the 
National Health Service who receive treatment from 
either English NHS trusts or independent providers.7 8 
 
Fifty eight per cent of general practices included in the 
CPRD have agreed to HES linkage.7 We used lists of 
Read codes (CPRD) and ICD-10 (international classifica-
tion of diseases, 10th revision) codes (HES) to identify 
outcomes and covariables. We obtained linked data on 
socioeconomic status based on area of residence from 
the UK Index of Multiple Deprivation.
study population
We identified a cohort of all HES linked CPRD patients 
aged 18 years or above who started ACEI/ARB treatment 
between 1 April 1997 and 31 March 2014. We defined new 
users as those with at least one year of continuous regis-
tration in the CPRD before their first recorded prescrip-
tion for ACEI/ARB. We restricted our main study cohort 
to patients with both pre-initiation (within 12 months) 
and post-initiation (within two months) creatinine mea-
surements and excluded patients with end stage renal 
disease diagnosed before cohort entry (n=17).
serum creatinine
We extracted all creatinine test results from the general 
practice records of the study population. We calculated 
a change in creatinine concentrations after the start of 
ACEI/ARB treatment as the relative difference between 
the most recent baseline measurement before or on the 
date of starting treatment and the first follow-up 
 
measurement within two months after starting. We 
defined the baseline measurement as within 12 months 
because previous work suggested that very recent creat-
inine concentrations are obtained for only a small pro-
portion of patients starting ACEI/ARBs.3  We chose the 
two month post-initiation period to accord with the 
interval recommended in reviews of previous trial data.4
In our analysis, we firstly dichotomised the relative 
increase according to the guideline recommended cut-off 
levels of 30% or more versus less than 30%. Secondly, to 
examine whether a graduated (“dose-response”) relation 
existed, we categorised increases in creatinine in more 
detail, as less than 10% (reference group), 10-19%, 
20-29%, 30-39%, and 40% or more. Thirdly, we used frac-
tional polynomials to assess the form of the association 
between the continuous creatinine increase variable and 
outcomes. Because of evidence of non-linearity in the log 
scale for the association with several of the outcomes, we 
kept to the categorical modelling.
Outcomes
We used HES and the CPRD to identify first time diagno-
ses of end stage renal disease, myocardial infarction, 
and heart failure, as well as all cause mortality. We 
defined end stage renal disease as the presence of a hos-
pital or primary care morbidity code for end stage renal 
disease, renal transplant, peritoneal dialysis or haemo-
dialysis, or an arteriovenous fistula (suggesting antici-
pation of end stage renal disease).
Patients’ characteristics
We obtained information for all patients on age, sex, 
socioeconomic status (fifths of 2004 Index of Multiple 
Deprivation scores), lifestyle factors (smoking, alcohol 
intake, and body mass index), comorbidities (diabetes, 
myocardial infarction, heart failure, hypertension, 
arrhythmia, peripheral arterial disease, and chronic 
kidney disease stage), blood pressure measurements 
before and after starting ACEI/ARB treatment, and con-
comitant use of other antihypertensive drugs (β block-
ers, calcium channel blockers, thiazides, loop diuretics, 
and potassium sparing diuretics) and non-steroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs at time of starting ACEI/ARB 
treatment.9  We used algorithms to estimate smoking 
status, alcohol intake, and body mass index based on 
the most recent CPRD records before the start of ACEI/
ARB treatment.10 
11  We calculated estimated glomerular 
filtration rate on the basis of the baseline creatinine 
concentration and the chronic kidney disease stage by 
using the CKD-EPI equation.12
We identified other comorbidities from the CPRD and 
HES on the basis of diagnoses recorded before the start 
of ACEI/ARB treatment. We defined pre-initiation and 
post-initiation systolic and diastolic blood pressure on 
the basis of the most recent measurement within 12 
months before and after the start of ACEI/ARB 
 
treatment. Use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory 
drugs was based on prescriptions recorded within 30 
days before the start of ACE/ARB treatment. We defined 
concurrent use of other antihypertensive drugs by 
courses of continuous treatment for each class of drugs 
concomitant with the ACEI/ARB prescription date. In

identifying continuous courses of treatment, we calcu-
lated the end date of each prescription by adding the 
duration of the prescription (total number of tablets 
prescribed divided by the specified number of tablets 
per day) to the date of the prescription. We further 
allowed for a 30 day gap between the end date of one 
prescription and the start of the next consecutive pre-
scription to allow for alternative sources of drug (eg, 
outpatient clinics) or stockpiling of prescriptions.
Patient involvement
No patients were involved in setting the research ques-
tion or the outcome measures, nor were they involved in 
developing plans for recruitment, design, or implemen-
tation of the study. No patients were asked to advise on 
interpretation or writing up of results. There are no 
plans to disseminate the results of the research to study 
participants or the relevant patient community.
statistical analysis
We characterised all patients starting ACEI/ARB treat-
ment according to sex, age, comorbidities, co-medica-
tion use, socioeconomic status, lifestyle factors, and 
calendar period. We followed all new ACEI/ARB users 
with a change in creatinine concentration between base-
line and the date of the first follow-up test, until the 
occurrence of an outcome, death, withdrawal from the 
general practice, or end of the follow-up period (31 
March 2014), whichever occurred first. We illustrated the 
survival function by using the Kaplan-Meier estimator.
We used Poisson regression to examine the associa-
tion between the percentage increase in creatinine con-
centration and long term cardiorenal risks. We modelled 
the cause specific hazard to account for competing risks 
(that is, censoring outcomes competing with the out-
come of interest), which is appropriate for estimating 
causal effects.13 
14 We calculated rates and incidence rate 
ratios comparing the associations of categories of per-
centage creatinine increase with outcomes, using robust 
standard errors to account for clustering by general 
practice. We adjusted for age and sex in the “crude” 
model. In the main analysis, we also adjusted for the 
comorbidities listed above (including chronic kidney 
disease stage at baseline), use of concurrent drugs, life-
style factors, socioeconomic status, calendar period, 
and time since first prescription. We included age (<50, 
50-59, 60-69, 70-79, and ≥80 years), calendar period 
(1997-2003, 2004-08, and 2009-14) and years since first 
prescription (<1, 1 to <2, 2 to <5, 5 to <10, and ≥10 years) 
as time updated variables. To restrict assessment of out-
comes to patients with incident disease, in each analysis 
we excluded people with a previous history (assessed at 
baseline) of the outcome in question. To examine 
whether patients’ characteristics modified the incidence 
rate ratios, we stratified the analyses by comorbidities. 
We also illustrated the time dependent effect estimates 
for each outcome graphically and did tests for linear 
trends to examine whether an interaction with time 
since starting drug treatment existed.
To consider the effect of potential confounders, we 
examined whether the effect estimates differed from 
our main results in several sensitivity analyses. Firstly, 
we restricted the study period to the most recent 10 
year calendar period (2004-14) to increase the com-
pleteness of covariable recording and to take into 
account temporal differences in patient care.15 Sec-
ondly, we excluded patients with diabetes or chronic 
kidney disease stage 4 to account for measurements 
made at outpatient hospital clinics and therefore not 
available in the CPRD for these groups of patients. 
Thirdly, to explore the effect of drug cessation, we 
restricted the analysis to continuing users (irrespective 
of creatinine result)—that is, patients whose first con-
tinuous course of ACE/ARB treatment ended at least 90 
days after the retest date. Fourthly, to consider the 
potential confounding effect of proteinuria, we 
restricted an analysis to ACEI/ARB users with diabetes, 
among whom we would anticipate that most have sub-
stantial protein excretion. Fifthly, we excluded patients 
with a potassium concentration above 6 mmol/L at the 
first follow-up monitoring to explore the prognostic 
influence of hyperkalaemia on the outcomes, particu-
larly death. Sixthly, to gain insight into potential alter-
native mechanisms leading to increases in creatinine 
after the start of ACEI/ARB treatment, we added a post 
hoc analysis to estimate the relative reduction in 
median systolic and diastolic blood pressure after the 
start of treatment. Finally, we examined whether our 
cohort differed from other patients starting ACEI/ARB 
treatment who did not have both pre-initiation and 
post-initiation creatinine monitoring. For this purpose, 
we resampled all patients starting ACEI/ARB treatment 
in the study period to compare baseline characteristics 
and cumulative mortality risk among those with com-
plete versus incomplete pre-initiation and post-initia-
tion monitoring. We used the STATA 14 statistical 
software package for all analyses.
Results
Patients’ characteristics
Among 303 451 patients who started ACEI/ARB treat-
ment during 1997-2014, 122 363 (40%) had both baseline 
and follow-up creatinine monitoring and were included 
in the study (table 1). Among these, 2078 (1.7%) had an 
increase in creatinine of 30% or more (median age 68 
years) and 120 285 (98.3%) had an increase of less than 
30% (median age 63 years). More detailed categorisa-
tion showed that the creatinine increase was less than 
10% for 102 445 (83.7%) patients, 10-19% for 14 301 
(11.7%) patients, 20-29% for 3539 (2.9%) patients, 
30-39% for 1099 (0.9%) patients, and 40% or more for 
979 (0.8%) patients.
Compared with patients with a creatinine increase of 
less than 30%, a higher proportion of those with an 
increase of 30% or more were female (56.1% v 46.1%) or 
had moderate to severe chronic kidney disease (stage 3b 
or 4) (8.9% v 4.3%), previous myocardial infarction 
(10.5% v 4.5%), heart failure (19.0% v 4.8%), arrhythmia 
(17
.2% v 6.8%), or peripheral arterial disease (6.0% v 
2.5%). Patients with an increase of 30% or more were 
four times more likely to use loop diuretics (28.6% v 7
.2%) 
or potassium sparing diuretics (8.8% v 2.0%) but also

more often used β blockers (23.7% v 17
.0%) and non-ste-
roidal anti-inflammatory drugs (34.0% v 23.5%); fewer 
had hypertension (64.1% v 75.7%), calcium channel 
blocker use (16.9% v 18.9%), current alcohol consump-
tion (71.6% v 78.3%), or obesity (29.0% v 33.4%). The 
overall blood pressure response was similar in the two 
groups after the start of ACEI/ARB treatment, both hav-
ing a 7% reduction in systolic blood pressure (from 150 to 
140 mm Hg in patients with a creatinine increase of 30% 
or more and from 155 to 144 mm Hg in those with a less 
than 30% increase). Socioeconomic status, use of thia-
zides, prevalence of smoking, and prevalence of diabetes 
did not differ between the groups.
levels of creatinine increase and clinical outcomes
Increases in creatinine of 30% or more were associated 
with increased rates of all outcomes (table 2). The 
adjusted incidence rate ratios were 3.43 (95% confi-
dence interval 2.40 to 4.91) for end stage renal disease, 
1.46 (1.16 to 1.84) for myocardial infarction, 1.37 (1.14 to 
1.65) for heart failure, and 1.84 (1.65 to 2.05) for death.
When we examined interactions with time since the 
start of drug treatment (fig 1 and supplementary table 
A), we observed a pronounced effect of time for end 
stage renal disease, with increases in incidence rate 
ratios falling from 12.2-fold during the first year to 3.7-
fold within the second year, to 1.7-fold within 2 to <5 
years, and to 2.5-fold within 5 to <10 years after the start 
of treatment. However, confidence intervals were wide, 
reflecting the relatively small number of end stage renal 
disease events (P for trend=0.094). We observed similar 
trends of decreasing risk over time for heart failure (P 
for trend=0.025) and mortality (P for trend<0.001), 
although effect sizes were smaller. The incidence rate 
ratio for heart failure fell from a 1.9-fold increase within 
the first year to a 1.5-fold increase within the second 
year and remained neutral in risk thereafter. The mor-
tality rate ratio declined from a 3.5-fold increase within 
the first year and remained approximately 50% 
increased thereafter.
The more detailed categorisation of creatinine 
increases showed graduated effects for all outcomes. 
This is illustrated by the survival function in figure 2 . 
The absolute one year risk of dying was 2% in the group 
with less than 10% increase, 2% for 10-19%, 4% for 
20-29%, 7% for 30-39%, and 16% for 40% or above; the 
corresponding risks were 9%, 12%, 16%, 24%, and 37% 
at five years and 22%, 26%, 33%, 42%, and 57% at 10 
years. This “dose-response” relation also held for all 
outcomes after adjustment for possible confounders (fig 
3). Using creatinine increase less than 10% as reference, 
incidence rate ratios increased steadily among patients 
with creatinine increases of 10-19% up to those with 
 
creatinine increases of 40% or more for end stage renal 
disease (1.73 to 4.04; P for trend<0.001), for myocardial 
infarction (1.12 to 1.59; P<0.001), for heart failure (1.14 to 
1.42; P<0.001), and for death (1.15 to 2.11; P<0.001).

creatinine increases of 30% or more was higher in men 
than in women. The precision of estimates for non-fatal 
outcomes varied by subgroups, but without substantial 
modification of the incidence rate ratios. Importantly, 
the incidence rate ratio for death had high precision for 
all subgroups and was consistently increased in 
patients with and without individual comorbidities, 
including diabetes.

B). However, those with complete monitoring had a 
higher prevalence of non-cardiac comorbidity, in par-
ticular diabetes and chronic kidney disease. The cumu-
lative mortality function for this group was similar to 
that of the group with creatinine increases between 
10% and 19% (supplementary figure A). The remaining 
sensitivity analyses all supported the robustness of the 
main results (supplementary tables C and D).
discussion
We found that patients in routine clinical care who 
started treatment with ACEI/ARB and whose creatinine 
concentration had increased by 30% or more at their 
first follow-up monitoring visit were at increased risk 
for adverse cardiac outcomes and death, compared 
with patients with more stable creatinine values. Our 
study thus confirms data from clinical trials in a real 
world clinical setting. Moreover, we established that 
risks were also substantially increased for end stage 
renal disease. In general, risks were highest in the first 
year after the start of ACEI/ARB treatment but were sus-
tained up to 10 years later for end stage renal disease, 
myocardial infarction, and death. Importantly, we 
showed a “dose-response” relation between the level of 
increase in creatinine values and risk of adverse out-
comes, indicating that all increases below 30% cannot 
be viewed as safe. Our results were consistent across 
calendar periods and patient subgroups in a range of 
sensitivity analyses. It is not clear whether increases in 
creatinine values after the start of ACEI/ARB treatment 
are due to pathophysiological processes representing a 
biomarker of increased risk or whether a direct causal 
relation exists between reduced renal function and 
adverse outcomes. These results therefore identify a 
group of patients at high risk but do not necessarily 
support discontinuation of ACEI/ARBs.

the start of ACEI/ARB treatment. It represents an 
important complement to clinical trials, the partici-
pants of which may not be representative of treated 
patients in clinical practice.6 The study’s size and long 
follow-up also permitted examination of a full range of 
outcomes, beyond those evaluated in individual clini-
cal trials. Importantly, this is the first study to examine 
the association with end stage renal disease, as clinical 
trials are rarely powered to examine this outcome.
Patients who had a greater fall in renal function after 
starting ACEI/ARB treatment had a higher proportion of 
comorbidities and concurrent drugs that are themselves 
associated with adverse renal outcomes. However, our 
findings were robust after adjustment for a range of 
potential confounders, including comorbidity, co-med-
ication use, lifestyle factors, and socioeconomic status. 
Nevertheless, residual confounding cannot be 
excluded. We were unable to adjust for proteinuria, a 
potentially important confounder owing to its associa-
tion with adverse cardiorenal outcomes, because of its 
incomplete recording. However, to provide an explana-
tion for our results, proteinuria would need to be asso-
ciated with the degree of increase in creatinine 
concentrations after the start of ACEI/ARB treatment. 
We are not aware of any evidence that this is the case. In 
addition, effect estimates were similar in all analyses 
restricted to patients with diabetes, among whom we 
would anticipate that a high proportion would have 
substantial urinary protein excretion.
The validity of the diagnosis of myocardial infarction 
has consistently been found to be high, with positive pre-
dictive values of 92-93% in both the CPRD and HES.16 
17 
 
Heart failure, end stage renal disease, and mortality have 
not been validated individually. However, the diagnoses 
recorded in the CPRD, particularly in the domains 
assessed by the Quality and Outcomes Framework,18 
19 
 
are in general considered to have adequate validity for 
research purposes, with an overall median proportion of 
cases with a confirmed diagnosis of 89%.20 
21
A limitation of our study was that we could include 
only patients with both baseline and follow-up creati-
nine measurements (complete case analysis) to calcu-
late changes in renal function. Comparison of the 
baseline characteristics of patients with and without 
complete monitoring of creatinine concentrations 
showed no major differences in demographics, socio-
economics, or lifestyle, although a greater proportion of 
those with complete monitoring had diabetes and 
chronic kidney disease. Therefore, the proportion of 
patients with a decline in renal function among those 
starting ACEI/ARB treatment in the population as a 
whole may be lower than that observed in the moni-
tored group. This view was also supported by the cumu-
lative mortality function in the group with incomplete 
monitoring, which was similar to the monitored group 
with less pronounced increases in creatinine. Impor-
tantly, we have no reason to suspect that the associa-
tion between change in renal function and long term 
outcomes is not generalisable to the whole population. 
Also, our results were consistent within strata of 
patients’ comorbidities and when we excluded 
 
subgroups of patients expected to have monitoring per-
formed in outpatient hospital clinics.
Although we used the most recent blood test within 
12 months, two thirds of all baseline creatinine tests 
were carried out within six months of the start of ACE/
ARB treatment. Our study was also able to focus on par-
ticipants whom we were confident continued to be pre-
scribed ACEI/ARBs after their post-initiation blood test 
(regardless of creatinine results). We previously found 
that 80% of patients with creatinine increases of 30% or 
more continued treatment despite guideline recom-
mendations to stop.3 Our new results emphasise the 
clinical implications of these findings, as the adverse 
outcomes associated with creatinine increases also 
applies to continuing ACEI/ARB users.
General practice system software used for issuing 
prescriptions ensures the accuracy of prescription data, 
but we cannot be certain that patients were taking their 
drugs as prescribed. However, given the consistency of 
results for the overall cohort and for patients with pre-
scription coverage 90 days after the monitoring date, 
misclassified drug use is unlikely to have affected the 
results substantially.
Comparison with other studies
Many post hoc analyses of clinical trials have examined 
the prognostic significance of a deterioration in renal 
function after the start of ACEI/ARB treatment. In clini-
cal trials of patients with heart failure, deterioration in 
renal function after starting ACEI/ARB treatment is 
commonly found.22  Although this deterioration is asso-
ciated with a poorer prognosis compared with patients 
with preserved renal function, the overall benefits of 
ACEI/ARB treatment compared with placebo remain for 
cardiovascular outcomes and mortality.22 Our study 
does not undermine that evidence but flags that the 
risk-benefit ratio may differ among patients with 
marked changes in creatinine concentrations. This is 
particularly the case for other prescribing indications 
for which the clinical trial evidence is less clear.
The recommendation in many international guide-
lines to stop ACEI/ARB treatment if creatinine rises by 
30% or more after initiation are founded on a single 
review of 12 clinical trials of ACEI/ARB treatment for 
diabetes and heart failure.4  Studies included in this 
review evaluated progression of renal disease among 
patients with pre-existing renal impairment. Of these 
studies, only six were double blinded and included a 
total of 1102 participants. These trials were published 
during 1993-97 and may not relate to patients receiving 
contemporary routine clinical care. The methods that 
define a cut-off level of creatinine increase at 30% for 
cessation are not clearly presented.4  In addition, the 
results provided by these studies are not supported by 
later trials. Recent reviews have not shown the superi-
ority of ACEI/ARBs compared with other antihyperten-
sive drugs for treating early non-diabetic chronic kidney 
disease,23  diabetes with normal renal function,24  and 
diabetes and chronic kidney disease.25  A UK multi-
centre interventional trial to compare the outcomes of 
continuation versus cessation of ACEI/ARB treatment is

under way in response to observational evidence that 
stopping ACEI/ARB treatment may slow progression in 
advanced renal disease.26 
27
A fixed recommendation to stop ACEI/ARB treatment 
only if creatinine is increased by 30% or more is also 
hard to reconcile with the growing body of evidence 
related to acute kidney injury, which shows that even a 
small deterioration in renal function is associated with 
a subsequently increased risk of mortality and other 
adverse outcomes.28  It is important to consider that the 
prognostic significance of ACEI/ARB associated renal 
impairment may depend on the underlying cause and 
on subsequent changes in renal function if ACEI/ARB 
treatment is continued.4 22 Underlying causes may be 
different in the routine care setting, in which patients 
are older, have multiple comorbidities, and have more 
advanced kidney disease compared with patients who 
participated in early clinical trials.
Conclusions and implications
In routine primary care, most patients starting treat-
ment with an ACEI/ARB have only minor changes in 
renal function. However, increases in creatinine con-
centrations of more than 10% after starting ACEI/ARB 
treatment affect more than 15% of patients and have 
important implications. We have shown that creatinine 
increases after the start of ACEI/ARB treatment were 
associated with cardiorenal risks in a “dose-response” 
relation, with no distinct cut-off at 30%, as previously 
suggested. Further investigation is needed to ascertain 
whether ACEI/ARB associated changes in renal function 
unmask underlying pathophysiology or lead directly to 
adverse outcomes by causing permanent renal impair-
ment in some patients. In addition, a better under-
standing of the overall risk-benefit ratio of continuing 
treatment after loss of kidney function for different pre-
scribing indications is needed. Most importantly, 
patients with substantial increases in creatinine after 
starting ACEI/ARB treatment should be recognised as a 
very high risk group needing close ongoing monitoring. 
Review is needed of the risks and potential benefits of 
continuation of drug treatment for the specific prescrib-
ing indication for each patient.
