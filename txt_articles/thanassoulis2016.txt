Abstract 
Background—Current guidelines recommend statins in primary prevention of cardiovascular 
disease based on predicted cardiovascular risk without directly considering the expected benefits 
of statin therapy based on the available randomized trial (RCT) evidence.  
Methods and Results—We included 2,134 participants representing 71.8 million American 
residents potentially eligible for statins in primary prevention from the National Health and 
Nutrition Examination Survey for years 2005–2010.  We compared statin eligibilities using two 
separate approaches: a 10-year risk-based approach (�7.5% 10-year risk) and an individualized 
benefit approach (i.e. based on predicted absolute risk reduction over 10 years [ARR10] �2.3% 
from RCT data). A risk-based approach led to the eligibility of 15.0 million (95% confidence 
interval 12.7-17.3 millions) Americans, whereas a benefit-based approach identified 24.6 (21.0-
28.1) million.  The corresponding numbers needed to treat over 10 years were 21 (range:9–44) 
and 25 (9-44).  The benefit-based approach identified 9.5 million lower-risk (<7.5% 10-year risk) 
Americans not currently eligible for statin treatment, who had the same or greater expected 
benefit from statins (�2.3% ARR10) as higher-risk individuals. This lower-risk/acceptable-benefit 
group includes younger individuals (mean age 55.2 years vs. 62.5 years; p<0.001 for benefit-
based vs risk-based) with higher LDL-C (140 mg/dL vs.133 mg/dL; p=0.01).  Statin treatment 
among this group would be expected to prevent an additional 266,508 cardiovascular events over 
10 years.  
Conclusions—An individualized statin benefit approach can identify lower-risk individuals who 
have equal or greater expected benefit from statins in primary prevention than higher-risk 
individuals. This may help develop guideline recommendations that better identify individuals 
who meaningfully benefit from statin therapy.

Introduction 
In 2013, the ACC/AHA Cholesterol Guidelines determined that with the exception of those with 
diabetes or LDL-C>190 mg/dl individuals should be selected for statin therapy for primary 
prevention of cardiovascular (CV) disease based on predicted 10-year cardiovascular risk1.  Such 
a risk-based approach leads to greater statin eligibility among older individuals with lower levels 
of LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) while limiting eligibility in younger individuals with higher LDL-C 
because predicted risk is driven primarily by age2. Defining statin eligibility using a predicted 
risk threshold also implicitly assumes that the benefit of statins is constant in all eligible 
individuals, irrespective of the factors that contribute to their increased risk, such as higher age 
as opposed to higher LDL-C.  
Alternate approaches in determining statin eligibility have also been recently proposed, 
including the use of novel markers for better risk classification3, 4 as well as the use of entry 
criteria for randomized trials (RCT) to define statin benefit groups5, 6.  Moreover, Pandya et al.  
have shown that statin preventive therapy remains cost-effective even at lower risk thresholds 
than selected by the ACC/AHA guidelines7. Although each of these approaches has advantages 
and disadvantages, none directly considers the clinical benefits from statin therapy for each 
individual based on the available clinical trial data8.   
The Cholesterol Treatment Trialists (CTT) have demonstrated that the relative benefit of 
statin therapy is greater at lower levels of risk9. Furthermore, since the reduction in 
cardiovascular risk per mmol/L reduction in LDL-C is close to constant, as reported by CTT9, 
then the potential benefit for each individual should depend on their baseline LDL-C, as well as, 
their baseline risk10, 11.  Indeed, taking into account predicted risk and baseline LDL-C, Soran et 
al have recently demonstrated that potential benefit from statin therapy is substantially variable12. 
as opposed to higher LDL-C.

We now report a model based on individualized predicted statin benefit to select individuals for 
statin therapy for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. This model integrates both 
the predicted risk as well as relative risk reductions observed in randomized trials and yields an 
approach consistent with the concept of precision medicine13, 14, in which treatment is targeted to 
those in whom benefit is expected to be greatest.  We compare the performance of this benefit-
based model in the American population to the conventional risk-based approach for determining 
statin eligibility in primary prevention. We also evaluate whether individuals recommended for 
treatment by each approach met inclusion criteria for statin RCTs in primary prevention.   
 
Methods 
Study Sample 
We utilized NHANES data collected between 2005 and 2010 for the present analysis.  The 
NHANES is a national representative survey of the civilian non-institutionalized US population 
and has been described previously2.  All individuals provided informed consent as part of the 
NHANES study; local IRB approval was not required for this analysis.  The sample included 
3,773 participants between the ages of 40-75 for whom fasting plasma lipid values were 
available.  To create a sample of potentially eligible individuals for statins in primary prevention, 
we excluded 488 participants with prior cardiovascular disease, 114 with LDL-C � 190 mg/dl 
and 568 with diabetes, since statins are indicated in these groups regardless of predicted risk. We 
also excluded 401 individuals currently receiving lipid-lowering therapy as we could not 
determine their baseline LDL-C prior to treatment.  We also excluded 68 participants who had 
missing data with respect to LDL-C or other risk factors needed to calculate risk using the pooled 
cohorts equation15 (PCE) resulting in a study sample of 2,134 participants representing 71.8

cholesterol)�(high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-C])�(triglycerides/5) in mg/dL]16   
Risk-based and individualized statin benefit approaches 
Two approaches for selecting individuals for statins in primary prevention were compared: a 
risk-based approach and an individualized benefit-based approach. For the risk-based approach 
for statin eligibility, we used the 2013 ACC/AHA guidelines, which recommend that individuals 
with a 10-year PCE risk �7.5% and LDL-C �70 mg/dL are eligible for statin in primary 
prevention.  
For the individualized benefit-based approach, we first calculated the 10-year predicted 
risk for each individual using the race- and sex-specific pooled cohorts equation. Individualized 
relative risk reduction estimates from statins for each individual were obtained from CTT 
estimates based on their level of risk and LDL-C.9 Predicted absolute risk reductions at 10-years 
for each individual (ARR10)- that is, benefit- was calculated from the individual’s 10-year 
predicted risk and their corresponding CTT relative risk reduction estimates adjusted for CTT’s 
inclusion of revascularizations and converted from 5-year to 10-year risk (see Supplementary 
Material for full details).  All individuals were assumed to receive mid-potency statins and to 
have an expected LDL-C lowering of 40%, based on the statin lowering effect seen in large 
RCTs1. For our primary analysis, we used an individualized 10-yr absolute risk reduction 
threshold of �2.3% (i.e. NNT10 � 44) for statin eligibility, which we determined to be the 
minimum expected statin benefit among current 2013 guideline eligibles.   
We also performed sensitivity analyses where: (1) we examined the impact on statin 
eligibility among the US population using a more liberal statin strategy (ARR10 � 1.5%), as well 
as a more restrictive strategy (ARR10 � 3.0%); and (2) we explored the impact of different statin 
isk for each individual using the race- and sex-specific pooled cohorts equation. In

Evidence from statins RCTs 
To determine whether eligible individuals using either a risk-based or an individualized benefit 
approach met eligibility criteria for statins RCTs, we identified all relevant RCTs in primary 
prevention using the search methods used by the Cochrane collaboration’s systematic review of 
randomized statin trials in primary prevention (which identified 18 randomized trials)17.  We 
identified no new relevant trials since publication of that report.  Full details of our approach to 
identify trial inclusion criteria in NHANES participants can be found in the supplement (Figure 
S1).  In brief, we identified 5 trials that defined the major statin benefit groups:  
AFCAPS/TexCAPS
14, WOSCOPS
15, MEGA
16, ASCOT-LLA
17 and JUPITER
18 and extracted a 
set of inclusion criteria, which could be specifically identified from any available NHANES 
variable. For an individual to be statin trial eligible in our analysis, they were required to meet 
the inclusion criteria of at least 1 of the 5 statin trials.   
Statistical Analysis 
Descriptive statistics were reported as means (± standard deviations) or percentages for 
continuous and discrete data, respectively.   Differences in means were compared using 2-sample 
t-tests or chi-square tests for parametric or non-parametric data, respectively.  Since individual 
10-year risk from the pooled cohorts equation is estimated separately among men and women 
and across ethnicities, we provide the overall characteristics for each of these groups.  The 
numbers of American residents meeting specified eligibility criteria and all associated statistics 
were estimated and compared using the NHANES analytical guidelines18 and SAS 9.4 (Cary 
NC) SURVEY procedures. We used EulerAPE 3.0.0 software19 to develop diagrams depicting 
overlaps in numbers (or percentages) of residents meeting various sets of eligibility criteria.  We

provide the group 10-year predicted risk, ARR and NNT as well as, the range of these values for 
each individual within each statin eligibility group.  To determine the performance of each 
approach in identifying acceptable benefit, we calculated the proportion of all individuals with an 
acceptable statin benefit (i.e. ARR10 � 2.3%) identified by a risk-based or based on trial inclusion 
criteria (i.e. akin to “sensitivity”).  We also determined the proportion with acceptable statin 
benefit among the risk-based and trials-based eligibles (i.e. akin to “specificity”).    To determine 
the population impact of using an individualized benefit based approach over a risk-based 
approach, we calculated the number of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events (fatal and 
non-fatal MI and stroke) over 10 years by summing the ARR10 across all individuals with �2.3% 
ARR10 or 7.5% PCE 10-year risk for the individualized benefit approach and the 2013 risk-based 
approach, respectively, maintaining the appropriate NHANES weights for each individual and 
assuming 100% compliance with moderate-intensity statins.  
 
Results 
Estimates of statin eligibility and numbers needed to treat in primary prevention using a 
risk-based  or individualized statin benefit approach 
The clinical characteristics of the 2,134 NHANES participants potentially eligible for statins in 
primary prevention are summarized in Table 1. Applying the predicted CV risk criterion for 
statin eligibility (i.e. �7.5% 10-year risk and LDL � 70 mg/dL) from the 2013 ACC/AHA 
guidelines led to 21% as being statin-eligible (15.0 million Americans; 95% confidence interval 
[CI] 12.7-17.3million), whereas an individualized statin benefit-approach (an ARR10 � 2.3%) 
would declare 34% as statin-eligible (24.6 million; 95% CI 21.0-28.1 million).   
Among 2013 guideline eligibles, the mean 10-yr predicted risk was 13.9% (range: 7.5% - 
43.5%) and the expected ARR10 from statins was 4.8% (range: 2.3% - 10.6%) whereas for the

individualized statin benefit approach, the mean 10-yr predicted risk was 10.9% (range 3.7% - 
43.5%) and the expected ARR10 was 4.0% (range: 2.3%-10.6%).  This corresponds to a group 
NNT10 of 21 (range: 9 – 44) and 25 (range: 9-44) for statin eligibility based on 2013 guidelines 
or individualized benefit-based approaches, respectively.  
In separate analyses, we also considered alternate benefit thresholds at 1.5% and 3%, 
corresponding to a more liberalized versus a more restrictive statin approach (Supplementary 
Figures S2 and S3).   A lower benefit threshold of 1.5% ARR would lead to 35.6 million being 
statin-eligible at a mean 10-year predicted risk of 8.7% and a group NNT10 of 30 (range 9-67) 
whereas a higher benefit threshold of 3%, would include 17.3 million at a mean risk of 12.9% 
and a group NNT10 of 21 (range 9-34).  We note that at lower ARR thresholds, eligibility was 
broadly extended to many lower-risk individuals, whereas at higher ARR thresholds, there was a 
progressive exclusion of current statin eligible higher-risk individuals (i.e. �7.5% 10-year risk) 
who fell below the requisite statin ARR threshold (i.e. higher risk/lower statin benefit 
individuals). For example, at the higher ARR threshold of 3.0%, 3.1 million lower-risk 
individuals would be expected to achieve this degree of absolute benefit, whereas 0.8 million 
higher-risk individuals would not.   
We also conducted sensitivity analyses to assess the impact of varying statin potency 
(Supplementary Figure S4). These analyses found that at higher statin potency (i.e. 50% LDL-
C reductions), the number of statin eligible based on individualized benefit increased further 
(28.3 million would be eligible at ARR10 � 2.3%, assuming all received high potency statins).  
Using individualized expected statin benefit to determine statin eligibility among lower-risk 
individuals not currently recommended for statin treatment by 2013 ACC/AHA guidelines 
Of the 24.6 million individuals with an expected ARR � 2.3%, 15.0 million were at high risk (i.e. 
and a group NNT10 of 21 (range 9-34).  We note that at lower ARR thresholds, eli

� 7.5% predicted 10-yr risk) and therefore guideline eligible as per the 2013 ACC/AHA 
guidelines (Figure 1).  Of this higher-risk/acceptable benefit group, 52.6% (7.9 million 
Americans) would have also qualified for a statin RCT in primary prevention and therefore this 
represents the group in which the use of statins would be most strongly supported by evidence. 
We also identified 9.5 million individuals who were at lower risk (i.e. predicted 10-yr risk < 
7.5%), and therefore not statin-eligible under the 2013 guidelines, but in whom the expected 
ARR10 was �2.3%. This lower-risk/acceptable-benefit group includes 5.7 million individuals 
(60%) who would have qualified for at least 1 statin RCT in primary prevention.   
As compared to the 2013 risk-based eligibility group, the 9.5 million lower-
risk/acceptable benefit subgroup consisted of younger patients (mean age = 55.2 years vs. 62.5 
years; p<0.001 for individual benefit vs 2013 guidelines) with higher LDL-C (140 mg/dL vs. 133 
mg/dL; p=0.013) at lower PCE risk (6% vs 14%; p<0.001).   As shown in Table 2, this lower-
risk acceptable benefit group consisted of 2 major sub-groups: 5.7 million individuals, with RCT 
evidence of benefit, who were younger with higher LDL-C; and 3.8 million individuals, without 
RCT evidence of benefit, who had a similar risk factor profile to current 2013 guideline eligibles, 
with the exception of being significantly younger (and therefore at lower 10-year predicted risk).   
In sensitivity analysis, we considered whether a lower risk threshold of �5% or �3% PCE 
risk would identify additional individuals with acceptable benefit.  Lowering the risk threshold to 
� 5% PCE risk included 7.66 million more individuals with ARR � 2.3% but also failed to 
identify 19% of individuals with acceptable benefit (1.88 million individuals).  In addition, this 
lower risk threshold also included 1.84 million individuals at lower benefit (< 2.3% ARR).  
Further lowering the threshold to �3% PCE, identified 1.88 million additional individuals with 
acceptable benefit but also included 10.42 million individuals at lower benefit.  Finally, we also

show (Supplementary Table S1) that as the risk threshold is lowered, many additional 
individuals are eligible for treatment but at increasing NNT.   
Performance of the 2013 guidelines and/or statin inclusion criteria to identify individuals 
with expected statin benefit �2.3% 
We examined the performance of the risk-based approach (i.e. � 7.5% 10- year risk), the use of 
trial inclusion criteria or the presence of both criteria (i.e. increased risk and trial inclusion as 
recently proposed by Ridker et al5), to identify individuals with an acceptable statin benefit (� 
2.3% ARR10).   The proportion of individuals with an expected 10-year statin benefit of �2.3% 
identified by a risk-based, trial-based or hybrid risk/trial approach (i.e. “sensitivity”), was 61%, 
55.5% and 32%, respectively. Conversely, the corresponding proportion of individuals who 
derived an expected ARR < 2.3% identified as ineligible based on these 3 approaches (i.e. 
“specificity”) were 100%,76.5% and 100%, respectively.   
Ten-year predicted risk and corresponding LDL-C levels to maintain constant individual 
statin benefit 
To illustrate the impact of using individualized statin benefit to determine statin eligibility, we 
plotted the 10-year predicted risk and corresponding LDL-C levels required to maintain a 
constant individual statin benefit at different ARR10 thresholds to create isopleths (i.e. curves of 
equal absolute benefit) (Figure 2).  Individuals who fall on or above an ARR10 isopleth would 
receive at least the selected statin benefit for the corresponding curve.  Figure 2 demonstrates the 
inverse curvilinear relation between LDL-C and 10-year predicted risk to maintain a constant 
statin benefit. To maintain an ARR10 of �2.3%, the 10-year risk threshold for statin eligibility 
varies markedly across the range of LDL-C values: the higher the level of LDL-C, the lower the 
predicted risk needed to demonstrate statin benefit. For example, an individual at 7.5% 10-year 
55.5% and 32%, respectively. Conversely, the corresponding proportion of individ

risk and an LDL-C of 85 mg/dl, derives the same 2.3% ARR10 from statins as an individual with 
a 5% 10-year risk and an LDL-C of 125 mg/dl. At very high LDL-C (180-189 mg/dL), 
individuals with a 10-year risk as low as 3.75% have the same ARR10 = 2.3% (i.e. NNT10 = 44).   
We also display isopleths of statin benefit of 1%, 1.5%, 3% and 4% corresponding to 
NNT10 of 100, 67, 33 and 25 (Figure 2).   We note that at lower ARR thresholds (i.e. 
ARR10<2.3%), many additional lower-risk (<7.5% 10-year risk) individuals meet statin 
eligibility, whereas at higher ARR thresholds, many current statin eligible individuals (i.e. >7.5% 
10-year risk) with lower LDL-C, would no longer be statin eligible.  An ARR10 �2.3% threshold 
maintains all current statin eligible individuals (based on 2013 guidelines) unchanged, but 
extends eligibility to lower risk individuals with higher LDL-C, who have the same (or greater) 
expected statin benefit.   
Estimates of ASCVD events prevented using a risk-based as compared to an individual 
benefit approach 
A risk-based approach (�7.5% 10 year PCE risk) would be expected to prevent 728,572 ASCVD 
events over 10 years whereas an individualized-benefit approach (�2.3% ARR10) is estimated to 
prevent 995,080 ASCVD events over 10 years.   Treatment of the 9.5 million individuals at 
lower-risk/acceptable benefit identified by the individualized-benefit approach would be 
estimated to contribute an additional 266,508 ASCVD events prevented over 10 years, which 
corresponds to an increase in prevented ASCVD events by 36.6% over a risk-based approach.   
 
Discussion 
In this analysis of 2,134 NHANES participants representing 71.8 million Americans without 
prior CV disease, diabetes or LDL-C >189 mg/dL, we demonstrate that an individualized statin

benefit approach using a 2.3% ARR10 threshold would lead to 24.6 million Americans being 
potentially eligible for statin therapy in primary prevention.  This group would have an absolute 
statin benefit over 10 years of 4.0%, giving a group NNT10 of 25 (and an individual NNT10 
range: 9-44).  In contrast, the current ACC/AHA 2013 risk-based approach (�7.5% PCE 10-year 
risk) would include 15.0 million statin eligible individuals at a similar group NNT10 of 21 
(individual NNT10 range 9 – 44). Notably, we also demonstrate that an individualized statin 
benefit-based approach identifies many low-risk individuals, who are not currently deemed statin 
eligible under the 2013 guidelines, but who are likely to derive substantial benefit from statins in 
primary prevention.  Based on the minimum expected statin benefit threshold among 2013 
guideline eligibles (i.e. an expected ARR10 � 2.3%; NNT10 � 44), we identified 9.5 million 
additional Americans at lower 10-year predicted risk who have an expected statin benefit over 10 
years at least as great as higher-risk individuals currently statin-eligible by the 2013 guidelines.   
This lower-risk/acceptable statin benefit group includes younger individuals with moderate 
elevations in LDL-C but whose predicted CV risk does not yet exceed the threshold for statin-
eligibility (i.e. < 7.5% 10-year risk). Approximately 60% of individuals in this group would have 
also qualified for statin RCTs that demonstrated statin benefit, further supporting the 
appropriateness of statin use in this group.  
Our results indicate that initiating statin therapy in these individuals, despite their lower 
risk, would likely result in substantial clinical benefit, even in the short to medium-term (i.e. 10 
years).  Projected over 10 years, treatment of this lower risk/acceptable benefit group would be 
expected to prevent an additional 266,508 cardiovascular events (i.e. fatal and non-fatal MI and 
stroke), primarily in younger individuals, which represents a 36.6% increase in the number of 
ASCVD events prevented over a risk-based approach. Finally, we show that, although both a

risk-based approach or the use of statin trial inclusion criteria have a high “specificity” for 
identifying an individualized statin ARR � 2.3%, both approaches have relatively low 
“sensitivity”, confirming that they both miss large segments of the population who have an 
acceptable clinical benefit from statins. We also demonstrate that although lowering the risk 
threshold captures additional individuals with acceptable benefit, this also markedly increases the 
eligibles at lower benefit, resulting in progressively higher NNTs.  An individualized statin 
benefit approach therefore, provides a framework to efficiently select individuals who will derive 
an acceptable benefit from statins, information, which could also be helpful to guide discussions 
with patients regarding the advantages and disadvantages of statin use, especially in those at 
lower predicted risk.  
A limitation of current guideline approaches for statin eligibility is that they are based 
largely on predicted risk without direct consideration for the expected clinical benefits of statin 
therapy. A purely risk-based approach presumes that statins are equally effective among all 
individuals at any particular predicted risk level, regardless of whether their risk is driven by 
advanced age, LDL-C or other risk factors.  Furthermore, this approach implies that statin benefit 
is so strongly tied to predicted risk that only high-risk individuals derive an acceptable benefit 
from statins.  However, a predicted risk threshold has never been used as an entry criterion for a 
randomized trial and therefore the validity of this approach has not been directly tested.  Indeed, 
statins failed to reduce CV event rates among high-risk dialysis patients in the AURORA trial20, 
and produced lower than expected event reductions among high-risk heart failure patients21, 
indicating that the benefits of statins cannot be automatically extrapolated to all high-risk 
patients (which has led recent guidelines to make no recommendation for statins in these 
groups). By contrast, the CTT collaboration has established that a unit of LDL-C lowering is, in 
ower predicted risk.

fact, more effective in reducing vascular events in lower risk, as compared to higher risk 
individuals, perhaps due to the presence of less advanced arterial disease9.   It is also not 
generally appreciated that the CTT data demonstrate that statin clinical benefit is greatest at 
higher baseline LDL-C levels because for a given dose of statins (which leads to an average 
expected percent LDL reduction), individuals with higher LDL-C have a greater absolute 
reduction in LDL-C and the relative risk reduction from statins relates to the absolute decrease in 
LDL-C11.    
Based on these observations, we demonstrate that the expected statin benefit for an 
individual does not simply track with 10-year risk, but varies markedly based on risk, LDL-C 
levels and statin potency.   As illustrated in Figure 2, we show that an individual with a 7.5% 10-
year risk and an LDL-C of 85 mg/dl, who is currently statin-eligible, derives the same 2.3% 
ARR10 from moderate potency statins as an individual with a 5% 10-year risk and an LDL-C of 
125 mg/dl.  Moreover, at very high LDL-C (i.e. 180-189 mg/dL), statin benefit begins to exceed 
2.3 % ARR10 at a 10-yr risk as low as 3.75%. Yet despite equivalent benefit, such individuals are 
not currently eligible for statins because of their low predicted 10-year risk. Recently, Soran et al 
have reported similar observations with regards to the NNT for statin therapy based on the 
available RCT data22.  However, Soran et al, as have we (in prior work10,11) used fixed risk 
reductions per change in LDL-C as opposed to the individualized estimates we employed in our 
model, which incorporates the variable benefit of statins observed across different risk strata. 
The present study extends these general observations to demonstrate the population-based impact 
of these concepts and highlights the potential utility of determining statin eligibility based on the 
individualized statin benefit rather than only the predicted risk.   
An individualized benefit model that integrates both the predicted risk and the expected 
evels and statin potency.   As illustrated in Figure 2, we show that an individual wit

relative reductions from statins for each individual leads to a preventive strategy that is 
consistent with the emerging concept of precision medicine13, 14.  Such an approach refocuses the 
issue of statin therapy in primary prevention back to LDL, a causal factor for vascular disease 
that is also, as we and others have shown, a potent biomarker of statin benefit10, 11, 22, 23.  Indeed, 
it is becoming increasingly evident that statins reduce CV events primarily, if not exclusively, by 
lowering LDL24.   Although lipoprotein measures are currently included in risk calculators, their 
effects are largely outweighed by the impact of age, such that even marked elevations in LDL 
lead to only marginal changes in risk. An individualized statin benefit approach partially 
overcomes this limitation because higher LDL is a stronger predictor of statin benefit than of 
future CV events, and for the purpose of statin eligibility, expected benefit rather than predicted 
risk is the more relevant outcome.   
The individualized benefit model we describe and our findings with respect to the 
population impact of such an approach could be of interest to future guideline groups as they 
consider alternate approaches to determine statin eligibility.  Individualized statin benefit 
provides an evidence-based approach to extending eligibility to younger, lower-risk individuals 
by identifying even in the short-term the benefits of controlling moderate elevations in LDL and 
fills an important gap in the management of such patients25-27.  This approach is consistent with 
mounting evidence from lifetime risk estimates28, Mendelian randomization29 and recent 
observational studies30, as well as RCT data9, demonstrating that LDL control in early to mid-
adulthood, rather than later in life, may be more effective in preventing CV disease.  Our 
approach differs markedly from other approaches for “personalized” prevention, which focus 
uniquely on improved stratification of predicted risk with little or no attention to the clinical 
benefits of therapy.  Additional studies with other biomarkers including blood-based, genomic 
future CV events, and for the purpose of statin eligibility, expected benefit rather

and imaging markers that demonstrate improvements not only in stratification of predicted risk, 
but also in the relative benefit from statins, are needed to better target statin eligibility to those 
with the most expected benefit31, 32.  An individualized benefit calculator (i.e. web-based and/or 
mobile application), to allow clinicians to utilize and share this information at the point-of-care, 
with their patients, is needed and is currently in development.   
Our study has several strengths including the use of the well-characterized, nationally 
representative NHANES data.  We also used robust statin relative risk reduction estimates from 
the largest meta-analysis of statin randomized trials to calculate statin benefit.  Several 
limitations also deserve mention. First, we used an absolute event reduction threshold of �2.3%, 
which corresponds to the minimum expected benefit observed among statin eligible individuals 
based on the 2013 guidelines and is therefore internally consistent with current recommendations 
for statin treatment.  It is important to note that this benefit threshold (ARR �2.3%), would lead 
to treatment of nearly 60% more individuals in primary prevention and therefore further 
analyses, including cost-effectiveness, will be needed to identify the optimal threshold of 
absolute benefit7, 33.  Nonetheless, as we have shown, our approach can be adapted to any ARR 
threshold deemed clinically meaningful and/or economically attractive.  Second, we focused on 
the primary risk-based criterion of �7.5% PCE risk for statin eligibility based on the 2013 
ACC/AHA guidelines.  We were unable to assess the impact of considering other statin 
eligibility criteria including the use of additional markers among individuals at 5-7.4% risk, 
which may identify additional individuals with acceptable benefit.  Third, we applied the 
inclusion criteria of the included trials to each NHANES participant to define the individuals 
with trial evidence of benefit, as is often done clinically in determining whether the result of a 
trial applies to a given patient.  We acknowledge that an intervention does not necessarily benefit

all included individuals and that all eligible individuals are not always adequately represented in 
randomized trials. Fourth, we recognize that calculations of benefit, just as calculations of risk, 
are reasonably precise for groups but less precise for individuals34. Fifth, we only considered the 
benefit attributable to changes in LDL-C in our calculation of statin benefit, as LDL-C has the 
most evidence to support its use as a biomarker of statin benefit.  However, in future benefit 
calculations, the effects of biomarkers, such as coronary calcification, which improve the 
estimate of risk, or apoB, which improves the estimate of benefit23would also need to be 
considered.  Sixth, we assumed that mid-potency statins would be used in all individuals in 
primary prevention and would yield a 40% reduction in LDL-C1.  As we have shown in our 
sensitivity analyses, higher potency statins with greater LDL-C reductions would lead to greater 
expected statin benefit and would further extend eligibility to lower risk individuals. Finally, we 
only focused on the benefits of statin therapy and did not consider the possible harms.  However, 
based on the low absolute risk of harm from moderate intensity statins as reported in the 2013 
guidelines15, 25 (number needed to harm [NNH10] over 10 years ~100), the risk-benefit of 
moderate-intensity statins is very favorable at the ARR thresholds we used (i.e minimum ARR10 
� 2.3%; maximum NNT10 � 44) with a relatively large margin of safety. Although this implies 
that ~96,000 additional cases of diabetes (mainly among pre-diabetics) and/or rare muscle 
damage would be expected nationwide, it should be noted that the mean NNT10 for this benefit-
based model was 25 for fatal and non-fatal MI/stroke events (excluding “softer” events such as 
revascularization), which indicates that the mean benefit is substantially greater than the mean 
harm over 10 years.  It is also important to note that based on the expected harms of high-
intensity statins (NNH10 ~ 33), the risk-benefit of these agents may be less favorable in primary 
prevention.

In summary, an individualized statin benefit approach can identify lower-risk individuals 
who have equal or greater expected benefit from statins in primary prevention than higher-risk 
individuals. This may help identify patients who meaningfully benefit from statins in future 
guideline recommendations. The concept of individualized statin benefit could also be helpful to 
physicians and patients in discussing the potential merits and limitations of statin preventive 
therapy1.

Clinical Perspective 
Current guidelines recommend statins in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease based on 
predicted cardiovascular risk without directly considering the expected benefits of statin therapy 
based on the available randomized trial (RCT) evidence. The Cholesterol Treatment Trialists 
(CTT) have demonstrated that the relative benefit of statin therapy is greater at lower levels of 
risk. Furthermore, since the reduction in cardiovascular risk per mmol/L reduction in LDL-C is 
close to constant, as reported by CTT, then the potential benefit for each individual should 
depend on their baseline LDL-C, as well as, their baseline risk. We now report a new model 
based on individualized predicted statin benefit to select individuals for statin therapy for the 
primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. This model integrates both the predicted risk as 
well as relative risk reductions observed in randomized trials. We show that an individualized 
statin benefit approach identifies 9.5 million lower-risk Americans individuals who have equal or 
greater expected benefit from statins in primary prevention than higher-risk individuals. 
Treatment of these younger individuals (who frequently have higher levels of LDL-C) could 
potentially prevent an additional 266,000 atherosclerotic events over 10 years, as compared to 
standard approaches. An individualized benefit approach may therefore help identify patients 
who meaningfully benefit from statins in future guideline recommendations. The concept of 
individualized statin benefit could also be helpful to physicians and patients in discussing the 
potential merits and limitations of statin preventive therapy.

 Absolute risk reduction (ARR)/”benefit” formulation 
The expected 10-y absolute risk reduction (ARR10) or “benefit” from reducing LDL-C (L, 
mmol/L) by 40% (where [L*40%] represents the absolute difference in LDL expected from 
moderate intensity statin) thereby reducing a subject’s risk from a baseline untreated PCE 
risk (R0) to a treated risk (Rt) based on an individual hazard ration (HRi) per mmol/L LDL-C 
reduction was calculated using the Cox proportional hazards model assumptions involving 
baseline disease-free survival without (S0) and with treatment (St) as follows: 
 
S0 = 1 - R0 
 
x = HRi
 (L*40%) 
 
St = S0
x  
 
Rt = 1 – St 
 
ARR = R0 - Rt  
R0 was estimated for each individual from race- and sex-specific pooled cohorts 
equation1.  Each individual’s HRi was estimated by log-log regression fit across CTT risk 
categories for individuals without vascular disease2. We applied 5-year HR estimates from 
CTT throughout the 10-year period by assuming proportional hazards.  The boundaries of 
CTT’s categories of 5-year risk (5%, 10%, and 20%) of cardiovascular events including 
revascularizations were converted to 10-year risk of cardiovascular events (8.8%, 17.1%, 
and 32.5% respectively) excluding revascularizations by assuming 39% of CTT 
revascularizations were isolated CVD events (i.e. no ASCVD event other than  
revascularization) based on San Antonio Heart Study data3. We also performed sensitivity 
analyses assuming (1) 0% revascularization were isolated and (2) 100% revascularizations 
were isolated.  The results of these sensitivity analyses had modest effects on the 
individual RRR estimates and did not materially change the results of the overall analysis.  
The CTT HR for each risk category was fit to the midpoint of the PCE range resulting in the 
following smoothing equation: [Ln(HRi) = -0.10821 + 0.12346*Ln(R0), R-square = 0.86, risk 
coefficient p = 0.023].

 Identifying Statin Trial Inclusion Criteria in NHANES  
For the present analysis, we included trials based on the Cochrane collaboration’s 
systematic review of randomized statin trials in primary prevention (which identified 18 
randomized trials)1:  (1) placebo-controlled;  (2) >1000 participants randomized; (3) ≥ 2 
years of follow-up; (3) <10% prevalent cardiovascular disease at baseline (or which 
provided relative risk reductions for this subgroup); and (5) demonstrated a statistically 
significant event reduction for a clinical vascular outcome.  Since we were comparing a 
risk-based approach to a trial-based approach, we excluded trials performed exclusively 
in diabetics since all diabetics age 40-75 with LDL-C > 70 mg/dl are considered statin-
eligible regardless of predicted risk. Based on these criteria, we identified 5 trials that 
defined the major statin benefit groups:  AFCAPS/TexCAPS2, WOSCOPS3, MEGA4, 
ASCOT-LLA5 and JUPITER6. From each reported trial, we developed a set of inclusion 
criteria, which could be specifically identified from any available NHANES variable. We 
then employed a process of successive elimination by all these criteria to develop a 
detailed identification of all individuals who met all inclusion criteria for each trial. We 
then limited these detailed criteria to those which successively excluded more than an 
additional 1% of the sample of 71.8 million to develop a conservative algorithm which 
was applied to the NHANES sample to determine maximal statin-eligibility based on 
randomized treatment benefit groups (Supplementary Figure 1).  For an individual to be 
statin trial eligible, they were required to meet the inclusion criteria of at least 1 of the 
5 statin trials  .

American primary prevention candidates  (without clinical ASCVD, with valid LDL-C < 
190 mg/dl, non-diabetic, age 40–75, not taking cholesterol-lowering medication, and with 
all values required for pooled cohort equation risk calculation) by our algorithm which 
identified subjects meeting any trial’s core entry criteria. An estimated 23.1 million 
residents identified as eligible by detailed criteria were identified by the algorithm 
(sensitivity = 100%). The algorithm correctly identified  47.1 million residents not eligible 
for any trial and incorrectly identified  1.6 million as eligible who were excluded by more 
detailed criteria (specificity = 97%).  The algorithm proposed by Ridker et al3 had a 
sensitivity of 64% and specificity of 63% in this category.
