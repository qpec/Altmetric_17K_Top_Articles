In Brief
Using transgenic and gene-targeted
mice, Valente et al. show that PUMA-
mediated apoptosis, and not cell-cycle
arrest or senescence mediated by p21, is
critical for the therapeutic responses of
both non-transformed and malignant
lymphoid cells to the p53-activating
compound Nutlin3a.

SUMMARY
Nutlin3a is a small-molecule antagonist of MDM2
that promotes non-genotoxic activation of p53
through p53 protein stabilization and transactivation
of p53 target genes. Nutlin3a is the forerunner of a
class of cancer therapeutics that have reached
clinical trials. Using transgenic and gene-targeted
mouse models lacking the critical p53 target genes,
p21, Puma, and Noxa, we found that only loss of
PUMA
conferred
profound
protection
against
Nutlin3a-induced killing in both non-transformed
lymphoid cells and Em-Myc lymphomas in vitro
and in vivo. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated targeting of
the PUMA gene rendered human hematopoietic
cancer cell lines markedly resistant to Nutlin3a-
induced cell death. These results demonstrate that
PUMA-mediated apoptosis, but not p21-mediated
cell-cycle arrest or senescence, is a critical determi-
nant of the therapeutic response to non-genotoxic
p53 activation by Nutlin3a. Importantly, in human
cancer, PUMA expression may predict patient re-
sponses to treatment with MDM2 antagonists.
INTRODUCTION
The tumor suppressor p53 is a transcription factor capable of
modulating activity in a wide range of cellular processes through
its regulation of recognized target genes. p53 is activated post-
translationally in response to diverse cellular stressors, such as
DNA damage, hypoxia, and activation of oncogenic proteins
(Riley et al., 2008). In unstressed cells, the levels of p53 protein
are kept low as a result of an auto-regulatory negative-feedback
loop involving the E3 ubiquitin ligase, MDM2, which targets p53
for proteasomal degradation (Vogelstein et al., 2000).
Many frequently used anti-cancer therapeutics kill tumor
cells by inducing DNA damage, which activates p53. This, in
turn, causes the induction of downstream target genes, with
consequent activation of effector processes that limit tumor
expansion by inducing cell-cycle arrest, senescence, or death.
Studies utilizing gene-targeted mice have identified the down-
stream effectors critical for the induction of these processes.
The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CDKI) p21 is critical
for p53-mediated G1/S cell-cycle arrest and senescence (Bru-
garolas et al., 1995; Chang et al., 1999; Deng et al., 1995),
whereas the BH3-only proteins PUMA and (to a lesser extent)
NOXA are required for the induction of apoptosis (Jeffers et al.,
2003; Oda et al., 2000; Shibue et al., 2003; Villunger et al.,
2003).
While �50% of all human cancers bear mutations in p53, many
other cancers utilize indirect mechanisms to silence p53 tumor
growth suppressive pathways, such as MDM2 gene amplifica-
tion (Freedman et al., 1999; Momand et al., 1998). Thus, target-
ing the MDM2-p53 interaction constitutes an exciting approach
for the design of non-genotoxic anti-cancer therapeutics.
Nutlin3a, is the forerunner of this class of compounds. By binding
within the p53 interaction site on MDM2, Nutlin3a inhibits p53
ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, thereby promoting
stabilization and activation of p53, with consequent induction of
downstream effector processes (Efeyan et al., 2007; Vassilev
et al., 2004). While genetic studies revealed the processes medi-
ating tumor regression in response to acute p53 restoration
(Martins et al., 2006; Ventura et al., 2007; Xue et al., 2007), and
microarray gene expression analyses have provided insight
into which target genes are expressed after Nutlin3a treatment
(Tovar et al., 2006; Vassilev et al., 2004), it remains unclear
which p53 target genes are essential for Nutlin3a’s therapeutic
activity.

 We utilized gene-targeted mice lacking critical p53 target
genes, or human hematopoietic cancer cell lines targeted with
CRISPR/Cas9, to define the pathways activated by p53 that
are critical for Nutlin3a’s therapeutic effects. Our results demon-
strate that apoptotic pathways initiated by the BH3-only protein
PUMA, but not anti-proliferative pathways mediated by the
CDKI p21, are responsible for Nutlin3a’s therapeutic activity in
lymphoid malignancies.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Nutlin3a Activates p53 Target Gene Expression
and Causes Cell-Cycle Arrest and Apoptosis in
Non-transformed Mouse Lymphoid Cells In Vitro
First, we assessed the impact of Nutlin3a on non-transformed
cells. Accumulation of p53 protein and the p53 targets, PUMA
and p21, was readily detectable at the protein (Figure 1A) and
mRNA level (Puma, Noxa, p21, and Mdm2; Figure 1B) in wild-
type (WT) but not p53�/� thymocytes after 8-hr treatment.

promoted
p53-dependent
G1/S-phase
cell-cycle arrest in mitogen-stimulated proliferating WT T cells,
evidenced by an �50% decrease in the S-phase population (Fig-
ure 1C). In CD4+CD8+ WT thymocytes (isolated through fluores-
cence-activated
cell
sorting
[FACS]),
Nutlin3a
promoted
apoptosis with >90% cell death within 24 hr, whereas p53�/�
thymocytes were protected (Figure 1D). Lymphocytes overex-
pressing the pro-survival gene BCL2 (Ogilvy et al., 1999) were
resistant to Nutlin3a, indicating that death was mediated by
the intrinsic apoptotic pathway (Figure S1). At 24 hr, a small sub-
set (�5%–20%) of p53�/� cells had undergone apoptosis,
whereas vav-Bcl2 lymphocytes remained completely protected
(Figure S1). This finding is, perhaps, explained by previous
studies reporting that Nutlin3a can induce a p53-independent
genotoxic response in cancer cells, evidenced by the appear-
ance of gH2AX foci (a marker of double-stranded DNA [dsDNA]
breaks), albeit to a much lesser extent than that induced by DNA-
damage-inducing drugs (Rigatti et al., 2012; Valentine et al.,
2011; Verma et al., 2010).
Nutlin3a-Mediated Killing of Non-transformed Mouse
Lymphoid Cells In Vitro Requires PUMA, but Not p21
Next, we analyzed lymphoid cells from a panel of gene-targeted
mice lacking single or multiple downstream p53 effectors. Doses
of 4 mM Nutlin3a induced complete killing of diverse lymphoid
cell populations from WT, p21�/�, and Noxa�/� mice, but not
p53�/� mice, within 24 hr (Figure 1E). Puma�/� cells exhibited
comparable resistance to p53�/� cells after 8 hr of treatment
(Figure 1E). Interestingly, at 24 hr, significantly lower protection
was seen in the Puma�/� cells (albeit still much higher than in
WT cells) (Figure 1E).
Analysis of lymphocytes from Puma�/�Noxa�/� mice showed
that loss of NOXA did not further enhance the resistance to
Nutlin3a afforded by the loss of PUMA. This contrasts with pre-
vious studies in which NOXA was shown to contribute, albeit to a
lesser extent, to p53- and p63-mediated apoptosis induced by
g-irradiation or DNA-damaging anti-cancer therapeutics (Kerr
et al., 2012; Michalak et al., 2008; Villunger et al., 2003) (Fig-
ure 1E). Lymphoid cells from Puma�/�p21�/� mice exhibited
resistance to Nutlin3a comparable to that of the Puma�/� cells,
demonstrating that loss of p21 cannot provide a protective effect
against Nutlin3a-induced cell killing, even in the context of
PUMA deficiency (Figure 1E).
In proliferating T cells, the loss of p21 significantly reduced
Nutlin3a-induced cell-cycle arrest, comparable to the reduction
seen in p53�/� T lymphoblasts, but PUMA deficiency had no
such impact (Figures 1E and 1F). Notably, although p21�/� T
lymphoblasts did not undergo cell-cycle arrest, they remained
normally sensitive to Nutlin3a-induced killing. In contrast, T lym-
phoblasts lacking PUMA or p53 were almost entirely resistant to
Nutlin3a-induced killing (Figure 1G).
Our finding that loss of p21 fails to impact Nutlin3a-induced
apoptosis is in contrast to previous studies, which suggested
a role for p21 in inhibiting p53-mediated apoptosis (induced
by DNA-damage-inducing compounds) (Gartel and Tyner,
2002; Ja
¨ nicke et al., 2007; Tian et al., 2000), but they are
consistent with a report that dysregulated expression of p21
(overexpression or knockdown) had no impact on Nutlin3a-
induced apoptosis in human cancer-derived cell lines. This
suggests
that
p21’s
ability
to
modulate
p53-mediated
apoptosis may depend on the presence of DNA damage (Xia
et al., 2011).
Loss of PUMA, but Not Loss of p21, Protects
Non-transformed Mouse Lymphoid Cells against
Nutlin3a-Induced Killing In Vivo
Next, we treated mice lacking various p53 downstream effector
genes with Nutlin3a. Nutlin3a was shown to be well tolerated
in mice, with no weight loss or gross abnormalities (beyond
lymphocyte depletion) observed after treatment with 200 mg/kg
Nutlin3a for 20 days (Tovar et al., 2006; Vassilev et al.,
2004). Similarly, we observed no evidence of weight loss,
thrombocytopenia, or anemia in our Nutlin3a-treated mice
(Figure S2A).
In response to Nutlin3a treatment, upregulation of the p53
target genes p21, Puma, and Noxa was readily observed in
thymic and lymph node extracts from WT, but not p53�/�,
mice (Figure 2A; Figure S2B). In WT mice, Nutlin3a treatment
reduced thymocyte numbers by �90% (Figure 2B) and mature
T lymphocyte numbers in the lymph nodes by 50%–60% (Fig-
ure S2C). Loss of p21 did not protect against Nutlin3a in vivo,
with an �65% reduction of thymocytes recorded in Nutlin3a-
treated p21�/� mice (Figure 2B), but it provided minor (albeit
significant) protection against loss of mature T and B lympho-
cytes from lymph nodes (Figure S2C). This protection was,

 however, considerably less than the complete protection pro-
vided by loss of PUMA or p53 (Figure S2C). Loss of NOXA
did not provide resistance to Nutlin3a-induced depletion of
thymocytes or mature T and B lymphocytes (Figure 2B;
Figure S2C).
Histological TUNEL analysis (which reveals dsDNA breaks, a
marker of apoptosis) showed that Nutlin3a treatment caused
extensive alterations in the thymic architecture of WT mice, but
not p53�/� mice, with extensive accumulation of TUNEL+ cells,
predominantly within the cortex (Figure 2C). Nutlin3a-treated
p21�/� mice showed a similar increase in the numbers of
TUNEL+ cells in their thymi, as was seen in WT animals (Fig-
ure 2C). In contrast, thymi of Nutlin3a-treated Puma�/� mice
contained only a few TUNEL+ cells (Figure 2C). Large increases
in the numbers of TUNEL+ cells were also observed in the lymph
nodes of WT and p21�/� mice, but not in those of Puma�/� or
p53�/� mice (Figure S2D). The minor ‘‘protective’’ effect pro-
vided by the loss of p21 in the lymph nodes may, therefore, be
due to failure to induce proliferative arrest after p53 activation
rather than a direct effect on apoptosis. Notably, p21 has been
shown to play a critical role in the inhibition of T cell proliferation
after mitogen plus cytokine (concanavaline A [ConA] and inter-
leukin-2 [IL-2]) stimulation (Balomenos et al., 2000). Collectively,
these results demonstrate that losses of lymphoid cells induced
by Nutlin3a in vitro and in vivo are primarily driven by PUMA-
mediated apoptosis.
Malignant Em-Myc Lymphoma Cells Are Markedly More
Sensitive to Nutlin3a Compared to Non-transformed
Lymphoid Cells
To investigate the p53 effector processes critical for Nutlin3a’s
therapeutic effects on malignant cells, we utilized the Em-Myc
transgenic mouse model (Adams et al., 1985). In these mice, de-
regulated MYC expression, found in �70% of human cancers

(Boxer and Dang, 2001), causes a pre-
leukemic expansion of cycling pre-B
cells, which, upon acquisition of cooper-
ating oncogenic mutations, progress to clonal pre-B or sIg+ B
cell lymphomas (Adams et al., 1985).
Initially, we compared the sensitivity to Nutlin3a treatment in
culture between pre-leukemic and malignant lymphoid cells
from Em-Myc mice and their non-transformed WT counterparts.
Both pre-leukemic Em-Myc pre-B and B cells and malignant
Em-Myc lymphomas were markedly more sensitive to Nutlin3a
than non-transformed mouse B lymphoid cells. This suggests
that dysregulated MYC expression alone(and notthetransformed
state) sensitizes lymphoid cells to Nutlin3a-induced killing (Fig-
ure 3A). Notably, >90% of WT non-transformed B lymphoid cells
remained viable after 4 hr of exposure to doses of Nutlin3a that
were able to kill >70% of the pre-leukemic as well as malignant
lymphoma cells from Em-Myc mice (Figure 3A). This suggests
that it may be possible to define a therapeutic window for drugs
that activate p53 via non-genotoxic processes in which malignant
lymphoid cells are killed efficiently without inducing unacceptable
losses of normal lymphoid (and other) cell types.
Nutlin3a Promotes p53 Accumulation and Downstream
Effector Pathway Activation in Em-Myc Lymphoma Cells
In Vitro
Western blot analysis revealed that Nutlin3a treatment promoted
the accumulation of p53 protein within 4 hr, with co-incident in-
crease of its downstream targets—PUMA and p21—in Em-Myc
lymphoma-derived cell lines with confirmed WT p53 pathway ac-
tivity, but not in Em-Myc;p53�/� lymphomas (Figure 3B; Fig-
ure S3A). Accordingly, real-time qPCR analysis demonstrated
that Nutlin3a caused a p53-dependent increase in the levels of
the p53 target genes, Puma, Noxa, p21, and Mdm2, in several in-
dependent Em-Myc lymphoma cell lines, but not in Em-Myc;
p53�/� lymphoma cells (Figure 3C).
Low doses of Nutlin3a were sufficient to cause rapid apoptosis
in Em-Myc lymphoma cell lines with WT p53, with 80%–90% cell

 death after 12 hr, whereas <5% killing was seen in Em-Myc;
p53�/� lymphoma cells (Figure 3D; Figure S3B). Prior to cell
death, Nutlin3a induced cell-cycle arrest (60%–70% decreases
in the proportions of S-phase cells) in Em-Myc but not in
Em-Myc;p53�/� lymphoma cells (Figure 3E).
PUMA, but Not p21, Is Critical for Nutlin3a-Induced
Killing of Em-Myc Lymphoma Cells In Vitro
Next, we utilized lymphoma-derived cell lines from Em-Myc
mice, which had been crossed to mice lacking the p53 down-
stream targets PUMA, NOXA, or p21, and tested their response
to Nutlin3a in culture. Although Em-Myc;p21�/� lymphoma lines
did not undergo G1-S boundary cell-cycle arrest upon treat-
ment with Nutlin3a, they were killed as efficiently as control
Em-Myc cell lines (Figures 3D and 3E). In contrast, Em-Myc;
Puma�/� lymphoma lines retained the ability to undergo cell-
cycle arrest but were resistant to Nutlin3a-induced killing,
with �60% of cells remaining viable after 12 hr of treatment,
when most (>95%) Em-Myc, Em-Myc;p21�/�, and Em-Myc;
Noxa�/� lymphoma cells had died (Figures 3D and 3E).
Notably, there was a significant difference in viability between
Em-Myc;Puma�/� and Em-Myc;p53�/� lymphoma lines, with
the latter showing <5% killing after 12-hr Nutlin3a treatment
(Figure 3D).
Loss of PUMA, but not Loss of p21, Impairs Regression
of Em-Myc Lymphomas in Response to Nutlin3a In Vivo
Then, we transduced Em-Myc lymphoma lines with a lentiviral
GFP-luciferase construct and transplanted them into non-
irradiated C57BL/6 albino mice (Kelly et al., 2014). Once
tumors were established, lymphoma-bearing mice were treated
with Nutlin3a or vehicle twice daily for 3 days, and tumor
growth
was
monitored
using
live
imaging
of
luciferase
bioluminescence.
All Em-Myc lymphomas tested progressed at a similar rate in
the absence of Nutlin3a treatment (Figure 3F). In contrast,
Em-Myc (control) lymphomas treated with Nutlin3a regressed
substantially, with almost complete disappearance of the lym-
phoma (luciferase signal) observed after 72 hr of treatment
(Figures 3F and 3G). Loss of p21 did not impair the therapeutic
impact of Nutlin3a (Figures 3F and 3G). In striking contrast,
Em-Myc;Puma�/�
lymphomas
were
markedly
resistant
to
Nutlin3a treatment, with mice bearing such lymphomas retaining
a similar tumor burden when compared to pre-treatment values
(Figures 3F and 3G). However, Em-Myc;Puma�/� lymphomas
progressed
more
slowly
in
Nutlin3a-treated
recipients,
compared to their vehicle-treated controls, suggesting that, while
PUMA-mediated apoptosis is critical for the regression of
lymphoid malignancies in response to Nutlin3a treatment, this
drug can impair lymphoma growth through additional processes
(Figures 3F and 3G). It is, however, important to note that, in other
tumors, such as solid cancers, p21-mediated growth arrest/
senescence might contribute to the therapeutic impact of
Nutlin3a. Indeed, previous studies showed that acute restoration
of p53 in spontaneously arising sarcomas and mutant HrasV12D-
driven murine liver carcinomas resulted in tumor regression in the
absence of apoptosis, but with the appearance of markers of
senescence (Martins et al., 2006; Ventura et al., 2007).
PUMA Contributes to Nutlin3a-Induced Apoptosis in
Human Hematopoietic-Tumor-Derived Cell Lines
In Vitro
Next, we tested whether PUMA is a critical determinant of
Nutlin3a-induced killing of tumor cells in human neoplastic
disease. We evaluated a panel of human hematopoietic-tumor-
derived cell lines of different sub-types, including myeloid leuke-
mia, multiple myeloma, and Burkitt lymphoma (Figure 4A), each
of which with known p53 status (Petitjean et al., 2007). Nutlin3a
efficiently induced apoptosis in all cell lines tested with wild-type
p53, but not in those harboring p53 mutations, and this killing
could be prevented by the caspase inhibitor QVD-OPH (Fig-
ure 4B; Figure S4). Nutlin3a treatment caused induction of
TP53 protein, PUMA, and p21 in all WT p53 human hematopoi-
etic-cancer-derived cell lines, but not in the p53 mutated BL41
cell line (Figure 4C).
To test the contribution of PUMA to Nutlin3a-induced
apoptosis, we used an inducible CRISPR/Cas9 platform to
target the PUMA gene in our human cancer lines (Aubrey et al.,
2015). Deletion of PUMA impaired induction of apoptosis in all
three p53 WT cell lines evaluated, as compared to the non-tar-
geting small guide RNA (sgRNA) transduced control cells (Fig-
ure 4D). Given that the cell survival experiments were performed
on a polyclonal population of cells, the gene deletion across the
whole-cell population may not be complete; therefore, the pro-
tection likely represents an underestimate of the true impact of
loss of PUMA. Efficient targeting of PUMA was confirmed by
western blot analysis showing loss of induction of the WT
PUMA protein, while induction of p53 protein and its target,
p21, remained intact (Figure 4E). Taken together, these results
indicate that PUMA-mediated apoptosis is a critical mediator
of the therapeutic response of human hematopoietic cancer
cells to Nutlin3a.
Interestingly, across multiple cellular contexts, and in both
human and mouse cells, the protection from Nutlin3a-induced
cell death afforded by loss of PUMA was not complete (Figures
1E, 3D, 3F, 3G, and 4D). This indicates that additional processes
can contribute to Nutlin3a-induced tumor regression. The pro-
apoptotic BH3-only protein BIM may be an interesting candi-
date, since the combined loss of BIM, along with PUMA and
NOXA, fully protects Em-Myc lymphoma cells against DNA-dam-
age-induced, p53-dependent killing (Happo et al., 2010) and
since BIM loss provides non-transformed thymocytes with minor
protection against etoposide (Bouillet et al., 1999; Erlacher et al.,
2006). Since the Bim gene does not have an obvious p53-binding
site (Bouillet et al., 2001), it may be activated indirectly by this
tumor suppressor.
In conclusion, the results from this study demonstrate that
induction of apoptosis by PUMA, but not induction of G1/S
cell-cycle arrest by p21, is essential for p53-dependent
Nutlin3a-induced killing of non-transformed murine lymphoid
cells as well as malignant murine or human hematopoietic
cells. Since a pro-apoptotic BH3-only protein, PUMA, is critical
for the therapeutic impact of Nutlin3a, it may be possible to
boost its therapeutic efficacy by the addition of BH3 mimetic
drugs, such as ABT-263 (Navitoclax) or ABT-199, which inhibit
BCL-2, BCL-XL plus BCL-W, or BCL-2 alone, respectively
(Czabotar et al., 2014).

 EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Materials
Nutlin3a was provided by Roche Pharmaceuticals (Vassilev et al., 2004). For
in vitro use, lyophilized Nutlin3a was dissolved in DMSO; for in vivo use,
Nutlin3a was formulated in vehicle (2% Klucel, 0.5% Tween 80) and adminis-
tered at 200 mg/kg body weight per dose by oral gavage twice daily for
1–3 days. For cells used for western blot or real-time qPCR analysis, 25 mM
of the caspase inhibitor QVD-OPH (MP Biomedicals) was added 1 hr prior to
the addition of cytotoxic drugs.
Mice
All experiments with mice followed the guidelines of the Melbourne Direc-
torate Animal Ethics Committee. C57BL/6 mice were obtained from the
Walter and Eliza Hall Institute’s breeding facility. Generation and genotyping
of mice deficient for p21 (Deng et al., 1995); NOXA, PUMA (Villunger et al.,
2003); both PUMA and NOXA (Michalak et al., 2008); both PUMA and p21
(Valente et al., 2013); or p53 (Jacks et al., 1994) and Em-Myc transgenic
mice (Adams et al., 1985) have been described. All mice were kept on a
C57BL/6 background, generated either on this background using C57BL/
6-derived embryonic stem (ES) cells (Puma�/� and Noxa�/�) or on a mixed
C57BL/6x129SV background using 129SV-derived ES cells and back-
crossed with C57BL/6 mice for >12 generations (p21�/�, p53�/�). Em-Myc
transgenic mice lacking BH3-only proteins were generated as described in
the Supplemental Experimental Procedures.

Cell-Viability Assays
Non-transformed CD4+CD8+ thymocytes; CD4+
and CD8+ T lymphocytes; and B220+sIg� pre-B
and B220+sIg+ mature B cells were FACS sorted
from the thymus, lymph nodes, and bone marrow,
respectively.
Non-transformed
lymphoid
cells,
Em-Myc lymphoma cell lines, and human hemato-
poietic cancer cell lines were treated with the
indicated concentrations of compound, and cell
viability was assessed by FACS after staining with fluorescein isothiocyanate
(FITC)-conjugated Annexin V plus propidium iodide (PI; 2 mg/ml, Sigma); note
that, for human cancer cell lines, PI alone was used to assess cell viability.
Cell viability was expressed as percent Annexin-VnegativePInegative cells (or
PInegative for human cells) relative to untreated controls.
Cell-Cycle Analysis
Mitogen-stimulated T cell lymphoblasts were generated as described in the
Supplemental Experimental Procedures. Proliferating T cells and Em-Myc lym-
phoma lines were treated with the indicated concentrations of Nutlin3a or
DMSO (control). Cell-cycle distribution was assessed by PI staining and
FACS analysis (Riccardi and Nicoletti, 2006).
Western Blot and Real-Time qPCR Analyses
Total cell protein extracts were prepared in either ONYX or RIPA buffer, supple-
mented with complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). The antibodies listed
here in parentheses were used to detect the following proteins: for detection of
mouse proteins, p21 (C-19; Santa Cruz Biotechnology); p53 (CM5; Novacas-
tra); PUMA (ab27669; Abcam); MDM2 (sc812; Santa Cruz Biotech); and
p19ARF (5.C3.1; Rockland Antibodies and Assays). For detection of human
proteins: p21 (ab7960; Abcam); p53 (FL-393) (sc-6243; Santa Cruz Biotech-
nology); PUMA (ab27669, Abcam); and HSP70 (both mouse and human, clone
N6; a gift from Dr. R. Anderson, Peter MacCallum Cancer Research Institute).
Total RNA was isolated from cells using TRIzol (Invitrogen) and reverse tran-
scribed using SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) and Oligo-d(T)

 primers. Real-time qPCR was performed in triplicate using Taqman Gene
Expression assays (Applied Biosystems) and an ABI 7900 Real-Time PCR
Machine (Applied Biosystems). mRNA expression levels were standardized
by comparison to the transcript levels of the reference gene, Hmbs, based
on the comparative threshold method (DDCt).
In Vivo Treatment Studies
Age-matched mice were treated for 1 day (two doses) with 200 mg/kg body
weight Nutlin3a or vehicle. Total organ cell counts were determined, and
leukocyte subset distribution was determined as described previously
(Strasser et al., 1991) by FACS analysis after staining with surface-marker-spe-
cific monoclonal antibodies that had been coupled to FITC, R-phycoerythrin
(R-PE), or allophycocyanin (APC). From this, total cell population counts
were calculated.
Em-Myc lymphoma-derived cell lines were transduced with a lentiviral
FUL2tG expression construct (driving co-expression of GFP and luciferase)
(Kelly et al., 2014). Cells transduced with the construct (GFP+) were sorted,
and 1 3 106 cells (in 200 ml PBS) injected intravenously (i.v.) into C57BL/6 al-
bino recipient mice. Tumor growth was monitored by live imaging using the
IVIS Spectrum In Vivo Imaging System (PerkinElmer) to detect luciferase biolu-
minescence. When lymphoma burden was sufficiently high (�7 days post-in-
jection, photon flux per second of >1 3 108), mice were treated with 200 mg/kg
body weight Nutlin3a or vehicle twice daily for 3 days, and tumor growth was
monitored at the indicated time points.
Histology and TUNEL Staining
Organs from Nutlin3a- or vehicle-treated mice were harvested at 8 hr and fixed
in 10% formalin prior to sectioning. TUNEL staining was performed as previ-
ously described (Michalak et al., 2008).
CRISPR/Cas9-Mediated PUMA Gene Disruption
PUMA knockout cell lines were generated using a previously described in-
ducible lentiviral CRISPR/Cas9 platform (Aubrey et al., 2015). Lentivirus was
produced using packaging constructs pRSV-rev, pMDL, and pVSV-G, as pre-
viously described (Aubrey et al., 2015). We used inducible sgRNAs targeting
exon 3 (50- GCCGCTCGTACTGTGCGTTG-30) of the PUMA gene or a non-tar-
geting sgRNA (50-GACAATTGCAGCCTGCTGAG-30). Stable, constitutive,
lentivirus-mediated Cas9 expression, reported by mCherry fluorescent protein
expression, was achieved as previously described (Aubrey et al., 2015). Induc-
ible sgRNA lentiviral vectors were used, and their presence was reported by
EGFP expression. mCherry and eGFP double-positive cells were isolated us-
ing FACS sorting in an Influx flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). Whole-cell
populations were treated for 1 week with doxycycline hyclate (Sigma-Aldrich,
D9891), at a final concentration of 1 mg/ml to induce expression of the PUMA-
targeting or non-targeting control sgRNA. To confirm correct PUMA gene tar-
geting, selected samples were assessed using the MiSeq Indel sequencing
platform as previously described (Aubrey et al., 2015) (data not shown).
Statistical Analysis
Prism (Version 5; GraphPad) software was used for all statistical analyses.
Two-group comparisons were made using two-tailed Student’s t tests
assuming equal variances. Comparisons between multiple groups were
made using One-way ANOVA (Tukey’s multiple comparison test/Kruskal-
Wallis test). p values < 0.05 were considered to indicate statistical significance.
