The susceptibility to autoimmune diseases is affected by genetic and
environmental factors. In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the shared epi-
tope (SE), a five-amino acid sequence motif encoded by RA-associated
HLA-DRB1 alleles, is the single most significant genetic risk factor. The
risk conferred by the SE is increased in a multiplicative way by expo-
sure to various environmental pollutants, such as cigarette smoke.
The mechanism of this synergistic interaction is unknown. It is worth
noting that the SE has recently been found to act as a signal trans-
duction ligand that facilitates differentiation of Th17 cells and osteo-
clasts in vitro and in vivo. Intriguingly, the aryl hydrocarbon receptor
(AhR), a transcription factor that mediates the xenobiotic effects of
many pollutants, including tobacco combustion products, has been
found to activate similar biologic effects. Prompted by these similar-
ities, we sought to determine whether the SE and AhR signaling
pathways interact in autoimmune arthritis. Here we uncovered a
nuclear factor kappa B-mediated synergistic interaction between
the SE and AhR pathways that leads to markedly enhanced osteoclast
differentiation and Th17 polarization in vitro. Administration of AhR
pathway agonists to transgenic mice carrying human SE-coding al-
leles resulted in a robust increase in arthritis severity, bone destruc-
tion, overabundance of osteoclasts, and IL17-expressing cells in the
inflamed joints and draining lymph nodes of arthritic mice. Thus,
this study identifies a previously unrecognized mechanism of gene–
environment interaction that could provide insights into the well-
described but poorly understood amplification of the genetic risk for
RA upon exposure to environmental pollutants.

illions of people are afflicted with autoimmune diseases,
and many more are at risk for developing such disorders.
The etiology of autoimmunity is incompletely understood, but
there is strong evidence that both genetic and environmental
factors play a role (1–3). Over the years, there has been growing
realization that genes and environment may interact in autoim-
munity in an additive or multiplicative fashion. One condition in
which such interaction is apparent is rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
Recent evidence indicates that the risk of developing this com-
mon disease is significantly amplified in genetically susceptible
individuals who have been exposed to various environmental
pollutants (4–6).
The mechanisms governing the genetic and environmental risks
for RA, let alone the synergism between these two factors, are
presently unknown. Two-thirds of RA risk is attributed to genetic
factors, primarily the HLA-DRB1 locus. The vast majority of RA
patients carry particular HLA-DRB1 alleles that encode a five-
amino acid sequence motif called the shared epitope (SE) in the
third allelic hypervariable region of the HLA-DRβ chain (7). The
SE is the strongest genetic risk factor for severe RA known to
date, but its mechanism of action in RA is unknown.
Over the past few years we have gained important new insights
into the functional role of the SE in RA (8–23). Our findings
indicate that the SE, located near the tip of a prominent fold in
the DRβ chain (15), acts as a ligand that interacts with cell
surface calreticulin (CRT) (11, 13, 14). SE-activated signaling
depends also on CRT transmembrane coreceptor, CD91 (also
known as LRP1) (11). Activation of this pathway leads to Th17
polarization and increased osteoclast (OC) differentiation and
activity, both in vitro and in vivo (12, 17, 20). Importantly, the SE
signaling effects are independent of its role in antigen pre-
sentation, do not involve interaction with T-cell receptors, and
can be seen with natural, cell surface-expressed HLA-DR mol-
ecules, or physiologically folded cell-free HLA-DR tetramers,
as well as soluble synthetic peptides or peptidomimetics ex-
pressing the SE sequence motif. When administered to mice with
collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), synthetic SE ligands enhanced
arthritis severity and bone damage (17, 20).
In addition to genetic predisposition, environmental factors
significantly influence RA susceptibility as well. For example, the
prevalence of RA is higher in urban populations, and the disease
is associated with exposure to environmental pollutants, such as
dioxin-like compounds (24) and tobacco smoke (25). Further-
more, cigarette smoke increases the disease risk of SE-positive
individuals in a multiplicative, dose-dependent fashion (26, 27).
The mechanistic basis of this gene–environment interaction
is unknown.
One of the theories concerning the impact of environmental
pollutants on autoimmunity is focused on the aryl hydrocarbon
Significance
This study identifies a mechanistic basis for the enigmatic,
long-observed interaction between the rheumatoid arthritis
shared epitope (SE)—the most significant genetic risk factor in
this disease—and exposure to environmental pollutants, such
as cigarette smoke. Specifically, we show that the SE, acting as
a signal transduction ligand, cooperates with the aryl hydro-
carbon receptor-activated pathway, and together facilitate
cellular events that culminate in inflammation and bone
destruction in experimental autoimmune arthritis. The cross-
talk between the two pathways is mediated by nuclear
factor kappa B.

 receptor (AhR) (24), an intracellular ligand-activated transcrip-
tion factor that mediates the effects of various polycyclic aro-
matic hydrocarbons, including dioxin and tobacco combustion
products. Intriguingly, reminiscent of the SE ligand, AhR ago-
nists have been shown to perturb the balance between regulatory
T (Treg) cells and Th17 cells (28) and activate OCs (29).
Moreover, the AhR pathway has been implicated in the patho-
genesis of autoimmune diseases (30–32).
Prompted by these parallels, here we sought to determine
whether the SE and AhR pathways interact functionally in in-
flammatory arthritis. Our findings show that the SE ligand and
AhR agonists operate synergistically and together markedly en-
hance OC and Th17 cell differentiation and exacerbate disease
severity and bone destruction in CIA. The cross-talk between the
two pathways is mediated by nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB).
Results
Synergistic Proosteoclastogenic Interaction Between the SE and AhR
Pathways in Vitro. OC-mediated bone destruction is a major dis-
ease severity factor in RA (33). Since the SE and AhR agonists
have been independently shown to facilitate OC differentiation,
we first undertook to determine whether the two pathways co-
operate during OC differentiation in vitro. To this end we
studied transgenic (Tg) mice that express on their cell surface
SE-positive human HLA-DR molecules with a 70-QKRAA-74
SE sequence in the DRβ chain, coded by the HLA-DRB1*04:01
allele (34) (referred to herein as “0401 Tg”). As control, we
studied similar background mice expressing SE-negative (70-
DERAA-74) HLA-DR molecules, whose β-chain is coded by the
allele HLA-DRB1*04:02 (“0402 Tg”). When exposed to the AhR
agonists 6-formylindolo[3,2-b]carbazole (FICZ) (Fig. 1A) or
2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) (Fig. 1B), bone
marrow cells (BMCs) from SE-positive 0401 Tg mice, but not the
SE-negative 0402 Tg, displayed significantly (P < 0.0001 by two-
way ANOVA) facilitated OC differentiation [F(1, 8) = 92.01 for
FICZ; F(1, 10) = 70.91 for TCDD]. A similar pattern was seen in
another HLA-DRB1*04:01 Tg mouse line on a B10.M back-
ground (35) (Fig. S1). Thus, an in vivo-expressed SE specifically
augments the proosteoclastogenic effects of AhR agonists.
To better quantify the interaction, we next addressed the effect
of SE “dose” by analyzing the impact of SE-coding gene zygosity.
To this end, BMCs from HLA-DR1 Tg mice on a B10.M back-
ground (36) with homozygous (SE+/+), heterozygous (SE+/−), or
null (SE−/−) genotype of a SE (70-QRRAA-74)-coding allele
HLA-DRB1*01:01 were cultured under OC differentiation con-
ditions in the presence of different concentrations of FICZ (Fig.
1C) or TCDD (Fig. 1D). A two-way ANOVA analysis indicted a
statistically significant synergistic interaction between AhR agonist
and the SE-coding gene zygosity [F(12, 42) = 10.13] (P < 0.0001)
for FICZ treatment and [F(12, 42) = 2.84] (P < 0.0001) for
TCDD treatment.
As discussed above, the SE signaling effects are independent
of SE’s role in antigen presentation, and can be seen with nat-
urally folded HLA-DR molecules, as well as cell-free synthetic
peptides expressing the SE sequence motif (8, 9, 11, 12, 17, 20).
Consistent with these previous findings, as shown in Fig. 1 E and
F, SE–AhR synergism could be seen in combinatorial dose–response
experiments in which a soluble synthetic SE ligand 65–79*0401
(8) was used in OC differentiation assays in SE-negative mouse
RAW 264.7 cells. The effect of SE ligand–AhR agonist combi-
nations was greater than the arithmetic sum of the effects of
the different agents individually. A two-way ANOVA analysis

Synergistic SE–AhR interaction in osteoclas-
togenesis. BMCs from SE-positive (0401 Tg, triangles)
or SE-negative (0402 Tg, circles) mice were cultured
for 6 d in OC-differentiating medium in the absence
or presence of various concentrations of AhR ago-
nists FICZ (A) or TCDD (B) and the number of OC
(TRAP-positive multinucleated cells) was determined.
(C and D) BMCs from SE homozygous (SE+/+, green),
heterozygous (SE+/−, pink), or null (SE−/−, black) B10.
M-HLA-DR1 (DRB1*01:01) Tg mice were cultured
with various doses of FICZ (C) or TCDD (D) and OCs
were quantified as above. (E and F) RAW 264.7 cells
cultured in OC-differentiating medium in the ab-
sence or presence of various concentrations of the SE

(red) or in combination with AhR agonist plus SE li-
gand (orange/gray). Osteoclastogenic effects of SE–
AhR agonist combinations (gray) which exceed the
arithmetic sum (orange) of the effects by the re-
spective agents alone denote synergism. Multiple
comparison analysis concerning the significance of
the genotype (A and B) and synergism (C–F) was
performed using two-way ANOVA, and shown as P

 revealed significant synergistic interaction between SE and FICZ
[F(9, 32) = 2.65] (P = 0.0204), and between the SE ligand and
TCDD [F(9, 32) = 5.51] (P = 0.0001). Thus, taken together, Fig.
1 demonstrates that the SE ligand, either in its physiological cell
surface conformation, or as a soluble synthetic ligand, interacts
synergistically with AhR agonists to facilitate osteoclastogenesis.
In addition to the effect on osteoclastogenesis, AhR–SE in-
teraction strongly promoted Th17 cell polarization (Fig. 2A). This
interaction was mouse strain independent as it could be seen in
genetically disparate C57BL6 (H2b) and DBA/1 (H2q) mice (Fig.
2B). Additionally, consistent with the known enhancing effect of
tryptophan on AhR-activated Th17 polarization (37), Fig. 2C and
D show that SE–AhR interaction effect on Th17 polarization was
tryptophan dependent. The reason for the paradoxical effect in
tryptophan-deficient media in the presence of the SE ligand (Fig.
2D) is unclear, but could be due to the fact that the SE inhibits the
tryptophan-catabolizing enzyme indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase
(12). One scenario to consider is that under these “double hit”
conditions TCDD produced a paradoxical Th17 differentiation
effect. This question, as well as the in vivo significance of trypto-
phan and its catabolites in Th17 polarization under SE–AhR in-
teraction conditions require further study.
SE–AhR interaction led to synergistic facilitation of in-
flammatory arthritis-related factors. For example, coculturing
RAW 264.7 cells with TCDD and the SE ligand 65–79*0401 led
to markedly enhanced mRNA expression levels of the bone-
destroying cathepsin K (Ctsk) gene (Fig. S2) and to increased
joint tissue protein expression levels of the chemokine (C-C
motif) ligand 2 (Ccl2) (Fig. S3).
A Role for NF-κB. It is worth noting that Ctsk and Ccl2, which
are established markers of OC differentiation (38, 39), are both
up-regulated by NF-κB (40, 41), a pathway which has known
roles in inflammatory arthritis, osteoclastogenesis, and AhR-
activated pathways (40–43). We therefore undertook to exam-
ine the involvement of NF-κB in SE–AhR interaction. As can be
seen in Fig. 3A, the combination of the SE ligand plus TCDD or
FICZ facilitated NF-κB signaling, as evidenced by increased
p65 nuclear translocation. The NF-κB pathway inhibitor wede-
lolactone efficiently blocked the activation. To validate these
findings, RAW 264.7 cells were transiently transfected with an
NF-κB–inducible secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) con-
struct. When these cells were cotreated with the SE ligand and
FICZ, enhanced NF-κB–induced transcriptional activation was
observed. The interaction was completely blocked by cotrans-
fecting cells with a dominant negative IκBαDN construct (Fig.
S4). Together, these findings confirm the role of NF-κB in the
interaction.
We next determined the involvement of NF-κB in SE–AhR
interaction during osteoclastogenesis in BMCs isolated from SE-
positive 0401 Tg and SE-negative 0402 Tg mice (Fig. 3B). There
was only minor effect of AhR agonists on OC differentiation in
BMCs from SE-negative 0402 Tg mice. In contrast, a markedly
enhanced OC differentiation was seen in the SE-positive 0401 Tg
mice. The NF-κB inhibitor wedelolactone blocked AhR–SE
synergism in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 3B). Similar trends
were seen in another Tg mouse line expressing DRB1*04:01-
coded SE-positive DR4 molecules on a B10.M background (Fig.
S5). Thus, we conclude that the interaction between SE and AhR
agonists during osteoclastogenesis is mediated by the NF-κB
signaling pathway.
Synergistic Interaction Between the SE and AhR Pathways in Vivo.
Given the important roles that OC and Th17 cells play in RA and
its experimental models, we proceeded to determine the arthri-
togenic effect of SE–AhR interaction in vivo in HLA-DRB1*04:01
Tg mice on a B10.M background (35). In this model, the SE+/+
genotype confers embryonal lethality; SE−/− mice are resistant to
CIA, while SE+/− mice develop moderately severe erosive arthritis,
thereby offering a suitable system for studying disease-worsening
interventional protocols. As can be seen in Fig. 4, both FICZ and
TCDD significantly facilitated the day of onset (Fig. 4A) and
disease progression (Fig. 4B), and worsened joint swelling (Fig.
4C). Microcomputerized tomography (CT) imaging (Fig. 5 A and
B) and radiologic scores (Fig. 5C) demonstrated significantly
worse bone erosions in SE-positive CIA mice that were treated
with AhR agonists FICZ or TCDD.
Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining of joint
tissues showed increased OC infiltration in AhR agonist-treated
SE-positive mice (Fig. 5 D and E). When cultured ex vivo in OC-
differentiating conditions, BMCs isolated from SE-positive CIA
mice that were treated in vivo with AhR agonists showed a sig-
nificantly more robust osteoclastogenesis (Fig. 5F). Additionally,
synovial tissues from SE-positive, AhR agonists-treated mice
showed significantly higher in situ abundance of IL17 (Fig. S6),
and their spleens and regional lymph nodes had a higher per-
centage of Th17 cells, with a reciprocal decline of Treg cells
compared with SE+-untreated, and SE-treated mice (Fig. S7).
Discussion
This study uncovers a previously unknown mechanistic basis
for gene–environment interaction in autoimmune arthritis. Case
studies have long demonstrated a multiplicative interaction be-
tween SE-coding HLA-DRB1 alleles and cigarette smoking as
risk factors for seropositive RA patients, with dose–effect rela-
tionships for both the SE zygosity and the extent of tobacco
exposure (26, 27). The mechanistic basis of this interaction is
unknown. Prevailing hypothesis for SE–smoking interaction in
RA postulate that cigarette smoke may activate protein citrulli-
nation in the lungs, which in turn can become antigenic in

IMMUNOLOGY AND
INFLAMMATION
 SE-positive individuals with resultant anticitrullinated protein
antibodies (44, 45). One caveat of the lung-centered hypotheses
is the fact that RA risk has been shown to associate with in utero
exposure in nonsmoker offspring of smoking mothers (46) de-
spite the fact that the exposure had happened during a period
when lungs were not yet exposed to air.
The findings presented here uncover an NF-κB–mediated SE–
AhR pathways cross-talk that leads to enhancement of cell differ-
entiation and functional activation of proarthritogenic mechanisms
in vitro, as well as increased disease severity in experimental ar-
thritis in vivo. To the best of our knowledge, this study provides a
unique experimentally validated mechanism of SE interaction with
an environmental factor.
This study offers several notable insights. First, SE–AhR in-
teraction could be documented in OC and Th17 cells, which have
both been previously independently found to play important
roles in the pathogenesis of autoimmune arthritis (4). The in-
teraction was seen in both primary and long-term cultured cells,
derived from several immunogenetically distinct mouse strains.
The effect could be found both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore,
the interactions could be seen with the SE in its cell surface-
expressed, physiologic conformation, and as a soluble cell-free
ligand. This versatility provides internal corroboration and at-
tests to the biologic significance of the discovered mechanism.
Second, the parallels between the interactions found here and
previously reported epidemiologic observations in human RA
are compelling. Similar to the experimental data shown here,
both SE-coding HLA-DRB1 allele dose and the extent of envi-
ronmental exposure have been found to positively impact disease
risk (26, 27). Furthermore, we validated the interaction in two
distinct human HLA-DRB1 alleles, *04:01 and *01:01 (coding for
the two most common SE motif sequences QKRAA and
QRRAA, respectively).
Third, the SE ligand interacted with both exogenous, synthetic
(TCDD) and endogenous, physiological (FICZ) AhR agonists.
These findings are consistent with other studies showing Th17-
polarizing and autoimmune effects by FICZ in experimental
autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) (30) but appear to differ
with some reports concerning TCDD effect (31). The apparent
inconsistency may be due to inherent differences between the
EAE and CIA disease models, in the latter of which the AhR
pathway has been previously implicated as a facilitator of bone
damage (47). Additionally, the apparent inconsistency could be
due to experimental protocol or mouse age and strain differ-
ences. Noteworthy, TCDD dose differences could well explain
the apparent inconsistency. While the in vivo FICZ doses pre-
viously reported in EAE (30) were equivalent to those used here,
and produced similar autoimmune enhancing effects, the study
reporting anti-EAE effects by TCDD (31) used a 166-fold higher
dose than the TCDD dose administered here.
AhR and its agonists have been previously proposed to play a
pathogenic role in RA by activating synovial fibroblasts (48),
dendritic cells (49), macrophages (50), and osteoclasts (51), and

SE–AhR interaction is mediated by NF-κB. (A) Western blot analysis
of NF-κB nuclear translocation. RAW 264.7 cells were treated for 30 min with
or without 50 μg/mL of SE ligand 65–79*0401 (0401) in the presence or ab-
sence of 3 nM of TCDD (Left) or 30 nM of FICZ (Right). LPS was used as a
positive control and wedelolactone (Wed) as an NF-κB pathway inhibitor.
Immunoblots of nuclear (Top two panels) and total (Bottom two panels)
proteins are shown. A representative, one of five independent experiments
is shown. (B) BMCs harvested from SE-positive 0401 Tg (black bars) or SE-
negative 0402 Tg (white bars) mice were cultured for 6 d in OC-differenti-
ating medium with or without 3 nM TCDD or 100 nM FICZ in the presence or
absence of various concentrations of the NF-κB pathway inhibitor, Wed. OCs
were counted as above. Data (mean and SEM) represent biologic replicates
(n = 3). Asterisks denote significance within the respective Tg mouse lines
(*P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001); # symbols denote statistical significance
between 0401 Tg versus 0402 Tg mice (#P < 0.05; ##P < 0.01; ###P < 0.001).

Interaction between the SE and AhR pathways in vivo. CIA was induced
in B10.M Tg mice carrying either a DRB1*04:01−/+ (SE+), or DRB1*04:01−/− (SE−)
genotype. Mice were injected i.p. weekly with FICZ, 28 ng/gm body weight, or
TCDD, 0.3 ng/gm body weight, or DMSO. In A, P values were calculated using a
two-tailed t test. In B, P values were calculated using a log-ranked (Mantel–Cox)
test. In C, P values were calculated using a paired t test for the entire disease
course. Results are compiled data from two experiments (n = 16 per group in
FICZ treatment experiments, and n = 18 per group in TCDD treatment experi-
ments). In all figures, error bars represent SEM.

 inhibiting osteoblasts (47), thereby facilitating inflammation and
bone destruction in RA (52). Our previous studies (8–23) have
demonstrated that the SE ligand activates similar cellular and
pathologic effects, suggesting that the two pathways operate in a
similar fashion. It is therefore intriguing that the NF-κB pathway,
an important activator of several pathogenic mechanisms in RA
(42, 43, 53), and a downstream effector mechanism of AhR-
activated RA-relevant effects (24, 54), was identified here as
the pathway that mediates SE–AhR interaction. Thus, the data
presented here provide a molecular basis for cross-talk between
the two pathways. Based on these findings, we propose a mecha-
nistic model of gene–environment interaction in inflammatory
arthritis (Fig. S8).
Methods
Reagents, Cells, and Mice. Reagents, cells, and mice in this study were as
previously described (8, 20, 34–36). For details see SI Materials and Methods.
Mice were housed at the University of Michigan’s Unit for Laboratory
Animal Medicine facility. All experiments were performed in accordance
with protocols approved by the Committee on Use and Care of Animals.
Quantification of OC Differentiation in Vitro. The quantification of OC dif-
ferentiatin in vitro was performed as previously described (8, 17, 20). For
details see SI Materials and Methods.
T-Cell Differentiation Assays and Flow Cytometry. T-cell differentiation assays
and flow cytometry were performed as we previously described (12). For
details see SI Materials and Methods.
Western Blots. NF-κB p65 nuclear translocation was determined in 70% con-
fluent RAW 264.7 cells pretreated for 1 h with or without the NF-κB inhibitor
wedelolactone (7-methoxy-5, 11, 12-trihydroxycoumestan; Sigma-Aldrich) be-
fore stimulating them with various agents in DMSO, or the vehicle alone. After
treatment, cells were rinsed twice with ice-cold PBS, harvested, and resus-
pended in 200 μL of buffer A (10 mM Hepes, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM KCl and
0.1% Nonidet P-40) containing 1× protease/phosphatase inhibitor mixture
(Cell Signaling Technology). After spin down for 30 s at 14,000 rpm, the cy-
tosolic portion of the protein was transferred to a new tube. Cell pellets were
resuspended in 50 μL of buffer B (20 mM Hepes, 0.42 M NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2,
0.2 mM EDTA and 25% V/V glycerol) containing 1× protease/phosphatase in-
hibitor mixture (Cell Signaling Technology). After incubation on ice for 30 min
with constant vortex, the samples were spun down at 14,000 rpm for 15 min in
4 °C, and nuclear proteins were then transferred to a new tube. Proteins were
quantified using a BCA Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Equal quantities of nu-
clear or cytosolic protein were separated by 10% Tris-glycine SDS/PAGE gels
(Life Technologies) and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF)
membrane. After blocking with 5% nonfat milk in Tris-phosphate buffer
containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T) for 1 h, the membranes were further in-
cubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies including anti–NF-κB p65, or
antiphospho–NF-κB (Ser536) (both from Cell Signaling Technology). As a
loading control, the blots were also probed for β-actin (Thermo Fisher Scien-
tific). The next day, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies
(GE Healthcare Life Sciences) were applied. Peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin
and substrate were used for detection. The blot images were captured using a
quantitative Western imaging system (Aplegen’s Omega Lum C).
CIA Induction and in Vivo AhR Agonist Administration. To induce autoimmune
arthritis in the HLA-DR mouse strains (B10.M background), 8- to 10-wk-old mice
were immunized s.c. at the base of the tail with 100 μg of bovine CII emulsified
in complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA) containing 4 mg/mL of heat-killed
Mycobacterium (H37Ra, Difco). Starting at day 18 postimmunization, mice
were examined three times per week and the presence of arthritic limbs,
the number of affected limbs, and the severity of the arthritis were assessed.
Severity of disease was evaluated by visual inspection and each limb was
assigned a score using a scale of 0–4 as described (55). TCDD (0.3 ng/gm body
weight) or FICZ (28 ng/gm body weight) were administered in 50 μL of DMSO
once per week i.p. Control mice received equal volume of the DMSO vehicle
only. Arthritis severity was determined as previously described (20).
Joint Tissue Studies. Joint tissue studies were performed as previously de-
scribed (20, 23). For details see SI Materials and Methods.
Radiological Imaging. Radiological imaging was performed as previously
described (20, 23). For details see SI Materials and Methods.
Statistical Analysis. Student’s t test, log-ranked (Mantel–Cox) test, or two-
way ANOVA test using Prism 6.0 (GraphPad) software was used. In Fig. 1 C–F,
statistical analyses of synergism were performed using a two-way ANOVA by

IMMUNOLOGY AND
INFLAMMATION
 SAS software (version 9.4). A fixed-effect, general linear model was created
in SAS for the interactions of the independent variables of AhR agonist (FICZ
or TCDD) concentrations and either SE genotype or soluble SE-ligand con-
centration and for their effect on the number of TRAP+ cells. An F test was
conducted for each model to determine the presence of a statistically sig-
nificant synergistic effect as indicated by the probability of observing an F
value greater than or equal to the f statistic of the interaction term under
the null hypothesis of an F(DFinteraction, DF error) distribution. Under the
null hypothesis, there is no interaction between the independent variables.
An f statistic is defined as f = Mean Squares interaction
Mean Squares error . The mean squares error is
the variance of data not explained by the model and is defined as
MSerror = Sum of Squares error
DF error
. An α = 0.05 was selected for statistical significance.
P values <0.05 were considered significant; P values >0.05 were considered
nonsignificant (NS). All flow cytometry data were analyzed with FlowJo
(TreeStar). No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size.
