Abstract
Objectives: To investigate the efficacy of shoe orthotics with and without chiropractic treatment for chronic low back pain compared with no
treatment.
Design: Randomized controlled trial.
Setting: Integrative medicine teaching clinic at a university.
Participants: Adult subjects (NZ225) with symptomatic low back pain of �3 months were recruited from a volunteer sample.
Interventions: Subjects were randomized into 1 of 3 treatment groups (shoe orthotic, plus, and waitlist groups). The shoe orthotic group received
custom-made shoe orthotics. The plus group received custom-made orthotics plus chiropractic manipulation, hot or cold packs, and manual soft
tissue massage. The waitlist group received no care.
Main Outcome Measures: The primary outcome measures were change in perceived back pain (numerical pain rating scale) and functional health
status (Oswestry Disability Index) after 6 weeks of study participation. Outcomes were also assessed after 12 weeks and then after an additional 3,
6, and 12 months.
Results: After 6 weeks, all 3 groups demonstrated significant within-group improvement in average back pain, but only the shoe orthotic and plus
groups had significant within-group improvement in function. When compared with the waitlist group, the shoe orthotic group demonstrated
significantly greater improvements in pain (P<.0001) and function (PZ.0068). The addition of chiropractic to orthotics treatment demonstrated
significantly greater improvements in function (PZ.0278) when compared with orthotics alone, but no significant difference in pain (PZ.3431).
Group differences at 12 weeks and later were not significant.
Conclusions: Six weeks of prescription shoe orthotics significantly improved back pain and dysfunction compared with no treatment. The
addition of chiropractic care led to higher improvements in function.

Low back pain (LBP) is a steadily increasing global epidemic.
Approximately 25% of the U.S. adult population experiences LBP
during a 3-month time period, and nearly double experience back
pain over the course of a year.1 Johannes et al2 estimated the point
prevalence of chronic low back pain (CLBP) to be nearly 31%
(95% confidence interval, 29.8e31.7).
Podiatrists have connected the use of foot orthoses for the
relief of LBP with the thought that back pain may be related to a
disruption in the kinetic chain.3-5 However, it was not until the last
decade that other investigators have begun to study the effect of
foot function on the kinematics of the knee, hip, pelvis, and tho-
rax.6-10 Rothbart et al11 argues that forefoot varum (forcing the
foot into hyperpronation) is a leading cause of pelvic repositioning
and mechanical LBP. Khamis and Yizhar,7 and Pinto et al,8 found
that induced hyperpronation of the foot (measured via calcaneal
eversion) in healthy subjects had a significant effect on pelvic

 alignment. Although these studies are all pilot projects containing

all

significantly
conclude
that
foot
dysfunction should not be overlooked as a potential contributing
factor in treating individuals with LBP and dysfunction.
Integrative care is also seen as an alternative for back pain. Lind
et al12 found that individuals with LBP used conventional therapy
(45%), complementary and alternative medicine (43%), or both
(12%) for their pain. Chiropractic care was the most common form
of integrative care used (33%).12 Interestingly, 72.1% of chiro-
practors combine spinal manipulation with custom-made shoe or-
thotics for the treatment of pain.13 Several recent literature reviews
indicate that there are no high-quality clinical trials evaluating the
effectiveness of shoe orthotics for the treatment of LBP.14,15
Therefore, the purpose of this randomized controlled trial was
to determine the change in perceived pain levels and functional
health status in patients with CLBP at the end of 6 weeks of shoe
orthotic treatment alone or orthotics plus chiropractic treatment
(plus group) as compared with no treatment (waitlist group). We
hypothesized that shoe orthotics alone would be significantly
better than no treatment for LBP and disability, and that shoe
orthotics plus chiropractic treatment would be significantly better
than shoe orthotics alone.
Methods
In this randomized controlled trial, 225 subjects with CLBP were
randomized to 1 of 3 groups: Foot Levelers shoe orthotic, plus, or
waitlist. Pain and disability were measured at baseline and at the
end of 6 weeks of care or no care. An institutional review board
approved the trial, and the trial was registered on clinicaltrials.gov.
All
patients
provided
written
informed
consent
prior
to
study entry.
Participants
Individuals with CLBP were recruited through media advertising
in a Midwestern suburban region of the United States beginning
Spring 2014 through early Fall 2015 (JA Cambron, JM Dex-
heimer, LN Zoufal, unpublished data, 2017). Subjects were tele-
phone screened for basic inclusion/exclusion criteria (appendix 1).
Clinic visits
Subjects who were eligible at the telephone screen were invited to
attend a baseline examination visit. On arrival at the baseline
examination
visit,
subjects
were
asked
to
complete
self-
administered questionnaires, provide informed consent, and un-
dergo medical history and low back examination by a licensed
chiropractic clinician or trained intern to verify the physical in-
clusion and exclusion criteria (see appendix 1).
All eligible and interested subjects then underwent an orthotic
assessment including a standing static evaluation of posture (Foot
Posture Index)16 and foot pressure mapping (3D BodyView Im-
aging Unita). Images of the bottom of the foot were quantified
based on a color replacement algorithm,a which was used to
calculate the Staheli index, Chippaux-Smirak index, arch angle,
and arch index.
Once the orthotics returned from production, the subject was
scheduled for the randomization visit. During the randomization
visit, the patient was randomized and the clinician/intern dis-
cussed procedures for proper use of orthotics with those in the
Foot Levelers shoe orthotic or plus groups and reminded those in
the waitlist group that she/he would receive orthotics at the week 6
visit. Those randomized to the Plus Group immediately began
chiropractic treatment.
Subjects were asked to return for a week 12 follow-up visit to
check-in with the physician and complete questionnaires.
Randomization process
Prior to study initiation, a randomization scheme was created by a
research fellow not associated with this trial. Randomization was
based on a random numbers table with each random allocation
being placed in consecutively numbered, sealed manila envelopes.
Interventions
Foot Levelers shoe orthotic group
Seventy-five of the 225 participating subjects were randomized into
the Foot Levelers shoe orthotic group and received 2 pairs of
custom-made leather shoe orthotics containing supports for the
medial longitudinal, lateral longitudinal, and anterior transverse
arches (Moderate Luxury Full Length and the Tight Fitting Luxury
3/4 Length dress modelsa). The materials used in construction of the
orthotics were specific to the gait cycle and included a shock
absorbing polymer placed in the heel to assist during heel strike
(Zorbacela), a stiffer polymer for support in mid-stance (Stance-
Guardb), and a springy polymer in the forefoot of the orthotic to
assist in toe-off (Propacela). The size and shape of the orthotic
supports were made based on the height and weight of the patient
related to the foot scan and measurements taken. Additional mod-
ifications to orthotics were made on a case-by-case basis, dependent
on patient presentation and/or comfort level postebreak-in period.
Some evidence exists suggesting a 1- to 2-week break-in or
acclimation period with orthotic use for foot and ankle dysfunc-
tion17,18; however, little is known about acclimation for patients
with LBP. Instructions regarding the break-in period (approxi-
mately 2e3wk) were provided, including informing the subjects
to gradually increase the amount of time the orthotics were worn
and disclosing there may be a slight increase or change in
symptoms while the body acclimates to the orthotics.
Plus group
Seventy-five of the 225 participating subjects were randomized
into the plus group. These subjects also received 2 pairs of
custom-made shoe orthotics, in addition to 6 weeks of chiropractic
treatment for 1 to 4 visits per week. The chiropractic care could
include treatment of the cervical, thoracic, and/or lumbar spine,
and the lower extremities for the LBP complaint. Specific thera-
pies allowed in this study included hot/cold packs, brief manual
massage, or chiropractic manipulations, including high-velocity,
low-amplitude manipulation and/or flexion-distraction therapy.
These chiropractic techniques along with the ancillary care
have been widely used in practice and in clinical studies. Many
studies have investigated the use of high-velocity, low-amplitude

 manipulation19-26 and flexion-distraction therapy27-40 for the
treatment of CLBP,19-26 which are among the most common types
of chiropractic manipulations used in practice13 and are consid-
ered to be established treatments based on practice guidelines.41
The decisions regarding the type(s) of care to use were made by
7 different licensed chiropractic physicians with at least 3 years of
clinical experience, and all manipulations were administered by
those physicians, whereas initial intake and ancillary care could
have been provided by an intern.
In practice, the amount of care a patient receives may vary
based on pain severity and chronicity. According to research, most
chiropractic cases resolve within 6 weeks of intervention41 and
include 2 to 3 weekly visits42 for a total of 5 to 18 visits.19-40,43 In
1 study on high-velocity, low-amplitude manipulation for LBP,
clinical and statistical improvements for CLBP were more likely
with 3 to 4 chiropractic treatments per week rather than 1 to 2
times.25 Therefore, in this study, plus group subjects were asked to
complete 1 to 4 visits per week for each of the 6 weeks of
chiropractic care for a range of 6 to 24 visits total.
Waitlist group
The remaining study participants were randomized to a 6-week
wait period, after which they were also given the same 2 pairs of
Foot Levelers custom-made shoe orthotics. Subjects were not
excluded from the study for treatment outside of the study pa-
rameters, but such treatment was discouraged and documented.
Patient safety
Patients completed biweekly questionnaires to assess pain level,
disability, and the use, comfort, and effects of the shoe orthotics. If
the patient mentioned any side-effects from care, the clinician was
notified and the patient was reexamined if necessary. No patient in
the study experienced any adverse event.
Outcome measures
All assessments were collected either in the traditional paper
format or online through SurveyMonkey,c a secure online web-
based service. The primary outcome measures in this study were
the average LBP level measured by the numerical pain rating scale
and low back disability measured by the Oswestry Disability
Index (ODI) at baseline, 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and after an addi-
tional 3, 6, and 12 months.
The numerical pain rating scale includes numbers from 0 to 10,
wherein the patient selects the number that best describes the LBP
during a specified time period. Four separate scales were
measured: LBP level now, typical or average pain level in the last
2 weeks, pain level at its best in the last 2 weeks, and pain level at
its worst in the last 2 weeks.
The numerical pain rating scale is one of the most frequently
used methods for the measurement of clinical pain. Although the
numerical pain rating scale has been previously assessed for validity
and reliability, only 1 study has attempted to characterize its
responsiveness in patients with LBP.44 Although previous pain
research has shown the use of a composite mean of the now, average,
and worst scores,45 newer research indicates that composite mea-
sures of pain are not statistically better than individual pain ratings,
specifically for studies assessing change in pain with group com-
parisons and large samples.46 Therefore, the typical or average pain
over the last 2 weeks was used as our primary outcome measure.
One of most commonly used measurements in the literature for
low back disability, particularly in studies involving orthotics, is
the ODI,47-52 a condition-specific questionnaire covering 10 areas
of daily living. The measured areas include pain intensity, per-
sonal care, lifting, walking, sitting, standing, sleeping, sex life,
social life, and traveling. Each category is scored on a continuum
from 0 to 5 points, for a possible total score of 50, described as
100% disability. Validity measures of the ODI have demonstrated
Pearson correlation coefficients between .76 and .99,48,53,54 and
reliability measures have demonstrated an intraclass correlation
coefficient of .83 for test-retest reliability.54
To better assess treatment effect and adherence to care, con-
sistency/frequency of orthotic use (number of days and number of
hours worn), symptoms experienced during use, comfort levels, and
other health care utilization for LBP were collected every 2 weeks
of participation via self-report survey by the participant. Adherence
to care was defined as at least 1 chiropractic treatment per week for
6 weeks (plus group) and at least 8 days of orthotic wear time every
2 weeks postebreak-in period (Foot Levelers shoe orthotic group
and plus group). No participant was excluded for noncompliance.
Data collection through 6 weeks was completed for all par-
ticipants by mid-October 2015.
As secondary outcome measures, the numerical pain rating
scale for average LBP and ODI measures were also collected at a
week 12 follow-up visit and again via mail or online 3, 6, and 12
months after the date of that final visit.
Blinding
Because of the nature of the study, neither subjects nor research
personnel were blind to the treatment group allocations.
Statistical analysis
The sample size for this study was calculated for a 2-sided in-
dependent samples t test with type I error rate of aZ.05. Samples
of 64 per group would provide 80% power to detect a medium
effect size. Effect size is calculated as the difference in the means
divided by the SD of the difference, where 0.5 is considered a
medium effect and 0.8 is considered a large effect. The previous
pilot study demonstrated a large effect size.50 Calculating for a
medium effect size is more conservative, but increases the like-
lihood of detecting meaningful differences in the study. Correcting
for a potential of <20% withdrawal rate, the sample size of 75
subjects per group was set.
Minimal clinically important difference (MCID) scores of at
least 30% change from baseline were statistically assessed55 by
group through secondary chi-square analyses (dfZ2).
Patients were analyzed according to their randomly assigned
treatment (intention-to-treat analysis), regardless of whether or not
they received the full treatment or were lost to follow-up.
Baseline characteristics were summarized with basic descriptive
statistics and stratified by treatment group. Tables and analyses
include imputed week 6 data (taken from week 4 when no week 6
survey was completed); therefore, sample sizes may be different
then numbers reported in figure 1. Baseline differences by treatment
were tested using 1-way analysis of variance or chi-square tests
(table 1). Each within-group mean change score was tested at each
follow-up point against zero using paired t tests, a 95% confidence
interval was calculated for each mean change score, and means
were compared across the 3 groups at each time point using 1-way
analysis of variance (tables 2 and 3). Multiple linear regression was
1754
J.A. Cambron et al

 used to test for treatment effects on change scores at each time
point, adjusting for baseline outcome values (table 4).
Results
A total of 682 people underwent the telephone screen, and 416
were eligible. Of those, 290 presented for the baseline visit, and
225 subjects were randomized (see fig 1). There was no evidence
of significant differences across treatments for any baseline
characteristics (see table 1).
The most common types of chiropractic therapies administered
to plus group participants included brief manual massage (77.6%);
thoracic and sacroiliac high-velocity, low-amplitude manipulation
(45.8% and 58.3% respectively); and flexion-distraction mobili-
zation (54.6%) (table 5). Most study participants were compliant

 with treatment. In the plus group, 86.7% of participants were
compliant with chiropractic care and 96.8% were compliant with
orthotic use. In the Foot Levelers shoe orthotic group, 92.5% were
compliant with orthotic use. By the end of week 6, the plus and
Foot Levelers shoe orthotic group participants wore the orthotics
an average of 11.9 and 12.9 days, respectively, over a 2-week
period. Number of hours worn daily may have impacted the
overall study result, but seemingly increased after the break-in
period (table 6).
After 6 weeks, average LBP decreased significantly in all 3
groups (see table 2 and fig 2), demonstrating <1-point improve-
ment in the waitlist group, but 1.9- and 2.3-point improvements in
the Foot Levelers shoe orthotic and plus groups, respectively.
Decreases in pain from baseline remain significant in all 3 groups
for all time points up to 12 months. The between-group assess-
ment of average pain demonstrated no significant differences at
baseline, but a significant difference in week 6 average pain scores
(P<.0001) and in change scores between groups (P<.0001). The
within-group change scores from baseline to every follow-up
through 12 months were statistically significant. However, there
were no significant between-group differences at week 12 or later.
Within-group disability scores were significantly improved in
the Foot Levelers shoe orthotic and plus groups after 6 weeks of
care, with an average of 2.3- and 4.3-point improvements in the 2
groups, respectively (see table 3 and fig 3). However, the within-
group scores were not significantly different pre-post waitlist
group. The mean ODI scores did not differ across the 3 treatments at
baseline (PZ.7039), but at week 6 the mean scores varied across
treatments (PZ.0146), and there was strong evidence that the mean
change scores varied with treatment (P<.0001). Improvements
across time remained significant up to 12 months in all 3 groups.
There is some evidence of a difference in mean change between
treatments at 3 months after the 12-week point (PZ.0231), with
less improvement in the waitlist group. Mean change is not different
between groups at 12 weeks, or at 6 or 12 months later.
Adjusted for baseline values (see table 4), there was a signif-
icantly higher improvement in the Foot Levelers shoe orthotic
group compared with the waitlist group for both outcomes
(P<.0001 for average pain, PZ.0068 for the ODI). The addition
of chiropractic care to the orthotic treatment demonstrated better
outcomes than orthotic care alone, with the contrast being statis-
tically significant for the ODI (PZ.0278) but not for average pain
(PZ.3431). Changes were not significantly different between
groups at later time points for either outcome.
The MCID (proportions of patients with �30% improvement
in pain or disability) is summarized and compared across treat-
ment groups in tables 7 and 8. The 3 groups are significantly
different at 6 weeks (P<.0001 for both pain and disability).
Similar to results for continuous change scores, the best results
were in the plus group, in which 70% had a decrease in pain and
56% a decrease in disability of �30% compared with baseline,
followed by 58% and 38% in the Foot Levelers shoe orthotic
group and only 22% and 20% in the waitlist group, respectively.
When comparing only the Foot Levelers shoe orthotic group and
the waitlist group at 6 weeks, the Foot Levelers shoe orthotic
group is significantly better than the waitlist group (PZ.0174 for

Orthotics and low back pain

 pain and P<.0001 for disability). Compared with the Foot Lev-
elers shoe orthotic group, the addition of chiropractic care in the
plus group demonstrates a significant improvement in pain
(PZ.0312) but not disability (PZ.1383).
Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale clinical trial
assessing orthotics for treatment of LBP. As hypothesized, LBP
and dysfunction were significantly improved with custom-made
shoe orthotics compared with a waitlist group, and disability was
more significantly improved with the addition of chiropractic care.
However, scores were not significantly different between the Foot
Levelers shoe orthotic group and plus group. This lack of differ-
ence is difficult to understand; however, a floor effect may have
come into play with the pain measures. Future research may want
to focus on the difference in pain scores for patients with higher
baseline levels of pain.
The MCID data in this study mirrored the change score data
in that there were significant group differences for pain and
disability at week 6. The effect of care was no longer signifi-
cantly different between groups after this time point; however,
after week 6, all treatment groups were provided with orthotics
so it is not surprising that differences in group effects were
negligible. It is noteworthy that for most time points after week
6, the MCID data remained relatively stable, with no large
decreases in the proportion of subjects who had at least 30%
improvement in pain or disability compared with baseline,
potentially demonstrating a lasting effect of care with the
orthotic treatment.
There are several small-scale or lower-quality studies investi-
gating the use of shoe orthotics for the treatment of LBP
demonstrating mixed results.11,50-52,56-60 Likewise, the studies that
included chiropractic care along with shoe orthotics demonstrated

 trends toward improvement of LBP and/or lower extremity
symptoms61-64; however, there was some variability in outcomes.
One small-scale study assessed an orthotics group, orthotics
plus chiropractic group, and a no treatment group. This study
demonstrated that chiropractic plus shoe orthotics improved foot
and ankle symptoms, activities of daily living, sport and recrea-
tion, and quality of life in workers with LBP whose job required
them to stand at least 6 hours daily63; however, there was no
significant benefit in reducing pain levels in any of the groups
compared with baseline. Inconsistency of orthotic use was
described as potentially confounding the study results. Our study
did measure frequency of use of the orthotic and found that
participants were compliant with orthotic wear throughout the
study, which most likely improved the reliability of our results.
We also calculated between-group differences to determine
group effects.
A similar small-scale study compared chiropractic plus
orthotics versus chiropractic plus sham orthotics.64 The results
demonstrated that both groups improved, but there were no
significant differences between the groups in terms of pain or
disability, indicating that the orthotics did not add to the treatment
benefit. The authors in this study commented that future trials
should include subjects who wear orthotics in a weight-bearing
capacity each day because lack of such wear may have affected
their outcomes. Our study included subjects who were manual and
nonmanual laborers, but we did not measure the amount of
standing on a daily basis to compare findings.
A previous feasibility study by this research group50 demon-
strated changes in CLBP and disability with the use of shoe or-
thotics for 6 weeks compared with a waitlist control group. This
prior study demonstrated results similar to the current large-
scale study.
Of note is that none of the 3 previous studies50,63,64 assessed
MCID scores in their analyses; therefore, the results cannot be
fully compared with our current findings regarding MCID.
Study limitations
There were possible study limitations present in this clinical trial.
First, our subjects were diagnosed with several low back condi-
tions, and some diagnoses may respond better to shoe orthotics
and/or chiropractic care than others. Subjects and clinicians were
aware of the group assignment, possibly affecting the care
rendered and the self-report outcomes of pain and disability.
Finally, the natural history of LBP and other psychological and/or

 physiological events may have led to changes in pain over time,
for which we had no control.
Conclusions
This large-scale clinical trial demonstrated that LBP and disability
were significantly improved after 6 weeks of Foot Levelers shoe
orthotics care compared with a waitlist group, and that the addi-
tion of chiropractic care with the orthotics demonstrated a sig-
nificant improvement in the disability scores compared with
orthotics alone. The within-group change scores from baseline to
every follow-up through 12 months were statistically significant.
However, there were no significant between-group differences at
week 12 or later.
