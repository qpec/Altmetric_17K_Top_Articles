Objective: To evaluate the impact of a population-based telephonic wellness coaching program on
weight loss.
Methods: Individual-level segmented regression analysis of interrupted time series data comparing the
BMI trajectories in the 12 months before versus the 12 months after initiating coaching among a cohort
of Kaiser Permanente Northern California members (n 5 954) participating in The Permanente Medical
Group Wellness Coaching program in 2011. The control group was a 20:1 propensity-score matched
control group (n 5 19,080) matched with coaching participants based on baseline demographic and clini-
cal characteristics.
Results: Wellness coaching participants had a significant upward trend in BMI in the 12 months before
their first wellness coaching session and a significant downward trend in BMI in the 12 months after their
first session equivalent to a clinically significant reduction of greater than one unit of baseline BMI
(P < 0.01 for both). The control group did not have statistically significant decreases in BMI during the
post-period.
Conclusions: Wellness coaching has a positive impact on BMI reduction that is both statistically and
clinically significant. Future research and quality improvement efforts should focus on disseminating well-
ness coaching for weight loss in patients with diabetes and those at risk for developing the disease.

Introduction
Recent national estimates suggest that more than two thirds (68.8%)
of adult Americans are above normal weight: more than one third of
the population consists of people with obesity, and more than 1 in
20 have a body mass index (BMI) �40 kg/m2 (1,2). This may
increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, heart disease, high
blood pressure, stroke, and some types of cancer within individuals
(3,4). Among patients with diabetes, populations with overweight or
obesity may also have higher rates of diabetes complications (5-7).
Although obesity is an epidemic in the U.S., there are very few
health plan-based programs designed to promote weight loss at the
population level. Telephone-based, or telephonic, wellness coaching
programs may help to address excess weight gain by encouraging
healthy lifestyle choices (8). Telephonic wellness coaching is often
delivered by nonphysician health care providers such as nurses and
gives patients the support, information, and skills to improve their
self-efficacy and make patient-directed positive changes in health
behaviors (9-13). Randomized controlled trials testing the efficacy
of coaching have suggested that patients who participate in tele-
phonic coaching may achieve small but significant weight loss
(8,14-16), and other studies have suggested that health coaching can
improve outcomes for patients with chronic diseases (12,17) and
reduce medical cost and hospitalization (18). Despite its potential
positive impact on weight loss, telephonic wellness coaching has not
been widely adopted as an obesity intervention, and there is very lit-
tle evidence on how to integrate meaningful weight loss into routine

 clinical practice (19-21) where it may be most effective (22). While
some community-based coaching programs conducted by research
teams have been evaluated (14,23,24), there are no evaluations of
the effectiveness of real-world wellness coaching programs on
weight loss when implemented across a health care delivery system.
The purpose of this study is to conduct an evaluation of The Perma-
nente Medical Group (TPMG) telephonic wellness coaching program
on 12-month weight loss among patients who initiated the program
to address weight, exercise, and healthy eating concerns.
Methods
Study setting and coaching program description
Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) is an integrated
health care delivery system currently serving approximately 3.8 mil-
lion members in Northern California. KPNC membership is diverse,
community-based, and broadly representative of the local and state-
wide population. TPMG is a multidisciplinary medical group that
provides programs and direct care to KPNC members. Since 2010,
TPMG has provided a telephonic wellness coaching program which
supports patients’ efforts to change behaviors related to weight man-
agement, healthy eating, physical activity, tobacco cessation, and
stress reduction. The wellness coaching program has been described
in detail elsewhere (9,10,25,26). In brief, during the first coaching
session (approximately 20–30 minutes in length), patients speak to
their wellness coach on the telephone, decide on a health topic on
which to focus, assess readiness to change, and choose an action
step to begin; follow-up sessions are typically 10–15 minutes in
length scheduled on an ad hoc basis upon request and are intended
to be completed within a year or less. Wellness coaches are TPMG
master’s-level clinical health educators who are trained in motiva-
tional interviewing strategies, a patient-centered counseling style
that engages intrinsic motivation within the patient to change behav-
ior (27). Members are connected to participate in the wellness
coaching program through referrals by TPMG providers and staff
and partnerships with employers; patients may also self-refer if they
learned about the coaching program through any of these methods,
from fellow patients, or from their medical facility. Wellness coach-
ing is a covered benefit and is offered as a covered benefit to all
KPNC members.
Study participants
We examined all adults who initiated telephonic coaching between
January 1 and August 23, 2011 (n 5 1,539), and selected those who
contacted coaching regarding a topic directly related to BMI (i.e.,
weight management, healthy eating, and physical activity) (n 5
1,183). We limited our analyses to those who had non-missing data
for the propensity-score matching variables described below (n 5
1,173), those with no pregnancy recorded during their observation
window (n 5 1,139), and those who had a valid BMI observation in
the year leading up to and the year after the initiating coaching ses-
sion (n 5 954). The index date for the coaching participants was the
date of their first coaching session.
We used propensity-score matching to select a control group not
exposed to wellness coaching from the population of KPNC mem-
bers who were in the age range of the coaching participants (18–90
years), whose primary language was recorded as English or Spanish,
and who had non-missing data for the variables used in the propen-
sity score described below. Propensity for participating in wellness
coaching was calculated from a logistic regression model with the
following variables: age, gender, race/ethnicity, annual number of
primary care visits in previous year, home service area, current
tobacco use, health risk and comorbidities as measured by the Diag-
nostic Cost Group score (28,29), and the patient’s 12-month BMI
trajectory as the patient’s average BMI in each of the four quarters
in the year before the index date (four BMI observations total). For
quarters without a BMI observation, we used the last observation
carried forward or next observation carried backward; this propor-
tion of 20% did not differ between the participant and control
groups (data not shown). As the index dates of the coaching partici-
pants spanned three quarters of 2011 and the propensity score model
included time-varying measures (e.g., most recent BMI in each of
the four quarters, number of primary care visits in the previous
year), we generated propensity scores for the eligible controls for
each quarter of the study using data relative to the first day of the
quarter. Using propensity-score matching with the nearest neighbor
without replacement method, for each coaching participant we iden-
tified 20 matched controls who were not exposed to wellness coach-
ing; this number was chosen to maximize the availability of poten-
tial controls while also maximizing efficiency (30). The index date
for the participants was set at the date they started the program and
for matched controls was defined as the first day of the quarter for
which they were matched.
Main outcome measure and data sources
All data for this study were derived from the KPNC electronic
health record (EHR) and administrative databases. Weight, height,
and BMI (kg/m2) are measured, recorded, and calculated at each
office visit, and this information is placed in the EHR. If a patient
had more than one BMI recorded on the same day, the mean BMI
was used for that day. All observed BMI values in the year before
and year after the index date were used to model BMI trajectories.
Statistical methods
We modeled BMI trends for the coaching participants and the
matched controls using segmented linear regression analysis of inter-
rupted times series data, a variation of standard linear regression
analysis that estimates the slope in the year before the index date
separately from the slope in the year after (31-34). The model
included a linear time trend and a term to estimate the slope change
at the index date. To test for differences between the coaching par-
ticipants and the matched controls, the model further included an
indicator for group, the interaction between the group indicator and
the time trend, and the interaction between the group indicator and
the term to estimate the slope change at the index date. The model
used individual-level data and adjusted for the correlation among
BMI measurement within patients. As a sensitivity analysis, we cal-
culated the BMI unit change and weight change for each individual
and compared this average between the two groups.
Pearson v2 tests of independence and two-sample t-tests were used
to compare the baseline characteristics of the coaching participants
and the control group. All analyses were conducted using SASV
R ver-
sion 9.3 (35). These analyses were conducted under the auspices of
the “Natural Experiments for Translation in Diabetes Study”; the
KPNC Institutional Review Board approved this study.

 Results
A total of 954 coaching participants met the inclusion criteria for
this study. Coaching participants were majority white (52%) and
predominately female (83%). The mean age for coaching partici-
pants was 52 years old, and the mean BMI was 34.5 kg/m2. There
were no significant differences between coaching participants and
the matched control group on age, gender, race/ethnicity, primary
language, baseline BMI, pre-index date BMI slope, current tobacco
use, percentage with a diabetes diagnosis at baseline, and Diagnostic
Cost Group risk score; there was a small but statistically significant
difference in the mean number of primary care visits (4.3. vs. 4.0,
P 5 0.03). The mean number of telephonic coaching visits for pro-
gram participants was 1.8 (Table 1).
Table 2 and Figure 1 show the results of segmented linear regression
analysis of interrupted time series data. The trajectory of patient
BMI, or the slope, before the start of coaching was significantly pos-
itive for both participants exposed to wellness coaching and their
matched controls who were not exposed to coaching, indicating both
groups were gaining weight before the index date. There was no sig-
nificant difference in this positive slope prior to the index date

 between the two groups (P 5 0.09). The BMI trajectory after the
start of wellness coaching was negative for coaching program partic-
ipants (21.79 kg/m2, P < 0.001), indicating a significant change in
BMI that translates to weight loss 12 months after coaching initia-
tion. The matched controls did not have a decrease in BMI (slope
20.26, P 5 0.11), and the difference in the post-index date slopes
for the two groups was statistically significant (P 5 0.002).
Our sensitivity analysis showed that the BMI unit change and the
weight change for each individual averaged across groups were stat-
istically significantly lower in coaching participants compared with
controls (data not shown).
Discussion
Obesity is a major health issue in the U.S., increasing the risks
of developing diabetes and the risks of micro- and macrovascular
complications in diabetes patients. Behavioral interventions within
clinical
settings
may be
an
important
means for
addressing
unhealthy behaviors (36). This study was designed to evaluate the
impact of a real-world telephonic wellness coaching program on
weight loss among patients whose goals were to manage their
weight, improve their healthy eating habits, or increase their
physical
activity.
Among
wellness
coaching
participants,
we
found a significant downward trajectory in BMI over a 12-month
period starting from the first coaching session, compared with
matched controls who were not exposed to coaching, and an esti-
mated level of BMI reduction of greater than one unit, which is
considered clinically significant in populations with overweight
and obesity (37). These results are comparable to those of clinical
trials of coaching interventions (19,20), suggesting that telephonic
coaching programs can be effective when adopted as part of
routine clinical care. Telephonic wellness coaching that is imple-
mented as a part of routine health care and made accessible to
health plan populations may provide effective weight loss support
at the population level.
The wellness coaching model delivered by TPMG is based on motiva-
tional interviewing, which is a patient-centered and evidence-based
approach to behavior change (10,38). While the coaching program does
not require use of a standardized guidebook or educational content for
the coaching sessions, patients are provided with the opportunity to
receive evidence-based Kaiser Permanente-branded health education
materials relevant to their coaching topics of interest. This study adds to
the evidence that motivational interviewing combined with evidence-
based health education information is an effective approach to weight
loss by demonstrating the positive impact of the coaching program on
weight loss. Studies have shown that motivational interviewing is more
effective than other more directive or educational-based interventions
(39). This coaching program resulted in an average of approximately
two encounters per participant; prior research suggests that low-
intensity interventions based on motivational interviewing such as this
one can be effective across a range of health behavior outcomes (40).
Our results suggest that using a motivational interviewing-based
approach in population-based preventive and care programs can be an
important strategy for helping patients achieve a healthy weight and
potentially improving health care outcomes.
This study has several limitations. Individuals were not randomized
to participate in coaching, and the participation rate in the program
was relatively low compared with the size of the general KPNC
membership; there may be differences in motivation between
patients who selected wellness coaching versus the matched control
group in these analyses which could not be balanced out through
propensity-score matching. Socioeconomic status, which may also
differ between coaching participants versus controls, was also not

 available for use in the propensity score models. However, our pro-
pensity scores used a wide range of variables available in the EHRs.
While this program was made available to all KPNC members, a
relatively small percentage of KPNC members took advantage of
the program in its early years. Future research should continue to
explore the most effective means for encouraging participation in
telephonic wellness coaching among patients seeking to lose weight
to improve their health and well-being (23).
Conclusion
Telephonic wellness coaching programs implemented within health
care delivery systems may help to provide effective weight loss sup-
port to the broader population and reduce the rates of chronic dis-
ease and health complications related to excess weight gain. Future
research should assess the effectiveness of other real-world weight
loss programs and examine how to disseminate and spread effective
weight loss programs on a wide scale.O
