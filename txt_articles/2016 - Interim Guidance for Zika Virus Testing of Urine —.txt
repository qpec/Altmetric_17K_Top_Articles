 Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report

On May 10, 2016, this report was posted as an MMWR Early 
Release on the MMWR website (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr).
Diagnostic testing for Zika virus infection can be accom-
plished using molecular and serologic methods. Real-time 
reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) 
is the preferred test for Zika virus infection because it can 
be performed rapidly and is highly specific (1,2). However, 
in most patients, Zika virus RNA is unlikely to be detected 
in serum after the first week of illness (2,3). Recent reports 
using adaptations of previously published methods (2,4) sug-
gest that Zika virus RNA can be detected in urine for at least 
2 weeks after onset of symptoms (3,5–7). Currently, the CDC 
Trioplex rRT-PCR assay is the only diagnostic tool authorized 
by the Food and Drug Administration for Zika virus testing of 
urine (1). Other laboratory-developed tests will need in-house 
validations to adequately characterize the performance of the 
assay and meet Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments 
requirements. Further investigation is needed to determine the 
sensitivity and utility of Zika virus rRT-PCR on urine speci-
mens collected ≥14 days after onset of symptoms.
On the basis of the newly available data, CDC recommends 
that Zika virus rRT-PCR be performed on urine collected 
<14 days after onset of symptoms in patients with suspected 
Zika virus disease. Zika virus rRT-PCR testing of urine should 
be performed in conjunction with serum testing if using speci-
mens collected <7 days after symptom onset (8). A positive 
result in either specimen type provides evidence of Zika virus 
infection. Procedures for the collection and submission of 
body fluids, including urine specimens, have been described 
previously (9). CDC recommendations for Zika virus testing 
of serum and other clinical specimens remain unchanged at this 
time (8). CDC will continue to review and update guidance 
for Zika virus testing as new data become available.
