Migraineurs avoid light because it intensifies their headache.
However, this is not the only reason for their aversion to light.
Studying migraineurs and control subjects, we found that lights
triggered more changes in autonomic functions and negative
emotions during, rather than in the absence of, migraine or in
control subjects, and that the association between light and
positive emotions was stronger in control subjects than migrai-
neurs. Seeking to define a neuroanatomical substrate for these
findings, we showed that, in rats, axons of retinal ganglion cells
converge on hypothalamic neurons that project directly to nuclei
in the brainstem and spinal cord that regulate parasympathetic
and sympathetic functions and contain dopamine, histamine,
orexin, melanin-concentrating hormone, oxytocin, and vasopres-
sin. Although the rat studies define frameworks for conceptualiz-
ing how light triggers the symptoms described by patients, the
human studies suggest that the aversive nature of light is more
complex than its association with headache intensification.
photophobia | parasympathetic | sympathetic | emotions | colors
P
hotophobia, defined as exacerbation of headache by light, is
common among migraine patients undergoing acute attacks
(1–3). Although most report that light increases their headache
intensity, a significant portion reports that it is predominantly
unpleasant. Either way, the need to avoid light renders migrai-
neurs dysfunctional as they are forced to quit fundamental daily
tasks to seek the comfort of darkness.
Following the notion that migraine-type photophobia is driven
by disease-related hyperexcitable visual cortex (4–7), efforts to
characterize photophobia have focused on the notion that light is
avoided because it increases visual discomfort and headache
intensity (2, 8–11) and because it gives rise to an uncomfortable
sense of glare (8). Attempting to understand better how light
intensifies the headache, we showed recently (i) that light ex-
acerbates headache intensity in blind migraineurs who perceive
light but have no sight as a result of loss of rods and cones, but
not in blind migraineurs who lack light perception as a result of
optic nerve degeneration; (ii) that retinal ganglion cells that
contain melanopsin, a photoreceptor with peak sensitivity to blue
light (12–14), converge on thalamic trigeminovascular neurons
that relay nociceptive signals from the dura to the somatosensory
and visual cortices (15); (iii) that certain colors of light exacer-
bate migraine headache more than others; and (iv) that the
amplitude of the electrical signals that are generated in the
retina and cortex of migraine patients with normal eyesight is
larger in response to colors of light that hurt more compared
with colors of light that hurt less (9). In the course of these
studies, we observed cases in which the perception that light
intensifies the headache was (i) driven by the spread of the
headache from one side of the head to the other and/or from the
front to the back (thus involving a large part of the cranium) and
(ii) that headache begun to throb rather than actually increasing
in intensity. We also documented cases in which migraineurs
reported discomfort even when the light did not cause the
headache to intensify, spread, or throb. In the open-ended in-
terview that followed the documentation of headache intensity,
spread, and throbbing, a pattern emerged in which patients
reported that their aversion to light was the result of unwanted/
unpleasant changes light caused in autonomic functions, affec-
tive responses, and physiological adjustments.
Accordingly, we hypothesized that certain colors of light
worsen migraine symptoms and/or trigger new ones by interact-
ing directly with hypothalamic neurons that regulate autonomic,
affective, and/or physiological functions, and project to brain-
stem and spinal cord nuclei that contain parasympathetic and
sympathetic preganglionic neurons, respectively. To test this hy-
pothesis, we first determined the breadth of neurological re-
sponses which, when induced, can contribute to the aversion to
light during migraine, and then mapped retinal projections to
functionally/chemically identified hypothalamic neurons, including
those regulating sympathetic and parasympathetic functions. Here
we provide clinical and preclinical insights into the aversive nature
of light during migraine.

Significance
Many migraineurs report that their need to avoid light is driven
mainly by how unpleasant it makes them feel. Seeking to un-
derstand why light is unpleasant, we show here that light can
trigger the perception of chest tightness, shortness of breath,
light-headedness, dry mouth, irritability, sadness, and fear (among
other aversive symptoms identified), and that these perceptions
are mediated by newly described neuronal pathways through
which electrical signals generated by light travel from the eye
through the hypothalamus to neurons that regulate autonomic
functions and emotions. We conclude that the aversive nature of
light during migraine is more complex than its association with
headache intensification.

 documented by using psychophysical assessments of responses to
different colors of light during and between attacks or at any time for
the healthy controls. Their demographic and headache characteris-
tics are shown in Table S1. They were 41 ± 13 y of age (mean ± SD),
mostly female (91%), with migraine history of 19 ± 14 y. Their at-
tacks lasted 60 ± 57 h, and were associated with aura (36%),
moderate to severe headache intensity (94%), unilateral location
(69%), pulsating quality (72%), nausea or vomiting (81%), and
phonophobia (81%). The 17 age-matched control subjects were
43 ± 16 y of age and were healthy with no history of migraine,
photophobia, ocular diseases, or chronic pain.
Light-induced symptoms were grouped as (i) hypothalamic-
mediated autonomic, (ii) hypothalamic nonautonomic, (iii) af-
fective negative, and (iv) affective positive responses. Description
of hypothalamic-mediated autonomic responses included the
perception of chest tightness, throat tightness, shortness of breath,
fast breathing, faster than usual heart rate, light-headedness, diz-
ziness, nausea, vomiting, dry mouth, salivation, rhinorrhea, stuffy
sinuses, and lacrimation. Description of experiences we assigned
to nonautonomic hypothalamic functions included thirst and
hunger (regulation of feeding) and feeling drowsy, tired, sleepy, or
fatigued and actual yawning (regulation of sleep). Description of
affect was comprised of negative and positive emotions. Negative
emotions were expressed most frequently with words such as in-
tense, irritable, angry, nervous, hopeless, needy, agitated, sad,
scared, cranky, upset, depressed, disappointed, jittery, worried,
stressed, anxious, panic, and fear, and by actual crying. Positive
emotions were expressed most frequently with words such as
happy, relaxing, soothing, and calming.
Psychophysical studies assessing autonomic responses, hypothalamic
functions, and affect in migraine patients and control subjects. To de-
termine if symptoms induced by nonselective (i.e., any of the five
tested colors or intensity) and selective (white, blue, green, am-
ber, red; regardless of intensity) photic stimuli depended on
whether the participant was a control subject or a migraineur
during ictal or interictal phase, we first compared the percentage
of subjects in each of these groups reporting one or more
symptoms we attributed to (i) hypothalamic-mediated auto-
nomic responses, (ii) hypothalamic nonautonomic functions,
(iii) negative emotions, and (iv) positive emotions.
i) The proportion of migraine patients in which nonselective
photic stimuli induced hypothalamic-mediated autonomic re-
sponses (Fig. 1A) was significantly higher during the ictal
(nearly 80%) than during the interictal (<40%) phase or com-
pared with the percentage of control subjects (P < 0.001;
Tables 1 and 2). This was also the case for the selective photic
stimuli (Fig. 1B), which ranged between 30% and 60% in the
ictal group, 10% and 20% in the interictal group, and 0% and
10% in the control group. As shown in Fig. 1B, each of the five
tested lights yielded a significantly higher number of autonomic
responses in the ictal phase compared with the interictal phase
or the control group (Tables 1 and 2). In contrast, the proportion
of migraine patients in which nonselective as well as selective
photic stimuli induced autonomic responses during the interictal
phase (although higher) did not differ from the proportion of
control subjects reporting these responses (Table 3).
ii) The proportion of migraine patients and control subjects
reporting that nonselective photic stimuli induced alteration in
(nonautonomic) hypothalamic functions (which ranged between
50% and 30%; Fig. 1C) was similar among the three groups
(P > 0.05; Tables 1–3). This was also the case for the selective
photic stimuli (Fig. 1D), which ranged between 10% and 20%
among the three groups (P > 0.05 for each of the five tested
lights; Tables 1–3).
iii) As with hypothalamic functions, the proportion of migraine
patients and control subjects reporting that nonselective photic
stimuli (usually in the low-intensity range of 5 and 10 cd/m2)
provoked negative emotions (which ranged between 55% and
35%; Fig. 1E) was also similar among the three groups (P >
0.05; Tables 1–3). This was also the case for the selective photic
stimuli (Fig. 1F), which ranged between 10% and 40%, 10%
and 30%, and 0% and 30% in the ictal, interictal, and control
groups, respectively (P > 0.05 for each of five tested lights;
Tables 1–3).
iv) Unlike the previously described findings, the proportion of
migraine patients and control subjects reporting that nonse-
lective photic stimuli produced positive emotions (Fig. 1G)
was significantly higher among the control subjects (80%) than
among the ictal (approximately 20%), but not interictal (ap-
proximately 30%), migraine patients (P < 0.001; Tables 2 and
3). This was also the case for the selective photic stimuli (Fig.
1H), which ranged between 0% and 20% in the ictal group,
5% and 30% in the interictal group, and 10% and 50% in the
control group. As depicted in Tables 1–3, each of the five
tested lights yielded a significantly higher number of positive
emotions in the control group compared with the ictal group
(Table 2), but not the interictal group (Table 3). In contrast,
the proportion of migraine patients in which nonselective as
well as selective photic stimuli induced positive emotions dur-
ing the interictal phase (although higher) did not differ from
the proportion of migraine patients reporting positive emo-
tions in the ictal phase (Table 1).
To determine if induction of hypothalamic-mediated autonomic
responses, alteration of hypothalamic functions, and negative
or positive affects depend on the color of light, we also per-
formed a within-group analysis whereby we assessed the effects
of white and the four different colors of light on the proportion
of ictal and interictal migraine patients and control subjects who
reported one or more symptoms of hypothalamic-mediated auto-
nomic responses (Fig. 1B), alteration in hypothalamic functions
(Fig. 1D), and negative (Fig. 1F) and positive emotions (Fig. 1H).
This analysis revealed no color preference for induction of auto-
nomic responses, alteration of hypothalamic functions, and
provocation of negative emotions within any of the three groups
(Fig. 1 B, D, and F). As indicted in Table 4, our post hoc non-
parametric binomial comparison of all pairs (e.g., green vs. red)
yielded P values that were lower than the Bonferroni-corrected α
threshold for significance. In contrast, we found color preference
in the ability to provoke positive emotions during migraine (i.e., in
the ictal phase), but not in the interictal phase or in the control
group (Fig. 1H). Although the percentage of migraine patients and
control subjects reporting positive emotions when exposed to green
light was higher than all other colors in all three groups, the post
hoc nonparametric binomial proportion comparisons demonstrated
significant differences between the response proportion to green
vs. the remaining wavelengths (considering Bonferroni-corrected
α threshold for significance) in the ictal group only (P < 0.007;
Table 4).
Preclinical Studies.
Retinal innervation of hypothalamic neurons that project to parasympathetic
and sympathetic nuclei. To delineate possible pathways for induction
of autonomic responses to light, we searched for convergence of
retinal axons on hypothalamic neurons that project to the para-
sympathetic superior salivatory nucleus (SSN) in the brainstem
and the sympathetic intermediolateral nucleus (IML) in the spinal
cord. To accomplish this, we first labeled retinal afferents in the
hypothalamus by injecting a recombinant adenoassociated viral
vector encoding for GFP (rAAV-GFP) into the eye of adult albino
rats. Three weeks later, we retrogradely labeled hypothalamic
neurons that project to the SSN and IML by filling each of these
nuclei with the retrograde tracer Fluoro-Gold (FG; Methods).

experiencing autonomic responses to nonselective (A; all colors combined) and selective [B; white (w), blue (b), green (g), amber (a), red (r)] photic stimuli.
Autonomic responses included the perception of chest tightness, throat tightness, shortness of breath, fast breathing, faster-than-usual heart rate, light-

subjects experiencing negative emotions in response to nonselective (E) and selective (F) photic stimuli. Emotions were classified negative when defined by
participants as intense, irritable, angry, nervous, hopeless, needy, agitated, sad, scared, cranky, upset, depressed, disappointed, jittery, worried, stressed,
anxious, “panic and fear,” and/or actual crying. (G and H) Proportion of migraine patients and control subjects experiencing positive emotions in response to
nonselective (G) and selective (H) photic stimuli. Emotions were classified positive when defined by participants as happy, relaxing, soothing, and/or calming.
Migraine patients were tested twice: once during the ictal and once during the interictal phase. Asterisk shows statistically significant P values (P < 0.03)
considering Bonferroni-corrected α for multiple comparisons. Note that autonomic responses to light occurred most frequently during migraine and least
frequently in control subjects, whereas most reports of positive emotions were provided by control subjects and the least by migraine patients undergoing
acute attack. Also note lack of color effect in all aspects of the study except the percentage of patients experiencing positive emotions to green light during
migraine (H) (P< 0.001).

 retinal ganglion cells were found mainly in the hypothalamic para-
ventricular nucleus (PVN) and lateral hypothalamus (LH) and
perifornical area (PeF) nuclei, where GFP-positive retinal axons and
axonal buttons were seen in close apposition to 4.6% and 2.4% of
all FG-labeled neurons, respectively (Fig. 2 A and B). Outside these
nuclei, occasional (<1%) apposition between GFP-positive retinal
axons and FG-labeled neurons were observed in the anterior hy-
pothalamus, ventrolateral preoptic nucleus, and periaqueductal
gray (PAG; Fig. 2B). We classified these neurons as belonging to
the retinohypothalamic-parasympathetic (RHP) pathway.
Neurons that project to the IML and receive direct input from
retinal ganglion cells were found in three hypothalamic nuclei:
PVN, PeF, and the dopaminergic A11 nucleus. In these nuclei,
GFP-positive axons were seen in close apposition to 3.4%, 18%,
and 26% of all FG-labeled neurons, respectively (Fig. 2 C and D).
We classified these neurons as belonging to the retinohypothalamic-
sympathetic (RHS) pathway.
Retinal innervation of chemically identified hypothalamic neurons. Given
the large number of light-induced symptoms attributed to hypo-
thalamic regulation of autonomic and endocrine functions, we
further sought to identify the neuropeptides and/or neurotrans-
mitter contained in the hypothalamic neurons that receive direct
input from the retina. To accomplish this, we performed immu-
nofluorescence with antibodies against biomarkers for dopamine/
noradrenaline, orexin, melanin concentrating hormone (MCH),
oxytocin, and vasopressin on neural tissue containing GFP-labeled
retinal afferents in the hypothalamus (Methods). GFP-positive
axons and varicosities were seen in close apposition to 9.7% and
6.7% of all tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-labeled (dopaminergic/nor-
adrenergic) neurons in the periventricular and A11 nuclei, re-
spectively, and few (<1%) such neurons in the LH (Fig. 3A); 8.2%
of all histidine decarboxylase (HDC)-labeled (histaminergic) neu-
rons in the ventral tuberomammillary nucleus and few such
neurons in the dorsal tuberomammillary (Fig. 3B); 30% of all
orexinergic neurons in the perifornical area (Fig. 3C); 2.7% of all
MCH-labeled neurons in the LH (Fig. 3D); and approximately
10% and 7% of all oxytocinergic and vasopressinergic neurons in
the PVN and supraoptic nuclei, respectively (Fig. 3 E and F).
Evidence of close apposition between retinal afferents and
hypothalamic cell bodies or dendrites is provided in Fig. S1.
Discussion
Clinically, the results of this multifaceted psychophysical study
provide insight into migraine-type photophobia and induction of
hypothalamic-mediated responses to light. By showing that light
triggers a wide range of unpleasant sensations and emotions, the
study stands to expand the definition of photophobia beyond the
commonly used criteria of “headache (intensity) that is worsened
by light.” Such expansion may explain why migraine patients
avoid light even when it does not worsen their head pain. Pre-
clinically, the study reports that axons of retinal ganglion cells
converge on hypothalamic neurons that project to the SSN (i.e.,
RHP) and IML (i.e., RHS; Fig. 4 A and B). It also reports that retinal
axons converge on dopaminergic/noradrenergic, histaminergic,
orexinergic,
MCHergic,
oxytocinergic,
and
vasopressinergic
hypothalamic neurons (Fig. 4C). These connections define
an anatomical substrate for future studies on alterations of
hypothalamic-mediated (autonomic and nonautonomic) functions
during migraine. Because the induction of all hypothalamic-
mediated unpleasant experiences was not influenced by the color
of light, it is likely that the retinohypothalamic interactions ob-
served in the study are independent of color processing by the vi-
sual cortex. This scenario differs greatly from the one showing that
the perception of headache intensity is color-specific and most
likely depends on sensory processing by the retinothalamocortical
pathway (9).
Hypothalamic-Mediated Autonomic Responses. Hypothalamic-mediated
autonomic responses are termed as such because, in the present
study, autonomic responses are interpreted as originating in ac-
tivation of hypothalamic neurons by light. The proportion of
migraine patients in which photic stimuli induced autonomic
responses was significantly higher during the ictal phase than
during the interictal phase and compared with the percentage of
control subjects. Building on the widely held view that autonomic
regulation is altered during migraine (17–21), these findings of-
fer insight into the possibility that it is hypothalamic regulation
of parasympathetic and sympathetic functions that is abnormal
during migraine, rather than the parasympathetic or sympathetic
nervous systems themselves. However, because the induction of
autonomic symptoms by light was altered during migraine only,
when hypothalamic neurons are subjected to a barrage of noci-
ceptive signals they receive from trigeminovascular/trigemino-
hypothalamic tract neurons (22, 23), one must keep in mind the
possibility that convergence of nociceptive signals from the menin-
ges and photic signals from the retina are required to produce

responses
reported here. Such a scenario can also explain why light does
not trigger abnormal autonomic responses in the interictal phase
or in control subjects. Given that some of the symptoms induced
by light include signs of sympathetic hyperresponsiveness
(i.e., chest tightness, throat tightness, shortness of breath,
fast breathing, faster-than-usual heart rate, dry mouth) whereas
others point to parasympathetic hyper responsiveness (i.e., light-
headedness, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, rhinorrhea, lacrimation),
and based on the discovery of the RHP and RHS pathways, we
propose that photic signals modulate the activity of hypothalamic
neurons, which, in turn, activate preganglionic parasympathetic
and sympathetic neurons in the SSN and IML, respectively
(Fig. 4 A and B). Because many of the mentioned symptoms
disappeared after a few minutes in the dark, it will be interesting
to determine whether dark may have inhibitory effect on these

 RHP and RHS pathways in animals or on the incidence of auto-
nomic symptoms in migraineurs.
Mechanistically, we propose that photic stimulation of RHP
neurons in the paraventricular, lateral, perifornical, and anterior
hypothalamic nuclei, as well as in the ventrolateral preoptic area
and PAG, mediate the so-called parasympathetic symptoms.
Supporting this proposal are previous documentations of neu-
rons in these nuclei that project to the SSN (24–26), regulate
parasympathetic functions (27, 28), and, independent of these,
regulate a variety of circadian rhythms by firing differently under
light and dark conditions (i.e., light-sensitive) (29–31). Similarly,
we propose that photic stimulation of RHS neurons in the par-
aventricular, perifornical, and dopaminergic A11 nuclei mediate
the sympathetic symptoms. Previous identification of neurons in
these nuclei that project to the IML (32–34), regulate sympa-
thetic functions (35–37), and respond to light (29–31) further
supports this scenario. Therapeutically, the treatment of photo-
phobia by blocking the sympathetic superior cervical ganglion
(38, 39) may be mediated at least in part by the consequential
reduction in some of the more unpleasant sympathetic responses
to light described here.
Hypothalamic-Mediated Nonautonomic Responses. Hypothalamic
mediated nonautonomic responses are termed as such because the
execution of sleep and food intake behaviors is believed to be
regulated by the hypothalamus. The induction of hypothalamic-
mediated nonautonomic responses to light was not specific
to migraine patients or to the migraine attacks. It occurred in
10–20% of the participants, regardless of whether they were
migraineurs or nonmigraineurs or whether they were at the ictal
or interictal state. Because light modulation of physiological
functions associated with sleep (i.e., feeling drowsy, tired, sleepy,
fatigued) (29, 30, 40) and food intake (i.e., thirst, hunger) (41,
42) occur in all mammals, it was somewhat expected that light
will trigger these symptoms to a certain extent in all participants.
However, as sleep deprivation and extended fasting are among
the most common migraine triggers (43–45), we were surprised
by the findings that these hypothalamically regulated functions
did not occur more often in the migraineurs than in the control
subjects. Interpretation of this finding must take into consider-
ation the relatively brief period (i.e., minutes) that patients were
exposed to light, as it may differ greatly from real-life prolonged
(i.e., hours) exposure to light. It should also take into consider-
ation the possibility that migraine does not alter the fundamental
physiological functions of hypothalamic neurons that mediate
sleep and food intake.
Affective Responses. The induction of negative emotions by light
was not specific to migraine patients or to whether they were un-
dergoing a migraine attack. Although it was reported by more
migraine patients during the ictal than the interictal phase, and by
more migraine patients during the interictal phase than the control
subjects, the differences were insignificant. Because blue, red, and
amber lights increase headache intensity more than green light (9),
we initially thought that the incidence of negative emotions would
be higher during exposure to all colors but green. The current
findings, however, challenge our (oversimplistic) view that head
pain alone may be the principal driver of negative emotions during
migraine. In fact, the description of negative emotions in the
interictal phase and in the control subjects suggests that the prin-
cipal driver is light rather than pain. Although this explanation is
reasonable, the understanding of how colors affect emotions, al-
though heavily studied (46–48), is extremely limited for lack of
hypothesis-driven experiments and scientific data (49).
In contrast, the incidence of light-induced positive emotions
such as happiness, relaxing, soothing, and calming was signifi-
cantly higher in the control subjects than in the ictal migraineurs.
This observation unravels yet another perspective of the “dislike
of light” during migraine. As for the effects of color on the in-
duction of positive emotions among control subjects and inter-
ictal migraineurs, there was none, suggesting that the distribution
of color preference in the absence of migraine is nearly even (i.e.,
the number of individuals who like red, blue, green and amber is
similar). This was not the case, however, during migraine. In fact,
the only color preference found in this study was the one showing
that green is the only color capable of inducing positive emotions
during acute attack. This preference may be secondary to the
unique ability of green light to reduce headache intensity (9).
Retinal Innervation of Peptidergic Neurons. The present study
found that retinal axons contact dopaminergic/monoaminergic
neurons in the periventricular and A11 nuclei, histaminergic
neurons in the tuberomammillary nuclei, orexinergic neurons
in the perifornical area (but not lateral or medial nuclei),
MCHergic neurons in the LH, and oxytocinergic and vaso-
pressinergic neurons in the paraventricular and supraoptic nu-
clei. They expand the scope of retinohypothalamic projections
described previously (50–53). In the context of the present study,
it is tempting to propose that modulation of these peptidergic
hypothalamic neurons by light, which, at best, is incompletely
documented (54–56), may trigger some of the affective, auto-
nomic, and hypothalamic symptoms. Specifically, altered dopa-
minergic activity can facilitate anger and irritability (57–60), fear,
panic, anxiety, and stress (61), altered oxytocinergic activity
can reduce stress, anxiety, and fear and facilitate the relaxing,
calming, soothing, and happy affects (62, 63); altered orexinergic,
MCHergic, and histaminergic activity can facilitate the perception
of sleepiness and hunger (64–66), altered vasopressinergic activity

 can facilitate thirst (67), and many of these peptidergic neurons
can promote yawning (68, 69), salivation (70, 71), lacrimation,
nasal congestion, and rhinorrhea (64). Given that many of these
peptides and neurotransmitters regulate each other’s secretion,
that they can be antagonistic to each other in one area of the brain
and synergistic in another, and that their overall activity may de-
pend on a variety of internal and external cues, we must acknowl-
edge that the examples provided here are vastly oversimplified.
Along this line, we must acknowledge that our classification of
symptoms, although logical and phenotypically justified, is also
oversimplified, as hypothalamic regulation of autonomic, en-
docrine, physiological, behavioral, and affective responses is
achieved by reciprocal connections it makes with cortical, sub-
cortical, and spinal cord neurons that play established role is the
processing of sensory and visceral information as well as cognition
and emotions.
Methods
Clinical Study. All study visits took place at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical
Center (BIDMC), Boston, MA (September 2010 to May 2015). The BIDMC
Committee on Clinical Investigations approved the study, and all participants
provided written informed consent. Patients were recruited from the BIDMC
Comprehensive Headache Center, Neurology Clinic, and the primary care
practice and from flyers placed in and around BIDMC and Harvard Medical
School. Women and men who were 15–85 y old were potentially eligible for
the study if they met the International Classification of Headache Disorders
Committee (16) criteria for migraine with or without aura, were able to
communicate in English, and were willing to attend a visit during an un-
treated migraine attack and when migraine-free for 3 d or more. Exclusion
criteria included fewer than five headache-free days per month, chronic
head or neck pain not attributed to migraine, chronic use of opioids (≥ 15 d/mo
for previous consecutive 3 mo or longer), or the presence of an ocular dis-
ease. For this study, ocular diseases were defined as primary and persisting
visual disorders such as glaucoma, macular degeneration, retinal degenerative
diseases, cone dystrophy, rod dystrophy, achromatopsia, retinitis pigmentosa,
Leber’s congenital amaurosis, albinism, night blindness, or cortical blindness as a
result of posterior circulation stroke. Participants were permitted to stop the
study or any phase of testing at any time. Age-matched control subjects were
also recruited from BIDMC’s primary care practice and from flyers placed in and
around BIDMC and Harvard Medical School. Their medical interview revealed
no history of headache or migraine, no chronic pain or use of opioids, and no
ocular diseases.
Psychophysical studies assessing patients’ responses to different colors of light
during and in between migraine attacks. The study included 81 migraine pa-
tients and 17 healthy subjects. Of the 81 migraineurs, 44 completed the
psychophysical assessments during untreated migraine attack, whereas
69 completed it after being migraine-free for at least 3 d. Before testing,
patients sat in a dimly lit room for 20 min. The light was then turned off for
3 min, and patients were asked to describe their symptoms (baseline). When a
baseline had been established, participants were positioned in front of a full-
field Ganzfeld ColorDome (Diagnosys), the light was turned on to the lowest
intensity (1 cd·m−2) and then increased (1, 5, 20, 50, and 100 cd·m−2) every
30 seconds, and this was repeated for each color. The first light was white,
the second was blue (447 ± 10 nm), the third was green (530 ± 10 nm), the
fourth was amber (590 ± 10 nm), and the fifth was red (627 ± 10 nm). To
minimize additive effects, patients sat in total darkness for 3 min between
consecutive series of stimulation or until their headache intensity or their
physiological and emotional responses returned to baseline level.
To assess the effects that different colors of light had, subjects were asked
to describe what they experienced while looking at the light. To minimize
bias, subjects were not provided with a list of words that describe different
experiences. Rather, they were given the same verbal examples of physio-
logical (light-headedness, shortness of breath) and emotional (depressed,
anxious, happy, soothing) responses and were told to come up with their own
words to describe what they felt. They were also told that they might ex-
perience some or none of these or experience other physiological or emo-
tional responses, that they should not feel pressured to report anything
unless they experienced it, that they could not go wrong, and that whatever
they reported was right. Consequently, subjects used a wide variety of words
to describe their experiences. In our previous study (9), we were able to
quantitatively explore the effects of different colors of light and their in-
tensities on headache rating during migraine. In the present study, however,
we focused on documenting whether specific symptoms were elicited in
response to the applied stimuli, rather than delineating those symptoms’
magnitudes. In keeping, reported symptoms were addressed as a binary
variable (“yes” or “no”). Notably, most of the patients who reported a
symptom as a response to a specific light color at a certain intensity (i.e., blue
at 20 cd·m−2) persistently reported the same symptom at greater intensities
of the same color (e.g., 50 and 100 cd·m−2).
To reduce the number of variables, we analyzed the most frequently used
words and grouped them into four prespecified domains: (i) hypothalamic-
mediated autonomic, (ii) hypothalamic (nonautonomic), (iii) affective neg-
ative, and (iv) affective positive responses (a full list of light-induced re-
sponses is provided in Results).
Preclinical Studies.
Animals. All experimental procedures were approved by the institutional
animal care and use committee at Harvard Medical School and Beth Israel
Deaconess Medical Center and conducted in accordance with the National
Institutes of Health (NIH) Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.
We used 45 male Sprague–Dawley rats weighting 250–350 g. Rats were
housed in a controlled environment (22 °C room temperature; 12-h light/
dark cycle) with free access to food and water.
Anterograde labeling of retinal afferents. To identify projection sites of retinal
axons in the hypothalamus, we injected 5 μL rAAV-GFP into the vitreous body
of one eye. By using a Nanofil syringe, rAAV-GFP (serotype 2; 7 × 1012 ge-
nome copies per milliliter) was injected under brief isoflurane anesthesia.
Twenty-one days later, rats were deeply anesthetized with an overdose of
pentobarbital sodium (100 mg/kg i.p.), and perfused with 200 mL heparin-
ized saline solution, followed by 500 mL of 4% paraformaldehyde and
0.05% picric acid in 0.1 M PBS solution. Brains were removed from the skull,
soaked in the fixative solution for 2 h, and cryoprotected in 30% sucrose
phosphate buffer for 48 h. Brains were then frozen and cut into serial co-
ronal sections (80-μm thick) by using a cryostat (Leica) and prepared
for immunofluorescence.
Retrograde labeling of hypothalamic neurons that project to parasympathetic
preganglionic SSN in the brainstem or preganglionic sympathetic IML in the spinal
cord. To determine whether retinal axons project to the vicinity of hypo-
thalamic neurons that mediate parasympathetic and sympathetic responses,
we injected the retrograde tracer FG (2% hydroxystilbamidine in dH2O;
Fluorochrome) into the SSN of 16 rats and IML of 14 rats previously (17 d
earlier) injected with the anterograde tracer rAAV-GFP into the eye. To in-
ject these autonomic nuclei, rats were briefly anesthetized with a single dose
of Brevital sodium (45 mg/kg i.p.) to allow endotracheal intubation. They
were then mounted on a stereotaxic frame and connected to a gas anes-
thesia system for the rest of the procedure (O2/isoflurane 2.5% for crani-
otomy or laminectomy; 1–1.2% for maintenance, delivered at 100 mL/min).
End-tidal CO2, respiratory and heart rate, blood oxygen saturation, and body
temperature were continuously monitored and kept within a physiological
range. For targeting the SSN, a small craniotomy was performed in the
interparietal bone at ∼2 mm lateral/1.8 caudal to lambda. A glass micropi-
pette (20–40-μm tip diameter) loaded with FG was lowered through the
craniotomy into the SSN (8–9 mm depth) for microiontophoretic release of
the tracer by applying direct positive current (5–10 μA, on/off cycles, 10 s per
cycle) over 10–15 min as described elsewhere (15). A similar injection para-
digm was used to fill the IML. To reach the IML, a partial laminectomy of
T5 vertebra was performed. As the IML extends throughout the thoracic
spinal cord, two or three microinjections were performed along the ros-
trocaudal axis by placing the glass micropipette 0.5–1.0 mm from the midline
of the spinal cord and 0.7–1.0 mm deep. After the injection, micropipettes
were pulled out of the brainstem/spinal cord, wounds were sutured and
disinfected, pain medication was provided (Meloxicam SR, 4mg/kg; Zoo-
pharm) and rats were put back in their cages. Three days after FG injections,
rats were perfused, brain and spinal cord removed, and neural tissue pre-
pared for staining as described earlier.
Immunofluorescence labeling of hypothalamic neuropeptides and neurotransmitters.
To determine which peptidergic neurons in the hypothalamus receive retinal
input, free-floating sections containing GFP-positive retinal afferents were
preincubated at room temperature in PBS solution containing 2% blocking
serum and 1% Triton X-100 for 1 h. Sections were then incubated at 4 °C for
48 h in the latter solution with one of the following primary antibodies:
(i) mouse anti-TH (1:5,000; Immunostar), (ii) goat anti-orexin A (1:2,500;
Santa Cruz), (iii) rabbit anti-oxytocin (1:10,000; Immunostar), (iv) goat anti-
vasopressin (1:1,000; Immunostar), (v) guinea pig anti-HDC (1:1,000; ARP),
and (vi) rabbit anti-MCH (1:1,000; gift from Terry Maratos-Flier, Harvard
Medical School, Boston, MA). The sections were washed multiple times and
then incubated for 1–2 h at room temperature with the corresponding
fluorescent secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 594; Invitrogen) against the Igs

 of the animal in which the primary antibody was raised (dilution range,
1:200–1:1,000). Immunostained sections were serially mounted on glass
slides and coverslipped with fluorescent mounting media (Vector).
Identification of FG injection sites. To precisely identify and delimit FG injection
sites in SSN or IML, free-floating sections were taken from rats injected 3 d
earlier with FG into the SSN or IML and processed in the following sequence:
(i) quenching with 3:1 methanol/PBS solution containing 1% H2O2 for 1 h;
(ii) preincubation with PBS solution containing 2% normal goat serum and
1% Triton X-100 for 1 h; (iii) incubation with the rabbit anti-FG primary
antibody (1:5,000; Millipore) for 48 h at 4 °C; (iv) rinsing with PBS solution
and incubation with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody
(1:500; Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 2 h; and (v) rinsing, amplification, and
labeling using ABC complex and DAB-nickel kits (Vector).
Digital imaging of fluorescent labeling. Digital imaging of GFP retinal afferents,
FG-labeled neurons, and hypothalamic neurons immunopositive for the
tested neuropeptides/neurotransmitters was performed by using epifluor-
escence scanning microscopy that compiled 1–1.5-μm-thick scans using
z-stacking software (Leica). Immunofluorescence labeling of GFP and FG were
detected by excitation/emission at 445/520 nm (green) and 360/408 nm
(blue), respectively. For neuropeptides labeled with Alexa Fluor 594, the
signal was detected by excitation/emission at 590/617 nm (red). In cases in
which DAPI counterstaining was used, labeling was detected by excitation/
emission at 358/461 nm (blue). Photomicrographs of colabeling were
obtained by superimposition of green, red, and blue images. The anatomical
delimitation and localization of fluorescent labeling was based on an atlas
of the rat brain (72).
Calibration and Quantification of Photic Stimulation. Repeated calibrations
of the ColorDome with an International Light Technologies photometer
(ILT1700) and an Ocean Optics Maya LSL spectrometer were used to verify
that the different colors of light were delivered at equal luminance. For
example, when the nominal luminance was set at 3 cd·m−2 in Espion software
(Diagnosys), the luminance measurements for blue, green, amber, and red
were 2.96, 3.0, 3.36, and 2.76 cd·m−2, respectively. To ensure that each of
these colors appeared to be exactly the same luminance to our participants
(i.e., taking into account differences in photopic sensitivity of the human
retina), the ColorDome delivered different power with each photic stimulus.
When the luminance measurements for blue, green, amber, and red were
2.96, 3.0, 3.36, and 2.76 cd·m−2, the respective power measurements were
32.2, 1.9, 2.1, and 4.9 μW·cm−2/nM.
Statistical Analysis. Data obtained in the psychophysical studies in migraine
patients and control subjects were analyzed by using SPSS Statistics (version
22; IBM). χ2 tests were used for comparing percentages of patients and
controls (independent samples) who exhibited specific symptoms (auto-
nomic, affective negative, affective positive, or hypothalamic) in response to
the administered visual stimuli of different wave lengths (white, blue, green,
amber, red) within and between the various conditions (ictal/interictal vs.
healthy controls). To avoid bias of any kind, response to stimuli was pro-
cessed as a binary variable based on whether subjects reported a reaction to
a specific experimental condition, regardless of the used number of words.
McNemar–Bowker tests were used to examine proportion differences be-
tween the migraine patients’ conditions (ictal, interictal) so as to account
for differences in repeated dichotomous measures. Post hoc nonparametric
binomial proportion comparisons were used to detect effects of visual
stimuli of different wavelengths (response proportion). As six analyses were
conducted (one per symptom category), a Bonferroni correction was ad-
ministered to yield a threshold α-value of 0.0083 (i.e., the standard 5% di-
vided by six comparisons); this correction prevented a significant result by
chance alone.
