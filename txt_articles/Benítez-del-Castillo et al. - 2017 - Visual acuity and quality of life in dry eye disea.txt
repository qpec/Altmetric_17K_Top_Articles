Abstract 
Dry eye disease (DED) results in tear film instability and hyperosmolarity, inflammation of 
the ocular surface and, ultimately, visual disturbance that can significantly impact a patient’s 
quality of life. The effects on visual acuity result in difficulties with driving, reading and 
computer use and negatively impact psychological health. These effects also extend to the 
workplace, with a loss of productivity and quality of work causing substantial economic 
losses. The effects of DED and the impact on vision experienced by patients may not be 
given sufficient importance by ophthalmologists. Functional visual acuity (FVA) is a measure 
of visual acuity after sustained eye opening without blinking for at least 10 s and mimics the 
sustained visual acuity of daily life. Measuring dynamic FVA allows the detection of impaired 
visual function in patients with DED who may display normal conventional visual acuity. 
There are currently several tests and methods that can be used to measure dynamic visual 
function: the SSC-350 FVA measurement system, assessment of best-corrected visual 
acuity decay using the interblink visual acuity decay test, serial measurements of ocular and 
corneal higher order aberrations, and measurement of dynamic vision quality using the 
Optical Quality Analysis System. Although the equipment for these methods may be too 
large or unaffordable for use in clinical practice, FVA testing is an important assessment for 
DED.

1. Introduction 
Dry eye disease (DED) is a multifactorial disease of the tears and ocular surface that results 
in visual disturbance and tear film instability, among other symptoms (Figure 1). It is 
accompanied by increased osmolarity of the tear film and inflammation of the ocular 
surface.1,2 The tear film is the first part of the ocular surface that light meets on the pathway 
to the retina, and the large refractive index step from the air to the tears means that the 
precorneal tear film has the greatest dioptric power of any optical interface of the eye.3,4 
Furthermore, the tear film compensates for the optical irregularity of the corneal epithelium 
surface, which is caused by the presence of numerous microvilli; without this compensation 
by the tear film, the quality of the transmitted light would be poor. As the retinal image 
depends upon light passing through the optical structures, the composition and homogeneity 
of the tear film may have a huge impact on the quality of the retinal image.5  
The tear film is inherently unstable and undergoes irregular disruptions following a blink, 
causing tear film break-up.4 The resulting irregularity in the thickness of the tear film across 
the ocular surface will have a negative effect on the quality of this most important ocular 
dioptre, which normally has a refractive power of 48.35D.3,4 It has been well documented 
that in eyes with a short tear film break-up time (TBUT), optical quality deteriorates 
significantly more quickly after the blink than it does in normal eyes.5,6 Patients with DED 
typically have a shorter TBUT than normal controls,5,7 and these patients show a reduction in 
visual acuity over time after holding the eye open for a few seconds.8 As will be discussed 
later, an important impact of the short TBUT in patients with DED is an increased blink rate.9 
The use of artificial tears in patients with DED has been shown to significantly improve visual 
acuity (mean acuity gain of +2.33 optotypes, which was considered to be highly significant in 
the study) and spatial contrast sensitivity, further supporting the importance of the role of the 
tear film in visual function.10,11 
External factors that lead to DED include a low-humidity environment and contact lens use, 
while internal conditions may include, but are not limited to, Sjögren’s syndrome, meibomian

gland dysfunction (MGD), connective tissue disorders, Graves’ disease, chronic graft-vs-
host disease, pseudoexfoliation syndrome and skin diseases (e.g. ocular rosacea).12,13  
In this review, we examined the effects of DED on functional visual acuity (FVA) and their 
impact on the quality of life (QoL) of patients with DED. 
2. Reduced visual function can adversely impact quality of life in patients with 
DED 
With increased severity of DED, patients with DED report deficits in perception of overall 
health and vitality compared with the general population, and the most severely affected 
patients report the worst health-related QoL over all scales.14,15 The physical impact of DED 
appears to be closely related to the concept of DED as a type of chronic pain syndrome, 
particularly relating to changes in corneal sensitivity,16 resulting in chronic ocular surface 
discomfort that impacts a number of aspects of QoL.17 Patients with DED have reported 
lower scores for mental health when compared with normal controls, indicating that the 
disorder has an adverse impact not only on physical health but also on psychological health. 
Although few published studies have reported the psychological status of patients with DED, 
these studies showed that patients with DED were more anxious and depressed compared 
with patients without DED.18,19 A large (n = 662) cross-sectional, observational clinical study 
to investigate depression in patients with DED found that depression was common and 
associated with increased severity of dry eye symptoms (p ≤ 0.001).20  
DED may also have a serious impact on sleep and mood; a survey of 730 eye clinic patients 
who completed a questionnaire containing the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and 
Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) showed that the prevalence of sleep and 
mood disorders was significantly higher in patients with DED (n = 247) compared with 
patients with other ocular conditions (e.g. glaucoma, retinal disease and cataracts).21 In 
addition, a cross-sectional survey of 437 participants to assess sleep patterns and DED 
concluded that sleep disturbance was associated with DED in both men and women (odds

ratio 3.21 [95% confidence interval 1.56–6.63] and 1.74 [95% confidence interval 1.08–2.82], 
respectively).22 
The QoL issues experienced by patients with DED extend further than just the discomfort of 
the dry eye; the significant impact on visual function due to DED can diminish a patient’s 
quality of everyday living.23 Although best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) may appear to be 
normal in most patients with DED,24 in some patients, DED may reduce BCVA down to near-
blindness, for example in those with chronic graft-vs-host disease where visual acuity may 
be as low as 20/115 (Snellen acuity).25 Visual function has been shown objectively to be 
impaired during specific driving situations in patients with DED as compared with normal 
controls, and reduced driving visual performance was demonstrated to be correlated with 
ocular optical aberrations and patient-reported QoL.26 Drivers with DED may experience 
visual disturbances, particularly on approaches to roundabouts or at crossroads26 and as 
they get older,27 which causes obvious safety concerns. Readers with DED may have lower 
reading rates compared with readers not suffering from DED,28,29 and computer users with 
DED may experience reduced productivity and lower mental performance.30-32 For the busy 
general ophthalmologist, the chronic effects of DED may not be well measured and the 
subsequent impact on patients’ vision and QoL may be under-recognised. 
An important effect of a decrease in visual acuity is reduced quality of work; presenteeism 
(productivity loss when an employee comes to work but is not fully productive) is a reported 
consequence of DED and may be underestimated.33 Studies of patients with DED suggest 
that DED interferes with work between 184 and 208 days per year and results in 2–5 days 
off work per year, suggesting that presenteeism is a greater issue than absenteeism for 
patients with DED.34 This interference with daily working life may have a substantial 
economic impact; one study including 74 patients with DED estimated that DED was 
responsible for a productivity loss of > US$5000 per patient per year.35 The increased rates 
of depression and stress and lower levels of happiness reported by patients with DED

compared with patients without DED may also impact productivity in work and personal 
tasks.18,36,37 
3. Detecting visual impairment in DED by measuring Functional Visual Acuity 
FVA has been defined as visual acuity measured after sustained eye opening without 
blinking for at least 10 s using the same spectacles as ordinary BCVA testing.8 This is 
supposed to mimic what happens during common daily activities that usually suppress 
blinking (i.e., activities involving gazing), such as reading, driving and working at a 
computer.8,15,17,26 The longer gap between blinks that result from gazing allows a longer time 
for disruption of the tear film and, hence, vision problems.2,8 Measuring FVA should allow 
detection of masked impairment of visual function in patients with DED who complain of 
decreased visual acuity despite normal conventional visual acuity.38 In a normal clinical 
setting, conventional visual acuity tests may not accurately measure all aspects of visual 
function; patients are able to blink as much as necessary to compensate for a dysfunctional 
and unstable tear film, and this may result in normal visual acuity measurements using 
standard testing.9,39 Indeed, when not gazing, patients with DED blink twice as frequently 
compared with normal subjects.9 Patients with more severe DED symptoms may experience 
difficulty in keeping their eyes open during vision-intensive tasks.39 This may affect daily 
activities, such as using laptops or smartphones, with a negative impact on social life and 
leisure time and a consequent deterioration of the patient’s QoL. Furthermore, the area of 
the exposed ocular surface varies with the task; looking upwards, for example at a television 
screen, results in a wider palpebral fissure than looking down, for example at a laptop. 
Greater exposure of the ocular surface results in a higher tear evaporation rate.40 
The relationship between FVA measurements and dry eye testing methods has been 
extensively investigated by Tsubota and his research group. In a prospective comparative 
case series involving 30 patients with DED and 25 patients with normal eyes, the group 
showed significant correlation between FVA measures made under natural blinking

conditions without topical anaesthesia and dry eye test parameters such as tear quantity, 
tear stability and ocular surface vital staining scores.41 In a separate study involving 22 
patients with Sjögren’s syndrome, they demonstrated that change in FVA was as reliable as 
wavefront aberration measurements for evaluating visual performance in dry eyes.42 
One result of the increased rate of blinking is that patients with DED have a significantly 
greater lid-closure time per minute compared with the general population (4.5% vs 0.7% in 
controls; p < 0.001).9 Furthermore, during visual tasks, patients with DED have significantly 
more super extended lid closures of > 0.5 s compared with controls (2.3% vs 0.2% of 
recorded blinks; p = 0.023), with a significantly decreased inter-blink interval of 2.56 vs 5.97 
s in controls (p < 0.004).9,43 It would be very interesting to study further whether this 
increased blink rate and lid-closure time is troublesome for patients with DED. 
The alterations in visual function associated with DED are manifestations of tear film 
instability, as previously noted. A commonly used clinical test to identify tear instability is 
measuring TBUT.44 Alternative tests which are also easily accessible to the clinician include 
tear osmolarity which is closely linked to tear instability.45 
Ophthalmologists may not be testing visual acuity in patients with DED in the correct way for 
two main reasons: lack of understanding of the relevance of FVA loss in patients with DED, 
and lack of suitable, commercially available testing equipment. Questionnaires such as the 
Ocular Surface Disease Index, Impact of Dry Eye on Everyday Life and the National Eye 
Institute Visual Function Questionnaire are simple yet valuable tools for initial assessment of 
the effects of DED on patients’ visual function and QoL,17,46-48 but they only assess the 
subjective (self-reported) aspects of FVA and probably are not the ideal tools to give an 
accurate idea of the real, objectively measured FVA (objective, not self-reported).

4. Methods of assessing FVA 
There is a clear need for appropriate testing of visual acuity in the clinical setting. This 
testing needs to be dynamic in order to measure FVA accurately. Table 1 describes dynamic 
FVA tests that are currently available. Goto et al. were the first to develop a way to measure 
FVA, which is associated with sustained eye opening; this is in contrast to BCVA, which may 
be accompanied by frequent blinking.8 After 10 s of sustained eye opening, the surface 
regularity index (SRI) was measured using corneal topography as a surrogate assessment 
of visual function. In an interventional, comparative trial of patients with non-Sjögren's 
syndrome DED, patients with Sjögren's syndrome DED and normal controls, BCVA, as 
measured by the SRI when blinking freely, did not differ significantly between study groups 
(1.18, 1.15 and 1.27, respectively).8 However, FVA, as measured by the SRI 10–20 s after a 
blink, was significantly decreased compared with BCVA in the two DED patient groups to 
0.336 (p = 0.007) and 0.228 (p < 0.00001), respectively, but in the control group, FVA 
remained similar to BCVA (1.16).8 A continuous Functional Visual Acuity Measurement 
(FVAM) system (SSC-350, NIDEK, Gamagori, Japan) was proposed by Ishida et al. in 2005. 
When FVA was measured in patients with DED at 10, 20 and 30 s after a blink, mean FVA 
scores were significantly lower than those in normal controls at each time point (p < 0.05).49 
As the FVAM system continues to develop, its applications may be expanded to include an 
assessment of a patient’s vision for daily activities in disease states other than DED.38 
A different FVAM system (Kowa Co Ltd., Nagoya, Japan) has been developed to assess 
change in visual acuity over time (Figure 2A).50 The system measures FVA over a 60-s 
period without topical anaesthesia and with blinking permitted, under normal daily vision 
correction.51 The self-contained patient interface device displays black Landolt optotypes on 
a white screen. Small optotypes are displayed at the start of the assessment; if the patient 
response is correct, even smaller optotypes are presented. If the responses are incorrect, 
larger optotypes are presented automatically (Figure 2B).

The key measurements recorded by the Kowa system are baseline visual acuity, FVA (mean 
value of time-wise changes in visual acuity during examination), visual maintenance ratio 
(FVA divided by baseline visual acuity value), maximal visual acuity (highest visual acuity 
during the measurement period), minimal visual acuity (the lowest visual acuity score during 
the measurement period), response reaction time and blink frequency (Fig 2C).51 Figure 3 
shows representative patterns of FVA in a normal case, a patient with DED and short TBUT 
and a patient with aqueous deficient DED. Figure 4 shows a representative case of FVA 
before and after punctal plug insertion. FVA in this patient improved from 0.543 to 1.112 
following insertion of punctal plugs (case courtesy of Dr Minako Kaido, Tokyo, Japan). 
Contrast sensitivity in patients with DED has been assessed using the Contrast Glare Tester 
CGT-1000 (Takagi Ophthalmic Instruments, Manchester, UK). Contrast sensitivity, with and 
without glare, was significantly reduced in patients with DED compared with that in control 
subjects.52 The Inter-blink interval Visual Acuity Decay (IVAD) test is a computer-based 
measure of BCVA decay between blinks and is conducted without the use of an 
anaesthetic.53 A rotating Landolt ‘C’ was presented at the response pace of each patient so 
that the decay in visual acuity between blinks could be measured. Walker et al. reported 
that, compared with patients with DED, normal age-matched controls were able to maintain 
their BCVA for significantly longer (p = 0.0001). In addition, controls had a longer interblink 
interval while performing the task than the DED patients (p = 0.002).53 Torkildsen used the 
IVAD test to investigate the effects of artificial tears on visual decay in patients with DED.54 
By using a standardised test for all patients before and after treatment, the test provided an 
accurate representation of the effects of DED treatments on visual function.54 
Degradations of optical quality are known to be affected by light scattering and higher order 
aberrations (HOAs); a study of 55 patients (35 with DED) demonstrated that ocular forward 
light scattering and corneal backward light scattering from the anterior cornea were greater 
in dry eyes compared with normal eyes (p < 0.05).55 Quantitative serial measurements of 
HOAs and forward light scatter have been used to measure efficacy of eyedrops on optical

quality in patients with DED.56,57 In addition, a study of 40 patients with DED and 40 age- 
and gender-matched controls assessed the correlation between the time course of corneal 
and ocular wavefront HOAs after blinking, and both patient-reported QoL and clinical 
examination results.58 Serial measurements of corneal and ocular wavefront aberrations 
were performed for 10 s after blinking (simulating gazing) using the KR-1W aberrometer 
(Topcon, Clichy, France). It was demonstrated that the time course of HOAs after a blink 
accurately correlates with both the clinical examination and patient-centred visual outcomes, 
suggesting that this assessment could have utility as a method to both diagnose DED and 
assess efficacy of DED treatments in clinical trials.58 
Visiometrics (Terassa, Spain) have developed the next generation of the Optical Quality 
Analysis System (OQAS), the HD Analyzer. This diagnostic system provides a measure of 
light scatter (objective scattering index [OSI]), which is not measurable using traditional 
wavefront aberrometry. Therefore, this provides an objective measure that is correlated with 
visual function.59 Furthermore, this technique can be used to evaluate the efficacy of 
treatment, for example the effect of artificial tears on vision.60 Figure 5 shows the effect of 
DED on the OSI output and subsequent visual function. The mean OSI score of the control 
subject (0.54) was lower than that of the patient with DED (4.73). This result would suggest 
reduced visual function in patients with DED compared with controls. Tan et al. have used 
the OQAS for testing retinal-image quality in patients with DED to evaluate dynamic changes 
when patients were allowed to blink as normal. Patients with DED had significant alterations 
in optical quality compared with control subjects, and optical quality was significantly lower in 
patients with severe disease than in patients with mild disease.61 It would be very interesting 
to study further the correlation between the OQAS and other aberrometry measures and 
FVA from the patient’s perspective.  
Unfortunately, many of the dynamic assessments for visual acuity are not commercially 
available, can be challenging to perform or are used largely for research purposes. 
Moreover, the general ophthalmologist may not be aware that DED-associated reductions in

visual function can only be identified with dynamic rather than classical vision testing, i.e. 
assessing changes in visual function over time after a blink.  
5. Impact of DED-related vision alterations on other ocular conditions 
DED is common in patients with glaucoma, often due to eye drops that are used to reduce 
the intraocular pressure.62,63 As DED can affect vision due to corneal changes and tear film 
instability, this may result in misleading visual acuity or visual field test results.64 A decrease 
in the visual function of patients with glaucoma may be mistaken for glaucomatous or non-
specific visual field defects, when it is in fact caused by DED. It is therefore important that 
glaucoma patients are treated appropriately for DED and that their condition is not 
erroneously managed as a deterioration of glaucoma-related  visual field defects.64 
Following the administration of artificial tears to patients with glaucoma prior to automated 
perimetry, both the results and the reliability of visual acuity testing were improved.64-66  
In a similar way, the presence of DED in patients requiring ocular surgery, e.g. cataract 
surgery with intraocular lens (IOL) implantation or refractive surgery, may result in incorrect 
assessments of visual function or keratometric values prior to surgery. For example, when 
choosing the power of IOL required for a cataract surgery patient, any effect on visual 
function related to DED needs to be taken into account in order to select the correct power 
of the lens.67-69 This is especially true for multifocal lenses. In the postoperative setting, the 
presence of DED may reduce postoperative visual function below the expected level; DED 
therapy can improve visual function in patients who were dissatisfied with visual outcomes 
after multifocal IOL implantation and may reduce the need for more invasive or intensive 
treatment options.70,71 
The presence of DED is also an important factor in the preoperative assessment of patients 
undergoing refractive surgery, such as laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) and 
photorefractive keratectomy; the corneal epithelium can be thinner in dry eyes compared 
with normal eyes, and this may influence the corneal topography and preoperative

evaluation for refractive surgery in patients with DED.72 The introduction of automated, non-
invasive measures of TBUT in a number of widely available preoperative devices has 
enabled early assessments of the quality of the tear film surface to be made prior to surgery, 
thus ensuring that all appropriate allowances for the presence of DED are made.73 
DED may also have an impact on patients after LASIK surgery; postoperative DED is very 
common, being reported in up to 50% of patients at 1 week after surgery and 20–40% of 
patients at 6 months.74 Indeed, it has been shown that tear secretion may be reduced for up 
to 9 months post surgery.75 DED itself is a primary cause of dissatisfaction post surgery76 
and, importantly, may have a negative effect on vision. Patients with low refractive errors 
following LASIK surgery have improvements in visual function when tear film integrity is 
restored, e.g. with the insertion of punctal plugs.77,78 
6. Conclusions 
Patients with DED often have poor QoL. This may be due to both the physical effects of 
DED, such as ocular discomfort, and decreased visual function. There is a negative effect on 
psychological QoL, which may even lead to depression. In order to assess FVA, visual 
function needs to be assessed dynamically. There are several methods currently available 
for dynamic visual testing, but equipment used for these methods may be too large or 
unaffordable for use in clinical practice. Our hope is that in the future, new, simple and 
affordable instruments will be developed to test dynamic visual function accurately in 
patients with DED and that these methods will also be able to test FVA under simulated 
situations of daily life activities. 
Clinicians and authorities are urged to consider the impact of decreased visual function and 
the impact on their patients’ QoL. The negative effects of DED on visual function may not be 
considered as a typical DED complaint by the general ophthalmologist, and we would 
encourage practitioners to consider testing FVA for every patient with DED with methods 
that are currently available.

Test 
Method description 
Results 
FVA tester8 
Using the Snellen chart, visual acuity 
was measured in patients with DED 
and controls after sustained eye 
opening without blinking for 10–20 s 
(FVA). Oxybuprocaine was applied 
to the eyes to anaesthetise the 
ocular surface in order to minimise 
blinking. 
In patients with DED, FVA 
after sustained eye opening 
decreased significantly 
compared with ordinary 
BCVA, whereas it remained 
at the same level in normal 
controls. 
FVAM system49 
The SSC-350 system is a compact 
device measuring 56 cm in height, 
39.6 cm in width and 26.8 cm in 
depth. Patients are automatically 
presented with a series of Landolt ‘C’ 
rings on a screen at a distance of 
1.1 m and asked to delineate the 
orientation of the rings with a 
joystick. FVA was measured at 10, 
20 and 30 s and compared between 
patients and control subjects. 
Topical anaesthesia was 
administered to minimise blinking.  
Mean FVA scores were 
significantly lower in 
patients with DED than in 
controls at each time point. 
 
FVAM system

The patient views a screen within the 
desktop device on which black 
Landolt optotypes are displayed on a

are displayed at the start of the 
assessment; if the patient response 
is correct, even smaller optotypes 
are presented. If the responses are 
incorrect, larger optotypes are 
presented automatically 
improvements 
in functional, minimal, and 
maximal visual 
acuities, 
IVAD53 
The IVAD test is a computer-based 
measure of BCVA decay between 
blinks. A rotating Landolt ‘C’ is 
presented at the response pace of 
each patient so that the decay in 
visual acuity between blinks can be 
measured. The IVAD test is 
conducted without the use of an 
anaesthetic. 
Normal controls were able 
to maintain their BCVA for 
significantly longer than 
patients with DED, 
p = 0.0001. 
HOAs58 
Serial measurements of ocular and 
corneal HOAs after blinking were 
performed for 10 s using the KR-1 
aberrometer (Topcon, Clichy, 
France). 
In DED, patient-reported 
visual outcomes and clinical 
findings of tear film and 
ocular surface damage 
correlated with the 
progression index for 
corneal HOAs. 
OQAS II 
Visiometrics59 
The OSI is measured with the OQAS 
to assess the amount of light that 
passes through the ocular structures 
and therefore is correlated with 
dynamic vision quality. OSI was 
The OSI was significantly 
higher in the DED study 
group (25 eyes) than in the 
control group (10 eyes).
