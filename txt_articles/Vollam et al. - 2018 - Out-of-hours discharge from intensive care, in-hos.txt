Abstract 
Purpose: Discharge from an intensive care unit (ICU) out of hours is common. We undertook a systematic review and 
meta-analysis to explore the association between time of discharge and mortality/ICU readmission.
Methods: We searched Medline, Embase, Web of Knowledge, CINAHL, the Cochrane Library and OpenGrey to June 
2017. We included studies reporting in-hospital mortality and/or ICU readmission rates by ICU discharge “out-of-hours” 
and “in-hours”. Inclusion was limited to patients aged ≥ 16 years discharged alive from a non-specialist ICU to a lower 
level of hospital care. Studies restricted to specific diseases were excluded. We assessed study quality using the New-
castle Ottowa Scale. We extracted published data, summarising using a random-effects meta-analysis.
Results: Our searches identified 1961 studies. We included unadjusted data from 1,191,178 patients from 18 cohort 
studies (presenting data from 1994 to 2014). “Out of hours” had multiple definitions, beginning between 16:00 and 
22:00 and ending between 05:59 and 09:00. Patients discharged out of hours had higher in-hospital mortality [relative 
risk (95% CI) 1.39 (1.24, 1.57) p < 0.0001] and readmission rates [1·30 (1.19, 1.42), p < 0.001] than patients discharged in 
hours. Heterogeneity was high (I2 90.1% for mortality and 90.2% for readmission), resulting from differences in effect 
size rather than the presence of an effect.
Conclusions: Out-of-hours discharge from an ICU is strongly associated with both in-hospital death and ICU read-
mission. These effects persisted across all definitions of “out of hours” and across healthcare systems in different geo-
graphical locations. Whether these increases in mortality and readmission result from patient differences, differences 
in care, or a combination remains unclear.

Introduction
The days in hospital following discharge from an inten-
sive care unit (ICU) are high risk. In multi-centre 
studies, in-hospital mortality rates after ICU discharge 
are between 4.0 and 13.3% [1, 2], and account for one-
third of all in-hospital deaths in patients treated in an 
ICU. These findings compare unfavourably with in-
hospital mortality in other “high-risk” patient groups, 
cardiothoracic (2.7%) or upper gastrointestinal (2.4%) 
surgery [3, 4]. While in hospital, patients discharged from 
an ICU remain at high risk of requiring re-admission to 
an ICU [5–7]. Readmission to an ICU is associated with

substantially higher mortality rates than a single admis-
sion [1, 5, 8].
Whether out-of-hours discharge from an ICU to a ward 
is associated with these poor outcomes is unclear, with 
studies showing differing results [1, 9–11]. Where an 
association has been found, opinions differ as to whether 
out-of-hours discharge from an ICU results in differences 
in care that cause these outcomes [12–14]. Observed 
outcome differences may also be explained because the 
population discharged out-of-hours differs from that dis-
charged in-hours rather than there being differences in 
care. There are reasons why these differences in popula-
tion might occur. If discharge out-of-hours results from 
bed pressures (more patients requiring admission to the 
ICU than available beds) [12], patients thought unlikely 
to benefit from further ICU support may be discharged 
preferentially. In this case, it would be expected that read-
mission rates in those discharged out-of-hours should be 
lower than in those discharged in-hours. Alternatively, 
if the patients are discharged before the point they no 
longer need ICU care, mortality and readmissions may 
increase.
Some researchers have looked specifically at out-of-
hours discharge as a factor in post-ICU mortality or 
readmission [2, 8, 11, 15], and other cohort studies have 
included the effect of out-of-hours discharge in broader 
studies of mortality and readmission rates [5, 16–18]. To 
the best of our knowledge, a robust systematic review of 
the association of out-of-hours discharge with in-hospi-
tal mortality and ICU readmission, including both types 
of study, has never been undertaken. Synthesis of this 
information is important because out-of-hours discharge 
remains common [19]. If associated with post-ICU mor-
tality or readmission, it is highly amenable to system 
change. If not, discharge at night may be a reasonable 
course to optimally manage ICU occupancy.
Our primary objective was to determine whether dis-
charge from a general medical, surgical or mixed medi-
cal–surgical ICU out-of-hours in comparison to in-hours 
is associated with subsequent in-hospital mortality. Our 
secondary objective was to determine whether out-of-
hours discharge in this population in comparison to 
in-hours discharge is associated with ICU readmission. 
As both ICU provision and practice differs internation-
ally [20], we looked for geographical effects on these 
outcomes.
Methods
Search strategy and selection criteria
We registered this systematic review and meta-analysis 
with PROSPERO (CRD42014010321). We published the 
protocol 
(https

matic

rnal.biome 
dcent 
ral.com/artic 
les/10.1186/s1364 
3-015-0081-8) [21] and 
followed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Sys-
tematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) [22] and MOOSE 
(Meta-analysis Of Observational Studies in Epidemiol-
ogy) guidelines [23] where applicable.
To be included, studies had to: report in-hospital 
mortality and/or ICU readmission rates for all patients 
aged ≥ 16 years discharged alive from a general surgi-
cal, medical or mixed ICU to a lower level of in-hospital 
care (high dependency or ward-level); report these out-
comes separately for patients discharged from ICU out-
of-hours and in-hours; and follow-up patients to hospital 
discharge. We defined “out-of-hours” and “in-hours” as 
separate time periods in each day of the week with “out-
of-hours” including 00:00 and “in-hours” including 12:00. 
We did not change definitions for the weekend period. 
Studies that separated weekday and weekend but did 
not separate in-hours from out-of-hours were excluded. 
We excluded papers where patient episodes included in 
the out-of-hours analysis also contributed to the analy-
sis in a larger study. We also excluded studies restricted 
to specific patient populations (e.g. patients who under-
went cardiac surgery, were managed in a specialist neu-
rosurgical intensive care or received liver transplants). 
We included prospective or retrospective original stud-
ies that used quantitative methods of data collection and 
analysis. All publication languages were included. We 
did not apply date restrictions. We included unpublished 
data, where found.
We performed searches in Medline, Embase, Cumu-
lative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature 
(CINAHL), the Cochrane library and OpenGrey. The 
last search date for all databases was 12 June 2017. 
Reviews or reports of risk factors at ICU discharge may 
not refer to out-of-hours in the title or abstract, par-
ticularly if the effects were not significant. To address 
this, we conducted two searches: a general search for 
all factors associated with post-ICU in-hospital mor-
tality or readmission and a search focused specifi-
cally on out-of-hours discharges. A medical librarian 
(T.P.) guided our search strategy. Details of the search 
strategy are shown in the supplementary material, 
Table 1. We undertook additional keyword and cita-
tion searches from identified studies using Medline 
and Web of Knowledge.
Take‑home message 
Out-of-hours discharge from an ICU is strongly associated with 
both in-hospital death and ICU readmission. These effects persisted 
across all definitions of “out of hours” and across healthcare systems 
in different geographical locations. Whether these increases in mor-
tality and readmission result from patient differences, differences in 
care, or a combination remains unclear.

Data analysis
We exported all search results to a reference manage-
ment software programme (Endnote; Thomson Reu-
ters, www.endno 
te.com), which automatically identified 
duplicates. Two researchers (P.W. and S.V.) reviewed the 
initial results in three stages (title, abstract and full text). 
We resolved disagreements by recourse to the original 
text. From this list, further searches using relevant key-
words (using Medline), and citation searches (using Web 
of Knowledge) for each paper were conducted.
Two researchers (S.V. and P.W.) extracted sum-
mary estimate data (relative risk or odds ratios, where 
reported) independently from each identified study. We 
used data extraction tables that we piloted before use. 
We extracted type of publication (academic paper or 
conference paper), publication date, study type, setting, 
eligibility criteria, proportion and strategy for miss-
ing data, and definitions of in-hours and out-of-hours. 
We extracted data on the numbers of patients included 
in the study, numbers of deaths and readmissions, 
demographic data including illness severity (where 
reported by in-hours and out-of-hours), co-variates 
used in multi-variate analysis and main conclusions 
(see Tables 1, 2 and 3). We extracted additional data 
to determine risk of bias using the Newcastle–Ottawa 
Scale [24]. Where data or details were missing, we con-
tacted the authors by e-mail. 
We compared mortality rates and readmission rates in 
patients discharged from intensive care out-of-hours ver-
sus in-hours. For each study, we calculated risk ratios and 
95% confidence intervals for each of the available out-
comes, mortality and readmission. We summarised data 
using a random-effects meta-analysis (to account for the 
variance we found between studies). We used the Der-
Simonian and Laird method of computing the between-
studies variance [25]. We present results in forest plots 
using the STATA metan procedure [26]. We aggregated 
data at the level of individual studies. We assessed con-
sistency using both the χ2 test and the I2 statistic [27]. 
Where studies adjusted their analysis for potential con-
founders, we summarised odds ratios using the same 
methods.
We pre-specified sensitivity analysis by omitting stud-
ies of different quality or risk of bias. We pre-specified 
subgroup analyses by discharge destination (ward or 
high dependency unit, as defined by the authors), differ-
ent definitions of out-of-hours and inclusion of patients 
receiving palliative care (again as defined by the authors), 
where there were sufficient studies. As ICU practice and 
provision is known to vary geographically [20], we under-
took post hoc analyses of the effect of out-of-hours dis-
charge on mortality and readmission to an ICU by the 
main geographical areas of the published studies (United 
Kingdom, Europe, Australasia, Asia, United States of 
America with South America and Canada).
We used the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (NOS) to assess 
study quality [24]. This tool focuses on three broad areas: 
selection of groups, comparability of groups and ascer-
tainment of outcome. The final output offers a score out 
of nine. We selected discharge destination (ward or high 
dependency unit), age and “admission severity of illness” 
as potential confounders. Two reviewers (S.V. and P.W.) 
separately assessed the studies. We resolved disagree-
ments by discussion or referral to a third reviewer if nec-
essary. We assessed the risk of publication bias by visual 
assessment of funnel plots and Egger’s regression [28]. 
We assessed study heterogeneity using both the χ2 test 
and the I2 statistic [27].
Results
We identified 1961 papers, of which 329 were deemed 
potentially eligible and reviewed at abstract. A total of 
154 full text papers were reviewed following abstract 
screening (Fig. 1). We identified 34 articles eligible for 
inclusion (4 conference abstracts and 30 papers), of 
which 16 were subsequently excluded. Nine studies were 
excluded because they included data also reported in a 
larger study (i.e. large national database studies) [6, 13, 
19, 29–34]. Four studies were deemed ineligible on fur-
ther review. We contacted the authors of three papers: 
two were excluded as we could not obtain patient num-
bers, and one paper contained reporting errors which the 
authors were unable to resolve.
We included 18 studies (14 papers and 4 conference 
abstracts) in the meta-analysis [1, 2, 5, 8–11, 15–18, 
35–41]. The 18 studies (9 multicentre and 9 single centre) 
included 1,191,178 patients. The characteristics of the 
included studies are shown in Table 1. Study size ranged 
from 296 to 263,082 patients. Study duration varied 
between 5 months and 9 years. ICU admission periods 
spanned 1994–2014. Nine papers reported both mortal-
ity and readmission, seven reported mortality only and 
two readmission only.
Definitions of out-of-hours varied, starting between 
16:00 and 22:00 and ending between 05:59 and 09:00. 
Two studies [2, 37] performed more than one analy-
sis using different definitions of out-of-hours. As 13 of 
the other 16 studies defined out-of-hours as commenc-
ing between 18:00 and 22:00, we selected the definition 
starting between these times for inclusion in this analy-
sis (Table 1). All studies presented data for the same time 
periods at the weekend as in the week.
Five of seven studies that compared illness severity 
between in-hours and out-of-hours discharges found 
significantly higher severity of illness at admission in the 
out-of-hours group (Table 2) [1, 2, 8, 10, 35]. Different

measures of illness severity were used, preventing pool-
ing of data. Two of eight studies that compared age 
between in-hours and out-of-hours discharge found sig-
nificant differences (both Australasian studies finding 
patients discharged at night to be slightly younger) [1, 8]. 
None of the five studies that compared gender between 
in-hours and out-of-hours found significant differences. 
The absence of data in many of the included studies, 
combined with the different measures of illness severity 
used prevented post hoc analysis to investigate whether 
differences between in-hours and out-of-hours popula-
tions accounted for differences in outcome.
We included 16 studies containing data on 927,046 
patients in the mortality analysis. Figure 2 shows the 
association between out-of-hours ICU discharge and 
mortality. The pooled relative risk estimate for discharge 
at night (95% CI) was 1.39 (1.24, 1.57), p < 0·0001. Out-of-
hours discharge was associated with significant increases 
in in-hospital mortality for all definitions of out-of-hours 
(supplementary material, Fig. 1). Overall heterogeneity 
was high (I2 statistic 90.1%), mainly arising from differ-
ences in the size (rather than the presence and direction) 
of the effect in studies defining out-of-hours commenc-
ing 18:00–21:59.

The effect of out-of-hours discharge on mortality 
remained for four of the five geographical areas: UK [rel-
ative risk (RR) 1.41 95% CI 1.27, 1.57]; Australasia (RR 
1.65, 95% CI 1.40, 1.94); Europe (RR 1.38, 95% CI 1.08, 
1.76); and United States of America with South America 
and Canada (RR 1.31, 95% CI 1.23, 1.40). Asia included 
only one small study and found no effect (RR 0.41, 95% 
CI 0.10, 1.63) (supplementary material, Fig. 2). Discharge 
out-of-hours remained significantly associated with sub-
sequent in-hospital mortality in six of eight included 
studies that undertook multivariate analysis (Table 3) [1, 
2, 8, 10, 15, 35].
We included 11 studies, including 1,156,904 patients in 
the ICU readmission analysis. Figure 3 shows the asso-
ciation between out-of-hours discharge and readmission 
to an ICU. The pooled risk estimate for discharge out-of-
hours (95% CI) was 1.30 (1.19, 1.42). Heterogeneity was 
high (I2 statistic 90.2%). Heterogeneity arose from differ-
ences in effect size rather than the presence or direction 
of effect [42].
The effect of out-of-hours discharge on readmission 
remained when analysed for studies in Australasia (RR 
1.18, 95% CI 1.09, 1.28), Europe (RR 3.02, 95% CI 2.41, 
3.79) and United States of America with South America 
and Canada (RR 1.14, 95% CI 1.07, 1.21). The effect in the 
UK was borderline (RR 1.42, 95% CI 1.00, 2.02) (supple-
mentary material, Fig. 3).
Table 3 shows studies that adjusted for potential con-
founders. We show the confounders used (for which 
there was no consensus). The summary adjusted odds 
ratio (95% CI) for mortality was 1.33, (1.30, 1.36), 
p < 0.001. For comparison, the unadjusted odds ratio was 
1.33, (1.28, 1.62), p < 0.001. Analysing only studies that 
adjusted for potential confounders reduced heterogene-
ity (the eight studies reporting adjustment tended to be 
larger studies). One study undertook multivariate adjust-
ment for readmission (out-of-hours discharge remained 
significant) [38]. We were unable to perform planned 
sub-group analyses of discharge destination and pal-
liation status due to inconsistent reporting of these data. 
Too few studies in each group meant we were unable to 
perform sub-group analysis of out-of-hours definition.
Funnel plots and Egger’s regressions for the effect of 
out-of-hours discharge on mortality and readmission 
are shown (supplementary material, Figs. 4, 5, 6, 7). Both 
funnel plots and Egger’s regression suggest there may be 
some publication bias whereby studies showing a strong 
association between mortality and out-of-hours dis-
charge, particularly smaller studies, are not published 
(p = 0.014). This was not as obvious for studies of read-
mission (p = 0.057), but this may have been due to a 
smaller sample of studies.

Quality assessment findings are shown in supplemen-
tary material, Table 2. Most studies scored well, between 
seven and nine out of nine. However, only five stud-
ies defined whether the two patient groups were dis-
charged from ICU to a ward or higher dependency area. 
To assess the influence of each study on bias, we omitted 
each study in turn (supplementary material, Figs. 8, 9). 
Removal of any individual study did not remove the effect 
for either mortality or readmission. The largest effect for 
mortality occurred when removing a study including the 
majority of Australasian ICUs [1] reducing the RR (95% 
CI) to 1.36 (1.26, 1.47). For ICU readmission, both fun-
nel and regression plots supported removal of two major 
outliers [9, 38]. Removing the outliers reduced the het-
erogeneity but did not significantly change the RR (sup-
plementary material, Figs. 6, 7, 8, 9).
Discussion
To the best of our knowledge, our meta-analysis brings 
together the available data on the effects of out-of-hours 
discharge from intensive care on subsequent hospital 
mortality and ICU readmission for the first time.
We included 18 studies enrolling 1,191,178 patients. 
We found that out-of-hours discharge is associated with 
around a 41% increase in subsequent in-hospital mortal-
ity and a 30% increased risk of deteriorating to require

readmission to an ICU. The effects persisted across dif-
ferent healthcare systems in different geographical areas 
and across different definitions of out-of-hours.
Strengths and weaknesses
We used a clearly defined, peer-reviewed protocol to 
conduct this review [21] to ensure a rigorous process and 
to minimise concerns regarding internal validity. A major 
strength of our study is that we demonstrate that out-of-
hours discharge is associated with both an increased risk 
of death and an increased risk of readmission.
Our findings are consistent across large numbers of 
patients, different healthcare systems and different defi-
nitions of out-of-hours.
For both mortality and ICU readmission, our meta-
analyses showed substantial heterogeneity. However, 
the heterogeneity mainly lies in how large the effects 
are rather than whether effects are present. Some het-
erogeneity was explained by differences in the definition 
of out-of-hours. Stratifying for different out-of-hours 
definitions decreased heterogeneity in some groups, 
but the association with mortality remained for all 
groups. Heterogeneity was lowest when we summarised 
the adjusted odds ratios for the eight studies report-
ing them. The association with mortality remained pre-
sent. The reported duration of the out-of-hours period 
varied between 9 and 16 h. As a consequence, patients 
discharged at 20:30 are classified as out-of-hours in 12 
studies and in-hours in 5 studies. Although inconsist-
ent, investigators may differ in out-of-hours definitions 
because of differences in what time services change in 
their healthcare system. We chose, along with all the 
included authors, to treat out-of-hours at weekends in 
the same way as weekdays.
Our findings are limited by the cohort design of all the 
included studies. However, in the absence of any con-
trolled studies, they provide the best available evidence. 
The limited data provided by many studies restricted 
our ability to explore underlying causes. Some were not 
primarily focused on the effects of out-of-hours dis-
charges and so did not report population characteristics 
by discharge time. Where disease severity was reported 
by discharge time, studies differed in the assessment 
used. Where reported, most studies excluded patients

discharged to another healthcare facility [5, 9, 11, 17, 
18, 35, 37, 40, 41]. This introduces a potential bias if out-
comes by discharge time differ in this group.
Despite being widely used in published systematic 
reviews, there is disagreement within the literature as to 
the appropriateness of scoring systems to assess study 
quality [43–45]. We used the NOS [24] rather than the 
ACROBAT-NRSI tool [43] proposed in our protocol. We 
selected the NOS as a frequently used and more suitable 
tool for the database cohort studies included. Studies 
commonly failed to define whether patients discharged 
in or out-of-hours were discharged to a ward or to high 
dependency area. This tended to occur in large multi-
site studies where high dependency facilities were not 
reported. As only two (small) studies scored less than 
seven, we did not undertake the planned sub-group anal-
ysis according to study quality.
There remains a risk of other studies not reporting out-
comes related to out-of-hours discharge where no effect 
was seen. However, both the funnel plots and Eggers 
regression for mortality suggest publication bias against 
publishing studies with high out-of-hours discharge mor-
tality rates. This could be explained by a reluctance of 
single centres to publish data associated with a perceived 
poor practice of out-of-hours discharge with high mor-
tality. Our meta-analysis may therefore under- rather 
than over-estimate effects associated with out-of-hours 
discharge. As a result, our findings of increased mortality 
and increased ICU readmission associated with out-of-
hours discharge appear robust.
Comparison to what is previously known
Prior to our meta-analysis, it remained unclear whether 
out-of-hours discharge was associated with increased 
mortality and readmission rates. Many studies that alone 
were not large enough to show a statistically significant 
effect (and could have been misinterpreted as there 
being no effect) contributed to our overall findings [9, 11, 
16–18, 37–41]. One previous meta-analysis of the asso-
ciation between time of discharge from ICU and hos-
pital mortality has been undertaken [46]. However, this 
meta-analysis did not include substantial amounts of 
relevant information, meta-analysing only 14 studies (of 
which we excluded 4 as they contained data duplicated 
within larger studies [19, 29–31] and did not study ICU 
readmission. The absence of registration or a published 
Fig. 3 Forest plot of the association between out-of-hours discharge and ICU readmission
 1127
peer-reviewed protocol may in part explain these 
weaknesses.
Where increased post-ICU mortality or readmis-
sion has been associated with out-of-hours discharge, 
there has been debate as to whether out-of-hours dis-
charge is causally associated with worse outcomes or 
simply defines a patient group who are more at risk [12, 
14]. Differences in disease severity at admission to ICU 
have convincingly been shown not to explain the excess 
mortality and readmission rates found with out-of-hours 
discharge [1, 2, 8, 13, 15, 35]. The presence of treatment 
limitations at ICU admission also did not account for 
the effect [1]. In contrast, two studies [19, 36] corrected 
out an increased risk of out-of-hours discharge found 
on univariate analysis by including steps in their statisti-
cal model that corrected for factors suggestive of differ-
ences in care [continuing therapies such as dialysis and 
parenteral nutrition, decreased conscious state, increased 
therapeutic intervention scores (TISS) scores]. The find-
ings are not contradictory; rather, the question asked 
is different. The first approach suggests that the worse 
outcomes associated with out-of-hours discharge are 
not explained by differences in patients at the point of 
admission to ICU (baseline covariates). The second pro-
vides differences in the care pathway that help explain the 
worse outcomes. It is whether these differences are of sig-
nificance when a patient is discharged out-of-hours that 
is of interest, rather than any concept that crossing the 
threshold of an ICU between particular hours is causally 
associated with mortality. The combination of the find-
ings of both types of study suggest that differences in 
management of patients discharged out-of-hours in part 
explain the worse outcomes seen. Other findings support 
this idea. Goldfrad and colleagues [2] found only 44.1% 
of discharges at night were fully ready for discharge in 
comparison to 86.3% in the day. Premature discharge was 
the main determinant of increased mortality associated 
with night-time discharge in their model. There is also 
evidence that patients with a high treatment need are 
disproportionately discharged at night [13]. Patients dis-
charged out-of-hours also have higher severity of illness 
on their last ICU day [10, 11] and a greater incidence of 
treatments normally delivered in ICUs [19]. All of these 
might suggest that premature discharge in part explains 
our findings. One recent study [19] suggests that prema-
ture discharge is not a factor; however, the incidence of 
documented premature discharge is so low in compari-
son to previous studies [2], and the incidence of delayed 
discharge so high, that the meaning of this is unclear. 
Studies to date differ as to whether including differences 
in the presence of treatment limitations in statistical 
models corrects out the increased risks of out-of-hours 
discharge [1, 11, 15, 19, 36]. It seems unlikely that these 
patients would commonly benefit from readmission to an 
ICU.
Meaning
Our study resolves the question of whether out-of-hours 
discharge is associated with worse outcomes. The asso-
ciation with increased mortality and with readmission 
is substantial. Only the magnitude of the association 
remains somewhat uncertain. The retrospective non-
randomised nature of all the studies undertaken prevents 
the attribution or non-attribution of causation (both for 
the studies and our analysis). Whether these increases 
in mortality and readmission result from patient dif-
ferences, differences in care or a combination remains 
unclear. Our meta-analysis does, however, resolve a key 
area of debate. Disproportionate out-of-hours discharge 
of patients who will no longer benefit from intensive care 
cannot explain the increased mortality, as more of this 
group are readmitted.
Future work
Further work is required to explain why out-of-hours dis-
charge is so strongly associated with post-ICU mortality 
and readmission, and how these adverse outcomes can 
be addressed. Future studies should aim to measure and 
account for confounders appropriately. To investigate 
the question of whether discharge out-of-hours results in 
poor outcomes studies should account for patient factors 
such as age and admission illness severity, which are not 
altered by differences in treatment in or after the ICU. To 
investigate the causes of differences found, studies should 
measure and account for differences in care. These would 
include measures of ICU exposure (length of ICU stay), 
illness severity at the point of discharge and ongoing care 
requirements and quantification of post-discharge care. 
The contribution of post-discharge care to differences in 
out-of-hours outcomes has so far only been explored to a 
limited extent in a single study [19], despite clearly being 
key to further understanding the problem [12].
Conclusion
Out-of-hours discharge from an ICU is associated with 
substantial increases in subsequent in-hospital mortality 
and ICU readmission. These risks remain across different 
healthcare settings, different geographical areas and dif-
ferent definitions of out-of-hours.
