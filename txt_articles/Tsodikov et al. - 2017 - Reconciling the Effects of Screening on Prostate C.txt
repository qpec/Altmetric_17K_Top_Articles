Abstract
Background—The European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) 
found screening reduced prostate cancer (PC) mortality, but the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and 
Ovarian trial (PLCO) found no reduction.
Objective—To evaluate whether effects of screening on PC mortality relative to no screening 
differed between the ERSPC and PLCO.
Design—Cox regression of PC death in each trial arm adjusted for age and trial, and extended 
analyses that accounted for increased incidence due to screening and diagnostic workup on each 
arm via mean lead times (MLTs). MLTs were estimated empirically and using analytic or 
microsimulation models.
Setting—Randomized controlled trials in Europe and the US.
Participants—Men aged 55–69 (ERSPC) or 55–74 (PLCO) at randomization.
Intervention—Prostate cancer screening.
Measurements—PC incidence and survival from randomization; PC incidence in the US before 
screening began.
Results—Estimated MLTs were similar in the ERSPC and PLCO intervention arms but were 
longer in the PLCO control arm than the ERSPC control arm. Extended analyses found no 
evidence that effects of screening differed between trials (P=0.37–0.47, range across MLT 
estimation approaches) but strong evidence that benefit increased with MLT (P=0.0027–0.0032). 
Screening was estimated to confer a 7–9% reduction in PC death per year of MLT. This translated 
into an estimated 25–31% and 27–32% lower risk of PC death under screening as performed in the 
ERSPC and PLCO intervention arms, respectively, relative to no screening.
Limitations—MLT is a simple metric of screening and diagnostic workup.

 Conclusion—After accounting for differences in implementation and settings, the ERSPC and

INTRODUCTION
More than two decades after prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening for prostate cancer 
entered clinical practice, in 2012 the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) 
determined there was “very low probability of preventing a death from prostate cancer in the 
long term” and recommended against routine use of the test (1). Since then, PSA screening 
rates and prostate cancer incidence rates in the United States have declined significantly (2, 
3).
The USPSTF recommendation relied heavily on results from the European Randomized 
Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC; ISRCTN49127736) and the Prostate, Lung, 
Colorectal, and Ovarian cancer screening trial (PLCO; NCT00002540). However, the trials 
produced apparently conflicting results, with the ERSPC reporting a 21% reduction in 
prostate cancer mortality (4–6) and the PLCO finding no mortality difference between the 
trial arms (7–9). Interpreting results of these trials is complicated by differences in their 
implementations, including design and adherence, and practice settings. The PLCO used 
shorter screening intervals (annual screening versus every 2–4 years in the ERSPC), had a 
higher PSA threshold for biopsy referral (4.0 μg/L versus 3.0 μg/L in most ERSPC centers 
and rounds), and stopped regular screening after 6 rounds. Prostate cancer incidence in the 
US was higher than in Europe before the trials started, reflecting different populations and 
clinical diagnosis patterns. The US practice setting also contributed to a higher frequency of 
screening in the control arm and a lower frequency of biopsy compared with the ERSPC. 
Consequently, the PLCO compared effects of an organized screening program relative to 
opportunistic screening rather than effects of screening versus no screening (8–10). 
Nonetheless, the PLCO results have been viewed as more relevant to the US setting (11).
The objectives of this study are to (1) formally test whether the effects of screening on 
prostate cancer mortality differed between the ERSPC and PLCO after accounting for 
differences in implementation and practice settings and (2) to estimate the effects of 
screening in both trials relative to no screening.
METHODS
Overview
Our study used individual records from both trials in a collaboration between trial 
investigators and the Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network (CISNET) 
prostate cancer working group. In the intervention arms, these records included age and year 
of randomization, enrollment center, dates and results of PSA tests and rectal exams, 
whether biopsy was performed, date of cancer diagnosis, and date and cause of death. In the

 control arms, the records included age and year of randomization, enrollment center, date of 
cancer diagnosis, and date and cause of death. For consistency with prior publications, 
ERSPC data included men aged 55–69 years at randomization (12), while PLCO data 
included men aged 55–74 years at randomization (13).
We first examined a traditional statistical analysis that combined data from both trials and 
compared hazards of prostate cancer death in the intervention versus control arms adjusting 
for participant age and trial setting. However, this analysis is questionable due to remaining 
differences in implementation between trials. To overcome this limitation, we also examined 
extended analyses that accounted for variable screening and diagnostic workup (hereafter 
“screening intensity”) in each trial arm, which we operationalized using mean lead times 
(MLTs). The MLTs reflect the magnitude of increased prostate cancer incidence relative to a 
baseline level expected in the absence of screening, thus capturing differences in both design 
and adherence (see below). We estimated the MLTs both empirically and using analytic or 
microsimulation models; using multiple approaches allowed us to assess robustness of 
results to this uncertain quantity.
Estimating mean lead times
The MLT is usually defined as the average time by which diagnosis is advanced by 
screening relative to the date of diagnosis without screening. Under complete follow-up (i.e., 
where all pre-clinical cases are eventually diagnosed in the no-screening setting), the MLT 
corresponds to the difference in areas under two “survival curves” for time from 
randomization to diagnosis: one in the absence of screening minus one in the presence of 
screening. Under limited follow-up, we can define a restricted version of the MLT as an 
analogous difference in areas under survival curves up to a specified time point (14). 
Restricting to the duration of the trial recognizes that events after the trial period cannot 
affect the mortality during the trial. To make estimates between trials comparable, follow-up 
was restricted to 11 years.
Note that our estimates of the MLTs are different from other estimates in the literature that 
can be interpreted as the average time by which screening advances diagnosis among cases 
that would have been clinically diagnosed (15). Our MLTs are designed to represent proxies 
for the intensity of screening and diagnosis, with higher values reflecting higher attendance 
rates at screening exams, more frequent screening exams, less conservative criteria for 
biopsy referral, and/or higher frequencies of biopsy. Thus, accounting for variable MLTs 
across trial arms captures in a single measure important differences in the trial screening 
protocols, participant adherence to those protocols in the intervention arms, and control arm 
screening.
We estimated the MLTs empirically, without any model assumptions about cancer 
progression and diagnosis, and also using three models of cancer natural history and 
diagnosis. The empirical approach estimated the MLTs by calculating the difference 
between “survival curves” for observed time from randomization to diagnosis in each trial 
arm relative to an assumed baseline level. The assumed baseline probability of diagnosis in 
the absence of screening was derived using incidence rates from the Surveillance, 
Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program in 1986, just before PSA screening began

 in the US, adjusted to reflect distributions of age at randomization in each trial. Additionally, 
one (University of Michigan [UMICH]) analytic model and two (Fred Hutchinson Cancer 
Research Center [FHCRC] and Erasmus University Medical Center MIcrosimulation 
SCreening ANalysis [MISCAN]) simulation models estimated times from randomization to 
diagnosis in the absence and presence of screening based on cancer progression and 
diagnosis rates, which were estimated using individual patient attendance, screening, and 
incidence data. The fitted models then estimated MLTs as in the empirical approach but 
using projected instead of observed incidence rates. Each MLT was then scaled by the 
corresponding fraction of individuals diagnosed within the 11-year follow-up period 
projected so that it could be interpreted as an average interval among cancers detected on the 
relevant trial arm. Further details are described in the Supplementary Materials.
Statistical analysis
We used Cox regression to model survival from randomization to prostate cancer death, 
censoring individuals who died of other causes or were alive at last follow-up. We examined 
both a traditional statistical analysis and extended analyses that incorporated the measure of 
screening intensity captured by the estimated MLTs. Both types of analysis included 
participant age at randomization and a trial setting indicator (PLCO versus ERSPC), which 
allowed for a different baseline risk of prostate cancer death in the absence of screening 
between the two trial settings.
Traditional statistical analysis—We first conducted a traditional analysis to test 
whether the effect of screening differed between trials. Specifically, we tested the effect of 
being randomized to the intervention arm (relative to the control arm) on the risk of prostate 
cancer death. The exponential of the coefficient for the trial arm indicator is the hazard ratio 
for prostate cancer death in the intervention arm relative to the control arm; in other words, it 
reflects the effect of screening on prostate cancer mortality in an intent-to-screen analysis. 
We fitted this model with and without allowing separate effects of screening in each trial 
(i.e., with and without interaction between the trial arm and trial indicator), then used a 
likelihood ratio test to evaluate evidence of differential effects of screening between trials.
Extended statistical analysis—Next we replaced the trial arm indicator with the 
corresponding MLT estimated empirically or using a model-based approach. The 
exponential of the coefficient for the MLT represents the hazard ratio for prostate cancer 
death per additional year of MLT; in other words, it reflects screening efficacy standardized 
by screening intensity. As in the traditional analysis, we fitted this model with and without 
allowing separate effects of screening on prostate cancer mortality in each trial (i.e., with 
and without interaction between the MLT and trial indicator), then used a likelihood ratio 
test to evaluate evidence of differential effects of screening between trials.
Our extended analyses are consistent with the analyses in the trial publications (4, 7) with 
two important differences. First, rather than relying on an intent-to-treat effect of screening 
determined by the assigned arm in a single trial, we explicitly included a covariate (MLT) to 
capture the intensity of screening in each arm. This represents a transition from thinking 
about screening as all or nothing, corresponding to an intervention and control arm, to a

 continuous metric of screening intensity, with resulting coefficient estimates interpreted 
relative to a no-screening setting (i.e., a setting where MLT=0). Second, we used combined 
data from both trials in a single analysis, adding an indicator for trial to capture differences 
between trials in baseline cancer-specific survival without screening and an interaction term 
to test whether screening efficacy (per year of MLT) differed between trials.

RESULTS
Table 1 summarizes participants, follow-up, and prostate cancer cases and deaths in the two 
trials using all available follow-up and restricted to 11 years of follow-up. The data under all 
available follow-up differ modestly from published results (5, 8) due to additional cleaning 
and updating. Nonetheless, the cleaned and updated data restricted to 11 years of follow-up 
yielded values similar to published prostate cancer incidence rate ratios (PLCO: 1.12 vs 
1.12; ERSPC: 1.68 vs 1.63) and mortality rate ratios (PLCO: 1.02 vs 1.09; ERSPC: 0.79 vs 
0.79) and preserved the greater effects of screening on prostate cancer incidence and 
mortality rates in the ERSPC relative to the PLCO.
To compare the screening intensity in the intervention and control arms of the two trials, 
Figure 1 illustrates MLTs estimated empirically or using a model-based approach. All 
estimation approaches found similar ordering and relative magnitudes of MLTs across trial 
arms. The ERSPC and PLCO intervention arms had similar MLTs, but the PLCO control 
arm had substantially longer MLTs than the ERSPC control arm, consistent with more 
intensive screening (i.e., greater “contamination”) in the PLCO control arm.
Table 2 reports results of the traditional analysis. A likelihood ratio test associated with this 
analysis modestly suggested different effects of screening on mortality between trials 
(P=0.09). Under a common effect of screening, screening was estimated to reduce the risk of 
prostate cancer death by 16% (95% CI 4–27%; P=0.01) after accounting for different 
baseline risks of prostate cancer death in the PLCO setting relative to the ERSPC setting and 
participant age at randomization. This result essentially corresponds to a weighted average 
of the effect in each trial with the relative sizes of the trials as weights.
Table 2 also presents our extended analyses, which account for the MLT in each trial arm 
estimated empirically or using a model-based approach. The analyses are highly consistent 
and indicate no evidence of different effects of screening on mortality between trials 
(P=0.37–0.47 for interaction, range across estimation approaches). Under a common effect 
of screening, all approaches indicated strong evidence that a longer MLT was associated 
with a lower risk of prostate cancer death after accounting for differential baseline risks of 
prostate cancer death between trial settings and participant age at randomization (P=0.0027–
0.0032). These analyses showed that screening was estimated to confer a 7–9% lower risk of 
prostate cancer death per year of MLT. Using the formula 1–HRMLT, this would translate

 into an estimated 25–31% and 27–32% reduction in the expected risk of prostate cancer 
death in the setting of screening as performed in the ERSPC and PLCO intervention arms, 
respectively, over 11 years of follow-up relative to no screening.
Figure 2 illustrates prostate cancer survival from randomization in each trial arm obtained by 
Kaplan-Meier estimation and predicted under a common effect of screening given MLTs 
estimated by the empirical approach. Predictions obtained using MLTs estimated by the 
model-based approaches (not shown) are similar. The predicted curves closely reproduce 
observed differences in prostate cancer survival between the intervention and control arms in 
both trials, showing that screening intensity as captured by the MLT is highly informative 
about between-arm differences in risks of prostate cancer death in both trials.
DISCUSSION
The USPSTF is currently updating its recommendations about PSA screening, and it has 
looked at the ERSPC and PLCO as the main sources of evidence about screening benefit in 
the past. Primary publications from these high-quality randomized controlled trials are 
irreplaceable for evaluating causal effects of screening for prostate cancer. Yet analyses like 
the one in this article that attempt to overcome limitations of traditional statistical analyses 
critically complement the empirical trial findings, including informing about whether the 
evidence from the trials is compatible and about the expected reduction in prostate cancer 
mortality relative to no screening.
Rather than comparing the trial arms as if they represent screened and non-screened 
populations, this study estimated the intensity of screening in each arm relative to no 
screening. This framework allowed us to formally assess whether screening effects differed 
between the trials when accounting for differential screening intensity between arms in each 
trial. By decoupling screening intensity from trial arm labels and investigating how benefit 
depends on screening intensity, we concluded that differences between the ERSPC and 
PLCO results are largely attributable to differences in screening intensities between arms 
within each trial. Finding no evidence of different effects of screening on prostate cancer 
mortality between trials given the screening intensities, we estimated a common effect of 
screening on mortality using pooled data on 19,226 prostate cancer cases. The pooled 
estimate demonstrates a highly significant benefit of screening. This is the first time that data 
from both trials have been harnessed to estimate screening benefit.
It is possible that this analysis had insufficient power to detect a significant difference in 
screening efficacy between trials. Thus, while there is no evidence of different screening 
efficacies, we cannot unequivocally conclude they were identical. Nevertheless, our 
combined analysis of both trials permits the most powerful examination of this question to 
date.
Our analysis indicates that the baseline risk of prostate cancer death differed between trials. 
This could be due to different incidence, stage distributions, and treatment patterns in the 
trial populations in the absence of screening. A lower-than-expected mortality (relative to 
pre-PSA-era survival) was observed in the PLCO, possibly due to participants being

 healthier or reflecting an era with improved disease-specific survival (16). By quantifying 
screening efficacy as a function of screening intensity, we projected that screening lowered 
the expected risk of prostate cancer mortality in both PLCO arms.
We used multiple approaches to estimate screening intensity. The empirical approach 
reflects catch-all differences in the risk of prostate cancer diagnosis between arms and 
calculates the MLT most consistent with incidence in each arm relative to a common 
baseline level. In contrast, the model-based approaches explicitly account for trial protocols 
and practice setting details that are known or can be quantified, e.g., age distributions, 
enrollment and attendance patterns, and screening and biopsy frequencies within each 
ERSPC center. As expected, the estimates are shorter than in other studies (15) due to the 
different estimation approach and because we restricted to 11 years of follow-up. In general, 
results are highly consistent across estimation approaches and suggest robustness of our 
conclusions to these ways of estimating screening intensity. While quantifying the screening 
intensity through MLT is simple and natural for our problem, other more complicated 
measures are possible. These include various standardized measures derived from an excess 
hazard of cancer diagnosis in a screened population versus an unscreened population, using 
recent methods (17) and earlier literature on relative survival analysis.
The finding that effects of screening on mortality appear to be consistent between trials after 
accounting for differences in implementation and practice setting corroborate other analyses. 
For example, a prior investigation of the PLCO found that control arm screening 
substantially limited the power of that trial to detect a clinically important reduction in 
prostate cancer mortality (18). However, that study did not formally evaluate whether effects 
of screening on prostate cancer mortality differed between the ERSPC and PLCO when 
implementation and setting details are taken into account.
A limitation of this study is that we do not explicitly account for differences between trials 
in characteristics of cancer cases (e.g., clinical stage or Gleason score) or primary 
treatments. Any differences in these factors between trials will be accounted for in the trial-
specific baseline risks of prostate cancer death. Also, the model-based approaches to 
estimate lead times assume that cancers are progressive, although they allow heterogeneity 
in progression risk across individuals. Ultimately, it is impossible to know whether some 
cancers could remain indolent indefinitely or regress spontaneously and permanently. 
However, all estimation approaches closely match incidence trends in each trial arm. We 
also assume that incidence in the absence of screening was constant across calendar years 
before and after the trials began. This too is a simplification. We consider only the mean lead 
time as a surrogate for screening intensity. It is possible that other metrics could have 
different associations with risk of prostate cancer death than we found. Finally, the estimated 
mortality reduction in each trial arm assumes that the risk of death from any cause is small 
during the follow-up period.
In conclusion, taken together, the data from the two screening trials do not provide evidence 
that screening efficacy (relative to no screening) differed between the ERSPC and PLCO 
after accounting for differences in implementation and setting. Our estimation results of the 
common effect of screening suggest that screening can significantly reduce the risk of

weighed against its potential harms for informed clinical and shared decision making.

 Figure 1. Estimated mean lead times (years) in the intervention and control arms of the ERSPC 
and PLCO relative to a hypothetical no-screening setting (where lead time is always zero)
Estimated MLTs are visualized as increasing to the left to suggest the extent to which 
prostate cancer diagnosis is advanced by more intensive screening and diagnostic workup.
