Abstract
Immune checkpoint inhibition with ipilimumab has revolu-
tionized cancer immunotherapy and significantly improved out-
comes of patients with advanced malignant melanoma. Local
peripheral treatments (LPT), such as radiotherapy or electro-
chemotherapy, have been shown to modulate systemic immune
responses, and preliminary data have raised the hypothesis that
the combination of LPT with systemic immune checkpoint block-
ade might be beneficial. Clinical data from 127 consecutively
treated melanoma patients at four cancer centers in Germany and
Switzerland were analyzed. Patients received either ipilimumab
(n ¼ 82) or ipilimumab and additional LPT (n ¼ 45) if indicated
for local tumor control. The addition of LPT to ipilimumab
significantly prolonged overall survival (OS; median OS 93 vs.
42 weeks, unadjusted HR, 0.46; P ¼ 0.0028). Adverse immune-
related events were not increased by the combination treatment,
and LPT-induced local toxicities were in most cases mild. In a
multivariable Cox regression analysis, we show that the effect of
added LPT on OS remained statistically significant after adjusting
for BRAF status, tumor stage, tumor burden, and central nervous
system metastases (adjusted HR, 0.56; 95% confidence interval,
0.31–1.01, P ¼ 0.05). Our data suggest that the addition of LPT
to ipilimumab is safe and effective in patients with metastatic
melanoma irrespective of clinical disease characteristics and
known risk factors. Induction of antitumor immune responses
is most likely the underlying mechanism and warrants prospective
validation. Cancer Immunol Res; 4(9); 744–54. �2016 AACR.
Introduction
The concept of immune checkpoint inhibition has revolution-
ized cancer immunotherapy (1). This progress has been pioneered
by the characterization of the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte–associated-
antigen-4 (CTLA-4) as an immune checkpoint receptor on T cells
and by the development of the antibody to CTLA-4 ipilimumab as
the first-in-class immune checkpoint inhibitor (2, 3). Activation
of CTLA-4 physiologically downmodulates T-cell activation to
limit overshooting immune responses. On the other hand, cancer
cells can escape immune recognition through the upregulation of
CTLA-4 on T cells. In this situation, ipilimumab can activate
immune responses by CTLA-4 inhibition (4).
Two randomized trials demonstrated significant overall surviv-
al (OS) benefits of ipilimumab in advanced melanoma patients
leading to its clinical approval in 2011 (5, 6). Pooled data from
1,861 ipilimumab-treated patients from several clinical trials
showed a median OS of 11.4 months. Interestingly, a survival
plateau was reached after 3 years by 20% to 25% of the patients
that extended through at least 10 years, suggesting that profound
immune responses can control even metastatic melanoma (7).
Intensive research is aiming to increase the rates of long-term
responders and strategies comprise the identification of new
immune checkpoints or the combination of checkpoint blockers.

 For example, inhibition of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis by pembrolizu-
mab has recently demonstrated high efficacy and might be super-
ior to ipilimumab in certain patients (8). Also, the combined
blockade of CTLA-4 and PD-1 signaling resulted in higher efficacy
than anti–CTLA-4 monotherapy. However, this advantage was
accompanied by increased higher-grade toxicities (9). Therefore,
approaches that increase tumor immunogenicity with less sys-
temic toxicity are required.
Here, we examined an alternative strategy, the combination of
local tumor treatments with systemic immune checkpoint block-
ade. Classic radiotherapy has regained the attention of tumor
immunologists because of the so-called "abscopal effect" (AE),
a radiotherapy-induced tumor regression in lesions distant
from the treated site (10, 11). A number of underlying mechan-
isms have been suggested for this clinical observation. First,
radiotherapy can induce an immunogenic type of cancer cell
death associated with antigen release, cytokine production, and
complement activation finally generating an in situ tumor vaccine
(12–14). Second, radiotherapy increases MHC class I expression
and attracts immune cell migration into the tumor micro-
environment (15–17). Third, radiotherapy enhances the diver-
sity of the T-cell receptor repertoire of intratumoral T cells (18).
All these mechanisms can contribute to enhanced systemic
immune responses after local radiotherapy (19, 20).
Potentially
beneficial
interactions
of
radiotherapy
and
immunotherapeutic approaches have been seen in animal
models (18, 21–23) and have been reported in patients with
melanoma or other solid tumors (24–27). In a single-institu-
tion retrospective analysis of melanoma patients treated with
ipilimumab in two different regimens (3 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg),
29 patients concomitantly received local radiotherapy (28). The
combination of ipilimumab and radiotherapy was not associ-
ated with higher than expected toxicity rates. Further clinical
interpretation was limited. More importantly, Victor and col-
leagues reported on nonredundant mechanisms of action of
radiotherapy and dual checkpoint inhibition (anti–CTLA-4
and anti–PD-1) in a prospective phase I pilot trial comprising
22 patients (18).
Based on the available literature, the combination of local
radiotherapy with ipilimumab seems feasible and preclinical data
suggest that this approach could enhance antitumor immune
responses. To test this hypothesis clinically, we performed a
retrospective multicenter analysis of treatment outcomes of
127 consecutively treated melanoma patients who received either
ipilimumab or ipilimumab and local peripheral treatments (LPT)
if clinically indicated for local tumor control.
Materials and Methods
Patients
Clinical data of 127 consecutively ipilimumab-treated patients
with American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage IIIC/IV
(29) malignant melanoma were analyzed at four clinical centers
in Germany (University Hospital Cologne) and Switzerland
(University Hospital Basel, Cantonal Hospital Aarau, St. Claras-
pital Basel). Patients received ipilimumab in line with intended
labeling. The study was approved by institutional review boards.
Additionally, cellular immune responses were prospectively
analyzed in one patient during the treatment course at the Uni-
versity Hospital Cologne after written informed consent and
review board approval (No. 08-144).
Systemic ipilimumab treatment
Ipilimumab (3 mg/kg) was administered intravenously in a
3-week cycle. Therapy was interrupted in case of immune-
related adverse events (irAE) � grade 3 (CTCAE version 4.03).
Local peripheral treatments
Patients received LPT as clinically indicated for palliation of
symptomatic metastases according to local standard protocols. As
we collected data from consecutively treated, advanced-stage
patients, we included all LPT types that were applied during the
data collection time (March 2011 to November 2014) into our
analysis. Radiotherapy of the central nervous system (CNS) was
not defined as a "peripheral" treatment, i.e., LPT, in this study
and analyzed separately. CNS treatments comprised whole-brain
irradiation (WBI) or local (stereotactic) brain irradiation (LBI).
Outcome evaluation
Responses were classified according to response evaluation
criteria in solid tumors (RECIST, version 1.1; ref. 30). Immune-
related response criteria (31) were taken into account when
analyzing overall responses and clinical benefits. Clinical benefit
consisted of complete or partial remission or durable stable
disease. OS was defined as time from ipilimumab initiation to
death of any cause. Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as
the time from ipilimumab initiation to disease progression or
disease-related death, whichever occurred first. Non-event cases
were censored in PFS and OS analyses and defined as patients who
are alive and documented progression free at the last visit.
Measures of immune response
Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratios (NLR) were calculated from
absolute cell numbers of peripheral blood leukocytes, retrospec-
tively, at the time prior to ipilimumab treatment initiation. A
cutoff NLR value of 4, as previously established, was set in order to
separate prognostic groups (32).
The occurrence of abscopal effects (AE) was analyzed retro-
spectively from the patients' records by an independent radiolo-
gist (J. Borggrefe, University of Cologne, Germany) if sufficient
and comparable radiologic data were available at the appropriate
time points.
In addition, we prospectively analyzed cellular immune
responses in 1 patient (a 26-year-old male; ID 6) during the
treatment with ipilimumab and LPT. We set up an in vitro system
in which patient-derived peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMC) were stimulated with lysates of melanoma and nonme-
lanoma cell lines. Blood samples were taken at three time points:
before ipilimumab, after two ipilimumab cycles before LPT, and
after ipilimumab þ LPT. PBMCs were isolated by Ficoll density
gradient centrifugation and cryopreserved until analysis. Total
tumor cell lysates were prepared as described by Thumann and
colleagues (33) from four melanoma cell lines (A375, BLM,
MeWo, and SKmel28) and two control lines (L428, from a
Hodgkin lymphoma, and SW480, a colon carcinoma). Total
protein content was determined with the Pierce 660-nm Protein
Assay (Thermo-Scientific). For the immune assay, PBMCs
were labeled with carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE).
Triplicates of 1.5 � 105 PBMCs/200 mL were stimulated with
10 mg/mL protein of each lysate or tetanus toxoid (TT) as a control
in supplemented RPMI-1640 medium. CD3/28 dynabead (Life
Technologies) stimulated ormedium only cultured PBMCs served

 as furthercontrols. After a 6-dayincubation (37�C, 5% CO2)T-cell
activation and proliferation were determined by flow cytometry
(MACSquant, Miltenyi Biotech) using fluorochrome-conjugat-
ed monoclonal antibodies: CD3-APC (OKT3), CD4-PB (SK3),
CD8-PerCP-Cy5.5
(RPA-T8), CD25-APC-Cy7
(BC96),
and
CD137-PE-Cy7 (4B4-1) (Biolegend).
Statistical analysis
Patients and disease characteristics were analyzed using
descriptive measures and comparison of proportions between
two groups was performed with Fisher exact (two-sided). Nor-
mally distributed data of two groups were compared using the
Student unpaired t test (two-sided). For the analysis of non-
normally distributed data, the Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney test
(two-sided) was applied. Comparisons of more than two groups
were performed with ANOVA. PFS and OS were estimated by the
Kaplan–Meier method and curve comparisons were calculated
using the log-rank test (Graphpad Prism 5 software). Multivar-
iable Cox proportional hazards regression was performed to
evaluate the effect of multiple covariates (i.e., BRAF mutation
status, stage, tumor burden, and CNS metastases) simultaneous-
ly on OS. Predicted OS assuming referent values of all four
covariates was calculated and plotted using MedCalc Statistical
Software version 15.11.4 (MedCalc Software). In all analyses, P
values � 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
Results
Patient characteristics
A total of 127 consecutively ipilimumab-treated patients were
identified at the four study centers between March 2011 and
November 2014. Patient baseline characteristics are summarized
in Table 1. The cohort comprised 69 (54.3%) men and 58
(45.7%) women and the mean age was 61.7 years (range, 23–
89). Most of the patients were diagnosed with AJCC stage IV
disease (n ¼ 113; 89%), and 49 (38.6%) individuals had CNS
metastases at ipilimumab initiation. Activating mutations in
the BRAF gene were detected in 42 (33.1%) patients. BRAF-
targeted therapy was not combined with ipilimumab treatment
because
of
known
increased
toxicity
and
BRAF-mutated
patients received ipilimumab in general as first-line treatment.
Patient data were separated into two groups depending on
whether LPT was administered (LPT group, n ¼ 45) or not
(ipilimumab group, n ¼ 82). In these two groups, distribution
of patient characteristics and clinical risk factors did not show
statistically significant imbalances except of CNS metastasis
treatments, which were significantly overrepresented in the
ipilimumab group (8/45 vs. 41/82; P ¼ 0.00004; Table 2).
Ipilimumab treatment
The majority of all patients (n ¼ 95; 74.8%) received at least
three ipilimumab cycles (Table 1). One patient (University Hos-
pital Basel) was reexposed to ipilimumab after relapse and
received four additional cycles. Median ipilimumab cycle num-
bers were equally distributed between the two study groups (Table
2). A total of 23 (18.1%) patients developed irAEs (CTCAE � 3�)
with balanced occurrence in both treatment groups (Table 2).
Local peripheral treatments
LPT comprised radiotherapy, electrochemotherapy (ECT), or
selective internal radiotherapy (SIRT) and were applied depend-
ing on the metastatic site and treatment availability at the respec-
tive clinical center. Surgical excision was not performed in these
advanced-stage patients. Most of the patients received LPT during
(n ¼ 19; 42.2%) or after (n ¼ 17; 37.8%) ipilimumab therapy and
only 9 patients (20%) had LPT prior to ipilimumab initiation
(Table 1).
In summary, additional LPT was applied to 45 of all 127
patients (35.4%) merely as radiotherapy (n ¼ 40). In 4
cases, LPT consisted of ECT and one patient underwent SIRT.
ECT was applied to skin metastases only. The different LPT
types and treated sites are summarized in Table 3. The
ipilimumab group without additional LPT comprised 82
(64.6%) patients. Both treatment groups included patients
with CNS metastases (LPT group: 8/45 patients; ipilimumab
group: 41/82 patients), which represented a statistically
significant difference (P < 0.001). From those patients with
CNS metastases, 6 of 8 (LPT group) and 40 of 41 (ipilimu-
mab group) received CNS irradiation during the period of
study (Table 2).

 LPT radiation doses were calculated for each treated site
separately. Depending on the treated body site, single con-
ventional radiation doses ranged between 1.8 and 4 Gray (Gy)
and cumulative conventional radiation doses ranged from 20
to 60 Gy (Table 3). In case of stereotactic radiotherapy, single
doses were higher and ranged from 17 to 25 Gy. Some patients
received radiotherapy at different sites consecutively. There-
fore, we also analyzed the "personal cumulative radiation
doses" for each patient. The mean personal radiation dose
was 53.3 Gy for all radiotherapies. Separate analysis of LPT,
CNS, or LPT þ CNS radiotherapy revealed mean personal
cumulative doses of 59.8 Gy, 45.4 Gy, and 67.8 Gy, respec-
tively, which did not represent a statistically significant differ-
ence (Supplementary Fig. S1A).

NOTE: All local treatment types, including CNS radiation as non-LPT, that were applied to the patients during the study period are shown. Each treatment per
body site and patient was analyzed separately. The patient numbers in this table do not sum up to the total count of the study population because some
patients received more than one LPT during the period of analysis. Also, some patients treated with stereotactic CNS radiation received this treatment more than
one time. Local radiotherapy toxicities were assessed according to the CTCAE version 4.03 and affected only the skin or mucosa.

 Local treatment toxicities were mild to moderate in the major-
ity, and noneof the patients developed grade 4 toxicities (Table 3).
Local affections of the skin or local mucosa were the only toxicities
observed.
Outcomes
Median potential follow-up time (from ipilimumab treat-
ment initiation to data lock in November 2014) was calculated
with the reverse survival method (Schemper and Smith 1996)
and resulted in 39 and 87 weeks for the ipilimumab and LPT
group, respectively. During the period of analysis, 42 (51.2%)
patients of the ipilimumab group died versus 19 (42.2%)
patients in the LPT group. Median OS of the entire cohort was
55 weeks. Analysis of the best systemic treatment response
revealed that patients in the LPT group had a significantly
higher rate of clinical benefits as compared with patients in
the ipilimumab group (57.8% vs. 38.8%, P ¼ 0.05). The relative
number of patients who reached a complete or partial remis-
sion was also increased in the LPT group (Table 4). Around
25% of all 127 patients showed long-term responses (OS � 120
weeks; data not shown). Patients who did not receive addi-
tional LPT reached a median OS of 42 weeks. The addition of
LPT significantly prolonged median OS to 93 weeks (HR, 0.46;
95% CI, 0.27–0.73, P ¼ 0.0028; Fig. 1A). The survival benefit
was also statistically significant if patients with CNS metastases
(both treated and untreated) were excluded from the analysis.
In the remaining patients, the addition of LPT led to a median
OS of 117 weeks compared with 46 weeks in patients without
LPT (HR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.17–0.78, P ¼ 0.0116; Fig. 1B).
Because a higher (although not significant) proportion of
M1c patients were treated in the ipilimumab group, we per-
formed OS analysis separately in stage IV M1c patients (includ-
ing CNS metastases). Here, median OS was significantly pro-
longed in the LPT group (68 vs. 31 weeks; HR, 0.55; 95% CI,
0.30–0.97, P ¼ 0.05; Supplementary Fig. S1B). Of the
49 patients with CNS metastases (ipilimumab n ¼ 41; LPT
n ¼ 8), 46 patients received brain-directed radiotherapy during
the time of our analysis. In addition, for these 46 patients,
those treated with LPT had a nonsignificant prolongation of OS
as compared with those treated with ipilimumab alone (82 vs.
34 weeks, HR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.19–0.90, P ¼ 0.06; Fig. 1C).
Patients harboring tumor cell–activating BRAF mutations (n ¼
42) also took advantage from additional LPT. In these patients,
median PFS was significantly prolonged from 11 to 15 weeks (HR,
0.45; 95% CI, 0.19–0.73, P ¼ 0.0138; Fig. 1D). In BRAF wild-type
patients, LPT prolonged median OS from 42 to 88 weeks (HR,
0.45; 95% CI, 0.21–0.79, P ¼ 0.0076) comparable with the entire
patient cohort (Fig. 1E). Patients with a druggable BRAF mutation
received BRAF-targeted treatment usually first at the time of
progression following ipilimumab therapy. In order to distin-
guish immunotherapeutic effects from BRAF-targeted therapy
effects, we analyzed only PFS here.
The impact of timing of LPT administration was analyzed in
three subgroups (before, during, or after ipilimumab). Patients
who received LPT during (n ¼ 19) or prior to ipilimumab
treatment (n ¼ 9) reached a median OS of 117 or 96 weeks,
respectively, versus 86 weeks in patients who had LPT after
ipilimumab treatment (n ¼ 17). This difference was not statisti-
cally significant (P ¼ 0.72; Fig. 1F).
Due to different covariate profiles between the two groups, a
multivariable Cox model was constructed that included BRAF
status (mutated vs. wild-type), AJCC stage (IIIC/IVM1a vs.
IVM1bþc), tumor burden [high vs. low; approximated by the
number of metastatic sites (organs) (low � 2 sites; high > 2 sites)]
and the occurrence of CNS metastases as covariates. LPT
was found to be an independent factor, after adjustment for these
covariates (adjusted HR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.31–1.01, P ¼
0.05; Table 5). A high tumor burden and the diagnosis of CNS
metastases represented significant adverse prognostic factors in
this analysis. Based on the Cox model including the above-
mentioned covariates, the predicted median OS was almost
doubled in the LPT group (Fig. 1G).
Measures of immune responses
Abscopal effects (AE) are defined as treatment responses of
metastatic lesions distant from locally treated sites. In our study
cohort, we identified a total of 40 cases (LPT n ¼ 19; LPT þ CNS
radiotherapy n ¼ 6; CNS radiotherapy n ¼ 15) with radiologic
measures at appropriate time points, enabling us to analyze the
occurrence of AE. Four (21%) out of the 19 LPT cases had AE,
whereas in none of the 6 LPT þ CNS radiotherapy cases were AE
detectable. In contrast, 3 (20%) out of 15 patients who received
CNS radiotherapy without LPT had measurable AE (Table 4).
AE were merely located to pulmonary metastatic sites (not
shown).
Baseline NLR values as prognostic markers for cancer immu-
notherapy could be analyzed from a total of 107 patient
records. The mean baseline NLR [ipilimumab: 4.0 � 0.29

 (SEM); LPT: 4.1 � 0.44 (SEM)] was not different between the
two treatment groups (Fig. 2A) even when patients with CNS
metastases were excluded from this analysis (Fig. 2B). Based on
a NLR cutoff value of 4, patients of each treatment group were
further divided into two subgroups and survival analyses were
performed. Here, patients who had additional LPT reached
longer survival regardless of a high (>4) or low (<4) NLR value
(Fig. 2C and D). However, this difference did not reach statis-
tical significance.
Finally, we also had the chance to prospectively follow
cellular immune responses during ipilimumab and LPT treat-
ment in an exemplary case. The patient, a 26-year-old male
(ID6), was diagnosed with stage IIIA nodular malignant mel-
anoma at the neck in May 2013. Tumorgenetic analysis revealed
BRAF, c-KIT, and NRAS wild-types. The patient progressed to
stage IV, M1b (lung and lymph node metastases) and received
dacarbacine chemotherapy in the setting of a clinical trial. Due
to further progression (stage IV, M1c) with new, asymptomatic
bone metastases, the patient was excluded from the trial and
treatment was changed to ipilimumab (3 mg/kg). After the
second ipilimumab cycle, LPT (radiotherapy ad 56 Gy) was
applied to symptomatic cervical lymph node metastases. Symp-
tomatic inguinal lymph node metastases were irradiated (at
36 Gy) after completion of ipilimumab therapy. Both radio-
therapies were tolerated well. Four ipilimumab cycles were
given without signs of severe immune-related side effects.
Response evaluations demonstrated partial remission under
ipilimumab and further regression over time. At the time of
submission of this article, the patient was still in complete
remission almost 3 years after initial diagnosis.
In order to monitor T-cell responses in this patient, PBMCs
were collected at three different time points during the entire
treatment (Fig. 2E) and stimulated over 6 days with cell lysates
of melanoma and nonmelanoma cell lines as well as antigen-
dependent and -independent controls. Proliferation, measured
by CFSE staining, and CD25 and CD137 expression, as markers
of activation, were the read outs. Prior to ipilimumab, specific
T-cell responses were not detectable. Also following two cycles
of ipilimumab, specific T-cell responses were undetectable. In
contrast, after four cycles of ipilimumab and additional LPT,
the patient's PBMCs contained CD4þ T cells that specifically
responded to melanoma cell lysate stimulation but not to the
control lysates (Fig. 2F and G). Here, proliferated (CFSE low)
and
activated
(CD25þ) CD4þ T
cells
were
significantly
increased (Fig. 2F) as well as CD137-positive CD4þCD25þ T
cells (Fig. 2G). Melanoma-specific T-cell responses were exclu-
sively detectable in CD4þ but not in CD8þ T cells (Supple-
mentary Fig. S1D and S1E). Experimental controls confirmed
general responsiveness (CD3/CD28 stimulation) of the used
cells as well as the ability of the assay to detect antigen-specific
T-cell responses (tetanus toxin stimulation).
Discussion
Immune checkpoint inhibition has significantly improved out-
comes of patients with metastatic melanoma (5, 6). Here, we
present the data of our multicenter retrospective study showing
that the addition of LPT to ipilimumab can significantly further
improve OS of patients with metastatic melanoma. Our data
strongly support the hypothesis of immunologic synergy of these
two treatment modalities.
With regard to the entire cohort, the addition of LPT resulted in
a more than doubled median OS (93 vs. 42 weeks, P ¼ 0.0028). In
BRAF-mutated cases, additional LPT significantly prolonged
median PFS from 11 to 15 weeks (P ¼ 0.0138). The clinical
benefit was consistent even when patients with CNS metastases
were excluded from analysis (median OS 117 vs. 46 weeks, P ¼
0.0116) or if only patients with the most advanced stage (IV M1c)
were analyzed (68 vs. 31 weeks, P ¼ 0.05). Separate analysis of
patients without CNS metastases was important in this study
because the two treatment groups were imbalanced concerning
this risk factor. Besides CNS metastases, other risk factors also
contribute to reduced survival rates in melanoma patients and
could influence the impact of additional LPT. Therefore, we
performed a multivariable Cox regression analysis consisting of
four risk factors as covariates: BRAF mutation status, tumor stage,
tumor burden, and CNS metastases. Here, the addition of LPT to
ipilimumab treatment turned out to be an independent factor for
improved survival. Although this finding needs further prospec-
tive validation, our data suggest that the addition of LPT to
ipilimumab seems effective irrespective of established adverse
prognostic factors.
Our data are consistent with preclinical evidence demonstrat-
ing irradiation-induced immune responses and with the clinical
observation of abscopal effects. In early attempts, the combina-
tion of radiotherapy with immunotherapy agents showed some
activity, where growth factors recruited dendritic cells (DC) to an
irradiated tumor, or direct DC injection into a tumor showed
synergistic effects with irradiation (34–36).
However, in the clinical setting, detection of abscopal effects
is rare. This situation might now change in the new therapeutic
era of immune checkpoint blockade. A number of preclinical
studies and clinical cases have been published which present
further evidence for abscopal effects of LPT and a synergy with
systemic checkpoint inhibition (24, 28, 34, 37–40). For exam-
ple, Postow and colleagues reported that a 33-year-old patient
with metastatic melanoma, who had received ipilimumab

IVM1b and IVM1c (which include distant organ metastases). Tumor burden was approximated by the number of metastatic sites (organs; low � 2 sites; high > 2 sites).

 synergy and had profound systemic responses to therapy (25).
These systemic responses correlated with increasing antibody
titers to the tumor antigen NY-ESO-1 and with enhanced
activation of adoptive immune responses. A retrospective anal-
ysis of 21 melanoma patients who had progressive disease after
ipilimumab treatment, and then received radiotherapy to the
brain (62%) or to peripheral sites (48%), showed an abscopal
response in 11 (52%) patients (41). Other authors have
described abscopal effects induced by the combination of
radiotherapy with GM-CSF (42) and also that CNS radiother-
apy itself can induce peripheral abscopal effects (43).
We therefore sought to analyze the occurrence of abscopal
effects in our cohort. However, our analysis was limited by the
fact that appropriate, comparable radiologic data were only
available in a limited number of cases, which underlines the
importance of prospectively well-defined settings to detect
abscopal effects. Nonetheless, we analyzed the data of a total
of 40 patients who received either LPT or CNS irradiation in
addition to ipilimumab. We found that 20–21% of these
patients had abscopal effects after their treatment. This number
is comparable with published data on abscopal effects during
immune checkpoint inhibition (42, 44), but further conclu-
sions cannot be drawn here due to the limitations mentioned
above.
Since the introduction of ipilimumab into clinical practice,
pooled study data show a survival curve plateau in about 20% of

 the patients (7). In our study, approximately 40% to 45% of
patients who received additional LPT achieved a survival plateau,
compared with about 22% to 25% of the ipilimumab-only-
treated patients. To find supporting data for this difference, we
analyzed clinical benefit rates in the two treatment groups.
Patients in our LPT group had a significantly better clinical benefit
rates with a higher percentage of complete and partial remissions.
Also, the separate analysis of patients without CNS metastases did
not change these results.
Baseline NLR represents an independent prognostic factor for
cancer immunotherapy outcomes, and high values (cutoff 4 or 5)
correlate with worse treatment responses (32, 45). In our study,
we did not find significant differences of baseline NLR values
between the two treatment groups. OS was improved in LPT-
treated patients regardless of high or low baseline NLR values
(cutoff 4). However, this survival benefit was not statistically
significant, most likely due to the low case numbers in each
subgroup.
Various cellular immune responses are involved in cancer
control, and ipilimumab induces melanoma-specific CD4þ
and CD8þ T-cell responses (46–48). In an exemplary patient
who developed long-term disease control, we had an oppor-
tunity to analyze T-cell responses longitudinally during the
course of treatment. Instead of specific peptides, we used
whole tumor cell lysates as T-cell stimuli because the majority
of melanoma-specific tumor antigens remain unknown (49).
In our assay, T-cell activation was most likely not due to the
recognition of the five tested melanoma associated antigens
(HMB45, MelanA, MiTF, S100, or tyrosinase), because T-cell
responses did not mirror the antigen expression patterns of
these proteins in the cell lines and the primary tumor (Sup-
plementary Fig. S1C). We therefore assume that our assay
contained unidentified tumor antigens that were recognized
by in vivo primed T cells. In this patient, activation of CD4þ,
but not CD8þ, T cells was detected at the last time point
measured (following the addition of LPT), but not earlier
(Fig. 2F and G and Supplementary Fig. S1D and S1E). How-
ever, control antigen-specific (tetanus toxin) T-cell responses
were also detected only at this last time point, and we
therefore cannot rule out that delayed general T-cell activa-
tion was the underlying cause for these kinetics. Future
prospective analysis of immune responses during immuno-
therapy and LPT may provide insights into the biological
mechanisms and determine if LPT can enhance tumor-specific
T-cell responses.
irAEs and autoimmunity after ipilimumab treatment correlate
with improved outcomes (50). In our analysis irAE were not
significantly increased in patients who additionally received LPT,
despite their survival benefit. This might further suggest that
additional LPT can activate immune responses more specifically,
which limits the risk of immune-mediated off-tumor tissue
damage.
Timing of LPT administration, which was also analyzed in this
study, did not show statistically significant differences if LPT were
applied prior, during, or after ipilimumab. However, patient
numbers in this subgroup analysis were limited, thus preventing
firm conclusions. From a tumor-immunological perspective,
induction of immunogenic cell death by LPT in an already
activated
immune
system
might
induce
specific
immune
responses more effectively. The results of our immune response
analysis support this view.
Pembrolizumab, another immune checkpoint inhibitor target-
ing PD-1, has demonstrated high efficacy and might be superior to
ipilimumab (8). Therefore, it would be interesting to study if the
impact of additional LPT could also be detected after PD-1/PD-L1
blockade. Patients who acquire resistance to CTLA-4 blockade can
respond to consecutive PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition (18). This
approach could further improve immunotherapy and suggests
that nonredundant functions of immune checkpoints should be
taken into account in future trial designs.
To our knowledge, currently our study represents the largest
analysis focusing on additional LPT in melanoma patients under-
going immune checkpoint blockade. Although the interpretation
of retrospective data is naturally somewhat limited, the combi-
nation of LPT with ipilimumab is feasible and additional LPT can
improve patient outcomes by enhancing antitumor immune
responses. The combined concept of local therapy with systemic
immune checkpoint inhibition is currently being studied in
prospective clinical trials and has the potential to further improve
the success of cancer immunotherapy (51).
