Abstract
Background: Sepsis is a common condition encountered by emergency and critical care physicians, with significant
costs, both economic and human. Myocardial dysfunction in sepsis is a well-recognized but poorly understood
phenomenon. There is an extensive body of literature on this subject, yet results are conflicting and no objective
definition of septic cardiomyopathy exists, representing a critical knowledge gap.
Objectives: In this article, we review the pathophysiology of septic cardiomyopathy, covering the effects of key
inflammatory mediators on both the heart and the peripheral vasculature, highlighting the interconnectedness of
these two systems. We focus on the extant literature on echocardiographic and laboratory assessment of the
heart in sepsis, highlighting gaps therein and suggesting avenues for future research. Implications for treatment
are briefly discussed.
Conclusions: As a result of conflicting data, echocardiographic measures of left ventricular (systolic or diastolic)
or right ventricular function cannot currently provide reliable prognostic information in patients with sepsis.
Natriuretic peptides and cardiac troponins are of similarly unclear utility. Heterogeneous classification of illness,
treatment variability, and lack of formal diagnostic criteria for septic cardiomyopathy contribute to the conflicting
results. Development of formal diagnostic criteria, and use thereof in future studies, may help elucidate the link
between cardiac performance and outcomes in patients with sepsis.

Background
Septic cardiomyopathy (SC) is often diagnosed when
some acute perturbation in cardiac function exists in the
setting of sepsis. At present, no formalized or consensus
definition of SC exists, representing a critical knowledge
gap. Complexity of the cardiovascular system, myriad
methods of assessment, and variations in the pre-septic
state of the heart make elucidation of a cause-and-effect
relationship difficult.
SC has been recognized for 40 years [1, 2] and may be
present in up to 44% of patients [3, 4], but it remains
incompletely understood. While results are varied, some
studies suggest that mortality is two to three times greater
when SC is present [5, 6]. Understanding how the heart
behaves is critical when making treatment decisions for
septic patients. For example, aggressive fluid resuscitation
has been integral in the treatment of sepsis for nearly two
decades, but recent literature suggests that excessive fluid
resuscitation is deleterious in some patients [7, 8]. Varia-
tions in myocardial performance could explain, at least in
part, these observed differences.
Early studies utilized invasive assessment methods or
radionuclide imaging [4, 9]; while providing a plethora

 of data, these techniques are of limited utility to emer-
gency and critical care physicians given that they can-
not be performed at the point-of-care and are difficult
to repeat.
Echocardiography, however, is widely available, non-
invasive, and easily repeatable, making it an optimal
modality for evaluation of SC. Measurement of serum
cardiac biomarkers provides separate, but related, infor-
mation about the state of the heart [10] and thus may be
complementary to echocardiographically derived data.
The purpose of this article is to review the extant
literature on SC, with a focus on the evaluation and
prognostic implications of various echocardiographic
and laboratory measures thereof.
Pathophysiology
The pathophysiologic cascade of sepsis begins when the
host immune system responds to an invading pathogen,
resulting in activation of the innate immune response [11].
This culminates in the generation and release of pro-
inflammatory mediators and signaling molecules that may
be physiologic (beneficial) or pathologic (harmful) to the
host; concomitant release of anti-inflammatory mediators
occurs as well. These molecules, acting through varied sig-
nal transduction pathways, which in some cases alter gene
expression, activate both positive and negative feedback
loops within the immune system [12]. Recent advances in
oxidative
lipidomics
have
identified
products
of
upstream lipid metabolism that are involved in the ini-
tiation (eicosanoids) and recovery phases (lipoxins,
resolvins) [13]. Sepsis-induced dysregulation of the
normal immune response can lead to a variety of dele-
terious effects, including SC, multi-system organ fail-
ure, and ultimately death in some patients [5] .
Septic shock is often classified as a type of “distributive”
shock—relative hypovolemia resulting from maldistribu-
tion of circulating volume due to peripheral vasodilation,
glycocalyx dysfunction, and increased capillary permeabil-
ity. It has also been described as a biphasic disorder with
an early, hyperdynamic phase (high cardiac output (CO),
low systemic vascular resistance (SVR), warm extremities)
and a late, hypodynamic phase (low CO, poor perfusion)
[5, 6]. Circulating inflammatory mediators are believed to
be the causative agents, acting directly on cardiomyocytes
and the peripheral vasculature, which affects myocardial
performance via alterations in SVR and venous return.
While preload augmentation has long been a primary
intervention for sepsis and can increase CO via the Frank-
Starling mechanism, its ability to do so depends on the
functional state of the heart. However, measures of preload,
such as central venous pressure (CVP) and inferior vena
cava (IVC) dimensions, provide limited information on
underlying cardiac function. Even when volume respon-
siveness is suggested by low CVP, increased respiratory
variation of IVC diameter, or other invasive methods, guid-
ance of resuscitation based on these measures has not been
found to improve outcomes [14–16].
Changes in afterload also affect the ability of the heart
to deliver blood to the peripheral tissues. Thus, a heart
with poor intrinsic contractility may be able to increase
CO when SVR is low—thereby giving the impression of
normal function—when in fact systolic performance is
impaired. This dysfunction may only become apparent
when SVR returns to normal via natural (recovery from
sepsis) or artificial means (vasopressor use). Boissier et
al. [17] demonstrated such an
inverse relationship
between ejection fraction and SVR in septic patients.
An early hypothesis, based on animal models, was that
SC was caused by global myocardial ischemia resulting
from decreased coronary blood flow [18]. Subsequent
investigation, including human studies, showed preserved
or increased coronary perfusion in some septic patients
[19]. Derangements in cardiomyocyte physiology are still
believed to play a role, but at the microcirculatory, rather
than the macrocirculatory, level [20]. Inflammatory mole-
cules are thought to be responsible for this via pleiotropic
effects [5]. Damage occurs via changes in endothelial
permeability, leading to edema, increased neutrophil
transduction into the interstitium, fibrin deposition, and
in some cases, activation of the coagulation cascade [21].
Increased oxidative stress may induce mitochondrial
dysfunction and disruption of normal calcium handling
[22]—critical events given the high-energy demands of
cardiac tissue. The exact mechanism that culminates in
cardiac dysfunction is not clear; one theory posits that
myocardial edema leads to disruption or malfunction of
the contractile apparatus [23]. Autonomic dysregulation
leading to decreased expression of adrenergic receptors
and thus resistance to endogenous catecholamines may
also be present [22]. Figure 1 illustrates the complex inter-
actions between host and pathogen factors that contribute
to the development of SC.
Despite such pathology, a cardinal feature of SC is its
apparent reversibility, with many studies reporting that
patients’ cardiac function recovered fully to their pre-
morbid state [1, 5, 20, 24]. Cardiac magnetic resonance
has detected changes suggesting myocardial edema or
an altered metabolic state, a pattern distinct from that
seen with ischemia and necrosis, the former being con-
sistent with reversibility [25]. Thus, some theorize that
SC represents a protective “hibernating” state [26], as
has been demonstrated in subsets of patients with
acute myocardial ischemia [27]. A reversible—and
incompletely understood—takotsubo pattern has also
been described in septic patients. The physiologic
stresses of sepsis are thought to play a role, but its
place within the SC continuum is not clear given the
paucity of extant data [28].

 Echocardiography: diagnosis and prognosis
A summary of the echocardiographic parameters that
have been used in the evaluation of SC, and their limita-
tions, is listed in Table 1. Table 2 summarizes the litera-
ture on echocardiography in SC discussed in the ensuing
sections. According to GRADE guidelines [29], the qual-
ity of evidence on this topic is “low” or “very low”. A
summary of the major limitations within the literature
on septic cardiomyopathy is provided in Table 3.
Left ventricle: systolic function
Ejection fraction
Systolic dysfunction, as measured by left ventricular ejec-
tion fraction (LVEF), was one of the first described parame-
ters to assess for SC. Parker et al., in 1984 [1], reported
that approximately 50% of their patients with septic shock
had reduced LVEF. Counter-intuitively, they found low
mean LVEF amongst survivors compared to non-survivors.
Jardin et al. confirmed these findings [24] and further
reported that LV parameters were unaffected by fluid-
loading in non-survivors. Unfortunately, several follow-up
studies found no difference in LVEF between survivors and
non-survivors of septic shock [30, 31]. Two recent meta-
analyses that included 1247 patients failed to find any
meaningful relationship between LV parameters and mor-
tality in septic shock [32, 33].
Global longitudinal strain
Strain imaging is a novel technique based on regional
myocardial deformation. The most frequently used strain
parameter is global longitudinal strain (GLS), which rep-
resents the mean longitudinal strain value from each
segment of the LV [34].
Most commonly, GLS is calculated using speckle-
tracking echocardiography (STE) [35]. STE is a semi-
automated, post-processing computer algorithm that tracks
user-selected regions of the myocardium (“speckles”) dur-
ing the cardiac cycle. As fibers contract during systole,
speckles move closer together, represented by negative
values. Larger negative values represent greater deform-
ation in systole and thus improved LV function (Fig. 2).
Strain imaging has the ability to detect subtle changes
in LV systolic function prior to decline in LVEF [36]. A
meta-analysis by Kalam et al. found that GLS was a bet-
ter predictor of adverse outcomes, including mortality,
than LVEF patients with heart failure and other cardiac

a The table provides general guidelines for annular velocities and ratios based on the 2016 recommendations for the evaluation of left ventricular diastolic function. Based on these recommendations, there are four
recommended variables and abnormal values for determining diastolic dysfunction: septal e’ < 7 cm/s, lateral e’ < 10 cm/s, average E/e’ ratio > 14, LA volume index > 34 mL/m2, and peak TR velocity > 2.8 m/s. Left
ventricular diastolic function is considered abnormal if more than half of these variables exceed their cutoff values. The 2009 recommendations for the evaluation of left ventricular diastolic function previously
suggested an abnormal septal e’ < 8 cm/s and lateral e’ < 10 cm/s. Existing studies have relied upon a simplified version of the 2009 ASE guidelines for assessing diastolic function (using only e’ and E/e’); while one
study [60] found that measures beyond e’ and E/e’ provided limited additional prognostic information, whether application of the updated guidelines would improve the prognostic utility of diastolic assessment
requires further study

septic shock had more LV dysfunction, as measured by
GLS, than matched controls with sepsis but without
shock. Chang et al. [39] prospectively enrolled 111 ICU
patients with septic shock. LVEF was similar between
in-hospital survivors and non-survivors, but GLS was
significantly better in survivors compared to non-survivors,
with an even greater difference for ICU mortality [39].

greater number of patients had LV dysfunction identified
by STE than LVEF (69 versus 33%), there was no differ-
ence in GLS between survivors and non-survivors at

difference or improvement in GLS between survivors

 and non-survivors at 30 and 90 days. Finally, Zaky et al.
[44] reported similar strain values in survivors and non-
survivors; however, apical segments were excluded from
their strain analysis, making interpretation of these results
somewhat difficult. In terms of feasibility of performing
STE in septic patients, studies have reported exclusion
rates for poor image quality from 1.5–20% [40–43, 45, 46].
De Geer et al. [46] found GLS to be the most reproducible
measure for assessing cardiac function in patients with sep-
tic shock, with intraclass correlation coefficients for inter-
and intraobserver variability of 0.91 (0.74–0.95, p < 0.001),
and 0.89 (0.55–0.97, p = 0.002), respectively.
Other considerations
Systolic function can also be assessed using tissue Doppler
imaging (TDI)-derived velocity of the mitral annulus or by
mitral annular plane systolic excursion (MAPSE). Peak sys-
tolic velocity of the mitral annulus, denoted S′, has been
shown to have prognostic value in a variety of cardiovascu-
lar illnesses [47] and is relatively afterload-independent
[17]. MAPSE is the linear distance the mitral annulus
moves towards the LV apex during systole and has demon-
strated similar utility [48].
The evidence with regard to the utility of these vari-
ables in septic patients is conflicting. Weng et al. [49]
found a linear correlation between S′ and LVEF in septic
shock, and that non-survivors had higher S′ than survi-
vors; Boissier et al. [17] reported similar findings. A
study of septic patients with LVEF > 50% also noted
lower S′ in survivors compared to non-survivors [50].
Conversely, Chang et al. [39] found no association be-
tween S′ and ICU or in-hospital mortality.
Left ventricle: diastolic function
In the absence of infiltrative or restrictive cardiac dis-
ease, diastole is the main determinant of LV compliance
[51]. While initially low in SC, regardless of systolic
function, as diastolic function worsens, left ventricular
end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) can rise. Preload aug-
mentation, via increased left ventricular end-diastolic
volume, can lead to further elevation in LVEDP—Brown
et al. [52] found that diastolic dysfunction (DD) was
more common in patients administered larger volumes
of IVF. Mahjoub et al. [53] reported less increase in
LVEDP in volume-responsive septic patients than in
non-responders, demonstrating the varied effects of
IVF-loading, depending on underlying cardiac function.
A putative explanation of the detrimental effects of DD
in sepsis is that elevated left-sided pressure increases
pressure in the pulmonary circulation, the right heart,
and the peripheral tissues, which leads to increases in
extravascular lung water (EVLW) and tissue edema.
The preferred method for evaluation of diastolic function
is TDI-derived velocity of the mitral annuls during early
diastole (e’), with lower values corresponding to worse
diastolic function [51]. The ratio of the peak trans-mitral

 inflow velocity in early diastole (E) to early diastolic mitral
annular velocity (E/e’) has been found to correlate with left-
atrial pressure—a surrogate for pulmonary capillary wedge
pressure [51]; higher values reflect increased pressure.
Prognostic ability of E/e’ and e’ have been evaluated in
septic patients, with conflicting results. Three studies
reported lower e’ in non-survivors compared to survivors
[54–56]; two others found that elevated E/e’ was an inde-
pendent predictor of in-hospital mortality [56, 57]. A 2015
meta-analysis [58] of 636 patients found a prevalence
of DD of 20–57% and a relative risk of death of 1.82
(1.12–2.97, p = 0.002; I2 = 77%). A 2017 update [59], of
1507 patients, found lower lateral e’ and higher E/e’
amongst non-survivors. Interestingly, Brown et al. [52]
found increased mortality only for patients with low-grade
DD (impaired relaxation with minimally elevated LVEDP);
however, these patients received significantly less fluid
than those with more severe DD—2.6 versus 5.5 l—prior
to the initial echocardiogram and thus they may have been
inadequately resuscitated. While e’ is considered to be
relatively preload independent [51], this latter finding sug-
gests there is a link between fluid loading and derange-
ment in diastolic function. In contrast, several other
studies failed to detect an association between DD and
mortality (early or late—up to 1 year) in severe sepsis and
septic shock [30, 31, 39, 43, 49].

 Lanspa et al. [60] found better feasibility of a simpli-
fied diastolic evaluation compared to the 2009 American
Society for Echocardiography (ASE) guidelines, without
loss of predictive value (see Tables 1 and 2 for further
details).
Right ventricle
Dysfunction of the right ventricle (RV) contributes to
morbidity and mortality in a variety of conditions, includ-
ing heart failure and pulmonary hypertension [61, 62].
Tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) is the
easiest and most reproducible measure of RV function
[63]. Reduced TAPSE has been correlated with in-
creased mortality in critical illness [64] and detected in
septic ICU patients when compared to non-septic ICU
controls [38, 65]. Whether RV dysfunction is a mani-
festation of disease severity—and thus associated with
poor outcomes—or a causative factor of morbidity and
mortality is unknown. Contributors to RV dysfunction
include LV dysfunction, hypoxia, hypercarbia, mechan-
ical ventilation with high positive end-expiratory pres-
sure, atelectasis, and fluid overload [42, 62]. Pulmonary
hypertension induced (or exacerbated by) acute respira-
tory distress syndrome or pulmonary sources of sepsis
can also contribute to RV dysfunction; isolated RV dys-
function may be more common in patients with these
conditions compared to those without.
Reported prevalence of RV dysfunction in sepsis
varies, from 31 to 83% [31, 57]. As with other echocar-
diographic variables, investigation of RV parameters has
produced conflicting results. Traditional parameters of
increased RV size and dysfunction have been associated
with increased mortality in some studies [55, 66], but
not others [31, 39, 54, 57]. A retrospective study of 388
septic ICU patients [67] found isolated RV dysfunction
to be an independent predictor of 1-year mortality; com-
bined RV/LV dysfunction showed no such relationship.
A meta-analysis of 412 patients found no association
between RV function and mortality [32]. Orde et al. [42]
reported that reduced RV free wall strain (by STE)
was associated with 6-month mortality (− 16.0 ± 5.7
versus − 19.3 ± 4.9, p ≤ 0.05); these results are promis-
ing but require validation.
Biomarkers
Abnormal cardiac biomarkers, primarily troponin and
natriuretic peptides (NPs), are another potential indicator
of myocardial dysfunction that provide unique but related
information about the heart [10]. Troponin elevation in the
setting of sepsis may reflect altered cardiomyocyte perme-
ability or necrosis from vascular injury rather than athero-
sclerotic disease [68], but determining whether it is related
to SC or another condition (e.g., renal disease) is difficult.
Contemporary troponin assays (cTnI, cTnT) have
been studied in septic patients, with concentrations
generally rising with increasing disease severity; short-
term non-survivors often have greater elevations than
survivors [10, 69], but the results are not uniform [70].
Vallabhajosysula et al. [71] reported that, in septic ICU
patients, elevated TnT on admission was associated with
higher in-hospital and 1-year mortality compared to
patients whose TnT was not elevated; no such associations
were found for elevated ΔTnT. High-sensitivity troponin
(hsTnT) has also been reported to rise with increasing
severity of sepsis, but with unclear prognostic implica-
tions: Rosjo et al. [70] reported greater hsTnT elevation in
non-survivors, but no independent association with mor-
tality; Masson et al. [72] found that an elevated hsTnT on
day 7 (but not day 1) and a > 20% rise from day 1 to day 2
were associated with increased mortality.
B-type NP (BNP), which is released in response to wall
stress, reflects myocardial loading conditions and provides
indirect functional information—as the heart moves to-
wards the unfavorable portion of the Frank-Starling curve,
wall stress, and BNP, rise [73, 74]. As with BNP, amino-
terminal pro-BNP (NT-proBNP) may be elevated in sepsis,
particularly with increasing disease severity, and is more
likely to be elevated in non-survivors compared to survi-
vors [69, 72–75]. In one study, NT-proBNP was a better
predictor of 90-day mortality than hsTnT [72]. Concomi-
tant study of biomarkers and echocardiographic variables
has not produced reliable results. No associations have
been found between LV systolic function and contempor-
ary troponin assays [31, 44]; one study reported an inverse
relationship between LVEF and hsTnT [54], another
found a weak association between hsTnT and declining
GLS (r = 0.35) [43], and a third found no relationship
[55]. Dilation of the RV and LV DD have been variably
associated, with direct correlations for cTnT, hsTnT,
and NT-proBNP in some studies [54, 55, 76], but not in
others [31]. Sturgess et al. [56] found that E/e’ > 15 was
a better predictor of in-hospital mortality than TnT or
NTproBNP.
Some of this variability may be due to the fact that
cardiac biomarker concentrations above the reference
range are common in sepsis, with prevalence as high
as 84% for cTnT [77], 98% for NT-proBNP [75], and
100% for hsTnT [70]. Existing data are limited by re-
sidual confounding from clinical contributors, includ-
ing
age,
disease
severity,
comorbidities
(including
flow-limiting CAD), and treatment. Pending future
studies, existing information on cardiac biomarkers
can be summarized by noting that abnormalities in
the setting of sepsis are likely, but such abnormalities,
in and of themselves, do not equate to a diagnosis of
SC, nor do they provide clear, independent prognostic
information.

 Implications for treatment
Currently, no treatment recommendations exist that spe-
cifically address the presence of SC. Patients with SC may
be at greater risk for excessive fluid resuscitation and
more likely to require inotropic support, as hypoperfusion
would less likely be corrected by IVF administration alone.
However, data comparing use of vasopressors, ino-
tropes, and other treatments in patients with and with-
out SC are scant and subject to extensive confounding.
Where treatment data are stratified by presence or ab-
sence of SC [31, 44, 52, 78], only two found significant
differences between groups. Brown et al. [52] found that
patients with less severe DD received less IVF than those
with more significant abnormalities (2.6 versus 5.5 l).
Pulido et al. [31] reported higher doses of noradrenaline
(norepinephrine) in patients with LV and RV systolic
dysfunction, but no overall difference in the number of
patients receiving it. Establishment of a standardized, ob-
jective definition of SC and adoption of more uniform
study protocols amongst research groups would improve
understanding of differences in treatment requirements
for patients with SC.
Positive inotropic agents have the same putative benefits
of
vasopressors—increasing
CO,
thereby
improving
oxygen delivery to the peripheral tissues. Recommenda-
tions to titrate therapy to central venous oxygen satur-
ation > 65% are of uncertain utility, as a normal value does
not necessarily indicate adequate resuscitation [79]. Fur-
thermore, excessive β stimulation may be harmful, and
there is some evidence that β-blockade may be beneficial
in some patients [80]. Preliminary trials of levosimendan,
a calcium sensitizer and positive inotrope, reported
reduced mortality [81], but no benefit was found in a sub-
sequent larger study [82].
Conclusions
SC is a multi-factorial process that involves complex inter-
actions between host and pathogen factors, and a full
understanding of the disease process remains elusive.
Prognostic implications of echocardiographic and bio-
marker findings are precluded by conflicting data from
extant literature. Formal diagnostic criteria for SC do not
exist; development of these, and studies based thereon,
should be priorities for future research.
