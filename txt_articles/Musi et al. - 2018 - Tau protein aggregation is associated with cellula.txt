Abstract
Tau protein accumulation is the most common pathology among degenerative brain
diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP),
traumatic brain injury (TBI), and over twenty others. Tau‐containing neurofibrillary
tangle (NFT) accumulation is the closest correlate with cognitive decline and cell loss
(Arriagada, Growdon, Hedley‐Whyte, & Hyman, 1992), yet mechanisms mediating
tau toxicity are poorly understood. NFT formation does not induce apoptosis (de
Calignon, Spires‐Jones, Pitstick, Carlson, & Hyman, 2009), which suggests that sec-
ondary mechanisms are driving toxicity. Transcriptomic analyses of NFT‐containing
neurons microdissected from postmortem AD brain revealed an expression profile
consistent with cellular senescence. This complex stress response induces aberrant
cell cycle activity, adaptations to maintain survival, cellular remodeling, and meta-
bolic dysfunction. Using four AD transgenic mouse models, we found that NFTs, but
not Aβ plaques, display a senescence‐like phenotype. Cdkn2a transcript level, a hall-
mark measure of senescence, directly correlated with brain atrophy and NFT burden
in mice. This relationship extended to postmortem brain tissue from humans with
PSP to indicate a phenomenon common to tau toxicity. Tau transgenic mice with
late‐stage pathology were treated with senolytics to remove senescent cells. Despite
the advanced age and disease progression, MRI brain imaging and histopathological
analyses indicated a reduction in total NFT density, neuron loss, and ventricular
enlargement. Collectively, these findings indicate a strong association between the
presence of NFTs and cellular senescence in the brain, which contributes to neu-
rodegeneration. Given the prevalence of tau protein deposition among neurodegen-
erative diseases, these findings have broad implications for understanding, and
potentially treating, dozens of brain diseases.

INTRODUCTION
The underlying processes driving chronic neurodegeneration in Alz-
heimer’s disease (AD) and related neurodegenerative disorders are
largely unknown, and disease‐modifying treatments remain elusive.
The accumulation of tau protein is the most common pathology
among these diseases making tau an appealing molecular target for
intervention (Orr, Sullivan, & Frost, 2017). Tau‐containing neurofibril-
lary tangles (NFTs) closely track with disease severity in human AD
(Arriagada, Growdon, Hedley‐Whyte, & Hyman, 1992); however,
NFT‐containing neurons are long‐lived and do not induce immediate
cell death (de Calignon, Spires‐Jones, Pitstick, Carlson, & Hyman,
2009). In silico modeling predicts that NFT‐containing neurons may
survive decades (Morsch, Simon, & Coleman, 1999), which suggests
that non‐cell autonomous mechanisms may contribute to NFT‐asso-
ciated toxicity.
The experimental data from various studies indicate that tau
pathology may be associated with cellular senescence. This complex
stress response induces a near permanent cell cycle arrest, adapta-
tions to maintain survival, cellular remodeling, metabolic dysfunction,
and disruption of surrounding tissue due to the secretion of toxic
molecules (Childs et al., 2016). While many of these features have
been described in AD brains and transgenic animal models through-
out the literature (e.g., aberrant cell cycle activity, p16INK4A co‐local-
ization
with
NFTs
(Arendt,
Rodel,
Gartner,
&
Holzer,
1996),
decreased lamin B1, and heterochromatin relaxation (Frost, Bardai, &
Feany, 2016); a role for cellular senescence in AD‐associated neu-
rodegeneration has not been investigated. We hypothesized that tau
accumulation may activate this stress response and thereby initiate a
chronic degenerative process culminating in neuron loss and brain
dysfunction. To test this hypothesis, we examined human brain tis-
sue with NFT pathology and utilized AD transgenic mouse models
that develop tau‐associated pathologies. Also, we employed methods
to genetically reduce NFTs and pharmacologically clear senescent
cells. Our results indicate that NFTs induce cellular senescence in
transgenic mice and postmortem human brain tissue. We also found
that senolytics decreased cortical NFT burden, brain atrophy, and
neuron loss in an advanced age (20 months old) transgenic mouse
model of tau‐associated neurodegeneration.

RESULTS
2.1

NFT‐bearing neurons from postmortem AD
brain tissue displayed a senescence‐like
transcriptomic profile
We queried the publicly available GEO Profiles database (Barrett
et al., 2013) for gene sets specific to NFTs. We evaluated laser cap-
ture‐microdissected cortical neurons containing NFTs from AD brains
(GEO
accession
GDS2795)
and
compared
them
to
adjacent
histopathologically normal neurons for a within‐subject study design
(Dunckley et al., 2006). NFT‐containing neurons upregulated genes
involved
in
cell
survival
and
viability,
inflammation,
cell
cycle
progression and molecular transport and downregulated apoptosis,
necrosis, and cell death pathways (Figure 1a). NFκB, a pro‐survival
master transcriptional regulator of inflammation, was the highest
predicted upstream regulator of the NFT gene expression profile. In
agreement with inflammatory activation, other predicted upstream
regulators included IFNG, TNF, TLR4, IL1B, and CXCL1 (Figure 1b).
Collectively, the molecular pathways identified in the NFT analyses
resembled cellular senescence.

NFTs were associated with a senescence‐
associated transcriptomic profile in tau transgenic
mice
We used the rTg(tauP301L)4510 transgenic mouse line, hereon
referred to as “tauNFT” to investigate a link between NFT formation
and a senescence‐like phenomenon in neurodegeneration. These
mice develop well‐characterized, aggressive, tau pathology in fore-
brain regions concomitant with neurodegeneration and cognitive
deficits (Santacruz et al., 2005; pathology illustrated in Supporting
Information Figure S1). Mice that overexpress wild‐type human tau,
“tauWT,” express the same level of transgenic human tau protein as
tauNFT, but acquire age‐dependent tau pathogenesis at a much
slower rate and are used to identify effects of elevated pre‐patho-
genic tau (Hoover et al., 2010; Supporting Information Figures S1
and S2); age‐matched tauNFT littermate mice without human tau
overexpression serve as wild‐type controls, “CTL”. To determine
whether NFT‐containing neurons in mice induced a gene expression
profile resembling cellular senescence, we assessed hippocampal
gene expression patterns in tauNFT mice before (~2 months old) and
after (~6 months old) NFT formation (GSE56772). Consistent with
NFTs from human AD, mouse NFTs also caused significant activation
scores for IFNG, TNF, and IL‐1B, as well as enrichment in other
senescence‐associated JAK, STAT, CDKN2A, and BCL2 predicted
upstream regulators (Figure 1c) indicating translational relevance for
using tauNFT mice to explore our hypothesis.

Evidence of DNA damage, SASP, and NFκB
activation were associated with NFTs
Senescence‐inducing stressors often inflict DNA damage that drives
production of the SASP (Rodier et al., 2009). TauNFT mouse brains
displayed significantly elevated histone γ‐H2ax, a sensitive marker of
both double‐stranded DNA breaks and cellular senescence (Sedel-
nikova et al., 2004; p = 0.0056; Figure 1d–e). The cell cycle protein
p21, encoded by Cdkn1a, is upregulated in many senescent cell types
and has been associated with DNA damage during neuronal aging
(Jurk et al., 2012). Similarly, elevated expression of the cyclin‐depen-
dent kinase inhibitor 2a, Cdkn2a, is one of the most robust markers
of cellular senescence, and its protein product, p16INK4A, colocalizes
with NFTs in human AD (Arendt et al., 1996). Because anti‐p21 and
anti‐p16INK4A antibodies are notoriously poor in mouse tissue, we
exclusively measured Cdkn1a and Cdkn2a gene expression. TauNFT
brains

 (p = 0.0178, Figure 1f), which was replicated in a separate mouse
cohort (p = 0.0086, Supporting Information Figure S2f). Moreover,
Cdkn2a was expressed at levels 2.7‐ and 2.6‐fold higher in tauNFT
than CTL and tauWT, respectively (p = 0.0303 and p = 0.0352,
respectively; Figure 1g); this effect was replicated in an independent
mouse cohort (p = 0.0016, Supporting Information Figure S2g).
Senescent cells exert chronic tissue degeneration through secre-
tion of toxic SASP (Coppe et al., 2010). Consistent with the tran-
scriptomic profile in human NFT‐bearing neurons and mouse brain
tissue (Figure 1a‐c), SASP genes were found to be upregulated in
tauNFT brains, that is, Il1b was four‐ and twofold higher than CTL
and tauWT, respectively; and Cxcl1 was fourfold higher than both
control genotypes; Tnfa was 13‐ and eightfold higher than CTL and
tauWT, respectively; Tlr4 was threefold higher than both control
genotypes (Figure 2a‐d). Further gene expression analyses allowed
us to define an array specific to tau pathology in tauNFT brains (Sup-
porting Information Figure S2e). NFκB regulates the pro‐survival,
pro‐inflammatory SASP gene expression profile characteristic of cel-
lular senescence (Salminen & Kaarniranta, 2011). Consistent with
NFκB pathway activation and the SASP profile, nuclear‐localized
NFκB p65 was significantly increased in tauNFT brains (Figure 2e‐f).
In all measures, tauWT mice were not significantly different from
CTL. These results suggest that insoluble tau and/or post‐transla-
tional modifications associated with insoluble tau, but not general
tau overexpression, were responsible for the senescence‐associated
profile (i.e., DNA damage, NFκB activation, and upregulated SASP;
Figures 1, 2 and Supporting Information Figure S2).

SA β‐gal activity did not correlate with NFTs
or brain atrophy
In regenerative tissues and in vitro cultures, senescent cells may
exhibit SA β‐gal activity, which is a measure of lysosomal galactosi-
dase activity at pH 6.0 and indicative of altered/expanded lysosomal

 compartments (Severino, Allen, Balin, Balin, & Cristofalo, 2000). The
examination of the gene that codes for the hydrolase enzyme, galac-
tosidase beta (β) 1 (Glb1), revealed that tauNFT mice expressed higher
Glb1 gene expression than controls (Supporting Information Fig-
ure S3). However, staining for β‐gal hydrolase activity at pH 6.0
revealed fewer positive cells than controls. Furthermore, SA β‐gal‐re-
active cells were observed even in very young mice (1 month old)
and the number of SA β‐gal‐reactive cells was positively correlated
with brain mass (R2 = 0.4852, p = 0.0039 Supporting Information
Figure S3). While our results indicate that SA β‐gal reactivity did not
correlate with other senescence markers or brain atrophy, the
observed increase in Glb1 gene expression along with a decrease in
lysosomal activity at pH 6.0, compared to controls, is suggestive of
tau‐associated lysosomal defects, which have been reported by
others (Caballero et al., 2018; Wang, Martinez‐Vicente, et al., 2009).

NFT‐containing brain tissue displayed aberrant
cellular bioenergetics
Mitochondrial dysfunction is obligatory for SASP production and cel-
lular senescence (Correia‐Melo et al., 2016; Hutter et al., 2004). To
examine mitochondrial bioenergetics, we performed high‐resolution
respirometry to yield accurate quantitative measurements of oxidative
phosphorylation in response to specific substrates for complex I,
complex II, fat oxidation, and electron‐transfer system (ETS) capacity.
Across genotypes, we compared cortex, hippocampus, and cerebel-
lum. This allowed for the evaluation of specific differences in oxygen
consumption due to elevated transgenic tau (comparing CTL with
tauwt and tauNFT), pathogenic tau‐specific effects (comparing tauwt to
tauNFT), as well as the interaction among brains regions and tau
expression (e.g., cortex and hippocampus express transgenic tau and
develop NFTs, but cerebellum does not). We found a significant geno-
type main effect for oxygen flux in both cortex and hippocampus,
indicating that global respiratory capacity was impaired in NFT‐con-
taining brain regions (p < 0.0001; Figure 3), an effect primarily driven
by
CI + CII
respiration
coupled
to
ATP
production
(cortex:
p = 0.0034; hippocampus: p = 0.0215; Figure 3g,h, respectively), and
uncoupled or maximum respiratory capacity (cortex: p = 0.0248; hip-
pocampus: p = 0.0261; Figure 3g,h, respectively). These changes were
different between tauNFT and each of the control mouse lines, CTL,
and tauWT mice. Because tauWT and tauNFT mice express comparable
total tau levels, alterations to respiratory capacity cannot be attribu-
ted to tau overexpression. Citrate synthase activity is a surrogate
marker of total mitochondrial content/mass and was similar across
genotypes and brain regions (Figure 3i) suggesting that the defects in
cellular respiration were due to altered mitochondrial quality and not
content/mass. Moreover, tauNFT cerebellum did not show deficits in
cellular respiration or Cdkn2a upregulation (Figure 3j,k), indicating that

 senescence‐associated mitochondrial dysfunction was present only in
brain regions with persistent pathogenic tau expression.

Cdkn2a upregulation occurred with NFT onset
and correlated with NFT density
We pursued multiple genetic approaches to determine whether
senescence was mechanistically linked to NFT density, NFT onset, or
merely protein accumulation. Reducing NFT load in age‐matched ani-
mals is not feasible; once NFTs form, they cannot be therapeutically
eliminated. However, genetically ablating endogenous mouse tau (mi-
crotubule‐associated protein tau, Mapt) reduces NFT pathology and
neurodegeneration in tauNFT mice (tauNFT‐Mapt0/0; Wegmann et al.,
2015). The reduced tau pathology corresponded with 60% lower
Cdkn2a expression (p = 0.0041, Figure 4a), decreased SASP (Sup-
porting Information Figure S4), and decreased brain atrophy (tauNFT‐
Mapt0/0:
0.4058 ± 0.009
vs.
age‐matched
tauNFT‐Maptwt/wt:
0.3451 ± 0.0116; 17.5% difference, p = 0.0143, Figure 4b). TauNFT
mice develop aggressive tauopathy with NFT formation in early life
and show a senescence‐associated transcriptomic profile with NFT
onset (Figure 1c). To detect subtle cellular changes associated with
different stages of age‐associated NFT development and progression,
we focused on tauWT mice between 16 and 28 months old. Cdkn2a
gene expression increased significantly during this age interval, and
at 28 months of age, tauWT Cdkn2a expression was similar to that of
16‐month‐old tauNFT mice (Figure 4c). Concomitantly, at this age,
tauWT mice developed NFTs as visualized by Bielschowsky silver
staining and immunofluorescence analyses (Figure 4d). These results
provide additional evidence for the association between NFT forma-
tion and senescence‐associated Cdkn2a upregulation.

Cdkn2a upregulation was specific to NFT tau
pathology and correlated with brain atrophy
To determine whether Cdkn2a expression was driven specifically by
NFTs,
or
whether
AD‐associated
Aβ
protein
deposition
also
increased Cdkn2a, we utilized 3xTgAD mice that acquire both AD‐as-
sociated pathologies with Aβ deposition and NFT onset at 6 and
18 months of age, respectively (Oddo et al., 2003). In 15‐month‐old
mice with heavy Aβ deposition and phosphorylated tau, but lacking
NFT pathology (Orr, Salinas, Buffenstein, & Oddo, 2014), Cdkn2a
expression was not elevated (Figure 4e). These data indicate that
Cdkn2a expression was neither a response to general protein accu-
mulation, nor to pre‐NFT tau pathology, but instead required the
presence of NFTs. Further, when plotted against brain weight,
Cdkn2a expression was a strong predictor of brain atrophy across
mouse lines (p < 0.0001, R2 = 0.5615; Figure 4f).

CDKN2A was upregulated in NFT‐containing
brains from patients with progressive supranuclear
palsy
Tau pathology is common among >20 brain diseases. To investigate
whether the findings in human AD neurons and transgenic mice
translated to human brains with pure tauopathy (i.e., NFT pathology
without other protein aggregates such as Aβ), we acquired human
brain tissue with histopathologically confirmed progressive supranu-
clear palsy (PSP; Table 1 for patient characteristics). PSP is an age‐
associated tauopathy that clinically manifests as parkinsonism with
additional motor abnormalities and cognitive dysfunction (Orr et al.,
2017) and is neuropathologically defined by the accumulation of

 four‐repeat (4R) tau, NFTs, gliosis, and neurodegeneration (Flament,
Delacourte, Verny, Hauw, & Javoy‐Agid, 1991). Consistent with the
results from transgenic mice, CDKN2A was upregulated in PSP brains
(p = 0.0415, Figure 4g) and expression correlated with NFT deposi-
tion, specifically in the parietal lobe (ANOVA, p = 0.0008; Kendall's
Tau rank correlation, p = 0.059, Figure 4h). Moreover, one individual
with the worst cognitive performance, Mini–Mental State Examina-
tion (MMSE) score of 12, displayed the highest level of CDKN2A
expression, and high molecular weight tau (Figure 4i). Collectively,
these findings led us to conclude that NFTs were directly linked to
senescence‐associated Cdkn2a upregulation, which in turn was a
strong predictor of neurodegeneration and cognitive decline.

Senolytic treatment reduced NFT burden and
neurodegeneration
Senescent cells comprise a small proportion of total cellular makeup
within a tissue (~15%; Herbig, Ferreira, Condel, Carey, & Sedivy,
2006). Nonetheless, genetically (Baker et al., 2011) or pharmacologi-
cally (Zhu et al., 2015) clearing even a small percentage of these cells
improves health span and delays age‐associated diseases (Kirkland
et al., 2017). We used some of the best characterized senolytics to
date, dasatinib and quercetin (DQ), to determine the utility of target-
ing cellular senescence to treat tau‐associated neurodegeneration in
late life. Beginning at 20 months old, tauNFT‐Mapt0/0 and nontrans-
genic Mapt0/0 mice were randomized to receive vehicle or DQ at
biweekly intervals for 3 months. When mice were 23 months old,
brain structure and cerebral blood flow were analyzed with MRI and
postmortem histopathology (Figure 5 and Supporting Information
Figure S5). Consistent with senescent cell removal, intermittent DQ
treatment significantly reduced the number of NFT‐containing corti-
cal neurons (p < 0.0001, 35% reduction; Figure 5a,b). Relative to the
existing neuronal population at this advanced age, gene expression
of the NFT‐associated senescence gene array was reduced by DQ
FIGURE 4
Senescence‐associated Cdkn2a was significantly upregulated in mouse and human brains with neurofibrillary tangles and tracked
with total tangle deposition and brain atrophy. (a) Genetically ablating endogenous mouse tau to significantly reduce neurofibrillary tangle load
resulted in a concomitant 60% reduction in Cdk2na expression (two‐tailed t test: p = 0.0041; n = 3/group) and (b) significant reduction in brain
atrophy (two‐tailed t test, p = 0.0143; n = 3/group). (c) Tracking Cdkn2a expression in tauWT mice revealed a significant age‐dependent
increase (one‐way ANOVA: p = 0.0043; n = 3/group for tauWT and n = 4 tauP301L). In contrast to significantly lower expression than tauNFT
mice at 16 months old (p = 0.0075), Dunnett's multiple comparison test indicated that at 22 months of age, tauWT mouse Cdkn2a expression
was no longer statistically lower than tauNFT mice (p = 0.0577) and by 28–30 months they were are statistically the same (p = 0.999). (d)
Immunofluorescence and Bielschowsky silver staining revealed neurofibrillary tangles in 18‐month‐old tauWT mouse hippocampal CA1 (NeuN,

were compared to tauNFT set at y = 1. 3xTgAD Cdkn2a expression was no different than age‐matched C57BL/6 mice (two‐tailed t test,
p = 0.1081; n = 3 WT, n = 6 3xTgAD; n = 4 tauNFT). Both mouse cohorts expressed significantly less Cdkn2a than tauNFT mice (one‐way

analyses of RNA extracted from brains from control older adult humans (n = 10; ave. age = 85.70 years) and age‐matched progressive

(unpaired t test, p = 0.0415) that (h) positively correlated with neurofibrillary tangle deposition in the parietal lobe (ANOVA, p = 0.0008;

enlargement, an indicator of brain atrophy and hallmark of AD
pathology (Silbert et al., 2003). TauNFT mice recapitulate this pathol-
ogy on a wild‐type (Supporting Information Figure S1) and Mapt0/0
background (p = 0.0007; Figure 5d). The DQ‐dependent reduction in

(compared

Aberrant cerebral blood flow is a functional defect that occurs in
AD and tauNFT mice and is closely associated with cognitive impair-
ment (Wells et al., 2015). In brain tissue with tau pathology, cerebral
blood flow was elevated in tauNFT‐Mapt0/0 vehicle‐treated mice (21%
whole brain, p = 0.045; cortex, 48.7%, p = 0.051, Supporting Infor-
mation Figure S5b,c) and consistent with previous reports of tauNFT
mice on a Mapt+/+ background (Wells et al., 2015). DQ improved
aberrant cerebral blood flow in tauNFT‐Mapt0/0 mice such that cere-
bral blood flow was no longer statistically different from controls
(Supporting Information Figure S5b,c). Overall, a composite analysis
of DQ treatment in tauNFT mice revealed a significant global benefit
on cerebral blood flow and neurodegeneration (p = 0.0138; Support-
ing Information Figure S5d).

 To elucidate whether the DQ‐dependent reduction in NFT bur-
den, SASP expression, and improvements to brain structure and
cerebral blood flow conferred neuroprotection, we measured levels
of cell type‐specific protein expression in the brain. DQ‐treated mice
expressed significantly higher levels of neuronal proteins (NeuN:
25%, synaptophysin: 40.8%; PSD95: 38.5%; p < 0.05; Figure 5f–i).
The astrocyte protein GFAP was unchanged, while microglia Iba1
expression was elevated (Iba1: 40%, p = 0.0013; Supporting Informa-
tion Figure S6b–d) suggesting that DQ‐mediated neuroprotection
and decreased SASP were not derived from a reduction in pro‐in-
flammatory glia (astrocytes or microglia) but instead associated with
fewer NFT‐containing neurons. Moreover, DQ did not alter total
human tau protein levels indicating the effects were not driven by
changes in tau protein expression, but rather insoluble NFTs or asso-
ciated post‐translational modifications (Supporting Information Fig-
ure S7). Collectively, our data suggest that cyclic senescent cell
removal of NFTs with DQ produced long‐lasting global effects on
brain, as evidenced by histopathology and MRI analyses.

DISCUSSION
The inability to effectively treat tau‐associated diseases arises, in
part, from a limited understanding of processes driving neurodegen-
eration during the prodromal period. We have identified cellular
senescence, the quintessence of latent tissue degeneration, as a cel-
lular mechanism upregulated in tau‐associated neurodegeneration.
Findings in NFT‐developing transgenic mice, postmortem human AD,
and PSP brain tissue support this concept.
Cellular senescence is an elaborate stress response that varies
across tissues and even among cell types within tissues. Our experi-
mental data provide an initial report of features consistent with cel-
lular senescence in the brain (i.e., transcriptomics, upregulated
Cdkn1a and Cdkn2a, SASP molecules, and altered cellular bioenerget-
ics). A complete depiction of tau‐associated cellular senescence will
require several follow‐up studies guided by these results and a close
evaluation of already published data. For example, aberrant HMGB1
(Nilson et al., 2017), loss of lamin B and heterochromatin relaxation
(Frost et al., 2016), and altered cellular morphology (Orr, Pitstick,
Canine, Ashe, & Carlson, 2012) are all associated with tau pathology,
and consistent with cellular senescence.
Tau processing is complex and requires tight regulation to main-
tain neuronal viability. Alterations to tau splice variant expression,
post‐translational modifications (e.g., phosphorylation, acetylation,
glycosylation, conformational changes, oligomerization, and cleavage),
subcellular localization, etc. may result in neuronal dysfunction. As
such, pathogenic tau is observed in a spectrum of neurodegenerative
diseases where its histopathological characterization aids in clinical
diagnoses. Our experimental results have revealed a strong associa-
tion between NFT pathology and a senescence‐like phenotype.
However, we cannot exclude the possibility that other tau species
and/or specific post‐translational modifications may also contribute
to cellular senescence. The upstream mediators driving tau‐associ-
ated cellular senescence in AD and PSP also remain unknown;
however, it is tempting to speculate that tau‐induced cell cycle re‐
entry may be involved (Arendt, 2012). Aberrant cell cycle re‐entry
causes neuronal apoptosis and AD‐associated pathology (Park, Hal-
lows, Chakrabarty, Davies, & Vincent, 2007) and requires soluble tau
(Seward et al., 2013). The observed increase in NFT‐associated
Cdkn1a and Cdkn2a gene expression may allow stressed neurons to
abort cell cycle re‐entry and enter a cellular state similar to cellular
senescence. In this way, NFTs formed in early pathogenic stages due
to acute stress may initially protect neurons from cell death, but
then contribute to neurodegeneration later in life through senes-
cence‐like mechanisms by altering the bioenergetic state of the brain
and upregulating the toxic SASP.
Pathogenic tau induces a traditional neuroinflammatory response
by activating microglia and astrocytes (for recent review Laurent,
Buee, & Blum, 2018). Our data suggest that NFT‐containing neurons
may
be
active
participants
in
perpetuating
the
inflammatory
response as well. Future studies are required to better understand
the contribution of SASP to the overall neuroinflammation pheno-
type common among many brain diseases. Nonetheless, our findings
suggest that therapeutically targeting cellular senescence effectively
interrupted a chronic neurodegenerative cascade to decrease NFT‐
associated pathology and improve brain structure and aberrant cere-
bral blood flow even in the presence of established tau pathology in
a late‐life advanced disease state. Overall, our data provide evidence
that cellular senescence may be an underlying pathogenic process
common among tauopathies, which opens a new field of investiga-
tive research and offers a potential druggable target to treat the
>20 tau‐associated neurodegenerative diseases.

METHODS
4.1
|
Mice
All animal experiments were carried out following National Institutes
of Health and University of Texas Health Science Center at San
Antonio (UTHSCSA) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
guidelines. We used 16‐ to 32‐month‐old male and female rTg4510
and rTg21221 mice that reversibly express P301L mutant human tau
or wild‐type human tau 4R02, respectively, on either a wild‐type or
Mapt knockout Bl6/FVB genetic background (Hoover et al., 2010;
Santacruz et al., 2005; Wegmann et al., 2015). Nontransgene
expressing littermates from rTg4510 and rTg21221 are used as con-
trols; since no differences were found between these control lines,
only littermates from rTg4510 are used here (Supporting Information
Figure S1f–i). The mice were bred by Rose Pitstick and George A.
Carlson at McLaughlin Research Institute, Great Falls, MT. Mouse
euthanasia, brain dissection, and preparation were performed as pre-
viously described (Orr et al., 2012, 2014 ).
4.2

Ingenuity pathway analyses
The GEO accessions GDS2795 and GSE56772 were accessed from
the GEO Profiles database (Barrett et al., 2013; Dunckley et al.,
8 of 13 |
MUSI ET AL.
 2006) with Rstudio version 1.0.143. Because the GDS2795 data set
was a within‐subject design, ratios of NFT vs. CTL gene expression
were generated for each subject. Mean ratios of each gene from
GDS2795 and fold change values from GSE56772 were uploaded
into Ingenuity Pathway Analyses (IPA) software (IPA, QIAGEN Inc.,
https://www.qiagenbioinformatics.com/products/ingenuity-pathway-
analysis). For GDS2795, GenBank Accession IDs were used and
34,910 out of 54,675 genes were identified by IPA software. The
expression fold change cutoff value was set at 3 (both down‐ and
upregulated)
compressing
the
analyses
to
3,048
genes.
For
GSE56772, LIMMA package was used to determine the fold change
and p‐values. The p‐value cutoff for IPA analysis was set at p < 0.01
yielding 1,294 transcripts, 738 down‐ and 556 upregulated. We uti-
lized IPA causal analytic tools (Kramer, Green, Pollard, & Tugendre-
ich, 2014) to elucidate predicted upstream regulators, as well as
disease and biological functions with significant z‐scores enriched in
our data set.
Findings from GDS2795 were replicated with more stringent cri-
teria (p < 0.05 for NFT/CTL ratios with no fold change limit) allowing
for 1715 genes to be uploaded into IPA with similar results. Simi-
larly, these findings were replicated a third time using the LIMMA
package, the most common method for microarray analysis. This
method did not take into account within‐subject design. Using a
p < 0.05, 1,219 differentially regulated genes were uploaded for IPA
analyses; the results were similar to the original findings. Further-
more, results from GSE56772 were replicated using gene set enrich-
ment analysis (GSEA) with default setting and similar results were
obtained.

RNA extraction and qPCR
Frozen forebrain and cerebellum were powdered in liquid nitrogen.
RNA was extracted from ~25 mg of each respective brain (or brain
region) using the RNAqueous 4PCR® kit (Ambion), following the man-
ufacturer protocol including the 15‐min DNase treatment. qPCR was
performed on 25 ng RNA using the TaqMan® RNA‐to‐CT™ 1‐step kit.
All gene expression analyses were made using TaqMan gene expres-
sion assays. RNA polymerase II subunit J (Polr2j) expression was used
as an internal control for both mouse and human gene expression
assays, Mm00448649_m1 and Hs01558819_m1, respectively. Taq-
Man genes expression identifiers for target genes are as follows:
mouse and human Cdkn2a: Mm00494449_m1 and Hs00923894_m1,
respectively; other mouse genes: Cdkn1a: Mm00432448_m1; Glb1:
Mm01259108_m1; Cxcl1: Mm04207460_m1; Tlr4: Rn00569848_m1;
Il1β: Mm00434228_m1; and TNF: Mm00443258_m1. The senescent
cell population comprises a small proportion of all cells in a tissue;
therefore, SASP gene expression values were normalized to neuronal
Mapt, Mm00521988_m1; Mm00521992_m1 the senescence‐suscep-
tible neuronal population. qPCR was performed using the Applied
Biosystems 7900HT Sequence Detection System, with SDS software
version 2.3. Cycle profile was performed using the kit manufacturer
protocol.
4.4

Protein extraction and capillary
electrophoresis
Approximately 50 mg frozen forebrain was used for subcellular frac-
tionation and capillary electrophoresis as previously described (Orr
et al., 2014; Orr, Garbarino, Salinas, & Buffenstein, 2015). Briefly,
frozen tissue was powdered in liquid nitrogen and then homogenized
with dounce and pestle and fractionated following manufacturer pro-
tocol (Subcellular Protein Fractionation Kit, Thermo Fisher Scientific).
Protein concentrations were determined with BCA (Bio‐Rad); 2 µg
protein was used for capillary electrophoresis. Antibodies were
diluted in Wes Antibody Diluent to the final working concentrations:
p65, 1:50 (Cell Signaling, D14E12; Beverly, MA); phospho‐Ser139
H2A.X, 1:50 (Cell Signaling, 20E3); HT7, 1:1,000 (Pierce/Invitrogen);
NeuN, 1:50 (Millipore, MAB377; Temecula, CA, USA): GFAP 1:200
(Cell Signaling, D1F4Q); synaptophysin, 1:50 (Cell Signaling, D35E4);
see Supporting Information Table S1 for complete antibody informa-
tion. Protein quantification was performed by normalizing to total
protein concentration (Li & Shen, 2013; Moritz, 2017; Supporting
Information Figure S8).

Histology
Brains were fixed in 4% PFA for 48 hr and transferred to PBS con-
taining 0.02% sodium azide and vibratome sectioned at 30 µm. Sec-
tions were washed 3× with TBS (pH 7.4) and incubated in 50%
ethanol for 5 min, followed by 70% ethanol for 5 min. The sections
were then submerged in 0.7% sudan black b dissolved in 70% etha-
nol for 5 min to quench lipofuscin‐like autofluorescence. Tissues
were then rinsed three times for 1–2 min in 50% ethanol. Following
this step, tissue sections were transferred from 50% ethanol to TBS
and proceeded to immunofluorescence staining as described previ-
ously (Orr et al., 2015, 2014 ). Primary antibodies used are as fol-
lows: PHF1 (1:100, kind gift from Dr. Peter Davies), NeuN (1:500
Cell Signaling, D3S31), and histone 3 (1:400, Cell Signaling, D1H2;
Supporting Information Table S1). Secondary antibodies are as fol-
lows: Goat anti‐Mouse IgG (H + L), Alexa Fluor 594 and Goat anti‐
Rabbit IgG (H + L), and Alexa Fluor 488 (1:1,500, Thermo Fisher Sci-
entific). Imaging was performed using a Zeiss LSM 780 confocal
microscope, with ZEN 2.3 software.
4.6
|
Confocal image analyses
Image analyses were conducted using ImageJ’s FIJI. Analyses were
performed on confocal z‐stacks imaged at 40x magnification. A maxi-
mum intensity image was created by compressing four z‐stack
planes. All analyzed DAPI fields were applied a bandpass filter under
the same conditions, applied a threshold, and measured using parti-
cle analysis excluding particles smaller than 25 µm2. All particles
measured in the analysis were checked for mislabels, and any parti-
cles that included two nuclei or exhibited abnormal/incorrect selec-
tion were excluded from analysis. Cell type was identified using
MUSI ET AL.

SA β‐gal staining
Following euthanasia, brains were immediately removed and fresh‐
frozen in an isopentane/liquid nitrogen slurry. The frozen brains were
immediately adhered to the cryotome chuck with optimal cutting
temperature compound (OCT) precooled to −18°C; 10‐µm coronal
sections were collected and mounted on superfrost plus microscope
slides (Fisher Scientific). After sectioning, slides were fixed for 10 min
in 2% paraformaldehyde/0.2% glutaraldehyde at room temperature,
rinsed 3× in TBS, and stained with SA β‐gal staining solution over-
night (Dimri et al., 1995). Following SA β‐gal staining, sections were
processed for immunofluorescence as described above.
4.8
|
Brightfield/SA β‐gal counts
SA β‐gal brightfield images were taken on a Nikon Eclipse Ci‐L
microscope, with a digital site DS‐U2 camera (NIS‐Elements software
BR 4.51.00). Coronally sectioned mouse brains (10 µm) were evalu-
ated using DAPI; SA β‐gal‐positive and SA β‐gal‐negative cells in the
CA2 region of the hippocampus were counted across eight tissue
sections per animal (n = 5 per genotype). Staining was considered
positive when granules of blue stain were present.
4.9
|
High‐resolution respirometry
HRR was conducted using two Oxygraph‐2k (models D and G)
machines from Oroboros Instruments (Austria). To minimize mito-
chondrial damage associated with mitochondrial isolation techniques,
we measured oxygen consumption in fresh brain tissue homogenates
(Makrecka‐Kuka, Krumschnabel, & Gnaiger, 2015). Whole hippocam-
pus, cortex, and cerebellum were homogenized with ~15 strokes
using a Kontes glass homogenizer in 5% w/v ice cold MiRO6. Two
milligram of brain homogenate was loaded into the chamber, and
experiments were carried out when oxygen concentration in each
well was saturated under atmospheric conditions (~190 nM/ml O2).
All reagents and SUIT protocol were described previously (Pesta
et al., 2011) with small modifications. Briefly, 1.25 mM ADP was suf-
ficient for saturation in brain homogenate, rotenone was added at a
concentration of 1 µM, and FCCP was added in a single injection at
a concentration of 0.5 µM.
4.10
|
DQ administration
Control and tauNFT‐Mapt0/0 mice aged 19–20 months were random-
ized to receive DQ senolytic (5 mg/kg dasatinib [LC Laboratories,
Woburn, MA] with 50 mg/kg quercetin [Sigma‐Aldrich]) or vehicle
(60% Phosal 50 PG, 30% PEG 400%, and 10% ethanol) via oral gav-
age as described previously (Ogrodnik et al., 2017). Mice were
weighed and fasted for 2 hr prior to treatment. One month after the
first treatment, senolytic or vehicle gavage continued on a biweekly
basis for a total of six treatment sessions over 12 weeks. Within
2 weeks of the final treatment, all mice underwent MRI analyses.
4.11
|
MRI
MRI experiments were performed on an 11.7 Tesla scanner (BioS-
pec, Bruker, Billerica, MA). A surface coil was used for brain imaging
and a heart coil (Muir, Shen, & Duong, 2008) for arterial spin label-
ing. Coil‐to‐coil electromagnetic interaction was actively decoupled.
Mice were maintained on 1.5% isoflurane anesthesia for MRI dura-
tion. Anatomical MRI: Anatomical images were obtained using a fast
spin‐echo sequence with a matrix = 128 x 128, field of view (FOV) =
1.28cm × 1.28 cm, repetition time (TR) = 4,000 ms, and effective
echo times = 25 ms. Thirty 1‐mm coronal images were acquired with
four averages. Total scan time is equal to 8.5 min. Cerebral blood flow
(CBF) was measured using continuous arterial spin labeling technique
with single shot, spin‐echo, echo‐planar imaging and analyzed as pre-
viously described (Shen, Huang, & Duong, 2015). The images were
acquired with partial Fourier (3/4) acquisition, matrix size = 64 × 64,
FOV = 1.28 cm x 1.28 cm, TR = 3,000 ms, TE = 10.59 ms, and post-
labeling delay = 350 ms. Seven 1‐mm coronal images were acquired
with 100 repetitions. Total scan time is equal to 10 min. Analyses:
MRI analysis was conducted using Stimulate (Center for Magnetic
Resonance Research, University of Minnesota Medical School, Min-
neapolis, MN) running on a CentOS5 Linux Operating System
(Strupp, 1996). Anatomical MRI images were used to measure cor-
tex, subcortex, ventricle, and whole brain volume. The desired
regions of interest (ROIs) were outlined, and volumes were obtained
by multiplying ROI total voxels by voxel volume (0.004 mm3). Ven-
tricular volume was obtained by thresholding anatomical image vox-
els to highlight regions of greater intensity, followed by ROI traces
of the target regions. Whole brain volume was obtained by ROI
trace after removal of the skull using a local Gaussian distribution
3D segmentation MATLAB code (Wang, Li, Sun, Xia, & Kao, 2009).

Transgenic mouse analyses
Measurements were taken from distinct samples. Key finding was
repeated in separate mouse cohorts and is listed in Extended Data
Figures. Each age cohort for all analyses contained three to nine ani-
mals (specified in figure legends); both males and females were
included. Only females were included in DQ treatment and MRI
analyses due to animal availability. Statistics were not used to prede-
termine sample sizes, but instead was determined empirically from
previous experimental experience with similar assays and/or from
sizes generally employed in
the field.
Data are expressed as
mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Genotype and treatment
comparisons were analyzed using one‐way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) with Tukey’s post hoc or unpaired t test unless stated
otherwise in the figure legends. Respirometric data, brain volume,
and cerebral blood flow data were analyzed using two‐way ANOVAs

 (genotype × respirometric parameter) and (treatment × brain region),
respectively, with Tukey’s post hoc comparisons.
4.12.2
|
Human PSP brain tissue analyses
The PSP group contained 14 samples and was compared to 10 age‐
matched controls with both sexes included; the significance was
determined with unpaired two‐tailed t test. We performed ANOVA
analysis of the log base 10 transformed CDKN2A expression as pre-
dicted by the levels of AD pathology; in addition, we used the more
conservative Kendall’s Tau rank correlation to test this association
as well. The human CDKN2A and AD pathology analyses were per-
formed using the R v3+ (Vienna, Austria) environment for statistical
computing using an accountable data analysis process. All other data
were analyzed using GraphPad Prism version 7.0c for Mac OS X,
GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, www.graphpad.com/. Data were
considered statistically different at p < 0.05.
