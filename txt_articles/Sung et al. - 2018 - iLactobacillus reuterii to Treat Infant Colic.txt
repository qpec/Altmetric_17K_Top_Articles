CONTEXT: Lactobacillus reuteri DSM17938 has shown promise in managing colic, but conflicting 
study results have prevented a consensus on whether it is truly effective.
OBJECTIVE: Through an individual participant data meta-analysis, we sought to definitively 
determine if L reuteri DSM17938 effectively reduces crying and/or fussing time in infants 
with colic and whether effects vary by feeding type.
DATA SOURCES: We searched online databases (PubMed, Medline, Embase, the Cumulative Index 
to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, and 
Cochrane), e-abstracts, and clinical trial registries.
STUDY SELECTION: These were double-blind randomized controlled trials (published by June 
2017) of L reuteri DSM17398 versus a placebo, delivered orally to infants with colic, with 
outcomes of infant crying and/or fussing duration and treatment success at 21 days.
DATA EXTRACTION: We collected individual participant raw data from included studies modeled 
simultaneously in multilevel generalized linear mixed-effects regression models.
RESULTS: Four double-blind trials involving 345 infants with colic (174 probiotic and 171 
placebo) were included. The probiotic group averaged less crying and/or fussing time 
than the placebo group at all time points (day 21 adjusted mean difference in change from 
baseline [minutes] −25.4 [95% confidence interval (CI): −47.3 to −3.5]). The probiotic group 
was almost twice as likely as the placebo group to experience treatment success at all time 
points (day 21 adjusted incidence ratio 1.7 [95% CI: 1.4 to 2.2]). Intervention effects were 
dramatic in breastfed infants (number needed to treat for day 21 success 2.6 [95% CI: 2.0 to 
3.6]) but were insignificant in formula-fed infants.
LIMITATIONS: There were insufficient data to make conclusions for formula-fed infants with 
colic.
CONCLUSIONS: L reuteri DSM17938 is effective and can be recommended for breastfed infants 
with colic. Its role in formula-fed infants with colic needs further research.

Downloaded from 
 Infant colic, or excessive crying of 
unknown cause, is a burdensome 
condition affecting ∼1 in 5 infants 
<3 months old.1 It is most commonly 
defined by the modified Wessel’s 
criteria of crying and/or fussing 
>3 hours per day for ≥3 days per 
week.2 It is acutely associated with 
abusive head trauma, 
3, 
 
4 maternal 
depression, 
5, 
 
6 and premature 
cessation of breastfeeding.7 Although 
it is believed to be a self-resolving 
condition, there is emerging evidence 
of its long-term adverse effects on 
child behavior, sleep, and allergy 
outcomes.8, 
 
9 Despite years of 
research, its etiology remains elusive, 
and management options are limited.
In the past decade, numerous studies 
have demonstrated differences in 
gut microbiota between infants 
with and without colic.10 
– 
21 The 
role of probiotics in colic has come 
into the limelight, with a handful 
of randomized controlled trials 
indicating Lactobacillus reuteri 
DSM17938 to show promise in 
managing colic. However, results 
have been conflicting. Three studies 
of breastfed infants with colic 
demonstrated the probiotic to be 
effective.22 
–24 In contrast, 1 study 
of both breastfed and formula-fed 
infants with colic, the largest so far, 
concluded it was ineffective even for 
those who were breastfed.25
Several recent meta-analyses have 
indicated that Lactobacillus reuteri 
DSM17938 may be effective in 
breastfed infants with colic.26 
–30 
However, such meta-analyses do 
not overcome the limitations and 
biases of individual trials because 
they generate a single best estimate 
through the pooling of treatment 
effect estimates. In contrast, an 
individual participant data meta-
analysis (IPDMA) pools raw data 
from individual studies to create 
sufficient power to produce more 
reliable estimates of treatment 
effects, allow for subgroup analyses, 
and provide more definitive 
conclusions. Because probiotic effects 
and mechanisms of action are strain 
specific, this IPDMA is restricted to a 
single strain of the probiotic L reuteri 
DSM17398.
Our objectives in this IPDMA were 
to determine if L reuteri DSM17398 
effectively reduces crying and/or 
fussing in infants with colic when 
compared with a placebo at 21 days 
postrandomization and whether its 
effects are modified by 4 specific 
characteristics specified a priori (eg, 
feeding type, proton pump inhibition 
exposure, hypoallergenic formula 
exposure for formula-fed infants, and 
maternal dairy elimination diets for 
breastfed infants).
MeThods
The details of our methodology 
are described in the published 
protocol.31 The IPDMA is registered 
through the international prospective 
register of systematic reviews 
(CRD42014013210) and approved by 
the Royal Children’s Hospital Human 
Research Ethics Committee (34081).
eligibility Criteria and search 
Methods
The IPDMA included registered 
double-blind randomized controlled 
trials of the probiotic L reuteri 
DSM17398 versus a placebo, 
delivered orally to infants with 
modified Wessel’s definition of 
infant colic as recorded by diaries, 
questionnaires, or parental 
interviews. We included studies 
published electronically by June 
2017. Reported outcomes had 
to include infant crying and/or 
fussing duration. Studies in which 
researchers evaluated L reuteri ATCC 
55730, the mother strain of L reuteri 
DSM 17938, were excluded. We 
identified studies through searching 
online databases using the following 
medical subject headings32 terms and 
keywords and limiting to all infants 
(birth to 23 months old): (1) medical 
subject headings terms included 
“colic or crying or irritable mood, and 
probiotics or L reuteri”; (2) keywords 
included “colic* or cry* or irritab*, 
and probiotic* or lactobacillus 
reut*”. We searched PubMed (1966 
to December 2014), Medline (Ovid, 
1946 to December 2014), Embase 
(Ovid, 1980 to December 2014), the 
Cumulative Index of Nursing and 
Allied Health Literature (1980 to 
December 2014), the Database of 
Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (1994 
to December 2014), Cochrane Central 
Register of Controlled Trials (www. 
thecochranelibrar 
y. 
com; through 
December 2014), e-abstracts from 
the Pediatric Academic Societies 
meetings, reference lists from 
articles, and Internet searches for 
non–peer-reviewed articles. PubMed 
was searched by using keywords 
only to retrieve e-pubs and items 
not indexed in Medline. The Medline 
search strategy was adapted for use 
in other databases. We also searched 
for ongoing trials through clinical 
trial registries (metaRegister of 
Controlled Trials; see http:// 
www. 
isrctn. 
com/ 
page/ 
mrct, https:// 
clinicaltrials. 
gov, http:// 
www. 
who. 
int/ 
ictrp/ 
en/ 
, and www. 
bioportfolio. 
com).
We assessed the risk of bias for each 
study by using the criteria outlined 
by Cochrane. We also assessed 
for publication bias by identifying 
registered trials that were not 
published and through funnel plot 
analysis.
All authors of eligible trials were 
contacted initially by e-mail then 
connected by teleconference, and 
they participated in a face-to-
face meeting in June 2014 at the 
International Scientific Association 
for Probiotics and Prebiotics 
(ISAPP) Meeting in Aberdeen, 
United Kingdom. The project 
coordination and data management 
teams (V.S., M.C., F.D., and D.T.) 
corresponded regularly by e-mail 
and teleconference throughout 
2014–2016. Through e-mail 
correspondence, statistician F.D. 
communicated with participating

 authors and collected data 
into a single, secure electronic 
database. Statisticians F.D. and 
D.T. independently inspected the 
data with respect to range, internal 
consistency, and missing items by 
checking them against published 
reports. The authors met again at 
the 2016 ISAPP meeting in Turku, 
Finland, to finalize the results. In 
 
Fig 1, we demonstrate the baseline 
variables collected from the included 
studies. In Table 1, we show the 
baseline characteristics.
Main outcomes
As described in our protocol, the 
primary outcomes of the IPDMA 
were infant crying and/or fussing 
duration (minutes per day) and 
treatment success, which is defined 
as ≥50% reduction in crying and/
or fussing time from baseline and at 
21 days postintervention. Secondary 
outcomes were infant crying and/or 
fussing duration (minutes per day) 
and treatment success at 7 and 14 
days postintervention. Infant crying 
and/or fussing duration (minutes per 
day) was available from all included 
studies at baseline and 7, 14, and 21 
days postintervention.
sample size Calculation
As detailed in the IPDMA protocol, 
we estimated that ∼120 infants per 
treatment group would be sufficient 
for detecting a mean difference in 
treatment groups of 80 minutes 
per day (power = 0.80; 2-tailed α = 
.05) as well as provide 80% power 
for detecting a difference of 20 
percentage points (2-tailed α = .05) in 
the treatment’s success rates.31
statistical Analysis
The analyses were conducted  
by 2 independent statisticians  
(F.D. and D.T.). Individual participant 
data from all studies were modeled 
simultaneously in multilevel 
generalized linear mixed-effects 
regression models to account for 
the nesting of observations within 
participants and of participants 
within studies by using PROC 
GLIMMIX in SAS (SAS Institute, 
Inc, Cary, NC).34 Models were 
specified with fixed main effects

 and interaction terms for each 
individual participant’s binary 
indicator treatment assignment 
(probiotic versus control) and study 
time point (7, 14, and 21 days) to 
permit estimating time point–specific 
treatment effects. Random intercepts 
for participants were used to account 
for residual within-participant 
correlation. Standard choices of link 
and variance functions were specified 
according to type of outcome, 
with linear-normal models used to 
estimate between-arm differences 
in adjusted mean changes in crying 
duration and adjusted proportion 
differences in treatment success (for 
use in computing numbers needed 
to treat), and log-Poisson models 
were used to estimate adjusted 
treatment success incidence ratios. 
SE estimates for confidence interval 
(CI) estimation and test statistics 
were based on robust empirical 
sandwich estimators with small-
sample correction.35
Of the 4 candidate effect modifiers 
selected a priori for subgroup 
analyses, only feeding type 
was available with sufficient 
completeness to examine 
heterogeneity. Based on available 
data, feeding type was classified 
as exclusively or predominantly 
breastfed versus formula fed. The 
latter group came exclusively from 
the Australian study. Heterogeneity 
of treatment effects was formally 
assessed by respecifying regression 
models with interaction terms for 
the binary treatment indicator 
with the candidate effect modifier 
and conducting formal hypothesis 
testing (with a statistical significance 
threshold reset to 0.10 to help 
offset the low statistical power 
associated with testing interaction 
terms). Confounders identified a 
priori included (1) family history 
of atopy, (2) delivery type (vaginal 
versus cesarean), and (3) enrollment 
age. All included studies excluded 
infants with a history of antibiotic 
use, eliminating the need to use this 
variable as a covariate. We analyzed 
by intention to treat, specifically, the 
binary treatment term corresponded 
to assigned treatment.
ResULTs
The search yielded 282 abstracts, 
of which 194 were screened after 
duplicates were removed, and 17 
full-text articles were assessed for 
eligibility (Supplemental Fig 3). Four 
double-blind randomized controlled 
trials involving 345 infants with colic 
(174 probiotic and 171 placebo) met 
eligibility criteria and were included 
in this IPDMA. All 4 studies provided 
individual participant data. Their 
baseline characteristics are described 
in Table 1, and the risk of bias 
assessment is in Supplemental Fig 4. 
In assessing for publication bias, we 
identified only 1 potentially eligible 
registered trial (NCT01855269) that 
was completed but unpublished. 
We performed funnel plot analysis, 
and the data from the 4 studies 
appeared symmetric, suggesting 
publication bias was unlikely (data 
not shown). However, with <10 
studies, the usefulness of funnel plots 
for revealing patterns is limited.36 
Selective reporting of outcomes is 
not a concern because we verified 
that the study outcomes analyzed 
were properly listed on the relevant 
trial registration, and our outcome 
is based on a single and widely used 
standard measure: crying and/or 
fussing duration.
All 4 trials included breastfed infants 
with colic; only 1 trial included 
formula-fed infants with colic.25 
In the Italian trial, all mothers of 
breastfed infants were on a dairy-
elimination diet.22 All studies 
reported no adverse events. Within 
each trial, there were no differences 
between treatment groups in 
baseline variables, and all data 
supplied by the authors matched 
precisely the results published in 
their individual articles. In Fig 1, 
we show the different types of data 
available from the 4 studies. All 4 
trials collected data on infant crying 
and/or fussing duration, feeding 
method, age of enrollment, and sex, 
and all 4 studies excluded infants 
who used antibiotics. Two studies 
used diaries, in which parents 
estimated their infants’ crying 
duration at the end of the day, 
22, 
23 
whereas 2 studies used the Baby’s 
Day Diary, 
33 which records crying 
and fussing duration every 5 minutes, 
with mothers filling in their diaries 
every few hours.24, 
 
25 Three of the 4 
trials had available data on delivery 
type (vaginal versus cesarean) and 
family history of atopy; 1 study 
reported these variables but did not 
have available individual participant 
data. One study was industry 
sponsored or funded.22
In Fig 2A, we show the actual mean 
crying and/or fussing durations by 
treatment group at baseline and at 
days 7, 14, and 21. The crying and/
or fussing duration was reduced 
in both the probiotic and placebo 
groups but was significantly shorter 
in the probiotic group at all follow-up 
time points (P < .05). In Fig 2B, we 
depict the adjusted mean between-
arm (probiotic versus placebo) 
differences in changes in crying and/
or fussing duration from baseline to 
each of the 3 follow-up time points. 
The probiotic group experienced a 
significantly greater reduction in 
crying and/or fussing duration at 7 
and 21 days than the placebo group 
(mean difference in change from 
baseline between groups was −21.0 
[95% CI: −42.0 to −0.05] minutes 
per day at day 7 and −25.4 [95% CI: 
−47.3 to −3.5] minutes per day at 
day 21; Table 2). Furthermore, the 
probiotic group was almost twice 
as likely as the placebo group to 
experience treatment success at all 
time points (adjusted incidence ratios 
were 2.08 [95% CI: 1.26 to 3.42], 1.98 
[95% CI: 1.46 to 2.70], and 1.71 [95% 
CI: 1.35 to 2.15] for days 7, 14, and 
21, respectively; Table 3).

 The positive effect was seen more 
dramatically in the breastfed 
infants and was not seen at all in 
the formula-fed infants. For infants 
with colic who were breastfed, 
the probiotic group’s reduction 
in crying and/or fussing duration 
from baseline was 46 minutes per 
day more than the placebo group’s 
(adjusted mean difference in change 
from baseline was −46.4 [95% CI: 
−67.2 to −25.5]) at day 21 (Table 2). 
This beneficial effect was statistically 
significant at days 7 and 14 as well. 
For breastfed infants with colic, the 
probiotic group was 2 to 3 times 
more likely than the placebo group 
to experience treatment success 
(adjusted incidence ratios were 3.03 
[95% CI: 1.68 to 5.48], 2.27 [95% 
CI: 1.63 to 3.15], and 2.07 [95% CI: 
1.60 to 2.68, 
] at days 7, 14, and 21, 
respectively; Table 3). The number 
needed to treat (NNT) for day 21 
success in breastfed infants was 
2.6 (95% CI: 2.0 to 3.6). This is in 
contrast to the formula-fed infants 
(n = 78), with the probiotic group 
experiencing less reduction in crying 
and/or fussing as compared with 
the placebo group at all time points 
and being less likely to experience 
treatment success (Table 3).
dIsCUssIon
This is the first IPDMA and the most 
definitive method to assess the 
effectiveness of L reuteri DSM17938 
in managing infants with colic. The 
pooled data suggest that L reuteri 
DSM17938 effectively reduces crying 
and/or fussing in breastfed infants 
with colic. Although the results of this 
study help clarify the debate on the 
usefulness of L reuteri DSM 17938 
in improving colic symptoms in 
breastfed infants, its role in formula-
fed infants with colic needs further 
clarification.
The study has many strengths. Its 
main strength is its large sample 
size from the pooling of data from 
existing studies, which provides 
enough power to detect treatment 
effects and subgroup differences. All 
included studies were double-blind 
randomized placebo-controlled 
trials of high quality. Lower-quality 
studies were excluded, such as the 
2015 Mi et al37 study, which was 
single-blind, and the 2015 Ashraf 
et al38 and 2017 Martinelli et al39 
studies, which were nonblinded.

panel B, the data represent the predicted mean difference between treatment groups in the change 
in crying and/or fussing duration from baseline (probiotic minus placebo). A negative difference 
implies the probiotic group had more of a reduction in crying and/or fussing duration from baseline 
than the placebo had. For example, at day 21, the probiotic group had ∼25 minutes per day more 
reduction in crying and/or fussing duration from baseline than the placebo had.

 The intervention groups in all 4 
studies received the same probiotic 
(L reuteri DSM17398) manufactured 
by the same company (BioGaia, 
Stockholm, Sweden) in the same dose 
(0.2 × 108 colony-forming units per 
drop, 5 drops orally per day), with 
the control groups all receiving the 
same placebo (maltodextrin in oil 
suspension). All 4 included studies 
collected the same primary outcome 
measure of infant crying and/or 
fussing duration as well as measures 
of important potential confounders. 
We identified confounders a priori 
and were able to adjust for them 
in our analyses. Intention-to-
treat analyses were conducted by 
statisticians independent of the 4 
included trials to eliminate bias. We 
were able to analyze outcomes by 
taking into account within-infant 
changes, thus adjusting for between-
infant differences, such as infant age. 
In addition, the IPDMA is up to date. 
We are aware of only 1 unpublished 
double-blind randomized placebo-
controlled trial from the United 
States that is small and focused on 
safety and biomarkers rather than 
efficacy (n = 20, breastfed infants 
with colic, personal communication 
with J.M.R).13 Adding this trial to 
the IPDMA is unlikely to change this 
study’s conclusions. The IPDMA 
results have now yielded more 
definitive conclusions for the role 
of L reuteri DSM17938 in breastfed 
infants with colic.
However, there are several 
limitations to the study. First, it 
included studies with differing 
methods of defining infant colic and 
measuring outcomes. Two studies 
used a nonvalidated diary involving 
recall of infant crying duration at 
the end of the day, 
22, 
 
23 whereas 2 
studies used the Baby’s Day Diary, 
 
33 which is a validated measure of 
infant crying and involves less degree 
of recall bias, with mothers filling 
it in every few hours throughout 
the day.24, 
25 The latter 2 studies 
included fussing, defined as a

41 in their outcome 
measures, whereas the former 2 
studies did not. The Australian study 
was a pragmatic trial to reflect a 
more real-life situation, including 
infants on antireflux medications and 
hypoallergenic and probiotic and/
or prebiotic formulae, 
25 whereas the 
other studies were explanatory trials 
with strict inclusion criteria.22– 
24 
Second, we are unable to make 
definitive conclusions regarding 
the effectiveness of the probiotic 
for formula-fed infants with colic 
because only 1 study included a 
limited number of formula-fed 
infants. Third, we were not able 
to determine if the probiotic’s 
effects differed according to proton 
pump inhibitor (PPI) exposure, 
hypoallergenic formula exposure, 
or maternal dairy-elimination diets 
because such information was not 
available from all studies. For the 
same reason, we were unable to 
report on secondary outcomes, such 
as infant sleep duration, parental 
report of treatment success, maternal 
depression, quality of life, family 
functioning, adverse effects, stool 
colonization, or fecal calprotectin 
levels.
Our study results are more definitive 
than (and in keeping with) the 
previous published meta-analyses 
on this topic.27,

42 The difference in 
the effects of L reuteri DSM17938 on 
breastfed as compared with formula-
fed infants with colic is interesting 
and worthy of further investigation. 
Breastfed and formula-fed infants 
have different gut microbiota 
compositions, with Bifidobacteria 
reported to dominate in breastfed 
infants, whereas formula-fed infants  
have more diverse gut microbiota.43, 
44  
The unique composition of breast 
milk or possibly the direct effects  
of microbes or oligosaccharides  
in breast milk may contribute to 
these differences.43, 
 
45, 
 
46 It is also 
possible that particular ingredients  
in formula may negate the effects  
of the probiotic. However, feeding  
type has not been shown to affect  
the occurrence of infant colic.1, 
47  
Of note, the Australian trial 
included 99 formula-fed infants, 
of which ∼33% were on probiotic-
containing formulae without L 
reuteri DSM17938, 17% were on 
prebiotic-containing formulae 
(unpublished data), and 15% were 
on hypoallergenic formulae without 
clinical symptoms suggestive of 
cow’s milk protein allergy. In 
addition, ∼30% were on PPIs, which 
are known to be ineffective for 
infant crying. It is possible that PPIs, 
concurrent probiotics, or prebiotics 
may alter the gut microbiome and 
hence affect L reuteri’s effectiveness; 
however, the proportions of infants 
taking these different formulae 
and PPIs were equally distributed 
between the probiotic and placebo 
groups and, therefore, would 
unlikely contribute to the negative 
results. The effectiveness of L 
reuteri DSM17938 in infant colic 
seems to be linked to breastfeeding, 
but the exact mechanism remains 
unknown. Comparison analyses using 
advanced sequencing techniques 
of available fecal samples collected 
in this IPDMA’s participants would 
be useful in gaining an insight into 
whether differences in microbiota 
composition may play a part.
There is a pressing need for more 
rigorous randomized controlled trials 
of L reuteri DSM17938 in formula-
fed infants with colic. However, 
in the era of widespread addition 
of probiotic mixtures to standard 
infant formula, such trials may be 
difficult to implement. Nevertheless, 
the collaboration formed through 
this IPDMA will be the platform 
to conduct future IPDMAs for 
the probiotic management and 
prevention of infant colic. The
