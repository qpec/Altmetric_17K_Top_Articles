In Brief
Emotional learning in anxiety patients
leads to less discrimination of the
dangerous stimulus from other similar
stimuli. Due to plasticity in the neural
representation that persists well after the
emotional context ceased, patients
cannot distinguish new safe stimuli from
the previously dangerous stimulus.
Laufer et al. further identify the underlying
brain regions.

SUMMARY
Overgeneralization of dangerous stimuli is a possible
etiological account for anxiety disorders, yet the un-
derlying behavioral and neural origins remain vague.
Specifically, it is unclear whether this is a choice
behavior in an unsafe environment (‘‘better safe
than sorry’’) or also a fundamental change in how
the stimulus is perceived. We show that anxiety pa-
tients have wider generalization for loss-conditioned
tone when compared to controls and do so even in
a safe context that requires a different behavioral
policy. Moreover, patients overgeneralized for gain-
conditioned tone as well. Imaging (fMRI) revealed
that in anxiety only, activations during conditioning
in the dACC and the putamen were correlated with
later overgeneralization of loss and gain, respec-
tively, whereas valence distinction in the amygdala
and hippocampus during conditioning mediated the
difference between loss and gain generalization.
During generalization itself, neural discrimination
based on multivoxel patterns in auditory cortex and
amygdala revealed specific stimulus-related plas-
ticity. Our results suggest that overgeneralization in
anxiety has perceptual origins and involves affective
modulation of stimulus representations in primary
cortices and amygdala.
INTRODUCTION
Stimulus generalization is a fundamental learning mechanism by
which an acquired response for a specific stimulus is transferred
to other similar, but not identical, stimuli [1, 2]. When the stimulus
predicts aversive outcomes, it makes sense to have a wider
generalization and respond similarly to stimuli that are even
less similar to the original conditioned one; this is because a
miss (incorrectly identifying the dangerous stimulus as a safe
one) is more costly than a false alarm (incorrectly identifying a
safe stimulus as the conditioned one) [3–5]. Here, we call such
response bias a ‘‘better safe than sorry’’ approach.
Recent studies have suggested that overgeneralization can
underlie anxiety disorders [6–8]. In this account, following forma-
tion of association between a stimulus and an aversive outcome,
stimuli that are only somewhat similar to the original stimulus
would still elicit increased anxiety in affected individuals [8–13].
In an unsafe environment full of complex stimuli where the orig-
inal stimulus is still dangerous, this is an extreme but rational
strategy.
An additional possibility is that anxiety patients overgener-
alize not only because of a choice bias [14] but also because
they perceive the stimulus differently after it was associated
with affective content [15, 16]. In this account, learning with re-
inforcers induces plasticity that changes early stimulus repre-
sentation and results in less discrimination and therefore
more generalization, even in a later safe context. Supporting
evidence comes from findings that negative reinforcers can
result in changes in stimulus perception [11, 17, 18]. Here, we
hypothesized that such a basic mechanism can contribute to
anxiety responses and that patients would have compromised
perception that contributes to overgeneralization. We further
hypothesized that this would be paralleled by changes in stim-
ulus representations in sensory regions that are modulated by
affective regions.
RESULTS
Human subjects underwent a conditioning session in which
three well-separated pure tones were assigned as conditioned
stimulus (CS) gain, CS loss, and CS neutral (300 Hz, 500 Hz,
and 700 Hz, counterbalanced across subjects; 21 trials each,
presented in pseudorandom order). The CS loss could be fol-
lowed by monetary loss and the CS gain by monetary gain (Fig-
ure 1A; [17]; CS neutral was never followed by any outcome).
Once conditioning was over, a generalization phase was initiated
and announced (Figure 1A), in which a tone appeared in each trial
and the subjects had to indicate whether this is one of the
two reinforced tones they had heard in the previous conditioning
phase or a different new tone (a loss, gain, or neither response).
A correct classification resulted in monetary gain. There
were 15 unique tones overall, the two original CSs and
[±20%, ±10%, ±3%] around each CS (generalized stimulus,
GS), and the CS neutral. Importantly, notice that in this general-
ization phase the context is safe (the CS loss no longer entails
loss), and, moreover, the two original reinforced tones, CS loss
and CS gain, require the same behavioral policy. The optimal
behavior is therefore to have an as-narrow-as-possible general-
ization around both original tones, i.e., to identify all GSs as
‘‘neither’’ and the two CSs as either ‘‘loss’’ or ‘‘gain.’’

 We combine here the data acquired previously in healthy sub-
jects [17] with new data acquired from patients with generalized
anxiety disorder (GAD, n = 28). The goal is to compare and iden-
tify differences between the two populations in behavior and in
brain activations.
Wider Generalization in Anxiety
We found that subjects with GAD (n = 28) have wider generaliza-
tion than controls (n = 16) around the aversive CS loss (Figure 1B;
F = 41.34, p < 0.01, group main effect, two-way ANOVA). Inter-
estingly, patients showed wider generalization around gain-
related tone as well (Figure 1C). Still, in both groups there was
wider generalization for loss than for gain (Figure 1D; F = 4.73,
p < 0.05, valence main effect, two-way ANOVA) [5, 11, 17]. More-
over, the width of generalization around the loss-related tone
corresponded to Hamilton anxiety scores (Figures S1A–S1C;
F = 3.58, p < 0.05, one-way ANOVA and p < 0.05, Pearson; but
not around gain-related tone, F = 1.33, p > 0.1; or for the differ-
ences between loss and gain slopes, F = 0.94, p > 0.1).
The wider generalization in anxiety was not due to di-
fferences in baseline auditory performance or in the learning
(Figures 2A–2C), was not observed around a neutral uncondi-
tioned tone (Figures 2D and 2E; Figure 1C), and did not differ
across gender (two-way ANOVA, F = 0.62, p = 0.43 for gender
effect; F = 1.95, p = 0.16 for valence effect; F = 0.7, p = 0.4 for
interaction). We also found seemingly normal generalization
curves in a control group of major depressive disorder patients
(Figures S1D and S1E; F = 2.18, p > 0.1, group main effect; n =
11 with no GAD diagnosis but with similar medication profile).
These findings support the notion that anxiety patients over-
generalize due to altered perception of the stimulus and there-
fore do so even in a safe context when the original stimulus is
no longer dangerous and even when the generalization harms
them. We further hypothesized that there should be evidence
for altered neural representations that are formed during
conditioning.
Brain Activity that Differentiates Generalization in
Anxiety
To identify neural activations, a subset of patients from the GAD
group and all healthy controls underwent functional imaging dur-
ing task performance (fMRI, n = 16 GAD and n = 16 controls), and

other button to avoid monetary loss. In the generalization phase that followed (the focus of this study), subjects heard different tones and had to choose whether it
was one of the tones that was conditioned in the previous phase (independent if it was the gain- or loss-related tone) or another, new tone.

 we conducted two types of analyses. The first analysis was con-
ducted on a wide set of a priori regions of interest (ROIs) selected
due to their implication in emotional learning, emotional modula-
tion, and sensory-auditory representation: all prefrontal cortices
(PFCs), the striatum (caudate and putamen), auditory cortices
(BA41, BA42, BA21, BA22), insula (BA13), hippocampus, amyg-
dala,andthethalamus.Thesecondanalysiswasconductedusing
a whole-brain approach (this analysis replicated the findings in the
above-mentioned regions and further revealed additional frontal
and midbrain activity detailed in the Supplemental Information).
To identify regions that play a differential role in generaliza-
tion between anxiety and controls, we performed three kinds
of analyses. The first examined differential activity during
conditioning. The second examined differential activity during
conditioning but that correlates with later individual width of
generalization. The third examined activity during the general-
ization itself and uses neural discrimination measures to
compare activity between the conditioned and its surrounding
stimuli. The rationale behind this set of analyses follows the
rationale of our task design: the affective manipulation occurs
during the conditioning itself rather than during the generaliza-
tion, and we therefore look for activity during conditioning that
induces plasticity that is later reflected during generalization in
the (in)ability to discriminate the stimuli. All analyses employed

Learning or Basic Auditory Performance
(A) Baseline discrimination thresholds (just-noticeable difference [JND]) for GAD patients and control group (p > 0.5, t test). JND was tested with a standard 2AFC
auditory task using adaptive staircase procedure (n = 14 GAD, 16 controls).
(B) Learning rates were similar across groups and valence (p > 0.1, group and valence effects and interactions, p < 0.005, acquisition stage main effect three-way
ANOVA). Shown are correct response rates in the conditioning phase. All subjects quickly learned to discriminate between the 300 and 700 Hz pure tones that
served as CSs (counterbalanced across subjects) and associate them correctly. Behavior reached plateau around the fifth trial and was not different across
anxiety or control and gain or loss (n = 28 GAD, 16 controls).
(C) During generalization, there was no difference between anxiety patients and controls in correct responses to the conditioned tone (either gain or loss) (p > 0.1,
group main effect, two-way ANOVA), indicating that CS loss and CS gain were learned to similar extents in patients and controls and that there were no between-
group differences in attentional factors (n = 28 GAD, 16 controls). The fact that the CS loss was associated with fewer correct responses than the CS gain is a
result of the wide generalization and less discrimination observed around it. In other words, if a subject cannot discriminate between two close tones (e.g., the CS
loss and +3% from it), then fewer correct identifications would occur for both.
(D) Proportion of trials identified as the original tone but for a neutral-unpaired tone (in % Hz, same as Figures 1B and 1C), for anxiety patients (n = 10) and controls
(n = 10). Notice that controls had similar narrow generalization (see E below), further suggesting that the wider generalization for loss and gain (Figures 1B and 1C)
is due to affective conditioning.

 the contrast between the anxiety group and the control group
as the main objective of the current study.
Differential Activity during Conditioning between
Anxiety and Controls
To determine group differences in activations during the con-
ditioning phase, a two-sample t test of loss > baseline and
gain > baseline contrasts was conducted within a general linear
model framework that incorporated both groups (Figure 3; Table
S1). Activations were higher in anxiety in dorsal anterior cingulate
cortex (ACC) (BA24,32) and caudate and in the primary auditory
cortex (BA41). In contrast, activations were higher in controls
mainly in ventro-medial PFC and ventral ACC (BA10,24). These
differential activations in PFC are compatible with the roles of
the ACC in promoting anxiety and fear and the role of the ven-
tro-medial cortices in fear modulation and safety [19–22].
Activity during Conditioning that Contributes to Wider
Generalization
To identify the regions in which activity during conditioning
contributed to subsequent wider generalization, we calculated
individual slopes of generalization curves and used them as co-
variate with loss > baseline or gain > baseline contrasts, within
the GAD versus controls model. We emphasize that neural activ-
ity is taken from the conditioning phase, but behavior is taken
from the generalization phase that comes only later. This analysis
allows us to examine the regions that separately contribute to
either gain or loss generalization.
In the loss > baseline contrast, activations in the dorsal-ACC
(BA24 and 32) were correlated with individual generalization
slopes (Figure 4A; Table S2). There was a significant relationship,
larger in GAD relative to controls, between activations in these
regions and the extent of overgeneralization, suggesting that
the higher the activity during the loss-conditioning trials, the
more the individual subsequently generalized for the loss-condi-
tioned tone (Figure 4A; Figure S2A; notice these correlation plots
report the size of the effect and its directionality and do not
constitute additional non-independent significance tests). In
contrast, in the gain > baseline condition, the Putamen activity

was correlated with later generalization of
gain (Figure 4B), across both populations
together, but again only for anxiety pa-
tientswhentested individually(Figure S2B).
These findings suggest that there might be
separate contributions for affective modulation via the dorsal
anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and the putamen, the former
contributes more during negative experiences and the latter
more during positive ones; however, each contributes to wider
generalization in anxiety patients.
Yet, anxiety patients, just like controls, were able to differen-
tiate loss from gain and further exhibited an even wider general-
ization in the loss domain when compared to the gain (Figures 1
and 2). To examine this and to identify shared mechanisms that
compare valence, we created a loss > gain contrast and used as
covariate the difference in individual slopes of generalization
(loss minus gain). This revealed that activity in the amygdala dur-
ing conditioning was correlated with later individual differences
in generalization between loss and gain (Figure 5), as well as in
the posterior hippocampus (Figure S3).
If the amygdala is involved as a shared mechanism across
valence for generalization, and the ACC and putamen contribute
valence-specific information for generalization (at least in the
current generalization task), then there might be matching func-
tional link during learning. To test this, a functional connectivity
analysis (psychophysiological interaction [PPI]) was performed
using the amygdala as seed, revealing increased connectivity
between the right amygdala and right dACC (BA24) during
loss-conditioning trials only and between right amygdala and pu-
tamen during gain-conditioning trials only (Figure S4; Table S3).
No significant functional connectivity was found when using the
posterior hippocampus as seed.
Neural Discrimination during Generalization
All analyses until now examined activity during conditioning,
either independently or with relation to later behavioral general-
ization. To identify regions that contributed directly during the
generalization, we tested whether overall differences in general-
ization between the four experimental conditions (anxiety or con-
trol 3 loss or gain) would be reflected in neural discrimination
measures between the CSs and their respective surrounding
GS tones. For each subject, neural discrimination was quantified
as the correlation between spatial patterns of activity [23] evoked
during the generalization stage by the CS and the GSs. All

 regions implicated in any of the previous analyses were exam-
ined. We found that in the primary auditory cortex (BA41), the
correlation was significantly higher in anxiety than in controls
for both gain and loss (Figure 6A; group main effect F =
13.85 p < 0.001, two-way ANOVA). However, only in the amyg-
dala did neural discrimination match the behavior across all
four conditions (Figure 6B, left; group main effect F = 10.03 p <
0.01, two-way ANOVA); namely, high discrimination (low correla-
tion) for control gain that exhibited a narrow generalization;
smaller for control loss, exhibiting wider generalization [11, 17];
even smaller for anxiety gain that exhibited even wider general-
ization; and lowest discrimination for anxiety loss that indeed ex-
hibited the widest generalization. Moreover, the amygdala
showed a significant correlation at an individual level between
generalization slopes and neural discrimination (Figure 6B, right;
r = �0.45, p < 0.001). These patterns are likely due to condition-
ing because comparing early to late trials showed that the largest
reduction in neural discrimination occurred for CS loss in the
amygdala (Figures S5D–S5F). In contrast, neural discrimination
remained high for comparing CS loss or CS gain with a well-
separated unpaired neutral CS (Figures S5A–S5C), reinforcing
the idea that detection improves (Figure S1F) [24], even though
discrimination deteriorates. Other regions that contributed dur-
ing conditioning did not show such relationship between neural
discrimination and behavior during generalization (Figure S6).
DISCUSSION
Our study shows that anxiety patients overgeneralize after
conditioning with affective stimuli and provides evidence that
they have altered perception of simple stimulus features. There
are two important factors of the experimental design that
support this finding: first, we used simple stimuli of basic fea-
tures as pure frequency tones; second, and importantly, the

 generalization occurred in a safe context when the stimuli no
longer entail danger. We then identified neural pathways that
participate in affective modulation during conditioning: the puta-
men for gain, the ACC for loss, and the amygdala for both.
Finally, we show that amygdala activity during generalization it-
self correlates with extent of behavioral generalization across
valence and anxiety, and auditory cortex activity differentiated
between anxiety and controls (but not valence). The combined
evidence suggests that in anxiety patients, affective stimuli
shape early sensory representations during conditioning, and
these altered representations later result in less discrimination
between the conditioned stimulus and new safe stimuli.
In the current paradigm, the generalization phase takes place
after conditioning already occurred and the stimulus no longer
predicts a negative outcome. Yet, even in this safe context, pa-
tients still have wide generalization. This is an important addition
to previous studies where the aversive conditioning occurs dur-
ing the generalization as well [9, 13, 25–27], and wider general-
ization can therefore be attributed to a decision bias. Moreover,
if losing is a source of anxiety (as during conditioning), then in the
generalization phase they should try to minimize it by making
fewer errors, hence resulting in narrower generalization. How-
ever, patients still overgeneralize. This implies that the general-
ization effects were due, at least in part, to fundamental changes
in how patients perceived the stimulus and to what extent they
could discriminate it from other stimuli [11, 17].
An additional finding was that patients overgeneralize to gain-
conditioned stimulus as well. This could reflect the fact that pa-
tients constantly screen for ominous future scenarios, and a gain
situation automatically activates the prospect of loss. Alterna-
tively, it could stem from differential sensitivity to reward and
altered processing in reward circuits [28–30], in line with our
finding of putamen activity during conditioning that correlated
with gain generalization. An additional likely interpretation, one
that is not mutually exclusive and supported by the reward sensi-
tivity as well, is that there is heightened sensitivity in patients to
any affective stimulus and its impact on early sensory mecha-
nisms. This option is in line with the hypothesis and findings of
the current study, specifically with the occurrence of generaliza-
tion in a later safe context, but also from the observed neural
activations.
Indeed, we identified a network in which activity during con-
ditioning correlates with the generalization extent in patients
only. The ACC activity during loss-conditioning trials contrib-
uted to later less discrimination around the loss-conditioned
tone, as well as correlated with amygdala activity. This is in
line with the body of evidence showing that medial-prefrontal
cortex (mPFC)-amygdala interactions are required for correct
fear discrimination and safety learning [31–33]. On the other
hand, putamen activity during gain-conditioning trials contrib-
uted to later less discrimination around the gain-conditioned
tone, and it was also correlated with the amygdala. Interest-
ingly, the amygdala and hippocampus activity during condi-
tioning also correlated with later generalization but only when
taking the difference between gain and loss. For the hippocam-
pus, this is in accordance with its well-established role in many
forms of generalization [25, 34–37] and with its role in trait anx-
iety [38].
These pathways likely contribute to modulate stimulus repre-
sentations that later underlie generalization patterns, and we
therefore used neural discrimination measures to unveil the
regions in which activity directly matched behavioral discrimina-
tion of individual subjects. The auditory cortex matched differ-
ences between anxiety and controls, but not across valence,
suggesting that in individuals with anxiety, there is a larger or
faster tendency to modulate representations in auditory cortex.
This is in line with evidence from animal models demonstrating
that both aversive and rewarding information can induce
plasticity [39–43], one that is retained even following extinction
[44, 45]. A natural candidate to drive such change is the afore-
mentioned correlation between amygdala activity during condi-
tioning and later generalization across valence [46].

 In addition to its role during conditioning, the amygdala
showed tight correlation between neural and behavioral discrim-
ination across both anxiety and valence, providing evidence for
its additional role in production of generalization due to plasticity
that occurred in previous conditioning [17, 47–49]. This is much
in line with its role in auditory pathways as well as in production of
fear responses and with recent evidence for specific changes in
auditory tuning curves within the amygdala [50]. Whereas other
regions such as the insula were found to contribute to perceptual
generalization in healthy subjects [17, 25], we did not find differ-
ences between anxiety and controls; yet, it is important to keep
in mind that such null results can stem from sample size and
other study limitations.
To conclude, overgeneralization following aversive experi-
ences and/or in anxiety populations can result from both percep-
tual stimulus generalization [8, 15] and other cognitive sources
(e.g., choice bias) [1, 7, 25], and the final generalization profile
depends on several factors [16]. Here, we provide evidence
that an affective stimulus induces changes in the core represen-
tation of the conditioned stimulus space and does so to a larger
extent in some individuals via amygdala and primary sensory re-
gions, therefore making these individuals more prone to exhibit
anxiety symptoms.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Subjects
The patient group included GAD ambulatory patients (n = 28). All patients were
diagnosed according to DSM-IV with the duration of illness ranging from 1 year
to more than 15 years (age range, 19–45, mean age ± SEM = 27.96 ± 1.63; 14
females). All participants had normal hearing acuity (a subjective hearing
threshold of 40 dB). The Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale was used in order to
estimate the anxiety symptoms prior to testing with our paradigm. The sepa-
rate group of major depressive disorder (MDD) patients consisted of 11 pa-
tients under medication, and we used Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, 17
items for estimating depressive symptoms. All clinical diagnoses and testing
were performed and followed by D.I. (MD, PhD), a certified psychiatrist and
the head of the department of day hospitalization at the Jerusalem Mental
Health Center.
Twenty-five patients were under SSRI or SNRI treatment, and five patients
from the GAD group were without treatment prior to taking the test. All patients
with MDD were medicated with either SSRI or SNRI. All the GAD patients that
undertook the MRI were on SSRI or SNRI treatment. The SSRI treatment con-
sisted of 19 patients on the following drugs: fluoxetine 20 mg (three patients),
sertraline 50–100 mg (four patients), paroxetine 10–20 mg (six patients), esci-
talopram 10 mg (six patients). The SNRI treatment included venlafaxine in six
patients at 150–225 mg. Patients did not use benzodiazepines more than
1 week prior to testing. No other drugs (i.e., mood stabilizers or antipsychotic
drugs) were used. Patients in the GAD group showing comorbidity included
two patients with panic disorder and one patient with obsessive compulsive
disorder (OCD). There is history of major trauma in two patients without overt
posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. Patients in the GAD
group could have symptoms of depression but did not reach Hamilton scores
of minor MDD.
The control group consisted of 16 healthy subjects that were recruited
through advertisement (age range, 23–32, mean age ± SEM = 25.3 ± 1.12;
seven females). Most of the control group (n = 14) was tested �4 years
ago, and these data were already published [17]. However, the exact same
procedures and equipment were used then and now. This is, therefore, not
a replication of previous findings, but rather we use the control group as
comparison to identify differences between them and the new cohort of
patients.
Experiments were conducted under a Helsinki approval to R.P. and D.I. and
with signed consents. Subjects were paid a flat amount for their participation.

 Paradigm
The experiment consisted of two parts, an acquisition phase, designed to
assign positive, neutral, or negative value to three different pure tones by
learning, and a generalization phase—the target of this study—designed to
test differences in the generalization around the positive and negative
tones [5].
All participants underwent the behavioral version of the experiment, and 16
of 28 GAD patients (age range, 20–45, mean age ± SEM = 30.31 ± 2.00; eight
females) and all 16 healthy subjects were also scanned (fMRI) during the
experiment. For the acquisition phase, subjects were instructed that in each
trial they would hear one of three tones (300, 500, or 700 Hz for 300 ms).
One tone would gain them money, if they pressed one of two keys within
2.5 s after it (a ‘‘positive’’ tone); one tone would always lead to zero outcome
(CS�); and one tone would lose them money, unless they pressed the other
key after it (a ‘‘negative’’ tone). Tones and key assignment were counterbal-
anced across subjects. The experiment was preceded by visual examples of
all possible scenarios and trial types.
Subjects learned by trial and error which tone was the positive and which
was the negative and received visual feedback telling them whether they
earned or lost in the trial. Learning in this paradigm is very fast, and subjects
reach a plateau within few trials and maintain it for the rest of the experiment
[5, 17]. In addition, there were Pavlovian trials (classical conditioning; informed
by the appearance of the word ‘‘helpless’’ on the screen), in which the positive
tone resulted in gain and the negative tone resulted in loss independent of the
response. The randomly intermingled classical trials were implanted to ensure
that the tones retain their valence, and the instrumental trials were implanted to
ensure continuous active involvement and allow a measure of generalization
afterward. Similar generalization behavior is observed with the use of classical
conditioning only [17]. There was an equal amount of trials (21) per each tone,
randomly interleaved, and hence there were 63 trials overall in the acquisition
stage. The loss amount was 0.5 NIS and the gain was of 1 NIS to account for
possible loss-aversion bias of a factor of 2 [5, 17, 51] (in other words, to
equalize intensity of value); preliminary testing showed that an equal amount
for gain and loss does not change the main results.
Subjects were informed when the acquisition stage was over and when a
new different stage began. In this generalization stage, subjects were in-
structed that many different tones would be presented, one in each trial. In
every trial, if they hear the positive or negative tone from the previous phase,
they should press the same key that was previously associated with it; how-
ever, if they hear a tone that is not the exact same tone as either the positive
or the negative tone, they should press a third middle key. They were informed
that they would gain 1 NIS for a correct press (either pressing the appropriate
key for a negative or positive tone, or the middle key for a different tone) or lose
this amount for any mistake (pressing the positive or negative keys for a
different tone, or the middle key for the positive or negative tone). There was
no feedback reported to the subjects in this generalization stage, to avoid
any changes in value of the tones that was acquired during the acquisition
stage. Notice that the original tones are still referred to as positive or negative
tones in the generalization phase, yet they have completely identical re-
quirements and outcomes in this stage and therefore should entail identical
decision-making policies. The generalization stage comprised 15 trials of the
positive tone, 15 trials of the negative tone, and 96 of other tones (i.e., that
required a press on the middle key). These 96 trials consisted of 12 CS� trials
and 84 trials of tones that were ±3%, ±10%, and ±20% of the original (positive
and negative) tones. There were 126 trials overall in the generalization stage.
The acquisition and generalization stages appeared four times consecutively
in a loop, to keep the original tones reinforced and avoid extinction effects.
Data Analysis
Behavioral
We quantified the proportion of correct and incorrect responses in the gener-
alization stage, and individual generalization slopes were measured as the
drop in response rate per 1 Hz of tone (the overall slope of the generalization
curve in the range tested in our paradigm). The slopes were then included in
either one-way ANOVA tests or two-way ANOVAs when both valence (gain
and loss) and group (GAD and controls) factors were analyzed. A two-way
ANOVA was also used to look for differences in learning rates during
acquisition.
Baseline auditory discrimination thresholds (just-noticeable difference
[JND]) were collected from GAD patients (n = 14) and healthy subjects (n =
16) using a two-alternative forced-choice (2AFC) paradigm and an adaptive
‘‘two-down, one-up’’ staircase converging procedure.
To examine the effect of conditioning on detection, we measured thres-
holds using a 2AFC, transformed up-down staircase implemented in the
PSYCHOACOUSTICS toolbox. Each trial included two intervals: a 20 ms
sine tone (the signal) presented within a band of band-pass noise of 300 ms
(400–1,600 Hz) and the band-pass noise only. A different group of healthy sub-
jects (n = 18) had to identify which interval included the tone, which varied in
intensity adaptively, before and after conditioning with monetary outcomes
(gain, loss, neutral). This experimental paradigm was run only on healthy
subjects.
Neuroimaging
Functional images were acquired by T2*-weighted gradient-echo echo-planar
imaging (35 slices, flip angle = 75�, time repetition [TR] = 2,000 ms, time echo
[TE] = 30 ms, voxel size = 3 3 3 3 4 mm) on a 3 T MRI scanner (Tim Trio,
Siemens). Anatomical images were acquired using a T1-weighted MPRAGE
sequence (176 slices, flip angle = 9�, TR = 2,300 ms, TE = 2.98 ms, FOV
256, voxel size 1.0 3 1.0 3 1.1 mm).
We used statistical parametric mapping (SPM8; Wellcome Trust Centre for
Neuroimaging, http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm) for image preprocessing.
Images were realigned to the first volume, unwarped, normalized to a standard
EPI template based on the MNI reference brain, resampled to 2 3 2 3 2 mm
voxels, and spatially smoothed with an isotropic 8 mm FWHM Gaussian
kernel, and for estimation of statistical maps using a general linear model
approach with six rigid-body realignment parameters as nuisance covariates.
All analyses were first conducted using a wide set of a priori regions impli-
cated in emotional learning, emotional modulation, and sensory-auditory rep-
resentation: all PFCs, the striatum (caudate and putamen), auditory cortices
(BA41, BA42, BA21, BA22), insula (BA13), hippocampus, amygdala, and the
thalamus, thresholded at p < 0.05, FWE small volume correction, k > 10.
Analyses were repeated using a whole-brain approach, thresholded at p <
0.05, FWE corrected, k > 10. Anatomical ROIs were defined based on known
anatomical landmarks according to the Talairach Daemon Atlas using the SPM
WFU PickAtlas tool.
To trace valence-related brain regions, regressors were constructed for
conditioning trial types. Regressors were modeled as box-car functions,
from trial onset until the participant’s response, and convolved with the hemo-
dynamic response function. Feedback screens were modeled separately as
1.5 s epochs. Second-level random effects analyses were performed in order
to identify differences in activations between anxiety and healthy control sub-
jects (two-sample t test). To identify brain regions mediating the observed ef-
fect of monetary outcome on the extent of generalization, we added individual
generalization slopes as covariates to the second-level random-effects ana-
lyses of the corresponding contrasts.
A psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis was conducted to identify
regions that show a significant condition-specific difference in functional con-
nectivity with the amygdala. The conditions of interest were gain and loss
acquisition trials. The regressors in the PPI analysis included (1) the activation
time course of the volume of interest (i.e., physiological variable; the blood-ox-
ygen-level-dependent [BOLD] signal); (2) a regressor representing the psycho-
logical variable of interest (i.e., the different experimental conditions); and (3) a
regressor representing the cross product of the previous two (the PPI). The first
two regressors were added as covariates to the model, while the last regressor
was the regressor of interest.
The neural discrimination measurement was based on multivoxel pattern
analysis (in accordance with [23, 52]) and included three steps: (1) individual,
tone-responsive primary auditory cortex and amygdala voxels were identified
for each subject by contrasting tone > baseline during the acquisition phases,
thresholded at p < 0.1 uncorrected and constrained with the respective
anatomical ROI. (2) fMRI data from the generalization phases (independent
of the acquisition phases used for ROI localization) were passed through the
full pre-processing procedure except for normalization and smoothing, to
maintain individual voxel information. (3) fMRI time series data were extracted
for each generalization trial type (3 CSs and 12 other tones), for each voxel
within the individual functional ROIs. Trial-type-specific vectors were con-
structed, consisting of peak BOLD signal intensities of all respective trials

 within a 5-TR window (0–10 s after tone onset), and normalized to baseline (by
subtracting the minimal fMRI activity in the interval between two TRs before
tone onset and one TR before the peak signal). This produced 15 pattern vec-
tors for each CS+ (gain and loss), 12 pattern vectors for CS�, and 84 vectors
for all surrounding tones, the length of which corresponded to the number of
individual functional voxels. Trial-specific vectors were then averaged across
all trials to form mean pattern vectors, and these were used to calculate pair-
wise spatial correlation coefficients between the CS and other tones.
