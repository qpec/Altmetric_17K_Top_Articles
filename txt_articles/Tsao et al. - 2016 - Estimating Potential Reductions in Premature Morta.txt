Objectives.To assess potential reductions in premature mortality that could have been
achieved in 2008 to 2012 if the minimum wage had been $15 per hour in New York City.
Methods. Using the 2008 to 2012 American Community Survey, we performed sim-
ulations to assess how the proportion of low-income residents in each neighborhood
might change with a hypothetical $15 minimum wage under alternative assumptions of
labor market dynamics. We developed an ecological model of premature death to de-
termine the differences between the levels of premature mortality as predicted by the
actual proportions of low-income residents in 2008 to 2012 and the levels predicted by
the proportions of low-income residents under a hypothetical $15 minimum wage.
Results. A $15 minimum wage could have averted 2800 to 5500 premature deaths
between 2008 and 2012 in New York City, representing 4% to 8% of total premature
deaths in that period. Most of these avertable deaths would be realized in lower-income
communities, in which residents are predominantly people of color.
Conclusions. A higher minimum wage may have substantial positive effects on health and
should be considered as an instrument to address health disparities. (Am J Public Health.

T
he 1938 Fair Labor Standard Act
(29 U.S.C.A. § 201 et seq.), which
established a minimum wage in the United
States, declared that its intention was the
“elimination of labor conditions detrimental
to the maintenance of the minimum standards
of living necessary for health, efficiency and
well-being of workers.” The US minimum
wage reached its highest real dollar value in
1968, more than 45 years ago, and the federal
minimum wage was last increased in 2009.
As research on income and health con-
sistently demonstrates that lower income and
poverty are associated with worse health
outcomes and earlier death,1–5 the recent
national advocacy across the United States to
raise the minimum wage as a way of im-
proving the income of the working poor
could also have important health conse-
quences.6–11 In New York City (NYC),
which is among the most expensive places
to live in the United States, the standard
minimum wage is currently $9.00 per hour.12
Recent legislation has established a $15.00 per
hour minimum wage in several municipali-
ties, including San Francisco and Seattle,11
and advocates in NYC are calling for a similar
increase.13
The impact of a $15 minimum wage on
family and neighborhood income depends
critically on the employment responses to
a higher minimum wage. Recent studies
have found a range of responses, from a small
increase to a modest reduction in employ-
ment among low-wage workers following
a minimum wage hike.14–18 Although the
economic impact of increasing the minimum
wage has been the primary focus of debate in
NYC,19 less attention has been given to the
possible health consequences of such a policy,
including the reduction of health inequities.
To fill that gap, we explored the potential
impact of a $15 per hour minimum wage on
all-cause premature mortality among NYC
residents. We used area-based measures of
income and premature mortality to create an
ecological model and explore the reduction in
premature mortality that could have been
achievedfrom2008to2012ifNYC’sminimum
wage had been $15 per hour during that period.
Recognizing the uncertain effects of a higher
minimum wage on the NYC labor market, we
assumed 3 alternative scenarios in the analysis.
METHODS

partment of Health and Mental Hygiene

death in each of NYC’s 59 community dis-

 can vary,21 the NYC Department of Health
and Mental Hygiene has begun to focus on
health inequities across community districts
because, with their community boards,
community districts represent the most local
level of government and are a critical area for
community planning and decision-making.
Our key predictor of interest was the pro-
portion of residents who were low income—
defined as having a family income below
200% of the 2012 federal poverty level de-
termined by the US Department of Health
and Human Services, which is generally
considered a factor for income-related health
disparities—at the community district level.
We derived this information from American
Community Survey data collected from 2008
to 2012.22 To assess the potential effects of
a higher minimum wage on neighborhood
income, we used individual-level data to
simulate the family income for each survey
respondent under 3 different scenarios and
then aggregated individual-level information
to determine the proportion of residents with
low-income status in a community district.
Specifically, we used the 2012 American
Community Survey 5-year Public Use
Microdata Sample to identify survey re-
spondents in each community district who
were low income as well as those who earned
less than $15 per hour. We derived a re-
spondent’s family income by summing the
total incomes of all members in the re-
spondent’s family. If a respondent’s family
income fell below 200% of the 2012 federal
poverty level on the basis of family size, we
categorized the respondent as having low
income. We imputed the hourly wage by
dividing annual labor earnings for a re-
spondent by the product of the number of
hours worked in the past week and the
number of weeks worked in the past year.
Analytic Plan
We conducted our study in 3 stages. First,
we performed an ecological analysis of pre-
mature death in NYC using linear regression
techniques weighted by the size of the
neighborhood population younger than 65
years to determine whether there was an
independent association between the crude
rate of premature death and the proportion of
residents who were low income. The de-
pendent variable in the model was the crude
rate of premature death in a community district
from 2008 to 2012, including only deaths
among NYC residents that occurred in NYC.
Because the greatest disparities in mortality
associated with socioeconomic status occur
between ages 45 and 65 years,1,23 a cutpoint
of 65 years may yield wider variability in
premature mortality among neighborhoods;
therefore, we used 65 years instead of the
standard 75 years as the cutpoint for pre-
mature mortality. Additionally, using age 65
years as a cutpoint is particularly appropriate
for examining the potential impact of a higher
minimum wage because only the working
age population is likely to be affected by such
a policy change. The independent variables
included in our regression were the pro-
portion of residents younger than 65 years
who were low income as our key predictor
of interest; control variables were the pro-
portions of residents younger than 65 years
who were women, aged 45 years or older,
foreign-born, non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic,
Asian, and other race, as well as those who
were aged 25 years and older without a col-
lege education.
Second, we conducted simulations to as-
sess the impact of a $15 minimum wage on the
proportions of low-income residents in NYC
neighborhoods under 3 different assumptions
of labor market dynamics.
As the minimum wage in NYC ranged
from $7.15 to $7.25 per hour between 2008
and 2012, in the first scenario we assumed that
a higher minimum wage would raise the
hourly wage of the non–self-employed
earning $7.15 to $14.99 to $15.00. Addi-
tionally, we assumed that the level of em-
ployment would remain constant with
a higher minimum wage.15,16
In the second scenario, we followed an
approach similar to that adopted in a previous
study by assuming that a $15.00 minimum
wage would create spillover effects by raising
the hourly wage of the non–self-employed
earning near the new minimum, even if not
required bylaw, sothat the hourly wageof the
non–self-employed earning $7.15 to $15.99
increased to $15.00 to $16.00 and the non–
self-employed earning $6.15 to $7.14 in-
creased to $6.16 to $14.99.24 Again, in this
scenario we assumed employment would
remain constant.
In the third scenario, we assumed that
a higher minimum wage would not have
spillover effects and would result in a loss
of employment for 15% of the non–self-
employed earning $7.15 to $15.00 per
hour.17,18 We derived this figure from pre-
vious studies that found employment re-
ductions associated with a higher minimum
wage, but because thereis limited evidence on
who may lose employment among those
studies, we assumed that a random selection of
15% of the non–self-employed workers
earning $7.15 to $15.00 hourly would lose
their jobs owing to a higher minimum wage.
In all 3 scenarios, we assumed that the
number of hours worked for individuals who
do not experience a job loss would remain the
same25,26 and that the wages of self-employed
individuals would not change as a result of
a higher minimum wage.
For the final part of this analysis, we used
the ecological model of premature death to
determine the differences between the levels
of premature mortality predicted by the actual
proportions of low-income residents in 2008
to 2012 and the levels predicted by the
proportions of low-income residents under
a hypothetical $15 minimum wage. These
differences represent the potential reductions
in premature mortality owing to a $15
minimum wage. We ran this model using the
3 sets of figures derived from the simulations
to estimate the possible range of results.
Income as a Proxy for Multiple
Determinants of Health
NYC data showed that lower income was
associated with a wide range of health risk
factors, such as physical inactivity, poor nu-
trition, obesity, smoking, depression, and
reduced health access.27 Additionally,
a lack of financial resources may adversely
affect the management of chronic diseases
and the prevention or treatment of their
complications.28
We assumed that any increases in income
stemming from a higher minimum wage
would reduce the prevalence of these risk
factors for health, which might lead to
fewer premature deaths, although research
has shown that increased income may
also reduce mortality risk through other
mechanisms.29 In other words, income serves
as a proxy in the model for all income-related
factors that would vary with an increase
in minimum wage to $15 per hour.

 RESULTS
Table 1 shows the means for the variables
included in the ecological model of premature
death stratified by the proportion of low-
income population in the neighborhood. It can
be discerned that there is a neighborhood
income gradient in NYC premature mortality:
the premature death rate increased with the
proportion of low-income population in the
neighborhood. The crude rate of premature
death was nearly twice as high in community
districts with the highest proportions of low-
income population as in those with the lowest
proportions of low-income population (251 vs
128 per 100000). A large low-income
population, however, was not the only dis-
tinguishing factor for neighborhoods with high
premature death rates. Neighborhoods with
high premature death rates also had substantially
greater proportions of Hispanics, non-Hispanic
Blacks, and residents without college education.
The weighted linear regression estimates
for the ecological model of premature death
in NYC are presented in Table 2. It is worth
noting that almost 90% of the variation in the
crude premature death rates among NYC
community districts is accounted for by the
few neighborhood-level variables included in
the model (R2 =0.87), suggesting that social
determinants exert a powerful influence on the
health outcomes of NYC residents. After
controlling for neighborhood demographic
characteristics, the crude premature death rate
was significantly associated with the proportion
of low-income population. Specifically, a 1%
increase in the low-income population was
associated with almost 3 additional premature
deaths per 100 000 community district resi-
dents. The proportion of low-income pop-
ulation and the crude premature death rate for
each community district and the relationship
between these 2 variables as estimated by the
model are plotted in Figure 1.
To understand the significance of the as-
sociation between income and premature
mortality, we conducted the thought experi-
ment of equalizing the proportions of low-
income residents across the poorest and richest
community districts while holding other fac-
tors in the model constant. The differences in
the proportions of low-income residents and
premature mortality rates as predicted by the
model are 44% and 108 per 100 000, re-
spectively, between the community districts
with the highest and lowest proportions of
low-income population. The model estimates
suggest that the gap in predicted premature
mortality rates would disappear in our thought
experiment and successful antipoverty mea-
sures may have the potential to result in
substantial health benefits for NYC residents.
The effects of an increase in minimum
wage to $15 per hour on the proportions of
low-income residents in community districts
and NYC are shown in Table 3. In the
most optimistic scenario, in which a higher
minimum wage would create spillover effects
and result in no employment loss, the pro-
portion of the NYC population younger
than 65 years who were low income would
decrease from 39.7% to 34.4%. In this sce-
nario, 1.3 million low-income NYC residents
younger than 65 years would realize an av-
erage annual increase of almost $10 000 in
family income, from $26 700 to $36 100.
In the pessimistic scenario, in which a $15
minimum wage causes a 15% reduction in
employment among the non–self-employed
earning $7.15 to $15.00 per hour, the de-
crease in the proportion of the population
younger than 65 years who were low income
would be more modest, from 39.7% to
37.1%. In all 3 scenarios, a higher minimum
wage would lower the proportion of the
low-income population by a greater extent in
the lower-income than in the higher-income
neighborhoods.
The impact of a $15 minimum wage on
crude premature death rates is presented in
Table 3. A $15 minimum wage could reduce
the premature death rate in NYC by as much
as 15 per 100 000 in the most optimistic
scenario. The total number of NYC pre-
mature deaths in 2008 to 2012 was
approximately 70 000. A reduction in the
crude rate of 15 per 100 000 would translate
into approximately 5500 fewer predicted
premature deaths from 2008 to 2012, rep-
resenting 8% of the total premature deaths
in NYC over the study period.
Even in the pessimistic scenario, which
resulted in a decrease in employment rates,
a $15 minimum wage could reduce the crude
premature death rate in NYC by nearly 8 per
100 000, translating into almost 2800 fewer
premature deaths and 4% of the total number
of premature deaths in 2008 to 2012. As
low-income neighborhoods would experi-
ence much larger reductions in the premature
death rate in all 3 scenarios, most of the
avertable deaths stemming from a $15

 minimum wage would be realized in these
low-income communities, contributing to
a narrowing of health inequities across the city.
DISCUSSION
Using community-level income and
mortality data from 2008 to 2012, we esti-
mated the potential impact a hypothetical $15
minimum wage would have had in NYC
during that 5-year period. Our analysis sug-
gests that a minimum wage of $15 per hour
would reduce premature deaths, averting as
many as 5500 deaths over 5 years. Even if
wage increases led to modest job losses, as
many as 2800 deaths could be averted in this
period. More than a million low-income and
poor residents might see a $10 000 boost in
family income on average each year, and
about 400 000 could move up from below
200% of the federal poverty level.
Among households with less than 80% of
the NYC median household income, ap-
proximately 60% were rent burdened (paying
more than 30% of income in rent and utility
costs), and more than one third were severely
rent burdened (paying more than 50% of
income in rent and utility costs). The severely
rent-burdened households in that income
category made up more than 90% of all se-
verely rent-burdened households in NYC.30
Being burdened by such a high rent may lead
to compromises in quality of housing, nu-
trition and food security, health care and
prescription medications, and other health-
promoting inputs. An increase of $10 000 in
income from a $15 minimum wage may
particularly help severely rent-burdened
families improve their health.
Our ecological model found that holding
other neighborhood factors constant, income
difference may account for the gap in pre-
mature death rates between the richest and
poorest communities in NYC. For example,
the rate of premature death in Central Harlem,
where almost 30% of residents live below the
federal poverty level, is almost 4 times higher
than is that in the financial district, where only
8% live in poverty. A $15 minimum wage
would, therefore, have the greatest health
benefit for residents in high-poverty com-
munities, who are predominantly people of
color, although premature deaths would be
averted in all communities and among people
of all races and ethnicities across NYC. Of
course the association between premature
mortality and neighborhood income may re-
flect cumulative effects of low neighborhood
income on health over a long period of time.
Hence, caution is needed in interpreting the
study findings, and one should not necessarily
expect to see an immediate reduction in
premature death of the magnitude we esti-
mated in our analysis if minimum wage were
raised to $15 per hour in NYC.
Policy Implications
Until recently, state and local health de-
partments have generally not taken positions
on minimum wage debates, although the
relationship between income and health has
long been acknowledged. This analysis adds
to a growing body of work by health de-
partments to resurrect the centrality of
minimum wages to population health. For
example, the San Francisco, California,
Health Department adopted “living wages” as
essential to good health. Rajiv Bhatia et al.
performed analyses to show that a minimum
wage would decrease the risk of premature
death by 5% for adults aged 24 to 44 years
living in households with an income of about
$20 000.6 Analyses of the health impact of
living wage ordinances have also been done in
Los Angeles, California.7 A more recent
analysis by Human Impact Partners suggests
that nearly 400 premature deaths among
low-wage Californians would be averted.9
Some departments have taken these
arguments to the legislature. In Minnesota,

 Edward Ehlinger, the state health commis-
sioner, made it a priority to educate legislators
about the health benefits of the minimum
wage bill. He declared its successful passage in
2014 as the greatest legislative accomplish-
ment of his tenure, noting, “Even the tobacco
tax increase. . . is not as powerful as the
minimum wage increase.”10(p1)
Our analysis may help increase apprecia-
tion for the potential health impact of not
only minimum wage but also policies as di-
verse as those directed at education, labor, and
transportation among legislators and the
general public.
Strengths and Limitations
This study has several strengths. Previous
analyses of the health impact of a higher
minimum wage generally relied on older,
national estimates,6,7,9 which may not be
universally applicable to all localities in recent
times.Thisisbecausestudies haveshown wide
variability in premature mortality both across
geography and over time4,31 and a non-
constant association between income and
mortality across periods.32 Our analysis was on
the basis of contemporary data, although it
was specific to NYC. Additionally, as our
units of analysis were neighborhoods instead
of individuals, we were able to focus on the
ecological dimensions of social and economic
factors on health.33 Lastly, our approach of
triangulating local health data with American
Community Survey Public Use Microdata,
which are the highest quality and most de-
tailed socioeconomic data available, at the
community level could be extended to assess
a wide range of policies that may influence
health through the social determinants.
Although using income mortality esti-
mates from older, national studies may be less
appropriate to our analysis, it would be in-
structive to compare our results, which were
derived from an ecological model, with those
from the conventional approach, which is
grounded on individual-level national stud-
ies.6,7,9 We performed an analysis using the
conventional approach and found that a $15
minimum wage would still reduce premature
mortality, albeit at a lower level. For example,
in the scenario in which a higher minimum
wage would createneither spillover effects nor
employment loss, a $15 minimum wage
would have averted more than 1300 pre-
mature deaths among NYC residents aged
25 to 64 years from 2008 to 2012.
This study also has many limitations. First,
the ecological model did not include all
health-influencing factors that are potentially
correlated with neighborhood income be-
cause of concerns that many of these factors
may vary with income as the minimum wage
increases. Nonetheless, as a robustness check,
we ran the model with additional controls,
including unemployment rate, noninsurance
rate, air quality, and the proportions of adults
who were smokers, eating fruits and vege-
tables regularly, physically active, and obese,
and we obtained very similar results.
Although our estimates appear to be robust,
we would like to acknowledge that some
of the omitted income-related factors, such
as green space, chronic disease states, and
certain health-producing institutions or in-
frastructure, may not accompany an increase
in minimum wage, and omission of any such
factors could have biased our estimates.
Second, because mortality is a function of
cumulative experiences over the life course,
in our analysis we implicitly assumed that
relative neighborhood income at a point in
time correlates fairly well with long-term
relative neighborhood income. Although this
assumption may be reasonable, it is a potential
weakness in our analysis.
Third, the association between premature
mortality and the proportion of low-income
population may not reflect a causal relation-
ship. However, it is reasonable to assume that
neighborhood income may indeed have
a causal impact on premature mortality in
NYC. Our results are consistent with the
pervasive robust links found between pre-
mature mortality and low life expectancy and
poverty and low income found in numerous
other studies.1–5,31,32,34,35 It seems unlikely for
such a relationship to persist among multiple
populations and over time unless there is an
underlying causal mechanism. Additionally,
we performed our analysis at a smaller geo-
graphical level, namely Neighborhood Tab-
ulation Areas,36,37 which are aggregations of
census tracts that are subsets of Public Use
Microdata Areas, and the direction and

Note. We defined low income as family income < 200% of the federal poverty level according to the US Department of Health and Human Services.
aScenario 1 assumes that a higher minimum wage would create neither spillover nor employment effects. Scenario 2 assumes that a higher minimum wage
would result in spillover effects but no employment effects. Scenario 3 assumes that a higher minimum wage would result in no spillover effects and
a 15% reduction in employment for non–self-employed workers earning between $7.15 and $15.00 per hour.
bWe derived the proportions of low-income population for New York City in all scenarios using respondent-level data from the American Community Survey; we
calculated the premature death rates for New York City in all scenarios as the averages of community district premature death rates.

 magnitudeofthecoefficientforthe proportion
of low-income population was similar.
Finally, whereas our 3 simulations used
a range of estimates derived from recent
studies that examined the effects of minimum
wage hikes legislated across jurisdictions and
over time, an increase in minimum wage to
$15 per hour would be a substantially larger
increase than would the minimum wage hikes
that havetaken placehistorically.Asa result, its
potential impact may not be analogous. And
we did not explicitly model the potential
impact of increased income on the eligibility
for entitlements. However, it should be noted
that in the context of our cross-sectional
ecological model, a $15 minimum wage
would reduce premature death rates of
lower-income neighborhoods by essentially
lowering the proportions of low-income
population in these neighborhoods to the
prevailing levels in higher-income neigh-
borhoods while controlling for differences in
other demographic characteristics. Because
thevast majorityof residents inhigher-income
neighborhoods were already ineligible for
entitlements, we by and large implicitly
accountedfor thepotential loss ofentitlements
by families experiencing increased family
income owing to a higher minimum
wage.
