Abstract
The role of vitamin D in osteomineral metabolism is well known. Several studies have 
suggested its action on different biological mechanisms, such as nociceptive sensitivity 
and sleep–wake cycle modulation. Sleep is an important biological process regulated 
by different regions of the central nervous system, mainly the hypothalamus, in 
combination with several neurotransmitters. Pain, which can be classified as nociceptive, 
neuropathic and psychological, is regulated by both the central and peripheral nervous 
systems. In the peripheral nervous system, the immune system participates in the 
inflammatory process that contributes to hyperalgesia. Sleep deprivation is an important 
condition related to hyperalgesia, and recently it has also been associated with vitamin 
D. Poor sleep efficiency and sleep disorders have been shown to have an important role 
in hyperalgesia, and be associated with different vitamin D values. Vitamin D has been 
inversely correlated with painful manifestations, such as fibromyalgia and rheumatic 
diseases. Studies have demonstrated a possible action of vitamin D in the regulatory 
mechanisms of both sleep and pain. The supplementation of vitamin D associated with 
good sleep hygiene may have a therapeutic role, not only in sleep disorders but also in 
the prevention and treatment of chronic pain conditions.
Introduction
The musculoskeletal benefits of vitamin D are widely 
known: they promote the calcification of bone matrix 
and increase the absorption of calcium and phosphate in 
the intestine. Vitamin D deficiency can cause rickets in 
children and osteomalacia in adults. It also contributes to 
bone frailty and consequent fracture in the elderly.
The endogenous synthesis of vitamin D occurs in 
the epidermis from the precursor 7-dehydrocholesterol 
(7-DHC) through ultraviolet B radiation (wavelengths 
between 290 and 315 
nm). Vitamin D2 (ergosterol) 
and vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) can be obtained from 
vegetable and animal sources, such as shiitake mushrooms 
and salmon, respectively (Holick & Chen 2008, IOM 
2011). When both ergosterol and cholecalciferol reach 
the liver and kidney through circulation, two consecutive 
hydroxylations 
occur 
mediated 
by 
cytochrome 
(CYP) P450. In the kidney, 25-hydroxyvitamin D 
(25OHD) is converted to its metabolically active form: 
1-α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, also known as calcitriol 
(1,25(OH)2D). This active molecule (1,25(OH)2D) can 
also be produced in different cells and tissues, such as 
skin, colon, placenta and prostate (Holick & Chen 2008, 
EFSA 2016). Calcitriol binds to the vitamin D receptor 
(VDR), a transcription factor that translocates to the cell 
nucleus, in which it is heterodimerized with the retinoid 
X receptor (RXR). Then, the calcitriol-VDR-RXR complex 
couples to a specific sequence of DNA known as the 
vitamin D response element (VDRE), which is associated

with promoters of several target genes and co-activator 
molecules (Holick et al. 2011).
Many conditions interfere with the endogenous 
synthesis of vitamin D. The lower the amount of sunlight, 
the lower the endogenous vitamin D production. Age is 
also relevant, but not determinant to the reduction of 7 
DHC production due to increased thickening of the skin 
in elderly individuals (Need et al. 1993, Holick & Chen 
2008). Additionally, skin pigmentation can modulate 
the synthesis of vitamin D, since the amount of melanin 
restricts the radiation of photons that are necessary for its 
endogenous production. Consequently, dark/black skin 
individuals need longer exposure to the sun to get optimal 
levels of vitamin D (Hagenau et al. 2009, Gordon et al. 
2012, Correia et al. 2014).
Vitamin D status is based on the serum levels of 
25OHD, the metabolite found in the human body 
in higher concentration. Currently, there is a debate 
about the optimal reference value of vitamin D, which 
is primarily based on bone health parameters. Different 
scientific committees’ panels indicate that 25OHD 
serum levels lower than 20 
ng/mL are appropriate for 
good health in the general population (IOM 2011, EFSA 
2016, SACN 2016). On the other hand, the Endocrine 
Practice Guideline suggests a screening in groups at 
risk for vitamin D deficiency (Holick et al. 2011). In 
this guideline, individuals with 25OHD serum levels of 
20 
ng/mL are considered as deficient for vitamin D, while 
serum levels above 30 
ng/mL are considered sufficient to 
provide health benefits (Holick et al. 2011). Manson and 
colleagues (Manson et al. 2016) have addressed this issue 
by emphasizing that the suggested values for 25OHD 
sufficiency of >30 
ng/mL are due to a misinterpretation 
and misunderstanding of the reference value indicated by 
the IOM. For clinical practice, it is important to establish 
a cut-off point. However, this requires more standardized 
studies, since most experimental designs available in the 
literature were not well controlled for confounders and 
based solely on bone health.
25OHD serum levels have been associated with 
several comorbidities such as infectious, autoimmune and 
neurological diseases, as well as neuromuscular disorders, 
which can lead to increased pain sensitivity (Dhesi et al. 
2002, Orme et al. 2013, Lachmann et al. 2015). Regarding 
the mechanisms of pain sensitization, vitamin D seems 
to stimulate anti-inflammatory processes in some 
cases and thus to relieve the painful sensation of many 
diseases (Adorini & Penna 2008, Osunkwo et al. 2011, Le 
Goaziou et al. 2014). It is important to mention that the 
anti-inflammatory actions on pain conditions are not 
specific for vitamin D. Recently, researchers have suggested 
the participation of vitamin D in regulatory mechanisms 
of sleep–wake cycle, based on the evidence suggesting 
that the reduction of this vitamin is also associated with 
sleep disorders (McCarty et al. 2012, Mete et al. 2013, 
Çakır et al. 2015, Kerley et al. 2016).
This proposed ability of vitamin D to act on both the 
sleep–wake cycle and the nociceptive process may be due to 
the fact that they share some neurotransmitters in similar 
pathways. In this review, we aim to explore the current 
knowledge about the association between sleep and pain 
and to consider the role that vitamin D may play in this 
relationship. Finally, we will highlight new perspectives 
about the potential applicability vitamin D may have in 
sleep disorders and chronic painful conditions.
Vitamin D and sleep
Sleep regulation
Sleep is a complex physiological state, and although 
often thought as an inactivity period, it comprises a 
period of intense metabolic activity. Its function is still 
not fully understood, although it is known that this 
biological phenomenon participates in several processes, 
e.g., learning, consolidation of memory, inflammation, 
and metabolic disorders, being essential to good mental 
and physical health (Walker & Stickgold 2004, Van 
Cauter et al. 2008, Hirotsu et al. 2012, Ruiz et al. 2012, 
Garcia et al. 2013, Davis et al. 2017).
Sleep is classified into the rapid eye movement 
(REM) stage, also known as paradoxical sleep, and the 
non-REM (NREM) or slow-wave sleep stage. NREM sleep 
is characterized by cortical synchronization, muscular 
hypotonia and endocrine regulation. REM sleep presents 
cortical desynchronization, muscle atonia, rapid eye 
movements and dream activity (Jouvet 1967, Carskadon 
& Dement 2017).
The sleep–wake cycle is modulated by different 
regions of the central nervous system (CNS). Its main 
regulation occurs in the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus 
(VLPO) of the hypothalamus through interaction with 
circadian and homeostatic factors. A set of neurons from 
the suprachiasmatic nucleus is activated by circadian 
influences such as absence and/or presence of light, 
while hypnogenic homeostatic factors such as adenosine 
accumulation in the forebrain are induced by prolonged 
wakefulness or decreased by sleep (Saper et al. 2005). 
Another important factor in the regulation of sleep is 
the presence of melatonin, an endogenous hormone

produced by the pineal gland and responsible for the 
regulation of circadian rhythms. The absence of light 
stimulates melatonin production, leading to sleep 
facilitation. During the daytime, the light stimulus is 
processed by the retina and sent to the suprachiasmatic 
nucleus, inhibiting melatonin synthesis and promoting 
wakefulness (McArthur et al. 1991, Cajochen et al. 2003).
During wakefulness, due to its higher behavioral 
complexity, numerous neural systems are activated in 
the brainstem reticular formation, which is a network 
of cells and fibers that project throughout the cerebral 
cortex, producing cortical activity and controlling the 
waking state (Jones 2011). Acetylcholine, norepinephrine, 
histamine and hypocretin neurotransmitters participate 
in the cortical activation process, while dopamine and 
serotonin participate in both cortical and behavioral 
activation. Conversely, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), 
an inhibitory neurotransmitter, is associated with 
sleep. From the VLPO, neuronal GABAergic projections 
inhibit 
the 
release 
of 
hypocretin, 
acetylcholine, 
norepinephrine, serotonin and dopamine, resulting in 
brain synchronization. During REM sleep, however, there 
is continued inhibition of these neurotransmitters, except 
for acetylcholine, which provides cortical activity during 
REM sleep (España & Scammell 2011).
The advance of technology and increased urbaniza-
tion over the 20th and 21st centuries caused the 
suppression of melatonin synthesis by artificial light 
produced at night. This has led to extended periods of 
wakefulness and sleep curtailment. Sleep deprivation 
induced by exposure to artificial light causes several 
impairments in the regulation of biological rhythms, 
cognition and brain development, leading to long-term 
negative impacts on quality of life (Thomas et al. 2000, 
Durmer & Dinges 2005, Tufik et al. 2009).
The most common sleep disorders in the general 
population are obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and 
insomnia, followed by others of lower prevalence such 
as sleep-related movement disorders, parasomnias and 
central hypersomnolence disorders. OSA is a sleep 
disordered breathing condition that affects one-third of 
the general population and is characterized by complete 
or partial obstruction of the upper airways resulting 
in a higher apnea–hypopnea index (AHI>15), snoring, 
morning headaches and dry mouth (Tufik et al. 2010). 
Risk factors for OSA include obesity and being male and 
older. The cardiovascular system is also impaired in OSA 
due to intermittent hypoxia, sleep fragmentation and 
reduction of intrathoracic pressure. This condition may 
lead to vascular injury contributing to the increase of 
systemic blood pressure (Drager et al. 2013, Franklin & 
Lindberg 2015).
Insomnia is characterized by a difficulty in initiating 
and/or maintaining sleep or early awakening with a 
frequency of more than 3 times a week over a period of 
3 months (ICSD-3, 2014), and affects around 15–45% 
of the general population. Individuals with insomnia 
frequently have a non-restorative sleep and may 
present early awakenings. Among the predisposing and 
risk factors are female gender, anxiety and depression 
(Castro et al. 2013).
Vitamin D and sleep
The recent interest in the role of vitamin D as a sleep 
modulator is based on studies in both animal models 
and humans, indicating the neuronal expression of 
CYP27B1 and VDR in different brain areas, especially 
in regions that also regulate the sleep–wake cycle, such 
as the hypothalamus (Stumpf & O’Brien 1987, Pérez-
Fernandez et al. 1997, Prüfer et al. 1999, Eyles et al. 
2005, 2014).
The association between sleep disorders and 25OHD 
values has increased in the last decade (Andersen & Tufik 
2012, Bozkurt et al. 2012, Kheirandish-Gozal et al. 2014, 
McCarty et al. 2014, de Oliveira et al. 2015, Evatt 2015). 
The possible mechanisms involved in this association are 
not clear, suggesting that additional studies are required to 
understand the potential role of vitamin D in physiological 
sleep mechanisms. Table 1 summarizes the current findings 
from the clinical literature. One of the first studies showed 
a significant association between excessive daytime 
sleepiness and serum values of 25OHD <20 
ng/mL only 
in black individuals (McCarty et al. 2012). Valtueña et al. 
(2013) found that lower levels of 25OHD concentrations 
were associated with shorter sleep duration (<8 
h) in 
female teenagers. In this study, sleep duration was assessed 
by self-administered questionnaires, which only provide 
subjective information about the sleep pattern of subjects. 
Recently, other studies have evaluated the relationship 
between serum 25OHD levels and sleep using objective 
parameters. Low 25OHD serum levels (<30 
ng/mL) were 
associated with shorter sleep duration (<5 
h) measured 
by actigraphy among men (Massa et al. 2015). Similarly, 
Bertisch et al. (2015) reported that shorter sleep duration 
(373.3 
± 
80.7 
min) measured by polysomnography was 
significantly associated with 25OHD serum levels lower 
than 20 
ng/mL, while a lower proportion of REM sleep 
was weakly correlated with 25OHD values between 20 
and 29 
ng/mL. In addition, a study using actigraphy in

male forensic patients demonstrated that sleep latency 
decreased in the group who was submitted to a fish-
enriched diet compared to the control group. Moreover, 
25OHD serum levels increased with fish consumption, 
and a positive correlation between vitamin D and sleep 
efficiency was found (Hansen et al. 2014). It is important to 
highlight the heterogeneous characteristics of the sample 
in this study, such as age, gender and the presence of 
comorbidities, which hamper the establishment of a clear 
relationship between vitamin D and sleep maintenance.
Other studies have demonstrated that in patients 
with OSA, the higher the body mass index (BMI) and 
AHI, the lower the 25OHD levels (Mete et al. 2013, 
Kerley et al. 2016). Additionally, Goswami and coworkers 
(2016) found that BMI and neck circumference could be 
a confounding factor in the association observed between 
25OHD serum levels <20 
ng/mL and some risk factors for 
OSA. A further study revealed that the use of continuous 
positive airway pressure (CPAP), the gold standard for 
OSA treatment, promoted increased levels of 25OHD 
(from 19.21 
± 
9.45 
ng/mL to 21.03 
± 
9.50 
ng/mL) (Table 1) 
in men with OSA after 7 days of CPAP use (Liguori et al. 
2015). The CPAP therapy was also effective in increasing 
25OHD serum concentrations from 16.05 
± 
7.74 
ng/mL 
to 25.73 
± 
12.91 
ng/mL after 1 year of treatment in both 
obese and non-obese OSA patients (Liguori et al. 2016). 
The increase in serum 25OHD levels and decrease in both 
sleepiness and AHI were mainly observed in the obese 
patients compared to non-obese OSA men treated with 
CPAP. A pilot study assessing Caucasian OSA individuals 
submitted to cholecalciferol supplementation (4000 
IU/
day) during 15 weeks (Kerley et al. 2017) showed an 
increase in 25OHD serum levels in the supplemented group 
vs 
placebo 
(100.8 
± 
39.9 
nmol/L 
× 
43.0 
± 
21.4 
nmol/L, 
respectively), and a decrease in metabolic parameters 
such as low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and lipoprotein-
associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2). Some subjects 
from both groups used CPAP, but the data were not 
controlled, hampering the interpretation about the 
benefits of the supplementation since there is current 
evidence that CPAP use can increase 25OHD levels 
(Liguori et al. 2015).
In pediatric patients, the clinical condition is similar. 
Obese children present lower serum levels of 25OHD 
(83.6 
± 
19.2 
ng/mL) compared to non-obese children 
(97.1 
± 
20.9 
ng/mL); and obese children with OSA 
have lower 25OHD levels than obese children without 
OSA (Kheirandish-Gozal 2014). Assessing the risk of 
developing OSA using the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index 
(PSQI) questionnaire, Ozgurhan and coworkers (2016) 
found that children of both sexes with serum 25OHD 
levels ranging 13.10 
± 
4.02 
ng/mL had a higher risk of 
developing OSA than the control group (27.12 
± 
5.63 
ng/
mL). The group at high risk of developing OSA presented 
a higher BMI compared to those at low risk.
Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a sleep-related 
movement disorder that has also been linked to 
lower levels of vitamin D. An urge to move the legs 
characterizes this syndrome, mainly during the end of 
the day, which ameliorates with movement and whose 
physiopathology is associated with a possible dysfunction 
in dopaminergic neurotransmission. RLS affects sleep 
quality by increasing both sleep latency and daytime 
sleepiness. Using the PSQI questionnaire, RLS was found 
to be more frequent in individuals with serum 25OHD 
levels <20 
ng/mL compared to controls (serum 25OHD 
>20 
ng/mL) (Çakır et al. 2015) (Table 1). Vitamin D 
supplementation 
(28,000 
IU/week; 
200,000/month) 
showed a decrease in RLS severity in patients compared 
to their baseline (serum 25OHD at baseline: 21.7 
nmol/L 
(13.45–57.4); serum 25OHD after supplementation: 
61.8 
nmol/L (42.58–95.9)) (Table 1) (Wali et al. 2015). 
1,25(OH)2D acts on dopaminergic neurons and its in vitro 
action increases the expression of N-cadherin, a molecule 
that participates in the neurogenesis of dopaminergic 
neurons and that possibly regulates the expression of 
tyrosine hydroxylase enzyme, a rate-limiting molecule in 
the dopamine synthesis pathway (Cui et al. 2013, 2015, 
Jiang et al. 2014a,b).
In individuals diagnosed with narcolepsy with 
cataplexy, a central hypersomnolence disorder, the serum 
25OHD levels were lower compared to individuals without 
the disease (59.45 
nmol/L 
× 
74.73 
nmol/L, respectively) 
(Table 1) (Carlander et al. 2011). Recently, Dauvilliers and 
coworkers (2017) did not find any association between 
narcolepsy individuals (77.46 (21.10–209.9) 
nmol/L) and 
serum 25OHD levels <20 
ng/mL compared to the control 
group (77.21 (3.73–437.25) 
nmol/L). Narcolepsy is a sleep 
disorder characterized by excessive sleepiness that can be 
or not associated with cataplexy (reduced muscle tonus 
without loss of consciousness) and hallucinations. The

questionnaire. However, another randomized study 
reported cholecalciferol supplementation (4000 
IU/day 
for 12 weeks) benefitted sleep (Table 1) in chronic urticaria 
patients. The authors found a trend of improvement 
in sleep quality in the high-vitamin D supplemented 
group compared to the low-vitamin D supplemented one 
(600 
IU/day) (Rorie et al. 2014). The different designs of 
both studies make it difficult to conclude whether vitamin 
D supplementation has beneficial effects on sleep quality.
Vitamin D and pain
Pain regulation
According to the International Association for the 
Study of Pain (IASP), pain is an unpleasant sensory and 
emotional experience associated with actual or potential 
tissue damage or described in terms of such damage (IASP 
1994). It can be classified into nociceptive, originating in 
the mechanical, thermal or chemical nociceptors (sensory 
neurons) of the physical area in which the injury occurs; 
neuropathic, caused by injury or disease of the nervous 
system; or psychological, from an emotional origin. Acute 
pain comes from inflammation or tissue damage and is 
related to tissue repair and the healing process. Chronic 
pain persists for the period of injury, causing damage to 
the individual’s quality of life (Schaible & Richter 2004).
The most important nerve centers responsible for the 
transmission of nociceptive information are the thalamus, 
midbrain, limbic system and reticular formation. The 
nociception process consists of 3 stages: stimulus 
transduction by first-order neurons of the spinal cord, 
where neurotransmitters such as glutamate, substance 
P and calcitonin are released and activate second-order 
neurons. These, in turn, transmit information to the 
thalamus, where the pain sensitivity occurs. Third-order 
neurons connect the thalamus to the cortex, activating it 
and resulting in pain perception (Schaible & Richter 2004, 
Klaumann et al. 2008).
Several neurotransmitters play a role in the pain 
sensitization process. Norepinephrine, dopamine and 
serotonin modulate the descending pain pathway by 
inhibition or excitation of their target receptors. Nitric 
oxide acts on nociceptive sensitivity (Meller & Gebhart 
1993, Millan 2002). Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) contributes 
to inflammatory pain (Kawabata 2011).
Another important component of pain mechanism 
is the immune system. Because of injury, inflammation 
of the damaged tissue may cause hyperalgesia. Activation 
of macrophages in the damaged peripheral tissues results 
in the release of proinflammatory cytokines, such as 
tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1 beta 
(IL-1β), neuronal growth factor (NGF), nitric oxide and 
PGE2. Neutrophils are also recruited in this process by 
inflammation-producing substances such as cytokines 
and chemokines. The accumulation of these cells in 
inflammatory processes leads to opioid expression, with 
antinociceptive effects (Marchand et al. 2005, Ren & 
Dubner 2010, Shipton & Shipton 2015).
In the last decades, studies have suggested the action 
of the active form of vitamin D (1,25OH2D) in several 
cell types of the immune system. It acts in Th2 cells 
by increasing the synthesis of interleukin-4 (IL-4) and 
transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) (Deluca & Cantorna 
2001). It is known that TGF-β decreases the expression of 
proinflammatory cytokines, such as interferon-γ (IFN-γ), 
IL-1 and TNF-α. Both TGF-β and IL-4 are found in microglial 
cells (Garcion et al. 2002). Vitamin D inhibits the action of 
PGE2 by inhibiting its precursor, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-
2) (Moreno et al. 2006). Finally, studies have shown that 
1,25(OH)2D precludes the synthesis of inducible nitric 
oxide synthase (iNOS), an enzyme that produces large 
amounts of nitric oxide when stimulated (Garcion et al. 
2002). These regulatory pathways are involved in 
pain sensitization and 1,25(OH)2D appears to regulate 
important molecules involved in this process, suggesting 
it has a potential neuro-immunomodulatory action.
Vitamin D and pain
Different anatomical regions may be the targets of 
musculoskeletal pain such as the lower limbs (legs and 
knees) and back. This chronic pain condition causes 
socioeconomic and psychological harms. Moreover, the 
cause of these disorders is often associated with several 
factors such as age, gender, diet and psychological status 
(McBeth & Jones 2007). Researchers have shown that 
women with 25OHD serum levels <20 
ng/mL have a 
higher chance of developing pain (Table 2) (Hicks et al. 
2008, Heidari et al. 2010). Several studies have indicated 
that vitamin D supplementation (Table 2) is effective 
in reducing complaints in specific or nonspecific 
musculoskeletal pain disorders (Schreuder et al. 2012, 
Gendelman et al. 2015, Yilmaz et al. 2016, Ghai et al. 
2017). In a recent meta-analysis (Table 2), Wu and 
colleagues (Wu et al. 2016) reported, in a subgroup 
analysis of vitamin D group vs placebo, that vitamin 
D supplementation for an average time duration of

3 months reduced pain in conditions such as myalgia, 
arthritis and chronic musculoskeletal pain. This result 
was observed in hospitalized patients with pain-related 
medical conditions. Although some studies have shown 
a negative association between musculoskeletal pain and 
serum 25OHD, little is known about the mechanisms 
involved in this relationship (Table 2) (Al-Jarallah et al. 
2013, Knutsen et al. 2014).
In fibromyalgia, a diffuse chronic pain syndrome, 
there are reports of an inverse relationship between 
serum 25OHD and pain. When evaluating the 25OHD 
concentrations among women with fibromyalgia, a 
study showed lower levels in younger compared to older 
women. There was no information about a control group 
(Table 2) (Bhatty et al. 2010). This study was performed 
in Pakistan, a region where women’s typical clothing 
is the burqa, which hinders endogenous vitamin D 
synthesis. Wepner and coworkers (2014) supplemented 
individuals with fibromyalgia using 2400 or 1200 IU/
day to reach serum 25OHD levels of 32–48 ng/mL 
(Table 2). According to the visual analog scale (VAS), the 
pain score of the treated group reduced over the weeks 
of supplementation. Another point to be considered 
is that vitamin D deficiency causes osteomalacia, a 
painful bone disease, which can often be confused or 
misdiagnosed as fibromyalgia (Holick 2003, Plotnikoff 
& Quigley 2003).
In rheumatic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis 
or osteoarthritis, the results for the inverse correlation 
between vitamin D and pain complaints are in the same 
direction (Table 2) (Gopinath & Danda 2011, Higgins et al. 
2013, Abourazzak et al. 2015, Yang et al. 2015). These 
disorders are also characterized as autoimmune diseases. 
For this reason, another hypothesis suggests that pain 
relief in these patients could be modulated by the action 
of 1,25(OH)2D in the immune system and not only in the 
pain-regulating mechanism. Vitamin D also presents a 
potential immunomodulatory response in autoimmune 
diseases. A prospective study, including men and women 
with an age range of 18–71 years, reported that an 
elevation of 10 
nmol/L on vitamin D status was associated 
with lower incidence of diseases such as multiple sclerosis, 
type 1 diabetes, Crohn’s disease and thyrotoxicosis 
(Skaaby et al. 2015). It is known that 1,25(OH)2D modulates 
some actions of the immune system. It suppresses the 
proinflammatory response (Th1) and stimulates the 
anti-inflammatory response (Th2), which leads to an 
immunological tolerance and consequently attenuates 
the clinical condition of the autoimmune disease (Kamen 
& Tangpricha 2010).
Other comorbidities can also cause chronic pain. 
In young individuals with sickle cell disease, both pain 
and increased bone frailty were associated with serum 
25OHD levels <20 
ng/mL (Table 2) (Osunkwo et al. 2011). 
In individuals under treatment for cancer, serum 25OHD 
levels were related to the use of opioids. Low levels of 
25OHD (<20 
ng/mL) led to higher doses of opioids for pain 
relief, while high serum 25OHD levels were a predictor of 
longevity (Table 2) (Bergman et al. 2015).
Sleep and pain
Changes in sleep pattern are common in the population 
and contribute to several impairments of the physiological 
system, leading to increased cardiovascular risk, reduction 
in immune defense, cognitive impairment and increased 
pain sensitivity (Meier-Ewert et al. 2004, Durmer & 
Dinges 2005, Nascimento et al. 2007, Zager et al. 2007, 
Roizenblatt et al. 2015).
The use of animal models has provided a better 
understanding of the effects of sleep on pain and vice-
versa, mimicking the physiological and behavioral 
manifestations observed in humans (Andersen et al. 
2006). In rats with chronic constrictive injury, lower 
sleep efficiency, a higher number of awakenings 
and longer sleep latency were observed, as well as a 
reduction in NREM sleep (Andersen & Tufik 2003). These 
results showed that pain was associated with intrinsic 
changes in sleep architecture. These findings have been 
confirmed in humans. A survey evaluating the impact 
of dysmenorrhea on sleep profile showed that women 
who had menstrual cramps presented longer REM sleep 
latency (Araujo et al. 2011). Changes in sleep pattern 
have also been found in women with fibromyalgia, who 
have shown intrusion of high-frequency brainwaves 
during NREM sleep in association with hypersensitivity 
and increased subjective pain (Smith et al. 2009). The 
reduction in both sleep efficiency and slow wave sleep 
are associated with fatigue in this disease. The treatment 
of pain conditions may be helpful for sleep quality. A 
randomized placebo-controlled study evaluated the 
efficacy of pregabalin use, a drug for fibromyalgia 
treatment, on the management of pain (Arnold et al. 
2015). Women were more prevalent in this cohort 
(93%), and the participants were taking antidepressant 
medication early in the study, such as selective serotonin 
reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or serotonin/norepinephrine 
reuptake inhibitor (SNRI). The results showed that the 
treated group had a decrease in mean pain score at

the end of the study, and sleep quality was improved 
compared to placebo.
Sleep changes can also trigger painful conditions. 
Acute reduction of sleep time in healthy pain-free 
individuals caused hyperalgesia in the following morning 
(Roehrs et al. 2006). This study also found that REM sleep 
deprivation decreased the finger withdrawal latency for 
pain sensation compared to individuals that had 8 
h of 
normal sleep. A meta-analysis corroborates these findings, 
revealing that sleep deprivation impairs pain perception 
(Schrimpf et al. 2015). Positive insomnia symptoms, at 
baseline assessment, were predictive of developing a 
painful condition (Finan et al. 2013). Insomnia frequency 
and severity among men and women ranging from 30 to 
87 years old are also related to pain sensitivity. Sivertsen 
and coworkers (2015) demonstrated a higher hazard 
ratio (52%) to painful conditions among individuals 
from both sexes who reported insomnia more than once 
a week. Just as it has been shown that decreasing pain 
improves sleep, it has also been demonstrated that a 
restorative sleep is a predictor of pain resolution. Davies 
and coworkers (2008), assessing chronic widespread 
pain and sleep quality through questionnaires, reported 
that restorative sleep was associated with chronic pain 
resolution among younger participants compared to 
individuals with chronic persistent pain. After controlling 
for confounders, restorative sleep remained as the sleep 
component associated with pain resolution.
In general, pain can cause changes in sleep pattern 
resulting in a non-restorative, superficial and fragmented 
sleep, with longer onset latency. Some painful conditions 
are frequently studied regarding sleep disorders including 
fibromyalgia, rheumatoid arthritis, low back pain, systemic 
lupus erythematosus, as well as those associated with 
Figure 1
Hypothesis about the beneficial role of vitamin D on sleep and pain. Chronic pain and sleep disorders share a bidirectional relationship, in which vitamin 
D deficiency may play an important role. The vitamin D supplementation in sleep conditions associated with vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency may 
bring benefits to the well-being and quality of life of patients. 1,25(OH)2D stimulates the anti-inflammatory response mediated by type 2 T helper cells 
(Th2), decreasing pain sensitivity, and thereby, improving sleep quality. Sleep hygiene, in addition to the treatment of sleep disorders, may also lead to a 
decrease in pain sensitivity by increasing serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D and favoring sleep pattern. MSK, musculoskeletal; OSA, obstructive sleep

comorbidities, such as dysmenorrhea, tumor, and cardiac 
or neurological diseases. A prospective study showed that 
participants (~55% women) with sleep complaints had an 
increased probability (from 14% to 38%) of developing 
chronic pain 3 years later (Bonvanie et al. 2016). Although 
many researchers support the hypothesis of a bidirectional 
relationship between sleep and pain, others suggest a 
unidirectional association, in which alterations in the 
sleep pattern predict the occurrence of pain (Finan et al. 
2013). Both longitudinal and cross-sectional studies have 
shown that sleep problems are a preponderant factor for 
the development of pain.
Sleep and pain share neurotransmitters in their 
physiological processes. Compared to wakefulness, 
during normal sleep the release of serotonin is decreased; 
under conditions of sleep deprivation, its release is 
further reduced (Blanco-Centurion & Salin-Pascual 2001, 
Roehrs et al. 2006), which contributes to nociceptive pain 
stimulation. Thus, the use of drugs, such as SSRI, SNRI or 
tricyclic antidepressants, can improve both sleep and pain 
problems as its mechanism of action inhibits serotonin 
reuptake, resulting in elevated extracellular levels of this 
neurotransmitter.
Pain is also present in individuals with OSA. In a cross-
sectional study with individuals of both sexes, morning 
headaches were more frequent in OSA patients compared 
to those without OSA (Kristiansen et al. 2011). In a 
prospective study, Johnson and coworkers (2012) reported 
that headaches in individuals with OSA improved after 
CPAP treatment. Unfortunately, the duration of CPAP 
treatment in this study was not clear.
Future perspectives: vitamin D, sleep 
and pain
Based on the literature, vitamin D status seems to have 
an important role in the bidirectional relationship 
observed between sleep and pain. A study evaluating 
the effects of cholecalciferol supplementation (1200 
IU/
day to individuals with serum 25OHD between 20 and 
29 
ng/mL and 50,000 
IU/weekly to those with serum 
25OHD <20 
ng/mL) in veterans with multiple areas of 
chronic pain found a decrease in self-reported pain in 
both supplemented groups, as well as an improvement in 
sleep pattern, with decreased sleep latency and increased 
sleep duration (Huang et al. 2013). In another study, 
patients with nonspecific chronic pain selected from 
a sleep clinic showed serum 25OHD levels <20 
ng/mL 
(McCarty et al. 2013). The risk factors for the decrease of 
vitamin D status in this study were ethnicity, obesity and 
age. In patients with hyperparathyroidism supplemented 
with vitamin D after parathyroidectomy, a decrease in RLS 
symptoms (from 56.2% to 21.0%) and pain relief were 
observed (Santos et al. 2016). Although it resulted in an 
increase in serum 25OHD levels, there was no significant 
correlation between 25OHD levels and RLS severity.
The data presented in Tables 1 and 2 highlight the 
most relevant studies linking the relationship between 
vitamin D, pain and sleep. The different study designs 
and cutoffs of vitamin D, as well as the distinct vitamin 
D supplementation protocols, make the establishment of 
adequate doses of vitamin D still difficult. Nevertheless, 
this review brings important information regarding 
the benefits of vitamin D for pain-related conditions 
and sleep disturbances. Thus, we can hypothesize that 
suitable vitamin D supplementation combined with 
sleep hygiene may optimize the therapeutic management 
of pain-related diseases such as fibromyalgia (Fig. 1). As 
1,25(OH)2D stimulates an anti-inflammatory immune 
response, this mechanism may induce an antinociceptive 
action. Sleep hygiene consists of several interventions 
to improve sleep, i.e. changes in the habits that precede 
sleep, such as avoiding the consumption of alcoholic 
and caffeinated drinks; reducing lighting in the bedroom 
and use of electronic appliances; and maintaining 
regular sleep schedules. For individuals with insomnia, 
pharmacological 
treatment 
combined 
with 
other 
techniques such as cognitive behavioral therapy is helpful 
in promoting sleep quality and reducing pain sensitivity 
(Finan et al. 2014). Finally, OSA treatment with CPAP can 
improve both pain perception and 25OHD levels. These 
data indicate the importance of considering the sleep–
pain–vitamin D inter-relationship during anamnesis by 
clinicians, sleep physicians and neurologists, so that the 
best intervention is chosen to provide the patient with a 
better quality of life.
