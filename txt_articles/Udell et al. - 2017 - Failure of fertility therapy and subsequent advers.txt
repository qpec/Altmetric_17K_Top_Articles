ertility therapy is increasingly being prescribed for women with 
infertility.1 Repeated cycles are often recommended, with 
mixed success and possible short-term metabolic risks.2–6 
However, few data are available on the long-term health effects of fer-
tility therapy, particularly following unsuccessful treatment.7 Failure 
of fertility therapy may be an early indicator of future cardiovascular 
risk by acting as a unique cardiometabolic stress test. In addition, fer-
tility therapy may lead to adverse cardiovascular events by inducing 
background thrombosis, activating the renin–angiotensin system or 
inducing vascular injury from ovarian hyperstimulation.8–16 The last 
mechanism may be further exacerbated in patients who undergo 
multiple cycles of fertility therapy or experience pregnancy miscar-
riages.17–21 An association between fertility therapy failure and long-
term cardiovascular risk could provide insight into nontraditional risk 
factors potentially contributing to the stagnation in the reduction of 
cardiovascular mortality observed among young women.22–26 
We conducted the Investigation of Notable Failed Endeavours 
at Reproductive Treatment and Ischemic Long-term Events 
(INFERTILE) study to investigate whether fertility therapy failure 
is associated with subsequent adverse cardiovascular events.
Methods
Study design and participants
The INFERTILE study was designed as a population-based longitu-
dinal cohort analysis of women aged 50 years or less who received 
fertility therapy in Ontario, Canada, between Apr. 1, 1993, and 
Mar. 31, 2011, and were followed until Mar. 31, 2015. Patients were 
identified through the Ontario Health Insurance Plan (OHIP) data-
base, which encompasses prenatal care as well as hospital and 
postnatal care. We identified individuals as having received fertility 
therapy according to whether they had 2 or more claims for super-
vision of ovulation induction with human menopausal gonadotro-
pins or gonadotropin-releasing hormone (OHIP code G334).2,27 If 
multiple treatments were present, the date of the last treatment 
was selected for primary analysis. We excluded women who were 
not residents of Ontario or who lacked a valid health card identifier.

1 year after their last fertility treatment using computerized search

ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND: Infertility may indicate an 
underlying predisposition toward prema-
ture cardiovascular disease, yet little is 
known about potential long-term cardio-
vascular events following fertility therapy. 
We investigated whether failure of fertility 
therapy is associated with subsequent 
adverse cardiovascular events.
METHODS: We performed a population-
based cohort analysis of women who re-
ceived gonadotropin-based fertility ther-
apy between Apr. 1, 1993, and Mar. 31, 
2011, distinguishing those who subse-
quently gave birth and those who did not. 
Using multivariable Poisson regression 
models, we estimated the relative rate ra-
tio of adverse cardiovascular events asso-
ciated with fertility therapy failure, ac-
counting for age, year, baseline risk 
factors, health care history and number of 
fertility cycles. The primary outcome was 
subsequent treatment for nonfatal coro-
nary ischemia, stroke, transient ischemic 
attack, heart failure or thromboembolism.
RESULTS: Of 28 442 women who received 
fertility therapy, 9349 (32.9%) subse-
quently gave birth and 19 093 (67.1%) did 
not. The median number of fertility treat-
ments was 3 (interquartile range 1–5). We 
identified 2686 cardiovascular events over 
a median 8.4 years of follow-up. The an-
nual rate of cardiovascular events was 
19% higher among women who did not 
give birth after fertility therapy than 
among those who did (1.08 v. 0.91 per 100 
patient-years, p < 0.001), equivalent to a 
21% relative increase in the annual rate 
(95% confidence interval 13%–30%). We 
observed no association between event 
rates and number of treatment cycles.
INTERPRETATION: Fertility therapy fail-
ure was associated with an increased 
risk of long-term adverse cardiovascular 
events. These women merit surveillance 
for subsequent cardiovascular events.

methods to screen for a subsequent newborn delivery (OHIP codes 
P006, P018 and P020). Overall, the OHIP databases have a high 
level of completeness (> 99%) and diagnostic accuracy (> 95%) in 
this setting.28,29 Fertility therapy failure was defined as cycles of 
treatment that were not followed by a subsequent newborn deliv-
ery within 1 year. Because individuals may have undergone re-
peated cycles of fertility therapy, we classified each woman by the 
total number of cycles of treatment by analyzing consecutive 28-
day blocks to explore potential dose–response relationships. 
The available databases lacked information on specific fertil-
ity medications because Ontario did not provide single-payer 
universal coverage for fertility prescriptions. However, human 
menopausal gonadotropins and gonadotropin-releasing hor-
mone both qualified for OHIP code G334.
Patient characteristics
We collected baseline data on demographic and clinical character-
istics from the Canadian Institute for Health Information hospital 
and outpatient databases during the 2 years before each woman’s 
final fertility treatment.28 The databases also served as the source 
for identifying follow-up outcomes, admissions and procedures. In 
addition, we used the hospital database to collect information on 
the patient’s age and sex, date of admission, and additional diag-
noses coded with the International Classification of Diseases, 9th 
revision (ICD-9; 16 diagnoses) or the International Statistical Clas-
sification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th revision 
(ICD-10; 25 diagnoses).
Some diagnoses were primarily identified outside of hospital 
(e.g., hypertension and diabetes); we used the outpatient database 
to determine selected diagnoses and aggregate health care utiliza-
tion accumulated during the 2 years before the final fertility treat-
ment.30,31 We estimated the patient’s residence location (urban or 
rural) and neighbourhood income (in quintiles) from the individu-
al’s home address. History of live births, miscarriages and stillbirths 
was ascertained over the duration of available data. We also col-
lected information on history of hypertension, diabetes, hypercho-
lesterolemia, smoking, obesity, gestational hypertension, gesta-
tional diabetes, ischemic heart disease, heart failure, atrial 
fibrillation, asthma, neoplasm and depression, and number of 
health care visits in the prior 2 years, number of fertility cycles and 
number of in-vitro fertilization procedures. Information about labo-
ratory test results and prescription medications were not available.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was a composite of medical care for nonfa-
tal coronary ischemia, acute stroke, transient ischemic attack 
(TIA), heart failure or thromboembolism. We used ICD-9 codes to 
identify study outcomes before Mar. 31, 2002, and ICD-10 codes to 
identify those diagnosed from Apr. 1, 2002, onward to account for 
changes in databases over time (Appendix 1, available at www.
cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.160744/-/DC1]). Prior vali-
dation studies suggested that these codes have mid-range sensi-
tivity (58% to 89% for coronary ischemia and heart failure), excel-
lent specificity (93% to 97% for coronary ischemia and heart 
failure) and a reasonable positive predictive value (65% to 95% for 
thromboembolism, and 90% to 92% for stroke or TIA).32–34 
Secondary outcomes were the individual components of the 
primary outcome.
Cardiovascular mortality was not included in the primary out-
come measure because of the rarity of the event (total mortality 
was examined in sensitivity analyses).
Statistical analysis
We compared baseline demographic and clinical characteristics 
between groups using the χ2 test for categorical variables and the 
t test for continuous variables. We estimated annualized event 
rates for the primary and secondary outcomes by dividing the 
total number of events by the total number of person-years of fol-
low-up. We followed all patients until study termination (Mar. 31, 
2015) and included both first and repeat events. We used Poisson 
regression models with generalized estimating equations to esti-
mate the relative rate ratio and 95% confidence interval (CI) of 
cardiovascular events associated with fertility therapy failure, 
with time zero set at 1 year following the final fertility treatment.
In multivariable analyses, we adjusted for potential con-
founders, including age (in years), calendar year, geographic resi-
dence (rural v. urban), neighbourhood income (in quintiles), prior 
health care visits, cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, dia-
betes, hypercholesterolemia, smoking and obesity), ischemic 
heart disease, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, asthma, depres-
sion, neoplasm, prior live births, miscarriages and stillbirths, and 
number of fertility cycles. We performed tests for departure from 
linearity for continuous variables before estimating a linear asso-
ciation. For patients without recorded diagnoses, we included a 
code indicating no disease so that all patients could be included 
in all analyses. We further explored potential effect modification 
by introducing interaction terms assessing fertility therapy fail-
ure with age, type of infertility (primary or secondary) and history 
of miscarriage. We tested whether a dose–response relationship 
was present by analyzing results according to whether patients 
received a single cycle or multiple cycles of fertility therapy.
We conducted survival analyses restricted to the time to first 
hospital admission for a primary outcome or death using a Cox 
proportional hazards model, with age as the underlying time 
variable to derive hazards ratios (HRs) and to check the robust-
ness of the primary analysis. Potential departures from the pro-
portionality assumption were evaluated with the introduction of 
a time-varying effect term for fertility therapy failure into the 
multivariable adjusted Cox model. 
All p values were 2-sided, and a threshold less than 0.05 was 
considered significant. All statistical analyses were performed 
with the use of SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute).

tre approved the study protocol. 
Results
A total of 28 442 women received fertility therapy during the study, of 
whom 9349 (32.9%) gave birth and 19 093 (67.1%) did not give birth 
within 1 year after the final treatment (Table 1). The mean age was

35.2 (standard deviation 4.8) years, and 23 575 (82.9%) had no prior 
obstetric deliveries. The median number of fertility cycles was 3 
(interquartile range 1–5); 7649 (26.9%) of the patients received a sin-
gle cycle of treatment, and 20 793 (73.1%) received multiple cycles.
Fertility therapy failure was most common among women 
who were older, were living in lower income neighbourhoods, 
used less health care and had fewer miscarriages or stillbirths. 
Diabetes and hypertension (including gestational presentations) 
were the 2 most common traditional cardiovascular risk factors, 
and each was less common among women who did not give birth 
following fertility therapy than among those who did (p < 0.001). 
In contrast, hypercholesterolemia (p < 0.001), smoking (p = 0.02), 
asthma (p = 0.02), neoplasm (p < 0.001) and depression (p = 0.03) 
were more common among women who did not give birth fol-
lowing fertility therapy.
During a median follow-up of 8.4 years (interquartile range 
5.3–12.4), a total of 2686 primary cardiovascular events were 
observed among women who underwent fertility therapy, of 
which 1925 occurred among women who did not subsequently 
give birth and 761 occurred among those who gave birth. The 
annual rate of cardiovascular events was 19% higher among 
women who did not give birth than among those who did follow-
ing fertility therapy (1.08 v. 0.91 events per 100 patient-years; rel-
ative rate ratio 1.19, 95% CI 1.11–1.27). The observed increase 
persisted after multivariable adjustment (adjusted relative rate 
ratio 1.21, 95% CI 1.13–1.30).
Among the specific components of the primary outcome, a 
total of 695 outpatient visits were for cerebrovascular events 
(624 ischemic strokes or TIAs, 71 hemorrhagic strokes), 940 for 
venothromboembolism, 567 for coronary ischemia and 484 for 
heart failure. The overall increase in the cardiovascular event 
rate was explained mostly by increases in the rate of heart failure 
(adjusted relative rate ratio 2.25, 95% CI 2.06–2.46) and cerebro-
vascular events (adjusted relative rate ratio 1.25, 95% CI 1.15–
1.37), with an adjusted relative rate ratio of 1.08 for venothrom-
boembolic events (95% CI 1.00–1.17). In contrast, no increase 
was observed between fertility therapy failure and coronary isch-
emia (Table 2). When cerebrovascular risk was further subcate-
gorized, fertility therapy failure was associated with an increased 
risk of ischemic stroke (adjusted relative rate ratio 1.33, 95% CI 
1.22–1.46) but not hemorrhagic stroke (adjusted relative rate 
ratio 0.88, 95% CI 0.80–0.96).
In the survival analysis restricted to the time to first hospital 
admission for the composite outcome of a cardiovascular end-
point or death, the risk was increased among women who had 
fertility therapy failure compared with women who gave birth 
following fertility treatment (0.11 v. 0.08 events per 100 patient-
years; adjusted HR 1.42, 95% CI 1.06–1.92) (Figure 1). A check of 
the consistency of the HR over time with the introduction of a 
time-dependent interaction term was significant (p = 0.002), 
which suggested departure from the proportional hazards as-
sumption. In particular, the first year of follow-up showed the 
largest relative risk associated with fertility therapy failure for the 
composite of hospital admission for a cardiovascular event or 
death (adjusted HR 4.24, 95% CI 1.90–9.44). The trajectory there-
after of cardiovascular risk following fertility therapy failure ap-

proached that of cardiovascular risk following successful fertility 
therapy by about 5 years after final treatment. Restriction of the 
survival analysis to focus only on the time to first hospital admis-
sion for a cardiovascular event resulted in similar results, with 
the highest relative risk in the first year of follow-up (adjusted HR 
3.21, 95% CI 1.24–8.34).
We observed no statistically significant heterogeneity in car-
diovascular risk associated with fertility therapy failure across 
subgroups (all interaction p values > 0.1), except possibly accord-
ing to history of miscarriage (interaction p = 0.06). In this sub-
group, the increased risk appeared accentuated among women 
with a history of miscarriage (Figure 2). Of note, no subgroup 
showed a lower subsequent risk of adverse cardiovascular 
events associated with fertility therapy failure, including women 
who underwent only a single cycle of treatment (Figure 3).
Interpretation
In our cohort of more than 28 000 women, fertility therapy failure 
was common and was associated with an increased risk of 
adverse cardiovascular events. The largest relative increases were 
for heart failure and cerebrovascular events. The overall higher 
relative risk of cardiovascular events associated with fertility ther-
apy failure was observed in diverse demographic subgroups, irre-
spective of the number of fertility treatment cycles and regardless 
of whether the diagnosis was primary or secondary infertility. The 
increased risk was particularly high among women with a prior 
miscarriage. The absolute risk was modest and the relative risk 
was mostly confined to the first 5 years following fertility therapy.
Several mechanisms may underlie our findings, as suggested 
by past studies linking fertility therapy, ovarian hyperstimulation 
and vascular complications.10,11 Prior population-based reports of 
women receiving fertility therapy (including in vitro fertilization) 
indicated an increased risk of pulmonary embolism throughout 
pregnancy, post partum10,11 and over subsequent years.12 An 
increased risk of thrombosis persists after the birth of a child con-
ceived with the help of fertility therapy and may extend to women 
following fertility therapy failure. The risk may become increas-
ingly relevant as more women with comorbidities contemplate 
reproduction with fertility therapy.35,36 The risk may also become 
more relevant as specific employers propose oocyte cryopreser-
vation for future fertility as a workplace benefit.37,38

The cause of cerebrovascular events and heart failure follow-
ing fertility therapy failure is likely complex.8,9,39 One potential 
mechanism is direct activation of the renin–angiotensin system 
with ovarian hyperstimulation,13–15 which influences systemic 
vascular permeability, sodium balance and blood pressure.16 
Fluid shifts may result in depletion of intravascular volume and 
interstitial edema that mediates ischemic stroke, heart failure 
and venothromboembolic risks during pregnancy and poten-
tially thereafter.
Whether these cardiovascular events could be prevented by 
long-term renin–angiotensin inhibitor therapy is a topic for future 
research, although some short-term success has been described 
for the early adverse effects of ovarian hyperstimulation.40,41 Addi-
tional potential options to protect against thromboembolism 
might include the control of risk factors or prophylactic antiplate-
let therapy.42 In contrast, an observed decreased risk of coronary 
events following fertility therapy failure appears inconsistent with 
the hypothesis that endothelial dysfunction may already be pres-
ent in women at risk of miscarriage and may become accentuated 
by fertility therapy failure.19
Alternatively, fertility treatment may be innocuous and merely 
unmask a latent predisposition to premature cardiovascular dis-
ease among individuals at risk of infertility.22–25,43 Our prior 
research showed that women who delivered following fertility 
therapy had more short-term adverse cardiometabolic events but 
lower long-term cardiovascular risk compared with women who

women to receive fertility therapy, a bias that might mask poten-
tial detrimental biologic consequences. Together, these findings 
are consistent with the hypothesis that fertility therapy failure may 
represent an early indication for future cardiovascular disease 
because it represents a unique cardiometabolic stress test. As a 
result, the time following fertility therapy may be an opportunity 
to identify young women at increased risk of future cardiovascular 
events and initiate early strategies to modify risk factors (an 
opportunity that is currently unrecognized). This interpretation, 
however, warrants confirmation in further studies.
Limitations
Our approach provided a comprehensive evaluation of women fol-
lowing fertility therapy, yet the results should be interpreted with 
caution. In particular, we could not ascertain less invasive forms of 
fertility therapy, and information was not available about other 
clinical factors not detailed in administrative data, such as blood 
pressure, cholesterol levels and ventricular function. We could not 
distinguish among early types of fertility therapy failure and a 
small number of women who may have undergone ovarian induc-
tion for fertility preservation or egg donation. Although we could 
not definitively address whether successive cycles of fertility ther-
apy were associated with increased cardiovascular risk, future 
studies using propensity-based methodology seem warranted to 
minimize selection bias and reduce confounding by indication. 
Finally, we combined diverse cardiovascular events for our com-
posite outcome, which should be interpreted with caution 
because underlying mechanisms and risk factors may be different.
Conclusion
Fertility therapy failure was associated with an increased risk of 
long-term adverse cardiovascular events. A potential increase in 
cardiovascular events may become increasingly relevant with 
broader utilization of fertility therapy and longer follow-up. More 
informed decision-making around reproductive technology 
requires an awareness of potential risks and the need for contin-
ued long-term clinical care. Fertility therapy failure may be 
another sex-specific cardiovascular risk factor that warrants fur-
ther research to identify women who may benefit from a cardio-
vascular risk evaluation.
