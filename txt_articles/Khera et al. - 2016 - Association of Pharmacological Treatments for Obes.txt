IMPORTANCE Five medications have been approved for the management of obesity, but data
on comparative effectiveness are limited.
OBJECTIVE To compare weight loss and adverse events among drug treatments for obesity
using a systematic review and network meta-analysis.
DATA SOURCES MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, Scopus, and Cochrane Central from
inception to March 23, 2016; clinical trial registries.
STUDY SELECTION Randomized clinical trials conducted among overweight and obese adults
treated with US Food and Drug Administration–approved long-term weight loss agents
(orlistat, lorcaserin, naltrexone-bupropion, phentermine-topiramate, or liraglutide) for at
least 1 year compared with another active agent or placebo.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Two investigators identified studies and independently
abstracted data using a predefined protocol. A Bayesian network meta-analysis was
performed and relative ranking of agents was assessed using surface under the cumulative
ranking (SUCRA) probabilities. Quality of evidence was assessed using GRADE criteria.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Proportions of patients with at least 5% weight loss and at
least 10% weight loss, magnitude of decrease in weight, and discontinuation of therapy
because of adverse events at 1 year.
RESULTS Twenty-eight randomized clinical trials with 29 018 patients (median age, 46 years;
74% women; median baseline body weight, 100.5 kg; median baseline body mass index, 36.1)
were included. A median 23% of placebo participants had at least 5% weight loss vs 75% of
participants taking phentermine-topiramate (odds ratio [OR], 9.22; 95% credible interval [CrI],
6.63-12.85; SUCRA, 0.95), 63% of participants taking liraglutide (OR, 5.54; 95% CrI, 4.16-7.78;
SUCRA, 0.83), 55% taking naltrexone-bupropion (OR, 3.96; 95% CrI, 3.03-5.11; SUCRA, 0.60),
49% taking lorcaserin (OR, 3.10; 95% CrI, 2.38-4.05; SUCRA, 0.39), and 44% taking orlistat
(OR, 2.70; 95% CrI, 2.34-3.09; SUCRA, 0.22). All active agents were associated with significant
excess weight loss compared with placebo at 1 year—phentermine-topiramate, 8.8 kg (95% CrI,
−10.20 to −7.42 kg); liraglutide, 5.3 kg (95% CrI, −6.06 to −4.52 kg); naltrexone-bupropion,
5.0 kg (95% CrI, −5.94 to −3.96 kg); lorcaserin, 3.2 kg (95% CrI, −3.97 to −2.46 kg); and orlistat,
2.6 kg (95% CrI, −3.04 to −2.16 kg). Compared with placebo, liraglutide (OR, 2.95; 95% CrI,
2.11-4.23) and naltrexone-bupropion (OR, 2.64; 95% CrI, 2.10-3.35) were associated with the
highest odds of adverse event–related treatment discontinuation. High attrition rates
(30%-45% in all trials) were associated with lower confidence in estimates.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among overweight or obese adults, orlistat, lorcaserin,
naltrexone-bupropion, phentermine-topiramate, and liraglutide, compared with placebo, were
each associated with achieving at least 5% weight loss at 52 weeks. Phentermine-topiramate
and liraglutide were associated with the highest odds of achieving at least 5% weight loss.

Bayesian network meta-analysis.
Methods
This systematic review is reported according to the Preferred
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses
(PRISMA) statement extension for network meta-analysis5 and
was conducted following an a priori–established protocol
registered with PROSPERO (CRD42015026114).6 Good re-
search practices outlined in the International Society for
Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research report on
interpretingindirecttreatmentcomparisonsandnetworkmeta-
analysis for health care decision making were followed.7
Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and
Evaluation (GRADE) criteria for network meta-analysis were
used to appraise quality of evidence.8
Selection Criteria
Randomized clinical trials were included in this meta-analysis
iftheystudiedanyofthe5FDA-approvedweightlossdrugsad-
ministeredatthemosteffectiverecommendeddosesforatleast
1yearcomparedwitheitherplacebooreachotherinobese(BMI
≥30) or overweight (BMI ≥27) adults (aged ≥18 years), with or
without weight-associated comorbidities, and reported either
proportion of patients achieving at least 5% weight loss or dif-
ferences in mean weight loss between different study groups.
Observational studies, trials of short-term or nonap-
proved pharmacological agents (eg, rimonabant, sibutra-
mine), trials comparing individual components of the
approved fixed-dose combination medications (eg,
naltrexone-bupropion, phentermine-topiramate), studies in
special populations (patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver
disease or polycystic ovary syndrome), and studies compar-
ing an active agent with another nonapproved weight loss
therapy (eg, metformin, statins) were excluded.
Search Strategy
The search strategy was designed and conducted by an expe-
rienced medical librarian with input from study investigators
using various databases from inception to March 23, 2016. The
databases included Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of
Science, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials.
Clinical trial registries (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov and http:
//www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu), conference proceedings, and
published systematic reviews were screened for additional
studies. Details of the search strategy and study selection
procedures are shown in the eAppendix in the Supplement.
Data Abstraction and Quality Assessment
Data on study-, patient- and treatment-related characteris-
ticswereabstractedontoastandardizedformby2authors(R.K.
and A.K.C.) independently and discrepancies were resolved by
consensus in consultation with a third reviewer (S.S.). Details
of the data abstraction are reported in the eAppendix in the
Supplement.Whentrialsrandomizedpatientstodifferentdos-
ages of the active intervention, only data for the most effec-
tive FDA-approved dosage of the medication (orlistat, 120 mg
3 times daily; lorcaserin, 10 mg twice daily; naltrexone-
bupropion, 32 mg/360 mg twice daily; phentermine-
topiramate, 15 mg/92 mg once daily; and liraglutide, 3-mg sub-
cutaneous injection daily) were used.2-4 The risk of bias of
individual studies was assessed in the context of the primary
outcome using the Cochrane Risk of Bias assessment tool.9
Outcomes
All outcomes were assessed at 1 year of follow-up (52 [±4]
weeks). The primary outcome was the proportion of patients
achieving at least 5% weight loss from baseline, since this is
the primary efficacy outcome mandated by the FDA in trials
evaluating weight loss drugs and associated with clinically sig-
nificant improvement in metabolic risk profile.10,11 Second-
ary weight loss outcomes were the proportion of individuals
with at least 10% weight loss and change in weight from base-
line. The primary adverse event outcome was rate of discon-
tinuation of treatment due to adverse events. Serious ad-
verse events were not consistently defined or reported.
All data were abstracted using study-reported modified
intention-to-treatanalysis(ie,patientswhoreceivedatleast1dose
ofthedrugandhad1postrandomizationweightassessment);im-
putationofmissingvalueswasperformedinallstudiesusinglast
observation carried forward (LOCF) in accordance with FDA
guidelines regarding trials of weight loss agents.10
Quality of Evidence
The GRADE approach was used to rate the quality of evidence
of estimates derived from network meta-analysis.8 In this ap-
proach,directevidencefromRCTsstartsathighqualityandcan
be downgraded based on risk of bias, indirectness, impreci-
sion, inconsistency (or heterogeneity), and/or publication bias
to levels of moderate, low, and very low quality. The rating of
indirect estimates starts at the lowest rating of the 2 pairwise
estimates that contribute as first-order loops to the indirect es-
timate but can be downgraded further for imprecision or in-
transitivity (dissimilarity between studies in clinical or meth-
odologicalcharacteristics).Ifdirectandindirectestimateswere
similar (ie, coherent), then the higher of their ratings was as-
signed to the network meta-analysis estimates.

Statistical Analysis
Direct meta-analysis was performed using DerSimonian and
Laird random-effects model to estimate pooled odds ratios
(ORs) and 95% confidence intervals incorporating within- and
between-study heterogeneity.12 Statistical heterogeneity was
assessed using the I2 statistic, with values higher than 50% in-
dicating substantial heterogeneity.13 In post hoc sensitivity
analyses, summary estimates were also derived using the
Hartung-Knapp method to address possible type I error with
the conventional DerSimonian and Laird approach.14 Publi-
cation bias was assessed by examining funnel-plot symmetry
and using the Egger regression test, with P < .05 suggesting
publication bias.15,16
To incorporate indirect comparisons with direct compari-
sons, random-effects Bayesian network meta-analyses were
conducted using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods in
WinBUGS version 1.4.3 (MRC Biostatistics Unit) and methods
described by Lu and Ades.17,18 The relative ranking of agents
on weight loss and adverse events outcomes was presented as
their surface under the cumulative ranking (SUCRA) probabili-
ties, which represent their likelihood of being ranked best.19
In this study, higher SUCRA scores reflect higher associated
weight loss and a lower rate of adverse events. Furthermore,
using ORs derived from the network meta-analysis for pla-
cebo comparisons and median placebo response rate as the as-
sumed control risk, absolute event rates for each interven-
tionwereestimated.20Detailsofthestatisticalanalysisandthe
WinBUGS code are reported in the eAppendix in the Supple-
ment. The level of statistical significance was set at P < .05 and
all statistical tests were 2-sided.
Multiple sensitivity analyses were performed to assess
the robustness of the findings. These were based on (1) use
of an alternative statistical approach (random-effects fre-
quentist model)21; (2) restricting only to studies in adults
without diabetes (because antidiabetic medications may
have independent weight-modifying effects); and (3) replac-
ing trials of high-dose phentermine-topiramate with
standard-dose phentermine-topiramate (7.5 mg/46 mg once
daily). Additional post hoc sensitivity analyses were per-
formed given potential bias associated with LOCF imputation

using (1) worst-case scenario analysis, wherein all patients
who were randomized but did not undergo assessment of
outcomes at the end of the study were considered treatment
failures and (2) complete-case analysis, which limited analy-
sis to patients who completed the entire study and under-
went an assessment at the end of the trial.
Results
From a total of 3616 unique studies identified using the search
strategy, 28 RCTs were included in this network meta-
analysis. These included 27 two-group trials comparing ac-
tive intervention to placebo (orlistat, 16 trials22-37; lorcaserin,
3 trials38-40; naltrexone-bupropion, 4 trials41-44; phentermine-
topiramate, 2 trials45,46; liraglutide, 2 trials47,48) and 1 three-
grouptrialcomparingliraglutideandorlistatagainstplacebo.49
Study selection is shown in Figure 1. The available direct com-
parisons and network of trials are shown in Figure 2 and eFig-
ure 1 in the Supplement.
Characteristics and Quality of Included Studies
The RCTs included in the network meta-analysis are summa-
rized in Table 1 and Table 2. Overall, these 28 trials were re-
ported between 1998 and 2015 and included 29 018 partici-
pants (the range of size of trials was 220 to 3731 participants).
The primary outcome (proportion of patients achieving at least
5% weight loss at 1 year) was reported in all studies except one,
which reported only weight loss on a continuous scale.36
Thebaselinecharacteristicsofpatientsincludedinthesetrials
are described in eTable 1 in the Supplement. The median of av-
erage age of study participants was 45.9 years (range of average
age,40.0-59.8years)and74%ofparticipantswerewomen(range,
45%-92%). The median of average BMI of patients was 36.1
(range,32.6-42.0)andthemedianofaveragebaselineweightwas
100.5kg(range,95.3-115.8kg).Sixteentrialswereperformedex-
clusivelyinpatientswithoutdiabetes(ordiet-controlleddiabe-
tes), whereas 8 trials were conducted in patients with diabetes
treated with pharmacological therapy. Baseline patient charac-
teristics and prognostic factors were comparably distributed in
the active and comparator groups and across different trials. In
alltrials,participantsreceivedstandarddietaryandlifestylecoun-
selingwithoutastructuredintervention;in1trial,allparticipants
received intensive behavioral modification.44
Overall, studies were considered to be at high risk of
bias, with attrition rates of 30% to 45% in all trials. Overall
and study-level quality assessments are summarized in eFig-
ure 2 in the Supplement.
Direct Meta-analysis
Results of direct pairwise meta-analysis are summarized in
Table 3 and eFigure 3 in the Supplement. All agents were asso-
ciated with higher proportions of patients achieving at least 5%
andatleast10%weightlosscomparedwithplacebo.Overall,the
excess weight loss compared with placebo (ie, weighted mean

Network Meta-analysis—Weight Loss Outcomes
Proportion of Patients With at Least 5% and at Least 10% Weight Loss
In network meta-analysis, compared with placebo, orlistat was
associatedwithanORof2.70(95%credibleinterval[CrI],2.34-
3.09) , lorcaserin with an OR of 3.10 (95% CrI, 2.38-4.05),
naltrexone-bupropion with an OR of 3.96 (95% CrI, 3.03-
5.11), phentermine-topiramate an OR of 9.22 (95% CrI, 6.63-
12.85), and liraglutide with an OR of 5.54 (95% CrI, 4.16-7.78)
for achieving at least 5% weight loss (Figure 3). All agents were
also associated with higher odds of at least 10% weight loss
from baseline compared with placebo (eTable 3 in the Supple-
ment). Placebo was associated with a 23% median rate of
achieving at least 5% weight loss while phentermine-
topiramate was associated with achieving at least 5% weight
loss in an estimated 75% of participants, liraglutide in an es-
timated 63%, naltrexone-bupropion in an estimated 55%, lor-
caserin in an estimated 49%, and orlistat in an estimated 44%
(eTable 4 in the Supplement). Similarly, with a 9% median rate
of achieving at least 10% weight loss in placebo-treated
patients, phentermine-topiramate was associated with
achieving at least 10% weight loss in an estimated 54% of
participants, liraglutide in an estimated 34%, naltrexone-
bupropioninanestimated30%,lorcaserininanestimated25%,
and orlistat in an estimated 20%.

Network meta-analysis suggested that phentermine-
topiramate, 15 mg/92 mg once daily, was associated with the
highestprobabilityofachievingatleast5%weightloss(SUCRA,
0.95), followed by liraglutide (SUCRA, 0.83), naltrexone-
bupropion (SUCRA, 0.60), lorcaserin (SUCRA, 0.39), and
orlistat (SUCRA, 0.22) (Figure 4). Similarly, phentermine-
topiramate was associated with the highest probability of
achieving at least 10% weight loss (SUCRA, 0.99), followed
by liraglutide (SUCRA, 0.71), naltrexone-bupropion (SUCRA,
0.64), lorcaserin (SUCRA, 0.44), and orlistat (SUCRA, 0.16).
Weight Loss in Excess of Placebo
Innetworkmeta-analysis,allactiveagentswereassociatedwith
significant excess weight loss vs placebo at 1 year—orlistat,
2.6 kg (95% CrI, −3.04 to −2.16 kg); lorcaserin, 3.2 kg (95% CrI,
−3.97to−2.46kg);naltrexone-bupropion,5.0kg(95%CrI,−5.94
to −3.96 kg); phentermine-topiramate, 8.8 kg (95% CrI, −10.20
to −7.42 kg); and liraglutide, 5.3 kg (95% CrI, −6.06 to −4.52 kg).
Network meta-analysis also suggested that phentermine-
topiramate,15mg/92mgoncedaily,wasassociatedwithsignifi-
cantexcessweightlosscomparedwithallactiveagents(change
vsorlistat,6.2kg;vslorcaserin,5.6kg;vsnaltrexone-bupropion,
3.9 kg; and vs liraglutide, 3.5 kg) (eTable 3 in the Supplement).
Sensitivity Analysis
Results from multiple sensitivity analyses are reported in
eTables 5-8 in the Supplement. Overall, the results were simi-
lar to the main analysis for the primary outcome in sensitiv-
ity analyses based on (1) alternative statistical model (frequen-
tist approach using a random-effects inconsistency model,
worst-case scenario, complete-case analysis); (2) restricting to
only studies in adults without diabetes; and (3) replacing trials
of high-dose phentermine-topiramate with standard-dose
phentermine-topiramate (7.5 mg/46 mg once daily).
Network Meta-analysis—Adverse Event Outcome
In network meta-analysis, compared with placebo, all active
agents had 1.3 to 2.9 higher odds of being associated with
discontinuation due to adverse events (Figure 3). Compared
with placebo, lorcaserin was associated with the lowest
odds of being discontinued because of adverse events (OR,
1.34; 95% CrI, 1.05-1.76; SUCRA, 0.61), whereas liraglutide
(OR, 2.95; 95% CrI, 2.11-4.23; SUCRA, 0.20) and naltrexone-
bupropion (OR, 2.64; 95% CrI, 2.10-3.35; SUCRA, 0.23) were
associated with the highest odds of being discontinued
because of adverse events (Figure 4 and eTable 4 in the
Supplement). Details of the most commonly observed
adverse events and reported reasons for discontinuation are
shown in eTable 9 in the Supplement.
Publication Bias and Network Coherence
There was no evidence of publication bias, either qualita-
tively based on funnel-plot asymmetry (eFigure 4 in the
Supplement) or quantitatively (Egger regression test, P > .05
for all comparisons), although the number of studies in-
cluded in each comparison was very small. There were no sig-
nificant differences between direct and indirect estimates in
the only closed loop that allowed assessment of network co-
herence(placebo-orlistat-liraglutide).Visualinspectionoftrace
plots and evaluation of the Monte Carlo error and the Brooks-
Gelman-Rubin statistic suggested adequacy of burn-in and
convergence.50 Values of the total residual deviance sug-
gested good model fit.
Quality of Evidence
Given high attrition rates for all trials (30%-45%), evidence
was downgraded for risk of bias. Although several compari-
sons had statistically significant heterogeneity, the differ-
ence was primarily in the magnitude of effect size, not in the
direction of effect, and hence, evidence was not down-
graded for inconsistency. On applying GRADE to findings
from the network meta-analysis combining direct and indi-
rect evidence, there was moderate-quality evidence for all
agents being associated with higher odds of achieving at
least 5% weight loss compared with placebo. In comparing
different drugs against each other, there was moderate-
quality evidence for phentermine-topiramate being associ-
ated with higher odds of achieving weight loss compared
with all other drugs. There was also moderate-quality evi-
dence for liraglutide being associated with higher odds of
achieving weight loss compared with orlistat and lorcaserin
and low-quality evidence for liraglutide being associated
with higher odds of achieving weight loss compared with
naltrexone-bupropion (which was downgraded for impreci-
sion and risk of bias) (eTable 10 in the Supplement).

Surface under the cumulative rankings (SUCRAs) between 0 and 1 represent the
probability of being ranked highest. For the weight loss outcomes, higher score
corresponds to higher proportion achieving at least 5% weight loss with a
particular therapy. For the adverse event outcome, higher scores reflect lower
probability of discontinuation due to adverse events. The median ranks on both
weight loss and adverse event rates (rank 1 through 6 on each scale) are
tabulated along with their corresponding 95% credible intervals (95% CrIs).

Discussion
In this systematic review and network meta-analysis, direct
and indirect evidence from 28 RCTs in 29 018 overweight and
obese patients was combined to compare the association of
each drug with relative weight loss and adverse events. The
studyhasseveralkeyfindings.First,withatleast1yearoftreat-
ment,orlistat,lorcaserin,naltrexone-bupropion,phentermine-
topiramate, and liraglutide are all associated with higher odds
of achieving weight loss compared with placebo, with mod-
erate confidence in estimates. Second, phentermine-
topiramatewasassociatedwithhigheroddsofachievingweight
loss of at least 5% and weight loss of at least 10% compared
with all other active agents, with moderate confidence in es-
timates, and there was no difference in the odds of adverse
event–related drug discontinuation among phentermine-
topiramate, liraglutide, and naltrexone-bupropion. Third, li-
raglutide was associated with higher odds of weight loss of at
least 5% and weight loss of at least 10% compared with orli-
stat, lorcaserin, and naltrexone-bupropion, with low to mod-
erate confidence in estimates, but was associated with higher
odds of discontinuation due to adverse events.
The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends refer-
ralofallobeseadultstointensive,multicomponentinterventions
includingbehavioralinterventions,pharmacologicaltherapies,
andsurgicalweightlossprocedures.51TheEndocrineSocietyalso
suggests the use of approved weight loss medications for long-
term weight maintenance, to ameliorate comorbidities, and to
enhance adherence to behavior changes.52 However, there are
nocurrentrecommendationstoguidecliniciansregardingchoice
of individual drugs.
The present study found moderate-quality evidence for
phentermine-topiramate being associated with higher odds of
achievingpredefinedthresholdsofclinicallymeaningfulweight
loss compared with other currently approved agents. The odds
of discontinuation of therapy due to medication-related ad-
verse events was not different for phentermine-topiramate, li-
raglutide, and naltrexone-bupropion. While lorcaserin and or-
listat were associated with lower rates of adverse events, they
were also associated with lower rates of achieving all weight
loss outcomes. Besides weight loss, treatment decisions may
also be driven by coexisting medical conditions, which may
either favor or preclude the use of specific agents.2 For ex-
ample, liraglutide may be a more appropriate agent in people
with diabetes because of its glucose-lowering effects.47 Con-
versely, naltrexone-bupropion in patients with chronic opiate
or alcohol dependence may be associated with neuropsychi-
atriccomplications.2Ultimately,giventhedifferencesinsafety,
efficacy, and response to therapy, the ideal approach to weight
loss should be highly individualized, identifying appropriate
candidatesforpharmacotherapy,behavioralinterventions,and
surgical interventions.53 Historically, concerns regarding the
long-term safety profile of pharmacotherapy for weight loss
have limited their clinical use, particularly among medica-
tions with significant adrenergic actions (eg, sibutramine) or
centralappetite-suppressingactions(eg,rimonabant).54Short-
term clinical trials may not provide comprehensive informa-
tion on the long-term safety of these agents, and prospective
postmarketing surveillance studies are warranted.
This study has limitations. First, there was a paucity of di-
rect comparative studies. Four of the 5 studied agents received
approvalfromtheFDAwithinthelast3years,andbecausethere
isnoestablishedstandardweightlossagentagainstwhichanew
agent needs to be compared for approval, there is a paucity of
head-to-headtrials.Second,thebiggestthreattovalidityofthe

iedinterventions,cointerventions/backgroundtherapy,outcome

Cointerventions in the studies, including diet and exercise rec-
ommendations and behavioral modification, were similar, al-
though rigor of implementation and adherence by trial partici-
pantswasnotroutinelymeasured,andtheirassociationwiththe
relative efficacy of active interventions is unclear. Third, rank-
ing probabilities may be affected by unequal numbers of trials

these data (using an LOCF imputation as suggested by the FDA
guidelines),thereareunaddressedconcernsregardingthelong-
term effect of weight loss agents in a clinical setting.
Conclusions
Among overweight or obese adults, orlistat, lorcaserin,
naltrexone-bupropion, phentermine-topiramate, and liraglu-
tide, compared with placebo, were each associated with
achieving at least 5% weight loss at 52 weeks. Phentermine-
topiramate and liraglutide were associated with the highest
odds of achieving at least 5% weight loss.
